and pretend I was shopping
for a puppy for 30 minutes

168
00:07:12,491 --> 00:07:14,159
until he finally went away.

169
00:07:14,242 --> 00:07:16,411
Ooh, is that the pet store
where they got the pup cam

170
00:07:16,495 --> 00:07:17,872
where you can watch the pups play online?

171
00:07:17,955 --> 00:07:19,999
There's, like, a live feed of the pup pen?

172
00:07:20,081 --> 00:07:22,209
Sorry, not an appropriate
response to that story.

173
00:07:22,292 --> 00:07:23,502
Denise, you ever been followed?

174
00:07:23,585 --> 00:07:24,628
Hell, yeah.

175
00:07:24,712 --> 00:07:26,463
One time,
I went to the movies by myself, right?

176
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:28,048
Theater full of empty seats.

177
00:07:28,131 --> 00:07:30,258
This dude comes and sits down
right next to me,

178
00:07:30,342 --> 00:07:31,802
being a creeper the whole time.

179
00:07:31,886 --> 00:07:33,554
Then after the movie,
he followed my ass home.

180
00:07:33,637 --> 00:07:36,139
Had to pretend my cell phone was a Taser
just to scare him away.

181
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:37,516
Damn. What movie was it?

182
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:38,934
<i>Failure to Launch.</i>

183
00:07:39,018 --> 00:07:42,187
The Matthew McConaughey rom-com?
Why'd you see that?

184
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,605
Okay, after that story,
you're criticizing me

185
00:07:43,689 --> 00:07:44,606
for my movie choice?

186
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:45,607
Kind of.

187
00:07:45,691 --> 00:07:47,026
You saw it in the theaters?

188
00:07:47,108 --> 00:07:48,068
What, you see the trailer and you thought

189
00:07:48,151 --> 00:07:49,653
it looked interesting?

190
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:52,072
Okay, first off,
Sarah Jessica Parker is bae.

191
00:07:52,155 --> 00:07:54,033
And you know I got
diverse cultural tastes.

192
00:07:54,115 --> 00:07:55,993
Uh, interesting that you'd
go see<i> Failure to Launch, </i>

193
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:57,828
but when I invited you to see
<i>You, Me and Dupree,</i>

194
00:07:57,912 --> 00:07:58,871
you said, "Nah."

195
00:07:58,954 --> 00:08:00,039
Uh, 'cause my girl

196
00:08:00,121 --> 00:08:02,041
Sarah Jessica Parker isn't in that one.

197
00:08:02,123 --> 00:08:04,251
True. She did kill it
in<i> Ghosts of Girlfriends Past.</i>

198
00:08:04,334 --> 00:08:05,293
That's Jennifer Garner.

199
00:08:05,377 --> 00:08:06,628
She killed it too.

200
00:08:06,712 --> 00:08:08,171
Look, none of that matters.

201
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:10,131
If you're born with a vagina,
everybody knows

202
00:08:10,215 --> 00:08:11,592
creepy dudes are just a part of the deal.

203
00:08:11,675 --> 00:08:13,052
Yeah, there are a million things that guys

204
00:08:13,134 --> 00:08:15,012
have no clue about that are so annoying.

205
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:16,597
I don't tell anybody about half of it.

206
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,223
Like what?

207
00:08:18,306 --> 00:08:20,559
Uh, okay, so you remember
when we went to brunch

208
00:08:20,642 --> 00:08:22,310
and we both Instagrammed
the picture of that frittata?

209
00:08:22,394 --> 00:08:24,229
Ooh, that frittata was fluffy as hell.

210
00:08:24,312 --> 00:08:25,230
Okay, pull it up.

211
00:08:25,313 --> 00:08:26,523
What are your comments?

212
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:29,192
Um, I got one from Arnold.

213
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:31,820
"Yum town. Population: Dev."

214
00:08:31,904 --> 00:08:33,072
All right.

215
00:08:33,154 --> 00:08:34,448
Check mine out.

216
00:08:34,531 --> 00:08:36,157
"I want to fuck your face"?

217
00:08:36,241 --> 00:08:37,158
Who said that?

218
00:08:37,242 --> 00:08:38,911
Some random person

219
00:08:38,994 --> 00:08:41,329
with a dick who wanted to use it
to fuck my face.

220
00:08:41,413 --> 00:08:42,790
It's not even a picture of my face.

221
00:08:42,873 --> 00:08:44,374
It's eggs.

222
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,334
That's why I had to make
my account private.

223
00:08:46,418 --> 00:08:47,628
Oh, man, that's the worst.

224
00:08:47,711 --> 00:08:49,088
Listen, tell us something.

225
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,214
What can two gentlemen like us do to help?

226
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:52,215
I don't know.

227
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:53,842
Don't do that stuff?

228
00:08:53,926 --> 00:08:56,219
So don't follow women around,

229
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:57,972
and don't write,
"I want to fuck your face,"

230
00:08:58,055 --> 00:08:58,973
on Instagram?

231
00:08:59,056 --> 00:09:00,599
I'll do it.

232
00:09:00,682 --> 00:09:03,435
Although, just so you guys know,
even before all of this,

233
00:09:03,518 --> 00:09:04,853
I consider myself a feminist.

234
00:09:04,937 --> 00:09:06,480
Really, Arnold?

235
00:09:06,563 --> 00:09:08,107
A feminist is a person
that thinks men and women

236
00:09:08,189 --> 00:09:09,733
should be treated equally.

237
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:11,151
And I fully support that.

238
00:09:11,234 --> 00:09:13,779
So, my good sir, I'm a feminist.

239
00:09:13,862 --> 00:09:15,948
Wow, I'm really impressed you knew that.

240
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,992
Dude, I know tons of fun facts.

241
00:09:18,075 --> 00:09:20,702
For example, did you know
that all the ants in the world

242
00:09:20,786 --> 00:09:23,080
weigh as much as
all the humans in the world?

243
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:25,373
I'm just saying,
if they possessed our intelligence

244
00:09:25,457 --> 00:09:29,461
and could somehow organize,
it'd be a fair fight.

245
00:09:29,544 --> 00:09:30,587
So I'm gonna pick up that couch

246
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:31,964
from that Craigslist guy today.

247
00:09:32,047 --> 00:09:32,965
Can you come with me?

248
00:09:33,048 --> 00:09:33,966
Sorry, boo, I got to get back

249
00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:35,676
to the Garden Depot commercial.

250
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:36,969
I could do it.

251
00:09:37,052 --> 00:09:39,220
My large stature can keep you safe.

252
00:09:39,304 --> 00:09:42,182
I'm a great negotiator,
get you those primo prices.

253
00:09:42,265 --> 00:09:43,308
And I can help you carry it home.

254
00:09:43,391 --> 00:09:44,852
That sounds great.

255
00:09:44,935 --> 00:09:45,853
Though you definitely didn't need

256
00:09:45,936 --> 00:09:47,021
to provide three reasons.

257
00:09:47,104 --> 00:09:48,647
Nobody else was itching to go.

258
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,649
Well, like I said, I'm a great negotiator.

259
00:09:52,901 --> 00:09:55,696
So what's it like being a giant?

260
00:09:55,779 --> 00:09:57,114
It's pretty good.

261
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:58,949
I always have a good view at a concert.

262
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:00,784
Planes are tough, though.

263
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:02,369
What's it like being tiny?

264
00:10:02,452 --> 00:10:03,787
Oh, it's fine.

265
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:06,665
Planes are great. Concerts are tough.

266
00:10:06,748 --> 00:10:09,334
I wonder what experiences
are similar for us.

267
00:10:09,417 --> 00:10:12,921
Hmm, hunger, love, bad smells--

268
00:10:13,005 --> 00:10:14,006
Mouse!

269
00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:15,549
What? What? Where?

270
00:10:15,632 --> 00:10:17,217
It ran right in front of me.

271
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,427
Oh, okay, well,
I think it's gone now, so...

272
00:10:19,511 --> 00:10:20,846
It's disgusting.

273
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:24,474
Oh, oh, you seem pretty shaken up.

274
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:26,060
Yeah.

275
00:10:26,143 --> 00:10:29,897
Do you--
You want to go get some boba tea?

276
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,606
Yeah, boba.

277
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,067
Okay. It's okay.

278
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,652
[shushes]

279
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:37,320
Hey.

280
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:38,739
What's up with black dudes
and their barbers?

281
00:10:38,822 --> 00:10:40,074
Why's it such a big deal?

282
00:10:40,157 --> 00:10:41,533
I could be a black barber.

283
00:10:41,616 --> 00:10:42,534
No, you couldn't.

284
00:10:42,617 --> 00:10:44,203
It's super hard.

285
00:10:44,285 --> 00:10:45,996
You can't fuck up the line
above their forehead.

286
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,039
It's got to be straight.

287
00:10:47,122 --> 00:10:48,289
Oh, what,
so I can't shave a straight line?

288
00:10:48,373 --> 00:10:50,000
Come on, of course I can do that.

289
00:10:50,084 --> 00:10:52,127
Oh, fuck, I think this dude
over here is jerking off.

290
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,339
Damn it.

291
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:58,926
Third masturbator I've seen this year.
Creepy dudes, man.

292
00:10:59,009 --> 00:10:59,968
We'll just go over to the other side.

293
00:11:00,052 --> 00:11:01,053
No, no, no, no, wait.

294
00:11:01,136 --> 00:11:02,679
We can't just keep
letting this shit slide.

295
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:04,056
We got to do something.

296
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:05,348
Well, I'm all for doing something,

297
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:07,101
but what would we do, exactly?

298
00:11:07,184 --> 00:11:08,393
What if we took a video of him

299
00:11:08,476 --> 00:11:10,187
and posted that shit all over Facebook?

300
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,521
He'd never be able to get a job again.

301
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:12,981
So we Internet shame him?

302
00:11:13,065 --> 00:11:14,399
I mean, in theory, it works.

303
00:11:14,482 --> 00:11:16,068
But it's kind of a long-term play.

304
00:11:16,151 --> 00:11:18,737
And who knows if the clip will go viral,
you know?

305
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,155
Maybe blogs will pick it up,

306
00:11:20,239 --> 00:11:21,489
maybe someone makes a meme, but--

307
00:11:21,573 --> 00:11:22,824
Okay, okay, okay, you right.

308
00:11:22,908 --> 00:11:24,659
Internet's too fickle.

309
00:11:24,743 --> 00:11:26,078
Oh, I got it.

310
00:11:26,161 --> 00:11:27,621
What if we make a citizen's arrest?

311
00:11:27,704 --> 00:11:28,997
What?

312
00:11:29,081 --> 00:11:30,207
You've heard that before, right?

313
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,583
"I'm making a citizen's arrest."

314
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,127
If you're a citizen,
you can arrest people.

315
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,461
Man, that shit ain't real.

316
00:11:34,544 --> 00:11:36,337
How we both know the phrase?

317
00:11:36,421 --> 00:11:37,631
Good point.

318
00:11:37,714 --> 00:11:39,007
But then what? What we gonna do?

319
00:11:39,091 --> 00:11:40,508
Ask the conductor to call the police?

320
00:11:40,592 --> 00:11:41,802
The conductor? There's no conductor.

321
00:11:41,885 --> 00:11:42,761
It's the G train.

322
00:11:42,844 --> 00:11:44,554
It's not fucking <i>Shining Time Station.</i>

323
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:46,014
Fine. We'll call the cops after.

324
00:11:46,098 --> 00:11:47,306
But we're gonna need evidence, though.

325
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,934
Okay.

326
00:11:49,017 --> 00:11:50,769
I'll act like I'm looking at a photo.

327
00:11:50,852 --> 00:11:52,771
Oh, yeah. Oh, hey, yeah.

328
00:11:52,854 --> 00:11:54,564
Look at that.
[chuckles]

They don't have to do that with the guys.

491
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,176
It's never like,
"Oh, are these men handsome enough?

492
00:17:56,259 --> 00:17:57,636
Uh, do they all have six-packs?"

493
00:17:57,718 --> 00:17:58,678
Never.

494
00:17:58,761 --> 00:18:00,472
They're, like, all frumpy bags of pudding.

495
00:18:00,555 --> 00:18:01,515
No offense.

496
00:18:01,598 --> 00:18:03,224
Yeah.

497
00:18:03,308 --> 00:18:05,226
The whole spot, you know,
it's these three guys

498
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,187
are having a barbecue,
and one of their wives

499
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,522
comes up with lemonade.

500
00:18:08,605 --> 00:18:10,565
Isn't that whole thing just antiquated?

501
00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:12,359
Yeah. All right.

502
00:18:12,442 --> 00:18:13,860
I got to hit the hay, brother.

503
00:18:13,943 --> 00:18:15,445
It's great chatting with you. All right.

504
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:16,737
See you, Brad!

505
00:18:21,742 --> 00:18:23,119
Uh, hey, man.

506
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:24,245
What's going on? Is my trailer moving?

507
00:18:24,329 --> 00:18:25,288
I'm playing Ted.

508
00:18:25,372 --> 00:18:27,123
Oh, man, I got some bad news.

509
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:28,667
They did a big rewrite this morning.

510
00:18:28,749 --> 00:18:30,335
Your part got nixed.

511
00:18:30,418 --> 00:18:33,171
Now it's three ladies having a barbecue.

512
00:18:33,254 --> 00:18:34,130
What?

513
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,343
Hey, man, you changed the whole spot?

514
00:18:38,426 --> 00:18:40,094
Oh, yeah.

515
00:18:40,178 --> 00:18:41,888
I'm so sorry, man.

516
00:18:41,971 --> 00:18:43,640
I thought about what
you were saying last night,

517
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:45,559
and I talked about it with the ad agency.

518
00:18:45,642 --> 00:18:48,811
And... we just decided
to go in this new direction.

519
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:50,104
Well, is there another direction

520
00:18:50,188 --> 00:18:52,399
where I don't get fired
and lose a bunch of money?

521
00:18:52,482 --> 00:18:55,818
Oh, man, I wish I didn't
have to let you go, brother.

522
00:18:55,902 --> 00:19:00,240
I did get you this vintage sheriff's badge

523
00:19:00,323 --> 00:19:03,326
as a sort of thank-you/I'm sorry gift.

524
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:06,037
You'll always be the sheriff on my set.

525
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,955
Well, I appreciate the sheriff's badge,

526
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:10,833
but is there anything I can do
in the commercial still?

527
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:12,877
I think I have an idea.

528
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,423
Oh, man, the sun is out,
and that means barbecues.

529
00:19:16,506 --> 00:19:18,633
At Garden Depot, they have the best deals

530
00:19:18,717 --> 00:19:20,051
on the biggest grills.

531
00:19:20,134 --> 00:19:22,512
It's summertime! Let's get cooking.

532
00:19:22,596 --> 00:19:24,805
Save up to 40% on our top grill brands

533
00:19:24,889 --> 00:19:26,099
all summer long.

534
00:19:26,182 --> 00:19:28,518
Get them while they're hot.

535
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:30,478
And rakes too!

536
00:19:30,562 --> 00:19:32,480
Oh, God, do we have smaller rakes?

537
00:19:32,564 --> 00:19:34,899
Because it looks like
we're selling giant rakes.

538
00:19:34,982 --> 00:19:36,984
Let-- Let's do another take, Dev.

539
00:19:37,068 --> 00:19:38,236
Sure.

540
00:19:39,862 --> 00:19:41,989
And action!

541
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:44,784
And rakes too.

542
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:47,412
Okay, I think we got it.

543
00:19:47,495 --> 00:19:48,829
Good job, man.

544
00:19:48,913 --> 00:19:49,997
Thanks.

545
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:52,709
Anush?

546
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:54,502
Hey, man, how's it going?

547
00:19:54,586 --> 00:19:56,045
Good, what're you doing here?

548
00:19:56,129 --> 00:19:57,297
I just booked a part in this commercial.

549
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,339
I'm the rake guy!

550
00:19:58,423 --> 00:19:59,633
[sighs]

551
00:19:59,716 --> 00:20:01,593
What? What's wrong?

552
00:20:01,676 --> 00:20:02,885
Hey, where you going?

553
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:04,596
Hey, are you in this commercial too?

554
00:20:06,723 --> 00:20:08,849
And rakes too.

555
00:20:08,933 --> 00:20:11,060
[sighs]
Goddamn, he's good.

556
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:12,771
I know, right?

557
00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:17,400
Hey, Dev.

558
00:20:17,484 --> 00:20:18,693
Hey, what's up, Diana?

559
00:20:18,777 --> 00:20:20,194
Um, we just all felt really bad

560
00:20:20,278 --> 00:20:21,821
about what happened to you.

561
00:20:21,904 --> 00:20:23,948
I mean, we loved having
more to do in the commercial,

562
00:20:24,031 --> 00:20:26,284
but it sucks that you couldn't
be in it at all.

563
00:20:26,367 --> 00:20:30,538
[Marie] So we got you this.

564
00:20:30,622 --> 00:20:31,748
[Dev] Whoa.

565
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:34,834
A guy jerking off on the subway,
on a cake.

566
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:37,003
Shout-out to the pastry team
at the grocery store

567
00:20:37,086 --> 00:20:38,630
for doing that design for you.

568
00:20:38,713 --> 00:20:40,923
Yeah, it was definitely uncomfortable.

569
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:43,009
I'm not really sure what
they think this cake is for.

570
00:20:43,092 --> 00:20:45,136
But anyway,
thanks for saying what you said to Brad

571
00:20:45,219 --> 00:20:46,721
about the commercial.

572
00:20:46,805 --> 00:20:48,014
It's just really nice
that you tried to see it

573
00:20:48,097 --> 00:20:49,641
from our perspective.

574
00:20:49,724 --> 00:20:52,644
Also, the cake is 100% gluten-free.

575
00:20:52,727 --> 00:20:54,521
Do you know what gluten does to you?

576
00:20:54,604 --> 00:20:56,439
Lupus. Gluten gives you lupus.

577
00:20:56,523 --> 00:20:57,774
Okay, Marie.

578
00:20:59,066 --> 00:21:00,193
So you got fired.

579
00:21:00,276 --> 00:21:01,944
At least you still got
to attend the wrap party.

580
00:21:02,028 --> 00:21:03,571
Yes, great consolation.

581
00:21:03,655 --> 00:21:06,366
Cash bar and bad nachos.

582
00:21:06,449 --> 00:21:08,368
I'm never buying one of those grills.

583
00:21:08,451 --> 00:21:10,411
Actually,
I'm gonna buy a bunch of those grills,

584
00:21:10,495 --> 00:21:11,954
deplete their stock,

585
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:13,414
then return them at the end of the summer.

586
00:21:13,498 --> 00:21:14,499
Boom!

587
00:21:14,582 --> 00:21:15,792
Thanks, buddy.

588
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,627
Might be a little unnecessary, though.

589
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:19,920
To me not getting fired at my next gig!

590
00:21:20,004 --> 00:21:21,756
[glasses clink]

591
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,759
Hey, man,
I'm so sorry that things didn't work out,

592
00:21:24,843 --> 00:21:27,470
but your idea came out really great.

593
00:21:27,554 --> 00:21:28,555
Aw, thanks, man.

594
00:21:28,638 --> 00:21:29,556
Yeah.

595
00:21:29,639 --> 00:21:30,890
Hey, hey.

596
00:21:30,973 --> 00:21:33,184
Brad Honeycutt, Brad Honeycutt, okay.

597
00:21:33,267 --> 00:21:34,853
Yeah. I'm really sorry again.

598
00:21:34,935 --> 00:21:37,397
Hey, Brad Honeycutt, okay.

599
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,190
So there's a thing.

600
00:21:39,273 --> 00:21:40,274
What?

601
00:21:40,358 --> 00:21:41,860
You didn't notice that?

602
00:21:41,942 --> 00:21:43,653
That guy only introduced
himself to the men at the table.

603
00:21:43,737 --> 00:21:46,280
He went right past us, like
Denise and I were invisible.

604
00:21:46,364 --> 00:21:48,115
Yeah, he totally snubbed us.

605
00:21:48,199 --> 00:21:49,492
I don't know,
I don't think that was intentional.

606
00:21:49,576 --> 00:21:50,702
You guys were sitting in the corner.

607
00:21:50,785 --> 00:21:51,952
He was probably just in a rush.

608
00:21:52,036 --> 00:21:53,747
Yeah, well, in his rush,
he managed to shake hands

609
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,331
with two random dudes and Arnold.

610
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:56,708
He didn't think we were important enough.

611
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:57,834
I don't know.

612
00:21:57,917 --> 00:22:00,127
Seems like you might be
reading a bit much into it.

613
00:22:00,211 --> 00:22:01,629
We're telling you that this is something

614
00:22:01,713 --> 00:22:03,339
that definitely happens to women
all the time.

615
00:22:03,423 --> 00:22:05,049
But fine,
deny our perception of the world.

616
00:22:05,132 --> 00:22:06,634
Here's my issue.

617
00:22:06,718 --> 00:22:09,095
He just went to the bathroom,
washed his hands, they're still wet.

618
00:22:09,178 --> 00:22:10,638
I don't want to shake no wet hands.

619
00:22:10,722 --> 00:22:13,850
Now I got to wash my hands. BRB.

620
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:15,435
Man, I hate this shit.

621
00:22:15,518 --> 00:22:16,936
I'm gonna get a shot of Sprite.

622
00:22:18,646 --> 00:22:19,939
[sighs]

623
00:22:20,022 --> 00:22:21,441
Are you really mad at me right now?

624
00:22:21,524 --> 00:22:22,859
Kind of.

625
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:24,110
Not that mad, though, right?

626
00:22:24,193 --> 00:22:25,278
Hey!

627
00:22:25,361 --> 00:22:26,738
What? Why are you mad at me?

628
00:22:26,821 --> 00:22:28,656
Your beef's with Brad Honeycutt.

629
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,701
Do you really think that guy
has something against women

630
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:33,828
'cause he didn't shake
you and Denise's hands?

631
00:22:33,912 --> 00:22:36,122
You're not listening to what
I'm trying to say at all.

632
00:22:36,205 --> 00:22:37,832
All right, whatever.

633
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:39,918
I'm sorry you missed out
on the life-changing experience

634
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,586
of shaking hands with Brad Honeycutt.

635
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:42,921
What a tragedy.

636
00:22:43,003 --> 00:22:44,963
I'm gonna go get a drink.

637
00:22:45,047 --> 00:22:46,841
Rachel!

638
00:22:58,728 --> 00:23:00,939
So I was thinking about the whole

639
00:23:01,021 --> 00:23:02,690
Brad Honeycutt situation.

640
00:23:02,774 --> 00:23:06,402
And, um, there's a chance that what he did

641
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:08,279
may have been a little sexist.

642
00:23:08,362 --> 00:23:10,824
Great, cool apology.

643
00:23:10,907 --> 00:23:12,826
Look, I'm just saying I'm sorry

644
00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:14,410
I defended Brad Honeycutt.

645
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:15,994
Can you at least give me that I'm not some

646
00:23:16,078 --> 00:23:17,956
sort of sexist monster for thinking that

647
00:23:18,038 --> 00:23:22,084
maybe he wasn't motivated
by a crazy sexist agenda

648
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:24,253
when he didn't introduce
himself to you guys?

649
00:23:24,337 --> 00:23:26,965
I'm not saying
that you're a sexist monster.

650
00:23:27,047 --> 00:23:29,258
I just think it's weird
that your first instinct

651
00:23:29,342 --> 00:23:32,219
is to act like I'm crazy
and defend Brad Honeycutt

652
00:23:32,303 --> 00:23:34,639
instead of just believing me.

653
00:23:34,722 --> 00:23:36,349
Well, I guess,
in my head, I'd like to think

654
00:23:36,432 --> 00:23:38,309
someone isn't so awful that they wouldn't

655
00:23:38,392 --> 00:23:40,937
introduce themselves to someone
just 'cause they're a woman.

656
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,396
And what I'm saying
is that there are a lot

657
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,315
of subtle little things that happen to me

658
00:23:44,398 --> 00:23:48,194
and all women,
even in our little progressive world.

659
00:23:48,277 --> 00:23:50,822
And when somebody,
especially my boyfriend,

660
00:23:50,905 --> 00:23:53,700
tells me I'm wrong without
having any way of knowing

661
00:23:53,783 --> 00:23:56,494
my personal experience, it's insulting.

662
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,998
Okay. I get that.

663
00:24:00,122 --> 00:24:01,916
Well, I mean, I guess there's no way

664
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,041
I'll ever really know what it's like

665
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:05,294
to be in your shoes, so...

666
00:24:05,378 --> 00:24:08,548
I'll try to do a better job of listening,
all right?

667
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,759
So can we call it a draw?

668
00:24:11,843 --> 00:24:13,469
Nope. I won.

669
00:24:13,553 --> 00:24:15,722
- Hey!
- I won!

670
00:24:15,805 --> 00:24:18,056
Hello, everybody, I won!

671
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:21,268
I had a fight with my boyfriend,
and I just won that fight!

672
00:24:21,352 --> 00:24:23,229
[Dev] No, we came to an understanding

673
00:24:23,312 --> 00:24:24,814
after a thoughtful discussion.

674
00:24:24,898 --> 00:24:25,815
[Rachel] I won!
