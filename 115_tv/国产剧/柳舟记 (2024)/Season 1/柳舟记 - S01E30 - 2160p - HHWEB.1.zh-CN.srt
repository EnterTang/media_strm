1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,400
Ahhh!

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,967
After 10,000 years, I'm free!

3
00:00:07,967 --> 00:00:11,700
Its time to conquer earth!

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,200
Alpha, Rita's escaped!

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,167
Recruit a team of
teenagers with attitude!

6
00:00:22,533 --> 00:00:25,900
# Go, go, Power Rangers #

7
00:00:27,967 --> 00:00:31,333
# Go, go, Power Rangers #

8
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,833
# Go, go, Power Rangers #

9
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:39,600
# Mighty Morphin Power Rangers #

10
00:00:46,767 --> 00:00:48,933
# Power Rangers #

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,867
# Power Rangers #

12
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,733
# Go, go, Power Rangers #

13
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:01,533
# You Mighty Morphin
Power Rangers #

14
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,933
This is going to be fun.

15
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:06,367
You're going to have a good time.

16
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:08,867
Wish you were coming with us.

17
00:01:08,867 --> 00:01:10,867
Yeah, there's plenty of room.

18
00:01:10,867 --> 00:01:12,900
Well, barely.

19
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,900
Thanks, but I want
to spend some time

20
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,367
With my Cousin Jeremy
 while he's in town.

21
00:01:18,367 --> 00:01:20,767
Won't be the same without you.

22
00:01:20,767 --> 00:01:22,767
Sorry I'm late, guys.

23
00:01:22,767 --> 00:01:26,267
I baked these in
my gourmet cooking class

24
00:01:26,267 --> 00:01:28,267
to take along on our trip.

25
00:01:30,267 --> 00:01:32,933
Ugh. What is in these?

26
00:01:32,933 --> 00:01:34,433
TRINI:
It's an exotic recipe.

27
00:01:34,933 --> 00:01:36,933
Very popular in France right now.

28
00:01:36,933 --> 00:01:39,200
They call it Torte A La Escargot.

29
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,567
Escargot?

30
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:41,567
Tasty.

31
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:43,667
In other words, snail.

32
00:01:44,167 --> 00:01:45,933
( coughing )

33
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:52,733
Ah...
all ready to take on our trip.

34
00:01:52,733 --> 00:01:54,133
Come on, guys.

35
00:01:57,133 --> 00:01:59,133
Oh, goody,
they're going away.

36
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:02,833
This is just what her nastiness
has been waiting for.

37
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:06,600
So what's the plan,
your Evilness?

38
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,667
To find the Mirror of Destruction.

39
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:11,400
The one that can
destroy Super Putties?

40
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,000
Yes, into a million pieces.

41
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,500
That mirror's power

42
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,500
will destroy anything
reflected in it.

43
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,000
Just one look at it

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and those Rangers are history.

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,500
We have to find it first.

46
00:02:23,167 --> 00:02:24,167
We'll start today.

47
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:26,167
It's hidden on Earth.

48
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:28,167
( mumbling )

49
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:33,167
# Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum #

50
00:02:33,167 --> 00:02:34,667
You see, Skull

51
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:37,667
the beauty of
the Sloppy Joe Pizza

52
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:40,667
is that you can
make a huge funnel

53
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:44,667
and thereby jam more
pizza down your throat.

54
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:46,667
( bubbling sound )

55
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,167
# Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum #

56
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:50,667
Oh, look.

57
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:53,667
It's Jason Schmason.

58
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:55,600
( laughing )

59
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,900
Hey, Jase.
Who's the pipsqueak?

60
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,700
Isn't this the famous bully
you were talking about?

61
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,367
Hey, Bulk, you're famous.

62
00:03:04,367 --> 00:03:05,367
JASON:
Hey, Bulk.

63
00:03:05,867 --> 00:03:06,867
Nice shirt.

64
00:03:06,867 --> 00:03:10,167
Does that come with extra cheese?

65
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:15,667
You know...

66
00:03:16,167 --> 00:03:18,100
I don't like your attitude.

67
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,500
Come on.

68
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,500
I think it's time

69
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,967
for me to teach you
a little lesson.

70
00:03:25,467 --> 00:03:27,567
( martial arts cries )

71
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:35,100
Jase, watch out for that.

72
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,800
Gee, Bulk. That look is you.

73
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:49,800
That was awesome

74
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,800
how you tricked him
into beating himself.

75
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,300
Just remember that 
it's brains before brawn.

76
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,300
Right, brains before brawn.

77
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:02,967
You're getting better.

78
00:04:02,967 --> 00:04:04,967
The cool thing about Martial Arts

79
00:04:05,467 --> 00:04:08,033
is it teaches you self-discipline
and confidence.

80
00:04:08,033 --> 00:04:10,100
Hey, Jase,
teach me a cool move.

81
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,100
Okay.

82
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,100
Back leg, front kick.

83
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,600
Good. All right. All right.

84
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,100
Now, this one's a little harder

85
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,333
but I want you to try it.

86
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,500
Okay. All right.

87
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,433
Now, try it again, but focus.

88
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,733
Hey, I did it.

89
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:40,233
When I was your age,
I was really insecure

90
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:42,533
but Martial Arts
built my self-confidence.

91
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,500
Wow!
Now you're the coolest.

92
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,233
All you have to do is practice.

93
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:50,267
I hope I can be as cool
as the Power Rangers.

94
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:51,567
Power Rangers?

95
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:54,567
Yeah. That's what I want
to be when I grow up.

96
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:56,200
All right.

97
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,767
RITA:
What's Jason doing there?

98
00:05:04,267 --> 00:05:05,233
SQUATT:
Martial Arts?

99
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:09,733
He's there after you said
the Rangers were gone.

100
00:05:10,233 --> 00:05:12,233
Finding the mirror
will have to wait

101
00:05:12,233 --> 00:05:13,933
till my Putties take care of him

102
00:05:13,933 --> 00:05:15,533
and that will happen

103
00:05:15,533 --> 00:05:16,533
right now!

104
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:24,033
Putties.

105
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:27,033
Oh, man.
What are we going to do?

106
00:05:27,033 --> 00:05:28,533
Stay behind me.

107
00:05:29,033 --> 00:05:30,533
Watch your back.

108
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:32,433
Stay back!

109
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,700
Good job, Jeremy.

110
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,700
Wow! I'd always heard
about Rita and the Putties

111
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,700
but I never thought
I'd actually see them.

112
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,700
Let's hope you don't
see them again.

113
00:06:21,633 --> 00:06:23,567
Hey, hey, I got something.

114
00:06:29,433 --> 00:06:30,633
A bottle.

115
00:06:30,633 --> 00:06:32,067
Weird!

116
00:06:32,067 --> 00:06:33,333
I wonder what's inside.

117
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,267
Looks like a map.

118
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:35,433
Open it.

119
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,200
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

120
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,700
What's going on?

121
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,200
Get down! Get down!

122
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,200
Wait here!

123
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,200
( rumbling )

124
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,600
Coast is clear.

125
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,600
Zordon, come in.

126
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,633
Jason, my sensors
are picking up

127
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:02,133
something unusual
in the Morphing Grid.

128
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,200
Take Jeremy to a safe place.

129
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,200
Right.

130
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,700
TRINI: Oh, my gosh.
It's an earthquake.

131
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,700
BILLY:
Everybody hold on.

132
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,200
Jeremy, are you okay?

133
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,700
Okay?

134
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,700
Man, this is totally cool.

135
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,800
What a way to start a vacation.

136
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,467
And check out this map.

137
00:07:26,467 --> 00:07:28,967
RITA: It leads to the
Mirror of Destruction.

138
00:07:29,467 --> 00:07:30,467
( laughing )

139
00:07:30,467 --> 00:07:31,733
And once I've got
my hands on it

140
00:07:31,733 --> 00:07:35,000
you'll suffer the same
fate as all the others.

141
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,067
It will zap them so hard,
they won't know what hit them.

142
00:07:39,067 --> 00:07:40,533
We need that map.

143
00:07:40,533 --> 00:07:42,900
Right.
Go and get it, Scorpina.

144
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,400
Yeah.

145
00:07:49,733 --> 00:07:51,433
( chuckling )

146
00:07:51,433 --> 00:07:53,433
SCORPINA:
Over there.

147
00:07:58,767 --> 00:08:03,000
SCORPINA: The Rockstar
will take care of him in no time.

148
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,433
Get the map from the kid.

149
00:08:05,933 --> 00:08:06,933
Jeremy, run!

150
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:09,433
- But...
- I'll find you later.

151
00:08:09,433 --> 00:08:12,000
Don't let anything
happen to that map.

152
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Gotcha!

153
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,267
Jason, now you'll get
what's coming to you.

154
00:08:16,267 --> 00:08:17,367
Attack!

155
00:08:17,867 --> 00:08:19,367
Now, Rockstar!

156
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:21,533
( roaring )

157
00:08:25,867 --> 00:08:29,367
You won't get away
with this, Scorpina!

158
00:08:30,367 --> 00:08:34,733
That Rockstar is
one tough monster.

159
00:08:34,733 --> 00:08:38,267
Jason doesn't stand a chance
pinned down like that.

160
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,267
He's a sitting duck.

161
00:08:39,267 --> 00:08:40,767
What will we do?

162
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:43,267
Alpha, we must contact
the other Power Rangers.

163
00:08:43,267 --> 00:08:45,767
They are the only ones
who can save him.

164
00:08:45,767 --> 00:08:47,767
( beeping )
Zordon, I read you.

165
00:08:47,767 --> 00:08:50,267
Teleport to the beach
immediately.

166
00:08:50,267 --> 00:08:51,767
We're on our way.

167
00:08:57,133 --> 00:08:58,633
Here!

168
00:08:58,633 --> 00:09:00,633
Jason!

169
00:09:00,633 --> 00:09:02,633
Don't worry, Jason.

170
00:09:02,633 --> 00:09:04,633
We'll free you.

171
00:09:04,633 --> 00:09:06,133
Are you all right?

172
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:08,133
( grunting )

173
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:11,133
Thanks.

174
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,633
That was a close one.

175
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:14,633
We got to find Jeremy.

176
00:09:15,133 --> 00:09:18,133
He's got the map that
Scorpina's looking for.

177
00:09:18,133 --> 00:09:19,633
Let's go.

178
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,100
Where's Jason?

179
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,100
I hope he's okay.

180
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,100
- JASON: Jeremy!
- KIMBERLY: Jeremy!

181
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,333
- BILLY: Jeremy!
- ZACK: Jeremy!

182
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,333
Jeremy!

183
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,333
( beeping )

184
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,400
Zordon, we read you.

185
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,033
You must fight Scorpina
and her Rockstar monster

186
00:09:42,033 --> 00:09:43,033
at the beach club.

187
00:09:43,533 --> 00:09:44,533
What about Jeremy?

188
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:46,033
Don't worry, Jason.

189
00:09:46,533 --> 00:09:47,033
I'll find him.

190
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:49,033
You must go immediately.

191
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:51,133
It's Morphin Time!

192
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:52,633
Mastodon!

193
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:53,633
Pterodactyl!

194
00:09:53,633 --> 00:09:54,633
Triceratops!

195
00:09:54,633 --> 00:09:55,633
Sabretooth Tiger!

196
00:09:56,133 --> 00:09:57,367
Tyrannosaurus!

197
00:09:58,367 --> 00:10:00,033
All right! Let's do it!

198
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,400
ALL:
Power Rangers!

199
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,067
Attack!

200
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,600
( grunts and groans )

201
00:10:29,167 --> 00:10:31,667
Zack, are you all right?

202
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:32,667
I'm fine.

203
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:35,167
Not for long, Power Rangers.

204
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:36,667
You lose.

205
00:10:37,133 --> 00:10:38,467
I win.

206
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:41,167
( groaning )

207
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:42,567
( evil laughter )

208
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,267
( groans )

209
00:10:49,767 --> 00:10:50,767
( evil laughter )

210
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,100
Scorpina, you've got to find

211
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,600
that kid with the map.

212
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,600
Hurry and finish them!

213
00:11:05,467 --> 00:11:07,833
( growling )

214
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:08,833
Hey, you guys okay?

215
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:09,833
Yeah.

216
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,333
Get us out!

217
00:11:13,867 --> 00:11:16,200
( panting )

218
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,867
Attack!

219
00:11:29,867 --> 00:11:31,600
Here they are.
Get them!

220
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,100
( yelling )

221
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,700
- Ooh, yeah.
- Uh, see ya.

222
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:41,400
( evil laughter )

223
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,800
( evil laughter )

224
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:11,433
Yes!

225
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:13,433
Brains before brawn.

226
00:12:15,433 --> 00:12:16,933
Let me see.

227
00:12:17,433 --> 00:12:19,933
This is where I am now.

228
00:12:19,933 --> 00:12:22,933
It says I should take
six giant steps forward.

229
00:12:23,933 --> 00:12:25,567
Should I finish them off,

230
00:12:26,067 --> 00:12:27,167
Scorpina?

231
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:28,533
- A good idea.
- Right!

232
00:12:29,033 --> 00:12:31,167
- What are you waiting for?
- Yeah!

233
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:32,967
( both groaning )

234
00:12:33,467 --> 00:12:35,567
( yelling )

235
00:12:36,067 --> 00:12:37,067
( evil laughter )

236
00:12:40,267 --> 00:12:42,267
Wow! This must be it.

237
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:53,667
Huh?

238
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,333
Whoa!

239
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,500
Huh? No!

240
00:13:25,033 --> 00:13:26,533
Cool.

241
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,567
Uh-oh.

242
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:30,433
( grunting )

243
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:31,833
Yikes!

244
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,700
( anguished cry )

245
00:13:39,033 --> 00:13:40,833
This is too hot to handle.

246
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:51,367
Okay, you've had it.

247
00:13:51,367 --> 00:13:52,767
- ( grunting )
- Come on.

248
00:14:06,633 --> 00:14:08,733
Hey, look what I found.

249
00:14:12,267 --> 00:14:14,200
Yeah, now I've got it.

250
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,633
Let's finally get rid of
those Power Rangers.

251
00:14:17,133 --> 00:14:19,700
Now, Scorpina, grow!

252
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,367
( evil laughter )

253
00:14:30,567 --> 00:14:31,567
( growling )

254
00:14:31,567 --> 00:14:33,333
Now you're mine.

255
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:36,100
We need Dinozord Power!

256
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,700
ALL:
Now!

257
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,167
( roaring )

258
00:14:56,133 --> 00:14:57,133
Let's do it!

259
00:14:57,633 --> 00:14:58,833
( all yelling )

260
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:03,600
Way cool.
Power Rangers to the rescue.

261
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,767
Power up the Megazord.

262
00:15:05,767 --> 00:15:06,700
( roaring )

263
00:15:07,867 --> 00:15:09,367
( roaring )

264
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:20,067
All systems are go.

265
00:15:20,067 --> 00:15:21,033
Let's do it!

266
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,000
ALL:
Right!

267
00:15:22,733 --> 00:15:24,233
- Morphin.
- Morphin.

268
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,433
Megazord Battle Mode now!

269
00:15:28,933 --> 00:15:31,900
Megazord Sequence
has been initiated.

270
00:15:45,967 --> 00:15:48,567
Megazord activated.

271
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:52,200
( growling )

272
00:15:54,767 --> 00:15:56,833
( high-pitched hum )

273
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,833
Hide your eyes!

274
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,333
( grunting )

275
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,300
( growling )

276
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,767
Yoo-hoo!

277
00:16:10,767 --> 00:16:12,300
Over here.

278
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,300
Sucker! ( growling )

279
00:16:19,233 --> 00:16:20,733
We can't break lose!

280
00:16:20,733 --> 00:16:23,533
Nothing can save you now.

281
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,867
Behold,
the Mirror of Destruction!

282
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,033
Don't move.

283
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,033
Here's our chance!

284
00:16:34,033 --> 00:16:35,700
Powerzord!

285
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:50,900
- Yeah!
- All right!

286
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,900
You'll pay for this,
Power Rangers.

287
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,667
Count on it.

288
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:02,167
ZORDON:
Another job well done, Rangers.

289
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:03,333
Thanks, Zordon.

290
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,833
( beeping )

291
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,100
Wow,
you guys were awesome.

292
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,100
You were pretty brave yourself.

293
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,600
We're real proud of you--

294
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,000
how you kept outsmarting
those Putties.

295
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,500
You know what they say--

296
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:16,433
brains before brawn.

297
00:17:16,433 --> 00:17:17,833
An exemplary motto.

298
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:21,333
I can't believe I finally
got to meet you guys.

299
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,333
I can't wait till
I tell my Cousin Jason.

300
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,367
By the way, where is Jason?

301
00:17:25,867 --> 00:17:26,867
I hope he's okay.

302
00:17:26,867 --> 00:17:28,367
- Uh...     - Yeah...
- Yeah...

303
00:17:29,367 --> 00:17:29,867
I'm sure he's just fine.

304
00:17:33,867 --> 00:17:36,367
...and then I kicked
the Putty like this.

305
00:17:36,367 --> 00:17:38,367
But then, just when
he was about to nail me,

306
00:17:38,367 --> 00:17:40,600
this magical mirror blew him up

307
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,900
into a zillion pieces.
Bang!

308
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,100
To think we were stuck
at that boring field trip.

309
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,100
But the Power Rangers--
they were the coolest.

310
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,333
Man,
you should have been them.

311
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,467
Oh, you've met
the Power Rangers?

312
00:17:54,467 --> 00:17:55,967
Sure did. There was also

313
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:59,167
the scorpion lady
called the Rockstar.

314
00:17:59,167 --> 00:18:00,567
Idiosyncratic.

315
00:18:01,067 --> 00:18:03,733
He spit out these rocks
as big as a house.

316
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:05,300
- Really?
- Really.

317
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,300
Yeah,
and he hit the yellow one.

318
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,567
The black one
kicked him into the pool.

319
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:10,567
And then later

320
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:13,067
the pink one flew through the air

321
00:18:13,067 --> 00:18:14,567
with her bow and arrow.

322
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:16,067
She was just awesome.

323
00:18:16,567 --> 00:18:18,067
Tell us more about
the black one.

324
00:18:18,067 --> 00:18:20,067
And the scorpion lady

325
00:18:20,067 --> 00:18:21,567
turned into this huge monster

326
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:24,900
and the Power Rangers
jumped into this huge robot.

327
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:25,900
- Wow.
- Wow.

328
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,367
Sounds like you had
a pretty wild time.

329
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:29,833
I got to go.

330
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,033
You should have seen
the red one

331
00:18:32,533 --> 00:18:34,300
battle it out with
the scorpion lady.

332
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,800
- He was the greatest.
- Yeah?

333
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,567
Continue.

334
00:18:39,067 --> 00:18:40,867
He did the coolest
flying spin kick.

335
00:18:40,867 --> 00:18:42,533
( yelling )

336
00:18:43,033 --> 00:18:45,300
Hey, Jase

337
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,433
I meant to ask you.

338
00:18:46,933 --> 00:18:48,067
Where were you

339
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:49,167
