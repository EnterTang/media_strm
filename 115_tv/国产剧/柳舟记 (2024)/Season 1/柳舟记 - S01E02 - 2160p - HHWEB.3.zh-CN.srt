如果他们从屏幕上消失了

他们就会从此逃脱了

You're well-spoken for an O.P.A. soldier.

132
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,230
因为我来自小行星 就是外行星联盟的吗
Because I'm a Belter, I'm naturally O.P.A.?

133
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,840
我只是个小行星上的普通居民

你是指地球和火星之间的平衡
You mean the balance between Earth and Mars.

141
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,630
无论怎样 都不会对小行星带人有什么好处
Either way, it's a lousy deal for Belters.

142
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,550
外行星联盟通过暴力来表达诉求
The O.P.A. demands legitimacy through violence.

143
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,630
他们没选择过其他方法
They haven't earned it any other way.

144
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:16,140
是吗 你现在隔着块玻璃跟我说话
No? You talk to me through a piece of glass,

145
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,520
你看我的身体 已经无法
you see my body which can no longer survive

146
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,190
在这个孕育过我曾祖母的星球上存活
on the very planet that bore my great-grandmother.

147
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:27,270
地球在太空中造就了一群流亡者
Earth has created a race of exiles out in space,

148
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,260
他们无家可归
who have no homes to return to.

149
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,780
这个问题只能被无视吗
Should this go unanswered?

150
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,970
我并不想让你害怕 夫人
I don't mean to make you afraid, madame.

151
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,950
我让你觉得我害怕了吗
Have I given you the impression that I'm afraid?

152
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:44,690
那为什么要在我这个小信使身上浪费时间
Then why waste your time on a meaningless courier like myself?

153
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,740
你太谦虚了 孩子
You're too modest, child.

154
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:50,940
有人委托你运送圣杯的一些碎片
Someone entrusted you to transport pieces of the Holy Grail.

155
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,670
问题是 谁委托的你
The question is, who?

156
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,670
有很多比这里更难过的地方
There are places far worse than this.

157
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:06,220
我想在某个地方有一位母亲
And I imagine there is a mother somewhere

158
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,440
很想再见到她的儿子
who'll love to see her boy again.

159
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,110
是这样的 夫人
Est cela ?a, madame.

160
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,240
我理解
I understand.

161
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,320
我们都有我们的责任
We all have our duty.

162
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,960
穿梭舰_骑士号
小行星带

163
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:32,680
我们的无线电坏了 氧气大概还够用四小时
We've got a dead radio and about four hours of oxygen left.

164
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,520
亚历克斯 我们的燃料还有多少
Alex, how much burn do we have?

165
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,300
我大概能开到距离木卫三空间站
I could get us maybe a third of the way

166
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,130
还差三分之二的地方 或许
to Ganymede Station, maybe.

167
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:40,360
或者直接飞到运输航路边上
Or get us right to the edge of the shipping lanes,

168
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,550
然后就只能祈祷有人能碰到我们了
and then we'd have to pray someone tripped over us.

169
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:44,790
不可能的
It won't happen.

170
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,540
没有应答机 我们跟太空垃圾没什么区别
With a dead transponder, we're just like space trash.

171
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,710
无线电出什么问题了
What's wrong with the radio?

172
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,440
主板烧了 而且我猜
Board's cooked, and I'm guessing

173
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,840
外面的天线也完了
the antenna array up top has seen better days.

174
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,920
看看能不能做一块板子出来
See if you can improvise another board.

175
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,590
我出去看看到底是怎么样了
I'm gonna go outside and see what's what.

176
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,800
太好了 我们在里面等你
Great. We'll wait here.

177
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,800
我不想总说坏消息 但是
I don't mean to be a bad news bull or anything, but

178
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:05,800
气闸坏了
the airlock's done.

179
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,870
外面的门也没了
The outer door's gone.

180
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,080
我们得给船体排气
Then we'll have to vent the ship.

181
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,750
你疯了吗
Are you outta your tree?

182
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,060
我们会失去舱内所有的氧气
We'll lose all oxygen in the cabin.

183
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,370
一切希望都在修好无线电上
Everything depends on fixing that radio.

184
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,110
我们在浪费时间
We're wasting time.

185
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:24,020
又来了 你又在自己做决定
There you go. Calling the shots again.

186
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,050
我要出去 你有意见吗
I'm going outside. You got a problem with that?

187
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,090
艾莫斯 和他一起去
Amos, go with him.

188
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,550
大家先等等
Let's just hold on for one second.

189
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,770
我们没必要去外面
We don't have to go outside.

190
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,620
我们现在很安全
We're safe right now.

191
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,550
把闸门打开 我们就完了
We open those doors, we're done.

192
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,460
船体可能会四分五裂 我告诉你
The ship could crack apart. I'm telling you...

193
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,250
-谢德 -我只是 如果我们打开闸门
- Shed? - I'm just... If we open those doors...

194
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,780
听我说 听我说好吗
Please, just listen to me. Listen to me!

195
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,210
如果我们出去了 我们会死的
If we out there, we're gonna die.

196
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,190
你要休克了 你要休克了
You're in shock. You're in shock.

197
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:51,310
你知道会有什么症状
You know the symptoms.

198
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:54,020
你知道会有什么症状的 呼吸 呼吸
You know the symptoms. Just breathe. Breathe.

199
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:57,540
深呼吸 呼吸 呼吸
Deep... breathe. Breathe, breathe.

200
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,590
好了
All right.

201
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,190
就是这样
There.

202
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,590
就像这样 冷静下来了吗
There. You chilled?

203
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:08,720
好了
Okay.

204
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,420
现在 我们要出去
Now, we're gonna go outside,

205
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,480
去修好那个天线
and we're gonna fix the antenna,

206
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,560
然后弄出点声音来 我们就能获救了
and we're gonna make some noise and get rescued.

207
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:17,930
-好的 -好吗
- Okay. - Okay?

208
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,420
好
Yeah.

209
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,040
注意脚下 伙计们 快到了
Watch your step, boys. We're on the way.

210
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,930
外面情况怎么样
How's it looking out there?

211
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,480
不会更糟了
Well, it couldn't been worse.

212
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,190
总是有更坏的可能
It can always be worse.

213
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,630
好吧 确实更糟
Okay. It's worse.

214
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,820
你不在附近队长很生气
Captain was pissed you weren't around.

215
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,740
她要你处理好这事
She wanted this dealt with.

216
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,360
是啊 这周我真是走运
Yeah, it must be my week.

217
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,280
新的地球搭档
New Earth partner.

218
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,190
吸引了所有"烫手"的案子
Drawing all the "Hot" cases...

219
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,320
请大家注意 空气 水和电
Your attention, please. The Air, water and power...

220
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,060
到时间了
Well, it's about time.

221
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,590
一个小时前你就该到了
Expected you an hour ago.

222
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,950
从麦迪纳过来还挺远的 长官
It's a long hoof from the Medina, sir.

223
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,850
一个星期前
A week ago,

224
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,950
开始出现那种枯萎的绿地
those dead patches started appearing.

225
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,040
我的猜测是格雷加斯的人又在偷水了
My guess is, the Greigas are stealing water again.

226
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,990
有些小行星带人显然不尊重
Some Belters clearly don't respect

227
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:24,290
绿地在空气和水循环中的重要作用
the green space's role in recycling the air and the water.

228
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:28,210
更别说这种现象会让总督蒙羞了
Not to mention the embarrassment it causes the Governor.

229
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,920
你似乎很确信是小行星带人干的
You seem sure it was Belters.

230
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,900
这的罪犯一般都是他们
The criminals here tend to be.

231
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,360
你是新来的 对吗
You're new here, aren't you?

232
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,030
我们会处理好的 长官
We'll get right on that, sir.

233
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,220
如果谷神星上所有人都能看到这番景致
Maybe if everyone in Ceres had this view,

234
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,560
他们会更尊重你
they'd respect you more.

235
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,990
给你
There.

236
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,200
现在你可以创造自己的风景了
Now, you can make your own view.

237
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,070
该死
Oh, shit!

238
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,240
你是地球人
You're an Earther.

239
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,860
但我都不知道你来自哪里
And I don't even know where you're from.

240
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:44,210
再过几个小时 我们就成太空垃圾了
We're gonna be space trash in a few hours

241
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,430
你这会才想套近乎吗
and you wanna start a friendship?

242
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,770
你要是觉得我们成不了
If you don't think we're gonna make it,

243
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,260
那你出来干嘛
what are you doing up here?

244
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,950
奈奥米让我出来 我就出来了
Naomi told me to, so I am.

245
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,280
就我看来 她现在是船长
As far as I'm concerned, she's the cap now.

246
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,570
直到弄丢我的小克莱门汀
Till I lost my Clementine

247
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:30,150
亚历克斯 给E-12送点燃料
Alex, send me some juice to E-12.

248
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,870
-我多想念她 -亚历克斯
- How I missed her... - Alex?

249
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,190
亚历克斯
Alex!

250
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,960
E-12
E-12.

251
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,440
收到
Copy that.

252
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,230
好了 甜心
There you go, sugar.

253
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,700
你没事吧
You doin' okay up there?

254
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,140
我好得就像阳光明媚的
I'm doing as good as dew on

255
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:50,130
清晨里的一颗露珠
a mornin' full of sunshine.

256
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,330
你和奈奥米是怎么回事
Hey, what's the deal with you and Naomi?

257
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,700
你俩是一对吗
You two an item or something?

258
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,510
一对
An item?

259
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,710
这不关我的事 不过...
Hey, it's none of my business, but...

260
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,630
你一定以为我挺傻的吧
You must think I'm pretty stupid, don't you?

261
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,860
没错
I mean, you're right.

262
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,890
我闭着眼都可以
I can take a core apart

263
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,910
把飞船核心拆散再装回去
and put it back together with my eyes closed.

264
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,150
可要问我应不应该
But ask me whether or not I should

265
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:28,120
扯下你的头盔 把你踢走
rip your helmet off and kick you off this bucket,

266
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:32,830
我竟然想不出一个该或是不该的理由
and I couldn't give you a reason why I should or shouldn't.

267
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,430
我只知道奈奥米不会喜欢
Except Naomi wouldn't like it.

268
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,790
可以把钻头给我吗
Could you pass me the drill?

269
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,020
谢谢
Thank you.

270
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,730
我丢了我的小克莱门汀
Then I lost my Clementine

271
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,660
亚历克斯 你在干什么
Alex, what are you doing?

272
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,110
我在带她回家 小圆派
I'm bringin' her home, honey-pie.

273
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,970
一步 两步 我们就能在一起了
One more, two... And we'll be together.

274
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,350
就再去一趟木卫三 亲爱的
Just one trip to Ganymede, sweetheart.

275
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,550
别这样嘛甜心 我在回来了
Oh, don't be like that, sugar, I said I'm comin' home.

276
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,630
-亚历克斯 -谢德 他怎么了
- Alex. - Shed, what's wrong with him?

277
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,390
他缺氧了
He's, uh... He's hypoxic.

278
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,090
该死
Oh, shit!

279
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,800
他的呼吸器不行了
His breather's crapping out!

280
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,230
该死 他还能撑多久
Damn it! How long can he hold on?

281
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,000
该死 他快不行了
Oh, oh, shit. We're losin' him!

282
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,180
我们马上回来
We're coming back in.

283
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:37,060
不行 我们没有足够氧气再出舱了
Negative. We don't have enough oxygen to vent again.

284
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,880
谢德 照顾好他 做点什么
Shed, take care of him! Do something!

285
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,350
我们在真空中 他穿着宇航服
We're in a vacuum! He's in a suit! I...

286
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,310
你要我怎么做
What do you want me to do?

287
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,630
没富裕的宇航服
There's no spare!

288
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:52,070
谢德 你是个医生 像样一点好吗
Shed, you're a medic! Act like one!

289
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,250
挺住 伙计
Hold on, buddy.

290
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,540
听着 我要把咱俩的呼吸器连起来 好吗
Listen, I'm hooking our breathers up, okay?

291
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,460
这样我们就能分享氧气了
So we can share air.

292
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,270
你就可以吸我的氧了
So you can breathe off mine, okay?

293
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,680
谢德 怎么样了
Shed, what's happening?

294
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:08,270
好了 坚持住 伙计 拜托
Okay. Hold on, buddy. Come on.

295
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,710
坚持住 亚历克斯 拜托
Hold on, Alex! Come on.

296
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:18,310
好了 呼吸 呼吸 亚历克斯
Yeah, there it is! Breathe! Breathe, Alex!

297
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,850
深呼吸
Breathe it in. Breathe.

298
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,140
继续呼吸 我们真是同呼吸共命运了
Just keep breathing. We're buddy-breathing.

299
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:38,330
会没事的 没事了
It's all gonna be good. It's all good.

300
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:39,720
谢德 听着
Shed, you got this?

301
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,490
今天不能再死人了
No one else dies today.

302
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,610
如果不把无线电修好 我们今天都得死
If we don't get that radio back, we all die... today.

303
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,380
好了 亚历克斯 轮到我了
Okay, Alex. My turn, buddy.

304
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,930
我吸几口就够了
I just need a couple of breaths.

305
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:55,590
这就对了
Ah, that's the stuff.

306
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,470
氧气水平危急

307
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,870
亚历克斯怎么样了
How's Alex doing?

308
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,310
他正坚持着呢
He's hanging in there.

309
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,310
那是什么意思
What does that mean?

310
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,990
意思就是他在坚持着呢
Means he's hanging in there!

311
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,330
继续你手头的事 快点
Get on with it. Hurry up.

312
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,580
别看它
Don't look at it.

313
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,780
想点别的事 好吗
Just think about something else, okay?

314
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,910
比如你的孩子 想想你的孩子
Like your kid. Think about your kid.

315
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,190
他们荡着...
Swinging on a...

316
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,670
荡着秋千还是什么的
Swinging on a swing or something.

317
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,350
你是想让我分散注意力
You're trying to distract me.

318
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,270
伙计们
Hey, guys.

319
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,220
我们...我们的氧气要用完了
We're running out of... We're running out of air.

320
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,240
现在呢
Now?

321
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,780
没有信号
No carrier.

322
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,390
该死的
Ah, piece of shit!

323
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,570
连上了
We have connection.

324
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:25,500
马上回来
Get back in here now!

325
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,610
快
Come on.

326
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,220
-好了 -加压中
- Go! - Pressurizing.

327
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,970
你对我做了什么
What the hell did you do to me?

328
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,640
你救了我的命 兄弟
You saved my hide, partner.

329
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,680
你这个疯子
You crazy son of a bitch.

330
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,370
不客气
Ah, no problem.

331
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,690
我要把他送去月球进一步审讯
I need him sent to Luna for deeper interrogations.

332
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,620
他们预算有限 已经所剩无几了
They have a budget, it's already shot to hell.

333
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,330
我不像你 我得卑躬屈膝地
And unlike you, I have to grovel

334
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:45,250
实现承诺才能换来连任
and promise and deliver to get reappointed.

335
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,590
这和我有关系吗
This concerns me? How?

336
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,160
你离掌管
You're two heartbeats away

337
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,430
这颗星球的政府只有一步之遥
from running the government on this planet.

338
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:56,220
但你却不用对何人负有责任 怎么会这样呢
Yet you're accountable to no one. How does that happen?

339
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:59,160
这孩子不是什么倒霉走私犯
This boy isn't some hapless smuggler.

340
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:03,810
我认为外行星联盟可能是想获得隐形武器
I believe the O.P.A may be trying to obtain stealth weapons.

341
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:05,410
不要每件事都当成外行星联盟的阴谋
Everything is not an O.P.A. plot

342
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:07,520
如果地球都负担不起开发隐形项目
and if Earth can't afford a stealth program,

343
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,250
一帮玩石头的穷鬼怎么负担得起
how can a bunch of rock-tossers?

344
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,460
他们是不行
They can't...

345
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:13,650
除非找到像火星一样的合作者
Unless they've found a new friend like Mars.

346
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,860
冷战就是不流血的战争
Cold war is a bloodless war.

347
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:19,010
互不信任 彻底独立
Mutual distrust and complete co-dependence.

348
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,600
没人想改变这些
Nobody wants to change that.

349
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,760
至少火星人是这样
Least of all Mars.

350
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:25,550
那是另一回事
That's another thing.

351
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:30,320
我要你仔细监视火星上的所有武器设施
I want every Martian weapons facility under a microscope.

352
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,520
已经如此
They are.

353
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:34,160
那个小行星带人会喜欢月球的重力的
You know, your Belter will like gravity on Luna better.

354
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,110
那恐怕是他唯一会喜欢的东西了
That's the only thing he'll like.

355
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,920
我担心他
I'm afraid for him.

356
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,860
上帝保佑你的敌人 克里斯金
Heaven help your enemies, Chrisjen.

357
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,820
火星和小行星带
Heaven help us all

358
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:47,380
要是不分彼此的话 那就是天助你我
if Mars and the Belt decide to share a toothbrush.

359
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:52,480
我敢说那是大胆之举
Bold move, I'll give him that.

360
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,520
什么
What?

361
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:01,020
冷战结束了 这是新出现的问题
The cold war is over, this is something new.

362
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,830
天线可以用了 但信号还是很弱
The antenna's working but our signal's still too weak.

363
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:12,210
发射器没通上电 没用了
The transmitter was severed from the power grid. It's done.

364
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:14,140
情况真是越来越好了啊
This just keeps getting better and better.

365
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,060
所以我们费了一个小时的空气
So we just blew an hour

366
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,360
就为了修一个根本用不了的无线电
of air for a radio that doesn't even work?

367
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:22,130
我们不能自己组装一个放大器吗
Can't we rig ourselves an amplifier?

368
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:25,490
那需要很多电
We're gonna need a shit load of power.

369
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,400
把所有东西拆了
Take everything apart.

370
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,840
动作要快 要小心 船舱已经摇摇欲坠了
Be fast and be careful, we're inside of a limb with a pin here.

371
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,720
把所有有电池 电源组
If it has a battery, a power pack,

372
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,040
以及任何有蓄电功能的东西都拆了
any charge capability, it goes into a part.

373
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:47,430
怎么了 各位是还得先来个按摩吗
I'm sorry, does anyone need a back rub first?

374
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,490
最后一个
Last one.

375
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,120
就算有人收到了我们的求救信号
Even if someone hears our SOS,

376
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,900
他们也会认为我们是太空海盗
they're gonna think we're pirates.

377
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:04,690
那么
Well...

378
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,810
我们只有祈祷
We're gonna just have to pray

379
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:08,610
遇到某个像阿迪一样同情心泛滥的人
there's another caring soul out there like Ade.

380
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:11,790
阿迪 就是因为她我们才会落到这个地步
Ade? She's why we're in this shit right now.

381
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:14,080
如果她没标记那该死的求救信号
If she hadn't gone and logged that stupid distress call...

382
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:16,390
你不知道自己在说什么
You don't know what you are talking about.

383
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,210
说话给我注意点
You wanna keep your teeth in your mouth...

384
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,420
这是在浪费空气
We're wasting air.

385
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,340
帮我说句话好吗 伙计
Give me a hand over here, will you, buddy?

386
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,990
你想减轻自己的负罪感
You want to unburden your soul,

387
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:34,530
麻烦得空了再去
do it on your own time.

388
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:37,350
我们得救的机会如此渺茫
On the remotest chance we get off this alive.

389
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,390
我们的麻烦已经够多的了
We have enough problems right now.

390
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,010
是 长官
Yes, sir.

391
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,820
你知道那家伙的意思是叫你
You know that guy was telling you to go...

392
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,630
自我安慰下的
hump yourself.

393
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,210
天啊 是吗 我都没意识到
Geez... Really? I hadn't realized that.

394
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,210
反正我已经有计划了
I've got plans for it, anyway.

395
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,470
不用问我也知道
Not even gonna ask.

396
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:07,190
外行星联盟

397
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,160
纹身不错啊
Nice tat.

398
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:09,490
你老板允许你像这样露出纹身吗
Your boss lets you wear your colors like that, out in the open?

399
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,000
老板也有个差不多的
Boss has one just like it.

400
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,580
这是一条 向花园东南角供水
Here's the one. Feeds the south-east corner of the gardens.

401
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,850
-这个吗 -对
- This guy? - Yeah.

402
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,790
看这个
Look it, here.

403
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,050
传感器盒应该在你们右边
Sensor box should be to your right.

404
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,090
技术一般
Amateurs.

405
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,190
不过敢打公园的主意胆子不小
But you gotta admire their stones for hittin' the park.

406
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,080
这些管子通向哪儿
Where did you say this pipe diverts to?

407
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,570
十二层 冷凝系统 在一个仓库里
Twelfth Level, condenser grid. It's in a warehouse.

408
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,240
如今哪怕是这种水
Even water like this today,

409
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:18,920
小行星带的承运商也会要
Belter loader gonna want it.

410
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:23,650
尝尝吗
Sa baka.

411
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,930
味道不错 不错
It's good! Good.

412
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,450
可以拿来卖
We can sell it.

413
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,970
可以赚钱去了
Let's make some money!

414
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:35,050
恒星螺旋警察 别动
Star Helix, don't move!

415
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,010
放聪明点
Be smart.

416
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:48,700
来吧 小子
Come on, kid.

417
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,580
你就这点能耐
Is that everything you got?

418
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,660
学着点 警官
Doing my work, cop.

419
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,640
你们这些小混混偷上输水管的水干什么
What are you punks doing stealing up-tunnel water?

420
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,980
免费样品
Free sample.

421
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,770
还挺有精力的嘛
All piss and vinegar.

422
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,300
知道吗 你们很走运
You know, you're lucky

423
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:28,240
是我们在追捕你们 而不是格雷加斯
it's us chasing you and not the Greigas.

424
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:30,490
在他们地盘上撒野
They would feed you your fingers,

425
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,030
他们会让你吃不了兜着走的
for playin' in their district.

426
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,660
格雷加斯已经离开了
Greigas gone.

427
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:36,780
现在是我们的地盘了
This is our turf now.

428
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,440
没人会把他们的地盘丢给一群街头混混
Nobody just abandons their territory to a bunch of street punks.

429
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:42,390
你知道格雷加斯的人很聪明
You see, the Greigas were smart.

430
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,550
他们吸走一点水 然后卖掉
They'd siphon a little water, and sell it off...

431
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,820
没人会发现
Nobody's the wiser.

432
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,740
但你 你们这群小混混
But you, you gutter punks.

433
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:52,160
你们惹到大金主了
You screwed the golden goose.

434
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,980
好啊
Okay, man.

435
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,930
教我该怎么混吗 伙计
Schoolin' me on gangsters, que?

436
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:00,610
没错 人渣学堂开课了
Yeah, dirtbag school's in session.

437
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:04,800
听好了 带上你想要的东西然后给我滚蛋
Listen... Pick all the pockets you want, roll drunks...

438
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,920
但你要是敢打水的主意
But when you mess with the water,

439
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,520
那你就完蛋了
that's when you're going down.

440
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,330
也许在监狱里蹲上几年他就长记性了
Maybe a couple of years on a prison barge will set him straight.

441
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,690
你想蹲监狱吗
Would you like that?

442
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,580
随你怎么做
Do what you gotta do.

443
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:34,010
离开这里
Get out of here.

444
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,330
离水远点
Stay away from the aqua.

445
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,980
告诉你的朋友们
Tell all your friends!

446
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,140
我没想到你会来这一出
I did not see that coming.

447
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,030
是吗
Yeah?

448
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:48,050
那这个呢 你想到了吗
How about this? You see that coming?

449
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:52,480
有啊
Yeah.

450
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:01,930
夫人 抱歉这么晚还给您打电话
Madam, I apologize for calling so late.

451
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:04,990
飞往月球的飞船出了点意外
There's been an incident on the shuttle to Luna.

452
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,480
接着说
Go on.

453
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,330
那个囚犯 哈奇·萨邦
The prisoner, Heikki Sobong took his own life

454
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:12,670
拒绝高重力注射在躺椅上自杀了
by avoiding the high-gravity injections from his crash couch...

455
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,400
他好像挣脱了束缚
It appears he broke free of his restraints,

456
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,920
当时正值加速的关键阶段
during the critical phase of the ascent,

457
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,950
他知道此时护送人员也得进行注射
when he knew the guards would be receiving their own injections.

458
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,980
夫人 我认为他这是在表明态度
I think, madam, he is making a statement.

459
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,680
但说无妨
Speak frankly, please.

460
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,520
我们曾用地球引力折磨他
Earth's gravity. We used it to hurt him.

461
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,090
他这是在打我们的脸
He threw it back in our face.

462
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,000
想告诉我们发现了什么吗
You want to clue us in?

463
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:50,370
我们答复的这个信号源不是海盗的玩意儿
This beacon we answered isn't pirate tech...

464
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,700
是顶级军用物品
It's top-grade military stuff.

465
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,800
主板上的序列标记
Serial stamp on the main board.

466
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:56,980
是火星共和国舰队
Martian Congressional Navy.

467
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,360
那说不通啊
That makes no kind of sense.

468
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,210
这正好说明了一切
It makes all kinds of sense.

469
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,270
袭击坎特号的那艘飞船
That ship that attacked

470
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:04,820
并没有藏在小行星后面
the Cant wasn't tucked behind an asteroid,

471
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:06,350
它就在那里
it was hiding in plain sight.

472
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,070
隐形飞船
A stealth ship...

473
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,900
他们为什么不警告就袭击一艘民用飞船
Why would they nuke a civilian ship without warning?

474
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,430
因为他们可以
Because they can.

475
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:12,500
你不知道你在说什么
You don't know what you're talking about.

476
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,940
我们到底惹上了什么麻烦
What the hell are we tangled up in here?

477
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,240
谁还在乎
Who gives a shit?

478
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:19,360
我们还是考虑怎么活下去
Let's focus on staying alive.

479
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,640
之后再担心火星问题吧
We'll worry about Mars later.

480
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,220
还可以吗
Good so far?

481
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,450
信号不错
Good signal.

482
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,480
我们还有三小时的燃料
We've got three hours of juice.

483
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,890
好吧
Well...

484
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:41,100
我们现在能做的
I guess all we gotta do now is

485
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:45,010
就是开瓶冰啤 等待救援了
pop a cold beer, and wait to be rescued.

486
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,050
没有
Nope.

487
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:09,850
这些码头没有狭背鲸号的记录
Got no record of a Razorback on these docks.

488
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,270
有没有
Any, um,

489
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:14,760
有钱人存放自己喜欢的飞行器的特殊机库
special hangar where rich people keep their pleasure-craft?

490
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:18,270
在谷神星 我没听说过
On Ceres ? Not last I heard.

491
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:29,300
不过 是有一个我一时半会忘不了的姑娘
Now, there's a girl I'm not gonna forget anytime soon.

492
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,640
为什么
Yeah, why's that?

493
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:33,550
前一阵
Uh, few rotations back,

494
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:35,860
她要出行时
some dock-jock was slobbering all over her

495
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,730
有个码头工人对她垂涎三尺
while she was prepping to ship out.

496
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:42,940
那人一定误以为她的好脾气是好欺负
Eh, guy must've mistaken her good manners for encouragement

497
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:45,030
就对她动手动脚
and when he laid hands on her,

498
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,000
老天 她直接把他摔倒在地
God damn, she planted him in the deck.

499
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:50,290
那姑娘有两下子
That girl had skills.

500
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,170
是什么船
What ship was that?

501
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,710
海岩号
Scopuli.

502
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,380
有些破旧
Dumpy old transport.

503
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:01,620
没有货物 就这年轻姑娘和一些船员
No cargo, just this young lady and a few crew.

504
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:02,300
海岩号

505
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:03,220
把船单发给我 好吗
Send me the ship manifest, will you?

506
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,770
还有应答记录之类的
And transponder logs, et cetera?

507
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,250
她惹上了什么麻烦吗
She in some kind of trouble?

508
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,880
没什么她搞不定的
I'm sure it's nothin' she can't handle.

509
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,390
亚历克斯
Alex?

510
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,270
有人听到我们了
Someone heard us.

511
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:58,710
-有人听到我们了 -没错
- Someone heard us? - Yeah.

512
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,100
在等信息回复
Just waiting for the bounce back.

513
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,780
信息已收取
发送坐标

514
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,070
路径已确认

515
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:16,510
那是什么
What is that?

516
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,350
船在来的路上了
Ship en route.

517
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,330
有多远
How far?

518
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,960
大概八万公里
It's almost 80,000 clicks.

519
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:32,050
还真是死里逃生
It's gonna be a hell of a close shave.

520
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,670
我们会挺过去的
We'll make it.

521
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,530
怎么 怎么了
What? What is it?

522
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:46,040
那艘船 是火星的
The ship. It's Mars.

523
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,720
什么
What?

524
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,620
唐纳吉尔号
The Donnager.

525
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:54,650
火星舰队的旗舰
The flagship of the Martian Navy.

526
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:57,080
应答器确认  火星舰队唐纳吉尔号

527
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:59,270
来完成未完成的事
Coming to finish the job.

528
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,320
我们还把坐标给了他们
And we just told 'em where we were.

529
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:33,610
其在回应一个遇险信号后失踪
which disappeared while responding to a distress call.

530
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,500
据称坎特伯雷号
The Canterbury was reported

531
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:37,130
携带有冰块 正开往谷神星空间站
to be carrying ice, bound for Ceres station.

532
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,720
该批货物的损失造成
And the loss of that shipment has prompted

533
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:41,910
空间站内饮水配给急剧增长
a drastic increase in water rationing station-wide.

534
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,240
一位发言人
A spokesperson...

535
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:43,180
天啊 毛小姐 你可真会挑人
Good golly, Ms. Mao. You sure can pick 'em.

536
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,430
找到那位失踪的女继承人了
Find your lost heiress yet?

537
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,760
这个
Well...

538
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,920
她不在谷神星
She's not on Ceres.

539
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,680
乘海岩号出行了
Shipped out on the Scopuli.

540
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,930
出发后就失去联系了
It just went dark right after take-off.

541
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,800
不见了
Vanished.

542
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,900
这周失踪的船还真多
The week for vanishing ships.

543
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:15,100
你觉得像她一样的有钱女孩儿
You'd think a rich girl

544
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,420
不会想把那胎记去掉吗
like her would've had that birthmark fixed.

545
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,520
不好说 如果那是胎记
I don't know. If it was a birthmark,

546
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,400
她父母就会帮她去掉了
her parents would have had it fixed.

547
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,290
那是伤疤
That's a scar.

548
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:32,850
我觉得她不想把那弄掉
I don't think she wanted it fixed.

549
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,620
为什么这么说
Why do you say that?

550
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:38,130
这是反抗的象征
Oh, it's a badge of defiance.

551
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,840
反抗她本应有的身份
Against everything she's supposed to be.

552
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:52,890
她跟你说的吗
Wow. She tell you that herself?

553
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,420
没错
Yeah, she did.

554
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,290
听着 只有我们知道坎特号发生了什么
Listen, we're the only ones who know what happened to the Cant.

555
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:14,680
如果上了那艘船 很可能就出不来了
We get on that ship and chances are we're never comin' out.

556
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,610
除非
Unless...

557

-那是个陷阱 -你疯了吗

证实坎特伯雷号是被火星摧毁

00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,050
就能传出去了

别指望了
Don't count on it.

我们处在他们的干扰范围内
