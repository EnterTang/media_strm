2
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,650
Do you think she's prettier than me?

3
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,960
I do.

4
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,860
That may just be a family bias.

5
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,370
We owned this in the 17th century,

6
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:33,470
then lost it along Wita lot
of heads during the revolution.

7
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,010
So how are things going
with our Detective?

8
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:40,130
They're not.He's not interested in me.

9
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,160
Maybe we need to try a little
harder.He did save your life.

10
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,740
Apparently,he doesn't feel
right taking advantage of that.

11
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,340
You know how to make
yourself irresistible.

12
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:53,450
I do,but it's gonna
require a little effort.

13
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,360
Well,the sooner the better.

14
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:01,500
Lucky for you,he had
a physical recently.

15
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,780
Why is this so important to you?

16
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,370
It's important to you too.

17
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:10,160
A Grimm on the other side
isn't good for either one of us.

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,790
So why am I not going after him?

19
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:21,040
Because the way to a man's
soul is through his friends.

20
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,910
Now go fall in love.

21
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,810
I think she's fat.

22
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,610
Nick,I wanna ask you something.

23
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:38,200
- That sounds important.
- Well,it sort of is.

24
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,860
I think it's time...

25
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:52,030
Look,Juliette.If you have
something to say,just say it.

26
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:55,040
But I know it's been
a little tough lately...

27
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:59,090
No,no,I wanna learn to shoot.

28
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,210
- W... a gun?
- No,a bow and arrow.Yes,a gun.

29
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,340
Oh,I thought you didn't like guns.

30
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,800
I don't,but you know
what I like even less?

31
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:11,600
Feeling unsafe in my own home.

32
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,150
- Are you expecting anyone?
- No.You?

33
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,450
I thought I told you
never to come back here.

34
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,150
No,please don't take this
wrong.Don't jump to any conclusions.

35
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,610
It's just that I feel so bad...

36
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,890
We all felt so bad about what happened here
at your house you share with your not-wife,

37
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,570
who is lovely,by the
way.Oh,and here she is.

38
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,620
- Hello,ma'am.
- Hi.

39
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,900
We made you both a little something.

40
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:41,250
If you ever decide to get
married and have a family...

41
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,020
Uh,or not.Uh,well,here it is.

42
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:49,130
Oh,and by the way,we're making
sure no one else bothers you again.

43
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,690
One more thing,I noticed that
you door needs a little work.

44
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,290
- Maybe you hadn't noticed.
- Well,I've been a little busy.

45
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,950
Right,right,of course you
have.Well,anyway,I didn't mean to interrupt.

46
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,540
Thanks again so much for everything.Uh,enjoy...
go back to whatever... uh,bye.

47
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,800
The refrigerator repairman is
gonna keep people from bothering us?

48
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,680
I don't understand.

49
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:16,430
Yeah,uh,remember that license plate you
wrote down?Those people who were watching us?

50
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,970
- Yeah.
- Well,I went to their house and he was there.

51
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,980
- The refrigerator repairman?
- Yeah.

52
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,460
And I told them to stop bothering us.

53
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,910
Well,did they say anything?Did they
explain why they were watching our house?

54
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,700
Well,apparently they had had
some trouble with some guy

55
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,580
and they thought I was that guy and
they just wanted to see if I was.

56
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,170
Well,who was the guy
they thought you were?

57
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,720
You know what,I didn't actually
get the details on that.

58
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,110
But I guess they felt really
bad about their mistake.

59
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,790
Why don't we open this up?

60
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,740
Oh,it's really beautiful.

61
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,360
Yeah,it is.

62
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,970
They must have felt really bad.

63
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,960
- This is gonna be a big score for us.
- Yeah,big.

64
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,460
I'm feeling good.

65
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,660
I'm real good.

66
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,470
Let's do this.

67
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,110
Come on.Come on!Come on!

71
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:19,730
Hi.Remember me?

72
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,470
Of course.Wh... what can I do for you?

73
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,050
I made a list.

74
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:37,450
Coeur diable,rot inguen,essigblasse.

75
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,250
Hmm,let me get it for you.

76
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,250
- Freddy.
- Yes?

77
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,360
- Fresh.
- Yes,ma'am.

78
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,150
Absolutely.

79
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,890
Let's do this.

80
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,560
Come on.

81
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,620
- How much do I owe you?-
Nothing,I-it's on the house.

82
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:13,170
That is so sweet.Thank you,Freddy.

83
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:16,020
Anytime.

84
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,630
- Can I help you?
- Where's the "j"?

85
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,260
*******

86
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,300
Idiot,where is it?

87
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:46,260
And I want the pharmaceutical-grade
stuff,not the crap you've got on the shelf.

88
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,800
In the basement.

89
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,060
Let's go.

90
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:16,730
- Where is it?
- It's gotta be here somewhere.

91
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,990
Got some.I got some!

92
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,720
Mother lode.Come on.

93
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,390
We gotta get out of here.Forget
about it.The cops are gonna be here.

94
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,130
- There's boxes over here.
- Let's go!

95
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,660
- Thanks for the "j," man!
- Later.

96
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:48,710
Come on!We gotta get
out of here!Let's go!

97
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,500
Clint,come on!

98
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,240
- Let's go.
- Oh,my leg!

99
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,750
- Let's go.We gotta move.
- He bit my leg.

100
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:05,170
Well,he was shot at close range.There's
some powder burns on his clothing.

101
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:09,040
- Got some blood in his mouth.
- Internal bleeding,maybe.

102
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,740
Looks kinda human.

103
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,520
He took a bite out of his killer?

104
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:20,200
- Looks like it.
- Makes for some good DNA.

105
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,030
Why kill the owner of
a tea and spice shop?

106
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,940
How much money could there
be in a place like this?

107
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,550
Maybe he was dealing under the table.

108
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,610
I've checked this guy out once before.

109
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,690
- Fuchsbau,right?
- Oh,my God.

110
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,790
There's a basement.

111
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,390
Awful lot of herbs and spices.

112
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,100
Yeah,who knows what all this stuff is?

113
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,390
We'd better get it all tested.

114
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,210
We've gotta check phone
records and find next of kin.

115
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:59,400
I got a Rosalee Calvert,victim's
sister.Listed as beneficiary,lives in Seattle.

116
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,330
- You want me to make the call?
- No,it's my turn.

117
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,750
- Hello?
- Is this Rosalee Calvert?

118
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,270
Yes.

119
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:25,250
This is Detective Burkhardt from
the Portland police department.

120
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:29,920
Uh,you have a brother,Frederick Calvert?

121
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,330
Yes.

122
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,390
{\a6}********

123
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,060
Okay,let's see.

124
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:40,120
Time for blood of the deceived.

125
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:51,900
And... Blood of the deceiver.

126
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,670
Detectives Burkhardt,Griffin,this
is Rosalee Calvert.

127
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:18,920
I'm sorry you had to come down
here under these circumstances.

128
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,230
Please,sit down.

129
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,590
- Who killed him?
- We don't know yet.

130
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,140
- What do you know?
- He was killed in an apparent robbery.

131
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,370
Since no money was taken,we assume
they were after something in the shop.

132
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:36,040
He was able to set off the emergency alarm,so
we don't know if they got what they were after.

133
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,000
What do you know about
your brother's business?

134
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:45,570
He sold tea,spices,and
herbs.Not very complicated.

135
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:50,940
My brother didn't have any enemies that
I know of.Is that your next question?

136
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:54,710
Do you know if your brother
was dealing in anything illegal?

137
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,940
No,I saw him once a year and I
spoke to him mostly on the phone.

138
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:02,080
I want to bury him.

139
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,330
I want to close up his shop
and and I wanna go home.

140
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,520
So what do I have to
do to get that done?

141
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,670
Lab reports are in.

142
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,000
I'd like to go to the
shop.Can I do that?

143
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,180
Well,we are done with our investigation,

144
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,970
but one of us will have to go with
you until we know forensics are done.

145
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,220
We don't know if that's
all your brother's blood.

146
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,790
All right,he might have taken
a bite out of the killer.

147
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,590
I didn't hurt your
brother.I'm not gonna hurt you.

148
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:02,950
Do you know anything about Gallenblase?

149
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:07,230
- Human gallbladder.
- I know what it is.

150
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,660
Did you know your brother was dealing?

151
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,160
No.

152
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,310
- He was being supplied by Geiers.
- Is that who killed him?

153
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,540
That was my first thought.

154
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,080
But I think whoever killed
him was after something else.

155
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:28,370
- What?
- I was hoping you could tell me.

156
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:32,040
I have no idea what he has in here.

157
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,890
But I'll look.

158
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,120
- Yeah?
- Went over the lab reports.

159
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,360
We've got a big fat nothing.

160
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,620
Just like the sign says...
Herbs,spices,and teas.

161
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,010
A few are poisonous,but
none are illegal.

162
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,070
- You get anything?
- Not yet.

163
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:58,850
I think the sister's
clean.I'm coming back.

164
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:08,490
If you can think of anything...

165
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,300
Or if you need
anything,just... Just call me.

166
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,380
You're not at all what I expected.

167
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,620
Yeah.

168
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:23,850
- If you find out anything...
- I'll call you.

169
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,160
Doesn't it hurt?

170
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,600
What do you think?

171
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:48,260
- Well,you shouldn't have shot him!
- He wasn't chomping on your leg.

172
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:51,830
Ah,police are gonna be
all over this thing now.

173
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,710
We're going back.

174
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,740
- What?
- We left a fortune in there.

175
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,990
Cops don't know what we're after and
they'll be done going over the place by now.

176
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,990
Give me the needle.Give it to me.

177
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,230
Hey,how you doing?

178
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:30,070
Hi.This is embarrassing.I just
stopped by to leave you some cookies.

179
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,110
Yeah?

180
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,410
I was doing some baking and I thought
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you,

181
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,630
so here I am.

182
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,320
You know,you already bought me dinner.

183
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:41,890
I know I didn't have to do this.

184
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:47,770
But you saved my life,and believe
it or not,that meant something to me.

185
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:51,440
It's hard to know how to repay that.This
is more for me than it is for you.

186
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,430
You might not even like
chocolate chip cookies.

187
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:57,090
Well,in fact,I do.

188
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,970
And that was very nice of you.

189
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,140
Maybe I should have a bite.

190
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:07,900
Maybe you should wait till I'm
gone in case you don't like them.

191
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,130
I'm a brave soul.

192
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:16,990
Do we have a verdict?

193
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:21,820
We do.They're incredible.

194
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:27,530
Don't go giving those away.I
made them just for you.

195
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,710
Uh,nothing in the
spice shop was illegal.

196
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,060
It's really a shame.He was a nice guy.

197
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,040
Is there anything in these reports
that someone would kill for?

198
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,920
I'm sure there is.

199
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,120
But I don't know what
any of these words mean.

200
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,610
Beramethyl silacybanate?

201
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,570
Hornisolic fullmanoxin?

202
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,000
I mean,what the heck is
this stuff?I have no idea.

203
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:14,240
- Could you tell by looking at it?
- Maybe.

204
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:20,870
********

205
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,810
Another partner?

206
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,030
Sort of.

207
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,210
This is Monroe.Monroe,this
is Rosalee Calvert.

208
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,200
I knew your brother.I'm sorry.

209
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,110
We need to get into the basement.

210
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:42,340
- Do you need me to go with you?
- No,just a little follow up.

211
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,450
Okay.

212
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,780
Hey,this box was opened and it looks
like some of the vials were taken.

213
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,750
I can't be certain,but it
looks a little bit like "j".

214
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,850
- "J"?
- It's derived from Jansene.It's a kind of mold.

215
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:10,830
It's lethal to most of humanity,but
it has an opiate-like effect on... us.

216
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,000
Used correctly,it's an
incredible painkiller,

217
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,540
but if it's used for recreational purposes,it's
like meth mixed with rat poison and helium.

218
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,980
It's highly addictive.

219
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,670
It's terrible for your liver and it's
not so good for your brain either.

220
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:27,460
Of course,if you had a brain,you wouldn't
be using the stuff in the first place.

221
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:31,580
- Did you find something?
- Do you know of a drug called "j"?

222
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,930
- Yes.
- Do you know if your brother was selling it?

223
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,680
Even if he was,it's... it's not illegal.

224
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:43,150
She's right.That's why you... you
know,the cop you... Has never heard of it.

225
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,490
I need to know everything in this
basement that a Wesen would kill for.

226
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:48,930
Will it help you find the
men who killed my brother?

227
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:52,430
- I hope so.
- Then I'll do it now.

228
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:56,440
Okay.I'll call you later.

229
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,280
You said you knew my brother?

230
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,950
Yes.

231
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:18,320
I just wanted to make sure.

232
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,410
So they don't know,do they?

233
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:25,780
- Who?
- The cops you work with.They don't know who you are.

234
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,320
No.

235
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,140
Does it matter?

236
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:36,870
I'm just trying to...
Understand how... How this works.

237
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,780
It's,um... It's a little complicated.

238
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:46,840
Yeah,I can see that.Just find
the men who killed my brother.

239
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:25,220
- Oh,my gosh,you scared me.
- Sorry.

240
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,320
- What are you doing?
- Oh,the door.

241
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,950
When I was here before,I
noticed that it needed work,

242
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,090
and well,Nick is so busy and I thought maybe
I'd come over and help out a little bit.

243
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:37,160
I'm really good at this stuff.I
can fix just about anything.

244
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,100
Oh,before I forget...

245
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:43,720
My wife baked you folks
a little something.

246
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,630
Uh,hope you like cherry.

247
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,440
That's really nice,but
you do not have to...

248
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:50,720
No,really,we want to.My wife insisted.

249
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,790
She makes incredible pies,believe me.

250
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:58,420
So,uh,your door should
be fine now.So,uh,enjoy.

251
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:01,490
- What about your basket?
- Oh,that's for you too.

252
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,760
My kids made it.

253
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:24,060
Come on.Let's go.

254
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,440
- Lights are on.
- Why are the lights on?

255
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:32,080
Because somebody
forgot to turn them off.

256
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:35,280
Let's just get the stuff
and get the hell out of here.

257
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:38,660
These are open.Why are they open?

258
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,700
Must be yours.

259
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:45,990
No.Mine's in the car.

260
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:43,950
- She cut me.
- Shut up and help me.

261
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,020
Don't you think it's
going a little overboard?

262
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,890
Maybe they're just
generous people,you know?

263
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,950
Did he really fix the door?

264
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,370
And he did a good job.

265
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,560
- Yeah,Burkhardt.
- It's Rosalee.

266
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:05,830
I was at the shop and two men
broke in while I was there.

267
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:08,570
- Are you okay?
- Yes,I'm f... I'm fine.

268
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:12,240
I'm scared,but I'm fine.I got
away.I'm at my brother's house.

269
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,980
- Are you safe there?
- I think so.

270
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:17,590
Okay,can you identify
the men who broke in?

271
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:20,040
If I saw them again,yes.

272
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:24,090
Now give me your address.I'm
sending officers to pick you up.

273
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:27,980
- You sure?
- Positive.

274
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,550
How do you do this?

275
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,280
Well,we start with the
last known addresses,

276
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,380
- see if we can find them or somebody who knows them...
- I mean you,as a cop.

277
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:39,280
And the people you
work with have no idea?

278
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,910
Well,I do what I can do.

279
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,670
I don't envy you.

280
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:50,010
It's not easy living two lives.

281
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:52,880
Suppose you checked into mine.

282
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,900
Next of kin are usually
the first suspects.

283
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,580
You were arrested a couple
times for breaking and entering?

284
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,200
A long time ago.

285
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,570
- You wanna talk about it?
- Not really.I cleaned up my act.

286
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,720
So what am I supposed to do now?

287
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,110
Be careful.

288
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:16,420
I'm gonna have some officers take you back
to your brother's house and stay outside.

289
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:19,790
What about your partner?

290
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,980
- Hank?
- No,the other one.

291
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:27,020
I want someone that I have
something in common with.

292
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:49,940
Hi,um,Nick called.

293
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:54,140
He... he thought it would be a good idea
if I came over and,you know,kept an eye...

294
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,240
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah.

295
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,260
Can't be too careful.

296
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:11,350
That's why I wanted a
Blutbad instead of a cop.

297
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,790
The guys who came to the
shop were Skalengecks.

298
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:17,420
- Great.
- You'll be able to smell them a mile away.

299
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,820
There's food in the
fridge.You get the couch.

300
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:24,970
- Good night.
- Good night.

301
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,000
Take it easy.

302
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,490
- It's just me.
- Yeah,sorry,I can see that now.

303
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:06,930
I really appreciate what you
did.I'm gonna go to the shop.

304
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,050
Excuse me?You think that's a good idea?

305
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,610
I have no intention of staying
here any longer than I have to.

306
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:15,970
- I've got a lot to take care of.
- Okay,can we just slow down a second?

307
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:20,510
Why would these guys kill a shopkeeper for
some herbs and spices that aren't even illegal?

308
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,990
It just doesn't make any sense.

309
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,260
Well,there are plenty of legal
substances that'll still fry your brain.

310
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:32,370
- Burkhardt.
- Rosalee says she's going to the shop.

311
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,940
- Where are you?
- I'm still at her brother's place.

312
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:37,930
- What do you want me to do?
- Cookie.

313
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:42,010
- Did you bring enough for everyone?
- No.

314
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,030
My mother made the best
cookies on the block.

315
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:48,250
She shared them with everyone
and they loved her for it.

316
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,790
Well,do you think you
can talk her out of it?

317
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,120
All right,I'll go cookie-less.

318
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:54,370
Just stay with her.I'll
send someone over there.

319
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:57,220
- See ya.
- Hang on.Hang on.

320
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:58,530
What have we got?

321
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:02,240
Looks like we got a vehicle I.D.
For Clint Vickers,one of our perps.

322
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:05,680
We got a patrol car on the street
watching the car.So far,no sightings.

323
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:08,530
Okay,I need you to go back to the
spice shop,keep an eye on things.

324
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:11,520
- We'll check out the car.
- Yeah.You got it.

325
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:32,650
Okay,that's the car and I'm
guessing they're in that building.

326
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,580
- Any contact?
- No movement.

327
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:38,380
All right,you go around
back.We'll take the front.

328
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,780
*****

329
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,300
***************

330
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,830
Hank.

331
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,830
Hank?

332
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:42,290
- Hey.Hank.
- I saw someone.

333
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:45,850
Who?

334
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,450
I don't know.

335
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,860
It's gonna be sad to
see this place close.

336
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,620
There's not that many
places we can go anymore.

337
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:12,870
- It's not an easy business.
- You were in it?

338
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,480
My parents were.They were apothecaries.

339
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,070
I gave it a shot.

340
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:22,670
- And what happened?
- Hey.

341
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:28,750
I'm supposed to,uh... Uh,come down
here and,uh,make sure everything is...

342
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,260
You don't look so
good.Are you all right?

343
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:35,640
Yeah.Yeah.Never better.

344
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:38,030
Oh,my God.

345
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,270
Oh,God.

346
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,200
What the hell is this?

347
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,430
My guess is they use it to
smoke whatever they wanna smoke.

348
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:03,590
They got away.You mind
telling me what happened?

349
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,300
They made us when we got here,captain.

350
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,180
We lost them.

351
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:10,670
- Captain,it was my fault.
- How?

352
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,450
I thought I saw somebody.I
didn't want them to get hurt.

353
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:18,590
I got distracted and... They got away.

354
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:28,880
- Yeah?
- This cop you sent down here is in really bad shape.

355
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:30,720
I mean,he just walked in and collapsed.

356
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,440
And his whole face looks like a
volcano that's about to explode.

357
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:38,470
Rosalee says there's only one way to
deal with this and it is definitely not,

358
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:43,270
you know,standard medical practice,so
you gotta get down here.Fast.

359
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,620
Uh,I sent Sergeant Wu to the spice
shop and I think he has something.

360
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:52,640
So if you cover
this,I'll see what he has?

361
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,210
Go.

362
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:00,820
We all make mistakes,Hank.Luckily,no
one got hurt.

363
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:04,430
I can't find the... The keim
extract.Are you sure it's here?

364
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:06,390
Top shelf,corner right.I
saw some yesterday.

365
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,710
Got it.

366
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:14,470
- All of it?
- He'll need it.

367
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:19,450
- We need to get him to a hospital.
- They won't know what to do.

368
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:23,370
They'll read it as one of those mystery
infections they can't identify and he'll die.

369
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:25,760
I've seen this before.

370
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:28,220
Hold him down!Hold... Hold him down.

371
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:32,240
Hold him down.Hold him down.

372
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:36,780
Here we go.Here we go... okay.

373
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,000
- Hurry up.This is not going well.
- Open his mouth.

374
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:46,920
- Wait.You want him to drink it?
- Yeah,he better.

375
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,840
- Come on.
- Get his mouth.

376
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,850
Hello?

377
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,630
- Adalind?
- Yes?

378
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,700
It's me,Hank.I've been calling
and you haven't been picking up.

379
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,580
- I got worried.
- About what?

380
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,760
Just wanted to make sure you're okay.

381
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,450
That's very sweet,but I'm fine.

382
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,960
Good.

383
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:32,430
Is everything okay with you?

384
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,830
Yeah.Just a lot going on.

385
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:40,470
Listen,I was thinking maybe we
should get together for dinner.

386
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:45,060
Oh,I'm really busy this week.

387
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:51,300
But why don't you give me a call at
the end of the week and we'll see.Okay?

388
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:54,970
- Sure.
- Bye,Hank.

389
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,020
How much longer?

390
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:04,580
His pulse has calmed down.

391
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:06,770
We might as well have a look.

392
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,740
I think it worked.

393
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:27,070
He's gonna sleep for quite a while.Is
there some place we can take him?

394
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:29,640
I think it would be best if he
woke up in familiar surroundings.

395
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:33,300
- His apartment's not far.
- I'll get his feet.

396
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:48,130
- You said you've seen this before?
- Yeah,at my parents' shop.

397
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:50,210
I was probably 17.

398
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:53,180
A friend of my father's came
in with the same symptoms.

399
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:56,810
My father said he had ingested a
Zaubertrank meant for somebody else.

400
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:58,450
Zaubertrank?They can be nasty.

401
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,380
Does somebody wanna tell
me what a Zaubertrank is?

402
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:05,290
Primitive,antediluvian,pseudo-psychological
concoctions meant to mess with your head.

403
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:07,090
It causes obsessive behaviors.

404
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:10,400
If the right person takes it,it
creates a deep emotional response,

405
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:13,630
but if the wrong person
takes it,this happens.

406
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,040
I think we caught it in time.

407
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,520
- Can we leave him alone?
- Yeah,he should be... Good for a few hours.

408
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,750
All right.We almost caught the
man who killed your brother.

409
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,760
But they got away.

410
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,650
In their apartment,we found the boxes
of "j" that they stole from the shop,

411
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:29,490
and we also found this pipe.It
kind of looked like a horn.

412
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:31,990
- A Saugendampf.
- Oh,man.

413
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,850
Addicts.And you got their stash?

414
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:38,580
They will be needing more,and I am telling
you,addicts with guns is a bad combo.

415
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:41,590
- Where would they go for more?
- Don't look at me.

416
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:43,900
I'm not.

417
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:49,070
I have a feeling you know.

418
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,750
Yeah.

419
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,180
I was hooked for seven years.

420
00:35:56,190 --> 00:36:00,860
My brother finally helped me to get
clean.That's why I went to Seattle.

421
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,880
If they're looking to score,it'll
be an island of dreams.

422
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,540
- A Trauminsel?Here?
- They're everywhere.

423
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,900
Are we talking about some
kind of Wesen crack house?

424
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,650
- Yeah.
- Well,how do we find it?

425
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:16,840
We find a dealer.They'll know.

426
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:27,750
You're kidding me.Rosalee?

427
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,920
- You're looking good.
- Thanks.

428
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,880
Thought you went straight,baby.

429
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,210
- What you doing around these parts again?
- You know why I'm here.

430
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:38,620
That's a shame.How much
Trauminsel time you want?

431
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:41,300
Enough for two.

432
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:47,100
****

433
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,770
Sweet dreams.

434
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,120
It's my brother,I should
be the one that goes in.

435
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:07,370
You've done enough.

436
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,290
Let me handle this,okay?Just
don't act like a cop.

437
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:16,230
We're just a couple of Blutbaden
out on the town,having a good time.

438
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,880
What up,bro?

439
00:37:56,230 --> 00:38:01,000
I can't smell anyone in
here,man.This is brutal.

440
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:05,200
You take those,but be careful.

441
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,510
- Whoa,bro!
- Hey!

442
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:56,810
This dude's shootin' people!

443
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,490
Run!

444
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:12,650
I got him,Nick!I got him!

445
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:50,320
- Now you're sure you're okay?
- Yeah,yeah.

446
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:56,180
Don't remember much.I went
to that shop like you wanted.

447
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:59,550
Then woke up here.

448
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:01,420
Had some weird-ass dreams.

449
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,550
Clearly,I'm gonna need a facial.

450
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,170
Now I'm just kinda... kinda hungry.

451
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:10,130
- You got something to eat here?
- Oh,yeah,yeah,I'm good.

452
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:11,590
I'm good.

453
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:16,210
Listen,you take it easy for the next couple
of days and if you need anything,you call me.

454
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:20,260
Yes,will do.Thanks.

455
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:22,210
All right.

456
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:07,840
- Oh,hey.
- Hi.

457
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:15,190
Now,I know it's not...
Equal trade for my life,

458
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:19,950
but I just wanted to say,I'm glad you
know how to clock a dude with a brick.

459
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:24,440
Nobody's given me
flowers for a long time.

460
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:31,590
So,what's going on?I
thought you were packing up.

461
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,760
Sort of changed my mind and...

462
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,870
Had to stick around for the trial,so I thought
I'd keep the shop open till I had to sell it.

463
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,760
And I'd forgotten,Portland's
a pretty nice place.

464
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:47,360
- Yeah,kinda grows on you.
- Yeah.

465
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,650
Well,I got the rest of the day
off if,you know,you need any help.

466
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,460
Sure.

467
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,830
I'll put these in water.

468
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:14,960
Are you sure you've
never done this before?

469
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:34,050
