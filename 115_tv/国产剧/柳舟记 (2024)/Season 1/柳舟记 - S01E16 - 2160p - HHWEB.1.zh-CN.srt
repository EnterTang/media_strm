Previously on Grimm...

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,210
- Can I buy you dinner?
- Sure,sounds great.

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:07,160
So how are things going
with our Detective?

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,410
He's not interested in me.

5
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,960
You know how to make
yourself irresistible.

6
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,030
- I do.
- ****

7
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,740
- Well,the sooner,the better.
- Blood of the deceived.

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,390
I was doing some baking.

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,260
Now,don't go giving those
away. I made them just for you.

10
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,390
Cookie.

11
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:34,970
************

12
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,150
- You got the Burroughs report?
- Gave it to me.

13
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,780
- And the autopsy on Clyde Harrington?
- It's not coming till Monday.

14
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,280
- What about ballistics?
- Nick. Go.

15
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,970
The wheels of justice will keep
turning,at least for one weekend.

16
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,940
Right.

17
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:55,120
- Okay,I'm going.
- Good.

18
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,540
You're not leaving.

19
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,560
What if she says no?

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,170
She's not going to say
no to a romantic weekend.

21
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:19,070
Oh,man. This is it. You're bringing it.

22
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,170
I can't believe it.

23
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,460
You're finally taking the
big leap in front of the bus.

24
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,590
Yeah,I'm thinking,uh...Yeah,maybe
dinner tomorrow night,

25
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,730
someplace quiet,romantic...

26
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,140
Look,take it from me.

27
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,550
The where doesn't matter
as much as the who.

28
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,250
- Well,if you need me...
- I won't.

29
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,190
I wrote down the number of the
place I'm staying right there.

30
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:46,000
"Whispering pines: For
the rest of your life."

31
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,390
Will you get the hell out of here?

32
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,000
Yes,I'm going,okay?
Good-bye,you're gonna miss me.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,430
Au revoir,auf wiedersehen, arrivederci.

34
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,340

********

36
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,570
- Hey,Robin.
- Where are you?

37
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:12,340
- I'm sorry,my just car broke down.
- I can't stay here any longer.

38
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,700
I'm waiting for a tow.We'll
have to do it tomorrow.

39
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,940
Tomorrow? I... I was barely
able to get out today.

40
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,530
- If... if he finds out...
- I know. I'm doing everything I can.

41
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:26,630
Okay,tomorrow,but please
promise me you'll be here,okay?

42
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,080
- I don't have much time left.
- I will do my best.

43
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,910
Any big plans for tonight?

44
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,840
Um,no. You?

45
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,450
You bet. Gonna curl up on
that couch with my cat Samson,

46
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,420
watch tapprentice marathon,
and have a bite to eat.

47
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:00,530
Another badass Portland Friday night.

48
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,430
You got it.

49
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,130
Robin.

50
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,100
You know it's not safe
for you to be outside.

51
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,320
I... I just wanted some air.

52
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,210
It's time to eat.

53
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,110
No.

54
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,590
No,please.

55
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:15,640
Come on,you know how important it is for
you to get your vitamins in your condition.

59
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,720
You sure you know where we're going?

60
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:27,140
We're looking for pine meadows drive.

61
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,640
The house has a name.
It's called "owl's nest."

62
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,550
This is where we're staying?

63
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,350
- No.
- Good.Then why are we here?

64
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,200
Oh,this is where I stop
to ask where we're staying.

65
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:48,120
Be right back.

66
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,830
- Hey. Can I help you?
- Uh,yeah.

67
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,450
I'm Nick Burkhardt.
Uh,sorry to bother you.

68
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:04,200
I'm staying at a house called
"the owl's nest."It's on,uh,pine...

69
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,890
Pine meadow drive. Yeah,you've arrived.

70
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:10,250
Sorry,it was,uh,a drunk driver
knocked down the sign last weekend.

71
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,810
Robin?

72
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,220
Uh,sorry,in middle of cooking.

73
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:21,780
Uh,the house is just up the road there.

74
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,850
Okay.

75
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,720
- Yeah,thanks.
- It's not a problem.

76
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:45,190
Damn it,Robin.You know what
we're gonna have to do now.

77
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,270
It's just up the road.And
for the record,I was not lost.

78
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,830
Drunk driver hit the post.

79
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:05,020
Hey,you okay?

80
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,930
I get a creepy feeling from that place.

81
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,560
Well...Fortunately,we're
not staying there.

82
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,490
Oh,my God,look at this place!

83
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,160
Wow. It's a lot of wood.

84
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,200
- You don't like it.
- No,I love it.

85
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:53,700
I would love an igloo with you.

86
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:31,450
Hi,this is Adalind.Sorry,I'm
not here to take your call.

87
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,320
Please leave a message
and I'll call you back.

88
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,210
Well put.

89
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:23,140
- Gonna get some glasses.
- Okay.

90
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,520
Robin!

91
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:30,290
Get inside!

92
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,020
Nick?

93
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,390
you got to do something.

94
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,450
- What's wrong?
- Down at the house,they're having a huge fight,

95
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,160
and he just grabbed her
and dragged her inside.

96
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,040
- Oh,wait,wait.How do you know?
- I just saw it.

97
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,280
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

98
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,250
All right.I'm gonna
call the local police.

99
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,400
If there's trouble down there,they might already
know about it,and if they don't,they should.

100
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:03,040
Yeah,this is Nick Burkhardt,I want to report a
domestic disturbance at 1800 pine meadows drive.

101
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,980
Thank you.

102
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,090
Hey.Sheriff's on his way.

103
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,920
No. No,please.No more.

104
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,850
Sorry,baby...But it's got to be done.

105
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,760
Can I help you?

106
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:14,310
- You can help yourself.
- What?

107
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,860
You can get in the car, you can drive
away,and you can never come back.

108
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,110
All right. Hey,pal,I don't know...

109
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm a cop.

110
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,050
And I do not repeat myself.

111
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:14,840
We received an emergency call about
a domestic dispute at this residence.

112
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,010
May I come inside?

113
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,220
It looks like the
sheriff's got it from here.

114
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,410
I was so excited to be
getting out of Portland,

115
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:36,950
but somehow... I don't know.Does it
feel like trouble is following us?

116
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,290
Well,I don't know. Maybe.

117
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,750
Yeah.Trouble again.

118
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,660
Maybe we should talk about this.

119
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,930
Talk about what?

120
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,420
The stuff that's been happening lately.

121
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,630
Run!

122
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,190
Who comes for her?

123
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,270
- Yeah,it's... Been a lot.
- Yeah.

124
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,130
And we haven't talked
about it. Not really.

125
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:18,360
Listen,Juliette,listen to me.

126
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,200
All that stuff is gonna calm down.

127
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:30,850
- I don't believe it.
- What?

128
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:37,130
Why isn't he arresting that animal?

129
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,290
If there's no obvious
signs of assault...

130
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:43,100
So what,this sheriff's just going to ignore the
whole thing,and pretend like it never happened?

131
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,200
If the wife doesn't press
charges,there's nothing we can do.

132
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,390
Maybe she'll press charges next time.

133
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,670
Maybe next time she'll be dead.

134
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,960
Hey. Look. I know it's a lousy answer.

135
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,350
I wish I had better one,but I don't.

136
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,680
We did everything we could.

137
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:12,840
It doesn't feel like it was enough.

138
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:34,020
- How'd it go?
- He threatened me.

139
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,240
If I stayed longer,I don't
know what he would have done.

140
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,040
Then it's going well.

141
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:41,650
- Is there anything else I can do,sir?
- I'll let you know.

142
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,710
Thank you for giving
me this opportunity.

143
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,880
You're welcome. Good night.

144
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,960
- Hello?
- Hey,Monroe. It's Nick.

145
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,850
Nick... It's 2:30.

146
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,880
Yeah,I know. I'm sorry.

147
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:13,060
I have a Bikram class at 6:00 a.m.,and hot yoga
on too-little sleep is how groin pulls happen.

148
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:17,380
- Aren't you supposed to be on vacation?
- Yeah. I am.

149
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,450
But you need my help.

150
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,680
Well,I can't exactly
bring the trailer with me.

151
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,370
All right. I get it.What do you got?

152
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,650
All right,I got a cat.
It's not a lion or a tiger,

153
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,950
but it's not a house cat either.
It's something in-between.

154
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,490
- Like an alley cat?
- Yeah.

155
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,820
Klaustreich. Total jerks.

156
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,670
Women love them, but it never ends well.

157
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,450
- Isn't that always the way?
- I don't know.

158
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:47,420
This could be a,uh, spousal situation.

159
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,020
No surprise there.

160
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:52,060
Molly,my girlfriend from high
school,left me for a Klaustreich,

161
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,960
so I might be a wee
bit biled up about them.

162
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:58,130
He told her he loved
her. He got her pregnant.

163
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:01,850
She ended up delivering
his litter at prom.

164
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:03,640
Her parents were not thrilled.

165
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,600
Um,hate to say it,but getting pregnant
in high school isn't exactly unheard of.

166
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,990
Well,maybe not that part,

167
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,640
but when she told her folks who the
father was,they went to the cops.

168
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,250
He paid her a little visit
before he skipped town.

169
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:21,780
As a good-bye,he slashed her face.

170
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,730
I hope they caught him.

171
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:29,020
Well,they didn't,but...

172
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:32,270
Somebody did.

173
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,870
All right,well, sorry
for calling so late.

174
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,670
Hey,don't worry about it.Especially
if it's about a Klaustreich.

175
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:41,490
Sleep with one eye open.

176
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:48,820
Now,I have the whole day planned.

177
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:49,660
Tell me.

178
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,920
Well,it starts with a trip into
beautiful downtown whispering pines...

179
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,460
- Okay.
- Where,uh,

180
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:57,470
you can drag me through as many
antique shops as you want to

181
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,670
until I pass out or
beg for you for mercy.

182
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,680
- Really,you want to do that?
- Well,not really.

183
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,260
But...I need to pick up some
groceries for our special dinner.

184
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,380
Ooh,sounds intriguing.

185
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:12,090
You have no idea.

186
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,110
6:00. Bring the money.

187
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,120
Can we do it later? It'll be hard for me
to get out after what happened yesterday.

188
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:31,090
Look,Robin, I'm taking a real chance here.The
sooner we get out, the further you'll get.

189
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,950
Excuse me.

190
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:43,090
Hi. I'm Juliette. I'm actually staying
at the house up on the hill behind yours.

191
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,500
I'm Robin.

192
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:48,820
You're lucky you live
in such a beautiful town.

193
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,210
We don't get away from
Portland that much.

194
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:55,450
I'm a vet,so weekends are bad, and Nick's
a cop,so he's busy pretty much all the time.

195
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,490
Your husband's a police officer?

196
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:02,110
Detective actually,
and he's not my husband.

197
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,110
Not yet,anyway.

198
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,950
Excuse me.

199
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,570
It's okay. I got it.It's
okay. Happens all the time.

200
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:08,980
Robin...I'm sure this
is none of my business,

201
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:12,420
but if you're in some kind of
trouble,or you need help of any kind...

202
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,300
Robin.

203
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,710
It's time to go.

204
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:59,100
Look,I really appreciate you
helping me out with all this.

205
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:03,430
Well,you never know when I
might need a discount on...

206
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:06,250
Tincture of prickle poppy?

207
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,730
Yeah,that's for,um, romantic stamina.

208
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:12,020
Oh. Well...

209
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,740
No wonder I didn't know what it was.

210
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,280
Found something.

211
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,050
Oh,maybe it's money.

212
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:26,030
It's not money.Passports
from Brazil,Canada.

213
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:30,140
And Germany. Wonder who they belong to.

214
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:32,780
Isn't that your brother?

215
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:37,110
- In all of them?
- Yeah,with different names.

216
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,210
What was he,a spy or something?

217
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,730
I have no idea.

218
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,550
Hey,Nick,I thought a vacation
for you kind of meant,you know...

219
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,880
Vacation for me too.

220
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,520
Look,I'm sorry.You know,this wasn't
part of my weekend plans either.

221
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,170
Hey,how was hot yoga? You
pull a groin or anything?

222
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,190
My groin is fine. Thank you.

223
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,690
All right,I'll make this
fast,but it is a weird one.

224
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,390
Some kind of bird-like creature.

225
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:08,820
Big golden eyes,uh,golden plumage...

226
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,880
- Is this a joke?
- No joke.

227
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:13,410
That sounds like a Seltenvogel,if
they weren't extinct.

228
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,390
- A Seltenvogel?
- Sounds like it.

229
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,150
- Are you with someone?
- Yeah,I'm with Rosalee.

230
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,930
I'm helping her out in the shop,but
let's get back to the Seltenvogel.

231
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,270
In ancient times, they
were highly-valued,

232
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:26,070
usually kept prisoner,you
know,like a concubine or a parakeet.

233
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,400
Well,what made them so valuable?

234
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:31,710
Once in their life,a
Seltenvogel produces this kind of

235
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,180
large,glandular thing.

236
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:37,400
I think it's called an "Unbezahlbar."

237
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,470
Easy for you to say. She
thinks it's called an...

238
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,800
"Unbezahlbar."

239
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:44,230
- "Unbezahlbar."
- My brother has a book.

240
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,700
Hang on,we're looking.

241
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,380
Here it is.

242
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,740
- Oh,here.
- Okay.

243
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:58,070
Uh,it is a dense mineral deposit
which grows in the throat sack.

244
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,080
It develops something like an egg.

245
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:06,570
Anyway,um,yeah,if the stone gets
too big, it needs to be delivered,

246
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,230
and the trick is getting it out intact,

247
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,850
because if it's damaged,
it's,you know,worthless.

248
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:13,840
Okay,but what made them so valuable?

249
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,590
Well,it's unbelievably
rare,for one thing,

250
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,160
but it's also supposed to be mostly
gold,if you believe in that kind of thing.

251
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:22,690
What,and I'm guessing a
Klaustreich would know this too?

252
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,240
Oh,man,this is the woman
who's with the Klaustreich?

253
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,490
- Yeah.
- Listen.

254
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,750
If he's anything like the guy
I went to high school with,

255
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:32,150
as soon as he gets what he wants,she
is going to be in big trouble,man.

256
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,250
And when I say big trouble, I
mean she's gonna get plucked.Okay?

257
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,600
- Big time.
- Thanks.

258
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,840
You scared me.

259
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,820
That's a compliment,coming from you.

260
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,350
What are you doing here?

261
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:29,320
It appears Detective Griffin
is...Taking favorably to your cookies.

262
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,330
He's left a dozen voicemail
messages as of this morning,

263
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,580
if you call that a response.

264
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:39,670
And he threatened your
visitor last night too.

265
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:42,320
I wish he'd done more than threaten him.

266
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:47,530
Do you realize that Peter suggested that we
sleep together to ensure our authenticity?

267
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:50,960
He's lucky I let him leave in one piece.

268
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:55,370
The next time Griffin
calls, I want you to answer.

269
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:58,270
It's time to move this up a notch.

270
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:05,540
I hope you realize how
dangerous this is...For me.

271
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,050
You can handle it.

272
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:11,560
Let's hope so.

273
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:15,580
Just be... Who you aren't.

274
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:30,300
I can't believe you remember
what we had on our first date.

275
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,540
How could I forget that?That was the most
expensive date I've ever had in my life.

276
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,580
Not if you add in what
happened afterward.

277
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,460
Ooh. Yeah,or after that.

278
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,410
- She has your card, she knows she can call us.
- Right.

279
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,650
We did everything we could do.

280
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,820
You're right.We did,now back to us.

281
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,440
You should try the tea. It's new.

282
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,860
I'm not so thirsty.

283
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,420
Hey.

284
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:45,390
What,right now?

285
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:50,810
Uh,no.Okay,no.I'll,uh...
I'll be right over.

286
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:55,840
- Who was that?
- It was Kevin. He needs a hand.

287
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,690
He,uh... he hit a deer.
His car's in a ditch.

288
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:03,560
He's waiting for,uh,a
tow, and needs a ride home.

289
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,600
Got no idea how long this is gonna take.

290
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,560
Okay.

291
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,040
You do the crabs, I'll finish chopping.

292
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:33,020
Ooh,thanks.

293
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,050
- Hey.
- What?

294
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,600
- Gotta melt the butter.
- Right.

295
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:01,100
- That's weird.
- Glad you said it first.

296
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:06,040
- She didn't call.
- Maybe she couldn't.

297
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:09,330
- What about the crab?
- It can wait.

298
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:14,340
Okay. I'll,uh, just check
to see if she's okay.

299
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,910
- You want me to go with you?
- No,no.

300
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,570
If it's something serious,
it's better you stay here.

301
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,220
I know. Go.

302
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,120
- Hello?
- Adalind.

303
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,440
- Yes?
- Uh,it's Hank.

304
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:38,600
I guess I just expected to
get your voicemail again.

305
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,590
I've been completely off the radar.

306
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,700
Work's been crazy.
18-hour days. I'm so sorry.

307
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,580
I was just actually just
about to call you back.

308
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:48,920
That's okay. Really.

309
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,510
It's just good to hear your voice.

310
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,780
It's good to hear your voice too.

311
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,850
I was thinking,uh, maybe
we can see each other.

312
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:04,000
I mean,whenever is good for you.

313
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,370
I'm free for dinner tomorrow night.

314
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:10,880
Tomorrow. Perfect.

315
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,550
Um,I'll pick a place and call you back.

316
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:19,490
- How's 7:00 sound?
- Sounds lucky,can't wait.

317
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,610
Robin?

318
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,630
Hey,hurry up,we got to go.

319
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,110
Hi.

320
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,900
He was on time, but
you're a little too late.

321
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,700
- You killed him.
- No.

322
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:23,090
You killed him.You should have
never involved him in our business.

323
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,180
*****

324
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:14,280
- Sheriff Munson.
- Sheriff.

325
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,470
Detective Burkhardt,Portland pd.

326
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,090
I'm the one who called 911
about the Steinkellners.

327
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,890
What's the problem?

328
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:22,950
There's been a homicide.

329
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,040
Homicide? Are you kidding me?

330
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,620
No. Victim's name is Gary Cardero.

331
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:31,270
At least,I think that's
him, he's torn up pretty bad.

332
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,180
Where are you?

333
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:34,100
I'm on what looks to be a
forest service road about

334
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,740
a mile or a half-mile behind
the Steinkellner's house.

335
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,550
I'm coming out.

336
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:57,460
Hey! Get out!

337
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:01,710
Get... Robin! Get
out!This is your fault!

338
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,540
- Yeah?
- Where are you?

339
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,320
I just saw him driving
her up to the house.

340
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:11,020
I'm on my way back.Just stay
in the house until I get there.

341
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:17,440
Get inside!

342
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:26,490
Timothy,please. I can't.We've
already done this once today.

343
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:29,980
Once is never enough when
you're expecting,sweetie.

344
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,040
Open up.

345
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:38,360
Okay. Okay,let's put a little...

346
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,520
A little weight on that baby.

347
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,150
Open.

348
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:12,440
Turn it off.

349
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:19,400
Yeah,you're a Klaustreich.
Now,turn it off.

350
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,400
It's gonna be okay.It's gonna
be okay.You're gonna be okay.

351
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:57,170
I'm gonna get you out of here.

352
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,560
Oh,my God,you poor
thing.What did he do to you?

353
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,360
He told me he loved me.

354
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:16,000
Let me get you a glass of water.

355
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:19,680
- You're a Grimm.
- Um,yeah.

356
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:21,400
Why are you helping me?

357
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:23,480
Uh, can we talk about this later?

358
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,490
- Okay.
- Yeah.

359
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:27,230
Look,I called the
sheriff, he's on his way.

360
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,010
What?

361
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:31,150
Yeah,he's pulling up
to the house right now.

362
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:38,180
The sheriff is Tim's cousin. He... he
knows all about this.He's part of it.

363
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:49,000
- Where is she?
- The guy from up the hill took her.

364
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,560
He was here. He had a gun.

365
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,230
- He's a cop.
- He's a Grimm.

366
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:56,610
- He wants her for himself.
- That's not gonna happen.

367
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,010
All right,we need to
get you out of here.

368
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:04,610
No,you don't understand.There's
only one road and they'll be on it.

369
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,810
They're coming.

370
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:11,150
Go after her.

371
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:15,370
- But what about you?
- I'll sneak outside and call state police.

372
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:17,710
- You've gotta help her,Nick.
- Oh,Juliette.

373
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:21,700
I know,but this is why you bought
it for me in the first place. Now,go.

374
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,650
Car's still here!

375
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,250
They gotta be around here somewhere.

376
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,680
Not gonna get far with
her in her condition.

377
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,540
Robin!

378
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,810
Robin!

379
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,550
Oh,man.

380
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:15,130
Robin...We gotta get you out of here.

381
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:16,490
It's time.

382
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:19,210
Oh. I don't know how to do this.

383
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:23,520
You have to...Take it out.

384
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:25,830
Okay.

385
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:38,160
- Hello?
- Rosalee?

386
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:40,470
Hey,Nick Burkhardt
here. I need your help.

387
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,870
- What's wrong?
- Well,I'm with...

388
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:46,160
Robin, the Seltenvogel.

389
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:49,210
Nick,you need to get that stone out
of her before it cuts off her airway.

390
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,410
- Yeah,I know,but how?
- Is that Nick?

391
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,670
He called you? You called her?

392
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,990
Can you guys do this
later? That girl needs help.

393
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:56,520
She says I need to take it out.

394
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:59,980
You grab the book. No,you... no,you need
to cut it out of her. Do you have a knife?

395
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:02,300
Uh,yeah,I do.

396
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:03,970
Okay,right here. Oh,boy.

397
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:08,450
Okay,the cut should be made vertically
along the widest point of the Unbezahlbar.

398
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:10,740
The... the skin should be pretty tight,

399
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:16,300
so you just need to press the knife through the
flesh until you feel the hard surface of the stone.

400
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,190
Okay.

401
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:31,130
- Nick? Update.
- Uh,a little busy here.

402
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:33,410
Oh,it says be really careful
not to cut the jugular.

403
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:34,520
Uh,not helping.

404
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:37,100
You want to get close,
but not too close.

405
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:40,500
- How will I know if I'm too close?
- Dude,you'll know. Tons of blood.

406
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:43,350
Trust me,it's not
pretty. I've been there.

407
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,550
Okay. Okay,okay. I
think I'm,uh... I'm done.

408
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:48,350
All right,now slip
your hands into the cut

409
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:54,070
and gently detach the Unbezahlbar from
the Faserig membrane holding it in place.

410
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:57,810
You should feel a slight
pop when it separates.

411
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,040
Okay.Okay,it popped.

412
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:11,040
Okay,that's great. Just,um...Just
simply lift it up and out.

413
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:12,950
Oh,God.

414
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,250
How is she?

415
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:43,870
She...Seems to be
breathing a lot better.

416
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:47,740
- I think she's gonna be okay.
- Nice goin',dude.

417
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:52,260
Hey,call me later,will you,when
this all calms down,okay?

418
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,320
I think this is yours.

419
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:03,330
I don't want it.

420
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:06,080
I never did.

421
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:10,800
Real nice job you did there.

422
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,940
Yeah,saved us a lot of trouble.

423
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:22,980
From what I understand,
if this thing breaks...

424
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,260
- It's worthless.
- Okay,and so are you,if you're dead.

425
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,440
All we want is the stone.

426
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:32,570
Yeah? How about a little catch?

427
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:35,250
No,no,n... Now,take it easy.

428
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:37,900
Look,we're not greedy,
we can cut you in.

429
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,950
Do you have any idea how
much that is worth to us?

430
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,970
Oh,really?

431
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:46,320
Are you insane?

432
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,770
Well,I'm in the woods, I just cut a golden
egg out of a girl's neck.You tell me.

433
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,550
Hey,sheriff.

434
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,600
Juliette.

435
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:06,240
Keep the gun on him.

436
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:41,850
Well,you know what they say,Tim.

437
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:47,660
In order to make an omelet,
you got to break a few eggs.

438
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,480
Okay,look,I know that this weekend
didn't turn out the way I planned.

439
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,690
And,uh,I think the thing of it is,

440
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,970
you kind of have to make
your own perfect moments.

441
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:02,870
So...

442
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,420
Juliette,will you be my wife?

443
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:32,140
I can't.

444
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:37,960
I love you so much.

445
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:45,770
And I really,really want
to marry you someday.

446
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,750
But I can't right now.

447
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:52,360
- Because of what? I'm a cop? Is that...
- It's not because of your job.

448
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,950
It's... you.

449
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:59,730
I feel like you've been
keeping things from me.

450
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:03,580
You've been so closed off.

451
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:08,680
I know how hard Aunt
Marie's death was for you.

452
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:18,430
But until you can let
me back in again...

453
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:21,720
I can't say yes.

454
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:55,800
