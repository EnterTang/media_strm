- SIREN WAILS
- 'Octonauts, to your stations!'

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,380
Barnacles!

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,820
Kwazii!

4
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,420
Peso!

5
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,060
- Explore!
- Rescue!
- Protect!

6
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,380
Octonauts!

7
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,500
Ach, this spyglass is no good.

8
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:55,300
It's supposed to see things far away but I can't make out that shape.

9
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,740
We're so far down, it's dark as night.

10
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,300
Good thing the octoscope can see in the dark.

11
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,700
- Can you give us a better picture of what's out there?
- Aye-aye, Captain.

12
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:17,940
- It looks like a ship of some kind.
- Oh, shiver me whiskers!

13
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:23,260
Unless I miss me guess, that's the pirate shipwreck of Calico Jack!

14
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,780
TOGETHER: Calico who?!

15
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,620
Calico Jack. He was my grandfather

16
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,580
and the finest cat pirate ever to roam the seven seas.

17
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,540
He had a golden spyglass.

18
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:40,060
The spyglass was passed down from one member of me family to the next.

19
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,340
Before it could pass down to me,

20
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,220
Calico Jack's ship sank in the North Atlantic Ocean.

21
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,420
That golden spyglass sank with it.

22
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,460
The North Atlantic Ocean? But...that's where we are now.

23
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,220
Kwazii, do you really think

24
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,660
that could be the pirate ship of Calico Jack out there?

25
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,100
- Aye-aye, Captain.
- Then, let's go and investigate.

26
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,220
Kwazii, sound the octo-alert.

27
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,780
- Yow!
- SIREN WAILS

28
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,140
Octonauts, to the launch bay.

29
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,700
Octonauts, there's a mysterious ship out there

30
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,340
that may have belonged to Kwazii's grandfather, Calico Jack.

31
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,740
Our mission is to explore the shipwreck

32
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,740
and help Kwazii find his grandfather's spyglass.

33
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,020
Peso, Dashi, Kwazii, let's go.

34
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,980
- Tweak, open the octo-hatch.
- Right away, Captain.

35
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,700
Can't you go any faster, Captain?

36
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,900
Kwazii, that shipwreck has been down there for years.

37
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,140
It'll still be there in a few minutes.

38
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,780
Oh!

39
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,060
Look, everyone.

40
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,300
There it is.

41
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,100
Well, Kwazii, do you think it's Calico Jack's ship?

42
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:17,300
That's got to be a carving of your grandfather. He even looks like you.

43
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,740
Let's go inside! Yow!

44
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,700
Eh?

45
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:31,260
- Hold on, Kwazii.
- Hey?
- This may have been a pirate ship once,

46
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,300
but now she's home to hundreds of plants and animals.

47
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:39,340
Octonauts, be extra careful. We don't want to disturb anything.

48
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,380
- TOGETHER: Aye-aye, Captain.
- Have you got that, Kwazii?

49
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,540
Kwazii?

50
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:48,180
I wonder where that spyglass might be.

51
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,940
Yow! Spiky sea urchins!

52
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,500
Yow!

53
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,460
Ye-hah!

54
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,940
Huh?

55
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:13,220
A little seaweed isn't going to keep me from that spyglass.

56
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,420
Hah!

57
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,140
Oh!

58
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,780
Ah!

59
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,580
Shiver me whiskers!

60
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,780
Me grandfather's treasure chest!

61
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,420
I just know that spyglass is inside.

62
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,500
The spyglass!

63
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,940
HISS!

64
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,340
Aggh!

65
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,100
Agggh! Ugh!

66
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,420
Kwazii, what happened?

67
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:04,540
I got slimed before I could grab the spyglass.

68
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,540
HE SNIFFS Who goes there?

69
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:12,140
We can't see, but we can still smell you and hear you, dagnabbit!

70
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,620
Uh-oh, looks like this is slime eel territory.

71
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,100
Get off our property or I'll slime you again!

72
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,980
- Sorry, Kwazii, we've got to go.
- One!

73
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,820
- But what about the spyglass?
- Just leave it, Kwazii.

74
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,980
Two!

75
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,060
No! It was me grandfather's, and it should be mine!

76
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:33,820
- But, Kwazii... - Three! OK, boys, let them have it!

77
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,180
HISS-S-S! HISS!

78
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,620
ALL: Agh!

79
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,060
Ppt!

80
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,820
- Ugh!
- Agh!

81
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,140
Ughhh...

82
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,860
Agh, huh...

83
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,980
Ppt!

84
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,980
Give me two seconds and I promise I'll be...

85
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,500
SPLAT! SPLAT! SPLAT!

86
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,540
Miaow...

87
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:04,660
..And then we ran in and Kwazii was covered in this disgusting slime!

88
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,100
Fascinating.

89
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,140
A single slime eel can produce a bucket of slime in no time.

90
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,940
Tell me about it...

91
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,980
That's the slime eel's way of protecting itself and its home -

92
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,660
especially since it can't see.

93
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,340
There certainly were a lot of slime eels protecting that spyglass.

94
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:27,500
- Not to mention spiky sea urchins...
- And tangly seaweed.

95
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,220
Sorry, Kwazii, it's too dangerous to go back.

96
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,540
What would a slime eel want with a spyglass anyway?

97
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,260
Ohh, I'm going to bed.

98
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,460
..Calico Jack...spyglass...

99
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,740
It's mine...mine...MINE!

100
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,220
THE SPYGLASS IS MINE!

101
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,900
DOOR OPENS, ENGINE STARTS >

102
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,100
Oh! Kwazii.

103
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:05,380
This time I'm not leaving without that spyglass.

104
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,580
Oh!

105
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,060
ALL SNORE

106
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,500
Um...

107
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,660
Me grandfather's spyglass!

108
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,580
At last!

109
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,740
- Huh!
- >

110
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,340
ALL SNORE

111
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,620
- Haha! I made it!
- DOINK!

112
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,380
CREEAAAK! THUNK!

113
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,020
DOING!

114
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,020
Hey, what's all the ruckus?

115
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,340
Ugggh!

116
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,420
Oh, great(!) You again.

117
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:02,060
So, you're back for some more, eh?

118
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,300
- Kwazii!
- Kwazii!

119
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,860
I finally had me grandfather's spyglass,

120
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,300
till this beam fell down and trapped me.

121
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,300
Agh!

122
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,620
I can't move it without bringing the whole ship down.

123
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:20,380
Didn't we warn you to clear out of here and never come back?

124
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,500
Ah, you caught me, slime eel.

125
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,660
I suppose you're going to slime me again. Go ahead!

126
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:31,380
That's it! You're right!

127
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,700
Ahem!

128
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,420
Go ahead! Slime him! I dare you.

129
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,380
- What?! But...
- My pleasure!

130
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,500
SPLAT!

131
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,180
You call THAT sliming someone? Ha, you missed him!

132
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,500
- Ah, well, I can't see, remember?
- Captain?

133
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:52,660
Slime makes Kwazii's tail slippery and we can pull him loose.

134
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,940
Ohhh... Try a little lower next time.

135
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,620
Peso, what are you saying?

136
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,660
SPLAT!

137
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,300
Just a little lower...

138
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,500
You asked for it!

139
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,700
SPLAT! SPLAT!

140
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,980
Great work! Let's pull!

141
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,100
I'm free!

142
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,580
Thanks, matey!

143
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,740
And thanks, slime eel!

144
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,380
At last! Me grandfather's spyglass!

145
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,740
And it's all mine!

146
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,100
Huh?

147
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,060
There's all kinds of plants and animals in there.

148
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:34,940
Looks like this spyglass has become home to many different creatures.

149
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,740
Aye.

150
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,380
Back for more, eh?

151
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,100
Wait! Just a minute.

152
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,340
This spyglass has always been passed down in my family.

153
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:54,620
But now, I'm passing it on to you and these little creatures.

154
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:01,380
- Ah, that's mighty kind of you.
- Take good care of it.

155
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:06,780
Oh, we will! And, um, sorry about the slime.

156
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,540
No, go on! Get out of here.

157
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:16,220
And after all this time, I finally had the spyglass in me own paws.

158
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,300
But when I saw those creatures, I had to put it back.

159
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,340
Miaow...

160
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,340
Kwazii, you did the right thing.

161
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:27,900
You can tell everyone you discovered Calico Jack's shipwreck.

162
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,140
Besides, it's not like you didn't get any souvenirs.

163
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,740
Huh?

164
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,380
