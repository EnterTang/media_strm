1
00:00:02,968 --> 00:00:04,334
AHHH!

2
00:00:04,334 --> 00:00:06,400
AFTER 10,000 YEARS, I'M FREE!

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,667
ITS TIME TO CONQUER EARTH!

4
00:00:09,667 --> 00:00:10,634
ALPHA, RITA'S ESCAPED!

5
00:00:10,634 --> 00:00:15,634
RECRUIT A TEAM OF
TEENAGERS WITH ATTITUDE!

6
00:00:20,968 --> 00:00:25,934
# GO, GO, POWER RANGERS #

7
00:00:26,467 --> 00:00:31,367
# GO, GO, POWER RANGERS #

8
00:00:31,367 --> 00:00:33,767
# GO, GO, POWER RANGERS #

9
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:38,767
# MIGHTY MORPHIN POWER RANGERS #

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,560
# POWER RANGERS #

11
00:00:50,067 --> 00:00:51,627
# POWER RANGERS #

12
00:00:54,501 --> 00:00:56,467
# GO, GO, POWER RANGERS #

13
00:00:56,467 --> 00:01:01,467
# YOU MIGHTY MORPHIN
POWER RANGERS #

14
00:01:03,601 --> 00:01:08,067
Woman: EVERYBODY TAKE
THEIR PLACES, PLEASE.

15
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:09,667
IT'S A VIDEO PROJECT--

16
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:11,667
BULK, THE WORLD'S GREATEST GUY.

17
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:12,167
TAKE 32.

18
00:01:12,167 --> 00:01:17,167
I HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED
THIS NOTABLE CLASS.

19
00:01:17,634 --> 00:01:22,601
TAKE YOUR SEATS NOW, PLEASE.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,267
THAT WAS MISS APPLEBY

21
00:01:27,267 --> 00:01:30,267
WHO CAN'T WAIT FOR ME
TO SIT DOWN.

22
00:01:30,267 --> 00:01:32,267
SHE REALLY IS A LOVELY TEACHER.

23
00:01:32,267 --> 00:01:35,400
( chuckling )

24
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,467
LIGHT'S NO GOOD.

25
00:01:36,467 --> 00:01:38,300
COULD YOU? LEFT...

26
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,367
NO, MY LEFT.

27
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:41,367
GO TO YOUR LEFT.

28
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:42,868
BACK, BACK IT UP.

29
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:47,868
RIGHT... RIGHT THERE.

30
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,300
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, BULK.

31
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:58,300
I'LL... EDIT IT OUT LATER.

32
00:02:01,367 --> 00:02:05,267
IT'S TIME FOR OUR FIRST
VIDEO PROJECT TODAY.

33
00:02:05,267 --> 00:02:05,987
TRINI.

34
00:02:08,801 --> 00:02:10,701
MY VIDEO PROJECT IS CALLED

35
00:02:10,701 --> 00:02:15,701
POLLUTION PROBLEMS
IN ANGEL GROVE.

36
00:02:18,434 --> 00:02:22,267
Trini: Pollution... It exists
even here in beautiful Angel Grove.

37
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:26,033
Despite all of the attention
focused on the environment

38
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:31,033
in the past few years, we still
have a problem with trash

39
00:02:31,334 --> 00:02:33,634
dirty air, and polluted water.

40
00:02:33,634 --> 00:02:34,133
Heavy industry

41
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:36,033
a major source of contaminants

42
00:02:36,033 --> 00:02:37,534
has made progress recently

43
00:02:37,534 --> 00:02:41,033
but there is still a lot
that needs to be done.

44
00:02:41,033 --> 00:02:44,834
We must take care not to destroy
nature's delicate balance

45
00:02:44,834 --> 00:02:49,734
for the sake of the animals
and for our very world

46
00:02:49,734 --> 00:02:52,067
because
if the animals disappear...

47
00:02:52,067 --> 00:02:54,367
ultimately, so will we.

48
00:02:54,367 --> 00:02:59,367
The time to act is now.

49
00:03:01,467 --> 00:03:03,234
VERY NICE JOB, TRINI.

50
00:03:03,234 --> 00:03:07,267
POLLUTION IS A SERIOUS CONCERN
TO OUR SOCIETY.

51
00:03:07,267 --> 00:03:08,767
Billy:
I COULDN'T AGREE MORE.

52
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:12,033
I'M DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT
THE ECOLOGICAL RAMIFICATIONS

53
00:03:12,033 --> 00:03:14,067
OF OZONE DEPLETION,
ACID RAIN

54
00:03:14,067 --> 00:03:17,033
DEFORESTATION,
AND THE LOSS OF OUR TOPSOILS.

55
00:03:17,033 --> 00:03:17,868
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

56
00:03:17,868 --> 00:03:21,200
SO WHAT CAN WE DO
TO HELP BEAUTIFY OUR CITY?

57
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,968
I WANT TO START
A CLEAN-UP CLUB.

58
00:03:22,968 --> 00:03:25,467
ONE DAY A WEEK,
WE CAN DO SOME RECYCLING

59
00:03:25,467 --> 00:03:29,267
CLEAN UP MAJOR TRAILS, OR EVEN
COUNT ENDANGERED ANIMALS.

60
00:03:29,267 --> 00:03:31,100
- YEAH.
- COUNT ME IN.

61
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,934
SOUNDS COOL.

62
00:03:32,934 --> 00:03:33,868
TOTALLY.

63
00:03:33,868 --> 00:03:36,300
Rita:
A CLEAN-UP CLUB, EH?

64
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,868
WE'LL GIVE THEM SOMETHING
TO CLEAN.

65
00:03:40,868 --> 00:03:42,367
CALL FINSTER'S POLLUTICORN.

66
00:03:42,367 --> 00:03:46,767
THE POLLUTICORN WILL MAKE
SUCH A MESS OF THEIR PLANET

67
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:49,634
THEY'LL NEVER GET IT CLEANED UP!

68
00:03:49,634 --> 00:03:50,501
SCORPINA! GOLDAR!

69
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:53,234
MAKE SURE THIS WORKS. NOW GO!

70
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:54,134
YES, MY QUEEN.
YES!

71
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,167
( exaggerated karate yell )

72
00:04:06,334 --> 00:04:10,067
THAT WAS VERY GOOD...

73
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:12,167
BUT WATCH THIS.

74
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:16,067
( exaggerated karate yell )

75
00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:20,033
NOT VERY PRACTICAL,
BUT BIG-TIME POINTS FOR STYLE.

76
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:21,367
HOW'S IT GOING, HUH?

77
00:04:21,367 --> 00:04:24,868
GOOD. TWO MORE,
AND WE'RE DONE.

78
00:04:24,868 --> 00:04:26,118
GOOD.

79
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,300
VERY GOOD, BILLY.

80
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,300
THANKS. I'M USING
A SPECIAL MIXTURE

81
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,801
OF TOTALLY ORGANIC PAINT

82
00:04:34,801 --> 00:04:38,167
PIGMENTED WITH VARIOUS
NATURAL SUBSTANCES.

83
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:42,100
A LITTLE TO THE LEFT.

84
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,567
BACK A LITTLE BIT TO THE RIGHT.

85
00:04:46,567 --> 00:04:47,133
PERFECT.

86
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:48,634
I WANT TO THANK
YOU GUYS

87
00:04:48,634 --> 00:04:52,133
FOR REALLY HELPING ME OUT
WITH THIS RECYCLING STUFF.

88
00:04:52,133 --> 00:04:54,100
THAT'S WHAT
THE CLEAN-UP CLUB IS FOR.

89
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,100
NOW, LET'S GET OVER
TO THAT FIELD NEAR THE PARK

90
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,067
AND PICK UP TRASH,
SHALL WE?

91
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:00,601
TAKE CARE, GUYS.

92
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:03,534
BULK, THE WORLD'S
GREATEST GUY,

93
00:05:03,534 --> 00:05:05,033
SCENE 42.

94
00:05:05,033 --> 00:05:06,601
WORKING OUT.

95
00:05:06,601 --> 00:05:08,601
THIS IS WHERE I TRAIN.

96
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:13,534
PUMPING UP
IS IMPORTANT TO ME.

97
00:05:13,534 --> 00:05:15,100
HEY, BULK?

98
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,400
YOU PROMISED I COULD
DO THE SCENE WITH YOU.

99
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,701
WHO'S GOING TO RUN
THE CAMERA, STUPID?

100
00:05:20,701 --> 00:05:24,701
HEY, ERNIE, YOU WANT
TO FILM US WORKING OUT?

101
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:26,000
YOU TWO?

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,067
WORKING OUT?

103
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:31,067
JUST RUN THE CAMERA,
OKAY?

104
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:36,067
OH, THIS OUGHT TO BE FUN.

105
00:05:36,067 --> 00:05:41,067
GUYS, THIS IS REALLY SAD.

106
00:05:41,334 --> 00:05:42,367
LOOK AT THIS MESS.

107
00:05:42,367 --> 00:05:43,868
THIS IS TERRIBLE.

108
00:05:43,868 --> 00:05:44,367
I CANNOT BELIEVE

109
00:05:44,367 --> 00:05:47,767
PEOPLE WOULD RUIN
SUCH A BEAUTIFUL PLACE.

110
00:05:47,767 --> 00:05:52,767
LET ME TAKE A SOIL SAMPLE.

111
00:05:53,734 --> 00:05:54,701
COMPLETELY POLLUTED.

112
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:56,200
THIS KIND OF
WANTON DISREGARD

113
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,701
IS SO DESTRUCTIVE
TO SUCH A FRAGILE ECOSYSTEM.

114
00:05:59,701 --> 00:06:01,067
AND IT STINKS.

115
00:06:01,067 --> 00:06:01,917
TIME TO GET BUSY.

116
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
LOOKS LIKE OUR CLUB
REALLY CLEANED UP.

117
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,868
IT LOOKS TOTALLY FAR OUT
AND FUNKY DOWN THE DRAIN.

118
00:06:45,868 --> 00:06:47,367
VERY SUCCESSFUL VENTURE.

119
00:06:47,367 --> 00:06:48,400
IT WAS FUN TOO.

120
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,400
LET'S DO THAT SECTION THERE

121
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,901
AND THEN WE'LL HEAD DOWN
TO THE RECYCLING CENTER.

122
00:06:52,901 --> 00:06:54,101
ALL RIGHT.

123
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,167
IT'S ALMOST TIME.

124
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,567
( evil laughter )

125
00:07:00,567 --> 00:07:02,901
ANOTHER BRILLIANT PLAN,
MY QUEEN.

126
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:03,901
NOW I SHALL SEND PUTTIES

127
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:08,901
TO SOFTEN THEM UP
FOR THE POLLUTICORN.

128
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,334
THIS IS GOING
TO MAKE ME LOOK GOOD.

129
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:16,868
THANKS FOR ALL YOUR HELP,
GOODY-GOODS.

130
00:07:16,868 --> 00:07:18,428
( chuckling )

131
00:07:22,501 --> 00:07:25,667
BULK, THE WORLD'S GREATEST GUY

132
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:26,734
TAKE 53.

133
00:07:26,734 --> 00:07:30,000
I PICKED UP
ALL THIS TRASH MYSELF.

134
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,133
BEAUTIFUL, BABE, BUT THIS WAY.

135
00:07:32,133 --> 00:07:32,853
RIGHT.

136
00:07:34,234 --> 00:07:35,167
THE OTHER RIGHT.

137
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,434
OKAY, TO MY RIGHT.

138
00:07:37,434 --> 00:07:38,754
( yelling )

139
00:07:41,601 --> 00:07:42,551
GET ME OUT OF HERE!

140
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:03,167
WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE
JUST DUMP THEIR TRASH LIKE THIS?

141
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:04,601
POLLUTANTS, LIKE THAT!

142
00:08:04,601 --> 00:08:08,667
Trini:
OH, NO! PUTTIES!

143
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:11,534
NOW WE GOT SOMETHING ELSE
TO CLEAN UP.

144
00:08:11,534 --> 00:08:16,534
Tommy:
LET'S BAG THEM!

145
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,801
SO MUCH FOR THEM.

146
00:09:30,801 --> 00:09:32,267
YEAH.

147
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:33,587
( roaring )

148
00:09:37,234 --> 00:09:39,567
YO, MONSTER HORSE
SKY HIGH.

149
00:09:39,567 --> 00:09:40,567
FLYING IN FAST.

150
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:42,534
THAT'S ONE
REAL NIGHTMARE.

151
00:09:42,534 --> 00:09:44,167
IT'S MORPHIN TIME!

152
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,000
MASTODON!

153
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,834
PTERODACTYL!

154
00:09:46,834 --> 00:09:47,667
TRICERATOPS!

155
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:48,934
SABER-TOOTHED TIGER!

156
00:09:48,934 --> 00:09:51,400
TYRANNOSAURUS!

157
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,080
POWER RANGERS!

158
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:02,517
POWER WINDS BLOW!

159
00:10:06,634 --> 00:10:08,601
( all yelling )

160
00:10:08,601 --> 00:10:10,667
YOU GUYS OKAY?

161
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:11,634
WE'VE GOT TO STOP HIM

162
00:10:11,634 --> 00:10:16,567
BEFORE HE POLLUTES
EVERYTHING IN SIGHT.

163
00:10:16,567 --> 00:10:17,467
OH, MAN, WHAT NOW?

164
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:23,701
OKAY.

165
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:28,701
NO. I WILL TAKE CARE
OF THESE IRRITANTS.

166
00:10:37,067 --> 00:10:39,868
IT DOESN'T EVEN FEEL
OUR ATTACKS.

167
00:10:39,868 --> 00:10:40,901
I LIKE HIS STYLE.

168
00:10:40,901 --> 00:10:45,901
I'M GOING TO DESTROY YOU
AND YOUR MISERABLE PLANET.

169
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:52,300
Rita:
THAT'S THE WAY, POLLUTICORN.

170
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:57,300
I'M SO DEVIOUS, IT'S DELICIOUS.

171
00:10:58,467 --> 00:10:59,934
THAT HORSE-THING'S
TOO MUCH.

172
00:10:59,934 --> 00:11:04,901
THIS MONSTER MAY PROVE DIFFICULT
FOR YOU TO DEFEAT, RANGERS.

173
00:11:04,901 --> 00:11:06,434
BILLY, HELP ALPHA

174
00:11:06,434 --> 00:11:09,534
WITH A SITUATION ANALYSIS.

175
00:11:09,534 --> 00:11:10,567
YES, SIR.

176
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:13,901
DATA PRINTOUT
COMING UP.

177
00:11:13,901 --> 00:11:15,200
WHAT'S UP
WITH THIS MONSTER?

178
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,667
IT'S ALL PART
OF RITA'S LATEST PLAN

179
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:19,968
TO DESTROY THE EARTH.

180
00:11:19,968 --> 00:11:21,834
OBSERVE THE VIEWING GLOBE.

181
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:23,567
RITA HAS CREATED THIS MONSTER

182
00:11:23,567 --> 00:11:26,400
TO COVER THE EARTH
WITH POLLUTION.

183
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,968
WE CAN'T LET
THAT HAPPEN.

184
00:11:27,968 --> 00:11:31,968
THERE'S GOT TO BE A WAY
TO STOP THAT THING.

185
00:11:31,968 --> 00:11:33,133
YEAH, BUT HOW?

186
00:11:33,133 --> 00:11:34,133
AY-YI-YI-YI-YI!

187
00:11:34,133 --> 00:11:36,000
WHOA!

188
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,567
ALPHA.

189
00:11:36,567 --> 00:11:39,567
OH, ALPHA,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

190
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:41,127
ARE YOU OKAY?

191
00:11:46,501 --> 00:11:48,868
MY ANALYSIS SHOWS
THAT THE POLLUTICORN

192
00:11:48,868 --> 00:11:51,834
DERIVES ITS POWERS
FROM ITS HORN.

193
00:11:51,834 --> 00:11:52,400
GOOD WORK, BILLY.

194
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,968
I WILL BRING IT UP
ON THE VIEWING GLOBE.

195
00:11:56,968 --> 00:11:57,968
THE POLLUTICORN

196
00:11:57,968 --> 00:12:01,834
IS ATTACKING
THE ANGEL GROVE RECYCLING PLANT.

197
00:12:01,834 --> 00:12:02,868
I can pollute

198
00:12:02,868 --> 00:12:04,400
your whole pathetic planet

199
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:09,067
faster than you can clean it up.

200
00:12:09,067 --> 00:12:11,801
WE CAN'T LET HIM
WRECK THAT FACTORY.

201
00:12:11,801 --> 00:12:14,434
IT'S MORPHIN TIME.

202
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:15,501
MASTODON.

203
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:16,667
PTERODACTYL.

204
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:17,501
TRICERATOPS.

205
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:18,767
SABER-TOOTHED TIGER.

206
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:21,968
TYRANNOSAURUS.

207
00:12:21,968 --> 00:12:23,288
( yelling )

208
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,734
YOU GUYS GET THEM.

209
00:12:27,734 --> 00:12:29,734
I'LL TAKE OUT
HORN-HEAD.

210
00:12:29,734 --> 00:12:34,734
ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT!

211
00:12:59,901 --> 00:13:04,868
GOT TO FIND A WAY
TO CHOP OFF THAT HORN.

212
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,834
FACE IT

213
00:13:08,834 --> 00:13:10,801
I'M TOO POWERFUL FOR YOU.

214
00:13:10,801 --> 00:13:11,734
BESIDES,

215
00:13:11,734 --> 00:13:15,367
YOUR FRIENDS ARE FINISHED.

216
00:13:15,367 --> 00:13:15,934
WAIT A MINUTE.

217
00:13:15,934 --> 00:13:17,934
I'VE GOT TO FINISH DESTROYING

218
00:13:17,934 --> 00:13:19,934
THIS RECYCLING PLANT FIRST.

219
00:13:19,934 --> 00:13:21,634
AW, SO MUCH TO POLLUTE

220
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,200
SO LITTLE TIME.

221
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,667
YOUR POLLUTING DAYS
ARE OVER, HORSEFACE.

222
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:26,934
I'M SENDING YOU

223
00:13:26,934 --> 00:13:27,784
BACK TO THE BARN.

224
00:13:38,334 --> 00:13:42,334
ALL RIGHT, SMOG-BREATH,
MY FRIENDS NEED HELP.

225
00:13:42,334 --> 00:13:47,334
I SUMMON THE POWER
OF THE DRAGON SHIELD.

226
00:14:03,234 --> 00:14:05,000
( crying )

227
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,267
I'LL GET YOU FOR THAT!

228
00:14:07,267 --> 00:14:12,267
SEE THE UNICORN GROW!

229
00:14:16,434 --> 00:14:17,874
( growling )

230
00:14:20,868 --> 00:14:25,834
WE NEED DINOSAUR POWER NOW!

231
00:14:48,133 --> 00:14:51,901
TOXIC WINDS BLOW!

232
00:14:51,901 --> 00:14:53,341
( laughing )

233
00:14:59,734 --> 00:15:00,801
CLEAN THAT.

234
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:03,033
WE'RE GETTING WRECKED, GUYS.

235
00:15:03,033 --> 00:15:07,234
WE NEED THE POWER SWORD!

236
00:15:07,234 --> 00:15:10,234
# GO, GO, POWER RANGERS #

237
00:15:10,234 --> 00:15:11,400
HUH?

238
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,868
UH-OH.

239
00:15:12,868 --> 00:15:13,718
LET'S FINISH HIM!

240
00:15:20,934 --> 00:15:23,634
# GO, GO, POWER RANGERS #

241
00:15:23,634 --> 00:15:28,634
# YOU MIGHTY
MORPHIN POWER RANGERS. #

242
00:15:29,434 --> 00:15:31,300
OH, SUCH A HEADACHE.

243
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:36,300
NEVER FEAR, SOMEDAY WE'LL
MAKE THOSE POWER RANGERS PAY.

244
00:15:37,567 --> 00:15:39,801
Man:
This bulletin just in.

245
00:15:39,801 --> 00:15:40,801
We've just gotten word

246
00:15:40,801 --> 00:15:43,300
that once again
the amazing Power Rangers

247
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,300
have saved our town
and the world

248
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,367
from one of Rita Repulsa's
lethal monsters.

249
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:52,234
After a lengthy battle,
the Power Rangers

250
00:15:52,234 --> 00:15:55,033
and their Zords
defeated the beast

251
00:15:55,033 --> 00:15:57,601
just before it attacked
Angel Grove.

252
00:15:57,601 --> 00:15:59,100
No people
were reported injured.

253
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,267
How long will we be safe
from Rita Repulsa

254
00:16:02,267 --> 00:16:04,267
and her notorious monsters?

255
00:16:04,267 --> 00:16:04,767
No one knows for sure

256
00:16:04,767 --> 00:16:08,534
but thank you, Power Rangers,
whoever you are.

257
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:10,634
HEY, MORE RECYCLING, GANG.

258
00:16:10,634 --> 00:16:12,934
IT'S TIME TO GO TO WORK.

259
00:16:12,934 --> 00:16:14,374
OKAY, ERNIE.

260
00:16:23,801 --> 00:16:26,300
THAT MAKES OVER 500.

261
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,801
SOMEDAY SOON,
THIS PLASTIC WILL MAKE

262
00:16:28,801 --> 00:16:30,801
A LOT OF CREDIT CARDS.

263
00:16:30,801 --> 00:16:31,300
OH, YEAH?

264
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,801
WELL, CHECK OUT
THIS PILE OF PAPERS.

265
00:16:33,801 --> 00:16:36,801
MAN, WE JUST SAVED A REDWOOD.

266
00:16:36,801 --> 00:16:39,267
Skull:
REMEMBER, YOU WANT TO HELP.

267
00:16:39,267 --> 00:16:40,267
ACT REAL HELPFUL.

268
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:43,434
TELL THEM
YOU'RE HERE TO HELP.

269
00:16:43,434 --> 00:16:44,501
I KNOW MY LINE.

270
00:16:44,501 --> 00:16:45,667
ALL RIGHT.

271
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:46,734
SCENE 78.

272
00:16:46,734 --> 00:16:51,734
I ALWAYS HELP OUT
WITH THE RECYCLING DRIVE.

273
00:16:55,968 --> 00:16:57,408
WHAT A DORK.

274
00:17:08,033 --> 00:17:10,400
I'M GOING TO POUND YOU.

275
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,400
BULK, BULK, BULK, BULK.

276
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,834
I'M TAPING.

277
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:13,400
OH. OH, YEAH.

278
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,400
I THINK, WHENEVER POSSIBLE,
EVERYTHING SHOULD BE RECYCLED.

279
00:17:30,267 --> 00:17:34,968
TODAY, WE WILL BE SEEING
BULK AND SKULL'S VIDEO,

280
00:17:34,968 --> 00:17:36,367
WON'T WE?

281
00:17:36,367 --> 00:17:39,434
UM... WELL...

282
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:44,234
JUST FINISHED EDITING IT.

283
00:17:44,234 --> 00:17:46,734
THIS WILL BE
VERY INTERESTING.

284
00:17:46,734 --> 00:17:48,634
Bulk:
I'M SURE IT WILL BE

285
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,567
AN AWARD-WINNING PROJECT.

286
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:51,567
HOW'S IT LOOK?

287
00:17:51,567 --> 00:17:52,567
THERE ARE
A FEW GLITCHES

288
00:17:52,567 --> 00:17:56,434
BUT NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

289
00:17:56,434 --> 00:17:58,200
I have

290
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:58,901
no

291
00:17:58,901 --> 00:17:59,621
class.

292
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,534
Take your seats now.

293
00:18:03,534 --> 00:18:05,133
That Miss Appleby

294
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:06,467
can't, can't

295
00:18:06,467 --> 00:18:07,187
teach.

296
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,167
( stammering )

297
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:17,167
Pumping up is important to me.

298
00:18:41,634 --> 00:18:43,434
I'M GOING TO...

299
00:18:43,434 --> 00:18:43,934
I-I-I-I...

300
00:18:43,934 --> 00:18:46,400
THOUGHT I CUT
THAT PART OUT.

301
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,968
I pick

302
00:18:47,968 --> 00:18:49,528
trash myself.

303
00:18:59,434 --> 00:19:04,400
I think I should be recycled.

304
00:19:10,367 --> 00:19:12,767
I'M GOING TO POUND YOU,
CAMERAMAN!

305
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:15,834
I CAN FIX IT.
I CAN FIX IT.
