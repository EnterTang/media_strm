1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:03,640
Ahhh!

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,040
After 10,000 years, I'm free!

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,120
Its time to conquer earth!

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,360
Alpha, rita's escaped!

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,320
Recruit a team of
teenagers with attitude!

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,360
# Go, go, Power Rangers #

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,760
# Go, go, Power Rangers #

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,840
# Go, go, Power Rangers #

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,800
# Mighty Morphin Power Rangers #

10
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,920
# Power Rangers #

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,680
# Power Rangers #

12
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,560
# Go, go, Power Rangers #

13
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,560
# You Mighty Morphin
Power Rangers #

14
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,000
You okay, man?

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,400
Yeah.

16
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:15,800
Good move.

17
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,360
Hey, you weren't too bad yourself.

18
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,360
So, what's up with the dance?

19
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,840
I haven't asked her.

20
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,840
What?

21
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,840
I guess I'm nervous.

22
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,880
Aw, bro, I'm telling you.

23
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,880
Kimberly's going to say yes,

24
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,880
but you have to ask her first.

25
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,720
You think I should ask her today?

26
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,240
Don't put it off, man.

27
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,240
It's time to make your move.

28
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,080
You're right.

29
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,640
( Rita laughing )

30
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,960
The time has finally come!

31
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,480
Gather 'round, fools.

32
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,320
I have the perfect plan

33
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,360
to conquer that pathetic
little planet Earth.

34
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,960
Yes, it's so devious, even for me.

35
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,480
What's the plan, your Evilness?

36
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:05,080
With the green candle
formed from magic wax.

37
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,080
When it burns down

38
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,120
it will steal
the Green Ranger's powers.

39
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,760
First, we kidnap him

40
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,200
then the Earth shall shake.

41
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,720
You'll have the Green Ranger's power

42
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,720
as well as your own.

43
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,440
Ooh! Whisper softly.

44
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,440
Let it out.

45
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,400
Find Green Ranger.

46
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,560
Point him out!

47
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,200
Hey, it works!

48
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,320
It found him!

49
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:34,320
Oh, what a great day!

50
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,000
You lost

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,800
your focus.

52
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,080
'Cause you've got me
thinking about Kim.

53
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,320
The sooner you ask kim
to the dance

54
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,840
the sooner your mind
will be at ease.

55
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,840
Trust me.

56
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,320
Okay, if you're such a pro

57
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,840
let's see you in action.

58
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,840
Child's play, my friend.

59
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,320
First, you have to catch her eye

60
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,120
with your walk.

61
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,600
Then you have to impress her
with some smooth spins.

62
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,640
Finally, you just have
to bust a move.

63
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,160
Zack...

64
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,640
get a life.

65
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,640
( chuckling )

66
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,120
Real impressive, bud.

67
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,120
Yeah.

68
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,120
Real impressive.

69
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,720
If you're trying to get a date

70
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,360
with a carnival geek.

71
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,360
( giggling )

72
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,880
What's the matter?

73
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,880
Guys can't get a date?

74
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,800
If you're such experts,
you teach us.

75
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,800
Roses are red.

76
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,800
Violets are blue.

77
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,800
No girl in the world's
going to go out with you.

78
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,920
Hey, I'm stuck.

79
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,400
I'm stuck.

80
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,560
Get me out of here!

81
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,040
I can't breathe.

82
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,560
I can't breathe!

83
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,520
Hold still.

84
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,840
I'm trying.

85
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,760
Yo, ladies, check this out.

86
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,920
Roses are red.

87
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,440
Violets are blue.

88
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,960
BOTH:
We can learn something from you.

89
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,920
- Not!
- Not!

90
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,680
Candle green with fire's flower.

91
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,400
Ba she sha ba!

92
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,560
Take Green Ranger's power!

93
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,360
It will be done.

94
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,440
The Putties will find Green Ranger

95
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,960
and take his coin!

96
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,440
( laughing )

97
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,920
And then...

98
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,440
( laughing )

99
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,920
And then we'll have him!

100
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,800
So what did you want
to talk to me about?

101
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,800
You sounded so serious
over the phone.

102
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,320
Yeah, um.

103
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,840
Well, I wanted to know if...

104
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,840
Yes?

105
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,320
If maybe you'd like to, uh...

106
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,840
Like to what, Tommy?

107
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,800
Kim, I just don't know

108
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,320
how to ask you this.

109
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,320
Come on, Tommy.

110
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,400
You can ask me anything.

111
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,400
Really?

112
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:02,920
Yes.

113
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,880
All right.

114
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,880
Here it goes.

115
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,880
Um... Kim, I was wondering

116
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,880
if maybe you'd like to go to the...

117
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,720
Look out!

118
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,680
Putties!

119
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,160
Tommy, my Morpher!

120
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,080
I can't reach mine!

121
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,120
It's Goldar!

122
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,920
What do you want, metalhead?

123
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,720
Now take him!

124
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,280
( screaming )

125
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,080
( sinister laughing )

126
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,880
Tommy!

127
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:32,880
Say goodbye to Green Ranger
forever.

128
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,160
Just like old times,

129
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,320
isn't it, Green Ranger?

130
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:46,000
What's this all about, Goldar?

131
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,440
Ah, yes. His Morpher!

132
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,520
Leave him to me.

133
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,080
Get comfortable, Green Ranger.

134
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,200
Rita has big plans for you.

135
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:56,920
Never!

136
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,480
( laughing )

137
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,080
Jason. Alpha.

138
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,600
Forget it.

139
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,920
Your telecommunications devices
don't work in this dimension.

140
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,120
Why am I here?

141
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,600
It's simple.

142
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,320
If you serve Rita,
you can keep your powers.

143
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,320
If not, you'll lose them
when the candle burns out.

144
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,320
What candle?

145
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,920
The green candle.

146
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,880
( laughing )

147
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,880
It's made of very special wax.

148
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,400
When it burns out

149
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,400
Rita will have stolen your powers!

150
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,840
( laughing )

151
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,040
Do you have my monster ready?

152
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,600
'Cause, Finster, I need it.

153
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,240
Coming right up, your Evilness.

154
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,600
He's the worst

155
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,600
in the best of ways, of course.

156
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,600
He's able to change
into any shape at will.

157
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,000
Ooh, this I want to see!

158
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,800
He looks great.

159
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,520
( laughing )

160
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,240
Here's looking at you!

161
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,680
Boy, he makes me look good

162
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,680
doesn't he?

163
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,040
Uh-huh.

164
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,040
Yes, yes.

165
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,520
Meet the Cyclops.

166
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,640
The Earth is mine at last!

167
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,160
Yes!

168
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,640
I won't let you

169
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,240
get away with this, Goldar.

170
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,800
Like to stop

171
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,280
the candle from burning?

172
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,800
Be my guest.

173
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,240
( laughing )

174
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,320
You are doomed!

175
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,320
Another one of Rita's wicked plans.

176
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,840
She's going to try

177
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,800
and regain control of Tommy.

178
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,280
I just know it.

179
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,320
I can't get a lock on him.

180
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,400
Rita must be holding him
in her dimensional prison.

181
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,640
Billy, you come up with anything?

182
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,640
Not yet.

183
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,120
I'm still trying to tune
into the frequency

184
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,120
on Tommy's Morpher.

185
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,640
( alarm wailing )

186
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,000
Ay-yi-yi.

187
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,960
The alarm!

188
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,840
The Viewing Globe.

189
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,360
JASON:
Dragonzord.

190
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,440
TRINI:
Attacking Angel Grove.

191
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,320
That means one thing.

192
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:10,320
Rita has regained control
of the Dragonzord.

193
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,920
( alarm wailing )

194
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,240
We got to stop it.

195
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,280
What about Tommy?

196
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,760
We'll have to take him down too.

197
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,280
ZORDON:
Wait. My sensors indicate

198
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,960
the Dragonzord we see

199
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,680
is an impostor.

200
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,720
One of Rita's creations?

201
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,760
She's trying to lure us into a trap.

202
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,280
It's got to be stopped.

203
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,920
Be careful, Power Rangers.

204
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,840
It's Morphin Time!

205
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,800
Mastodon!

206
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,800
Pterodactyl!

207
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,400
Triceratops!

208
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,000
Saber-toothed Tiger!

209
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Tyrannosaurus!

210
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,680
Go!
Make them pay, Goldar!

211
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,680
I am called to battle.

212
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,720
Hey, don't get any foolish ideas,
Ranger.

213
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,720
The candle will be safe while I'm away.

214
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,320
See?

215
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,760
( laughing )

216
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,480
( grunting )

217
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,240
( kiais )

218
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,560
Waste them!

219
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,640
Where's Tommy, Goldar?!

220
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:06,680
You will never see your friend again!

221
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,760
It's destroying the city!

222
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,760
We've got to do something,
and fast!

223
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,360
Oh, man!

224
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,120
We need Dinozord power now!

225
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,720
Log on!

226
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,720
Mastodon-- ready to rock!

227
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,200
Triceratops-- online!

228
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,880
Saber-toothed Tiger-- set!

229
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,360
Pterodactyl-- powered up!

230
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,320
Power up your Crystal.

231
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,360
Two, one, power up.

232
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:35,360
Okay, Power Rangers,
let's do it!

233
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,960
Let's show them
some Megazord power!

234
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:57,960
Megazord sequence
has been initiated.

235
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,790
Megazord Activated.

236
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,000
( yelling )

237
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,360
( yelling )

238
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,640
It's just as powerful
as the real Dragonzord.

239
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,840
What if we can't defeat him?

240
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,840
We've got to.

241
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,360
But how?

242
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,120
We could do it with Tommy's help.

243
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,120
We've got to pull together
until he's here.

244
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,200
Hey!

245
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,560
I'm back, and happy to report

246
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,040
your miserable friends

247
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,640
are losing the battle.

248
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,000
You won't defeat them, Goldar.

249
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Once she has your power

250
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,560
Rita will be able
to defeat everyone.

251
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,720
She'll never have it.

252
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,920
Oh, she will!

253
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,400
See how it burns?

254
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:17,400
Like to try stopping it again?

255
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,840
Face it, Green Ranger,
you're trapped.

256
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,960
I saw how you got me here, Goldar.

257
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,480
Now let's see if it works in reverse.

258
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,960
Hey! No!

259
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,710
No!

260
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,440
See you later, gold guy!

261
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,960
Dragonzord!

262
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,360
Well, you may have escaped

263
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:55,360
but your powers won't last,
for your candle burns low.

264
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,720
Huh? Oh, no!

265
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,160
Rangers, I'm here.

266
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,640
Goldar had me trapped!

267
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,000
All right!

268
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,840
It's time for some real
Dragonzord power!

269
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,640
( horn playing )

270
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:21,760
Huh?

271
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:26,760
My powers are weakening already.

272
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,000
Hey,
here comes the real Dragonzord.

273
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,250
Look!

274
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,480
Huh? Yes!

275
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,560
We must have hurt him.

276
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:06,560
He can't hold his shape anymore.

277
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,440
Way to go!

278
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,480
Way to go, Tommy!

279
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,480
Glad you're back.

280
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,760
I'm a Power Ranger till the end.

281
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,760
RITA: Yes, and your end
will come soon, Green Ranger.

282
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,400
Very soon.

283
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,600
( laughs )

284
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,920
What is Alpha doing?

285
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,960
He's scanning Tommy

286
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,440
for internal damage
due to crossing dimensions.

287
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,920
You're all clear.

288
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,920
Thanks, Alpha.

289
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,920
You are welcome.

290
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,440
I'm just glad
I could get out of there.

291
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,200
Rita's secret dimension
is one bad place.

292
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,680
The important thing
is that you're okay.

293
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,960
Am I?
According to Rita

294
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,520
my power's going to be gone soon.

295
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,360
She's just bluffing, Tommy.

296
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,400
How would she be able
to take away your power?

297
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,000
ZORDON:
I'm afraid

298
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,800
it is possible, Rangers.

299
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,360
Zordon,
then you found out something

300
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,360
about the green candle
I told you about.

301
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:08,200
Yes. Rita has a special wax
from the gamma-tri system.

302
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,720
Once touched, it retains
a person's body energy.

303
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,120
I never touched anything.

304
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,280
You did when you worked for Rita.

305
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:15,720
KIM: No way!

306
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,240
And she's been saving the wax

307
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,240
all this time?

308
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,240
Yes.

309
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,120
And now she has made a candle

310
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,160
and cast a spell over it

311
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,160
connecting
the Green Ranger's power

312
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,920
with its flame.

313
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,480
Then Rita wasn't bluffing.

314
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,480
Once the candle burns out,
I'm history.

315
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,480
The Green Ranger's... finished.

316
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,480
( Rita laughing )

317
