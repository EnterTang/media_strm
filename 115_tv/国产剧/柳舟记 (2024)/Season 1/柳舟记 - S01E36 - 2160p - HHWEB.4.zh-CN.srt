1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,660
- SIREN WAILS
- 'Octonauts, to your stations!'

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,340
Barnacles!

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,780
Kwazii!

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,380
Peso!

5
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,020
- Explore!
- Rescue!
- Protect!

6
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,340
Octonauts!

7
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,060
Hm, you sound a lot better.

8
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,180
And your temperature is back to normal, too.

9
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,780
In a few days, you'll be feeling fine again.

10
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,620
Wait and see... Cucumber.

11
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:06,020
Get it? See, Cucumber?

12
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,300
Because you're a sea cucumber!

13
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,860
HE CHUCKLES

14
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,420
OK, let's get you back to your home.

15
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,700
Tweak! Are you there?

16
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,500
Sure, Cap. What's up?

17
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,300
We have an emergency, up here in the HQ.

18
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,620
The hot chocolate machine has gone haywire

19
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,260
and we can't turn it off!

20
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,380
THEY SQUEAL

21
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:36,140
Oh, GUP-E's battery is almost out of power.

22
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,220
I was just going to replace it.

23
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,380
But it can wait. Be there in a minute!

24
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,540
Ah, looks like the GUP-E is ready to go.

25
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,860
There we are, nice and comfy.

26
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,740
Hm, I wonder where Tweak is.

27
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,180
BEEPING

28
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,820
Whoa, it certainly is dark down here.

29
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,220
Oh, that's better!

30
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:35,460
OK, little sea cucumber. This is where I found you.

31
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,180
Off you go!

32
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,100
Thank you!

33
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,540
Flappety flippers!

34
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,580
Whoa!

35
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,900
Oh!

36
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,740
CRASHING

37
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:08,260
I think I'm trapped down here in this trench.

38
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,100
But you'll figure a way out of this, Peso.

39
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,420
Oh! Everything is going to be fine.

40
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,900
POWER SPLUTTERS AND CUTS OUT

41
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,260
OK, it's just a little dark down here.

42
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,700
That's all, nothing to be afraid of.

43
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,020
I'll just radio the Octopod for help.

44
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,580
Hello?

45
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,780
Peso to Octopod. Can anyone hear me?

46
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,340
Come in, Octopod!

47
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,220
Hello?

48
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,180
No radio!

49
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,700
The battery is out of power.

50
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,660
Ah! Here we go, Cap.

51
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,300
All fixed up!

52
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,620
Ah!

53
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,380
Next time, remember to put the marshmallows into the chocolate

54
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,820
AFTER it comes out of the machine.

55
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,100
Um, thank you, Tweak.

56
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,620
OK, let's clean up this mess and get ready to launch the Octopod.

57
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,020
- Righty-o, Captain.
- Aye-aye, sir.

58
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,460
RUMBLING

59
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,620
Steady as she goes.

60
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,820
- Dashi, call the roll.
- Kwazii?

61
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,340
- Aye.
- Tweak?

62
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,980
- Aye!
- Shellington?

63
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,100
- Present.
- Professor Inkling?

64
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,340
Why, yes!

65
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,940
Tunip and the vegimals?

66
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,420
THEY RESPOND

67
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,540
We'll take that as a yes.

68
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,020
Captain Barnacles?

69
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,860
Um, Dashi, I'm standing right next to you.

70
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,620
Just doing my job, sir. Peso?

71
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,260
Peso?

72
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,940
'Peso, come in!'

73
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,420
Peso?

74
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,940
Stop the ship!

75
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,420
Ah! Where in the seven seas is Peso?

76
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,100
This Octo glow stick will help me see a little better.

77
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,860
At least while I work out what to do.

78
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,300
- Ah!
- Boo!

79
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,020
PESO SHRIEKS

80
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,740
Peso?

81
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,700
Peso? Where are you?

82
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,700
Yoo-hoo, Peso!

83
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,900
Peso? Are you in here?

84
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,420
Huh?!

85
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,020
Where did the GUP-E go?

86
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,020
Better check the GUP finder.

87
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,500
Oh, no!

88
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,060
Cap, Peso must be in the GUP-E.

89
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,540
And it's trapped way down deep in an ocean trench!

90
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,740
Peso, come in. Hello?

91
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,620
Hello, Peso?

92
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,540
- His radio isn't working!
- GUP-E's battery must have run out.

93
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,020
Dashi, sound the Octo alert!

94
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,340
- ALERT SOUNDS
- Octonauts, to the launch bay!

95
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,740
Octonauts, there is no time to waste.

96
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,540
We've got to rescue Peso.

97
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,020
Kwazii, Tweak - into the GUP-C.

98
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,740
Who are you?

99
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,940
Boo!

100
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,220
Ah!

101
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,740
You...scared me!

102
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,540
I'm sorry. You asked who I am.

103
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,100
Yes, I did.

104
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,100
So, who are you?

105
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,780
- Boo!
- Ah!

106
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,540
Will you please stop doing that?

107
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,140
Stop what?

108
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:23,100
- Scaring me!
- I didn't mean to scare you.

109
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,540
- I'm sorry.
- Well, OK.

110
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,340
So what's you're name?

111
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,380
- Boo! Boo! Boo!
- PESO SHRIEKS WITH FRIGHT

112
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,380
My name is Boo!

113
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,220
I'm a spook fish.

114
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,700
A what?

115
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:40,140
A spook fish! Everyone thinks we're all spooky and stuff cos we have

116
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,340
these clear see-through heads. And we can do this...

117
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,660
with our eyes.

118
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,980
Ha, see?

119
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:49,380
Wow! That IS spooky, Boo.

120
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,060
Ha, told ya!

121
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,300
According to the GUP finder, the GUP-E is stuck around here,

122
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,660
inside that trench.

123
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,700
Cap, our GUP won't fit in there.

124
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,420
- She's right.
- Tweak, you wait here.

125
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,180
We may need that tow line.

126
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,500
Kwazii and I are going in.

127
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,460
Hey, want to play a game?

128
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,220
Now?

129
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,060
Oh, why not!

130
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:23,260
It's called I Spy With My Little Eye.

131
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:27,020
One of us looks around and says the first letter of what we see

132
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,500
and the other one has to guess what it is!

133
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,620
It is kind of dark down here.

134
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,940
But, OK.

135
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:39,060
I spy with my little eye something beginning with...

136
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,300
P.

137
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,860
Is it...

138
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,100
a penguin?

139
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,620
No.

140
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,580
- Plankton?
- No.

141
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,740
Er... Oh, I give up. What is it?

142
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,500
A polar bear!

143
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,420
Oh, OK. My turn.

144
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,020
I spy with my little... A polar bear?!

145
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,820
That polar bear is Captain Barnacles and Kwazii!

146
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,180
They've come to rescue me!

147
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,620
Peso, are you OK?

148
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,900
Aye, Captain. I got stuck down here when the GUP-E's battery died.

149
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,260
But I'm fine.

150
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,500
And who's that wee little GUP-E with you?

151
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,020
Oh. This is my new friend.

152
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,340
- Boo!
- Ah!

153
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:21,180
Shiver me whiskers! What manner of wild ocean beastie is this?

154
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,980
I'm not a beastie.

155
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,300
My name is Boo! I'm a spook fish.

156
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,900
We can see right up through our heads.

157
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,140
Aye-aye.

158
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,420
Tweak, we're going to need that tow line.

159
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,940
You've got it, Cap.

160
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,820
Let's hook it to the GUP and pull her out of here.

161
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,940
OK. Lift her up.

162
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,180
Steady, Tweak.

163
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,900
Careful!

164
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,700
PESO GASPS

165
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,180
Captain, look out!

166
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,220
What happened down there? You guys all right?

167
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,660
We're OK, Tweak.

168
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,740
But rocks fell over the GUP and now we can't move it.

169
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,300
Captain, what are we going to do?

170
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,540
Kwazii and I will just have to try to push that huge rock

171
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,780
out of the way.

172
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,220
Peso, Tweak will pull you up.

173
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,300
You steer away from the rocks.

174
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,660
But how will I see where I'm going?

175
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:29,260
If the ship's upside down I won't be able to see up.

176
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,020
Ah! We know someone who CAN see up.

177
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,780
We do?

178
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,820
Of course we do! Boo!

179
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,780
Sure, I'll help Peso steer.

180
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,780
Octonauts, let's do this!

181
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:48,220
On the count of three, Kwazii. One, two, three...

182
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,380
- Push!
- THEY GROAN

183
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,700
Now, pull, Tweak!

184
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,740
Now steer to the left, just a little.

185
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,020
OK. Steady.

186
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,220
Turn to the right.

187
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,500
That's it! Now steer left, just a bit!

188
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,500
That's good, Peso!

189
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,500
Now keep going straight.

190
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,380
- Ah!
- Ah!

191
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,100
- Way to go!
- We did it! Yay!

192
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,620
Well done, crew.

193
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,420
And you, too, Boo.

194
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,020
Boo?!

195
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,340
Me! Boo!

196
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,660
Oh! Ha-ha!

197
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,180
THEY ALL LAUGH

198
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,700
