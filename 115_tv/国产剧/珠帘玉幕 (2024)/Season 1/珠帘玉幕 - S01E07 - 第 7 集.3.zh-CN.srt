伦敦爆发了可怕的霍乱
London experienced a terrible cholera outbreak.

46
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:33,490
当地医生将传染病归咎于
Local doctors attributed the epidemic

47
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:36,739
瘴气  或者说是糟糕的空气
to miasma, or bad air.

48
00:03:37,063 --> 00:03:39,570
他们的对策是焚香驱病
Then they responded to it by burning incense

49
00:03:39,964 --> 00:03:43,223
结果促进了当时香花的销量
and promoting the sale of fragrant flowers.

00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,447
大家可以试想
Not, as you might imagine,

51
00:03:45,448 --> 00:03:49,401
这对在疾病中死去的六百多人可没什么帮助
terribly helpful to the 600 or so who died of the disease.

52
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:53,246
但一位医生和一位牧师
But a doctor and a clergyman

将病人的分布在地图上标了出来
mapped out the victims,

54
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:59,472
这就是史上首次进行的流行疾病学研究
and this was the very first epidemiological study.

55
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:00,827
他们发现
What they found...

56
00:04:01,097 --> 00:04:04,522
在布罗德街附近病例密集
was a cluster of cases around Broad Street,

57
00:04:04,523 --> 00:04:06,069
而那里有个城市水泵
where there was a city water pump.

58
00:04:08,156 --> 00:04:11,296
他们违抗当局  做出了一件出乎意料的事
Defying the local authorities, they did the unthinkable.

59
00:04:11,962 --> 00:04:13,838
他们将泵柄拆了下来
They took off the handle,

60
00:04:17,313 --> 00:04:19,653
疫情因此受到了控制
and the outbreak came to an end.

61
00:04:19,654 --> 00:04:21,889
但是当初的教训仍流传至今
But the lesson lives on,

73

你们将做出他人难以想象的牺牲
You will make sacrifices that others find unthinkable.

你们会走上这条路
And you will do all of this...

77
00:05:12,758 --> 00:05:15,521
是因为你们坚定这是自己的理想
because you cannot fathom living any other life.

才听过不少他们的事迹
Just read about them.

89
00:06:06,498 --> 00:06:09,289
求救内容提及一场可能的逆转录病毒爆发
The call denoted a possible retroviral outbreak.

and a third person already infected.

抱歉  你是谁来着  
I'm sorry, who are you again?

00:06:17,895 --> 00:06:20,239
我受命护送你和你的快速反应团队
I've been instructed to escort you and your rapid response team,

96

包括沃克博士前往基地
including Dr. Walker, up to the base

97
00:06:21,992 --> 00:06:24,709
去确认是否真的有逆转录病毒的爆发
to determine whether it is in fact a retrovirus.

98
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,662
鉴于是军队接到的求救呼叫
Now, given that the army fielded the distress call,

99
00:06:27,663 --> 00:06:29,602
我们将与疾病防治中心有同样的管辖权
we're gonna share jurisdiction with the CDC.

100
00:06:29,603 --> 00:06:31,526
看上去那里根本没什么管辖权可言  
It looks like there's no jurisdiction at all. 

101
00:06:31,526 --> 00:06:33,322
如果基地在八十三度的纬度上
If the base is above the 83rd parallel, 

102
00:06:33,322 --> 00:06:36,017
那就是国际区域  我们在那没有主权
it's international territory. We have no authority there.

这些都没关系  但为什么选我
This is all fine, but why me?

106

There are six other senior scientists at the CDC

who can run point on this, including Dr. Walker.

108
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,912
呼叫求救特别要求了沃克博士前往
The distress call specifically asked for Dr. Walker.

109
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,721

就是确认病原体  
is to identify this pathogen. 

117
00:07:51,886 --> 00:07:55,209
莎拉  你和我与彼得负责检查死者
Sarah. You'll be with me and Peter on the deceased

茱莉亚负责找出疾病的主因
Julia will determine the cause of the illness.

Doreen, I need you to swab every inch of Peter's lab,

121
00:08:02,532 --> 00:08:04,380
检测每一只动物  查出病毒的来源
test every animal for the source of the illness.

122
00:08:04,867 --> 00:08:08,163
那你呢  大兵哥  你到底是干什么的
How about you, GI Joe? What is it that you do exactly?

123
00:08:08,857 --> 00:08:10,971
我是个系统工程师  我将分析基地的
I'm a systems engineer. I'll be analyzing the base

124

基础设施  空气  水
infrastructure, air, water,

125

废物处理  找到病毒可能传播的

管道或通风口
have spread through pipes or air vents.

127
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:18,136
所以你不过是个说得好听点的管道工
So, you're a glorified plumber.

128
00:08:18,136 --> 00:08:20,286
你不也就是个名头响亮点的兽医吗  
Only if you're a glorified veterinarian. 

129
00:08:20,286 --> 00:08:22,767
听着  我们完全不知道这是什么病毒
Look, we have no idea what this thing is,

130
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,373
所以我们要把它当作高传染性病毒对待 
so we treat it like a hot agent. 

131
00:08:24,373 --> 00:08:26,620
生物四级安全协议  全套防护服
BSL-4 protocol, full suits,

132
00:08:26,621 --> 00:08:29,459
接触每一个潜在感染源后都要进行消毒淋浴
and decontamination showers for every potential exposure.

133
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,672
那会消耗很多时间
That could eat up a lot of time.

134

小心驶得万年船
Well, better safe than sorry.

-那就是他前妻吗  -没错
- That's his ex-wife? - Yep.

138
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:41,954
-跟我想象中不一样  -她比你聪明
- Not what I expected. - She's smarter than you.

139
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:45,917
-我很怀疑  -在实验室里也比你强
- Doubtful. - Better in the lab too.

140
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,395
深表怀疑
Highly doubtful.

141
00:08:52,528 --> 00:08:54,562
他从不提及她或者他弟弟
He never talks about her or his brother.

142
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,654
他不说的原因很可能是因为
That's probably because

143
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:59,016
他曾将他前妻和弟弟捉奸在床
he caught her and his brother in bed together.

144
00:09:00,434 --> 00:09:02,559
不过别担心  他们都是专业人士
Don't worry, they're professionals.

145
00:09:03,436 --> 00:09:04,865
他们不会让私人感情影响工作的
They'll make it work.

146
00:09:06,134 --> 00:09:07,541
我为什么要担心
Why would I be worried?

147
00:09:08,497 --> 00:09:10,542
因为我注意到你看他的眼神
Cause I see the way you look at him.

148
00:09:17,464 --> 00:09:21,100
这真是史上最诡异的家庭重聚了
This is gonna be the most frakked-up family reunion ever.

149
00:09:21,697 --> 00:09:23,868
猛禽47即将抵达北极生物公司  请回复
Raptor 47 to Artic Biosystems, come in.

150
00:09:24,057 --> 00:09:25,689
我们看到你了  猛禽47  一清二楚
We read you, Raptor 47, loud and clear.

151
00:09:25,772 --> 00:09:28,034
我们即将到达  可以降落了吗
We're making our final approach. We clear for landing?

152
00:09:50,364 --> 00:09:52,082
丹尼尔・埃罗夫  安全负责人
Daniel Aerov, Head of Security.

153
00:09:52,153 --> 00:09:54,140
抱歉我们没有铺红地毯迎接你们  
Sorry we don't have the red carpet waiting, 

154
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,506
这里很少会有访客到来  
but we're not used to visitors.

155
00:09:55,506 --> 00:09:56,625
我们对红地毯什么的也不感冒
We're not used to red carpets.

156
00:09:56,626 --> 00:09:58,409
这位是x宏博士
This is Dr. Hiroshi Hatake,

157
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,326
这里的研究主管 
Director of Research.

158
00:09:59,326 --> 00:10:01,525
艾伦・ 法拉格特  疾病防治中心的
Alan Farragut, CDC

159
00:10:01,525 --> 00:10:02,991
彼得的哥哥  一眼就能看出来
Peter's brother. Of course.

160
00:10:07,331 --> 00:10:08,497
我们为彼得远道而来  
We've come a long way for Peter. 

161
00:10:08,497 --> 00:10:09,330
什么时候能见到他
When can we see him?

162
00:10:09,331 --> 00:10:12,547
他被转移到我们的隔离区域去了 
He's been transferred to our isolation facility.

163
00:10:12,547 --> 00:10:14,263
恐怕这不是好消息
I'm afraid the news isn't good.

164
00:10:14,486 --> 00:10:15,846
他过去八小时都处在
He's been in and out of consciousness 

165
00:10:15,846 --> 00:10:17,717
时而昏迷时而清醒的状态
for the last eight hours.

166
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:18,849
你们这儿的其他人呢
And the rest of your people?

167
00:10:18,893 --> 00:10:21,374
你们采取硬隔离还是软隔离
Are you implementing hard or soft quarantine?

168
00:10:21,374 --> 00:10:21,921
都没有 
Neither.

169
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:23,794
你们还没有关闭基地吗  
You haven't locked down the base? 

170
00:10:23,794 --> 00:10:24,515
允许我解释一下
Allow me to explain.

171
00:10:24,516 --> 00:10:26,471
你们已经有三名受害者感染了未知的病原体
You have three victims of an unknown pathogen.

172
00:10:26,472 --> 00:10:27,899
仅此三人而已
And only three,

173
00:10:28,487 --> 00:10:30,112
而且他们都在同一个实验室工作
who all worked in the same lab.

174
00:10:31,153 --> 00:10:33,346
除此之外没有其他人感染
There have been no other infections.

175
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,393
鉴于感染没有
Since we are not seeing

176
00:10:34,394 --> 00:10:37,272
在整个基地爆发  所以我们相当确定
a base-wide outbreak, we are fairly certain

177
00:10:37,391 --> 00:10:38,840
感染不是通过空气传播的
it's not airborne.

178
00:10:38,841 --> 00:10:40,948
"相当确定"  那还真是让人放心
Well, at least you're fairly certain.

179
00:10:41,785 --> 00:10:44,003
我们的直升机怎么走了
Hey, that's our ride.

180
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:45,230
他们不能留在这里
They can't stay here.

181
00:10:45,231 --> 00:10:46,817
这里气温可低至华氏零下70度
The temperature can drop to -70;

182
00:10:46,818 --> 00:10:47,837
会把飞机燃料都冻成胶状
it turns jet fuel to jelly.

183
00:10:47,838 --> 00:10:49,857
再说了  完全控制形势前我们不能贸然离开
Plus, we can't risk leaving before we have full containment;

184
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:52,395
-这是疾控中心规定  -这下我感觉好多了
- CDC protocol. - You just made me feel better,

185
00:10:52,396 --> 00:10:54,464
-至少知道他们没走  -不用担心
- knowing they're out there. - Not to worry.

186
00:10:54,465 --> 00:10:56,621
艾森豪威尔营地离这只有两百多英里
Camp Eisenhower is only 200 miles away.

187
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:58,093
他们飞回来很快的
They can be back here in no time.

188
00:10:58,094 --> 00:11:00,113
大家伸出左手  我们得把射频识别标识
Please stick out your left hand. RFID marker

189
00:11:00,114 --> 00:11:02,281
注射到皮层之下  这里的人都有
injected under the skin. We all have them.

190
00:11:02,369 --> 00:11:04,671
你们的权限能在基地内每一处随意进出
Yours will give you unrestricted access to the base.

191
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:12,786
授予主电梯安全访问权
Main elevator security access granted.

192
00:11:21,508 --> 00:11:22,675
B层
Level B.

193
00:11:29,352 --> 00:11:31,691
我的老天
Sweet Mother Mary Matthew.

194
00:11:31,887 --> 00:11:33,367
这里一共有多少人
How many people work here?

195
00:11:33,513 --> 00:11:36,973
我们有来自35个不同国家的106位科学家
A hundred six scientists from 35 countries;

196
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,246
还有15名后勤人员
15 support staff.

197
00:11:39,334 --> 00:11:41,005
潜在患者不少啊
That's a lot of potential patients.

198
00:11:41,006 --> 00:11:42,758
我们先关注眼前的吧
Let's focus on what we know.

199
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:45,366
我要看看感染者的人事档案
I'll need to see the personnel records of the infected,

200
00:11:45,523 --> 00:11:47,764
他们的工作经历和病史  还有
their professional and medical histories. I'll need to see

201
00:11:47,765 --> 00:11:50,102
他们的住处以及任何其它他们常去的地方
their living quarters and any other areas they frequented.

202
00:11:50,103 --> 00:11:53,068
我还要看看他们试验用的动物和研究资料
And I want access to their lab animals and research materials.

203
00:11:53,069 --> 00:11:54,254
此外  找到所有与他们
And I'll need to start tracking down

204
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:58,320
有接触的人  过去...48小时内的吧
anyone they've been in contact with for the past... 48 hours.

205
00:12:00,198 --> 00:12:01,662
知道了
Understood.

206
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,342
E层
Level E.

207
00:12:04,569 --> 00:12:06,294
现在我得先去看看我弟弟
Now I want to see my brother.

208
00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:13,344
F层
Level F.

209
00:12:19,652 --> 00:12:22,503
我已经很久没与彼得联系过了
I haven't talked to Peter in a long time.

210
00:12:26,844 --> 00:12:27,905
有多久
How long?

211
00:12:34,016 --> 00:12:35,213
自从那晚之后吗
That night?

212
00:12:36,934 --> 00:12:39,717
那晚我回家收拾了点东西就马上飞到拉巴斯了
I went home and packed a bag; caught the next flight to La Paz.

213
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:43,615
你做事总是那么冲动
Ah, you always did have issues with impulse control.

214
00:12:47,239 --> 00:12:48,484
我很担心
I'm worried.

215
00:12:48,604 --> 00:12:49,800
别担心
That's all right.

216
00:12:50,077 --> 00:12:52,089
现在我们来了  我们一定尽力救治他的
We're here, we'll do what we can for him.

217
00:12:55,205 --> 00:12:56,789
我担心的不是他
He's not the one I'm worried about.

10218
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:20,495
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}危险

10219
00:13:20,497 --> 00:13:22,607
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}心电图

220
00:13:20,929 --> 00:13:22,880
他的生命体征很糟糕
His vitals are all over the place.

221
00:13:25,798 --> 00:13:28,558
他  可能活不过今晚了
He... probably won't make it through the night.

222
00:13:43,705 --> 00:13:44,656
彼得
Peter.

223
00:13:46,044 --> 00:13:48,367
我要问你几个问题
I'm going to ask you some questions.

224
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,148
如果你说不了话
If you can't speak,

225
00:13:51,442 --> 00:13:53,631
就点头或者摇头回答
try to nod yes or no.

226
00:13:55,798 --> 00:13:58,381
-你们这里有T1光纤网络吗  -没有
- Do you have a T1 link here? - No.

227
00:13:59,035 --> 00:14:00,414
那就惨了  要把这些数据
That's too bad. It's gonna take forever

228
00:14:00,415 --> 00:14:02,355
上传回亚特兰大那得要多久啊
to upload this data back to Atlanta.

229
00:14:02,964 --> 00:14:05,235
我们没有T1是因为那个过时了
We don't have a T1 because it's obsolete.

230
00:14:06,316 --> 00:14:09,332
我们用的是同步光纤网络  速度每秒10G
It's a synchronous optical network - 10 gigs a second.

231
00:14:09,874 --> 00:14:10,738
这里的网速要求极高
It has to be fast,

232
00:14:10,739 --> 00:14:13,354
因为我们每天只有一个小时有卫星信号
'cause we only get the satellite an hour each day.

233
00:14:20,017 --> 00:14:22,363
对一个保安队长而言  你知道的医学
You seem to know a lot about medicine and technology

234
00:14:22,364 --> 00:14:24,591
和科技知识真不少啊
for a head of security.

235
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,128
这都是x博士教我的
Dr. Hatake taught me everything I know.

236
00:14:29,532 --> 00:14:30,841
你们在哪认识的
Where did you two meet?

237
00:14:34,065 --> 00:14:36,705
巴罗的一家孤儿院里
An orphanage. In Barrow.

238
00:14:38,313 --> 00:14:39,818
他收养了我
He adopted me.

239
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,145
从我记事起我就一直追随着他
I've been with him as long as I can remember.

240
00:14:44,532 --> 00:14:46,890
彼得  是我  艾伦
Peter, it's me, Alan.

241
00:14:51,231 --> 00:14:54,213
法拉格特博士  你知道这是什么地方吗
Dr. Farragut, do you know where you are?

242
00:14:55,289 --> 00:14:56,412
你知道
Do you know

243
00:14:56,413 --> 00:14:57,910
你发生了什么事吗
what happened to you?

244
00:15:02,698 --> 00:15:03,729
知道
Yes.

245
00:15:06,029 --> 00:15:07,232
白色房间
The white room.

246
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:14,289
彼得  彼得  看着我的眼睛
Peter. Peter. Look into my eyes.

247
00:15:14,435 --> 00:15:15,987
看着我的眼睛  能做到吗
Look into my eyes. Can you do that?

248
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,158
看着我的...  这就对了
Look into my... That's it.

249
00:15:19,743 --> 00:15:21,574
彼得  是我
Peter, it's me.

250
00:15:22,202 --> 00:15:23,410
我是艾伦
It's Alan.

251
00:15:31,981 --> 00:15:33,410
艾伦  看他的血
Alan, the blood.

252
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:34,817
是黑色的
It's black.

253
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,924
安保小队立刻来隔离室
I need a security team to quarantine now!

254
00:15:45,283 --> 00:15:46,221
你撒谎
You lie!

255
00:15:46,277 --> 00:15:47,628
你们都撒谎
You all lie!

256
00:15:48,945 --> 00:15:50,591
所有人都撒谎
Everyone lies!

257
00:15:53,263 --> 00:15:54,447
所有人
Everyone!

258
00:15:57,744 --> 00:15:59,324
所有人都撒谎
Everyone lies!

259
00:17:02,468 --> 00:17:05,194
彼得被分配到这间实验室工作多久了
How long had Peter been assigned to this lab?

260
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,680
六个月了
The last six months.

261
00:17:09,351 --> 00:17:10,480
他研究的是...
Working on...?

262
00:17:10,481 --> 00:17:12,118
恐怕我没有权利告诉你
I'm afraid that's over my pay grade.

263
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:15,342
你得去问x博士
You'd have to ask Dr. Hatake.

264
00:17:15,343 --> 00:17:17,129
你们寻求我们的帮助  却又不愿说出
You expect us to help you, but you won't tell us

265
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,341
你们到底在研究什么
what you're working on?

266
00:17:20,346 --> 00:17:21,851
我们每周都会检查那个
We check that weekly.

267
00:17:22,912 --> 00:17:24,142
干得不错
Good for you.

268
00:17:32,707 --> 00:17:36,211
瞧瞧  你还真是个大块头姑娘
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. Aren't you a big girl.

269
00:17:37,028 --> 00:17:38,318
还是小伙子
Or boy.

270
00:17:41,387 --> 00:17:43,271
它们没有性器官
They have no sex organs.

271
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:44,270
我们研究出一种
We've designed a way to inhibit

272
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:47,412
抑制生殖器官发育信号传输的方式
the signaling pathway responsible for genitalia.

273
00:17:47,413 --> 00:17:49,227
这样它们就不会胡乱繁殖
Makes control easier.

274
00:17:49,332 --> 00:17:51,425
我倒不介意在前夫身上试试这项技术
Got an ex-husband I wouldn't mind trying that on.

275
00:17:54,685 --> 00:17:57,215
-你们的猴子在哪  -我们没有猴子
- Where are the monkeys? - We don't have any monkeys.

276
00:17:57,593 --> 00:17:58,773
开玩笑吗
You're kidding, right?

277
00:17:58,847 --> 00:18:01,145
这种规模的研究会不拿猴子做试验吗
With the kind of work you're doing here?

278
00:18:01,904 --> 00:18:04,042
我说没有就是没有
No monkeys means no monkeys.

279
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:18,390
这是与彼得同时发现的另外两名感染者
These are the other two victims that were found with Peter.

280
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,131
你准备好了吗
You ready?

281
00:18:25,055 --> 00:18:26,019
是的
Yeah.

282
00:18:26,796 --> 00:18:28,061
打开袋子
Open the bag.

283
00:18:33,259 --> 00:18:34,309
这是怎么回事
What the hell?

284
00:19:08,637 --> 00:19:09,356
这种情况不会再发生了
That won't happen again;

285
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:11,781
-我向你保证  -我能理解  莎拉
- You have my word. - No, Sarah, it's OK.

286
00:19:12,202 --> 00:19:13,833
我见过不少高传染性病毒
I've been around some nasty hot agents,

287
00:19:13,847 --> 00:19:15,144
但还从没见过这样的
but I've never seen anything like that.

288
00:19:15,145 --> 00:19:17,239
没人见过这样的东西
No one has seen anything like this.

289
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,928
你还认为这是逆转录病毒吗
You still thinking retrovirus?

290
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:20,691
看上去更像是出血热病毒
Looks more like some kind of hemorrhagic fever.

291
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:24,076
出血症状符合埃博拉和马尔堡病毒  但是
Blood loss is consistent with Ebola or Marburg, but...

292
00:19:24,878 --> 00:19:27,002
这种程度的人体组织溶解
this kind of tissue degradation...

293
00:19:27,003 --> 00:19:29,785
这东西不仅能杀人  还能将人彻底湮灭
This thing doesn't kill; it annihilates.

294
00:19:29,861 --> 00:19:31,727
那为什么彼得还活着
So how was Peter still alive?

295
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,660
一步一步来  朵琳在哪里
First things first: where's Doreen?

296
00:19:37,013 --> 00:19:39,129
跟拜耶塞罗少校在检查彼得的实验室
With Major Balleseros, swabbing down Peter's lab.

297
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,769
好  尽快开始分析  莎拉
Good. Get started on the assays, Sarah.

298
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,187
我必须找出是什么病毒才能对付它
I need to see this thing to beat it.

299
00:19:43,188 --> 00:19:46,027
-我这就去  -茱尔斯  去跟x博士谈谈
- Yeah, I'm on it. - Jules, talk to Hatake.

300
00:19:46,028 --> 00:19:47,719
找出这些感染者当时在研究什么
Find out what our victims were working on.

301
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,460
我们得弄明白这是由什么导致的
We need to find the causation of this.

302
00:19:55,067 --> 00:19:56,756
你该去陪着彼得
You should be in there with Peter.

303
00:19:57,061 --> 00:19:58,716
不管他还剩下多少时间
Whatever time he's got left...

304
00:19:58,717 --> 00:20:01,399
不  他不会想让我坐在那看着他死去的
No, he wouldn't want me sitting around watching him die.

305
00:20:01,989 --> 00:20:03,148
你准备怎么做
What are you gonna do?

306
00:20:20,467 --> 00:20:21,898
果然如我所料
Yep, just as I thought.

307
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,477
你在干什么
Hey, what are you doing?

308
00:20:30,151 --> 00:20:33,603
这些在PRC测试后仍存活的老鼠正说明了
These live rats in the PRC test confirm conclusively

309
00:20:33,604 --> 00:20:37,293
x宏是对的  这病毒不会由空气传播
that Hatake's right - it isn't airborne.

310
00:20:43,026 --> 00:20:44,133
那真是太好了
That's good news.

311
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:48,523
是啊  只是我仍然找不出病原
Yep, except I'm no closer to the source,

312
00:20:49,271 --> 00:20:51,755
而且对它的传播途径也没有任何头绪
and I still have no idea on the mode of transmission.

313
00:20:53,939 --> 00:20:56,098
-我讨厌老鼠  -我却相反
- I hate rats. - I don't.

314
00:20:57,053 --> 00:20:58,597
我父亲是个军士长
My dad was a Master Sergeant;

315
00:20:58,598 --> 00:21:00,720
经常带着我们四处搬迁
moved us around a lot.

316
00:21:01,364 --> 00:21:02,858
老鼠比较容易携带
Rats are easy to travel.

317
00:21:06,315 --> 00:21:07,947
你在军队里经常干这个吗
You do this a lot in the service?

318
00:21:07,948 --> 00:21:10,678
将下水管道和马桶大卸八块来寻找病毒
Take apart drains and toilets looking for viruses?

319
00:21:10,829 --> 00:21:12,624
我第一次征战是去伊拉克
I spent my first tour in Iraq,

320
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:16,013
-搜索大规模杀伤武器  -见了不少大场面吧
- searching for WMDs. - See any action?

321
00:21:16,295 --> 00:21:19,207
-我几乎不出基地  -听起来可真危险
- Rarely left the base. - Sounds dangerous.

322
00:21:19,702 --> 00:21:22,237
我想你身上一定有不少被纸割伤的英勇战迹
Bet you got some pretty nasty paper cuts.

323
00:21:23,939 --> 00:21:26,070
过去几年我一直在南美洲
The last few years I spent

324
00:21:26,071 --> 00:21:28,415
和那些毒贩子们打交道
harassing the cartels in South America.

325
00:21:28,873 --> 00:21:30,565
他们一定都被你吓坏了吧
Must have been shaking in their boots.

326
00:21:32,477 --> 00:21:34,147
你真正开过枪吗
Ever actually fire a gun?

327
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:37,639
出了训练营之后就没有了
Not since boot camp.

328
00:21:44,128 --> 00:21:45,398
让我看看那个
Hey, let me see that.

329
00:21:59,516 --> 00:22:00,504
这是什么
What is it?

330
00:22:00,567 --> 00:22:02,306
猕猴的毛发
M. Mulatta.

331
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,051
如果我没有猜错的话
Unless I miss my guess,

332
00:22:05,518 --> 00:22:07,750
这是从恒河猴的身上来的
this is from a rhesus macaque.

333
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:11,055
这么说他们确实有猴子  那又如何
So, they have monkeys. What's the big deal?

334
00:22:11,474 --> 00:22:12,984
他们隐瞒了这个事实
That they lied about it.

335
00:22:13,285 --> 00:22:15,999
猴子是动物性传染的主要媒介之一
Monkeys are one of the main agents of zoonotic transfer -

336
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,238
它们能在动物和人类之间传播病毒
that's passing a virus from animal to human or vice versa.

337
00:22:20,963 --> 00:22:23,388
这么说  他们有什么是不想让我们知道的
So, what didn't they want us to find out?

338
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,698
x博士
Dr. Hatake?

339
00:22:39,331 --> 00:22:40,523
x博士
Dr. Hatake?

340
00:22:56,547 --> 00:22:57,795
真让人难以置信
Unbelievable.

341
00:22:58,359 --> 00:23:00,970
北极有一种隽永不变的特质
The Arctic has a timeless quality.

342
00:23:02,606 --> 00:23:03,829
你说是吗
Don't you agree?

343
00:23:04,887 --> 00:23:06,805
这里的交通可不太方便
Makes it a little tough on the commute, though.

344
00:23:08,315 --> 00:23:10,216
没有外界的干扰
We get more accomplished

345
00:23:10,217 --> 00:23:13,018
我们会取得更多成就
without the distraction of the outside world.

346
00:23:13,898 --> 00:23:16,573
比如说政府监管部门的介入吗
Like interference from regulatory agencies?

347
00:23:22,305 --> 00:23:24,648
我需要了解彼得过去几天的所有经历
I need to know everything about Peter's last few days,

348
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,180
他在忙什么  和谁一起忙
what he was working on, who he was working with--

349
00:23:26,181 --> 00:23:27,528
我就觉得你会问这个
I thought you might.

350
00:23:32,881 --> 00:23:35,611
-这都是什么  -彼得的研究
- What's all this? - Peter's research.

351
00:23:36,154 --> 00:23:38,041
还有二十多箱
There are 20 more boxes

352
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:39,247
在他的实验室里
in his lab.

353
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:41,935
我得花好几天才能整理清楚
That's gonna take me days to sort through.

354
00:23:41,936 --> 00:23:44,126
你能不能简单跟我说下他在忙什么
Can you at least tell me what he was working on?

355
00:23:44,127 --> 00:23:46,655
突变原  大部分都是
Mutagens, mostly.

356
00:23:47,283 --> 00:23:49,042
是用于加速基因突变的吗
For speeding up mutations.

357
00:23:49,706 --> 00:23:51,193
那些研究十分危险
Those are dangerous.

358
00:23:51,926 --> 00:23:56,317
绝对不是些你愿意让自己小孩轻易接触的东西
You wouldn't want to let your children play with them.

359
00:23:59,849 --> 00:23:57,486
你有孩子吗
Do you have children?

360
00:24:01,915 --> 00:24:03,620
不  还没有
No, I don't.

361
00:24:05,854 --> 00:24:08,198
你能想到他的研究与这高传染性病毒之间
Can you think of any correlation between his research

362
00:24:08,199 --> 00:24:10,004
-有任何联系吗  -不清楚
- and the infectious agent? - No.

363
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,006
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

10364
00:24:19,392 --> 00:24:22,512
{\an8}彼得・法拉格特博士

365
00:24:39,156 --> 00:24:42,904
第一轮班  请回应  第一轮班  请回应
Shift one, report. Shift one, report.

366
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:45,178
第一轮班  请回应
Shift one, report.

367
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,783
艾伦  组织样本已经...
Alan, tissues samples are--

368
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:57,896
我不是有意打扰的
Uh, I didn't mean to interrupt.

369
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,078
没关系
No, it's OK.

370
00:25:28,921 --> 00:25:30,684
224号视频日志
Entry 224.

371
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,640
今早晒了一会儿日光浴
Got in some UV therapy this morning.

372
00:25:34,144 --> 00:25:36,095
在跑步机上跑了三英里
Ran three miles on the treadmill.

373
00:25:36,811 --> 00:25:38,744
现在想分清昼夜越来越难了
It's getting harder to tell day from night,

374
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:41,033
但我想也无所谓了
but I guess that doesn't matter.

375
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:43,876
我还在和T约会
I'm still seeing T.

376
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:47,547
她...很棒
She is... terrific.

377
00:25:47,969 --> 00:25:49,142
但我不禁开始怀疑自己
But I'm starting to wonder

378
00:25:49,143 --> 00:25:51,772
是否真的准备好开始一段认真的恋情
whether I'm truly meant for relationships.

379
00:25:52,936 --> 00:25:54,383
倒不是说我不擅长谈恋爱
And it's not that I'm bad at them.

380
00:25:54,384 --> 00:25:57,279
感觉更像是  恋爱于我无益
It's more like... well, they're bad for me.

381
00:26:00,152 --> 00:26:03,116
总之  能来这里我很激动  我...
More than anything, I am excited about being up here. I...

382
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:05,738
我明白了一些事情
I understand certain things now.

383
00:26:10,014 --> 00:26:11,300
...我很激动  我...
...up here. I...

384
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,709
我明白了一些事情
I understand certain things now.

385
00:26:18,065 --> 00:26:21,549
-怎么了  -看他的手
- What is it? - Look at his hand.

386
00:26:21,879 --> 00:26:24,591
小时候无数个夜晚  每当父亲带着一身
We used to do that, nights when our father

387
00:26:24,592 --> 00:26:27,856
醉意或怒气回家时  我们就会做这个手势
came home drunk or angry, which was most nights.

388
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:31,354
这代表什么
What does it mean?

389
00:26:32,897 --> 00:26:34,214
赶紧逃命吧
Run like hell.

390
00:26:38,335 --> 00:26:40,028
你最好马上去一趟隔离室
You need to come to isolation now.

391
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,478
彼得出事了
It's Peter.

392
00:26:42,681 --> 00:26:43,967
污染
Contamination.

393
00:26:45,042 --> 00:26:46,426
污染
Contamination.

394
00:26:47,743 --> 00:26:49,191
污染
Contamination.

395
00:26:50,291 --> 00:26:51,610
污染
Contamination.

396
00:26:52,914 --> 00:26:54,273
污染
Contamination.

397
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,905
污染
Contamination.

398
00:26:58,119 --> 00:26:59,514
污染
Contamination.

399
00:27:00,581 --> 00:27:01,245
污染
Contamination.

400
00:27:01,865 --> 00:27:04,040
你怎么会在隔离室里面留了把骨锯
How do you leave him in there with a bone saw?

401
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:06,222
-我正忙着在...  -忙着遵守
- I was a little busy trying-- - Too busy to follow

402
00:27:06,223 --> 00:27:08,480
-四级安全协议吗  -你俩说的都不是重点
- BSL-4 safety protocol? - You're both missing the point here.

403
00:27:08,481 --> 00:27:09,357
重点是他怎么逃出去的
How did he get out?

404
00:27:09,358 --> 00:27:11,251
今天早上他还处在濒死状态
This morning he was terminally ill,

405
00:27:11,252 --> 00:27:12,268
现在却有力气破牢而出
now he's ripping out of restraints?

406
00:27:12,269 --> 00:27:13,517
我们封锁了整层楼
We sealed off the entire floor,

407
00:27:13,518 --> 00:27:16,255
解除了彼得的识别芯片权限  他无路可逃
deactivating Peter's RFID chip. He's trapped.

408
00:27:16,256 --> 00:27:17,885
但我们还得把他从里面逼出来
But we still need to get him out of there.

409
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,638
我们会在通风道里充满氟烷气[麻醉气体]
We're gonna flood the ducts with halothane gas.

410
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:21,205
-慢着  什么  -这样会使他昏迷四小时
- Wait, what? - It'll knock him out for four hours.

411
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:22,762
等气体散去后  再把他弄出来
Once the gas clears we'll retrieve his body.

412
00:27:22,763 --> 00:27:24,952
等下  彼得是我们
Look, Peter is our best chance

413
00:27:24,953 --> 00:27:27,272
弄清楚病毒感染模式的唯一机会
to understand how this pathogen works.

414
00:27:27,273 --> 00:27:28,382
他体内可能产生了抗体
He may have antibodies

415
00:27:28,383 --> 00:27:30,380
使他能够抵抗这种病毒感染
which have allowed him to fend off the infection.

416
00:27:30,381 --> 00:27:31,454
他绝不能死
We need him alive!

417
00:27:31,455 --> 00:27:34,143
我很抱歉  但我必须优先考虑
I'm sorry, but I have the lives

418
00:27:34,144 --> 00:27:35,872
其他120条人命
of 120 others to consider.

419
00:27:35,872 --> 00:27:39,065
在捉住他之前人人都有被感染的可能
No one is safe from the virus until we've contained him.

420
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:44,196
各安保小队  请确认楼层已封锁
Security teams, confirm level lockdown.

421
00:27:44,656 --> 00:27:45,978
-各安保小队...  -等麻醉气一清除
- Security teams, confirm... - Once the gas clears,

422
00:27:46,261 --> 00:27:49,473
我会带领安保人员把他带回隔离室
I'll take a security team and we'll bring him back to isolation.

423
00:28:08,905 --> 00:28:10,596
你要上去的话  带上我
If you're going up there, I'm going too.

424
00:28:10,965 --> 00:28:12,670
不行  这太危险了
I can't allow that. It's too dangerous.

425
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,487
只要彼得还有可能活着
If there's any chance Peter's alive,

426
00:28:14,488 --> 00:28:15,860
我就要上去找他
I need to be up there.

427
00:28:18,373 --> 00:28:19,608
如你所愿
As you wish.

428
00:28:37,285 --> 00:28:39,263
我们已经查了一个多小时了
Listen, we've been at this for over an hour,

429
00:28:39,264 --> 00:28:40,547
可还没发现一只猴子
and still no monkeys.

430
00:28:40,665 --> 00:28:43,214
既然x宏允许我们自由出入基地
If Hatake is granting us unrestricted access to the base,

431
00:28:43,215 --> 00:28:45,583
何不直接当面质问他关于猴子的事呢
why don't we just confront him, tell him we found a monkey hair?

432
00:28:45,584 --> 00:28:48,033
你太天真了  他怎么可能会告诉我们
Yeah, right. I doubt we'd get a straight answer.

433
00:28:48,037 --> 00:28:50,169
更何况  这样更有乐趣
Besides, this is way more fun.

434
00:28:51,485 --> 00:28:53,068
拒绝通过
Access denied.

10435
00:28:52,477 --> 00:28:54,564
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}转基因

436
00:28:54,004 --> 00:28:57,930
拒绝通过  拒绝通过
Access denied. Access denied.

437
00:28:58,444 --> 00:29:00,546
还自由出入呢  就这么点权限
So much for unrestricted access.

438
00:29:00,981 --> 00:29:02,650
你有好主意吗
You got any bright ideas?

439
00:29:16,067 --> 00:29:17,306
这有液氮
Liquid nitrogen.

440
00:29:18,082 --> 00:29:20,342
低温能改变抗张强度
Freezing rearranges the tensile strength.

441
00:29:47,214 --> 00:29:48,796
西北一区  安全
Northwest A, clear.

442
00:29:49,402 --> 00:29:51,288
西北二区  安全
Section northwest B, clear.

443
00:29:51,784 --> 00:29:53,668
西南二区  安全
Southwest B, we're clear.

444
00:29:55,457 --> 00:29:59,225
法拉格特博士  请汇报  法拉格特博士
Dr. Farragut, we need you to check in. Dr. Farragut.

445
00:29:59,226 --> 00:30:00,879
你确定我弟弟在这上面吗
Are you sure my brother's up here?

446
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,262
我们已经封锁了这个区域的通风管道
We sealed the vents in this sector,

447
00:30:02,263 --> 00:30:05,097
那种浓度的氟烷气体应该已经把他弄晕了
and that concentration of gas should have knocked him out.

448
00:30:18,863 --> 00:30:19,916
天呐
Jeez.

449
00:30:27,776 --> 00:30:29,240
这里到底发生过什么
What the hell happened here?

450
00:31:05,654 --> 00:31:06,883
这是什么味
What's that smell?

451
00:31:07,382 --> 00:31:12,003
猴子的味道  比这更臭的只剩人类了
That is monkey. The only creatures that smell worse are humans. 

452
00:31:12,276 --> 00:31:13,702
这里之前至少有上百只猴子
There must have been a hundred of them. 

453
00:31:13,975 --> 00:31:15,417
它们都到哪儿去了
Where the hell did they all go?

454
00:31:15,418 --> 00:31:18,885
不知道  但这个笼门被撬开了
I don't know, but someone busted off this cage door.

455
00:31:21,264 --> 00:31:22,732
还是从里面撬开的
From the inside.

456
00:31:32,836 --> 00:31:36,599
我这里发现了黑色液体
I've got something here. Uh... black mucus.

457
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,888
位于西南...
Uh, southwest... uh...

458
00:31:41,605 --> 00:31:44,880
西南三区
Yeah, southwest C.

459
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,139
他一定来过这
He was definitely here.

460
00:31:53,575 --> 00:31:54,700
那是什么
What was that?

461
00:32:05,343 --> 00:32:06,418
彼得
Peter?

462
00:32:07,655 --> 00:32:08,681
彼得
Peter!

463
00:32:24,891 --> 00:32:26,056
它很机灵
He's smart.

464
00:32:27,056 --> 00:32:28,616
是太机灵了
Way too smart.

465
00:33:07,948 --> 00:33:09,402
你在这啊
There you are,

466
00:33:10,117 --> 00:33:11,503
小家伙
handsome boy.

467
00:33:12,411 --> 00:33:13,615
出来吧
Come on out.

468
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:16,746
彼得
Peter!

469
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,576
来吧
Come on.

470
00:33:27,015 --> 00:33:29,954
-他在这  彼得在这  -请等待后援
- He's here! Peter's here! - Wait for backup!

471
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:39,319
你还好吗
Are you OK?

472
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,289
我有没有被划伤  皮肤上有伤口吗
Am I cut? Do you see any breaks on the skin?

473
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:46,326
-没有吧  -你要确定  人命关天
- I don't think so. - Be sure. It's important.

474
00:33:47,918 --> 00:33:49,044
你没事
You're OK.

475
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,305
他在这  彼得在这
He's here. Peter's here.

476
00:34:14,938 --> 00:34:17,462
不是他  这人...
It's not him. It's...

477
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,325
不是彼得
it's not Peter.

478
00:34:21,735 --> 00:34:22,910
我的天
Oh, my god.

479
00:34:40,373 --> 00:34:42,233
他是我的一名安保队员
He's on one of my security teams. 

480
00:34:42,234 --> 00:34:43,873
约瑟夫・肯尼泽  31岁
Joseph Kneizeh, 31 years old,

481
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:45,376
阿拉斯加的塔基纳人
Talkeetna, Alaska.

482
00:34:45,377 --> 00:34:48,417
-被袭击后遭截肢  -没道理啊
- He was attacked and dismembered. - This doesn't make sense.

483
00:34:48,546 --> 00:34:50,090
我们要问的应该是为什么
The question we should be asking is why? 

484
00:34:50,091 --> 00:34:52,977
彼得为什么袭击他  为什么砍了他的手
Why did Peter attack this man? Why cut off his hand?

485
00:34:53,237 --> 00:34:55,757
为什么病原体反而让他变强
And why is the pathogen making him stronger?

486
00:34:56,623 --> 00:34:59,073
我要封锁基地的这个区域
I want to seal off this part of the base.

487
00:34:59,177 --> 00:35:02,280
非必要人员都转移到指定安全室内
All nonessential personnel, keep them in dedicated safe rooms.

488
00:35:02,281 --> 00:35:04,433
任何人不得单独行动
Nobody travels unless they travel with a partner,

489
00:35:04,434 --> 00:35:06,933
直到我们抓回彼得
at least until we can recapture Peter.

490
00:35:08,537 --> 00:35:09,026
请注意
Attention,

491
00:35:09,027 --> 00:35:12,449
行动代码830  G层  肿瘤科  
code 830, level G, Oncology.

492
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:14,462
第一组培养菌里面有发现吗
Anything from the first set of cultures?

493
00:35:14,688 --> 00:35:17,180
细胞破坏情况严重  大部分完全变形
Cells are heavily damaged, most totally deformed.

494
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:20,200
就像经历过末日之战一般
It's like... armageddon down there.

495
00:35:20,638 --> 00:35:22,484
没发现病毒吗
But no sign of a virus?

496
00:35:23,126 --> 00:35:25,267
我把现今所有的病毒结构都筛选了一遍
I screened for all current viral structures --

497
00:35:25,268 --> 00:35:28,108
长丝体  多边体  圆柱体  球体
filaments, polygons, cylinders, spheres...

498
00:35:29,179 --> 00:35:30,922
连二十面体都没放过
even icosahedrons.

499
00:35:33,447 --> 00:35:34,991
如果不是现代病毒呢
What if it's not current?

500
00:35:37,007 --> 00:35:38,886
几位麻省理工的科学家
A couple of MIT scientists discovered evidence

501
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:40,825
在格陵兰冰芯内发现了古代病毒的存在证据
of ancient viruses in the Greenland ice cores.

502
00:35:40,826 --> 00:35:44,944
那些古老的病毒结构能追溯到十四万年前
They found these obsolete structures dating back 140,000 years.

503
00:35:49,788 --> 00:35:52,561
我得赞扬下艾伦  他确实慧眼识才
I gotta hand it to Alan, he's got an eye for the smart ones.

504
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:55,312
我们不是你想的那样
It's not like that.

505
00:35:55,313 --> 00:35:56,482
不是哪样
Not like what? 

506
00:35:56,483 --> 00:35:59,659
艾伦确实是位良师  但我们之间没有任何事发生
Alan is a great mentor, but there's nothing going on.

507
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,463
我以前也说过一样的话
I would have said the exact same thing.

508
00:36:03,767 --> 00:36:05,544
不过那都是八年前的事了
Only that was eight years ago.

509
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:12,627
看看这个
Look at that.

510
00:36:13,284 --> 00:36:15,192
什么  什么东西
What? What is it?

511
00:36:16,351 --> 00:36:17,293
在这
Right there.

512
00:36:18,928 --> 00:36:20,671
只有十五微毫
That's only 15nm.

513
00:36:21,148 --> 00:36:22,787
没有这么小的病毒
There's no virus that small.

514
00:36:23,123 --> 00:36:24,402
现今的病毒没有
No current virus.

515
00:36:25,791 --> 00:36:28,264
-你来完成这个  -你要去哪
- I need you to finish this. - Where are you going?

516
00:36:28,265 --> 00:36:30,718
去找艾伦  他必须马上看看这个
To find Alan. He needs to see this now.

517
00:38:32,924 --> 00:38:35,697
我们也不知从何下手  直到茱莉亚...
We weren't even sure what we eare looking for until Julia...

518
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:39,232
沃克博士开始检查它是否存在古神经细胞结构
Dr. Walker started checking for paleoneurological structures.

519
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,270
看起来像是某种形式的球状衣壳
It's some form of spherical capsid,

520
00:38:41,271 --> 00:38:44,816
但和任何已知的种类都不一样
but unlike anything we've ever seen before.

521
00:38:45,126 --> 00:38:47,933
这不是自然产生的  至少不是本世纪的产物
It's not naturally occurring - at least not in this century.

522
00:38:49,407 --> 00:38:51,764
这是放大十万倍的图像
Here it is blown up to 100,000 xPM.

523
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,739
这是五十万倍
Here's 500,000.

524
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,869
在雪中漫步的感觉如何
How was your walk in the snow?

525
00:38:56,974 --> 00:38:58,562
还不错  谢谢关心
Fine, thanks.

526
00:39:00,185 --> 00:39:02,720
你一定不太习惯这里的低温吧
A bit colder here than you're used to.

527
00:39:02,721 --> 00:39:04,935
无所谓  我能适应
Doesn't bother me. I'm adaptable.

528
00:39:05,338 --> 00:39:07,850
你也知道那些不能适应环境的人下场如何
You know what they say about those who fail to adapt.

529
00:39:09,633 --> 00:39:12,175
交货会按计划进行
The delivery will be on schedule.

530
00:39:12,202 --> 00:39:14,874
计划在疾控中心介入之后就不同了
The schedule changed when the CDC showed up.

531
00:39:15,445 --> 00:39:18,035
这与我无关
I had nothing to do with that.

532
00:39:18,782 --> 00:39:21,798
不管怎样  我们双方的雇主都不会满意
Either way, the people you and I work for aren't happy,

533
00:39:21,799 --> 00:39:23,775
现在我还得收拾你的烂摊子
and now I have to clean up your mess.

534
00:39:24,475 --> 00:39:27,007
那是什么鬼东西
Oh, what the hell is that?

535
00:39:28,362 --> 00:39:29,801
等等  还有这个
Wait, there's more.

536
00:39:37,635 --> 00:39:38,719
我的老天
My God. 

537
00:39:38,947 --> 00:39:41,341
我们本以为它只是在自我复制  但并不止如此
We thought it was just replicating, but there's something else.

538
00:39:41,342 --> 00:39:43,300
这种突变只发生在一小部分样品上
This mutation only occurs in a fraction of the samples.

539
00:39:43,301 --> 00:39:45,728
尽管很少  但在统计学来说仍然相关
It's minimal but it's statistically relevant.

540
00:39:45,729 --> 00:39:48,647
这或许能解释为什么只有彼得活下来了
Which could explain why Peter is still alive and the others died.

541
00:39:49,748 --> 00:39:51,381
但这会对他产生什么影响
But what's it doing to him?

542
00:39:52,247 --> 00:39:55,644
我只能说  这病毒正在改变他
For lack of a better term, it's... changing him.

543
00:39:57,862 --> 00:39:59,148
变成什么
Into what?

544
00:40:08,583 --> 00:40:11,617
*你知道去圣何塞的路吗*
*Do you know the way to San Jose?*

545
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:13,811
*我已离开太久*
*I've been away so long*

546
00:40:13,812 --> 00:40:16,087
*或许我会迷失方向*
*I may go wrong and lose my way*

547
00:40:16,088 --> 00:40:19,081
*你知道去圣何塞的路吗*
*Do you know the way to San Jose?*

548
00:40:19,082 --> 00:40:21,305
*我要回圣何塞*
*I'm going back to find*

549
00:40:21,306 --> 00:40:24,255
寻找内心的宁静*
*Some peace of mind in San Jose*

550
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:26,940
*洛杉矶就是条高速公路*
*LA is a great big freeway*

551
00:40:27,002 --> 00:40:30,297
*放下一百块美金买辆车*
*Put a hundred down and buy a car*

552
00:40:31,616 --> 00:40:35,332
*一周后  也许两周  你会成为明星*
*In a week, maybe two, they'll make you a star*

553
00:40:35,789 --> 00:40:39,314
*日复一日  时间飞逝*
*Weeks turn into years, how quick they pass*

554
00:40:39,315 --> 00:40:42,422
*没有成为明星的人*
*And all the stars that never were*

555
00:40:42,423 --> 00:40:45,784
*如今在泊车加油*
*Are parking cars and pumping gas*

556
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,393
*在圣何塞你会很轻松*
*You can really breathe in San Jose*

557
00:40:49,394 --> 00:40:51,676
*那里有很多空间*
*They've got a lot of space*

558
00:40:51,677 --> 00:40:54,002
*将会有我的容身之所*
*There'll be a place where I can stay*

559
00:40:54,003 --> 00:40:57,016
*我在圣何塞出生长大*
*I was born and raised in San Jose*

560
00:40:57,017 --> 00:40:59,223
*我要回圣何塞*
*I'm going back to find*

561
00:40:59,224 --> 00:41:01,895
*寻找内心的宁静*
*Some peace of mind in San Jose*

562
00:41:02,058 --> 00:41:04,924
*名望和财富是磁石*
*Fame and fortune is a magnet*

563
00:41:04,925 --> 00:41:09,691
*将你吸引到他乡*
*It can pull you far away from home*

564

《双螺旋》前情提要
Priviously on Helix...

2
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:04,727
昨晚深夜
Late last night,

3
00:00:04,728 --> 00:00:06,947
一个军事情报站收到北极生物公司旗下
a military listening post received a distress call

4
00:00:06,948 --> 00:00:09,813
一家私人研究基地的求救呼叫
from a private research base owned by Arctic Biosystems.

5
00:00:09,814 --> 00:00:11,980
求救内容提及一场可能的逆转录病毒爆发
The call denoted a possible retroviral outbreak.

6
00:00:11,981 --> 00:00:13,950
第三个感染的人是彼得
The third infected patient is Peter.

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:18,889
那就是他前妻吗
That's his ex-wife?

8
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:21,245
他从不提及她或者他弟弟
He never talks about her or his brother.

9
00:00:21,246 --> 00:00:22,512
他不说的原因很可能是因为
That's probably because

10
00:00:22,513 --> 00:00:24,180
他曾将他前妻和弟弟捉奸在床
he caught her and his brother in bed together.

11
00:00:24,383 --> 00:00:26,744
我们相当确定感染并不通过空气传播
We are fairly certain it's not airborne.

12
00:00:26,745 --> 00:00:29,519
彼得  你知道自己发生了什么事吗
Peter, Do you know what happened to you?

13
00:00:33,435 --> 00:00:35,301
这东西不仅能杀人  还能将人彻底湮灭
This thing doesn't kill; it annihilates.

14
00:00:35,523 --> 00:00:36,221
他是怎么逃出去的
How did he get out?

15
00:00:36,492 --> 00:00:37,781
今早他还处在濒死状态
This morning he was terminally ill,

16
00:00:37,782 --> 00:00:39,136
现在却有力气破牢而出
now he's ripping out of restraints?

17
00:00:39,137 --> 00:00:41,179
我们双方的雇主都不会满意的
The people you and I work for aren't happy,

18
00:00:41,482 --> 00:00:43,153
现在我还得收拾你的烂摊子
and now I have to clean up your mess.

10019
00:00:48,104 --> 00:00:52,066
{\an8}第二天

20
00:00:56,547 --> 00:00:59,058
-我们被他感染了吗  -我们会死吗
- Did he infect us? - Are we going to die?

21
00:01:00,607 --> 00:01:02,245
我不清楚发生了什么
I'm not sure what happened.

22
00:01:03,044 --> 00:01:07,553
突然间  彼得...法拉格特博士跳到了我身上
Suddenly, Peter...Dr. Farragut...was on top of me.

23
00:01:08,654 --> 00:01:09,996
他将我压倒在地
He held me down,

24
00:01:10,249 --> 00:01:13,452
把嘴压到我的嘴上  就像野兽一般
put his mouth over mine, like some kind of animal.

25
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:17,560
我从未受过如此的侵犯
I've never felt so violated.

26
00:01:19,405 --> 00:01:21,684
-我快窒息了  -我不能呼吸
- I was choking. - I couldn't bloody breathe.

27
00:01:21,685 --> 00:01:23,490
就像他要闷死我一样
Like he was trying to smother me.

28
00:01:24,777 --> 00:01:26,184
其他人怎样了
What about the others?

29
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:28,877
什么其他人
What others?

30
00:01:28,913 --> 00:01:32,652
当时还有三个人在这里  袭击过后
There were three more in here with us. After the attack...

31
00:01:33,228 --> 00:01:34,438
他们跑了
they ran.

32
00:01:35,389 --> 00:01:36,531
去哪了
Where?

33
00:01:37,073 --> 00:01:38,468
我不知道
I don't know.

34
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,654
告诉我他们的名字
I need their names.

35
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,622
请注意  行动代码425  R层
Attention, Code 425 Level-R.

36
00:01:47,623 --> 00:01:49,374
有疑似感染者逃离了隔离区
We have a containment issue. 

37
00:01:49,415 --> 00:01:52,104
听说了  我已经向x博士申请安保小队
I heard. I've asked Hatake for a security team. 

38
00:01:52,105 --> 00:01:53,236
我们会组织一次搜索
We're mounting a search.

39
00:01:53,237 --> 00:01:54,728
这地方太大了
This place is huge.

40
00:01:54,752 --> 00:01:56,786
如果我们连简单的隔离制度都保证不了
If we can't maintain a simple isolation protocol--

41
00:01:56,787 --> 00:01:58,545
这种情况下可没有简单的事
There's nothing simple about this.

42
00:01:58,546 --> 00:02:01,033
我们还是先关注眼前的问题吧
All right, let's concentrate on what we do know.

43
00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:03,572
我们知道病毒不会通过空气传播
We know the virus is not airborne.

44
00:02:03,892 --> 00:02:04,944
受害者们怎么说
What are the victims saying? 

45
00:02:04,945 --> 00:02:08,253
他们说彼得对他们进行了某种口对口的接触
They're saying that Peter engaged in some kind of oral contact.

46
00:02:08,514 --> 00:02:10,488
就像接吻或者啃咬吗
What, like a kiss or a bite?

47
00:02:10,828 --> 00:02:12,404
更像是一种攻击
More like an assault.

48
00:02:13,821 --> 00:02:16,402
那这病毒的R0系数就变成6了
The R-naught of the virus is now six.

49
00:02:16,752 --> 00:02:18,436
再乘以逃脱的人数
Multiply that times our escapees--

50
00:02:18,437 --> 00:02:21,521
我们可能会有十八个新病例
That's 18 new cases we can look forward to.

51
00:02:21,823 --> 00:02:23,783
我们还不确定彼得是否会再次袭击
We're not even sure Peter's done yet.

52
00:02:27,445 --> 00:02:31,537
茱尔斯  我需要你立刻在老鼠身上进行模拟
Jules, I need you to get started on the rats right away.

53
00:02:31,538 --> 00:02:33,413
我们得明确感染率
We need to find out the rate of infection. 

54
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,861
莎拉  你能在朵琳回来前负责隔离室吗
Sarah, can you handle the isolation unit until Doreen checks in?

55
00:02:36,998 --> 00:02:38,618
没问题
Yeah, absolutely.

56
00:02:38,619 --> 00:02:40,563
如果谁有任何急性病毒综合征的迹象
If you see any signs of acute viral syndrome--

57
00:02:40,564 --> 00:02:43,115
发热  流汗  皮疹  咽喉痛  恶心
Fever, sweats, rash, sore throat, nausea,

58
00:02:43,116 --> 00:02:46,029
呕吐  肌痛  关节痛  淋巴结肿大
vomiting, myalgia, arthralgia, lymphadenopathy...

59
00:02:46,034 --> 00:02:47,243
只要有任何这些症状
Any of that. 

60
00:02:47,305 --> 00:02:50,162
你马上穿上隔离服去找我
You get back into a Racal suit and you find me immediately.

61
00:02:51,764 --> 00:02:53,211
法拉格特博士
Dr. Farragut.

62
00:02:54,914 --> 00:02:56,688
三个失踪的博士
Our three missing doctors,

63
00:02:56,689 --> 00:02:59,171
特蕾西  雷弗和德克勒克
Tracey, Raver, and Deklerk.

64
00:02:59,215 --> 00:03:01,896
他们逃离日光浴室后便不知所踪
No one has seen them since they fled the sunroom.

65
00:03:01,897 --> 00:03:03,694
这真是意料之中的事
Why does that not surprise me?

66
00:03:03,695 --> 00:03:04,805
那你能告诉我
Can you tell me, then, 

67
00:03:04,806 --> 00:03:07,569
在过去八小时中有人试图离开基地吗
if anyone's tried to leave the base in the last eight hours? 

68
00:03:07,572 --> 00:03:08,330
没有
No.

69
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,986
那我们只能用最原始的方法了
Well, then we'll have to do this the old-fashioned way.

70
00:03:10,987 --> 00:03:14,888
我和拜耶塞罗少校会挨层挨屋的去找
Major Balleseros and myself will go floor to floor, room by room.

71
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:18,925
如果他们像你弟弟一样拒绝合作呢
And if they refuse to cooperate? Like your brother?

72
00:03:19,028 --> 00:03:21,911
别忘了我们还没找到他
Let's not forget he's still out there.

73
00:03:21,912 --> 00:03:23,354
我只能尽量说服他们
I'll have to persuade them.

74
00:03:23,355 --> 00:03:25,782
希望你可以  不过以防万一
I hope you can. But just in case,

75
00:03:25,783 --> 00:03:29,395
安保人员会随身携带电棍和束带
our security teams will carry stun batons and restraints. 

76
00:03:29,396 --> 00:03:31,092
你要用武力来制服他们吗
You're going to try to win them over with force?

77
00:03:31,093 --> 00:03:33,793
我只关心这个基地的安全
The safety of this base is my only concern.

78
00:03:33,794 --> 00:03:34,388
好吧
All right,

79
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:36,924
我也不同意用武力解决问题
I don't agree with restraining people any more than you do,

80
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,739
但我们还是先找到他们
but let's just find them first, 

81
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,115
看看能否说服他们以大局为重
see if we can convince them to do what's best for the whole base.

82
00:03:48,496 --> 00:03:50,639
我可以帮你应付那些逃离的病人
You're gonna need my help with those escaped patients. 

83
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,217
实验室里更需要你
Not as much as I need you in the lab. 

84
00:03:52,218 --> 00:03:54,521
感染率远不如隔离重要  你知道的
Rate of infection is secondary to containment. You know that.

85
00:03:54,522 --> 00:03:57,078
过去两年我一直在追踪感染患者
I've been tracking infected patients for the past two years. 

86
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,024
我知道怎么跟他们交流
I know how to talk to them.

87
00:03:58,025 --> 00:04:00,251
-这和你的资历无关  -那和什么有关
- This is not about your qualifications. - Then what is it about?

88
00:04:00,252 --> 00:04:03,453
-这里资源有限  -那都是胡扯
- Our lack of resources up here. - That's bullshit.

89
00:04:03,468 --> 00:04:05,194
你有多久没踏出亚特兰大了
When was the last time you even left Atlanta? 

90
00:04:05,195 --> 00:04:07,155
该死的  茱尔斯  我们不能同时掌权
Damn it, Jules, we cannot both be in charge.

91
00:04:07,156 --> 00:04:09,317
这一次你必须得听我指挥
You'll have to follow my lead on this.

10092
00:05:56,287 --> 00:06:05,827
《双螺旋》第一季第二集

10093
00:06:12,491 --> 00:06:16,489
{\an8}隔离室

94
00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:22,462
我们得在这儿呆多久
How long do we have to be in here? 

95
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,251
最多几周
A couple of weeks at most.

96
00:06:24,252 --> 00:06:26,630
几周  那我的研究怎么办
A couple of weeks? What about my research?

97
00:06:26,631 --> 00:06:28,523
万一我没被感染呢  我跟他们共处一室
What if I'm not infected? I'm in the same room with them.

98
00:06:28,524 --> 00:06:29,972
-呼吸同样的空气  -闭嘴  布赖斯
- We're breathing the same air-- - Shut up, Bryce.

99
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:33,526
大家都冷静一点  我知道你们压力很大
Everybody, please calm down. I know this is very stressful.

100
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:36,487
你能懂什么  你才多大
You don't know anything. How old are you?

101
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,396
我今年二十六岁
I'm twenty-six.

102
00:06:38,516 --> 00:06:39,665
你看起来只有十五岁
You look like you're 15. 

103
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:40,589
我在麻省理工大学
I have two Master's and 

104
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,174
专攻病毒学和生物遗传学
a PhD from MIT specializing

105
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,645
获得两个硕士学位  一个博士学位
in virology and biogenetics.

106
00:06:43,646 --> 00:06:46,051
是十几年来疾控中心雇用的最年轻的博士
I was the youngest doctor hired by the CDC in over a decade,

107
00:06:46,052 --> 00:06:47,648
法拉格特博士让我负责隔离室
and Dr. Farragut put me in charge of isolation 

108
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:49,025
是因为我能胜任
because I'm qualified.

109
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:51,629
我会尽量满足你们的需求
Now, I will do my best to address your needs, 

110
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,208
但是我要声明一件事
but I want to make one thing perfectly clear

111
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:54,794
一切要按规矩走
we will have order here.

112
00:07:00,947 --> 00:07:02,778
我们从特蕾西博士的房间开始
We'll start with Dr. Tracey's room.

113
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:04,553
我会先砸开门进去
I'll breach the door and enter first.

114
00:07:04,554 --> 00:07:06,967
没听到我的指令不要进去
Don't follow until you hear the all-clear.

115
00:07:08,526 --> 00:07:09,659
那是什么
What's that?

116
00:07:10,068 --> 00:07:11,843
电击棍  专门对付北极熊用的
Stun baton. Use 'em on polar bears.

117
00:07:11,844 --> 00:07:13,392
不致命  但冲击力极强
Non-lethal, but they pack a wallop.

118
00:07:13,393 --> 00:07:15,595
这只有碰见熊时才会派上用场吧
Ought to come in handy if we run into any bears.

119
00:07:15,596 --> 00:07:16,867
如果遇上彼得・法拉格特
If we run into Peter Farragut,

120
00:07:16,868 --> 00:07:18,139
你会庆幸我们带了这家伙
you'll be glad we have these.

121
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,175
他把一个人的脑袋拧了下来
He tore off a man's head.

122
00:07:19,176 --> 00:07:20,383
你觉得仅仅靠电击就能制服他吗
You think a shock is gonna stop him?

123
00:07:20,384 --> 00:07:22,585
-莫非你有更好的主意  -是的
- You got a better idea? - Yeah, I do.

124
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,712
不用砸门  不用电棍  我们敲门
No breaching, no batons. We knock on the door.

125
00:07:25,713 --> 00:07:28,335
如果特蕾西博士在屋内  我们好好谈谈
If Dr. Tracey's home, we have a conversation.

126
00:07:28,336 --> 00:07:30,513
要是她没心情交谈呢
And if she's in no mood to converse?

127
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,761
我可不想自己的双手被人砍下来
I've grown kind of fond of my hands.

128
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:41,057
特蕾西博士
Dr. Tracey?

129
00:07:42,352 --> 00:07:43,023
特蕾西博士
Dr. Tracey,

130
00:07:43,024 --> 00:07:45,173
我是疾控中心的艾伦・法拉格特
it's Alan Farragut with the CDC.

131
00:07:51,695 --> 00:07:54,488
这是日光浴室的东西  她来过这里
These are from the sunroom. She was here.

132
00:07:55,451 --> 00:07:57,042
但是她不想呆着这儿
But she didn't want to be.

133
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:00,831
她曾试图逃出去
She was trying to get out.

134
00:08:02,391 --> 00:08:03,893
那她到底去哪了
Then where the hell did she go?

135
00:08:25,907 --> 00:08:27,117
你是谁
Who are you?

136
00:08:28,184 --> 00:08:29,926
朵琳・博伊尔
D-Doreen Boyle.

137
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:34,942
我怎么知道这是不是真名
How do I know that's your real name?

138
00:08:36,138 --> 00:08:38,287
我  我的驾照上就是这名字
I-It's on my driver's license.

139
00:08:38,288 --> 00:08:41,375
上面还有我的真实体重  但我可不会告诉你
I got my real weight on there too, but I'm not telling you that.

140
00:08:43,218 --> 00:08:44,790
谁派你来的
Who sent you here?

141
00:08:46,387 --> 00:08:48,209
我为疾控中心工作
I work for the CDC.

142
00:08:49,182 --> 00:08:51,132
我专门研究传染病
I study infectious diseases.

143
00:08:51,488 --> 00:08:52,619
也许你能帮我
Maybe you can help me--

144
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,882
不准靠近我们  听到没
Don't you come near us! You hear me?

145
00:08:55,696 --> 00:08:59,134
我们  你在和谁说话
Us? Who are you talking to?

146
00:09:00,352 --> 00:09:01,747
你把我脑子都弄糊涂了
You're messing with my head.

147
00:09:01,748 --> 00:09:03,101
我不会伤害你的
I'm not gonna hurt you.

148
00:09:03,623 --> 00:09:06,395
-你需要医生  -我就是博士[医生]
- You need a doctor. - I am a doctor.

149
00:09:06,396 --> 00:09:09,345
所以我正是来带你去隔离...
That's why I'm here-- to take you to isolation--

150
00:09:09,346 --> 00:09:11,435
不不不  不去那儿
No, no, no! Not there.

151
00:09:11,578 --> 00:09:13,473
他们会对我做可怕的事
They do terrible things to you.

152
00:09:13,474 --> 00:09:14,629
不  我不能告诉你
No, I can't tell you.

153
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:17,342
他们会把我弄去白色房间的  像威特博士一样
They'll take me to the White Room, like Dr. Hvit.

154
00:09:17,343 --> 00:09:18,513
我要离开这基地
I want off this base!

155
00:09:18,514 --> 00:09:22,697
你给我弄架直升机来  你答应吗
You get me on the helicopter. You promise me?

156
00:09:24,176 --> 00:09:27,262
没问题  让你坐副驾驶座都行
I'll even get you to sit shotgun.

157
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:30,800
-来吧  我和你一起去  -为什么
- Come on, I'll go with you-- - Why...

158
00:09:33,603 --> 00:09:35,468
你为什么要骗我们
...why would you lie to us?

159
00:09:36,902 --> 00:09:38,731
这里根本没有直升机
There is no helicopter here.

160
00:09:38,732 --> 00:09:40,895
现在是没有  但我可以打电话安排
No, not now, but I can make a call.

161
00:09:40,896 --> 00:09:44,261
你真是个卑鄙无耻的骗子
You are a dirty, filthy liar.

162
00:09:48,763 --> 00:09:50,613
现在我们该怎么处置你呢
Now, what are we gonna do with you?

163
00:10:03,684 --> 00:10:05,084
你没事吧
Are you all right?

164
00:10:07,998 --> 00:10:09,109
没事
Yeah.

165
00:10:10,823 --> 00:10:12,212
我好像听到了什么声音
I thought I heard something.

166
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:15,043
我总忍不住去想彼得可能就在上面
I keep thinking about Peter up there.

167
00:10:15,044 --> 00:10:16,989
那只是基地运作的动静而已
It's just the base settling.

168
00:10:17,982 --> 00:10:20,183
你抵达之后有睡过觉吗
Have you slept since you arrived?

169
00:10:20,702 --> 00:10:22,737
睡了一两个小时吧
Uh, an hour or two.

170
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,351
我没事  真的
I'm fine, really.

171
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:27,988
在北极  睡眠非常重要
Sleep in the Arctic is critical.

172
00:10:28,263 --> 00:10:30,389
不然你会思维混乱的
The mind can play tricks.

173
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:34,897
我会考虑你的建议
I'll take that under advisement.

174
00:10:38,187 --> 00:10:41,202
等等  刚刚是怎么回事
Wait. What just happened?

175
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,620
-你看到了吗  -是的
- Did you see that? - Yes.

176
00:10:53,033 --> 00:10:54,795
那间实验室里发生了什么
What was going on in that lab?

177
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,866
我说过了
I told you.

178
00:10:57,464 --> 00:10:59,936
彼得之前在研究突变原
Peter was researching mutagens.

179
00:11:00,113 --> 00:11:02,705
我想咱们都心知肚明  那不是突变原
I think we both know that was no mutagen.

180
00:11:03,014 --> 00:11:04,697
他到底在研究什么
What was he really working on?

181
00:11:14,953 --> 00:11:16,915
你得让我们出去  这是绑架
You've got to let us out of here. This is kidnapping.

182
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,478
我要见律师
I demand to talk to a lawyer!

183
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:19,768
这是公共卫生危机
This is a public health crisis. 

184
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:21,301
疾控中心有完全管辖权
The CDC has full jurisdiction. 

185
00:11:21,302 --> 00:11:23,451
那你们又做了什么呢
Oh! A hell of a lot of good that's done!

186
00:11:23,452 --> 00:11:25,433
我们自己研究治疗方案都比你们强
We could do a better job of finding a cure ourselves.

187
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,544
消停一会儿吧  布赖斯
Give it a rest, Bryce. 

188
00:11:26,545 --> 00:11:27,220
你才要消停一会儿 
You give it a rest! 

189
00:11:27,221 --> 00:11:27,949
你又不是和那边的
You're not the one who shared a bathroom

190
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,781
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}美国第一位健康带菌者
一生中至少将伤寒传染给50个人以上

191
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,781
"伤寒玛莉"共用卫生间的人
with Typhoid Mary over there.

192
00:11:30,738 --> 00:11:33,190
我很抱歉  别乱动
I'm sorry. Try to keep still.

193
00:11:33,191 --> 00:11:34,096
不然怎样
Or what?

194
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,156
我会病死吗
I'll get sick and die?

195
00:11:37,844 --> 00:11:40,717
一定很严重  你又把防护服穿上了
Must be bad - you put the suit back on.

196
00:11:40,718 --> 00:11:42,731
我们只是不确定究竟面对的是什么
We don't know exactly what we're dealing with.

197
00:11:42,825 --> 00:11:44,426
说不定一切都会没事的
Everything could be fine.

198
00:11:45,409 --> 00:11:48,814
因为不知情  所以一定不会是好事
Not knowing is why things can't be fine.

199
00:11:48,815 --> 00:11:52,630
因为不知情  那两位也会与我敌对
Not knowing is why those two over there are gonna turn on me.

200
00:11:53,861 --> 00:11:55,266
都是迟早的事
It's just a matter of time. 

201
00:11:56,202 --> 00:11:58,437
我不会让你有事的
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

202
00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:00,928
我保证
I promise.

203
00:12:01,574 --> 00:12:04,241
这可不是你能轻易做的保证
That's a promise you don't want to make.

204
00:12:08,084 --> 00:12:10,129
你们这里有硫酸吗啡吗
Do you have morphine sulfate here?

205
00:12:13,177 --> 00:12:15,725
他急需吗啡  我在哪能找到
He needs morphine now. Where do I get it?

206
00:12:15,726 --> 00:12:18,584
G层  药品仓库
Level G, drug stockroom.

207
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:40,821
起来
Get up!

208
00:12:43,585 --> 00:12:44,660
他是谁
Who is it?

209
00:12:45,006 --> 00:12:46,450
从日光浴室逃走的人之一
One of the runners from the sunroom.

210
00:12:46,451 --> 00:12:47,845
他藏在了楼梯井里
He was hiding in the stairwell.

211
00:12:47,846 --> 00:12:50,213
他是气溶胶部门的德克勒克博士
That's Dr. DeKlerk from the aerosol division.

212
00:12:50,214 --> 00:12:51,722
你们没必要对他这么粗鲁
You didn't have to be so rough with him.

213
00:12:51,723 --> 00:12:53,535
谁叫你们不听从指示
Maybe if you people followed directions. 

214
00:12:53,536 --> 00:12:55,945
谁叫你们不告诉我们到底是怎么回事
Maybe if you told us what the hell was going on.

215
00:12:58,988 --> 00:13:01,600
怎么了  他被感染了吗
What's wrong with him? Is he infected?

216
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:03,384
我们不知道  他叫什么
Uh, we don't know. What's his name?

217
00:13:03,385 --> 00:13:05,792
-我说过了  德克勒克  -他的名字呢
- I told you. DeKlerk. - His first name!

218
00:13:06,099 --> 00:13:09,091
-好像是亨里克吧  -亨里克  有我们在
- Uh, Henrik, I think. - Henrik, we're with you.

219
00:13:09,093 --> 00:13:12,397
有我们在  我们会照顾你的  他还有呼吸
We're with you. We'll take care of you. He's still breathing.

220
00:13:12,398 --> 00:13:13,931
把他送去医务室
Get him to sickbay.

221
00:13:15,369 --> 00:13:17,923
没什么好看的  都回去吧
Show's over. Everyone go back to your rooms.

222
00:13:17,924 --> 00:13:19,058
我们为什么还不能撤离
Not until you tell us why

223
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:21,101
你不告诉我们是不会回去的
we haven't been evacuated.

224
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:30,378
让他离我远点
Keep him away from me.

225
00:13:30,963 --> 00:13:32,805
你还没回答我的问题
You didn't answer my question.

226
00:13:32,806 --> 00:13:34,561
我们正在竭尽所能
We're doing the best we can.

227
00:13:34,768 --> 00:13:37,164
放屁  你们可是疾控中心来的人
That's bullshit. You're from the CDC.

228
00:13:37,165 --> 00:13:39,157
要把我们弄出去不是轻而易举的事吗
You could get us out of here if you really wanted to.

229
00:13:39,158 --> 00:13:42,296
你说的对  没错
You know what? You're right. You're right.

230
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:44,515
我们是可以把你们全部撤离
We could evacuate you all,

231
00:13:44,516 --> 00:13:46,264
把你们空运到最近的医院去
airlift you out to the nearest hospital,

232
00:13:46,265 --> 00:13:47,948
但是你们知道接下来会发生什么吗
and you know what would happen then?

233
00:13:47,977 --> 00:13:50,424
首先是那些照顾你们的医生和护士
It would start with the doctors and the nurses -

234
00:13:50,425 --> 00:13:51,774
受到感染
the ones caring for you.

235
00:13:52,342 --> 00:13:53,565
他们回到家中
They'd go home to their families,

236
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:56,417
吻着孩子道晚安  然后将病毒传染给他们
kiss their kids goodnight, and pass on the virus.

237
00:13:56,929 --> 00:13:57,919
第二天在学校里
And the next day at school,

238
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,658
这些孩子又会传染别人
some of those kids would infect others,

239
00:13:59,659 --> 00:14:01,630
两周之后  这病毒
and in two weeks' time, this virus

240
00:14:01,631 --> 00:14:03,274
就会肆虐于人民大众
is in the general population;

241
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:04,814
四周之后
in four weeks,

242
00:14:04,815 --> 00:14:08,151
地球上每座主要城市都会遭殃
every major city on this planet.

243
00:14:11,128 --> 00:14:12,141
所以  不行
So, no,

244
00:14:13,659 --> 00:14:15,373
我们不能将你们撤离
we're not evacuating you.

245
00:14:16,821 --> 00:14:18,976
但我们也没有放弃你们
But we're not abandoning you.

246
00:14:20,153 --> 00:14:21,994
我们会和你们在一起
We will stay with you

247
00:14:23,015 --> 00:14:25,045
直到弄清楚发生了什么
as long as it takes to figure this out.

248
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,814
现在  请各位
Now, please,

249
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,037
回到自己的房间
just go back to your rooms.

250
00:14:37,195 --> 00:14:38,440
说的好
Nice speech.

251
00:14:40,174 --> 00:14:43,727
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}1995年刚果基奎特爆发了埃博拉病毒

252
00:14:40,174 --> 00:14:42,068
自从95年基奎特后
I haven't heard that since...

253
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:43,727
我就没听过你这么说了
Kikwit, '95?

254
00:14:45,696 --> 00:14:48,110
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}1996年南非约翰内斯堡也爆发了埃博拉病毒

255
00:14:45,696 --> 00:14:48,110
那是96年在约堡  你怎么在这里
It was Joburg, '96. What are you doing here?

256
00:14:49,658 --> 00:14:52,257
彼得的实验室里发生了一些怪事
There was something strange going on in Peter's lab.

257
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:53,627
我正在排查监控录像
I've been combing surveillance tape--

258
00:14:53,628 --> 00:14:55,836
我让你去研究感染率
I asked you to work on rate of infection.

259
00:14:55,837 --> 00:14:56,981
但这个看起来更重要
This seemed more important.

260
00:14:56,982 --> 00:14:58,429
我已经说的很清楚了
I thought I made this clear--

261
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,635
到底怎么了  艾伦
What's going on, Alan?

262
00:14:59,931 --> 00:15:01,746
虽说你一直很固执  但至少你以前还讲道理
You were always stubborn, but at least you made sense.

263
00:15:01,747 --> 00:15:04,529
-我们已经谈过了  -是关于彼得的吗
- We talked about this-- - Is this about Peter?

264
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,932
-真荒唐  -你在惩罚我吗
- That's absurd. - Are you punishing me?

265
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,563
相信我  我惩罚自己够多的了
Because believe me, I've punished myself

266
00:15:08,564 --> 00:15:09,560
连你那份也算上了
enough for both of us.

267
00:15:09,561 --> 00:15:11,246
现在不是合适的时间和地点谈这个...
This is not the time, it's not the place--

268
00:15:11,247 --> 00:15:12,874
我们从没有合适的时间地点来解决问题
It was never the time or the place!

269
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,730
这就是我们当初争执的起源
That was the problem to begin with.

270
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,575
茱尔斯
Jules.

271
00:16:01,621 --> 00:16:03,014
你来这里是
You're here for...

272
00:16:05,347 --> 00:16:08,625
-什么  -你来这里是有原因的
- What? - You're here for a reason!

273
00:16:10,218 --> 00:16:13,253
是的  我是
Um... yeah, I'm, uh,

274
00:16:13,254 --> 00:16:14,765
我是疾控中心的人
I'm with the CDC.

275
00:16:17,193 --> 00:16:20,140
-我们是来帮助你的  -不  不是你
- We're here to help you. - No! Not you.

276
00:16:21,828 --> 00:16:23,101
是沃克
Walker.

277
00:16:33,151 --> 00:16:34,401
我找到了这个
Got something here.

278
00:16:34,402 --> 00:16:36,756
过去三个月的注射记录
Injection logs for the last three months.

279
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:40,480
这是与监控录像匹配的当日记录
Here's the date that matches the surveillance tape.

280
00:16:42,311 --> 00:16:45,286
2月19日  他给第14组
February 19th. Lot 14.

281
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:48,748
注射了0.2毫升的纳尔维克-A
He injected 0.2cc's of NARVIK-A.

282
00:16:49,195 --> 00:16:52,808
给第15组注射了0.2毫升的纳尔维克-B
Lot 15, 0.2ccs of NARVIK-B.

283
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:54,291
那是什么
What is that?

284
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:57,760
我常鼓励手下挑战自我
I encourage my staff to push the envelope,

285
00:16:57,927 --> 00:17:01,098
尝试新的未试验过的配方
to try new and untested formulas.

10286
00:17:08,098 --> 00:17:09,930
{\an8}纳尔维克-A

287
00:17:09,934 --> 00:17:12,122
彼得也被注射了这个吗
Was Peter experimenting with this?

288
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:14,345
据我所知没有
Not that I was aware of.

10289
00:17:18,345 --> 00:17:19,345
{\an8}纳尔维克-B

290
00:17:19,492 --> 00:17:21,348
还有谁和他一起在这个实验室工作
Who else worked in this lab with him?

291
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:23,762
你昨天已经见过了
You met both of them yesterday -

292
00:17:24,096 --> 00:17:25,657
停尸袋里那两位
in body bags.

293
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:36,579
我们得重做这实验
We need to replicate the test -

294
00:17:37,263 --> 00:17:40,339
彼得的实验  然后自己分析结果
Peter's research. We can examine the results ourselves.

295
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,483
给更多的老鼠注射
Inject more rats?

296
00:17:42,764 --> 00:17:44,259
然后看结果怎样
And see what happens.

297
00:17:51,123 --> 00:17:52,225
我早该知道的
I should've known.

298
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,552
他们绝不会用它来做好事
They were never gonna use it for something good.

299
00:17:54,553 --> 00:17:57,088
到处移动基因位置
Move a few genes here and there,

300
00:17:57,089 --> 00:17:58,356
再激活复制周期
activate the replication cycle.

301
00:17:58,357 --> 00:18:00,895
大功告成  一个完美的武器诞生了
Bingo, you got yourself the perfect weapon.

302
00:18:00,895 --> 00:18:01,895
这不是我的错  对吗
It wasn't my fault, right?

303
00:18:01,896 --> 00:18:04,404
我怎么知道这事会向坏处发展呢
How was I supposed to know it was gonna go sideways?

304
00:18:04,405 --> 00:18:06,391
你不可能创造出一种病毒
You can't make a virus

305
00:18:06,392 --> 00:18:08,685
还妄想它会听你摆布
and expect it to follow instructions, right?

306
00:18:08,686 --> 00:18:11,489
别装了  你谁也骗不了
Don't play dumb! You're not fooling anyone.

307
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,089
你很清楚你一直以来都干了些什么
You knew what you were doing this whole time.

308
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:16,101
我才不会为这事背黑锅  听见了吗
I am not taking the fall for this alone, you hear me?!

309
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,321
天啊  对不起
Oh, God! I'm sorry.

310
00:18:30,371 --> 00:18:31,984
我是怎么了
What's wrong with me?

311
00:18:38,602 --> 00:18:39,522
莎拉
Sarah!

312
00:18:42,074 --> 00:18:43,379
你还好吧
Are you all right?

313
00:18:44,512 --> 00:18:45,759
不好
Not really.

314
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:49,221
他...碰你了吗  有任何接触吗
Did he... touch you? Make any kind of contact?

315
00:18:49,222 --> 00:18:51,007
他有任何分泌物溅到你身上吗
Did he get any secretions on you?

316
00:18:51,008 --> 00:18:54,212
没有  我没事  他没攻击我
No, I'm... I'm ok. He didn't attack me.

317
00:18:54,229 --> 00:18:56,560
这里有很多空药瓶和注射管
A lot of empty vials and syringes over here.

318
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,640
硫酸吗啡
Morphine sulfate.

319
00:19:00,864 --> 00:19:02,190
他很痛苦
He's in pain.

320
00:19:02,818 --> 00:19:05,426
-这是好现象  -什么
- This is good. - Excuse me?

321
00:19:05,427 --> 00:19:07,193
如果他还有清醒的头脑来自治
If he has the presence of mind to self-medicate,

322
00:19:07,194 --> 00:19:09,074
那也许我们还能在他感染更多人之前
then maybe we can talk him into coming back to isolation 

323
00:19:09,075 --> 00:19:11,113
劝说他回到隔离室
before he infects anyone else.

324
00:19:11,381 --> 00:19:13,106
我不知道  他
I don't know. He...

325
00:19:14,405 --> 00:19:15,819
他那个眼神
he had this look in his eyes...

326
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,944
不太  不太像是人类
It wasn't... it wasn't quite human.

327
00:19:19,561 --> 00:19:20,838
他还做了什么
What else did he do?

328
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:23,780
你是说除了像蜘蛛侠一样爬上笼子吗
You mean aside from climbing this cage like Spiderman?

329
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,168
他说了些东西
He said something.

330
00:19:26,471 --> 00:19:29,012
他说  "你来这里是有原因的"
He said, "You're here for a reason."

331
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:32,268
-不过不是说我  他是指沃克  -茱尔斯
- Only not me, he said Walker. - Jules?

332
00:19:37,627 --> 00:19:39,786
看样子他给我们留下了一条线索
I think he left us a trail to follow.

333
00:19:40,934 --> 00:19:42,568
我去召集一个安保队伍
I'll get a security team.

334
00:19:43,507 --> 00:19:44,819
我和你一起去
I'm going with you.

335
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,324
这次不行  博士
Not this time, Doc.

336
00:19:46,325 --> 00:19:47,596
事情已经失去控制
Things have been getting out of hand, 

337
00:19:47,597 --> 00:19:49,221
你知道我们可不能失去你
and you know we can't afford to lose you.

338
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:51,198
不过倒是可以这样
But I'll tell you what, though.

339
00:19:51,768 --> 00:19:53,422
你来当我的助手如何
How about you be my wingman?

340
00:20:03,189 --> 00:20:05,362
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}出自电影《虎胆龙威》

341
00:20:03,189 --> 00:20:05,362
我总算知道冷冻快餐被加热是什么感觉了
Now I know what a TV dinner feels like.

342
00:20:05,363 --> 00:20:07,849
我想你那时候还没记事吧
I didn't think you were old enough to remember that one.

343
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:11,428
《虎胆龙威》  当然记得  三年级时看的
Die Hard? Sure. Saw it on third grade.

344
00:20:15,246 --> 00:20:16,830
在上边看到什么了吗
You see anything up there yet?

345
00:20:20,746 --> 00:20:23,807
没有  我们怎么知道他还在不在这
Nada. How do we even know he's still up here?

346
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,102
我了解彼得  他还在上边
I know Peter, he's still up there.

347
00:20:26,723 --> 00:20:28,393
你如何肯定
What makes you so sure.

348
00:20:28,806 --> 00:20:31,166
小时候为了躲避喝醉了酒
He used to hide in the attic when we were kids,

349
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:36,999
或者一身怒气的父亲  他经常躲到阁楼上
when our dad was drinking or angry, which was a lot.

350
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:39,705
小声点  别把他吓跑了
Keep the chatter down. We don't want to scare him away.

351
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:42,372
说真的  我觉得被吓的可不是他
No offence, but I don't think he's the one who's scared.

352
00:20:52,476 --> 00:20:55,524
你能往上看吗  我什么都看不到
Will you look up? I can't see anything.

353
00:20:57,075 --> 00:20:58,429
我这也是
Join the club. 

354
00:20:59,203 --> 00:21:00,204
那是什么
What was that?

355
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:01,979
什么是什么
What was what?

356
00:21:06,207 --> 00:21:08,238
把你的头抬高二十度左右
Tilt your head up about 20 degrees.

357
00:21:08,784 --> 00:21:09,999
向左看
Now look left.

358
00:21:13,733 --> 00:21:15,708
这里黑得很  看到了吗
It's dark up here. Get it?

359
00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:18,366
检查正后方  确认他没跟在你后边
Check your six. Make sure he's not behind you.

360
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,524
拜耶塞罗
Balleseros.

361
00:21:56,862 --> 00:21:58,974
-他还好吗  -我不确定
- Is he all right? - I'm not sure.

362
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,695
他受感染了吗
Is he infected?

363
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:08,199
他还有呼吸  身上也没有那些黑玩意
Well, he's still breathing, none of that black shit on him.

364
00:22:10,856 --> 00:22:12,168
脉搏很稳定
His pulse is steady.

365
00:22:19,664 --> 00:22:21,199
上面发生了什么
What happened up there?

366
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,088
我怎么知道  之前我还是一个人
Hell if I know. One minute I was alone,

367
00:22:25,089 --> 00:22:27,472
转眼间就和你兄弟面对面了
the next minute, I'm getting a face full of your brother.

368
00:22:29,235 --> 00:22:31,705
估计我用电棍把我俩都给电晕了
I guess I must have nailed us both with that bug zapper.

369
00:22:31,706 --> 00:22:34,088
那电棍含有60万伏电压
That stun baton packs 600KV.

370
00:22:34,089 --> 00:22:35,241
他应该已经毫无知觉了
It should have knocked him out cold.

371
00:22:35,242 --> 00:22:36,101
看起来很多常理
Seems like a lot of things

372
00:22:36,102 --> 00:22:38,213
已经不能应用到彼得身上了
that should be happening with Peter aren't.

373
00:22:38,861 --> 00:22:39,910
基地一号
Base One.

374
00:22:41,964 --> 00:22:43,138
好的  我们马上去
Ok, we're on our way.

375
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,949
楼上的升降机警报刚刚响了
Elevator alarm just went off upstairs.

376
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,449
有人想要离开基地
Someone's trying to leave the base.

377
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,510
纳尔维克-A组实验对象大量死亡
NARVIK-A subjects are decimated.

378
00:22:52,557 --> 00:22:54,802
接近百分之百的死亡率
Close to a 100% mortality rate.

379
00:22:55,078 --> 00:22:58,696
-纳尔维克-B呢  -百分之百出现病症
- And NARVIK-B? - Morbidity at 100%,

380
00:22:58,697 --> 00:23:00,370
可死亡率为零
mortality at zero.

381
00:23:00,597 --> 00:23:02,635
受了感染但是还活着
They're infected but still alive.

382
00:23:05,368 --> 00:23:08,883
我已经很久没在实验室干过活了
It's been a long time since I did real lab work.

383
00:23:09,003 --> 00:23:10,881
你一定已经忘了它能有多无聊吧
Guess you forget how tedious it can be.

384
00:23:10,882 --> 00:23:12,802
不是  我很怀念
No, I miss it.

385
00:23:13,324 --> 00:23:15,151
那些力求精准
The precision,

386
00:23:15,152 --> 00:23:17,386
全心投入  与不畏牺牲的精神
commitment, sacrifice,

387
00:23:17,387 --> 00:23:20,691
一切都是为了发现新事物的喜悦
all leading to the joy of discovery.

388
00:23:24,948 --> 00:23:27,471
我母亲以前也经常对我这么说
My mother used to say something just like that.

389
00:23:28,243 --> 00:23:30,922
她也是个科学家吗
She was also a scientist?

390
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:33,451
细胞生物学家
Cellular biologist, yeah.

391
00:23:34,892 --> 00:23:36,734
她在我很小的时候就去世了
She died when I was very young.

392
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:38,669
我很遗憾
I am sorry.

393
00:23:40,145 --> 00:23:41,687
你父亲呢
What about your father?

394
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:54,246
天呐
Oh, my god.

395
00:24:08,722 --> 00:24:10,384
你能让他歇会吗
Can't you make him stop?

396
00:24:10,439 --> 00:24:12,878
吗啡不管用  如果我给他更大剂量
Morphine isn't working. If I give him any more,

397
00:24:12,879 --> 00:24:13,994
可能会致死
I might kill him. 

398
00:24:13,995 --> 00:24:15,448
是吗  那听起来也不错
Yeah, maybe that's not such a bad idea.

399
00:24:15,449 --> 00:24:16,303
有点同情心好吗
Nice. 

400
00:24:16,304 --> 00:24:17,379
要是换你躺在那儿
I suppose you'd feel the same way 

401
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,308
看你还能不能说出这种话
if it was you lying there?

402
00:24:18,309 --> 00:24:20,501
我替海文感到难过  但这于事无补
Look, I feel sorry for Haven, but those are the breaks.

403
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:22,412
能别吵了吗  我们要有耐心
Everybody, please. We just need to be patient.

404
00:24:22,413 --> 00:24:23,516
你说得倒轻巧
That's easy for you to say;

405
00:24:23,517 --> 00:24:24,662
你穿着防护服呢
you're back inside that suit.

406
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:25,636
这只是我们研究出治疗方法
This is just a precaution

407
00:24:25,637 --> 00:24:26,972
之前的一种防护措施
until we figure out a treatment.

408
00:24:26,973 --> 00:24:28,849
你根本就没在想治疗方法
You're not figuring out a treatment.

409
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:30,707
说实话  我觉得你对这种病毒
In fact, I don't think you know a damn thing 

410
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:31,861
压根屁都不懂
about this virus at all.

411
00:24:31,862 --> 00:24:36,643
别吵了  我们都是博士  不是吗
Stop it! Stop. We're all doctors here, right?

412
00:24:39,493 --> 00:24:41,973
与其争吵  不如我们群策群力
Instead of bickering, let's put our heads together.

413
00:24:41,974 --> 00:24:45,073
没错  让她放我们出去
Yeah, let's get her to let us out of here.

414
00:24:45,074 --> 00:24:46,341
你知道我不能这么做
You know I can't do that.

415
00:24:46,342 --> 00:24:48,745
你可能会传染给别人或具有攻击性
There's a chance that you could infect others or become violent--

416
00:24:48,746 --> 00:24:51,194
如果这里的人变得有攻击性呢
And what if someone gets violent inside this box,

417
00:24:51,195 --> 00:24:52,667
那我们又该怎么办
What are we supposed to do then?

418
00:24:54,268 --> 00:24:55,154
把门打开
Open the door.

419
00:24:55,155 --> 00:24:57,812
至少让我们回自己的实验室
At least let us go back to our labs.

420
00:24:57,813 --> 00:24:58,819
不行
No.

421
00:25:04,386 --> 00:25:06,606
随你做什么  反正我是不会放你们走的
Do what you want, but I'm not letting you out of here.

422
00:25:06,832 --> 00:25:08,734
那就叫愿意放走我们的人来
Then you're gonna call someone who will.

423
00:25:12,586 --> 00:25:13,602
一号基地
Base One.

424
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:18,193
-好的  我们得回去  -为什么
- OK. We have to go back. - Why?

425
00:25:18,194 --> 00:25:20,845
有几个被隔离的人要求被释放
A couple of detainees are demanding to be let loose.

426
00:25:21,094 --> 00:25:22,589
他们挟持了乔丹博士
They're holding Dr. Jordan.

427
00:25:24,058 --> 00:25:26,089
你去吧  我去检查外面
Go. I'll check outside,

428
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,515
确保周边安全
secure the perimeter.

429
00:25:31,612 --> 00:25:34,317
各安保小队  请确认楼层已封锁
Security teams, confirm level lockdown.

430
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:38,087
立即释放乔丹博士
Release Dr. Jordan at once.

431
00:25:38,088 --> 00:25:39,558
然后我们再谈
Then we can talk. 

432
00:25:39,702 --> 00:25:41,011
放我们出去  我们就放了她
Let us out and she comes with us.

433
00:25:41,012 --> 00:25:41,964
我保证不伤害她
No harm done.

434
00:25:41,965 --> 00:25:43,634
如果你让我们回实验室
If you let us back to our labs, 

435
00:25:43,635 --> 00:25:45,061
我们可以帮忙研究病毒
we can help with the virus.

436
00:25:45,062 --> 00:25:47,278
布赖斯是血液学家  我是生化学家
Bryce is a hematologist; I'm a biochemist.

437
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,687
隔离是为了你们自身的安全
You are in isolation for your own safety.

438
00:25:49,688 --> 00:25:50,907
更像是被关在笼子里的老鼠
More like rats in a box.

439
00:25:50,908 --> 00:25:52,249
我们不会坐以待毙的
We're not gonna die in here.

440
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,734
我们正在研究抗病毒疗法
We are working on an antiviral therapy.

441
00:25:54,735 --> 00:25:56,687
只要动物试验一开始
As soon as we run animal trials--

442
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:58,444
那可能会花上好几周
Animal trials could take weeks!

443
00:25:58,445 --> 00:26:01,906
我们可等不了那么久  你应该明白
We're not going to be around that long, and you know it.

444
00:26:06,927 --> 00:26:08,372
法拉格特博士
Dr. Farragut.

445
00:26:10,501 --> 00:26:12,577
放了乔丹博士
I need you to let Dr. Jordan go.

446
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,308
想都别想  别过来
Uh-uh! Don't come any closer!

447
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:16,826
听着  我们正竭尽全力
Look, we're working as hard as we can

448
00:26:16,868 --> 00:26:20,140
解决问题  不达目的不罢休
to figure this thing out, and we won't stop until we do.

449
00:26:20,141 --> 00:26:21,378
我们才不会信你的鬼话
We both know that's a crock of shit.

450
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:22,616
先让他说完  布赖斯
Hear him out, Bryce.

451
00:26:22,617 --> 00:26:25,409
听我说  我和你们一样在里面
Listen, I'm in here with you;

452
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,712
而不是在外面
not out there.

453
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:28,824
我们会解决的
We will work this out.

454
00:26:28,923 --> 00:26:31,777
好吗  把注射器给我
All right? Just give me the syringe

455
00:26:31,829 --> 00:26:33,636
放开乔丹博士
and let Dr. Jordan go. 

456
00:26:33,636 --> 00:26:35,121
我们凭什么相信你
Why should we trust you?

457
00:26:48,499 --> 00:26:49,901
法拉格特博士
Dr. Farragut.

458
00:26:58,581 --> 00:27:00,303
现在我们没区别了
Now we're in this together.

459
00:27:13,111 --> 00:27:15,006
艾伦  刚才你所做的一切
Alan, what you did back there...

460
00:27:21,183 --> 00:27:22,232
谢谢你
Thank you.

461
00:27:24,044 --> 00:27:25,672
我只是在尽我的职责
I was just doing my job.

462
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,214
你不是也坚守岗位  没放他们出去吗
And so were you by not letting them leave.

463
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,758
-严师出高徒  -是吗  哪个老师
- I had a good teacher. - Yeah? Do I know him?

464
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:37,162
反正也没什么危险
There's no risk anyway,

465
00:27:37,713 --> 00:27:39,846
它不通过空气传播
what with the lack of airborne transmission.

466
00:27:42,547 --> 00:27:43,740
茱尔斯  什么事
Jules, what is it?

467
00:27:45,022 --> 00:27:46,425
我要给你看点东西
I need to show you something.

468
00:27:48,537 --> 00:27:50,826
纳尔维克-A的试验对象死状恐怖
The NARVIK-A subjects died horribly -

469
00:27:50,884 --> 00:27:52,860
机能障碍  失血性休克
lesions, hemorrhagic shock,

470
00:27:52,861 --> 00:27:54,846
内脏溶解
liquification of internal organs.

471
00:27:55,018 --> 00:27:56,873
但纳尔维克-B的试验对象活了下来
But the NARVIK-B subjects didn't die. 

472
00:27:56,874 --> 00:28:00,657
它们高度亢奋  极具攻击性
They became highly aggressive, agitated.

473
00:28:00,658 --> 00:28:02,364
听起来像是狂犬病毒属
Sounds like a lyssavirus.

474
00:28:02,365 --> 00:28:03,745
会不会是狂犬病毒的变体
Maybe some form of rabies? 

475
00:28:03,746 --> 00:28:06,545
狂犬病毒不会强制传染
Rabies doesn't include a compulsion to spread the contagion.

476
00:28:06,546 --> 00:28:08,974
我从没见过哪种病原体
I've never seen a pathogen with such

477
00:28:08,975 --> 00:28:10,887
有这样高度突显的行为模式
focused behavioral patterns.

478
00:28:11,335 --> 00:28:13,338
B实验对象的表现与带菌者一模一样
The B samples are acting just like vectors.

479
00:28:13,339 --> 00:28:14,911
还是服用了兴奋剂的带菌者
Vectors on steroids.

480
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:17,627
我认为B病毒改写了感染者的大脑
I think the B virus rewires the brain

481
00:28:17,628 --> 00:28:20,696
使他们变成了完美的传染机器
to create a perfect contagion machine.

482
00:28:24,432 --> 00:28:25,501
就像彼得一样
Like Peter.

483
00:28:26,027 --> 00:28:29,292
法拉格特博士  x博士想跟您谈谈
Dr. Farragut, Dr. Hatake would like a word with you.

484
00:28:29,293 --> 00:28:30,815
我也正想和他谈谈
And I'd like a word with him.

485
00:28:33,389 --> 00:28:36,156
回到隔离区  查看一下感染患者
Get down to isolation. Check on the infected patients.

486
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,220
如果你所发现属实
If what you've discovered is true,

487
00:28:38,221 --> 00:28:40,691
我们要面对的就不只是病毒
we're not just dealing with a single virus anymore.

488
00:28:50,077 --> 00:28:51,446
要出去遛弯吗
Going for a spin?

489
00:28:52,945 --> 00:28:55,381
今晚可真是够冷的  希望你穿够了衣服
It's a brisk night. I hope you brought your woolies.

490
00:28:56,619 --> 00:28:58,374
这事跟你没关系
This doesn't have anything to do with you.

491
00:28:58,375 --> 00:29:01,514
尽管如此  我还是得请求你回到基地
Still, I'm gonna have to ask you to return back to the base.

492
00:29:02,606 --> 00:29:04,863
要是你知道他们在这干些什么
If you had any idea what they were doing here,

493
00:29:04,864 --> 00:29:07,070
你也会立马逃离这里的
you'd be getting the hell out yourself.

494
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:10,481
转基因实验  病毒库...
The transgenic experiments, the virus vaults...

495
00:29:11,223 --> 00:29:13,568
不受限研究  这些听起来都不错
Unregulated research sounds great

496
00:29:13,569 --> 00:29:15,567
可做起来完全不是这么一回事
until you're actually doing it.

497
00:29:15,568 --> 00:29:20,260
他们在猴子身上做的实验简直丧心病狂
What they did to those monkeys was... was an abomination.

498
00:29:20,776 --> 00:29:22,923
回基地吧  把这些一五一十跟我说说
Come back inside. I want to hear about this.

499
00:29:22,924 --> 00:29:24,615
我不会回去的
I'm not going back.

500
00:29:26,566 --> 00:29:29,068
回来再说吧  你在外面会冻僵的
Just come back inside. You're gonna freeze out here.

501
00:29:29,069 --> 00:29:31,391
人们有权知道这里发生了什么
People have to know what's going on up here.

502
00:29:31,535 --> 00:29:34,712
我们得告诉媒体  告诉所有人
We have to tell the newspapers. Hell, we have to tell everyone.

503
00:29:57,535 --> 00:29:58,517
你没事吧
You OK?

504
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,772
我很好
Yeah, I'm fine.

505
00:30:01,498 --> 00:30:03,296
你不需要马上投入工作的
You don't have to go back in there right now.

506
00:30:03,297 --> 00:30:04,423
我一个人就行
I can handle it.

507
00:30:05,666 --> 00:30:06,862
我没事  谢谢
I'm good, thanks.

508
00:30:09,716 --> 00:30:12,201
来帮个忙吧  这位是特蕾西博士
A little help? Meet Dr. Tracey.

509
00:30:12,202 --> 00:30:13,618
她已经到晚期了
She's in the advanced stages,

510
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:15,946
但我给了她一针镇定剂
but I got her tranked up on monkey juice.

511
00:30:16,063 --> 00:30:17,385
费了好大的劲
Took me a long damn time

512
00:30:17,386 --> 00:30:18,759
才把她弄上来
to haul her ass up here.

513
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,626
而且我还知道了这里一些见不得人的事情
And there's some other monkey business

514
00:30:20,627 --> 00:30:22,424
我想法拉格特博士会感兴趣的
I think Dr. Farragut would like to hear about.

10515
00:30:28,688 --> 00:30:32,982
{\an8}隔离区

516
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:40,213
你们不会打算把她也关这吧
You're not bringing her in here, are you?

517
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:41,980
她会被直接送进重症监护室
She's going straight into the ICU chamber.

518
00:30:41,981 --> 00:30:43,467
你们不会有任何接触的
You won't have any contact.

519
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,347
现在才这么做晚了点吧
A little late for that, isn't it?

520
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,889
他在抽搐  我需要一套急救设备
He's seizing! I need a crash cart!

521
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:55,920
我这就去
Got it!

522
00:30:56,182 --> 00:30:57,440
现在动手
Do it now.

523
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:04,953
快跑  咱们得赶紧离开这里
Come on, let's get out of here!

524
00:31:07,368 --> 00:31:07,898
抱歉  亲爱的
Sorry, love.

525
00:31:30,913 --> 00:31:35,054
在疾控中心来之前情况并没如此严重
This virus was less of a danger before the CDC arrived.

526
00:31:35,397 --> 00:31:37,266
我的人才是受害者
My people were the ones attacked in there.

527
00:31:37,267 --> 00:31:38,886
正是被你的人袭击的
Yours were doing the attacking.

528
00:31:39,204 --> 00:31:42,273
我以为你能控制这里的状况
I thought you had that situation under control.

529
00:31:42,926 --> 00:31:44,432
看来是我高估你了
I was mistaken.

530
00:31:44,433 --> 00:31:46,637
我也以为你会对我毫无隐瞒
And I thought we had the full picture,

531
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:48,821
更别提说好的全面授权了
not to mention complete access.

532
00:31:49,525 --> 00:31:51,774
或许你能向我解释为什么这里的病人
Maybe you can tell me how it is that patients here

533
00:31:51,775 --> 00:31:53,621
总是会离奇不见
just go missing,

534
00:31:54,117 --> 00:31:56,625
或者为什么我的队员
or how a member of my team

535
00:31:56,626 --> 00:31:58,751
会被一只本不该存在的
is attacked by an infected monkey

536
00:31:58,752 --> 00:32:01,432
受感染的猴子袭击
she was told didn't exist in the first place.

537
00:32:02,831 --> 00:32:05,021
或者你是否愿意告诉我
Or maybe you'd like to tell me why

538
00:32:05,219 --> 00:32:09,503
我弟弟为什么会在他自己的实验室
my brother was tinkering with maybe the worst contagion

539
00:32:09,504 --> 00:32:12,427
研究一种前所未有的危险传染病毒
this world has seen in his own damn lab?

540
00:32:12,634 --> 00:32:14,411
这事你该去问你弟弟
You should ask your brother.

541
00:32:15,849 --> 00:32:19,248
我绝不会鼓励下属如此鲁莽
I would never encourage something so reckless.

542
00:32:24,428 --> 00:32:26,223
当下要紧的是
First things first:

543
00:32:26,807 --> 00:32:29,644
我们要如何隔离受感染的患者
how do we contain the infected patients?

544
00:32:30,009 --> 00:32:33,955
除非你对我开诚布公  不然没有任何办法
We don't, not without complete transparency.

545
00:32:34,673 --> 00:32:36,620
我要是拒绝呢
And if I refuse?

546
00:32:38,758 --> 00:32:41,735
我们是来帮忙的  你想靠自己解决问题
We came here to help. You no longer want that help?

547
00:32:41,736 --> 00:32:44,737
行  但是看起来除了我们你也别无所靠了
That's fine. But it seems to me we're the last chance you have.

548
00:32:46,692 --> 00:32:50,489
所以  如果我们能互相帮助
So, maybe we give each other what we want

549
00:32:50,631 --> 00:32:52,060
或者说各取所需
what we need...

550
00:32:52,659 --> 00:32:55,661
或许我们还能活着离开这里
and just maybe we all get out of here alive.

551
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:21,943
-抱歉  -为什么  又不是你的错
- I'm sorry. - For what? It's not your fault.

552
00:33:25,648 --> 00:33:26,902
我没保护好你
I should've been there.

553
00:33:27,583 --> 00:33:30,185
别气馁  我们会找到他们的
Ah, don't beat yourself up. We'll get them back.

554
00:33:32,725 --> 00:33:35,306
我不是因为彼得才拒绝你参加搜寻
I didn't keep you off the search because of Peter.

555
00:33:35,307 --> 00:33:36,451
我是不想再...
I didn't want to...

556
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,598
我已经失去过你一次了
I lost you once.

557
00:33:51,716 --> 00:33:54,298
我很感激你对我的照顾  真的
I appreciate that, I do.

558
00:33:56,511 --> 00:33:58,855
但我不再是你的责任了
But I'm not your responsibility anymore.

559
00:34:01,926 --> 00:34:03,946
你不能一直这样保护我
You can't keep trying to protect me.

560
00:34:07,275 --> 00:34:08,851
我没法控制自己不这么做
I don't know that I can stop.

561
00:36:24,822 --> 00:36:26,214
茱莉亚
Julia.

562
00:36:28,132 --> 00:36:29,119
彼得
Peter.

563
00:36:57,243 --> 00:36:59,180
不要
No. No!

564
00:37:00,526 --> 00:37:02,424
求求你  彼得  不要
Please! Peter! Please!

1
00:00:01,235 --> 00:00:02,455
《双螺旋》前情提要
Previously on Helix...

2
00:00:02,455 --> 00:00:04,045
彼得为什么袭击他
Why did Peter attack this man?

3
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:05,965
为什么病原体会让他变强
And why is the pathogen - making him stronger?

4
00:00:05,975 --> 00:00:07,205
通过验尸
Pending necropsy,

5
00:00:07,205 --> 00:00:10,405
我们也许找到了病源
I believe we may have found the source of the contagion.

6
00:00:10,415 --> 00:00:12,405
这种突变只发生在一小部分样品上
This mutation only occurs in a fraction of the samples.

7
00:00:12,405 --> 00:00:15,075
尽管很少  但在统计学来说仍然相关
It's minimal, but it's statistically relevant.

8
00:00:17,765 --> 00:00:20,255
-这会对他产生什么影响  -把门打开
- But what's it doing to him? - Open the door.

9
00:00:20,255 --> 00:00:22,655
-不行  -快跑
- No. - Come on! Now!

10
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:25,055
人们有权知道这里发生了什么
People have to know what's going on up here!

11
00:00:26,255 --> 00:00:27,205
彼得
Peter.

10012
00:00:30,505 --> 00:00:35,115
{\an8}第三天

13
00:00:59,405 --> 00:01:00,425
没事了
It's all right.

14
00:01:01,245 --> 00:01:02,225
艾伦
Alan?

15
00:01:02,255 --> 00:01:03,635
没事了  放轻松
It's all right. Relax.

16
00:01:11,675 --> 00:01:12,325
怎么回事
What happened?

17
00:01:12,325 --> 00:01:15,075
你告诉我啊  我发现你晕倒在这里
You tell me. I found you here passed out.

18
00:01:15,235 --> 00:01:18,065
-你还记得什么  -我在...
- What do you remember? - Uh, I was, uh...

19
00:01:19,505 --> 00:01:20,965
我在...
I... I was, uh...

20
00:01:22,395 --> 00:01:24,985
洗澡  消毒程序
taking a shower-decontamination procedures

21
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:27,165
然后...
and... and...

22
00:01:34,355 --> 00:01:35,525
我...
I, uh...

23
00:01:37,035 --> 00:01:38,255
我...
I...

24
00:01:39,395 --> 00:01:42,025
-茱尔斯  -我一阵头晕  就不记...
- Jules. - I just felt lightheaded. I don't remem...

25
00:01:42,025 --> 00:01:43,735
不记得接着发生什么事了
I don't remember what happened next.

26
00:01:46,065 --> 00:01:47,575
也许是
I guess I, um...

27
00:01:47,805 --> 00:01:49,955
我没意识到自己有多疲惫
I didn't realize how exhausted I am.

28
00:01:51,455 --> 00:01:54,785
我们的确压力很大
Well, we've... all been pushing really hard.

29
00:01:56,435 --> 00:01:58,085
你得去睡几小时
You need to get a few hours' sleep.

30
00:01:58,085 --> 00:01:59,715
这时候我需要你全神贯注
I need you 100% for this one.

31
00:01:59,715 --> 00:02:03,865
-好主意  -我送你回房
- OK, good idea. - I'll walk you back to your quarters.

32
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:07,205
彼得还逃窜在外  独自一人不安全
With Peter roaming around out there, it's not safe to go alone.

33
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:09,485
我出去等你
I'll give you a moment.

34
00:02:45,435 --> 00:02:46,385
有人吗
Hello?

35
00:02:50,365 --> 00:02:51,595
这里有人吗
Anybody in here?

36
00:03:35,155 --> 00:03:38,015
救...  我
Help... me.

10037
00:03:47,635 --> 00:03:57,035
《双螺旋》
第一季第三集

38
00:04:33,265 --> 00:04:37,405
如果发现皮损  流感样症状或排出黑色黏液
Please report to me immediately if you see any skin lesions,

39
00:04:37,615 --> 00:04:41,115
请立刻向我报告
flu-like symptoms, or black mucus discharge.

40
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:44,745
我们不用注射抗病毒剂吗  比如
Should we not be taking antivirals? Like...

41
00:04:44,745 --> 00:04:47,775
-奥司他韦  -那是H1N1流感用的
- Oseltamivir? - That's for H1N1 influenza.

42
00:04:47,905 --> 00:04:50,195
我们已经排除这个作为感染原因的可能性了
We've ruled that out as a cause of infection.

43
00:04:50,365 --> 00:04:53,555
-那到底是什么  -没事的
- What is it then? - It's all right.

44
00:04:54,105 --> 00:04:57,385
吃错药比不吃药更糟糕
Taking the wrong meds can do more harm than no meds at all.

45
00:04:57,495 --> 00:04:59,655
我们已经在加紧研究治疗方法了
We're working 'round the clock on a treatment,

46
00:04:59,655 --> 00:05:00,955
一旦研发出来
and when we find it,

47
00:05:01,675 --> 00:05:03,605
就会狠狠击退病毒
we'll attack the virus aggressively.

48
00:05:11,035 --> 00:05:13,145
我明白他们很害怕
Now, they are scared; I get that.

49
00:05:13,925 --> 00:05:16,185
但有时真想冲他们吼一嗓子
But sometimes I just want to yell at 'em, you know?

50
00:05:16,515 --> 00:05:17,915
他们的敌人又不是我们
We're not the enemy here.

51
00:05:27,015 --> 00:05:29,285
安保队还在不断搜寻
Security teams are doing constant sweeps.

52
00:05:29,285 --> 00:05:32,045
还是不见三个出逃的人或彼得・法拉格特的踪影
Still no sign of our three escapees or Peter Farragut.

53
00:05:32,045 --> 00:05:33,945
G层发生了另一起袭击事件
And another attack has been reported on Level G-

54
00:05:33,945 --> 00:05:35,725
两人可能受到感染
two more possibly infected.

55
00:05:35,785 --> 00:05:37,305
已经将他们转移到隔离室了
They're being moved to isolation.

56
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,995
楼层封锁已经32小时了
We've been in lockdown for 32 hours.

57
00:05:52,005 --> 00:05:53,495
大伙都慌了
People are panicking.

58
00:05:53,705 --> 00:05:57,215
如果不做出些改变  也许基地会失控
If something doesn't change, we risk losing control of the base.

59
00:05:57,215 --> 00:05:59,055
茱莉亚・沃克在哪
Where is Julia Walker?

60
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:04,235
不清楚  你要跟她谈话吗
I... I'm not sure. Do you want to speak to her?

61
00:06:05,605 --> 00:06:07,275
不用了
That won't be necessary.

62
00:06:15,495 --> 00:06:16,775
法拉格特博士
Dr. Farragut.

63
00:06:17,215 --> 00:06:19,375
-你干什么  -把我哥哥隔离起来
- What are you doing? - Getting my brother into containment.

64
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,835
为什么不通知我们
Why didn't you inform us?

65
00:06:20,835 --> 00:06:24,325
我以为你派来跟着我的人会告诉你呢
Because I presumed the man you had following me would tip you off.

66
00:06:24,575 --> 00:06:27,545
给他做肝功能化验  全血计数差异比较
I want a full workup lFT, CBC with differential,

67
00:06:27,545 --> 00:06:28,855
凝血因子  病毒检查
coags, viral screen,

68
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:31,405
以及所有能做的抗原-抗体化验
and all available - antigen-antibody assays.

69
00:06:31,405 --> 00:06:34,315
我的安保人员都招架不住他  你怎么做到的
My security teams couldn't wrangle him. How did you manage it?

70
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,445
是他主动来找的我
He turned himself in.

71
00:06:46,235 --> 00:06:48,005
彼得情况怎么样
What is Peter's status?

72
00:06:49,105 --> 00:06:50,405
暂时稳定了
Stable for now.

73
00:06:50,405 --> 00:06:52,935
我问的是镇静情况
I meant the status of his sedation.

74
00:06:52,935 --> 00:06:57,015
-我们可不想再出一次安全事故了  -不太可能
- We don't want - another security incident. - That's unlikely.

75
00:06:57,135 --> 00:07:00,135
就跟砍下一个人的手  使用他的识别芯片
As unlikely as cutting off a man's hand

76
00:07:00,135 --> 00:07:02,645
一样不可能吗
to access his RFID chip?

77
00:07:02,645 --> 00:07:06,135
彼得投降了  没有反抗  没有挣扎
Peter gave himself up; no fight, no struggle.

78
00:07:06,345 --> 00:07:08,195
如果他要逃跑  何必如此大费周章
Why would he do that - if he were planning to escape?

79
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:10,855
我们上次隔离他时也是这么想的
That's what we thought - the last time we put him in isolation.

80
00:07:11,275 --> 00:07:14,205
看样子吗啡对他有用
He appears to be controllable on morphine.

81
00:07:14,355 --> 00:07:15,835
我给他接上止痛泵了
I've hooked him up to a pain pump.

82
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,235
他不会威胁到任何人
He shouldn't - be a danger to anyone.

83
00:07:17,235 --> 00:07:20,555
-我不愿意冒这个风险  -我也是
- I'm not willing - to take that chance. - Neither am I.

84
00:07:24,165 --> 00:07:26,415
有更安全的地方隔离他吗
Is there somewhere more secure we can hold him?

85
00:07:26,835 --> 00:07:29,635
这层楼是北极生物公司的第一期工程
This floor was phase one of Arctic Biosystems.

86
00:07:30,405 --> 00:07:32,655
公司日益壮大  这栋建筑也逐日扩张
As the company grew, so did the facility.

87
00:07:32,655 --> 00:07:35,755
R层包括早期实验室  宿舍
Level R contains our early labs and living quarters,

88
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,815
还有维持整个基地的设备
along with maintenance for the entire base.

89
00:07:39,015 --> 00:07:40,875
二氧化碳净化器
The Co2 oxygen scrubbers,

90
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,405
保暖系统  装备储蓄库
the heating systems, equipment storage,

91
00:07:43,405 --> 00:07:46,295
很多实验室已经转移到了上层
though most of the lab works has moved upstairs.

92
00:07:55,485 --> 00:07:58,585
这里只进行一些敏感和危险的研究
Now we use this level for sensitive and hazardous research.

93
00:07:58,585 --> 00:08:02,005
这里的实验室应该能满足你的安全需求
One of the empty labs should provide the security you're looking for.

94
00:08:02,425 --> 00:08:03,785
这间屋子里的通风系统
The ventilation system in this room

95
00:08:03,785 --> 00:08:06,085
是独立于整个设施的
is separate from the rest of the facility.

96
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:09,885
混凝土墙壁  三英尺宽
The walls are concrete, three feet thick,

97
00:08:09,885 --> 00:08:11,425
而门则是双倍加厚的钢板
and the door is double-plated steel.

98
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:13,165
没什么能够来去自如
Nothing is getting in or out.

99
00:08:13,175 --> 00:08:15,785
什么样的实验需要用到核反应堆
What kind of research were you conducting with nuclear reactors?

100
00:08:19,615 --> 00:08:20,915
我在森迪亚实验室呆过一阵子
I spent time at Sandia Labs.

101
00:08:19,615 --> 00:08:20,915
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}美国核武器实验室

102
00:08:20,915 --> 00:08:23,175
墙上这些烧痕看起来很相似
The burn patterns on these walls are virtually identical.

103
00:08:24,585 --> 00:08:25,995
受控聚变
Controlled fusion,

104
00:08:26,365 --> 00:08:27,905
已经被遗弃的计划
a project we abandoned.

105
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:30,125
上一次辐射检查是什么时候
When was the last radiation screen down here?

106
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,315
我们每半年检查一次
We test every six months,

107
00:08:31,315 --> 00:08:33,615
而这实验室至少已经空了五年
and the lab has been empty - for about five years.

108
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:35,585
也就是说很安全了
So it's safe?

109
00:08:35,585 --> 00:08:39,515
相当的  足够给彼得用作隔离室的了
Perfectly. More than qualified to be an isolation unit for Peter.

110
00:08:40,355 --> 00:08:42,015
以及其他所有人
For everyone else as well.

111
00:08:42,885 --> 00:08:45,785
这层有很多空房间  地方很大
There are empty rooms on this level, plenty of space,

112
00:08:46,115 --> 00:08:49,605
而这个加固实验室可以用来分隔带菌者
and this secure lab allows us - to separate vectors

113
00:08:49,605 --> 00:08:52,805
-与那些被感染者  -带菌者
- from those who are just infected. - Vectors?

114
00:08:52,815 --> 00:08:55,185
就是我们用来称呼彼得那种
It's what we're calling the infected who are...

115
00:08:55,345 --> 00:08:59,115
使用武力来进行病毒传播的感染者
physically attacking others to spread the disease, like Peter.

116
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,325
我想这里可以实现全面隔离
I think we can achieve full containment down here.

117
00:09:03,015 --> 00:09:04,185
你是什么意思
Well, what are you saying?

118
00:09:05,225 --> 00:09:09,185
我的意思是把R层变成隔离楼层
I'm saying we turn Level R into an isolation floor.

119
00:10:30,855 --> 00:10:32,535
打起精神  茱尔斯
Get it together, Jules.

120
00:10:34,685 --> 00:10:38,685
你  没有  生病
You don't... get... sick.

121
00:10:48,835 --> 00:10:52,055
十八位病患已进行隔离  包括彼得
All right, we have 18 sick in isolation, including Peter.

122
00:10:52,055 --> 00:10:54,945
还有三名逃跑两名潜在患者  一共23名
With three on the loose and two presumed infected, that's 23.

123
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:55,625
只是目前已知的
That we know of.

124
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,535
我想把他们都转移到R层
I want to move them all down to Level R.

125
00:10:57,545 --> 00:10:58,615
我需要医疗设备
I'll need medical equipment.

126
00:10:58,615 --> 00:11:01,105
将一间实验室改成分诊部
Turn one of the labs into a triage unit.

127
00:11:01,105 --> 00:11:03,575
我需要足够四十人用的食物水和寝具
I'll need food, water, bedding, for 40 patients.

128
00:11:03,575 --> 00:11:06,165
感染规模肯定会在完全隔离前扩大
This thing will get bigger before we achieve full containment.

129
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,045
我想这些我们能安排
I think we can accommodate that.

130
00:11:12,295 --> 00:11:15,015
救我  救我
Help me. Help me.

131
00:11:15,015 --> 00:11:18,115
-站那别动  -抱歉我跑了  他们逼我的
- Stay where you are. - I'm sorry I ran. They made me do it.

132
00:11:18,115 --> 00:11:19,305
-我们能帮你  -他们逼我的
- We can help. - They made me!

133
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:22,625
-不要再走了  -相信我  他们逼我
- You need to stop. - Believe me. They made me...

134
00:11:38,005 --> 00:11:40,095
拿个担架过来  然后去找查普林医生
Bring a gurney and find Dr. Chaplin.

135
00:11:40,095 --> 00:11:42,535
不  没时间了  她陷入休克了
No! There's no time. She's going into shock.

136
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,505
给我找把手术刀和用来包扎伤口的东西
Find me a scalpel and something to pack into the wound.

137
00:11:50,135 --> 00:11:53,045
保持清醒  你会没事的  快点
Stay with me now. You'll be ok. Hurry up!

138
00:12:05,335 --> 00:12:06,775
好  我摸到子弹了
All right, I feel the bullet.

139
00:12:06,995 --> 00:12:09,785
按住这条血管  按住这条血管
Here, pinch off this vein. Pinch off this vein!

140
00:12:11,485 --> 00:12:15,255
好的  用点力  就是这  我拿到了
Yes. More pressure. Right there. I have it, I have it.

141
00:12:19,345 --> 00:12:20,275
好的
Good.

142
00:12:23,115 --> 00:12:24,335
你会没事的
You're gonna be fine now.

143
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,625
她情况足够稳定  可以进行转移了
She should be stable enough to move.

144
00:12:27,185 --> 00:12:28,795
把她转移到聚变实验室去
We take her down to the fusion lab.

145
00:12:29,325 --> 00:12:30,445
多亏了你的敏捷思维
Thanks to your quick thinking.

146
00:12:30,445 --> 00:12:33,635
我的敏捷思维本该是不需要的
My quick thinking shouldn't have been necessary in the first place.

147
00:12:36,925 --> 00:12:39,335
好了  来吧
All right. Come on. Come on!

148
00:12:40,515 --> 00:12:43,135
她没有武器并且在向我们呼救
She was unarmed and asking for our help.

149
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,465
我只是想保护x博士
I was only trying to protect Dr. Hatake.

150
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,505
她不是在威胁他  她是被吓坏了
She wasn't threatening him. She was scared.

151
00:12:47,505 --> 00:12:48,845
当时事态紧急
The situation was escalating.

152
00:12:48,845 --> 00:12:50,355
事态一点都不紧急  直到你小题大做
It didn't escalate until you panicked

153
00:12:50,355 --> 00:12:52,515
差点谋杀一位受感染的病人
and almost murdered an infected patient!

154
00:12:52,515 --> 00:12:54,505
这基地的规则是我定的
I set the rules on this base.

155
00:12:55,145 --> 00:12:57,735
这里没有国家  没有法律
There are no countries here, no laws.

156
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:01,395
苏勒玛尼博士生死由我负责  不是丹尼尔
Dr. Sulemani's life is my responsibility, not Daniel's.

157
00:13:01,395 --> 00:13:03,615
作为这件案子中经验最丰富的学者
As senior scientist on this case,

158
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:06,015
每位病人的生命都是我的一份责任
every patient's life is my responsibility.

159
00:13:06,015 --> 00:13:09,635
告诉你的那些安保队员这将是最后一次
You tell your security people that this is the last time

160
00:13:09,635 --> 00:13:12,455
在我的病人身上使用致命武力
lethal force is to be used on one of my patients!

161
00:13:12,655 --> 00:13:15,185
-我无法保证  -你管好他们
- I can't guarantee that. - You tell them!

162
00:13:15,335 --> 00:13:16,665
不然我就带走我的小组
Or I'll pull my team,

163
00:13:16,665 --> 00:13:20,195
然后等六个月之后回来做尸检
and we can do this again in six months' time as a postmortem!

164
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:40,035
你对我做了什么  彼得
What did you do to me, Peter?

165
00:13:45,315 --> 00:13:46,455
你做了什么
What did you do?

166
00:14:14,765 --> 00:14:16,425
痛
...Pain...

167
00:14:46,235 --> 00:14:47,325
我们封锁楼梯间
We seal off the stairwells,

168
00:14:47,325 --> 00:14:49,345
用电梯来当气阀
use the elevator for an airlock,

169
00:14:49,345 --> 00:14:51,555
只要控制住楼层入口
and once we control access to the floor,

170
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,945
我们就有了一个隔离室
we should have a viable isolation unit.

171
00:14:53,945 --> 00:14:56,645
健康的留在楼上  受感染的去楼下
So, healthy people come upstairs, sick people go down.

172
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:57,525
没准有用
It might work.

173
00:14:57,525 --> 00:14:59,395
但如果有些人还未显现出症状
But if people aren't showing symptoms yet,

174
00:14:59,405 --> 00:15:00,755
怎么能知道他们是否被感染
how do we know who's infected?

175
00:15:00,755 --> 00:15:04,005
我们需要一个测试  还得是立马可行的测试
We'll need a test, something that we can administer quickly.

176
00:15:04,005 --> 00:15:06,325
最快的是做快速反应测试
A rapid-response test would be the fastest.

177
00:15:07,275 --> 00:15:10,195
但首先我们得找出病毒纯样
But first we need to synthesize a pure sample of the virus.

178
00:15:10,195 --> 00:15:11,085
两种病毒都要
Both viruses.

179
00:15:11,085 --> 00:15:13,075
彼得实验室里找到的实验病毒有什么发现
What about those vials you found in Peter's lab?

180
00:15:13,075 --> 00:15:14,395
从现有的数据库来看
Neither NARVIK-A nor B

181
00:15:14,395 --> 00:15:17,135
纳尔维克-A和B都不是病原体
show up as a pathogen in any existing database.

182
00:15:17,615 --> 00:15:20,035
纳尔维克-B就是让实验鼠群
NARVIK-B is the strain that created the vectors

183
00:15:20,035 --> 00:15:21,805
变成带菌者的那个菌株  是吗
in the rat population, right?

184
00:15:21,805 --> 00:15:24,315
基于那个变体  设计出测试需要多久
How long to synthesize a test based on that variant?

185
00:15:24,315 --> 00:15:26,935
做出可行的测试至少要八个小时
Eight hours at least for something functional.

186
00:15:26,935 --> 00:15:28,795
好  给你四小时  和乔丹合作
Well, you have four. Work with Jordan.

187
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:30,745
那只受感染的猴子身上还有什么信息吗
Tell me more about this infected monkey.

188
00:15:30,945 --> 00:15:33,245
我觉得猴子体内的病毒是关键
I think the virus inside the monkey is the key.

189
00:15:33,245 --> 00:15:35,025
我正在对它的全部基因组进行排序
I'm sequencing the full genome now.

190
00:15:35,045 --> 00:15:37,845
如果我们能证明传染病是从猴子传染到人的
If we can prove that the infection passed from monkey to human...

191
00:15:37,845 --> 00:15:40,145
那我们对原始菌株的了解就更近了一步
it gets us one step closer to the original strain.

192
00:15:40,145 --> 00:15:41,955
这样我们才有机会找到疫苗
And the best shot we have at a vaccine.

193
00:15:41,965 --> 00:15:43,595
好  开始工作吧
All right, get started on it.

194
00:15:43,595 --> 00:15:45,855
我和她一起去  现在我们要加倍小心
I'll go with her; can't be too careful right now.

195
00:15:45,895 --> 00:15:47,755
谢了  但我能保护好自己
Thanks, but I can take care of myself.

196
00:15:47,755 --> 00:15:49,535
朵琳  让他跟你一起
Doreen, take him with you.

197
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,345
大家听好
All right, everybody,

198
00:15:51,345 --> 00:15:55,425
通信系统在6小时42分钟以后将会连通
the com link window goes live in six hours and 42 minutes.

199
00:15:55,425 --> 00:15:58,525
如果我们到时能把相关数据传到亚特兰大
If we have this data to upload to Atlanta,

200
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:00,075
或许就能战胜这次危机
we might just get on top of this thing.

201
00:16:00,075 --> 00:16:01,145
去干活吧
Let's get to work.

202
00:16:24,145 --> 00:16:28,075
20包盐水  改成30包
And 20 bags - make that 30 bags - of saline drip.

203
00:16:28,705 --> 00:16:30,835
基地的医生已经检查过苏勒玛尼博士了
Our base doctor's seen Dr. Sulemani.

204
00:16:31,745 --> 00:16:32,895
她会撑过去的
She's gonna make it.

205
00:16:34,055 --> 00:16:36,555
好  让他持续给她注射异丙酚[麻醉药物]
Well, have him keep her on a propofol infusion.

206
00:16:36,845 --> 00:16:38,475
苏勒玛尼的事件我并没有小题大做
I didn't panic with Sulemani.

207
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:43,995
她感染了致命病毒  企图攻击x博士
She was infected with a lethal virus and coming at Dr. Hatake.

208
00:16:44,365 --> 00:16:46,475
我权衡轻重之后才开了枪
I assessed the options and I pulled the trigger.

209
00:16:46,475 --> 00:16:48,025
感染了就得挨枪子
We shoot everyone who's infected?

210
00:16:48,025 --> 00:16:48,655
是这样吗
Is that it?

211
00:16:48,655 --> 00:16:51,015
-来消除威胁  -是的  如果有这个必要
- Eliminate the threat? - If necessary.

212
00:16:51,025 --> 00:16:54,215
那些潜在的感染者呢  也要杀了他们吗
And those who might be infected? Do we kill them too?

213
00:16:58,615 --> 00:17:00,175
你没开枪的原因
The only reason you didn't fire that shot

214
00:17:00,175 --> 00:17:02,105
是因为你手里没枪
is because the gun wasn't in your hands.

215
00:17:10,555 --> 00:17:13,655
维修组  请速到B层生活区
Maintenace team to living quarters, level B.

216
00:17:17,845 --> 00:17:19,945
又是假阳性结果
Another false positive.

217
00:17:19,945 --> 00:17:22,195
我也是  我已经试验了所有非典型酶
Me too. I've gone through all of the atypical enzymes.

218
00:17:22,505 --> 00:17:24,105
你从非典型着手的吗
You started with atypicals?

219
00:17:24,645 --> 00:17:26,235
它们的催化率太低
Their catalyzation rate is too low.

220
00:17:26,235 --> 00:17:27,255
我看过一项研究
I read a study that linked the

221
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:29,485
用非典型酶找出了某些病毒抗体
use of atypical enzymes to certain viral antibodies.

222
00:17:29,485 --> 00:17:30,745
你得广泛试验  缩小范围
You have to start wide and narrow down.

223
00:17:30,745 --> 00:17:32,365
所以我才让你用EC-1酶
That's why I assigned you EC-1 enzymes...

224
00:17:32,365 --> 00:17:34,765
这种酶能用任何东西催化  这对我们毫无帮助
EC-1 catalyzes with everything, which tells us nothing,

225
00:17:34,765 --> 00:17:36,785
而且我们没有时间把数千种酶一个个试验
and we don't have time to go through a thousand different enzymes.

226
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:39,015
如果我们要在三小时内做成试验的话
If we're gonna come up with a test in less than 3 hours,

227
00:17:39,015 --> 00:17:39,935
我们得做出创新
we need to do some crea...

228
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:41,025
-莎拉  -干嘛
- Sarah. - What?

229
00:17:41,025 --> 00:17:42,415
你的手怎么了
What's wrong with your hand?

230
00:17:45,255 --> 00:17:46,365
你还好吧
Are you OK?

231
00:17:49,515 --> 00:17:50,755
你感到什么症状了吗
Are you feeling any symptoms?

232
00:17:50,755 --> 00:17:51,875
我整整三天没合眼
I've been up for three days straight.

233
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,835
大概只是太累了
I'm probably just exhausted.

234
00:17:57,595 --> 00:17:58,615
彼得的血清用完了
We're out of Peter's blood serum.

235
00:17:58,615 --> 00:18:00,905
-我去再抽点血样  -我去吧
- I should go get some more samples... - I'll do it.

236
00:18:14,225 --> 00:18:15,845
如果发现病毒确实源于猴子
If you find the virus did come from the monkeys,

237
00:18:15,855 --> 00:18:17,255
这有利于找出解药吗
will that help you figure out a cure?

238
00:18:17,255 --> 00:18:19,465
找出病毒的“解药”只是一个相对的说法
"Curing" a virus is a relative term.

239
00:18:19,475 --> 00:18:22,045
我们得想出治疗方案  让感染者情况好转
We need a treatment to help the infected folks get better,

240
00:18:22,045 --> 00:18:24,745
研制出疫苗预防感染
and a vaccine to prevent anyone else from getting infected.

241
00:18:24,745 --> 00:18:27,845
还有漫漫长路要走  猴子只是第一步
That sick monkey is just the first step down a long road...

242
00:18:30,855 --> 00:18:33,165
见鬼  感染的猴子去哪儿了
Where the hell is my monkey?

243
00:18:37,535 --> 00:18:38,755
这是什么味道
What's that smell?

244
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:40,585
福尔马林
Formaldehyde.

245
00:18:41,555 --> 00:18:44,745
带走猴子的人将这里彻底清扫了个遍
Whoever did this wanted to kill any living organism left behind.

246
00:18:44,755 --> 00:18:47,395
他们不想让我对猴子抽样分析
They didn't want me analyzing the samples from that monkey.

247
00:18:47,395 --> 00:18:48,385
真的很臭
It reeks.

248
00:18:48,385 --> 00:18:51,625
再臭也臭不过x宏那个浑蛋
Reeks all right. Reeks of Hatake.

249
00:18:53,015 --> 00:18:53,855
你要干什么
What are you gonna do?

250
00:18:53,855 --> 00:18:56,415
-去办公室质问他吗  -没错
- Walk into his office and demand answers? - Why not?

251
00:18:56,415 --> 00:18:58,475
你明知他会怎么回答你
Because you know how that conversation's gonna go.

252
00:18:58,475 --> 00:19:00,925
他会说这是生物安全规定
He's gonna say it was biosafety protocol,

253
00:19:00,925 --> 00:19:02,445
或是日常维护程序
or scheduled maintenance.

254
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:06,805
我曾认识一个上校  他就像x博士一样固执己见
I knew this full-bird colonel, just like Hatake. Real stickler.

255
00:19:08,025 --> 00:19:10,845
要解决事情  你得有点创意
You had to find creative ways to get things done.

256
00:19:12,675 --> 00:19:14,045
你有什么好建议
What'd you have in mind?

257
00:19:16,895 --> 00:19:18,915
如果我能找到另一只猴子做样本呢
What if I could get you another monkey sample?

258
00:19:37,555 --> 00:19:39,165
你在这干什么
What are you doing here?

259
00:19:41,045 --> 00:19:44,405
三天前  我们都在适应各自的新生活  现在呢
Three days ago, we were moving on with our lives, and now this?

260
00:19:45,965 --> 00:19:49,525
看着你  往事如潮水般涌来
Seeing you, it all comes flooding back -

261
00:19:49,645 --> 00:19:51,945
我和艾伦之间的不愉快
how unhappy I was with Alan;

262
00:19:52,235 --> 00:19:54,125
我甚至认不出
how I couldn't even recognize...

263
00:19:55,885 --> 00:19:57,665
和他在一起的时候我是谁
who I was with him anymore.

264
00:19:59,035 --> 00:19:59,945
但我不会承认
But instead of acknowledging it,

265
00:19:59,955 --> 00:20:02,075
我什么都不会说  我只是
I didn't say anything; I just...

266
00:20:03,075 --> 00:20:04,765
默默地承受着这所有的一切
swallowed it, all of it,

267
00:20:04,765 --> 00:20:07,345
直到这一切把我淹没  令我窒息
until it filled me up, and I was drowning in it.

268
00:20:10,815 --> 00:20:11,955
然后你又出现了
And then you.

269
00:20:18,015 --> 00:20:19,575
我以为我能承受得住
I thought I could handle this.

270
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:31,145
从来没见过这样的东西
Never seen anything like this.

271
00:20:31,545 --> 00:20:33,045
你看它们的脸
Look at their faces!

272
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,325
没错  太他妈恐怖了
I know. It's pretty damn scary.

273
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:39,455
不  不是恐怖  是恐惧
No, not scary; scared.

274
00:20:39,975 --> 00:20:42,105
这些猴子们为了逃命不顾一切
These monkeys were running for their lives.

275
00:20:42,105 --> 00:20:43,375
它们在逃离什么
Running from what?

276
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:48,775
说真的  你是怎么找到这个地方的
How'd you find this place, anyway?

277
00:20:49,155 --> 00:20:52,735
我在这检查基地周围冰层的稳固性
I was just checking the stability of the icepack around the base.

278
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:55,015
放屁
Horseshit.

279
00:20:55,365 --> 00:20:56,625
你他妈的到底是谁
Who the hell are you?

280
00:20:57,075 --> 00:20:59,365
告诉你了  我是陆军工程师
I'm just an army engineer, like I said.

281
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,915
你要想和我一起干活  行
You want to work together? I got no problem with that.

282
00:21:02,575 --> 00:21:04,855
但你必须要跟我说实话
But you have got to start telling me the truth.

283
00:21:04,855 --> 00:21:06,425
-我说的是实话  -骗谁呢
- I am! - Ha.

284
00:21:08,345 --> 00:21:10,235
陆军部队里有一些人
There are people in the army,

285
00:21:10,475 --> 00:21:12,705
包括我在内
myself included, who are wondering

286
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:14,705
都怀疑疾病的爆发是否真是一场意外
if this outbreak was an accident.

287
00:21:16,205 --> 00:21:18,865
你觉得这是x宏一手策划的吗
You think Hatake did this on purpose?

288
00:21:18,865 --> 00:21:20,175
他为什么要那么做
Why would he do that?

289
00:21:22,075 --> 00:21:23,855
不如你帮我一起找出真相
Why don't you come help me find out?

290
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:48,535
隔离措施建好之前让人24小时看守这里
I want 24-hour guards on this door until we get full containment.

291
00:21:52,435 --> 00:21:53,575
基地一号  请讲
Base One, go ahead.

292
00:21:56,275 --> 00:21:58,315
他们在这一层发现了一名逃跑感染者
They found one of the escapees on this level.

293
00:22:11,185 --> 00:22:12,775
你为什么这么开心
What are you so happy about?

294
00:22:13,095 --> 00:22:15,365
没什么  我刚研究出了测试方法
Nothing. I just cracked the test.

295
00:22:15,365 --> 00:22:18,135
你弄明白了吗  是哪种酶催化
You figured it out? Which enzyme catalyzed?

296
00:22:18,135 --> 00:22:18,945
哪种都不是
None of them.

297
00:22:18,945 --> 00:22:21,195
你离开之后  我想起了另一项研究
After you left, I remembered another study.

298
00:22:21,345 --> 00:22:22,915
那项研究运用了人体本身的机能
It utilizes the body's natural way

299
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,475
来检查入侵的病原体
of detecting foreign pathogens.

300
00:22:24,475 --> 00:22:25,975
白细胞  明白了  快说重点
White blood cells. Yes. Get to the point.

301
00:22:25,975 --> 00:22:28,565
那项研究用维多利亚多管发光水母的基因
So it modified the white blood cells with genes

302
00:22:28,565 --> 00:22:31,165
来改变白细胞的结构
from a crystal jellyfish, Aequorea victoria,

303
00:22:31,165 --> 00:22:33,285
从而形成一个快速反应测试
to create a rapid-response test.

304
00:22:33,295 --> 00:22:35,725
水母基因会产生一种绿色荧光蛋白
The jellyfish genes produce a fluorescent green protein.

305
00:22:35,725 --> 00:22:37,195
你重复试验了吗
You replicated this?

306
00:22:37,205 --> 00:22:39,495
我从三个警卫人员身上取了对照样本  测试都没变色
I swabbed three security techs for control samples - all clear.

307
00:22:39,495 --> 00:22:40,825
然后我在已知感染者身上重做了那个测试
Then I ran the test on known infectees

308
00:22:40,825 --> 00:22:44,225
彼得  特蕾西博士和德克勒克博士
Peter, Dr. Tracey, and Dr. DeKlerk.

309
00:22:44,245 --> 00:22:46,245
结果全部呈现绿色  证明受到了感染
All green - positive for infection.

310
00:22:46,695 --> 00:22:49,315
再做一次给我看  以你自己为对照样本
Show me again. Use yourself as a control.

311
00:22:50,715 --> 00:22:51,945
为什么要这样做
Why does that matter?

312
00:22:55,365 --> 00:22:56,755
听着  如果你想看看这个测试的效果
Look, if you want to see it in action,

313
00:22:56,755 --> 00:22:58,585
我可以直接在你身上试验
I can take a swab from you right now.

314
00:23:03,885 --> 00:23:06,025
行  拿我来测
OK. Test me.

315
00:23:07,765 --> 00:23:09,425
我不明白为什么要在这浪费时间
I don't know why we're wasting our time with this.

316
00:23:09,425 --> 00:23:10,675
我们得尽快告诉艾伦
We need to tell Alan.

317
00:23:47,205 --> 00:23:49,645
开门  杜尚  我知道你在里面
Come on, Duchamp! I know you're in there!

318
00:23:50,775 --> 00:23:53,125
-别靠近我  -把它放下  把它放下
- Don't come any closer. - Put it down. Put it down.

319
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:53,825
让我们来帮助你
We're going to help you.

320
00:23:53,825 --> 00:23:55,795
就像帮助苏勒玛尼博士那样帮我吗
Oh, just like you took care of Dr. Sulemani, huh?

321
00:23:55,795 --> 00:23:56,785
发生在苏勒玛尼博士身上的
What happened to Dr. Sulema--

322
00:23:56,785 --> 00:23:58,845
-你要把我们都杀了  -是个错误
- You want us all to die! - ...was a terrible mistake,

323
00:23:58,845 --> 00:24:00,705
我们不想伤害到你
all right? We don't want to hurt you,

324
00:24:00,745 --> 00:24:04,355
-但是你必须去隔离  -我坚决不去
- but you have to come to isolation. - I'm not going there!

325
00:24:04,615 --> 00:24:06,485
我没有被感染
I'm not even infected!

326
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:12,565
至少在你把我和他们关在一起之前没有
Or at least I wasn't until you threw me in with the rest of them!

327
00:24:12,565 --> 00:24:15,025
-让我帮助你吧  -给我解药
- Let me help you. - I want the cure!

328
00:24:15,025 --> 00:24:17,615
-我们没有解药啊  -放屁
- We don't have a cure. - Bullshit!

329
00:24:17,615 --> 00:24:19,025
索迪拉就在这里面
The SODRA's in there.

330
00:24:19,025 --> 00:24:21,715
你不让我们拿到它  我不会让你这么做的
You're keeping it from us, and I'm not gonna let you!

331
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,865
把他和苏勒玛尼一起关到聚变实验室
Put him in the fusion lab with Sulemani.

332
00:24:34,615 --> 00:24:36,855
我是疾控中心的艾伦・法拉格特
This is Alan Farragut of the CDC.

333
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:39,075
里面的人都还好吗
Everybody all right in there?

334
00:24:40,195 --> 00:24:41,725
谢天谢地你来了  他们差点就闯进来了
Thank God you're here. They almost got in.

335
00:24:41,725 --> 00:24:44,165
-你叫什么名字  -菲力浦・杜尚
- What's your name? - Philippe Duchamp.

336
00:24:45,505 --> 00:24:47,535
为什么他说你有解药
What was he saying about you having a cure?

337
00:24:48,215 --> 00:24:51,135
他在胡说  根本没有解药
This is ridiculous. There is no cure.

338
00:25:22,465 --> 00:25:26,255
加入增长因子  细胞就能增长到足够的数量
Adding growth factor so the cells will build a critical mass

339
00:25:26,265 --> 00:25:28,115
用来进行基因组测序
for the genome sequencing.

340
00:25:29,175 --> 00:25:30,805
然后把它放到培养器中
And we stick it in the incubator

341
00:25:30,805 --> 00:25:32,435
剩下的就是等待了
and wait.

342
00:25:32,435 --> 00:25:35,025
就是继续做我这一小时在做的事就对了
So, do the same thing I've been doing for the last hour.

343
00:25:38,545 --> 00:25:39,895
这正常吗
Is that supposed to happen?

344
00:25:59,375 --> 00:26:01,365
这就是你说的培养病毒吗
So, when you said you're growning the virus?

345
00:26:01,365 --> 00:26:02,895
不应该长成那样的
It wasn't supposed to grow like that.

346
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,125
你是指像活的一样吗
You mean like it was alive?

347
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:06,215
病毒不是活着的有机体
Viruses aren't living organisms.

348
00:26:06,215 --> 00:26:08,845
它们不存在能量和碳代谢
They lack any form of energy or carbon metabolism.

349
00:26:08,855 --> 00:26:10,345
那它为什么会突然急速增长
Why did it hulk out?

350
00:26:10,345 --> 00:26:12,085
那就是我们要寻找的答案
That's what we're gonna find out.

351
00:26:12,165 --> 00:26:14,325
也许艾伦会知道为什么它对增长因子
Maybe Alan'll know why it reacted so violently

352
00:26:14,335 --> 00:26:16,085
-反应如此剧烈  -等等
- to the growth factor. - Wait.

353
00:26:17,215 --> 00:26:19,835
-不要  -不要干什么
- Don't. - Don't what?

354
00:26:20,065 --> 00:26:23,515
不要告诉任何人  如果x宏知道了
Don't tell anyone. If Hatake gets wind of this,

355
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:25,515
就会像清理猴子室那样把这里清的一干二净
it'll be the monkey room all over again.

356
00:26:28,805 --> 00:26:32,935
我还是不信任你  不过你说得对
I still don't trust you, but when you're right, you're right.

357
00:26:40,815 --> 00:26:44,135
布赖斯博士说杜尚在研发一种解药
Dr. Bryce said Duchamp was working on a... a cure,

358
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:46,845
-叫索迪拉  -抱歉 无可奉告
- Something called SODRA. - I can't discuss that.

359
00:26:47,285 --> 00:26:48,885
这是机密研究
The research is proprietary.

360
00:26:48,885 --> 00:26:51,535
不  别再藏着掖着了
No! No more secrets!

361
00:26:51,555 --> 00:26:53,945
你答应我不再隐瞒任何事情的
You promised me transparency.

362
00:26:54,975 --> 00:26:57,205
当接到卫星信号时
When the satellite comes online,

363
00:26:57,685 --> 00:26:59,815
我会和我的董事会谈谈
I'll speak with my board of directors.

364
00:26:59,815 --> 00:27:02,685
你必须把该让我知道的事都告诉我
You will tell me everything I need to know,

365
00:27:02,775 --> 00:27:04,785
否则  当接收到卫星信号时
or when that satellite comes online,

366
00:27:04,905 --> 00:27:07,555
我会告诉所有主流新闻机构
I'll tell every major news organization on earth

367
00:27:07,555 --> 00:27:09,205
这个基地到底发生了什么
what's happening in this base.

368
00:27:09,275 --> 00:27:11,585
你觉得美国军队可怕吗
You think you're afraid of the US military?

369
00:27:11,615 --> 00:27:14,455
当你想在《纽约邮报》面前保守秘密时再说吧
Wait till you have to keep your secrets from the New York Post.

370
00:27:17,305 --> 00:27:20,155
索迪拉是一种有惊人治愈率的
SODRA is an antiviral treatment

371
00:27:20,155 --> 00:27:22,635
抗病毒治疗剂
with an astonishing cure rate -

372
00:27:23,505 --> 00:27:25,825
治愈率几乎100%
nearly 100%.

373
00:27:27,725 --> 00:27:28,895
你说的治疗
When you say cure,

374
00:27:29,745 --> 00:27:32,105
是说它能将病毒完全铲除
you mean total viral elimination?

375
00:27:32,355 --> 00:27:35,195
-而对宿主细胞没有任何伤害吗  -是的
- With no harm to host cells? - Yes.

376
00:27:37,325 --> 00:27:39,735
你测试过多少种病毒了
How many viruses have you tested against?

377
00:27:39,855 --> 00:27:41,055
范围有多广
How wide a range?

378
00:27:41,695 --> 00:27:42,705
所有病毒种类
All of them.

379
00:27:42,705 --> 00:27:46,285
甲流  肝炎  艾滋病吗
H1N1? Hepatitis? HIV?

380
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:48,965
该死的  天花也是一种病毒
Hell, smallpox is a virus.

381
00:27:50,455 --> 00:27:54,045
全世界只有两个地方有天花样本
There are only two places on earth that have smallpox:

382
00:27:54,045 --> 00:27:56,715
疾控中心和俄罗斯载体研究院
the CDC, and Vector Institute in Russia.

383
00:27:56,715 --> 00:27:59,505
实际上  是三个地方有
Actually, there are three.

384
00:28:03,345 --> 00:28:05,865
你为了研发一种万能解药
You have been growing lethal viruses

385
00:28:06,335 --> 00:28:08,705
一直在培育致命病毒吗
for the purpose of developing a cure-all.

386
00:28:08,705 --> 00:28:10,165
索迪拉的确有效
SODRA works.

387
00:28:11,175 --> 00:28:14,955
在所有的动物试验中  病毒都被杀死了
In all animal test cases, the viruses were killed.

388
00:28:15,685 --> 00:28:18,865
唯一的问题就是死亡率
The only problem is the mortality rate.

389
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:24,165
共有多少试验样本死亡
How many subjects were killed?

390
00:28:24,595 --> 00:28:26,545
超过百分之七十五
Over 75%.

391
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:31,855
所以索迪拉不能投入使用
Which is why SODRA is not an option.

392
00:28:37,895 --> 00:28:39,475
R层的隔离措施已经建造完毕
Level R has been sealed.

393
00:28:39,475 --> 00:28:42,065
我们把他们带下去  逐个排查
We'll take everyone downstairs, go person to person.

394
00:28:42,065 --> 00:28:45,675
感染者留在下面  其他人回来
Anyone who's infected stays below; everyone else comes back up.

395
00:28:47,495 --> 00:28:49,755
已经准备好进行一百四十个测试的器材了
A hundred and forty tests ready to go.

396
00:28:51,165 --> 00:28:52,655
你们俩干得不错
You two did good work.

397
00:29:16,395 --> 00:29:17,895
被叫到名字的人
If I call your name,

10398
00:29:17,295 --> 00:29:17,845
受感染测试样本
生物危险品

399
00:29:18,395 --> 00:29:20,935
请上前来  从乔丹博士那
please step over here, take a face shield

400
00:29:20,935 --> 00:29:23,575
拿一个面罩  然后站到这边
from Dr. Jordan, and then come stand over here.

401
00:29:25,035 --> 00:29:27,765
阿尔瓦雷斯博士
Doctors... Alvarez...

402
00:29:29,365 --> 00:29:30,835
米哈洛维奇博士
Mihalovich...

403
00:29:33,255 --> 00:29:34,465
哈桑博士
Hassan.

404
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:37,445
安保人员特里
Security Tech Terry.

405
00:29:37,855 --> 00:29:39,295
李孙博士
Dr. Sun-Lee.

406
00:29:41,365 --> 00:29:43,045
安保人员格鲁宁
Security Tech Gruning.

407
00:29:45,015 --> 00:29:47,345
被我叫到的人
Those of you whose names I have called,

408
00:29:47,345 --> 00:29:48,095
请跟我走
you'll follow me.

409
00:29:48,095 --> 00:29:51,325
其他人跟乔丹博士和沃克博士留在这里
The rest of you will stay with Dr. Jordan and Dr. Walker.

410
00:29:51,335 --> 00:29:55,525
等等  为什么他们能回到楼上
Wait! Why are they getting to go back upstairs?

411
00:30:00,525 --> 00:30:03,005
因为测试结果显示他们没感染病毒
Because they tested negative for the virus.

412
00:30:05,655 --> 00:30:08,795
大家请随意选择空余床位安顿下来
Please find any empty cot. Make yourselves at home.

413
00:30:08,795 --> 00:30:11,185
沃克博士和乔丹博士
Dr. Walker and Dr. Jordan will be

414
00:30:11,185 --> 00:30:13,615
会向你们收集医疗信息
coming around to collect your medical information.

415
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:15,045
大家去吧
Go ahead.

416
00:30:18,265 --> 00:30:20,195
-这是最后一组  -有多少人
- That's the last group. - How many?

417
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:21,375
四十三个感染者
Forty-three infected.

418
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:23,495
这几乎是基地人数的三分之一了
That's almost a third of the base.

419
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:27,385
我想把布赖斯博士和苏勒玛尼博士也带下来
I want to bring Drs. Bryce and Sulemani down here.

420
00:30:27,395 --> 00:30:29,505
难道不该把他们继续锁在聚变实验室吗
Shouldn't they stay locked up in the fusion lab?

421
00:30:29,505 --> 00:30:31,275
他们已经试图逃脱一次了
They already tried to escape once.

422
00:30:32,855 --> 00:30:34,885
这层很牢固  他们逃不掉的
This floor is secure. There's no way out.

423
00:30:35,095 --> 00:30:36,025
失陪了
Excuse me.

424
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:48,375
把这层隔离起来是个好主意
Isolating this level was a good idea.

425
00:30:49,665 --> 00:30:50,775
人们慢慢适应了这里
People are settling in.

426
00:30:50,775 --> 00:30:52,245
是啊  但是他们都很恐慌
Yeah, but they're scared.

427
00:30:53,305 --> 00:30:55,095
我觉得很多人都相信他们没病
I think a lot of them believed they weren't sick.

428
00:30:55,105 --> 00:30:58,395
其实有些人是知道的  他们只是不愿相信
Part of them knew. They just didn't want to believe it.

429
00:31:07,055 --> 00:31:09,845
我又检查了彼得的生命体征  他快不行了
I took Peter's vitals again. He's all over the place...

430
00:31:11,285 --> 00:31:12,335
只要一有卫星信号
I'm sending his lab work to

431
00:31:12,335 --> 00:31:15,045
我会马上把他的实验内容传给疾控中心
the CDC as soon as the satellite window opens.

432
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:16,785
让更多人一起参与
Get some more heads in the game

433
00:31:17,635 --> 00:31:19,665
加速找到安全的疗法和疫苗
when finding a safe treatment and a vaccine.

434
00:31:19,665 --> 00:31:21,485
对他来说  那可能已经晚了
That may be too late for him.

435
00:31:28,905 --> 00:31:29,955
开门
Open the door.

436
00:31:30,085 --> 00:31:32,515
把他们转移到隔离区
Let's get these people into the isolation beds.

437
00:32:28,885 --> 00:32:30,465
样本整理好了吗
Almost done with the samples?

438
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:32,705
我正要拿到楼上去
I was just about to bring them upstairs.

439
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:36,315
怎么了
What's wrong?

440
00:32:36,325 --> 00:32:38,905
没事  只是不小心滑了一下
No, I'm fine. I just slipped.

441
00:32:41,605 --> 00:32:44,915
-莎拉  你被感染了吗  -什么
- Are you infected, Sarah? - What?

442
00:32:45,675 --> 00:32:48,035
你曾在药品库遇上彼得  他袭击你了吗
You were in the drug stockroom with Peter. Did he attack you?

443
00:32:48,035 --> 00:32:50,465
没有  我说过了  他跑了
No. I told you. He ran off.

444
00:32:50,475 --> 00:32:52,035
没错  但那只是你的一面之词
That's right, you told us.

445
00:32:54,735 --> 00:32:58,435
-你认为我会在这种事上撒谎吗  -你的症状
- You think I would lie about something like that? - Your symptoms.

446
00:32:58,435 --> 00:32:59,755
今天早上你还想掩藏手抖的事实
You tried to hide your hand tremor this morning,

447
00:32:59,755 --> 00:33:00,955
而且你不肯把自己
and you wouldn't use yourself

448
00:33:00,955 --> 00:33:02,665
作为快速反应测试的对照样本
as a control sample for the rapid-response test...

449
00:33:02,665 --> 00:33:04,185
你要我做这个测试吗
You want me to take the test?

450
00:33:05,495 --> 00:33:07,335
-行  -我不是在指责你
- Fine. - I'm not judging.

451
00:33:07,335 --> 00:33:08,625
我能理解...
I can understand...

452
00:33:08,625 --> 00:33:11,505
如果我真的被感染了  我绝不会隐瞒
I would never risk spreading an infectious disease.

453
00:33:11,965 --> 00:33:13,785
那样太没有职业道德了
That's completely unethical.

454
00:33:14,055 --> 00:33:15,955
你帮我当成什么样的医生了
What kind of a doctor do you think I am?

455
00:33:31,155 --> 00:33:32,135
我没被感染
It's clear.

456
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:35,275
满意了
Happy?

457
00:33:35,525 --> 00:33:38,425
-我很抱歉  我只是...  -艾伦在哪
- I'm sorry. I just thought... - Where's Alan?

458
00:33:39,195 --> 00:33:40,925
在巡查分诊室  有事吗
Checking the triage room. Why?

459
00:33:40,925 --> 00:33:42,015
我们有麻烦了
We have a problem.

460
00:33:42,785 --> 00:33:44,645
苏勒玛尼博士逃离了聚变实验室
Dr. Sulemani broke out of the fusion lab.

461
00:33:44,645 --> 00:33:47,105
-她还杀死了布赖斯博士  -什么
- She killed Dr. Bryce. - What?

462
00:33:47,465 --> 00:33:49,355
苏勒玛尼博士也在这一层吗
Dr. Sulemani is on this level?

463
00:33:49,685 --> 00:33:51,175
她正在大开杀戒
She's killing people!

464
00:33:56,735 --> 00:33:58,715
停下来  保持冷静
Stop! Remain calm!

465
00:33:59,725 --> 00:34:00,535
停下来
Stop!

466
00:34:03,265 --> 00:34:04,845
请大家保持冷静
Please, stay calm!

467
00:34:04,845 --> 00:34:05,815
保持冷静
Calm down!

468
00:34:05,905 --> 00:34:06,525
保持冷静
Calm down!

469
00:34:06,525 --> 00:34:08,615
-别紧张  先退后  -退后
- Relax, get back! - Back!

470
00:34:09,325 --> 00:34:11,455
大家都保持冷静
Everyone remain calm!

471
00:34:11,455 --> 00:34:12,975
-莎拉  -艾伦
- Sarah! - Alan!

472
00:34:12,975 --> 00:34:15,065
发生了什么事  茱莉亚在哪
What's going on? Where's Julia?

473
00:34:16,405 --> 00:34:17,255
退后
Get back!

474
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:22,165
茱莉亚
Julia!

475
00:34:26,745 --> 00:34:28,765
退后  赶紧退后
Get back! Back, now!

476
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:35,185
离开走道  快离开走道
Out of the hallway! Get out of the hallway!

477
00:34:35,185 --> 00:34:37,585
快离开走道
Get out of the hallway!

478
00:36:24,295 --> 00:36:26,145
-我们得赶紧坐电梯回到楼上  -我不行
- We need to get in the elevator. Get upstairs... - I can't.

479
00:36:26,155 --> 00:36:28,045
我们重新休整  治好伤者...
We'll regroup, get medical supplies for the injured...

480
00:36:28,045 --> 00:36:29,895
-我得留在下面  -这里太危险了
- I have to stay down here. - It's too dangerous.

481
00:36:29,895 --> 00:36:32,115
-我们得尽快离开  -艾伦  我不行
- We have to go. - Alan, I can't.

482
00:36:48,185 --> 00:36:49,375
发生什么了
What happened?

483
00:36:52,045 --> 00:36:53,525
沃克博士在哪里
Where is Dr. Walker?

484
00:36:55,265 --> 00:36:56,665
她留在了楼下
She's staying down there.

485
00:36:58,265 --> 00:36:59,905
你怎么能放心把她留在那里
How could you risk leaving her?

486
00:37:00,275 --> 00:37:01,495
法拉格特博士
Dr. Farragut.

487
00:37:01,825 --> 00:37:02,775
艾伦
Alan!

488
00:37:06,705 --> 00:37:08,895
她被传染了  她感染了病毒
She's infected. She has the virus.

489
00:37:11,485 --> 00:37:13,425
我们得封锁R层
We need to seal off Level R.

490
00:37:13,425 --> 00:37:15,465
这是唯一能阻止继续传染的方式
It's the only way to stop the contagion.

491
00:37:15,745 --> 00:37:19,515
就这么丢下他们吗  没有任何的水和食物
Leave them down there? With no food or water?

492
00:37:19,515 --> 00:37:21,085
那里面有足够一星期的供给
There's a week's worth of supplies.

493
00:37:21,085 --> 00:37:21,965
他说得对
He's right.

494
00:37:22,965 --> 00:37:23,835
我们...
We've...

495
00:37:25,855 --> 00:37:28,725
我已经失去了对局面的控制
I have lost control of this situation.

496
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:31,275
我们必须将那一层完全封锁
We need to seal it off.

497
00:37:31,845 --> 00:37:35,535
沃克博士还在那里  你怎么能说出这种话
How can you say that with Dr. Walker still down there?

498
00:37:35,535 --> 00:37:37,235
这只是支援来前的暂时之计
It's only until help arrives.

499
00:37:39,565 --> 00:37:42,645
一旦卫星通讯可以使用
When the satellite com link goes operative again,

500
00:37:42,645 --> 00:37:44,585
我就会呼叫军队寻求支援
I'm calling in the army for backup.

501
00:38:58,815 --> 00:39:00,465
两百七十四人
Two hundred and seventy-four.

502
00:39:03,645 --> 00:39:06,485
三名基奎特护士  死于埃博拉病毒
Three nurses in Kikwit of Ebola;

503
00:39:07,675 --> 00:39:10,665
苏丹的六口之家  死于拉沙热
family of six in Sudan, Lassa fever;

504
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:16,965
十名住在海德堡大学宿舍的学生  死于军团病
10 students in a Heidelberg dorm, Legionnaires' disease;

505
00:39:16,965 --> 00:39:19,755
我们都有过病人在我们眼前死去  艾伦
We've all had people die on our watch, Alan.

506
00:39:20,015 --> 00:39:23,135
工作中难以避免  我们只能尽力而为
It's part of the job. We save who we can.

507
00:39:24,845 --> 00:39:26,635
至今为止  这两百七十四人
I could live with 274

508
00:39:26,635 --> 00:39:28,975
都是死于疾病  而不是因为我
because it was the disease that killed them,

509
00:39:28,975 --> 00:39:30,965
所以我问心无愧
not me, until now.

510
00:39:33,935 --> 00:39:38,185
可今天  我不但亲手杀死了一个人
I not only killed someone with my own hands today...

511
00:39:39,785 --> 00:39:43,345
而且很有可能...  茱莉亚
but it's very likely... Julia

512
00:39:43,345 --> 00:39:46,315
-很有可能...  -在我看来  你别无选择
- is very likely... - Way I hear it, you didn't have much choice.

513
00:39:48,745 --> 00:39:52,305
我们如今面对的  是前所未有的挑战
What we're dealing with here... none of us has ever seen.

514
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:58,075
你是疾控中心最优秀的人才  你能创造奇迹
You're still the best CDC has. I've seen you pull off miracles.

515
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:02,285
你会想出办法救他们两个的
You'll figure out a way to save 'em both.

516
00:40:09,085 --> 00:40:10,345
你的猴子研究得怎么样了
What happened with the monkey?

517
00:40:11,765 --> 00:40:13,505
现在还得不出准确的结论
It's inconclusive for now.

518
00:40:16,635 --> 00:40:17,625
这真不幸
That's too bad.

519
00:40:17,635 --> 00:40:20,445
我...我还在做一些测试
I'm, uh... I'm still doing tests.

520
00:41:25,495 --> 00:41:27,825
不  不
No. No.

10521
00:41:31,945 --> 00:41:32,505
受感染测试样本
生物危险品

522
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:35,115
不  它们该是绿色的
No, they should be green,

523
00:41:35,115 --> 00:41:37,825
它们都该是绿色的  这不管用
they should all be green! It doesn't work.

524
00:41:38,615 --> 00:41:39,665
这不管用
It doesn't work!

525
00:41:56,535 --> 00:41:59,435
-观察室  -朵琳  亚伦在吗
- Observation. - Doreen, where's Alan?

526
00:42:03,785 --> 00:42:04,685
茱尔斯
Jules?

527
00:42:08,915 --> 00:42:09,765
听得到吗
Hello?

528
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:12,935
亚伦
Alan?

529
00:42:13,925 --> 00:42:16,865
茱尔斯  你在吗  茱尔斯
Jules? You there? Jules?

530
00:42:19,685 --> 00:42:21,075
有人在吗
Hello?!

531
00:42:22,995 --> 00:42:24,855
能听到我说话吗
Can anybody hear me?!

532
00:42:27,265 --> 00:42:29,405
那测试不管用
The test doesn't work!

533
00:42:29,975 --> 00:42:31,735
那不管用
It doesn't work!

1
00:00:01,233 --> 00:00:02,503
《双螺旋》前情提要
Previously on Helix...

2
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:05,133
那是他前妻吗  他从未说起过她或者他弟弟
That's his ex-wife? He never talks about her or his brother.

3
00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:06,303
他没说的原因很可能是因为
That's probably because

4
00:00:06,303 --> 00:00:08,343
他曾将前妻和弟弟捉奸在床
he caught her and his brother in bed together.

5
00:00:09,163 --> 00:00:10,393
我刚研究出了测试方法
I just cracked the test.

6
00:00:10,393 --> 00:00:12,873
我从三名安保人员身上取了对照样本
I swabbed three security techs for control samples -

7
00:00:12,873 --> 00:00:13,473
结果都没变色
all clear -

8
00:00:13,473 --> 00:00:15,163
然后我在已知感染者身上重做了那个测试
then I ran the test on known infectees.

9
00:00:15,163 --> 00:00:16,793
结果全部呈现绿色  证明受到了感染
All green, positive for infection.

10
00:00:16,793 --> 00:00:20,003
杜尚在研发一种解药  叫索迪拉
Duchamp was working on a cure, something called SODRA.

11
00:00:20,003 --> 00:00:23,003
-共有多少试验样本死亡  -超过百分之七十五
- How many subjects were killed? - Over 75%.

12
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:28,363
我得留在下面
I have to stay down here.

13
00:00:28,363 --> 00:00:29,983
这里太危险了  我们得尽快离开
It's too dangerous. We have to go.

14
00:00:29,983 --> 00:00:31,283
艾伦  我不行
Alan, I can't.

15
00:00:32,343 --> 00:00:34,413
她被传染了  她感染了病毒
She's infected. She has the virus.

16
00:00:34,413 --> 00:00:36,348
我们得封锁R层
We need to seal off Level R.

17
00:00:36,349 --> 00:00:38,390
这是唯一能阻止继续传染的方式
It's the only way to stop the contagion.

18
00:00:38,577 --> 00:00:39,933
就这么丢下他们吗
Leave them down there?

19
00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:42,293
他说得对  我们必须将那一层完全封锁
He's right. We need to seal it off.

20
00:00:42,573 --> 00:00:45,023
测试不管用  这不管用
The test doesn't work. It doesn't work!

21
00:00:49,873 --> 00:00:50,883
亚伦
Alan.

22
00:00:51,753 --> 00:00:54,653
茱尔斯  你在吗  茱尔斯
Jules? You there? Jules?

10023
00:00:56,273 --> 00:01:01,613
{\an8}第四天

24
00:01:05,673 --> 00:01:07,723
他们关闭了跟我们的通讯
They shut off communications with us.

25
00:01:07,723 --> 00:01:09,823
他们要饿死我们
They want to starve us out of here.

26
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:13,163
x宏和疾控中心的人已经放弃了我们
Hatake and the CDC have abandoned us.

27
00:01:13,793 --> 00:01:15,983
没有治疗  没有解药
There is no treatment, no cure.

28
00:01:16,353 --> 00:01:19,103
我们只得靠自己解决这事了
We are forced to take matters into our own hands.

29
00:01:19,593 --> 00:01:21,333
疾控中心的人没有放弃我们
The CDC hasn't abandoned us.

30
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,303
等他们搞清楚这是怎么回事  该如何帮我们
They'll be back as soon as they figure out what's going on

31
00:01:23,313 --> 00:01:24,283
就会回来的
and how to help us.

32
00:01:24,383 --> 00:01:25,703
他们不会回来了
They are not coming back.

33
00:01:26,183 --> 00:01:27,983
他们任我们在这儿自生自灭
They left us down here to die.

34
00:01:28,773 --> 00:01:31,363
但我们绝不会坐以待毙
Only we will not go down without a fight.

35
00:01:31,663 --> 00:01:35,933
这层有个二氧化碳排放系统的控制节点
On this level, there is a control node for the CO2 removal system.

36
00:01:36,433 --> 00:01:37,753
我们可以手动操控
We can override it.

37
00:01:37,753 --> 00:01:39,643
他们不能直接从外界过滤空气进来吗
Can't they just filter in air from outside?

38
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:41,563
外面现在零下60多度
It's 60 below out there,

39
00:01:41,713 --> 00:01:44,103
主入口以内的区域都已经封锁
and everything past the main entrance is sealed up

40
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:46,673
像宇宙飞船一样  以防止传染
like a spaceship to prevent contamination.

41
00:01:47,053 --> 00:01:50,763
如果我们把空气净化器关了
But if we shut off the oxygen scrubbers,

42
00:01:51,113 --> 00:01:54,893
楼上的空气不超过六小时就会用尽
they run out of air upstairs in six hours max.

43
00:01:54,893 --> 00:01:58,633
-我们也是  -R层比上面大
- So do we. - Level R is much larger.

44
00:01:58,643 --> 00:02:00,933
我们人数更少  空气储量更多
Fewer people, bigger air pocket.

45
00:02:01,193 --> 00:02:03,263
足够撑得比他们久  如果他们想
Enough to outlast them if they want to -

46
00:02:03,573 --> 00:02:05,763
这话怎么说  比胆量的话
how do you say it? - play chicken.

47
00:02:05,763 --> 00:02:07,313
这主意太糟了
This is a terrible idea.

48
00:02:07,473 --> 00:02:09,773
我们得集中精力重建通讯
We need to focus on re-establishing communication.

49
00:02:09,773 --> 00:02:11,673
这就是通讯
This is communication.

50
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,333
这个基地里满是危险物品
The base is full of hazardous materials

51
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,223
还有个更危险的传染病
and an even more hazardous infection.

52
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:16,743
你会危及每一个人...
You're endangering every single person--

53
00:02:16,743 --> 00:02:20,203
谢谢你的意见  沃克博士
Thank you for your input, Dr. Walker,

54
00:02:20,523 --> 00:02:23,813
但你是时候找个新地方待了
but it's time, I think, you found a new place to bunk.

55
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:26,213
你知道这是意外还是人为的吗
Do you even know if this was an accident, or was it intentional?

10056
00:03:24,998 --> 00:03:27,255
{\an8}保持冷静  继续前进

57
00:03:26,223 --> 00:03:28,573
我们说话这会儿  我的手下已经在调查了
I have my people investigating as we speak.

58
00:03:29,463 --> 00:03:31,653
真是好极了  无法跟外界联系
Well, that's just great. And how do we control

59
00:03:31,653 --> 00:03:33,373
我们要如何控制这场
this outbreak without communication

60
00:03:33,373 --> 00:03:35,663
-疾病的爆发  -这里有着
- with the outside world? - You have access

61
00:03:35,663 --> 00:03:38,713
世上最顶尖的头脑和设备
to the top minds and equipment in the world here.

62
00:03:38,713 --> 00:03:41,533
这么说你是不打算修理卫星天线了
That sounds like you don't plan to repair the satellite dish.

63
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:44,123
顶级的军事承包商
It took a top-tier military contractor

64
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:46,723
搭脚手架弄了两个月才完成安装
two months in scaffolds to put up that equipment.

65
00:03:46,723 --> 00:03:47,893
不是说修就能修的
It doesn't just get fixed.

66
00:03:47,893 --> 00:03:50,353
那要多久才会有人发现我们这里出问题了
So how long before somebody notices we've gone dark?

67
00:03:50,353 --> 00:03:52,473
我们定期会有物资补给
We have periodic resupply drops.

68
00:03:52,873 --> 00:03:55,253
难道这里只有我觉得事态严重吗
Am I the only one here alarmed by this?

69
00:03:55,253 --> 00:03:58,153
R层里关着那么多人  包括我的队员之一
We have people down on Level R, including one of my own,

70
00:03:58,153 --> 00:04:00,413
他们却只有一周的供给
locked up with a week's worth of supplies.

71
00:04:00,413 --> 00:04:02,873
是你要封锁那一层的
You're the one who wanted to seal that floor.

72
00:04:02,873 --> 00:04:06,343
暂时性的  当时我以为可以向外界请求增援
Temporarily! When I thought we could call for reinforcements.

73
00:04:06,343 --> 00:04:08,243
如果是长期情况
If this is a long-term situation,

74
00:04:08,243 --> 00:04:11,333
我们就得照顾那些人
we have to provide those people with some standard of care!

75
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,733
我手头的人阻止一个带菌者
I barely had the manpower to stop

76
00:04:13,743 --> 00:04:16,913
传染给半个基地的人就已经够呛了
one of those vectors from infecting half the base.

77
00:04:17,213 --> 00:04:19,123
我们不能冒险开启那一层
We can't risk re-opening that floor.

78
00:04:19,123 --> 00:04:22,723
我们现在面对的情况根本前所未见
We are dealing with something we've never seen before.

79
00:04:26,963 --> 00:04:30,523
所以我们就这么放弃那些患病和快死的人吗
So, we just abandon the sick and the dying?

80
00:04:32,453 --> 00:04:33,463
是的
Yes.

10081
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:48,753
《双螺旋》第一季第四集

82
00:05:00,903 --> 00:05:01,873
该死
Shit!

83
00:05:13,783 --> 00:05:14,833
乔丹博士
Dr. Jordan.

84
00:05:15,383 --> 00:05:16,333
怎么了
Yes.

85
00:05:16,373 --> 00:05:18,373
范・艾根医生
Um, Dr. Van Eigem.

86
00:05:18,373 --> 00:05:20,593
你昨天给我做过测试的  我能进去吗
You tested me yesterday. Can I come in?

87
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:26,193
当然  有什么事吗
Um, sure. How can I help you?

88
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:28,013
我不想去R层
I don't want to go to Level R.

89
00:05:29,073 --> 00:05:31,003
不会的  你测试结果呈阴性
You won't. You tested negative.

90
00:05:31,003 --> 00:05:34,123
测试结果一定准确吗  不会出差错吗
And you haven't gotten any false results? Any variances?

91
00:05:34,123 --> 00:05:36,373
-不会的  测试是我亲自设计的  -你确定吗
- No. I designed the test myself. - Are you sure?

92
00:05:37,043 --> 00:05:38,963
-当然了  -可是...
- Yes, of course. - I mean...

93
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:42,203
这样你还确定吗
are you really sure?

94
00:05:48,513 --> 00:05:51,973
x宏坚持不让步  他想把感染的人
Hatake's not budging. He intends to leave the infected

95
00:05:51,973 --> 00:05:54,073
留在下面  让他们自生自灭
downstairs with whatever food and supplies they can

96
00:05:54,073 --> 00:05:57,163
-直到找到治疗方法为止  -可怜的茱莉亚
- scrounge until there's a treatment. - Poor Julia.

97
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,503
为什么我们不请求增援了
What happened to calling in reinforcements?

98
00:06:00,103 --> 00:06:01,083
通讯系统瘫痪
With the com-link down,

99
00:06:01,093 --> 00:06:02,633
我们跟外界失去了所有联系
we're blacked out and dead to the world.

100
00:06:02,633 --> 00:06:05,813
他提到过什么定期补给
He did mention something about periodic resupply drops.

101
00:06:05,813 --> 00:06:08,163
他说过定期是多久吗
He say how periodic they are?

102
00:06:08,163 --> 00:06:10,083
没有  那家伙现在藏着掖着什么都不跟我们说
No, The man's playing his own game and he isn't sharing

103
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,583
你知道的  我们只能靠自己了
the playbook. You know that. We're on our own.

104
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:15,913
目前我们唯一的成果就是快速反应测试
All we have going for us is our rapid response test to the virus.

105
00:06:16,903 --> 00:06:17,913
不好意思
Sorry.

106
00:06:18,073 --> 00:06:20,033
我刚才忙聚合酶链式反应测试了
I had to babysit a PCR assay.

107
00:06:20,033 --> 00:06:21,763
这借口真不错
And the dog ate my homework.

108
00:06:21,763 --> 00:06:23,343
我知道大家现在都很有压力
Hey. We're all feeling the pressure, all right?

109
00:06:23,343 --> 00:06:25,183
但是我们得集中注意力
But we need to stay on point here.

110
00:06:25,453 --> 00:06:26,313
如果我们不采取行动
There are a lot of people in

111
00:06:26,313 --> 00:06:28,463
会有很多人痛苦不堪备受煎熬
for a lot of suffering if we don't step it up.

112
00:06:28,463 --> 00:06:30,283
朵琳  病毒传染源你查得怎么样了
Doreen, what's your progress on the source?

113
00:06:30,283 --> 00:06:33,023
极有可能是动物传播
Strong possibility of zoonotic transfer.

114
00:06:33,823 --> 00:06:37,163
唯一的问题是  是猴子传给了人
Only question is: was it a monkey to human,

115
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:39,823
-还是人传给的猴子  -我需要更详细的结果
- or the other way around? - I need more than that.

116
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,083
-莎拉你呢  -我正在继续沃克
- Sarah? - I'm picking up Walker's

117
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,243
对纳尔维克A和B样本的分析
analysis of the NARVIK-A and B samples.

118
00:06:45,243 --> 00:06:47,103
DNA测序仪在一天24小时不停运作
I have the DNA sequencers going 24/7,

119
00:06:47,103 --> 00:06:49,533
同时我在用多重连接依赖式探针扩增法
and I'm running multiplex ligation-dependent probe

120
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:51,913
对所有已知毒性致病因子进行检测
amplifications for all known virulence factors.

121
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:55,583
很好  我们只有尽快找到可行治疗方法
Good. The sooner we have a viable treatment option,

122
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:58,563
才能尽快让茱莉亚回来  记住这点
the sooner we get Julia back. Just remember that.

123
00:06:58,733 --> 00:07:00,363
我先去看看我哥哥
I'm gonna check on my brother.

10124
00:07:01,493 --> 00:07:03,053
{\an8}隔离室
门已关闭
请输入密码

10125
00:07:05,143 --> 00:07:07,013
{\an8}情况危急

126
00:07:09,703 --> 00:07:11,313
吗啡好像不起作用
I'm afraid the morphine isn't helping.

127
00:07:11,313 --> 00:07:13,593
我知道这种症状  杜尚博士  他快不行了
I know the symptoms, Dr. Duchamp. He's dying.

128
00:07:13,653 --> 00:07:15,673
我们需要马上使用索迪拉进行治疗
We need to start the SODRA immediately.

129
00:07:15,673 --> 00:07:16,873
索迪拉疗法
The SODRA treatment has

130
00:07:16,873 --> 00:07:19,543
从未在人体上进行过测试  一次也没有
never been tested on humans beings. Not once.

131
00:07:19,543 --> 00:07:21,113
说不定会有效呢
That doesn't mean it won't work.

132
00:07:21,123 --> 00:07:23,133
它不是万能抗病毒治疗剂吗
It's a universal antiviral.

133
00:07:24,073 --> 00:07:26,523
我也希望我们有时间测试  可是情况紧急
I wish we had time for testing, but we don't.

134
00:07:29,413 --> 00:07:30,853
如果这是你的弟弟
If it were your brother,

135
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:32,993
难道你不会想尽一切办法救他吗
wouldn't you try everything you could?

136
00:07:32,993 --> 00:07:35,413
用未经临床测试的疗法杀人
Killing a human being with an untested treatment,

137
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,933
这是不道德的
it's unconscionable.

138
00:07:40,603 --> 00:07:43,703
如果病人无法做出明确指示
It's up to next of kin to give informed consent

139
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,953
那么病人的亲属有知情同意权
when the patient has left no clear directives,

140
00:07:46,313 --> 00:07:49,133
即使病人需要接受高度实验性治疗
even in the case of a highly- experimental treatment.

141
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:51,923
我同意了
I consent.

142
00:08:02,323 --> 00:08:04,183
拜耶塞罗少校
Major Balleseros.

143
00:08:04,653 --> 00:08:06,523
我听说你的卫星天线坏了
Heard about your satellite dish.

144
00:08:07,373 --> 00:08:08,683
真糟糕啊
Hell of a thing.

145
00:08:09,093 --> 00:08:10,983
你疯了吗
Are you out of your mind?

146
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:14,603
我倒觉得
I like to think

147
00:08:14,603 --> 00:08:17,163
我这么做是十分理智的决定
I'm bringing a little sanity to the proceedings.

148
00:08:18,173 --> 00:08:19,093
我在这的使命之一
Keeping the word from getting

149
00:08:19,103 --> 00:08:21,643
就是不让世人知道这里发生的破事
out on this shit-show is one of my imperatives.

150
00:08:21,643 --> 00:08:23,863
我也有自己的使命
I also have imperatives.

151
00:08:23,923 --> 00:08:24,420
自从来到这里
I've been waiting to hear

152
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,483
我就一直很好奇你的使命究竟是什么
what yours might be since I got here,

153
00:08:26,893 --> 00:08:29,413
但我可不想疾控中心或者你的疯子科学家
you know, before the CDC or one of your wingnut scientists

154
00:08:29,413 --> 00:08:30,843
将这一切公诸于世
shares it with the rest of the world.

155
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,583
我在这里的工作十分机密
My work here is protected,

156
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:35,433
-你无权知情  -不再如此了
- even from you. - Not anymore.

157
00:08:36,103 --> 00:08:37,163
你制造出了一种病毒
You made a virus that does

158
00:08:37,163 --> 00:08:39,393
跟你鼓吹的作用毫不相干
everything other than what you advertised.

159
00:08:43,193 --> 00:08:45,193
以你的智商  你根本没资格
You don't have the intellectual capacity

160
00:08:45,193 --> 00:08:47,123
评价我的工作
to evaluate my work.

161
00:08:50,103 --> 00:08:51,723
你想让事情变得容易些吗
You want things to get easier?

162
00:08:52,243 --> 00:08:55,173
那就把你许诺给上头的成果弄出来
Produce the results you promised our employers.

163
00:08:55,173 --> 00:08:57,893
-环境警报  -发生什么了
- Environmental alert. - What's going on?

164
00:08:58,423 --> 00:08:59,673
-空气感应器警报被触发  -环境警报
- Atmosphere sensor alert. - Environmental alert.

10165
00:09:04,183 --> 00:09:05,913
{\an8}氧气水平
二氧化碳水平

10166
00:09:08,153 --> 00:09:10,883
{\an8}再生系统关闭

167
00:09:04,073 --> 00:09:06,133
二氧化碳含量在上升
CO2 levels are rising.

168
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,623
有人把氧气净化器关掉了
Someone's shut off the oxygen scrubbers.

169
00:09:11,123 --> 00:09:11,803
很糟糕吗
Is that bad?

170
00:09:11,803 --> 00:09:12,913
环境警报
Environmental alert.

171
00:09:12,913 --> 00:09:14,793
只要你想呼吸  就糟得很
Only if you like breathing.

172
00:09:17,903 --> 00:09:19,223
环境警报
Environmental alert.

173
00:09:23,093 --> 00:09:26,273
控制节点离旧生热学实验室30米远
Control node is 30 meters from the old thermogenics lab.

174
00:09:26,343 --> 00:09:28,193
装有模拟控制开关
It was engineered with analog override switches

175
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,043
以控制氧气净化器
for the oxygen scrubbers.

176
00:09:30,213 --> 00:09:33,143
-是软件故障吗  -开关都基于硬件编码
- System malfunction? - They used a hardwired code.

177
00:09:33,243 --> 00:09:35,563
我推测是那些人想逼我们下到R层
My guess is they want to force us down to Level R.

178
00:09:35,563 --> 00:09:38,753
这是以断氧要挟我们去谈判
It's a blackmail play to get us to negotiate.

179
00:09:39,143 --> 00:09:40,243
还能维持多长时间
How much time?

180
00:09:40,243 --> 00:09:43,123
六小时后二氧化碳水平将达到临界值
Six hours before CO2 levels hit the redline.

181
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:45,713
再过两小时  我们就会感到不适
In two hours we can expect to start suffering

182
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:47,413
头痛  反胃  呕吐
headaches, nausea, vomiting--

183
00:09:47,413 --> 00:09:51,853
那好  我们抄家伙下去谈判吧
All right. Let's get some weapons, and go negotiate.

184
00:09:53,973 --> 00:09:56,913
他们肯定设了埋伏  我们都会被扣作人质
They'll have an ambush ready. We'd be taken hostage.

185
00:09:56,923 --> 00:09:58,613
也只有你担心这个
Speak for yourself.

186
00:10:00,983 --> 00:10:04,033
-我们到底怎么做  -不需要你插手
- What do we do? - We do nothing.

187
00:10:04,573 --> 00:10:06,883
我会亲自解决这件事
I will handle this personally.

188
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:09,673
就像你亲自"解决"其他事那样吗
Like you've handled everything else?

189
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,073
我这就带一队安保人员下去
I'll take a security team downstairs.

190
00:10:19,073 --> 00:10:22,103
不用带人  你和我就行
No security team; just you and me.

191
00:10:22,313 --> 00:10:23,713
你也去吗
You're going?

192
00:10:24,513 --> 00:10:27,183
这座基地努力多年才得以建成
It took many years to build this base.

193
00:10:28,273 --> 00:10:30,983
如果有人想毁掉它
I won't sit by while someone tries

194
00:10:30,983 --> 00:10:32,603
我绝不会坐视不理
to destroy it.

195
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:35,343
张嘴
Open up.

196
00:10:40,303 --> 00:10:42,383
你就直说了吧  我被感染了吗
Just get it over with. Am I infected?

197
00:10:42,503 --> 00:10:44,863
头痛是非常常见的病状
Headache is a very general symptom.

198
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,873
你不会有事的  除非你产生幻觉
It's not as if you're hallucinating

199
00:10:46,883 --> 00:10:50,203
或者开始情绪不稳  暴躁易怒
or experiencing labile emotions and uncontrollable anger.

200
00:10:50,703 --> 00:10:51,733
迟早的事
Not yet.

201
00:10:55,993 --> 00:10:57,603
检测结果证明你没被感染
Test says you're clear.

202
00:10:59,853 --> 00:11:00,923
那这是怎么回事
What about this?

203
00:11:02,243 --> 00:11:05,433
这可能只是压力过大导致的心身性反应
It's possible that it's a psychosomatic response to stress.

204
00:11:05,433 --> 00:11:07,853
这不是我幻想出来的  你还不明白吗
This is not in my head! Don't you get that?

205
00:11:08,453 --> 00:11:09,753
你需要平复一下情绪
You need to calm down.

206
00:11:10,953 --> 00:11:12,113
你说得倒轻巧
That's easy for you to say.

207
00:11:12,113 --> 00:11:14,173
染上致命病毒的人又不是你
You're not the one with a deadly disease.

208
00:11:17,383 --> 00:11:19,093
别让他们把我送下去
Don't let them send me down there.

209
00:11:19,213 --> 00:11:23,913
求你了  一旦被送下去  我再也回不来了
Please? If I go down there, I'll never come back up.

210
00:11:26,573 --> 00:11:28,653
别激动  我们可不是
Hey. We're not just

211
00:11:28,653 --> 00:11:30,803
把感染者送下去等死的
sending people down there to die.

212
00:11:31,563 --> 00:11:32,723
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

213
00:11:33,903 --> 00:11:35,403
那只是你个人的想法而已
That's what you think.

214
00:11:36,513 --> 00:11:38,123
你不了解x宏这个人
You don't know Hatake.

215
00:11:38,123 --> 00:11:39,953
那你也不了解法拉格特博士
And you don't know Dr. Farragut.

216
00:11:40,893 --> 00:11:43,153
他绝不会让我们出任何事的
He's not gonna let anything happen to us.

217
00:11:47,563 --> 00:11:49,533
希望你是对的  莎拉
I hope I can trust you, Sarah.

218
00:12:02,093 --> 00:12:03,593
呼吸  要呼吸  彼得
Breathe. Breathe, Peter.

219
00:12:09,893 --> 00:12:10,933
没事的
It's OK.

220
00:12:17,473 --> 00:12:20,213
彼得  没事的  会没事的
Peter, it'll be OK. It'll be OK.

221
00:12:21,963 --> 00:12:23,883
剂量调节器有问题了吗
Something wrong with the dose regulator?

222
00:12:24,023 --> 00:12:26,393
不管我说什么也拦不住你了是吗
Is there anything I can tell you to make you stop?

223
00:12:29,323 --> 00:12:30,273
没错
No.

224
00:12:46,323 --> 00:12:49,353
呼吸  呼吸
Breathe. Breathe.

225
00:12:58,303 --> 00:13:01,103
-氧气要耗尽了吗  -反正我还能呼吸
- We out of air yet? - I'm still breathing.

226
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:05,193
上次我给你的样本你检测出结果了吗
Did you get any results from that sample I gave you?

227
00:13:06,043 --> 00:13:07,883
你想从我这要答案  你也得给我答案
You want answers, I want answers.

228
00:13:07,883 --> 00:13:09,313
明白现在的局面了吧
See how that works?

229
00:13:09,893 --> 00:13:12,663
我完全应该把这些情况报告给艾伦
There's no reason I shouldn't be telling Alan what's what.

230
00:13:12,663 --> 00:13:15,103
你想让我接着忙活你这个小实验
You want me to keep working on your little pet project?

231
00:13:16,773 --> 00:13:17,763
先给我个理由
Give me a reason.

232
00:13:18,503 --> 00:13:20,023
也许你没注意  但这有人处心积虑
Maybe you haven't noticed, but there are people that

233
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:22,463
不想让基地里的秘密泄露出去
don't want what's inside this base getting out.

234
00:13:23,493 --> 00:13:26,853
我是既缺觉  又缺咖啡  还过不了烟瘾 
I haven't had nearly enough sleep, coffee, or cigarettes

235
00:13:26,853 --> 00:13:30,053
再多点这种破事我可要受不了了
to deal with any more of this Fox Mulder crap from you.

236
00:13:31,613 --> 00:13:32,613
朵琳
Doreen.

237
00:13:33,593 --> 00:13:35,833
我接下来要告诉你的事  你如果泄露出去
If you tell another living soul what I'm about to say,

238
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,703
我会惹上大麻烦
I end up in a hurt locker.

239
00:13:38,233 --> 00:13:40,133
我们现在的状况好得到哪去吗
You mean as opposed to this paradise?

240
00:13:41,463 --> 00:13:44,233
我是国防部特别调查小组的人
I'm with a special investigative section in the Pentagon.

241
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:48,000
我来是为了对这里的秘密非法研究
I was sent as part of an internal inquiry

242
00:13:48,001 --> 00:13:49,963
进行内部调查
for a black-bag research operation.

243
00:13:49,993 --> 00:13:52,603
那你干嘛一开始不说
Well, why didn't you say so in the first place?

244
00:13:52,613 --> 00:13:53,923
别让我后悔告诉你这事
Don't make me regret this.

245
00:13:55,698 --> 00:13:56,904
好吧
Ok.

246
00:13:57,123 --> 00:14:02,363
那么说  你的上级...认为病毒是武器吗
So, your superiors... think the virus is a weapon?

247
00:14:02,363 --> 00:14:04,163
武器是用来消灭敌人的
Weapons get rid of the enemy;

248
00:14:04,163 --> 00:14:06,673
但这病毒似乎会让敌人变得更危险
this thing seems to make them even more dangerous.

249
00:14:06,843 --> 00:14:08,745
我们只知道这是一个不受政府掌控
What we have is a hidden base

250
00:14:08,746 --> 00:14:10,993
秘密进行非法研究的隐密基地
conducting secret research outside of the reach of any government.

251
00:14:10,993 --> 00:14:13,073
没人了解真实情况
No one knows the bigger picture.

252
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:13,543
你觉得你就了解吗
And you think you do?

253
00:14:14,503 --> 00:14:16,743
我听德特里克堡的病菌专家们谈到
I heard these germ docs over at Fort Detrick

254
00:14:14,503 --> 00:14:16,743
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}美国生物防御计划中心

255
00:14:16,743 --> 00:14:19,463
用病毒运输DNA
talking about using viruses to move DNA around.

256
00:14:19,463 --> 00:14:22,073
-基因运载工具吗  -对  就是这个
- Gene delivery vehicles? - Yeah, that was it.

257
00:14:22,413 --> 00:14:24,803
或许病毒就像货车一样
What if this virus is acting like a freight train

258
00:14:24,813 --> 00:14:26,773
将这些奇怪的DNA送进了宿主体内呢
pulling some weird-ass DNA behind it?

259
00:14:29,313 --> 00:14:33,203
也有可能  你也不像表面看上去那么蠢嘛
Maybe... you're not as dumb as you look.

260
00:14:34,683 --> 00:14:36,823
我会对病毒进行基因测序
I'll run the virus through the gene sequencer.

261
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,563
记着点  空气就快耗完  时间不多了
Try to remember that we are running out of air.

262
00:15:52,898 --> 00:15:55,658
你可以把防毒面罩拿下来  病毒不是空气传播的
You can take the gas mask off. The virus isn't airborne.

263
00:15:57,948 --> 00:15:59,778
你有什么症状吗
Are you experiencing any symptoms?

264
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:03,748
恶心  发热  排出黑色粘液
Nausea, fever, black mucus discharge?

265
00:16:08,878 --> 00:16:12,468
我保证  我跟他不一样
I promise... I'm not like him.

266
00:16:13,798 --> 00:16:14,918
如果我真的发疯了
If I start going crazy,

267
00:16:14,918 --> 00:16:17,218
我允许你用刚才闩在门上的
you have my permission to beat me to death with that stick

268
00:16:17,218 --> 00:16:18,988
那根棍子把我打死
that you suck in the door, just right now.

269
00:16:18,998 --> 00:16:20,848
我只是想谢谢你救了我
I'd like to thank my rescuer.

270
00:16:25,158 --> 00:16:26,468
求你了
Please.

271
00:16:35,968 --> 00:16:37,148
手套我就不脱了
I'm keeping my gloves on.

272
00:16:37,158 --> 00:16:38,208
我理解
Fair enough.

273
00:16:43,468 --> 00:16:44,518
你叫什么
What's your name?

274
00:16:44,718 --> 00:16:46,678
-杰伊  -没有什么头衔吗
- Jaye. - Just Jaye?

275
00:16:47,528 --> 00:16:50,578
我有硕士博士学位各种乱七八糟的
I'm an MD, PhD, blah, blah, blah.

276
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:53,258
后面有整个字母表的头衔  如果有差别的话
Got an alphabet soup after my name if that makes any difference.

277
00:16:53,258 --> 00:16:54,438
没差别
It doesn't.

278
00:16:56,818 --> 00:16:59,318
-我是茱莉亚  茱莉亚・沃克  -我知道你是谁
- I'm Julia. Julia Walker-- - I know who you are.

279
00:16:59,358 --> 00:17:01,518
你是疾控中心的那妞
You're that CDC chick.

280
00:17:02,578 --> 00:17:04,488
我挺喜欢这样的叫法
I kinda like the sound of that.

281
00:17:07,688 --> 00:17:09,098
我不想表现得像个粗鲁的客人
I hate to be a crappy houseguest,

282
00:17:09,098 --> 00:17:11,698
但你有吃的或者喝的吗
but you got anything to eat or drink around here?

283
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,178
随意看看吧
Look around.

284
00:17:14,188 --> 00:17:17,238
这就是我的家了  喜欢吗
You just got the grand tour. You like it?

285
00:17:19,218 --> 00:17:21,608
这样的话  我更宁愿待在蒙大拿
All in all, I'd rather be in Montana.

286
00:17:24,548 --> 00:17:27,588
x宏在各种藏身之处都放了食物贮存柜
Hatake stashed MRE lockers in strategic locations -

287
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,448
以防有朝一日事态失去控制
You know, in case the shit ever hit the fan.

288
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:31,848
-要我说这绝对是时候了  -对
- Oh, I'd say this qualifies. - Yeah.

289
00:17:35,018 --> 00:17:37,948
2小时36分钟内  依据杜尚疗法
Two hours, 36 minutes, the first two infusions

290

修改版程序  病人注射了头两次
of the SODRA antiviral have been administered

291
00:17:41,098 --> 00:17:43,288
索迪拉抗病毒药剂
under the modified Duchamp protocols.

292
00:17:44,158 --> 00:17:46,858
病人情况显著稳定
Patient marginally stabilizing.

293
00:17:59,318 --> 00:18:01,028
你就想着这么解脱吗
Is this how you want to go out?

294
00:18:03,058 --> 00:18:05,858
还记得那时候你是个有种
The kid who had the balls to go through

295
00:18:05,858 --> 00:18:08,198
在父亲昏倒之后掏他口袋的小孩吗
Dad's pockets when he was passed out?

296
00:18:08,518 --> 00:18:12,568
本来我俩五五分钱  你说服我七三开
The kid who talked me down from a 50/50 to a 70/30 split

297
00:18:12,568 --> 00:18:15,028
而且说得像是给了我面子一样
and made it seem like he was doing me a favor?

298
00:18:25,228 --> 00:18:27,258
如果当时不是你
I would not have survived

299
00:18:27,928 --> 00:18:29,598
我可能早死了
if you hadn't been there.

300
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,608
那男人...
What that man...

301
00:18:36,508 --> 00:18:38,738
那男人对我们做的...
what that man did to us...

302
00:18:40,838 --> 00:18:42,678
这是我欠你的
I owe you this.

303
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:50,178
而你欠我的
And you owe me...

304
00:18:51,778 --> 00:18:53,438
是那个晚上
for that night.

305
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,208
环境警报
Environmental alert.

10306
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:15,698
{\an8}警告  氧气浓度已低至临界值

307
00:19:14,258 --> 00:19:15,918
环境警报
Environmental alert.

308
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,298
我的头好痛
My head hurts.

309
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,398
你有强效一点的药吗
Do you have anything stronger?

310
00:19:26,278 --> 00:19:28,348
我给你的非甾体类消炎药[镇痛药物]
I've given you the highest dosage of NSAID...

311
00:19:28,348 --> 00:19:29,838
已经是最高剂量了
NSAIDs I can.

312
00:19:31,348 --> 00:19:33,528
没关系  我不在乎肝脏损伤的副作用
I'm not worried about hurting my liver.

313
00:19:35,028 --> 00:19:37,418
你重新确认了快速反应测试的结果吗
Did you recheck your rapid response tests?

314
00:19:39,318 --> 00:19:40,358
是的
I did.

315
00:19:43,108 --> 00:19:44,888
没有任何问题
There's nothing wrong with it.

316
00:19:46,548 --> 00:19:48,908
你说过你会试着更关心我一些
You said you'd step up the care packages.

317
00:19:49,748 --> 00:19:52,498
但一周就那几次语音通信远远不够
It's not enough to Skype with me a couple times a week.

318
00:19:52,508 --> 00:19:53,558
你说什么
Excuse me?

319
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:55,238
你总是沉默不语
The silences...

320
00:19:55,588 --> 00:19:57,058
缜默无言
the pauses.

321
00:19:57,098 --> 00:19:58,458
你就不能痛快点做个了断
Why don't you just tell me her name

322
00:19:58,458 --> 00:19:59,728
告诉我她的名字吗
and get it over with?

323
00:19:59,808 --> 00:20:02,948
这冰洞里多得是人愿意和我在一起
There's tons of guys on this ice hole who'd love to be with me.

324
00:20:02,948 --> 00:20:04,438
你在和谁说话
Who are you talking to?

325
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:07,888
一个如果仍不知悔改  就即将成为我前男友的人
My ex-boyfriend if he doesn't step up his game.

326
00:20:08,618 --> 00:20:09,788
你听见我说的了吗
Did you hear me?

327
00:20:09,788 --> 00:20:12,208
我才不会守在你身边等你想清楚
'Cause I'm not gonna wait around for you to figure it out.

328
00:20:13,718 --> 00:20:14,558
不要走
Don't go.

329
00:20:15,158 --> 00:20:16,238
你出现幻觉了
You're hallucinating,

330
00:20:16,288 --> 00:20:18,168
说明我们的测试并不管用
which means that our test doesn't work.

331
00:20:19,758 --> 00:20:21,068
-我得告诉艾伦  -求你了
- I need to tell Alan. - Please.

332
00:20:21,068 --> 00:20:21,828
你不能告诉别人
You can't tell anyone.

333
00:20:21,828 --> 00:20:23,568
我不能让你留在这里  你病了
I can't keep you here. You're sick.

334
00:20:24,088 --> 00:20:25,658
我不是唯一有病的人
I'm not the only one.

335
00:20:26,488 --> 00:20:28,558
你什么时候知道自己长了肿瘤的
How long have you known about your tumor?

336
00:20:31,678 --> 00:20:34,248
-我没有肿瘤  -别骗我了
- I don't have a tumor. - Please.

337
00:20:34,428 --> 00:20:36,078
我可是个肿瘤学家
I'm an oncologist.

338
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:39,088
言语不清  不受控制的颤抖
Slurring speech, tremors,

339
00:20:39,248 --> 00:20:41,398
还有处方药加巴喷丁
prescription vial of Gabapentin.

340
00:20:45,178 --> 00:20:46,708
我谁也没告诉
I haven't told anyone.

341
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:51,128
医患特权可以是双向的
Doctor-patient privilege goes both ways.

342
00:20:51,618 --> 00:20:53,188
不如我们彼此为对方保密
It'll be our secret.

343
00:21:00,508 --> 00:21:01,878
这一般要用多久
How long does this usually take?

344
00:21:01,888 --> 00:21:03,528
谁也说不准
As long as it takes.

345
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:05,028
这些事情急不得
You can't rush these things.

346
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:06,318
这玩意非常重要
This is the real deal --

347
00:21:06,318 --> 00:21:08,248
构造生命的基础什么的
building blocks of life and all that.

348
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:11,528
你放的这破音乐很难让人保持耐心
It's hard to be patient listening to your crappy music.

349
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,388
告诉我你终于发现了什么
Please tell me that means something.

350
00:21:15,388 --> 00:21:16,618
是的
Oh, yes.

351
00:21:17,448 --> 00:21:19,178
和我的小伙伴打个招呼吧
Say hello to my little friend.

352
00:21:19,178 --> 00:21:22,278
病毒的核糖核酸图可以显示一些隐藏信息
An RNA map of the virus should show us what's under the hood.

353
00:21:23,918 --> 00:21:24,938
好奇怪
Weird.

10354
00:21:25,448 --> 00:21:28,738
{\an8}未知蛋白结构

355
00:21:26,478 --> 00:21:28,328
我从没见过这种组合结构
I've never seen this combination before.

356
00:21:29,378 --> 00:21:29,948
这说明什么
Meaning?

357
00:21:29,948 --> 00:21:32,908
说明有人特意设计出这种病毒
Meaning someone designed this virus,

358
00:21:33,428 --> 00:21:35,728
这绝对不是大自然的产物
and it sure as shit wasn't Mother Nature.

359
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:38,158
这是人类制造出来的
We're looking at the hand of man here.

360
00:21:38,508 --> 00:21:42,678
这种特殊的蛋白质结构设计能把病毒
Proteins specifically designed to bind the virus to specific

361
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:45,668
绑在特定的细胞上以传递它的遗传信息
cells so it can deliver its genetic message.

362
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:46,698
什么信息
What's the message?

363
00:21:47,298 --> 00:21:48,948
你知道他们设计这种病毒有什么用吗
Can you tell what they designed it to do?

364
00:21:49,418 --> 00:21:50,478
我不知道
No.

365
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,688
但是我能弄明白
But I can find out.

366
00:22:12,068 --> 00:22:13,128
莎拉
Hey, Sarah.

367
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:15,828
他怎么样了
How is he?

368
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:18,338
至少他有氧气瓶用
At least he has bottled oxygen,

369
00:22:18,788 --> 00:22:20,138
不像我们
unlike the rest of us.

370
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:23,878
你还好吗  开始感到缺氧了吗
You Ok? You feeling the CO2 yet?

371
00:22:24,648 --> 00:22:25,658
还没有
No.

372
00:22:31,728 --> 00:22:33,058
我...
I, um...

373
00:22:34,518 --> 00:22:35,508
我刚才...
I was...

374
00:22:35,638 --> 00:22:37,678
找出了之前快速反应测试的结果
going over the rapid response test.

375
00:22:37,678 --> 00:22:40,758
重新检查了一遍
I was... I was rechecking them.

376
00:22:40,758 --> 00:22:42,168
结果...
And, um...

377
00:22:44,088 --> 00:22:45,108
艾伦
Alan.

378
00:22:50,688 --> 00:22:51,658
彼得
Peter?

379
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,018
彼得  你能看见我吗
Peter, can you see me?

380
00:22:58,288 --> 00:22:59,678
我当然能看见你
Of course I can see you.

381
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:06,158
那个美女是谁
Who's the pretty one?

382
00:23:10,628 --> 00:23:12,998
莎拉...  莎拉  这是...
Sarah... Sarah, this...

383
00:23:13,528 --> 00:23:15,378
这是我弟弟  彼得
this is my brother Peter.

384
00:23:24,493 --> 00:23:26,923
莎拉  你刚才想说什么
Sarah, you had something you wanted to tell me

385
00:23:26,923 --> 00:23:28,873
快速反应测试怎么了
about the rapid response test?

386
00:23:35,273 --> 00:23:36,373
测试不管用
It doesn't work.

387
00:23:41,303 --> 00:23:42,843
什么叫不管用
What do you mean it doesn't work?

388
00:23:42,843 --> 00:23:44,643
我当时在把结果整理归档
I was archiving the results,

389
00:23:45,303 --> 00:23:48,543
结果发现了细胞循环程序里的一个缺陷
and I found a flaw in the cell line cycling protocol.

390
00:23:48,553 --> 00:23:51,093
我们不能相信那些结果
We can't trust any of the results.

391
00:23:51,093 --> 00:23:53,463
这层有感染者吗
Are there any infected on this floor?

392
00:23:53,843 --> 00:23:55,673
没  至少还没有人上报
No. No one's reported in,

393
00:23:55,673 --> 00:23:58,883
但我们不能肯定楼下的人是否都被感染了
but we can't trust that everyone downstairs is a positive.

394
00:24:01,063 --> 00:24:02,943
很抱歉我让你失望了
I'm really sorry I let you down.

395
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:06,713
-还有沃克  -别这么说
- And Walker. - No, no

396
00:24:06,713 --> 00:24:08,163
是我的失误  我责无旁贷
I made a mistake. There's no excuse.

397
00:24:08,163 --> 00:24:10,053
现在你要做的就是弥补它
Right now you get to fix it.

398
00:24:10,053 --> 00:24:13,003
-你找出漏洞了吗  -我还在努力
- Have you isolated the flaw? - I'm working on it.

399
00:24:13,003 --> 00:24:14,703
好的  抓紧时间
All right, work faster.

400
00:24:14,763 --> 00:24:17,333
然后去找x博士  告诉他我们需要进行
Then find Hatake and tell him we need to implement

401
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:19,503
全基地范围的重新检测
a base-wide retesting protocol,

402
00:24:19,533 --> 00:24:21,203
然后解除R层的封锁  好吗
then open Level R, all right?

403
00:24:21,203 --> 00:24:22,873
这事越快办妥
The sooner this gets done,

404
00:24:22,883 --> 00:24:25,063
我们就能越早将那些人放出来
the sooner we can get those people out of there.

405
00:24:26,263 --> 00:24:27,183
好
Right.

406
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:33,473
刚从安保人员那反馈来的消息
Security's checking in.

407
00:24:33,623 --> 00:24:36,893
人们已经开始出现头痛和虚弱现象
People are reporting headaches, fatigue,

408
00:24:36,893 --> 00:24:39,023
这些都是早期二氧化碳中毒的症状
which are early signs of CO2 poisoning.

409
00:24:39,023 --> 00:24:41,933
我们必须尽快去R层解决这个问题
We need to get down to Level R and handle this.

410
00:24:44,643 --> 00:24:45,753
这是什么
What am I looking at?

411
00:24:49,723 --> 00:24:51,043
准许进入
Access granted.

412
00:25:16,173 --> 00:25:18,133
我不知道要怎么说才好  但是
I don't know quite how to say this, but...

413
00:25:19,953 --> 00:25:24,413
自从你感染后  这里的情况便急转直下
things have gone downhill since you were infected.

414
00:25:25,573 --> 00:25:26,653
真的吗
No shit?

415
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:29,263
彼得
Peter.

416
00:25:33,363 --> 00:25:34,553
我知道你很虚弱
I know you're weak,

417
00:25:35,703 --> 00:25:37,923
但是我有好多疑问
but I have so many questions

418
00:25:38,273 --> 00:25:41,023
关于你这里的工作  关于这个地方
about your work here, about this... this place.

419
00:25:42,983 --> 00:25:46,953
七三分  你一点风险都不需要承担
Seventy-thirty? You're not taking any of the risk.

420
00:25:48,563 --> 00:25:52,283
-什么  -好吧  六四分  最终价
- What? - OK, all right, 60-40, final offer.

421
00:25:53,033 --> 00:25:55,623
谁知道那老头口袋里到底装着什么呢
You never know what's gonna come out of the old man's pockets.

422
00:26:00,363 --> 00:26:03,093
-行  那就六四分  哥们  -那好  
- Sixty-forty is just fine with me, buddy. - Ok.

423
00:26:03,093 --> 00:26:05,953
你去藏起来  我到手了就去找你
You go hide. I'll find you when it's done.

424
00:26:06,283 --> 00:26:09,213
如果你愿意  我更想在这陪着你
I will stay right here with you if that's ok.

425
00:26:09,213 --> 00:26:12,203
-很危险的  -我知道  没关系
- It's dangerous. - I know. It's ok.

426
00:26:12,633 --> 00:26:13,573
没关系的
It's ok.

427
00:26:14,363 --> 00:26:16,393
弗莱明指挥官牙买加朗姆酒
Fleming's Commander Jamaica rum.

428
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:19,053
什么
What?

429
00:26:19,053 --> 00:26:20,973
老头子常喝的酒
That was the old man's poison.

430
00:26:21,943 --> 00:26:25,113
感觉波旁威士忌更适合他这种卑鄙小人
You'd think a mean scumbag like him would be a bourbon drunk.

431
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:30,583
-你试过那玩意吗  -他死了
- You ever try that stuff? - He's dead.

432
00:26:32,103 --> 00:26:34,023
很久以前就死了  他不会
Been gone a long time. He can't...

433
00:26:35,303 --> 00:26:36,893
再伤害我们了
hurt us anymore.

434
00:26:40,343 --> 00:26:43,053
估计是因为被困在这种地方
Something about being trapped in this place...

435
00:26:44,553 --> 00:26:47,073
我总会时不时看到那混蛋
I see that bastard around every corner.

436
00:27:06,473 --> 00:27:07,543
什么都没有
Snake eyes.

437
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,473
让我们进去
Hey! Let us in!

438
00:27:15,473 --> 00:27:16,743
别那么大声  杰伊
Not so loud, Jaye.

439
00:27:18,353 --> 00:27:20,583
给我闭嘴  你会引来带菌者的
Shut the hell up! You're gonna attract the vectors!

440
00:27:20,583 --> 00:27:23,023
-那就开门  -我们没地方了
- Then open the door. - We don't have any room.

441
00:27:23,403 --> 00:27:24,913
胡扯  让我们进去
Bullshit. Let us in.

442
00:27:26,753 --> 00:27:28,153
求你了
Please!

443
00:27:29,463 --> 00:27:30,463
你听到了吗
Do you hear that?

444
00:27:30,593 --> 00:27:32,913
-让我们进去  -闭嘴  过来
- Let us in! - Shut up. Come on.

445
00:27:50,403 --> 00:27:51,993
他怎么样
How is he?

446
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:55,083
他一直在不停地回忆我们的童年
Well, he won't talk about much of anything but our childhood.

447
00:27:55,653 --> 00:27:56,473
精神错乱吗
Delirium?

448
00:27:56,473 --> 00:28:00,253
应该不是  他的情况时好时坏
Uh, no. I mean, he's in and out of it, but, uh,

449
00:28:00,743 --> 00:28:02,723
我不知道  很难说  他好像
I don't know, it's hard to say. He just...

450
00:28:02,993 --> 00:28:04,453
好像陷在了过去当中
He's stuck back there.

451
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:07,053
这是病毒数量对比吗
Are these the viral load comparisons?

452
00:28:07,443 --> 00:28:11,613
病毒数量在注射索迪拉后有所下降  但是现在
They were declining after the SODRA infusions took hold, but now...

453
00:28:14,023 --> 00:28:16,113
看起来病毒正在回侵
This looks like the virus is coming back -

454
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:17,783
而且来势更加凶猛
with a vengeance.

455
00:28:19,133 --> 00:28:20,923
你知道我们是孤注一掷
You knew we were taking a chance.

456
00:28:21,853 --> 00:28:24,133
-我很遗憾  -但是它起了作用
- I'm sorry. - But it was working.

457
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:27,283
或许我们可以再增加剂量
I mean, maybe we could... we could be more aggressive.

458
00:28:27,283 --> 00:28:30,713
我们给他的剂量已经远远超出了我的试验用量
We've already given him a larger dose than any of my studies.

459
00:28:31,863 --> 00:28:35,543
再多就很有可能会引起免疫性中毒
Any more could trigger a cascade of antiviral toxicity.

460
00:28:35,663 --> 00:28:37,073
我们无能为力了
There's nothing we can do.

461
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:41,253
他还有多久时间
How long does he have?

462
00:28:42,903 --> 00:28:45,133
如果你还有什么要对他说的
If you've got anything to say to him...

463
00:28:48,503 --> 00:28:50,493
好好把握这最后的机会吧
...take this time and make the most of it.

464
00:28:57,753 --> 00:28:59,363
彼得  我们得谈谈
Peter, we need to talk about...

465
00:29:00,843 --> 00:29:03,413
-我们尝试的疗法  -你这语气听着不妙
- The treatment we're trying is... - Aw, hell, I know that tone.

466
00:29:03,423 --> 00:29:04,413
...仍停留在试验阶段
...highly experimental.

467
00:29:04,413 --> 00:29:05,653
每当妈妈病情加重的时候
Every time mom took a turn,

468
00:29:05,663 --> 00:29:08,223
你脸上就会出现这副悲惨的表情
you've have that sad-sack look on your face.

469
00:29:09,223 --> 00:29:10,173
有多糟
How bad?

470
00:29:12,923 --> 00:29:15,613
天呐  你就直说吧
Aw, Jesus, don't sugar-coat it.

471
00:29:16,743 --> 00:29:17,783
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

472
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:27,353
但我必须要问你一些问题
I have to ask some questions.

473
00:29:27,743 --> 00:29:30,683
目前这里发生的事情我们没办法解释
There are things going on here that we can't explain.

474
00:29:30,683 --> 00:29:32,053
你认为我可以吗
And you think I can?

475
00:29:32,173 --> 00:29:34,393
发生的这一切或许与你的研究有关
Some of it may have to do with your research.

476
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,433
你向来是家里最聪明的那个
Well, you were the genius in the family,

477
00:29:36,433 --> 00:29:37,393
难道你没发现
and you couldn't figure out

478
00:29:37,393 --> 00:29:39,483
我在这里做的都是不起眼的杂活吗
that I've been doing shit work up here?

479
00:29:40,003 --> 00:29:40,893
你是什么意思
What do you mean?

480
00:29:40,893 --> 00:29:42,553
我本以为x宏招募我
I thought Hatake recruited me

481
00:29:42,553 --> 00:29:44,513
是让我来做高端前沿的科研
to do next-gen stuff.

482
00:29:44,863 --> 00:29:46,553
我以为自己大显身手的机会到了
This was gonna be my ticket to the show.

483
00:29:46,553 --> 00:29:48,843
告诉我关于病毒的事
Just tell me about the virus.

484
00:29:48,844 --> 00:29:52,243
x宏让我为其他医生做动物尸检
Hatake had me doing animal necropsies for the other docs.

485
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:53,853
我一直都得不到重用
I was never the alpha.

486
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:58,653
他对我唯一感兴趣的一点就是
The only part of my life Hatake seemed interested in was...

487
00:30:00,793 --> 00:30:01,813
茱莉亚
...Julia.

488
00:30:03,763 --> 00:30:05,163
他是怎么知道她的
How did he know about her?

489
00:30:06,313 --> 00:30:07,763
他到处都有耳目
He's got ears everywhere.

490
00:30:08,643 --> 00:30:11,273
我是说  在这里大家都喜欢向他倾诉
I mean, he was the one around here who ever wanted to talk.

491
00:30:19,273 --> 00:30:21,813
是我逼你出走  我欠你更多
I drove you away. I owed you better.

492
00:30:22,783 --> 00:30:24,353
别反驳  你知道事实如此
No, you know I'm right.

493
00:30:26,073 --> 00:30:28,473
我本来应该在那里的  可是我
I could have been there, but I didn't...

494
00:30:30,713 --> 00:30:32,033
我不想再继续亏欠你
...I didn't want to owe you anymore -

495
00:30:32,033 --> 00:30:34,283
不管是因为爸爸  还是其他任何人
not for dad, not for anyone.

496
00:30:34,283 --> 00:30:36,713
-别说了  -是你一直在照看着我
- Don't do that. - You were the one who stuck up for me.

497
00:30:36,713 --> 00:30:37,373
你为了保护我
You were the one

498
00:30:37,373 --> 00:30:39,153
-毅然与父亲对抗  -不是这样的
- running interference with the old man. - It was never like that.

499
00:30:39,273 --> 00:30:40,043
我一直都嫉妒你
I envied you.

500
00:30:40,053 --> 00:30:43,673
-所以我才没去  -从她出现的那一刻起
- That's why I wasn't there. - From the moment she showed up...

501
00:30:43,683 --> 00:30:48,133
所以你们两个那天晚上
That's why the two of you ended up together.

502
00:30:49,393 --> 00:30:52,083
-才会在一起  -不只是那一晚
- That night. - It wasn't just that night.

503
00:30:54,773 --> 00:30:55,863
我们在之前就开始了
It was before.

504
00:30:57,413 --> 00:31:00,873
每隔一段时间  我们都会一起出差参加会议
Every once in a while, when we'd travel to some conference.

505
00:31:02,863 --> 00:31:06,853
即使当你阻止了我们后  我们也很清楚
Even after you ended things, we knew we...

506
00:31:07,573 --> 00:31:09,283
我们不会停止见面的
we couldn't stop seeing each other.

507
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:13,323
所以我才会来这里
That's why I came up here.

508
00:31:15,253 --> 00:31:16,603
我无法控制自己
I couldn't stay away.

509
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:19,963
所以只能有多远走多远
I went as far as I could.

510
00:31:26,513 --> 00:31:27,723
真的很对不起
I'm so sorry.

511
00:31:35,523 --> 00:31:36,733
他要不行了
He's crashing!

512
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:27,970
x博士
Dr. Hatake?

513
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,100
加巴喷丁
Gabapentin.

514
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,620
加巴喷丁  在哪里  到底在哪里
Gabapentin, come on, come on!

10515
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:27,650
{\an8}硫酸吗啡

516
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:34,240
索迪拉疗程过后三小时
Three hours after completion of SODRA protocol,

517
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,220
病人心脏停搏
patient experienced cardiac arrest

518
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:40,690
并伴有严重的病毒性败血症
congruent with overwhelming viremic sepsis.

519
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,160
此次恶化
This time,

520
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,540
导致脑电波活动急剧下降
with concomitant catastrophic decrease in brainwave activity.

521
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,610
病人经过除颤器抢救后
Patient has been fitted with a defib vest,

522
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:54,460
目前处于植物人状态
is now intubated and on artificial respiration

523
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,910
只能靠插管维持人工呼吸
in a vegetative state.

524
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,320
病人几乎不可能重新恢复知觉
It's unlikely that the patient will regain consciousness

525
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:03,410
或脱离呼吸机自主生存
or be able to maintain his own life without the ventilator.

526
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:15,250
我能感觉到他们抓住了我  想拖我走
I can feel their hands on me, dragging me away.

527
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:17,390
求求你快阻止他们
Please make them stop.

528
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:18,940
没事的  闭上眼睛
Shh, close your eyes,

529
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,490
听医生的话  把眼睛闭上
close your eyes. Doctor's orders.

530
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,150
一切会没事的
Everything's gonna be fine.

531
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,050
我不会让他们把你带走的  我发誓
I'm not gonna let them take you, I promise.

532
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:41,450
我就知道你能保护我免受他们侵害
I knew I could trust you to protect me from them.

533
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:19,980
是不是  我说了吧
Did I tell you, or did I tell you?

534
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,560
这里的食物够吃几星期了
There's enough food here for weeks.

535
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,370
你知道这意味着什么吗
Do you know what this means?

536
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,810
一日三餐都吃奶酪面包吗
Cheese bread three meals a day?

537
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:28,180
还好你对这里的地形了如指掌
Good thing you know your way around this base.

538
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,490
看来对这里了解的不止我一个人
Looks like I'm not the only one.

539
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,310
那是什么
What is it?

540
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,100
是我名字的缩写
It's my initials.

541
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,070
茱莉亚・琳恩・沃克
Julia Lynn Walker.

542
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,740
这也太巧合了吧
Hell of a coincidence.

543
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,000
不  不是巧合
No, it isn't.

544
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,380
不可能的
It can't be.

545
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,140
不可能什么
Can't be what?

546
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,230
这是我的字迹
It's my writing.

547
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:05,670
我就是这么写自己名字的  还有
The way I wrote my name and...

548
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:08,490
画这些夜来香花朵
the flower evening primrose.

549
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,870
我小时候最喜欢它了
It was my favorite when I was a girl.

550
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,160
它们在蒙大拿州随处可见
It grows in Montana.

551
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:16,800
我的笔记本里画满了这个
I have notebooks full of them.

552
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,510
这是我的笔迹
I did this.

553
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,810
我以前来过这
I've been here before.

10554
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:36,860
{\an8}警告  氧气浓度已低至临界值

555
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,550
环境警告
Environmental alert.

556
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,410
环境警告
Environmental alert.

557
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,390
先生们
Gentlemen.

558
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:46,400
我们需要谈谈
We need to have a talk.

559
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:53,540
放下武器  不会用上它们的
Put down the weapons. They won't be necessary.

560
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:56,760
抱歉  不能如你所愿
Forgive us if we don't agree.

561
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:00,100
断绝这个基地的氧气无异于谋杀
Depriving this base of oxygen is murder.

562
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,770
难道把我们关起来
What about locking us up

563
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:04,380
不给补给  放弃治疗就不是谋杀吗
with barely any supplies and no treatment?

564
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,540
这只是暂时的隔离
It is only a temporary quarantine.

565
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,900
或许你该跟我们一起待在下面
Maybe you should stay down here with us.

566
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:16,550
让我们看看什么叫"暂时"
Then we'll see your definition of "Temporary."

567
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,770
你说得没错
You are right.

568
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:20,810
我没有设身处地为你们着想
I'm not standing in your shoes.

569
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:24,340
我不得不做一个艰难的选择
I had to make a hard choice.

570
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:26,900
-你在玩弄我们的生命  -我没有
- You're playing with our lives. - I'm not.

571
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:31,700
-我们的生命同等重要  -你说谎
- Your lives are worth no less than mine. - You're lying.

572
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:36,100
要不我怎么会只带一个人来呢
Why else would I come down here with only one man?

573
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,710
你们完全可以干掉我俩
You could kill us both.

574
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:41,990
如果我们相互斗争  必然死路一条
If we fight... we die.

575
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,090
只有齐心协力
Together...

576
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,960
才能死里逃生
we survive.

577
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:56,640
我们能相信你吗
We have your word?

578
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,730
我以声誉担保
My word of honor.

579
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,370
谢谢
Thank you.

580
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,410
他们就要停手了
They were about to give up.

581
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:15,580
你为什么还...
Why did you...

582
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:17,800
为什么
Why?

583
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:21,820
他们是停手了  可他们没投降
They gave up... but they did not surrender.

584
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:23,630
他们会杀了我们
They were willing to kill us.

585
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,630
-也许不是今天  -但
- Maybe not today. - But--

586
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,490
他们不会善罢甘休的
They would not have stopped.

587
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,840
我们可以把他们关起来
We could have just locked them up.

588
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,940
不到36小时前
You shot an unarmed woman

589
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,140
你杀了一个手无寸铁的女人
less than 36 hours ago.

590
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,190
那是为了保护你
To protect you.

591
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,900
刚才就算还了你的人情
I just returned the favor.

592
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,570
把尸体处理了  上楼去吧
Dispose of the bodies and go back upstairs.

593
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:43,010
你不上去吗
You're not coming?

594
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,410
我还有事要处理
I have something to take care of.

595
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:46,740
沃克博士吗
Dr. Walker?

596
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,590
为何冒这个险
Why take the risk?

597
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,750
我需要你去上面看着
I need you upstairs.

598
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:58,700
就我所知  病毒中携带的遗传信息
As far as I can see, the genetic message inside the virus

599
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:02,760
是大量拼接而成  真正的前沿技术
is a massive splice job - real cutting edge -

600
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,440
源于动物和人类
from animal and human species.

601
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,310
有趣的地方在这里
And here's where it gets interesting.

10602
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,600
{\an8}未知

603
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,930
这有什么有趣的
How is that interesting?

604
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:13,990
因为它全然未知
Because it's completely unknown.

605
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:17,840
它不同于人类已知的任何基因序列
Ran it against every genetic sequence known to man.

606
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,210
这是完全未知的单链
This is a completely unidentified single strand.

607
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:25,440
为什么有人想把它植入人体内
Why would anyone want to put that inside of us?

608
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:28,760
我不知道  但这么做后果极其严重
I don't have a clue, but it scares the crap out of me.

609
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,260
这种病毒能强制将这些信息输入人体内
There's some trait that they want us to manifest,

10610
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:32,150
{\an8}AMH蛋白匹配

611
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,750
从而让我们显现出某些特性
and this disease is a way to force it in.

612
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:39,730
病毒的创造者想从内到外
The people who designed this virus want to change us

613
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,160
彻底地改变我们
from the inside out.

614
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:45,418
我也许并不完美
I mean, I may not be perfect,

615
00:40:45,419 --> 00:40:47,530
但我喜欢我原本的样子
but... I like what I am.

616
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,690
我也喜欢这样的你  朵琳 
I like you too, Doreen.

617
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,840
至少我们还没被感染
Well, we're not infected yet.

618
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,400
我们把这个报告给艾伦
We'll take this to Alan,

619
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,280
查清真相
get to the bottom of it,

620
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,370
在幕后黑手造成实质伤害前
 stop whoever's doing this

621
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:04,880
及时阻止他们
before they cause any real damage.

622
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:08,470
你怎么了
Hey, what's wrong?

623
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,520
能发现这一切多亏了你
This was your idea to begin with.

624
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,960
你是对的
You were right.

625
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,140
是啊
I know.

626
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:26,380
抱歉  朵琳  非常抱歉
Sorry, Doreen. I'm so sorry.

1
00:00:01,157 --> 00:00:02,657
《双螺旋》前情提要
Previously on Helix...

2
00:00:04,737 --> 00:00:05,907
他要不行了
He's crashing!

3
00:00:06,557 --> 00:00:09,487
那是他前妻吗  他从未说起过她或者他弟弟
That's his ex-wife? He never talks about her or his brother.

4
00:00:09,487 --> 00:00:10,747
他没说的原因很可能是因为
That's probably because

5
00:00:10,747 --> 00:00:12,857
他曾将前妻和弟弟捉奸在床
he caught her and his brother in bed together.

6
00:00:16,257 --> 00:00:17,257
这是我的笔迹
I did this.

7
00:00:18,217 --> 00:00:19,537
我以前来过这
I've been here before.

8
00:00:19,707 --> 00:00:21,547
-你测试结果呈阴性  -你确定吗
- You tested negative. - Are you really sure?

9
00:00:22,677 --> 00:00:24,467
我不能让你留在这里  你病了
I can't keep you here. You're sick.

10
00:00:24,687 --> 00:00:25,987
我不是唯一有病的人
I'm not the only one.

11
00:00:27,267 --> 00:00:28,837
你什么时候知道自己长了肿瘤的
How long have you known about your tumor?

12
00:00:32,387 --> 00:00:35,117
病毒的创造者想从内到外
The people who designed this virus want to change us,

13
00:00:35,257 --> 00:00:36,487
彻底地改变我们
from the inside out.

00:00:41,717 --> 00:00:47,407
{\an8}第五日

10015
00:01:28,787 --> 00:01:32,867
{\an8}情报收集任务完成
请求撤离

10016
00:01:34,357 --> 00:01:35,237
{\an8}信息已发送
等待回复

10017
00:01:38,287 --> 00:01:41,087
{\an8}撤离搁置
视位置及威特博士获救情况而定
信息结束

10018
00:01:43,007 --> 00:01:44,577
{\an8}请详细说明

10019
00:01:45,407 --> 00:01:46,807
{\an8}信息已发送
等待回复

10020
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:48,637
{\an8}带回威特博士
信息结束

10021
00:01:50,517 --> 00:01:52,837
{\an8}带回威特博士
信息结束

22
00:01:51,057 --> 00:01:52,757
威特博士是谁
Who the hell is Dr. Hvit?

23
00:02:26,407 --> 00:02:28,267
法拉格特博士  你要见我是吗
Dr. Farragut, you wanted to see me?

24
00:02:28,687 --> 00:02:30,017
是的  想让你看点东西
Yeah, I want to show you something.

25
00:02:30,447 --> 00:02:34,187
-是彼得病情反复了吗  -不  他情况还那样
- Is it Peter? - No. His status is unchanged.

26
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:35,727
还是没有大脑活动
Still no brain activity.

27
00:02:37,187 --> 00:02:38,287
来看这个
Have a look at this.

28
00:02:38,747 --> 00:02:40,317
我用你的治疗方案
I used your protocols and

29
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,927
以及我正在试验的改良化合物
a modified compound I've been experimenting with.

30
00:02:43,407 --> 00:02:45,237
在这两处结合位点
I substituted multiple residues

31
00:02:45,237 --> 00:02:46,797
用多样残留物代替
at these two binding sites,

32
00:02:46,797 --> 00:02:48,947
在这里加了四氢呋喃氨基甲酸酯
added a tetrahydrofuran carbamate here,

33
00:02:49,207 --> 00:02:52,137
在这里加了三嗪环  以减少硬脂交互作用
a triazine ring here, all to reduce stearic interaction.

34
00:02:52,727 --> 00:02:55,557
这样就可以延缓病毒攻破索迪拉
And that's taking the virus longer to break the SODRAs down.

35
00:02:56,347 --> 00:02:57,747
但终究还是抵御不了
But it still does in the end.

36
00:02:58,577 --> 00:03:00,597
我在培养菌中能做到的只有这样了
I've taken this as far as I can in culture.

37
00:03:00,757 --> 00:03:02,607
我得看看它在活组织中的反应
I need to see how it reacts in living tissue.

38
00:03:02,607 --> 00:03:04,097
我可以马上开始动物实验
I can start animal studies to test efficacy

39
00:03:04,097 --> 00:03:05,627
以验证其疗效和安全性
and safety right away.

40
00:03:05,787 --> 00:03:07,497
-24小时内就能出结果  -我希望这个试验
- We could have results in 24 hours-- - I'd like to bring

41
00:03:07,497 --> 00:03:10,887
能让我队伍里的兽医病理学家朵琳・博伊尔参与
my veterinary pathologist, Doreen Boyle, up to speed on this.

42
00:03:10,887 --> 00:03:12,107
她应该能帮不少忙
I think she could be a big help.

43
00:03:12,107 --> 00:03:14,742
艾伦  这是一大突破
Alan, this is progress.

44
00:03:14,743 --> 00:03:16,747
还得先在老鼠身上看看是否有效
It has to work in the rats first.

45
00:03:16,747 --> 00:03:18,747
-如果有效呢  -如果有效
- And if it does? - If it does,

46
00:03:19,297 --> 00:03:20,987
x宏就没有借口了
Hatake won't have any more excuses.

47
00:03:20,987 --> 00:03:22,497
我们就能解除R层的封锁
We'll reopen Level R,

48
00:03:22,497 --> 00:03:25,357
开始在茱莉亚和其他受感染的病患身上试验
start testing Julia and the rest of the infected patients.

49
00:03:26,797 --> 00:03:29,987
法拉格特博士  我让你准点报备的
Dr. Farragut. I asked you to check in on the hour.

50
00:03:29,987 --> 00:03:32,387
不受干扰的研究才能尽快取得成果
Uninterrupted research is how we get results.

51
00:03:32,387 --> 00:03:34,157
x宏有意见的话
If Hatake has a problem with that,

52
00:03:34,157 --> 00:03:36,737
你让他自己来跟我说
he can talk to me himself - for whatever that's worth.

53
00:03:36,737 --> 00:03:38,087
他让我全权负责这里  他正在...
He's left me in charge while he takes care--

54
00:03:38,087 --> 00:03:40,487
他在处理"基地事宜"  谁信啊
While he conducts "base business". Right.

55
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:52,257
别人会听到的
Someone might hear you.

56
00:03:52,257 --> 00:03:54,677
-好痛  -我知道  但你得小声点
- It hurts. - I know, but you have to stay quiet.

57
00:03:54,677 --> 00:03:56,597
要是被他们发现  你就得去R层了
If they find you, they'll take you back to Level R.

58
00:03:57,427 --> 00:03:58,987
我得回实验室工作了
I have to get back to my lab work.

59
00:03:59,117 --> 00:04:01,677
我会尽快拿些吗啡回来
I'll try and get back as soon as I can with more morphine.

60
00:04:05,087 --> 00:04:06,847
热乎乎的巧克力布朗尼蛋糕
Warm, gooey chocolate brownies.

61
00:04:08,297 --> 00:04:10,627
威斯康星大学一项研究表明
A study at the University of Wisconsin showed that

62
00:04:10,627 --> 00:04:13,757
想象可口的食物有助减轻疼痛
fantasizing about delicious food can help minimize pain.

63
00:04:13,927 --> 00:04:15,347
布朗尼蛋糕是我的最爱
Brownies are my go-to.

64
00:04:16,427 --> 00:04:17,527
纸杯蛋糕
Cupcakes.

65
00:04:18,267 --> 00:04:19,117
很好
That's good.

66
00:04:20,897 --> 00:04:22,747
什么样的  越详细越好
What kind? The more specific, the better.

67
00:04:25,947 --> 00:04:27,957
红丝绒奶油干酪糖霜蛋糕
Red velvet, cream cheese icing.

68
00:04:28,637 --> 00:04:29,967
而且不是松松垮垮的那种
And none of that flaky cake.

69
00:04:29,967 --> 00:04:31,397
我喜欢紧实的
I like it dense.

70
00:04:35,017 --> 00:04:36,237
好受些了吗
Did it help?

71
00:04:36,867 --> 00:04:37,867
好点了
A little...

72
00:04:39,797 --> 00:04:41,017
但把我馋虫勾起来了
But now I'm hungry.

73
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:51,917
等待是最折磨人的部分
The worst part is the waiting.

74
00:04:54,067 --> 00:04:55,477
死亡不知何时就会突然降临
Death should come out of nowhere.

75
00:04:55,477 --> 00:04:57,307
而你却能够坦然面对
You shouldn't have to stare it in the face.

76
00:04:59,937 --> 00:05:01,047
你怎么做到的
How do you do it,

77
00:05:01,687 --> 00:05:03,607
明知难逃一死却还能坚持生活
knowing you're just waiting to die?

78
00:05:05,797 --> 00:05:07,367
人人都难逃一死
We're all waiting to die,

79
00:05:08,847 --> 00:05:10,147
只不过我的时间更少一点而已
I just have a little less time.

10080
00:05:16,777 --> 00:05:18,497
员工数据库检索模块
搜索姓名  威特

10081
00:05:21,957 --> 00:05:23,707
无结果

82
00:05:27,517 --> 00:05:29,017
你在这干什么
What the hell are you doing?

83
00:05:33,997 --> 00:05:35,157
坐这挺惬意啊
It's comfy.

84
00:05:36,117 --> 00:05:37,417
不许坐他的座位
Get out of his chair.

85
00:05:37,857 --> 00:05:40,117
好  威特博士在哪
Sure. Where's Dr. Hvit?

86
00:05:40,857 --> 00:05:43,097
-谁  -威特博士
- Who? - Dr. Hvit.

87
00:05:43,097 --> 00:05:45,687
我想和他或者她谈谈  现在就谈
I need to speak to him, or her, right away.

88
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:48,127
基地里没有这号人物
There's no one on this base by the name of Dr. Hvit.

89
00:05:48,287 --> 00:05:50,347
马上离开他的座位
Now get out of his chair.

90
00:05:55,727 --> 00:05:57,077
你还真是尽忠职守啊
He's got you well trained.

91
00:05:57,747 --> 00:05:58,647
你说什么
Excuse me?

92
00:05:59,037 --> 00:06:01,157
他给了你多少好处让你这般忠心耿耿
How much is he paying you to inspire such loyalty?

93
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:03,777
-我不听命于他  -是啊
- I don't work for him. - That's right.

94
00:06:03,917 --> 00:06:06,507
他收养了你  你就像他的儿子
He adopted you. You're like a son to him.

95
00:06:06,507 --> 00:06:07,597
我就是他的儿子
I am his son.

96
00:06:07,597 --> 00:06:09,907
你知不知道  在里约热内卢的贫民窟
You know, in the favelas in Rio,

97
00:06:09,907 --> 00:06:12,207
那里的帮派都自称为家族
the gangs, they call themselves a familia.

98
00:06:12,567 --> 00:06:14,417
也就是家庭的意思  而且他们有个说法
Family. And they have a saying:

99
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,247
"忠以血  叛以血"
"Blood in, blood out."

100
00:06:17,817 --> 00:06:20,277
他们找来这些九岁十岁的小男孩
They'd find these little boys, nine, 10 years old,

101
00:06:20,657 --> 00:06:23,657
让他们行凶杀人  以此将他们收入帮派
and they'd make them murder people to bond them to the gang,

102
00:06:24,347 --> 00:06:25,467
以血献忠
blood in.

103
00:06:25,867 --> 00:06:28,237
而这些男孩陷得如此之深  全然不知
And these boys, they'd go so deep, they'd have no idea

104
00:06:28,237 --> 00:06:30,707
他们只是马前卒子  随时会被牺牲掉
that they were grunts, that they were expendable.

105
00:06:32,427 --> 00:06:33,687
而如果他们胆敢抗命
And if they disobeyed,

106
00:06:34,257 --> 00:06:35,837
或者试图脱离帮派
or tried to leave the gang...

107
00:06:39,827 --> 00:06:40,917
以血惩叛
...blood out.

108
00:06:42,187 --> 00:06:45,207
鬼知道x宏正在R层干什么勾当
Hatake's down on Level R, doing God knows what.

109
00:06:45,337 --> 00:06:47,587
你真以为他让你负责是信任你
You think he left you in charge because he trusts you,

110
00:06:48,657 --> 00:06:50,227
还是他想转移你的注意力
or because he's trying to distract you?

111
00:06:52,367 --> 00:06:54,167
我需要你立马滚出这间办公室
You need to get out of this office.

112
00:06:55,317 --> 00:06:56,297
现在就滚
Now.

10113
00:07:24,227 --> 00:07:32,907
双螺旋

114
00:07:37,427 --> 00:07:39,277
求你开门吧  我们有吃的
Please. We have food.

115
00:07:39,977 --> 00:07:42,037
数量很多  足够大家分了
There's plenty here. We can all share.

116
00:07:43,607 --> 00:07:44,677
你被感染了吧
Are you sick?

117
00:07:44,687 --> 00:07:47,917
-快滚远点  -你这是浪费时间
- Get the hell away from here! - This is a waste of time.

118
00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:48,947
我们不能就这么站在走廊上
We should get out of the hallway.

119
00:07:48,947 --> 00:07:50,837
我们得把这层的人组织起来
We have to organize the people down here.

120
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,167
这样活下去的机会才更大些
It's a better chance of survival.

121
00:07:53,237 --> 00:07:55,067
能说说你不想回那间房的真正原因吗
Can we talk about the reason you don't want to go back?

122
00:07:56,037 --> 00:07:58,177
-是什么  -因为墙上的姓名缩写
- What's that? - The initials on the wall.

123
00:07:58,337 --> 00:07:59,977
-你的姓名缩写  -那不是我的姓名缩写
- Your initials. - They weren't my initials.

124
00:07:59,977 --> 00:08:00,987
我从未来过这
I've never been here before.

125
00:08:01,137 --> 00:08:02,577
可你的笔迹又怎么解释
So how do you explain that it was your handwriting?

126
00:08:02,987 --> 00:08:05,117
被感染的征状之一就是出现幻觉
Hallucinations are one of the symptoms of the infection.

127
00:08:05,647 --> 00:08:07,347
得了吧  我也看见那些字了
Nice try, but I saw them too.

128
00:08:07,677 --> 00:08:09,897
会不会是你小时候来过这
Is it possible you were here when you were younger?

129
00:08:11,817 --> 00:08:12,677
是啊  肯定是我忘记了
Yeah, I must have forgotten

130
00:08:12,677 --> 00:08:15,017
我全家来这冰天雪地的北极圈度假过好几次
all those family vacations to the Arctic Circle.

131
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:18,237
我在蒙大拿州长大
I grew up in Montana.

132
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:20,957
小时候去过最远的地方就是波兹曼市
The most exotic place I ever went as a kid was Bozeman.

133
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:21,227
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}蒙大拿州地广人稀
波兹曼市为该州第四大城市  人口约四万人

134
00:08:22,057 --> 00:08:22,837
茱尔斯
Jules.

135
00:08:24,867 --> 00:08:25,867
你刚才叫我什么
What did you just call me?

136
00:08:27,437 --> 00:08:29,547
如果你不喜欢的话  我就不那么叫
If you don't like it, I won't call you that.

137
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:31,747
也不是  只是...
No, it's just, uh...

138
00:08:32,647 --> 00:08:35,027
只有我妈和艾伦这么叫我
Alan and my mother were the only ones who ever called me that.

139
00:08:41,177 --> 00:08:43,917
求你...救救我
Help... please.

140
00:09:08,987 --> 00:09:09,947
朵琳
Doreen!

141
00:09:11,647 --> 00:09:13,727
天哪  撑住
Jesus. Hold on.

142
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,790
我的天哪
Oh, my god.

143
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:28,810
发生了什么
What happened?

144
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,990
-她被带菌者袭击了吗  -是老鼠
- Was... was she attacked by a vector? - It was the rats.

145
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,300
老鼠吗  老鼠这么会跑出来
The rats? How did they get out?

146
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,540
笼子被掀翻到她的身上
The cages were turned over on her.

147
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,180
可能她突发心脏病什么的
Maybe she had some kind of heart attack,

148
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,010
抓住了架子  倒下的时候掀翻了
grabbed the rack, and it went down when she did.

149
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,500
或者是有人推翻的
Or someone pushed it.

150
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,520
你认为有人故意为之吗
You think someone did this on purpose?

151
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,430
外勤人员每年都有体检
We have annual physicals for field duty.

152
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:53,570
如果朵琳真有心脏不适的征兆
If Doreen had any hint of cardiac distress,

153
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,750
她不会获准参与这次调查的
she'd never have been permitted to join this investigation.

154
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,400
海拔对体能影响有个体差异
Altitude changes effect individuals differently.

155
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,980
而且昨天二氧化碳净化器关闭了四个小时
And the CO2 scrubbers were turned off for four hours yesterday.

156
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,970
在我看来她身体状况很好
Seems like she was in pretty good health to me.

157
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,060
法拉格特博士  你知道
Do you know how many murders

158
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,090
这座基地发生过几起谋杀吗
have occurred at this base, Dr. Farragut?

159
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,350
从未有过
Zero.

160
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,190
但意外情况却经常发生
Accidents, however, happen all the time-

161
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,580
这他妈根本不是意外
This wasn't a goddamn accident!

162
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,310
-除非有证据证明是人为  -证据
- Until the evidence suggests otherwise-- - Evidence?

163
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,830
我们身处荒芜  与世隔绝
We're in the ass-end of nowhere, cut off from the world.

164
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:22,650
我的得力助手困在R层  生命堪忧
My best doctor is trapped and dying somewhere below us,

165
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,694
而我在疾控中心的最好朋友
and my closest friend from the CDC

166
00:10:24,695 --> 00:10:26,540
很有可能刚被人谋杀
has very likely just been murdered.

167
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,080
这地方...简直就是个随时引爆的定时炸弹
This place is a... it's a time bomb waiting to go off,

168
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,150
而我们还在假装
and we're pretending this

169
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,130
企盼着这些垃圾会救我们一命
these goddamn things are gonna save us!

170
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,520
我想目前我们最大的麻烦不是病毒
Right now, I'm thinking the virus is not our biggest problem.

171
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,390
-我马上去查看监控录像  -不行
- I'll review the surveillance footage immediately. - No.

172
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:54,530
你不能一个人去  莎拉  去找杜尚博士
Not alone you won't. Sarah, find Dr. Duchamp.

173
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,300
让他马上用索迪拉进行动物试验
Tell him to start the animal trials with the SODRA immediately.

174
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,050
一旦出现并发症马上通知我
You find me if there are complications.

175
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,070
我告诉他们只要把氧气净化器打开
I said we would bring food and water

176
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:10,690
我就给他们送食物和水
if they turned the oxygen scrubbers back on,

177
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,800
但他们却袭击我
but they attacked me.

178
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,480
出血减缓了  但伤口还是需要缝合
The bleeding is slowing, but you're gonna need stitches.

179
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,520
我们得送你去用作分诊室的那间实验室
We need to get you to that lab we set up for triage.

180
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,000
那可是在基地的另一侧啊
That's on the other side of the facility.

181
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,540
我们没办法一路把他拖去那儿
We can't drag him all the way over there.

182
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,930
-为什么不能  -你在跟谁讲话
- Why not? - What was that?

183
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,270
x博士  这是杰伊  杰伊  这是x博士
Dr. Hatake, this is Jaye. Jaye, Hatake.

184
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,860
-杰伊  -别装做不认识我
- Jaye? - Don't pretend like you don't know who I am.

185
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,650
我也不想假装帮你
And I won't pretend I'm gonna help you

186
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,800
当初可是你把我们锁在这儿自生自灭的
after you locked us down here to fend for ourselves.

187
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,510
-确实是你封锁了这儿  -我别无他法
- You did seal us up down here. - I had no choice.

188
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:42,130
我们不能让传染病扩散
We could not allow the infection to spread.

189
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,140
我们得送你去那间实验室  把伤口缝起来
We need to get you to that lab, close up this wound.

190
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,350
太危险了  我们根本到不了那
It's too dangerous. We'd never make it.

191
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,720
有别的方法穿越这一楼层吗
Is there any other way across this level?

192
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,660
有个维修隧道
An access tunnel.

193
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:54,010
一直通向基地的另一边
It goes all the way to the other side of the base.

194
00:11:54,580 --> 00:12:00,480
但我不会求你...用你的生命冒险救我的
But I would not ask you to... risk your life for mine.

195
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,960
你不需要求我
You don't have to ask.

196
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,020
你需要帮助  我就会帮你
You need my help, I'm gonna help you.

197
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,830
我们来尝试确定事件发生的时间
Let's narrow the window of incident.

198
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,250
你最后一次见到博伊尔博士是什么时候
When was the last time you saw Dr. Boyle?

199
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,260
大概是昨天早上9点
About 9am yesterday morning.

200
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,130
她已经有十小时没和你汇报了吗
In 10 hours, you didn't check in with her?

201
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,460
当时我在弟弟身上进行索迪拉的实验
I was running SODRA trials on my brother.

202
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,970
并且她能力足以自理  不需要时时向我汇报
And she was capable; she didn't need to check in.

203
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,280
是啊  "不受干扰的研究"
Right. "Uninterrupted research."

204
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,360
怎么回事
What happened there?

205
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,390
文件损坏了
The file's been corrupted.

206
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,880
我查查备份
I'll check the backup.

207
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,740
不可能啊  备份也被删除了
That's impossible. The backups have been deleted too.

208
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,380
唯一有权限这么做的只有我和
The only ones with access are me and--

209
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,930
x宏  恰巧消失了的那位
Hatake, who's conveniently disappeared.

210
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:04,090
我们俩都和这事无关
Neither of us have anything to do with this.

211
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,330
我会查出博伊尔博士身上到底发生了什么
I will find out what happened to Dr. Boyle.

212
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,600
我会通过验尸来自己找出答案
I'll find out myself through an autopsy.

213
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,220
杜尚博士
Dr. Duchamp?

214
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,460
我是拜耶塞罗少校
I'm Major Balleseros.

215
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,260
又要新一轮的检查吗
Is this another check-in?

216
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,500
我没有受感染的迹象
I'm showing no signs of infection.

217
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,200
不是
No.

218
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,830
我是来找威特博士的
I'm looking for a Dr. Hvit.

219
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,670
这名字我有段时间没听过了
That's a name I haven't heard in a while.

220
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,380
我查看研究资料的时候
I was going through the research files,

221
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,250
发现你们曾合作过一篇论文
and I saw that you two did a paper together.

222
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,700
那是很多年前的事了
That was many years ago.

223
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,410
-你是说他现在离开基地了吗  -不  他在
- So he's no longer on the base? - Oh, no, he is.

224
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,760
只是没人再见过他了
It's just, no one ever sees him anymore.

225
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:08,550
我听说他得了一种少见的免疫缺陷症
I hear he developed a rare immune deficiency.

226
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,680
不能再轻易和别人接触
He can no longer interact with people.

227
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,850
他的存在几乎成了这里的一个传说
He's become somewhat of an urban legend.

228
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,030
据说他现在住在白色房间里
I heard rumors he's in the white room.

229
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,620
白色房间在哪里呢
Where can I find that?

230
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,470
我们都在白色房间里
We are all in the white room.

231
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,920
不好意思  我想和少校谈谈
Excuse me. I need to speak with the major.

232
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,500
是不是你杀了疾控中心的兽医
Did you kill the CDC vet?

233
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,530
我好像不记得了
You'd think I'd remember that.

234
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,910
是你干的吗
Did you do it?

235
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,080
监控录像怎么说的
What did the surveillance video show?

236
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,230
x宏知道吗
Did Hatake know?

237
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,810
问他去  他不是什么都和你说吗
Ask him. He tells you everything, right?

238
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,370
法拉格特博士正在进行尸检
Dr. Farragut is running an autopsy as we speak.

239
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,950
你最好祈祷自己没留下什么蛛丝马迹
You better hope you covered your tracks.

240
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:07,810
行动代码852  D层  血液科
Code 852, level D, Hematology.

241
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:12,660
请注意  行动代码852  D层  血液科
Attention: Code 852, level D, Hematology.

242
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,570
请注意  行动代码852  D层  血液科
Attention: Code 852, level D, Hematology.

243
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:31,550
范・艾根医生
Dr. Van Eigem?

244
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,110
糟了
Shit.

245
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,050
范・艾根医生  你在干什么
Dr. Van Eigem, what are you doing?

246
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,810
我在为托尼跳舞
I'm dancing for Tony.

247
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,140
可托尼不在这里
Tony isn't here.

248
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,280
他当然在这
Of course he is.

249
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,450
怎么了
What's wrong?

250
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,180
发生了什么
What happened?

251
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,950
我无法控制自己
I couldn't stop myself.

252
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,720
我要变成那些怪物了  对吗
I'm gonna turn into one of those things, aren't I?

253
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,800
我们先回屋里去吧
We need to get you back to the room.

254
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,170
来吧
Come on.

255
00:16:56,122 --> 00:16:57,462
还有多远
How long is it?

256
00:16:57,952 --> 00:16:59,362
四十米
Forty meters.

257
00:16:59,882 --> 00:17:00,872
我建议咱们绕路走
I vote we go around.

258
00:17:00,882 --> 00:17:02,532
谁知道里边等着我们的是什么
Who knows what's waiting for us in there?

259
00:17:02,532 --> 00:17:03,982
我们没时间了
We don't have time.

260
00:17:10,282 --> 00:17:11,732
好吧  我们走
All right, let's go.

261
00:17:20,652 --> 00:17:22,262
我们踩的这些是什么
What are we stepping on?

262
00:17:22,682 --> 00:17:24,082
看起来像是玻璃
Looks like glass.

263
00:17:24,182 --> 00:17:27,562
有人把灯打破了  估计是想躲起来
Someone busted the lights out. Probably trying to hide.

264
00:17:27,882 --> 00:17:31,822
或是  制造陷阱
Or... Setting a trap.

265
00:17:51,422 --> 00:17:52,652
找到什么了吗
Found anything?

266
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:54,792
她死于一种栓塞
She died of an embolism.

267
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:58,542
扫描显示她的左脑有一处瘀伤
A scan revealed bruising in the left hemisphere of her brain,

268
00:17:58,542 --> 00:18:00,242
与气泡一致
Consistent with an air bubble.

269
00:18:01,232 --> 00:18:03,042
这么说是自然死亡
So it was natural causes.

270
00:18:03,222 --> 00:18:06,092
可为什么有人要故意删除监视录像
Why would anyone have erased the security footage?

271
00:18:07,262 --> 00:18:10,572
-你昨天见过朵琳吗  -碰到了一面
- Did you see Doreen yesterday? - Just in passing.

272
00:18:10,572 --> 00:18:13,582
关于研究她有提起过什么吗
Did she say anything? About her research?

273
00:18:13,582 --> 00:18:14,742
有什么突破吗
Any breakthrough she might've had?

274
00:18:14,742 --> 00:18:16,732
没  她什么都没说
No, she didn't.

275
00:18:21,112 --> 00:18:22,382
我对朵琳了解的不多
I didn't know Doreen too well,

276
00:18:22,382 --> 00:18:24,882
不过她看上去是一个很好的队友
but she seemed like a good person to have on your team.

277
00:18:25,192 --> 00:18:29,382
我认识她15年了  她不应该遭受这些的
I knew her 15 years. She didn't deserve this.

278
00:18:33,872 --> 00:18:35,262
她有家人吗
Did she have any family?

279
00:18:36,002 --> 00:18:37,510
第三段婚姻里有一个儿子
A son from her third marriage.

280
00:18:37,511 --> 00:18:39,222
把那瓶酒精递给我
Hand me that bottle of alcohol.

281
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:57,882
-那是什么  -针孔
- What is that? - Puncture mark

282
00:18:58,712 --> 00:18:59,992
注射器针孔
from a needle.

10283
00:19:03,678 --> 00:19:04,720
{\an8}吗啡

284
00:19:06,322 --> 00:19:08,932
我不想变得像那些怪物一样
I don't want to become one of those things.

285
00:19:09,112 --> 00:19:10,382
我明白
I know.

286
00:19:10,812 --> 00:19:12,332
阻止我
Don't let me.

287
00:19:13,842 --> 00:19:15,722
你知道我是什么意思
You know what I'm asking.

288
00:19:20,132 --> 00:19:21,332
你生病了
You're sick.

289
00:19:21,682 --> 00:19:23,452
你只是吃了药在胡言乱语
It's the drugs talking.

290
00:19:24,852 --> 00:19:28,102
在我看见托尼的幻觉之前
I was on my way to the drug stockroom

291
00:19:29,112 --> 00:19:30,582
我已经准备
before...

292
00:19:31,752 --> 00:19:33,522
去药库自行了断
I saw Tony.

293
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,322
可我自己下不了手
I can't do it myself.

294
00:19:40,822 --> 00:19:42,112
求求你了
Please.

295
00:19:43,212 --> 00:19:44,422
求求你
Please.

296
00:20:12,902 --> 00:20:14,152
莎拉
Sarah?

297
00:20:14,532 --> 00:20:15,922
莎拉  我是艾伦
Sarah, it's Alan.

298
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:25,022
-你在里面没事吧  -马上来
- You all right in there? - One minute.

299
00:20:32,162 --> 00:20:34,812
抱歉  我刚才在换衣服
Hey. Sorry, I was just getting changed.

300
00:20:34,912 --> 00:20:35,992
有什么事吗
What's going on?

301
00:20:35,992 --> 00:20:38,862
尸检证明  朵琳是被谋杀的
Doreen was murdered. The autopsy proves it.

302
00:20:39,512 --> 00:20:41,622
-用什么方法  -有人给她打了空气针
- How? - Somebody used a syringe

303
00:20:41,622 --> 00:20:43,752
使她看起来像得了栓塞
to make it look like she had an embolism.

304
00:20:43,852 --> 00:20:45,712
他们手法很娴熟
They knew what they were doing.

305
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:47,392
我们一定要多加小心
We need to be careful.

306
00:20:47,432 --> 00:20:50,552
-你还好吗  -是的  我
- Are you ok? - Yeah. I'm...

307
00:20:51,202 --> 00:20:52,542
我
I, uh...

308
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:55,752
我  我真不知道这里到底怎么了
I... I just don't know what's going on here.

309
00:20:55,752 --> 00:20:59,452
沃克被感染了  朵琳死了
I mean... Walker's sick. Doreen's dead.

310
00:20:59,452 --> 00:21:03,202
现在你又告诉我她是被谋杀的
You're telling me that somebody murdered her. I...

311
00:21:03,202 --> 00:21:04,902
我们真的能活着走出这里吗
Are we even gonna make it out of this place alive?

312
00:21:04,902 --> 00:21:08,282
会没事的
It's ok.

313
00:21:08,502 --> 00:21:09,772
会没事的
It's ok.

314
00:21:11,642 --> 00:21:13,372
我不会让你有事的
I won't let anything happen to you.

315
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:15,692
好吗
All right?

316
00:21:24,222 --> 00:21:26,352
-莎拉  我...  -对不起
- Sarah, I... - I'm sorry.

317
00:21:26,522 --> 00:21:28,092
我  我不该吻你
I... I shouldn't have done that.

318
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:31,112
你嗑药了吗
Are you high?

319
00:21:32,122 --> 00:21:33,322
你说什么
What?

320
00:21:33,402 --> 00:21:35,852
我几乎看不到你的瞳孔了  你吃了什么药
I can barely see your pupils. What are you on?

321
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:38,272
我有点偏头痛  所以吃了点止疼药
I had a migraine, so I took something.

322
00:21:38,272 --> 00:21:41,392
-什么止疼药  -加巴喷丁
- What? - Gabapentin.

323
00:21:41,542 --> 00:21:43,762
别骗我  除非你把整瓶都吃了
You're lying, unless you took the whole bottle.

324
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:45,582
-艾伦  等等  你听我解释  -不
- Alan, wait. I... I can expl-- - No,

325
00:21:45,582 --> 00:21:47,602
这种事情没有借口  从来都没有
there's no excuse for this, ever!

326
00:21:47,602 --> 00:21:48,632
这里的人们命悬一线
People's lives are at stake;

327
00:21:48,632 --> 00:21:50,002
他们都指望着我们呢
they're depending on us!

328
00:21:50,002 --> 00:21:51,232
你这样的状态根本没法工作
You're of no use to me like this!

329
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:51,892
但是  我
But I--

330
00:21:51,892 --> 00:21:53,752
别说了  你去睡一觉清醒一下
No, you go sleep this off.

331
00:21:53,752 --> 00:21:55,342
我们回头再处理这件事
We'll deal with it later.

332
00:22:14,712 --> 00:22:17,972
对不起  我们能歇一会吗
I'm sorry... Can we take a moment?

333
00:22:17,972 --> 00:22:19,752
不  我们不能停
No, not really.

334
00:22:23,602 --> 00:22:25,432
让我检查一下你的伤口
Let me take a look at your wound.

335
00:22:31,822 --> 00:22:34,182
伤口需要压力止血  得把它绑起来
We need to tie something around you for more pressure.

336
00:22:35,202 --> 00:22:37,332
给  用这个
Here, use this.

337
00:22:38,112 --> 00:22:38,962
快一点
And hurry up.

338
00:22:38,962 --> 00:22:42,372
把你的身体往前倾
Ok, I'm gonna need you to lean forward for me.

339
00:22:58,252 --> 00:22:59,562
什么声音
What was that?

340
00:23:02,802 --> 00:23:04,542
天啊  是老鼠
Oh, my god. Rats!

341
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:09,182
-它们从哪来的  -更重要的是
- Where are they coming from? - The more important question is:

342
00:23:09,452 --> 00:23:11,252
它们在躲避什么
What are they running from?

343
00:23:16,882 --> 00:23:18,172
快跑
Run!

344
00:23:29,922 --> 00:23:31,192
这里有门
The door!

345
00:23:31,332 --> 00:23:32,692
到门这里来
Get to the door!

346
00:23:39,652 --> 00:23:41,812
杰伊呢  她刚刚还在我身后
Where's Jaye? She was right behind me.

347
00:23:41,812 --> 00:23:44,502
-我没看到她  -我们得回去
- I didn't see her. - We have to go back!

348
00:23:45,032 --> 00:23:46,512
太迟了
It's too late.

349
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:01,998
我们到底在找什么
What exactly are we looking for?

350
00:24:02,878 --> 00:24:05,278
朵琳遗留下来的任何研究成果
Anything salvageable of Doreen's research.

351
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:08,308
还有她死前发现的线索
Any clue as to what she might have discovered before she...

352
00:24:10,538 --> 00:24:12,248
你是说有人想掩盖真相
You think there's some kind of cover-up?

353
00:24:12,838 --> 00:24:14,668
除了这个原因还有什么
Why else would anyone kill her?

354
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,378
转基因实验室
The transgenics lab.

355
00:24:20,768 --> 00:24:21,408
那里怎么了
What about it?

356
00:24:21,408 --> 00:24:22,348
就是发现猴子的实验室
That lab where they found the monkey.

357
00:24:22,348 --> 00:24:24,008
她还没来得及采集样本
It was totally cleaned out before she had a chance

358
00:24:24,008 --> 00:24:25,648
那里就被彻底清理了
to gather any samples.

359
00:24:25,678 --> 00:24:28,708
-她没告诉你吗  -没有
- She didn't tell you? - No, she didn't.

360
00:24:28,938 --> 00:24:30,168
从上到下消毒了个遍
Sanitized from top to bottom.

361
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:31,648
我想肯定是x宏下的命令
Figured Hatake must have ordered it.

362
00:24:31,648 --> 00:24:32,478
如果那里被清理了
If it was cleaned out,

363
00:24:32,478 --> 00:24:34,888
她又是从哪里拿到猴子标本做分析的呢
where'd she get the monkey sample she was analyzing?

364
00:24:34,888 --> 00:24:37,178
也许这里的某位科学家在帮助她
Maybe some of the scientists from here were helping her.

365
00:24:38,588 --> 00:24:42,728
这么说起来  她确实提到过一个名字
Come to think of it, she did mention a name:

366
00:24:42,728 --> 00:24:44,198
威特博士
Dr... Hvit?

367
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,318
她从没跟我提过这个名字
She never mentioned him to me.

368
00:24:47,658 --> 00:24:49,968
那就怪了  朵琳说她曾找过他
That's strange. She said she spoke to him.

369
00:24:49,968 --> 00:24:52,148
还说他似乎知道所有问题的答案
Said he seemed to have all the answers.

370
00:24:55,098 --> 00:24:57,688
我去找找这个威特博士
Well, I will find this Dr. Hvit and...

371
00:24:58,178 --> 00:25:00,778
看看他能否对现在的情况作出解释
see if he can shed any light on the situation.

372
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,358
我不认识什么威特博士
I don't know a Dr. Hvit.

373
00:25:11,358 --> 00:25:12,958
朵琳和他谈过
Doreen talked to him.

374
00:25:13,548 --> 00:25:16,578
她和他谈过  朵琳亲口告诉你的
She... talked to him? Doreen told you that?

375
00:25:16,578 --> 00:25:18,728
不是  拜耶塞罗少校说的
No, Major Balleseros did.

376
00:25:19,538 --> 00:25:22,028
拜耶塞罗少校还告诉我
Major Balleseros also told me

377
00:25:22,028 --> 00:25:24,478
他们发现转基因实验室被清理了
how they found the transgenics lab cleaned out.

378
00:25:24,478 --> 00:25:26,198
但我想你对此也一定毫不知情吧
But I guess you know nothing about that either.

379
00:25:26,198 --> 00:25:28,278
那只是常规的卫生消毒程序
That was a routine sanitization procedure.

380
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:29,768
胡说  那是为了掩盖真相
Bullshit, that was a cover-up.

381
00:25:29,768 --> 00:25:31,888
我们既然请你们来研究病毒
Why would we want to cover up a virus

382
00:25:31,888 --> 00:25:33,948
为什么还要隐瞒它的真相
that we need you to cure?

383
00:25:34,998 --> 00:25:37,858
你如此固执地认为我们是坏人
You're so focused on seeing us as the bad guys,

384
00:25:38,318 --> 00:25:40,058
却忽略了自己身边的人
you don't see what's right in front of you.

385
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:43,138
你对拜耶塞罗少校又有多少了解
How well do you know Major Balleseros?

386
00:25:44,308 --> 00:25:45,858
我五天前才认识他
I met him five days ago.

387
00:25:45,858 --> 00:25:48,898
我也是你五天前认识的  你就只信任他
Same day You met me. And you trust him?

388
00:25:49,478 --> 00:25:52,498
凭什么  就因为他穿军装吗
Why? Because he's wearing a uniform?

389
00:25:55,998 --> 00:25:58,358
你背上的伤疤是怎么回事
How did you get those scars on your back?

390
00:26:01,948 --> 00:26:05,158
多年前发生了一场大火
There was a fire, years ago,

391
00:26:06,138 --> 00:26:08,288
在我京都的家
at my home in Kyoto.

392
00:26:10,358 --> 00:26:14,848
我回去时整个房子都已经陷入火海
The entire house was in flames when I arrived.

393
00:26:15,358 --> 00:26:16,778
可我的女儿...
My daughter...

394
00:26:17,998 --> 00:26:19,808
还在里面
was still inside.

395
00:26:22,288 --> 00:26:24,088
我试图去救她
I tried to save her.

396
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:30,658
她是个什么样的人
What was she like?

397
00:26:31,738 --> 00:26:32,978
你的女儿
Your daughter.

398
00:26:36,578 --> 00:26:38,068
她很聪明
She was smart.

399
00:26:40,038 --> 00:26:42,048
对世界充满好奇
Curious about the world.

400
00:26:44,628 --> 00:26:45,838
你...
You...

401
00:26:50,438 --> 00:26:52,288
你很像她
... you remind me of her.

402
00:27:05,338 --> 00:27:07,598
外面有一阵子没有动静了
I haven't heard anything outside for a while.

403
00:27:07,598 --> 00:27:09,708
我们得赶紧去分诊实验室
We should try and get to the triage lab.

404
00:27:24,418 --> 00:27:26,338
你为什么改变心意了
What made you change your mind?

405
00:27:40,518 --> 00:27:43,908
我知道深陷痛苦的滋味
I know what it's like to be in pain.

406
00:27:44,938 --> 00:27:46,788
那种痛苦...
The kind of pain that you...

407
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,558
你会不计一切代价让它消失
you would do anything to make it stop.

408
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:54,748
虽然我从没考虑过自杀
And I've never considered ending it, but...

409
00:27:57,398 --> 00:28:01,308
但我们都想自己选择什么时候
... don't we all wish that we could control when we go

410
00:28:02,408 --> 00:28:03,898
什么方式死去
and how we go?

411
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:07,918
你真的想好了吗
Are you sure?

412
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:12,718
真的要这么做
Are you really sure?

413
00:28:15,338 --> 00:28:16,228
是的
Yes.

414
00:29:01,148 --> 00:29:02,208
谢谢
Thank you.

415
00:29:42,438 --> 00:29:43,548
找到了
Got something.

416
00:29:44,888 --> 00:29:46,118
这是塞姆汀
This is Semtex.

417
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:48,108
塑胶炸药
Plastic explosive.

418
00:29:49,708 --> 00:29:51,948
是拜耶塞罗破坏了卫星信号
Balleseros sabotaged the satellite.

419
00:29:53,528 --> 00:29:55,548
因为他不需要用卫星联系
Because he didn't need it to call out.

420
00:30:07,408 --> 00:30:10,658
从到这以来他一直在向谁报告
He's been sending messages to someone since we got here.

421
00:30:12,968 --> 00:30:14,968
朵琳的研究也在里面
Doreen's research is on here too.

422
00:30:17,238 --> 00:30:18,298
他杀了朵琳
He killed her.

423
00:30:22,008 --> 00:30:25,968
最后一条消息  "找到白色房间的
Here's the last transmission: "Found Dr. Hvit

424
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:29,398
威特博士  15时撤离"
in the white room. Evac 1500..."

425
00:30:30,218 --> 00:30:32,158
白色房间  那到底是什么意思
White room? What is the damn white room?

426
00:31:21,931 --> 00:31:25,041
杜尚  白色房间在哪
Duchamp. Where is the white room?

427
00:31:26,161 --> 00:31:27,871
我们都在白色房间里
We are all in the white room.

428
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:33,281
这是基地科学家之间的玩笑
It's an inside joke among the base scientists.

429
00:31:33,281 --> 00:31:37,011
我们在北极圈里  白色房间就是北极圈
We're in the arctic; it's all the white room.

430
00:31:38,011 --> 00:31:39,221
他们在基地外面
They're outside.

10431
00:32:00,521 --> 00:32:03,151
埃马・威特

432
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:22,511
看来你收到我的消息了
I see you got my message.

433
00:32:27,061 --> 00:32:30,631
多谢了  要不是你我还真找不到威特
Thanks. I would have never found Hvit without you.

434
00:32:43,181 --> 00:32:46,431
x博士  保持清醒  就快到了
Dr. Hatake, stay with me now. We're almost there.

435
00:32:47,621 --> 00:32:48,551
请你
Please...

436
00:32:49,671 --> 00:32:51,341
叫我宏就行
call me Hiroshi.

437
00:32:58,541 --> 00:33:00,051
快起来
Come on.

438
00:33:19,871 --> 00:33:21,411
你俩真慢啊
Took you guys long enough.

439
00:33:25,231 --> 00:33:27,411
这种暴风雪天气没人会出去
Nobody goes outside in a whiteout,

440
00:33:27,561 --> 00:33:29,781
两英尺外就是白雪茫茫
you won't even be able to see more than two feet in any direction.

441
00:33:29,781 --> 00:33:31,601
不是有导绳吗
There are guide ropes to follow, right?

442
00:33:31,611 --> 00:33:32,931
不是那么容易的
It's not that simple.

443
00:33:32,931 --> 00:33:36,131
零下60度的天气超乎你想象
You've never experienced anything like this. Minus 60,

444
00:33:36,131 --> 00:33:38,161
而风雪更会使寒意加倍
and the wind chill doubles that.

445
00:33:39,061 --> 00:33:42,631
如果你一定要去  你必须跟着大楼周围的导绳
Fine, if you're doing this, you stay on the guidelines

446
00:33:42,631 --> 00:33:46,021
直到你找到出去的那条
around the building until you get to the line going out.

447
00:33:46,031 --> 00:33:48,371
到那之前千万别解开绳子
Do not unclip until you get there,

448
00:33:48,371 --> 00:33:51,591
要不然你就会...彻底消失
or else you'll just... disappear.

449
00:33:58,051 --> 00:34:00,491
我推开了特蕾西然后一路狂奔
I managed to get Tracey off me, and then I ran.

450
00:34:00,491 --> 00:34:02,171
可能太黑了  她看不见我
It was too dark for her to see me, I guess.

451
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,581
我一头钻进最近的一个实验室
I ducked into the first lab I could find,

452
00:34:04,801 --> 00:34:07,631
-然后就来这了  -我当时真以为你必死无疑
- and then I came here. - I thought for sure you were dead.

453
00:34:08,051 --> 00:34:09,501
我也是这么想的
That makes two of us.

454
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:14,381
杰伊  我
Jaye, I --

455
00:34:14,381 --> 00:34:17,041
别再为没等我而自责了
Don't beat yourself up for closing that door.

456
00:34:17,251 --> 00:34:18,861
你以为我就在你身后
You thought I was right behind you.

457
00:34:22,331 --> 00:34:24,211
看起来我们搭档不错
Looks like we make a pretty good team.

458
00:34:24,541 --> 00:34:26,051
那可不是吗
We do, don't we?

459
00:34:28,511 --> 00:34:30,031
刚好  他快醒了
Good. He's waking up.

460
00:34:30,851 --> 00:34:33,611
看他还有什么关于他女儿的谎言要告诉我们的
Maybe he can tell us more lies about his daughter.

461
00:34:36,131 --> 00:34:37,441
你怎么知道...
How did you...

462
00:34:39,551 --> 00:34:40,861
你当时不在那
You weren't there.

463
00:34:40,861 --> 00:34:43,461
你很像她
You remind me of her.

464
00:34:44,731 --> 00:34:46,231
我不在哪
I wasn't where?

465
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:49,971
x宏说起女儿时你并不在场
You weren't there when Hatake told that story.

466
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:52,711
那不是我的姓名缩写  我从未来过这
They weren't my initials. I've never been here before.

467
00:34:52,711 --> 00:34:54,681
可你的笔迹又怎么解释
So how do you explain that it was your handwriting?

468
00:34:56,131 --> 00:34:58,601
幻觉是感染症状的一种
Hallucinations are one of the symptoms of the infection.

469
00:35:01,521 --> 00:35:02,431
不会的
No.

470
00:35:04,631 --> 00:35:07,421
不可能的  我看见你做了许多事情
That's not possible. I watched you do things.

471
00:35:07,421 --> 00:35:10,461
-你需要把伤口绑起来  -给
- ... Tie something around you for more pressure. - Here.

472
00:35:10,721 --> 00:35:13,731
-用这个  -快点
- Use this. - Hurry up.

473
00:35:20,271 --> 00:35:21,981
是你自己  茱尔斯
It was you, Jules.

474
00:35:23,731 --> 00:35:25,081
全是你自己想象出来的
It was all you.

475
00:35:26,101 --> 00:35:27,951
可你救了我这么多次
All those times you saved me.

476
00:35:37,601 --> 00:35:39,321
是你救了自己
You saved yourself.

477
00:36:34,231 --> 00:36:37,201
我要往回走  把绳扣换一下位置
Hey! Coming through! Switch clamps!

478
00:36:38,041 --> 00:36:40,161
你这个混帐  是你杀了她
You killed her, you bastard!

479
00:36:40,661 --> 00:36:42,661
你根本不清楚发生了什么
You have no idea what's going on here!

480
00:36:42,661 --> 00:36:45,471
朵琳的死只是附带伤害
Doreen was collateral damage-- ugh!

481
00:37:05,901 --> 00:37:07,671
很高兴认识你  博士
Nice knowing you, doc.

482
00:37:52,665 --> 00:37:54,505
拜耶塞罗从这进来了吗
Did Balleseros come back through here?

483
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:55,795
我没见到他
I haven't seen him.

484
00:37:56,635 --> 00:37:58,235
他在雪地里袭击了我
He attacked me on the ice.

485
00:37:58,645 --> 00:38:00,935
我们得召集一队安保人员去追捕他
We need to get a security team together and go after him.

486
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,785
这不是你该做的事情
You don't need to do anything.

487
00:38:02,785 --> 00:38:05,215
你一开始就不该去雪地里的
You should have never been on that ice in the first place.

488
00:38:05,815 --> 00:38:08,345
是他杀死了朵琳
He killed... Doreen.

489
00:38:09,715 --> 00:38:12,095
看起来他差点把你也杀了
Well, it looks like he almost killed you too.

490
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:27,665
这是我对你那条消息的回复
I've got a reply for that message!

491
00:39:05,255 --> 00:39:05,795
别动
Hold still.

492
00:39:05,795 --> 00:39:08,835
清洁小队请到C层食品储存室
Cleanup requested. Pantry, level c.

493
00:39:09,495 --> 00:39:12,205
清洁小队请到C层食品储存室
Cleanup requested. Pantry, level c.

494
00:39:12,205 --> 00:39:15,895
莎拉  知道我为什么选你参加这次行动吗
You know why I picked you for my team, Sarah?

495
00:39:16,695 --> 00:39:18,635
因为我是最合适的人选
Because I was the best candidate.

496
00:39:19,545 --> 00:39:21,035
因为你充满斗志
Because you were driven.

497
00:39:22,765 --> 00:39:25,465
我还记得你第一天走进我办公室
I remember the first day you walked into my office, and...

498
00:39:26,855 --> 00:39:28,395
当时我就心想
I thought to myself,

499
00:39:29,065 --> 00:39:30,905
"这个女孩  她一定在睡梦中
"That girl, even when she sleeps,

500
00:39:30,915 --> 00:39:33,355
都想着要做得比别人好"
She tries to do it better than anyone else."

501
00:39:39,665 --> 00:39:41,805
工作时  我们心无旁骛
Nothing distracts us from the work.

502
00:39:42,475 --> 00:39:45,045
但过于专注一件事情就会这样
But that's the problem with laser focus,

503
00:39:45,465 --> 00:39:48,085
我们看事情的角度会与别人不同
with our particular way of looking at the world.

504
00:39:50,965 --> 00:39:53,235
我们只能看见眼前发生的事  那些
We only see the thing in front of us, the thing...

505
00:39:54,295 --> 00:39:55,245
我们所关注的
under the microscope,

506
00:39:55,255 --> 00:39:57,825
而忽略了身边周围的一切
And we miss what's happening all around.

507
00:40:00,985 --> 00:40:02,995
这就是为什么我的婚姻会悲剧收场
That's why my marriage fell apart.

508
00:40:05,835 --> 00:40:07,175
这就是为什么我弟弟
That's why my brother...

509
00:40:08,265 --> 00:40:11,225
会选择来到这个地方
was up here in this... place.

510
00:40:17,335 --> 00:40:19,905
我不能一直犯同样的错误
I can't keep making the same mistakes.

511
00:40:20,535 --> 00:40:23,605
很抱歉之前我没有听你解释
I'm sorry I didn't listen to you before, but...

512
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:26,445
现在我想听听
I'm listening now.

513
00:40:30,975 --> 00:40:33,185
我经常会偏头痛
I get these migraines.

514
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:37,275
自大学起就这样  一旦发作起来
I've had them since college, and when they come on,

515
00:40:37,275 --> 00:40:40,845
我无法思考
I... I can't think,

516
00:40:40,845 --> 00:40:44,935
也无法工作  什么都干不了
I can't... work, I can't do anything.

517
00:40:48,035 --> 00:40:50,505
所以我从药品储藏室拿了些吗啡
I took some morphine from the drug stockroom.

518
00:40:54,325 --> 00:40:56,225
想着少量注射一点缓解症状
I thought if I just had a little bit to even me out,

519
00:40:56,225 --> 00:40:58,095
这样我就可以回去工作了
I'd be able to go back to work.

520
00:41:01,985 --> 00:41:02,525
真的很抱歉
I'm sorry.

521
00:41:02,525 --> 00:41:04,685
我之前绝没有干过这样的事  我保证
I've never done anything like this, I swear.

522
00:41:06,665 --> 00:41:08,155
没关系
It's ok.

523
00:41:09,915 --> 00:41:14,335
在这里  我们都迷失了一部分的自己
We've all lost ourselves... a little bit here.

524
00:41:26,145 --> 00:41:32,235
再一次  我的队伍离析分崩
My team... has fallen apart. Again.

525
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:38,425
上一次  我失去了你和茱尔斯
I lost you and Jules last time.

526
00:41:39,855 --> 00:41:41,595
这一次  我失去了朵琳
Now I've lost Doreen.

527
00:41:46,755 --> 00:41:48,498
我不知道该怎么做了
I don't know what to do.

528
00:41:53,935 --> 00:41:56,885
这向来是你最拿手的
You were always good at that part.

529
00:41:57,705 --> 00:42:01,014
就算在母亲最糟糕的那段日子
Even with mom, on her worst days,

530
00:42:01,705 --> 00:42:03,005
你仍心存希望
you had hope.

531
00:42:16,885 --> 00:42:18,795
我需要你给我一点希望
I need a little of your hope...

532
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,365
就是现在  彼得
right now, Peter.

10533
00:42:26,345 --> 00:42:29,215
{\an8}神经活动

1
00:00:01,301 --> 00:00:02,671
《双螺旋》前情提要
Previously on Helix...

2
00:00:02,671 --> 00:00:04,111
你什么时候知道自己长了肿瘤的
How long have you known about your tumor?

3
00:00:06,851 --> 00:00:07,811
你嗑药了吗
Are you high?

4
00:00:07,811 --> 00:00:09,371
我有点偏头痛  所以吃了...
I had a migraine, so I took--

5
00:00:09,371 --> 00:00:11,911
别骗我  除非你把整瓶都吃了
You're lying, unless you took the whole bottle.

6
00:00:12,741 --> 00:00:14,841
我不想变得像那些怪物一样
I don't want to become one of those things.

7
00:00:14,961 --> 00:00:16,741
你知道我是什么意思
You know what I'm asking.

8
00:00:17,691 --> 00:00:18,651
谢谢
Thank you.

9
00:00:19,581 --> 00:00:22,641
-他还有多久时间  -好好把握这最后的机会吧
- How long does he have? - Take this time and make the most of it.

10
00:00:23,241 --> 00:00:25,381
被感染的征状之一就是出现幻觉
Hallucinations are one of the symptoms of the infection.

11
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:29,631
这他妈根本不是意外
This wasn't a goddamn accident!

12
00:00:29,881 --> 00:00:31,511
这是我对你那条消息的回复
I've got a reply for that message!

10013
00:00:39,391 --> 00:00:45,691
{\an8}第六日

10014
00:01:27,611 --> 00:01:30,961
{\an8}姓名  朵琳・博伊尔博士

15
00:01:28,781 --> 00:01:30,151
对不起  朵琳
I'm sorry, Doreen.

16
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:33,491
我们并肩对抗了
We fought through...

17
00:01:33,891 --> 00:01:36,831
七次疾病爆发
seven outbreaks together,

18
00:01:38,341 --> 00:01:40,841
我一直以为是我在引领着你
and I always thought I was the one leading you.

19
00:01:43,071 --> 00:01:45,331
而事实上是你一直在鞭策着我进步
It turns out you were the one pushing me.

20
00:01:53,811 --> 00:01:55,691
找到拜耶塞罗了吗
Have you located Balleseros?

21
00:01:55,941 --> 00:01:57,191
还没有
No, not yet.

22
00:02:00,251 --> 00:02:02,581
朵琳遇害不是巧合
Doreen's murder was no coincidence.

23
00:02:04,451 --> 00:02:07,181
-我不懂你什么意思  -你懂得很
- I'm not sure I follow. - Oh, you follow just fine.

24
00:02:08,471 --> 00:02:10,251
不过我还是把话说明白吧
But let me spell it out for you anyway:

25
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:11,741
无论拜耶塞罗是什么阴谋
whatever Balleseros is up to,

26
00:02:11,741 --> 00:02:13,631
都绝对跟这个病毒有关
it has everything to do with this virus.

27
00:02:13,631 --> 00:02:15,981
你要装作毫不知情的样子  你随意
If you want to pretend you don't know that, that's fine.

28
00:02:16,311 --> 00:02:17,651
但我要找到他
But I want him found.

29
00:02:53,001 --> 00:02:53,751
这是谁
Who's this?

30
00:02:53,891 --> 00:02:55,161
瑞伊・范・艾根医生
Dr. Rae Van Eigem.

31
00:02:55,691 --> 00:02:58,271
R层封锁后  我在B层找到了她
I found her on Level B after Level R was sealed off.

32
00:02:58,871 --> 00:03:00,621
她在昏迷之前就已经死亡了
She died before the coma could set in.

33
00:03:00,621 --> 00:03:01,931
你在B层找到的她
You found her on Level B?

34
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:05,241
怎么不通知我
Why wasn't I notified?

35
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:07,041
时间紧迫
There wasn't time.

36
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:13,641
我将她隔离  并尽我所能地帮助了她
I isolated her and tended to her needs as best I could.

37
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:15,191
这是纳尔维克B
This is NARVIK-B.

38
00:03:15,191 --> 00:03:16,901
她应该是带菌者  而不是尸体
She should be a vector, not a corpse.

39
00:03:17,581 --> 00:03:18,961
她怎么死的  莎拉
How did she die, Sarah?

40
00:03:22,531 --> 00:03:25,751
吗啡过量
Morphine - overdose.

41
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:29,791
谁给的药
Who administered the dose?

42
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,711
我做了我认为正确的事
I did what I thought was right.

43
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:38,171
你那套不杀感染者理论也不过如此嘛  博士
So much for not killing the infected, right, Doc?

44
00:03:43,021 --> 00:03:44,501
我要去R层
I am going down to Level R

45
00:03:44,871 --> 00:03:46,551
带沃克博士回来
and I am bringing back Dr. Walker.

46
00:03:47,011 --> 00:03:48,731
你最好跟你上司知会一声
You might want to inform your boss.

47
00:03:48,731 --> 00:03:50,531
他在处理紧急事件
He's dealing with an emergency situation.

48
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:53,291
还有什么事能比这场病毒爆发
What emergency situation could possibly be more pressing

49
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,421
更紧急
than this outbreak?

50
00:03:54,421 --> 00:03:56,361
他办完事就会回来
He'll be back when he's finished,

51
00:03:56,621 --> 00:03:59,051
谁都不许去R层
and no one is going down to Level R

52
00:03:59,611 --> 00:04:04,231
出入都不行  包括沃克博士
no one in, no one out. That includes Dr. Walker.

53
00:04:06,801 --> 00:04:08,221
你要向我开枪吗  丹尼尔
You're gonna shoot me, Daniel?

54
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:10,861
是想这么做吗
Is that really your play here?

55
00:04:10,861 --> 00:04:12,181
你得回实验室
You need to get back to your lab.

56
00:04:12,181 --> 00:04:13,451
我不为你做事
I don't work for you!

57
00:04:14,031 --> 00:04:15,901
你到底知不知道现在什么情况
Do you have any idea what this thing is?

58
00:04:15,901 --> 00:04:17,061
这病毒对人有什么影响
What it's doing to people?

59
00:04:17,061 --> 00:04:19,131
我很清楚  他们病了
I'm aware, yes. People are sick.

60
00:04:19,141 --> 00:04:21,431
不是病了  是快死了
Not sick; they're dying!

61
00:04:21,751 --> 00:04:23,381
你弟有好转的迹象
Your brother is showing signs of improvement.

62
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:25,251
我弟几乎没有脑部活动
My brother barely has brain activity,

63
00:04:25,251 --> 00:04:26,591
全拜x宏所赐
no thanks to Hatake!

64
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:29,621
x博士和我跟你们目的一致
Dr. Hatake and I both want the same thing you do.

65
00:04:29,621 --> 00:04:32,681
你手里的枪可不是这么说的  孩子
That gun in your hand is telling a different story, son!

66
00:04:32,681 --> 00:04:34,011
你俩能消停会儿吗
Will you two cut it out?

67
00:04:36,331 --> 00:04:38,811
回去干你的活
Get... back to work.

68
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:41,061
现在就去
Now.

69
00:04:52,261 --> 00:04:53,441
我来处理她
I'll take care of her.

70
00:05:51,271 --> 00:05:52,051
彼得
Peter.

71
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,281
你来这里干什么
What are you doing here?

72
00:05:55,451 --> 00:05:56,691
我是来帮你的
I came to help you.

73
00:05:57,491 --> 00:05:59,321
帮我什么  你...
Help me with what? You...

74
00:06:02,231 --> 00:06:03,301
你不是真实存在的
You're not real.

75
00:06:08,341 --> 00:06:09,611
感觉很真实啊
Feels pretty real.

76
00:06:13,111 --> 00:06:14,051
快走开
Go away.

77
00:06:21,441 --> 00:06:22,491
我还在呢
Still here.

78
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:25,861
你让我留下肯定是有原因的
You must want me to stay for a reason.

79
00:06:26,711 --> 00:06:27,611
什么原因
Like what?

80
00:06:34,341 --> 00:06:35,321
她是谁
Who is she?

81
00:06:58,341 --> 00:06:59,121
你好
Hello?

10082
00:07:43,273 --> 00:07:51,742
《双螺旋》第一季第六集

83
00:07:54,881 --> 00:07:57,401
-那现在怎么办  -我要下去找茱莉亚
- So, what now? - I'm going down to get Julia.

84
00:07:57,521 --> 00:07:59,151
-等等  那...  -她写过一本书
- Wait, what about-- - She wrote the book

85
00:07:59,151 --> 00:08:01,991
是关于病毒拼接和RNA结合蛋白的
on viral splicing and RNA binding proteins.

86
00:08:01,991 --> 00:08:03,621
我需要...我们需要她
I need her - we need her -

87
00:08:03,621 --> 00:08:04,751
来一起攻克这个难题
to fight this thing.

88
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:06,041
艾伦  我们不清楚她现在的病情
Alan, we don't know how sick she is.

89
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,361
我们甚至都不清楚她能否正常工作
We don't even know if she can work.

90
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,651
我们是不知道  但是朵琳死了
No, we don't. But Doreen is dead,

91
00:08:09,751 --> 00:08:11,001
拜耶塞罗失踪了
Balleseros has gone missing,

92
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:12,711
所以我们又回到原点了
and we are back to square one.

93
00:08:12,711 --> 00:08:14,271
茱尔斯是我们最大的希望
Jules is our best hope.

94
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,221
-也是唯一的希望  -那我们怎么去R层
- She's our only hope. - How do we get down to Level R?

95
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:18,541
楼梯井被封了  电梯又被丹尼尔控制着
The stairwells are sealed shut and Daniel controls the elevator.

96
00:08:19,441 --> 00:08:20,761
我得再想办法
I'll have to improvise.

97
00:08:22,181 --> 00:08:24,631
对了  给你这个  治你的偏头痛的
By the way, these are for you, for your migraines.

98
00:08:25,861 --> 00:08:28,031
加巴喷丁  你在哪里...
Gabapentin. Where did you--

99
00:08:28,031 --> 00:08:31,201
是苏勒玛尼博士用来治疗强迫症的  应该管用
Dr. Sulemani used them for OCD. They should work.

100
00:08:31,251 --> 00:08:32,601
不要再用吗啡了
No more morphine.

101
00:08:34,201 --> 00:08:35,521
知道了吗  我需要你保持敏锐机警
All right? I need you sharp.

102
00:08:35,521 --> 00:08:38,521
现在就剩下我们俩了  如果我们不同心协力
You and I are all we have left. If we don't have each other,

103
00:08:38,521 --> 00:08:40,931
如果我们不互相帮助  我们就一无所有了
if we don't back each other up, we have nothing.

104
00:08:40,941 --> 00:08:43,811
当然了  还有...
Absolutely. And...

105
00:08:44,831 --> 00:08:45,841
谢谢你
thank you.

106
00:08:47,061 --> 00:08:49,461
自助餐厅开放
Cafeteria is now open.

107
00:08:49,851 --> 00:08:52,161
自助餐厅开放
Cafeteria is now open.

108
00:08:52,571 --> 00:08:54,371
自助餐厅...
Cafeteria is now--

109
00:09:24,161 --> 00:09:25,131
天哪
Oh, my God.

110
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:28,411
怎么了
What is it?

111
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:31,071
-你的伤口  -感染了吗
- Your wound. - Infection?

112
00:09:31,081 --> 00:09:34,331
不是  伤口愈合快得不可思议
No, it's... it's healing remarkably fast.

113
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,251
肯定是因为我基因好
Must have good genes.

114
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,051
肯定是的
Must have.

115
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,351
你没事吧
Are you all right?

116
00:09:50,971 --> 00:09:52,051
你为什么不告诉我
Why didn't you tell me?

117
00:09:53,011 --> 00:09:53,701
告诉你什么
Tell you what?

118
00:09:53,701 --> 00:09:56,811
我出现幻觉了  杰伊不是真的
That I was hallucinating! That Jaye wasn't real.

119
00:09:57,641 --> 00:09:59,481
你为什么要让我继续相信她的存在
Why did you let me go on believing she was here?

120
00:09:59,481 --> 00:10:01,411
你很喜欢看别人受罪煎熬吗
Do you enjoy watching people suffer?

121
00:10:01,411 --> 00:10:03,491
我跟你一样  也是名医生
I am a doctor first, like you.

122
00:10:03,981 --> 00:10:05,911
我的责任是救死扶伤
My job is to save people.

123
00:10:05,911 --> 00:10:07,001
用撒谎救死扶伤吗
By lying to them?

124
00:10:07,001 --> 00:10:09,301
我没告诉你是因为没这个必要
I didn't tell you, because I didn't need to.

125
00:10:10,681 --> 00:10:12,401
你当时神志不清
You were disoriented,

126
00:10:12,401 --> 00:10:15,201
跟杰伊说话好像对你有所帮助
and speaking to Jaye seemed to be helping.

127
00:10:20,081 --> 00:10:20,881
抱歉
I'm sorry.

128
00:10:22,731 --> 00:10:23,541
你说得对
You're right.

129
00:10:28,331 --> 00:10:29,101
救命啊
Help!

130
00:10:29,361 --> 00:10:30,351
救命
Help!

131
00:10:30,441 --> 00:10:31,801
不要
No!

132
00:10:33,311 --> 00:10:34,901
我们救不了所有人
Not everyone can be saved.

133
00:10:39,031 --> 00:10:39,831
沃克博士
Dr. Walker?

134
00:10:41,131 --> 00:10:41,851
茱莉亚
Julia!

135
00:10:43,061 --> 00:10:44,031
茱莉亚
Julia.

136
00:10:51,631 --> 00:10:53,481
我很久没做过铝热剂了
It's been a long time since I've made thermite.

137
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:56,161
上次还是高中毕业恶作剧的时候
It was in high school - senior prank.

138
00:10:59,221 --> 00:11:00,261
那次不太成功
It didn't go very well.

139
00:11:24,281 --> 00:11:25,751
这根本不是隔离
This was no quarantine;

140
00:11:26,371 --> 00:11:28,131
更像是"彻底封锁自生自灭"
it was a "seal and forget."

141
00:11:31,331 --> 00:11:34,211
里面很暗  我看不太清楚
Dark in there. I can't see much.

142
00:11:34,221 --> 00:11:36,201
他们可能都躲在实验室里
They're probably all huddled in the labs.

143
00:11:36,211 --> 00:11:37,611
这样肯定找不着她
We'll never find her like this.

144
00:11:39,201 --> 00:11:40,321
我们得进去看看
We have to go inside.

145
00:11:52,761 --> 00:11:54,671
我好像在走廊尽头看到了什么
I think I see something at the end of the hall.

146
00:12:19,941 --> 00:12:20,711
快跑
Go!

147
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:28,487
-让我看看  -艾伦  不用  我没事
- Come here. - Alan, stop. I'm fine.

148
00:12:28,487 --> 00:12:30,607
如果有任何擦伤或者创口之类的
If there's an abrasion or a cut or anything of the kind--

149
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,337
-真没事  -我们得确保无虞  你明白的
- I'm fine. - We have to make sure. You know that.

150
00:12:33,007 --> 00:12:34,437
我真没想到会有这么多带菌者
I had no idea there'd be so many of them.

151
00:12:34,437 --> 00:12:36,467
让你身处这么大的危险  我真是昏头了
I ought to have my head examined for putting you at risk.

152
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:37,797
是我自愿跟着你下来的
I chose to go down there with you.

153
00:12:37,797 --> 00:12:39,667
听着  先是朵琳  现在又是茱尔斯
Listen, first Doreen, then Jules.

154
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:41,317
我可不能再失去你了  莎拉
I can't lose you too, Sarah.

155
00:12:46,637 --> 00:12:48,207
那茱莉亚怎么办
What are we gonna do about Julia?

156
00:12:51,577 --> 00:12:53,377
为了找到她  我们得先对付那些...
To get to her, we have to go through those...

157
00:12:53,377 --> 00:12:57,057
-那些怪物  -我是想说"那些患者"
- Those monsters? - I was going to say "those patients."

158
00:12:57,177 --> 00:13:00,387
绝望的患者  我们要想帮助茱尔斯
desperately sick patients. If we want to get to Jules,

159
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,507
我们得先治好他们
we'll have to treat them first.

160
00:13:02,507 --> 00:13:03,687
要是治不好呢
What if we can't?

161
00:13:04,757 --> 00:13:06,427
那上头就会连同我们一起
Then they'll bury this base...

162
00:13:07,627 --> 00:13:08,717
将这基地彻底摧毁
with us in it.

163
00:13:19,707 --> 00:13:20,697
你干什么呢
What are you doing?

164
00:13:23,557 --> 00:13:24,877
你昏过去了
You passed out.

165
00:13:26,057 --> 00:13:27,267
别担心  茱莉亚
Don't worry, Julia.

166
00:13:28,017 --> 00:13:30,567
很快你就会没事了
We'll have you back on your feet in no time.

167
00:13:34,957 --> 00:13:37,327
你照我眼睛干什么  我看不清了
What are you doing to my eyes? I can't see.

168
00:13:42,607 --> 00:13:43,587
那是什么
What is that?

169
00:13:45,197 --> 00:13:47,057
我要给你打镇静剂
I'm giving you a sedative.

170
00:14:05,757 --> 00:14:07,237
你需要休息
You should sleep.

171
00:14:08,677 --> 00:14:09,847
我不想睡过去
I don't want to sleep.

172
00:14:09,867 --> 00:14:10,957
别说话
Shh.

173
00:14:12,657 --> 00:14:14,667
你会好起来的
You're going to be OK.

174
00:15:06,017 --> 00:15:07,447
准许进入
Access granted.

175
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,607
怎么回事
Aw! What the hell?

176
00:15:48,777 --> 00:15:51,137
-你是谁  -我还想问你呢
- Who are you? - I could ask you the same thing.

177
00:15:52,457 --> 00:15:53,427
我是阿娜娜
I'm Anana.

178
00:15:54,227 --> 00:15:55,267
阿娜娜
Anana?

179
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:57,367
我这是在哪
Where am I?

180
00:15:58,557 --> 00:15:59,717
你在我家里
You're in my home.

181
00:16:02,777 --> 00:16:04,247
这手铐有必要吗
Are these really necessary?

182
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,487
鬼知道你是谁啊
Don't know you from Adam.

183
00:16:06,657 --> 00:16:08,507
这么说  我也该把你铐起来
In that case, maybe I should cuff you too.

184
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,217
我叫塞尔西奥
I'm Sergio.

185
00:16:13,107 --> 00:16:15,817
看来我脸上这一拳是拜你所赐了
I assume I have you to thank for punching me in the face?

186
00:16:16,307 --> 00:16:17,397
谁叫你一个劲地反抗我
You kept trying to fight me.

187
00:16:17,397 --> 00:16:19,067
除此以外感觉怎么样  赛尔西奥
How are you feeling otherwise,Sergio?

188
00:16:19,207 --> 00:16:20,067
糟糕透顶
Like hell.

189
00:16:20,197 --> 00:16:21,357
那也比被扔在雪地里
That's better than expected for a guy

190
00:16:21,357 --> 00:16:22,827
等着被冻死要强得多
who was left for dead on the ice.

191
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:25,527
-这绿乎乎的是什么玩意  -这是海藻药膏
- What is this green shit? - It's a seaweed pack.

192
00:16:26,037 --> 00:16:29,247
这附近又找不着什么神医  所以将就着吧
We're not exactly near the Mayo Clinic, so relax.

193
00:16:30,667 --> 00:16:31,577
你是个警察
You're the law?

194
00:16:31,577 --> 00:16:35,077
汤拉尔定居点周围四百英里以内唯一的治安官
Only peace officer within 400 miles of Tonrar settlement.

195
00:16:37,307 --> 00:16:39,287
-汤拉尔是什么  -意思是"幽灵"
- Tonrar? - Means "Ghost."

196
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:41,217
其实没有名字说的这么吓人
Sounds scarier than what it is.

197
00:16:41,217 --> 00:16:42,997
我们不会在一个地点停留太久
We don't stay in one place very long.

198
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:46,347
给  喝了这个  能让你暖和点
Here, drink this. It'll warm you up.

199
00:16:46,777 --> 00:16:48,437
你手指头没冻掉真是运气好...
You're lucky to have all your fingers and--

200
00:16:52,247 --> 00:16:53,857
你这是想干什么
What'd you have to do that for,huh?

201
00:16:54,507 --> 00:16:55,907
我可是尽了地主之谊呢
I was trying to be hospitable.

202
00:16:55,907 --> 00:16:58,277
-疼  -疼就对了  正好让你明白状况
- It hurts. - Good! Let that be our introduction.

203
00:16:58,277 --> 00:16:59,227
你见鬼去吧
Bullshit!

204
00:16:59,237 --> 00:17:01,927
-怎么着  你想拿我当人质吗  -看情况
- What am I, a hostage? - Depends.

205
00:17:01,927 --> 00:17:03,767
局面会有多难看  全在你
This can be as dirty as you want it to be.

206
00:17:04,197 --> 00:17:07,047
-你想要什么  -要你脑袋里的
- What do you want? - I want what's in here.

207
00:17:07,697 --> 00:17:09,817
告诉我所有关于北极生物公司的事
Tell me what you know about Arctic Biosystems.

208
00:17:09,817 --> 00:17:11,557
我什么都不知道
I don't know anything.

209
00:17:11,557 --> 00:17:12,787
你想这么玩吗
That's how you want to play it?

210
00:17:13,417 --> 00:17:15,157
那好  或许你就该是人质
All right, then maybe you are a hostage.

211
00:17:16,647 --> 00:17:20,877
-真是荒唐  -如果你配合  那是最好
- This is ridiculous! - If you want to talk, great.

212
00:17:21,097 --> 00:17:22,787
如果不  我可以把你带回基地
If not, I can always bring you back to the base

213
00:17:22,787 --> 00:17:25,387
让想杀你的人完成他的使命
and let whoever tried to kill you finish off what they started.

214
00:17:29,907 --> 00:17:33,527
莎拉  来看这个
Sarah...come have a look at this.

215
00:17:38,317 --> 00:17:39,447
告诉你看到了什么
Tell me what you see.

216
00:17:42,987 --> 00:17:46,427
病毒在侵害细胞  迅速繁殖
The virus is attacking the cell, multiplying rapidly.

217
00:17:47,697 --> 00:17:50,097
再看看  仔细一点
Look again. Look more closely.

218
00:17:55,527 --> 00:17:56,557
天哪
Oh, my god.

219
00:17:56,627 --> 00:17:58,447
之前我居然没发现
I can't believe I didn't see it before.

220
00:17:59,107 --> 00:18:01,127
你怎么能发现呢  我们根本没注意这方面
How could you have? We weren't looking for it.

221
00:18:01,687 --> 00:18:03,817
他把病毒用作运载体
He's using the virus as a delivery mechanism.

222
00:18:03,827 --> 00:18:06,887
问题是  病毒要运送的是什么
The question is: what's the virus bringing to the party?

223
00:18:08,827 --> 00:18:09,797
原因又是什么
And why?

224
00:18:13,107 --> 00:18:14,247
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch.

225
00:18:24,887 --> 00:18:27,307
-法拉格特博士  -病毒里有什么
- Dr. Farragut. - What's in the virus?

226
00:18:28,077 --> 00:18:30,397
-什么也没有  -我亲眼看到了
- Nothing. - I saw it with my own eyes.

227
00:18:30,397 --> 00:18:32,297
你在基因序列中加入了什么
What did you splice into its genetic code?

228
00:18:32,297 --> 00:18:33,627
我听不懂你在说什么
I don't know what you mean.

229
00:18:33,627 --> 00:18:36,797
我知道你把病毒用作运载体
I know you're using the virus as a delivery mechanism.

230
00:18:37,087 --> 00:18:39,877
告诉我  你是不是在折腾什么基因疗法
Now, what kind of gene therapy are you messing with?

231
00:18:42,397 --> 00:18:45,047
你把我弟弟当成了小白鼠
You used my brother as a lab rat!

232
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,457
你搞砸了他的生活  茱莉亚的生活
You played with his life, with Julia's life,

233
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:49,757
还搞砸了R层那些可怜人的生活
with the rest of those poor people on Level R.

234
00:18:49,757 --> 00:18:52,197
你把基地建在这儿就没人能监管你
You put this place here so you wouldn't be regulated,

235
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:54,527
然后你就可以扮演上帝来操控别人的生活
so you could play God with people's lives!

236
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,547
看看你带来的后果吧
Look where's it's gotten you!

237
00:18:56,667 --> 00:18:58,387
告诉我真相
Tell me the truth.

238
00:19:02,127 --> 00:19:07,427
是的  纳尔维克的确是个运载体
Yes...NARVIK is a... delivery system.

239
00:19:07,797 --> 00:19:10,537
但法拉格特博士  这并不是阴谋
But there is no conspiracy, Dr. Farragut.

240
00:19:10,537 --> 00:19:12,887
阴谋论只是你幻想出来的
That, I'm afraid, is in your head.

241
00:19:13,297 --> 00:19:18,467
至于你弟弟...他也不是小白鼠
As far as your brother... he was no lab rat.

242
00:19:18,467 --> 00:19:20,977
那这到底是怎么回事
What then? What is all this?

243
00:19:21,957 --> 00:19:25,367
这是治疗绝症的一种方式
A way to treat what was once untreatable.

244
00:19:27,187 --> 00:19:28,177
癌症
Cancer.

245
00:19:28,277 --> 00:19:31,547
{\an8}世卫组织定义五大绝症包括艾滋病  恶性肿瘤
白血病  类风湿  肌萎缩侧髓硬化症

246
00:19:28,277 --> 00:19:31,547
化解全部"五大绝症"  试想一下
All five classifications. Think of it:

247
00:19:32,977 --> 00:19:36,577
一种能够治愈当代最致命疾病的疗法
a cure for one of the deadliest diseases of our time.

248
00:19:36,887 --> 00:19:39,857
病毒不用来害人而是是用来救人 
Instead of causing harm, the virus delivers a cure.

249
00:19:41,337 --> 00:19:42,147
真是妙点子
It's brilliant.

250
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:46,527
不幸的是  我们还没有完善它
Unfortunately, we haven't perfected it yet.

251
00:19:46,927 --> 00:19:48,167
不是因为病毒
It wasn't the virus.

252
00:19:48,237 --> 00:19:49,227
不是什么
What's not?

253
00:19:50,057 --> 00:19:54,577
病毒让彼得生病  但并不会改变他
The virus made Peter sick but it didn't change him.

254
00:19:54,577 --> 00:19:56,977
是病毒内的基因疗法改变了他
It was the gene therapy inside the virus.

255
00:19:56,977 --> 00:20:00,467
你在纳尔维克-B菌株里加了什么才改变了他
What did you put into the NARVIK-B strain that changed him?

256
00:20:00,477 --> 00:20:01,397
什么都没有
Nothing.

257
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,867
我们还没有在病毒中加入基因疗法
We hadn't introduced the gene therapy.

258
00:20:05,457 --> 00:20:08,777
病毒里有其它东西
There is something inside this virus.

259
00:20:10,597 --> 00:20:11,997
我会找出来的
And I will find it.

260
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:21,437
你得告诉我这到底怎么回事
I need you to tell me what's really going on here.

261
00:20:22,467 --> 00:20:24,217
不关你的事
It doesn't concern you.

262
00:20:24,377 --> 00:20:28,177
我唯一关心的就是你和基地的安全
Your safety and the safety of this base is my only concern.

263
00:20:28,807 --> 00:20:31,097
如果我被蒙在鼓里就没法保护你了
I can't protect you if I'm in the dark.

264
00:20:34,247 --> 00:20:36,057
你不在的时候发生了很多事情
A lot has happened while you were away.

265
00:20:37,227 --> 00:20:38,957
拜耶塞罗找到了威特博士
Balleseros found Dr. Hvit. -

266
00:20:39,317 --> 00:20:41,937
-什么  他是怎么...  -没事了
- What? How did he-- - it's not a problem.

267
00:20:41,937 --> 00:20:43,457
我已经把他解决了
I took care of him. -

268
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:47,067
解决了他  你干了什么
Took care of him? How?

269
00:20:47,217 --> 00:20:49,487
让他见识了一下冰镐的厉害
Introduced him to the business end of an ice axe.

270
00:20:49,647 --> 00:20:50,837
并留他在雪地里自生自灭
Left him out on the ice.

271
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,657
你到底做了什么
What have you done?

272
00:20:54,347 --> 00:20:56,327
是你说过他的存在对我们是一个威胁
You said yourself he was a threat.

273
00:20:56,867 --> 00:20:58,167
所以我解决了他
I eliminated him.

274
00:20:59,177 --> 00:21:01,497
你个蠢货  难道你不明白吗
You fool! Don't you see?!

275
00:21:04,447 --> 00:21:06,067
一旦他没及时向上级报告
When he fails to check in,

276
00:21:06,067 --> 00:21:07,867
那些人就会来了
they will come.

277
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,490
你需要吃点东西
You need to eat.

278
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,590
你的身体需要能量才能恢复
Your body is trying to heal.

279
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,059
说得好像你在乎似的
Like you care.

280
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,520
你死了对我没什么好处
You're no good to me dead.

281
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,140
好吧  那告诉我为什么我会在这里
Fine. I just want to know why I'm here.

282
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,520
所以我们又要开始兜圈子了吗
So, we're doing this dance again?

283
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,110
我说过  我想知道北极生物公司的事情
I told you why you're here. Arctic Biosystems.

284
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:50,550
我也说过了  我什么都不知道
I already told you, I don't know anything.

285
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,860
你知道的多到足以让别人对你下手
You knew enough that someone tried to shank your ass

286
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,850
杀人灭口了
and leave you for dead.

287
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:55,220
那是私人恩怨
That was a personal thing.

288
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:56,870
与基地无关
Had nothing to do with the base.

289
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,420
他们在做什么研究
What about the research they do?

290
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,090
还有那些孩子们
Tell me about the children.

291
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:04,480
什么孩子  你到底在胡说些什么
What children? What are you talking about?!

292
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,320
你不说拉倒  反正我们有的是时间
We can try this again later.

293
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,190
无论你怎么问  我的答案都是一样
Gonna be the same whenever you try it.

294
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,450
那就要看你能挨饿到什么程度了
That depends on how hungry you get!

295
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,540
这个年龄的孩子多可爱啊
They are so cute at that age.

296
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:56,310
这是哪  你为什么带我来这儿
What is this place? Why did you bring me here?

297
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,650
我只是来凑凑热闹而已
Hey, this is your dance party.

298
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,090
这可是你的舞会
I'm just along for the ride.

299
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,020
也许你应该问问她
Maybe you should ask her.

300
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,200
问什么
About what?

301
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:13,530
或许她正试图让你回想起一些事情
Maybe she's trying to get you to remember something.

302
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,620
一些你已经忘记的事情
Something you've forgotten.

303
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,900
已经忘记的事情我怎么还想得起来
How am I supposed to remember something I've forgotten?

304
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,810
有些事情只要你不想忘记
Nothing's ever really forgotten -

305
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,890
就永远不会忘
not if you don't want it to be.

306
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:30,190
去吧  去问问她
Go ahead, ask her.

307
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,380
你好
Hi.

308
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,150
我是茱莉亚
I'm Julia.

309
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,890
我也叫茱莉亚
That's my name too.

310
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,360
茱莉亚  这里是什么地方
What is this place, Julia?

311
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:13,330
这里是我家
This is my house.

312
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:16,070
你是说你住在这里吗
You mean you live here?

313
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,980
只有夏天才住这里
Only in the summer.

314
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:20,810
我和妈妈一起来的
I come here with my mommy.

315
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:24,420
我小时候也是和我母亲一起过夏天的
I used to spend the summer with my mommy too.

316
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,170
真的吗
You did?

317
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:28,170
嗯  在一个叫蒙大拿的地方
Mm-hmm. In a place called Montana.

318
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,570
你听说过这个地方吗
Have you ever heard of it?

319
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,630
我当然听过啦  傻瓜
Of course I have, silly.

320
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,820
我们现在不就在这儿吗
Where do you think we are right now?

321
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:46,150
没错  这是我长大的地方
Yes. This is where I grew up.

322
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,650
这里是蒙大拿
This is Montana,

323
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,370
我和母亲一起住过的地方
where I lived with my mother.

324
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,810
我回家了
I'm home.

325
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:29,860
接下来就是等吗
Now we wait.

326
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:32,060
只能如此了
Something like that.

327
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:38,030
怎么回事
What the hell?

328
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,150
你见过...
Have you ever...

329
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,620
它在做什么
What's it doing?

330
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,800
对低温产生了反应
Reacting to the cold.

331
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:19,290
极度低温
Extreme low temperatures.

332
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:20,950
会减慢病毒的效果
Slowing down the effects of the virus.

333
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,790
这说不定在人体上也行得通
Which means this might work on humans.

334
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:25,050
我们要给彼得降温
We need to get Peter on ice.

335
00:26:36,945 --> 00:26:39,245
把他头抬一下
Lift his head. All right.

336
00:26:39,905 --> 00:26:41,085
艾伦  那到底是什么东西
Alan, what was that thing?

337
00:26:41,085 --> 00:26:43,285
不管是什么  低温能延缓它的效果
Whatever it was, the cold slowed it down.

338
00:26:44,465 --> 00:26:46,315
我从没见过像这样的东西
I've never seen anything like that in my life.

339
00:26:46,315 --> 00:26:49,495
莎拉  没人见过这样的东西
Sarah, no one has seen anything like that.

340
00:26:54,365 --> 00:26:55,215
起作用了
It's working.

341
00:26:55,225 --> 00:26:57,185
起作用了  但是还要继续给他降温
It's working, but we have to get him colder.

342
00:26:57,365 --> 00:27:01,955
有个实验室  在G层  是研究冷沉淀的
There was a lab. Down on Level G, doing some kind of cryo work.

343
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:04,365
-谁的  -威克多・艾德里安博士
- Who? - Um... Dr. Victor Adrian.

344
00:27:04,365 --> 00:27:07,015
你呆在这里  持续给他降温并准备转移
You stay here. Get him colder and get him prepped to move.

345
00:27:07,015 --> 00:27:07,965
好
OK.

346
00:27:32,045 --> 00:27:33,635
钥匙
Key.

347
00:27:35,595 --> 00:27:36,635
钥匙
Key.

348
00:27:38,395 --> 00:27:39,335
休想
Don't.

349
00:27:40,165 --> 00:27:42,105
明白了吗
Understand?

350
00:27:44,885 --> 00:27:45,855
休想
Don't!

351
00:27:47,725 --> 00:27:49,235
你明白了吗
Do you understand?!

352
00:27:51,855 --> 00:27:56,535
-轻点  -想知道你为什么在这吗  看看
- Easy! - You want to know why you're here? Take a look.

353
00:27:56,785 --> 00:27:59,945
-看什么  一群小孩吗  -失踪儿童
- What am I looking at? A bunch of kids? - Missing kids.

354
00:27:59,975 --> 00:28:02,275
过去二十年来  北极生物公司周围
Thirty-one over the past two decades, all within

355
00:28:02,275 --> 00:28:06,585
二百英里的范围内发生了31起失踪儿童事件
200 miles of Arctic Biosystems and your precious Dr. Hatake.

356
00:28:06,945 --> 00:28:07,965
我不明白
I don't understand.

357
00:28:07,965 --> 00:28:10,565
有人在偷我们的孩子
Someone's been stealing our children.

358
00:28:10,905 --> 00:28:13,015
你根本不知道你保护的是什么人
You have no idea who you're protecting.

359
00:28:13,675 --> 00:28:15,605
或者你知道
Or maybe you do.

360
00:28:16,335 --> 00:28:17,465
你说呢
You tell me.

361
00:28:20,335 --> 00:28:24,195
你再轻举妄动  我就崩了你
You try anything again, I will shoot you.

362
00:28:28,395 --> 00:28:29,465
真有趣
That's funny.

363
00:28:33,035 --> 00:28:34,505
我们慢慢地从身后接近她
We'll sneak up on her slow.

364
00:28:34,795 --> 00:28:36,535
我就在你后边  别害怕
I'll be right behind you. Don't be afraid.

365
00:28:38,795 --> 00:28:40,035
威克多・艾德里安吗
Victor Adrian?

366
00:28:42,815 --> 00:28:44,595
我是疾控中心的艾伦・法拉格特
I'm Alan Farragut of the CDC.

367
00:28:44,595 --> 00:28:45,765
滚蛋
Piss off.

368
00:28:49,465 --> 00:28:51,505
-我正看着呢  -我需要你的帮助
- I was watching that. - I need your help.

369
00:28:51,505 --> 00:28:54,295
我被关在这里都一个星期了
I've been stuck here for a week

370
00:28:54,305 --> 00:28:55,895
如同困兽一般
like a caged animal.

371
00:28:56,135 --> 00:28:58,585
你还指望我热情欢迎你吗
What do you expect me to do? Put out a welcome mat?

372
00:28:58,585 --> 00:29:01,195
我知道这情况不怎么理想
I know the situation has been less than ideal.

373
00:29:02,585 --> 00:29:05,625
这可真是年度最佳轻描淡写
Now that is the understatement of the year.

374
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:09,785
我这么做有什么好处
What do I get out of it?

375
00:29:09,785 --> 00:29:12,355
-你说什么  -等价交换
- Excuse me? - Quid pro quo.

376
00:29:12,595 --> 00:29:15,735
我帮了你这个忙  你也得回报我
I scratch your back, you scratch mine.

377
00:29:16,585 --> 00:29:18,205
-你同意吗  -你想要什么
- Do we understand each other? - What is it you want?

378
00:29:18,205 --> 00:29:20,285
首先  把守卫撤走
First, you're gonna call off the guards.

379
00:29:20,285 --> 00:29:21,225
这六天来我连拉屎
I haven't taken a shit without

380
00:29:21,225 --> 00:29:23,095
都得有人监视着
a chaperone for the last six days.

381
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:27,045
其次  我要在救援到来后
Second, I want to be first in line

382
00:29:27,045 --> 00:29:28,765
第一个离开这鬼地方
out of this hell-hole when the cavalry arrive.

383
00:29:28,765 --> 00:29:30,995
行  只要你帮我解决这事
All right, all right. You help me solve this,

384
00:29:30,995 --> 00:29:32,675
我保证你排在第一个
and you will be first in line.

385
00:29:32,675 --> 00:29:33,915
我向你保证
I guarantee it.

386
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:39,125
艾伦・法拉格特博士
Dr. Alan Farragut,

387
00:29:40,435 --> 00:29:42,585
有何能为你效劳的
how may I be of assistance?

388
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:47,865
你是研究冷却系统的
You work with cooling systems?

389
00:29:48,725 --> 00:29:49,955
冷沉淀疗法
Cryo-therapy?

390
00:29:49,985 --> 00:29:52,685
变频浸没降温  我的最新成果
VFC Immersion. Latest and greatest.

391
00:29:52,685 --> 00:29:53,845
真的有效吗
Does it work?

392
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:58,965
不如你亲自来跟我的小朋友们打个招呼如何
Why don't you say hello to some of my friends?

393
00:31:01,245 --> 00:31:05,445
-给我住手  -你俩都为x宏效力
- Stop right there! - You both work for Hatake.

394
00:31:05,445 --> 00:31:06,915
-是吗  -放开他
- Is that it?! - Let him go.

395
00:31:06,925 --> 00:31:11,155
-就是他在基地要杀了我  -你说什么
- He tried to kill me back at the base! - What? When?

396
00:31:11,155 --> 00:31:14,405
你想要x宏的信息  找他就行了
You want information about Hatake? Here's your man!

397
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:16,585
来啊  问他
Go ahead! Ask him!

398
00:31:16,585 --> 00:31:19,705
你疯了吗  这是我弟弟
Are you out of your mind?! That's my brother!

399
00:31:19,705 --> 00:31:23,575
-丹尼尔是你弟弟  -丹尼尔是谁
- Daniel is your brother? - Who's Daniel?

400
00:31:23,865 --> 00:31:25,535
这是我弟弟图克
That's my brother Tulok!

401
00:31:39,357 --> 00:31:41,467
能告诉我你为什么要袭击我弟弟吗
You want to tell me why you attacked my brother?

402
00:31:42,077 --> 00:31:45,277
我只是...想逃跑
I was just... trying to escape.

403
00:31:51,387 --> 00:31:53,607
这是我和弟弟们的照片
This is a picture of me and my brothers.

404
00:31:53,997 --> 00:31:55,147
他们是双胞胎
Twins.

405
00:31:56,227 --> 00:31:57,977
你刚见到的是图克
You met Tulok outside.

406
00:31:57,977 --> 00:31:59,427
这个是米嘉
This is Miksa.

407
00:32:00,707 --> 00:32:02,617
在我们还小时他就失踪了
He disappeared when we were kids.

408
00:32:02,617 --> 00:32:04,177
当时他只有四岁
He was only four years old.

409
00:32:06,377 --> 00:32:07,737
米嘉现在在哪
Where's Miksa now?

410
00:32:07,957 --> 00:32:10,067
明知故问  你这个混蛋
You tell me, you son of a bitch.

411
00:32:10,067 --> 00:32:14,117
-你见过他吧  -我得回基地
- Have you seen him? - I need to go back to the base.

412
00:32:14,577 --> 00:32:17,707
我要和你一起去
We need to go back to the base.

413
00:32:28,937 --> 00:32:31,597
我从没在人体身上试验这项技术
Look, I didn't know we'd be trying this out on an actual person,

414
00:32:32,047 --> 00:32:34,677
还是一个状况如此糟糕的人
let alone someone as bad off as he is.

415
00:32:36,467 --> 00:32:39,317
-我保证不了什么  -明白
- I can't promise anything. - Understood.

416
00:32:42,567 --> 00:32:45,027
变频浸没降温
VFC immersion hypothermia.

417
00:32:45,977 --> 00:32:48,927
第一次人体临床试验
Human trials, take one.

418
00:32:50,327 --> 00:32:51,257
你要如何抑制
How do you stop the body's

419
00:32:51,257 --> 00:32:53,487
人体自身的御寒机能呢
natural defense mechanisms against the cold?

420
00:32:53,487 --> 00:32:55,527
这就要靠我这套特殊的冷却流程了
It is all in how we cool the body down.

421
00:32:55,667 --> 00:32:58,177
冷却液进入肺部的同时
The solution is taken into his lungs

422
00:32:58,187 --> 00:33:00,367
也将从皮肤渗入
while it simultaneously soaks into the skin

423
00:33:00,367 --> 00:33:04,037
从里到外完全包裹身体
and envelops the entire body, inside and on the out.

424
00:33:04,087 --> 00:33:05,637
那他怎么维持呼吸
So how does he breathe?

425
00:33:05,977 --> 00:33:07,337
他不需要呼吸
He doesn't breathe.

426
00:33:08,577 --> 00:33:10,817
人体在九个月的胚胎阶段就不呼吸
Humans don't breathe for the first nine months.

427
00:33:11,267 --> 00:33:13,357
只要维持他的血氧即可
It's a matter of keeping him oxygenated.

428
00:33:14,637 --> 00:33:17,337
成功与否你都会遵守我们的约定吧
Either way, we still have a deal right?

429
00:33:17,697 --> 00:33:19,137
不论他是生是死
No matter how this goes.

430
00:33:22,287 --> 00:33:24,267
再给我一点时间就好  彼得
Just give me a little more time, Peter.

431
00:33:25,567 --> 00:33:26,827
开始吧
Let's do this.

432
00:33:52,637 --> 00:33:54,587
茱莉亚  快来吃晚餐
Julia, come on. Time to eat.

433
00:34:04,447 --> 00:34:05,817
你怎么也在这
Why are you here?

434
00:34:06,187 --> 00:34:08,637
是你害她生病的  都是你的错
You're the one that made her sick. This is all your fault.

435
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:12,007
我的错  这怎么能怪我呢
My fault? Don't blame me.

436
00:34:12,017 --> 00:34:13,727
我们都是因为她才被困在这的
We're all trapped here because of her.

437
00:34:14,107 --> 00:34:16,637
-你这么说不公平  -谁说要公平了
- That's not fair. - Who said anything about fair?

438
00:34:16,867 --> 00:34:17,647
这是你的潜意识
This is all in your head.

439
00:34:17,647 --> 00:34:19,207
问题是你让我们来这干什么
Why are we even here?

440
00:34:19,567 --> 00:34:20,677
我不知道
I don't know.

441
00:34:21,527 --> 00:34:24,307
能请你递一下蔓越莓酱吗
Pass the cranberry sauce.

442
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:28,667
-谢谢  -所有都因你而起  茱莉亚
- Thank you - It's all about you, Julia.

443
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:30,137
一直都是
It's always been about you.

444
00:34:30,137 --> 00:34:32,207
他说的没错
He's right, y'know. He's right.

445
00:34:32,207 --> 00:34:33,927
是你让我们陷入了这场麻烦
You got us into this mess.

446
00:34:33,927 --> 00:34:36,057
我没有  我不是  我只是
I'm not -- I mean, I didn't -- I just,

447
00:34:36,057 --> 00:34:38,267
我不是故意的  拜托
I didn't mean to get -- Oh, come on.

448
00:34:39,287 --> 00:34:40,577
我也想知道为什么
I just want answers.

449
00:34:40,587 --> 00:34:43,007
你连真正的问题是什么都不清楚
You don't even know the right questions to ask.

450
00:34:44,867 --> 00:34:46,547
为什么找你  茱莉亚
Why you, Julia?

451
00:34:46,687 --> 00:34:49,587
为什么会有这种病毒  为什么现在爆发
Why this virus? Why now?

452
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:50,547
饿死了
I'm starved.

453
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:52,007
我们能边吃边说吗
Can we do this while we eat?

454
00:34:54,057 --> 00:34:56,377
其实你知道所有答案  只是你没意识到罢了
You have all the answers. You just don't know it.

455
00:34:57,127 --> 00:34:59,177
我在努力  可还是想不起来
I'm trying to remember, but I can't.

456
00:34:59,557 --> 00:35:00,627
那就快想
Just figure it out already.

457
00:35:00,627 --> 00:35:02,977
快想出来我们好吃饭
Figure it out so we can eat.

458
00:35:02,987 --> 00:35:05,037
有人要红薯吗
Would anyone like sweet potatoes?

459
00:35:09,847 --> 00:35:12,457
也许问题的重点不在于我们
Maybe the question isn't why we're here

460
00:35:12,457 --> 00:35:14,827
而在于我们为什么会在这
as much as why are we're HERE -

461
00:35:15,977 --> 00:35:19,097
在这  这个你长大的小木屋
this place, the cabin where you grew up.

462
00:35:19,097 --> 00:35:23,797
也许吃点东西问题就能迎刃而解了
Maybe this would be easier if we all ate something.

463
00:35:27,387 --> 00:35:28,777
你能来切火鸡吗  茱尔斯
Will you carve, Jules?

464
00:35:50,167 --> 00:35:52,937
等等  不该是这样的
Wait, this isn't supposed to be happening.

465
00:35:54,387 --> 00:35:56,337
这不是真的
This is not happening!

466
00:36:05,627 --> 00:36:07,377
这样真的没问题吗
Are y... are you sure about this?

467
00:36:07,377 --> 00:36:08,607
他会适应的
He'll adapt.

468
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,867
他会稳定下来的  这是正常反应
He'll settle. It's normal.

469
00:36:20,867 --> 00:36:21,817
你怎么知道
Normal for what?

470
00:36:21,817 --> 00:36:24,277
没事的  那些猴子和他的反应一样
It's OK. The monkeys did the exact same thing.

471
00:36:24,277 --> 00:36:25,027
还有老鼠也是
The rats too.

{\an8}无反应

473
00:36:39,207 --> 00:36:42,007
这会害死他的  艾伦
This is killing him. Alan.

474
00:36:43,547 --> 00:36:44,437
艾伦
Alan!

475
00:36:46,627 --> 00:36:48,727
-他要被淹死了  -不  不要
- He's drowning. - No. No.

476
00:36:48,937 --> 00:36:50,957
这是唯一能救回他的方式了
If there's any chance we could save him...

477
00:36:51,477 --> 00:36:53,417
他的体温在下降
His core temperature's dropping.

478
00:36:55,467 --> 00:36:56,627
35摄氏度
It's 95.

479
00:36:57,317 --> 00:36:57,867

Eighty-five.

00:37:14,317 --> 00:37:15,697
他能看见我们吗
Can he see us?

486
00:37:19,817 --> 00:37:22,657
我想不能
No. I don't think so.

487
00:37:23,997 --> 00:37:25,277
但这确实起作用了
But it's something.

488
00:37:27,317 --> 00:37:28,617
有进展了
Progress.

489
00:37:40,257 --> 00:37:43,287
疾控中心似乎有了突破性进展
The CDC seems to have had a breakthrough.

490
00:37:43,677 --> 00:37:45,587
抱歉让你失望了
I'm sorry for disappointing you.

491
00:37:47,497 --> 00:37:49,817
-请原谅我  父亲  -是我的错
- Please forgive me, father-- - It's my fault.

492
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,187
是我还没有将你准备好
I didn't prepare you well enough.

493
00:37:56,697 --> 00:37:57,927
这是我的失误
I made a mistake.

494
00:37:57,927 --> 00:38:02,557
没什么失误可言  只有被浪费了的机会
There are no mistakes, only opportunities wasted.

495
00:38:04,487 --> 00:38:05,917
这种事不会再发生了
It won't happen again.

496
00:38:07,707 --> 00:38:12,307
那就好  因为我们的时间已经不多了
Good. We don't have much time to prepare.

497
00:38:14,527 --> 00:38:15,827
你想让我做什么
What do you want me to do?

498
00:38:18,827 --> 00:38:19,967
首先...
First...

499
00:38:22,047 --> 00:38:24,977
带我去看看拜耶塞罗少校的尸体
show me Major Balleseros' body.

500
00:38:41,737 --> 00:38:42,867
太神奇了
It's amazing.

501
00:38:43,177 --> 00:38:44,937
虽然他的大脑活动还没完全恢复
Brain activity isn't 100%,

502
00:38:44,937 --> 00:38:46,937
但毕竟有所好转了
but it's a start.

503
00:38:50,957 --> 00:38:52,377
艾伦  你还好吗
Alan, are you OK?

504
00:39:54,883 --> 00:39:56,463
我就把他留在这里了
This is where I left him.

505
00:39:56,773 --> 00:39:57,803
就是这里
Right here.

506
00:39:59,353 --> 00:40:00,993
我脱下了他的外套和靴子
I took his jacket and boots.

507
00:40:00,993 --> 00:40:02,403
他走不了多远的
He couldn't have got far.

508
00:40:14,763 --> 00:40:16,023
他是被人带走了
He's been taken.

509
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:18,683
我去找他
I'll go find him.

510
00:40:20,113 --> 00:40:21,113
不用
No.

511
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:23,533
我们回头再处理这件事
We'll deal with this later.

512
00:40:25,053 --> 00:40:26,183
他们来了
They're here.

513
00:40:46,363 --> 00:40:47,483

Are you OK?

514
00:40:49,503 --> 00:40:50,493

感谢上帝  救援终于到了

58
00:03:07,975 --> 00:03:10,155
来控制这场可怕的传染病
to contain this terrible disease?

59
00:03:11,155 --> 00:03:14,309
我队伍里不可或缺的成员  沃克博士
An integral member of my team, uh, Dr. Walker,

60
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,596
正被困于R层
is trapped down on Level R.

61
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:17,895
-我需要她回来  -不可能
- I need her back. - Impossible.

62
00:03:17,895 --> 00:03:20,905
x博士  别这样  我们得化解现在的困局
Dr. Hatake, please. Let's square the circle here.

63
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:23,065
沃克博士为什么被关起来了
Dr. Walker, why is she locked up?

64
00:03:23,135 --> 00:03:24,355
她受到了感染
She's infected.

65
00:03:26,545 --> 00:03:27,955
我很遗憾
I'm so sorry.

66
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,665
她是研究RNA结构方面的专家
She's an expert in RNA structure.

67
00:03:33,845 --> 00:03:36,055
她很重要  因为...
And that's important because...?

68
00:03:36,075 --> 00:03:37,595
RNA的用途是携带信息
RNA carries the message.

69
00:03:37,595 --> 00:03:40,345
我们将疗法指导储存在DNA中
We store the instructions for the cure in the DNA,

70
00:03:40,355 --> 00:03:42,085
然后由RNA携带传递
and then the RNA passes it on,

71
00:03:42,085 --> 00:03:44,915
因此  她是我团队中最重要的人
and that makes her the most important member of my team.

72
00:03:47,655 --> 00:03:49,575
诶拉瑞亚就是来给你们提供额外帮助的
Well, Ilaria is about value-add.

73
00:03:49,575 --> 00:03:52,565
既然你需要沃克博士  那就给你
If Dr. Walker is what you need, Dr. Walker is what you will get.

74
00:03:53,485 --> 00:03:55,235
克莱恩中尉  制定个计划
Lieutenant Klein, let's prepare a plan

75
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,125
-把沃克博士带回来  -是  长官
- to retrieve Dr. Walker. - Yes, ma'am.

76
00:03:57,675 --> 00:04:00,715
艾伦  我只要一样东西  解药
Alan, one thing; one thing only: a cure.

77
00:04:01,195 --> 00:04:02,095
拜托你了
Please.

78
00:04:04,575 --> 00:04:05,285
现在
Now,

79
00:04:05,465 --> 00:04:07,045
x博士  我们能谈谈吗
Dr. Hatake, may we have a word?

80
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,385
单独谈谈  如果你不介意的话
In private, if you don't mind.

81
00:04:26,055 --> 00:04:27,215
康斯坦丝
Constance.

82
00:04:27,665 --> 00:04:28,855
宏
Hiroshi.

83
00:04:39,945 --> 00:04:41,095
我们只要两样东西  宏
Two things, Hiroshi!

84
00:04:41,095 --> 00:04:44,215
两样很简单的东西 仅此而已
Two simple things. That's all we needed.

85
00:04:44,215 --> 00:04:46,045
我制造出了你要的病毒
I created your virus--

86
00:04:46,045 --> 00:04:47,535
但解药在哪儿呢
Where is the cure?!

87
00:04:50,345 --> 00:04:52,555
病毒和解药
Virus and cure.

88
00:04:52,855 --> 00:04:54,735
两者缺少任何一个都没有任何意义
One without the other is meaningless.

89
00:04:54,865 --> 00:04:58,295
我们可不想杀光所有人  只是减少点数量而已
We don't want to kill everybody; just thin the herd a bit.

90
00:04:59,145 --> 00:05:00,505
然后统治他们
And rule them.

91
00:05:01,015 --> 00:05:04,225
是时候了  我们已经等得够久了
It's time. We've waited long enough.

92
00:05:04,235 --> 00:05:05,365
你明白的
You know that.

93
00:05:06,455 --> 00:05:08,735
我们遇到了一点困难
There have been a few setbacks.

94
00:05:09,055 --> 00:05:10,275
你失败了
You failed.

95
00:05:12,685 --> 00:05:13,955
谢天谢地疾控中心的人来了
Thank God the CDC arrived

96
00:05:13,955 --> 00:05:17,235
-替你做了你的工作  -是替你
- to do your job for you. - For you.

97
00:05:19,985 --> 00:05:22,755
我所听说的另一棵菌株  是干什么的
What is this other strain that I'm hearing about?

98
00:05:23,655 --> 00:05:26,105
纳尔维克-B  那种能把人变成...
NARVIK-B, the one that turns people into...

99
00:05:27,055 --> 00:05:29,265
只是对病毒的另一种尝试罢了
An alternate attempt at the virus.

100
00:05:29,925 --> 00:05:30,685
为什么
Why?

101
00:05:32,485 --> 00:05:35,795
从A菌株上很难研制出解药
The cure has been elusive in the A strain.

102
00:05:36,225 --> 00:05:37,455
也许B菌株能...
Perhaps the B strain--

103
00:05:37,456 --> 00:05:41,525
你简直是满嘴胡言  宏
Perhaps you are full of shit, Hiroshi.

104
00:05:42,095 --> 00:05:43,625
这是威利斯假说
It's the Willis hypothesis.

105
00:05:42,095 --> 00:05:46,075
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}又称"老种广布学说"  提出若某物种年代越久远  其地理分布越广泛  因此物种极少自然灭绝  需借助外力

106
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:46,075
我们当时不同意  现在也一样
We said no then. Nothing has changed.

107
00:05:46,535 --> 00:05:49,105
病毒和解药
Virus and cure.

108
00:05:49,105 --> 00:05:50,165
多简单
Simple.

109
00:05:52,095 --> 00:05:54,555
你真的打算去R层吗
Do you really plan to go down to Level R?

110
00:05:55,965 --> 00:05:58,845
去把这个叫沃克的带回来吗  没错
To get this Walker? Yes.

111
00:05:58,965 --> 00:06:00,805
既然法拉格特博士需要她  那就给他
If Dr. Farragut needs her, he gets her.

112
00:06:01,275 --> 00:06:03,845
-解药现在就靠他了  -然后呢
- The cure is in his hands now. - And then?

113
00:06:03,845 --> 00:06:07,605
然后我们依照标准无人协议  不留活口
And then we follow normal null protocol. No witnesses.

114
00:06:08,655 --> 00:06:10,795
这些人是我的手下
These people are my employees,

115
00:06:11,425 --> 00:06:12,805
我对他们负有责任
my responsibility.

116
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:15,337
没人能活着离开这  宏
No one gets out alive, Hiroshi.

117
00:06:15,338 --> 00:06:16,775
在开始前你就知道的
You knew that before we started.

118
00:06:18,275 --> 00:06:19,945
那疾控中心的人呢
What about the CDC?

119
00:06:20,205 --> 00:06:22,275
如果他们没能活着回去会怎么样
If they fail to return?

120
00:06:22,275 --> 00:06:24,885
我们有专人负责这类事情
We have people in place to control such things.

121
00:06:28,475 --> 00:06:29,975
如果我...
And if I...

122
00:06:30,555 --> 00:06:34,195
发现你背叛了我们...
find out that you betrayed us...

123
00:06:37,245 --> 00:06:40,115
你和这个基地最终
...the only thing left of you or this facility

124
00:06:40,635 --> 00:06:43,985
都只会成为这雪地里一道黑色的伤疤
will be a blackened scar on the ice.

125
00:06:47,245 --> 00:06:48,395
说吧
Now say it.

126
00:06:50,855 --> 00:06:52,045
说出来
Say it.

127
00:06:55,645 --> 00:06:57,815
没人能活着离开这
No one gets out alive.

10128
00:07:00,346 --> 00:07:09,182
《双螺旋》第一季第七集

129
00:07:13,255 --> 00:07:16,325
给我松绑吧  拜托
Agh! Come on! Please?

130
00:07:16,325 --> 00:07:19,505
求我吗  还以为你们军人都是硬骨头呢
Begging? Thought you military guys were tough.

131
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:21,475
至少解开一只手让我能抓牢
Just one hand even, so I can hold on.

132
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:24,385
-没门  -还有多远
- No. - How much farther?

133
00:07:24,385 --> 00:07:27,085
-很远  -"很远"
- Far. - "Far!"

134
00:07:27,985 --> 00:07:29,265
你在学我说话吗
Are you mocking me?

135
00:07:29,265 --> 00:07:31,455
还是你想听我唱《一百瓶啤酒》
Would you prefer I sang "One Hundred Bottles of Beer?"

136
00:07:31,455 --> 00:07:33,115
我更希望你闭嘴
I'd rather you shut your mouth!

137
00:07:33,115 --> 00:07:36,425
那你给我松绑  我保证再不说话
- Well, then untie me, and I promise you won't hear a word.

138
00:07:36,425 --> 00:07:38,475
或者我也可以加速  让你掉下去
Or I could just speed up, you fall off,

139
00:07:38,475 --> 00:07:40,165
我就不用再听你废话了
and then I won't have to hear you yapping.

140
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:41,785
我还是觉得我的方案好点
I like my plan better.

141
00:08:01,965 --> 00:08:02,985
我们得谈谈
We need to talk.

142
00:08:03,805 --> 00:08:05,735
关于  关于萨顿
About... about Sutton.

143
00:08:06,645 --> 00:08:07,845
她怎么了
What about her?

10144
00:08:14,445 --> 00:08:15,745
{\an8}外界通话系统
关闭

145
00:08:18,575 --> 00:08:20,365
我认为她对我们有所保留
I don't think she's telling us everything;

146
00:08:20,365 --> 00:08:22,495
从x宏让我们经历的这些事就能看出来
not with what Hatake's been putting us through.

147
00:08:23,165 --> 00:08:24,865
-什么意思  -我是说
- What do you mean? - What I mean

148
00:08:25,225 --> 00:08:28,625
她和我们的目的并不相同
is I don't think our agenda is her agenda.

149
00:08:28,855 --> 00:08:32,725
也对  这个时候派萨顿和她的私人军队
Right. Where's the profit in sending Sutton

150
00:08:32,725 --> 00:08:33,835
进驻基地能有什么好处呢
and her private army up here?

151
00:08:33,845 --> 00:08:34,905
尤其是我们已经在
Especially when we're already

152
00:08:34,905 --> 00:08:37,465
-义务为他们解决麻烦了  -这些大医药公司
- cleaning up their mess for free. - Big pharma.

153
00:08:37,465 --> 00:08:38,845
你知道他们关心的只有利润
You know they're only interested in the bottom line.

154
00:08:38,845 --> 00:08:40,295
并非真心造福大众
They don't really want to help people.

155
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:43,015
谁又知道他们为了保护投资能做出什么事情
And who knows how far they'll go to protect their investment?

156
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,365
但我们不能停止研发解药
We can't stop working on a cure.

157
00:08:45,365 --> 00:08:47,195
是不能  还有好多人命悬一线
No, too many lives at stake.

158
00:08:48,105 --> 00:08:50,505
但我们不能为萨顿干活
But we do not work for Sutton.

159
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,675
不让她知道我们的解药
We keep the cure from her.

160
00:08:57,725 --> 00:08:58,895
也许得留这一手
We may need it.

161
00:10:21,895 --> 00:10:23,775
餐厅开放中
Cafeteria is now open.

162
00:10:24,805 --> 00:10:26,765
餐厅开放中
Cafeteria is now open.

163
00:10:26,795 --> 00:10:27,765
丹尼尔
Daniel.

164
00:10:29,485 --> 00:10:31,505
x宏的养子
Hatake's adopted son.

165
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:35,875
但你应该知道给你发薪水的是我们吧
Though on some level you do realize that we pay your salary, yes?

166
00:10:36,445 --> 00:10:37,735
就是说我卖身给你们了是吧
So you've already bought me.

167
00:10:38,685 --> 00:10:40,605
"购买了你出色的服务"更为贴切
Paid for excellent service, rather.

168
00:10:41,715 --> 00:10:44,025
你之前见过这位沃克博士吗
Did you have a chance to meet this Dr. Walker?

169
00:10:44,055 --> 00:10:44,825
见过
Yeah.

170
00:10:45,975 --> 00:10:47,655
我觉得事态发展遇到些阻碍  丹尼尔
I'm feeling some pushback, Daniel,

171
00:10:47,655 --> 00:10:49,505
而我又忙得很  所以我要的是
and I'm extremely busy, so I need a quick win

172
00:10:49,505 --> 00:10:52,375
-速战速决  行吗  -你说了算
- on this one, OK? - OK.

173
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:53,975
在把沃克交给法拉格特博士之前
I need full intel on Walker

174
00:10:53,975 --> 00:10:56,635
我需要知道她的全部信息
before I return her to Dr. Farragut, and...

175
00:10:57,595 --> 00:11:00,105
说实话  我觉得x宏什么都不会跟我说
well, let's be honest, Hiroshi is not gonna tell me anything.

176
00:11:00,505 --> 00:11:01,855
本来也没什么可说的
There's not much to tell.

177
00:11:04,245 --> 00:11:07,415
我喜欢你  丹尼尔  所以我不希望
I like you, Daniel, and I don't want

178
00:11:07,415 --> 00:11:10,045
咱们的关系一开始  就充斥着你对我的谎言
to start our relationship with you lying to me.

179
00:11:10,525 --> 00:11:12,565
我还没意识到你我之间还有关系可言
I wasn't aware that we had a relationship.

180
00:11:21,195 --> 00:11:23,785
你的忠诚我理解  我甚至十分赞赏
Loyalty I understand. Hell, I even admire it.

181
00:11:24,915 --> 00:11:25,935
所以威胁什么的就不说了
So let's skip the negatives

182
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,595
直接说说好处  如何
and get straight to the positives, shall we?

183
00:11:27,665 --> 00:11:30,215
你的工作做得非常好
You are very good at your job.

184
00:11:30,495 --> 00:11:33,005
而x宏不可能永远做这个基地的负责人
And Hatake is not gonna be in charge of this place forever.

185
00:11:36,015 --> 00:11:38,905
好好想想吧  丹尼尔  行吗
Just think on it, Daniel. Please.

186
00:11:41,475 --> 00:11:44,405
x宏毁掉了他身边所有与他亲近的人
Hiroshi has destroyed everyone who's ever been close to him.

187
00:11:45,725 --> 00:11:47,075
别让他也毁了你
Don't let him do the same to you.

188
00:12:03,885 --> 00:12:04,795
真方便啊
Handy.

189
00:12:05,795 --> 00:12:09,165
美军在北极圈废弃了67个
The U.S. Military abandoned 67 of these early-warning stations

190
00:12:09,165 --> 00:12:12,115
这样的预警站  总得有人用用这些设施吧
across the Arctic. Someone should put them to use.

191
00:12:16,645 --> 00:12:18,095
给我松绑不行吗
How about untying my hands?

192
00:12:19,435 --> 00:12:21,075
你睡觉还得用手吗
You need your hands to sleep?

193
00:12:21,945 --> 00:12:23,165
你反正有枪
You've got the gun.

194
00:12:23,605 --> 00:12:25,325
没错  你说的有道理
Yeah, you make a good point.

195
00:12:27,065 --> 00:12:28,255
我只是想说
I'm just saying.

196
00:12:29,175 --> 00:12:30,415
咱做事儿讲点道理呗
Let's be reasonable.

197
00:12:33,805 --> 00:12:34,735
那好吧
Ok.

198
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,195
好
ok.

199
00:12:41,745 --> 00:12:44,985
讲理的话就得把你的脚也捆上
It's reasonable to hogtie you.

200
00:12:45,825 --> 00:12:47,895
彻底断了你逃跑的念头
Make sure you don't get any ideas about running off.

201
00:12:47,945 --> 00:12:49,075
别这样
Aw, come on!

202
00:12:50,965 --> 00:12:52,005
我得回到上面去
I need to get back upstairs.

203
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:52,995
我得去找艾伦
I need to get to Alan.

204
00:12:52,995 --> 00:12:54,785
我的血液里没准有能对抗病毒的抗体
My blood could have antibodies that fight the virus.

205
00:12:54,795 --> 00:12:55,705
澳大利亚有个人
There's a guy in Australia,

206
00:12:55,705 --> 00:12:57,955
他的血浆拯救了两百万婴儿的生命
his blood plasma has saved 2 million babies.

207
00:12:57,955 --> 00:12:59,835
我们要救的只有四五十人
We only have to save 40 or 50 people.

208
00:13:03,095 --> 00:13:05,095
你要是真的话  整件事就容易多了
This would be so much easier if you were real.

209
00:13:06,305 --> 00:13:09,235
-有我总聊胜于无  -才怪
- I'm better than nothing. - Barely.

210
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:18,675
你和我的银色瞳孔有关联吗
Are you connected to my silver eyes?

211
00:13:19,535 --> 00:13:22,905
-所以我才总会看见你  -这就是你的理论吗
- Is that why I'm seeing you? - Is that your hypothesis?

212
00:13:23,775 --> 00:13:25,935
你知道我讨厌苏格拉底反诘法
You know I've always hated the Socratic method.

213
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:27,865
好吧
Fine.

214
00:13:28,715 --> 00:13:30,845
也许你只是暂时性的畏光
Maybe it's temporary light sensitivity.

215
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:34,285
或者是间歇丛集性头痛
Or non-episodic cluster headaches.

216
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,955
或者你可能快瞎了
Or maybe you're just going blind.

217
00:13:40,845 --> 00:13:42,285
总比死了强
Better than dead, I guess.

218
00:13:45,365 --> 00:13:46,495
又或者
Or maybe...

219
00:13:51,145 --> 00:13:53,035
你是头号幸存者
...maybe you're survivor zero -

220
00:13:54,525 --> 00:13:55,905
第一个被治愈的人
the first one cured.

221
00:13:59,135 --> 00:14:01,625
如果我康复了  怎么还会出现幻觉呢
But if I'm cured, why am I still hallucinating?

222
00:14:03,835 --> 00:14:05,505
更关键的问题是
I have an even better question.

223
00:14:07,295 --> 00:14:09,095
为什么你幻想的是我
Why are you hallucinating me

224
00:14:10,315 --> 00:14:11,715
而不是艾伦呢
instead of Alan?

225
00:14:37,615 --> 00:14:39,295
萨顿想让我背叛你
Sutton is trying to turn me against you.

226
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,145
她当然想这么做
Of course she is.

227
00:14:43,785 --> 00:14:45,025
我就是跟你汇报一声
I just wanted to let you know.

228
00:14:45,445 --> 00:14:47,715
萨顿是个危险的敌人
Sutton can be a dangerous enemy.

229
00:14:51,845 --> 00:14:52,935
我明白
I understand.

230
00:14:53,885 --> 00:14:56,555
不  你不明白
No. You don't.

231
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:01,295
她不会放过任何妨碍她的人
She destroys anything that gets in her way.

232
00:15:02,185 --> 00:15:04,265
她也是这样形容你的
She said something similar about you.

233
00:15:06,295 --> 00:15:08,325
你想从我身上得到什么
What is it you want from me?

234
00:15:10,835 --> 00:15:12,155
你的信任
Your trust.

235
00:15:15,685 --> 00:15:17,195
我在努力保护你
I'm trying to protect you.

236
00:15:20,025 --> 00:15:21,925
不过有件事你可以帮我
But there is one thing you can do.

237
00:15:23,265 --> 00:15:24,905
无论如何
Under no circumstances

238
00:15:24,905 --> 00:15:28,635
绝不能让萨顿接近沃克博士
can Sutton be allowed to gain access to Dr. Walker.

239
00:15:30,695 --> 00:15:33,085
她为什么如此重要
Why is Walker so important?

240
00:15:33,825 --> 00:15:35,155
跟解药有关吗
Is it about the cure?

241
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,685
我根本不关心解药的事
I never cared about the cure.

242
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,495
我以为因为解药才...
But I thought that's why--

243
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:41,355
我请求你的帮助  难道还不足以说明我的信任吗
Is it not enough that I asked for your help?

244
00:15:44,795 --> 00:15:48,545
我认为  萨顿想杀沃克
I think... Sutton will kill Walker.

245
00:15:50,255 --> 00:15:53,525
我不想看到这一幕发生
I do not wish... that outcome.

246
00:16:30,238 --> 00:16:31,828
你得离暖炉近点
You should get closer to the heater.

247
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:38,608
-你真要睡觉吗  -累了当然要睡
- Are you really gonna sleep? - That's what tired people do.

248
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:40,378
真受不了你[葡萄牙语]
Deus caramba.

249
00:16:40,378 --> 00:16:42,778
老天  你连西班牙语都说不对
Jeez, you can't even speak Spanish correctly.

250
00:16:43,948 --> 00:16:45,368
因为我说的是葡萄牙语
That's 'cause it's Portuguese.

251
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:48,278
那不就是蹩脚的西班牙语吗
See? Horrible Spanish.

252
00:16:52,138 --> 00:16:53,238
你的家乡在哪
Where's your home?

253
00:16:54,028 --> 00:16:56,868
圣埃斯皮里图州  就在里约热内卢以北
Espirito Santo. Just north of Rio.

254
00:16:59,868 --> 00:17:04,378
失踪儿童的事  我真的很抱歉
I really am sorry... you know, about the missing kids.

255
00:17:09,448 --> 00:17:13,408
我们从小就被教导不要远离狩猎营地
As a child, we were warned to stay near the hunting camps.

256
00:17:13,618 --> 00:17:15,578
不然就会被凯里帕利抓走
Otherwise, the Qalupalik would take us.

257
00:17:13,618 --> 00:17:15,578
{\an8}因纽特神话中长相似人的蓝色生物

258
00:17:16,338 --> 00:17:17,548
什么帕利
Qalu-who?

259
00:17:17,758 --> 00:17:20,518
一种专偷孩子的妖怪
Boogeyman. Child-stealer.

260
00:17:22,818 --> 00:17:25,498
但长大后我发现原来我的儿时妖怪真的存在
But I grew up and discovered my Boogeyman was real.

261
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:27,568
我也是
Mine too.

262
00:17:29,328 --> 00:17:31,688
圣埃斯皮里图州也有很多失踪儿童吗
A lot of kids go missing in Espirito Santo?

263
00:17:32,438 --> 00:17:33,398
是啊
Yeah.

264
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:43,878
好吧
Fine.

265
00:17:52,748 --> 00:17:53,958
虽然我不喜欢你
I don't like you.

266
00:17:55,098 --> 00:17:57,388
但我对你所经历的那些感到抱歉
But I'm sorry about whatever you went through.

267
00:18:24,178 --> 00:18:25,248
法拉格特博士
Dr. Farragut.

268
00:18:28,238 --> 00:18:29,188
萨顿女士
Ms. Sutton.

269
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,828
叫我康斯坦丝就行
Please, call me Constance.

270
00:18:32,248 --> 00:18:34,318
解药的研究有进展吗
So, how is the search for the cure progressing?

271
00:18:34,368 --> 00:18:36,208
停滞不前  因为沃克博士不在
It isn't, without Dr. Walker.

272
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,008
我以为我们已经达成了共识
I thought we had an understanding.

273
00:18:38,008 --> 00:18:39,378
你负责研究解药
You take care of the lab work,

274
00:18:39,378 --> 00:18:41,098
我负责其余的事
and I will take care of everything else.

275
00:18:41,098 --> 00:18:44,378
恐怕你没有尽职尽责  康斯坦丝
I'm afraid you didn't square the circle on that one, Constance.

276
00:18:49,518 --> 00:18:50,808
计划正在执行中
Plans are in motion.

277
00:18:51,768 --> 00:18:54,428
我的手下很快就会把沃克博士接上来
My security team will be going down to retrieve Dr. Walker very soon.

278
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:56,728
我要和他们一起去
And I'll be going with them.

279
00:18:56,728 --> 00:18:58,898
这恐怕不行  艾伦
I'm afraid that's a non-starter, Alan.

280
00:18:58,908 --> 00:19:00,358
我们不能让你再遭到任何不测
We can't allow anything to happen to you.

281
00:19:00,358 --> 00:19:02,168
沃克博士是我的队员
Dr. Walker is a member of my team.

282
00:19:02,638 --> 00:19:04,248
我需要确保她的安全
I need to guarantee her safety.

283
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:06,478
你好像不太信任我
I'm sensing you have some trust issues.

284
00:19:06,488 --> 00:19:08,158
要是我去不成  那谁也别想去
If I don't go, no one goes.

285
00:19:10,508 --> 00:19:11,288
随便你吧
Suit yourself.

286
00:19:11,288 --> 00:19:14,238
但你必须全程在武装人员保护下行动
But you will have an armed escort at all times.

287
00:19:14,378 --> 00:19:15,918
那再好不过了
I wouldn't have it any other way.

288
00:19:29,018 --> 00:19:30,458
周边警报
Perimeter alert.

289
00:19:32,168 --> 00:19:33,588
周边警报
Perimeter alert.

290
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:36,398
周边警报
Perimeter alert.

291
00:20:03,528 --> 00:20:04,408
米嘉
Miksa.

292
00:20:05,858 --> 00:20:06,828
你为什么会在这
What the hell are you doing here?

293
00:20:06,828 --> 00:20:08,388
你想说我怎么还没死吗
You mean alive?

294
00:20:11,048 --> 00:20:12,148
米嘉
Miksa!

295
00:20:13,538 --> 00:20:15,208
抱着你的感觉都跟以前一样
You even feel like him.

296
00:20:16,908 --> 00:20:17,558
你又是谁
Who the hell are you?

297
00:20:17,558 --> 00:20:19,648
他说过你以为自己叫丹尼尔
He says you think your name is Daniel.

298
00:20:21,298 --> 00:20:22,918
你的名字是米嘉
Your name is Miksa.

299
00:20:24,168 --> 00:20:26,038
你在很小的时候就被他们带走了
You were taken from us as a child.

300
00:20:26,398 --> 00:20:28,508
听着  我不管你以为我是谁
Listen, I don't know who you think I am--

301
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,788
这么多年来我一直在搜寻你的下落
I've been searching for you my entire life.

302
00:20:31,978 --> 00:20:32,758
我的弟弟
My brother.

303
00:20:32,758 --> 00:20:35,408
这算什么  你又在搞什么鬼
What is this? What are you trying to pull?

304
00:20:35,408 --> 00:20:36,668
这跟我可没关系
Don't look at me.

305
00:20:36,688 --> 00:20:38,798
她家里有个长得跟你一模一样的
She's got another one exactly like you back home.

306
00:20:38,898 --> 00:20:40,718
你有一个孪生兄弟
Your brother, your twin!

307
00:20:44,698 --> 00:20:45,868
他叫图克
Tulok.

308
00:21:01,528 --> 00:21:02,458
真不赖
Impressive.

309
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:03,928
但这种照片处理技术我也会
But I can use Photoshop too.

310
00:21:03,928 --> 00:21:07,268
把他带到禁闭室  我来处理这女的
Take him to Isolation. I'll deal with her.

311
00:21:20,618 --> 00:21:23,988
一  二  三  四
One, two, three, four.

312
00:21:24,578 --> 00:21:27,168
到桌子的距离是四步
Four steps to the table.

313
00:21:27,948 --> 00:21:32,798
一  二  三步到柜子
One, two, three steps to the cabinet.

314
00:21:34,508 --> 00:21:37,898
一步到推车  这个可得记住
Ah! One step to the cart. Gotta remember that.

315
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:49,938
x博士  是你吗
Dr. Hatake? Is that you?

316
00:21:51,848 --> 00:21:52,908
彼得
Peter?

317
00:23:14,453 --> 00:23:17,443
很高兴看到你一点儿都没见外
Nice to see you've made yourself at home.

318
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:21,513
茱莉亚・沃克是谁  宏
Hiroshi, who is Julia Walker?

319
00:23:21,763 --> 00:23:22,883
你怎么从未提起过她
Why haven't you mentioned her?

320
00:23:22,883 --> 00:23:23,913
为什么我要这么做
Why would I?

321
00:23:23,913 --> 00:23:27,133
你汇报过那个惨死的兽医朵琳
You briefed us that poor dead veterinarian, Doreen--

322
00:23:27,133 --> 00:23:29,043
沃克无足轻重
Walker seemed unimportant.

323
00:23:29,853 --> 00:23:31,053
可恰恰相反的是
Dr. Farragut seems to think

324
00:23:31,053 --> 00:23:34,463
法拉格特博士认为她至关重要
she's the exact opposite of unimportant.

325
00:23:34,643 --> 00:23:37,043
她是他的前妻
She's his ex-wife.

326
00:23:37,063 --> 00:23:39,783
原来是私人关系  这是他的理由吗
Ah, nepotism. Is that his reasoning?

327
00:23:39,783 --> 00:23:40,993
也许吧
Perhaps.

328
00:23:41,323 --> 00:23:42,813
那你又怎么解释呢
And what is yours?

329
00:23:50,693 --> 00:23:51,933
雇佣考量
Recruiting.

330
00:23:52,323 --> 00:23:55,573
我这里有疾控中心所有科学家的资料
I have files on all CDC scientists.

331
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:57,223
这么说她的确很重要
So she is important.

332
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:01,693
最后我并没有雇佣她  所以不
I chose not to recruit her, so no,

333
00:24:01,693 --> 00:24:03,003
我不认为她很重要.
I don't believe so.

334
00:24:03,003 --> 00:24:04,603
看来我们的看法不尽相同
A difference of opinion then. Good.

335
00:24:05,053 --> 00:24:07,963
是人力资源的问题  我了解了
Human Resources problems I can understand.

336
00:24:10,173 --> 00:24:11,443
听好了  x宏
I'll tell you what, Hiroshi,

337
00:24:11,443 --> 00:24:14,673
我会亲自去R层把沃克博士带回来
I will personally arbitrate Dr. Walker's importance

338
00:24:14,673 --> 00:24:18,883
到时再由我来决定她是否重要
or lack thereof when I go down to Level R and pull her out.

339
00:24:19,503 --> 00:24:20,763
她在哪里
Where is she?

340
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:25,733
她在一间被当做分诊部的实验室
She's in a lab we set up for triage.

341
00:24:26,553 --> 00:24:28,033
R层17号

342
00:24:34,133 --> 00:24:35,463
宏
Hiroshi.

343
00:24:39,703 --> 00:24:41,873
别忘了你是站在哪边的
Let's not forget which side you're on.

344
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:55,343
准许进入
Access granted.

345
00:25:02,433 --> 00:25:03,773
之前用过枪吗
Ever use one of these?

346
00:25:05,513 --> 00:25:06,653
最近才用过
Recently.

347
00:25:12,123 --> 00:25:13,373
法拉格特博士
Dr. Farragut.

348
00:25:14,703 --> 00:25:17,333
要和我们一起去  就得拿上枪
You want to come with us? Take the gun.

349
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:21,743
楼层B  预定清扫
Scheduled cleaning, Level B.

350
00:25:22,963 --> 00:25:25,223
楼层B  预定清扫
Scheduled cleaning, Level B

351
00:25:26,923 --> 00:25:28,593
你真的认为这些人信得过吗
Do you really think you can trust them?

352
00:25:28,853 --> 00:25:31,143
不  但之前我们单独行动时
No, but you saw what happened

353
00:25:31,143 --> 00:25:32,773
你也见识到下面有多危险了
when we went down there alone.

354
00:25:33,813 --> 00:25:35,453
如今正好有这么多武力
All these guns around -

355
00:25:35,723 --> 00:25:37,843
何不好好利用一下呢
might as well use them to get what we want.

356
00:25:38,643 --> 00:25:40,083
去把茱莉亚带回来
Go get Julia,

357
00:25:40,283 --> 00:25:43,233
拜托了  这样我们才能尽快回家
please, so that we can all go home.

358
00:25:45,123 --> 00:25:46,553
拜耶塞罗
Balleseros.

359
00:25:50,353 --> 00:25:51,733
法拉格特博士
Doctor Farragut!

360
00:25:52,273 --> 00:25:54,563
法拉格特博士
Doctor Farragut!

361
00:25:54,563 --> 00:25:55,993
快住手  住手
Please! Stop! Stop it!

362
00:25:55,993 --> 00:25:58,323
就是他杀了博伊尔博士
That man killed Dr. Boyle!

363
00:25:59,283 --> 00:26:00,533
军队...
The army en--

364
00:26:01,103 --> 00:26:03,213
你居然杀了一名
You killed a member of the CDC

365
00:26:03,213 --> 00:26:06,093
帮我们寻找解药的疾控中心成员吗
who's trying to find a cure for this virus?

366
00:26:06,093 --> 00:26:08,193
我向你保证  他会付出代价的
I promise you, I will make this man pay.

367
00:26:08,263 --> 00:26:09,123
你现在没有时间精力
You have neither the time

368
00:26:09,123 --> 00:26:11,653
浪费在这种事上面  但我有
nor the wherewithal to handle this right now. I do.

369
00:26:12,623 --> 00:26:15,423
-这事与你无关  -没错  但如果我的协助
- This is not your concern. - No, but if my men handle this,

370
00:26:15,433 --> 00:26:16,773
能让你更快地回到实验当中
that puts you back in the lab faster,

371
00:26:16,773 --> 00:26:18,723
那我义不容辞
and that is very much my concern.

372
00:26:40,393 --> 00:26:41,393
让我和囚犯单独待会
Give me a minute with the prisoner,

373
00:26:41,393 --> 00:26:43,843
做好R层攻入与拯救行动的准备
and get ready for Level R insertion and retrieval.

374
00:26:45,183 --> 00:26:46,903
-长官  -解散
- Ma'am. - Dismissed.

375
00:27:07,143 --> 00:27:08,253
我操
Shit.

376
00:27:08,783 --> 00:27:09,643
这是为了什么
What was that for?

377
00:27:10,943 --> 00:27:12,443
你杀掉了研发解药
You murdered 25%

378
00:27:12,443 --> 00:27:14,893
所需人力的四分之一
of the workflow we need for the cure.

379
00:27:14,893 --> 00:27:18,183
那我杀了四分之一的你怎么样
How about I kill 25% of you?

380
00:27:18,443 --> 00:27:19,703
别这样  康斯坦丝
Come on, Constance.

381
00:27:19,703 --> 00:27:20,753
是萨顿女士
Ms. Sutton.

382
00:27:24,973 --> 00:27:26,363
我雇你来是干什么的
What am I paying you for?

383
00:27:26,993 --> 00:27:28,633
病毒  解药
Virus. Cure.

384
00:27:28,633 --> 00:27:30,733
错  那是诶拉瑞亚集团雇你的原因
Wrong. That is what Ilaria pays you for.

385
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:32,043
而我呢
I, on the other hand,

386
00:27:32,043 --> 00:27:33,453
是让你给我找出
tasked you with finding me proof

387
00:27:33,453 --> 00:27:35,753
x宏叛变的证据
that Hatake has gone off the rails.

388
00:27:37,053 --> 00:27:39,723
你上次报告的时候  说发现了什么是吗
The last time you checked in, you said you were on to something.

389
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:40,913
抱歉让你失望了
Sorry to disappoint you.

390
00:27:40,913 --> 00:27:42,893
最近我都在忙着保住自己的小命
I've been a little busy trying not to get killed.

391
00:27:42,903 --> 00:27:45,813
所以除了这烂借口你什么都没有了吗
So you have nothing except excuses?

392
00:27:45,823 --> 00:27:47,553
还有个被捅了一刀的脾脏
And a perforated spleen.

393
00:27:47,903 --> 00:27:50,953
x宏的问题是你一手造成的
You created the Hatake situation.

394
00:27:51,033 --> 00:27:53,423
别把责任都赖给我
Don't you blame me for your mess.

395
00:27:54,953 --> 00:27:56,783
我就喜欢你这点  塞尔吉
That's why I like you, Serge.

396
00:27:58,363 --> 00:27:59,833
你要么是非常勇敢
You're either very brave

397
00:27:59,833 --> 00:28:03,543
要么就是非常非常的愚蠢
or very... very foolish.

398
00:28:04,053 --> 00:28:05,483
显然  我两者皆有
Apparently, both.

399
00:28:22,353 --> 00:28:24,393
白痴再勇敢  依旧还是白痴
A brave fool is still a fool.

400
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:45,248
你是准备帮我把衣服脱了呢
So, are you gonna take these off,

401
00:28:45,248 --> 00:28:47,518
还是说我仍在受处罚中
or am I still in a time-out?

402
00:28:49,618 --> 00:28:51,448
我需要艾伦做我的盟友
I need Alan as an ally.

403
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:53,058
而放了你是毁掉这个同盟
Releasing you will be the quickest way

404
00:28:53,058 --> 00:28:56,038
-的最快方式  -你在开玩笑吧
- to screw that up. - You're kidding, right?

405
00:28:56,938 --> 00:28:59,758
我是会开玩笑的人吗
Do I ever kid?

406
00:28:59,758 --> 00:29:02,288
-那我就这么待着  -先待着吧
- So I stay? - So you stay.

407
00:29:02,298 --> 00:29:04,088
再说我也怀疑你是否能在
Plus, I'm not sure you would survive

408
00:29:04,088 --> 00:29:06,448
碰到丹尼尔那家伙后还能活下来
an encounter with that Daniel character.

409
00:29:07,188 --> 00:29:08,938
我该感谢你对我的肯定吗
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

410
00:29:09,778 --> 00:29:11,438
如果我是你
Oh, now, if I were you,

411
00:29:11,618 --> 00:29:13,468
我会把这
I would think that my...

412
00:29:14,188 --> 00:29:16,578
销魂的一吻
soft kisses...

413
00:29:19,418 --> 00:29:21,468
当成对你最大的肯定
...are all the vote I needed.

把他关进禁闭室
Throw him in isolation.

418
00:29:47,878 --> 00:29:49,138
你去哪里了
Where were you?

419
00:29:49,268 --> 00:29:50,768
发生了什么
What happened here?

420
00:29:54,088 --> 00:29:57,068
-是其他的科学家吗  -不  是个带菌者
- Was it the other scientists? - No, a vector.

421
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:00,358
你受伤了吗
Are you hurt?

422
00:30:00,678 --> 00:30:02,068
它就在这  就在我眼前
It was here, right in front of me,

423
00:30:02,068 --> 00:30:07,028
蓄势待发  可然后  它...
ready to attack, and then it just... and then... it just...

424
00:30:07,328 --> 00:30:08,108
突然就停手了
stopped.

425
00:30:08,108 --> 00:30:12,218
沃克博士  你看起来  好多了
Dr. Walker, you look... better.

426
00:30:13,018 --> 00:30:16,848
我还活着  身体健康  就是可能有点精神失常
Alive. Healthy. Possibly going crazy. All of the above.

427
00:30:17,718 --> 00:30:18,748
这真是太好了
This is wonderful.

428
00:30:18,748 --> 00:30:21,048
除了精神失常  这最好不是真的
Yeah, except for the crazy part. Could do without that.

429
00:30:21,518 --> 00:30:24,988
我需要抽检血样  做个诊断性测试
I'll need to draw blood. Run diagnostic tests.

430
00:30:24,988 --> 00:30:26,808
我已经做了所有的测试
I've already done all the tests.

431
00:30:26,808 --> 00:30:28,358
没有病毒的迹象  只是
There's no sign of the virus. The only thing-Ah!

432
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,138
我的眼睛好疼
Ah, my eyes hurt!

433
00:30:31,758 --> 00:30:35,428
我的眼睛不知道怎么了  看什么都模糊
There's something happening to my eyes. Everything's blurry.

434
00:30:44,228 --> 00:30:45,338
坐在这
Sit here.

435
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:50,788
我给你用绷带绑起来
Let me get you some bandages.

436
00:31:06,578 --> 00:31:07,828
闭上眼睛
Close your eyes.

437
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:31,888
你还好吗
Are you okay?

438
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:43,718
E层
Level E.

439
00:31:47,228 --> 00:31:50,798
据报告  这些带菌者非常敏捷强壮
My sit-reps indicate these vectors are fast and strong?

440
00:31:50,938 --> 00:31:53,188
-F层  -绝对超乎你想象
- Level F. - Like nothing you've ever seen.

441
00:31:53,888 --> 00:31:55,098
其他人呢
And the others?

442
00:31:55,398 --> 00:31:59,598
普通人而已  他们感染了纳尔维克-A病毒
Human. Suffering prolonged and fatal cellular breakdown

443
00:31:59,598 --> 00:32:00,908
只能在底下痛苦地等死
due to the NARVIK-A strain.

444
00:32:00,908 --> 00:32:02,778
-E层  -或者还没病变就被咬死了
- Level E. - Or not suffering at all.

445
00:32:02,958 --> 00:32:04,698
你说过下面还有未感染的人是吗
You said there were healthy people down there as well?

446
00:32:04,698 --> 00:32:07,778
当时未感染  现在就不好说了
There were. Now I don't know.

447
00:32:08,708 --> 00:32:09,978
R层
Level R.

448
00:32:15,688 --> 00:32:16,398
佩雷斯  你打头

R-17号实验室在哪里
Lab R-17?

452
00:32:30,338 --> 00:32:31,608
应该是这边
This way, I think.

453
00:32:32,298 --> 00:32:34,738
-都听到他说的了  行动  -收到

你现在能走吗
Can you walk?

455
00:32:42,968 --> 00:32:45,388

00:32:46,328 --> 00:32:49,228
-我们得离开这  -为什么
- We need to leave this place. - Why?

457
00:32:49,238 --> 00:32:52,088
有个女人要来杀你
There is a woman coming down here to kill you.

458
00:32:52,098 --> 00:32:56,108
-你到底在说什么  -以后我会解释清楚的

- Does Alan know about this? - He's coming down with her.

461
00:33:01,928 --> 00:33:03,428
艾伦绝不会
Alan would never --

462
00:33:03,428 --> 00:33:07,238
他不知道她做得出什么  但我知道
He doesn't know what she's capable of. I do.

463
00:33:09,628 --> 00:33:10,948
你得跟我走
You have to come with me.

464

- No. I want to wait for Alan. - If you do...

465
00:33:15,738 --> 00:33:16,968

你要相信我
You have to trust me.

Alan, wait a moment.

472
00:34:06,388 --> 00:34:09,068
攻进去  单发射击  不要连击
Make entry. Single shots, no bursts.

473
00:34:09,068 --> 00:34:12,118
-沃克博士很重要  -听我口令
- Dr. Walker's precious cargo. - On my mark.

474
00:34:17,568 --> 00:34:19,518
准备  进攻
Ready... breach!

475
00:34:21,808 --> 00:34:22,718
小心
Look out!

476
00:34:43,276 --> 00:34:44,406
小心后面
Behind us!

477
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:03,696
全员撤退  快
Full retreat! Let's go! Go!

478
00:35:05,196 --> 00:35:06,466
撤退
Fall back!

479
00:35:11,176 --> 00:35:13,086
-菲利普被抓住了  -别管他了
- Philip's down! - Leave him.

480
00:35:26,956 --> 00:35:28,336
我要去找茱莉亚
I have to find Julia.

481
00:35:28,456 --> 00:35:30,476
她不再是原来的她了  她已经和他们一样了
She's not in there. She's one of them now.

482
00:35:30,477 --> 00:35:32,476
那我也不会把她丢在这
I'm not leaving her down here.

483
00:35:32,476 --> 00:35:35,116
难道你感染或者死掉就能救她了吗
How is getting yourself infected or killed gonna help her?

484
00:35:35,536 --> 00:35:37,636
我也不知道  但我不能丢下她不管
I don't know, but I can't leave her behind.

485
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,406
我们得先回到楼上
We have to get back upstairs.

486
00:35:39,406 --> 00:35:41,436
带上足够的人手和武器再回来
Then we come back down with more security, bigger numbers.

487
00:35:41,436 --> 00:35:43,126
否则我们就是来送死
Otherwise we're sitting ducks.

488
00:35:59,266 --> 00:36:00,646
我自己去找茱莉亚
I'm going to find Julia.

489
00:36:00,866 --> 00:36:03,086
你还没弄清形势是吗
You still don't understand how this works, do you?

490
00:36:03,086 --> 00:36:06,456
-回电梯那去  -我刚刚才救了你一命
- Get to the elevator. - I just saved your life.

491
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:07,716
我也很感激
And I am extremely appreciative,

492
00:36:07,716 --> 00:36:10,226
但我得保护我的投资
but right now I have to protect my investment.

493
00:36:10,416 --> 00:36:14,006
靠对着它开一枪吗  尽管动手吧
By putting a bullet through it? Go ahead.

494
00:36:14,006 --> 00:36:15,526
如果你非要去送死  最后变成
If it's the difference between shooting you now

495
00:36:15,526 --> 00:36:18,146
他们其中一员  那朝你开枪只是迟早的事
and shooting you later when you're one of them, then fine,

496
00:36:18,916 --> 00:36:20,836
不过到时候  我就得朝咱们的莎拉
although I will need to put a bullet

497
00:36:20,836 --> 00:36:24,226
也来上一枪  免得走漏风声
through young Sarah as well. Loose ends.

498
00:36:29,516 --> 00:36:31,826
保护法拉格特博士回B层

他去世了  母亲也是
He's dead; mother too.

504
00:36:58,386 --> 00:37:01,066
-你叫我什么来着  -米嘉
- And what did you call me? - Miksa.

505
00:37:01,926 --> 00:37:03,856
那是我们祖父的名字
It was our grandfather's name.

506
00:37:16,396 --> 00:37:17,896
我为什么要相信你
And why should I believe you?

507
00:37:18,776 --> 00:37:20,046
你说的这一切
Any of this?

508
00:37:20,676 --> 00:37:22,246
我为什么要骗你呢
Why would I lie?

509
00:37:22,666 --> 00:37:25,896
-x博士有很多敌人  -x宏
- Dr. Hatake has many enemies. - Hatake?

510
00:37:26,906 --> 00:37:30,176
他是始作俑者  是他偷走了你
He's responsible. He's the one that stole you,

511
00:37:30,176 --> 00:37:33,126
-你和其他小孩  -其他小孩

512
00:37:33,406 --> 00:37:35,846
这些年来一共有31个孩子失踪
Thirty-one children over the years.

513
00:37:37,986 --> 00:37:39,646
你对他们有印象吗
Do you remember any of them?

514
00:37:43,056 --> 00:37:44,676
过去这里总有孩子出现
There were always children here.

515
00:37:47,536 --> 00:37:48,946
但我也没多想
I thought it was normal.

516
00:37:51,746 --> 00:37:53,076
他们都去哪了
What happened to them?

517
00:37:55,926 --> 00:37:57,056
我不知道
I don't know.

518
00:38:00,646 --> 00:38:02,166
还是说你不想知道
Maybe you didn't want to know.

519
00:38:16,696 --> 00:38:19,286
-我们在哪里  -楼上
