此次会议的目的
this is a meeting to allow you to inform me

94
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,560
是向两位询问  是否有任何舰队成员
if any member of the crew has acted towards you

95
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,120
以任何形式冒犯了你们

96
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,070
或是任何你们姐妹团的其他女性
or to the other female members of your rack,

97
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,690
或者以任何形式
or in a manner contrary...

98
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,750
违反海军的管理条例
to the rules and regulations of Navy policy.

99
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,910
你既然要负责敏感问题
But how are you--how are you supposed to

100
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,250
那为什么还会叫我们姐妹团
do sensitivity duty and you all talking about "Racks"?

101
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,050
回答问题  科泰兹
Just answer the question, Cortez.

102
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,520
没有人冒犯  打扰  骚扰
No one has offended, bothered, copped a feel,

103
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,120
或是调戏任何一位姐妹团成员
or otherwise molested any member of my rack.

104
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,770
不过我真喜欢每周聊这些

106
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,010
不对不对  兄弟  听着
No, no, no, no, man, look.

107
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,430
他的音乐就像这样...
He's like, he's like...

108
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,880
-就是一种感觉  伙计  不是理智  -真傻
- It's a feeling, V. It's not intellectual. - Stupid.

109
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,920
你是亚利桑那州来的吧
No, I mean, look, you're-- you're from Arizona, right?

110
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,490
没错
Yeah.

111
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,490
好吧  我无意冒犯
Okay, I'm not even being offensive,

112
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,380
我还有个表亲就住在图森
'cause I got a cousin from Tucson...

113
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,970
但你根本不懂他的音乐
But it just means that you have no idea what he's doing.

114
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:21,670
我不懂?
I have no idea?

115
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,670
没错  在你眼中他完全不入流
No. You think he's all "Ho this" And "Bitch that"...

116
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,570
我可没这么说
That's not what I said.

117
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,530
但其实不是的  其实
And it's just not the case. It's just not the...

118
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,800
不是吧  你们还没扯完啊
Really? Are you guys still at this?

119
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,880
副舰长  我申请
X.O., permission to shoot

120
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,470
一枪打穿布兰伦士官的脑袋
petty Officer Brannan in the head.

121
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,150
批准了
Permission granted.

122
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,360
这可能是我们会遇到的最像真实战争的事情了
Closest thing to an actual engagement we'll probably ever see,

123
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,500
他居然让她指挥
and he gives her the conn?

124
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,180
就那么轻易移交给她
Just hands it over,

125
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,960
"来吧  宝贝儿  好好乐一把哦"
like "Here you go, sweetheart. You have fun with that."

126
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,900
作为海军上将的千金可真好啊
Yeah, nice being an admiral's kid.

127
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,960
"舰长哥哥  我真的能开这艘小船船吗"
"Oh, captain, are you really gonna let me drive the boat?"

128
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,640
长官
Ma'am.

129
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,550
副舰长  舰长让你完事后去舰长室找他
X.O., captain wants to see you in his quarters when you're done.

130
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,690
副舰长接管指挥台
X.O. on the conn.

131
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,930
副舰长接管指挥台
X.O. on the conn.

132
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,920
你手下的劳伦斯和斯特恩
Your guys Lawrence and Stern,

133
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,900
他们在背后嘲讽格蕾丝
they're busting Grace's balls.

134
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,100
我不知情  长官
I wasn't aware of the presence of those, sir.

135
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,480
我会处理好的
Consider it taken care of.

136
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,330
谢谢
Thank you.

137
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,480
请进
Come in.

138
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,470
杰弗里怎么样啊
How's Jeffrey doing?

139
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,030
你肯定很骄傲吧
You must be proud.

140
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,870
是啊  他说他嫉妒我
Yeah, he says he's jealous of me,

141
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,670
能天天待在水里
being surrounded by water.

142
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,190
估计他那儿特别缺水吧
Guess it's pretty dry where they are.

143
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,170
凯姆伦正在追踪那舰队
Listen, Cameron's been tracking the fleet.

144
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,700
做他专长的事情呢
He's doing that thing that he does.

145
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,440
你有艾森豪威尔号攻击群改变航向的消息吗
What do you know about the Eisenhower Group changing course?

146
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,960
这是刚播出的新闻
Here's the latest surface grab

147
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,820
华府乱成一团了
D.C. is falling apart.

148
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,420
四名上将辞职以示抗议
Four generals resigned in protest,

149
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,470
声称总统的新政策是鲁莽而不负责任的
calling the president's policies reckless and irresponsible.

150
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,080
随着弹劾投票的迫近
As the impeachment vote approaches,

151
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,410
四面楚歌的总统...
the embattled president...

152
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,140
罗纳德・里根
Ronald Reagan

153
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,550
把所有空中交通管制员都解雇了
fires all the air traffic controllers.

154
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,850
他的手下都找到他问道
And his guys come to him, and they say,

155
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,180
"总统阁下  你为什么要这么做
"Mr. President, why did you go and do such a thing?

156
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,880
所有人都会认为你疯了"
Everyone's gonna think you're crazy."

157
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,100
而里根
And Reagan...

158
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,560
他指着总统办公室里
He points out the window of the Oval Office

159
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,620
面向俄罗斯的窗户
toward Russia,

160
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,880
他说  "这就对了
and he says, "That's right.

161
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,530
这正是我想让那混蛋认为的情况"
That's exactly what I need that bastard to think."

162
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,950
我们庆祝什么呢
Uh, what are we celebrating?

163
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,980
每个人都认为勃列日涅夫是个疯子
You see, everyone knew Brezhnev was crazy.

164
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,460
勃列日涅夫:1960年任苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席
阿富汗战争的发动者

165
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,710
他入侵了阿富汗
Hell, he invaded Afghanistan.

166
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,120
问题在于
The problem was,

167
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,960
没有人知道里根是否如此
nobody knew if Reagan was.

168
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,750
但是要想成为大权在握的人
And if there's one absolute truth to being the man

169
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,520
绝对要做到的一点
with your finger on the button,

170
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,690
就是要如此
that's it.

171
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,760
他们得认为你疯了
They have to think you're crazy.

172
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,490
这杯敬置身水下五百英尺
Here's to being 500 feet under

173
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,100
并且暂时远离这一切
and half a world away from it all.

174
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
威尔・弗瑞尔斯正在为弗吉尼亚州海军司令部
Will Frears is looking for a second

175
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
寻找一名副手
at Naval Command, Virginia.

176
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,100
我举荐了你
I recommended you.

177
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,950
我们回去后你可以和克里斯蒂待一周
You can take a week with Christine once we get back

178
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,130
然后就做好调动吧
and make the move.

179
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,020
马库斯
Marcus..

180
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,810
山姆  不管你认为是否对我有所亏欠
Whatever you think you owe me, Sam,

181
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,830
你早已经百倍地还我了
you've paid a hundred times over.

182
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,620
你的妻子还等着你呢
You have a wife.

183
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,250
回家吧  做份文职
Go home. Take a desk.

184
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,190
要个孩子
Start a family.

185
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,350
水手长
Chief of the boat.

186
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,950
听着  格蕾丝
Listen, Grace, um...

187
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,240
劳伦斯和斯特恩
Lawrence and Stern,

188
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,920
他们正在接受一周打扫厕所的惩罚
they'll be pulling latrine duty for a week.

189
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,720
我只希望你知道  这不是因为你是女人
I just hope you understand it's not about you being a woman.

190
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,160
他们对我毫无敬意
I just haven't earned their respect.

191
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,060
他们两个负责打扫两周厕所
- Well...  - Two weeks latrine duty for both of them,

192
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,600
水手长  称呼我时请用军衔或者长官
and, C.O.B., you address me by my rank or ma'am,

193
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,000
而不是我的名
not my first name.

194
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,190
谢帕德上尉  汇报当前位置
Lieutenant Shepard, position report.

195
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,520
长官  斯里兰卡西南方向1012公里
1,012 clicks south west of Sri Lanka, sir.

196
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,260
穿越赤道时间为
Crossing the equator in...

197
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,900
现在正在穿越赤道  长官
Oh, crossing now, sir.

198
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,930
格蕾丝  第一次在舰艇上穿越赤道吧
First time crossing the equator on a warship, Gracie?

199
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,110
长官
Sir.

200
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,170
回各自战位
Battle station.

201
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,300
长官  我已解密导弹发射命令
Sir, I have a decoded missile fire order

202
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,800
发自国防部南极紧急司令部
from D.O.D. Emergency Antarctic Network.

203
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,060
南极
Antarctica?

204
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,270
鉴定命令
Authenticate the order.

205
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,130
发射命令
Fire order.

206
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,090
鉴别代码
Authentication code

207
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:03,810
VZZC  MYXW
Victor-zulu-zulu-Charlie, Mike-yankee-X-ray-whiskey-

208
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,780
ZDDK
zulu-delta-delta-kilo.

209
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,860
代码确认无误
The order's authenticated.

210
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,840
我同意
I concur.

211
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,670
老天啊
Sweet mother of God.

212
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,200
他们不应该用南极司令部
They shouldn't be using the Antarctica network.

213
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,160
他们用它时只可能因为
They would only do that if--

214
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,250
华府在攻击中被完全摧毁
If the main one was taken out by a full strike.

215
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,670
准备发射
Weapons conn,

216
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,830
我们收到确认后的发射命令
we have an authenticated fire order.

217
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,470
导弹一到四号准备发射
Spin up missiles one through four.

218
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,620
准备发射  我是副舰长
Weapons, this is the X.O.

219
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,070
我同意舰长命令
I concur with the captain.

220
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,530
转舵  操020度
Helm, come to heading 0-2-0.

221
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,160
到达导弹发射深度
Come to missile firing depth.

222
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,250
发射准备 目标锁定
Conn, weapons. Targets locked.

223
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,020
导弹自旋预备
Missiles spinning up.

224
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:44,790
副舰长
X.O...

225
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,100
将钥匙插入点火装置
Insert your key into the firing station.

226
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,250
我们都在想那个问题  说出来吧
We're both thinking it. Go ahead and say it.

227
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,280
为什么是南极司令部
Why the Antarctic Network?

228
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,340
他们只有在华府司令部被毁了
They'd only use it if D.C. Command was gone

229
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,190
或者不能使用的时候才会用它
or it was rendered inoperable.

230
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,950
舰长  让我们再看一下
Captain, let's just take a look.

231
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,380
通讯部门  推出天线
Communications, roll out the antenna.

232
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,810
让我们看一下
Get us something to look at.

233
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,310
长官  发射已被批准了
Sir, we're cleared to fire.

234
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,320
接通国家司令部
Get me national command.

235
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,260
长官  你会打破无线电静默
Sir, you break radio silence,

236
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,070
这直接违反了操作规程
we're in direct contradiction to procedure.

237
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,590
知道了
Noted.

238
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,670
克利斯  接通通话
Get 'em on the horn, Chris.

239
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:49,040
美军舰科罗拉多号舰长  这里是国家司令部
U.S.S. "Colorado" Command, this is National Command.

240
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,670
我是美军舰科罗拉多号舰长
This is captain Marcus Chaplin,

241
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,900
马库斯・查普林
U.S.S. "Colorado."

242
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,630
我通过南极后备司令部
I have an authenticated fire order

243
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,630
收到了确认后的发射命令
through the Antarctic secondary network.

244
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,600
我舰请求通过
Requesting confirmation of the order

245
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,210
标准紧急行动通讯网络发送命令确认
through the standard E.A.M. Network.

246
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,260
舰长  你已经收到确认的发射命令了
Captain, you have an authenticated fire order.

247
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,350
我知道
I'm aware of that.

248
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,500
请通过正规频道再次发送
Now send it through the proper channel.

249
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,570
我们为什么不发射
Why aren't we firing?

250
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,640
这是上级直接下达的命令  长官
It's a direct order, sir.

251
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,600
舰长  你要抗命不尊吗
Captain, are you refusing the order?

252
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,650
听着  不管你是谁
Listen, whoever the hell you are,

253
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,130
我没有接到宣战的指令
I don't have a declaration of war

254
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,450
而且我不明白为什么这个命令
and I see no reason for this order

255
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,500
来自备用频道
to come through a secondary channel,

256
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,940
我们都知道它存在的目的
which we all know was designed only to be used in the event

257
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,120
只是在华府司令部被摧毁时使用
that D.C. Command was wiped out.

258
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,510
但我现在在电视上看到了汉娜・蒙塔纳的节目
But I'm sitting here watching "Hannah Montana,"

259
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:28,470
你去把有权力下达这个命令的人叫来
so I'm not going to annihilate 4.3 million Pakistanis

260
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,740
否则我绝不会屠杀
without hearing directly from someone

261
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,160
430万巴基斯坦民众
whose authority I recognize.

262
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,560
给我接通管事的人
Get me someone I can talk to.

263
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,580
科罗拉多号  通讯结束
"Colorado" Out.

264
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,270
美军舰科罗拉多号
The U.S.S "Colorado"--

265
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,770
俄亥俄级核潜艇
Ohio class nuclear submarine,

266
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,170
舰上一百五十名男性
150 men on board.

267
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,650
事实上  从去年起
Actually, since last year,

268
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:55,750
还有九名女兵以及两位女性军官
nine enlisted women and two female officers as well.

269
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:00,520
这使它充满了力量
It makes its own air power.

270
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:04,890
它拥有四枚MK48鱼雷发射管
It's got four mark 48 torpedo tubes,

271
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,670
二十八枚战斧式导弹
28 Tomahawks,

272
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:09,140
和十八枚三叉戟核弹
and 18 Trident nuclear missiles,

273
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,450
它基本上可以摧毁任何东西
which can basically wipe out anything,

274
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,910
在任何地方  任何时间
anywhere, anytime.

275
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,350
天哪  我喜欢你谈论军事装备的样子
God, I love it when you talk military hardware.

276
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,170
是的  我知道  我很棒  对吧
Yeah, I know. I'm good, right?

277
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,090
但是呢  科罗拉多号有个和你一样的毛病
But see, the "Colorado" Has the same problem you do.

278
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,000
太有"吸引力"了
Magnetism.

279
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,330
像那么一艘大块头潜艇
Big sexy boat like that,

280
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,820
必然有特殊的磁场特征
it has its own magnetic signature,

281
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:41,150
磁场特征: 因舰体金属材质扰乱了地球磁场而形成
易被敌舰探测到或易受磁性水雷攻击

282
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,430
让这艘造价四十亿美元的潜艇
which turns a $4-billion sub

283
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,060
变成了活靶子
into a sitting duck.

284
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,280
而现在艇上装上了老娘的样机
Except now with the prototype I've put on board,

285
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,150
再也不会暴露磁场特征了
no signature.

286
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,320
海军军方早就对这项技术垂涎三尺了
The Navy is already drooling over this thing.

287
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,750
明天测试以后  他们肯定要大批订货
And after tomorrow's test, they're gonna want lots of them.

288
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:52,750
这就要用到你那个参议员了
That is where your senator comes in.

289
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,600
我没法儿拒绝你
Who can say no to you?

290
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,510
你敢...别接
Oh, don't you... dare. No.

291
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,100
不
No.

292
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,110
不不不
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

293
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,300
你来真的吗
You can't be serious.

294
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,010
472 查普林  是个地址吗
What's "472 Chaplin"? Is that an address?

295
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:10,710
不是
No.

296
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:13,330
-别告诉我你今晚又要开会  -不是
- Tell me you don't have another meeting tonight.  - No.

297
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,420
相信我罗伯特
Trust me, Robert,

298
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,920
我其实哪里都不想去
there is nowhere I would rather be,

299
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,350
什么事什么人都不想见
and nothing and no one I would rather be doing,

300
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,460
但我得走了
but I've gotta go.

301
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:21,290
这...
Hey, this...

302
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,290
这可是你的公寓啊
This is your apartment.

303
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,450
我是马库斯・查普林舰长
Captain Marcus Chaplin.

304
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:46,620
舰长  我是国防部副部长威廉・科利
Captain, this is Deputy Secretary of Defense William Curry.

305
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,020
我们大概一年前在第二潜艇集团军演中见过
We met about a year ago at a CSG2 event.

306
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,790
你能听出我的声音吗
Do you recognize my voice?

307
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,020
能  长官
I do, sir.

308
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,640
不过为何不是部长本人
Although, why isn't the secretary himself

309
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,710
或者总统听电话呢
or the president on the line?

310
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,140
马库斯・查普林舰长
Captain Marcus Chaplin,

311
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,470
根据海军军规第472条
you are relieved of your command

312
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,170
你现被免除指挥权
under section 472 of the naval code.

313
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:03,120
请将电话递给你的大副
Please pass me to your first officer.

314
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,440
我是科罗拉多号副舰长山姆・肯德尔
This is "Colorado" X.O. Sam Kendal.

315
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,860
肯德尔少校
Lieutenant Commander Kendal,

316
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,670
从现在起你被晋升为潜艇舰长
as of this moment, you are advanced to Captain of the Boat.

317
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,310
你接到了准许开火命令  对吗
You have an authorized fire order, do you not?

318
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:34,590
对  长官
Affirmative, sir.

319
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,270
谢帕德上尉
Lieutenant Shepard,

320
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,250
请取走查普林舰长点火装置的钥匙
take the firing key from Captain Chaplin

321
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,120
并插入点火装置中
and insert it into the firing computer.

322
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,130
科利长官  我是代理舰长山姆・肯德尔
Mr. Curry, this is the acting Captain Sam Kendal.

323
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,670
请求通过正规的
Request that you send the order

324
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:20,950
紧急行动通讯频道下达命令 长官
via the regular E.A.M. Channel, sir.

325
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,140
好  舰长
Okay, Captain.

326
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,590
请待命
Stand by.

327
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,120
通讯被切断了  长官
Line's dead, sir.

328
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:26,900
这到底怎么回事
What the hell's going on here?

329
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,400
为什么船员都在说你们拒绝执行命令
Why is the crew talking about you refusing orders?

330
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,330
水手长  请让这些人离开指挥台
Chief of the Boat, remove these men from the conn.

331
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,620
除非亲眼见到命令  否则我哪儿也不去
I'm not going anywhere till I see those orders.

332
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,200
凭什么  你有资格吗
You have no authority here. This is my boat.

333
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,190
敢在老子的地盘上撒野  给我滚出指挥台
So get your ass off this conn now.

334
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,360
听不懂舰长的命令吗
You heard the man.

335
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,390
我们看不到那条命令决不罢休
There's no way we're not seeing that order.

336
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,460
你们无权看那条命令
They are not your orders to see.

337
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,730
我本以为你们海豹突击队员该聪明点
I thought you SEAL boys were supposed to be smart.

338
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,690
在潜艇里开枪可不是闹着玩的
Bullets and submarines don't get along so well.

339
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,910
没事  舰长  我们从来弹无虚发
That's okay, Captain. We don't miss.

340
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:55,380
长官  有巡航导弹向我方袭来
Sir, I have inbound cruise missile on our position!

341
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,210
老天啊  还剩二十秒
Oh, my God. 20 seconds out.

342
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,690
紧急下潜
Emergency deep!

343
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:01,580
全体船员注意  紧急下潜  紧急下潜
All hands! Emergency deep! Emergency deep!

344
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,240
-右满舵  -抓牢了
- Right full rudder! - Grab on to something.

345
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,350
还有十秒
Ten seconds out.

346
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:07,730
下潜至海底  抓紧了
Point us at the bottom. Hold on!

347
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,520
炸弹来了
Here it comes!

348
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,600
迅速拉起潜艇
Bring us up!

349
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,480
不行  推进系统失灵
Negative! Control surfaces are nonresponsive.

350
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:24,470
系统重启中
Rebooting the system.

351
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,090
全体船员注意  船舱进水
All hands, we have water in the boat!

352
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,490
撤离前部船舱
Evacuate forward compartment.

353
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,540
封闭副发动机室  封闭医务室
Seal auxiliary engine. Seal sick bay.

354
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,940
医务室  霍普还在那里
Hey, sick bay? Hopper.

355
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,310
等等  医务室先别封  我到那去关
Wait! Hold sick bay. I'll do it on-site.

356
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,020
系统恢复正常
We're back online.

357
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,080
-紧急上浮  -压载舱强行排水
- Emergency blow. - Blowing tanks.

358
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,630
即将撞击海底
Bottom approaching!

359
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,430
五十英尺
50 feet!

360
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,870
四十  三十  快要撞到了
40. 30. We're going in.

361
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,710
全体船员注意  准备撞击
All hands, brace for impact!

362
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:28,090
组织营救小组怎么样
What about an extraction team?

363
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:31,630
太深了  我们正处一千五六百英尺深处
Too deep! We're 1,500, maybe 1,600 feet down!

364
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,790
潜艇自救的理论深度  只有一千三百英尺
Hull's only rated to 1,300.

365
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,580
我们得马上撤出去
We gotta leave right now!

366
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,090
我带上霍普随后就来
We're right behind you with Hopper.

367
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,720
吉尔
Gil!

368
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,420
快点  帮我把它关上
Come on! Help me close this!

369
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,830
不是我们的设备失灵
We're not having a malfunction of our equipment yet.

370
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,440
不  听我说
No, excuse me.

371
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,790
这明显就是导弹轨迹
We're looking at a clear missile signature.

372
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:43,400
我理解
Yes, I understand.

373
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,010
但我们是北约预警站
But we're a NATO early warning station.

374
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,400
你们的规定中要求...
Your regulations require...

375
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,630
看看这加速轨迹
Look, the acceleration here.

376
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:48,940
是一枚美国战斧式导弹
That's an American tomahawk.

377
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,110
是美国战斧式导弹
It's a tomahawk.

378
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,620
对  你们的一枚导弹出现在了
Yes, one of your missiles was in the air

379
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,490
印度和巴基斯坦附近的上空
in the vicinity of India and Pakistan,

380
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:57,430
这可能导致核大国间的核武冲突
which could lead to a nuclear power shooting back at you,

381
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,630
那可就...
and that's...

382
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,620
不太好了
you know, not good.

383
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,850
明白了
Understood.

384
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,660
-一群混蛋  -盯紧目标地区
- Bastards. - Focus on the target area.

385
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,530
回去查记录
Go back into the record,

386
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:09,930
之前一小时的每一条都不要放过
everything for the past hour.

387
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,560
挖出点能让我在北约司令部说上话的证据来
Give me something I can take to NATO command.

388
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,950
朱利安
Julian,

389
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,730
我知道这岛上的人差不多都要拍你的马屁
I know the rest of this island pretty much kisses your ass,

390
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,020
但你不能就这么大摇大摆地进来
but you can't just waltz in here.

391
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,340
天下本就没有"门"
There's no gate in this world,

392
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:24,590
只有你不想要的  没有打不开的
there's not something somebody wants won't unlock it.

393
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,380
生日快乐
Happy birthday.

394
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,070
谢谢
Thank you.

395
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,410
但你现在得走了  多少钱
But now you need to go. Uh, how much?

396
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:36,000
这是一件礼物  索菲
It's a gift, Sophie.

397
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,640
改天你回赠我一份礼物就成
Someday, you'll give me a gift.

398
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,680
舰体受损
Boat's damaged.

399
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,420
并有人员伤亡
We got casualties.

400
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,390
我们不知道是谁袭击了我们
We don't know who hit us

401
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,150
也不知道对方是否正伺机发动第二波袭击
or if they're waiting up top for a second shot.

402
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,830
全舰上下一百五十人正命悬一线
We got 150 lives at stake here,

403
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,050
你是救我们于水火的不二人选
and the man best equipped to lead us out of this mess

404
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:12,080
可你却坐在房间里听起了莫扎特
is sitting in his room chilling out to Mozart.

405
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,560
我需要你的帮助
I need your help.

406
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,140
他们也需要你
They need your help.

407
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,210
他们已经有舰长了
They have a captain.

408
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,900
就是你
You.

409
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,410
舰长接管指挥台
Captain on the conn.

410
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,340
一切正常了
We're clear, sir.

411
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,340
左右引擎推进  微速前进  操090度
All ahead, dead crawl coming to 0-9-0.

412
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,230
谢谢
Thank you.

413
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,070
还有别的事吗
Something else?

414
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,330
很多船员都在疑惑
Well, a lot of the crew's been wondering...

415
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,440
接下来该怎么办
what happens next?

416
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,270
这里是...
This is...

417
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,350
这里是代理舰长
this is the acting captain.

418
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:17,250
科罗拉多号已恢复正常运作
The "Colorado" has been returned to operational status.

419
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:19,840
本次遇袭牺牲了12名战友
We lost 12 souls in the attack.

420
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:22,460
以后我们一定会好好悼念他们
There will be time to mourn them later.

421
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:27,510
全舰的军官们
The officers of this vessel

422
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:29,400
早晚会向相关部门
will eventually appear before the proper authorities

423
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,530
解释我们此举的用意
to explain our actions.

424
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,310
在那之前  我们先找个避风港
Till then, let's get somewhere safe

425
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,660
这样大家才能再与家人团圆
so we can all see our families again.

426
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:39,230
所有人各司其职
Everybody do their job.

427
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,140
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch.

428
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,410
我查出袭击我们的是哪艘舰艇了  长官
I got a fix on the boat who shot us, sir.

429
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,760
是伊利诺斯号
It's the "Illinois."

430
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,620
自己人居然想击沉我们
Our own people tried to sink us?

431
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,740
违抗军令  你说还会是什么下场
What do you think happens when you ignore orders?

432
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,310
这不是违抗军令  只是请求解释
We didn't ignore anything. We questioned.

433
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,480
难道光凭这点就打自己人吗
You don't hit your own people for that.

434
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,500
你这是疯了  在全国海军的追击之下
This is insane. We can't hide from

435
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,830
躲得了初一躲不过十五
the entire U.S. Navy forever.

436
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,650
上尉说得对
The Lieutenant's right.

437
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,450
我们得浮出水面并举白旗投降
We need to surface and wave the white flag.

438
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,830
要是那面白旗反而让我们成了活靶子呢
And what if they use that flag as a target?

439
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,370
我们根本不知道他们奉命何为
We don't know what their orders are.

440
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,000
只知道华府高层一定出了严重问题
All we know is that there's something seriously wrong in D.C.,

441
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,200
所以我们还是抽身走人
so we're leaving this party.

442
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:09,140
这算哪门子计划
That's your damn plan?

443
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,950
当逃兵  逃到哪里  逃多久
To run? To where? For how long?

444
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,040
说够了没  水手长  去巡你的视吧
That's enough, C.O.B.! Go make your rounds!

445
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,990
老海军中流行这么一句话
Old Navy saying...

446
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,640
"愚人必自食恶果"
"The stupid will be punished."

447
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:23,780
你这是在违抗我的命令吗
Are you challenging my authority?

448
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,180
我再问一次
I'll repeat the question.

449
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,670
你还服不服从我指挥
Do you acknowledge my authority or not?

450
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,990
服从
I do.

451
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:37,110
我们被自家舰艇袭击了吗
We get shot by an American boat?

452
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:40,660
是伊利诺斯号干的  你怎么知道的
The "Illinois." How did you know?

453
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,600
转舵  操083度
Helm, come to 0-8-3.

454
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:49,220
你已经被免去舰长一职了
The captain was relieved of duty.

455
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,340
坚守你的战位  上尉
Man your station, Lieutenant.

456
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,930
你无权对我发号施令  长官
Not on orders from you, no, sir.

457
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,320
水手长  请让凯希尔上尉离开指挥台
Chief of the Boat, remove Lieutenant Cahill from the conn.

458
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,000
还等什么
Now!

459
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:09,080
这是大错特错了  你们心知肚明
You all know this is wrong.

460
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,760
舰长接管指挥台
Captain has the conn.

461
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,360
舰长接管指挥台
Captain has the conn.

462
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:22,410
格蕾丝  请标识一下航线
Grace, I need you to plot a course.

463
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:26,010
看来我们这是久旱逢甘霖啊
I think I found our oasis.

464
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,480
说得漂亮
Nice speech.

465
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:37,550
总之  山姆又得在潜艇中再待两个月了
Well, anyway, Sam's underwater for two more months.

466
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,690
如果我都没有真去做生意的勇气
Why have I been taking business classes

467
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:41,510
何必要一直上着金融课程呢
if I don't have the guts to start a real business?

468
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,550
妈  我得挂了  艾玛来了
Mom, I gotta go. Emma's coming over.

469
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,790
我们打算聊聊材料和定价的问题
We're going to talk materials and pricing.

470
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:53,950
不
No.

471
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:56,620
五角大楼有消息称
Pentagon sources say a Pakistani warship

472
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,020
一艘巴基斯坦战舰毫无预警地攻击了
fired without warning at the Ohio class

473
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,990
俄亥俄级核潜艇是美海军一个核动力潜艇等级

474
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:01,010
俄亥俄级核潜艇所属美军舰科罗拉多号
nuclear submarine U.S.S. "Colorado".

475
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,420
当时该潜艇正执行...
As it was conducting...

476
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,720
谢帕德上将
Admiral Shepard.

477
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,060
我有事跟您说
I think you'll want to talk to me.

478
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,820
是关于科罗拉多号的  长官
It's about the "Colorado," Sir.

479
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,230
我们认识吗
Do I know you?

480
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,840
我是来自辛克莱科技公司的凯莉・辛克莱
Kylie Sinclair from Sinclair Dynatronic.

481
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,060
科罗拉多号上安装有我公司的样机
We had a prototype on board the "Colorado."

482
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,330
令千金身遭不幸  我深感遗憾
I'm sorry about your daughter, sir.

483
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,830
我们因遇袭而进入二级防备状态
We've been attacked, we're at Defcon 2,

484
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,830
二级防备状态:仅次于最高级警报: 随时动用核武器

485
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,160
而你却想跟我聊你的那些小玩意儿
and you want to talk about your toy?

486
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,420
你我心知肚明  潜艇根本不是巴基斯坦人击沉的
We both know the Pakistanis didn't sink her.

487
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,640
那只是你们编出来的官方说法
No matter what you're telling the American people.

488
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,050
-你说什么  -我花了一年时间
- What? - It took me a year

489
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:34,860
才在科罗拉多号上安装上我公司的系统
to get my system on the "Colorado",

490
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,510
我绝不会再等一年
and I am not gonna wait another year.

491
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,510
所以你若想让我守口如瓶
So if you want me to keep quiet,

492
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,990
下一艘出航的船上必须装上我的设备
you put my equipment on the next boat that goes out.

493
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,870
给我滚
You get the hell out of my face.

494
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:45,460
有个海军情报部的朋友给我发了这条短信
A friend in Navy intelligence sent me this text...

495
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,900
472 查普林
"472 Chaplin"...

496
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:49,380
-就在科罗拉多号遇袭前五分钟 -你哪个朋友
- five minutes before the "Colorado" Was hit. - What friend?

497
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,950
海军总部当时准备执行
Naval command was processing

498
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,810
海军军规第472条  撤掉查普林的舰长一职
a 472 protocol removal of Captain Chaplin.

499
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:56,470
你所面对的是一名叛变的核潜艇舰长
You had a rogue captain of a nuclear submarine.

500
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,580
舰上满载着十八枚三叉戟核弹
And with 18 tridents on board,

501
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,820
没人敢以身犯险
no one was gonna take any chances.

502
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:04,740
是你亲手击沉了自己的核潜艇  长官
So you sank your own boat... sir.

503
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:06,610
你个畜生
You son of a bitch.

504
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:09,680
你女儿还在船上
You sank your own daughter's boat.

505
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:15,500
你居然不知情
You didn't know?

506
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:16,660
长官
Sir?

507
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,650
我们得走了
We need to go now.

508
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:40,460
我知道我自私  但我不想你走
I know it's selfish, but don't go.

509
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,150
就擅离职守一次嘛
Go awol.

510
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,950
我们一起私奔
We'll go on the run together...

511
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:46,910
周游世界  销声匿迹  自给自足
town to town, hiding out, living off the land.

512
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:50,320
-就像雌雄大盗那样吗  -雌雄大盗...
- What, like Bonnie and Clyde? - Bonnie and Clyde...

513
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,320
《雌雄大盗》是好莱坞著名电影  男女主人公最后双双被击毙

514
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,400
下场是双双被子弹打成马蜂窝
Minus all the bullets at the end.

515
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,230
没错
Right.

516
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:02,210
四个月后我就回来了
I'll be back in four months.

517
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,010
我好爱你
Oh, I love you.

518
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,510
"全舰军官早晚自会向相关部门
"We'll appear before the proper

519
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:27,300
解释我们此举的用意"  是这意思吗
authorities to explain our actions"?

520
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:28,870
下一步呢
Then what?

521
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,680
这要看到底是谁下的令
Depends who really sent the order.

522
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:32,890
我去过船员餐厅
Well, I've been down in the crew's mess,

523
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:33,820
他们都看着我
and they're all looking at me,

524
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:35,060
而我却无言以对
and I don't know what to say to them.

525
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,990
那就什么都别说
You don't say anything.

526
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,200
你要让他们懂得如何坚强
You show them how to be strong.

527
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:50,870
如果你当时让我转动那把钥匙  我本会照做的
If you had told me to, I would've turned that key.

528
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:55,010
谢谢你没那样做
Thank you for not making me.

529
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,720
比做爱都爽
Better than sex.

530
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,960
说明你不够性福
Well, you're having the wrong kind of sex.

531
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,330
下面播报一则爆炸性新闻  巴基斯坦袭击
In breaking news, Pakistan has attacked and sunk

532
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:13,090
并击沉了一艘美国核潜艇...
an American nuclear submarine...

533
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,260
你看这条新闻了吗
Do you see this?

534
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,430
都是骗人的  是美国人在搬弄是非
They're lying. That was the American tomahawk.

535
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:21,470
接通司令部
Call command.

536
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,740
呼叫司令部  这里是北约驻圣玛丽娜监测站
Command, this is NATO listening post, Sainte Marina.

537
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,670
发现两条始于印度洋的核弹轨道
We're reporting two tracks originating in the Indian Ocean.

538
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,240
目标巴基斯坦
Are we shooting at Pakistan?

539
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,480
动真格的了
It's real.

540
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,140
天哪
Oh, God.

541
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,090
你就不能阻止它们吗
Can't you do anything?

542
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,790
来不及了
No. It's too late.

543
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:44,990
天哪
Oh...

544
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:49,300
长官  低频段收到大量波动
Sir, major shock waves on low frequency.

545
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,370
巴基斯坦附近有核弹爆炸
Those are nukes going off near Pakistan.

546
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,830
好了
Okay.

547
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,670
战争打响了
The fight's started.

548
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,540
现在加入战局还不算晚
It's not too late to get into it.

549
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,450
长官  突击队已经就绪
Sir, assault teams are ready.

550
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,780
浮出水面拥抱阳光吧
Let's grab some sunlight, people.

551
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,480
散开  你们去那边
Come on. Get 'em out of the streets!

552
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:42,720
退后
Get back!

553
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,980
所有人都退后
Get back! Get back!

554
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,980
你会说英语吗
You speak English?

555
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,120
医院在哪
Where's the hospital?

556
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,730
医院  就在那边
The hospital? It's over there.

557
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,910
詹姆斯  照顾好吉尔  霍普有我们呢
James, take care of Gil. We got Hopper.

558
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:13,150
我得找个地方把我朋友放下
I need a place to keep my friend

559
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,280
直到能带他回家
until I can get him home.

560
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:28,960
一千美元租你的储藏柜够吗
$1,000 U.S. Cover it?

561
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,730
剩下的是酒钱
Rest is to start a tab.

562
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,170
把你最好的酒都拿来
Best scotch you have.

563
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,040
趴下  快趴下
Get down! Get down! Get down!

564
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:42,750
趴下
Get down!

565
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,450
安全
Clear!

566
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:49,610
你们是谁
Who are you?

567
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:50,950
凯姆伦  有什么发现
Talk to me, Cameron.

568
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,080
跟科罗拉多号一样的系统
Same interface as the "Colorado",

569
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,250
一样的软件
same software.

570
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,790
很好  雷达通讯全开
Good. Get us eyes and ears.

571
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,880
-一切安全就绪  -你们以为这是哪里啊
- We're clear. - I don't know where you think you are,

572
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,930
这个监测站归北约所有
but this station belongs to NATO.

573
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:00,130
你错了
No.

574
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:03,550
这个监测站和外面停靠的那艘潜艇
This station and that sub parked outside,

575
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,130
现在起都归我管
they all belong to me now.

576
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,910
谢帕德上将办公室
Admiral Shepard's office.

577
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,180
亚瑟  我是马库斯
Arthur, it's Marcus.

578
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,550
格蕾丝就在我旁边
Grace is right here.

579
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,250
爸  是我
Dad, it's me.

580
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,390
我以为你死了
I thought I'd lost you.

581
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,590
爸
Dad...

582
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:34,060
你一直告诉我荣誉高于一切
You always told me, honor before all.

583
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,700
等你了解事情始末后
So... when you learn what happened...

584
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:42,240
希望你能为我们自豪
I hope you're proud of us.

585
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:48,180
亚瑟  我们从南极司令部收到开火指令
Arthur, we got fire orders on the Antarctic Network.

586
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,310
当我们请求确认时  伊利诺伊号向我们开火
When we asked for confirmation, the "Illinois" Shot us up,

587
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,020
差点被击沉
damn near killed us.

588
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,820
白宫说是巴基斯坦人干的
The White House said it was the Pakistanis.

589
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,390
现在是战时
We're at war.

590
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:00,420
亚瑟  你还在吗
Arthur, are you there?

591
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:19,110
我没法不注意到今天一下子
I couldn't help but notice an increase in...

592
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,380
多了不少游客
tourists today.

593
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:22,780
你到我这个可爱小岛
Afraid I need to ask you your intentions

594
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:23,900
来干什么
towards my beautiful little island.

595
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:28,690
我就是想来喝个大醉
My only intention is to get fall-down drunk.

596
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,590
不过你可能发现他们已经接管这里了
Although you may have noticed the guy invading the place.

597
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,560
他们准备什么时候滚蛋
And when does this man plan on leaving?

598
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,730
我觉得
Wild guess--

599
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:38,230
直到一个小时前
up until about an hour ago,

600
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,560
这里还是你说了算
you ran things here--

601
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:42,430
毒品  枪支  美女
drugs, guns, girls.

602
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,010
不管你有什么  都跟外面港口
Whatever it is, it's no match

603
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:47,270
停的那个大家伙比不了
for the boomer floating in your harbor.

604
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,040
这没你事了  "朋友"
You're done, friend.

605
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:57,010
我理解咱俩之间有些
I understand there might be some, uh,

606
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,720
文化差异
cultural differences here,

607
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:02,220
我帮你翻译下
so I'll translate.

608
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:04,590
我们那边  一般管你叫朋友的
When someone where I'm from calls you "Friend,"

609
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,060
都不把你当朋友看
they don't consider you one.

610
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:11,180
这是我的岛
This is my island.

611
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,190
想让我同意你们留下
If I allow your presence,

612
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:16,530
可是有条件的
it comes with certain terms and conditions.

613
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,570
明白吗
Is that clear...

614
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,170
"朋友"
friend?

615
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:24,180
第一个就是他
He's first.

616
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:26,340
你这堆人里就他真会开枪
He's the only real shooter in your bunch,

617
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,950
所以他先死
so the first bullet's his.

618
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:29,880
两枪打穿胸口
Big fella's probably gonna need two in the chest

619
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,520
确保他这个大胖子
to make sure his fat ass goes down,

620
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,250
死翘翘
so two he gets.

621
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,960
他还没摸到枪
And while dopey over there

622
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,360
这边这个两眼之间
fumbles for his gun in his back waistband,

623
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,690
就中一枪了  他也跑不了
grumpy gets one between the eyes, and so does he.

624
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,000
至于你
You, though...

625
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,160
"白雪公主"
Snow White...

626
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:45,400
我要一枪打穿你脖子
You I'm gonna shoot clean through the neck.

627
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:48,690
血大片涌出来
And that way, as the blood is gushing out your choking throat

628
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,730
你呛着想求我饶你一命
and you desperately beg me for your life,

629
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:54,360
可惜你一个字也说不出来
you won't be able to make a sound.

630
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,180
不想这样
Or...

631
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:00,210
就离我远点  让我好好喝酒
You could leave me in peace to enjoy my drink.

632
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,610
你们美国人
Americans...

633
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,920
有种  够自信
Such confidence.

634
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:33,230

Listen to me. I don't know what you've heard, but I can explain it all.

640
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:48,670
我得先安全回家
I just need to get home first.

641
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:50,790
宝贝  当初我就不该离你而去
You were right, baby. I never should've left you.

642
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:53,240
没关系  都没关系  别想这些
No, no, no, no. None of that matters.

643
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,740
求求你  回家就好
Just come home to me, baby. Please.

644
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,920
我会回去的  一定会回去的
I will. I'm gonna get back.

645
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,960
我保证好好补偿你
I'm gonna make it up to you. I promise.

646
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:03,060
请你相信我
Just...please believe in me.

647
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:07,560
记着我有多爱你
Please remember how much I love you.

648
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,340
我也爱你
I love you, too.

649
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,170
不管他们说什么  都别...
Whatever they say about me, you d--

650
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:15,080
-山姆  山姆  -经常这样吗
- Sam? Sam! - Is this normal?

651
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,640
-不是  -发电机在哪
- No. - Where's the power?

652
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,410
所有系统都已瘫痪
All their systems are offline.

653
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,640
有我  水兵斯特恩和水手长
It's myself, Seaman Stern, and the C.O.B.

654
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,330
是的  长官  他们完全失去与外界联系
Yes, sir. They are blind.

655
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,440
不知道能坚持多久
I don't know for how much longer.

656
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:33,490
不用  长官  这是我们职责所在
No, no need, sir. It's our duty.

657
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:36,110
-退后  劳伦斯  -山姆把枪放下
- Step back, Lawrence. - Put the gun down, Sam.

658
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,860
不然我把你们俩都打死
I swear, I'll shoot you both.

659
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,570
你切断了电源
You cut the power,

660
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:52,780
还告诉司令部我们失去了与外界的联系
you called command, and you told them we'd be blind.

661
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,070
咱们无论如何都是死路一条
We're all dead anyway.

662
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:55,700
只不过你还不知道
You just don't know it yet.

663
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,660
跪下
Now get on your knees.

664
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:00,160
快跪下
On your knees!

665
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,870
我是不会让你得逞的
I'm not gonna let you do this.

666
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,830
山姆  抱歉  谁让你那么听老舰长的话
Sorry, Sam. You've always put too much faith in the old man.

667
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:17,190
你们到底干了些什么
What the hell did you just do?

668
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,480
来电了  系统正在重启
The power's back. Rebooting.

669
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:25,970
凯姆伦 什么情况
What have we got, Cameron?

670
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:28,220
两架飞机正向我方飞来
Two birds heading our way.

671
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,100
是B-1轰炸机  十五分钟后到达
B-1 bombers. 15 minutes out.

672
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,300
召集所有人回潜艇  要快
Get everyone back to the sub. Now.

673
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,910
轰炸机正在逼近  七分钟后到达
Bombers seven minutes out. Closing.

674
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:37,540
所有人员均已到齐
All crew accounted for except two.

675
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,090
除了布兰伦和科泰兹
We're short Brannan and Cortez.

676
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,470
去找他们  准备下潜
Find them. Prepare to dive.

677
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,880
慢着  我们绝不丢下一个人
Delay that. We're not leaving crew behind.

678
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,620
轰炸机会让整个小镇生灵涂炭
And hiding in the ocean is not gonna stop them

679
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,770
可我们深藏在海中  是阻止不了他们的
from bombing this town and all the people in it.

680
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:49,720
这样不行  我们得化守为攻了
No. We need to change the game.

681
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:54,960
准备发射  将一号导弹就位
Weapons, conn. Spin up missile one.

682
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:57,670
发射准备  一号导弹已装载完毕
Conn, weapons. Missile one is loaded and ready.

683
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,230
坐标已锁定  长官
Coordinates set, sir.

684
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:06,570
听我的口令  三  二  一
On my mark. Three, two, one.

685
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,730
这回可要出大事了
That's not good.

686
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,270
轰炸机四分钟后到达
Bombers four minutes out.

687
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:27,840
我是科罗拉多号核潜艇舰长马库斯・查普林
This is captain Marcus Chaplin of the U.S.S. "Colorado".

688
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:30,240
你向我方派来了两架轰炸机
You have two bombers bearing down on our position.

689
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,400
作为回击  我们向华府发射了一枚导弹
In response, we have a bird in flight toward D.C.

690
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,680
你应该已经监测到了吧
I'm sure you're reading it.

691
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,460
我是科利  别虚张声势了  马库斯
This is Curry. You're bluffing, Marcus.

692
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,180
立即启动导弹自毁装置
Initiate missile destruct immediately

693
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,970
这是美国总统的命令
by order of the President of the United States.

694
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,690
拒绝执行
Negative.

695
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:47,580
若轰炸机未在两分钟内掉头
If those bombers aren't turned around within two minutes,

696
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:51,010
我敢打包票  那枚导弹定会在华府引爆
you have my word, that missile will detonate.

697
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:53,100
科罗拉多号报告完毕
"Colorado" out.

698
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:05,240
轰炸机一分钟后到达  它们没有掉头
Bombers one minute out. Still coming. They're not turning around.

699
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:14,700
全体注意  我是舰长
Attention all hands, this is your captain.

700
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,140
一切努力徒劳无功  遭袭在所难免
Despite our best efforts, an attack is imminent.

701
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,590
我们不可能生还
We won't survive it.

702
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:25,130
能与诸位并肩作战  我荣幸之至
It's been my honor to have served with each and every one of you.

703
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:30,070
能与诸位一同赴死  我别无他求
There's no one else I'd rather be with right now.

704
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:34,420
导弹经过印第安纳州上空了  长官
Missile passing over Indiana, sir.

705
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,300
准备启动导弹自毁装置
Prepare to destruct missile.

706
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:41,130
轰炸机三十秒后到达
Bombers' 30 seconds out.

707
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,840
看来你不能马上去司令部赴任了
Guess that desk job will have to wait.

708
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,200
反正我也不太适合坐在办公室里  长官
I wasn't built for desks anyway, sir.

709
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:53,250
听我下令  启动导弹自毁装置  三  二
On my mark, initiate missile destruct sequence. Three, two--

710
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:55,730
等等  轰炸机掉头回去了
Wait! The bombers are turning back!

711
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,440
科罗拉多号  我是科利
"Colorado," this is Curry.

712
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,790
轰炸机已撤离  快启动导弹自毁装置
Bombers have disengaged. Initiate missile destruct now.

713
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:16,280
晚了  截止时间是九十秒前
Too late. You missed the deadline by 90 seconds.

714
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,940
舰长  请您插入钥匙
Captain, put your key in,

715
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,920
启动导弹自毁装置  快
and initiate missile destruct sequence, now.

716
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,090
若他们不认为我们对其构成威胁
If they don't think we'll back up our threats,

717
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:24,690
不出一周  我们必死无疑
we'll be dead in a week,

718
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:26,770
这座小镇上的所有居民也难以幸免
along with everyone else in this town.

719
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:28,960
必须让他们明白  我言出必行
They need to understand, I'm a man of my word.

720
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,980
马库斯  求你了
Marcus...please.

721
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,940
我作出的任何决定  何时损害过
Have I ever done anything other than what was in the best interest

722
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,400
这艘潜艇  全体艇员以及国家的利益
of this boat, this crew, and our nation?

723
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:00,130
爆炸很成功  落点在华盛顿以东两百英里
We have a good detonation, 200 miles east of Washington.

724
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,320
在那里引爆  不会造成人员伤亡
That distance, no one will be hurt.

725
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,060
但却能起到足够的威慑作用
But I'd say we got their attention.

726
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:17,470
我是科罗拉多号核潜艇舰长马库斯・查普林
I'm captain Marcus Chaplin of the U.S.S. "Colorado".

727
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,620
不久前  我艇接到命令
A short time ago, my submarine was ordered

728
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:23,950
向巴基斯坦发射四枚洲际弹道核导弹
to fire four nuclear I.C.B.M.s at Pakistan.

729
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:26,060
但这些命令来自一个备用
These orders came through a secondary,

730
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,680
且可靠性较差的通讯频道
less secure network.

731
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,120
兹事体大  牵涉到几百万人的生命
With millions of lives at stake,

732
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,520
我向政府高层请求  核准此条命令
I requested confirmation of the order

733
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,690
并通过正规渠道下达
be sent through the normal and proper channel.

734
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,110
然而  紧接着
In response,

735
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:41,110
美国伊利诺伊号攻击型潜艇便袭击了我们
an American attack sub, the U.S.S. "Illinois" fired on us

736
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,950
并对我艇上的船员安危置之不理
and left my crew for dead

737
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,450
听任我们在印度洋底自生自灭
at the bottom of the Indian Ocean.

738
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:47,840
格蕾丝  你等着瞧
You little bitch, Grace.

739
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:51,250
你该说  "上尉  你等着瞧"
It's "You little bitch, lieutenant".

740
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,640
我艇所经历的事  不禁令我们意识到
From our submarine, we have watched as the fabric of trust

741
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,750
政府与人民之间的纽带正慢慢断裂
between government and its people has been torn.

742
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,880
当我们大胆地向政府提出质疑
And when this boat dared to question

743
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,030
为何要夷平一个
why a nation without the capability

744
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:05,110
对美国本土并无威胁的国家
to directly harm the homeland was to be destroyed,

745
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:07,290
政府中的决策者竟下令杀害
elements of that government tried to kill

746
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:09,740
我艇上这一百五十名志愿服役的水手
the 150 volunteer sailors on my boat.

747
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,900
长官  那条情报是错的
Sir, the intell is wrong!

748
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:16,690
我们...我们杀错人了
We...we killed the wrong people.

749
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,240
并且他们还继续一意孤行
And then these same elements continued on their course...

750
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,480
-毫无缘由地...  -门没锁
- A first strike... - It's open.

751
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,900
向我艇发动了进攻
Unprovoked.

752
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,900
全体船员皆可作证
We have all borne witness.

753
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,690
我们接管了圣玛丽娜岛上的
We have commandeered the NATO early warning station

754
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:36,510
北约预警监测站
on the island of Sainte Marina.

755
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:38,070
运用站内设备
From this facility,

756
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:40,820
可监测世界各国军队的动向
we can see the movements of all the world's militaries.

757
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:43,040
一切尽在我们的掌控之中
We are in control.

758
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,950
我宣布  这座岛周围
I am declaring a 200-mile

759
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:47,750
两军交战的无人地带  是双方要争夺的地方

760
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:47,750
方圆两百英里的地区为无人地带
no-man's-land around this island,

761
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:49,750
即刻生效
effective immediately.

762
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:54,000
至于我  以及科罗拉多号上全体船员
As for myself and the men and women of the U.S.S. "Colorado"...

763
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,550
-看见新闻了吗  -我们深爱着祖国
- You see that? - We love our country.

764
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:01,530
都怪我  要不是我  这一切就不会发生
That was my fault. I made that happen.

765
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:04,510
为国捐躯  我们在所不辞
We would gladly die for what it represents.

766
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:07,790
都怪我  都怪我  都怪我
It was me. It was me. It was me.

767
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,570
我闯下大祸了
What did I do?

768
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:13,300
但我们绝不承认  也不听命于一个
But we do not recognize or obey

769
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,570
曾试图屠戮自己的子民的政府
a government that tries to murder its own.

770
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,590
若美国当局或世界上任何一个国家
If the current United States executive

771
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:20,100
派兵非法侵入了我们的领地
or any other nation violates this perimeter,

772
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:22,820
我们定会用艇上所余十七枚核弹
we have 17 more nuclear missiles aboard,

773
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:26,830
对来者予以坚决反击  绝不手软
and we will not hesitate to unleash fiery hell down upon you.

774
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:28,370
我言出必行
I give you my word.

775
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,250
若敢挑衅
Test us,

776
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:37,310
我们便同归于尽
and we will all burn...together.

777
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:41,990
勿谓言之不预
You've been warned.

778
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,200
关上吧
Cut it.

779
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:58,760
真是太疯狂了  长官
Just crazy enough, sir.

780
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:24,660
这是维修潜艇的人员找到的
Repair crews found it.

781
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:27,480
看来她还真是不想离开你啊
She's not easy to lose, is she?

782
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:30,120
多谢
Thank you.

783
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,060
这个曾养育我的祖国到底出了什么乱子
What happened to the country I grew up in?

784
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,110
被那些政客搞得一团糟
They've made it all a mess.

785
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,430
我们有能力做得更好
We could do better.

786
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:45,030
就在这里
Right here.

787
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:47,120
从零开始
Start from scratch.

788
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,150
我们的所做的一切努力  只有一个目的
Everything we did was to stay alive long enough

789
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,590
就是恢复清白之身并活着回家
to get our names cleared and to get home.

790
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:01,380
也许现在这里就是我们的家了
Maybe this is home now.

长官  刚通过南极紧急通讯网
Sir, I have a missile fire order

22
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:04,240
收到导弹发射命令
from the Antarctic Network.

23
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,470
为什么是南极通讯网
Why the Antarctic Network?

24
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,830
你去把有权力下达这个命令的人叫来
I'm not going to annihilate 4.3 million Pakistanis

25
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,650
否则我绝不会屠杀430万巴基斯坦国民
without hearing from someone whose authority I recognize.

26
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,280
我查出袭击我们的是哪艘潜艇了  长官
I got a fix on the boat who shot us, sir.

27
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,230
是伊利诺伊号
It's the Illinois.

28
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:15,740

Our own people tried to sink us?

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,630
我们接管了圣玛丽娜岛上的
We have commandeered the NATO early warning station

34
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,050
北约预警雷达站
on the island of Sainte Marina.

35
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,440
我宣布  这座岛周围
I am declaring a 200-mile

36
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,390
方圆两百英里的地区为无人地带
no-man's-land around this island.

37
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:33,720
山姆  是你
Sam? Sam, is that you?

38
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,700
真的是我  我没事
It's me. I'm okay.

39
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,010
不管你听说了什么
Listen to me, I don't know what you've heard,

40
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:37,370
我都可以解释
but I can explain it all.

41
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,660
请你相信我
Just please believe in me.

42
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:39,810
快跪下
On your knees!

43
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,460
我是不会让你得逞的
I'm not gonna let you do this.

44
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,740
你们到底干了些什么
What the hell did you just do?

45
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,290
若美国当局派兵非法侵入了我们的领地
If the current United States executive violates this perimeter,

46
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,390
我们便同归于尽
we will all burn together.

47
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,820
勿谓言之不预
You've been warned.

48
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,730
爸爸  短时间内我没法再给你发录像了
Hey, dad. So this will be the last of these for a while.

49
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,980
我们明天要开拔
We're headed out tomorrow.

50
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,080
我特别激动
I'm excited.

51
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,310
都准备好了
We're ready.

52
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:14,200
艇长接管指挥台
Captain's on the conn.

53
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:14,950
情况报告
Status?

54
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,360
航向070度  深度200英尺  长官
Heading 0-7-0 to a depth of 200 feet, sir.

55
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,480
很好  声纳报告
Very well. Sonar?

56
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,730
普林斯顿号和蒙特雷号已经到达无人区边界
The Princeton and the Monterey have reached the perimeter.

57
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,060
还有16艘舰艇正在逼近
I'm tracking 16 other signatures, all closing on us.

58
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,940
兄弟们  咱们现在简直是万人迷
Well, people, we are now the popular girl at the dance.

59
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,370
谢帕德中尉  你那里有什么情况
Lieutenant Shepard, what do you see?

60
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,110
雷达上显示  另有20余艘战舰
We're reading some 20 other warships

61
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,390
正在逼近200英里无人区边界
closing in on the 200-mile line,

62
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,790
大部分将于48小时内到达
most should arrive within the next 48 hours.

63
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,350
准备开始测试样机
We're preparing to test the prototype.

64
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,490
注意监测
Keep those eyes on us.

65
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,810
索菲  我们应该帮他们吗
Sophie, should we be helping these people?

66
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,750
这你得自己决定
You have to decide that for yourself.

67
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,250
我可不趟这浑水
I won't be a part of it.

68
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,810
工程舱  我是指挥台
Engineering, conn.

69
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,030
准备启动珀尔修斯样机
Stand ready to engage the Perseus prototype.

70
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,100
是  长官
Aye-aye, Sir.

71
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,180
样机和潜艇所有重要系统紧密相连
The prototype is tied in to every major system on the sub.

72
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,700
它一旦失灵  潜艇就瘫痪了
It goes down, we're done.

73
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,050
恕我直言  长官
And with respect, sir,

74
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,410
我们应该在事情彻底失控前
we should be on the phone with D.C.

75
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,180
跟华府取得联系
sorting through this mess

76
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,870
协调解决方案
before it can't be sorted out.

77
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,730
全体注意  我是艇长
Attention, all hands. This is your captain.

78
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,980
目前有20余艘战舰正向我方逼近
There are some 20-plus warships descending on us.

79
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,670
昔日的战友现在却要来取我们的性命
These are our brothers in arms, sent now to kill us.

80
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,000
我们会找机会寻求谈判和解
There will be a time to talk,

81
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,960
但要先让他们知道我们的实力
but right now we show strength.

82
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,950
艇长讲话完毕
Captain out.

83
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,300
工程舱  我是指挥台  启动珀尔修斯系统
Engineering, conn. Engage the Perseus.

84
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,040
是  长官
Aye-aye, sir.

85
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,300
发动机系统依然正常
SSDG still online sir.

86
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,310
长官  潜艇从雷达上消失了
You just vanished off our screen, sir.

87
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,980
看来样机达到了预期效果
Looks like the prototype works.

88
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,140
他们还在追踪我们
They're hunting for us.

89
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,700
长官  边界附近有战舰在巡逻侦察
Sir, something patrolling low right outside the perimeter.

90
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,950
已确认对方身份
I.D. off those screws,

91
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:46,870
是伊利诺伊号
it's the Illinois.

92
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,410
它一直在边界线上来回穿梭
She's dipping back and forth across the line.

93
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,490
这是在试探
She's testing the fence.

94
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,020
若我们不给他们个教训
We don't make that line real to them,

95
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,040
它早晚会开进来灭了我们
sooner or later, she'll cross over to kill us.

96
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,520
全员进入战斗状态
Man battle stations.

97
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,860
伊利诺伊号上可有134名官兵呢
134 on board the Illinois, Sir.

98
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,100
舵手  调整航向  拦截伊利诺伊号
Helm, put us on intercept with the Illinois.

99
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,420
艇长  他们从声纳上消失了
Captain, they've just disappeared.

100
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,710
看来马库斯搞了个新玩意儿
Looks like Marcus has a new toy.

101
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,010
仔细监听
Listen carefully.

102
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,860
我艇正后方有鱼雷袭击
Launch transients dead astern!

103
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,750
规避机动  右满舵
Evasive maneuver, right full rudder.

104
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,280
启动紧急应对措施
Launch countermeasures now!

105
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,030
来不及了  鱼雷即将命中
Too late. Torpedo is homing.

106
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,450
撞击倒计时  五  四...
Impact in five, four...

107
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,220
三  二...
three, two...

108
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,410
无战斗部的鱼雷命中目标  长官
Disabled warhead's a hit, sir.

109
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:48,530
伊利诺斯号已调头
Illinois turning away.

110
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,550
它转动艇身
She's rolling over,

111
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,200
露出肚皮  向我们示弱了
showing us her belly.

112
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,080
但它还会伺机反咬一口
But she'll still bite if she gets the chance.

113
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,160
火控室  我是指挥台
Weapons, conn.

114
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,120
下一枚鱼雷准备  继续锁定目标
The next torpedo's armed. Keep your lock.

115
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,190
领航员  带我们返航
Nav...take us back.

116
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,270
是  长官
Yes, sir.

117
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,330
看见了吗
Do you see?

118
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,590
他们的行径可能会造成巨大灾难
The devastation could have been so much--

119
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,350
什么叫"可能"
"Could have"?

120
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,290
核弹落点距离海岸线有200英里远
That's gotta be maybe 200 miles off the coast.

121
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:15,470
比拉斯韦加斯到内华达州核试验基地还远
That's further than Vegas was to the Nevada test range.

122
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,270
在那个基地  可进行了数百次核试验
And they set off a couple hundred nukes there.

123
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,470
你的丈夫与所有追随马库斯・查普林的
Your husband and all the men and women

124
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,310
男女士兵都将死无葬身之地
following Marcus Chaplin will die

125
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,150
除非我们让这场闹剧赶紧结束
if we can't end this now.

126
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,510
现在山姆孤身在外
Now Sam is out there alone.

127
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,400
他很困惑
He's confused.

128
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,330
他可能一心只想
He probably wants, more than anything,

129
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,900
履行一名士兵应尽的义务
just to do the right thing.

130
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,140
那就帮帮他
Then help him.

131
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,650
上尉  报告军情
Sitrep, lieutenant.

132
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,010
监测站与巡逻哨的岗位都已安排好
We've manned stations and patrols,

133
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,340
但约有四分之一的艇员尚未到岗
but about a quarter of the crew aren't reporting for shifts.

134
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,970
科泰兹和布兰伦仍未归队
Cortez and Brannan are still missing

135
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:43,670
目前判定为擅离职守
and assumed awol.

136
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,840
科泰兹是第三次出海了  她不会擅离职守
Cortez is third tour. She's not awol.

137
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,250
我们得开始搜寻他们了
We gotta start looking for 'em.

138
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,810
长官  还有  水手长...
And, sir, the C.O.B.--

139
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,680
他被关押在小镇的监狱
he's under guard in what the town uses as a jail,

140
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,080
但始终不肯安分一点
and he is not making things any easier.

141
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,660
水手  开门
Sailor, open the gate.

142
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,650
瑞德  告诉她  这可不是在潜艇上
Tell her we ain't home, Red.

143
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,160
水手  你没听到我下达的直接命令吗
Sailor, I just gave you a direct order.

144
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,960
抱歉  长官  我手里没钥匙
Sorry, ma'am. I don't have the key.

145
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:14,310
要知道  格蕾丝
You know, Grace,

146
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,890
等你背上叛变与谋杀的罪名
when they find you guilty of mutiny, of murder,

147
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,710
到时牢狱之灾都不足为惧
it's not gonna be the jail cell that gets to you.

148
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,120
而在民众的欢呼声中
It's gonna be the sound of the people outside

149
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,530
被送上刑场
chanting for your death.

150
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,420
那才会把你逼疯
That's what's gonna drive you insane...

151
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,300
把锁砸烂
Break it down.

152
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,580
而且你那位海军上将老爹
And knowing that your admiral daddy

153
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,280
甚至都无法到你的坟前悼念你
is not gonna be able to visit your grave.

154
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,790
我说了  给我把锁砸烂
I said, break it down. Now.

155
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,640
上尉
Lieutenant.

156
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:34,800
开门
Open it up.

157
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,050
她根本就不配当军人
She should've never been wearing those stripes to begin with.

158
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:44,960
你却让她担任要职
But you put her there,

159
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,700
如今  她杀死了我一个水手
and she killed one of my men.

160
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,150
你还有什么需要吗  水手长
You have everything you need, C.O.B.?

161
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,820
我至今仍不敢相信
I never would've believed

162
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,560
我的朋友兼我的艇长
that my friend and commanding officer

163
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,540
在需要他担负起职责时  竟会心慈手软
would go soft when it came time to do his duty.

164
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:56,730
我很清楚我的职责
Oh, I know my duty.

165
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:57,680
是吗
Do you?

166
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,860
您的职责  就是接到发射命令就发射导弹
Your duty, sir, is to fire when you're told to fire.

167
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,810
您的职责  就是在祖国需要的时候
Your duty, sir, is to be the strong

168
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,760
毫不迟疑地强力出击
and unwavering fist of our nation.

169
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,060
为什么他们通过南极紧急通讯网下达命令
Why'd they send the orders through the Antarctic channel?

170
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,560
为什么他们朝我们开火
Why would they fire on us?

171
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,620
我只是个水手
I'm a sailor.

172
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,630
我没资格质疑这些
I don't have the luxury to ask.

173
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,640
是的  你没有
No, you don't,

174
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,850
所以你只是个水手长  而我才是艇长
which is why you're the C.O.B., and I'm the captain.

175
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,520
你是我的朋友  马库斯
You're my friend,  Marcus.

176
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,710
但我再不会承认你是我的艇长
But you're no longer the captain of my boat.

177
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,780
你还好意思穿着这身军装
That uniform you're still wearing?

178
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,740
你根本不配
That's borrowed glory.

179
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,390
我向来欣赏你的直言不讳  水手长
I've always appreciated your candor, C.O.B.

180
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,740
锁上门  水手
Lock it up, sailor.

181
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,020
你还好吗  上尉
You all right, lieutenant?

182
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,380
不是很好
Not really.

183
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,050
副艇长  请求您免除我的职务
X.O., you're gonna have to relieve me.

184
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,620
抱歉  我没有为官兵们树立一个好榜样
I'm sorry, but I'm not setting an example for the enlisted.

185
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,770
这不是他们的问题  是我的错
And it's not their fault, it's me.

186
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,530
我不知道自己究竟在这里做什么
I don't know who I am here.

187
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,740
那就去想明白
Well, then figure it out.

188
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,020
如果这里局面失控  我们就都会命丧黄泉
Look, we lose control here, we're all dead.

189
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,020
明白吗
You get that?

190
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,880
虽然我对此无能为力  但是我需要你
I can't fix this for you, but I do need you.

191
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,100
如果他们不相信你
They don't believe in you?

192
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,910
你就想办法让他们相信  从今天起
You make them, today.

193
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,120
这少于200英里了
That's closer than 200 miles.

194
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,720
飞机在15秒前穿过了无人区
Aircraft crossed the perimeter 15 seconds ago.

195
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,040
这家伙大得很  正在查明该机身份
Whatever it is, it's big. Working the ident.

196
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,500
打开导弹舱门  确保他们看到
Open hatches. Make sure the world can see it.

197
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:28,900
艾森豪威尔号上的F-18战斗机紧急起飞
"Eisenhower" is scrambling F-18s

198
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,230
前来拦截了  长官
to intercept, sir.

199
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,950
他们询问是否能跨越界线  以便转向
They're asking if they can cross our line to turn around.

200
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,090
查明该机身份  快
I.D. the bird, now.

201
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,060
等等
Wait.

202
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,580
台湾航空29-76号的飞行员  请转向
Pilot of Taiwan Air 29-76, turn around.

203
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,110
能听见吗
Do you hear me?

204
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,040
是一架波音747客机
It's a Passenger 747.

205
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,870
你觉得它离我们有多近
How close do you think it got?

206
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,340
说不准  也许有40英里
I don't know. Maybe 40 miles.

207
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,930
也许会有一队三角洲特种兵从飞机上伞降
A Delta force team could H.A.L.O. down from that plane,

208
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,840
降落在远处海面上  再划艇上岸
hit the water on the far side, paddle in.

209
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,100
六个小时后他们就能到这里
They could be here six hours after that.

210
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,300
他们不会浪费时间
They didn't waste any time.

211
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,020
我去阻击他们
I'll go.

212
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,270
我带一队人  想办法拦截他们
I'll take a team, try and cut 'em off.

213
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,090
山姆  如果真是三角洲部队...
Sam, if those are Deltas-

214
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,120
我知道
I know.

215
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,830
但如果他们轻敌
If they don't think we made 'em,

216
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,230
也许我们尚有胜算
maybe we get the upper hand.

217
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,570
你留在这儿  尽你所能
You stay here. You do what you can.

218
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,210
我去阻击他们
I'll go.

219
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:09,760
先展示实力
Show strength.

220
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,760
然后谈判
Then talk.

221
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,590
如果你的估计没错
If you're right,

222
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,530
你作战时还需要一名可信任的副官
you'll need a second out there you can trust.

223
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,750
我报名参加此次任务  长官
Volunteering for the mission, sir.

224
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,900
解酒药
Hangover cure.

225
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,000
都喝掉  吧台上还有一杯
Drink it. There's another at the bar.

226
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,550
我以为受过特种训练的人不会这么容易醉
I thought you special forces hot shots could handle your liquor.

227
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,860
你有船吗
Do you have a boat,

228
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,820
或其他能离开这岛的交通工具
some way off the island?

229
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,120
这里有很多船  但...
There are boats, but--

230
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,650
快逃离这个岛
Get yourself off this rock.

231
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,930
这里就要变成全球最大的靶子了
This whole place just became the biggest bull's-eye on the planet.

232
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,540
不是我笑你...
I'm sorry. It's just...

233
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,500
整个岛就是一座火山
This whole island is a volcano.

234
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,760
我们从小就听故事说
The stories we heard as kids,

235
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,550
海岛是用一枚巨大的鱼钩
they were about lands plucked from the bottom of the ocean

236
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,220
从海底钓起来的
by a giant fish hook

237
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,760
或是被愤怒的天神从天上扔下来的
or tossed down from the sky by angry gods.

238
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,430
你若对岛民说大难将至  人人死无全尸
Telling an islander they're going to die violently

239
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,830
他们会觉得自己的家乡一向如此
is just reminding us we're home.

240
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,040
淋浴收费10美元
Shower's $10.

241
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,180
我又没问
Didn't ask.

242
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,170
早晚会的
You will.

243
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,910
二位有何贵干
Gentlemen.

244
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:31,610
你也看到那架飞机了吧
You saw that plane?

245
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,560
没错
Yeah.

246
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,390
依我看  你们会遭遇到
I'd say you got yourself a bad case

247
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,430
七到十人的特种兵小队
of between seven and ten special forces.

248
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:37,620
基本肯定是三角洲部队
Almost certainly Delta.

249
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,960
你认为他们会先找我们还是先攻击潜艇
So you think they'll move for us or for the sub first?

250
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,270
艇长觉得你也许能帮助我们
My captain seems to think you might be of some help

251
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,650
想出一个应对方案
coming up with a plan here.

252
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:44,870
方案
A plan?

253
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,240
对  方案
Yeah, a plan.

254
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,690
不会有什么应对方案的
You're not coming up with a plan.

255
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,650
你们想出来的只会是个略复杂的自杀方式
What you're working on is just a really complicated suicide.

256
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,450
好吧  我实话跟你说吧
Okay, let me get one thing straight.

257
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,270
我只是应艇长的要求才来这儿的
I'm only here because my captain asked me to be.

258
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,240
要是我能做主  我宁愿一枪打爆自己的头
'Cause me? I'd rather beat my own brains out

259
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,840
也不要你的帮助
than have you help me with anything.

260
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:58,530
所以拜托你
So do me a favor.

261
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,080
继续泡在这里  争取越喝越傻
Why don't you stay here and drink yourself more stupid,

262
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,360
傻到无人能敌吧
if that's humanly possible?

263
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,360
谢谢帮忙
Thanks for your help.

264
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,990
还真挺解酒
That is good.

265
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,670
我们潜艇上的十三名水手
13 of our sailors are about

266
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,750
将在毫不了解敌方情况的状态下应战...
to face off with something they don't understand--

267
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,180
你知道完美的空降
Do you want to know what's the really great thing

268
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,780
最赞的一点是什么吗
about a perfect H.A.L.O. Jump?

269
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,860
在跳下去之前
It's that, before the jump,

270
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,670
你脑子里还想着家里的事
you're still stateside in your head--

271
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,350
房租  前女友  车贷等等
rent, ex-girlfriends, car payment, whatever.

272
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,270
但那自由落体的感觉会扫清一切烦恼
That free fall-- it cleans you right out.

273
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,710
在你拉开降落伞的那一刻
By the time you rip your chute,

274
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,970
所有的烦恼都消失了
everything's gone.

275
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,530
剩下的只有一股专注的力量
And what's left is a single-minded focus

276
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:36,850
驱使你完成任务
to accomplish the mission,

277
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,580
现在他们就带着这股力量来杀你和你的战友
which in this case would be killing you and your pals.

278
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,680
起码你可以告诉我们...
Look, the least you could do is tell--

279
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,900
如果要我选  我会站在他们那边
If I had to choose sides, I'd be out there with them.

280
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,840
所以
So this?

281
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,710
我只能说这么多了
This is the very least I can do.

282
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,900
根据我们的情报  会有特种兵进攻这座岛
So we think there might be some soldiers coming over the island.

283
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,250
既然你比任何人都熟悉这里
Since you know this place better than anyone,

284
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,480
我希望能得到你的帮助
I was hoping to get your help.

285
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,160
我觉得你还没搞清现在的形势吧
You know, I don't really think you get what's going on here, do you?

286
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,090
我很清楚
Oh, I do.

287
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:11,590
我为昨天死于非命的上百万人而惋惜
I understand that millions of people died yesterday.

288
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,230
但你会吗
But do you understand?

289
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,000
你不会
No, you can't.

290
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,360
因为你是一名士兵
Because you're a soldier.

291
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,690
军队告诉你  生命的逝去稀松平常
You're made to believe such things are normal.

292
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,460
你看电视报道了吗
Have you even looked at the TV?

293
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,710
你看到那些死者的脸了吗
Have you seen the faces--

294
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:22,940
我们潜艇可没有发射核弹
Hey, we're the ones that didn't fire.

295
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,150
明白吗
Do you get that?

296
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,440
你明白吗
Do you get it?

297
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:28,090
我和艇长没有向巴基斯坦发射核弹
Me and my captain, we didn't fire nukes at Pakistan.

298
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,290
你知道抗命不从的军人是什么下场吗
You know what the prize is for being such stand-up guys?

299
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,780
有人要杀我们  拦路者皆死
Men come to kill us and kill anyone that gets in their way.

300
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,150
我们现在唯一的胜算就是出奇制胜
And right now our only advantage is surprise.

301
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,790
所以我才来向你求助
And I'm here asking for your help.

302
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,790
副艇长  有电话找你
X.O., a call's come in for you.

303
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,240
我以为电话线路断了
I thought the phones were dead.

304
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,810
我们也以为  这电话你一定得接
So did we. You should take this.

305
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,150
喂
Hello.

306
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,780
亲爱的
Hey, babe.

307
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,140
我一直努力想再联系你  你还好吗
I've been trying to reach you again. Are you okay?

308
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,570
我知道  我知道
I know. I know.

309
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,240
这里发生了很多疯狂的事
Things have been pretty crazy here.

310
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,700
你那边也一样吧
And I bet for you, too, right?

311
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,530
克里斯蒂  告诉我  你还好吗
Christine, talk to me. Are you okay?

312
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,030
山姆  他们会对你既往不咎...
Sam, they'll give you full amnesty...

313
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:17,780
你还有艇员们
you and the crew.

314
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,520
只要你交出潜艇
All you have to do is give them the sub.

315
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,520
并交出马库斯
And you have to give them Marcus.

316
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,470
他们就会让你回来找我
They're ready to let you come back to me.

317
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,090
山姆
Sam...

318
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,690
别信他们
Don't trust them.

319
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,930
无论他们说什么
Whatever they say to you,

320
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,490
无论我说什么  都别信
whatever I say to you, don't trust it!

321
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:51,570
只需记住我爱你  山姆  我爱你
Just know that I love you, Sam! I love you!

322
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,020
我料到他们会软硬兼施
We knew this wouldn't just be bullets.

323
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,860
还会挑你内心最脆弱的地方下手
They'll come at you where it hurts the most.

324
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,610
还好吗
You okay?

325
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,090
我们到达内陆后  建立埋伏圈
We'll get inland and we'll set up a kill zone.

326
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,980
也许他们就会被请君入瓮
Maybe they walk right into it.

327
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,230
运气差的话  被识破  死的是我们
Worst-case scenario, they get wise, they kill us all.

328
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,750
运气好的话
Best-case scenario,

329
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,270
我们用装尸袋把一队美国军人送回老家
we send a complement of American body bags home.

330
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,800
不管怎样都糟透了
Either way, this sucks.

331
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,140
94年格罗兹尼巷战的时候
The siege of Grozny in '94.

332
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,240
2000名俄国军人死于同胞之手
2,000 Russians died fighting their own.

333
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,260
结果是  将军辞职  其他人被审判
In the aftermath, generals resigned, others were tried.

334
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,060
但是那成千上万的兄弟手足
But for days, they fought,

335
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:07,050
在冰天雪地里互相残杀的日子里
brother killing brother by the thousands in the freezing cold.

336
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:09,000
如何能扪心自问这是为什么
And you have to ask yourself why.

337
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,750
有时候  敌人
Sometimes the enemy

338
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,160
仅仅是阻碍你回家的人
is just the man keeping you from getting home.

339
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,590
作为冷战的象征
A symbol of the cold war,

340
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:28,900
这艘俄亥俄级潜艇是18个同级别潜艇之一
the Ohio class submarine is one of 18 in its class

341
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,880
可以匿迹潜形  给敌人致命一击
designed to run silent and deep and then deliver deathly...

342
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:33,630
我出20美元赌24小时内这家伙准完蛋
20 bucks says we take this guy out within 24 hours.

343
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,160
一枚巡航导弹了事  谁要赌
Cruise missile. Who's in?

344
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,300
你个脑科大夫懂什么
Hey, brain surgeon.

345
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,030
科罗拉多号5分钟之内
The "Colorado" can launch

346
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,390
就可以发射剩余17枚核弹
its remaining 17 nukes in under five minutes.

347
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,200
你说的巡航导弹慢的要死
Your cruise missile is a slow weapon.

348
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,320
大概得用20分钟才能击中目标
Takes maybe 20 minutes.

349
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,520
洲际导弹快一点  但是得先上太空再降下来
I.C.B.M.'s faster, but you gotta launch it up and down.

350
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,470
这也要花时间
That takes time.

351
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,610
还不能确保彻底解决了那潜艇
And you better be 100% sure you kill her,

352
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,010
因为查普林现在占领了北约雷达站
'cause Chaplin's got eyes now.

353
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,900
一旦科罗拉多号的三叉戟导弹升空
And once the "Colorado's" tridents are airborne,

354
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,780
世界上没有任何东西能够阻止它们
there is not a thing in this world that stops them

355
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,970
因为20年前有人阻止了我爸
'cause somebody kept my daddy

356
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,480
实行星球大战计划
from building star wars 20 years ago.

357
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:00,310
告诉我  你到底要怎么把那艘潜艇消灭掉
So tell me exactly how you would take out that submarine?

358
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,750
莱纳斯
Linus.

359
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,240
我最爱的国防部卧底
What is my favorite deep cover mole

360
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,890
今晚喝点什么
in the defense department drinking this evening?

361
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,330
-看在上帝的份上  凯莉  -放轻松
- For God's sake, Kylie. - Oh, relax.

362
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,590
今天我就算现场给你跳个大腿舞
I could give you a lap dance right here

363
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,260
也没人会注意到的
and no one would notice today.

364
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,350
我会的
I would.

365
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:14,920
有什么消息吗
So what's your news?

366
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,960
你那个珀尔修斯样机
Your Perseus prototype?

367
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:20,770
查普林今天早上亲自试用了
Chaplin went ahead and tested it this morning, on his own.

368
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,970
科罗拉多号立即从所有雷达屏幕上消失了
The "Colorado" dropped right off everyone's screens.

369
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,910
凯莉  样机奏效了
Kylie, it works.

370
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,310
服务生  上香槟
Waiter, champagne.

371
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,830
现在就上  我们要庆祝
Right away. We're celebrating.

372
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,230
不  不  你不明白
No, no, no, no. You don't understand.

373
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,330
他们会把你的这项专利抢走的
They will take it away from you.

374
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,170
以爱国行为为由  或是以国家安全为由
They will go patriot act, they will go national security,

375
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,380
永远地从你手里夺走它
and they will take it away from you.

376
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,180
而你毫无办法
And there's nothing you can do about it.

377
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,780
查普林说  曾试图击沉科罗拉多号的
Chaplin said it was actually the "Illinois"

378
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,040
是伊利诺伊号
that tried to sink the "Colorado."

379
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,060
查普林疯了
Chaplin's insane.

380
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,220
是吗  24小时前  你会说
Really? 24 hours ago, you would've said

381
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,740
他是忠贞爱国  道德高尚的典范
he was the paragon of virtue and patriotism.

382
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,100
现在有人命令伊利诺伊号开火
Now someone ordered the "Illinois" to fire.

383
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,150
这命令一定记载在案  如果你说的对
Somewhere that was recorded, and if you're right

384
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,230
他们要夺走我的技术发明专利
and they're trying to take my tech,

385
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,770
那么那条命令就是我的免罪金牌
then that order is my get-out-of-jail-free card.

386
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,030
我要你为我拿到它
I need you to get that for me.

387
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:57,920
你听我说话了吗
Are you not hearing me?

388
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,390
我不能再帮你了
I can't help you anymore.

389
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:01,980
你单身派对上
What was the name

390
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,420
那个咖啡色头发的女人叫什么来着
of that brunette at your bachelor party?

391
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,150
太性感了
God, she was hot.

392
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,730
性感到让我想左右开弓
Like, make-me-want-to-switch-hit hot,

393
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:08,360
是她吗
wasn't she?

394
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,370
叫凯洛的女孩
Was it Carole?

395
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:12,560
啊不是  那是你妻子的名字
Oh, no. No, no. That's your wife's name.

396
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,110
我还以为我们是朋友
I thought we were friends.

397
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,390
我们是朋友啊
We are friends.

398
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,860
但是你是我付过很多钱的朋友
But you're a friend I pay a lot of money to.

399
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,610
莱纳斯  去把那条命令找来给我
Linus, go find me that order.

400
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,020
再见  爸爸
Good-bye, dad.

401
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,630
我敢说你并没想到会有这样的周末
I bet this isn't how you saw your weekend going.

402
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:37,170
我的周末并没有你想象的那么无聊
My weekends are not as boring as you imagine.

403
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,370
好吧  是我没想到我的周末会这样
Yeah. Well, it isn't how I saw mine.

404
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,210
我当时在场
I was there.

405
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,850
如果你当时不杀掉那个人  我们都死定了
If you hadn't killed that man, we'd all be dead.

406
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,180
你别无选择
You didn't have a choice.

407
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,550
现在也无关紧要了  不是吗
It doesn't matter now, does it?

408
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,190
谢帕德杀死了我们其中的一员
Shepard killed one of us.

409
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,560
有时在战场上
Sometimes in battle,

410
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,240
这种事情总能合理的存在
these things have a way of working themselves out.

411
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,630
抱歉  凯姆  上面才更需要你
Sorry, Cam, you're too important up there.

412
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,420
恕我冒犯  长官
With all due respect, sir.

413
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,550
如果这行动不成功  上面也保不住
If this doesn't work, there will be no "up there."

414
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,830
整装待发了  长官
Full complement ready to go, sir.

415
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,640
很好
Good.

416
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,700
出去要小心  别晒伤了
Careful out there. Don't get a sunburn.

417
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:40,930
你用不着这个  这个还有这
You don't need this or this or this.

418
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,240
还没等你
This will get you shot

419
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,800
摘下这玩意  人家就把你崩了
while you're busy trying to unstrap it.

420
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,490
你倒是把装具带穿对了
You got your rig strapped right.

421
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,030
但这不代表你准备好迎接那里的一切
Doesn't mean you're ready for what's out there.

422
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,490
有一条他们要到这里的必经之路
There is a place they will have to go through to get here.

423
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,600
我来指给你
I'll show you where.

424
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:10,930
可以走了
That's all.

425
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,470
协助和鼓动恐怖组织
Aiding and abetting a terrorist enterprise,

426
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,340
协助和鼓动恐怖份子
aiding and abetting known terrorists,

427
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,600
煽动叛乱罪  叛国罪
sedition, treason,

428
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,960
协助和鼓动攻击祖国
aiding and abetting an attack on the homeland--

429
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,380
这可不只关系到你丈夫
And this isn't just your husband.

430
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,550
刚才一通闹  现在连你自己也搭进去了
After that stunt, this is now you as well.

431
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,450
看见中指了吗
Read between the lines.

432
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,270
你以为你了解他
You think you know him?

433
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,440
其实不然
You don't.

434
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:32,050
你了解的不过是单纯的表面
You just know the easy parts,

435
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,410
他故意秀给你看的部分
the parts he wanted you to see.

436
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,870
我比任何人都了解山姆
I know Sam better than anyone.

437
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,350
你确定
You sure?

438
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,570
我不会谈这个的
I'm not gonna talk about that.

439
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,010
我说了不想谈这个
I told you I'm not gonna talk about it

440
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:41,910
所以我不会谈的
so we're not talking about it.

441
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:42,830
这是什么
What is this?

442
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:45,020
你们18个人被俘
There were 18 of you taken prisoner.

443
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,770
这是什么时候录的  什么东西
When was this taken? What is this?

444
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,850
你手下有7人未能生还
Seven men under your command didn't survive.

445
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:50,260
到底发生了什么
What the hell is going on?

446
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,780
你不会没有压力的
That has to weigh on you.

447
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,070
我很惊讶你能来
I was surprised you showed.

448
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,720
我也是
So am I.

449
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,270
你要对付的这些人
These men you're ready to fight,

450
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,060
他们也是你的同胞
they might as well be your brothers.

451
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,630
好了  我知道
Hey, you know, I get it.

452
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,760
你讨厌杀戮  厌恶战争
You don't like killing, you don't like war,

453
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,520
希望大家都相安无事
you want us to all just get along.

454
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,140
是个人都这么想
That's what anybody thinks

455
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,840
因为他们没被逼得走投无路
that's never had their back up against a wall.

456
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,730
你以为我是谁
Who do you think I am?

457
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,060
我见识了你们的战争所带来的
I've seen what your wars do.

458
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,750
而且这些战争都是可以避免的
And there's always some other way.

459
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,210
对  我以前也是这么想的
Yeah, I used to think that, too.

460
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:23,900
我错了
I was wrong.

461
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:26,300
是什么让你改变了看法
What happened to change your mind?

462
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,820
谢谢你给我们指路
Thank you for showing us this spot.

463
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,810
你该走了
You should go now.

464
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,140
能帮我检查一下武器吗
Can you check my weapon for me?

465
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,490
我想确保它就绪了
I want to make sure it's ready.

466
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,120
谢谢长官
Thank you, ma'am.

467
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,890
我心里更踏实了
I feel much safer now.

468
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,550
你就这么让他们自己去了
You just let them go off alone.

469
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,490
我管不着
It's not my business.

470
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,280
在圣玛丽娜这座岛上
Here on sainte marina,

471
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:20,050
有时因为家庭离异
sometimes a family breaks apart--

472
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:22,640
婚姻恶化  欠债不还
a marriage goes bad, a debt goes unpaid,

473
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,000
会有一些小争端
a small war starts.

474
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,230
别担心  我不会浪费这香料的
Don't worry. I'm not gonna break out the patchouli.

475
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,260
在这里  这些事情发生的时候
But here when this happens,

476
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,060
我们要选出一个人  给他纹饰
a man is selected and marked

477
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,490
任命他来解决争端
to make the peace.

478
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,210
这纹饰是一项荣耀
The marks are an honor.

479
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:40,970
你担当得起来吗
Do you deserve them?

480
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,860
他们凌晨三四点的时候来
It would be 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning when they would come.

481
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,290
把我们拖出牢房
They'd drag us out of our cells.

482
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,890
在院子里执行枪决
They would march us out into the yard.

483
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:52,750
是一起吗
Together?

484
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:54,870
不  一个一个来
Mnh-mnh. Alone.

485
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:58,160
有张桌子  一支枪一颗子弹
There would be a table and gun. One bullet.

486
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,700
他们会让你自己填弹
They'd make you load the gun.

487
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,350
他们转一下弹轮把枪口指向你
They'd spin the chamber and put the gun to your head.

488
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:04,900
咔
Click.

489
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,170
那扣扳机的声音
That sound...

490
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,650
你的丈夫曾在
Your husband was a captive

491
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:12,070
北朝鲜人民共和国
of the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea

492
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,690
做过17天俘虏
for over 17 days.

493
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,080
不  那不可能
No, that's not possible.

494
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,120
马库斯・查普林采取了非常规手段
Marcus Chaplin went off the reservation

495
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,550
使他得以被释放
to force his release.

496
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,480
为此还赌上了自己的前途
Put his career on the line.

497
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,630
山姆告诉你那是一次常规部署吗
Sam just tell you that was a regular deployment?

498
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,760
男人为什么要对自己的妻子撒谎呢
Why does a man lie to his wife?

499
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:26,970
我不知道
I don't know.

500
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,500
马库斯指使他骗了你
Well, Marcus had him lying to you,

501
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,320
骗了所有人
to everyone.

502
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,650
如果他能做出这种事
And if he's capable of that,

503
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,530
天知道马库斯还能怂恿他做出什么别的事
what else could Marcus get him to do?

504
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,120
你以为你丈夫就骗过你这一回吗
You think that's the only lie your husband ever told you?

505
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,790
我不知道  好了吧
I don't know, okay?

506
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,560
你为什么不告诉我  因为我真的不知道
Why don't you tell me? Because I don't know what this is.

507
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:47,310
我失去了7名部下  你问我他们的名字
I lost seven of my men. You want their names?

508
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,110
听着  事情都过去了  我都忘了
Look, it happened. I'm over it.

509
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,300
能换个话题吗
Could we move on, please?

510
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:52,510
这就是你的丈夫
That's your husband...

511
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,390
正在学着撒谎
Learning to lie.

512
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,610
国防部副部长科利
Deputy Secretary of Defense Curry,

513
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,900
很高兴再次与你通话
it's good to talk to you again.

514
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,170
现在是部长了  艇长
It's Secretary now, Captain.

515
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,770
至少过去的24小时对某些人来说是好事
Well, I'm glad the last 24 hours has been good to someone.

516
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,730
听着  我们这里有很多人被吓坏了
You know, we have a lot of frightened people here.

517
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,330
你们派出了一支三角洲小队进入我的岛屿
You have a team of Delta on my island.

518
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,790
我希望他们离开  马上
I want them gone. Now.

519
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:16,030
我们需要面对16亿愤怒的穆斯林
We got about 1.6 billion Muslims deeply pissed at us.

520
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,740
我们正试图使事态得到缓解
We're trying to de-escalate this situation,

521
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,580
而非步步升级
not make it worse.

522
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:21,790
你的岛上没有三角特遣队  完毕
There are no Delta on your island. Over.

523
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,200
谁会射击
So who can shoot?

524
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,520
我是说真的能射中目标
I mean actually hit something.

525
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,450
我可以吧
I suppose I can.

526
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,620
好的
Okay.

527
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:34,890
算了  我大概也行
Ah, hell. Guess I can, too.

528
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:35,630
好的
Good.

529
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,820
战斗打响后  他们会向后撤
When this starts, they're either gonna fall back

530
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,270
或者向掩体移动
or try to make it to cover.

531
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,410
你们要阻止他们
You do not let them.

532
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,480
懂了吗
You got it?

533
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,440
很好
Good.

534
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,710
副艇长  我们已经就位
X.O., we're all set up here.

535
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,740
你认为还有多长时间
How long do you think we have?

536
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,170
一小时左右  但随时做好准备
Probably an hour or more, but be ready.

537
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,710
这感觉一定很怪吧  杀自己人
Must feel weird, killing one of your own,

538
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,630
尤其还是在他们毫不知情的情况下
especially like this, without them knowing it's coming.

539
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,500
听着  霍克斯
Hey, Hawkes,

540
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,390
我们现在需要每一支枪
we're gonna need every gun we have.

541
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:02,500
所以如果你想打黑枪杀了我
So if you're gonna shoot me in the back,

542
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,160
最好等打完仗再说
maybe you could wait until we're done here.

543
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:13,450
整个区域都在火力范围内
We've got the whole thing ranged.

544
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,820
如果他们来  我们能够应付
If they come, we'll take 'em.

545
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,100
很好
Good.

546
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,240
副艇长
X.O...

547
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,830
上尉  有朝一日你会结婚吧
You gonna get married someday, lieutenant?

548
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:22,570
那些人就要来了
'cause these men are coming,

549
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,500
不是他们死  就是你死
and only one of you gets to have a future.

550
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,190
我还挺想参加你的婚礼呢
I plan on being at that wedding.

551
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,500
我会确保你收到请柬  长官
I'll make sure and invite you, sir.

552
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,970
隐蔽  迅速隐蔽
Go, quick. Go.

553
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,150
艇长  他们来了
Captain, they're here.

554
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:44,300
如果我们还想留条后路  现在是最后的机会
If we're gonna find another way out of this, it's gotta be now.

555
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,980
山姆  现在你得靠自己
You're on your own for now, Sam.

556
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,180
我还帮不上你
I can't help you yet.

557
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,890
科利部长
Secretary Curry,

558
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,410
再告诉我一遍  你们没派部队上我的岛
tell me again how you have nothing on my island.

559
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,720
那我又如何能想象出我的副艇长正准备
Tell me how I'm imaging my X.O. is going up against

560
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,060
和一只武装小队交火
an armed contingent.

561
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,770
如果我觉得你是在骗我  那就别无选择
And if I think you're lying to me, then I'm gonna have to

562
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:07,120
只能让老天决定事态发展了
leave this in the hands of a higher power.

563
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,110
打扰一下  先生
Excuse me, sir.

564
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,460
你想让我说什么  马库斯
Wh-what do you want me to say, Marcus?

565
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,660
是  我们派了特遣队  不  我们没有
Yes, we sent Delta? No, we didn't send Delta?

566
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,610
现在我说什么都没用了吧
Does it really matter what I say?

567
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:17,010
不要射击
Hold your fire.

568
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,170
不要射击
Hold your fire.

569
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:24,520
长官
Sir?

570
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,860
我已瞄准目标
I have the shot.

571
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:26,910
长官
Sir?

572
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:35,110
我要出来对话  我没带武器
I'm coming out to talk! I am unarmed!

573
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:37,930
重复一遍  我没带武器  我要出来对话
I repeat, I am unarmed! I'm coming out to talk!

574
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,000
不要开枪
Do not fire!

575
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,140
长官  你在干什么
Sir... what are you doing?

576
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,550
我们已从两翼将你们包围
We got you ranged from both sides.

577
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,610
你们处于火力范围内
You are in a kill zone.

578
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,570
我只想和你们谈谈
I just want to talk.

579
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,070
我们都是美国人  你们之中肯定有人
We are all Americans. At least some of you

580
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,990
会怀疑你们到底来这里干什么
gotta be wondering what you're doing here.

581
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,000
我更不知道我来这儿干吗
Hell, I don't even know what I'm doing here.

582
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,880
又出现了
There it is again.

583
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:12,310
他们正通过水下
They're essentially beaming it through the water

584
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,320
从基地向分队发射信号
from their base to the team

585
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,380
然后利用超低频信道
and then using an ultra-low frequency.

586
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,310
谁在通过水下发射信号
Who is beaming it through the water?

587
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:18,800
他们
They are.

588
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,200
我只知道  我们今天不必造成任何牺牲
All I know is, none of us has to die today.

589
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:26,500
山姆  他们不是三角洲部队的
Sam, they're not Deltas.

590
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,020
他们是俄罗斯特战队的
They're Russian Spetsnaz.

591
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,290
山姆  收到吗
Sam, do you read?

592
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,110
我靠
Ah, hell.

593
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,230
三个撤到后面了  前面还有两个
Three went back! Two forward!

594
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,490
我们有两个人...
We got two but--

595
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:53,540
格蕾丝  敌军正要迂回
Grace, they flanked us

596
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,680
试图登上你们所在的山坡
to the top of the hill you're on.

597
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,060
你们最好先往上走
You gotta get up there.

598
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,600
我们已经在路上了
We're already on our way.

599
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:02,680
但现在被敌人压制  山姆
But we're pinned down, Sam.

600
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,380
没法上山
There is no way up.

601
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,960
我们这样下去没活路的  上尉
We're not gonna survive like this, lieutenant.

602
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,680
我命令你去占领那个位置
I need you to take that position out.

603
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,810
听到吗
Do you hear me?

604
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:12,620
霍克斯
Hawkes.

605
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,390
霍克斯  需要掩护
Hawkes, we need cover.

606
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,570
不要
No!

607
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,430
声音关小  水手
Turn that down, sailor.

608
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,390
长官
Sir?

609
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,840
你听到了  关小音量
You heard me. Turn it down.

610
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,210
马库斯・查普林
Marcus Chaplin.

611
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,280
什么风把您吹来了
This is an unexpected honor.

612
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,560
维克多  你有一支特战队在我岛上
Viktor, you have a team of Spetsnaz on my island,

613
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,050
从台湾的747客机上跳伞后登陆
dropped off the back of a taiwanese 747.

614
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,150
并从我禁区外50英里的乌克兰货船上
You're running support off a Ukrainian container ship

615
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:45,900
向其提供指挥支援
50 miles beyond my perimeter.

616
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,560
可能这不是你的行动  维克多
And it might not be your mission, Viktor.

617
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,790
但克里姆林宫里有人正企图得到我的潜艇
But someone in the Kremlin is making a play for my submarine.

618
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,650
没人想要发动攻击
No one would want to attack.

619
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:53,910
我会下令击沉那艘船的  维克多
I'll sink the ship, Viktor.

620
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,000
然后对准塞瓦斯托波尔基地
And then I'll target the Sevastopol base

621
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,550
也就是你两个儿子服役的基地
where your two sons are stationed

622
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,260
将那里夷为平地
and I'll turn it to glass.

623
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,640
格蕾丝  立刻告诉我
Grace, I need to know right now,

624
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,940
你能否攻下那个高地
can you take care of that position or not?!

625
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,270
抱歉  山姆
I'm sorry, Sam.

626
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:18,270
抱歉
I'm sorry.

627
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,300
俄方打出信号  希望进行谈判
Russians are signaling, they want to talk.

628
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,690
给我接通科利的电话
Get Curry back on the line.

629
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,930
让他听听这一切  但要把这混蛋搁静音
Let him hear everything, but mute that son of a bitch.

630
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,400
马库斯
Marcus,

631
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,180
这边很多人已经睡着了
many people are asleep here.

632
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,090
事情不好办
It's not easy.

633
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:36,160
没关系  维克多
That's okay, Viktor.

634
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,750
我随时奉陪
I've got all the time in the world.

635
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,500
无线电坏了  所有人听好
Radio's dead. Everybody listen up.

636
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,290
我一下令  你们就去卡车那里
On my go, you're gonna get to the truck

637
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,540
然后离开这儿
and get the hell out of here.

638
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,620
如有人倒下  其他人继续前进
One of you guys go down, you just keep moving.

639
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,480
听我口令
On my go.

640
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,630
瑞德  瑞德
Red. Red.

641
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:51,750
我们准备行动  听到了吗
We're gonna do this. Do you hear me?

642
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,600
才23米不到  明白吗
It's not more than 25 yards. Do you understand me?

643
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,480
我做不到  我做不到
I can't. I can't.

644
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,260
抱歉  我做不到
I'm sorry. I can't.

645
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,520
维克多  那孩子叫什么名字
Viktor, what is that kid's name...

646
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:05,890
就那天你船上的那个
on your boat back in the day?

647
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,830
在冰下吓坏了的那个
The one who got so freaked out under the ice.

648
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,730
我们中断冷战一个小时
You and I called off the cold war for an hour

649
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,080
让你救他上来
so you could get him topside.

650
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:14,590
这叫信任
That's called trust.

651
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,220
是尼古拉
Ah, Nikolai.

652
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,460
海军上将的儿子
Admiral's son.

653
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:20,550
马库斯
Marcus,

654
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,860
这话就我们两个老兵间说说
just between two old warriors,

655
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:27,440
看在我们都有人出生入死的份上
let's say for argument's sake we had our people there.

656
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,690
或许你可以交出潜艇
Maybe you could surrender your submarine.

657
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:32,740
这样也许就不会有任何伤亡了
Maybe then nobody would have to be hurt.

658
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:36,220
维克多  我是国防部部长科利
Viktor! This is Secretary of Defense Curry.

659
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,840
你已经开始行动  这是我们内部的冲突
You put a play in motion? This is our conflict.

660
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,750
除非你想引发第三次世界大战
Unless you want to start World War III,

661
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,450
立即撤回这些人
you pull those men back now.

662
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:44,080
我还以为你是个守信用的人
And I thought you were a man of your word.

663
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,610
我并没有给你任何承诺  维克多
I didn't give you my word, Viktor.

664
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,460
但我会让你和国防部部长科利
But I'll let you work out the ramifications

665
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:50,160
去解决窃取美国潜艇的问题
of trying to steal a U.S. Sub with SecDef Curry.

666
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:54,280
我算了一下
I did the math.

667
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,940
我们谈恋爱两年  结婚一年
We dated two years. Married one.

668
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:01,850
但我们真正在一起的时间只有124天
Yet, we have actually only spent 124 days together.

669
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,150
你算过吗
You did the math?

670
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,560
你是谁  山姆・肯德尔
Who are you, Sam Kendal?

671
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,940
我们会好好的
We're gonna be okay.

672
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,200
你想要什么
What do you want?

673
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,440
我只想要你
I just want you.

674
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,640
副艇长
X.O.

675
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:12,890
副艇长
X.O.!

676
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,090
你没必要这么做
You don't have to do this.

677
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,730
快走  走
Go, go, go, go!

678
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,880
不能死  今天不能死
Don't die. Not today.

679
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,060
不能死
Don't die.

680
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,690
副艇长  听到请回答
X.O., are you there?

681
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,360
副艇长
X.O.

682
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,300
剩余的俄国人都已撤退
Remaining Russians have bugged out.

683
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,950
我们五人阵亡  格蕾丝负伤
We lost five. Grace is wounded.

684
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,280
但伤得不重
She'll be okay.

685
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,780
我们俘获两人  正在回来的路上
We have two prisoners. We're coming home.

686
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,220
很可能是浪费时间
Probably a waste of time.

687
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,560
你真觉得你能打破这份信仰吗
You really think you can break that kind of devotion?

688
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:36,640
她有信念  坠入了爱河
Well, she's got faith. She's in love.

689
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,810
但这些都是可矫正的
But both those things are curable.

690
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:40,960
那就矫正她
Then cure her.

691
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,000
我已经见到她了
Okay, I'm here with her now.

692
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:53,590
克里斯蒂
Christine...

693
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,740
我是保罗・威尔斯
My name is Paul Wells.

694
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,800
我们一直在找你
We've been trying to find you.

695
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,910
你还记得我吗
Do you remember me?

696
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,280
你是山姆的朋友
You're Sam's friend.

697
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,810
是的  从大学开始
Yes. Yes, from college.

698
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:10,030
我是一名律师
Look, I'm a lawyer, okay?

699
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,170
政府已经
The government has...

700
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:14,070
彻底越权了
radically exceeded its authority here.

701
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,100
一切到此为止
But that all stops now.

702
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:19,730
来吧
Come on.

703
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,290
我带你回家
Let me take you home.

704
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:53,090
好的  把他们关起来
All right, lock 'em up.

705
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:54,040
天哪  别这样
Oh, hell, no.

706
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,920
他们杀了我们五个弟兄  五个
They killed five of us, man. Yeah, five.

707
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,490
我们的五个朋友  五个战友
Five of our friends, five of our people.

708
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,510
这些人已经没用了
These guys get wasted.

709
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,620
立刻放下你的武器
Put your weapon down right now!

710
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,260
瑞德  这是命令  放下武器
Red, that is an order! Put it down!

711
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:04,940
什么命令
An order?

712
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,140
我们是在一个破岛上  不是在潜艇里
We're on a damn island, not a sub.

713
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,400
请原谅
So excuse me

714
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,770
我已经不知道命令意味着什么了
If I'm not even sure what an order means anymore!

715
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,810
我知道这并不是你们想要的
I know you didn't ask for this.

716
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,210
我知道你们都很害怕
I know you're all scared.

717
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:18,760
你们想知道我们到底在这里做什么
And you're wondering what we're doing here

718
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,040
还有你们怎么才能回家
and how you're gonna get back home.

719
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,110
现在你们失去了朋友
And now you've lost friends.

720
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:24,000
心中充满着杀戮欲
And you have bloodlust in your hearts.

721
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:26,110
也许复仇能带给你一丝满足
Vengeance might give you some satisfaction,

722
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,290
但我要提醒你们  记得自己的身份
but let me remind you who you are.

723
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:33,150
你们是俄亥俄级弹道导弹潜艇
You are the American crew

724
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:37,040
科罗拉多号上的美国军人
of the Ohio class ballistic missile submarine "Colorado."

725
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:39,370
你的领口上标注着你的军衔
Your rank is what it says on your collar.

726
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:41,000
你们懂得要向长官敬礼
You salute the sailor above you...

727
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:44,240
也希望下属能对你如此
And you expect the same of the one below.

728
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,910
你最终的职责就是当我说"跳"时
And your final duty is to say "How high?"

729
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,950
你问"要跳多高"
when I say "Jump."

730
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,180
明白了吗
Are we clear?

731
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:52,020
-是的  长官  -是的  长官
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

732
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,100
明白了吗
Are we clear?!

733
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,090
是的  长官
Yes, sir.

734
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,460
作为美国人
Now as Americans,

735
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,580
对战俘的处理无需争议
there's no debate about the fate of our P.O.W.S.

736
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,370
谢帕德上尉
Lieutenant shepard,

737
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,490
关押囚犯
secure the prisoners.

738
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,720
我知道你干了什么
I know what you did.

739
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:31,860
再试一次  我仍会活着回来
Try it again. I'll still be here.

740
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,260
马库斯
Marcus!

741
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:44,340
告诉他们我们还是兄弟时你对我说过的话
Tell them what you told me when we were still pals.

742
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,790
告诉他们你的儿子两周前在阿富汗
Tell them that your son got killed by friendly fire

743
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,860
被友军误杀
two weeks ago in Afghanistan.

744
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,760
说啊
Go on.

745
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,200
这些年轻人已经跟着你下了地狱
These young people have followed you into a hell.

746
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,390
永世不得超生
They'll never be able to climb back out of.

747
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,770
为了什么
For what?

748
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:03,500
就是因为你想报复这个
Because you wanted payback on the country

749
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,210
害死了你儿子国家
that took your son away from you?!

750
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:08,390
把真相告诉他们  马库斯
Tell 'em the truth, Marcus!

751
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,390
告诉他们到底是为何而战
Tell them what they're really fighting for!

752
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,130
你了解我  乔
You know me, Joe.

753
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:20,500
你们所有人
All of you...

754
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,530
都了解我
You know me.

755
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,000
再来一杯给我
One more for me.

756
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,540
一杯给这位脸蛋受伤的女士
One more for the lady with the, uh, face.

757
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,860
你觉得我是来感谢你吗
You think I came to thank you?

758
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,250
我们损失了六个人
We lost six people.

759
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,970
我觉得也许你想知道他们的名字
I thought you might want to know their names.

760
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:11,010
在我身边牺牲的战友  比这要多得多
I got my own list a lot longer than that.

761
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,170
终有一天  你得搞清楚
One of these days, you're gonna have to decide

762
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:17,390
自己到底信仰什么
what you believe in.

763
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,050
看见战友倒下是什么感觉
What did it feel like?

764
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,180
脑子里不停地嗡嗡作响吧
It's a hell of a buzz, isn't it?

765
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:33,230
你可能没意识到  但你今天的确很了不起
You may not know it, but you did something today.

766
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,050
你是和平卫士
Peace...maker.

767
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,870
塔妮  你以为我是为和平而战吗
You think I made the peace, Tani?

768
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,140
我只不过是好久没杀人了
I just ran out of people to kill.

769
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,360
今天国会刮起了一阵
The so-called "Pledge of allegiance"

770
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,680
对祖国宣誓效忠的风潮
swept through congress today

771
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,560
国会议员们纷纷表示愿意支持总统
as legislators lined up in support of the president,

772
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,360
尽管白宫此次发动的
even as international condemnation mounts

773
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:51,830
所谓"箭在弦上不得不发"的攻击行为
for the attack the white house has called

774
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:53,840
引发了国际舆论的强烈谴责
"Necessary and unavoidable."

775
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,320
终于来了
Oh, finally.

776
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,740
我已经办妥了  你进行得如何
I did my part. How about...

777
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,900
他们说这是对所吃食物的过敏反应
They said it was an allergic reaction to something he ate.

778
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,180
但当他被送到医院的时候
But by the time they got to him,

779
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,150
大脑已经缺氧十分钟了
his brain had been without oxygen for ten minutes.

780
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:17,130
这怎么可能是意外呢
So how could that be an accident?

781
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:20,060
是你把他害成这样的
It's your fault, isn't it?

782
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:25,450
你笑着向他承诺能挣一笔大钱
You smiled and promised him so much money.

783
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,360
知道吗  他曾对我说  "你真该见见她
You know, he used to say, "You should see her.

784
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,380
她似乎所向披靡"
It's like nothing can touch her."

785
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,280
说的没错  你的确毫发未伤
It's true, isn't it? Nothing touches you.

786
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,970
我祝你孤身终老
I hope you die alone.

787
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:00,870
我派了两支搜救小组去找布兰伦和科泰兹
We've got two teams looking for Brannan and Cortez.

788
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,510
如果他们还活着  一定能把他们带回来
If they're out there to be found, we'll find them.

789
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:14,590
我记得那是7月出海执行任务
I think it was July deployment.

790
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:17,610
你马上就要来艇上进行总体验收了
You're due any minute for general inspection,

791
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:21,040
可当时的情况...实在是糟糕透顶
and, man...it's not good.

792
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:24,090
凯姆安装的新型声呐系统根本无法使用
Cam's got some new sonar display that's not even working.

793
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:26,010
而炊事员在食堂不小心弄炸了
The cook, he's got, like, 200 cans of stew

794
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,070
200个炖菜罐头  那浓郁的味道
that exploded in the mess and the smell...

795
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,060
遍布整个潜艇
the smell is everywhere.

796
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:33,910
忽然之间  艇长来了  你出现了
And here comes the captain. Here you come.

797
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:35,100
大家都惊慌不已
Everybody's freaking out

798
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,710
害怕这无比混乱的景象会让你大发雷霆
because the place is a complete disaster.

799
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,380
然而  在接下来的两小时中
Except instead, for two hours,

800
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,010
你一直微笑着  轻拍着大家的后背
you're all smiles and back slaps.

801
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:44,670
还给我们讲述了你当年在洛杉矶级
You told some story about fishing off the back

802
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,690
攻击型核潜艇顶上钓鱼的事
of an L.A. Class attack sub.

803
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,770
终于  出海的时刻到了
Finally, it's time to put to sea.

804
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,450
我去找克里斯蒂  向她告别
I find Christine and I say good-bye.

805
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:56,990
是啊  你当时刚刚新婚...
Yeah, you'd been married...

806
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,050
才3个礼拜吧
three weeks?

807
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:02,840
我登上舰桥  与你并肩而立
I join you on the bridge,

808
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:07,820
看到你脸上洋溢着傻憨憨的笑容
and you got this big dumb smile plastered all over your face--

809
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,430
毫无艇长的威严
totally undignified.

810
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:17,580
杰弗里也在码头上
And Jeffrey's there on the pier.

811
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,430
那是他第一次从国外服役归来
He's home from his first tour.

812
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:24,670
他来目送自己的父亲出海
He's there to watch his old man pull out to sea.

813
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,760
长官  把手给我
Give me your dumb hand, sir.

814
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,450
你所承受的苦痛  是我无法想象的
I can't imagine what you're going through.

815
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:51,110
但我是你的朋友
But I am your friend.

816
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:53,670
我了解你
And I know who you are.

817
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,070
我相信你
And I trust you.

818
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,740
他们会找准你心中最深切的痛楚
They find what hurts you the most

819
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,610
想借此把你彻底打垮
and they try to break you with it.

820
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:10,040
但他们永远不会得逞
But that's where they miss.

821
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,840
因为最深的痛楚  正是激励我们的力量
What hurts us the most, that's our strength.

822
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,360
正是支撑我们抗争到底的勇气
That's what gets us through.

823
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:57,850
我特别激动
I'm excited.

824
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,110
你也是军人  一定理解我的心情
And I know you of all people, you get that.

825
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,240
等我到了那边  再跟你联系
I'll tell you stories on the other side.

826
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:04,310
我爱你  老爸
I love you, dad.

827
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:07,110
爸爸
Hi, dad.

828
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,430
我希望你永远不用看到这录像
I hope you never have to watch this.

829
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:11,780
真希望以前能让你有机会更好地了解我
I wish that I had let you know me better.

830
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:14,080
因为那样你就能懂得我现在有多么恐惧
If I had, then you would know how scared I am.

831
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,760
但你也知道我绝不会就此退缩
But you would also know that I'm not gonna run from this.

832
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,330
我不是那种人
That's not who I am.

833
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,630
我爱你  爸爸
I love you, dad.

834
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,110
你的意思是
You've indicated that

835
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:39,050
你不会向你的妻子倾诉这些
you're not going to tell your wife about this.

836
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:40,060
这是为什么
Why is that?

837
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,060
因为在那些黑暗的日子里
The whole time I was there,

838
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,660
克里斯蒂是支撑我活下去的唯一动力
Christine's what kept me alive.

839
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:45,870
你想知道我为何不把那些事告诉她
You want to know why I'm not gonna tell my wife?

840
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,050
因为在我的世界里  她是唯一的美好
'Cause she's the one good thing I got left in this world.

841
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:51,740
也许正是因为这样  我就得继续保密
Maybe this way, I get to keep that.

《破釜沉舟》前情提要

6
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,060
自己人居然想击沉我们
Our own people tried to sink us?

7
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:06,900
违抗军令  你说还会是什么下场
What do you think happens when you ignore orders?

8
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,840
这不是违抗军令  只是请求解释
We didn't ignore anything. We questioned.

00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,480
老海军中流行这么一句话  
Old navy saying--

10
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,610
"愚人必自食恶果"
"Stupid will be punished."

11
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,890
我们接管了圣玛丽娜岛上的
we have commandeered the N.A.T.O.

12
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,340
北约预警监测站
early warning station on the island of Sainte Marina.

13
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,960
这个监测站和外面停靠的那艘潜艇
This station, and that sub parked outside--

14
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,270
现在起都归我管
they all belong to me now.

15
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,270
另有20余艘战舰正在逼近
We're reading some 20 other warships closing in

16
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,630
200英里无人区边界
on the 200 mile line.

17
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,570
大部分将于48小时内到达
Most should arrive within the next 48 hours.

18
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,030
谢帕德上将  你我心知肚明  
Admiral Shepard, we both know

19
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,400
潜艇根本不是巴基斯坦人击沉的
the Pakistanis didn't sink her.

20
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,000
-爸  是我  -我以为你死了
- Dad, it's me. - I thought I'd lost you.

21
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,370
你们到底干了些什么
What the hell did you just do?

22
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:34,680
塔妮  你以为我是为和平而战吗
You think I made the peace, Tani?

23
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,010
我只不过是好久没杀人了
I just ran out of people to kill.

24
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,170
这是我的岛
This is my island.

25
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,490
想让我同意你们留下
If I allow your presence,

26
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,120
可是有条件的
it comes with certain terms and conditions.

27
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,340
科泰兹和布兰伦仍未归队
Cortez and Brannan are still missing and assumed awol.

28
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,250
科泰兹是第三次出海了  她不会擅离职守
Cortez is third tour. She's not awol.

29
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,270
我们得开始搜寻他们了
We gotta start looking for 'em.

30
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,460
马库斯  告诉他们
Marcus, tell them

31
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,580
你的儿子两周前在阿富汗
that your son got killed by friendly fire

32
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,350
被友军误杀
two weeks ago in Afghanistan.

33
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,070
因为最深的痛楚  正是激励我们的力量
What hurts us the most-- that's our strength.

34
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,730
正是支撑我们抗争到底的勇气
That's what gets us through.

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,790
退后
Back away!

36
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,570
说你呢  放手  退后  都退后
Hey, got off! Back away! Back away!

37
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:12,880
-他偷我们东西  -什么
- He stole from us! - What?!

38
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,770
就是他  他偷我们东西  
Right there-- he stole from us!

39
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:14,910
谁偷你东西  帕克
Who stole from you? Parker!

40
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,580
-就是根破香蕉罢了  -你居然偷他们东西
- It was a banana, for god sake! - You stole from these people?!

41
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,040
-就是根香蕉  -马上给他一美元
- It was a banana. - Give him a dollar right now.

42
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,260
下不为例  听明白了吗
This will not happen again! Do you understand me?

43
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,040
我饿了  我想要香蕉我就拿
I'm hungry! If I want a banana, I'll take it!

44
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,040
关你4个小时禁闭给我好好反省
What you'll take is two rotations of E.M.I.

45
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,750
去潜艇上报道  剩下的人
Report to the boat. The rest of you

46
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,130
继续寻找失踪的人
continue searching for our missing people!

47
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,200
我们根本就不应该在这
We shouldn't even be here!

48
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,820
去潜艇上报道  这是命令  必须服从
Report to the boat. I gave you an order. Follow it.

49
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,060
那把我关禁闭吧  没了我们他们就撑不下去了
So throw me in the brig. They can't do this without us.

50
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,290
问问水手长  没有我们他们就得投降
Ask the C.O.B. without us, they have to surrender,

51
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,780
我们就能回家了
and we all go home.

52
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:40,670
给
Here.

53
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,840
军装给你  拿好
Here's your uniform. Take it.

54
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,680
是要给我们跳钢管舞吗  帕克
You gonna give us a pole dance now, Parker?

55
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,610
不错
Very nice.

56
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,870
把他关禁闭
Put him in the brig.

57
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,550
霍夫曼  把他关禁闭
Hoffman, put him in the brig.

58
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,650
立刻
Right now.

59
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,990
别碰我
Get off me!

60
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,040
怎么着
What?

61
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,410
最后一次有人看见雷德曼是昨天中午
Last anyone saw Redman was mid-rats yesterday.

62
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,260
整个岛都搜遍了
And we've scoured the island--

63
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,670
依然没有科泰兹和布兰伦的踪影
Still no sign of Cortez or Brannan, either.

64
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,470
这不像是擅离职守
This doesn't feel like an AWOL. situation.

65
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,800
本来就不是
That's because it's not.

66
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,170
我是科罗拉多号的马库斯艇长
This is Captain Marcus Chaplin of the U.S.S. Colorado.

67
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,590
我在跟谁对话
To whom am I speaking?

68
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,840
白宫高级顾问阿曼达・斯昭
White House Senior Adviser Amanda Straugh.

69
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,530
我被任命为对你们的谈判专员
I've been named as your negotiator.

70
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,170
祝贺你  斯昭女士  
Congratulations, Miss Straugh.

71
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,400
我很钦佩你在科索沃的作为
I admired your work in Kosovo.

72
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,270
查普林先生  傍晚你们就将被完全封锁
Mr. Chaplin, the blockade is set to close by nightfall.

73
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,520
我想你对随之而来的后果心知肚明
I think you understand the ramifications of this,

74
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,170
你的艇员也应该清楚
as does your crew.

75
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,140
除非无条件投降
Unless you surrender unconditionally,

76
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,690
否则你们将失去与外界的一切联系
you will be effectively cut off from the world.

77
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,230
你上司打算杀了我艇上的所有人
Your boss tried to kill every man and woman on my boat,

78
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,200
现在你又要求我无条件投降
and now you expect unconditional surrender.

79
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,420
有点过分了吧
That's a bit of a reach, isn't it,

80
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,310
想想仍在我手上的17枚三叉戟核弹
considering the 17 tridents still in my control?

81
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,520
想想你儿子杰弗里
Think of your son Jeffrey.

82
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,290
我儿子已经死了
My son is dead.

83
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,010
海军希望能给他举办正式的葬礼
And the marines hoped to give him a proper funeral.

84
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,510
查普林先生  你一日不降
Mr. Chaplin, there will be no burial for your son

85
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,810
你儿子就一日不会有葬礼
until you surrender.

86
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,640
他的尸体将无限期地
His remains will rest in a Navy morgue

87
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,270
停放在海军停尸房
until that time-- indefinitely.

88
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,560
为了你的艇员  为了你的儿子
For your crew, for your son,

89
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,150
请做出正确的决定
do what's right.

90
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,080
副艇长  有什么事吗
What's on your mind, X.O.?

91
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,580
我们的艇员出了点问题
We got a problem with the crew.

92
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,240
别告诉我你俩也被关起来了
Don't tell me you're both under arrest, too.

93
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,340
地方有点不够用了  
We're getting full up here.

94
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,660
听说布兰伦和科泰兹的事了吧
Heard about Brannan and Cortez?

95
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,750
还有雷德曼
And Redman.

96
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,680
都失踪了
All missing.

97
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,120
艇员们以为他们擅离职守了
Crew thinks they're AWOL.

98
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,150
他们不是擅离职守
They're not AWOL.

99
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,230
我们终于有意见一致的时候了  小子
For once, you and me agree, junior.

100
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,430
你想加入寻找他们的队伍吗
You want to be a part of the effort to find them?

101
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,780
你以为我不知道出了什么事吗
You don't think I know what's going on?

102
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,480
你正渐渐失势
You're losing control.

103
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,090
我在这儿关着更有影响力
I'm more powerful in here than out.

104
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,130
没错  这笼子成了你的造反司令部了
Yeah, I see you've found yourself a bully pulpit.

105
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,860
这岛也成了你威胁祖国
And you found a way to spite your country

106
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,550
以泄丧子之愤的泄愤之地
for Jeffrey's death.

107
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,350
你我愿望相同  送我上军事法庭
You and I want the same thing-- me in front of a court-martial,

108
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,300
在那里我们之中一人将被证明是正确的
where one of us will be proven right.

109
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,930
你可以就这么作壁上观
Meanwhile, here you sit, watching,

110
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,330
不顾手下三名士兵失踪
while three of your own go missing

111
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,580
其余人也渐渐军心涣散
and your men slowly start to unravel.

112
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,610
我从未想到你会把艇员放在第二位
I never thought I'd see you put anything

113
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,210
乔  尤其是放在首位的竟是你的自尊
ahead of your people, Joe-- least of all, pride.

114
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,770
向我保证  如果我释放你
So give me your word that if I release you,

115
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,200
你不会从中作梗
you will not undermine me,

116
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,130
绝不暗中迫害我的人和破坏我的潜艇
you will not sabotage my people or my boat.

117
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,040
你要助我回国上军事法庭
You will help me get back home to a court-martial,

118
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,730
到时候你就是控方的关键证人
where you can be the star witness for the prosecution.

119
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,620
你还相信我的话吗
My word still good enough for you?

120
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:35,640
相信
Yes.

121
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:44,720
那我想你保证
You have my word.

122
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,060
给水手长开锁
Unlock the C.O.B.!

123
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,880
我可不信
It ain't good enough for me.

124
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,880
我会盯着你的  水手长
I'll be watching you, C.O.B.

125
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,850
穿好上衣  帕克
Get your blouse on, Parker.

126
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,600
今天可不是便装星期五
It's not casual Friday around here.

127
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,890
遵命  长官
Sir.

128
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,340
你到底去不去
Are you coming or not?

129
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,240
离晚饭还六个小时呢
Dinner's in six hours.

130
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,390
你以为有公交坐吗  我们得赶快
You think there's a bus? We have to hurry.

131
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,330
酒吧打烊了  大家起身吧
Bar's closed, you guys. Raise.

132
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,640
一百块
A hundred.

133
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,620
你从哪儿弄到的
Where'd you get this?

134
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,980
别说我没帮过你们
Don't say I never did anything for you.

135
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,030
这是科泰兹的
This belongs to Cortez.

136
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,850
对  从一个为塞拉特卖命的家伙手里得来的
Yeah. Got it from a guy who works for a guy named Serrat.

137
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,780
法国妞的朋友
Friend of the French lady.

138
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,150
你不来信  也不打电话
You didn't write, you didn't call.

139
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,370
你也没用鞋带上吊
You didn't hang yourself with your shoelaces.

140
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,470
我们都让彼此失望了
We all have our disappointments to muster.

141
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,150
你挡住我的路了  水手长
You're blocking my way, C.O.B.

142
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,160
是吗
Am I?

143
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,160
走开
Stop.

144
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,570
多谢赏光共舞  长官
Thanks for the dance, ma'am.

145
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,740
我不认为朱利安・塞拉特有朋友
I don't think Julian Serrat has friends.

146
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,570
小心  玛丽亚  太重你拿不动

147
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,900
我们只是想知道对手是谁
Look, we just want to know who we're dealing with here.

148
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,800
她说不知道  你该走了
She said no. It's time for you to leave now.

149
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,490
听着  现在我们的人
Listen. Right now my people

150
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,190
不知道被谁囚禁在什么地方
are being held in some room somewhere.

151
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,490
不知道等待他们的会是什么
They have no say in anything that's happening to them.

152
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,850
他们很害怕  只想回家
They are scared. They just want to go home.

153
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,740
我想保证他们能回家
I want to see that they do.

154
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,340
我会跟朱利安谈  跟你们艇长一起
I'll talk to Julian. With your captain.

155
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,200
-就你们两个  -是的
- Just you and my captain? - Yes.

156
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,890
不能带别人  必须这样
No one else. That's how it must be.

157
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,140
我不能保证你的安全
I can't promise you'll be safe.

158
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,920
你需要担心的不是我
I'm not the one you have to worry about.

159
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,460
他...  怎么说来着
He's... how do you put it?

160
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,470
他对我非常好
He's sweet on me.

161
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,320
我要去

162
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,850
索菲  我们得在军舰合围之前离开这里

163
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,740
今晚之前来得及

164
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,840
他是在利用你

165
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,190
没人能利用我

166
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,110
我们六点海滩见

167
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:11,080
如果你六点没到  我不会等的
If you're not here by 6:00, I won't wait for you.

168
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,660
你们艇长是个什么样的人
What kind of man is your captain?

169
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:38,310
他要么愚蠢要么无礼  要么二者兼备
He's either a stupid man or a very disrespectful man or both.

170
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,380
他怎么不来见我  还要我抓多少人
Why won't he come to me? How many must I take?

171
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,870
十个  二十个
10? 20?

172
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,580
你们知道答案吗
Can you figure it out?

173
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,340
你叫什么名字
What is your name?

174
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:48,820
瑞德
Red.

175
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,840
瑞德
Red.

176
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,800
这岛上的每一个人都知道
Everyone on this island knows--

177
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,980
遇到麻烦  就来找朱利安・塞拉特
If you have a problem, you come to Julian Serrat.

178
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,770
比方说  就在今天
For instance, just today

179
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:01,400
他们带来一个男孩  才15岁
a boy was brought to me, only 15--

180
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,570
颈部中弹
shot in the neck.

181
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,590
死在你们交火的那片丛林里
He died in the jungle during a battle your people were in.

182
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:08,790
我们不朝孩子开枪
We don't shoot kids.

183
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,390
可他还是中弹了
Nevertheless, he was shot.

184
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,450
必须有人付出代价
Someone has to pay now.

185
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,560
等一下
Hey! Listen.

186
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:23,130
我能跟你谈谈吗  私下
Can I talk to you? Privately?

187
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,470
我会让你不虚此行的
I'll make it worth your while.

188
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:41,040
巴基斯坦制造了数个便携式核装置
Pakistan had developed several portable nuclear devices.

189
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,860
国防部副部长科利主张打击巴基斯坦
核打击是唯一选择

190
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,920
我方情报已确认
Our intelligence determined...

191
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,790
巴基斯坦政府工作人员
that Pakistani government operatives

192
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,580
已将这些装置交给了恐怖分子
had placed those devices in the hands of terrorists,

193
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,200
并且即将用于恐怖活动
and that they were about to be taken.

194
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,050
出什么事了
What's going on?

195
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,610
先发制人的核战争成了我们的新政策
Proactive nuclear war is our new official policy.

196
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:53,930
就是这事
That's what's happening.

197
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:54,870
遥控器呢
Where's the remote?

198
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,920
-声音放小点  -喂
- Turn it down! - Hello?

199
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,700
十分果决
... and decisively.

200
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,460
核打击回应是保证美国安全的唯一手段
A nuclear response was the only one that guaranteed American safe--

201
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:04,110
是的  我在看  太可怕了
Yes. I'm watching. It's terrifying.

202
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,610
为什么
Why?

203
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,350
是的  我知道
Yes. I know it.

204
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,380
好的
Okay.

205
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,020
我得去见一个人
I have to meet someone.

206
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,400
现在吗
Now?

207
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,240
你这么担心这块硬盘
If you're so worried about that hard drive,

208
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,080
不如放进银行保险箱
you should put it in a safe deposit box.

209
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,200
罗伯特  这里面有科罗拉多号样机的所有技术
Robert, all of the tech for the prototype on the "Colorado" is on here.

210
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,790
唯一一份原理图
The only schematic.

211
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,470
你觉得我会把它托付给银行吗
You think I'd entrust that to a bank?

212
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,340
你疑心病太重
That is completely paranoid.

213
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,060
我知道
I know.

214
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,770
别让任何人进来
Don't let anyone in.

215
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,530
我可不会等你回来
I'm not waiting up for you.

216
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:39,630
不  你会的
Sure, you will.

217
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,890
谢帕德上将
Admiral Shepard?

218
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,290
有人吗
Knock, knock.

219
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,690
马库斯・查普林宣称  科罗拉多号收到的
Marcus Chaplin claims that the nuke order

220
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:55,100
核弹发射命令来自南极紧急通讯网
sent to the "Colorado" came through the antarctic network,

221
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,340
而非主通讯网
not the main network.

222
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,960
这不可能  因为我们并未遭受攻击
Which is impossible, because we weren't under attack.

223
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,830
而且有谁会相信一个好战的疯子呢
And who believes a trigger-happy madman anyway?

224
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,740
至少你相信  所以你来了
Well, you do. That's why you came.

225
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,270
我需要知道命令是谁下的
I need to know who sent that order.

226
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,020
让我去问问海军情报部的朋友莱纳斯吧
Let me just ask my friend Linus in Naval Intelligence.

227
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,900
哦  不对  他还在医院昏迷着呢
Oh, wait. He's lying comatose in a hospital

228
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,730
因为他对贝类过敏
because of a shellfish allergy.

229
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,050
顺便说一句  我对什么都不过敏
I'm allergic to nothing, by the way,

230
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,480
所以我若也遭受不测  拜托你露个面好吗
so if that happens, throw a flag on the play, will you?

231
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,270
你的朋友莱纳斯是个无名小卒  你可不是
Your friend Linus was nobody, but you're not.

232
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,270
你老爸和总统一起打高尔夫球
Your father golfs with the president,

233
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,300
而且我好像读到过  在华府
and I read somewhere where you're one of D.C.'s

234
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,170
你是最受欢迎的单身女性之一
most eligible bachelorettes.

235
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:25,340
是吗  不小心被发现了
Hmm. Well, look where that's got me.

236
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,530
在这件事中  你有得天独厚的条件
You're uniquely qualified to do something about this.

237
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:30,110
得天独厚的条件  就是拿我自己的人头冒险
Uniquely qualified to risk my own ass

238
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,010
去救你的宝贝女儿是吧
to help you save your daughter?

239
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,370
你以为我是谁啊
Who do you think I am?

240
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,780
你是战争中的寄生虫
You're a parasite who traffics in war

241
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,630
从来不用承担任何风险
without ever getting her hands dirty,

242
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,740
而这个国家付钱购买你们家族的武器
and this country has made you rich

243
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,560
让你赚得盆满钵满
buying your family's weapons.

244
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,810
你不该做出点回报吗
Aren't you ready to do something in return?

245
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,920
这是那条命令的文件号
It's the file number of the order.

246
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,510
这样够爱国了吧
Patriotic enough for you?

247
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,840
你还是在乎的  这个能帮上我
You do care. This will help me.

248
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,340
也能帮上其他和我一样相信此事的人
And it will help the people that believe as I do.

249
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,680
但你依然需要出面提出一些我不能提的问题
But you still need to ask the questions that I can't.

250
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,090
闹出些动静吧  辛克莱小姐
Make some noise, Miss Sinclair.

251
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,160
你跟他说什么了
What did you say to him?

252
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,370
不是她说了什么
It's not what she said.

253
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,460
而是她做了什么
It's what she did.

254
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,990
谢谢你  科泰兹
Thank you, Cortez.

255
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,870
[土语]

256
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,680
朱利安
Julian.

257
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,660
这位是马库斯・查普林艇长
This is Captain Marcus Chaplin.

258
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,390
他的几名手下失踪了
He's lost a few of his men,

259
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,500
我告诉他你能帮上忙
and I told him you could help.

260
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,490
欢迎
Welcome.

261
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,280
我还想艇长大人什么时候才会
I was wondering when I could expect a visit

262
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,670
大驾光临呢
from the great Captain.

263
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,230
您和您的潜艇给我们这个小小的世外桃源
You and your submarine have caused a commotion

264
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,560
闹得有点鸡犬不宁啊
in our little paradise.

265
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,860
我们很庆幸能在这里找到一个港湾
We're grateful to find a harbor here.

266
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,000
我们很愿意招待你们短暂停留
We are glad to temporarily accommodate you.

267
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,540
我艇上的三名艇员失踪了
I'm missing three crew members.

268
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,160
那你怎么不早来找我
You should have come to me sooner!

269
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,280
不过你现在来了  这才是最重要的
But you are here now. That is what is important.

270
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,860
-我想我是找对人了  -没错
- I see I've come to the right man. - Yes, you have.

271
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,310
我就是你该找的人
I'm the right man.

272
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,030
那边那些人
Those people there--

273
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,830
由于你们的到来  他们的儿子被杀了
Their son was killed because of your interference here.

274
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,850
你们为这个岛带来了暴力
You brought violence to this island.

275
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,450
现在那孩子死去了  这个女人沉浸在悲痛中  
Now this child is dead, and this woman is in mourning.

276
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,100
我们也是
As are we all.

277
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,150
我要包办他们儿子葬礼的费用
I'm paying for their son's funeral.

278
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,070
我知道我们的到来给这里带来了不少麻烦
I understand our presence here has been a burden,

279
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,130
但我们之间不需要再起争端
but there's no need for us to quarrel,

280
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:58,660
因为如果真的要争  你输定了
because if we do, you'll lose.

281
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,800
被千刀万剐
A death by a thousand cuts.

282
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,850
这就是和我斗的下场
That would be war with me.

283
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,090
[土语]

284
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,970
这座岛处于封锁中
A blockade surrounds this island.

285
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,630
我有一艘满载贵重货物的船
I have a boat with very valuable cargo.

286
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,100
现在我满脑子想的都是这艘船
And I'm so concerned about this boat,

287
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,300
根本没工夫考虑你失踪的手下
I can't think about your missing crewmen.

288
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:30,720
我们有办法拿到你想要的东西
We have the means to get what you want

289
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,410
如果你有办法找到我的手下
if you have the means to return my crewmen.

290
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,860
好吧
Okay.

291
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,360
今晚他们会为死者守夜
They will stay with the body all night.

292
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,460
明天一早  我们会准备把男孩下葬
At dawn, we will prepare the boy for burial.

293
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,190
你欠这些人的债  我帮你还了
You have a debt to these people that I have paid.

294
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,840
但在天亮之前  你要还上欠我的债
But before dawn, you must bring me what you owe me.

295
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,010
你给的时间太短
That's not much time.

296
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,280
是的  我知道
Yes, I know.

297
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,280
你要是早点来就好了
I wish you had come to me sooner.

298
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,450
塞拉特给你的时间很少
Serrat didn't give you much time.

299
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,920
你们能办到吗
Will you be able to do it?

300
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,260
我们别无选择
We have to.

301
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,580
祝你好运
Good luck with everything.

302
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,420
再见
Uh, good-bye.

303
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,490
再见
Good-bye.

304
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:36,980
我醒着呢
I'm awake.

305
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,380
我们快到了
We're almost there.

306
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,100
你没告诉我要走这么久
You didn't tell me it'd take this long.

307
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,880
我又不知道你这么娇气
I had no idea you were so fragile.

308
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,200
真不敢相信你住在这里
I can't believe this is where you live.

309
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,710
我妈妈以前经常来这儿
My mother came here a lot.

310
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,610
是吗  她也像你这么难缠吗
Yeah? Is she as much of a ball-buster as you?

311
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,770
不再是了  她去世了
Not anymore. She died.

312
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,420
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

313
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:58,650
我也是
Me, too.

314
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,870
你的父母呢  他们还健在吗
What about your parents? Are they still alive?

315
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:01,790
对
Yep.

316
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,010
就一个 对  字
That's it? Just "Yep"?

317
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,520
对
Yep.

318
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,290
艇员们状态不错
Crew looks good.

319
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,470
他们都明白形势
They know what's at stake.

320
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,420
我可不喜欢给毒枭当中间人
Can't say I like the idea of being a bagman for a drug lord.

321
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,930
而我不想两面受敌
And I don't like the idea of a war on two fronts.

322
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,350
我好像没有允许过你随便说话  水手长
I don't recall giving you permission to speak freely, C.O.B.

323
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,930
抱歉  长官  我犯糊涂了
Sorry, sir. I'm a little rusty.

324
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,180
全体艇员  我是副艇长
Crew, this is the X.O.

325
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,480
我们都清楚接下来要干什么
We all know what we're about to do,

326
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,710
原因也心知肚明
and we know why we're doing it.

327
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,370
布兰伦  科泰兹和瑞德曼都在指望着我们
Brannan, Cortez, and Redman are all counting on us.

328
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,740
为救战友而战  副艇长讲话完毕
Let's go get our people back. X.O. Out.

329
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,630
长官  潜艇正在接近封锁区内的战舰
You're approaching the ships in the blockade, sir.

330
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,420
工程舱  准备好珀尔修斯样机
Engineering, ready the Perseus prototype.

331
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,990
副艇长  启动需要时间
X.O., it'll take a moment to power up.

332
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:05,220
珀尔修斯启动程序

333
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,010
启动珀尔修斯系统

334
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,730
珀尔修斯准备完毕

335
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:18,620
美海军科罗拉多号

336
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,260
长官  潜艇消失了  屏幕上信号消失
You're gone, sir. Screens are clear.

337
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,050
科罗拉多号已隐身
The "Colorado's" Disappeared.

338
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,140
舵手  航向060  全速前进
Helm, 0-6-0, ahead full.

339
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,950
凯姆伦  开始计时  还有九小时天亮
Cameron, set a clock. We have nine hours to sunrise.

340
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,020
我需要你帮个忙
Hey. I need a favor.

341
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,380
让你的参议员调出
I need your senator to requisition

342
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,490
998命令的时间戳
a time stamp on order 998.

343
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,490
时间戳  经过加密而形成的凭证文档

344
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,850
此命令由南极通讯网下达给科罗拉多号
Came through the antarctic network to the "Colorado."

345
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,770
你是说查普林在电视上提到的那个
You mean the thing Chaplin talked about on TV?

346
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,390
那个通讯网是冷战遗物  只有在华府
It's a cold war relic. It's only supposed to be used

347
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,350
遭到核弹攻击才会加以使用
if someone hit D.C. with the big one.

348
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,200
拜托了
Please?

349
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:57,580
拜托啦  拜托嘛
Please, please, please?

350
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,840
我  我试试吧
I-I'll, uh... I'll work on it.

351
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,880
谢谢
Thank you.

352
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,180
不过  罗伯特  记着让参议员动手
Hey, Robert, make sure it goes through the senator.

353
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,110
别自己去
Don't do it yourself.

354
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,660
正在接近封锁线  长官
Approaching the blockade, sir.

355
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,390
艇长  发现两艘驱逐舰
Captain, I hold 2 destroyers.

356
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,770
两侧各5000码处
5,000 yards on each side.

357
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,850
计划航线

00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,850
科罗拉多号

359
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:29,550
副艇长  我们得从中间穿过去
X.O., we're gonna have to pass in between them.

360
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,280
珀尔修斯系统已停止工作
Perseus is offline.

361
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,880
长官  声纳可以探测到你的潜艇
Sir, I have a sonar location on you.

362
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,580
他们听得到你们
They can hear you.

363
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:35,570
美海军科罗拉多号

364
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,550
重复  隐身已失效

00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,880
工程舱  马上重启珀尔修斯系统
Engineering, conn. Get the Perseus back online now.

366
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:39,970
是  长官
Aye, sir.

367
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,880
珀尔修斯系统停止运行

368
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,110
指挥台  这里是工程舱

369
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,060
珀尔修斯系统已恢复  长官
All systems back online, sir.

370
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,660
潜艇再次隐身
You're off the screens again.

371
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,690
驱逐舰有什么动静吗
Any movement on the destroyers?

372
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:53,960
原位不动
Holding position.

373
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,300
看来我们很幸运
Looks like we got lucky.

374
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,720
舵手  超速前进
Helm, ahead flank.

375
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,250
潜水官  调整至深度600英尺
Diving officer, make your depth 600 feet.

376
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,780
任务按原计划继续
Proceed with the mission.

377
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,330
把货物运进来
Let's get that cargo on board.

378
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,040
小心点  给你
Watch yourself. Here you go.

379
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:19,820
货物按计划装载完毕
Cargo on board right on schedule.

380
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,610
船员下舱完毕  舱口安全
Last man down. Hatch secured.

381
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,230
把这些锁进供给箱  别打开
Lock them up in supply. Don't open them.

382
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,890
是  副艇长  里面是什么
Aye, X.O. What's in 'em?

383
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,130
三条人命
Three lives.

384
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,430
你就这样离开了文明社会  没回过头
So you just left civilization and never looked back?

385
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,400
对
Yeah.

386
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,630
一开始我以为这里只是我的遗产
At first I thought this place was just my heritage,

387
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,450
没想到竟然是我的救星
but it turned out to be my salvation.

388
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,380
别人都没有他幸运
Others of us weren't so lucky.

389
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,670
很多人没有这样的勇气
Most people don't have the courage to do that.

390
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,610
他们只是口头说说  过脱离世界的生活  
They talk about it-- just live off the grid

391
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:52,910
或是重新开始什么的
or have a clean start or whatever.

392
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,130
而你是身体力行了
You actually did it.

393
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,420
-下周艾图就成年了  -是啊
- And next week, Aitu becomes a man. - Right.

394
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,020
还要  还要举行个仪式
There's a-- there's this ritual.

395
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,810
很赞  之后我就可以当学徒了
It's awesome. And after that, I can apprentice.

396
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:04,710
什么
What?

397
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,470
马努同意指导他了
Manu agreed to take him on.

398
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,430
我们之前不是这么定的
That wasn't the plan.

399
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:12,090
-以后再说  -不  现在说
- We'll talk about it later. - No, we'll talk about it now!

400
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,140
你跟他说了什么
What did you say to him?

401
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,470
他应该好好过日子
He deserves to have a life.

402
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,370
-这样挺好的  -你懂什么
- I like my life. - You don't know the difference!

403
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:18,630
塔妮  他改变主意了
Tani, he changed his mind.

404
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,840
不  是你逼他的
No, you changed his mind!

405
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,210
你就是不罢休  是吧
You won't stop, will you?

406
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:28,490
你还要毁掉这个家里  多少人的生活
How many lives in this family do you plan on ruining?

407
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,720
我女儿发脾气和太阳升起一样正常
My daughter storms off, the sun comes up.

408
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,480
预料之中的  不用追
It's expected. Stay.

409
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,760
谢谢你的招待
Thank you for your hospitality,

410
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,690
但是我得去陪带我来的伙伴
but I'm gonna dance with the one that brung me.

411
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,710
晚安  先生
Good night, sir.

412
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,800
警告

413
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,800
主动力系统失稳

414
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,800
辅助动力启动

415
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,800
辅助动力启动

416
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,280
工程舱  这里是指挥台
Engineering, conn.

417
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,470
珀尔修斯系统停了我的电
The Perseus is draining my power.

418
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,720
长官  它正在烧毁电路
Sir, it's starting to burn through circuits.

419
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,550
如果现在不关掉它
We don't shut it down,

420
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,260
我们有断电风险

421
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,890
给老子关了这破玩意

Prosser, keep a lid on it. Keep a lid on it.

先生们  内部矛盾先放一边
Gentlemen, stow this problem,

434
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,810
不然我们在一分钟后就会玩完

447

他们一定警告了封锁舰队

艇长  你这是要破纪录吗
You going for the record, captain?

456

多艘舰船  行驶方向相同
Multiple, on the same heading.

473
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,680
是三艘驱逐舰  不  是四艘

483
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,760
目标正在穿过
Contact's passing.

484
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,130
这是个典型的3深弹反潜程序

485

That's a wall, sir. Right up to the surface.

494
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:19,130
不  那是一个峡谷  他们不敢追到那
No, it's a canyon. They'd be crazy to come after us.

495
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,050
你对间隙距离有把握吗
You sure about the clearance?

496
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,650
即使我们能驶入  也不能永远藏在里面
Even if we fit, we can't hide in there forever.

497
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,780
我们不用躲  我们要穿过峡谷
We're not gonna hide. We're going through.

498
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:35,750
长官  他们已经搜索到并锁定了我们
Sir, they have us acquired and ranged.

也许吧
Maybe.

505
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,650
抱歉你父亲没对我大发雷霆
Sorry your dad didn't hate me more.

506
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:14,630
计划就是这样  对吗
That was the idea, right?

507
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:15,630
把入侵者带去吃晚饭
Bring the invader to dinner?

508
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,220
是啊
Yes...

509
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,010
计划就是这样
That was the idea.

510
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,560
我高中时  姑娘都会带我回家
You know, in high school I was the go-to guy

511
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,920
去气她们的父亲
for girls looking to piss off their fathers.

512
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:26,730
-他看上去没那么坏  -闭嘴
- He doesn't seem that bad. - Oh, shut up.

513
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,090
我只想说  不知道你想让你弟弟如何生活
I'm just saying, I don't know what you worked out

514
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,740
但他看上去在这里过得很开心
with your brother, but he seems pretty happy here.

515
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,170
这不管你的事
You know, it's really none of your business.

516
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,350
是啊  该我管的事远在九千英里之外
No. My business is about 9,000 miles away.

517
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,590
这是什么地方
So what is this place?

518
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,320
她被葬在这儿
She's buried here.

519
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,090
我给她带了一些姜糖
I brought her some ginger candy.

520
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,990
这是种  怎么说
It's kind of... I don't know,

521
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,960
一种问候她的方式吧
A way of saying hi, I guess.

522
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,200
我的父亲  他不是个好人
You know, he's not a good man, my father.

523
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,230
当我母亲生病时  他说服她
When my mother got sick, he convinced her

524
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,030
应该在岛上治疗
she should be treated here.

525
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,130
你懂的
You know.

526
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:06,740
用传统草药和那些荒谬的方法
Traditional medicine and all that nonsense.

527
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:11,020
却不愿把她带回澳大利亚
Didn't want to take her back to Australia...

528
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,230
她便同意了
So she went along.

529
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,870
她总是对他让步
Always appeasing him.

530
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,650
临死前  她非常痛苦
She was in a lot of pain at the end.

531
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:34,670
我等着艾图长大
I was waiting for Aitu to be old enough

532
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:38,260
把他带离这里
to get him away from here.

533
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:41,300
听着  塔妮
Look... Tani,

534
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:44,370
他留下并不等于你也必须留下
Just 'cause he's staying doesn't mean you have to.

535
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,680
你好  罗伯特
Hello, Robert.

536
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,210
知道我是谁吗
Do you know who I am?

537
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:17,680
-当然知道  -很好
- Y-yes, of course. - Well, good.

538
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:19,740
那就省事了
Then this won't take long.

539
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,310
罗伯特
Robert?

540
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,800
罗伯特  你在吗
Robert, are you here?

541
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,480
为什么女孩们总喜欢带你回家
Why were you the one the girls would bring home?

542
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,660
估计她们都以为能改变我
I guess they thought they could fix me.

543
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:14,180
她们成功了吗
Did they?

544
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,890
只有一个差点成功了
Only one came close.

545
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:18,230
-她叫什么名字  -美国海军
- What was her name? - U.S. Navy.

546
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,410
但我们正在经历一段困难时期
But we're going through a bit of a rough patch at the moment.

547
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:21,720
她让你认识了整个世界
She showed you the world.

548
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,410
一个并不那么美好的世界
World ain't all it's cracked up to be.

549
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,570
你听到那声音了吗
Do you hear that?

550
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,240
那是艾图将举行成人仪式的地方
That's where Aitu will come for his ritual.

551
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,500
他需要做什么
What does he have to do?

552
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:01,100
祝贺你  你是个男人了
Congratulations. You're a man.

553
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,770
是吗  那你跳下来算怎样
Yeah? What does that make you, then?

554
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,540
妈妈曾带我来过这里
My mom used to bring me here.

555
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,870
这是我们的小秘密
It was our little secret.

556
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,920
本来只有男孩能来
It's only supposed to be for the boys...

557
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,710
就像这里很多事情一样
like most things around here.

558
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,290
这地方就是这样
That's the thing about this place.

559
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:25,800
美好的事情却总是那么短暂
The best things never last for long.

560
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:31,340
我们得走了  回去要走很长的路
We should go. It's a long walk back.

561
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:37,740
情况汇报  水手长
Sit-rep, Master Chief?

562
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,280
样机烧坏了右舷配电板
Prototype fried the starboard switchboards.

563
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,080
反应堆供能为三分之一
Reactor's at one-third.

564
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,540
各主系统功能正由辅助系统运行
Vital systems are on auxiliary.

565
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,290
系统导航是没指望了
And you can forget about any nav.

566
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:47,680
我们在尽力重新启动  但是
We're trying to reboot, but...

567
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:50,580
山姆  尝试呼叫格蕾丝  让她帮我们定位
Sam, if you can raise Grace, get our position.

568
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:52,300
如果打不通的话
If we can't get through,

569
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,580
就只能干等着了
we're gonna have to wait this one out.

570
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,750
谢帕德上尉  谢帕德上尉  请回话
Lieutenant Shepard, Lieutenant Shepard, come in.

571
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,690
-我在  副艇长  -能够定位我们吗
- I'm here, X.O. - Can you get a fix on us?

572
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,380
并不准确  长官  干扰信号太多
Not accurately, sir. There's too much interference.

573
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:02,290
我们失去导航能力了  谢帕德上尉
We're blind down here, Lieutenant Shepard.

574
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,610
谢帕德上尉  还在吗  完毕
Lieutenant Shepard, are you there? Over.

575
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:10,930
失去联系了
We lost her.

576
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,680
山姆  我是索菲  我知道你们在哪
Sam, it's Sophie. I know where you are.

577
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,070
我有那个区域的海图
Uh, I've got that area charted.

578
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,030
那是什么
What is that?

579
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,010
你只需要知道怎么看图
You just need to know how to read it.

580
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:24,410
我想我能把你们带出去  听仔细
I think I can get you out. Listen carefully.

581
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:26,730
-深度多少  -175英尺
- What's your depth? - 175 feet.

582
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:28,290
-速度  -9节
- Speed? - 9 knots.

583
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:30,170
主动声呐能否正常使用
Do you still have active sonar?

584
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,640
可以  但会非常危险
Yeah, we do, but it's very dangerous.

585
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,200
我知道  但还是得用一下
I know, but do it anyway.

586
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,090
凯姆伦  启用一次回声测深仪
Cameron, one ping on the fathometer.

587
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:51,540
下潜50英尺
Down 50.

588
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:53,960
-潜至225英尺  -是  长官
- Dive to 225. - Yes, sir.

589
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,200
好的
Okay.

590
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,790
目前深度225英尺
We're at 225.

591
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,480
-速度  -10节
- Speed? - 10 knots.

592
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,950
很快将转弯  我会告诉你
You'll turn soon. I'll tell you.

593
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:05,860
转向那边
Which side?

594
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,290
右舷  快了
Starboard. Soon.

595
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:08,310
好的
Okay.

596
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:12,030
我觉得  可以开始缓慢转舵了
I think... you may scrape.

597
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:14,390
-哪边  右舷吗  -是的
- Which side? Starboard side? - Yes.

598
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,900
开始计时  现在就转舵
Mark. Turn now--

599
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,300
-十度  -向右舵十度
- 10 degrees. - Turn 10 degrees starboard side.

600
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,650
没错  就是这个动静
Yeah, that's what that sounds like.

601
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,520
很快就到了
Almost there.

602
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,740
潜至300英尺
Dive to 300 feet.

603
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:39,430
有只小船离开岛屿了
There's a small craft leaving the island.

604
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,910
没关系  我知道是谁
It's okay. I know who it is.

605
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,140
好的  当前深度300英尺
Okay, we're at-- we're at 300 feet.

606
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,320
水平航行  保持深度90米
Level off. Stay at 90 meters.

607
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,820
我是说  英尺
I mean, uh, feet.

608
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,370
300英尺  抱歉
Uh, 300 feet, sorry.

609
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,850
没关系  没问题
No, that's okay. That's fine.

610
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:00,920
用声呐再探测一次
Another ping.

611
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,540
再来一次  你说过"就一次"
Another ping? You said "once."

612
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,880
我从没说过"就一次"
I never said "once."

613
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:13,170
向左转20度
Turn port 20 degrees.

614
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:14,550
空间非常有限
Okay, there's not much room.

615
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,430
这艘潜艇转弯半径不够小
Yeah, this sub doesn't really corner all that well.

616
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,900
那我们就得小心点
Then we'll have to be careful.

617
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:19,990
好的
Okay.

618
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,170
差不多快到了
You're almost there.

619
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,280
升至120英尺
Rise to 120 feet.

620
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:35,850
然后就可以了  只需等待
And nothing else. Just, uh... waiting.

621
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,040
没关系  我等惯了
That's okay. I'm used to it.

622
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,580
我也是
Me, too.

623
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:57,720
我们安全了
We're clear.

624
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,870
成功抵达另一边
We're on the other side.

625
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,630
-好了  上浮吧  -是  长官
- All right, bring us up. - Aye, sir.

626
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,170
舵手  超速前进
Helm, all ahead flank.

627
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:11,410
航向191度  驶回海滩
Make your course 1-9-1. We're headed back to the beach.

628
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:12,270
是  长官
Yes, sir.

629
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:43,930
你们艇长违背了我们的约定
Your captain reneged on our deal.

630
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:45,300
你们中的一个必须付出代价
One of you must pay for his failure.

631
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,620
我让你来选一个
I will let you choose who.

632
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,290
-再等一下  -好吧  那你来选
- Now hold on a second-- - Okay, then you choose!

633
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:50,100
别这么做  我们是有交易的
Don't do this! We had a deal!

634
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,520
-你做了交易  -我和你们的艇长做了交易
- You made a deal? - I had a deal with your captain.

635
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,720
快点  别等我失去耐心
Quickly, before I lose patience!

636
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,550
别这样对待我们  别玩游戏
Don't put this on us. Don't play games.

637
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,480
我们好好谈谈
Let's talk about this!

638
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,030
好吧  这就是我们的谈判方式
Okay. Then this is how we will talk!

639
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:58,830
好吧  选他
Okay, him!

640
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,150
把他带去吧
Take him.

641
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,230
-什么  不要啊  -我很抱歉  瑞德
- What? Please! - I'm s-sorry, Red.

642
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,350
-我很抱歉  -不不不
- I'm sorry. - No! No, no, no!

643
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:15,060
-我很抱歉  瑞德  -求你了  约什  科泰兹
- I'm sorry, Red. - Please! Josh! Cortez!

644
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,710
瑞德  对不起
Red, I'm sorry!

645
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,400
求你了  不要这样
Please! Don't do this!

646
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,130
科泰兹
Cortez.

647
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,580
约什
Josh.

648
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,480
我现在就可以杀了你
I could kill you right now.

649
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:17,440
你想引发战争吗
Do you want a war?

650
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:33,010
还有一个
There's one more!

651
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,760
不  没有了
No, there is not.

652
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:39,800
你迟到了
You were late.

653
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:01,980
我们走
Let's go.

654
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,030
你有消息了吗
Have you heard anything?

655
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,760
不  还没有  他们...
Uh, no, not yet. They're--

656
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,310
他们现在去交易了
They're doing the switch right now.

657
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,910
你没赶上船
You missed your ride.

658
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:43,480
我总是挑错人
I always pick the wrong ones.

659
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,050
新年的时候  我下定决心
This new year's, I made a resolution

660
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:48,350
不再找坏男人  不再抽烟
to give up bad men and cigarettes,

661
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:51,820
一周后我却躺在刚特曼身边抽烟
And a week later I was smoking in bed next to Guttman.

662
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:52,980
通常这时我会趁机笑话
This is normally where I'd make a joke

663
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,310
和法国男人约会的下场
about dating French men,

664
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:55,300
但是
but...

665
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:57,920
我还是算了吧
I'll let it go.

666
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:01,800
我们会另想办法让你离开这里的
We'll find a way to get you out of here.

667
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,570
你不必为每个人负责的  知道吗
You don't have to be responsible for everyone, you know?

668
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,850
我就是这样一个人
It's kind of what I do.

669
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:11,140
你为什么要选择当兵
Why did you become a soldier?

670
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,580
我们不是士兵  我们是水手
Well, we're not soldiers. We're sailors.

671
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,640
但我年轻的时候有些迷失
But, uh, I was a bit lost early in life.

672
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,360
是大海给我指明了新方向
The water was more forgiving.

673
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,320
你妻子  她也喜欢出海的生活吗
Does your wife--she also likes being on the water?

674
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:28,900
不
No.

675
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,190
听着
uh, look.

676
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,650
我只是想过来感谢你
I just wanted to come by and thank you

677
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:37,420
感谢你的帮助
for what you did.

678
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,890
似乎我每次见你  都要为不同的事感谢你
It seems like every time I see you I'm thanking you for something,

679
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:42,320
我知道你原本是有机会离开的  所以
But I know you had a chance to leave, so...

680
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:44,730
谢谢你
Thank you.

681
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:45,580
何足挂齿
De rien.

682
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,220
-意思就是"不必客气"  -好吧
- That means "You're welcome." - Okay.

683
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,850
说白了就是没什么
Well, literally it means "It's nothing."

684
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:53,850
没这么简单
It wasn't.

685
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,550
跟我走
Giddyup.

686
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:18,290
他杀了瑞德吗
He killed Red?

687
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:20,020
是的
Yes.

688
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,020
行了
Okay then.

689
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,600
你打算去干什么  山姆
What are you going to do, Sam?

690
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,560
一边抵挡整个美国海军
Hold off the entire U.S. Navy on one side

691
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,250
另一边和暴民作战吗
and fight an insurgency on the other?

692
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,170
别犯和其他人一样的错误
Do not make the mistake so many others have.

693
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:34,190
丛林中埋伏着枪手  车下都埋着炸弹
Gunmen in the bushes. A bomb under every vehicle.

694
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,030
我们会伤亡惨重的  
We'd bleed out in a fight.

695
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,220
反正我们也是死路一条了
We're bleeding anyway.

696
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:38,680
你觉得如果让他们知道
What do you think's gonna happen when they know

697
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:40,990
我们让一个岛上暴徒处决了我们的战友会怎样
we let some island thug execute one of our own, huh?

698
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:42,360
-到时候会怎样  -他给我们下了最后期限
- What happens then? - He gave us a deadline

699
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,760
是我们没能达到
which we did not meet.

700
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:45,940
我们不能总让他们忍下去
We can't keep asking more of them.

701
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,780
我们在这里最宝贵的精神
The one thing we have out here--

702
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:50,000
最宝贵的精神  就是对彼此的忠诚
The one thing we have out here-- is our loyalty to each other.

703
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,040
就是那样
That's it!

704
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,800
现在我们得告诉他们  连这个也没有了吗
Now we have to tell them they don't even have that?

705
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,040
被国抛弃  无家可归  现在甚至觉得
No country, no home, and now not even the faith

706
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,380
他们的死也毫无意义吗
that their death would mean something?

707
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,070
我们就眼睁睁看着他们被杀害吗
That we'll just allow them to be murdered?

708
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,420
我儿子的尸体被晾在海军冰库里  不能下葬
My son is lying unburied in a navy freezer

709
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:03,030
作为我不肯投降的代价
as the price for not capitulating,

710
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:06,340
所以你没有资格跟我说什么信念和复仇
so please don't tell me about faith and vengeance!

711
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,720
我们必报此仇
We will respond to this affront

712
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,500
只是眼下时候未到
at the time and place of my choosing.

713
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:18,070
我们不能被困在这儿  马库斯
We can't just get stuck here, Marcus.

714
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,390
我做不到
Can't do it.

715
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,510
现在的情况跟以前不同了  山姆
This is not like before, Sam.

716
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,610
我们在这儿并非是孤立无助
We're not helpless here.

717
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:35,440
等我选定合适的  时机
The time and place...of my choosing.

718
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:01,990
爸
Dad.

719
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:03,850
谢天谢地你来了
Thank god you're here.

720
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:06,250
他们拿走了  他们全拿走了
They took it. They took it all.

721
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,440
好了  没事了  没事了
Okay. It's okay. It's okay.

722
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:22,690
在那里发生了什么
What happened in there?

723
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,040
最后期限过了
Deadline passed.

724
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:27,810
塞拉特将瑞德拖出去  杀了他
Serrat hauled Red out and shot him.

725
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:29,330
瑞德之前顶撞过他
Red had been giving him lip earlier,

726
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:31,060
所以我猜是想拿他开刀
so I guess he was an easy target.

727
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,840
我很抱歉让你受这样的苦
I'm sorry you had to go through that.

728
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:38,790
我们尽了最大努力
We did the best we could.

729
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:44,000
长官  发生那样的事  没人会责怪你的
Forgive me, sir, but no one blames you for what happened.

730
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:52,930
或许你也该好好喝一杯
Maybe you should have one of those.

731
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,000
我们会回家的  我们会好好安葬杰弗里的
We'll get home, we'll bury Jeffrey right.

732
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,480
在阿灵顿公墓鸣枪21响

- You're way out of line here, Anders. - I need to go home, sir.

把它关了
Turn that off.

19

比尔  我是马库斯
This is Marcus, Bill.

比你的艇长还高吗
Higher than your captain?

30
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,010

I know. Don't bother. It's gonna scar up nice.

别让她靠近霍普
Keep her away from him.

40
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,850
别往前走了
Don't take another step.

41
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:39,510
别这么做  我们是有交易的
Don't do this! We had a deal!

42
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,740
别这样  约什
Don't go there,  Josh.

43
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,680
并占领或凿沉美国潜艇科罗拉多号
and seize or scuttle the U.S.S. "Colorado."

44
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,270
不  不  不
No! No, no, no, no!

45
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:53,010
不  不是
No, it wasn't.

46
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,760
不  但他希望别人这么认为
No, but he wants them to think that he is.

47
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,310
不  副艇长  你不能这么做  他情绪混乱
No, X.O., you can't do this. He's messed up.

48
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:19,020
不  霍普现在还不能跋涉  不行
No, Hopper can't travel yet. No way.

49
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,410
不  没有了  你迟到了
No, there is not. You were late.

50
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:15,980
不  你把事情都搞混了
No. You...you're twisting everything up.

51
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:12,540
不  你发过誓要维护和保卫
No, you swore to support and defend

52
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,210
不  我得回去  我得...
No, I got to get back. I got to...

53
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,500
不
No.

54
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,130
不管你们想不想要它
Whether you want it or not.

55
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,770
不管你现在怎么想
Whatever's going through your mind right now,

56
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,900
不管怎样  都会有人说我是个英雄
Either way, somebody's gonna call me a hero.

57
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,100
不行
No. You won't.

58
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,210
不然我就在这里与它玉石俱焚
or I will die on the bottom with it.

59
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,840
不是发射命令  长官
It's not a firing order, sir.

60
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:32,270
不适宜继续指挥  副艇长也一样
unfit for command, as has his X.O.

61
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,840
不受国内外敌人的侵犯
against all enemies, foreign and domestic.

62
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,940
不为世界所知
wasn't noticed by the world.

63
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,370
不要
No. No!

64
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,570
不要浮上海面
We're not going anywhere.

65
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,940
不用的
You didn't.

66
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,630
不知道你注意到没有
Look, I'm not sure if you noticed,

67
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,630
不止一个人有这样的想法
He's not the only one.

68
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,120
布兰伦   请确认我的命令
Mr. Brannan, I want you to confirm that you have heard your orders.

69
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,220
布兰伦  别动  拿好手雷  
Brannan, hold out the grenade and do not move!

70
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,570
布兰伦士官  离开指挥室
Petty Officer Brannan, step off the conn.

71
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:27,820
才能让人们去追寻事实真相
is forcing hard questions to be asked back home.

72
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,700
查普林测试样机的时候
But when Chaplin tested it,

73
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,640
查普林和肯德尔的
for Chaplin and Kendal to be stripped of

74
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,970
场面会失控  我们必死无疑
we lose the controls, we're all dead.

75
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,600
出现发射故障  长官
We have a firing malfunction, ma'am.

76
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,480
出现在"离开"的名单里
right up there with the others.

77
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,270
出现在潜艇频道内的信息
the boat's channels the last few days.

78
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,340
出于道德责任我们挺身而出  挑战权威
when it acts against the best interests of our nation.

79
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,280
此传统能够一直回溯到福吉谷
all the way back to Valley Forge.

80
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:12,380
从我这里偷走珀尔修斯硬盘
to steal the Perseus drive from me.

81
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:43,900
打架的话给我滚出去
Take this outside my bar!

82
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:06,930
打开扬声器
Put it on the speakers.

83
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,210
大到先进的武器系统
to advanced weapons systems,

84
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,950
大家处境都很艰难
This is hard on all of us,

85
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,840
大家都只想回家
Everybody just wants to go home.

86
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,190
大约还需30秒
30 seconds, maybe.

87
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,540
担心其他艇员会怎么想他
What the crew would think of him.

88
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,370
但巴基斯坦已成废墟
But Pakistan is in ruins,

89
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,100
但对我总还抱有信心吧
but you damn well will have faith in me.

90
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:21,730
但副艇长是对的
but the X.O. Is correct.

91
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,490
但还好有切萨皮克港
But there was always the Chesapeake.

92
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,660
但你不能像这样让我措手不及
But you shouldn't have put me on my heels like that.

93
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:34,850
但你得学着
but you're gonna have to learn

94
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,990
但你男友  那个地质学家
But your boyfriend, the geologist,

95
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,580
但你要做出决定  约什
but you need to decide, Josh.

96
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:09,740
但是不管你怎么想...
But whatever's going through your mind--

97
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,530
但是核潜艇副艇长之妻克里斯蒂・肯德尔
But Christine Kendal, wife of nuclear submarine X.O.,

98
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:02,960
但是游戏升级了
But the game has grown.

99
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,570
但他没给我这个机会
but he has taken it out of my hands.

100
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:30,720
但他们当时要杀我们  约什
They tried to kill us, Josh.

101
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:40,580
但我们必须做出抉择
but we do need to decide.

102
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,570
但我需要你的帮助
But I need your help.

103
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,130
但我已拉开手雷保险销
but my grenade is live.

104
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:02,840
但现在不再是了
but not anymore.

105
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:11,290
但休息舱会有冰淇淋
but there will be ice cream on the mess decks.

106
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,390
但这里不是阿灵顿
It ain't Arlington, though.

107
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,810
但这是我唯一的选择
But it's the only choice I had.

108
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,700
但这些都是可矫正的
Those things are curable.

109
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,040
但这也许是很长一段时间内
But it might be the last message

110
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,590
但这一决定是正确的  干得漂亮
but the right one. Well done.

111
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:06,130
当国家的最大利益受到威胁时
under the moral obligation to stand up to authority

112
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,400
当然  都听你的
Of course. Whatever you like.

113
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,350
当我对他说
When I ran the theory past him

114
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,330
当我看见海军的宣传时
I...I just wanted to be in the navy

115
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,220
倒计时三  二...
Impact in three, two...

116
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,070
到封锁区需要四小时
You're four hours out from the blockade.

117
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,720
得到妥当安排
can be arranged."

118
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,620
第二次是加入潜艇任务
and again by signing up for submariner duty.

119
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,330
第一次是加入海军
once when they joined the navy,

120
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,030
懂了
Understood.

121
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,730
赌注已经超出你的能力范围
The stakes are out of your league.

122
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:58,890
对  不能
No, you're not.

123
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:42,980
对哦  顽强的男人
Right. Tough guy.

124
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,180
-舵手留在原位  -是  长官
- Helm remain stationed. - Yes, sir.

125
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,510
而你却在某处享受汉普顿斯宝座
with you sitting on a Hamptons throne somewhere

126
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,860
而且她没钱  所以来不了
she has no money, so she can't just come,

127
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:54,150
而且我要亲手把你  肯德尔和查普林艇长
Besides, I'm gonna paddle you, Kendal, and Captain Chaplin

128
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,530
而是变得完美
We drill to be perfect.

129
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,080
而是一种誓言
It's a declaration.

130
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,320
而现在数据就在那个硬盘上
which is now also on that drive.

131
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,380
发现新目标  方位0-9-7度
New contact bearing 0-9-7.

132
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,600
发现鱼雷  方位0-2-7度
Torpedo in the water bearing 0-2-7.

133
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,450
放下枪
Lower your weapon.

134
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,200
费舍  我们走
Fish, let's roll.

135
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,950
浮上海面的潜艇在战斗中毫无作用  长官
In combat, a ship on the surface is a dead ship, sir.

136
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,120
副艇长  连线
X.O., open the channel.

137
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:05,930
副艇长  请和我们的轮机长谈谈
X.O., please speak with our engineer.

138
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,840
副艇长大人
Anyway, X.O., huh?

139
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,700
副艇长接管指挥台
X.O. On the conn.

140
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:39,450
赋予我一切
Gave me everything I have,

141
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:23,260
搞什么
What the...

142
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:20,540
告诉你那亲爱的水手  他的话会被转达
Tell your sweet sailor his message will be delivered.

143
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,980
格蕾丝  你得学着辨别
Grace, you're gonna want to learn to recognize

144
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,160
根本不存在  都被销毁了
It doesn't exist. It's wiped clean.

145
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,500
估计好久你都看不厌
Don't think you'll tire of that too soon.

146
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:30,100
滚出我家
Get off my property!

147
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,680
还好
Yeah.

148
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,610
还没到开香槟庆祝的时候
It's not time to pop champagne,

149
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,080
还能信任他们去做什么呢
what can we trust them to do?

150
00:03:59,070 --> 00:03:59,790
还有...
There's--

151
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,460
还有我们和瑞德一起的经历
What we went through with Red.

152
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:50,740
还有一个
There's one more!

153
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,970
海军生涯让我更了解自己
The navy saw more in me than I saw in myself.

154
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:07,260
海面被照得粉亮
it lights up the water all pink.

155
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,840
-海员  返航  -是  长官
- Nav, take us home. - Aye, sir.

156
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,230
行动
Let's go.

157
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,290
好
Okay.

158
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,040
好
Yeah.

159
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,360
好吧  但我希望全体艇员
Fine. But I expect the crew

160
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,310
好吧  选他  把他带去吧
Okay, him. Take him.

161
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:54,950
好吧
Okay.

162
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:48,670
好的
Okay.

163
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,550
好好保护这个岛
to care for it.

164
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,090
何时艇长是打定主意不会改的了
when the captain's made up his mind.

165
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,060
和副艇长山姆・肯德尔所犯罪行
and executive officer Samuel Kendal,

166
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,970
嗨  宝贝
Hi, babe.

167
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,300
嗨  宝贝
Hi, babe.

168
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,690
很多医务工作者都离开了这座岛
A lot of hospital workers got off this island.

169
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,060
很好
Good.

170
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,750
很神奇
It's magical.

171
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,830
华府向我们下达了发射命令吗
D.C.'s giving us a firing order?

172
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,020
华莱士  冷静点
Hey, cool it, Wallace!

173
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,100
回屋里吧
Come back inside.

174
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,960
或留下听我指挥
"whether to remain under my command

175
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,210
或荣誉遣散
"or to be honorably dismissed.

176
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,090
或许吧
Yeah. Maybe.

177
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,570
或许我们该让他们回家
So maybe we let them.

178
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,640
或许我们可以给他们选择
Maybe we give them the choice.

179
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,460
霍普  躺好别动  兄弟
Hop. Hang in there, buddy.

180
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,980
霍普  挺住啊
Hopper, stay with me!

181
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,550
霍普  兄弟
Hopper, buddy.

182
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,170
霍普
Hop.

183
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:24,890
吉尔
Gil!

184
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,170
即核武器的优先购买权
the preemptive use of nuclear force.

185
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,980
即将达成的《博尔顿声明》
for what is coming to be called "The Bolton Doctrine,"

186
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,470
几小时之后美国就发动了核轰炸
and a few hours later the U.S. is nuking the joint?

187
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,620
计时开始
The clock starts now.

188
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:35,740
坚持住  兄弟
Okay, buddy.

189
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,990
见鬼  我现在身处通往世界末日的特快列车
Hell, I got front-row seats to the end of the world.

190
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,490
建议上浮海面进行艇体维修
The recommendation is surface to repair.

191
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,330
鉴于我们当前的处境
"given our circumstances, it is only right

192
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:40,500
将产生数十亿美元的利润
yielding hundreds of billions of dollars in profits."

193
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,170
将艇载18枚三叉戟核弹之一
fired one of its 18 trident missiles,

194
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,700
接受他人的援助之手
how to accept help when it's offered.

195
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:33,090
接下来的事情是我们指挥官的错
what was about to happen was our commander's fault.

196
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,810
结束演习
Drill concluded.

197
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,330
截止时间一过  他就说
And once the deadline passed, he said that

198
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,670
截止时间越来越近
As the deadline approached,

199
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:09,920
今日遭到海军部正式起诉
have been officially indicted today by the department of the navy.

200
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:28,220
今天按原计划  集合演习
assembled and ready to drill-- today, as scheduled.

201
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,190
今天就和布兰伦和科泰兹谈
Sitting down with Brannan and Cortez today.

202
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:19,320
今晚在她马里兰州的家门口前
lashed out at reporters tonight

203
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,650
进行安全轮班了
to safely man a shift.

204
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,000
进来
Come in.

205
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,130
就必须知道事情的真相
I need to know what this is really about.

206
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:39,940
就不那么理想了
is another story.

207
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,100
就跟设计的一模一样
just like it was supposed to,

208
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,600
就开始追踪数据
the minute the "Colorado" left port.

209
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,000
就全完了  别那么做
this thing is over. Don't do it.

210
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,910
就是对彼此的忠诚  就是那样
is our loyalty to each other. That's it!

211
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,020
就要击沉我们的舰艇吗
30 minutes after we picked you up?

212
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,930
就在5天之前  科罗拉多号潜艇
It's been just five days since the "Colorado"

213
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,490
据预测在未来几年中将无限膨胀
is predicted to explode in the coming years,

214
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,810
距离  4000码
Range--4,000 yards.

215
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:52,190
距离太远  不可能把手雷拿那么久
It's too far. You'll never hold them off that long.

216
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,500
开会
at the Pentagon tomorrow.

217
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,590
开启鱼雷发射程序
Firing point procedures,

218
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,500
开始考虑留下来吗
the boys think twice about turning tail?

219
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,930
看看这个岛
Look at it.

220
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,630
看来我哪都不用去了
Guess I'm not going anywhere.

221
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,230
看起来像是背叛了我的兄弟
It's like I've betrayed my brother.

222
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,490
科利那群人想此事就此了结
Curry and the others want this whole mess to just go away.

223
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,510
可如果他不选的话  我们三个都得死
If he hadn't, it would have been all three of us.

224
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,690
可是他带走了瑞德
but he took Red away,

225
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,110
可是艇员的表现...
But our crew...

226
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,890
克里斯蒂  我是保罗
Christine, it's me-- Paul.

227
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:24,740
克里斯蒂
Christine!

228
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,090
肯德尔女士  看这里  看这里
Mrs. Kendal, over here! Over here!

229
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:44,360
肯德尔女士  怎么不说说你的看法
Mrs. Kendal, why won't you make a statement?

230
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,980
肯德尔女士
Mrs. Kendal, what do you think

231
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,170
快点  我们走  加快速度
Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!

232
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,520
快滚开
Get off now!

233
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:16,910
来
Come on.

234

来对付他们  那么制作样机的人
against them, who better to figure out

235
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,340
离我的人远点儿  尤其是霍普
Stay away from my guys, especially Hopper.

236
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,670
离我远点
Leave me alone!

237
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,990
立刻清舱
I want this deck cleared now!

238
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,240
立正
Ten-hut!

239
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,760
连线怎么样了  山姆
How we doing on that call, Sam?

240
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,450
另外五名队员  包括华莱士
Five other crewmen, including Wallace,

241
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,090
马库斯・查普林艇长"
"Captain Marcus Chaplin."

242
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,380
马库斯・查普林已被认定为
Marcus Chaplin has been deemed

243
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,810
马库斯现在自诩为华盛顿再世了吗
Marcus thinks he's George Washington now?

244
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,170
马上连上了
It's coming online now.

245
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,730
没错  你太重要了  我们不能让你走
You were right. You're too important to let go, Anders.

246
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:23,870
没人那么想  孩子
No one thinks that, son.

247
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:53,980
没人能帮上我
there's no one.

248
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,290
没人想  这不是我一个人的想法  长官
None of us did. And I'm not the only one, sir.

249
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:46,940
没有  长官
No, sir.

250
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,590
没有
No.

251
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:12,790
没有财产  也不重要
No wealth, no importance.

252
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,790
没有我们他们就得投降  我们就能回家了
Without us, they have to surrender, and we all go home.

253
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,420
每个会极大影响艇员情绪的决定
that will radically affect the disposition of my crew.

254
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,700
每个人都觉得我是个懦夫
Everyone thinks I'm a coward.

255
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,790
每每我朝港口看都能看见船只
And I'd look out there and I'd see those ships.

256
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,390
每名艇员皆应享有选择权利
"that you should each have the choice

257
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:57,220
每一名艇员都要做出决定
Everyone on this crew needs to decide.

258
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,600
美国公民资格埋下伏笔
their rights as American citizens,

259
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,440
美利坚合众国宪法
the Constitution of the United States

260
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,390
明白
Okay.

261
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,300
命令变了
Orders change.

262
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,770
目前华府局势十分紧张
where tensions remain high.

263
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,450
拿着
Take it.

264
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,000
那边有一半艇员都要放弃了
Half their crew's about to bug out.

265
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,580
那好  我们带上吉尔然后消失
Fine. We'll grab Gil and be out of your way.

266
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,340
那就是我的出路
That was my way out.

267
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,710
那可是国防部长  我不知道该做什么
It's the secretary of defense. I-I didn't know what to do.

268
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,620
那能帮得了你什么
And that helps you how?

269
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:31,750
那时我就知道
And I knew...

270
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,570
那是不可能的  我已经
Well, that's not possible. I've--

271
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,120
那是我们的钱
That is our money.

272
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,540
那条命令  998
The order. 998.

273
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,840
-那未来是...  -不  我保护了我们家族的未来
- a future that-- - No, I protected our family's future.

274
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,860
那知情不报呢
Well, what about not reporting it?

275
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:33,910
难道美国采取军事管制
The U.S. under martial law,

276
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,130
难道你没想过为什么你们获救
You ever ask yourself why the "Illinois"

277
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,850
脑子不清楚  我们不能这样杀了他
He's not thinking straight. We can't just kill him.

278
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,990
能让精力集中  我懂的
Keeps the mind focused. I get it.

279
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:54,860
你爱他  对不对
You loved him, didn't you?

280
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:20,300
你把我们家族的未来拱手让出
You just handed over our family's future,

281
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,250
你并不孤单
You're not alone.

282
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,500
你不懂
You don't get it.

283
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:34,580
你不想呆在这儿  不是有去留板吗
You don't like your situation here, there's a "Stay/Go" list.

284
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,680
你不需要担心我
You don't have to worry about me.

285
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,620
你不用选择
You didn't have to choose that.

286
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,360
你承诺要把它发送出去  而不是留下欣赏
You promised to send that, not watch it.

287
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,410
你打算去干什么  山姆
What are you gonna do, Sam?

288
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,130
你打算怎么处理放在我冷藏库的尸体
What are you planning on doing with the body in my refrigerator?

289
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:15,100
你当然明白  他那些话不是对你说的
You realize, of course, that he's not talking to you.

290
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,160
你当时别无选择
You had no choice.

291
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:08,540
你到底站在哪边
What do you really stand for?

292
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:19,840
你的弟兄怎么样了
How's your man?

293
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,390
你的科学技术  化学药品
Your science, your chemicals.

294
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,370
你对你丈夫的行为怎么看
about your husband's actions?

295
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:57,110
你对珀尔修斯付出了很多
You worked very hard on Perseus.

296
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,460
你个愚蠢的狗娘养的乡巴佬...
you stupid hillbilly son of a--

297
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,960
你还不明白  对吧
You don't get it, do you?

298
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,510
你很快就会觉得好受一些的
It's gonna feel better real soon.

299
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,610
你很快就会看到一些艇员回家了
You're gonna see some of the crew coming home soon.

300
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,100
你将会被严密监视
You're gonna be under a microscope.

301
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,420
你觉得你丈夫是个恐怖分子吗
Do you consider your husband to be a terrorist?

302
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:46,900
你觉得他会让三等士官来掌管核反应堆吗
You think he's gonna trust some PO3 to run his reactor?

303
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,360
你觉得他是个叛徒吗
Do you feel he's a traitor?!

304
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,530
你觉得我会错过吗
You think I'm missing that?

305
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,400
你今天赢回很多人心  先生
You won back a lot of hearts and minds today, sir.

306
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:57,940
你就像我刚来的时候
You're like me when I first arrived.

307
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,540
你看见去留板了吗
You saw the "Stay/Go" List?

308
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,080
你看上去很帅
You look good.

309
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,690
你可以解散了  上尉
You're dismissed, Lieutenant.

310
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,970
你可以在检阅前先到达潜艇
You can be on board before the muster--

311
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,650
你肯定可以找到人帮忙的  爸
There must be someone you can talk to, dad.

312
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,120
你肯定已经听说过有人
I'm sure you've heard about the attempt

313
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,850
你来做什么
What are you doing here?

314
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,080
你们必须为我继续履行自己的职责
You will execute your duties for the chief of boat.

315
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,940
你们带着一名伤兵从巴基斯坦匆忙撤离
You guys bug out of Pakistan with a wounded man,

316
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,520
你们的任务是终止他们的统治
Your orders are to terminate command,

317
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,360
你们的政府现在已将他们视作敌对势力
Your government now considers them enemy combatants.

318
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,120
你们都死定了
You guys are all dead.

319
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,780
你们可能不信任艇长
You may not have faith in your captain,

320
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:34,840
-你们两个跟我来  -是  长官
- You two, come with me. - Yes, sir.

321
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,710
你们俩都穿戴的很整齐啊
Well, look at you two all dressed up.

322
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,450
你们艇长违背了我们的约定
Your captain reneged on our deal.

323
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,180
你们为什么不报道他们
Why aren't you reporting about them, huh?!

324
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,190
你们为什么监视我
Why are you watching me?!

325
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,190
你们为什么要监视我
Why are you watching me?!

326
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,150
你们现在是这岛上的主宰力量
You are the power on this island now.

327
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,990
你们在任何时间因为任何原因被分开过吗
Were you ever separated at any time for any reason?

328
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,150
你们中的一个必须付出代价
One of you must pay for his failure.

329
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:27,360
你那边现在是何情况
What's your current situation?

330
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,120
你男朋友说你需要的一切
Everything your boyfriend said you needed.

331
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,790
你能把这个带出岛吗
You gonna be able to get this off the island?

332
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,010
你确定要这样做吗
Are you sure you wanna do that?

333
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,520
你认为还有其他的原因吗
You think that might have something to do with it?

334
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,200
-你认为我们还能坚持多久  -坐好
- How long you think this is gonna last... - Sit.

335
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,540
你是否单独行动  是否有反抗
Are you acting alone? Is there resistance?

336
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,960
你是个硬汉  霍普
You're a hard man, Hop.

337
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,480
你是说瑞德吗
You talking about Red?

338
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,140
你睡着了
You fell asleep.

339
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,820
你说的每一句话  做的每一件事
Everything you say, everything you do--

340
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,620
你说什么呢  遇到什么不测
What are you talking about? What's gonna happen to you?

341
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:25,160
你偷了一艘核潜艇  还向我们的国家开火
You stole a nuclear submarine a-and fired on our country!

342
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:44,060
你为总统做过那么多事
Well, after everything you have done for this president,

343
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,070
你违抗了一个直接命令
You disobeyed a direct order.

344
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,950
你想找队里的人谈话  就找我吧
You wanna talk to someone on my team, you talk to me.

345
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:08,760
你要坚强起来
You're gonna be unbreakable.

346
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,950
你要这样说的话  听着确实很恶劣
I guess it sounds pretty bad when you put it like that.

347
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,740
-你也是  -你是做了决定
- as were yours. - You've made your decision,

348
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,730
你一切都具备
There you have it.

349
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,520
你以为会怎样  我会蜷缩成一团泣不成声吗
What'd you think, I was just gonna roll up in a ball and cry?

350
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,210
你应该埋在阿灵顿
You deserve Arlington.

351
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,380
你有什么事要告诉我吗  凯希尔
Something you want to tell me, Cahill?

352
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,220
你有什么消息给我
Now what news do you have for me?

353
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,720
你在珀尔修斯系统研发中表现得很出色
You did a wonderful job on Perseus.

354
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:42,230
你在与权威抗衡
You're standing up to authority.

355
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,970
你在这件事里加入了太多私人感情
You're taking this too personally.

356
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,110
你怎么看待这两件事间的联系
How do you connect the dots?

357
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,810
你这次务必要信任我
You just have to trust me this time.

358
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,820
你真觉得你能打破这份信仰吗
You really think you can break that kind of devotion?

359
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:37,660
你真幸运  没打碎什么东西
You're lucky you didn't break anything.

360
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,610
你只能照做
you do it.

361
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,360
你只是太固执  尚未认清那一点
You're just too stubborn to see that yet.

362
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,300
你只想要志愿兵吗
You're looking for volunteers?

363
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,190
你知道我怎么想的吗
You know what I think?

364
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,710
你准备好就开拍
Whenever you're ready.

365
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,060
你自尊心强  这很好
Okay, you're proud, that's good,

366
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,240
你做得很好
You did good.

367
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,820
怒斥记者
in front of her Maryland home.

368
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,680
-其实是假的  是吧  -抱歉  你什么意思
- It's a load of crap, right? - Sorry. How do you mean?

369
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,620
牵涉叛国以及针对美国的恐怖行为"
"relating to acts of treason and terrorism against the United States."

370
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,710
签下名字离开不就行了
Why don't you just sign up and leave?

371
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:22,190
前一秒还好好的
One day everything's normal,

372
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,410
潜艇现已安全
Ship is secure.

373
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,060
欠债就得还
And debts are paid.

374
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,700
情况不是很好
He's not doing so good, man.

375

请进
Enter.

376
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:14,870
请问是谁
Who am I speaking with?

377
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,640
请指示
I request instructions.

378
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,700
去床上睡吧
Get yourself to bed.

379
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,290
去或留
Stay, go--

380
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,530
去哪里都比在这里强
Better odds than staying here, man.

381
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:18,610
去死
Hell with it.

382
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,210
全球强烈谴责
This universal condemnation

383
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,730
全体注意  我是你们的艇长
Attention all hands, this is your Captain.

384
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,790
劝服我花了那么多钱进行测试
when he persuaded me to spend so much of my money to run tests.

385
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:37,860
却让农民吃蛋糕吗
letting the peasants eat cake?

386
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:50,390
确实如此
It does.

387
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:08,930
然而  总统却私下会见了我父亲
Instead, the President personally called my father,

388
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,840
然后他就拿枪指着约什
Then he put his gun on Josh.

389
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,970
然后他就跑了
And then he ran away.

390
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,850
然后我们听到四声枪响
and... we heard four gunshots.

391
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:54,160
让他们都去死吧
Screw 'em, right?

392
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,010
任何在过去几天内
anything that might have come through

393
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,420
如果没人再朝他开枪  就算他走运了
He'll be lucky if someone doesn't take another shot at him.

394
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,720
如果你对我有所隐瞒  会让我很难办
I can't do my job if you keep me in the dark.

395
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:04,560
如果你想回家  约什  那件事之后
If you wanted to go home, Josh, after what happened...

396
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:23,480
如果你要跟我谈话
If you need to speak to me,

397
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,080
如果你愿意  我可以让艇上的医务兵
If you want, I could have one of the corpsman

398
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,560
如果你在"离开"那栏签了名
If you put your name on that "Go" List,

399
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,260
如果他们担心查普林会用我的样机
If they're worried Chaplin is gonna use my prototype

400
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,780
如果他问艇员们是不是想回家
Well, if he asks the men if they want to go home,

401
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,500
如果我们不能信任他们会留下来
And if we can't trust them to stay,

402
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,050
如果我们没发射那颗核弹
And if we hadn't fired that nuke,

403
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,000
如果我要说服他们留下来
And if I'm gonna convince them to stay,

404
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:38,950
如果我遇到不测
If, uh, something were to happen to me--

405
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:04,940
如果这是真格的
If this were the real deal,

406
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:26,830
如果真的有矿产  这个会是绿色
If the minerals were there, this test would be green.

407
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,950
如果真那样  我们就没有足够的人手
If that happens, we're not gonna have enough

408
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:49,320
如何最好地坚守我们立下的誓言
How do we best uphold the oath we took?

409
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,980
塞拉让我们自己选谁去死
Serrat made us choose who would die.

410
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,270
塞拉特频繁地过来
Serrat would check in more often,

411
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,770
山姆・肯德尔  美军潜艇科罗拉多号副艇长
And Sam Kendal, executive officer of the U.S.S. "Colorado"

412
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,870
山姆被海军停薪了
Navy's cut off Sam's pay.

413
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,780
山姆的父母也帮不上什么忙
and Sam's parents are no help.

414
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,780
上岸给他做个检查
come up from the boat and have a look at him.

415
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,170
上百年来  这个小岛都不为
For centuries, this island wasn't--

416
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,930
上尉  读一下
Read it, Lieutenant.

417
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,840
上尉  干得不错
Well done, Lieutenant.

418
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,000
-上尉  护送他出去  -是  长官
- Lieutenant, escort the chief out. - Yes, sir.

419
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,590
上尉  让潜艇继续航行是个大胆的命令
Keeping this boat moving was a gutsy call, Lieutenant,

420
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,290
稍等
Wait a second.

421
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,150
稍息
At ease.

422
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,390
设定航线驶往封锁区
Set a course for the blockade,

423
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,240
射向我国首都以东200英里海域
detonating it 200 miles off the coast of our nation's capital,

424
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:45,520
什么会
What for?

425
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,660
甚至考虑到二人为艇上指挥官...
and even allows for the two men in charge of the U.S.S...

426
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,950
士官布兰伦要和国防部长通话
Petty Officer Brannan would like to speak to the secretary of defense.

427
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,570
士官约什・布兰伦在我身边
I'm here with Petty Officer Josh Brannan,

428
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,810
似乎戳到了他的软肋
seemed like it rang his bell.

429
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,450
-试图谋害艇长了吧  -是的  他没事吧
- on the Captain's life. - Yeah. Is he okay?

是啊
Yeah.

435
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,490
是单独行动
I'm alone.

436
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:10,630
是的  长官  明白  炸掉潜艇
Yes, sir, I heard you. Sink the boat.

437
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,010
是个绝对"美好的早晨"
It's a damn fine "good morning."

438
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,310
是海豹突击队害我们遇袭的
that his S.E.A.L. guys got us shot at,

439
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:07,880
是会这样的
Yeah. That was always coming.

440
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,500
是吗  考虑什么
Oh, yeah? Which is what?

441
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:39,650

00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,460
是吗  你知道回去等待我们的是什么吗
Yeah? 'cause you know what's waiting for us back home?

443
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,390
是你们艇长违抗了直接命令
Well, your captain disobeyed a direct order.

444
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,480
是他们不想任何人知道科罗拉多号
They don't want anyone to know where the "Colorado" was

445
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,850
是我的错
It's my fault.

446
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:51,100
是新任国防部秘书长科利召开的
it's a meeting with the new secretary of Defense--Curry.

447
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,720
是诸多高科技产品的关键  小到手机
key components in everything from cell phones

448
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,960
收到紧急行动指令  长官
Emergency action message, sir.

449
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,850
收到了同样的信息
received the same message.

450
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,790
收到一条信息算不上什么罪行
It's not a crime to receive a message.

451
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,810
恕我直言  它已经放在那里一星期了
I'm sorry. It's just-- it's been there for a week.

452
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,630
谁  是谁更改了命令
Who? Who changed the orders?

453
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,280
-谁的命令  -头衔高于你们的上级
- From who? - A higher authority than you.

454
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,140
谁给你下的命令  华莱士
Who were your orders from, huh, Wallace?

455
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:16,450
谁知道我们回去会遭遇什么
Who knows how safe things are gonna be for us back there?

456
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,670
说  谁下的命令
Huh? Who were they from?

457
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,910
送上叛国罪的被告席
right to your treason trial.

458
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,680
算了吧
Let it go.

459
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:16,390
所以才能保留它的美丽
So it was allowed to remain beautiful.

460
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,150
所以你们有责任
So you have the responsibility

461
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,580
所以你说得太对了  我是加入了私人感情
So you're damn right I am taking this personally.

462
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,550
所以你为他奋斗
That's why you fought for him.

463
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,780
所以你暂时和我们在一起
So for now, you're stuck with us.

464
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,270
所以如果我能让女兵们
So I get you the whole female compliment

465
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:38,980
所以他跟我在一起
He stays with me.

466
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,040
所以我所做的这些决定
So what I've done, the choice I've made--

467
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,770
所有人离开指挥室
Everyone off this conn.

468
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,690
索菲  拜托
Sophie, please...

469
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,650
他不是我的艇长
He's not my captain!

470
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,240
他搞军事演习到底是想干什么
What the hell's he got us drilling for, anyway?

471
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,130
他和你一样  是我的敌人
He's the enemy, just like you.

472
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,920
他很好  我得确保他的安全
He's fine. I want to keep it that way.

473
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,610
他很忠诚
He's a true blue, this one.

474
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:20,430
他控制了潜艇
who has taken control of the boat.

475
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:28,880
他拉了保险销
The pin's out!

476
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,570
他们不肯说  但是我知道是
Well, they won't say, but it's a--

477
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,460
他们不停地更改命令
They change all the time.

478
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,260
他们不想让你知道科罗拉多号
They didn't want you to know where the "Colorado" was

479
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:29,310
他们对科罗拉多号上发生的事满口谎言
They are lying about what happened to the "Colorado"!

480
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,130
他们对科罗拉多号上发生的事满口谎言
They're lying about what happened to the "Colorado"!

481
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,310
他们会再次挺身而出吗
will they raise their hands again?

482
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,250
他们叫我们叛徒
They're calling us traitors.

483
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,250
他们就成功了
they would have succeeded.

484
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,520
他们去打捞牡蛎
They dive for oysters.

485
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,770
他们为什么要偷走我们为他们设计的武器系统
why would they steal the very thing we built for them?

486
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,820
他们想把此事淹没在海底
They want to bury it at the bottom of the ocean.

487
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,720
他们想拿它干什么  他为什么要拿走它
What do they want with it? Why would he take it?

488
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,430
他杀了瑞德吗
He killed Red?

489
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,390
他是对的  长官
He is right about that, sir.

490
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,030
他是我弟弟
He was my brother.

491
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,580
-他是我们的一员  -一旦那颗手榴弹在指挥室引爆
- He's one of us. - That grenade goes off on the conn,

492
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:17,750
他是因为我才死的
And he's dead because of me.

493
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,870
他无论如何都不会让我回家的
He's not gonna let me go home no matter what.

494
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,940
他先问的我  可我没有选
He asked me first, and I wouldn't do it.

495
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:01,750
他也在威胁我的潜艇  还有我的弟兄
He's threatening my boat, too. And my men on it.

496
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,990
他已经问过他那些爱将 
He's consulted with the military gods he adores so much,

497
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,600
他以为自己刀枪不入
He thinks he's bulletproof.

498
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,260
他早就算计过了
He's done the calculations.

499
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,400
他之前对这一切充满激情
he was so enthusiastic about all of this

500
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,680
他知道那些人留不住了
and he knows he's lost 'em.

501
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,050
它被卡住了
It's jammed.

502
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,630
它从科罗拉多号离港
It began tracking data

503
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,610
它现在是你们的了
And it's yours now.

504
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,060
她有信念  坠入了爱河
Well, she's got faith. She's in love.

505
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,210
太多私人感情
Too personally?

506
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:03,920
太阳落山时
And when the sun gets low,

507
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,310
提醒我们时间不多了
reminding us that our time was getting short.

508
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,820
提议启动应急吹排水系统
Recommend emergency blow.

509
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,100
天啊
oh, god.

510
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,390
听我说  我跟前面四个人都说过
Okay, look, like I've told the last four people,

511
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,840
听我说
Hey. Listen to me.

512
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,860
听着  很抱歉  但是我不想留在这
Listen, I'm sorry, but I don't want to be here.

513
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,570
听着  科泰兹  你在全艇很有影响力
Listen, Cortez, you hold a lot of sway,

514
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,790
听着  我的战友们就要离开了
Hey, I'm about to lose my crew.

515
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,940
听着  要不是确定我们的选择是对的
Listen, if I didn't know we were doing the right thing,

516
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:58,940
听着
Listen to me.

517
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,210
听着
Listen.

518
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,000
停止前进
Full stop.

519
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,190
艇上军心动摇
We got a serious morale problem.

520
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,660
艇上每位成员都志愿加入过两次
Every member of this crew has already volunteered twice--

521
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,140
艇员们  立正
Crew, atten-hut!

522
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,260
艇员正在用排水泵进行排水
lined up to de-water with drain pump.

523
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,950
艇长的那个名单
Uh, the captain's list--

524
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:23,610
艇长和我都很感激你的贡献
The captain and I both appreciate your service.

525
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,780
-退后  别逼我  -后退  后退
- Just get back, damn it! - Stand down! Stand down!

526
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:04,930
退后
Back away!

527
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:18,510
陀螺定位系统
built into the prototype.

528
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,810
为什么到这来找我
Why are you here?

529
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,890
为什么要污蔑我的丈夫  你们这群懦夫
Why are you lying about my husband, you cowards?!

530
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:25,000
为什么要污蔑我的丈夫  你们这群懦夫
Why are you lying about my husband, you cowards?!

531
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,250
为什么又改变主意了
Why the change of heart?

532
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,340
为他的政府贡献那么多
for his administration,

533
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:58,670
唯一一份价值数十亿美元的系统说明
to steal the only specs of a multibillion-dollar system.

534
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,940
问询是应该的  但不要拘留任何人
Well, they'll be questioned, but no one's getting detained.

535
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:24,960
我帮不了你了  谢帕德上将  抱歉
I can't help you anymore, Admiral Shepard. I'm sorry.

536
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:23,220
我保证你的想法是错的
'cause I sure as hell don't.

537
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,300
我本来可能错过很多乐趣啊
Just think the fun I would have missed.

538
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,750
我必须回家  长官
I gotta go home, sir.

539
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,190
我不行了  詹姆斯  救救我
It's bad, James. I need help.

540
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,900
我不会就这么善罢甘休的
I'm not gonna let it go.

541
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,970
我不会扔下任何人
I'm not leaving anyone behind.

542
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,580
我不会是其中之一
I'm not gonna be one of them.

543
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,000
我不觉得我们
You know, I don't think you and I

544
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,570
我不能问怎么运  对不对
I'm not gonna ask how, am I?

545
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,530
我带着敬意  坚决要求你事先知会我
and I respectfully insist that you inform me of any decision

546
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,810
我得跟你谈谈
I need to talk to you for a minute.

547
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,630
我得跟你谈谈约什的事
I have to talk to you about Josh.

548
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,610
我得回家
I got to get home.

549
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:29,130
我得考虑长远些
I'm taking the long view.

550
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,030
我得找个地方把我朋友放下
I need a place to keep my friend

551
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,290
我的车没油了  食物也吃光了
There's no gas in my car, no groceries.

552
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:13,980
我的错
I did it.

553
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,690
我的姐姐  她得抚养孩子  所以...
My sister-- she's got the kids, so...

554
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,230
我的名字被挪地方了
My name's been moved.

555
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,060
我的名字会和其他人一样
my name would be on that "Go" List,

556
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,530
我的母亲  身体不是很好
My mom--she's not well, and...

557
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,360
我的人就守在附近
My men are nearby.

558
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,070
我都有按时付款
all of my payments are current.

559
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,890
我发过誓要保卫我的国家
I swore to defend my nation!

560
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,120
我关机了
Yeah, I turned my phone off.

561
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:27,580
我还有
I got...

562
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,250
我和吉尔一起出过三次任务
I did three tours with Gil.

563
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,040
-我很抱歉  瑞德  -约什  科泰兹
- Red, I'm sorry! - Josh! Cortez!

564
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,230
我会保证其执行
and l'll see that it's carried out.

565
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,170
我会陪你走过每一步  好吗
And I'm gonna be there every step of the way. Okay?

566
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,670
我会找人治好你的  万珀  照顾好他
I'm gonna get you fixed up. Viper, stay with him.

567
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,940
我几乎就要发了
And I almost did.

568
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,040
我将像往常一样登艇  和全艇成员一起
and I'll board the way I always have--with my crew.

569
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,660
我觉得他们以吗啡抵价获取离岛的船票
I think they paid you in morphine for their tickets out.

570
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,090
我就想当海军
I saw in the damn commercials, you know?

571
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,780
我就站在这
I'm standing right here.

572
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:01,990
我看上去还行吗
Do I look okay?

573
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,260
我没事
I'm fine!

574
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,970
我没想参与这件事
I didn't sign up for this.

575
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,180
我们16点整开始检阅
We muster at 1600,

576
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,450
我们被关在同一间屋子里  双手绑在背后
We were all held in the same room with our hands behind our backs.

577
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,620
我们彼此承诺过
We made each other promises.

578
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,820
我们不能总让他们忍下去
We can't keep asking more of them.

579
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,100
我们查了家庭电报
We've been through the familygrams.

580
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,030
我们打算拘留他们  进行问询
We'll detain them all for questioning.

581
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,790
我们得马上撤出去
We gotta leave right now!

582
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:25,290
我们的存在
Our mere presence

583
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,650
我们的国家是在抗争中建立的
Our country was founded in protest,

584
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:35,080
我们的政府遭到盟国的谴责
our government condemned by our allies.

585
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,440
我们改变了一些事  是吗
I guess we changed things a bit, didn't we?

586
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:06,090
我们根本就不应该在这
We shouldn't even be here!

587
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,500
我们还是失去了很多好艇员
Still, we're losing a lot of good people.

588
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,050
我们很有可能顺利逃生
there's every likelihood we'd all still be alive.

589
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,610
我们会损失3/4甚至更多的人
We're gonna lose three-quarters or more.

590
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,980
我们将再次操练鱼雷攻击方案
We will commence torpedo attack scenario once again.

591
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:41,420
我们绝不能引火上身
so we are going to sit this one out.

592
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,280
我们祈求
We begged,

593
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,840
我们提前10秒完成了演习任务
We shaved ten seconds off our time.

594
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,010
我们为什么杀了那家伙
Why did we kill that guy?

595
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,360
我们无法保证你的安全
We can't guarantee your safety.

596
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,460
我们先护送你上船吧
Let us get you a ride to the boat.

597
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:36,850
我们相当敌对  长官
We couldn't be farther apart, sir.

598
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,580
我们需要你的帮助
We could use your help.

599
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:13,970
我们也许得在这待一阵子
We may be here a while.

600
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,710
我们一起出生入死
We went through buds together.

601
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,450
我们一起离开这里
and get the hell out of dodge.

602
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,290
我们已经掌握了详情
We've put together a detail.

603
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:14,030
我们有船  所以带上吉尔的尸体和霍普
We have a boat. Let's grab Gil's body and Hopper,

604
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,630
我们在这里最宝贵的精神
The one thing we have out here

605
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,430
我们之前说的不对
It wasn't like we said.

606
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,820
我们只能这样
And that's just what we're gonna do.

607
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,470
我能拿几个箱子"
and how many bags can I take?"

608
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,960
我取了很多样本
I took many samples.

609
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,420
我确定
I know it.

610
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:37,730
我让你来选一个
I will let you choose who.

611
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,010
我让他们怎么做呢
And what would I ask them?

612
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,800
我认为你高估了愿意留下的人数  长官
I think you overestimate how many of them will stay, sir.

613
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,800
我是本舰上有权接触核武器的高级长官
I'm the senior nuke-rated chief on this boat.

614
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,170
我是队长吉尔・兰斯顿  谢谢你们的支援
Gil Langston, Captain. Thank you for the pickup.

615
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,650
我是国防部长科利
This is secretary of defense Curry.

616
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:10,080
我是一名美国公民  我不会保持缄默
I am a U.S. citizen, and I will not be silenced!

617
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:33,250
我是一名美国公民  我不会保持缄默
I am a U.S. citizen, and I will not be silenced!

618
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:53,950
我受够你了  乔纳西
I'm sick of you, Jonesy!

619
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,340
我说到做到
Count on it.

620
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,760
我为那项工程累得半死不活
I worked my ass off on that project.

621
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,360
我为你骄傲
I'm very proud of you.

622
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:40,300
我喜欢你不代表我懦弱
Don't mistake my affection for you for weakness.

623
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,800
我现在不能做这个
I can't do this now.

624
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,430
我相信他们会的
I believe they will.

625
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:02,730
我想让你看看这个  这样你会明白
I wanted you to see this so you would understand.

626
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,280
我需要掌握任何信息
I need to know about any messages--

627
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,500
我要跟你说句话
I need a word.

628
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,390
我要和国防部长通话
I want to talk to the secretary of defense.

629
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,680
我要和科利通话
I want to speak to Curry.

630
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,160
我要接管这艘潜艇  长官
I'm taking control of this boat, sir.

631
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,240
我要拿回这艘潜艇  还给我的国家
I'm taking back this boat and returning it to my country,

632
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,050
-我要你约见... -已经安排好了  长官
- I want you to set up interviews with-- - Already done, sir.

633
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,840
我要寻求真相  你们也当如此
I want the truth, and you should, too!

634
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:36,310
我要寻求真相  你们也当如此
I want the truth, and you should, too!

635
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,530
我也不对贝类过敏
I'm not allergic to shellfish, either.

636
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,130
我一直都信任你
Always.

637
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:59,040
我一直清楚这点
I've always known that.

638
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:02,260
我一直在给你打电话
I've been trying to call you.

639
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,090
我以为我已经明确地表过态了
I thought my feelings on this subject were pretty clear,

640
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,010
我有话跟艇长说
I need to talk to the captain.

641
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,240
我有家事急需处理
I have family issues I need to attend to.

642
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,540
我原本服役3年期满光荣退伍 
I'm supposed to be on the downhill run of a 3-year enlistment,

643
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:32,560
我在想办法让真相大白
I am trying to bring the truth out into light.

644
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:30,870
我在指挥台  拿着手雷
I'm on the conn. I have a grenade.

645
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,530
我真幸运  我是不可或缺的
Lucky me. I'm indispensable.

646
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,510
我只会扳弯东西  不会打碎东西
I bend, I don't break.

647
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:16,530
我只能通过这种方式和你联络了
This is the only way I could get you a message.

648
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,480
我只是  真心觉得我得留在这
I just--I feel it in my heart that I have to stay

649
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:26,200
我只是担心他
I was worried about him--

650
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,900
我只是在执行命令
I was acting on orders.

651
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:21,140
我只想当一名海军
That's all I ever wanted.

652
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,470
我只想让你知道
Just so you know,

653
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,480
我只想再检查一下索具
I'm just double-checking the riggings.

654
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,750
我知道
I know.

655
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:56,730
我知道
I know.

656
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:54,560
我知道
I know.

657
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:52,930
我知道
Oui, je sais.

658
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:55,390
我知道我很爱国
I know, I know. I get patriotic.

659
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:10,590
我知道这很难  但你的朋友应该被安葬
I know it must be hard, but your friend deserves better.

660
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,440
我最后一次和你说话  所以...
I-I can get to you for a while, so there's...

661
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,840
我昨天收到的
I received it yesterday.

662
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,160
无线电信号  加密信息
radio signals, coded communications,

663
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:03,900
无疑是帮助他们反击的最佳人选
how to help them defeat it than the people who made it?

664
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,900
稀土矿物类的全球市场上
"...Global markets in rare earth minerals,

665
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:00,640
洗耳恭听
I'm listening.

666
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,580
系统把数据都传输回来了
it transmitted all that data back home

667
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,600
下次再需正当防卫时
Given a just cause,

668
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:24,040
下一秒却甚至连吃的都没了
and then the next you can't even eat.

669
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,170
现在  我向你保证
Now, I grant you,

670
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,450
现在华盛顿很多大人物都如坐针毡
There are a lot of nervous powerful people in Washington right now,

671
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,460
现在你们欠我的债  索菲
Now there is a debt, Sophie.

672
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,880
现在却闹成这样
and now all of this?

673
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,410
现在我有个朋友比你更需要那玩意儿
Now I got a friend that needs that joy juice more than you do.

674
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,580
想要击沉我们的就是自己人
Our own people just tried to kill us,

675
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,710
想坐就坐下吧
It's okay if you want to sit down.

676
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,310
向前进
Forward march.

677
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,160
向右转
Right face.

678
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:25,250
小时候我家搬到了一个环境很差的城市
When I was a kid, we moved to a pretty rough town.

679
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:37,450
小心枪
Gun!

680
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,190
小子  你再说一句  就跟我干一架吧
One more, and you're gonna have to throw with me, son.

681
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,070
谢帕德上尉  你接管指挥台
Lieutenant Shepard, you have the conn.

682
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,470
谢帕德上尉  你接管指挥台
Lieutenant Shepard, you have the conn.

683
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:16,820
谢谢  长官
Thank you, sir.

684
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:05,600
谢谢
Thanks.

685
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,340
信用卡被注销了  我没有任何积蓄
Credit cards were canceled. I have no savings.

686
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,470
兄弟  现在你要帮我理清这堆乱麻
Now, buddy, I need your help figuring out this mess.

687
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,740
需继续履行当前职责
will be required to continue executing their duties

688
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:20,960
需要送往医院
Needs a hospital.

689
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,920
需要我怎么做  长官
What do you want me to do... Sir?

690
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:09,570
选择离开者
"Those choosing to leave

691
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,150
演习的目的不是变得优秀
We don't drill to be good.

692
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,310
演习结束
Drill concluded.

693
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,570
样机上面装有
There's a gyroscopic positioning system

694
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,050
要求他支使我男朋友
had him get my boyfriend

695
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:24,220
也许艇长知道一些你不知道的情况
Maybe the captain is aware of something that you're not.

696
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,680
也许我的演讲该更好
Maybe if I'd made a better speech.

697
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,270
也要通过正常的行政管理流程
you will do so through the proper chain of command.

698
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,650
一个不落
All of you.

699
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,850
一个小时前就修理完毕了
Had this fixed an hour ago.

700
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,310
一号和二号鱼雷发射管  准备发射
tubes one and two, prepare to fire.

701
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:26,190
医院的工作人员都已经跑了
but most of the hospital staff have abandoned ship.

702
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,230
医院里没有吗啡了
Hospital's out of morphine.

703
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,960
已经和艇员们沟通过了
So we've talked it through the crew.

704
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:00,020
因此我才把名单张贴在 休息舱的舱面上
That's why there's a list... up on the mess decks.

705
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,590
因为如果总统要你去做某件事
Because when the president asks you to do something,

706
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,340
因为是我让他那样做的
Because I told him to.

707
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,690
因为我要执行命令
Because those were my orders.

708
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,440
赢得了最高呼声
across the country today.

709
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,510
尤其是在女兵们中间
especially with the female enlisted.

710
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:00,210
有本事当面说我是叛徒  你们这些骗子
Come out here and call me a traitor to my face, you liars!

711
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,570
有多人持武器与我对峙
There's an armed party on the conn,

712
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,330
有人收买了跟我上床的男人指使他偷走
Someone got the man that I was sleeping with

713
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,840
有人通知我明天在五角大楼
I've been asked to attend a meeting

714
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,110
有人洗劫了药品供给库
Someone raided the supply cabinet.

715
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,990
有什么事吗  布兰伦先生
Can I help you, Mr. Brannan?

716
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:49,250
有什么损失你们赔偿
You're paying for the damage.

717
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:24,800
有手榴弹
Grenade!

718
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,180
有谁单独和塞拉特相处过吗
So neither of you spent any time alone with Serrat?

719
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,080
有些事你必须知道
something you need to know.

720
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,560
有意思  继续关注他
That's interesting. Stay on him.

721
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,210
佑护你们行动成功
and bless this endeavor.

722
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:24,430
于是你就让一颗暴躁的定时炸弹在艇上
So you let a time bomb fester on my boat.

723
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,970
鱼雷舱  请报告进度
Torpedo room report.

724
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,750
鱼雷舱的堵漏问题已解决
Flooding in torpedo room is secure.

725
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,630
鱼雷舱的水位已控制到安全标准
Flooding in the torpedo room is secured.

726
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,510
鱼雷舱进水了
Flooding in the torpedo room.

727
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,560
鱼雷多久后接触我艇
Time to impact?

728
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,110
鱼雷将于五秒后撞击
Torpedo five seconds to impact.

729
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:30,730
与此同时
Meanwhile,

730
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,870
愿上帝让你们心中充满爱国热忱
May god fill you with patriot zeal,

731
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,000
约什  到底怎么了  告诉我
Josh, what's going on, man? Talk to me.

732
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,480
约什  放轻松  孩子
Josh, take it easy, son.

733
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,400
约什  我明白
Look, Josh, I get it.

734
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:08,190
约什  我知道你被俘的经历有如炼狱
Josh, I know you went through hell when you were captured.

735
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,040
约什  现在潜艇上有120条命
Josh, there are 120 souls on this boat right now.

736
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:13,120
约什选了瑞德
He picked Red.

737
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,440
再也不会了
Not again.

738
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,510
在"留下"那栏签名  男士们就能瞬间
up on your "Stay" list, all of a sudden

739
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,830
在那儿向海军当局投降
where you will surrender to naval authorities.

740
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,440
在全国范围内
...Met by mostly cheers

741
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,020
在早晨  当地的女孩们会下山来
In the morning, the local girls come down.

742
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,000
在知道他们的立场之前  不能让他们上艇
We can't have them on the boat until we know where they stand.

743
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,490
责任和忠诚让我们何去何从
What do duty and honor dictate we do?

744
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:19,960
怎么会这样
How does this happen?

745
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:03,700
-炸掉潜艇  -放下枪
- Blow it. Sink the boat. - Lower your weapons.

746
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,520
詹姆斯  霍普醒了
James. Hop's waking up.

747
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:28,200
战斗准备
Battle stations.

748
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,700
长官  请指示
Sir, what are my orders?

749
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,330
长官  是斯特恩・瑞德曼
It's Seaman Redman, sir.

750
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,070
长官  我要将潜艇带到封锁区
Sir, I'm taking the boat out to the blockade.

751
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,750
长官
Sir...

752
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,710
-找到水手长  -是 长官
- Find the C.O.B. - Aye, sir.

753
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,570
这不是正确选择
this is not the answer.

754
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,220
这才叫保卫你的国家
That is how you defend your nation.

755
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:52,730
这才是我的乖女儿
That's my girl.

756
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:44,370
这岛大得很  给我继续找
It's a big island. Keep looking!

757
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:00,400
这地方曾是流亡之地
This place was exile,

758
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,490
这个过程残酷无情
It's gonna be relentless and vicious.

759
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,130
这件事很难说谁对谁错
it's pretty damn hard to fathom what's right or wrong here,

760
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,690
这可不是我说的
You didn't hear it from me.

761
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,590
这里确实很有意思  但也是时候离开了
Hey, it's been fun, man, but it's time to go.

762
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:43,920
这里位置很好
It's a nice spot.

763
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,630
这里有些事情
There are things here

764
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,180
这里真的应该缝一针
This could really use a stitch.

765
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,370
这么敌对  真的
are that far apart, really.

766
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,400
这事你本可以在电话里跟我讲的
Look, you could have told me this on the phone.

767
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,500
这是给他妻子的  不是供你娱乐的
It's meant for his wife, not for your amusement.

768
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,290
这是什么时候发来的
When did this come through?

769
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,930
这无关乎去与留
It's not stay or go.

770
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,640
这些问题我已经回答了
Now I've answered those questions for myself,

771
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,800
针对艇长马库斯・查普林
in regards to criminal charges against captain Marcus Chaplin

772
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,210
真的  很美
Ah, it's just... spectacular.

773
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,440
-真是大胆之举啊  -是啊
- Pretty ballsy move. - Yes, it was.

774
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,640
整个事件你能接受了吗
You feeling better about all this?

775
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,000
政府拘押了我
The government detained me!

776
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,590
政府拘押了我
The government detained me!

777
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,490
只会得到一个回答  "船在哪儿
the only answer he's gonna get is, "Where's the boat

778
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,540
直到安全返美途径
"until such a time as safe transit back to the United States

779
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,190
直到能带他回家
until I can get him home.

780
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,470
直到枪响瑞德一直尖叫
Red was screaming right up until the gunshots.

781
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,160
直接开口要就行了啊
They could have asked.

782
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,670
指挥台  我是副艇长  无法堵漏
Conn, X.O. cannot secure flooding.

783
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,060
指挥台  鱼雷舱的堵漏问题已解决
Conn, torpedo room flooding has stopped,

784
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,730
至少不能让他们继续执勤了
A-at least let me take them off the duty roster.

785
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:34,080
中国在台湾海岸进行了海军演习
China conducted naval drills off the coast of Taiwan, which--

786
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:42,380
铸就了现在的我

787
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,420
准备迎接爆炸震荡
Prepare for impact.

788
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:14,800
准备应战
Get ready to fight.

789
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,410
自从诉讼提起后  来电从未间断
It's been ringing nonstop since the indictment.

790
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,780
棕色肌肤  比基尼上衣
Brown skin, bikini tops.

791
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,550
作为副艇长
I'm the X.O. Of this boat,

792
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,980
做好准备向他妈自己人开战吗

- Sam! Sam, is that you?  - It's me. I'm okay.

8
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,200
不管你听说了什么
Listen to me. I don't know what you've heard,

9
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,340
我都可以解释
but I can explain it all.

10
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,790
我得先安全回家
I just need to get home first.

11
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,210
马库斯・查普林已被认定为
Marcus Chaplin has been deemed

12
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,280
不适宜继续指挥  副艇长也一样
unfit for command, as has his X.O.

13
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,750
你们的政府现在已将他们视作敌对势力
Your government now considers them enemy combatants.

14
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,970
你们带着一名伤兵从巴基斯坦匆忙撤离
You guys bug out of Pakistan with a wounded man.

15
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,480
几小时之后美国就发动了核轰炸
And a few hours later the U.S. is nuking the joint?

16
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,820
你怎么看待这两件事间的联系
How do you connect the dots?

17
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,930
马库斯・查普林宣称  科罗拉多号收到的
Marcus Chaplin claims that the nuke order

18
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,290
核弹发射命令来自南极紧急通讯网
sent to the "Colorado" came through the Antarctic Network.

19
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,630
在这件事中  你有得天独厚的条件
You're uniquely qualified to do something about this.

20
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,320
得天独厚的条件  就是拿我自己的人头冒险
Uniquely qualified to risk my own ass

21
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,660
去救你的宝贝女儿是吧
to help you save your daughter?

22
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,700
你真觉得你能打破这份信仰吗
Really think you can break that kind of devotion?

23
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,040
她有信念  坠入了爱河
Well, she's got faith. She's in love.

24
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,160
但这些都是可矫正的
Those things are curable.

25
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,980
政府拘押了我
The government detained me!

26
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,360
特大新闻
海军叛徒之妻克里斯汀娜袭击媒体记者

27
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,410
他们对科罗拉多号上发生的事满口谎言
They are lying about what happened to the "Colorado"!

28
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:46,000
我是一名美国公民  我不会保持缄默
I am a U.S. citizen, and I will not be silenced!

29
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,050
煽动叛乱  叛国  恐怖主义
Sedition, treason, terrorism.

30
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,000
更别提你还偷了一艘美国战舰
Not to mention you stole a U.S. warship

31
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,350
向华府发射了一枚核弹
and fired a nuclear weapon to Washington D.C.

32
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,820
我是为了保护我的艇员
To prevent American b-1 bombers

33
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,170
不受美国B-1轰炸机袭击
from annihilating my crew,

34
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,340
-保护成千上万无辜的平民  -你现在是
- and thousands of innocent civilians! - You are currently

35
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,700
强制扣押141名艇员
holding 141 U.S. sailors against their will,

36
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,390
其中还有71名正式签名要求
71 of whom signed a list formally requesting

37
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,520
在此岛解除他们的职务
that they be relieved of their duties on this island.

38
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,400
科利不知道这件事
Curry doesn't know that.

39
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,330
他们都有家庭  有妻子
These men have families, sir. They have wives.

40
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:11,170
还有孩子
They have children.

41
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,850
军人家庭都明白...
Military families who knew precisely--

42
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:14,040
他们没想要参与这样的事
They didn't sign up for this!

43
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:16,830
现在我们还是在角色扮演吗
Are we still role-playing here?

44
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,750
模拟辩论是你的主意  如果不管用的话
The mock debate was your idea. If it's not useful...

45
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,920
很管用  好好想想
It is useful. Ask yourself,

46
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,420
为什么他们突然愿意谈判了
why the sudden willingness to negotiate?

47
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,860
中国大陆正对台湾剑拔弩张
China's rattling her sabers over Taiwan.

48
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,430
美国政府可不想因为我们
And our little distraction is the last thing

49
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,100
这边的事分心伤神
that this administration needs.

50
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:32,140
我们只有这一次机会扭转局势
We have one shot to get this right.

51
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,560
两小时后  你就要面对面
In two hours, you'll be face-to-face

52
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,090
和国防部长威廉・科利谈判
with Secretary of Defense William Curry,

53
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,150
此人非常奸诈狡猾
who happens to be an extremely cunning son of a bitch.

54
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,420
控制好你的情绪
Control your feelings,

55
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,530
否则科利会借此对付你
or I guarantee Curry will control them for you.

56
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,430
我的咖啡豆只够维持两周了
I only have beans for two more weeks.

57
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,960
所以你想跳楼的话
So if you're going to jump,

58
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,160
拜托请等我喝完那些咖啡
please wait until I finish my cafe.

59
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,630
不了  我不喝
No, I'm okay.

60
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,640
我明白  不用说了
I know. Don't say it.

61
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,200
我看起来像个卖冰淇淋的小商贩
I, uh, I look like an ice cream man.

62
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,620
我本来是想说 
I was going to say

63
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,640
或许别人对制服男的看法是对的
perhaps it's true what they say about a man in uniform.

64
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,120
有人要来造访了
Well, company's coming.

65
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,950
艇长想演场戏  所以...
Captain wants to put on a show, so...

66
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,670
我觉得这挺好的  双方以和谈的形式
I think this can only be good. You'll talk, they'll talk.

67
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:29,430
他们想要回潜艇  你们想回家
They want their submarine, you want to go home.

68
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,360
事情没那么简单
It's not that simple.

69
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,740
打扰  长官
Excuse me, sir.

70
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,710
女士  我想你应该下来看看
Ma'am, I think you should come down here.

71
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,940
你在这儿真是太好了
I'm glad you're here.

72
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,850
貌似我们有大麻烦了
We seem to have a bit of a catastrophic problem.

73
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,750
你不是说我们的咖啡喝完了吗
I thought you said we're out of coffee.

74
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,280
什么事
What is it?

75
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,850
31阵列出问题了
Array 31 pegged out

76
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,450
北部边界一半瘫痪
and took down half the northern perimeter.

77
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,160
什么意思  他在说什么
What does that mean? What's he talking about?

78
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,620
看到绿点组成的弧线了吗
You see that string of green lights?

79
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,660
那是我们的声纳阵列
That's our sonar array line.

80
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,080
主要防止潜艇偷袭
It keeps submarines from sneaking up and killing you.

81
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,320
-看到断掉的那段了吗  -看到了
- Now, you see that part that's off?  - Yeah.

82
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,450
也就是说那部分  关闭了
That means that part is, uh, you know, off.

83
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:00,480
我是副艇长
This is the X.O.

84
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,720
紧急集合  准备战斗
Man battle stations. Man battle stations.

85
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,270
26英里处42射击点可能有敌人入侵
Possible enemy contact 26 miles from range point 42--

86
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,850
那不是袭击
It's not an attack.

87
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,860
稍等  待命
Hold that order. Stand by.

88
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,730
你说什么
Excuse me?

89
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,570
上个月阵列就该换电池了
The array was supposed to have its battery serviced last month.

90
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,620
是因为没电了  你在开玩笑吗
I-it's a dead battery? Are you kidding me?

91
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,660
你们需要多久能换好
How long will it take for you to fix?

92
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,310
阵列在水下300英尺处
The array's 300 feet below the surface, man.

93
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,790
不归我们换
We don't fix it.

94
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:22,810
那是谁换
Who fixes it?

95
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,540
美国海军
The United States navy.

96
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,510
需要我给你电话号码吗
Should I get you the number?

97
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,570
我要和艇长去谈判
I'm gonna be with the captain in negotiations.

98
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,140
你来接管科罗拉多号
So you're gonna take the "Colorado"

99
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,430
还有一个分遣队
and a small detachment.

100
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,410
需要潜水员  工程师 
Diver, engineering,

101
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,090
-声纳  无线电  -是  长官
- sonar, weps--  - Yes, sir.

102
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,650
我们完全有理由认为
Listen, we have every reason to believe

103
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:40,980
只是电池没电了
that this is just a dead battery.

104
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,700
但是刚巧是和科利一行前来的同一天
But the same day that Curry and his entourage arrive,

105
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,410
所以我们不排除其他可能
we can't rule anything out.

106
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,600
准备好第一次指挥了吗
So, you ready for your first command?

107
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,160
准备好了  不会让你失望的  长官
Aye, aye. Won't let you down, sir.

108
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,280
我知道  解散
I know you won't. Dismissed.

109
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,130
终于让你自己真枪实战了
Daddy finally let you take the car out of the driveway?

110
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,500
别担心  长官
Don't worry, sir.

111
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,850
我会帮忙看着她的
I'll keep her out of trouble.

112
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,830
-他在哪里  -詹姆斯吗
- So where is he?  - James?

113
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,620
我又不是他的保姆
I'm not his keeper.

114
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,790
帮我给金士官带个话
Well, maybe you could get Petty Officer King a message for me.

115
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,070
一个边界水下声纳阵列出故障了
A critical underwater sonar array has failed.

116
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,520
我的任务是带领人去维修
And I'm tasked with leading the repair operation.

117
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,920
所以我需要一名优秀的潜水员
So I need a diver-- a good one.

118
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,670
要接受过水肺潜水训练的
One who's trained in trimix--

119
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,230
你需要记下来吗
Do you want to write this down?

120
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,200
好吧  他队内两名海豹突击队员
Fine. Two of the S.E.A.L.S in his unit,

121
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,750
费舍和沃格勒都有深水独潜资格
Fisher and Vogler, are certified deep solo.

122
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,440
我需要詹姆斯告诉我谁更优秀
I need James to tell me which one's best.

123
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,980
-你开玩笑吧  -看  找到他了
- You are joking, right? - Oh, look, I found him.

124
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,950
沃格勒都没下过250英尺
Vogler's never been below 250.

125
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,000
那么就是费舍
So Fisher it is, then.

126
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,300
-你没必要这么做  -非做不可
- You don't have to do this. - But I do.

127
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,230
如果美国海军知道声纳阵列出了问题
If the U.S. Navy finds out the array line's down,

128
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,830
会派50个你这样的家伙
They'll drop 50 guys just like you

129
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,680
趁我们熟睡时敲破我们的脑壳
to double-tap our skulls while we sleep, so--

130
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,930
你需要潜水员
You need a diver.

131
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,690
-我就是  -你自告奋勇
- I'm a diver. - You volunteering?

132
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,180
我以为你不管他们的事了  詹姆斯
I thought you were done with these people, James.

133
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,660
8点整出发  带好装备
We leave 0800. Get your gear.

134
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,190
知道吗  海豹突击队的人就是这样
You know, that's the thing with these S.E.A.L. boys.

135
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,300
为了刺激什么都敢做
They'll do just about anything for a thrill.

136
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,590
正是科利
That's Curry, all right.

137
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,640
12名带M4的宪兵
Looks like we got 12 M.P.s with M4s.

138
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,110
长官  你一定不敢相信
Sir, you're not gonna believe this.

139
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,590
白宫顾问阿曼达・斯昭
White House adviser Amanda Straugh.

140
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,630
很好  看来我们得到了总统的高度关注
Good. It seems we have the president's full attention.

141
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,140
不  看左边
No. Pan left.

142
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,920
格蕾丝的父亲跟来搞什么名堂
What the hell is Grace's father doing here?

143
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,450
他们以为我是钟楼里的持枪歹徒
Oh, they think they're dealing with a gunman in a bell tower.

144
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,980
带位老友来劝降
They brought an old friend to talk me down.

145
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,620
你们大家都忧心忡忡  挂念家人
There's not a man among you who's not worried about his family,

146
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,200
不知事件如何收场
and how this is all gonna end.

147
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,840
我对你们的命令很简单
My orders to you are simple.

148
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,090
不要
Don't.

149
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,530
不要让这些人看到你们的疑虑
Don't show these people your doubt.

150
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,480
惟有团结一心  我们才有力量
We are only as strong as we are unified,

151
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,850
惟有不露声色  才能一致对外
and only as unified as we appear to be.

152
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,570
让他们看到我们的决心
Show these people our resolve,

153
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,180
今天我们大家就有回家的机会
and there's a chance for all of us to go home today.

154
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,410
你们都听到了  列队
You heard the man! Fall in!

155
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,440
我带来你们总统的口信
I bring a message from your president.

156
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,060
任何不愿继续参与
Any person who no longer wishes to be a party

157
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,310
这场叛国行径者
to this treasonous act,

158
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:28,990
现在出列
step forward now.

159
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,470
我们会保护你
We will protect you.

160
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,780
很好
Very well!

161
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,010
是你们自取灭亡
So shall you hang.

162
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,800
上将
Admiral.

163
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,670
马库斯在哪儿
Where's Marcus?

164
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,790
他正等着你们
He's waiting.

165
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,890
格蕾丝很好  长官
Grace is fine, sir.

166
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,560
抱歉  我们没想到你会来
I'm sorry. We didn't expect you to be here.

167
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,040
她正在潜艇上
She's currently embarked on the sub.

168
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,220
谁负责指挥
Who's in command?

169
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,050
情况汇报  水手长  
Sit-rep, Master Chief.

170
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,250
我有疑问  长官
Interrogative, ma'am.

171
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,150
我的潜艇上为什么会有法国妞
Why is there a French girl on my boat?

172
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,550
她对此次任务至关重要
She's vital to the mission.

173
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,720
莫非我们打算撤退
Are we planning a retreat?

174
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,700
-有没有情况汇报  -有  长官
- Do you have a report or not? - Yes, ma'am.

175
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,220
水手长报告  他从前划独木舟上也比这人手多
C.O.B. reports that he's crewed canoes with more men than this.

176
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,850
现在是通讯官在负责导航
We've got our communications officer piloting the boat.

177
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,940
6个非专业人员兼顾武器和机械
We have six non-quals spread in between weapons and engineering.

178
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,340
或许能够勉强航行  或者作战
Maybe we can run, maybe we can fight,

179
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,880
但是想要边跑边打  却比登天还难
but we sure as shinola cannot run and fight.

180
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,560
谢谢  水手长  没事了
Thank you, Master Chief. That'll be all.

181
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,440
希望你们有带浮圈
Hope you folks brought your water wings.

182
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,220
没别的事了 水手长
That will be all, C.O.B.

183
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:31,670
格蕾丝  就算你在指挥台上站到审判日
Grace, you can stand on that conn till the rapture comes.

184
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,230
你仍旧不会是我的艇长
Still don't make you my captain.

185
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,420
凯希尔先生  深度310英尺
Mr. Cahill, make your depth 3-1-0 feet,

186
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,800
俯角10度  注意空泡
10 degree down angle. And watch your cavitation.

187
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,730
栅栏倒了  可能有不速之客
The fence is down. We may have uninvited guests.

188
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,270
俯角10度  收到
10 degree down angle, aye.

189
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,670
正在通过海沟  长官
Passing the trench now, sir.

190
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,010
我是说  女长官
I mean, ma'am.

191
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,700
都可以的  凯希尔先生 
Either will do, Mr. Cahill.

192
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,310
你认为你们能坚持多久  马库斯
How long do you expect to hold out here, Marcus?

193
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,150
一个月  两个月  四个月
A month? Two? Four?

194
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,190
当然  你的队伍正在减员
Of course, you're losing people left and right.

195
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,190
多久之后  余下的下伙子们会不再听你指挥
How long before the rest of these boys turn on you,

196
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,760
反戈哗变
break out the piano wire?

197
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,140
他们会的  等雨季一来
Because they will. After the monsoons.

198
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:09,030
遍地洪水  闹起饥荒
Fields flood, starvation starts.

199
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,550
你到底是不是带着解决方案来和谈的
Did you come with an offer or not?

200
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,390
和谈  我是来处理麻烦的
An offer? I came to clean up a mess.

201
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,260
你们朝自己祖国的首都发射一枚核弹
You launched a nuclear missile at your own country.

202
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:18,350
你们未经宣战就向巴基斯坦发射了两枚
You detonated two in Pakistan without a declaration of war.

203
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,720
你们把战斧导弹射向己方...
You fired a Tomahawk missile at your own--

204
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,900
违抗直接命令的叛变潜艇  没错
At a rogue submarine in contravention of direct orders, yes.

205
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,260
非法  未经确认的直接命令
Direct, unlawful, unconfirmed orders.

206
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,330
我确认过
I confirmed them!

207
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,630
我说的是权威人物的确认
I meant by somebody with authority.

208
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,130
别跟我谈你古怪的是非观
Do not talk to me about your quaint ideas of right and wrong.

209
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,750
我们来这里不是因为你们的原则  小子
We are not here because of your principles, son.

210
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,600
我们来  是因为你们的渎职
We are here because of your failure--

211
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,890
你们未能履行职责  执行命令
to do your duty, to follow orders,

212
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,880
没做到转动钥匙按下按钮这样简单的事
to simply turn a key and press a button.

213
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,050
天呐  找对黑猩猩都比你们俩更能胜任
My God, a pair of chimpanzees could do what you conot.

214
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,660
你要我的解决方案
You want my offer?

215
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,130
我的解决方案就是
My offer is this--

216
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,820
叛国罪
treason.

217
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,410
山姆・肯德尔  马库斯・查普林
Sam Kendal, Marcus Chaplin,

218
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,320
格蕾丝・谢帕德
Grace Shepard,

219
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,810
及当日指挥台上所有军官
and all officers present on the conn that day

220
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,660
将接受军事法庭审判
will appear before a military tribunal.

221
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,920
我的艇员呢
What about my crew?

222
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,050
联邦监狱服刑7年
Seven years each in a federal penitentiary.

223
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,290
不得假释
No parole.

224
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:10,350
我们愿意放弃死刑制裁
Now, we are willing to forego the death penalty

225
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,860
因为考虑到 
in light of the circumstance

226
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,290
查普林艇长之子杰弗里不幸阵亡
regarding the unfortunate death of captain Chaplin's son Jeffrey.

227
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,300
你想要我死  想封住我的嘴
You want me dead, you want to silence me,

228
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,500
想杀光我的船员
you want to kill my crew?

229
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,550
你有过机会  王八蛋  你错过了
You had your shot, you son of a bitch! You missed!

230
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,220
你看清楚了  我不是政客
Look closely. I am not a politician.

231
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,860
你敢再提我儿的名字
If you say my son's name again,

232
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,130
我发誓  我就把你的眼珠子打出来
I swear I will crush the jelly from your eyes.

233
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,730
好了  冷静  冷静
Okay. Easy, easy, easy.

234
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:31,750
冷静点
Easy!

235
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,300
别激动
Easy.

236
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,880
把枪放下  没事了
Get them down. We're okay.

237
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,760
没事了  没事了
We're okay. We're okay.

238
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,050
没事了
We're okay.

239
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,170
他的情绪不对  山姆
He's not well, Sam.

240
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,140
你还有很多值得珍惜的东西
You still have something to live for.

241
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:54,210
别把希望都寄托在一无所有的人身上
Don't tie it all to a man with nothing to lose.

242
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,410
你不是说应该"不动声色"吗
What the hell happened to "Show no emotion"?

243
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,720
你打破了自己制定的规则  我想...
You're breaking your own rules, sir. I'd like--

244
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,780
长官
Sir!

245
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,060
他惹怒我了
He pissed me off.

246
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:14,680
他惹怒你了
He pissed you off?

247
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,820
可现在他是唯一一位
That is the one man right now

248
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,720
有权力送我们回家的人
who has the power to send us all back home!

249
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,510
是送我们进监狱
To send us to prison.

250
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,850
这是在谈判
It's a negotiation!

251
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,580
双方各退一步  达成妥协
We give a little, they give a little.

252
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,340
-我知道怎么谈判  -真的吗
- I know how it works. - Really?

253
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,470
因为你刚才的表现  实在是太...
'Cause the man I saw in there seemed completely--

254
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,790
继续说  说出来
Go on. Say it.

255
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:33,540
长官  服五年  六年徒刑  我都能接受
I could do five years, sir. I could do six.

256
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,350
-闭嘴  -只要能让我们回家
- Stop it! - If it gets us back home,

257
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,420
只要不再有人员伤亡  我就愿意服刑
and no more people die, I could do it!

258
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,590
那就是你想要的结局吗
Is that how you want this to end?

259
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,600
不是想要  是除此之外别无他法
It's not what I want, it's what I can get.

260
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,830
谁曾经那样教过我
Who taught me that?

261
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,910
我还教过你  荣誉高于一切
And what did I teach you about honor?

262
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,860
你知道只要你开口  我定会至死忠随
You know I will follow you all the way down if you ask.

263
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:52,410
可是长官  你别指望他们向你道歉
But the apology you want is not coming, sir.

264
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,120
他们是代表美国政府来交涉的
That is the United States of America in there!

265
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,370
而美国政府从不道歉
And they do not apologize!

266
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,420
一定要时刻注意你的氧气剩余量
Pay close attention to your air reserves.

267
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,790
注意好绳索
And watch the tether.

268
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,480
那是我们唯一的纽带
It's our only communication.

269
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,500
如果绳索被切断  一定要保持深度
If you lose the tether, maintain your depth.

270
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,480
因为如果任凭水流带你上浮得过快...
If the current drags you up too quickly--

271
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,160
我就会被压扁  关节会炸开
I get bent. My joints explode.

272
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,600
脑子里全是血栓  我见过那种惨状
My brain embolizes. I've seen it.

273
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,040
我又不是第一次参加牛仔竞技了
This isn't my first rodeo, okay?

274
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,060
孩子  她恐怕不知道牛仔竞技为何物吧
She don't know what a rodeo is, kid.

275
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,980
-法国也会举办牛仔竞技啊  -不可能
- Oh, we have rodeo in France. - Nah.

276
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,550
真的  牛马满场奔腾  牛仔精彩献艺
Oui. Horses, cows, cowboys.

277
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,630
法国根本没有牛仔  女士
There's no such thing as a French cowboy, lady.

278
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,390
法国人就是牛仔的反义词
French is the opposite of cowboy.

279
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,930
牛仔是像威尔・罗杰斯
Cowboy is like Will Rogers,

280
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:43,370
约翰・韦恩和克林特・伊斯特伍德那样的真汉子
John Wayne, Clint Eastwood.

281
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:43,370
三人均为美国演员  以饰演牛仔而闻名

282
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,290
罗伯特・杜瓦尔也算吧
Robert Duvall?

283
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,290
美国演员  以饰演牛仔而闻名

284
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,380
你终于明白我的意思了
Now you're getting it.

285
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,500
杜瓦尔是法国人
Duvall is French.

286
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,510
收回你刚才的话
You take that back.

287
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,240
我们要到达声呐阵列处了
We're coming up on the array now.

288
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,840
每个人都要保持警觉  坚守岗...
I want everyone sharp, at their stat--

289
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,690
你不是要用这把电钻吧
Tell me that's not the drill you're using.

290
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:54,620
是啊
Yes.

291
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,230
那可是把手提钻
It looks like a jackhammer.

292
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,660
电池外壳上的螺栓足有10英寸长
The bolts in the battery casing are 10 inches long.

293
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,760
不行  给他找把扳手来  水手长
No. Get him a wrench, C.O.B.

294
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,440
要是用扳手  没等我拧下第一枚螺钉
A wrench? I'll suck down my first tank

295
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,680
我的第一瓶氧气就该耗光了
before I pull the first screw.

296
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,990
你只要在海里启动电钻  10英里内的潜艇
You rev that thing out there, and any sub within 10 miles

297
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,630
就会向我艇发射MK48鱼雷
is gonna put a Mark-48 torpedo in our ear hole,

298
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,750
造成艇毁人亡的后果
and we'll all be dead.

299
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,140
为什么没有事先请示我
Why wasn't I told about this?

300
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,410
查验执行任务所需的装备是艇长的工作
It's the job of the captain to review all the mission assets.

301
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,890
我在半小时前刚接任了代理艇长一职
I was assigned this mission half an hour ago.

302
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,810
好吧  就用电钻  但动作要快
Fine. Use the drill, but make it quick.

303
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,320
什么
What?

304
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,430
你得好好考虑清楚  上尉
You need to think this through, Lieutenant.

305
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,210
你这么刚愎自用
You let your ego drive the boat,

306
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,770
会把我们害死的
people will get dead.

307
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,830
你之前答应过我格蕾丝不会
You said Grace wouldn't be charged

308
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,220
与马库斯和山姆一起遭到起诉
along with Marcus and Sam.

309
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,410
我们会为你女儿减刑
And we'll reduce the charges against your daughter

310
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:41,240
前提是你说服艇长接受我们的条件
when you convince the captain to accept our terms.

311
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,110
我与马库斯相识已有30年之久了
I've known Marcus for 30 years.

312
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,790
他是个坚持原则的人
He will stand on principle.

313
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,320
无论我说什么  都无法改变那一点
Nothing I can say is going to change that.

314
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,870
伊利诺斯号的巴特勒艇长向我报告说
I have a message from Captain Butler of the "Illinois".

315
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,620
他发现对方的的声纳阵列有个缺口
He believes he's found a gap in their sonar array line.

316
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,220
他还需多久就能定位并击沉科罗拉多号呢
How long before he finds the "Colorado" and sinks her?

317
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,190
那艘潜艇上可都是美国的水手
Those are American sailors on that submarine.

318
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,820
有人则认为他们是一群罪犯
Some say they're criminals.

319
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,730
虽然我并不愿意下达发射命令
Now I won't enjoy giving the fire order,

320
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,590
但若到了紧要关头  我不得不发
but when the time comes, I will give it,

321
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,680
换成你  也会这样做
just as you would.

322
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,270
好好劝劝你的朋友  让他妥协吧
So convince your friend to settle.

323
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,880
我到达声纳阵列了
All right, I'm on the array.

324
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,180
很好  系好绳索
Good. Secure the tether.

325
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,800
我要开始计时了
I'm starting the clock.

326
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,590
预计空气余量

327
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,660
能见度100英尺  看不到艇体
Vis 100 feet. Can't see the boat.

328
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,400
我们就在你的正下方  詹姆斯
We're right below you, James.

329
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,610
开始修理吧
Proceed with repair.

330
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,800
先取出电池外壳上的螺栓
First remove the bolts from the battery casing.

331
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,880
该死  谁听见了
Damn it. Who heard that?

332
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,670
谁都能听见  长官
Who didn't, ma'am?

333
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,600
噪音已传遍
We have noise propagation

334
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,650
温跃层上下15英里的区域
above and below the thermal for 15 miles.

335
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,000
全体注意  好戏开场了  我们成了活靶子
All right, people, it's a party, and we just became the pinata.

336
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,570
金士官  请用你最快的速度完成
Petty Officer King, as fast as you can, please.

337
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,630
-是  长官  -你是想害死我们吗
- Aye, ma'ma. - Are you trying to get us killed?

338
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,740
难以置信
Unbelievable.

339
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,080
肯德尔先生说你们有条件要提
Mr. Kendal says you have an offer?

340
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,150
我和我手下的军官要上法庭
I want a trial for me and my officers.

341
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,180
你们肯定会被送上军事法庭秘密审理的
Secret court-martial can certainly be arranged.

342
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,590
你误会了
You misunderstand.

343
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,190
我要求在民事法庭公开审理
I demand a public trial in a civilian court

344
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,330
全程录像  陪审员列席
cameras, jury,

345
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,050
并且赦免我手下的全体艇员
amnesty for my enlisted men.

346
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,290
我看你真的是疯了
You really have lost your mind.

347
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,650
你还说他是认真的  肯德尔
Y-you said he was serious, Kendal.

348
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,260
除非你们先答应这些条件
And only after you've agreed to those terms

349
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,150
我们才愿意商谈在巴基斯坦海岸
will we discuss the six

350
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,280
搭载那六名海豹突击队员的事
navy S.E.A.L.S I picked up off the coast of Pakistan.

351
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,960
一定是这海边空气的原因
Must be all this ocean air.

352
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,290
让我感觉非常饿
I'm famished.

353
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,750
我们先暂停去吃个午饭吧
Shall we break for lunch?

354
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,430
疯子以为这是场游戏
Lunatic thinks this is a game.

355
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,200
伊利诺斯号已经穿越了边界
The "Illinois" is through the perimeter.

356
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,410
两艘688i潜艇归航
Two 688i's inbound.

357
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:41,090
追捕到它
Hunt her down.

358
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,820
你一找到那艘潜艇  就立刻通知我
I want to know the moment you find that sub.

359
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,930
詹姆斯  检查一下水压
James, check your pressure.

360
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,520
收到  再拆一个螺栓
Copy that. One more bolt.

361
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,700
詹姆斯  你得加快速度了
James, you need to hurry.

362
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,500
或许他们没听到
Maybe they didn't hear it.

363
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,780
或许他们在另一片区域
Maybe they're in another sector

364
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,310
没有...
and they didn't--

365
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,520
发现新目标  2艘688潜艇  
New contact--2 688-class subs

366
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:03,540
方位0-7-1度
bearing 0-7-1,

367
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,000
距离16000码
range 16,000 yards.

368
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,850
16000码  还很远
16k? They're too far away.

369
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,460
运气好一点
With a little luck,

370
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,910
我们很快就可以撤退...
we'll be outhere before they fi--

371
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,350
发现新目标  弗吉尼亚级
New contact-- Virginia Class.

372
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,500
我们的挡音区声纳有反应  长官
Much have come out of our baffles, ma'am.

373
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,710
是伊利诺斯号  已经很近了
It's the "Illinois." She's close.

374
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:15,930
你必须命令下潜了  上尉
You gotta dive the boat, lieutenant.

375
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,580
不  他还在外面呢
No! He's still outside!

376
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,340
探测到主动声纳  它在搜寻我们
Active sonar. She's looking for us.

377
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,350
立刻下潜
Dive the boat now.

378
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,920
安静  我知道自己在干什么
Quiet! I know what I'm doing.

379
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,330
如果我们下潜  他必死无疑
He's dead if we dive!

380
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,300
目标正在靠近  航向1-4-9度
Contact coming about. Heading 1-4-9.

381
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,550
格蕾丝
Grace.

382
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,740
舵手  左满舵  紧急下潜
Helm, left full rudder! Emergency deep!

383
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,240
下潜吧  凯希尔先生
Take us down, Mr. Cahill.

384
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,980
詹姆斯  切断绳索  詹姆斯
James, cut the tether. James?

385
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,090
收到请回复  切断绳索
Do you copy? Cut the tether.

386
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,790
什么  不  没有绳索我就完了
What? No. I'm screwed without the tether.

387
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,000
别那么做
Don't do it!

388
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,260
不要
No!

389
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,530
超过测试深度
Passing test depth.

390
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,260
等等  他切断绳子了吗
Wait. Did he cut loose?

391
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,760
我们目前在1400英尺海下  索菲
We're at 1,400 feet, Sophie.

392
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,640
如果他还连着  就必死无疑  安静点
If he's attached, he's dead. Now be quiet.

393
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:16,330
凯希尔先生  在1500英尺深度停下
Mr. Cahill, all stop 1500 feet.

394
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:17,340
让潜艇悬游待命
Hover the ship.

395
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,610
我们在水中制造出一个空洞吧
Let's make like a hole in the water.

396
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,700
长官  我侦测到两个  是三个目标
Ma'am, I'm tracking two-- make that three contacts

397
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,320
在交错深度频繁发射脉冲
pinging actively at staggered depth.

398
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,890
搜寻模式  他们已覆盖我们所在范围了
Search pattern. They got us covered.

399
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,400
现在我们若移动  只有死路一条
We move now, we die.

400
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,100
半个中东都在进行武装斗争
Half the Middle East is up in arms.

401
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,110
在巴林  阿曼  阿联酋都出现暴乱
Riots in Bahrain, Oman, U.A.E.

402
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,320
中国海军在台湾岛附近聚集
China's navy is amassing around Taiwan.

403
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,680
而我的语音信箱里全是那些议员们
And my voicemail is full of congressmen

404
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,290
在抱怨8美元的气价
bitching about $8 gas.

405
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,270
或许下次你们再用核武器攻击别国前
Maybe next time you guys nuke a country,

406
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:44,960
该三思一下
you'll think it through.

407
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,140
木已成舟
Well, it happened.

408
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,820
现在重任压在你我这样的人身上
And now it's up to people like you and me--

409
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,200
负责任的人
responsible people.

410
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,350
你想怎么样
What do you want?

411
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,740
马库斯・查普林的妻子死于癌症
Marcus Chaplin's wife died of cancer.

412
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,960
一个儿子在阿富汗阵亡
One son K.I.A. in Afghanistan,

413
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,770
另一个儿子跑去拯救鲸鱼了
the other son ran off to save the whales.

414
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,910
已经多年没跟马库斯说过话了
Hasn't talked to Marcus in years.

415
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:03,830
当一个男人失去一切  剩下的就只有目标了
When a man loses everything, all he has left is his cause.

416
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,660
你自问一下
So ask yourself--

417
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,700
他的目标  依然和你的一样吗
Is his cause still the same as yours?

418
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,680
里面再见了
I'll see you inside.

419
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,020
山姆  我是来达成协议的  那就是我的工作
Look, I make deals, Sam. That's all I do.

420
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:18,370
而我见到的那个男人  他根本不想合作
And the man I see-- I can tell you he doesn't want one.

421
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,130
他只想殉难
What he wants is martyrdom.

422
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,850
仔细观察他  你也会发现的
Watch him. You'll see.

423
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,360
我从没想过我们会用上那些武器
Oh, I-I never thought we'd use those weapons.

424
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,690
不会再用了
Not again.

425
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,530
现在已经用了  我却连原因都不清楚
Now that we have, I don't even know why.

426
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,170
两天前  有81个国家
Two days ago, 81 countries moved for

427
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:40,980
在联合国大会上对美国发起了正式谴责
a formal condemnation of the United States on the floor of the U.N.

428
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,100
在华盛顿  几乎有一半的前参谋长
In D.C., I have almost half of the former joint chiefs

429
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,500
打算强行让总统下台
ready to forcibly remove this president.

430
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,840
他们都指望着你  坚守住这个岛
And they're all counting on you to hold fast on this island

431
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,310
等待合适的时机
until the time is right.

432
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,910
成为他们所编故事中格格不入的一环
To be part of the story that doesn't fit--

433
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,270
活生生的谎言的象征
the living, breathing symbol of the lie.

434
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,870
我曾经想过成为各种人  亚瑟
I've wanted to be a lot of things, Arthur,

435
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,330
却从未想过成为一个象征
but a symbol was never one of them.

436
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:06,490
是吗  但命运使然  
Oh, yeah? Well, we don't get to

437
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,910
我们也无能为力  不是吗
choose our fate, do we?

438
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,830
如果我今天有机会带着我的艇员们回家
If I have a chance to bring my people home today,

439
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,510
我可能会欣然接受
I may have to take it.

440
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:15,460
我也想要我的女儿回家  马库斯  真的
Yeah, well, I want my daughter home, Marcus. I do.

441
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,700
但我不知道我们的国家将会变成什么样
But I don't know what that home is becoming.

442
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,310
不  我不需要预约
No, I don't need a reservation.

443
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,190
那一直都是我的桌子  就那张
That's my table always, right there.

444
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,870
那张桌已经有人预约了
That table's reserved.

445
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,550
我知道有人预约了  就是留给我的
I know it's reserved. It's reserved for me.

446
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,300
我想跟罗格里奥谈谈
I would like to speak with Rogelio.

447
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,660
我在这儿等着
I'll wait.

448
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:34,690
失陪了
Excuse me.

449
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,140
你跟我上床
So you sleep with me,

450
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,600
然后趁我洗澡时  偷走了我的硬盘
and then you steal my hard drive while I'm in the shower.

451
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,080
那意味着你"搞"了我两次啊
That makes two times you screwed me,

452
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,770
我现在仍难以判断  哪个更让人失望
and I'm still not sure which was more disappointing.

453
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,530
-嗨  米米  -嗨  凯莉
- Hi, Mimi. - Kylie. Hi.

454
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:55,390
去补点粉吧
Catch a powder,

455
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,400
不然我让你永远无法出席全城各种社交活动
or I'll erase you off every guest list in the city.

456
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,130
米米・凡德霍特
Mimi Vanderholt?

457
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,800
那包挂在她身上都嫌掉价
The girl is an accessory to her own handbag.

458
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,900
你就是不知道什么时候该闭嘴  是吧
You just don't know when to stop, do you?

459
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,520
你让事情回到正轨我就罢休
I'll stop when you make this right.

460
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,280
帮我拿回我的数据
Help me get my data back.

461
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,170
你就不能跟其他人一样顺从合作吗
Why can't you just play along like everyone else?

462
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:13,380
因为其他人都是
Because it turns out everyone else

463
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,660
卑鄙的伪君子
is a backstabbing hypocrite.

464
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,370
你原先也一样卑鄙和虚伪
You were a backstabbing hypocrite.

465
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,020
我就喜欢你那一点
I liked that about you.

466
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:19,810
怎么变了
What happened?

467
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,620
太晚了  你已经出局
It's too late. You're out.

468
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,870
你已经变得和我们不一样了
You just went from being us to being them.

469
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:24,760
我会想你的
I'm gonna miss you.

470
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:26,320
不好意思
Excuse me?

471
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,990
把你的手拿开
Get your hands off me.

472
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,010
能跟我离开吗  女士
Could you come with me, ma'am?

473
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:32,920
现在就走
Now.

474
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:41,820
这边请
This way.

475
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,820
他们对科罗拉多号上发生的事满口谎言
They're lying about what happened to the "Colorado"!

476
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:50,440
我是一名美国公民  我不会保持缄默
I am a u.S. Citizen, and I will not be silenced!

477
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,880
我要寻求真相  你们也当如此
I want the truth, and you should, too!

478
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,610
潜艇军官夫人狂怒

479
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,120
怎么一直播这疯女人的视频
They ever gonna stop showing this nut job?

480
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,350
你们为什么不报道他们
Why aren't you reporting about them, huh?

481
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,000
政府拘押了我
The government detained me!

482
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,340
他们满口谎言...
They are lying about--

483
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,860
没完没了  对吧
It's never gonna stop, is it?

484
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:05,740
对
No.

485
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,480
这才是痛苦之处
That's what makes it so hard.

486
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,110
我理解你的感受  发现所爱之人
I know what it's like to find out the person we love

487
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,530
并不像你所想的那样
isn't who we thought they were.

488
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:19,290
这是什么
What is this?

489
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,840
这什么意思  "潜在买家"
What does this mean, "potential buyer"?

490
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,790
政府掌握了山姆和马库斯・查普林之间
The government has 32 e-mails that are encrypted

491
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,570
32封加密邮件往来
between Sam and Marcus Chaplin,

492
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,190
详述了他们向中国叛变
detailing their plan to defect to China

493
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,560
并卖掉科罗拉多号的计划
and sell the "Colorado."

494
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,520
不可能  山姆绝不会
That's insane. Sam would never do--

495
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,970
不知不觉中我们会失去很多人
We can lose somebody and never know.

496
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,360
他们离开  然后回来
They go away, they come back,

497
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,610
但内心有一部分却再也回不来
some part of them doesn't return.

498
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,010
他们会保守的一些秘密
Some part that they kept secret,

499
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,320
-绝口不言  直到...  -够了
- maybe even to themselves, until the moment-- - Stop.

500
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,610
够了  别说了
Please just... Just stop.

501
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,930
山姆之前从朝鲜回来后
Sam was different when he came home

502
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:48,000
就不一样了  不是吗
from North Korea, wasn't he?

503
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,380
小时候经常这么玩
Used to do this when I was a kid.

504
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,150
恐怖角  我爸爸脾气不好
Cape fear. My daddy was a crab man.

505
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,160
难以相信
I find that hard to believe.

506
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,190
哪一点  是说我出身平凡吗
What, that I come from humble folk?

507
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,530
是你曾是个孩子
That you were ever a child.

508
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,800
你不像你表现出来的那么讨厌我
You know, I think you like me more than you let on.

509
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,370
不是吗  我还挺喜欢你的
No? Well, I like you.

510
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,790
甚至我心里还有点敬佩
I think some part of me even admires

511
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,830
敬佩你想做的事
what you're trying to do here.

512
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,770
在世界上开辟出自己的一片领地
Carving out your own little piece of the world.

513
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:25,870
这是你想要的吗
Is that what you want?

514
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,810
因为我可以满足你
'Cause I could give that to you.

515
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:28,880
你知道我想要什么
You know what I want.

516
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,200
老天  你还真固执
God, you're a stubborn man.

517
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,450
你就想上法庭
You want your day in court.

518
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,880
你知道那边现在什么情况吗
Do you have any idea what's happening out there?

519
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,470
你开启了一场争夺  马库斯
You got the ball rolling, Marcus.

520
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,490
所有人都虎视眈眈
It's all up for grabs now--

521
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,190
同盟关系风云变幻  边界问题逐渐展现
Alliances shifting, frontiers opening up.

522
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,320
你们准备向台湾派遣第三支舰队
You're moving the third fleet towards Taiwan.

523
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:43,730
够用吗
Will it be enough?

524
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,050
你完全可以使用
Suddenly you could use

525
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,330
封锁这个岛的舰队
the ships you've got blockading my island.

526
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,910
你只需要给我一个机会
All you have to do is give me the chance

527
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,140
让我在公开法庭上说出真相
to tell the truth in open court.

528
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,150
我们都忙着重塑世界
We are reshaping the face of this planet,

529
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,400
你居然要求站在台上
and you want to stand on a soapbox

530
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,610
说什么真相
and plead for the truth?

531
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,190
你觉得这样你就是英雄了  做梦
You think that makes you a hero? It doesn't.

532
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,220
这让你看起来像个傻瓜
It makes you a fool.

533
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,860
因为最终
Because in the end,

534
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,160
真相由我们书写
the truth is gonna be whatever we say it is.

535
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:07,290
而这个地方  你  还有那些人
And this place, you, these people

536
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,190
只会成为小小的脚注
are gonna be a little footnote

537
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,660
存在于这个"一个分裂的国家如何
in a story about how a broken nation

538
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:14,610
在自由的指引下重新成为了
asserted itself in the cause of freedom

539
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,600
一个伟大的帝国"的故事里
and became a great empire once again.

540
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,130
你们对巴基斯坦所做的事
What you did to Pakistan...

541
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:22,630
有没有想过历史会如何评判
Do you ever wonder how history will judge you?

542
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:28,790
天呐  这里景色真美  不是吗
God... It's so beautiful here, isn't it?

543
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,870
长官  你确定要在这种时候打盹吗
Sir, are you honestly taking a nap right now?

544
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,470
科利知道拖延会让对方紧张
Well, Curry knows that delay heightens tension in one's opponent.

545
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,220
而紧张会导致不确定
Anxiety begets uncertainty.

546
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,440
山姆  你得试着呼吸
You really should breathe, Sam.

547
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,520
我在呼吸  我在呼吸
I'm breathing. I am breathing.

548
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,450
我还想继续呼吸下去
I'd like to keep it that way.

549
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,990
这给我们时间怀疑
It gives us time to doubt the possibility

550
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,130
期望目的达成的可能性
of our desired outcome.

551
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,880
一旦怀疑  就会退而求其次
We doubt, we settle for less.

552
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,580
那我们到底什么时候点头
And when exactly do we say yes?

553
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,630
我们的底线是什么
What's our bottom line?

554
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,770
你明知是什么
You know what it is.

555
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,220
我想听你亲口说出来
I want to hear you say it.

556
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,090
回家
To go home.

557
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:18,500
他们来了
They're coming.

558
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:20,550
什么事  亚瑟
What is it, Arthur?

559
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,090
出事了  无线电通信频繁
Something's up. There's a lot of radio chatter,

560
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:24,540
斯昭正在通卫星电话
and Straugh's on the sat phone.

561
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,940
我女儿还在海里
My daughter's out there.

562
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:28,480
你女儿已经成为一个能力卓越的军官  亚瑟
Your daughter has become a very capable officer, Arthur.

563
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,340
她处理得了
She can handle it.

564
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,420
抱歉  推迟了这么久
My apologies for the delay.

565
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,220
我带来了一份提议
I have with me here an offer.

566
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:42,750
很好
Very well.

567
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,860
总统先生宽宏大量
Your President was feeling generous.

568
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,890
他已授权
He has authorized...

569
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,510
别回应
Don't react.

570
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:55,420
操作员报告说  格蕾丝最后停留的位置
The E.W.S. reports three fast attack submarines

571
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,990
曾被三艘快攻潜艇包围
circling Grace's last known position.

572
00:23:58,450 --> 00:23:59,320
如果他们发现她了
If they've found her--

573
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,640
如果他们发现她了  我们早就死了
If they had found her, we'd already be dead.

574
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,450
我们让您扫兴了吗  艇长
Are we boring you, captain?

575
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,070
是啊  但我在听
Yes. But I'm listening.

576
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,920
预计空气余量

577
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,190
空气余量只能维持九分钟了
He's got nine minutes of air left.

578
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:13,870
仍在探测主动声纳  长官
Still searching active sonar, ma'am.

579
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,280
一旦探测到我们的艇壳反射回波
They bounce a ping off our hull.

580
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,960
他们马上就会下来将我们彻底击沉
They're gonna come down here and punch our clock for good.

581
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,030
只是早晚的事
It's just a matter of time.

582
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,520
情况我了解了  水手长  谢谢
I know the score, C.O.B. Thank you.

583
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:21,810
詹姆斯还在上面
James is still up there.

584
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:22,940
他可能还活着
He could be alive.

585
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,300
如果我们现在转到詹姆斯方向
If we make a break for James now,

586
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,090
那些攻击潜艇很可能会发现我们
there's a good chance those attack subs hear us.

587
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,230
到时候就插翅难飞了
I can't outrun them.

588
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,280
我们要等他们撤退
We wait for them to bug out.

589
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,500
你认为你能掌控生死吗
You think you can decide who lives and who dies?

590
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,100
你又不是上帝
You're not God.

591
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,920
在这艘艇上  我就是
On this ship, I am.

592
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:35,510
如果还有谁不满意的话
And if anyone else has a problem with that,

593
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,530
欢迎站出来指正
you're more than welcome to step outside.

594
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,010
以前做过紧急排水  凯希尔
Ever blown the tanks on a boomer, Mr.Cahill?

595
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,620
没在这个深度试过  长官
Not from this depth, ma'am, no.

596
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,250
你能行的
You'll do fine.

597
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,370
密切监测水平仪
Just watch your bubble.

598
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,400
一会可能会有碎片
There'll be some debris.

599
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:49,920
长官  碎片
Debris, ma'am?

600
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,540
如果潜艇能上升到发射深度
If we can get this boat up to firing depth,

601
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,260
我们就要动点儿真格的  逼他们撤退
we show them our teeth, we force them to back off.

602
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,580
水手长  让你的手下准备好鱼雷管
Chief of the boat, you tell your men to ready torpedo tubes

603
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,220
四枚全部待发
one through four in all respects.

604
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,610
本舰无法与快速攻击型潜艇对战
You can't shoot it out with fast attack submarines.

605
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,460
需要我重复一遍命令吗
Do you need me to repeat the order?

606
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,150
不用  长官
No, ma'am.

607
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,200
很好
Good.

608
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,360
怎么了
What's happening?

609
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,580
艇长勇气倍增
Captain's got sand in her swimsuit,

610
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,770
正带领我们走去天堂
so we're all headed to the le gran rodeo in the sky.

611
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:19,010
预计空气余量

612
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,650
你们这帮抛弃我的混蛋可能听不见
You runaway bastards probably can't hear me,

613
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,750
但是电池组已安装完毕
the battery packs are going in now,

614
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:30,160
那么...不用谢
so... you know, you're welcome.

615
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:32,140
我会在这儿等人来接的
I'll just be here waiting for my ride.

616
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,000
真好吃
That is really good.

617
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,870
不用说违心话
You don't have to say that.

618
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:42,290
说真的呢  真的很好吃
No, I mean it. Really, that's really good.

619
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,250
谁教你做饭的
Who taught you to cook?

620
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,390
-我妻子  -你结婚了
- My wife. - You're married?

621
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:49,700
不是  只是没办法说出"前任"这个词
I'm not. I just can't bring myself to say the "ex" part yet.

622
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,910
-抱歉  -没关系
- Sorry. - That's all right.

623
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:54,820
两年前我离婚了  必须学着喂饱自己
Two years ago. Had to learn how to feed myself.

624
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,500
其实  得学着做很多事
Learn how to do a lot of things, actually.

625
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,960
没想到自己会那么依赖一个人
It's surprising how much you can come to rely on someone.

626
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,710
堂娜离开后
When Donna left,

627
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,380
我花了很多时间重拾自我
took me a long time to remember who I was.

628
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,390
很奇怪  你竟然能如此痴迷一个人
It's strange, you can fall so far into a person

629
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:06,040
连自我都丧失了
that you just sort of disappear.

630
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,340
你一直在围着他们打转
You kind of become the space around them,

631
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,530
他们离开后  你不禁要问
and when they leave it's like,

632
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:10,950
"她就那么走了
"Well, now that she's gone,

633
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,730
我到底算什么”  你懂的
do I even exist?" You know?

634
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:18,060
如果你想  我可以留下来陪你
I could stay the night if you want.

635
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:22,020
不是你想的那样  我是说住在客房..
N-not like that. I-I just meant in the guest room

636
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,950
-如果你...  -你不该问的
- If--if you...  - You can't ask that.

637
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:27,230
是啊  我知道  对不起
Yeah, I know, I... I'm sorry.

638
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,000
你一个人没问题吧
You'll be all right here?

639
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:32,430
那就好
Okay.

640
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,420
我已经尽力在帮你了
I've tried to help you here.

641
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,570
总统先生已经给了你们一条体面的出路
The president's given you an honorable way out.

642
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:45,640
这位总统先生根本没明白我的意思
This president doesn't know the meaning of the word.

643
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,550
你可要三思啊  长官  人命关天
Be careful, sir. You are dealing with people's lives.

644
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,040
事实上  我倒觉得我们的存在
In fact, I imagine our presence here

645
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,960
很碍他老人家的眼啊
has become rather inconvenient for him.

646
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,680
也碍你们的眼
For all of you.

647
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,650
我们的总统先生现在的支持率是68%
Our president currently enjoys a 68% approval rating, so--

648
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:56,860
可不是嘛
I'm sure he does.

649
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,390
老布什1991年2月28号

650
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,850
获得沙漠风暴行动的胜利
on 28 February 1991.

651
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,780

21 months later, he was voted out of office.

652
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,210
所以别跟我说选票  我要公正的审判
So don't talk to me about polls. I want my trial.

653
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:07,500
你觉得会有人相信一个叛徒的话吗
And who do you think's going to believe a traitor?

654
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,470
我可握有整个阴谋的铁证啊
Oh, I have hard evidence of the whole sordid thing--

655
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:14,670
我的海豹突击队新朋友告诉我的
from my new navy S.E.A.L. pals.

656
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:17,970
撒谎  你根本没有
No, you don't.

657
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,150
你真应该把握时机杀了那些海报突击队员
You should have killed those S.E.A.L.s when you had the chance.

658
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,910
你的船员和初级军官可以免罪
Amnesty for your crew and junior officers.

659
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:34,600
你要归还我的潜艇和海豹突击队员
You return my submarine, my S.E.A.L.S.

660
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:38,300
你和副艇长就违反第92条军规进行认罪
You and the X.O. plead guilty to a violation of Article 92.

661
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,950
两年的保护性监禁
Two years protective custody.

662
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,950
不行
No.

663
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:47,810
-长官  我们能暂停商量一下吗  -不行

665
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,580
-艇长  -我要求公审  科利先生
- Captain... - I want a public trial, Mr. Curry.

666
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,250
那是不可能的
That's never gonna happen.

667
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:53,980
谈判结束了
So be it.

668
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:57,070
我会请来各大媒体  揭露你和
I'll invite the cameras here and try you

669
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,710
这位缺席总统的劣行
and the president in absentia.

670
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:05,520
你要来吗
You coming?

671
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,580
你到底想不想回家了
Did you ever give a damn about getting home?

672
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,790
山姆  如果你有意见
Sam, if you have objections--

673
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,470
也许你无家可归了  但我有
Maybe you have nowhere to go, but I do.

674
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,710
你的船员们也不是  
And so does your crew.

675
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:14,160
难道为了你那该死的真相
And, what, you're just gonna let them all burn

676
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:15,690
就要他们都跟着陪葬吗
for the sake of your damn truth?

677
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:16,860
我的真相
My truth?

678
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,180
是我的真相吗
My truth?!

679
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,160
山姆  新条件  把潜艇还给我
Sam, new offer. Get my boat back,

680
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,190
我保证你和格蕾丝・谢帕德
and I promise you and Grace Shepard

681
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,950
将免受牢狱之灾
will never see the inside of a prison.

682
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:29,990
我还将保证你和你娇妻的安全
I will guarantee your safety in the country of your choice

683
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:31,570
无论你们定居在哪个国家
with your beautiful wife.

684
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:34,240
别让他把你拉下水  山姆
Don't let him drag you down with him, Sam.

685
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,610
这已经是最优厚的条件了
Doesn't get better than this.

686
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,610
成交
You got a deal.

687
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:48,260
你立字为据  我还你潜艇
You put that in writing, you got your sub back.

688
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,420
成交  走吧  快  我们走
Deal. Let's get out of here. Come on! Let's go!

689
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,660
我是艇长
This is the Captain.

690
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:44,640
我父亲曾告诉我
My father once told never never to bet

691
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,000
别拿自己输不起的事打赌
more than I was willing to lose.

692
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,060
现在  你们都知道我的想法了
By now, you all know my intentions.

693
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:51,650
就是与敌交战  这会使舰艇陷入困境
I mean to engage our enemy and put this vessel in harm's way.

694
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,690
艇上所有人也都会有危险
Every life on this boat will be at risk.

695
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:58,080
这样做我输不起
It's more than I'm willing to lose.

696
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,770
但我不是在拿这舰艇下注
But I'm not betting on this boat,

697
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:02,500
我把赌注压在你们身上  因为水手们
I am betting on you, because you sailors

698
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:04,320
我相信你们
are a sure thing.

699
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,090
继续
Carry on.

700
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,870
他们来了

00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:10,520
距目标2800码
2,800 yards to target.

702
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,270
凯希尔  听我口令超速前进
Mr. Cahill, all ahead flank on my mark.

703
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:20,420

705
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,300
-22节  -正形成空泡
- 22 knots. - We're cavitating.

706
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,220
这什么意思  
What does that mean?

707
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,140
意味着我们要发动攻击
That means company's coming.

708
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,070
凯希尔  仰角30度
Mr. Cahill, up angle, 30 degrees.

709
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,000
发现目标  方位1-1-7度
Contact, bearing 1-1-7,

710
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,660
预计空气余量

711
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,770
距离5000码  正在靠近
range 5,000 yards. She's coming about.

712
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,560
-行动吧  凯希尔  -是 长官  23节
- On your horse, Mr. Cahill. - Aye, ma'am. 23 knots.

713
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,290
加油  宝贝
Come on, girl.

714
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,480
水手长  请到控制台
I need you up here, C.O.B.

715
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,980
发现新目标  距离4100码
New contact, 4,100 yards!

It's the "Illinois." Bearing 2-1-3.

717
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:49,800
长官  它在搜索我们
Ma'am, she's acquiring.

718
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,150
你是故意激怒我的
You provoked me.

719
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,950
想要我反抗
You wanted me to react.

720
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,450
没错  为了有个好结果

721
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,890
让你和格蕾丝能够回家
To get you and Grace home.

722
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:02,960
我还以为我们相互信任呢
I was under the impression that we trust each other.

723
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,570
我相信你的直觉  山姆
I trust your instincts, Sam.

724
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:07,920
只有把我们搞分裂了  科利才会完全同意
Curry was never gonna go all the way unless he could split us.

725
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,540
谈判就是在演戏
Negotiation is theater.

726
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,700
我要确保你的情绪看起来是真的
I had to be certain your emotion would be read as real.

不在乎你做什么

我愿意

740
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,630
我只有一个条件  允许我与我的艇员告别

799
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:03,290
他们在下面绕圈
We left them down there circling the plume.

800
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:06,110
艇体保持水平  打开导弹舱门

This is the captain of the S.S.B.N. "Colorado."

804
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,120
你们在卫星上也能看到  
As you can see on your satellites,

还有生命迹象吗

预计空气余量

821
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,050
我曾在苏比克[菲律宾城市]
I used to drink with this senior chief

822
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:58,200
和一个叫迪斯科的老水手长喝过酒
at Subic named Disco.

823
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,450
我们一定是喝遍了
We must have hit every

824
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:00,840
奥隆加坡[菲律宾城市]的烈酒
hooch hole in Olongapo,

825
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,460
直到有一天迪斯科在爆棚吧
till one night Disco fell in with this little honey-ko

826
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,000
偶遇他的小亲亲
from the boom boom bar.

827
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,830
我不是在说所谓的闪婚
And I'm not talking some 4-day marriage.

828
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:11,840
我说的是实实在在的爱情
I'm... I'm talking actual, factual love.

829
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,560
真动人  水手长
That's beautiful, C.O.B.

830
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:15,460
结束单身后  迪斯科破了产
End of liberty, Disco was flat broke,

831
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,050
他的亲亲想和他一刀两断  
and honey-ko was gonna cut him off,

832
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,030
可我是个浪漫的人
but I'm a romantic.

833
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,550
所以我告诉迪斯科  只要他把头埋进
So I tell Disco I'll give him 10 bucks

834
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,750
锦鲤池里  每分钟我会给他十美金
for every minute he holds his head in the koi pond.

835
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,340
花了我五十块
Cost me 50.

836
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:25,400
这个故事的重点是什么
Is there a point to this story?

837
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:29,240
重点是  他曾是海军海豹突击队的
Point is, he was a navy S.E.A.L.

838
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,200
听  你们听到了吗
There! Did you hear that?

839
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,040
长官
Uh, ma'am...

840
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,740
我想也许是
I think maybe...

841
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,310
敲打声
Tapping?

842
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,400
很微弱  但是
Very faint, but...

843
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:43,540
没错
Yes!

844
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,710
是摩斯密码  50码深
That's morse code. 50 feet.

845
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,670
-左舷  20度  -按此方向
- Port side, 20 degrees. - On that heading!

846
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:50,360
停车  准备救援
All stop. Stand by to retrieve.

847
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,050
他在说什么
What's he saying?

848
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,810
你不会想知道的  长官
You don't want to know, ma'am.

849
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,840
你具体是做什么的
So what is it you do, exactly?

850
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:13,720
重要的是我做过的事
It's what I did that matters.

851
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,170
我在山姆的潜艇上安装了一个罕有的设备
I put a very unique piece of equipment on Sam's submarine,

852
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:19,150
并且我相信这个设备
and I believe this equipment recorded information

853
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:20,380
记录下的信息  是某些
that certain powerful people would like

854
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:23,060
权势之人想极力掩饰的
to keep very secret.

855
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,410
那这些信息在哪儿
So where is it?

856
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:27,170
被偷了  被某个帮政府
Stolen... by a secret cabal

857
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,880
掩盖事实的秘密组织偷了
as part of a government cover-up.

858
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:30,300
相信我  我很确切地知道  
Trust me, I know exactly...

859
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,360
我信你
I believe you.

860
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:34,380
很好  因为我想让这些坏人
Good, because I intend to flush every one of these rats

861
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,430
全都无所遁形
into the light.

862
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,920
不过有个问题
But here's the thing.

863
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:43,750
我目前的权限有点受限
My, um, access is a bit limited at the moment.

864
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,320
所以我才需要你加入
So that's where you come in.

865
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,830
你想让我怎么做
What do you want me to do?

866
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,870
你希望你制造点新闻
I want you to make some noise.

867
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,150
我知道这一切对你来说有多可怕
I know how frightening this must all be for you.

868
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:54,680
没关系
All right.

869
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:55,820
我不会要求
I wouldn't ask--

870
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:58,350
我说过没关系  交给我
I said all right. I'll do it.

871
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:02,110
我也有条件  我的律师保罗・威尔斯
But I want something, too. My lawyer, Paul Wells--

872
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:04,310
他是山姆的知交  他还一直
He's an old friend of Sam's, and he's been...

873
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:07,090
尽其能地陪我度过难关
amazing helping me through all this.

874
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,460
-好啊  -不过他是政府
- Okay. - But he's a government agent

875
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:12,440
派来监视我策反我跟山姆敌对的特工
sent to spy on me and turn me against Sam.

876
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,310
你怎么知道
How do you know?

877
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:17,600
女人的第六感
Because the other woman always knows.

878
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,360
事实是  我婚姻中的每一天
The truth is, I've shared my husband

879
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,920
都在与人共享我丈夫
every single day of this marriage.

880
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:26,350
山姆・肯德尔深爱着自己的祖国
Sam Kendal is in love with his country,

881
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:28,800
无论顺境与逆境  无论疾病与健康
for better or worse, in sickness and in health,

882
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,210
他永远不会背叛她
and he would never betray her.

883
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,190
不为钱财  没有什么能改变他
Not for money. Not for anything.

884
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:38,360
甚至是我
Not even me.

885
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,360
科罗拉多号汇报任务已完成
"Colorado" reports mission accomplished.

886
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,210
潜艇及全体人员安然无恙

888
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:53,710
空气耗尽你还憋了六分钟
I clocked you at six minutes past reserves.

889
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:54,910
你怎么办到的
How did you do that?

890
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,770
我只是告诉自己的身体不拼就是死路一条
I just told my body you'd left it for dead.

891
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,920
当时那是个艰难的决定  金  
It was a tough call, King.

892
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,080
真高兴你归队了
I'm glad you're back.

893
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:08,160
有多艰难
How tough?

894
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:17,470
立正
Ten-hut!

895

长官到
Officer on deck!

896
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:33,610
他们想沉了潜艇  长官
They tried to sink the sub, sir.

897
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,720
他们闯过了200英里无人区边界
They broke the 200-mile line.

898
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,110
是的  没错
Yes, they did.

899
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,520
我们该如何回应
So how are we gonna respond?

900
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:40,880
不回应
We're not.

901
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,830
一位高级内阁顾问今天
A senior white house adviser

902
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:44,190
在这里遇害了  长官

903
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,990
部长本人也挨了一颗枪子
The secretary himself took a bullet.

904
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:48,540

No, he didn't. Curry knows the game.

905
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,800
除非有万无一失的准备
Never admit to being attacked unless you're prepared

906
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,220
千万别承认受到了袭击
to pay the price for your response.

907
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,710
所以  这事从未发生
So... this never happened,

908
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:57,010
他们也从没来过
and they were never here.

909
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:00,600
你要怎么跟格蕾丝说她父亲的事
What are you gonna tell Grace about her father?

910
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,520
若是你  你希望我怎么说

911
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:05,240
直奔主题快速解决

我就想你这么说
I was hoping you'd say that.

你们带着一名伤兵从巴基斯坦匆忙撤离
You guys bug out of Pakistan with a wounded man,

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,109
几小时之后美国就发动了核轰炸
and a few hours later, the U.S. is nuking the joint?

00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,310
你怎么看待这两件事间的联系
How do you connect the dots?

你真应该把握时机
You should've killed those s.E.A.L.S

杀了那些海豹突击队员

这是我的岛
This is my island.

想让我同意你们留下
If I allow your presence,

Mrs. Kendal... What do you think about your husband's actions?

他是政府派来监视我的特工
He's a government agent sent to spy on me

20
00:00:44,999 --> 00:00:46,463
还要策反我跟山姆敌对
and turn me against Sam.

21
00:00:46,464 --> 00:00:48,078
你到底想不想回家了
You ever give a damn about getting home?

00:08:03,532 --> 00:08:05,254
副艇长  别激动  专注任务
Easy, X.O. Stay on target.

134
00:08:05,255 --> 00:08:08,466
把它关掉  给我接视频信号  马上
Hey, you, get rid of that and get me my video feed. Now.

135
00:08:11,276 --> 00:08:14,183
对不起  我不知道他今天怎么了
I'm sorry. I don't know what's wrong with him today.

136
00:08:14,184 --> 00:08:16,162
没事  不要紧  不过是张照片
No, it's fine. It's fine. It's just a picture.

137
00:08:30,254 --> 00:08:31,830
我以为你会高兴的
I thought you'd be pleased.

138
00:08:32,732 --> 00:08:35,022
你说你不能回家是因为霍普重伤
You said you couldn't go home because Hopper was hurt,

139
00:08:35,023 --> 00:08:37,120
现在他已经没事了
but now he's okay, so--

140
00:08:37,121 --> 00:08:38,097
我就可以走了
So now I can go.

141
00:08:38,098 --> 00:08:39,021
是啊
Yeah.

142
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,861
我欣喜若狂
I'm ecstatic.

143
00:08:42,378 --> 00:08:43,267
那么
So...

144
00:08:45,018 --> 00:08:46,019
你...
Are you...

145
00:08:47,098 --> 00:08:48,086
要回家了吗
going home?

146
00:08:48,087 --> 00:08:49,057
我还没决定
I haven't decided.

147
00:08:49,058 --> 00:08:50,220
但是你想走
But you want to.

148
00:08:50,221 --> 00:08:51,591
我怎么想并不重要
Doesn't matter what I want.

149
00:08:51,626 --> 00:08:52,673
我有工作要做
I got a job to do,

150
00:08:52,673 --> 00:08:53,966
海湾大桥可通不到这里
and the bay bridge doesn't reach this far.

151
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,512
我一直都想看看...
I've always wanted to see the...

152
00:08:57,192 --> 00:08:58,323
天呐
Oh, my god.

那好像是我妈
That looks like my mom.

154
00:09:02,895 --> 00:09:03,896
什么
What?

155
00:09:05,742 --> 00:09:06,695
坚持住
Hold on!

156
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:16,141
我的头怎么这样疼
Why does my head hurt so much?

157
00:09:26,627 --> 00:09:27,208
接通了吗
You getting through?

158
00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:29,618
转接有问题  但是我想就快了
Trouble with the relay, but soon, I think.

159
00:09:30,745 --> 00:09:31,906
要什么东西吗
You need anything?

160
00:09:32,057 --> 00:09:33,219
不用  我没事
No, I'm okay.

161
00:09:33,256 --> 00:09:34,621
我的视频记录呢
And what about my video feed?

162
00:09:34,966 --> 00:09:35,643
我正在想办法
I'm working on it.

163
00:09:35,644 --> 00:09:36,591
越快越好
Well, the sooner the better.

164
00:09:36,592 --> 00:09:39,449
听着伙计  除非你懂我的活该怎么干
Look, mate, unless you know how to do my job,

165
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,245
否则不如出去凉快着让我安心干活
why don't you just chill out and let me do my job?

166
00:09:43,947 --> 00:09:44,965
好
Okay.

167
00:09:45,838 --> 00:09:47,678
镇上发生了严重情况
We got a serious issue in town.

168
00:09:47,678 --> 00:09:48,428
稍等  水手长
One second, C.O.B.

169
00:09:48,428 --> 00:09:50,128
-好了  可以连线了  -先别接通
- Okay, your line is open. - Yeah, hold the line.

170
00:09:50,328 --> 00:09:51,538
奈杰尔  我需要视频记录
Nigel, I need the video feed.

171
00:09:51,538 --> 00:09:52,948
闭"嘴"  姐妹
Cross your legs, sister.

172
00:09:53,288 --> 00:09:54,558
我说了我正在想办法
I said I was working on it.

173
00:09:54,558 --> 00:09:56,168
我不知道你有什么问题
I don't know what your problem is,

174
00:09:56,308 --> 00:09:58,628
但是你给我解决它  现在就解决
but you sort it out, and you sort it out right now.

175
00:10:08,723 --> 00:10:09,693
问题解决了
Problem sorted.

176
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:13,353
求求你们  别说话了
Please, everyone, just-- just stop talking.

177
00:10:13,743 --> 00:10:14,433
求你们
Please.

178
00:10:14,433 --> 00:10:16,113
声音太吵
Oh, it's so loud in here.

179
00:10:17,502 --> 00:10:19,252
全镇都是这种情况
Same thing's happening all over town.

180
00:10:19,432 --> 00:10:21,242
我以前见过类似的场面  绝对不是好事
I've seen this party before, and it's not good.

181
00:10:21,242 --> 00:10:22,182
我们中毒了
We've been dosed.

182
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,092
是一种叫做BZ的药  很厉害
It's a pretty serious drug called B.Z.

183
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:27,072
军方发明的  绰号"脑轰鸣"
Military designed it, nickname "Buzz."

184
00:10:27,202 --> 00:10:28,122
我做过实验对象
I was a guinea pig.

185

我和兄弟们曾去做过志愿  
Me and some buddies volunteered

当年的音乐可没这么难听
back when music didn't suck.

187
00:10:31,257 --> 00:10:32,447
有外块赚当然好
Extra cash was nice,

188
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:34,357
但即便是低剂量  也不是闹着玩的
but even at a low dose, it was no picnic.

189
00:10:34,357 --> 00:10:35,207
有好消息吗
There any good news?

190
00:10:35,317 --> 00:10:36,277
有  不会致死
Well, it doesn't kill you.

191
00:10:36,277 --> 00:10:36,967
找到了

Um, "B.Z. is an odorless military incapacitating agent.

症状持续时间约八小时"
"Symptoms last about eight hours."

197
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:53,811
这是一次协同攻击
This is a coordinated attack.

198
00:10:53,811 --> 00:10:54,771
对  但毒药是怎么进来的
Yeah, but how'd it get here?

199
00:10:54,673 --> 00:10:56,713
实验时他们一般掺在柠檬水里
Well, in the experiment, they mixed it with lemonade.

这个岛上只有一个主要水源
Well, the island's only got one main water supply.

- They dose that, they knock out everyone. - Smart.

解毒方法呢
Countermeasures?

203
00:11:01,758 --> 00:11:03,828
医生曾给我注射肾上腺素解毒
Well, the docs used adrenaline to snap me out of it.

204
00:11:03,828 --> 00:11:06,268
"可使用多种肾上腺素和过敏疫苗"
"Can also use epinephrine, epipens, allergy shots."

205
00:11:06,268 --> 00:11:07,928
科罗拉多号医务室里面有这些药
"Colorado" has those in the med locker.

206
00:11:07,928 --> 00:11:09,058
本地的医院里应该也有

207
00:11:09,338 --> 00:11:10,468
我们得抓紧行动
We gotta move fast.

208
00:11:11,288 --> 00:11:12,973
好  水手长  上尉  你们跟我一起
All right, C.O.B., lieutenant, you're with me.

我们负责下潜隐藏潜艇

用艇上的药度过危险

副艇长  你负责岛上

去医院拿肾上腺素

给自己和必需人员注射

There's not a lot of bees on submarines, ma'am.

Aren't you gonna sit down?

407
00:23:02,993 --> 00:23:03,950
你离开那么久
You were gone for so long,

408
00:23:03,951 --> 00:23:05,887
我以为你永远不会回来了
I thought you were never coming home.

409
00:23:07,798 --> 00:23:10,276
为什么你总让我独守空房 山姆
Why are you always leaving me alone, Sam?

410
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,486
我不想这样的  可我没有办法
I don't want to leave you alone. But I have to.

411
00:23:11,487 --> 00:23:13,433
-抱歉  -你才不抱歉呢
- I'm sorry. - You're not sorry.

412
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:15,565
马库斯给你那份文职工作
When Marcus offered you that desk job,

413
00:23:15,565 --> 00:23:17,680
你首先想到的居然是...
your first thought was...

414
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:20,796
老天  我希望克里斯蒂不要知道这件事
God, I hope Christine doesn't find out about that.

415
00:23:23,464 --> 00:23:24,351
不是这样的
No, it wasn't.

416
00:23:26,383 --> 00:23:28,753
不是吗
It wasn't?

417
00:23:31,682 --> 00:23:33,616
我只是想自己决定  仅此而已
Look, I just want my own command. That's all.

418
00:23:33,617 --> 00:23:35,218
那是不是又一件
Is that just another one of those things

419
00:23:35,219 --> 00:23:37,153
你不希望克里斯蒂知道的事
that you hope Christine doesn't find out about?

420
00:23:37,154 --> 00:23:38,122
你不了解情况
You don't know what it's like.

421
00:23:38,123 --> 00:23:39,696
被拷问那件事呢
To be tortured?

422
00:23:41,449 --> 00:23:43,151
他们对你做了什么
What did they do to you?

423
00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:45,482
我爱你
I love you.

424
00:23:45,483 --> 00:23:47,698
-你不想让我爱你吗  -我当然想
- Don't you want me to love you? - Of course I do.

425
00:23:47,698 --> 00:23:48,855
那为什么不信任我
Then why don't you trust me?

426
00:23:48,856 --> 00:23:49,764
我当然信任你
I do trust you.

427
00:23:49,765 --> 00:23:50,877
那是为什么
What is it then?

428
00:23:57,179 --> 00:23:58,847
我不信任自己
I don't trust myself.

429
00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:01,160
的确不该
Well, you shouldn't.

430
00:24:04,024 --> 00:24:05,813
也不该相信他
And you shouldn't trust him.

431
00:24:08,729 --> 00:24:10,259
能帮个忙吗
Help me out, would you?

432
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,584
我只有一只手
I only got one arm.

433
00:24:11,585 --> 00:24:12,864
该死  好疼
Damn, that hurts.

434
00:24:22,776 --> 00:24:23,471
你还好吗
Are you okay?

435
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:27,070
她会醒的  稍等一下
She'll come around. Just give her a minute.

436
00:24:41,836 --> 00:24:43,018
你叫什么来着
Hey, remind me of your name.

437
00:24:44,768 --> 00:24:45,669
麦克卢尔
Mcclure.

438
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:47,239
-后勤的麦克卢尔  -是的
- Mcclure in supply. - Yeah.

439
00:24:47,409 --> 00:24:48,926
你的上级军官是...
And you report to Senior Watch...

440
00:24:48,927 --> 00:24:51,087
-阿诺德军士长  -俄亥俄的比尔・阿诺德

441
00:24:51,087 --> 00:24:53,935
是啊  俄亥俄
Right, Ohio.

442
00:24:55,006 --> 00:24:56,551
是啊  抱歉
Right, right, right. Sorry.

443
00:24:57,697 --> 00:24:59,589
但他上个月就晋升了
But he got promoted last month.

444
00:25:45,639 --> 00:25:46,806
你是谁
Who are you?

445
00:25:46,807 --> 00:25:48,423
你来这儿有什么目的
Huh?! Why are you here?

446
00:25:54,141 --> 00:25:55,524
你在干什么  山姆
What are you doing, Sam?

447
00:25:55,525 --> 00:25:57,406
纠正这一切  等着我  克里斯蒂
I'm gonna fix everything. You'll see, Christine.

448
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,470
我很快就回来了  我保证
I'm gonna be home soon. I promise.

449

我保证
I promise.

你是谁
Who are you?

451
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:10,705
说话
Tell me.

452
00:26:11,923 --> 00:26:12,566

你实在不擅长猜词
You're terrible at this.

顺便告诉你  是"吉普赛人"

你知道一秒是多久吧

Devastating. So do we have a working comm or what?

When you woke, there would be no reason for you to stay.

546
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,035
好似一只老鼠"
like a rat."

547
00:31:57,538 --> 00:32:00,335
预警站呼叫科罗拉多号  收到请回答
E.W.S. to "Colorado." Come in, "Colorado."

548
00:32:02,447 --> 00:32:04,029
你确定设备正常吗
Are you sure it's working?

549
00:32:04,405 --> 00:32:06,302
是的  应该有用
Yes, it should be.

550
00:32:07,568 --> 00:32:09,720
科罗拉多号请回答  我是副艇长
Come in, "Colorado." This is the X.O.

551
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:15,453
能不能请你  再检查一遍信号
Can you please, can you just recheck the signal?

552
00:32:15,736 --> 00:32:18,059
信号没问题  我检查过了
The signal is good. I have checked.

553
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,638
也许他们遇到了麻烦
Um, perhaps they have a problem--

554
00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:21,652
请你再检查一遍信号行吗  拜托了
Can you please just recheck the signal? Please.

555
00:32:21,653 --> 00:32:24,420
别发火  好吗  我在尽力而为
Don't get angry, okay? I'm doing my best.

556
00:32:24,624 --> 00:32:26,258
我不是发火  对不起  我很抱歉
I'm not. I'm not. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

557
00:32:26,258 --> 00:32:28,320
对不起  我没有  没有
I'm sorry. I'm not. I'm not.

558
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,009
现在大家都不容易
It is difficult in this place for everyone.

559
00:32:33,753 --> 00:32:35,070
你好像应对得还不错
You seem to be handling it very well.

560
00:32:35,071 --> 00:32:36,978
相信我  我并不好受
I promise you, I'm not.

561
00:32:38,893 --> 00:32:42,278
道德是有底线的
There is a line of morals, okay?

562
00:32:42,573 --> 00:32:45,518
一旦你越过了它  内心永无平静可言
When you cross this line, you never have peace.

563
00:32:52,253 --> 00:32:54,634
你额头上有血迹
You--you have some blood on your forehead.

564
00:33:00,474 --> 00:33:01,539
抱歉
Sorry.

565
00:33:06,203 --> 00:33:09,146
预警站呼叫科罗拉多号  收到请回答
Uh, E.W.S. to "Colorado." Come in, "Colorado."

566
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:05,649
预警站呼叫科罗拉多号  收到请回答
E.W.S. to "Colorado." Come in, "Colorado."

567
00:34:08,597 --> 00:34:11,384
预警站呼叫科罗拉多号  收到请回答
E.W.S. to "Colorado." Come in, "Colorado."

568
00:34:13,981 --> 00:34:14,879
收到  预警站
Roger, E.W.S.

569
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,493
我们大约在五英里外
We're about 5 miles out,

570
00:34:16,494 --> 00:34:17,991
潜艇看起来一切正常
and it looks like the sub's all right.

571
00:34:17,992 --> 00:34:19,828
我们会等到艇员醒来
We'll wait for the crew to wake up, and we'll

572
00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:22,001
确认安全后立即返航
make our way back once we get an all clear.

573
00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:24,002
岸上一切都好吗
How are things on the beach?

574
00:34:24,003 --> 00:34:25,661
预警站已经安全  长官
E.W.S. is secure, sir.

575
00:34:25,662 --> 00:34:26,923
但有人员伤亡
Not without a body count, though,

576
00:34:26,924 --> 00:34:28,747
包括两名海豹突击队员
including two of the SEALs--

577
00:34:28,785 --> 00:34:30,096
沃格勒和蒙克
Vogler and Monk.

578
00:34:31,195 --> 00:34:32,850
收到  科罗拉多号完毕
Roger that. "Colorado" out.

579
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,681
他们为什么想抓我们
Why'd those guys want me and you?

580
00:34:38,682 --> 00:34:39,655
你以为呢
What do you think?

581
00:34:39,656 --> 00:34:41,094
你我进过巴基斯坦的那个房间
We were the two in the room in Pakistan.

582
00:34:41,095 --> 00:34:42,859
只有我们俩个人知道交火的原因
We're the only ones who know why the bullets started flying.

583
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:45,759
我只知道  我们杀了本来要救的人
All I know is, we killed the guy we were sent in to save.

584
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:48,061
我还是不明白原因
I still don't know why.

585
00:34:48,328 --> 00:34:52,076
任务指令由解救变为消灭
The mission directive got changed from extraction to elimination.

586
00:34:52,238 --> 00:34:53,826
我没接到新指令
I wasn't given new orders.

587
00:34:54,913 --> 00:34:55,981
我收到了
I was.

588
00:35:01,841 --> 00:35:02,663
请进
Enter.

589
00:35:04,534 --> 00:35:06,566
长官  换班艇员已登艇
Sir, relief crew is on board.

590
00:35:06,567 --> 00:35:07,779
其他人已经上岸
Everyone else is already ashore.

591
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,859
我让一艘小艇在外候命
I've got a skiff waiting to take you back

592
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:09,559
等你准备完毕后送你上岸
if you're ready.

593
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,734
我得先刮胡子  上尉
I'm just gonna scrape off the fuzz, lieutenant.

594
00:35:11,853 --> 00:35:12,935
当了30年海军
After 30 years of shaving in the navy,

595
00:35:12,936 --> 00:35:14,214
在岸上刮胡子反而容易伤到自己
I have a tendency to cut myself on land.

596
00:35:14,215 --> 00:35:14,983
明白
Understood. 

597
00:35:14,984 --> 00:35:17,774
估计我近期不会敢拿任何尖锐的东西了
Don't think I'll be holding anything sharp for a little while.

598
00:35:17,774 --> 00:35:19,326
我马上就来
I'll be right up.

599
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:37,819
塞拉特显然是他们的内应
Serrat was obviously the man on the inside.

600
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,121
不知道他是从哪里弄来的BZ
I don't know how he got the B.Z.,

601
00:35:39,122 --> 00:35:40,772
但是他把药投进了水里
but he got it in the water.

602
00:35:40,903 --> 00:35:42,348
要是他们的头儿没被射杀
If their leader survives the gunshot,

603
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:43,798
或许能告诉我们答案
maybe we can ask him.

604
00:35:44,124 --> 00:35:45,843
问题是那些人怎样联络塞拉特
It's interesting that someone was able to contact him

605
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:47,345
并策划攻击
and set up the attack.

606
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:50,802
也许他有电台或者卫星电话
Maybe he's got a radio or--or a sat phone?

607
00:35:50,934 --> 00:35:52,825
或者艇员中有人帮助他
Or maybe someone on our crew helped him.

608
00:35:54,164 --> 00:35:56,309
你觉得艇员中有人在为...
You think someone on our crew is working...

609
00:35:56,374 --> 00:35:57,753
为谁工作
working for who?

610
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,024
我不知道
I don't know.

611
00:35:59,053 --> 00:36:00,522
但我昏迷的时候  
But when I was unconscious, 

612
00:36:00,523 --> 00:36:02,259
有人拿走了我的核弹发射钥匙
someone took my firing key.

613
00:36:03,303 --> 00:36:05,891
我们现在失去了发射核武器的能力
We now have no nuclear launch capabilities.

614
00:36:06,319 --> 00:36:07,793
如果他们的目标就是钥匙
If the plan was to steal the key,

615
00:36:07,793 --> 00:36:08,883
我们怎么能活到现在
then how come we're still alive?

616
00:36:08,884 --> 00:36:10,449
完全没有道理
That doesn't make any sense.

617
00:36:11,556 --> 00:36:13,879
没了核弹发射钥匙  我们简直任人宰割
We are defenseless without our firing key.

618
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,921
也许他们只是想给我们施压
Maybe they want to make us sweat.

619
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,395
或者他们正在赶来
Maybe they're on the way here.

620
00:36:16,396 --> 00:36:18,112
又或者他们想先让自己人安全撤离
Maybe their plan was to extract their men first.

621
00:36:18,113 --> 00:36:20,638
无论如何  我们必须找到钥匙
Either way, we have to find the key.

622
00:36:22,015 --> 00:36:23,617
处理一下伤口
You should get that taken care of.

623
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,280
我会的
I will.

624
00:36:26,314 --> 00:36:27,736
看来你们打得很惨烈
Must have been a hell of a fight.

625
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:32,801
说实话  我不记得了
Honestly, I don't remember.

626
00:36:35,674 --> 00:36:36,948
你会想起来的
It'll come back to you.

627
00:36:37,127 --> 00:36:38,031
至少会想起大半
Most of it, at least.

628
00:36:48,352 --> 00:36:50,610
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}化学攻击3小时后

629
00:36:53,154 --> 00:36:54,402
你到底是谁
Who are you?

630
00:36:55,654 --> 00:36:57,173
你来这里想干什么
What are you doing here?

631
00:36:59,888 --> 00:37:00,982
说话
Tell me.

632
00:37:02,065 --> 00:37:03,345
说啊
Tell me!

633
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:04,402
别这样
Stop it.

634
00:37:04,403 --> 00:37:07,133
别再对我撒谎了  山姆
Stop lying to me, Sam.

635
00:37:07,134 --> 00:37:07,870
什么
What?

636
00:37:07,871 --> 00:37:10,184
山姆  好久不见啊
Hey, Sam. I haven't seen you for a while.

637
00:37:12,849 --> 00:37:13,972
保罗
Paul?

638
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,300
你为什么在我家里
Why are you in my house?

639
00:37:16,995 --> 00:37:18,823
你怎么和我妻子在一起
What are you doing with my wife?

640
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:20,537
你以为克里斯蒂会傻到
You think Christine's the kind of woman

641
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:22,989
一直遥遥无期地等下去吗
that's gonna wait forever for you to come home?

642
00:37:23,689 --> 00:37:24,902
天呐  瞧瞧她
I mean, god, look at her.

643
00:37:24,903 --> 00:37:25,464
怎么会遥遥无期
It's not forever.

644
00:37:25,465 --> 00:37:26,727
他这话是什么意思  我对你说过...
Why is he saying forever? I told you...

645
00:37:26,728 --> 00:37:28,402
你看她有多美
Look how beautiful she is.

646
00:37:28,403 --> 00:37:30,625
老兄  你怎能把娇妻丢下不管
And you're gonna leave this unattended, buddy?

647
00:37:30,626 --> 00:37:31,944
女人是有需求的
Women have needs.

648
00:37:31,945 --> 00:37:35,287
要是你不来照顾她  我可求之不得
If you don't... I sure as hell will.

10649
00:37:35,367 --> 00:37:37,255
山姆  一切就要结束了
This is the beginning of the end, Sam.

650
00:37:37,256 --> 00:37:38,780
你说什么呢  不是的
What are you talking about? No, it's not.

651
00:37:38,781 --> 00:37:39,662
你看
Look.

652
00:37:47,246 --> 00:37:48,869
看看你对他做了什么
Look what you did to him.

653
00:37:49,828 --> 00:37:51,503
你差点把他打死
You almost killed him.

654
00:37:56,689 --> 00:37:58,238
我会永远爱你
I'll always love you.

655
00:38:03,967 --> 00:38:04,915
别离开我
Don't leave me.

656
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:06,738
我不能失去你  我不要失去你
I can't lose you. I'm not gonna lose you.

657
00:38:06,739 --> 00:38:08,142
那就快回家
Then come home.

658
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:12,766
我必须坚持到底
I have to finish this.

659
00:38:12,767 --> 00:38:14,593
否则我的艇员就会丧命
If I don't, my people will die.

660
00:38:14,593 --> 00:38:15,943
我绝不会让这种事情发生
I'm not gonna let that happen.

661
00:38:15,944 --> 00:38:17,724
那我们怎么办  山姆
What about us, Sam?

662
00:38:19,618 --> 00:38:20,945
这一针下去
When you do that...

663
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,615
我就会消失
I'll be gone,

664
00:38:25,207 --> 00:38:27,435
或许你再也不会见到我
and you may never see me again.

665
00:38:27,652 --> 00:38:29,296
你为什么要这样
Why would you do that?

666
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:33,246
别走
Stay.

667
00:38:40,624 --> 00:38:42,070
对不起
I'm sorry.

668
00:38:44,459 --> 00:38:46,628
你不会回来了  是吧
You're never coming back, are you?

669
00:38:49,943 --> 00:38:50,993
一切都会好起来的
Everything's gonna be different now.

670
00:38:50,993 --> 00:38:52,189
别说了
Stop it.

671
00:38:52,435 --> 00:38:55,034
无论我走多远  总会回到你身边
I always find my way back, don't I?

672
00:38:58,727 --> 00:39:00,374
你这是干什么
What are you doing?

673
00:39:29,198 --> 00:39:30,762
我很快就回来了
I'm gonna be home soon.

674
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:33,209
我保证
I promise.

675
00:39:43,521 --> 00:39:46,027
我只是来向你道声晚安
I just, uh, wanted to say good night

676
00:39:46,028 --> 00:39:48,943
还有  再次为我今天的行为道歉
and, uh, to apologize again for anything I may have...

677
00:39:48,944 --> 00:39:51,154
你当时无法控制自己
You weren't yourself, so...

678
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:54,415
是啊  我想是吧
No, I, um...I suppose not.

679
00:39:56,945 --> 00:39:58,666
你在忙什么
Uh, what are you working on?

680
00:39:59,796 --> 00:40:02,215
遇袭期间  监控一直在录像
The cameras were still recording during the attack.

681
00:40:02,216 --> 00:40:04,159
太好了  能让我看看吗
Oh, brilliant. Can I--can I see?

682
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,517
明天吧
Oh, tomorrow?

683
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,951
今天大家都太累了
Um, it's been a long day, right?

684
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:23,540
一切都会好起来的  我保证
Everything's gonna be different now. I promise.

685
00:40:23,868 --> 00:40:24,988
别说了
Stop it.

686
00:40:26,129 --> 00:40:28,437
无论我走多远  总会回到你身边
I always find my way back, don't I?

687
00:40:30,322 --> 00:40:31,814
你这是干什么
What are you doing?

688
00:40:38,822 --> 00:40:40,134
你这是干什么
What are you doing?

689
00:40:56,341 --> 00:40:57,653
别这样
Stop it.

690
00:40:57,911 --> 00:41:00,378
无论我走多远  总会回到你身边
I always find my way back, don't I?

691
00:41:00,379 --> 00:41:01,819
你这是干什么
What are you doing?

692
00:41:48,029 --> 00:41:51,430
《破釜沉舟》下周五继续  敬请锁定人人影视
Last resort, all new next thursday at 8/7 central line on abc.

1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:03,080
《破釜沉舟》上集回顾

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,800
我们正遭到攻击  我们被下毒了
We're under attack. We have been drugged.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,730
他们告诉我  把药投入水里
They told me, put their drug in the water,

4
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:06,700
你们就会睡着
and you would go to sleep.

5
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,210
他们答应让我夺回我的岛
They promised me my island back.

6
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:09,440
外面那些人是你杀的吗
Did you kill those men out there?

7
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,450
我到这的时候  你的朋友都已经死了
Your friends were already dead when I got here.

8
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,390
我没时间装绅士
I don't have time to do it the nice way.

9
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,810
你我的协定很简单
We made a very simple arrangement.

10
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,140
一切都可以改变
Everything's negotiable.

11
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,280
你是谁
Who are you?

12
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,500
说话 说啊
Tell me. Tell me!

13
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,770
他是政府派来监视我的特工 
He's a government agent sent to spy on me

14
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:23,990
并策反我跟山姆敌对
and turn me against Sam.

15
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,740
我会纠正这一切  等着我  克里斯蒂
I'm gonna fix everything. You'll see, Christine.

16
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,510
你在干什么  山姆
What are you doing, Sam?

17
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,520
巴特勒艇长可以火力解决科罗拉多号
Captain Butler has a firing solution on the "Colorado."

18
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,450
我现在就可以杀了你
I could kill you right now.

19
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,890
你想引发战争吗
Do you want a war?

20
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:35,830
当我昏迷的时候
When I was unconscious,

21
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,330
有人拿走了我的核弹发射钥匙
someone took my firing key.

22
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,030
我们现在失去了发射核武器的能力
We now have no nuclear launch capabilities.

23
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,000
谢帕德上尉  他还要这样干多久
Lieutenant Shepard, how much longer is he gonna take?

24
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:51,950
我们是按照命令行事
We do what we're told.

25
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,770
按照命令行事  才使我们落到如今的地步
'Cause that's worked out so well for us so far.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,310
实在太过分了
It's outrageous.

27
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,780
副艇长  快检查完了吧
You almost done, X.O.?

28
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,460
我觉得有些人再过30秒
I think some of these guys are about 30 seconds

29
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,950
就会以下犯上  抗命不从
from coming over here and getting an article 90.

30
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,670
需要多久就该多久  上尉
Well, it's gonna take as long as it takes, Lieutenant.

31
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:05,860
那是我的包  长官
That's my bag, sir.

32
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:06,820
抱歉  没人能豁免
I'm sorry. No one's exempt.

33
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,800
我们不知道在BZ袭击中是谁在协助他们
We don't know who helped those men with the B.Z. attack.

34
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,050
我们知道是谁攻击了我们
We know who attacked us.

35
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:11,780
是塞拉特的协助下的秘密行动组
Black ops with help from Serrat.

36
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,850
那是谁偷了潜艇上的肾上腺素注射剂
Then who stole the EpiPens on the sub?

37
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,960
我们之中有内鬼  你我都清楚
There's somebody on the inside. You know it, and I know it.

38
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,980
为什么不让我帮你呢
Why don't you just let me help you?

39
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,530
非得要我把话说明白吗  上尉
Do I have to spell it out for you, lieutenant?

40
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:19,570
所以说我也是嫌疑人吗
So I'm a suspect?

41
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,220
你认为我背叛了大家吗
You think that I betrayed the crew?

42
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,400
我不知道
I don't know.

43
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,420
你可以走了
You're dismissed.

44
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,500
你在对我耍官威吗
You're pulling rank on me?

45
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,280
我不用耍官威  上尉  我有这权力
I don't pull rank, lieutenant. I have rank.

46
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,220
没找到钥匙
No sign of the key.

47
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,550
但如果我们一直这样对待他们
But if we keep treating them like this,

48
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,520
我们就会失去威信
we're gonna lose 'em.

49
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,700
钥匙被盗时  在艇上的只有艇员  
The only people on board when the key was stolen were crew members,

50
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,440
副艇长
X.O.

51
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,050
他们中有一个是敌人
One of them is the enemy,

52
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,470
在我们把他揪出来之前
and until we find out who,

53
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,180
只有你我能知道钥匙被盗这件事
the only people who can know about the key are you and me.

54
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,510
但已经过了48小时了  长官
But it's been 48 hours, sir.

55
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,940
如果对方的目的是让我们失去防御力
If the goal was to render us defenseless,

56
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,420
那为什么我们还没死
then how come we're not already dead?

57
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,670
叛徒只是得手之后尚未汇报
Our judas hasn't reported their success yet.

58
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,910
但一旦他们这么做了
But once they do...

59
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:00,670
至少让我告诉格蕾丝
At least let me tell Grace.

60
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,320
格蕾丝的父亲正被军事羁押  山姆
Grace's father was hauled out of here in military custody, Sam.

61
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,700
难道她没有可能一时冲动吗
Is it impossible to imagine her doing something rash?

62
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,780
我完全信任谢帕德上尉  长官
I back lieutenant Shepard 100%, sir.

63
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,180
百分之百
100%.

64
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,180
在这件事结束之前  我们只以事实说话
Until this thing is over, we will be ruled by fact

65
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,090
而非情感
and not emotion,

66
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,480
事实是  我们被背叛了
and the fact is, we have been betrayed.

67
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,430
我们继续搜查全体艇员
We keep searching the crew.

68
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,750
我们若再这么下去  军心就会散掉
We keep this up, we're not gonna have a crew.

69
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,100
安静  我的铺位也被他们搜了
Quiet! They tossed my bunk, too.

70
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,540
我可没抱怨个不停
You don't see me bitchin' about somebody spittin' in my grits.

71
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,320
副艇长要你们打开柜锁
X.O. wants these coffin lockers open.

72
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,090
打开它们
Open 'em up.

73
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,320
列队出来
Now file out.

74
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,010
科瓦尔斯基
Kowalski.

75
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,600
手里拿的是什么
What do you got there?

76
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,500
是牙套  水手长
It's a night guard, C.O.B.,

77
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,550
防止我磨牙
for my overbite.

78
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,520
瘾不小啊
Hey, Kurt Cobain.

79
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,470
你哪来的这东西
Where'd you get this?

80
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,030
我
I...

81
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,840
你在吸毒  你竟然在吸毒
You been using? You've been using!

82
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,850
你想要这垃圾吗
You want this junk?

83
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,570
你想要这玩意吗
You want this? Huh?!

84
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,870
-不  -你哪弄来的
- No! - Where'd you get it?

85
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,890
唯一知道你还活着的
The only two people who know you're still alive

86
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:17,690
就是站在你面前的两个人
are the two you're looking at.

87
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:18,690
你应该庆幸
And that's lucky for you.

88
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,420
我知道有好几个海豹突击队员想向你"问好"
I know a couple of navy SEALs that would love to come say hi.

89
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,300
我艇上的叛徒是谁
Who's the traitor on my boat?

90
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,450
我以为你们会先问我的名字
Here I thought you were gonna start with my name.

91
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,830
我叫布斯
It's Booth.

92
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,970
布斯
Booth?

93
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,400
好的  布斯
Okay,Booth.

94
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,040
我们知道在袭击中有人协助你
We know you had assistance during the attack.

95
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,950
我们想知道你的同伙是谁
We want to know who you're working with.

96
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,390
得了吧  艇长
Come on, captain.

97
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,010
你一定听到过流言
You must have heard the rumors.

98
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,900
艇长中间一直有传言说
The word among sub captains for a while

99
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,450
中情局在每艘核潜艇上都安插了休眠者
has been that the CIA has a sleeper agent on every nuclear sub...

100
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,440
以防哪个艇长发疯生出糊涂念头
just in case some crazy captain gets the wrong idea.

101
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,380
不管是你艇员中的哪位
And whoever it is in your crew,

102
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,320
从你们问题的急迫程度判断
judging from the urgency of the question,

103
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,800
我猜他们得手了
I guess they pulled it off.

104
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,420
得手了什么
Pulled off what, exactly?

105
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,690
他们的任务
Their mission.

106
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,190
就是你脖子上的发射钥匙
The firing key from around your neck.

107
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:03,230
看来我说中了
I see I'm right.

108
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,190
那么你是中情局的人
So that's who you're with... CIA?

109
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,420
心里不好过吧
Hell of a feeling, isn't it?

110
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,240
享受午餐吧
Enjoy your lunch,

111
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,820
因为我会让你烂在这里
because I will keep you here

112
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,930
你除了自己的心跳呼吸什么都听不到
where you can hear your breath and your heartbeat and nothing else

113
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,100
直到你供出那个人
until you give me a name.

114
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,080
信息隔离  艇长 
Compartmentalization, captain.

115
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,360
我怎么会知道
Why would I know?

116
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,240
你可以再来拷问我
You can torture me again,

117
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,980
可是我不知道他的名字
but I don't know a name,

118
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,950
不认得面孔
a face,

119
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,870
连声音都没听过
or even a voice.

120
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,640
或许他在撒谎
Well, maybe he's lying.

121
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,670
我很怀疑
I doubt it.

122
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,830
但是还有一个人可能知道
But there is one other person who may know.

123
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,320
你该多派些守卫
You should post more guards.

124
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,350
为什么  我又不怕什么
Why? I have nothing to fear.

125
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,070
你协助外来者使用军用药品
You aided foreigners in an attack on this island

126
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,730
攻击了这座岛
using a military drug.

127
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,080
水手长
C.O.B.

128
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,530
开始搬  东西全都装箱
Tear it apart. Load everything up in boxes.

129
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:15,530
遵命  长官
Yes, sir.

130
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,820
袭击中有人偷了我一件很重要的东西
Something I value greatly was taken from me during the attack.

131
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,400
如果你能告诉我它的下落
If you can tell me where to find it

132
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,150
或者是谁偷的  这事一笔勾销
or who took it, we're good.

133
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:25,110
否则  我艇上有28枚巡航导弹
If not, I do have 28 cruise missiles on my boat.

134
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,970
巡航导弹
Cruise missile?

135
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,160
我受过的威胁不少
I've been threatened with many things,

136
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,300
巡航导弹倒是头一回
but never a cruise missile.

137
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,070
装上卡车
Put 'em on the truck.

138
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,400
回头再开箱
We'll open 'em later.

139
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,730
搜他的身
Search him.

140
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,550
上次我在这里  任由他摆布
Last time I was here, he was the one in control.

141
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,920
我更喜欢这样
I like it this way better.

142
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,730
在看什么
What are you looking at?

143
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,560
你的后颈
The back of your neck.

144
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,230
我喜欢你把头发扎起来
I like your hair up.

145
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,450
披着头发拿的小费多
I make better tips with it down.

146
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,910
泡酒吧的男人喜欢认为给他倒酒的女人
Guys in bars like to think the girls pouring their drinks

147
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,170
入杯中烈酒般热情奔放
are free spirits.

148
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:07,120
那样的话  如果他们的甜言蜜语够动听
That way, if they say something interesting enough,

149
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,020
酒吧女就会跟他们上床
they'll hop into bed with them.

150
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,340
多么愚蠢  你能想象吗
Can you imagine such stupidity?

151
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,970
我可以帮你埋葬你的朋友
I can help you bury your friends.

152
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,310
我不介意
I don't mind.

153
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,940
只能我和霍普去
Gotta be just me and Hopper.

154
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,800
去埋了你的朋友  然后回来
Go bury your friends. Come back.

155
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,290
我关掉酒吧
I'll--I'll close down the bar.

156
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:36,010
我们喝个大醉  朝天开枪
We'll drink ourselves stupid and fire guns in the air,

157
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,250
你想怎样就怎样
whatever you like.

158
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,520
你真了解我
You're good for me.

159
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,310
那不好吗
That's a problem?

160
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,590
只是还不习惯
Just not used to it.

161
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,890
你到底是谁  你来这里想干什么
Who are you? What are you doing here?

162
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:22,860
说话
Tell me.

163
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,550
说啊
Tell me!

164
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,690
这是干什么
What is all this?

165
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,570
我们得把塞拉特的东西存起来
We had to store Serrat's stuff somewhere.

166
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,100
所有地方都要搜
Everything has to be searched,

167
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,230
包括你的办公室
including your office.

168
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,860
你在搜我的东西
You're looking through my things?

169
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,350
不想解释一下你去塞拉特家做什么
You want to tell me what you were doing at Serrat's?

170
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:45,170
我去听音乐  那也不可以吗
I went to listen to music. Is that allowed?

171
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,920
你连我的电脑也搜了
Did you search my computer as well?

172
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,990
好吧  如果你要搜我的东西  请便
Okay, if you want to search me, go ahead.

173
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,000
我阻止不了你
I can't stop you.

174
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,650
但你知道我并没有参与
But you know I was not involved.

175
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,000
我看不透你
I don't know what you are.

176
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,070
不敢确定
Not for sure.

177
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,700
那么我们的感觉一致了
Well, maybe that makes two of us.

178
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,760
我知道你卖毒品给我的人
I know you're selling to my guys.

179
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,900
以后不许
No more.

180
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,800
听着  老家伙
Listen, old man,

181
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,250
想要货  就直说
you need something, you just ask.

182
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,500
不许向海军贩毒
Don't deal to navy.

183
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:45,460
政府一再强调  对巴基斯坦实施核打击
The nuclear attack on Pakistan... was the terrorist threat

184
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,780
是为了应付恐怖威胁
the government used to justify it--

185
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,430
确有其事还是只是借口
Was it real or was it just an excuse?

186
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,600
野心家编出来的幌子
A false flag to validate the first shot of a man

187
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,730
因为他做了总统  还想当皇帝
who wants to be an emperor, not a president.

188
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:57,950
却要你的潜艇和巴基斯坦平民来买单
And your boat and the citizens of that nation paid the price.

189
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,540
心满意足吧  你们是好人
Yeah, enjoy it, man. You're the good guys.

190
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,920
但纠结之处在于
But here's the twist--

191
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,350
我们也是
So are we.

192
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,050
你们杀了两个海豹突击队员  还敢自称好人
You killed two navy SEALs. You're the good guys?

193
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,980
我们尽力避免伤亡
We tried to avoid that.

194
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,240
我的小队负责抓住霍普
My team was just supposed to grab Hopper

195
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,960
休眠者负责偷你们艇长的钥匙
while the sleeper took your captain's key.

196
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,160
为什么要偷发射钥匙
Why steal the firing key?

197
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,080
为什么不联系外界  形成联盟
Why not reach out? Why not form an alliance?

198
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,770
你可以认为他是精于谋略
You may think he's some kind of chess master,

199
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,180
可是没人知道查普林到底是在作势
but nobody knows if Chaplin is just bluffing

200
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,910
还是真的疯了
or if he's actually insane.

201
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:20,910
无论哪种情况
Either way, it's too dangerous

202
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,770
让他带着17枚核弹逍遥在外都过于危险
to let him stay parked out here with 17 nukes.

203
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,870
你有没有看过他的海军医疗调查心理档案
Have you seen his N.S.M.R.L. psych profile?

204
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,030
知不知道他有愤怒问题
Do you know he has rage issues

205
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,400
和边缘型自恋型人格特质
and borderline narcissistic personality traits?

206
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,500
你知道还有谁有这种性格特点吗
You know who else he shares those traits with?

207
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,280
谁
Who's that?

208
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,840
卡扎菲  斯大林
Gadhafi, Stalin,

209
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,720
吉姆・琼斯[邪教首领]
Jim Jones.

210
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,060
以及丘吉尔  麦克阿瑟和巴顿将军
Churchill, Macarther, Patton.

211
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,820
布斯  你到底能不能帮我们回家
Look, Booth, can you help get us home or not?

212
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,490
山姆  我们不想让你们回家
We don't want you to come home, Sam.

213
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,930
科罗拉多号必须是反抗的象征
The "Colorado" needs to be the symbol of resistance.

214
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,710
我们需要你们留下  继续你们正在做的事
We need you to stay here, keep doing what you're doing.

215
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,350
不过不能由查普林领导
But not with Chaplin in charge.

216
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,460
我们要你来领导
We want you.

217
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,260
你可以跟我们合作
You we can work with.

218
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,590
你跟人合作的方式真有意思  布斯
You got a funny way of working with people, Booth.

219
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:04,490
你们在这里对抗  总统的位子就坐不长了
The president's not gonna last, not with you here.

220
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:05,500
情形对他不利
Everything's turning against him.

221
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,380
只要六个月  可能一年
I'm talking six months, maybe a year...

222
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,160
-不不不  -然后你就能
- No, no, no. - Then you can--

223
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,610
我不要等那么久
I'm not waiting that long.

224
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,980
如果克里斯蒂也在呢  如果我们把她带来
What if Christine was here? What if we brought her to you?

225
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,920
我可以做到那个的  山姆
I can make that happen, Sam.

226
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,310
你不再是我的老板了
You know, you're not my boss anymore.

227
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,860
我现在是你哥哥手下的人
I work for your brother now.

228
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,630
那你总该认识钱吧
You still know what this is?

229
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,970
我们这款产品是为国家安全局
We developed it for N.S.A.

230
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,520
监视国内情况设计的
domestic surveillance.

231
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,990
插入车内的USB接口
Plug it into the U.S.B. Port of the car.

232
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:49,160
20秒的时间  程序就会启动联结
Give it 20 seconds for the program to migrate.

233
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,660
之后  只要司机
After that, every time the driver

234
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,400
用车内免提打电话
makes a call through the hands-free,

235
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,800
电话就会被转接到这里
You get the call on this.

236
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,460
要进车里面的时候
Now as for getting into the car,

237
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,300
用这个
use that.

238
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,750
红外干扰器  2008年以后制造的汽车
Infrared scrambler-- unlocks 99% of automobiles

239
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,900
99%都能用这个解锁
manufactured after 2008.

240
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,480
难道不是你进车里面吗
I thought you would be the one getting into the car.

241
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,210
我只是给你送来技术工具
I'm just bringing you your own tech,

242
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,830
不是要跟你一起犯罪
Not committing a felony.

243
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,900
要让我去做  我开价可是高得很
For that, I'd need a lot more money,

244
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,220
而且我还得获得你哥哥的同意
and I'd have to clear it with your brother.

245
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,200
滚吧
Go.

246
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,560
求之不得
Pleasure.

247
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,270
人事档案情况
Personnel files?

248
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,410
核弹发射钥匙被偷的时候
There were 35 crew members on board

249
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,680
潜艇上有35名船员
when the launch key was stolen.

250
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,980
你觉得看这些能搞清楚是谁偷的吗
You think you can figure out who took it by reading these?

251
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,270
我觉得一个人的生活经历
I think the sum of a person's life

252
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,880
可以通过一些片段推测出来
can be deduced from its parts.

253
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:42,250
那个内鬼一定跟中情局保持着联系
The traitor must be communicating with Langley.

254
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,090
怎么做到的
How?

255
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,340
说实话  长官  我不知道
Honestly, sir, I don't know.

256
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,050
找回钥匙不是关键任务之一  副艇长
Finding the key is not a priority, X.O.

257
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,790
而是最关键任务
It's the priority.

258
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,450
而且记住了  你的钥匙也是他们的目标
And remember, your key is a target, too.

259
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,380
我要对艇员们实行宵禁
I'm instituting a curfew on the crew.

260
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,240
我知道失去钥匙
I understand what it means

261
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,660
意味着什么  长官  真的
to be without our launch key, sir, I do,

262
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,870
我也在马不停蹄地寻找着
and I am searching without rest.

263
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,080
但我们应该考虑一下艇员们的士气
But we need to start thinking about the morale of the crew here.

264
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,000
在恰当的时间和地点
There's a time and place

265
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,120
我们的确会考虑艇员们的士气
for taking the morale of the crew into consideration.

266
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,770
但现在  目前  我的潜艇上有个内鬼
But right now, right here, there is a traitor on my boat

267
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:08,350
让我们命悬一线
who has put us in a position of mortal weakness.

268
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,630
我们在一座岛屿上找一把钥匙
We are searching for a key on an island.

269
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,880
"海底捞针"也比不上这个
"Needle in a haystack" doesn't even come close.

270
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,210
但我会一直找下去  直到你叫停
But I will continue searching until you tell me to stop.

271
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,260
恕我冒犯  长官  但你得看看艇员们了
But with respect, sir, you need to start looking at the crew,

272
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,720
而不是光看档案
not just their files.

273
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,150
其实...
You know...

274
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,010
埋葬人的不只是我们
we're not the only ones putting people in the ground.

275
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,890
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

276
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,190
那队追杀我们的秘密行动组
That black-ops team that came after us.

277
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,040
海军今天早上把他们埋了
Navy buried them this morning.

278
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,300
是啊
Yeah.

279
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,040
4张棺材
Four graves.

280
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,370
那支队伍有多少人
How many were on that team?

281
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,740
那第5个秘密行动组的组员呢
Where's the fifth black op?

282
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:00,830
只有4个
There were four.

283
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,910
你们埋了4个  但是总共有5个人
No, you buried four, but there were five.

284
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,780
说明还有一个活着
One's still alive.

285
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,200
如果是这样  我会知道的
If that were true, I'd know.

286
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,000
艇长或副艇长会告诉我的
Captain or the X.O. would have told me.

287
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,650
你确定吗
You sure about that?

288
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,160
我们走吧  金
Let's go, King.

289
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,170
长官  有没有秘密行动组的人
Sir, did any of the black ops

290
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:23,830
在BZ袭击中幸存
survive the B.Z. Attack?

291
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,150
没有
No.

292
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,840
为什么这么问
Why do you ask?

293
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:30,610
鉴于你在找BZ  我忽然想到了而已  长官
Just thought it was relevant since you're searching for B.Z., sir.

294
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,120
你进步很快
You advanced rapidly.

295
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,890
你具体是怎么到我的艇上来就职的
How was it, specifically, you ended up on my boat?

296
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:40,000
我一直觉得是因为你要求我来
I always assumed it was because you asked for me.

297
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,810
或许我父亲动用了什么关系
Maybe my father pulled some strings.

298
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,130
我不知道  长官
I really don't know, sir.

299
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,780
我希望是因为我有能力
I like to think I'm best qualified,

300
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,330
我证明了自己
that I proved myself.

301
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,600
谢谢你  上尉
Thank you, lieutenant.

302
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:11,740
对不起  上尉
Sorry, lieutenant.

303
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,440
你背包里装的什么
I-- what's in the backpack?

304
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,550
没什么  长官
Nothing, ma'am.

305
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,250
你知道艇长执行了宵禁吧
You know the captain's implemented a curfew?

306
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,380
知道  长官  在那之前我们会回来的
Yes, ma'am, but we'll be back by then.

307
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,960
就是我和几个女孩们
It was just gonna be me and a couple of girls,

308
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,960
在熄灯号响起之前最后狂欢一下
blow off a little steam before lights out.

309
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:36,030
对不起  长官  我不应该这样的
I'm sorry, ma'am. I should know better.

310
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,160
去吧  就当你没见过我
Go. You didn't see me.

311
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,520
上尉
Uh... lieutenant?

312
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,430
怎么了  科泰兹
What is it, Cortez?

313
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,560
你现在忙着吗
You doing anything right now?

314
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:08,690
我警告过你
I warned you.

315
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,320
你告诉你的...
You tell your...

316
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,400
朋友们
friends...

317
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,540
你的老大
Your boss...

318
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,450
以及你的孩子们
And your kids...

319
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,590
不许对海军贩毒
Don't deal to the navy.

320
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,930
再有下次  子弹就打进你的脑袋里
Next time, these go in your head.

321
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,100
你可以不用假装查看推特消息了  辛克莱小姐
You can stop pretending to check your twitter, Ms. Sinclair.

322
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,360
海军上将不会来了
The admiral isn't coming.

323
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:34,410
你是谁
Who are you?

324
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,710
福雷斯特
Forrest.

325
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,660
我是他的朋友
I'm a friend of his.

326
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,780
现在也是你的朋友
And a friend of yours now.

327
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,480
我不知道你在胡说些什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

328
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,780
谢帕德上将已经入狱了
Admiral Shepard is in jail,

329
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,230
而且是严格禁止探视的那种密牢
and not the kind where they have visiting hours.

330
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,740
你知道阿曼达・斯昭吗
Do you know Amanda Straugh?

331
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,160
白宫高级顾问  生前喜欢威士忌
White house senior advisor, loved scotch,

332
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,770
上周飞越太平洋时死于空难当中
died last week in a plane crash over the Pacific.

333
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,540
并非如此
Not exactly.

334
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,820
斯昭在圣玛丽娜岛谈判时遭枪击身亡
Straugh was shot and killed during negotiations on Sainte Marina.

335
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,480
总统有问题
The president has a problem.

336
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,940
他说这个女人的尸体葬身海底
He says this woman's body is at the bottom of the ocean.

337
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,230
如果这张照片通过媒体公之于众
If this photo were to show up on the news,

338
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,190
民众们就会知道他撒了谎
millions would know he's lying about it.

339
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,480
他们可能会开始疑心他还撒了别的什么谎
They might start wondering what else he's lying about.

340
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,180
等等  等等  我以为我们在说的是
Wait, wait, wait. I thought we were talking about

341
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,580
我们撒过的最成功的谎
the best lies we ever pulled off.

342
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,400
我可没有这样的黑历史
I don't have any of those.

343
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,590
我可是一直全A优等生
You are looking at a straight-A,

344
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,680
从没作过弊  从没惹过麻烦
never cheated, never got in trouble.

345
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,000
真可悲  不过是事实
Sad, but true.

346
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,580
好吧  刚刚那是谎言
Okay, all that was a lie.

347
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:31,990
你呢  谢帕德上尉
What about you, Lieutenant Shepard?

348
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:35,010
她们得到的A再多也没你多吧
Yeah, they don't make 'em more straight-A than you.

349
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,060
我挺随意的
Well, I'm relaxing.

350
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,690
是吗  你的表情可不像啊  上尉
Yeah? Then start looking relaxed, Lieutenant.

351
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,650
那些只不过是矿物样本
They're just mineral samples.

352
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,350
你和塞拉特拥有一样的小瓶
You and Serrat have the same vials.

353
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,890
我不知道你去他那里分享什么秘密
You were at his place sharing I don't know what.

354
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,710
我没必要向你报告
I don't have to answer you.

355
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:04,620
不  你必须告诉我
Yes, you do.

356
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:07,320
不然呢  你要像打那个男人一样打我吗
Or what, you'll hurt me like you hurt that man?

357
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,690
-当时我意识不清醒  -得了吧
- That wasn't me. - Oh, come on.

358
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,960
嘿  你干嘛呢
Hey, what are you doing?

359
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:14,880
看看这个
Look at this.

360
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,790
不  快关掉
No, turn it off.

361
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,900
不  不  不
No. No, no, no.

362
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,240
你看我像是很享受的样子吗
Does it look like I'm enjoying this?

363
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:18,760
好了  快关掉
Okay, turn it off.

364
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,220
不  不  不  不
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

365
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,450
-你看我像是很喜欢这样吗  -山姆
- Does it look like I want this? - Sam.

366
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,710
一切都会好起来的  我保证
Everything's gonna be different now, I promise.

367
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,910
别说了
Stop it.

368
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:26,730
这是什么
What's this?

369
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,300
无论我走多远  总会回到你身边
I always find my way back, don't I?

370
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,640
在我入军校之前
Well, before I went into the academy,

371
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,020
我曾经替别人参加过高考
I-I took the S.A.T.s for someone else.

372
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,500
那女孩  她真的很聪明
You know, the girl-- the girl was really smart,

373
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,550
但是她一进考场就犯晕
but she just couldn't take tests.

374
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,990
她患有焦虑症
You know, she had this anxiety disorder,

375
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,940
她们家很穷
and her family had no money,

376
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,450
所以  如果她拿不到奖学金
So if, uh, she didn't get a scholarship,

377
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,270
她就上不了大学
she couldn't go to college.

378
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:00,150
所以我就冒充了她的身份  替她考了
So I copied her I.D. and took the test.

379
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:03,050
我觉得现在已经过了诉讼时效了
I think the statute of limitations has passed.

380
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,730
敬诉讼时效
To the statute of limitations.

381
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,620
我能问你一些事吗  科泰兹
Can I ask you something, Cortez?

382
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,860
当然  长官
Yes, ma'am.

383
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,490
之前在塞拉特那里是怎么回事
What happened with Serrat?

384
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,960
你跟瑞德和约什在那里被关押了几天
You were locked in that room with Red and Josh for days.

385
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,030
发生什么事了
What happened?

386
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,230
我知道大家都认为我做了什么
I know what everyone thinks I did.

387
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,260
但我没有
But I didn't.

388
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,040
我答应过他  做他的耳目  
I promised him I'd be his eyes and ears

389
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,390
前提是他让我们活下来
if he'd let us live.

390
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,810
向他报告潜艇上的情况
Tell him what was going on with the sub.

391
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,090
几小时后  他杀了瑞德
A few hours later, he killed Red.

392
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,230
约定也就失效了
Deal was off.

393
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,330
你会那样做吗
Would you have?

394
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,980
当个叛徒吗
Been a traitor?

395
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:49,430
我曾养过一只狗
I had a dog...

396
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,220
当时我还是个小孩
when I was a little kid,

397
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,450
有一天  它反了  咬了我
And one day, it turned on me, bit me.

398
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:58,390
我爸爸  射杀了它
My dad... shot it.

399
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,510
他说  如果小狗反了  你永远不能再信任它
Said once a dog turns on you, you never trust it again.

400
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,650
唯一的办法就是弄死它
Only thing to do is put it down.

401
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,300
对待叛徒也一样
Same with a traitor.

402
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,340
克里斯蒂  你想让美国人民
Christine, what would you like the American people

403
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,110
知道你丈夫的什么情况
to know about your husband?

404
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,680
政府一直称我丈夫为恐怖分子
The administration keeps calling my husband a terrorist.

405
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,690
那他们为何还想与他和谈
But then why were they trying to negotiate with him?

406
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,890
又为何对和谈内容高度保密
And why are they keeping those negotiations such a secret

407
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,170
甚至不惜捏造阿曼达・斯昭的死亡一事
that they had to lie about Amanda Straugh's death?

408
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:30,510
你这是相当严重的指控
You're making some very serious allegations.

409
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,670
这看上去像是空难造成的吗
Does this look like a plane crash?

410
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:41,020
阿曼达・斯昭被政府自己人枪击
Amanda Straugh was shot by one of the government's own people,

411
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,060
而白宫试图掩盖这一真相
and the white house is trying to cover it up,

412
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,940
正如同他们试图掩盖关于
Just like they are trying to cover up the truth

413
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,250
我丈夫和美军舰科罗拉多号的真相一样
about my husband and the U.S.S. "Colorado."

414
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,030
多谢  女人
Thank you, mama.

415
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,120
谁把你打成这样的
Who did this to you?

416
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,280
你觉得呢
Who do you think?

417
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,410
好了  全体注意  集合
All right. Listen up. Fall in.

418
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,900
所有人  集合
Everybody, fall in.

419
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:28,180
都站好了  快点  立正
Tighten it up. Let's go. Lock it down.

420
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,970
别发牢骚了  赶紧来集合
Stop your bellyaching and fall in here.

421
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:44,190
中尉看见一个小男孩坐在路边
So the Junior l.T. sees this little boy sitting on the sidewalk...

422
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,780
玩着一堆粪便
playing with a pile of manure.

423
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,640
中尉就问小男孩
The L.T. asks the little boy,

424
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,430
"你玩这堆粪便干什么呢"
"What are you doing playing with that manure?"

425
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:55,930
小男孩说  "我在做军士"
Little boy says, "I'm building an N.C.O."

426
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,260
上尉跑回总部
L.T. runs back to company H.Q.,

427
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,540
找来长官  长官也问小男孩

428
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,890
"孩子  你为什么玩一堆粪便呢"
"Son... why are you playing with a pile of manure?"

429
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,160
小男孩说  "我在造军士"
Little boy says, "I'm building an N.C.O."

430
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,860
长官又去找来水手长
Chief goes and gets the C.O.B.,

431
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,890
水手长也过去问小男孩
who goes back to the little boy.

432
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,240
"孩子  你  你..."
"Hey, kid, what are you-- what--what--

433
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,760
"你玩粪便干什么"
"what are you doing playing with that manure?"

434
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,890
小男孩说
Little boy says...

435
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,560
"我在造军士"
"I'm building an N.C.O."

436
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,850
"你为什么要造军士"
"Why are you building an N.C.O.?"

437
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:26,560
小男孩顿了顿说  "长官  因为
Little boy pauses and says, "Because, sir,

438
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,210
"我便便不够用  造不了长官"
"I don't have enough crap to build an officer."

439
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:33,790
你们知道培养一个西点军校学生
What do you get when you breed

440
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,770
和一个陆军能得到什么吗
a West Point Cadet and a groundhog?

441
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,190
能多踢六周的烂橄榄球
Six more weeks of bad football.

442
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,230
为什么陆军的橄榄球队
How come the army football team

443
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,820
场外不提供冰了
doesn't have ice on the sidelines?

444
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,770
因为知道怎么做的人毕业了
The guy with the recipe graduated.

445
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,710
对  就是这样
That's right.

446
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,180
就是这样  大家听着
That's right. Now listen up.

447
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,930
大家听着  听着
Listen up! Listen up! Listen up!

448
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:54,100
我知道最近大家经历了很多事
I know we've put you through a hell of a lot lately.

449
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,580
我能跟你们说的就是  那是有原因的
And all I can tell you-- it's for a good reason.

450
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:58,700
但是
But...

451
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,970
现在我命令你们
I hereby order you...

452
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,670
尽情享受91年陆海两军橄榄球赛
to enjoy the 1991 army/navy football game.

453
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,900
先剧透一下  陆军输了
Spoiler alert-- the crunchies don't win.

454
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,550
快点来  快点来
There you go. There you go. There you go.

455
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,230
大家一起来
There you go. There you go. There you go.

456
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:20,060
有你们这样的艇员
You are the best crew

457
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,510
副艇长真是三生有幸
an X.O. could have the honor of leading.

458
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,030
谢谢大家  我很感激
Thank you, and I appreciate it.

459
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,280
海军  海军
Navy! Navy!

460
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,620
长官  给你拿了瓶啤酒
Sir. Brought you a beer,

461
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,550
如果你想喝的话
if you want it.

462
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,250
谢谢
Thank you.

463
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,310
你应该回去和其他人一起看比赛
You should go back and watch the game with the crew.

464
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,350
我只是...
I just...

465
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,580
我只是想说明一下
I just wanted to state, for the record,

466
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,710
我会一直支持你  艇长
that I'm with you, captain,

467
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,360
绝不改变
all the way...

468
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,420
无论何时
whenever you need me.

469
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,270
科泰兹  谢谢
Cortez, thank you.

470
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:34,130
但是你不应该单独找我
But you should not seek me out alone.

471
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,480
我们都必须遵守规章程序
There's an order and a morality that we both have to follow.

472
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,910
可是现在一切都变了  艇长
Well, it seems like everything's changed, captain.

473
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,360
并不是一切
Not everything.

474
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:51,760
明白吗
Understood?

475
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,950
你拿着什么  山姆
What do you got there, Sam?

476
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,000
是你们
Oh, boy.

477
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,840
你在耍我吗
Are you kidding me?

478
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,970
当然是  你们抓住的那个人
Sure. I mean, the guy you got in there

479
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,870
杀了我两个兄弟
killed two of my pals.

480
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:34,370
所以是应该给瓶冰啤奖励一下
So why not let him enjoy a cold one?

481
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:35,950
我需要知道他知道的情况
I need to know what he knows.

482
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,530
那我们三个目标一样
Yeah, that makes three of us.

483
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:41,550
别多管闲事
Stand down.

484
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:43,820
让我们做我们想做的
Let us do what we do.

485
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,830
搞定之后  我们给他在丛林里好好安葬他
When we're done, we got a nice resting place for him out in the jungle.

486
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,950
听我说  我一直在做他的工作
Listen to me. I've been working him.

487
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,710
我已经快建立起信任了
I'm building trust and I'm close.

488
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,750
所以现在你要一边待着
So right now you gotta back off

489
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,050
让我善始善终
and let me finish what I started.

490
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:54,270
你觉得他知道什么
What do you think he knows?

491
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,910
我觉得他知道怎么让大家回家
I think he knows how to get us all home.

492
00:24:59,110 --> 00:24:59,660
行了  金
Come on, King.

493
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,030
这家伙是个行外人  我们走
This guy's an amateur. Let's go.

494
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:04,540
不  霍普  我们让步
No, Hop. We fall back.

495
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,620
这个人暂时归副艇长
X.O.'s got this one. For now.

496
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,010
你睡眠怎么样
How are you sleeping?

497
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,590
不好吗
Not good?

498
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,040
想知道你妻子睡眠如何吗
Wonder how your wife's sleeping?

499
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:30,290
美国联合特种作战司令部给你看了克里斯蒂的资料
So what, J.S.O.C. gave you the download on Christine,

500
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,830
所以你就以为你了解我了吗
and now you think you know me?

501
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:34,730
不  他们给我看了你的资料
No. They gave me the download on you--

502
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:38,940
朝鲜  指着你的头的枪  扣动扳机声  
North Korea, the gun to your head, the click.

503
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,510
我知道你一直在自责
I know you can't stop blaming yourself

504
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,710
那七个人的死
for those seven men who died

505
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,490
才换得你能回家
so you could make it back home.

506
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,290
可是现在马库斯又把你送进监狱了
Now Marcus has landed you in prison again.

507
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,650
你的行为是值得肯定
Yeah, it's beautiful,

508
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:50,270
但是  还是面对现实吧
but... let's be real about what it is.

509
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:54,340
你愿意为那个人付出多少
How much are you willing to give that man?

510
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,570
休眠者肯定会用安全的无线电频道
Your sleeper will be communicating with Langley

511
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,360
和兰利总部联系
by a secure radio channel,

512
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,740
也就是说岛上有处通讯点
which means there's a comm site somewhere on this island.

513
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:06,130
找到通讯点就能抓住休眠者
Find that site, you'll have him.

514
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,960
这么说
Now...

515
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,950
你准备好自力更生了
You ready to start helping yourself?

516
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,170
如果我们要这么做的话
If we were to do this,

517
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:19,860
具体要怎么办
how would we do it?

518
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,580
很简单地诱捕
Simple snatch and grab.

519
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:25,140
让马库斯远离众人的视线  但是好好对待他
Marcus will be kept out of sight, but treated well

520
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,150
你控制这里
while you run things here

521
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:28,380
逼迫白宫那边换人掌权
forcing a change of guard at the White House.

522
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:31,840
然后让新政府安排一次特赦
Then the new administration arranges for amnesty...

523
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,440
赦免你们所有人
for all of you.

524
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,150
秘密行动组的第五个人还活着
That fifth black op is alive.

525
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:54,820
艇长和副艇长把他锁起来了
Your captain and your X.O. are keeping him locked away.

526
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:01,800
你总是课堂上第一个举手的  是吧
Bet you always raised your hand first in class, didn't you?

527
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,320
别过来
No, stop!

528
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,610
别走近我
Don't come near me.

529
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,260
大家都离她远一点
Everybody keep away from her!

530
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,600
巡航导弹

531
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,270
斯奈德  保持冷静
Snyder, you need to stay calm.

532
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,570
是定时炸弹
It's on a timer.

533
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,650
还剩多少时间
How much time is left?

534
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,940
我不知道  快点弄走
I don't know. Take it off.

535
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,580
-快点从我身上弄走  -不行
- Just take it off of me. - I can't.

536
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,070
线路绕着皮带扣
It's wired to the buckle.

537
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:47,940
你得尽量不要哆嗦
You gotta stop shaking.

538
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,240
我尽力了
I'm trying.

539
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,360
再努把力
Try harder.

540
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,320
冷静下来  没事的
Hey, calm down. It's okay.

541
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,690
有我们在
We got you.

542
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,870
还剩多少时间
How much time is left on it?

543
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,580
很多
Plenty.

544
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,060
快把它从我身上弄下来
Just take it out from me.

545
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,700
好了  好了
Okay, okay.

546
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,080
怎么回事
What happened?

547
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,870
没事  没事的  放心
Hey, nothing. It's okay. It's okay.

548
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:18,810
格蕾丝
Grace.

549
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:24,050
格蕾丝  我需要照明
Grace, I need eyes.

550
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:30,990
拿着  好了
Here. Okay.

551
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:36,710
现在我要拔出红线  但不能碰到黄线
Now I gotta get that red wire without touching the yellow.

552
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,510
能帮我摁住那根线吗
Can you keep the lead away?

553
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:41,630
黄色的那根
The yellow lead.

554
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:17,380
时间到了
Time's up.

555
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:30,490
你是不是疯了
Are you out of your mind?

556
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,810
白宫的律师给我打电话
I have White House lawyers calling me

557
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:33,480
说你今天接受了录像采访
about this interview you taped today.

558
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,930
这完全有违我对你的叮嘱
You did the exact opposite of what I told you.

559
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:37,470
那个记者说这么做也许会有用
The reporter said that maybe it would help.

560
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,640
记者为了拿到消息什么话都会说
The reporter's gonna say whatever gets her the story!

561
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,230
还有你从哪儿搞到的阿曼达・斯昭的照片
And where the hell did you get this picture of Amanda Straugh?

562
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,490
有人把它放进我信箱里了
Somebody put it in my mailbox.

563
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,360
有人放进你信箱里  你有没有搞错
Somebody put it in your mailbox? What is wrong with you?

564
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,850
别冲我吼  你没资格冲我吼
Stop yelling at me! You don't get to yell at me.

565
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:49,860
我已经尽力做到最好了
I am doing the best that I can here.

566
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:52,490
你知道我要承受多大的压力吗
Do you understand how much pressure I am under?

567
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,020
我一个人面对这一切
I am all alone here,

568
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,400
自己的丈夫在外面
and my husband is out there somewhere,

569
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,430
随时都有可能丧命
about to get killed at any second.

570
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,090
你说得对  是我的错
You're right. It's my fault.

571
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,710
我应该看着你的
I should've kept an eye on you.

572
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:04,070
抱歉
I'm sorry.

573
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,390
我只是...
It's just, um...

574
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,420
那些感觉一下子全涌上来了
It's all just starting to get to me...

575
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,380
空荡荡的家  一个人睡
The empty house, the sleeping alone,

576
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,630
更何况我根本睡不着
except I can't even sleep

577
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,410
-破水龙头老是滴个不停  -冷静下来
- because the damn faucet won't stop dripping. - Hey, hey, calm down.

578
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,450
一切都会好的
It's all gonna be fine.

579
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,570
我帮你看看水龙头吧
Why don't I take a look at the faucet?

580
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,380
我需要一把长头钳
I'm gonna need, uh, long-nose pliers for this.

581
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,630
汽车后备箱里有工具包
I got a tool kit in the trunk.

582
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,200
什么  等一下
What? Wait.

583
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,980
我马上就回来
I'll be right back.

584
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:52,020
听着...
Look...

585
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,750
很抱歉今天让你失望了
I'm sorry that I disappointed you today.

586
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,850
现在只有你一个人还在帮我
You are the only one that's left that's fighting for me.

587
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,030
没有你我不知道该怎么办
I don't know what I'd do without you.

588
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,850
不  不行
No, no.

589
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,070
对不起
I-I'm sorry.

590
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:23,150
是我的原因吗
Was it just me?

591
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:25,110
不知道  我只是做不到
I don't know. But it can't be me.

592
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:32,410
我现在心里乱糟糟的
Look, I'm having very confusing feelings right now

593
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:36,830
你能...再给我一段时间吗
and... can you just be patient with that?

594
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,060
当然
Of course.

595
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:53,770
你很厉害
You were good.

596
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,080
你也是
So were you.

597
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:10,050
什么  怎么了
What? What?

598
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,690
一直想看你长发的样子
Been wondering what that looks like.

599
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,840
只此一次
One time thing.

600
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,240
当然
Sure.

601
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,020
谢谢
Thanks.

602
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,110
也谢谢你
Thank you.

603
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,130
他人呢
Where is he?

604
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,960
找我吗
Where am I?

605
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,070
看来你还不清楚自己该找谁
I don't think you know what you are looking for.

606
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:29,410
把他带上来
Bring him.

607
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,430
我猜你是在找
I presume you are looking for the man

608
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:33,480
往你的人身上绑炸弹的人吧
who strapped a bomb to one of your people?

609
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,960
我听说了
I just heard.

610
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,850
看见没
You see?

611
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:39,050
我把他抓来了
I caught him for you.

612
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:39,950
我是来找你的
I came for you.

613
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:42,170
我  是啊  你可以把我带走
Uh, me. Yeah, yeah, you could take me,

614
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:43,890
但是大家不会同意的
but the people won't allow it

615
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:46,450
因为我是他们的朋友  他们爱我
Because I'm their friend, and they love me.

616
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,070
他们知道我是清白的
And they know I have done nothing.

617
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,630
是这个人绑的炸弹
This is the man responsible for your bomb.

618
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,500
可悲啊
It's sad.

619
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:54,220
他想让我对他另眼相看
He thought it would impress me.

620
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,180
告诉他
Tell him.

621
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,970
都是我的注意
It was my idea.

622
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:59,590
是我一个人干的
I did it. Just me.

623
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,640
你们应该感谢我帮忙抓到了他
You should be grateful I brought this man to justice.

624
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,130
我会合理处置他的
I will deal with him appropriately.

625
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:13,360
不用了  我来
No. I will.

626
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:17,590
这个人已经承认
This man has admitted

627
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,100
蓄意屠杀我军人员的罪名
to the attempted mass murder of my crew.

628
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,660
再敢挑衅我
Try me again,

629
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,660
我会做你的法官  陪审员并亲自了结你
and I will be your judge, jury, and executioner.

630
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,090
克里斯蒂
Christine.

631
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:33,490
有人给他打电话
Someone's calling him.

632
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:38,400
已连接

633
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,060
喂
Hello.

634
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,620
我是科利  有什么新消息
This is Curry. What do you have?

635
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:39,870
到底是怎么回事
What the hell's going on?

636
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:42,250
有人把照片放进她信箱里了
Somebody put the photo in her mailbox,

637
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,690
说明是白宫里有人走漏了风声
which means you've got a leak in the White House,

638
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:46,160
你不要再说是我没看住她了
so you can stop blaming me for not keeping her in line.

639
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:49,080
听着  我不想再干下去了
And look, I don't want to do this anymore.

640
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,350
你还想不想见丹尼尔了
Do you want to see Daniel again?

641
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,470
当然想
Of course I do.

642
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,530
他是我儿子
He's my son.

643
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,680
我想说的是  你已经把她逼入绝境了
All I'm saying is, you've got her in an impossible situation.

644
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,180
还能指望她怎么做呢
What do you expect her to do?

645
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:00,920
让我给她点儿线索
Let me throw her a line.

646
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,660
一切按原计划行事
Just stick to the plan

647
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,190
别太入戏了  保罗
and don't get too attached, Paul.

648
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:06,190
情况变化无常
The parameters can always change.

649
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,580
再联系
I'll check in later.

650
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,110
山姆
Sam.

651
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,460
发生的这些事真疯狂  对吧
Everything that happened was crazy, right?

652
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,680
他们给我们下药  我们都中毒了
They drugged us. The B.Z. Affected us all.

653
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:25,900
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

654
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,390
只有美国人才会为一个吻道歉
Only an American would apologize for a kiss.

655
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,490
我不是和塞拉特共事
I'm not working with Serrat.

656
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:38,140
我只是在还我前男友的债
I am paying a debt my ex-boyfriend had.

657
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:42,070
塞拉特雇他从这里土壤中检查稀有矿物
Serrat paid him to test the soil here for rare earth minerals.

658
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,270
那些就是土壤样本
That's what the samples were for.

659
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:49,830
这座岛很值钱
This island-- it is worth a lot of money.

660
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:51,470
好的
Okay.

661
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,790
我只是想
I wanted you to know

662
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:55,290
让你知道我没有骗你
so you would not think I lied to you.

663
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:58,130
但你得替我保密
But I need you to promise me you will keep it secret,

664
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,720
不仅仅对塞拉特
and not only from Serrat.

665
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,640
对任何人都保密
From everybody.

666
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,650
我现在没法向你作任何承诺
I can't promise you anything right now.

667
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,410
好吧
Okay.

668
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,340
那是你的决定
That can be your choice,

669
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:11,810
但你现在知道我不会欺骗你
but... now you know that I will not lie to you.

670
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,710
这是我的决定
That's my choice.

671
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,090
放松  放松
All right, easy now. Easy now.

672
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:34,210
天啊
God--

673
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,490
你好啊
Hey.

674
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,130
你们是这座岛的囚犯
Your men are prisoners on this island.

675
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:45,230
你为何这么生气
Why are you so angry about them

676
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,120
他们只不过付钱给我让他们离开
paying me for a few hours of escape?

677
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,560
你凭什么觉得你可以控制别人
Why do you feel as though you can control what other people do?

678
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,240
你为什么这么害怕
Why are you so afraid?

679
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,450
我在世界很多地方都待过
I've lived all over the world.

680
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:55,360
你这种人我见多了
I've seen many men like you.

681
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:56,550
我觉得你想喝一杯吧
You have a thirst, I think.

682
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:59,780
你好哪一口
What is your particular poison?

683
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,260
海洛因  可卡因
Heroin? Cocaine?

684
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,480
不是  不是
No. No.

685
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,450
给你来点异域特色的
For you, something more exotic.

686
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,550
窒息性的
Apnoea?

687
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:09,920
羟甲唑啉
Oxy?

688
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:13,560
芬太尼
Fentanyl?

689
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:17,130
眼睛可不会说谎
The eyes don't lie.

690
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,830
你瞳孔刚才像这样  朋友
Your pupils just went like this, my friend.

691
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,280
我戒了
I kicked that--

692
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,100
我戒了很久了
I kicked that a long time ago.

693
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:23,900
都结束了
End of story.

694
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,120
是吗  像你这样的人
Oh, yeah. You know, for someone like you,

695
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,370
可没那么轻易的能摆脱这个  对吧
the story never really ends, does it?

696
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,370
这是强力止痛药  对吧
This is a powerful painkiller, yes?

697
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:31,760
我知道疼痛的感觉
I know pain.

698
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,120
你记得我母亲吗
You recall my mother?

699
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,440
我没那闲工夫
I haven't had the pleasure.

700
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:35,720
不不  你见过
Ah, but you have.

701
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,370
她只有一只胳膊
She's with one arm.

702
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:40,620
是的  是的  你当然见过过她
Yes. Yes, yes, surely, surely you noticed her.

703
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,120
我这么认为
Aah! Aah! Yes, I think.

704
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:44,720
知道吗  我还是孩子时
You see, when I was a boy,

705
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:46,540
有人闯进村子
some men came to my village.

706
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,710
他们想把我带进丛林里
They wanted to take me into the bush with them.

707
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,210
我母亲想去阻止他们
My mother tried to stop them.

708
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:51,430
放开我
Get 'em away from me!

709
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:52,730
她生我时只有十二岁
She was only 12 when I was born,

710
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,160
她是我母亲
so she was my mother,

711
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,860
但她更像我姐姐
but she was also like my sister.

712
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:58,710
那伙人跟我说
The men, they said to me,

713
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:01,760
他们说  "小子  你拿着这把大砍刀
they said, "You go take this machete now, eah bo.

714
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:05,210
"去把你妈的胳膊砍了否则我们就杀了她"
"You're going to chop off your mother's arm or we will kill her."

715
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,460
你能想象吗
Can you imagine?

716
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,330
我从那天起就成了战士
That was my first day as a soldier.

717
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,780
上帝啊
Aah! God!

718
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:36,380
我来帮你止痛
Now I'm going to take the pain away.

719
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,400
舒服了吧
Yes.

720
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,590
这个给你留着再疼的时候用
This is for when the pain comes back.

721
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,840
就是你啊  不就是你吗
You know it's you, you know it's you.

722
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,570
我们现在变成行刑者了吗
So we're executioners now?

723
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:52,570
别无选择
There's no other option.

724
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,810
你和布斯谈过有什么收获吗
Have your conversations with Booth borne fruit?

725
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:01,730
他说无论休眠者是谁
Well, he claims that whoever the sleeper agent is

726
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:03,870
在岛上肯定有通讯点
has a comm site on the island

727
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,480
方便与他上级联系
to communicate with their handlers.

728
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:07,830
他还说要想回去
He also claims that we're the resistance

729
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,630
最大的阻碍是我们
to what's going on back home.

730
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,130
他也许是对的
Maybe he's right.

731
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:17,710
我们不去找钥匙了
Okay. We stop looking for the key.

732
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,160
不再搜查船员
No more rousting the crew.

733
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:20,860
我们去找通讯点
We look for the comm site.

734
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:22,730
找到叛徒
We find the traitor,

735
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,000
就能找到钥匙
we find the key.

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,790
你去把有权力下达这个命令的人叫来
I'm not going to annihilate 4.3 million Pakistanis

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,410
否则我绝不会屠杀430万巴基斯坦国民
without hearing from someone whose authority I recognize.

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,960
自己人居然想击沉我们
Our own people tried to sink us?

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,180
我们接管了圣玛丽娜岛上的
We have commandeered the NATO early warning station

6
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,670
北约预警雷达站
on the island of Sainte Marina.

7
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,180
我宣布  这座岛周围
I am declaring a 200-mile

8
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,220
方圆两百英里的地区为无人地带
no-man's-land around this island.

9
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:19,610
若敢挑衅  我们便同归于尽
Test us, and we will all burn.

10
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,080
勿谓言之不预
You've been warned.

11
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,090
唯一知道你还活着的
The only two people who know you're still alive

12
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:23,960
就是站在你面前的两个人
are the two you're looking at.

13
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,760
你应该庆幸
And that's lucky for you.

14
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,210
我知道有好几个海豹突击队员想向你"问好"
I know a couple of navy seals that would love to come say hi.

15
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,260
那第5个秘密行动组的组员呢
Where's the fifth black op?

16
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:28,850
只有4个
There were four.

17
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:30,720
你们埋了4个  但是总共有5个人
No, you buried four, but there were five.

18
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,150
我的律师保罗・威尔斯
My lawyer Paul Wells,

19
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,550
他是山姆的至交  他一直都很棒
he's an old friend of Sam's, and he's been amazing.

20
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,960
不过他是政府派来监视我
But he's a government agent sent to spy on me

21
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,070
策反我跟山姆敌对的特工
and turn me against Sam.

22
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,790
插入车内的USB接口
Plug it into the U.S.B. port of the car.

23
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,010
只要司机用车内免提打电话
Every time the driver makes a call through the hands-free,

24
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,880
电话就会自动转接到这里
you get the call on this.

25
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,620
为什么要偷发射钥匙  为什么不联系外界
Why steal the firing key? Why not reach out?

26
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,540
为什么不形成联盟
Why not form an alliance?

27
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:47,860
艇长之间一直有传言说
The word among sub captains for a while

28
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,960
中情局在每艘核潜艇上都安插了休眠者
has been that the CIA has a sleeper agent on every nuclear sub.

29
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,960
以防哪个艇长发疯生出糊涂念头
Just in case some crazy captain gets the wrong idea.

30
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,910
休眠者肯定会用安全的无线电频道
Your sleeper will be communicating with Langley

31
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:56,690
和兰利总部联系
by a secure radio channel,

32
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,780
也就是说岛上有处通讯点
which means there's a comm site somewhere on this island.

33
00:00:58,780 --> 00:00:59,830
我们去找通讯点
We look for the comm site.

34
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:02,100
找到叛徒  就能找到钥匙
We find the traitor, we find the key.

35
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,730
好了  大家听着
All right. Listen up, people.

36
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,840
五天后  会有一艘船获许通过封锁区
In five days, a ship will be allowed through the blockade

37
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,080
把那些选择离开的人
to transport those of you who have elected to leave

38
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,450
送回美国
back to the States.

39
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,450
那艘船还会带来食物和物资
This ship will also be delivering food and provisions

40
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,810
一定比我们近期吃的豆子和大米好得多
a whole lot better than the beans and rice we've had lately.

41
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,100
太好了
Yeah!

42
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,890
我们也协商获得了24小时的探访时间
We've also negotiated a 24-hour visit

43
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,940
让你们可以和配偶家人团聚一下
with your spouses and family members.

44
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,260
稍后会跟大家再说说具体情况
I'll have more details shortly,

45
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,290
但是很多人会再次见到家人的
but many of you are gonna see your family again.

46
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,520
安德斯  虽然那不是回家
Hey, Anders, I know it's not going home,

47
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,470
但是至少你可以见一见你妻子
but at least you're gonna get to see your wife.

48
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,610
她不会来的
She's not gonna be on that ship.

49
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,390
你觉得呢
So what do you think?

50
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,410
我也不知道  有点美好的太不真实了
I don't know. It seems too good to be true, no?

51
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,950
政府正在不惜一切
The government is spinning every top on the table

52
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,450
获取良好的公关形象
to buy some good P.R..

53
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,190
你知道他们不会让克里斯蒂来的
You know they're not gonna let Christine come.

54
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,940
也不会让格蕾丝或者我的家人来
No one for Grace or me either.

55
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,370
对  他们想挑拨
Right. Well, they want to drive a wedge

56
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,140
长官和艇员之间的关系  是吧
between the officers and enlisted, yeah?

57
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,460
对  他们把我们归为一切麻烦的根源
Yeah, sure. They cast us as the cause of all their troubles,

58
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,950
让艇员们想到他们错过的天伦之乐
remind them what they're missing at home.

59
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,400
真是个高招  他们让我陷入了困境
It's a smart move, and they've got me in a bind.

60
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,690
你只要答应  他们就会高兴
You say "Yes," they look good.

61
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,790
你若不答应  那你就是个疯狂的混蛋
You say "No," you keep looking like the crazy bastard

62
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:12,070
对自己的艇员毫不关心
who doesn't give a damn about his crew.

63
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,060
正是如此
That's it.

64
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,460
长官
Hey, sir.

65
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,200
我们还缺一把发射钥匙
We're still down a launch key.

66
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,440
一旦发生争端  我们可毫无回击之力
This thing goes sideways, we're defenseless.

67
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,500
所有离开这里的人都要搜身
Everyone who leaves this place gets searched.

68
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,900
我们是少了一把钥匙
We may not have one of our keys,

69
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,170
但是我们不能让别人将此事告诉我们的敌人
but I'm not gonna let someone prove that to our enemies.

70
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,740
-好的  -中情局的那个朋友怎么样了
- Okay. - How's it going with our friend from the, uh, CIA?

71
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,570
六天以来  他就只见过我
I'm the only face he's seen for six days.

72
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:29,960
他喜欢跟我谈  所以...
And he likes to talk, so--

73
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,510
好  让他继续说下去  看看能发现什么
Okay. Keep him talking. See what you can find out.

74
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,140
一百年前  我们自给自足
A hundred years ago, we were self-sufficient.

75
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,360
我们的文化很单纯
Our culture was pure.

76
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,900
那正是吸引我回来的原因
That's what seduced me back to this island.

77
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,070
船上有足够的物资
There are enough provisions on the ship

78
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,410
可以让我们至少再维持一个月
to feed us all for at least a month.

79
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,830
一个月  塔妮
A month? Tani.

80
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,140
最近一磅面粉都涨到多少钱了
How much is a pound of flour going for these days?

81
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,690
抱歉  父亲  我不想掺和这件事
Sorry, father. I'm not letting you drag me into this.

82
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,910
你是不是需要帮助来对付塞拉特
Do you need help dealing with Serrat?

83
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,460
塞拉特从不对我的人找麻烦
Serrat leaves my people alone.

84
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,840
问题的根源是你们潜艇的到来
The problem begins and ends

85
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,430
也只有你们走了才算完
with that blockade of ships out there.

86
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,120
我一定会尽我所能
I will do everything in my power

87
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,550
处理好这个问题
to fix this.

88
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,040
要知道  你不能改变自己的本性
You know you can't fix what you are.

89
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,860
可能你是好意
And maybe your heart's in the right place,

90
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,380
但说到底  你们也不会比法国人好到哪里去
but finally, you're no better than the French

91
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,620
他们曾强占了这个小岛  
when they took this island 

92
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,390
攫取了一切值钱的东西
and raided it for anything of value.

93
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,520
确实是
That's true.

94
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,700
本性难移
We are who we are.

95
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,060
现在我们就在这里  这点是不会改变的
And now we're here, and that might not change.

96
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,040
所以
So...

97
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,440
你就得做出改变了
You might have to.

98
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,190
他们也不好过
This is hard for them, too.

99
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,860
你觉得一只脚踩在水里
How long do you think you can keep one foot in the water

100
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,540
另一只踩在岸上  能撑多久
and the other on the shore?

101
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:36,890
蚱蜢
Grasshopper.

102
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,600
-是短波信号  所有很难定位  -地震
- It's shortwave. It's very difficult to locate. - Earthquake.

103
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,040
-我能判断出来是在岛上...-一
- So I can tell you it's on the island... - One.

104
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,900
-但是无法判断具体地点  -好
- But I can't tell you where. - Okay.

105
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,130
三  飞机场
Three. Airport.

106
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,910
-二  -还有什么事需要我帮忙吗
- Two. - Anything else I can do for you?

107
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:47,640
-跳房子  -没有了  要是找到
- Hopscotch. - No. Just tell me

108
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,720
-关于信号的其它信息  告诉我就行了  -六
- when you find out more about the signal. - Six.

109
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,670
四
Four.

110
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,550
-书呆子  -好
- Bookworm. - OK.

111
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,070
五  六
Five. Six.

112
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,690
葡萄藤
Grapevine.

113
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,630
一
One.

114
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,380
蚱蜢
Grasshopper.

115
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,570
六  二
Six. Two.

116
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,250
地震
Earthquake.

117
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,470
我们国家有一个节日
We have a holiday in our country

118
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,430
庆祝两种文化的相遇
that celebrates the coming together of two cultures.

119
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,710
面对艰难困苦  两种不同文化的人
Faced with great hardship, these two very different groups

120
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,010
形成了一个团体
formed what could only be called a community

121
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,750
作为生存手段
as a means to survive.

122
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,930
如同错过家乡的诸多传统节日一样
And as with many of our traditions back home,

123
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,900
我们已经错过了感恩节
we've already missed our Thanksgiving.

124
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,990
但是今晚
But tonight,

125
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,830
秉承节日精神传统
in the spirit of that holiday,

126
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,110
我们共享一切
what's ours is yours.

127
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,150
干杯  干杯
Here, here.

128
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,660
什么比较好吃
So... what's good here?

129
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,020
跟昨天的差不多
Pretty much the same as yesterday.

130
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,460
就是些面条
Some kind of noodle.

131
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,360
不管怎样  选择面条总不会太糟糕的
Guess you can't really go wrong with noodles.

132
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,730
你不用这样
You don't have to do this.

133
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,600
哪样
Do what?

134
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,960
闲聊  增加自己的魅力指数
Chitchat. Turn on the charm.

135
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,420
我刚刚是在那样吗
Oh, that's what I was doing?

136
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,470
"什么比较好吃"
"What's good here"?

137
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,750
我是真想知道
It's an honest question.

138
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,160
听着  我们之间发生的事已经发生了
Look, what happened between us happened,

139
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,060
现在我们要回到之前的样子
and now we should just go back to the way things were,

140
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,570
你继续当混蛋  我努力做好本职工作
with you being a jackass and me trying to do my job.

141
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,310
没必要把事情搞得奇奇怪怪的
No need for things to get weird.

142
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,760
对  这一点都不奇怪
Right, 'cause this isn't weird at all.

143
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,400
我以为你现在和那个酒吧女孩在一起
Look, I thought you were with the girl from the bar anyway.

144
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,450
她叫什么
What's her name?

145
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,320
塔妮
Tani.

146
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,290
对
Yeah.

147
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,300
她人很好  而且像是真的喜欢你
She's nice and she really seems to like you.

148
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,100
你不说我也知道
It's been known to happen.

149
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:23,860
艇长
Captain.

150
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,340
索菲追踪到通讯点了
Sophie tracked the comm site.

151
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,930
休眠者似乎在过去三天使用过两次
Looks like the sleeper's used it twice in the last three days.

152
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,380
使用的这么频繁
That's one time too many.

153
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,220
那个人一定是感觉到紧张的局势了
Whoever it is must be feeling the heat.

154
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,600
布斯有吐露什么信息吗
What's Booth offering?

155
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,320
尚未开口
Nothing yet.

156
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,610
-你信任他吗  -不
- You trust him? - Nope.

157
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,460
-很好  继续关注他  -好的
- Good. Stay on him. - Okay.

158
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,060
一旦饿极了
Get hungry enough...

159
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:03,220
无味的军用补给粮也能吃出鹅肝的味道
even a hoo-ah bar tastes like damn foie gras.

160
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,800
你吃过鹅肝吗
You ever have foie gras?

161
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,050
就好像一个人把一块精选肉片
Like someone took a prime filet and...

162
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,410
变成了黄油
turned it into butter.

163
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:15,980
要说最好吃的鹅肝
Best foie gras I ever had

164
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,010
还得是那家澳门小酒馆做的
was at this little bistro in Macao.

165
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,580
那儿的中国人很喜欢法国菜
The Chinese positively love their French food.

166
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,280
该死  肯德尔  我以为我们都说清楚了
Damn, Kendal. I thought we were past all this.

167
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,440
听着  布斯
Listen, Booth,

168
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,980
那个无线站点最近十分活跃
that radio site, it's active.

169
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,250
偷钥匙的人一定在暗中和国内联系
Whoever stole our launch key is talking back to home.

170
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,120
想猜猜对方会下达什么命令吗
You want to guess what the orders are gonna be?

171
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,860
我不喜欢猜
Don't much like guessing.

172
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,890
第一  用炸弹炸死我们  一劳永逸
One, they bomb us all to hell and be done with it.

173
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,160
第二  休眠者狗急跳墙
Two, the sleeper gets desperate

174
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,430
背地里把我和马库斯都干掉
and me and Marcus each get a bullet behind the ear.

175
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,940
至于你
And you...

176
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,930
会饿死在这里  被人遗忘
you starve to death, forgotten out here.

177
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:46,870
第三
Three...

178
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,500
你选择信任我  我们共同合作
You trust me. We work this thing together.

179
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,170
你坐在这儿  净说些没用的废话
You sit there and you talk platitudes.

180
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,040
你告诉我  我是你理想的合作人选
You tell me I'm the man for your job.

181
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,620
但迄今为止你提供的信息
You haven't given me one single thing

182
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,500
没有一样能为我所用
I can actually use, not one.

183
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,620
没关系  我明白  我都明白
And that's fine. I get it. I get it.

184
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,650
你想把控制权握在手中
You want to be in control.

185
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,890
你想谨慎行事  处处防范
You want to play your hand tight.

186
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,330
直到现在  我都没找到信任你的理由
But right now, you've given me no reason to trust you.

187
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,910
你只是个在等待时机的杀手
You're still just a killer waiting for the moment

188
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,760
你希望劝服我放了你
You talk me out of those cuffs.

189
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,670
你得证明自己值得信任才行  布斯
You gotta make me trust you, Booth.

190
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,810
加油  加油
Come on! Come on!

No. See, I haven't pulled my cards yet. I'm gonna...

197
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,910
你昨晚没来啊
So you didn't come up last night.

198
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,190
他在哪儿
Where is he?

199
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,180
抓住他
Get him!

200
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,310
不知各位先生有何贵干
Can I help you gentlemen with something?

201
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,310
等等  他们是岛上的执法队
Wait. They're the law on the island.

202
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,080
出了什么事
What happened?

203
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,150
就是他
That's him.

204
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,560
-你们干什么  -等等  住手
- What? Whoa... - Wait! Wait! No! 

205
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,060
别伤害他
Don't hurt him.

206
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,010
放开我  放开...
Get off me! Get...

207
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,980
你到底是哪边的  普塔卡
Whose side are you on, Putaika?

208
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,490
我没犯事  救命
I didn't do anything wrong! Help!

209
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,990
救命啊
Help!

210
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,510
请你们立刻放下武器
Hey, lower your weapon right now!

211
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,760
放下武器
Lower your weapon!

212
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:23,950
放下武器
Lower your weapon!

213
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,590
谁能告诉我发生了什么事
Who wants to tell me what's going on here?

214
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,980
他们说你的手下将艾瑞塔
They're saying your man took Erita

215
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,910
掳进丛林里强奸了她
into the jungle and raped her.

216
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:30,900
告诉我这不是真的
Tell me that's not true.

217
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,930
我没有  艇长  我发誓  她在撒谎
I didn't do it, Captain! I swear. She's lying.

218
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,220
根据土法 
According to local laws, 

219
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,160
他将被砍100刀  以示惩戒
he'll be punished by caning a hundred cuts.

220
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:38,280
如果他侥幸存活  脖子上将被烙下烙印
If he survives, a brand will be burned into his neck

221
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,310
作为其所犯罪行的永久印记
as a permanent mark of the crime he committed.

222
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:42,300
-烙印  -老天  不能让他们这么做
- A brand? - Oh, my God. You can't let them do that to me.

223
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,230
马上把他放下来
Cut him down. Now.

224
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,580
此事与你无关  艇长
This is not your affair, Captain.

225
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,560
是我岛内的事物
This is an island matter.

226
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:46,680
把他放下来
Cut him down!

227
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:48,680
我们是有法规的
We have laws.

228
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,160
你这么做不合适
This isn't right.

229
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,140
也许很合适
Might is right.

230
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,290
你有你的法规  但我要救我的人
You may have your laws, but I'll have my man.

231
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,540
你认为一个强奸犯不该受到惩罚吗
You don't believe a rapist deserves to be punished?

232
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,550
应该
I do.

233
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,940
但我不接受没有证据的指控
But I don't accept that's what he is, not without proof.

234
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,300
我不认识这个女人
I don't know this woman,

235
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,540
我也没有听过她的控词
And I haven't heard her accusations.

236
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,930
我听过  她说的是事实
I have. She speaks the truth.

237
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,280
那只是她的一面之词
Well, that's an opinion,

238
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,150
对我而言  一切都是塞拉特编造的谎言
and for all I know, this is all a concoction of Serrat's.

239
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,130
我们的人不能还没有经过法定审判
We do not subject our people to summary judgment

240
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,850
就被当场判罪并处以极刑
and punishment without due process.

241
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,710
我们的法规已经存在几百年了
Our system has worked for hundreds of years.

242
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,280
在我这儿是行不通的
It doesn't work for me.

243
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:36,240
哈尔・安德斯隶属于美国海军
Hal Anders is a member of the United States Navy.

244
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,300
他必须依照我们的法律接受审判
He'll have a trial under my rules.

245
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,140
如果按照你们的法律审他
You try that man under your rules,

246
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,430
岛上没有人会相信审判结果
no one on the island will believe the verdict

247
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,290
而且他们会认为你是个暴君
or believe you to be less than a tyrant.

248
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,400
那我也只能忍受这份失望了
That's a disappointment I'll have to live with.

249
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,370
对方同意按军方的规矩进行审讯
We agreed on a military-style trial.

250
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,360
陪审团有7个人  3名我们的人
Seven member jury, three from the "Colorado,"

251
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,260
3名岛民  1名中立者
three from the island, one neutral.

252
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,150
超过5票即为有罪
It'll take five votes to convict.

253
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,820
我不知道  长官
I don't know, sir.

254
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,300
难道不该让他在"科罗拉多号"上
I think he should be tried on the "Colorado"

255
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,980
接受自己人的审讯吗
by his own people, no?

256
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,330
他只要出了艘潜艇
Once he stepped foot off this boat,

257
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,500
事情就没那么简单了
it got complicated.

258
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,500
这点你清楚  他也清楚
You know that. He knew that.

259
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,930
应该让岛民知道我们并不畏惧真相
This island needs to know that we're not afraid of the truth.

260
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,720
如果安德斯有罪
And if Anders is found guilty,

261
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,180
我们会对他实施惩罚
we'll do the punishing.

262
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,060
第7个陪审员是谁
So who's the seventh juror?

263
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,660
我已经跟索菲谈过了
I already spoke to Sophie.

264
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,590
长官  你知道安德斯是艇上唯一一个
Sir, you know Anders is the only one left

265
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,320
有资格掌管核反应堆的士兵吧
who's rated to work the reactor, right?

266
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,620
我很清楚他的宝贵价值
I'm aware of how valuable he is.

267
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,850
我在核潜艇上执行过两次任务
I did two tours in the nukes.

268
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:22,960
我可以暂时代替他
I can hold it down for a while.

269
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,070
之后呢
And after that?

270
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,330
如果出了什么岔子你愿意被困在里面吗
You really want to be stuck down there if something goes wrong?

271
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,930
我只希望安德斯没有强奸那个女人
I want Anders not to have done what the woman says he did.

272
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,070
如果真是他呢
What if he did?

273
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,960
我们先姑且认为他是无辜的吧
Let's give him the benefit of the doubt.

274
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,180
克里斯蒂还能怎么样  很生气呗
How do you think Christine was? She was pissed.

275
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,900
很好  她对我们越愤怒
Good. The angrier she is at us,

276
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,880
就越会感激你对她的关怀
the more grateful she'll be when you come through for her.

277
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,510
告诉她你动用了私人关系
Tell her you pulled some strings.

278
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:45,870
为她争取到了登船的资格
You're getting her on that boat.

279
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,060
跟她说她就要见到自己的丈夫了
Tell her she's getting to see her husband.

280
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,850
她一定会对你知无不言的
She'll trust you with anything after that.

281
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,660
老天  竟然设计让他成为你的白马王子
God. They're setting him up to be your white knight.

282
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,220
他们真的觉得这年头还有女人会上当吗
Do they really think women still fall for that?

283
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,280
-抱歉  -什么
- Sorry.  -What?

284
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,270
山姆  海军大英雄让你的生活不再单调
Sam. Big navy hero sweeps you away from your drab little life.

285
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,270
你有时真像个狂妄的贱人
You could be a real stuck-up bitch at times, can't you?

286
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,170
我知道  娘胎里带的  我正改呢
I know. Genetics. I'm working on it.

287
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,880
科利部长  她上船以后
Secretary Curry, when she's on that ship,

288
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,350
我希望你能保证她的安全
I need you to promise me she'll be safe.

289
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,720
不好意思保罗  我不能保证你任何事
Excuse me, Paul, but I'm not gonna promise you anything.

290
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,030
这可不仅仅是一个女人的问题
This isn't about just one woman.

291
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,640
更重要的是我们国家的未来
It's about the future of our country.

292
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,370
我相信在这点上你和我们是一致的
I thought you believed that as much as we do.

293
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,410
曾是的  我是说  现在也赞同
I did. I-I mean, I-I still do.

294
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:15,980
很好  现在听好了  有一个女人
Okay, now listen, there's a woman--

295
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,970
凯莉・辛克莱  有印象吗
Kylie Sinclair. Name ring a bell?

296
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,070
有  辛克莱武器财团继承人  怎么了
Yeah, daughter to the Sinclair weapons fortune. Why?

297
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,160
克里斯蒂提过她吗
Christine hasn't mentioned her?

298
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,480
没有  我得挂了
Not yet. Look, I gotta go.

299
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,640
我到了
I'm here.

300
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,100
他要进来了
And so he is.

301
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,470
等等  拿上这个
Wait, wait, wait. Take this. Take this.

302
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,640
拜托千万要是好消息
Please tell me it's good news.

303
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:44,290
我可以上那艘船吗
Were you able to get me on that boat?

304
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,950
我没能给你争取到机会
I couldn't get you cleared for the trip.

305
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:47,940
对不起
Sorry.

306
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,320
真的吗
Really?

307
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,630
我找了很多关系  可是他们不许
Went as far up the chain as I could, but they shot it down.

308
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,440
他们不想让你出现在那艘船上
They just don't want you on that ship.

309
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,050
真心希望能帮到你
I wish there was something I could do.

310
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,060
军士长
Chief.

311
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,580
艇长
Oh, captain.

312
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,210
准备出门
You going somewhere?

313
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,800
没有
Uh, no.

314
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,570
只是找些事做
It's, uh, just busy work.

315
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,100
尽量不去想...
Trying to keep my mind off of the...

316
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,120
我现在缺粮缺物资
I'm low on food and provisions.

317
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,380
尤其缺人手
I'm low on crew.

318
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,880
告诉我你没干那种事
Tell me you didn't do this.

319
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,350
告诉我那女人在撒谎
Tell me the woman's lying,

320
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,550
我会尽我所能保护你
and I will do whatever is necessary to protect you.

321
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,740
给我一本圣经  我可以发誓
You give me a bible, and I will swear on it.

322
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,180
我没有  长官
I did not do this, sir.

323
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,410
好的  军士长
Okay, chief.

324
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,710
明天同一时间
Same time tomorrow?

325
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,460
抱歉  上尉
Oh, sorry, lieutenant.

326
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,070
格蕾丝  请进
Come on in, Grace.

327
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,270
你听说过安德斯的事情了吧
You've heard about this, uh, situation with Anders?

328
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:46,880
是的  长官
Yes, sir.

329
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,660
好  我想你来替他辩护
Okay, I want you to handle his defense.

330
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,600
我不太确定自己是否合适
I'm just not sure I'm the right person for the job.

331
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,600
你在军校里曾是荣誉委员会成员
You've put in time on the honor committee at the academy,

332
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,290
已经比我们所有人都出色了
which is... more than the rest of us.

333
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,630
明白  长官
Understood, sir.

334
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,700
你只管尽力为他辩护
You just give him the best defense you can.

335
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:19,200
惊喜哦
Surprise.

336
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,120
不许动
Don't move!

337
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,570
塑料勺做撞匙很管用
M.R.E. Spoon makes a pretty good bump key.

338
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,470
要是我乐意
I could've been sipping tequila

339
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,120
三天前就在某处海滩上喝龙舌兰了
on a beach in antigua three days ago if that's what I'd wanted,

340
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,540
可我不想那样
but it's not what I want.

341
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,200
现在信我了吗
Trust me now?

342
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:37,110
我知道通讯点在哪  可以带你去
I know where the site is. I can take you there.

343
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,360
你知道通讯点在哪
You know where the site is?

344
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,360
我可以让你
I can put you on the horn with people

345
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,270
跟上层大人物直接通话
a lot more important than the two of us.

346
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,800
我有话要问他们  布斯
I'm gonna ask them what I need to, booth.

347
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,360
跟他们合作  山姆
You work with 'em, Sam,

348
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,210
他们会给你任何你想要的东西
they'll give you whatever you want.

349
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,650
不耍花招
No more tricks.

350
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,470
他来做什么
What's he doing here?

351
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,160
艇长
Captain.

352
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,560
我想这事肯定与你脱不了干系
I imagined your fingerprints would be all over this.

353
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,570
只是没想到你会主动跳出来
Just never thought they'd be so visible.

354
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,470
你们的争执先放在一边
Whatever your quarrel,

355
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,660
艾瑞塔请塞拉特先生代表原告发言
Erita has asked that Mr. Serrat speak for the prosecution.

356
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,690
朱利安一直对我很好
Julian has always been good to me.

357
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,140
而且他不怕你
And he's not afraid of you.

358
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,480
你确定吗
Are you quite sure of that?

359
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,620
我只想看正义得到伸张
I wish only to see justice served.

360
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:21,910
我们进去说
Let's go inside.

361
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,140
我发现人在青天白日之下更诚实
I've found that the open air is quite conducive to honesty.

362
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,350
你不同意吗  艇长
Do you not agree, captain?

363
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,290
你明白我们谈话的目的吧
Do you understand why we're all here?

364
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,380
我请他一起走走
I asked him to go for a walk.

365
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,340
我只想说说话
I just wanted to talk, you know?

366
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,680
的确  我们后来开始接吻
It's true, we started kissing.

367
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,060
他开始变得怪怪的
But he started acting strange,

368
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,130
说我应该把头发剪短
Telling me I should cut my hair,

369
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,410
他喜欢头发短一些的女人
that he liked women with shorter hair,

370
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,390
真是奇怪  就好像他自认是我男友
which was weird. Like he thought he was my boyfriend.

371
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,110
你也见过她
I-I mean, you've seen her.

372
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:08,040
她可以和任何她想要的人搞在一起
She could've gone off with anyone she wanted to.

373
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,040
是她选了我
She chose me.

374
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,530
然后我们开始接吻
Then we started kissing.

375
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:15,610
他抓住我
He grabbed me,

376
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,450
狠狠吻我
kissed me hard.

377
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,640
我说"不"
I told him "No."

378
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,410
我想逃  可他追过来
I tried to run, but he chased me.

379
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,840
然后他抓住我
After he caught me...

380
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,100
把我压倒
he held me down,

381
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,850
开始撕我的衣服
started tearing at my clothes.

382
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,180
我不否认和她发生过性关系
I'm not denying that we had sex.

383
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,870
我们做了  而且很愉快
We did, and it was nice.

384
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,430
我动弹不得
I couldn't move.

385
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:42,200
我只能躺在那儿  等待他发泄完
I just laid there waiting for it to be over.

386
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,320
我穿衣服的时候
When I started putting my clothes back on,

387
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,480
她说我欠她一百美元
she said that I owed her 100 bucks.

388
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,020
她可没提这一点
She didn't say anything about that.

389
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:49,670
她为什么要提
Why would she?

390
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:54,200
她只要说声"强奸"  我就成了禽兽
All she has to do is say the word "rape," and I become a monster.

391
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,700
这有何公正可言
Now where's the justice in that?

392
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,240
我不是自愿的
I didn't ask for this.

393
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,100
利比亚才是人间地狱
Now Libya-- that was hell.

394
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:09,490
持续了12天的狂乱
12 days of soul-searching madness.

395
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,460
听说把卡扎菲推上宝座花了不少功夫
I heard it was hard getting Gaddafi on the throne,

396
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,920
可你该看看把他拉下来又费了多大力
but you shoulda seen us trying to get him off.

397
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,130
你呢  有可见的伤疤吗
How about you? Any visible scars?

398
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,900
没有  北朝鲜人不喜欢留下记号
No, North Koreans don't like to leave marks.

399
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,950
对  至少不留在表面
Yeah, at least not on the outside.

400
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,430
我在16个国家被囚禁过
I've been thrown in the hole in 16 different countries.

401
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:26,090
如果这地方算国家  就是17个
Well, I guess 17 depending what you call this place.

402
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,530
你总被擒获
You get caught a lot.

403
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,530
没想过改行吗
You ever think about a different line of work?

404
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,650
干事业是有代价的
Ah, the price of doing business.

405
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,840
拷打我能承受  身体会恢复
Beatings I can take. The body bounces back.

406
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,130
可是感官剥夺...  眼睛蒙死
But sensory dep--blindfold,

407
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,050
鼻子堵住  耳朵塞上
nose closed, ears plugged--

408
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,310
好了  你说的很明白了
Okay, okay, you made your point.

409
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,690
一条通路直达脑内
One-way ticket straight to the inside of your head.

410
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:44,580
经历过后回到妻子身边都难
Hard to go back to the wife after that.

411
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,470
你结婚了吗
What, you're married?

412
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,270
结了  维持了几年
Yeah, for a couple of years back when.

413
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,080
不可调和的分歧
Irreconcilable differences.

414
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,080
不是她的错
It wasn't her fault.

415
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,800
她当初并不知道要面对怎样的婚后生活
She didn't know what she signed up for.

416
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,400
懂我意思吗
Know what I mean?

417
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,430
你当然懂
Yeah. You sure as hell do.

418
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,480
主泵读数400度以上
The main pump is reading more than 400 degrees.

419
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,890
你正遭受攻击  需要所有动力
You're under attack and need full power.

420
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,250
接通辅助泵
Bring second pump online,

421
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,260
冷却  动力降到80%
flush for cold while reducing power 80%.

422
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,870
-艇长需要动力全开  -不行
- Your captain needs full power. - He can't have it.

423
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:07,760
热得化了可哪里都去不了
We melt down, we're going nowhere.

424
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,870
辅助泵读数500度以上
The auxiliary pump is reading 500-plus degrees.

425
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,380
-关闭辅助泵  全停  -你正遭遇攻击
- Shut it down. Full stop. - You're under attack.

426
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:14,260
不关我事  超过红线40%  必须停
Not my problem. It's 40% over redline. Gotta stop.

427
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,840
您说我能在这样短的时间里掌握核潜艇吗
You think I can really get nuke rated this fast?

428
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,310
掌握潜艇  不能
Uh, nuke rated? No.

429
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,690
但是紧要关头坚持航行
But being able to keep us going when we have to?

430
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,430
才是现阶段的目标
That's the goal right now.

431
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,020
因为一旦我们失去安德斯
Because if we lose Anders,

432
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,160
艇上所有人的性命就掌握在你手里
every life in the sub is gonna be in your hands.

433
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,650
你可以相信我  长官
You can trust me, sir.

434
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,550
请进
Enter.

435
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,170
可以跟你谈谈吗
Can I talk to you, sir?

436
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,690
他对他们说谎
He's lying to them,

437
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,120
说我不想去
telling them that I don't want to go.

438
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,390
你想知道他为什么会这样吗
You ready for it all to start making sense?

439
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,150
保罗・威尔斯升平
The life and times of Paul Wells.

440
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,670
你的保罗从小孤独
So your Paul is one lonely guy.

441
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:52,760
郊区长大
Grew up in the suburbs.

442
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,300
安纳波利斯毕业之后进了乔治敦法学院
After Annapolis, went to Georgetown Law.

443
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,740
刚一工作就进了大公司

444
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,400
2007年接了一桩婚姻家庭法相关的案子
and then in 2007, gets a job practicing family law.

445
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,180
就在那时他遇到了她
That's when he met her.

446
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,590
她真漂亮
She's gorgeous.

447
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,430
她是他的委托人
She was his client.

448
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,030
为第二次离婚一案而找的他
Came to him for her second divorce,

449
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,520
他应该据此看清那女人  但他没有
which should've been a clue, but no.

450
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,740
他替她争下丰厚的和解金  作为结婚礼物
He got her a fat settlement as a wedding present.

451
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,730
一年后  她替他生下了丹尼尔
A year later, she gave him Daniel.

452
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:14,170
九个月后  她带走了丹尼尔
Nine months after that, she took Daniel away.

453
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:14,800
事先毫无说明
No warning.

454
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,620
直接带上那孩子  搭上了去巴西圣保罗的飞机
Just takes the kid, hops on a plane to Sao Paulo.

455
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:21,640
他已经两年没跟儿子见面或通电话
He hasn't seen or spoken to his son in two years.

456
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,820
那太不幸了
That's terrible.

457
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,720
那男人总会爱上自己拯救的女人
This is a man who falls for the women he saves.

458
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,200
现在那女人就是你
Right now that's you.

459
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,100
所以你们那晚的吻或许
So that kiss the other night probably lodged itself

460
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,670
直击他缺爱的小心脏中  爱意正在
right in the middle of his needy little heart,

461
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:32,420
萌芽
where it's growing--

462
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,430
不
No.

463
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,690
我不是说要让你和他上床
I'm not saying you have to sleep with him--

464
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,130
很好  因为我不会的
Good, because I'm not going to.

465
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:40,410
我是说  你正面临大好机会
I'm saying, you have an opportunity.

466
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:44,170
利用一个心碎父亲的寂寞吗
To exploit a heartbroken father's loneliness?

467
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,160
他每天过来  都在做一个选择
Every day this guy comes here and makes a choice.

468
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,390
但他每天都选择欺骗你
Every day he chooses to lie to you,

469
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,500
摆布你
to manipulate you,

470
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,850
试图毁掉你和你的婚姻
to try and destroy you and your marriage.

471
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:54,940
那就是他的真面目  再无其他
That's what this guy is. Nothing more.

472
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,900
现在我们知道他想要什么
Now we know what he wants.

473
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,270
就是你
You.

474
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:02,070
所以你想要如何去应对
So what are you willing to do about it?

475
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,190
还得上多高
How far up is it?

476
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,690
再爬6公里
Another six klicks.

477
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,450
但上面是笔直的  吉普车到这儿就没用了
But it's straight up. The jeep's useless from here.

478
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,470
好吧  我们就在这儿扎营  明天早点开始
Okay. Let's camp here. Get an early start.

479
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:32,140
给  你今天的鹅肝口粮
Your, uh, your foie gras rations for the day.

480
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,140
话说...
So, um...

481
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,650
你结婚多久了  肯德尔
how long you been married, Kendal?

482
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,210
你读过我的联合特种作战司令部档案
You read my J.S.O.C. File.

483
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,940
我只是想跟你谈心而已
Just making polite conversation.

484
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:46,860
好吧
Okay.

485
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,040
我已经结婚两年了
I've been married two years.

486
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,260
你一直在海上  所以加起来也就在一起6周吗
You been at sea, what, all but six weeks?

487
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:51,850
是的
That's right.

488
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,750
眼下你恐怕得过很久才能回去了吧
Gonna be a while before you get back now, huh?

489
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,350
我一定会回去的
I'll get back.

490
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,060
我一直都喜欢火
Always loved fire.

491
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,550
火焰中是纯净的世界  美丽和死亡
That's purity right there. Beauty and death.

492
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:09,110
他们把我的手绑在身后
They tied my hands behind my back.

493
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,580
他把我按在一块木板上
He sat me down on a plank.

494
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,300
木板下面堆着砖头
Couple of bricks underneath.

495
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:16,460
谁知道当一名海军要受那样的罪
Who ever knew sitting on a board could hurt so bad?

496
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,850
过了...
After...

497
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,260
过了不知道多久
I don't know how long it was...

498
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,280
他们走了进来  拿走了木板
They came in, they took the plank away

499
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,210
然后让我跪在砖头上
and made me kneel on the bricks.

500
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:31,180
然后把枪抵在你的脑袋上吗
That when they put the gun to your head?

501
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:40,720
我想着我的妻子  支撑我挺过去
I'd get through it thinking about my wife.

502
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,470
她在玩填字游戏时
The way her hair hung down over her face

503
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,480
秀发披在前面的样子
when she was doing the crossword.

504
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,110
那现在是什么支撑着你
What gets you through now, then?

505
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,090
同样的事
Same thing.

506
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,560
我妻子  她
My wife, she, uh...

507
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:02,400
她有一种习惯  她每次
She has this... She answers "Yes"

508
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,900
在我话没问完的时候  就说"好的"
before I finish asking her for something.

509
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,880
那让她显得过于顺从  但其实不是的  她
It makes her sound like a bit of a pushover, but she's not. It's...

510
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,630
那是种信任
It's trust.

511
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,960
是信赖
It's belief.

512
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,240
我也说不清
I don't know.

513
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,970
那样的女人  老兄
These women, man...

514
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,970
会让我们怀疑已知的一切
make us doubt everything we know.

515
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,660
然后在你根本都毫无预料的时候
And then when you least expect it...

516
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,220
帮助你撑过最艰难的时期
They get you through hell.

517
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,750
是的  没错
Yes, they do.

518
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,590
明天你就离你的目标更近一步
And tomorrow you get a step closer to yours.

519
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,370
作为一个英雄光荣返乡
You'll go home a hero.

520
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,740
他们或许会为你办个阅兵式
Probably throw you a damn parade.

521
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,380
我以为你们这样的不会推举英雄
Thought you guys didn't have heroes.

522
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,670
我们是没有
We don't.

523
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,730
但我们深知如何让别人成为英雄
But we sure as hell know how to make 'em.

524
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,520
每个政变都需要一个完美的故事
Every coup d'etat needs a story.

525
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,320
每个故事都需要主人公
Every story needs a face.

526
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,990
马库斯・查普林显然不是那个大英雄
Marcus Chaplin wasn't gonna be that mug.

527
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,850
相信我  马库斯不需要一场阅兵式
Believe me, Marcus doesn't need a parade 

528
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,590
来证明他的身份
to tell him who he is.

529
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,100
那基本不可能
Not by a long shot.

530
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,410
你仍然未下定决心  是吗
You still haven't made up your mind, have you?

531
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,210
如果我告诉你  你那样会救他的命呢
What if I told you, you're saving his life?

532
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,440
布斯
Booth...

533
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,460
如果你想让他死
If you wanted him dead,

534
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,590
他早已经死了
he'd be dead already.

535
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,990
组织向来都不喜欢殉道者
The agency has a bad history with martyrs.

536
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,550
我们十分恐惧他们
We're downright terrified of 'em.

537
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,420
但万不得已  我们只能做殉道者
But we'll make 'em if we have to.

538
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,370
他从没对你动手动脚吗
He never tried anything?

539
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,200
安德斯吗  当然没有
Anders? Hell, no.

540
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,570
他是个正直的好人
He was one of the good guys.

541
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:32,650
跟艇上的其他男兵形成鲜明对比
As opposed to the rest of the frat boys on this boat.

542
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:36,100
每次在通道相遇都想揩油  让人避之不及
Somehow there's just never enough space to get by them in a corridor.

543
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,090
咸猪手乱摸...
And the hands...

544
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,740
你为什么不举报
Why don't you report it?

545
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,940
不行  一旦举报  你自己就成了麻烦
Nah. You report it, you become a problem.

546
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,290
幸运的话  你会被调离
Best case, you get transferred.

547
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,290
不幸的话  你会被调到更差劲的地方
Worst case, you get transferred someplace worse.

548
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:46,450
但安德斯  他一直很规矩对吗
But Anders--he kept his hands to himself?

549
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,970
他是我在核反应堆控制部的军士长
He's my department chief at the reactor.

550
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,080
他从未有过不轨行为
He never tried a thing,

551
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,380
但他最近有些异样
but he's been different lately.

552
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,600
沉默  可能是因为他妻子的事
Quiet. Probably 'cause of his wife.

553
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,300
他妻子怎么了
What happened with his wife?

554
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,600
下海10天后  收到妻子要求断绝关系的家信
Got the "Dear John" family-gram ten days into the tour.

555
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:01,730
-她提出了离婚申请  -她还怀孕了
- She filed for divorce. - She's pregnant, too.

556
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,700
-天啊  -是啊  真无情
- God. - Yeah, stone cold.

557
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,690
那事发生的几天后
Couple days after it happened,

558
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:06,850
我发现他盯着我看
I caught him looking at me.

559
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,380
不是色咪咪那种  更像是...
Not really sexual. It was more...

560
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,280
什么
What?

561
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,830
我说不清  伤心
I don't know. Sad.

562
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:13,730
似乎现在任何一个女人
Like every woman from now on

563
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:15,680
都只会让他想起她
is only gonna make him think of her.

564
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,790
你认为他强奸了那个女孩吗
Do you think that he raped that girl?

565
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,110
我不知道
I don't know.

566
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,940
她混迹在酒吧
She hangs around the bar,

567
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:22,990
跟男人们搭讪
chatting up the guys.

568
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:25,210
她在"鹰巢"酒吧工作
She works at the Buzzard's Nest.

569
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,150
那只是表面上的"工作"罢了
Well, that's one way to put it.

570
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,110
哈尔不是唯一跟她上过的男人
Hal's not the only one she's been with.

571
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,740
我也跟她上过
She was with me, too.

572
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,220
而且不是免费的
And it wasn't for free.

573
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,930
你花钱跟她上床吗
You gave her money for sex?

574
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:36,080
不  不是钱
No, not money.

575
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,820
而是食物  杂志
Food, magazines, you know...

576
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,520
手边随便什么东西
whatever's lying around.

577
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,810
她可是很乐意接受呢
She was more than happy to take it.

578
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:44,940
当他向我报告这一信息的时候
When he came to me with this information,

579
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,280
我觉得有必要让双方都知道
I thought it was important to share with both parties.

580
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,560
长官  里士满和安德斯是好朋友
Sir, Richmond and Anders are friends.

581
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,550
他们一起经历...
They came up through the--

582
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,230
我以为你是想找出真相
I thought you wanted to get to the truth.

583
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:01,980
你的任务是为一位美国军人提供有力的辩护
Your job is to provide an American serviceman with a vigorous defense.

584
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,520
就因为她也和里士满上床了
Just because she may have slept with Richmond,

585
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,330
就因为她事后收受了礼物
just because she may have accepted gifts afterwards,

586
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:06,900
并不意味着她就不是被强奸的
doesn't mean she wasn't raped.

587
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,890
如果事件有相关性  就好好利用
If it's relevant, use it.

588
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,300
长官  我知道安德斯是你的得力干将
Sir, I know that Anders is your bull nuke.

589
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,810
所以当需要将核反应堆联机时
So when it comes to keeping the reactor online,

590
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:16,240
他是你的第一选择  也是唯一选择
he's your number one, he's your only one.

591
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,470
所以我能理解你的愿望
So I can understand your desire.

592
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:21,270
我不喜欢你话里有话  上尉
I do not like the implication, lieutenant.

593
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,710
抱歉  长官
Sorry, sir.

594
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,680
告诉我不会像往常一样内部处理
Just tell me this isn't gonna be navy justice as usual.

595
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,830
告诉我能以更好的方式解决
Tell me we can do better.

596
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,340
干好你的本职工作  上尉
Be the best at your job, lieutenant,

597
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,760
其它事情都会自行解决
and the rest will sort itself out.

598
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,320
是  长官
Yes, sir.

599
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,280
这些是礼物
They were gifts.

600
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,740
我没有要求过这些
I didn't ask for any of it.

601
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,320
他说这些作为嫖资
Well, he said they were payment for sex.

602
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,970
这算什么  你们来质问我吗
What is this? I'm the one you're asking questions about?

603
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:43,840
为什么不问哈尔・安德斯
What about Hal Anders?

604
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,400
我也在质问他
I'm asking about him, too.

605
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,930
是吗  问问他有没有撞倒过其他姑娘
Are you? Ask him if he ran down any other girls.

606
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,570
有没有把别人推倒在地上
If he pushed anyone else to the ground,

607
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:53,370
扒光她的衣服  压在她身上
tore off her clothes, and held her down?

608
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:58,710
你能问问他曾经有没有干过这些吗
Will you ask him if he'd ever done any of that?

609
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:02,400
因为那就是他
Because that's what he did

610
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,880
对我的暴行
to me.

611
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,140
克里斯蒂
Christine?

612
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,610
别管那些
Leave them off.

613
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,610
电话中你听起来很奇怪
You sounded strange on the phone.

614
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,340
你是不是
Are you, uh...

615
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,960
我得去见我的丈夫
I have to see my husband.

616
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,040
我说过  能做的我都做了
I told you, I've done everything I can.

617
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:22,330
我知道你思念他  但你
I know you miss him, but you--

618
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,960
不是这样
That's not it.

619
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,080
我得见到山姆
I need to see Sam

620
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,270
这样我才能告诉他我要离开他
so I can tell him that I'm leaving him.

621
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,220
但我得当面告诉他
But I have to tell him in person,

622
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,420
不然他不会相信的
otherwise he'll never believe it.

623
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,020
他只会
He'll just...

624
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,660
他只会认为那是政府的又一个诡计
He'll just think that it's another government trick.

625
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,510
我以为你深爱他
I thought you loved him.

626
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,160
我吻了你
I kissed you.

627
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,260
那个吻
That was, uh--

628
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:43,450
我知道那意味着什么  你也是
I know what it was, and so do you.

629
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:46,850
我不喜欢  也感到羞耻  但
And I don't like it and I am not proud of it, but...

630
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,560
但这感觉是真的
but it was real.

631
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,490
所以我得见到我的丈夫
So I need to see my husband.

632
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:59,040
这样我才能告诉他一切都结束了
So I can tell him that it's over.

633
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,840
世界之巅啊
Top of the world.

634
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,700
你知道发送或接收的信息都会被加密吧
You realize anything in or out will be encrypted?

635
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,820
看来我只能信你一次了
Guess I'm just gonna have to trust you then.

636
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,480
好吧
Okay.

637
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,580
先把话说明白
Just so we're clear,

638
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,960
你提出问题  你为他们工作
you ask the question, you're working for them.

639
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,520
休眠者是谁
Who's the sleeper agent?

640
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,450
你会让查普林知道吗
Intel just for you or Chaplin?

641
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,610
看来我也只能相信你了
Guess I'll just have to trust you.

642
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,170
的确如此
I guess so.

643
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,890
好的
All right.

644
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:49,990
要等一会  他们要先解码
It'll take a minute for the backup singers to transpose the lyric.

645
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,350
知道吗  我碰到了加扎菲
You know, I met Gadhafi.

646
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,660
他最后成了个疯子
He was one crazy mother in the end.

647
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,890
但之前  你不会想到
But before-- you'd never think it now--

648
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:04,340
他很谦逊
but he was humble.

649
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,540
抱歉  你刚说他很谦逊吗
I'm sorry. Did you say he was humble?

650
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,360
是啊  他是这样
Yeah, he was,

651
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,000
就像他接到了一个神圣的电话
like he'd been given a sacred calling,

652
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
接着就成了他一生的负担
and it was his burden in life to answer.

653
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,580
不  这是妄想而非谦逊
No, that's more delusional than humble.

654
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,910
不  起初不是那样
Nah, wasn't like that at first.

655
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:17,220
他的确认为他能改变世界
He really thought he could change the world.

656
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,610
最后却是世界改变了他
Then the world changed him.

657
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:19,820
是世界改变了他吗
The world changed him, huh?

658
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,420
我不知道  布斯
I don't know, Booth.

659
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,330
听起来他一开始就像是个疯子
Sounds like he was a nut job right from the start.

660
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:23,350
想法不错
Nice to believe that.

661
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:26,500
天下所有的坏人都和其他人相异
All the bad people in the world are nothing like the rest of us.

662
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,980
他们天生就有缺陷  没得到足够的父爱
They got a defective gene. Daddy didn't love 'em enough.

663
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,970
但事实并非这样
But that ain't the case.

664
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,760
坏人只是那些初尝权利
Bad people are just decent folks

665
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,410
却一发不可收拾的好人
who've had a taste of power and wanted more.

666
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,860
就好比你的长官
Take your captain, for example.

667
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,220
我知道你不想听这些  山姆
I know you don't want to hear it, Sam,

668
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:41,360
但马库斯・查普林距离
but Marcus Chaplin is one spoonful away

669
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,220
重蹈加扎菲的覆辙只有一步之遥了
from going the way of the Gadhafis of the world.

670
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,270
我知道你在干什么  你可以闭嘴了
I know what you're doing and you can cut the crap, okay?

671
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,750
你不了解他  一点也不
You don't know the man. Not even close.

672
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,190
开玩笑吗  这就是我们干的事  山姆
Are you kidding? It's what we do, Sam.

673
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:51,490
我们进入其他国家  挑起事端
We go into countries, we stir things up,

674
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:52,690
然后我们带走某人
then we pick someone.

675
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:55,440
某些军方人士  某些具有领导能力
Someone from the military, someone with leadership skills,

676
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,540
和正义感的人
and the righteousness

677
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:00,320
他们相信自己能统领所有人
to think they make up the rules for everyone.

678
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,070
听起来耳熟吗
Sound like anyone you know?

679
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,090
棒球
Baseball.

680
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:09,760
4  6
Four. Six.

681
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,500
2  1
Two. One.

682
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:12,780
飞机场
Airport.

683
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:16,370
6  5  3  6
Six. Five. Three. Six.

684
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,970
帮我个忙
Do me a-a favor.

685
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,400
叫我的名字
Say my name.

686
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,680
搞什么  布斯
Come on, Booth. 

687
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,910
不  我的真名  约翰・斯托瑟
No. My real name. John Stosur.

688
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:28,310
-为什么  -拜托了  山姆
- Why? - Please, Sam.

689
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:30,590
约翰・斯托瑟
John Stosur.

690
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,240
我已经20年没听到别人这么叫我了
I haven't heard it out loud in 20 years.

691
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,950
我错了
I was wrong.

692
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,570
他们不愿说出休眠者是谁
They won't give up the sleeper.

693
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,260
政府资产比你对他们更重要
Asset's more important to them than you.

694
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:08,690
美国人认为这是我们在这座岛上
The americans believe that this is the first trial

695
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:10,170
实行的第一次审判
we've ever had on this island.

696
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,220
不
No!

697
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,510
但我们已经审判过许多次了
But we've had many trials.

698
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,410
对
Yes!

699
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:17,160
我们刚来这里就有过审判
Trials that began when they first came here.

700
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,210
我们得容忍他们占领我们的街道
We've had to share our streets with them.

701
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:22,580
我们得看着我们的孩子们挨饿
We've had to watch our children starve

702
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,450
因为他们在船上不能挨饿
because they won't allow in boats.

703
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:25,790
是的
Yes.

704
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,490
他们不愿离开  所以我们会遭难
We've had to spill our blood because they won't leave.

705
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:31,630
我们得因为他们引起的战争而失去和平
We've had to give up our peaceful lives for their war.

706
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,400
我们真的能在这找到正义吗
Can we really hope to find justice here?

707
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,450
不  我们真的能相信这个姑娘
No. Can we really believe that this girl--

708
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:39,850
我们的姐妹  女儿  我们的同胞
our sister, our daughter, our own.

709
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:41,090
我们能看到
Can expect to see the man

710
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:44,180
那个强奸她的男人受到制裁吗
responsible for her rape punished for his crime?

711
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,290
不
No.

712
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:48,600
我不相信这里有正义
I don't believe there is justice here,

713
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,930
但也许你能证明我是错的
but maybe you will prove me wrong.

714
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,060
我们不知道那晚发生了什么
We'll never know what happened that night.

715
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:06,650
我们不知道是因为没有任何证据
We'll never know because there is no evidence.

716
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:09,120
没有目击者
No witnesses.

717
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:10,430
没有物证
No physical proof.

718
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:13,710
没有伤痕来证明是否做过反抗
No cuts or bruises to indicate a struggle.

719
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,710
没有证据
And without evidence,

720
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:18,590
只有他俩各执一词
it's just her story against his.

721
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,600
我们不会剥夺自由
We do not take away freedom.

722
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:27,250
我们不会因为一个人的说词  
We do not injure, lash, brand a man

723
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,660
就伤害  鞭打和谴责另一个人
because of what one person says.

724
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:32,120
我们不会那样
We're better than that.

725
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,780
现在没有证据
There is no evidence.

726
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,600
只有一个女人的说词
Just a word a woman said.

727
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,920
个人说词不能证明一个人有罪
A word does not make a man guilty.

728
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:22,860
在学校发生过这种事
It happened at the academy.

729
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,580
我把一个渎职的候补军官带到了委员会
I had brought a cadet before the committee for misconduct.

730
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:29,250
那是他的一个朋友
It was one of his friends.

731
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:32,180
他想要复仇
He wanted revenge.

732
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:36,340
他如愿了
He got it.

733
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,720
格蕾丝  我很抱歉
Grace, I'm so sorry.

734
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,810
我向最高领导汇报了这件事
I reported it to the master chief.

735
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:44,970
他告诉我
And he told me that...

736
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,020
作为一个海军上将的女儿
as an admiral's daughter,

737
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:51,460
我应该想想外界的看法
I should think about how it would be perceived.

738
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:54,270
那会是我和他各执一词
That it would be my story against his,

739
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:57,540
如果我起诉  没人能取胜
and that no one could win if I brought charges.

740
00:32:57,690 --> 00:32:59,280
所以你就放弃了
So you dropped it?

741
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:03,570
我不得不每天都见到
I had to see the man who raped me...

742
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,430
那个强奸我的人
every day

743
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,130
一直到我毕业
until I graduated.

744
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,700
艾瑞塔肯定被奸污了
Erita was raped.

745
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:18,590
我和她交谈的时候
When I talked to her,

746
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:21,010
我能看出来她都经历了什么
I could see what she was going through.

747
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,800
并且她经历的正是
And that is something that...

748
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:27,440
我努力不再去想
I have tried to never think about again...

749
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:31,000
不再触碰的事
to never feel again.

750
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:37,230
但是我看出来了
But I recognized it.

751
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,820
我知道她被强奸了
I knew it.

752
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:06,530
发生什么事了
What happened?

753
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:09,930
出结果了
Verdict's in.

754
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,740
无罪
Not guilty.

755
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,860
蹲下
Get down!

756
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,830
快过来
Come on.

757
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,470
雷达站安全  但是有些船员被困在那
The E.W.S. is secure, but there's crew pinned down in the bivouac.

758
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:54,850
好的  通知他们
Okay, radio back.

759
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,430
不允许朝人群开火
I don't want any shots fired into that crowd.

760
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:57,580
明白
Got it.

761
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:58,800
艇长
Captain, uh,

762
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,920
我觉得应该告诉你陪审团的投票情况
I think you should know how the jury voted.

763
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,500
我和两名船员认为他有罪
Two of the crewmembers and myself thought he was guilty.

764
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:07,490
一名船员和所有的岛民都投了无罪
One of your crew and all the islanders voted not guilty.

765
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,520
我不知道为什么
I-I don't know why.

766
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:16,320
塞拉特操纵陪审团反对自己
Serrat rigged the jury against himself.

767
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,290
他一手策划这次骚乱
He wanted this to happen.

768
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:25,150
不用担心
Don't worry.

769
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,570
今晚没人能进来
No one's coming through those doors. Not tonight.

770
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:32,220
这其实应该是我最后一次出海
This was supposed to be my last tour.

771
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,900
我现在应该在家了
I should be home right now.

772
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,830
听说这次出海期间你老婆生了孩子
Hear you have a baby on the way.

773
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,630
不  她离开我了
No, she left me.

774
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:43,700
怀孕四个月时  她遇到了一个人
Four months pregnant, and she meets some other guy.

775
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:46,180
如果我能和她谈谈
If only I could've talked to her,

776
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,260
我可能能让她回心转意
I could have made her see things straight,

777
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,680
但他
But he...

778
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,440
算了  她已经离开我了
No, she's gone.

779
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:56,160
而且现在
And now, uh...

780
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:56,680
现在怎么了
Now what?

781
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,740
现在这样  这些人烧自己的街道
Now this. These people burning up their streets,

782
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,900
嚷着要我的命
screaming for my head.

783
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,170
你只不过想回家
You just wanted to go home.

784
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:03,930
那姑娘当着众人面对我示好
That girl coming on to me in front of everybody...

785
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:05,290
你就吻她因为你认为
And you kissed her because you thought

786
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,150
她想你那么做
that's what she wanted.

787
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,690
她的确是那样
She did want it.

788
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,090
那不是你的错
Well, it's not your fault--

789
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,630
我知道不是我的错
I know it's not my fault.

790
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,150
他不放我们回家
He won't let me go home.

791
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,300
他不会让我去见我妻子
He won't let me see my wife.

792
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,180
所以当艾瑞塔反抗时  已经太迟了是吗
And by the time Erita told you no, it was too late to stop.

793
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,520
我绝不会做那种事情  绝不会
I would never do something like that. Never.

794
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,190
但你做了
But you did.

795
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:26,200
她叫你停下
She told you to stop.

796
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,240
她是笑着说的
She said it with a smirk.

797
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:31,010
你强奸了她
You raped her.

798
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,140
这全是艇长的错
This is the captain's fault!

799
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,570
是他不让我们回家  好吗
He won't let any of us go home. Okay?

800
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:38,080
这是他的错  不是我的
This is his fault! Not mi--

801
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:56,540
科利部长  我终于说服她了
Secretary Curry, I finally got her to come around.

802
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,480
她说只有我陪着  她才会去
She said she'll only go if I go with her.

803
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,150
确保他在你身边
Making sure he stays close to you.

804
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,340
好的  听着保罗  我要你
Fine. Listen, Paul, I'm gonna need you

805
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,760
往深了挖一挖
to dig up a little something.

806
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,230
海豹陆战队员都会带着头盔摄像机
Navy SEALS, they wear helmet cams.

807
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:08,340
摄像机会记录在加密芯片上
The cams record onto encrypted chips.

808
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,890
克里斯蒂的新朋友凯莉・辛克莱
Christine's new friend Kylie Sinclair,

809
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:11,950
她有读取这些影响的技术权限
she has access to tech that can read them.

810
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:14,010
如果这个女人这么危险
Look, if this woman's so dangerous to you,

811
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:14,830
你为何不
why don't you just--

812
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:16,960
不经意地跟克里斯蒂提一下
Yeah, just mention it to Christine in passing.

813
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,930
我想看看她有什么反应
I want to know how she reacts.

814
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,740
你会联系山姆  告之我会去找他
So you'll reach Sam, tell him I'm coming?

815
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:32,050
是的  但是你要小心
Yes. Just be careful.

816
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,410
你也是
You, too.

817
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:47,680
我不怎么交女性朋友
I don't usually make female friends.

818
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,200
老实说  我一直把其他女人当竞争对手
Honestly, I tend to think of other women as the competition.

819
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:54,100
我意思是  击败她们
You know, to be crushed.

820
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:57,770
我就说说而已
I'm just saying.

821
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:00,300
别那么不好意思
Don't strain a muscle.

822
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,500
我也喜欢你
I like you, too.

823
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:04,910
谢谢你
Thank you.

824
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,190
这些旧木板都发霉了
These old boards are pretty moldy.

825
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,500
你应该把整个地板都换了
You should probably replace the whole floor.

826
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,730
只要一两天时间
Just take me a day or two.

827
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:35,850
你不必停业太久
You wouldn't have to shut down for long.

828
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,360
常在河边走
You can't keep one foot in the water

829
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:43,080
哪能不湿鞋
and one on the shore.

830
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,370
你说什么
What?

831
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,160
谢谢你
Thank you.

832
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:54,150
谢我什么
For what?

833
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:56,720
就是  谢谢你
Just... thank you.

834
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,570
我再去那些木板来  好吗
Just need to get some more lumber. All right?

835
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:13,930
好的
Okay.

836
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,630
终于有机会能回艇上了
There's a window to get to the sub.

837
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,770
抓紧时间  快走
Let's not let it close. Let's go!

838
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:43,410
-长官  -身为"科罗拉多号"艇长
- Sir? - As captain of the "Colorado,"

839
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:45,100
基于你的不道德的行为
it's my obligation to issue a discharge

840
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,790
我有责任将你解职
based upon immoral conduct.

841
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:48,590
二级军士长哈罗德・安德斯
Senior Chief Petty Officer Harold Anders,

842
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,110
你被解除所有职务
You're hereby relieved of duty

843
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,910
并需要监禁
and ordered to be taken into custody.

844
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,450
你在说什么  他们认为我是清白的
What the hell are you talking about? They found me innocent.

845
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:54,780
不  虽然他们认为你无罪
No, they found you not guilty.

846
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,540
但我们都知道你不是清白的
We both know you're not innocent.

847
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,390
你在潜艇里可以受到保护
You will be afforded my protection on the submarine,

848
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:00,950
但不再作为船员或者访客
but it won't be as a crewmember or as a guest.

849
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:03,010
你会被铐在禁闭室
It'll be in handcuffs and confined to solitary

850
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:05,560
直到你安全移交美国有关部门
till you can safely be handed over to American authority.

851
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,020
你这道貌岸然的杂种
You sanctimonious son of a bitch.

852
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,400
我决不允许一个强奸犯
I won't have an admitted rapist

853
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,570
在我的船上走动并和我的船员混在一起
walk free on my boat and mingle with my crew.

854
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,010
你们不能把我铐起来
You're not putting me in cuffs.

855
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:14,250
你想在我船上待着就得这样
That's the only way you're stepping foot on my boat.

856
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,480
救援船一天后就到了
Relief boat gets here in a day.

857
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:23,740
你认为我撑不了一天
You think I can't survive until then?

858
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,530
我才不会去想你活下来几率多大
Hey, I won't calculate those odds.

859
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:27,260
但是  在这岛上  你被判无罪
But it's true, on this island, you're an acquitted man.

860
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:29,310
你做任何决定是你的自由
You're free to make your own choices.

861
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:30,950
你就让他这么对我
You're just gonna let him do this?

862
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:34,280
如果我是你  我认为还是被铐着的好
If it were up to me, it'd be a lot worse than handcuffs.

863
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,300
见你的鬼去吧  长官
I'll see you in hell, sir.

864
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:42,390
上车
In the jeep.

865
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,530
我们走
Let's go.

866
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


867
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
