1
00:00:06,069 --> 00:00:08,029
"伊波拉浩劫" 前情提要
Previously on The Hot Zone...

2
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:10,698
我们正在处理的事情可能比以往遇到的任何情况都要糟糕
What we're dealing with could be worse than anything we've ever seen.

3
00:00:10,698 --> 00:00:12,075
我们这儿有一整支团队
We do have a team here.

4
00:00:12,075 --> 00:00:12,825
我的团队
My team.

5
00:00:12,825 --> 00:00:15,328
我的意思是 我刚刚亲自甄选出最好的队员
I mean, I just finished handpicking the best crew to go in

6
00:00:15,328 --> 00:00:17,205
我还没向他们作情况简报
and I haven't even briefed them yet.

7
00:00:17,205 --> 00:00:22,710
伊波拉-扎伊尔毒株被定义为四级生化危害病原体的原因是
The reason Ebola Zaire is classified as a BL4 agent is there's no vaccine.

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:23,753
没有疫苗 无法治愈
No treatment.

9
00:00:23,753 --> 00:00:26,798
我们面对的敌人有能力摧毁一座城市
We are facing an enemy that can devastate a city.

10
00:00:26,798 --> 00:00:30,969
而你们就是矗立在这个敌人和门外平民之间的一道屏障
And you're what's standing between it and the civilians outside those doors.

11
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:32,971
南希根本就不应该让卡特加入进来
Nancy should never have brought Carter in.

12
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:34,973
如果你让我代替南希来负责
If you put me in charge instead of Nancy...

13
00:00:34,973 --> 00:00:36,182
别误会我 杰瑞
Don't get me wrong, Jerry.

14
00:00:36,182 --> 00:00:38,184
南希是这儿最优秀的人之一
Nancy's one of the best we've ever had come through here.

15
00:00:38,184 --> 00:00:40,478
但她这次做错了决定
But she hitched herself to the wrong horse on this one.

16
00:00:40,478 --> 00:00:42,939
我跟你说过 我有多么不希望你进去
I told you how much I didn't want you going in there.

17
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:45,233
我了解那些病原体 杰瑞
I know these pathogens, Jerry!

18
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:47,151
也许比任何人都了解
Probably more than anybody else.

19
00:00:47,151 --> 00:00:50,238
我接受了那么多年的培训就是为了这一天
This is the day I've been trained for!

20
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:52,198
我才是那个可以牺牲的
I'm the one who's expendable.

21
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:53,575
我跟杰瑞一起去
I'm going in with Jerry.

22
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:55,285
里面有事情等着做 无关个人
Job's got to get done. It's not personal.

23
00:00:55,285 --> 00:00:56,786
去他妈的无关个人
Oh, like hell it isn't.

24
00:00:56,786 --> 00:00:58,288
总得有人去抓那个怪物
Somebody's going to get the monster.

25
00:00:58,496 --> 00:01:02,417
如果感觉心跳开始加速就开始呼吸
If you find your heart start to race, just breathe it through.

26
00:01:03,459 --> 00:01:05,670
卡特 开灯 嘿 没关系
Carter light. It's okay, it's okay.

27
00:01:06,838 --> 00:01:07,755
重新找一个
Find a new one.

28
00:01:07,755 --> 00:01:09,882
我们得从所有工人以及
We need to draw blood from all the workers

29
00:01:09,882 --> 00:01:12,719
他们身体接触过的所有人身上抽血 马上
and whoever they were in physical contact with now.

30
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:14,887
我可以今晚检测他们
I can have them tested tonight.

31
00:01:14,887 --> 00:01:18,725
我可以派人守住大楼入口 确保没人能进去
I can station someone outside the building, but we need to be careful.

32
00:01:18,725 --> 00:01:20,101
媒体到处在打听
The press sniffing around,

33
00:01:20,101 --> 00:01:21,936
他们会开始问问题
they're going to start asking questions.

34
00:01:22,395 --> 00:01:25,565
你们将要与一种病毒战斗
You're going into combat against a virus for whom

35
00:01:25,565 --> 00:01:28,276
幸存是最重要的
survival is all that matters.

36
00:01:28,443 --> 00:01:32,530
你们也要这样 我们就都能回家
You guys think the same way and we all come home.

37
00:02:07,106 --> 00:02:08,149
好的 都听好了
All right, listen up.

38
00:02:09,317 --> 00:02:11,986
这个地方已经废弃了34个小时
This location's been abandoned for 34 hours.

39
00:02:11,986 --> 00:02:14,030
那里的动物都饿得慌
Animals in there are hungry.

40
00:02:14,197 --> 00:02:16,366
预计会有激烈的反应
Expect a violent reaction.

41
00:02:16,908 --> 00:02:18,660
小动物们不喜欢穿制服的人
Little guys don't like the suits.

42
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,704
但请不要忘记 它们可不是可憎的敌人
And let's not forget, these are not hostile enemies.

43
00:02:21,704 --> 00:02:25,083
它们只是被动卷入了旋涡的灵长类动物
Just primates who got involved in something they did not ask for.

44
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,959
它们和我们的目标一样...
They have the same goal we do...

45
00:02:27,418 --> 00:02:28,503
生存
To survive.

46
00:02:28,503 --> 00:02:30,088
伊波拉病毒也是如此
Just like Ebola.

47
00:02:30,088 --> 00:02:33,174
只不过 它比我们更聪明 更擅长生存
Except it's smarter and better at it than we are.

48
00:02:33,341 --> 00:02:34,676
预计什么时候到
What's our ETA?

49
00:02:35,134 --> 00:02:36,928
-大概一个小时  -很好
-About an hour. -Good.

50
00:02:37,053 --> 00:02:39,847
我们要在没人注意到我们之前完成任务
We need to get in and get out before anyone knows we're there.

51
00:03:57,049 --> 00:03:58,134
陆军传染病医学研究院指挥中心
USAMRIID command.

52
00:03:58,134 --> 00:04:00,762
喂 我是狄克逊...告诉车队
Hey, it's Dixon... get word to the convoy.

53
00:04:00,762 --> 00:04:03,723
中止计划 中止计划 有人在窥视我们
Abort, a-abort. Someone's snooping around.

54
00:04:03,723 --> 00:04:05,433
高速公路再过两个街区就到了
Highway's just two blocks up.

55
00:04:06,142 --> 00:04:07,602
91探戈 中止计划
91-Tango Abort.

56
00:04:07,602 --> 00:04:08,519
接收到狄克逊的消息
Got word from Dixon.

57
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:09,854
有人在该区域内
Someone is on the premises.

58
00:04:09,854 --> 00:04:10,897
我是贾克斯上校
This is Colonel Jaax.

59
00:04:10,897 --> 00:04:12,565
他为什么不直接用无线电通知我们
Why didn't he radio us directly?

60
00:04:12,565 --> 00:04:14,859
雷斯顿可能超出信号范围了 长官
It's possible Reston is out of range, sir.

61
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:16,694
我现在和信号小组确认下
Checking with ASE Ops now.

62
00:04:16,903 --> 00:04:18,279
这事不能等
This isn't something we wait on.

63
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,031
已经拖了太久了
It's been stalled too long already.

64
00:04:20,031 --> 00:04:21,908
我们得到的明确指示是避免暴露
Express orders to avoid exposure.

65
00:04:21,908 --> 00:04:23,367
不要引起公众恐慌
Not stir up any public panic.

66
00:04:23,367 --> 00:04:24,869
南希能分得清轻重缓急...
Nancy understands the urgency...

67
00:04:24,869 --> 00:04:26,746
我才是这次行动的指挥官
I am in command of this mission.

68
00:04:26,746 --> 00:04:28,664
你要对南希负责 要尊重这一点
You're going to do right by Nancy and honor that.

69
00:04:28,664 --> 00:04:32,710
她为你担保 你做的一切都算在她头上
She vouched for you. Every move you make is on her.

70
00:04:33,961 --> 00:04:37,799
-上校 是否中止计划  -不 等一下
-Colonel, do we abort? -No, not yet.

71
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,802
狄克逊 状况如何
Dixon, what's your status?

72
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:45,139
我是邮报的
I'm from the Post.

73
00:04:46,224 --> 00:04:49,018
你知道这里爆发了什么吗
Do you know anything about an outbreak here?

74
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:52,396
我保证不会泄露我的线人...
I promise I won't reveal my sources...

75
00:04:52,396 --> 00:04:54,607
不知道 我只是个夜猫子
Uh, no, I-I'm just the night guy.

76
00:04:54,607 --> 00:04:56,025
出来走走看看
Just keep an eye on the place.

77
00:04:56,025 --> 00:04:56,901
真的吗
Really.

78
00:04:58,528 --> 00:05:00,363
你确定什么都没有看见吗
You sure you haven't seen anything?

79
00:05:00,363 --> 00:05:02,073
一点奇怪的都没有
Nothing strange at all?

80
00:05:02,073 --> 00:05:05,618
是的 很安静 和平常一样
No, all quiet. As usual.

81
00:05:06,035 --> 00:05:09,539
你非常快地从车里跳出来 跑到这里来
Hey, you jumped out of your car pretty quickly, bolted over here.

82
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:10,498
狄克逊
Dixon.

83
00:05:10,665 --> 00:05:11,874
你在和谁通电话
Who you on the phone with?

84
00:05:13,084 --> 00:05:14,293
我女朋友
My girlfriend.

85
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,253
狄克逊
Dixon.

86
00:05:15,628 --> 00:05:17,338
她总是想查我的岗...
She always wants me to check in...

87
00:05:17,505 --> 00:05:20,591
她要是在电话这头听到另一个女人的声音会杀了我的
She'd kill me if she heard another woman's voice on the end of this line.

88
00:05:23,803 --> 00:05:25,054
状态更新
Status update.

89
00:05:25,054 --> 00:05:27,390
他还没回应 长官 等一下
He's not responding sir, standby.

90
00:05:32,728 --> 00:05:34,814
你要是看见了什么 打给我
If you see anything, call me.

91
00:05:37,483 --> 00:05:38,860
别傻站着
Don't freeze out here.

92
00:05:48,494 --> 00:05:51,455
狄克逊 请回复 发生什么了
Dixon, respond. What the hell is going on?

93
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:53,291
等一下
Just, just hang on a second.

94
00:05:56,961 --> 00:05:58,713
上校 中止计划吗
Colonel, do we abort?

95
00:05:58,713 --> 00:06:00,548
通过上匝道 等下一个
Pass this on-ramp. Wait for the next.

96
00:06:00,548 --> 00:06:01,549
去下一个
Go to the next one.

97
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,387
必须尽快 不然就晚了
This has to happen, sooner rather than later.

98
00:06:06,387 --> 00:06:08,514
越快大家就越安全
Sooner is safer for everyone.

99
00:06:08,514 --> 00:06:09,849
我说了等一下
I say we wait.

100
00:06:20,693 --> 00:06:21,569
等一下
Hold on.

101
00:06:24,322 --> 00:06:26,157
好了 她走了
We're good, she's leaving.

102
00:06:27,825 --> 00:06:29,076
可以继续了 长官
All clear to proceed, sir.

103
00:06:29,076 --> 00:06:31,120
记者已经离开了
Reporter has left the premises.

104
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:32,997
收到
Roger that.

105
00:06:42,173 --> 00:06:43,299
博萨是对的
Bosa was right.

106
00:06:44,383 --> 00:06:49,722
隔离是唯一能阻止病毒传播的方法
Isolation is the only thing that stops this thing spreading.

107
00:06:51,515 --> 00:06:53,893
这病毒到底是从哪里冒出来的
How does a virus like this just come out of nowhere?

108
00:06:53,893 --> 00:06:55,227
不是无中生有
It wasn't nowhere.

109
00:06:55,227 --> 00:07:00,149
有些病毒在猪 蝙蝠 猴子身上有上千年了
There's been viruses in pigs, bats, monkeys, for thousands of years.

110
00:07:01,317 --> 00:07:04,320
但是 当你拆了它们的家 它们就会相继死去
But when you cut down their homes and they die off,

111
00:07:05,655 --> 00:07:07,406
怪物总要找个地方躲起来
the monsters got to hide somewhere.

112
00:07:08,157 --> 00:07:09,241
怪物
Monster?

113
00:07:09,742 --> 00:07:12,370
你见过什么能把身体弄成这样的吗
You ever seen anything destroy a body like this?

114
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,829
真是个完美的杀手
It's the perfect killer.

115
00:07:14,956 --> 00:07:17,708
但它的"阿基里斯之踵"[致命弱点]可能是 它在人身上烧得太快
But its Achilles' heel may be it burns through people so fast

116
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,752
也就害死了自己
it snuffs itself out.

117
00:07:21,253 --> 00:07:24,340
如果这病毒能在攻击人体之前
If this thing ever evolves to live in a human longer

118
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,008
进化到能在人体内存活更长时间
before it attacks the body,

119
00:07:26,884 --> 00:07:30,137
那它的传播速度我们就完全跟不上了
it could spread faster than we could ever keep up with.

120
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:47,822
厄普斯特德 请到2号麻醉室
Upstead. Your anesthesiology code 2.

121
00:07:47,947 --> 00:07:50,866
厄普斯特德 请到2号麻醉室
Upstead again anesthesiology code 2.

122
00:08:02,003 --> 00:08:04,171
好了 把袖子卷上去
Okay. Roll up your sleeves.

123
00:08:10,428 --> 00:08:11,887
我的丈夫会死吗
Is my husband going to die?

124
00:08:12,972 --> 00:08:14,390
多曼斯基夫人...
Mrs. Domanski...

125
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:18,227
因为我听到出事了 我有三个孩子...
'Cause I've been hearing things and I have three kids...

126
00:08:18,936 --> 00:08:21,480
布鲁斯和我经历过一些曲折 但我...
and Bruce and I have had our ups and downs but I...

127
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:24,191
我没法想象没有他 我该怎么熬过这一切…
I can't imagine going through all of this without him...

128
00:08:24,191 --> 00:08:25,735
你孩子都几岁了
How old are your kids?

129
00:08:28,237 --> 00:08:32,575
17岁 14岁 还有个9岁
They're, uh, 17, 14 and nine.

130
00:08:33,576 --> 00:08:35,119
他们一定吓坏了...
They must be scared...

131
00:08:36,871 --> 00:08:39,790
你陪着他们 我们都是为你丈夫而来的
Just be there for them and know that we're here for your husband.

132
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:43,169
他...他很稳定 没有发烧
He...he's steady. He hasn't spiked a fever.

133
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:48,007
失陪一下
Would you excuse me?

134
00:08:48,007 --> 00:08:49,467
护士 能把那个给你吗
Nurse, could I give you that?

135
00:08:49,467 --> 00:08:50,593
你归一下档吧 谢谢
Could you file that? Thank you.

136
00:08:50,593 --> 00:08:52,136
我们得扩大扫除规模
We need to do a wider sweep.

137
00:08:52,136 --> 00:08:53,763
在我们把工人带到这里之前
There's no telling how many people

138
00:08:53,763 --> 00:08:56,182
还不知道他们接触了多少人
the workers had contact with before we got them here.

139
00:08:56,348 --> 00:08:59,602
在扩大范围之前 我们得先看看是否有人感染
We need to see if any are even infected before we go wider.

140
00:09:00,102 --> 00:09:01,437
另外 我们还要注意时间
Besides, we have a ticking clock on

141
00:09:01,437 --> 00:09:03,773
还能要求这些人呆多久
how long we can even ask these people to stay.

142
00:09:05,357 --> 00:09:07,151
有多少人出现症状了
How many have shown symptoms?

143
00:09:07,401 --> 00:09:08,194
没人
None.

144
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,658
零症状
Zero symptoms.

145
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:17,787
继续测试吧 如果你想要见识疫情爆发
Run your tests, but if you're looking for an outbreak,

146
00:09:17,787 --> 00:09:19,413
这里可见不到
you're not gonna find it here.

147
00:09:50,861 --> 00:09:52,196
你在开玩笑吧
You got to be kidding me.

148
00:09:52,488 --> 00:09:54,657
不是应该有人关闭游乐场吗
Wasn't someone supposed to close the playground?

149
00:09:54,907 --> 00:09:56,325
现在来不及了
It's too late now.

150
00:09:58,452 --> 00:10:01,956
长官 我是狄克逊中尉 他们让我守着前面
Sir! Lieutenant Dixon, sir. They had me at the front.

151
00:10:01,956 --> 00:10:03,332
感谢你的盯梢 狄克逊
Thanks for keeping an eye out, Dixon.

152
00:10:03,332 --> 00:10:04,750
我知道我没有参加完整的简报
I know I haven't had the full briefing,

153
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,293
但我以前穿过防护服
but I've had some experience in Racals.

154
00:10:06,293 --> 00:10:07,878
我真的很想和大家一起进去
I really want to get in there with my team.

155
00:10:07,878 --> 00:10:10,047
理解 但整个团队必须得协同工作
Understood. But the whole team's gotta work as a unit.

156
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,715
所有人都分配好任务了
Everyone's assigned already.

157
00:10:12,341 --> 00:10:14,301
我们这次确实需要你看着那边
We do need you on the other side this time.

158
00:10:15,386 --> 00:10:17,096
啊... 好的 长官
Ah man... Uh, yes, sir.

159
00:10:17,096 --> 00:10:18,264
我们抓紧
Let's step it up.

160
00:10:40,578 --> 00:10:42,705
我们需要把这些送到第四级
We need to take these into BL4.

161
00:10:43,038 --> 00:10:44,081
那些是从医院来的吗
Are those from the hospital?

162
00:10:44,081 --> 00:10:46,167
是的... 我们要测的血样
Yeah... blood samples we need to test.

163
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:49,170
所有接触人员和直系亲属
All contacts and immediate family members.

164
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,797
你们上次睡觉是什么时候
When was the last time you two slept?

165
00:10:52,923 --> 00:10:55,301
我们俩轮班
Uh, we've been taking shifts.

166
00:10:55,926 --> 00:10:59,430
问题是 办公椅不是很舒服
Problem is, the office chairs aren't really that comfy.

167
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,265
很难让大脑不去高速运转
It's hard to keep the mind from racing.

168
00:11:01,265 --> 00:11:04,894
-还在担心吗  -多亏了工作
-And the anxiety? -Well, work helps.

169
00:11:05,603 --> 00:11:07,479
问题是 我们停滞不前
Problem is, we're at a standstill.

170
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:08,647
雷斯顿那边什么都没送来
There's nothing in from Reston.

171
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:11,400
-还没东西送来吗  -有点延误了
-No deliveries yet? -Some kind of delay.

172
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,027
我不知道 他们甚至还没有进入大楼
I don't know, they haven't even entered the building.

173
00:11:13,027 --> 00:11:13,944
我们必须得进去
We've got to get in there.

174
00:11:13,944 --> 00:11:16,197
我们得知道这件事到底进展如何了
We need to know what's going on with this thing.

175
00:11:16,864 --> 00:11:18,199
症状...
Something's off...

176
00:11:18,866 --> 00:11:20,075
有些不对劲
the symptoms.

177
00:11:21,619 --> 00:11:23,287
你们今天测试自己了吗
Have you tested yourselves today?

178
00:11:24,455 --> 00:11:26,040
是啊 我们本来准备要测的 但...
I mean, yeah, we were going to but...

179
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,460
我们收到了铺天盖地的动物样本
It's like, we got thousands of animal samples incoming,

180
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,003
加上你带进来的血样...
plus all this blood that you're bringing in...

181
00:11:31,003 --> 00:11:32,463
我们觉得应该没时间检测自己了
We didn't think there was going to be time.

182
00:11:32,463 --> 00:11:34,215
是啊 但你得抽出时间
Yeah, well, you need to make the time.

183
00:11:35,049 --> 00:11:40,095
听着 我知道这很可怕 但在我们进去之前你得先测
Look, I know this is scary but you need to do it before we go in there.

184
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:41,597
是啊
Yeah.

185
00:11:42,223 --> 00:11:43,432
我去穿衣服
I'm going to suit up.

186
00:12:13,128 --> 00:12:15,589
你觉得我们中有多少人被感染了
How many of us do you think have it?

187
00:12:17,132 --> 00:12:18,425
我猜很快就知道了
Guess we'll know soon.

188
00:12:20,219 --> 00:12:22,388
你爸爸担心过会发生这样的事吗
Your dad ever worry something like this would happen?

189
00:12:22,388 --> 00:12:26,308
不 他只是喜欢照顾动物
Naw, he just liked taking care of the animals.

190
00:12:26,892 --> 00:12:29,937
他说如果你找的话 会发现每一种都有有趣的怪癖
Said each one had a funny quirk if you looked for it.

191
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,280
谢了...
Thanks...

192
00:13:03,012 --> 00:13:04,388
好了 伙计们 听好了
All right, guys, listen up.

193
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,515
这里是我们的突破口
This will be our sally port here.

194
00:13:06,515 --> 00:13:08,350
完成了自己的消毒任务就来这儿
You come through here once you've deconned out.

195
00:13:09,018 --> 00:13:12,646
我们将用胶带封住走廊的一部分 那儿就是灰色地带
We'll tape off a portion of the hallway for our grey zone.

196
00:13:12,646 --> 00:13:14,565
是我们和外部的缓冲区
Our buffer to the outside world.

197
00:13:14,565 --> 00:13:17,318
媒体在找我们 周围还有住户...
We're on the radar of the press and we got neighbors...

198
00:13:17,318 --> 00:13:21,280
很多人盯着我们 不要穿着防护服走出这个机构
lot of eyes on us, so no one comes out of this facility in a suit.

199
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,282
里面的暖气仍是失灵状态
Inside, heating is still malfunctioning.

200
00:13:23,282 --> 00:13:25,075
估计还有电力问题 所以...
Expecting issues with the electrical, so...

201
00:13:25,075 --> 00:13:26,243
我们用手电筒
We'll go by flashlight.

202
00:13:26,243 --> 00:13:29,663
房顶的灯不能用 所以会一路放置提灯
Can't use headlamps with the hoods, so we'll drop lanterns along the way,

203
00:13:29,788 --> 00:13:31,165
每个房间两个
two in every room.

204
00:13:31,165 --> 00:13:35,294
第一队打镇定剂 每个房间一个
The first team will be sedation, stationed one in every cell

205
00:13:35,294 --> 00:13:36,962
直到动物全被清走
until each animal has been removed.

206
00:13:36,962 --> 00:13:39,214
下一步 我们在这儿设置解剖小组
Next, we'll set up the dissection team here.

207
00:13:39,214 --> 00:13:41,091
卡特会监管这个房间
Carter will supervise this room.

208
00:13:41,091 --> 00:13:42,676
它们的速度会很快
They're coming fast.

209
00:13:42,676 --> 00:13:47,222
一共500只 但你只需要专注于你面前的那只
500 by the end, but you just concentrate on the one in front of you.

210
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,350
采完血样后
After we take blood samples,

211
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,894
每只动物都会被送去安乐死
each animal will be brought to the euthanization station.

212
00:13:51,894 --> 00:13:55,481
它们沉睡后 我们采组织样本
After they're put to sleep, we take tissue samples.

213
00:13:55,773 --> 00:13:57,107
会有很多的血
There'll be a a lot of blood.

214
00:13:57,107 --> 00:13:58,317
感染的血液
Infected blood.

215
00:13:58,317 --> 00:13:59,860
如果你的防护服沾上了
If you get any on your suit,

216
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,613
停止你的工作 用消毒水它擦掉
stop what you're doing, and wipe it off with bleach.

217
00:14:02,613 --> 00:14:05,657
这个病毒不像艾滋
The virus isn't like HIV.

218
00:14:05,908 --> 00:14:09,328
一旦它进入空气 它可以活跃好几天
Once it hits the air, it can stay active for days.

219
00:14:09,328 --> 00:14:11,121
我们现在就穿上防护服进去
We'll suit up to go into the building now.

220
00:14:11,121 --> 00:14:13,957
在封锁灰色地带之前 整个地方可能都很热
The whole place might be hot until we can secure this grey zone.

221
00:14:13,957 --> 00:14:17,461
无论你有什么原因要出去 我们都会让你出去的
If you need to get out for any reason, we'll get you out.

222
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:19,797
有疑问吗
Any questions?

223
00:14:33,977 --> 00:14:35,354
确保胶带粘紧了
Make sure the tape is on tight.

224
00:14:35,354 --> 00:14:36,772
封住每道缝隙
Cover very seal.

225
00:14:41,276 --> 00:14:42,528
好了
Okay.

226
00:15:25,821 --> 00:15:29,867
我们现在离开突破口 进入灰色地带
We're now leaving the Sally Port, and entering the Grey Zone.

227
00:15:31,827 --> 00:15:33,745
14-1-4 让他们和我保持联系
14-1-4. Keep me at them.

228
00:15:36,582 --> 00:15:39,793
这里是缓冲带 所有病毒一律不准进入这里
This is the buffer. Nothing hot comes in here.

229
00:15:39,793 --> 00:15:41,795
我们还要消毒
We'll need to sterilize as well.

230
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:55,017
把消毒设备放在这里
We'll set up Decon through here.

231
00:16:08,822 --> 00:16:10,157
好了 重点来了
All right, heads up.

232
00:16:10,157 --> 00:16:12,451
这扇门后面就是最致命病毒隔离区
Beyond this door is the Hot Zone.

233
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:16,997
一旦进入这个区域 你的衣物就会被污染
Once you pass into the Hot Zone, your suits will be contaminated.

234
00:16:17,331 --> 00:16:21,960
出来以后 请把衣物装进袋子 然后烧毁
When you're heading out, after Decon, bag them and burn them.

235
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,045
懂了吗
Okay?

236
00:16:23,045 --> 00:16:26,173
把设备搬进来 我们要封上这扇门
Get the equipment in. We need to sheet this doorway.

237
00:16:26,173 --> 00:16:27,049
是 长官
Yes, sir!

238
00:17:12,469 --> 00:17:13,720
测试下空气开关
Trying the breaker.

239
00:17:17,891 --> 00:17:19,560
不好 搞坏了
Nope. We blew it out.

240
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,645
我们只有用应急灯了
All we have are the emergency lights.

241
00:17:25,649 --> 00:17:29,861
好 把灯装好 再把冷却机卸下来
Okay, let's get some lights set up and start unloading those coolers.

242
00:17:29,861 --> 00:17:32,573
收到 是2-20型的
Roger that. That's a 2-20.

243
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,791
笼子有空的吗
Are some of these empty?

244
00:18:40,307 --> 00:18:41,892
你没事 你没事
You're okay. You're okay.

245
00:18:47,439 --> 00:18:48,774
哦 该死
Oh, hell no.

246
00:18:48,774 --> 00:18:50,108
是猴子把这个扔到你身上的吗
Did one of them throw that at you?

247
00:18:50,108 --> 00:18:52,319
反正我自己没扔
Well, I didn't throw it at myself.

248
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:55,697
它们用尽了方法来表达恐惧
They're using whatever means they have to express distress.

249
00:18:55,989 --> 00:18:58,575
每一个污点都布满了病毒
Every smear is hot as can be.

250
00:18:58,575 --> 00:19:01,912
谁都不准碰 把你的衣服消一下毒
No one touch it. And bleach that off your suit.

251
00:19:01,912 --> 00:19:04,790
我身上到处都是病毒 千万不要碰我
I'm going go with everything is hot and don't touch anything.

252
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,918
我们反应越大 它们越会不依不饶
The more we react, the more they'll continue.

253
00:19:07,918 --> 00:19:09,503
所以 保持冷静
So, stay calm.

254
00:19:11,046 --> 00:19:11,630
好了 各位
All right, guys.

255
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,632
去拿镇静剂
Go get the sedation equipment.

256
00:19:16,635 --> 00:19:19,596
这里的很多动物都表现得很暴力
Lot of these animals are exhibiting violent behavior.

257
00:19:19,596 --> 00:19:21,473
对环境的变化异常敏感
Acute awareness of their surroundings.

258
00:19:21,473 --> 00:19:22,933
其中一些并没有感染病毒
They're healthy, some of them.

259
00:19:22,933 --> 00:19:26,144
但如果你想拯救任何一只 请打消这个念头
If you were thinking of saving any of these, forget it.

260
00:19:26,144 --> 00:19:27,604
他们并不是人类 他们只是猴子
These aren't humans. They're monkeys.

261
00:19:27,604 --> 00:19:29,523
我的工作是对人类和猴子一视同仁
My job is to not see the difference.

262
00:19:29,523 --> 00:19:31,983
听着 你来自一个道德高尚的组织
Look, you're coming from a good place.

263
00:19:32,109 --> 00:19:35,153
但我们根本没有时间
But we don't have the time to differentiate

264
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:37,864
去分辨哪些猴子感染了 哪些没有
between those infected and those who aren't...

265
00:19:37,864 --> 00:19:39,533
任何一只都有可能已经被感染了
Everyone of one of them could have it.

266
00:20:08,645 --> 00:20:09,771
找到一个
I've got one.

267
00:20:10,981 --> 00:20:11,898
确定吗
You sure?

268
00:20:12,566 --> 00:20:14,359
我也不喜欢我的显微镜下看到的东西
I don't like what I'm seeing over here either.

269
00:20:18,405 --> 00:20:19,740
两个新增病例
Two new cases.

270
00:20:20,407 --> 00:20:22,242
上帝啊 我们应该警告雷斯顿
Christ. We've got to alert Reston.

271
00:20:22,659 --> 00:20:23,660
我们要给其他人都做测试
We should test the rest.

272
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,746
看看我们总共感染了多少例
See how many infections we have in total.

273
00:20:26,329 --> 00:20:27,831
我去给医院打电话
I got to call the hospital.

274
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,544
我是贾克斯 给我接罗德斯
This is Jaax, get me Rhodes.

275
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:36,173
西护士站 请致电观察室
Nurses station west, please call OCU.

276
00:20:36,465 --> 00:20:39,342
西护士站 请致电观察室
Nurses station west, please call OCU.

277
00:20:41,928 --> 00:20:42,929
喂
Hello.

278
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:01,364
好 不 不 好了
Okay. No, no. Okay.

279
00:21:18,256 --> 00:21:21,259
我们必须继续做测试
We have to go down tests.

280
00:21:31,228 --> 00:21:33,814
不 你们等在这里
No, no. Just wait here.

281
00:21:41,613 --> 00:21:43,073
他们在那里堆木棍
They're laying sticks down.

282
00:21:43,198 --> 00:21:45,283
又有两个家庭感染了病毒
There's two more families infected.

283
00:21:46,201 --> 00:21:48,537
大家都在躲着我们 就像躲那家人一样
We're being shunned, just like the family.

284
00:21:49,538 --> 00:21:51,039
嘿 我们需要抹布
Hey, we need those rags!

285
00:21:51,498 --> 00:21:53,583
时间到了 孩子要生了
It's time. The baby's coming.

286
00:21:55,836 --> 00:21:57,045
你能来帮忙吗
You going to lend a hand?

287
00:21:59,506 --> 00:22:01,383
病毒就是希望你现在去插手
That's exactly what it wants you to do.

288
00:22:03,093 --> 00:22:05,011
让自己暴露 靠近它们
Expose yourself, get close.

289
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:09,057
那女人和孩子已经没救了
The woman and baby are lost.

290
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,726
他们都没救了
They're all lost.

291
00:22:24,865 --> 00:22:27,158
告诉她 她必须试着把呼吸放缓
Tell her she has to try and slow her breathing down.

292
00:22:43,592 --> 00:22:46,052
叫她深呼吸
Tell her to take deep breathes.

293
00:22:49,389 --> 00:22:50,974
好了 她开始大出血了
All right, she's hemorrhaging.

294
00:22:55,979 --> 00:22:57,939
她要生了 孩子要出来了
She's crowning. It's time.

295
00:22:57,939 --> 00:23:01,192
叫她用力推 你要用力推啊 懂吗
Tell her she has to push. You have to push. Okay?

296
00:23:01,902 --> 00:23:03,445
对了 就这样
That's it! That's it!

297
00:23:03,445 --> 00:23:05,864
深呼吸 用力推
Deep breathes and push hard!

298
00:23:06,615 --> 00:23:07,616
你可以的
You can do it!

299
00:23:08,325 --> 00:23:10,911
加油 加油 再用力推一下
Come on! Come on! One big push.

300
00:23:12,746 --> 00:23:15,165
就这样 很好 非常棒
That's it. That's good, that's good.

301
00:23:18,043 --> 00:23:21,421
加油 很好 呼吸 呼吸
Come on. That's good, breathe. Breathe.

302
00:23:21,588 --> 00:23:22,505
继续呼吸
Breathe.

303
00:23:23,089 --> 00:23:25,842
最后再推一次 用尽全力推
One last push. One last big push.

304
00:23:25,842 --> 00:23:27,260
对了 加油
That's it. Come on!

305
00:23:51,993 --> 00:23:55,914
戈迪 能跟你说几句吗
Gordy. Could I have a word?

306
00:23:57,582 --> 00:23:59,751
还有杰尼丝
Uh, and-and Janice.

307
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,757
没事的 我一定会没事的
It's okay. It's going to be okay.

308
00:24:06,007 --> 00:24:07,926
整个教区的人都在为我们祈祷
We got the whole parish praying for us.

309
00:24:16,393 --> 00:24:18,895
这周由爸爸照顾你们 所以...
Your dad has you this week, so...

310
00:24:22,399 --> 00:24:26,236
你去打电话给他 告诉他文件在柜子里
you should call him, tell him about the files in the closet.

311
00:24:26,236 --> 00:24:26,611
妈妈...
Mom...?

312
00:24:26,611 --> 00:24:28,154
去告诉他
Just tell him.

313
00:24:29,406 --> 00:24:30,657
一定不会有事的
Nothing's going to happen.

314
00:24:30,657 --> 00:24:34,494
也许吧 不过以防万一...
Maybe not. But just in case...

315
00:24:38,081 --> 00:24:39,666
我爱你
I love you.

316
00:24:53,346 --> 00:24:56,766
前往"探戈酒店"
Proceed to hotel tango.

317
00:24:57,475 --> 00:24:59,227
好了 镇静剂小组听好了
All right, sedation team, listen up.

318
00:24:59,227 --> 00:25:00,854
艾瑞森中士是你们的组长
Sergeant Ericson is your lead.

319
00:25:00,854 --> 00:25:03,314
他会安排休息 今天会是很难熬的一天
He'll monitor breaks. This is gonna be a long day.

320
00:25:03,314 --> 00:25:08,028
工作45分钟后强制休息15分钟 绝对不要忘记你的搭档
Mandatory 15 minutes every 45. Never forget your buddy.

321
00:25:08,028 --> 00:25:10,447
记住 你们不是一个人 你们是两人一体
Remember, you're not one, you're two.

322
00:25:10,447 --> 00:25:12,490
第一个人负责打开笼子
The first person to the cage will open it,

323
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:14,576
确保没有任何障碍物
making sure that there's no obstruction.

324
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,912
第二个人拿杆子...
The second one will position the pole...

325
00:25:17,912 --> 00:25:18,329
-懂了吗  -懂了
-You got it?  -Yeah.

326
00:25:18,329 --> 00:25:21,291
一旦笼门打开 你就要马上控制住猴子
So that as soon as the door is open you've got it right there

327
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:23,126
防止猴子逃跑
to prevent any chance of escape.

328
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:32,552
打完镇静剂的猴子将被送去安乐死
Sedated monkeys will be transported to the euthanizing station.

329
00:25:34,095 --> 00:25:35,930
好了 大家来整理一下桌面
All right, let's clear this up!

330
00:25:36,097 --> 00:25:38,308
我们需要一个整洁的工作台
So, We have a good work surface here!

331
00:25:38,641 --> 00:25:41,144
目前我们对这种病毒所知不多
Now, we don't know a lot about this virus.

332
00:25:41,853 --> 00:25:46,066
它是怎么传播的 如何侵入人体的 都不清楚
How it's spreading in here, how it's ravaging the body.

333
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:48,109
但我们有样本
But we get samples,

334
00:25:48,443 --> 00:25:51,696
也许下一次 这些猴子就能帮我们阻止病毒的传播了
and maybe these guys will help us stop this thing next time.

335
00:25:51,696 --> 00:25:53,990
也许我们还能找到治疗方法
Maybe we can help us find the cure.

336
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:57,535
趁猴子的心脏还在跳动的时候 在这里抽取血液样本
We'll take any blood samples here while the heart is still pumping,

337
00:25:57,535 --> 00:26:00,663
然后到那里注射安乐死针剂
and then we'll inject the euthanizing agent over here.

338
00:26:01,331 --> 00:26:04,876
最后送到这里进行解剖
After that, they're taken here for dissection.

339
00:26:04,876 --> 00:26:06,086
工作完成
End of the line.

340
00:26:06,336 --> 00:26:09,214
每只猴子身上要提取至少五份样本
We need up to five samples from each.

341
00:26:09,547 --> 00:26:12,425
每份样本都要标注采自哪只猴子
Each tagged and labeled per monkey.

342
00:26:20,975 --> 00:26:23,770
工作结束后 将尸体进行三层包裹
When we're done, we triple-bag each body.

343
00:26:23,937 --> 00:26:25,605
准备拿去烧毁
Prepare it for incineration.

344
00:26:27,065 --> 00:26:28,983
所有表面都要消毒
We bleach every surface.

345
00:26:28,983 --> 00:26:33,363
先用几加仑消毒剂清洗管道 然后每排出一次污血
Prime the drains with a couple of gallons, then every time blood goes down,

346
00:26:33,363 --> 00:26:35,281
再倒一罐消毒剂
follow it with another jug.

347
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:40,620
可以注射了
Bring in your syringe pole.

348
00:26:42,038 --> 00:26:44,499
我知道里面已经很危险了 但是相信我
I know it's already hot in here, but trust me:

349
00:26:44,499 --> 00:26:46,084
还会更糟的
It's going to get worse.

350
00:26:46,084 --> 00:26:47,627
所以 把握好自己的节奏
So, pace yourself.

351
00:26:52,715 --> 00:26:54,008
慢慢来...
Easy, easy...

352
00:26:59,556 --> 00:27:00,390
成功
Got it!

353
00:27:55,987 --> 00:27:58,990
我从来没想过 你会是那个在这看表的人
I never knew you to be one to watch the time down here.

354
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:00,408
杰瑞说他会报个平安的
Jerry said he'd check in.

355
00:28:00,408 --> 00:28:02,368
听着 我相信肯定会没事的
Look, I'm sure everything's fine.

356
00:28:02,785 --> 00:28:07,207
这是雷斯顿送来的第一批 "一批猴子身上的样本"
It's the first batch from Reston, "samples from a dozen monkeys."

357
00:28:10,543 --> 00:28:12,545
我开始觉得卡特说的有道理了
I'm starting to think that Carter had a point.

358
00:28:12,545 --> 00:28:13,963
还有罗德斯说的
So did Rhodes.

359
00:28:16,216 --> 00:28:19,052
这种伊波拉病毒跟之前的有一些非常不同的地方
There's something very different about this Ebola virus.

360
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:22,972
阳性反应
It glowed.

361
00:28:24,182 --> 00:28:27,060
绝对不可能在猴子身上有这种症状
There's no way this could be happening to these monkeys,

362
00:28:27,435 --> 00:28:29,562
而人体却最多只是发烧
and no human's shown more than a fever.

363
00:28:30,188 --> 00:28:33,775
四例阳性病人伴有头痛 但是没有呕吐 没有出血吗
Four positive cases and headaches, no vomiting, no hemorrhaging?

364
00:28:33,775 --> 00:28:35,860
其他人本来应该生病的
Someone along the way would have gotten sick...

365
00:28:36,277 --> 00:28:39,697
可能是因为潜伏期更长才没有生病
could be that nobody's sick because the incubation time is longer.

366
00:28:40,323 --> 00:28:44,077
在症状出现前会传染给更多人
Spreading to a lot of people before any symptoms appear.

367
00:28:47,288 --> 00:28:49,290
喂 你太累了吧
Hey. You're exhausted.

368
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:52,335
去吧 我来收拾  好吗
Go. I'll clean up. Okay?

369
00:28:52,543 --> 00:28:54,003
我再待几分钟
I'll just be a few minutes.

370
00:28:54,754 --> 00:28:56,589
好的 谢谢 谢了
Okay. Thank you. Thanks.

371
00:28:56,589 --> 00:28:57,715
我随后就来
I'll be right behind you.

372
00:29:44,512 --> 00:29:45,805
看起来已经不动了
Doesn't look like it's moving much.

373
00:29:45,805 --> 00:29:47,932
嗯 我也觉得它不动了
No. I don't see it moving.

374
00:29:50,643 --> 00:29:52,270
快抓 它要逃跑了
Get it! He's getting away!

375
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:54,605
萨拉 我们得把这只控制住 我先给他打完针
Sarah, we need to get this one down first. Let me inject it!

376
00:29:54,605 --> 00:29:55,857
不 我们得...
No, We have to...

377
00:29:59,444 --> 00:30:01,779
他妈的为什么要把两只放在一个笼子里
Why the hell did they put two in one cage?

378
00:30:06,534 --> 00:30:08,119
我们得从卡车里再拿点标签出来
We're going to need more tags out of the truck.

379
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:09,329
快关门
Shut the door!

380
00:30:09,329 --> 00:30:09,996
什么
What?!

381
00:30:10,413 --> 00:30:11,247
往门那儿跑了
Going for the door!

382
00:30:11,247 --> 00:30:12,582
快关门
Shut the door!

383
00:30:17,045 --> 00:30:18,963
上校 有一只逃跑了
Colonel, one escaped!

384
00:30:19,422 --> 00:30:21,466
封锁出口 有一只逃跑了
Cover the exits. We've got a rogue!

385
00:30:21,466 --> 00:30:22,425
收到 长官
Yes, sir.

386
00:30:24,218 --> 00:30:26,179
-你还好吗  -嗯 我没事
Are you all right? -Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

387
00:30:28,514 --> 00:30:30,058
-奥曼  -什么
- Orman. - What?

388
00:30:30,433 --> 00:30:32,602
这是猴子的还是你的血
Is this from a monkey or is that your blood?

389
00:30:33,686 --> 00:30:35,605
不 这肯定是哪个样本的 或者...
No, it must be from one of the samples or...

390
00:30:40,109 --> 00:30:41,486
封闭前请分流
Routing before air lock.

391
00:30:41,486 --> 00:30:43,154
第二批
Secondary hatch.

392
00:30:49,369 --> 00:30:50,286
彼得
Peter!

393
00:30:51,329 --> 00:30:52,747
醒醒 你得赶紧出去
Wake up, you've got to get out of here.

394
00:30:52,747 --> 00:30:53,623
走吧
Come on.

395
00:30:55,208 --> 00:30:58,795
我不能再失去其他人了 特别是你
I can't lose anyone else go. Especially not you.

396
00:30:59,337 --> 00:31:01,964
-等等 "再失去"是什么意思  -我们刚收到消息
-Wait, anybody else?  -We've got incoming.

397
00:31:01,964 --> 00:31:03,549
雷斯顿那里出事了吗
A breach at Reston?

398
00:31:03,841 --> 00:31:04,425
还不知道
I don't know.

399
00:31:04,425 --> 00:31:07,178
我只知道他们马上会有人过来 而且直接送到隔离室
All I know is they're coming in and they're going to the Slammer.

400
00:31:07,178 --> 00:31:08,638
你还好吗 看着我
You okay? Look at me.

401
00:31:09,055 --> 00:31:10,014
我没事
I'm okay.

402
00:31:11,682 --> 00:31:13,059
都在D区
Both in D gone.

403
00:31:13,059 --> 00:31:14,602
B10 跟紧我
Bravo ten, stick with me.

404
00:31:24,237 --> 00:31:26,906
狄克逊 我们这儿有只猴子跑了
Dixon. We have an escaped monkey.

405
00:31:27,657 --> 00:31:29,283
可能去了通风口
It might be going for the vents.

406
00:31:29,283 --> 00:31:30,159
你上屋顶
Get up on the roof.

407
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:31,911
收...收到
Uh... c-copy that.

408
00:32:18,958 --> 00:32:21,210
没事了 退后 别乱动
It's all right, get back! Stay still!

409
00:32:26,424 --> 00:32:29,719
我们不能让它跑出去 对面就是住宅 还有个操场
We can't let it out, there's houses across the street and a playground.

410
00:32:29,719 --> 00:32:30,970
威奇托 上屋顶
Wichita, get to the roof!

411
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:32,013
收到 长官
Yes, sir!

412
00:32:34,891 --> 00:32:36,851
它在逃跑 快跟上
It's on the move! Come on!

413
00:32:37,018 --> 00:32:39,061
手电照天花板
Keep your flashlights to the ceiling!

414
00:32:39,061 --> 00:32:40,438
这东西动作很快
This thing is quick!

415
00:32:40,688 --> 00:32:44,942
快点 注意头上
Come on! Heads up!

416
00:32:44,942 --> 00:32:46,611
如果看到了就大喊
Give out a shout if you see him!

417
00:32:46,736 --> 00:32:47,778
这儿 我看到了
Yeah, I got him!

418
00:32:50,156 --> 00:32:51,782
喂 在哪儿
Hey! Where is it?

419
00:32:51,782 --> 00:32:54,285
我不知道 我只知道有只猴子逃跑了
I don't know. All I know is a monkey escaped.

420
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:55,703
就在那
It's right there!

421
00:33:05,796 --> 00:33:07,924
看 那儿有个敞开的通风口
Look. There's an open vent.

422
00:33:09,842 --> 00:33:10,718
在这儿
There he is!

423
00:33:10,718 --> 00:33:12,512
我在这儿扎不到它
I can't jab him from here.

424
00:33:15,848 --> 00:33:17,183
它又跑了
He's on the move!

425
00:33:17,433 --> 00:33:20,353
往杆子那儿跑了 西南边
It's headed for the shaft. Southwest side.

426
00:33:23,064 --> 00:33:23,898
在那儿
There!

427
00:33:27,777 --> 00:33:28,903
快快快
Go, go, go!

428
00:33:38,788 --> 00:33:39,747
抓到了吗
You got it!?

429
00:33:51,259 --> 00:33:52,843
屋顶上的可以退后了
Stand down on the roof.

430
00:33:53,511 --> 00:33:54,428
我们抓到了
We got him.

431
00:34:19,287 --> 00:34:20,329
体征尚可
Vitals are okay.

432
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:21,414
血压升高
Blood pressure is rising.

433
00:34:21,414 --> 00:34:24,125
好 找人去通知一下
All right. And find anyone to notify.

434
00:34:52,069 --> 00:34:53,362
我不知道发生了什么
I don't know what happened.

435
00:34:53,362 --> 00:34:54,905
我一直非常小心
I was being so careful.

436
00:34:54,905 --> 00:34:57,908
没事的 这里的每个人都会照顾你
It's okay. Everyone here's going to look after you.

437
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:04,332
要21天吗 他们这么说的
21 days? That's what they said.

438
00:35:04,915 --> 00:35:07,752
别那么想 想想现在的事
Can't think like that. Stay present.

439
00:35:11,672 --> 00:35:13,424
这连个杂志都没有
There's not even a magazine.

440
00:35:14,216 --> 00:35:15,968
他们把这里收拾得可干净...
They clean this place up good...

441
00:35:15,968 --> 00:35:17,386
除了我什么都没有
Nothing to off myself with.

442
00:35:17,386 --> 00:35:21,182
我刚才怎么说的 别瞎想
What did I say? Get out of your head.

443
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,310
工厂里是怎么回事
What's going on in the facility?

444
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:30,191
我一直在想 这个处理猴子的任务
I thought this, this taking out those monkeys,

445
00:35:31,192 --> 00:35:33,194
可能就类似兽医学校里面任务比较重的一天...
it'd be like a hard day at vet school...

446
00:35:35,946 --> 00:35:37,073
但是它们的眼睛...
But their eyes...

447
00:35:38,658 --> 00:35:40,660
就好像盯着人类的眼睛一样...
it is like looking into another person...

448
00:35:42,536 --> 00:35:44,121
眼神是疯的
It's crazy in there.

449
00:35:45,164 --> 00:35:45,998
阴暗的
Dark.

450
00:35:46,666 --> 00:35:49,418
取暖设备坏了 每个人都累死了
Heat is all whacked out. Everyone is exhausted.

451
00:35:51,045 --> 00:35:52,254
简直一团乱
It's messed up.

452
00:35:56,842 --> 00:35:59,011
听我说 凯尔
Listen to me, Kyle.

453
00:35:59,011 --> 00:36:01,597
我每天都会过来 检查你的情况
I'm going to come back and check up on you every day,

454
00:36:01,764 --> 00:36:03,182
但是如果一旦觉得难以忍受了
but if it gets unbearable in there,

455
00:36:03,182 --> 00:36:04,141
我需要你深呼吸
I need you to breathe through it.

456
00:36:04,141 --> 00:36:06,102
就像我教你的那样 好吗
Like I taught you. Okay?

457
00:36:09,146 --> 00:36:10,356
深呼吸
Just breathe through it.

458
00:36:11,273 --> 00:36:12,316
我会回来的
I'll be back.

459
00:36:22,326 --> 00:36:25,371
91探戈队 我是贾克斯上校
91-Tango Unit. This is Colonel Jaax.

460
00:36:25,788 --> 00:36:28,457
嗨 听到你的声音真好
Hi. It's good to hear your voice.

461
00:36:30,793 --> 00:36:32,294
我们进来的时候晚了
We were late going in.

462
00:36:32,712 --> 00:36:35,339
听说了 听着 杰瑞...
I heard. Listen, Jerry...

463
00:36:35,506 --> 00:36:37,717
我测试了其余工人的血样
I tested the rest of the workers' blood.

464
00:36:37,717 --> 00:36:39,969
有两个新病例
We've got two new cases.

465
00:36:41,178 --> 00:36:42,054
好吧...
Okay...

466
00:36:45,057 --> 00:36:48,769
好吧 我们猜到了 不是吗
well, uh, that's not unexpected is it?

467
00:36:48,769 --> 00:36:49,603
是的
No.

468
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:53,441
但我们不知道有谁直接接触了体液 所以...
But we just don't know who had direct exposure through fluids so...

469
00:36:53,441 --> 00:36:56,444
好吧 我们会小心的 谢谢提醒
Okay, we'll be careful. Thanks for the heads up.

470
00:36:57,194 --> 00:36:59,530
我 我得进去了
I, uh, I got to get in there.

471
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:01,991
杰瑞 你还好吗
Hey, Jerry. You okay?

472
00:37:04,118 --> 00:37:07,621
嗯 我没事 我得挂了
Yeah, I'm fine. I, uh, I gotta go.

473
00:37:14,628 --> 00:37:15,504
长官
Sir?

474
00:37:15,713 --> 00:37:18,007
请求加入雷斯顿团队
Permission to join the team in Reston.

475
00:37:18,007 --> 00:37:20,676
我以为你和上校已经谈过了 南希
Thought you and the Colonel had already been through this, Nancy.

476
00:37:21,177 --> 00:37:23,220
是的 长官 但他没在这儿
Yes, sir, but he isn't here.

477
00:37:26,098 --> 00:37:30,853
91探戈队超常发挥 但他们需要帮助
91-Tangos are outperforming expectations but they need relief.

478
00:37:30,853 --> 00:37:33,939
杰瑞的一位关键队员现在进了隔离室
One of Jerry's key team members is now in the Slammer.

479
00:37:33,939 --> 00:37:37,777
就像您自己说的 卡特是我的责任
And as you said so yourself, Carter is my charge.

480
00:37:37,777 --> 00:37:40,237
我得进去看着他才行
Only right that I'd be in there to watch him.

481
00:37:56,295 --> 00:37:57,922
你发烧多久了
How long have you had a fever?

482
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,218
就一两天
Just a day or two,

483
00:38:02,218 --> 00:38:05,095
但是我孩子学校里有流感 所以...
but there's a flu going around my kid's school, so...

484
00:38:05,095 --> 00:38:07,139
好吧 现在是流感季 所以...
Yeah, well, it's flu season, so...

485
00:38:07,139 --> 00:38:08,599
你呢 感觉怎么样
What about you? How you feeling?

486
00:38:10,351 --> 00:38:11,227
我不知道
I don't know.

487
00:38:12,311 --> 00:38:15,481
感觉他们一直在把空调调低
It kind of feels like they keep turning on the A/C down here.

488
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,693
我们的测试 显示是...
I mean, our tests, they came back...

489
00:38:19,693 --> 00:38:21,821
是的 阴性的...
Yeah, they're negative but...

490
00:38:22,112 --> 00:38:24,323
但这玩意儿行为不同
this thing's acting different.

491
00:38:25,866 --> 00:38:26,867
它...
I mean, it's...

492
00:38:27,326 --> 00:38:29,078
症状出现得很慢
it's slow to show symptoms.

493
00:38:29,245 --> 00:38:29,870
我不知道...
I don't know...

494
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:31,872
感觉我要崩溃了
Feel like I am going to crack up.

495
00:38:33,415 --> 00:38:35,000
不知道我妈妈是怎么做到了
I don't know how my mom did it.

496
00:38:37,044 --> 00:38:39,755
她发现自己得了癌症
She found out she had cancer.

497
00:38:39,755 --> 00:38:41,882
知道毫无希望
She knew there was no hope.

498
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:44,260
知道了多久呢
Knew it for what?

499
00:38:44,885 --> 00:38:47,096
八 九个月
Eight, ten months.

500
00:38:47,263 --> 00:38:51,892
而我们才多久呢 两天多一点
And for us it's been, what? A little over two days.

501
00:38:51,892 --> 00:38:53,811
我觉得是因为我们被困在这儿 但是...
I think it's 'cause we're locked down here, but...

502
00:38:55,646 --> 00:38:59,650
我的思想变得很黑暗 哥们
my thoughts have been getting pretty dark, man.

503
00:39:00,234 --> 00:39:02,653
我是科学家 应该知道这样不对 但是...
I mean, I'm a scientist, I should know better but...

504
00:39:04,947 --> 00:39:06,991
你觉得人们生病的时候会知道吗
do you think people know when they're sick?

505
00:39:07,366 --> 00:39:09,326
就 内心深处
You know, like, deep down?

506
00:39:09,535 --> 00:39:10,578
在某种程度上
On some level?

507
00:39:10,578 --> 00:39:12,788
不知道 也许是身体的某种行为
I don't know, maybe it's something the body does.

508
00:39:14,957 --> 00:39:19,420
让你做好准备 这样 等医生走进来说
Kind of prepares you, so when the doctor walks in and he says,

509
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:23,424
"知道吗 一切都结束了" 你不会完全惊慌失措
"You know, it's all over," you don't totally freak out.

510
00:39:26,343 --> 00:39:27,511
因为某种程度上
Because on some level,

511
00:39:30,472 --> 00:39:32,057
你内心已经知道了真相
you already know the truth.

512
00:39:37,396 --> 00:39:38,939
我不知道该相信什么
I don't know what to believe.

513
00:39:40,858 --> 00:39:45,487
我最大的儿子 他 他想开始打篮球
My oldest, he, um, he wants to start basketball.

514
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,699
我整个高中都在打篮球
I played all throughout high school.

515
00:39:51,702 --> 00:39:53,537
我爸从没错过一场比赛
My dad never missed a game.

516
00:39:58,292 --> 00:40:00,044
我就不该让你闻的
I never should've made you smell it.

517
00:40:03,672 --> 00:40:04,673
你又没有逼我
You didn't make me.

518
00:40:04,673 --> 00:40:06,342
本 如果发生了什么...
Ben, if anything happens...

519
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:11,931
我非常抱歉
I'm so sorry.

520
00:40:14,516 --> 00:40:15,309
我知道
I know.

521
00:40:25,819 --> 00:40:28,280
还有没有其他血样像这个一样 看起来像浓汤
Any of the other have been all soup, like this guy?

522
00:40:29,031 --> 00:40:32,284
我没看到过 更像是糊不是汤
Not that I've seen. More mush than soup.

523
00:40:33,577 --> 00:40:34,870
这是哪个房间的
What cell is it from?

524
00:40:36,956 --> 00:40:39,291
K室 怎么了
Cell K. Why?

525
00:40:43,712 --> 00:40:45,756
把这些样本打包 然后继续
Bag those samples and move on.

526
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:47,716
你要走了吗
You're leaving?

527
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:49,468
我得去检查一个东西
I got to check something.

528
00:40:50,094 --> 00:40:51,595
接手吧 你会没事的
Take over, you'll be fine.

529
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:03,399
好了 这是你的第三块电池 长官
Okay. That's your third battery, sir.

530
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:10,990
长官 我们已经行动了12个小时
Sir, we've been going at this for 12 hours.

531
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:13,534
其他人每45分钟就会休息...
Rest of us have been breaking every 45 minutes...

532
00:41:13,784 --> 00:41:15,119
你也需要休息一下
You need one, too.

533
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,038
我越早弄完
The faster I get through these

534
00:41:18,038 --> 00:41:19,873
我们需要处理的感染动物就越少
the fewer infected animals we're handling.

535
00:41:22,376 --> 00:41:24,503
但你说得对 我们在这儿待得太久了
But you're right. We have been in here too long.

536
00:41:25,337 --> 00:41:28,424
让大家出去吃点东西 把这衣服脱了
Have everybody get some food. Get them out of their suits.

537
00:41:28,716 --> 00:41:32,011
是 长官 但如果你要留下 我也留下
Yes, sir, but if you're staying, I'm staying.

538
00:41:32,011 --> 00:41:33,429
我不会让你独自留下来
I'm not leaving you here alone.

539
00:41:33,637 --> 00:41:35,597
91探戈队注意了...
Attention 91-Tangos...

540
00:42:30,903 --> 00:42:32,279
告诉你阿姨
Well, just tell your aunt to put the

541
00:42:32,279 --> 00:42:35,908
把烤箱调到275度 直到芝士冒泡...
oven at 275 un-until the cheese bubbles over...

542
00:42:36,658 --> 00:42:38,869
我知道 所以才给你们做了
I know, that's why I made it for you.

543
00:42:38,869 --> 00:42:43,373
还有 转告你哥哥 记得练钢琴 我爱他...
Oh, and tell your brother, um, to practice the piano and that I love him...

544
00:42:44,583 --> 00:42:47,461
我也爱你 好了 亲爱的 拜拜
