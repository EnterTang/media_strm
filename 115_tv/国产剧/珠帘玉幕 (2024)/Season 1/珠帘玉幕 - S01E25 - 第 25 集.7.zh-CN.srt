00:07:02,967 --> 00:07:06,768
Are you still upset
about... things?

170
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:11,406
Yes, I am still upset
about things.

171
00:07:11,408 --> 00:07:13,742
Well, I brought you
something

172
00:07:13,744 --> 00:07:15,978
that might take
your mind off it.

173
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,280
My fist!
Ha-ha!

Ha!

179
00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:35,831
I see your skills
have progressed far

180
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:38,367
since I first
introduced you to kung fu.

181
00:07:38,369 --> 00:07:40,002
One thing though.

182
00:07:40,004 --> 00:07:43,639
You never did
understand strategy.

183
00:07:43,641 --> 00:07:45,274
- [Metal clangs]
- Ow!

184
00:07:45,276 --> 00:07:47,009
Isn't it marvelous,
my boy?

185
00:07:47,011 --> 00:07:48,844
Just like old times.

186
00:07:48,846 --> 00:07:50,345
If this were like old times,

187
00:07:50,347 --> 00:07:53,649
you would have
stolen something by now, and...

188
00:07:53,651 --> 00:07:55,450
[Sighs]
Put it back.

189
00:07:55,452 --> 00:07:56,451
Put what?
Wh...

190
00:07:56,453 --> 00:08:01,190
Put it back.

191
00:08:01,192 --> 00:08:03,825
I suppose it's best that
you all find out at once.

192
00:08:03,827 --> 00:08:05,794
This is my father Shirong.

193
00:08:05,796 --> 00:08:09,431
He is a thief,
a con man, and leaving.

194
00:08:09,433 --> 00:08:10,832
Out.

195
00:08:10,834 --> 00:08:14,169
You send me out there
and I won't last a day.

196
00:08:14,171 --> 00:08:16,605
The crocs were telling
the truth, weren't they?

197
00:08:16,607 --> 00:08:18,574
You stole from Tong Fo.

198
00:08:18,576 --> 00:08:19,975
No, indeed.

199
00:08:19,977 --> 00:08:22,477
I merely sold him
a priceless jade statue

200
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,115
that didn't actually happen to,
as it were, exist.

201
00:08:27,117 --> 00:08:30,652
I admit the distinction
is purely infantisular, but...

202
00:08:30,654 --> 00:08:31,920
Don't do that!

- What?
- Make up words.

Infertisular, vortisrompunate,

205

Do you have any idea how
confused I was as a child?

206
00:08:41,198 --> 00:08:44,733
I assure you, my motives
were entirely oprivastrian.

207
00:08:44,735 --> 00:08:46,001
Get out!

208
00:08:46,003 --> 00:08:47,869
But Shifu,
if you throw him out,

209
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,505
Tong Fo will hurt him
till he quits breathing.

210
00:08:50,507 --> 00:08:51,673
And you know...

211
00:08:51,675 --> 00:08:54,910
He is your dad.

One night, that's all.

214
00:09:04,888 --> 00:09:06,855
How can I thank you, son?

215
00:09:06,857 --> 00:09:08,957
By leaving as soon
as possible.

216
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,927
I suggest you all
lock up your valuables.

217
00:09:16,332 --> 00:09:18,000
Are you really a con man?

218
00:09:18,002 --> 00:09:22,304
Yes, and I don't deserve
a son as fantabulous as Shifu.

219
00:09:22,306 --> 00:09:23,972
Yeah, I was just
saying that.

He sure is
fantaspa... namalama.

That's a good thing, right?

222
00:09:29,013 --> 00:09:32,447
Po, I want you to know
I appreciate you saving me

223
00:09:32,449 --> 00:09:34,416
from those crocs back there.

You're a good boy.

00:09:35,753 --> 00:09:37,386
Thanks.

226
00:09:37,388 --> 00:09:39,921
Anyway, you can stay in here.

In the storage room.

Cozy.

Yeah, um, I'll get you
a blanket and stuff.

Shirong!

235
00:10:06,382 --> 00:10:07,516
It must have been
Croc bandits.

236
00:10:07,518 --> 00:10:08,717
They guessed we'd
bring Shirong here

237
00:10:08,719 --> 00:10:10,952
and the moment we
left him alone, bam!

238
00:10:10,954 --> 00:10:13,922
They'll take him to Tong Fo's
lair at Camelback Mountain.

239
00:10:13,924 --> 00:10:15,791
If we hurry, we can save him.

240
00:10:15,793 --> 00:10:17,959
No.

241
00:10:17,961 --> 00:10:21,229
Po, did you actually
see any Croc bandits?

242
00:10:21,231 --> 00:10:24,199
No, but I heard Shirong
yelling and crashes and stuff.

243
00:10:24,201 --> 00:10:25,567
There's no proof
he was kidnapped.

244
00:10:25,569 --> 00:10:27,903
He could have
done this all himself.

245
00:10:27,905 --> 00:10:29,504
Why would he do that?

246
00:10:29,506 --> 00:10:31,039
Some sort of con.

247
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,374
As always.

00:10:32,376 --> 00:10:34,843
Undoubtedly something
valuable is missing.

- No.

guilty about it then?

Look, I found this.
It's solid gold.

If he was faking,
I don't think

00:11:14,151 --> 00:11:15,717
he would have
left that behind.

Trust me,
this is a scam.

I mean, he's your dad.

265
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,060
We should go after him.

we're not going after him.

From when I was
three years old,

270
00:11:35,305 --> 00:11:38,106
my father and I traveled to
different villages together

271
00:11:38,108 --> 00:11:40,409
selling ancient
magical talismans

272
00:11:40,411 --> 00:11:44,179
that were supposed
to cure the sick.

273
00:11:44,181 --> 00:11:45,747
Wow, where can I
get one of those...

274
00:11:45,749 --> 00:11:47,816
They were fake, Po.

275
00:11:47,818 --> 00:11:49,818
Every night I'd stay up late

276
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,820
carving talismans

277
00:11:51,822 --> 00:11:53,321
and painting them to look old.

278
00:11:53,323 --> 00:11:55,290
Sometimes we would
get out of a village

279
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:58,093
before people noticed
the talismans were fake.

280
00:11:58,095 --> 00:12:00,962
When I was 12,
my father sat me down

281
00:12:00,964 --> 00:12:02,898
in front of the jade palace
and told me

282
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,834
he'd be back in five minutes.

[Door creaks open]

Did he come back?

Oh, he did come back.

286
00:12:20,684 --> 00:12:22,451
About ten years later.

for food and supplies.

- Uh, that's wood.
- Exactly.

289
00:12:28,859 --> 00:12:32,060
Whenever my father shows up,
it's always a trick.

290
00:12:32,062 --> 00:12:34,996
Well he's not going to make
a sucker out of me this time.

291
00:12:39,302 --> 00:12:41,203
Think about it.

292
00:12:41,205 --> 00:12:43,038
Your dad can steal anywhere.

293
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,606
He wouldn't come
all the way here

294
00:12:44,608 --> 00:12:49,144
unless he wanted to see you.

295

I assure you,
this is nothing

but an unfortunate
misunderstanding.

302
00:13:21,178 --> 00:13:23,678
Maybe, but Tong Fo
wants to, like,

misunderstand you in person.

Gah, he always does this.

So nice of you
to drop in and whatnot.

308
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:45,267
I hate it when he does this.

It's all creepy and scary.

Yes, Po was an easy mark.

Once we capture him,

more than the money you owe me.
