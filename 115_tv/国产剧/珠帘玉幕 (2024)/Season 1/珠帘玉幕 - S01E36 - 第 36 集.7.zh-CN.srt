2
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,024
这首真的算是家喻户晓
is the one that really circulated in a large way.

3
00:36:03,024 --> 00:36:04,096
轰动了全国  是吧?
It was a national hit, then?

4
00:36:04,096 --> 00:36:08,076
确实轰动了全国  可以这么说
It was a national hit, that's a good way to put it.

5
00:36:08,076 --> 00:36:11,032
对该案子的好奇
It's really the interest in the case,

6
00:36:11,032 --> 00:36:14,088
以及在那个时候  十九世纪二十年代
plus the fact that there was at that time, the 1820s,

7
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:17,048
有一股歌唱狂潮
a strong popular singing tradition -

8
00:36:17,048 --> 00:36:20,096
人们就爱唱歌  为休闲  为娱乐
people singing for themselves, for recreation, for fun -

9
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:24,036
然后  确实引起了轰动  好了  我们试着唱一下吧
that meant things like this were a hit. Well, let's have a sing.

10
00:36:24,036 --> 00:36:25,096
好的  预备
Yes, let's.

11
00:36:25,096 --> 00:36:29,084
# 来吧  冲动无知的年轻人 #
# Come, all you thoughtless young men #

12
00:36:29,084 --> 00:36:33,008
# 听听我的忠告 #
# A warning take by me #

13
00:36:33,008 --> 00:36:38,096
# 想想我将被吊死在树上的不幸 #
# And think upon my unhappy fate to be hanged upon the tree #

14
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:43,064
# 我叫威廉・科德 #
# My name is William Corder #

15
00:36:43,064 --> 00:36:46,088
# 我承认犯了罪 #
# To you I do declare #

16
00:36:46,088 --> 00:36:50,060
# 我杀了玛利亚・马滕 #
# I courted Maria Marten #

17
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:54,052
# 美丽可爱的姑娘 #
# Most beautiful and fair. #

18
00:36:54,052 --> 00:36:57,052
假如1928年我在伦敦做服务员
Supposing I was a servant in London in 1928

19
00:36:57,052 --> 00:37:00,016
如果我想学这首歌的话  我该怎么做
and I wanted to learn this song, how would I go about doing it?

20
00:37:00,016 --> 00:37:02,052
很可能你会从街边民谣歌手
The most likely way you would learn it

21
00:37:02,052 --> 00:37:04,052
口中知道这首歌
is from a street ballad singer.

22
00:37:04,052 --> 00:37:06,048
当时有很多这样的歌手
There were hundreds of these people,

23
00:37:06,048 --> 00:37:08,064
甚至19世纪中期还有很多
even in the mid-19th century in London.

24
00:37:09,084 --> 00:37:11,064
他们不仅仅是卖艺的
They're not just buskers,

25
00:37:11,064 --> 00:37:16,008
他们在唱的同时  还卖这些曲子
because they would both sing and sell the ballad at the same time,

26
00:37:16,008 --> 00:37:19,008
这样的话  你就会学会这些调子
and that's the way you would learn the tune.

27
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:23,040
有很多人都围在他们身边
We have accounts of large crowds of people standing

28
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,032
听这些歌
listening to ballad singers.

29
00:37:25,032 --> 00:37:26,052
这样确实不错
It's a really good idea,

30
00:37:26,052 --> 00:37:29,036
因为如果每个伦敦市民都唱的话
because if everybody across Britain is singing this,

31
00:37:29,036 --> 00:37:31,492
就像是一个严重警告  是不是
it's like a massive public safety warning, isn't it,

32
00:37:31,493 --> 00:37:35,056
告诉人们  不要杀人灭口  埋在谷仓
saying "Don't go murdering ladies and burying them in barns.

33
00:37:35,056 --> 00:37:37,084
对你没有好处的  你会被处死
"It will be bad for you. You will die".

34
00:37:37,084 --> 00:37:40,024
是啊  可以这么说
Yes! You can look at it that way,

35
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:43,064
或者  可以这样认为  当时的报纸
or you can look at it on the way that the popular press

36
00:37:43,064 --> 00:37:48,048
既感到高兴  又不愿对这种
both delights in and takes a sort of distanced view

37
00:37:48,048 --> 00:37:50,080
血淋淋的事情进行过多报道
of gory happenings and so on.

38
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:54,028
所以既有振奋人心的部分  又是一种警告
There's both the fascination and the warning element in there.

39
00:37:54,028 --> 00:37:55,084
两种态度都很强烈
They're both quite strong.

40
00:37:55,084 --> 00:37:58,024
但是歌曲所表达的  就是  不要杀人  对吧
The lesson of the song is, though, don't do it, isn't it?

41
00:37:58,024 --> 00:38:01,028
尽管是一种愉悦感
Although they are taking a bit of pleasure

42
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:02,076
对那具血肉模糊的尸体
in the "bleeding, mangled body".

43
00:38:02,076 --> 00:38:05,056
我们再唱一下"血肉模糊"吧?  好  我还挺喜欢那首的
Shall we try the "bleeding, mangled" verse? Yeah, I like that one.

44
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:10,004
#毫无顾忌  以为不会有危险#
# With heart so light she thought no harm #

45
00:38:10,004 --> 00:38:13,032
#于是她就去见了他#
# To meet him she did go #

46
00:38:13,032 --> 00:38:20,052
#在谷仓杀了她  看着她倒下#
# He murdered her all in the barn and laid her body low #

47
00:38:20,052 --> 00:38:23,064
#腥风血雨之后#
# And after the horrible deed was done #

48
00:38:23,064 --> 00:38:27,068
#她直直地躺在了血泊中#
# She lay weltering in her gore #

49
00:38:27,068 --> 00:38:31,032
#他把她血肉模糊的尸体埋在了#
# Her bleeding, mangled body he buried #

50
00:38:31,032 --> 00:38:34,080
#谷仓红色的地板下# 
# Beneath the red barn floor. #

51
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:37,028
真是一种荒唐的恐怖
That's ridiculously ghoulish!

52
00:38:37,028 --> 00:38:40,032
血淋淋的  尸体  扭曲  恶
The blood, the body, the mangling, ugh!

53
00:38:40,032 --> 00:38:43,048
毕竟杀人不是一件光彩的事  细节部分让人欲罢不能
Murder is not a nice thing, and this is relishing in that detail.

54
00:38:43,048 --> 00:38:44,092
为天使之声干杯
The voice of an angel.

56
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:02,012
情节剧  抨击和民谣
Melodramas and broadsides and ballads

57
00:39:02,012 --> 00:39:04,056
让波尔斯特德臭名昭著
had made Polstead infamous.

58
00:39:04,056 --> 00:39:08,040
游客专为谋杀案而来  迫切想要参观这个村子
Murder tourists arrived, wanting to visit the village

59
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:12,052
来看看红谷仓  甚至想摸一下玛利亚的坟墓
to see the red barn, and even to touch the grave of poor Maria.

60
00:39:14,036 --> 00:39:19,068
这块板子上写着  玛利亚・马滕就葬在附近
This board here tells us that Maria Marten is buried nearby.

61
00:39:19,068 --> 00:39:23,004
她那时才年满25岁
She was aged just 25 years.

62
00:39:23,004 --> 00:39:25,012
我们没法见到她真正的墓碑
We can't see her actual gravestone

63
00:39:25,012 --> 00:39:28,020
早就被人切成一片一片  做成纪念品了
because it was chipped to pieces by souvenir hunters,

64
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,016
现在连渣都找不到
and there isn't a trace of it left.

65
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:36,036
在犯罪故事中
As in many a crime story,

66
00:39:36,036 --> 00:39:39,068
我们对红谷仓谋杀案中最感兴趣的是
the murder in the red barn shows that we are more interested

67
00:39:39,068 --> 00:39:42,028
凶手的性格和品行
in the character and the deeds of the murderer

68
00:39:42,028 --> 00:39:43,076
而不是受害者
than those of the victim.

69
00:39:45,024 --> 00:39:48,056
威廉・科德谋杀案发生后  兴起了一个
William Corder's crime created a weird industry

70
00:39:48,056 --> 00:39:52,000
叫凶杀案纪念品的新兴产业
in what we might call murder souvenirs.

71
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,056
只要有钱
Anyone who had the cash

72
00:39:53,056 --> 00:39:57,032
就可以买到红谷仓的陶瓷制品
could buy one of these ceramic models of the red barn,

73
00:39:57,032 --> 00:40:00,028
拿回家  放在壁炉台
take it home and have it on your own mantelpiece.

74
00:40:00,028 --> 00:40:02,000
更离谱的是
Slightly more exclusive

75
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,024
还有用红谷仓大梁木制成的小工艺品
were knick-knacks made out of the timbers of the red barn itself.

76
00:40:06,024 --> 00:40:10,020
这是一个鞋状的鼻烟盒
This is a little snuffbox in the shape of a shoe.

77
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:14,092
和谋杀关系越近的纪念品  价格就越高  
The items associated with the crime were more valuable.

78
00:40:14,092 --> 00:40:19,060
这是真的手枪  他当时作案的工具
These were the actual pistols. These are what he used to shoot her.

79
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:23,028
恐怖性已经上升到了一个层次
Ascending up the scale of gruesomeness,

80
00:40:23,028 --> 00:40:25,044
这本书写的是威廉・科德
this is a book about William Corder,

81
00:40:25,044 --> 00:40:27,088
是由泰晤士报的记者写的
written by a journalist from The Times.

82
00:40:27,088 --> 00:40:31,084
别以为这只是普通的一本书  打开封面
You'd think it was just a book, until you open up the cover

83
00:40:31,084 --> 00:40:35,072
就会发现  皮质的封面
and you read that the leather binding is made

84
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:38,036
是用凶手的皮肤制成的
from the skin of the murderer,

85
00:40:38,036 --> 00:40:42,000
一名萨福克的外科医生
taken from his body and tanned by a surgeon

86
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,044
从他尸体上取下晒干制成
from the Suffolk Hospital.

87
00:40:44,044 --> 00:40:49,004
最让你意想不到的  头皮发麻的
But top of the tree, absolutely most gruesome of all,

88
00:40:49,004 --> 00:40:52,088
是这个  威廉・科德的头的背部
this is the back of William Corder's head.

89
00:40:52,088 --> 00:40:55,044
这是他的头皮
It's the skin from his scalp.

90
00:40:55,044 --> 00:40:58,052
几根头发还在上面
You can see on it the little hairs,

91
00:40:58,052 --> 00:41:01,052
这里  是凶手的耳朵
and just over here is the murderer's ear.

92
00:41:03,032 --> 00:41:07,016
颅相学家对他的头很感兴趣
Phrenologists were also keen to study Corder's head,

93
00:41:07,016 --> 00:41:09,076
因为他们觉得上面坑坑洼洼的肿块
because they thought the lumps and bumps on it

94
00:41:09,076 --> 00:41:13,000
跟他行凶有一定的联系
represented the homicidal aspects of his personality.

95
00:41:14,048 --> 00:41:16,028
这是什么
What is this?

96
00:41:16,028 --> 00:41:21,056
这是威廉・科德的立体半身相
This is a full 3-D bust of William Corder, taken from death.

97
00:41:21,056 --> 00:41:23,088
看上去确实很阴森
It does bear some of the grim signs

98
00:41:23,088 --> 00:41:27,060
想到他被勒窒息而死
of his death by strangulation and asphyxiation.

99
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,080
你从前面看
If you look at the front

100
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:31,032
可以看到他嘴唇和鼻子是肿胀的
where you can see the lips and the nose are swollen,

101
00:41:31,032 --> 00:41:35,084
是因为当时血管爆裂
that is where all the blood vessels are bursting in his face.

102
00:41:35,084 --> 00:41:38,072
这里  可以看到死前的挣扎
Here, you can see someone struggling through death.

103
00:41:40,052 --> 00:41:43,088
那威廉・科德的尸体后来怎么处理的
Tell me what happened to William Corder's body afterwards.

104
00:41:43,088 --> 00:41:46,044
他吊在那里差不多有一个小时
He would have probably been left to hang for about an hour,

105
00:41:46,044 --> 00:41:48,096
只是为了确保他死了
just to make sure he was certainly dead.

106
00:41:48,096 --> 00:41:51,016
后来就把他尸体运到了前郡政厅
Then he would have been taken down to the Shire Hall,

107
00:41:51,016 --> 00:41:53,076
在那里  他被公开解剖
where basically, they would have publicly anatomised him.

108
00:41:53,076 --> 00:41:56,016
他的尸体竟然就这样
So I'm getting an impression of this dead body

109
00:41:56,016 --> 00:41:58,092
运到前郡政厅
being brought into the Shire Hall over there,

110
00:41:58,092 --> 00:42:04,068
大庭广众之下  一大群的人围着观察  是啊
and swarms of people coming to examine it, all in public? Yes.

111
00:42:04,068 --> 00:42:06,064
其实  他被绞刑的那天
Presumably, it would have been

112
00:42:06,064 --> 00:42:09,064
算是很隆重的一天
the same sort of grand day out as the execution.

113
00:42:09,064 --> 00:42:11,020
如果有人错过了
If you missed the execution,

114
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:13,084
就过来看他四分五裂的尸体
you could go along and watch the body being cut up.

115
00:42:13,084 --> 00:42:14,096
事实上
It was, in essence,

116
00:42:14,096 --> 00:42:19,028
这是跟著名暴徒近距离接触的大好机会
your chance to see a celebrity of the nefarious sort.

117
00:42:19,028 --> 00:42:21,040
可不可以说他促进了
Would you say that he has contributed

118
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,096
当地的旅游业?  完全正确
to the local tourist industry? Absolutely.

119
00:42:23,096 --> 00:42:27,044
由于之前他在这儿陈列了一百多年
Since he's been on display here for the last hundred years,

120
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,024
每个人来了都要问
people come in every day saying,

121
00:42:29,024 --> 00:42:31,060
“你有没有那本封面是皮肤的书”
"Have you still got the book bound in skin?

122
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:33,012
“你有没有把皮肤扯下来”  等等
"Have you got the bit of skin?" etc.

123
00:42:33,012 --> 00:42:34,040
实话说
And to be honest,

124
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,052
波尔斯特德的狂热者
the likes of the community of Polstead

125
00:42:36,052 --> 00:42:38,096
还庆祝威廉・科德被绞刑
still celebrate the story of William Corder

126
00:42:38,096 --> 00:42:40,084
还有红房子谋杀案
and the murder in the red barn.

127
00:42:40,084 --> 00:42:45,052
"庆祝当地的杀人犯"  听着还真搞笑
It's really funny to hear you saying "We celebrate our local murderer"!

128
00:42:45,052 --> 00:42:50,048
我觉得是因为这个故事经历了漫长的变迁
I think it's because the story has gone under so many transitions

129
00:42:50,048 --> 00:42:54,036
几乎变成了传说  像个故事一样
to become basically so fabricated that it is a story.

130
00:42:54,036 --> 00:42:57,016
我觉得我们庆祝的是一个故事
And I think we're celebrating the story,

131
00:42:57,016 --> 00:43:01,028
而不是罪行的恶劣
as opposed to the reality of the nastiness of the crime.

132
00:43:01,028 --> 00:43:05,028
而且这跟戏剧一样极具娱乐性
And it has all the bearings of a great, entertaining play.

133
00:43:07,072 --> 00:43:09,084
玛利亚・马滕的故事说明了
The tale of Maria Marten showed

134
00:43:09,084 --> 00:43:12,044
萨福克郡的谋杀
how a crime of passion in rural Suffolk

135
00:43:12,044 --> 00:43:15,084
变成了全国的娱乐的过程
could become a national source of entertainment.

136
00:43:15,084 --> 00:43:17,064
这使得威廉・科德
It elevated William Corder

137
00:43:17,064 --> 00:43:21,032
一举成为那个世纪最臭名昭著的凶手
into one of the most notorious murderers of the century.

138
00:43:21,032 --> 00:43:24,088
20年后  一个女杀人犯
20 years later, it would be a famous murderess

139
00:43:24,088 --> 00:43:28,020
同样吸引住了公众的眼球
who would similarly enthral the public.

140
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:31,076
这个美貌但冷血的女人
This attractive and apparently cold-hearted woman

141
00:43:31,076 --> 00:43:33,076
由于柏孟塞谋杀案
became infamous for her part

142
00:43:33,076 --> 00:43:36,084
而声名狼藉
in the crime known as the Bermondsey Horror.

143
00:43:39,068 --> 00:43:41,028
玛利亚・曼宁
Maria Manning was living

144
00:43:41,028 --> 00:43:44,096
住在伦敦南部柏孟塞米尼弗3号
at No.3, Miniver Place, Bermondsey, South London,

145
00:43:44,096 --> 00:43:46,084
他的丈夫叫弗雷德里克
with her husband, Frederick.

146
00:43:46,084 --> 00:43:49,016
故事发生在1849年
The year was 1849.

147
00:43:50,092 --> 00:43:52,084
弗雷德里克和玛利亚・曼宁
Frederick and Maria Manning

148
00:43:52,084 --> 00:43:55,092
是即将步入30的新婚夫妇
were a newly married couple in their late twenties.

149
00:43:55,092 --> 00:43:59,016
弗雷德里克是铁路护卫工
Frederick had been a guard on the railways,

150
00:43:59,016 --> 00:44:02,064
后来经商破了产
and then he had failed in business as a publican

151
00:44:02,064 --> 00:44:04,064
于是失业在家
and now he was unemployed.

152
00:44:04,064 --> 00:44:08,032
他的妻子玛利亚  极具异国情调
His wife, Maria, was much more exotic.

153
00:44:08,032 --> 00:44:11,016
她是瑞士人  花季青春当了一个女佣
She was Swiss, and she had lived the high life as a lady's maid.

154
00:44:11,016 --> 00:44:14,076
身在异国他乡  住在豪宅里
She had travelled abroad and stayed in stately homes.

155
00:44:14,076 --> 00:44:17,028
然而她后来也落难了
But she too had fallen on hard times.

156
00:44:17,028 --> 00:44:20,048
依靠做裁缝的微薄收入度日
Now she was making ends meet as a dressmaker.

157
00:44:20,048 --> 00:44:24,056
她还住在米尼弗的时候
A frequent visitor to the Mannings' house in Miniver Place

158
00:44:24,056 --> 00:44:28,004
帕特里克・奥科诺尔经常来看他  他在海关工作
was Patrick O'Connor. He worked for the Customs,

159
00:44:28,004 --> 00:44:30,084
据说他很富裕
and he was rumoured to be a very wealthy man.

160
00:44:32,008 --> 00:44:35,052
三个人的关系始终非常古怪
The three of them certainly had a curious relationship.

161
00:44:35,052 --> 00:44:39,072
事实上  这是个丑闻  相当于三角恋
In fact, it was scandalous. This was almost certainly a love triangle.

162
00:44:42,016 --> 00:44:45,080
8月9日  星期四那天  帕特里克・奥科诺尔跟朋友说
On Thursday, 9th August, Patrick O'Connor told friends

163
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:49,052
曼宁邀请他晚上去做客
that he had been invited to have dinner with the Mannings.

164
00:44:49,052 --> 00:44:52,076
那天之后  再也没有人见过他
This was the last time he was seen alive.

165
00:44:54,048 --> 00:44:59,012
也就是那天晚上  他被杀害了
Sometime during that evening, he was ruthlessly killed.

166
00:44:59,012 --> 00:45:02,068
玛利亚用他的钥匙进入了他的住处
Then, using his keys, Maria went to his lodgings

167
00:45:02,068 --> 00:45:07,072
偷走了他的财务  包括股票
and stole his valuables, including his stock and share certificates.

168
00:45:07,072 --> 00:45:09,008
四天后
Four days later,

169
00:45:09,008 --> 00:45:14,020
有人向伦敦警察厅报案说奥科诺尔失踪  
O'Connor was reported missing to a now centralised Metropolitan Police.

170
00:45:16,008 --> 00:45:18,068
8月17日  周五那天
On Friday the 17th of August,

171
00:45:18,068 --> 00:45:23,084
两名巡警进入了米尼弗3号
two police constables got access to 3 Miniver Place.

172
00:45:23,084 --> 00:45:26,056
他们是K队的巴尔内斯警员
They were PC Barnes of the K Division

173
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:30,032
M队的伯森警员  都来自伦敦警察厅
and PC Burson of the M Division, both for the Metropolitan Police.

174
00:45:30,032 --> 00:45:33,072
在房子里  他们发现一团糟
Inside the house, they found a state of confusion.

175
00:45:33,072 --> 00:45:36,052
所有的家具都不在了
Whatever furniture had been here had disappeared

176
00:45:36,052 --> 00:45:38,008
曼宁夫妇也不见了
and the Mannings were gone.

177
00:45:38,008 --> 00:45:41,072
巡警汇报说  巢还在
The constables reported back that the nest were still here

178
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:43,000
但是鸟已经飞了
but the birds had flown.

179
00:45:44,028 --> 00:45:47,044
然后他们就去搜厨房
Their search then took them into the back kitchen.

180
00:45:48,068 --> 00:45:51,044
两名巡警好眼力
The two police constables had eagle eyes.

181
00:45:51,044 --> 00:45:52,072
在厨房
In the kitchen,

182
00:45:52,072 --> 00:45:56,056
他们发现壁炉前地板上的石板是松的
they noticed that one of the flagstones was loose near the hearth.

183
00:45:56,056 --> 00:45:59,060
他们迅速挪开  发现了奥科诺尔
They soon had it up and there was O'Connor.

184
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:04,052
他全身赤裸地被捆绑着扔在石灰堆里  
He was naked, he's been trussed up, he'd been tossed in quicklime

185
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:06,068
全身发青
and his dead body was now blue.

186
00:46:08,064 --> 00:46:11,064
于是对逃犯的追捕开始了
The hunt for the murderers was now on,

187
00:46:11,064 --> 00:46:16,032
伦敦警察厅新成立的分局着手此案
led by the newly formed detective branch of the Metropolitan Police

188
00:46:16,032 --> 00:46:18,064
由查尔斯・菲尔德巡官负责
under inspector Charles Field.

189
00:46:18,064 --> 00:46:23,036
柏孟塞谋杀案是他们证明自己实力的一起案件
The Bermondsey horror was a chance for them to prove themselves.

190
00:46:23,036 --> 00:46:27,052
首先  他们得找到曼宁夫妇
First, Field's men had to track the Mannings down.

191
00:46:27,052 --> 00:46:28,072
但是  他们能去哪里了呢
But where were they?

192
00:46:28,072 --> 00:46:33,060
曼宁夫妇分开了  逃往两个不同的地方
The Mannings had split up and run in different directions.

193
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:36,004
玛利亚带着偷来的财产先走一步
It seems that Maria had gone off first without

194
00:46:36,004 --> 00:46:40,032
而对丈夫的去向一无所知
the knowledge of her husband, but with the couple's stolen wealth.

195
00:46:40,032 --> 00:46:43,044
曼宁夫妇抢了奥科诺尔的财产并且杀了他
The Mannings had robbed O'Connor and they'd killed him,

196
00:46:43,044 --> 00:46:46,072
最重要的是  玛利亚欺骗了他的丈夫
and on top of that, Maria had double-crossed her husband.

197
00:46:48,044 --> 00:46:50,032
玛利亚逃向了北部的苏格兰
Maria fled north to Scotland

198
00:46:50,032 --> 00:46:54,024
而倒霉的弗雷德里克上了一艘去海峡群岛的轮船
while the hapless Fredrick caught a steamer to the Channel Islands.

199
00:46:55,032 --> 00:46:58,072
为了了解侦探最终如何抓住曼宁夫妇
To discover more about how the detectives were able to trace

200
00:46:58,072 --> 00:47:02,088
我再次和罗莎琳德・克罗恩在伦敦南部相会
the Mannings, I met up again with Rosalind Crone in south London.

201
00:47:05,096 --> 00:47:08,096
1811年  拉特克利夫公里路谋杀案发生时
In 1811, when we have the Ratcliff Highway murders,

202
00:47:08,096 --> 00:47:11,048
官方相当不给力
there's a slightly chaotic response from the authorities

203
00:47:11,048 --> 00:47:14,076
但是曼宁夫妇谋杀案发生时  情况就不同了是吧?
but things are very different by the times of the Mannings, aren't they?

204
00:47:14,076 --> 00:47:18,008
是啊    后来是一个综合的巡查系统
Yes. What we see is a much more joined-up system of policing,

205
00:47:18,008 --> 00:47:21,044
更重要的是  由新的侦探队伍加入进来了
but more significantly they're joined by a new detective force.

206
00:47:21,044 --> 00:47:25,068
后来  1829年伦敦警察厅的成立是为了
Now, the Metropolitan Police force in 1829 are meant to be very much

207
00:47:25,068 --> 00:47:28,020
防止犯罪行为
a preventing crime force,

208
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:31,088

so they patrol beats and keep a watch over people and property.

209
00:47:31,088 --> 00:47:35,084
1842年成立的侦探小组  是为了侦查破案
The detective force, founded in 1842, is meant to detect crime.

210
00:47:35,084 --> 00:47:37,076
目的上有所不同
It's a slightly different function.

211
00:47:37,076 --> 00:47:39,080
但他们当时都是小型的
But they're only a small office at this stage -

212
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:43,048
在苏格兰场  大概只有8个人  
about eight man in total in their office in Scotland Yard.

213
00:47:43,048 --> 00:47:46,048
所以申请新的侦探小组  最后也通过了
So we've got this new detective squad and they're allowed, actually,

214
00:47:46,048 --> 00:47:48,064
第一次就去追捕罪犯
to go after the criminals for the first time.

215
00:47:48,064 --> 00:47:50,076
他们后来是怎么抓住玛利亚的呢?
How did they actually catch Maria?

216
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:54,024
首先  去房子里侦察的巡佐
First of all, the detective sergeant who's sent out to have a

217
00:47:54,024 --> 00:47:57,060
想办法找到了当时送玛利亚去车站
look at the house, is able to track down the cab driver who takes

218
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:59,012
的出租车司机
Maria to the station.
