I'll get this one for you, me hearty.

Ha! On guard.

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,260
These vines are perfect for swinging. You should try it, Tweak.

14
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,300
No thanks, Kwazii. I'm happy just pulling up carrots.

15
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,220
Oh, that's not very exciting.

16
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,980
There's got to be some action around here somewhere.

17
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,740
Captain, I think I'm going to take the GUP-B out for a spin

18
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,140
because...because I need to, erm...

19
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,220
Let me guess, practise your driving skills?

20
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,620
Ah, that's it! Practise my driving skills.

21
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,940
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

22
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,540

Ah! It's always nice to take the GUP-B out for a little excitement.

31
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,860
Looks like you brought back a friend.

- A baby dolphin.

35
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,140
He must have followed you inside, Kwazii.

36
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,260
Oh, he's just a baby.

37
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,100
Poor little matey. He needs his mother.

38
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,540
And we're going to find her. Tweak, sound the Octo alert.

Octonauts, to the launch bay.

41
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,260
Octonauts, our mission is to get this baby dolphin

42
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,660
- back to his mother.
- DOLPHIN SQUEAKS

43
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,700
I wonder how he lost his mummy.

44
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,020
I was driving the GUP-B near some dolphins. He must have started

45
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,380
following me instead of his mother.

46
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,580
- He must have got caught in your slipstream.
- What's a slipstream?

47
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,860
Dolphin mothers swim so fast that they make a path

48
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,020
in the water behind them called a slipstream.

49
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,940
The slipstream pulls the dolphin baby along

50
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,540
and helps it keep up.

51
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,860
But this baby dolphin must have got

52
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,460
carried away in the GUP-B slipstream.

53
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,460
Aw, I'm sorry, little matey.

54
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:51,460
It must have happened when I drove between you and your mum.

DOLPHIN SQUEAKS AND WHISTLES

56
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,580
I wonder why he keeps whistling like that?

57
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,700
Every dolphin makes a different sound that other dolphins know.

58
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,380
Dolphin mothers know their babies by their special sounds.

59
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:09,140
So, we can use this baby dolphin's sounds to help us find his mother.

60
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,620
Tweak, we'll need the microphone and recorder.

61
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,020
Got it, Cap.

62
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:18,380
First we'll record his sounds and then we'll play it while we search.

63
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:22,340
And his mummy will recognise the special sound.

64
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,340
Ready, set, whistle.

- Aye, Cap.

76
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,860
I'll... What? Did you say stay here and babysit?

77
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:02,420
- You're the best one for the job, Kwazii.
- Me? A babysitter?

78
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,820
Yes. The baby dolphin really seems to like you.

79
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,340
Keep a close eye on him.

Don't worry, little matey, they'll find your mother.

we saw some other dolphins back that way.
