1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,200
- SIREN WAILS
- 'Octonauts, to your stations!'

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,880
Barnacles!

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,320
Kwazii!

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,920
Peso!

5
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,560
- Explore!
- Rescue!
- Protect!

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,880
Octonauts!

7
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,720
Yaw!

8
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,800
Whoo-hoo!

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,520
Kwazii, have you collected those seaweed samples?

10
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,360
Aye, Captain. I'm heading back to the Octopod right...

11
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,120
- Shiver me whiskers! I thought
- I
- was a hotshot pilot

12
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,720
but these little fishes put me to shame! Octonauts!

13
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,560
'Can you see this?'

14
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,920
They're sardines, Kwazii.

15
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,760
They always travel together in a school.

16
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,360
But how do they all STAY together?

17
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,760
The scales on their skin help them feel when others are near them.

18
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,920
That's how they stay together when they move.

19
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,480
'A triple curlicue with a half-pike squiggle!'

20
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,120
I've got to try that. Kwazii out!

21
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,680
I'm going to show these fishes some moves of my own!

22
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,240
Ha-ha! Get a load of that!

23
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,760
A super-fast flip turn with a backwards loop! Not bad!

24
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,440
- Hey-hey! Top that!
- You're on!

25
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:05,320
BOTH: A backward rollover with a one-and-a-half inward split!

26
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,320
Ha-ha! You swim almost as well as a sardine!

27
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:13,200
- You're not too shabby for a little flipper-flapper!
- The name's Dina.

28
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,200
Kwazii. Maybe we'll have a rematch someday.

29
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,200
You're on! Better get back to my school before they...

30
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,240
Uh-oh.

31
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,400
Did you lose your school? I'll be glad to help you find them.

32
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,760
- No, thanks. I'm sure they didn't go too far. Bye, Kwazii.
- Bye, Dina.

33
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,400
Be careful, matey.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,400
Mm, lunch is served.

35
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,080
Ah!

36
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,560
Not so fast, ye scurvy shark!

37
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,040
Oh, no! Lunch is cancelled.

38
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,840
Oh, thanks, Kwazii! I guess it's not so safe out here without my school!

39
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,720
- They say there's safety in numbers.
- True.

40
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,000
That's why sardines travel in large schools.

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,080
Then, when a fish who wants to eat us shows up,

42
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,920
- we swim in different directions. It doesn't know who to follow!
- Clever!

43
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:16,800
- There's only one of me but I'll take you to your school.
- That's very nice!

44
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,440
Avast! There they are now!

45
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,080
I know a shortcut through this old shipwreck.

46
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,120
Ahh!

47
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,040
What happened?

48
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,000
- I'm caught in this old fish net.
- Are you hurt, Kwazii?

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,800
Nah. I just bumped my head.

50
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,320
Don't worry - I'll get myself out of this mess.

51
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,600
Yah! Stuck!

52
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,600
Maybe I could chew through the ropes.

53
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,680
No, Dina. You go on ahead, or you'll lose your school again!

54
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,240
Nope.

55
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,280
You didn't abandon me when I needed help.

56
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,600
I'm staying here with you till I know you're OK.

57
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,960
You're a brave lass, Dina, and a good friend.

58
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,160
I'd better call the Octopod.

59
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,960
What's wrong, Kwazii?

60
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,800
Well, I hit my head, the GUP is trapped,

61
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,680
and a little sardine is in danger cos she lost her school.

62
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,440
- Other than that, everything's fine.
- Hiya!
- Sounds like you need a hand.

63
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,320
- Dashi, sounds the Octoalert!
- Aye-aye.

64
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,000
ALARM WAILS

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,480
Octonauts, to the launch bay!

66
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,400
We've got an emergency rescue/ first aid/lost sardine situation.

67
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,760
ALL: Huh?!

68
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,440
Oh, I'll explain on the way. Tweak, into the GUP-D.

69
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,560
Peso, into the GUP-E.

70
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,920
- OK!
- Right-o, Captain!
- Dashi, open the Octohatch!

71
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,240
I'm on it, Captain!

72
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,080
Kwazii, your school is here.

73
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,400
Aye, you could call them that.

74
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,320
How's your head, Kwazii?

75
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,520
Do you feel dizzy? Sleepy?

76
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,200
How many fingers am I holding up?

77
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,640
- That's a trick question - you have none.
- Great.

78
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,760
You don't SEEM hurt. But I'll check you over as soon as I can.

79
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,240
That's where I come in!

80
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,120
Thanks, everybody.

81
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,640
Oh, where are my manners?

82
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,360
Octonauts, meet my new friend, Dina. Dina, Octonauts.

83
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,520
Hi, everybody. Sorry if I caused any trouble.

84
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,600
Nonsense!

85
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,360
The Octonauts are always happy to help.

86
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,440
Kwazii, which way did the school go?

87
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,640
They went that way, but they could be anywhere by now!

88
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,520
Barnacles to Shellington.

89
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,120
We've lost track of the sardines. Is there a way to find them?

90
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,360
Yes. We can find the sardines by listening for their burps.

91
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,360
Sardines burp?

92
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,520
Yes. Sardines - and many other fish - swallow air to help them float.

93
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,520
When they want to sink lower, the burp the air out again.

94
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,320
You can pick up the burping sound on the GUP's underwater microphone.

95
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,840
Now, just listen and be very quiet.

96
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,120
SNORING

97
00:06:54,760 --> 00:07:00,120
- I don't suppose the sardines are asleep.
- That's a seal snoring.

98
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,880
CLICKING

99
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,720
- What's that?
- A crab clicking its claws.

100
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,640
BURPING

101
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,160
Ah - burping!

102
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,040
- Dashi, can you tell us where it's coming from?
- I'm on it.

103
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,520
Straight ahead...near a coral reef.

104
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,560
That's where we're heading. Barnacles, out.

105
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,120
Dina, we may have found your school.

106
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,160
That's good news! Best be on your way, Dina.

107
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,800
But I don't want to leave you here.

108
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,080
I'll be fine - I'm with my school!

109
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,840
And you need to be with yours. Go on now.

110
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,080
Thanks, Kwazii, for all your help.

111
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,720
Any time. Stay safe out there!

112
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,640
Just follow me, Dina.

113
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,360
BURPING

114
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,560
The burping's getting louder. We must be close.

115
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,760
Don't tell me sea horses burp too, Shellington!

116
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:04,280
Lots of fish do, Captain. We must have picked up sea horse burps.

117
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,000
What if my school is so far away we never find them?

118
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,160
Captain, the burps you hear now are from above you.

119
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,440
This could be your school, Dina. Let's go.

120
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,000
BURPING

121
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,280
- We must be very close now.
- I can feel them with my scales!

122
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,400
There they are!

123
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,480
Whoops!

124
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,800
Almost forgot to say thank you!

125
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,000
- And please thank Kwazii for me.
- Don't mention it, Dina.

126
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,880
Helping sea creatures is what we do.

127
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,640
Bye, Dina!

128
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,360
I'll let Kwazii know you're all right.

129
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,440
There you go, Kwaz. You're free!

130
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,880
'Come in, Kwazii.'

131
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,160
We found Dina's school - she's safe and sound.

132
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,640
That's happy news indeed, Captain.

133
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,280
Everything looks good here. See you back at the Octopod.

134
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,000
Mmm. Breakfast, lunch AND dinner is served.

135
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,680
That shark looks hungry for sardines.

136
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,400
I've got to help them!

137
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,640
Oh, no!

138
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,120
Nah... Ah... Er...

139
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,880
Hmm.

140
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,560
They're swimming in different directions to confuse the shark.

141
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,800
Oh!

142
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,800
Uh-oh. More sharks. Looks like the sardines could use some backup.

143
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,360
Calling all GUPs. Sardines in trouble!

144
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,960
Yaw!

145
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,360
I don't know if I can hold them off by myself for much longer!

146
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,400
You won't need to, Captain!

147
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,360
YAW!

148
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:07,000
Octonauts, follow the sardines' lead. Swirl and confuse!

149
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:21,160
- Over here!
- This way!
- Catch me if you can!
- This way?

150
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,720
Ow!

151
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,880
Breakfast, lunch and dinner - cancelled!

152
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,120
THEY CHEER

153
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:35,680
- Kwazii! I'm so glad you're OK.
- And I'm glad YOU'RE OK.

154
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,920
I guess we both needed our schools to help us!

155
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,200
DINA BURPS

156
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,240
Excuse me!

157
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,680
THEY ALL LAUGH
