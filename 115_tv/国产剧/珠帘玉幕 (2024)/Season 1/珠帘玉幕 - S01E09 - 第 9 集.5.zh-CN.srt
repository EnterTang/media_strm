You know in the future,
when we're disembodied brains in jars,
或许将来 当我们变成被放在罐子里的

43
00:03:06,617 --> 00:03:09,321
we're going to look at this as eight hours well wasted.
回头看这八个小时 会是完全浪费

I'm with you.

a synthetic human I'd still be Jewish.
我只是想确保就算我成了人造人

48
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:26,814
I promised my mother.

I suppose you could have
your android penis circumcised.
我觉得你还可能得
给你的人工阴茎进行隔礼

50
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:37,875
But that's something your rabbi
would have to discuss with the manufacturer.
但那是你的犹太导师和制造商
应该探讨的问题

51
00:03:38,394 --> 00:03:41,173
Not to mention you'd have to
power down on saturdays.
而且你星期六还得进入节电模式

Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?
Sheldon 这封信为啥在垃圾箱里?

53
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:47,218
Well, there's always the possibility that

54
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:50,219
a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter
那封信周围自然形成了一个垃圾桶

55
00:03:50,902 --> 00:03:53,681
but Occam's rasor would suggest
that someone threw it out.
但据奥卡姆剃刀原理 应该是谁扔进去的吧
(原理核心 "如无必要 勿增实体")

56
00:03:54,762 --> 00:03:57,872
It's from the Institute of
Experimental Physics, they want us to
这是物理实验研究所寄来的
他们想让我们

57
00:03:57,931 --> 00:04:00,124
present our paper on the properties of supersolids
在玻色-爱因斯坦凝聚体主题会上

at the topical conference of Bose-Einstein condensates.
发表我们关于超立体特质的研究论文

00:04:03,233 --> 00:04:05,372
I know.
I read it before I threw it out.
我知道
我把它扔掉之前读过了

60
00:04:07,071 --> 00:04:09,299
Ok, if I may drill down to the bedrock of my question:
好吧 容我打破砂锅问到底

61
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:10,711
why did you throw it out?
你为什么把它扔掉?

62

in front of a group of judgmental strangers
面对一帮品头论足的陌生人
毫无兴趣

64
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:20,350
who wouldn't recognise true genius if
it was standing in front of them giving a speech.
就算一个真正的天才在面前讲演
他们也绝对察觉不到

65
00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:22,975
Which if I were there, would be.

I don't know Sheldon.

派对可是传奇性的啊!

68
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:33,058

还有其他我不知情的荣誉吗?

70
00:04:37,855 --> 00:04:40,669
Did the UPS dropped off a
Nobel prize with my name on it?
快递公司有没有送来一封
写着我名字的诺贝尔获奖信?

71
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,933
Leonard, please don't take this the wrong way,
but the day you win a Nobel prize,
Leonard 请别误会
但是什么时候你能得诺贝尔奖

72
00:04:44,053 --> 00:04:48,133
is the day I begin my research on the drag coefficient of tassles on flying carpets.
我就什么时候开始对
飞毯流苏的药物共作用性研究

73
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,987
the only thing missing from that insult was: "your mama".
这个羞辱只漏了一点 就是"你妈妈"

74
00:04:54,773 --> 00:04:55,766
I got one...
Hey Leonard,
我有个...
嗨 Leonard

75
00:04:55,886 --> 00:04:59,190
- Your mama's research methodology is so flawed...
- Shut up, Howard.
- 你妈妈的研究方法论也太次了...
- 闭嘴 Howard

76
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:02,812
- Sheldon, we have to do this.
- No, we don't.
- Sheldon 我们必须去

77
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:05,210
We have to take a nourishment, to expel waste,

and inhale enough oxygen to keep our cells from dying.

79
00:05:07,951 --> 00:05:09,376
Everything else is optional.
剩下的都是可选的

80
00:05:10,421 --> 00:05:12,449
Ok, let me put it this way:
I'm doing it.
好吧 我这么说吧
我要去

81
00:05:12,531 --> 00:05:14,779
You can't. I'm the lead author.
你不能 我才是主笔

82
00:05:14,971 --> 00:05:18,629
Come on, the only reason you're the lead author is because we went alphabetically.
得了吧 那是因为你姓氏字母靠前

83
00:05:18,653 --> 00:05:21,179
I let you think we went alphabetically to spare you
我让你以为我们是按字母排序
是为了减轻你的屈辱感

84
00:05:21,207 --> 00:05:23,601
the humiliation with dealing with the fact that it was my idea.
免于承受"那论文是我的构思"
这个残酷的现实

85
00:05:23,631 --> 00:05:26,728
Now to put too fine a point to it, but I was throwing you a bone.
坦率的说 我是在施恩于你

86
00:05:27,605 --> 00:05:28,605
You're welcome.

87
00:05:29,126 --> 00:05:32,579
Excuse me, I designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis.
拜托 是我设计了实验
证明了那些假设

88
00:05:32,702 --> 00:05:34,456
That doesn't mean proving.
那才不是证明

89
00:05:34,744 --> 00:05:38,129
So the entire scientific community is just supposed to take your word?
所以整个科学界都理应相信你的鬼话了?

90
00:05:38,184 --> 00:05:40,143
They're not supposed to, but they should.
不是理应 他们应该相信

91
00:05:41,226 --> 00:05:42,856
Alright, I don't care what you say.
好吧 我不管你怎么说

And I forbid it.
我不准

94
00:05:47,913 --> 00:05:49,146
You forbid it?
你不准?

If I'm not taking credit for our work then nobody is.
如果这荣誉不是归我名下
那就谁也别想得到

96
00:05:51,832 --> 00:05:54,066
- So, you admit that it's our work.
- No.
- 你承认这是我们共同的成果了
- 不是

97
00:05:54,134 --> 00:05:56,203
Once again, I'm throwing
you a bone.
再说一遍 是我施恩于你

98

And once again, you are welcome.

你现在和Sheldon怎么样?

Not only is he still not talking to me,
他不仅不和我说话

101

but there's this thing he does where he stares
at you and  tries to get your brain to explode.
他还总瞪着我
想要把我的头给看爆炸

How about this one?

It says, I know my physics, but I'm still a fun guy.
它就像在说 我虽然精通物理
但我仍是一个风趣的人

Oh, I didn't know they still made corduroy suits.
哦 我不知道还有人生产灯芯绒西服

没人生产了 所以我留着这件

Is this all stuff you want me to try on?

No, this is stuff I want you to throw out.
不 这些都是我想让你扔掉的

说真的 也别捐给慈善机构了
不会帮到任何人的

115
00:06:58,141 --> 00:06:59,690

That's the bottled city of Kandor.
这是瓶中城市Kandor

capital city of the planet Krypton.

and then rescued by Superman.
然后被超人所拯救

120
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,298
Oh, nice.
哦 厉害

121
00:07:18,463 --> 00:07:21,190
It's a lot cooler when girls aren't looking at it.
在没有女孩看的时候 它会更酷的

122
00:07:22,131 --> 00:07:25,356
Here, why don't you put these while I find
a shirt and a sport cut match.
你先把它换上
我找找相配的衬衫和外套

123
00:07:25,383 --> 00:07:26,397
Right, be right back.
好的 我马上回来

124
00:07:26,438 --> 00:07:28,179
Where are you going? Just put them on.
你去哪? 穿上就行了

125
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,193
Here?
在这儿?

126
00:07:29,261 --> 00:07:31,001
Oh, are you shy?
噢 你害羞了?

127
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,674
- No, I'm not shy.
- Don't worry I won't look.
- 不 我没害羞
- 别担心 我不会偷看的

128
00:07:33,838 --> 00:07:35,523
I know you won't look.
Why would you look?
我知道你不会偷看
你为啥要偷看呢?

129
00:07:35,572 --> 00:07:37,045
There's nothing to see...
Well, not 'nothing'...
又没什么好看的...
呃 也不是一点没有...

130
00:07:37,087 --> 00:07:39,538
Sweetie, put the pants on.
亲爱的 把裤子穿上

131
00:07:41,306 --> 00:07:43,992
So, you know, isn't there maybe
some way you and Sheldon could
会不会有一天你能和Sheldon

132
00:07:44,033 --> 00:07:47,473
- compromise on this whole presentation thing?
- No, No.
- 在出席会议那件事上彼此妥协呢?
- 不会的 不会的

133
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,295
Scientists do not compromise.
科学家不会妥协

134
00:07:49,323 --> 00:07:51,412
Our minds are trained to synthetize facts
我们的头脑是被训练来综合事实

135
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,337
and come to inarguable conclusions.
然后得出无可置疑的结论

136
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,503
Not to mention, Sheldon is back-crap crazy.
更何况 Sheldon是个驼背的疯子

137
00:07:59,614 --> 00:08:01,189
What is this?
这是什么?

138
00:08:01,326 --> 00:08:03,286
Oh, careful.
哦 小心点

139
00:08:03,738 --> 00:08:07,238
That's my original series Battlestar Galactica flight suit.
那是我收藏的太空堡垒卡拉狄加
原版系列宇航服

140
00:08:07,698 --> 00:08:09,932
Oh, why didn't you wear it on Halloween?
哦 怎么你都没有在万圣节穿过?

141
00:08:10,302 --> 00:08:12,303
Because it's not a costume, it's a flight suit.
因为它不是戏服 它是宇航服

142
00:08:15,619 --> 00:08:17,715
Ok, alright, moving on.
好吧 继续

143
00:08:17,811 --> 00:08:20,045
Oh, wow. A paisley shirt.
哇 涡旋纹花呢衫

144
00:08:20,086 --> 00:08:22,758
It goes with my corduroy suit.
那件是用来配我的灯芯绒西服

145
00:08:23,101 --> 00:08:26,006
if you mean it should end up in
the same place, then I agree.
如果你觉得它该和那西服同归于尽
我也同意

146
00:08:27,404 --> 00:08:29,555
Is this your only tie?
这是你唯一的一条领带?

147
00:08:30,596 --> 00:08:33,474
Technically, yes. But, if you'll notice...
理论上来说 是的
但是 如果你能注意到...

148
00:08:34,324 --> 00:08:36,174
It's reversible!
它是正反两面的!

149
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:40,024
So it works as two.
可以当两条用

150
00:08:40,093 --> 00:08:42,998
Sweetie, I don't even think it works as one.
亲爱的 我觉得当一条用它都够呛

151
00:08:44,804 --> 00:08:46,466
- Is this all your clothes?
- Eh, yeah.
- 这就是你全部的衣服了?
- 没错

152
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:48,383
Everything since the eighth grade.
八年级至今的全部衣服都在这儿了

153
00:08:48,506 --> 00:08:51,329
- The eighth grade?
- My last growth sprout
- 八年级?
- 我最后发育的年龄

154
00:08:53,453 --> 00:08:56,523
Ok, well, let's go back to the curdoroy suit.
好吧 还是选这套灯芯绒西服吧

155
00:08:56,564 --> 00:08:58,510
- Great.
- Yeah.
- 棒极了
- 是啊

156
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:02,028
I said no. Put it down.
我说了不 把它放下

157
00:09:07,937 --> 00:09:09,965
Hey Sheldon.
嗨 Sheldon

158
00:09:10,226 --> 00:09:11,486

161
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:23,326
Oh, you know, that is so weird
that yours came and mine didn't.
哦 那真是有点奇怪
你的到了可我那期还没来

162
00:09:29,109 --> 00:09:30,685
It was a joke.
我在开玩笑

163
00:09:34,946 --> 00:09:36,837
Yep.
是的

164
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:39,496
Tip you waitresses.
I'm here all week.
打赏你的服务员
我整星期都会在这里哦

165
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,647
Penny, just to save you from further awkwardness,
Penny 为了防止你进一步尴尬

166
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:46,169
know that I'm perfectly comfortable with
the two of us climbing the stairs in silence.
我并不介意
我们俩爬楼梯时保持沉默

167
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,951
Oh, yeah ok, me too. Zip it, lock it.

- So, you and Leonard...
- Oh dear God...

- 老天啊...

170
00:10:00,491 --> 00:10:02,091
Little misunderstanding, huh?
一点小误会啊?

171
00:10:02,618 --> 00:10:03,940
A little misunderstanding...?
一点小误会...?

172
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:07,305
Galileo and the Pope had a little misunderstanding.
伽利略和罗马教皇也有一点小误会
(伽利略因日心说被教皇迫害)

173
00:10:10,969 --> 00:10:14,794
Anyway, I was talking to Leonard this morning
and I think he feels really bad about it.
不管怎样 今天早上我跟Leonard谈过
我感觉他很难过

I don't understand the question.
我不明白你的问题

176
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:26,087
I'm just asking if it's difficult
to be fighting with your best friend.
我只想问
跟自己最好的朋友作对 会不会很难?

177
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:29,397
I haven't thought about it like that.
我没有这么想过

178
00:10:29,677 --> 00:10:32,567
I wonder if I've been experiencing physiological manifestations
我只是在想
这些无意识的情感波动

179
00:10:32,687 --> 00:10:35,230
of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil
会不会影响我的生理表现

180
00:10:36,626 --> 00:10:37,655
Wait, what?
等等 你说什么?

181
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,618
I couldn't poop this morning.
今天早上拉不出大便

182
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:47,079
You should just talk to him,
I'm sure you guys can work this out.
你得找他谈谈 我肯定你们俩能和好

You absolutely should talk to him.
你真该找他谈谈

186
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,018
Look, I know Leonard values you
as a friend and he told me himself
我知道Leonard当你是朋友
而且他自己说的 如果没有你的小点子

187
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:02,698
without your little idea there's no way
he could come up with this whole experiment thing.
他根本无法提出这个实验

188
00:11:07,032 --> 00:11:08,749
Excuse me. "Little idea"?

Yeah, I mean he tried to explain it to me,
是的 他试着跟我解释这个实验

190
00:11:10,881 --> 00:11:12,540
- I didn't really understand it but...
- Of course you didn't.
- 我实在不明白 但是...

He said: "Little idea"?

Oh, well, no...
Not...

- In what words then, exactly?
- 不是那个词
- 那他是怎么说的?

It's more the spirit in which he said...
你知道的....确切的词是...

- You had a lucky hunch
- 他说了什么?
- 你有个幸运驼背

196
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,931
Hey, Sheldon, I've been thinking, instead of arguing about this...
嘿 Sheldon 我在想 与其争论...

197
00:11:30,051 --> 00:11:32,028
Don't you ever speak to me again.

Ok, I'm leaving for the conference.

Have fun presenting my "lucky hunch"
但愿你能尽情陈述我的"幸运驼背"

201
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,254
Shel, I didn't mean it like that.
Shel 我并不是这意思

202
00:11:56,374 --> 00:11:58,040
- Then why did you say it?
- I don't know, I wasn't...
- 那你为什么这么说?
- 我不知道 我...

203
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,909
- Were you trying to impress Penny?
- No, no, not at all. A little bit.
- 你想逗Penny开心?
- 不 不 并不是 有一点

204
00:12:03,183 --> 00:12:04,956
How did that work out for you?
那样真的有用吗?

205
00:12:05,244 --> 00:12:08,764
- Leonard, ready to go?

- Leonard 准备好了吗?
- 性欲:1  真相:0

206

We did the work together,
let's present the paper together.
我们一起做的研究

208
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:17,479
And I'm telling you for the last time,
我最后回答你一次

209
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:20,429
it's pandering, it's undignifying, and bite me.
这是在拉皮条 这是无地自容
有种咬我

210
00:12:22,818 --> 00:12:23,823

213
00:12:42,282 --> 00:12:43,287
There you go.
可以了

214
00:12:43,586 --> 00:12:45,072
You're right this side does look better.
你说的对 这一面的确好看点

215
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:48,095
No, no, I didn't say better, I said "less stained".
不 我并没说更好看
我说"少点污渍"

216
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:53,084
I just checked the house.
There's probably 20-25 people in there.
我刚刚检查了下房间
里面大约有20-25个人

217
00:12:53,204 --> 00:12:54,700

- Is that all?
- 真的?!
- 就这么多?

218
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:58,229
"All?"
In particle physics 25 is Woodstock!
"就这么多?" 在量子物理学里
25人就是伍德斯托克音乐节

219
00:13:01,562 --> 00:13:03,609
- Then good!
- I wasn't expecting such a crowd,
- 那很好!

220
00:13:03,729 --> 00:13:04,731
I'm all nervous.
我好紧张

221
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:07,027
It's ok, just open with a joke,
you'll be fine.
没事的 开头讲个笑话 会顺利的

222
00:13:07,345 --> 00:13:09,246
A joke... Ok.
笑话...好吧

223
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,159
How about this? Um, ok...
这个怎么样? 呃 好吧...

224
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:13,725
There's this farmer
有个农夫

225
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:17,776
and he has these chickens but they won't lay any eggs, so...
他养了一群鸡却不会下蛋 于是...

226
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,897
he calls a physicist to help.
他找了个物理学家来帮忙

227
00:13:20,118 --> 00:13:22,840
The physicist then does some calculations,
物理学家做了些计算

228
00:13:23,092 --> 00:13:26,430
and he says: "I have a solution,
然后说 "我有个解决的办法"

229
00:13:26,797 --> 00:13:31,008
but it only works for spherical chickens in a vacuum".
"但只对在真空环境下的球形鸡适用"

230
00:13:33,569 --> 00:13:34,574
Right?
好笑吧?

231
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,509
Oh, sorry, I just had heard it before.
噢 对不起 我之前听过这个笑话

- Let's roll. Hey, nice suit.
- It's a classic, right?
- 我们进去 嘿 不错的西服
- 很经典 对吧?

233
00:13:46,746 --> 00:13:49,147
I really should have brought my own car.
我真该自己开车来

234
00:13:51,761 --> 00:13:53,351
So, in conclusion,
总而言之

235
00:13:53,471 --> 00:13:56,251
the data show that at temperatures approaching absolute zero,
数据显示 当温度接近绝对零度时

236
00:13:56,371 --> 00:13:59,870
the moment of inertia changes, and a solid becomes a supersolid,
惯性矩会改变 固体将变成超立体

237
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:04,011
which clearly appears to be a previously unknown state of matter.
也就是我们之前所未知的物态

238
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:08,003
Thank you!
谢谢!

239
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:15,216
- Are there any questions?
- Yeah.
- 有什么问题吗?
- 有

240
00:14:15,449 --> 00:14:17,210
What the hell was that?
那是什么鬼东西?

241
00:14:19,851 --> 00:14:20,941
Any other questions?
还有其他问题吗?

242
00:14:21,545 --> 00:14:26,097
Doctor Sheldon Cooper here, I am
the lead author of this particular paper.

244
00:14:30,832 --> 00:14:35,225
And you sir, you have completely skipped
over the part where I was walking through the park
而你 这位先生
你完全跳过了那段 -- 我穿过公园

245
00:14:35,488 --> 00:14:38,615
and I saw these children on a
merry-go-round which started me thinking
看到孩子们在旋转木马上

246

about the moment of inertia in gases like helium

an anecdote, it's not science.
我没有跳过 那只是个趣闻 并不是科学

249
00:14:46,632 --> 00:14:49,626
Oh, I see. It was
the apple falling on Newton's head,
噢 我知道了
那是掉在牛顿头上的苹果

- 那只是个趣闻吗?
- 你不是艾萨克・牛顿

251
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:55,751

would have been apparent to me without the apple.
不 不 这是真的
不用苹果 重力也能找到我

252
00:14:56,543 --> 00:14:58,241
You cannot possibly be that arrogant.

unlike you,

I don't need validation from lesser minds.

But it was straight downhill from there.

I've had enough of your condescendship.
我受够了你的鄙视

265
00:15:22,904 --> 00:15:25,875

when I was 11 like you.
也许我没有像你一样 11岁就上大学

266
00:15:25,888 --> 00:15:29,373
Maybe I got my doctorate at
24 instead of 16
也许我24岁才获得博士学位

274

Yes!
