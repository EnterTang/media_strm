Thundercats - S01E10
霹雳猫 第一季 第十集

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,500
视界之上

3
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,299
Now we're cooking.
我们快到了

4
00:00:26,367 --> 00:00:30,236
Book says the stone is dead ahead.
书上显示石头就在前方

5
00:00:30,304 --> 00:00:33,506
Then how about getting this
hunk of junk moving, Panthro?
不能让这个大家伙再开快点吗，猛猫？

6
00:00:33,574 --> 00:00:37,069
I'm not about to blow up the samoflange
again just as you got no patience
我可不想因为你的急性子再把车子搞坏

7
00:00:37,189 --> 00:00:39,435
Slow and steady wins the race, kid.
比赛中慢而稳才是最重要的

8
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,981
Race? Now that's an idea.
比赛？这是个好主意

9
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:45,283
You're on.
那就来吧

10
00:00:54,527 --> 00:00:56,995
You sure you want to
embarrass yourself, Tygra?
你确实要跟我比，虎猫？

11
00:00:57,063 --> 00:01:00,799
You've never beaten me
at anything in your life.
你还从没在任何方面赢过我呢

12
00:01:06,138 --> 00:01:08,306
On three then.
那就看着吧

13
00:01:14,613 --> 00:01:16,314
1...2...

14
00:01:16,382 --> 00:01:18,249
- Whoa
- Ho!
-哇哦
-呼！

15
00:01:18,317 --> 00:01:19,818
3.

16
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,091
They're beating us.
他们超过我们了

17
00:01:26,158 --> 00:01:29,427
They're not beating us
because we're not racing.
我们又有没在比赛

18
00:01:30,663 --> 00:01:33,031
What Panthro is trying to say, kids,
猛猫想说的是

19
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:35,100
is that he doesn't mind losing.
他不会在意<i>输掉</i>比赛

20
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,305
Hold on. It's about to get bumpy.
坐稳了，马上就会有些颠簸

21
00:01:42,742 --> 00:01:44,843
- Aah!
- Ow!

22
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:01,659
- Faster! Faster!
- Faster! Faster!
-再快点！再快点！

23
00:02:01,727 --> 00:02:04,863
It's looking like slow and steady
看起来慢而稳

24
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,198
doesn't win the race.
是赢不了这场比赛的

25
00:02:07,266 --> 00:02:08,900
Where are you going?
你要去哪?

26
00:02:08,968 --> 00:02:12,937
To give these boys
some <i>real</i> competition.
让那些小子们见识一下什么叫<i>真正</i>的比赛

27
00:02:21,313 --> 00:02:23,581
You want to see fast?
你想看看谁更快？

28
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:29,254
Got my baby hummin' now.
Listen to her purr.
该我的宝贝上场了
听听机器震颤吧

29
00:02:30,823 --> 00:02:32,323
Will this make us go faster?
按这个能让车跑得更快吗？

30
00:02:32,391 --> 00:02:34,559
Don't touch that! [beeps]
别按那个

31
00:02:38,631 --> 00:02:40,999
- Uh, she did it.
- Uh-uh-uh.
-是她干的
-呃

32
00:02:52,411 --> 00:02:54,078
Incoming!
导弹袭来了！

33
00:03:12,097 --> 00:03:14,399
That's cheating.
那不算数！

34
00:03:14,467 --> 00:03:18,269
Winner and still champion.
这次还是我赢了

35
00:03:26,946 --> 00:03:29,948
Check this out.
看看这个

36
00:03:53,038 --> 00:03:55,473
Everything's so big.
每样东西都好大

37
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,811
Including the residents.
这里的居民也是.

38
00:04:12,591 --> 00:04:14,058
Excuse me.
打扰一下

39
00:04:14,126 --> 00:04:15,860
Hello!
你好！

40
00:04:15,928 --> 00:04:17,362
- Hmm?
- Huh?
-嗯？

41
00:04:17,429 --> 00:04:18,863
- What?
- What is it?
-怎么了？
-谁来了？

42
00:04:18,931 --> 00:04:20,198
- Huh?
- What?

43
00:04:20,266 --> 00:04:22,200
Heh. Sorry.
呃，抱歉

44
00:04:22,268 --> 00:04:25,136
I am Lion-O, Lord of the Thundercats.
我是狮猫，霹雳猫的国王

45
00:04:25,204 --> 00:04:27,705
I am Aburn.

46
00:04:27,773 --> 00:04:30,041
And you are...?
请问你是...？

00:04:30,109 --> 00:04:33,211
Uh, name's Lion-O...

48
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:35,146
Lord of the Thundercats.
霹雳猫的国王

49
00:04:35,214 --> 00:04:38,149
Welcome, Lion-El.
欢迎你，湿猫

50
00:04:38,217 --> 00:04:39,651
Lion-O.
是狮猫

51
00:04:39,718 --> 00:04:41,586
How can we assist you?
有什么需要我们帮忙的吗？

52
00:04:41,654 --> 00:04:44,155
We're looking for a magical stone.
我们在寻找一块魔法石

53
00:04:44,223 --> 00:04:46,524
We believe it's
somewhere in your village.
我们觉得它应该就在你们的村庄里

54
00:04:46,592 --> 00:04:47,926
What is?
什么？

55
00:04:47,993 --> 00:04:49,794
Kind of forgetful, isn't he?
他好像有点健忘，不是吗？

56
00:04:49,862 --> 00:04:52,063
I think he's cute.
我觉得他蛮可爱的

57
00:04:52,131 --> 00:04:56,968
Listen, Aburn, we're searching
for a stone that looks like this.
是这样的，我们在寻找一块像这样的石头

58
00:04:57,036 --> 00:04:58,903
When did you lose it?
你们什么时候把它弄丢的？

59
00:04:58,971 --> 00:05:00,772
We didn't lose it.
我们没弄丢

60
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,407
So you have it?
那你们已经得到那块石头了？

61
00:05:02,474 --> 00:05:04,475
No, we're looking for it.
不，我们正在找它

62
00:05:04,543 --> 00:05:07,912
And what is it exactly
you are looking for?
那你们在找什么呢？

63
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:11,249
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
哦，他一定是在开玩笑吧

64
00:05:13,018 --> 00:05:17,522
I can't remember the last
time I saw a cat in these parts.
我都想不起来上次在这里看到猫是什么时候的事了

65
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:21,025
Yes, Anet. They
are looking for--
没错，Anet，他们在寻找--

66
00:05:21,093 --> 00:05:25,263
uh, what were you looking for, Lion-Lord?
呃，你们在找什么来着？

67
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:27,265
- The stone!
- The stone!
- The stone!
-魔法石！

68
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,934
If it is the spirit stone you seek,
如果你们要找的是精神之石

69
00:05:30,002 --> 00:05:32,537
then you've come to the right place.
那你们就来对地方了

70
00:05:32,605 --> 00:05:34,372
We have it here.
你要找的东西就在这里

71
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,209
Or we did...once...maybe.
可能...曾经...大概

72
00:05:38,277 --> 00:05:42,046
I'm afraid our memory is
not as great as our size.
恐怕我们的记忆不像我们的体形一样大

73
00:05:42,114 --> 00:05:46,517
But, please, feel free
to have a look around.
不过请随意在这里寻找吧

74
00:05:49,855 --> 00:05:53,224
No, no. Not with those eyes.
不，不是用肉眼去找

75
00:05:53,292 --> 00:05:55,293
With that one.
用那个

76
00:05:55,361 --> 00:05:58,730
Yes, I can sense its power.
没错，我能感觉到他的力量

77
00:05:58,797 --> 00:06:01,899
Come with me.
跟我来

78
00:06:13,312 --> 00:06:15,246
That's a lot of food, Aburn.
食物可真多啊，Aburn.

79
00:06:15,314 --> 00:06:19,817
It's the harvest, and we
must move it to safekeeping.
现在是丰收时节，我们得把食物妥善保护起来

80
00:06:19,885 --> 00:06:21,753
Safekeeping from what?
为了防止什么?

81
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,756
I...don't remember.
我...也不太清楚

82
00:06:24,823 --> 00:06:27,058
Of course you don't.
好吧，你果然不知道

83
00:06:32,131 --> 00:06:34,799
Like I told you,
I've already tried this.
我告诉过你，我已经这么试过了

84
00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:37,568
The sword only shows me
the stone, not where it is.
这把剑只显示出石头的影像，没有显示出它到底在哪

85
00:06:37,636 --> 00:06:40,872
Because you are not in
harmony with your sword.
那是因为你没有和剑融为一致

86
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:43,307
It is more than a tool, Lion-O.
剑不仅仅是一个工具，狮猫

87
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:46,310
It is a part of you.
它是你的一部分

88
00:06:46,378 --> 00:06:48,446
Try again.
再试试

89
00:06:48,514 --> 00:06:50,882
Sword of Omens...
神秘之剑...

90
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:53,718
Give me Sight Beyond Sight.
让我视他人之所不能

91
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:11,969
I can't concentrate with
all that noise. What is it?
那些噪音让我分神，到底是什么？

92
00:07:12,037 --> 00:07:16,007
The Wraiths! They come from
the hills for the harvest!
是猎食蜂，他们被丰收吸引来的

93
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,918
Whiskers.
麻烦了

94
00:08:05,557 --> 00:08:08,425
Why are they just sitting there?
他们怎么坐在那一动不动

95
00:08:08,493 --> 00:08:11,428
I think they're meditating.
我觉得他们在冥想

96
00:08:11,496 --> 00:08:14,498
Aren't you gonna do anything?
你不准备做点什么吗？

97
00:08:14,566 --> 00:08:16,000
But we are.
我们在做啊

98
00:08:16,067 --> 00:08:19,003
We are understanding.
我们在试着理解

99
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:22,740
Well, the Thundercats handle
things a little differently.
好吧，不过霹雳猫可不会这么处理问题

100
00:08:24,576 --> 00:08:27,411
Thundercats...ho!
霹雳猫 吼

101
00:08:33,084 --> 00:08:34,251
Hyah!
喝呀！

102
00:08:36,087 --> 00:08:37,254
Hyah!
喝呀！

103
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,471
Have them on the run now.
已经把他们赶跑了

104
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:58,709
Yeah, but they got what they came for.
不过他们已经拿到想要的东西了

105
00:09:00,545 --> 00:09:02,479
They wiped out your harvest.
他们抢走了你们收获的果实

106
00:09:02,547 --> 00:09:07,985
They took most of our
food, but not all of our food.
他们是拿走了很多，不过不是全部

107
00:09:08,053 --> 00:09:11,689
We still have enough to survive.
我们是还有足够的食物生活的

108
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:17,661
In order to get the
water it needs to thrive,
为了获得生长所需的水分

109
00:09:17,729 --> 00:09:20,497
this fruit suffers the storms.
这些果实经受了暴风雨

110
00:09:20,565 --> 00:09:24,468
We, too, must endure hardships to live.
我们也一样，生命中总是要忍受艰苦

111
00:09:24,536 --> 00:09:27,972
Such is the balance of the world.
这就是自然的平衡

112
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:32,142
Remember, work in harmony with your sword.
记住，和你的剑融为一体

113
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:35,479
Allow the bigger picture to emerge.
开阔你的内心

114
00:09:35,547 --> 00:09:38,082
Keep practicing.
继续练习

115
00:09:40,518 --> 00:09:44,755
If he's not gonna do something
about the Wraiths, then I will.
如果他不准备对付猎食蜂的话，我来

116
00:10:11,483 --> 00:10:13,117
Ooh.
哇

117
00:10:15,787 --> 00:10:17,621
Huh?
哈？

118
00:10:52,657 --> 00:10:54,725
That song you
are playing,
你们吹的曲子，

119
00:10:54,793 --> 00:10:57,194
it's very sad.
很悲伤

120
00:10:57,262 --> 00:10:58,529
It's a lullaby.
这是首摇篮曲

121
00:10:58,596 --> 00:11:00,831
Our mother used to hum it to us.
妈妈曾经给我们唱过

122
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:02,533
While you miss her greatly,
看来你们真的很想念母亲

123
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,070
know she always lives
on through your song.
要知道她一直活在你们的歌中

124
00:11:12,377 --> 00:11:16,113
Oh, but please, continue.
I didn't mean to interrupt.
哦，别停下，我不是有意要打断的

125
00:13:04,556 --> 00:13:06,423
What just happened?
发生了什么？

126
00:13:06,491 --> 00:13:09,860
It seems we achieved
perfect harmony--
好像我们达成了完美的和谐

127
00:13:09,928 --> 00:13:13,697
a beautiful and powerful thing.
优美而强大的曲子

128
00:13:13,765 --> 00:13:15,599
Wow.
哇哦

129
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:31,448
It's no wonder the elephants don't
do anything about these pests.
难怪那些大象不去对付这些蜂

130
00:13:31,516 --> 00:13:34,384
It's too hard to get here.
要爬到这里太难了

131
00:13:34,452 --> 00:13:36,386
Uh-oh. Here they come.
他们来了

132
00:13:49,968 --> 00:13:52,636
Aah!
啊!

133
00:14:35,957 --> 00:14:37,524
Uhh!
呃！

134
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:48,301
So that's where you're coming from.
原来这就是你们的老巢

135
00:14:55,143 --> 00:14:57,844
Mind if I close the front door?
不介意我把洞口堵上吧？

136
00:14:57,912 --> 00:14:59,579
Ho!
吼！

137
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,898
Aburn!

138
00:15:53,734 --> 00:15:56,837
Aren't you supposed to
be practicing with Anet?
你不是应该和Anet在练习吗？

139
00:15:56,904 --> 00:15:59,506
I thought I'd do you a favor instead.
我帮了你个忙

140
00:15:59,574 --> 00:16:01,107
I took care of your Wraiths.
我收拾了那群猎食蜂

141
00:16:01,175 --> 00:16:03,343
They won't be bothering you anymore.
它们不会再来打扰你了

142
00:16:03,411 --> 00:16:06,379
Oh, you shouldn't have done that.
哦，你不应该那么做的

143
00:16:06,447 --> 00:16:08,815
What? Why?
什么？为什么？

144
00:16:08,883 --> 00:16:11,785
I don't remember...
我想不起来了...

145
00:16:11,853 --> 00:16:14,020
But there's a good reason.
但一定有个理由的

146
00:16:14,088 --> 00:16:16,056
Because the harmony of the universe
因为自然的协调

147
00:16:16,123 --> 00:16:18,592
is now out of tune.
现在失衡了

148
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:23,196
You see, Lion-O,
正像你所说的，狮猫

149
00:16:23,264 --> 00:16:26,032
the Wraiths may have
taken some of our crops,
猎食蜂的确抢走了我们的粮食

150
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,902
but their loud sounds were all that kept
但他们的噪音

151
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,873
something far worse away from our village.
让村庄免遭更可怕的东西侵袭

152
00:16:47,488 --> 00:16:50,557
Without its natural
enemy patrolling the sky,
没有了它的天敌在天空中徘徊

153
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:54,394
this creature will do worse
than just eat our food.
那个生物会来村子里造成更大的毁坏

154
00:16:54,462 --> 00:16:56,496
I didn't know.
我并不知道...

155
00:16:56,564 --> 00:16:59,666
We elephants may not remember much,
我们大象没法记住很多东西

156
00:16:59,734 --> 00:17:04,004
but we never forget there is a
delicate balance to all things.
但我们知道世间万物都有微妙的平衡

157
00:17:04,071 --> 00:17:07,240
Come, let us meditate.
来吧，我们冥想

158
00:17:09,677 --> 00:17:12,279
Come on. We can't wait
for it to come to us.
我们可不能让那东西爬上来

159
00:17:12,346 --> 00:17:14,347
It'll destroy the entire village.
它会把整个村子都毁掉

160
00:17:21,889 --> 00:17:23,523
Where are you going?
你去哪？

161
00:17:23,591 --> 00:17:25,592
To meditate.
去冥想

162
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,275
Thundercats...ho!
霹雳猫 吼

163
00:17:55,222 --> 00:17:57,223
Hyah!
哈呀！

164
00:19:04,525 --> 00:19:06,459
What should we do?
我们该怎么办

165
00:19:06,527 --> 00:19:10,697
Simply let the answer come to you.
让答案来找你就行了

166
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,751
Lovely harmony, sis.
美妙的和谐

167
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,873
You see, Lion-O,
你明白了吗，狮猫

168
00:20:26,941 --> 00:20:29,709
when you fail to look
at the bigger picture,
当你没有纵观大局开阔思想

169
00:20:29,777 --> 00:20:34,047
it becomes impossible to know
the consequences of your actions.
你就不能知道你行为的后果

170
00:20:34,115 --> 00:20:37,817
I guess it's no wonder why I'm
struggling with Sight Beyond Sight.
我想我知道为什么我没法看到石头的所在了

171
00:20:37,885 --> 00:20:41,121
Let's try it one more time.
再试一次

172
00:20:45,126 --> 00:20:49,129
Sword of Omens, give
me Sight Beyond Sight.
神秘之剑，让我视他人所不能

173
00:21:02,076 --> 00:21:05,078
The hut. The stone is in the hut!
是小屋，石头在那间屋子里

174
00:21:27,368 --> 00:21:30,370
I don't understand.
我不明白

175
00:21:30,437 --> 00:21:33,940
Perhaps a different
approach is in order.
也许这是寻找石头必经之路

176
00:21:35,442 --> 00:21:38,211
Go to the forest of Magi Orr
去玛格奥尔森林

177
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:42,348
one of the most enchanted
places on all of Third Earth.
那是第三地球上魔法气息最浓郁的地方

178
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:46,052
There the power of the
sword will be amplified,
在哪里剑能力量会增强

179
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,388
and your connection with it.
你和剑的联系也会随之增强

180
00:21:48,455 --> 00:21:50,156
Where is this forest?
那个森林在哪里？

181
00:21:50,224 --> 00:21:52,392
Um, isn't it...?
呃，好像是...

182
00:21:52,459 --> 00:21:54,827
Um, uh...
嗯...呃...

183
00:21:54,895 --> 00:21:56,896
I was just there.
我才去过那里.

184
00:21:56,964 --> 00:21:58,665
Let me think.
让我想一想.

185
00:21:58,732 --> 00:22:01,067
Oh, brother. 
哦，伙计们.
