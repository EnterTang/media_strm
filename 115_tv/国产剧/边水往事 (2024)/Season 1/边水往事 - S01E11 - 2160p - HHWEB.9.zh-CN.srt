我们离门很近  冲过去吧
We are ten feet from the door. Just bust through.

4
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,670
我没法从各个角度保护你  你是目标
I can't cover you from every angle. You're the target.

5
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,100

8
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,450
他不怕子弹吧
He's bulletproof, ain't he?

9
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,390
她怕  先打她
She ain't. Shoot her first.

10
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,320
那拖不了他们太久
That's not gonna hold 'em long.

11
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,100
不
No.

12
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,970
他们堵住了门  没法进去
They barricaded the door and shit. There's no way through.

13
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,600
别管凯奇了
Forget Cage.

14
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,910
警察们过几分钟就会冲进来
The cops are gonna flood this place in a minute.

15
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,750
不  我们不走
No. We're staying.

16
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,990
谁都不许走  直到我们抓住他们
Nobody leaves. Not until we have them.

17
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,670
你在说什么  威利斯
What you talking about, Willis?

18
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,910
你现在还想开玩笑吗
You got jokes? Right now?

19
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,100
开玩笑的是你
You're the one who's joking

20
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,270
如果你觉得我们不用计划就能逃走
if you think that we're escaping here without a plan.

21
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,100
待会再讨论之前预想的计划吧
Later for that pre-written shit.

22
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,570
有时你得随心而为
Sometimes you gotta freestyle.

23
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,280
你只剩一枚犹大子弹了
Look, you got one Judas bullet left.

24
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,730
万一让卢克·凯奇抢占先机了呢
What are you gonna do if Luke Cage takes you head on?

25
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,180
我看上去像担心的样子吗
Do I look worried?

26
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,670
不  这才是问题所在
No. That's the problem.

27
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,380
这地方密不透风  连后门也封锁了
Place is airtight. Back is sealed off, too.

28
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,040
所以没有其他出路
So there's no other way out?

29
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,880
-是的  泰抓到了一名流浪者  -很好
- No. Ty caught a straggler. - Good.

30
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,060
只要不是我们的人  就是我们的人质
Anybody ain't us is a hostage.

31
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,510
确保谁都不能看到我
Make sure none of them look me in the eye.

32
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,640
洛佩斯  糖糖  你们看住
Lopes, Sugar, you're babysitting.

33
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,600
把他们转移到那边  面朝墙壁
Move 'em up there and face them towards the wall.

34
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,390
胆敢抵抗就蒙住他们的眼睛
Anybody resists, blindfold 'em.

35
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,200
胆敢多嘴就直接杀死
Too much lip, shoot 'em in the head.

36
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,840
剩下的人自然就懂了
The rest will get the message.

37
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,190
放开我
Let me go!

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,620
把减肥奥巴马带到楼上来  泰
Take Diet Obama upstairs, Ty.

39
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,200
在我上来之前  用枪指着他
Keep a gun on him till I get up there.

40
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,250
放开我
Take your hands off me!

41
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,500
-你们不能这样  -我们可以
- You can't do this! - Yes, we can.

你上去后  把我的钥匙给我
While you're up there, get me my key.

44
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,160
你知道我说的是哪一把
You know the one I'm talking about.

45
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,750
你叫我姓是想干什么
What the hell are you doing calling me out by my first name?

46
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,510
如果你觉得我们逃得掉  那简直是在做梦
You're dreaming if you think we're getting out of here.

47
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,310
你当着一百多人的面朝一名女警开枪
You shot a female cop in front of 100 people.

48
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,760

外面的人只知道卢克·凯奇疯了
All they know outside is that Cage lost his mind,

54
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,430
发生了交火  产生了僵局
shots were fired, and it's a standoff.

55
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,490
未知是我们的好伙伴
Confusion is our friend.

56
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,200
只要我们杀了卢克和米丝蒂
We kill Luke and Misty,

57
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:18,420
我们就会摇身变成阻止哈莱姆威胁的英雄
suddenly, we're the heroes who stopped the Harlem Menace.

58
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,230
他们只知道  是他杀了她
For all they know, he killed her.

59
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,830
只要他们死  随我们怎么说
With them dead, we control the story.

60
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,570
那就是你的计划  就这样
That's your plan? That's it?

61
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,630
我们拖得越久
The bigger the stall,

62
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,060
就有越多时间编造其他版本
the more time we have for other diversions.

63
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,240
米丝蒂一定要死  我会再给凯奇来一枪
Misty will be dead, I'll have another shot at Cage,

64
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,090
这里还会有别的出路
and there's bound to be another way out of here.

65
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,120
我们能尽快离开这里
We'll cross that bridge soon enough.

66
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,270
我们要怎么拖住他们
Okay. How do we hold them off right now?

67

-我觉得你伤到动脉了  -什么
- I think you nicked an artery. - What?

71
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:06,130
所以才失血这么快
That's why it's bleeding so fast.

72
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,740
我不骗你  米丝蒂
And I ain't gonna lie, Misty.

73
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,170
-你不会喜欢的  -什么意思

按住
Hold that.

75
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,980
我们应该从后面出去
We should just go out the back.

76
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,640
-他们已经派人看守了  -你怎么知道
- They've already secured it. - How do you know?

77
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,080
换我就会这么做  现在他想赢的唯一方式
It's what I would do. The only way he can win at this point

78
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,220
就是控制进出的所有人
is if he can control who comes in and who leaves.

79
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,450
不管怎么样  我要先带你去安全的地方
Either way, I gotta get you someplace safe.

80
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,280
怎么还是
What the hell?

81
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,300
还好这幢楼曾经是卢西亚诺的

这里还有很多暗道和角落

转过去  面朝墙壁
Turn around. Face the wall.

谁在帮我

00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,120
他不可能从后面跑了
No way he went out the back.

136
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,910
彻底搜查这里
Scour this whole place.

137
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:54,060
一处角落都不放过  即使是明显的地方
Every inch. Even if it's obvious.

138
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,300
我们这样太明目张胆了
We are making way too much noise.

139
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,090
他们随时可能冲进来
They're gonna bust in that door any minute.

140
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,400
事情变糟了
It's getting messy.

141
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:04,540
-你为什么这么担心  -因为我头脑清楚
- Why are you so shook? - 'Cause I'm clearheaded.

142
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,610
我头脑不清楚吗  我是闹得不小
And I'm not? Look, I'm spitting off the dome.

143
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,420
没错  但到目前为止我节奏很明确
It's true, but I haven't had a misplaced rhyme yet.

144
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,920
卢克·凯奇出现在
Violence breaks out

145
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,500
一个反对卢克·凯奇的集会上时  发生了暴乱
at an anti-Luke Cage rally when Luke Cage shows up?

146
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:17,600
这简直是千载难逢的机会
Come on, this shit is poetry.

147
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:21,000
-他值得我们这样吗  -当然
- Is he worth it? - Absolutely.

148
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,440
你跟玛莉娅谈过了吗
Did you talk to Mariah?

149
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,210
-她在着手准备了  -很好
- She's on it. - Good.

150
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,850
现在他们害怕凯奇  他们担心会死人
They're scared of Cage now. They're afraid people will die.

151
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,650
她会利用这点完成交易
She'll use that to close the deal.

152
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,220
有来电
We got a call.

153
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,070
-是她吗  -不是
- Is it her? - No.

154
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,420
是里面的固话打过来的
It's from inside. A landline.

155
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,350
我是纽约警署的普莉希拉·瑞德里探长
This is Inspector Priscilla Ridley from the NYPD.

156
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,830
请问你是哪位
Who am I speaking with?

157
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,860
我是达蒙·布恩
This is Damon Boone.

158
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,290
我收到指示  告诉你们不要靠近
I've been instructed to tell you to stay away.

159
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,250
卢克·凯奇把我们劫持为了人质
Luke Cage has taken us hostage

160
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,670
他警告说如果警察靠近
and he warns that he'll start killing people

161
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,370
他就开始杀人
if the police approach.

162
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,010
他想要什么
What does he want?

163
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,650
他...
He--

164
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:27,350
不可预测性可以增加我们的筹码
Unpredictability gives us leverage.

165
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,450
你只不过是在吓唬他们
All you're doing is scaring them.

166
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,790
让我帮你  你想要什么
Let me help you. What do you want?

167
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,900
互惠互助
Reciprocity.

168
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:39,240
局里不会有人向恐怖主义低头
No one in the department is going to bow to terrorism.

169
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,390
正合我意
Oh, I'm counting on that.

170
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,010
那个干净吗
Is that even clean?

171
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,400
足够做止血带了
Clean enough for a tourniquet.

172
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,240
你以前是童子军吗
Who were you, a Boy Scout?

173
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,030
特种侦察兵
Force Recon.

174
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,170
他们在外面肯定听到爆炸声了
They had to... hear that blast outside.

175
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,030
我该打给瑞德里
I should call Ridley.

176
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,800
该死
Oh, shit.

177
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,250
瑞德里探长...

178
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:23,200
-米丝蒂  -探长

-探长  -米丝蒂
- Inspector? - Misty.

180
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,070
-米丝蒂  -探长
- Misty. -Inspector...

181
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,700
你的手机在身上吗
Do you have your phone?

182
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,610
-我的很久以前就丢了  -该死
- I lost mine a long time ago. - Shit!

183
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:42,040
你得去楼上  知道吗
Look, you gotta go upstairs, okay?

184
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,780
那里的人需要你
Those people, they need you.

185
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,940
我不能丢下你  你会失血过多的
I can't leave you. You'll bleed out.

186
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:50,980
你会死的
You'll die.

187
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,600
我需要先稳定你的情况
I need to get you stabilized.

188
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,880
然后我会想办法
Then I'll think of some way

189
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,140
帮克莱尔和外面的其他人
to help Claire and everybody else up there.

190
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,700
你不能跟他谈判
You can't negotiate with him.

191
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:07,910
我不会的
I won't.

192
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,170
我不想...
I don't wanna...

193
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,700
我不想跟斯卡夫一样在地板上失血过多而死
I don't wanna bleed to death on the floor, like Scarfe.

194
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,740
有我在不会的
Not on my watch.

195
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:36,690
我应该喝一杯  议员
I think you deserve a drink, Councilman.

196
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:40,120
-我不喝酒  -你喝
- I don't drink. - Yes, you do.

197
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,730
没什么比得上一杯威士忌陈酿
Nothing like an aged Scotch.

198
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,960
要知道
You know...

199
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,860
如果你遇到苏格兰人
there was a time you'd cross a Scotsman...

200
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,680
他肯定毫不犹豫
and he wouldn't think twice

201
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,570
用剑把你的头砍下来
about cutting your head off with a sword.

202
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:10,540
我喜欢鼓励这种果敢的酒
I like a drink that encourages such...decisiveness.

203
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,070
我可以继续帮你跟他们谈判
I can help you negotiate even more.

204
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,320
我可以代你发言  帮你得到你想要的
I can speak for you. Get you what you want.

205
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,100
你看《圣经》吗  达蒙
You read the Bible, Damon?

206
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,960
有时候
Sometimes.

207
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,330
没有其它事可做时
When nothing else makes sense.

208
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,430
我每天都看
I read that every day.

209
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:40,320
这是我父亲给我母亲的礼物
Gift from my father to my mother.

210
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,510
我母亲去世后把它留给了我
My mother left it to me after she passed.

211
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,270
拜托
Please.

212
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,700
来吧
Go ahead.

213
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,270
哪里疼
What's hurting?

214
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,280
我的脚踝伤得很严重
I messed up my ankle real bad.

215
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,600
老实坐好
Sit your fine ass down.

216
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,870
她伤了腿  可能骨折了
She hurt her leg. It could be broken.

217
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:56,670
所以呢
So?

218
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,450
她是我最好的朋友  而我是个护士
She's my best friend, and I'm a nurse.

219
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,840
你要操心的事还不够多吗
Don't you have enough to worry about?

220
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,770
那倒是  动作快点
True. Just do it quick.

221
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,050
别使劲  好吗  都交给我
Don't help, okay? I'll do all the work.

222
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,630
我要把你的靴子脱了
I'm gonna take your boot off.

223
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,470
我明白
I see.

224
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,080
像这样动一动腿
Move your leg like this.

225
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,840
再动动脚趾
Your toes?

226
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,160
应该没有骨折
Yeah, I don't think it's a break.

227
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,320
但扭伤很严重
But it's a pretty bad sprain. -

228
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,100
你之前在抗议吗
Were you protesting?

229
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,060
我是贵宾厅的招待  你呢
I'm a VIP hostess. And you?

230
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,190
我...
Um... I was...

231
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,240
我在帮一个朋友
helping a friend.

232
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,550
-这太扯了  -抓到卢克·凯奇了吗
- This is some bullshit. - You got Luke Cage?

233
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:55,950
拜托  那黑鬼是真人版刀枪不入的胡迪尼
Please. That nigga's on that bulletproof Houdini shit for real.

234
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,250
楼下呢
What about downstairs?

235
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,360
厨房没有路能下去
There's no way downstairs from the kitchen.

236
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,750
是你朋友卢克·凯奇吗
Is your friend Luke Cage?

237
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:08,210
-你认识他吗  -想忘都难
- Do you know him? - Hard to forget.

238
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,330
他以前在这里工作
He used to work here.

239
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,180
整件事都是我的错
This whole thing is my fault.

240
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:17,380
怎么了  发生什么事了
Hey... what's happening? What's wrong?

241
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,400
我做了些非常糟的事
I did something really bad.

242
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,380
她怎么了
What's wrong with her?

243
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,450
她很痛
She's in a lot of pain.

244
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,080
告诉我
Tell me.

245
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,060
我吓坏了
I was so scared.

246
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,870
他们花钱让我说我看到卢克杀了水腹蛇
They paid me to say I saw Luke kill Cottonmouth.

247
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:39,910
他们是谁
Who's they?

248
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,490
玛莉娅·迪拉德
Mariah Dillard.

249
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,230
你想帮卢克吗
You wanna help Luke?

250
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,540
那就告诉我他怎么从厨房消失的
Then you tell me how he could have disappeared from that kitchen

251
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,460
根本没人能从那里逃脱
that no one could've escaped from.

252
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,880
这栋楼是战前的违禁建筑
This is a prewar prohibition building.

253
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,830
下面有间储藏室
There's a storage space underneath.

254
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,230
员工常常会下去消磨时间
Employees used to go down there

255
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,950
或是在有大活动的时候
to fool around or sleep between shifts

256
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,830
趁换班时去睡一觉
when we had to prep a big event.

257
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:04,410
也就是在楼下的地下室  具体位置在哪
So it's downstairs in the basement? Where?

258
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,000
在员工储物柜旁边
By the staff lockers.

259
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,060
还有谁知道吗
Would anybody else know about that?

260
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,190
只有在厨房工作的人知道
Not unless they worked in the kitchen.

261
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,380
我是这里唯一的服务人员
I'm the only person from the waitstaff here...

262
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,530
还有卢克
except Luke.

263
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,040
要进出那个储藏室
The only way in or out of that storage room

264
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,730
唯一的路就是通过厨房
is through the kitchen.

265
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,520
卢克可以砸出另一扇门
Luke can make another door.

266
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,320
好吧  我需要你晕过去
Okay, I'm gonna need you to pass out.

267
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,710
-什么  -我需要你晕过去
- What? - I need you to pass out.

268
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,230
我会把我们带出去的
I'm gonna get us out of this.

269
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,960
我的天
Oh... Oh, my God!

270
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,230
-帮帮我们  -又怎么了
- Help us! - What now?

271
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,040
-她有糖尿病  -她的药呢
- She's diabetic. - Where's her shit?

272
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,330
肯定在楼下的员工储物柜里
Uh, it must be in, uh, the staff locker downstairs.

273
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:40,550
洛佩斯  陪夜班护士到楼下去
Yo, Lopes. Escort the night nurse here downstairs.

274
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:41,840
谢谢
Thank you.

275
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,390
你照顾她一下好吗
Will you look after her?

276
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,710
我很快回来  好吗
I'll be right back, okay?

277
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,990
好的  亲爱的
Okay, baby.

278
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,800
-就在这下面  -快点
- Just down here. -Just hurry up.

279
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:11,820
你死不了
You'll live.

280
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,650
那么  你这个哥哥到底想干什么
So, what does this brother of yours want, anyway?

281
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,350
复仇
Revenge.

282
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:38,000
他陷害了我  害我进了海门监狱
He framed me. He sent me to Seagate.

283
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,190
他想把这个劫持人质的事都栽在你头上
He's trying to pin this whole hostage thing on you.

284
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,720
也是他诬陷你杀了水腹蛇吗
Did he set you up for Cottonmouth's murder, too?

285
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,560
真是他我也不会意外
I wouldn't put it past him.

286
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,110
只有你知道真相
You're the only one that knows the truth.

287
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,340
等我们出去  我需要你的帮助
I'll need your help when we get out of this.

288
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,980
没问题
You'll have it.

289
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,640
-我们得进去了  -得先有个计划才行
- We need to go in. - Not until we have a plan.

290
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,440
凯奇非常强壮  而且刀枪不入
Cage is super strong and bulletproof.

291
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,100
我们坐得越久  这疯子就越有底
The longer we sit, the more entrenched this lunatic gets.

292
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,270
我们之前跟一个人质通上了话
We've had exactly one conversation with a hostage,

293
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,880
达蒙·布恩  那个政客  结果被切断了
Damon Boone, the politician, and we got cut off.

294
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,020
我也同意进去  可我们得先计划好
Now, I am with you on going in, but we need a plan.

295
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:32,270
我们以前没经历过这种事
We've never faced anything like this before.

296
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:38,930
瑞德里探长  我是地检官布莱克·托尔
Inspector Ridley? Blake Tower, DA's Office.

297
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:41,970
-托尔先生  怎么了  -您来告诉我
- Mr. Tower. What's going on? - You tell me.

298
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,320
我们一直在密切关注凯奇的动向
We've been closely following Cage's activities.

299
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,210
市长会希望我帮忙协调的
The mayor would like me to help coordinate.

300
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:49,060
-已经协调好了  -是吗
- The situation is coordinated. - Really?

301
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,140
我们是同一边的
We're on the same side...

302
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,350
我想指导你们如何最好地达成
...and I'd like to guide you as how best to achieve an outcome

303
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,950
对各方都有利的结果
that's beneficial to all parties.

304
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,310
最有利的结果
Yeah, the most beneficial outcome

305
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:02,170
就是我把人质和我的警探活着带出来
is for me to get those hostages and my detective out alive,

306
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,100
并给卢克·凯奇带上手铐
and Luke Cage in cuffs.

307
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,050
这些你都给不了我
None of which you can give me.

308
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,290
-探长  -怎么
- Inspector? - Yeah.

309
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:08,440
有人确认
We have independent confirmation

310
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,260
爆炸是来自内部的
that the explosion came from inside.

311
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,050
-现在能进去了吗  -我们等着
- Now can we go in? - We wait.

312
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,440
万一他直接把这些人都开枪打死了呢
What if he just shoots all those people dead?

313
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,660
那不是凯奇的做法
That is not Cage's MO.

314
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:20,020
我们每次与他交锋  他从来没使用过枪
Every encounter we've ever had with him, he's never used a gun.

315
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,240
他根本不用
He doesn't have to.

316
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,020
他现在开始用了吧
Well, he's using one now, isn't he?

317
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,780
我看过那个车载视频
Well, I saw that dashcam video.

318
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,580
他几秒钟就能干掉你整个小队
He can take out your whole team in mere seconds

319
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,720
而且毫发无伤
and not get a scratch.

320
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,640
我同意
I agree.

321
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,760
为了拿下这个混蛋  我们必须加大警力
In order to engage this asshole, we need to bring the heat.

322
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,760
你有什么主意吗  助理地检先生
You got any ideas Mr., uh, ADA?

323
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,740
市长现在正在闭门
Look, the mayor is in a closed-door session

324
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,220
是否应该加强执法部门配备的武器
discussing enhanced weapons for law enforcement.

325
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,170
和谁
With who?

326
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,120
玛莉娅·迪拉德
Mariah Dillard.

327
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:48,960
怎么了
What's wrong?

328
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,160
得系紧点
It needs to be tighter.

329
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,740
振作一点
Brace yourself.

330
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,240
一
One...

331
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,520
我感觉我要像克里斯珀斯·阿塔克斯一样了
I feel like getting my Crispus Attucks on up there.

332
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,020
你聪明多了
You gotta be smart about this.

333
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,090
外面有太多无辜的民众
There are too many innocent people up there

334
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,550
可能会丧命
who could end up dead.

335
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,480
我也许别无选择
I might not have a choice.

336
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:22,150
我曾经有选择
I had a choice.

337
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,450
我应该相信你的
I should have trusted you.

338
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,300
我知道
I know.

339
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,940
这样说也没法让我好受
You didn't make it easy.

340
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,190
别去干蠢事
Don't go doing anything stupid.

341
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,370
比如什么
Like what?

342
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,160
逞英雄
Be a hero.

343
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,360
我不是什么英雄
I'm not the hero type.

344
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,410
你确定吗
Are you sure?

345
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,630
在我看来你一直都是
Looks to me like that's what you've always been.

346
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:08,800
你听到了吗
You hear that?

347
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,350
你为什么不离开那个酒吧
Why the hell didn't you leave the club?

348
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:52,580
我什么时候乖乖听过话
When have I ever done as I was told?

349
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:59,970
米丝蒂  米丝蒂
Misty! Misty!

350
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,530
是  长官  当然了
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

351
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,190
怎么了
What's going on?

352
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,070
我们也许有办法对付卢克·凯奇了
We might have something to take Luke Cage out.

353
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:12,610
一种尚未得到授权的试验型武器
An experimental weapon that's never been authorized before.

354
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:15,330
-有人在暗中操纵  是你吗  -不
- Someone's pulling strings. Is that you? - No.

355
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:19,280
那就是  玛莉娅·迪拉德  你帮她联系睡了吗
Then it's Mariah Dillard. Did you put her in touch with someone?

356
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:21,440
布恩又来电了
It's Boone again.

357
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:29,700
布恩先生  你没事吧
Mr. Boone. Are you okay?

358
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:32,590
卢克·凯奇想告诉你他的要求
Luke Cage would like to give you his demands.

359
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,640
我们洗耳恭听
We're listening.

360
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,360
他要你往屋顶上派一辆直升机
He wants a chopper on the roof.

361
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,180
为表诚意  凯奇先生愿意
As a sign of goodwill, Mr. Cage is willing

362
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,690
在电话结束后释放一半人质
to let half the hostages go at the end of this call.

363
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,370
留下我和其他一部分人  确保他能顺利逃脱
Me and a few others will remain to ensure his escape.

364
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,390
我们马上去办
We will get right on that.

365
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,650
奈特警官还活着吗
Is Detective Knight still alive?

366
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,470
是的  她还活着
Yes. Yes, she is.

367
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,650
我们需要证实她还活着  才能继续帮你们
We will need proof of life before we proceed.

368
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:58,340
不
No.

369
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,590
他说你没有资格提要求
He's saying you're not in a position to make demands.

370
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,440
那就有麻烦了
Well, then we have a problem.

371
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:06,360
他说马上释放一部分人质
He says a few hostages will be coming out now.

372
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,620
-明白  -他在拖时间
- Got it! - He's stalling.

373
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,360
我知道她在干什么  他可以直接杀出去的
I know what he's doing. He could just want a way out.

374
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,560
我们得继续拖住他  直到新武器运到
We should keep on stalling him until the new weapons show up.

375
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,590
我只接受局长的命令
I take my orders from the chief.

376
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,010
到底怎么回事
What's really going on here?

377
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,800
我想让我们用一种
Do I want us to use a weapon

378
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,700
能干掉刀枪不入者的武器吗
that can take out a man that's bulletproof?

379
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:25,070
-当然不想了  -我不明白
- Absolutely not. - I don't understand.

380
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:27,930
警方或军队所使用的武器
Look, any weapon that the police or military has

381
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,710
最后都会出现在街头
eventually ends up on the street.

382
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,260
你应该知道即使只是展示一下威力都很危险
You know it's dangerous to even show that kind of power.

383
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,310
但我觉得我们别无选择
Hey, but I don't see we got much of a choice.

384
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:40,050
-我不信任玛莉娅·迪拉德  -我也不信
- I don't trust Mariah Dillard. - Yeah, I don't either.

385
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,710
但她打通了我们上级的关系
But she has juice with people way above our paygrade.

386
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,510
我只是不想
I just don't want this

387
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,500
让这演变成OK牧场的大枪战
to turn into the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.

388
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,310
弗兰克·卡塞尔让整个城市变为抵御
Frank Castle shot the city to hell,

389
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,980
他也只有普通的子弹
and he only had regular bullets.

390
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,900
想象一下万一他这种人用这种武器能干什么
Now imagine what he or somebody like him can do with these things.

391
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,320
我明白  你在这里没看到谁
Yeah, I hear you. Who is the one person you don't see here?

392
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,340
局长
A chief.

393
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:01,310
那是什么意思  他要保持距离  推诿
And what does that tell you? He wants distance. Deniability.

394
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,060
如果出错  负责的就是我
If this goes wrong, the blood is on my hands,

395
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,830
-只有我  -探长
- and mine alone. - Inspector.

396
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,330
门打开了
There's movement at the door.

397
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,160
小心  他出来了  不要开火
Eyes up. He's coming out. Hold fire.

398
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,580
手  把你们的手举起来
Hands! Hands! Put your hands in the air!

399
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:22,640
往前走
Step forward.

400
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,680
快  我们走  我们走
Come on, let's go! Let's go!

401
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,720
-快点  -没错  这边走  快
- Move it, come on! - That's right. This way! Go, go!

402
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:32,670
安全
We're clear.

403
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,170
-带他们离开这里  -跟我来
- Get them out of here. Come on. - Follow me.

404
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:48,890
直接贯穿了
Well, it went clean through.

405
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,620
你失血过多
You've lost a lot of blood.

406
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,840
我在那种情况下
I handled the situation the best I could

407
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,420
已经尽力处理了  克莱尔
under the circumstances, Claire.

408
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,520
她没被轰飞胳膊算你走运
Yeah, you're lucky she didn't lose her arm.

409
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,860
离伤口太近了
That is way too close to the wound.

410
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:07,610
我只会治病  你只会防弹
Me, medical shit. You, bulletproof shit.

411
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,740
你们听上去都结婚了
Y'all sound married.

412
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,570
很好
That's good.

413
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,570
我去拿点东西
I'm gonna get some stuff.

414
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:26,460
我妈妈喜欢白人灵魂音乐
Oh, my mama loved blue-eyed soul.

415
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:39,920
你要是有机会见我母亲黛娜就好了
I wish you could have met Dana...my mother.

416
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,840
-她很美  -是的
- She's beautiful. - Yes.

417
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:52,820
她曾是一个著名牧师的秘书
She was a secretary for a big-time preacher.

418
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,140
他是一个大胆自信有魅力的人
A bold, charismatic man who...

419
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,760
喜欢高谈阔论  衣着光鲜
loved to talk loud and dress fancy.

420
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,660
-跟你一样  -是的
- Like you. - Exactly.

421
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:04,900
他们一起工作的时间很长  很有压力
They worked long, stressful hours and...

422
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,940
他们在后勤办公室度过了很多愉快的日子
Well, they had a lot of laughter in that back office.

423
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,580
注定要发生一些事  然后
Something was bound to happen and...

424
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,460
就发生了
it did.

425
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,270
我出生了
I was born.

426
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,810
但他已经结婚了
But he was married.

427
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,810
本来一切都很好
And everything was good...

428
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:31,100
直到牧师的妻子在两年后生了一个儿子
until the preacher's wife, two years later, had a baby boy.

429
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:33,710
一个奇迹般的孩子
A miracle child.

430
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:37,180
所以一切都变了
And everything changed.

431
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,960
伟大的卢卡斯牧师
The great Reverend Lucas

432
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,090
没胆让自己的大儿子跟自己姓
wasn't man enough to give his first son his last name.

433
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:46,030
所以我仍然是威利斯·斯崔克
You see, I was still Willis Stryker.

434
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,400
但他真正的儿子
But his real son...

435
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:50,120
是卡尔·卢卡斯
was Carl Lucas.

436
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:54,140
但是  扯淡的是
But... here's the crazy thing.

437
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:57,420
没人说什么
Nobody said nothing.

438
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,680
卡尔和我
And Carl and I...

439
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,590
我们从小就是好朋友  但是
we grew up best friends, but...

440
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,320
我们之间却有一种无形的竞争
there was all this tension.

441
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:07,700
你能真真切切感觉到
You could just feel it

442
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:10,990
就像一阵风从门那边传来
like a draft coming in from under a door.

443
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,740
我只想让他看到我
I just wanted him to see me.

444
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,340
我是个好孩子
I was a good boy.

445
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,830
我学习成绩很好
I did well in school.

446
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,570
但他总是更爱卡尔
But he always loved Carl more.

447
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,830
探长  借一步说话
Inspector? A word?

448
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,330
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

449
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:48,660
一些人质的证词跟我们所知的情况不符
Some of the hostages' statements are not matching up.

450
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,850
大部分人说的是看到里面的人朝凯奇开枪
Most are saying that they saw people inside shooting at Cage,

451
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,350
不是凯奇朝他们
not the other way around.

452
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:56,630
我们可能搞错了
We might have this all wrong.

453
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,930
有这个可能
We might.

454
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,100
一会儿我们有时间弄清楚到底是怎么回事
We'll have time to get to the bottom of what's going on later.

455
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,240
但现在我们需要控制住这一局面
But right now, we need to get control of this situation,

456
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:05,760
目前我们还没有控制权
and we are not in control yet.

457
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,120
你  不要四处看了
You! Stop looking around!

458
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:24,690
-第一批人质出去了  -很好
- The first of the hostages are gone. - Good.

459
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,150
你不担心他们会说什么吗
You're not worried about what they're gonna say?

460
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,340
等有人弄明白
By the time anyone figures out the truth,

461
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,260
哈莱姆的威胁就已经死了
Harlem's Menace will be dead

462
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,430
否则就是我死
or I will.

463
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,390
我不会去作证的  你呢
I ain't testifying. Are you?

464
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,520
我为什么要作证
Why would I?

465
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,720
你真的想让我确认你根本没有计划吗
Would you really want me to confirm that you had no plan?

466
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:44,850
你想想那样会让我们两个人看起来多蠢
Think about how stupid that would make both of us look.

467
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:47,470
你忘记自己在跟谁说话了吗
Have you forgotten who you're talking to?

468
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,540
你忘了吗
Have you?

469
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:54,550
-你说的直升机呢  -拜托
- What about the helicopter? - Please.

470
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:56,840
他们肯定不会同意
There's no way they'll agree to that.

471
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,770
我知道
I know.

472
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,130
什么事
What happened?

473
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,980
-洛佩斯被人从楼梯上推下来了  -什么
- Lopes got pushed down the stairs. - What?

474
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,850
一个人质晕倒了
One of the hostages passed out,

475
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:08,120
另一个去拿药品
and another one went to go get her medication.

476
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:11,140
-哪个人质  -贵宾室的服务生
- Which hostage? - The waitress from VIP.

477
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,880
西印长相的那个妞
The West Indian-lookin' chick.

478
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,710
坎迪斯  天啊
Candace. God...

479
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:24,130
-另一个找到了吗  -没有
- Did you find the other one? - No.

480
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,620
我和响尾蛇还没说完话  糖糖
Diamondback and I aren't finished speaking, Sugar.

481
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,640
所以你们都先回避一下
So I'm gonna need y'all to fall back.

482
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,740
是我不好
My bad.

483
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,220
怎么了
What?

484
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:42,550
玛莉娅就是利用坎迪斯
Candace is the one that Mariah used

485
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:45,320
把水腹蛇谋杀案扣到了卢克·凯奇头上
to pin Cottonmouth's murder on Luke Cage.

486
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,360
-另一个  -可能就是在诊所捅我的那个人
- The other one-- - Is probably the one who stabbed me at the clinic.

487
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,480
该死  我就说她看着眼熟
Damn it. I knew she looked familiar.

488
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,220
她可能是跟凯奇一起进来的
She probably came in with Cage.

489
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,050
坎迪斯知道凯奇长什么样
Candace knows what Cage looks like.

490
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:57,310
另一个跟他一起的妞  如果让她逃了
The other chick with him, if she escapes...

491
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,830
她们任何一个人都可能揭穿我们的幌子
Either one of them could blow our cover story.

492
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,450
-她们都得处理掉  -那就去处理掉
- They all got to go. - Take care of it then.

493
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:09,010
你和我  等这件事结束
You and me, we get out of this...

494
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:12,260
我们要促膝长谈一番
we're gonna have a long talk.

495
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,630
你好好记着
Best believe that.

496
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,940
我们去楼下
Let's go. Downstairs.

497
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,730
卡尔  卡尔  卡尔
Carl, Carl, Carl.

498
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,350
你又这样了
Here you go again.

499
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,560
躲躲藏藏  就因为你太胆小不敢正面应战
Bobbing and weaving because you're too scared to take a hit.

500
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:39,890
就跟我教你打的拳一样
It's just like I taught you in the ring.

501
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:43,070
不管你怎么躲
No matter how much you duck,

502
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:46,690
最终你都要站出来的
eventually, you're gonna have to knuck and buck.

503
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,320
如果你自己和米丝蒂·奈特
If you don't surrender yourself...

504
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,490
不出来投降
and Misty Knight...

505
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:58,320
我要每十分钟杀一个人质
I'm gonna kill a hostage every ten minutes...

506
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,710
从达蒙·布恩开始
starting with Damon Boone.

507
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,820
他是认真的
He's not bluffing.

508
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,770
-我要去除掉他  -他设好陷阱在等你
- I gotta take him out. - You're walking into a trap.

509
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:12,320
-你很清楚  -正合我意
- You know that. - I'm counting on it.

510
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:15,170
要赢不总是要打一架
You don't always have to fight to win.

511
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:18,480
如果出问题  我们目前被警察包围了
Look, if things go south, we are surrounded by cops.

512
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,880
我会确保他们知道你是清白的
I'll make sure that they know you're innocent.

513
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,960
他们会知道真相  我保证
They'll know the truth, I promise.

514
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,090
不要为了我而死  米丝蒂
Don't go dying on me, Misty.

515
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:29,070
-有我在就不会的  -他基本上就是这一套
- Not on my watch. - Hmm. That's usually his line.

516
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:32,420
他们利用女服务员坎迪斯来陷害你
They used that waitress, Candace, to frame you.

517
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,570
混蛋骗子
Lyin' ass.

518
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:35,900
她在哪里
Where is she?

519
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:37,320
和其他人一起在楼上
Upstairs with the others.

520
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:43,900
如果他有更多的这种特殊的子弹怎么办
What if he has more of those special bullets?

521
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,900
我也只能冒险
That's a chance I'll have to take.

522
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:49,810
如果我陷入了麻烦  你必须要保护好自己
If I don't walk away from this, you need to lay in the cut

523
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:52,560
除非你得到了波比·菲什或者米丝蒂的消息
until you hear from me, Bobby Fish or Misty.

524
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,730
其他人都不可信
No one else.

525
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,640
-你知道我很服从命令的  -我是认真的
- You know how well I follow orders. - I'm serious.

526
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,800
威利斯是认真的
Willis plays for keeps...

527
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:03,280
尤其对我最在乎的人下手
especially with people I care about the most.

528
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:06,800
答应我
Promise me.

529
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:10,980
我会的
I will.

530
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,720
-你有可以躲的地方吗  -有的
- You have a place in mind? - Yeah.

531
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,810
你要小心
Be careful.

532
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,700
一直如此
Always.

533
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:22,450
真是多愁善感
You're so corny.

534
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:41,200
就这样别动  胳膊朝上
Keep that right there, okay? Arm turned up.

535
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,040
我操
Shit!

536
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,150
你可以先提醒我的
You could've warned me.

537
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,260
是  我本来可以的
Yeah, I could've.

538
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:54,290
告诉我你接下来要做什么
Talk me through what you're about to do.

539
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:59,070
好的  我马上要用这个牙线
Okay. I am gonna use this dental floss...

540
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,040
给你的手臂静脉
to tie off your...

541
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:05,230
-打个结 -我感觉我要吐了
- hosing vein. - I think I'm gonna throw up.

542
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,460
这里
There.

543
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:14,150
这可以切断你手掌和小臂的血液输送
This is gonna cut the blood supply to your hand and your forearm.

544
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,530
它在你体内越久
The longer this stays in...

545
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:20,410
你失去手臂的可能性就越高
the higher the chances of losing your arm.

546
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,490
我想跟你道歉
Look, I want to apologize.

547
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,790
我不应该对你发脾气
I shouldn't have lost my cool with you.

548
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:29,640
这世道都疯了  你这么做也无可厚非
Ah, you can't be to blame with this kind of crazy.

549
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:32,330
感觉你已经非常习惯了
Well, you're in pretty deep.

550
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:36,000
是的  麻烦就像前男友一样不停地找上我
Yeah, well, trouble stalks me like a crazy ex-boyfriend.

551
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:39,120
我懂你
I hear you.

552
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:43,050
你和卢克去喝咖啡了吗
You and Luke go out for coffee yet?

553
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,300
我们还没时间去
Uh, we haven't had time.

554
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,320
他不喜欢喝咖啡
He doesn't like coffee.

555
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,220
我知道
I know.

556
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:55,780
弄好了
All done.

557
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,100
天啊  你真棒
Damn, you're good.

558
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,720
各司其职  各善其事
You're good at your job, I'm good at mine.

559
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,150
玛莉娅跟市长说过了  枪流行了起来
Mariah talked to the mayor. The guns are a go.

560
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,210
祝你好运  兄弟
Good luck, brother.

561
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:17,110
迪拉德议员一直在给我惊喜
Councilwoman Dillard never ceases to amaze me.

562
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,300
压力之下
Pressure...

563
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,510
有些人才会脱颖而出
brings the best out of certain people.

564
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:25,920
我说到哪了
So... where was I?

565
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,470
团结一心
Together...

566
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,790
我们所向披靡
we were bold.

567
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:33,870
就像歌里唱的  我们偷了一辆红色的克尔维特
We stole a red Corvette, just like the song...

568
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:37,070
去驾车游玩
just... for a joyride.

569
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:39,590
那时候我喜欢普林斯
You see, I was a Prince fan, and...

570
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,970
卡尔最喜欢迈克尔
Carl was all about Michael.

571
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:46,030
我们忙着争吵  都没有看见警察
We were so busy arguing, we didn't even see the cop.

572
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,910
光芒
但是卡尔是卢卡斯But Carl was a Lucas.

573
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:51,990
悍将
我是斯崔克I was a Stryker.

574
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,510
还未开始  胜负已分
It was over before it even began.

575
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,020
到了法庭宣判的时候
When it came time for sentencing,

576
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:02,350
牧师劝说法官
the preacher convinced the judge

577
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:04,880
让他的宝贝孩子参加了海军陆战队
to let his golden boy join the Marines.

578
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,700
我呢
Me?

579
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,690
是个少年罪犯
Juvie.

580
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:12,060
经常卷入到各种斗殴之中
Got jumped two days in.

581
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,740
有个男孩拿着一把刀
Boy drew a shank and...

582
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:21,390
我出于自卫杀了他
...I killed him in self-defense.

583
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,420
从此我的好日子就到头了
So I got sent away to hard time.

584
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:31,130
至于亲爱的黛娜
And sweet Dana?

585
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:38,310
癌症吞噬了她  她只能在避难所
Oh, her cancer ate her alive and she died alone...

586
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,780
孤独地死去
in a shelter...

587
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,700
连个朋友都没有
without a friend in the world.

588
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,090
这个善良的牧师卢卡斯
You see, the good Reverend Lucas...

589
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:53,370
在我走之后也不再关心她了
well, he stopped caring for her after I was gone.

590
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,900
他抛弃了她
He was free of her...

591
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,200
我无能为力
and I was powerless.

592
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,560
但是她
But she, oh...

593
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:05,500
她仍然深爱着他
Oh, she still loved him...

594
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:11,450
而且她希望我能继承我爸爸的一些优点
and... well, she wanted me to have something of my father's.

595
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:16,010
上帝让我接触到了《创世纪》
God had me at hello with Genesis.

596
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,380
这就是该隐与亚伯的故事
The story of Cain and Abel.

597
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:23,630
当上帝问在该隐杀掉亚伯之后问他亚伯在哪时
When God asked Cain where Abel was after he killed him...

598
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:27,800
该隐问  "我是弟弟的守护者吗"
Cain asked, "Am I my brother's keeper?"

599
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,390
你看
See...

600
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:32,150
我以为这些很棒的东西都是
I thought that was some cool shit

601
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,840
韦斯利·斯奈普斯在《纽约黑街》里虚构的
Wesley Snipes made up in New Jack City.

602
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,140
最后发现
Turns out...

603
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,990
这是真的
it's real.

604
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:48,570
所以
So...

605
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:52,090
我杀了卢克·凯奇之后
after I kill Luke Cage...

606
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:55,850
我要踩在他身上说
I'm gonna stand over him and say,

607
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,910
"是的  我是"
"Yes, I am."

608
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:14,160
为什么你告诉我这些
Why are you telling me all this?

609
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,330
因为你要去见我的母亲了  达蒙
Because you're about to meet my mother, Damon.

610
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,480
告诉她我爱她
Tell her I love her.

611
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:45,350
沙兹  把布恩议员放在门口
Shades, show Councilman Boone to the door.

612
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,370
-门  -门开了
- Door! - Opening door!

613
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,420
举起手来
Put your hands in the air!

614
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,540
快上  我们上  散开  前进
Go, go, go. Let's go. Let's spread in. Move in.

615
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,610
快  抬他起来
Let's go, guys. Get him up. Get him up.

616
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,920
来人抬他的脚
Someone grab his feet.

617
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,570
他死了
He's dead.

618
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,920
胸口炸了一个大洞
Chest is caved in.

619
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,210
赶紧进去
Move in now.

00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,110

At this time, we still have no clear idea what Luke Cage wants.

626
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:45,910
-怎么回事  -转过去
- What's going on? - Turn around.

627
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,420
我看卢克·凯奇来过这里
I see Luke Cage was here.

628
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,070
我来帮你
Let me help you.

629
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:41,590
好了
Okay.

630

你还有一手
You got skills.

631
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:58,180
彼此彼此
Likewise.

632
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:00,710
我父亲
My father.

633
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:03,740
我叔叔
My uncle.

634
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:12,450
好  继续等命令
All right. Still waiting on word.

635
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,290
希望他们知道这武器的威力
I hope they know what they're authorizing.

636
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:22,210
我们主要的目标应该是解救人质
Our main focus should be freeing the hostages.

637
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:24,160
除非必要  他们不应该开枪
They shouldn't shoot unless absolutely necessary.

638
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,540
我的人知道该怎么做  别废话了  让我们上
My men know the job. Stop meddling and let us get to work.

639
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,950
也许不是卢克·凯奇干的
Luke Cage might not be behind this.

640
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:35,150
等我看到他后我会问他的
I'll ask him when I see him.

641
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,970
谁都不许动
Nobody move.

642
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:53,940
我是认真的
I ain't playing.

643
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:03,840
这边
This way.

644
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,000

653
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:29,030
去找卢克·凯奇进行对峙
to allegedly confront Luke Cage.

654
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:33,960
-放开他  -我会的
- Let her go. - Oh, we'll get to that.

655
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:38,640
我们很久以前就应该讲和
Couldn't we have made amends a long time ago?

656
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,690
你小时候就该去死
Couldn't you have died during childbirth?

657
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:44,450
冷静点
Easy there.

658
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:55,430
对于黛娜的事我很遗憾
I was sorry to hear about Dana.

659
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:59,160
我一直很喜欢她
I always liked her.

660
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:03,260
我完全忍受不了埃特  真是个贱人
I couldn't stand Etta. What a bitch!

661
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,210
我们有致命的武器  凯奇
We have lethal rounds, Cage

662
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:16,770
-我们会使用它们  -该走了
- We will use them. - Gotta go.

你杀了那名人质后
With that hostage you killed,

664
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:21,250
他们肯定会先开枪再问问题
they're gonna shoot first and ask questions later.

665
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:24,940
玛莉娅给那些军队提供了犹大升级版
Mariah supplied the force with some Judas 2.0s,

666
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:27,050
这样就不会从你身上弹开
so they won't bounce off of you.

667
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:28,300
而是会直破你的皮肤
They'll stick.

668
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:32,140
你要跑吗  小甜心
You gonna run, Miracle Whip?

669
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:34,870
还是说你想救这名少女
Or you gonna save the damsel?

00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:26,150
-你想离开这里吗  -是的
- You want to get out of here, right? - Yeah.

681
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:29,600

Okay. This way. This way.

682
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,790
我说赶紧举起手来
I said in the air, now!

683
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:49,330
-你有车吗  -水腹蛇有三辆
- Hey, you got a ride? - Cottonmouth had three.

684
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:58,710
起作用了
It worked.

685
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:01,070
他们抓到了他  根本不用开枪
They got him. Didn't even have to fire.

686
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:03,550
那才是最重要的  这些武器会改变一切
That's all that matters. Those weapons are a game changer.

687
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:06,000
-希望永远用不上  -探长
- Hope we never have to use them. - Inspector.

688
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:09,800
你没事吧
Are you okay?

689
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:12,210
听着  卢克·凯奇是无辜的
Listen, Luke Cage is innocent.

690
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:14,940
事情并不像你们所见的这样
What you think you saw is not what happened.

691
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:16,720
你不如先专心养好身体
Why don't you focus on getting fixed up?

692
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,980
让我们来收拾乱子吧
Let us clean up this mess.

693
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:22,430
都是威利斯·斯崔克惹出来的  是他朝我开枪
This mess is Willis Stryker's doing. He's the one who shot me.

694
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,030
听着  他叫响尾蛇
Listen, his name is Diamondback.

695
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:26,310
我相信你  米丝蒂
I believe you, Misty.

696
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,980
我们还要找很多人谈话
There are dozens of other people to talk to.

697
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:29,910
卢克还要为阿尔比尼之死
And Luke is still wanted for Albini's murder,

698
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:31,720
水腹蛇之死  和袭警负责
Cottonmouth's murder, and attacking those cops.

699
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,670
你没听明白
You are not listening to me.

700
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:38,360
卢克·凯奇是完全无辜的
Luke Cage is innocent of everything.

701
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,570
等我们羁押他后  我们会证实的
And after we have him in custody, we'll verify it.

702
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:43,310
听着  我相信你
Look... I trust you.

703
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:44,430
真的
I do.

704
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:46,830
但我们得证实
But we have to verify.

705
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:52,480
唯一重要的事  就是真相
The only thing that matters is the truth.

706
00:47:57,410 --> 00:47:59,670
没事的  警探  让我看看你的手臂
We got you, Detective. Let me look at your arm.

707
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:03,920
不管你要干什么  在这里赶紧了事
Listen, whatever you need to do, you need to do it right here.

708
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,790
我哪儿也不去  还不能走
Okay? I'm not going anywhere. Not yet.

709
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:18,230
我们走
Let's go.

710
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:45,660
那是卢克·凯奇
Yo! That's Luke Cage!

711
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:48,540
-快看  -就是他
- Check him out, man! - That's him!

712
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,800
那是卢克
Yo, B! There go Luke!

713
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:54,570
我们知道你是无辜的  卢克
We know you innocent, Luke!

714
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:07,820
快走
Go.
