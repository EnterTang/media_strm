《无垠的太空》前情提要
Previously on The Expanse...

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:07,720
他缺氧了
He's hypoxic.

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:09,840
他的呼吸器不行了
His breather's crapping out!

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,280
你可以吸我的氧
You can breathe off mine, okay?

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,580
深呼吸
Breathe it in.

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,330
我叫詹姆斯·霍顿
My name is James Holden,

7
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,230
信息已收取
发送坐标

8
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,890
代表坎特伯雷号的五名幸存者
speaking for the five survivors of the Canterbury.

9
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:19,100
我们的飞船回应了来自海岩号的
Our ship was destroyed answering

10
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,020
假求救信号后被毁
a bogus sos from a ship called the Scopuli.

11
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,580
我们马上要被带进火星舰队的唐纳吉尔号
We are about to be taken aboard the MCRN Donnager.

12
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,590
-亚历克斯 把他关了 -我们有权请
- Alex, shut him down! - We have the right to legal...

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
天啊 毛小姐 你可真会挑人
Good golly, Ms. Mao. You sure can pick 'em.

14
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,850
麦迪纳现在实行宵禁
Curfew is now in effect on Medina level.

15
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,100
你觉得我是外行星联盟的吗
Do you think I'm OPA?

16
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,450
这些都是恐怖分子的特有技能
These are the hallmark skill sets of terrorists.

17
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,760
不是火星摧毁的坎特伯雷号
Mars didn't destroy the Canterbury.

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,790
那是谁干的
Then who did?

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,590
在我加入坎特号之前
I flew with the Mars Navy for 20 years

20
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:47,970
我在火星舰队飞了二十多年
before I shipped off on the Cant.

21
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:48,890
你是外行星联盟的人吗
Are you OPA?

22
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,520
我们把事情都摊开来说吧
We putting all our cards on the table here?

23
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,480
-潜伏特工 你们听说过没有 -去死吧
- Sleeper agents. You ever heard of them? - Well, screw you...

24
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,400
-伙计 -人盾 你听过吗
- Guys! - Human shields, you ever heard of those?

25
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,520
我准备好谈话了 但是只和你们舰长谈
Hey! I'm ready to talk, but only to your Captain.

26
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,860
各位 已经结束了 回家去吧
Come on, guys, it's over. Just... Just go home.

27
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,580
还没结束 地球人 这才刚开始
It's not over, Earther. It's just beginning

28
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,330
不不不
No, no, no!

29
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,990
谷神星_空间站
位于小行星带

30
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,850
抱歉让你久等 我们今天有点忙
Sorry to keep you waiting, we've been busier than usual.

31
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:39,060
还不断从麦迪纳送过来 连上城的都有
Still getting intakes from all over the Medina, even from uptown.

32
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,780
你知道地球的人均预期寿命是多少吗
You know what the average life expectancy on Earth is?

33
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,910
不知道
No.

34
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,510
123岁 火星上还要更长
123 years. It's even better on Mars.

35
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,690
你知道谷神星上是多少吗 68岁
You know what it is on Ceres? 68.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,200
加上最近这些不幸的事
And with the recent unpleasantness,

37
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,890
这个数字只会更低
that average is only going down.

38
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,250
怎么了
What?

39
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,190
没什么 我肯定你比看起来年轻
Nothing. I'm sure you're younger than you look.

40
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,280
尸检中
扫描受损情况

41
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,550
死者身份是比齐·贝迪克
Stiff's ID is Bizi Betiko.

42
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,850
贝迪克
比齐
谷神星
12区42层
男性

43
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,710
他的文件里没有写宗教丧葬要求
You know, there is no religious directive on file,

44
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,650
所以我可以把他送去资源回收吗
so okay if I recycle him?

45
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,750
39层的工厂需要一些肥料
Factory on 39 needs some fertilizer.

46
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,060
先不要
Not yet.

47
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,330
火星舰队_唐纳吉尔号
木星附近

48
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,370
我想知道霍顿
I'd like to know what the hell

49
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,590
到底在和舰长讨论什么
Holden is discussing with the Captain right now.

50
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,530
他完全有可能是在谈交易
For all we know, he could be working out a deal.

51
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,630
是啊 为他自己的交易
Yeah, for himself.

52
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,480
我只看到一艘船朝这里驶来
The only thing I see here is an incoming ship.

53
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,540
你们都查不出是什么船
One you can't even identify.

54
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,980
又怎么知道他们是为了奈奥米来的
How do you know they're coming for Naomi?

55
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,780
我们不知道 只是个猜测
We don't. It's a guess.

56
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,740
你们说奈奥米是外行星联盟的人也是猜测吧
And you're just guessing Naomi's OPA, too.

57
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,760
你我都知道那可不只是猜测
We both know that's better than a guess.

58
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,660
到目前为止 她是你们中最会说谎的人
She is the best liar amongst all of you, by far.

59
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,780
而且她隐瞒了什么 你也能感觉到
And she is hiding something. You can sense that, too.

60
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,640
我不相信她是恐怖分子
I don't believe she's a terrorist.

61
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,090
就算她是 我也不相信坎特伯雷号是她炸的
And even if she was, I'm not blaming her for the Canterbury.

62
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,180
你说是我们炸的
You blamed it on us.

63
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,580
我们在诱我们去海岩号的信号源里
We found Martian Naval tech

64
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,330
发现了火星舰队的技术
in the beacon that lured us to the Scopuli,

65
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,330
然后你们就出现了
and then you showed up.

66
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,630
我们跟坎特伯雷号的事毫无关系
We had nothing to do with the Canterbury,

67
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,210
但就因为你 地球认为是我们炸毁了它
but because of you, Earth thinks we destroyed it.

68
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,620
有些人在说这是战争行为
Some people are calling it an act of war.

69
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,200
你得宣布撤回声明
You need to recant.

70
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,380
说是永田干的 不管是不是真的
Blame Nagata. True or not,

71
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,800
这都能改变情况 直到人们冷静下来
it will change the narrative until cooler heads prevail

72
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,510
查出究竟是怎么回事
and figure out what really happened.

73
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,680
我不会那样做的
I won't do it.

74
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,080
有人在玩什么把戏
There's some kind of game being played here.

75
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,050
或许有人想要引发一场战争 我不知道
Maybe someone wants a war, I don't know,

76
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,730
但如果你们真的想要阻止战争发生
but if you really do want to stop it,

77
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,500
那就放了我们 然后我们再谈
then let us go and then we talk.

78
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,890
舰长 驶近船只
Captain, inbound vessel

79
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,440
正在进入防御范围 一分钟后接触界线
approaching defense perimeter. One minute to contact.

80
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,340
-呼叫他们 -呼叫频道打开
- Hail them. - Frequencies open.

81
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,690
不明身份船只
Unidentified vessel,

82
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,190
我是火星舰队唐纳吉尔号舰长特雷莎·姚
this is Captain Theresa Yao, of the MCRN Donnager.

83
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,230
这是对你们的最后一次警告
This is your final warning.

84
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,490
如果你们继续前进 我们就要开火了
If you maintain your present course you will be fired upon.

85
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,840
他们干扰了我们的通讯
They're jamming us.

86
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,750
检测到多个快速移动物体
Multiple fast movers detected!

87
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,440
不只一艘船 我数有六艘敌舰
More than one ship. I count six bandits.

88
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,980
导弹发射警报
Missile launch alert.

89
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,140
拉响全舰警报 全体人员进入战斗岗位
Sound general quarters. All hands, battle stations.

90
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,780
准备还击
Prepare to return fire.

91
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,600
发生什么事了
What's happening?

92
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,630
这是战斗模式照明 一定是演习
That's battle mode lighting. Must be a drill.

93
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,750
好吧 那是什么
Okay, what's that?

94
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,410
听起来像是在发射鱼雷
It sounds like torpedoes being fired.

95
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,780
听起来发射了很多鱼雷
Sounds like a lot of torpedoes.

96
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,070
我觉得这不是演习
I don't think it's a drill.

97
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,040
或许我们应该系上安全带
Maybe we should get strapped in.

98
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,920
好主意
Good idea.

99
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:14,380
鱼雷已发射 导航系统锁定所有目标
Torpedoes are away! Guidance lock on all targets.

100
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,860
不管他们是谁 不管他们是来干什么的
Well, whoever they are, and whatever they've come to do,

101
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,210
这都刚刚变成了一项自杀任务
it's just become a suicide mission.

102
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,850
是他们挑起战斗的 而我们会结束这场战斗
They started this fight, and we're going to finish it.

103
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:40,140
无垠的太空

104
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:40,140
第一季 第四集
By aBu 20170428

105
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:44,120
地球_和_月球
联合国

106
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,050
我们不知道他们在和谁战斗
We can't tell who they're fighting.

107
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,500
有大量雷达干扰
There's massive ladar and radar jamming,

108
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,010
我们没法辨别引擎特征
we can't resolve the drive signatures

109
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,370
也没法通过外形辨别船的身份
or make any visual IDs.

110
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,370
他们抓了我们的人做人质
They took our people hostage.

111
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,200
我们必须派一艘船过去
We have to get a ship there.

112
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,130
奥利诺科号已经尽快往那里赶了
The Orinoco's en route at best possible speed,

113
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,430
但他们还有两天才能到
but they're still two days out.

114
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,540
到时候一切都结束了
It'll all be over by then.

115
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,080
有什么人拥有了一支新的战船舰队
Somebody has a new fleet of warships.

116
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,580
我同意 能猜到有可能是谁吗
I concur. Any idea who it might be?

117
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,410
还没想到 有消息随时通知我
Not yet. Keep me apprised.

118
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,960
我小时候 比人们以为的要聪明
While I was so young, I was wiser than they thought.

119
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,860
"亲爱的" 我说 "惩罚可是死亡"
"Dear, dear," says I, "punishment is death."

120
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,780
"是啊" 他说 "如果他们能抓到我"
"Aye," says he, "if they can get hands on me."

121
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,230
目标15分钟内到达
Incoming targets at 15...

122
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,300
我们加一个显示...
Let's get an additional readout on this...

123
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,250
你看起来有点紧张
You look nervous.

124
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,160
有导弹向我飞来的时候我就会这样
I get that way when missiles are flying at me.

125
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,590
别担心 我们的武器对付得了
Don't worry. It's nothing our guns can't handle.

126
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,900
我猜你在联合国舰队中没见过多少战斗对吗
I take it you didn't see much action in the UN Navy?

127
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,670
-那是好事 -对士兵来说不是
- That was a good thing. - Not for soldiers.

128
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:51,630
我的军官们大多只在模拟演习中见过战斗
The only combat most of my officers have seen is in simulators.

129
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,510
幸运的是 我有机会
Fortunately, I got to spend

130
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,560
在小行星带参与了三年剿灭海盗行动
three years cleansing the belt of pirates

131
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:58,840
扫荡那些抢劫火星星球改造物资的海盗
who were poaching terraforming supplies intended for Mars.

132
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,810
我肯定他们不全是坏人
I'm sure they weren't all bad people.

133
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,510
但有时候必须通过杀戮来保卫生存
But sometimes you have to kill to preserve.

134
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,510
姚舰长 请到2号通讯台
Captain Yao, you're needed on comms deck two.

135
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,430
定点防御炮准备好了吗
PDCs ready?

136
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,480
全阵列已经连线准备好了
All arrays are online and standing by.

137
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,960
外公说你不该到屋顶上来
Appa says you shouldn't be on the roof.

138
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,470
那你就应该吗
And you should?

139
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,360
你不用害怕它们的
They're nothing to be scared of, you know.

140
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,750
他们不过就是些小石头 在天空中燃烧
They're just little rocks that burn up in the sky.

141
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,060
他们并不是都这么小
They're not always so little.

142
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,920
你是说杀死恐龙的那颗吗
You mean like the one that killed the dinosaurs?

143
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,620
好吧 那块石头是很大
Okay, that rock was big.

144
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,620
但那种情况很罕见的
But that hardly ever happens.

145
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,100
比中彩票还难
Like winning the lottery.

146
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,150
我担心的是那些扔石头的人们
I worry about people who throw rocks.

147
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,660
没人能扔得动那么大的石头
Nobody could throw rocks that big.

148
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,680
那只是自然发生的事情 因为重力什么的
It just happens, sometimes, because, you know, gravity.

149
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,010
进来陪我们玩吧
Come in and play.

150
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,950
一会儿我进去送你们上床睡觉
I'll come and put you to bed.

151
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,920
你真没意思
You're no fun.

152
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,740
我能问个问题吗
May I ask you a question?

153
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:38,970
你想念地球吗
Do you miss Earth?

154
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,550
我要是想 就回去了
If I did, I'd go back.

155
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,650
我叔公是从地球移民到火星的
My great-uncle emigrated from Earth.

156
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,160
他特别想念那里
He missed it terribly.

157
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,660
我小时候他经常给我讲故事
He used to tell me stories when I was a little boy

158
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,240
那一望无际的蓝天
about these endless blue skies,

159
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,130
到处都可以自由呼吸
free air everywhere.

160
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,560
广袤的大海直连天际
Open water all the way to the horizon.

161
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,010
他告诉我有一天我们也会把火星建成那样
He told me that someday we would make Mars just like that.

162
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,780
对于一辈子生活在穹顶之下的人而言
When you spend your whole life living under a dome,

163
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:11,560
即使是海洋这样一个概念都难以想象
even the idea of an ocean seems impossible to imagine.

164
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,350
我永远理解不了你们这些人
I could never understand your people.

165
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:20,480
宇宙赐予你们如此丰厚的礼物
Why, when the universe had bestowed so much upon you,

166
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,410
你们为什么却似乎毫不关心
you seemed to care so little for it.

167
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,660
毁灭是地球人最擅长的事情
Wrecking things is what Earthers do best.

168
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,880
火星人也是 从你们战舰的样子看
Martians, too, by the look of your ship.

169
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,330
我们和你们完全不一样
We are nothing like you.

170
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:35,130
地球人关心的只是政府的施舍
The only things Earthers care about is government handouts.

171
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,420
免费食物 免费水 免费毒品
Free food, free water, free drugs

172
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,400
这样你们就可以忘却你们漫无目标的人生
so that you can forget the aimless lives you lead.

173
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,940
你们是一群短视自私的人
You're short-sighted and selfish,

174
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,750
而这会毁了你们
and it will destroy you.

175
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,660
进攻鱼雷进入定点防御炮火力范围 一分钟
Incoming torpedoes in PDC range, one minute.

176
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,120
地球已经完了 霍顿先生
Earth is over, Mr. Holden.

177
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,130
我只希望我们能赶在你们也把火星毁灭之前
My only hope is that we can bring Mars to life

178
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,030
让它焕发生机
before you destroy that, too.

179
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,420
看好犯人
Secure the prisoner.

180
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,580
遵命 长官
Yes, sir.

181
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,110
坐到椅子上去
Get in the chair.

182
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,440
系上
Come on.

183
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,340
希望你喜欢这场表演
I hope you enjoy the show.

184
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:19,290
锁定定点防御炮然后开火
Lock PDCs and engage.

185
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,710
定点防御炮开火
PDCs are go.

186
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,420
毁掉一艘 还剩五艘
Splash one! Five more to go.

187
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,500
有问题吗
Is there a problem?

188
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,280
没有 长官
No, sir,

189
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,860
只是他们的鱼雷导航系统真的很优秀
it's just their torps' guidance systems are really good.

190
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,840
比我们在模拟战斗里见过的都要好
Better than anything we ever simmed against.

191
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,630
让定点防御炮尽全力才能防御
They're pushing our PDCs to the limit.

192
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,970
主反应器舱被击中
Impact on main reactor housing.

193
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:56,580
舰长 敌舰进入制导导弹火力范围
Captain, enemy ships are now inside guided missile range.

194
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,990
鱼雷已经不再有效力了
Torpedoes will no longer be effective.

195
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,520
够了 启动轨道炮
Enough of this. Bring up the rail guns.

196
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,770
我们赶紧结束战斗回家去
Let's finish this and go home.

197
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:03,010
遵命 长官 将能量转移至轨道炮
Aye, sir. Diverting power to rail guns.

198
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:31,030
铭记坎特号

199
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,190
我要找比齐·贝迪克
I'm looking for Bizi Betiko.

200
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,780
你在这里可找不到他
You're not going to find him here.

201
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,610
为什么这么说
Why you pensa?

202
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,410
你为什么这么说
Why you pensa?

203
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,340
-为什么这么说 -你为什么这么说
- Why you pensa? - Why you pensa?

204
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:51,600
-这是他家 是吗 -对 是的
- This is his place, right? - So, ya, that it is.

205
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,610
这就意味着我已经驾驶普拉号
Which puts me at 29 days,

206
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,130
在无动力下飞行了
seven hours and 13 minutes of Pura,

207
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,930
29天7小时13分了
unpowered flight.

208
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:37,180
我会绕木星转向 然后高速...
I carve it up around the big-gas, then load up more spin...

209
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,800
-罗曼诺夫 -绕过土星环
- Romanov. - Going 'round the ringer.

210
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:43,490
还有三百万公里的绝对真空
It's only three million clicks of hard vacuum

211
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,600
我就要冲向比蚊子屁股还小的靶心了
to hit a bull's-eye smaller than a mosquito's ass

212
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,750
然后就可以让我永载飞行史册
and fly my way into the record books.

213
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,770
引力弹弓俱乐部
Slingshot club.

214
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:58,300
是的 只是娱乐大众 长官
Yeah. Oh, for entertainment purposes only, sasa ke.

215
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,650
不需要执照的
No license required.

216
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,840
我根本不关心什么狗屁执照
Ah, I don't give a crap about that. Huh?

217
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,510
那想要赌一把吗 今晚这一出很不错哦
Wanna bet, ke? Action good tonight.

218
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:09,670
好了 都听我说 我是恒星螺旋警察
All right, listen up! Star Helix.

219
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,240
我在找一个女孩
I'm looking for a girl.

220
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,230
她叫朱莉 曾经是个驾驶员
Her name's Julie, she was a pilot.

221
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,240
她可能来找比齐租过一艘船
She might've come to Bizi to charter a ship?

222
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,790
这边
Here.

223
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,330
混蛋们 比齐·贝迪克死了
Hey, assholes. Bizi Betiko is dead.

224
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:34,840
他还没死呢 笨警察 他在那里
He ain't dead yet, copeng. He be out there.

225
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,870
那就是比齐·贝迪克
That Bizi Betiko!

226
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,410
看好我是怎么成功的...
Watch the way it's done...

227
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,630
贝迪克
比齐
谷神星
12区42层
男性

228
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,110
胜利
Sabaka!

229
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:10,150
比齐 比齐 比齐 比齐
Bizi, Bizi, Bizi, Bizi!

230
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,570
加油 加油
Come on, come on, come on.

231
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,400
加油啊 加油啊
Come on, come on, come on.

232
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,550
加油 加油
Come on, come on, come on.

233
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,020
现在他死了
Now he dead.

234
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:29,290
你应该赌的 你真该赌一把的
Should've bet. Should've bet.

235
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,490
第谷_空间站
位于小行星带

236
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,420
诺伍号的引擎都已经通过了检测和认证
The Nauvoo's engines have all been tested and certified,

237
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,270
我们同时
and we've been able to

238
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,990
还在继续完成船体外壳的建造
continue laying down the hull at the same time.

239
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:48,110
也就是说 一切都在按计划进行
Which means, everything is proceeding on schedule

240
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:51,220
也在预算之内 我相信你听到一定会很高兴
and on budget, which I'm sure you're pleased to hear.

241
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,440
约翰逊先生
Mr. Johnson.

242
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,950
后期圣徒教会雇你来建造诺伍号
The Latter Day Saints took a considerable risk

243
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,930
是冒了一定风险的
hiring you to build the Nauvoo.

244
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,770
我知道
I know.

245
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,180
第谷公司主营加速行星自转
Tycho spins up asteroids.

246
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,600
我们并没有造船业务 以前没有过
We don't build ships, not till now.

247
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,830
但相信我 这会成为一艘令世人难忘的船
But trust me, it'll be a ship no one will ever forget.

248
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,180
我不是这个意思
That's not what I meant.

249
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,610
我是指你 有些人在讨论
I meant you. There have been rumblings

250
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:15,010
应该把这个项目的主管
that you should be replaced

251
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:17,110
换成别人
as head of operations for the project.

252
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,460
为什么呢
Why is that?

253
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,190
你与外行星联盟的关系
Your ties to the OPA have been making a number of elders

254
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,350
让总会的一些长老们感到不安
in the general authorities uncomfortable,

255
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,620
尤其考虑到最近小行星带发生的事件
Particularly in light of the recent events in the belt.

256
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:38,200
外行星联盟旨在为全体小行星带人
The OPA is only interested in human rights

257
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,620
争取人权和工作
and jobs for all Belters.

258
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,600
还有在谷神星上挑起骚乱
And fomenting riots on Ceres.

259
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,160
还有利用坎特伯雷号事件煽动民众情绪
And inflaming passions in the wake of the Canterbury.

260
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,900
有组织宗教在历史上也不是没有过血腥暴力
The history of organized religion isn't exactly strife-free.

261
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:54,240
教会指示我向第谷公司要求一位新的项目主管
I've been asked to request a new head of operations.

262
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,040
当然 如果你们希望这样
Of course. If that's what you want.

263
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:02,070
但我有义务提醒你 没有我
But I'd be remiss if I didn't remind you that, without me,

264
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,130
你们可能很难找到技能最娴熟的小行星带人
you're going to have a very difficult time retaining

265
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,230
来建设你们的项目
the most skilled Belters for your project.

266
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,590
我是指那些真正认真负责的人
I mean the ones who build for reliability.

267
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:14,170
你们要派你们最优秀最聪明的摩门教徒
You're about to send your best and brightest Mormons

268
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:16,310
登上一场长达百年的旅程
on a hundred-year voyage

269
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,620
去往一个新太阳系的新行星
to a new world around a new sun.

270
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,770
谁知道路上有可能发生什么样的悲剧故障呢
Who knows what tragic malfunctions might occur along the way?

271
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,670
那么你打算找谁来替换我
So who'd you have in mind?

272
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,470
我们还在权衡考虑中
We're still weighing our options.

273
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:41,220
目前还请先一切照旧
For now, uh, please just continue along, as before.

274
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,980
太好了
Great.

275
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,490
我们要对诺伍号的传感器阵列
We have some calibration work to do

276
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:50,030
进行校准
on the Nauvoo's sensor arrays.

277
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,670
所以我要请你们的人先都下船
So I'm going to need you to get all your people off the ship

278
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,740
等我们完工了会通知你的
and I'll let you know when we're done.

279
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,960
可以行动了
We're good to go.

280
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,970
把所有的摩门教徒都赶下船
Get all the Mormons off the ship

281
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,940
将所有的传感器都对准唐纳吉尔号
and get those sensors pointed toward the Donnager.

282
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,950
我需要全面情报 快
I need a full report, now.

283
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,330
他们也有轨道炮
They've got rail guns, too.

284
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,210
我还从没见过这种大小的船上带轨道炮
I've never seen them on ships this size.

285
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,060
见鬼 我觉得他们在把能量转移到轨道炮
Shit. I think they're diverting power to the rail guns.

286
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,840
那就意味着我们进入近战状态了
That means we're in CQB.

287
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,920
-什么是近战 -域内近距离战斗
- What the hell is CQB? - A close quarter battle.

288
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:08,370
谁会疯狂到和唐纳吉尔号进行近战
Who would be insane enough to take on the Donnager in CQB?

289
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,370
该死 把我从这椅子上解开
God damn it, let me out of this chair!

290
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,740
我没必要在这里 让我回去和我的人在一起
I don't need to be here. Put me back with my people.

291
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,810
让他闭嘴或堵住他的嘴
Keep him quiet or gag him.

292
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,160
我需要知道这些船的身份
I want IDs.

293
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,440
我们得知道他们的作战能力
We need to know their capabilities.

294
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,580
抱歉 长官 火星舰队和联合国都找不到
I'm sorry, sir, but there's nothing matching their profile

295
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,090
和他们外形吻合的记录
in MCRN or UN records.

296
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:23,480
把各艘船的图像单独隔离出来
Isolate each vessel.

297
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:24,530
我要每艘船的
I want detailed imagery

298
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:26,480
详细图像和引擎特征数据
and drive signatures on every one of them.

299
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,020
舰长请到DC4区
Captain to DC-4.

300
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,610
我见过这样的船
I've seen a ship like that before.

301
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,630
第三艘和第四艘已摧毁
Splash three and four!

302
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,540
上尉 主引擎超载
Lieutenant, the main drive is overloading.

303
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,010
我们得把它关掉
We have to shut it down.

304
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,670
伙计们
Uh, guys...

305
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,850
-引擎关掉了 -好啊
- the drive's out. - Good.

306
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,680
不 这一点都不好
No, this ain't good at all.

307
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,540
作为一个凶狠的火星舰队小丑
You know, for a badass mickie navy boy,

308
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,750
你可真是个爱抱怨的小姑娘
you're a pretty whiny little bitch.

309
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,600
我只是个运输机驾驶员 你个野蛮人懂吗
I was just a transport pilot, you yahoo! You understand?

310
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,210
我从没受过这种情况的训练
I wasn't trained for this shit!

311
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,610
我只是个名字好听点的公车司机 满意了吧
I was a glorified bus driver, okay? You satisfied?

312
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,170
天啊 不应该发生这种事的
Oh, man, this is not supposed to be happening.

313
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,280
-亚历克斯 -不要 不要
- Shh, hey, Alex. - No, no, no, no, no, no!

314
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:17,500
看我这里有什么
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Look what I got.

315
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,640
一切都会好起来的 好吗
Everything's going to be okay, okay?

316
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,710
这会让你冷静下来
This is going to calm you right down.

317
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,650
相信我 我们不会有事...
Trust me, we're all going to be just...

318
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,240
我们得把洞堵住
We need to plug the holes!

319
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,210
一号轨道炮毁损 主警告灯开启
Rail gun one is down, master caution is lit.

320
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:46,010
有人受伤 医护人员到指挥中心
Man down! Medics to CIC.

321
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:55,260
你说你之前见过这艘船
You said you've seen this ship before.

322
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,560
有一艘和炸毁坎特伯雷号的船一模一样
One just like it blew up the Canterbury.

323
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:02,180
请安保人员检查船体
Can we get security to the hull, please.

324
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:03,650
他们停火了 为什么
They stopped firing. Why?

325
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:05,450
确认船体大面积受损
Confirm massive hull damage.

326
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,560
入侵舱在甲板着陆 我们被登舰了
Breaching pods on deck. We're being boarded.

327
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,730
舰长 这人有话和您说
Captain, this man has something to tell you.

328
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:22,620
现在不行 上尉
Not now, lieutenant.

329
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:23,420
你们正在对付的船
The ships you're fighting are

330
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,420
和炸毁坎特伯雷号的船一样
just like the ones that blew up the Canterbury.

331
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,150
不管是谁干的
Whoever's responsible for

332
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:30,250
他们想把这一切都怪到火星头上
this is trying to frame Mars for everything.

333
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:37,870
洛佩兹 把霍顿先生安全带离这艘船
Lopez, I want you to get Mr. Holden off of this ship

334
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,010
送回火星舰队指挥部
and safely back to MCRN command.

335
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:42,870
他是唯一能直接为这件事作证的人
He's the only person who can directly testify to this.

336
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,490
明白 长官 带他走
Understood, sir. Take him.

337
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:47,820
等等 没有我的船员我哪里都不会去
Hold on. I'm not going anywhere without my shipmates.

338
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,350
给他穿上太空服
Get him in his suit!

339
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,490
确保让这个和他一起离开
Make sure you get this off with him.

340
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,630
刚才空气从房间两边的洞里往外跑
The air rushed out of holes on both sides of the room,

341
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,610
这就意味着我们周围全是真空
Which means we're surrounded by a hard vacuum.

342
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,780
我们被困住了
We're trapped.

343
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,710
或许...或许我们可以强行打开这扇门
Maybe... maybe we can force the door.

344
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,810
-火星的密封门非常牢固 你知道的
- Mars builds too well, you know that.

345
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:22,720
就算打开我们也得完蛋 我们没有太空服
We'd still be screwed because we don't have our pressure suits.

346
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,160
大气循环系统还坏着
Atmosphere systems are still out.

347
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,930
我估计我们还剩大约20分钟的空气
I figure we have maybe 20 minutes of air left.

348
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:30,110
糟透了
Crap!

349
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,180
你在干什么
What're you doing?

350
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:36,330
镇静剂
Sedative.

351
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,340
这里面的量足够镇静我们中的一个
There's enough here to take one of us out,

352
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,730
延缓这个人的呼吸
which will slow down their breathing

353
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,510
减少我们的氧气消耗
and cut down our oxygen use.

354
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:44,200
-或许能多争取一点时间 -做什么的时间
- Maybe buy us a little more extra time. - For what?

355
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,540
你以为会有人来救我们吗
You think someone's going to come and get us?

356
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,420
我们没有通讯器 没法求救
We don't have comms, we can't call for help.

357
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,850
你有更好的计划吗
Do you got a better plan?

358
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,650
这是我的主意 我来
It's my idea. I'll take the shot.

359
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:52,710
不行 我们需要你保持清醒
No! We need you conscious.

360
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,510
他是地球人 他用的氧气最多 该让他来
He's an Earther, he uses the most air. He should do it!

361
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,740
我能背得动你 你背不动我
I can carry you. You can't carry me.

362
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,610
该死
Damn it.

363
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,740
我希望能醒过来
I wanna wake up.

364
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:07,980
我想谢谢你
I want to say thank you.

365
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,080
你明白的
You know,

366
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:15,100
为你一直以来对我的帮助
for helping me all those times you did.

367
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,750
你是个好人
You're a good person.

368
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,780
我本可以做个更好的人的
I could've been better.

369
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,870
我都没来得及说再见
I didn't even get to say goodbye.

370
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,500
对谁说
To who?

371
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,520
不重要了
It doesn't matter.

372
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,680
你知道最让我郁闷的是什么吗
You know what really chaps my ass?

373
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,830
我的船在受攻击 我的弟兄们在死去
The fact that I'm here protecting some lousy Earth taker

374
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,910
而我却在这里
while my ship's getting pounded

375
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:14,870
保护一个恶心的地球无赖
and my buddies are dying.

376
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:17,710
那你为什么不去帮他们 让我去帮我的人
Then why don't you go help them and let me go help mine.

377
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,490
我们有命令在身 在火星上职责是有意义的
We have our orders. Duty means something on Mars.

378
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,100
我倒很高兴让你走
I'd be happy to let you go.

379
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,280
我听说土卫九的事是你和你的朋友们干的
I heard you and your friends were responsible for Phoebe.

380
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,040
我对土卫九一无所知 你怎么不干脆问他
I know nothing about Phoebe. Why don't you just ask him?

381
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,300
后撤寻找掩护
Fall back and cover!

382
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,040
霍顿 后撤躲在我们身后 蹲下
Holden! Get back and stay back! And stay down!

383
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,980
霍顿 停下 见鬼 霍顿 回来
Holden, stop! God damn it, Holden! Get back here!

384
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,800
好了 我来了 什么事情重要到
Okay, I'm here. What's so important that I had to drop everything

385
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,930
让我放下手头的一切跑来这个破洞
and come to this hell hole?

386
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:21,840
认识这家伙吗
Recognize this guy?

387
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,740
认识 你在广场上找到的尸体
Yeah. The stiff you found in the square.

388
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,490
-我听说是起谋杀 -看看这个
- I heard it was a murder. - Look at this.

389
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,660
好棒 你查出他的身份了 工作就该这样
Great, you found his ID. That's how it's supposed to work.

390
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,380
这不是他 看到了吗
It's not him, see.

391
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:35,040
每次我扫描这家伙 都出来一个不同的身份
Every time I sample the guy, I get a different ID comes up

392
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,950
约翰
亨特
地球
12区42层
男性

393
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,350
相貌看起来都吻合
with a face that looks like it could be a match.

394
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,620
杰里米
吉斯派尔
火星
12区42层
男性

395
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,460
这尸体有很多体内植入物
Your stiff's got a lot of implants.

396
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,530
我猜他有个身份欺骗设备模块
I bet he has an ID spoofer mod.

397
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,600
专门设计来弄晕警察们
They're designed to spin cops,

398
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,100
让他们浪费时间追查错误的线索
waste their time chasing down false leads.

399
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,090
用这种东西的只有骗子们
The only guys who really use them are crooks.

400
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,590
成功的骗子们 这东西可不便宜
Successful ones. They're not cheap.

401
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:52,310
这些高科技的东西你一向比我强多了
You are way more of a gear-head than I ever was.

402
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,070
能帮我查出他的身份吗
Can you help me ID him?

403
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,460
米勒 你有一个搭档来帮你做这些事
Miller, you have a partner for this kind of stuff.

404
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,900
我试过给哈弗洛克打电话 他不希望被人找
No, I tried Havelock, he didn't want to be found.

405
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,610
我有时候也会这样
I've done the same from time to time.

406
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,500
求你了
Please?

407
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,250
好吧
Well,

408
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,080
如果他有欺骗设备
if he has a spoofer,

409
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,680
那他体内很可能还有一大堆违法的东西
then he's probably got a bunch of other shady shit in him.

410
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,310

00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,910
他腿里藏了一个存储块
He's got a memory crypt in his calf.

416
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,310
我们把它拿出来
Let's take it out.

417
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:31,080
-我去叫法医 -不要
- I'll get the coroner. - No.

418
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,770
那家伙话太多了
That guy talks too much.

419
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,750
来吧
Here we go.

420
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:46,770
寻找目标中

421
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:48,320
未抓取成功

422
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,950
寻找目标中

423
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,880
见鬼
Damn it.

424
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:11,230
我又不会弄疼他
Well, it's not like I'm hurting the guy.

425
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,890
寻找目标中

426
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,430
抓取成功

427
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,380
找到了
There.

428
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,630
成功
Bingo.

429
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,250
内容被加密了 当然
Content's encrypted, obviously.

430
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,820
不过从文件名上看 应该是政府记录
But judging by the file names, these are government records.

431
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,720
好吧
Okay.

432
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,270
客户档案 公司研发...
Customs documents, corporate R&D...

433
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,720
这家伙是个数据倒卖贩
This guy was a data broker.

434
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,900
不管他倒卖了什么
Well, whatever he brokered,

435
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,500
一定足够重要到害他丧命的地步
must have been important enough to get him killed.

436
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,350
-你有什么事没告诉我 -没有
- What're you not telling me? - Nothing.

437
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,750
米勒
Miller.

438
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,330
你不知道比较好
It's better if you don't know.

439
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,390
我不需要你来保护我
I don't need you to protect me.

440
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,730
我没有保护你
I'm not protecting you.

441
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,930
我讨厌你这样做
I... I hate it when you do this.

442
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,840
谢谢了
Thanks.

443
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,310
哈弗洛克
Havelock.

444
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,350
接电话啊
Come on.

445
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,090
好吧 给他留言
All right. Leave him a message.

446
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,880
听着
Hey, look, um...

447
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,720
我不管你在干什么或者在干谁
I don't care if you're up to your whatever in whoever,

448
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,880
等你上来歇口气的时候
but when you come up for air,

449
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,120
我需要你帮我在沙迪那里打个掩护 好吗
I'm gonna need you to cover for me with Shaddid, okay?

450
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,780
我没法跟你说细节
I can't give you any details,

451
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:40,840
你自己想象一下吧 好吗
but just use your imagination, all right?

452
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:43,530
我知道只要你想 你很会做个卑鄙小人的
I know you can be a devious son of a bitch when you want to be.

453
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,590
我也会为你做同样的事的
I'd do the same for you.

454
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:59,690
天啊 天啊 我去叫人帮忙
Oh shit! Shit! I'll get help!

455
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:02,940
来人救命啊 有一位警官需要帮助
Somebody help! This officer needs help!

456
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:05,520
救命
Help me!

457
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:17,020
放手 别逼我杀你
Let go. Don't make me shoot you.

458
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,400
你不会的
You won't.

459
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,570
他的武器被盔甲锁定了 开不了枪的
His weapon is keyed to his armor, he couldn't have fired it.

460
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:34,560
不用客气
You're welcome.

461
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,590
莫尔死了 混蛋
Mole's dead, asshole.

462
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:44,700
对不起 真的很对不起 但除非你帮我
I'm sorry, I really am. But I won't testify to anything

463
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:47,260
把我的朋友也带离这艘船 否则我不会作证
unless you help me get my friends off this ship.

464
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:50,180
-闭嘴 我想对他问话 -遵命 长官
- Shut up. I want to speak to him. - Yes, sir.

465
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:53,780
他看起来可不像我见过的那些外行星联盟大兵
He doesn't look like any OPA grunt I've ever seen.

466
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,100
这技术比他们先进多了
Tech is way too advanced.

467
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,480
他是你的了
Yours.

468
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,880
你为谁工作 你们为什么要毁掉坎特伯雷号
Who are you working for? Why did you destroy the canterbury?

469
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,600
土卫九空间站 你在场吗
Phoebe Station. Were you there?

470
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:12,290
你在场 发生了什么事
You were. What happened?

471
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:14,560
认真听好了
Listen to me very carefully.

472
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,850
如果你想要医护人员来看你 就赶快交代
If you want medical attention, you start speaking now.

473
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,190
我们很快都会死了
We'll all be dead soon enough.

474
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,240
-走吧 -拜托了
- Let's go. - Please.

475
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,400
你得帮我去救我的朋友们
You have to help me get my friends.

476
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,880
你也不会把自己人抛下不管的
You wouldn't leave one of yours behind.

477
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,910
我们是火星军人
We're Marines.

478
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:35,420
我们发誓在必要的时候为他人牺牲
We've sworn to die for each other if we have to.

479
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,340
你都几乎不怎么了解他们
You barely know those other people.

480
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:39,220
他们在这里完全是因为我
They're only here because of me.

481
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,240
我和你作笔交易
I'll make you a deal.

482
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,600
谢德
Oh, Shed.

483
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,170
你没事吧
Hey, are you okay?

484
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:11,150
你回来了
You came back?

485
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:12,910
当然
Of course I did.

486
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:14,140
交易是这样的
The deal is this.

487
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,410
你们都要公开作证说火星
You will all testify that Mars had nothing to do

488
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:19,290
与坎特伯雷号的毁灭无关
with the Canterbury's destruction.

489
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:22,010
快穿好太空服 气封只是暂时性的
Suit up fast, the air seal is temporary.

490
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:23,100
我们得快走
We have to move.

491
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,910
-亚历克斯怎么了 -他替大家挨了一针
- What's wrong with Alex? - He took one for the team.

492
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,570
我来背他
I'll carry him.

493
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:37,370
来 伙计 穿上太空服
Come on, buddy. We gotta suit up.

494
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,710
我们不能再被阻拦了
We can't get pinned down again,

495
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,650
我们得找到一条安全通往停机坪的路
we need a clear route to the hangar bay.

496
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:48,310
我在努力 长官 但船上到处都是敌人
I'm trying, sir, but our ship is crawling with scumbags.

497
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:49,690
洛佩兹
Lopez.

498
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:53,060
听我说
Listen.

499
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:55,320
我们都失去了我们在乎的人
We've all lost people we care about.

500
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,460
而且我对整件事情一头雾水
And I don't even have a clue as to why.

501
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:59,480
但我不停地听到你们说起土卫九空间站
But I keep hearing about Phoebe Station.

502
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:01,110
如果我们都要因为它死去
And if we're all going to die because of it,

503
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:03,580
你能至少告诉我那里到底发生了什么事吗
can't you at least tell me what the hell happened there?

504
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,930
土卫九空间站失去联系好几周
Donnager was dispatched to Phoebe Station

505
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:09,050
唐纳吉尔号被派去查看
after she went silent for several weeks.

506
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:10,720
为什么
Why?

507
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,830
我们至今还是不知道
We still don't know.

508
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:16,950
上面所有人都死了 他们的尸体被烧成灰烬
Everyone on board was dead. Their bodies were incinerated.

509
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:19,650
我们找到他们被重新冻入冰道的墙里
We found them re-frozen to the walls of the ice tunnels.

510
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:21,350
我们以为是发生了火灾或者化学品泄露
We thought it was a fire or a chemical spill,

511
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:24,530
但随后我们发现所有的电脑核心都被摧毁了
but then we discovered that all the computer cores were destroyed.

512
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,490
你是说有人故意干的吗
You mean someone did it deliberately?

513
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,950
他们在掩盖什么事情
They were covering something up.

514
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:32,200
-什么事 -我不知道
- Like what? - I don't know.

515
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,670
老天
Jesus.

516
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,640
出什么事了
What happened?

517
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,350
舰长启动了零号程序
The Captain has set Condition Zero.

518
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:48,620
她要炸掉这艘船
She's going to scuttle the ship.

519
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,660
船体受损 四号甲板 情况紧急
Hull breach, deck four, critical.

520
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,980
登舰者正往工程仓 助动舱
Boarders are converging on engineering, aux,

521
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:03,130
零号程序显示

522
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,630
指挥中心和舰桥集结
CIC and the bridge.

523
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,220
准备好的备用舰离开停机坪了吗
Has the ready standby left the hangar bay?

524
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,830
没有 长官 还在那里
Negative, sir. It's still there.

525
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:17,820
-舰长 -还不到时候
- Captain. - Not yet.

526
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:20,750
这必须值些什么
This has to count for something.

527
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:28,990
杜基已就位
Dookie ready.

528
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:30,360
格兰姆斯已就位
Grimes in position.

529
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:44,030
把磁力靴关掉 尽快冲过去
Mag boots off. Move as fast as you can.

530
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:48,970
所有人听我口令 等待掩护火力
Everybody on my mark. Standby for cover fire.

531
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,690
你可不许在我面前倒下
Hey, hey! Don't you quit on me.

532
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,280
好了
All right.

533
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,130
准备好了吗
Ready?

534
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,170
跑
Go!

535
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,590
快跑
Go!

536
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,670
我们现在该怎么办
What the hell are we supposed to do now?

537
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,380
其他人呢
What about the others?

538
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:54,210
都死了 我们得赶紧离开
They're gone. We have to dust off now.

539
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:12,560
我不是飞行员 你得找别人来驾驶这艘船
I'm not a pilot. Someone else needs to fly.

540
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,870
-怎么了 -上去
- What? Whoa! - Go. Go!

541
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,690
将全船所有系统的操作控制权限
Authorize full operational

542
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:30,240
授权给现在船上的所有人
control of all systems for everyone now on board.
