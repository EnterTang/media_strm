00:00:21,528 --> 00:00:24,320
Hey!
Sweet sixteen!

2
00:00:24,503 --> 00:00:26,376
That’s right!
Is my birthday!

3
00:00:26,377 --> 00:00:28,510
Arms are better,
got my cast off too...

4
00:00:29,676 --> 00:00:31,928
And it’s snowing...!
Cool!

5
00:00:32,271 --> 00:00:33,658
This is gonna be a good day.

6
00:00:36,914 --> 00:00:38,408
Happy Birthday, Wally.

7
00:00:38,653 --> 00:00:40,220
Oh, my favorite breakfast!

8
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,276
Heaping piles of everything!

9
00:00:42,855 --> 00:00:44,046
Thanks, Mom.

10
00:00:47,556 --> 00:00:48,950
You know,
if you ever come up for air,

11
00:00:48,951 --> 00:00:52,402
I can take you to the DMV to get
your driver’s license after school.

12
00:00:52,743 --> 00:00:54,313
This weather would be
a good proving ground.

13
00:00:56,691 --> 00:00:58,966
Not really in a big rush
to drive, Dad.

14
00:00:58,967 --> 00:01:01,448
‘Cause... you know.
I’m me.

15
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:03,831
You certainly are.

16
00:01:03,955 --> 00:01:06,266
Plus, the team’s throwing me
a big surprise-party

17
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:07,468
this afternoon, at the Cave.

18
00:01:08,397 --> 00:01:12,815
In school today, ask your teacher
the definition of “surprise”.

19
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,883
You want “surprise”,
just watch Miss Martian’s expression

20
00:01:15,884 --> 00:01:18,696
when I collect my birthday kiss.

21
00:01:20,451 --> 00:01:23,541
Well, I have a surprise for you.
Or, at least, your aunt Iris does.

22
00:01:23,721 --> 00:01:25,793
<i>And a special shout out
to my nephew Wally,</i>

23
00:01:25,901 --> 00:01:28,751
<i>wishing him a very happy
sixteenth birthday.</i>

24
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:30,049
So cool!

25
00:01:30,088 --> 00:01:31,328
<i>Now, for school closures.</i>

26
00:01:31,412 --> 00:01:34,122
<i>The following schools
have declared today a snow day:</i>

27
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:38,518
<i>Dubuc Elementary, Spisak Junior High,
Central City High, Keystone High...</i>

28
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:40,007
Oh, yes!

29
00:01:40,121 --> 00:01:43,010
<i>Could life get any sweeter?</i>

What...?
Oh, you guys, you shouldn’t have...

39

Right, not like you’ve been hinting
for days, or anything.

40
00:02:54,577 --> 00:02:57,504
- I made two cakes.
- Awesome! What will you, guys, eat?

41
00:02:57,534 --> 00:02:58,860
We’ll split the cupcake.

42

- Make a wish!
- Way ahead of you...

43

You know... If I tell you my wish,
it won’t come true.

44
00:03:11,254 --> 00:03:12,771
But, if you guess...

45
00:03:13,774 --> 00:03:15,445
Nope!
Guess again!

Oh, yeah.
Just “like home”.

Some day...

You’ll get used

Think we should tell him?

54

I can make you warmer still.

Well, can’t the Watchtower blow them
out of the sky, or something?

69
00:04:34,927 --> 00:04:36,466
What’s a “Watchtower”?

70

<i>The League’s orbiting Headquarters

Someone ordered a pizza?

00:06:54,133 --> 00:06:56,032
What you’re delivering

to a girl who’s life depends on it.

Duh! I meant if anyone

So no crumpling.
Got it.

<i>I’m at max speed now,
but if I push it,</i>

<i>maybe I can dump this load, save the girl
and still join the real action!</i>

125
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:22,142
<i>Aw, come on! Robin and Aqualad,
with Batman, Aquaman and Flash?</i>

<i>Aw, man!</i>

129
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:41,318
<i> I’d give this arm

He’s due to pass here any minute.

132
00:08:56,179 --> 00:08:57,338
Lovely...

133
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:02,464
Now all I have to do
is get his attention.

134
00:09:02,934 --> 00:09:04,434
Any ideas?

135
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:22,841
<i>Who is THAT?</i>

136
00:09:22,885 --> 00:09:24,050
<i>WHO is that?</i>

137
00:09:30,714 --> 00:09:31,826
<i>It’s him!</i>

138
00:09:38,108 --> 00:09:40,741
Go! Get outta here!
I’ll handle Vandal.

139
00:09:41,016 --> 00:09:42,554
“You’ll handle” me?

140
00:09:45,276 --> 00:09:46,670
Little hero...

141
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,079
Do you really think you have
what it takes to survive...

142
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,126
...Vandal Savage?

143
00:10:11,692 --> 00:10:13,868
<i>This guy is so going down...</i>

144
00:10:13,976 --> 00:10:17,707
When I heard authorities were cordoning off
this highway for a speeds trap,

145
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:20,940
I assumed I’d be confronting
Flash himself.

146
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:23,030
He and I are due for a reckoning.

147
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,535
But I suppose I must settle
for making him miserable,

148
00:10:26,536 --> 00:10:29,553
by killing his brat sidekick,
instead.

149
00:10:31,485 --> 00:10:33,922
<i>Troopers are safely out of range...
Good.</i>

150
00:10:34,281 --> 00:10:37,715
<i>Frees me up to show Savage
just what a “brat sidekick” can do.</i>

151
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,060
<i>Kinda bashing my head
into a brick wall here.</i>

152
00:11:14,226 --> 00:11:15,622
<i>Need a new approach.</i>

153
00:11:19,242 --> 00:11:22,247
Well, you’re truly running circles
around me.

154
00:11:22,576 --> 00:11:24,130
How will I cope?

155
00:11:29,249 --> 00:11:31,304
<i>Not “coping” so great now,
is he?</i>

156
00:11:32,774 --> 00:11:34,044
<i>What am I doing?</i>

157
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,299
<i>Sure, I’d love to finish trashing this
big jerk, but that won’t save the girl.</i>

158
00:11:45,313 --> 00:11:46,890
It should suffice.

159
00:11:52,614 --> 00:11:56,792
<i>Wasted about 15 minutes on Savage,
but I can still reach Seattle on time.</i>

160
00:11:59,013 --> 00:12:00,590
<i>Great,
out of snacks.</i>

161
00:12:00,609 --> 00:12:02,733
<i>Dude, you’re so
running on fuel right now!</i>

162
00:12:02,766 --> 00:12:04,251
<i>But that wouldn’t help the girl either.</i>

163
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,778
<i>But forget the hunger, forget
the freezing temp, forget the windchill…</i>

164
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,727
<i>Just go!
Go!</i>

165
00:12:50,688 --> 00:12:51,824
Kid Flash!

166
00:12:52,408 --> 00:12:54,342
I made it!
I’m here!

167
00:12:55,163 --> 00:12:57,218
I’m… I’m sorry.

168
00:12:57,394 --> 00:12:58,539
You’re too late.

169
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:04,669
No! No, look, I’ve got
almost twenty minutes to spare!

170
00:13:05,257 --> 00:13:09,225
I know...
But she passed away 12 minutes ago.

171
00:13:10,012 --> 00:13:11,983
Twelve...?
12 minutes?

172
00:13:12,673 --> 00:13:14,773
Please...
Don’t blame yourself.

173
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:17,497
I’m sure you got here
as fast as you could.

174
00:13:30,706 --> 00:13:33,793
<i>12 minutes...
The fight took 15...</i>

175
00:13:34,077 --> 00:13:36,435
Maybe another recipient
can be found...

176
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,343
<i>Superman, Captain Marvel and Doctor Fate
brought down the fourth Ice Fortress.</i>

177
00:13:57,842 --> 00:14:00,999
Kid Flash! We’ve been waiting for you!
Where is the Queen’s heart?

178
00:14:01,213 --> 00:14:03,708
Wait, the girl’s dead, so now
the heart’s going to a queen?

179
00:14:04,006 --> 00:14:05,316
The girl IS the Queen!

180
00:14:05,317 --> 00:14:07,801
Queen Perdita of Vlatava,
age ten.

181
00:14:08,121 --> 00:14:10,171
And she’s not dead,
but she IS running out of time.

182
00:14:11,214 --> 00:14:12,503
<i>I’ve been conned!</i>

183
00:14:17,572 --> 00:14:18,807
<i>No!</i>

184
00:14:33,553 --> 00:14:35,584
<i>I’d love to take these creeps out,</i>

185
00:14:35,585 --> 00:14:36,877
<i>but can’t put the heart at risk.</i>

186
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:38,173
<i>Again.</i>

187
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,276
<i>They’re blocking the stairs,
so...</i>

188
00:14:45,866 --> 00:14:47,263
<i>We’ll take the highroad!</i>

189
00:14:52,488 --> 00:14:54,777
<i>That was nauseatingly familiar...</i>

190
00:14:55,001 --> 00:14:56,201
<i>Count Vertigo...</i>

191
00:14:57,366 --> 00:14:58,926
<i>Now it all makes sense.</i>

192
00:14:59,021 --> 00:15:02,426
<i>Queen Perdita stands between
her uncle Vertigo and the Vlatavan Crown!</i>

193
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:13,746
Crawling away…
Is the young hero reduced to that?

194
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:17,227
- Hey, I’m not proud.
- Apparently.

195
00:15:17,267 --> 00:15:18,660
<i>But not defeated either!</i>

196
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,822
<i>Not while I still have
one weapon left!</i>

197
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,565
<i>My big mouth!</i>

198
00:15:22,747 --> 00:15:24,084
I don’t get it, Vertigo!

199
00:15:24,502 --> 00:15:27,539
You were defeated,
with the rest of the Injustice League.

200
00:15:27,797 --> 00:15:30,990
How come you’re not in Belle Reve prison,
with your putrid pals?

201
00:15:31,547 --> 00:15:37,052
As a member of the Vlatavan Royal Family,
I have “immunité diplomatique”.

202
00:15:37,211 --> 00:15:41,381
As long as no crimes against Vlatava
can be proven against me.

203
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:46,256
But when the Queen needed a heart,
Count Heartless heard opportunity knock!

204
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:49,628
The Ice Fortresses were all part
of the plan to murder your niece!

205
00:15:50,156 --> 00:15:53,545
And Savage, he intentionally stole me,
as a favor to you!

206
00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:56,916
It is nice to have friends...

207
00:15:57,371 --> 00:16:01,868
Now, shall we see if I can kill
two hearts with one blow...?

208
00:16:02,248 --> 00:16:03,842
Take your best shot...

209
00:16:10,005 --> 00:16:11,149
Yes!

210
00:16:13,137 --> 00:16:14,318
Enough!

211
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:23,818
‘D love to continue
this love fest, Count...

212
00:16:24,503 --> 00:16:26,558
But you’re not my priority.

213
00:16:29,753 --> 00:16:31,287
<i>Tell me there’s still time...</i>

214
00:16:35,776 --> 00:16:37,091
Take it! Go!

215
00:16:38,158 --> 00:16:41,029
Right, right...
Send word to all our team staff!

216
00:16:55,467 --> 00:16:57,966
Wally’s birthday dinner
will be completely dried out.

217
00:16:58,152 --> 00:16:59,327
Shh! Mary!

218
00:16:59,428 --> 00:17:02,236
<i>Hawkman, Hawkwoman, Captain Atom
and Wonder Woman have defeated</i>

219
00:17:02,237 --> 00:17:03,845
<i>a fifth flying Ice Fortress.</i>

220
00:17:04,668 --> 00:17:06,185
<i>But this just in...</i>

221
00:17:06,501 --> 00:17:10,386
<i>Despite the best efforts of  Kid Flash
and the team of transplant surgeons,</i>

222
00:17:10,652 --> 00:17:12,895
<i>young Queen Perdita of Vlatava
died.</i>

223
00:17:13,076 --> 00:17:15,987
<i>On the operating table,
at Seattle Medical Center.</i>

224
00:17:26,451 --> 00:17:27,699
Count Vertigo...

225
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:31,042
That’s “King Vertigo” to you,
peasant...

226
00:17:31,414 --> 00:17:34,095
- King?
- Perdita is dead.

227
00:17:34,204 --> 00:17:38,398
And the beauty of it is…
I never laid a hand on her.

228
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:41,407
And now no one
can lay a hand on you...

229
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:44,389
As King of Vlatava,
I’m untouchable.

230
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,069
Let’s test that theory!

231
00:17:47,603 --> 00:17:50,622
Now, now, little hero,
you’ll pull your stitches.

232
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:54,022
Besides,
who exactly are you mad at?

233
00:17:54,818 --> 00:17:56,389
She died on the table.

234
00:17:57,036 --> 00:18:00,372
All that planning,
all that effort...

235
00:18:00,387 --> 00:18:02,002
Neither of us needed bothered.

236
00:18:02,136 --> 00:18:04,787
Right... And now, it must kill you
to know that you owe favors

237
00:18:04,788 --> 00:18:07,700
to Vandal Savage and...
I’m guessing five ice villains,

238
00:18:07,701 --> 00:18:08,944
for nothing!

239
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,478
Not at all!

240
00:18:10,545 --> 00:18:14,290
They played their roles in my attempt
to rid Vlatava of Perdita.

241
00:18:14,925 --> 00:18:17,030
We couldn’t know
it was unnecessary.

242
00:18:17,127 --> 00:18:20,000
So you all still deserve credit
for attempted murder!

243
00:18:20,569 --> 00:18:23,146
It’s called...
“Regicide”...

244
00:18:23,315 --> 00:18:26,744
It’s called...
“You’re busted”, jerkface!

245
00:18:28,022 --> 00:18:30,100
I believe you know
Queen Perdita...

246
00:18:30,352 --> 00:18:31,404
No...

247
00:18:31,723 --> 00:18:34,381
<i>It’s called...
“Regicide”....</i>

248
00:18:34,468 --> 00:18:36,802
Count Werner Vertigo...

249
00:18:37,511 --> 00:18:42,467
As Queen of Vlatava, I hereby accuse you
of high treason against the Crown

250
00:18:42,468 --> 00:18:45,209
and revoke your diplomatic immunity.

251
00:18:47,465 --> 00:18:48,629
No!

252
00:18:55,957 --> 00:18:58,238
Send this clown to Belle Reve.

253
00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:01,183
Well-played, children.

254
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,388
Admittedly, well-played.

255
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,070
This round goes to you.

256
00:19:05,842 --> 00:19:11,193
And, please, by all means,
allow the victory to go to your heads.

257
00:19:15,091 --> 00:19:18,944
Thank you...
Your plan worked perfectly.

258
00:19:19,527 --> 00:19:21,910
Well, when I woke up and found out
you were in Recovery,

259
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,440
I knew Vertigo would make
another attempt on your life.

260
00:19:24,502 --> 00:19:29,300
Unless, A, he thought you were dead,
and, 2, he lost that darned immunity.

261
00:19:29,412 --> 00:19:30,805
And was sent away for good.

262
00:19:33,091 --> 00:19:37,810
That sword is belonging to my country,
not to the Count.

263
00:19:38,522 --> 00:19:40,820
I would be pleased for you to have it.

264
00:19:41,587 --> 00:19:44,778
As a reward?
Or as a souvenir?

265
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,467
It is the King’s royal lunch!

266
00:20:09,961 --> 00:20:12,391
The League destroyed
the five Ice Fortresses,

267
00:20:12,392 --> 00:20:14,929
but failed to capture
whomever was behind them.

268
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:20,115
But Icicle Sr., Icicle Jr., Killer Frost,
Captain Cold and Mr. Freeze are,

269
00:20:20,116 --> 00:20:22,523
by far,
the most-likely suspects.

270
00:20:23,467 --> 00:20:24,593
That’s impossible.

271
00:20:25,283 --> 00:20:28,907
All five were in their cells
for the duration of the crisis.

272
00:20:34,787 --> 00:20:36,153
<i>The sword was cool,</i>

273
00:20:36,154 --> 00:20:39,153
<i>but this just seemed like
the right souvenir for the right mission.</i>

274
00:20:41,026 --> 00:20:43,815
Dude, I’ve just heard.
You saved an entire country!

275
00:20:44,282 --> 00:20:45,557
Major kudos!

276
00:20:46,225 --> 00:20:48,490
What can I say?
I’m the man...

277
00:20:49,306 --> 00:20:51,007
<i>The man who finally figured out</i>

278
00:20:51,008 --> 00:20:54,839
<i>that the sweetest birthday present
a lucky stiff like me could ever get...</i>

279
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,761
<i>was seeing that little girl smile.</i>

280
00:20:58,764 --> 00:21:03,849
