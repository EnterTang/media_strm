154
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,210
我喜欢海滩
I love the beach.

155
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,610
现在是不是比在家为柜子吵架好多了
Now, isn't this better than arguing about a hutch?

156
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,010
是  如果你喜欢待在
Yeah, if you like hanging out

157
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,840
巨大的鱼粑粑排泄场旁边的话
on the rim of a giant fish toilet.

158
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,200
杰茜  真不敢相信你居然带我来这里
Jess, I can't believe you brought me down here.

159
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,170
这地方挺适合谈你的问题
This is a great place to talk about your problems.

160
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,030
杰茜  这里真没劲  我想回家
Jess, this sucks-- I just want to go home.

161
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,410
施密特  到这来
Schmidt, come here.

162
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,540
看  鸟儿在蓝天翱翔
Look. You got the birds in the sky.

163
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,600
大海和沙滩
Sea and sand.

164
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,390
清风拂过我们的发丝
The wind in our hair.

165
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,170
你风筝废了
You've lost your kite!

166
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,440
放绳子玩去吧
Have fun flying your string all day!

167
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,330
抱歉我没带钱包
Sorry I forgot my wallet.

168
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,140
多谢请客哈  真好吃
Thank you for paying, it's delicious.

169
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,380
是啊  不过真的好奇怪
Yeah, which is weird,

170
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,060
我记得我明明说过
because I clearly remember saying,

171
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,590
"伙计  别忘带钱包啊"
"Hey, man, don't forget your wallet."

172
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,440
但是我还是忘带了  
And then I still forgot it.

173
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,370
-你还是忘带了  -真奇怪啊
- You still forget it. - Wow, it's weird.

174
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,160
是  你说过  
Yeah, you said that.

175
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,340
-是  我说过  -我们老了
- Yeah, I said that. - We're getting older.

176
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,350
行  这话题开场还不错
Okay, this is a good segue.

177
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,600
我能跟你说点比较严肃的话题吗
Um... can I talk to you about something that's kind of tough?

178
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,420
行  伙计  说吧
Yeah, man, shoot.

179
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,580
"本次谈话的目的
"The subject of this talk

180
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,910
是讨论我们你我之间的债务问题
is the debt of money between us.

181
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,420
-我感觉"  -我晕
- I feel that..." - Oh, man!

182
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,580
我还以为是什么严肃的话题呢
I thought this was about something serious.

183
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,350
你搞成这样我以为是要聊什么别的呢
You set that up like it was about something different.

184
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,830
是关于赌债吗
This is about the poker?

185
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,060
钱我会还你的  别担心
Oh, I'll pay you your money. Relax.

186
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,310
"如果我正在朗读此项内容  只能说明
"If I am reading this section, then I can only assume

187
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,650
你刚才让我别担心
"You have told me to relax.

188
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:14,810
你还写了这么一条 
You wrote that?

189
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,270
"我向你保证我很放松
"Let me assure you I am very relaxed,

190
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,250
尽管我很有理由担心
although I have good reason not to be,

191
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,990
因为你欠我一大笔钱"
as you owe me a very large sum."

192
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:22,160
得了吧小气鬼  我又不是不还你
I will pay you the money, you clown.

193
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,980
"我意识到咱俩都会破产
"I am aware that we're both broke,

194
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,150
其中一个显然已经破产了  此处指尼克
one of us embarrassingly so. Points to Nick.

195
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,460
我最近的财务状况急转直下
I have recently tumbled down the socioeconomic ladder

196
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,530
已经跌至谷底了
and have hit rock bottom,

197
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:31,830
而你  尼克·米勒
where you, Nick Miller,

198
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,970
已经为此等待了十五年之久
have been waiting patiently for the past 15 years.

199
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,210
但是我要那笔钱
But I want that money.

200
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,570
还我钱  我是说真的
Give me my money. I really mean it.

201
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,940
那是我的钱  你欠我的
It's my money. You owe me that money,

202
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,870
所以赶紧还钱  真的"
So give me my money. Seriously."

203
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,550
-说完了吗  -钱呢  老兄
- Are you finished? - "Where is the money, dude?

204
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:47,060
-你还写了老兄  -"我是公事公办
- You wrote "Dude"? - "But I am not without pity.

205
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,260
我同意你只还我两百块就行"
I am willing to just call it an even $200."

206
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,290
两百块扯平
Everything let go with just $200?

207
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:56,280
-对  -行啊  两百块我还得起
- Right. - All right, I can do $200.

208
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,330
-就两百  两百块咱就两清了  -没错
- $200? Two hundo clean? - Yep.

209
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,880
好
All right.

210
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,260
油钱是我付的吧
I did pay for gas here, though.

211
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,690
咱们就算它十块
So that's, let's say, ten bucks.

212
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,790
那就剩一百九了吧
So we're at $190.

213
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,460
就一百九十块
We'll say clean $190.

214
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,200
我不想纠结这些
I hate to be this guy...

215
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,020
但周五的架是我打的吧
but I got the fights on Friday,

216
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,520
那就算三十块吧  所以就剩一百六了吧
so that's $30. So let's call it $160

217
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,960
还清就行
and be done with it.

218
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:27,110
二十块的酒钱是我付的  就剩一百四了
$20 for beer that night, so $160 takes us to $140.

219
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:30,540
这可是公平起见  我可没写发言稿
Just to be fair. And I didn't write a stupid letter about it.

220
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,400
那现在就剩一百四了吧
But let's say right now $140.

221
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,650
你还吃了很多玉米片呢
You ate a lot of the nachos!

222
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:39,060
乱扔垃圾  这得算十五块吧
Littering! $15 for littering!

223
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,740
这样多有意思啊
How fun is this!

224
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,050
我不好这一口
It's not my cup of tea.

225
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,430
不要
No!

226
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,060
不要  杰茜  不
No! No, Jess, no!

227
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,790
我以前竟然没有发现  施密特
I can't believe I never noticed this before, but, Schmidt,

228
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,060
你真算得上有点神经质啊
you are legitimately crazy.

229
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,010
每个人都有点神经质  不是吗  杰茜
I think we're all a little bit crazy, don't you think, Jess?

230
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,970
不  你是属于那种  年老的芭蕾舞女
No, I mean, you're like aging- ballerina,

231
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,620
国际象棋神童  资深魔术师的神经质
child-chess-prodigy, professional-magician crazy.

232
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:15,840
是我娘的错  我出身犹太家庭
It's my mom's fault-- you know, I come from a Jewish family,

233
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,390
我妈以前告诉我圣诞老人不来我家
but she used to tell me the reason Santa didn't come to our house

234
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,050
是因为我的房间太脏了
was because my room was dirty.

235
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,010
我唯一能自主选择的就是饮食了
The only thing I ever controlled was what I ate.

236
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,350
-所以我才那么胖  -我胖是因为经常
- That's why I got fat. - Yeah, I got fat 'cause I used to eat

237
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:27,610
吃葡萄果冻拿棒棒糖当叉子
concord grape jelly from the jar using a candy bar as a fork.

238
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,610
那是因为你这人一点规矩都没有
It's because you didn't have any structure.

239
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,810
你懂我的意思吗  没有规矩放任自流
You know what I mean? That's what happens

240
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,040
最后就你这个下场
when you don't have any rules.

241
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,350
这儿每个人都没规矩  特别是那位
None of these people have rules. Especially that guy.

242
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,690
他穿着女式比基尼底裤
He's wearing ladies' bikini bottoms.

243
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,390
杰茜  我跟他们可不是一类人  好吗
Jess, I'm not like these people, okay?

244
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:43,590
我不留长毛  我也不拿蛇当宠物
I don't have dreadlocks. I don't own a snake.

245
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,780
我真搞不懂这些为啥以这种方式放松
And I don't understand how these people think that they're relaxed,

246
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,940
明显不是啊  他们只是无所事事而已
because they're not-- they just have nothing to do.

247
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,250
我可不是这样的人  我没这么容易就能放松下来的
That's not me. It's not that easy for me.

248
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,940
我觉得你就是在找借口  施密特
Sounds to me like a lot of excuses, Schmidt.

249
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,110
随性点儿吧
Just be spontaneous.

250
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,310
尼克
Hey, Nick.

251
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,150
很抱歉打扰你  因为你明显
Look, man, I'm sorry to bother you while you're clearly

252
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,090
正坐在这儿赚钱呢
sitting here working hard making lots of money.

253
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,740
-说得好  -请原谅我耽误你一会儿
- All right. - But if you'd kindly just pause that for one second,

254
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,840
我这儿有些账要跟你算一下
I have a few accounts that I'd like to settle.

255
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,700
账目一
Account number one:

256
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,790
一张15块的唐人街箱龟收据
a $15 receipt for a Chinatown box turtle.

257
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,470
-你可瞧好了  -亲兄弟明算账是吧
- Bam. Here we go. - We're doing this, huh?

258
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,020
亲兄弟可不就要明算账  账目二
Yeah, we are doing this. Item number two:

259
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:51,470
一张35块的已作废的域名注册支票
Cancelled $35 check for registration of a domain name--

260
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,080
"尼克·米勒时光网"
"It's Nick Miller Time.Com."

261
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,150
"伙计们  温斯顿  我有个好点子
"Hey, guys, Winston, I got a good idea, man.

262
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,370
我要成为一个顶尖的博客写手"
I'm gonna be a big-time blogger."

263
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,020
我要去工作了
I have to go to work...

264
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,080
在一个让你蹭吃蹭喝的酒吧
...at a bar, where you drink for free.

265
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,410
400毫升白兰地兑可乐是多少钱
How much does 400 cognac and colas add up to, Winston?

266
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,350
你要纠结这个吗  行
You want to go there? Okay. Sure.

267
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:08,130
那时我整天在你身边听你发牢骚怨念
How about all the times I sat around listening to you bitch and moan

268
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,660
卡洛琳是如何蹂躏你那珍贵的小心灵
about how Caroline broke your precious little heart?

269
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,620
-八年级时...  -扯八年级去了
- Okay, in eighth grade... - Eighth grade.

270
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:16,110
你"一不小心"就看我妈裸着
...you "accidentally" Saw my mom naked.

271
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:19,610
还是在她停止运动身材走样之前
Before she stopped exercising and let herself get chubby.

272
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,990
这伤害如果能用钱来衡量  你欠我多少
So how much is that, in terms of money?

273
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,180
因为我可一直深受其扰啊
'Cause I haven't gotten over that.

274
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,780
-怎么也要四五千块吧  -各位
- And I would say four to $5,000. - Hey, guys. Hey, guys.

275
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,170
施密特  温斯顿八年级时
Schmidt, Winston saw my mother

276
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,570
看到我妈裸着  这要用...
naked in eighth grade; in terms of...

277
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,920
我没穿户外鞋就直接在大海里涉水了
I waded into the ocean without my aqua socks.

278
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,310
他的确做到了
Mm, he did it.

279
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,720
-我做到了  -他放松了
- I did it. - He let go.

280
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,530
他在公共卫生间里洗了手
He washed his hands in a public restroom.

281
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,000
当时还有个男人在那儿
And there was a man in there.

282
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:44,790
他在上厕所  还用的敞开式蹲式马桶
And he was using the toilet, full sit, no door.

283
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,360
我就一直盯着他看
And I didn't break eye contact.

284
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,000
目不转睛
Not once.

285
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,730
这不叫放松  这叫暗送秋波
That's not letting go, that's cruising.

286
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,070
施密特
Hey, Schmidt.

287
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,550
-他吐到桌子上了  -我看到了
- There's a spill. - I know.

288
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,420
练习一下  你懂的
Do your exercise. You know.

289
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,020
对  好的  练习
Yeah, okay, the exercise.

290
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,400
一  二  三  四  五  六  
One, two, three, four, five, six,

291
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,380
七  八  九  十
seven, eight, nine, ten.

292
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,420
我感觉好极了
I feel great.

293
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,000
我要去用尼克的肥皂洗个澡
I'm gonna go take a shower with Nick's bar soap,

294
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,680
像普通的农场工人那样
like a common ranch hand.

295
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,430
不  不  不
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

296
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,960
-不  不  不  -这什么情况
- no, no, no, no, no, no, no! -What is going on?

297
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,690
你打乱了这里的生态平衡
You messed with the ecosystem.

298
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,520
而你们说我做不到的
And you guys said it couldn't be done.

299
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,340
你可不知道你捅了多大篓子
You have no idea what you're getting into.

300
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,560
不用谢我
You're welcome.

301
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,880
施密特  你这鼓声真要命
Schmidt, you're killing me with that drumming!

302
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,280
要人命啊
You're killing me!

303
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,970
乱成这样了  怎么搞的啊
Look at this mess. How did this happen?

304
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,750
都是你的错
So, this is your fault.

305
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,630
不  才不是
No. No.

306
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,130
我是为了施密特好
This is good for Schmidt.

307
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:40,890
你俩占他的便宜不是一天两天了
'Cause you guys have been taking advantage of him for years.

308
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,740
让他做饭  让他打扫
You make him cook, you make him clean...

309
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,140
欠我的钱呢  伙计
Where's my money, dude?

310
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,030
老实说  你们这么做是...性别歧视
Frankly, it's... sexist.

311
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,060
天哪  真恶心
Oh, my God. Ew@

312
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,670
怎么会是性别歧视
How's it sexist?

313
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,870
谁来打扫
Who's cleaning up?

314
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,100
-我早上收拾过了  -好吧
- I cleaned this morning. - All right, fine.

315
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,810
我来收拾  你俩去买东西
I'll clean, you guys go to the store.

316
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,550
我才不要和他一起去
I'm not going to the store with him.

317
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:00,540
-不许扔东西  -还我钱  伙计
- Stop throwing things at each other. - Where's my money, dude...?

318
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:03,190
-都别闹了  -还我钱
- Oh, come on. - Where is the money?

319
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,540
-你真幼稚  -还有我的车
- You're a child. ...- my car, too, while you...

320
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,300
安静  朋友们
Silence, friends!

321
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,590
我给大家做了项链
I made you necklaces.

322
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,300
想去商店转转吗
Hey, do you want to go to the store?

323
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,630
快点吧  走吧
Please, God, yes.

324
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,540
一百块
$100?

325
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,550
施密特是怎么只花一百块就买到这堆东西的
How did Schmidt buy all these groceries with 100 bucks?

326
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,660
-只有一百块  -一百块
- It's only $100? - $100.

327
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,380
你早说嘛  我们买的东西太多了 
You should've told... we have way too much stuff, man.

328
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,500
比如鸡尾冷虾  
Yeah, like shrimp cocktail.

329
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,300
我们不需要烤火腿
We don't need a baked ham.

330
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,690
-好吧  -温斯顿  
- All right. - Winston?

331
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,880
-真抱歉  -是吗
- Sorry about that. - Really?

332
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,120
两份蛋糕粉
Two cake mixes?

333
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,830
我晕  还有这些汤  披萨  冻披萨
Really? All these soups? Pizza? Frozen pizza?

334
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,810
-你个死胖子  -你想干嘛  想死啊
- You fat ass. - What are you trying to do, die?

335
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:29,480
闭嘴
Shut up, dude.

336
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,300
家里的番茄酱够了
We have enough ketchup.

337
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,080
-我们有足够的番茄酱  -拜托  
- We have enough ketchup! - Come on, really?

338
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,210
下一个
Next, please.

339
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,510
你好吗  先生
Oh, hey, how you doing, sir?

340
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,330
我们只有一百块  盖瑞  
We only have $100, Gary,

341
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:38,450
满一百块的时候就别刷了好吗
so could you stop checking us out when we hit $100?

342
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,660
对  还要把税算在里面
Yeah, you got to include tax, too,

343
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,930
-就只买九十三块的东西  好吗  -对  就这样
-so, like, $93, just... cool? - Yeah, just that'll do.

344
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:42,920
好吧
Okay, guys.

345
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,760
谢了  我要把我的东西放在前面
Thanks. I'm gonna put my stuff at the front,

346
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,800
因为你根本不知道什么该买
'cause you obviously don't know how to shop.

347
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,720
你太可笑了
You're being ridiculous.

348
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:48,330
你听到我说的话没
Are you getting me?

349
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,380
我们的番茄酱够多了
We have enough ketchup.

350
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,140
泻盐
Epsom salt?

351
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,540
你就不能用普通盐么
What, are you too good for regular salt?

352
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,550
你明知道我要用它来泡脚
You know damn well I got to soak my trick foot.

353
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,640
温尼  对哦  你那双折腾人的脚
Oh, Winnie, your little trick foot.

354
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,860
对  我的脚是很折腾人  不许再叫我温尼
Yeah, my trick foot, and don't ever call me Winnie.

355
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,950
-温尼  -好吧
- Aw, Winnie... - Fine.

356
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:01,760
你什么都不欠我了
You don't owe me anything.

357
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,200
咱俩一笔勾销  扯平了
The slate is clean. We're good, we're even.

358
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,490
很好  我也这么觉得
Oh, good, that's how I feel, too.

359
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:08,530
因为我觉得  你娘的咪咪是最美的
Because in my mind, your mom will always be the winner of Best Boobs

360
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:09,140
是吗  最美的咪咪
Really, Best Boobs?

361
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,570
-专家级的  -你居然敢谈论我妈
- Yeah. Master's Division. - You're gonna talk about my mother?

362
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:12,590
你敢谈论我妈的胸
You're gonna talk about my mom's boobs?

363
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,690
你真想这么干吗
Is that... you gonna go there?

364
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,780
别在超市里推我
Don't push me in a supermarket, man.

365
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,180
你挑起来的
You started this.

366
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,590
-你刚扇了我一巴掌吗  -我没有
- Did you just slap me in the face? - No, I did not.

367
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,180
我不知道你在说啥
I don't know what you're talking about.

368
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,380
我不怕你
I'm not afraid of you, man.

369
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,170
别跟个...
Don't act your...

370
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,370
成熟点  伙计
Grow up, dude!

371
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,730
施密特
Hey, Schmidt.

372
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,790
你好啊  杰茜  
Oh, hello, Jess.

373
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,450
你在这儿干啥
Hey. What are you doing out here?

374
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:49,190
来看看你在不在
Oh, just checking up on you.

375
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,350
你在吃路边摊的肉卷啊
Oh, I see you're eating street meat wrapped in street meat.

376
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,910
这是我兄弟  戈登
This is my man, Gordon.

377
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,880
你又一次超常发挥了  戈登
You've outdone yourself once again, Gordon.

378
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,040
真棒
Excellent.

379
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,490
-你今天去上班了吗  -没  没工作
- Did you go to work today? - No, no. No work.

380
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:01,580
我有一阵子没去了
I haven't been there in a while.

381
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,000
-一阵子是多久  -不知道  三天吧
- How long is a while? - I don't know. Three days?

382
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,910
施密特  带你来这里是个错误
Schmidt, I made a mistake in bringing you down here.

383
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,570
我不该这么做
I shouldn't have done that.

384
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,480
回家吧
Please come home.

385
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,820
为啥
Why?

386
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,010
回家做饭打扫卫生么
So I can cook and clean?

387
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,240
告诉你真空吸尘器在哪儿么
So I can show you where the vacuum is?

388
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,140
来吧
All right.

389
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,400
好吧  是的  我不知道真空吸尘器在哪儿
Okay, fine, I don't know where the vacuum is.

390
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,480
这是我来这儿找你的一部分原因
That is one reason why I came here,

391
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,230
但我真的想让你回家
but I really want you to come home.

392
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,620
没有你一切都乱了套
Everything's falling apart without you.

393
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,560
尼克和温斯顿一直在打架
Nick and Winston are fighting all the time.

394
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,050
我们都弄丢了邮箱钥匙
And all of us lost our keys to the mailbox.

395
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:37,800
施密特  听我说
Schmidt, just listen to me, because you

396
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,440
你压根不属于这里  真的
don't belong here, like, really.

397
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,670
你还记得你不喜欢看
Do you remember when you got yourself off to

398
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,900
《难以忽视的真相》的时候吗
An Inconvenient Truth?

399
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,200
你还记不记得万圣节时
How about when you dress up

400
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,980
你穿得像《华尔街2》里的希安·拉博夫[美国演员]
like Shia Labeouf from Wall Street Two for Halloween?

401
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,690
你记不记得你说过
Do you remember when you said

402
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:54,130
爵士乐是美国最大的错误
jazz music was America's greatest mistake?

403
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:56,110
伴着鼓声说吧  杰茜卡·戴
Say it in drums, Jessica Day.

404
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,380
伴着鼓声
Me hablo drums.

405
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,350
伙计
Hey, man.

406
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,090
最后一个冰的东西被我拿了
I got the last frozen thing.

407
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,500
我本想敷下手腕的  但是
I was gonna ice my wrist, but...

408
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,990
这样吧
How about this?

409
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,840
咱平半分  伙计
Take half, pal.

410
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,400
你真好
So kind of you.

411
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,360
疼死我了
That hurts, man.

412
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,140
我好饿
I am so hungry.

413
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,530
还记得以前施密特给我们用
Remember those things that Schmidt used to make us

414
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:24,300
花生酱拌芹菜加葡萄干吗
with the peanut butter and the raisins on the celery?

415
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,100
叫啥来着
What were those called?

416
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:25,900
蚂蚁上树
Ants on a log.

417
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,370
蚂蚁上树
Ants on a log.

418
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,820
我知道为啥要叫蚂蚁上树了
I just got why they're called ants on a log.

419
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,490
因为看着像蚂蚁在书上
Looks like ants on a log.

420
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:33,980
我饿了
I'm hungry, man.

421
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,000
施密特  是你吗伙计
Hey, Schmidt, is that you, buddy?

422
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,840
不是  是我
No, it's me.

423
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,170
你咋了
What the hell happened to you?

424
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,770
我去了沙滩
I went down to the beach,

425
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,670
我试着和施密特谈谈
and I tried to talk to Schmidt,

426
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,350
可他不理我
but he just ignored me,

427
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:47,050
只顾着玩他的火棍
and he went back to twirling his fire baton.

428
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,160
他技术太差了  烧到了好多人
He's really bad. He burned a lot of people.

429
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,260
我觉得应该在点着火之前
I feel like they should let you twirl it around a few times

430
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,900
先把棍子转几圈
before they actually light it on fire.

431
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,790
杰茜  和施密特做朋友就是很纠结
Well, look, Jess, being friends with Schmidt is really complicated.

432
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,640
因为你很想改变他
'Cause you want to change him so badly,

433
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,880
可你不能  因为他只会越变越糟
but you can't 'cause he'll just get worse.

434
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,240
你们说的对  我打乱了这个生态平衡
You guys were right, I upset the ecosystem.

435
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,070
我本意不是这样的
This is not what I wanted.

436
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,600
我只是想把贮藏柜摆在这里
I just wanted to put my hutch here.

437
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,600
让这儿印上我的印记  融入这个家庭而已
Make the place my own, be a part of the family.

438
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,460
什么家庭  跟这些二货吗
What family? With these clowns?

439
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,510
是呀  你们这几个二货呗
Yeah, you clowns.

440
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,250
没问题  我批准你加入了
Well, look, you want in, you're in.

441
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,660
恭喜  欢迎来到这个家  杰茜
Congratulations, welcome to the family, Jess.

442
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,420
咱家不这么表达
Yeah, we don't "aww" in this family.

443
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:35,970
伙计们
Hey, guys.

444
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:36,780
施密特
Hey, Schmidt.

445
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,370
我们得谈谈
Um, we need to talk.

446
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:42,770
有啥不对劲吗
Something not cool?

447
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,890
施密特  我们想你
Schmidt, we miss you.

448
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,380
你们只是想让我打扫屋子
You just want me to clean.

449
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,420
不是的  完全不是
No, that's not true.

450
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,760
好吧  有一点点啦
Well, it's a little bit true. There's truth to that.

451
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,910
好吧  我想让你打扫屋子
Okay, look. I want you to clean.

452
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:56,590
听着  我们为你能放松下来而骄傲
Look, we're so proud of you for letting go, and relaxing.

453
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,300
但你并不是这种人
But this isn't like you.

454
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,870
你逃避得了现在的问题
You can run away from your problems,

455
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:04,600
但没准又会遇到新的麻烦  比如肝炎之类的
but you're just gonna find new ones that pop up like hepatitis.

456
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,360
尼克和温斯顿
And Nick and Winston

457
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,090
想对你说  他们真的很想你
want to say to you that they really miss you.

458
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:10,550
伙计  你快让我抓狂了
You're freaking me out, man.

459
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,940
你干嘛在脖子上戴个水晶项链
Why are you wearing that crystal around your neck?

460
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,090
尼克  水晶代表能量
Nick, the crystal symbolizes energy.

461
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,430
它也就是块石头而已  施密特
All a crystal is is rock poo, Schmidt.

462
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,320
我需要你  施密特
Look, I need you, Schmidt.

463
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:22,130
懂吗  我需要你来告诉我哪条裤子不能穿
Okay, I need you to tell me what pants not to wear

464
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:23,990
还有提醒我多做运动
and to exercise more often.

465
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,080
我需要你在我把铁板三明治
I need you to make fun of me

466
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,940
叫成热三明治时笑话我
when I call a Panini a hot sandwich;

467
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,410
不然我怎么会懂这些呢
how am I ever gonna learn?

468
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,600
我还想你润发乳的味道
I even miss your hair chutney.

469
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,490
伙计  如果没有你  我们只是三个住一起的傻瓜
Without you, man, we're just three idiots who live together.

470
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:37,900
是你让我们成为一家人
You make us a family.

471
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,100
我就像是个反叛的大哥
Well, I'm the cool rebel brother.

472
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,230
-你就像个老妈  -老妈  -妈
- You're the mom. - The mother. - Mom.

473
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,200
施密特  如果你回到我们身边
Look, Schmidt, if you come back to us,

474
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,810
我让你打扫我的房间
I'll let you clean my room.

475
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,790
处理那只大白鲸也行吗
The white whale?

476
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:56,110
想想我床下有多少积尘
Think about how many dust bunnies are under my bed.

477
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,360
多少臭烘烘的袜子
How many stray socks.

478
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,630
施密特
Hey, Schmidt,

479
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,090
我有东西送你
I got you something.

480
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,480
是个礼品盒吗
Is that a boutique box?

481
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:07,680
是一条闪瞎你眼的灰色斜纹  平直款的裤子
A pair of gray, shiny, twill, flat-front trousers

482
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:10,500
由一个叫卡尔文的人设计的哟
designed by a man named Calvin.
美国着名设计师  CK品牌创始人

483
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,060
崭新无痕
Never been tried on.

484
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,930
口袋还缝着呢
Pockets are sewn shut.

485
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:17,450
难道你不想把拇指塞进去撕开它吗
Don't you just want to get your thumbs in there and rip?

486
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:22,800
好吧  我就把它搁在你的手鼓上
Okay, so, I'm just gonna leave this on your bongo drum,

487
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:25,040
如果你喜欢
and you can, you know,

488
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,390
可以试一试哦
give them a whirl if you feel like it.

489
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,700
要做好选择哟
Just make the right decision.

490
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:36,510
回家来吧
Come home.

491
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,630
穿上那裤子
Take the pants.

492
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,550
好吧
Oh, come here.

493
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,640
卡尔文
Calvin.

494
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,390
你真是个无与伦比的巫师
You magnificent wizard.

495
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,510
小施
Scmidtty.

496
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,170
尼克  你的发型怎么又这么挫
Nick, your hair is doing that thing that I just... I just hate.

497
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,710
杰茜  你让温斯顿帮你
And Jess, can you please ask Winston to help you

498
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:19,640
挪挪家具吧  他得锻炼一下了
move the furniture out? He could use the exercise.

499
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,340
你看起来有点儿...
You're looking a little, you know...

500
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:25,180
-他回来了  -尼克  温斯顿  我们有夜壶的
- He's back. - And Nick, Winston, we have a urinal.

501
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,980
你们怎么还会忘
How are you still missing?

502
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,720
施密特
Schmidt

503
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,430
施密特  醒醒
Schmidt, wake up.

504
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,060
你
What...

505
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:39,620
你在这儿干吗
are you doing here?

506
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,660
你觉得我能干嘛  来吧
What do you think I'm doing here? Come on!

507
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,630
-好了  等等  等等  -怎么了
- Okay, wait, wait, wait. - What?

508
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,740
希希
Cece,

509
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,310
在我们继续之前
before we continue,

510
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,720
我在这段关系中毫无控制权
I clearly have no control in this relationship,

511
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,030
我也不介意
and... I'm fine with it.

512
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,840
-好  -但你要知道
- Good. - But know this,

513
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:58,890
你半夜三点破门而入
you're the one who broke into this apartment at 3:00 a.M.

514
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,060
来找小施密特尝点甜头
for a little bit of this Schmidt,

515
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,710
所以  谁是真正掌控全局的呢
so who's really in control?

516
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,140
闭嘴
Shut up!

517
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,320
等等  你睡觉还穿着正装裤子
Wait, oh, are you sleeping in dress pants?

518
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,670
咋了  这裤子很宽松的
What? They're slacks.

519
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,710
没啥大不了的  淡定
What's the big deal? Calm down.

520
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,930
看我老二见了你得有多兴奋
Look how excited Hector J. is to see you.

521
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,250
我看到了
Yeah, I've already met Hector J., so...

522
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,390
看  他在给你加官进爵
Ooh, look, he's knighting you.

523
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,740
不  停下来  不要
Oh, no, please stop knighting me. Don't...

524
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,570
希希莉亚小姐
Lady Cecelia...

525
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,510
别  施密特  不然我走了
No, Schmidt, I'm gonna leave.

526
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,120
你已进入圆桌会议的流程
You have entered the order of the round table.

527
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,720
我这就去拿包  我这就去...
I'm getting my bag, okay, I'm gonna get my...

528
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,350
-我还是留下吧  - 性感的希希夫人
- Oh, I want to stay. - Dame Nasty Cece.
