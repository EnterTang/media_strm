漫威电视出品

2
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,960
好  这样吧  给他上三副铐
All right, here's the plan. Triple-cuff him.

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,520
一队  负责押送
Alpha team, you take point positions in the convoy.

4
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,430
二队断后
Bravo team will bring up the rear.

5
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,370
记住  我们可以开火
Remember, we're clear to engage,

6
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,480
如果他眼神有点不对  就来上一枪
so if he so much as looks at you funny, light him up.

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,510
收到
Copy that.

8
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:30,800
听到了吗  疯子  我有特别为你准备的东西
You hear that, freak? I got something special for you.

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,270
没必要这样
This isn't necessary.

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,570
有必要
Yeah, it is.

11
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,530
不行  你得让我们处理好  奈特小姐
No. You need to let us finish. Ms. Knight. Ms. Knight!

12
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,690
是奈特警官  我没事
It's Detective Knight, and I'm fine.

13
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,230
我想和凯奇谈谈
I need a moment with Cage.

14
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,030
米丝蒂  我们有特殊命令
Misty, we have special orders.

15
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,080
马里奥  别这样
Mario, come on.

16
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,590
我刚被人挟持
I was just held hostage.

17
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,990
我只想跟他谈谈
I just need a minute with him.

18
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,950
我们会在这里  有我们在
All right. We'll be right here. We got your back.

19
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:16,730
安全
Clear!

20
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,370
你完蛋了
You going down.

21
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,440
也是时候了
It's about damn time.

22
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,610
水腹蛇  阿尔比尼警官  还有这里发生的事
Cottonmouth, Officer Albini, what just popped off in there...

23
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,850
你朋友逃走了
Look, your friend is in the wind.

24
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,690
他们现在铐上了头号公敌
They've got public enemy number one in handcuffs

25
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,360
让世界看到
for the whole world to see...

26
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,220
这样他们就不用去找别人了
so they're not looking for anybody else.

27
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:48,140
护送你的警官都配有改良版犹大子弹
Every officer in your detail has those modified Judas bullets.

28
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,140
换我是你  在抵达警局之前
I wouldn't try anything if I were you...

29
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,000
可不会耍什么花招
before I got to the precinct.

30
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,030
你没有那么疯狂吧
You're not that crazy, are you?

31
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,600
一向没有
Always.

32
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,000
把他送去监狱
Take his ass to jail.

33
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,820
走吧
Come on.

34
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,910
我们走  上路
All right, let's go. We're rolling.

35
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,360
三副手铐  是不是有点过分了
Three sets of cuffs? Isn't that overkill?

36
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,980
有相机呢  我们得装出一副尽在掌控中的样子
The camera's on. We need to look like we're in control.

37
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,850
这押送烂透了
It's a shit detail.

38
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,400
你还以为紧急情况小队的人
You'd think ESU would be in the back

39
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,050
会在后面拿着枪指着他呢
with those guns pointed at him.

40
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,670
我们也有同样的枪和子弹
We've got the same guns and bullets they do.

41
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,830
我妻子说会出现他这种人
You know, my wife says it's the end of days,

42
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,380
是因为要世界末日了
people like him popping up.

43
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,450
自从夏娃咬了苹果后她们就一直这么说
They've been saying that since Eve bit the apple.

44
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,240
凯奇是进化了
Cage? He's evolution.

45
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,090
不管他是什么  都很可怕
Whatever he is, it's just scary.

46
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,080
让我感觉自己很渺小  无礼
Makes me feel small. Insignificant.

47
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,390
不安全感
Insecure?

48
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,960
他们经常说  只要你是黑人  就回不了头
You know what they say. Once you go black, you never go back.

49
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,010
至少我妻子经常和我这么说
At least that's what your wife keeps telling me.

50
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,790
她回家的时候我早就睡着了
I was fast asleep when she came home.

51
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,950
你女儿老是搞得我很累
Your daughter already wore me out.

52
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,570
坐稳了
Just sit tight.

53
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,220
该死
God damn it.

54
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,730
流浪老太  就不能让她挪边上去吗
Homeless lady. Can't they move her out of the way?

55
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,190
你阻碍了警方押运
You are in the path of a police convoy.

56
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,950
请马上让开
Clear the road immediately.

57
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,040
快
Come on!

58
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,100
凯奇逃跑了  开火
Cage must not escape. Fire at will!

59
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,680
快快快
Go, go, go, go, go!

60
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,530
他往南边跑了
He went down the south side.

61
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,710
谁给我汇报一下情况
Somebody give me a sitrep right now!

62
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,250
二队  上  上
Team two... Let's go, let's go!

63
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,730
年轻的警察总是喜欢追着人跑
Young cops always wanna chase somebody.

64
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,370
我呢  更喜欢在人家会去的地方等着
Me, I'd rather be where they're already going.

65
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,670
他们告诉我犹大能干掉你这样的人
They told us these Judas bullets can kill someone like you.

66
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,090
你不想死吗  那就别跑
You don't want to die? Don't run.

67
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,840
我宁死也不要回到监狱
I'd rather die than go back to prison.

68
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,810
不自由毋宁死
Live free or die?

69
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,700
你想来新汉普顿这一套
You wanna get all New Hampshire about this shit?

70
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,910
我没意见
Fine with me.

71
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,580
-警察杀手人人喊打  -我没有杀警察
- Cop killers don't survive these streets. - I didn't kill a cop.

72
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,750
我跟你或你们没有过节
My problem isn't with you or yours.

73
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,050
我有更大的问题要担心
It's much bigger than that.

74
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,180
有人因为你的所作所为而称你为英雄
Some people are calling you a hero for what you did.

75
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,560
在康妮家  老爹的店
Connie's, Pop's...

76
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,290
我不是英雄
I'm no hero.

77
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,930
但我的确要干掉要为这一切负责的人
But I do need to take out the person responsible for all this.

78
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,970
你不认识我了吧
You don't recognize me, do you?

79
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,240
你在老爹的店见过你
I've seen you at Pop's before.

80
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,550
老爹剪了我12年的头发
Pop cut my hair for 12 years.

81
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,280
他也不觉得自己是英雄
He didn't think he was a hero, either.

82
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:18,030
他只是在做了几年错事后想要弥补
He was just trying to do some right after years of wrong.

83
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,540
我希望我对你的看法没错
I hope I'm right about you.

84
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,740
支持你的人比你想象中的要多
More people rooting for you than you think.

85
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,570
-你要怎么告诉你的同僚  -实话实说
- What are you gonna tell your people? - The truth.

86
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,980
我看到你了  但你甩掉了我
I had you in my sights, but you outran me.

87
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,190
我老了
I'm getting old.

88
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:39,890
卢克
Luke?

89
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,180
你最好抓住那个狡猾的混蛋
You better catch that slippery son of a bitch.

90
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,190

很高兴你打给我  威利斯
Hey, I'm glad you called me, Willis.

Luke Cage is on the run. They got Shades in bracelets,

100
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,680

but they're gonna be onto you before long, brother.

101
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,120
你最好知道
Best believe that.

102
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,180
赶紧消失  把现金盘了  才是你最好的选择
Getting ghost and liquidizing your cash, that was the right move.

103
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,650
必须谨慎对待卢克·凯奇...
Luke Cage must be approached with...

104
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,990
换我可不会乱碰
I wouldn't touch any of that.

105
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,420
一般人不会一而再测试我的耐性
People don't test me more than once.

106
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,810
我明白
I overstand.

107
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:47,190
你想让我干什么
What you need me for?

108
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,130
我知道你是一个有判断和品位的男人
I understand you're a man of discretion and taste

109
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:56,040
并且有大量对我商品有兴趣的买家人脉
with numerous connections willing to pay full price for my wares.

110
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,530
我仍然可以东山再起
I can still collect from the shadows.

111
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:01,170
-坏消息  响尾蛇  -把墨镜摘了
- Bad news, Diamondback. - Take those off!

112
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:06,710
我去了你的房间  你的档案都不见了
I went to your crib. The files you had are gone.

113
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,060
你是我的人  不是吗
I had you, didn't I?

114
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,140
完全同意
I couldn't resist.

115
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,290
我喜欢你  奇普
I like you, Zip.

116
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,540
你有雄心壮志  这让你前途无量
You've got ambition. It'll take you far...

117
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,640
但是你要做你该做的事

权力的48条法则第一条
The first of the 48 laws of power.

119
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,540
做人要低调
Never outshine the master.

120
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,440
沙兹就犯过这种错误
That was the mistake Shades made.

121
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,050
他质疑我  他怀疑我  他想自己单干
He questioned me. He doubted me. He tried to reach too far.

122
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,690
他想成为伊卡洛斯那种人
He was on some Icarus shit.

123
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,430
你知道那是谁吗
Do you know who that is?

124
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,700
-知道  他和肯德里克写了一首诗  -不
- Yeah, he had a verse with Kendrick. Right? - No...

125
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:15,160
伊卡洛斯是一个戴着假翅膀飞向太阳的孩子
Icarus was the boy who flew too close to the sun with fake wings.

126
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,190
沙兹不是问题  他还在被拘禁
Shades is no problem. He's still in custody.

127
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,330
马上就不是了
Not for long.

128
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,610
你要把监狱炸掉吗
You gonna blow the joint up?

129
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,730
不  他马上要被保释出来了
No, he's going to be bailed out.

130
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,480
为什么  这没有道理
The hell for? That don't make no sense!

131
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,170
看到了吗  这就是质疑
See? The questioning.

132
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,270
一切从此开始
That's how it starts.

133
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,760
我需要一个助手
I'm gonna have an opening.

134
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,400
你要来吗
You gonna step up?

135
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,790
我愿意为你马首是瞻
I'm down to do whatever you need.

136
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,110
-没有问题  -好孩子
- No problem. - Good boy.

137
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,590
你愿意吗
So are you down?

138
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,810
我愿意
I'm down.

139
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,740
只要有买卖做  我就没问题
As long as the business is business, I'm good with it.

140
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,910
没有买卖  恕不奉陪
Till then, I'm out of here, man.

141
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,740
奇普  给特科展示一下
Show Turk out, Zip.

142
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,900
这位罗密欧是在阴间也是可以呼风唤雨的人
Romeo would roll over in his grave,

143
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,720
你不过只是在小猫小狗面前耍耍花枪
the way you hop-skipping with these cats nowadays.

144
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,290
他是个道上的真爷们  你只是个孩子
He was a man on these streets. You's a boy.

145
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,990
你他妈在说什么
What the hell are you talking about?

146
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,970
你和我一样  就是看中了他的钱
You're down here in his pocket, same as me.

147
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:28,050
是的  我在和他做生意
I'm doing business with him, yes.

148
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,770
但我不是他的手下  更不是他的走狗
But I ain't his boy. And I definitely ain't his bitch.

149
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,460
这些老头子只会胡言乱语
These old-ass niggas talkin' about shit

150
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,950
他们什么都不知道
they don't even know about.

151
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,980
箱子里有什么
So... what's in the box?

152
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,810
有七宗罪之一  我的孩子
One of the seven deadly sins, my boy...

153
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,330
我要把它宣泄在我的老朋友卡尔身上
which I plan to unleash on dear old Carl.

154
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:58,800
哪一宗呢
Which one?

155
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,710
愤怒
Wrath.

156
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:07,770
我们需要处理响尾蛇

157
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:15,020
欧内斯托是对的  多明戈  现在是绝佳的机会

158
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,370
我们有实力

159
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:23,920
况且在古巴  牙买加  多米尼加和海地的领袖死了的情况下

160
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:28,850
我们将拥有毒品  枪支  所有的一切

161
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,070
一跃称王

162
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,560
他把他们全部干掉时我就在场
I was there when he took them all out.

163
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,440
我就在隔壁
Right next door.

164
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,840
我们有毒品
We got the drugs.

165
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,690
我们有钱
We got that money.

166
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:48,200
但是我们有了枪  就控制了一切
But with the guns, we can control everything.

167
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,320
这里  那些岛屿  以及南方
Here, the islands, further south...

168
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,390
我们将所向披靡
We'd be unstoppable.

169
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:58,940
所以你有什么计划

170
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,710
我们把他救出来
We take him out.

171
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,300
我们去夺回属于我们的一切
We go after what's ours.

172
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,490
我们去找响尾蛇
Let's go find Diamondback.

173
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:17,600
纽约警署
阿尔瓦雷斯·埃尔南

174
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,910
面向照相机
Turn and face the camera.
纽约警署
阿尔瓦雷斯·埃尔南

175
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:25,590
纽约警署
阿尔瓦雷斯·埃尔南

176
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,770
好了  下一个
All right, let's go. Move it.

177
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,380
你应该在医院的
You're supposed to be in the hospital.

178
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,230
太急着拼命只会让
Push yourself too hard too soon

179
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,170
一切变得更糟
and you could make it worse, you know.

180
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,540
-谢谢你的关心  -你一点都不领情
- I appreciate your concern. - No, you don't.

181
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,490
我需要一个彻底健康的你
I need you at 100%.

182
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,760
我要证明卢克·凯奇是无辜的
I need to prove Luke Cage is innocent.

183
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,430
人质都一直坚持
Well, the hostages have all been consistent

184
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,040
卢克·凯奇从来没有用枪指着他们
that Luke Cage never held them at gunpoint.

185
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,760
他中了圈套  你知道的  普莉希拉
He was set up. You know it, Priscilla.

186
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,020
警察局一半的人都他妈知道
Half this damn department knows it.

187
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,590
我们需要追查威利斯·斯崔克
We need to be going after Willis Stryker.

188
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,660
那么为什么卢克·凯奇逃跑了
Well, then why is Luke Cage running?

189
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:20,060
他一个黑人  被持有特殊子弹的警察
He's a black man being chased by the cops...

190
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:22,070
到处追捕
oh, with special bullets.

191
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,690
被指控谋杀警察
Accused of killing a cop,

192
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:27,090
你还问他为什么逃跑吗  拜托
and you're asking why he's running? Come on.

193
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:36,060
看看阿尔瓦雷斯·"沙兹"·埃尔南多么惬意
Look at how relaxed Hernan "Shades" Alvarez is.

194
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,410
他知道他哪里都不会去的
He knows he's not going anywhere anytime soon,

195
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,500
所以怡然自得
so he's resting up.

196
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,120
他知道他是有罪的
He knows he's guilty.

197
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,580
看到这名罪犯了吗
See this perp?

198
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,220
看他在抖腿  说明他紧张
Look how his foot is bouncing. Nervous.

199
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,550
难怪他的诨号是"糖糖"
No wonder his street name is Sugar.

200
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,480
我都不用问他  就能知道很多信息
I don't even have to say a word, and here come the waterworks.

201
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,640
他很有可能是无辜的
He's probably innocent...

202
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,880
或者和他要供出的人比就是个小卒
or less guilty than whoever he's about to give up.

203
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,370
这水平堪比警探老婆
That's a detectives' wives' tale.

204
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,560
你不能通过这个就判定是否有罪
You can't prove guilt or innocence by that.

205
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,020
但是你可以
Oh, but you can...

206
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,830
-因为卢克向你承诺过了  -卢克
- because Luke gave you his word. - Luke--

207
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,810
现在他的行为比他的承诺更有说服力
Right now, his actions are speaking louder than his words.

208
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,200
卢克·凯奇
Luke Cage...

209
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,540
救了我的命
saved my life.

210
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:28,050
我从不质疑我们是否应该追捕响尾蛇
I don't dispute that we should be bringing in Diamondback,

211
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:31,410
但是为了真相大白  我们应该把两个人都带回来
but to get to the truth, we need to bring them both in.

212
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:38,410
好吧  让我把话说在前面
Okay, well, let me lead the charge.

213
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,730
一定要确保卢克被安全地带回来
Make sure Luke is brought in safely.

214
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,170
他跳出押运车的时候就已经失去机会了
He threw away his chance when he jumped out that damn van.

215
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,640
现在正像市长期望的那样
Now they will shoot him on sight

216
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,230
警察一看到他就会开枪
with the mayor's blessing.

217
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,770
你知道吗  至少让我审一下沙兹
You know what? At least let me take a crack at Shades.

218
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,520
他和所有人都关系匪浅
He's in deep with all the players.

219
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,630
他吓不到我
He doesn't scare me.

220
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,960
-警探  -我能解决他
- Detective-- - I can handle him.

221
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,390
你刚刚被枪击
You just got shot.

222
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,160
我想要你回家  休息一下
I need you to go home, get some rest.

223
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,120
我来审沙兹
I'll interview Shades.

224
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:24,370
我祖母非常喜欢哈莱姆天堂
My grandmother loved Harlem's Paradise.

225
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:31,360
她处理这里的每一个细节
She took care of all the small details.

226
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,820
她爱着它
She loved it.

227
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,050
从壁画
From the murals...

228
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,860
玻璃工艺品  一直到桌布和餐巾
the glasswork, all the way down to the table linens.

229
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,570
不忽视任何细节
No fine point was overlooked.

230
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,000
这是她的遗产
This was her legacy.

231
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,730
我的家族现在声名狼藉
My family's in tatters,

232
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:56,190
都是因为响尾蛇  见鬼
and it's all because of Diamondback. Shit!

233
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,890
我知道  我知道
I know, I know...

234
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,800
我知道我得走出这里
I need to get out in front of this.

235
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,310
发表一篇声明关于达蒙·布恩的声明
Release a statement about Damon Boone

236
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,850
以示尊重
and how much I respected him.

237
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,090
这不是我想说的
That is not what I was gonna say.

238
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:13,200
只是  拜托  别再演讲了
Well, yeah, just-- Please, no lectures.

239
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,410
这只是一个房子
This is just a thing.

240
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,740
房子可以重新盖  当你盖好的时候
Things can be rebuilt, and when you do,

241
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,870
它就是你的遗产了
you rebuild it as your legacy.

242
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,920
不只是酒吧
Not just the clubs.

243
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,130
我想真正参与进来
I want to be a part of that.

244
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,740
我是这样想的
Here's what I think.

245
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,280
控制舆论是重中之重
Controlling the narrative is everything.

246
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,540
我们不能有任何的潜在威胁
We can't have any loose threads.

247
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,090
所以任何可能在这里听到
So anyone who might have overheard

248
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:47,920
你和响尾蛇以及沙兹对话的人
anything you said to Diamondback or Shades in here...

249
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,660
都是威胁
is a threat.

250
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,770
完全正确
You're absolutely correct.

251
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,880
我能为你做点什么
How may I be of service?

252
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,760
我不想你惹上任何的麻烦
I wouldn't want you to do anything untoward.

253
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,650
绝对不会
Never.

254
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:09,780
好的
Okay.

255
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,950
我没时间管这个
I don't have time for this.

256
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:41,750
不要动
Don't move.

257
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,230
他会打爆你的头  他已经疯了
He'll blow your head off. He's crazy like that.

258
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,600
别想着反抗
Don't try no shit.

259
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,270
我的错  麦斯  我听着武当故事长大的
My bad, Meth. I grew up on that Wu-Tang shit.

260
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,620
-但是你知道那感觉的  -你还是认真的吗
- But you know how it is. - Are you serious?

261
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,170
你真的想这时候和我谈吗
Are you really trying to have a conversation right now?

262
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:00,410
我只是想说  你是一个...
I'm just tryin'... I'm just sayin'... You're the man...

263
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,180
戴上面具
Pull your mask down!

264
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,990
你应该去看门的  布莱斯
You supposed to be watchin' the damn door, Bryce!

265
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:05,010
叫我真名的事情上我是怎么说的  迈克尔
What I say about using my government name, Michael?

266
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:08,470
见鬼  伙计
Damn, homie.

267
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,080
你看起来像从乳酪磨碎器里走出来的
You look like you went through a cheese grater.

268
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,500
天哪  你是卢克
Oh, snap, you Luke--

269
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:19,690
我不是故意的
I ain't mean that.

270
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,010
把你的电话给我
Give me your phone.

271
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,310
电话  蠢货
The phone, fool.

272
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,480
我的错  伙计
Yo, my bad, man.

273
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,950
你知道的  看你把我伙计打飞的时候
You know, I just got a little nervous and shit

274
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,410
我有点紧张
when you threw my mans across the-- -

277
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,490
不  伙计  是你啊

278
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,000
我以前特别喜欢《PLO风格》
Yo, man, "P.L.O. Style" was my joint back in the day.

279
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,790
耶稣上帝啊
Sweet Christmas.

280
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:50,880
伙计 等一下
Yeah, man, one second.

Hey. It's me.

282
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,810
他们会找我
Yeah, they'll be looking for me.

283
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,950
我会小心活动  过会见你
I'll lay in the cut. I'll see you in a few.

284
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:10,960
你是加大码的吗
You a double XL?

285
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,310
早就想到了  伙计
Way ahead of you, homie,

给警察打电话
Call the cops.

287

288
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,220
愿意出钱保护你
who would pay you for this kind of protection.

289
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,720
钱他们可以留着
They can keep their money.

290
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:35,840
再见
Salute.

291
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,960
你之前见过这种事情吗
You ever see anything like that before?

292
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,660
哈莱姆  小子
Harlem, baby.

293
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,800
这就是哈莱姆
Harlem.

294
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,750
-你好  -奈特警探

这是谁的号码

297
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,200
我从便利店买的预付费电话
A prepaid phone I picked up from CVS.

298
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,880
我要见你一面

299
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,390
-来分局  -不行  不行

300
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,820
你见过玛莉娅找到那个律师
You saw how quickly Mariah sent that lawyer

301
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,120
把我弄出去有多快
and got me out of there.

302
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,440
你之前不想和我谈的
You didn't wanna talk to me before.

303
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,230
是什么让你现在相信我了
What makes you trust me now?

304
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,070
因为卢克·凯奇的所作所为
Because Luke Cage does.

305
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:19,600
他救了我  你也看穿我了
He saved my life. And you saw right through me.

306
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,750
-你想知道真相  对吗  -你在哪里
- You want the truth, right? - Where are you?

307
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,800
-听着  如果你帮不上忙  -坎迪斯
- Look, if you can't help... - Candace.

308

告诉我一个地址  我会过去
Tell me a place, and I will be there.

309
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:37,430
你本该去雷克斯的  但我把你留下
You should be at Rikers right now, but I held you...

310
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,380
因为我觉得你有话要说
because I think you have something to say.

311
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,500
律师
Lawyer.

312
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,140
我看过你的记录  阿尔瓦雷斯先生
I know your record, Mr. Alvarez.

313
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:49,860
90年代末的时候来到哈莱姆
Came up in Harlem,

314
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,110
一直跟着水腹蛇
rolled around with Cottonmouth in the late '90s,

315
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,140
在斯波福德和纽约州新新监狱待过
spent some time at Spofford, Sing Sing,

316
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,890
然后你犯了大事  被送去海门监狱
then you made it to the big time, went to Seagate.

317
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,320
律师
Lawyer.

318
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:06,200
康奈尔·斯托克斯死了  但你却还活着
Cornell Stokes is dead, but you're still alive.

319
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,810
我从没见过这么快的传讯
And I've never seen an arraignment happen so quickly.

320
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,550
200万美元的保释金
Two million dollar bail...

321
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,410
还是有人付的现金
and someone paid it in cash.

322
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:17,610
谁是你的新赞助人  是威利斯·斯崔克吗
Who's your new sponsor? Is it Willis Stryker?

323
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,570
我要
Law...

324
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:21,690
律师
...yer.

325
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,890
你涉及劫持人质事件  埃尔南
You were part of a hostage situation, Hernan.

326
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,200
即便你的律师真能把你弄出去
Even if your lawyer does get you out...

327
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,450
你也跑不了
you won't be walking away from that.

328
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:37,550
你将面临多起绑架和持械的起诉
That's multiple kidnapping and weapons charges.

329
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:41,330
25年监禁听起来这么样  最少这个数
How does 25 years to life sound to you? Minimum.

330
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,350
你说真的吗
Are you serious?

331
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,650
真的
Yep.

332
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:50,990
好吧
Okay.

333
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:55,850
好吧
Okay.

334
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,680
我当时在俱乐部

336
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,320
我知道是谁干的
I know who did it.

337
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,070

00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,570
我们可以保护你  但我要一个能核实的名字
We can protect you, but I need a name to verify.

339
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,540

340
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,550
是斯崔克吗
Was it Stryker?

341
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,790
他的名字是
He goes by...

342
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,880
律师
lawyer.

343
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,600
要我拼出来吗
You need me to spell it?

344
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,700
-你管这叫安全  -这里很空旷
- You call this safe? - We're hiding in plain sight.

345
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,550
我罩着你呢  暂时而已
I've got you. For now.

346
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,730
坎迪斯  再骗我一次
Lie to me again, Candace,

347
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,550
我就离开  你就只能靠你自己了
I walk away from here, and you are on your own.

348
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,440
-这可不是胡扯的  -等着瞧吧
- It's not bullshit. - We'll see.

349
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,110
你怎么离开哈莱姆天堂的
How did you even get out of Harlem's Paradise

350
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,550
居然没人拦你
without being stopped?

351
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:18,090
他们忙着逮捕卢克  我就直接走了
They were so busy trying to arrest Luke, I just walked away.

352
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,120
到底什么事
So what is it?

353
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,950
你要告诉我什么重要的事
What do you need to tell me that's so important?

354
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:30,760
水腹蛇死的那晚我在俱乐部
I was at the club the night Cottonmouth died.

355
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,750
我已经知道了
I already know that.

356
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,840
我是说就在他死后
I mean right after.

357
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,520
玛莉娅杀了他
Mariah killed him.

358
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,230
你身上的衣服扔到垃圾袋里
The trash bag is for the clothes you're wearing now.

359
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:09,370
所有衣服都扔掉  包括珠宝
Every stitch goes in. Jewelry, too.

360
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,540
斯珀洛克会把它们烧掉
Someone from Spurlock's will incinerate them.

361
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,830
好谎言的秘诀就是
The secret to any good lie

362
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,460
要跟真相没有交集
is it has to run parallel to the truth.

363
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,540
你怎么知道的
How do you know this?

364
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,160
他们说话的时候我听到了
I heard them talking about it.

365
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,790
照我说的做
Do what I say.

366
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:26,800
那个总戴着墨镜的人  他也在场
The guy who always wears sunglasses, he was there.

367
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:32,830
栽赃卢克·凯奇杀了水腹蛇是他的主意
It was his idea to say Luke Cage killed Cottonmouth.

368
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,580
我吓坏了
I was so scared.

369
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,270
我溜了出去  回到了储物柜那边
I snuck out of there, back to the lockers.

370
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:49,350
我试着冷静下来
And, um, I was trying to calm myself down.

371
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,860
我上去后  戴眼镜那人
When I went upstairs, the guy with the glasses

372
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,600
给我了五万块让我说个故事
offered me $50,000 to tell a story.

373
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,100
所以我就说了
So I told one.

374
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,610
-你现在为何要承认  -因为我良心过不去
- Why are you coming clean now? - 'Cause I can't live with this.

375
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:07,050
尤其是卢克还救了我的命
Especially after Luke saving my life.

376
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:11,060
如果你们能保证我的安全
If you can guarantee my safety,

377
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:14,200
我愿意作证把刚才说的再说一次
I will testify about everything I just told you.

378
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,700
玛莉娅比水腹蛇更让我害怕
Mariah scares me more than Cottonmouth.

379
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,230
我问过她是否觉得是卢克干的
I asked her if she thought Luke did it,

380
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,030
主要想看看我能不能信任她
mostly to see if I could trust her.

381
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,960
想看看她会不会跟我说实话
To see if she would tell me the truth.

382
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:42,800
她直视着我的眼睛  说
She looked me right in my eye and said...

383
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,410
"你永远不知道一个人能做出什么事"
"You never know what anyone is capable of."

384
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,200
重点是她说那话的语气
It was the way she said it.

385
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:55,570
要是她知道我跟你聊过  她会杀了我
She... she would kill me if she knew I was speaking to you.

386
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:57,170
我真的相信她会
I truly believe that.

387
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,040
谢谢你肯帮我
Thank you for helping me.

388
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,950
我会钉死玛莉娅·迪拉德的
I'm gonna nail Mariah Dillard's ass to the wall.

389
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:14,510
-还有谁知道你来了  -只有我朋友莱斯利
- Who else knows that you're here? - Just my friend Leslie.

390
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,780
别打给任何人  包括莱斯利
Don't call anyone else, not even Leslie.

391
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,920
不行  把你的电话给我
As a matter of fact, give me your phone.

392
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,140
快点
Come on.

393
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,250
好吧  这是我在路上买的
Okay. Now, I picked this up...

394
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:31,530
以防万一
on the way, just in case.

395
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,780
我已经把我的电话输进去了
It's already got my number programed in there,

396
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:37,590
如果我打来或者发短信  你会知道是我
so if I call or text, you know it's me.

397
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,990
你的胳膊还好吗
Is your arm okay?

398
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,970
我扣扳机的手指没问题
My trigger finger is just fine.

399
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:49,120
走吧  我们走
Come on, let's go.

400
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,120
-去哪  -索莱达家
- Where? - Soledad's.

401
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,380
她女儿克莱尔
Her daughter Claire

402
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,890
就是在哈莱姆天堂帮你治疗脚踝的人

403
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,200
她也在那里
She'll be there, too.

404
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,680
我亲自送你过去
I'm gonna take you there myself.

405
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,410
不骗你  当时子弹满天飞
No lie. Bullets was flying everywhere and shit.

406
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:19,250
你想告诉我
You trying to tell me

407
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:22,660
这些是弹孔吗
that those are bullet holes?

408
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,930
麦斯  我爱你  但麻烦你赶紧滚
Man, Meth, I love you, but get out of here.

409
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:26,300
我不相信
I... I don't believe that.

410
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,840
HB  我之前也跟你想得一样
HB, I thought the same thing...

411
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:33,480
直到那矮个子开了枪  打中了凯奇两枪
until shorty pulled the biscuit and let two off on Cage

412
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,050
结果弹飞了
and they bounced off.

413
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,760
子弹就那么弹开了
Bullets ricochetin' and shit.

414
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,460
听着  我说的是实话
Look, I'm telling y'all the truth.

415
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,270
我看到你们的表情了  你们不信
I see y'all over there, y'all don't believe it.

416
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,570
相信我  是真的
Trust me, it's the truth.

417
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:44,390
他把这些哥们的枪打掉后
And after he smacked fire out these dudes,

418
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:47,930
他留下了帽衫  让我和戈麦斯报警
he left the hoodie, told me and Gomez to call the police.

419
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,630
你知道我不会报警的  然后他就走了
You know I ain't calling no po-po. Then he bounced.

420
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:52,820
-说你保证  -我保证  真的  我跟你说
- Say word. - Word, Sway. I'm telling you.

421
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,870
他甚至把那人的枪卷成了球  就像手工作业
He even balled the dude's gun up like some old homework.

422
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,870
但我的问题是  如果他是无辜的
But my thing is, though, if he innocent,

423
00:27:58,870 --> 00:27:59,970
那为什么要逃跑
so what he running for?

424
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,310
刀枪不入几乎跟身为黑人一样容易被误解
Bulletproof always gonna come second to being black.

425
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:06,120
HB  你该知道的  你是泽西州的  泽西啊
HB, you should know that. You from Jers. Jers!

426
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,040
看来他对你的出身很吃惊啊
Sound like he stunted on you right there.

427
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,410
他惊呆了  真的惊呆了  真的
He did stunt. It was a stunt. It was a stunt.

428
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:11,850
你为什么对我惊呆了
Why you gotta stunt on me? -

429
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:12,970
不  我是说真的
No, I mean, seriously.

430
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:16,430
说真的  我是说  如果是我...
Seriously, though, what I'm just saying, like, if that was me...

431
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,500
-对  -我在逃亡
- Right. - And I was on the run.

432
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,820
为什么还要插手
Why even get involved?

433
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,450
但他还是站出来了
But he did.

434
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,290
那些家伙可紧张了  任何事都有可能发生
And those dudes was nervous, so anything could've happened.

435
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:29,970
在我看来  卢克·凯奇救了我的命
As far as I'm concerned, Luke Cage saved my life, man.

436
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,410
就是这样  伙计
That's what's up, man.

437
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:34,740
我觉得他可不像什么杀警察的人
You know what, that don't sound like no cop killer to me.

438
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,900
真的  真的
For real, for real.

439
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:41,200
看到一个黑人  刀枪不入
You know, there's somethin' powerful about seeing a black man

440
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:44,090
无所畏惧是很有冲击力的事
that's bulletproof and unafraid.

441
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,390
-你们知道吗  -是啊  是啊
- Come on, y'all. You know? - Yeah, yeah.

442
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,610
街头大爱凯奇
Streets got mad love for Cage.

443
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:50,820
我也大爱凯奇  他是我们的人
I got mad love for Cage, man, and... and he one of ours.

444
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,840
是啊  但你知道吗
Yeah, yeah. But you know what?

445
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,710
我们也大爱你
We got mad love for you, too.

446
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:56,460
-绝对的  -你也是我们的人
- No doubt. - You one of ours, man.

447
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,820
节目快结束了  你要给我们来几句吗
You know, the show's almost over, man. You gonna spit for us?

448
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,670
-当然了  -他要来几句了
- Of course. - Oh, man! He 'bout to spit!

449
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:03,840
听众们  迎接听觉盛宴吧
Citizens, you are in for a treat.

450
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,730
最好的歌手之一  唯一的马瑟曼
One of the best to pick up the mic, the one and only Method Man!

451
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,020
准备好了吗
Hey, yo, Sway. You all ready?

452
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,170
我要将这首歌
I'mma dedicate this one to

453
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:13,760
献给街头最强壮的猛汉
the hardest individual on the street right now.

454
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,690
卢克·凯奇  你早就知道了
Luke Cage, you already know.

455
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:18,640
"刀枪不入的爱"  哥们  开始吧
"Bulletproof Love" Your way, brother. Let's get it.

456
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,250

*Before he pound you with the grip*

470
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,790
*Lord, who to call When no one obeys the law*

471
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,560
*And there ain't no Iron Man That can come and save us all?*

472
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,690
*Power to the people And Luke Cage the cause*

473
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:00,570
*And the cops got it wrong We don't think Cage involved*

474
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,800
* Look, dog, a hero, never had one*

*When the hood got your back, dog Bulletproof love *

490
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:43,890
为了老爹  安息吧  兄弟
Shout out to Pop. RIP, my brother.

491
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:46,450
街头已经疯了  你知道我在说什么
The streets is crazy right now, you know what I'm sayin'?

492
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:49,600
人们说我们不再需要英雄了  但现在你出现了
People say we don't need another hero, but now we got one.

493
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,410
不管你喜不喜欢  卢克·凯奇  请相信
Whether you like it or not, Luke Cage, please believe it, sir,

494
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:55,260
街头是你的后盾
the streets got your back.

495
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,790
你已经有刀枪不入的爱  宝贝
You're already bulletproof love, baby!

496
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:00,620
真洗脑  这里是《摇摆大学》
Yeah! That was dope. You got it right here on Sway's Universe.

497
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:04,890
马瑟曼哥们  HB和刀枪不入的爱  卢克·凯奇
The homie, Method Man, HB, and the bulletproof thug, Luke Cage.

498
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:07,990
执法部门全力搜索卢克·凯奇
Law enforcement is in a frenzy looking for Luke Cage.

499
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:09,820
街头出现很多假冒者
There have been numerous false sightings,

500
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,080
有些人穿着带弹孔的连帽衫
with some people wearing hoodies with holes

501
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,750
弹孔英雄
有些人穿着带弹孔的连帽衫
with some people wearing hoodies with holes

502
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,460
从而声援这名罪犯
as a sign of solidarity with
弹孔英雄

503
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:18,420
很多人仍然认为他是一名英雄
an outlaw some people still perceive to be a hero.
弹孔英雄

504
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:18,510
弹孔英雄

505
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,840
清晨摇摆  有什么话要说  朋友
Sway in the Morning. What's on your mind, citizen?

506
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:24,810
我还记得当年拉瑞·戴维斯逃亡的时候
Yo, I remember when Larry Davis was on the run back in the day.

507
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:27,220
警察到处找他  因为他们
Cops came at him 'cause they were just as corrupt,

508
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,100
跟他一样腐败  危险  肮脏
dangerous and jacked up as he was.

509
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:29,500
老爹理发店
跟他一样腐败  危险  肮脏
dangerous and jacked up as he was.

510
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,270
我真的觉得我们现在
I don't think we're getting
老爹理发店

511
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,870
并不清楚卢克·凯奇事件的全貌
the full story on Luke Cage yet, for real.
老爹理发店

512
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:33,440
并不清楚卢克·凯奇事件的全貌
the full story on Luke Cage yet, for real.

513
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,470
我可不会信政府这一套
I wouldn't put it past the government, man.

514
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,540
我们会为你们寻找答案
You know, we're gonna be searching for the answers for you,

515
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,010
我们一得知真相
and once we get the facts,

516
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,850
就会在《摇摆大学》中公布
we're gonna put it right here on Sway's Universe, all right?

517
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:45,720
谢谢你们的来电  又有人打进来了
Thanks for your call, citizen. We got another person on the line.

518
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,840
快点
Now. Come on! All right.

519
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,930
得了吧  你们知道他不在这里
Oh, come on, man. You know he's not here.

520
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,400
和电脑玩我还能理解
I understand playing against the computer,

521
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,780
但你要怎么打败你自己呢
but, um, how do you beat yourself?

522
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,620
象棋讲究预知
Chess is a game of anticipation.

523
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,070
如果你知道每一种可能的走法
If you know every single possible move,

524
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:19,910
你能抢在你对手之前预知他的下法
you can anticipate your adversary's next move before he does.

525
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,190
真深奥
That's deep.

526
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,670
如果我们发现你藏匿他  你可吃不了兜着走
If we find out you've been hiding him, there'll be hell to pay.

527
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:28,020
出去的时候不要弄断
Yeah, well, just don't break the hinges

528
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,850
门上的铰链
on that door on your way out.

529
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,580
我才刚修好
I just got it fixed.

530
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:10,840
真是惊险[剃得不好]
That was a close shave.

531
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,900
这双关真差
Bad pun.

532
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,600
你到底为什么要回来
What the hell did you even come back for, man?

533
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,860
我必须回来
I had to.

534
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,570
为了哈莱姆
For Harlem.

535
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,210
我得在响尾蛇毁掉大家的家园前除掉他
Take care of Diamondback before he made it bad for everybody.

536
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:28,280
忘了哈莱姆  忘了你哥
Well, forget Harlem. Forget your brother!

537
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:32,530
你和一个那么漂亮的女人坐上新车上了路
You're on the road in a brand new car and a woman that fine?

538
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:34,350
你还刀枪不入
And you're bulletproof.

539
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,490
我要是你就永不现身
You'd have never seen my black ass again.

540
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:39,560
偶尔抢个银行  永不回头
I'd rob the occasional bank and never look back.

541
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,850
城里所有的警察都在找你  伙计
You got every cop in the city looking for you, brother.

542
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,930
黑鬼们还在写什么卢克·凯奇的叙事歌
Negroes writing Luke Cage ballads and shit.

543
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:55,350
你是怎么打算的
So... what's the plan?

544
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:00,020
把所有玩家都围起来
To box in all the players.

545
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,560
好吧
Well...

546
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,320
沙兹进了监狱
Shades is in jail.

547
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:12,090
玛莉娅是自由身  但她可不会站在你这边
Mariah's out, but she ain't exactly on your side.

548
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,470
你可以跟踪他们两个
Now you could tail both of 'em,

549
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,580
但不知道要等上多久
but no telling how long

550
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:17,200
他们才会把你引到你的猎物那
that'll take for them to lead you to your prey.

551
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:22,820
米丝蒂呢
What about Misty?

552
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,290
不行  她已经自顾不暇了
No, she's got her hands full already.

553
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,250
她一边试着在分局帮我洗清罪名
She's trying to clear my name inside the precinct

554
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:29,400
一边试着抓我进去
and bring me in at the same time.

555
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:31,030
我们得小心应对她
We gotta be careful with her.

556
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,720
那你只剩下一个选择了
That leaves you one other option.

557
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:38,010
另找一个能找到响尾蛇的人
Someone else to find Diamondback.

558
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,740
给
Here.

559
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:43,590
特科
Turk.

560
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:47,430
特科或许是个小卒  但他不蠢
Turk may be a pawn, but he's not dumb.

561
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:49,600
如果他认为自己被算计了就会消失
If he thinks he's being set up, he'll disappear.

562
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,340
这你就交给我吧
You let me worry about that.

563
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:56,460
特科  是我  波比
Hey, Turk, it's Bobby.

564
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,210
我或许能搞到
Listen, I might be able to get my hands

565
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:00,230
差不多30双乔丹球鞋
on about 30 pairs of Jordans.

566
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:03,420
是老款的飞人乔丹五代球鞋
They're the vintage Air Jordan 5s.

567
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,720
你就当我是大街上捡的吧
Let's just say they fell off the back of a truck.

568
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:08,920
好  什么时候
Okay, when?

569
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:19,720
这是谁
Who's this?

570
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,110
姓律名师
First name Law, last name Yer.

571
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,130
你的人脉肯定很广
Must be pretty damn connected

572
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:27,410
来辩护你的律师你自己都不认识
to get a lawyer and not even know who she is.

573
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,400
会员自然有特权
Membership has its privileges.

574
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,550
他保你出来了
He sprung you?

575
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:44,200
你觉得这很好笑  是不是
You think this is funny, don't you?

576
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,070
你早就设计好了吧
You got this all figured out, huh?

577
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,170
不
No...

578
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,480
其实我也不清楚
Actually, I don't.

579
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,280
响尾蛇为什么雇新人
When did Diamondback bring in new hires?

580
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,820
在俱乐部那件事后  他需要做点改变
Well, after the club, he had to change things up.

581
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,930
招募些新面孔
Recruit some new faces.

582
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,520
我打赌你被关起来的时候
I bet while you were inside,

583
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,960
条子们也试图招募你来着
cops tried to do some recruiting of their own.

584
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:49,650
永远不许质疑我的忠诚
Don't ever question my loyalty.

585
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:10,250
他在楼上吗
The man upstairs?

586
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,120
你问题还真多
You are just full of questions.

587
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:16,320
事实上
Matter of fact...

588
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,080
我们去顶层
Let's go to the penthouse.

589
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,210
我只是照吩咐办事
I was just following orders!

590
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:39,910
你就他妈是个傀儡
You're a goddamn puppet.

591
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,370
是谁吩咐你的
Who gave you the order?

592
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,740
是谁
Who?

593
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,170
是响尾蛇
Diamondback!

594
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:58,550
你忘了自己的位置了  问了太多问题
You stopped playing your position. Asked too many questions.

595
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:01,290
响尾蛇说得把你处理掉
Diamondback said you needed to be dealt with.

596
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,760
罗密欧肯定会以你为耻
Romeo would be ashamed of you.

597
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:11,030
你真令人失望
You're such a disappointment.

598
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:13,790
你是今天第二个这么对我说的人
You're the second person who told me that today.

599
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:17,750
我自有担当  沙兹
I'm my own man, Shades.

600
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,740
你自己去对他说吧
Tell him yourself.

601
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:50,980
赞
Nice.

602
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,980
抱歉  罗密欧  我不得不干掉他
Sorry, Romeo... He had to go.

603
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,860
幸好她朋友莱斯利知道她在哪
It's a good thing her friend Leslie knew where she was.

604
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,780
我很高兴你找到了那座公园
I'm glad you found the park.

605
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,270
她现在在哪
So where is she now?

606
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:13,320
她和奈特警探一起离开了
She left with Detective Knight.

607
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,890
路况一糟我就跟丢了她
Traffic got thick and I lost them.

608
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:17,210
抱歉  我不习惯做这种事
I'm sorry. I'm not used to doing anything like this.

609
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:18,590
我们会再找到她的
We'll find her again.

610
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,000
知道她不值得信任已经很有帮助了
Just knowing that she can't be trusted is helpful.

611
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,230
你做得很好  亚历克斯
You did a good job, Alex.

612
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:26,580
我就靠你了
Hey, you're my rock!

613
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,000
晚点见
Later.

614
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,520
你想怎么样
What do you want?

615
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:48,820
那可不是和商业伙伴该有的说话方式
That's no way to speak to a business partner.

616
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:51,370
你对我的俱乐部做出那种事
After what you did to my club,

617
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:53,880
你真的认为我还会与你同流合污吗
do you really think I'm gonna shuck and jive with you?

618
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:56,010
你最好改善一下态度
You might wanna check your attitude.

619
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,650
如果你不能为我所用
If you're not of any use to me,

620
00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:00,000
那你对所有人而言都没用了
then you're not useful to anyone.

621
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:04,110
沙兹可以证明  如果他还活着的话
Shades would tell you, if he was still alive.

622
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,670
你到底在说些什么
What the hell are you talking about?

623
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,520
我不得不处理掉他
I had to let him go.

624
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,230
现在  我给你个机会向我证明你的立场
So now, I'm giving you the chance to tell me where you stand.

625
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:17,000
我除掉了沙兹和达蒙·布恩
I've taken Shades and Damon Boone off the table

626
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,570
好让你展开手脚
so you can grow.

627
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:21,270
我不希望我们也分道扬镳
I'd hate for us to part, too.

628
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,780
我本来也不怎么喜欢沙兹
I wasn't particularly fond of Shades...

629
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:31,280
而达蒙·布恩的死  虽说不必要
and the death of Damon Boone, although unnecessary,

630
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:33,240
我仍很感激
was appreciated.

631
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,400
但你需要明白这点
But you need to know this.

632
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,820
我退出政治游戏了
I'm out of the political game.

633
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:42,070
我的全部精力都放在哈莱姆天堂因上
I'm focusing on Harlem's Paradise.

634
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,920
用它作为
Using it for a...

635
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:48,590
促进社区关系的基地
a power base for community relations.

636
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:51,490
这一招英明
That's a smart move.

637
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,800
但你也使过不少昏招
But you've made some dumb ones also.

638
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:57,350
你永远不该在开放线路上谈起谋杀案
You should never talk about murder on an open line.

639
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,760
打开它
Open it.

640
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:23,790
种子基金  给你的新哈莱姆复兴计划
Seed money... for your New Harlem Renaissance project

641
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:26,110
并且翻修酒吧
and refurbishing the club.

642
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,470
我很抱歉
My apologies.

643
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:32,390
你的捐赠很慷慨
It's a very generous donation...

644
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:35,450
但世上没有免费的午餐
but nothing in this world is free.

645
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:36,560
你说得对
You're right.

646
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:42,740
我唯一的要求就是忠心耿耿
My only condition is loyalty.

647
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:47,440
跟随我  你可以随心所欲地重建哈莱姆
Stick with me and Harlem will be remade in your own image.

648
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,370
以后的日子都是我们的
We'll be doing this for years to come.

649
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,720
我已经控制整个哈莱姆了
Harlem is already in my image.

650
00:42:57,990 --> 00:42:59,180
你要留下吗
You staying?

651
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:03,270
我解决了卡尔我就会消失的
Once I'm finished with Carl, I'll evaporate.

652
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:05,190
但是不要担心
But don't worry.

653
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:09,080
你偶尔会还会感觉到阵阵凉意
You'll still feel the occasional cool breeze.

654
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,800
好梦  玛莉娅
Sweet dreams, Mariah.

655
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,110
你出卖了奇科
You ratted out Chico.

656
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:49,070
你让老爹被杀
You got Pop killed.

657
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,240
兄弟  字写在了墙上
Man, the writing was on the wall.

658
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:54,570
可能有人看到了  就像我一样
Somebody would have seen him. Might as well be me.

659
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,380
我怎么会知道托尼会朝理发店开枪
How was I supposed to know Tone was gonna shoot up the shop?

660
00:43:57,630 --> 00:44:01,000
谁都知道老爹的店永远是净土
Whole damn world know Pop's was Switzerland. Forever.

661
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,040
我应该揍死你
I should crush you.

662
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,060
可是你不会的  你需要我
You won't, though. You need me.

663
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,010
响尾蛇在哪里
Where's Diamondback?

664
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:09,560
我不知道
I don't know--

665
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:13,360
我操
What the--

666
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:18,500
你还不说吗
You still stalling?

667
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:24,680
好吧
All right! All right!

668
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:27,310
他在哈莱姆河旁边的一个仓库里
He's at a warehouse by the Harlem River.

669
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:29,360
在145街旁边  好了吧
Near 145th, all right?

670
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:34,910
我告诉你需要信息了  把我放出来
I gave you what you wanted! Now let me out!

671
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,770
坐稳了  巴雷特
Sit tight, Mr. Barrett.

672
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,770
明天垃圾车会把你捡出来的
Trash pickup is tomorrow.

673
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,850
里面空气不错  还有吃的呢
You can breathe just fine. There's food in there, too.

674
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,960
你不能把我扔在这里
You can't leave me in here!

675
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:51,170
我孩子还要换尿布呢
There's baby diapers in here, man!

676
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:55,680
求你了
Come on!

677
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:25,090
看来你口味不如以前了
Looks like you downgraded.

678
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:28,020
我更喜欢俱乐部一点
I liked the club better.

679
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,750
我是一个需要自己的空间的人
I'm a man who needs his space.

680
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:34,900
空间充裕是好的
Space is a good thing.

681
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:38,340
尤其是你要杀人的时候
Especially when you come to kill a man.

682
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,230
有人干掉了奇普和他两个哥们儿
Someone did your boy Zip and his two homies.

683
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,030
这不是凯奇的作风
That's not Cage's style...

684
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:59,080
所以我猜沙兹不领你保释他的情啊
so I'm guessing Shades didn't appreciate you bailing him out.

685
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:10,640
多明戈  你知道当一只响尾蛇面临危险的时候
You know when a rattlesnake is at its most dangerous, Domingo?

686
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,190
被逼到绝路的时候
When it's cornered.

687
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:44,030
我要打爆你的脑袋
I'm gonna rip your head off!

688
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:19,940
"我就看见一匹苍白的马
"And behold a pale horse...

689
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:24,710
他骑在马上  他的名字叫做死亡"
and he that sat upon him, his name was death."

690
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:15,200
你真的需要一套安保系统
You really need a security system.

691
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:19,840
-你在等我吗  -没有
- You waiting for me? - No.

692
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:23,350
我打赌他跟你说我死了
I bet he told you I was dead.

693
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:28,220
响尾蛇找到过你  对吗
Diamondback got to you, didn't he?

694
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:31,010
不  他没有
No, he didn't.

695
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:38,190
你拿着枪干什么  你不会这样的
What are you doing with a gun? It's not you.

696
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:39,370
闭嘴
Shut up.

697
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:45,610
我给你带了点东西
I have something for you.

698
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,140
我猜
Figured...

699
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:56,960
你会喜欢的
you'd want this.

700
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:05,140
上面有你的指纹和康奈尔的血
Your prints... Cornell's blood.

701
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:14,790
那你就没有可以勒索我的东西了
Then you'll have nothing to blackmail me with.

702
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,170
我不需要了
I don't need it.

703
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:19,910
我们现在是盟友了
We're in this together now.

704
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:28,310
历尽千辛万苦我们终于能够合作
You and I have come a long way.

705
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:32,740
有的时候不经历风雨就
You know, sometimes you have to reach across the aisle

706
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:34,450
不能见彩虹
to get things done.

707
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:38,280
你是指卢克·凯奇吗
You're talking about Luke Cage?

708
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:43,700
我们两个人的想法真是接近的不可思议
It's incredible... how much you and I think alike.

709
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:46,900
我们还在战争中
We're at war.

710
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:52,400
现在  敌人的敌人就是朋友
And right now, the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

711
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:56,850
也许吧  但是这也说不准
Maybe. But it might not take.

712
00:49:57,610 --> 00:50:00,590
你揍过他  还给了他超能力
You did beat his ass and give him his powers.

713
00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:01,490
而且
And...

714
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,600
康奈尔的手下杀死了他爸爸
Cornell's flunky killed Pop.

715
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,850
你真的觉得他会加入
You think he really is gonna jump?

716
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:07,860
加入到我们的阵营吗
Just jump on our bandwagon?

717
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:09,250
当然
Absolutely.

718
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:13,570
因为我们有他最想要的东西
'Cause we have something that he wants more than anything.

719
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:18,280
他的过去
His old life.

720
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:22,330
一个洗刷冤屈的机会  就在这里
A chance to clear his name. Right here.

721
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:30,430
如果我们让卢克和响尾蛇自相残杀
If we send Luke after Diamondback and they kill each other...

722
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,260
问题就全部解决了
all of our problems are swept away.

723
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,860
不管谁赢了
No matter who wins.

724
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:37,630
也许结果会更好
Even better.

725
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,420
我就知道你会来的
I should've known you'd turn up.

726
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:47,520
这里他妈的发生了什么
What the hell happened here?

727
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:50,630
响尾蛇
Diamondback.

728
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:25,040
这个贱人
Sweet sister.

729
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:46,090
慢一点
Slow.

730
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:48,810
放松
Take it easy.

731
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:52,350
他用了什么武器
What did he use?

732
00:52:53,290 --> 00:52:54,980
响尾蛇怎么做到的
How did Diamondback do that?

733
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:58,760
我从来没见过的武器
Something I've never seen before.

734
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:03,100
就连你也无法阻止他
Even you can't stop him.

735
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:21,440
这是刚拿到的照片
These just came in.

736
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:24,960
又是一堆被打得七荤八素的人
Elephant punches all over again.

737
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,320
这又是凯奇做的  对吧
That's gotta be Cage, right?

738
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,680
-喂  -你好  是我
- Hello? - Hey, it's me.

739
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,520
你们发现了多明戈吗
You guys find Domingo?

740
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:41,540
-发现了  -来见我
- Yeah. - Meet me.

741
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:42,510
在哪里
Where?

742
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,560
我应该为此谢谢你吗
Should I thank you for this?

743
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:11,750
所有的线索都指向了响尾蛇
All credit goes to Diamondback.

744
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:14,200
我不觉得我们能找到他
I don't suppose we'll find his body.

745
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:15,560
不过我们找到了奇普的尸体
We found Zip's, though,

746
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,690
还在一幢旧楼里找到另外两名同伙的尸体
and two other thugs in an old building.

747
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:20,920
被枪杀  就在他们接走你另一个伙计之后
Shot up. Right after they picked up your other boy.

748
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,830
沙兹
Shades.

749
00:54:24,850 --> 00:54:26,920
你难道不厌倦眼睁睁看着他们逃走吗
Don't you ever get tired of people getting out?

750
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:28,770
是的
Yes.

751
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,940
你在这里不安全
Look, it's not safe for you to be here.

752
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:34,500
如果你找不到响尾蛇
If you don't find Diamondback--

753
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:38,170
那他就赢了  我将永远生活在地狱
Then he wins, and my life is forever a living hell.

754
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,970
我有什么能帮你的吗
Is there anything I can do?

755
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,340
看看特科知道什么
See what else Turk knows.

756
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:47,250
他在123街小巷的垃圾桶里
He's in a Dumpster in an alley on 123rd.

757
00:54:47,290 --> 00:54:49,130
就在芒特奥利弗特教堂和那家店边上
Near Mount Olivet and the shop.

758
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:52,180
垃圾桶
A Dumpster?

759
00:55:06,910 --> 00:55:09,240
就算我们能稳住响尾蛇
Even if we handle Diamondback...

760
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:13,480
他也不会原谅我们把水腹蛇的死嫁祸给他
he's not gonna forgive us for framing him for Cornell's death.

761
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,700
这个很容易搞定
We could hurdle that easy.

762
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,330
唯一知道酒吧里真相的人只有
The only people who know what really happened in the club

763
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:21,620
你和我
are you and me.

764
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:27,350
我下半辈子都会为那晚发生的事而后悔
I'll regret that night for the rest of my life.

765
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,590
你迫不得已
You did what you had to do.

766
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:31,450
你不该后悔
You shouldn't regret that.

767
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:36,950
你那天在酒吧干什么
What were you even doing at the club that night?

768
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:43,880
我是想去那里杀他的
I was going there to kill him.

769
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:47,640
你抢先了一步
You beat me to it.

770
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:55,670
康奈尔从来不需要我的政治资金
Cornell never needed my political money.

771
00:55:56,290 --> 00:55:58,780
他从来没打算还
And he was never going to pay it back.

772
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:04,800
他只是想控制住我
He just wanted me in all the way.

773
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:07,500
你有什么打算
So what are you saying?

774
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:16,520
他在我身上看到...我这辈子都拒绝承认的东西
He saw things in me... that I avoided my whole life.

775
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:23,950
现在我要变成  他严重的那个我
Now I am becoming that person he always saw...

776
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,010
我一直否认的我
and I always denied.

777
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:34,900
你准备好了吗
You ready?

778
00:56:36,870 --> 00:56:38,710
我准备好了  宝贝
I stay ready, baby.

779
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:07,370
我应该穿着外套  地狱真是冷极了
I should've kept my coat on. Hell just froze over.

780
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:10,800
-卢克·凯奇在哪  -我在这里
- Where's Luke Cage? - I'm right here.

781
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:15,060
-我们有问题  -我也是
- We have a problem. - So do I.

782
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:17,770
我没法决定要先干掉你们中的哪一个
I can't decide which one of you I'm gonna knock out first.

783
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,450
-响尾蛇在哪  -我不知道
- Where's Diamondback? - I don't know.

784
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:23,980
我们三个之间的和谈更为重要
The parley between the three of us is more important.

785
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,950
你还敢说这种话
You have the nerve to use that term?

786
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:28,650
在这里  老爹死的地方
Right here? Where Pop died?

787
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:31,130
说出响尾蛇的藏身地
Cough up Diamondback's location,

788
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:33,470
否则我就跟在海门一样碾碎你们
or I'll stomp you like we were back at Seagate.

789
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:35,410
卢克  冷静点  哥们
Luke, be cool, brother.

790
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:38,230
没人要碾碎别人
No one needs to stomp anyone.

791
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:41,020
老爹把这个地方称为瑞士有他的理由
Pops made this place Switzerland for a reason.

792
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,460
凯奇  我们有共同的敌人
Cage, we have a mutual enemy,

793
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:45,240
能扳倒他唯一的办法
and the only way to bring him down

794
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,220
就是我们齐心协力
is for us all to come together.

795
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:49,220
我绝对不会帮你的
There's no way I'm helping you.

796
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,370
我们是来讲和的
We came to offer you a truce.

797
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:54,850
作为帮你找到响尾蛇的交换
In exchange for helping you find Diamondback,

798
00:57:54,850 --> 00:57:56,440
你放下跟我们之间的恩怨
you drop your beef with us.

799
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,440
你们俩嫁祸我杀人
You both framed me for murder.

800
00:57:58,700 --> 00:57:59,840
你给我什么条件
There's nothing you can offer me

801
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:02,030
都没法一笔勾销
that's going to make me let that go.

802
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:05,030
你的自由呢
How about your freedom?

803
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:06,280
这里有能用来
Right here is everything you need

804
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:07,520
卢卡斯
这里有能用来
Right here is everything you need

805
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:08,970
这里有能用来
Right here is everything you need

806
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:12,380
证明响尾蛇陷害卡尔·卢卡斯的一切
to prove that Diamondback framed Carl Lucas.

807
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:24,630
就算免去了卡尔·卢卡斯的罪...
Even if Carl Lucas is exonerated...

808
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:28,200
卢克·凯奇现在正因杀害水腹蛇而被通缉
Luke Cage is now wanted for the murder of Cottonmouth.

809
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,850
我会告诉他们真相
I'll tell them the truth.

810
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:33,350
响尾蛇杀了康奈尔和达蒙·布恩
Diamondback killed Cornell and Damon Boone.

811
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:35,250
你就自由了
You'll go free.

812
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:38,510
怎么回事
What the hell is this?

813
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:41,350
玛莉娅·迪拉德  你因涉嫌
Mariah Dillard, you're under arrest

814
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:42,950
杀害康奈尔·斯托克斯而被捕了
for the murder of Cornell Stokes.

815
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:44,630
我不是叫你去找特科吗
I thought you said you were going after Turk?

816
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:46,310
你打电话来后我一直在追踪你
I've been tracking you since you called.

817
00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:48,650
我可不会让你又这么消失
