00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:03,990
Whoo!

00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,940
Give Me Some More Of That.

3
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,620
Hope That's My Passion Red.

4
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,670
Beautiful Canvas.

5
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,380
It's Cold.

6
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,090
What Are You Writing?

7
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:52,940
I Got To Get That.

8
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,580
Zack,Give Me The Phone.

9
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,080
Ah,It's Probably A Wrong Number.

10
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,050
Come On. Get The Cuff Key.

11
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,850
How Did You Get This Scar?

12
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,470
Give Me The Phone, Man. I'M
A Cop. It Could Be Important.

13
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,310
Cop? Shit.

14
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:07,090
Zack. Zack,Come On, Man.
What Are You Doing?

15
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:08,640
Sorry. I Don't Do Cops.

16
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,380
-  Oh,I Was Kidding.
- That's Not Funny.

17
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,840
I'm Not A Cop, I'm A
Secretary At A Law Firm,

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,300

- Who's Zack?
- Oh,Perfect.

47
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:15,890
And What's His Signature Doing There?

48
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,620
Earl... Help Me Out Of These Cuffs.

49
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,330
Wish I Could,Grace,But I Can't.

50
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,870

You Can Teach Me A
Lesson Some Other Time.

56
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,250
Right Now... I Got To Get To Work.

00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,000
Yep.

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,190
Sure Gonna Be Nice Having
You In One Place For A While.

61
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,500
So,What You Want To Talk About?

62
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,520
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

63
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,800
You Already Removed The Body?

64
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,380
Yes,I Already Removed The Body.

65
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,340
Uh,Male Victim. Hard To Tell What Age.

66
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,150
Yeah,Hard To Tell.

67
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,960
Squatter Found Him By
That Door. Didn't See Much.

68
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,100
Shit! Jesus Christ.

69
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,140
Didn't See Much Except You
Jumping Out Of Your Boots,Cowboy!

70
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,100
Sparrow Seen Flying From The
Scene! We Got An A.B.B On Him!

71
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,830
All-Bird Bulletin. Got To Be Careful.
Suspects Could Be Watching Us.

72
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,020
What? They Made Me Do It.

73
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,780
I'm Serious,Man. Get That
Thing Out Of There. Get It Out!

74
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,340
Were You Attacked By A Small
Bird When You Were Little?

75
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,150
No,I Just Don't Like Small
Birds. Okay? Don't Do That,Henry.

76
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,500
And I Didn't Bust Your Frigging
Vince Young Bobblehead,Yo.

77
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,420
Hey,I Dusted The Pieces Yesterday. I Found Two Sets Of Prints
- You And Grace.

78
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,690
Oh,Must Have Been The Time I
Tried To Shove It Up Your Ass.

79
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:40,140
Ohh! U.S.C. Title-Game Night
You Cried Like A Little Bitch!

80
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,540
- Where's Grace?
- Where Is Grace?

81
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,900
She Got Tied Up.

82
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,800
Okay. I've Got Blood Away
From The Victim Over Here,

83
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,020
Which Usually Means
The Killer Cut Himself,

84
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,260
But That's Written In Blood.

85
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,110
Drops Could Be Spillage From That.

86
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,850
She Was Tortured.

87
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,500
Yeah. These Slash Marks
- None Of Them Are Fatal.

88
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,140
The Killer Spent Some Time Hurting Her.

89
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,880
They're All Over Her Face And Shoulders.

90
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,150
She Hasn't Been Dead Very
Long. Rigor Hasn't Fully Set In.

91
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,060
Lots Of Anger,Stabbing -

92
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,100
Usually A Person -

93
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,560
But This "Evil" Shit On The Wall...

94
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,010
Looks Like A Purse Dump.

95
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,490
Any I.D.?

96
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,150
No.

97
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,800
Purses Always Get To Me.

98
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,100
I Think About My Sisters.

99
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,320
Check It Out. She Worries
About Money,Bad Breath,

100
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,610
Smokes Pot - Chocolate
For The Munchies -

101
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,400
Goes To Bars.

102
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,490
Beer Cantina.

103
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,890
Hey,Ham! Beer Cantina.

104
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,390
Isn't That Where You And
Darleen Spent Your Honeymoon?

105
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,350
Handwritten Numbers.

106
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,370
Looks Like Seven Of Them.
Could Be A Phone Number.

107
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,520
<I>Seven Smudged Numbers.</I>

108
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,410
Good Thing You Go To Church,Rhetta.

109
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,990
It'll Take A Miracle To Decipher That.

110
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,530
So,Grace Is Where? She's
Gonna Want To See This.

111
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,700
Yeah,I Imagine She Would.

112
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,620
* Apples And Hay And Grain

113
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,070
I Left You A Message On
Your Cell. Where Are You?

114
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,830
You Need To See This
Crime Scene. It's Brutal.

115
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,490
I Hope Everything's Okay. Call Me.

116
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,120
And Why Is Ham Being So Pissy?

117
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,680
- Earl?
- Yep.

118
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,370
Are You Eating Something?

119
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,370
I Had To Go To The Middle East.

120
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,420
I Got A Hankering For
Some Of Mustoua's Bbleh.

121
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,210
Caught Him Right Before
He Closed Up Shop.

122
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:59,970
Okay. Look. I Admit I Messed Up.

123
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,510
Could Use A Little More Lemon.

124
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,640
You Must Be Getting Awful Hungry.

125
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,440
Open Wide.

126
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,850
What
- What Is This Crap?

127
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,930
Best Tabbouleh On The Planet.

128
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,940
<I>Well,This Planet.</I>

129
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,170
They Got Some Good
Tabbouleh On Paxtibar -

130
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:26,670
Little Planet About A Trillion
Zillion Miles From Earth.

131
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,680
Paxtibarians Take Great
Pride In Their Tabbouleh -

132
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,790
Kind Of Like You Guys And Oil.

133
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,080
Are You Finished?

134
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,340
- With My Tabbouleh?
- Look,I Learned My Lesson.

135
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,540
Uh-Huh.

136
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,240
In Your Head,That Means, Next
Time,You Hold The Cuff Key.

137
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,190
What Do You Want,Earl?

138
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,100
What Do I Have To Do To
Get Out Of These Things?

139
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,520
Start Leading A Different Life?

140
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,060
Buy Self-Releasable Handcuffs?

141
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,800
Ugh!

142
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,530
I Need To Get To Work.

143
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:54,630
Yes,You Do.

144
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:57,380
So Unlock These Handcuffs
So I Can Go To Work.

145
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,360
<I>Well,You're Talking About Your Job.</I>

146
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,180
<I>I'm Talking About Your Life</I>

147
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,780
And The Work You Need To Do On It.

148
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,050
You Got To Get Ready,Grace.

149
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:04,960
For What?

150
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,710
For Whatever Plan God Has For You.

151
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,310
I'm Ready,Okay? I'm Ready!

152
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,430
I Don't Know About That,My Girl.

153
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,380
Want To Watch Tv?

154
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,730
Oprah's On.

155
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,380
Cause Of Death Was A Sliced Aorta.

156
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,190
There's No Sign Of Sexual Assault.

157
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,760
Anything Distinctive About The Knife?

158
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,450
A Switchblade,3,Maybe 4 Inches Long.
Bobby's Trying To Track It Down.

159
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,880
- Victim Have A Name?
- Not Yet.

160
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,660
There's Nothing In Missing Persons,
And We Can't Put Out A Picture.

161
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:34,130
Look,She Was Wearing,Uh,This Necklace.

162
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,760
Bobby And Butch Canvassing The Area?

163
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,960
- Yes,Ma'am.
- What About Grace?

164
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,550
I Don't Know.

165
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,440
You Don't Know Where Your
Partner Is? Has She Checked In?

166
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,600
I Think It Was Family
Stuff. I'm Sure She's Fine.

167
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,560
Did You Speak To Her? Where Is She?

168
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,910
<I>- She's Home - I
Think. - You Think?</I>

169
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,850
Bobby? Go By Grace's
House. Make Sure She's Okay.

170
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,030
Lost My Favorite T-Shirt On That Bet.

171
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:05,680
It Had A Picture Of Golda Meir,Pre
-'67,

172
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,810
Embroidered On The Pocket.

173
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,170
I Knew I Should Have Taken The Over,

174
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:14,740
But I Always Been A
Sucker For The Underdog.

175
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,920
It Goes With The Territory,I Guess.

176
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,550
Well,Who Ever Heard Of A
War Lasting Only Six Days?

177
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,680
Please Answer The Phone,Earl.

178
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,560
Can't. Boss Doesn't Like
Us Doing Phone Surveillance.

179
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,400
Sure Would Make Life Easier.

180
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,480
Hey,It's Doug. Need To
Talk To You About Clay.

181
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,070
You Are Not Going To Believe
What Your Favorite Nephew Did.

182
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:39,030
Here's A Hint
- He's Grounded Until Thanksgiving.

183
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,180
Call Me.

184
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,500
I'd Like To Be A Fly
On The Wall For That -

185
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,380
You Talking To A Kid About
Something He's Done Wrong.

186
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,680
Earl,Take Your Damn Wings And
Flap Your Smart Ass Back To Egypt.

187
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:54,000
And While You're There,Tell
Mustafa His Tabbouleh Sucks.

188
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,110
Oh,Shit.

189
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,690
Grace.

190
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,150
This Is The Third Time I've Called You.

191
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:03,340
You're Either Dead Or
Someplace With Earl,So Call Me.

192
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,930
And Oh,Oh,Oh.

193
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,460
If You're On A Trip With Earl...

194
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,250
Bring Me Home A Surprise.

195
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,030
I Think I'm Onto Something.

196
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,550
Doug? Call Me,Man.

197
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:18,060
Grounded Till Thanksgiving? What
Did Clay Do? Wear A Longhorn T-Shirt?

198
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,920
- Hey,Luke!
- Hanadarko,Baby. Where's My 5 Bucks?

199
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,600
Shit,Man. You Cheated.

200
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,510
You Can't Get In On A Bet At Half Time.

201
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,190
Why Not? You Always Do.

202
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,180
Coroner's Office Took
The Body A Few Hours Ago.

203
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:33,360
You Know,For A Coroner,Henry
Sure Has Been Happy Lately.

204
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,550
Run It Down For Me.

205
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:39,050
Nude Female,Maybe 25. Hard To Tell
- Her Face Was So Cut Up.

206
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:42,160
Found By A Squatter Last
Night Around 2:00 A.M.

207
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,780
Watch Your Step.

208
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,840
Looks Like Somebody Didn't
Like Their Cornbread And Beans.

209
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,210
I Got It From Here.

210
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:56,830
You Buying Me A Pitcher Of
Beer At Louie's,Hanadarko.

211
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,530
Ha!

212
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,970
Devil

213
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,200
Hey. Is Everything Okay?

214
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,400
- Bad Morning.
- I Called You Three Times.

215
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,980
I Know. I-I Brought You
Something To Say I'm Sorry.

216
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,610
What Is It?

217
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,810
Hey,Doug.

218
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,370
Yeah,I'll Be Here.

219
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,960
Okay,Man. I'll See You Then.

220
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,880
Whew! He Is Really Upset
With Clay About Something.

221
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,010
Is This A Duck?

222
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,210
Whittled By Earl.

223
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,430
- Earl Whittles?
- Yeah.

224
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,850
He's Not Exactly Channeling
Michelangelo,Is He?

225
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,410
I Also Brought... This.

226
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,870
Earl Drinks While He Whittles.

227
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,860
Our Warehouse Jane Doe -

228
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,380
Bottle's From A Similar Case.

229
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:01,040
Did You Stop By The Crime Scene? The
Blood On The Wall Is The Victim's.

230
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,550
What Case Is This?

231
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:05,160
Why Doesn't It Have
An Evidence Tag On It?

232
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,270
Grace!

233
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,120
Oh,No. Forget It.

234
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,180
I Didn't Steal It. I Got 100% Legally.

235
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,180
Somebody's Already Dusted It For Prints.

236
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,360
Maybe You Could Get Dna
Off The Mouth Of The Bottle.

237
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,130
You Think You Know This Guy.

238
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,350
Why Is All The Earl Shit Out?

239
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,440
Don't Change The Subject.

240
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,920
I'll Tell You When I Piece It Together.

241
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,030
The Earl Shit
- What Are You Doing?

242
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,030
Theorizing.

243
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,670
About How To Get Rid Of Him,I Hope.

244
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,640
What If All This Stuff Means Something.

245
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,510
What If It's Like A Language -

246
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,840
A Language Of Symbols,A
Language Of Angels.

247
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,820
What If I Sneeze And A 1965
Mustang Comes Flying Out My Butt?

248
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,090
What?

249
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:47,280
Wonder If Earl Has Ever Left
Anything Behind For Leon Cooley.

250
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,900
If He Did,Doesn't Matter.

251
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:53,780
On Death Row,You'd Be Lucky If They
Don't Confiscate Your Used Toilet Paper.

252
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,290
Hey,I May Have A Missing-Persons Match.

253
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:59,250
Guy Coming In, His Daughter's
Description's A Good Fit With Our Victim.

254
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,190
What About The Canvass?

255
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:06,180
Some Grocers Down The Street Saw A Dark
S.U.V. Around Midnight. Didn't See Anyone.

256
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,200
Butch Is Out Shaking
Down One Of His C.I.S.

257
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,070
Why'd The Killer Choose
This Warehouse? Who Owns It?

258
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,120
Japanese Company Who's
Name I Can't Pronounce.

259
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,060
Pork Chop.

260
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:30,890
I Owe You An Apology.

261
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,210
You Owe Your Team An Apology.
Where Were You This Morning?

262
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,450
I Took Some Personal Time.

263
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,110
- Why Didn't You Call In?
- I Should Have.

264
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,420
Why Didn't You?

265
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,090
And Why Shouldn't I Bench Your Ass?

266
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:41,410
I'm Sorry. It Won't Happen Again.

267
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,560
Don't You Dare.

268
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,740
Should I Be Worried About You?

269
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,080
No. I Have Rhetta For That.

270
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,230
This Is Your Friend
Talking,Grace. Should I Be Worried?

271
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,610
It's Just Family Stuff.

272
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,950
God,That's The Same Bullshit
Ham Just Tried To Feed Me.

273
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,170
No Bullshit. My Brother-In-Law's Coming
In. We Got To Talk About My Nephew.

274
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,320
- Really.
- What's Going On With Ham?

275
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,150
What About Him?

276
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,780
Well,He's Pissed At You, And I Don't
Think It's Over Paperwork You Didn't Do.

277
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,520
Whatever Crap Is Going On Off The Job,

278
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,180
That Shit Will Get You Killed
On The Street,So Fix It,Grace,

279
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,260
Or I'm Gonna Reassign
You Both New Partners,

280
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,950
<I>And That Is Not Your Friend Talking.</I>

281
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,900
<I>That's Your Captain.</I>

282
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,540
Whatever You Want To
Say To Me,Ham,Say It.

283
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,860
I'm So Sick Of Your Shit.

284
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,770
What Shit Are You Sick
Of,Ham? Be Specific.

285
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,760
Who The Hell Was That Guy?!
Someone You Met At A Bar?

286
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,770
Grocery Store.

287
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,140
Look,What The Hell Are You Doing?!

288
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,590
What I'm Not Doing Is Explaining
Any Part Of My Life To You.

289
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,350
You Sleep With Every
Guy You Meet,Is That It?

290
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,250
Only The Ones Willing
To Give Me A Ride Home.

291
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,760
You Know,You Can Be Such A Bitch!

292
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,470
Listen,You Judgmental Asshole,

293
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:53,570
You Got Out Of Your Wife's Bed Hoping For
A Quickie Before We Hit The Crime Scene.

294
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,820
I'm Sorry I Wasn't Available.

295
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,590
Mr. Duncan.

296
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,720
Have A Seat.

297
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,810
This Is Ella.

298
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:20,130
We Have Breakfast Every Wednesday
- Pancakes.

299
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:23,010
Anyway,She's Never Been
Late,Let Alone Not Show Up.

300
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,420
You Say You Last Spoke With
Ella Yesterday. What Time?

301
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,800
Around 7:00. I Went Back,And
I Checked My Cellphone.

302
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,120
- If You Go In
- When Was This?

303
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,400
- Last Night.
- What Time Last Night?

304
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,990
I Just Told You.

305
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,000
I'm Sorry. Go Ahead.

306
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,180
Look,My Wife,She Went By
Ella's Apartment And Her Work.

307
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,960
Oh. Her Work,Her Work. She
Works At Mercy Hospital.

308
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,920
She Didn't Show Up Today.

309
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,160
Do You Know If Ella
Had Plans Last Night?

310
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,400
She Was Going Out With Friends.

311
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,040
Did You Speak With Any Of Them Today?

312
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,950
Her Best Friend,Jennifer. She
Hasn't Talked With Ella Either.

313
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:01,380
I Know That I'm Supposed
To Wait 24 Hours,But...

314
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:05,790
But Ella -
Well,This Is -

315
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:09,700
Well,She Wouldn't Do
This. She'd Call Me.

316
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,890
Mr. Duncan...

317
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:16,110
Does This Mean Anything To You,Sir?

318
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,140
Why Do You Have This?

319
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,630
Do You Recognize It?

320
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,190
No. Oh,No.

321
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,810
It's Not The First Time
This Guy's Done This.

322
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,700
He Enjoyed It. You Get
A Look At The Victim?

323
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,490
Yeah. I Got A Hit In
Vicap From 11 Years Ago.

324
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:40,530
You Already Ran It?

325
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:45,260
Happened In Tulsa. Victim Didn't Give Her
Name. Didn't Say Much To The Local Cops.

326
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,670
Anything From Your C.I.?

327
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,530
- We'll See. You Feeling Okay?
- Yeah.

328
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,550
Stopped Back By The Warehouse.
Luke Says You Got Sick.

329
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,180
Fighting A Bug.

330
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,990
How'd You Know To Move The Locker?

331
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:56,530
What Locker?

332
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,240
Looked Behind It.

333
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,060
Thought I Saw Something.

334
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,830
So "Evil" Is Really "Devil"?

335
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:04,650
Yeah.

336
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:05,950
Which M.O. You Run Through Vicap?

337
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,410
Devil.

338
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:11,880
We Got A Probable I.D. On The Victim
- Ella Duncan,24,Physical Therapist.

339
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,160
Went Out With Her Friends Last Night.

340
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,300
- You Got An Address On Her?
-  Dad Had A Key.

341
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,000
Let's Go.

342
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:24,950
- Want Me To -
I'm Gonna Ask -

343
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,510
You Got A Visitor.

344
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,670
Hey.

345
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,380
Where'd You Get This.

346
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,760
The Internet.

347
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,610
Oh,Wow.

348
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:44,180
I Walked In On Clay While
He Was Watching This.

349
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,170
It's His Turn Now.

350
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:47,630
<I>Hey,Claire.</I>

351
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:50,040
<I>You Want A Piece Of Pie?</I>

352
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,260
Ohh.

353
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,390
Do You Believe That?

354
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,800
What'd He Say?

355
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,510
He Was With Friends. They Were Doing It.

356
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,970
Lame Shit.

357
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,380
I Know He Feels Bad About It.

358
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,690
It's Not Like Clay. I Don't Get It.

359
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:10,390
It Could Have Something To Do With Me.

360
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:13,220
- I'm Kind Of Dating Someone.
- Kind Of?

361
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:17,400
Well,Actually,I'm Dating
Someone Kind Of Seriously.

362
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,980
That's Great.

363
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,130
We Ever Gonna Meet Her? What's Her Name?

364
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,080
Lisa.

365
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,420
Last Name? I Want To Run Her.

366
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,370
Okay. Take Your Chances.

367
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,120
No,But You're Gonna Love Her,Grace.

368
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,070
I Mean,She Knows More
About Football Than I Do.

369
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:36,880
She Loves To Bowl,Hunt,Makes Me Laugh,

370
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,340
And She's Smart.

371
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,800
Can't Wait.

372
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,960
You Know She'll Never Take
The Place Of Your Sister.

373
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,790
Shit,Doug. It's Been 12 Years.

374
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:46,180
Mary Frances Has Been
Wondering What Took You So Long.

375
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,980
Well,I
- Seems -

376
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,670
I Think Clay's Having
A Hard Time With It.

377
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:58,400
It Seems Like He Likes
Her,But... I Don't Know.

378
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,970
It's The Only Thing I Can Think Why
My Son's Turning Into Such A Jerk.

379
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:03,900
I'll Talk To Him.

380
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,410
I Want You To Put The
Fear Of God Into Him.

381
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:09,330
I'll Do What Uncle Bud Did To Me
When I Set The Convent On Fire.

382
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:11,000
Uncle Bud The Texas Ranger?

383
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,060
Mm-Hmm.

384
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,710
What'd He Do?

385
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,480
Jennifer,Thanks For Meeting Me.

386
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,920
I'm Sorry I Have To Do This Now,

387
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:29,190
But I Need You To Go
Through Last Night For Me.

388
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,490
It Was Your Birthday?

389
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,530
It's Not Your Fault Your Friend Is Dead.

390
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:36,380
What Do You Want To Know?

391
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:39,530
Everything From The Time You Met
Ella To The Time You Left Her -

392
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:43,410
What You Did,Where You
Were,Who You Talked To.

393
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:45,490
Did Anyone Buy You Drinks?

394
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:48,850
Anyone Go Outside To Smoke
A Cigarette Or A Joint

395
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,140
Or To Get Laid?

396
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:54,590
Nothing You Say Can Surprise
Me Or Get You In Trouble.

397
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:58,560
It Was Your Birthday
- Four Best Friends Out To Party.

398
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,840
I've Been There,Okay? So
Just Be Honest With Me.

399
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:07,600
Uh,We Met At 8:00

400
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,310
At This Restaurant Downtown
- Aunt Sassy's.

401
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,540
Do You Know If He Gave
Ella His Phone Number?

402
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,510
Yeah,Uh,I Saw Him.

403
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,210
He Wrote It On A Matchbook?

404
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,210
No.

405
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:22,320
He Put It In Her
Cellphone,But,Um,There Was Another Guy.

406
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,770
They Were Dancing.

407
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,330
I Think They Went Outside For A While.

408
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,580
How Come They Went Outside?

409
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,150
To Smoke A Joint.

410
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,570
We Were All Pretty Wasted.

411
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:30,800
Ella Talk To Anyone?

412
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,460
This Cute Guy From New York.
He's Visiting His Sister.

413
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,900
He Bought Us Drinks.

414
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,520
You Remember If He Paid
With Cash Or Credit Card?

415
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,530
Cash. He...

416
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,050
Told Us He Never Used Plastic

417
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:46,770
'Cause He Likes The Way
Money Feels In His Pants.

418
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,420
You Know His Name?

419
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,970
Jerry.

420
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:51,880
How Old Is He?

421
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,340
Our Age,Uh... 25 Maybe.

422
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,100
She Wouldn't Have Left With Him.

423
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,210
Even If She Was Drunk?

424
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,490
No Way.

425
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:02,450
Ella May Have Taken His
Phone Number,But All Of Us,

426
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:05,650
We Think It's Crazy To Go Home
With Some Guy You Meet In A Bar.

427
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,980
Maybe. I Mean,She Could Have.

428
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,250
We've Picked Up Guys
Before. We Know It's Stupid.

429
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,060
Let's Go Back To Aunt Sassy's.

430
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:16,120
You Were Having A Good
Time,Drinking A Lot.

431
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,860
You Notice Anybody Else?
Anybody Watching You Guys?

432
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,370
There Was An Older Guy At The Bar.

433
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:24,650
Ella Thought He Was Sexy.
He Was Kind Of Watching Us.

434
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:25,760
How Old?

435
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,300
I Don't Know,40,45.

436
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,950
Will You Work With Us On A Sketch?

437
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,830
Sure.

438
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:35,710
<I>Why The Hell Should I
Talk To You About Anything?</I>

439
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:39,370
I Thought Maybe Because I'm A
Friend Of Detective Hanadarko's.

440
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,690
So What?

441
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:43,430
And Because I Know About Earl.

442
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,140
You Know Shit About Earl.

443
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:48,550
Actually,Mr.
Cooley,Technically,That's Not True.

444
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,720
Mr. Cooley?

445
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,050
What Do You Know About Earl?

446
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:54,870
I Know He's An Angel.

447
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,540
He Your Last-Chance Angel?

448
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,560
No.

449
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,520
You Haven't Met Him?

450
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,800
No,Sir. But I Know He Takes You Places,

451
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,400
And I Was Wondering If You
Ever Come Back With Anything.

452
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,740
A Migraine.

453
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,970
Anything Else?

454
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,110
Why Do You Want To Know?

455
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:12,290
Because Maybe The Things You
Come Back With Mean Something.

456
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:14,750
And How Do You Know That,Cop? You A Cop?

457
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:20,820
No,Sir. I'm A Person Who Believes God
Has Brought Earl To Save My Friend.

458
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,920
Earl's Some...

459
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,400
Heavy-Duty Help.

460
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,810
She Kill Somebody?

461
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:30,250
Just You.

462
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:39,080
Only Thing I Ever Brought
Back I Got With Me Right Here.

463
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:46,670
- You Got A Tattoo With Earl?
-  In Cuba.

464
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,480
"Holy Redeemer." Is That Your Church?

465
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,350
Never Heard Of It.

466
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:53,720
Me And Earl Went Out Drinking.

467
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,400
Couple Mojitos Later,We
Both Get Tattoos.

468
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,200
Earl Has A Tattoo? Where?

469
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,290
Tell Detective Hanadarko To Ask Him.

470
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:09,530
That Way,I Ever See You
Again And You Know The Answer,

471
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:12,190
I'll Know You Ain't Full Of Shit.

472
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,800
Thank You.

473
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:19,920
Till Then,You'll Just Be A Pretty Lady
I Can Spend Some Of My Loneliest Hours...

474
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:23,000
Thinking About.

475
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,270
Friend Of Mine Says He Saw An S.U.V. Last Night
- Maroon.

476
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,930
He Told Me It Was Parked
Outside The Warehouse.

477
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:42,210
Some Dude Was Helping A Girl Puke.

478
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,850
This Friend Get A Description?

479
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:46,210
Yeah. She Was A Hot Blonde.

480
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:49,540
<I>Not Her,Razor
- Of The Dude.</I>

481
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,410
No. It Was Too Dark.

482
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:54,430
Well,This Shit Ain't Worth
50 Bucks And A Tank Of Gas.

483
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:56,340
<I>It Was 60,</I>

484
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,910
<I>And,Uh,This Next Shit Will Be.</I>

485
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,250
My Friend Got The Plate.

486
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,670
Of The S.U.V.?

487
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:03,400
"Kate-Something-2."

488
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,510
What's The Something?

489
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,820
He Thinks A Letter. Maybe A "B."

490
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:11,250
So It's,Like,One Of 22 Letters.

491
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,380
- 26.
- 26?

492
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,180
Pretty Sure.

493
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:18,840
Kate-Something-2.

494
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,020
Good Job,Razor.

495
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,730
- Butchie?
- What?

496
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:25,060
I'm Thinking,How About
Instead Of The Cash,

497
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,880
Then,Um,I Could Go Over To
Your Place And Make You Supper?

498
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,870
And Then I Could Give You A Massage.

499
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:32,780
You Know What I'm Saying?

500
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,820
I'm Afraid I Know Exactly
What You're Saying.

501
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:38,150
This Pans Out,I Owe You A Tank Of Gas.

502
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,090
- When You Gonna Tell Them?
- Tell Them What?

503
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:26,080
Why You Got That Scar On Your Back.

504
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,970
I Can't Tell What I Don't Remember.

505
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:30,710
Well,You Remember Waking
Up With A Sliced Shoulder.

506
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:34,300
You Remember Moving Out Of Your House
A Month Later, Bought This Place.

507
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:38,000
You Ain't Gonna Tell Them.
You Ain't Ready. Get Up,Girl.

508
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,170
- No.
- Rematch.

509
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:41,820
<I>Wrestling. I Win,You Tell Them.</I>

510
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,480
<I>You Win,You Get To Carry
That Secret Long As You Want.</I>

511
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,270
You Cheat.

512
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:48,110
Fine. We'll Do It Your Way,Then. Here.

513
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,120
What The Hell Am I
Supposed To Do With This?

514
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,290
Bang Your Head Against It For
A Couple More Decades,Grace.

515
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:57,870
I Got To Get Back To France.

516
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,020
Shit.

517
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,430
Whatre You Doing Here So Early?

518
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,450
What Are You Doing Here So Early?

519
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:12,730
No,You. What Are You Doing Here?

520
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:14,050
Family Stuff.

521
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,710
Butch.

522
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:28,400
I Didn't Bust Your
Vince Young Bobblehead.

523
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,620
Figure It's Ham.

524
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,320
It's Not Ham.

525
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,210
I'm Not Ever Gonna Know,Am I?

526
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:36,750
If I Figure It Out,I'll Tell You.

527
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,540
I Just Need To Be Careful.

528
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,640
Me Too.

529
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,360
Will I Ever Get Another One?

530
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,590
<I>You Want Another One?</I>

531
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,760
A Guy Can't Ever Get Enough Bobbleheads.

532
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,690
Thanks.

533
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:57,160
I'll Take It From Here.

534
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,160
Take A Seat.

535
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:25,490
Give Me Your Right Arm.

536
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,880
Act Like A Tough Guy...

537
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,060
You Get Treated Like One.

538
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,730
I'm - I'M
- I'm Sorry.

539
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,820
I
- I Know It Was Stupid.

540
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:45,330
I Can Handle Stupid,Clay.
We're All Stupid Sometimes.

541
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,970
What I Can't Handle...

542
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:52,260
<I>Is Mean
- Being Violent.</I>

543
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,610
Aunt Grace?

544
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:56,910
My Name Is Detective Hanadarko.

545
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:02,710
And If You Like Watching
Yourself So Much,Great.

546
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:03,940
Let's Watch.

547
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,200
<I>Hey,Claire.</I>

548
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,590
<I>You Want A Piece Of Pie?</I>

549
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:15,560
That Is Assault,Clay.

550
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,370
Claire Could Press Charges Against You,

551
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:21,360
And You Don't Even Need To Go To Trial
Because The Evidence Is Right Here.

552
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,360
Claire.

553
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,920
That Is Her Name,Isn't It?

554
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,940
Let Me Hear You Say It.

555
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:32,750
Claire.

556
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:36,110
So,What Do You Say We Watch You
Assault Claire A Few More Times?

557
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,530
<I>Hey,Claire.</I>

558
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,930
<I>You Want A Piece Of Pie?</I>

559
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,390
Ready To See It Again?

560
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,730
<I>Hey,Claire.</I>

561
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:50,870
<I>You Want A Piece Of Pie?</I>

562
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,430
Bartender Remembers Jerry From New York.

563
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:59,250
He's Been Coming In
Every Night For A Week.

564
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,480
But Not Last Night? No,I'm
Checking The Airlines.

565
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,370
What About The Older
Guy From Aunt Sassy's?

566
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,480
He Show Up At The Bar?

567
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,340
Yeah,The Bartender Doesn't Remember Him.

568
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,380
Shit!

569
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,060
Retaliation For The,Uh,Vince
Young Bobblehead.

570
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,650
He Thinks I Did It.

571
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:17,680
Guess So.

572
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,080
I Think We Got Something Here.

573
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,550
Remember Those Grocers Saw A
Dark S.U.V. Outside The Warehouse?

574
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:31,890
<I>Butch Has Another Witness Saw A Guy
Near A Maroon S.U.V. Around Midnight,</I>

575
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,750
Helping A Girl Throw Up.

576
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:36,020
<I>How We Doing On The Wrap-Up?</I>

577
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,400
Who's Your Witness,Benny?

578
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,980
Street Kid I've Known For A While.

579
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,790
He Gave Me The Tag
- Kate,Some Letter,And 2.

580
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:46,520
So I Ran Every Letter In The
Alphabet, Found Three That Are Close.

581
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:52,090
Kateb25- A Taurus,Belongs To
A 25-Year-Old Girl,No Record.

582
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:54,830
Katee2
- Woman's Husband Bought A Jag,

583
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:57,270
So She Got One,Too
- No Record.

584
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:02,170
And Kater2
- An S.U.V. Leased To Tolliver Catering.

585
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:05,150
Jeremy Tolliver's The Owner
- No Record.

586
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,640
Jeremy,Jerry.

587
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,640
Could Be The Sketch.

588
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,530
Could Be The Guy's Not
From New York At All.

589
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:12,550
Do We Know Where He Works?

590
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:27,460
He's Got A Catering Truck, Works
The I-35 Industrial Corridor.

591
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,910
Butch And Bobby At His House?

592
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,840
No One's Home. They're
Talking To His Neighbors.

593
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,220
I Don't Think He's Our Guy.

594
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,140
Based On What?

595
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:37,490
The Hit We Got In
Vicap Happened In 1996.

596
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,300
Jeremy Tolliver Was 15.

597
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,060
15-Year-Old Could Have Been In
A Bar, Had A Girl Take Him Home.

598
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:42,930
Doubt It.

599
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:45,950
Look,The Restaurant-Supply Store's
Right Down The Street From The Warehouse.

600
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,650
He Buys Stuff There
For His Catering Truck.

601
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,660
That's How He Knew About It.

602
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,870
Look,I
- If His S.U.V. Was There,

603
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:53,160
We Got To Talk To Him. I Just...

604
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,720
Think We Should Ask Who Else Drives It.

605
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,360
Well,You Got Another Suspect?

606
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,160
Not Yet.

607
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,950
Then What The Hell Do You Have,Grace?

608
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:03,130
Or Is That None Of My Business,Too?

609
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:05,590
And What The Hell's With You?

610
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,540
Detectives?

611
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:12,420
State Trooper Spotted The Catering
Truck. Bobby And Butch Are On Their Way.

612
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,880
This Is The Address.
You Are Their Backup.

613
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,200
Are They Gonna Be Safe?

614
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,080
He Looks Just Like The Other Sketch.

615
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:51,330
Check Out The Orange Apron.

616
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,460
Jeremy Was At The Emergency Room
Last Night. He Burned His Hand.

617
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,200
Think That's His Stepbrother,Scott.

618
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,920
He's Staying With Him
Right Now,Getting A Divorce.

619
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,410
Jeremy Drive His S.U.V.
To The Emergency Room?

620
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:05,000
No,His Wife Drove Him In Her Car.

621
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,780
Ran Down His Employees.

622
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:10,550
His Stepbrother Was Arrested
Five Days Ago. Domestic Abuse -

623
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:13,300
Beat His Wife,Threatened
Her With A Switchblade.

624
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:16,720
Hey,We're Seizing This Truck
In Payment For Back Taxes.

625
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,850
You Want To Step Out?

626
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:20,390
Step Out Of The Truck Now. Come On.

627
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:21,900
Drop It.

628
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,050
Let's Go.

629
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:27,010
Hands Behind Your Back. Spread Them.

630
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:54,190
Illegal Knife. You're Under Arrest.

631
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,120
Come On.

632
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:16,880
What You In For?

633
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,700
Well,You're In The Slammer,You
Must've Done Something Bad.

634
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,990
I -

635
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:28,710
I Pushed A Pie Into A Girl's
Face. Her Name Is Claire.

636
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:32,020
You Always Been Such A Tough Guy?

637
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,680
I Don't Think So.

638
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,200
Why'd You Do It?

639
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,360
I Don't Know,Sir.

640
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,640
Sure You Do.

641
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,320
We Almost Always Know Why We Do Things.

642
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,000
We Just Don't Always
Like Fessing Up To It.

643
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,780
Maybe Because I Wanted To Be Cool.

644
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:50,360
You Ain't The First To Have
That Come Back And Bite You.

645
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:00,530
Who's Taking A Crack At This Guy?

646
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:02,320
I Need To Do It Alone.

647
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,430
Why Alone?

648
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,640
Because I Owe All Of You An Apology.

649
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,710
Get Rhetta For Me,Will You?

650
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:36,110
11 Years Ago,A Girl
Picked You Up In A Bar.

651
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,610
She Took You Home.

652
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,870
You Had Sex.

653
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:44,650
You Took Your Knife And
Cut Her Across The Shoulder.

654
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,820
Do You Remember?

655
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,290
No.

656
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:51,980
Yes,You Do. It Was Your First.

657
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,680
What Happened?

658
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:59,210
Why'd You Leave This?

659
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:02,270
Did You Get Scared?

660
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:04,910
Did You Scare Yourself?

661
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,940
It Wasn't Me.

662
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:10,270
Five Months Later,You Got Married...

663
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:13,990
Hoping A Wife Might
Fix This Urge You Got.

664
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:16,670
But It's Been Simmering,Hasn't It?

665
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,800
All These Years.

666
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,550
And Five Days Ago...

667
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:24,740
It Boiled Over.

668
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:28,010
You Went After Your Wife.

669
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:31,680
And What You Did To Ella Duncan -

670
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,550
You're Not Scared Anymore.

671
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:48,800
Soon As I Saw The Word
"Evil" On The Warehouse Wall,

672
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,590
I Knew There Was A "D" Somewhere Because You
Did The Same Thing In My Bedroom Behind A Door.

673
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,360
What Is This "Evil/Devil"
Bullshit,Scott?

674
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,470
Your Mommy Call You An Evil Little Boy?

675
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:04,070
Call You The Devil?

676
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:07,900
Tell You Women Are Evil?
Especially Women Who Go To Bars?

677
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,250
All I Had To Do...

678
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:13,600
Was Buy You One Drink.

679
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:17,300
Bourbon And Coke. Right?

680
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:23,580
Right.

681
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,810
You Were Drunk When You Walked In.

682
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:31,230
Asked Me To Light Your Cigarette.

683
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,180
We Played Pool.

684
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:41,150
Bending Over To Take Your Shot,
You Stuck Your Ass Right In My Face.

685
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:43,670
Do You Remember?

686
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:45,860
I Don't Remember You.

687
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,340
Where We Met...

688
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,230
How I Got Home -

689
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:58,410
The Whole Night Is A Blackout.

690
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:05,390
Next Day,I Drove To Tulsa,
Got Treatment,Filed A Report.

691
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:09,730
What I Didn't Tell Them Was My Name...

692
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:12,540
...Or That I Was A Cop...

693
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:15,790
Or That You Left A
Beer Bottle At My House.

694
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,750
I Got Your Fingerprints.

695
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:20,280
I Ran Them Every Week.

696
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:24,360
But Until Five Days
Ago,You'd Never Been Arrested.

697
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:29,010
We Found A Fingerprint
In The Warehouse,Too.

698
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,350
You Weren't As Careful As You Thought.

699
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:41,610
She Was A Whore.

700
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,110
Just Like You.

701
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,560
Duck

702
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,010
To Duck To Avoid Panesha

704
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,720
I Want To Tell Claire...

705
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,730
That I'm Really Sorry For What I Did.

706
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:51,730
The Important Thing Is That
We Learn From Our Mistakes.

707
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:01,010
Here You Go,Gus Man.

708
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:13,180
Shit!

709
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,950
Earl!

710
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,470
Remember This?

711
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:19,120
Yes.

712
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,600
Why Are We Back?

713
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,800
I Was Wrong.

714
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,150
<I>You Are Making Progress.</I>

715
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:28,440
Inch At A Time Maybe,But That's Okay.

716
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,550
I'm Proud Of You.

717
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:30,720
You Shouldn't Be.

718
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,480
God Doesn't Sweat The Small Stuff.

719
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,870
This Is The Small Stuff?

720
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:38,180
Well,He Kind Of Works
On A Sliding Scale.

721
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,490
He Let Me Live,But Not Ella Duncan.

722
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:41,620
Why?

723
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,510
I Don't Know.

724
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:45,460
Ask Him.

725
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:50,640
Scott Tolliver Let You
Live,Grace,And Killed Ella.

726
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,960
<I>Ask Him.</I>

727
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:58,900
All I Know Is You Got Big
Things,Big Responsibilities Ahead.

728
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,940
And What You Done Today...

729
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:03,990
Well,It's A
- It's A Big Step,Girl.

Kind Of Makes Me Feel
Like Dancing A Jig.

Shall We?

732
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,150
What Are You Saying?

733
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:14,170
God's Got Plans With Your
Name Written All Over Them.

734
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:17,180
Why Would God Have My Name
On Anything But His Shit List?

735
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:19,820
Better Hang On Tight!

736
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:22,720
Your Life's About To Get A Little Bumpy!
