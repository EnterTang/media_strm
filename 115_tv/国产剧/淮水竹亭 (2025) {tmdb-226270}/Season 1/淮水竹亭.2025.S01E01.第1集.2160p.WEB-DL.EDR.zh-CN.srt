1
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,540
东城梅尔
第一季  第一集

2
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,070
贝蒂・卡罗尔

3
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,380
卡罗尔太太
Mrs. Carroll?

4
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:08,490
出什么事了吗
Is everything all right?

5
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,710
卡罗尔太太  我是梅尔・希安
Mrs. Carroll? It's Mare Sheehan.

6
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,850
我站在你家门口
I'm standing outside your front door.

7
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,390
外面冷死了
In the fucking freezing cold.

8
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:26,390
卡罗尔太太
Mrs. Carroll?

9
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,720
梅尔  梅尔  你在外面吗
Mare? Mare, you out there?

10
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,430
你到了
Oh, you're here.

11
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,020
我到了
I'm here.

12
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,640
我想确保你第一时间知道这事
I wanted to make sure you knew about this right away

13
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:47,620
如果那变态还在逃的话
so the community's safe

14
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,900
社区才能保持安全
in case the pervert is still on the loose.

15
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,490
下次  你打给局里就行
Well, next time, you just call the station.

16
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,960
-你有总局号码吗  -我不记得了
- Do you have the main number? - I don't remember.

19
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,290
但我信任你
But-- but I trust you,

20
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,120
我不知道局里会派谁来
and I don't know who the station will send over.

22
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,410
我明白  但我是警司
I understand, but I'm a detective sergeant,

23
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:07,280
意味着我调查盗窃和吸毒过量
which means I investigate the burglaries and the overdoses

25
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,460
以及这里发生的所有破事
and all the really bad crap that goes on around here.

27
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,610
听上去很糟
Sounds awful.

28
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,840
也许你该考虑换行
Maybe you should look into a different line of work.

29
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,600
找到了  卡罗尔太太  看到没
Here it is, Mrs. Carroll. See this?

31
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,000
这是总局号码
That's the main station number, all right?

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,480
这才是你要拨打的
That's the one you want.

34
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,240
我贴在正中间
I'll put it right in the center.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,350
下次有事就打给他们
So you call them, okay, next time,

37
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,780
而不要吵醒我
instead of waking me up.

38
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:35,330
那是犯罪现场
So, there's the scene of the crime,

39
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,780
你们的术语
as they say in your business.

40
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:39,400
我孙女当时在楼上
My granddaughter was upstairs

41
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,310
准备脱衣洗澡
getting undressed to take a shower

42
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,350
当她看向窗外
when she looked out the window and "Ahh!"

43
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,920
他就在那  他站在那里
There he is. He was standing right out there.

44
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,850
那种偷窥狂
One of those creepy peeper weirdos.

45
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,040
你孙女有说他长什么样吗
Did your granddaughter say anything about him or...

46
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,720
他穿着连帽卫衣
He was wearing a hooded sweatshirt

47
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,640
所以很难看清他的脸
so it was hard to get much of his face,

48
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,610
但从她能看到的来说  他看上去像雪貂
but from what she could see, he looked like a ferret.

49
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,290
-雪貂  -她是这么说的
- A ferret? - That's what she said.

50
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,020
那上面是监控摄像头吗
Is that a security camera up there?

51
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,690
是的  我们三个月前在百思买买的
Oh, yes. We bought that at Best Buy three months ago,

52
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,370
但拖延症先生还没弄明白
but Mr. Procrastinator hasn't figured out

53
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,670
怎么用  惊喜吧
how to use it yet. Big surprise.

54
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,920
你孙女现在在哪
And where is your granddaughter now?

55
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,170
她吓坏了
Oh, she was scared to death,

56
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,470
所以她急忙赶回了阿伦敦
so she hightailed it back to Allentown.

57
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,820
她不想在一只"雪貂"在逃的情况下待在这儿
She didn't wanna stay around here with a ferret on the loose.

58
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,490
好吧  那么
All right. Well, uh,

59
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,920
我会提交一份报告  确保巡逻队知情
I'll file a report and, uh, make sure patrol's aware.

60
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,530
我本来也想走的
I'm half tempted to leave as well,

61
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,250
但我只能去找我在雷德利的妹妹
but then I'd have to go to my sister's place in Ridley,

62
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,470
而她养了猫
and she has cats.

63
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,180
我讨厌猫
Oh, I hate cats.

64
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,050
-我懂  卡罗尔太太  -恶心的动物
- No, I get that, Mrs. Carroll. - They are disgusting animals.

65
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,780
-它们只有骨头  -早  梅尔
- You know, they're all bones. - Good morning, Mare.

66
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,140
-卡罗尔先生  -贝蒂有跟你说
- Mr. Carroll. - Did Betty tell you

67
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,120
今早那个变态的事吗
what happened here this morning with the weirdo?

68
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,310
-当然  -卡罗尔太太给我说了
- Oh, of course. - Mrs. Carroll filled me in.

69
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,020
我当然跟她说了发生了什么
Of course I told her what happened.

70
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,160
你要是当初能琢磨出
The whole case would've been solved

71
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,900
怎么设置监控摄像
if you had been able to figure out

72
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,560
这案子早都破了
how to set up the security camera.

73
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,650
-我跟你说了我今天会弄的  -好了  我要
- I told you I was going to do that today. - All right, I'm gonna...

74
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,910
回局里了  然后提交报告
head back to the station now and file a report.

75
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,800
我们会处理的
We'll take care of it.

76
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,770
梅尔  今晚有重头戏  对吗
Hey, Mare. Big night tonight, huh?

77
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,940
他们在《论坛报》上登了一篇关于你的文章
They did a full article on you in the Tribune.

78
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,890
-你有看吗  -没有
- Did you see it? - Uh, no.

79
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,040
你得看看  梅尔
Oh, you gotta see it, Mare.

80
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,000
-有空吗  -没有
- You got a sec? - I don't, actually.

81
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,230
-等下  -别说了  你去给她拿来
- Just a second. - Well, now, no, just go get it for her, okay?

82
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,590
你不打断他的话  他能说上一整天
You let him, he would talk all day.

83
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,650
贝蒂
Betty!

84
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,200
你把报纸拿去干什么了
What did you do with the paper?

85
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,760
我放在厕所里的
I left it here in the bathroom.

86
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,220
你别走  我马上回来  梅尔
Now you stay right here. I'll be right back, Mare.

87
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:31,480
在哪  你放到哪去了
Where is it? Where did you put it?

88
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,640
拜托  格伦  我需要...
Oh, come on, Glenn. Do I have to...

89
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,950
这周末我会想你的
I'm gonna miss you this weekend.

90
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,730
谁会睡在我身旁
Who's gonna sleep next to me?

91
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:51,690
搂着我  吻我  然后依偎着我
And hold me, and kiss me, and snuggle me?

92
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,210
有时我会想你是否意识到我有多爱你
Sometimes I wonder if you even realize how much I love you.

93
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,080
你外婆过去常说
Your grandmom used to say,

94
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,790
"等你当家长后你就会明白"
"You'll understand when you're a parent."

95
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,680
我心想"嗯  随便了"
And I was always like, "Yeah, whatever."

96
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:14,160
但现在就像  你可以无比爱一个人
But now it's like you can love someone so much,

97
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,850
近乎可怕的感觉
it's scary.

98
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,840
我的天  我会很想你
Oh, my God. I'm gonna miss you so much.

99
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:24,920
好了  该换衣服了
Okay. Let's get you changed.

100
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,630
弗兰克

101
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:58,920
他是在你的车窗上撒尿还是别人的车窗
He's pissing in your car window or someone else's car window?

102
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,630
不不不  待在屋里
No, no, no, no. Just stay in the house.

103
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,740
有警员很快会赶过去
An officer will be there momentarily.

104
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,230
早  简
Morning, Jan.

105
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,600
看了这个没
See this yet?

106
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:12,290
《回忆奇迹发生的时候》

107
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,740
今早《论坛报》刊登了一篇吹捧你的文章大
Big write-up in the Tribune this morning.

108
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,240
我要帮你裱起来  然后挂在你办公室里
I'm gonna frame it for you and hang it up in your office.

109
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,850
拜托别这么做
Yeah. Please don't do that.

110
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,220
请大家热烈欢迎特拉梅尔警官
I want us all to give a very warm welcome to Officer Trammel.

111
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,880
今天是他出勤的第一天
Today is his first day out in the field.

112
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,910
祝你好运  特拉梅尔
Good luck out there, Trammel.

113
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:27,590
谢谢
Thank you.

114
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,630
小乌龟要吃什么

115
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,570
好了  那就开始吧
All right, folks, let get to it.

116
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,190
梅尔  你今天接到了个案子  对吗
Uh, Mare, you had something today, right?

117
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,870
对  格拉布街28号有个徘徊者
Uh, yeah. A prowler at 28 Grubb Road.

118
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:39,050
房主说一个可疑男子今早
Homeowner said a suspicious male was watching from the backyard

119
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,910
在后院偷看她孙女洗澡
as her granddaughter took a shower early this morning.

120
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:44,130
-有外貌描述吗  -有
- You get a description? - Yeah.

121
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,280
我已经抓到了那坏蛋
I already caught the bastard.

122
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,360
他在我女儿卧室的笼子里
He's in a cage in my daughter's bedroom.

123
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,630
好了  咱们赶紧派辆车过去吧
All right, all right. Let's float a car out there

124
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,620
在爱列治街和石榴矿街之间
between Eldridge and Garnet Mine...

125
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:58,990
怎么了
What's up?

126
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,990
今天距离我女儿失踪已经整整一年了
My daughter's been missing for exactly one year today.

127
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,590
失去她的每一秒都是折磨
Every moment without her has been complete torture.

128
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:20,600
母亲要求采取行动

129
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,190
而警方没有采取任何行动
And the police aren't doing anything.

130
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,980
他们根本不在乎  所以我们才会聚集在此
They don't care. That's why we're here.

131
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,600
如果他们不肯尽力去找凯蒂  我们就自己找
If they're not gonna fight to find Katie, we will.

132
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,510
监事会今早又打电话来了
The Board of Commissioners called again this morning

133
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,190
说要加派一个县警探来辅助这个案子
about adding a county detective to assist with the case.

134
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,260
他们希望周一前能对此案
They want a fresh set of eyes on this

135
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,610
-有个全新的视角  -不不不
- by Monday. - No, no, no, no, no.

136
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,770
我不需要什么县里的笨蛋来掺合我的案子
I don't need some county shithead coming on my case.

137
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,540
他们压力很大  梅尔
They're getting pressured, Mare.

138
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:36,880
得了吧  头儿
Oh, come on, Chief.

139
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,900
而由于他们压力很大
And 'cause they're getting pressured,

140
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,910
-我的压力也很大  -头儿  拜托
- I'm getting pressured. - Chief, come on.

141
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,450
你知道这种事是什么回事
You know how this shit goes.

142
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,970
凯蒂・贝里是出了名的瘾君子
Katie Bailey was a known drug abuser

143
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,180
还有当妓女的历史
with a history of prostitution.

144
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,620
她这会可能正躺在
She's probably lying at the bottom

145
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,700
特拉华河的河底呢  我们永远不会知道
of the Delaware River right now. We'd never know.

146
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,900
问题就是我们不知道
The thing is, we don't know.

147
00:07:58,990 --> 00:07:59,920
什么都不知道
Anything.

148
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:01,940
已经一年了
After a year.

149
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,620
多谢你支持我
Thanks for being in my corner.

150
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:11,820
坐下  梅尔
Sit down, Mare.

151
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:19,200
扶轮社把赏金上调到了一万五
The Rotary Club increased the reward money to 15,000.

152
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,250
我们要印新传单
We're printing up new flyers and handing them out

153
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,640
发遍坎登至威尔明顿的每个角落
at every needle exchange from Camden to Wilmington.

154
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,890
回去好好研究卷宗  我们要重新开始
Go back to the file. We're starting over here.

155
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,630
好了
Okay.

156
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,340
-进来吧  -你...
- Hey. Come on in. - Hi. Could you--

157
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,530
你能直接把他给我吗  我...我赶时间
could you just hand him over 'cause I gotta-- I gotta go.

158
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:02,000
外面很冷  起码进屋里站着吧
It's cold out. You can at least stand inside.

159
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,590
我也很高兴见到你  天
It's nice to see you too. Jeez.

160
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,160
好了
Okay.

161
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,730
她怎么来了
What is she doing here?

162
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,750
别操心她来干什么
Don't worry about what she's doing here.

163
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,140
我可没问过你的生活
I don't ask about your life.

164
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,850
我不希望她靠近我儿子  好吗
I don't want her around my son, okay?

165
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,730
我说真的  我都不明白你看上了她哪点
I seriously, like, don't even know what you see in her.

166
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,170
闭嘴吧  艾琳
Oh, just shut up, Erin.

167
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:42,010
迪伦  你忘了这个
Hey, Dylan. You forgot this.

168
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,740
我把他的滴耳剂放在前面口袋里了
I put his ear drops in the front pouch

169
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,200
要是他发烧了记得用
in case he runs a fever.

170
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,870
你最好别在背后议论我  艾琳
You better not be talking about me, Erin.

171
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,990
-我没议论过你  -别再给我男人发短信了
- I haven't said nothing about you. - Stop texting my man.

172
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,140
他已经不想再跟你有任何关系了  好吗
'Cause he doesn't want anything to do with you anymore. Okay?

173
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,620
他是我孩子的父亲
He's the father of my baby,

174
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,880
所以我必须得跟他沟通
so I kind of, like, have to talk to him.

175
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,580
你说什么
What's that?

176
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,800
-你真那么蠢吗  -去你妈的  艾琳
- Are you seriously that stupid? - Fuck you, Erin!

177
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,260
等着瞧吧  有你好受的
You know what? You're gonna get it.

178
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,580
没错  相信我
Yeah. Trust me.

179
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,170
在你最意想不到的时候  傻逼贱货
When you least expect it, you dumb bitch.

180
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,720
求你把车窗关上行吗
Could you please just put the window up?

181
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,920
不  我就不关
No, I'm not gonna fucking put the window up.

182
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,900
布丽安娜  我的天
Brianna, Jesus Christ.

183
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,860
傻逼
Stupid.

184
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,190
我们必须得安排他的耳部手术了
We really need to schedule his ear surgery.

185
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,600
医生说他如果继续感染
The doctor says if he keeps getting infections,

186
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,190
可能会失去听力
he could have hearing loss.

187
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,890
你跟你爸妈说过了吗
Did you talk to your parents?

188
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,210
别把我爸妈扯进来
Don't bring my parents into this.

189
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,220
-他们已经为他做得够多了  -你说过
- They do enough for him already.  - You just said

190
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,520
-你会跟你爸妈说说  -比你爸强多了
- you'd talk to your parents about-- - Way more than your dad.

191
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,290
如果我还得花钱  那就让法院来裁决吧
If I gotta pay more money, it's gotta go through the court.

192
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,930
-我们说好的  -上法院的周期太长了
- That's what we decided. - That's gonna take forever.

193
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,520
咱们先让他把手术做了行吗
I mean, can we just get his surgery done?

194
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,910
-先确保他没事  -我没有一千八百刀的
- Just to make sure that he's okay? - I don't have $1,800

195
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,370
-垫底费  艾琳  -然后我们可以...
- to meet the deductible, Erin! - And then we can--

196
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,000
我跟你说过多少次了
How many times have I told you?

197
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,810
一切都要等法院判决  好吗
Everything needs to go through the court, okay?

198
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:43,510
我得走了
I gotta go.

199
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,750
我想买个...乌龟缸
Yeah, I'm looking for a-- for-- like a turtle tank.

200
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,140
你这儿有装乌龟的缸吗
Do you have, like, a tank for turtles?

201
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,060
有
Yes, we do.

202
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,090
这个怎么样
Um, how about this one?

203
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,190
两栖生活1500型
This is the Amphibian Life 1500.

204
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,210
这个有紫外线加热装置
This one's got a UVB heating kit.

205
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,040
这个很棒
This is a nice one.

206
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,210
-还有...  -我...
- And it's got-- - Yeah, I just--

207
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,570
我只需要个基础款的
I just need something simple, really.

208
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,310
只是只小乌龟
It's a-- it's a-- it's a baby turtle.

209
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:23,360
好吧  那...来这边看看
Okay. Um, all right. Let's take a look over here.

210
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,530
这个  这是绿洲栖息地牌的
This one, this is the Oasis Habitat.

211
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,770
这套也很好
This is another nice setup.

212
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,690
-它也有...  -再基础点吧
- Yeah, it also has-- - I think even simpler.

213
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,370
我觉得那家伙可能活不太长
I doubt the thing's gonna live very long.

214
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,520
会出乎你意料的
Well, you'd be surprised.

215
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,900
我母亲的乌龟活得比她还久
I mean, my mother's turtle outlived her.

216
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,800
如果有人照顾它的话  那是当然
If it's taken care of, sure.

217
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,450
如果能按时喂食  给它换水
If you feed it and give it clean water

218
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,820
确保它没泡在自己的屎尿里
and make sure it's not swimming in his own filth.

219
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,330
是送我孙子的
It's for my grandson.

220
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,050
他才四岁  做事很难专注
He's-- he's four and has trouble focusing on tasks.

221
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,910
我觉得...就来点
I just-- yeah, I don't think we need

222
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,180
外观好看的便宜货就行
all the bells and whistles is all.

223
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,890
你随便看吧  我在前面
Have a look around. I'll be up front.

224
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,270
我是梅尔
This is Mare.

225
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,370
警司  我是特拉梅尔警员
Hey, Sarge, this is, uh, Officer Trammel.

226
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,780
阿格尔大街535号发生了盗窃案
We got a burglary at 535 Argyle Road.

227
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,740
就跟她说是贝丝・汉隆家
Just tell her it's Beth Hanlon's house.

228
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,940
需要你来处理一下现场
Uh, I'm gonna need you out to process the scene.

229
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,480
怎么回事
What happened?

230
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,010
房主回到家  发现收藏柜被砸了
Homeowner came home to find the trophy case smashed

231
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,330
有些运动收藏品不见了
and some sports memorabilia missing.

232
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,460
又是弗雷迪  梅尔
It's Freddie again, Mare.

233
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,110
他改不掉他的混蛋天性
He's being his fucking asshole self.

234
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,790
她觉得可能是他弟弟
She thinks maybe it's her brother.

235
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,570
昨天晚上她发现他在地下室
Um, she caught him in the basement

236
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,460
吸毒  于是把他赶了出去
shooting up last night and threw him out.

237
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:36,960
好吧
All right.

238
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,650
告诉贝丝我这就过去
Tell Beth I'm on my way.

239
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,110
你好
Excuse me.

240
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,920
那个很好
That's perfect.

241
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,930
特价
39.99

242
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,900
弗兰克

243
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,290
梅尔
Hey, Mare.

244
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,010
你今天早上过得如何啊
How's your morning going so far?

245
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:06,670
好极了  我刚刚...
Great. I just, uh...

246
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:11,060
浪费了半个小时
wasted the last half hour picking out an aquarium

247
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,410
给你和德鲁昨天带回家的乌龟找鱼缸呢
for the turtle you and Drew brought home yesterday.

248
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,180
他好像很兴奋啊
He seems excited about it.

249
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,950
我觉得这会对他有好处
I think it'll be good for him, you know?

250
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,690
给他点东西去养护
Give him something to look after.

251
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,400
之前的蜥蜴你也是这么说的
That's what you said about the lizard.

252
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,100
两周后我把它从马桶冲掉了
Two weeks later, I was flushing it down the toilet.

253
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,450
你真的把它从马桶冲掉了
Did you really flush it down the toilet?

254
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:28,070
没错
Yes, I did.

255
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:31,550

- I'm busy, Frank. - Okay. All right.

256
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,270

Uh, look, I won't hold you up. I just, um...

257
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,310
我想告诉你
I wanted to let you know

258
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:39,770
昨晚  菲和我...
that last night, Faye and I-- uh, well...

我爱你  爸爸

271
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,140
别  不用  把枪收起来
No, don't. Put it away.

272
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,810
弗雷迪  小心点
Freddie? Be careful.

273
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,250
弗雷迪
Freddie?

275
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,280
好让我们看看是哪里在流血
so we can get a look at where the blood's coming from.

276
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:15,550
弗雷迪
Freddie?

277
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,000
弗雷迪  别逼我叫警犬过来
Freddie, don't make me call in the K9.

278
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,170
它已经11岁了
He's 11 years old

279
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,090
我觉得它的脑子不太清楚了
and I think his mind's starting to leave him.

280
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,270
弗雷迪  行了
Freddie, come on.

281
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,290
给你两分钟  好吗
You have two minutes, all right?

282
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,230
什么情况
What's the matter?

283
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:50,870
我晕血
The sight of blood.

284
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,750
那就别看啊  别堵着门
Don't look at it, then. Get out of the doorway.

285
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,650
过来坐下  快点过来
Come on. Sit down. Hurry up. Come on.

286
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,000
把头放两腿之间
Put your head between your knees.

287
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,150
用力握拳
Squeeze both your fists.

288
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,730
天啊  也许你在当上警察之前
God. Think maybe you should've thought about that

289
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:04,950
你应该考虑到这一点
before becoming a cop?

290
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,380
我以为我能克服  但...
I just thought it was something I could overcome, but...

291
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:10,990
我的天
Jesus Christ.

292
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,130
深吸气
Breathe in.

293
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,120
梅尔  妈的  你还在外面吗
Mare, goddamn it. You still out there?

294
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,280
继续呼吸
Keep breathing.

295
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,890
-做出决定了吗  -我要出来了
- What'd we decide, Freddie? - I'm coming out.

296
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,230
我不想让那只蠢狗把我家给弄得天翻地覆
I don't want that retarded pooch tearin' up my house.

297
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:28,510
明智  血是从哪里来的
Smart man. Where's the blood coming from?

298
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,120
我把手给弄破了
I cut my fucking hand.

299
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,670
好吧  把手举起来
All right. Put your hands in the air

300
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,610
站得离门远点  我要进来了
and stand back from the door. I'm coming in.

301
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,160
吸气  呼气  吸气
Breathe. In, out. In.

302
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:41,950
妈的  天啊
Oh, fuck. Jesus.

303
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,550
坐下
Sit down.

304
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,430
好了
All right.

305
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,580
-你偷的东西呢  -我偷了什么东西
- Where's the stuff you stole? - What stuff I stole?

306
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,380
你偷的他妈的东西呢
Where's the fucking stuff you stole?

307
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,790
-我偷了什么  梅尔  -天啊  行了吧
- What stuff I stole, Mare? - Jesus Christ, come on.

308
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,520
我们别再扯谎了  我们要叫警犬来了
We're done with the lies. We're calling the K9.

309
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,050
你偷的他妈的东西呢
Where's the fucking stuff you stole?

310
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,350
床后面
Behind the bed.

311
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,920
特拉梅尔  快去看看
Trammel? Come on.

312
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,230
我的老天爷啊
Fucking Jesus Christ's sakes.

313
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,150
你家为什么那么冷啊  弗雷迪
Why is your house so cold, Freddie?

314
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,630
燃气公司给我停了气
Gas company shut me off.

315
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,330
11月到3月期间他们不能关
Well, they're not allowed to between November and March.

316
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,870
我也是这么和那些混蛋说的  但是他们...
That's what I told those motherfuckers but they-- Ow!

317
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:14,990
-天啊  -你个混蛋
- Jesus. Jesus. - Piece of shit!

318
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,130
-行了行了  -你这个嗑药的混账
- All right. All right. - You smackhead dirtbag!

319
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:20,390
行了 行了  好了  我的天啊  行了
All right. All right. All right. Jesus. All right. All right.

320
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,610
把他弄车上去
Get him in the car.

321
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,080
你他妈打我干什么
What the fuck you hitting me for, huh?

322
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,920
-你打我干什么  -好了好了
- What the fuck was that about? - All right. All right.

323
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,240
把他弄车上去
Get him in the car.

324
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,570
-小心头  -行了  贝丝  好了
- Watch your head. - Come on, Beth. Come on.

325
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,140
我没办法...  我没办法再忍受下去了
Oh, I can't-- I can't take it no more, Mare.

326
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,470
没办法了  我没办法再他妈忍下去了
I can't. I can't fucking take it.

327
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,370
没办法了
I can't.

328
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,070
我知道
I know.

329
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,180
他因为这个丢了他妈的工作还有家庭
He fucking lost his job, his family over this shit.

330
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,140
-我了解  -什么时候算是完啊
- I know. I know. - When is it gonna be enough?

331
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,650
对不起  贝丝
I'm sorry, Bethy!

332
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:46,850
对不起
I'm sorry!

333
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:48,890
我没办法了
I can't.

334
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,170
-贝丝  -妈的
- Bethy! - Oh, fuck.

335
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,590
你要提出控告吗
You gonna press charges?

336
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,780
不  我不会...  我不会提出控告
No, I'm not-- I'm not gonna fucking press charges.

337
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,430
屋里没有暖气
There's no heat inside.

338
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,150
他能去你家住吗
Can he stay at your place?

339
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,610
我没办法...  不行
I can't-- no!

340
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,840
他不能住我家
He can't fucking stay at my place.

341
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:17,460
他他妈...  这样吧  我很抱歉
He fuck-- I-- You know what? I-- I'm sorry.

342
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,730
我为自己说这句话而感到羞耻
I'm-- I am ashamed of myself for saying this,

343
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,610
但有时候我真希望他死了
but sometimes I wish he would just fucking die.

344
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:24,570
真的  我真这么想  一了百了
I do. I really do. Just get it over with.

345
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,670
因为我没办法再这样下去了
'Cause I can't do this anymore.

346
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,850
没事的  好吧
It's okay. All right?

347
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:30,870
在这儿等着
Wait here.

348
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,080
好了
All right.

349
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,990
我们要送你去里德尔医院  把手缝合一下
We're gonna take you to Riddle and get your hand stitched up.

350
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,480
然后特拉梅尔警官会送你
Then Officer Trammel's gonna drive you

351
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,520
去庇护所度过周末
to the shelter for the weekend

352
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,850
同时我们想办法恢复你的暖气
while we work on getting your heat turned back on.

353
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,060
我才不要去该死的庇护所住  梅尔
I'm not staying in no fucking shelter, Mare.

354
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:51,100
你妹妹不肯收留你
Well, your sister's not taking you in.

355
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,900
所以你只有两个选择
So your options are...

356
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,210
要么睡在家里  把蛋蛋冻掉
you sleep in the house and freeze your balls off,

357
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,170
要么去庇护所
or you go to the shelter

358
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,920
那里有床有毯子还有热饭吃
with a bed and a blanket and a hot meal.

359
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,160
-好吧  -你这是选择去庇护所
- All right. - All right the shelter,

360
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,340
还是选择冻掉蛋蛋
or all right I'll freeze my balls off?

361
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,330
我会在庇护所过夜  行了吧
All right. I'll stay in the fucking shelter.

362
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,560
老天
Jesus.

363
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,460
带他去找里德尔医院
Take him to Riddle.

364
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,090
然后载他去圣迈克尔教堂
Then drive him to Saint Michael's.

365
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,440
告诉丹・黑斯廷斯神父是我安排他来的
Tell Father Dan Hastings I sent him.

366
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,630
联系佩科燃气公司
And call PECO Gas.

367
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,090
告诉他们这么做是违法的
Let them know they're breaking the law,

368
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,400
除非他们希望我们
and unless they want us to notify

369
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,520
通知公共设施委员会
the Public Utilities Commission on their asses,

370
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,060
否则赶紧恢复他的暖气
they're gonna put his fucking heat back on.

371
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:24,980
知道了  警司
You got it, Sarge.

372
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,850
你还好吗
Hey, you good?

373
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,400
还好
I'm good.

374
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,600
欢迎
Welcome.

375
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,150
我送你回你车上  走吧
I'll walk you back to your car. Come on.

376
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,740
你看  他该死的邻居在看我们
Look, his fucking neighbors looking at us.

377
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,360
没错  微笑挥手吧
Yep. Smile and wave.

378
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,620
爸爸
Hey, dad.

379
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,130
晚饭好了
Dinner's ready.

380
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,210
你今天工作愉快吗
Did you have a good day at work?

381
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,560
真想让你跟我去上班一次
I'd like you to come to work with me once

382
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,390
看你能不能找到愉快的事
to see if you can find anything good about it.

383
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:27,100
布兰登  我们今晚几点碰头

384
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,290
我想问你
Um, I was wondering...

385
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:33,250
我今晚能不能借你的皮卡
if I could maybe borrow your truck tonight?

386
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,220
我和几个朋友要在夏普森林聚会
Some of my friends are meeting at Sharp's,

387
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,430
有车会很方便
and it'd be nice to have it.

388
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,630
你上次借我皮卡发生了什么
What happened last time you borrowed my truck, huh?

389
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:42,890
就是了
Yeah.

390
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,100
事后你还偷偷摸摸的
Then you tried to act all sneaky about it,

391
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,390
好像我不会发现刮痕似的
as if I wasn't gonna fucking notice the scratches.

392
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,450
该死  好烫  艾琳
Ow! Fuck! Aah! Erin!

393
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,580
对不起  我该提醒你的
I'm sorry, I-- I should've told you,

394
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,030
我刚从微波炉拿出来  真抱歉
I just took it out of the microwave. I'm sorry.

395
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,630
你跟那个傻逼说了
Did you talk to shit-for-brains

396
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,120
给孩子治耳朵的事了吗
about getting the kid's ears fixed?

397
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:13,470
说了  他先前来过
Yes. He-- he stopped over earlier

398
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:16,500
他说会付手术钱
and he said that he's gonna pay for the surgery.

399
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,590
他这么说吗
He said that?

400
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:20,920
是的
Yeah.

401
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,140
很好
Good.

402
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,230
因为湿纸巾是我买的
'Cause I'm paying for the wipes.

403
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,860
尿片是我买的  奶粉也是我买的
I'm paying for the diapers. I'm paying for the formula.

404
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,520
-我知道  -都是买给他的儿子  他的儿子
- I know you are-- - All for his son! His son!

405
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:42,450
我知道  迪伦说他会负担医药费
I know. And Dylan said he's gonna take care of it.

406
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,530
我不会再出钱了
I'm not paying for another goddamn thing.

407
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:55,310
布兰登  10点  等不及见你了  亲亲抱抱

408
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:04,530
好的

409
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,710
你看见过我吗  凯蒂・贝里

410
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:40,960
有车
Car!

411
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,410
-噢耶  -你疯了吗
- Cowabunga! - Are you freaking crazy?

412
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,470
你记得你上次从桌上跳下来发生了什么吗
Remember what happened last time you jumped off that table?

413
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,830
-什么  -你头上撞的包跟西柚一样大
- What? - You got a bump on your head the size of a grapefruit.

414
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,380
这是给你的新宠物的
Here, I got this for your new pet.

415
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,210
过来看看
Come on. Check it out.

416
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,590
雪芳会帮你拼起来
Siobhan's gonna help you put it together.

417
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,640
-雪芳  -什么事
- Siobhan? - Yeah?

418
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,930
你能不能帮一下德鲁
Will you help Drew, please?

419
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,850
你是来让我内疚  从而重返教会的吗  丹尼
You here to guilt me into returning to the church again, Danny?

420
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,190
不不不  我早就放弃了
No, no, no, no. I gave up on that a while ago.

421
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,110
你有没有看着他啊
You even watching him out there?

422
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,570
他把那玩意当跳水板一样跳下来
He's jumping off that thing like it's a diving board.

423
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,780
桌子不是跳水板  安德鲁  别跳了
Table's not a diving board, Andrew. Knock it off.

424
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:49,780
该死
Fuck.

425
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,740
你怎么了
What's the matter with you?

426
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,370
弗雷迪又闯进贝丝家了
Freddie broke into Bethy's again.

427
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,300
他今天下午来过庇护所吗
Did he come by the shelter this afternoon?

428
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,550
迪肯・马克确保了他周末能有床位
Deacon Mark made sure he had a bed for the weekend.

429
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,720
可怜的贝丝  真不知道她如何应付的
Poor Bethy. I don't know how she handles it.

430
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,010
她还撑得住吗
How's she holding up?

431
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,810
她妈妈患了帕金森综合征
Well, her mom's got Parkinson's,

432
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:15,720
她哥哥拿她孩子储钱罐里的钱去买镇痛剂
and her brother's smashing her kids' piggy banks to buy Dilaudid.

433
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,520
她应该很疑惑她生命中的上帝在哪
I think she's wondering where the hell God is in her life.

434
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,600
这取决于她对上帝的看法
Depends on what her view of God is.

435
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:24,900
默顿说  "我们所理解的上帝
Merton says that "our idea of God

436
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,070
反映了我们的本性  多于反映
tells us more about ourselves than about...

437
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,450
上帝本身"
Him."

438
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,040
你站在祭坛上对会众布道时
When you're up at the altar preaching to the congregation,

439
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,710
有过没人在听你说话的感觉吗
you ever get the feeling no one's listening?

440
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,040
每天如此
Every single day.

441
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,130
你为什么盛装打扮  妈
What are you all dressed up for anyway, Mom?

442
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,650
你不是不来参加我的典礼吗
I thought you weren't coming to my ceremony?

443
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,150
你早上和弗兰克聊过没
Did-- did you talk to Frank this morning?

444
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:56,510
之前挂了他电话  怎么了
I hung up on him earlier. Why?

445
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:59,360
他邀请我们全家去他家吃烤猪排
Well, he's having us all over for rib roast, you know,

446
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,100
庆祝他和菲订婚
to celebrate his engagement to Faye.

447
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,480
-什么  -我以为他跟你说了
- What? - I thought he told you.

448
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:06,440
他没说
Well, he didn't.

449
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:09,690
你知道多久了
How long have you known about it?

450
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,280
三周吧
Uh, three weeks.

451
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,450
三周
Three weeks?

452
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,660
我是无辜的  我今早才知道的
I'm innocent. I found out this morning.

453
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:19,420
你居然  只字不提
And you didn't-- and you didn't say anything?

454
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,830
-别人的秘密轮不到我说  -你该说的  妈
- Wasn't my secret to share. - Yes, it was, Mom.

455
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,120
我是你的女儿
I'm your daughter.

456
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,960
-海伦  -弗兰克
- Hey, Helen. - Oh, hey, Frank.

00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,920
-进来吧  -我把德鲁的书包拿来了
- Come on in. - I got Drew's bag.

458
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:33,390
你家有牛至吗
Do you, uh, you got any oregano?

459
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,810
你回来了
Oh. You're, uh, you're home.

460
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,930
你有什么想坦白的吗
You have something you wanna confess?

461
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,070
有的
Uh, well, yeah.

462
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,670
我和菲...

你特地告诉我  真有心啊
Nice of you to let me know.

465
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:53,200
我打过几次给你  你没接
Well, I tried calling. A few times.

466
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:54,410
你求婚时有没有单膝跪地
Did you get down on one knee?

467
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,790
我们订婚时你可是跳过了这一步
'Cause you skipped that part when we got engaged.

468
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:59,240
我当年才20岁  梅尔

473
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,920
她都不敢直视我  妈
She can barely look me in the eyes, Mom.

474
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:12,340
我也不愿意直视你  我还是你表弟呢
I won't even look you in the eyes, and I'm your cousin.

475
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,300
干嘛

484
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,010
有那么多空房子可以选
Of all the houses he could move into,

485
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,920
他偏偏买了我家后面那套
he has to buy the one right behind mine.

486
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,380
我听说他买得很划算
Well, I heard he got a really good deal on it.

487
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:51,760
还有  他什么时候开始做饭了
And since when is he a fucking cook?

488
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:55,530
以前没有好女人让他得以展现最好的一面
He just needed a good woman to bring out the best in him.

489
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,060
雪芳

492
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,870
德鲁的学校发来的

Uh, yeah. I'm getting his recorder together now.

495
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,300
他知道怎么吹那玩意儿吗
Does he even know how to play that thing?

496
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,340
雪芳  能帮我一起搭鱼缸吗
Siobhan, can you help me with my fish house?

497
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,790
好  马上  马上来  德鲁

498
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,470
是的  妈妈  他会吹
Yes, Mom. He knows how to play.

499
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:32,140
往里面吹气  然后移动手指
You blow into it and move your fingers

500
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,430
然后扮可爱  他可以的
and look cute. He'll be fine.

501
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:36,010
-雪芳  -等  等一下
- Siobhan! - Uh, just-- just a second.

502
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:37,630
什么事
What?

503
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,800
你知道你父亲和菲的事吗
Did you know about your father and Faye?

504
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,140
是的  妈妈  我知道  我帮他策划了
Yes, Mom, I knew. I helped him plan it.

505
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:48,030
所以大家都会过去吃晚饭
So everyone's having a dinner over there

506
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,740
因为他突然成了大厨
because he's a big cook all of a sudden,

507
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,610
然后没人会来我的典礼  是这样吗
and no one's coming to my ceremony. Is that it?

508
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:54,190
你跟我们说你不想我们去典礼
You told us you didn't want us at the ceremony.

509
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,490
你不记得那晚吃饭时  你说整个仪式
Do you not remember saying how stupid that whole thing was

510
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,650
都非常愚蠢了吗
at dinner the other night?

511
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:05,210

There's a reason I sent you to Gardner Academy.

517
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:20,850
因为我得了个奖学金
Because I got a scholarship?

518
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:23,100
因为那些不曾向我  向你父亲敞开的门
Because doors would be opened that weren't open

519
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,640
现在会向你敞开
for people like your father and I.

520
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,520
爸爸看起来过得不错
Dad seems to be doing fine,

521
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:29,350
尤其是现在他和菲正式订婚了
especially now that he and Faye made it official.

522
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:33,860
把申请信都按时寄出去  好吗
Just get them in on time, all right?

523
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,160
十年  十五年后  当你生活幸福  有工作
Ten, fifteen years from now, when you're happy and employed

524
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,540

- living here with you for the rest of my life. - you will thank me, okay?

526
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,370
所以别再这么拼命把事情搞砸
So quit trying so goddamn hard to screw it up.

527
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:23,740
他挺帅的  对吧
He's cute, right?

528
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,620
他好性感
He's hot.

529
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,120
不好意思  怎么了  他很性感
Sorry. What? He's hot.

530
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,620
你认识他多久了
How long have you even known him?

531
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:34,920
我们来回发短信有大约三周了
Uh, we've been texting back and forth for like three weeks.

532
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:38,500
知道有天晚上他对我说什么吗
You know what he said to me the other night?

533
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:39,880
什么
What?

534
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,300
他说"我想要你重拾舞蹈"
He said, "I want you to dance again."

535
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:49,390
差点让我哭起来
That seriously, like, almost made me start to cry,

536
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,560
因为  你知道我有多想念跳舞
'cause, I mean, you know how much I miss dancing,

537
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,480
那是我和妈妈以前唯一会一起做的一件事
and it was, like, the one thing my mom and I used to do together.

538
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:00,990
-那你去哪里见他呢  -夏普森林
- But where are you meeting him? - Sharp's Woods.

539
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:03,200
认真的吗
Seriously?

540
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:07,830
艾琳  你知道布丽安娜和那些贱人会在那
Erin, you know Brianna and those bitches are gonna be there.

541
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,910
她今天和迪伦一起过来
She came over today with Dylan

542
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,620
然后开始冲我发脾气  说我给他发短信
and started going off on me for texting him.

543
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,880
-你给他发了吗  -没有

544
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,670
可能发了

我希望你能先来找我
I just wish you'd come to me first.

712
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:21,350
这和你无关  梅尔  这关乎能否找到我女儿
This isn't about you, Mare. It's about finding my daughter.

Hey, it's not the right time to have this conversation, okay?

719
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,690
你们可以晚点再谈
You can have it later.

720
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:33,870
而且就算你不停上电视  告诉整个小镇

This isn't about you, Mare. Not everything is.

723
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:38,960
好了  梅尔

现在不是谈这个的时候
It's not the right time for this.

726
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,130
洛瑞・罗斯  你知道我费了多大功夫去找凯蒂
Lori Ross. You know how hard I've worked to find Katie.

727

736
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:04,600

Not to mention the tips I've chased down.

737
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,780

叫来了县里的潜水队...
Brought in the county dive team...

739
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:09,850
