3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,680
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,670
Uh, can-Can we squeeze in here?

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,270
- Oh, perfect.
- Thanks.

6
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,310
Do you realize this is the
first time all three of us

7
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,190
have been in a relationship
at the same time?

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,030
Yeah, they're gonna need to
get a bigger couch in here.

9
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,220
Or maybe you can just
get a smaller ex-husband.

10
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,310
Hey, who's that girl mark's
talking to at the bar?

11
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,770
Her name's katie.They've been together
non-stop for the past couple days.

12
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,740
- He's really into her.
- Aww. Mark thinks he's people.

13
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,900
- The last two days have been fun.
- I know. So fun.

14
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,160
- I really like you.
- Me too.

15
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,810
I wish I liked you just a little more.

16
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,790
- Excuse me?
- I know.I'm so bummed.

17
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,020
Well, maybe I should go.

18
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,880
You should definitely go.

19
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,090
Well, at least we can always
count on mark to be single.

20
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,350
- Dude, what happened?
- You know what they say.

21
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,720
If you're not sure in 48
hours,you gotta pull the rip cord.

22
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,510
Is "they" you, pauly d,and
the situation,by any chance?

23
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:04,640
No.

24
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,700
- You ever heard of mastersofpsychology.net?
- Nope.

25
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,920
Because a guy who's written for them
coined the term "48 hour rule" on his vlog.

26
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,820
He says you know in 48 hours
if someone is right for you,

27
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,830
and if you don't,you're just talking
yourself into it for the hot monkey sex.

28
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,010
And those are his words,not mine.

29
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,930
The 48 hour rule was
true with me and whitney.

30
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,580
No.It took me way longer.

31
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,980
- No way. It was, like,exactly 48 hours.
- You're remembering it wrong.

32
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,760
How do you know? You were bombed.

33
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,820
I was not bombed, okay? She was bombed.

34
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,690
Oh, no, I was more high than bombed.

35
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,980
- I was sober.
- I was drunk.

36
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,990
I hadn't met you guys yet,but I
know what night you're talking about.

37
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,830
- wake up!All right.
- wake up!All right.

38
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:58,750
Okay. Oh, I'm plowed.

39
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,580
You know, this may be
the beer goggles talking,

40
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:04,050
but I think we are the
cutest chicks in here.

41
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,720
- I mean, we are the only chicks in here.
- Yeah.

42
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,670
This makes me feel like
we're missing a sale.

43
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:12,530
Hey. There is nothing to worry about.

44
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,060
We are single ladies in 2008,

45
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,970
and we don't need a thing.

46
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,170
I need some tequila. I'm shaking.

47
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,790
Oh, roxanne's coming over here.Be nice.

48
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,970
What? I like roxanne.We just
don't have that much in common.

49
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:31,000
It's like,she doesn't really
drink.She's always all over lance.

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,720
I just don't know how to deal with girls who
are defined by their relationship, you know?

51
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,740
Shoot me if I'm ever like that, okay?

52
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,740
- Hey, you guys.
- Hi.

53
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,740
Thank you so much for coming.

54
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,580
Hi, roxanne. Happy birthday, lance.

55
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,580
Oh, thanks, but isn't every day
we don't die a happy new birth day?

56
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,650
Man, it's been forever
since I've seen you guys.

57
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,200
But I'll have more free time now,

58
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,380
since hillary lost the nomination
and our phone bank closed.

59
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,030
I can't believe our next president
could be the only black guy

60
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,370
in chicago lily hasn't slept with.

61
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,510
Still got five months.

62
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,680
Oh, no.

63
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,590
Well, we found where
chicago keeps all its dudes.

64
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,700
Yeah, really.The prettiest
girl in here is that asian guy.

65
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,040
All right, well,let's go get a
drink,and then we'll head out.

66
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,680
Just text that girl karen.She
has some cute friends.

67
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,730
No, I don't want to text
karen.She's so boring.

68
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:35,340
She doesn't have any opinions,and
she never has anything to say.

69
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,590
Yeah, definitely don't
text the perfect woman.

70
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,780
- Seriously?You're not gonna let me in?
- Not without i.d.

71
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,390
Uh, I left it at my office,where I work,

72
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,650
'cause I'm 30 years old.

73
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,920
But why do you still
dress like a nine-year-old?

74
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,120
- Wake up!Okay
- Okay.All right.

75
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,930
- I'm up.
- I'm up.

76
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,930
- Think I'll have that cigarette.
- Okay.

77
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,510
Be so much easier if you
could just snort cigarettes.

78
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:21,280
Hey, check it out. There's a girl.

79
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,850
I think we've struck bronze.

80
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,680
Yeah, well,there's one of her,and there's
two of us,so how should we play this?

81
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:36,350
I don't know.She should
probably be in the middle.

82
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,790
Okay, well, first of all,

83
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,060
"probably"?

84
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,080
Hi. Guess I'm gonna go find that asian guy. i'm talking
about we should rock, paper, scissors for her. Second of all,

85
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,280
Okay, here we go.

86
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,760
- Listen, I never do this,but-
- oh, god, please stop.

87
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,630
Every time a guy says, "i never
do this,"he always does this.

88
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,780
- Really?
- Yes.

89
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,720
Because what I was gonna
say is,I never do this,

90
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,320
but I could tell all the way from the other
end of the bar that your personality sucks.

91
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,010
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Oh, okay.

92
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,730
- Someone read the game.
- oh, yeah, no,I read the game,

93
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,840
but you're only supposed
to use those moves

94
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,050
for girls that you're
actually attracted to.

95
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,720
Yeah.

96
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,200
No, you're supposed to
have a comeback for that.

97
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,590
Okay, why don't you come back
as someone I'd be interested in?

98
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,650
That answers my question on what you're
doing alone in a bar full of guys.

99
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,750
You know what? I'm just gonna-

100
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,000
Hey, are you bipolar?

101
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,010
Are you bisexual?

102
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,170
Well, I am attracted to you.

103
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,520
Okay, I'm leaving.

104
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,560
Are you coming?

105
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,670
Ooh, she's playing hard to get.

106
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:18,950
You know, we're not even choosing
to talk to each other right now.

107
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,480
Our bodies chose for us.

108
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:25,670
It's millions of years of evolution.Are
you familiar with pheromones?

109
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,050
White guys, man.

110
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,960
'scuse me.

111
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,010
Sorry.

112
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,010
Weirdo.

113
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,200
Okay, uh...

114
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:48,380
This is a copy of my birth certificate.

115
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,640
Can I please go in now?

116
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:54,830
No.Now you just want it too much.

117
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,420
That guy.

118
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,850
Morning, whitney.

119
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,570
Morning...

120
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,800
you.

121
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,970
You know what? I really
have to get to work.

122
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,670
The boss is kind of a stickler, so-

123
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:30,080
you're a freelance
photographer, whitney.

124
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,900
You showed me a billboard
you did last night.

125
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,610
It was right after you got into
an argument with a parking meter.

126
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,180
Look, um, I never do this, so-

127
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,860
First of all, when a girl says she
never does this,she always does this.

128
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,880
Second of all,I actually don't
have many one-night stands either.

129
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,420
Oh, no, no, no, one-night
stands are, like, my jam.

130
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,890
I normally, um,never sleep
over.So I'm just gonna-

131
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,390
Oh, well, great.go.

132
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,960
Okay.

133
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,760
What, now you have dignity?

134
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,680
Look, dude.Here's the thing.

135
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,310
- I just,
um- - Dude?

136
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,100
You don't even know my name,do you?

137
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,600
Okay, I'm sorry. I forgot.

138
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,590
I'm sure you said it, like,
ten times last night, but-

139
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:19,050
Yeah, you know, you
said it a few times, too.

140
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,230
Your name is slow down?

141
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:25,340
Okay, look, I'm sorry.It's just that,

142
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:29,510
I just got out of something,and I
really need to workn on myself right now.

143
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,050
Okay.

144
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,470
I'm serious.I just,

145
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:38,040
- I could really see
myself- - Falling for me?

146
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,920
And you don't want to
take things too seriously?

147
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,040
You know what? It's okay.
You don't have to do this.

148
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,570
You don't ever have to
justify casual sex to a dude.

149
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:45,760
Great! Okay.

150
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,320
Okay, great. Perfect.

151
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,330
We don't have to pretend
this is more than it is.

152
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,450
- sometimes sex is just sex.
- Totally.

153
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:55,060
So what do I owe you?

154
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,870
I'm so glad we're hanging out.

155
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:09,130
We never get to have one-on-one
girl time.I mean, without whitney.

156
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:12,150
I usually only see you
when you're out... Partying.

157
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:15,480
So...what else do you like to do?

158
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,110
Uh, mushrooms.

159
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:22,110
Yeah, I love to do mushrooms and...

160
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,600
Oh. Oh, oh. Okay.

161
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,560
See, I was, um, I was thinking more
along the lines of rock climbing.

162
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,520
Oh, no, rock climbing on
mushrooms would be super-dangerous.

163
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,520
What do you like to do?

164
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,800
She likes making jewelry,meditating,and
dancing in my dreams.

165
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,120
Hey!

166
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,120
Didn't know lance was coming.

167
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,610
- For a girls' night.
- Just pretend I'm not here.

168
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,170
Yeah, you know what?Lance is
basically one of the girls anyway.

169
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,460
So tell me about this idea
you had for a food blog.

170
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,470
Oh, well, I have a very
sophisticated palate,

171
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:55,480
and I failed out of college, so...

172
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,360
Uh, can I get a shot?

173
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,420
And a shotgun.

174
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,410
Alex, do you remember
when you were like,

175
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:10,140
"i'll have a small
strawberry banana smoothie,"

176
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,620
and I was like,"do you want
a free boost with that...

177
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,950
Like my phone number?"

178
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,070
you remember that?

179
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,540
yeah.Well, it was two
days ago at jamba juice.

180
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:24,150
Are you mad at me?

181
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,560
No. Why would I be mad at you?

182
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:33,240
I'm just-I'm just being weird because
you didn't notice my new haircut.

183
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:37,500
Well, that's because we only met
once,and you were wearing a visor.

184
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:42,700
Excuse me.These drinks are
compliments of the lady over there.

185
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,320
Okay.

186
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,210
A beer for you.

187
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,870
And a shirley temple for the lady.

188
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:55,460
She wasn't sure that your
friend was of legal drinking age.

189
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,080
Unbelievable.

190
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,680
Who is he?Is he in a band?

191
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,760
Are they better than my band?

192
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,250
Does he have any weed?

193
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,930
Honestly, I don't even know his name.

194
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:12,880
This basket of bread is compliments
of the gentleman over there.

195
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:21,250
He said he was worried you may have
traded all your food for heroine.

196
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,800
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

197
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,300
Hey, hey, hey.

198
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,620
that was really cute what you
did back there with the drinks.

199
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,370
Thanks for the fight.

200
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:38,870
I'm sorry.I didn't mean to cause a
rift between you and your daughter.

201
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:41,090
Do you have her for the whole weekend?

202
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:44,510
- I met her two days
ago. - At build-a-bear?

203
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,890
- Come on, she's 26.
- Okay, I'm 26.

204
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,900
She looks ten years younger than me.

205
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:53,150
You know, I'm not quite
sure who you're insulting.

206
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:56,010
So I'm more clear:you need to
get some product for that hair,

207
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,650
because you look like courtney cox.

208
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:03,300
No, no, no.Clean hair, fresh
shave.That's like my thing.

209
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,110
Well, you should probably
get back to your date.

210
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,190
She probably needs you
to cut up her hot dog.

211
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:10,970
Well, you should probably get
back to your date.He's dead.

212
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,620
- Your date is terrible.
- Your date is the worst.

213
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,960
Hey, what the hell?

214
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,290
Oh, you know what?I
- I can't.

215
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:21,250
- Hey, my name is alex.
- Okay, great.

216
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:29,140
- hello?
- Hey.

217
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,400
I just got your message.You
had sex in the bathroom?

218
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,540
Yeah.

219
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,830
- When are you gonna see her again?
- I don't know.I haven't called her.

220
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,730
You don't call her, i'm gonna call her.

221
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,050
No-no, I don't have her number.

222
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,220
Oh, well, did you get a last name?

223
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,470
No.

224
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:46,670
I mean,she said it was cummings,but
that's obviously a joke.

225
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:50,900
You had sex in the men's bathroom?

226
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,740
Thank god your feet
never touched the ground.

227
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,810
Oh, my gosh.This is so exciting.

228
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:01,650
You know what?I'm gonna
have a second drink.

229
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,820
Oh, my god. He texted me.

230
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,380
How did he even get my number?

231
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,110
What's it say?

232
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:12,110
"I miss you."

233
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:15,060
This guy does not get me.

234
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,880
"my penis wrote that."

235
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,030
He totally gets you.

236
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,020
- Text him back.
- No, no.

237
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:28,400
Come-Admit it.You like this guy.

238
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,990
Okay, fine.I like him, okay?

239
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:35,430
He's really funny and super smart

240
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,670
and totally calls me out on my crap.

241
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:41,210
But I am not dumb enough to think that I
could have something real with him,okay?

242
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:43,280
I mean, what kind of person
leaves their date in a restaurant

243
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,530
to go have sex with
someone in a bathroom?

244
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,960
- You.
- Okay.

245
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,790
Yeah,and I'm a terrible person.Okay?

246
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:56,220
I mean,he's a random hookup,and
he's obviously a player.

247
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,810
But he tracked you down.

248
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:02,090
I mean, this guy could
be your soul mate.

249
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:05,450
Come on.Don't you believe
in fate?Or destiny?

250
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:08,210
Hey, I do not believe
in fate or destiny, okay?

251
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,310
Fate and destiny are names of strippers

252
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:13,620
who wind up being identified
by their dental records.

253
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,480
Okay, our waitress clearly
quit.I'm gonna go get us drinks.

254
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,220
Classic whitney.

255
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,490
Every time she likes a
guy,she pushes him away.

256
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:25,210
- I knew she wouldn't text him back.
- Oh, she's texting him back.

257
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:28,930
Okay, but if you want to sound like
her,it has to be something sexual.

258
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:30,730
Okay, uh...

259
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:34,160
I feel like I'm cheating on lance.

260
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,720
For god's sakes, give it to me.

261
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,330
"da da da-da da, from behind." send.

262
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,000
Okay, you guys, seriously,
let's go.This place is dead.

263
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,300
No! Dead? Are-are you kidding?

264
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,860
I mean, did you even notice?

265
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,580
Look, there's word
jumbles on the napkins.

266
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:55,350
Yeah, plus,i'm so
drunk I can't even move.

267
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,540
I just need to sit-

268
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,030
Okay, we can go.

269
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,410
- Hey.
- Hi.

270
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,180
What are you doing here?

271
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,130
Well, I-I got your text.

272
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,420
- My text?
- Yeah.

273
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,050
Okay, I'm gonna kill them.

274
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:16,670
I did not text you.They texted you.

275
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,670
So,

276
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,830
Well, uh...

277
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:23,750
I'm here now. Do you wanna go hang out?

278
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,550
Okay, you think you can just say the
word,and I'm gonna have sex with you again?

279
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:29,550
Well, no.

280
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:32,820
I mean, yeah, that
would probably work, but-

281
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:37,690
And your friends made some
pretty big promises on that text,

282
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,830
but-I- I'm saying that we could go
somewhere else and-and just hang out.

283
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:45,950
Okay, alex.You seem like
a very nice guy, alex.

284
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,880
Alex. I
- Look, I know you know my name.

285
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:52,010
But you-You're being an idiot.There's
obviously something here.

286
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,520
- Like what?
- Most girls I date are boring.

287
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,560
And, you know, you surprise me.

288
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,350
Mostly it's the bad kind of
surprise, yeah, sure.Of course.

289
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,730
But it's still a surprise.

290
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:05,320
And you know what?I
don't know how this ends.

291
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,970
I'm sorry, but I just don't
want a relationship.Okay?

292
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:14,160
I am on my own.And I
like it that way.So,

293
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,200
All right, tough guy.

294
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,450
You think you're tough
'cause you got sneakers.

295
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,390
What are you doing?
Are you-are you choking?

296
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,450
Everybody give us some room.Give
us some room. Here, here we go.

297
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,500
- Okay, I'm okay.
- One, two, three.

298
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,110
- I'm fine.
- Come on, shut up.Breathe!

299
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:31,430
It's-i'm fine!

300
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:32,960
It was an ice cube.It melted.

301
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,400
- I'm fine.
- Okay.

302
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,220
Thank you.

303
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,220
Yeah, you're welcome.

304
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,490
You just tried to save me. That's...

305
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:46,680
No guy I've ever dated
would've done that.

306
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,080
What kind of guys have you been dating?

307
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,100
I told lance he was not allowed to come.

308
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,010
Just us girls.

309
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:03,060
Am I drunk? 'cause if I am, I like it.

310
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,900
You've had two drinks.It
gets way better.

311
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,900
Oh, we should order jaeger bombs.

312
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,330
You know, 'cause we still
haven't seen each other naked.

313
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,480
Wha-oh, okay.

314
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,560
hang on. That's lance.

315
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,560
You know what?I'll just
let it go to voicemail.

316
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,260
Hey, I'm sorry,

317
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,770
you know, that I get annoyed
you're always with lance.

318
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,210
I
- I think maybe i'm just jealous.

319
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,800
You guys seem like the perfect couple,

320
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,720
and sometimes I just wish
I could meet the right guy.

321
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,500
{\a6}OPEN

322
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,880
lance and I are not the
perfect couple.We fight a lot.

323
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,490
I know it seems like
we don't, but... We do.

324
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:42,770
Yeah, but that
- That's okay.

325
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,330
I mean, everyone fights.
Just makes you normal.

326
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,190
Yeah, no, yeah. You're right.

327
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,850
we're probably just going
through a tough time.

328
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,040
You see, this is good.

329
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,440
This is why we have girl
time.So we can open up.

330
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,440
Yeah, we thought that
having a baby might solve it,

331
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,330
but we just have not been
able to get pregnant, you know.

332
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,850
The doctor thinks I might
have a tipped uterus, so.

333
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:01,640
Wow, okay. Throwing it wide open.

334
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,420
You know, I'm kind of
disappointed in you.

335
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,310
It's predictable and not surprising at all
to sleep with a guy that saved your life.

336
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:14,270
Okay, you did not save my
life,and I'm not gonna sleep.

337
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:18,160
- hold on.You're not gonna spend the night?
- No. That's not my thing.

338
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,310
It's not your thing.Got it.

339
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,310
Look, uh, hey.

340
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,310
I think you should go.

341
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,310
Excuse me?

342
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:30,010
Yeah, if you're not gonna spend the
night,then I think you should go.

343
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:34,070
Okay.You're not gonna sleep with me?

344
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,370

Nuh-uh.Bye-bye.

345
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,740
Okay, what game is this? 'cause
I will play,and I will win.

346
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:44,110
I just need to know the rules.

347
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,270
Look, it's not a game.I don't
want to play a game with you.

348
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,660
I like you, okay?

349
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,560
The whole thing where we hook up
and then you leave,I do that too.

350
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,150
But I don't want to do
that with you, all right?

351
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:57,580
Trust me, I can get a much less exhausting
version of that with other girls.

352
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:01,230
Okay, well, so I'm
just gonna sleep here?

353
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,260
No, you're gonna sleep here, all right?

354
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,060
'cause I sleep here.

355
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:09,940
And if you're still here in the
morning, then this is happening,okay?

356
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,940
So good night.

357
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,770
And hopefully, you're
here in the morning.

358
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,880
Okay, I know what this game is.

359
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,270
It's not a game. Shut up. Go to sleep.

360
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:00,200
Ha, ha. You're my girlfriend.

361
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,900
Three years later, and we're still here.

362
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,020
I guess you have to admit
mark's 48 hour rule is true.

363
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:16,360
Okay, I liked you,but it wasn't
until 3:00 in the morning,

364
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,470
so technically, that's 53 hours.

365
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:22,680
Oh, I guess we should just call
it, then.it's probably for the best.

366
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,510
It's been a long time
since you surprised me.

367
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,680
That was a surprise.

368
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,080
You know what would surprise me
would be if you cleaned it up.

369
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,360
Okay, fine. I'll give you a real one.

370
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,970
Something I've never told you before

371
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:42,780
is the morning after I saw you
at the restaurant,I looked you up.

372
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,290
I knew it.You were into me from day two.

373
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:48,590
You insulted me,you had sex with me
in a bathroom,and you told me to leave.

374
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:51,920
I mean, i'm only human.

375
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,960
