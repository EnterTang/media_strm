[The choice was made because of money?]

After considering many aspects,

Judge Jongshin came to his decision
during the tape change,

so we'll proceed immediately to the results.

Well it's just like a business kiss~

and you suddenly asking me
for someone else's phone number?

962
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:40,533
It's because I needed it and I forgot what it was

963
00:51:40,703 --> 00:51:42,777
Oppa, the fire went out. Light it back up!!

Do you really think the fire's going to light
back up with you fanning from up there.

974
00:52:10,534 --> 00:52:11,888
You should be doing it down here

Hyori! I have to quickly light this
so we can make dinner!

993

- Oh yea, you're right

Excuse me! I said over there!

Why is it when you're with Hyori...

1014

You take the route furthest away from her?

1015

Are you saying that in the show I'm a bad person?

1016

I want to say you're like constipation

Constipation?

1020

1034
00:55:31,796 --> 00:55:33,990

00:59:39,897 --> 00:59:41,339
You're embarrassed, aren't you?

1123
00:59:42,016 --> 00:59:44,202
Not everyone can pull this off~

1124
00:59:53,811 --> 00:59:56,961
You guys, we have peppers and sesame leaves,
what else do we need?

1125
00:59:57,018 --> 00:59:57,770
Meat

1126
00:59:57,771 --> 00:59:59,112
You're still talking about meat?

1127
00:59:59,283 --> 01:00:00,738
Do you have any money?

1128
01:00:01,286 --> 01:00:04,435
I'll buy as much meat as I can
with the money I have on me

1129
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:07,123
Hyung, will you be able to find a store?

1130
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:10,274
I think I'm going to have to suffer a bit...

1131
01:00:10,748 --> 01:00:13,923
Just hurry and go
and if they don't have any come back home

1132
01:00:13,958 --> 01:00:16,167
Alright! I can't stand this

1133
01:00:16,202 --> 01:00:19,200
You can't stand this?
Are you going to fight someone?

1134
01:00:20,619 --> 01:00:22,768
Will he be able to find it in the dark?

1135
01:00:23,348 --> 01:00:26,699
Whatever happens his will to live
will guide him back home.

1136
01:00:36,488 --> 01:00:37,630
Wow~

1137
01:00:38,666 --> 01:00:40,924
This is seriously a prairie...

1138
01:00:45,084 --> 01:00:47,233
Oh! dog.
There's only the sound of dogs barking

1139
01:00:50,077 --> 01:00:51,820
But I have to eat meat!

1140
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:58,423
Are there no stores?

1141
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:02,306
Is there a store here~?!

1142
01:01:03,914 --> 01:01:06,193

I have to keep going

1145
01:01:19,159 --> 01:01:20,560
How many km have I walked?

1146
01:01:23,453 --> 01:01:24,877
Oh! It's a store!

1147
01:01:32,887 --> 01:01:34,251
Grandmother, hello!

1148

Welcome. How can I help you?

1149
01:01:38,432 --> 01:01:40,905
We're trying to make stew and...

1150
01:01:40,906 --> 01:01:42,455
We don't have anything you can make stew with

1151
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:44,864
You don't have canned meat?

1152
01:01:44,893 --> 01:01:46,037
We don't

1153
01:01:47,353 --> 01:01:49,546
Oh! It's right here

1154
01:01:50,466 --> 01:01:54,377
It's past the expiration date.
You can't eat it.

1155
01:01:55,067 --> 01:01:57,186
Jongshin: This one too?
Grandmother: yeah

1156
01:02:02,777 --> 01:02:06,478
Grandma, it says it expired in 2005!

1157
01:02:06,833 --> 01:02:11,138
We had it up there to sell but no one bought it
so it's just sitting there~

1158
01:02:12,689 --> 01:02:14,249
So it's like interior decorations

1159
01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:21,014
Oh that means I can't buy it

1160
01:02:21,050 --> 01:02:23,292
But we need to make stew

1161
01:02:23,897 --> 01:02:26,572
We don't really have anything for that

1162
01:02:27,423 --> 01:02:28,800
Then how much are the sausages?

1163
01:02:28,810 --> 01:02:29,863
60 cents

1164
01:02:29,864 --> 01:02:31,011
60 cents?

1165
01:02:31,012 --> 01:02:32,169
Oooh

1166
01:02:33,679 --> 01:02:34,765
You're going to use that?

1167
01:02:34,766 --> 01:02:35,759
Yes

1168
01:02:36,896 --> 01:02:39,240
If I squeeze this wouldn't the oils come out?

1169
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:43,367
Why don't you try cooking it with this?

1170
01:02:43,368 --> 01:02:45,452
What is it? Dried fish?
How much is the dried fish?

1171
01:02:46,676 --> 01:02:47,785
8 dollars

1172
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:53,046
Thank you! Goodbye!

1173
01:02:54,171 --> 01:02:55,674
How are you going to boil that?

1174
01:02:56,167 --> 01:02:57,943

Hyung try the tofu we just made

1188
01:03:48,493 --> 01:03:50,097
Hyung, it's a work of art

1189

Chunhee: Stand in line.
Changeui, you have to stand in line!

How is it? It's a work of art isn't it?

It's seriously a work of art!

- Yea

1280
01:09:16,305 --> 01:09:19,228
He also farts a lot

1281
01:09:19,827 --> 01:09:21,727
(That's the most sexiest!)

1282
01:09:23,895 --> 01:09:26,135
(Yeah he seems so manly...)

1283
01:09:26,616 --> 01:09:28,492
(He seems so manly...)

1284
01:09:30,024 --> 01:09:31,533
Success!

1285
01:09:40,028 --> 01:09:43,747
I'm actually filming right now

1286
01:09:44,386 --> 01:09:46,009
(Hahaha...)

1287
01:09:47,502 --> 01:09:50,109
- (Oh so that's why you kept talking about Jongshin oppa)
- Yeah

1288
01:09:50,144 --> 01:09:55,156
Seriously when would Jongshin oppa ever
take off his jacket? And carry wood, whatever.

1289
01:09:55,157 --> 01:09:59,413
I had to hear from you that Jongshin is manly

1290
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:06,730
Oh what do I do, it's going to broadcast that I said he has a weak body

1291
01:10:06,820 --> 01:10:10,340
What's there to do?  It's the truth and you were only speaking honestly

1292
01:10:11,150 --> 01:10:11,930
Hold on a moment

1293
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,810
Sooro hyung, why are you grabbing the phone?

1294
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:20,060
Yuhjung! It's Sooro oppa!

1295
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:21,520
Oppa!

1296
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,630
Yuhjung-ah!!

1297
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:24,980
I miss you!

1298
01:10:25,230 --> 01:10:26,990
I miss you too, so much!

1299
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:28,170
You're doing well, right?

1300
01:10:28,210 --> 01:10:29,880
I'm having a lot of fun watching the program

1301
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:32,400
I'm doing a play in 2 months!

1302
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:37,120
When I do the play you better come and watch

1303
01:10:43,110 --> 01:10:44,890
I'll call you another time!

1304
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:47,970
Yes, bye!

1305
01:10:49,530 --> 01:10:51,650
She's really cute!

1306
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:54,080
Should I try it now?

1307
01:10:58,050 --> 01:10:59,460
Yoo Jaesuk is so handsome

1308
01:10:59,650 --> 01:11:01,230
That doesn't make any sense

1309
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:06,260
Who are you going to call?

1310
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:07,490
(Park) Myungsoo

1311
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:09,030
Good good! I like him

1312
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:12,300
What?

1313
01:11:12,450 --> 01:11:13,920
Hyung, it's me

1314
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:16,070
Sorry, I just drank a bottle of alcohol

1315
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:24,090
Hyung! I'm calling from Family Outing right now!  Where are you?

1316
01:11:24,450 --> 01:11:25,680
You don't need to know!

1317
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:28,470
I know I don't need to know

1318
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:29,940
I'm out having dinner with friends

1319
01:11:30,050 --> 01:11:31,810
Oh you are?

1320
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:32,630
Yeah

1321
01:11:33,970 --> 01:11:37,600
Hyung, how do you think I look?

1322
01:11:38,290 --> 01:11:39,480
Depressed

1323
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,780
I'll just call you another time

1324
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:52,250
Don't call me. Hang up!

1325
01:12:01,730 --> 01:12:04,020
Ok now it's Chunhee's turn

1326
01:12:05,690 --> 01:12:07,640
Chunhee would make the best husband

1327
01:12:08,030 --> 01:12:09,340
That seems alright

1328
01:12:10,230 --> 01:12:11,930
I think he'd be able to get someone to say that

1329
01:12:12,290 --> 01:12:14,030
I'm going to call Park GunHyung

1330
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:25,520
Chunsoo~

1331
01:12:28,570 --> 01:12:29,060
What are you up to?

1332
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:31,520
At a shoot

1333
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:34,360
Where are you?

1334
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:35,940
Naju

1335
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,100
Is it cold?

1336
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:42,840
It's sooooo cold!

1337
01:12:42,910 --> 01:12:46,120
Oh sorry I should have left you a jacket or something

1338
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:49,200
It's seriously cold

1339
01:12:49,910 --> 01:12:55,990
Lately since filming Family Outing I have a lot of people coming up telling me good things

1340
01:12:56,150 --> 01:12:57,690
How do you think women look at me?

1341
01:12:58,200 --> 01:12:59,900
One that suffers.  To me at least.

1342
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:13,460
No to women.  You look at me and see someone who suffers, but women

1343
01:13:13,510 --> 01:13:16,320
They see me being nice and looking out for Hyori and Yejin

1344
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:19,370
Women should see something in that, don't you think?

1345
01:13:21,290 --> 01:13:22,600
Why are you being like this?

1346
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:24,880
How do you think I'll be once I'm married?

1347
01:13:25,670 --> 01:13:28,580
Huh? I don't know because I will not marry you

1348
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:35,600
No like what kind of qualities would I have as a husband?

1349
01:13:36,430 --> 01:13:38,330
You're being weird, what's wrong with you?

1350
01:13:41,490 --> 01:13:42,770
Park Gunhyung!

1351
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:45,780
I'm filming right now

1352
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:47,470
What kind of shoot?

1353
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:49,410
Family Outing

1354
01:13:51,580 --> 01:13:55,140
All you had to do was say I'd be a good husband!

1355
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:57,800
Jaesuk hyung wants to talk to you

1356
01:13:59,570 --> 01:14:05,080
Gunhyung, we have Changeui on our set as well

1357
01:14:05,890 --> 01:14:07,090
Changeui's there?

1358
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:09,450
What's he doing over there?

1359
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:13,090
We're filming our show right now

1360
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:18,230
Hold on there's someone that wants to speak to you

1361
01:14:20,770 --> 01:14:25,030
Hey Gunhyung!  Why don't you ever call me?!

1362
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,010
Let me see your face

1363
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:34,170
-In 2 months I'm going to be doing a play
-Stop it!

1364
01:14:35,550 --> 01:14:36,790
Come see my play!

1365
01:14:36,890 --> 01:14:38,010
We'll go to each other's plays

1366
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:46,270
Ok thank you Gunhyung!

1367
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:52,070
Oh this one is hard

1368
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:55,020
Sooro is the sexiest guy

1369
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,790
It can't just be Sooro is sexy, it has to be Sooro is the sexiest guy?

1370
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:00,380
Yeah

1371
01:15:02,570 --> 01:15:03,790
(Kim) HyunJoon

1372
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:12,940
Hello?

1373
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:13,780
Hello?

1374
01:15:16,670 --> 01:15:18,640
Is this Hyunjoon's phone?

1375
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:22,950
No it is not

1376
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:24,800
I'm sorry, sir!

1377
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:36,490
I was wondering why his voice sounded so strange

1378
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:40,540
It's because I haven't called him in so long

1379
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:43,720
Now it's Kim Sooro's turn

1380
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:49,720
[Hyori is very feminine]

1381
01:15:53,660 --> 01:15:56,130
Why did you give me the hardest one?

1382
01:15:56,210 --> 01:15:58,100
Oh you're calling that person?

1383
01:15:58,570 --> 01:15:59,610
It's a work of art

1384
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:01,390
I really like this person!!

1385
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:09,270
Hello?

1386
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:16,600
(Ha) Jongwoo! How have you been?  It's been awhile hasn't it?

1387
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:17,940
Yes it has

1388
01:16:19,070 --> 01:16:23,460
You mentioned you like watching Family Outing?

1389
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:25,110
It's a lot of fun

1390
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:30,220
What do you think of Hyori?

1391
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:34,830
She's very beautiful

1392
01:16:36,970 --> 01:16:43,420
We were just saying how Hyori is like a guy to us and like a little brother

1393
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:46,030
But you know, you could think differently

1394
01:16:46,130 --> 01:16:47,960
To someone like you, how do you see her?

1395
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:49,950
Because she's like a guy to us

1396
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:54,440
Out of all the female singers, isn't she the best?

1397
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:02,500
But she's a guy to us.  What do you think?

1398
01:17:04,930 --> 01:17:10,100
She may seem like a guy, but she also seems feminine as well.

1399
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:11,620
Success!

1400
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:19,030
I told you, everyone else thinks of me like that.
-Is that by any chance Ha Jongwoo?

1401
01:17:19,050 --> 01:17:21,710
-Yes, it is
-I really like him! The Chaser!

1402
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:27,860
Hey, Big Bang's Daesung says he's a really big fan

1403
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:29,230
Just talk to him for a bit

1404
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:30,540
Okay

1405
01:17:30,570 --> 01:17:31,720
Ah! What do I do?

1406
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:33,720
Hello?

1407
01:17:36,470 --> 01:17:37,650
Is this Ha Jongwoo?

1408
01:17:37,930 --> 01:17:38,950
Yes

1409
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:40,310
HELLO!

1410
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:42,310
It's nice to meet you

1411
01:17:42,530 --> 01:17:44,850
You're still doing The Chaser right?

1412
01:17:46,180 --> 01:17:50,820
I'm really anticipating it, and once it comes out I'll be the first in line

1413
01:17:52,270 --> 01:17:53,810
All he said was yes

1414
01:17:54,010 --> 01:17:57,570
Thanks Jongwoo, bye

1415
01:17:57,900 --> 01:17:59,410
He's got a lot of charisma

1416
01:17:59,910 --> 01:18:01,170
I got to talk to him and everything

1417
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:10,430
Yejin is very loveable

1418
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:18,790
Hi Jongshin

1419
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:19,810
Yes hyung

1420
01:18:20,010 --> 01:18:21,190
Yes yes yes yes

1421
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:22,280
(Kim Gookjin) Hyung, what are you doing?

1422
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:23,980
I'm just sitting here

1423
01:18:24,090 --> 01:18:26,380
How come you're always doing nothing?

1424
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:30,190
I'm only doing nothing half the time

1425
01:18:31,470 --> 01:18:38,500
Do you by any chance watch Family Outing?

1426
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:40,150
I do

1427
01:18:40,330 --> 01:18:44,190
You know Park Yejin on the show?

1428
01:18:44,930 --> 01:18:46,650
Yeah, yeah, Lady Yejin

1429
01:18:48,370 --> 01:18:49,960
What do you think of her?

1430
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:51,650
Huh?

1431
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:54,760
What if he thinks he's trying to set up a date?

1432
01:18:54,190 --> 01:18:55,790
She's got a good color to her

1433
01:18:55,890 --> 01:18:59,910
And she has charisma since she's an actress

1434
01:19:00,490 --> 01:19:02,910
And she's good at sucking it up

1435
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:11,860
She comes off as very innocent

1436
01:19:14,050 --> 01:19:15,550
Without any flaws

1437
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:19,510
As a woman, how is she?

1438
01:19:19,670 --> 01:19:21,190
good

1439
01:19:22,590 --> 01:19:26,780
You seem to have watched her a lot on the show

1440
01:19:26,980 --> 01:19:29,960
I did, because she just sucks it up

1441
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:35,080
Hyung this isn't a dating program

1442
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:41,130
I'll put Yejin on the phone

1443
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:45,680
Hello?

1444
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:48,970
Hello? Who is this now?

1445
01:19:51,190 --> 01:19:52,480
It's me!

1446
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:55,720
It's Jaesuk!

1447
01:19:57,660 --> 01:19:59,620
Wait, so you guys are filming right now?

1448
01:19:59,830 --> 01:20:00,770
Yeah

1449
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:02,180
Oooh

1450
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:10,350
You didn't know we were filming? Is what you said the truth?

1451
01:20:10,790 --> 01:20:12,100
I thought Jongshin was just calling me for no reason

1452
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:18,930
Hold on a second I'll put Yejin on the line

1453
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:22,720
Hello I'm suck it up Yejin

1454
01:20:23,660 --> 01:20:27,580
Oh I really like watching you on the show

1455
01:20:31,390 --> 01:20:35,640
Hyung, I had no idea you liked her so much

1456
01:20:36,110 --> 01:20:40,790
No it's just that.. it's just.. who doesn't like Yejin on Family Outing?

1457
01:20:43,830 --> 01:20:48,350
Thank you for liking me on the show, I had no idea you had so much feelings for me

1458
01:20:48,930 --> 01:20:52,170
No, it's just.. you.. I saw it on TV

1459
01:20:54,120 --> 01:21:02,010
Sorry for calling you out of the blue.  I'll give you a call another time, thank you!

1460
01:21:11,230 --> 01:21:14,470
Daesung, you seem smarter than Jaesuk

1461
01:21:15,890 --> 01:21:18,370
I'm going to call President Yang (head of YG Family, Yang Hyunsuk)

1462
01:21:19,930 --> 01:21:23,280
I don't really call him usually

1463
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:25,760
You should call him every now and then

1464
01:21:25,950 --> 01:21:27,850
Should I do this? I'm really nervous

1465
01:21:30,830 --> 01:21:32,220
Ah, it's our song!

1466
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:35,490
Hello? Who is this?

1467
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:40,360
Hello?  Hello!

1468
01:21:40,870 --> 01:21:42,960
What is it Daesung?

1469
01:21:43,650 --> 01:21:47,640
My IQ is 110

1470
01:21:48,250 --> 01:21:49,340
What?

1471
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:57,480
My IQ is 110.  And Jaesuk hyung is 114.

1472
01:21:57,790 --> 01:21:58,870
Uh huh

1473
01:21:59,070 --> 01:22:02,720
Have you ever wondered if he lied about his score?

1474
01:22:03,890 --> 01:22:05,420
Yoo Jaesuk?

1475
01:22:09,020 --> 01:22:11,220
I think you're score might be a lie, too

1476
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:16,430
No actually it should be higher.  Because I can't have a stupid image.

1477
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:22,510
Watching Family Outing, how do I seem to you?

1478
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:26,500
Because lately I've been trying to seem more smart

1479
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:32,240
Who am I smarter than?

1480
01:22:33,050 --> 01:22:34,720
Oh in comparison?

1481
01:22:35,110 --> 01:22:38,960
Uh.. Yoon Jongshin

1482
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:48,210
Hyunsuk-ah!  Why are you being like that?

1483
01:22:49,490 --> 01:22:51,310
Ok, failed!

1484
01:22:58,690 --> 01:23:00,590
I'm sorry, did we wake you?

1485
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:02,480
Oh I was just taking a nap

1486
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:05,630
Why are you sleeping at this hour?

1487
01:23:06,860 --> 01:23:14,920
Daesung told us once that you told him he can't ever have a stupid image

1488
01:23:15,330 --> 01:23:22,050
I did.  I think he became like that after hanging out with you

1489
01:23:37,130 --> 01:23:40,250
Changeui and Hyori seem good for one another

1490
01:23:40,980 --> 01:23:42,990
Did Changeui write this himself?

1491
01:23:45,130 --> 01:23:47,890
It seems like everyone that went to this school likes Hyori

1492
01:23:50,290 --> 01:23:54,550
And when he got kissed by Hyori earlier

1493
01:23:57,090 --> 01:23:59,350
He must really like her

1494
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:04,230
I'm going to call Oh Jiho

1495
01:24:15,010 --> 01:24:15,820
Hello?

1496
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:16,830
Hello

1497
01:24:17,410 --> 01:24:19,560
Oh who could this be?

1498
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:25,300
Hyung, do you know Family Outing?

1499
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:26,890
Yeah

1500
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:29,060
I have to go on that show

1501
01:24:29,290 --> 01:24:31,710
Do you know who Hyori is?

1502
01:24:32,050 --> 01:24:34,670
Of course I know who she is.  Is there anyone that doesn't?

1503
01:24:35,730 --> 01:24:38,710
Imagine me and her together, what do you think?

1504
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:40,410
You guys don't go well together

1505
01:24:43,030 --> 01:24:45,730
Think about it carefully!

1506
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:48,940
Even carefully considering it, it still doesn't seem right

1507
01:24:49,770 --> 01:24:51,280
Failed!

1508
01:24:55,020 --> 01:24:56,770
Oh Jiho, hello!

1509
01:24:56,830 --> 01:24:58,580
Oh hello!

1510
01:24:58,690 --> 01:24:59,870
Are you guys filming right now?

1511
01:24:59,870 --> 01:25:00,730
Yes

1512
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:03,430
Hello everyone, I am Oh Jiho

1513
01:25:05,970 --> 01:25:08,840
Since I told him we're doing the show he even introduces himself

1514
01:25:09,620 --> 01:25:12,350
I was just wondering why you thought they didn't fit together?

1515
01:25:12,770 --> 01:25:14,700
Because Hyori would be at a loss then

1516
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:21,520
But looking at these two it seems alright to me

1517
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:27,320
Well if Changeui wants it that's good for him

1518
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:35,660
and I guess if Hyori doesn't mind, then .. ahh.. it'd be alright

1519
01:25:40,090 --> 01:25:42,260
His voice changed

1520
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:58,290
out of the successes, we have Park Yejin in 4 minutes

1521
01:25:58,570 --> 01:26:04,590
and Kim Sooro at a minute and a half.  Kim Sooro, winner
