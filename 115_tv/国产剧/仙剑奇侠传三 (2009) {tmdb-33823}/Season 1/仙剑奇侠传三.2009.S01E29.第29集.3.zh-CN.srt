It also has been a while since I've seen the sunrise...

161
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,690
I think it has been covered

162
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,610
-By the clouds...
-I think it's covered by the clouds.

163
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:31,010
Hyuk, you were in the military here in Kang Won Do.

164
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,970
Has the sun risen yet?

165
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,190
This isn't sunrise.

166
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,140
It's not?

167
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,210
Hyuk says it's not sunrise yet.

168
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,820
It rose?

169
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,170
The energy doesn't come up like that, but comes from underneath and spreads up.

170
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,870
Then hasn't it been covered by the clouds?

171
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:56,660
It's supposed to come up from there, isn't it?

172
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,900
Wow!  The sun is up!

173
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,260
Wow!  The sun is up!

174
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,770
The sun that has been covered by the clouds...

175
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,460
Ah, this is ...

176
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,460
Because the sun has broken through the clouds...

177
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,340
It's dazzling.

178
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,760
The first sunrise of 2009!

179
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:52,390
The new year of 2009 has become bright!

180
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,100
[Having sent 2008, the year they first met under the name of Family]

181
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:02,150
[The similar small eyed brothers]

182
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,800
[And The serious man who is with them for the new year]

183
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,800
[And the elder who is always looking after his health and the national star who now needs to look after her health]

184
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,800
[With Jaesuk, who always throws his body for the Family]

185
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,700
[And Chunhee who throws his body without knowing it]

186
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,270
[And Soo Ro, who always gives the family much energy]

187
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:19,050
[And lady Ye Jin who gives everyone sweet dreams]

188
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,400
[All standing in a row in the same place]

189
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:30,050
[Like the rising sun, holding onto swelling hopes]

190
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,400
[They are meeting the new year, 2009, together]

191
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,190
The new year of 2009 is bright.

192
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,860
Everyone will state their resolutions

193
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:51,910
And expectations for the new year.

194
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:55,830
In 2009

195
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,610
My family

196
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,490
And our Family Outing members

197
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,700
I wish them all to be healthy

198
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:08,010
And that everything they do succeed.

199
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,690
Happy New Year!

200
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:19,040
And this year...

201
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,180
The work I used to do

202
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:28,000
And my movies and dramas, I wish will do well!

203
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,770
Chun Hee, fighting!

204
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:40,040
Because he's an actor...

205
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,090
I wish him the best and that he can be in a good movie or drama.

206
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,110
Soo Ro hyung.

207
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,300
My fellow citizens!

208
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,220
2009!

209
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,730
Are you campaigning?

210
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:01,590
They say that the world economy is on hard times!

211
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,780
You must be having a hard time as well!

212
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:10,000
On Sundays at 5:10

213
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,290
While watching Family Outing

214
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:16,330
I wish that your troubles would be washed away.

215
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:21,240
And, even though it's hard

216
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,700
In 2009

217
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:28,170
Let's show everyone that we can do it!

218
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:34,760
And I wish that Kim Soo Ro's movies would be hits!

219
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,290
Please love Kim Soo Ro's movies

220
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:44,550
And I humbly ask that the viewership ratings of Family Outing rise to over 30%!

221
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,080
I just wanted to say that we should keep going straight.

222
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,940
Hyori.

223
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,860
In 2009

224
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,510
After meeting a cool guy, I want to get married

225
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:07,160
And have the work I'm doing now do even better

226
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:11,650
And release another album that will receive a lot of love

227
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,710
And I will completely control Jong Kook oppa so that he feels timid!

228
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,510
Okay, next is...

229
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,170
Jong Kook.

230
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,120
Jong Kook's thoughts

231
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,020
Please speak in a thick voice please.

232
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,370
In 2009

233
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,120
He's conscious of it.

234
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:45,520
I wish that everyone I love and everyone who loves me all stay healthy.

235
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:54,240
I may have come into the Family late, but like a real family, I'd like to be more comfortable with them and

236
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:59,070
I would like to become someone who works harder.

237
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:04,110
And... I will never be controlled!

238
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,420
Please don't worry...

239
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,160
You've already been had oppa!

240
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,220
It's just that... because she's like a cute hubae

241
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,220
[Note:  hubae = someone in the industry after you]

242
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,840
I will look after her...

243
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,440
I will look after Lee Hyori...ssi...

244
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,920
What will you be looking after?

245
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,890
Don't worry.

246
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:26,430
I will look after her well.  And I wish my albums do well

247
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:30,120
I wish the economy would revive and that everyone becomes wealthy.

248
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,460
I wish you become wealthy!

249
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,600
Don't become timid yourself.

250
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,780
I'm okay!

251
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:41,000
And next is Ye Jin.

252
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,760
In 2009

253
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,320
I wish that my body and heart stay healthy

254
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,050
And that there are results that match my efforts

255
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:58,000
And that Jong Shin hyung will be in less pain

256
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:03,270
And I wish that there will be many cool guests who come this year!

257
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:16,430
It is 2009!

258
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,080
That's the same tone as 'It's Daesung'!

259
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:23,720
It's 2009!

260
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,540
Everyone, health is the most important!

261
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,130
I wish that everyone's work goes well

262
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,780
And that we don't forget to laugh.

263
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,210
And that I also don't forget to laugh

264
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,920
And stay healthy

265
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,460
With good music

266
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:47,920
I wish that I will become someone who is loved by more people!

267
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,070
And this year...

268
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,770
I will not cross the line!

269
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,810
You're not going to cross the line anymore?

270
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,040
-You're saying that to idols, right?
-He's saying that he's become a man?

271
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,800
Yes, do that.

272
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,610
Yes

273
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,760
He's now an adult.
Now, Hyuk.

274
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,240
In 2009

275
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,330
I wish we become a better country

276
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:14,290
And personally

277
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:17,020
A good family...

278
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,990
I wish I can have a good family!

279
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:24,080
Please stay healthy!

280
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,050
Um...

281
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:32,430
It's supposed to be, personally I wish to be a good head of the family for my family.

282
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,130
But because he said 'a good family'... he forgot.

283
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,720
In 2009

284
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:43,360
I wish that my whole family including La-ik stay healthy.

285
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,140
The Family has to be healthy as well.

286
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,500
And my remaining...

287
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:50,990
I have a few loans remaining...

288
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,720
I wish that I'd pay them all back.

289
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:56,130
In 2009

290
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,910
I wish they'd develop a new medicine

291
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,120
That will let people over forty

292
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:04,130
Continue to grow!

293
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,280
(Me too...)

294
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:11,610
Now that we've all finished

295
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:19,000
In 2009, everyone have a happy new year!

296
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:25,700
We will work hard to bring more laughter to more people.

297
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,370
I wish this year will be a year full of laughs

298
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:35,020
Everyone!  Many blessings to you in the new year!

299
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:46,210
Ah, I feel good inside.

300
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,700
Let's go now.

301
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:49,740
No!

302
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,360
Why?

303
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,630
We have to do what we got to do before we go.

304
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,290
If we go now

305
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,020
The people who have to make breakfast will make breakfast...

306
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,810
Everyone else can rest while breakfast is being made.

307
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:00,850
Do it here?

308
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:01,710
Let's do it here!

309
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:05,260
We will do our 'wake up mission' here.

310
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,170
Okay, first...

311
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,070
We'll start with Jang Hyuk-ssi and Jong Kook-ssi.

312
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:16,420
First spin five times doing 'elephant nose' and go quickly

313
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:20,940
To bring back water in your hands, but whoever is faster wins.

314
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,720
But, you can't have no water in your hands.

315
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,280
Understood?

316
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,470
Okay, sta...

317
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,730
It's the first competition between friends in the new year.

318
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:33,560
Okay, sta...

319
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,650
[Here] [There]

320
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:37,890
He can't do the 'elephant nose'...

321
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,810
He can't do it because of his muscles.

322
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,910
Just try... Now sta...

323
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,980
Start!

324
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,690
One

325
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:47,780
Two

326
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:48,900
Three

327
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,860
Four

328
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,160
Three

329
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,250
Four

330
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,780
Five.  Go!

331
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,830
Five.  Go!

332
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:00,030
Okay...

333
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,410
Be careful of your feet...

334
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:04,940
Your gloves!

335
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,960
Your glove in the water!

336
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,000
Glove!

337
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,050
Hyuk, your glove!

338
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,320
Hyuk, your glove!

339
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:15,040
Hyuk, your glove!

340
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,350
Because he wants to be Jong Kook...

341
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:21,790
Jong Kook...

342
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:23,400
There's water.

343
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,320
Success!  Win!

344
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,460
Water, water, water!

345
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:35,650
Kim Soo Ro, win!

346
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,760
Hyori and Ye Jin

347
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:42,500
If we're talking competitive, then in Family Outing...

348
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:45,510
There's no one who can follow these two.

349
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:47,720
I want to win and go to sleep.

350
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,040
Ready!

351
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,260
[Careless Chun Hee, not fully awake yet]

352
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,610
Okay, st...

353
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,490
Start!

354
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:56,700
One.  Wait, Hyori-ssi.

355
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,760
How can you start in the beginning of the new year?

356
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,440
Why?

357
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,360
You have to bend down.

358
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:06,850
Ready!

359
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,880
Because we played so hard last night...

360
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,990
Start!

361
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,650
One

362
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,050
Wait, Hyori-ssi...

363
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,000
You have to do it correctly.

364
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:18,690
Let's start again.

365
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:21,590
Are you okay, Ye Jin-ssi?

366
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:25,880
I did bend, but you couldn't tell because of the clothes.

367
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,900
No, you can't do that...

368
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:31,300
Okay, start!

369
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,440
One, two

370
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,710
Three, four

371
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,400
Five!

372
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:51,060
There has to be water remaining and you have to come quickly!

373
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:57,500
There has to be water remaining!

374
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,660
Ye Jin, where are you going?!

375
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:14,060
Hyori came first.

376
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,630
There is, there is!

377
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:17,740
There is.

378
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,640
Hyori, win!

379
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,690
Oh, the amount doesn't matter?

380
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,020
-The amount does not matter
-What did I hear before...?

381
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:30,570
Well, it's now me, Jong Shin-ssi and Daesung.

382
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,850
Hyori-ssi, please be our referee.

383
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:36,480
Ready, start!

384
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:44,140
How many turns has it been...

385
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,410
How many turns has it been...?

386
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,940
Run!

387
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,510
[Because no one wants to make breakfast, running like it's life and death]

388
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,120
Run!

389
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,670
Be careful!

390
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,960
Why isn't Daesung coming?

391
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:13,030
Oh there's water!

392
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,580
-Ah, it's all destroyed.
-Jaesuk oppa, win.  Ah, Daesung lost.

393
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,380
[Lost the game, and...]

394
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:21,960
I wanted to take care of the boots Chun Hee hyung bought us...

395
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,350
Ah because you wanted to save the boots.

396
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,240
(You can wash it...)

397
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:28,320
Now, the last game to find who will be in charge of breakfast.

398
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,150
The defeated!

399
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:31,650
We will go into a repechage.

400
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:39,020
Lee Chunhee, Daesung, Ye Jin and Hyuk, all four of you together.

401
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,470
Ready!

402
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,030
It's the last.

403
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:46,080
The males will make 10 turns, and Park Ye Jin will be 7 turns.

404
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,870
You're all ready, right?

405
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:50,620
Sta...art!

406
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,480
One, two

407
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:58,620
Three, four, five

408
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,770
Six, seven!

409
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,520
Ten!

410
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:14,940
[Tumultuous confusion]

411
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,600
Ye Jin!  Be careful!

412
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,930
Oy, Daesung...

413
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,740
[But Daesung again, trip~]

414
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,300
[Daesung, 2009, first breakfast duty decided?]

415
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,760
Daesung, come quickly!

416
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,220
Hyuk, there's no water...

417
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:43,030
There's water here.

418
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,250
Water.  Pass.  Pass!

419
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:48,070
Hyuk had no water...

420
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:51,100
Hyuk, there was no water!

421
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,650
Pass!

422
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,100
Hyuk had no water...

423
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:07,300
It's sad, but Jang Hyuk-ssi has

424
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,470
Lost the game.  He did come in early, but...

425
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:13,010
He had no water left.

426
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:18,020
Please pick two people to make breakfast with you.

427
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:20,100
[As always... averting their gaze]

428
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:22,670
Please say something nice to me...

429
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:25,080
Since it's the new year...

430
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:29,390
The sun might be out like that,

431
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,860
But I only see Hyuk in my eyes.

432
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,800
Jang Hyuk-ssi's look and expression

433
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:37,990
Is very clear.

434
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,260
It's very genuine.

435
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:42,010
Did you see his eyes when he said, 'I've brought the hwanggi' yesterday?

436
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,330
In one area of my heart, always...

437
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:47,750
There is a bright someone who I always think of.

438
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:51,920
I would like to call him Hyuk without hesitation.

439
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,110
I think you'll be picked immediately.

440
00:29:55,820 --> 00:30:01,760
Hyuk oppa, choose someone you think will be comfortable and easy to make breakfast with.

441
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,050
I'll pick the knowledgeable ones, Jaesuk and Sooro.

442
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,530
I have to make breakfast again.

443
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,590
Let's go.

444
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:25,250
[Here begins the first meal of 2009 cooked earnestly by three guys]

445
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:45,260
I'm sorry that I don't have much to say to you, brothers.

446
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:52,610
I didn't know that my one phrase will turn out like this.

447
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,150
It's already in the past, don't be so burdened Hyuk ah!

448
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:02,690
Having to cook breakfast again in the new year makes me very happy.

449
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:10,460
Actually, going back to sleep in the morning doesn't seem quite right.

450
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,730
Don't feel burdened, Hyuk ah!

451
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:17,970
Ever since you came, if you were to cook, I will *huuk* feel like doing it too.

452
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:25,070
Everyone only slept for two hours, so tiring. What's more, there's an elderly.

453
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:31,980
By elderly, you mean...? He will hear you. That hyung's ears are very sensitive.

454
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:38,250
Let's do a good one.

455
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:41,700
Coming to this village, only two things come to mind.

456
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,820
What are they?

457
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:46,240
Co-op center, and bean curd.

458
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,400
Where are we going to get those?

459
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,360
In the village, there are grandmas who are famous for their bean curd.

460
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,310
Really? Oh~

461
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:59,420
-Then we should go and have a look.
-Let's go.

462
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:04,850
Let's go to the co-op center and get bean curd.

463
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:19,690
Coming out so early in the morning, the feeling is great.

464
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:22,150
Hyuk, are you in a good mood?

465
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,430
Of course.

466
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:37,180
Hyung, you're doing the dance with much feeling.

467
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,890
Hyuk, what are you doing?

468
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,960
Hyuk is still a little reserved.

469
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,070
Just do whatever you feel like doing!

470
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:16,650
It's here...

471
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,650
It's grandma's house.

472
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:28,030
-Hello.
-Hello.
-Hello.

473
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:34,040
I'm sorry, you were doing a facial... The chief told us to come here..

474
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,600
Bring over the pot straight away.

475
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:44,500
We're really thankful. Just a little bean curd will do... was this made in the morning?

476
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,040
Yes, this morning.

477
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,430
What time did you wake up to make this?

478
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:51,150
I woke up around five in the morning to do this.

479
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,530
It smells wonderful.

480
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,980
It's so fragrant.

481
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,120
It's the smell of the soy.

482
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,840
Do you make this fresh every morning?

483
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,860
No, not every day.

484
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:10,660
Is there an occasion today that you made this for?

485
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,770
No, I just wanted to keep some.

486
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:14,660
Oh, to keep some.

487
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:19,170
This bean curd is really smooth.

488
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:23,670
Thank you so much.

489
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:28,150
Grandma, how should we prepare the bean curd soup to make it delicious?

490
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,930
Just add kimchi.

491
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,540
I'm salivating...

492
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,390
Can we eat it as it is?

493
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:41,070
Of course you can, try a little.

494
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,290
This was freshly made.

495
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:55,970
It's really good, try some.

496
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:58,980
I thought it was milk, really, really.

497
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:02,820
I'm really surprised. I'm having this kind of bean curd for the first time.

498
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:06,330
Hyung, it's like milk, right?

499
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:08,130
It's strange...

500
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:13,660
I'm sorry, this is my first time having such bean curd.

501
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,540
Have you have this before?

502
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,180
Hang on, let me try a little more.

503
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:19,130
<i>This is bean curd, grandma?</i>

504
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:20,790
<i>It is bean curd.</i>

505
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,570
It's really good.

506
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:28,210
There's no need to make soup.

507
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,390
We can just eat it on its own.

508
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:37,180
Like grandma said, just add kimchi on top, we don't need to add anything else to it.

509
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,640
It's already so good.

510
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,690
I really wish you a happy new year, and good health, grandma.

511
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:50,330
We will eat it well, thank you very much!

512
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:06,240
This was made from scratch without preservatives.

513
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:11,030
Since we have this kind of bean curd, we don't really have to do much for breakfast!

514
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:15,000
[3 men totally sold on this delicious bean curd]

515
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,150
-To describe such good bean curd in words is quite a feat

516
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,500
Is this the co-op center?

517
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,920
Yes, I saw it yesterday

518
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:28,000
When was that?

519
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:29,300
Yesterday when we were turning again and again

520
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:43,200
These are rations that have been stored up by the villagers

521
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,250
This one, and this one

522
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,600
Hyung, you're too greedy!

523
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,200
-That's enough..this is exactly right

524
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,000
[JH is still blissfully happy, unaware of what's going to happen next]

525
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,250
[The 3 men are home]

526
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,870
They are still sleeping? (dissatisfied)

527
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,250
You're saying that because you hate them?

528
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,430
No, it's not like that..

529
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,400
So, you're just asking in passing, right?

530
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:38,150
I made a long trip to get here yesterday and this morning, had to wake up early to catch the sunrise..

531
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:47,000
In just such a short time, I could feel the depth of our friendship..

532
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,140
..I got to know everyone all over again.

533
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,500
Learning to handle the hardship.

534
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,000
If we do anything, we all have to do it!

535
00:37:55,100 --> 00:38:05,000
Even when guests are selected to cook, go to the kitchen..get the vegetables..pots..and bring them out here

536
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,750
No, No.

537
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:11,200
Don't misunderstand..I'll work as well

538
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:16,750
Eversince the CTH episode, things are a bit different

539
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,750
It's not that I don't want to work..

540
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,850
You have also changed quite a bit in a day

541
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,700
People will change?!

542
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:26,700
[Speechless...]

543
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,500
That's right, people do change.

544
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:33,450
Yesterday after picking the herbs, he wasn't even like this!

545
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:36,200
It's not that.I'm only saying this now..

546
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:37,950
Whatever it is, I feel sorry towards you for yesterday!-

547
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Hwang Yi, really! I said that when I came through that door, right!

548
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:48,250
Is he really the kind of person who harping on stuff?

549
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,500
The Hwang Yi incident..I can understand

550
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,500
So..i guess I'll have to go in and get all the stuff!

551
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,000
Yes. yes.

552
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,000
He'll feel appeased if you do it

553
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,800
We didn't lead hyung to do it, you want to do it out of your own will..

554
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:06,750
That's right! It's not like I'm doing it just because you said to. It has to be brought out anyway.

555
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Thanks, hyung!

556
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:19,400
Chopping well..

557
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,750
That's the way..

558
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:39,000
You two make the pancakes, I will make the soup

559
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,750
Hyung..can you really do it?

560
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,800
Do we have to chop up the kimchi as well?

561
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:58,000
Hyung..chop evenly

562
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,600
As if I don't know I have to chop evenly?

563
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,400
Hyung, for this, I just have to keep stirring?

564
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,000
Yes..mix some more

565
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,750
[Serious]

566
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:47,100
[What's he doing?]

567
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,500
Aiyaa!..Hyuk ah

568
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:04,500
I know, I know..I didn't add oil

569
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,150
It's not whether you have added oil or not, the fire isn't even lit

570
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:17,300
Ah I'm going crazy..Jaesuk, look at this

571
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:22,000
You've got to turn on the burner before adding the mix

572
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:23,000
-Ya, whats the matter..

573
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,750
It's ok without the oil, but the fire isn't even lit

574
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,150
This is really my first time, hyung!

575
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:32,000
Even if this is your first time with making a pancake, with no fire how can you cook the pancake!

576
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,700
Ya, this is so simple

577
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,220
Nobody would want to use the sun's energy..

578
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:41,200
Use the sunrays from above to heat it up?!

579
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:44,000
It's not shining from this side. It's from the other side.

580
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:49,000
[It is this 2% insufficiency that led to the first incident]

581
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,250
Aiyo..really love this scent

582
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,000
Ya, the bean curd soup

583
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,250
No,hyung. Look at the kimchi

584
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,000
Look at the bean curd..

585
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,400
[ After awhile, it's back to bickering ]

586
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,000
I won't let you eat this then

587
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,000
I was the one who got this, why aren't you giving it to me!

588
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Have a look at my kimchi

589
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,500
Can you shoot this way?

590
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:22,200
Cameraman, look at this! It's as good as at dinner time!

591
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:27,900
Ahh Jaesuk-ah! How can you fry it on its own like that? You have to fry it with sesame oil

592
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I was just about to say that

593
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:32,000
What do you mean?

594
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,300
[After JH, now it's JS's turn..What's happening today~]

JaeSuk! really..

596
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:43,910
Put this first. Then this, then mix them together

597
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,300
Have to put this later? Can't put it now?

598
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,510
Do you have to fry the kimchi again?

599

[ With such good bean curd, nothing can really go wrong. Today's breakfast will be a good one]

[At this moment, finishing off the remaining bean curd]

602

These have gone bad..bad.

604
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,550
Then just leave it there, why are you still eating it

605
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,610
I'm afraid it'll get into yours

606

Oh, really

607
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:26,710

You want me to do this?

610
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:33,500
I'll fry this.

00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:52,360
Hyung, You go over to your side.

616
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,610
Just for a little while

617
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,250
We can still eat the kimchi, just cut it. That should do.

Hyuk ah, look and listen carefully..

633
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:09,260
There are 2 kinds of oil, sesame oil and vegetable oil. What did I use when frying the kimchi?

634
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:10,800
Sesame oil!

635
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:12,850

00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,000
Jaesuk ah..

646
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:21,810
What?

647
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:24,850
There's no flavor to it..

648
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:30,750
[Such good bean curd with no flavor?]

649
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,850
Grandma gave us good bean curd

650
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,710
Let me try

651
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:41,960
Why does it become worse after putting in the rest of the ingredients?

652
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:43,490
-It was really good just now?

653
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,900
-We still have the pancake

654
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,200
You guys aren't giving me a spoon!

655
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,800
Ok..try it, try.

656
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,800
Hyung, this is really too much.. this...

657
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:06,900
Hey, we already added everything... what else is there?

658
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:06,700
Besides adding those ingredients, I didn't do much to it! It's not salty..it's not spicy..

659
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:08,700
Is this salt?

660
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:10,580
I don't think adding salt will solve the problem here

661
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:13,450
It's not good to add too much salt

662
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:17,700
Let's try improving it with salt..even if it's not good, there should be some flavor to it

663
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,800
[Seems the outcome is not too favorable]

664
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:37,140
Now, are your hands a little itchy? Said we shouldn't use that thing... but we have already tolerated it for so long…

665
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:54,180
[The 2 men got tempted]

666
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:56,580
[This guy is oblivious to what's going on..]

667
00:47:58,260 --> 00:47:59,790
Be gentle..

668
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:01,950
I's too thick

669
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:02,870
[Looking at the pancake, there is not much hope]

670
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:09,240
[Suddenly, he picks up the fried kimchi]

671
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:15,930
You're not flipping the pancake?!

672
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:19,550
If I flip it, it'll tear..it's not time to flip it yet

673
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:29,800
Have you seen the female fox coming in search of her food yet?

674
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:36,620
I've seen the old fox looking for food

675
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:43,440
[Totally engrossed]

676
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:48,250
Is this how it's done?

677
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,010
It has to be good

678
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:03,560
[Even the color changed]

679
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:15,170
Give me a bite too

680
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:20,980
It's here..!

681
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:28,760
The taste is here..

682
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:32,640
It's good..add a bit more

683
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:42,510
It's a lot better than it was just now

684
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,450
The flavor grows on you

685
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:50,520
Yes..definitely..

686
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,390
[Eating ramen flavored soup from elderly?!]

687
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:56,890
[Whatever it is, they are relieved about the soup]

688
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:01,830
What are you doing?

689
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:05,510
I'm trying to wrap this up..

690
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:06,940
It's not like that..

691
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:10,850
[2% insufficient JH makes a mistake again]

692
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:13,540
Hyung, I'll do a good one for you to see..

693
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,870
What are you doing?

694
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:25,630
Initially, we wanted pancake but I see it's not possible now..

695
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:36,200
How is it?

696
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:37,880
Be truthful

697
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:42,260
We have to save this with the 2nd pancake..

698
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:44,570
Is it really that serious?

699
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:54,260
It's not good, right?

700
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,820
Don't reprimand him, hyung..let the guest feel more welcome..

701
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,820
If you're nice..it's good?

702
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:02,380
I can be more frank..

703
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,700
Don't be too frank..

704
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:10,570
This is my first time having such a hard time eating this type of pancake

705
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:18,950
[Sad]

706
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,630
Let's not talk about this, let's talk about our soup

707
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,630
Hyung, try this..you can't be like hyung and make stuff all nice and delicious?

708
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:37,570
I already failed..

709
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:42,380
Hyuk, how is it?

710
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,760
Oh! This taste..is good..

711
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:49,420
[Forgot his sadness, there's even life in the way he speaks]

712
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:57,870
The flavor of all soups can be enhanced..

713
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:02,580
Let's not make pancake..

714
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,460
Hyung, you do it..

715
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:10,210
Can't boil the soup for too long; if it stands for too long the flavor won't be as good.

716
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:13,390
Get the table and cutlery from the kitchen and arrange them..I'll do it quickly

717
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:21,360
Fry more?

718
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:23,230
It's ok..

[A gentle touch]

[Looks like the real thing]

721
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:43,750
Hyuk ahh..I'm sorry..can you cut up more kimchi?

722
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:48,440
You don't have to chop it finely..like this will do

723
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:57,390
Hyuk looks quite disappointed with the pancake..now that it is unsuccessful

724
00:52:57,770 --> 00:53:01,520
He was humbled.

725
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,840
It's possible that he was hurt

726

[Sooro looks for a plate for the pancake]

There's a new plate here..

00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:46,860
Janghyuk is now so obedient..suddenly..a change of attitude

[Finishes it easily]

736

Look at this..the most-difficult-to-make kind of pancake

737
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:08,210
When should we do this..?

738
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:09,460
Now..

739
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:19,520
This is also my first time doing this..

740
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,210
How should we wrap this up and eat it?

741
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:35,520
Hmm...this is the taste..it's really good

Hyuk ah..why are you looking on so forlornly? You had a confident look just now

See that? Writing?

750

[I've seen through you!]

752

Hyuk..smile! The pancake is going to burn because of your intense gaze..

753
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,960
Ehh..beautiful!

767
00:56:50,990 --> 00:57:06,530
Today we went through lots of incidents, from when the soup didn't taste good to making it good..let's hear a little about the pancake..

768
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:09,670
The hardest part about making the pancake was..

The beginning part was very difficult..

770

Yes, later on..after gaining strength from the Family, the final product was a success

I would like to say that teacher Sooro has the highest skill in making pancakes among the family members

So now, we complete our soup and pancake breakfast!

What are your feelings today? Please answer simply

777

Initially, I thought I could do it..thought that with a competitive streak

778
00:57:55,290 --> 00:58:12,730
To cook breakfast with me, that was a good choice

779
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:22,050
No matter what, the breakfast is done..now 3 of us, let's shout "Long Life!"
