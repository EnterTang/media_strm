331
00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:04,384
我对这顿晚饭好期待啊
Oh, I'm so excited for this dinner.

332
00:11:04,386 --> 00:11:05,886
是啊 但是你俩
Yeah, hey, how did you two

333
00:11:05,888 --> 00:11:08,039
是怎么在Rolin and Jones订到位子的
get reservations to Rolin and Jones anyway?

334
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,526
我听说已经排到一年后了
I heard there was a one-year wait.

335
00:11:09,646 --> 00:11:10,724
其实挺好订的
No, no, it was easy.

336
00:11:10,726 --> 00:11:12,818
那里的厨师追尾了我们的车 我们没叫警察
The chef rear-ended us and we didn't call the police.

337
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,607
他说他喝了一点点烹调酒
Yeah, he said he'd just had a little bit of cooking wine,

338
00:11:14,637 --> 00:11:16,349
不过我能看到他鼻子呼出的可卡因
but I could see some cooking cocaine around his nose.

340
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,532
你俩不尴尬吧
This isn't awkward for you guys, is it?

341
00:11:19,534 --> 00:11:20,834
还是分手后太快再聚在一起了
Because it's so soon after your break-up?

342
00:11:20,836 --> 00:11:22,299
- 没有 - 没有
- No! - No, no.

343
00:11:22,419 --> 00:11:23,970
我们约会前就是朋友
I mean, we were friends before we were dating,

344
00:11:23,972 --> 00:11:25,640
我们觉得我们还能做朋友
so we thought we can do that again.

345
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,543
- 是的 - 是的
- Yeah. - Yeah.

346
00:11:27,076 --> 00:11:28,162
你们有没有人注意到
Have any of you noticed

347
00:11:28,181 --> 00:11:28,875
我们已经五分钟
we haven't moved

348
00:11:28,877 --> 00:11:29,843
没有动过了
in five minutes?

349
00:11:29,845 --> 00:11:31,059
- 没有动过 - 是的
- No. - Hmm.

350
00:11:31,093 --> 00:11:32,261
可能出事故了
Must be an accident.

351
00:11:32,277 --> 00:11:33,213
我去看一下
Yeah, I'll go check it out.

352
00:11:33,242 --> 00:11:34,266
反正我也要去小便
I got to pee anyway.

353
00:11:38,928 --> 00:11:40,086
车库
How's, uh,

354
00:11:40,088 --> 00:11:41,321
怎么样
the garage?

355
00:11:41,323 --> 00:11:42,522
- 很暖和 - 很冷
- Warm. - Cozy?

356
00:11:42,524 --> 00:11:43,757
- 很暖和 - 是的
- Yeah, warm? - Yeah.

357
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:46,293
他们可不是朋友
Hey, they're not friends.

358
00:11:46,515 --> 00:11:47,928
你说什么呢 他俩很好啊
What are you talking about? They're fine.

359
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,696
不好意思 他俩不可能是朋友
Exes, they can't be friends.

360
00:11:49,698 --> 00:11:51,064
你不接
You getting a call?

361
00:11:51,569 --> 00:11:52,136
我过会儿回过去
I'll call back.

362
00:11:53,068 --> 00:11:54,367
没事的 你可以出去接的
Nah, it's okay. You can take it outside.

363
00:11:54,421 --> 00:11:56,069
我的意思是 不关我们的事
I mean, none of our business, right?

364
00:11:56,071 --> 00:11:57,070
没事的
No, it... it's fine.

366
00:11:58,273 --> 00:11:59,139
没事
It's fine.

367
00:12:00,366 --> 00:12:01,220
很有趣吧
Is it fine?

368
00:12:07,574 --> 00:12:08,780
好吧
All right, well,

369
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,520
看来得等一阵子了
looks like this is gonna take a while.

370
00:12:10,556 --> 00:12:11,870
总统在这附近做募捐
They got a bunch of streets blocked off

371
00:12:11,905 --> 00:12:14,120
他们封锁了几条街道
because the president's having a fund-raiser in the area.

372
00:12:14,469 --> 00:12:16,890
我猜特勤局
And I guess the Secret Service apparently

373
00:12:16,892 --> 00:12:19,297
对站街的玩笑已经不感兴趣了
doesn't like hooker jokes anymore.

374
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:28,457
这太有趣了 我觉得很有趣
Well, this is fun. I'm having fun.

375
00:12:28,577 --> 00:12:29,803
是的 特别有趣
Yeah, so-so fun.

376
00:12:29,923 --> 00:12:31,944
- 很有趣 - 我好饿啊
- So fun. - I am so hungry.

377
00:12:31,979 --> 00:12:33,340
我后备箱的救急箱里面
Hey, I've got granola bars

378
00:12:33,342 --> 00:12:35,108
有燕麦棒
in the emergency kit back there!

379
00:12:35,112 --> 00:12:36,828
- 太好了 - 太好了 Heather
- Oh, yes. - Yes, Heather!

380
00:12:36,866 --> 00:12:37,380
我已经三天没吃饭了
I haven't eaten in, like, three days...

381
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:38,239
拿出来 拿出来
Oh, get' em out, get' em out.

382
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,879
大餐啊
waiting for this dinner.

385
00:12:42,884 --> 00:12:46,286
我欠你一条燕麦棒 Tim
"I. O. U. One granola bar. Tim."

386
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:50,592
我欠你
Uh, "I. O. U.

387
00:12:50,712 --> 00:12:52,392
一条燕麦棒
One granola bar.

388
00:12:52,909 --> 00:12:53,626
Tim
Tim."

389
00:12:53,628 --> 00:12:56,162
我欠你一卷卫生纸
"I. O. U. A toilet paper.

390
00:12:57,121 --> 00:12:57,526
Tim
Tim."

391
00:12:59,955 --> 00:13:00,567
好吧
Oh, you know what?

392
00:13:00,569 --> 00:13:02,402
我这次要接了
Uh, I better take it this time.

393
00:13:06,071 --> 00:13:06,906
你好
Hello.

394
00:13:06,908 --> 00:13:08,408
- 很奇怪 - 怎么了
- That's weird. - Yeah?

395
00:13:09,024 --> 00:13:09,876
要开始了
Here it comes.

396
00:13:09,878 --> 00:13:11,878
我打算假装在读操作指南
I'm just gonna pretend to read this manual.

397
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,466
电话太私人了还得出去接
It's so private she has to take it outside?

398
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:15,215
是吗
Right?

399
00:13:16,455 --> 00:13:17,050
我是说
I'm just saying

400
00:13:17,052 --> 00:13:18,347
这对你们来说太没礼貌了 不是吗
that's rude to you guys, right?

401
00:13:18,887 --> 00:13:20,662
我是说 当你坐到一个车里面
I mean, 'cause when... when you get into a car with people,

402
00:13:20,854 --> 00:13:22,222
有一条不成文的规定就是
there's a sort of unwritten contract

403
00:13:22,224 --> 00:13:23,842
你得跟人们一起呆在车里
that you're gonna stay in the car with the people,

404
00:13:23,877 --> 00:13:25,925
忠于这辆车和车里面的人
be loyal to the car and-and the people,

405
00:13:25,927 --> 00:13:28,778
而不是出门离开这辆车
and not, like, get out and walk away from a car.

406
00:13:28,801 --> 00:13:32,532
这辆车有车载WIFI热点
Oh, hey, uh, this car's got its own Wi-Fi hotspot.

407
00:13:32,785 --> 00:13:33,697
- 是的 - 你知道吗
- Yeah. - You know what?

408
00:13:33,721 --> 00:13:35,238
我还得去小便
I got to whizz again.

409
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,905
我有个猫头鹰的膀胱
I go the bladder of an owl,

410
00:13:36,934 --> 00:13:38,605
我想应该是很小的吧
which I imagine's pretty small.

411
00:13:38,607 --> 00:13:40,106
这是真的
Man, that's true.

412
00:13:40,325 --> 00:13:43,011
坐个电梯的时间他都憋不住
Even elevator rides are very difficult for him.

413
00:13:51,258 --> 00:13:51,735
还好吗
Everything okay?

414
00:13:51,855 --> 00:13:53,213
- 还好 - 还好
- Yeah, fine. - Yeah, good.

415
00:13:53,243 --> 00:13:54,073
只是个朋友
That was just a friend?

416
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:56,456
不是吧 Matt 你真想知道我跟谁打电话
Really, Matt? You really need to know who I was talking to?

417
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:57,472
- 不想知道 -是吗
- No, I don't. - Hmm.

418
00:13:57,481 --> 00:13:58,694
- 是的 不关我事 - 好吧
- No, it's none of my business. - Okay.

419
00:13:58,711 --> 00:13:59,837
- 是不关你事 - 我只是觉得
- Nope. - I mean, is it rude

420
00:14:00,211 --> 00:14:01,262
跟朋友和家人一起出去的时候
to get out of a car

421
00:14:01,654 --> 00:14:04,234
到车外面接电话
and take a phone call, you know, w... when you're hanging out

422
00:14:04,264 --> 00:14:05,595
是很没有礼貌的
with your friend and his family? I don't know.

423
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:06,499
天知地知你知我知
That's between you and the Lord.

424
00:14:06,868 --> 00:14:10,105
Heather 车载WIFI的密码是什么
Hey, uh, Heather, what is the, uh, the WiFi password here?

425
00:14:10,123 --> 00:14:13,039
我要看一些划水失败的视频
I want to watch some, uh, waterslide fail videos.

426
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:16,766
密码是HotforHeater69
It's, uh, it's, uh, HotforHeater69.

427
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:19,712
我想起来低血糖Matt了
Oh, I remember Low Blood Sugar Matt.

428
00:14:19,714 --> 00:14:20,792
- 你记得他 是吗 - 是啊
- You remember this guy? Do you? - Yeah.

429
00:14:20,912 --> 00:14:21,541
- 是吗 - 记得很清楚
- Yeah? - Real well.

430
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:22,449
他跟你爸像吗
Is he anything like your dad?

431
00:14:22,451 --> 00:14:23,883
因为如果有相似点的话 也许你应该跟他分手
Cause if he is, you should probably break up with him.

432
00:14:23,885 --> 00:14:24,818
这就是他跟我分手的原因
See, that's why she broke up with me.

433
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,252
- 天啊 - 你们俩
- Wow. - Hey, you guys,

434
00:14:26,254 --> 00:14:27,436
看看这个
can I draw your attention to this?

435
00:14:27,483 --> 00:14:28,198
看这个地图
Check out this map.

436
00:14:28,245 --> 00:14:31,224
我能缩小到能看到Hawwii呢
I can zoom all the way over to Hawaii. Look.

437
00:14:31,226 --> 00:14:32,459
你知道吗 Matt
You know what, Matt? This is not the time

438
00:14:32,461 --> 00:14:33,593
现在的时间和地点都不适合讨论这个
or the place to get into this.

439
00:14:33,595 --> 00:14:34,476
- 不适合吗 -不适合
- Is it not? - No, it's not.

440
00:14:34,484 --> 00:14:35,464
是吗 你的小朋友打回来了么
No. Is your little friend calling back?

441
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:36,963
他不是我的小朋友
He's not my little friend.

442
00:14:36,965 --> 00:14:38,331
- 所以是个男的了 - 是啊
- No, but... so it is a he? - Mm-hmm.

443
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:39,575
- 他不小 - 喂
- And he's not little? - Hey!

444
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:40,997
你吃什么呢
What did you just eat?

445
00:14:42,694 --> 00:14:43,903
- 没什么 - 张开嘴
- Nothing. - Open it.

446
00:14:43,905 --> 00:14:44,895
- 你吃什么呢 - 走开
- What are you eating? - Go away!

447
00:14:44,942 --> 00:14:45,701
好了我承认
Stop, I'll tell!

448
00:14:46,327 --> 00:14:48,361
我在外套里找到一片
I found one of Lark's teething biscuits

449
00:14:48,398 --> 00:14:49,275
Lark的磨牙饼干
in my jacket.

450
00:14:49,395 --> 00:14:50,067
什么
What?

451
00:14:50,118 --> 00:14:51,830
有一半是我的 还给我
That's half mine! Give me that.

452
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:53,146
想喂小鸟一样喂给我
Spit it into my mouth like a baby bird.

453
00:14:53,148 --> 00:14:54,120
你知道吗
You know what? I thought that

454
00:14:54,134 --> 00:14:55,372
我以为跟你做朋友比什么都不是好点
being friends with you would actually be better

455
00:14:55,386 --> 00:14:57,186
但并不是 这感觉太糟了
than nothing, but... news flash... it isn't. This sucks.

456
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,219
你以为跟你做朋友像公园散步那么简单
You think being friends with you is a walk in the park?

457
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,020
你的性格太消极抵抗了
You are so passive-aggressive

458
00:15:01,022 --> 00:15:02,175
有时我都分不清
that sometimes I can't tell

459
00:15:02,189 --> 00:15:03,990
我是在跟你说话还是跟你妈说话
if I'm talking to you or your mother.

460
00:15:03,992 --> 00:15:05,007
别提我妈
No, you did not just bring my mother into this!
461
00:15:05,023 --> 00:15:06,077
我就说
I said your mother,

462
00:15:06,095 --> 00:15:06,796
因为你知道我是对的
because you know it's true!

463
00:15:06,813 --> 00:15:07,838
我提她
I did bring her up...

464
00:15:07,868 --> 00:15:09,262
- 是因为她和你 - 天啊
- because she and you... - Oh, my goodness gracious.

465
00:15:11,251 --> 00:15:13,323
我觉得有时候我们在交谈
I feel like sometimes we're talking at each other.

466
00:15:13,443 --> 00:15:14,467
但你从来不听
You never listen.

467
00:15:17,539 --> 00:15:19,204
天啊
Oh, God... !

468
00:15:19,975 --> 00:15:21,875
这好像是我有过的最糟的主意
This is, like, the worst idea I've ever had in my...

469
00:15:21,877 --> 00:15:22,941
我们永远不可能做朋友
We could never be friends!

470
00:15:22,957 --> 00:15:25,126
- 太悲哀了 - 是啊
- So sad. - Oh, I know.

471
00:15:25,148 --> 00:15:26,746
他们以前在一起的时候多好
They were so good together.

472
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:27,730
不好
