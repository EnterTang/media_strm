(Tale of The Nine Tailed)

2
00:01:00,368 --> 00:01:01,438
Does it not hurt anymore?

3
00:01:04,169 --> 00:01:05,239
Look at me.

4
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:17,348
Long time no see, Yeon.

5
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,348
Long time no see, Yeon.

6
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:22,889
She's mine.

7
00:01:22,889 --> 00:01:24,119
She's mine.

8
00:01:33,528 --> 00:01:34,668
How does it feel?

9
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:38,109
After a whole 600 years,

10
00:01:38,109 --> 00:01:41,638
you face your enemy through the body of the woman you love.

11
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,079
Ji A...

12
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:46,649
Where is she?

13
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:49,719
Right here. She lies inside me.

14
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:52,719
She screams in agony...

15
00:01:52,848 --> 00:01:56,359
while resenting her inevitable fate.

16
00:01:56,419 --> 00:01:57,689
Let me ask you this, then.

17
00:01:58,389 --> 00:01:59,859
Who was the other guy...

18
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:03,999
and what exactly are you?

19
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:05,329
This is all your doing.

20
00:02:06,699 --> 00:02:09,299
If you had let her be sacrificed in the island's well,

21
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:13,669
we would've stayed as one, not be split into two.

22
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:16,609
Though when the times comes, we'll unite.

23
00:02:18,809 --> 00:02:22,478
And when exactly will that happen?

24
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:27,618
When we jump into your body instead.

25
00:02:29,118 --> 00:02:31,329
What's with your obsession over my body?

26
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:34,999
Why can't you unite in another's and live happily ever after?

27
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:38,499
Are you not aware of the speed it grows?

28
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:42,269
Could it be...

29
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:45,139
that you not only grow,

30
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:47,809
but also age as fast?

31
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,909
That's the curse laid on you.

32
00:02:53,348 --> 00:02:56,919
I came across one opportunity to change my fate.

33
00:02:57,478 --> 00:02:59,019
By becoming a dragon?

34
00:02:59,618 --> 00:03:01,359
If I had,

35
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,789
I'd have been the spirit of Baekdudaegan, not you.

36
00:03:05,428 --> 00:03:06,629
So what you want is revenge.

37
00:03:09,058 --> 00:03:11,229
That's why out of all the immortal bodies,

38
00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:13,199
you're after mine.

39
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:17,539
Just so you know, now that I'm finally dominant,

40
00:03:17,868 --> 00:03:19,539
she'll soon fade away.

41
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:21,609
- I'll kill you. - If you do,

42
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,109
she'll die too.

43
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,579
And saving her will lead to your death.

44
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:32,889
Will you save her or save yourself?

45
00:03:38,688 --> 00:03:40,058
I hate to tell you this,

46
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:43,958
but none of the above is what we want.

47
00:03:52,738 --> 00:03:54,539
Yap all you want.

48
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:57,208
I won't let you touch this body.

49
00:04:07,718 --> 00:04:08,859
You're weak.

50
00:04:09,618 --> 00:04:10,688
What?

51
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:14,458
Does it weaken you to be dominant in her body?

52
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,299
Most of the Imoogi's strength and abilities lie with him.

53
00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:20,199
You're only the heart, so to speak.

54
00:04:20,868 --> 00:04:23,099
That's why you need Ji A as your shield...

55
00:04:23,738 --> 00:04:25,968
to prevent me from knowing how weak you are.

56
00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:33,579
You two can't change the inevitable.

57
00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:39,988
With you gone, it'll be over. Just you.

58
00:04:44,188 --> 00:04:47,428
And you're the only one I need, Ji A.

59
00:04:49,028 --> 00:04:50,428
Please.

60
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:53,528
Just give up that body of yours and die.

61
00:05:06,109 --> 00:05:07,249
Ji A,

62
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:11,048
I know you can hear me.

63
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:14,619
I know you're there.

64
00:05:15,059 --> 00:05:16,319
Shut it.

65
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:17,658
Come back to me.

66
00:05:19,658 --> 00:05:22,429
I'll always be waiting for you,

67
00:05:25,598 --> 00:05:27,228
so come back to me.

68
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:31,038
I'll always be waiting for you.

69
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,809
I've been waiting for you too.

70
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:38,978
When it comes to waiting, no one can do it better.

71
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:42,348
24 hours? I could sit there even for 24 years.

72
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:45,788
I had a feeling that I could meet you here.

73
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:49,718
I'll always be by your side.

74
00:05:54,158 --> 00:05:56,559
I'm yours till death do us part.

75
00:06:11,608 --> 00:06:12,708
Yeon...

76
00:06:34,398 --> 00:06:36,999
Yes, it's me. I'm right here.

77
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,879
Help me, Yeon.

78
00:06:47,809 --> 00:06:49,319
Just kill me instead.

79
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:53,088
So that I never hurt you.

80
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:07,798
Ji A, it's all right.

81
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:11,168
It'll all be all right.

82
00:07:13,108 --> 00:07:20,408
(Chapter 13: The Other Imoogi)

83
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,088
Dr. Koo, thank you for today. You saved us.

84
00:07:29,288 --> 00:07:31,759
Thank Mr. Lee Yeon, not me.

85
00:07:31,989 --> 00:07:33,389
Take care then, guys.

86
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:36,798
Mr. Lee!

87
00:07:40,499 --> 00:07:41,538
I'll be right there.

88
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,838
Yeon or the Imoogi, none of them matter to me.

89
00:07:48,978 --> 00:07:50,478
All I need are the ground cherries.

90
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:52,879
Just the ground cherries!

91
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:54,778
Hey, there.

92
00:07:58,489 --> 00:08:01,189
One shouldn't be so rough in the driver's seat.

93
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:04,958
- Who are you? - The name's Hyeonuiong.

94
00:08:05,288 --> 00:08:07,259
I'm here to retrieve the ground cherries.

95
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:10,228
Who sent you? Imoogi? Lee Yeon?

96
00:08:10,358 --> 00:08:11,769
How's that of importance?

97
00:08:11,869 --> 00:08:13,769
What matters is that this doesn't belong to you.

98
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:14,869
Stop talking nonsense.

99
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:18,708
The ground cherries are mine. They're mine!

100
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,121
Gosh, that hurt so much.

101
00:08:22,621 --> 00:08:24,650
I hate the smell of gunpowder.

102
00:08:25,361 --> 00:08:29,830
Listen to me. You shouldn't fight against fate.

103
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,330
What? Are you also a monster?

104
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,601
My goodness.

105
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,900
It looks like we'll meet again pretty soon.

106
00:08:49,351 --> 00:08:50,450

(Shin Ju's Animal Hospital)

108
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,951
So right now, she's Director Nam, right?

109
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,631
But who knows when she might turn into Imoogi and attack you again?

110
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:37,890
I let him hurt me.

111
00:09:40,601 --> 00:09:41,660
What?

112
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,400
I wanted to check.

113
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,510
The fact that Imoogi split into two could be his strength,

114
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,550
but it could also be a fatal weakness.

115
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:58,211
What do you mean?

116
00:09:58,211 --> 00:09:59,780
The Imoogi inside Ji A's body...

117
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,491
is a little different from the one I've seen until now.

118
00:10:02,491 --> 00:10:04,520
They're both the same Imoogi but a little different?

119
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,390
This one is a lot more similar to the Imoogi from my past life.

120
00:10:10,231 --> 00:10:11,530
What can I do to help?

121
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,930
Go meet the Snail Bride and ask her about the fortune teller.

122
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,071
The guy who took the fox bead?

123
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,780
Should I turn them back into humans?

124
00:10:30,211 --> 00:10:33,420
Check the list and turn only those who still have lives left to live.

125
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,121
It'll be tiring to turn them all into humans at once.

126
00:10:35,121 --> 00:10:37,851
Okay, got it. But let's eat first.

127
00:10:37,991 --> 00:10:39,560
Honey, should I buy you tteokbokki?

128
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,020
How about I add some fritters and sundae as well?

129
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,461
I also want extra cheese.

130
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,160
Okay, I'll add extra mozzarella cheese.

131
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,400
And as for spiciness, I'll order level three for you,

132
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,601
and I'll get myself a level one.

Even so,

139
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:19,160
I'd still choose her.

I'm sorry.

143
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,060
You don't need to apologize.

144
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,831
With my own hands...

145
00:11:52,961 --> 00:11:54,930
I stabbed you with my own hands...

146
00:11:55,831 --> 00:11:57,201
and hurt you.

147
00:12:02,971 --> 00:12:06,280
I know better than anyone that it wasn't you.

148
00:12:09,381 --> 00:12:11,581
Look at me.

149
00:12:19,121 --> 00:12:21,491
How do you feel? Are you okay?

150
00:12:22,831 --> 00:12:24,731
How could you possibly be worried about me...

151
00:12:26,001 --> 00:12:27,430
when you were the one who got hurt?

152
00:12:27,631 --> 00:12:28,800
Want some coffee?

153
00:12:32,371 --> 00:12:33,540
Or how about chicken feet?

154
00:12:35,471 --> 00:12:36,571
No.

155
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,140
Do you want me to take you home?

156
00:12:41,711 --> 00:12:42,981
I don't think I can go home.

157
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,420
What if I change like I did earlier...

158
00:12:47,481 --> 00:12:49,420
and hurt my parents?

159
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,660
Then I might really go crazy.

160
00:13:02,831 --> 00:13:05,670
Then should we go somewhere instead?

161

Yes, let's go somewhere.

162

Let's go to a place where it'll just be the two of us.

Don't worry too much about your parents.

Thank you.

167
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,410
Wherever.

168
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:03,260
Do you remember when we first met?

169
00:14:05,231 --> 00:14:06,400
When you were a little kid?

170
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,331
No.

171
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,201
Of course, I remember.

172
00:14:12,071 --> 00:14:14,640
All my life, my job was to chase after people.

173
00:14:15,571 --> 00:14:19,280
You were the first person to chase after me instead.

174
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,481
I should've just asked you out then.

175
00:14:25,981 --> 00:14:30,420
Then we would've been able to enjoy our time together...

176
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,290
for a lot longer.

177
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:46,040
Darn it!

178
00:14:57,251 --> 00:14:58,951
Were you going somewhere?

179
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,160
Forgive me. I must've been crazy.

180
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,201
I was blinded by the ground cherries. I was out of my mind!

181
00:15:14,631 --> 00:15:15,770
Look at me.

182
00:15:21,341 --> 00:15:24,211
You were born as a servant in a filthy thatched house.

183
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,280
And you've come a long way since then.

184
00:15:28,381 --> 00:15:29,851
It's... It's all thanks to you.

185
00:15:29,851 --> 00:15:33,520
I saved you right before you were about to get executed for treason.

186
00:15:34,251 --> 00:15:36,451
Yes, how will I ever forget?

187
00:15:36,451 --> 00:15:37,621
Then...

188
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:41,190
why did you help Lee Yeon?

189
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,400
I heard you told him a lot of stuff.

190
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:55,640
Please... Please show me mercy and give me another chance.

191
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,770
No, there's no need.

192
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,310
I no longer need...

193
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,680
anything or anyone.

194
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,081
There's been a change of plans.

195
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:07,481
Pardon?

196
00:16:12,821 --> 00:16:15,260
I want you to become miserable.

197
00:16:17,631 --> 00:16:19,961
And I mean, every single person who's alive right now.

198
00:16:26,841 --> 00:16:28,001
Go and turn yourself in.

199
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,280
You're better off living as a criminal.

200
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,251
Should we play a game?

201
00:16:45,821 --> 00:16:46,861
What game?

202
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:51,160
Like you said earlier, let's pretend like we don't know anything.

203
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,231
How exactly?

204
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,800
You're just an average person who's bored of your dull...

205
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,971
and ordinary life.

206
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,440
And as for me,

207
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,040
let's say I'm not a nine-tailed fox.

208
00:17:05,741 --> 00:17:07,680
Do we know each other?

209
00:17:10,081 --> 00:17:11,150
We're...

210
00:17:13,121 --> 00:17:14,680
married. We're a married couple.

211
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:16,951
We're just an average couple.

212
00:17:17,751 --> 00:17:19,560
Let's say you went to work as usual,

213
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,390
and I'm waiting for you to come home as I cook dinner.

214
00:17:21,461 --> 00:17:23,190
- What do you think? - So I'm the breadwinner?

215
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:26,131
I own tons of buildings and have a lot of cash.

216
00:17:26,331 --> 00:17:29,300
I just want to be a house husband who gets paid rent every month.

217
00:17:30,971 --> 00:17:33,701
Don't laugh. Try being serious.

218
00:17:33,701 --> 00:17:35,341
What do you want me to do?

219
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,440
Just a second.

220
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,540
Wait here for a moment.

221
00:17:47,751 --> 00:17:49,991
Okay, now come home from work.

222
00:17:50,451 --> 00:17:51,591
Go on. Come home from work.

223
00:17:53,461 --> 00:17:55,460
Gosh, this feels stupid.

224
00:18:04,131 --> 00:18:05,940
I'm home.

225
00:18:07,871 --> 00:18:08,970
Honey.

226
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,311
"Honey, I'm home"?

227
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,579
Is my little puppy mad?

228
00:18:15,879 --> 00:18:17,210
Why are you mad?

229
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,250
Look at the time.

230
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,990
You always say it's normal for a woman to come home late...

231
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,520
because you're out there working.

232
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,690
Did you or did you not promise to be home by midnight?

233
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:28,990
Did you promise me or not?

234
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,789
- Do I have a curfew? - Yes.

235
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:33,530
You broke curfew twice last month too.

236
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,230
Are promises to me unimportant?

237
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:38,329
I did, didn't I? Can you forgive me just this once?

238
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,839
This just won't do. Take a seat.

239
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:47,109
Sit. Let's talk.

240
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:49,879
Honey. You finally got sober not long ago.

241
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,849
Me?

242
00:18:55,789 --> 00:18:57,690
You're creating the background story too.

243
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:00,260
Darling, you've changed.

244
00:19:00,819 --> 00:19:02,059
Do you even love me?

245
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,799
I love you.

246
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,569
Me too.

247
00:19:14,139 --> 00:19:15,869
Are we making up now?

248
00:19:16,639 --> 00:19:19,240
Of course. Our fights never last...

249
00:19:19,639 --> 00:19:21,010
more than five minutes.

250
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,289
It's not fair.

251
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:35,160
Why can't we even have an ordinary life like this?

252
00:19:38,899 --> 00:19:40,559
It's so unfair.

253
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,839
It would've been so nice...

254
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,510
if you were human...

255
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,149
and we were really married...

256
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,349
If Imoogi never existed...

257
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,160
If we lived in a world like that...

258
00:20:10,889 --> 00:20:12,430
If I had met you like that...

259
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,440
I'll protect you.

260
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,440
No matter what happens...

261
00:21:32,139 --> 00:21:35,750
when this fight ends, you must stay alive.

262
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:40,950
That's good enough for me.

263
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,700
Regardless of how many times I am reborn,

264
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,329
the world is filled with darkness.

265
00:22:01,139 --> 00:22:02,710
Yeon, I'll show you...

266
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,639
what the world I live in looks like at the end.

267
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:34,700
(Terry)

268
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,750
Hello?

269
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,180
A party will begin.

270
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,889
I don't plan to be nice to you anymore.

271
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,589
Just wait.

272
00:22:56,889 --> 00:22:58,230
I pity you.

273
00:22:58,889 --> 00:23:02,629
You've never learned how to give or receive love.

274
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,629
All you know how to do is threaten people like this.

275
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,270
As you say, I am threatening you.

276
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,010
Because your body will be a ticking time bomb.

277
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,780
Look at yourself.

278
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,819
Soon, that will take full control over your body.

279
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:32,960
When that time comes, you will kill Yeon with your own hands.

280
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,230
Have you lost your mind?

281
00:24:12,899 --> 00:24:15,069
Why are you going through my computer?

282
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,240
What are you thinking? Why are you messing with when she dies?

283
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,879
She's the real thing.

284
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:25,879
The real Imoogi.

285
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,849
What do you mean?

286
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:31,089
The real Imoogi is within her body.

287
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:34,359
We must get rid of that in order to get rid of the one running rampant.

288
00:24:34,859 --> 00:24:38,530
You plan to sacrifice an innocent child to catch Imoogi?

289
00:24:38,789 --> 00:24:40,760
Knowing what she means to Yeon?

290
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,030
I do. I know better than anyone.

291
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:46,039
- So how could you? - That's why I'm doing it.

292
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,839
Yeon can never let her die.

293
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:50,770
Imoogi knows that as well.

294
00:24:50,869 --> 00:24:53,210
What do you think will happen...

295
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,710
if it takes over Yeon's body?

296
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:57,280
You'll kill a person because of something that didn't happen yet?

297
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:00,950
What are you trying to protect by doing that?

298
00:25:01,849 --> 00:25:03,220
This is my job!

299
00:25:03,619 --> 00:25:05,190
Because of that same reason,

300
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,160
our son lost his wife, and we lost our son.

301
00:25:09,859 --> 00:25:13,200
You added her name to the list of the dead then too.

302
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,730
Thanks to that,

303
00:25:15,899 --> 00:25:17,899
our son took his own life,

304
00:25:19,639 --> 00:25:21,240
and we couldn't save his soul yet.

305
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:22,940
Thanks to that, we prevented a pandemic.

306
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,869
Bok Gil can't even be reincarnated!

307
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,579
That was...

308
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,319
his fate.

309
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:39,260
You know, I thought you had changed a little...

310
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:42,319
after losing your child like that.

311
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:46,430
But I was wrong. You haven't changed at all.

312
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:49,970
A much greater calamity will come.

313
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:52,700
- If we don't stop it now... - Fine.

314
00:25:53,139 --> 00:25:54,599
You stop the calamity.

315
00:25:56,109 --> 00:25:57,639
I'll stop you.

316
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:01,639
What are you trying to do?

317
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,450
The moment you change the date that she dies,

318
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:08,180
it's over between us.

319
00:26:46,819 --> 00:26:49,359
I write this as I watch you sleep.

320
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:53,629
I've decided to return to Seoul.

321
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:59,500
The conclusion I made after spending a night here is this.

322
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:04,510
No matter how far we run,

323
00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:07,079
we can't escape.

324
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,990
I'm on the beach.

325
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:20,859
Let's walk together.

326
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:24,990
Let's walk to the end of the beach and go back together.

327
00:27:29,629 --> 00:27:31,829
I'm small and powerless.

328
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:35,299
The weight of my destiny is too much to bear.

329
00:27:36,109 --> 00:27:39,539
I feel like I'll sink to the bottom of that ocean.

330
00:27:42,109 --> 00:27:45,849
But Yeon, you push me up like a buoy.

331
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,619
You make me float.

332
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,589
You make sure I don't sink.

333
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:06,539
I vowed to give her...

334
00:28:07,339 --> 00:28:10,670
the gift of a boring...

335
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:14,879
and warm life...

336
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,210
that normal people live,

337
00:28:19,109 --> 00:28:20,379
but down by the beach,

338
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,319
this is how she replied.

339
00:28:24,819 --> 00:28:26,359
"Not alone."

340
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,260
She wishes to die together...

341
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,930
and live together.

342
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,329
However,

343
00:28:37,369 --> 00:28:38,799
that seems to be a promise...

344
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,670
I can't make.

345
00:28:49,567 --> 00:28:50,867
Save Mr. Lee.

346
00:28:51,367 --> 00:28:53,466
I tried everything, but to no avail.

347
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:55,236
Why should I?

348
00:28:57,567 --> 00:28:59,607
Why must I help you?

349
00:28:59,837 --> 00:29:02,307
Because I stabbed him on your command.

350
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:03,577
This is your responsibility too.

351
00:29:05,006 --> 00:29:07,117
What do you think I even am?

352
00:29:07,216 --> 00:29:08,916
The owner of the ground cherry tree.

353
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,216
You don't scare me.

354
00:29:13,486 --> 00:29:14,656
And you mean that.

355
00:29:14,656 --> 00:29:17,956
Still, shouldn't a deal be beneficial to me too?

356
00:29:18,087 --> 00:29:20,357
You don't seem to have anything to offer,

357
00:29:21,097 --> 00:29:25,067
and this half-breed is useless to me now.

358
00:29:31,406 --> 00:29:34,037
Take my life in exchange for his.

359
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:35,537
Are you sure?

360
00:29:37,277 --> 00:29:38,347
Just a second.

361
00:29:42,617 --> 00:29:46,047
Mr. Lee, I'll no longer be with you now,

362
00:29:46,617 --> 00:29:47,916
but I wish you a long life.

363
00:29:48,516 --> 00:29:51,926
Don't skip your meals and put on some weight.

364
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:54,857
Stop chasing after your brother too.

365
00:29:58,397 --> 00:29:59,496
Just a little.

366
00:30:00,837 --> 00:30:02,567
I hope you find a little more happiness.

367
00:30:11,107 --> 00:30:12,147
Kill me.

368
00:30:20,516 --> 00:30:23,186
Don't stall. That's even more annoying!

369
00:30:26,087 --> 00:30:27,226
Open your eyes.

370
00:30:29,196 --> 00:30:30,567
Consider your request granted.

371
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,597
However,

372
00:30:33,936 --> 00:30:35,166
you're coming with me.

373
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:44,047
When the Imoogi in her calls for you,

374
00:30:44,847 --> 00:30:46,877
you will become my soldier.

375
00:30:57,226 --> 00:30:59,087
Stay in places like that for too long...

376
00:30:59,486 --> 00:31:01,426
and the darkness will swallow you whole.

377
00:31:24,837 --> 00:31:27,278
How may I help you?

378
00:31:27,508 --> 00:31:28,677
I'm here to turn myself in.

379
00:31:29,147 --> 00:31:30,218
Sorry?

380
00:31:30,617 --> 00:31:32,018
I'm here to turn myself in.

381
00:31:33,788 --> 00:31:35,218
I killed her.

382
00:31:35,488 --> 00:31:36,857
Killed whom?

383
00:31:37,018 --> 00:31:39,657
The mummified victim you found.

384
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:42,488
Are you for real?

385
00:31:42,887 --> 00:31:44,298
There are four more.

386
00:31:44,458 --> 00:31:46,697
Search my car's GPS history,

387
00:31:46,867 --> 00:31:50,167
and you'll find the burial sites for all victims.

388
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,697
- Check it out. - Sure.

389
00:31:54,107 --> 00:31:55,337
What's your motive?

390
00:31:55,437 --> 00:31:57,708
Why would the head of a broadcasting station...

391
00:31:58,508 --> 00:32:01,147
All I wanted was longevity.

392
00:32:03,248 --> 00:32:05,718
If you had been in my shoes,

393
00:32:06,248 --> 00:32:08,488
you would've made the same choice.

394
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:17,958
Want me to go in with you?

395
00:32:18,697 --> 00:32:19,798
No.

396
00:32:20,768 --> 00:32:24,397
I want to properly draw a picture of my parents' faces inside my head.

397
00:32:26,437 --> 00:32:30,008
- If anything happens to me... - That'll never happen.

398
00:32:33,677 --> 00:32:36,647
Still, go ahead, if that's how you feel.

399
00:32:39,048 --> 00:32:40,288
Don't worry though.

400
00:32:40,947 --> 00:32:44,058
It only surfaces when it senses danger.

401
00:32:46,318 --> 00:32:47,528
Or when it detects blood.

402
00:33:01,708 --> 00:33:03,068
Come to think of it...

403
00:33:08,677 --> 00:33:10,078
Long time no see, Yeon.

404
00:33:14,347 --> 00:33:16,147
The scales are slowly replacing my skin.

405
00:33:17,157 --> 00:33:19,318
It might not be long before...

406
00:33:20,288 --> 00:33:21,828
I lose myself completely.

407
00:33:42,947 --> 00:33:44,677
Well, I'm off to see the Snail Bride.

408
00:33:45,377 --> 00:33:47,587
Bring my part-timers over to my place later.

409
00:33:48,488 --> 00:33:49,958
Sae Rom and Jae Hwan?

410
00:33:58,379 --> 00:34:00,519
Yu Ri... Where's Yu Ri?

411
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:04,019
She left with that scary man.

412
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:06,689
She won't ever be back.

413
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:17,330
What did the fortune teller say? Did you look into it?

414
00:34:17,729 --> 00:34:20,339
I've been asking my contacts.

415
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,740
He didn't seem like some lowly spirit.

416
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,669
Who is this geezer?

417
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:27,080
Well,

418
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,049
this seems to be a groundless rumor,

419
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:34,049
but one of the Afterlife judges...

420
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,990
is said to leave his post once in a while.

421
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:44,530
That's interesting.

422
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:49,229
Anyway, let me know if you find out anything about him.

423
00:34:51,229 --> 00:34:53,439
- Here. - What is this?

424
00:34:53,439 --> 00:34:54,499
What is all this?

425
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:58,339
I was never able to buy you anything with the money I earned.

426
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:00,879
It's been eating away at me.

427
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:03,979
When did you find the time...

428
00:35:03,979 --> 00:35:06,249
out of your busy schedule to buy this?

429
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,879
Gosh, it's pretty.

430
00:35:09,049 --> 00:35:10,319
How nice.

431
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:12,450
Try it on.

432
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,919
I don't want to wear it out.

433
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,959
Our daughter bought this...

434
00:35:18,959 --> 00:35:20,459
with the money she worked hard to earn.

435
00:35:20,459 --> 00:35:22,100
Wearing it out is how we thank her.

436
00:35:22,799 --> 00:35:24,069
Go ahead and try it on.

437
00:35:24,899 --> 00:35:25,970
Should I?

438
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,330
This isn't the way home.

439
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,890
Give me five minutes.

440
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,399
Is it that good? Is it?

441
00:35:59,399 --> 00:36:00,499
Yu Ri!

442
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,740
What brings you by at this hour?

443
00:36:14,419 --> 00:36:15,680
That was unexpected.

444
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,850
It's my goodbye.

445
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,990
We're breaking up.

446
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:25,790
- What do you mean? - Shin Ju, you were just dumped.

447
00:36:26,189 --> 00:36:29,629
So don't wait for me any longer...

448
00:36:29,899 --> 00:36:31,030
and don't come looking for me.

449
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:33,100
Did I do something wrong?

450
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,240
No, I'm just tired of you.

451
00:36:34,999 --> 00:36:37,540
- I get bored easily, you see. - No.

452
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:40,209
That's not who you are.

453
00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:42,780
Though it takes a while,

454
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,680
you offer up your heart once the road to it opens.

455
00:36:45,109 --> 00:36:47,049
Though you act cold, you are the kindest of them all.

456
00:36:47,049 --> 00:36:49,220
- As if you know me well. - I do.

457
00:36:49,479 --> 00:36:52,749
- How you treat Rang and the dog... - Enough with Mr. Nice Guy.

458
00:36:53,249 --> 00:36:55,660
I hate how you patronize me...

459
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,290
about needing friends and family.

460
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:00,799
Your dowdy looks and that constant smile?

461
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,330
I hate them all.

462
00:37:08,069 --> 00:37:09,240
I won't patronize you.

463
00:37:09,939 --> 00:37:12,510
I'll buy and wear whatever you tell me to wear.

464
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,910
I won't smile if you don't want me to.

465
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:15,310
Will you please stop?

466
00:37:16,227 --> 00:37:18,457
I hate you, okay? I don't like you!

467
00:37:20,866 --> 00:37:21,926
You're lying.

468
00:37:27,737 --> 00:37:29,167
I don't want you clinging onto me either.

469
00:37:35,176 --> 00:37:36,246
I'll be off now.

470
00:37:39,516 --> 00:37:40,886
I can't break up with you.

471
00:37:41,417 --> 00:37:44,187
- Let me go. - No, I'll never let go.

472
00:37:45,317 --> 00:37:47,527
I won't let go until you take back what you just said.

473
00:37:50,963 --> 00:37:52,032
Shin Ju.

474
00:37:54,603 --> 00:37:56,673
You're making me get sick of you by acting like this.

475
00:38:00,472 --> 00:38:01,503
I'm sorry.

476
00:38:03,242 --> 00:38:06,713
I'm sorry for whatever it is that made you feel this way...

477
00:38:19,222 --> 00:38:20,222
Don't follow me.

478
00:38:29,262 --> 00:38:31,333
Will you please just disappear from my life?

479
00:38:52,393 --> 00:38:53,923
She told me I act too nice.

480
00:38:54,563 --> 00:38:58,393
She doesn't like how I look or the way I dress.

481
00:38:58,632 --> 00:39:01,563
I think I kind of understand what she means.

482
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:11,413
The ground cherry thief is a real brat.

483
00:39:12,512 --> 00:39:14,242
Why would she play with your heart like this?

484
00:39:14,512 --> 00:39:15,913
Don't speak ill of Yu Ri!

485
00:39:17,112 --> 00:39:18,182
Please.

486
00:39:20,552 --> 00:39:21,753
Stop crying.

487
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:24,253
She's my first and last love.

488
00:39:26,123 --> 00:39:27,722
I was even going to propose to her.

489
00:39:28,262 --> 00:39:30,632
Yesterday, I went to Jongno and bought her a gold ring.

490
00:39:31,862 --> 00:39:33,193
But I can't believe...

491
00:39:35,063 --> 00:39:37,333
There must be a reason why she suddenly broke up with you.

492
00:39:37,902 --> 00:39:39,402
I don't know why.

493
00:39:40,072 --> 00:39:42,543
It's Imoogi. Imoogi took her.

494
00:39:43,043 --> 00:39:44,472
Mr. Lee.

495
00:39:44,773 --> 00:39:45,813
Rang.

496
00:39:48,813 --> 00:39:50,552
What are you doing?

497
00:39:50,552 --> 00:39:52,682
You're awake. You're back.

498
00:39:53,112 --> 00:39:56,222
Stop acting so unusual. You're making me want to die again.

499
00:39:57,492 --> 00:39:59,893
- How did you wake up? - What do you mean by that?

500
00:40:00,063 --> 00:40:01,193
What do you mean Imoogi took her?

501
00:40:01,822 --> 00:40:04,632
He saved my life, and she went with him in return.

502
00:40:04,893 --> 00:40:05,992
Soo Ho saw them leave together.

503
00:40:06,492 --> 00:40:08,603
No, we need to find her.

504
00:40:09,902 --> 00:40:12,603
- Not like this. - What if he kills her?

505
00:40:12,833 --> 00:40:13,972
Let me go.

506
00:40:17,512 --> 00:40:20,413
Are you dumb or what? Are you trying to die with her?

507
00:40:21,512 --> 00:40:23,342
I figured you wouldn't be able to punch him, so I did it instead.

508
00:40:28,182 --> 00:40:29,682
I promise you this.

509
00:40:30,393 --> 00:40:32,452
I'll save your girlfriend and bring her back.

510
00:40:32,693 --> 00:40:34,262
I'll kill Imoogi.

511
00:40:34,623 --> 00:40:36,393
Leave that to me.

512
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:38,733
He tried to kill me twice.

513
00:40:41,032 --> 00:40:42,833
What about Soo Ho?

514
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:44,773
Is he home all by himself?

515
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:46,373
Yes, of course.

516
00:40:48,773 --> 00:40:50,543
You can't leave a kid home alone!

517
00:40:51,012 --> 00:40:52,873
He won't leave the house even if you try to drag him out.

518
00:41:15,103 --> 00:41:16,233
You're all here.

519
00:41:17,202 --> 00:41:19,132
Although, I can't say I'm glad to see everyone.

520
00:41:19,233 --> 00:41:20,643
Who are they?

521
00:41:22,043 --> 00:41:23,072
They're my part-timers.

522
00:41:32,713 --> 00:41:35,722
- What are you looking at? - You also look like a sculpture,

523
00:41:35,722 --> 00:41:37,023
so I can already tell.

524
00:41:37,293 --> 00:41:38,322
You're not human, are you?

525
00:41:38,322 --> 00:41:40,862
Don't talk to me or I'll bite you.

526
00:41:41,963 --> 00:41:43,023
No wonder.

527
00:41:43,163 --> 00:41:45,293
So there are 3 humans and 2 foxes.

528
00:41:45,592 --> 00:41:46,762
What are you, Dr. Koo?

529
00:41:47,702 --> 00:41:50,773
There are 3 humans and 3 foxes.

530
00:41:51,802 --> 00:41:54,802
Now that we're done introducing ourselves, let's begin.

531
00:41:54,972 --> 00:41:57,612
We're here to discuss our plan, so why are you here?

532
00:41:57,842 --> 00:41:59,913
Because I've dealt with Imoogi a lot more than you.

533
00:41:59,913 --> 00:42:01,413
And you also have one inside your body.

534
00:42:03,652 --> 00:42:06,882
Leave her out. What if he hears everything from inside her body?

535
00:42:06,882 --> 00:42:09,583
No, we need her for this.

536
00:42:10,652 --> 00:42:12,092
Whoever disagrees with that can leave.

537
00:42:14,063 --> 00:42:17,532
We've all encountered Imoogi at least once.

538
00:42:17,963 --> 00:42:20,402
And we almost got killed by him one way or another.

539
00:42:21,463 --> 00:42:22,762
He's even holding someone hostage.

540
00:42:25,432 --> 00:42:28,103
On top of that, he lives in two bodies, not one.

541
00:42:28,873 --> 00:42:30,842
We need to catch them both in order for this fight to end.

542
00:42:32,012 --> 00:42:33,143
And what's even worse...

543
00:42:36,543 --> 00:42:37,753
What's even worse is...

544
00:42:40,753 --> 00:42:42,123
that the main spirit lives inside my body.

545
00:42:48,893 --> 00:42:50,432
Hey, Imoogi's friend.

546
00:42:51,333 --> 00:42:54,932
Why don't you just kill yourself and make this easy for all of us?

547
00:42:55,663 --> 00:42:57,873
You should've just stayed in bed.

548
00:42:58,202 --> 00:43:00,373
Living as Sleeping Beauty suits you a lot better.

549
00:43:03,072 --> 00:43:06,213
We can't kill Imoogi by hurting him physically.

550
00:43:07,112 --> 00:43:08,583
He can even manipulate people's thoughts,

551
00:43:08,842 --> 00:43:11,713
and Ji A and I are the only ones who are free from his powers.

552
00:43:12,213 --> 00:43:14,882
It won't be easy, but try your best...

553
00:43:15,382 --> 00:43:16,583
not to face him one on one.

554
00:43:16,583 --> 00:43:19,753
But how can we fight him without encountering him?

555
00:43:20,362 --> 00:43:22,163
You won't be able to do much even if you do encounter him.

556
00:43:22,163 --> 00:43:24,492
You'd probably just call for help.

557
00:43:24,492 --> 00:43:26,333
- I'm warning you. - "I'm warning you."

558
00:43:26,862 --> 00:43:29,632
What does Terry eventually want by doing all this?

559
00:43:30,402 --> 00:43:33,373
He told me he's going to kill everyone.

560
00:43:34,873 --> 00:43:35,972
And then...

561
00:43:36,103 --> 00:43:38,143
Soon after, a virus will spread.

562
00:43:38,873 --> 00:43:42,083
No one will ever be happy again.

563
00:43:42,643 --> 00:43:43,853
"A virus"?

564
00:43:49,983 --> 00:43:51,753
Will you stop playing games?

565
00:43:52,023 --> 00:43:55,423
I'm listening. Just get to the point.

566
00:43:58,932 --> 00:44:01,333
Up until now, I was worried Ji A might get hurt.

567
00:44:01,463 --> 00:44:03,673
So I kept trying to fight the Imoogi we all know.

568
00:44:04,273 --> 00:44:05,572
But now,

569
00:44:07,342 --> 00:44:08,643
we're going to change our target.

570
00:44:08,902 --> 00:44:10,873
How are you going to kill what's inside her body?

571
00:44:11,673 --> 00:44:13,882
You've found a way, right?

572
00:44:15,543 --> 00:44:16,612
Yes, I have.

573
00:44:22,523 --> 00:44:24,992
(Traditional Korean Cuisine: The Snail Bride)

574
00:44:24,992 --> 00:44:31,432
(Traditional Korean Cuisine: The Snail Bride)

575
00:44:33,532 --> 00:44:35,733
Do you remember the fortune teller we met at the Korean Folk Village?

576
00:44:36,333 --> 00:44:37,532
Yes, of course.

577
00:44:38,103 --> 00:44:40,072
Thanks to someone, I lost my fox bead.

578
00:44:40,443 --> 00:44:42,972
I heard he's actually pretty powerful. Is that true?

579
00:44:43,342 --> 00:44:44,773
He's one of the afterlife judges.

580
00:44:46,572 --> 00:44:48,583
- What? - He even has...

581
00:44:48,583 --> 00:44:49,882
the Sin Slayer.

582
00:44:51,952 --> 00:44:53,012
No way.

583
00:44:53,682 --> 00:44:54,753
What's a Sin Slayer?

584
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,652
It's a dagger that slays sins.

585
00:44:56,882 --> 00:44:58,623
It slays sins?

586
00:44:58,952 --> 00:45:02,092
I heard King Hades made it himself a long time ago with the branch...

587
00:45:02,092 --> 00:45:03,623
of the tree that weighs our sins.

588
00:45:03,932 --> 00:45:06,432
But didn't it disappear thousands of years ago?

589
00:45:07,463 --> 00:45:09,503
Snail Bride just picked it up.

590
00:45:10,233 --> 00:45:13,972
But wouldn't that dagger hurt Director Nam?

591
00:45:14,043 --> 00:45:15,072
No, she won't get hurt.

592
00:45:15,643 --> 00:45:17,313
The Sin Slayer is a wooden dagger.

593
00:45:18,213 --> 00:45:20,112
It slays things that cannot be slain.

594
00:45:20,213 --> 00:45:23,583
In other words, it'll only slay Imoogi's spirit.

595
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:25,552
Thank goodness, Ji A.

596
00:45:30,623 --> 00:45:31,652
When are we going to do this?

597
00:45:36,393 --> 00:45:37,463
Tomorrow.

598
00:46:01,123 --> 00:46:02,452
How does it feel to be born again?

599
00:46:04,452 --> 00:46:06,193
I don't know if it's because I came back from the dead,

600
00:46:06,193 --> 00:46:07,893
but this coffee tastes amazing.

601
00:46:08,793 --> 00:46:10,123
You should live a long life.

602
00:46:10,663 --> 00:46:13,362
If you die early, you won't be able to drink coffee anymore.

603
00:46:13,362 --> 00:46:14,463
It'd be no fun.

604
00:46:14,463 --> 00:46:16,202
Were you scared I might die?

605
00:46:16,802 --> 00:46:18,833
Yes, I was scared.

606
00:46:22,072 --> 00:46:23,543
What's yours? Let me have a sip.

607
00:46:25,313 --> 00:46:26,373
It's good.

608
00:46:29,242 --> 00:46:30,483
Why are you so nice to me?

609
00:46:31,012 --> 00:46:33,552
We've never really been to a cafe like this together.

610
00:46:34,882 --> 00:46:37,353
All I needed to do was just reach out.

611
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:39,722
I don't get why I never thought of doing that.

612
00:46:40,693 --> 00:46:42,992
What's with you? You're acting like you're about to die soon.

613
00:46:50,733 --> 00:46:52,003
It's really delicious.

614
00:46:52,003 --> 00:46:54,802
It is, isn't it? Let me try a sip of yours too.

615
00:46:55,072 --> 00:46:57,873
- No, you can't have mine. - You ungrateful punk.

616
00:46:58,465 --> 00:46:59,666
Hey, don't drink mine.

617
00:47:11,853 --> 00:47:12,952
What happened?

618
00:47:13,492 --> 00:47:14,663
Nothing.

619
00:47:14,862 --> 00:47:15,963
Was it her?

620
00:47:16,693 --> 00:47:17,862
It wasn't like that.

621
00:47:17,862 --> 00:47:19,233
You're defending her, so I guess I'm right.

622
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:28,961
Will that sin-slaying dagger really work on Imoogi?

623
00:47:29,191 --> 00:47:30,961
It has been over 600 years.

624
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,830
I plan to end this fight once and for all.

625
00:47:35,531 --> 00:47:36,901
What if you fail?

626
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:42,540
What happens to me then?

627
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,310
Rang.

628
00:47:47,881 --> 00:47:50,410
That's why I need you.

629
00:47:57,890 --> 00:48:00,160
I worked so hard all my life.

630
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:04,131
I was so close to becoming the most powerful man in the nation.

631
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:05,200
Darn it.

632
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,731
But I'm stuck in this tiny cell.

633
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,540
At least I'm alive.

634
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:15,870
I'm alive.

635
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,111
(Two Meals)

636
00:48:51,111 --> 00:48:52,180
This too.

637
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:54,611
How could you want tteokbokki right now?

638
00:48:54,751 --> 00:48:57,881
Even if the world ends tomorrow, I'd want tteokbokki.

639
00:48:57,881 --> 00:48:59,620
Give me that. Fill that up.

640
00:48:59,751 --> 00:49:01,450
- You want a cheese ball, right? - Yes.

641
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:04,120
- One cheeseball, please. - Okay.

642
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,001
This is so good.

643
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,231
- This is really good. - This?

644
00:49:15,901 --> 00:49:18,441
How does this taste good even in the midst of everything?

645
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,740
Right?

646
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:28,910
Don't come to me for the time being.

647
00:49:29,211 --> 00:49:31,450
Your lives may be in danger if you're with me.

648
00:49:32,151 --> 00:49:33,220
That's up to me.

649
00:49:33,751 --> 00:49:35,490
You guys almost died.

650
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:40,830
Do you remember...

651
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:43,761
when my mom came to Seoul to get back surgery?

652
00:49:44,031 --> 00:49:47,671
She cried because she couldn't go to the hospital because of her show.

653
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:49,531
You went to the hospital in my place.

654
00:49:50,031 --> 00:49:51,571
You were there for my mom.

655
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:54,071
If she were all alone that day,

656
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,011
I would've blamed myself forever after she died.

657
00:49:57,881 --> 00:50:00,441
- Let us help too. - She's right.

658
00:50:00,751 --> 00:50:03,381
We're ordinary humans, so we're powerless,

659
00:50:03,381 --> 00:50:07,080
but I want to do anything I can if it will save your life.

660
00:50:11,761 --> 00:50:14,990
Right now, going back to work...

661
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:16,591
is how you can help me.

662
00:50:17,631 --> 00:50:20,631
Mr. Choi will throw a hissy fit if all three of us are out.

663
00:50:20,731 --> 00:50:21,901
He isn't in.

664
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:24,200
What?

665
00:50:25,171 --> 00:50:26,270
He turned himself in?

666
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:30,611
Imoogi wouldn't just let him live like that.

667
00:50:33,511 --> 00:50:36,450
Find out what's happening at the police station.

668
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:37,720
Okay.

669
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,790
The person you have reached...

670
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,660
Mr. Choi isn't answering his phone.

671
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:56,770
- Call an ambulance! - Okay.

672
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,901
This is Geumran Police Station.

673
00:51:00,001 --> 00:51:03,040
- We need... - Let... Let me. I'll help.

674
00:51:03,711 --> 00:51:05,341
- Please hold his head up. - Okay.

675
00:51:23,731 --> 00:51:26,700
Snail Bride, we have to pull up our plan.

676
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:41,211
(Traditional Korean Cuisine: The Snail Bride)

677
00:52:03,071 --> 00:52:07,301
(Traditional Korean Cuisine: The Snail Bride)

678
00:52:16,781 --> 00:52:20,680
(Traditional Korean Cuisine: The Snail Bride)

679
00:52:24,921 --> 00:52:26,591
He's making his move.

680
00:52:26,821 --> 00:52:28,430
We don't have much time.

681
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:33,430
We'll catch the Imoogi in Ji A's body today.

682
00:52:37,171 --> 00:52:39,600
Everything must go exactly as planned.

683
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,470
We get it, so say it.

684
00:52:42,671 --> 00:52:43,970
It's simple.

685
00:52:44,211 --> 00:52:45,941
Ji A will draw her blood...

686
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,410
and lure Imoogi out.

687
00:52:48,251 --> 00:52:51,421
Once he comes out, I'll stab him with the Sin Slayer.

688
00:52:52,381 --> 00:52:55,091
Shin Ju. Once Ji A and I go in,

689
00:52:55,091 --> 00:52:56,390
lock the door from the outside.

690
00:52:57,020 --> 00:53:00,321
No one can come near us until I give the signal.

691
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:03,990
Why not?

692
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:06,231
By chance if he escapes from Ji A,

693
00:53:08,131 --> 00:53:09,430
you guys will be in danger.

694
00:53:10,571 --> 00:53:12,270
He may enter one of your bodies.

695
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,910
That's why I made a border with horse blood.

696
00:53:15,011 --> 00:53:17,711
He's different from the Imoogi we've known until now.

697
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:21,381
We don't know what he looks like or how and where he'd move.

698
00:53:21,881 --> 00:53:23,580
We don't know anything right now.

699
00:53:24,011 --> 00:53:26,020
We cannot make a single mistake.

700
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:28,921
What if he goes into you?

701
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:32,290
That won't happen as long as I'm conscious.

702
00:53:34,531 --> 00:53:35,631
Shin Ju.

703
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:41,071
It's a snake. I got one that is a perfect fit for him.

704
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:47,200
So, the best is if you can slay it in one go.

705
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,810
Even if he gets away,

706
00:53:49,671 --> 00:53:52,180
that snake is the only body he can go into.

707
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:57,921
Let's go. I want to get rid of it as soon as possible.

708
00:54:46,231 --> 00:54:47,301
Here's the dagger.

709
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:54,200
Thank you. You should go.

710
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:57,841
Please be careful.

711
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:42,850
Okay, then.

712
00:55:44,251 --> 00:55:45,691
Shall we begin?

713
00:55:46,191 --> 00:55:47,321
But first,

714
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:51,461
tie me to the chair with this.

715
00:55:52,861 --> 00:55:55,071
What if I hurt you again?

716
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:56,600
That's unncessary.

717
00:55:56,930 --> 00:55:59,540
Do as I say. Okay?

718
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:07,611
Why do you keep trying to protect me?

719
00:56:23,361 --> 00:56:25,330
I have a bad feeling about this.

720
00:56:25,901 --> 00:56:27,660
Don't say that. You'll jinx it.

721
00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:50,290
Okay, then. I'll tie you up.

722
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:54,220
Okay. Yeon.

723
00:56:56,131 --> 00:56:57,761
Will you give me a hug?

724
00:57:07,198 --> 00:57:10,137
Don't hesitate because of me, okay?

725
00:57:11,178 --> 00:57:12,408
There's nothing to be nervous about.

726
00:57:13,077 --> 00:57:14,847
It's only a blunt wooden dagger.

727
00:57:15,278 --> 00:57:17,917
I'm prepared for any unwanted injuries.

728
00:57:18,417 --> 00:57:19,878
As if I'd let you get hurt.

729
00:57:20,318 --> 00:57:22,948
Besides, this dagger can only slay the unslayable,

730
00:57:22,948 --> 00:57:24,917
like Imoogi's soul.

731
00:57:26,687 --> 00:57:29,887
Does that mean, it can also slay...

732
00:57:30,528 --> 00:57:31,557
your soul too?

733
00:57:41,028 --> 00:57:43,869
Don't hesitate because of me, okay?

734
00:57:44,908 --> 00:57:46,369
There's nothing to be nervous about.

735
00:57:46,738 --> 00:57:48,539
It's only a blunt wooden dagger.

736
00:57:48,939 --> 00:57:51,579
I'm prepared for any unwanted injuries.

737
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:53,548
As if I'd let you get hurt.

738
00:57:53,979 --> 00:57:56,619
Besides, this dagger can only slay the unslayable,

739
00:57:56,619 --> 00:57:58,649
like Imoogi's soul.

740
00:58:00,388 --> 00:58:03,459
Does that mean, it can also slay...

741
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:05,289
your soul too?

742
00:58:07,258 --> 00:58:09,229
Of course, it can.

743
00:58:18,809 --> 00:58:21,508
- But... - Yes?

744
00:58:23,508 --> 00:58:24,908
I've been meaning to ask.

745
00:58:27,479 --> 00:58:28,479
Who are you?

746
00:58:31,289 --> 00:58:32,388
What's dying...

747
00:58:33,189 --> 00:58:34,318
is your soul.

748
00:58:44,968 --> 00:58:46,169
- You can't. - Move.

749
00:58:46,329 --> 00:58:48,899
I'll kill her if anything happens to Yeon.

750
00:58:48,939 --> 00:58:51,738
Do so, but only over my dead body.

751
00:58:52,568 --> 00:58:53,908
You think that can stop me?

752
00:59:01,678 --> 00:59:02,818
How pathetic.

753
00:59:04,849 --> 00:59:07,588
Who knew you'd actually come in possession of the Sin Slayer?

754
00:59:12,129 --> 00:59:14,459
Hey. Are you pretending to be asleep?

755
00:59:26,769 --> 00:59:27,769
Wait.

756
00:59:29,108 --> 00:59:30,709
Did that really kill his soul?

757
01:00:28,669 --> 01:00:30,638
This was inevitable anyway.

758
01:00:38,278 --> 01:00:41,818
So how about it? An old home for a new one.

759
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:56,298
Don't you know how pricey houses are these days?

760
01:00:56,298 --> 01:00:58,028
You little thief.

761
01:00:58,269 --> 01:00:59,928
- What on earth? - Isn't it obvious?

762
01:01:01,229 --> 01:01:02,638
This is what I needed to confirm.

763
01:01:04,669 --> 01:01:07,269
So this is how you jump from body to body.

764
01:01:11,579 --> 01:01:14,309
The fortune teller has been untraceable since the folk village.

765
01:01:14,678 --> 01:01:17,919
Even the Gatekeeper of Samdo River hasn't been able to spot him.

766
01:01:18,588 --> 01:01:19,818
Darn it.

767
01:01:20,488 --> 01:01:21,519
What now?

768
01:01:22,459 --> 01:01:26,028
Go out and find me a random wooden dagger.

769
01:01:26,229 --> 01:01:27,289
A wooden dagger?

770
01:01:27,629 --> 01:01:29,829
What use do you have for a blunt dagger?

771
01:01:30,599 --> 01:01:32,528
To slay the unslayable.

772
01:01:39,939 --> 01:01:42,709
How about we change the game a bit?

773
01:01:49,278 --> 01:01:50,349
Stop the car.

774
01:01:58,229 --> 01:02:00,888
So this dagger was never...

775
01:02:01,329 --> 01:02:03,629
It cost 10 dollars at a flea market.

776
01:02:04,459 --> 01:02:06,869
The fortune teller only pops up...

777
01:02:06,869 --> 01:02:08,968
wherever it wants to whenever it wants to.

778
01:02:09,298 --> 01:02:11,338
Darn rat.

779
01:02:11,338 --> 01:02:13,068
Right back at you.

780
01:02:13,209 --> 01:02:14,879
What was with the silly Ji A act?

781
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:16,178
Did you know it was me?

782
01:02:16,178 --> 01:02:19,579
I could smell the metallic scent of blood.

783
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:21,778
As you know, I have a heightened sense of smell.

784
01:02:22,579 --> 01:02:24,789
Anyway, I thank you for the donation.

785
01:02:26,818 --> 01:02:28,689
Knowing my secret...

786
01:02:28,689 --> 01:02:30,559
doesn't automatically give you the upper hand.

787
01:02:30,988 --> 01:02:34,798
Even if you bury it elsewhere, I'll still find a way back to her.

788
01:02:35,358 --> 01:02:38,329
I will keep doing so until you hand over your body.

789
01:02:38,729 --> 01:02:42,698
So what you're saying is that I can plant your soul elsewhere...

790
01:02:43,238 --> 01:02:44,298
by burying this.

791
01:02:46,769 --> 01:02:50,138
For instance... How about that rat snake?

792
01:02:52,508 --> 01:02:53,649
I dare you to try.

793
01:02:57,948 --> 01:02:59,149
Don't tell me...

794
01:03:00,448 --> 01:03:02,419
you're expecting me...

795
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:05,289
to be gently dragged out of this body.

796
01:03:24,379 --> 01:03:26,849
Right. If I'm being honest,

797
01:03:26,849 --> 01:03:29,579
I like this piece of Imoogi better than the other one.

798
01:03:29,979 --> 01:03:32,619
A villain should at least be this crazy.

799
01:03:32,789 --> 01:03:34,919
Romance, my foot.

800
01:03:36,218 --> 01:03:39,888
This woman is and will always be my hostage.

801
01:03:39,888 --> 01:03:42,229
The other piece of Imoogi is more interested in Ji A...

802
01:03:42,229 --> 01:03:43,858
than being united with you.

803
01:03:44,059 --> 01:03:46,798
He is nothing but a bunch of fragments.

804
01:03:46,798 --> 01:03:48,568
Not according to him though.

805
01:03:48,769 --> 01:03:51,939
You think you can pit us against each other?

806
01:03:52,809 --> 01:03:53,908
Dream on.

807
01:03:56,678 --> 01:04:00,149
Do you even know what he's up to right now?

808
01:04:02,548 --> 01:04:05,988
You see, he's...

809
01:04:23,399 --> 01:04:25,908
Irritating imbeciles.

810
01:04:51,535 --> 01:04:54,975
(Name: Nam Ji A, Date of Birth: March 3, 1991)

811
01:04:54,975 --> 01:04:58,015
(Date of Death:)

812
01:05:00,414 --> 01:05:02,484
(Date of Death: Today)

813
01:05:17,294 --> 01:05:19,205
Innocent lives are being sacrificed.

814
01:05:19,905 --> 01:05:22,774
It won't be long before chaos sweeps the world.

815
01:05:22,834 --> 01:05:24,834
No, you're wrong.

816
01:05:26,044 --> 01:05:29,714
All along, you're the one who's been chaos itself.

817
01:05:30,144 --> 01:05:32,214
- Honey. - Don't call me that.

818
01:05:32,914 --> 01:05:34,214
For I...

819
01:05:35,354 --> 01:05:37,184
just decided to give up that title.

820
01:05:37,455 --> 01:05:39,955
Don't be ridiculous. On whose authority?

821
01:05:44,124 --> 01:05:45,265
Stop right there.

822
01:05:45,964 --> 01:05:47,195
You heard me!

823
01:05:47,394 --> 01:05:48,834
The moment you step past those doors,

824
01:05:48,834 --> 01:05:50,265
you'll lose everything.

825
01:05:50,265 --> 01:05:51,805
I'll make sure of it!

826
01:06:24,894 --> 01:06:26,365
Are you okay?

827
01:06:41,854 --> 01:06:42,914
Yeon.

828
01:06:44,385 --> 01:06:46,325
Yes, it's me.

829
01:06:49,495 --> 01:06:50,555
Let's hurry.

830
01:06:51,225 --> 01:06:53,064
At least so I can be myself...

831
01:06:54,195 --> 01:06:56,095
right before it all ends.

832
01:07:00,164 --> 01:07:03,434
I want to be there beside you.

833
01:07:11,514 --> 01:07:12,644
Let's end this.

834
01:07:14,285 --> 01:07:16,054
Let's put an end...

835
01:07:17,655 --> 01:07:18,724
to this exhausting fight.

836
01:07:21,455 --> 01:07:24,755
(The List)

837
01:07:24,755 --> 01:07:26,224
(Name: Nam Ji A, Date of Birth: March 3, 1991)

838
01:07:26,224 --> 01:07:27,665
(Date of Death: Today)

839
01:07:27,665 --> 01:07:30,495
(Name: Nam Ji A)

840
01:07:30,495 --> 01:07:37,405
(Date of Death: Today)

841
01:08:00,564 --> 01:08:03,695
(Tale of The Nine Tailed)

842
01:08:04,295 --> 01:08:05,665
Just give me three more days.

843
01:08:05,665 --> 01:08:07,934
I can catch him! I can catch Imoogi!

844
01:08:08,165 --> 01:08:09,304
It's too late.

845
01:08:09,304 --> 01:08:10,604
You'll regret this.

846
01:08:10,905 --> 01:08:13,505
If it weren't for me, Yeon would still be...

847
01:08:13,974 --> 01:08:17,514
living as a mountain spirit.

848
01:08:17,974 --> 01:08:19,684
Yeon will never forgive me for this.

849
01:08:20,115 --> 01:08:22,384
Don't make me regret liking you, Yu Ri.

850
01:08:22,384 --> 01:08:25,484
I have the power to destroy everything you care for.

851
01:08:27,024 --> 01:08:29,894
Let's join hands and kill the gatekeeper of Samdo River.

852
01:08:30,325 --> 01:08:31,394
And what's the condition?

853
01:08:31,755 --> 01:08:32,924
Give me Ji A.
