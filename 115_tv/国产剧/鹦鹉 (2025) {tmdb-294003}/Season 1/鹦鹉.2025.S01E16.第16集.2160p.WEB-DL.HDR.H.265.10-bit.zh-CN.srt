00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,970
From the moment you open an image to process  through Capture One or through Camera Raw,

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,990
you begin the process of setting  up your image for retouching.

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,710
In this chapter, we will go  over how I set up an image.

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:16,200
Setting up an image correctly is crucial in  setting the tone of the image and its workability

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,990
as you go through rounds of  revisions with your client.

6
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:24,000
These are the steps I take for introducing  images to the world of high fashion and its

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,550
partner scrutiny.

8
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,890
As you can see here I have  this image in 16-bit depth.

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,730
I process in 16-bit depth, because it gives  us a much better starting point as opposed

10
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,690
to just starting an 8-bit.

11
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:40,280
Although Photoshop is much more workable in  8-bit, and we will be converting to 8-bit,

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,190
the transitions between pixels are much  smoother when you give yourself this starting point.

13
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:50,320
I also make a couple moves in 16-bit that  help preserve the integrity of the pixels

14
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,100
such as unsharp mask, which  I'm going to do right now.

15
00:00:54,100 --> 00:01:00,710
So Filter, I go down to Sharpen and I go right  to Unsharp Mask, and I start with this formula

16
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:07,070
right here with the Amount of 100, the Radius  at 1, Threshold at 0, and we'll zoom in right

17
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:11,350
here, and I'm just going to turn the preview  on and off so you could see the bit of a

18
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:16,860
pop that it gives it; just a little bit  of a crunch and I use this formula--this was

19
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,500
handed to me from another retoucher, as I  was learning how to retouch, and I have used

20
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,990
it as the base of my sharpening ever since.

21
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,020
This particular kind of sharpening gives it  a little bit of grit that's very similar to

22
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:33,930
what you'd feel on an actual  prints and not a digital file.

23
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:40,090
So I like the way this feels, so we're going  to hit OK and zoom on out, and now we're going

24
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:46,200
to check the image size and I'm at a 20  height, a 300 resolution, and that's good.

25
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,590
If you do need to change the image size  interpolating in 16-bit also gives you the advantage of

26
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,670
preserving the integrity of the  pixels without damaging it too much.

27
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,990
So we're at a good point right now, so I'm  going to now convert it to 8-bit which is

28
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,810
through Image > Mode > 8 Bit.

29
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:09,780
For my own workflow I have my quick key setup  for Shift+Command+L which just automatically

30
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,000
puts it to 8-bit.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,820
So we have our image now in 8-bit,  and we are ready to start working.

32
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:20,820
So in our next movie we will be  setting up our color and contrast.

33
01:59:58,000 --> 01:59:59:000
