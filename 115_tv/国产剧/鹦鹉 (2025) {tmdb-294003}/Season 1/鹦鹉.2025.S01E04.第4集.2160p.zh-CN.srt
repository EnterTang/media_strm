1
00:00:02,222 --> 00:00:04,099
- Do it, try it.
- No. What, right now?

2
00:00:04,308 --> 00:00:06,143
- Right here.
- All right, all right.

3
00:00:07,394 --> 00:00:09,855
Kind of. Kind of that.
Gotta work on it, bro.

4
00:00:10,063 --> 00:00:11,440
- All right, man.
- Seriously.

5
00:00:11,648 --> 00:00:15,736
All right, bro, I'll work on it.
But just tell me, when do you--?

6
00:00:15,944 --> 00:00:18,655
Right before the cork pops.
Timing's important, but--

7
00:00:18,864 --> 00:00:20,824
But you don't do it, like, in her ear?

8
00:00:21,033 --> 00:00:24,786
No, you don't do it in her ear.
It's a given you don't do it in her ear.

9
00:00:24,995 --> 00:00:27,414
- This is, like, scientifically proven.
- Really?

10
00:00:27,623 --> 00:00:30,167
- Prehistoric stuff. It's like the medulla.
- Crazy.

11
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:31,502
- The wolf brain.
- What?

12
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,630
- It's primitive stuff.
- Okay, let me try it again.

13
00:00:35,714 --> 00:00:37,466
Yeah!

14
00:00:37,883 --> 00:00:40,260
- Yeah? That's the wolf brain!
- Nice.

15
00:00:41,887 --> 00:00:44,556
Man, this town sucks.

16
00:00:44,765 --> 00:00:48,393
Sorry, bro, I know it's yours
and everything, but it's not even 2.

17
00:00:48,602 --> 00:00:51,146
Yeah, it does kind of suck.

18
00:00:51,355 --> 00:00:55,859
Hey, I know this after-hours place over--
A couple blocks off Cermak.

19
00:00:56,068 --> 00:00:59,821
- You wanna hit it? Fucking hit it.
- Hells, yeah. Let's do it.

20
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:04,701
That's what I'm talking about.

21
00:01:09,665 --> 00:01:11,083
Okay.

22
00:01:13,835 --> 00:01:16,255
- Not in her ear, right?
- Right, not in her ear.

23
00:01:16,463 --> 00:01:18,882
Hey, bro, I never did catch your name.

24
00:01:19,091 --> 00:01:21,802
- Saul.
- Saul?

25
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,096
"S'all good, man."

26
00:01:24,304 --> 00:01:27,724
- Get it?
- I do. All right, Saul.

27
00:01:28,559 --> 00:01:30,227
Hey, hey, brother, whoa.

28
00:01:30,435 --> 00:01:32,938
Check it out. What is that?

29
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,109
Holy shit.

30
00:01:37,651 --> 00:01:39,987
There's gotta be at least
a thousand bucks in here.

31
00:01:40,195 --> 00:01:42,155
Oh, my God, look at that.

32
00:01:42,364 --> 00:01:44,157
- Whose is it?
- Mine.

33
00:01:44,366 --> 00:01:48,745
Hey, possession's like four-tenths
of the what-do-you-call-it, bro.

34
00:01:48,954 --> 00:01:51,331
- Like, is there an ID or...?
- Yeah.

35
00:01:53,667 --> 00:01:55,711
I don't know, some fat guy.

36
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,927
I'm thinking that one.

37
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,599
Let's see.

38
00:02:21,194 --> 00:02:22,529
Jesus.

39
00:02:22,738 --> 00:02:24,031
Is he--?

40
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,907
- What?
- Is he...?

41
00:02:26,116 --> 00:02:27,701
I don't know.

42
00:02:44,468 --> 00:02:47,346
Hey. Hey, fella. You all right?

43
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:56,229
Hey, buddy.

44
00:02:56,647 --> 00:02:57,814
Hey, would you answer me?

45
00:02:58,273 --> 00:03:00,400
Hey, answer this, you butthole.

46
00:03:01,818 --> 00:03:04,446
- "Butthole"? What the hell?
- Hey.

47
00:03:04,655 --> 00:03:06,156
Hey, bro, be nice, all right?

48
00:03:06,365 --> 00:03:08,867
This guy right here,
he's trying to help you.

49
00:03:09,076 --> 00:03:12,120
Help yourself to some of this,
you butthole.

50
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:14,081
- Hey.
- Hey, we're not buttholes.

51
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:16,208
- All right? So stop saying that.
- Yeah.

52
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:19,461
<i>Butt, butt, butthole</i>

53
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,172
Hey, man, what's your problem?

54
00:03:22,381 --> 00:03:25,842
My problem is I'm standing here
talking to a couple buttholes.

55
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:27,969
You're not standing, you fat bastard.

56
00:03:28,178 --> 00:03:29,888
You're laying on your fat ass.

57
00:03:30,097 --> 00:03:33,767
Hey, I'll roundhouse-kick you
right in your heads. You think I won't?

58
00:03:33,975 --> 00:03:36,144
I'll come into the McDonald's
where you work...

59
00:03:36,353 --> 00:03:39,648
...I'll buy the whole damn place
and I'll fire you.

60
00:03:39,856 --> 00:03:44,361
I'll say, "Drop your mops,
you buttholes, because you're fired."

61
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:50,075
And then I'll roundhouse-kick you
right in your stupid heads.

62
00:03:50,283 --> 00:03:55,872
And then I'll go
Jean-Claude Van Damme on you, you....

63
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,418
Butthole.

64
00:04:02,003 --> 00:04:03,964
I'm keeping the money.

65
00:04:04,589 --> 00:04:05,841
Here you go, fatty.

66
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:08,927
I got dibs on that watch, man.

67
00:04:10,637 --> 00:04:12,347
I didn't see that.

68
00:04:15,726 --> 00:04:17,602
What kind is it?

69
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,898
I don't know, it's just a watch.

70
00:04:22,107 --> 00:04:23,692
We gotta get out of here, man.

71
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,569
What kind of watch is it?

72
00:04:25,777 --> 00:04:30,365
- It's-- I don't know, it's--
- Well, then let me look at it.

73
00:04:32,033 --> 00:04:34,619
- It's a damn Rolex.
- I don't know.

74
00:04:34,828 --> 00:04:37,164
Not cool to be greedy, bro. Not cool.

75
00:04:37,372 --> 00:04:40,083
I didn't know what--

76
00:04:40,292 --> 00:04:44,212
So how do you wanna split this up?
Tell you what. You keep the cash.

77
00:04:44,421 --> 00:04:46,590
- I'll just keep the watch.
- It's worth 3 grand.

78
00:04:46,798 --> 00:04:48,341
- What?
- Three thousand, easy.

79
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,635
- No.
- Yeah.

80
00:04:50,844 --> 00:04:52,929
Hey, hey, hey. Come on, now.

81
00:04:53,138 --> 00:04:54,514
Let's figure this out.
Gotta get out of here.

82
00:04:54,723 --> 00:04:56,725
All right, you're right. You know what?

83
00:04:56,933 --> 00:04:59,102
I will sweeten the pot.

84
00:04:59,311 --> 00:05:02,898
You got 5, 20, 40, 60, 80--
Five hundred and eighty bucks.

85
00:05:03,106 --> 00:05:05,442
Add that to the thousand,
it's more than half.

86
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,737
What do you know about that thing?
Is it worth more than 3?

87
00:05:08,945 --> 00:05:11,114
No, I don't know, but we're good, right?

88
00:05:11,323 --> 00:05:13,283
Yeah, we good? Okay?

89
00:05:13,492 --> 00:05:14,993
Well....

90
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:19,456
Later, sucker!

91
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,060
Six left.

92
00:05:40,268 --> 00:05:42,521
- Can we get more?
- God, I hope so.

93
00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:46,316
It's like a licence to print money.
Thing of beauty.

94
00:05:46,525 --> 00:05:49,861
Hey, what was that crazy stuff
about roundhouse kicks?

95
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,030
- Where did you get that?
- I don't know.

96
00:05:52,239 --> 00:05:55,033
Just something in my brain, you know?
It just came out.

97
00:05:55,242 --> 00:05:57,369
- Too much?
- No, I loved it.

98
00:05:57,577 --> 00:06:01,998
It was, like, deep or something.

99
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:05,210
Wanna talk about brilliant, I mean....

100
00:06:05,418 --> 00:06:07,462
You're the man. Me, I'm just....

101
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:10,215
I love watching you work.

102
00:06:12,676 --> 00:06:16,513
It's good for making beer money.
That's about all.

103
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,457
Please, no one has to know.

104
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,918
You could just pretend
you didn't find us.

105
00:06:47,127 --> 00:06:49,379
We would never tell anyone,
would we, Craig?

106
00:06:49,588 --> 00:06:50,797
- No, absolutely not.
- No.

107
00:06:51,006 --> 00:06:53,133
I already called your lawyer.

108
00:06:53,425 --> 00:06:58,346
Besides, this little family outing of yours
has put an innocent man in jail.

109
00:06:58,763 --> 00:07:00,807
Cops are investigating this
as a kidnapping.

110
00:07:01,016 --> 00:07:04,477
They already rounded up
some poor suspect.

111
00:07:05,145 --> 00:07:06,897
A working-class guy.

112
00:07:07,105 --> 00:07:09,024
A father, I think.

113
00:07:09,232 --> 00:07:12,944
But anyway, you two,
you almost ruined someone's life.

114
00:07:13,153 --> 00:07:15,155
Potentially several someones.

115
00:07:15,363 --> 00:07:16,615
We had no idea.

116
00:07:16,823 --> 00:07:19,659
Could this have been
the person in the van?

117
00:07:20,493 --> 00:07:23,788
What if the man they arrested
is the one we were warned about?

118
00:07:23,997 --> 00:07:26,583
Yeah, maybe he's not so innocent.

119
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,543
Warned? Warned how?

120
00:07:28,752 --> 00:07:32,213
We had a phone call.
Someone disguising their voice.

121
00:07:32,422 --> 00:07:34,007
They said someone was coming for us.

122
00:07:34,215 --> 00:07:36,176
And there was a van outside the house...

123
00:07:36,384 --> 00:07:39,012
...as if whoever was inside
was watching us.

124
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:43,600
And once that drove off,
we did what we did.

125
00:07:43,808 --> 00:07:45,018
- For the kids.
- The kids.

126
00:07:45,226 --> 00:07:48,605
I wouldn't know about
any of that, I just....

127
00:07:48,813 --> 00:07:51,942
I can assure you that
you and your family are safe.

128
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:55,278
- The police are all over this thing, so--
- It doesn't matter.

129
00:07:55,487 --> 00:07:57,822
We can't just go back.

130
00:07:58,031 --> 00:08:00,659
Our case. They'll crucify Craig.

131
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:06,122
Can't you just call Ms. Wexler again?
Tell her you didn't see us after all.

132
00:08:06,331 --> 00:08:10,126
If they think I ran away,
it'll look like I did something wrong.

133
00:08:10,335 --> 00:08:12,337
Yeah,
and we can't risk losing everything...

134
00:08:12,545 --> 00:08:14,464
...just because of some teensy mistake.

135
00:08:14,673 --> 00:08:16,007
Can I ask you something?

136
00:08:16,216 --> 00:08:18,301
What were you hoping would happen?

137
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:21,388
I mean, before I found you,
what were you planning to do?

138
00:08:21,596 --> 00:08:24,140
Well, we were in the process
of, you know...

139
00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:27,894
- ...working that out, when you....
- We were working that out, yeah.

140
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:32,774
All right, well, you've still got
a little bit of manoeuverability, all right?

141
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:36,027
You're outdoorsy, right? So you
went on an impromptu camping trip.

142
00:08:36,236 --> 00:08:39,531
I don't know, it's something
people do, apparently.

143
00:08:39,948 --> 00:08:44,077
You left the house a mess
and you kicked in your own front door...

144
00:08:44,577 --> 00:08:46,329
...because it's a free country.

145
00:08:46,538 --> 00:08:48,915
Kim Wexler is very good.
She'll make it work.

146
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,042
What about the money?

147
00:08:53,336 --> 00:08:57,966
If she knows about it, she'll tell.
Right? I mean, she'll have to tell.

148
00:08:58,174 --> 00:09:02,846
Well, like they say in Silicon Valley,
"It's not a bug, it's a feature."

149
00:09:03,054 --> 00:09:05,432
You ever hear of a bargaining chip?

150
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,977
What we have right here
is the mother of all bargaining chips.

151
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:11,396
As in...

152
00:09:11,604 --> 00:09:13,606
...you expect us to give this back?

153
00:09:16,735 --> 00:09:18,653
We are not giving this back.

154
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:22,115
We are not guilty.
This money belongs to us.

155
00:09:22,323 --> 00:09:24,242
We-- Well, I mean, Craig earned it.

156
00:09:24,451 --> 00:09:25,785
- I worked very hard.
- Yeah.

157
00:09:25,994 --> 00:09:28,538
- Weekends and holidays, all unpaid.
- All unpaid.

158
00:09:28,747 --> 00:09:31,124
Always.
And just because you're salary...

159
00:09:31,332 --> 00:09:33,334
...doesn't mean
you don't deserve overtime.

160
00:09:33,543 --> 00:09:36,755
- I think that's only fair.
- Really, that's what this is about, right?

161
00:09:36,963 --> 00:09:38,339
- Fairness.
- Fairness, right.

162
00:09:38,548 --> 00:09:40,091
I mean, not just what's legal.

163
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:45,221
You wanna talk about legal,
slavery, that used to be legal.

164
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:48,183
Human slavery. So....

165
00:09:49,184 --> 00:09:52,187
Yeah, this is right up there with that.

166
00:10:00,904 --> 00:10:05,033
Please, just don't tell anyone
about the money.

167
00:10:05,408 --> 00:10:06,659
I can't take a bribe.

168
00:10:06,868 --> 00:10:08,411
- Who would know?
- We won't tell.

169
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,497
- Yeah, take it.
- I can't take it.

170
00:10:10,705 --> 00:10:13,291
Please, didn't you say
that you wanted to help us?

171
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,544
Just pretend you never saw
the money. How hard is that?

172
00:10:16,753 --> 00:10:18,338
Take it.

173
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,215
Take it.

174
00:10:20,423 --> 00:10:22,717
I can't-- I can't take a bribe.

175
00:10:27,097 --> 00:10:28,681
But you know what I Ca--?

176
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,475
I can take a retainer.

177
00:10:31,434 --> 00:10:34,312
- A retainer?
- Yeah, for my services.

178
00:10:34,938 --> 00:10:36,481
As your lawyer.

179
00:10:37,023 --> 00:10:40,068
- You're not our lawyer.
- Well, not yet.

180
00:10:40,276 --> 00:10:46,741
Look, I know that HHM is shiny and it's
slick and it's chock-full of lawyers...

181
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,119
...and compared to them I'm like...

182
00:10:49,327 --> 00:10:52,288
...a kiddie lemonade stand
trying to compete with Walmart...

183
00:10:52,497 --> 00:10:53,832
...but here's the thing:

184
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,083
What are you gonna get from me...

185
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,377
...that you won't get
from those other guys?

186
00:10:57,585 --> 00:11:00,505
Passion. Commitment.

187
00:11:00,713 --> 00:11:03,007
Ask yourself this: Who found you?

188
00:11:03,675 --> 00:11:08,179
I don't see Howard Hamlin ruining his
$300 Gucci loafers out here.

189
00:11:08,388 --> 00:11:12,100
If you're with me, you're my number one
client, morning, noon or night.

190
00:11:12,308 --> 00:11:16,896
You call me, I'm there.
I would be singularly devoted to you.

191
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,527
Why not?

192
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:24,070
I'm sorry.

193
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:25,613
You're just....

194
00:11:28,032 --> 00:11:30,451
Just what?

195
00:11:31,077 --> 00:11:34,998
You're the kind of lawyer
guilty people hire.

196
00:12:06,154 --> 00:12:07,322
Did it make the paper?

197
00:12:08,531 --> 00:12:10,450
- What?
- Did it make the paper?

198
00:12:10,658 --> 00:12:12,452
Did what make the paper?

199
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,495
Okay, well,
probably missed the deadline...

200
00:12:14,704 --> 00:12:16,206
...but check it out tomorrow morning.

201
00:12:16,414 --> 00:12:20,627
Front page. The Kettlemans,
all four of them, safe and sound.

202
00:12:20,835 --> 00:12:23,463
- Looks like you called it.
- Yeah.

203
00:12:23,671 --> 00:12:25,006
Camping, you know?

204
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:29,969
Pretty much right in their own backyard.
Well, five miles above it. Jesus.

205
00:12:30,178 --> 00:12:32,555
The night I had.
I got pine nuts in my shoes.

206
00:12:32,764 --> 00:12:35,600
But, I mean, can you believe it?

207
00:12:36,643 --> 00:12:40,647
I guess you can. It's just, you know...

208
00:12:40,855 --> 00:12:45,693
...you assume that criminals
are gonna be smarter than they are.

209
00:12:45,902 --> 00:12:49,822
I don't know, it kind of
breaks my heart a little.

210
00:12:54,494 --> 00:12:56,663
Not the loquacious sort, are you?

211
00:12:56,871 --> 00:13:00,625
We can't all be as blessed as you.

212
00:13:01,501 --> 00:13:04,504
- Well, thanks for your help.
- Don't mention it.

213
00:13:04,712 --> 00:13:07,924
And if you ever need any assistance....

214
00:13:24,524 --> 00:13:27,819
Whoa, whoa, why is my client
in handcuffs? This man is innocent.

215
00:13:28,027 --> 00:13:32,073
He's a victim.
Why on earth would he be cuffed?

216
00:13:32,282 --> 00:13:34,200
Go ahead, take them off.
There you go.

217
00:13:34,409 --> 00:13:37,328
Free at last.
Hey, did he tell you the good news?

218
00:13:37,537 --> 00:13:39,622
Never even kidnapped.
How about that?

219
00:13:39,831 --> 00:13:43,501
A family can't go on a vacation without
the whole city going on lockdown?

220
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,587
By the way, where's your partner?
You lose the coin toss?

221
00:13:46,796 --> 00:13:49,424
Because we expect an apology
from him as well as you.

222
00:13:49,632 --> 00:13:52,552
You really don't wanna push your luck
with me, scumbag.

223
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,513
We got eyes on you, asshole.
One little slip.

224
00:13:55,722 --> 00:13:57,390
- Just one.
- Yeah.

225
00:13:57,598 --> 00:14:00,143
Well, you're both very pretty, so....

226
00:14:05,606 --> 00:14:09,736
Well, I believe I did more
than what you asked of me...

227
00:14:09,944 --> 00:14:14,532
...so that would make us square, yes?

228
00:14:14,741 --> 00:14:16,075
Great.

229
00:14:17,785 --> 00:14:20,413
- You need a ride?
- Camping?

230
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,460
- You expect me to believe that shit?
- Yeah, I know.

231
00:14:25,668 --> 00:14:28,296
The things people do, huh?

232
00:14:28,504 --> 00:14:32,383
They decide to go camping
right after I run my little offer by you?

233
00:14:32,592 --> 00:14:36,220
Could be argued that all of life
is one great coincidence.

234
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:45,646
Somebody told those people
to go camping.

235
00:14:46,064 --> 00:14:48,066
Somebody warned them.

236
00:14:49,692 --> 00:14:51,235
They're very woodsy.

237
00:14:51,694 --> 00:14:52,987
And between you and me...

238
00:14:53,196 --> 00:14:55,656
...they're rash when it comes to
the decision-making.

239
00:14:55,865 --> 00:14:58,284
They're not really
the plan-ahead types.

240
00:14:58,493 --> 00:15:02,830
Yeah, I'd cut the cute attitude
right about now if I were you.

241
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:07,043
You ratted on me.
There will be consequences.

242
00:15:09,087 --> 00:15:10,922
Hey, if somebody
warned the Kettlemans...

243
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:14,300
...it was probably somebody
who was worried about those kids.

244
00:15:18,763 --> 00:15:20,348
Know how much trouble you caused me?

245
00:15:20,556 --> 00:15:22,517
You didn't need any help getting caught.

246
00:15:22,725 --> 00:15:25,645
Okay? The neighbour ID'd you.
You were sloppy.

247
00:15:25,853 --> 00:15:29,607
Any trouble you might have,
that's on you.

248
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:32,610
Not to mention the blood in your van.

249
00:15:32,819 --> 00:15:35,988
Here's a thought: Ajax, Formula 409.

250
00:15:36,197 --> 00:15:40,410
You have no idea the tap dance I had to
give those cops to get you out of here.

251
00:15:40,618 --> 00:15:44,122
You gave them probable cause
out the wazoo.

252
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:48,960
Now, whoever the somebody is
who may have warned the Kettlemans...

253
00:15:49,168 --> 00:15:53,005
...got them out of there before
you did anything even more stupid.

254
00:15:54,882 --> 00:15:58,553
You should be thanking
this Good Samaritan...

255
00:15:58,761 --> 00:16:03,182
...because whoever he is,
he did you a favour.

256
00:16:59,989 --> 00:17:03,242
Okay, I'm thinking hourly here.

257
00:17:03,451 --> 00:17:06,370
There were some
special circumstances...

258
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:13,419
...so our elite-tier pricing
would be $950 an hour.

259
00:17:14,045 --> 00:17:17,215
Round off to 20 hours.

260
00:17:18,257 --> 00:17:19,884
Nineteen thousand.

261
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,346
Plus 1000 for travel expenses.

262
00:17:23,554 --> 00:17:26,807
Consulting fees, 1500.

263
00:17:27,016 --> 00:17:29,602
And research.

264
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,437
Five for filing fees.

265
00:17:31,646 --> 00:17:32,939
I ate on the road.

266
00:17:35,233 --> 00:17:37,026
And storage fees.

267
00:17:41,405 --> 00:17:43,407
<i>Miscellaneous expenses.</i>

268
00:17:47,828 --> 00:17:51,749
Upon this rock, I will build my church.

269
00:17:58,005 --> 00:17:59,924
Double-breasted or single, sir?

270
00:18:00,132 --> 00:18:02,718
Single. And I want you to cut
the arm holes high, okay?

271
00:18:02,927 --> 00:18:06,639
- Of course.
- And trim through the middle. Trim.

272
00:18:06,847 --> 00:18:08,224
Cloth?

273
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:10,810
Well, wool.

274
00:18:11,018 --> 00:18:12,353
Yeah.

275
00:18:15,147 --> 00:18:18,442
Super 170 Tasmanian wool.

276
00:18:18,651 --> 00:18:20,903
- Beautiful choice, sir.
- Thanks.

277
00:18:21,362 --> 00:18:23,656
- Navy, all right?
- Yeah.

278
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,409
Oh, that's it, perfect. Pinstripe.

279
00:18:26,867 --> 00:18:28,411
Shall we discuss shirts?

280
00:18:28,619 --> 00:18:32,373
Okay, I'm gonna need your finest
sea island cotton...

281
00:18:32,582 --> 00:18:34,959
...with a white club collar
and French cuffs.

282
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:36,377
I have the very thing.

283
00:18:36,586 --> 00:18:38,838
And I'm assuming
you want to see some ties.

284
00:18:39,046 --> 00:18:43,050
Yeah, I was picturing something
in a light-blue knit.

285
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:45,678
- Okay.
- Oh, and could you make sure...

286
00:18:45,886 --> 00:18:48,472
...those are real mother-of-pearl
buttons on the shirts?

287
00:18:48,681 --> 00:18:52,852
- Okay? None of this fake plastic crap.
- Of course. I'll be right back.

288
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,062
Some coffee, David?

289
00:19:24,717 --> 00:19:25,968
Here we are.

290
00:19:28,804 --> 00:19:30,264
Shall we?

291
00:19:30,556 --> 00:19:32,600
Yeah, let's go.

292
00:19:35,436 --> 00:19:36,854
Yeah.

293
00:19:37,271 --> 00:19:39,774
So, what do you think?

294
00:19:41,275 --> 00:19:43,819
Strawberry Fields Forever?

295
00:19:44,779 --> 00:19:47,657
No, are you crazy? Not even close.

296
00:19:47,865 --> 00:19:49,033
Yes, it is, look.

297
00:19:49,241 --> 00:19:52,953
No, no, it's way more
Sassafras Glow. Way more.

298
00:19:53,162 --> 00:19:56,248
Use your eyes.
Strawberry Fields Forever.

299
00:19:56,457 --> 00:19:58,209
Ladies, back me up. Hey.

300
00:19:58,417 --> 00:20:00,753
Sassafras Glow, am I right?

301
00:20:00,961 --> 00:20:03,631
Maybe Rhapsody in Blond, but....

302
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:07,927
See, they agree with me. What happened
to "the customer is always right"?

303
00:20:08,135 --> 00:20:11,681
- Sassafras Glow. Mix it up, all right?
- You're wrong. You see.

304
00:20:11,889 --> 00:20:15,017
Big deal. I'll wash it out
in the morning. No biggie, jeez.

305
00:20:15,226 --> 00:20:17,144
It's bleach. It doesn't wash out.

306
00:20:17,353 --> 00:20:19,522
What? It's permanent?

307
00:20:19,939 --> 00:20:22,650
We'll Photoshop the colour, okay?

308
00:20:22,858 --> 00:20:24,318
Change of plan, ladies.

309
00:20:24,527 --> 00:20:28,322
I wanna go with a simple
curling iron job, okay?

310
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:32,076
Give me, like, ringlets,
you know, on top.

311
00:20:32,284 --> 00:20:34,328
Like Tony Curtis in <i>Spartacus.</i>

312
00:20:34,537 --> 00:20:38,124
Yeah, like the bath scene
in <i>Spartacus.</i>

313
00:20:40,835 --> 00:20:44,213
Stop talking about it.
Make me beautiful already.

314
00:21:07,111 --> 00:21:11,115
<i>Hello, you've reached the law offices</i>
<i>of James M. McGill, Esquire...</i>

315
00:21:11,323 --> 00:21:12,908
<i>... a lawyer you can trust.</i>

316
00:21:13,117 --> 00:21:18,581
<i>Kindly leave your information at the tone</i>
<i>and Mr. McGill will phone you promptly.</i>

317
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:20,207
Hey.

318
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,251
It's me. Hi.

319
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:26,964
Anyway, <i>The Thing</i> is playing
downtown on Saturday.

320
00:21:27,173 --> 00:21:30,301
Thought you might be up
for some Kurt Russell action.

321
00:21:30,509 --> 00:21:34,805
I owe you one, so why don't we just
grab some dinner first, my treat?

322
00:21:37,892 --> 00:21:40,436
And, you know, if not,
can you give me a call anyway?

323
00:21:40,644 --> 00:21:43,606
I really wanna talk to you. Okay, bye.

324
00:21:44,482 --> 00:21:46,192
- Come in.
- Hey.

325
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,402
Hey. Hey.

326
00:21:48,652 --> 00:21:50,362
How goes it?

327
00:21:51,489 --> 00:21:53,449
Tricky, for sure.

328
00:21:53,657 --> 00:21:56,410
Craig and Betsy really put us in a corner
with the police...

329
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:58,037
...not to mention the press.

330
00:21:58,245 --> 00:22:01,373
But this camping story of theirs...

331
00:22:01,582 --> 00:22:04,418
...they've been keeping it
consistent at least.

332
00:22:05,169 --> 00:22:08,923
If it's okay with you, I think I should
talk them into hiring a PR firm.

333
00:22:09,131 --> 00:22:11,425
Certainly for the next couple of weeks.

334
00:22:14,428 --> 00:22:16,639
So okay on the PR firm?

335
00:22:17,181 --> 00:22:20,893
- Do you have a minute?
- Yeah, of course. What's up?

336
00:22:21,101 --> 00:22:22,770
Take a ride with me.

337
00:22:23,103 --> 00:22:24,605
Okay.

338
00:22:25,314 --> 00:22:26,899
Where are we going?

339
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:53,133
Yeah.

340
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,095
Shit.

341
00:22:56,762 --> 00:22:58,264
Yep.

342
00:22:59,807 --> 00:23:04,144
That's-- I mean, that's my suit, right?

343
00:23:04,353 --> 00:23:07,523
- Am I crazy here?
- No, you're not crazy.

344
00:23:07,731 --> 00:23:08,941
Look at the logo.

345
00:23:09,149 --> 00:23:12,903
That's our logo.
He's just straight-up copying us.

346
00:23:13,112 --> 00:23:16,490
I mean, what the hell
is he thinking with this?

347
00:23:18,033 --> 00:23:22,288
- Really, he's, you know, a free spirit.
- Yeah.

348
00:23:22,496 --> 00:23:23,789
That's one way to put it.

349
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:29,461
You two are still friends, right?

350
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:31,672
- I wouldn't exactly--
- You talk, though.

351
00:23:31,881 --> 00:23:34,341
- Not really.
- Still, you're the one he called...

352
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:37,469
...when he found the Kettlemans'
camped halfway up the Sandias.

353
00:23:38,262 --> 00:23:40,556
He was looking out
for his own client, that's all.

354
00:23:40,764 --> 00:23:45,060
This isn't the third degree, Kim. I really
don't care one way or the other. I just....

355
00:23:48,981 --> 00:23:51,525
He's really forcing my hand here.

356
00:24:15,716 --> 00:24:17,843
- Hey.
- Hey.

357
00:24:18,302 --> 00:24:20,262
Am I interrupting?

358
00:24:20,471 --> 00:24:23,933
Not at all. Perfect timing. Come on.

359
00:24:25,351 --> 00:24:28,437
Sit. Have a massage, free of charge.

360
00:24:29,271 --> 00:24:31,065
- Okay.
- You gotta try the footbath too.

361
00:24:31,273 --> 00:24:33,984
Oh, yeah.

362
00:24:34,193 --> 00:24:36,362
Give the old dogs a rest.

363
00:24:43,535 --> 00:24:46,705
- Go for the deep-tissue setting--
- Is that the small fist?

364
00:24:46,914 --> 00:24:49,458
- Use the-- It's three arrows.
- I did. I pressed it.

365
00:24:49,667 --> 00:24:52,044
Yeah. Now, you feel it?

366
00:24:53,253 --> 00:24:55,339
- Now, relax, okay?
- Okay.

367
00:24:55,547 --> 00:24:57,841
You deserve a break today.

368
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:06,058
- It's very nice.
- Told you.

369
00:25:06,266 --> 00:25:07,893
I get this free every night.

370
00:25:08,102 --> 00:25:11,855
- Just one of the perks of salon living.
- The others being...?

371
00:25:12,064 --> 00:25:15,275
- Free cucumber water, obviously.
- Obviously.

372
00:25:15,484 --> 00:25:17,611
Free Mani-pedis?

373
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,279
Deep-discount Mani-pedis.

374
00:25:19,488 --> 00:25:21,198
The ladies still gotta eat, you know?

375
00:25:21,407 --> 00:25:24,410
- Well, it's still a deal.
- Yeah.

376
00:25:25,619 --> 00:25:27,746
You're living like a king, then.

377
00:25:44,096 --> 00:25:45,139
What's this?

378
00:25:45,347 --> 00:25:48,225
- Is this a cease and desist?
- Yep.

379
00:25:49,226 --> 00:25:51,145
How pissed was he?

380
00:25:52,312 --> 00:25:55,065
His head didn't actually explode,
but pretty damn pissed.

381
00:25:55,274 --> 00:25:58,902
- Like this-won't-end-well-for-you pissed.
- Yeah.

382
00:25:59,111 --> 00:26:00,738
- How about that?
- Jimmy.

383
00:26:01,739 --> 00:26:02,781
This is serious.

384
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,116
- I know.
- Do you?

385
00:26:04,324 --> 00:26:07,995
I mean, what the hell
is with that billboard?

386
00:26:09,455 --> 00:26:11,874
I know you have a problem
with Hamlin...

387
00:26:12,082 --> 00:26:13,917
...but I just don't get your angle here.

388
00:26:14,126 --> 00:26:16,628
Aren't you trying to build
your own law practice?

389
00:26:16,837 --> 00:26:20,674
Instead, you're spending God knows
how much money turning yourself...

390
00:26:20,883 --> 00:26:25,721
...into a little Hamlin clone. I mean,
why are you making this personal?

391
00:26:25,929 --> 00:26:28,974
- It's not personal.
- It is so personal.

392
00:26:29,183 --> 00:26:31,643
It is completely and totally personal.

393
00:26:31,852 --> 00:26:34,897
- No, no, no. It's not. Nope.
- Yes. Yes, it is.

394
00:26:35,397 --> 00:26:36,982
Stop trying to pretend.

395
00:26:37,191 --> 00:26:40,611
I can advertise, can't I?
What, do I have to clear everything...

396
00:26:40,819 --> 00:26:43,530
- ...past the great Howard?
- You can advertise all you want.

397
00:26:43,739 --> 00:26:46,700
That billboard is not advertising.
That is a declaration of war.

398
00:26:46,909 --> 00:26:49,161
- "Declaration of war."
- Right at Hamlin's exit.

399
00:26:49,369 --> 00:26:51,872
- You know he drives by it every day.
- It's business.

400
00:26:52,081 --> 00:26:53,582
I'm building a brand.

401
00:26:53,791 --> 00:26:56,043
You're ripping off a brand.

402
00:26:56,418 --> 00:26:58,504
There is nothing original in that ad.

403
00:26:58,712 --> 00:27:00,756
It certainly doesn't represent
Jimmy McGill.

404
00:27:00,964 --> 00:27:03,592
Hey. All right, now,
he fired the first shot, okay?

405
00:27:03,801 --> 00:27:08,180
Trying to keep me from using my name?
My own name, Kim?

406
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,015
I get that.

407
00:27:10,516 --> 00:27:12,351
But this?

408
00:27:13,018 --> 00:27:15,187
- You're better than this.
- I'm better than this?

409
00:27:15,395 --> 00:27:17,481
- Yes, you are.
- I'm better than this? I'm bet--

410
00:27:17,689 --> 00:27:19,733
Well, you're better
than that schmuck Hamlin.

411
00:27:19,942 --> 00:27:20,984
Oh, come on, Jimmy.

412
00:27:21,193 --> 00:27:24,780
You could work anywhere. You could be
somewhere where they appreciate you.

413
00:27:24,988 --> 00:27:26,657
Where they see how valuable you are.

414
00:27:26,865 --> 00:27:29,368
Where, I don't know,
maybe they care about you.

415
00:27:40,129 --> 00:27:42,089
Forget it, okay?

416
00:27:42,297 --> 00:27:45,217
If Hamlin wants to come after me,
he knows where I am.

417
00:27:45,425 --> 00:27:48,804
I'll be ready. Guns blazing.

418
00:28:07,406 --> 00:28:10,033
The cease and desist
is just the beginning.

419
00:28:10,242 --> 00:28:13,787
The next step is an injunction.
You can't win this fight.

420
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:45,068
Your Honour,
I'm a humble solo practitioner...

421
00:28:45,277 --> 00:28:49,573
...merely trying to ply my trade in an
aggressive and evolving marketplace.

422
00:28:49,781 --> 00:28:52,534
As I've argued repeatedly,
this is trademark infringement.

423
00:28:52,743 --> 00:28:55,704
Mr. McGill's new logo
is an absolute copy of ours.

424
00:28:56,496 --> 00:28:58,665
I think it falls
firmly under fair use.

425
00:28:58,874 --> 00:29:02,211
Fair use? You're clearly profiting,
so fair use doesn't apply.

426
00:29:02,419 --> 00:29:06,798
There are only so many fonts out there.
Does Mr. Hamlin outright own them all?

427
00:29:07,007 --> 00:29:10,302
No. But we've been using
this particular font for 12 years now.

428
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:14,181
And it, in concert with our tri-rectangle
graphic and Hamlindigo blue...

429
00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:17,351
...constitutes
a trademark-brand identifier.

430
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:20,771
Whoa, back up. "Hamlindigo blue"?

431
00:29:21,188 --> 00:29:23,440
Yes. That is our trademark name.

432
00:29:24,233 --> 00:29:29,571
Holy crap, you seriously named
a colour Hamlindigo? That is....

433
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,617
From the man dressed exactly like me.
Your Honour...

434
00:29:33,825 --> 00:29:36,536
...I feel like I'm in the mirror routine
with Groucho Marx.

435
00:29:36,745 --> 00:29:39,039
Like we should be standing
waving our arms.

436
00:29:39,248 --> 00:29:41,083
Really? I don't see it.

437
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:43,710
In addition, the name McGill
appears in both logos...

438
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,005
...which Mr. McGill is hoping
to further confuse potential clients.

439
00:29:47,214 --> 00:29:49,174
So I can't advertise
under my own name now?

440
00:29:49,383 --> 00:29:50,509
I'm to be penalised...

441
00:29:50,717 --> 00:29:53,637
...because I happen to share a name
with one of HHM's partners?

442
00:29:53,845 --> 00:29:55,889
You can't take my name from me.

443
00:29:56,098 --> 00:29:58,475
The name is not the problem here,
Mr. McGill.

444
00:29:58,684 --> 00:30:00,727
Mr. Hamlin certainly seems to think so.

445
00:30:00,936 --> 00:30:03,021
I mean, he wants me
to change my name...

446
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:06,650
...because he claims that, what,
it's some kind of threat to his business?

447
00:30:06,858 --> 00:30:08,819
- Your Honour--
- This is restraint of trade.

448
00:30:09,027 --> 00:30:11,196
Okay, whatever happened
to the free market, huh?

449
00:30:11,405 --> 00:30:14,700
- Hamlin here wants you to tell--
- Okay, enough, Mr. McGill.

450
00:30:14,908 --> 00:30:16,743
I've heard enough.

451
00:30:17,286 --> 00:30:21,081
All right, yes, you are within your rights
to advertise using your own name.

452
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:25,919
However, in my estimation, the billboard
clearly and intentionally...

453
00:30:26,128 --> 00:30:28,964
...duplicates elements of the
Hamlin Hamlin McGill logo.

454
00:30:29,631 --> 00:30:32,968
You're actively copying their
established brand for your own gain.

455
00:30:33,176 --> 00:30:34,761
I don't see any other explanation.

456
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:38,015
- Your Honour--
- Jimmy. Jimmy. Wise up.

457
00:30:38,223 --> 00:30:41,143
The billboard must come down
within 48 hours.

458
00:30:43,603 --> 00:30:46,231
This is a classic
David-versus-Goliath story.

459
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,444
I mean, you got your gigantic law firm
stomping all over the little guy.

460
00:30:51,403 --> 00:30:53,488
But it's investigative journalism
at its best.

461
00:30:53,697 --> 00:30:55,699
It's right up your alley.

462
00:30:59,161 --> 00:31:03,206
Yeah, okay. Well, let me give you
my cell just in case.

463
00:31:03,707 --> 00:31:05,959
Yeah. Thank you.

464
00:31:15,427 --> 00:31:18,138
Can I get the news desk, please?
I got a hot tip.

465
00:31:18,347 --> 00:31:20,515
<i>Wanna be the station</i>
<i>that brought down big law?</i>

466
00:31:20,724 --> 00:31:23,560
You could be like the reporters
that brought down big tobacco.

467
00:31:23,769 --> 00:31:25,896
Look, I'm talking
Woodward and Bernstein here.

468
00:31:26,104 --> 00:31:29,649
Your exposé on predatory ATM fees,
that was--

469
00:31:30,275 --> 00:31:32,152
Well, it's a miscarriage of justice.

470
00:31:32,361 --> 00:31:35,280
And I think your viewers
would be very, very interested...

471
00:31:35,489 --> 00:31:39,326
...and grateful to you
for exposing this injustice.

472
00:31:39,534 --> 00:31:42,204
I wouldn't characterise this
as a community health risk...

473
00:31:42,412 --> 00:31:44,039
...but it's community interest.

474
00:31:44,247 --> 00:31:48,543
No, yes.
HHM is a pillar of the community. Yes.

475
00:31:48,752 --> 00:31:51,671
No, the war is
an important story as well.

476
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,383
That's why this action is so egregious.

477
00:31:54,591 --> 00:31:55,759
Sure. Okay.

478
00:31:55,967 --> 00:31:58,303
<i>Well, at least consider</i>
<i>the human interest angle here.</i>

479
00:31:59,471 --> 00:32:02,557
Are you kidding? "Lawyer pulls
himself up by his bootstraps...

480
00:32:02,766 --> 00:32:06,353
...only to be ground under the heel
of the old-money mega-firm"?

481
00:32:06,561 --> 00:32:08,605
That's hearts and minds.

482
00:32:11,817 --> 00:32:14,236
Yeah, I have your number too, so....

483
00:32:14,444 --> 00:32:16,613
Yeah, I see. Okay.

484
00:33:05,036 --> 00:33:06,997
Oh, no, no, no, man.
Can't touch the goods.

485
00:33:07,205 --> 00:33:09,374
I signed the form.
Only I can touch the camera.

486
00:33:09,583 --> 00:33:12,461
Fine. May I suggest you
widen the frame to include--

487
00:33:12,669 --> 00:33:15,005
The billboard is the story, okay?

488
00:33:15,213 --> 00:33:17,340
I'm also the story.

489
00:33:18,008 --> 00:33:20,552
- So gotta get me in there.
- Okay, so get on your mark.

490
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,971
No offence to your minutes
of experience...

491
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:27,058
...but I'd like to see what we got
before we do this, okay? Other guy.

492
00:33:28,393 --> 00:33:30,520
Other guy. Only other guy that's here.

493
00:33:30,729 --> 00:33:32,981
Go stand where I was standing.

494
00:33:33,607 --> 00:33:34,816
Shrink down. Shrink down.

495
00:33:35,192 --> 00:33:36,526
Yeah, scrunch.

496
00:33:36,735 --> 00:33:37,777
Yeah.

497
00:33:37,986 --> 00:33:41,198
Okay, widen the frame,
get the billboard.

498
00:33:41,406 --> 00:33:43,658
Okay, now get me. Me, me, me.

499
00:33:43,867 --> 00:33:45,202
No, not me.

500
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:46,953
Get him. He's me.

501
00:33:47,162 --> 00:33:48,747
Yeah, like that.

502
00:33:49,122 --> 00:33:50,499
- Got it?
- Yeah.

503
00:33:50,957 --> 00:33:52,000
Good.

504
00:33:53,585 --> 00:33:54,753
Okay.

505
00:33:54,961 --> 00:33:57,797
- Is he in the shot?
- No. Dude, just go.

506
00:33:58,006 --> 00:34:00,258
- How do I look?
- Great.

507
00:34:00,467 --> 00:34:01,760
Well....

508
00:34:01,968 --> 00:34:04,304
No, this is my good side.

509
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:07,724
- Is the billboard in?
- Yes. Jesus, just--

510
00:34:07,933 --> 00:34:10,018
You said 100 for one hour,
not fricking three.

511
00:34:10,227 --> 00:34:13,355
You have a journalistic impulse.
You're a go-getter. You know that?

512
00:34:13,939 --> 00:34:14,981
Go get this.

513
00:34:16,024 --> 00:34:17,526
All right, count me down.

514
00:34:18,193 --> 00:34:21,196
In five, four, three....

515
00:34:21,404 --> 00:34:23,240
Gravitas.

516
00:34:26,743 --> 00:34:31,122
I'm James McGill. Like most Americans,
I'm a self-made man.

517
00:34:31,331 --> 00:34:34,042
I put myself through law school.

518
00:34:34,251 --> 00:34:36,419
Working in the courts
as a public defender...

519
00:34:36,628 --> 00:34:39,548
...I represented those
with nowhere else to turn.

520
00:34:39,756 --> 00:34:42,509
I believe in service.
It's what I built my career on.

521
00:34:42,717 --> 00:34:46,846
But I've also had a dream,
a dream that many of us have.

522
00:34:47,055 --> 00:34:50,267
A dream to own my own business.

523
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:56,064
Well, I scrimped and I saved and finally,
I was able to buy one billboard.

524
00:34:57,566 --> 00:35:02,153
A tiny foray into advertising
for my fledgling law firm.

525
00:35:03,071 --> 00:35:06,032
I've always been told that America
is the land of opportunity...

526
00:35:06,241 --> 00:35:10,328
...and I believed it. Until today.

527
00:35:12,247 --> 00:35:14,666
Not 24 hours
after my billboard went up...

528
00:35:14,874 --> 00:35:16,751
...a large law firm came after me.

529
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,045
They said
that I was hurting their business.

530
00:35:19,254 --> 00:35:23,592
They're rich, they're powerful.
I'm just one man.

531
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,177
So who do you think
the court sided with?

532
00:35:28,054 --> 00:35:32,809
So now my little billboard comes down.

533
00:35:33,018 --> 00:35:35,312
Let me tell you something:
If they want a fight...

534
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,107
...they're gonna get a fight
because I'm not giving up--

535
00:35:39,316 --> 00:35:41,901
Holy shit. Dude, the dude!

536
00:35:42,485 --> 00:35:43,653
- Dude, the dude!
- Help!

537
00:35:43,862 --> 00:35:44,904
The worker guy.

538
00:35:45,113 --> 00:35:46,281
Shit.

539
00:35:46,489 --> 00:35:48,700
Please. Get me down!

540
00:35:48,908 --> 00:35:50,327
- Dude.
- Okay. Call 91 1.

541
00:35:50,535 --> 00:35:52,120
Help me.

542
00:35:52,329 --> 00:35:53,788
- You got a cell?
- Yeah, yeah.

543
00:35:53,997 --> 00:35:57,292
- Please.
- Yeah, a guy just fell off a billboard....

544
00:36:10,472 --> 00:36:11,514
Help me.

545
00:36:18,188 --> 00:36:21,274
I don't think that's very safe.
You need to be licensed for that.

546
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,568
- Help me.
- Man.

547
00:36:30,033 --> 00:36:34,120
Not looking down. One rung at a time.

548
00:36:34,746 --> 00:36:36,164
Not looking down.

549
00:36:54,974 --> 00:36:56,643
Hurry up.

550
00:36:56,851 --> 00:36:58,520
Come get me.

551
00:36:59,771 --> 00:37:01,314
Help.

552
00:37:06,569 --> 00:37:08,279
Help me.

553
00:37:11,825 --> 00:37:14,160
- Sir, I'm right here.
- Please.

554
00:37:15,036 --> 00:37:16,162
Please.

555
00:37:22,377 --> 00:37:23,753
- Pull me up.
- Here.

556
00:37:23,962 --> 00:37:25,463
- Grab my hand.
- Pull me up.

557
00:37:32,971 --> 00:37:34,723
Pull me up.

558
00:38:04,961 --> 00:38:06,337
You okay?

559
00:38:06,546 --> 00:38:08,339
Took you long enough.

560
00:38:19,184 --> 00:38:23,688
<i>I was scared, yes. I mean, I'm not really</i>
<i>a big fan of heights, let me tell you...</i>

561
00:38:23,897 --> 00:38:26,191
<i>... but, you know,</i>
<i>something inside me said:</i>

562
00:38:26,399 --> 00:38:27,609
<i>"You have to do this."</i>

563
00:38:27,817 --> 00:38:31,196
<i>I'm sure our city's first responders</i>
<i>would have been here momentarily....</i>

564
00:38:31,404 --> 00:38:34,157
Jesus, can you believe this guy?

565
00:38:34,365 --> 00:38:36,618
Whole thing was a publicity stunt.
It's gotta be.

566
00:38:36,826 --> 00:38:39,162
<i>That's all anybody wants</i>
<i>when they're in trouble.</i>

567
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,289
<i>Didn't think life was gonna call on me...</i>

568
00:38:41,498 --> 00:38:43,249
You don't think
anyone's gonna buy this?

569
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:47,337
<i>- ... in an immediate, life-threatening way.</i>
- It's hard to say. People love a hero.

570
00:38:47,545 --> 00:38:49,214
<i>You take it as it comes, right?</i>

571
00:38:49,422 --> 00:38:53,718
<i>The universe put me in that spot</i>
<i>at that moment. Who am I to say no?</i>

572
00:38:53,927 --> 00:38:57,597
<i>You know, as a lawyer,</i>
<i>well, I help people every day.</i>

573
00:38:57,806 --> 00:38:59,432
Whole thing's a damn stunt.

574
00:38:59,641 --> 00:39:03,478
<i>I think my clients know</i>
<i>that when they're in trouble, I'm there.</i>

575
00:39:03,686 --> 00:39:05,605
<i>I'm just a guy</i>
<i>who was in the right--</i>

576
00:39:38,054 --> 00:39:41,474
<i>You have seven new messages.</i>

577
00:39:43,893 --> 00:39:47,105
<i>To listen to your messages, press one.</i>

578
00:39:48,189 --> 00:39:52,068
<i>First message. Received at 5:40....</i>

579
00:40:28,521 --> 00:40:30,899
It's just showmanship, Chuck.

580
00:40:32,859 --> 00:40:34,611
Yeah, right.

581
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,145
You're early.

582
00:41:09,354 --> 00:41:11,022
- Did you--?
- Yeah, I grounded myself.

583
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,649
Hey, big day.

584
00:41:12,857 --> 00:41:14,651
My phone's ringing off the hook.

585
00:41:14,859 --> 00:41:17,320
I have three consults before lunchtime.

586
00:41:17,528 --> 00:41:19,697
- Three.
- That's great, Jimmy.

587
00:41:19,906 --> 00:41:21,324
Yep.

588
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:24,285
The worm has turned.

589
00:41:24,661 --> 00:41:29,040
That's really great. So to what
do you credit this sudden change?

590
00:41:29,248 --> 00:41:31,834
Well, I gotta admit, you were right.

591
00:41:32,043 --> 00:41:33,378
How so?

592
00:41:33,586 --> 00:41:38,549
Well, you told me to keep plugging and
do good work and the clients will come.

593
00:41:38,758 --> 00:41:41,844
You know, I'll admit,
I almost lost faith a couple times.

594
00:41:42,053 --> 00:41:45,431
But the worm has turned.

595
00:41:48,893 --> 00:41:53,314
So, what, you've been getting referrals
from your PD clients?

596
00:41:53,523 --> 00:41:55,483
Yeah. You know, you work hard...

597
00:41:55,692 --> 00:41:58,903
...show you got half a brain and
people come knocking, like you said.

598
00:41:59,112 --> 00:42:01,739
I just needed to get my face out there.

599
00:42:02,281 --> 00:42:05,201
So the prosecutors then,
referring clients.

600
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:09,122
Yeah. Yep, exactly.

601
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:10,373
Was it Bergeron?

602
00:42:10,581 --> 00:42:13,418
When I was starting out,
she sent me a couple of good ones.

603
00:42:13,626 --> 00:42:18,214
Yeah, it was someone on her team,
you know.

604
00:42:18,423 --> 00:42:22,385
I mean, hey, it just took
some elbow grease and clean living.

605
00:42:22,593 --> 00:42:24,721
People noticed.

606
00:42:25,972 --> 00:42:27,849
I knew you had it in you.

607
00:42:29,892 --> 00:42:31,728
I don't see the <i>Journal</i> here.

608
00:42:35,148 --> 00:42:37,734
- Here you go.
- No, <i>Albuquerque Journal.</i> It's not here.

609
00:42:38,818 --> 00:42:40,319
Oh, yeah.

610
00:42:40,528 --> 00:42:41,654
I didn't see it outside.

611
00:42:41,863 --> 00:42:43,906
It wasn't out there? It's always out there.

612
00:42:44,115 --> 00:42:45,408
I didn't see it.

613
00:42:45,616 --> 00:42:49,037
Maybe they forgot to deliver it.
Maybe some kids grabbed it.

614
00:42:49,245 --> 00:42:52,373
Because if there's one thing kids love,
it's local print journalism.

615
00:42:52,582 --> 00:42:55,626
I don't know what to tell you,
you got a ton of reading material.

616
00:42:55,835 --> 00:42:59,297
Look, hey. <i>Financial Times.</i>

00:42:59,505 --> 00:43:02,592
You know, I know Albuquerque
is a hub of global intrigue...

618
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,554
- ...but you think that'll tide you over?
- Fine, but if it's not here tomorrow...

00:43:06,763 --> 00:43:08,347
...I need you
to call the subscription office.

620
00:43:08,556 --> 00:43:09,724
Yeah, will do.

621
00:43:09,932 --> 00:43:11,768
Look, I gotta go. I don't wanna be late.

00:43:11,976 --> 00:43:14,353
- Hey, good luck today.
- Thanks.

623
00:43:14,562 --> 00:43:16,147
Keep it up.
