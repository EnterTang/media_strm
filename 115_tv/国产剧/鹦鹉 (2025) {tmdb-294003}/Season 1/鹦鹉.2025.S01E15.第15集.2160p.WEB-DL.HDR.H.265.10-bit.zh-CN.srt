(Tale of The Nine Tailed)

00:01:23,277 --> 00:01:28,716
(Chapter 15: The Destiny That Is You)

3
00:01:32,347 --> 00:01:33,518
I'd like to know one thing.

4
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:36,787
What made you decide...

5
00:01:37,558 --> 00:01:38,688
to team up with me?

6
00:01:39,787 --> 00:01:42,597
Probably the same reason you decided to team up with me.

7
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:53,937
What are you doing here?

8
00:01:54,038 --> 00:01:55,838
You must die for me to live.

9
00:01:56,277 --> 00:01:58,038
I'll end this all myself.

10
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:01,008
Don't do this. If you do...

11
00:02:01,008 --> 00:02:02,107
Farewell.

12
00:02:11,887 --> 00:02:14,657
See? Ji A warned you...

13
00:02:15,657 --> 00:02:17,127
not to do this.

14
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:20,627
What? You're not...

15
00:02:21,527 --> 00:02:22,737
You're not Ji A.

16
00:02:23,767 --> 00:02:25,398
How could you fail to recognize your own master?

17
00:02:25,568 --> 00:02:27,038
You darn insect.

18
00:02:27,637 --> 00:02:29,708
How dare you? I let you live longer than you deserved.

19
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:30,777
"Insect"?

20
00:02:31,237 --> 00:02:32,607
I wouldn't have stayed by your side...

21
00:02:33,508 --> 00:02:35,448
if it weren't for the ground cherries.

22
00:02:35,808 --> 00:02:38,377
I'll be honest with you. You make me sick.

23
00:02:38,648 --> 00:02:40,717
You're just a guy with an inferiority complex...

24
00:02:40,717 --> 00:02:42,818
who's neither a deity nor human.

25
00:02:47,728 --> 00:02:49,698
You talk too much.

26
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,398
You've lived for way too long.

27
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:53,368
Just go to the Underworld.

28
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:55,198
I bet your family's waiting for you.

29
00:02:58,668 --> 00:03:01,668
- Dad. - I don't even remember when.

30
00:03:02,337 --> 00:03:04,307
But there was a time when I had something I wanted to protect...

31
00:03:04,307 --> 00:03:05,337
with all my life.

32
00:03:05,337 --> 00:03:07,878
Dad, where are you coming from?

33
00:03:08,478 --> 00:03:10,718
- What did you buy, Dad? - My kids,

34
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:13,587
- wife, and mother. - Dad.

35
00:03:13,587 --> 00:03:16,418
But I barely even remember their faces.

36
00:03:20,788 --> 00:03:21,857
Darn it.

37
00:03:34,468 --> 00:03:35,637
Did you see that?

38
00:03:43,418 --> 00:03:44,577
This feels unfamiliar.

39
00:03:45,818 --> 00:03:47,418
Those who poured me wine...

40
00:03:47,617 --> 00:03:50,188
were always those who begged me for more time.

41
00:03:51,457 --> 00:03:52,857
They begged me to help them stay alive.

42
00:03:53,188 --> 00:03:56,258
For 1 more day. For 1 more year.

43
00:03:57,857 --> 00:04:00,327
There's no need to brag about not having any friends.

44
00:04:00,927 --> 00:04:02,598
It's because I don't trust anyone.

45
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:05,198
It sounds like you failed to gain people's trust.

46
00:04:05,198 --> 00:04:06,707
It means I have nothing to protect.

47
00:04:07,568 --> 00:04:09,878
That's what makes me stronger than you.

48
00:04:14,607 --> 00:04:16,517
I'm stronger than you...

49
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,887
because I have someone to protect.

50
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:21,987
Are you sure?

51
00:04:23,418 --> 00:04:25,718
It looks like Ji A's going through something.

52
00:04:26,017 --> 00:04:28,057
My other half has just woken up.

53
00:04:28,188 --> 00:04:29,288
What?

54
00:04:30,057 --> 00:04:31,158
Sit down.

55
00:04:31,728 --> 00:04:33,668
If you leave before I finish this glass of wine,

56
00:04:34,468 --> 00:04:36,237
our deal will no longer be valid.

57
00:04:37,137 --> 00:04:40,068
This is my only chance to take him to the Samdo River.

58
00:04:41,938 --> 00:04:44,938
Should I give up and go to Ji A? Or...

59
00:04:45,677 --> 00:04:46,807
Don't worry.

60
00:04:47,248 --> 00:04:50,318
He shows up when he senses danger.

61
00:04:50,878 --> 00:04:52,177
For example, when I bleed.

62
00:04:53,248 --> 00:04:55,047
He's very protective of himself.

63
00:04:55,617 --> 00:04:56,987
I'm sure everything will be fine.

64
00:04:57,587 --> 00:04:58,918
At least Ji A will be.

65
00:05:08,927 --> 00:05:10,737
This is how we're different.

66
00:05:10,838 --> 00:05:12,908
I'm not sure about that. You also have something...

67
00:05:13,408 --> 00:05:14,908
you must protect at all costs.

68
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:19,208
For example, your other half that lives in Ji A's body.

69
00:05:19,607 --> 00:05:22,918
I heard you'll become pretty insignificant once that dies.

70
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:25,648
It looks like you tried to play smart,

71
00:05:26,047 --> 00:05:27,518
but why did you have to hide something so precious...

72
00:05:28,047 --> 00:05:30,918
inside the woman I love and cause such a nasty mess?

73
00:05:34,028 --> 00:05:35,487
I noticed you took a scale.

74
00:05:35,487 --> 00:05:36,958
- Do you want it back? - Will you give it back?

75
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:37,958
If you give me back Ji A.

76
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,468
The gatekeeper of the Samdo River comes first.

77
00:05:56,918 --> 00:05:58,117
Don't come near me.

78
00:06:01,648 --> 00:06:02,718
Please don't come.

79
00:06:04,617 --> 00:06:05,788
I'm already here.

80
00:06:06,357 --> 00:06:07,627
What will you do?

81
00:06:07,627 --> 00:06:08,788
Will you kill me?

82
00:06:09,057 --> 00:06:12,057
If I die, Ji A will die as well.

83
00:06:15,398 --> 00:06:17,168
- Would you like to shoot me? - Do you think...

84
00:06:18,497 --> 00:06:19,567
I won't be able to?

85
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:21,367
Like you saw earlier, you only get one shot.

86
00:06:21,768 --> 00:06:24,937
If you fail, I'll be the one killing you.

87
00:06:25,877 --> 00:06:28,877
Okay then. I'm going to count to three.

88
00:06:29,718 --> 00:06:30,947
You have until then to decide.

89
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:34,947
- One. - Do you think the three of us...

90
00:06:34,947 --> 00:06:36,218
met by coincidence?

91
00:06:36,218 --> 00:06:37,518
No, I think it was fate.

92
00:06:37,857 --> 00:06:40,158
- Two. - The guy who's after me...

93
00:06:40,228 --> 00:06:41,888
is a lot closer to us than we think.

94
00:06:42,557 --> 00:06:44,997
I'd like to protect you guys...

95
00:06:45,627 --> 00:06:47,728
just like how you both protected me in our past lives.

96
00:06:48,028 --> 00:06:49,127
Three.

97
00:06:50,697 --> 00:06:52,268
Darn it. I knew it.

98
00:06:55,007 --> 00:06:56,138
Ji A!

99
00:06:59,848 --> 00:07:01,648
Come to your senses, you brat.

100
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:07,088
Why do you have so much blood on your hands?

101
00:07:07,447 --> 00:07:08,947
There's blood all over your nice clothes.

102
00:07:13,857 --> 00:07:14,958
Sae Rom?

103
00:07:16,857 --> 00:07:19,997
Yes, it's me. Do you recognize us?

104
00:07:28,338 --> 00:07:29,437
Jae Hwan.

105
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:31,877
I'm okay.

106
00:07:32,177 --> 00:07:33,578
I didn't get hurt at all.

107
00:07:43,418 --> 00:07:44,487
I'm sorry.

108
00:07:45,487 --> 00:07:46,987
I'm so sorry.

109
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:53,197
It's okay. We're all fine. That's what matters.

110
00:07:53,197 --> 00:07:54,297
It's okay.

111
00:07:55,098 --> 00:07:56,228
What am I going to do?

112
00:07:58,668 --> 00:08:00,908
- What am I going to do? - You'll be fine.

113
00:08:01,338 --> 00:08:03,507
How do you plan to attack that old woman who guards the Samdo River?

114
00:08:05,338 --> 00:08:07,208
How much do you know about her?

115
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:08,578
I know she can easily turn...

116
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:11,317
a mountain spirit into a rock with the blink of an eye.

117
00:08:11,778 --> 00:08:14,088
And I heard she can see miles ahead of her.

118
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:16,718
About that power she has to see miles ahead...

119
00:08:18,888 --> 00:08:20,357
How far do you think she can see?

120
00:08:20,788 --> 00:08:22,627
For example, do you think she knows how I look?

121
00:08:24,127 --> 00:08:25,598
It's not a surveillance camera.

122
00:08:25,898 --> 00:08:28,598
She's just able to catch the overall flow of how things go.

123
00:08:29,098 --> 00:08:32,768
For example, she may not be able to hear our conversation.

124
00:08:33,268 --> 00:08:36,007
But she's probably able to tell that we're together right now.

125
00:08:36,007 --> 00:08:38,038
So she doesn't know everything in detail?

126
00:08:40,507 --> 00:08:43,317
If we block her sight, we might be able to win.

127
00:08:44,447 --> 00:08:45,648
How?

128
00:08:52,057 --> 00:08:54,288
This is what you used to make me fall asleep.

129
00:08:55,627 --> 00:08:58,927
Rang only took a small sip, but it worked pretty well.

130
00:08:58,927 --> 00:09:00,697
Do you think she'll drink this?

131
00:09:01,898 --> 00:09:03,237
She might.

132
00:09:04,237 --> 00:09:07,567
That is, if we use the one person she trusts.

133
00:09:07,807 --> 00:09:08,908
Who's that?

134
00:09:10,677 --> 00:09:11,807
Hyeonuiong.

135
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:19,578
I heard he does everything his wife tells him to do.

136
00:09:19,788 --> 00:09:20,888
Not anymore.

137
00:09:22,118 --> 00:09:25,557
He disobeyed her and saved Ji A. That's good enough to prove that.

138
00:09:33,097 --> 00:09:36,168
So he's going to put her to sleep before we get there?

139
00:09:38,398 --> 00:09:39,768
Once she falls asleep,

140
00:09:40,437 --> 00:09:41,508
you can take care of her.

141
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:43,337
- When are we going to do this? - Tomorrow.

142
00:09:44,878 --> 00:09:46,177
Meet me there at noon.

143
00:09:46,807 --> 00:09:47,977
Once it's all done,

144
00:09:48,347 --> 00:09:51,047
you gain control over the Samdo River as we promised,

145
00:09:51,217 --> 00:09:54,018
and your ill-fated relationship with me and Ji A will end there.

146
00:09:57,087 --> 00:09:58,158
Okay.

147
00:10:03,697 --> 00:10:04,957
I wonder why I'm so worried.

148
00:10:05,697 --> 00:10:07,927
Things are going a lot smoother than I thought.

149
00:10:11,837 --> 00:10:14,567
No, what matters is that he took the bait.

150
00:10:15,268 --> 00:10:18,408
I just need to take him to the Samdo River.

151
00:10:20,977 --> 00:10:23,278
Didn't they once have a son?

152
00:10:28,988 --> 00:10:30,258
How do you know that?

153
00:10:30,488 --> 00:10:32,918
I just know.

154
00:10:41,168 --> 00:10:43,567
How do you think this story will end?

155
00:10:48,307 --> 00:10:49,707
It's going to be a happy ending no matter what.

156
00:11:45,957 --> 00:11:47,498
Our station president came.

157
00:11:48,467 --> 00:11:51,138
He had the same disease as Sae Rom.

158
00:11:52,138 --> 00:11:55,868
He said he could live if he killed me.

159
00:11:57,638 --> 00:11:58,707
Where is he?

160
00:11:59,577 --> 00:12:00,677
He's dead.

161
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:03,317
I shot him.

162
00:12:05,177 --> 00:12:07,047
I turned into Imoogi, and...

163
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:16,227
He defied death and lived for centuries.

164
00:12:17,927 --> 00:12:21,128
He wouldn't have made it past today even if you hadn't shot him.

165
00:12:21,398 --> 00:12:23,268
I almost killed Jae Hwan too.

166
00:12:25,898 --> 00:12:28,108
I finally came to my senses, but...

167
00:12:36,717 --> 00:12:38,878
You did well. You did.

168
00:12:38,947 --> 00:12:40,347
I'm so scared.

169
00:12:40,817 --> 00:12:42,187
It's almost over.

170
00:12:45,518 --> 00:12:47,057
It'll be over tomorrow.

171
00:12:53,097 --> 00:12:54,498
Don't you need to urinate?

172
00:12:54,898 --> 00:12:57,238
I don't do things like that much.

173
00:12:58,597 --> 00:13:01,307
You're lying in bed in my place of business.

174
00:13:01,368 --> 00:13:03,307
Why are you being shy?

175
00:13:06,307 --> 00:13:09,477
Why are you so good to me?

176
00:13:09,947 --> 00:13:12,148
You even closed the restaurant because of me.

177
00:13:12,217 --> 00:13:15,018
People come and go in your life. That's how it is.

178
00:13:15,488 --> 00:13:18,158
You said you lost your husband a long time ago, right?

179
00:13:18,957 --> 00:13:22,858
What was your husband like?

180
00:13:24,658 --> 00:13:28,567
Even if we shared one small fish together,

181
00:13:28,927 --> 00:13:31,898
he'd debone it and give me some first.

182
00:13:32,297 --> 00:13:34,408
Once, it was the middle of winter.

183
00:13:35,268 --> 00:13:37,937
I said I wanted honey-filled rice cakes,

184
00:13:38,837 --> 00:13:41,778
and he climbed over a snowy hill just to get them for me.

185
00:13:43,418 --> 00:13:45,878
He could've just called a delivery service.

186
00:13:45,947 --> 00:13:47,988
Why did he do that? He's a bit over the top.

187
00:13:48,748 --> 00:13:49,947
What about you?

188
00:13:50,988 --> 00:13:53,388
Why do you keep coming to me?

189
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,957
Whenever I eat your food,

190
00:13:57,727 --> 00:13:59,158
my heart...

191
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,927
gets all tickly.

192
00:14:02,197 --> 00:14:05,567
It feels very familiar, and it feels like it's something...

193
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,008
I've missed.

194
00:14:11,538 --> 00:14:14,347
How many souls crossed over the river last night because of Imoogi?

195
00:14:15,908 --> 00:14:17,177
903?

196
00:14:19,717 --> 00:14:23,587
Call in the emergency staff, and tell them to hang on one more night.

197
00:14:34,197 --> 00:14:35,567
Honey!

198
00:14:53,918 --> 00:14:55,447
For when my honey's eyes are tired.

199
00:14:55,717 --> 00:14:57,587
To soothe my honey's temper.

200
00:14:57,817 --> 00:15:00,057
It's good for when my honey has a stomachache.

201
00:15:04,758 --> 00:15:06,727
Is something wrong?

202
00:15:08,467 --> 00:15:10,197
Granny's arthritis medicine...

203
00:15:10,768 --> 00:15:12,768
has probably run out now.

204
00:15:14,008 --> 00:15:16,467
Whatever. I don't care. Whatever.

205
00:15:17,508 --> 00:15:18,908
Go home.

206
00:15:18,977 --> 00:15:21,707
You've rebelled long enough.

207
00:15:21,778 --> 00:15:23,947
- Forget it. - You know you'll regret it.

208
00:15:25,977 --> 00:15:27,047
I'm already regretting it.

209
00:15:27,288 --> 00:15:29,988
Why did I think I could change her?

210
00:15:31,118 --> 00:15:33,118
Why couldn't I leave her when I lost my son?

211
00:15:33,187 --> 00:15:35,488
- Because you loved her... - I did.

212
00:15:36,158 --> 00:15:37,557
I thought it was love.

213
00:15:38,158 --> 00:15:41,827
Our personalities, preferences... We had nothing in common.

214
00:15:42,227 --> 00:15:44,668
We couldn't even share a plate of tteokbokki together.

215
00:15:44,738 --> 00:15:48,268
I always got mild, and she got the spiciest.

216
00:15:48,337 --> 00:15:50,408
Couldn't you split a medium spicy?

217
00:15:51,108 --> 00:15:53,108
That's married life.

218
00:15:53,378 --> 00:15:55,748
We were just too different.

219
00:15:58,518 --> 00:16:00,947
So? Will you just watch?

220
00:16:01,888 --> 00:16:03,587
You said Yeon may die...

221
00:16:04,388 --> 00:16:06,158
in that lady's place.

222
00:16:06,217 --> 00:16:08,988
There's no other reason for Granny to keep her alive.

223
00:16:09,057 --> 00:16:11,758
- Stop him. - If he would listen to me,

224
00:16:11,927 --> 00:16:14,028
things wouldn't have come this far.

225
00:16:14,097 --> 00:16:15,668
But we can't...

226
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:19,067
lose Yeon like this.

227
00:16:27,378 --> 00:16:29,748
(Yeon)

228
00:16:35,947 --> 00:16:37,158
Hey, what's up?

229
00:16:37,258 --> 00:16:38,518
Let's meet.

230
00:16:38,618 --> 00:16:41,028
Say it over the phone. I'm ready to hear it.

231
00:16:41,258 --> 00:16:42,557
It's too long to say it over the phone.

232
00:16:43,028 --> 00:16:44,957
I just met with Imoogi.

233
00:16:48,268 --> 00:16:49,368
You did?

234
00:16:49,697 --> 00:16:50,697
Okay.

235
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:55,868
What's with that reaction?

236
00:16:56,768 --> 00:16:59,477
Is that girl dead or alive?

237
00:17:13,888 --> 00:17:15,457
What do you mean?

238
00:17:15,658 --> 00:17:17,557
Why would you swallow his scale?

239
00:17:19,528 --> 00:17:23,128
Because if I do, Imoogi, who's inside of Ji A,

240
00:17:23,937 --> 00:17:25,498
will transfer over to me.

241
00:17:27,638 --> 00:17:29,738
- And then? - I'll take him with me...

242
00:17:30,837 --> 00:17:32,408
and jump into the Samdo River.

243
00:17:34,748 --> 00:17:37,148
No. Definitely not.

244
00:17:40,847 --> 00:17:43,587
I'm sure there's another way.

245
00:17:45,187 --> 00:17:46,518
It isn't...

246
00:17:47,988 --> 00:17:49,187
just Ji A.

247
00:17:49,457 --> 00:17:50,628
Countless lives being lost...

248
00:17:50,697 --> 00:17:52,858
because of this plague are at stake as well.

249
00:17:53,668 --> 00:17:56,497
I thought about every possibility available,

250
00:18:00,668 --> 00:18:03,777
and this is the only way to catch him.

251
00:18:05,908 --> 00:18:07,048
Then I'll do it.

252
00:18:07,848 --> 00:18:10,878
I'll swallow his scale and jump into the Samdo River.

253
00:18:12,017 --> 00:18:13,648
You can't handle Imoogi.

254
00:18:15,848 --> 00:18:16,918
Don't do it.

255
00:18:18,487 --> 00:18:21,058
Please, don't do it. You can't even save your soul then.

256
00:18:21,927 --> 00:18:24,128
You can't be reincarnated or anything.

257
00:18:25,858 --> 00:18:27,427
- I know. - Then please!

258
00:18:27,497 --> 00:18:29,467
Can you not say you're going to die?

259
00:18:39,007 --> 00:18:40,277
Shin Ju.

260
00:18:48,548 --> 00:18:49,548
You must...

261
00:18:52,487 --> 00:18:54,287
understand me.

262
00:18:57,027 --> 00:18:59,697
I'm telling you everything because it's you.

263
00:19:06,568 --> 00:19:07,908
You're so mean.

264
00:19:08,467 --> 00:19:11,037
You're so mean to me.

265
00:19:24,487 --> 00:19:25,757
What brings you here?

266
00:19:25,888 --> 00:19:27,858
Thanks for the gift.

267
00:19:28,658 --> 00:19:31,358
- The gift? - You sent our president to me.

268
00:19:32,697 --> 00:19:35,168
Why didn't you tell Yeon if you knew?

269
00:19:35,368 --> 00:19:36,767
Because I would've done the same.

270
00:19:36,898 --> 00:19:39,598
If I were you, I would've told Yeon long ago.

271
00:19:39,668 --> 00:19:42,868
I did not, and I don't plan to.

272
00:19:43,437 --> 00:19:44,477
Why not?

273
00:19:45,138 --> 00:19:46,737
Because Yeon cherishes you.

274
00:19:47,677 --> 00:19:51,048
Because he'll be sad if he loses you.

275
00:19:56,548 --> 00:19:58,818
Do you even know what it means...

276
00:19:59,687 --> 00:20:01,158
for Yeon to team up with Imoogi?

277
00:20:01,787 --> 00:20:04,898
- What does it mean? - He plans to save you and die.

278
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:07,368
Because of you,

279
00:20:08,527 --> 00:20:09,598
Yeon will die.

280
00:20:11,068 --> 00:20:14,338
Yeon is planning to die in order to save me?

281
00:20:14,408 --> 00:20:15,767
Isn't it obvious?

282
00:20:17,737 --> 00:20:19,138
Which gets me to my point...

283
00:20:21,447 --> 00:20:24,277
Give me one reason why I shouldn't kill you...

284
00:20:25,118 --> 00:20:26,277
here and now.

285
00:20:29,487 --> 00:20:32,517
If it's your wish, I won't stop you.

286
00:20:33,187 --> 00:20:34,927
But I don't want to encourage it.

287
00:20:35,358 --> 00:20:37,227
You'll either die or get hurt.

288
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,328
Someone else just tried it.

289
00:20:44,467 --> 00:20:46,068
I'll be straightforward with you.

290
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:48,138
I don't intend to die.

291
00:20:49,007 --> 00:20:50,138
At least not yet.

292
00:20:50,578 --> 00:20:51,677
"Not yet"?

293
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,378
If by chance, I hurt Yeon,

294
00:21:01,088 --> 00:21:02,747
I will kill myself.

295
00:21:03,487 --> 00:21:06,287
If by chance, I fail,

296
00:21:06,888 --> 00:21:07,927
you kill me.

297
00:21:11,158 --> 00:21:12,457
Yeon won't be able to kill me.

298
00:21:13,868 --> 00:21:14,997
Do you mean it?

299
00:21:18,138 --> 00:21:20,737
Unfortunately, we share a common goal.

300
00:21:21,368 --> 00:21:22,767
Protecting Yeon.

301
00:21:24,638 --> 00:21:27,947
If you want to save your brother, we need a truce for now.

302
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:31,378
Okay?

303
00:21:43,858 --> 00:21:44,997
Deal.

304
00:21:47,997 --> 00:21:49,497
What do you need me to do then?

305
00:21:53,467 --> 00:21:55,408
Don't get caught up in this battle,

306
00:21:57,007 --> 00:21:58,507
stay alive,

307
00:22:00,477 --> 00:22:01,707
and protect Ji A.

308
00:22:04,848 --> 00:22:06,017
In my place,

309
00:22:06,947 --> 00:22:08,118
you'll look after her.

310
00:22:08,388 --> 00:22:09,648
I will.

311
00:22:15,457 --> 00:22:16,558
And if Rang...

312
00:22:17,598 --> 00:22:20,257
suffers a heartbreak and acts out again,

313
00:22:23,767 --> 00:22:25,068
you'll give him an earful.

314
00:22:25,898 --> 00:22:27,068
Tell him to get his act together.

315
00:22:28,507 --> 00:22:30,037
I will do that until his ears fall off.

316
00:22:34,148 --> 00:22:36,848
Start a family with the necklace thief.

317
00:22:38,777 --> 00:22:41,487
Consider this as a pre-wedding gift.

318
00:22:42,918 --> 00:22:44,918
It's a new apartment in your name.

319
00:22:46,318 --> 00:22:48,858
Thank you for putting up with my temper.

320
00:22:51,697 --> 00:22:52,757
Mr. Lee...

321
00:22:55,427 --> 00:22:56,868
Thanking you for all your troubles...

322
00:22:57,898 --> 00:22:59,398
That I won't do.

323
00:23:01,237 --> 00:23:03,668
I made up for it by paying for your expenses.

324
00:23:03,878 --> 00:23:04,937
Mr. Lee,

325
00:23:08,378 --> 00:23:10,048
may I ask you one thing?

326
00:23:11,277 --> 00:23:14,418
When I was being chased by the mountain spirit I served,

327
00:23:14,848 --> 00:23:16,618
why did you save me?

328
00:23:18,388 --> 00:23:19,457
For payback.

329
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:24,798
I had bibim noodles with your mountain spirit once...

330
00:23:25,158 --> 00:23:28,997
and he had the audacity to steal my boiled egg.

331
00:23:29,068 --> 00:23:30,997
That's why you saved me?

332
00:23:30,997 --> 00:23:33,138
It wasn't for nothing, you know. You see,

333
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:36,338
I always save my boiled egg to enjoy it at the very end.

334
00:24:18,017 --> 00:24:19,078
What's the meaning of this?

335
00:24:20,348 --> 00:24:22,648
Why should a bowl of naengmyeon carry meaning?

336
00:24:23,017 --> 00:24:24,818
Why are you treating me to this all of a sudden?

337
00:24:24,957 --> 00:24:27,058
You're buying, actually. I skipped lunch today.

338
00:24:28,027 --> 00:24:30,757
As if I don't know how you think.

339
00:24:31,257 --> 00:24:33,358
Can we just eat without this giving me indigestion?

340
00:24:42,568 --> 00:24:45,177
It's true that you only add mustard and no vinegar.

341
00:24:45,838 --> 00:24:47,007
What?

342
00:24:47,007 --> 00:24:49,477
Ki Yu Ri. That's what she said.

343
00:24:50,078 --> 00:24:52,517
You only add mustard in your naengmyeon.

344
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:54,687
Did she say that?

345
00:24:54,947 --> 00:24:57,957
One needs to be attentive to know that, you know.

346
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:01,727
Well, I saved her life.

347
00:25:01,987 --> 00:25:03,687
If I hadn't saved her, she would've starved...

348
00:25:03,687 --> 00:25:05,858
or been beaten to death at the zoo.

349
00:25:08,927 --> 00:25:10,767
What's with that kid at your house though?

350
00:25:11,197 --> 00:25:13,798
It's Geomdoong, my dog from my past life.

351
00:25:16,868 --> 00:25:19,977
I don't care if he was your dog back then.

352
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:22,808
You can't take him away from his current parents like that.

353
00:25:22,808 --> 00:25:26,217
His stepfather has been beating him, and that made me angry.

354
00:25:29,447 --> 00:25:31,187
- Why are you laughing? - It's funny, that's all.

355
00:25:31,358 --> 00:25:34,187
For someone who's been causing mayhem like the Joker,

356
00:25:34,687 --> 00:25:36,457
it's funny to know that you've been doing good deeds too.

357
00:25:36,457 --> 00:25:38,697
- Shut it. - Look at you all grown up now.

358
00:25:39,158 --> 00:25:40,328
Bedwetter.

359
00:25:41,267 --> 00:25:42,368
I'll kill you, you know.

360
00:25:50,068 --> 00:25:51,277
Give me your egg if you're not going to eat it.

361
00:26:12,658 --> 00:26:14,967
You don't have to look overtly unhappy, you know.

362
00:26:14,967 --> 00:26:16,168
I hate being here with you.

363
00:26:16,398 --> 00:26:17,537
I want to go home.

364
00:26:18,098 --> 00:26:19,197
Home?

365
00:26:20,237 --> 00:26:21,808
As if you have a home to go back to.

366
00:26:22,408 --> 00:26:24,677
You attacked Lee Rang with your own hands...

367
00:26:24,878 --> 00:26:27,037
and Shin Ju ended the relationship with you yesterday.

368
00:26:27,447 --> 00:26:29,177
No one will want you back.

369
00:26:29,177 --> 00:26:31,548
You're wrong. Mr. Lee will be waiting for me.

370
00:26:32,818 --> 00:26:33,918
Shin Ju too.

371
00:26:33,918 --> 00:26:36,348
Actually, this is where you belong.

372
00:26:37,517 --> 00:26:39,418
You've been beaten by a human, haven't you?

373
00:26:39,787 --> 00:26:42,828
For a long time too until your soul ended up ragged.

374
00:26:43,757 --> 00:26:45,257
I see the darkness in you.

375
00:26:48,568 --> 00:26:50,128
Don't read people like that.

376
00:26:50,668 --> 00:26:52,398
It's what makes you freakier.

377
00:26:53,767 --> 00:26:55,338
A thing like you...

378
00:26:55,638 --> 00:26:59,177
will only spread misfortune to Lee Rang or Shin Ju.

379
00:26:59,908 --> 00:27:01,007
Like me.

380
00:27:01,777 --> 00:27:04,177
So don't bother with the wishful thinking.

381
00:27:05,947 --> 00:27:07,418
No one will come to save you.

382
00:27:10,888 --> 00:27:12,058
I speak from experience.

383
00:27:18,828 --> 00:27:20,257
Is that naengmyeon that good?

384
00:27:20,257 --> 00:27:21,668
At least it tastes good.

385
00:27:21,868 --> 00:27:23,427
I still don't get what you see in that girl.

386
00:27:23,628 --> 00:27:26,168
For what reason are you willing to give up your life for her?

387
00:27:30,908 --> 00:27:32,977
She saved me in my past life.

388
00:27:33,437 --> 00:27:34,977
She died for me.

389
00:27:36,308 --> 00:27:37,578
If I don't stop her,

390
00:27:38,348 --> 00:27:40,118
she'll give up her own life...

391
00:27:41,017 --> 00:27:42,517
to save mine again.

392
00:27:45,118 --> 00:27:47,058
She always keeps her promises, you see.

393
00:27:47,158 --> 00:27:49,027
Then let her save you.

394
00:27:49,027 --> 00:27:50,358
That's what she wants.

395
00:27:50,628 --> 00:27:51,727
No way.

396
00:27:52,427 --> 00:27:55,027
My pride can't handle her saving me twice.

397
00:27:55,267 --> 00:27:56,328
Crazy jerk.

398
00:27:56,527 --> 00:27:59,598
So? You'll die instead of her?

399
00:28:01,668 --> 00:28:04,408
Rang, join me tomorrow.

400
00:28:05,707 --> 00:28:07,608
- Where? - To Samdo River.

401
00:28:08,148 --> 00:28:09,247
To end Imoogi.

402
00:28:10,578 --> 00:28:13,078
I need you there to prevent...

403
00:28:13,447 --> 00:28:14,618
any unexpected things from happening.

404
00:28:14,618 --> 00:28:15,848
What are you planning?

405
00:28:15,947 --> 00:28:17,717
There's no need to know the details.

406
00:28:18,757 --> 00:28:21,328
Just be there to help things go as planned.

407
00:28:23,757 --> 00:28:24,858
I'll think about it.

408
00:28:25,298 --> 00:28:28,798
Hey, I saved your life twice, you know.

409
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:31,298
- There's no need to be calculative. - I'm glad you said that.

410
00:28:31,437 --> 00:28:33,467
Is that all the reaction you can give to your brother?

411
00:28:33,467 --> 00:28:36,207
Shouldn't you shed a tear when I could actually die?

412
00:28:36,267 --> 00:28:37,338
You won't though.

413
00:28:38,237 --> 00:28:39,408
It's not like you're mortal.

414
00:28:42,808 --> 00:28:44,548
A nine-tailed fox can't die so easily.

415
00:28:48,618 --> 00:28:49,918
The clear sky sure is nice.

416
00:28:50,487 --> 00:28:52,888
It won't be a bad day for the world to end.

417
00:28:53,058 --> 00:28:55,187
What are you and Mr. Lee planning to do?

418
00:28:56,088 --> 00:28:57,257
Didn't you hear everything...

419
00:28:57,757 --> 00:28:59,058
that we discussed?

420
00:28:59,898 --> 00:29:02,598
So you'll really end up being an almighty?

421
00:29:04,027 --> 00:29:05,168
What comes afterwards, then?

422
00:29:05,168 --> 00:29:06,467
I'll rule the world...

423
00:29:07,298 --> 00:29:08,668
and take Ji A for myself.

424
00:29:10,007 --> 00:29:11,578
That's not what you promised!

425
00:29:11,578 --> 00:29:13,378
What he requested can't be granted.

426
00:29:14,037 --> 00:29:15,408
I'm sure Lee Yeon feels the same way.

427
00:29:16,378 --> 00:29:19,747
That's why you should accompany me to Samdo River.

428
00:29:20,177 --> 00:29:21,217
Why should I go there?

429
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:24,858
Just in case he doesn't come alone. I'll need you to keep them occupied.

430
00:29:25,088 --> 00:29:28,027
- What if I don't want to? - I wasn't asking for your opinion.

431
00:29:31,497 --> 00:29:33,798
Maybe I should call Lee Rang and Shin Ju.

432
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,967
It'll be over if I suggest suicide.

433
00:29:37,368 --> 00:29:38,668
You know you can't disobey me.

434
00:29:38,868 --> 00:29:40,568
Just kill me instead, darn it!

435
00:29:43,068 --> 00:29:45,108
That's not how things work.

436
00:29:45,338 --> 00:29:46,537
If I kill you,

437
00:29:47,947 --> 00:29:50,148
they won't get to see you in despair.

438
00:30:13,037 --> 00:30:14,537
What brings you here?

439
00:30:18,138 --> 00:30:21,348
I may only be a mere cook,

440
00:30:23,477 --> 00:30:27,048
but I can't sit back and watch Mr. Lee Yeon die.

441
00:30:28,947 --> 00:30:30,487
Just sit back...

442
00:30:31,017 --> 00:30:32,158
and watch.

443
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:34,588
This isn't something you can prevent.

444
00:30:34,588 --> 00:30:36,027
But I can't.

445
00:30:38,058 --> 00:30:39,128
What?

446
00:30:46,368 --> 00:30:47,668
Snail Bride,

447
00:30:50,068 --> 00:30:51,507
where are you right now?

448
00:30:51,507 --> 00:30:54,808
The bridge between the Afterlife and the Living Realm.

449
00:30:55,707 --> 00:30:57,177
Tell me who I am.

450
00:30:57,177 --> 00:30:59,677
The Lady of Samdo River.

451
00:31:00,517 --> 00:31:01,588
Then,

452
00:31:02,017 --> 00:31:05,558
you must be aware that you just crossed the line.

453
00:31:05,618 --> 00:31:06,818
I'm aware of that.

454
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:11,997
However, you're not just the Lady of Samdo River.

455
00:31:12,358 --> 00:31:14,027
You're also one's wife,

456
00:31:14,467 --> 00:31:17,027
one's mother, and one's friend.

457
00:31:17,227 --> 00:31:20,237
You're not Bok Gil's mother or my wife.

458
00:31:21,108 --> 00:31:22,638
Just the watchwoman of Samdo River.

459
00:31:23,267 --> 00:31:24,378
You're wrong.

460
00:31:27,108 --> 00:31:28,378
Never have I been...

461
00:31:29,308 --> 00:31:32,818
someone's wife, son, or friend.

462
00:31:39,158 --> 00:31:40,388
Will you be okay...

463
00:31:41,487 --> 00:31:42,828
even after Yeon dies?

464
00:31:43,227 --> 00:31:45,927
- What? - Forget about fate.

465
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:48,398
I'm asking about how you'll feel.

466
00:31:49,427 --> 00:31:50,967
For a very long time,

467
00:31:51,537 --> 00:31:53,467
Yeon trusted and relied on you.

468
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:57,908
It's probably because you cared for him that much.

469
00:31:59,608 --> 00:32:00,937
And that's because...

470
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:04,078
he reminded you of your late son.

471
00:32:04,378 --> 00:32:06,548
Did my husband tell you that?

472
00:32:07,447 --> 00:32:10,348
Then he must've also told you what I did...

473
00:32:10,418 --> 00:32:12,618
to my one and only son.

474
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:15,888
My son...

475
00:32:16,858 --> 00:32:19,757
also stood there and begged me just like Yeon.

476
00:32:20,328 --> 00:32:22,798
He asked me to let his wife live.

477
00:32:23,598 --> 00:32:26,737
However, I refused to help my son.

478
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:28,207
And that's why...

479
00:32:28,908 --> 00:32:31,007
you've been beating yourself up all these years.

480
00:32:38,777 --> 00:32:40,277
How dare you?

481
00:32:40,348 --> 00:32:43,318
I'm sorry if I crossed the line. But...

482
00:32:43,388 --> 00:32:45,118
Say one more word,

483
00:32:45,787 --> 00:32:48,727
and I'll make sure you'll never be able to cook again.

484
00:32:53,058 --> 00:32:55,168
(Glucosamine)

485
00:32:57,298 --> 00:32:58,868
I was told to give you this.

486
00:33:00,338 --> 00:33:01,408
Please...

487
00:33:02,937 --> 00:33:05,537
don't give up on Yeon or your husband.

488
00:33:18,118 --> 00:33:21,287
(Glucosamine)

489
00:33:25,158 --> 00:33:26,298
Where are we off to this time?

490
00:33:27,427 --> 00:33:28,868
You don't need to come.

491
00:33:28,868 --> 00:33:30,267
I'll tell you what you need to do once I'm back.

492
00:33:34,197 --> 00:33:36,668
What? You said that to Yu Ri?

493
00:33:37,338 --> 00:33:38,437
She used you?

494
00:33:38,578 --> 00:33:39,608
It was a mistake.

495
00:33:40,037 --> 00:33:42,648
Yu Ri told me she didn't care whether those people died or not.

496
00:33:42,707 --> 00:33:44,777
They're Ji A's parents, so why would she care?

497
00:33:45,548 --> 00:33:48,148
You crazy punk. How dare you treat Yu Ri that way?

498
00:33:48,217 --> 00:33:50,447
She's already risking her life because of me.

499
00:33:54,628 --> 00:33:56,088
I regret what I said to her.

500
00:33:56,828 --> 00:33:59,158
But I don't know how to reach her, and there's no way to apologize.

501
00:33:59,227 --> 00:34:00,398
You're doomed now.

502
00:34:00,898 --> 00:34:03,828
She holds a really bad grudge.

503
00:34:04,937 --> 00:34:06,568
Can you talk to her...

504
00:34:06,668 --> 00:34:08,068
The same goes for me.

505
00:34:08,638 --> 00:34:10,767
I will never approve of you and Yu Ri.

506
00:34:14,108 --> 00:34:17,378
Do you think she'll be able to come back safely?

507
00:34:19,618 --> 00:34:21,388
We must do something. Let's go.

508
00:34:22,818 --> 00:34:23,848
Where?

509
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,189
Yu Ri, it's me.

510
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:03,459
Your car's outside, so I'm guessing you're there.

511
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:06,399
I don't care if he's with you, so just listen.

512
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:09,569
You're in for some trouble once you return home.

513
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:12,169
Who said you could go live with him?

514
00:35:17,439 --> 00:35:20,140
Things are so uncomfortable without you.

515
00:35:20,479 --> 00:35:22,049
No one's around to buy me naengmyeon.

516
00:35:22,879 --> 00:35:25,720
And the little kid put stickers all over me. He drives me nuts.

517
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,180
You came all the way here to say that?

518
00:35:28,089 --> 00:35:29,350
What if she's not listening?

519
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,359
- Should we just barge in? - No.

520
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:32,959
Yeon will get furious if he finds out.

521
00:35:34,529 --> 00:35:35,859
Then let me say something as well.

522
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:38,200
Yu Ri, don't ever forgive him.

523
00:35:41,669 --> 00:35:42,729
Yu Ri.

524
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:45,740
I'll save my apology for later.

525
00:35:46,569 --> 00:35:47,970
I hope you return safely.

526
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:51,339
Don't listen to a word he says.

527
00:35:51,879 --> 00:35:53,379
Just make sure you stay safe.

528
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,779
You see, I was...

529
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:56,810
planning on proposing to you...

530
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:58,279
- once you returned. - Stop it.

531
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:59,350
What?

532
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:03,120
Yu Ri.

533
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:05,620
I'll save you.

534
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,689
Just hang in there until tomorrow.

535
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:13,459
- I'll also protect... - That's enough. Let's go.

536
00:36:13,529 --> 00:36:15,129
No, wait.

537
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:58,979
Guess who.

538
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,350
I can tell who you are just by looking at these hands.

539
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:06,319
What if it's someone else pretending to be me?

540
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:10,390
Then my heart wouldn't be beating so fast like right now.

541
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,959
I'm impressed by your lines.

542
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,700
Are you sure you stayed single for 600 years?

543
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,999
Yes, of course.

544
00:37:21,399 --> 00:37:23,399
I only have eyes for you.

545
00:37:23,999 --> 00:37:24,999
You're all I see.

546
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:29,970
What are we doing today?

547
00:37:30,439 --> 00:37:33,310
Today, we're going to go on a date just like a normal couple.

548
00:37:33,439 --> 00:37:34,439
You can look forward to it.

549
00:37:36,609 --> 00:37:39,549
This is what normal couples do. I'll walk by the road.

550
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,430
Why a claw crane?

551
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,999
I've always wanted to do this.

552
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:58,200
I know I'm rich enough to buy this entire arcade.

553
00:37:58,339 --> 00:38:01,470
But I want to give you something that shows my effort.

554
00:38:03,339 --> 00:38:04,470
Watch.

555
00:38:04,979 --> 00:38:08,379
Don't fight the machine. You need to go along with it.

556
00:38:09,279 --> 00:38:10,410
Like this.

557
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,830
This is so cute.

558
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:23,629
- Let's try one more time. - Try it again.

559
00:38:23,689 --> 00:38:24,700
Help.

560
00:38:26,299 --> 00:38:27,999
Like this. There.

561
00:38:28,069 --> 00:38:29,100
Should I press the button?

562
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,040
It's working.

563
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:38,979
Ta-da.

564
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,089
It's not going in.

565
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:59,100
No, no. Wait.

566
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:01,299
- Hold the ball like this. - Let go.

567
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:03,600
This is a fight between me and this machine.

568
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:14,709
Move. Move.

569
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,089
How do you like your mint chocolate?

570
00:39:31,799 --> 00:39:33,029
It's nice and fresh.

571
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:35,700
It's as if I have an entire forest in my mouth.

572
00:39:36,729 --> 00:39:37,870
How do you like your vanilla?

573
00:39:40,939 --> 00:39:42,169
It's sweet.

574
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,510
This tastes like honey too.

575
00:39:47,379 --> 00:39:48,510
Why don't we switch?

576
00:39:49,979 --> 00:39:51,450
How about we mix it instead?

577
00:40:06,812 --> 00:40:11,322
I think I love you a lot.

578
00:40:12,092 --> 00:40:14,022
I've lived for so long.

579
00:40:15,322 --> 00:40:18,931
And I have a vague memory of all the people I've met.

580
00:40:19,931 --> 00:40:23,232
But I remember every single moment I spent with you.

581
00:40:26,232 --> 00:40:27,471
Don't forget me.

582
00:40:28,641 --> 00:40:29,772
Ever.

583
00:40:35,882 --> 00:40:37,681
How could I forget this face?

584
00:40:42,152 --> 00:40:44,051
I love you, Yeon.

585
00:41:13,493 --> 00:41:14,593
Was that it?

586
00:41:16,111 --> 00:41:18,841
Did you not leave me?

587
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:22,750
Did I abandon you?

588
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:28,350
Is that why I ended up this way?

589
00:41:30,051 --> 00:41:34,120
I swore over and over that I wouldn't forgive you.

590
00:41:35,991 --> 00:41:37,261
But it turns out...

591
00:41:39,161 --> 00:41:42,931
I couldn't forgive myself.

592
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,241
What kind...

593
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:51,911
of mom was I?

594
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,781
What did you wish?

595
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,221
That you'll be safe.

596
00:42:35,991 --> 00:42:38,390
That you won't get hurt, sick...

597
00:42:39,761 --> 00:42:40,890
or cry.

598
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:44,931
How selfish.

599
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:49,600
And that you could forget everything...

600
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,640
if something beyond our control happens.

601
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:58,810
No. I'll wait for you.

602
00:43:01,681 --> 00:43:03,281
Just as you waited for me.

603
00:43:09,991 --> 00:43:11,290
No, don't.

604
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,460
A human being's life is too short.

605
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,060
What did you wish?

606
00:43:18,431 --> 00:43:21,301
I wished that a very kind deity exists...

607
00:43:21,971 --> 00:43:24,401
somewhere in this world,

608
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:28,511
and prayed for something like a miracle.

609
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,241
And I wished...

610
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,750
the deity to save us both.

611
00:43:57,071 --> 00:43:58,230
Hi, Granny.

612
00:44:01,401 --> 00:44:03,310
What? Now?

613
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:11,920
What did you mean?

614
00:44:15,721 --> 00:44:18,520
I've been smoking for very long.

615
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:25,091
There were only two people who nagged me to quit.

616
00:44:26,531 --> 00:44:29,670
- You, and... - And the other was your son.

617
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:33,701
He was the kindest kid.

618
00:44:34,741 --> 00:44:35,870
But...

619
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:40,810
when his wife died, he never spoke again.

620
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,750
I wish he would've just resented me openly.

621
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:49,120
And then he jumped into the Samdo River?

622
00:44:49,491 --> 00:44:52,620
He left the shoes I made him nicely on the riverbank.

623
00:44:53,361 --> 00:44:54,620
That jerk.

624
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:56,960
As if he wanted me to see them.

625
00:44:57,890 --> 00:45:00,060
As if to say he wouldn't forgive me even after he died.

626
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:02,701
You're wrong.

627
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:07,040
He was so sad when he was going to meet his dead wife,

628
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:11,611
but he didn't want the shoes to get wet.

629
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:15,181
I'm an expert in that field.

630
00:45:19,651 --> 00:45:21,420
I'm planning to quit smoking.

631
00:45:22,451 --> 00:45:23,651
Do you mean it this time?

632
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:28,790
I've lived long enough. I want to try something different.

633
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:31,890
What do you mean?

634
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:34,600
I'm saying there's a way to put an end to this...

635
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:37,870
without either you or that girl dying.

636
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:41,241
What is it?

637
00:45:46,881 --> 00:45:48,241
Good work everyone.

638
00:45:49,151 --> 00:45:50,611
- Thank you. - Thank you.

639
00:45:50,951 --> 00:45:52,451
Get home safely.

640
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,080
- Thank you. - Thank you.

641
00:45:55,151 --> 00:45:56,520
- Good night - Good night.

642
00:45:58,721 --> 00:45:59,821
Let's go.

643
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:05,060
(Staff Only Admittance)

644
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,350
When Imoogi comes here tomorrow,

645
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,350
stab Ji A with this sword.

646
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:37,431
Stab her enough to kill her.

647
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,060
- What? - When she's almost dead,

648
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,870
Imoogi's other half in Ji A's body will try to escape her body...

649
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:44,830
before she dies.

650
00:46:45,201 --> 00:46:47,600
- What about the scale? - Don't use it.

651
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:50,071
Let him transfer into Imoogi's body.

652
00:46:50,741 --> 00:46:52,810
Once the divided Imoogi becomes one,

653
00:46:53,781 --> 00:46:55,551
I'll turn it into stone.

654
00:46:56,651 --> 00:47:01,051
But what if Ji A ends up really dying?

655
00:47:03,651 --> 00:47:04,890
I'll save her.

656
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:11,390
I'll be punished as well for breaking a taboo.

657
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:13,960
Granny.

658
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:19,270
Don't say anything sappy, and bring them here on time.

659
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:21,770
Both her and Imoogi.

660
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:29,310
You know, I knew from the start that you weren't all bad.

661
00:47:32,151 --> 00:47:33,350
Get off of me, kid.

662
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:02,681
I enjoyed the performance.

663
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:04,951
Thank you.

664
00:48:05,951 --> 00:48:07,721
I see you're not human either.

665
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:10,420
You've got a sharp eye.

666
00:48:12,861 --> 00:48:15,761
Human or not, the park is closed now.

667
00:48:17,431 --> 00:48:18,901
I'm looking for something.

668
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:23,031
If you've lost something, check Lost and Found.

669
00:48:23,971 --> 00:48:25,131
There's no need.

670
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:29,310
I've just found it.

671
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:33,911
What is it?

672
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:38,651
The mirror of the moon.

673
00:48:52,091 --> 00:48:54,161
After my mom passed away,

674
00:48:55,531 --> 00:48:58,071
I felt like I was left all alone in this world.

675
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:01,670
But I wasn't lonely at all...

676
00:49:03,241 --> 00:49:05,111
because I had you and Jae Hwan.

677
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,580
Thanks.

678
00:49:10,051 --> 00:49:11,511
Hang in there.

679
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:15,420
Please.

680
00:49:15,951 --> 00:49:17,051
Ms. Nam.

681
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:19,761
Yes?

682
00:49:20,821 --> 00:49:22,230
You need to take this.

683
00:49:30,531 --> 00:49:32,031
Is someone close to dying?

684
00:49:32,971 --> 00:49:34,040
Where are you?

685
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:41,480
Very close to where you are.

686
00:50:13,111 --> 00:50:14,611
Finally, you're here to see me.

687
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:16,750
- Where's the antidote? - Why are you worried about others?

688
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:18,480
You're day to day yourself.

689
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,750
Where is the antidote?

690
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:21,750
There is no such thing.

691
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:25,721
I was born from the plague, so I know how to kill people,

692
00:50:26,321 --> 00:50:28,390
but I never learned how to save them.

693
00:50:28,761 --> 00:50:30,460
You scumbag.

694
00:50:31,031 --> 00:50:32,631
You'll die soon.

695
00:50:33,073 --> 00:50:35,643
I want you to die and rot in the Underworld.

696
00:50:39,212 --> 00:50:40,712
This is why I like you.

697
00:50:41,542 --> 00:50:45,053
Even though you can barely keep your own soul dominant,

698
00:50:45,413 --> 00:50:47,652
you still won't give in.

699
00:50:49,393 --> 00:50:51,553
- You'll be mine in the end. - As if.

700
00:50:52,623 --> 00:50:54,623
I'd rather die than let you have me.

701
00:50:54,692 --> 00:50:58,192
From this moment on, you'll truly wish you were dead.

702
00:51:00,832 --> 00:51:02,002
Show yourself.

703
00:51:17,612 --> 00:51:19,082
Don't join forces with Lee Yeon.

704
00:51:19,853 --> 00:51:23,053
Those imbeciles are plotting something.

705
00:51:25,252 --> 00:51:26,522
It doesn't matter.

706
00:51:27,792 --> 00:51:29,632
Besides, you have a job to do.

707
00:51:55,927 --> 00:51:56,927
What are you doing here?

708
00:51:58,927 --> 00:52:00,557
The governor was attacked.

709
00:52:01,226 --> 00:52:02,367
What?

710
00:52:04,126 --> 00:52:05,296
What are you talking about?

711
00:52:06,467 --> 00:52:07,537
Who attacked him?

712
00:52:07,936 --> 00:52:08,967
Imoogi.

713
00:52:09,737 --> 00:52:11,206
He survived,

714
00:52:11,737 --> 00:52:14,137
but he lost something important.

715
00:52:21,646 --> 00:52:22,686
You're him, aren't you?

716
00:52:25,046 --> 00:52:26,157
Now comes the quiz.

717
00:52:26,557 --> 00:52:28,787
What exactly was taken from the governor?

718
00:52:34,657 --> 00:52:35,766
The mirror of the moon.

719
00:52:37,367 --> 00:52:38,396
How...

720
00:52:40,836 --> 00:52:44,037
How is it that you have his face?

721
00:52:49,746 --> 00:52:51,677
It's the face you missed, isn't it?

722
00:52:53,146 --> 00:52:55,316
The poor child you killed.

723
00:52:55,646 --> 00:52:56,887
Your one and only son.

724
00:52:58,487 --> 00:53:01,016
My Bok Gil...

725
00:53:01,117 --> 00:53:02,557
When being reincarnated,

726
00:53:02,557 --> 00:53:04,327
I selected the shell that'd stir something in you.

727
00:53:06,157 --> 00:53:08,257
I had a feeling this day would come.

728
00:53:08,726 --> 00:53:10,626
How can you know about my son?

729
00:53:12,027 --> 00:53:13,566
Here comes the next question.

730
00:53:14,137 --> 00:53:17,537
Why do you think my other half went after the mirror of the moon?

731
00:53:20,336 --> 00:53:22,847
No... Granny!

732
00:53:23,206 --> 00:53:25,617
- You're staying here with me. - No...

733
00:53:28,016 --> 00:53:29,146
Shin Ju.

734
00:53:30,086 --> 00:53:32,856
- Why... - Because I was summoned.

735
00:53:35,117 --> 00:53:38,757
Someday, when the Imoogi in her calls for you...

736
00:53:39,726 --> 00:53:42,626
You'll become my soldier.

737
00:53:53,007 --> 00:53:55,106
Bok Gil was a sweet kid, you know.

738
00:53:55,537 --> 00:53:57,407
Others found me repulsive,

739
00:53:57,947 --> 00:53:59,976
but he came up to me to talk.

740
00:54:00,746 --> 00:54:03,086
I felt like I had a friend for the first time.

741
00:54:03,916 --> 00:54:05,146
Did you know this though?

742
00:54:05,686 --> 00:54:07,487
I was the one...

743
00:54:08,617 --> 00:54:11,126
who planted the plague in his wife.

744
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:16,166
Why...

745
00:54:17,766 --> 00:54:18,867
Why did you do such a thing?

746
00:54:22,436 --> 00:54:25,106
Because he seemed so happy.

747
00:54:38,646 --> 00:54:41,557
Darn you!

748
00:55:10,487 --> 00:55:12,316
Let's go. We need Granny.

749
00:55:12,856 --> 00:55:15,257
- It's too late. - Snap out of it, Ji A!

750
00:55:16,257 --> 00:55:19,657
We can both survive this. For the first time, there's hope.

751
00:55:23,527 --> 00:55:24,827
Darn, my head.

752
00:55:28,237 --> 00:55:29,666
- Mr. Lee! - Shin Ju, stay out of this.

753
00:55:29,666 --> 00:55:31,137
Rang, come with me.

754
00:55:32,137 --> 00:55:34,037
- I'm sorry, we... - Later!

755
00:55:35,137 --> 00:55:37,007
You were only compelled by him, that's all.

756
00:55:37,476 --> 00:55:38,507
Take Ji A with you.

757
00:55:39,777 --> 00:55:40,777
Just a second.

758
00:55:45,416 --> 00:55:47,956
Let go. I can get there myself.

759
00:56:03,967 --> 00:56:05,007
Where's Granny?

760
00:56:08,237 --> 00:56:09,407
Where is she?

761
00:56:11,376 --> 00:56:12,407
Did you get her?

762
00:56:14,976 --> 00:56:17,887
It truly is a treasure of a mountain spirit.

763
00:57:01,226 --> 00:57:02,867
Showing up with her son's face...

764
00:57:03,166 --> 00:57:05,427
made her lose her reason.

765
00:57:06,737 --> 00:57:08,896
You can call her the spirit of spirits all you want.

766
00:57:09,666 --> 00:57:11,637
As long as she harbors a human's heart,

767
00:57:12,737 --> 00:57:14,606
she'll always have a weak spot.

768
00:57:25,916 --> 00:57:27,516
This was your plan all along.

769
00:57:27,586 --> 00:57:29,186
It's all your fault, Yeon.

770
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:31,257
Because you didn't give up,

771
00:57:31,427 --> 00:57:34,796
innocent people had to die as well as the old lady.

772
00:57:35,896 --> 00:57:37,766
And now, Ji A is dying too.

773
00:58:32,447 --> 00:58:33,456
Ji A...

774
00:58:35,557 --> 00:58:36,757
Please.

775
00:58:50,436 --> 00:58:52,677
Even in this state, you can't lay a finger on me.

776
00:58:53,637 --> 00:58:56,746
So just give up your body and die.

777
00:58:57,307 --> 00:58:58,876
You're out of options now.

778
00:59:00,476 --> 00:59:02,016
This is the only way to save Ji A.

779
00:59:36,887 --> 00:59:37,947
That's enough.

780
00:59:40,987 --> 00:59:42,086
Let Ji A go.

781
00:59:43,557 --> 00:59:44,757
I'll...

782
00:59:52,367 --> 00:59:53,697
let you have my body.

783
01:00:17,161 --> 01:00:18,560
What are you doing here?

784
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:25,230
Rang, you can't go inside. I won't let you.

785
01:00:28,301 --> 01:00:29,400
Yu Ri.

786
01:00:29,911 --> 01:00:32,670
I'm here to save you and Yeon.

787
01:00:34,641 --> 01:00:36,980
But if anything happens to Yeon,

788
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:41,121
I swear I'll kill you.

789
01:00:49,831 --> 01:00:50,931
Don't.

790
01:00:55,931 --> 01:00:57,400
- Ji A. - Don't move.

791
01:01:01,871 --> 01:01:03,810
You're still hanging in there?

792
01:01:05,610 --> 01:01:06,911
No, don't.

793
01:01:08,181 --> 01:01:09,681
Put that gun down. Please.

794
01:01:13,221 --> 01:01:15,980
I'll protect you, Yeon.

795
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:17,491
No, let me do it.

796
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,460
Goodbye.

797
01:01:51,321 --> 01:01:53,560
No, don't. No!

798
01:01:55,761 --> 01:01:57,161
Come out from that body.

799
01:02:09,170 --> 01:02:12,371
Forgive me. I'm doing this to protect you, Rang.

800
01:02:24,451 --> 01:02:25,520
Yeon.

801
01:02:25,851 --> 01:02:27,060
Don't come near me.

802
01:02:27,391 --> 01:02:29,360
- Yeon! - Stay away!

803
01:02:36,101 --> 01:02:37,331
No!

804
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:43,411
The Yeon you know is dead.

805
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:46,940
I won.

806
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:42,301
What's going on?

807
01:03:44,730 --> 01:03:46,540
I look hideous, don't I?

808
01:03:50,110 --> 01:03:51,310
I wanted to look nice...

809
01:03:53,011 --> 01:03:54,840
before I say goodbye.

810
01:03:58,150 --> 01:03:59,250
But still,

811
01:04:01,721 --> 01:04:02,920
we won.

812
01:04:18,571 --> 01:04:19,871
This is my gift.

813
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,371
When your other half becomes weak,

814
01:04:24,241 --> 01:04:25,540
you become weak as well.

815
01:04:45,130 --> 01:04:48,060
It's the evening primrose from a burial ground.

816
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:22,531
Yeon!

817
01:05:47,321 --> 01:05:48,391
Darn it.

818
01:06:19,451 --> 01:06:20,520
Rang.

819
01:06:23,931 --> 01:06:25,261
Rang!

820
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:36,040
It hurts, doesn't it?

821
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:40,181
You and I are one now.

822
01:06:40,610 --> 01:06:43,081
If you kill me, you'll die as well.

823
01:06:43,650 --> 01:06:44,781
That's exactly what I want.

824
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:10,270
Rang.

825
01:07:10,671 --> 01:07:12,871
No, I can't.

826
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:17,110
Pretty soon,

827
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:20,081
I'll turn into Imoogi.

828
01:07:23,050 --> 01:07:24,791
Let me stay as myself.

829
01:07:29,161 --> 01:07:30,260
Rang.

830
01:07:30,831 --> 01:07:31,930
No.

831
01:07:57,690 --> 01:07:58,720
Rang.

832
01:07:59,961 --> 01:08:01,591
Save me.

833
01:08:43,871 --> 01:08:46,400
I will be born again.

834
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:48,800
I will be born again,

835
01:08:49,841 --> 01:08:51,741
and I will find her again.

836
01:08:53,881 --> 01:08:55,081
You don't know what you're talking about.

837
01:08:56,341 --> 01:08:58,251
Once you fall into the Samdo River,

838
01:08:59,150 --> 01:09:00,781
you'll never be able to come back.

839
01:09:15,230 --> 01:09:16,300
No.

840
01:09:39,690 --> 01:09:40,720
No.

841
01:09:50,470 --> 01:09:51,571
I love you.

842
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:54,741
No!

843
01:09:57,071 --> 01:09:58,140
No!

844
01:10:37,911 --> 01:10:39,150
He smiled.

845
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:43,520
As if he was relieved...

846
01:10:43,690 --> 01:10:45,520
that he had saved me.

847
01:10:46,350 --> 01:10:49,961
As if this was his happy ending.

848
01:10:54,131 --> 01:10:55,360
I feel like...

849
01:10:58,571 --> 01:11:00,341
I may have heard...

850
01:11:00,470 --> 01:11:01,841
Yeon!

851
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:03,571
the word "love" at the end.

852
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:43,550
(Tale of The Nine Tailed)

853
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:46,411
I can really do anything you ask.

854
01:11:47,381 --> 01:11:48,520
Please tell me...

855
01:11:48,751 --> 01:11:51,220
That will never happen.

856
01:11:51,921 --> 01:11:54,461
Get it together. Mr. Lee told me to give this to you.

857
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:57,760
You'll get used to it. I'm sure you'll have to walk...

858
01:11:58,991 --> 01:12:01,161
the path we walked together, alone,

859
01:12:02,001 --> 01:12:03,701
but please let me go.

860
01:12:04,430 --> 01:12:05,900
I love you, Ji A.

861
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:09,900
I heard the rumors and came to see that old man.
