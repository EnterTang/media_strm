《复仇》前情提要
Previously on Revenge

10
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,080
-当时沙滩上是否还有别人  -没有
- Was there someone else on that beach? - No

11
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:08,000
杰克手里有件会直接将他与
Jack's been sitting on a hoodie that

12
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,670
谋杀案联系起来的运动衫
directly links him to the murder.

13
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,670
把他引出去几个小时吧
Just try to get him out of there for a couple of hours.

14
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,900
那是什么  你运动衫上的是血迹吗
What's that? On your sweatshirt, is that blood?

15
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,930
你说要让李听凭你摆布时
When you said you were gonna use Lee as your pawn,

16
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:16,590
你果然不是在开玩笑啊
you weren't kidding.

17
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,470
将死
Checkmate.

18
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,450
如果我要死
If I'm going down,

19
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,910
我一定拉上你们给我陪葬
I'm taking you down with me.

20
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,480
丹尼尔  你脚上的监视器
Daniel, your ankle monitor--

21
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,020
警察  把手举起来  不许动
Police! Hands up. Don't move.

22
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,590
听说有人上吊自杀了
They're saying someone hanged himself.

23
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,180
还在遗言中承认了杀害泰勒的罪行
And confessed to killing tyler.

24
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,250
又有一个大卫・克拉克要处理了
We have another David Clarke-style situation.

25
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,310
那是康拉德的声音吗
Is that Conrad?

26
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,410
我爸爸是被格雷森家族给谋杀的
The Graysons murdered my father.

27
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:42,540
赦免是宽恕中最强有力的方式
Absolution is the most powerful form of forgiveness...

28
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,150
它冲破怀疑与责任  寻求彻底的宽恕
A full pardon from suspicion and accountability.

29
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,480
解放被剥夺的未来
It's the liberation of a stolen future.

30
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:52,750
大卫・克拉克

31
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,560
那个我父亲无法亲眼见证的未来
A future my father never lived to see.

32
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:00,880
赦免
Absolution...

33
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,790
对于那些杀害他的人只能是永不可知的怜悯
is a mercy that people who killed him will never know.

34
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,090
流浪汉李・莫伦
The timing of the confession

35
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,660
在监狱中自杀并认罪
and jailhouse suicide of drifter Lee Moran.

36
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,170
恰巧发生在被告方准备
Coming just hours before the defense

37
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:16,350
开庭辩护的几个小时前
was to present their case,

38
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,120
这使那些密切关注
has raised suspicions among those who are carefully watching

39
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,340
这场所谓世纪审判的人大为怀疑
what many are calling the new trial of the decade.

40
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,340
伊丽莎白・霍桑法官整个早上
Judge Elizabeth Hawthorne spent all morning in chambers

41
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,260
都在闭门和控辩双方对话
with the prosecution and defense teams.

42
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,090
现在年轻的亿万富翁丹尼尔・格雷森的命运
And now billionaire Daniel Grayson's fate

43
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,750
仍然悬而未决
hangs in the balance.

44
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,440
舆论认为格雷森的清白
And still, Grayson's innocence remains very much in question

45
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,310
仍存有很大的疑虑
in the court of public opinion.

46
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,010
静音

47
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,140
是啊  还用得着说吗
Yeah, I'll say.

48
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,690
如果格里森是幕后黑手的话
You know, if the Graysons are behind all this,

49
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,180
你必须要跟夏洛特保持距离
you're gonna have to steer clear of Charlotte.

50
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,820
就像你对阿曼达・克拉克那样吗
Like you did with Amanda Clarke?

51
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,330
夏洛特走上现在这条歪道
Charlotte's headed down a really bad path,

52
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,160
我也有不可推卸的责任
and I'm partly to blame.

53
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,830
没错
Well, exactly.

54
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,360
所以一旦格雷森们发现了你也脱不了关系
Now that the Graysons know that you lied on the stand,

55
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,980
天知道他们会怎么来对付你
there's no telling what they might do to you.

56
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,660
恐怖分子大卫・克拉克在巴罗监狱被杀

57
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,350
我来猜猜看
Let me guess.

58
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,360
你正忙着制定你的婚礼宾客名单呢
You're working on your wedding invite list.

59
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,930
看来救你未婚夫的计谋
Well, assuming your ploy to spring your fiance

60
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,210
成功了
actually works,

61
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,750
但怎么可能不成功 你可是艾米莉啊
but why wouldn't it? You're you.

62
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,410
这是当年跟我爸爸住一个
These are the names of the prisoners

63
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,510
监狱楼的犯人名单
from my father's cell block.

64
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,460
我已经找出了我爸爸被杀那天
I've identified everyone who was involved in the riots

65
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,280
所有参与了那场监狱暴乱的人
the day that my father was murdered.

66
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,290
接下来干什么呢
Now what?

67
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,920
把这份名单跟格雷森家寄出的
Cross-reference it with the

68
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,390
圣诞贺卡名单对照一下吗
Grayson christmas card list?

69
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,220
诺兰  你知道捅死我爸的人
Nolan, you know the man that stabbed my father

70
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,360
一直没有找到
was never identified.

71
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,230
康拉德可能给了他们家一笔钱
Conrad could have made payments to their families.

72
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,620
或者安排他由于表现良好提早释放
He could have arranged for early pardon for good behavior.

73
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,500
又一桩罪行掩盖吗
Another cover-up?

74
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,010
康拉德在电话里说
Conrad said on the phone,

75
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,980
"抱歉又得让你干这件事了"
"I'm sorry to put us in this position again."

76
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,300
如果他们杀了李来灭口的话
If they killed Lee to silence him,

77
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,700
极有可能他们当年也采取了
it's a very strong possibility

78
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,160
同样的方法来对付我爸爸
that they did the same to my father.

79
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,520
你这是要去哪儿
Where are you off to now?

80
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,810
我去看看夏洛特  我很担心她
I'm going to check on Charlotte. I'm worried about her.

81
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,740
这幅画其实也算不上是多米尼克的佳作
Well, it's not exactly Dominik's best work.

82
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,920
我倒是觉得看上去有点杂乱无章
Looks a little half-assed if you ask me.

83
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,660
这是幅未完成的作品
It's unfinished.

84
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,450
早知道你这么有受虐倾向的话
You know, if I'd known you were such a masochist,

85
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,020
我倒是很愿意往你的伤口上撒上这把盐
I'd have volunteered to rub this salt in your wounds myself.

86
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:28,970
别这样嘛
Oh, come on.

87
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,780
你平常不是巧舌如簧的吗
Where's the witty repartee?

88
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,000
在你这种精神折磨之下
If you're expecting me to reveal so much

89
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,020
如果你指望我会表现出一丝痛心
as a wince of pain at the hands of your emotional torture,

90
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,500
你真是做梦
you can forget it.

91
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,420
好吧
Well...

92
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,830
不得不说我有点失望呢
Color me disappointed.

93
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,250
别  康拉德
Don't be, Conrad.

94
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,910
当我选择反击时  你好日子就到头了
When I choose to react, you'll know it.

95
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,590
我不仅会让你对你做犯下的
And I guarantee that you'll not just regret

96
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,830
每一桩罪行后悔不已
each and every one of your petty little torments,

97
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,310
还会让你品尝到十倍于今日
but that the suffering you so glibly spread around

98
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,790
你所带来的痛苦
will come back at you tenfold.

99
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,940
夏洛特  我是艾米莉
Charlotte, it's Emily.

100
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,020
丹尼尔出什么事了吗
Has something happened with Daniel?

101
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,050
没  我们还在等结果
No. We're still waiting.

102
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,620
你还好吗
How are you?

103
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,430
我没事  进来吧
I'm all right. Come in.

104
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,260
这都是些什么
What's all this?

105
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,550
属于我的
My version of...

106
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,000
父女时光
father-daughter time.

107
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,740
我妈妈对于他闭口不提
My mom won't tell me anything about him,

108
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:41,040
大卫・克拉克  本土恐怖分子

109
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,330
这是所有我能在公开信息中找到关于他的了
So this is everything i could find on public record

110
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,830
还有一些则是私底下的
And some that isn't.

111
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,730
我在我妈首饰盒的夹层里
I found this hidden in the lining

112
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:49,000
找到了这张照片
of my mother's jewelry box.

113
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,690
你看看背面的日期
Look at the date.

114
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,130
2002年4月22日
April 22, 2002.

115
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,140
他正是在这一天去世的
The day he died.

116
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,260
她从哪儿来的这张照片
I wonder where she got this.

117
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,250
他看上去并不像个恶人对吗
He doesn't look like a monster, does he?

118
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,700
不像
No.

119
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,460
他看上去很害怕
He looks scared.

120
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,250
我也是这么认为的
That's what I think, too.

121
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,470
我得去上学了
I have to get to school.

122
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,480
无穷小盒里有一本日记不见了
There's a journal missing from the infinity box.

123
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,430
你怎么知道的
How do you know?

124
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,970
因为在他临死前的一张照片里
Because he's holding one in a picture

125
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,250
他正拿着那本日记
taken the day he died.

126
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,130
什么照片
What picture?

127
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,630
照片不是重点  诺兰
The photograph isn't the point, Nolan.

128
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,430
重点是那本日记
It's the journal and the fact

129
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,290
我爸因为信任你把那盒子整个都交给了你
that my father trusted you with the box first.

130
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,880
艾米
Ems...

131
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,370
我把你父亲托付给我的东西全都交给了你
I gave you everything that your father asked me to give you.

132
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,090
而且
I mean...

133
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,620
如果真有这东西的话  我干嘛瞒着你呢
Why would I hold something like that back from you?

134
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,490
我也不知道
I don't know.

135
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,940
还正想问问你呢
You tell me.

136
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,120
我一会儿再打给你
I'll call you right back.

137
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,910
我只是遵照你父亲的遗愿
I was only honoring your father's wishes.

138
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:04,110
你知道我听到你这么说有多恶心吗
Do you know how sick I am of hearing you say that?

139
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,820
我没有说谎  我发誓
It's the truth. I swear.

140
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,510
在他去世前的最后几个月
In the last few months of his life,

141
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,710
你父亲被吓坏了  变得偏执多疑所以
your father was paranoid and terrified and--

142
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,560
所以什么
And what?

143
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:17,090
所以他不希望在你心里留下这种印象
And he wouldn't have wanted you to remember him like that.

144
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:20,250
我向你的父亲承诺过会保护好他的遗物
I promised that I would protect your father's legacy,

145
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,980
而我也确实是这么去做的
and that's exactly what I've done.

146
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,660
从今以后  别再插手此事了  诺兰
From now on, you stay the hell out of this Nolan,

147
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,620
不然我发誓  我会保证你插手不了
or I swear to God, I will make sure that you do.

148
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,760
《复仇》第一季第十九集

149
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,560
"自我被捕那一刻起
"From the moment of my arrest,

150
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,700
就呆坐着  信任着
I sat stupid and trusting,

151
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,950
坚信一个受人操控的司法系统
believing in a system rigged against me

152
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,420
而始作俑者正是那些我曾称为朋友的人
by the people that I knew as friends

153
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,790
那时的生活至今早已模糊了"
in a life that I can no longer remember."

154
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,990
"我越接近真相
"The closer I get to the truth,

155
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,190
身边的窃窃私语就越响
the louder the whispered voices around me,

156
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,620
谋划着我的死刑
plotting my execution,

157
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,480
挑选着时机"
choosing the time."

158
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:16,060
"如今我知道  我受困于命运与自由的较量中"
"I now know that I'm trapped in a race between fate and freedom."

159
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,810
"无论哪一方获胜  我不会再次保持沉默"
"Whichever wins out, I won't go quietly, not again."

160
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,390
"C.M.明天会带证据来"
"C.M. Will come tomorrow with proof."

161
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,060
C.M.
C.M.?

162
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,790
C.M.
C.M.

163

2002年4月24日辞世

168
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,780
杰克  别担心
Jack, don't worry.

169
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:41,540
德克兰现在不是格雷森家的目标
Declan is barely a blip on the Graysons' radar at this point.

170
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,060
那艾米莉呢
What about Emily?

171
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,500
她知道自己将要嫁进怎样的家庭吗
Does she have any idea what she's about to marry into?

172
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,520
艾米莉现在可没心情
Well, Emily's not exactly in the mood

173
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,130
听任何格雷森家的负面新闻了
to absorb any more negative Grayson press right now...

174
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,510
尤其是从我这听到
Especially from me.

175
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,560
不过也许她会听你的
But maybe she would listen to you.

176
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,250
顺便一问  你外带杯吗
Do you have a to-go cup, by the way?

177
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,830
干什么  你要上哪去
Why? Where have you gotta be?

178
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,060
我不光只会卖萌
Well, contrary to popular belief,

179
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,310
哥还是有个跨国公司要经营
I do have a multinational company to run.

180
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:07,350
我过两天还要出差呢
I'm gonna be gone on business for a few days.

181
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,090
好了  再见  杰克
All right. Bye, Jack.

182
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,010
给我电话
Call me.

183
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,480
经济学的突击测验你没来
Missed a pop quiz in Econ.

184
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,400
供需原则
Laws of supply and demand.

185
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,100
我知道定义
I think I understand the concept.

186
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,010
最后一瓶了  夏洛特
Make this one last, Char.

187

我爸到时候会发现他的病历单丢失的
My dad's gonna start missing his scrip pad.

188
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,260
你可不是学校里唯一能搞到药的  亚当
You're not the only guy in school with connections, Adam.

189
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,960
但最好我是你唯一献身的
But I better be the only one you're giving it up to.

190
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,840
抱歉
Sorry.

191
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:42,760
糟糕的一天
Bad day.

192
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,620
你不能再翘课了
You gotta stop blowing off class.

193
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,220
大家都开始议论纷纷
People are starting to talk.

194
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,740
由得他们
Let them.

195
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,530
我哥的这场噩梦结束以后
I'll pull it together

196
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,830
我就会振作起来的
when this nightmare with my brother is over.

197
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,360
在那之前
Until then...

198
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,860
你看什么呢  码头老鼠
What are you staring at, wharf rat?

199
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,000
没什么
Nothing.

200
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,560
我们能谈谈吗
Can we talk?

201
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,930
不能
No.

202
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,980
我们走吧  亚当
Let's get outta here, Adam.

203
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,650
新仁光医院档案室
New Mercy Hospital, archives.

204
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,640
你好  我想问一下你们的工作时间
Hi there. I'm just wondering, uh, what are your hours?

205
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,780
周一到周五  早上七点至下午四点
7:00-4:00, Monday through Friday.

206
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:20,450
死亡证明

207
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,300
如果你需要病史档案的话
If you'd like to request a medical record,

208
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,860
我可以给你寄一份申请表
I can mail you a legal form.

209
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,910
不用了  我稍后会自己过去取
No, that's all right. I'll come in and get one later.

210
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,870
杰克
Jack.

211
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:33,610
进来吧
Come on in.

212
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,940
你怎么样
How are you?

213
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,370
其实这话应该我问你吧
Actually, that was gonna be my question to you.

214
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,330
你要喝什么吗
Can I get you something to drink?

215
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:45,110
不用了  谢谢
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

216
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:48,310
一定很不容易吧
It can't be easy,

217
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,000
坐等别人宣布丹尼尔的命运
waiting to hear about Daniel's fate.

218
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,080
的确很不容易
No. No, none of it's easy.

219
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,810
你以为有人亲手写下的认罪书
You'd think that a written confession by someone

220
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:58,060
足以让法官撤销指控了  但是
would be enough for the judge to drop the charges, but...

221
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,840
更别提他们找到的那件带血帽衫了
Not to mention the bloody hoodie they found in his possession.

222
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,660
真神奇啊
It's kind of amazing...

223
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,550
一切就这样迎刃而解了  你不觉得吗
The way it all worked out, don't you think?

224
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,380
什么意思
How do you mean?

225
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,060
就是
Just...

226
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,010
格雷森一家有权有势
The Graysons are very powerful people.

227
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,130
也许那些法庭外的抗议者并不无道理
Maybe the protesters aren't as far off as you might think.

228
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,620
杰克  丹尼尔没有杀泰勒
Jack, Daniel didn't kill Tyler.

229
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,580
我没说他杀了
I'm not saying that he did.

230
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,670
那你是什么意思
Then what are you saying?

231
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,790
我是说  在嫁进他们家之前
That there are some things you might want to think about

232
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,140
有些事你得三思
before marrying into that family.

233
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,760
艾米莉  我有些事要告诉你
Emily, there's something I need to tell you.

234
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,050
抱歉打断一下
Oh, excuse me.

235
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:47,320
你好
Hello.

236
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,440
他们撤消了所有指控
They dropped all charges.

237
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,160
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

238
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,540
我马上就到
Okay, I'll be right there.

239
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,370
杰克  我
Jack, I'm...

240
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,820
听着像是好消息  你去接他吧
Sounds like good news. You should go get him.

241
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,030
抱歉  我不是故意
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to--

242
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,000
不  是我不对  我突然来访
No, no, I'm sorry. I practically ambushed you.

243
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,470
我们迟些再谈
We can talk later.

244
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,240
你有我的名片六个多月了
You've had my business card for over six months.

245
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:31,120
时间宝贵  麦高恩先生
Timing is everything, Mr. Mcgowen.

246
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,200
你已经将格雷森国际的股票套了现
And now that you've cashed out your shares of Grayson Global,

247
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,230
我是不是可以认为
is it safe to assume

248
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,350
你已经万事俱备了
that the stars are properly aligned for you?

249
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:38,980
差不多吧
Nearly.

250
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,390
我要求完全豁免权
I want full immunity in exchange

251
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,450
以换取我将要告诉你的信息
for the information I'm about to give you.

252
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,070
在搞清楚我们要说什么之前
I can't guarantee anything

253
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,940
我无法保证任何事
till I know what we're talking about.

254
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,580
若你无法给予我保护
If you can't offer me protection,

255
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,380
我更愿意去和你证交会的上司谈
I'm more than happy to go to your superiors at the S.E.C.,

256
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,790
或者联邦调查局  中央情报局
or to the director of the FBI, the CIA,

257
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,480
或是其他任何有权定罪
or any other agency who would like to lay claim

258
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:01,200
国内恐怖分子的机构
to the conviction of a domestic terrorist.

259
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,450
恐怖分子
A terrorist?

260
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,580
我还以为你要揭露
I thought you had information

261
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,400
你丈夫公司的不法行为
about your husband's corporate malfeasance.

262
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,840
如此看来  麦高恩先生  这两样是同一件事
In this case, Mr. Mcgowen, they're one and the same.

263
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,710
我们达成一致了吗
Now do we have a deal or not?

264
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:14,910
让我打个电话
Let me make a phone call.

265
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:31,640
丹尼尔
Daniel.

266
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:45,340
凶手  凶手  凶手
Murderer! Murderer! Murderer!

267
00:13:58,610 --> 00:13:59,980
凶手

268
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,430
你真的没事吗
You sure you're all right?

269
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,600
你几乎一言不发
You've barely said two words.

270
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:16,910
很遗憾你的车成了这样
Sorry about your car.

271
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,110
这事会逐渐平息的
This will eventually die down.

272
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,650
会没事的
It's gonna be okay.

273
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,020
恭喜  儿子
Congratulations, son.

274
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,220
欢迎回家
Welcome home.

275
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,150
欢迎回家  丹尼尔
Welcome home, Daniel.

276
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,290
丹尼尔
Daniel.

277
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,390
谢天谢地总算结束了
Thank God it's finally over.

278
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,650
离结束还早着呢
No, this is a long way from over.

279
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,140
丹尼尔有些吓到了
Daniel's a little shaken.

280
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,720
监狱外有人在我车上喷漆
Somebody spray painted "Murderer" on my car

281
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,670
留下"凶手"两字
outside of the prison.

282
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,360
太可怕了
That's horrible.

283
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,050
是啊  媒体都快把监狱门给拆了
Yeah, the press were practically handing out pitchforks at the gate.

284
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,210
他说的一点也不夸张
He's not far off.

285
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,880
《时代》杂志在质疑
"The times" are questioning

286
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,370
认罪的真实性
the veracity of the confession,

287
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,790
八卦版用了一整版来历数
"Page Six" is running a full-page chronicle

288
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,540
丹尼尔过去不务正业的行径
of Daniel's past party-boy ways,

289
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,340
特德韦尔的"反格雷森"博客
and Treadwell's anti-Grayson blog

290
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,360
被各大主流媒体争相转载
is being rerun in every major newspaper.

291
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,740
这事情一时半会平息不了
This story isn't dying down any time soon.

292
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,750
我们不会让他们挖到新闻的
Well, then we'll starve the beast.

293
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,740
丹尼尔问心无愧
Daniel has nothing to hide.

294
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,030
我认为他现在最好的选择就是
I think the best thing for him to do

295
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,570
直面媒体  说出事情的真相
would be to get in front of the cameras, tell his story.

296
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:09,770
她说的对
She's right.

297
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,940
进攻是最好的防御
The best way to hit this is head-on.

298
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,700
所有主流媒体
Well, all the majors

299
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,800
可都在门口堵着呢
are practically banging down the door--

300
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,980
例如《晚间报道》  《早安美国》
"Nightline," "Good Morning America."

301
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,070
任由我们选
We can have our pick.

302
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,760
我两天都没合过眼了
Listen, I haven't slept in over 48 hours.

303
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,840
我现在无法清醒地做决定
I-I can't make that decision right now.

304
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,050
我去歇一会儿  好吗
I'm gonna crash for a while, okay?

305
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,770
当然  你得好好休息一下
Yeah, of course. You need some rest.

306
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,010
帮我转告夏洛特
Someone tell Charlotte

307
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,640
等我醒来后  再去好好拥抱她
I'll give her a big hug when I wake up.

308
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:31,040
做个好梦  亲爱的
Sweet dreams, darling.

309
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,750
你该好好地睡一觉了
You deserve them.

310
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,130
维多利亚  我能占用点时间和你谈谈吗
Victoria, could I talk with you for a moment?

311
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,590
当然
Of course.

312
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,000
那我们明天再见吧
I guess I'll see you all tomorrow.

313
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,840
好的
Yes.

314
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,510
怎么了  阿什莉
What is it, Ashley?

315
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,730
既然丹尼尔已经被释放了
Now that Daniel's been officially released,

316
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,320
我想正式提出辞职
I'd like to formally give my notice.

317
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,740
理所当然
Of course.

318
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,180
在你充分展现自己其他才能后
I had no delusions that you would return to party planning

319
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:01,340
我没有奢望你会委身重返派对策划岗位
after you so aptly showcased your other talents.

320
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,530
遗憾的是  我没足够的时间
Unfortunately, I won't have time

321
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,690
找个合适的接任者了
to find you a suitable replacement.

322
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,950
不用麻烦了
Oh, that won't be necessary.

323
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,250
汉普顿多得是
The Hamptons are filthy

324
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,100
你这样野心勃勃的小丫头
with ambitious young girls like yourself.

325
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,650
我能问一下你要去哪里高就吗
May I ask where you've landed?

326
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:15,420
布鲁克斯先生帮我在他的律师事务所里
Mr. Brooks has offered me a media relations position

327
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,040
找了个媒体相关的工作
at his law firm.

328
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,760
原来如此
Ah, well...

329
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,950
既然布鲁克斯先生还在为我们工作
As Mr. Brooks is still on retainer to us,

330
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,460
我想请你帮我个忙
I would like to ask you a favor.

331
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,680
如果丹尼尔真的错听建议  接受访谈
If Daniel does indeed grant this ill-advised interview,

332
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,720
我希望你能随时向我们通报媒体进展
I would like you to remain as our media liaison

333
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,840
直到一切平息为止
until it's over.

334
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,030
丹尼尔为我做过那么多事
That's the least I can do for Daniel

335
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,100
这点小忙我还是能帮的
after all he's done for me.

336
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,100
卡罗尔・米勒

337
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,360
治疗医师
莱尔・詹姆森

338
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,810
我是莱尔・詹姆森
Lyle Jameson.

339
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:14,930
你好  医生
Doctor, uh,

340
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:16,950
我是新仁光医院的伊芙・特科
this is Eve Tucker at New Mercy Hospital.

341
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,720
我们正在升级系统
We're updating our system,

342
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,270
有一名我们两家医院共同的患者
and I needed to cross-check our records

343
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,570
在认定其死因前  我需要再向您核准一下
before confirming cause of death of a patient we shared.

344
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,180
死者叫卡罗尔・米勒
Her name is Carole Miller.

345
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,960
我想我不记得有这个人
I'm afraid I don't recognize the name.

346
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,840
可能是事隔太久了
Perhaps it's because it's been a long time.

347
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,880
她2002年死于我们医院
She died here in 2002,

348
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,610
根据档案记录  您是
but it has you listed

349
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,820
她在兰开斯特的家庭医生
as her primary care physician in Lancaster.

350
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,490
她身高五英尺五英寸
Um... 5'5",

351
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,680
生于1950年
born in 1950,

352
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,940
患有二型糖尿病
type 2 diabetic.

353
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,380
有名叫卡罗尔・托马斯的病人符合你的描述
I have a Carole Thomas matching that description,

354
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,360
但她仍然健康地活着
but she's alive and well.

355
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:50,810
肯定是笔误了
That must have been a clerical error.

356
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,120
没错
Yes, it must have been.

357
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,950
谢谢你
Thank you.

358
00:17:55,630 --> 00:18:00,300
宾州  兰开斯特

359
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,940
请问找谁
Can I help you?

360
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,670
你是卡罗尔・米勒吗
Carole Miller?

361
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,940
你找错人了
You have the wrong house.

362
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,620
我想我没走错  米勒夫人
I don't think so, Ms. Miller.

363
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,910
我是艾莉森・罗德尼
Alison Rodner from

364
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,040
在国土安全部工作
the department of Homeland Security.

365
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,270
我想和你谈谈康拉德・格雷森的事
I need to talk to you about Conrad Grayson.

366
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:34,460
你在格雷森国际
You worked for Grayson Global

367
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,000
给康拉德・格雷森做了18年的私人助理
as Conrad Grayson's personal secretary for 18 years,

368
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,720
我说的没错吧
is that right?

369
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,760
你明显知道答案了
Well, you obviously know the answer to that

370
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,280
否则你就不会来这里了
or you wouldn't be here.

371
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,230
那好吧
All right then.

372
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,570
你和大卫・克拉克
What was the nature of your relationship

373
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:47,240
有什么关系
with David Clarke?

374
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,040
没有任何关系
There was no relationship.

375
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,990
他替格雷森先生工作  不是替我工作
He worked for Mr. Grayson, not me.

376
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,940
那他因为197航班袭击案而被判刑
Were you surprised to hear that he was convicted

377
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,030
你感到震惊吗
for the downing of flight 197?

378
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,170
谁都没预料到会发生这种事
No one saw that coming.

379
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,040
可你料到了  对吗
But you did, didn't you?

380
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,350
茶里要加糖吗
Um, do you take sugar with your tea?

381
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,050
不用了
No.

382
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:10,470
现在
Now...

383
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,580
让我再看一下你的证件
Let me see that I.D. of yours again,

384
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:15,860
看看你是不是你所说的身份
and let's verify that you are who you say you are.

385
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,440
别  别  别  别
No, no, no, no.

386
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,490
卡罗尔阿姨
Aunt Carole,

387
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,820
把抢放下
just... Put down the gun.

388
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,340
卡罗尔阿姨
Aunt Carole?

389
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,720
这到底是怎么回事
What the hell is going on?

390
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,240
卡罗尔阿姨  这位是
Aunt Carole, meet, uh...

391
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,830
阿曼达・克拉克
Amanda Clarke,

392
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,610
大卫・克拉克的女儿
David Clarke's daughter.

393
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,090
我从麻省理工辍学后
Look, after I dropped out of M.I.T.

394
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:50,510
我老爸就把我踢出了家门
and my old man kicked me to the curb,

395
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,450
卡罗尔阿姨收留了我
aunt Carole took me in.

396
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,470
是她把我介绍给了你爸爸
She was the one that introduced me to your dad.

397
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,660
而你却背叛了他
And then you betrayed him.

398
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,900
不  她没有
No, she didn't.

399
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,060
她一直站在他那边
She was always on his side.

400
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,070
诺兰来找我
Nolan came to me

401
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:03,800
告诉我  他与狱中的大卫
and told me he had formed a bond with David

402
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,600
建立了联系
while he was in prison

403
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:08,000
他相信你父亲是被陷害的
and that he believed that your father had been set up.

404
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:10,820
于是我开始从格雷森国际内部
So I started investigating Grayson Global

405
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,420
开始调查
from the inside out,

406
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:15,310
我从而认识了一个叫罗杰・霍尔斯特德的人
and that led me to a man named Roger Halsted.

407
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,540
格雷森的高级会计
Grayson's senior accountant.

408
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,630
是的  是他
Yes, he's the one

409
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,410
发现了能把康拉德和恐怖分子联系起来的
that discovered the discrepancies in the books

410
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,790
账目出入之处
that connected Conrad to the terrorists.

411
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,410
我知道他是谁
Yeah, I know who he is.

412
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,500
他以为他手中的证据足以击垮康拉德
He thought he had enough evidence to hang Conrad

413
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,110
还你父亲一个清白
and exonerate your father.

414
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,670
那你们怎么不提交证据呢
Then why didn't you?

415
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,500
我们一直没找到机会
We never got the chance.

416
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:35,050
当我去监狱告诉你父亲
When I went to the prison to tell your dad

417
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,860
卡罗尔的新发现时
what Carole had learned,

418
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,200
监狱已经进入一级防范禁闭状态
they were already in lockdown.

419
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,350
大卫刚刚被杀害了
David had just been killed.

420
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,980
卡罗尔  是我
Carole, it's me.

421
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,630
你现在要按我说的做
I need you to do exactly as I say.

422
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,650
站起来  从你的座位走开
Get up and walk away from your desk.

423
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:49,690
不要拿你的包
Do not take your purse.

424
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,410
假装你只是去走廊转转  快走
Just act like you're walking down the hall. Do it now!

425
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,960
-你吓到我了  -那就对了
- You're scaring me. - Good.

426
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,340
叫辆出租车
Get in a cab and take it

427
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,560
直接开到那年夏天我们去的地方
straight to that place we went that one summer,

428
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,030
那个养马的地方
with the horses.

429
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,810
别去你的公寓
Do not stop off at your apartment.

430
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,310
我会在目的地等你
I'll be waiting when you get there.

431
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,660
就这样
So...

432
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,300
他救了我的命
He saved my life.

433
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,370
然后假造了你的死亡证明
By faking your death.

434
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,220
跟她说说那个白发人的事
Tell her about the white-haired man.

435
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,460
那时有个人
There was a man who

436
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,940
多次拜访过格雷森
visited Grayson a handful of times.

437
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,990
这些会面从不允许记录
Now these meetings were always off the books.

438
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,720
我第一次见到那个人
The first time I saw him

439
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,430
是在飞机遇难前的那一年
was a year to the day before that plane went down.

440
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,820
最后一次
The last time

441
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,240
则是在你父亲去世的那天早上
was the morning your father died.

442
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:29,870
你还记得他的名字吗
Do you remember his name?

443
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,830
他没有透露过
He never gave it.

444
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,600
但我永远忘不掉那张脸
But I will never forget his face.

445
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,310
他有满头白发
He had a full head of white hair

446
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,960
一双冰冷的蓝眼睛
and ice-blue eyes,

447
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,950
周身散发着令人不寒而栗的气息
and there was something so terrifying about him.

448
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:45,480
光天白日之下  他竟也能让康拉德畏惧
And I know he frightened Conrad even in the bright of day.

449
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,310
艾米
Ems...

450
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,720
真抱歉
I'm sorry.

451
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,910
但我不能把最后那本日记给你
But I could not give you that last journal.

452
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:03,600
对我来说  这比你报复格雷森
This is bigger to me than your revenge

453
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,910
更为重要
against the Graysons.

454
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:07,020
-这事关我的...  -家人
-  This is my-- - Family.

455
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,250
我理解
I know.

456
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,560
为了保护家人  我也会不惜代价的
I would've done anything to protect mine, too.

457
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,360
你来这有何贵干
What the hell are you doing here?

458
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,860
我是来把这个还给你
I wanted to give you this.

459
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,450
我的手机
My phone?

460
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,940
你从哪弄来的
How did you get this?

461
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,630
泰勒被杀那晚  我从他身上拿走的
I took it out of Tyler's jacket the night he was murdered.

462
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,340
什么
What?

463
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,500
是我在沙滩上  拖行了他的尸体
I'm the one who dragged his body up the beach.

464
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,200
也是你打晕了我吗
Are you also the one who hit me?

465
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:45,970
不是
No.

466
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,280
我没看到案发过程
And I didn't see what happened.

467
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,950
但我听到了枪声  赶到海边
I heard gunshots and I went to the water,

468
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:49,950
泰勒已经倒在那里了
and Tyler was lying there.

469
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:50,640
我以为那是你
I thought it was you,

470
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,490
然后我听到夏洛特和德克兰的声音
and then I heard Charlotte and Declan,

471
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:54,050
我慌了神
and I... I panicked.

472
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,010
既然你了解这些情况
Well, so much for your stand-up image,

473
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,320
还眼睁睁地看我被人冤枉
you were just gonna let 'em fry me?

474
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:01,080
我跟你说了
I told you,

475
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,560
我不知道是谁杀了泰勒
I don't know who killed Tyler.

476
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,050
但有一件事我很确定
But I do know one thing for certain--

477
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,980
在李・莫伦车里发现的那件带血帽衫
The bloody hoodie they found in Lee Moran's car

478
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,930
并不是他的
didn't belong to Lee Moran.

479
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,330
而是我的
It belonged to me.

480
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,320
我认为你父母
I think your parents

481
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,030
指使他潜入我家偷了那件帽衫
hired him to break in and steal it from me.

482
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,930
然后说服他承认罪行
And then what, convinced him to confess to the crime

483
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,460
自我了断吗
and hang himself?

484
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:28,360
你为什么要告诉我这些
Why are you telling me this?

485
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,340
因为艾米丽信任你
'Cause Emily trusts you.

486
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:35,030
如果她要与你共度此生
And if she's gonna spend her life with you,

487
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:38,600
为了她  你就不能无视这些事
you owe it to her not to ignore this.

488
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,830
你在干什么
What are you doing?

489
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,080
你没有这个权利
You have no right.

490
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,540
你最好控制一下你的情绪
You might want to dial back on that indignation.

491
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,290
你的行为不仅违反了校规
You just violated the honor code,

492
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,940
还触犯了州法律
not to mention state law.

493
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,740
-你陷害我  -夏洛特  你需要帮助
- You set me up. - Charlotte, you need help.

494
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,410
你真可悲
You're pathetic!

495
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:06,720
如果我被学校开除了
If I'm getting kicked out of this school,

496
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,020
你也跑不掉
so are you.

497
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,030
我会让爸爸断了你下学期的学费
I'm telling my dad to pull your tuition next semester.

498
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,140
你玩完了
You're done here.

499
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,260
够了  走吧
That's enough. Come on.

500
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,410
别碰我
Don't touch me!

501
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:20,870
布鲁克斯先生
Mr. Brooks,

502
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:23,170
我以为您在这的工作已经结束了
I thought your work here was finished.

503
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,130
正在收尾
Nearly.

504
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,630
希望您不介意
I hope you're not upset that I agreed

505
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,030
我答应为格雷森家工作到
to stay and work with the Graysons

506
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,700
丹尼尔的电视访谈结束
through Daniel's television interview.

507
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,140
从后天起  我应该就可以
I should be able to start full-time

508
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,560
全心全意为您工作了
the day after tomorrow.

509
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,750
恐怕我不能
I'm afraid that offer

510
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,560
给你这个机会了  阿什莉
is no longer on the table, Ashley.

511
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,550
为什么
Why?

512
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:39,670
维多利亚提醒我  你颇有心机
Victoria warned me you were a little tricky,

513
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,290
于是我做了些调查
so I did some digging,

514
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,660
发现是你给媒体泄露了那些丹尼尔的照片
and I know you leaked those photos of Daniel to the press.

515
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,780
任何人处在我的位置都会这么做
I did what anyone would do.

516
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,900
不违反点规则  怎能从维多利亚・格雷森
You can't get beyond working for someone like Victoria Grayson

517
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,890
这种人手心里跳出去
without breaking a few rules.

518
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,340
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

519
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:56,420
我要花大把时间甄别客户的谎言
I waste enough time sifting through my clients' lies.

520
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:01,060
实在没兴趣再跟我的雇员玩这一套
I have no interest in doing the same with my employees.

521
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,770
格雷森家
Grayson.

522
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,360
联邦探员在这里  格雷森先生
The feds are here, Mr. Grayson.

523
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:15,420
联邦探员  他们想怎样
The feds? What do they want?

524
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:18,010
他们有搜查令  要进来全面搜查
They came with a warrant to seize everything.

525
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,850
全面搜查  这是什么意思
What do you mean, everything?

526
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,830
是谁批准的
By whose authority?

527
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,640
是美国人民批准的
By the authority of the people of the United States.

528
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,880
我是证交会的探员麦高恩  格雷森先生
This is agent McGowen of the S.E.C., Mr. Grayson.

529
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:29,160
我建议您明早留出时间
I suggest you set aside tomorrow morning

530
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,630
来一趟联邦大厦
to come down to the federal building

531
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,150
回答一些相关问题
and answer some questions.

532
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,920
您可能会需要律师随行
You're gonna want to bring your lawyer.

533
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:47,590
丹尼尔
Daniel.

534
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,360
我以为你还在家里休息呢
I thought you'd still be home sleeping.

535
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,380
我觉得我休息得够久了
I think I've been asleep long enough.

536
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,880
过来
Come here.

537
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,420
你还戴着它呢
You're still wearing it.

538
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,180
当然
Of course I am.

539
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,930
怎么  你反悔了
Why, are you having second thoughts?

540
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,950
我以为你会反悔
I thought you might be.

541
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,510
时过境迁了
So much has changed.

542
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,570
我不觉得
Not to me.

543
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:23,280
如果那些抗议的人是对的呢
What if those protesters were right?

544
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,460
如果我不该被释放呢
What if I didn't deserve that reprieve?

545
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,790
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

546
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,470
如果李・莫伦
What if Lee Moran

547
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,970
根本与泰勒的死无关呢
had nothing to do with Tyler's death?

548
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:34,420
我不懂你的意思
I don't understand.

549
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,560
一个胆大包天的职业罪犯
Why would a career criminal who's bold enough

550
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,480
又是勒索我父母  又是栽赃陷害我
to extort my parents and set me up for murder

551
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:41,020
怎么会突然良心发现呢
suddenly have a crisis of conscience?

552
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:44,190
谁知道呢  或许幡然悔悟了吧
I don't know. Maybe he finally realized he was in over his head.

553
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,580
或许吧
Maybe.

554
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,470
我决定接受明天那个访谈
I decided to do that interview tomorrow.

555
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:52,080
是吗
You did?

556
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:55,620
我真为你骄傲
I'm so proud of you.

557
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:00,360
父母把我当做格雷森家的顶梁柱来培养
My parents raised me to be a Grayson,

558
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,160
希望我有能力掌控一切
to put my name before everything,

559
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,670
包括真相
including the truth.

560
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:08,170
你不必这样勉强自己  丹尼尔
You don't need to be that guy, Daniel.

561
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,390
也许这次访谈是让你坦然面对一切的机会
Maybe this interview's an opportunity for you to be honest,

562
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,320
帮你脱离家族的光环
separate yourself from your name.

563
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,180
如果这能让你和父母之间产生
And if it creates a bit of healthy distance

564
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:15,940
一定的距离
from your parents,

565
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,270
那也是有益无害的
then all the better.

566
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:32,810
我去收拾行李
I'll go grab my stuff.

567
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:33,800
好
Okay.

568
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:45,420
还没睡吗
You're still up?

569
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,280
我以为你去艾米莉家了
I thought you'd gone to Emily's.

570
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:51,070
我回来拿东西
I came back to pick up my things,

571
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,930
看你灯还亮着
saw your light was on.

572
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,110
你还好吗
You all right?

573
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,200
不好
Uh, no.

574
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,740
我不是一般的
I am most definitely

575
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,220
糟
not all right.

576
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:08,960
很高兴你回来了
It's nice to have you back,

577
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,970
但我们家正处在
but our family is on the verge

578
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,090
灾难边缘  丹尼尔
of absolute catastrophe, Daniel.

579
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,570
我以房子打赌  前提是房子还归我所有
And I'd bet the house, if my name were still on it,

580
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:19,160
你妈和这事脱不了关系
that your mother has everything to do with that.

581
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,000
够了  爸爸
That's enough, dad.

582
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,610
我已经厌倦
I'm sick and tired of the two of you

583
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:23,060
你们之间的争斗了
playing me against the other.

584
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,900
可以理解
That's understandable.

585
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,910
在我们这段残破的婚姻中
You've been a pawn in our decrepit marriage

586
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:30,880
你一直就像个抵押品
for far too long.

587
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,420
我欠你一句道歉
I-I owe you an apology.

588
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,380
不  你欠我的是真相
No, what you owe me is the truth.

589
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:42,900
真相
The truth.

590
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:45,650
你知道为什么法官
Do you know why the judge

591
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:47,780
会如此慷慨  允许你家中软禁
so kindly granted you house arrest

592
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:50,510
而不是关在监狱受罪吗
instead of keeping you at Rikers?

593
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:52,980
知道  因为我差点被打死
Yeah, I nearly got beat to death.

594
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:57,360
你也知道是你妈雇人
And do you also know that your mother paid someone

595
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,820
安排了那次暴打吗
to arrange that beating?

596
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,910
李・莫伦
Lee Moran.

597
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,250
没错
Yeah.

598
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:22,060
他的认罪书不是真的  对吗
The confession he wrote wasn't real, was it?

599
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,390
不是真的
No.

600
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,340
告诉我  他不是你杀的
Tell me you didn't have him killed.

601
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,090
他知道的太多了
No, the kid was in too deep.

602
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,600
-爸  - 如果他把我们供出来
- Dad, come on. - If he'd started talking,

603
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,980
-我们都完蛋了  -我的天啊
- he would've destroyed us all. - Oh, come on.

604
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,350
我不能坐以待毙
I couldn't let that happen.

605
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,470
我只是保护我的家庭
I do what I need to do to protect the family.

606
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:40,080
一如既往
I always have.

607
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,660
你还做过什么
What did you do?

608
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:49,220
在我告诉你之前  你得向我保证一件事
Before I tell you, I need you to promise one thing...

609
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,960
如果最后我不幸获罪
That when they finally come to get me,

610
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,290
你要不惜一切重建公司
that you will do whatever you can to rebuild the company

611
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:56,880
并且照顾好你妹妹
and take care of your little sister.

612
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,410
我答应你
I promise.

613
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,580
你能去把门关上吗
Would you close the doors?

614
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:14,300
格雷森府邸  康拉德房间

615
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,580
要把这个故事讲清楚
In order for any of this to make sense,

616
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,350
我必须从一开始
I need to start at the beginning...

617
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,710
从我们对大卫・克拉克
With David Clarke

618
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:21,440
和他无辜的女儿所犯下罪行讲起
and what we did to him and his innocent baby girl.

619
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:33,240
夏洛特
Charlotte.

620
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,160
妈不管你想说什么  我都没时间听
Whatever you want, mom, I don't have time.

621
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,770
我上学快迟到了
I'm already late for school.

622
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:42,820
我刚和校长通过电话
I just got off the phone with the headmaster.

623
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,920
他告诉我 你被勒令停学了
He told me about the suspension.

624
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,930
我猜我们可以在格雷森家丑薄上
I guess we can add "Teen pill popper"

625
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:52,330
再添上一笔"少年毒瘾"
to the Grayson book of shame.

626
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,450
夏洛特  这没什么好笑的
This is no laughing matter, Charlotte.

627
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,230
你看见我笑了吗
Do you see me laughing?

628
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,380
我看得出你很痛苦
I see you in pain.

629
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,900
你拒我于千里之外  让我如何帮你呢
How can I help you if you don't let me?

630
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:11,470
我向你寻求过帮助  妈妈  你并不在意
I tried to let you, mom. You weren't interested.

631
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:15,290
不管你想找什么答案
Whatever answers you're looking for,

632
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,970
嗑药是没用的
you are not going to find them in a bottle of pills.

633
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:19,800
当然读这些垃圾
And you're not certainly not going to find them

634
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,190
也不能帮到你
reading this trash.

635
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,740
你从哪儿找到的这张照片
Where'd you get this?

636
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,850
我求你告诉我有关爸爸的事
I begged you to tell me about my father,

637
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:36,710
你断然拒绝
and you refused.

638
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,000
所以我只能自己去找
I had to go searching... on my own.

639
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,060
亲爱的
Oh, sweetheart.

640
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:46,870
这就是你嗑药的原因吗
Is this why you started taking drugs?

641
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,690
我不知道  妈妈  我微积分不合格
I don't know, mom. I'm failing calculus.

642
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:52,270
你自己算吧
You do the math.

643
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,870
气色不错
Looking good.

644
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,240
昨晚我好想你
I missed you last night.

645
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:10,640
对不起
I'm sorry. I...

646
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,330
我回到家后
I didn't realize how tired I still was

647
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,730
才感觉到自己有多累
until I got over here.

648
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,540
谢谢你如此善解人意
Thanks for being so understanding.

649
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,350
想好怎么应对
Have you thought any more about how you want to handle

650
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,070
这个访谈了吗
the interview?

651
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,040
满脑子都在想
It's all I can think about.

652
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,190
丹尼尔  我明白
Daniel, I know it's a lot.

653
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:31,300
你常说  你想做自己
You talk so much about wanting to be your own man--

654
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:34,010
要是我向往的自己不如我体内的遗传呢
What if the man I am is no better than my D.N.A.?

655
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:37,660
如实陈述真相将帮你从中解脱
Setting the record straight will help you break free from that.

656
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,380
如果你真的不想
If you truly don't want to follow

657
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,300
追随父母的脚步
in your parents' footsteps,

658
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:43,060
那就忠于自己的心
then don't.

659
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,220
刚才那话我当没听见
I'll try not to take offense at that remark.

660
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:51,370
我想跟儿子单独谈谈
A word with my son, please.

661
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,230
我在外面等你
I'll see you out there, okay?

662
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:02,200
现在我真是怀念
How I long for the days before Emily Thorne

663
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,940
艾米莉和她自以为是的愤慨
and her self-righteous indignation

664
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,960
未闯入我们生活之前的日子
became part of our daily lives.

665
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,640
不过她很快就会明白的
Well, she'll learn soon enough.

666
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:12,890
满口仁义道德的弊端在于
The downside of taking that kind of moral high ground

667
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,930
你有的是机会咬到自己的舌头
is that you have a lot farther to fall.

668
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:18,590
妈妈
Mom...

669
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:22,690
为什么法官会允许我家庭监禁
Why did the judge grant me house arrest

670
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:24,560
而不是把我关在监狱
rather than keep me in prison?

671
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,880
你的安全受到威胁  这你知道的
Your safety was at risk. You know that.

672
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,540
你和这事无关对吗
And you had nothing to do with it?

673
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:32,380
我的担心是对的
My suspicions were right.

674
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,700
你还没准备好面对媒体
You're not ready to talk to a reporter.

675
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,150
我去取消这次访谈
I'm going to cancel the interview.

676
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,200
我不会对你加以指责
I'm not gonna judge you.

677
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,330
我就想从你口中听到实情
Just tell me your side of the story.

678
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,250
是谁给你灌输了这些疯狂的想法
Who has been putting these crazy ideas into your head?

679
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:44,920
是艾米莉吗
Is it Emily?

680
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,490
你爸爸
Your father?

681
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,580
告诉我  他是一派胡言
Just tell me he's wrong.

682
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:55,600
抱歉打扰下
Sorry to interrupt.

683
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,280
丹尼尔  他们准备好了 
Daniel, they're ready for you.

684
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,850
丹尼尔
So, Daniel,

685
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,010
48小时前  你在监狱
48 hours ago, you were in jail

686
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:27,010
面对一级谋杀的指控
facing a murder one charge.

687
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:30,090
现在你重获自由  感觉如何
Now you're a free man. How you doing?

688
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,360
比我48小时前好多了
A lot better than I was 48 hours ago.

689
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,870
再问一次
Just for the record,

690
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:39,480
是你杀了泰勒・巴罗吗
did you murder Tyler Barrol?

691
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:41,750
泰勒威胁我的家人
Tyler threatened my whole family.

692
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,550
为了争夺手枪  我俩扭打在一起
We struggled for control of the gun,

693
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,230
枪走火了
It went off, and...

694
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:47,700
接下来我只知道  我被杀手
The next thing I knew, I was knocked out

695
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,300
-打倒了  -就是李・莫伦
- by the guy who finished the job. - Lee Moran.

696
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,280
照他的认罪书来看  的确如此
According to his confession.

697
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:53,830
但事实是
But the truth is,

698
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:55,260
我完全不知当时在海滩
I'll never know Exactly what happened

699
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,220
李和泰勒之间到底发生了什么
between Lee and Tyler on that beach.

700
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:58,890
我只知道这个事件的结局
I only know how it ended.

701
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:01,880
昨天我从新闻上看到你被释放了
We saw your release from Rikers on the news yesterday.

702
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:05,110
"占领丹尼尔"现在成了推特热门词
"Occupy Daniel" was even trending on twitter.

703
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,890
对于公众的反应  甚至对你的恶意抨击
Are you surprised not only by the public reaction

704
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:10,740
你感到惊讶吗
but by the vitriol directed at you?

705
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,250
一方面  我很惊讶
On--on one hand, yes.

706
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,670
但另一方面  我表示理解
But on the other, I- I get it.

707
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:17,080
人们觉得自身权利受到损害
People feel disenfranchised and fed up

708
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,710
也受够了那些享特权的少数人
with the privileged minority

709
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:21,120
好像他们遵守的是自己定的一套规则
who seem to abide by their own set of rules.

710
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,600
如果有人犯了罪
Listen, if anyone commits a crime,

711
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,870
不论是谁
no matter who you are,

712
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:27,530
都该为此付出代价
he or she should pay for it.

713
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,280
说起这个...
Speaking of which...

714
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:32,480
证交会已经下令
The S.E.C. has issued an order of investigation

715
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,400
调查你的家族企业
of your family's company, Grayson Global,

716
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:37,950
你未来将继承的格雷森国际
a company you stand to inherit.

717
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,140
你对这些
Would you like to comment

718
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:42,090
贪污诈骗的指控作何看法
on the allegations of corruption and fraud?

719
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,100
我的父亲是这起莫须有调查的受害者
My father is the victim of a witch hunt.

720
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,980
证交会几个月来一直在骚扰我们的公司
The S.E.C. has been harassing my family's company for months

721
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:57,780
现在竟试图利用
and is now attempting to trade

722
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,770
公众对我的怀疑
on the mistrust the public has of me

723
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,190
而对公司提出毫无根据的指控
to build a baseless case against it.

724
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:07,190
我那案子  真相最终大白
In my case, the truth came out.

725
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:11,930
我父亲这次也会如此
The same will be true for my father...

726
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,140
我将以儿子的身份支持他
who I stand behind as a son

727
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:18,530
以工作伙伴的身份协助他
and beside as a partner in business

728
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:22,050
为以后领导格雷森国际做好准备
as I prepare for my role at Grayson Global.

729
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,090
我不知道该说什么
I hardly know what to say.

730
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:33,940
谢谢
Thank you.

731
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,280
这就是你的计划吗
So that's your plan,

732
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,850
回到格雷森国际工作
to go back to Grayson Global?

733
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:41,440
没人说我不能既做自己
Well, no one said I can't be my own man

734
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,250
又做我父亲的儿子
and be my father's son.

735
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,580
说的是
That you are.

736
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,730
丹尼尔  请你过来签下这个
Daniel, I need you to sign this.

737
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,580
亲爱的  穿好你的大衣
Sweetheart, get your coat.

738
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:59,170
怎么了  你要带我去哪里
Why? Where are you taking me?

739
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,770
离开之前都不说声再见吗
You're not leaving without saying good-bye.

740
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:05,650
再见  格雷森先生
Good-bye, Mr. Grayson.

741
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:07,120
那别忘了这个
Well, don't forget this...

742
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:10,880
你雷克萨斯车的钥匙
the key to your new Lexus GS.

743
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,000
你说什么
Excuse me?

744
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,650
你可以开着它永远地离开汉普顿
You can either drive this out of the Hamptons forever

745
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:19,380
也可以把它停在格雷森国际里你的新车位上
or you can drive it to your new parking space at Grayson Global.

746
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,440
我不能代表布鲁克斯
I can't speak for Brooks,

747
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,220
但我个人敬佩那些
but I for one admire someone who doesn't mind

748
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,990
不惜脏了自己手的人
getting her hands dirty.

749
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:34,250
只要你明白从现在起
As long as you understand that from this point forward,

750
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,610
我们可就是一条船上的人了
our hands will be intertwined.

751
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,040
那维多利亚怎么办
And what about Victoria?

752
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,180
维多利亚和你一样还没明白
What both you and Victoria have yet to grasp

753
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:46,940
她对任何人来说
is just how little she matters...

754
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:49,140
都不重要
to anyone.

755
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,280
不能再去上柯林斯预科学校了
so no more Collins prep.

756
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:57,100
是的  她让她爸撤走了我的学费
No, she told her dad to pull my tuition.

757
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,410
我什么都不能做
There's nothing I can do.

758
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:00,340
我倒是可以做点什么
There is something I can do.

759
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,830
诺兰  等等
Nolan, Nolan, wait.

760
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:04,330
别说了
No, stop.

761
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:06,240
杰克  我想这么做
Jack, I want to do this.

762
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,830
很久以前
Once upon a time ago,

763
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:09,730
我非常幸运
I was lucky enough to...

764
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:12,740
能在我最需要的时候获得他人的帮助
have someone take care of me when I needed it.

765
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,210
我非常感激
Look, I appreciate that,

766
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:15,590
但我们应该借此机会
but we should be taking this opportunity

767
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:16,780
摆脱格雷森一家
to get away from the Graysons.

768
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,820
没错
Exactly.

769
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,110
你说自己不愿让德克兰
You said you didn't want Declan

770
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:21,370
花格雷森家的钱去读柯林斯预科学校
to go to Collins prep on the Graysons' dime.

771
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:23,210
现在他不用了
So now he won't be.

772
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,810
但他理应像其他人那样
He still deserves an overpriced education

773
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:27,410
得到奢侈的高质量教育  不是吗
like everyone else, no?

774
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,550
巴里  我的老伙计...
Barry, my man...

775
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:35,740
我需要你给柯林斯预科学校
I need you to cut a check

776
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,270
开张支票
to Collins prep.

777
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:43,440
每当我回到这里
Every time I come back here,

778
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:44,850
顷刻涌出的回忆
my memories always rush back

779
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:46,870
将我带回听见他死讯的那一刻
to the moment I heard he died.

780
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,010
我最后悔的事便是...
And the first regret I had...

781
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:52,810
我没让他见过你
is how I held you from him.

782
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,000
他永远都没有机会  让你们彼此了解
He would never get a chance to know you or you him.

783
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:00,850
夏洛特  随便你怎么想我
You can despise me all you want, Charlotte,

784
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,320
但你的父亲
but your father...

785
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:04,180
他是个好人
he was a good man.

786
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,260
他犯了一个错误
He made one mistake

787
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,470
使自己陷入万劫不复的深渊
that led him down a path of destruction.

788
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,010
看来这是我们之间的共同点
I guess we have that in common.

789
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,550
你身上有太多与他相似之处
There are so many things about you

790
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:16,210
会唤起我对他的记忆
that remind me of him...

791
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,040
你的眼睛
Your eyes,

792
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,380
你的笑声
your laugh.

793
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,100
你爱我吗
Do you love me...

794
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:28,710
即使每次都是透过我  你都会想起他
even though every time you look at me, you think of him?

795
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,700
夏洛特  你还不懂吗
Charlotte, don't you get it?

796
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:36,980
正因如此  我才更加地爱你
It's because of that that I love you all the more.

797
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,970
妈妈  有人来过这里
Mom, somebody's been here.

798
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,160
艾米丽
Emily.

799
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,260
你还好吗
You okay?

800
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,260
我想喝杯酒
I could use a drink.

801
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,890
要点什么吗
Anything in particular?

802
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,660
老板说了算
Dealer's choice.

803
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,810
那我去后面拿好酒出来
I'll go get the good stuff from the back.

804
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,460
今天不太顺吗
Rough day at the office?

805
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,440
他变成一丘之貉了  诺兰
He's one of them, Nolan.

806
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:20,800
康拉德在采访前  向丹尼尔坦白了一切
Conrad confessed everything to Daniel before the interview.

807
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,770
所有的一切吗
"Everything" everything?

808
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,670
丹尼尔本可以讲出所有实情
Daniel could've come clean.

809
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:28,170
他本可以...
He could've...

810
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:30,270
结束一切的是是非非
ended the whole thing.

811
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:32,030
但相反...
But instead...

812
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:34,010
他和格雷森同流合污了
He doubled down on Grayson.

813
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,360
那现在你准备怎么办
So what are you gonna do now?

814
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:42,930
我准备嫁给他
I'm gonna marry him.

815
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:48,000
查出杀害我父亲的凶手
I'm gonna track down the man who killed my father.

816
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:52,440
找到他以后  你准备怎么办
And what are you gonna do when you find him?

817
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:56,450
杀了他
I'm gonna kill him.

818
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,390
赦免是洗净罪孽的圣水
Absolution is the washing away of sin...

819
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:08,150
是赋予重生的承诺
the promise of rebirth...

820
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:17,210
是先人逃脱罪责的机会
and the chance to escape the transgressions of those who came before us.

821
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:24,930
我们中的智者从过去吸取教训
The best among us will learn from the mistakes of the past,

822
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:28,530
然后余下的凡人注定重蹈覆辙
while the rest seem doomed to repeat them.

823
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:31,370
实际上
Well, the truth is,

824
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:33,980
我以前很欣赏大卫・克拉克
I always liked David Clarke.

825
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:38,230
他可靠  有效率  还很幽默
He was reliable, efficient, good-humored.

826
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,580
我想  他不留破绽地
I suppose the fact that

827
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,580
在这里与大家共事
he fit in so seamlessly around here

828
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:45,110
正是他如此危险的原因
is what made him so dangerous.

829
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,230
很抱歉  格雷森先生  但那人又来了
I'm sorry, Mr. Grayson, but that man's here again.

830
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,750
而且执意要见你
He won't take no for an answer.

831
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:52,740
今天就到这里吧  特德韦尔先生
That'll be all for today, Mr. Treadwell.

832
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:03,760
而那些游走于社会边缘之人
And then there are those who operate on the fringes of society...

833
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:08,350
会冲破道德的底线  卸下良知的包袱
unburdened by the confines or morality and conscience...

834
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,860
一种残忍的野兽
A ruthless breed of monsters

835
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,440
其最致命的武器是
whose deadliest weapon is their ability

836
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,540
在开阔的视野里隐藏自己
to hide in plain sight.

837
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,490
如果那些我要审判的罪人
If the people I've come to bring justice to

838
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:27,660
无意于寻求赦免
cannot be bound by the quest for absolution...

839
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:31,010
我亦不会手下留情
Then neither will I.
