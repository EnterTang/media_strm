是不是既温暖又干燥
{\fs14}is it warm and dry?{\r}

41
00:05:22,228 --> 00:05:26,376
没有特别宏伟 而且有些潮湿
{\fs14}It's not that grand. And it's damp.{\r}

42
00:05:28,574 --> 00:05:30,995

{\fs14}We couldn't afford to maintain the dykes.{\r}

43
00:05:31,104 --> 00:05:35,925
血统一文不值
{\fs14}Pedigree counts for nothing. Nothing.{\r}

44
00:05:38,207 --> 00:05:41,735
没有堤坝 水就会漫涌而来

家里没有糖
{\fs14}We do not keep sugar in the house.{\r}

53
00:06:08,757 --> 00:06:11,385

听好了 我的女儿
{\fs14}Now you listen to me, my girl.{\r}

57
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:50,487
你必须要嫁给他
{\fs14}You need to marry him.{\r}

58
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:53,894
必须让他娶你 不然我们就完了
{\fs14}You need to make him want to marry you, otherwise we are ruined.{\r}

59
00:06:53,991 --> 00:06:56,446
我倒是无所谓 但你的弟弟妹妹
{\fs14}For myself, I don't care. But for your brother and sister...{\r}

66
00:07:25,295 --> 00:07:27,924

{\fs14}I know I was not the only one you wrote to.{\r}

67
00:07:28,042 --> 00:07:30,529
如果不是走投无路 您也不会这样做吧
{\fs14}You would not have done so had you not been desperate.{\r}

68
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:33,794

{\fs14}Do you think you could love him?{\r}

72
00:07:47,084 --> 00:07:48,212
有什么区别吗
{\fs14}Does it make a difference?{\r}

73
00:07:48,275 --> 00:07:50,756
没有 但是我想让你幸福
{\fs14}No. But I want you to be happy.{\r}

74
00:07:52,466 --> 00:07:56,291
可能会吧

{\fs14}It would have looked better if you'd been here when she arrived.{\r}

79

{\fs14}We are eating frugally today to demonstrate humility.{\r}

102
00:11:12,053 --> 00:11:14,138

{\fs14}This house is evidence enough, no?{\r}

116
00:11:42,517 --> 00:11:45,151
你跟弗兰斯・密尔曼斯谈过他妻子的糖了吗
{\fs14}Have you spoken to Frans Meermans yet about his wife's sugar?{\r}

117
00:11:45,217 --> 00:11:46,451
她在这儿等着我呢
{\fs14}So that's what this is about.{\r}

118
00:11:46,556 --> 00:11:48,841

{\fs14}It's been sitting in the warehouse for a month.{\r}

119
00:11:48,931 --> 00:11:50,713

121
00:11:53,349 --> 00:11:55,257

{\fs14}but of all the things I might sell, she pushes this.{\r}

122
00:11:55,337 --> 00:11:56,003
你有什么看法呢

卖了那些糖
{\fs14}Sell the sugar!{\r}

124
00:11:56,977 --> 00:11:58,631

{\fs14}Don't tell me what to do!{\r}

125
00:12:06,925 --> 00:12:07,884
你要去哪
{\fs14}Where are you going?{\r}

126
00:12:07,969 --> 00:12:09,033
去看看你说的那些破糖
{\fs14}To check on your damned sugar!{\r}

127
00:12:09,077 --> 00:12:10,527
我不相信你
{\fs14}I don't believe you.{\r}

128
00:12:21,064 --> 00:12:22,271
你好

129
00:12:30,798 --> 00:12:33,111
这是约翰尼斯航行途中收集的吗
{\fs14}Did Johannes collect these on his travels?{\r}

130
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:35,394
整个世界蕴含在这一套盘子中
{\fs14}The world in a set of plates.{\r}

131
00:12:36,204 --> 00:12:38,638
他这么富有 应该可以雇人替他航行吧
{\fs14}Isn't he rich enough to have someone travel for him?{\r}

132
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:42,696
庄园主的灵魂属于海洋
{\fs14}The Seigneur's spirit belongs on the seas.{\r}

133
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:45,606
他说陆地永远都比不上海洋
{\fs14}He says the ocean is something the land can never be.{\r}

134
00:12:46,144 --> 00:12:48,203
每一滴海水都是独一无二的存在
{\fs14}No patch ever stays the same.{\r}

135
00:12:49,022 --> 00:12:50,662
你们在干什么
{\fs14}What are you doing?{\r}

136
00:12:51,822 --> 00:12:53,454
聊聊而已
{\fs14}Only talking.{\r}

{\fs14}He's working. Can't you see?{\r}

138
00:12:57,373 --> 00:13:00,770
这里不用管了 有些画卷要你去送
{\fs14}Leave that. There are scrolls you need to deliver.{\r}

139
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,223
玛琳 比波应该是想我了
{\fs14}Marin, I think Peebo misses me.{\r}

140
00:13:11,341 --> 00:13:13,589
他需要呼吸一下新鲜空气 见见阳光
{\fs14}He needs fresh air and light.{\r}

141
00:13:13,707 --> 00:13:15,013
他的活动范围仅限于这里
{\fs14}His place is down here.{\r}

142
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:16,290
可是约翰尼斯的狗就能
{\fs14}But Johannes's dog...{\r}

143
00:13:16,364 --> 00:13:19,730
约翰尼斯是庄园主 他可以为所欲为
{\fs14}Johannes is the Seigneur. He may do as he pleases.{\r}

144
00:13:21,406 --> 00:13:23,133
他一直都这么忙吗
{\fs14}Is he away a great deal?{\r}

145
00:13:34,367 --> 00:13:37,364
没人逼你嫁给他
{\fs14}Nobody forced you to marry him.{\r}

146
00:13:40,048 --> 00:13:42,481
希望你不会失望
{\fs14}I hope you are not disappointed.{\r}

147
00:13:43,352 --> 00:13:46,842
我也没有想要办婚宴
{\fs14}I have no need of a wedding feast.{\r}

148
00:13:51,562 --> 00:13:53,253
很高兴我娶到了你
{\fs14}I'm glad it's you.{\r}

149
00:13:53,798 --> 00:13:58,169
约翰尼斯 我知道我们彼此还不了解
{\fs14}Johannes, I know we barely know each other.{\r}

150
00:14:00,068 --> 00:14:03,549
但我保证 会努力成为一个好妻子
{\fs14}But I promise I will try to make you a good wife.{\r}

151
00:14:04,147 --> 00:14:06,599
我也答应你 等你来到阿姆斯特丹
{\fs14}And I give you my word, when you come to Amsterdam{\r}

152
00:14:06,706 --> 00:14:09,308
我会尽最大的努力 成为一个好丈夫
{\fs14}I will do everything I am able to be a good husband.{\r}

153
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:17,354
我在这个城里还有些急事
{\fs14}I have urgent business in the city.{\r}

154
00:14:18,003 --> 00:14:21,885
不在这里过我们的洞房花烛夜吗
{\fs14}I thought you would want to spend our first night... here.{\r}

155
00:14:22,856 --> 00:14:25,039
我也希望如此

156

约翰尼斯
{\fs14}Johannes...{\r}

159
00:15:05,493 --> 00:15:09,612
我就想问一句 一会儿
{\fs14}I just wondered, will I{\r}

160
00:15:09,716 --> 00:15:13,351

00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,858
还等什么 快请进
{\fs14}Well, what you waiting for? Come in!{\r}

247
00:21:11,442 --> 00:21:13,676
夫人 请四处瞧瞧
{\fs14}Please Madame, have a look around.{\r}

248
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:20,077
密尔曼斯夫妇坚持让庄园主当他们的经销商
{\fs14}The Meermans insisted the Seigneur distribute it.{\r}

249
00:21:20,128 --> 00:21:21,877
他们知道 他能以更高的价格出口
{\fs14}They know he can get a better price abroad.{\r}

250
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:25,044
夫人完全赞成 虽然她不喜欢糖
{\fs14}And Madame's all for it, even though she hates sugar.{\r}

251
00:21:25,044 --> 00:21:26,966
她和其他扫兴鬼都不喜欢糖
{\fs14}Her and all the rest of the killjoys!{\r}

252
00:21:27,009 --> 00:21:30,069
我听说 他们要像禁止天主教徒一样禁止姜饼人
{\fs14}I heard a rumour they want to ban gingerbread men as papist...{\r}

253
00:21:30,115 --> 00:21:31,254
简直荒谬至极
{\fs14}can you believe that?{\r}

254
00:21:33,139 --> 00:21:35,229
夫人 想吃什么尽管尝
{\fs14}Madame, try anything you like.{\r}

255
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,484
干嘛不在本地卖 这里都快供不应求了
{\fs14}Why not sell it here? There's barely enough to go round.{\r}

256
00:21:40,739 --> 00:21:42,519
很快就会来更多了
{\fs14}I think there's more going on.{\r}

257
00:21:43,006 --> 00:21:44,889
更多 你什么意思
{\fs14}More? What would you mean...?{\r}

258
00:21:46,207 --> 00:21:49,092
汉娜 你在干嘛
{\fs14}Hanna! What are you doing, woman?{\r}

259
00:21:49,534 --> 00:21:52,701
我要走了 以后见 小菊
{\fs14}I must go. I'll see you soon, Cornflower.{\r}

260
00:22:00,117 --> 00:22:01,102
就是这里
{\fs14}There it is.{\r}

261
00:22:03,641 --> 00:22:04,876
太阳的标志
{\fs14}The sign of the sun.{\r}

262
00:22:05,522 --> 00:22:06,956
以前从没注意到呢
{\fs14}I've never noticed that before...{\r}

263
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,295
你好
{\fs14}Hello?{\r}

264
00:22:13,956 --> 00:22:15,014
有人在吗
{\fs14}Hello?{\r}

265
00:22:35,335 --> 00:22:36,271
夫人
{\fs14}Madame!{\r}

266
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:38,306
那里可没有人 夫人
{\fs14}I don't think there's anyone here, Madame.{\r}

267
00:22:57,716 --> 00:22:59,183
橱柜去哪儿了
{\fs14}What happened to the cabinet?{\r}

268
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:19,450
不能放在门厅里 把光线都挡住了
{\fs14}It couldn't stay in the hallway. It was taking up all the light.{\r}

269
00:23:48,118 --> 00:23:50,086
奥托 科妮莉亚 有人敲门
{\fs14}Otto, Cornelia, the door.{\r}

270
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,542
你好
{\fs14}Hello.{\r}

271
00:24:08,638 --> 00:24:10,001
你在这做什么
{\fs14}What the hell are you doing here?{\r}

272
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,935
有个包裹 是寄给内拉・奥尔特曼的
{\fs14}A package. For Nella Oortman.{\r}

273
00:24:14,298 --> 00:24:15,868
这是你的新婚妻子
{\fs14}So, this is your new wife?{\r}

274
00:24:18,953 --> 00:24:20,458

275
00:24:21,784 --> 00:24:24,325
下回走佣人入口
{\fs14}Next time use the lower entrance.{\r}

276
00:24:27,295 --> 00:24:28,724
他是谁 庄园主
{\fs14}Who was it, Seigneur?{\r}

277
00:24:29,806 --> 00:24:31,332
没谁 奥托 没谁
{\fs14}No-one, Otto.No-one.{\r}

278
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,245
送货员而已
{\fs14}A delivery, that's all.{\r}

279
00:24:39,274 --> 00:24:40,976
包裹里有什么
{\fs14}What is it that's in the parcel?{\r}

280
00:24:42,541 --> 00:24:44,963
我为你送我的橱柜 添置了些小玩意
{\fs14}Just some things for the cabinet you bought me.{\r}

281
00:25:03,689 --> 00:25:07,476
每个女人都是自己命运的建筑师
{\fs14}"Every woman is the architect of her own fortune."{\r}

282
00:25:12,294 --> 00:25:14,967
物品 一把带弦的鲁特琴

先生 感谢你按要求为我定制的物品
{\fs14}Sir, I thank you for the items I requested.{\r}

286
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,495
你的手艺非同一般
{\fs14}Your craftsmanship is exceptional.{\r}

287
00:26:57,687 --> 00:26:59,466
然而我并未要求你制作一只摇篮
{\fs14}However, I made no request for a cradle,{\r}

288
00:26:59,504 --> 00:27:01,692
我也不理解 你为何想送我一只摇篮
{\fs14}nor do I understand why you would wish to send one.{\r}

289
00:27:02,093 --> 00:27:04,691
因此我将立刻终止交易
{\fs14}I must therefore curtail our transactions forthwith.{\r}

290
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:07,327
我诚心请求 佩特内拉・布兰特
{\fs14}Yours in good faith, Petronella Brandt.{\r}

291
00:27:15,862 --> 00:27:17,238
又给那个工匠吗
{\fs14}For the craftsman again?{\r}

292
00:27:17,262 --> 00:27:18,580
别打开
{\fs14}Don't open it.{\r}

293
00:27:18,926 --> 00:27:19,882
不会的 夫人
{\fs14}No, Madame.{\r}

294
00:27:26,969 --> 00:27:29,283
原来你在这 科妮莉亚去哪儿了
{\fs14}There you are. But where on earth is Cornelia?{\r}

295
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,695
你得开始准备了
{\fs14}You need to start getting ready.{\r}

296
00:27:30,736 --> 00:27:32,165
准备什么
{\fs14}Ready? For what?{\r}

297
00:27:32,532 --> 00:27:35,420
约翰尼斯打算带你去参加银器匠工会举办的宴会
{\fs14}Johannes is taking you to a feast at the Guild of Silversmiths.{\r}

298
00:27:35,446 --> 00:27:37,003
窗帘怎么拉上了
{\fs14}Why are the curtains closed?{\r}

299
00:27:37,494 --> 00:27:39,760
阳光太刺眼 仅此而已
{\fs14}The sunlight was too bright, that's all.{\r}

300
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,649
白天必须把窗帘全部拉开
{\fs14}We keep them open during the daylight.{\r}

301
00:27:47,444 --> 00:27:49,876
否则路人会以为我们在隐瞒什么秘密
{\fs14}Otherwise people will think we have something to hide.{\r}

302
00:27:51,395 --> 00:27:52,684
带我参加宴会
{\fs14}The feast.{\r}

303
00:27:54,938 --> 00:27:56,225
是他的主意吗
{\fs14}Was it his idea?{\r}

304
00:27:56,771 --> 00:27:59,139
我们一致认为带你去比较合适
{\fs14}We agreed it was appropriate you should attend.{\r}

305
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:10,120
你确定吗 那里依然没人
{\fs14}You're absolutely sure? There was no-one there again?{\r}

306
00:28:10,312 --> 00:28:12,185
我从门底下塞进去的
{\fs14}I slipped it under the door.{\r}

307
00:28:13,418 --> 00:28:15,084
汉娜向你问好
{\fs14}Hanna sends her greetings.{\r}

308
00:28:18,933 --> 00:28:20,494
你美极了
{\fs14}You look wonderful.{\r}

309
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:26,242
玛琳 这条裙子掷下的重金是值得的
{\fs14}See, Marin, all that money I spent on dresses was worth it after all.{\r}

310
00:28:29,224 --> 00:28:30,421
你为什么不来
{\fs14}Why aren't you coming?{\r}

311
00:28:30,612 --> 00:28:33,197
带妻子出席更好 不是吗
{\fs14}I think it is better you're seen with your wife, don't you?{\r}

312
00:28:34,738 --> 00:28:37,158
一定别忘了邀请密尔曼斯夫妇去吃晚餐
{\fs14}You must remember to invite the Meermans to dinner.{\r}

313
00:28:37,198 --> 00:28:39,053
知道了 内拉 我们走吧
{\fs14}Alright. Nella, let's go.{\r}

314
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:55,724
感谢你 带上我
{\fs14}Thank you... for bringing me.{\r}

315
00:28:57,477 --> 00:28:58,760
你没必要感谢我
{\fs14}You don't have to thank me.{\r}

316
00:29:00,616 --> 00:29:02,551
那我应该感谢谁
{\fs14}Then whom should I thank?{\r}

317
00:29:02,603 --> 00:29:04,212
你是我妻子
{\fs14}I mean, you're my wife.{\r}

318
00:29:05,108 --> 00:29:07,324
无论我带你去哪 你都不必感谢我
{\fs14}You shouldn't have to thank me for taking you somewhere.{\r}

319
00:29:09,478 --> 00:29:11,057
密尔曼斯夫妇也会到场吗
{\fs14}Will the Meermans be there?{\r}

320
00:29:12,353 --> 00:29:15,597
玛琳似乎很期待 你将弗兰斯・密尔曼斯的糖卖出去
{\fs14}Marin seems very keen for you to sell Frans Meermans's sugar.{\r}

321
00:29:16,491 --> 00:29:17,796
不是他的糖
{\fs14}It's not his.{\r}

322
00:29:20,263 --> 00:29:21,557
是他妻子的
{\fs14}It's his wife's.{\r}

323
00:29:23,492 --> 00:29:26,493
她将它视为实现梦想的手段
{\fs14}She sees it as a passport to what she's always wanted,{\r}

324
00:29:27,584 --> 00:29:30,488
弗兰斯无法给予她的权势和地位
{\fs14}the power and position Frans couldn't give her,{\r}

325
00:29:30,529 --> 00:29:33,183
但玛琳并不明白其中的复杂
{\fs14}but Marin doesn't understand the complications.{\r}

326
00:29:34,991 --> 00:29:36,628
什么复杂
{\fs14}Which are?{\r}

327
00:29:37,451 --> 00:29:41,175
他们一旦得到权势 就会失去控制
{\fs14}Exactly what he and Agnes will do with the power once they have it.{\r}

328
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:52,299
转过身去
{\fs14}Turn around.{\r}

329
00:30:02,088 --> 00:30:03,304
闭上眼睛
{\fs14}Close your eyes.{\r}

330
00:30:19,112 --> 00:30:21,480
只管微笑 不要说话
{\fs14}Smile, and don't say anything.{\r}

331
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,024
工会垄断贸易 制定价格
{\fs14}The Guilds have monopoly on trade, and set the prices.{\r}

332
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,208
不用理睬
{\fs14}Take no notice.{\r}

333
00:30:35,384 --> 00:30:37,558
银器匠极为富有
{\fs14}The silversmiths' is one of the richest.{\r}

334
00:30:37,646 --> 00:30:39,787
像我这样的商人 没有加入工会
{\fs14}For a merchant like me, who works outside the guilds,{\r}

335
00:30:39,859 --> 00:30:43,067
出席不只是出于尊重 更是义务
{\fs14}attendance is not simply a mark of respect, but a duty.{\r}

336
00:30:53,899 --> 00:30:54,963
给
{\fs14}Here.{\r}

337
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:14,954
你有没有想过 可以通过食物寻找本我
{\fs14}Did you ever think food is where we truly find ourselves?{\r}

338
00:31:17,024 --> 00:31:18,044
看见了吗
{\fs14}See this?{\r}

339
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:21,437
新做的干酪中有孜然种子
{\fs14}Cumin seeds studding in new cheese{\r}

340
00:31:21,558 --> 00:31:23,637
提醒着我可以开怀大笑
{\fs14}remind me I am capable of delight.{\r}

341
00:31:28,411 --> 00:31:32,659
德尔夫特黄油 美味且多乳脂
{\fs14}Delft butter, so fine and creamy...{\r}

342

无花果
{\fs14}Figs{\r}

343
00:31:39,275 --> 00:31:42,227
和酸奶油
{\fs14}and sour cream,{\r}

344
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,843
带我回到童年
{\fs14}taking me back to childhood,{\r}

345
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:50,579
是我现在唯一能记起的味道
{\fs14}only the taste of which I now remember.{\r}

346
00:31:55,061 --> 00:31:56,236
你呢
{\fs14}You?{\r}

347
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,532
我母亲以前常把杏仁糖做成蛋卷
{\fs14}My mother used to make marzipan into rolls.{\r}

348
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,692
那味道从厨房飘来
{\fs14}And the smell coming from the kitchen...{\r}

349
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,212
让我心跳加速
{\fs14}it made my heart race.{\r}

350
00:32:10,868 --> 00:32:12,076
比鲱鱼还好闻吗
{\fs14}Better than herrings?{\r}

351
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,908
你在海上吃什么

吃人
{\fs14}Other men.{\r}

353
00:32:36,431 --> 00:32:38,195
约翰尼斯 这边
{\fs14}Johannes! Over here!{\r}

354
00:32:40,927 --> 00:32:42,560
谈生意 不会太久
{\fs14}Business. Won't be long.{\r}

355
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:51,351
我看布兰特挑选妻子的标准
{\fs14}I see Brandt keeps the same standard of wife{\r}

356
00:32:51,407 --> 00:32:52,887
和他的行事风格一样
{\fs14}as he does everything else.{\r}

357

有时候我们在想 如果
{\fs14}Sometimes we wondered if...{\r}

363
00:33:17,251 --> 00:33:18,331
艾格尼丝 拜托
{\fs14}Agnes, please...{\r}

364
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,632
弗兰斯 这位是佩特内拉・布兰特
{\fs14}Frans, this is Petronella Brandt.{\r}

365
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,800
我以为她是银器匠呢
{\fs14}Oh, I thought she was a silversmith.{\r}

366
00:33:27,648 --> 00:33:29,350
约翰尼斯呢 我还以为有事要和他谈
{\fs14}Where's Johannes? I thought we were going to talk to him.{\r}

367
00:33:29,454 --> 00:33:30,484
他来了
{\fs14}Here he comes.{\r}

368
00:33:30,594 --> 00:33:31,538
密尔曼斯夫人
{\fs14}Madame Meermans.{\r}

369
00:33:31,874 --> 00:33:36,106
大人 你今晚也用了平时的魔法啊
{\fs14}Seigneur. I see you are working your usual magic this evening.{\r}

370
00:33:36,586 --> 00:33:38,234
没有魔法 夫人 只是我自己
{\fs14}No magic, Madame. Just me.{\r}

371
00:33:38,586 --> 00:33:40,034
是糖的事 约翰尼斯
{\fs14}About the sugar, Johannes.{\r}

372
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:41,842
我还在找买家
{\fs14}I have it in hand.{\r}

373
00:33:42,266 --> 00:33:44,834
我们从未怀疑过 只是
{\fs14}We never doubted. Only, er...{\r}

374
00:33:45,298 --> 00:33:46,738
你觉得什么时候能卖出去
{\fs14}when will it sell, do you think?{\r}

375
00:33:47,666 --> 00:33:49,370
获取最佳价格需要时间
{\fs14}To get the best price takes time.{\r}

376
00:33:49,634 --> 00:33:50,861
鉴于东方的黑市
{\fs14}What with the black markets in the east,{\r}

377
00:33:50,941 --> 00:33:53,098
和国内的背叛者 人们正在寻找好产品
{\fs14}and the adulterers at home, people are craving good product.{\r}

378
00:33:53,186 --> 00:33:54,882
但我不会把你的糖带去交易所
{\fs14}But I will not take your sugar to the bourse.{\r}

379
00:33:55,338 --> 00:33:57,513
交易大厅是个马戏团 市场被垄断了
{\fs14}The trading floor is a circus, the market rigged.{\r}

380
00:33:57,608 --> 00:33:59,024
你打算卖到国外吗
{\fs14}You intend to sell it abroad?{\r}

381
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,520
我不久要坐船去威尼斯了
{\fs14}I sail to Venice shortly.{\r}

382
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,744
天主教徒吗
{\fs14}Papists?{\r}

383
00:34:04,966 --> 00:34:05,797
当然 如果你乐意
{\fs14}Of course, if you prefer,{\r}

384
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,152
我们可以全扔去阿姆斯特丹
{\fs14}we could dump it all here in Amsterdam,{\r}

385
00:34:07,229 --> 00:34:09,358
供大于求 只获得真实价值的四分之一利润
{\fs14}flood the market, and realize only a quarter of its true value.{\r}

386
00:34:09,438 --> 00:34:10,494
如何选择完全在于你
{\fs14}The choice is entirely yours.{\r}

387
00:34:10,574 --> 00:34:11,926
你是行家
{\fs14}You're the expert.{\r}

388
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,660
没错 我是
{\fs14}Yes, I am.{\r}

389
00:34:14,732 --> 00:34:17,083
走吧 艾格尼丝 斯莱波特到了
{\fs14}Come, Agnes. There's Slabbaert.{\r}

390
00:34:17,123 --> 00:34:18,195
我们应该去问候一下
{\fs14}We should say hello.{\r}

391
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:20,635
上帝与你同在
{\fs14}God be with you.{\r}

392
00:34:22,979 --> 00:34:24,099
你也是
{\fs14}And you.{\r}

393
00:34:30,627 --> 00:34:31,598
他们是谁
{\fs14}Who are they?{\r}

394
00:34:32,827 --> 00:34:34,795
执法部门和船舶银行的官员
{\fs14}Schout and Schepenbank.{\r}

395
00:34:35,467 --> 00:34:36,995
即阿姆斯特丹的法官和陪审团
{\fs14}Judge and jury here in Amsterdam.{\r}

396
00:34:38,947 --> 00:34:40,251
他们为何那样看你
{\fs14}Why do they look at you like that?{\r}

397
00:34:41,059 --> 00:34:42,179
因为他们无法掌控我
{\fs14}Because they don't control me.{\r}

398
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:45,843
他们想要掌控你吗
{\fs14}Do they want to? Control you?{\r}

399
00:34:47,683 --> 00:34:51,899
不 他们想毁掉我
{\fs14}No. They want to destroy me.{\r}

400
00:35:00,747 --> 00:35:01,939
大家很钦佩你
{\fs14}People admire you.{\r}

401
00:35:03,422 --> 00:35:05,499
如果我不富有 你觉得他们会和我说话吗
{\fs14}Do you think they'd talk to me if I wasn't rich?{\r}

402
00:35:06,579 --> 00:35:09,443
我们富有吗
{\fs14}Are we? Rich?{\r}

403
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,643
你抓不住财富的 内拉
{\fs14}You cannot hold wealth, Nella.{\r}

404
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:19,028
财富就像大海 试图紧紧抓住
{\fs14}It's like the sea. Try to hold on to it too tightly,{\r}

405
00:35:19,105 --> 00:35:21,361
它只会如水般从手指间滑落
{\fs14}it'll slip through your fingers, like water.{\r}

406
00:35:23,385 --> 00:35:26,105
玛琳总是很担心
{\fs14}Marin loves to worry.{\r}

407
00:35:31,012 --> 00:35:32,199
你一定累了 去睡吧
{\fs14}You must be tired. Go to bed.{\r}

408
00:35:32,582 --> 00:35:37,622
我不累 约翰尼斯
{\fs14}I'm not tired, Johannes.{\r}

409
00:35:40,718 --> 00:35:47,063
但我得记下今晚见过的人
{\fs14}Still, I have to make notes on the men I met tonight.{\r}

410
00:36:04,811 --> 00:36:05,772
你想要什么
{\fs14}What do you want?{\r}

411
00:36:06,339 --> 00:36:08,187
你觉得呢 约翰尼斯
{\fs14}What do you think I want, Johannes?{\r}

412
00:36:11,299 --> 00:36:12,731
我想成为你的妻子
{\fs14}I want to be your wife.{\r}

413
00:36:13,667 --> 00:36:14,659
你是我妻子
{\fs14}You are my wife.{\r}

414
00:36:15,859 --> 00:36:22,331
不 据我所知 我只是你的附属品
{\fs14}No. As far as I can tell I'm just... someone you own.{\r}

415
00:36:24,675 --> 00:36:27,475
是对你有用的人 我只能如此猜测
{\fs14}Someone who's useful to you for purposes I can only guess at.{\r}

416
00:36:30,547 --> 00:36:35,181
跟你的狗 跟奥托一样  内拉 拜托
{\fs14}-Like a dog, like Otto. -Nella, please...{\r}

417
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:37,533
我来这里十一天了 约翰尼斯
{\fs14}I've been here eleven days, Johannes.{\r}

418
00:36:38,533 --> 00:36:40,693
比上帝创造世界的时间还长
{\fs14}Longer than it took God to make the world.{\r}

419
00:36:43,605 --> 00:36:45,421
今晚之前 你几乎没跟我说过话
{\fs14}Until tonight, you've barely spoken to me.{\r}

420
00:36:46,917 --> 00:36:50,533
你说得对 我很抱歉
{\fs14}You're right. I'm sorry.{\r}

421
00:36:51,989 --> 00:36:53,446
我会补偿你的
{\fs14}I'll make it up to you.{\r}

422
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,694
过来
{\fs14}Come.{\r}

423
00:37:56,575 --> 00:37:58,647
我有那么令你恶心吗
{\fs14}Do I disgust you that much?{\r}

424
00:37:59,175 --> 00:38:00,127
你没有让我感到恶心
{\fs14}You do not disgust me.{\r}

425
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:02,111
你都不让我碰你
{\fs14}You cannot bear me to touch you.{\r}

426
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:03,703
不是那样的
{\fs14}It's not that.{\r}

427
00:38:06,007 --> 00:38:09,872
我必须和她一起分享你 对吗
{\fs14}I have to share you with her. Is that it?{\r}

428
00:38:15,421 --> 00:38:16,061
在我们其中一人
{\fs14}I think you'd better leave{\r}

429
00:38:16,197 --> 00:38:17,991
说出后悔的话之前 你最好离开  不
{\fs14}-before one of us says something we both regret. -No,{\r}

430
00:38:18,082 --> 00:38:19,183
不 约翰尼斯 我知道
{\fs14}no Johannes, I know...{\r}

431
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:20,321
给我滚
{\fs14}Go. Get out!{\r}

432
00:38:47,195 --> 00:38:48,446
不要
{\fs14}Oh, no.{\r}

433
00:38:49,019 --> 00:38:51,131
夫人 你不能整天躺在床上
{\fs14}Come on, Madame. You can't stay in bed all day.{\r}

434
00:38:52,299 --> 00:38:54,372
玛琳夫人希望大家去教堂
{\fs14}Madame Marin wants us all to go to church{\r}

435
00:38:54,508 --> 00:38:56,092
听佩里科恩牧师讲道
{\fs14}to hear Pastor Pellicorne preach.{\r}

436
00:38:57,588 --> 00:38:58,652
桌上有寄给你的一些东西
{\fs14}And there's something for you.{\r}

437
00:38:59,724 --> 00:39:00,560
一定出于工匠之手
{\fs14}It must be from the artisan.{\r}

438
00:39:00,634 --> 00:39:01,856
反正是你订购的物件
{\fs14}Whatever it was you ordered.{\r}

439
00:39:03,312 --> 00:39:04,616
可我没再订任何东西了
{\fs14}But I didn't order anything.{\r}

440
00:39:06,176 --> 00:39:08,592
那就更应该看看里面有什么了
{\fs14}Well, then. All the more reason to find out what's inside.{\r}

441
00:40:35,265 --> 00:40:38,857
看呐 他们带野蛮人过来了
{\fs14}Look! They brought the savage.{\r}

442
00:40:51,969 --> 00:40:55,765
庄园主 密尔曼斯夫人
{\fs14}Seigneur, Madame Meermans.{\r}

443
00:40:56,617 --> 00:40:58,431
令弟在哪
{\fs14}Where is your brother?{\r}

444
00:40:58,992 --> 00:41:02,036
约翰尼斯有邀请你一同用餐吗
{\fs14}Did Johannes invite you to dine with us?{\r}

445
00:41:02,618 --> 00:41:04,546
他并没有
{\fs14}No, he did not.{\r}

446
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,393
所以你们是要不请自来了
{\fs14}But you will come, won't you?{\r}

447
00:41:08,055 --> 00:41:11,666
负责邀请的 不应该是他的妻子吗
{\fs14}Shouldn't his wife be the one who issues the invitation?{\r}

448
00:41:12,709 --> 00:41:16,073
请务必明天过来
{\fs14}Please, do come tomorrow.{\r}

449
00:41:17,644 --> 00:41:20,023
很荣幸受到邀请
{\fs14}We would be honoured.{\r}

450
00:41:20,516 --> 00:41:22,808
请入座吧
{\fs14}Come, let us take our place.{\r}

451
00:41:30,478 --> 00:41:36,315
通奸 高利贷 乱伦
{\fs14}Adultery! Usury! Fornication!{\r}

452
00:41:36,421 --> 00:41:41,215
以及更邪恶的 无法面对上帝的行为
{\fs14}And fouler deeds, too degraded to name in God's house!{\r}

453
00:41:41,334 --> 00:41:46,317
为何我要谈及所多玛和蛾摩拉的罪行(罪恶之地 源自《圣经》)
{\fs14}Do I talk of Sodom? Of Gomorrah!{\r}

454
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:50,267
不 我所说的罪行就在阿姆斯特丹
{\fs14}No, I speak of Amsterdam!{\r}

455
00:41:50,357 --> 00:41:54,902
这个封闭的城市 无人见识个中罪孽
{\fs14}A city of closed doors, through which no man can see.{\r}

456
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:58,563
内拉 过来  但是上帝洞悉一切
{\fs14}-Nella! Please! -But God sees!{\r}

457
00:41:58,673 --> 00:42:02,746
长久以来 我们一直忍受着同胞的罪恶
{\fs14}For too long we have tolerated the iniquities of our fellow men.{\r}

458
00:42:02,839 --> 00:42:06,100
但是风暴即将到来
{\fs14}But a storm is coming.{\r}

459
00:42:06,218 --> 00:42:14,327
所以让我们审视着自己的内心
{\fs14}So, look now into your own hearts{\r}

460
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:18,814
也审视着身边之人的内心
{\fs14}and the hearts of your neighbours,{\r}

461
00:42:18,973 --> 00:42:23,438
好好反省自己犯下的罪孽
{\fs14}and consider how you have sinned.{\r}

462
00:42:24,051 --> 00:42:27,011
玛琳 玛琳 你还好吧
{\fs14}Marin. Marin, are you quite well?{\r}

463
00:42:27,475 --> 00:42:32,399
为人丈夫 要深爱自己的妻子
{\fs14}Husbands, love your wives...{\r}

464
00:43:51,777 --> 00:43:53,748
只有两把
{\fs14}Only two of them...{\r}

465
00:44:05,233 --> 00:44:06,934
你在干什么
{\fs14}What are you doing?{\r}

466
00:44:11,526 --> 00:44:13,252
这些从哪里来的
{\fs14}Where did you get these?{\r}

467
00:44:13,311 --> 00:44:15,400
娃娃屋
{\fs14}The Miniaturist.{\r}

468
00:44:16,212 --> 00:44:17,438
我不知道工匠的名字
{\fs14}I don't know their name.{\r}

469
00:44:17,498 --> 00:44:19,544
玛琳给我的斯密特名单上 只有这一家工匠
{\fs14}Marin gave me Smit's List. It was the only one in there.{\r}

470
00:44:19,596 --> 00:44:20,880
你告诉他们什么了
{\fs14}What did you tell them?{\r}

471
00:44:21,696 --> 00:44:22,703
什么都没说
{\fs14}Nothing.{\r}

472
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:23,895
但是你订制了这些娃娃
{\fs14}But you ordered these.{\r}

473
00:44:23,955 --> 00:44:26,840
不 这不是我订制的
{\fs14}No. No, I didn't order these.{\r}

474
00:44:26,902 --> 00:44:29,843
我只订制了鲁特琴 笼子和杏仁糖
{\fs14}I only ordered the lute, the cage and the marzipan.{\r}

475
00:44:29,895 --> 00:44:31,922
这些娃娃 是自己送过来的
{\fs14}These just... came.{\r}

476
00:44:32,009 --> 00:44:33,829
他们怎么知道照着谁的样子做
{\fs14}How did they know what to make?{\r}

477
00:44:34,323 --> 00:44:36,232
我也不知道
{\fs14}I don't know.{\r}

478
00:44:36,312 --> 00:44:37,904
不许再订了
{\fs14}No more.{\r}

479
00:44:39,087 --> 00:44:41,386
不许再订了 听见了吗
{\fs14}No more, you understand?{\r}

480
00:44:41,836 --> 00:44:44,416
我想你忘记了自己的身份
{\fs14}I think you're forgetting your place.{\r}

481
00:44:46,313 --> 00:44:48,228
我什么身份
{\fs14}What is that?{\r}

482
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:50,208
仆人
{\fs14}As a servant.{\r}

483
00:44:50,286 --> 00:44:54,668
我的身份是保护这座房子和里面的人 包括你
{\fs14}My place is to protect this house, and all in it, including you.{\r}

484
00:45:00,884 --> 00:45:04,890
我们同生共死
{\fs14}We stand or fall together.{\r}

485
00:45:12,325 --> 00:45:17,026
佩里科恩牧师周日的训诫真是精彩 对吧
{\fs14}A wonderful sermon from Pastor Pellicorne on Sunday, don't you think?{\r}

486
00:45:18,554 --> 00:45:21,707
不过当然 约翰尼斯 你错过了
{\fs14}Oh, but of course, you missed it, Johannes.{\r}

487
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,303
让我猜猜他说了什么
