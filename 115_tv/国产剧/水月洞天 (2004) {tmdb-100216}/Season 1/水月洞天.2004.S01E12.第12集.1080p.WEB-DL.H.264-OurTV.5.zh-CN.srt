00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,858
You knew.

164
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,894
You've always known me.

165
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:37,462
It appears so.

166
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:44,803
Maybe your "always" and
my "always" are not the same.

167
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:46,971
Why didn't you tell me?

168
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:49,774
I'm sure I had my reasons.

169
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:52,410
I need blood samples.

170
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:55,113
You don't change, do you?

171
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:56,748
I'll need a microscope.

172
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,218
Uh, there's one upstairs
in the office.

173
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,721
I'll draw a fresh blood sample.

174
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:08,126
Come on.
You need to lie down.

175
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:10,895
Come here.

176
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:14,099
- How'd you convince her?
- The way you taught me.

177
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:16,935
With a gun and the truth.

178
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:19,738
Gun?
I thought you flew to new york.

179
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,006
I did.
The gun was a toy.

180
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:23,975
You shouldn't have
brought her here.

181
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:25,510
The risk to the timeline,
it's too--

182
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:29,481
I didn't tell her much.
Besides, you're dying.

183
00:12:29,483 --> 00:12:33,752
- She can help.
- I die, you die.

184
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,920
Nothing anyone can do
will change that.

185
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,856
I got jones here,
didn't I?

186
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:39,791
Jones is here
because she's always come here.

187
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:41,760
It's fate.

188
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:45,263
There's no such thing
as fate.

189
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:49,000
Cassie, it's over.

190
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:05,784
There's a long list
of what we don't have.

191
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:07,252
But that has never
stopped us before,

192
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:09,287
And it will not stop us now.

193
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:14,826
We can't--we lost practically
everything in the fire.

194
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:17,495
We can, and we will.

195
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:21,800
We're not giving up.
Start with our own archives.

196
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:24,035
Here.
Remount the storage drives.

197
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:27,572
This is madness.
Just blindly forward?

198
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:29,440
Well, forward is
the only direction available

199
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:31,476
At the moment.

200
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:35,446
I want everything you can find
on the 12 monkeys, markridge,

201
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:38,950
Goines, oliver peters,
dr. Railly.

202
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:43,021
Dig deep.
No detail is too small.

203
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:46,858
Markridge was making significant
political contributions.

204
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,993
This is from washington dulles.

205
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,262
Judging by the pattern
of viral dissemination,

206
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:53,164
It would suggest air travel.

207
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:58,136
The cdc's original report
was signed by dr. Railly.

208
00:13:58,138 --> 00:14:01,840
There was a break-in at
this laboratory, late November.

209
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:04,976
(scientist)
and these murders at markridge
were never solved.

210
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:09,280
(jones)
markridge got a new ceo
in late 2015.

211
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:18,423
Facing facts, coming to terms--
we don't need graphs

212
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:20,592
And pie charts to illustrate
what a shit show

213
00:14:20,594 --> 00:14:26,064
The death of leland goines,
the operation troy debacle,

214
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:29,634
The vanishing of dr. Peters--
these things subjected us

215
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:34,138
To substantial economic gravity.

216
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:37,909
And we are, quite frankly,
hemorrhaging trust.

217
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,946
[woman moaning]

218
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:45,583
What the hell is this?

219
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:48,553
A takeover.
Hostile.

220
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:51,289
An embarrassing takeover.
Move.

221
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:54,058
Jennifer,
what are you doing?

222
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,260
He's right about trust.

223
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:57,662
If I can be frank for a moment:

224
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:59,464
Never trust a man
with an offshore account

225
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:02,600
And a mid-sized chubby
for redheads.

226
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:05,036
- This is ridiculous.
- [laughs]

227
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:07,505
Embezzlement, infidelity?

228
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:09,974
Friendo, you're first mate
on the <i>titanic,</i>

229
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:12,176
And you're filling up lifeboats
with caviar.

230
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:15,580
Here.
It's your resignation.

231
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:19,183
As majority shareholder pursuant
to dear daddy,

232
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:22,186
I am exercising my right,
as outlined in article blah,

233
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:26,958
Sub-section yada, to hostile-y
take you bitches over!

234
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,595
- Security.
- Hmm, security.

235
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,097
- Security.
- Security!

236
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,466
Works for me now.

237
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:37,702
Crazy ironic.
Ahh!

238
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:41,072
Raise your hand if you would
like to be the new him.

239
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:43,341
Done.
Meet the new boss.

240
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:46,511
Same as...

241
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:49,247
Absolutely nothing at all.

242
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:52,183
(markridge ceo)
you're insane.
You should be locked up.

243
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:54,719
Uh, charges were dropped.
New evidence.

244
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:57,355
I've been set free.
I've been...

245
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:58,589
- Released.
- No.

246
00:15:58,591 --> 00:15:59,657
- Let loose.
- No.

247
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:01,559
- Un-caged.
- Yes, that!

248
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:05,463
Un-caged.
[roars]

249
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:08,599
And I'm never, ever going back.

250
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:12,403
Okay, markridge,
listen up.

251
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:14,405
I've got some ideas.

252
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:22,480
Comparing this sample to
what you showed me in new york,

253
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,149
It's as you feared,
he's getting worse.

254
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,318
Mr. Cole is going to die.

255
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:39,464
He's not just a friend.
He's more to you.

256
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:41,532
Much more.

257
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:43,234
How did you meet him?

258
00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:45,203
I told you.

259
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:49,073
They found a recording
that I make and...

260
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:52,777
The future you sent him here
to find me.

261
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:55,346
And you believed his story?

262
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:59,650
No, but he brought my watch
with him from the future,

263
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:02,353
And he broke time.

264
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:12,697
- The same watch from his time?
- Yes.

265
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:15,066
- That's profoundly risky.
- I know.

266
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:18,169
It caused a paradox.
It almost killed us.

267
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:20,338
[laughs]
yeah.

268
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:24,108
Mother nature doesn't like it
if you rearrange her furniture.

269
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:27,145
Right.

270
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:29,614
That must have been
extraordinary to see--

271
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:33,051
Matter coming in contact
with itself.

272
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:35,453
Wait, just a moment.

273
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:38,089
Um, when was mr. Cole born?

274
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:43,761
Uh, 2009, I think.
Why?

275
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:46,564
Splintering has corrupted
his genetic composition

276
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:50,635
At a molecular level, but if
his current dna were introduced

277
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:52,770
To his original
molecular structure,

278
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:55,306
It might undo
the quantum shifting.

279
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:59,110
A paradox.
To save his life?

280
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:04,082
We could get a blood sample
from the original cole.

281
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:06,617
It might work.

282

and the rest of mankind,

how to save you.

Mr. Marker, you're a lion
protecting your pride.

Ensuring your seed continues.

309
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:55,493
Why would you feel shame
over what you were built to do?

00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:57,395
To endure.

311

To thrive.

312
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:04,235
Because it's wrong.

313
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:09,774
No, this is not
a moral compromise.

314
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:14,212
It's primal.
Elemental.

315

on genocide.

will be safe.

I'm sorry I can't--

00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:46,603
Hey.
Don't use that word.

487
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:49,539
The only failure...

488
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:51,541
Is giving up.

489
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:53,610
Exactly.

490
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:32,082
Are you all right?

491
00:32:32,084 --> 00:32:35,419
- Yeah, just trying to--
- I know, I know.

00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:38,722
I'm so sorry.

00:32:38,724 --> 00:32:42,426
I just thought
I'd be there for him.

Always.

Yeah.

Cass, please don't ask
a lot of questions.

- No, what are you doing?

- Aaron, what--
- it's why nothing changes.

Oh, my god.
What did you do?

They wouldn't wait any longer,

- Please.

The boy?

I left him with katarina.
I didn't want him to see.

You're throwing away

I've decided
to keep the child.

(railly)
but the plague--
you might not have much time.

538
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:02,879
I'm a scientist, dr. Railly.
I don't believe in fate.

539
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:10,920
I could tell you, you know.

It's tempting, but no.

It's just as likely to undo
your work as it is to help mine.

545
00:38:24,403 --> 00:38:28,071
The causality of temporal
physics is unpredictable.

00:38:28,073 --> 00:38:30,640
And if it is fate that our paths
will cross again,

547
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,942
Then we'll find
the answers together.

But listen, mr. Cole,
you have to understand,

The paradox has destroyed
your ability

This plant
grew in an environment
