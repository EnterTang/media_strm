4
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:31,362
It's a beautiful day, isn't it?

5
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,624
So far, but they're calling for storms later.

6
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,701
Well, you know the heartland, some things can change in a minute.

7
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,839
-Is everyone assembled? -Twenty-four hours isn't a lot of notice.

8
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:42,804
Will you give me a heads-up as to the nature of your remarks?

9
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:46,434
Just one of my customary motivational speeches you've heard hundreds of times.

10
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:48,706
-How are you? Good to see you. -How you doing?

11
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,817
-Good morning. Good to see you. -Good morning.

12
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:54,078
-Good morning. Good to see you. -Thank you.

13
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:55,653
Fire up the troops!

14
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:59,019
The plant made a profit this quarter for the first time in two years.

15
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:02,252
My people are expecting a pat on the back, and they deserve to get it.

16
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:05,023
I'll try not to disappoint them.

17
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,660
Thank you.

18
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:13,328
Thank you.

19
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:16,532
As most of you know...

20
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:20,509
...you've all worked extremely hard this past year...

21
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,979
...and you should all be proud of yourselves.

22
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,583
Just as a ship can only follow the course...

23
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,922
...set by its captain...

24
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:41,397
...any business is only as good as its leadership.

25
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:46,060
Due to management failures beyond your control...

26
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,766
...this plant will be closing...

27
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:51,869
...effective immediately.

28
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,046
Good luck to all of you.

29
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,719
You just fired 2500 people and blamed it on me.

30
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:04,550
One day you'll thank me. Smallville isn't in your future.

31
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:07,522
-It's just a brief chapter in your biography. -Don't do this.

32
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:11,130
We live in a meritocracy, Lex. The weak get left behind.

33
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,322
The plant wasn't producing. I had no other options.

34
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,491
Spare me the corporate barbarian spiel.

35
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:18,364
Those people have husbands and wives, children, mortgages.

36
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:20,768
We're in business to make profits, not friends!

37
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,636
Don't let your emotions get in the way of making tough decisions!

38
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,404
Don't lecture me about letting emotions get in the way.

39
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,069
This plant was showing a profit.

40
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:31,615
You're shutting it down because I wouldn't go work for you in Metropolis.

41
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:36,244
Lex, you may have felt that you found a home here, but you were mistaken.

42
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:40,017
This was just your training ground. Well, your training is over!

43
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,931
You're coming home, son!

第二十一集:暴风
Pete, I need your opinion. Classic black or traditional red?

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
特别客串主演:约翰・格鲁夫
For what?

66
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,702
My tie-cummerbund combo. I gotta get my tux order in today.

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
客串主演:罗伯特・韦斯顿
If I were you, I'd stick with the traditional black.

68
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,777
-This is no time to get adventurous. -You're right.

69
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:11,007
I don't know, Clark. Red always looks good on you.

70
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:12,173
Then red it is.

71
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,082
Thanks. Now I gotta go make a call and change my order.

72
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,519
I don't want people mistaking us for twins.

73
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
联合执行制片:格列哥・比曼
Yeah, because that happens all the time.

74
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,892
You seem really excited about the dance.

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
监督制片:马克・伏黑顿
I am, but between the tickets, the tux and buying the flowers, it gets expensive.

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
制片:迈克尔・格林
You should try finding the right dress.

77
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,433
Guess the limo's out.

78
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,300
制片:道里斯・伊根
I'm actually thinking of asking Lex if I can borrow his.

79
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,200
联合制片:格雷格・沃克
Chloe says she doesn't care, but deep down I know she wants one.

80
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,533
I'm trying to surprise her, so keep it between us.

81
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,702
My lips are sealed.

82
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,381
Chloe?

83
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:46,074
They're closing the LuthorCorp plant.

84
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,200
制片人:鲍勃・哈格罗夫

85
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:58,720
-So you heard. -<i>The Ledger</i> rushed a special edition.

86
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:01,890
They haven't done that since the meteor shower.

87
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,127
I talked to Chloe. She's pretty upset.

88
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,135
I spoke to her father. He's in shock.

89
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,570
I don't blame him.

90
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,200
联合执行制片:肯・霍顿
-How's this gonna affect us? -That plant was Smallville's biggest employer.

91
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,200
剧本:阿尔弗雷德・哥夫，麦尔斯・米莱
Shutting it down is gonna have a domino effect.

92
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:18,078
I can't believe Lex would run it into the ground in less than a year.

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
故事:菲利普・莱温斯
Why are you blaming Lex? His dad closed the plant.

94
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,084
Whatever issues Lionel Luthor has with his son have now cost half the town their jobs.

95
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:28,921
You should be happy, then. It means Lex is going back to Metropolis and out of our lives.

96
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:31,655
The plant closing is gonna hurt a lot of people, Clark.

97
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:36,495
As much as I would like Lex out of our lives, I wouldn't wish that on anybody.

98
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,200
导演:格列哥・比曼

99
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,200
（卢瑟公司农工厂关闭，管理不善）

100
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:31,362
天气真好呀

101
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,624
现在是，但稍后会有暴风雨

102
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,701
内陆嘛，瞬息万变

103
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,839
- 大家都到齐了吗? - 二十四小时集合还是有点急了

104
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:42,804
能给点有关你演讲的提示吗？

105
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:46,434
就是惯例性质的激励演讲，你都听过几百遍了

106
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:48,706
- 你好吗，很高兴见到你 - 你好吗？

107
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,817
- 早上好，很高兴见到你 - 早上好

108
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:54,078
- 早上好，很高兴见到你 - 谢谢

109
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:55,653
我们团队加油！

110
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:59,019
本季度是这个工厂在两年来首次盈利

111
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:02,252
我的人都期待有所奖励，这也是他们应得的

112
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:05,023
我尽量不让他们失望

113
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,660
谢谢

114
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:13,328
谢谢

115
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:16,532
你们大都知道…

116
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:20,509
…这一年来大家工作极其努力…

117
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,979
…你们都应该感到自豪

118
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,583
就像一艘船只能跟着…

119
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,922
…船长设定的路线…

120
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:41,397
…所有事业都关乎其领导

121
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:46,060
由于管理失败已经不是各位能控制的了…

122
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,766
…这间工厂将会关闭…

123
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:51,869
…即时生效

124
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,046
祝君好运

125
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,719
你刚刚让2500人失业了，而且还归罪于我

126
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:04,550
总有一天你会感激我的，你的未来不在这里

127
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:07,522
- 这只是你人生的开篇 - 别这样

128
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:11,130
我们生活在精英统治的世界，莱克斯，优胜劣汰

129
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,322
工厂没有生产力，我别无选择

130
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,491
少跟我来那套

131
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:18,364
那些人上有老下有小

132
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:20,768
做生意只看利益，不讲人情

133
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,636
不要优柔寡断！

134
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,404
别教训我感情用事

135
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,069
这间工厂是有利润的

136
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:31,615
你关闭工厂只是因为我不跟你去大都会工作

137
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:36,244
莱克斯，你可能把这里当成家，但你错了

138
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:40,017
你只是在这里锻炼锻炼的，而现在大限已到！

139
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,931
你得回家了，儿子！

140
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,568
皮特，给点意见，经典黑还是传统红？

141
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,830
配什么?

142
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,702
我的小礼服，今天就送到了

143
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,275
我是你的话，我会坚持传统黑

144
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,777
- 这时候还是保险点 - 你说得对

145
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:11,007
克拉克，这可不一定哦 你穿红色一向很好看

146
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:12,173
那就红的吧

147
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,082
谢了，现在我得打个电话改一下我那件

148
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,519
我可不想人们误以为我们是双胞胎

149
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,420
就是，咱俩那么容易被误认哈

150
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,892
看样子你很待见那舞会

151
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:27,021
的确，但除了票价，礼服和买花都要花不少钱

152
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,929
你最好找条合适的礼服

153
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,433
看来豪华轿车是没了

154
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,265
我在想是否要向莱克斯借

155
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,374
克洛伊说无所谓，但她内心还是会想要的

156
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,533
我想给她个惊喜，所以就你知我知

157
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,702
我嘴很严的

158
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,381
克洛伊？

159
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:46,074
他们要关闭卢瑟农工厂了

160
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:58,720
- 你们也听说了 - 分类报紧急出了特刊

161
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:01,890
自从流星雨事件后就没再出过特刊

162
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,127
我跟克罗伊谈过了，她特沮丧

163
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,135
我和她父亲说了，他很震惊

164
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,570
我不怪他

165
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:12,537
- 这对我们会有什么影响? - 那间工厂是镇上最大的雇主

166
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,703
工厂倒闭将会产生多米诺效应

167
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:18,078
我没想到，不到一年，莱克斯就把它毁了

168
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,742
你干嘛要怪莱克斯？他老爸关的厂

169
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,084
老卢瑟和他儿子的矛盾害镇上一半人丢了工作

170
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:28,921
那你该高兴才是，这样莱克斯就会回大都会 离开我们的视线

171
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:31,655
克拉克，工厂倒闭会伤害很多人的

172
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:36,495
虽然我很想让莱克斯滚蛋，但我也不想害到人

173
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:42,435
我知道的，爸爸，只不过莱克斯在乎这个镇
I know, Dad. It's just.... Lex cares about the town.

174
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,269
他有大抱负
He said he had big plans.

175
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:47,607
下地狱的路也是由好心铺成的
The road to hell is paved with good intentions.

176
00:05:56,122 --> 00:06:00,183
好了，转弯，就快到了
Okay. Turn. We're almost there.

177
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,952
好了
All right.

178
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:04,289
- 好 - 停
-Okay. -Stop.

179
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,192
张开眼睛
Open your eyes.

180
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:10,568
哇！
Wow!

181
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,831
你干嘛要神秘兮兮的？
Why are you being so mysterious?

182
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:16,702
- 我就不能给女朋友准备个意外野餐? - 我又没抱怨
-Can't a guy plan a picnic for his girlfriend? -I'm not complaining.

183
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,969
只是有点意外
It's just kind of spontaneous.

184
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,113
你是在说我平时很无聊吗？
Are you saying I'm usually boring?

185
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,876
我是说你太好了，好奇今儿什么日子
I'm saying this is very nice. I'm just wondering what the occasion is.

186
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,646
就是要感谢你做过的一切
It's to thank you for everything.

187
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,722
今年很坎坷，多谢你一路支持
It's been a difficult year, and you've stood by me.

188
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:35,793
我曾将你推开，而你 本可以另觅他人，但你没有
I pushed you away, and you could have made other choices. You didn't.

189
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:41,559
我们一起很长时间了 我不会在你需要我的时候离开
We've been together a long time. I'd never abandon you when you needed me.

190
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,064
我有件事要告诉你
There's something I want to tell you.

191
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:53,506
惠特尼，你知道，也许我们可以…
Whitney, you know, maybe we should--

192
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:58,040
- 这是什么？ - 读读
-What's this? -Read it.

193
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,554
美国海军陆战队？
United States Marine Corps?

194
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,689
我参军了
I enlisted.

195
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:14,063
我想这是我该做的
I think it's the right thing for me to do.

196
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:17,930
当我发现父亲的勋章时，我感觉他在指引我
When I found my dad's medals, I felt he was telling me which path I should take.

197
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:22,731
- 你不能为了你父亲就入伍 - 我没有，这是为了我们
-You can't do this for your father. -I'm not. I'm doing it for us.

198
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,568
求你别生气
Please, don't be mad.

199
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:31,279
事情发生太快了，你知道吗？
It's just so fast, you know?

200
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,545
我需要点时间来消化
I need some time to process it.

201
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:38,556
我没多少时间了
I don't have a lot of time.

202
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:43,791
周六晚我就得出海做基础训练了
I ship out for basic training Saturday night.

203
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:48,629
那毕业典礼呢？
What about graduation?

204
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:51,768
镇上唯一让我牵挂的就只有你了
The only thing I'm gonna miss in Smallville is you.

205
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,665
你会等我吗？
Will you wait for me?

206
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:15,755
克拉克，我收到你的消息了 但我今天很糟糕
Clark, I got your messages, but I've been having a bad day.

207
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:17,996
镇纸不错
Nice paperweight.

208
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:21,164
对，很特别
Yeah, very unique.

209
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,666
你不怕被人看到和我这败家子在一起吗?
Sure you can afford being seen with the town pariah?

210
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,430
我愿意冒这个险
I'll take my chances.

211
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,133
莱克斯，发生什么事了？
What happened, Lex?

212
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:32,106
现在有两个说法…
The two theories seem to be...

213
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,940
…一是我很无能，把工厂毁了…
...I either ran the plant into the ground through incompetence...

214
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,344
…二是我为了回大都会，故意为之
...or did it deliberately to go back to Metropolis.

215
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,680
你爸早就让你去那边工作了，你说出事实就好
Your dad already offered you a job in Metropolis. Just tell people the truth.

216
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,117
那我就是无能了
Then I get stuck with the incompetence rap.

217
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,950
还不如被世人责骂
Being reviled is the lesser evil.

218
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,184
那你就是要回去大都会了
I guess you're going back to Metropolis, then.

219
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:52,457
我爸爸设这个局就是为了这个 但是这还不算完
That's why my father orchestrated his coup, but this isn't over.

220
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:55,465
- 你还有什么计划？ - 差不多吧
-You have a plan? -Maybe.

221
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:02,697
你先忙，不打扰你了
You have a lot of work to do.

222
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:07,006
克拉克，谢谢你能过来看我 这对我很重要
Clark, thanks for stopping by. It means a lot.

223
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,703
交朋友是为了什么啊？
What are friends for?

224
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:25,063
就知道可以在这儿找到你
Thought I'd find you here.

225
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,997
我爸爸和我无法共同面对这种灾难，所以…
My dad and I can't really do the whole depressed thing together, so....

226
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:31,830
如果你不想参加周六晚会，我能理解的
If you're not up for Saturday night, I'd understand.

227
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:35,906
开什么玩笑？那是我现在唯一期待的事情了
You kidding me? It's the only thing I have to look forward to right now.

228
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:40,739
还有就是，趁我还没走， 我很想再享受下斯摩维尔古怪有趣的风俗
Besides, I want to enjoy all the quaint Smallville High customs while I still can.

229
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,608
什么？你要去哪儿？
Why? Where are you going?

230
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:46,115
我爸爸正考虑搬回大都会定居
My dad's talking about moving us back to Metropolis permanently.

231
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,587
那《火炬报》，还有你的朋友呢？
What about the <i>Torch</i> and all your friends?

232
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,253
我现在还没时间考虑这些
I can't even think about it right now.

233
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:55,254
克拉克，我也不想再那么辛苦
Clark, I'm not exactly psyched about having to fight my way...

234
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,795
到新的高中再经营一次
...through the high school hierarchy all over again.

235
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,693
你会想我的，对吧？
You're gonna miss me, right?

236
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,236
这还用问？
Do you even have to ask?

237
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:08,373
答应我，周六晚上会很精彩
Just promise me Saturday night's gonna be great.

238
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,941
那将会是一个你永生难忘的夜晚
It'll be a night you won't forget.

239
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,050
很高兴你们能来
I appreciate you coming.

240
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,055
我父亲还不知道这次会议 而且我也不希望他知道
My father doesn't know about this meeting, and I'd like to keep it that way.

241
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:25,850
当我初来乍到时…
When I first came here...

242
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:29,153
…人们可能会觉得 我可能又是一个典型的纨绔子弟
...people assumed I was just another glaring example of nepotism...

243
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:32,558
…没有本事，通过裙带关系不断晋升的人
...unskilled and promoted over the heads of the more competent and deserving.

244
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,394
但我想让这屋里的人对我刮目相看
But I'd like to think the people in this room feel differently.

245
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,968
如果我们能够筹集到资金， 让所有员工买断股份的话…
If we can raise the capital for an employee-led buyout...

246
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,735
- 我们可以让农工厂继续经营下去的 - 买断？
-...we can keep the plant running. -Buyout?

247
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:43,807
我可以筹集将近90%的资金
I can raise nearly 90%% of the capital.

248
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:46,937
剩下的怎么办？ 我们得抵押房产吗
What about the rest? We're supposed to mortgage our houses?

249
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:48,808
的确有风险，我明白
It's a risk, I know.

250
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,506
但好处是，我们能让那些投资人成为少数派了
But in exchange, the investors will become minority owners.

251
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:55,313
你父亲不是控制着董事会么？ 他会同意买断么？
Doesn't your father control the board? Why would he go along with a buyout?

252
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:59,754
我认识一些董事会的成员，我可以说服他们 并且不需要他们全部都通过
I know a couple of members I can convince, and I don't need a unanimous decision.

253
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:03,588
现在摆在你们面前的是一个能够决定 你们自己命运的机会
I'm offering you the chance to take control of your own destiny.

254
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:06,596
支持我，我们会赢的
Stand with me, and we'll win.

255
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,709
克拉克
Clark.

256
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
（斯摩维尔镇最好的卡布奇诺）

257
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:29,785
这么好性质出来逛街？
Out wandering the streets of Smallville?

258
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,615
怎么了？
What is it?

259
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:38,290
我刚听说克罗伊要搬走了
I just found out that Chloe might be leaving for good.

260
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:41,797
真不敢相信这是真的
Not sure I really believe it's true.

261
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,693
我理解你的感受
I know what you mean.

262
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:47,371
什么，你理解？
You do?

263
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:51,638
惠特尼也要入伍参加海军去了
Whitney's going off to join the Marines.

264
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:55,678
这太扯了
That's intense.

265
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:58,874
他告诉我这么做是为了我们俩
He told me he was doing it for us.

266
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,875
问我是否愿意等他
Asked if I'd wait for him.

267
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,015
真的吗？那你怎么说？
Really? What did you say?

268
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,858
什么也没说
Nothing.

269
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,989
我只是傻傻站在那儿，很吃惊，什么也没说
I kind of just stood there in stunned silence.

270
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,328
前阵子他还说他担心他的英文论文
One day he's worried about his English paper...

271
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:21,666
紧接着他却要穿上制服，拯救世界去了
...and the next, he's putting on a uniform and saving the world.

272
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,999
那你没给他什么承诺么？
So you didn't commit?

273
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,042
我告诉他我不确定
I told him I wasn't sure.

274
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:32,679
他什么时候出发？
When does he head out?

275
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,584
周六晚上
Saturday night.

276
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:43,526
这下你倒是不用发愁礼服的事了
Guess you don't have to worry about your dress.

277
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:50,535
真不敢相信，惠特尼和克罗伊都要离开我们
I can't believe both Whitney and Chloe are gonna be out of our lives.

278
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,704
我也是
Me neither.

279
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:57,273
我想我们被甩了，克拉克
Guess we get left behind, Clark.

280
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,527
你觉得是什么引发爆炸的？
What do you think caused the explosion?

281
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,686
儿子，我想可能是油管漏油吧
Son, my guess is it was a leaky fuel line.

282
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:28,664
火苗引燃了车上的肥料，我应该再仔细检查下
The fumes must have ignited the fertilizer in the truck. I should have checked it better.

283
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,769
- 庆幸的是，车上是我，不是你们二老 - 哦，真是我的好儿子
-I'm glad it was me and not one of you guys. -Oh, sweetheart.

284
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:34,269
奇怪的是，这次我没有一点灼烧感
The truth is, I barely felt the heat this time.

285
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,268
并且爆炸碎片也没有造成任何瘀伤
And the debris didn't leave any bruises.

286
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:43,312
随着年龄的增长 你的身体肯定变得越来越强壮
As you get older, your body must be getting stronger.

287
00:14:49,878 --> 00:14:51,000
（你可以选择…）

288
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,967
你还不赶紧收拾东西？
You're not in a hurry to pack?

289
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:06,161
我就没打算走
That's because I'm not leaving.

290
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:10,968
接受命运吧，莱克斯
Accept your fate, Lex. It's time to move on.

291
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:15,876
我设法使主管委员会投票 让他们接受员工对农场的股权买断
I'm forcing a vote of the board of directors to accept an employee buyout of the plant.

292
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:20,318
你要干嘛？说服员工们进行二次抵押？
What are you gonna do? Convince the employees to take out a second mortgage?

293
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:24,083
- 利用他们的退休金 - 差不多就那个意思吧
-Cash in their IRAs. -Something like that.

294
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,885
即使你卖掉所有股票，耗尽你的信托基金
Even if you sell all your stock and drain your trust fund...

295
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,124
还是不够，莱克斯
...you still come up short, Lex.

296
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:32,521
不够的钱你打算怎么办呢？
What will you do about the rest of the money?

297
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:35,394
现在接受股权买断，你还能保持你的尊严
Take the buyout now, and you can keep your dignity.

298
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:39,594
- 这可比你留给我的多多了 - 可真是我的好儿子啊
-That's more than you left me. -That's very gracious of you, son.

299
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:44,038
你先不妨看看这个
You might wanna look at this first.

300
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:53,411
你已经买下了斯摩维尔储贷银行
You've bought the Smallville Savings and Loan.

301
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:57,681
继续，继续你的购买计划 但是记住了，我掌握着你员工的抵押房屋
Go ahead, lead your buyout. But remember, I own your employees' mortgages.

302
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:00,120
一旦他们欠了一点还款
As soon as they begin missing payments...

303
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,420
我会毫不犹豫地取消他们的赎回权
...I won't hesitate to foreclose on each and every one of them.

304
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:07,463
到时候他们就会无家可归 然后这一切都会归咎到你头上
They'll be homeless, and it will be your fault.

305
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,566
你有准备承担那样的责任么？
You ready to accept that kind of responsibility?

306
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:13,728
如果你胆敢跟我作对的话，儿子
If you're going to take me on, son...

307
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:18,468
你得拿出真本事才行
...you're gonna have to bring your game up to a whole different level.

308
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,910
- 克罗伊，你去哪儿了？ - 我正打算去取我的礼服呢
-Where have you been? -I went to pick up my dress.

309
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,605
- 我们有麻烦了 - 你不能参加了？
-We have a problem. -You can't go.

310
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:27,274
没有，只是不能接你了，我的车子被烧了
I just can't pick you up. My transportation kind of went up in flames.

311
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:30,581
我本打算问莱克斯，能不能借他的轿车来用 但是农工厂的事儿…
I was gonna ask Lex if I could borrow his limo, but with the plant--

312
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:34,317
- 克拉克，那就我来开好了 - 抱歉破坏了王子的美好形象
-Clark, I'll drive. -Ruins the whole Prince Charming vibe.

313
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,256
我也不是什么灰姑娘啊
Cinderella was never my role model.

314
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:40,421
- 为什么要当海军啊？ - 不知道，只是觉得自己该去
-Why the Marines? -I don't know. It's just something I gotta do.

315
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:44,429
- 惠特尼要去为山姆大叔打仗了 - 我听说了
-So Whitney's off to fight evil for Uncle Sam. -I heard.

316
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:47,538
那样的话拉娜岂不是又名花无主了
That technically makes Lana a free agent.

317
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,936
他请求她等他
He asked her to wait for him.

318
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,240
异地恋很难坚持下去的
Long-distance relationships never work.

319
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:56,871
人会变的，经历也不一样了 有点和我们类似，对吧？
People change, have different experiences. It's kind of like us, you know?

320
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:59,449
过不多久，你就会把我忘得一干二净的
After a couple of weeks, you'll forget all about me.

321
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,044
克罗伊，说什么呢！
Chloe!

322
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,850
好吧，我只是做了个噩梦
Okay, I just have this horrible nightmare...

323
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,619
梦见惠特尼前脚刚走，你就迫不及待跑到车站
...that you'll rush to the bus station after Whitney leaves...

324
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:12,286
然后向拉娜表白你永恒的爱意 剩下我一个人孤零零在体育馆等着
...and profess your undying love for Lana, and I'll be waiting at the gym alone.

325
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:15,194
如果你胆敢那样对我，克拉克 我永远都不会再搭理你
If you do that to me, Clark, I'll never speak to you again.

326
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,267
好了，我说完了
Okay, I said it.

327
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:20,031
克罗伊
Chloe.

328
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:32,307
我要和你一起跳舞，不是为别的 是我自己想要这样
I'm going to the dance with you not by default, but because I want to.

329
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,785
很好，我现在感觉好多了
All right, I feel better now.

330
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
（恭喜毕业，然后怎样？）

331
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:44,824
我能耽误你一分钟时间么，克拉克
If I could just have one minute of your time, Clark.

332
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,897
- 你怎么会知道我的名字？ - 我是罗杰・尼克松
-How do you know my name? -Roger Nixon.

333
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:51,628
我是询察报的记者，我很想写篇有关你的报道
I'm a journalist with the <i>Inquisitor</i>, and I would like to write a story about you.

334
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,335
谢谢，但是我不感兴趣
Thanks, but I'm really not interested.

335
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,066
你为何能在爆炸中不受伤？
Why weren't you hurt in that explosion?

336
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,405
你当时的确是在农场里的卡车上
You were in the truck on the farm.

337
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,013
我根本不在卡车附近
I was nowhere near that truck.

338
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,846
我是不是错过什么有意思的事了？
Am I missing something interesting?

339
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:07,610
莱克斯？
Lex?

340
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:13,148
你知道我名字，但我不知道你的
You know my name, but I don't know yours.

341
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,656
我叫罗杰・尼克松，我为询察报工作
Roger Nixon. I work for the <i>Inquisitor.</i>

342
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:20,060
你怎么和那种报纸同流合污啊？
When is someone gonna put that bad excuse for a tabloid out of its misery?

343
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:24,229
见到你很高兴，莱克斯
It was nice meeting you, Lex.

344
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,864
我们很快会再见面的，克拉克
I'm sure we'll talk again soon, Clark.

345
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:35,536
怎么回事
What was that all about?

346
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:38,649
他想在我身上挖掘些材料 使我成为某种英雄
He wants to do a story on me, make me out to be some kind of hero.

347
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:40,546
那报纸的人不是什么好东西，克拉克
The <i>Inquisitor</i>'s a rag, Clark.

348
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:43,449
如果我是你，我不会和他混在一起
If I were you, I wouldn't get mixed up with him.

349
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,920
我也不想
I don't intend to.

350
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:51,385
如果他再找你麻烦，告诉我
If he gives you any more trouble, let me know.

351
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,303
嗨，儿子
Hi, son.

352
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:12,076
出什么事了？
Something wrong?

353
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,844
询察者的记者想写我的事
A journalist from the <i>Inquisitor</i> wants to do a story on me.

354
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:18,249
他知道我当时在卡车里
He knows I was in the truck.

355
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:21,586
我不认为那是意外，他在专门测试我
I don't think it was an accident. I think he set it up to test me.

356
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,455
他怎么知道你能死里逃生？
How did he know you would survive?

357
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:26,655
他以前一定见过我做别的事
He must have seen me do something before.

358
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,995
我发誓自从费兰的事以后 我已经很小心了
Look, I swear, ever since Phelan, I've been so careful.

359
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,263
克拉克，这不是你的错
Clark, it's not your fault.

360
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,939
- 但是我该怎么办？ - 一切照旧，去上学，参加舞会
-But what do I do? -Carry on, go to school, go to the dance...

361
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:43,878
如果这记者真有什么证据 他会来找我们的
...and if this reporter's really got something, I'm sure he'll come talk to us.

362
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,791
还有什么事？
What else?

363
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:58,290
我想莱克斯可能有我太空船的部分残骸
I think Lex has a piece of the spaceship.

364
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:01,459
你确定？
Are you sure?

365
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,627
我在他桌上见过，就是遗失的那块
I saw it on his desk. It's the missing piece.

366
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:06,464
<i>他一定是在郊外捡到的</i>
<i>He must have found it in the field.</i>

367
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:09,266
<i>我不知道他是否起疑</i> <i>但谁能知道他会做什么呢？</i>
<i>I don't know if he suspects anything,</i> <i>but who knows what he'll do?</i>

368
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:12,877
- 我们都知道莱克斯是个追究到底的人… - 他不会想到是我们
-We all know how persistent Lex can be-- -He can't trace it to us.

369
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,980
你妈妈说得对，我们低调点就是了
Your mother's right, son. We'll just keep our heads low.

370
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,446
当你做日常事的时候，不要用你的超能
So when you do your chores, don't use your abilities.

371
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:20,744
<i>不论做什么事</i> <i>远离地下的避难室</i>
<i>Whatever you do,</i> <i>stay away from that storm cellar.</i>

372
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,402
你想见我, 莱克斯？
You wanted to see me, Lex?

373
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,940
我很意外，你竟然记得我的名字
I'm surprised you even remembered my name.

374
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,335
我警告过你，离他家远点
I warned you to stay away from the Kents.

375
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:49,742
让我猜猜，到这就是想提醒我
Let me guess. This is where you remind me...

376
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,577
你能对我做的所有可怕的事
...of all the terrible things you can have done to me.

377
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:56,243
我知道你已经完全清楚我的意图 我现在比较忙
As I'm sure you're well aware, I'm a little preoccupied at the moment.

378
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,685
没时间处理你的不满
I don't have time to deal with your annoyances.

379
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:02,850
我的发现远远超过了你和你的问题
Well, what I have discovered is beyond you and your problems...

380
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,360
以及你的威胁
...and your threats.

381
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:08,328
这些自负对你不利, 罗杰
This newfound self-assurance doesn't suit you, Roger.

382
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,163
友好点, 莱克斯 要不然我就不会把我的发现卖给你了
Be nice, Lex, or I may not let you bid on my discovery.

383
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:13,929
我知道你想买
And I know you'll want to...

384
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:18,941
尤其它还是关于车祸现场和肯特一家
...especially when you consider all your interest in the crash site and the Kents.

385
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:22,410
在那发现的东西与你和肯特家都无关
What was found out there has nothing to do with the Kents or with you.

386
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:23,809
你确定？
Are you certain?

387
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:27,085
罗杰,你有种就提供证据
Roger, for all your bravado, you have yet to show me anything.

388
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:30,881
今晚我就可以提供
I'll show you all the evidence you need tonight.

389
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:32,614
你会亲眼看到
And you'll see for yourself.

390
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:37,228
这些关于你朋友克拉克・肯特的事 远远超过你所知道的
There's a whole lot more to your friend Clark Kent than meets the eye.

391
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:44,396
- 我发誓, 如果你再骚扰克拉克和他的父母… - 谁说要骚扰？
-I swear, if you harass Clark or his parents-- -Who said anything about harassment?

392
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:48,335
或许我要告诉他们真相，是你先要研究他们 我才会惹上他们的
Maybe I'll just tell them the truth, that you turned me on to them.

393
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:54,169
如果你对我掌握的这些不感兴趣 我认识另一个姓卢瑟的，他可能会感兴趣
And if you're not interested in what I have, I know of another Luthor who will be.

394
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:58,412
你在玩火
You are playing a very dangerous game.

395
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:01,143
你最好祈祷你没错
You'd better pray you're not wrong.

396
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:11,255
妈妈，可以帮我一下吗？
Mom, can you give me a hand with this?

397
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:14,661
谁在那？
Who's there?

398
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,767
是我, 克拉克，你好吗？
It's me, Clark. Are you all right?

399
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:19,768
- 耶，很好 - 真的，你看上去有些紧张
-Yeah, I'm fine. -Really? You seem a little tense.

400
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:21,997
是跳舞那些事
It's just the dance and everything.

401
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,766
过来
Come here.

402
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:27,503
相信我打领带比你妈妈打得还多
I'm sure I've tied more of these than your mother.

403
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,280
我以为你会宅在家里
Thought you were holed up in the mansion.

404
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:33,782
我需要清醒下头脑，开车就到这了
Well, I needed to clear my head. Took a drive, ended up here.

405
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:36,079
我不是想在你的大日子打扰你
I didn't mean to bother you on your big day.

406
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,779
我有时间，克罗伊要来接我
I got a little time. Chloe's picking me up.

407
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:41,949
进展可真快，你的车怎么了？
That's very progressive. What happened to the truck?

408
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:45,187
做农活时坏了，你知道怎么回事
A farming accident. You know how it is.

409
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:48,198
资金筹备得怎么样了？
So how goes the bailout?

410
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:52,030
不好说，克拉克，我想在变好之前一定会更糟
I'm not sure, Clark. I think it's gonna get ugly before it gets better.

411
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,502
我爸爸拼命都不会让我成功的
My father's dead set against me succeeding.

412
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:57,036
为什么你爸爸这么抵触你的工厂？
Why would your father be against the plant?

413
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,871
我们的关系很复杂，克拉克
We have a complicated relationship, Clark.

414
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:03,481
我爸爸想让我相信，父子关系要互相信任 事实上却不是
My father wants me to believe it's built on trust, but it's not.

415
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:05,548
我们的父子关系只建立在谎言和欺骗上
It's built on lies and deceit.

416
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:09,153
任何这样的关系都注定要失败
Any relationship with that foundation is destined to fail.

417
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:12,984
- 幸运的是我们没有这样的问题 - 是幸运
-Lucky we don't have that problem. -Lucky us.

418
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:16,393
我想让你知道无论接下来的日子发生了什么
I want you to know whatever happens in the next few days...

419
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,655
我依然是你的朋友，永不改变
...I'm still your friend, and that's never gonna change.

420
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:23,494
- 我希望你也是这么想的 - 是的啊
-I hope you feel the same way. -I do.

421
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:25,727
你认为会发生什么
What do you think's gonna happen?

422
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:29,840
不知道，就是有种不祥的感觉
I don't know. Just got a bad feeling...

423
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:32,670
就像暴风雨来临前空气的那股味道
...like when you can smell the air change before a storm.

424
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:35,074
暴风雨是常发生的,莱克斯
Storms are a way of life around here, Lex.

425
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,011
只要别被它阻在路上
The trick is to not get caught out in the open.

426
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:40,515
照顾好自己
Look after yourself.

427
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
（惠特尼・佛得曼 最有价值球队组员，2002年度）

428
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:53,089
简直难以置信，我一直认为 我的一生就要在这些辉煌的奖杯上
It's hard to believe. I thought my whole life was in that trophy case.

429
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,756
但现在看起来，它们是那么微不足道
Now it all seems so trivial.

430
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:59,534
我们该送你到车站了
We should get you to the bus station.

431
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:04,935
汽车一小时后才离开
My bus doesn't leave for an hour.

432
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,106
去看看体育馆怎么样？
How about we go check out the gym?

433
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,280
好的
Okay.

434
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:26,724
真漂亮
It's beautiful.

435
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,234
他们呢？
Where is everyone?

436
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:34,065
一小时后舞会开始, 筹备委员会的人都回家准备了
Hour before the dance, the setup committee goes home to get ready.

437
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,252
你因我错过了这场春季舞会
You're missing the spring formal because of me.

438
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:03,097
我们仍然有时间跳最后一只舞
We still have time for one last dance.

439
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:23,351
对不起，我没有提前把入伍的事告诉你
I'm sorry I didn't tell you before I enlisted.

440
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,449
你真得很勇敢
I think you're very brave.

441
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:38,296
我知道这很突然  你还不再确定我们的关系
I know this is kind of sudden, and you're not sure how you feel about us--

442
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:42,531
惠特尼，就跳舞吧
Whitney, let's just dance.

443
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:26,742
嗨
Hi.

444
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,044
你觉得怎么样，太艳吗？
What do you think? Too pink?

445
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:32,553
不，你…你真美
No. You-- You look beautiful.

446
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,916
谢谢，你把自己打扮得也很帅气
Thank you. You clean up nicely yourself.

447
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,751
红色领带呢？
What happened to the red tie?

448
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:40,221
直觉告诉我那样是错的.
Instinct told me it was the wrong way to go.

449
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:44,058
- 这是给我的吗？ - 是的
-Is that for me? -Oh, yeah.

450
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,927
哇哦
Oh, wow!

451
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,596
太漂亮了
It's beautiful.

452
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,436
我也给你带了礼物！
Oh, I have yours!

453
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:56,704
好的
Okay.

454
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:01,275
我扎到你了吗？
Oh, did I get you?

455
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:10,217
我们该走了
We should go.

456
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:12,363
耶，我们走吧
Yeah. Well, here we go.

457
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,398
- 我来开门 - 好的
-I'll get the door. -Okay.

458
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:20,128
-谢谢，看起来快要来暴风雨了 -没错
-Thanks. Looks like a storm's coming. -Yeah.

459
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:23,005
- 坐好了？ - 好了
-In? -In.

460
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:49,156
- 这太疯狂了 - 我知道
-This is crazy! -I know.

461
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,824
- 你还好吗？ - 快走吧
-You okay? -Let's go.

462
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,266
快到里面去
Let's get inside!

463
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:58,572
哇哦，你们看上去很不错
Wow, you guys look great.

464
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:01,678
谢谢，有眼光嘛，这是仿名牌的礼服
Well, thank you, Ms. Rivers. It's faux Wang.

465
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,336
- 嗨 - 嗨，埃瑞卡
-Hi. -Hi, Erica.

466
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,779
克罗伊，你能不能…？
Hey, Chloe, could you--?

467
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,783
- 他想让你给我们拍张照 - 好，当然可以
-He wants you to take our picture. -Oh, yeah, sure.

468
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:13,287
我马上回来，我想他是为了证明 终于有这么一天了
I'll just be a sec. I think he wants proof that this night actually happened.

469
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:19,028
- 就这样吧 - 祝你好运，惠特尼
-Well, I guess this is it. -Good luck, Whitney.

470
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,727
拉娜，我能单独跟克拉克待一会吗？
Lana, can I have a minute alone with Clark?

471
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:26,029
当然，我去把车开过来
Sure. I'll bring the truck around.

472
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,600
谢谢
Thanks.

473
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,472
你我这一年过得很怪异
You and I have had a weird year.

474
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:40,815
我开始以为你想从我手里 偷走拉娜
I started out thinking you just wanted to steal Lana.

475
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:46,987
我不是为了找借口 但我确实做了一些不光彩的事
I'm not trying to make excuses, but I did some things I'm not proud of.

476
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:49,456
对不起，克拉克
I'm sorry, Clark.

477
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,154
我接受了
I appreciate that.

478
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:59,167
克拉克，我想问你一些事 就当帮个忙
Listen, Clark, there's something I wanna ask you, a favor.

479
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:01,904
可以
Okay.

480
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:06,339
拉娜现在对我们的关系 还不是很确定
Lana's not sure how she feels about our relationship right now.

481
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,342
但我很确定
But I am.

482
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:14,041
我需要你在我回来之前照顾她
I need you to look after her until I get back.

483
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,882
我真不知道要说什么
I really don't know what to say.

484
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:20,319
说可以
Say yes.

485
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,219
可以
Okay.

486
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,419
克拉克？
Clark?

487
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:31,692

祝你幸运
Good luck.

490
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:02,722
刚才怎么了？
What was that all about?

491
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:06,393
说些男人的事情 我有说过你今晚非常漂亮吗？
Just guy stuff. Have I told you how beautiful you look tonight?

492
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:10,735
有啊，但经常提醒我会更好
Yeah, but frequent reminders are always appreciated.

493
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:27,653
东西都拿了？
Do you have everything?

494
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:31,453
- 只让带一个包 - 看来我不适合当海军战士
-You're only allowed one bag. -I'd never make it as a Marine.

495
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:41,297
这个给你，会带来好运

-This is one of Chloe's favorite songs. -Why do you think I requested it?

509

你就是那个威胁克拉克的记者！
You're the reporter who threatened Clark!

517
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:01,042
- 别动手！ - 为什么不？他想杀我们儿子！
-Don't do anything! -Why not? He tried to kill our son.

518
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,017
- 是你引爆了那辆卡车吧？ - 我知道那样不会伤害到他
-Did you blow up that truck? -I knew it wouldn't hurt him.

519
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:05,314
别，求你了！

The bus station's south of town. Lana's there.

542
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:30,544
别担心，我相信她已经到家了
Don't worry. I'm sure she's home by now.

543
00:39:30,714 --> 00:39:34,241
我来给她打个电话，你在这等我
You know what? I'll go call her on my cell, and you wait here.

544
00:39:38,822 --> 00:39:40,585
克拉克？
Clark?

545
00:39:42,993 --> 00:39:44,984
克拉克？
Clark?

546
00:39:55,005 --> 00:39:56,563
该死的，尼克松！
Damn you, Nixon!

547
00:39:57,841 --> 00:40:01,174
你准备用你妈妈的股份 来资助你的收购
So you're using your mother's stock to fund the buyout.

548
00:40:01,345 --> 00:40:02,778
这是你的秘密资金来源
That's your secret source.

549
00:40:02,946 --> 00:40:06,541
我必须承认，这是一项大胆的举措 莱克斯，但是这没用
I must admit, it's a bold move, Lex, but it won't work.

550
00:40:06,717 --> 00:40:09,686
- 你冒着龙卷风的危险来告诉我这个？ - 这是自杀，莱克斯
-You braved the weather to tell me that? -It's suicide, Lex.

551
00:40:09,853 --> 00:40:13,687
你也许能拿回工厂 但你在拿自己工人的家庭做赌注
You may get the plant, but you're putting your employees' homes on the line.

552
00:40:13,857 --> 00:40:15,347
也可能摧毁你自己的未来
Forfeiting your own future.

553
00:40:16,026 --> 00:40:18,586
或者创造一个远离你掌控的新命运
Or forging a new destiny free from you.

554
00:40:20,364 --> 00:40:23,162
你不是我的敌人，你是我儿子
You're not my enemy. You're my son.

555
00:40:24,201 --> 00:40:26,635
我没看出两者有什么差别
I never saw the distinction.

556
00:40:26,803 --> 00:40:29,431
亚历山大大帝快死的时候，他的将军问他…
When Alexander the Great was dying, his generals asked...

557
00:40:29,606 --> 00:40:31,631
准备把他的帝国留给谁…
...who he would leave his empire to...

558
00:40:31,808 --> 00:40:36,871
…他是否能任命一个继承人 一个能完整保留遗产…
...if he would appoint a successor who would keep the legacy intact...

559
00:40:37,047 --> 00:40:39,709
并能避免一代代流血事件的人
...prevent generations of bloodshed.

560
00:40:39,883 --> 00:40:42,283
他的回答很简单:“我将它留给强者”
His answer was simple: "I leave it to the strongest."

561
00:40:42,452 --> 00:40:45,717
我相信这话意思是:“鼓动浩劫，随时开战”
I believe the term is, "Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war."

562
00:40:45,889 --> 00:40:49,325
我要埋葬你，以及斯摩维尔里 所有站在你那边的人
I'll bury you and everyone in Smallville who takes your side.

563
00:41:06,843 --> 00:41:08,902
不！
No!

564
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,309
莱克斯！
Lex!

565
00:41:20,357 --> 00:41:22,222
莱克斯！
Lex!

566
00:41:23,093 --> 00:41:24,219
莱克斯！
Lex!

567
00:41:26,096 --> 00:41:28,087
帮帮我，莱克斯！
Help me, Lex!

568
00:41:28,265 --> 00:41:29,323
莱克斯！
Lex!

569
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,034
我动不了！
Can't move!

570
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:37,836
救救我！
Help me!

571
00:41:42,712 --> 00:41:44,043
莱克斯！
Lex!

572
00:41:45,982 --> 00:41:49,247
儿子，求你！
Son, please!

573
00:42:11,808 --> 00:42:13,537
该死的！
Damn it!

574
00:42:31,328 --> 00:42:32,488
克拉克！
Clark!

575
00:42:32,662 --> 00:42:33,754
拉娜！
Lana!

576
00:42:33,997 --> 00:42:35,794
克拉克！
Clark!

577
00:42:40,136 --> 00:42:41,865
不！
No!

578
00:42:49,547 --> 00:42:50,947
