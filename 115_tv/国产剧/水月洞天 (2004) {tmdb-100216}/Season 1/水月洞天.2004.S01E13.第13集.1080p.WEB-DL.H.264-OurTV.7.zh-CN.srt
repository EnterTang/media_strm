1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,910
《十三号仓库》前情提要
Previously on warehouse 13

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,710
几年前  我发誓你说过
Years ago, I swear you said

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,550
你不过是个普通教授
You were just a simple professor.

4
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,150
漏说了这个装满神奇藏物的最高机密仓库
You left out the top-secret warehouse full of madcap.

5
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,020
克劳迪娅  你就是入侵者
Claudia. You're the breach.

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,350
芝麻开门
Knock knock.

7
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,560
你的哥哥约书亚来找你
Your brother Joshua visits you

8
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,190
跟你说他没死
And tells you he's not dead?

9
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,630
帮我把他救回来
Help me bring him back.

10
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,200
谢谢你没放弃
Thanks for not giving up.

11
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,000
克劳迪娅知道了太多关于仓库的事
Claudia learned a great deal about the warehouse,

12
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,170
她会成为隐患
Which could become problematic.

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,570
你知道该怎么办
You know what the options are.

14
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,870
曼哈顿岛  四百年前
Manhattan Island, Four Hundred Years Ago

15
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,900
上帝降临之时
When He comes

16
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,700
让这些元素成为他的力量
Let these elements be his strength

17
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,500
和我们的希望
and our hope.

18
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,900
纽约城  现代
New York City, Present Day

19
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:22,920
还有这个
And this.

20
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,720
什么藏物能干出这种事
What artifact did that?

21
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,850
还是说那就是藏物
Or is that the artifact?

22
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,190
出自一位鲜为人知的雕刻家
It was created by a little-known sculptor

23
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,290
沃尔特・伯利
Walter Burleigh,

24
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,590
昨晚被盗
And it was stolen late last night

25
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,690
地点是纽约一家高档拍卖行
From a high-end auction house in New York.

26
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,160
不过问题并不在此
But that's not the issue.

27
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,330
问题在于它是怎么被盗的  因为...
The issue is how this thing was stolen, because...

28
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,530
我只不过想弄明白
I'm trying to figure out why

29
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,400
为什么我才刚回到这个世界
After I just got back into this world

30
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,140
你就迫不及待地要把我扫地出门
You're in such a rush to shove me out the door.

31
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,340
因为我花半辈子把你救出来
Because I didn't spend half my life trying to save your life

32
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,370
不是让你回来上网看视频的
So you could surf the net and watch youtube.

33
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,040
抱歉  我不过想补习过去十二年的时事
Well, excuse me for trying to catch up on current events

34
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,250
和全球形势罢了
And the state of the world in the last 12 years.

35
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,350
拜托  我们在工作
Hey, we're working.

36
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,350
就在这里
We're working right here.

37
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,520
阿迪  抱歉
Artie, I'm sorry,

38
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,120
但我得找份工作
But apparently I have to find a job.

39
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,590
而且我不知道该怎么
Don't know exactly what I'm gonna put

40
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,750
在简历里把这段空白补上
In that little gap in my resume.

41
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,390
那就把你怎么走的经过写上去啊
Well, hey, what about what got you there in the first place?

42
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,720
-你  -干嘛
- You!  - What?

43
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,190
你没事可做吗
Don't you have something to do?

44
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,420
比如去联邦监狱待着
Like stay out of federal prison?

45
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,230
你不是应该给我写份
And aren't you supposed to be writing me

46
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,850
完整技术图
A full technical schematic

47
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,460
说明你是如何入侵仓库的吗
On how you racked my warehouse?

48
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,330
伙计  就在楼上  快写完了
Yeah, buddy. It's upstairs. It's almost finished.

49
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,700
那好  我要你马上写完它
Well then, I want you to finish it,

50
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,800
每个重定向和反斜线符都标清楚
And I want every redirect and every backslash.

51
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,040
去  马上
Go. Now.

52
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,670
写完之后  你就去仓库
And then after that, you're going into the warehouse

53
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,240
把你进来时弄断的线
And you're gonna re-wire what you unwired

54
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,740
重新接上
When you broke in.

55
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,010
我想把你也弄断
I'd like to unwire you.

56
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,490
小脚轻快的脚步声
The patter of little feet.

57
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,590
那么  阿迪
All right, so, Artie,

58
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,360
一个恶心的雕像被盗
Somebody boosts an ugly sculpture.

59
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,460
跟我们有什么关系
Why does that involve us?

60
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,190
关键在于
Okay, what is significant here

61
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,730
这东西是怎么被盗的
Is how this thing was stolen.

62
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,700
这起盗窃案根本不可能发生
I mean, this theft was...impossible.

63
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,030
有高端报警系统
There was a high-end alarm system,

64
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,070
八英寸厚的墙壁
Eight-inch thick walls,

65
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,330
密封的储藏室
Sealed vault.

66
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,900
上一秒雕像还在
So one second that sculpture was there,

67
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,640
下一秒就没了
Next second gone.

68
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,110
但也只是一起精心策划的艺术品盗窃案
But it's still just a well-executed art theft.

69
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,780
它可没有大叫着"仓库"
I mean, it doesn't automatically shout "warehouse,"

70
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,880
对吗
Does it?

71
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,710
没有东西会叫喊着"仓库"
Things rarely shout "warehouse."

72
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,580
它们都是小声嘀咕
They usually whisper,

73
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:04,050
"这可奇怪了"
"Hey, that's a little odd."

74
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,850
它们就是那样
That's what they do.

75
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,650
我也可能出错  也许没问题
Well, I could be wrong. I mean, it could be nothing.

76
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,020
但我很可能是对的
But I'm probably not wrong.

77
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,090
上次我弄错是1987年6月
Last time I was wrong was 1987, June.

78
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,090
等等  说那事
Stop right there. That.

79
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,160
我想听那件事
I want to hear more about that.

80
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,510
没门  出发
Not a chance. Go.

81
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,260
好的
Okay.

82
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,140
我们走
Here we go.

83
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,580
走喽
Going.

84
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,270
走  快走
Go, go, go, go.

85
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,810
阿迪
Hey, Artie.

86
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,510
你知道我爱纽约
Hey, uh, you know I love New York.

87
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,850
-很棒的城市  -那是
- Oh, a great town.  - It is.

88
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,450
所以我想
So I was just thinking

89
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,370
也许你能弄点
Maybe you guys could kick down some

90
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,220
演出门票或是...
Tickets to a show, or...?

91
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,390
那得看是什么演出了
Well, it depends on the show.

92
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,590
-真的  -假的  快滚
- Really?  - No. Get out of here.

93
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,560
演出
Show.

94
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,860
好像你还有时间
Like you're even gonna have time

95
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,860
看那傻兮兮的音乐剧
For a stupid musical.

96
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:45,090
还得让我掏钱
Or that I'd even pay for it.

97
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,630
非百老汇的剧又不是很贵
Off Broadway's not that expensive.

98
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,800
纽约
New York

99
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,670
克鲁瑟拍卖行
Carruther's auction house

100
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,340
向来以保安水准为荣
Pride itself on security.

101
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,580
这桩盗窃案真是难倒我们了
This theft has us stumped.

102
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,520
监控录像什么也没拍到
Video surveillance shows nothing.

103
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,520
我想你们用的电子门锁
I'm assuming you use an electronic lock

104
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,350
会记录一切活动
That records all activity.

105
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,250
记录显示门根本没开过
And it says the door never opened.

106
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,460
谁是卖家
Who's selling the piece?

107
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,590
一位地产商
Private estate.

108
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,960
他决定要拍卖
He decided to auction

109
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,360
在他接触过两个买家之后
After he was approached by two interested parties,

110
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,930
都是大买家
Both with deep pockets.

111
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,300
拍卖时间是什么时候
When is this auction, uh, scheduled?

112
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,460
本来是今天
It was for today.

113
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,100
不好意思  你们能不能转个身
Uh, I hate to ask, but would you mind?

114
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,440
也许其中一位买家
You know, maybe one of these interested parties

115
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,650
厌恶竞争
Hates competition.

116
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,410
这么说这位买家
Which would mean that said party

117
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,920
借用藏物的神力
Has an artifact that lets them pull off

118
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,350
来做个了结
An impossible heit.

119
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,050
要么简单的答案是
Or the simple answer,

120
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,530
有内贼
An inside job.

121
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,790
她确实值得好好调查
She does bear scrutiny.

122
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,160
跟我来
Follow me.

123
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,660
好的  女士
Yes, ma'am.

124
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,300
她跟你不是一类人
She's out of your league.

125
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,100
你知道我这类人是怎样的吗
How do you know what my league is?

126
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,500
我可没问阿迪要
Not that I ask for them,

127
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,270
可我就是有季赛门票
But I've got season tickets.

128
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,140
太棒了  我喜欢
That's good. I like it.

129
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,740
盗贼偷走的那件工艺品
So the thief take one piece.

130
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,580
是这里最值钱的吗
Was it the most valuable one in here?

131
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,520
那倒不是
Oh, far from it.

132
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,130
但青菜萝卜各有所爱
But there's no accounting for taste.

133
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,550
说不好
Oh, I don't know.

134
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:54,420
有些东西就是经典
Some things are just classic.

135
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,190
皮特
Pete.

136
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,050
能过来一下吗
Come here for a second?

137
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,460
不如我待在储藏室
Why don't I, uh, stay here in the vault

138
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,330
来处理这些"仓库的事"
And look for anything, you know, "warehousey",

139
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,160
你去查查那两个买家好吗
And you go check out those two interested parties?

140
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,400
我们一起行动
Well, wouldn't things go quicker

141
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,460
效率不是会高一些吗
If we just worked together?

142
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:11,130
要是你在泡妞儿的话  就不会快
Well, not if you're on a date.

143
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,940
这样的话我们能双管齐下
Look, this way we can cover twice as much ground,

144
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,370
你甚至能赶得及
And maybe you'll even get done in time

145
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,610
请短裙美女去看演出
To take, uh, skirt girl to a how.

146
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,040
两个有兴趣的买家  是吗
Two interested parties, huh?

147
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,710
我去拿他们的资料
I'll get their info.

148
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:25,010
好极了  我和你一起去
Great. I'll, uh, go with.

149
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,200
各就各位
Batter up.

150
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:40,930
拉蒂默探员
Agent Lattimer?

151
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,270
吉尔伯特・列本
Gilbert Radburn.

152
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,040
在很多建筑物上见过您的大名
Yeah, I've seen your name on a few buildings.

153
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,440
这就是我把名字刻在上面的原因
Good. That's why I put it up there.

154
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,700
需要我帮什么忙
What an I do for you?

155
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,470
您感兴趣的那件雕塑昨晚被盗了
You were interested in the sculpture that was stolen last night,

156
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,540
伯利的那件
The Burleigh?

157
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,510
是的
I was.

158
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,510
你可能会想
And as you might guess,

159
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,050
我讨厌失败
I'm not fond of losing.

160
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,280
特勤局到底想知道什么
What's the Secret Service's interest?

161
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,280
它是如何被盗的
How it was stolen.

162
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,150
也就是说
Which was?

163
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,520
能告诉我您昨晚在哪吗
You mind telling me where you were last night?

164
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:06,220
我可没必要去偷
Ha. I have no need to steal.

165
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,320
有时候倒不是为了偷
Well, sometimes it's not about stealing.

166
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,630
是为了征服感
You know, it's about conquering.

167
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,090
好比把您的名字刻在建筑物上
Like putting your name on a building.

168
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,800
我昨晚和朋友一起
I was with friends.

169
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,070
一整晚
All night?

170
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,230
这是个不夜城
This is the city that never sleeps.

171
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,240
需要名字吗
You want names?

172
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,610
那再好不过了
Yes, please. That would be swell.

173
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,880
您为什么对伯利的作品感兴趣
Also, why the Burleigh?

174
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,280
有什么特别之处吗
What's so special about it?

175
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,780
情人眼里出西施  拉蒂默探员
Eye of the beholder, agent Lattimer.

176
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,750
情人眼里出西施
Eye of the beholder.

177
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,150
好  我会把名字给你
Yeah, I'll get you those name.

178
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,120
谢谢您  先生
Thank you, sir.

179
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,820
探地雷达
Ground Penetrating Radar

180
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,400
怎么了
What's up?

181
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,100
赶紧过来
You should get back here.

182
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,800
查到什么了
You got something?

183
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,940
在一个木箱后面有发现
I found something behind one of the crates,

184
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:57,110
但你亲自过目会更说得清
But it's easier to show and tell.

185
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,370
是什么
What is it?

186
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,810
你肯定不会相信的  但是...
You're not gonna believe this, but...

187
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,810
我闻到"软糖"了
I smell fudge.

188
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,920
马上到
I'll be right there.

189
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,180
你说的那是什么
What are we talking about here?

190
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,450
就在这儿  你来看
Well, it's right here. You can see it.

191
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,290
看吧
Right?

192
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,390
搞什么鬼
What the hell?

193
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,960
好的
Okay.

194
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:22,330
慢慢来
Easy.

195
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,350
皮特  别
Pete, no.

196
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,350
不行
No.

197
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,720
藏物的神力
Artifact behavior

198
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,980
通常需要接触人体才能施展  对吗
Usually require a human element, right?

199
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,260
当心
Just be careful.

200
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,590
好的
Okay.

201
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,890
-好吗  -知道了
- Okay?  - Okay.

202
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,550
我的天啊
Oh, my god.

203
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,580
快看啊
Check it out.

204
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,650
不可思议
It's crazy.

205
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,410
这就是我最想拥有的藏物之一
Okay, you see this is one of those artifacts that I'd really like to keep.

206
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,700
皮特  放进来
Pete, put it in.

207
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,410
下面是见证奇迹的时刻
Hey, Rocky, watch me pull a rabbit out of my hat.

208
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,070
酷毙了
Now that's cool.

209
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,370
我就知道会这样
That's what I thought.

210
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,210
怎样  你掐我我会疼吗
What? That pinching cause pain?

211
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,580
不是  那个我知道
No. No, I know that.

212
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,690
这根羽毛
But the feather,

213
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,650
只能在肘以下部分起作用
It only works up to your elbow.

214
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,850
所以还不足以进来拿走雕像
So not enough to get in and out with the sculpture.

215
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,020
正是  所以这只是藏物的一部分
Exactly, which means that this is only part of the artifact.

216
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,090
还不是完整的
It's not the whole thing.

217
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,760
至少缩小范围了
Oh. At least that narrow it down.

218
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,960
目标是一只能穿墙走壁的
We're looking for an arts-dealing bird

219
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,230
买卖工艺品的鸟
That walks through wall.

220
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,000
正如阿迪所说
Like Artie always says...

221
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,200
别排除任何可能性
Never rule anything out.

222
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,440
给我看看
Show me.

223
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,940
好的
Okay.

224
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,480
像是印第安人的东西
Looks native American.

225
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,080
对  它应该是某件东西的一部分
Yeah, we think it fell off something larger,

226
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,720
仪式物品
A ceremonial object,

227
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,480
拐杖  和睦烟斗
A walking stick, a peace pipe maybe.

228
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,230
还有鸟
Or a bird.

229
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,460
对这东西的主人有线索了吗
Yeah. Any guesses to who this thing belonged to?

230
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,530
也许是那两个
Uh, well, maybe one of the two guys

231
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,100
雕塑买家的其中之一
Who wanted to buy the sculpture,

232
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,660
但还有一个我们还没问过话
But we haven't interviewed one of them yet.

233
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,700
拉本很富有  没必要冒险
Radburn's too rich to risk it.

234
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,230
他出手比唐纳德・特朗普还阔绰
He could outbid Donald Trump.

235
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,240
可以排除他的嫌疑
I think we an rule him out.

236
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,050
别排除任何可能性
N-never rule anything out.

237
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,010
那好
Okay, uh, well,

238
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,110
另一个买家也是有钱的主
The second guy's a rich dude.

239
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,110
叫做杰弗里・韦佛
His named is Jeffrey Weaver

240
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,540
杰弗里・韦佛
Jeffrey Weaver

241
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,550
是亚历山大・韦佛的儿子吗
Is that the son of Alexander Weaver?

242
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,490
阿迪  亚历山大・韦佛是什么人
Um, Artie, who is Alexander Weaver?

243
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,350
曾经
Yeah, was.

244
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,220
他勒索钱财
He was an extortionist,

245
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:01,860
是个房地产骗子
A real estate swindler.

246
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,190
还是个文物破坏者
And a ravager of cultures.

247
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,760
绝非善类
Not a nice man.

248
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:07,930
已经死了
Now deceased.

249
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,070
对了
And...yes.

250
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:13,640
儿子杰弗里住在纽约
Son Jeffrey lives in New York.

251
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,670
所以...
So...

252
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:20,440
除非这小子和他父亲不是一丘之貉
Look, unless the acorn fell very far from the tree,

253
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,140
否则就得悠着点了
Watch your backs.

254
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,770
到底是哪个
Which one are you?

255
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,680
看看  是不是这个
Let's see. Is it that one?

256
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,580
别紧张  放松点
Chill, parky.

257
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,500
还好吗
Uh, how's it going?

258
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,420
你害怕我会把这房子给烧了吗
You mean are you scared I'm gonna burn the house down?

259
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,590
紧急出口标识得很清楚
Emergency exits are clearly marked.

260
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,160
你觉得我对你是假惺惺的吗
You think my concern for you is insincere?

261
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,060
我觉得你该把电缆剪递给我
I think you should pass me the cable shears.

262
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,260
那些就是
Those.

263
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,610
对继续生活感到不安吗
So...anxious to get on with your life?

264
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,470
令人震惊的洞察力
Such shocking insight.

265
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,770
我的气味告诉你的吗
Did my aura tell you that?

266
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,510
你把约书亚逼太紧了
You're certainly pushing Joshua.

267
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,790
他就要别人推一把
Only 'cause he needs it.

268
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,180
你对他有意思
Oh, you do have a thing for him.

269
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,380
你在扯开话题
You're changing the subject.

270
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,550
是你提起他的
You brought him up.

271
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,750
既然你把他救出来
Now that you've saved him,

272
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,760
你一生的工作也告终了
Your life's work is complete,

273
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,060
这让你很害怕
And that cares you.

274
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,580
所以你把自己的追求转嫁到他身上
So you're forcing your own need for a purpose onto him.

275
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,100
天才  不用催眠就说中了
Genius. And all done without a couch.

276
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,430
我得付你多少  弗洛伊德医生
How much do I owe you, Dr. Freud?

277
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,700
如果约书亚能有所成就
If Joshua accomplished great things,

278
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,710
那么你的牺牲也值了
Then your sacrifice is justified.

279
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,670
但你同样害怕孤单
But you're also afraid of being alone.

280
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,390
孤身一人
Truly alone.

281
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,810
反正我不喜欢你  随你怎么说
It's okay if I don't like you, right?

282
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,860
那是
Of course.

283
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,520
可你喜欢我
But you do.

284
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,390
杰弗里・韦佛寓所
Jeffrey Weaver's Penthouse

285
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,370
韦佛先生马上就过来
Mr. Weaver will be right with you.

286
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:00,930
谢谢
Thank you.

287
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,520
打电话给警察  案子破了
Call the cops. Crime solved.

288
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,280
这跟你们想的不一样
It's not what it looks like.

289
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,080
不是吗  因为看来
No? Because what it looks like

290
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,050
像是你私藏赃物
That you're in possession of stolen goods.

291

仔细看一看

295
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,320
这一件是火

296
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,430
被偷的那件是风

302
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,730

-你对那很在行吗  -不过是业余爱好

You wouldn't happen to be missing a feather would you?

321
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,040
也许是从一件
Maybe off something

322
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,720
能让你穿墙走壁的东西上掉下来的
that lets you walk through walls?

323
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,520
你刚说什么
What'd you just say?

324
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:34,220
你脸色可不好啊  杰弗里  
You got a lousy poker face there, Jeffy.

你仍属于嫌疑犯

327
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,740
拉赛尔  进来

328
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,700
站在那别动
Whoa. Hey. Hold it right there.

329
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,310
不要动  把手举起来
Don't move. Let me see your hands.

330
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,310
怎么了
What is it?

331
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,940
这位仁兄也在列本工地
This dude was at Redburn's Construction site.

332
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,880
是他  他当时瞪了我一眼
Yeah, he was giving me the stink-eye.

333
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,950
不要紧  他的名字叫拉赛尔
It's all right. His name is Lacell

334
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,310
他为我工作
He works for me.

335
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,650
我们来决定要不要紧 
We'll decide when it's all right, okay?

336
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,450
他也为列本工作
He also works for Radburn.

337
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,390
一言难尽
It's...it's complicated.

338
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:07,820
好  等等  你同时为韦佛和列本工作吗
Okay, wait. You work for Weaver and Radburn?

339
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,730
听着  拉赛尔没问题的
Look, Lacell's not the problem.

340
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:14,030
如果你所说的有人穿墙而入是真的
If what you said about someone walking through walls I true,

341
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,330
这件雕塑就不安全了
The sculpture isn't safe.

342
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,500
你认为他们下一步会来偷它  对吗
You think they're coming after this one next, don't you?

343
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,670
我们就在这里
We're standing right here.

344
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,340
我们能保护它
I think we got it covered.

345
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,710
谢了  但我自己就能保护好它
Thank you, but I can provide my own protection.

346
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,510
我们不是建议你
That's not an offer, okay?

347
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,080
如果有人穿墙而入
If somebody's walking through walls,

348
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,540
美国政府需要知道这个人是谁
The United States government

349
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,510
他是怎么做到的
needs to know who and how.

350
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,780
我能告诉你的就是  
All I can tell you I that

351
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,180
这件雕塑就是下一个目标
This sculpture is the next target,

352
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,920
所以请让我将它转移到一个安全的地方
So please let me move it to a secure location.

353
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,850
好的  请等一下
Okay, well, hold on.

354
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,490
看这是啥  小警徽
What's that, badgey? Hmm?

355
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,420
好的  抱歉
Oh, okay. Sorry.

356
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:44,460
小警徽说我们得跟雕塑在一起
Badgey says we stay with the sculpture.

357
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:48,700
它去哪  我们就去哪
So wherever it goes, we go.

358
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,740
别动  千万别动
No, no, no, no.

359
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:58,970
别动那盘还没下完的棋
Don't touch that in the middle of the game.

360
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,480
-你跟谁下  -我自己
- With whom?  - Myself.

361
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,150
白棋已经被黑棋逼到一个死角
White's been backed into a corner by black.

362
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,280
我在等灵光乍现的时刻
I'm waiting for a eureka moment

363
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,610
救白棋一命
To save white's butt.

364
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,310
等多久啦
Been waiting a while? Huh?

365
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,290
三个月了
Three months.

366
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:12,490
干嘛问这个
Why?

367
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,390
克劳迪娅仔细看过这盘棋了
Oh, Claudia was looking it over.

368
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,990
发现你处境艰难
Noticed you were in a bit of a pickle.

369
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,060
她发现我处境艰难
She noticed I was in a pickle.

370
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,060
那个小妖女在哪
Where is the little demon?

371
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,220
她在里面
Oh, she's in there.

372
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,430
她还有活要干  她…
She's got work to do. She...

373
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,470
阿迪  阿迪
artie...artie.

374
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,840
她只是在休息
She's taking a break.

375
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,570
她很累了
She's been working very hard.

376
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,040
我讨厌你这副表情
I hate that look.

377
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,380
-克劳迪娅  -又来了
- Claudia...  - Here it comes.

378
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,550
需要一个家
Needs a home.

379
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,840
这不是人道协会  她不是无家可归的小猫  
This is not the humane society. She's not a stray cat.

380
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,440
她不会留在这的
She's not staying here.

381
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,780
弗雷德里克夫人有些坐立不安了
Mrs. Frederic is getting antsy as it is.

382
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,920
我不是说让她留在这
I'm not suggesting she stay here.

383
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,890
阿迪  你可以给她牵线搭桥
Artie, you can pull strings...

384
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,750
麻省理工  加州理工
M.I.T., CalTech.

385
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,360
-拜托了  -她需要挑战

386
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,860
-是啊  -阿迪  她需要有人做伴
- Yeah.  - Artie, he needs people.

387
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,000
她已经有约书亚了 
She's got Joshua.

388
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,390
约书亚有自己的路要走
And Joshua's on his own path.

389
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,090
没错  他俩都很聪明
Yes, they're both brilliant,

390
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,060
但他是个科学家  而她是个实干家
But he's a researcher, and she's a doer.

391
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,270
她需要跟同类人在一起
She needs people like her.

392
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,870
跟她一样傲慢无礼  不合群  头脑发热
Brash, rude, anti-social, impulsive?

393
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,500
我们在说克劳迪娅  不是你
We're discussing Claudia, not you.

394
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:05,110
你在对我人身攻击
See, that's kind of a low blow.

395
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:08,140
你傲慢  无礼…
You're brash, rude...

396
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:09,280
你在干什么  不行  不行
What are you doing? No, no, no, no!

397
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,610
行  行  就是行
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

398
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,180
将军
Check.

399
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,960
我真该下地狱
I'll be damned.

400
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:24,990
也许吧  但这话不该由我来说
Well, maybe, but I'm not one to judge.

401
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,200
白棋赢了黑棋九步
White beats black in nine moves.

402
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,020
雕塑还好吗
Hey, is the sculpture okay back there?

403
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,290
它很好
Yes, it's fine.

404
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,860
我也很好  顺带说说
I'm...I'm fine too, by the way.

405
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,430
谢谢你的问候
Thank you for asking.

406
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:59,030
你能让那开车的家伙悠着点儿吗
Hey, would you tell chief leadfoot to take it easy?

407
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,300
还要多久才能到机场
And how much longer till we reach the airport, anyway?

408
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,610
皮特  一切正常吗
Pete, I everything okay?

409
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,550
皮特
Pete.

410
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,880
停车  快停车
Stop the truck. Stop the truck!

411
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:31,730
皮特  你还好吗
Pete, are you okay?

412
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:35,560
皮特  看着我
Pete, look at me.

413
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:36,770
快停下
Hey, stop!

414
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:39,740
皮特
Pete?

415
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,380
快叫一辆救护车
I need an ambulance right away.

416
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,910
皮特
Pete.

417
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,650
老搭档
Hey, partner.

418
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,290
感觉怎样
How are you feeling?

419
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,990
疼
Sore.

420
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,160
浑身都疼
Everywhere.

421
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,940
想吃曲奇
Need cookie.

422
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,300
你昏迷了好一阵子
You've been out for a while.

423
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,900
能想起什么来吗
Remember anything?

424
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,870
我身体里的分子重组
I had my molecule rearranged,

425
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,940
然后被推出了一辆正在行驶的卡车
And got shoved out the side of a moving truck.

426
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:22,580
差不多也就这些了
That about sums it up.

427
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,080
毫无疑问  你刚才一定想得头疼
Not surprisingly, it give you quite a headache.

428
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,580
我告诉了阿迪
You know, I told Artie what you said

429
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,650
你昏迷前跟我说的那件鹿皮大衣
About the buckskin coat before you passed out.

430
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,590
还有印第安造物神话
And the creation myth.

431
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:34,790
他在查着呢
He's doing his thing.

432
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,290
是啊  我不明白
Yeah, I don't get it.

433
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,290
他足可以去抢诺克斯堡[美国国家金库]
I mean, this guy could be robbing Fort Knox.

434
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,930
为什么要偷雕塑
Why the sculpture?

435
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,490
这就是我们要解的谜团  不是吗
Guess that's our little puzzle, isn't it?

436
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,370
是那个帅哥
Mm. The pretty boy.

437
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,780
他来这干什么
What is he doing here?

438
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:03,080
杰弗里让你做了免费全身检查
Jeff got you a free, multi-point inspection.

439
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:06,320
确保你身体的每个部位都正常
Make sure all your part are where they belong.

440
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,650
原来是杰弗里
Oh, Jeff did.

441
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,120
没错  是他
Yes, Jeff did.

442
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,690
这家医院归他所有
He, um, owns the hospital,

443
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,900
是他盖的还是怎样
Or built it or something.

444
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,600
那可真是手到擒来
Well, that's handy.

445
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,570
他邀请我吃晚餐
He asked me to dinner.

446
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,270
-现在都凌晨三点了  -医院的餐厅
-It's 3:00 a.m.  - well, in the cafeteria.

447
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,870
-有钱人啊  -但我拒绝了
- Big spender.  - But I said no.

448
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,970
你应该去的
Ah, you should go.

449
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,110
不  我应该跟你在一起
No, I should stay here with you.

450
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,250
-不  -皮特
- Nah. No.  - I mean, Pete...

451
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,750
-麦卡  -皮特
- Myka.  - Pete.

452
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:36,650
这家伙了解底细
This guy knows what's going on.

453
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,850
你该去的
Go for it.

454
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,820
用上你的美人计
You know, use your feminine wiles.

455
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:41,690
微笑
Smile.

456
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,090
你笑起来的样子很好看
You're pretty when you smile.

457
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,960
真的吗
I am?

458
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:49,760
真的
Yeah.

459
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:54,930
你的意思是我不笑会怎样
So what does that mean when I'm not smiling?

460
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,770
挺吓人的
Kind of frightening.

461
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,370
头部伤口疼  护士快来
Head injury. Nurse.

462
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,720
不会是因为我说过的话才走吧
Something I said?

463
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:13,150
我正想去告诉你
I was just gonna come tell you.

464
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,890
我就在这呢
Here I am.

465
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,890
没错  你说得对
Yeah, you were right.

466
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,360
我必须走
I have to go.

467
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,930
一百八十度大转弯啊
Zero to 180.

468
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,260
我不是让你今天就走
I didn't mean today.

469
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:26,270
我只不过在用激将法
I was just looking for some forward momentum.

470
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:30,040
我知道  阿迪打了几个电话
Yeah, well, Artie made a few calls.

471
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,710
欧洲核子研究中心有一个职位空缺
And, uh, there's a position at CERN.

472
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:32,810
我该去的
I should take it.

473
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:35,740
是千载难逢的机会
It's once in a lifetime.

474
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:37,240
你要去瑞士吗
You're going to Switzerland?

475
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,510
-没错  -跟原子打交道
- Yeah.  - Smashing atoms?

476
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,650
正如你说的
Like you said,

477
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:41,180
我不能把余生都浪费在
Can't spend the rest of my life

478
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:44,150
上网和听斯普林斯汀的歌上面
Listening to Springsteen and surfing the web.

479
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:53,260
如果两个空间之间的壕沟
If an inter-dimensional rift

480
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,930
都不能阻止你我相见
Can't keep me from being in touch with you,

481
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,630
区区几千英里可以吗
You think a few thousand miles will?

482
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,870
你给我小心点
Well, you better.

483
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,300
我已经说得很清楚了
Because I think I've demonstrated

484
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:01,840
我会穷追到底的
I will hunt you down.

485
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,740
知道
Yeah.

486
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,310
过来抱抱
Well, come here.

487
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,880
高兴点
Come on.

488
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,280
皮特没事了  但其他人可能会受伤
Pete's fine, but somebody else could get hurt.

489
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,920
那件鹿皮大衣是从哪里来的
I mean, where does that buckskin coat come from?

490
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:20,690
它跟雕塑到底有什么联系呢
Is it connected to the sculpture somehow?

491
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,890
有成千上万
There are hundreds

492
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,390
关于这些印第安人造物的传说
Of these Native American creation myths.

493
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,660
我知道  我知道
I know, I know.

494
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,130
我还是认为那根羽毛
I still think that the feather, however,

495
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,560
是最好的线索
Gives us our best clue.

496
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:30,460
羽毛主要是被
Anyway, the feather was predominantly used

497
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,670
一些特拉华的部落所用
By the Delaware nations,

498
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,470
还有被...
And also by the...

499
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,370
对了  雷纳佩部落
Aha. By the Lenape tribe.

500
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:41,210
是他们把曼哈顿卖给了荷兰人
They're the one who sold Manhattan to the Dutch

501
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,610
换回价值二十四美元的艺术品和手工制品
For 24 bucks worth of arts and craft.

502
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,150
可真不是笔好买卖
That's not a great deal.

503
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,450
话可不能这么说
You had to be there.

504
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,520
根据雷纳佩部落的传说
And according to Lenape legend,

505
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:51,590
世界是由四种元素的灵魂所创造
The world was created through the spirits of four elements.

506
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:54,150
四种  火  赐予我们灵魂
Four. Fire, which gave us our soul.

507
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,520
风  赐予我们呼吸
Wind, our breath.

508
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,960
水  带来死亡
Water, death.

509
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,960
太奇妙了
It's fascinating.

510
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:00,390
还有岩  它赐予世界...
And rock, which have the w...

511
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:03,460
琳娜
Leena.

512
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:09,400
岩赐予世界具体形态
Rock gave the world...solidity.

513
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:14,540
所以拥有鹿皮大衣的人就可以控制形态
So someone has a buckskin coat that manipulate solidity.

514
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:15,000
不会吧
No.

515
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,380
我觉得这整件事有一种规律
I think that this whole thing could be a pattern.

516
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:21,210
如果存在可以控制其他元素的物品
Because if there are artifact that control the other elements,

517
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,880
一旦有人获得了这些物品
And somebody were to acquire those artifacts,

518
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,720
这个人就可能拥有
That somebody would have

519
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,830
无穷大的力量来...
Immense power over...

520
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,460
控制世界
The world.

521
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,920
这危险可不小
At the risk of sounding dramatic.

522
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,260
你可从没被这些东西吓到
That's never stopped you before.

523
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:34,260
那是当然
That's true.

524
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,000
妈妈
Mama?

525
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,320
皮特  干嘛这么久才接
Pete, what took you so long?

526
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:05,890
听着
Uh, listen.

527
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,060
杰弗里・韦佛
Jeffery Weaver...

528
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:10,560
这个人需要重新调查
I think that that guy needs a second look.

529
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:12,800
麦卡正在调查他
Myka's taking a look at him now

530
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:15,470
还一边吃着干火鸡  蔬菜糊
Over dried turkey, mushy vegetables,

531
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,000
还有木薯布丁
And tapioca pudding.

532
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,510
好的  你还在医院吗
Okay. You're still in the hospital?

533
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:21,240
我从一辆铁皮货车里被丢了出来
I got pushed out of the side of a steel truck.

534
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,380
我在疗伤
I'm recuperating.

535
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,640
好的  等会儿再疗
Yeah, well, recuperate later.

536
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:25,250
趁麦卡支开了韦佛
While Myka's keeping Weaver busy,

537
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:28,680
我要你去搜查他的公寓
Uh, I'm gonna need you to toss his apartment.

538
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,620
他为什么要偷自己的东西
Why steal his stuff from himself?

539
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:32,650
故布疑阵吗
Weave our guy?

540
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,760
告诉我你发现了些什么
Well, tell me what you find out,

541
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,760
我就告诉你
And I will let you know.

542
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:48,370
这真浪漫
It's very romantic.

543
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,840
我让弗娜把蒸汽保温餐桌打开
I had, uh, Verna turn up the steam tables.

544
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,170
图得就是个气氛
It's all about atmosphere.

545
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,480
你很懂得如何讨女孩子欢心
Well, you sure know how to wow a girl.

546
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,180
这可是我的绝招
It's my best move.

547
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:02,950
你怎会进了特勤局呢
So what made you join the Secret Service?

548
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:09,290
要么进那里要么进监狱
It was either that or prison.

549
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,410
开玩笑的
I'm kidding.

550
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:13,160
那你呢
What about you.

551
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:16,530
你到底是做什么的
I mean, what is it you do exactly?

552
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,570
拿债券利息
Accrue interest.

553
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:19,670
再投资
Re-invest.

554
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:20,900
想用钱做些善事
Try to do something good with it.

555
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,300
活得很滋润嘛
That's a nice life.

556
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:26,040
这得看你是怎么得到这一切的
Yeah, well, it depends on how you got it.

557
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,370
你的父亲
Your father.

558
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,910
我的父亲  没错
My father, yeah.

559
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,310
而你不想
And you don't...

560
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,980
你不想重蹈他的覆辙
You don't want to follow in his footsteps.

561
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,880
是这样吗
Is that it?

562
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:38,080
我想推翻他走过的路
I want to erase his footsteps.

563
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,720
怎么了
What?

564
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,520
怎么了
What?

565
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,990
我只是在想
I'm just trying to decide

566
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,120
我面前坐着的是个好人还是坏人
If I'm sitting here with a good guy or a bad guy.

567
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:53,970
你知道几年前谁是列本的生意伙伴
You know who was in business with Radburn years ago?

568
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,840
另外一个想要雕塑的人
The other guy who wanted the sculpture?

569
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,270
是的  杰弗里・韦佛的父亲
That's right. Jeffery Weaver's father.

570
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:01,010
他们俩那时拼命
And both those guys tried to push really hard at that time

571
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,010
想卖掉这四座雕像
To sell them, all four of the sculptures.

572
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,440
我知道了
Yeah.

573
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,110
他们干了什么
What do they do?

574
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,150
我不知道
I don't know.

575
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,680
但我猜
I guess, you know,

576
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,780
当把四座雕像摆在一起时  就会有事发生
Something happens when you put all four sculptures together.

577
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:12,020
很可能是
My best guess, something...

578
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,450
坏事
Bad.

579
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,020
是的  坏事
Bad. Something bad.

580
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:16,360
在他住所有所发现吗
You find anything at Weaver's yet?

581
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,560
还没有
No, I don't know.

582
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,390
这房子很平常
This place is clean.

583
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,960
如果他有那件大衣  他很可能...
If he's the guy with the coat, he probably...

584
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:30,440
-老天  -怎么了
- Oh, come on.  - What?

585
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,310
可能没什么  我过会打给你
It's probably nothing. I'll call you back.

586
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:34,470
不  等等  怎么了
No, no, no. wait, wait. What?

587
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,940
开玩笑  太简单了
You got to be kidding me. What a hack.

588
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,810
找到了
Bingo mania.

589
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:55,600
你们到底在找什么东西
So what are you really after in all this?

590
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:58,630
别找政府做借口唬我
And don't tell me the government needs to know.

591
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,330
我是为那件大衣而来的
I'm here for the coat.

592
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,040
是的  政府想要它
And, yeah, the government actually does want it.

593
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,540
有些东西
There are certain things

594
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:08,170
不该让它在世间流传
That just shouldn't be out in the world.

595
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,390
我同意
True.

596
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:14,410
但你只对雕塑感兴趣
But, you, you're only interested in the sculptures.

597
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,850
为什么
Why?

598
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,750
它们并不那么值钱
They're not that valuable.

599
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,320
我认为一起创造出来的事物
I think things that were created together

600
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:20,290
就该在一起
Belong together.

601
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,290
不管是谁干的
Whoever's doing this,

602
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,220
你还没排除嫌疑
And I haven't ruled you out yet,

603
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:26,090
我也在收集它们
I was also collecting them.

604
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,020
如果四个雕塑聚齐  会发生什么
What happens when the four sculptures are together?

605
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:33,670
说实话  杰弗里  你该告诉我
Seriously, Jeff, you should tell me,

606
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:36,070
在某人...
Before somebody...

607
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,910
失陪一下
Just give me a seond.

608
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,950
皮特  你没事吧
Pete? Is everything okay up there?

609
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:46,480
没事  我在韦佛的家里
Yeah, I'm at Weaver's.

610
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:49,320
什么  你为什么...
What? Wh? What are you

611
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:52,150
他有间密室  算是伯利的祭坛
The guy's got a secret room that's a shrine to Burleigh.

612
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,250
他一定把伯利碰过的东西都买下了
He must have bought up everything the guy ever touched.

613
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,620
有一点可以肯定
Whatever's going on,

614
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:57,760
你男朋友脱不了干系
Your boyfriend's neck deep in it.

615
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:01,760
我会处理的
I'll wrap this up then.

616
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,400
我们该上楼了吧
So we should probably head upstairs, huh?

617
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:09,480
我倒宁可去你家坐坐
You know, I'd really rather go back to your place.

618
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:12,740
好笑的是
You know, it's funny.

619
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:15,170
通常美女对我说这话  我都会心花怒放
I usually like it when a beautiful woman says that.

620
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,610
确实挺好笑
That is funny. That is funny.

621
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,710
我最恨的就是我的男友欺骗我
Because I never like it when my date lies to me.

622
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:31,220
跟你说
You know,

623
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:36,710
伯利娶了个雷纳佩族姑娘
Burleigh was married to a Lenape woman.

624
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,880
而那些雕像
And the sculptures

625
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:42,520
就像把钥匙
Are some kind of a key

626
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,180
通往一个神圣地洞
To a sacred, underground cave.

627
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,550
通往一个神圣的什么
To a sacred what?

628
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,510
地洞
A cave.

629
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:49,510
据说洞里有四样
Uh, it says it ontains four offerings

630
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,080
献给造物主的贡品
To the spirit of creation.

631
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:53,610
他把这个地洞的地点
Somehow he hid the diretions to the cave

632
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,380
藏在了雕像中
In the culptures.

633
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:57,480
所以那四座雕像
So those four sculpture,

634
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,590
是张地图
See, they're a map.

635
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,120
如果集齐四个雕像
If you put the four sculptures together,

636
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:03,520
就能知道地洞在哪里
They tell you where this cave is.

637
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:05,260
是的  但该怎么做  阿迪
Yeah, but how, Artie?

638
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:07,230
我们漏了什么
I mean, we're missing something.

639
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,830
列本先生  我们发现这人想闯进来
Mr. Radburn, we found this man trying to break in.

640
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,770
你是拉赛尔吧
It's Lacell, right?

641
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:19,300
你在我这里的工作是什么  拉赛尔先生
What do you do for me, Mr. Lacell?

642
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:21,540
地质勘测  先生
Geological surveys, sir.

643
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,710
是的  你负责察看地下有什么
That's right. You see what's underground, don't you?

644
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:29,080
而你现在却溜到了半空中
And yet here you are, lurking very high above ground.

645
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,510
有何有趣的发现
Find anything interesting?

646
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,000
没有 先生
No, sir.

647
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:37,020
你不太会说谎  拉赛尔先生
You're not a very good liar, Mr. Lacell.

648
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:39,720
你为韦佛先生工作
And you work for Mr. Weaver.

649
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,820
别试图抵赖
Don't waste your breath with denial.

650
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:42,860
他戴着吗
Was he wearing it?

651
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:43,980
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

652
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,420
让我看看
Let me have it.

653
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,230
它是什么意思
Tell me about this.

654
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,470
无关紧要
It's nothing.

655
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,000
我父亲给我的
My father gave it to me.

656
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,610
你是说你舅舅吧
Don't you mean your uncle?

657
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:59,740
我说过了  你不擅长说谎
As I said before, deception is not your strong suit.

658
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:03,010
沃尔特・伯利是你舅舅  对吧
Walter Burleigh was your uncle, wasn't he?

659
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,580
不然你以为我为什么会请你
Why do you think that I hired you?

660
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:08,080
我曾希望你带我找到那个地方
I had hoped you would lead me to the place.

661
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:11,320
你舅舅把地洞的线索藏进了他的作品
Your uncle hid clue to the sacred cave in his art.

662
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:12,520
这是什么
What's this?

663
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:15,630
水  岩  风
Water, rock, wind.

664
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,460
很有用
Well, that's helpful.

665
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:22,730
我知道怎么排列雕塑位置了
Now I know how to arrange the sculptures.

666
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,770
在外面等我
Wait for me outside.

667
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,210
然后怎么做
But what then?

668
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,880
怎么才能起作用
How does it work?

669
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,480
它们怎样才能带我去那里
How will they lead me to the place

670
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,920
那个藏宝的地方
Where the objects are hidden?

671
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:39,540
我不知道
I don't know.

672
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:41,010
把镯子还给我
Give that back.

673
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,320
你已经得到你想要的了
You have what you want.

674
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,300
你想活着离开这里吗  拉赛尔
Do you want to leave here alive, Lacell?

675
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:53,670
还有吗
Oh, Is there more?

676
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:59,870
真相将于黎明时揭晓
"The truth is in the dawn."

677
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:06,710
这是什么意思
What does it mean?

678
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,740
我不知道
I don't know.

679
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,550
真相将于黎明时揭晓
"The truth is in the dawn."

680
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,520
这是什么意思
What does it mean?

681
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:22,120
我不知道
I don't know!

682
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:25,890
我不知道
I don't know.

683
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,000
我想你也不知道
I suppose you didn't know.

684
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,070
真相将于黎明时揭晓
"The truth is in the dawn.

685
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,840
真相将于黎明时揭晓
"The truth is in the dawn."

686
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:40,510
我不知道这什么意思
I...I don't know what that means,

687
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,910
伯利的笔记本上写满了这句话
But it's...it's written all over Burleigh's notes.

688
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,550
都写了什么
What's...what's written?

689
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:47,220
黎明
Uh...dawn.

690
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,720
这个我不懂
Thi...I mean, I don't know.

691
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:50,890
也许是指造物  
Uh, creation, maybe.

692
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:53,090
或是托尼・奥兰多的黎明乐队...
Tony Orlando and...

693
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,530
创造或毁灭
Creation...or destruction.

694
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:57,390
是的
Yeah.

695
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,630
阿迪  我们真的该相信这些东西吗
Look, Artie, how much of this stuff do we really believe?

696
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,470
如果他在找地洞  那我们就该相信
Well, enough that if he's looking for this cave,

697
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,800
而且要抢先他一步
It's better that we find it first.

698
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:09,060
我同意
I would agree with that.

699
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,980
你的搭档已经盯住我了
Your partner's already got me covered.

700
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:13,370
伙计  你快解释一下
Lucy, you've got some explaining to do.

701
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,810
密码在哪
So where's the code?

702
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,510
被吉尔伯特・列本捷足先登了
Gilbert Radburn beat me to it,

703
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,950
他也在找地洞
Same way he's been trying to find the cave.

704
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:19,210
什么地洞
What cave?

705
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,950
在地下的  神圣的  看看吧
Underground, sacred. Check it out.

706
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,320
我们必须阻止他
We have to stop him.

707
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:24,920
如你所说  有些东西
Like you said, there are some things

708
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:26,350
不该在世间流传
That should not be out in the world.

709
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:29,120
那个为你们俩工作的大个子呢
Yeah, well, what about that big guy that works for the two of you?

710
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:31,390
拉赛尔是雷纳佩人
Lacell is Lenape.

711
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,990
他也想保护那地洞
He want to save the cave too.

712
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,230
他在帮我监视着列本的挖掘工程
He's been my eyes at Radburn's digs.

713
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,300
他到现在还没联系我   估计大事不妙
He hasn't checked in either. I think something's happened.

714
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:40,440
我们必须先列本一步找到那个地洞
Okay, so we have to find this cave Before Radburn does.

715
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,800
如果他集齐四座雕像
Well, if he's got all four sculptures,

716
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:43,370
他可能已经在地洞里了
He could be there now.

717
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,310
我们手里有伯利所有的笔记
We've got all of Burleigh's note right here.

718
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:47,540
这不足以使我找到地洞
Well, that hasn't helped me solve it yet.

719
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:49,180
没错  韦佛先生
True, Mr. Weaver.

720
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,550
但你不是我
But...you're not me.

721
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:53,820
现在我们要赶在列本前
And right now we need to find the location of that cave

722
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,020
找到地洞
Before Radburn does.

723
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,230
真相将于黎明揭晓
The truth is in the dawn.

724
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,070
没错了  是张地图
Of course. It's a map.

725
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,390
谢谢了
Thank you.

726
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,730
伯利快要找到地洞的时候
So Burleigh stopped taking note

727
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,130
笔记也终止了
When he got close to finding the cave.

728
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,860
是的
Yeah.

729
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,270
就像是他意识到这个故事是真的
It's like he realize the stories were true

730
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:18,460
就停止了记录
And stopped writing anything down.

731
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,060
我想有这些就足够了
Well, you know, I think it may be enough

732
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,590
因为我找出了所有旧地图  我还...
Because I found all these old maps, and I...

733
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,810
芝麻开门
Knock knock.

734
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:26,240
你别打岔
I wish you wouldn't do that.

735
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:28,010
老天  这不好玩
God! Not funny.

736
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,380
等等
H...h...hang on.

737
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,590
我是回来拿工具的
I just came by to grab my tool

738
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,830
然后就踏上征程
And then I'm hitting the proverbial road.

739
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:33,200
我想去维加斯
I'm thinking Vegas.

740
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,770
真的吗  去维加斯  克劳迪娅
Really? Vegas, Claudia?

741
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,840
记住  押16  别押1
Remember, always hit on 16, never on 1."

742
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:39,510
那里一定有个雷纳佩族的聚居点
There's gotta be a lenape settlement here somewhere

743
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,910
一定是个安全的地方
And it's gotta be somewhere safe.

744
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:44,410
没错  他们找地方将特殊财产藏好
Yeah, and they'd look for a place with special properties.

745
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,280
那一定是个安全的地方
It's gotta be...it's gotta be somewhere safe.

746
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:48,780
那么  不是...
So...no, this is not...

747
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:50,620
你要干嘛
What...hey, hey!

748
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:54,660
伙计  你拿这些和远古龙脉比对过吗
Dude, have you considered matching these against magnetic ley line?

749
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,260
不  你别...
No, you don't...

750
00:35:57,330 --> 00:36:00,130
有一条的走向恰好沿着这座岛的东岸
One runs right along the east edge of the island.

751
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:05,930
就在这里
Right there.

752
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,450
这是南面的...
This is the south...

753
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:11,150
在曼哈顿下的一个地洞
An underground cave in Manhattan, huh?

754
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,820
如果这些年来  还没人
You know, if no one's run into it...

755
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:14,890
找到它的话  那我们可以排除
In all these year, then we can eliminate

756
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,790
那些主要的公共枢纽
Everywhere where they've dug for major utility junctions...

757
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,630
还有地铁  就是这里
And subways. This looks right.

758
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,280
错不了的
Indeed it does.

759
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:24,830
伙计们  我想我找到了  找到了
Guys, I think I've got it. I've got it.

760
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,270
它就位于洛伊赛德[下东区]
It is at Lower East Side.

761
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:30,070
也就是"克莱尔角"  就在...
Corlear's Hook. that is, um...

762
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:33,410
就在威廉斯堡大桥的南面
That is just south of the Williamsburg Bridge,

763
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,210
离河较近
And it's right near the water,

764
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,510
离地铁较远
And it's gotta be away from the subway lines.

765
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:41,460
克劳迪娅指出...
And Claudia pointed...out...

766
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,710
那个...
The...uh...

767
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,760
列本的大楼就在那里
Radburn's building there.

768
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:50,990
他到处在挖伯利考察过的地点
He's been digging everywhere that Burleigh focused

769
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,730
明修栈道  暗渡陈仓
Using new construction to over his hunt.

770
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,200
他快找到地洞了
Then he's close to finding it.

771
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,740
好了  阿迪  我们要出发了
Okay, Artie, we're heading out.

772
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,880
好的  抓紧时间
Yeah, okay, feel free to hurry.

773
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,530
好的
Yeah.

774
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:04,970
我要到那里去
All right, I need to get right here.

775
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,180
就在洞穴的旁边  需要多久
Right next to this cave. How long will that take?

776
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,580
我们能在五分钟内把那炸开
We can blow it in five minutes.

777
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:10,110
我要洞穴里的东西完整无缺
I need the contents of the cave to be intact.

778
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,250
所有东西原封不动
Nothing can be disturbed.

779
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:13,150
里面有东西吗
Contents?

780
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,580
如果进行精确爆破
Well, if it's a surgical blow,

781
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:17,290
能在它旁边炸开
I say we blast right here next to it

782
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:19,030
然后用手提钻从侧面钻开最后几英尺
And go sideways the last couple of feet by jackhammer.

783
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,480
你只要带我去洞边
You just get me next to that cave.

784
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,890
其他的我来处理
I'll take care of everything else.

785
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,890
-开工吧  -好的
- Let's go.  - Okay.

786
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,410
引爆
Fire in the hole!

787
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:33,050
好了  行动吧
All right, let's do it!

788
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:06,580
洞穴离那堵墙只有十八英寸
Your site's just 18 inches the other side of that wall.

789
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:08,020
我去找些人来钻洞
Let me get a couple guys with jackhammer.

790
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,650
任何人都不准过来  听懂没
No one come near here, you undertand?

791
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,150
这是真的
It's true.

792
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,050
全是真的
It's all true.

793
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,230
长生不老水
The water of eternal life.

794
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,150
赐我自然神力
He shall have the power of nature herself.

795
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,750
等等  等等
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

796
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:22,900
吉尔伯特・列本在哪
Gilbert Radburn. Where is he?

797
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,610
在引爆点  我要走了
Down in the blast site. But I'm getting out of here.

798
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,460
进去
Let's go.

799
00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:01,340
赐我百人之力
He shall have the strength of a hundred men.

800
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:09,020
赐我驾驭大地的力量
And he shall harness the strength of the earth.

801
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:16,710
你可够忙的啊
Hey, you kind of got your hands full, don't you?

802
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,560
别  吉尔
Don't, Gil.

803
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:20,830
你根本不知道自己在干什么
You don't know what you're dealing with.

804
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:23,070
你来晚了  杰弗
You're too late, Jeff.

805
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,670
这是我的使命
This is what I was meant to do.

806
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:26,470
-神经病  -不可理喻
- Nut bag.  - The nuttiest.

807
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:29,070
好了  列本  把箭放下
Okay, Radburn, drop the arrow.

808
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,680
把它放回去  吉尔  这不属于我们
Put it back, Gil. It's not for us.

809
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,750
也不是你的  杰弗  你太弱了
Not for you, Jeff. You're weak.

810
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,280
你父亲也是个窝囊废
And so was your father.

811
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:47,390
听我说
Listen to me.

812
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,120
你不知道你在干嘛
You don't know what you're doing.

813
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,990
第四个元素会完成转变
The fourth element completes the transformation.

814
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:54,800
那时我将所向披靡
Then nothing can stop me.

815
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:57,530
这地方做你的坟墓再合适不过了
How fitting that this place should be your tomb.

816
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:02,070
不要  这不是属于你的
No, no, no, it's not meant for you.

817
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,870
它们属于能够驾驭它们的强人
They are meant for the man who's strong enough to use them.

818
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,480
-芝麻开门  -老天  别闹了
- Knock knock.  - Oh, god. Don't do that!

819
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,140
永远都这么好玩  对吧
That just never stops being funny, Don't you think?

820
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:33,080
是啊  "永远"  你在干嘛
Oh, never. What are you doing...

821
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,550
在维加斯过得如何
What happened with Vegas?

822
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:36,720
-太简单了  -你不会
- It was too easy.  - You didn't.

823
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,750
弄了点零用钱
Just a little pocket money.

824
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,020
你不想上大学或者
Shouldn't you be in college or something?

825
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:43,960
不想和你同龄人待在一起吗
Don't you want to be with people your own age?

826
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,760
阿迪  我跟同龄人不一样
Artie, I'm not my own age.

827
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,100
得了
Come on.

828
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,130
写英语论文  参加兄弟会派对
Writing English paper and going to frat parties?

829
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,700
无聊死了
Bor-ing!

830
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,560
至少在这里  
I mean, at least here, you know,

831
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:55,100
还有些挑战性
There's, um... there's a challenge.

832
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:56,940
是很有挑战
That there is.

833
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,970
你准备好了吗
You up for it?

834
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:08,880
问题是  老头...
Question is, geezer...

835
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:15,520
你准备好了吗
Are you?

836
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:18,160
你太自不量力了
Oh, you are so out of your league.
