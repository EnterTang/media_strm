00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,960
《绝望主妇》前情回顾
Previously on Desperate Housewives

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,360
约翰  你只是个玩物  你和我没有未来的
John, you're a toy. You and me, no future.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:06,800
有些话一旦说出去
Once some things are said...

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,630
还记不记得一周工作60个小时是啥感觉
Remember what it's like to work a 60-hour week?

5
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,500
就收不回来了
...You can't take them back.

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,800
没有人比我更想找到黛德丽
No one cares as much about finding Deidre as I do.

7
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,240
-你射伤了自己  -听来挺蠢的是吧
- You shot yourself? - Pretty lame, huh?

8
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,940
后果已经无法挽回
The damage is already done.

9
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:20,470
妈妈
Mom!

10
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,210
-你不能把她从我身边抢走  -出去
- You're not taking her away from me. - Get out.

11
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,960
你得看点东西
I needed you to see something.

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,810
他们说是从麦克的车库偷来的
They said they stole it from Mike's garage.

13
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,410
那是血迹吗
Is that blood?

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,510
布里信从传统的价值观
Bree Van de kamp believed in old-fashioned values.

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,790
例如对于上帝的崇敬
Things like respect for god,

16
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,690
家庭的重要性
the importance of family,

17
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,000
和对国家的爱
and love of country.

18
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:51,450
实际上  布里对这些价值观太看重了
In fact, Bree believed so strongly in her values,

19
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,540
所以当她遇见不遵从这些价值观的人时
it was always a shock whenever she was confronted

20
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,980
就会很震惊
with those who didn't.

21
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,710
-不是我的  -你保证过不再出轨了
- It's not mine. - You promised the cheating had stopped.

22
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:03,710
雷克斯  你保证过的
Rex, You promised.

23
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:07,620
别大呼小叫的行吗  我今天都快烦死了
Could we not yell at each other? I'm feeling really lousy today.

24
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,910
你给我从家里滚出去
I want you out of the house.

25
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:12,020
布里  看着我  那不是我的
Bree, look at me. It's not mine.

26
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,280
那是谁的
Well then, whose is it?

27
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,600
它不可能自己跑到我的洗衣篮里吧
It didn't just magically appear in my laundry basket.

28
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,130
这家里又不是只有我一个
I'm not the only guy in this house

29
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:19,720
用避孕套的男人
that uses that hamper.

30
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,940
-不会吧  -很遗憾
- No! - Sorry.

31
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,510
安德鲁还是个孩子
Andrew's still a child.

32
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,010
他16岁了  这也不奇怪
He's 16. It's not unheard of.

33
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,450
-亲爱的  你得跟他谈谈  -跟他说什么
- Honey, you have to talk to him. - And tell him what?

34
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,630
告诉他我们发现了他的避孕套
Tell him that we found his condom and that

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,750
告诉他不许  那啥
he is forbidden from... You know.

36
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,000
我可以跟他讲我们觉得他还太年轻
I can absolutely tell him that we think he's too young,

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,730
但这可没什么用
but I don't think it's gonna do any good.

38
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,040
至少我们可以去搜他的屋子
Well, then, the least we can do is to search his room,

39
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,960
如果发现了更多的这个  我们就没收
and if we find any more of these, we'll confiscate them.

40
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,740
那能有什么用呢
That will accomplish what?

41
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,660
如果我们没收了他的避孕套  也许
If we take away his condoms maybe...

42
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:47,640
他是个十多岁的男孩子
He's a teenage boy.

43
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,060
就算我们把他的小弟弟也没收了
We could take away his penis,

44
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,570
他还是会想要做爱
he'd still try to have sex.

45
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,040
我们不能把这放回他房间
Well, we can't put it back in his room.

46
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:57,440
那样就好像我们在纵容他进行婚前性行为
That would be like we're condoning pre-marital sex.

47
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,550
布里  我换个方式说
Bree, let me put this another way.

48
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,680
你想不想当奶奶
Do you want to become a grandmother?

49
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,420
没错  布里信从传统的价值观
Yes, Bree believed in old-fashioned values.

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,860
但她也相信
But she also believed

51
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:23,840
做好预防措施比悔恨更重要
it was better to be safe than sorry.

52
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,710

《绝望的主妇》第一季 第十五集
Desperate Housewives S01E15

56
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,080
郊区的每一个早晨都会迎来
Each new morning in suburbia brings with it

57
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,750
一些新的谎言
a new set of lies.

58
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,980
善意的小谎言  大家认为无伤大雅
Little white lies, told not to hurt...

59
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,420
早啊  派卓夫人  你今天气色真好
Morning, Mrs. Petchul, you look lovely today.

60
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:23,020
而且能让生活更愉快
...But to make life more pleasant.

61
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,770
人们说这种谎来保护自己
They tell these lies to protect themselves

62
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,930
和他们的名声
and their reputations.

63
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,970
我的天  太让人郁闷了
Oh, for god's sake, this is unbelievable.

64
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,560
我下次坚决不用网上银行了
This is the last time I do my banking online.

65
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,240
当然  有时候
Of course, every now and then,

66
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,580
总有一些人
the day arrives when someone

67
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,290
最终决定要说实话
finally decides to tell the truth.

68
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,150
他被枪击了  你怎么没跟我们说呢
He was shot? How could you not tell us about this?

69
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,460
他挺尴尬的  说这是个意外事故
He was embarrassed. He said it was an accident.

70
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,550
别这么看着我  有时候是会发生意外
Oh, don't look at me like that. Accidents happen.

71
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,560
我们知道你想要信任麦克
We know you want to trust Mike,

72
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,690
但他的车库里有一个死去女人的首饰
But he had a dead woman's jewelry in his garage.

73
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,290
有吗  我们也不能确定啊
Now did he? We don't know that for sure.

74
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,540
我们所知道的只是
All we know is

75
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,400
勒奈特的孩子拿着这玩意出现
that Lynette's kids turned up with it.

76
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,910
也就是说  你觉得是双胞胎杀了玛莎
So what are you saying, that the twins murdered Martha?

77
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,740
我不会排除他们的嫌疑
Well, I wouldn't put it past them.

78
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,680
我是说这跟麦克作案的可能性是一样的
I'm saying that is about as likely as Mike having done it.

79
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,590
他是个好人  我了解他
He's a good guy. I know him.

80
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,880
他  他可是麦克
I mean, he's... He's mike.

81
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:22,150
我也不觉得是麦克做的
Honestly, I don't think Mike did it either,

82
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,720
但如果我们不报警  就是藏匿证物罪了
But if we don't call, we're guilty of withholding evidence.

83
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:28,000
说的没错  如果他是无辜的
Well, you know what? If he is innocent, this should

84
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,290
那要澄清不是很容易吗
be a simple matter to clear up.

85
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,360
但是  你想怎么做  我们就怎么做
But... we will do whatever you want us to do.

86
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,340
好吧  报警
Ok, call.

87
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,990
我是不是该直接拨911
Shall I just dial 911?

88
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,880
这又不是紧急事故
It's not really an emergency.

89
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:46,790
可这是谋杀
There was a murder.

90
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,410
那也不是最近的事了  我可不想妨碍公务
Well, not recently. And I prefer not to tie up the line.

91
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,380
你就打吧
Will you just call?

92
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,950
我妈一会就回来
My mom will be home any minute.

93
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,600
她如果看见你会生气的
She'll freak if she sees you here.

94
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,140
我就是想亲自把这个送过来
Oh, I just wanted to deliver this personally.

95
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,430
我要办一个聚会
I'm having a party.

96
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,300
你知道她不喜欢我们俩见面
You know she doesn't want us to see each other.

97
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,670
你一定得来  我  我是为了你才办的
Well, you gotta come. I... You're the reason I'm doing this.

98
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,660
我会跟我妈说说看  好吧
I'll try to talk to my mom, ok?

99
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,080
但是你真的得走了
But you really gotta go.

100
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:34,020
-索利斯太太  -抱歉  我认识你吗
- Hey, Mrs. Solis. - I'm sorry. Do I know you?

101
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,560
我是贾斯汀  约翰的室友
Yeah, I'm Justin, John's roommate.

102
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,720
我等了你好长时间了
I've been waiting forever for you to show up.

103
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,930
-是吗  为什么  -我想帮你个忙
- Really? Why? - I want to do you a favor.

104
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,160
帮什么忙
What kind of favor?

105
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,070
约翰说你现在请不起园丁了
John says that you can't exactly afford a gardener right now,

106
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,740
我跟他说我愿意做  不要工钱
and I told him I'd be happy to do it. For free.

107
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,780
你想免费帮我修整草坪
You want to mow my lawn for free?

108
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,180
修整草坪  帮你浇花  修剪灌木
Mow your lawn. Water your flowers. Trim your bushes.

109
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,280
约翰为你做过的事  我都能做
I could do everything John did for you.

110
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,820
你真是善良  不过我看不用了
That's very generous of you, but I don't think so.

111
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,190
为什么
Why?

112
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,490
因为我老公最近一直在家
Because my husband is home quite a lot these days.

113
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,330
如果需要修剪灌木  他可以搞定
If any bush needs trimming, he takes care of it.

114
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,830
这院子真美
This is a beautiful yard.

115
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,100
我肯定它需要格外的关照
I'm sure it could use a little extra attention.

116
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,940
真是受宠若惊  不过不用  谢谢
I'm flattered, but no, thank you.

117
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,440
索利斯太太  求你了
Mrs. Solis, please.

118
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,280
我有没有说过我老公一直在家的原因
Did I mention why my husband's home a lot?

119
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,140
他是被软禁了
He's under house arrest.

120
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,520
他现在对政府非常愤怒
He has a lot of anger toward the government right now,

121
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:42,860
急需找个人来发泄发泄
and he's just dying to find someone to take it out on.

122
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,070
同志们  这可不是曲棍球场
Hey, guys. This isn't a hockey rink.

123
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,100
你们能出去玩吗
Can you take it outside?

124
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,270
亲爱的  今天怎么样
Hi, honey. How was your day?

125
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,540
我没当成副总裁
I didn't get the V.P. gig.

126
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,180
汤姆  太遗憾了
Oh, Tom, I am so sorry.

127
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,900
我真的想不通
It doesn't make sense to me.

128
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,520
彼得森有事都是来找我的
I'm Peterson's "go-to guy".

129
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,960
蒂姆·杜根在公司就会吹牛
So how does Tim Duggan, the biggest blowhard in the office,

130
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,400
还当上了副总裁  凭什么不是我
get promoted to vice president over me?

131
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,060
我以为你喜欢蒂姆·杜根
I thought you liked Tim Duggan?

132
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,260
我是喜欢  只是  我也不知道
I do. I just... I don't know, I just,

133
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,040
我只是很想升职
I really wanted that promotion.

134
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,640
儿子们  你们能不能到外边去打你们的比赛
Hey, boys, can you please take the Stanley Cup finals outside.

135
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,580
你有没有告诉彼得森你很想要这份工作
Did you tell Mr. Peterson that you wanted the job?

136
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,880
我在那工作了8年半
I have worked at that firm for 8 1/2 years.

137
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,480
杜根还不到两年  我才不会去求他
Duggan's been there for less than two. I am not gonna beg.

138
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,330
我没说去求他
I'm not saying to beg.

139
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,290
你有时候得自己站出来
You just have to step up from time to time.

140
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,740
你得看到机会  抓住机会
You have to see your opportunity and take it.

141
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,260
没人会同情弱者
Nobody respects a shrinking violet.

142
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,290
又不是只能有一种领导风格
There is more than one, you know,  leadership style.

143
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,560
我是低调点  但是很有效率
Mine is quiet but... Effective.

144
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:56,500
带上你们的球棍出去
Take that racket outside!

145
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,770
你自己喜欢就行了
Whatever works for you.

146
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,210
苏珊
Susan!

147
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,080
美女  去哪了
Hey, sexy. Where you been?

148
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,270
我给你打了两次电话  你在躲我吗
I called you twice. You avoiding me?

149
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:14,120
我怎么会躲你呢
Don't be silly. Why would I do that?

150
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,450
我就是忙着买杂货而已
No, I've been really busy grocery shopping.

151
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,430
买了两天  你这是在囤货啊
For two days? You must be pretty well stocked.

152
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:28,000
晚上一块吃晚饭吧
How about dinner tonight?

153
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,700
晚饭  今天
Dinner... Tonight? Um...

154
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,300
你没事吧
You ok?

155
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,210
你能帮我拿一下吗
Can you hold these a sec?

156
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,270
趴在车上
Up against the car!

157
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,780
你有权保持沉默
You have the right to remain silent.

158
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,850
你所说的一切都可能
Anything you do say can be used

159
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,760
作为呈堂证供
against you in a court of law.

160
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:55,890
你有权利雇佣律师
You have the right to consult an attorney...

161
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:00,960
跟你们说
So get this.

162
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,660
扎克·杨周六晚上要举行泳装派对
Zach Young's throwing a pool party saturday night.

163
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:08,040
发了一堆正式请柬  用的还是花体字
He sent out a bunch formal invitations.Complete with fancy lettering.

164
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:11,740
我倒是奇怪他干嘛不洒点须后水上去
I'm surprised he didn't spritz them with aftershave.

165
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,430
请柬做的漂亮不对吗
What is wrong with nice invitations?

166
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,110
妈妈  是泳装派对
Mom, it's a pool party.

167
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,380
他直接在院子里发几张传单就好了
Why couldn't he have just passed out flyers in the quad.

168
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:21,480
因为他天生就当不了正常人
'Cause he's genetically incapable of being cool.

169
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,990
那你们去吗
So, uh... Are you going?

170
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:24,620
可能吧  
Uh... Maybe.

171
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,300
莉莎和贾斯汀  还有其他几个朋友
I mean, um, Lisa and Justin and some of the guys

172
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,990
觉得游游泳也挺有意思的
thought it'd be fun to swim.

173
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,760
如果真的很无聊的话我们溜掉就是了
We can always bail if it's lame as we think it's going to be..

174
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,060
莉莎是你那个穿了脐环的朋友
Oh, is, um, Lisa your friend with the pierced navel?

175
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,600
是啊
Yeah.

176
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:41,900
你们最近老在一块玩是吗
You've been spending a lot of time together lately. Haven't you?

177
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,840
差不多吧
I guess.

178
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:50,150
安德鲁  我希望你周六晚上11点前回家
Oh, uh, Andrew, I'm gonna want you home by 11 on saturday.

179
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,450
11点  周日又不上学
11? Mom, it's not even a school night!

180
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,510
宵禁是没有用的
Bree, a curfew isn't gonna do any good.

181
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,280
你可能愿意放弃
You may be able to abdicate

182
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,050
作为家长的职责
all your parental responsibility,

183
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,690
我可不会
But I cannot.

184
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,500
到底是怎么回事
What... What's going on here?

185
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,540
这是不是跟你放在我房间那个安全套有关
Was this have to do with the condom you left in my room?

186
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,840
事实上  没错  我们得明确一件事
As a matter of fact, it does. And just so we're clear,

187
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,670
如果你让莉莎怀孕了  你就得娶她
if you get Lisa pregnant, you will marry her.

188
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,240
安德鲁  这一点也不搞笑
Andrew, this is not funny.

189
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,150
妈妈  相信我  这很搞笑
Mom, trust me. This is very funny.

190
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,590
主要是因为这个安全套不是我的
Mostly because the condom wasn't mine.

191
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,130
你是个混蛋  知道吗
You suck, you know that?

192
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,470
很明显我们需要谈谈
So obviously we need to talk.

193
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,810
我还是处女  如果你想知道的话
I'm still a virgin, if that's what you want to know.

194
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,070
不错  
Well, good.

195
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:01,450
但你为什么会需要安全套呢
But why on earth would you need a condom?

196
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,220
因为我准备做爱  而且不想怀孕
Because I'm planning on having sex and not want to get pregnant.

197
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,820
丹妮尔  你是禁欲俱乐部的主席
Danielle, you are president of the abstinence club.

198
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,660
我下学期打算卸任了
I wasn't planning on running for a second term.

199
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,290
你打算和谁做爱呢
Who were you planning on having sex with?

200
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,010
约翰  
John.

201
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,340
约翰·罗兰  我还以为你把他甩了
John Rowland. I thought you broke up with him.

202
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,000
没有  是他把我甩了  
No. He broke up with me.

203
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,460
你知道为什么吗  因为我不想做爱
You want to know why, because I wouldn't do it.

204
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,870
要是他是这种男孩  分了更好
If that's the type of boy he is, then good riddance.

205
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,780
妈  学校里的男孩子都是这种人
Mom, every boy at my school is that type of boy.

206
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,840
而且  约翰不一样
And besides, it's different with John.

207
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,510
我爱他
I love him.

208
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:36,180
宝贝  靠性来取悦男孩
Sweetheart, just because you give a boy sex

209
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,520
不一定能得到对方的爱
doesn't mean you'll get love in return.

210
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,240
也许我就是犯傻
So maybe I'm being stupid.

211
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,460
那又怎么样呢  只不过是上床而已
What's the big deal? It's just sex.

212
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,260
我在乎你的幸福
I am looking over for your happiness.

213
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:51,000
我能理解年轻时的那种冲动
I understand what it's like to be young and feel urges.

214
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,400
不过我一直等到结婚  你爸爸也是
But I waited until I got married. As did your father.

215
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,910
那样好得多
And it was so much better.

216
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,280
但是爸爸最终背叛了你
But daddy ended up cheating on you.

217
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,040
是  那个
Yes. Well...

218
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,380
现在他搬回来了  你就更痛苦了
And ever since he moved back, you've been miserable.

219
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,720
你为什么这么说  
Why would you say that?

220
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,450
我们卧室间的墙壁像纸一样薄
The walls between our bedrooms are paper thin.

221
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,390
我听到了很多我不该听的
I hear more stuff than I probably should.

222
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,620
妈妈  我很爱你
Look, mom, I love you a lot,

223
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:16,100
但是你真的是最没资格 
But you really are the last person ever

224
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,190
给别人关于性与幸福的建议的人了
to give anyone advice about sex and happiness.

225
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,700
看到这些了吗  又有五份欠费通知了
Have you seen these? Five more past due notices.

226
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,560
别担心  我正在想办法  
Don't worry, I'm handling it.

227
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,440
你有什么办法
How are you handling it?

228
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,340
能不能让我先把三明治吃完
Can I please finish my sandwich?

229
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,810
看到我们的银行账户了吗  我们破产了
Have you seen our account? We're broke.

230
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,200
还有按揭要付 
We have the mortgage payment coming up...

231
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,630
还有不动产税要交  还有 
we have property taxes, we have...

232
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,320
加布  会好起来的
Gaby, it's gonna be ok.

233
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,410
不会  我们真的完蛋了
No, it's not. We are seriously screwed.

234
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,360
而且我很担心你一点都不上心
And I am freaking out that you're not freaking out.

235
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,520
-会好起来的  -什么时候
- Look, things will turn around. - When?

236
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,990
我也不知道  
I don't know when.

237
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,500
不过我们是幸运儿  好运会再来
But we're lucky people. And we'll be lucky again.

238
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,870
-那是什么  -割草机
- What is that? - It's the lawn mower.

239
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,870
今天我们有了个新园丁
We got a new gardener today.

240
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,040
不用花一分钱  这孩子是约翰的一个朋友
It won't cost us a cent. The kid's a friend of John's.

241
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:09,340
-卡洛斯  -他说他可以给免费修整草坪
- Carlos... - And he said he'd do the lawn for free.

242
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:15,120
难以置信吧  我们是幸运儿
Can you believe it? We are lucky people.

243
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:32,470
同志们  很高兴又见到你们
Hey, guys, good to see you again.

244
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,140
别那么郁闷  你能得分的
Don't look so glum. You'll get a hit.

245
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,270
不是因为这个  
Oh, it's not that.

246
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,980
这个是我"讨厌蒂姆·杜根"的表情
This is my "hating Tim Duggan" look.

247
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,310
杜根又得分了
Oh, Duggan connects.

248
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,850
瞧
There!

249
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,950
瞧这磨洋工的混蛋跑起来那样儿
Look at that job-stealing bastard run.

250
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,030
杜根总是热衷于邀功希宠
Duggan is really showing some of that glory-hounding,

251
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:57,000
溜须拍马他最擅长不过了
Ass-kissing hustle that he is so well-known for.

252
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,930
我都忘了你在不爽的时候是多么可爱了
I forgot how much fun you are when you're bitter.

253
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:02,060
他在跑更多的垒
Look, he's stretching for extra bases.

254
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,470
就像他将魔手伸向更多的领域
Just like he stretched for extra territory,

255
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,130
欺负被埋没的全能选手汤姆·斯加沃
screwing over unsung utility player, Tom Scavo.

256
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,730
杜根摔倒了  
Oh! Down goes Duggan.

257
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,580
杜根摔倒了  很疼吧
Duggan goes down. That's gotta hurt.

258
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:16,030
马屁精触杀出局  
Oh, Lord! Hound is tagged out, and now he's gonna

259
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:18,680
看来蒂姆·杜根这一跤摔得不轻
have to deal with some tough dirt stains, that Tim Duggan.

260
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,810
汤姆
Tom...

261
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,080
不  我相信他只是装模作样
No, I'm sure he's just grandstanding.

262
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,660
天哪
Oh, my god!

263
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,820
见鬼
Holy crap!

264
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,600
不过是个游泳池派对而已  大家都会去
It's only a pool party. Everyone is going to be there.

265
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,170
我说不行
I said no.

266
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,140
你想怎么样  
What are you goning to do?

267
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,610
难道要让我18岁之前不接触任何男孩
Keep a boy-free zone around me until I'm 18?

268
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:47,150
一两年内你可以接触男孩  但不要是他
You can see boys, in a couple years, just not that boy.

269
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,310
你为什么讨厌扎克
Why do you hate Zach?

270
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,940
我不是讨厌扎克  就是觉得他有点疯
I don't hate Zach. I just think he's sort of crazy.

271
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,180
人们也说你"有点疯"
Mom, I've heard people call you "sort of crazy".

272
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:58,420
我是可爱的疯  他是狂暴的疯
Well, I'm adorable crazy. And he's rampage crazy.

273
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,160
-苏珊·梅尔  -什么事
- Susan Mayer? - Yeah?

274
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,800
我是柯普兰警探
I'm detective Copeland,

275
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,530
正在调查玛莎·胡博被杀的案子
investigating the murder of Martha Huber.

276
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,970
我想和你谈谈麦克·德尔非诺的事
I need to talk to you about Mike Delfino.

277
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,410
你记不记得上个月7号见过德尔非诺先生
Do you remember seeing Mr. Delfino on the 7th of last month?

278
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,840
7号很重要吗
Is the 7th important?

279
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,640
我们认为玛莎·胡博是那天晚上被杀的
We believe it was the night that Martha Huber was murdered.

280
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:23,080
她最后一次露面是那晚9点钟  在杂货店
She was last seen at the grocery store at nine.

281
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,740
她本来第二天约了牙医  但没有去
She didn't show for a dentist appointment the next morning.

282
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,880
-那天星期几  -星期天
- What day was that? - It was a sunday.

283
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,520
天哪  正是那天
Oh! Oh, my god! Yes!

284
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,890
是呀  是呀
Yes! yes!

285
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:35,050
是   那天晚上我和麦克在一起
Yes, I... I was with Mike that night.

286
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,600
-你确定吗  -是的  我确信
- You're sure? - Yes. I was.

287
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,490
那是个大日子  确定关系的日子
It was a big night, first relationship-wise.

288
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:41,860
那是我们第一次
It was the first time that we...

289
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,140
-你们第一次什么  -上床
- The first time you...? - Did it.

290
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,900
他们第一次上床
The first time they did it.

291
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,560
-朱莉  -是的
- Julie! - It was.

292
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,940
-你怎么知道的  -我又不傻
- How did you know? - I'm not clueless.

293
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,910
我在洗衣篮里发现了男式底裤
I found men's boxers in the clothes hamper.

294
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,780
别把这写下来
Don't write that down.

295
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,040
很好  你可以放麦克走了  他是无辜的
This is good. You can let Mike go. He is innocent.

296
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,590
假设你说的都是真的
Assuming everything you're telling me is true.

297
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:01,810
是真的
It's true.

298
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:06,190
第二天早上她还做了小小的心形烤饼
The next morning she made pancakes in the shape of little hearts.

299
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,690
没开玩笑  小小的心形
Seriously, little hearts.

300
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,640
天哪
Oh, god!

301
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,210
贾斯汀  你在这儿干吗
Justin. What are you doing up here?

302
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,040
我弄完篱笆了 
Uh... I finished the hedges.

303
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,580
索利斯先生需不需要我干点别的
Is there anything else Mr. Solis wants done?

304
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,670
我不知道  他不在家  去见律师了
I don't know. He's not here. He had a meeting with his lawyer.

305
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,150
那么这儿就只有我们两个了
So I guess that means we're all alone.

306
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,690
不  就我一个  你该走了
No. That means I'm all alone. You're leaving.

307
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,810
我不着急走
I'm not in a hurry.

308
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:38,190
我们可以一起待一会儿  
Come on, we could hang out for a while.

309
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,450
我不这么想
I don't think so.

310
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,760
别这样  如果你了解我
Come on. If you just got to know me,

311
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,660
你会知道我多有趣
you'd see I can be lots of fun.

312
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,100
我的朋友都这么说
All my friends say so.

313
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,470
我没兴趣和你交朋友  
I'm not interested in becoming one of your friends.

314
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,730
滚出我的卧室
Get out of my bedroom.

315
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,930
别这样  索利斯太太  对我好点
Come on, mrs. Solis. Be nice.

316
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,380
这么做可不对
You shouldn't have done that.

317
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,680
你知不知道
Do you know how easy it would be

318
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,580
要告诉我丈夫你图谋不轨是多么容易
for me to tell my husband what you tried to do?

319
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:09,020
告诉他你和约翰的事儿对我来说更容易
Not as easy as it'd be for me to tell him about you and John.

320
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,290
很抱歉  索利斯太太
I... I'm sorry, Mrs. Solis,

321
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,330
不过你得对我客气点
but you're gonna have to be nice to me,

322
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:18,130
至少一回
at least once.

323
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,010
麦克
Mike!

324
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,310
麦克  你还好吧
Mike! Are you ok?

325
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,620
是  是  有点儿尴尬
Uh... Yeah. Yeah. I'm a little bit embarrassed.

326
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:43,350
一定成了邻居们的话题
Must be the talk of the neighborhood.

327
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,780
没有  没有的事
No. Not really. No.

328
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,730
你猜怎么样  我提供了你的不在场证明
So guess what? I'm your alibi.

329
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,250
我跟警方说 
I told the police

330
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,630
胡博夫人被杀的那晚我们在一起
that we were together the night Mrs. Huber was killed.

331
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:56,290
而且那是难忘的一晚
And that I could never forget that night.

332
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:59,130
你相信我没有杀胡博夫人 
You don't think I killed Mrs. Huber?

333
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,740
信  我当然信
No! No, of course not.

334
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,390
我相信你不会杀任何人
I could never think you killed anybody,

335
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:06,010
即使我没有你的不在场证明  何况我有
even if I wasn't your alibi, which I am.

336
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:09,500
好  我要去洗个澡  
Ok. I'm, um, I'm gonna go take a shower.

337
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,010
监狱环境比较恶劣
Jail's kinda gross.

338
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,200
回头给你电话  好吗  
I'll call you later. Ok?

339
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,490
好  什么时候
Sure. When?

340
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,990
稍后吧  我还有些事要处理  好吗
Later. I just got some stuff I gotta take care of. Ok?

341
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,890
好
Ok.

342
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,030
-范德坎普太太  -你好  约翰
- Mrs. Van de kamp. - Hello, John.

343
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:33,500
不好意思  我不请自来  你有时间吗
I'm sorry to drop by unannounced. Do you have a moment?

344
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,700
当然
Sure.

345
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,410
那么  您来有什么事吗
So... What can I do for you?

346
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,210
是这样  我女儿打算把初夜献给你
Well, I tell you, my daughter is planning on giving you her virginity

347
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,810
如果你肯拒绝她的话  我感激不尽
and I would consider it a personal favor if you wouldn't take it.

348
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:57,060
蒂姆情况怎么样
So what's the word on Tim?

349
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,530
他的心脏搭桥手术很成功
He came through the triple bypass with flying colors.

350
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,730
感谢上帝
Thank god.

351
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:04,630
没有那么顺利
It's not all coming up roses.

352
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,840
他得有四个半月
He's not gonna be able to come back

353
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,940
不能回来工作了
to work for four-and-a-half months.

354
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,600
想说什么
What?

355
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,740
公司业务还在扩大
Company still needs to expand,

356
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,340
我想他们需要个健康的敏锐的家伙
I figure that they need a fit, heart-smart guy

357
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,750
像我这样的  走出来收拾局面
like me to step up, take the ball.

358
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:23,020
你在指望升到他的位置吗  
You're going after his promotion?

359
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,450
不  我已经得到了  
No. I already got it.

360
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,020
你真该见识一下当时的我
You should have seen me.

361
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,650
我径直走进彼得森的办公室
I walked straight into Peterson's office

362
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,130
跟他说  如果他还是要升杜根的话就太蠢了
and told him he would be a fool to hold Duggan's promotion.

363
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:35,430
-你说你的老板蠢  -是的
- You called your boss a fool? - I did.

364
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,120
现在想起来真险  
That was risky in retrospect.

365
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,230
不过他仍然给了我这职位
But still he gave me the job.

366
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:42,040
-天啊  太棒了  -亲爱的  是我
- Oh, my god. That's great. - Honey, it's me.

367
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,950
我得到了整个西海岸  
I got the whole west coast.

368
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:46,100
我  什么  什么西海岸
Oh, my... What? What the whole west coast?

369
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,580
我以为你得到是一个内部的职位
I thought you were going after an in-house position.

370
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,700
不是  我将要建立一个新的分公司来负责
No. I'm setting up new offices from

371
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,520
西雅图到洛杉矶地区  我告诉过你的
Seattle to LA. I told you that.

372
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,950
不
No.

373
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,750
不  你没说过
No, you didn't.

374
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:03,160
好吧  这会导致出差多那么一点  但是
Ok. Well, so it's gonna be a little bit more travel, but...

375
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:03,260
多一点
More travel?

376
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:06,260
汤姆  你已经有一半的时间都不在家了
Tom, you're barely here half the time as it is.

377
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,330
现在你还要  什么  双倍工作量吗
Now you're gonna have, what, twice the workload?

378
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,630
亲爱的  别妨碍这事
Honey, please don't ruin this.

379
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,830
你应该跟我商量一下
You should have consulted with me.

380
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:17,000
我说过  你让我别再像个畏缩不前的胆小鬼
I did! You told me to stop being a shrinking violet.

381
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:20,740
我以为那就是个内部职位
I thought this was an in-house position.

382
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,210
好吧  我要去洗澡了
Ok, I'm gonna go shower.

383
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,310
等一下  我知道这对你意味着什么
Look, wait. Wait. I know what this means to you.

384
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:28,570
不  你不知道  你不明白  
No, you don't. No, you don't.

385
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,580
我已经41岁了
I am 41 years old.

386
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:32,270
如果我现在还不能做到副总裁的话  
If I don't make vice president now,

387
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,490
那就再也没机会了
it's never gonna happen.

388
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,290
这是我的事业  它对我很重要
This is my career. It's important to me.

389
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:40,370
我也是啊  但我辞职了  我就没牺牲吗
So was mine. But I'm here, aren't I?

390
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,700
我还是要接受这个职位
I'm gonna take the job.

391
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,480
她说你跟她分手
She said you broke up with her

392
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,520
是因为她拒绝跟你做爱
because she refused to have sex.

393
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:00,710
好吧  事情是这样的
Wow! um... Ok, here's the deal.

394
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,920
我说过  但这只是个借口
I said that. But it was just an excuse.

395
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:07,450
我是说  事实是  我不是那么喜欢她
I mean, the truth is, I wasn't that into her.

396
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,590
真的
Really?

397
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,390
而她总是很骄傲自己是处女
She was always so proud of never having done it,

398
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,530
我发现  我可以拿这个做借口
I figured, "hey, this is my way out."

399
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,540
她对你是如此的用情
Well, she feels very passionately about you.

400
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,470
别会错意  她很好
Don't get me wrong. She's nice.

401
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:25,070
但事实上  我心里有别人
But the truth is, there's someone else.

402
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:28,840
你们关系确定了吗
Oh, are you going steady?

403
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:33,550
不算是  我们过去常见面
Not exactly. We were seeing each other pretty regularly,

404
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:37,890
但那位女士  女孩  把我甩了
but this other lady... Girl, she sort of dumped me.

405
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,120
我明白了
Oh, I see.

406
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,860
我会跟丹妮尔谈谈
Look, I'll talk to Danielle

407
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:47,690
别担心  我会温柔地跟她做个了断
and don't worry, I'll let her down gently.

408
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:50,570
其实  我并不希望你那么温柔
Um, actually, I would prefer if you didn't.

409
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:58,040
我了解我的女儿  她很执着
I know my daughter. She's very determined.

410
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,400
除非你真的对她很决绝
Unless you're really firm with her,

411
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,100
不然她还会抱有幻想的
she'll think there's hope.

412
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,340
好吧  我会很坚决的
Ok. I'll be firm.

413
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:09,350
最好是残酷一些
Better still, be brutal.

414
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,390
决定沉迷于口舌之快是吗
Decided to indulge your sweet tooth?

415
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:28,330
我一年之内就会死
I'll be dead inside a year.

416
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,070
我有比腰围更值得担心的事情
I've got bigger things to worry about than my waistline.

417
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,610
他们觉得你杀掉的那个女人是谁
So, who's the woman they think you killed?

418
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,870
玛莎·胡博  好事的老女人
Martha Huber. Local busybody.

419
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:39,240
我觉得她不是被蓄意谋杀的
I thought her murder was random.

420
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:43,350
她的首饰出现在你的车库里  这算不算蓄意
Nothing random about her jewelry ending up in your garage.

421
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,290
是你杀了她吗
Did you kill her?

422
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,430
不  有人陷害我
No. Whoever set me up did a good job.

423
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:50,020
现在警察一直在监视我
The cops are all over me.

424
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,130
你距离真相已经很近了
You're getting close to something.

425
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,930
如果真的很近了  我怎么没看到
If I am close, I don't see it.

426
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,730
人们总会留下线索
People leave trails.

427
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:59,270
总有一条  将会指向黛德丽
One of those trails will lead to Deidre.

428
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,430
不管是谁陷害了你  他就是知情者
Whoever set you up must know that.

429
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:05,210
也许是吧  但我要是被关起来就不好办了
Maybe, but I won't be much good to you locked up.

430
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,370
我很有钱  麦克  有钱的好处之一就是
I'm rich, Mike. One of the best things about being rich

431
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:13,440
确保你不论遇到任何问题  都能全身而退
is the security of knowing you can buy your way out of any problem.

432
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,960
我不会把钱带到我的坟墓里去的
I'm not taking my money to the grave.

433
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,120
我会用它来保你周全的
I'm gonna use it to save your ass.

434
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,660
-索利斯夫人  -你好  贾斯汀
- Mrs. Solis? - Hello, Justin.

435
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,240
你在这里干什么
What are you doing here?

436
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,870
我来跟你的室友谈谈
I am here to talk to your roommate.

437
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:36,710
约翰  我以为你们都不说话了
John? I didn't think you guys talked any more.

438
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:40,080
现在我们有事可谈了  比如说你
Well, now we have something to talk about. You.

439
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,650
-我  -是的
- Me? - Yes.

440
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,080
你居然试图敲诈我让我跟你上床
How you're trying to blackmail me into sleeping with you.

441
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,650
-我想知道他会做何反应  -索利斯夫人
- I wonder how he'll react. - Mrs. Solis...

442
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,280
你觉得他会动粗吗
You think he'll get violent?

443
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:55,190
-你不能告诉约翰这些  -我可以
- You can't talk to John about that. - Oh, I can.

444
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,660
而我也就这么做  你这个人渣
And I will, you little worthless piece of crap.

445
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,330
听我说  索利斯夫人  我很抱歉
Listen, Mrs. Solis, I'm sorry.

446
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,280
我本来不想敲诈你的  
I didn't want to blackmail you.

447
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,760
那你为什么还这么做
Then why did you?

448
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:10,570
我真的需要跟你上床
I really needed to sleep with you.

449
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,470
-为什么  -因为
- Why? - Because...

450
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,310
我觉得我可能是个同性恋
I think I might be gay.

451
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,810
爸爸  爸爸  爸爸
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

452
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,090
怎么了
What's up?

453
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:33,430
儿子们知道你回家会很晚很晚
The boys knew you wouldn't be home till after, um, bedtime,

454
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:38,560
所以我们决定要突袭看望下我们的新副总裁
and so we decided to pop in and visit the new V.P.

455
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,970
我终于有了间带窗户的办公室了
Check it out. I finally got an office with a window. Huh?

456
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,310
是啊  这都是为了窗户
Yeah. It's all about the window.

457
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:49,270
伙计们  谁想来骑椅子
Hey, guys. Hey, who wants chair rides?

458
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:53,010
-我  我  我  -这条路  我们来喽
- Me! Me! Me! - Out this way. Here we go.

459
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:55,820
要开始了  小伙子们  准备好了吗
Here we go, guys. Ready?

460
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,290
坐稳了
Hold on.

461
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,560
视察新的办公室来了
Checking out the new executive digs?

462
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,460
你知道的
Oh, you know it.

463
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:14,030
-我能告诉你个小秘密吗  -好啊
- Can I tell you a little secret? - Sure.

464
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:17,670
丹本来想晋升蒂姆·杜根
Dan wanted to hold the promotion over for Tim Duggan.

465
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:21,540
是我劝他把这个职位给汤姆的
And I'm the one that convinced him to give it To tom.

466
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,910
-是吗  -没错
- Really? - Uh-huh.

467
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,390
汤姆简直就是个工作狂
Tom is such a workhorse

468
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:28,920
而且他又是那么想得到这个职位
and he wanted it so badly.

469
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:32,480
是啊  他就是那样的
Yeah, he certainly did.

470
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:37,450
怎么了  难道你对他的晋升不开心吗
What is wrong? Aren't you happy about this promotion?

471
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:42,900
勒奈特认为最好是跟老板的老婆撒个谎
Lynette realized it was best to lie to the boss's wife...

472
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:45,530
当然这很好
Well, it's great.

473
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,270
很明显  谢谢
Obviously. Thank you.

474
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,370
倘若她的话不是那么令人信服
...Provided she wasn't too convincing.

475
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,170
当然  我的意思是
Of course, I mean,

476
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:59,310
我会  一直想着他
I will... miss him being gone all the time.

477
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,490
他会挣回更多的钱
He'll be bringing in more money,

478
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:03,790
但他会错过孩子们的生日
but he is gonna miss the birthdays,

479
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,070
篮球比赛  第一次的蹒跚学步
baseball games, first steps.

480
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:10,660
但有得必有失嘛  对吧
But that's the trade-off. Right?

481
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:14,310
我只是希望汤姆有朝一日回想过去
I just hope one day Tom doesn't look back

482
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,760
不会后悔错过那么多美好时光
and regret being gone so much.

483
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:22,440
我最好在他们打碎东西之前出去看看
Oh, I better get out there before they break something.

484
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,030
-好的  一会见  -好
- Of course. I will see you soon. - Ok.

485
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,920
你在这种感觉的驱使下做出过什么吗
So, have you been acting on these feelings?

486
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,910
我有个哥们  我们常在一起
I got a buddy. We get together.

487
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,160
胡搞瞎闹的  不过没什么大不了的
Mess around. But it's no big deal.

488
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:48,170
就是最近  我开始关心他  而且
It's just lately, I've been starting to care about him and...

489
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:50,500
我不知道该怎么办
and I don't know how to handle it.

490
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,570
我想如果你跟你这样的人上床了
And I thought if I sleep with somebody like you,

491
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:59,270
我就能有个确定的答案  不用再惊慌了
I'll know for sure and I can stop freaking out about this.

492
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,670
但为什么非得是我  你是个很帅的男孩
But why me? You're a good-looking kid.

493
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:04,080
为什么不跟你的同龄人试试呢
Why not test drive someone your own age?

494
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:08,770
女孩们很八卦  如果我开始跟什么人约会 
Girls talk. If I start something with somebody

495
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:10,850
结果最后  搞砸了
and it doesn't... work out,

496
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,980
学校里的每个人就都会发现的
Everyone at school will find out.

497
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,060
而且我觉得我可以信任你
And I figured I can trust you,

498
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,330
你已经有丈夫  有所有一切了
cause you have a husband and all.

499
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:22,630
从某种诡异的角度上  我能理解你了
Well, I guess that makes sense in a weird sort of way.

500
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,460
你看  我哥们儿和我
You know, my buddy and I have been

501
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,930
在一起有些日子了
messing around for quite a while,

502
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,980
我一直告诉我自己
and this whole time I kept telling myself

503
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,740
这根本不代表什么  你明白吗
that it didn't really mean anything, you know?

504
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,950
我在骗自己  是吧
Guess I've been kidding myself, huh?

505
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,250
我们都不愿意承认一些事情
We're all in denial about something.

506
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:50,180
但是你最后还是要面对现实
But you're finally facing the truth,

507
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,890
那才是勇敢者的做法
and I think that's sort of brave.

508
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,700
-谢谢  -我该走了
- Thanks. - I should probably go.

509
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,500
还是想让你知道
Uh... Just so you know,

510
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,140
我绝不会告诉索利斯先生你和约翰的事情
I never would have told Mr. Solis about you and John.

511
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:09,440
我可能是同性恋  但我不是个混蛋
I may be gay but I'm not a jerk.

512
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,460
你有什么感觉吗
Did you feel anything?

513
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,730
没什么感觉
Not really.

514
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:35,130
你肯定是同性恋
You're definitely gay.

515
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:49,960
不好意思这么晚打扰你
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you at night,

516
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:53,320
但我希望你能去警察局
but I was hoping that you could come to the station

517
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,390
再回答我们一些问题
to answer more questions.

518
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,320
现在吗  不好意思
Now? Well, I'm sorry,

519
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,360
我和我女儿今晚要去看电影
my daughter and I were gonna go see a movie tonight.

520
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:04,870
妈妈  我们可以改天去  没关系
Mom? We can do it another night. I'll be fine.

521
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,830
-等我拿下包  -没问题
- Uh, let me get my purse. - Great.

522
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,100
-你肯定吗  -是的
- Are you sure? - Yeah.

523
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,510
我不会很晚回来的
I won't be late.

524
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,670
-再见  -再见
- Bye. - Bye.

525
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,600
你说麦克7日晚10点
You said that Mike came to your house

526
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,460
去了你家
around 10 p.m. on the night of the seventh.

527
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:36,300
我是应该对着摄像机说还是
Um, am I supposed to talk into the camera or...

528
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,370
不用  对着我说就可以
No. Just talk to me.

529
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,600
好  没错  他来的时候大概是10点
Ok. Uh, yes. He came over around ten o'clock.

530
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,070
你知道麦克和玛莎·胡博之间

有什么过节吗
between Mike and Martha Huber?

532
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,710

533
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:52,310

从没见过枪因掉在地上而走火
I've never seen one discharge when it hits the ground.

539
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,170
必须有人扣动扳机
Someone has to pull the trigger.

540
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,970
那我就不知道了
I wouldn't know about that.

541
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,640
你知道有人在情人节的前一天 
Were you aware there was a home invasion

542
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,620
入侵了松树大道上的一户人家吗
on Pine Avenue the day before Valentine's?

什么
What?

549
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,450
这有什么必然联系
What does that have to do with...?

550
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:41,830
有时  恋爱中的人们会做傻事
Sometimes people do stupid things when they're in love.

551
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:46,200
我很清楚  我结过4次婚了
I should know. I've been married four times.

552
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:49,900
告诉我真相  他当晚没跟你在一起吧
Tell me the truth. He wasn't with you that night.

553
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,910
-他求你为他撒谎  -不  他没有
- He asked you to lie for him. - No, he didn't.

554
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,940
他真的跟我在一起  麦克不会杀任何人  
He was with me. And Mike wouldn't kill anybody.

555
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:56,970
这一点我很确定
I'm sure of that.

556
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:13,120

You want a coffe? I'm gonna go for a coffe.

560
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:48,330
她在包庇她的男人吗
Is she covering for her guy?

561
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,900
不  她是被骗了
No. She's just a sucker.

562
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:08,210
我想泳池里还没人呢  你去游吗
I guess no one's in the pool yet. Are you gonna swim?

563
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:12,690
拜托  我刚花了一小时吹头发
Please, I just spent an hour blowing out my hair.

564
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,820

是啊  他带了朋友来
Yeah, he brought his friends.

573

他们到处惹事  见怪不怪了
They're acting like total jerks. Alert the media.

574
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:46,550
我无所谓  现在你来了  一切都会好的
I don't care. You're here now. This is gonna be great.

希望你会游泳

- Can you possibly take it easy? - It's cool, man.

579

瞧  他漂起来了
Look, he floats.

580
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:07,700
放松点  这可是派对啊
All right? Relax. It's a party.

581
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,010
你最喜欢派对了  对吗
You're the main party animal, right?

582
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,710
我说得对吗
Am I right?

583
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:13,910
应该吧
I guess.

584
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:16,240
那好  那就要有喜欢的样子  
All right! Well, then act like it.

585
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,290
来  学个狼叫
Come on, give me a howl.

586
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:23,230
你可是主人  投入点  叫一声
Come on. You're the host. Revel in it. Gimme a howl.

587
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,500
这才像话
There you go.

588
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,410
你还好吗
You ok?

589
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:44,040
我干嘛听他的  他算什么东西
What do I care? He's nothing.

590
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,640
只要我想  我就能收拾得了他
I could take care of him if I wanted to.

591
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,090
你什么意思
How do you mean?

592
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,090
我知道我妈妈的枪藏在哪
I know where my mom kept her gun.

593
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,360
这可不好笑  扎克  
That's not funny, Zach.

594
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,230
如果你好好想想  这的确很好笑
If you think about it, yeah, it is.

595
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,510
朱莉
Julie!

596
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:22,150
丹妮尔  你还好吗
Hey! Danielle, are you ok?

597
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:25,820
我只是想回家  我们能走吗
I just want to go home. Can we go?

598
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:28,020
当然
Sure.

599
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:33,390
朱莉
Julie!

600
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,590
我要送丹妮尔回家
I'm taking Danielle home.

601
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,800
-你会回来吗  -我想不会
- Are you coming back? - I don't think so.

602
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:06,160
家长会开得怎样
So, how was the P.T.A. Meeting?

603
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,290
很久
Long.

604
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,670
彼得森今天叫我去他办公室了
So, Peterson called me into his office today.

605
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,940
真的
Really?

606
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,370
是啊  他改变了主意
Yeah. He, uh, he changed his mind.

607
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,900
他会替杜根保留那个职位
He's gonna hold that promotion for Duggan.

608
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:26,080
没关系
Yeah. It's, it's fine.

609
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,590
其实我挺开心的
I'm glad, really.

610
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:29,750
我也不想花那么多时间工作
I didn't want to work those long hours.

611
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,160
你知道我讨厌坐飞机
And you know how I hate flying.

612
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,760
我的背受不了
It does horrible things to my back.

613
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,750
鉴于这些外部压力
With all that extra stress,

614
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:41,460
十年后  我的下场就会像蒂姆·杜根一样
I would have ended up like Tim Duggan ten years from now. So...

615
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,630
是啊  当然
Yeah. Of course.

616
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:49,800
那么  都结束了
So it's... It's over.

617
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,270
有天你会当上副总裁的
You'll make V.P. One of these days.

618
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:56,040
没关系  真的
It's ok. Honest.

619
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:00,050
这样的结局  我也很满意
I am, uh... really glad that it worked out this way.

620
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,590
好吧
Ok.

621
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:26,540
天啊  你吓到我了
Oh, god. You scared me.

622
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:28,740
最近好吗
How'd it go?

623
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:31,510
过得挺好
It went just peachy.

624
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:35,390
又丢脸  又震惊
And humiliating and shocking.

625
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,250
-苏珊  -你怎么能这样
- Susan... - How could you?

626
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,140
天啊  "苏珊  你相信我吗"
God, "Susan, do you trust me?"

627
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,390
"我当然相信"
"Of course I do".

628
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:45,430
我真是个白痴  你真是个骗子
Oh, I'm such an idiot! And you're such a liar.

629
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,260
显然还是个凶手  毒贩
Oh, and apparently a killer and a drug dealer.

630
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:50,890
你的阅历不浅啊
That's quite a personal ad you've got going!

631
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,440
-我来紫藤郡  -别说了  麦克
- I came to Wisteria Lane... - Stop, Mike!

632
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,630
别说了
Just stop!

633
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,100
如果你说下去
If you keep talking,

634
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:03,200
你又会说开我的心门
you're gonna work your way into my heart,

635
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:09,020
而我不想再让你靠近我的心了
and I just don't want you anywhere near my heart.

636
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:10,780
永不
Ever.

637
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:18,960
朱莉
Julie?

638
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:23,930
妈妈需要一个拥抱
Mommy needs a hug.

639
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:26,430
朱莉
Julie?

640
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:48,950
朱莉在里面吗  朱莉·梅尔
Is Julie in there? Julie Mayer?

641
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,890
不知道  里面挺安静的
I don't know. It's pretty dead in there.

642
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,540
朱莉·亚历山德拉·梅尔
Julie Alexandra Mayer!

643
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,960
朱莉  扎克  这太荒唐了
Oh, Julie! Zach, this is ridiculous.

644
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,650
你们不能永远憋着气吧
You can't hold your breath for ever!

645
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,200
你们最好待在下面
You might as well stay under

646
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,120
永远别上来换气
there and never come up for air,

647
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,320
要是上来
'cause when you do,

648
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,250
我就亲手掐死你们
I'm gonna choke the living daylights out of you!

649
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:29,090
我女儿在下面吗
Is my daughter under there?

650
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,410
我不是  我不是同性恋  
I'm not... I'm not gay!

651
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:42,650
我  我  对不起
Oh... I... Ok. I... I'm sorry.

652
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,680
我就把  就把这个放在这儿
Uh, I'll just... I'm just gonna leave those right there.

653
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,120
我没事  很好  你们就
I'm fine. It's good. You just, you know...

654
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:58,130
你们看见过   算了  再见
Did you see...? No! Goodbye.

655
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,800
卖掉房子  你疯了吗
Sell the house? Are you crazy?

656
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,960
卡洛斯  我们住不起这里了
Carlos, we can't afford to live here any more.

657
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,660
要是律师能让
If the lawyer gets

658
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:11,770
司法部解冻了那些账户
the justice department to unfreeze the bank accounts...

659
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,900
那会怎样  
Then what? Huh?

660
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,190
我们会有成千上万的诉讼账单
We have tons of legal bills.

661
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:18,750
即使把我们的积蓄搭进去  我们也完蛋了
And even with our savings, we're screwed.

662
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,880
但是
But...

663
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:25,820
这是我们的家  
It's our house.

664
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:28,620
我也爱这里  只是
I love this place too. It's just...

665
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:31,250
我们该面对现实了
It's time for us to face the music.

666
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:57,120
我从没想过会在人生的这个阶段变成穷人
I never thought I'd be poor at this stage of my life.

667
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:03,860
卡洛斯  我曾经破产过好几次
You know, Carlos, I've been broke a lot of times in my life.

668
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:05,650
但我从来没穷过
But I've never been poor.

669
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:08,200
因为  穷只是一种心态
Because poor is just a state of mind.

670
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:12,300
现在  你和我只是
And right now, you and I are just...

671
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,400
缺少资金
Without funds?

672
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:16,840
没错
Exactly.

673
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:25,250
我们可以找一间公寓  重新来过
I guess we could get an apartment, start over.

674
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:30,010
也许吧  也许会很好玩的
Who knows? It might even be fun.

675
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:35,830
一旦我们东山再起
And once we're back on our feet,

676
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,120
我们要买一所跟这一样大的房子
we'll get a house as big as this one.

677
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,060
要更大的
Bigger.

678
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,320
我老婆生日的时候  我送给她那条狗
I get my wife this dog for her birthday.

679
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,020
从收容所领养的
Stray from the pound.

680
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,300
是我送过她的最便宜的礼物了
Cheapest gift I've ever gotten her.

681
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,300
她很喜欢它  我是个天才吧
She loves it. So I'm a genius, right?

682
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,590
后来我发现  它患有奇怪的血液病
Then I find out it's got this weird blood disease.

683
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:12,600
现在我每个月要花600块买药  我还是天才吗
Now I'm laying out $600 a month for doggie medicine. Am I a genius?

684
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,120
别挖苦自己  你做了好事
Don't be cynical. You did something nice.

685
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,960
你让你妻子很开心
You made your wife happy.

686
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:21,970
现在我们来谈谈会让你开心的事
Now, let's talk about what's gonna make you happy.

687
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:31,980
是的  郊区的每一个早晨
Yes, each new day in suburbia

688
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:35,380
都伴随着一系列新的谎言
brings with it a new set of lies.

689
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:38,190
最糟糕的  是那些  
The worst are the ones we tell

690
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:40,980
我们在睡前告诉自己的话
ourselves before we fall asleep.

691
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:44,650
我们在黑暗中轻声告诉自己
We whisper them in the dark,

692
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:46,190
我们是快乐的
telling ourselves we're happy.

693
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:51,340
或者  他是快乐的
Or, that he's happy.

694
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,130
我们会改变
That we can change.

695
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:03,140
或者  他会改变主意
Or that he will change his mind.

696
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,980
我们说服自己  我们能原谅自己的罪过
We persuade ourselves we can live with our sins...

697
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:24,560
或者  我们没有他也能生活
...Or that we can live without him.

698
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:30,410
是的  每个入睡前的夜晚  
Yes, each night before we fall asleep

699
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:32,340
我们对自己说谎
we lie to ourselves,

700
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:37,710
无比急切地希望  清晨来临时
in the desperate, desperate hope, that come morning,

701
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:40,010
一切都会成真
it will all be true.
