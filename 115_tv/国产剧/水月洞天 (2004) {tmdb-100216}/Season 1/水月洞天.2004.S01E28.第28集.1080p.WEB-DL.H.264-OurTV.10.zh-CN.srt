296
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,290
Whereas I have absolutely
nothing to show for

297
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:29,190
all of my hard work...
until now.

298
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:34,280
So we're going to do things
my way until I get what I want.

299
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,240
>> Eve: God, I can't make
Victor hire you!

300
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,190
>> Xander: Huh.
Well, then...

301
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:42,210
I'll just have to settle for
mucking up all of your plans,

302
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:50,120
won't I?
Works for me.

303
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,110
>> Jack: I'm tired of hearing
about a past I don't know

304
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:55,100
or remember.
And there's no magic potion

305
00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:00,010
that's gonna bring my
memory back either.

306
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,010
>> Jennifer: Actually, there is,
and he's standing

307
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:03,280
right over there.

308
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:10,050
>> Jack: Who's he?
>> Jennifer: His name

309
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:12,260
is Will Horton...
and you two have a lot

310
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:17,140
in common.
>> Sonny: My Uncle Vic says

311
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,190
you've been sniffing around
Xander ever since he showed up.

312
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,070
You do know he's straight,
right?

313
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:23,000
>> Leo: I'm desperate,
all right?

314
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I haven't gotten any action
from my husband since way

315
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,290
before the wedding.
All of a sudden, this really

316
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:30,040
good-looking guy shows up...
often wearing very little.

317
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,140
So yes, in exchange for sex,
I offered up the leverage

318
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,200
I had over you.
>> Sonny: You didn't!

319
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,230
>> Leo: I did.
Figured Uncle Vic would do

320
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,030
anything to get his hands on
those photos I have of you

321
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:45,030
and Will disposing of my carcass
that he would make Xander CEO.

322
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,140
>> Sonny: Does Xander have
those photos?

323
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,210
>> Leo: No.
He didn't deliver the goods,

324
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:51,160
so neither did I.
But that does not mean

325
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,190
you are off the hook.
>> Sonny: What does that mean?

326
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:56,000
>> Leo: It means I'm horny.
And if you don't make me happy--

327
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,030
often--I can still give Xander
those photos.

328
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:02,290
Or I can give them
to the press...

329
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:07,210
or to the cops.
So many options, really,

330
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:20,080
all of them bad for you.
Makes my head spin.

331
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,240
>> Leo: Come on, Sonny.
What's the big deal?

332
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,070
Aren't you sick of living
like a monk?

333
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,260
>> Sonny: Yes, I am
really sick of it.

334
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:30,030
But sleeping with someone that
disgusts me is not the answer.

335
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,010
>> Leo: I know.
You want meaningful sex with

336
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,230
Will, the love of your life.
But I don't see that happening,

337
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:39,180
not anytime soon.
And you're a young,

338
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:43,100
sexy guy with needs.
>> Sonny: Do you really think

339
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,050
you can blackmail your way
into my bed?

340
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,140
>> Leo: A guy's gotta do
what a guy's gotta do.

341
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:52,000
I have nothing to lose.
But you, you could end up

342
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,200
in prison.
And in prison, you'll be

343
00:18:54,200 --> 00:19:00,010
referred to as "pretty."
Come on, Sonny.

344
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:06,010
It'll be our secret.
I won't tell Will if you won't.

345
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:09,090
>> Jennifer: Um, Jack.
Will, you remember Jack, right?

346
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:11,050
>> Will: Sure.
Yeah, I've--I've known you

347
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:15,030
all my life.
>> Jennifer: Will got...

348
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,200
caught up in Dr. Rolf's magic,
too, and lost his memory

349
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,000
in the process.
>> Jack: Well, then how do you

350
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,160
know that you've known me?
>> Will: Uh, that's a good

351
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,050
question.
Uh, Rolf actually developed

352
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,210
a serum that could counteract
the--the side effect

353
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:33,050
of the drug.
>> Jack: You're kidding.

354
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,210
>> Will: Yep, it took a couple
of injections, but then stuff

355
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:38,260
started coming back to me, and
now I, uh--I remember

356
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,280
everything.
>> Jack: All right.

357
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,160
So--so where is this drug?
Where do I get it?

358
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,020
>> Jennifer: Well, the FDA
has it right now.

359
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,140
Kayla told me that the hospital
had to turn it over to the FDA

360
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,240
for testing, and--and--and it's
just a long process, Jack.

361
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,140
>> Jack: Long. Okay, long.
How long is long?

362
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,280
>> Jennifer: I don't know.
I mean, it could take years,

363
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,150
but--
>> Jack: Years?

364
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:59,280
Oh, great.
Never--never mind.

365
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,150
>> Will: What about, uh, Rolf's
original notes from his diary?

366
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:06,050
>> Jennifer: Seth Burns
lost it, apparently.

367
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:07,230
>> Jack: Oh, this gets better
and better, doesn't it?

368
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,060
>> Jennifer: I know, Jack.
I know.

369
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:12,110
>> Jack: That--that's all right.
Okay, Will, you tell me,

370
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,220
are you glad that you got
your memory back?

371
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:18,270
>> Will: Um...
well, it was--it was

372
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:21,070
a big relief,
but at the same time,

373
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,170
it did make my life
a little more complicated

374
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:25,020
than it had been.
>> Jack: Complicated,

375
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,150
complicated.
>> Will: Yes.

376
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:28,220
>> Jack: How?
>> Will: Well, um,

377
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,090
when your memory is a blank
slate, you can kind of--

378
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:33,230
you can reinvent yourself,
you know?

379
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,080
You can choose who you want
to be.

380
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:40,020
But when it all comes back,
you have to live with the--

381
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,260
you know, with the memories
of the things that you did

382
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:44,270
that you regret.
>> Jack: Right.

383
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:48,230
Right. I got that.
>> Will: But even if you

384
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:51,050
don't get your memory back,
you don't live in that, uh--

385
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:54,000
that guilt-free state that
you're in when you first

386
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,260
open your eyes, you know?
>> Jack: Oh, yeah.

387
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,280
Yeah, that phase is over
pretty quick, isn't it?

388
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,080
>> Will: So whether you want to
or not, you know

389
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,130
you hurt people.
Sometimes it's the people

390
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,230
that you really, really love.

391
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:16,080
>> Xander: Yes.
All I have to do is turn this

392
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,000
over to some deserving soul,
and they'll mix up a big batch

393
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,280
of that serum.
And soon word will spread of

394
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:26,070
this miracle cure for amnesia,
and Jack will come running

395
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:29,040
to take his medicine
and then go running back to his

396
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,170
deserving, grateful family.
>> Eve: Ugh.

397
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:37,070
>> Xander: And poor old Eve,
oh, she'll be stuck out

398
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:43,130
on her ass again.
Clock's ticking, love.

399
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:45,180
>> Eve: Xander, what do you
expect me to do?

400
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,100
I'm not the one that blew it
with Victor.

401
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,010
You did that all by yourself.
>> Xander: What you gave me

402
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,290
wasn't big enough to overcome
Victor's hatred.

403
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:54,190
>> Eve: Oh, my God,
Victor hates me too.

404
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:57,290
But I had to convince him
that he needed me.

405
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:01,250
Then we were able to work
together.

406
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,170
I mean, what have you got
to offer him as a CEO?

407
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:07,190
All you know is
hurting people and killing.

408
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:10,070
So, you know, why don't you
leave town?

409
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:12,070
'Cause everybody hates
your guts.

410
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:15,010
>> Xander: Not everyone.
More than one person

411
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:19,180
found me quite desirable.
>> Sarah: You heard Eric

412
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,060
before he left.
It's pretty clear that he wants

413
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,010
nothing to do with me.
>> Rex: Well, I'll go talk

414
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,110
to him.
>> Sarah: No.

415
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,230
>> Rex: Let me talk to him.
I'll tell him it's my fault.

416
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,130
>> Sarah: Just let it be.
You've done enough!

417
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:30,030
>> Rex: Look, just...
Okay, come on,

418
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,010
please don't go anywhere.
I just--

419
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:34,150
>> Sarah: I just said
I don't want you to talk to him.

420
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:37,010
>> Rex: I don't want to talk
about Eric.

421
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:44,260
I want to talk about us
and where we go from here.

422
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,180
>> Eric: Sarah and I, we've
gotten really close since she

423
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:50,090
came back to Salem, and, uh...
you know, she's been kind to me

424
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:54,240
after I lost Nicole.
She's been supportive, you know,

425
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,060
when Chloe and I were arguing
about who would raise Holly.

426
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,140
>> Marlena: Yeah.
Y-you said that you--

427
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,170
you can't believe what she did
to you.

428
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:06,270
>> Eric: I found her in bed
with Xander.

429
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:08,260
>> Marlena: What?
>> Eric: Yeah.

430
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,140
You know, I mean, how could she
do that to herself,

431
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,250
I mean, to me?
>> Marlena: Well, my first

432
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,170
thought is, I'm--I'm not sure
it has anything to do with you.

433
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:20,150
>> Eric: No, it did.
>> Marlena: Why?

434
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,130
Why do you think so?
>> Eric: Because before she

435
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:25,140
slept with Xander, she was
trying to have sex with me.

436
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:29,010
She was determined to make Rex
pay for what he did.

437
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:30,270
>> Marlena: With Mimi?
>> Eric: No, because he slept

438
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:34,210
with N--
he slept with Noelle.

439
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:36,230
>> Marlena: Oh, her sister.
Well, no wonder she was

440
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:39,170
distraught.
>> Eric: Mom, I wasn't very
