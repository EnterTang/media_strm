00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,989
This is BBC world news today, with me Philippa Thomas. Egyptians are

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,989
being urged to vote yes to a new constitution endorsed by the

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,989
military. We are watching the turnout and the turbulence, we will

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,989
have the latest from Cairo on day one of the vote.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,989
When all the votes have been cast it looks certain to be approved by a

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,989
comfortable majority. But the key issue is the turnout.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,989
President Hollande tells packed news conference this is not the place nor

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,989
the time to discuss his alleged affair, private means private says

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,989
the French President. Also coming up, how the booming

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,989
property market in London is directly affected by economic and

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,989
political crises from Spain to south Asia. We will talk to the man

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,989
charting the impact of global affairs on property prices in the UK

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,989
capital. Poor fellow shot dead lying in all directions. The horrors of

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,989
World War I, in the words of the soldiers themselves, now their

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:26,989
diaries are being published on-line. Hello and welcome, Egyptians are

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:35,989
voting on a new constitution which could pave the way for the head of

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,989
the army to run for President. This is the first vote Since the elected

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,989
President Mohammed Morsi was he overthrown in July. The Muslim

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,989
Brotherhood has been named a terrorist organisation since then

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,989
and its supporters are boycotting the referendum. Since voting nine

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,989
protestors have been killed. In central Cairo an eager queue before

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,989
the polls opened. This is the third constitutional referendum in as many

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,989
years. And many hope it will bring an end to turmoil and unrest.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,989
This woman, a housewife, who was one of the first in line. She told us

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,989
she would have queued all night, because the constitution will help

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,989
Egypt overcome a crisis. I want to for all the people in Egypt to come

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,989
now and say yes and this is the best for our country. It is the first

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,989
time Egyptians have gone to the polls since their elected President,

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,989
Mohammed Morsi, was ousted last July. He was removed by the army in

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,989
a popular low-backed coup. The military wants this vote to endorse

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,989
his removal. There is steady team of people coming to cast their ballot

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,989
and more queueing to get in. The referendum is a key test for the

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,989
authorities. They say the constitution represents the new

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,989
democratic Egypt. Now when all the votes have been cast it looks

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,989
certain to be approved by a comfortable majority. But the key

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,989
issue is the turnout. Especially for the army chief, General Abdel Fattah

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,989
el-Sisi, barely visible in the throng as he inspected a polling

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,989
station. A convincing result in the referendum could kick-start a

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,989
presidential bid. He's already shaking hands like a politician. The

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,989
constitution bolsters the economic and political power of the military.

41
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,989
It allows military trials for civilians. But it also promises

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,989
improved human rights. People were arrested because of these posters.

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,989
Opponents say they have been silenced and harassed. Putting up

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,989
these posters calling for a "no" vote, has meant arrest and terrorism

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,989
charges for seven political activists. Moderate Islamists say

46
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,989
the authorities are giving voters no option. As long as they are pushing

47
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,989
to one direction, which is one choice only, only "yes", it is not a

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,989
referendum or not a democratic process at all. You won't vote? We

49
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,989
will not vote. And supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood are not voting

50
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,989
either, they have been protesting in several locations. The organisation,

51
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,989
now declared a terrorist group, has called for a boycott cott of the

52
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,989
vote, saying the constitution is stained with blood. If it is passed

53
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:44,989
as expected, it may harden the divisions here, not heel them. We

54
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,989
have a Middle East expert with the Brooksings Institution and the Royal

55
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,989
United Services Institute and he joins us via webcam from Cairo.

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,989
Thank you for being with us on world news today. We heard Orla there

57
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,989
talking about the turnout being key, what is your reading of the way the

58
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,989
turnout is looking and how high it would have to be for the general to

59
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,989
run for President? It is a little bit early to say what turnout

60
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,989
actually looks like, keeping in mind that most of the coverage we have

61
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,989
seen thus far is really on Cairo. It is not around the country. Polling

62
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,989
has stopped for today, it is 9.00, tomorrow is still another day, it

63
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,989
will be a full day and I suspect we won't really be able to tell what

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,989
turnout is like until tomorrow. Some people are comparing turnout at

65
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,989
certain polling stations and parts of Cairo today, with what it was in

66
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,989
2012, but there are different numbers of polling stations this

67
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,989
year as well. So I think it is early for us to start talking about

68
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,989
turnout. In terms of what is required I don't really know if

69
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,989
that's the correct question. Regardless of turnout over the next

70
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,989
couple of days, I think that General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has made his

71
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,989
calculation and will follow through with it regardless of the turnout.

72
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,989
It has been hard to put it mildly, to campaign for a "no" vote, there

73
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,989
has been repression of that campaign? Absolutely. This is

74
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,989
something that people need to be very aware of, that while there

75
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,989
isn't any evidence of ballot box stuffing and things like that a fair

76
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,989
vote, this definitely is not. The last few days has seen people get

77
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,989
arrested for campaigning for a "no" vote, and being released eventually,

78
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,989
but still being arrested for campaigning in that fashion. The

79
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,989
apparatus, state TV and private TV has been very, very clear about its

80
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,989
only presenting one side of the argument, which is to vote for a

81
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,989
"yes" vote as opposed to a "no", a "fair" referendum it can't be

82
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,989
called. Do you have a view on whether this constitution is better

83
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,989
for the people of Egypt than the last one they were presented with?

84
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,989
There is some marginal differences there are some points about rights

85
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,989
that are in this new constitutional draft that weren't there in 2012,

86
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,989
the military has at least the same amount of protection and autonomous

87
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,989
position that it had in 2012 as well. That is not particularly

88
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,989
different. There are a couple of adjustments there, I don't think

89
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,989
much in the way of that either. You still have military trials for

90
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,989
civilian, you still have basic autonomy for the military, from the

91
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,989
executive and so on. And the articles are not really the issue

92
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,989
here. For me the process is far more important, and incidentally people

93
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,989
are not voting on this constitution, yes, no or boycott, on the basis of

94
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,989
the articles. That accounts I think for a small proportion of the

95
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,989
Egyptian population. People who are boycotting and generally boycotting

96
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,989
because either they don't recognise the legitimacy of the process that

97
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,989
brought the vote forward in the first place, that accounts for the

98
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,989
brotherhood and their allies, or they are voting "yes" as a sign that

99
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,989
they support the military and they oppose the Muslim Brotherhood and

100
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,989
looking for a more stable situation in Egypt. There hasn't been a

101
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,989
referendum in Egypt over the past three years it has come near a "no"

102
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,989
vote. "Yes "presented as the next stage of doability. Over the last

103
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,989
few years a huge number of voters want exactly that. Thank you very

104
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,989
much for joining us. Thank you. The French President, Francois Hollande,

105
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,989
has faced hundreds of journalists at his first news conference since a

106
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,989
magazine accused him of having a secret affair with an actress. But

107
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,989
that is not quite the situation it seems. This was his annual

108
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,989
conference in which he spoke in great detail about the French

109
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,989
economy and the Press Pack chose to pose just a single question, on

110
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:58,989
whether his official partner remains the French First Lady. The glamour

111
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,989
of the big screen, Julie Gayet, the French actress who has stolen the

112
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,989
heart of the President. Cast in this drama as the femme F atale. Today it

113
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,989
was Mr Hollande's turn in the spotlight with the annual meeting

114
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,989
with the press. The official subject was the economy, cuts of 50 billion

115
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,989
years in public spending -- euros in public spending. But the big

116
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,989
question, what will become of the First Lady, Valerie Trierweiler.

117
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,989
TRANSLATION: Everyone in their private life goes through difficult

118
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,989
periods. It is true, these are difficult moments, but I have one

119
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,989
principle, private matters should be dealt with privately, that's the

120
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,989
same for everyone concerned. So this is not the place nor the time to

121
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,989
discuss it. But so long as the confusion surrounds the First Lady's

122
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,989
position it is likely these questions will continue. Valerie

123
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,989
Trierweiler is still in hospital, still "resting". We don't know how

124
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,989
many of these secret nights there were, but photographers who tailed

125
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,989
Mr Hollande, on his moped, say no-one ever tried to stop them.

126
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,989
TRANSLATION: We were there every night, the President was in an

127
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,989
apartment without any security. Even outside. I even saw the President

128
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,989
walk around the block. The public and the private, boundaries blurred

129
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,989
by the unnecessary risks Mr Hollande is said to have taken. Right now it

130
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,989
is the President's judgment that is being debated, not his choice in

131
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,989
women. Now also in Paris for us, the French cultural commentator. Thank

132
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,989
you for joining us, when President Hollande gave his non-answer,

133
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,989
answer, at the news conference, was that appropriate to French ears? It

134
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:05,989
was certainly not surprising. We didn't expect him to suddenly open

135
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,989
his heart to the French people. We did expect, perhaps a statement,

136
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,989
before the press conference, just to clear the way, a way to clarify his

137
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,989
position. But because his partner, Valerie Trierweiler, is still in

138
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,989
hospital, that was deemed not the right moment to actually issue that

139
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,989
statement. It did, however, and that's probably the most interesting

140
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,989
point on that topic, during his two-and-a-half hours of press

141
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,989
conference, that he would clarify his personal situation before going

142
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,989
on an official visit to Washington. That is in three weeks time. We

143
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,989
should know very soon if indeed Valerie Trierweiler remains France's

144
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,989
First Lady. Will the public mind or care whether he goes alone to

145
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,989
Washington? No, of course not. And perhaps, you know, perhaps he

146
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,989
regrets having introduced his partner to the nation at large. She

147
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:16,989
could, probably should have remained in the shadows. It would be easier

148
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,989
for him, also don't forget that the concept of First Lady is viewed as

149
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,989
an American concept in France, and doesn't have any clear status and is

150
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:38,989
a very ill-defined position. It depends on the President in exercise

151
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,989
whether to give the first partner any staff or any public function.

152
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,989
And yes, let's get to the issue that may well matter more to the French

153
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,989
people themselves, much of this lengthy news conference was about

154
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,989
the economic programme for the country and we're talking about cuts

155
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,989
in public spending, cuts in taxes, is this what was expected or does

156
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,989
that come as something of a shock? I'm very glad you mentioned the most

157
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,989
important part of his press conference. Because he had prepared

158
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:15,989
a lot for the third press conference of his presidency. And yes, he did

159
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,989
announce some interesting policies. You know, there has been talk that

160
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,989
for a long time that he's not a socialist really, but a social

161
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,989
democrat. I think that was the first policies, Social Democratic policies

162
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:37,989
that he was announcing for the first time since being elected to power.

163
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,989
Indeed he has announced 15 billion euros of cuts in public spending.

164
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,989
But also a big chunk of social charges that are quite hefty in

165
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,989
France and paid by employers that would be simply scrapped. So a lot

166
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,989
of things. He also talked about Europe, he talked about

167
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,989
unemployment, about anti-semitism in France and also about military

168
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,989
operations in Mali and Central African Republic. Let's give you a

169
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,989
brief look at some of the day's other news. Reports from south Sudan

170
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,989
say at least 200 people have died in a ferry accident. They boarded the

171
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,989
overcrowded boat while trying to escape fighting in the city. Rebels

172
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,989
loyal to the former deputy President claim they have since captured

173
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,989
Malakal from Government forces. A new survey of lions has found they

174
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,989
could face extinction in west Africa, fewer than 400 are left in

175
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,989
the region. The research was carried out in 17 countries, from Senegal to

176
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,989
Nigeria, taking more than six years. With fewer than 250 lions of

177
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:01,989
breeding age left, there are concerns the entire population could

178
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,989
disappear. A doctor in northern China has been given a suspended

179
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,989
death sentence for stealing new born babies and selling them to child

180
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,989
traffickers. The obstetrician convinced the parents that their

181
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:22,989
babies had serious health problems and should be cared for by the

182
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,989
state. Paraded in front of a courtroom, Dr Zhang Shuxia was

183
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,989
convicted of selling seven infants to a child trafficking ring. She

184
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,989
received a suspended death prison, usually changed to life in prison

185
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,989
after two years of good behaviour. It was at this hospital where the

186
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,989
respected obstetrician had lied to new parents, telling them their new

187
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,989
borns were seriously ill. If they handed their children over to the

188
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,989
state, families were told, the babies would receive the expensive

189
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,989
medical care they needed. When police broke up the ring, seven

190
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,989
healthy new borns had already been sold, leading to multiple arrests.

191
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,989
And several triumphant home Cummings, as police returned the

192
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,989
abducted children to their rightful parents. All except one child, sold

193
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,989
for just $165, abandoned by the traffickers. Some outraged Chinese

194
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,989
citizens argued that the doctor should die for her crimes. In this

195
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,989
country where child trafficking is relatively common, a suspended death

196
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,989
sentence is too lenient, they said. The Nigerian authorities say 30

197
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,989
people have been killed by a bomb explosion in the north eastern city

198
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,989
of Maiduguri. The blast ripped through a packed market in t early

199
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,989
afternoon, causing panic as people tried to flee the scene on foot and

200
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,989
by car. Some reports suggest the bomb was planted in a motor Rick

201
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,989
saw, or a sack abandoned by a stall. The Islamist group, Boko Haram said

202
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,989
it carried out the attack. The British Government has ordered an

203
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:03,989
urgent investigation into whether the UK was involved in deadly raid

204
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,989
on a Sikh temple in the Indian city of Amritza in 1984. Recently

205
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,989
unclassified documents suggest that an SAS officer advised Indian

206
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,989
authorities prior to the storming of the Golden Temple where hundreds

207
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,989
died. The storming of the Golden Temple in the area angered Sikhs

208
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,989
around the world, who blamed Indian troops for violating their holyist

209
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,989
shrine. Now documents released under the 30-year rule, apparently show

210
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,989
the British were involved. One Foreign Office letter says "with the

211
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,989
Prime Minister's agreement, an SAD officer has visited India and drawn

212
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,989
up a plan, which has been approved by Mrs Gandhi". There appears to be

213
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,989
a typing error that should read SAS. The letter warns it could increase

214
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,989
violence in India and warns it might also therefore increase tension in

215
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,989
the Indian community here. Particularly if knowledge of the SAS

216
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,989
involvement were to become public. Some MPs believe all the evidence of

217
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,989
British involvement must now be released. I think there are further

218
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,989
documentation, what we want is a full, candid, disclosure of all

219
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,989
explanations so we can get to the bottom exactly what happened here.

220
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,989
Even after 30 years Sikhs here in Britain want to know the truth about

221
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,989
what happened at Amritza, we are told neither David Cameron or the

222
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,989
Foreign Secretary, William Hague, were aware of the documents

223
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,989
suggesting Britain's involvement until they were published. But that

224
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,989
they do understand the very legitimate concerns that will be

225
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,989
raised by the revelations. At the largest Sikh temple outside India,

226
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,989
in Southall west London a community leader welcomed the Prime Minister's

227
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:55,989
decision to ask the cabinet secretary to investigate. This is a

228
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,989
holy place. For any religion, it is a heart-breaking thing. These things

229
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,989
do not go out from your mind. It is not a small thing. That is why if

230
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,989
the truth has come out, at least people know. Last year David Cameron

231
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,989
became the first serving British Prime Minister to visit the Golden

232
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,989
Temple. He is keen to focus on the historic and cultural ties with

233
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,989
Sikh, but now he's under pressure to uncover more about Britain's role in

234
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:33,989
an event which is seared into their history. London is a property hot

235
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,989
spot, viewed by many around the world as a safe bet when it comes to

236
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,989
real estate, now a new study has found that conflicts, turmoil and

237
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,989
general instability outside the UK have a direct impact on the price

238
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,989
paid for bricks and mortar here in the British capital. The study was

239
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:01,989
put together by the Business Cool of the University of Oxford, they found

240
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,989
that property here recorded the largest increases. The same patterns

241
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,989
can be seen with troubles in Egypt and Greece, another part of their

242
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,989
research looks at London's wealthiest areas, places like

243
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,989
Knightsbridge, the study concluding that China had the biggest impact on

244
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,989
the city's highend real estate prices. Instability in Russia and

245
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,989
Libya also pushed prices up in London's premier property market.

246
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,989
With me is a representative from the Business School of the University of

247
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,989
Oxford. You co-authored the report, we know about the idea as property

248
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,989
as a safe haven and safe investment, you go beyond that don't you? That's

249
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,989
right, our launching off point is London is not a big non-know lithic

250
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,989
eptity but composed of many little region, because we all live in parts

251
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,989
of London, we don't live in the whole place. You can link and map

252
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,989
particular parts of London to particular foreign countries, either

253
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,989
by using things like the language, the principal language spoken in the

254
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,989
regions or the share of residents that originate from those countries.

255
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,989
That is our launching off point for this particular thing. Some of the

256
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,989
research that you have come up with, for example, looks at southern

257
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,989
Europe, Italy, Spain, Greece and normally people talk about maybe the

258
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,989
Chinese or Arab money, but southern Europe and the euro crisis features

259
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,989
highly? One of the ways to think about this is when political

260
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,989
uncertainty went up in Spain, the prices came up in London across the

261
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,989
board, but specifically regions linked to Spain, such as high-income

262
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,989
areas, such as St John's Wood, would have appreciated. But areas like

263
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,989
King's Cross would have appreciated at the same time, they have also a

264
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,989
high share of Spanish residents. So it is an uncertainty, as you say, in

265
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,989
southern Europe, because it is a large factor in the real estate

266
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,989
prices. It is not just the real estate priority, looking at the

267
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,989
Shard in London, it is owned by Qatar, but you have also looked at

268
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,989
lower income areas, and they are still influenced by nationalities

269
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,989
who tend to cluster. Absolutely, that's right. You do see the usual

270
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,989
effects that you would have expected to see in Mayfair or Knightsbridge

271
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,989
or the popular areas and wealthy areas, but you also see effects in

272
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,989
areas which are also inhabited by clusters of regional communities.

273
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,989
One of the reassuring things of the research is we show the effects are

274
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,989
not permanent. One of the things people tend to think about safe

275
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,989
haven effects, that they push prices up and prices stay up forever. That

276
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,989
is not the case. When political uncertainty rises prices go up, when

277
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,989
the uncertainty dissipates prices go back down over one or two years.

278
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,989
That suggests a pattern of people moving their capital in and out of

279
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,989
London and not taking up residence in London. Which means you get back

280
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,989
to what Londoners say that a lot of homes are not actually homes? That I

281
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,989
suppose is a very true statement that you are making there. Another

282
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,989
way to sort of portray that, perhaps, is the fact that while

283
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,989
these effects are temporary on the prices of houses. It reaches the

284
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,989
local community which is the internationalisation of London,

285
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,989
which perhaps is a very nice thing about this. It is fascinating,

286
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,989
London is one of those global cities, thank you very much for

287
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,989
coming to talk it all through with me.

288
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,989
Now it was called the war to end all war, those who fought it lived

289
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,989
through brutality that was almost impossible for families back home to

290
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,989
imagine. But now, for the first time, many of the diaries written by

291
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,989
soldiers written on the frontline are being published by the National

292
00:23:49,000 --> 00:24:00,989
Archives here. 300,000 pages of personal testimony released so far.

293
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,989
A picture of the war itself. "Here I sit outside our headquarters' trench

294
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,989
in the sun. All should be nice and peaceful and pretty what it actually

295
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,989
is, is beyond description. Trenches, ammunition tool, caps et cetera, et

296
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,989
cetera, everywhere, poor fells shot dead are lying in all directions."

297
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,989
Thousands of war diaries, 1. 5 million separate documents. Once the

298
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,989
fodder for authors and researchers, now they are available for the first

299
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,989
time at the click of a mouse. "The order to retire was at last given...

300
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,989
" These are the last days of the men in a giant army, the attacks, the

301
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,989
food, the horrific casualties, neatly typed on to official military

302
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,989
forms and stored away for decades. The names carved on to our local war

303
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,989
memorials are the most obvious reminders of the war, all of us will

304
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,989
have a direct connection with somebody who served in this

305
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,989
conflict. The hope is that these diaries released into the public

306
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:11,989
domain will give more and more people the opportunity to follow a

307
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,989
personal trail. This is Operation War Diary, under way at a school in

308
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,989
Southampton. Students reading the unseen documents are tagging names

309
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,989
and events, adding to their own knowledge and improving the

310
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,989
archive's search engine. They talk about their supplies from the battle

311
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,989
for their cooking. From the sounds of it they are getting quite annoyed

312
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,989
because their supplies aren't reaching all the way through. It

313
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,989
just shows you what happens behind the scenes and how these men

314
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,989
actually lived and what the quality of their lives were at that time.

315
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,989
You read it and you take it in but when you then have to specifically

316
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,989
point out things, it again just immerses you even more. Holes where

317
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,989
shells had struck, branches torn off trees by the explosion. Everywhere

318
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,989
the same hard, grim, pitiless sign of battle and war. I have had a

319
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,989
belly full of it. Ghastly, absolutely ghastly.

320
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,989
The eyewitnesses have left us, but they survive through the curling

321
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,989
pages of their final observations. Just time to remind you of our main

322
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,989
news, Egyptians are voting on a new constitution that could pave the way
