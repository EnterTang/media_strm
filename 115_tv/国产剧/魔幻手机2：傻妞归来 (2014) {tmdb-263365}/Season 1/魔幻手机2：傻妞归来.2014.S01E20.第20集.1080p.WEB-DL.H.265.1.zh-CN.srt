1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,700
<i>Previously on</i>
<i>"The Mob Doctor"...</i>

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,700
As long as you're in Chicago,
I own you. That's the deal.

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,600
If you don't leave right now,
I am screaming for a cop.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,800
I am a cop.

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,900
Constantine's plans
are bigger than I imagined.

6
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,900
- What part of "off the case" don't you get?
- Got to find a way back in.

7
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm Dr. Devlin. You had me paged.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,100
I heard that you see patients off the grid.

9
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,800
It seems our old friend
Russell King is back in town.

10
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,200
My FBI handler wants me
hooked up with another crew.

11
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,600
Otherwise,
he's gonna pull me out.

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,200
King needs a guy.
That's me.

13
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,400
By tomorrow morning, I'll be rich,
and you'll be connected.

14
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,900
Franco crewed up with Russell.
It's gonna be challenging.

15
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,400
I like a good challenge.

16
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,000
You know, there was someone else
there with him -- Grace.

17
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,700
She helped Franco with Russell.

18
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,800
I'll deal with Grace
in my own time.

19
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,000
- Good morning.
- What took you so long?

20
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,200
You called an hour ago.

21
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,300
Roll up your sleeve.
Let's go.

22
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,700
This isn't a medical issue,
so you can put your bag away.

23
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,200
- Sit down.
- Okay.

24
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,400
I've been waiting for you
to come to me and explain yourself.

25
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,800
What are you talking about?

26
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,100
What the hell were you doing
with Franco?

27
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,700
You, Franco, Russell King --

28
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,100
Christmas Eve
outside the auction house.

29
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,500
Russell King is my patient.
He collapsed.

30
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,400
If I hadn't gone to see him,
he would have died.

31
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,900
And Franco?
He just happened to be there, too?

32
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,300
Yeah, that's right.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,400
So it was Franco who
referred Russell King to you?

34
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,400
I don't know,
but I would assume so, yeah.

35
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,600
- You should have called me.
- Why?

36
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,800
So you can kill Franco?

37
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,200
Look, I don't want to be
responsible for anybody's death,

38
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,100
including Franco's.

39
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,500
If this is all you need from me...

40
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,700
You want things to be strictly business
between you and me, that's fine.

41
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,100
But you're gonna tell me
everything you know about Franco.

42
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,200
Is he working for Russell King
in Detroit?

43
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,200
I have no idea.

44
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,200
You see him again,
you get ahold of me right away.

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,400
And you're right.

46
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,800
I do want him dead.

47
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,900
Hey. I was just thinking about you.

48
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,100
Constantine knows we were together.

49
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,100
He asked me if you and Russell
were in Detroit.

50
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,100
Well, what'd you tell him?

51
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,600
I said I didn't know.
I don't think he believed me.

52
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,800
The thing is I'm not in Detroit anymore.
I'm on my way back to Chicago.

53
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,700
No, you can't come here.
It's not safe.

54
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,000
Detroit's economy's in the toilet, Grace.
There's no money there.

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,400
If I get Russell
hooked up in Chicago,

56
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,200
I find a way back in,
and I get his protection.

57
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,600
But if it weren't for you,
he would be dead. Isn't that enough?

58
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,600
Unfortunately, saving his life
doesn't put money in his pocket.

59
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,300
I need to prove I'm an earner.

60
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,900
The FBI wants me
on the inside, Grace.

61
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,500
Otherwise I'm useless to them.

62
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,000
It's just if anything
happened to you, I, um --

63
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,600
hey, it's you and me
versus the world, babe.

64
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,500
And I'm betting on us.

65
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,700
Where you going, twinkle toes?

66
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,500
A bet's a bet, and you lost.

67
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,300
Can't I give you each 20 bucks?
We'll call it even?

68
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,400
Come on.
Nobody wants your money.

69
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,300
- We want to see your fat ass dance.
- You're a jerk.

70
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,700
Shut up and shake your money maker.

71
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,000
Like you mean it.

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,100
- Do it for me.
- I love this! Very good!

73
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,800
Nate.

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,900
What's up?

75
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,900
Whenever these idiots
are done screwing around,

76
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,400
I want you to go with
Louis and Gio on some pickups.

77
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,500
Cool.

78
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,300
You're moving up quick, kid.

79
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,100
Keep up the good job.
The sky's the limit.

80
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,900
Cut that crap out.
Don't quit your day job, Benny.

81
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,200
I've been trying to get ahold of Tony M.
For a month.

82
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,600
Haven't got an answer back.

83
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,400
You make one phone call, and all of a sudden,
we get an invite.

84
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,900
Yeah, we go way back.

85
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,000
This guy can chop up a car
to the bolts in less than an hour.

86
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,100
If he's even half as good as you say,

87
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,400
you got a permanent spot
on my crew here in Chicago.

88
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,100
I'm counting on it.

89
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,600
Hey. Tony M.

90
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,500
Hey. Franco.

91
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,500
- Nice to see you breathing, kid.
- What's up, man?

92
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,500
Good to meet you.
I'm Tony M.

93
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,400
Franco says you're the real deal.

94
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,900
Is it true you boosted
the first truckload of vipers out of Flint?

95
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,600
- How'd you hear about that?
- I'm from Detroit.

96
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,700
Screw you.

97
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,400
Franco, I'm out.

98
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,400
- What's his deal?
- Let me go talk to him.

99
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,900
- What happened there?
- You never said he was from Detroit.

100
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,800
So what?

101
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,500
You know the Pistons knocked the Bulls
out of the playoffs three times in a row --

102
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,500
'88, '89, and '90.

103
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,100
I can't be around that guy.
Bad memories.

104
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,300
That was like 20 years ago, man.
It's not like he played on the team.

105
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,000
I lost 100 grand
on those games,

106
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,800
and I vowed never to work

107
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,500
with anybody from
that piece-of-crap city!

108
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,900
End of story!

109
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,500
He's a die-hard Bulls fan.

110
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,500
He was born and raised in Chicago.

111
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,700
- Hey, Russell. Where were you born?
- Humboldt Park.

112
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,900
Before or after the Mexicans moved in?

113
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,400
There ain't no Mexicans
in Humboldt Park.

114
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,700
It's all puerto rican.
But nice try.

115
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,000
Who's your favorite
all-time Bull?
And don't say Jordan.

116
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,200
Norm van Lier.

117
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,200
Stormin' Norman.
Now that's what I'm talking about.

118
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,400
Yeah, butterbean love.
Mickey Johnson.

119
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,800
I'll have you set up
in 24 hours.

120
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,500
Eight lifts, two box trucks
to move parts through the city.

121
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,200
And I got extra offices
in the back.

122
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,600
How about I get us box seats
to the Bulls game next week?

123
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,800
I think he's a couple quarters
short of a dollar.

124
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,600
Yeah, I'm more interested in the c-notes
we're gonna be bringing in.

125
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,300
Welcome aboard.

126
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,300
<i>Dr. Devlin to trauma room 4.</i>
<i>Dr. Devlin to trauma room 4.</i>

127
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,600
<i>Dr. Devlin to trauma room 4.</i>
<i>Dr. Devlin to...</i>

128
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,800
Everything all right,
Dr. Devlin?

129
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,100
Oh, yeah, I was just, uh,
paged to see a trauma patient.

130
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,700
- A priest.
- Yeah.

131
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,900
And you're standing out here
because?

132
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,200
Oh, it's just after my last confession,

133
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,700
I was supposed to
say 10 Hail Marys as penance,

134
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,800
and I haven't really
gotten around to it.

135
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,400
How long ago was that?

136
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,200
Before med school.

137
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm sure he'll forgive you.

138
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,700
Try saying the rosary sometime.
It never hurts.

139
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,100
Hello, Father.
I'm Dr. Devlin.

140
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,300
That's quite an infection
you have there.

141
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,300
Yes, I-I should have come in sooner,

142
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,400
but I kept hoping it would
get better on its own.

143
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,500
Well, can I ask you
what happened?

144
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,000
Of course. But it --
it may sound strange to you.

145
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,300
I've heard it all before.
You can tell me anything.

146
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,800
I've been performing an exorcism...

147
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,400
and two days ago,

148
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,200
while blessing my parishioner
with holy oil, I was attacked.

149
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,600
Attacked?

150
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,500
Yes. I was bitten by the demon.

drain your wound

155
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,900
and then give you
some intravenous antibiotics.

156
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,000
Thank you, doctor.

157
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,100
Judging from the teeth-mark impressions,
I'd say it's a human bite.

158
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,100
So, when you say...
"Demon"...

159
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,400
Well, I've been working on
my parishioner for a week now.

160
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,400
She would never deliberately harm me,

161
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,200
but the demon used her
as a vessel to lash out.

162
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,800
I've -- I've heard of exorcisms.

163
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,500
I was raised catholic.

164
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,900
But I've never met anyone
who's performed the rite.

165
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Well, I'm one of several priests in the state
sanctioned by the Vatican to exorcise.

166
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I let my guard down,

167
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,700
and I gave the demon
an opening to come after me.

168
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,200
Oh, Father Doyle, this is Dr. Robinson.
We'll be working together.

169
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
Hi.

170
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,700
Let's see here.

171
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,700
It's a two-day-old human bite,
surrounding cellulit.

172
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,700
It's pretty deep.

173
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,200
Okay, we're gonna have to do a facial C.T.
To make sure the infection doesn't track into the brain.

174
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,900
The nurse is gonna take you for your scan,

175
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,100
and I will meet you
back in the patient room.

176
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,000
Okay, see you soon.

177
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,200
An exorcism in 2013?

178
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,300
It's an attempt to eradicate evil.
In theory, there's nothing wrong with that.

179
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,600
This guy thinks demons are real.

180
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,000
Demons -- the things
that take over your body

181
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,500
and puke green-pea soup
all over the place.

182
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,900
Okay. That's enough.

183
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,500
Are you taking this guy seriously?

184
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,500
I don't know if demons are real.

185
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,900
I know evil exists.

186
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,600
- Russell.
- Hey.

187
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,600
I'm glad you decided to meet.

188
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,300
I see you got your appetite back.

189
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,300
Yeah, I didn't realize
how much I missed Chicago beef.

190
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,700
Well, I'm glad you're
enjoying the local cuisine.

191
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,400
If you like, I can get you
a little water to wash that down.

192
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,200
Water. Yeah, that's funny.

193
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,100
You tried to drown me
the last time I was here.

194
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,700
I warned you,
but you didn't listen.

195
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,400
I want to tell you something...
Out of respect.

196
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,700
Me and my crew
are setting up shop.

197
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,300
Not without kicking up
to the syndicate you're not --

198
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,700
- my syndicate.
- No, no, no, no, no.

199
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,000
You're South side.
This is downtown.

200
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,600
It's no man's land.

201
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,700
I'll stay out of your way.
You stay out of mine.

202
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,100
Russell, you know why a thief
never robs the same home twice?

203
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,900
Because if he goes back,
the owner's gonna be ready for him.

204
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,600
This ain't your home.

205
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,400
What's it gonna take
for you to learn?

206
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,600
Look around! We're downtown.

207
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,100
Come after me again,
you better bring an army with you.

208
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,800
My whole crew's moving in.
Ain't nothing you're gonna do about it.

209
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,900
Enjoy your day.

210
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,500
Okay, I'm just gonna pack the wound.

211
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,700
I'm not gonna give you stitches
so that it can continue to drain.

212
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,000
- Hey.
- Hello. I have good news.

213
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,600
Your facial C.T. is fine.
Your infection is localized.

214
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,700
- Does that mean I'm cleared to go?
- As soon as Dr. Robinson's finished.

215
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,700
Just need you to come back tomorrow
so we can change the packing.

216
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,400
I am... All done.

217
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,900
Thank you both.

218
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,600
- You okay?
- My leg is numb. I've just been sitting too long.

219
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,000
- Father Doyle, you all right?
- I can't move my leg.

220
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,000
- Grace, you're bleeding.
- I know. The scalpel.

221
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,400
All right, we got to deal with that.
Go to exam room "B." I'll be right there.

222
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,600
- You got it? I'll be right back.
- Come on.

223
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,600
All right, here we go.
Come on. Here we go.

224
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,400
- All right, let's do this.
- Oh, slow down, buddy.

225
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,400
You're gonna hang back on this one.
You can put that away.

226
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,900
Look, you never send everybody in to collect
because if you do and something goes down,

227
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,100
you need someone at the wheel, right?

228
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,300
So you're gonna hang with me.
We're gonna get him on the next one.

229
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,800
Yeah, that's 'cause at the next stop,
you got a thing for that waitress with the huge rack.

230
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,300
That's my future ex-wife
you're talking about, pal.

231
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,300
Keep the car running.
Shut your mouth.

232
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,200
Joey Riso, the guy who runs this place...

233
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,500
I took his daughter to prom last year.

234
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,900
- Prom?
- You're like 28.

235
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,000
Yeah, he was not too happy about that.

236
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,700
Throws me out of the limo
and stabs me with a fruit picker.

237
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,700
- Fruit picker?
- A fruit picker.

238
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,700
If the -- if the fruit is
too high up in the tree,

239
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,300
they get that claw out, and they
claw it down with a fruit picker.

240
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,200
Left a scar on my ass.

241
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,800
Nate, Gio! Grab him!

242
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,700
I got him! I got him!

243
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,100
He's just a kid.
What the hell, man?!

244
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,600
The cash ain't here!
Is he alive?

245
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,100
He has a pulse!
What happened?!

246
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,100
I went in there. I see this big guy.
He goes running out the back with a gun.

247
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,100
I turn around, I see Joey shot between the eyes
with an empty envelope in his hand.

248
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,000
- And this kid goes running out the front.
- All right, we got to get out of here.

249
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,600
We can't just leave him here. He knows
who shot Joey and who stole our money.

250
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,800
Pay-up was 5 grand.

251
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,700
All right. Then we shove him in the car,
and we get out of here. Nate, bring the car around.

252
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,000
- Nate! Now! The car!
- Make it quick!

253
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,400
You're bleeding me dry,
Dracula.

254
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,800
We got to run lfts,
a hepatitis panel,

255
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,800
and a rapid h.I.V. Test.
You know that.

256
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,800
How long will Father Doyle's tests take?

257
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,600
A few hours. But that guy's a priest.
I'm sure he's fine.

258
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,100
Sadly, that doesn't reassure me.

259
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,800
I miss you.

260
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,200
Hey, how you doing, Grace?

261
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,900
Oh, I'm -- I'm fine.
How is Father Doyle?

262
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,300
The strength is back in his leg.

263
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,700
Must have been
a transient ischemic attack.

264
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,900
Order an MRI?

265
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,900
And carotid studies.
It's in process.

266
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,200
You are taking the rest of the day off.
Body-fluid exposure.

267
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,600
Go home and relax --
hospital policy.

268
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,800
- Are you sure this place is cool?
- Yeah.

269
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,900
My uncle bought it at auction.
He's rehabbing it to flip.

270
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,000
We got to call Constantine
and tell him what happened.

271
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,300
How's that gonna look, huh?

272
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,000
A guy under his protection's dead,
and we're 5 grand short?

273
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,900
Right. This kid's the only shot
we got at saving our asses.

274
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,800
Well, what if the kid
doesn't wake up?

275
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,000
If the kid don't wake up, we find an incinerator,
and we toss him in it.

276
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,700
Whoa. Slow down.

277
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,100
You know what --
uh, let me call my sister.

278
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,500
- Hey, Nate.
- Hey.

279
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,300
So, uh, hypothetical question.

280
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,800
If somebody falls and hits their head
and then they're not waking up,

281
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,400
- what should you do?
- Did somebody actually fall, Nate?

282
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,200
Yeah, but I'm sure he's okay.

283
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,600
Okay?

284
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,200
I mean, he's got a pulse.
That's good, right?

285
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,000
Nate, tell me where you are
right now.

286
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,900
Brain MRI looks normal.
I don't see any evidence of stroke.

287
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,900
Stroke? I came in for a bite.

288
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,400
An infection increases the risk of clotting,
which could explain your weakness.

289
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,900
We also need to rule out
meningitis and encephalitis.

290
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:21,500
Which is why we need to collect
and examine your cerebral spinal fluid.

291
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,200
Could you please sit up and hang your feet
over the side of the bed?

292
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,700
It's also possible that
my condition is not medical.

293
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,300
You think that
you're possessed now.

294
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,900
Well, a demon can only
possess one person at a time,

295
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,400
but it will often attack
the exorcist during the rite.

296
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,200
Most priests are strong enough to fend it off,
but I've already shown that I'm vulnerable.

297
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,600
- I realize how that must sound to you.
- I don't think you do.

298
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
May I ask --
do you attend church?

299
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,800
When I was a kid.
With my mom.

300
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,700
Not lately.

301
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,300
No disrespect, but explaining
what I do to a nonbeliever is --

302
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,500
it's difficult.

303
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,200
Father, you don't need
to defend yourself to us.

304
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,800
I need you to lean over that.

305
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,900
All right.

306
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,200
Feel for the interspace at L4...

307
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,500
and advance in a cephalad direction

308
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,900
till you feel a pop.

309
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,300
We don't take our duties lightly.

310
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,800
Before we begin the exorcism rite,

311
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,400
we insist that
the person see a doctor.

312
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,100
We pray on the matter for days.

313
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,000
We consult with our bishops.

314
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,600
We exhaust every possible cause
of the affliction.

315
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,300
No one's questioning your faith.

316
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,900
We just need to do our job
as doctors.

317
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,800
I'm gonna need you
to stop moving, please.

318
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,900
I am the vessel of the lord,

319
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,500
and you are a disrespectful heathen
who will burn!

320
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,800
Father Doyle, I need you
to put the needle down!

321
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,100
You have no authority over me!

322
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,500
- Security!
- <i>Security...</i>

323
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,000
The devil is real. He's among us,
and he is coming for you!

324
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,100
This is a move that is long overdue

325
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,700
and unprecedented
in modern times.

326
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,100
Now, with the lake to the east,
our territory's surrounded.

327
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,400
That's why I say
downtown should be ours.

328
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,400
Call it by divine right.

329
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,000
You already run the entire South side.

330
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,400
How much more do you need?

331
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,900
Look, this is not about me.

332
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,300
This is about outsiders like
Russell King coming to Chicago

333
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,200
and setting up a chop shop
and not paying up to us.

334
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,900
It shouldn't happen.
But downtown is too high-profile.

335
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,300
Every crime that happens
downtown winds up on the news,

336
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,200
and the cops need a face to pin it on.
And it's not gonna be mine.

337
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,300
I'd love to pin something on your face.

338
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,600
- You are a pig.
- All right, listen up.

339
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,500
2,000 years ago, Rome was
being attacked from all sides,

340
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,600
including within its walls
by corrupt politicians.

341
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,100
- Sounds a lot like Chicago.
- That's why three men --

342
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,300
Marcus Crassus, Julius Caesar,
and Pompey the Great --

343
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,900
they got together,
and they formed the first triumvirate.

344
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,800
They took the city back,
and they made it magnificent again.

345
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,300
Easy there, Julius.

346
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,500
The risk still doesn't match the reward.

347
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,000
I agree. I ain't doing it.
I got to take a leak.

348
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,500
Celeste, I think this is the chance for us all
to expand and build together.

349
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,700
What do you think?

350
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,100
I think forget about downtown.

351
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,400
I think there's too many problems.

352
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,000
Besides,
I don't like the company.

353
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,200
In fact, why don't I say my goodbyes now
before he gets back?

354
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,900
I doubt he even washes his hands.

355
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,900
No blown pupil.

356
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,200
- How long has he been out?
- About an hour.

357
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,700
No blood behind his eardrum.
Who is he?

358
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,600
According to this,
his name's Sam Cooper.

359
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,700
This I.D.'S from a local teen shelter.
He's a runaway.
