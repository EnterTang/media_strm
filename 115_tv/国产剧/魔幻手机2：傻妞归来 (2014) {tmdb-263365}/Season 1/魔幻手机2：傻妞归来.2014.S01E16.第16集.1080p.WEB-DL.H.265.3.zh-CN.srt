00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:06,238
(Barry)
My name is barry allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,173
When I was a child,
I saw my mother killed

3
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:09,175
By something impossible.

4
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:10,376
Run, barry, run!

5
00:00:10,378 --> 00:00:13,245
(Barry)
My father went to prison
for her murder.

6
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:17,182
Then an accident made me
the impossible.

7
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,885
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

8
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:22,921
But secretly,
I use my speed to fight crime

9
00:00:22,923 --> 00:00:24,490
And find others like me.

10
00:00:24,492 --> 00:00:27,159
And one day, I'll find
who killed my mother...

11
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:28,193
Mom!

12
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:29,595
(Barry)
And get justice for my father.

13
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:32,498
I am The Flash.

14
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,466
Previously on <i>The Flash...</i>

15
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:36,268
(Barry)
Last night, on my way
to the morgue,

16
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,737
I saw something.

17
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:40,773
Taxi!
Oh, come on!

18
00:00:40,775 --> 00:00:42,074
I'm gonna
be late!

19
00:00:42,076 --> 00:00:43,809
Simon Stagg,
remember him?

20
00:00:43,811 --> 00:00:45,677
Hasn't been seen
in, like, six months.

21
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:47,346
You're saying Wells
knows where Stagg is.

22
00:00:47,348 --> 00:00:48,981
(Mason)
No, I'm saying wells killed him.

23
00:00:48,983 --> 00:00:50,883
I have evidence in
a secure digital file

24
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:52,217
That will explain everything.

25
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:54,486
There is a Tsunami
heading for the city.

26
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:56,188
You need to get as far
away from here as possible.

27
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,392
I have not been able
to stop thinking about you.

28
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,828
Go!

29
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:08,200
Aah!

30
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,613
[gasping]

31
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:26,819
[dogs barking]

32
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:31,924
No, no...

33
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:34,593
Taxi!
Taxi!

34
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:37,563
Oh, come on!
I'm gonna be late!

35
00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:38,797
Oh, boy.

36
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,933
(Cisco)
Hey, what's going on?

37
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:43,435
- Dude?
- Yeah, Cisco.

38
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,670
I'm... Here...

39
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:47,372
What happened?
Why'd you stop?

40
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:49,475
I just got
a little disoriented.

41
00:01:49,477 --> 00:01:50,809
Well, you need to
make up some time, man.

42
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:52,544
You better hurry up.

43
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:53,812
Hurry?
What are you...

44
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:57,049
Hurry, as in
get to the morgue.

45
00:01:57,051 --> 00:02:00,352
The morgue?
I was there.

46
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:02,521
Yesterday.

47
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:03,689
What are you
talking about?

48
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:05,891
Come on, you gotta go.

49
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,132
[camera shutter clicks]

50
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:28,280
Hey, Barr.
What's with all the water?

51
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:30,215
Did the sprinkler system
go off or something?

52
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:32,951
What? No, I checked
the sprinklers.

53
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:34,586
They're all
intact.

54
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:36,822
But the water
has ice in it.

55
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:38,690
And the bruises
on the coroner

56
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,058
Aren't just on
his face.

57
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,861
Check...
Look at his torso.

58
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,633
Whoa.

59
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:48,967
How the hell
did you know that?

60
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:50,969
He was killed
by hail.

61
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:52,571
We have to listen
to the recording.

62
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:53,672
Recording?

63
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:54,840
(Thawne)
Joe, we got something.

64
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:55,974
The Coroner's office
just installed

65
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:57,843
An Automated
Dictation System.

66
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,311
Listen to this.

67
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:01,079
(Coroner)
Please... No more...

68
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:02,848
(Mardon)
I'll stop when you tell me...

69
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,116
(Coroner)
Just stop!

70
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:05,118
(Mardon)
Who killed him?

71
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:06,818
It's Mark Mardon.

72
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,086
He wants revenge.

73
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:10,289
[screams of pain on recording]

74
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,059
And I really
don't wanna go.

75
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:15,427
He's your brother,
Cisco.

76
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:16,762
Not by choice.

77
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:18,463
Okay, well, how bad can
a birthday party be?

78
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:21,867
Um, my folks think
dante's stink don't stink.

79
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,869
Doesn't matter how much
he screws up,

80
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,204
Or how many times
he gets into trouble.

81
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:27,172
In their eyes,
he can do no wrong.

82
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:29,975
And yet, they never
fail to remind me

83
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:32,711
That I can
do no right.

84
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,112
What if I came
with you?

85
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:35,380
What?
Seriously?

86
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,949
Absolutely.
You've done so much for me.

87
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:39,284
Let me be there for you
for a change.

88
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:41,320
And I could look at
old family photo albums

89
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:42,921
And see what little Cisco
looks like

90
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,823
Without long hair.

91
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:47,226
I'm rescinding
your invite.

92
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,795
Clyde Mardon has a brother?

93
00:03:49,797 --> 00:03:52,798
So, both mardon brothers
survived the plane crash

94
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,132
And then the dark matter
released

95
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:55,767
By the
particle accelerator explosion

96
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:57,202
Affects them both in...

97
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:58,537
(Barry and Wells)
Virtually the same way.

98
00:03:58,539 --> 00:03:59,972
That's right.

99
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:02,608
Only Mark's not
like Clyde at all.

100
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,509
He can do things that

101
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:06,011
You couldn't even imagine.

102
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:07,213
You mean
he's sort of like a...

103
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:09,514
(Barry and Cisco)
Weather Wizard?

104
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:11,383
Yeah.

105
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:13,418
[slurps]
Mm.

106
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,989
(Barry and Caitlyn)
Trigeminal Headache?

107
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:19,591
Mr. Allen.

108
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:22,094
A word please.

109
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:23,428
Yeah.

110
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,101
(Wells)
You ruptured the time continuum,
didn't you?

111
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:31,136
You're experiencing
temporal reversion.

112
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:32,537
- Yeah!
- How long?

113
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:34,339
Uh, a day
and some change.

114
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:35,941
It's like I'm living it
all over again.

115
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,242
Yeah, well that's good.
That means there's

116
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:39,077
Not too much you could've
messed up yet.

117
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,545
How did this happen?

118
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:41,947
I... I don't know.
I mean,

119
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,716
I was running faster than
I've ever ran,

120
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:45,884
And the first time
that I lived this day

121
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:47,019
Some really horrible
things happened.

122
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:48,020
There was a tidal wave
and...

123
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:49,655
No.
Do not tell me.

124
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:50,956
I do not want
to know anything

125
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,091
About the future
you experienced. Nothing!

126
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:54,293
Okay, but Dr. Wells,
I...

127
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:55,627
Barry.

128
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,963
Time...

129
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:00,899
Is an extremely
fragile construct.

130
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:03,669
Any deviation,
no matter how small,

131
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:05,304
Could result
in a Cataclysm.

132
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:06,905
Now here's what
you're going to do.

133
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:10,309
Everything
you did before.

134
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:11,311
Every word
you uttered,

135
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:13,145
Every step
you took,

136
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:14,479
You're going to
do again.

137
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:15,881
And you're not going
to tell anyone

138
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:19,251
This happened.

139
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:20,585
[sighs]

140
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:26,058
Good day, Dr. Wells.

141
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,926
Time will tell,
Gideon.

142
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:29,628
Show me the future.

143
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,096
(Gideon)
As you wish.

144
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:33,932
The future remains intact,
Dr. Wells.

145
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:35,667
If anything
changes,

146
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,002
Alert me
immediately.

147
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,104
(Gideon)
Of course, doctor.

148
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:46,611
[indistinct chatter]

149
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:56,221
Hey.

150
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:57,422
Hey.

151
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:58,590
What's going on
with you?

152
00:05:58,592 --> 00:05:59,891
How'd you figure
all that stuff out

153
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:01,026
At the morgue?

154
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,195
Lucky guesses,
I guess.

155
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:04,896
Look, I'm
telling you,

156
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:08,467
I'm gonna get mardon
if it kills me.

157
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:12,738
Joe, um...

158
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,106
I gotta
run an errand.

159
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:16,308
I'll see you later.
All right?

160
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:35,460
I didn't know there was
anyone else like me.

161
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,066
(Mardon)
I'm gonna break out of here!

162
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:45,537
I'm gonna create a tidal wave
that destroys your entire city!

163
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,773
(Cisco)
So, I still don't understand.

164

00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:22,499
Mick, calm down!

654
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:24,968
Mick!
We need them!

655
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:28,405
Mick?
Baby?

656
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:29,840
It sounds like
you're hungry.

657
00:28:29,842 --> 00:28:32,976
(Lisa)
How about you and I grab
some dinner?

658
00:28:32,978 --> 00:28:35,212
I like you, kid.

659
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:36,346
You're smart.

660
00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:37,348
You pulled yourself up

661
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:39,550
From humble beginnings.

662
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:42,286
You seem like
a good brother.

663
00:28:42,288 --> 00:28:43,721
You too.

664
00:28:43,723 --> 00:28:45,255
Debatable.

665
00:28:45,257 --> 00:28:46,824
You answer one question
for me,

666
00:28:46,826 --> 00:28:50,961
I'll let you
and your brother walk.

667
00:28:50,963 --> 00:28:52,096
What's the question?

668
00:28:52,098 --> 00:28:58,402
The Flash.
Who is he?

669
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:01,872
I swear... He always
wears a mask.

670
00:29:01,874 --> 00:29:02,874
Aah!

671
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:03,875
No!

672
00:29:03,876 --> 00:29:05,042
No! Stop!

673
00:29:05,044 --> 00:29:06,343
[cries in pain]

674
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:08,645
This is first degree
frost bite.

675
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:10,814
Your brother could
recover with proper treatment.

676
00:29:10,816 --> 00:29:13,751
If not, all his tendons,
blood vessels, and nerves

677
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:14,952
Will freeze.

678
00:29:14,954 --> 00:29:17,721
His fingers will need
to be amputated.

679
00:29:17,723 --> 00:29:20,924
No more concertos for
the ramon family holidays.

680
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,259
Now tell me,

681
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:25,662
Who is The Flash?

682
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:36,507
There's nothing on
the Satellite Thermography.

683
00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:38,075
You were right.
This is all my fault.

684
00:29:38,077 --> 00:29:39,109
How is this your fault?

685
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:40,144
Brave heart, Barry.

686
00:29:40,146 --> 00:29:42,479
We'll get Cisco back.

687
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:44,248
(Cisco)
I'm back.

688
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,316
(Caitlyn)
Oh, my god.
Are you okay?

689
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:48,452
We were so worried.

690
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:50,120
What happened?

691
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:51,722
How did you escape?

692
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:54,892
I didn't.

693
00:29:54,894 --> 00:29:58,562
Snart just let you go?
Why?

694
00:29:58,564 --> 00:30:02,566
He, um...
He tortured my brother.

695
00:30:02,568 --> 00:30:05,569
And he said
he was gonna kill him

696
00:30:05,571 --> 00:30:08,605
If I didn't...

697
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:10,974
If I didn't
tell him...

698
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:14,244
Tell him what?

699
00:30:14,246 --> 00:30:18,448
Who The Flash
really is.

700
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:21,118
(Cisco)
I, honestly, man, they...

701
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,621
They could've killed me.

702
00:30:24,623 --> 00:30:27,558
But they were gonna
kill my brother.

703
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,293
I couldn't let him
do that.

704
00:30:29,295 --> 00:30:31,862
[cries]

705
00:30:31,864 --> 00:30:32,763
Hey.

706
00:30:32,765 --> 00:30:33,797
I'm sorry, Barry.

707
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:36,300
- No.
- I'm so sorry.

708
00:30:36,302 --> 00:30:39,503
I put you in
that position.

709
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,742
I'm the one who's sorry.

710
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:52,616
Where are you going?

711
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:58,055
I don't deserve
to be here.

712
00:30:58,057 --> 00:31:00,958
I won't be the one
to put you in jeopardy.

713
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,393
Not again.

714
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:05,996
Never again.

715
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:16,006
Hey.

716
00:31:16,008 --> 00:31:17,307
What?

717
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:18,475
What a surprise.

718
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:19,943
- Oh.
- [chuckles]

719
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:23,480
As big a surprise as
Eddie punching barry

720
00:31:23,482 --> 00:31:24,781
At a crime scene
this evening.

721
00:31:24,783 --> 00:31:26,783
Oh, my god.
Is Barry okay?

722
00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:29,653
Yeah.
He... Heals fast.

723
00:31:29,655 --> 00:31:32,155
Look, Iris.
This got complicated.

724
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:35,726
I know.
I'm sorry.

725
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:39,463
Barry was too late.
I'm with Eddie.

726
00:31:39,465 --> 00:31:42,199
Let me ask you something.

727
00:31:42,201 --> 00:31:46,770
Who do you love?

728
00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:48,906
I mean,
I love Eddie.

729
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:51,308
Okay. You need to
make them believe that,

730
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,911
Because right now, I'm not
sure either one of them does.

731
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:55,379
Okay?

732
00:31:55,381 --> 00:31:58,949
Okay.

733
00:31:58,951 --> 00:32:01,418
Did I ever tell you
how wise and amazing you are?

734
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,753
Not enough.

735
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:07,291
See you later.

736
00:32:07,293 --> 00:32:11,161
- Bad time?
- Yes, actually.

737
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,266
[sighs]

738
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,912
Don't worry, I'll be
out of here soon.

739
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:33,550
Well, before you
shuffle off forever,

740
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:35,686
May I show you something?

741
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:46,897
I get it.
I failed.

742
00:32:46,899 --> 00:32:50,534
(Wells)
No, no, no. Now, you're an
incredibly clever guy, Cisco.

743
00:32:50,536 --> 00:32:54,604
So why don't you tell me

744
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:56,807
Why would I bring you
down here?

745
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,712
Because we all failed
that night.

746
00:33:01,714 --> 00:33:04,247
But we kept going.

747
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:06,483
We kept trying to
protect each other,

748
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:07,918
And Barry,

749
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,786
In spite of
the setbacks.

750
00:33:09,788 --> 00:33:11,588
Making a choice

751
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,156
Between two people you love,

752
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:16,093
That is the hardest dilemma
you will ever face.

753
00:33:16,095 --> 00:33:19,396
Well, you won't have to
worry about me

754
00:33:19,398 --> 00:33:20,864
Making the wrong decision again.

755
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:23,667
All you proved
today, Mr. Ramon,

756
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:25,235
Is that you're human.

757
00:33:25,237 --> 00:33:27,938
All you proved today

758
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,840
Is that you love
your brother.

759
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:34,277
And the reason that
we all want you to stay

760
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:36,980
Is that we love you too.

761
00:33:36,982 --> 00:33:40,283
Now, I am not
a parent,

762
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:43,620
But, in many ways,

763
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:45,255
You have shown me
what it's like

764
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:49,426
To have a son.

765
00:33:49,428 --> 00:33:54,297
(Caitlyn over intercom)
Guys, you should get up here.

766
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:56,299
Shall we?

767
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:01,972
The casino wasn't the target.

768
00:34:01,974 --> 00:34:03,173
Then why did he
do it?

769
00:34:03,175 --> 00:34:05,208
Casinos keep tons
of cash on hand

770
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,610
To cover their markers,
not to mention

771
00:34:06,612 --> 00:34:07,811
The money that they make.

772
00:34:07,813 --> 00:34:09,446
But if they're
under attack,

773
00:34:09,448 --> 00:34:11,681
The protocol is to relocate
the money outside the casino.

774
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:13,984
So, that was snart's plan
all along.

775
00:34:13,986 --> 00:34:16,253
- To trigger the move.
- Okay, where is it now?

776
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,794
[indistinct chatter]

777
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,868
Get ready, we got company.

778
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:53,223
Aah!

[crashes]

785
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:27,224
Good to see you...

786
00:35:27,226 --> 00:35:29,693
Barry.

787
00:35:29,695 --> 00:35:31,361
We have to talk.

788
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,236
(Barry)
I know Cisco told you who I am.

789
00:35:39,238 --> 00:35:41,972
Can't really blame
the kid for giving you up.

790
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:43,607
You or his brother?
Come on!

791
00:35:43,609 --> 00:35:45,876
I put him in
a tight spot.

792
00:35:45,878 --> 00:35:48,578
Same kind I got you in
right now.

793
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,815
Can't really stop me now
that I know who you are.

794
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:54,084
I could speed you
to my own private prison

795
00:35:54,086 --> 00:35:55,785
Where you'll never
see the light of day.

796
00:35:55,787 --> 00:35:57,220
You could, but then
I won't be around

797
00:35:57,222 --> 00:35:58,922
To stop my own
private uplink

798
00:35:58,924 --> 00:36:01,091
That'll broadcast
your identity to the world.

799
00:36:01,093 --> 00:36:04,127
So, the million dollar
question.

800
00:36:04,129 --> 00:36:06,763
What to do with me now,
Barry Allen?

801
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:08,165
I won't let you
keep stealing

802
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:10,901
Whatever you want,
whenever you feel like it.

803
00:36:10,903 --> 00:36:12,969
- It needs to end.
- Can't do that.

804
00:36:12,971 --> 00:36:14,137
It's what I do.

805
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:15,872
Then find
a new line of work.

806
00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:17,240
Don't want to.

807
00:36:17,242 --> 00:36:18,441
Why is that?

808
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:21,111
The same reason you keep
running after guys like me.

809
00:36:21,113 --> 00:36:23,914
The adrenaline.
The thrill of the chase.

810
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:25,582
I love this game.

811
00:36:25,584 --> 00:36:27,884
And I'm very
good at it.

812
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:30,020
Then go play it
somewhere else.

813
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:31,121
Leave Central City.

814
00:36:31,123 --> 00:36:32,756
Can't do that either.

815
00:36:32,758 --> 00:36:33,758
I love it here.

816
00:36:33,759 --> 00:36:34,759
[inhales]
