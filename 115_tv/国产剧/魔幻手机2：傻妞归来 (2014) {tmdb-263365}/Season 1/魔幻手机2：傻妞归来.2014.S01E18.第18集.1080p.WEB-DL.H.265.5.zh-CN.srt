6
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,170
My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive.

7
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,050
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed

8
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,490
by something impossible.

9
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:10,180
Run, Barry, run!

10
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,770
My father went to prison for her murder.

11
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,990
Then an accident made me the impossible.

12
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,830
To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

13
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,770
but secretly, I use my speed to fight crime

14
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,280
and find others like me.

15
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:27,190
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother...

16
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,300
Mom! And get justice for my father.

17
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,600
I am The Flash.

18
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,280
Previously on The Flash...

19
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,540
If you ever need anything,

20
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,660
I will race over in a heartbeat.

21
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,410
Same. Well, as fast as I can run.

22
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,390
Advanced Technology Operating Mechanism--A.T.O.M.

23
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,510
What are you gonna use it for?

24
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,040
To protect the people of this city.

25
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,340
You think Dr. Wells killed Barry's mom?

26
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,070
I don't know yet.

27
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,450
But I do know that Wells keeps secrets.

28
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,850
The way that he described running--

29
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,510
feeling the wind and the power--

30
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,140
it's like he was talking from experience.

31
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:01,750
Harrison Wells is The Reverse-Flash.

32
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,460
Eddie, we need your help.

33
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,360
Pedal to the metal.

34
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,750
We've got a 10-31 in progress.

35
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,240
Shiny Diamond, 18th and Olive.

36
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,330
That's only a few blocks from here.

37
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,610
Has every crook in Central City gone crazy?

38
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,790
This is the third attempted robbery tonight.

39
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,850
Barry. We got another one.

40
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,810
Hello.

41
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,170
18th and Olive.

42
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,130
Got it.

43
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:40,680
Who's this?

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,720
Oh. Indecent exposure. Powell Park.

45
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,240
That ain't something you should be showing people.

46
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,650
They're getting away, guys.

47
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,030
They're not getting away, Eddie.

48
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,550
Let's get these bozos up ahead of us first,

49
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,150
and then we'll worry about the idiots at the Shiny Diamond.

50
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,960
All right.

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,500
We're gonna run out of room, though.

52
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,620
I'll take care of that.

53
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,960
What do you think he meant by that?

54
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,050
Oh. That's what he meant.

55
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,690
I think we lost them.

56
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,460
Oh, no, you didn't.

57
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,730
And by the way, you're under arrest.

58
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,460
We need to go. Now. Come on!

59
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,050
Uh-uh. Freeze.

60
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,450
You guys missing these?

61
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,350
On the ground. On the ground.

62
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,720
So, uh, I'm just curious, but...

63
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,940
have you guys not heard of me, or what?

64
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,930
Nice work, detective.

65
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,600
- Good night, Dr. Kang. - Good night.

68
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,740
Victim's name is Lindsay Kang,

69
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,430
engineering professor at Hudson University.

70
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,730
Just got tenure.

71
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,280
So, her whole body's covered in these puncture wounds

72
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,560
you see on her face.

73
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,050
Bite marks maybe.

74
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,270
Whatever it was, she must have gone into anaphylaxis.

75
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,710
- Damn. - Yeah.

76
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,220
The blood sample should tell us

77
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,130
everything we need to know.

78
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,750
I'll run tests back at my lab.

79
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,440
They can do it faster at S.T.A.R. Labs.

80
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,650
Well, yeah, but, I mean, it's just...

81
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,390
It's just what?

82
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,470
It's kind of weird being there right now.

83
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,090
Barry, you know we have to play it cool with Wells.

84
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,410
If he finds out we suspect him--

85
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,490
I know. I get it.

86
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,150
I just think that we should tell Cisco and Caitlin.

87
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,300
They could help us.

88
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,640
The more people who know, the more chance

89
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,500
Wells is gonna find out we're on to him.

90
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,310
I mean, what if one of them slips up?

91
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,600
Or panics?

92
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,060
- Or what if... - What?

93
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,120
What if they're not on our side?

94
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,820
No. Absolutely not.

95
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,870
They're not involved in whatever he's planning.

96
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,490
I mean, Wells is their boss, their mentor.

97
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:24,600
They've been with him for a long time.

98
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,790
I've seen plenty of people make the wrong choice for loyalty.

99
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,510
Please do not include them until we can be sure.

100
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,700
All right.

101
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,890
Death by apitoxin.

102
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,740
Honeybee venom.

103
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,520
Bees. Why did it have to be bees?

104
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,240
Y'all, I don't do bees.

105
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,740
Ain't nobody got time for bees.

106
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,310
But when a honeybee stings,

107
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,290
the stingers are literally torn from their abdomen,

108
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,350
and they die.

109
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,940
But there were no stingers in the body

110
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,360
and no dead bees in the car.

111
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:04,640
A honeybee can only deposit 0.1 milligrams of apitoxin

112
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,980
when it releases its stinger.

114
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,390
And yet, Ms. Kang was found

115
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,560
with enough venom in her system to kill a herd of elephants.

116
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,560
It appears not only is a meta-human controlling these bees

117
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,990
but also increasing their toxicity.

118
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,820
Bees communicate by releasing pheromones.

119
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,950
Maybe this meta's controlling them through secretion?

120
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,650
Anyone want to join me in getting a beekeeper suit?

121
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,400
I'm pretty sure I can outrun a bee.

122
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,060
Just don't run into a lake.

123
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,310
Bees will wait for you to come up for air

124
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,670
and then they'll sting you.

125
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:33,020
Discovery Channel. Turns out there's a lot to discover.

126
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,860
Felicity, what are you doing here?

127
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,420
Can you guys come outside for a sec?

128
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,420
What exactly are we waiting for, Ms. Smoak?

129
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,620
Up there.

130
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,690
Is that a bird?

131
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,580
It's a plane.

132
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,860
It's my boyfriend.

133
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,820
Hi. I'm Ray.

134
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:23,510
So he seems a little tall for you.

135
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,810
Barry Allen, are you jealous?

136
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,170
Je... no. No, I'm not jealous.

137
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,870
I just-- I really wish you would've called

138
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:31,820
before flying in.

139
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,160
Oh no, He flied, I drove.

140
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,070
I'm serious, all right?

141
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,180
Now is not the best time.

142
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,510
Why? What's going on?

143
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,450
Well, my ears popped, so that's something.

144
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,430
You're lucky you didn't break your neck.

145
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,950
What is it with billionaires being superheroes?

146
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,920
So have you... picked a name yet?

147
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,540
I'm kind of partial to The Atom.

148
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,020
You married to that, or...?

149
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,510
Your A.T.O.M. Suit...

150
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,900
it's quite the technological achievement, Mr. Palmer.

151
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,560
I'm impressed.

152
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,970
And he is never impressed.

153
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:07,870
Well, thank you,

154
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:11,030
but I can't quite seem to keep it up.

155
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,570
He means the suit.

156
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,270
- Yeah, I mean the suit. - Yeah.

157
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,840
I can attest that everything else works just fine.

158
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,330
There's nothing we need to fix in...

159
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,240
that area.

160
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,480
No, no, no. The sex is great.

161
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,750
God, there's two of them.

162
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,140
I know from Felicity that you have been very helpful

163
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,820
with Barry and the Flash suit,

164
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,560
and I was hoping to get another set of eyes on my...

165
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,350
- Problem. - Problem.

166
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,520
Any friend of The Arrow's is a friend--

167
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,150
- Hell, yes. - Guys.

168
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,390
We kind of have a lot going on already.

169
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,730
There's the meta-human killer

170
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,280
that can control a whole swarm of bees?

171
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,140
Cool.

172
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,630
I mean, awful.

173
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,160
I'm sure Caitlin and I

174
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,900
will provide ample support, Barry.

175
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,570
And I will be happy to sit this one out.

176
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,410
You...

177
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,050
Ray, why don't you stay here and work on your suit

178
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,040
while Barry and I run to Jitters for some java?

179
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,480
Sounds like a plan.

180
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,700
- Coffee? - Sure.

182
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:18,200
- Hey, Detective. - Iris.

183
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,480
What are you doing here?

184
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,150
I am following up on my story

185
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,670
about crime in Central City.

186
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,670
Or lack thereof.

187
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,780
Could someone be working with The Flash?

188
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,580
No. Of course not.

189
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,000
You caught a flasher,

190
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,300
armed robbers in a getaway car,

191
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,370
and two jewelry thieves last night.

192
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,390
I'm just that good.

193
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,110
What is going on with you lately?

194
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:43,210
You've been acting really weird and withdrawn.

195
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,850
If I didn't know any better,

196
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,070
I'd think that you were hiding something from me.

197
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,640
Iris, I'm-- I'm not hiding anything from you.

198
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,470
Do you ever go to work?

199
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,740
Oh, you're funny.

200
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:07,140
Okay, I can't keep lying to Iris about The Flash.

201
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,720
You have to.

202
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,790
It's really starting to affect our relationship.

203
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,270
We haven't had sex in two weeks.

204
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,570
Which you didn't want to know about.

205
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:21,330
Keeping her in the dark keeps her safe.

206
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,340
I don't agree.

207
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,400
Well, I'm her father.

208
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,550
And I'm her boyfriend.

209
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,940
When does my vote outweigh yours?

210
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,000
When you become her husband.

211
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,380
You know I left Starling City

212
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,880
to get away from the mood and brood,

213
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:44,230
but it looks like it followed me here.

214
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,240
I know. I'm sorry.

215
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,990
It's like I said before,

216
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,470
now is not the best time.

217
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:52,050
Barry, I have been through enough with you

218
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,770
to know when you're holding something back.

219
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:55,960
Is this because I told Ray your secret?

220
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,530
Because he is trustworthy, Barry.

221
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,100
He wants to help people, just like you.

222
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,720
I know, that's not what I'm worried about.

223
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,590
It's...

224
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,190
I really don't want to put anyone else in danger.

225
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,260
In danger of what?

226
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,790
Barry, hey.

227
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,840
Eddie, hey.

228
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,970
- You remember Felicity. - Of course.

229
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:15,910
Great to see you.

230
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:16,740
Yeah.

231
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,790
What is wrong with you?

232
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,870
Is everyone in Central City in a bad mood?

233
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,270
I thought Central City was supposed to be the fun one.

234
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,090
It's...

235
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,170
- It's not... - Felicity knows.

236
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,170
So everyone but Iris.

237
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,170
It feels that way.

238
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,660
How do you lie to everyone you care about?

239
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,740
For starters,

240
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,510
don't think of it as lying.

241
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,550
Think of it as protecting her from getting hurt...

242
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,590
with a fib.

243
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,860
But Iris can tell I'm hiding something,

244
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,580
and it's putting this distance between us.

245
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:49,940
I have an idea.

246
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,420
Why don't we all go to dinner tonight?

247
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,630
A little wine and dine is sure to bridge the gap.

248
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,410
Come on, we all had fun last time.

249
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,790
Sure. Why not?

250
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,830
Barry Allen, fifth wheel.

252
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,990
Well, I can't make my 3:00 meeting this afternoon.

253
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,520
also, confirm my dinner reservation for tonight.

254
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,260
Last time, they couldn't find it,

255
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,060
and that was unacceptable. Thanks.

256
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,540
You see that bad man over there?

257
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,590
Tell your sisters it's time.

258
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,130
So you put solid oxide fuel cells into the belt?

259
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,920
Yeah, it's the only place to hide the hardware.

260
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,300
Well, they should be generating enough energy

261
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,680
to power the suit.

262
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,890
It could be the operating temperature.

263
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,390
I mean, you're essentially--

264
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,560
Overheating the system, yeah. I figured.

265
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:40,480
But if we insulate them

266
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,220
with a ceramic compound...

267
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,140
We may improve the operating efficiency.

268
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,220
You really are quite clever, Cisco.

269
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,100
Some would say I'm the reverse.

270
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,950
You're incredibly clever, Cisco.

271
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,450
How do you turn this thing on?

272
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,620
Cisco? You okay?

273
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,530
Yeah.

274
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:10,100
I haven't been getting enough sleep...

275
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,760
Cisco, we need you up here.

276
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,730
Killer bees are at it again.

277
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:22,790
Get a hold of Barry.

278
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,430
Another bee attack. Folston Tech.

279
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,140
I'll see where Joe is.

280
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,080
- Bee careful. - For real?

281
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,760
Bad pun. Sorry. Just don't die.

283
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,980
I'm too late.

284
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,070
Where are the bees?

285
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,410
I don't know. There's no sign of them.

286
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,740
Found them.

287
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,330
How do I get out of here?

288
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,490
Take the northeast crossway.

289
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,830
It's the quickest way out of the building.

290
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,650
Guys, they're everywhere. I'm surrounded.

291
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,480
Barry!

292
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:40,910
Barry.

293
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,090
He's going into cardiac arrest.

294
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:46,900
Barry, stay with me.

296
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,070
Cisco! Barry doesn't have a pulse.

297
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,290
- Step away from him. - What? Why?

298
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,300
We need to jumpstart his heart.

299
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,930
There's a defibrillator in the suit.

300
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,580
Charge it to 360 joules.

301
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,190
Charging in three, two, one.

302
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,700
Hit him again. 400 joules.

303
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,850
Charging in three, two, one.

304
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:26,770
Barry.

305
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,260
Joe.

306
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,360
That is it for the defibrillator.

307
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,460
It is completely fried.

308
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,100
You're lucky to be alive, Mr. Allen.

309
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,140
I was very specific that you not die.

310
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,880
Yeah, that's a pretty big thing for her.

311
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,270
Cisco, what happened out there?

312
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:54,070
I followed your directions exactly.

313
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,390
I'm sorry. I led you the wrong way.

314
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,420
The schematics that we had,

315
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,280
they... they weren't up to date.

316
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,010
What, they weren't up to date?

317
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:02,530
What do you mean?

318
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:03,980
That's never happened before.

319
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,270
What, you think Cisco was trying to get you killed?

320
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,490
No. Why would he do that?

321
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,470
That doesn't make any sense.

322
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,720
I know. That's why I was joking.

323
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,650
Barry, it's our job to protect you,

324
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,330
and today, we failed,

325
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,760
but that'll just serve as a warning

326
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,260
for all of us to be more vigilant in the future.

327
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,370
Good news -- the apitoxin is out of your body.

328
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,850
Your levels are back to normal.

329
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,290
Terrific.

330
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:28,060
Ray, Felicity. We're gonna be late for dinner.

331
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,150
Are you sure that's wise, Barry?

332
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,390
You just died.

333
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,070
Maybe you should order in tonight.

334
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,690
Yeah, we could totally cancel.

335
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:37,460
I'm fine. Alive. Hungry.

336
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,680
All right? Let's go.

337
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,300
That was weird.

338
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,540
Yeah. Why didn't we get invited to dinner?

339
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:56,450
Thank you.

340
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,390
Hey, guys.

341
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,590
Wow, Iris. Check you out.

342
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,360
Hi, Felicity.

343
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,310
Hello.

344
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,650
Guys, this is Ray Palmer.

345
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:07,580
Nice to meet you.

346
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,290
Lovely to meet you.

347
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:09,980
- Nice to meet you. - Barry.

348
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,950
Bienvenue chez Massimo Restaurant.

349
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,830
Mr. Palmer, your table is ready.

350
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,110
Great. Shall we?

351
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,170
Yes.

352
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,790
Hey, how did he get a reservation here?

353
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,360
We've been trying for months.

354
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,390
I don't know.

355
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,230
Here's your table, sir.

356
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,800
I thought it'd be nice if it was quiet,

357
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,260
so I bought out the entire restaurant.

358
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,100
Too much?

359
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,850
Just a tad, sweetie.

360
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,170
Joe.

361
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,700
Oh, Cisco.

362
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,240
You just saved me a trip to S.T.A.R. Labs.

363
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,610
I got some info on our second victim.

364
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,230
Name's Bill Carlisle.

365
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,080
He was recently hired at Folston Tech

367
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,950
to beef up their Robotics Division.

368
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,100
Robotics?

369
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,850
That's just like the first victim.

370
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,770
That is weird.

371
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,940
That's not why you stopped by.

372
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,460
No, I wanted to talk to you about Barry.

373
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,610
Okay.

374
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,850
Is there something going on with him?

375
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,650
Something he's not telling us?

376
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,470
What do you mean?

377
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,910
He hasn't really been himself lately.

378
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,450
Not that I'm aware of.

379
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:39,630
It's like something is just really bothering him.

380
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,450
Well, I think he's got his mind trained on

381
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,020
catching the bad guys, Cisco.

382
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:49,310
And he's probably worried about

383
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,940
when The Reverse-Flash is gonna show his face again.

384
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:55,110
Oh, I'm not like The Flash at all.

385
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,150
Some would say I'm the reverse.

386
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:05,810
You okay?

387
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,640
Yeah. Yeah, no, I'm fine.

388
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:10,950
It's just--I've got this crazy headache.

389
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:14,300
Thank you for the file and the talk.

390
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,340
So how did you two meet?

391
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:24,520
Work.

392
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,740
Well, actually,

393
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,850
I bought the company where Felicity was employed,

394
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:30,430
and so she was forced to join me at Palmer Tech.

395
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,030
It's not as creepy as it sounds.

396
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,850
So you two work closely together?

397
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,530
Interesting.

398
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,740
I guess you guys share all of your thoughts

399
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:41,250
and feelings and...

400
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,390
Yeah... I share everything with Felicity.

401
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,330
It's nice that you guys have that level of communication.

402
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,400
Oh, well, no, not every-everything.

403
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,440
I mean, sometimes it's good to just shut up.

404
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,370
I get that.

405
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,320
Some things are better left unspoken.

406
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,410
Really?

407
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,320
I-I don't find that to be true.

408
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:08,960
Oh, thank God. It's the food.

409
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,610
Food's here.

410
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,890
Our first course on the tasting menu

411
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,840
is a quail egg frittata.

412
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,010
Bon appetit.

413
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,000
Barry.

414
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:18,840
I got to admit,

415
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,350
I envy you spending so much time at S.T.A.R. Labs.

416
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:23,880
Harrison Wells is, like, a personal hero of mine.

417
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,070
I mean, it's amazing just to actually

418
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,450
be in the same room with him.

419
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:35,080
I'll be right back. Just excuse me.

420
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,900
Okay.

421
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,780
Well, I, um...

422
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,230
have to pee.

423
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,910
Okay, you've been acting super strange

424
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,420
ever since Ray and I got to Central City.

425
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,720
What is going on with you?

426
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,320
And don't say it's a bad time.

427
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,770
Oliver might be joining the League of Assassins,

428
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:02,580
Laurel's the Black Canary,

429
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,460
and Thea's training with Malcolm,

430
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,810
so I know about bad times.

431
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:06,820
Okay.

432
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,550
Joe and I found out that Wells isn't who he says he is.

433
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,600
He...

434
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:25,000
He is the man that killed my mother.

435
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,190
Oh, my God. But he's been helping you.

436
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,680
Get faster, stronger. I know.

437
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,170
- Why? - I don't know.

438
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,340
I don't know anything anymore,

439
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,570
especially who I can and can't trust.

440
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,360
So you think Cisco and Caitlin are helping him?

441
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,580
That's impossible.

442
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:39,930
Is it?

443
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,410
Yes. They were trying to save you today, Barry.

444
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,210
They did save you.

445
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,450
Wells has also saved me.

446
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,490
Many times.

447
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:47,900
I thought that Wells was a great man,

448
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,840
and I was so wrong about him.

449
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,010
What if I'm wrong about everything else too?

450
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,220
Hey, guys.

451
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,370
Uh, things are getting a little intense in here.

452
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,960
Please can't we just have a nice evening?

453
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,050
Okay, so it's my fault

454
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,730
that we're not having a nice evening?

455
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,580
I am your girlfriend. Who you live with.

456
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:13,000
I shouldn't have to beg you to talk to me.

457
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,380
If I could talk to you about this, I would, believe me.

458
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,690
But I can't.

459
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,860
You know what? I am not hungry anymore.

460
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,370
- Iris. - You know what?

461
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:24,620
When you are ready to act like

462
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,330
we are two people who love each other,

463
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,160
call me.

464
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,710
I'll be at my dad's.

465
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,970
Thank you for dinner. I've got to go.

466
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:42,740
Uh, emergency at S.T.A.R. Labs.

467
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,640
Go.

468
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,500
Sorry.

469
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,870
Well, only 17 more courses to go.

470
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:55,940
Containment breach. Foreign object detected.

471
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:00,200
Did I get it?

472
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,190
I think I got it.

473
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,080
Where is he?

474
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:14,970
Thank you.

475
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:18,090
Let's see what makes this bee so poisonous.

476
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,420
You saved my life.

477
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,990
That is one odd-looking bee.

478
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:31,430
That's 'cause it isn't a bee at all.

479
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,410
It's a robot.

480
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,040
No way.

481
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,210
Unbelievable.

482
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:11,670
This bot's got a 360-degree vision system.

483
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,800
I mean, we're talking multiple micro-cameras

484
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,840
all coming from various angles at the same time.

485
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:18,740
Which means...

486
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,930
It can see all around the room at once.

487
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:21,680
That is...

488
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,900
Amazing.

489
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:24,390
Disturbing.

490
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:27,090
It's also next-gen hardware that'nowhere near the market.

491
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,900
So we're not dealing with a meta-human?

492
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,450
It's just a mad scientist.

493
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,950
Cisco, you said the second victim,

494
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,860
Bill Carlisle, was a robotics engineer.

495
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,640
Let's cross-reference his previous employers

496
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,580
with those of Lindsay Kang.

497
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,430
Allow me.

498
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,150
Mama's been away from a keyboard for far too long.

499
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:41,540
Okay.

501
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,150
They both worked at Mercury Labs.

502
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,690
Let's call Joe.

503
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,750
I think it's time we paid a visit to an old friend.

504
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,620
Twice in one year, Harrison.

505
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:59,830
You really are vying for comeback scientist of the year.

506
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,500
Always a pleasure, Christina.

507
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,850
To what do I owe this visit?

508
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,820
Did you finally find my tachyon prototype,

509
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,960
or are you here to blackmail me for another one?

510
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,320
Do you have another one?

511
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,620
We came here for information.

512
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,810
Bill Carlisle and Lindsay Kang.

513
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,450
Former employees who were recently murdered.

514
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,680
My God. I wasn't aware.

515
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:24,160
Stung to death by robotic bees.

516
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,890
You're looking for Brie Larvan.

517
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,170
Brie Larvan?

518
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,460
A quite brilliant roboticist who once developed

519
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:33,510
miniature mechanical bees for agricultural use.

520
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,940
Kang and Carlisle warned me

521
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,420
that Brie was weaponizing the bees for military use,

522
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,900
so I terminated her.

523
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,650
Well, it seems that you would

524
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,660
be on her hit list too, Doctor.

525
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,520
You've got to let us keep you safe.

526
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,110
I'm all too familiar

527
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,820
with your inability to protect things, Harrison.

528
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,970
I can take care of myself.

529
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:53,610
Good day, gentlemen.

530
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,680
Thank you.

531
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,250
Okay, so we found our queen bee.

532
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,400
Brie Larvan. She's a roboticist.

533
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,020
Joe is running a trace on her current location,

534
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,200
but so far nothing.

535
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:16,200
Good.

536
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,850
Where is Ray?

537
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:20,080
Oh, he's working on his suit with Cisco.

538
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,000
I like Ray.

539
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,310
He seems like he's a really good guy.

540
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,210
He is a good guy.

541
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,280
Just like Cisco.

542
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:29,800
And Caitlin. Girl.

543
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,670
Is that why you called me here?

544
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:38,480
I know that you're in a tricky situation,

545
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,050
but that's when you need your friends to have your back.

546
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:42,610
And how can they if you won't let them?

547
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:43,870
It's not that simple.

548
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:44,940
What if Joe is right,

549
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,440
and I tell them, and it backfires?

550
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,730
Wells isn't just their boss, Felicity.

551
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:52,380
He is their mentor, their hero.

552
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,830
My hero.

553
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:57,090
Look, it's...

554
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:00,490
I don't know what to do.

555
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,470
When I first met Oliver,

556
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,730
before I knew he was The Arrow,

557
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:11,860
he would--he would ask me to do weird things for him,

558
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,870
like decrypt a bullet-ridden computer,

559
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,280
or hack some company.

560
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:18,110
And when I would ask him why,

561
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:21,240
he would come up these ridiculous excuses.

562
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,620
And I always knew he was lying,

563
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,440
but I would help him anyway.

564
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:25,620
You know why?

565
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:30,510
Because I knew Oliver was a good person with a good heart.

566
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,960
And Cisco and Caitlin?

567
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,260
They're no different.

568
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,810
So you're really staying here tonight?

569
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,440
Tonight. Tomorrow night.

570
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,610
The night after that.

571
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,530
Do you think that Eddie is cheating on me?

572
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,610
No. Eddie's not that kind of guy.

573
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,640
Well, then I don't know what else

574
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,150
he could be hiding from me.

575
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,110
Iris...

576
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,460
Remember when we were kids,

577
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:27,160
and Joe would come home from work

578
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:31,170
with that blank expression on his face?

579
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,700
Yeah.

580
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,180
The "Earth to Joe" Look.

581
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,570
How could I forget?

582
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,290
I never understood that look

583
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:40,250
until I started workg for the CCPD.

584
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:46,320
Showing up at crime scenes and seeing someone murdered--

585
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,870
it can be ugly work.

586
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:51,450
And I'm lucky.

587
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,450
I get to hide behind the science of it

588
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:54,940
and just stay in my lab,

589
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,830
but Eddie,

590
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:01,700
he's out there every day in the darkness.

591
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:05,360
I just--I think that maybe

592
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,390
if he doesn't want to talk to you about his work,

593
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,910
it's probably because he wants to keep you in the light.

594
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:16,170
What?

595
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:22,550
I'm just surprised.

596
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,730
You going out of your way like this

597
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,650
to help me see Eddie's point of view.

598
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,450
I mean...

599
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,870
Eddie makes you happy.

600
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,240
All I ever want is for you to be happy, Iris.

601
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,580
Welcome home.

602
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:55,150
It is so fun to watch grown men play with their toys.

603
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:55,690
You're so lucky.

604
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:59,740
Ray is so nice and smart and hot.

605
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,700
Yeah, it's kind of like I'm dating Barry

606
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,930
but in Oliver's body.

607
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:07,070
A sentence you will never repeat to anyone.

608
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,760
Your secret's safe with me.

609
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,010
It must have re-activated.

610
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,420
And if it's being controlled wirelessly...

611
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,750
I can trace its signal and figure out

612
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,970
where it's trying to go.

614
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,770
- Oh, no. - Oh, boy.

615
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:22,570
What?

616
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,910
The swarm is headed for Mercury Labs.

617
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,880
Brie Larvan's going after Tina.

618
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,710
Hello, Dr. McGee.

619
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:46,220
You gonna open the window, or should I buzz myself in?

620
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,210
How do we stop them?

621
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,960
She's got to be remotely piloting

622
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,190
those bees from somewhere.

623
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:02,930
We need to stop this bug-eyed glasses woman.

624
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,340
And her mini bandits.

625
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,660
Bug-Eyed Bandit.

626
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,450
Got her. She's in an abandoned greenhouse.

627
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:09,650
Barry, you have to take out Brie.

628
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:11,250
It's the only way to stop these nano drones.

629
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,260
What about Dr. McGee?

630
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,340
The defibrillator in your suit is broken.

631
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,840
You cannot risk going near Mercury Labs.

632
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,860
Bees can't penetrate my suit.

633
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,600
I'll go.

634
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,280
We haven't tested out the new power system yet.

635
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,810
We'll do it now.

636
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:29,420
- I'm following you. - I'm driving.

637
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,220
And I'm kissing you.

638
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,700
Dr. Wells...

639
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:37,880
Mr. Palmer will protect Tina. Go.

640
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:56,590
You fired me, destroyed years of my research.

641
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:58,770
You took everything from me.

642
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:00,570
What you were doing was wrong.

643
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:03,460
You wanted to harm people, not help them.

644
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,560
I did what I had to do.

645
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,760
You mean ruin my life?

646
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:08,760
Sure.

647
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,550
Now I'm doing what I have to do.

649
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:19,790
Found her.

650
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,990
Felicity, can you jam their frequency?

651
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:24,340
I already tried, but I might be able to redirect them

652
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,640
onto a new target.

653
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,270
Ray, get ready for incoming.

654
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,840
We have the technology.

656
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:59,040
It's over, Brie.

657
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:03,060
I know you're trying to kill Dr. McGee.

658
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:04,990
You think that she betrayed you.

659
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,310
I can imagine how that feels.

660
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:11,350
You think you understand the sting of betrayal?

661
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,820
I'll show you what it means to be stung.

662
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:28,100
Barry.

663
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:41,910
Barry, I hacked into the bees' frequency.

664
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:42,920
I'm controlling them.

665
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,610
I'm the queen of this hive.

666
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,440
Oh, she's good.

667
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,170
She's like my nemesis.

668
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,490
I've never had a nemesis before.

669
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:52,830
I kind of like it.

670
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,630
Okay, Cisco. Now what?

671
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:59,050
Ray, get to the ocean.

672
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:00,460
If the bots follow you into the water,

673
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,060
their electronics will fry.

674
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:02,820
Got it.

675
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:05,040
Wait. But so will my suit.

676
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,320
Cisco, I'm fried.

677
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,550
I'm losing propulsion control.

678
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,300
Can you see the van?

679
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,020
Yeah.

680
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:30,580
We'll catch you.

681
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,140
- You will? - We will?

682
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:34,220
We will.

683
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:36,790
All right.

684
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,620
Keep it steady.

685
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:50,530
The Atom lives.

686
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:57,750
Let's work on some softer gloves for next time, okay?

687
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:58,990
Sorry.

688
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,310
Oh, you want to bring it?

689
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,570
It's been brought.

690
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,500
Rude.

691
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:09,630
Felicity, right now

692
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,530
would be a good time to do something.

693
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,250
Stay away from Barry Allen.

694
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,050
- Felicity! - Got it.

695
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,530
Boom. Drop the mic.

696
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,990
It's metaphorical, of course,

697
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:31,550
because I don't have a real mic.

698
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,170
Brie's restrained.

699
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:38,590
Call CCPD.

700
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,410
Some kind of team you have here.

701
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:46,070
Helps to have friends in your corner.

702
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,250
Are you okay?

703
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,080
Cisco!

704
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,610
Come on. Please.

705
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,490
Wake up.

706
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,020
Cisco's been stung. He's going into shock.

707
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,330
I'm on my way.

708
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,680
Come on, stay with me.

709
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,270
Hold on. Back up.

710
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:28,810
I'm gonna try something.

711
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,720
Cisco.

712
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:49,690
Either my fear of bees is over or it just got a lot worse.

713
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,580
Thank God you're okay.

714
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:54,940
I've never had anybody take a bee for me.

715
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,060
- Thank you. - You're welcome, bro.

716
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:01,070
Cisco, you're a hero, man.

717
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,760
- Dr. McGee. - May I come in?

718
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,950
Yeah, of course. What can I do for you?

719
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,490
I wanted to apologize.

720
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,360
I should have listened to you when you warned me about Brie.

721
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,060
Perhaps next time I will take the CCPD's offer of protection.

722
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,600
After we lost your tachyon prototype,

723
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,770
I can understand why you were hesitant to trust us.

724
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:36,140
Thank you.

725
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:38,750
Can I ask you something?

726
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,510
I couldn't help but notice some tension

727
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,570
between you and Dr. Wells.

728
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:49,220
That's all in the past.

729
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:52,220
Do you mind if I ask what happened between you two?

730
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:57,180
I ask myself that same question all the time.

731
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,690
15 years ago, Harrison and I were thick as thieves.

732
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:04,720
We were promising young scientists in Starling City.

733
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,430
He was such a kind man.

734
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,690
Then everything changed after Tess died.

735
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,500
They were gonna get married?

736
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,380
I understand how grief can affect someone,

737
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,790
but this was more than that.

738
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:18,460
It was like, after that day,

739
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,960
Harrison Wells became a completely different person.

740
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:24,530
Good day.

741
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:25,920
Bye.

742
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:28,790
Doctor.

743
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:31,790
How's Cisco?

744
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,860
Happy to be alive.

745
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:38,070
And sad that Ray is leaving.

746
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:43,580
It was a really brave thing he did, risking his life.

747
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:44,940
Selfless.

748
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:47,590
Yeah. It definitely was.

749
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:58,310
And another end to another exciting adventure in Central City.

750
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:00,050
Yes, thank you.

751
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,930
Ray, thank you for all your help.

752
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,510
And I hope you figure out the problem with your suit.

753
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,900
I already have, actually.

754
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,030
All this time, I've been looking at

755
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,280
the power source the wrong way.

756
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,100
I kept thinking we needed to go bigger.

757
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,770
But the solution, as always,

758
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:16,310
is simply to go smaller.

759
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:18,650
Great.

760
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,070
You okay?

761
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:23,880
I'm gonna be.

762
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:25,760
Thank you for your advice.

763
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:28,000
I won't even charge you the 5 cents.

764
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,220
Bye, Felicity.

765
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,490
Bye, Barry.

766
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:48,820
What's up?

767
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,320
I...

768
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,390
I spoke to Barry last night.

769
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:56,880
Oh, yeah?

770
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,620
He was trying to help me understand

771
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:01,200
why you've been so off lately,

772
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:04,210
why you might be having trouble connecting with me.

773
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:06,050
Really?

774
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,320
What did he say?

775
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,980
It was a good explanation.

776
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,430
Valid.

777
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,990
But the truth is, it doesn't matter,

778
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:18,460
because when you love someone,

779
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,280
you tell them everything.

780
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:22,980
So if you love me, Eddie,

781
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:26,360
you'll tell me what is going on with you, or...

782
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,350
Or what?

783
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,040
You know what.

784
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,830
All right, all right, who's ready for some...

785
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:07,700
karaoke.

786
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,020
We are not going to karaoke, are we?

787
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,670
No.

788
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:22,860
This is everything we know about my mother's murder

789
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,710
and The Reverse-Flash.

790
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:29,500
I've been gathering information on him for a long time.

791
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:35,000
And this is everything we know about Dr. Wells.

792
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:43,150
I don't understand.

793
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:45,990
What do Dr. Wells and The Reverse-Flash

794
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,340
have to do with each other?

795
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,130
They're the same person.

796
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:55,730
That's impossible.

797
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,220
Look, Caitlin,

798
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:02,000
it took me a long time to believe it too,

799
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,850
but it's him.

800
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,540
Dr. Wells is a speedster?

801
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,670
He's paralyzed.

802
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,440
Is he, though?

803
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:14,700
And why would he kill Barry's mother?

804
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,450
It doesn't make any sense.

805
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,220
Cisco. Say something.

806
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:27,250
I've been having these dreams.

807
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:31,550
Mostly at night, but sometimes during the day.

808
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,380
But they don't really feel like dreams.

809
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:38,930
They... they feel real.

810
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,390
What happens in the dream?

811
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:47,940
Dr. Wells is The Reverse-Flash.

812
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,230
And...

813
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,370
he kills me.
