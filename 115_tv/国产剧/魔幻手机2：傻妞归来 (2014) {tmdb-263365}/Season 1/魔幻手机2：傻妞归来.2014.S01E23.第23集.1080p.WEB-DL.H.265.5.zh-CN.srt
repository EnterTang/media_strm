DEMICHELE: Hi, I'm Dan from the IBM
Enterprise Marketing Management Group.

3
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:15,896
Today's marketers are tasked with sifting
through an unprecedented amount of data

4
00:00:15,946 --> 00:00:19,746
to better understand their customers and
in turn deliver a superior experience

5
00:00:20,016 --> 00:00:21,726
and favorable return back to the business.

6
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:25,516
Nowhere is information overload more
prevalent than in the digital domain.

7
00:00:26,106 --> 00:00:30,556
The IBM Enterprise Marketing Management Suite
helps marketers navigate these challenges via

8
00:00:30,556 --> 00:00:32,856
its Digital Marketing Optimization Solution.

9
00:00:33,526 --> 00:00:36,666
With these capabilities, marketers
can finally understand the what,

10
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:42,896
when and where of customer behavior; measure
the impact of digital marketing efforts; and,

11
00:00:42,896 --> 00:00:45,206
optimize or retarget based on those insights.

12
00:00:46,056 --> 00:00:50,166
Let's see how a digital marketer will use the
IBM Digital Marketing Optimization solution

13
00:00:50,556 --> 00:00:55,936
to tame the digital information firehose with
powerful marketing tools for engaging customers

14
00:00:55,936 --> 00:00:59,096
across channels and seeking
out better online conversions.

15
00:01:00,046 --> 00:01:03,286
Our marketer's first challenge is
familiar to most organizations.

16
00:01:03,946 --> 00:01:08,186
She lacks a single view of the customer
across their organization's different digital

17
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:12,386
and offline channels, vendors,
data sources and departments,

18
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:14,876
most of which don't currently
talk to each other.

19
00:01:15,536 --> 00:01:18,316
This not only hinders the
effectiveness of all of the marketing,

20
00:01:18,786 --> 00:01:23,096
but it makes precisely targeting customers
through digital channels especially problematic

21
00:01:23,526 --> 00:01:26,086
and risk missed opportunities
and customer attrition.

22
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:30,246
Thus, we want to create truly
cross-channel customer profiles

23
00:01:30,346 --> 00:01:35,246
that leverage historical information, offline
interactions,and lifetime digital behavior

24
00:01:35,246 --> 00:01:39,186
across Web, mobile and social as
well as offsite third-party data

25
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:41,386
to truly understand customer behavior.

26
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:44,586
Our first step is in IBM Digital Analytics,

27
00:01:44,686 --> 00:01:48,956
which automatically builds a rich
customer profile data set from Web site

28
00:01:48,956 --> 00:01:51,076
and marketing program performance monitoring.

29
00:01:52,156 --> 00:01:55,606
A marketer can track and segment
customer behavior over time

30
00:01:55,646 --> 00:02:00,576
and across key customizable milestones
such as cart openers or first-time buyers.

31
00:02:01,116 --> 00:02:05,646
She can import offline data like transaction
histories and link it with digital behavior

32
00:02:05,706 --> 00:02:09,576
for more visibility on how digital is
influencing offline interactions --

33
00:02:10,336 --> 00:02:13,166
for example, e-mail promotions
and brick and mortar sales.

34
00:02:14,316 --> 00:02:18,036
Then, she can layer in or add mobile
reporting and social interactions

35
00:02:18,036 --> 00:02:22,566
into her customer profiles to better
understand how her customers are engaging

36
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,586
with her brand and content.

37
00:02:25,336 --> 00:02:30,826
Now our digital marketer has a single view of
each individual visitor and customer which pulls

38
00:02:30,826 --> 00:02:35,916
from all available online and offline channels
so she can best target visitors and customers

39
00:02:36,466 --> 00:02:38,386
where and how they interact with their business.

40
00:02:39,796 --> 00:02:43,366
Next, our marketer suspects that her site
has an underperforming conversion rate.

41
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:47,076
She wants to improve customers'
online experience across Web,

42
00:02:47,446 --> 00:02:50,956
mobile and social channels and make
it easier for them to convert --

43
00:02:51,116 --> 00:02:55,216
say, to book a travel itinerary
or download a key prospectus

44
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:58,306
or contact a live seller -- but
she isn't actually sure how.

45
00:02:58,966 --> 00:03:03,206
Using IBM Digital Analytics, she's able
to capture Web and mobile interaction data

46
00:03:03,206 --> 00:03:08,476
to highlight where users are struggling or
dropping off, measure and compare marketing ROI

47
00:03:08,476 --> 00:03:13,366
across all digital channels and make appropriate
changes in site or application design

48
00:03:13,456 --> 00:03:15,796
to help streamline their path to conversion.

49
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:21,266
Next, she compares key site KPIs to
industry peers and competitors to identify

50
00:03:21,266 --> 00:03:24,506
which specific metrics she
leads in or lags behind on.

51
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:29,156
For example, using the benchmark tool, she
can look at how her social sites compare

52
00:03:29,156 --> 00:03:30,476
to other companies in her vertical.

53
00:03:31,536 --> 00:03:37,156
Next, she investigates customer behavior,
convergent pathways, abandoners and bounce rates

54
00:03:37,156 --> 00:03:41,756
to uncover which promotions are working,
which sites are not performing and so forth.

55
00:03:42,716 --> 00:03:48,456
By doing this, she can discover which landing
pages, messaging products, channel combinations

56
00:03:49,086 --> 00:03:52,716
and more are most effective in driving
customers through to conversion,

57
00:03:52,716 --> 00:03:56,086
thus improving performance by
leveraging those marketing tactics.

58
00:03:57,116 --> 00:04:02,086
Now our marketer can make data-driven
marketing decisions based on live metrics

59
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:07,156
across all her digital marketing channels to
identify weaknesses and areas of strength.

60
00:04:08,626 --> 00:04:11,326
Our digital marketer is now
ready to engage her customers

61
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:15,876
and leverage her enormous digital
analytics resources with experience,

62
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,776
optimization and marketing execution tools.

63
00:04:19,706 --> 00:04:24,346
She not only wants to reach customers through
display ads and marketing e-mail channels

64
00:04:24,836 --> 00:04:29,336
but also present them with personalized,
targeted promotions and content

65
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,956
to optimize response rates
and boost convergence.

66
00:04:32,816 --> 00:04:37,806
Building on her earlier customer analytics, our
marketer now understands what segments she wants

67
00:04:37,846 --> 00:04:44,486
to retarget for promotions and can create highly
tailored and personalized e-mail, advertising,

68
00:04:44,856 --> 00:04:46,956
search and recommendation content.

69
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:51,146
Then she pushes targeted e-mail and
display ads to recapture visitors

70
00:04:51,426 --> 00:04:53,656
with integrated in-suite execution tools.

71
00:04:54,306 --> 00:05:00,676
She also uses automated personalized product or
content recommendations for each visitor based

72
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:03,466
on browsing histories and
wisdom of the crowd data.

73
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:09,496
Using new Tealeaf technology, she can
also drill into specific user sessions

74
00:05:09,566 --> 00:05:14,166
and replay each user, Web, or mobile
interaction in context to help visualize

75
00:05:14,626 --> 00:05:19,286
and analyze UI improvements and better
understand individual customer experiences.

76
00:05:20,426 --> 00:05:23,606
And now, we're finally able to
optimize each customer's experience

77
00:05:23,606 --> 00:05:27,976
across their digital lifecycle and
retarget based on deep individual analytics

78
00:05:28,276 --> 00:05:29,906
and cross-channel visitor profiles.

79
00:05:30,746 --> 00:05:35,176
