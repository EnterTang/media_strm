袭击国会大厦的罪魁祸首
for the attack of the Capitol.

18
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,740
总统先生  我们已经身处狼穴了
The jackals are at the door, Mr. President.

19
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,560
我觉得我们快知道真相了
I think we're really close to cracking this thing.

20
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,890
你的首席探员失踪了
Your lead investigator is missing.

21
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,660
试图杀你的人依旧活着
The man who tried to kill you is still alive.

22
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,040
白宫里的叛徒身份依然成谜
And the mole in the White House remains unknown.

23
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,750
我要解除你的权力  即刻生效
I am relieving you of your command, effective immediately.

24
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,800
-什么  -将军  你被撤职了
- What? - General, you are fired.

25
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,920
你杀了我的亲人
You kill my family...

26
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,120
我也杀你的
I kill yours.

27

杰森
Jason...

28
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,550
奏效了
It's all working.

29
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,460
所有人的注意力都在联调局那边  而非我们
Everyone's focused on the FBI, not us.

30
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,460
汉娜在哪
Where is Hannah?

31
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,480
出外勤了
On assignment.

32
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,250
打开所有的集装箱进行搜索

00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,170
手放在脑后  手放在脑后
Get your hands behind your head! Hands behind your head!

35
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,470
跪在地上  快
On the ground right now!

36
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,760
手举过头顶  跪下
Hands above your head! Get on your knees!

37
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,680
-你们不明白  -快  跪下
- You don't understand! - Now! On the ground!

38
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,260
手放在我能看到的地方
Put your hands where I can see them!

39
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,040
跪在地上  快点
Get on the ground! Do it!

40
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,860
-好吧  -跪下
- Okay. - Get on your knees!

41
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,590
跪下  我不会再说第二次了
I said get on the ground! I'm not gonna ask you again!

42
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,290
退后  不然我就引爆炸弹
Get back, or I'll detonate it!

43
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,420
退后  不然我就炸了这里
Get back, or I'll blow it!

44
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:06,850
把枪放下  我是认真的
Put your guns down! I mean it!

45
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,950
停  不准开火  退后
Stop. Nobody fires. Get back!

46
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,190
退后
Get back!

47
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,710
快追
Go, go!

48
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:18,790
去后面  上楼
Go back! Up the stairs!

49
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,150
让开
Get out of the way!

50
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,250
快啊
Come on!

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,300
别动  让我看到你的双手  别动
Freeze! Let me see your hands! Hold it right there!

52
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,350
总统先生
Mr. President.

53
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,150
有什么消息
What have you got?

54
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,420
联调局把她拘留了
The FBI has her in custody.

55
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,160
我要尽快见到她
I want to talk to her as soon as possible.

56
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,100
是  总统先生
Yes, sir.

57
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,560
我已经说过了  我跟这事没关系
I already told you -- I had nothing to do with this.

58
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,280
我在车后座醒过来
I woke up in the back of the van --

59
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,220
我们在你公寓发现的图纸怎么解释
What about the schematics we found in your apartment --

60
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,390
车库的结构图
the structural blueprints to the garage?

61
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,700
你把车停在了承重梁正下方
You parked your van right under a load-bearing beam,

62
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,510
如果你想炸毁大楼
which is exactly where you'd want to park

63
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,020
就必须把车停在那里
if you want to take the building down.

64
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:06,930
汉娜
Hannah.

65
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,830
幸好你没事
Thank God you're okay.

66
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,490
马上解开她的手铐
Get those cuffs off her right now.

67
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,190
她是这起恐怖袭击的主要嫌犯
She's a lead suspect in a terrorist attack.

68
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,480
-是才怪  放了她  -谁授命的
- The hell she is. Let her go. - Under whose authority?

69
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,880
美国总统
The president of the United States.

70
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,510
说得和真的似的
Yeah, right.

71
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,450
总统想要马上见她
He wants her in his office ASAP.

72
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,520
嗯
Yeah.

73
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,350
丹  白宫打给我了
Dan, I got the White House on the line.

74
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:24,850
你刚才说什么来着
You were saying?

75
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,300
你还好吗
You all right?

76
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,860
他们杀了杰森
They killed Jason.

77
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,700
我们得向总统汇报我们所了解的情况
All right, we have to tell the president what we know.

78
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,720
他们想陷害我发动恐袭
They wanted to blame me for an attack,

79
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,700
所以伪造了放在我公寓里的证据
so they planted evidence in my apartment.

80
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,960
然后通知了联调局
They called the FBI,

81
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,070
告诉他们我带着炸弹去了车库
said that I'd be in the garage with a bomb.

82
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,540
我们在审问从货轮上抓到的嫌疑人
We're interrogating the suspects that we arrested on the freighter.

83
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,110
他们供出了窝点
They're giving up Intel on the cells.

84
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,220
劳埃德那边怎么样了
What about Lloyd?

85
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,850
我们找到的唯一联系是
The only link that we've managed to find

86
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,460
货轮归布朗宁-里德旗下
is between the ship and

87
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,070
一间已倒闭的子公司所有
a defunct subsidiary of Browning Reed.

88
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,510
证据还不够充分
It's not a smoking gun.

89
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,210
那又怎样  汤姆  你得逮捕那混蛋
So what? You need to bring that bastard in, Tom.

90
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,320
我也同意
I agree, sir.

91
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,520
如果不能定他罪的话
There's no point in bringing him in today

92
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,970
抓他根本没有意义
if we have to let him out tomorrow.

93
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,010
我们得像对付麦克利什那样对付他
We need to play this the same way that we did MacLeish.

94
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,470
结果呢
Well, look how that turned out.

95
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,200
长官
Sir?

96
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,300
我同意他们的观点
I agree with them.

97
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,010
特别是现在我们不知道
Especially given the fact that we don't know

98
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,640
白宫里面的叛徒是谁
who the traitor is in the White House.

99
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,940
去抓他吧
Bring him in.

100
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,360
我们的目标是帕特里克·劳埃德
Our target is Patrick Lloyd.

101
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,490
我们认为他是国会大厦爆炸案的幕后主使
We believe that he is responsible for the bombing on our Capitol.

102
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,720
他现在住在位于弗吉尼亚州沃伦顿西边
He currently resides on a 100-acre horse farm

103
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,500
一处四十公顷的养马场里
west of Warrenton, Virginia.

104
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,710
我们必须认为他会全副武装
We should assume he is heavily armed.

105
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,520
他杀了我们的朋友  杀了我们的领袖
He killed our friends, and he killed our leaders.

106
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,700
我们要活捉他
We will take him alive,

107
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,930
并让他对我们的所作所为付出代价
and we will make him pay for everything he took from us.

108
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,160
大家都清楚了吗
Is everyone clear on that?

109
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,370
清楚
Yes.

110
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:10,870
好的  我们出发
All right. Let's move out.

111
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:22,540
柯克曼政府存在着联调局阴谋吗
Is there an FBI conspiracy in the Kirkman Administration?

112
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,990
这令人感到不安  奈特  十分不安
It's very concerning, Nate -- very concerning.

113
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:25,950
目前的已知信息
I mean, what we now know,

114
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,980
使我们对总统所说的一切都产生了怀疑
it casts doubt on everything the president has ever told us.

115
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,380
我们还怎么能信任他
How are we supposed to trust him?

116
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,840
请进
Come in.

117
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,450
有什么消息了
What have you got?

118
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,970
目前我们已确认位于蒙大纳  亚利桑那
So far, we've identified cells in Montana, Arizona,

119
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,040
宾州  新泽西和新墨西哥州的窝点
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New Mexico.

120
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,840
联调局的境内威胁联合反恐部队
Now, the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force on Domestic Threats

121
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,590
已派小队前往这些地点以便协调突击
is moving teams into position so we can coordinate the raids,

122
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,740
避免打草惊蛇
not tip them off.

123
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,690
我读了他们的宣言
You know, I read their "manifesto."

124
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,540
真是太荒唐了
It was ridiculous.

125
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,640
他们引用的历史警句恰到好处
They use just the right amount of historical quotes

126
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,100
以试图正当化自己的所作所为
to try and make themselves sound legitimate.

127
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,280
这与党派无关
They're not political.

128
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,830
这是对权力的攫取  企图发动政变
This is a power grab -- an attempted coup.

129
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,020
劳埃德那边处理得怎么样了
Where are we at with Lloyd?

130
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,070
战术部队已经出发了
Tactical team's en route.

131
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,840
我们很快就能将他拿下
We'll have him in custody within the hour.

132
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,570
一有消息立刻通知我
I want updates as soon as they come in.

133
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:05,320
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

134
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,260
干得漂亮  法索局长  谢谢
Great work, Director Foerstel. Thank you.

135
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,510
谢谢  总统先生
Thank you, Mr. President.

136
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,510
这论点很出彩  鲍曼议员
That's an excellent argument, Senator Bowman,

137
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,990
但我觉得下一位嘉宾可能会反对你的观点
but I'm sure my next guest will probably disagree --

138
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,910
联调局掩盖了真相吗  柯克曼沉默了

139
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,490
有请白宫前幕僚长亚伦·肖尔
recent White House chief of staff Aaron Shore.

140
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:19,370
谢谢  奈特
Thank you, Nate.

141
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,530
你想对担心存在政府阴谋论的
So, what do you say to all the Americans out there

142
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,790
美国人民说些什么
who are worried about a government conspiracy?

143
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,770
我会说柯克曼总统大概是
I'd say that President Kirkman is

144
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,990
我认识的人里面最诚实的一位了
probably the most honest man I've ever met.

145
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,630
我认为你和鲍曼议员
And I think you and Senator Bowman

146
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,400
都试图将国家安全问题
are both trying to score political points

147
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,130
变成自己的政治筹码
over matters of national security.

148
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,860
你是说报道是假的吗  肖尔先生
Are you saying this story isn't true, then, Mr. Shore?

149
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,970
我是说我了解得并不全面
I'm saying I haven't been fully briefed,

150
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,040
议员也是一样
and neither has the senator,

151
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,280
所以我们中没有一个人有权作出指控
so neither one of us should be making any kind of accusations.

152
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,120
但事实是
Well, the fact remains --

153
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,660
如果涉及了国家安全问题
if these are matters of national security,

154
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,140
总统就应该向公众澄清
the president should just say so.

155
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,530
但至今他什么也没说  这令局势很不利
But so far, he's said nothing. That's a disservice.

156
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,180
我非常了解总统
Knowing the president as well as I do...

157
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:58,250
没人有权作出指控

158
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,210
我确信即使他的确隐瞒了某些事实
I'm sure if he's holding on to any kind of secret,

159
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,530
那也是为了全美国民众的安危着想
it's for the safety of the American people.

160
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,320
如果说有人在帮倒忙  那也是你才对
If anyone is doing a disservice here, it's you.

161
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,090
敬请大家明天继续收看本节目
Stay tuned tomorrow, folks.

162
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,450
这个故事没有完结
This story's not going anywhere.

163
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,280
-我是摩尔  -我是威尔士
- Moore. - It's Wells.

164
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,230
你看到劳埃德了吗
You have eyes on Lloyd?

165
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,690
看到了  他还在房子里
Yeah, he's still in the house.

166
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,420
好的  很好
All right, good.

167
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,810
原位等待  我们在路上了
Hold your position. We're en route.

168
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:12,780
收到
Copy.

169
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,130
洛萨诺已拿到包裹  一切就绪

170
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,960
执行任务

171
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,240
执行任务

172
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,110
威尔士探员
Agent Wells!

173
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,000
这里没人
All clear here.

174
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,890
给我一份布朗宁·里德和其子公司名下
I want a list of every plane, truck, car, ship, helicopter

175
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:09,000
所有飞机  卡车  汽车和直升机的清单
registered to Browning Reed or their subsidiaries,

176
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,440
而且要立刻追踪到位
and I want it tracked now.

177
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,510
调动联邦航管局
That means FAA,

178
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,800
-州机动车辆管理局  -威尔士探员
- it means state DMV, - Agent Wells!

179
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,650
线上搜索  当地执法部门
it means ATL, law enforcement.

180
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,060
无论用什么手段  马上给我查清楚
Whatever you have to do, you get it done.

181
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:16,870
-威尔士探员  -什么事
- Agent Wells. - Yeah.

182
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,070
弗吉尼亚州的高速公路巡警
Virginia highway patrol said

183
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,740
发现了一辆登记在劳埃德名下的车辆
they spotted a vehicle registered to Lloyd

184
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,140
在沿州际公路南行
driving south on the interstate.

185
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,210
打开对讲机
Open the walkie.

186
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,310
威尔士探员
Agent Wells!

187
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,560
帕特里克·劳埃德在切萨皮克的交通临检处
I got a Patrick Lloyd sighting at a traffic stop in Chesapeake.

188
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,220
运输安全局的人说
TSA says they got eyes on him

189
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,790
在罗利达勒姆国际机场看到他
over at Raleigh-Durham International.

190
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,680
现在又有报告说
They're now saying his credit card was just used

191
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,920
他刚刚在匹兹堡的汽车站使用过信用卡
at a bus station in Pittsburgh.

192
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,470
查到他的银行卡  在德克萨斯州的布兰诺
I got a hit on his ATM card -- in Plano, Texas.

193
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,420
骗局
Shell game.

194
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:40,780
去他妈的
Damn it!

195
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,360
大家都在问  下一次的汇报是什么时候
Everyone's asking - when the next briefing is.

196
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,120
在我有料可以爆给他们之前
Well, until I can give them something more than a "No comment,"

197
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,840
我要尽可能地回避媒体
I'm gonna stay away from the press for as long as possible.

198
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,310
事情进展还顺利吗
How's that working out for you?

199
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,460
我要开始锁办公室的门了
And I'm gonna start locking my office door.

200
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,440
锁门也阻碍不了我  相信我
Oh, that's not gonna slow me down. Trust me.

201
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,640
你想干什么  埃布
What do you want, Abe?

202
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,930
我想得到白宫的回应
A White House comment.

203
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,390
我已经回应了你的报道  那就是无可奉告
I already gave your story a "no comment."

204
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,570
这对话是不是似曾相识
Haven't we done this before?

205
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,650
我感觉这像是  旧事重演
I feel like it's, like, "Groundhog Day" with you.

206
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,000
艾尔萨卡是过去的事了
Al-Sakar was yesterday's story.

207
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,190
我说的是将于明天刊登的报道
I'm talking - about tomorrow's edition.

208
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,860
这次"无可奉告"可派不上用场了
A "No comment" Is not gonna cut it this time.

209
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,860
那的确是部好电影
It's a good movie, though.

210
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,860
Groundhog Day亦指电影《偷天情缘》

211
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,280
总统先生
Mr. President.

212
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,150
得和你说点紧要事  先生
Major flag for you, sir.

213
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:21,950
什么事
What is it?

214
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,370
埃布·莱纳德在写一篇报道
Abe Leonard is running a story claiming

215
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,980
称联调局副局长杰森·亚特伍德
that FBI Deputy Director Jason Atwood

216
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:30,340
在总统办公室里因谋杀马吉德·纳萨尔被捕
was arrested in the Oval for the murder of Majid Nassar.

217
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,000
他说白宫把这消息封锁了
He says the White House covered it up.

218
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,660
你觉得我要怎样回应他
I mean, how do you want to respond to this?

219
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,880
跟莱纳德先生说我想见他
Tell Mr. Leonard I want to see him.

220
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,350
抱歉
Sorry?

221
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,280
安排个会议  我要亲自和他谈谈
Set up a meeting -- face-to-face.

222
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,130
谢谢你
Thank you.

223
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,980
我打不通他电话
I can't get through to him.

224
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,280
他要解决掉莱纳德·埃布的报道
He's needs to address the Abe Leonard story.

225
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:56,410
我明白你想汤姆表现得像一个政治家
I know you want Tom to behave like a politician,

226
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,890
但这样他就不再是他自己了  艾米丽
but that's just not who he is, Emily.

227
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,170
他是美国总统  艾丽克斯
He is the president of the United States, Alex.

228
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,690
他要为白宫争辩
He needs to defend the office.

229
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:06,030
我知道  他会按他自己的方式来做
Yes, I know, and he will -- in his own way.

230
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:10,090
你会在这里待多久  约个午餐吧
How long are you in town for? I miss our lunches.

231
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,420
我今晚就要回去了
I got to head back tonight.

232
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,920
我准备跟朋友在海亚当斯酒店随便吃点东西
I'm just gonna grab a bite with a friend at The Hay-Adams.

233
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,410
还有  艾米丽
And, Emily?

234
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,640
一切都会好起来的
It's gonna be okay.

235
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,670
没错
Right.

236
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,380
他是怎样逃掉的
How did he get by us?

237
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,630
不知道
Don't know.

238
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,030
应该是那叛徒通风报信的
The working theory is that the traitor tipped him off.

239
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,690
不幸的是  我们至今还无法找到他
And, unfortunately, we're still no closer to finding him.

240
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,720
我们要冻结他的资产  榨干那混蛋
We need to freeze his assets -- bleed the son of a bitch dry.

241
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,030
联系财政部  我们要起草一项行政命令
Contact Treasury. We'll have an executive order drafted.

242
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,590
-是的  总统先生  -谢谢你
- Yes, sir. - Thank you.

243
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,780
每位总统都要处理一个重大危机
Every president has a defining crisis.

244
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,090
而汤姆  你有好几个呢
You, Tom, have had several.

245
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,750
但是你会经受住这次危机
But you are going to weather this.

246
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,640
因为不管怎样  事情都将接近尾声
Because one way or another, it's all coming to an end.

247
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,910
而与此同时呢
And in the meantime?

248
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,800
为冲击做好准备
Brace for impact.

249
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,330
至少这方面我越来越得心应手了
Well, at least I'm getting better at that.

250
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,090
华盛顿白宫
网络连接提示
正在建立安全连接

251
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,470
需要密码  区分大小写

252
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,020
保密IP路由网络

253
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,320
我是里特
Ritter.

254
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,260
我是恰克  快来汉娜的办公室
It's Chuck. Get to Hannah's office now.

255
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,420
马克
法雷尔
美国海军
中尉
无限期

256
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,100
美国军警部门
法雷尔  马克
中尉

257
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,480
怎么了
What is it?

258
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,800
还记得上次的入侵事件吗
Okay, remember the hack

259
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,020
用来传送马吉德·纳萨尔的视频那次
that was used to deliver the Majid Nassar video?

260
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,720
记得  毁了白宫西翼一半的电脑
Yeah. That attack destroyed half the computers in the West Wing.

261
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,720
也留下了一个重要的数据痕迹
Also left behind a serious digital footprint.

262
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,450
那么假设
Now, working under the assumption

263
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:30,030
这个内鬼也是那次入侵事件的罪魁祸首
that our traitor was responsible for that hack, as well,

264
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,690
我一直在密切关注同一个代码
I've been keeping an eye out for that same code

265
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,450
以防再次有人使用
in case it was used again.

266
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,740
这个内鬼刚刚进入了保密IP路由网络
Our traitor just accessed SIPRNET.

267
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,790
五角大楼吗  为什么
The Pentagon? What for?

268
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,940
-不知道  -他没进入主机
- I don't know. - He's not in the mainframes.

269
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,830
看起来他只是想创建一个身份
Looks like he just wanted to create an I.D.

270
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,440
给谁用的身份
An I.D. for who?

271
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,810
法雷尔  马克
中尉

272
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,420
总统先生  亚伦·肖尔来了
Sir? Aaron Shore.

273
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,560
谢谢你  艾娃
Thank you, Ava.

274
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,520
总统先生
Mr. President.

275
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,370
亚伦  很高兴再次见到你
Aaron. Great to see you again.

276
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:37,820
-我也是  总统先生  -请坐
- You as well, sir. - Please.

277
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,750
早前我在电视上看到你了
I saw you on television earlier.

278
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,110
我真的很感激你说的那番话
I really appreciated what you had to say.

279
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,450
你知道我会一直保护你的  总统先生
You know I'll always protect you, sir.

280
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,540
我知道  所以我才叫你来
I know, which is why I've asked you here.

281
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:49,020
我将要和你说的事非常机密
What I'm about to tell you is strictly classified.

282
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,490
我们知道白宫里有内鬼
We know that there's a traitor in the White House.

283
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,650
我们一直没能确定他的身份
We haven't been able to identify him,

284
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,790
但我们知道他和国会大厦爆炸案有关
but we know he was involved in the Capitol bombing

285
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,660
而且我被任命为指定幸存者
and was instrumental in having me appointed

286
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,780
他也起到了推动作用
as the Designated Survivor.

287
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,370
你曾是总统里士满的幕僚之一
You were part of President Richmond's staff.

288
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,500
你知道有可能会是谁吗
Do you have any idea who this could be?

289
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,850
这么说不是兰登吗
So, it wasn't Langdon?

290
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,460
兰登已经被关押了
Langdon's in custody.

291
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:11,890
我们在找的这个人
The person we're looking for

292
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,790
正在销毁此次阴谋的证据
is actively destroying evidence of the conspiracy.

293
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,260
我知道一下子很难接受
I know this is a lot to take in.

294
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,100
但我希望你仔细看看你的记录
But I would like you to go back over your records,

295
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,930
看看有什么引人注意的地方
see if anything stands out.

296
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,110
是  总统先生
Yes, sir.

297
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,570
谢谢你
Thank you.

298
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,580
亚伦  我们时间不多了
Aaron, we don't have a lot of time.

299
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,220
我马上去查  总统先生
I'll get right to it, sir.

300
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,200
他给洛萨诺创建了一个身份
He created an I.D. for Lozano

301
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,420
让他能进入五角大楼
to access the Pentagon.

302
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,380
什么
What?

303
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,970
你得立刻提醒五角大楼保安局
You need to alert Pentagon Force Protection right now.

304
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,870
已经做了  我们把他的照片传了过去
It's already done. We've sent over his picture.

305
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:43,970
他们正在封锁大楼
They're locking the building down now.

306
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:46,930
是啊  但五角大楼占地近三百公顷
Yeah, but the Pentagon's 583 acres.

307
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:49,200
他有大把地方可以藏身
That gives him plenty of places to hide.

308
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,530
莱纳德先生
Mr. Leonard.

309
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,030
我是汤姆·柯克曼
Tom Kirkman.

310
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,400
总统先生
Mr. President.

311
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,330
请坐
Please.

312
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,360
谢谢
Thank you.

313
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:51,380
赛斯和我说了你想报道的新闻
So, Seth told me about the story you wanted to run.

314
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,920
总统先生  如果你想劝我收手
Mr. President, if you think you're gonna get me to back down,

315
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,510
那就是在浪费时间
you're wasting your time.

316
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,090
随便你派多少人来盯我
And you can send all the goons you want,

317
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,180
但我绝不保持沉默
but I'm not staying silent.

318
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,090
我不知道你在说什么
Well, I don't know exactly what you're talking about.

319
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,230
我从没派人干过这种事
I haven't sent anyone anywhere.

320
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,890
事实上  我和联调局说得很清楚了
In fact, I've been perfectly clear with the FBI --

321
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,940
我绝不容许恐吓新闻媒体
I will not tolerate any intimidation of the press.

322
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,140
而且很显然  如果我愿意的话
Besides, apparently, if I want,

323
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,890
我可以直接把你送进监狱
I can just throw you in jail.

324
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,680
你是在威胁我吗
Are you threatening me?

325
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:17,580
不  恰恰相反
No. The opposite.

326
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,100
我是想告诉你  我不会这么做
I'm trying to tell you that I won't do that.

327
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,320
我不会强迫你干任何事
I'm not gonna try and make you do anything.

328
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:23,660
好吧
Okay.

329
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,640
我是在请求你  拜托先别报道
I am asking you -- please, just hold your story.

330
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,030
你是指报道有误吗
Are you saying it's wrong?

331
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,970
是不完整
It's incomplete.

332
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:36,130
那不如你帮我补充完整吧
Well...how about you fill in the blanks for me?

333
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,610
我也希望我可以
I wish I could.

334
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:40,370
遗憾的是  事关国家安全
Unfortunately, it's a matter of national security.

335
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,110
我能问你个问题吗  总统先生
Can I ask you a question, Mr. President?

336
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:48,420
问吧
Yeah.

337
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,530
如果你手握证据显示现政府有所隐瞒
If you were sitting on a story about a government cover-up,

338
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,960
你还会相信总统所说的话吗
would you trust a word the president said?

339
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,190
也许不会吧
Maybe not.

340
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,090
但你真的相信
But do you honestly believe

341
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,510
倘若总统故意掩盖事实
if a president was involved in a cover-up

342
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,570
他还会蠢到
that he'd be stupid enough

343
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:04,270
像现在这样与记者面对面交谈吗
to sit across from a journalist such as yourself?

344
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:08,360
我最敬仰的总统是富兰克林·罗斯福
My favorite president is Franklin Roosevelt.

345
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,120
我想给你看点东西
I wanted to show you something.

346
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:15,660
你觉得这照片是什么时候拍的
When do you think this picture was taken?

347
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,310
我猜是战时
I expect during the war.

348
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,410
知道它是什么时候公布的吗
Any idea when it was published?

349
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,410
总统过世后
Just after the president passed away.

350
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:28,660
你看  战争期间有这么一种共识
You see, during the war, there was an understanding --

351
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,840
展现美国的力量
It was more important to project American strength

352
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,270
比报道总统的弱点更重要
than describe the president's frailties.

353
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:36,140
媒体早就拿到了照片  但他们选择不去报道
The press had the photos, but they chose not to use them.

354
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,190
或许你认为现在并非战争期间
Now, you might not think that we're in a war,

355
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,250
但我可以保证  这就是场战争
but I promise you that we are,

356
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,070
如果你发表了那篇文章
and if you publish that article,

357
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,980
将会让我们更难取胜
it's going to make it that much more difficult for us to win.

358
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,460
我真心希望能把知道的事告诉你  但我不能
Now, I honestly wish I could tell you what I know, but I can't.

359
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,460
所以  就是这样
So...here we are.

360
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,760
你得作出选择
You're gonna have to make a choice --

361
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,920
无论你是否相信我
whether you believe me or not.

362
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,040
科克兰将军
General Cochrane.

363
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,560
你不是来修电缆的
Well. You're not the cable repairman.

364
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,850
退休生活怎么样
How are you handling retirement?

365
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,540
这不是退休
It's not retirement.

366
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,820
这是软禁
It's house arrest.

367
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,200
你让柯克曼别无选择
Well, you didn't leave Kirkman a choice there.

368
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,350
我不怪柯克曼  他做了他应该做的
I don't blame Kirkman. He did what he had to do.

369
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,210
这可不像你啊
Well, that's quite the reversal.

370
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,000
想法是会变的
Opinions change.

371
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,990
你来干什么  亚伦
What are you doing here, Aaron?

372
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,050
白宫里有一个内鬼
There's a traitor in the White House.

373
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,390
我在调查所有拥有高级权限
And I'm looking into anyone with high-level access

374
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,640
并参与了
who had any involvement

375
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,460
选择指定幸存者的人
in choosing the Designated Survivor.

376
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,000
这样的人并不多
That's not a long list.

377
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,530
你能帮忙吗
Can you help?

378
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,650
为什么找我
Why me?

379
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,840
你在白宫任职八年
You served eight years in the White House --

380
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,430
待过国安委  武装部  联席会议
NSC, military office, Joint Chiefs.

381
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:03,240
没人比你更了解安全权限的事
No one knows more about security access than you do.

382
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,060
我需要这些系统立即恢复使用
I need these systems back online right away.

383
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,150
五角大楼保卫局  我是鲍威尔
Pentagon Force Protection. This is Powell.

384
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,690
我是联调局探员汉娜·威尔士
This is FBI Agent Hannah Wells.

385
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,230
你们找到洛扎诺了吗
Have you found Lozano yet?

386
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,520
没有  而且我们的安全系统出现了故障
No. And we're having trouble with our security system.

387
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,540
我们所有的监控摄像头都被黑了
All of our surveillance cameras are being scrambled somehow.

388
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,070
但我们在处理了
But we're working on it.

389
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,300
要求传送地址
端口号

390
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,880
我来告诉你一些你们要找的人的信息
Let me tell you something about the man you're looking for.

391
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:42,440
加入中情局之前  他为五角大楼的
Before the CIA, he worked for the Pentagon for two years

392
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,910
反间谍活动办公室工作过两年
in the Counterintelligence Field Activities Office.

393
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,150
他了解那栋建筑的每一个角落
He knows every single corner of that building.

394
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,730
你们必须让摄像头工作起来
You need to get those cameras up and running.

395
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,200
我们必须找到他
We have to find him.

396
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,870
状态  传送中

397
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,670
完成

398
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,540
我见了科克兰将军
I met with General Cochrane.

399
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,530
他帮我从里士满的行政机构中
He helped me put together this list of staffers

400
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:30,120
整理出了这份名单
inside of the Richmond Administration

401
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,090
他们都符合我们谈及的条件
that fit the criteria we're talking about --

402
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,510
有高级权限
high-level access,

403
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,720
并参与了选择指定幸存者
involvement in choosing the Designated Survivor.

404
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,520
干得好
Great work.

405
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,410
尽快把这些资料给里特探员
Get these to Agent Ritter as quickly as possible.

406
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,330
好的  先生
Yes, sir.

407
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,710
总统先生  我必须要说
Mr. President, I do have to say --

408
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,640
如果没有将军的帮忙我是无法完成的
I couldn't have done this without the General's help.

409
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,060
我觉得他和袭击并无关联
I don't think he had anything to do with the attack.

410
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,630
我也觉得
Neither do I.

411
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,610
正在追踪嫌疑人
In pursuit of suspect,

412
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,250
他正在前往乔治城铁路站场
heading towards Georgetown Rail Yard.

413
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,300
请求支援
Send backup.

414
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:09,110
这事还没结束
It's not over.

415
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,510
没有牺牲
No victory...

416
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,190
就没有胜利
without sacrifice.

417
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:36,860
丹尼斯
Dennis!

418
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,570
丹尼斯应该开溜了
I think Dennis stepped away.

419
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:42,530
知道吗  作为看门人
You know, as far as gatekeepers go,

420
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:43,710
这里还差了点
there's a lot to be desired here.

421
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:46,150
我觉得你应该升升级了  赛斯
I think maybe it's time to trade up, Seth.

422
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:48,240
那么你来吧
You know, you should just move in at this point.

423
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,850
我还是喜欢我现在这样
I prefer the view from my side of the street.

424
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,650
你想怎样  埃布
What do you want, Abe?

425
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,750
我想让你帮我转告总统
Look... I want you to tell the president

426
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,320
他的话我认真思考了很久
I thought long and hard about what he said to me.

427
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:01,230
我会尊重他的要求
I'm going to honor his request.

428
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,660
但是
But...

429
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:04,710
不是无限期的
not indefinitely.

430
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,960
我很意外  不知道该说什么了
I'm... speechless. I don't know what to say.

431
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:12,290
作为新闻发言人这水平可不行
Not the best quality for a press secretary.

432
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:16,250
那我就说谢谢你吧
Well, l-let me just say "thank you."

433
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,210
也行
That'll work.

434
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:20,790
千万别以为我这是示弱了
Don't think for a second I'm going soft here.

435
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:23,280
我还是会给你找麻烦的
I'll still be kicking your ass all over the schoolyard.

436
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,670
随时奉陪
You know where to find me.

437
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,860
汉娜
Hannah.

438
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:42,860
恰克
Chuck.

439
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,810
天哪  你还好吗
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

440
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,370
我没事
Yeah.

441
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,660
需要我送你
Can I get you a...

442
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,450
去医院吗
hospital?

443
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:54,760
还是别的
Or something?

444
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:56,550
他们已经让我出院了
They already checked me out.

445
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,520
知道洛萨诺为什么去五角大楼了吗
Did you guys find out why Lozano was at the Pentagon yet?

446
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,230
希望我们能很快知道答案
Hopefully, we'll get answers soon.

447
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:06,290
好吧
Yeah.

448
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:08,600
你需要我留下来吗
Do you want me to stay?

449
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,070
不
No.

450
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,620
不用  法索那边需要你
No, Foerstel needs you.

451
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,120
不过尽快跟我联系
But check in as soon as you can.

452
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:15,850
好的
Yeah.

453
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,210
以免我忘了  我并没有
Hey, before I forget -- I wasn't...

454
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,350
想故意打探什么的
you know, snooping around or anything,

455
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,640
不过你好像收到了很多电子邮件
but you got about a thousand unread e-mails.

456
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,970
是啊  我一直忙着呢
Yeah, I've been busy.

457
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,160
有一封是杰森·亚特伍德的
There's one from Jason Atwood.

458
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,020
我觉得应该告诉你
I thought you'd like to know.

459
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,360
谢谢
Thank you.

460
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,530
这项行动仍然有可行性
The operation is still viable.

461
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:11,960
现在  我会清除你
Right now, I'm brooming any connection

462
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:14,640
布朗宁-里德以及国会任务之间的联系
between you, Browning Reed, and the Capitol mission.

463
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,670
那我想知道
Then I want to know why there were

464
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,030
为什么两名联调局调查员来调查我的房产
two federal investigators on my property.

465
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,750
这你别担心  我会去查
Don't worry about it. I'm on it.

466
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,460
很快  就不会再有书面记录等等的问题
Soon, there'll be no paper trail whatsoever.

467
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,470
而且威尔士探员已被抓获
And Agent Wells is contained.

468
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,540
一切都在按计划进行
Everything is proceeding as planned.

469
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,750
你确定
And you're sure

470
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:34,090
联调局不会发现任何端倪吗
that the FBI has no idea what's coming?

471
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:36,590
-控制权在我们手里  -那就好
- We have operational control. - Good.

472
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:39,430
确保剧情会按照我们的剧本发展
Just make sure that the narrative is what we want it to be.

473
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:41,100
我们就快接近了
We are so close.

474
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,750
我们也许没有总统地位
We might not have the presidency,

475
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,680
但可以十分肯定  不久以后
but you can be damn sure that before long,

476
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,210
我们就能掌控整个国家
we will have the country.

477
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,890
惠特克先生
Mr. Whitaker.

478
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,690
我们能谈谈吗
Can I have a word, please?

479
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,260
请进
Come in.

480
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,730
亚特伍德副局长
Deputy Director Atwood?

481
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,350
我是汉娜·威尔士探员
I'm Agent Hannah Wells.

482
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,130
对  来自芝加哥
Yes -- from Chicago.

483
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:36,410
梅里特探员让我告诉你
Agent Merritt tells me to tell you...

484
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:38,600
他还是很生你的气
that he's still very pissed at you.

485
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,230
长官  我和他的看法不是总能达成一致的
Sir, Agent Merritt and I didn't always see eye-to-eye.

486
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:44,850
他还跟我说你几乎违背了
He also tells me that you disobeyed

487
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,830
他给你的下达的每一个命令
practically every order he gave you.

488
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:49,200
不长官  我只违背那些值得违背的命令
No, sir -- only the orders worth disobeying.

489
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,630
他还说  你是他手下最优秀的探员之一
He also says that you were one of the best agents he's ever had,

490
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:56,840
这也是他对你的离开感到气愤的原因
which is why he's mad at you for leaving.

491
00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:00,690
就像我说的  他是个很棒的上司
Well, like I was saying, he was a-a great boss.

492
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,350
威尔士探员
Agent Wells...

493
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:09,040
实话告诉我  你会给我带来麻烦吗
in all honesty, will you cause me any trouble?

494
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,510
有可能  长官
Probably, sir.

495
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,580
欢迎来到华盛顿
Welcome to D.C.

496
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,200
我们就快接近了
We are so close.

497
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,880
我们也许没有总统地位
We might not have the presidency,

498
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,770
但可以十分肯定  不久以后
but you can be damn sure that before long,

499
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:51,280
我们就能掌控整个国家
we will have the country.

500
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,940
就是这样
And that's it.

501
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,140
全部的真相
That's everything.

502
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:00,420
很抱歉我把你们蒙在鼓里这么久
I am very sorry for keeping you in the dark for so long.

503
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,680
但我别无选择
But I didn't feel like I had any other choice.

504
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,210
希望你们能原谅我
I hope you can forgive me.

505
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:07,140
我理解  总统先生
I understand, Mr. President.

506
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,250
我也是  总统先生
Same here, sir.

507
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:11,480
所以是惠特克让你成为的指定幸存者
So, Whitaker made you Designated Survivor?

508
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,210
没错  他以国土安全部顾问的身份
Yes, as Homeland Security Advisor,

509
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,210
手握极佳的政治位置
he was well-positioned

510
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:16,320
为劳埃德执行了许多行动
to carry out a number of operations for Lloyd.

511
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,540
劳埃德现在在哪
Where's Lloyd now?

512
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,770
我们还在搜查当中
We're still searching for him.

513
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,400
不过作为世界上的头号通缉犯
But as the most wanted man on the planet,

514
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,120
找到他只是时间问题
it's just a matter of time.

515
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:23,040
与此同时
In the meantime,

516
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,530
联调局突袭了他在全国各地的
the FBI raided cells from his organization

517
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:26,880
基层组织
across the country.

518
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:28,360
逮捕了超过二百人
They've arrested over 200 people,

519
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,060
缴获了枪支  制造炸弹的材料
seizing firearms, bomb-making materials,

520
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:32,280
包括与国会大厦爆炸案中
including explosives --

521
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,490
使用的同一种炸药
the same kind that were used at the Capitol bombing.

522
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:36,900
赛斯
Seth...

523
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,900
是时候告诉美国民众事情的真相了
it's time to tell the American people the truth.

524
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,730
当然  我会通知各大电视台
Absolutely -- - I'll inform the networks,

525
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,000
确保他们能排出档期
make sure they clear some time.

526
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,170
这次我不想在总统办公室发表讲话
I don't want to speak from the Oval.

527
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,810
我想发表国会演讲  召开联席会议
I want to address Congress -- a joint session.

528
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,570
谢谢你们所有人
Thank you -- all of you.

529
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,330
你们所做的一切
For everything.

530
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,800
回去工作吧
Let's get back to work.

531
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,780
是  总统先生
Yes, sir.

532
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:01,950
亚伦  我能占用你一点时间吗
Aaron, can I borrow you for a moment?

533
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,070
总统先生
Sir?

534
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,390
你有什么计划
What are your plans?

535
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:09,950
我还在考虑
I'm still figuring that out.

536
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,260
我想让你回到白宫来
I'd like you back here at the White House.

537
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,260
你属于这里
This is where you belong.

538
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,870
很感谢您的表态  总统先生
I appreciate the gesture, Mr. President,

539
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,920
但是我的职位已经有人了
but... my position is been filled.

540
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,580
而且艾米丽干得很好
And Emily's doing a fantastic job.

541
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,990
我完全同意你的看法
I couldn't agree with you more.

542
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:24,610
我们会再给你找个职位
We'll find you another position.

543
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,560
说实话  总统先生  没有这样的职位
Frankly, sir, none exist.

544
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,990
那就造一个出来
Then I'll make one up.

545
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,660
亚伦  我想让你在这工作
Aaron, I want you here.

546
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,710
逼急了我拖也要把你拖过来
I'll draft you if I have to.

547
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:32,490
但我不接受"不"这个回答
But I won't take "No" for an answer.

548
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:34,030
你觉得呢
What do you say to that?

549
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:40,930
我很愿意为总统效劳
I say I serve at the pleasure of the president.

550
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:42,450
很好
Good.

551
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,380
因为从法律意义上讲  我不能把你拖过来
'Cause legally, I actually don't think I can draft you.

552
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,870
欢迎回来
Welcome back.

553
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:48,930
谢谢先生
Thank you, sir.

554
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,940
谢谢
Thank you.

555
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,700
今晚准备好了没  要演讲了高兴吗
You ready for tonight? Happy with your speech?

556
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,880
最好是准备好了
I better be.

557
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,670
这次是我自己写的稿
I wrote it myself this time.

558
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,620
我为你骄傲  年轻人
Well, I'm proud of you, son.

559
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,330
今晚坐在那看你演讲
And I'm going to be even prouder

560
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:10,870
我会更骄傲的
when I watch you from my seat tonight.

561
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:12,640
我正想跟您谈谈这件事
I wanted to talk to you about that.

562
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:13,420
说吧
Yeah.

563
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,440
这是那次袭击之后
This is gonna be - the first time since the attack

564
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,280
所有政府成员首次共聚一堂
that the entire government will be under the same roof.

565
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,550
而我要做出
Now I have to make a decision --

566
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,840
让谁留下来的决定
who to leave behind.

567
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:25,670
你是我心中做指定幸存者
I can't think of anyone I would want more

568
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,910
最合适的人选
to be my Designated Survivor than you.

569
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:33,030
我以前认为当指定幸存者
You know, I used to think that being Designated Survivor

570
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,800
是一种惩罚  一个玩笑
was a punishment -- a joke.

571
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,690
我也是
Me too.

572
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,070
但现在不是了
Not anymore.

573
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,100
确实不是了
No, not anymore.

574
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,720
这是我的荣幸  总统先生
It would be my honor, Mr. President.

575
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:50,700
谢谢
Thank you.

576
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,180
女士们  先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

577
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,650
国会成员们
members of Congress,

578
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,900
亲爱的美国民众
my fellow Americans.

579
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,040
我曾在就任总统伊始
At the very beginning of my presidency,

580
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,490
在那个笼罩着恐怖阴霾的重要夜晚
in the shadow of that terrible, fateful night,

581
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,180
与你们讲过话
I spoke to you,

582
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:18,260
我承诺过执政绝对透明
and I promised absolute transparency,

583
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,090
绝对真实
absolute truth.

584
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,850
但我违背了那些誓言
I betrayed that pledge

585
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:24,170
为的是保护联调局和特勤局
in an effort to protect an ongoing investigation

586
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:26,520
正在进行的调查
by the FBI and the Secret Service.

587
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:30,240
但是今晚  我的心情异常轻松
But tonight, I speak to you with a lightened heart

588
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,650
因为我终于能够把所有事实真相
because I can finally tell you the truth

589
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,770
告诉大家了
about what really happened to us.

590
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:36,580
最近一位受举国尊敬的记者
A recent article written

591
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:41,370
写了一篇文章  他说的没错
by one of our nation's most respected journalists was correct.

592
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:45,090
艾尔萨卡没有袭击我们的国会大厦
Al-Sakar did not attack our Capitol.

593
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:46,560
即使那个时候
Even though at the time,

594
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,370
大量的证据都指向他
overwhelming evidence suggested just that.

595
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:52,090
现在我们可以百分百确定地告诉大家
We can tell you now, with absolute certainty,

596
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:55,400
这场可怕的恐怖行动是由
that this horrific act was carried out

597
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,090
国内的恐怖团伙策划的
by a domestic terror group,

598
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:59,310
领导者叫帕特里克·劳埃德
led by a man named Patrick Lloyd.

599
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,420
帕特里克和他的朋友认为
Lloyd and his followers believed

600
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:04,270
伟大美国已经衰落
that American greatness was in its decline

601
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,420
他们认为我们不再是推翻
and that somehow, we were no longer heirs

602
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:10,420
法西斯主义和成功登月的
to the generations that pushed back the tide of fascism,

603
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,130
那代人的继承者
put men on the moon,

604
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,250
认为我们把柏林墙精神遗弃在历史之中
and relegated the Berlin Wall to the pages of history.

605
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:18,520
简而言之  这些人相信
In short, these people believed

606
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,640
我们最好的时光已一去不复返
that our best days were behind us

607
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,170
而他们  认为自己更懂
and that they, themselves,

608
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:24,560
如何重建我们的国家
knew better how to remake our country.

609
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,370
但他们错了
They were wrong --

610
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:29,340
错的非常离谱
in every possible way.

611
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:32,410
他们贬低了美国梦
They debased the American Dream and disrespected

612
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:35,410
践踏了无数个为保卫美国
the incredible sacrifices made by so many

613
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:37,680
而牺牲的先烈们
to build and sustain our nation.

614
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,440
但就算美国国旗因为他们的
And even though the fabric of America

615
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,730
暴力和仇恨有所磨损
may have been frayed by their violence and hatred,

616
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:45,280
我也很开心有一个事实是
I stand here rejoicing in the fact

617
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,120
国旗绝不会因此而撕裂
that it was never torn.

618
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:51,430
即使面临空前的恐惧  我们也没有抛弃彼此
In a time of unprecedented fear, we did not abandon one another.

619
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:56,330
没有抛弃我们的理想  我们的团结
Nor did we abandon our ideals, our sense of community,

620
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,450
我们的人民
our commonalities.

621
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,790
从在悲剧来临时
From the first responders who answered the call,

622
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:05,130
接到电话重进火海的急救人员
racing into the flames when tragedy struck,

623
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,900
到那些通过投票来
to the men and women who fulfilled their civic duties

624
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,310
履行公民义务的所有群众
by casting their ballots

625
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,480
即使头顶袭击的威胁
even under the threat of attack,

626
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:14,210
人民的光芒依旧刺破苍穹
our better angels have shined through.

627
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,620
我知道有时候
Now, I know that there are times

628
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,730
我们的国家显得四分五裂
when our country appears to be divided,

629
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:20,010
但我能看到有一样东西
but I have seen the one thing

630
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:22,330
把我们永远联系在一起
that will bind us together forever --

631
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:24,560
那就是爱
love.

632
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,460
对祖国的爱  对希望和梦想的爱
Love of country, love of hope, love of dreams,

633
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,540
对生命的爱  对自由和追寻幸福的爱
love of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

634
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,060
我是丈夫  是父亲  是这个国家的儿子
I am a husband, I am a father, and I am a son of this nation,

635
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:40,690
我从未如此骄傲  如此乐观
and never before have I been more proud, more optimistic.

636
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:46,800
你们不需要告诉我  你们深有同感
And I do not need you to tell me that you feel the same way, too,

637
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,080
因为我能从你们的眼中看出来
because I can see it in your eyes

638
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,840
从你们内心的声音里听出来
and hear it in your hearts.

639
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,960
正如圣·保罗告诫我们的一样
As Saint Paul admonished us,

640
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,480
"我们不要被恶战胜  要以善胜恶"
"Let us not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good."

641
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,300
美国不只是一个国家
You see, America is not just simply a country,

642
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,860
不是五十个州的简单集合
nor is it the sum of its 50 states.

643
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,060
美国是一种信念
It's an idea --

644
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,440
一种大胆而正义的信念
a bold and righteous idea,

645
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:10,500
一盏永不会熄灭的明灯
a guiding light that can never be extinguished.

646
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,900
所以我们要对世界其他国家们说
So let us say to the rest of the world --

647
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,730
我们期待你们的友好
we welcome your friendship and extend an open hand

648
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:19,250
也向所有寻求自由美好生活的人们伸出双手
to anyone who wants to make lives freer and better.

649
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:26,680
而与我们为敌的人  我只能警告你们
And to those who oppose us, I can only simply warn you --

650
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:30,150
你们时日无多了  因为我们的时代来临了
your days are numbered, for our time has come!

651
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:33,500
我重申  我们的时代来临了
I say again, our time has come.

652
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:39,510
美国人民们  请允许我说一句
And to the American people, let me say

653
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:42,500
能为你们服务是我毕生的荣耀
that it has been the privilege of my lifetime to serve you,

654
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,500
我向你们保证  我将继续努力
and I promise to continue serving

655
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:46,940
直到你们不再需要我为止
until I am asked of service no more.

656
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,660
感谢你们给我的荣誉
Thank you for the honor.

657
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,430
上帝保佑你们
God bless you.

658
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:00,490
上帝保佑美国
And God bless the United States of America.

659
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,300
谢谢
Thank you.

660
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,340
谢谢
Thank you.

661
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:13,070
谢谢你们做的一切
Thank you for everything.

662
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:21,330
爸
Daddy!

663
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,260
小宝贝
Little pea!

664
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:25,030
天啊  你怎么来了
Oh, my gosh! What are you doing here?

665
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,700
-李奥  -妈妈带我们来的
- Leo! - Mom brought us.

666
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,730
我实在无法不让他们见你了
I couldn't keep them away any longer.

667
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,710
天啊  我好想你
Oh, my gosh. I missed you so much.

668
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,530
你好美
You look so pretty.

669
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,370
打扰一下  先生  夫人
Excuse me, sir. Ma'am.

670
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:35,290
怎么了  麦克
What is it, Mike?

671
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,240
需要您立刻到指挥行动中心
You're needed in Command Ops right away.

672
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,470
我保证  马上就回来  好吗
I promise - I'll be right back, okay?

673
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:43,030
-我爱你  -我也爱你  亲爱的
- I love you. - I love you, too, sweetheart.

674
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:44,600
马上回来
I'll be right back.

675
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,690
抱歉
I'm sorry.

676
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,180
总统先生
Mr. President.

677
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:54,880
-稍息  -是  先生
- At ease. - Yes, sir.

678
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,200
什么情况
What's going on?

679
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,680
先生  我们知道洛萨诺
Sir, we know what Lozano

680
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,030
在五角大楼拿到了什么
was accessing at the Pentagon.

681
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,300
他黑进了国防部
He hacked the Defense Department's

682
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,320
最高机密的服务器
most highly classified server.

683
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,650
意味着什么
What does that mean?

684
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,820
意味着国家防御体系的
It means every single aspect

685
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:07,590
每一个环节
of our country's defense superstructure

686
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:09,770
都有危险  军队调动
is now vulnerable -- troop movements,

687
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:13,600
核武器储备  秘密线人的身份
intel on our nuclear arsenal, identities of our covert assets.

688
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,020
天啊
Oh, my God.

689
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,790
我们认为洛萨诺把这些数据
We think that Lozano

690
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,130
发给了帕特里克·劳埃德
sent the data to Patrick Lloyd.

691

692
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:23,120

695
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,890
没有

他手上握有的资源

697
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:31,760

前往世界任何地方
