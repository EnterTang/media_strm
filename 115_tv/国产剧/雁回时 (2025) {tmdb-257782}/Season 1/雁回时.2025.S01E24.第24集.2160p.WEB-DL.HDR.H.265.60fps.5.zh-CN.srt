我们刚得到更多的化验结果
We received results of more tests.

304
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,317
但不是个好消息,这是abc一种生化武器类型的菌株
The news isn't good.abcThis is a weaponised strain.

305
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,075
病毒被改造,可以更迅速地致命
lt has been engineered to kill more rapidly.

306
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,917
有多迅速?

307
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:01,119
基于验尸报告估计,若在零点感

308
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,232
前14小时是没有传染性的阶段
there's a noncontagious latency periodabcof 14 hours.

309

310
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,036
若病毒蔓延会有什么后果?
What are the epidemiological consequences?

311
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,720
若病毒在某个地点开始爆发
If the virus initiates at a single location,

312
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,280
一天内将感染大约两百人

313
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,120

By the end of day twoabcit could be in the thousands,

314
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,720
但那时还不必用人口的abc百分比来形容
but from there it's easier to talk aboutabcin percentage of population.

315
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,952
第一周过后,洛杉矶abc百分之九的居民将被感染
By the end of the fiirst week, nine per centabcof Los Angeles county will be infected.

316
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,069
百分之九?那就是超过一百万
Nine per cent?abcThat's over a million people.

317

so tell me， if someone were gonna try toabcrelease this virus into the general population，

319
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,392
他们要怎样做?
how would they do it?

320
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,274
很难知道,在任何地方abc都可以散播
That's the million-dollar question.abclt could come from anywhere.

321

我们不知道谁掌握着病毒abc也不知道将在哪里散播
We don't know who has it.abcWe don't know where they plan to release it.

322
