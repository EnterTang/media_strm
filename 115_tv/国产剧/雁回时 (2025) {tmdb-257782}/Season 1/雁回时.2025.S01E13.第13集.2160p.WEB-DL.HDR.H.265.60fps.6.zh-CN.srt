1
00:00:13,569 --> 00:00:16,355
恐怖份子正密谋
(Jack) Right now, terrorists are plotting

2
00:00:16,356 --> 00:00:19,074
暗杀总统候选人
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

3
00:00:19,158 --> 00:00:22,443
我老婆女儿也被挟持
My wife and daughter have been kidnapped.

4
00:00:22,536 --> 00:00:25,739
而我的同事 可能同时牵涉其中
And people that I work with may be involved in both.

5
00:00:26,457 --> 00:00:29,130
我是联邦探员杰克鲍尔
I'm FederalAgent Jack Bauer.

6
00:00:29,131 --> 00:00:32,377
今天将是我这辈子最长的一天
This is the longest day ofmy life.

7
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,866
以下是发生在中午12点至13点

8
00:00:35,867 --> 00:00:38,981
美国总统大选加州初选当天的事

9
00:01:06,281 --> 00:01:08,606
继续走
Keep moving.

10
00:01:13,288 --> 00:01:15,744
尼尔 去小路拦截他们
Neill, cut them off at the service road.

11
00:01:15,832 --> 00:01:19,332
其他的人去追他
- The rest of you, come up behind him. - lra...

12
00:01:19,419 --> 00:01:21,708
你怎么会让这种事发生?
How could you let this happen?

13
00:01:23,048 --> 00:01:25,387
我们准备在小路拦截他们
We're cutting them off at the service road.

14
00:01:25,388 --> 00:01:27,510
鲍尔跟他老婆女儿，还有瑞克
Bauer, his wife and daughter. And Rick.

15
00:01:27,594 --> 00:01:30,465
确定他们不会往回逃
Make sure they don't double back.

16
00:01:30,555 --> 00:01:33,209
-我以为我可以对付他
- I thought I could handle him. I thought...

17
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,175
-别再想了
- Stop thinking.

18
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:40,765
(coughing)

19
00:01:51,201 --> 00:01:54,819
我们得继续前进
OK, we... we have to keep moving.

20
00:01:54,913 --> 00:01:57,618
-万一爸他无法... -你爸会没事的
- What if Dad isn't... - No, your dad's OK.

21
00:01:57,708 --> 00:02:00,281
他说到水塔会合 我们就要这样做
He told us to meet him by the water tower and we will.

22
00:02:00,377 --> 00:02:02,457
我们只要沿着溪就行
We just have to follow the creek.

23
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:04,791
走吧，快点
Let's go. Come on! Let's go! Come on!

24
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:16,841
-我办不到 -闭嘴，你行而且你要坚持
- I can't... - Shut up. You can and you will.

25
00:02:16,935 --> 00:02:18,355
-我会耽搁你
- I'm slowing you down.

26
00:02:18,356 --> 00:02:20,886
-没错，所以你最好动作快点
- Yes, you are, so you'd better speed up.

27
00:02:21,982 --> 00:02:24,188
蹲下
Sh. Get down. Get down!

28
00:02:37,205 --> 00:02:39,281
到底在哪里?
(radio) Where are you?

29
00:02:40,751 --> 00:02:42,827
对，什么都没发现
Yeah. I got nothing.

30
00:03:22,042 --> 00:03:24,118
我们可以走了
Sh. We can move.

31
00:03:28,382 --> 00:03:30,090
(vehicle approaches)

32
00:03:30,175 --> 00:03:32,251
等等，到这里来，蹲下
Wait. Come here. Get down.

33
00:03:46,566 --> 00:03:48,939
妈，接下来怎么办?
What are we gonna do, Mom?

34
00:03:49,736 --> 00:03:53,319
我们进退不得 到处都是他们的人
We can't go back, we can't go forward. They're everywhere.

35
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,777
他们从树林拦截
I think... we can catch the road further up

36
00:03:58,778 --> 00:04:00,539
我想我们不能再走这条路了
where it cuts through the woods.

37
00:04:00,622 --> 00:04:02,677
-爹要我们沿着溪床走
- Dad told us to follow the creek bed.

38
00:04:02,678 --> 00:04:04,787
-我们实在别无选择
- We don't really have a choice, do we?

39
00:04:04,876 --> 00:04:07,118
我们往上走，来吧
We'll go up here. Come on.

40
00:04:17,472 --> 00:04:19,679
(ringing tone)

41
00:04:19,766 --> 00:04:22,388
你要联络的用户...
The subscriberyou are trying to reach...

42
00:04:29,484 --> 00:04:32,604
他们胁持杰克家人的地方
Hey. The property where they're holding Jack's family

43
00:04:32,696 --> 00:04:35,946
6个月前就被 一家虚设的公司租出去
was leased six months ago by a company that doesn't exist.

44
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:38,109
我得去查税务资料
I have to go over the tax records.

45
00:04:39,995 --> 00:04:43,945
-你还好吗? -杰克的手机仍然没有回应
- You all right? - Jack's still not answering his cell.

46
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:47,203
他有可能关机 以免响铃引起注意
Well, he could've shut it off to keep it from ringing.

47
00:04:47,294 --> 00:04:50,081
也或许他出了什么事
- Or maybe something's happened to him. - Oh, look.

48
00:04:50,172 --> 00:04:52,841
若说有人会照顾自己 那非杰克莫属
If anybody can take care of himself, it's Jack.

49
00:04:52,924 --> 00:04:55,263
而且作战组很快就会到达
Plus our tactical units should be there soon.

50
00:04:55,264 --> 00:04:57,552
行动由邦迪指挥，他很行的
Bundy's heading up the operation. He's good.

51
00:04:57,638 --> 00:05:01,552
也许你是对的 我应该早点让葛琳参与
Maybe you were right. I should have brought Green in sooner.

52
00:05:01,642 --> 00:05:02,962
因为杰克的家人身陷险境
You let Jack make the call

53
00:05:02,963 --> 00:05:04,893
所以你让他作主
because it was his family on the line.

54
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:07,516
你还能怎么办?
- What could you do? - Yeah.

55
00:05:13,403 --> 00:05:16,250
很抱歉，这件事发生以来
Look, I'm sorry. Since this whole thing

56
00:05:16,251 --> 00:05:19,608
我想我有一点严苛
got started, I guess I've been a little harsh.

57
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:23,824
只是有一点?
A little?

58
00:05:23,914 --> 00:05:26,072
好吧，或许是很严苛
OK, maybe a lot.

59
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:30,294
我一直担心...
I just... I've been afraid, and I...

60
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:32,667
不用解释，好吗?
You don't have to explain. All right?

61
00:05:32,756 --> 00:05:36,090
你想谈我们的事 等过些时候再谈
You wanna talk about us, we'll talk about it later, OK?

62
00:05:36,176 --> 00:05:38,601
-我只要你知道没什么事...
- I just want you to know that it's nothing...

63
00:05:38,602 --> 00:05:40,922
-你带洁美的母亲来了吗?
- You're bringing in Jamey Farrell's mother?

64
00:05:41,014 --> 00:05:42,923
是的，来接 她儿子凯尔
Yes, to pick up Kyle, her son.

65
00:05:43,016 --> 00:05:46,101
在她见到他之前 我要你们先讯问她
Before she sees him, I want the two of you to question her.

66
00:05:46,186 --> 00:05:47,996
如果有对保护派默
If she has information that can help

67
00:05:47,997 --> 00:05:49,556
有利的资讯，我要知情
protect Palmer, I need to know.

68
00:05:49,648 --> 00:05:51,560
-是什么因素让你这么推测?
- What makes you think she has?

69
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:54,275
-4个月前
- $300,000 was deposited in her bank account

70
00:05:54,361 --> 00:05:56,437
有30万存入她的户头
over the last four months.

71
00:06:00,575 --> 00:06:02,920
他们杀了乔治佛拉格摩
(Palmer) They killed George Ferragamo.

72
00:06:02,921 --> 00:06:04,526
这场火灾不是意外
That fire was no accident.

73
00:06:04,621 --> 00:06:07,907
我要先找毛琳谈谈 然后马上去地检署
I wanna talk to Maureen Kingsley, then go right to the DA.

74
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,036
等到事实弄清楚再去
Wait until you have the facts before you go off.

75
00:06:11,128 --> 00:06:14,164
事实?佛拉格摩被杀 好让我当选
The facts? Ferragamo was killed so I could get elected.

76
00:06:14,256 --> 00:06:16,332
-你并不知实情啊 -那又如何?
- You don't know that. - Then what?

77
00:06:16,425 --> 00:06:19,509
我只是说，在任何行动以前
I'm just saying, let's take a beat, see how

78
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:22,594
要静观其变，谋定而动
we should play this, before we do anything.

79
00:06:22,681 --> 00:06:24,970
只有一条路可以走 麦克
There's only one way to play this, Mike.

80
00:06:25,058 --> 00:06:28,344
毛琳终究会捞到 她从业以来的大新闻
Maureen Kingsley will get the story of her career after all.

81
00:06:28,437 --> 00:06:31,188
在找毛琳谈过后 我就去地检署
- David... - And after I talk to her I wanna see the DA.

82
00:06:31,273 --> 00:06:32,933
-你不跟雪莉商量吗?
- Shouldn't you run this by Sherry?

83
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,974
-怎么?好让她说服我?
- Why? So she can try to talk me out of it?

84
00:06:35,068 --> 00:06:36,825
她是你老婆
She's your wife, David.

85
00:06:36,826 --> 00:06:40,111
这也是她的生活，她有权知道
This is her life too. She deserves to know.

86
00:06:46,371 --> 00:06:48,110
-营区撤干净了没?
- Has the compound been cleared?

87
00:06:48,111 --> 00:06:50,121
-好了，但计划有些改变
- Yes. There's been a change of plan.

88
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:53,827
-意思是? -鲍尔如我所料的找上门来
- Meaning? - Bauer showed up here like I said he would.

89
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,455
-捉到他了吗? -还没有，但我会的
- You have him? - Not yet, but I will.

90
00:06:58,884 --> 00:07:01,462
恭喜你，艾拉
Congratulations, lra.You may have

91
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,962
你为自己创造了另一次机会
bought yourself a second chance.

92
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:06,604
契约规定是刺杀派默
My contract included killing Palmer.

93
00:07:06,605 --> 00:07:08,304
我要事情做得完美
I wanna make good on it.

94
00:07:08,393 --> 00:07:10,832
听起来，你似乎已经
The way you were talking, it sounded like

95
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,855
把这件事交给别人处理
you handed it off to someone else.

96
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:17,518
杀了鲍尔 然后我们再来谈参议员
Bring me Bauer's body. Then we'll talk about the senator.

97
00:07:17,945 --> 00:07:20,899
我很快就会给你好消息
You'll hear from me soon.

98
00:07:23,617 --> 00:07:25,989
Drazen?

99
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:30,490
我们要不杀了鲍尔 要不就毁了我们自己
Yeah. Either we eliminate Bauer or Drazen eliminates us.

100
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:34,826
-这是唯一的选择? -基本上是的
- And that's the only option here? - Basically.

101
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,541
干掉鲍尔并不容易
Getting Bauer's not as easy as it sounds.

102
00:07:38,465 --> 00:07:40,921
他用手机 对外协调联络
He phoned in some GPS coordinates to somebody.

103
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:42,793
不管他跟谁联络
Whoever that is, I'm sure they're

104
00:07:42,794 --> 00:07:44,794
救兵一定很快就会到达
gonna be calling the cavalry in soon.

105
00:07:44,888 --> 00:07:48,339
我们不如减少损失 赶快离开这鬼地方
I say we just cut our losses and get the hell outta here.

106
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:50,587
光避开他们没有用
You don't just get out with these people.

107
00:07:50,588 --> 00:07:51,638
他们会追捕你
They come after you.

108
00:07:51,728 --> 00:07:53,599
不论躲到哪里
They keep coming until they find you,

109
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,814
不抓到你他们不会停手
no matter where you are.

110
00:07:54,898 --> 00:07:57,436
而一旦他们...
And when they do...

111
00:07:57,526 --> 00:07:59,183
相信我，干掉鲍尔
Believe me, killing Bauer

112
00:07:59,184 --> 00:08:01,571
是我们唯一的生路
is our only chance of staying alive.

113
00:08:39,026 --> 00:08:42,893
她们应该已经到了 过来坐下
They should have been here by now. Come here. Sit down.

114
00:08:42,988 --> 00:08:45,479
小心点
Easy, easy.

115
00:08:45,574 --> 00:08:47,650
让我看一看
Here, let me take a look at it.

116
00:08:50,662 --> 00:08:53,199
好，这会有一阵子刺痛
OK. This is gonna sting for a while,

117
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,456
但你并没有致命的伤势
but you're not mortally wounded.

118
00:08:55,542 --> 00:08:57,393
子弹虽贯穿
The bullet passed straight through.

119
00:08:57,394 --> 00:08:59,457
却没有伤到骨头及大动脉
It didn't hit any bone or major artery.

120
00:08:59,546 --> 00:09:02,547
-有没有不要的衣物? -有，在我后口袋
- You got any loose clothing? - Yeah, in my back pocket.

121
00:09:02,633 --> 00:09:04,709
找到了
I got it.

122
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,586
深呼吸
Take a deep breath.

123
00:09:13,602 --> 00:09:16,472
-等等，停下来，宝贝 -你还好吗?
- Wait. Hold up, honey, hold up. - Are you OK?

124
00:09:16,563 --> 00:09:21,106
没事 我只想确定我们的位置
Yeah, no, I just... I just wanna check where we are. We...

125
00:09:22,653 --> 00:09:25,205
我们可能有点偏南
We... we may have veered a little south,

126
00:09:25,206 --> 00:09:27,695
但应该会碰到一条道路
but we should have hit the road by now.

127
00:09:33,497 --> 00:09:36,202
我找不到 你那边看得到吗?
I can't see it. Do you see it up ahead?

128
00:09:37,626 --> 00:09:39,998
你不清楚我们在哪 对不对?
You don't know where we are, do you?

129
00:09:42,422 --> 00:09:44,498
Mom.

130
00:09:46,301 --> 00:09:49,421
我们迷路了，是不是?
We're lost, aren't we?

131
00:09:49,513 --> 00:09:51,755
不是
No.

132
00:09:51,848 --> 00:09:54,386
我们应该直走
We should just go straight.

133
00:09:54,476 --> 00:09:57,181
-应该就在前面 -你确定吗?
- It should be just up ahead. - Are you sure?

134
00:10:13,787 --> 00:10:16,539
这有助于止血
That'll help stop the bleeding.

135
00:10:19,918 --> 00:10:21,994
很好
That's good.

136
00:10:32,097 --> 00:10:34,766
麦克是你的顾问 他有何意见?
Mike's your advisor. What's his advice?

137
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:41,686
他同意我的看法
He agrees with me.

138
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:46,351
他认为你试图接受挑战 是一个错误
He thinks you're making a mistake by trying to take them on.

139
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:48,904
-他们已掩饰了一个人的死
- They've already covered up one death.

140
00:10:48,905 --> 00:10:51,238
-你并不知医生到底怎么了
- No, you don't know about Ferragamo.

141
00:10:55,954 --> 00:10:58,030
但即使你是对的
But even if you're right,

142
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:02,478
让媒体炒作此事
will turning this into a media circus

143
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:03,916
就会让他起死回生吗?
bring him back to life?

144
00:11:04,004 --> 00:11:09,295
-那不是重点 -你的事业，你的家庭
- That's not the point. - Your career. And your family.

145
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,303
你在放弃一切成果
You're... you're throwing away everything you've built

146
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,842
在缺乏事实 明确证据的情形下
without any hard evidence of what really happened.

147
00:11:18,936 --> 00:11:21,012
警方会找到证据的
The police will find the evidence.

148
00:11:21,104 --> 00:11:26,977
不，他们找不到的 因为卡尔跟他的老板
No. They won't, because Carl and the people he works for,

149
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:31,280
将会操控行政体系 达到他们的目的
they will twist the system to get the result that they want.

150
00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:34,525
那是他们的生存之道 大卫
That's what they do, David.

151
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,820
而你将一无所有
And you'll be left with nothing.

152
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:49,505
亲爱的，你要有权力 才能跟他们对抗
Sweetheart, to fight these people you need power.

153
00:11:52,135 --> 00:11:57,556
一旦你当了总统 你便拥有这样的权力
The kind of power you'll have once you become president.

154
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,166
一开始我们就知道
We knew from the start

155
00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:08,309
这是一场艰难的竞赛
that this was going to be an uphill race.

156
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:12,855
但我们 快要成功了
But we're almost there.

157
00:12:14,116 --> 00:12:16,192
看看民调
Look at the polls.

158
00:12:21,623 --> 00:12:24,909
-雪莉，我想不通 -不，想想看，大卫
- Sherry, I don't know. - No. Think, David, think.

159
00:12:31,008 --> 00:12:34,339
一旦你赢得候选资格
Think of the millions of lives you can

160
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:37,758
你就能改善多少人民的生活
make better once you win the candidacy.

161
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,966
我自己都不守法
How can I do the job

162
00:12:42,352 --> 00:12:44,428
我哪有资格担此重任?
when my own house isn't in order?

163
00:12:47,858 --> 00:12:49,934
David.

164
00:12:59,286 --> 00:13:01,475
我叫她们在水塔等我们
I told them to wait for us here at the water

165
00:13:01,476 --> 00:13:03,665
你有听到，对不对?
tower. You heard me say that, right? Dammit.

166
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:07,082
-你打算怎么办? -我得回去找她们
- What are you gonna do? - I gotta go back and find 'em.

167
00:13:10,964 --> 00:13:12,791
- Green. - It's Jack.

168
00:13:12,883 --> 00:13:15,884
-情况很混乱 -说给我听
- There's been a complication. - I'm listening.

169
00:13:15,969 --> 00:13:18,160
泰莉跟琴并未到会合地点
Teri and Kim are not where they should be.

170
00:13:18,161 --> 00:13:19,256
我要去找她们
I've gotta find them.

171
00:13:19,348 --> 00:13:21,839
我得让救援队知道 去哪里接应你们
I need to let the team know where to pick you up.

172
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,807
告诉他们到营区的北区
Tell them to meet us at a water tower,

173
00:13:23,808 --> 00:13:25,138
有个水塔的地点碰头
north area of the compound.

174
00:13:25,228 --> 00:13:28,644
查看卫星照片 就在蓄水池上方
Check your satellite photos. It's overlooking a reservoir.

175
00:13:28,732 --> 00:13:30,772
若救援队抵达而我还没回来
Alberta, if I'm not back when the team

176
00:13:30,773 --> 00:13:33,027
他们会找到一个男孩
arrives, they're gonna find a kid in here.

177
00:13:33,111 --> 00:13:36,065
-名叫瑞克，他受伤了 -他是谁?
- His name is Rick. He's wounded. - Who is he?

178
00:13:36,156 --> 00:13:38,149
帮我们逃走的人
Someone who helped us get out of there.

179
00:13:38,241 --> 00:13:41,326
-三个作战队正在途中 -还有多久会到?
- Three tactical units are on their way. - How much longer?

180
00:13:41,411 --> 00:13:44,163
-10分钟，最多15分钟 -好，我知道了
- 10 minutes. 15, tops. - OK, I copy. Out.

181
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,498
- Jack. - What?

182
00:13:48,585 --> 00:13:50,744
谢谢你
Thanks.

183
00:13:50,837 --> 00:13:53,542
不用谢我 去谢我女儿
Don't thank me. Thank my daughter.

184
00:13:54,591 --> 00:13:57,082
整件事情 我完全不清楚
This whole thing, I had no idea what was going on.

185
00:13:57,177 --> 00:13:58,678
丹说我们只是要
Dan said we were just scaring

186
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:00,594
吓唬一些不守信用的家伙
some guys who'd backed out of a deal.

187
00:14:00,681 --> 00:14:03,066
当你发现不对劲的时候
Yeah, well, when you started to see what was

188
00:14:03,067 --> 00:14:05,344
就应当采取一些行动
happening, you should have done something.

189
00:14:05,435 --> 00:14:07,843
但他是我的朋友
He was my friend.

190
00:14:07,938 --> 00:14:10,249
你挟持了我女儿
Hey, you kidnapped my daughter.

191
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,933
这件事会让你永生难忘
You're gonna have to live with that.

192
00:14:16,863 --> 00:14:18,763
孩子，想要重新得到机会
Son, part of getting a second chance

193
00:14:18,764 --> 00:14:20,031
首先必须
is taking responsibility

194
00:14:20,117 --> 00:14:24,031
为你所做的一切负起责任 你明白吗?
for the mess you made in the first place, you understand me?

195
00:14:24,746 --> 00:14:27,237
那好，我很快就回来
Good. I'll be back in a few minutes.

196
00:14:50,939 --> 00:14:52,564
(radio)

197
00:15:02,951 --> 00:15:05,150
也许我们可以在卫星照片上
That shack over there. Maybe we can

198
00:15:05,151 --> 00:15:07,413
比对那个小木屋，找出方位
find it on this to see where we are.

199
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:14,080
瞧? 我想我们不会偏离太远
See? I don't think we're as far off as I thought.

200
00:15:14,171 --> 00:15:16,080
(voices)

201
00:15:16,173 --> 00:15:17,453
Mom!

202
00:15:23,472 --> 00:15:25,548
宝贝，身体压低
Honey, come on. Stay down.

203
00:16:05,681 --> 00:16:07,757
走
(Teri) Go, go.

204
00:16:23,907 --> 00:16:25,983
蹲下
Down. Down.

205
00:16:58,525 --> 00:17:02,393
我是甘恩斯 每个人都去包围第5区
(radio) It's Gaines. Everyone circle back to section five.

206
00:17:18,086 --> 00:17:22,582
当他到小屋后面的时候 我们就走
OK. When he gets to the back of the shed, we'll go.

207
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:24,963
-万一他发现我们呢? -不会有事的
- What if he sees us? - We'll be all right.

208
00:17:25,385 --> 00:17:27,461
-你还好吗? -还好，没什么
- Are you OK? - Yeah, it's nothing.

209
00:17:27,554 --> 00:17:29,371
-妈，你一直这么说，但...

210
00:17:29,372 --> 00:17:31,968
-会没事的，我保证，宝贝
- It's gonna be fine, I promise, honey. It's fine.

211
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:34,514
泰莉，趴下
- Mom! - Teri, stay down!

212
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:53,028
-你们都没事吧?
- Jack! - Are you both OK?

213
00:17:53,121 --> 00:17:54,699
-没事 -过来
- Yeah. - Come here.

214
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:57,707
我是甘恩斯 是谁在开枪?
(radio) This is Gaines. Who's shooting?

215
00:17:59,503 --> 00:18:02,208
不管谁开枪 立刻报出你的位置
Whoever's shooting, call in your position now!

216
00:18:02,297 --> 00:18:04,434
他们马上就蜂拥而至
Dammit! They're gonna swarm this place.

217
00:18:04,435 --> 00:18:05,750
我们快走
We gotta get outta here.

218
00:18:05,842 --> 00:18:07,835
-瑞克呢?他还好吗? -他没事
- Where's Rick? Is he OK? - He's fine.

219
00:18:07,928 --> 00:18:10,170
-他在哪儿? -在水塔待援
- Where is he? - Waiting at the water tower.

220
00:18:10,264 --> 00:18:11,720
反恐组已派了直升机
CTU's sending a chopper.

221
00:18:11,721 --> 00:18:13,965
我们要快点走，先等一下
We gotta get outta here now. Hold on.

222
00:18:18,355 --> 00:18:20,606
现在安全，我们要快
OK, come on, it's clear. Come on,

223
00:18:20,607 --> 00:18:23,267
没什么时间了
we gotta move. We don't have much time.

224
00:18:54,224 --> 00:18:56,798
你好，瓦丝奇太太 谢谢你来
Hello, Mrs Vasquez. Thank you for coming in.

225
00:18:56,893 --> 00:18:58,894
-他们说我可以来接孙子
- They said I could pick up my grandson.

226
00:18:58,895 --> 00:19:00,346
-我们很快会带你去接他
- We'll take you to him soon.

227
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,509
-首先我们有问题想请教你
- First we wanna ask you a few questions.

228
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,974
-我也有一个疑问
- Yes, I have a question too.

229
00:19:04,067 --> 00:19:06,370
一个女人流血至死
How can a woman bleed to death,

230
00:19:06,371 --> 00:19:08,896
怎么会无人闻问呢?
and nobody does anything about it?

231
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:14,858
这事我们很抱歉 瓦丝奇太太
We're sorry about Jamey, Mrs Vasquez.

232
00:19:15,579 --> 00:19:18,070
但事实并非如你所想
But it wasn't like that.

233
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,745
我女儿确实死了 不是吗?
My daughter's dead, isn't she?

234
00:19:25,213 --> 00:19:28,582
请带我去见凯尔
Please... take me to Kyle.

235
00:19:28,675 --> 00:19:31,083
我们务必 要问你一些问题
We really do have to ask you a few questions.

236
00:19:31,178 --> 00:19:34,713
我对你的问题没兴趣
- I'm not interested in your questions. - Mrs Vasquez.

237
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,551
你女儿是个叛国者
Your daughter was a traitor.

238
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:44,809
她死前已经招认
- What? - She confessed before she died.

239
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,724
而如果你隐瞒实情
And if you withhold information,

240
00:19:48,725 --> 00:19:50,905
会因涉嫌共犯遭到逮捕
you can be held as an accomplice.

241
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,027
要是如此 那么谁来照顾凯尔?
If that happens, who's gonna take care of Kyle?

242
00:20:05,921 --> 00:20:08,376
你们想知道些什么?
What do you want to know?

243
00:20:08,465 --> 00:20:12,249
国税局资料显示 你年薪4万5千元
lRS records show you earn $45,000 a year.

244
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:15,154
但有个你名下的户头显示
But an account in your name shows a series

245
00:20:15,155 --> 00:20:18,099
一连串总共超过30万的存款
of deposits adding up to more than $300,000.

246
00:20:22,104 --> 00:20:25,354
是洁美存的
It's... It's from Jamey.

247
00:20:27,776 --> 00:20:30,027
这样凯尔才有足够的钱
So that Kyle would have enough money

248
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:32,154
万一洁美发生意外的话
in case something happened to her.

249
00:20:32,239 --> 00:20:34,730
谁给洁美这笔钱?
Who gave Jamey the money?

250
00:20:37,244 --> 00:20:39,913
-她从未提起 -而你也从没问过?
- She never said. - And you never asked?

251
00:20:41,081 --> 00:20:43,046
这些钱全部在你户头
All this money in your account, and

252
00:20:43,047 --> 00:20:45,293
你一次都没问过它的来源?
you never once asked where it came from?

253
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:49,997
凯尔需要你
Kyle needs you.

254
00:20:50,966 --> 00:20:53,373
别做出任何不利于此的事
Don't do anything to jeopardise that.

255
00:21:01,518 --> 00:21:04,135
麦克顿跟尼尔，只有你们
Maxton and Neill, you're the only two who

256
00:21:04,136 --> 00:21:06,561
还没回报，你们在哪里?
haven't checked in yet. Where are you?

257
00:21:06,648 --> 00:21:08,973
再呼叫一次 麦克顿跟尼尔
One more time. Maxton and Neill.

258
00:21:11,653 --> 00:21:12,621
-我是麦克顿
- This is Maxton.

259
00:21:12,622 --> 00:21:15,070
-你们在哪里?为何不回应?
- Where are you? Why haven't you called in?

260
00:21:15,157 --> 00:21:17,042
我们正穿过溪床
We're crossing the creek bed,

261
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:20,033
要到小路拦截鲍尔
trying to cut off Bauer from the service road.

262
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,290
你们持续泄漏方位就甭想
Not if you keep telling me where you are.

263
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:23,455
把掌上电脑给我
Give me the PalmPilot.

264
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,427
只剩尼尔尚未回报
Neill is the only one who hasn't called in.

265
00:21:26,428 --> 00:21:29,046
麦克顿，尼尔巡逻那一区?
Maxton, what area was Neill patrolling?

266
00:21:29,129 --> 00:21:31,565
溪床的最北面
Uh... the northeast side ofthe creek.

267
00:21:31,566 --> 00:21:33,080
他是单独行动
He split offon his own.

268
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,131
好，他们马上赶过去
OK. They're coming from over there.

269
00:21:36,219 --> 00:21:38,950
我们可往下一点抵达小路
We can hit the road down a little farther,

270
00:21:38,951 --> 00:21:40,966
完全躲开他们，走
avoid them completely. Come on.

271
00:21:47,689 --> 00:21:50,464
毛琳，别逼我找旅馆警卫
Maureen? Don't make me get hotel security.

272
00:21:50,465 --> 00:21:51,984
我知道你在里面
I know you're in there.

273
00:22:02,412 --> 00:22:04,293
-你为何不见我?
- Why are you shutting me out?

274
00:22:04,294 --> 00:22:07,241
-我想该谈的都谈完了
- I think we've said everything we need to say.

275
00:22:07,334 --> 00:22:09,410
我至少可以进来吧?
Can I at least come in?

276
00:22:11,672 --> 00:22:15,337
毛琳 拜开门让我进来
Maureen, please. Open the door and let me in.

277
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:27,726
我知道我曾要求你 别报导我儿子的事
I know I asked you to back off the story about my son.

278
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:30,723
但我改变主意
But I've changed my mind.

279
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:35,268
佛拉格摩医师已经死了
Dr Ferragamo's dead.

280
00:22:38,448 --> 00:22:41,070
-你早已知情 -我不想再听
- You already knew. - I don't wanna hear any more.

281
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:43,318
什么意思你不想听?
What do you mean, you don't wanna hear it?

282
00:22:43,412 --> 00:22:45,950
-我已经离开电视台 -什么?
- I've left the network. - What?

283
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:50,083
-什么时候? -你也应该放手不管
- When? - You should leave it alone too.

284
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:53,753
那是我以朋友身份 给你的忠告
That's my advice. As a friend.

285
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:58,417
他们找上你
They got to you.

286
00:22:59,219 --> 00:23:01,425
他们付你钱了吗?
Did they pay you off?

287
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:05,096
因为我不认为 你会为了钱出卖自己
Because I wouldn't have thought you were for sale.

288
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:15,609
他们也威胁了你
They threatened you too.

289
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:19,398
-我会派人保护你 -我已经保护自己了
- I'll see that you're protected. - I have protected myself.

290
00:23:19,489 --> 00:23:22,823
毛琳，你在隐瞒 重大罪案的证据
Maureen. You're withholding evidence in a capital crime.

291
00:23:22,909 --> 00:23:26,990
什么证据? 佛拉格摩医师都死了
What evidence? Dr Ferragamo is dead.

292
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,156
他的档案也毁了
His files have been destroyed.

293
00:23:29,249 --> 00:23:31,875
-但有基斯笔迹的文件...
- But the piece of paper with Keith's writing...

294
00:23:31,876 --> 00:23:33,462
-没有那文件
- There is no piece of paper.

295
00:23:35,297 --> 00:23:38,132
再也没有了
Not any more.

296
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:41,336
我仍然是这么认为 这样做是有意义的
There's still my word. It counts for something.

297
00:23:42,596 --> 00:23:44,672
光有意义不够 参议员
It's not enough, Senator.

298
00:23:46,433 --> 00:23:48,805
对那些人来说 是没用的
Not against these people.

299
00:23:53,315 --> 00:23:55,888
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

300
00:24:26,807 --> 00:24:30,223
-没有无线电话机 -鲍尔一直在监听着
- There's no radio. - Bauer's been listening.

301
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:32,386
我们每一句该死的话
To every damn word!

302
00:24:35,148 --> 00:24:38,482
1月份以后，瓦丝奇太太 曾收到两笔电汇
Mrs Vasquez has received two wire transfers since January.

303
00:24:38,568 --> 00:24:40,325
都从一家在贝尔格勒
Both from a holding company

304
00:24:40,326 --> 00:24:42,733
叫路卡优尼的股份公司转出
called Luca Univox based in Belgrade.

305
00:24:42,823 --> 00:24:45,148
杰克建议追查 跟贝尔格勒有关的线索
Jack suggested a connection to Belgrade.

306
00:24:45,242 --> 00:24:47,610
-两年前他曾被派往该地
- He was on assignment there two years ago.

307
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:50,035
-你查过跟本案的关联吗?
- Did you check for a connection to the hit?

308
00:24:50,122 --> 00:24:53,039
这些档案 或能给我们新观点
These new files may give us a new angle.

309
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:55,022
在贝尔格勒我们知道有谁
So who do we know in Belgrade

310
00:24:55,023 --> 00:24:57,704
是金融界的关键人物?
who's keyed into the financial community?

311
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:04,585
过来
Come on.

312
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:17,389
你能联络到他们吗?
(Teri) Can you call them?

313
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:21,231
或许吧 直升机现在应该到了
Maybe. The chopper should have been here by now.

314
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,922
-瑞克不跟我们在此会合吗?
- What about Rick? lsn't he meeting us here?

315
00:25:23,923 --> 00:25:25,106
-可恶，没有信号
- Dammit. No signal.

316
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:28,769
瑞克受了伤，他在水塔里面
Rick was wounded. He's in the water tower.

317
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:31,319
当直升机到的时候他会出来
When the chopper arrives, he'll come out.

318
00:25:31,413 --> 00:25:33,406
那我们在等什么?
- So what are we waiting for? - Kim.

319
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:35,745
-至少要让他知道我们在这儿
- Shouldn't he at least know we're here?

320
00:25:35,746 --> 00:25:37,544
-等你爸说安全了才行
- When your father says it's OK.

321
00:25:37,628 --> 00:25:39,869
-爸，这附近没半人 -琴，不行
- There's no one even around. Dad. - Kim, no!

322
00:25:40,422 --> 00:25:42,415
快回来
Get back! Get back!

323
00:25:49,973 --> 00:25:52,643
-是狙击枪 -我们怎么办?
- It's a sniper rifle. - What do we do?

324
00:25:53,936 --> 00:25:56,215
待在这里，除了直升机外
Stay here. Don't move for anything

325
00:25:56,216 --> 00:25:58,764
都不要离开，明白吗?
but the chopper. Do you understand me?

326
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:00,850
-你要去哪里? -他想要抓我
- Where are you going? - He wants me.

327
00:26:00,943 --> 00:26:03,019
Jack!

328
00:26:38,522 --> 00:26:41,060
他想要引我们 离开那些女人
He's trying to draw us away from the women.

329
00:26:41,149 --> 00:26:44,353
那很好，他一死 其他的人就简单多了
It's fine by me. Once he's dead, they'll be easy.

330
00:26:44,444 --> 00:26:46,136
我把他钉住，你去抄他
I'll keep him pinned down.

331
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:48,739
给他致命的一击
Circle around till you get a clear shot.

332
00:27:28,989 --> 00:27:31,444
-该死 -没错，杰克
- Dammit. - That's right, Jack.

333
00:27:31,533 --> 00:27:34,154
这么远 超出你的射程
You don't have a shot from that distance.

334
00:27:38,415 --> 00:27:41,369
-我们还有多少时间? -是指什么?
- How much longer do we have? - Until what?

335
00:27:45,005 --> 00:27:47,163
是指你的人马 到达这里
Until your people get here.

336
00:27:47,257 --> 00:27:49,926
我要是你就会快走 而不会坐在那里等
I wouldn't wait around to find out if I were you.

337
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:51,420
我别无选择
I don't have a choice.

338
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:54,305
我的老板交代得很清楚
The people I work for made that pretty clear.

339
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:48,852
(Gaines) Agh!

340
00:29:10,299 --> 00:29:13,050
检察官在里面 要我进去坐吗?
The DA's inside. You want me to sit in?

341
00:29:17,723 --> 00:29:20,392
等我1分钟
Give me a minute.

342
00:29:20,475 --> 00:29:22,764
-长官? -没关系
- Sir? - It's OK.

343
00:29:22,853 --> 00:29:24,929
他在竞选
He's with the campaign.

344
00:29:29,651 --> 00:29:31,503
检察官就在大厅，卡尔
The DA's down the hall, Carl.

345
00:29:31,504 --> 00:29:33,484
他在等我讲一个故事
Waiting for me to tell a story.

346
00:29:35,324 --> 00:29:39,986
-都结束了 -我觉得一切才刚开始
- It's over. - See, and I think it's just getting started.

347
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:45,537
别耍我，大卫
Don't get stupid on me now, David.

348
00:29:45,626 --> 00:29:48,507
-长久以来似乎我才是傻瓜
- It seems I've been stupid for a long time.

349
00:29:48,508 --> 00:29:50,538
-那么就聪明一次
- Then open your eyes for once.

350
00:29:50,631 --> 00:29:54,711
这整件事像个大的机器
This... the whole thing, it's one big machine.

351
00:29:54,801 --> 00:29:57,103
而我是让活塞、发动机
I'm the oil that keeps the pistons pumping,

352
00:29:57,104 --> 00:29:59,299
和车轮运转无碍的机油
the motor turning, the wheels spinning...

353
00:29:59,389 --> 00:30:01,596
再也不是了
Not any more.

354
00:30:01,683 --> 00:30:04,221
我喜欢你，大卫，真的
I like you, David. I really do.

355
00:30:04,311 --> 00:30:08,391
而且我认为你将成为 全国最高统帅
And I think you would make one hell of a commander in chief.

356
00:30:08,482 --> 00:30:11,602
我知道你 对佛拉格摩干的好事
I know what you did to Ferragamo.

357
00:30:11,693 --> 00:30:13,611
每个引擎总有损耗
Every engine produces waste.

358
00:30:13,612 --> 00:30:15,941
那是情势的必然
It's the physics of the situation.

359
00:30:17,407 --> 00:30:20,527
-听听看你说些什么 -两者间做个考虑吧
- Listen to yourself. - Consider the alternatives.

360
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:23,636
从现在起1年内
A year from now, you'll either be promoting

361
00:30:23,637 --> 00:30:25,531
你不是为国家向前迈进
your agenda for the nation,

362
00:30:25,624 --> 00:30:27,866
就是到监狱去看你儿子
or visiting your son in prison.

363
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,116
-陪审团会相信那是个意外
- A jury will believe that it was an accident.

364
00:30:31,117 --> 00:30:33,999
-我不是指那个强奸犯，大卫
- I'm not talking about the rapist, David.

365
00:30:34,091 --> 00:30:37,008
我是在说佛拉格摩医师
I'm talking about Dr Ferragamo.

366
00:30:38,512 --> 00:30:40,650
-基斯跟佛拉格摩无关
- Keith had nothing to do with Ferragamo.

367
00:30:40,651 --> 00:30:41,798
-当然他不相干
- Of course he didn't.

368
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:46,636
但如果有人提到 "纵火"这个字...
But if somebody were to mention the word "arson"...

369
00:30:52,192 --> 00:30:54,268
你这个混蛋！
You son of a bitch!

370
00:30:56,071 --> 00:30:58,229
你栽了什么赃?
You planted something?

371
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:00,644
我们共同效力的那些人，大卫
The people we both work for, David,

372
00:31:00,645 --> 00:31:03,033
他们懂得如何遂其所愿
they know how to get what they want.

373
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:16,002
嗨，麦克
Hi, Mike.

374
00:31:22,889 --> 00:31:25,048
一切是怎么回事?
What was that all about?

375
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:34,556
检察官在那里等着 你要我怎么说?
The DA's waiting in there. What do you want me to say?

376
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:39,855
告诉他我很抱歉
Tell him I'm sorry.

377
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:42,905
我没什么事跟他说
I have nothing to say.

378
00:31:42,993 --> 00:31:45,151
我犯了个错误
I made a mistake.

379
00:31:45,245 --> 00:31:47,819
我听不懂
I don't understand.

380
00:31:47,914 --> 00:31:50,073
我正在竞选总统 麦克
I'm running for president, Mike.

381
00:31:52,044 --> 00:31:54,713
而且我将会当选
And I'm gonna win.

382
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:29,572
在这里
- Hey! - Over here!

383
00:32:29,665 --> 00:32:31,741
Hey!

384
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,626
等等
Wait.

385
00:32:53,063 --> 00:32:57,524
联邦探员，放下武器 把手举起来
Federal agent! Drop your weapons! Put your hands in the air!

386
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:59,068
-鲍尔太太吗? -我是
- Mrs Bauer? - Yes!

387
00:32:59,152 --> 00:33:00,663
把手放下，你或你女儿
Put your hands down. Do you

388
00:33:00,664 --> 00:33:02,902
需要医疗照护吗?
or your daughter need medical attention?

389
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,947
-不用，但我先生... -他在哪里?
- No, but my husband... - Where is he?

390
00:33:05,033 --> 00:33:07,489
-我不清楚，就在这附近 -出发
- I don't know. He's somewhere up there. - Go!

391
00:33:08,036 --> 00:33:09,530
跟我来
Come on.

392
00:33:15,752 --> 00:33:18,243
跟在后面
Stay back.

393
00:33:18,338 --> 00:33:19,252
Kim!

394
00:33:19,339 --> 00:33:21,877
-鲍尔太太，等一下！ -没有关系
- Mrs Bauer, wait! - It's all right. Kim!

395
00:33:23,885 --> 00:33:26,590
琴，别去
Kim! Kimberly, stop. Kim!

396
00:33:27,931 --> 00:33:29,046
Kim.

397
00:33:32,269 --> 00:33:35,021
-爹说他在这里，他人呢?
- Dad said he'd be in here. Where is he?

398
00:33:35,022 --> 00:33:37,430
-不管在哪里，他们会找到他
- Wherever he is, they'll find him.

399
00:33:37,524 --> 00:33:39,849
-万一甘恩斯找到他呢? -他会死
- What if Gaines found him? - He'd be dead.

400
00:33:39,943 --> 00:33:43,312
他们会用装尸袋 带他离开
They'd be carrying him outta here in a body bag.

401
00:33:43,405 --> 00:33:45,985
-他在这里，我得找到他
- No. He's gotta be here. I gotta find him.

402
00:33:45,986 --> 00:33:47,486
-快别这样，琴
- Just stop it, Kimberly.

403
00:33:48,118 --> 00:33:49,675
我知道你关心这个男孩
I know you care about this boy,

404
00:33:49,676 --> 00:33:51,535
但我现在需要你在这里
but I need you to be here for me now,

405
00:33:51,622 --> 00:33:54,658
而你爸需要我们 两个都在这里
and your dad needs both of us to be there for him.

406
00:34:49,846 --> 00:34:51,922
你正在流血
You're losing blood.

407
00:34:55,143 --> 00:34:58,144
还不足以阻止我杀你
Not enough to stop me from killing you.

408
00:34:59,648 --> 00:35:02,139
或许我俩都不必死
(Jack) Maybe neither ofus has to die.

409
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:07,441
就像我所说的，杰克 我别无选择
Like I said, Jack, I don't have that choice.

410
00:35:10,951 --> 00:35:14,569
那至少你可以 告诉我到底怎么回事
Then maybe at least you can tell me what's going on.

411

可菲 他曾提到贝尔格勒

那是个军事行动
That was a military operation.

413
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,796
派默怎会跟它有关?
How's Palmer connected to that?

Neither do I. The less I know, the better I can do my job.

那就是我们这一行的本质
That'sjust the nature of our business.

那为何 要牵扯到我的家人?

那也许是个误会
That might have been a mistake.

420

他们只是要针对个人
They wanted to make it personal.

421
00:36:20,687 --> 00:36:22,763
"他们"是谁?
