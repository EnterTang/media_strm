1
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:11,298
Please help me!

2
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:13,884
I can't move!

3
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,015
Help me! I can't move!

4
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:21,391
Oh my god!

5
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,919
Sarah, save what you're doing and log out. I need you on something now.

6
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:31,712
What is it?

7
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,797
I just heard from one of our sources.

8
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:38,510
There's a high probability that someone from our FBI watchlist was spotted in L.A. yesterday.

9
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,182
Thomas Sharek. Who is he?

10
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,185
He's done work with several terrorist cells outside Istanbul.

11
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,685
coordinating several suicide bombings last summer.

12
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:50,984
Istanbul...

13
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:55,487
There was some chatter this morning about a possible attack by a group out of Turkey.

14
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,488
Here it is. From Ankarah.

15
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,407
What was the target?

16
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,492
East Coast. New York or D.C.

17
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,203
But the time window passed.

18
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:04,912
Passed?

19
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:08,207
The targetted time was for 8 A.M. It's already past 10 on the East Coast.

20
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,920
What if they got the target wrong and it's West Coast time?

21
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,797
Then it's gonna go down within the hour.

22
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,512
Tell Curtis, I'll take this to Driscoll.

23
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:22,596
I can take it to her.

24
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,597
Why?

25
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,682
I thought you wanted to keep working it up.

26
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:29,019
You know, you're really transparent, Sarah. Stop trying to be Driscoll' pet,

27
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,103
she doesn't like it.

28
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,402
Have you had voice confirmation from anyone on the train?

29
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,113
No, the signal has just confirmed a bomb.

30
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,990
We're trying to get in contact now.

31
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,910
It's in a remote area but local police are heading to the scene.

32
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,411
Alright.

33
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,790
We have discretionary authority out of Point Magoo.

34
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,501
Have them direct one of their patrol aircraft over the area.

35
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,503
Put the pilot in contact with our people.

36
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:56,505
Should we monitor emergency services?

37
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,590
No, County will cover that.

38
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:05,389
A truck loaded with C4 just derailed a train in Santa Clarita.

39
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:08,016
Free up some of your people. Division's gonne send over data.

40
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,519
That could be realted to what we just found downstairs.

41
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:11,395
What did you found?

42
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,107
Two things. First, there was intelligence indicating the possibility of an attack

43
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,608
at 8 o'clock this morning.

44
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,486
Bombing was at 7. That's within an hour of the time.

45
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,405
What's the second thing?

46
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,700
A turkish national ont the FBI watchlist by the name of Thomas Sharek

47
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:27,995
was last seen in the city.He could be related to the bombing.

48
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,996
Okay.

49
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:32,416
Open up channels with Divison. Start investigating this bombing.

50
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,418
And work up what you have on Sharek.

51
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:36,420
We'll brief in a few minutes.

52
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,883
What about the Defence Department meeting? It's in a half hour.

53
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:43,385
Who's secretary Heller sending?

54
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,387
Jack Bauer.

55
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:48,307
Jack... You sure?

56
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,017
Yeah, he hasn't been back...

57
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,019
well, since you fired him.

58
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:06,700
Is it gonna be uncomfortable?

59
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:07,993
What?

60
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,580
Going back to CTU. Seeing Driscoll again.

61
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,790
I don't blampe her for her decision.

62
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:16,710
How can that be? She forced you out of CTU.

63
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:21,089
She didn't want a junky on her staff. That's not unreasonable.

64
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:24,593
You weren't a junky. You were doing youre job.

65
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,720
I was addicted to heroin.

66
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:29,389
It didn't matter why.

67
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,809
Do you miss your old job?

68
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:36,813
I could have joined other agencies if I Still wanted to do field work.

69
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,192
But I didn't.

70
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,409
I wanted something different for my life.

71
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:14,685
It might not seem like a lot to you.

72
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:17,980
But for me,

73
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:22,985
to be able to have this kind of connections.

74
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,404
I couldn't do that before.

75
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,494
I'm glad you can now.

76
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:40,294
We'd better go.

77
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:41,587
Yeah.

78
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,715
Secretary Heller is gonna be in the lobby in 5 minutes.

79
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:46,884
Secretary Heller?

80
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:49,720
Yeah, I called him Dad once in a press conference

81
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:52,890
so I decided then to use his title all the time.

82
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:54,516
Audrey.

83
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:58,312
Your father is a very perceptive man.

84
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,982
I would like to tell him about us before he finds out on his own.

85
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,400
Look...

86
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:08,280
My Dad is kind of old-fashioned.

87
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,991
Even though Paul and I are separated, he...

88
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,993
he still considers us married.

89
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,620
I understand that.

90
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:17,080
And I don't want your father to draw the wrong conclusion

91
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:20,501
and think that I had anything to do with the break-up between you and Paul.

92
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,503
Yeah, but you didn't.

93
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,588
Please Jack.

94
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,382
Let's just give it a little more time.

95
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:33,388
I'm gonna tell you something and I don't want you to pannick.

96
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:39,394
I'm falling in love with you.

97
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:41,813
Look, I dont want you to say anything.

98
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:46,318
And I don't need you to feel the same way.

99
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:49,613
I just wanted you to know.

100
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:59,998
I will see you downstairs.

101
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,393
Alright.

102
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,895
Here is what we have:

103
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,398
a known terrorist named Thomas Sharek

104
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,608
managed through the country undetected.

105
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:31,488
We  believe there's a likelyhood Sharek helped organized the train attack in Santa Clarita.

106
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:32,614
If  he did,

107
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:34,700
he's gonna get out of the country as fast as he can.

108
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:37,995
Which means we have a small window of opportunity here.

109
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:40,497
Who's covering airport and costumes?

110
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:41,582
I am.

111
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:44,418
I've issued a mandate to LAX, Long Beach and Ontario.

112
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,295
As usual, we can't hear you.

113
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:48,380
Also, where's your labtop in case you need to pull data?

114
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,215
I'm sorry I'm speak up and

115
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:53,010
I don't need my labtop, I have everything memorized.

116
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:58,390
What I was saying is that I have contacted all the airports and security.

117
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,184
Do we have any local contacts with Sharek?

118
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:01,894
We're looking into those now.

119
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:02,811
Alright.

120
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:05,814
Promote everything we receive up to Division.

121
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:07,900
Let's find Sharek before he leaves the city.

122
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:08,984
Let's go.

123
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,697
Excuse me, Mrs Driscoll. Don't you think it's a mistake

124
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,283
to assume that Sharek is on his way out of L.A.?

125
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:17,117
No.

126
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:19,620
But the timing on the intel doesn't quite match.

127
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:22,915
It said 8 A.M. and the train bombing happened around 7.

128
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:25,584
Just focus on finding Sharek.

129
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:31,882
Yes?

130
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:33,091
It's Thomas.

131
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:35,010
Did Dar get the briefcase ?

132
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:36,011
Yes.

133
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,096
- He's on his radio now.
- Good.

134
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,806
You did well Thomas.

135
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,600
What about Maris ?

136
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:42,893
He's waiting for you.

137
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,520
He has everything you need.

138
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:55,280
Berous, are you eating with us?

139
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:56,990
I'll be right down, mum.

140
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,917
I'm concerned about him.

141
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,919
Concerned? Why?

142
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:12,214
I think he's still seeing this american girl, Debbie.

143
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:13,799
You said you talked to him.

144
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,715
I did.

145
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:17,804
I told him he was no longer allowed to have contact with her.

146
00:11:17,808 --> 00:11:19,517
And he agreed, right?

147
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:25,310
Yes, but I think he's still seeing her behind our backs.

148
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,395
I'll speak to him.

149
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:27,187
No.

150
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:29,898
I'll take care of it.

151
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:42,202
Berous, we're sitting down to eat.

152
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:44,496
Berous?

153
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:45,998
I'm on the phone.

154
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,209
Get off and come down now.

155
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,384
Who was he talking to?

156
00:11:57,593 --> 00:11:58,594
I don't know.

157
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,013
Sorry.

158
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:03,891
Who were you on the phone with?

159
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:05,517
My pal, Scott.

160
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,396
You were talking to that american girl.

161
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:11,899
No, I told you I don't see her anymore.

162
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:14,318
Don't lie to me, Berous.

163
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,986
I hear your phone calls at night.

164
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:17,321
I read your e-mails.

165
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:18,697
You read my e-mails?

166
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,199
That's my business!

167
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:22,993
Don't you raise your voice to your father!

168
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:26,288
While you live under my roof, there's no such thing

169
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:28,498
as your business.

170
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,585
No more communications with that girl.

171
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,712
Do you understand me?

172
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:36,507
Don't look at her you're talking to me.

173
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,302
Yes, sir.

174
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:42,513
...horrible tragedy occured a short time ago.

175
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:44,389
An early morning communer train

176
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,308
collided with a pickup truck

177
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:48,310
that was apparently crossing the track.

178
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:52,314
Most of the passengers were severely injured.

179
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,900
30

180
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:59,112
NTSP have arrived at the scene and are investigating the cause.

181
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:02,908
At this time, the authorities are not saying whether this was an accident

182
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:06,995
or a targetted attack but as you can there has been a...

183
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:10,999
So far, everything is on schedule.

184
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,793
Have yo spoken to Thomas?

185
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,796
Yes, the briefcase is on its way to us now.

186
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:17,297
When it gets here,

187
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,715
you'll take it to the warehouse.

188
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,009
Why doesn't Omar take it directly?

189
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:23,804
He doesn't need to know where our people are working.

190
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:26,014
That's the safest way.

191
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,018
Berous,

192
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,895
if your father seem sevre,

193
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:34,982
it's because our job here is a difficult one.

194
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:36,400
If we are to succeed,

195
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:40,487
it's important that we are of a single mind.

196
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:43,991
I understand.

197
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:50,414
What we will accomplish today will change the world.

198
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:54,418
We're fortunate that our family has been chosen to do this.

199
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,212
We cannot fail.

200
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:02,217
Yes, father.

201
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:28,410
- Morning, Jennifer.
- Morning.

202
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:32,289
What are you doing here so early?

203
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:34,082
I'm not here early.

204
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,001
Been here all night?

205
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,211
Yeah.

206
00:14:38,587 --> 00:14:39,796
What are you working on?

207
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:41,381
Nothing right now.

208
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:44,885
I'm just stealing some software from Adobe and Microsoft.

209
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:47,513
You're gonna get caught one day.

210
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:50,807
Hey, Mel !

211
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:54,311
Don't tell anybody or I'd have to kill you.

212
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,319
What the hell is this?

213
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:15,707
W ow!

214
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,585
Melany, come look at his!

215
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:26,385
Looks like someone's trying corrupt the Internet.

216
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:30,180
Yeah, but it hasn't start propagating yet.

217
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:32,307
They're just placing the nodes.

218
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:35,102
Look at this!

219
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:38,897
This thing could tank every system in the world!

220
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:41,191
You've gotta tell somebody.

221
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:42,609
If I call the Feds from here,

222
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:45,904
they'll trace the call, they'll know I was stealing code.

223
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:47,406
Then do it from a payphone.

224
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:50,200
Yeah.

225
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:04,214
No, i'm up to speed on the train bombing.

226
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:05,591
How many confirmed dead?

227
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,510
I didn't know that.

228
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:10,512
I will. Thanks, Sal.

229
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:11,889
32 dead.

230
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:13,515
What's the initial assessment?

231
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:15,017
An act of terrorism.

232
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:18,604
When you get to CTu, I want you to find out all the details and call me.

233
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:19,104
Yes, sir.

234
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:20,105
And listen,

235
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:24,985
I don't want anyone except the two of you to know about this meeting with Richard.

236
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:25,903
Of course.

237
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,700
I tried to get ahold of you last night. Where were you?

238
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:33,410
I had dinner with a friend.

239
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:35,120
Anyone I know?

240
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:35,996
No.

241
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,502
- Jack.
- Sir.

242
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:45,714
I'll call you when I get to CTU.

243
00:16:57,601 --> 00:16:59,520
Yeah, I'll get it. Hold on.

244
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:03,190
O'Brian.

245
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:04,608
Chloé, it's Edgar Stiles.

246
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:07,194
Edgar, you don"t need to use your last name. You've been here over a month.

247
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,320
- What is it?
- Okay...

248
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:11,698
I've got someone on the other line who says he's a friend of yours and needs to talk to you.

249
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:13,909
- Who, Edgar?
- His name is Andrew Page.

250
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:15,911
- Fine. Put him through.
- Okay.

251
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:17,704
Hello?

252
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:19,998
Andrew, you know I can't take personal calls here.

253
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:21,291
It's not personal.

254
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:24,002
I found something on the net I think you should know about.

255
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:25,212
What?

256
00:17:25,504 --> 00:17:29,216
There's a fake NAT table and several large burped routers.

257
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:30,592
It was loaded this morning.

258
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:31,718
How would you know that?

259
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:35,097
I was trying to download some software and I noticed it.

260
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:39,309
And by download I assume you mean steal. Otherwise you wouldn't even see the NAT table.

261
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:42,688
Okay, fine. But I hacked deeper and I found all kinds of stuff.

262
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:44,106
What kind of stuff?

263
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:48,986
I think someone's positioning code for a major Internet attack.

264
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:52,614
The thing is that not all the code remarks are in English.

265
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:54,199
What language were they in?

266
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:55,200
I don't know.

267
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:59,413
Looked Middle Eastern. Like Arabic or turkish maybe.

268
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:02,291
You find something?

269
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:05,002
Yeah, Cyril's working on the list of known contacts of Sharek.

270
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:09,089
This is Maris Landstraf. He owns a drycleaners in Studio City.

271
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:11,508
We dug into the records and found his business is owned

272
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:13,594
by an holding company based ou t of Ankarah, Turkey.

273
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:14,803
Alright.

274
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:17,806
Give this to Ronnie, tell him to get over there and see what he can find.

275
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:21,310
Excuse me, Mrs. Driscoll.

276
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:22,603
What is it, Chloé?

277
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:25,105
I just got a call from an old classmate, Andrew Page.

278
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:28,609
He noticed that a number of high-profile Internet nodes were compromized.

279
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:30,986
I think this could be related to our present threat.

280
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,196
What makes you say that?

281
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:36,200
A computer network virus was launched this morning from a server somewhere in Turkey.

282
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:37,910
That's where Sharek is from?

283
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:39,411
Should I start working it up?

284
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:41,788
No.

285
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:44,708
The bombing and Sharek are all we should be dealing with now.

286
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:46,418
But pass it to the FBI.

287
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:23,997
Excuse me, sir. Can I help you?

288
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:26,416
Yes I have a scheduled meeting with Erin Driscoll.

289
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,209
Jack!

290
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:29,211
It's okay, Sarah. This is Jack Bauer.

291
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:31,004
Oh! M. Bauer.

292
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:33,006
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's fine.

293
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:35,884
Chloé, how have you been?

294
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:39,012
Not  perfect but okay, I guess. How are Kim and Chase?

295
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:39,888
Good.

296
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:41,598
They just got a house in Valencia.

297
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,600
Kim is taking care of Angela.

298
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,602
Chase is working for a private security company.

299
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:46,687
That's interesting.

300
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:49,690
I mean, I'm interested, I just have to set up a protocol.

301
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,316
Yeah...

302
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:57,114
Jack.

303
00:19:57,489 --> 00:19:58,615
Curtis!

304
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:00,492
Is Erin ready for our meeting?
- Almost.

305
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:03,287
But I should tell you, you're prbably gonna get cut short today.

306
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:04,997
The train bombing in Santa Clarita.

307
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,290
Among other things.

308
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:07,583
What other things ?

309
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,293
I wouldn't worry with it.

310
00:20:09,418 --> 00:20:10,419
We're out.

311
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:12,504
Okay, we'll have you in voice 3, data 4.

312
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:14,590
- Alright.
- Ronnie, this is Jack Bauer.

313
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:15,799
Jack, Ronnie Mabel.

314
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:17,384
- Nice to meet you.
- Hey, Jack.

315
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:19,720
Ronnie's got your old job, head of field ops.

316
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,180
Yeah, I know. How's it going?

317
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:24,308
It's busy. Nice meeting you.

318
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:27,186
Look, would you rather reschedule this?

319
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:28,312
No, it won't be necessary.

320
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:29,980
Erin will be free in a couple minutes.

321
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:30,898
I'll tell you what.

322
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:32,900
What don't you use the station?

323
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:34,109
Make any calls.

324
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:36,612
- It won't be long.
- Okay. Thank you.

325
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:04,014
I don't know, Max. Let me find out.

326
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:06,808
I'm on with a representant from Vandemburg.

327
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:08,519
He wants to know how long he'll be pushed back today.

328
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:11,104
Don't change anything with Vandemburg.

329
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,190
We'll stick to the original schedule.

330
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:16,109
Okay, Max, yeah. We'll see you then.

331
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,613
Have you spoken with your brother?

332
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:22,616
No, I don't think he even knows I'm coming with you today.

333
00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:25,285
That's probably best that he doesn't.

334
00:21:25,494 --> 00:21:27,204
Alright, I'll stay in the car.

335
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,709
Dad, look...

336
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:36,004
even if Richard does go to this protest. It's not the end of the world.

337
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,214
It's not a page 1 story.

338
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:41,093
That's not the point. It's an embarassment to me an to the President.

339
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:47,391
What are you gonna say to him?

340
00:21:47,683 --> 00:21:48,892
I have no idea.

341
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:50,519
The thing that gets to me

342
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:53,105
is that he doesn't know the first thing about the politics of all this.

343
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:55,315
He's just doing it to rebel against you.

344
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:56,984
When did I become the enemy?

345
00:21:57,109 --> 00:21:58,694
- What did I do?
- Nothing!

346
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:02,489
Richard's acting like a spoiled child. He's gonna have to grow up some day.

347
00:22:06,702 --> 00:22:08,203
Audrey Raines.

348
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:09,788
The President is calling for Secretary Heller.

349
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:10,706
Yeah.

350
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:12,291
It's the President's office.

351
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:16,503
Hello.

352
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:18,005
Please hold for the President.

353
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:21,091
- James.
- Yes, Mr. President.

354
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:23,886
James, I'm thinkiong about raising the terror alert level.

355
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:25,596
Because of the train bombing out here ?

356
00:22:25,804 --> 00:22:27,514
No, not just that.

357
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:29,600
Langley has picked up some chatter.

358
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:33,604
We also have intel on some watchlisted individuals who've gotten into the country.

359
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:38,192
Well, my insttinct is to wait until the NTSP waves in on the bombing.

360
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:42,613
In the meantime, we can increase our state of readiness.

361
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:45,199
Alright, I'll take that into consideration.

362
00:22:45,991 --> 00:22:49,494
I'm meeting with the Secretary of State and director Shay in a few minutes.

363
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:51,997
I'll see if they feel the same about it.

364
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:53,790
Yes, Mr. President.

365
00:23:00,297 --> 00:23:01,298
Thank you.

366
00:23:03,884 --> 00:23:04,718
Hello, Erin.

367
00:23:05,511 --> 00:23:06,386
Hello, Jack.

368
00:23:07,513 --> 00:23:09,806
I'm sorry Secretary Heller couldn't be here today.

369
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,099
It's just as well.

370
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,394
As I'm sure you were told, we have a protocol in progress.

371
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:17,397
So, why don't we just go down the items and get it over with?

372
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:18,815
That's fine with me.

373
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:23,111
I'll be direct with you, Jack.

374
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:26,198
I didn't like the budget your boss proposed.

375
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,200
What's the problem?

376
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:33,497
Well, the Department of Defence is asking for 85% of all inter-agency moneys

377
00:23:33,705 --> 00:23:35,707
which is very little for CTU.

378
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:38,585
If you want a bigger piece of the pie, you're gonna have to justify it.

379
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:41,588
I have a proposal for you.

380
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:50,806
You want to use satellite surveillance for all the traffic at the harbor?

381
00:23:50,806 --> 00:23:52,015
Yes. Problem?

382
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:54,101
Yes, it's insufficient.

383
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:55,894
You need to maintain bodies on the ground.

384
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:57,187
Too expensive.

385
00:23:57,312 --> 00:23:59,606
Not if you utilize intelligence from the other agencies.

386
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:03,819
I'm not gonna have Secretary Heller sign off on a budget taht doesn't make sense.

387
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:06,488
I'll  talk to Heller about it myself.

388
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:08,407
No, you'll talk to me.

389
00:24:10,409 --> 00:24:12,202
We're not doing this twice.

390
00:24:13,287 --> 00:24:15,706
Erin, Ronnie has arrived at Landshaff's drycleaners.

391
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:17,082
Where's the feed?

392
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:19,585
It'll be on channel one as soon as he sets the hidden camera.

393
00:24:20,002 --> 00:24:21,086
Excuse me, Jack.

394
00:24:35,184 --> 00:24:36,101
Okay, here we go.

395
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,313
Stand down until I give you order.

396
00:24:39,813 --> 00:24:40,981
Aaron, go round the back.

397
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:42,399
Sean, you go take the side.

398
00:24:56,788 --> 00:24:57,581
Hello?

399
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:01,585
Can I help you?

400
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:03,587
You must be Mr. Landstraf.

401
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:04,713
Do I know you?

402
00:25:04,796 --> 00:25:07,216
My name is Ronnie Labell. I'm with Los Angeles CTU.

403
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:08,717
I need to ask you a few questions.

404
00:25:09,301 --> 00:25:12,012
What do you know about a man named Thomas Sharek?

405
00:25:12,387 --> 00:25:14,181
I don't know this man.

406
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:16,808
Really?

407
00:25:16,892 --> 00:25:19,520
It's in your records that you contacted him in the last few days.

408
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,687
It wasn't me.

409
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,689
I run a legitimate business here.

410
00:25:22,898 --> 00:25:25,192
I never said you business wasn't legitimate, sir.

411
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:27,903
You can't just walk in here and harrass me.

412
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:30,405
He's hiding something.

413
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:32,616
It's beeing handled, Jack.

414
00:25:32,908 --> 00:25:33,909
Erin, listen to me.

415
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:36,703
This store is open for business but the blinds are closed.

416
00:25:36,787 --> 00:25:38,205
There's no other employees.

417
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:41,416
This guys is way too nervous. Trust me. He's hiding something.

418
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:50,092
Turn back a little momment, please.

419
00:25:53,387 --> 00:25:56,515
Says here you open at 6 A.M. Have you been here the entire time?

420
00:25:56,515 --> 00:25:57,516
Yes.

421
00:25:58,684 --> 00:26:00,519
- What's this about?
- Right there.

422
00:26:10,112 --> 00:26:11,488
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.

423
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:13,282
Tell him to look for something on his right.

424
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:14,408
Ronnie.

425
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:18,495
On his right, see if someone could be hiding.

426
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:25,919
Do you mind i I take a look behind that counter?

427
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:30,090
Yes, I do mind. Look, this is my store and I want you to walk ou now.

428
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:32,509
Sir, I'm not walking out of there until I take a look...

429
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:44,479
Jerk!

430
00:26:44,897 --> 00:26:45,814
Got him!

431
00:26:46,899 --> 00:26:47,691
Great job.

432
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,356
Remember, Dad, we're on a tight schedule today.

433
00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:44,581
Richard.

434
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,460
Dad.

435
00:27:52,464 --> 00:27:54,299
- Hello.
- Hey, it's me.

436
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:56,677
Hey. Aren't you supposed to be in your meeting with Driscoll?

437
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,178
Yeah. She had to step away.

438
00:27:58,262 --> 00:28:01,431
Listen, CTU's just picked up a prime suspect in the train bombing.

439
00:28:01,557 --> 00:28:03,475
They're bringing him in for questioning now.

440
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:05,143
My father's still in with Richard.

441
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:07,729
That's all right. I'll brief him later. I just wanted to let you know.

442
00:28:07,938 --> 00:28:09,481
All right. That's good news.

443
00:28:09,565 --> 00:28:11,400
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

444
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:12,693
All right...

445
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,695
um, I'll talk to you later.

446
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:16,154
Wait. Wait.

447
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:18,031
What is it?

448
00:28:18,115 --> 00:28:21,660
Look, about earlier...

449
00:28:22,536 --> 00:28:25,205
I don't want you to think that that made me uncomfortable.

450
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:27,457
It's just that since Teri died, I never thought I'd...

451
00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:29,376
Jack, it's all right.

452
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,546
- I understand.
- No. No, you don't.

453
00:28:34,006 --> 00:28:37,134
I just want you to know that...

454
00:28:39,344 --> 00:28:41,013
I'm falling in love with you, too.

455
00:28:44,433 --> 00:28:48,770
Wow. Um, you caught me off guard.

456
00:28:48,854 --> 00:28:50,147
Yeah. Sorry about that.

457
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:56,028
Look, Driscoll's coming back. I gotta go.

458
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:56,904
Then go.

459
00:28:57,029 --> 00:28:58,655
Okay. I'll talk to you when I get a break.

460
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,406
All right.

461
00:29:05,037 --> 00:29:06,205
What's happening with the suspect?

462
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:07,706
Ronnie's bringing him in.

463
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:09,416
Who is he?

464
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:13,170
Fortunately, for you, Jack, it's our problem, not yours.

465
00:29:13,921 --> 00:29:14,713
Right.

466
00:29:18,634 --> 00:29:19,760
I'm going, Dad.

467
00:29:19,927 --> 00:29:21,970
And there's nothing you can to do stop me.

468
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:24,306
How many cars do you need to get places?

469
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:27,309
I didn't come here to argue about the environment, Richard.

470
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:29,394
I didn't ask you to come at all.

471
00:29:32,564 --> 00:29:38,445
I do not want you to attend or to speak at that rally at Lockheed this afternoon.

472
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,447
You don't have any leverage over what I do anymore.

473
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:42,574
You haven't since I stopped taking your money.

474
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:45,202
Can't you ever think of anything besides yourself?

475
00:29:45,327 --> 00:29:46,745
If you do this,

476
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:48,747
it will humiliate the President,

477
00:29:48,872 --> 00:29:51,124
and it will be dangerous to national security.

478
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:52,918
What could be more dangerous

479
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:56,004
than 2,500 missile delivery systems?

480
00:29:56,088 --> 00:29:59,299
Oh, spare me your sixth-grade Michael Moore logic.

481
00:29:59,383 --> 00:30:02,219
The world is a little bit more complicated than that, Richard.

482
00:30:02,344 --> 00:30:04,346
We do not live in a utopia.

483
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:06,598
America has enemies.

484
00:30:06,682 --> 00:30:09,434
Enemies who were our friends a year ago.

485
00:30:09,643 --> 00:30:11,687
And in another year, it'll change again,

486
00:30:11,812 --> 00:30:15,607
unless people stop supporting your psychotic need to control the world.

487
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:17,484
Psychotic need?!

488
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:19,570
We serve our country!

489
00:30:19,736 --> 00:30:21,238
We serve the cause of freedom!

490
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:23,365
What do you do?!

491
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:27,536
Why don't you just go back to your little motorcade

492
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:31,582
and drive somewhere where people actually buy the lies you're selling?

493
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:36,086
Okay, look, look, we don't have to do this, okay? We do not have to.

494
00:30:36,336 --> 00:30:39,715
Fine, Dad. What do you want to do?

495
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,928
Do not disrespect me. I am your father.

496
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:15,542
Nothing.

497
00:31:15,751 --> 00:31:17,544
It was my friend, not me.

498
00:31:18,504 --> 00:31:20,714
- What's his name?
- Andrew.

499
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:24,134
- Andrew what?
- Andrew Paige.

500
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,261
Who did you tell?

501
00:31:27,054 --> 00:31:29,389
I swear, we didn't tell anyone. I don't know.

502
00:31:29,473 --> 00:31:30,641
Don't lie to me.

503
00:31:31,058 --> 00:31:33,477
I don't know! He just stumbled on the site and logged out!

504
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,229
Don't lie to me!

505
00:31:37,648 --> 00:31:39,775
Where is Andrew Paige now?

506
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:45,572
I was just doing my work-- I don't...

507
00:32:40,586 --> 00:32:43,255
You can use station five. Chloe's opened up a socket for you.

508
00:32:43,338 --> 00:32:46,133
You'll be able to access the records volume to look at those budget numbers.

509
00:32:46,216 --> 00:32:47,384
Okay, fine.

510
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:55,809
- I know this guy.
- Who, Sherek?

511
00:32:56,018 --> 00:32:57,436
We were tracking him when I was here.

512
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,770
We knew him as Jann Bolek.

513
00:32:58,896 --> 00:33:02,316
We linked him to over a dozen complicated bombings in Europe in the late '90s.

514
00:33:02,441 --> 00:33:04,735
Unfortunately, we weren't able to stop him from today's attack.

515
00:33:04,818 --> 00:33:06,111
But we did catch him.

516
00:33:06,236 --> 00:33:09,198
And, Jack, I'm sorry I was abrupt before.

517
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:11,617
You helped us with the takedown. Thank you.

518
00:33:17,331 --> 00:33:19,750
Erin, listen to me.

519
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:21,752
This doesn't make sense.

520
00:33:22,044 --> 00:33:24,338
I know this guy's file. He's a major handler.

521
00:33:24,463 --> 00:33:27,674
He wouldn't risk exposing himself here in the United States for a train bombing.

522
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:28,967
It's not big enough.

523
00:33:30,302 --> 00:33:33,013
We'll take that into consideration when we interrogate him.

524
00:33:33,138 --> 00:33:35,432
Give my best to Secretary Heller.

525
00:33:42,648 --> 00:33:44,441
- Chloe.
- What?

526
00:33:44,566 --> 00:33:46,777
The original data that you pulled up on Sherek,

527
00:33:46,902 --> 00:33:49,196
was there any indication of a secondary strike?

528
00:33:49,321 --> 00:33:52,074
No. Everything supports that he was here for the train bombing.

529
00:33:52,157 --> 00:33:53,867
But there was a time discrepancy.

530
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:55,077
What do you mean?

531
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:58,455
There was some high-probability chatter indicating an attack at 8:00 a.m.

532
00:33:58,539 --> 00:33:59,998
The train bombing happened at 7:00.

533
00:34:00,082 --> 00:34:02,668
They didn't give a window? They actually called for a specific time?

534
00:34:02,793 --> 00:34:04,837
Yeah, but the intel was off by an hour.

535
00:34:04,962 --> 00:34:06,839
Driscoll thought it was close enough.

536
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,216
You can't do that.

537
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:11,552
What's your log-on I.D. for Interpol overnights?

538
00:34:11,677 --> 00:34:12,845
I'm not comfortable doing this.

539
00:34:12,928 --> 00:34:15,430
Chloe, please.

540
00:34:20,644 --> 00:34:21,645
You're in.

541
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,363
Is this the source?

542
00:34:31,446 --> 00:34:33,031
Yes. That's the decipher.

543
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:38,579
Calls for an 8:00 strike

544
00:34:38,662 --> 00:34:40,455
"...unless target deviates." That doesn't make sense.

545
00:34:40,539 --> 00:34:43,083
Trains don't deviate, they're on a fixed course and schedule.

546
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:45,419
Sometimes when Interpol's breaking codes and communiques,

547
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,462
it won't use the exact wording.

548
00:34:48,964 --> 00:34:50,507
What are you thinking, Jack?

549
00:34:51,091 --> 00:34:53,510
Sherek didn't come here for a train bombing.

550
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,637
Something's going to happen at 8:00.

551
00:34:56,763 --> 00:34:58,557
That's ten minutes from now.

552
00:35:12,154 --> 00:35:14,114
No, Paul, I don't want to wait.

553
00:35:14,281 --> 00:35:16,450
I'm going to call my lawyer as soon as we get back to D.C.

554
00:35:16,533 --> 00:35:18,827
and we're going to get this divorce process moving.

555
00:35:18,911 --> 00:35:19,828
Well, what's the hurry?

556
00:35:19,912 --> 00:35:21,538
We said we'd take a year apart and see what happened.

557
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:23,248
Yeah, but it's almost been a year.

558
00:35:23,373 --> 00:35:25,125
I don't want to wait any longer.

559
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:27,503
Hang on.

560
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,548
Look, I got to take this call. We'll talk when I back to D.C.

561
00:35:31,715 --> 00:35:34,134
- Yeah, fine.
- All right, bye.

562
00:35:35,427 --> 00:35:36,094
Jack.

563
00:35:36,178 --> 00:35:38,472
Hey, I need to speak with your father.

564
00:35:38,722 --> 00:35:40,933
He's still in with Richard. He doesn't want to be interrupted.

565
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:42,518
This is urgent. I need him to get me clearance

566
00:35:42,643 --> 00:35:44,937
so I can interrogate the suspect in the train bombing.

567
00:35:45,062 --> 00:35:46,897
Driscoll won't let me anywhere near him.

568
00:35:47,022 --> 00:35:50,317
I believe he's got information about a secondary hit, a larger one.

569
00:35:50,442 --> 00:35:52,486
Supposed to take place this morning at 8:00.

570
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:53,820
Well, it's almost 8:00 now.

571
00:35:53,904 --> 00:35:55,364
I know, that's why I need to speak with him.

572
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:57,241
All right, hang on.

573
00:36:04,373 --> 00:36:07,209
I'm going to speak at that rally this afternoon, Dad.

574
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:10,921
And it's not because I hate you.

575
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:14,007
It's 'cause it's something I believe in.

576
00:36:14,132 --> 00:36:16,718
Did it ever occur to you that these people are using you?

577
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:22,307
Don't you realize they're letting you speak for one reason and one reason only,

578
00:36:22,391 --> 00:36:25,435
because you are my son!

579
00:36:26,687 --> 00:36:28,647
Well, I wish I weren't.

580
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,281
What is it, Audrey?

581
00:36:37,364 --> 00:36:39,741
I'm sorry, it's Jack. It's urgent.

582
00:36:40,158 --> 00:36:41,201
Excuse me, Richard.

583
00:36:41,285 --> 00:36:43,662
What could be more important than intimidating me?

584
00:36:47,207 --> 00:36:49,126
I didn't know you were hiding in the car.

585
00:36:49,626 --> 00:36:51,545
Richie, why are you doing this to Dad?

586
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,714
- Can't you just back off?
- I'm not doing anything to him.

587
00:36:53,797 --> 00:36:56,925
You know if you go to that protest at Lockheed it's going to hurt him.

588
00:36:57,009 --> 00:36:59,303
Whatever it takes to stop what he's doing.

589
00:37:01,221 --> 00:37:03,599
Jack, if I step on Driscoll's toes and it doesn't pay off,

590
00:37:03,682 --> 00:37:06,393
all of a sudden, I have ton of political fallout to deal with.

591
00:37:06,518 --> 00:37:07,519
Sir, I understand that.

592
00:37:07,644 --> 00:37:09,354
But I wouldn't be asking you this if I didn't believe

593
00:37:09,438 --> 00:37:12,566
there was an imminent threat to national security that I could help avert.

594
00:37:12,733 --> 00:37:14,484
Share your concerns with Driscoll.

595
00:37:14,568 --> 00:37:17,529
- Let CTU handle it.
- Sir, there isn't time.

596
00:37:17,654 --> 00:37:18,947
It's the President.

597
00:37:19,072 --> 00:37:21,074
Jack, it's the President. I've got to go.

598
00:37:22,242 --> 00:37:23,076
Yes, sir.

599
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:26,622
Damn.

600
00:37:50,979 --> 00:37:52,356
How long you been in Los Angeles?

601
00:37:55,025 --> 00:37:55,776
Who are you working with?

602
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:00,447
We don't have time for this.

603
00:38:01,114 --> 00:38:02,157
Okay, you listen to me.

604
00:38:02,366 --> 00:38:04,409
Unless you start giving me some answers right now,

605
00:38:04,493 --> 00:38:06,620
you're going to end up in a hole for the next 30 years.

606
00:38:08,121 --> 00:38:09,331
Who are you working with?!

607
00:38:12,459 --> 00:38:14,920
Why did you bomb that train?!

608
00:38:34,439 --> 00:38:36,233
How far can I push this guy?

609
00:38:36,942 --> 00:38:39,069
We have to find out who he's working with.

610
00:38:39,152 --> 00:38:40,737
Should go as far as we have to.

611
00:38:41,071 --> 00:38:42,531
Maybe we should bring Johnson in.

612
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,245
Sorry, sir, this area's off-limits.

613
00:38:48,453 --> 00:38:50,747
Oh, I'm looking for Erin Driscoll.

614
00:39:04,178 --> 00:39:05,137
Jack!

615
00:39:05,804 --> 00:39:06,722
Jack, what are you doing?

616
00:39:06,847 --> 00:39:07,764
Call security now.

617
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:09,141
What is happening at 8:00?

618
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:10,851
Son of a bitch, he's jammed the codes.

619
00:39:11,602 --> 00:39:13,061
I am not messing with you.

620
00:39:13,312 --> 00:39:16,440
You are going to tell me... what is happening at 8:00?!

621
00:39:16,607 --> 00:39:17,941
Jack, holster your weapon!

622
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:20,068
Jack!

623
00:39:20,402 --> 00:39:21,862
I said holster your weapon!

624
00:39:22,988 --> 00:39:24,698
Call Medical.

625
00:39:25,616 --> 00:39:27,159
What is your primary objective?!

626
00:39:27,284 --> 00:39:29,369
I'll order security to shoot you if I have to.

627
00:39:29,453 --> 00:39:30,287
Get that door open.

628
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,956
What is your primary objective?!

629
00:39:33,081 --> 00:39:35,250
Secretary of Defense!

630
00:39:37,461 --> 00:39:38,253
Heller.

631
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:41,006
- Secretary Heller?
- Yes.

632
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:42,382
Secretary Heller's the target.

633
00:39:42,466 --> 00:39:44,051
Call Secret Service now.

634
00:39:44,134 --> 00:39:46,053
Call now. Get a team on the way.

635
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:49,890
Yeah, I'll hold.

636
00:39:50,641 --> 00:39:53,060
The President wants us back in D.C. tonight.

637
00:39:54,895 --> 00:39:56,563
What meetings can we eject?

638
00:39:56,688 --> 00:39:59,816
Not Vandenberg. The media's expecting you there.

639
00:39:59,942 --> 00:40:01,735
Maybe we skip Paradigm,

640
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,820
and handle that with a teleconference next week.

641
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:07,574
Come on, pick up the phone!

642
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,494
Tell the President we'll we rearrange our schedule

643
00:40:10,536 --> 00:40:11,995
and fly back this afternoon.

644
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:12,496
Yeah.

645
00:40:12,621 --> 00:40:13,664
Audrey, it's Jack.

646
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:15,374
- Are you still at Richard's?
- Yeah.

647
00:40:15,457 --> 00:40:17,084
You need to get your father out of there now!

648
00:40:17,209 --> 00:40:19,002
The bombing this morning was diversiory!
