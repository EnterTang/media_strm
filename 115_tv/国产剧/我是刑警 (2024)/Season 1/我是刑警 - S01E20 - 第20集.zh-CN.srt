Subs by Traff and Raceman

2
00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:02,294
And this is the two-bedroom.

3
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:04,713
Wow.

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,634
By the hammer of Thor!

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,260
Can you afford this place?

6
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:11,261
Yeah.

7
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:12,930
I can with this new promotion.

8
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:14,932
It's...a lot more money.

9
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,601
Like "get away with murdering
my first wife" kind of dough.

10
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:18,720
Mm-hmm.

11
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:22,021
See, now, I could hang
a huge TV right there.

12
00:00:22,183 --> 00:00:24,908
You could get that third humidifier
you always dreamed about.

13
00:00:25,061 --> 00:00:25,779
Slow down.

14
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:28,023
I'm not ready
to move my humidifiers yet.

15
00:00:28,198 --> 00:00:29,192
Oh, I know.

16
00:00:29,366 --> 00:00:32,240
I don't mean right away.
I just meant...someday.

17
00:00:32,406 --> 00:00:32,900
Hopefully.

18
00:00:33,076 --> 00:00:34,821
Yeah, good.
Someday.

19
00:00:34,995 --> 00:00:37,451
But for now,
I got a great job.

20
00:00:37,626 --> 00:00:39,413
A kick-ass girlfriend.

21
00:00:39,588 --> 00:00:41,042
I deserve an apartment to match.

22
00:00:41,206 --> 00:00:43,662
And I think this is definitely it.

23
00:00:43,838 --> 00:00:45,173
I'll take this one too.

24
00:00:45,338 --> 00:00:48,961
My son Ahmed will keep
his motorcycles here.

25
00:00:49,137 --> 00:00:52,461
Oh! Thanks for coming.

26
00:00:53,598 --> 00:00:56,132
Oh...ooh.

27
00:01:16,915 --> 00:01:17,612
Lemon!

28
00:01:17,787 --> 00:01:19,583
Oh, welcome back.
How was Paris?

29
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,740
Paris was fantastic.

30
00:01:21,918 --> 00:01:25,622
We stayed in this little place in the Seventh
that Phoebe knew about.

31
00:01:25,798 --> 00:01:27,252
I'm Phoebe.
We've met before.

32
00:01:27,428 --> 00:01:29,841
Jack proposed to me outside your office.

33
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,173
I have hollow bones.

34
00:01:31,348 --> 00:01:32,003
Like a bird.

35
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:32,591
Yes, no.

36
00:01:32,758 --> 00:01:33,762
I remember you, hi.

37
00:01:33,928 --> 00:01:34,922
Hi.

38
00:01:35,097 --> 00:01:36,382
Well, I should go.

39
00:01:36,558 --> 00:01:40,302
We've just won the auction rights to
a fantastic collection of Chinese erotica.

40
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:42,432
Pick out a good one for me.

41
00:01:42,607 --> 00:01:43,851
Careful.

42
00:01:44,028 --> 00:01:46,270
Bye.

43
00:01:48,988 --> 00:01:51,063
So...have you guys set a date?

44
00:01:51,235 --> 00:01:51,821
Yes, we have.

45
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:52,731
May 18th.

46
00:01:52,907 --> 00:01:55,362
That's Bianca's wedding date.
It was my idea.

47
00:01:55,536 --> 00:01:56,320
That's fast.

48
00:01:56,497 --> 00:01:58,243
Well, there are no rules in love, Lemon.

49
00:01:58,417 --> 00:02:00,993
My...Princeton roommate
did it the right way.

50
00:02:01,168 --> 00:02:02,782
Dated his college girlfriend for 13 years,

51
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:04,543
and the marriage
didn't last eight months.

52
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:08,003
And now he's a post-op transgender.

53
00:02:08,176 --> 00:02:09,122
Will you look at that?

54
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:13,052
Phoebe reset my watch to New York time
while I was sleeping on the plane.

55
00:02:13,218 --> 00:02:15,010
She really is a wonderful girl.

56
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:17,302
And I do hope the two of you
get to know each other better.

57
00:02:17,478 --> 00:02:18,433
Okay, sure.

58
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:19,763
Why don't you have a girls' day out?

59
00:02:19,935 --> 00:02:20,843
Take Jenna with you.

60
00:02:21,017 --> 00:02:22,300
You could have lunch, go shopping.

61
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:25,971
Here...take my gold card.

62
00:02:26,275 --> 00:02:27,311
Ooh, it's heavy.

63
00:02:27,486 --> 00:02:29,310
It's...made of gold.

64
00:02:29,488 --> 00:02:31,943
Ah. Wow.

65
00:02:33,235 --> 00:02:34,483
Turned me down, Liz Lemon.

66
00:02:34,657 --> 00:02:35,072
Who?

67
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,152
The damn bank.

68
00:02:36,326 --> 00:02:38,701
I need a loan to finance
my Thomas Jefferson movie.

69
00:02:38,865 --> 00:02:40,702
It's gonna be at least $30 million

70
00:02:40,865 --> 00:02:42,410
with all the Claymation
sex scenes in it.

71
00:02:42,575 --> 00:02:43,783
And they didn't want to pay for that?

72
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:44,661
It's all right.

73
00:02:44,835 --> 00:02:46,503
The movie's just a small part of my plan.

74
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:47,160
What plan?

75
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:49,210
The Tracy Jordan comeback.

76
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:52,133
I'm doing a comedy tour,
a Michael McDonald cover album.

77
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,343
Ah, boy, I don't know, Tray.

78
00:02:53,508 --> 00:02:55,752
I don't think of you
as a great multitasker.

79
00:02:55,928 --> 00:02:56,842
What can I do?

80
00:02:57,016 --> 00:02:58,473
I'm on my grind.

81
00:02:58,638 --> 00:03:01,721
I'm gonna have so much money,
my grandkids are gonna play lacrosse.

82
00:03:01,897 --> 00:03:04,853
Lacrosse, Liz Lemon.

83
00:03:05,016 --> 00:03:05,893
"I'm on my grind."

84
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:08,770
Is that a...

85
00:03:09,275 --> 00:03:09,851
There he is.

86
00:03:10,027 --> 00:03:12,021
The Floydster!

87
00:03:12,197 --> 00:03:13,902
I heard you were going in
for your final interview.

88
00:03:14,067 --> 00:03:14,732
I wanted to put in a good word.

89
00:03:14,906 --> 00:03:16,403
All right, well,
that should put me over the top.

90
00:03:16,575 --> 00:03:17,941
Oh, you're already there.

91
00:03:18,118 --> 00:03:19,653
The other candidate is an outsider.

92
00:03:19,827 --> 00:03:21,533
And we like to promote from within.

93
00:03:21,706 --> 00:03:25,032
Plus, his name is Alan Garkel.

94
00:03:25,207 --> 00:03:29,082
You're never gonna lose a job
to a guy named Garkel.

95
00:03:29,257 --> 00:03:31,872
Did someone say my name?

96
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,962
Nah, you're not gonna beat that.

97
00:03:37,058 --> 00:03:40,260
Well-played, Garkel.

98
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:46,260
Because Carl's trying to kill the gophers,
but then the explosion knocks Danny's ball

99
00:03:46,438 --> 00:03:47,893
into the hole,
and he wins the tournament.

100
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:50,481
And that is the plot of Caddyshack.

101
00:03:50,645 --> 00:03:51,772
I can't believe
you've never seen it.

102
00:03:51,946 --> 00:03:53,902
Classic.

103
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,402
Oh! Jeez, I'm sorry.

104
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,732
Oh, you like Wagner?

105
00:03:56,907 --> 00:03:58,861
No, I like Elmer Fudd.

106
00:03:59,036 --> 00:04:00,322
 Kill da wabbit

107
00:04:00,498 --> 00:04:02,911
 Kill da wabbit

108
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:08,082
My parents were both poets, so I...
don't really get it.

109
00:04:08,245 --> 00:04:11,752
So this has just been
a whirlwind romance for you.

110
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:14,711
Just a...whirl of wind.

111
00:04:14,886 --> 00:04:16,713
Look, I know what you must be thinking.

112
00:04:16,888 --> 00:04:19,590
What kind of a woman
marries a man she hardly knows?

113
00:04:19,768 --> 00:04:21,053
What is she after?

114
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:21,760
No, no, no.

115
00:04:21,925 --> 00:04:22,842
I don't think that.

116
00:04:23,017 --> 00:04:25,551
I completely get it,
why you would wanna marry Jack.

117
00:04:25,726 --> 00:04:28,351
I'd marry Jack in a heartbeat.

118
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,060
I would have a three-way
with two Jacks.

119
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:32,232
You need to cool it.

120
00:04:32,395 --> 00:04:35,060
Let's face it-- at our age,
we can't afford to waste any time.

121
00:04:35,236 --> 00:04:37,062
Mm-hmm.

122
00:04:37,238 --> 00:04:38,612
Floyd and I have been dating for a month.

123
00:04:38,777 --> 00:04:42,903
Do you think I should be mad
that I don't have a ring?

124
00:04:43,076 --> 00:04:45,411
Wow, how Sex in the City are we right now?

125
00:04:45,578 --> 00:04:51,253
I'm Samantha, you're Charlotte,
and you're the lady at home who watches it.

126
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:54,251
Dude, check it out.

127
00:04:54,415 --> 00:04:55,793
Bill Cosby hates you.

128
00:04:55,966 --> 00:04:56,713
What?

129
00:04:56,887 --> 00:04:57,583
Look here.

130
00:04:57,758 --> 00:05:01,921
"Tracy Jordan has made a career
out of exploiting black stereotypes.

131
00:05:02,098 --> 00:05:05,012
He is an embarrassment
to African-Americans."

132
00:05:05,186 --> 00:05:06,342
Why would he say that?

133
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:09,263
What have I ever done
to embarrass black people?

134
00:05:09,437 --> 00:05:10,680
Uh...

135
00:05:10,856 --> 00:05:12,141
Why are we doing this?

136
00:05:12,318 --> 00:05:14,311
Because the Jets lost!

137
00:05:14,488 --> 00:05:16,272
Mr. Jordan, your manager called.

138
00:05:16,445 --> 00:05:18,813
Temple University has canceled
your stand-up appearance.

139
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:22,403
And Michael McDonald is denying permission
to record any of his songs.

140
00:05:22,576 --> 00:05:27,991
In other words: Oh, Tracy,
you can't Use any of my songs.

141
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:31,540
This is no coincidence.

142
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:32,622
What are you talking about?

143
00:05:32,795 --> 00:05:34,040
The bank loan.

144
00:05:34,304 --> 00:05:35,871
The Michael McDonald situation.

145
00:05:36,043 --> 00:05:37,298
Temple University.

146
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:40,179
Dr. Cosby is sending a message!

147
00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:41,751
They're out to destroy me!

148
00:05:41,928 --> 00:05:43,881
Who is?

149
00:05:44,055 --> 00:05:47,260
The Black Crusaders.

150
00:05:54,185 --> 00:05:56,271
Oh, Floyd would love this one.

151
00:05:56,445 --> 00:05:57,441
Yikes!

152
00:05:57,606 --> 00:06:00,060
If I was gonna spend $600
to have my boobs pinched,

153
00:06:00,236 --> 00:06:03,733
I would have gone to that fundraiser
at the Clintons' house.

154
00:06:03,907 --> 00:06:06,610
Come on, that was solid!

155
00:06:06,787 --> 00:06:09,160
Liz, I'm concerned
I'm boring Jack sexually.

156
00:06:09,326 --> 00:06:09,822
No, no.

157
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:10,623
No...ugh.

158
00:06:10,786 --> 00:06:14,371
We've only just got engaged, and already our
intercourse is infrequent and unimaginative.

159
00:06:14,548 --> 00:06:15,953
Phoebe, I'm really not that kind of girlfriend.

160
00:06:16,128 --> 00:06:17,960
I would gladly pick you up at the airport.

161
00:06:18,126 --> 00:06:21,420
In Paris, he fell asleep
on top of me.

162
00:06:21,597 --> 00:06:24,421
I mean, I just want to make him happy.

163
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:26,421
If he's happy,
I'm happy, you know?

164
00:06:26,598 --> 00:06:27,172
Mm.

165
00:06:27,347 --> 00:06:29,382
Do you have that credit card?

166
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:31,181
Thanks.

167
00:06:31,355 --> 00:06:33,933
Hi, I'll take everything.

168
00:06:34,107 --> 00:06:35,471
Liz, can you help me?

169
00:06:35,647 --> 00:06:36,313
Yes, ma'am.

170
00:06:36,485 --> 00:06:38,940
I don't know you,
but I will help you.

171
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,063
Damn it.

172
00:06:40,236 --> 00:06:41,191
I can't believe it.

173
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:41,982
Garkel?

174
00:06:42,156 --> 00:06:42,690
I'm sorry.

175
00:06:42,867 --> 00:06:43,860
I'm just sick of it.

176
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,532
I'm so tired of this city.

177
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:49,493
I am so tired of the rat race.

178
00:06:50,538 --> 00:06:51,491
Fellas!

179
00:06:51,668 --> 00:06:53,372
You gotta keep it down, okay?

180
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,540
I got work in the morning.

181
00:06:54,707 --> 00:06:56,620
Molnya is looking very strong tonight.

182
00:06:56,797 --> 00:06:59,500
Mr. Debarber, come on.

183
00:06:59,676 --> 00:07:00,172
Fine.

184
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:03,130
20 across the board.

185
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,880
Yeah, you gotta talk to your landlord
about that rat race.

186
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:07,050
That is my landlord.

187
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:07,802
Oh.

188
00:07:07,976 --> 00:07:09,091
Yeah.

189
00:07:09,265 --> 00:07:11,221
Maybe I just need to go out of town
for a little while.

190
00:07:11,395 --> 00:07:13,353
That's a good idea.
Vermont is always nice.

191
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:15,011
Or the Bahamas.

192
00:07:15,186 --> 00:07:17,222
I was thinking of Cleveland.

193
00:07:17,398 --> 00:07:18,563
That is also a place.

194
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,730
I just haven't been home in a long time.

195
00:07:20,896 --> 00:07:22,230
We need to search your bag.

196
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:22,810
Ugh.

197
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:25,402
Of course they do.

198
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:27,613
You know, I dream
about moving back to Lakewood.

199
00:07:27,787 --> 00:07:30,200
Or maybe even Shaker Heights.

200
00:07:30,368 --> 00:07:31,950
Big Creek Parkway.

201
00:07:32,117 --> 00:07:35,333
Sending the kids
to St. John Bosco's, you know.

202
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,873
Maybe even cheering on
the tribe at the Jake.

203
00:07:38,048 --> 00:07:40,660
This dream, this
is way down the road, right?

204
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:42,210
Yeah. Yeah.

205
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,462
Three, maybe four years.

206
00:07:44,636 --> 00:07:46,502
What's this fungus cream for?

207
00:07:46,678 --> 00:07:47,250
All right, that's it.

208
00:07:47,428 --> 00:07:48,133
Show's over.

209
00:07:48,308 --> 00:07:49,301
Gimme that.

210
00:07:49,465 --> 00:07:52,132
Let's just walk.

211
00:07:52,308 --> 00:07:53,930
So how long do you see yourself
living in New York?

212
00:07:54,095 --> 00:07:55,263
Well, like, forever.

213
00:07:55,435 --> 00:07:56,221
At least, I did.

214
00:07:56,397 --> 00:07:57,970
Really?

215
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:01,772
You wanna end up like that?

216
00:08:02,986 --> 00:08:03,602
No.

217
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:04,651
I'm gonna be like her.

218
00:08:04,815 --> 00:08:08,733
Oh, there is nothing
like New York in the spring!

219
00:08:08,908 --> 00:08:10,073
It's--oh!

220
00:08:10,246 --> 00:08:12,202
Ooh.

221
00:08:12,365 --> 00:08:13,031
All right, come on.

222
00:08:13,207 --> 00:08:14,570
This is the capital of the world.

223
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:16,120
The culture, the div--

224
00:08:16,286 --> 00:08:17,370
Ugh!

225
00:08:17,537 --> 00:08:18,120
Uck!

226
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:18,791
You all right?

227
00:08:18,955 --> 00:08:21,120
He spit in my mouth!

228
00:08:21,298 --> 00:08:22,791
Ugh!

229
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:24,370
Let's go to Cleveland.

230
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:27,212
Oh, blurgh!

231
00:08:29,466 --> 00:08:31,801
Hey, Frank told me
about that Cosby thing.

232
00:08:31,976 --> 00:08:32,842
That is harsh.

233
00:08:33,017 --> 00:08:34,130
Harsh?
I'm done.

234
00:08:34,308 --> 00:08:37,262
The Black Crusaders want
to make an example out of me.

235
00:08:37,435 --> 00:08:38,640
I'm not gonna ask you
who that is.

236
00:08:38,817 --> 00:08:41,932
The Black Crusaders are a secret group
of powerful black Americans.

237
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:45,063
Bill Cosby and Oprah Winfrey
are the chief majors.

238
00:08:45,237 --> 00:08:48,691
But Jesse Jackson, Colin Powell,
and Gordon from Sesame Street,

239
00:08:48,865 --> 00:08:49,650
they're members too.

240
00:08:49,826 --> 00:08:52,990
And they meet four times a year
in the skull of the Statue of Liberty.

241
00:08:53,155 --> 00:08:55,070
You can read about that on the interweb.

242
00:08:55,308 --> 00:08:57,701
Ah, well, it must be true
if it's on the "interweb."

243
00:08:57,877 --> 00:08:59,082
Right, uh-huh.

244
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:01,040
Make fun of me all you want, Liz Lemon.

245
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:05,670
Do you know they'll ruin anybody who they
think are making black people look bad?

246
00:09:05,835 --> 00:09:07,793
They tanked 50 Cent's movie.

247
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:09,843
The blew out Terrell Owens' ankle.

248
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:14,801
And they canceled Eddie Murphy's Oscar,
'cause he, uh, ran out on Scary Spice.

249
00:09:14,976 --> 00:09:16,760
And now they after Tracy Jordan!

250
00:09:16,938 --> 00:09:20,723
Tracy, I know the movie is important to you,
and you're stressed out and everything,

251
00:09:20,896 --> 00:09:22,812
but keep it together, okay?

252
00:09:22,987 --> 00:09:23,772
The cleanup continues.

253
00:09:23,936 --> 00:09:26,103
Fortunately, there were no injuries.

254
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:29,483
Tracy Jordan, the Black Crusaders
are coming for you.

255
00:09:29,656 --> 00:09:30,981
We'll have more on the weather coming up...

256
00:09:31,157 --> 00:09:35,453
Man, I wish somebody else had seen that.

257
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:36,992
Hi.

258
00:09:37,165 --> 00:09:38,871
Look what Phoebe got me.

259
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,243
Golf clubs?

260
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,163
Not just golf clubs.

261
00:09:43,336 --> 00:09:46,121
These clubs once belonged
to President Gerald Ford.

262
00:09:46,298 --> 00:09:48,383
Oh, wow.

263
00:09:48,545 --> 00:09:50,631
So what do you think of Phoebe?

264
00:09:50,795 --> 00:09:53,510
Oh, well...
we had fun.

265
00:09:53,675 --> 00:09:56,432
And, uh, Phoebe bought
some bonkers underwear.

266
00:09:56,598 --> 00:09:57,801
So have fun with that tonight.

267
00:09:57,976 --> 00:09:59,223
Well, not tonight.

268
00:09:59,396 --> 00:10:01,512
Uh, may I?
Thank you.

269
00:10:01,688 --> 00:10:03,022
Not tonight unfortunately.

270
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:07,061
She's, uh, speaking in a seminar
up at Columbia.

271
00:10:07,237 --> 00:10:13,942
And as much as I would like to attend,
I haven't been above 72nd Street in over a decade.

272
00:10:14,118 --> 00:10:15,821
Well, I'm glad you're happy.

273
00:10:15,998 --> 00:10:17,361
Ha!

274
00:10:17,537 --> 00:10:20,201
It's all Phoebe.

275
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:23,740
We have an attraction that can
only be described as...

276
00:10:23,918 --> 00:10:25,453
wolf-like.

277
00:10:25,628 --> 00:10:26,503
Lupine.

278
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:27,463
Okay.

279
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,213
I am so exhausted.

280
00:10:29,377 --> 00:10:31,633
Paris was, to borrow a phrase,

281
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,630
just...bonkers.

282
00:10:33,805 --> 00:10:36,802
Yes, Phoebe said.

283
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:51,940
Do you cover him?

284
00:10:52,776 --> 00:10:54,361
Phoebe isn't going to Columbia tonight.

285
00:10:54,538 --> 00:10:57,361
She had me call a car to take her
to this address downtown.

286
00:10:57,538 --> 00:10:59,281
So what do you want me to do,
go spy on her?

287
00:10:59,457 --> 00:11:00,571
For Mr. Donaghy's sake.

288
00:11:00,746 --> 00:11:02,571
I know you have
your doubts about this.

289
00:11:02,747 --> 00:11:03,623
I can see it in your eyes.

290
00:11:03,786 --> 00:11:05,120
It's weird, right?

291
00:11:05,296 --> 00:11:06,661
Then again, all relationships are weird.

292
00:11:06,835 --> 00:11:08,831
I mean, my boyfriend Floyd
wants to go to Cleveland.

293
00:11:09,005 --> 00:11:10,330
Ah, thank God.

294
00:11:10,508 --> 00:11:13,751
Mr. Donaghy's office.

295
00:11:17,596 --> 00:11:20,680
Just a quick look.

296
00:11:23,936 --> 00:11:27,270
By the hammer of Thor!

297
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:35,441
Ew.

298
00:11:49,377 --> 00:11:50,583
Jack, I have to talk to you.

299
00:11:50,757 --> 00:11:51,921
Is this about the Tracy situation?

300
00:11:52,085 --> 00:11:52,122
No.

301
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:52,961
Then it'll have to wait.

302
00:11:53,138 --> 00:11:54,132
What Tracy situation?

303
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,340
I tried to call you.

304
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,880
He set fire to a cardboard
cutout of Al Roker,

305
00:11:58,056 --> 00:11:59,722
and now he's locked himself
in his dressing room.

306
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:01,090
Oh, brother.

307
00:12:01,266 --> 00:12:03,221
Tracy!

308
00:12:03,397 --> 00:12:03,801
Come out.

309
00:12:03,976 --> 00:12:05,721
Nobody is trying to get you.

310
00:12:05,897 --> 00:12:09,102
Have you seen the cover
of this month's Oprah magazine?

311
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:13,600
It's an anagram for
"Outlaw Sour Tray."

312
00:12:13,856 --> 00:12:16,522
Who taught Tracy about anagrams?

313
00:12:16,698 --> 00:12:19,110
I'm gonna call Dr. Spaceman.

314
00:12:19,287 --> 00:12:21,113
Hey, car's downstairs.
You ready to go?

315
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:22,151
Um...

316
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,410
The Black Crusaders
are trying to get rid of me.

317
00:12:24,575 --> 00:12:26,531
They want me to disappear like Coolio.

318
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:27,830
Coolio is around!

319
00:12:27,995 --> 00:12:28,740
What--

320
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,753
Would you also prescribe
something for Tracy

321
00:12:30,915 --> 00:12:33,710
which would keep him awake during sex?

322
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:34,581
Oh, great.

323
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:35,792
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

324
00:12:35,968 --> 00:12:38,193
Thanks.

325
00:12:38,387 --> 00:12:40,802
Let's get outta here.

326
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,381
What hot spot's got
the hippest groove?

327
00:12:43,556 --> 00:12:44,013
Welcome to Cleveland.

328
00:12:44,185 --> 00:12:48,352
Where all the real gone daddies move

329
00:12:51,148 --> 00:12:53,982
What smells so good?

330
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,481
Cleveland.

331
00:12:55,658 --> 00:12:58,440
Where the jet set swing with hepcats

332
00:12:58,617 --> 00:13:01,191
Shop at Higby's,
then we'll hit the Flats

333
00:13:01,368 --> 00:13:02,443
Excuse me.

334
00:13:02,617 --> 00:13:03,782
Are you a model?

335
00:13:03,955 --> 00:13:04,492
No.

336
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:05,991
Oh, you are so skinny.

337
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:08,622
You really should eat something.

338
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:12,160
I say, Cleveland, hello

339
00:13:13,258 --> 00:13:14,580
Yeah

340
00:13:14,755 --> 00:13:17,843
New York and Paris just don't have

341
00:13:18,008 --> 00:13:21,263
The sights you see and you can have

342
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:22,302
Ugh.

343
00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:25,131
Would you like to pet
a real police horse?

344
00:13:25,306 --> 00:13:27,552
Chef Boyardee was born here

345
00:13:27,726 --> 00:13:29,970
Yes!

346
00:13:36,407 --> 00:13:37,813
Oh, ladies first.

347
00:13:37,987 --> 00:13:39,821
I say Cleveland, hello

348
00:13:39,988 --> 00:13:45,820
Hi, I'll have two hotdogs,
a pretzel with extra melted cheese...

349
00:13:46,155 --> 00:13:46,700
Hiya.

350
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:49,700
Ms. Lemon, this is Kenneth,
the NBC page in New York City.

351
00:13:49,876 --> 00:13:52,621
I hate to bother you out west,
but Tracy Jordan hasn't come to work.

352
00:13:52,796 --> 00:13:55,001
Kenneth, don't be so New York uptight.

353
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,961
I'm sure he'll show up.

354
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:57,580
 Look over there,

355
00:13:57,756 --> 00:13:59,751
I think I see a movie star

356
00:13:59,926 --> 00:14:02,841
 Even movie stars,
they come to Cleveland To get away

357
00:14:03,018 --> 00:14:03,591
 Tracy Jordan,

358
00:14:03,765 --> 00:14:05,093
you've gotta get away

359
00:14:05,266 --> 00:14:06,221
 Gotta get away,

360
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:08,143
gotta get away

361
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:11,100
 To Cleveland

362
00:14:11,937 --> 00:14:13,811
Liz...

363
00:14:13,977 --> 00:14:16,981
I have something important
I wanna talk to you about.

364
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,861
The top law firm
in Cleveland wants me.

365
00:14:20,028 --> 00:14:22,073
And...I think
I should accept.

366
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:25,033
What? Really?

367
00:14:25,196 --> 00:14:25,822
What's this?

368
00:14:25,995 --> 00:14:28,821
It's a house in the Heights
that I can afford.

369
00:14:28,996 --> 00:14:31,831
When did you have time
to look for jobs and houses?

370
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,741
When you were at
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

371
00:14:33,918 --> 00:14:35,792
Did I tell you
I sat in ZZ Top's car?

372
00:14:35,957 --> 00:14:37,750
And then I had lunch
with Little Richard.

373
00:14:37,927 --> 00:14:40,673
And, I know
it's not TGS, but...

374
00:14:40,837 --> 00:14:43,051
I'm sure you can find a job
at one of the local TV stations.

375
00:14:43,218 --> 00:14:44,592
You sure could.

376
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:49,513
We need a host
for a new cooking show on WKYC.

377
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:52,802
Uh...

378
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:02,613
Where have you been?

379
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:03,942
Cleveland.

380
00:15:04,117 --> 00:15:07,072
For God sakes, Lemon,
we'd all like to flee to the Cleve.

381
00:15:07,245 --> 00:15:09,912
And club up down at the Flats
and have lunch with Little Richard.

382
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:13,413
But we fight those urges
because we have responsibilities.

383
00:15:13,588 --> 00:15:14,333
What's going on?

384
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:15,123
Tracy.

385
00:15:15,295 --> 00:15:15,911
He's missing.

386
00:15:16,087 --> 00:15:16,703
What?

387
00:15:16,877 --> 00:15:18,331
No. Kenneth, have you
tried to call Tracy?

388
00:15:18,506 --> 00:15:21,173
Yes, ma'am, I tried
all six of his cell phones.

389
00:15:21,336 --> 00:15:24,500
It's almost as if he never existed.

390
00:15:24,678 --> 00:15:28,341
Or maybe he's not answering.

391
00:15:28,807 --> 00:15:31,723
Lemon, TGS without Tracy Jordan
is basically a puppet show.

392
00:15:31,896 --> 00:15:33,682
You know, I'm right here.

393
00:15:33,856 --> 00:15:37,103
Oh, why am I doing this
when I could be happy living in Cleveland?

394
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:38,391
What?

395
00:15:38,565 --> 00:15:39,983
Floyd and I are thinking of moving.

396
00:15:40,145 --> 00:15:40,893
- No, you're not.
- No, you're not.

397
00:15:41,068 --> 00:15:43,733
Look, every great getaway
has that moment when you want

398
00:15:43,908 --> 00:15:44,940
to pack it all in and stay.

399
00:15:45,116 --> 00:15:47,282
That's how I ended up
with a timeshare...

400
00:15:47,448 --> 00:15:48,780
in Port Arthur, Texas.

401
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:49,743
I don't think
that's what this is.

402
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:50,820
I mean, Floyd is pretty great.

403
00:15:50,996 --> 00:15:55,201
And, look, in Cleveland,
I'm a model.

404
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,702
Yeah, we're all models
west of the Allegheny.

405
00:15:58,878 --> 00:16:00,661
I'm serious about this.

406
00:16:00,837 --> 00:16:01,832
Maybe you should go.

407
00:16:02,007 --> 00:16:03,961
I mean, your head is obviously
not in the game lately.

408
00:16:04,136 --> 00:16:06,300
And now you've lost Tracy.
Maybe you're burned out.

409
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:07,841
What is this?

410
00:16:08,015 --> 00:16:10,300
This is Frank's "Hot Baby" sketch,
which is regrettable,

411
00:16:10,477 --> 00:16:13,180
but we have no Tracy Jordan
and a show in two days.

412
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:19,220
But, hey, that's not gonna be your problem
once you move to Ohio.

413
00:16:19,777 --> 00:16:22,022
No, you're not.

414
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:25,861
Frank, that's gonna get cut.

415
00:16:26,197 --> 00:16:26,902
Blurgh!

416
00:16:27,077 --> 00:16:28,533
Did you say anything to Jack?

417
00:16:28,695 --> 00:16:29,653
No, but I'm going to
if you don't.

418
00:16:29,825 --> 00:16:31,033
Oh, grow up, Liz.

419
00:16:31,206 --> 00:16:34,572
I didn't tell Jack where I was going 'cause
I didn't want him to get upset about nothing.

420
00:16:34,747 --> 00:16:36,330
That man was a former lover of mine.

421
00:16:36,498 --> 00:16:38,042
I was ending it with him, forever.

422
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:41,413
Uh-huh, and are all your ex-boyfriends
rich, older gentlemen?

423
00:16:41,587 --> 00:16:42,920
I care about Jack.

424
00:16:43,088 --> 00:16:45,333
I make him a better man.

425
00:16:45,508 --> 00:16:47,502
You know how John Lennon was better than
the rest of the Beatles,

426
00:16:47,676 --> 00:16:49,880
but didn't realize it
until he met Yoko Ono?

427
00:16:50,057 --> 00:16:51,421
Well, I'm Jack's Yoko.

428
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:52,883
You want to be Yoko?

429
00:16:53,057 --> 00:16:54,683
This is none of your business, anyway.

430
00:16:54,846 --> 00:16:55,642
I'm marrying Jack.

431
00:16:55,808 --> 00:16:56,970
He's everything I ever wanted.

432
00:16:57,148 --> 00:16:57,932
Oh, I bet he is.

433
00:16:58,108 --> 00:17:01,272
You don't know anything
about me, so back off!

434
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,941
What happened to your accent?

435
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:05,691
Um...

436
00:17:05,856 --> 00:17:07,692
I don't know what you're on about.

437
00:17:07,865 --> 00:17:10,942
You...daft wanker.

438
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:22,500
Hello?

439
00:17:22,668 --> 00:17:23,661
Hello, Liz Lemon.

440
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:26,001
It's me.

441
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,460
Stacy Gordon.

442
00:17:27,635 --> 00:17:29,551
Tracy, where are you calling from?

443
00:17:29,717 --> 00:17:31,001
I can't tell you that.

444
00:17:31,178 --> 00:17:32,552
I'm sorry, Liz Lemon.

445
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,933
I wanna thank you
for everything you've done.

446
00:17:35,098 --> 00:17:36,090
But I quit.

447
00:17:36,267 --> 00:17:37,682
For God's sakes, Tracy, where are you?

448
00:17:37,855 --> 00:17:39,262
Starting a new life.

449
00:17:39,436 --> 00:17:40,762
Because of the Black Crusaders?

450
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:42,220
That's crazy.

451
00:17:42,397 --> 00:17:44,023
Tray?

452
00:17:44,185 --> 00:17:50,733
Damn it, Lemon, why didn't you tell me
the Black Crusaders were after Tracy?

453
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,492
Surprisingly fast.

454
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,822
Oh.

455
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,793
I'm on it.

456
00:18:08,885 --> 00:18:11,171
I can't go to Cleveland.

457
00:18:11,345 --> 00:18:12,093
Hi.

458
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,800
Hi. I'm sorry.

459
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,220
I just, I've been thinking about this.

460
00:18:15,387 --> 00:18:16,262
And I think you're great.

461
00:18:16,436 --> 00:18:18,391
And obviously Cleveland is great.

462
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:20,892
But I can't move.

463
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:21,512
I know.

464
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:22,472
My life is here.

465
00:18:22,648 --> 00:18:23,432
My friends are here.

466
00:18:23,606 --> 00:18:24,562
The show is here.

467
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,773
And I've known you a month.

468
00:18:26,947 --> 00:18:28,273
Oh, you hate me right now, don't you?

469
00:18:28,448 --> 00:18:29,482
No.

470
00:18:29,657 --> 00:18:31,613
No, it was a crazy idea to begin with.

471
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,113
We were on a vacation high--

472
00:18:33,286 --> 00:18:33,903
Exactly.

473
00:18:34,078 --> 00:18:34,900
It's like a drug.

474
00:18:35,078 --> 00:18:37,911
Right-- if the whole world
moved to their favorite vacation spots,

475
00:18:38,078 --> 00:18:41,031
then the whole world would live in
Hawaii and Italy and Cleveland.

476
00:18:41,206 --> 00:18:42,453
Totally, I mean...

477
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:45,703
But just knowing that C-Town is out there
as an option for the future--

478
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:47,000
it's gonna make it
so much easier--

479
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:50,541
Liz... I took that job.

480
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,210
Blurgh.

481
00:18:59,186 --> 00:19:00,343
Did you locate Tracy?

482
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:02,803
Ugh, not yet.
I'm working on it.

483
00:19:02,977 --> 00:19:04,523
You know, you never answered
my question the other day.

484
00:19:04,687 --> 00:19:05,973
What do you think of Phoebe?

485
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,601
Honestly, I wish I had the guts
to do what you're doing.

486
00:19:08,778 --> 00:19:10,402
Just...going for it.

487
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,313
God bless.

488
00:19:12,487 --> 00:19:15,782
You still haven't answered my question.

489
00:19:15,945 --> 00:19:17,991
I...think she likes you a lot.

490
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:20,453
And I think she takes care of you.

491
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:23,332
And she's smart and pretty.

492
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,543
And completely wrong.

493
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,083
And she doesn't deserve you.

494
00:19:27,257 --> 00:19:30,210
I think she's weird,
and I don't like her,

495
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:31,921
and her ex-boyfriend is old.

496
00:19:32,085 --> 00:19:33,963
And I don't even think she's British!

497
00:19:34,136 --> 00:19:35,460
And you shouldn't marry her, Jack.

498
00:19:35,635 --> 00:19:39,013
Please don't marry her!

499
00:19:40,098 --> 00:19:42,551
Oh, my God.

500
00:19:42,727 --> 00:19:46,102
Lemon, Phoebe was right.
You are infatuated with me.

501
00:19:46,275 --> 00:19:46,971
What?

502
00:19:47,148 --> 00:19:48,272
No! No, no, no.

503
00:19:48,435 --> 00:19:49,983
Lemon, you are a wonderful woman.

504
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:51,980
And you deserve to be as happy as I am.

505
00:19:52,155 --> 00:19:53,692
Maybe with Floyd, right?

506
00:19:53,867 --> 00:19:56,652
No, don't mention Floyd.
Floyd is not happening.

507
00:19:56,825 --> 00:19:57,571
Floyd is moving.

508
00:19:57,737 --> 00:19:59,701
Floyd is moving?

509
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:00,742
What did you do?

510
00:20:00,905 --> 00:20:01,861
What did I do?

511
00:20:02,038 --> 00:20:03,530
I acted like a rational adult!

512
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,953
I didn't get engaged
to some gold digger,

513
00:20:06,126 --> 00:20:09,080
and then delude myself into thinking
that I could keep up with her.

514
00:20:09,256 --> 00:20:13,381
Yeah, Jack, I know that you fell asleep
on top of her in Paris.

515
00:20:13,548 --> 00:20:16,551
In Paris, France.

516
00:20:19,975 --> 00:20:23,303
I think you should go.

517
00:20:33,027 --> 00:20:37,651
Uh, Phoebe, darling,
Lemon was just leaving.

518
00:20:38,651 --> 00:20:48,651
