00:00:-11,-320 --> 00:00:-8,-160
- SIREN WAILS
- 'Octonauts, to your stations!'

2
00:00:-8,-160 --> 00:00:-5,-480
Barnacles!

3
00:00:-5,-480 --> 00:00:-4,-40
Kwazii!

4
00:00:-4,-40 --> 00:00:-2,-440
Peso!

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,200
- Explore!
- Rescue!
- Protect!

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,520
Octonauts!

7
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,400
CAPTAIN BARNACLES GRUNTS

8
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,640
We're all connected and ready to go, Cap.

9
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,280
Let's turn on the Octo-cam and see if it works.

10
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,720
Barnacles to Shellington, is the Octo-cam working?

11
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,680
Yes, Captain. The picture of the hermit crab

12
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,520
is coming in nice and clear.

13
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:08,880
No-one's explored this part of the ocean before. With this Octo-cam

14
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,520
- we can film the sea creatures who live here.
- Very good.

15
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,680
Barnacles out. Good work, Octonauts. Let's head back.

16
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,640
CAPTAIN BARNACLES WHISTLES

17
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,880
CLATTER

18
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,200
What's that sound?

19
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,720
Nothing, I guess.

20
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,800
BARNACLES RESUMES WHISTLING

21
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,600
CLATTER

22
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,480
HE RESUMES WHISTLING

23
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,440
CLATTER

24
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,960
That sound is coming from outside the GUP.

25
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,400
Is anybody out there?

26
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,160
Nobody but those tiny, skinny black fishes.

27
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,920
The GUP probably just needs a check up, Captain.

28
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,240
We'll be home soon and then you can take a look.

29
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,880
Have some food.

30
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,360
Thanks, Tunip. These fish biscuits are delicious.

31
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,960
- Fascinating.
- Brrrp!

32
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,680
How many sea stars are travelling together in this group? Let's see.

33
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,440
There's one, two... Huh?

34
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,440
I...

35
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,960
Come back! Captain!

36
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,960
- Something's wrong with the Octo-cam.
- Let me see what I can do.

37
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,120
It's not working.

38
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,720
Hm, that's strange. The Octo-cam was working perfectly when we left.

39
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,600
Cap, can you come down here?

40
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,800
There's something you've got to see to believe.

41
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,480
Check out these three perfectly round holes in the GUP.

42
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,680
What could have made those holes?

43
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,440
Not what, Captain - who? Look at this.

44
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,080
A whole set of teeth...

45
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,200
..Strong enough to take a bite out of the GUP.

46
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,000
Hm, first our GUP was damaged and now the Octo-cam isn't working.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,520
This smells fishy. Tweak, sound the Octo-alert.

48
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,800
- SIREN
- Octonauts, to the launch bay!

49
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,520
There's something wrong with the Octo-cam.

50
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,280
We've got to get back there.

51
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,960
I'll have those holes in the GUP-A fixed faster than you can say,

52
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,440
"bunch of munchy-crunchy carrots!"

53
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,880
Thanks. See if you can work out whose teeth these are

54
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,760
- while we check on the Octo-cam.
- All right.

55
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,720
What kind of animal would leave their teeth behind like that?

56
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,800
Don't worry, I'll get to the tooth - I mean truth!

57
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,920
CHUCKLES

58
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,360
This is a mystery and we've got to solve it.

59
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,720
Kwazii, Peso, into the GUP with me.

60
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,160
It's not working all right.

61
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,240
Not beeping or whirring or nothing.

62
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,480
And here's why - three holes in the rubber cable.

63
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,720
just like the holes in the GUP.

64
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,320
Three more holes here.

65
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,120
And here.

66
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,960
- Who's biting our equipment?
- Hm.

67
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,000
Captain, Kwazii, I've found another set of teeth.

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,880
Where?

69
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,560
Argh! They were here just a second ago.

70
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,120
Look!

71
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,200
It's gone.

72
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,240
There's nothing around but those skinny little fish.

73
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,680
It's like someone's playing tricks on us and then disappearing.

74
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,240
Who would do that?

75
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,560
I know, but I wish I didn't.

76
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,960
It is none other than the tri-toothed terror!

77
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,480
Who-toothed-what-er!

78
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,360
The tri-toothed terror - a giant sea monster

79
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,320
with three huge sharp teeth. He sneaks up on pirate ships,

80
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:08,440
bites them with his enormous teeth, then disappears into thin air!

81
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,840
You think the tri-toothed terror could be around here, following us?

82
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,600
I don't think we're dealing with the tri-toothed terror.

83
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,400
If it isn't the tri-toothed terror that made these holes, what was it?

84
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,320
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

85
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,920
Where's that coming from?

86
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,320
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

87
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,840
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

88
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,320
It's a blue whale.

89
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,720
Maybe he's seen something that could help us work this out.

90
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,280
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

91
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,520
- Excuse me, but...
- Hoo-hoo-ha-ha!

92
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,960
What's so funny? Is my eye patch crooked?

93
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,280
Something's tickling my blubber, but I can't tell what.

94
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,280
wish it would stop now. Hoo-hoo-hoo!

95
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,960
Can you help me? It's down by my tail.

96
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,400
Ah, we've seen these marks before.

97
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,800
It's under my chin now!

98
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,840
- Hmm!
- That scurvy tri-toothed terror must be nearby, but where?

99
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,240
Hoo-hoo! I've got to get out of here!

100
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,960
- Hold on to me!
- OTHERS: Whoa!

101
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,000
Ha-ha-ha!

102
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,080
Ooh!

103
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,560
Whoa! That was a wild ride!

104
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:35,120
- I wish I knew who was tickling me.
- I think the creature who gave you the giggles

105
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,200
is the same one giving us trouble.

106
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,160
It left more of them tiny round marks in your blubber.

107
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,280
Don't worry. the Octonauts will find the troublemaker and stop him.

108
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:55,600
Ah. No, too big. Too small. Too thin. No, no, no. Wait a minute!

109
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,040
There, that's it.

110
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,920
'Captain, I know whose teeth these are.'

111
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,200
- Great work.
- 'They're called cookiecutter sharks.

112
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,440
'They dig their teeth into a whale's blubber and leave round holes,

113
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,000
'the way a cookiecutter leaves a shape in dough or pastry.'

114
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,080
They went after the blue whale as they wanted a bite of his blubber.

115
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,760
Why did the wee sharks attack the Octo-cam cables?

116
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:25,440
'They get confused and mistake soft material like rubber for blubber.'

117
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,680
- Rubber...
- ..For blubber!

118
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,760
We've got to ask them to stop biting our equipment.

119
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,360
First we need to catch these rubber, blubber lovers

120
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,920
and I have an idea.

121
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,520
Barnacles to Tweak. We're going to need your help.

122
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,960
FISH SCREECH

123
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,640
Hey, Cap, you ordered a big rubber whale balloon?

124
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:58,280
Thanks, Tweak. Let's set it up near the Octo-cam - then everybody hide.

125
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,520
- KWAZII SNORES
- Eh?

126
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,600
FAINT SQUEAKING

127
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,200
POP!

128
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,960
SHARKS: Hey-ho. Go!

129
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,400
Stop right there, you nasty nibblers!

130
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,040
SHARKS: Whoa!

131
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,840
We've got you now.

132
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,240
Caught us! I'm innocent! I wasn't even there!

133
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,880
You took bites out of our equipment and broke it.

134
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,360
Oh, that. Look, we're cookiecutter sharks.

135
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,480
We thought your equipment was food so we took a nibble. Sorry.

136
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,720
- Yes, sorry!
- Sorry about that. Sorry!

137
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,080
PESO: But how did you keep hiding from us?

138
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,520
Uh... Oh...

139
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,280
Yeow! Clamming up, are you?

140
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,800
OK, OK, we'll show you how we do it.

141
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,680
Your bellies glow, so when we're looking at them from below

142
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,040
they blend in with the sunlight.

143
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,480
And all you see are those black marks

144
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,040
that make them look like skinny fish.

145
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,400
So that's why nobody can see you from below.

146
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,960
- We can't fool you anymore.
- No, absolutely no fooling you at all!

147
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,440
Why did you leave your teeth in our GUP? Don't you need them?

148
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,200
Our teeth come out in whole rows like that...

149
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,240
..And grow back really quickly.

150
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,720
PESO: What about the teeth that disappeared?

151
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,800
I put them down and they were gone.

152
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,480
- The teeth disappeared because I ate them.
- You ate your own teeth?

153
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,280
That doesn't sound healthy.

154
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,000
It is if you're a cookiecutter shark.

155
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,080
Our teeth have lots of vitamins in them.

156
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,800
So the mystery is solved,

157
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,400
but could you please stop nibbling on our equipment?

158
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,000
OK, OK, but we'd really like a snack about now.

159
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,880
Oh, yes. We're really hungry.
