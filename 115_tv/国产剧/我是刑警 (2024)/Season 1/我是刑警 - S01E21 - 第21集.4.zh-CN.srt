1
00:00:07,154 --> 00:00:08,893
We came as soon
as we got your message.

2
00:00:09,221 --> 00:00:12,220
- What's the problem?
- There's something you both need to see.

3
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,716
<i>Almost had me that time, Conner.</i>

4
00:00:24,326 --> 00:00:25,746
<i>You deserve a reward.</i>

5
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:48,042


6
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,936
<b> Season 1, episode 21
“Image”</b>

7
00:00:57,483 --> 00:00:58,850
- Dinah!
- Freeze playback!

8
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,527
That never happened!

9
00:01:00,847 --> 00:01:02,610
You need to keep watching.
Play!

10
00:01:07,295 --> 00:01:08,616
Freeze playback.

11
00:01:09,223 --> 00:01:10,970
Don't you laugh!

12
00:01:11,325 --> 00:01:12,835
She and...
He and...

13
00:01:12,985 --> 00:01:14,618
Oliver, this is not funny!

14
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:16,990
No... no,
of course not.

15
00:01:17,048 --> 00:01:18,409
Please, understand.

16
00:01:18,892 --> 00:01:20,970
On Mars,
this is a common game.

17
00:01:21,345 --> 00:01:22,901
My people, all shape-shift.

18
00:01:23,094 --> 00:01:24,522
But also read minds.

19
00:01:24,941 --> 00:01:27,144
So, no one is ever mislead.

20
00:01:27,631 --> 00:01:30,863
And I am certain Conner knew
he was with M'gann from the very first.

21
00:01:31,268 --> 00:01:32,930
We are not on Mars,
J'onn!

22
00:01:33,492 --> 00:01:34,796
No...

23
00:01:34,797 --> 00:01:38,526
But my niece does not understand
things are different on Earth.

24
00:01:39,205 --> 00:01:41,511
Then I'll make her understand.

25
00:01:48,436 --> 00:01:49,928
<i>Hello, Megan!</i>

26
00:01:50,846 --> 00:01:52,001
M'gann!

27
00:01:52,629 --> 00:01:54,029
Just a sec!

28
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,056
Uh... OK.

29
00:01:58,199 --> 00:01:59,328
Come in!

30
00:02:05,354 --> 00:02:07,321
So, you can see that,
among humans,

31
00:02:07,697 --> 00:02:10,078
that game could be
very hurtful.

32
00:02:10,676 --> 00:02:13,477
I'm sorry...
I'm really sorry!

33
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:16,101
I'm not upset...

34
00:02:16,217 --> 00:02:17,659
...anymore!

35
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,961
But please, M'gann,
from now on,

36
00:02:20,156 --> 00:02:21,654
just be yourself.

37
00:02:21,713 --> 00:02:23,063
This IS myself!

38
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:25,740
This IS who I am.

39
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:28,663
<i>Robin, Kid Flash,
Superboy, Miss Martian.</i>

40
00:02:28,891 --> 00:02:30,295
<i>Report for mission briefing.</i>

41
00:02:31,641 --> 00:02:35,610
Rumaan Harjavti is the democratically
elected President of Qurac.

42
00:02:36,381 --> 00:02:39,668
Harjavti has been praised
as a fair, wise leader.

43
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:40,965
A humanitarian.

44
00:02:40,976 --> 00:02:44,357
Sure, any friend of Bruce Wayne's...

45
00:02:44,893 --> 00:02:46,343
But five days ago...

46
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:50,806
Harjavti allied himself with the dictator
of the neighboring nation of Bialya.

47
00:02:51,044 --> 00:02:52,453
Queen Bee.

48
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,846
- Not a fan.
- Few are.

49
00:02:55,238 --> 00:02:58,475
But Harjavti suddenly backs
Queen Bee's baseless claim

50
00:02:58,476 --> 00:03:01,905
that Qurac and Bialya
were one nation in ancient times.

51
00:03:02,173 --> 00:03:04,751
And has announced
the countries will reunify

52
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:07,293
in two days
at a ceremony in Qurac.

53
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:11,289
<i>After the ceremony,
I will step down as President</i>

54
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:14,327
<i>so that our rightful monarch,
Queen Bee, may rule.</i>

55
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,033
<i>I laud president Harjavti
for unifying our peoples</i>

56
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,547
<i>and I will gladly come to Qurac</i>

57
00:03:21,548 --> 00:03:24,873
<i>to be crowned
sole leader of our nation.</i>

58
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,857
And the Quracies are OK with this?

59
00:03:27,272 --> 00:03:28,384
Hardly.

60
00:03:29,174 --> 00:03:31,878
They're well aware of the brutality
of Queen Bee's regime

61
00:03:32,059 --> 00:03:35,032
But Harjavti has censored the press,
silenced all legitimate protesting

62
00:03:35,033 --> 00:03:37,839
and invited the Bialyan military
into his country,

63
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:39,539
to enforce Martial Law.

64
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,879
Queen Bee
has to be controlling Harjavti.

65
00:03:42,278 --> 00:03:44,269
Doesn't she have the power
to enthrall most men?

66
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,832
And some women.

67
00:03:45,981 --> 00:03:47,033
But not long distanced.

68
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,583
And we have confirmation
she hasn't left Bialya.

69
00:03:49,778 --> 00:03:51,422
Something else is at work here.

70
00:03:51,952 --> 00:03:53,179
Find out what.

71
00:03:53,464 --> 00:03:55,088
Robin, you're team leader.

72
00:03:55,573 --> 00:03:56,939
Promotion! Sweet!

73
00:03:56,996 --> 00:03:58,700
Me?
What about Aqualad?

74
00:03:58,782 --> 00:04:00,132
Busy helping Aquaman.

75
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:01,577
You're the next logical choice.

76
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:04,769
- Great...
- Dude! You totally left me hanging!

77
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,858
We're right above
the Quraci-Bialyan border.

78
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:15,492
A border the Bialyans
are in the process of ignoring.

79
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:33,101
No opposition.
I guess Harjavti really is in bed with Bialya.

80
00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:36,132
I wouldn't expect opposition here.
It's an animal sanctuary.

81
00:04:36,184 --> 00:04:37,834
The Logan Animal Sanctuary?

82
00:04:37,912 --> 00:04:39,195
You've heard of it?

83
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,622
Guys...
Tanks have caused a stampede.

84
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:44,571
The civilians in herd's way!

85
00:04:44,586 --> 00:04:46,584
I see them.
A woman and a small boy.

86
00:04:46,622 --> 00:04:49,245
- We have to help them!
- We're way off mission here!

87
00:04:50,848 --> 00:04:52,348
Deploy.
But stealth mode!

88
00:04:52,349 --> 00:04:55,335
If the Bialyans know we've hit them,
this becomes an international incident.

89
00:05:25,561 --> 00:05:26,851
Oryx!

90
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,637
- Wow!
- Are you both alright?

91
00:05:40,227 --> 00:05:41,886
Mom.
Mom! Mom!

92
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,518
We were just saved by Robin.
And Kid Flash!

93
00:05:45,999 --> 00:05:47,931
Course, Superboy and Miss Martian
helped too!

94
00:05:48,122 --> 00:05:49,269
Oryx!

95
00:05:50,155 --> 00:05:51,774
We diverted the Bialyans
around the sanctuary.

96
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,463
You should be safe now.

97
00:05:53,663 --> 00:05:55,840
Uh... yeah!
Coast has cleared, Miss M.!

98
00:05:55,961 --> 00:05:57,165
You can decamo now.

99
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:00,601
H-hi!

100
00:06:02,114 --> 00:06:03,508
You may have made things worse.

101
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:05,990
Bialyan border-crossings
are a way of life here.

102
00:06:06,368 --> 00:06:08,488
Usually, they wreck a few fences
and move on.

103
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,429
Engaging them
might have made us a target.

104
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:11,659
Mom...

105
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,207
Uncool!

106
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,474
I'm sorry...
I should thank you.

107
00:06:17,528 --> 00:06:18,820
This is my son, Garfield.

108
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,515
- I'm...
- Marie Logan!

109
00:06:20,571 --> 00:06:22,419
I can't believe I'm actually
meeting you in person!

110
00:06:22,444 --> 00:06:25,704
I've... I've admired your stands

111
00:06:25,705 --> 00:06:27,644
on animal rights for years.

112
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:29,669
You've only been on Earth
six months!

113
00:06:35,611 --> 00:06:38,527
The oryx is sick.
And I think you injured this wildebeest.

114
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:40,230
Uh... sorry?

115
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,224
I suppose it was unavoidable.

116
00:06:42,577 --> 00:06:44,226
But both need to go
to our clinic.

117
00:06:44,455 --> 00:06:46,716
The boys can do that!
You and I can...

118
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,649
- Fix your fences!
- That's not exactly our...

119
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,461
- Robin...
- Please, Mom!

120
00:06:51,402 --> 00:06:53,100
- Fine.
- Yes!

121
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:02,951
Hey, get it off!

122
00:07:04,997 --> 00:07:06,909
It's OK...
Meet Monkey!

123
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,092
Good name!
But I hate monkeys.

124
00:07:11,592 --> 00:07:13,106
Looks like Monkey hates Superboys.

125
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,770
Dude, be glad
he only threw a proteine bar.

126
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,838
So... Pretty weird about
Miss Martian and my mom, huh?

127
00:07:24,127 --> 00:07:27,334
- What do you mean?
- I mean she looks exactly like Marie.

128
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,278
- You know, except greener.
- She does?

129
00:07:29,299 --> 00:07:30,503
Well, duh!

130
00:07:30,504 --> 00:07:33,102
Especially back when Mom was a TV star
in "Hello, Megan!"

131
00:07:33,313 --> 00:07:35,604
Wait...
"Hello, Megan!" is a TV show?

132
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,684
I just thought it was
something she says all the time.

133
00:07:37,816 --> 00:07:40,421
Yeah...
On the TV show!

134
00:07:40,506 --> 00:07:41,740
Way before we were born.

135
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:44,633
Only one season!
You can't even find it online.

136
00:07:45,254 --> 00:07:47,570
I know Mom has a tape somewhere...

137
00:07:56,598 --> 00:07:58,189
Well, you're certainly a time-saver.

138
00:07:59,976 --> 00:08:01,196
How was it?

139
00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:02,499
Being Megan?

140
00:08:02,821 --> 00:08:04,099
"Being Megan"?

141
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:06,633
I don't know, I was young.
It was fun.

142
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,802
Remember that time when you were
supposed to make cookies for the big sale

143
00:08:08,812 --> 00:08:12,051
only you thought it would be faster
to make one giant cookie and...

144
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,970
Listen!
"Hello, Megan!" was a job.

145
00:08:13,977 --> 00:08:16,736
The person you saw on TV
isn't who I am.

146
00:08:20,004 --> 00:08:22,444
"Hello, Megan!"
The pilot episode.

147
00:08:24,624 --> 00:08:26,538
Wow!
You still have VHS!

148
00:08:26,871 --> 00:08:28,081
Where is your 8-track?

149
00:08:28,084 --> 00:08:29,334
Wait!

150
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,304
Aircraft!
Headed this way.

151
00:08:32,423 --> 00:08:34,115
Gar!
Stay put.

152
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,042
What is it?

153
00:08:47,216 --> 00:08:49,569
- Where is my son?
- I ordered him to stay inside.

154
00:08:49,813 --> 00:08:51,944
He's eight!
He doesn't do "orders"!

155
00:08:52,552 --> 00:08:53,872
Mom!

156
00:08:54,448 --> 00:08:56,606
It's OK,
I got the animals out!

157
00:09:00,008 --> 00:09:01,359
Garfield!

158
00:09:24,411 --> 00:09:26,126
I told you
there'd be consequences!

159
00:09:26,801 --> 00:09:28,052
Always!

160
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,320
Let's get him inside.

161
00:09:46,116 --> 00:09:47,285
He's in shock.

162
00:09:47,802 --> 00:09:49,660
He needs a blood transfusion,
now.

163
00:09:49,811 --> 00:09:51,236
Is either of you O negative?

164
00:09:51,349 --> 00:09:52,615
No, I'm sorry.

165
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,867
Neither am I.
It's the hardest to match.

166
00:09:55,205 --> 00:09:56,536
I've kept a supply in the clinic...

167
00:09:56,889 --> 00:09:58,436
I can run into the nearest hospital...

168
00:09:58,584 --> 00:10:00,297
The nearest hospital with
this type of blood supply,

169
00:10:00,298 --> 00:10:02,061
half an hour away,
at your top speed.

170
00:10:02,113 --> 00:10:03,334
Longer, by Bio-Ship!

171
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,795
He doesn't have that much time!

172
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,358
What's Superboy's blood type?

173
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:07,674
He's Kryptonian.

174
00:10:07,827 --> 00:10:09,601
- And Miss Martian...
- Might be able to help.

175
00:10:10,178 --> 00:10:12,588
My shape-shifting occurs
at the cellular level.

176
00:10:14,264 --> 00:10:16,312
I think I can modify blood
to match his.

177
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:17,989
Please, try!

178
00:10:19,551 --> 00:10:21,935
I'll need to concentrate.
No distractions.

179
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,395
Out!
All of you, out!

180
00:10:51,654 --> 00:10:52,785
I'm ready.

181
00:10:54,677 --> 00:10:57,514
And on top of all this,
Harjavti steps down tomorrow.

182
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,463
Subjecting all of Qurac to this danger.

183
00:11:00,206 --> 00:11:01,727
KF, can you find a news station?

184
00:11:01,936 --> 00:11:03,417
Sure.
Which remote is it?

185
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,360
<i>~Hello, Megan!~</i>

186
00:11:08,561 --> 00:11:11,241
<i>~School and boys and parents too,~</i>

187
00:11:11,336 --> 00:11:13,964
<i>~A whole lot to juggle
from Miss You-Know-Who~</i>

188
00:11:14,825 --> 00:11:16,791
<i>~Hello, Megan~</i>

189
00:11:17,573 --> 00:11:19,287
<i>~Hello, Megan!~</i>

190
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,666
<i>~This cheerleader knows the score,~</i>

191
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:24,553
<i>~Center of attention
and so much more,~</i>

192
00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:27,101
<i>~Hello, Megan,~</i>

193
00:11:27,897 --> 00:11:29,763
<i>~Hello, Megan...~</i>

194
00:11:30,294 --> 00:11:32,391
<i>~A little bit distractable,
but never too ***~</i>

195
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:35,299
<i>~She's really quite attractable,
OK, a lot distractable,~</i>

196
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,904
<i>~Eventually, she'll get a ***~</i>

197
00:11:37,987 --> 00:11:39,517
<i>~Hello, Megan!~</i>

198
00:11:39,581 --> 00:11:41,983
<i>~The girl for me,
The girl for you...~</i>

199
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,573
<i>~Hello, Megan,~</i>

200
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:47,030
<i>~Hello, Megan!~</i>

201
00:11:47,103 --> 00:11:49,517
<i>~The girl for me,
The girl for you,~</i>

202
00:11:50,814 --> 00:11:52,380
Maybe it's a coincidence.

203
00:11:53,577 --> 00:11:55,110
<i>~Hello, Megan!~</i>

204
00:11:55,675 --> 00:11:57,912
<i>~Hello, Megan!~</i>

205
00:12:01,131 --> 00:12:03,366
<i>Mom, I'm going to the library,
to study!</i>

206
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:07,042
<i>But didn't you invite a certain someone
"to study"...?</i>

207
00:12:07,169 --> 00:12:08,503
<i>...Here?</i>

208
00:12:09,498 --> 00:12:11,132
<i>Hello, Megan!</i>

209
00:12:17,502 --> 00:12:19,068
<i>Conner!</i>

210
00:12:20,942 --> 00:12:22,555
<i>I thought
you'd never get here!</i>

211
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,671
Oh, yeah,
"pure coincidence"...

212
00:12:27,825 --> 00:12:30,068
It's done.
All we can do now is wait.

213
00:12:31,832 --> 00:12:33,245
<i>My fellow Quracians,</i>

214
00:12:34,395 --> 00:12:35,668
Is that Harjavti?

215
00:12:35,806 --> 00:12:37,883
<i>Queen Bee's rule
is a gift to Qurac</i>

216
00:12:37,905 --> 00:12:39,327
Hey, that guy in back!

217
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:40,519
I know him!

218
00:12:42,015 --> 00:12:45,240
It's Psimon! The psychic we fought
last time we were in Bialya!

219
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,202
He was working
for Queen Bee then,

220
00:12:47,203 --> 00:12:48,796
he must be controlling Harjavti
for her now!

221
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:51,827
I still remember the headache
from when he brain-blasted us.

222
00:12:51,828 --> 00:12:53,892
We have to get Harjavti
away from him.

223
00:12:54,828 --> 00:12:57,007
I think it worked.
Garfield is stable.

224
00:12:57,796 --> 00:12:59,595
Good.
Because, we have our mission.

225
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:14,734
Harjavti is alone.

226
00:13:22,494 --> 00:13:24,070
Where's my daughter?

227
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:26,785
- Where is Psimon?
- Forget him.

228
00:13:26,975 --> 00:13:28,341
Let's get you out of here.

229
00:13:34,091 --> 00:13:35,374
Well, well...

230
00:13:35,394 --> 00:13:37,042
American heroes...

231
00:13:37,388 --> 00:13:39,391
Here, to assasinate the President.

232
00:13:39,856 --> 00:13:42,547
Such a shame
we arrived too late to stop them...

233
00:13:42,851 --> 00:13:44,401
<i>Those are Apokoliptian weapons.</i>

234
00:13:44,479 --> 00:13:46,385
<i>Which they'll use to kill Harjavti,</i>

235
00:13:46,386 --> 00:13:49,385
<i>we get cleaned
and Queen Bee gets to rule Qurac!</i>

236
00:13:49,448 --> 00:13:50,788
<i>Full roundup around the President!</i>

237
00:13:51,717 --> 00:13:53,004
<i>I found Psimon!</i>

238
00:13:53,026 --> 00:13:54,337
<i>- Wait!
- I'll get her!</i>

239
00:13:54,372 --> 00:13:56,567
<i>No!
The mission is Harjavti.</i>

240
00:14:09,511 --> 00:14:11,117
<i>Indeed, it is...</i>

241
00:14:11,118 --> 00:14:14,472
<i>Am I the only one to learn anything
from our previous encounter?</i>

242
00:14:14,843 --> 00:14:16,551
<i>You didn't think that,
maybe,</i>

243
00:14:16,552 --> 00:14:19,339
<i>if you could sense me,
I could sense you too?</i>

244
00:14:19,716 --> 00:14:23,814
<i>Or that this time I'll be ready
to use your greatest fear against you?</i>

245
00:14:25,536 --> 00:14:27,372
<i>"Psimon says..."</i>

246
00:14:27,737 --> 00:14:31,648
<i>Show me who...
or rather what you really are...</i>

247
00:14:33,395 --> 00:14:35,250
<i>No, no, no!</i>

248
00:14:35,415 --> 00:14:36,980
<i>This IS who I am!</i>

249
00:14:51,562 --> 00:14:53,273
Thank you for saving my father.

250
00:14:53,444 --> 00:14:54,942
We will take care of him now.

251
00:14:56,174 --> 00:14:57,556
<i>M'gann, we're coming!</i>

252
00:15:00,134 --> 00:15:03,255
<i>"Psimon says",
smartly done!</i>

253
00:15:03,723 --> 00:15:05,538
<i>Brain-blasting your own team...</i>

254
00:15:05,724 --> 00:15:08,327
<i>I had no idea
you'd go to such lengths</i>

255
00:15:08,328 --> 00:15:11,086
<i>to hide your true self
from your good friends.</i>

256
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,926
<i>Oh, actually, I did.</i>

257
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,095
<i>But you needn't have bothered.</i>

258
00:15:15,096 --> 00:15:17,381
<i>It's been recorded for posterity.</i>

259
00:15:17,938 --> 00:15:19,421
<i>No...!</i>

260
00:15:21,593 --> 00:15:22,910
<i>Uh-ah-ah!</i>

261
00:15:22,975 --> 00:15:25,045
<i>I didn't say,
"Psimon says!"</i>

262
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:50,531
<i>Come, now...</i>

263
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,861
<i>We both know
that's not who you really are...</i>

264
00:15:53,017 --> 00:15:55,883
<i>Must you even lie to yourself,
whithin your own mind?</i>

265
00:15:56,093 --> 00:15:58,792
It's not a lie!
This IS who I am!

266
00:16:03,037 --> 00:16:05,957
<i>Wow...
And they say I'm pathological...</i>

267
00:16:12,915 --> 00:16:14,903
Off our game, are we ?

268
00:16:14,904 --> 00:16:18,558
Let's take it a little deeper,
find out what we're really afraid of.

269
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:26,813
<i>Keep back!</i>

270
00:16:28,147 --> 00:16:29,777
<i>Well, of course...</i>

271
00:16:29,778 --> 00:16:32,158
<i>Friends and teammates
shrink from you in fear.</i>

272
00:16:33,483 --> 00:16:35,845
<i>You should have told us
the truth.</i>

273
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,342
<i>I don't see
how we could trust you now.</i>

274
00:16:39,342 --> 00:16:41,755
<i>Then you're kept off the pep squad.</i>

275
00:16:42,175 --> 00:16:44,055
<i>I am sorry, M'gann.</i>

276
00:16:44,232 --> 00:16:47,335
<i>But there is no place for you
on Earth now.</i>

277
00:16:49,781 --> 00:16:52,472
<i>Oh, there is none on Mars too!</i>

278
00:16:57,098 --> 00:16:59,643
<i>And even that's not the worst,
is it?</i>

279
00:17:02,706 --> 00:17:05,577
<i>No, please...
stop!</i>

280
00:17:08,412 --> 00:17:09,763
<i>"Love you"?</i>

281
00:17:09,844 --> 00:17:11,893
<i>I can't even look at you!</i>

282
00:17:16,163 --> 00:17:19,930
Oh, what you wouldn't do
to prevent that, now right?

283
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:22,372
<i>That's right...</i>

284
00:17:25,482 --> 00:17:26,840
Now, now, my pretty...

285
00:17:26,841 --> 00:17:29,373
I know you don't want to do
anything you'll regret...

286
00:17:29,435 --> 00:17:31,391
<i>You don't know me at all!</i>

287
00:17:41,366 --> 00:17:42,545
Conner?

288
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:43,996
Are you OK?

289
00:17:46,952 --> 00:17:48,735
And there's the headache...

290
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:50,366
Psimon...?

291
00:17:51,168 --> 00:17:52,509
He brain-blasted you.

292
00:17:52,527 --> 00:17:53,730
I stopped him.

293
00:18:05,315 --> 00:18:08,019
What do you mean,
"The President won't see me"?

294
00:18:08,266 --> 00:18:09,762
He invited me!

295
00:18:09,983 --> 00:18:11,923
Not of my free will!

296
00:18:12,142 --> 00:18:14,731
No!
But now, that I am free,

297
00:18:14,892 --> 00:18:16,525
of your minion's thrall,

298
00:18:16,907 --> 00:18:19,546
<i>the Quraci people
will never suffer</i>

299
00:18:19,547 --> 00:18:21,354
<i>your tyrannical rule!</i>

300
00:18:25,717 --> 00:18:27,282
Mark me, Harjavti!

301
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,411
You will suffer for this!

302
00:18:29,668 --> 00:18:31,455
Qurac will be mine!

303
00:18:37,927 --> 00:18:39,835
Sorry you had to lie everyone
like that.

304
00:18:39,941 --> 00:18:41,172
But I couldn't think of any other way

305
00:18:41,173 --> 00:18:43,364
to convince the public
Queen Bee was behind this.

306
00:18:43,518 --> 00:18:45,859
Dude...
Saving a country...

307
00:18:45,902 --> 00:18:48,569
Pretty big way for your first turn
as "leader"...

308
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,186
Yeah...
Thanks.

309
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:56,306
<i>And, I assure you,</i>

310
00:18:56,307 --> 00:18:59,311
<i>The Wayne Foundation is here
to do whatever it can</i>

311
00:18:59,312 --> 00:19:02,315
<i>to help you and your people
rebuild Qurac.</i>

312
00:19:03,953 --> 00:19:06,255
<i>Gee,
Bruce Wayne surely got here fast.</i>

313
00:19:06,456 --> 00:19:08,028
Almost like he knew...

314
00:19:08,029 --> 00:19:10,826
Don't you have a souvenir to collect,
or something?

315
00:19:10,903 --> 00:19:12,298
"Hello, Megan!"

316
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:18,352
Something you'd like to tell us?

317
00:19:25,444 --> 00:19:27,472
Growing up on Mars was...

318
00:19:27,504 --> 00:19:29,254
Not a happy time for me.

319
00:19:29,478 --> 00:19:32,307
But I started watching the broadcast
my uncle sent from Earth...

320
00:19:32,411 --> 00:19:33,996
To teach us about our sister planet...

321
00:19:34,232 --> 00:19:35,885
When I saw "Hello, Megan!"...

322
00:19:35,918 --> 00:19:37,670
Something just...clicked.

323
00:19:37,731 --> 00:19:39,789
Maybe it was
the similaties in our names...

324
00:19:39,807 --> 00:19:42,903
Maybe it was the way all Megan's
problems could be solved in 22 minutes.

325
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,945
All I know for sure is...

326
00:19:45,028 --> 00:19:47,473
That Megan helped me smile
through a lonely childhood.

327
00:19:47,516 --> 00:19:49,458
So, when I came to Earth...

328
00:19:49,566 --> 00:19:51,600
And had to adopt a human form...

329
00:19:51,677 --> 00:19:53,470
I chose you.

330
00:19:54,199 --> 00:19:55,477
Well...

331
00:19:55,493 --> 00:19:56,732
Megan.

332
00:19:58,241 --> 00:19:59,886
Which begs the question...

333
00:20:00,431 --> 00:20:01,783
What do you really look like?

334
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:12,556
Bald M'gann...

335
00:20:12,641 --> 00:20:13,920
Still hot!

336
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,901
You know, you don't have to
put on the mask for me.

337
00:20:21,232 --> 00:20:22,514
I do it for me.

338
00:20:22,981 --> 00:20:24,352
This is who I am.

339
00:20:24,427 --> 00:20:25,634
Inside.

340
00:20:26,123 --> 00:20:27,494
Please, don't be mad.

341
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:30,582
Mad?
I'm honored.

342
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:33,000
M'gann, you saved my son.

343
00:20:33,144 --> 00:20:35,083
He says he's you blood-brother now.

344
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,412
And I agree.
You're family!

345
00:20:40,925 --> 00:20:43,686
Thank you!
You can't know what that means to me.

346
00:20:51,053 --> 00:20:52,337
Garfield?

347
00:20:56,412 --> 00:20:59,469
Shh! It would be a shame
to wake him.

348
00:20:59,817 --> 00:21:02,404
I might have to order
my little thrall here

349
00:21:02,405 --> 00:21:04,484
to damage himself.

350
00:21:05,843 --> 00:21:09,609
Uh-uh! He already has orders
to do just that

351
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:12,082
if anything happens to me.

352
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:16,356
Now...
Your performance...

353
00:21:16,457 --> 00:21:18,480
A bit over the top,
I think,

354
00:21:18,481 --> 00:21:21,056
but then,
you haven't practised me

355
00:21:21,057 --> 00:21:22,509
the way you've perfected

356
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,544
the role of "Megan".

357
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,620
That's right...

358
00:21:28,005 --> 00:21:30,094
Poor Psimon
is not the only one

359
00:21:30,095 --> 00:21:32,373
who knows your true from.

360
00:21:32,635 --> 00:21:34,494
And, if you don't cooperate,

361
00:21:34,953 --> 00:21:37,474
I'll make sure
everyone knows

362
00:21:37,475 --> 00:21:40,224
what you really are.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
