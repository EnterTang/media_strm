1
00:00:27,188 --> 00:00:28,520
Times like these...

2
00:00:28,563 --> 00:00:30,838
One feels
the very weight of the world upon us.

3
00:00:34,502 --> 00:00:35,759
Everyone is here.

4
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:51,591
Our agenda is clear.

5
00:00:51,882 --> 00:00:54,618
What's at stake
should not be underestimated.

6
00:00:54,704 --> 00:00:57,750
The decisions we make today
will reverberate for years to come.

7
00:00:57,886 --> 00:01:00,619
And influence whether or not
the world continues to put their trust

8
00:01:00,622 --> 00:01:01,893
in the Justice League.

9
00:01:01,902 --> 00:01:03,423
Please, take your seats.

10
00:01:03,891 --> 00:01:05,628
We have work to do.

11
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:25,046


12
00:01:25,072 --> 00:01:28,210
<b> Season 1, episode 22
“Agendas”</b>

13
00:01:31,605 --> 00:01:33,709
Another expansion of the League

14
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,829
could generate another escalation
of hostilities from our enemies.

15
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,735
No one needs or wants
another Injustice League.

16
00:01:40,756 --> 00:01:44,385
Point taken. But the option remains
to vote no one or all candidates.

17
00:01:44,613 --> 00:01:45,964
So...

18
00:01:45,965 --> 00:01:47,997
I nominate Icon
for League membership.

19
00:01:49,233 --> 00:01:51,687
Why, because you suspect Icon
might be Kryptonian,

20
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:53,178
like you did with Captain Marvel?

21
00:01:53,215 --> 00:01:55,743
You thought I was Kryptonian?
Cool!

22
00:01:56,443 --> 00:01:58,441
Icon interests me also.

23
00:01:58,442 --> 00:02:00,784
As does his protégé,
Rocket.

24
00:02:01,091 --> 00:02:04,012
Athena knows the League
could use more female members.

25
00:02:04,168 --> 00:02:05,574
- Agreed.
- Hear, hear!

26
00:02:09,784 --> 00:02:11,615
Gabble, gabble!

27
00:02:14,543 --> 00:02:17,322
Aw, I love Thanksgiving!

28
00:02:18,444 --> 00:02:20,891
- Ow!
- Those are for dinner, Wally!

29
00:02:24,798 --> 00:02:27,559
There, seasoned to perfection
and ready for the oven!

30
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,390
Wally, I thought
you were eating with your family!

31
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,389
Oh, yeah,
Dad will kill me if I'm late!

32
00:02:34,783 --> 00:02:36,012
See ya!

33
00:02:36,084 --> 00:02:37,359
Wally!

34
00:02:40,237 --> 00:02:42,627
It's nothing.
The onions...

35
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,301
These are all the things
I used to cook for...

36
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:48,609
It's my first Thanksgiving
without my Dad.

37
00:02:51,332 --> 00:02:52,791
At least she had a Dad.

38
00:02:56,524 --> 00:02:58,142
<i>With Superman off world,</i>

39
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:00,535
<i>only one thing alive
with less than four legs</i>

40
00:03:00,536 --> 00:03:02,447
<i>can hear this frequency,
Superboy.</i>

41
00:03:02,688 --> 00:03:04,002
<i>And that's you.</i>

42
00:03:04,415 --> 00:03:07,257
<i>Meet me in Washington DC,
East Potomac Park.</i>

43
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:08,488
<i>Come alone.</i>

44
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:10,915
<i>I promise,
it will be worth the trip.</i>

45
00:03:14,132 --> 00:03:15,387
Conner?

46
00:03:15,392 --> 00:03:17,375
Figured you don't want my help
in the kitchen.

47
00:03:17,429 --> 00:03:18,827
Remember the last time?

48
00:03:18,981 --> 00:03:20,552
When the...
Yeah. But...

49
00:03:20,604 --> 00:03:22,469
Just walking Wolf.
No big.

50
00:03:25,749 --> 00:03:27,846
Seriously?
The Atom?

51
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:29,922
How useful could he be
at that size?

52
00:03:30,006 --> 00:03:32,401
It's the size
that makes him useful.

53
00:03:32,442 --> 00:03:33,728
Absolutely.

54
00:03:33,768 --> 00:03:35,925
Still, we could always use
more raw power.

55
00:03:35,967 --> 00:03:37,964
And Earth has
a third Green Lantern.

56
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,740
- Guy Gardner.
- No!

57
00:03:39,808 --> 00:03:41,254
- But we could really...
- No!

58
00:04:02,027 --> 00:04:04,473
Superboy...
My name is Lex Luthor.

59
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,285
I'm the new Chairman
of the Board for Project Cadmus.

60
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,232
I know who you are, Luthor.

61
00:04:10,465 --> 00:04:12,939
And I want nothing to do with you.
Or Cadmus.

62
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:15,008
Cadmus has created
a new super clone.

63
00:04:22,269 --> 00:04:24,778
Guardian!
Fast work on the rebuilt.

64
00:04:24,846 --> 00:04:26,776
Now escort me down
the easy way.

65
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:30,378
<i>Or I escort myself down,
the hard way.</i>

66
00:04:32,955 --> 00:04:34,997
You're letting Superboy down here?

67
00:04:35,272 --> 00:04:37,199
Focus on the matter at hand,
Dr. Spence.

68
00:04:37,394 --> 00:04:39,040
Another genomorph has vanished.

69
00:04:39,051 --> 00:04:41,433
Every disappearance
is being investigated.

70
00:04:41,435 --> 00:04:43,029
Not good enough, Dubbilex.

71
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,816
The new super clone.
Where are you holding it?

72
00:04:47,109 --> 00:04:48,435
Welcome home, Superboy.

73
00:04:48,684 --> 00:04:50,262
Now, what are you talking about?

74
00:04:50,564 --> 00:04:53,566
Brother, you are
the only super clone in Cadmus.

75
00:04:53,608 --> 00:04:55,730
All cloning projects,
human and Kryptonian

76
00:04:55,731 --> 00:04:57,914
had been shut down
since your escape.

77
00:04:58,185 --> 00:04:59,904
"Since my liberation".

78
00:05:00,297 --> 00:05:01,535
As you say.

79
00:05:01,688 --> 00:05:03,398
But now I'm needed
back in my lab.

80
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,407
Sometimes I hate this job.

81
00:05:10,336 --> 00:05:12,559
You... you look a lot
like Red Arrow.

82
00:05:12,766 --> 00:05:15,640
Not all that surprising,
Red Arrow is my nephew.

83
00:05:17,219 --> 00:05:19,954
If we're considering Blue Devil,
then I nominate Red Arrow.

84
00:05:20,078 --> 00:05:22,365
Roy has more experience
and he's no kid anymore.

85
00:05:22,366 --> 00:05:24,577
He's eighteen.
A legal adult.

86
00:05:24,602 --> 00:05:26,902
- He's ready.
- Is he?

87
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:30,173
Red Arrow has been uncooperative
and disrespectful.

88
00:05:30,267 --> 00:05:32,058
If we reward that behavior...

89
00:05:32,126 --> 00:05:34,540
What message does that send
to the rest of the Team?

90
00:05:35,648 --> 00:05:36,892
Here's the floor 1-1.

91
00:05:36,906 --> 00:05:38,712
This is the new and improved Cadmus.

92
00:05:40,318 --> 00:05:41,892
Doctor Spence and her team

93
00:05:41,893 --> 00:05:44,410
are doing truly worthwhile
genetic medical research now.

94
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:47,417
The genomorphs are becoming
more independent. More educated.

95
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,686
Some even have names.

96
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,998
Hey, Benny!

97
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,809
And, someday...

98
00:05:52,848 --> 00:05:55,133
The working done here
will save millions of lives...

99
00:05:55,143 --> 00:05:57,407
<i>Superboy...
You may trust Guardian.</i>

100
00:05:57,671 --> 00:05:59,217
<i>He keeps no secrets.</i>

101
00:05:59,224 --> 00:06:00,435
<i>Unlike you...</i>

102
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:03,163
<i>Apparently, you still keep
your psychic power a secret.</i>

103
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,283
<i>Some secrets have their place.</i>

104
00:06:05,705 --> 00:06:09,303
<i>We were all created
to be exploited as living weapons.</i>

105
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:10,585
<i>You were designed...</i>

106
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:13,762
<i>...to replace or destroy Superman,
I know. What's your point?</i>

107
00:06:13,994 --> 00:06:17,354
<i>That you should understand
the plight of those left behind,</i>

108
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,120
<i>after I helped free you
from Cadmus.</i>

109
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,513
<i>The League liberated all genomorphs.</i>

110
00:06:23,564 --> 00:06:26,752
<i>Are we free to walk the surface,
as you do?</i>

111
00:06:26,862 --> 00:06:31,091
<i>Or has our role merely changed
from weapons to minimum labor?</i>

112
00:06:31,278 --> 00:06:33,474
<i>Look... it's complicated.</i>

113
00:06:33,484 --> 00:06:34,791
<i>But first things first.</i>

114
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,960
Guardian, could a super clone exist
without you knowing?

115
00:06:38,654 --> 00:06:39,926
It's highly unlikely.

116
00:06:39,948 --> 00:06:41,524
<i>Tell me, Brother,</i>

117
00:06:41,525 --> 00:06:44,513
<i>what would you do
if you found this super clone?</i>

118
00:06:44,812 --> 00:06:46,598
If it'd exist, I'd free it.

119
00:06:46,842 --> 00:06:49,417
Just like Aqualad, Robin and Kid Flash
freed me.

120
00:06:49,608 --> 00:06:51,481
<i>Then I will question our brothers.</i>

121
00:06:51,627 --> 00:06:54,775
<i>Nothing happens at Cadmus
without a genomorph knowing.</i>

122
00:06:54,992 --> 00:06:57,805
<i>If a super clone exists,
we will find him.</i>

123
00:06:57,822 --> 00:07:00,254
Look, I have my own
missing genomorphs to locate.

124
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,135
But you got the run of the place.

125
00:07:02,902 --> 00:07:05,388
I just doubt you'll find
what you're looking for.

126
00:08:24,356 --> 00:08:26,940
It's OK.
You're free now.

127
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,043
Stop! I'm on your side!

128
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,456
You can fly...
Why can you fly?

129
00:09:22,191 --> 00:09:23,990
I don't wanna do this!

130
00:09:30,502 --> 00:09:31,761
Enough!

131
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,013
I'm trying to help you!

132
00:10:09,807 --> 00:10:11,020
No!

133
00:10:11,026 --> 00:10:14,236
Red Arrow may be eighteen,
but the rest of the Team is too young.

134
00:10:14,469 --> 00:10:16,867
We're not inducting children
into the League.

135
00:10:17,494 --> 00:10:19,194
That seems ironic.

136
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:22,623
I have been one
with Kid Flash and Aqualad.

137
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,556
Both are ready.

138
00:10:24,855 --> 00:10:27,213
- And what of Zatanna?
- Absolutely not!

139
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,549
That sounded almost protective,
Doctor.

140
00:10:29,812 --> 00:10:32,477
At least we know Zatara
is still in that helmet, somewhere.

141
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,655
Why is Doctor Fate a member?

142
00:10:34,698 --> 00:10:37,047
You coerced Zatara
into giving up his life to you.

143
00:10:37,063 --> 00:10:39,017
Or else,
lose his daughter instead.

144
00:10:39,086 --> 00:10:40,224
Not cool.

145
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:42,988
Should such behavior
be condoned?

146
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,947
Zatara desires
Doctor Fate remain with the League.

147
00:10:47,035 --> 00:10:49,498
- Oh, please...
- It is true!

148
00:10:49,555 --> 00:10:52,997
Zatara's trust in Nabu is...
measured.

149
00:10:53,067 --> 00:10:56,924
He desires the League
to maintain a close watch upon us.

150
00:11:02,743 --> 00:11:04,701
No, no, no!

151
00:11:09,341 --> 00:11:10,660
It's alright!

152
00:11:10,681 --> 00:11:12,402
It's not "alright"!

153
00:11:12,518 --> 00:11:13,823
You put me in a pod!

154
00:11:13,902 --> 00:11:15,860
It was the fastest way
to heal your injuries!

155
00:11:15,903 --> 00:11:19,344
She's another Cadmus' mad scientist,
picking up where Desmond left off!

156
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:21,759
"Project Match" is yours!
Admit it!

157
00:11:22,032 --> 00:11:23,249
Believe what you want!

158
00:11:25,358 --> 00:11:26,707
Superboy, please!

159
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:30,924
She was as shocked to see the security
camera footage of this "Match" as I was.

160
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,699
- Where is he now?
- We don't know.

161
00:11:33,724 --> 00:11:35,101
He... disappeared.

162
00:11:35,102 --> 00:11:36,240
What?

163
00:11:36,344 --> 00:11:38,529
All cameras went offline
after your battle.

164
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:41,162
By the time we arrived...
Match was gone.

165
00:11:41,374 --> 00:11:43,763
And he isn't the only genomorph
to disappear.

166
00:11:44,362 --> 00:11:46,212
We need to go
to the bottom of this.

167
00:11:52,472 --> 00:11:55,148
<i>So, the truth
wasn't that hard to find, after all.</i>

168
00:11:55,284 --> 00:11:56,893
<i>I assume you suffered no...</i>

169
00:11:56,896 --> 00:11:58,911
<i>- ...permanent damage.</i>
- Like you care!

170
00:11:59,162 --> 00:12:01,462
Tell me what you know
about Project Match.

171
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:03,866
<i>Very little.
I know more about you.</i>

172
00:12:04,031 --> 00:12:08,446
Kryptonian DNA is notoriously
difficult for human science to read.

173
00:12:08,582 --> 00:12:09,802
<i>When you were created,</i>

174
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:12,912
<i>the gaps in the sequences were bridged
with human DNA.</i>

175
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:15,500
<i>Robbing you
of your full Kryptonian powers.</i>

176
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,860
<i>No flight, no heat vision,
etcetera.</i>

177
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:19,481
I'm part human!

178
00:12:19,495 --> 00:12:20,796
<i>Yes.</i>

179
00:12:20,798 --> 00:12:24,656
<i>Obviously, your... twin
was created with pure Kryptonian DNA.</i>

180
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:28,163
<i>The missing sequences have...
apparently left Match unstable.</i>

181
00:12:28,173 --> 00:12:29,406
<i>Insane.</i>

182
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:32,409
<i>I'd advise you to get him
back on ice as soon as possible.</i>

183
00:12:32,492 --> 00:12:33,988
Not gonna happen.

184
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,649
<i>Your call.
Either way, you'll need help.</i>

185
00:12:39,157 --> 00:12:40,458
<i>Consider this a gift.</i>

186
00:12:43,218 --> 00:12:44,786
<i>I call them "shields".</i>

187
00:12:44,902 --> 00:12:46,470
Stick one on your arm

188
00:12:46,471 --> 00:12:49,262
and it will suppress your human DNA
for about an hour.

189
00:12:49,323 --> 00:12:51,628
Allowing your Kryptonian powers
to bloom.

190
00:12:51,694 --> 00:12:53,808
<i>You'll be as powerful
as Match.</i>

191
00:12:53,861 --> 00:12:55,225
<i>As Superman.</i>

192
00:12:55,603 --> 00:12:57,313
I don't want anything from you.

193
00:12:57,656 --> 00:12:58,897
<i>Keep them, anyway.</i>

194
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,196
<i>You never know.</i>

195
00:13:05,226 --> 00:13:06,447
Plastic Man.

196
00:13:07,356 --> 00:13:10,664
I don't know... The guy has
a pretty substantial criminal record.

197
00:13:12,849 --> 00:13:14,298
Sorry... sorry.

198
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,043
The guy just cracks me up.

199
00:13:21,109 --> 00:13:23,820
Maybe it's time we all talk
about the elephant in the room.

200
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:25,964
Should Captain Marvel
stay a member?

201
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:28,050
Now that we know
he's really only ten years old?

202
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:31,493
He does possess an adult body
and the wisdom of Solomon.

203
00:13:31,676 --> 00:13:34,221
Wisdom does not equal maturity.

204
00:13:34,656 --> 00:13:36,572
Hey, I'm sitting right here!

205
00:13:36,767 --> 00:13:38,720
Then, Billy, maybe
you should leave.

206
00:13:38,723 --> 00:13:40,207
Until we hash this out.

207
00:13:40,284 --> 00:13:42,185
No. Captain Marvel is a member

208
00:13:42,186 --> 00:13:46,157
and is entitled to participate,
until or unless he's voted out.

209
00:13:46,217 --> 00:13:49,608
It's not just his age.
It's the fact that he lied about it.

210
00:13:49,655 --> 00:13:51,769
I didn't lie...
...exactly.

211
00:13:52,047 --> 00:13:54,313
I just left out the part
about being a kid.

212
00:13:54,595 --> 00:13:56,483
A lie of omission is still a lie.

213
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,586
You kept an important secret from us.

214
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:00,568
No one in the League
knew the truth.

215
00:14:00,577 --> 00:14:01,795
I did.

216
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,904
I shouldn't be surprised.

217
00:14:04,502 --> 00:14:07,784
Since you indoctrinated Robin into crime
fighting at the ripe old age of nine...

218
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:12,074
Robin needed to help bring the man
who murdered his family to justice.

219
00:14:12,121 --> 00:14:13,931
So he could turn out like you?

220
00:14:15,205 --> 00:14:16,621
So that he wouldn't.

221
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:22,727
At least these are empty.

222
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,903
<i>OK, Dubbilex, spit it all.</i>

223
00:14:25,136 --> 00:14:27,903
<i>When I accused Spence,
I could hear your heart rate increase.</i>

224
00:14:28,109 --> 00:14:30,126
<i>Stress.
You're hiding something.</i>

225
00:14:30,349 --> 00:14:32,056
<i>From them, not you.</i>

226
00:14:32,128 --> 00:14:34,180
<i>I have questioned
the oldest genomorphes.</i>

227
00:14:34,229 --> 00:14:36,578
<i>They tell me Match is not
your younger brother.</i>

228
00:14:36,635 --> 00:14:39,329
<i>He was Cadmus' first attempt
to clone Superman.</i>

229
00:14:39,682 --> 00:14:42,627
<i>His Kryptonian DNA
rendered him uncontrollable,</i>

230
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,990
<i>so they froze him,
and struck again.</i>

231
00:14:45,044 --> 00:14:46,378
<i>Who are "they"?</i>

232
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,005
<i>Desmond? Spence?</i>

233
00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:49,508
<i>Desmond, yes.</i>

234
00:14:49,684 --> 00:14:51,918
<i>And his superior
and Cadmus founder,</i>

235
00:14:52,234 --> 00:14:53,469
<i>Lex Luthor.</i>

236
00:14:56,422 --> 00:14:57,987
So Luthor took Match.

237
00:14:58,143 --> 00:14:59,611
<i>Actually, Brother,</i>

238
00:14:59,762 --> 00:15:01,033
<i>I did that.</i>

239
00:15:08,904 --> 00:15:10,232
<i>Turn left, Brother.</i>

240
00:15:42,372 --> 00:15:43,956
Welcome, Brother,

241
00:15:43,957 --> 00:15:45,967
to Genomorph City.

242
00:15:56,649 --> 00:15:59,362
So you're responsible
for the missing genomorphs.

243
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:00,527
I am.

244
00:16:00,547 --> 00:16:02,855
One by one,
I liberated them,

245
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:06,989
brought them here, to a new life,
where all our brothers can be free.

246
00:16:07,045 --> 00:16:11,530
Of course, I have a dream that one day,
the world you live in will accept us.

247
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:15,795
But for now, no one must know
Genomorph City exists.

248
00:16:16,281 --> 00:16:18,591
Which is why
I brought our brother here.

249
00:16:24,678 --> 00:16:27,603
- What have you done to him?
- He is safe.

250
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:31,108
The genoms keep him docile
with their psychic abilities.

251
00:16:31,183 --> 00:16:32,468
And the chains?

252
00:16:32,507 --> 00:16:34,665
Should he escape,
in his current condition,

253
00:16:34,682 --> 00:16:38,128
he could set back
the genomorph cause by decades.

254
00:16:38,378 --> 00:16:41,172
So you hold him prisoner,
like Cadmus held me?

255
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:43,162
You might as well put him in a pod!

256
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:45,806
Our goal is rehabilitation.

257
00:16:46,096 --> 00:16:48,624
We will release him
when he is ready.

258
00:16:48,935 --> 00:16:50,381
That's not your call!

259
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,158
<i>Be calm!</i>

260
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,851
You seem to have reached consensus

261
00:17:39,853 --> 00:17:43,392
that eighteen years is a suitable
minimal age for joining the League.

262
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,000
Yet, what of Miss Martian?

263
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:48,499
Though she is a biological adolescent
by Martian standards,

264
00:17:48,915 --> 00:17:51,887
she was born 48 Earth years ago.

265
00:17:51,968 --> 00:17:54,012
So what is the deciding factor?

266
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,185
Chronology or biology?

267
00:17:56,397 --> 00:17:58,768
- Take Superboy.
- Exactly.

268
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,681
He's less than a year old.

269
00:18:00,762 --> 00:18:03,775
Does he have to wait 17 more
to stand beside us?

270
00:18:19,488 --> 00:18:20,883
My turn.

271
00:19:03,097 --> 00:19:04,619
Superboy, enough!

272
00:19:09,821 --> 00:19:12,081
He's down.
You won.

273
00:19:32,567 --> 00:19:34,188
It has to be this way.

274
00:19:37,881 --> 00:19:39,429
No other ideas?

275
00:19:41,526 --> 00:19:44,608
Then here are candidates
for new, or continued membership.

276
00:19:45,245 --> 00:19:46,732
We've debated origin,

277
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:50,831
gender, size, experience, age,
temperament and background.

278
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,235
But... What is the fundamental
criteria for membership?

279
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:57,186
When all is settling down,
the question must be,

280
00:19:57,607 --> 00:19:59,031
whom do we trust?

281
00:19:59,669 --> 00:20:01,188
Trust to fight beside us,

282
00:20:01,398 --> 00:20:02,970
trust to have our backs,

283
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,493
trust to uphold the high standards
and ideals of the Justice League.

284
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,903
Time to vote.

285
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:14,154
There was a tracker
in that tin box you gave me.

286
00:20:14,242 --> 00:20:17,985
Yes. I assume you discovered it,
with your X-ray vision?

287
00:20:18,443 --> 00:20:19,978
You initiated the cloning projects!

288
00:20:20,155 --> 00:20:22,268
I wanted Superman
to meet his match.

289
00:20:22,449 --> 00:20:25,335
And you used both of us
to locate the missing genomorphs.

290
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:28,312
A good businessman
has to keep track of his assets.

291
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:30,768
But none of that
is what really bothers you.

292
00:20:31,065 --> 00:20:32,519
Half your DNA is human.

293
00:20:32,737 --> 00:20:34,391
Haven't you wondered
who the donor was?

294
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,446
Or have you just been afraid
to acknowledge the obvious...

295
00:20:37,828 --> 00:20:39,037
Face it, son.

296
00:20:39,509 --> 00:20:41,804
You have much more in common
with me than Superman.

297
00:20:41,894 --> 00:20:43,103
That's a lie!

298
00:20:43,207 --> 00:20:45,175
What has he given you?
Nothing.

299
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,125
Not even affection.
And, why?

300
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,133
Because Big-Boy-Blue
lives in a world of black and white.

301
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:53,001
You were created by the "bad guys".

302
00:20:53,081 --> 00:20:54,933
So there must be
something wrong with you.

303
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,753
But we both know
life isn't that clear cut.

304
00:20:57,836 --> 00:20:59,814
The real world is full of grays.

305
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,744
Weren't you determined
to free Match at all cost?

306
00:21:02,753 --> 00:21:06,478
Yet, ultimately, you wisely agreed
to my suggestion to refreeze him,

307
00:21:06,493 --> 00:21:07,780
for the greater good of all.

308
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:11,829
And though you think me a villain,
you still accepted my shields.

309
00:21:12,644 --> 00:21:15,024
We're more alike
than you care to admit.

310
00:21:16,297 --> 00:21:18,193
- Take them back.
- They're a gift!

311
00:21:18,757 --> 00:21:20,591
From a father to his son.

312
00:21:20,954 --> 00:21:23,142
I won't need them for this...

313
00:21:23,648 --> 00:21:24,780
"Red Sun."

314
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:33,301
Two words,
and he shut me down...

315
00:21:33,648 --> 00:21:35,109
What else can he make me do?

316
00:21:48,518 --> 00:21:51,252
All those in favor
of ratifying the results...

317
00:21:51,439 --> 00:21:52,548
I!

318
