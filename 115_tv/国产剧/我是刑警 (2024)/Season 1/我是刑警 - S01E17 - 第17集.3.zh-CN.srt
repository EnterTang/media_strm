1
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,840
Recognized: Batman.  Zero Two.

2
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,720
How are they?

3
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,090
I am still shaken by what you and I wrought.

4
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,470
One can only imagine how these youths fare.

5
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,840
I know our virtual reality training simulation went badly,

6
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,230
but I'd hoped the team would have rallied by now.

7
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,650
Trauma tends to linger, as I know you know, my friend.

8
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,360
Black Canary?

9
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,860
She has her work cut out for her.

10
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,450
I can only imagine how devastating it was.

11
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:07,460
Losing your friends, in essence your family,
convinced all the time it was completely real.

12
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,710
I'm sure it must have been horrible for you.

13
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,920
I understand. You're Superboy.

14
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,340
You're not supposed to have feelings of sadness or vulnerability.

15
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,850
You don't know what I feel!

16
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:20,850
Conner!

17
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,990
Just leave me alone!

18
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,080
When can we see some cowboys?

19
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:50,250
Your obsession with the barbarians must wait, Serifan.

20
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:56,130
Mother Box, please camouflage all extraterrestrial energy signatures and scan the planet, and advise.

21
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,220
What we seek is on world. Let us...

22
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,560
The new Genisphere is on Earth!

23
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,010
Then we shall take her back!

24
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:10,060
The Forever People will not be denied!

25
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,360
And woe to any who stand in our way.

26
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,780
Red Tornado, hangar door.

27
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,080
Sphere, out of the way!

28
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,110
Whoa!

29
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,310
Superboy, return to cave.

30
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,730
<i>-rboy, return to cave.</i>

31
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,400
Look, me dying during the exercise might have started things going south.

32
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,490
But I was coma girl. Missed out on all the fun.

33
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,280
Forgetting it wasn't real, so, no trauma.

34
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,730
No need for the shrink wrap.

35
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,240
You're too tough to need help.

36
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,400
Whatever.  Maybe.

37
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,730
Or maybe too tough to admit you need help.

38
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:49,800
Artemis, it's not a sign of weakness to open up to your friends.

39
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,160
I know that.

40
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,000
But you still keep secrets from them.

41
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,540
And you won't tell them.  You can't!

42
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,260
I won't. But you should.

43
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,530
You could start by admitting you're not really Green Arrow's niece.

44
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,970
Great. Can you imagine what <i>Wally</i> would do with that?

45
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,390
Interesting.

46
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,550
So, the person you're most worried about is Wally.

47
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,980
Let's see what our boy can do.

48
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,360
Oh, yeah!

49
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:27,530
Whoa!

50
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:34,370
Return the new Genisphere, and the rest of the technology you have stolen from New Genesis, human.

51
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,370
Who are you?! What do you...

52
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,290
Let's keep this simple.

53
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:43,090
That belongs to us.  Give.  It.  Back.

54
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,640
Forever People, stand down.

55
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,560
This one did not steal the new Genisphere.  He <i>saved</i> it from the real thieves.

56
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:59,980
Apologies!  The Forever People embrace you as a friend, ally, and worthy warrior.

57
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,650
You're kidding, right?

58
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:08,660
I was the general, but behaved like a soldier and sacrificed myself.

59
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,500
I am not fit for command and must resign as team leader.

60
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,660
Who do you recommend to take your place?

61
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,750
Artemis is too raw and untrusting.

62
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,170
Kid Flash too rash and impulsive.

63
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,170
Miss Martian remains too eager to please.

64
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,630
Superboy carries too much anger.

65
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,890
Making Robin the logical choice.

66
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,680
But he is so young.

67
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,850
Kaldur, you're all young.

68
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,520
I cannot shift this burden to him.

69
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,210
Not yet.

70
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,330
Heh. It appears I must withdraw my resignation.

71
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,320
Forever People?

72
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,200
We're young gods.

73
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,450
New gods.

74
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,620
Right.

75
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,640
They call me Serifan.

76
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,710
I'm Dreamer. This is Moonrider.

77
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:54,870
And our leader Vykin.

78
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:59,750
Hmm. And I am named for an animal that does not exist on this world.

79
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:02,960
But you may call me... Wolf.

80
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,510
This is Wolf.

81
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:09,340
Ah. Bear, then. Yeah, Bear is even better.

82
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:12,220
I'm  Con-... Superboy.

83
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:15,040
This is Mother Box, the living computer.

84
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,520
She has tracked technology stolen from our home world, New Genesis.

85
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,840
And she has found our rescue drill... there.

86
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:32,520
It is beneath us... 18 meters underground.

87
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,950
That's a construction site. Perfect cover for drilling.

88
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:41,080
Especially with the Federal Reserve
conveniently located across the street.

89
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,250
The government keeps money there?

90
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,300
It's a heist.

91
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,800
Come on, pardners, let's ride in there guns a-blazin' and round up them outlaws.

92
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,680
He's watched a lot of Earth Westerns.

93
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,060
Yeah, well, there's a time to go in strong and a time to go in smart.

94
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,900
It is your world, Superboy. We shall follow your lead.

95
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:08,600
Norman!  I brought you a jacket.

96
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,450
Mom?! What are you doing here?

97
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:16,350
Mom, get down! It's not... safe.

98
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,700
A billion in bullion, Ugly.

99
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,360
The old creep's gear performed as advertised.

100
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,650
Yeah, Whisper, gave me a score tops any my old man ever delivered to Intergang.

101
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,870
Wait!

102
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,410
Guess we decided on the direct approach after all.

103
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:08,480
That drill and these carts are the property of New Genesis. You <i>will</i> return them now.

104
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,550
Gold goes back too.

105
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,260
Interfere, and things get ugly.

106
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,740
I'm Ugly.

107
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,630
These weapons aren't from New Genesis.

108
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,580
They are of... the enemy.

109
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:53,590
What enemy?
They are of... the enemy.

110
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,180
What enemy?

111
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,780
<i>The </i>enemy.

112
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,760
The gods of anti-life.

113
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,310
These weapons are of Apokolips.

114
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,460
So, you want me to believe that after everything you went through,

115
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:35,000
including your own death from fiery explosion, you're peachy?

116
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:39,350
I'm, uh, fairly certain I never used the word peachy.

117
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,270
But, I think you got the gist.

118
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,320
So you really have no interest in confronting your extreme reaction to Artemis' death?

119
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,820
I'd rather talk about you, babe.

120
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,610
Wally, you're in denial.

121
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,240
I'm comfortable with that.

122
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,330
The confines of this tunnel favor their weapons.

123
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,710
Let's bring this battle into the open.

124
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,460
More room at the top!

125
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:17,570
They're getting away!

126
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:24,470
Move!

127
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,570
I have no wish to prolong this battle.

128
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:40,950
Finish him.

129
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,390
Fear not. She will protect us.

130
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,380
Who, Dreamer?

131
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,810
The new Genisphere.

132
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,080
Cool.

133
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,980
Wait. Sphere's a she?

134
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,100
It is time.

135
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:54,960
Time for what?

136
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,300
All: Taruu!

137
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,310
Okay. That's... new.

138
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,390
Ugly, wait!

139
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,140
Wait!

140
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,610
What... was <i>that</i>?

141
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,360
Infinity-Man.

142
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,370
We merged to become part of the Source, and greater than the sum of our parts.

143
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:08,490
Glad my team's not that close.

144
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,710
Lower beings tend to fear intimacy.

145
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,790
None of this makes any sense.

146
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,050
How are these humans acquiring technology from both New Genesis and Apokolips?

147
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,760
I'm not talking.

148
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,540
You were not asked.

149
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,110
Desaad.

150
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:44,860
Look, I've been remarkably patient.  You know, for me?

151
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,240
What is going on?

152
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,040
The New gods come from two worlds at war.

153
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,420
Those of us from New Genesis are
gods of life, freedom, and the Source.

154
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:01,760
Our enemies from Apokolips are
gods of anti-life, slavery, and degradation.

155
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,020
This is Desaad, god-scientist and chief torturer of Apokolips.

156
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:11,020
His experiments are pure evil; his works, abominations.

157
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,250
His master...

158
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,850
Unspeakable.

159
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,720
He is seriously creepy.

160
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,260
Hurting? Try traumatized.

161
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:30,870
I finally become leader, and wind up
sending all of my friends to their deaths.

162
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,540
I-I know I did what I had to.

163
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,790
But I hated it.

164
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:39,290
When we started this team, I was desperate to be in charge. Not anymore.

165
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,920
A-And that's not even the worst of it.

166
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,550
You can't tell Batman.

167
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,470
Nothing leaves this room.

168
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:52,480
I always wanted, expected... t-to grow up a-a nd become him.

169
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,890
A-And the hero bit?  I'm still all in.

170
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,400
But that thing inside of him?

171
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:03,400
The thing t-that drives him to sacrifice <i>everything</i> for the sake of his mission.

172
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:10,270
That's not me. I-I don't want to be <i>the</i> Batman anymore.

173
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:20,410
Mother Box says there's a large cache of Apokoliptian technology inside.

174
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:28,720
Infrared vision shows no heat signatures.

175
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,880
Even so...

176
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,230
Still no heat signatures.

177
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,140
The place is definitely deserted.

178
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,030
Though I could be wrong.

179
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:50,990
This tech masks heat signatures. Visor filters out illusions.

180
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,410
We got ya.

181
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:12,090
These weapons resist my magnetic power. We'll soon be overrun.

182
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:13,680
It is time.

183
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,040
This won't take long!

184
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,350
Go!

185
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:23,900
All: Taruu!

186
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,720
Now, mortal.  Deliver the Father Box.

187
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,710
That can't be good.

188
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,970
Kill the boy... and his little dog too.

189
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,000
Wait!

190
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,800
Good... uh, girl,

191
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,980
We'll take him down together.

192
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,710
Yeah, can't really blame you.

193
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,630
It was all my fault.

194
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,790
Hello, Megan.

195
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:35,390
Who else could take a simple exercise and turn it into a nightmare

196
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,890
that terrorizes everyone she cares about?

197
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,230
You've turned white.

198
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,560
No!

199
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,330
Oh. You meant Caucasian.

200
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,490
Yeah, I'm fine with being Megan.

201
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:53,570
But I can't be trusted to use my other powers.

202
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,820
M'gann, you're a Martian.

203
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,580
Not using your natural abilities is like me refusing to speak.

204
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,260
Which, by the way, I tried for a while.

205
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:06,670
After my very first canary cry nearly deafened my entire first-grade class.

206
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,430
So I get how you feel.

207
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:13,340
But not being yourself is never the answer and won't make your feelings of guilt go away.

208
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:17,760
Learn from what happened. Your uncle would be happy to train you.

209
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:22,930
Practice until you gain control and regain your confidence.

210
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,880
Infinity-Man is now my...

211
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,250
... My master's weapon.

212
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,040
Why doesn't he get it over with?

213
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,600
I am not one for getting it over with.

214
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:16,400
Father Box knows my... proclivities,
and programmed Infinity-Man accordingly.

215
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,900
Attack! Attack while you still can!

216
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,920
Sphere, you're beautiful!

217
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,830
Open fire! All weapons!

218
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:57,530
Our turn.

219
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,640
Think I'm getting the hang of this.

220
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:08,470
Pull!

221
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,630
Now, <i>that's</i> ugly.

222
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,070
Desaad!

223
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,660
All will suffer.

224
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:40,200
All will suffer!

225
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,960
She's... hurt!

226
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,470
The damage may be beyond repair, but Mother Box will try.

227
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:17,610
The healing process has begun and will be completed on New Genesis.

228
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,690
Sorry, what?

229
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:24,360
We thank you for your help, Superboy, but we must take the new Genisphere home now.

230
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,950
No. No way!

231
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,760
Why should we leave her with you?

232
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,570
To us, she lives.

233
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:31,620
To you, she's merely technology.

234
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,050
No, it's not like that.

235
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34,250
Then what is it like?

236
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,750
We bonded, ok?

237
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,020
In fact, it is.

238
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:43,970
You may keep her.

239
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,640
What exactly do you expect to find, Batman?

240
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,150
According to Conner, Sphere has proven quite useful.

241
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,360
Wally has already rechristened her the "SuperCycle."

242
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,630
By any name, the Sphere merits further investigation.

243
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:04,130
As does everything in Superboy's report.

244
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,970
Speaking of, where is he now?

245
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,670
Here's the ugly truth. I wasn't devastated.

246
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,750
Even with Superman, Tornado, you, the whole League dead.

247
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,150
Even though I didn't save Wolf.

248
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:21,090
Watched Artemis and Kaldur die, and abandoned M'gann...

249
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:24,760
I felt... at peace.

250
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:30,370
See, from the moment I first opened my eyes in that Cadmus pod, 

251
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:33,020
there's been one thing I've wanted and feared.

252
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,400
To know what it is to be Superman.

253
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,350
And I know.

254
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:42,070
So I was... happy.

255
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:47,300
Everyone I care about dead or traumatized, and I'm happy.

256
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,910
How do I get past the guilt of that?

257
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,930
How do I live with myself?

258
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,710
I don't have any easy answers, Conner.

259
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:03,210
But one thing's clear. Admitting it is the first step.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
