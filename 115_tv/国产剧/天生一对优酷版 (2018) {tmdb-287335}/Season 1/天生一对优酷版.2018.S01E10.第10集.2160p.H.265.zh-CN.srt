1
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:15,048
five thanks for watching the January

2
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:17,839
10th edition of CNN 10 my name is Carl

3
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:19,939
azuz we're explaining news happening

4
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:21,710
around the world starting with the

5
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,989
evacuations of thousands of people in

6
00:00:23,989 --> 00:00:26,449
Southern California huge parts of this

7
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:28,429
region have been scorched by wildfires

8
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:30,618
over the past year and a half and that's

9
00:00:30,618 --> 00:00:32,418
partly responsible for the latest

10
00:00:32,418 --> 00:00:34,128
disaster people there are facing

11
00:00:34,128 --> 00:00:36,859
mudslides heavy rains have been falling

12
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:38,659
in places like Ventura and Santa Barbara

13
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:41,268
counties and because the fires burned

14
00:00:41,268 --> 00:00:43,698
away so much vegetation in the area

15
00:00:43,698 --> 00:00:46,039
there are fewer trees and bushes to help

16
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:49,128
prevent floods so mud tree limbs and

17
00:00:49,128 --> 00:00:51,859
garbage are flowing like rivers sweeping

18
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:53,899
across busy roads and they've wiped

19
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:56,780
several homes off their foundations this

20
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,878
area is no stranger to mudslides an

21
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:00,079
official from the National Weather

22
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,969
Service says they can be caused by a

23
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:05,299
rainfall rate of a half inch per hour on

24
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:07,159
Tuesday some parts of Southern

25
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:09,349
California got more than three times

26
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:11,450
that in an hour that's led authorities

27
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,060
to give evacuation warnings or orders to

28
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,310
tens of thousands of people one of the

29
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,049
alerts from officials in Santa Barbara

30
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:20,840
County said simply leave debris flow

31
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,228
areas now go to high ground a resident

32
00:01:24,228 --> 00:01:26,390
named Benjamin Hyatt who sent CNN these

33
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,670
pictures said that two to three feet of

34
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,129
mud surrounded his house in an instant

35
00:01:31,129 --> 00:01:33,618
like a dam breaking officials say at

36
00:01:33,618 --> 00:01:35,209
least five people have been killed in

37
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:37,549
these storms and last night more rain

38
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:41,078
was expected worsening fears of flooding

39
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:43,879
in the u.s. flash floods kill more

40
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:46,640
people than tornadoes hurricanes or

41
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,938
lightning a flash flood creates a rush

42
00:01:49,938 --> 00:01:52,218
of moving water that can sweep a grown

43
00:01:52,218 --> 00:01:54,799
man off his feet in a car off the road

44
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,259
and even your entire home off its

45
00:01:57,259 --> 00:02:00,078
foundation when the ground becomes so

46
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,509
saturated that water can no longer seep

47
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:05,060
into the soil it begins to run off

48
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,728
quickly into rivers and streams and this

49
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:11,139
causes a rise in water in a flash

50
00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:13,490
densely populated areas have an

51
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,710
extremely high risk of flash flooding

52
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,539
with the additional concrete unless

53
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:20,150
grassy areas for the water to soak into

54
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,740
the soil in they can

55
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,710
see flash flooding very quickly the

56
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,750
mountainous terrain the combination of

57
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,360
gravity plus the easy runoff can lead to

58
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,879
catastrophic flooding when all of that

59
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:34,490
water is funneled into rivers creeks and

60
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:37,310
even the valleys remember flash flooding

61
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,530
can happen in the blink of an eye that's

62
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,870
why it's important to stay alert and pay

63
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,479
attention in case a flash flood watch or

64
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:49,729
warning is issued for your area which of

65
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:51,710
these scales was named for a Swedish

66
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,080
astronomer who lived in the 1700s

69
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:06,870
was invented by Anders Celsius in 1742

[Music]

71
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:12,080
while parts of the US East Coast

72
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,599
recently endured record-breaking cold

73
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,849
thanks to the bomb cyclone we told you

74
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:17,629
about last week

75
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:19,939
Sydney Australia the nation's most

76
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:22,879
populated city recently sweltered under

00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:27,770
point three degrees Celsius which

79
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:30,319
converts to more than 117 degrees

80
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,599
Fahrenheit it led to warnings about

81
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,639
everything from dehydration and sun

82
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,860
exposure to dangers about potential

83
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,169
fires it's not quite a record in the

84
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:41,900
Australian City that was set in 1939

85
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,849
when temperatures were about one degree

86
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:46,460
higher but when they dropped on Monday

87
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,759
to what was called a colder 33 degrees

88
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:52,430
Celsius or 91 degrees Fahrenheit that

89
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,460
was characterized as a relief so far

90
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,409
today we've discussed fires floods

91
00:03:57,409 --> 00:04:00,080
mudslides and blasts of cold and hot

92
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,590
weather

93
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,300
these things are usually taken into

94
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,340
account when people build new homes or

95
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,530
developers planned communities there's a

96
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,780
tremendous list of options for building

97
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,060
materials wood and steel types of

98
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,250
flooring and climate control levels of

99
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,199
insulation and there are pros and cons

100
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,459
to everything

101
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:19,129
next we're featuring some materials that

102
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:22,660
could surround us in homes of the future

103
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,089
our homes of the future may not look

104
00:04:25,089 --> 00:04:27,220
different but how they're built may be

105
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,100
completely new building materials are

106
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:30,970
getting a makeover

107
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,160
and companies are rethinking how homes

108
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,680
are designed so right now we are

109
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,540
essentially in the penthouse why isn't

110
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,180
this a fancy apartment for bio Mason

111
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,790
innovation means redesigning one of

112
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,120
constructions most popular materials

113
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,250
you're actually trying to then grow the

114
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,470
cement right that's right how do you

115
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,319
actually do that we take bacteria and we

116
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:56,560
put it in our aggregate and grows around

117
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,660
each grain of aggregate as submit'

118
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,240
components it literally is just using

119
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,250
the same organisms that are already

120
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,410
doing things similar in the end of our

121
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,170
universe exactly building the homes of

122
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,000
the future may mean planning for

123
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,699
catastrophes hurricane sandy devastated

124
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:17,259
New York in 2012 a few weeks later JDS

125
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:18,610
development started planning their

126
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,740
newest high-rise when we started

127
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,029
designing this building right after

128
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:24,589
Hurricane

129
00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:28,040
we're working with 50 or 60 people that

130
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,370
had all just lived as we went around the

131
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,350
room and we said what happened to you

132
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,269
they designed flood proofing measures

133
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:37,610
below the building and installed a fleet

134
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:40,220
of generators where the penthouse would

135
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,500
be but most buildings at least in

136
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,720
Manhattan don't do this no nobody does

137
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,550
this the notion that you can't beat you

138
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,259
for that you shouldn't be person safer

139
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:51,079
in your building then outside it's a

140
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:53,300
relatively new concept natural gas power

141
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,040
generators means that residents will

142
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,500
have power even if the rest of Manhattan

143
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,139
is in the dark in the future smart tech

144
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:02,959
won't be limited to inside your home how

145
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:05,750
our building is changing even if you

146
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:10,550
can't see it so those are some possible

147
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,740
future materials what about the stuff

148
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,389
that'll go into future homes

149
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:17,089
specifically the technology that's what

150
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:19,399
CES is all about the Consumer

151
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,478
Electronics Show

152
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:22,250
it's an annual trade show where

153
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,290
technological innovations play the

154
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,418
starring role it's been going on for

155
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:28,579
more than half a century and this year's

156
00:06:28,579 --> 00:06:30,918
event is being held in Las Vegas Nevada

157
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:33,470
we're almost 4,000 companies are

158
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:36,490
exhibiting their work for the more than

159
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:39,949
170,000 people in attendance not all of

160
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:42,199
the ideas presented here take off but

161
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,939
they do give us an idea of where

162
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:46,668
manufacturers think technology is headed

163
00:06:46,668 --> 00:06:49,069
the top trends that we're seeing out

164
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:51,079
here this year number one voice

165
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:53,360
assistance whether it's Amazon's Alexa

166
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,910
or Google's voice assistant it seems

167
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,100
like every piece of technology here

168
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,709
wants to integrate so that they can just

169
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:03,019
have you speaking to control their

170
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:05,899
devices also cities planning for a

171
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:08,360
future with fewer drivers that doesn't

172
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,850
just mean driverless cars it means that

173
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,860
cities are looking for ways so the

174
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,300
stoplights can know that there's an

175
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,160
accident right there communicate to

176
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,470
yourself driving uber car that there's

177
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,788
an accident there and that they need to

178
00:07:19,788 --> 00:07:21,500
go a different direction so a big

179
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,228
ecosystem for the cars and cities to

180
00:07:24,228 --> 00:07:26,899
function together and plus sports tech

181
00:07:26,899 --> 00:07:28,879
going pro what does that mean exactly

182
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:31,279
well we've seen a lot of wearables come

183
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:33,168
and go but now a lot of companies are

184
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:35,120
looking to get very specific not just

185
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,918
the macro market but a lot of times

186
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:38,180
micro markets just

187
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,490
for athletes just for the elderly now

188
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,038
every year at CES there's so much about

189
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:45,110
television some years they lead us

190
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,899
astray 3d televisions remember that well

191
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:49,399
when was the last time you saw somebody

192
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:51,470
with 3d glasses

193
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,120
then there were curved televisions but

194
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,319
who needs that when you have a

195
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,660
television that you can roll up like a

196
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,250
yoga mat though I don't think you'll be

197
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,668
taking this one to yoga class LG Display

198
00:08:01,668 --> 00:08:04,009
has this prototype and it is just a

199
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:07,160
prototype so no price tag right now they

200
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,600
just make screens they're hoping that

201
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,538
one day the actual TV set manufacturers

202
00:08:11,538 --> 00:08:13,970
might integrate this technology so you

203
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,889
can have a TV that can just roll up and

204
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:17,329
disappear out of the way in your house

205
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:19,038
but it doesn't ever really disappear

206
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:20,779
since there's that box right there where

207
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:23,120
it sits LG thinks that maybe you want to

208
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,470
see your television at different heights

209
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,689
so you can see what music is playing or

210
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:28,490
the weather at that smaller height then

211
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,978
maybe it goes up but not so tall so you

212
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:33,379
have a wider format like we're used to

213
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:36,049
in movie theaters or maybe just going

214
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:38,479
all the way up and using your television

215
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,918
the way we're all accustomed to using it

216
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:42,950
now 16 by 9 just to watch TV shows

217
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:50,929
imagine that cheesesteaks can help

218
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:53,450
people grow in a number of ways they can

219
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,490
also serve as an entertaining measuring

220
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,919
tool a father in Philadelphia once

221
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:00,019
noticed that his dinner was about the

222
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:02,480
same length as his infant son so he

223
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,580
started tracking his baby's growth in

224
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,589
relation to the length of a cheese steak

225
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:09,139
this has gone on for two years and the

226
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:11,839
boy has significantly outgrown both the

227
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,089
size of the steaks and having his

228
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:16,610
picture taken with them after all his

229
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,679
name is Lucas not hoagie and maybe he's

230
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:20,240
getting tired of being sandwiched

231
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,700
between the camera and mealtime or jokes

232
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,620
about where's the beef maybe he's a

233
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,208
budding vegetarian or maybe he just

234
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,639
thinks this whole idea is cheesy even

235
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,320
though it's clearly not a missed steak

236
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,330
