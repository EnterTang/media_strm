我刚打完网拍墙球 很饿
I get famished after racquetball.

137
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,820
真锻炼身体
It's a great workout.

138
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,940
告诉你 比网球可刺激多了
A lot more exciting than
tennis,too,I'll tell you.

139
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,780
你打球吗?
You play?

140
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,860
保龄球
Bowling was my game.

141
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,500
是吗
Oh,yeah,yeah.

142
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,500
曾经在俱乐部比赛打出900分
Once hit a 900 series in league play.

143
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,580
自从眼睛不好之后 就没再打过了
But you know,i haven't been
out since my eyes started to go.

144
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,180
现在 我连一个二击全倒都打不到
These days,I couldn't even
pick up a two-pin spare.

145
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,740
没错
Exactly. Exactly.

146
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,340
很遗憾 我能为你做点什么?
So,sorry about that.
What can I do for you?

147
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,420
- 我想跟你开门见山 Frobisher先生
- 请讲
I'm going to be direct with
you,mr.Frobisher. Please.

148
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,980
我们有协议
We had a deal.

149
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:15,980
我知道
I know that.

150
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,740
我让雇员们投票同意你的和解方案
I got the employees to vote
for your settlement offer.

151
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,380
我努力让他们把Hewes女士解雇了
你让我做的我都做了
I tried to get 'em to fire mrs.
Hewes,I did everything you asked me to.

152
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,580
是的
Yes,you did.

153
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,820
你说过会给我好处
You said I'd be taken care of.

154
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,540
判决之后 会给你的
And after the trial,you will be.

155
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,380
那起码要一年 我等不了那么久
That could be a year from
now. I can't wait that long.

156
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,780
Larry 这个事情当初我说得很清楚
Larry,I was very clear about that.

157
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:38,220
你说要给我双倍报酬
You said you were going
to double our arrangement.

158
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,260
好吧 告诉你
All right,yeah,tell you what I'll do.

159
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,900
我会给手下打电话 好吗?
I'm gonna call my people,all right?

160
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,100
看看能不能帮你做点什么
We'll see if we can get
something set up for you here.

161
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,220
我交代的事 要同时进行 好吗?
In the meantime,keep doing
what you're doing,all right?

162
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,020
我们会熬过去...一起度过
We're gonna get through
this... together.

163
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,100
Ellen...他们来了
Ellen... they're here.

164
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,180
谁?
Who is?

165
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,900
你父母
Your parents.

166
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,780
- 她带了什么?
- 松饼
- What did she bring?
- Muffins.

167
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,420
我想是带给你的
I think they're for you.

168
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,500
亲爱的!
Honey!

169
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,340
我早就料到办公室很漂亮
但是 这好家伙!
I assumed the office was nice,but geez!

170
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,180
爸
Hi,dad. Hey.

171
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,460
我助理给你们打电话说
我不能去吃午饭了吗?
My assistant called,right,told
you I couldn't make lunch?

172
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,500
说了 我有些吃惊
不是你亲自打的
Yeah,I was a little surprised
you didn't call us yourself.

173
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,300
- 我们说好的
- 我知道
- We had a plan.
- I know.

174
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,260
- 我们这周晚点再约 我保证
- 好吧
- Let me make it up to you later
this week,I-I promise. - Yeah.

175
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,780
Ellen 我们得谈谈
Uh,ellen,we have to talk.

176
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,500
怎么了?
What's wrong?

177
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,460
我们出交通事故了
Uh... we were in a car accident.

178
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,860
天哪...你们没事吧?
Oh,my G... are you okay?

179
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,700
一个月之前的事了 我们没事
It was a month ago. We're fine.

180
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,380
撞了一个横穿马路的保安
But,uh,I hit a crossing guard.

181
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,460
在学校外面
Outside a school.

182
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,900
他受伤了吗?
Oh... um... was he hurt?

183
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,420
她 叫Linda Reynolds
She. Linda reynolds.

184
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,340
Linda的臀部受伤了
Linda broke her hip.

185
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,140
她在哈德森综合医院做了手术
She had surgery at hudson general.

186
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,300
- 什么时候?
- 两周前
When? Two weeks ago.

187
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,620
他不让我给你电话
Uh... he wouldn't let me call you.

188
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,300
你很忙 我不想你担心
You're busy. I-I didn't
want you to worry.

189
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,460
我们有保险
We have insurance.

190
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,340
我和公司的律师见过面
I,uh... I met with the
lawyer from the company.

191
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,380
然后?
And?

192
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,540
他们真是群混蛋
These guys are sleazeballs.

193
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,220
那女保安在医院呢
但他们考虑的只是赔钱的额度
Lady's in the hospital,all
they care about is bottom line.

194
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,740
爸 律师怎么说?
Dad,what did the lawyer say?

195
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,860
我们会处理好的
I've got it under control.

196
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,460
我明天下午上庭
My deposition is tomorrow afternoon.

197
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,860
明天?
Tomorrow?

198
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,180
我跟他说过
I told him.

199
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,420
你女儿是个出色的律师...
跟她谈谈
Your daughter's a successful
attorney-- talk to her.

200
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,140
会搞定的 Denise
It's under control,denise.

201
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,900
好吧 告诉我怎么回事
Okay,just tell me what happened.

202
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,740
我们去你姐姐家 我取笑你姐夫
We were headed to your sister's,I
made a crack about your brother-in-law,

203
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,060
你妈很生气
and your mother got angry.

204
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,580
这和那事儿有什么关系?
What does that have to do with it?

205
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,540
撞到保安的时候 我们正在吵架
We were arguing when i hit the guard.

206
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,500
那是我的错?
So it's my fault?

207
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,060
- 不 我是说我们正在吵架...
- Ellen?
- No,I'm just saying we were fighting...
- Ellen?

208
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,420
也许因为这个...
...And maybe that's why I...

209
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,420
Patty找你
Um,patty wants to see you.

210
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:46,140
这事儿我还得跟你们聊聊
等一会 好吗?
I want to talk about this
more,so just-just wait here,okay?

211
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,700
我们得去医院
We have to go to the hospital.

212
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,540
干吗?
What for?

213
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,820
去看望她
To say hello.

214
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,260
我告诉Linda我们会顺路看她
I told linda we'd stop by.

215
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,180
- 你妈做了松饼
- 不
- Your mother made muffins.
- No.No,no.

216
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,500
别给她任何东西
You don't give her anything.

217
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,660
我回来给你解释
I'll explain when I get back.

218
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,460
拜托 就在我办公室等我
Please,just wait in my office.

219
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,860
我的天!
Aw,for crying out loud.

220
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:10,580
Hewes女士
我真不知道怎样才能赢官司
You know... I just don't understand
how we could win at trial,mrs.Hewes,

221
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,540
除非你有什么对我们隐瞒
unless you got something
you're not telling us.

222
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:18,420
真相是 我们可能都闹不上法庭
The truth is,we may never get to trial.

223
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,460
那你搞什么?
Then what the hell are you doing?

224
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:25,940
Larry 我没法想像这些天
你承受多大压力
Larry,I can't imagine the pressure
you must be under these days.

225
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,380
不 你理解不了
No. You can'T.

226
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,660
你为Frobisher先生工作多久了?
How many years did you
work for mr.Frobisher?

227
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,060
打从你女儿Glory出生
你就为他工作了34年

228
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,540
没错
That's right.

229
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,700
结果却落得这个下场
And nothing to show for it.

230
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:42,300
像这样的诉讼案
我们每采取一项行动都是有目的的
In a litigation like this,every
move we make has a purpose.

231
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:46,260
要求开庭也是我们获得
更好和解条件的手段
Pushing for a trial is also how
we get a higher settlement offer.

232
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,820
那你愿意和解
So you'd be willing to settle.

233
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,860
我不想
Well,I-I don't want to.

234
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:53,500
但如果Frobisher的人给出公平条件
But if frobisher's people
came up with a fair offer,

235
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,260
我得建议你们认真考虑一下
I'd have to advise you all
to seriously consider it.

236
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,340
怎么个公平法?
What's fair?

237
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:03,660
既然找不到Gregory Malina
我想拿到...
After losing gregory
malina,I'd like to go in at...

238
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,380
3.5到4亿
$350,$400 million.

239
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:10,220
要谈判 但在这点上
But it's a negotiation,and
at this point,

240
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:15,420
我们有可能只能拿到1.75亿
we might have to
accept as little as 175.

241
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,020
1.75亿?
175?

242
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,660
那只是最坏打算
Only as a last resort.

243
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,820
有道理
Makes sense.

244
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:30,140
Larry 我需要你支持我们的工作
In the meantime,larry,I need you
to be supportive of our efforts.

245
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,380
Patty愿意和解?
Patty's willing to settle now.

246
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,420
我觉得不会
I doubt it.

247
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,420
Popler老煽动客户代表摇摆不定
Popler has got a lot of
sway with the client reps.

248
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,340
我想她只是要拉拢他
I'm sure she's just
trying to get him on board.

249
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,220
你没解雇他?
You didn't fire him yet?

250
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,940
为什么要炒他?
Why would I do that?

251
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,140
Patty想让你这么做
Well,patty wants you to.

252
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,060
她没说
She didn't say that.

253
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,860
她说她不喜欢他
She said she didn't like him.

254
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,300
那表示...?
And that means...?

255
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,580
开了他
Get rid of him.

256
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,700
证券交易的文件?
Sec files?

257
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,260
对
Yes.Yep.

258
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,500
这里
This is... it.

259
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,140
1998之后的文件都拿来了?
You brought me everything from 1998?

260
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,900
1998?
1998?

261
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,420
我需要从证券交易调查初始
到现在的所有文件
Yeah,I need everything from the
beginning of the sec investigation.

262
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,540
不只是庭审相关的
Not just the trial.

263
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,900
对不起
Sorry.

264
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,220
我父母去哪里了?
Where did my parents go?

265
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:17,780
你爸说起医院里的女人 所以...
Your dad said something about
a woman in the hospital,so...

266
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,700
Parsons! 过来
Parsons!Let's go.

267
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,980
你律师来了
Your attorney's here.

268
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:36,100
转身 面对墙 把手放背后
Turn around and face the wall.
Put your hands behind your back.

269
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,220
然后你就可以进行申辩
And then you'll enter your plea.

270
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,420
联系我父母了吗?
Did you contact my parents?

271
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,740
他们在赶过来
They're on their way.

272
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,940
Patty呢?
And patty?

273
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,820
我们找不到她
We can't find her.

274
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:50,060
不过我们还在跟踪Tom Shayes
But we're still watching tom shayes.

275
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,140
Ellen Parsons
Ellen parsons.

276
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,840
6% 坡度 快果岭
高球洞右侧推杆
Six-percent grade,fast
greens,breaks to the left.

277
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,320
要全神贯注
It's all about focus and concentration.

278
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,120
我也希望这案子 能跟你打高尔夫一样
用短杆策略快速搞定
As much as I wish this case could
be decided by your short game,

279
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,440
我还是为你准备了上庭的资料
we've got a deposition
to prepare you for.

280
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,960
我看过了你在政府审讯时的证词
I've gone through your transcripts
from the government trial,

281
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:31,680
有些地方...我觉得可以做得更好
and there are a couple of areas...
I feel we can handle better.

282
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,880
你觉得我说得太多?
You think I gave away too much?

283
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:38,640
我想介绍个专家
负责帮你准备上庭作证的事
I'd like to bring in a specialist,help
prepare you for the deposition.

284
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,800
Patty Hewes现在就专注这一个案子
要把你扳倒
Patty hewes's whole case
now is about tripping you up.

285
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,560
去做吧
Let's do it.

286
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,560
弄个强悍点的
找个最强硬的律师
Get us a barracuda. Get us the toughest
son-of-a-btich attorney you can find.

287
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,920
不过告诉你 Ray
But I'm telling you something,ray.

288
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,000
她怕了 哥们
She's scared,man.

289
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,040
她已经没信心了
She's losing her confidence.

290
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,680
你怎么这么想?
What makes you think so?

291
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,440
我有可靠消息透露她想和解
I have it on good authority
that she's willing to settle.

292
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,800
所谓的可靠消息是谁说的?
Whose authority?

293
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,880
只要花1.75亿
$175 million is what it would cost.

294
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,560
几个星期前
这女人还团结一心要开庭 对吗?
A few weeks ago,this woman
was,like,gung ho for a trial,right?

295
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,760
她怕了 哥们
She's scared,man.

296
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,360
你说 可靠消息 什么意思?
What do you mean,on good authority?

297
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,480
不 别担心 只是...
No,don't worry about it.It's just...

298
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,800
天哪 不
Jesus,no.

299
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,680
什么?
What?

300
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,200
Art? Art?
Art? Art?

301
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,760
别告诉我 你和内部的人有联系
Don't tell me you've been
talking to someone on the inside.

302
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,160
听着 他 呃...他人不错 Ray
Look,he's A... he's a good guy,ray.

303
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,560
是个直性子
He's a straight shooter.

304
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,320
你知道的 其实我们该感激他
You know something,we should
be showing him some gratitude.

305
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,680
真的 我希望你
嗯...给他建个账户
Seriously,I want you to,you know,get
him set up with some account,you know?

306
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,120
海外账户或什么的
Uh,offshore,however we do that.

307
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,920
绝对不行
Absolutely not!

308
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,160
有谁知道这事?
Who knows about this?

309
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,320
没人
No one.

310
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,760
你没给他钱吧?
You haven't paid him anything,have you?

311
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,520
我向他保证过我会的 Ray
I gave him my word,ray.

312
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,840
好吧 不管任何情况 我告诉你...
All right,in no uncertain
terms,I am telling you...

313
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,520
别再跟他接触
to shut this down!

314
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:05,880
无论在何种情况下
永远不许再跟他联系
Never again are you to have contact
with this man,under any circumstances!

315
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:11,240
Authur 你可能会因此进监狱的
Arthur... you can go to jail for this.

316
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,400
明白吗?
You understand?

317
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,400
别再联系了
No more.

318
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,760
好吧
All right.

319
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,320
我知道了
I understand.

320
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,360
1.75亿?
175?

321
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,760
噢 真是幅美丽的画卷
Well,isn't this a swell picture.

322
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,920
什么事 Ray
What,ray?

323
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,200
你的小宝贝不拉屎吗
Your little precious never takes a shit?

324
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,760
真希望在你心情好点的时候碰到你
I wish i caught you in a better mood.

325
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,400
我没事
I'm fine.

326
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:01,080
或许你能收敛下脾气
私下听我说两句
Well,then perhaps you'd care to
humor me for a moment,off the record.

327
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,600
洗耳恭听
I'm listening.

328
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,120
请理解 我没被授权
Understand,I'm not authorized.

329
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,320
不能做任何保证
I'm making no promises.

330
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,400
我不会要你保证什么
I'm not taking any.

331
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,840
我的委托人撤回了1亿赔偿和解
My client pulled his
offer of a hundred million.

332
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,240
如果我让他重新考虑 增加价码
你说怎么样?
What if I could get him to
reconsider,maybe even sweeten the pot a bit?

333
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,760
他有什么必要那么做
Why would he do that?

334
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,720
-我们来算算这笔数 Patty
-好的
- Let's you and I do the math here,patty.
- 'Kay.

335
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,640
你那边的情况是
All right,here's what you've got.

336
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:31,520
有个亿万富翁 不论事实与否
人们都认为他贪污
A billionaire who the public already
believes is corrupt,whether he is or isn'T.

337
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,800
他根本就是
He is.

338
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,760
我这边的情况是
And here's what I got.

339
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:40,200
没有必杀目击证人或其它有力的证据
能证明我的委托人确实做错了事
No smoking-gun witness or any credible
evidence that my client did anything wrong.

340
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,360
你确定吗
You're sure about that?

341
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,160
这样下去是个僵局 Patty
你我都心知肚明
It's a draw,patty,and we both know it.

342
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,240
现在如果我们法庭上见
谁都没把握胜
Now,we go in that courtroom,we
might as well flip a coin.

343
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,360
俩旧相识之间一定要弄成这样吗？
Is that any way for two
old friends to do business?

344
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,240
你们开价多少
What's your number?

345
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,920
我不敢保证有2亿那么多
但...
Well,I'm not saying i could
go as high as 200,but...

346
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,200
大概到底多少?
But in the ballpark?

347
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:13,680
我们先口头商量 我觉得1.5亿
Oh,we're just talking
here,but I think 150...

348
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,560
大概能让你满意
would probably get you a deal.

349
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,520
或者 1.75亿
Maybe even... 175.

350
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,920
- 怎么
- Larry这事我说对了吗
- So...
- Was I right about larry?

351
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,680
是的 Peter
Yes,peter.

352
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,200
Popler先生泄露情报给
Frobisher团伙
Mr.Popler's leaking
information to frobisher's camp.

353
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,720
你怎么知道的
How do you know?

354
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,480
我告诉他和解赔偿约在1.75亿
I gave him 175 as a settlement number.

355
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,360
Ray Fiske马上给我开同样的价
Ray fiske brought it right back to me.

356
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,080
那你打算怎么办
So what are you going to do?

357
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,800
可惜我们不能以此作为
对付Frobisher的证据
Unfortunately,we don't have the
evidence to use this against frobisher.

358
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,000
没有书面上的记录
没有金钱交易
There won't be a paper
trail,money exchanged.

359
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,680
我觉得现在最好不采取任何行动
I think the best thing to
do right now is nothing.

360
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,400
继续盯着Larry
We'll keep an eye on larry.

361
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,240
同时 向其他委托人保密
In the meantime,let's not mention
this to the other client reps.

362
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,120
自从Gregory Malina未出现作证
我们的调查员一直在找他
Our investigators are trying to locate gregory
malina since he skipped out on his deposition.

363
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,000
但Malina先生好像蒸发了一般
Unfortunately,mr.Malina
seems to have disappeared.

364
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,440
就这些吗
So that's it?

365
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,920
我们拿不到他的证词?
We don't have his testimony?

366
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,880
Larry 别着急 让他们说完
Relax,larry. Just let them talk.

367
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,360
当然我们仍在找他
Of course,we're still looking for him,

368
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,120
不过一旦某人离开本州...
but once someone leaves the state...

369
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,040
这个证人怎么会就这么消失了?
How the hell does a witness
just up and disappear?

370
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,480
我觉得你该明白我们要对付的是谁
I think you all should
know what we're up against.

371
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,680
我们有理由相信 在Malina先生作证前
他的人身安全就受到威胁
We have reason to believe that mr.Malina's
life was threatened prior to the deposition.

372
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,240
很可能是控方的人找到了他
It's quite possible that
the other side got to him.

373
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,120
你什么意思
What are you saying?

374
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,600
他被杀了?
He's been killed?

375
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,840
我们正就此可能性进行调查 是的
We're seriously looking
into that possibility,yes.

376
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,600
您现在进入的是Arther Frobisher
先生的语音信箱 请留言 并祝您一天愉快
**********

377
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,800
这整个星期我都在给你留言

I've been leaving messages
all week.Call me back.

378
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,440
我们得开始打算
We got to get going here.

379
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,200
记得回电话
So,call me back.

380
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,680
Larry 晚餐好了
Larry,dinner's ready.

381
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,800
你认为他们杀了Gregory
You think they killed this gregory guy?

382
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,120
我们不知道
We don't know.

383
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,480
他再也没打过Katie电话 对吧
He never tried to call
katie again,did he?

384
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,280
是的
No.

385
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,840
打过一次
No,just that once.

386
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,400
- Ellen 如果这是真的...
- 我知道
- Ellen,if this is true...
- I know.

387
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,320
谢谢你们能来 我很感激
Thank you guys for showing
up. I appreciate that.

388
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,880
明天见
See you tomorrow.

389
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,400
哦 天哪 载我回家 伙计
Oh,boy.Take me home,man.

390
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,360
你杀了那个孩子吗
Did you kill that kid?

391
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,000
什么
What?

392
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,440
你到底是个什么人?
What kind of man are you?

393
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,560
你到底在说什么
What the hell are you talking about?

394
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:27,720
那个证人 Gregory Malina
Patty Hewes说他被人除掉了
That witness-- gregory malina--
patty hewes says he was knocked off.

395
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,040
哦 我的老天爷
Oh,for christ's sake.

396
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,760
我究竟得告诉你多少次 Larry
那个女人是疯子
How many times I got to tell
you,that woman is crazy,larry.

397
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,960
我...我根本不知道你在说什么
I don'T... I don't know
what you're talking about.

398
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,320
我不认识什么Gregory Malina
I don't know any gregory malina.

399
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,640
你到底什么毛病
What's the matter with you?

400
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,280
我给你打了一星期的电话
I've been calling you all week.

401
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,280
得了 冷静点 行吗
All right,just relax,will you?

402
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,480
很晚了 我们明天再谈好吗
It's late. Can't we do
this tomorrow,please?

403
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,440
我得要我的钱
I need my money!

404
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,840
- 先生 请你退后
- 嘿 Derek Derek Derek 没关系
- Sir,I need you to stand back.
- Hey,derek,derek,derek,come on. Hey,derek,derek,derek,come on.

405
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,480
不要紧 Larry是我的朋友
这边来
Hey,it's all right.Larry's a
friend of mine.Come here,come here.

406
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,400
你现在不会希望我给你什么钱
You don't want me to give
you any money right now.

407
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,120
相信我
Trust me.

408
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,720
现在为止
我们俩都没做过什么违法的事
So far neither of us has
done anything illegal.

409
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,920
你答应过我
You gave me your word.

410
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,000
听好了
Listen to me,will you?

411
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,560
给你钱就是犯罪 明白吗
Giving you money is a crime,all right?

412
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,120
这是行贿受贿 妨碍司法程序
It's bribery,obstruction of justice.

413
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,760
我们俩都会进监狱的
We could both go to jail.

414
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,200
别这样
Come on.

415
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,240
对我们来说就这样最好
It's the best way for
both of us. All right?

416
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,760
嘿 到这来
Hey,come here.

417
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,920
你住在泽西 对吗
You live in jersey,right?

418
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,040
给他20块
Give him a 20,will you?

419
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:29,800
为你自己好
你还是打个车回家吧 去吧
Just do yourself a favor-- get
a cab and go home,please.Come on.

420
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,480
Patty Hewes也长耳朵
Patty hewes has ears,too.

421
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,000
也许我找错了人
Maybe I'm talking to the wrong person.

422
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,800
Larry 别想威胁我
Larry,you don't want to threaten me.

423
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,520
拿上钱
Take the money.

424
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,800
我给你抹过地板 你这个婊子养的
I mopped your floors,you son of a bitch!

425
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,600
哦 该死的
Oh,shit.

426
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,880
替你清扫了34年的垃圾!
34 years I cleaned your shit.

427
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,760
你在干吗 别那么粗鲁 伙计
What are you doing? Be gentle here,man.

428
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,120
你下地狱去吧
I hope you burn in hell!

429
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,040
哦 上帝...喂 是我
Oh,for chri... yeah,it's me.

430
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,880
我们得谈谈
We need to talk.

431
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,780
我们不辞而别 很是抱歉
I'm sorry we had to run off like that.

432
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,300
我很钦佩你 挂住探望这个女士
Dad,I admire you wanting
to visit this woman,

433
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,660
但从法律的角度考虑
这不是妙招
but legally it was not a good move.

434
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,700
这不是什么招
It wasn't a move.

435
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,260
我知道
I get it.

436
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,940
但想给她送松饼这这种事会被对方利用
反将你一军
But bringing her muffins,that kind
of thing can be used against you.

437
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,860
这等于间接承认自己有罪
It's an admission of guilt.

438
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,620
我开车撞了她
I hit the woman with my car.

439
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,580
我把她送到医院
I sent her to the hospital.

440
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,540
难道我就不该去探望她吗
I'm not supposed to go visit her?

441
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,300
不幸的是 不能
Unfortunately,no.

442
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,940
你也不能认错
And you can't apologize,either.

443
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,100
你卷入了一起官司
You're involved in a lawsuit.

444
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,540
你得明哲保身
You have to protect yourself.

445
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,460
妈妈 知道吗 我不饿
Mom,you know what? I'm not hungry.

446
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,620
胡说
Nonsense.

447
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,900
Ellen 我见过那个女人
Ellen,I met the woman.

448
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,900
我亲眼看到
I looked her in the eye.

449
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,700
在未来的2年里
她都要接受物理治疗
She's going to need physical
therapy for the next two years.

450
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,540
你并不需要为她买单
It's not your job to get her bills paid.

451
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,420
这是她律师该操心的事
It's her lawyer'S.

452
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:47,340
我并不觉得她的律师
比保险公司的推销员更可靠
Well,I don't trust her lawyer any more than
I trust the guy from the insurance company.

453
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,500
对他们来说 不过是个游戏
It's all a game to them.

454
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,820
是的
Yes,it is.

455
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,180
你可能会输了这场游戏
And you could lose.

456
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:54,740
这就是在这次庭证中
你得保证回答简短
That is why,in this deposition,you
have to keep your answers brief.

457
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,900
- 别添油加醋
- 好吧
- Do not elaborate.
- Fine.

458
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,980
简单点
Keep it simple.

459
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,740
坚持事实 那个女人站在哪儿
你当时开多快
Stick to the facts-- where the woman
was standing,how fast you were driving.

460
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,340
类似这些 知道吗
That kind of thing. Understand?

461
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,620
知道了
Yeah,got it.

462
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,100
我觉得我应该陪着你
I think I should be there with you.

463
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,220
不需要
Not necessary.

464
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,980
Gary 她已经不是12岁了
她是个律师
Gary,she's not a 12-year-old
anymore; she's a lawyer.

465
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:11,860
让她帮助你
Let her help you.

466
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,140
她还要上班
She has to be at work.

467
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,260
不是吗
Don't you?

468
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,060
我会抽时间的 我会去的
I'll make time. I'll be there.

469
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:45,900
噢 这里看起来是块不毛之地啊
Well... this looks like
a whole lot of nothing.

470
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,980
你知道谁本州的
这块地是谁建起来的吗
You know who built up
this part of the state?

471
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,380
黄蜂
Wasps.

472
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,060
海狸
Beavers.

473
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,220
没明白你的意思
You lost me.

474
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,820
真的 我没玩笑
No,I'm not kidding.

475
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,740
以前这里满是海狸
Place was flush with them.

476
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,500
印第安人捕获海狸
拿它们来交易
Indians used to trap them and
then trade them for everything--

477
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,060
换来毛毯 短柄斧 铁壶
blankets,hatchets,iron kettles.

478
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,540
之后他们看上了白人的货物
Then when they got hooked
on the white man's goods,

479
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:08,340
他们开始拿他们仅剩的物品来交易
they started trading the only
other thing they had left.

480
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,020
水獭皮?
Otters?

481
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,540
不 傻瓜 是土地
No,you idiot.Land.

482
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,420
我想把这里开发出来
I'm going to develop this.

483
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:17,500
房地产可不是你擅长的生意
Real estate-- that's
not your thing.

484
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,820
我早已厌倦像这样隔岸观火
知道吗
I'm sick and tired of standing around
the sidelines like this,you know?

485
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,700
我得 我得建造出个名堂来
I need to... I need to build something.

486
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:29,380
你想告诉我Gregory Malina
现在怎么样了吗?
You want to tell me what
happened to gregory malina?

487
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,820
别问我 问Ray Fiske
Don't ask me; ask ray fiske.

488
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,980
问的时候 别忘了问他
当初他是怎么认识他的
And while you're at it,ask him how
he knows malina in the first place,

489
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:38,180
并问他为什么在棕榈海滩
让他弄了间公寓?
and why he used him to set
up the condo in palm beach.

490
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,300
问这些又能怎样?
What difference does that make?

491
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,300
我不信任他
I don't trust him.

492
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,260
五年前 为了你我铤而走险
Five years ago,I went
out on a limb for you.

493
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,140
身处险境的人不只你一个
You're not the only one in
the line of fire here,arthur.

494
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:48,380
Gregory Malina现在怎么样了
What happened to gregory malina?

495
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:53,060
看来我们的小Gregory Malina
终究都要出庭作证
Looks like our boy gregory malina's
going to be deposed after all.

496
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,980
确保这次不要失手
Make sure it doesn't
get screwed up this time.

497
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,980
我亲自出马
I'll do it myself.

498
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,700
我以为你不想知道
I thought you didn't want to know.

499
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,900
我现在想知道
I do now.

500
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:29,180
喔 抱歉
Ooh,excuse me. Sorry.

501
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,660
- 他叫什么
- Theo
- What's his name?
- Theo.

502
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,940
Hewes女士 之前在你办公室里时
Um,ms.Hewes,when we were in your office,

503
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,540
你是在暗示我应该开除他吗?
were you suggesting
that I should fire him?

504
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,980
为什么这么问?
Why?

505
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,860
你想开除他吗?
You want to fire him?

506
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,180
他刚开始这份工作
我想应该再给他点时间
He just started. I thought
I should give him some time.

507
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,660
他是你的助理 你看着办
He's your assistant. Do what you want.

508
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,380
发现什么了吗?
Anything jumping out at you?

509
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,220
还没有
Not yet.

510
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:55,060
证券交易监委有个官员一直死咬
着Frobisher的公司不放
There is an official from the sec who was very
aggressive in going after frobisher's company.

511
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,020
Tom跟我都认为该跟他谈谈
Tom and I thought he
might be worth talking to.

512
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:57,900
是谁?
His name?

513
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,700
George Moore
George moore.

514
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,740
我想他那没什么线索
I don't think there's anything there.

515
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,460
政府公诉的时候
Moore被询问过多次
Moore was interviewed extensively
for the government trial.

516
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,900
我们就想听听他的意见
I thought we'd just pick his brain.

517
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,100
如果Tom觉得这有用 我没意见
If tom thinks it's
useful,it's fine with me.

518
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:12,580
Hewes女士
明天我可以外出一会吗?
Uh,ms.Hewes,is it okay if tomorrow
I step out for a few hours?

519
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,820
要干吗?
What for?

520
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:16,020
我父亲开车撞伤了个女人
My father hit a woman with his car.

521
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:19,660
法庭传唤他出庭作证
我想我最好陪着他
He's being deposed,and i
thought that I should be there.

522
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,580
当然可以
Well,of course.

523
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,620
是他的责任吗?
Is he at fault?

524
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,820
他是这么认为的
He seems to think so.

525
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:27,900
我是说 他是那种愿意负责的人
I mean,he's the kind of guy who
likes to take responsibility.

526
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,700
最好当心
Better be careful.

527
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,180
原告可能会很恶毒
We plaintiff attorneys can be vicious.

528
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,580
最好的辩护策略就是怪罪受害人
His best strategy is
to blame the victim.

529
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,460
我知道
I know.

530
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:39,740
不计代价 都是受害人的错
就这样
At all costs. It was her fault,period.

531
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,660
他在浴室 马上就出来
He's in the bathroom,but
he'll be back in a minute.

532
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,060
很抱歉打扰你们吃晚饭了
I'm so sorry to interrupt your dinner.

533
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,660
噢...
Oh...

534
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,060
你好 你肯定是Chloe
Hello.You must be chloe.

535
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,340
我是Patty Hewes
Patty hewes.

536
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,700
你是Rob吧 你好
And rob. Hello.

537
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,020
你来这干吗?
What are you doing here?

538
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,660
刚好来这附近
I was in the neighborhood.

539
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,940
就想过来见见你的家人
Thought I'd meet the family.

540
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,820
现在不方便
Now is not a good time.

541
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,540
明早我去你办公室吧?
How about I come by the office tomorrow?

542
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,260
等不到那时了 Larry
Ah,afraid it can't wait,larry.

543
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,940
Ray Fiske来见过我
Ray fiske came to see me.

544
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,660
他提出了一项和解协议
He offered a settlement.

545
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,940
太好了
Hey,that's terrific.

546
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,460
1.75亿
$175 million.

547
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,540
我们该接受吗?
Should we take it?

548
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,500
干吗问我?
Why are you asking me?

549
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:26,700
因为1.75亿是一个...有趣的数
Because 175 is A... interesting number.

550
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,180
我不知道你在暗示什么
I don't know what you're implying.

551
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,740
你一直跟他们私下来往
You've been talking to the other side.

552
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,700
你疯了吗?
Are you nuts?

553
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,300
不 你最好别说话
No,you don't want to do that.

554
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,860
刑事律师不在场
你最好保持沉默
Don't speak without a
criminal attorney present.

555
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,700
你已经要做3到5年的牢了
You're already facing three to five.

556
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,940
你怎么敢跑来我家指控我?
How dare you come in here and
hijack me with accusations?

557
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:46,220
是的 Larry 其实我挺喜欢你
但我觉得你自身难保
Yeah,the truth is,larry,I like you,but
I think you're in over your head,

558
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:50,100
而且你不该去坐牢
and prison is the last
place where you belong.

559
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,220
Arthur Frobisher很聪明
Arthur frobisher is smart.

560
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,860
我相信他用某种手段
侵占了你的血汗钱
I'm sure he's got a way to
get you your blood money,

561
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:59,580
而且没留下丝毫文书痕迹
所以我来是向你许诺
with no paper trail,so I'm really just
here tonight to make you a promise.

562
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,940
是吗? 许诺什么?
Oh,yeah? What's that?

563
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:07,060
我会一直盯着...
直到你用钱买房子
I'm going to wait and
watch... until you buy a house,

564
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:11,580
或Mildred买车
甚至是Chloe买牙刷
or mildred buys a car,or
chloe here buys a toothbrush.

565
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,860
你要搞清楚 Larry
You need to understand this,larry,

566
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:20,540
只要你家有人敢花这笔
钱的一分一毫
no popler for the next hundred years will
be able to spend a nickel of that money

567
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:25,460
都会被人羞辱 丢尽面子
并面临牢狱之灾
without being
humiliated,disgraced and locked up.

568
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,580
祝你们有个愉快的晚上
You all have a nice night.

569
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,520
辩方如何申辩?
How do you plea?

570
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,360
无罪
Not guilty.

571
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,600
被告没有潜逃可能 法官大人
Not a flight risk,your honor.

572
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,040
之前没有犯罪记录
No prior criminal record.

573
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,000
是守法良民
An upstanding member of the community.

574
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,120
保释金定为150万美元
Bail is set at $1.5 million.

575
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,760
下一个
Next.

576
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,560
你愿意起誓说出真相 全部真相
Do you swear to tell the
truth,the whole truth,

577
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,080
绝无谎言吗?
and nothing but the
truth,so help you god?

578
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,960
我愿意
I do.

579
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,160
注意到停车标志停下时
你看到Reynolds小姐了吗?
And when you pulled even with the
stop sign,did you see miss reynolds?

580
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,680
看到了
Uh,yes.

581
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,040
她在我左手边 大概离我10尺远
She was standing to my
left,about ten feet away.

582
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,920
你看到Reynolds
小姐朝你的车走来吗?
Did you see miss reynolds
walk towards your vehicle?

583
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,080
没有
No.

584
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,440
一点都没瞟见?
Not even out of the corner of your eye?

585
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,640
继续 你已经说过没有了
Move on. You already said no.

586
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,880
Parsons先生...
Mr.Parsons...

587
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,720
发生车祸时你的心情如何?
what was your general state of
mind leading up to the accident?

588
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,840
你能说清楚点吗?
How about being a little more specific?

589
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,240
你当时是否沮丧? 生气?
Were you upset? Angry?

590
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,280
车祸发生前 我跟我太太...
Uh,well,just before it
happened,my wife and I...

591
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,120
能休息5分钟吗?
May we take five minutes,please?

592
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,840
Parsons先生 我告诉过你
Mr.Parsons,I told you before,

593
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,680
你不用告诉别人你当时
情绪如何或你注意力是否在别处
no one needs to know your emotional state
or that your attention was somewhere else.

594
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,840
我当时正跟我太太争吵
我说的是事实
My wife and I were arguing.
I'm telling them what happened.

595
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,920
- 作为你的律师 我要告诉你...
- 你不是他的律师
- And as your attorney,I'm telling you...
- You're not his attorney.

596
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,040
你代表的是他的保险公司
You represent his insurance company.

597
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,760
我想跟父亲单独谈谈
I'd like a moment with my father.

598
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,440
爸爸 他是对的
Dad,he's right.

599
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,680
你跟那个混蛋意见一致?
You agree with that creep?

600
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,400
你的保险条款只会负担20万
Your policy only covers $200,000.

601
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,040
- 如果原告胜诉...
- 她有名字的
If the plaintiff is
awarded... She has a name--

602
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,400
Linda Reynolds
linda reynolds.

603
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,280
如果你承认有错而她获赔超过20万
那你就得自己负担那笔钱
If you admit fault and she's awarded more
than $200,000,you're personally liable.

604
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,160
本来就是我的错
It was my fault.

605
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,680
这是起事故
It was an accident.

606
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,040
如果是工作 你就走吧
If that's work,you should go.

607
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,360
那个律师反正都不是在为我争取
Look,this guy isn't even
fighting for me anyway.

608
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,120
他只不过要想拒付Linda
的医疗费用为保险公司省钱
He's just trying to save his company money
by refusing to pay linda's medical expenses.

609
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,040
我为什么要帮他呢?
Why should I help him?

610
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,560
因为她的律师会
争取尽可能多的赔偿
Because she's got a lawyer who's
going to go after every penny he can.

611
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,040
所以你认为我该撒谎?
So you're saying i should
just go in there and lie?

612
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,360
我认为他们会撒谎
I'm saying that they will.

613
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,520
他们会职责你有重大过失
They'll spin into gross negligence.

614
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,160
这个世界很现实 爸爸
This is the real world,dad.

615
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:51,120
我不用你教我什么是现实世界
Hey,I don't need you to
teach me about the real world.

616
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,800
我发了誓
I swore under oath.

617
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,600
你是律师 Ellen
你告诉我怎么做
But you're the
lawyer,ellen,tell me what to do.

618
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,960
我跟你说了很多次了
I've told you what
to do again and again.

619
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:10,440
Parsons先生
发生车祸时你的心情如何?
Mr.Parsons,what was your general state
of mind leading up to the accident?

620
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,680
谢谢你肯见我
Thank you for seeing me again.

621
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,600
感谢你来电 Larry
Well,thank you for calling,larry.

622
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,720
那晚的事让我很不舒服
I was sick about the other night.

623
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,360
发生的一切很糟糕
That was a terrible thing that happened.

624
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,480
我该向你道歉
Nah,I should apologize to you.

625
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,120
我压力很大
It's just I got all these pressures.

626
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,200
我明白
I get it,I get it.

627
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:44,080
Larry 事实上
我的律师反对我跟你接触
Larry,the truth is,my attorney
doesn't even want me talking to you,

628
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,760
所以直到审判结束以后
我才能补偿你
so I'm not going to be able to
make good until after the trial.

629
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,040
我理解 我能等等
你别忘了就行
I understand,and i can hold
out. Just don't forget about me.

630
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,960
拜托了... 记住我那份
Please... don't cut me out.

631
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,280
还有 证人的那件事?
Oh,that other thing,the witness?

632
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,920
我正在调查中
I'm looking into it.

633
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,840
谢谢你
Thank you.

634
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,760
你知道你让我想起谁?
You know who you remind me of,don't you?

635
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,160
我父亲
My dad.

636
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,080
这对我来说意义非凡
That means a lot.

637
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,320
是你这样的人造就了这个伟大的国家
Guys like you are what make
this country great,larry.

638
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,420
证券交易监委的人要提前会议
你能十分钟后准备好吗?
The guy from the sec wants to push
up our meeting. You ready in ten?

639
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,620
可以的
Sure.

640
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:31,060
妈 发生了什么事?怎么回事?
Mom. What happened?What's going on?

641
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:34,700
你爸爸不愿意给你打电话
但我想你应该知道
Your father wouldn't call
you,but I thought you should know.

642
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,500
知道什么?
Know what?

643
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:39,180
他们不光要我们负责医疗费用
They're not just suing us
for hospital bills anymore.

644
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,100
没事的
It's okay.

645
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:46,020
他们说那个女人的伤比想象的严重
她以后都无法工作了
They're saying this woman's hurt worse then
they thought,and she may never work again.

646
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,340
他们要多少钱?
How much are they asking for?

647
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:50,460
超过100万
Over a million dollars.

648
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,940
他们不能这样做 是吗?
They can't do that,can they?

649
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,500
我是说 不能就这么
认定我们欠她那么多钱
I mean,they can't just say
we owe them all that money.

650
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:57,180
妈妈 他们可以的
Yeah,mom,they can.

651
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:02,700
你爸爸没必要说出我们吵架的事
Your father didn't have to
tell them we were arguing.

652
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:05,780
Ellen? 车来了
Ellen? Uh,car's here.

653
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,660
你妈妈之前来电话了
Your mom called earlier.

654
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,540
我只是... 是我的错
I just... it's my fault.

655
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:20,940
我没找到机会...早点告诉你
I didn't have a chance
to... tell you earlier.

656
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,540
没关系
It's fine.

657
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,220
你知道吗?
You know what?

658
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:31,060
有关系 你被开除了
It's not fine. You're fired.

659
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,720
他们要带她去哪?
Where are they taking her?

660
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,600
Rikers岛
Rikers island.

661
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,560
我的天啊
Oh,my god.

662
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,280
保释要多少钱?
150万美金
What will it cost to post bond?

663
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,600
我们负不起啊
合解以后没那么多钱了
