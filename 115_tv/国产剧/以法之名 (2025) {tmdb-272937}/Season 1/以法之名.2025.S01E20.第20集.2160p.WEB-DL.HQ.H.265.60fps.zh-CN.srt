1
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,820
如果我是一只动物

2
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,980
如果我是天鹅

00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,260
艾玛：如果我是一只动物

蒂姆：我觉得它们一定很相爱
I think that's how they say they love each other.

8
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,220
如果它们在筑巢的话 也就是说

9
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,100
艾玛：它们马上要生宝宝啦
They're gonna have babies!

10

蒂姆：它肯定是在保护什么

蒂姆 为什么它要把蛋翻过来
Tim, why is she turning them over?

14

我们叫它毛毛吧
She can be called Fluff…

18
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,580
那只就叫路路
the other one can be called Floof…

19
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,660
灰色那只叫丽丽
and this grey one can be called Fliff!

20
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,900
蒂姆：嘿毛毛 别啄丽丽的脚
Hey Fluff, don't peck on Fliff's foot!

21
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,340
巢里大家都有位置
There's room for everyone in the nest!

22
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,940
艾玛：小宝宝们去哪了

23
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,660
啊 在这了
Oh! There they are

24
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,140
水肯定很冷
The water must be so cold!

25
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,140
不过毛毛很聪明
Fluff's super smart though.

26
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,620
如果我是天鹅宝宝
If I were a baby swan,

27
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,620
我也会想待在暖和又舒适的地方
I'd wanna stay somewhere cozy and warm too.

嘿 它在做什么
Hey, what's she doing??

29

蒂姆：小心点 丽丽
Careful, Fliff!

31
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,460
艾玛：啊哦 那只大鸟想要做什么
Uh oh, what does that big birdie want?

32
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,900
蒂姆：我记得这种鸟叫鸬鹚
I think it's called the Cormorant!

33
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,060
艾玛：走吧 丽丽 毛毛 路路

Alright, Daddy Swan,

37
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,820
现在示威够了吧

我说的是起飞 不是装傻
I said "take off", not be silly...!

41
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,900
艾玛：我喜欢它站在水上的样子
I like the way he pushes up on his feet!

42
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:07,180
哦不 下次好运啦 丽丽

45
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,180
就是这样 看看别人
That's it, watch the others!

46
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,220
