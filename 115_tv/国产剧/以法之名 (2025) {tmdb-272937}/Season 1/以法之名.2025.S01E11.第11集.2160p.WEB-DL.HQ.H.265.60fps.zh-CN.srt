1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,680
"以法之名" 前情提要...
Previously on damages...

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:03,840
你和Patty联系上了吗?
Did you get any word from patty?

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,400
我已经告诉她 她得回来
I've told her that she's
got to come back here.

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,880
她不想回来
She doesn't want to come back.

5
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,560
你认为 Patty要杀了你以自保?
You think patty tried to
kill you to protect herself?

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,280
我努力要了结这案子
I am trying to settle this case.

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,120
更努力点
Try harder.

8
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,680
她要和我离婚
She's divorcing me.

9
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,400
也许我会告诉他关于你和
Gregory Malina的事
Maybe I'll tell him about
you and gregory malina.

10
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,680
给我5分钟时间 Ray
Give me five minutes,ray.

11
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,840
我认为撞车行凶逃逸
都是George Moore一手策划
I think george moore engineered
this whole hit- and-run.

12
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,240
我觉得是他泄漏了阿灵顿事件
逼迫你和解
I think he leaked arlington
to get you to settle.

13
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,960
George Moore做了一场秀
假装调查Frobisher
George moore made a big show
of going after frobisher.

14
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,360
你不信他真要那么做?
But you didn't believe he was?

15
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,280
我跟你说这些 可能会被灭口
I could get killed for what I told you.

16
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,320
如果你和Arthur Frobisher有牵连
我们会查出来
If there's a connection between you
and arthur frobisher,we will find it.

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,360
我和George Moore谈过了
I spoke with george moore.

18
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,880
你怎么这么蠢?
How could you be so stupid?

19
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,240
别回来了
Don't bother coming back.

20
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,720
谢谢你的建议...
Thanks for the advice...

21
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,080
但我想我不再需要这个了
but I guess I won't be
needing this anymore.

22
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,720
发生什么事了?
What happened?

23
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,160
我告诉她我受够了
I told her I was sick of her bullshit.

24
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,360
你干什么了?
You what?

25
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,080
Ellen 你当助理律师 第一年工作
Ellen,you're a first-year associate.

26
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,360
Patty像我这么大时
会忍受像她那样的老板吗?
When patty was my age,do you think she
would have tolerated a boss like her?

27
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,480
不会
No.

28
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,560
那我为什么要忍?
Then why should I?

29
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,640
是因为案子吗?
Was this about the case?

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,880
部分是
Sort of.

31
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,200
我自己发现了些证据...
I uncovered some evidence on my own...

32
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,280
但Patty更感兴趣的是要我做
她安排的事 而不是我发现的证据
But patty was more interested in
putting me in my place than what I found.

33
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,760
我明白了
I see,mm-hmm.

34
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,520
她说一切都是为了案子 但不是的
She says it's all about
the case,but it's not.

35
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,280
一切都是她自己 及她的勾心斗角
It's about her and her mind games.

36
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,360
对
Yes.

37
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,440
我希望客户能赢得官司 但...
I want the clients to
win their case,but...

38
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,280
我不想成为Patty的出气筒
I'm not going to be
patty's punching bag.

39
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,720
你会卷土重来的
Oh,you'll bounce back.

40
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,360
所以我来找你 Nye先生
Which is why I'm here,mr.Nye.

41
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,040
我要一份工作
I need a job.

42
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,680
官司是永远打不完的 Ellen
The law will always be here,ellen.

43
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,640
你婚礼将近了 是吗?
But,um,your wedding
is coming up,isn't it?

44
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,040
对
Yes.

45
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,320
我早前工作时也犯过类似错误
You know,I made similar
mistakes early in my career.

46
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,720
都没度蜜月
Never took a honeymoon.

47
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,280
生命中美好时刻 不要错过
Don't let your life pass you by.

48
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,080
我知道
********

49
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,760
8天后
8 DAYS LATER

亲爱的 这简直是个噩梦
Babe,this is a nightmare.

54
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,180
什么事?
What is?

55
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,420
安排座位
The seating arrangement.

56
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:39,340
比律师考试还复杂
It's more complicated than the bar exam.

57
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,100
能让你表哥Jake坐在Heather旁边吗?
Can I sit your cousin
jake next to heather?

58
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,300
干吗总想给Heather找对象呢?
Why are you always trying
to pimp heather out,huh?

59
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,180
我只是觉得 他俩都...
I just thought,you know,they both...

60
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,220
都喜欢徒步旅行...
they both love hiking...

61
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,620
都喜欢嗑药
and narcotics.

62
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,260
他们有话题
they have lots to talk about.

63
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,340
Nye那边谈得如何?
How'd it go with nye?

64
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,340
他不愿意让我工作
He wouldn't give me a job.

65
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,420
他让我放个大假
He told me to take a vacation.

66
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,380
我爱死这家伙了
I love this man.

67
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,300
好吧 咱们晚点见
All right,I will see you later.

68
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,860
- 好吗?
- 好的
- Okay?
- Okay.

69
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,140
你好 David
Hello,david.

70
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,060
Patty
Patty.

71
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,100
我能进来吗?
May I come in?

72
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,220
你晚点给我电话?
Do you want to call me later?

73
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,820
好 我会的
Yeah. I will.

74
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,220
我一直在想 你何时出现
I was wondering when you would show up.

75
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,380
你搜集的文件让我惊叹
You impressed me with this.

76
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,220
我从来都没打算取悦你
I wasn't trying to.

77
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,580
搜集信息 利用信息而已
Just take the information and use it.

78
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,540
这资料很有吸引力
但对我们的案子有何帮助?
It's all very intriguing,but
how does it help our case?

79
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,980
George Moore曾负责证交会
对Frobisher公司的调查
George moore was heading up the sec
investigation into frobisher's company,

80
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,300
但据一位前任证交会调查员...
but according to a
former sec investigator...

81
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,460
Laura Watkins 据她说
Laura watkins.

82
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,420
我见过她
I met with her.

83
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,860
她相信Moore只是做秀
假装要扳倒Frobisher
She believed that moore was making a big
show of wanting to take down frobisher,

84
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,300
但却在背后暗地破坏调查
but behind the scenes he was
torpedoing the investigation.

85
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,180
剩下所有这些资料...
And all the
rest of this--

86
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,580
酒店入住记录 租车凭条 飞行记录...
the hotel records,the rental
car receipts,a flight manifest...

87
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,940
都显示Frobisher抛售股份前那个周末
All show that george moore
was in jacksonville,florida

88
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,460
George Moore在
佛罗里达州的杰克逊维尔
the weekend before
frobisher sold his stock.

89
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,660
Moore开车到棕榈海滩
向Frobisher告密
Moore drove down to palm
beach to tip off frobisher.

90
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,580
有意思的推理
It's a nice theory.

91
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,780
没证据证明
No proof.

92
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,420
那也要加以利用
Use it anyway.

93
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,020
给Moore施压
Put pressure on moore.

94
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,460
要干吗?
To do what?

95
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,540
逼Frobisher和解
Get frobisher to settle.

96
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,300
我之前不理解
为什么Moore要向我们泄密
I could never understand
why moore leaked arlington,

97
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,820
现在 全说通了
but now it makes perfect sense.

98
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,780
他一定害怕开庭后 一切真相大白
He must be afraid of what
would come out in a trial.

99
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:57,140
Moore希望案子快点结束
如果他发现你知道他的底细...
Moore wants the whole case to go away,and
if he knows that you're closing in on him...

100
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,860
会提供更多内情
供我们对付Frobisher
He'll give us more dirt we
can use against frobisher.

101
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,820
所以...
So...

102
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,820
我们得回头找Moore
we need to go back to moore.

103
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,420
我也这么认为
I think so.

104
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:15,620
我公司里 他只肯跟你一个人谈
And you're the only lawyer
in my firm he'll talk to.

105
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,060
这公寓不错
It's a nice apartment.

106
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,340
难道不是吗?
Isn't it?

107
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,500
回去找Moore吧
Go back to moore.

108
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,300
还有...
And...

109
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,820
当然 你能回来上班
of course you can have your job back.

110
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,060
我不想回去
I don't want it.

111
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,300
但我会和Moore谈谈
But I'll talk to moore.

112
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,300
我希望你能赢这场官司
I want you to win this case.

113
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,780
我们的上庭时间...
同志们 还有六周
Our court date--
six weeks,folks.

114
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,660
Tom要确认案子进展要点
如果他要你们做什么 就去办
Tom's running point,so if he
needs you to do something,do it.

115
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,140
提交证物 证人准备
Exhibits,witness prep.

116
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,980
这是最后期限
It is deadline time.

117
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,980
Felicia 专家名单有吗?
Felicia,do you have the expert list?

118
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,820
明天给你
You'll get it tomorrow.

119
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,780
就这样
That's it.

120
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,100
别让我失望
Make your mothers proud.

121
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,540
- Ellen今早去哪了?
- 不知道
- Where was ellen this morning?
- I don't know.

122
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,460
也许她不舒服
Maybe she wasn't feeling well.

123
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,820
Tom 办公室一半的人都看到
她几天前她大怒离开
Tom,half the office saw
her storm out the other day.

124
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,660
Patty解雇她了吗?
Did patty fire her?

125
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,100
把心思放在案子上
Just focus on the case.

126
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,140
所有人都在谈论这个
Everyone's talking about it.

127
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,340
- 该怎么跟他们说?
- 随你们便
- What are we supposed to tell them?
- Whatever you want.

128
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,700
告诉他们Ellen死了
Tell them ellen's dead.

129
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,260
把该死的专家名单给我就好
Just get me the goddamn expert list.

130
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,780
我希望她被解雇了
I hope she was fired.

131
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,260
我从不喜欢她
I never liked her.

132
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,740
Ray?
Ray?

133
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,820
你好
Hey.

134
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,740
你怎么来这儿了?
What are you doing here?

135
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,340
我想你可能需要午餐
I thought you could use some lunch.

136
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,060

00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,980
Patty 你什么时候宣布解雇Ellen?
Patty,when are you going
to announce ellen's firing?

277
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:23,100
我在办公室躲躲闪闪
回避同事的问题...
I'm-I'm-I'm running around the
office,avoiding people's questions...

278
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,780
然后?
And?

279
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:28,220
我现在是合伙人
我希望你把我当合伙人对待
And I'm a partner now,and I
need you to treat me like one.

280
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,620
如果你对Ellen有什么安排
我该知道
If you have plans for
ellen,i need to know them.

281
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,180
没安排
There are no plans.

282
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,300
那你该告诉同事
Then you should tell
the associates that.

283
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:39,980
Ellen联系了一个关键的线人
却没告知我们 她被解雇了
Ellen approached a key informant
without our knowledge,and she was fired.

284
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,740
大家该知道这些
People should know that.

285
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,940
去通告大家吧
Go announce it.

286
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,260
谢谢
Thank you.

287
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,860
Tom?
And,tom?

288
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:57,380
你说得对 你是合伙人
我该开始像对合伙人那样对你
You're right,you're a partner,i
should start treating you like one.

289
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,340
见鬼 Gregory 你就一个任务
Goddamn it,gregory,you had one task.

290
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,540
一个任务 你还搞砸了
One task,and you screwed it up.

291
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,540
我怎么知道那家伙提前出现了?
How was I supposed to know the
guy was gonna show up early?

292
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,380
你一开始就不该去那间公寓
You shouldn't have been in
the condo in the first place.

293
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,300
你该租好了 留下钥匙 去度假
You were supposed to rent it,leave
the key,and take a goddamn vacation.

294
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,220
对不起 Ray
I'm sorry,ray.

295
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,500
不过告诉你吧 那女孩什么也没看见
But I'm telling you,the
girl didn't see anything.

296
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,900
现在最重要的是你啥也别说
The important thing now
is for you to say nothing.

297
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,020
把这件事彻头彻尾忘记 明白？
You just forget any of this
ever happened,understand?

298
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,700
知道了
Yes,I understand.

299
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,900
我很抱歉 刚才我对你大吼大叫
Look,I'm sorry for
raising my voice at you...

300
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,780
是我的错
It's my fault.

301
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,380
我..我搞砸了
I-I screwed up.

302
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,420
我派你过去的
I'm the one who sent you down there.

303
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,740
听着
Listen.

304
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,620
为了派你去那边 而给你的报酬
That gift I gave you,for
going down there...

305
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,500
股票
The stock.

306
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,100
帮你自己个忙
Do yourself a favor.

307
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,740
明天把它卖了
Sell it tomorrow.

308
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,100
给我杯双份苏格兰威士忌
Give me a double scotch.

309
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,060
你相信吗?
Do you believe this?

310
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,060
我现在住在酒店
I'm staying in a hotel room.

311
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,220
我不能回到那座房子
I can't be in that house anymore.

312
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:43,100
你得给我找个最好的离婚律师
You better get me the best goddamn
divorce attorney in this city.

313
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,820
当然
Of course.

314
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,060
一场官司 一场官司的解决
One battle at a time.

315
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,500
谢谢  那足够了
Thank you,that's enough.

316
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,900
Art...
Art...

317
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,660
我们猜对了
we were right.

318
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,140
什么猜对了
About what?

319
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,820
George Moore
George moore.

320
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,340
他出卖你的
He sold you out.

321
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,420
阿灵顿那件事....
Arlington...

322
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,940
还有Gregory Malina...
gregory malina...

323
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,140
都是他干的 他出卖了你
it's all him.

324
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,180
你呆会要和Moore见面吗？
So you're meeting with moore again?

325
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,300
是的
Yeah.

326
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,820
他不愿意供出Frobisher
但是他愿意供出其他人
He won't give up frobisher,but
he's going to give us someone else.

327
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,900
你已经让他绝望了
You've got him desperate.

328
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,660
他想在案子波及他之前就结束
He's trying to make the case go
away before it closes in on him.

329
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:41,620
如果Moore向Frobisher告密
那也是犯法的
If moore tipped off
frobisher,that's a crime.

330
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,580
你干吗不以这项罪名告他?
Why shouldn't we just
go after him for that?

331
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,660
因为要以我们的委托人为优先
Because our clients come first.

332
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,860
刑事控告优先考虑
Criminal charges would take precedence.

333
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:51,220
我们的案件会被推迟上3年
Our case could get pushed
another three years.

334
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,660
我们早晚会告他的 Ellen
We'll get there,ellen...

335
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,900
一步一步来
once step at a time.

336
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,220
给你
here.

337
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,580
这是干吗?
What's this?

338
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,140
这够你用几周的
It should hold you over for a few weeks.

339
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,420
我不是为了钱
I'm not doing this for money.

340
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:18,380
我知道你不是 拿去吧
I know you're not,but take it.

341
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,940
不要犯傻了 Ellen
Don't be foolish,ellen.

342
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,700
总要吃饭吧
Everyone needs to eat.

343
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,940
- 妈妈
- 什么事
Mom? Yeah.

344
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,220
嘿..
Oh,hey.

345
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,660
不好意思打扰了
Sorry to interrupt.

346
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,460
Michael 这是Ellen Parsons
Michael,this is ellen parsons.

347
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,380
你好
Hi.

348
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,540
很高兴见到你 Michael
Nice to meet you,michael.

349
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,180
真好
Yeah,cool.

350
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,220
你今天晚上用车吗？
Are you using the car tonight?

351
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:39,580
我 Henry还有Julius
今天晚上要去Foxwoods
Me,henry and julius are
going to head to foxwoods.

352
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,340
去赌场?
To the casino?

353
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,460
你进不去
You can't get in.

354
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,780
妈... 用假身份证啊?
Mom... fake ids?

355
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,700
祝你们有个愉快的晚上
You guys have a nice night.

356
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,580
她还挺辣的
She's kind of hot.

357
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,660
你究竟去哪了 我等了将近...
Where the hell have you
been?I've been waiting for over...

358
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,380
你确定你没事吧
Are you sure you're all right?

359
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,460
我没事
I'm fine.

360
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,580
给你
Here.

361
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,980
真遗憾你经历了这些
I'm sorry you went through that.

362
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,060
我恨这些人
I hate these people.

363
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,260
这些照片将Ray Fiske和
Gregory Malina联系在一起
Photos link ray fiske to gregory malina,

364
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:36,060
还有文件可以证明
Fiske内幕交易的罪行
and the documents prove that
fiske's guilty of insider trading.

365
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,620
这对你应该有用
you should be able to use that.

366
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,420
这是勒索 Ellen
It's blackmail,ellen.

367
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,620
去做你该做的吧
Just do what needs to be done.

368
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:54,140
Frobisher先生提出用5亿和解
但Patty Hewes拒绝了
So mr.Frobisher offered $500 million to
settle,and patty hewes turned it down.

369
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,860
如此高价 按理说这个案子就该结束了
at that price,this case should be over.

370
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,460
她对自已力量估计太高了
She's overplaying her hand.

371
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,860
她坚信Arthur在采证庭里
Gone and convinced herself that

372
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:05,820
的爆发足以让她在陪审团
面前一搏
arthur's outburst in that deposition room will
be worth more to a jury than it actually is.

373
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,460
我祖父很喜欢你 Ray
My grandfather adored you,ray.

374
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,380
我还听说 人们以为你是他儿子
I'm told people thought
you were his son.

375
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:17,660
他是一个好人
还是个非常好的导师
He was a fine man,an even better mentor.

376
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:21,620
他肯定会为你的功绩而骄傲
Marshall
He'd be tickled pink to see what
you've made of yourself,marshall.

377
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,300
我们都很尊敬你 Ray
We all have the utmost
respect here for you,ray.

378
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,860
真的
We truly do.

379
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,220
我有话直说了
So I... I won't mince words.

380
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:34,620
高级合伙人对你处理这件案子
的能力失去了信心
The senior partners have lost confidence in
your ability to effectively try this case.

381
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,260
你一定在开玩笑
You've got to be kidding me.

382
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,700
你知道
And as you know,

383
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:44,380
Frobisher先生案子的结果
对这公司的未来有很大的影响
mr.Frobisher's case bears enormous consequence
to the future well-being of this firm.

384
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,900
合伙人们都想你现在别插手这个案件
The partners want me to
shadow you from here on out.

385
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:52,180
开庭后 所有策略方面的决定
你都要先征求我的意见
You'll consult me on any and all
tactical decisions as we move to trial.

386
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:57,140
Arthur Frobisher是一个很顽固的人
Look,arthur frobisher is a stubborn man.

387
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,420
顽固而且善变
Stubborn and complicated.

388
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:04,660
也就让这个案子的难度
超越了普通方法可以应付...
There are complexities to the case
that are beyond the normal scope of...

389
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,380
Ray...
Look,ray...

390
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:08,140
Marshall 抱歉 没有冒犯的意思
Marshall,I'm sorry,no offense,

391
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,740
但是我得跟Amos谈谈才可以
but I'm going to have to
talk this over with amos.

392
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,140
已经成定局了
It's been decided.

393
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,340
我会监督你的每一步
所以....
I'll be looking over your shoulder
every step of the way,so...

394
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,660
你要把你手上所有的资料上交
you'll turn over everything you've got,

395
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:21,500
在周末前让我接手
get me up to speed by
the end of the week.

396
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,500
你嘴里是什么 宝贝
What do you have there,girl?

397
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,580
让我看看
Let me see.

398
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,660
来...
Come on.

399
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:36,100
来... 张开嘴
Come on,girl,open up.

400
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,300
你可真喜欢狗啊
Don't you just love dogs?

401
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,220
是的
Yeah.

402
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,300
它们跟人很像
They're like people.

403
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,980
只不过没人那么麻烦
Only without the bullshit.

404
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,820
玩去  去
Go play,girl,go.

405
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,540
你委托人的代表有重新考虑
我们开出的价钱了吗?
Client reps rethink the offer?

406
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,660
这是什么
What's this?

407
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,340
这是我们的反击筹码
It's our counter.

408
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:14,060
出钱让Gregory Malina去弗洛丽达
的有钱老板
The wealthy patron who paid gregory
malina's way down to florida,

409
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,380
就是你吧 Ray
I'm guessing it was you,ray.

410
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,980
你从哪弄到的?
Where'd you get these?

411
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,860
有什么所谓吗?
Does it matter?

412
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:25,020
只是一些照片 Patty
They're just pictures,patty.

413
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:28,940
代表不了什么
They don't mean... anything.

414
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,540
看那文件
Read the document.

415
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:40,580
你把股票转让给了Gregory Malina
You transferred stock to gregory malina,

416
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:45,180
然后利用你从委托人那里
得到的消息让他抛售
then told him to sell using
information you got from your client.

417
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,780
你才不理会你的私人生活 Ray
I don't give a shit about
your private life,ray.

418
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,300
- 但是我不能放着这样的信息不用
- Patty...
- But I can't sit on this kind of information.
- Patty...

419
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:56,100
除非你和我能达成协议
Unless you and I come
to some arrangement.

420
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:00,660
Frobisher没可能开出更高的和解价钱
There is no way frobisher is going
to offer you a better settlement.

421
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,740
我也不想和解
I don't want one.

422
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:06,100
这件案子将在法庭上审判
This case is going to
be tried in a courtroom.

423
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:11,300
我不会故意打输官司
I am not tanking my own case at trial.

424
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,900
考虑一下吧 Ray
Think about it,ray.

425
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,980
花时间仔细想想
Take your time.

426
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,860
没什么要想的
I don't have to think about it.

427
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,900
Frobisher是我的当事人
Frobisher's my client.

428
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,900
还是我朋友
And my friend.

429
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:23,260
如果Gregory Malina还活着
我们也不用进行这段对话
We wouldn't be having this conversation
if gregory malina were still alive.

430
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,660
Ray 你是浸会教徒吧
You're a baptist,right,ray?

431
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,420
忏悔吧
Repent.

432
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,020
谢谢
Thank you.

433
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,860
Phillips呆会想和你谈谈
Mr.Phillips wants to
sit down with you later.

434
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,340
我会过去的
I'll be here.

435
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
我们刚收到第二份结婚礼物
I think we just got
our second wedding gift.

436
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,680
- 真的
- 是啊
Really? Yeah.

437
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,560
可能是Barbara阿姨送的
It's probably from aunt barbara.

438
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,680
她告诉我 上个星期她从网上定了东西
She told me she ordered
something online last week.

439
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,360
哦  等一下
Okay,hang on,mom.

440
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,600
你知道
- You know,
- Hang on.

441
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,960
网上订购不像人们说的那么简单
ordering gifts on the internet
is not as easy as people say.

442
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,560
我想在登记页面想找你的名字
I tried to find your
name on the registry page,

443
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,000
但光在纽约市的就有
六个叫Ellen Parsons的
but there were six ellen
parsons in new york alone.

444
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,840
不管怎样 这就意味着你得开始
寄感谢卡了
Anyway,you know this means you're going
to have to start sending thank you notes.

445
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,880

00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:49,300
我有没有告诉你我做律师的原因
Ray?
Did I ever tell you why
I became a lawyer,ray?

555
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:53,020
你没有和我说过
No,you never told me.

556
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,500
我以为我能改变世界
I thought I could change the world.

557
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,900
傻吧
Silly,huh?

558
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,860
我只是想每天都能带领带
I just liked getting
to wear a tie every day.

559
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:10,460
你和我就好像硬币的两面
You and I are two
sides of the same coin.

560
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,340
怎么说呢？
How's that?

561
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,700
我们喜欢较量
We love the game.

562
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,300
痴迷案件 追求赢大案子
Another case,a bigger win.

563
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,980
这比任何事情都让我们上瘾
It's an addiction like any other.

564
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,540
你在勒索我 Patty
You're blackmailing me,patty.

565
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,780
是的
Yes.

566
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,780
对不起
I'm sorry.

567
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,580
你我心知肚明
Long as we're clear.

568
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:33,340
Frobisher是有罪的
Frobisher is guilty,ray.

569
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,020
帮我伸张正义
Help me set things right.

570
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:35,860
你是我朋友
You're a friend.

571
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:38,060
我们能激出对方的真本领
We bring out the best in each other.

572
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:41,460
这个案子之后 我们还能交手
不知多少个回合
After this,we have a
hundred more rounds to go.

573
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,740
我觉得不大可能
I don't see how that's possible.

574
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:48,340
我不是想摧毁你
I am not looking to destroy you.

575
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,860
我们做律师的 最后都能挺过来
We attorneys survive.

576
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,700
而委托人却来的来 走的走
It's the clients that come and go.

577
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,900
我不能在法庭上
I can't go into a courtroom...

578
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,900
故意打输自己的案子
and deliberately lose my case.

579
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:03,540
Ray  我知道那很痛苦
I know it will be painful,ray.

580
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:07,700
但是从现在开始的六个月或一年后
一切都风平浪静
But six months,a year from
now,it'll all blow over,

581
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,380
你过来跟我一起工作
and you'll come work with me.

582
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,660
Patty...
Patty...

583
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,740
我认真的
I'm serious.

584
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,460
你真的会请我?
You would do that?

585
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:24,020
雇用我所交锋过的最厉害的
辩护律师?
Hire the finest goddamn litigator
I've ever come up against?

586
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,300
我当然会那么做 Ray
Yes,ray.

587
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,220
当然
Absolutely.

588
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:30,140
这里的职位非你莫属
There's a place for you here.

589
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:36,740
这对我们来说是双赢
It's win-win,for both of us.

590
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,140
好吧 Patty
Okay,patty.

591
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,900
很好 Ray
Good,ray.

592
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,220
我很高兴
I'm glad.

593
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,260
你知道...
You know...

594
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:10,700
我一直想和你一起工作 Patty
I always wanted to work with you,patty.

595
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,620
但我不再想跟你一起工作了
Not anymore.

596
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:27,180
