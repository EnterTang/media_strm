你告诉我你被解雇了
You told me that you were fired.

213
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,680
是的 但Patty要我去见George Moore
I was,but Patty needed me
to meet with George Moore.

214
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,920
你没想过该告诉我这些吗?
You didn't think that
you should tell me?

215

我不想你牵扯进来

你从George Moore得到的信息...
This information that you

part of the whole conspiracy.

220

所以Patty用这个威胁Fiske
So Patty used it as
leverage against Fiske.

221
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,680
所以他自杀了?
Is that why he killed himself?

222
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,640
我不知道

他们为所欲为
They do whatever the hell they want,

229
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,320
除非有人阻止他们
否则他们不会罢手
and they'll keep doing it
until somebody stops them.

230
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,760
Frobisher要负责任

你要回去给Patty卖命?
Are you going to go back to Patty?

235
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,280
这是我想做的工作 David
This is the kind of work
that I want to do,Dad.

236
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,640
Patty也许是个讨厌鬼 但...
Patty may be a horrible person,but...

237
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,080
那些人更残忍
these guys are ruthless.

238
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,000
我已经不知道你在做什么了
I don't know what you are doing anymore.

239
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,720
我知道自己在做什么

240
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,800

现在有人死了 在计划之中?
A man's dead now. Was that thelan?

242
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,840
他们对Katie做出那样的事之后
你们早就该明白
You of all people should understand
after what they did to Katie.

243
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,520
我不管他们 我关心我和你
I don't care about
them; I care about us.

244
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,560
这是代价
This is what it takes.

245
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,880
我不想这样的生活
I don't want this life.

246
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,760
得有人让这些人负责任
Someone has to hold
these guys accountable.

Ellen's gone.

415
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,980
你怎么会在这儿?
What are you doing here?

416
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,700
- 我给你放水洗澡
- 出去
- I'll run you a bath.
- Just get out of here.

417
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,420
- David 你能...
- 该死的够了
- David,will you...
- Enough of this shit.

418
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,700
- 别这样
- 滚出去
- Don't do this.
- Just get out!

419
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,380
你还没明白我们的感情
You don't know what we had.

420
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,540
我要叫警察了
I'm calling the police

421
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,220
你真该锁上门
You really should lock your door.

422
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,440
- Tom
- 天啊
- Tom.
- Jesus!

423
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,200
Patty 你去哪了
Patty,where the hell have you been?

424
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,760
探亲
Visiting family.

425
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,480
好吧 你得回来
Well,you need to get back here.

426
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,240
Ellen觉得你要杀她
Ellen thinks you tried to kill her.

427
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,680
Patty
Patty?

428
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,680
Patty
Patty?

429
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,120
我就回来
I'm coming home.

430
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,580
Parsons
Parsons.

431
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,220
你被提前释放了
School's out early.

432
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,660
怎么回事?
What's going on?

433
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,220
你被保释了
Your bail was posted.

434
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,660
谁保释的
By who?

435
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,020
一个叫Patricia Hewes的
You know a Patricia Hewes?

436
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,940
好了 你身上原来就
只有一窜钥匙
All right,sweetheart,all
you've got is a set of keys.

437
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,020
你律师给你送了套
换用的衣服
And your attorney sent
you a change of clothes.

438
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,820
在这签名
Sign right here.

439
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,300
也许我该进去
帮你拿点东西 呃?
Oh,maybe I should go in
and get your things,huh?

440
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,060
不了 谢谢
No. Thanks.

441
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,300
我只是想一个人呆会儿
I think I just want to
be alone for a while.

442
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,020
你真该锁上门
You really should lock your door.

443
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,740
那东西在哪儿
Where is it?

444
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,460
录像带在哪儿
Where's the videotape?

445
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,900
查查卧室
Check the bedroom.

446
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,420
找到了吗
What have you got?

447
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,220
把他带过来
Bring him in here.

448
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:24,660
那该死的录像带 在哪儿
Where... is the goddamn videotape?

449
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,860
我不知道
I don't know.

450
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,860
好的
All right.

451
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,420
我想我找到了些什么
I think I got something.

452
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,260
天啊
Jesus Christ.

453
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,780
带子呢
What about the tape?

454
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,420
不在那里
It wasn't there.

455
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,460
什么
What?

456
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,700
所以我们去了Patty Hewes的公寓
So we went to Patty Hewes' apartment.

457
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,140
然后呢
And?

458
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,060
出了点乱子
Things got a little fouled up.

459
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:20,100
什么出了点乱子
你这是什么意思?
What the hell is that supposed to
mean,things got a little bit fouled up?

460
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,180
就是说我们没有找到带子
Let's just say we didn't find the tape.

461
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,620
你到底去哪儿了
Where the hell have you been?

462
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,940
Ellen...
Ellen...

463
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,260
不管你是怎么想的
no matter what you think,

464
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:59,580
我和这没关系
I didn't have anything
to do with any of this.

465
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,660
我知道
I know.

466
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:07,660
但是Tom说 你指责我要杀害你
But Tom told me that you
accused me of trying to kill you.

467
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:11,020
我不知道除了这样
怎么才能让你回来
How else was I supposed
to get you back here?

468
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,020
那么这个录像带
So this videotape...

469
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,660
牵涉到Frobisher?
implicates Frobisher?

470
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,140
是的
Yes.

471
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,980
你有条新口讯
You have one new message.

472
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,140
Ellen 是我
Ellen,it's me.

473
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:29,260
Katie拿来一盘
Gregory Malina录的带子
Katie brought you a videotape
that Gregory Malina made.

474
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,700
我把它放在
我们的藏东西的地方 好吗
I'm going toeave it in
our hiding place,okay?

475
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,260
这就是为什么Frobisher
让人来找这带子
That's why Frobisher had
someone try to find it.

476
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,780
Frobisher的手下没有找到
But Frobisher's people didn't
find the tape in my apartment.

477
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,780
所以他们去了我家
So they went to mine.

478
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,980
但他们不知道我会在那
But they didn't know
at I would be there.

479
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,060
所以他们要杀了你
That's when they tried to kill you.

480
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:58,700
他们没有找到录像带
但那录像带在哪儿
If they ver found the tape,where is it?

481
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,660
在我手里 在安全的地方
I have it. It's safe.

482
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,700
好的 那我们
Good. Then we...

483
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,220
已经没有什么我们了
There's no we anymore.

484
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:09,060
我利用这几天仔细考虑过
I've had some time to think
over the past few days.

485
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,820
你雇我的唯一原因就是
为了引Katie作证
The only reason you hired
me was to get to Katie.

486
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,220
- Ellen...
- 别辩解了
- Ellen...
- Don't bother.

487
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,220
我老早就参透这件事了
I had that figured out
pretty early actually,

488
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,580
可那之后你又让Tom说服我
让我相信事情并非如此
but then you had Tom
convince me otherwise,

489
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,700
我又傻得相信了他
and I was stupid enough to believe him.

490
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,660
那时候
我没有发现他是个胆小的
At the time,I didn't
alize he's a scared,

491
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:24,020
软弱的 尽办法讨好你的骗子
weak,liar who would do
anything to please you.

492
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,620
- 我从没有...
- 别扯了
- I would never...
- Bullshit.

493
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:30,060
然后你又要分开我和David
你把Katie利用好了又丢弃掉
And then you tried to break up me and
David,you trashed Katie as a witness,

494
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,940
你又毫无理由的炒了我
and you fired me for no good reason.

495
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,900
但是你倒给我上了一堂
But you did teach me
one valuable lesson.

496
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,460
我的荣幸
I'm glad.

497
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,380
不要相信任何人
Trust no one.

498
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:49,020
不再相信任何人 Patty
Well,I don't anymore,Patty.

499
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,860
至少不相信你们这些人
Least of all you.

500
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,260
我明白了
I see...

501
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,980
我会把带子给你
I'll give you the tape...

502
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:01,500
但是你得先帮我做些事情
but you're going to do
something for me first.

503
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,300
什么
What?

504
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,780
做我的律师
Be my lawyer.

505
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:09,900
我被控告谋杀 你得还我清白
I've been accused of murder and
you're going to exonerate me.

506
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,180
我需要你的权力和你的关系网
I need your power and your connections.

507
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:17,580
洗清我的嫌疑
然后帮我找到杀David的人
Clear me of this,and then
help me find who killed David.

508
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,660
如果你这么做的话
If you do that...

509
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,820
我就会给你带子
then I'll give you the tape.

510
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:42,140
Ellen Parsons被保释出来了
你知道在哪儿能找到她
