2
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:36,146
(这部剧纯属虚构，与……无关)
(This drama is purely fictional and is not associated with...)

3
00:00:36,231 --> 00:00:37,337
(实际的人、组织、地点或事件。)
(actual people, organizations, locations, or incidents.)

4
00:00:37,422 --> 00:00:38,490
(拍摄符合COVID-19指南…)
(Filming was in compliance with COVID-19 guidelines...)

5
00:00:38,575 --> 00:00:39,517
(并为儿童演员提供咨询服务。)
(and counseling was provided for child actors.)

6
00:00:39,602 --> 00:00:40,646
(包括动物在内的大部分场景都使用了CGI。)
(CGI was used in most scenes that include animals.)

7
00:00:45,132 --> 00:00:48,601
有时，我会随机去打猎。
At times, I go on random hunting trips.

8
00:00:50,272 --> 00:00:53,542
这位老太太看到了一些她不该看到的东西……
This old lady saw something she shouldn't have...

9
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:57,242
最终成为了一个意外的目标。
and ended up as an unexpected target.

10
00:00:59,081 --> 00:01:01,182
直到它咽下最后一口气
Until it takes its last breath,

11
00:01:01,242 --> 00:01:03,381
猎物应该为宝贵的生命而战。
a prey should fight for dear life.

12
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:07,621
然而，这种特定的猎物缺乏这样做的能量。
However, this certain prey lacks the energy to do so.

13
00:01:08,492 --> 00:01:11,792
所以这次追捕太容易了
Which is what makes this hunt too easy...

14
00:01:11,892 --> 00:01:13,322
和无聊。
and boring.

15
00:01:30,242 --> 00:01:32,781
(我的第一名被别人抢走了。)
(I lost top of the class to someone else.)

16
00:01:39,152 --> 00:01:40,221
为什么我不能…
Why couldn't I...

17
00:01:41,382 --> 00:01:43,421
生来如此吗?
have been born this way?

18
00:01:44,391 --> 00:01:45,462
所有的好。
All good.

19
00:01:48,492 --> 00:01:49,561
我…
I...

20
00:01:50,162 --> 00:01:51,902
希望能像他一样。
wish to be like him.

21
00:01:53,962 --> 00:01:56,871
我希望成为他。
I wish to be him.

实验室里的小白鼠。

If it wasn't Sung Yo Han,

30
00:03:04,941 --> 00:03:06,841
(凶手Sung Yo Han住在这里。)
(Sung Yo Han, the murderer, lives here.)

31
00:03:07,202 --> 00:03:09,371
谁杀了我祖母?
who killed my grandmother?

32
00:03:12,082 --> 00:03:13,712
(集18)
(Episode 18)

33
00:03:15,182 --> 00:03:16,682
我留下了詹妮弗的照片。
I left behind the photo of Jennifer.

34
00:03:17,112 --> 00:03:19,052
容巴留姆去找它，
Jung Ba Reum went to find it,

35
00:03:19,682 --> 00:03:21,381
但如果他们先拿到呢?
but what if they get to it first?

36
00:03:22,522 --> 00:03:24,221
不，我们再等一会儿。
No, we'll wait a while longer.

37
00:03:29,262 --> 00:03:30,332
只是一个第二。
Just a second.

38
00:03:31,392 --> 00:03:32,561
真讨厌。
Darn it.

39
00:03:51,052 --> 00:03:53,281
那照片呢?你找到了吗?
What about the photo? Did you find it?

40
00:03:53,881 --> 00:03:56,091
为什么?这是一张照片吗?
Why? Is it a photo...

41
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,862
不应该被某些人看到吗?
that shouldn't be seen by certain people?

42
00:03:59,962 --> 00:04:01,022
什么?
What?

43
00:04:08,601 --> 00:04:11,601
有一天，我收到一个匿名者的短信。
This one day, I received a text from an anonymous sender.

44
00:04:13,202 --> 00:04:15,212
——一个文本?——我的妈妈,
- A text? - My mom,

45
00:04:15,612 --> 00:04:19,041
在民，还有我的继父。
Jae Min, and my stepfather.

46
00:04:19,281 --> 00:04:22,652
在我决定为我的家人报仇之后，
After I made the decision to avenge my family,

47
00:04:23,781 --> 00:04:25,221
我日夜寻找他。
I searched for him day and night.

48
00:04:25,881 --> 00:04:27,552
他不是有前科吗?
Is he not an ex-con?

49
00:04:28,082 --> 00:04:30,091
他看起来像是会出拳的人。
He looked like someone who knew how to punch.

50
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,531
(宋秀浩，一拳二拳)
(Song Soo Ho, One-Two Boxing)

(Mugwan拳击俱乐部)
(Mugwan Boxing Club)

53
00:04:42,971 --> 00:04:44,301
我们关闭。
We're closed.

54
00:04:47,741 --> 00:04:49,241
我立刻认出了他。
I immediately recognized him.

55
00:04:51,272 --> 00:04:52,741
就在那一天……
That's the day when...

56
00:04:52,741 --> 00:04:54,882
我内心被压抑的杀手释放了出来。
the suppressed killer within me let loose.

57
00:04:58,981 --> 00:05:00,351
在我的大脑植入手术之后，
Following my brain implant surgery,

58
00:05:01,351 --> 00:05:04,051
我的那一面因为宋友韩而沉睡，
that side of me laid dormant thanks to Sung Yo Han,

59
00:05:04,122 --> 00:05:06,192
但一件事把它推了回去。
but an incident pushed it back out.

60
00:05:08,122 --> 00:05:11,192
模仿我之前的杀人手法。
The killings that mimicked my previous ones.

61
00:05:15,372 --> 00:05:16,872
胡亨哲不是一个模仿者。
Woo Hyung Chul wasn't a copycat.

62
00:05:17,471 --> 00:05:19,541
在他犯下谋杀之后
After he committed the murders,

63
00:05:19,971 --> 00:05:21,872
有人留下了假胸针，假项链，
someone left a fake brooch, a necklace,

64
00:05:22,772 --> 00:05:25,442
甚至还有薄荷的味道……
and even the scent of mint...

65
00:05:25,712 --> 00:05:27,942
我作证说闻到了现场的气味
that I testified to smelling at the scene.

66
00:05:34,181 --> 00:05:36,091
我最后杀了吴亨哲…
I ended up killing Woo Hyung Chul...

67
00:05:37,252 --> 00:05:39,291
我内心的杀手再次苏醒。
and the killer within me awoke once more.

68
00:05:42,832 --> 00:05:43,962
会是谁呢?
Who could it have been?

69
00:05:44,962 --> 00:05:48,702
为什么有人把宋秀镐的位置发给了我?
Why was Song Soo Ho's location texted to me?

70
00:05:53,572 --> 00:05:54,572
究竟为什么?
Why on earth?

71
00:05:56,012 --> 00:05:58,272
为什么要上演胡亨哲的犯罪场景?
Why were the scenes of Woo Hyung Chul's crimes staged?

72
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,111
我不知道。
I don't know.

73
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:07,382
触发我。
To trigger me.

74
00:06:08,692 --> 00:06:10,921
唤醒我内心的杀手。
To awake the killer within me.

75
00:06:11,152 --> 00:06:13,091
我得到了一个猎物。
I was given a prey to hunt.

76
00:06:14,591 --> 00:06:17,762
他们这样做的目的是什么?
What could be their goal in doing such a thing?

77
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:25,171
他们从一开始就知道我出生了……
They were aware from the start that I was born...

78
00:06:25,241 --> 00:06:26,301
带有精神病基因。
with the psychopathic gene.

79
00:06:27,872 --> 00:06:30,642
我记得宋友韩临死前对我说的话。
I remembered what Sung Yo Han said to me before dying.

80
00:06:32,442 --> 00:06:35,551
据他说，我们只是小白鼠。
According to him, we were lab mice.

81
00:06:37,752 --> 00:06:41,281
你必须参与进来，让他们知道…
You have to be involved for them to know...

82
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:44,322
我们都有这种基因。
that we both had the gene.

83
00:06:45,861 --> 00:06:48,832
我…我不知道你在说什么。
I... I have no idea what you're talking about.

84
00:06:49,392 --> 00:06:50,431
你不?
You don't?

85
00:06:53,462 --> 00:06:54,702
那为什么我的日记…
Then why is my diary...

86
00:06:55,971 --> 00:06:58,332
还有宋友韩用来联系你的一次性手机
and Sung Yo Han's burner phone he used to contact you...

87
00:06:58,332 --> 00:06:59,872
在你的行李里吗?
over there in your belongings?

88
00:07:01,372 --> 00:07:02,971
用我能理解的方式解释一下。
Explain to me in a way that I'd understand.

89
00:07:06,942 --> 00:07:09,111
你从一开始就知道我是捕食者。
You knew from the start that I was the Predator.

90
00:07:12,382 --> 00:07:14,652
是的,我知道。
Yes, I knew.

91
00:07:17,252 --> 00:07:19,491
当我第一次听说韩国的连环谋杀案时…
When I first heard of the serial murders in Korea...

92
00:07:20,622 --> 00:07:22,361
可能是精神变态犯的
possibly committed by a psychopath,

93
00:07:23,462 --> 00:07:26,202
我以为凶手可能是两个男孩中的一个。
I thought the killer could be 1 of the 2 boys.

94
00:07:26,462 --> 00:07:29,101
激动之下，我直接来到了韩国。
Agitated, I came straight to Korea.

95
00:07:34,801 --> 00:07:35,812
当时,
Back then,

96
00:07:37,642 --> 00:07:39,812
我以为你杀了你的家人。
I thought you had murdered your family.

97
00:07:39,911 --> 00:07:42,181
所以我才确定你就是捕食者。
That's why I was sure you were the Predator.

98
00:07:42,681 --> 00:07:45,582
我去看了另一个男孩，以防万一。
I went to see the other boy just in case though.

99
00:07:49,752 --> 00:07:52,361
你应该好好照顾自己，知道吗。
You should take better care of yourself, you know.

100
00:07:52,661 --> 00:07:54,861
在他的眼里，我看到了明显的嫉妒。
In his eyes, I saw obvious jealousy.

101
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,931
你在真正的捕食者身上看不到的那种。
The kind you never see in a true predator.

102
00:07:59,101 --> 00:08:00,231
那时我才知道……
That's when I knew...

103
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:02,072
Sung Yo Han是无辜的。
Sung Yo Han was innocent.

104
00:08:02,931 --> 00:08:04,772
我试图阻止你杀人。
I tried to stop you from killing.

105
00:08:05,272 --> 00:08:06,671
你偏离轨道了。
You were going off the rails.

106
00:08:07,841 --> 00:08:10,772
经过再三考虑，我联系了宋佑翰。
After much consideration, I contacted Sung Yo Han.

107
00:09:07,502 --> 00:09:08,902
李医生!
Dr. Lee!

108
00:09:17,012 --> 00:09:19,681
不…没有医院。
No... No hospitals.

109
00:09:20,781 --> 00:09:24,051
他们……他们会残忍地杀了我。
They're... They're going to brutally kill me.

110
00:09:24,451 --> 00:09:26,022
谁……谁?
Who... Who?

111
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:31,108
首先，你得除掉他。
First, you need to get rid of him.

112
00:09:32,108 --> 00:09:34,578
谁……他是谁?
Who... Who is he?

113
00:09:34,848 --> 00:09:36,547
他为什么要这样对你?
Why did he do this to you?

114
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:39,547
你……你需要…
You... You need...

115
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:44,917
你得仔细听我说，韩友。
You need to listen to me carefully, Yo Han.

116
00:09:46,027 --> 00:09:47,787
那天，我把一切都告诉了他。
That day, I told him everything.

117
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,828
这就是他帮我的原因。
That's why he helped me.

118
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,328
我有治疗……
I got treated...

119
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:55,098
在他的地下室。
in his basement.

120
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,297
然后他带我去了废弃的医院。
Then he took me to the abandoned hospital.

121
00:10:03,838 --> 00:10:06,407
你欺骗我，利用我。
You lied to me and used me.

122
00:10:08,647 --> 00:10:09,647
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

123
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,218
我…我试图阻止他们。
I... I tried to stop them.

124
00:10:12,318 --> 00:10:14,047
你为什么不阻止他?
Why aren't you stopping him?

125
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:16,617
我们说好一旦他表现出杀人的本能就公开。
We agreed to go public once he showed his murder instincts.

126
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:17,958
我们同意重新提出议事日程。
We agreed to reintroduce the agenda.

127
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,027
(你为什么不遵守诺言?)
Why aren't you keeping your promise?

128
00:10:19,027 --> 00:10:21,157
已经死了好多人了!
So many people have died already!

129
00:10:21,157 --> 00:10:22,928
你怎么能眼睁睁看着他们死去?
How could you just watch them die?

130
00:10:22,928 --> 00:10:25,297
你疯了。你不能再这样下去了。
You're crazy. You need to stop this now.

131
00:10:25,297 --> 00:10:27,027
他现在失控了。
He's out of control right now.

132
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:28,568
你以为我会袖手旁观什么都不做吗?
Do you think I'll just sit back and do nothing?

133
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:31,938
这背后是谁?
Who's behind this?

134
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:34,808
告诉我是谁!告诉我!
Tell me who it is! Tell me!

135
00:10:35,438 --> 00:10:37,438
是谁?谁是混蛋?
Who is it? Who's the jerk?

136
00:10:46,417 --> 00:10:47,818
崔小姐，什么风把你吹来了?
Ms. Choi, what brings you here?

137
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,417
我想请你帮个忙
I had a favor to ask,

138
00:10:49,517 --> 00:10:51,257
但我想如果我在电话里问你，你可能会拒绝。
but I thought you might refuse if I asked you over the phone.

139
00:10:51,688 --> 00:10:55,497
我有个客人，我们能下次再谈吗?
I have a guest over, so can we talk next time?

140
00:10:55,497 --> 00:10:56,497
不会太久的。
It won't take long.

141
00:10:57,098 --> 00:10:58,598
你能做个采访吗，荣格警官?
Can you do an interview, Officer Jung?

142
00:10:59,797 --> 00:11:00,867
什么面试?
What interview?

143
00:11:08,978 --> 00:11:10,608
莫津连环谋杀案?
The Moojin serial murder case?

144
00:11:10,777 --> 00:11:13,478
是的。你是唯一的幸存者。
Yes. You're the only survivor.

145
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:15,517
所以我真的很想让你做个采访…
So I really want you to do an interview...

146
00:11:15,617 --> 00:11:17,017
那天发生的事。
about what happened that day.

147
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:23,017
我很快就会告诉你一切。
I'll soon tell you everything.

148
00:11:23,657 --> 00:11:24,688
但不是现在。
But not now.

149
00:11:36,598 --> 00:11:37,667
什么?
What?

150
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:04,397
——你好吗?——荣格。
- Hello? - Officer Jung.

151
00:12:04,397 --> 00:12:05,527
你怎么这么久才接电话?
What took you so long to answer your phone?

152
00:12:09,068 --> 00:12:10,667
谢天谢地他在打电话。

我一提到"警察"就停止了谈话。
stopped talking the moment I mentioned "police".

167
00:13:03,718 --> 00:13:05,787
-无法联系到接收者…-为什么柯警探…

(我们承诺保护我们公民的安全。)

205
00:14:54,568 --> 00:14:57,367
-在哪里?在哪里?——是什么?

206
00:14:57,767 --> 00:15:00,438
先生,冷静下来。先生!

他是怎么发现的?
How did he find out?

208
00:15:02,678 --> 00:15:04,178
他有什么证据?
What kind of evidence does he have?

209
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:06,247
现在不是时候
Now isn't the right time

210
00:15:07,147 --> 00:15:09,818
我得争取时间，直到找到杀害奇果的凶手。

212
00:15:13,188 --> 00:15:14,387
只是一个第二。
Just a second.

——停止它。-放开我。

214
00:15:20,428 --> 00:15:21,757
天哪,阻止它。

你们是在合作吗?

219
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:32,667
他清理现场的时候你负责杀人吗?
Are you in charge of the killing while he cleans up the scene?

220
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:36,277
你说我帮他收拾是什么意思?
What do you mean I cleaned up after him?

221
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:37,537
"清理现场"?
"Cleans up the scene"?

222
00:15:37,838 --> 00:15:40,377
车载摄像头录下了6264号车的录像，和上演的自杀。
The dash cam video of the car 6264, with the staged suicide.

223
00:15:40,377 --> 00:15:42,277
你从我这里偷走了，然后冲掉了!

224
00:15:42,718 --> 00:15:43,848
他被杀了吗?

00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:49,358
-别装作你不知道!——先生,请。
- Don't act like you don't know! - Sir, please.

226
00:15:49,358 --> 00:15:51,488
你为什么一直这样对我?
Why do you keep doing this to me?

227
00:15:51,558 --> 00:15:53,988
你看到我把它扔了吗?
Did you see me throw it away?

228
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,157
-他好像什么都不知道。——告诉我。
- He doesn't seem to know anything. - Tell me.

229
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:59,598
你看到我把录像处理掉了吗?
Did you see me get rid of the footage?

230
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:01,667
那你在浴室里做什么?
Then what were you doing in the bathroom?

231
00:16:01,767 --> 00:16:02,838
-我拉屎冲厕所了-他是…

232
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:04,198
-有问题吗?-组织的?

233
00:16:04,267 --> 00:16:06,667
-你们这些混球!——先生,请。

234
00:16:06,808 --> 00:16:08,007
木奇，够了。

235
00:16:08,838 --> 00:16:11,178
——这些朋克…-我说够了!

236
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:13,507
带他们去审讯室。
Take them to the interrogation room.

237
00:16:13,507 --> 00:16:14,578
-是长官-是长官
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

238
00:16:15,047 --> 00:16:16,348
真讨厌!
Darn it!

239
00:16:16,777 --> 00:16:18,617
很好。好的,很好。
Fine. Okay, fine.

240
00:16:18,718 --> 00:16:20,017
让我们好好调查一下。
Let's properly investigate them.

241

去审讯室。走了。
Go to the interrogation room. Get going.

242
00:16:39,838 --> 00:16:42,708
警探，你能让我走吗?
Detective, can you please let me go?

243
00:16:42,978 --> 00:16:44,877
侦探心!侦探心!
Detective Shin! Detective Shin!

244
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:46,808
请放我出去。
Please let me out.

245
00:16:46,808 --> 00:16:48,547
冷静下来。让我看看你的手。
Calm down. Let me see your hand.

246
00:16:48,547 --> 00:16:50,517
-我的手没事。-看起来你受伤了。
- My hand's fine. - It looks like you got hurt.

247
00:16:50,517 --> 00:16:51,718
小心。
Careful.

248
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:53,848
如果你把它弄成这样，会留下疤痕的。
If you leave it like this, it'll leave a scar.

249
00:16:54,117 --> 00:16:56,188
这是怎么呢
What's going on?

250
00:16:56,188 --> 00:16:58,088
-我不知道-柯警探为什么…
- I have no idea. - Why is Detective Ko...

251
00:16:58,088 --> 00:16:59,387
对巴留姆这么生气?
so angry at Ba Reum?

252
00:16:59,387 --> 00:17:01,058
等它干了就戴上。
Put this on once it dries.

253
00:17:01,058 --> 00:17:02,188
以后再用一些。
Apply some more of this later too.

稍等片刻。我们很快就会让你自由。
Just wait a little bit. We'll let you free soon.

255
00:17:05,968 --> 00:17:07,527
侦探心!
Detective Shin!

256
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:09,497
申探长，为什么柯探长认为…
Detective Shin, why does Detective Ko think...

257
00:17:09,497 --> 00:17:10,938
荣格警官杀了人?
Officer Jung killed someone?

258
00:17:10,938 --> 00:17:12,637
保持安静。停止说话无稽之谈。
Be quiet. Stop talking nonsense.

259
00:17:13,537 --> 00:17:14,808
他是怎么发现的?
How did he find out?

260
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,738
不能让他知道是巴留姆干的。
He can't find out that it was Ba Reum.

261
00:17:19,248 --> 00:17:21,847
冷静点，告诉我你在说什么。
Calm down and tell me what you're talking about.

262
00:17:22,427 --> 00:17:23,927
Ba Reum，那个朋克…
Ba Reum, that punk...

263
00:17:24,026 --> 00:17:25,667
我不知道你在说什么。
I don't know what you're talking about.

264
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:27,367
我查了行车记录仪的录像。
I checked the dashcam footage.

265
00:17:27,367 --> 00:17:29,637
但李警探从我这里拿走了在混乱中把它处理掉了。
But Detective Lee took it from me and got rid of it amid the chaos.

266
00:17:29,637 --> 00:17:30,766
他把它冲进了厕所

267
00:17:30,766 --> 00:17:32,107
我们得马上找!
We need to look for it now!

268
00:17:32,107 --> 00:17:34,006
天啊，我都快疯了。
My gosh, this is driving me crazy.

269
00:17:34,107 --> 00:17:36,046
我在浴室拉完屎出来，
I was coming out after taking a dump in the bathroom,

270
00:17:36,046 --> 00:17:37,947
但他突然抓住我的衣领，骂我。

271
00:17:38,006 --> 00:17:39,776
我亲眼看到了巴勒姆。
I saw Ba Reum with my own two eyes.

272
00:17:39,776 --> 00:17:41,147
他就在姜德洙被杀的现场。
He was at the scene of Kang Duk Soo's murder scene.

273
00:17:41,147 --> 00:17:42,816
我的猫生了一只小猫……
My cat gave birth to a kitten...

274
00:17:42,816 --> 00:17:44,816
姜德洙死的那天
on the day Kang Duk Soo died.

275
00:17:45,486 --> 00:17:47,417
我在家里陪我表弟。
I was home spending time with my cousin.

276
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:48,957
李警探故意花时间交了份供词。
Detective Lee purposely took time to hand in the statement...

277
00:17:48,957 --> 00:17:50,056
这是姜德洙的母亲写的。
that Kang Duk Soo's mother wrote.

278
00:17:50,056 --> 00:17:51,887
我之所以迟交是因为我忘了。
I only handed that in late because I forgot.

279
00:17:51,957 --> 00:17:53,026
这是难以置信的。
This is unbelievable.

280
00:17:53,026 --> 00:17:54,996
那些人有同样的纹身。
Those guys have the same tattoos.

281
00:17:55,596 --> 00:17:57,096
-他甚至把它处理掉了。-那是个纹身…

282
00:17:57,096 --> 00:17:58,197
我前女友名字的首字母
of my ex-girlfriend's initials.

283
00:17:58,197 --> 00:17:59,566
我告诉他我把它扔了，因为我们分手了。
I told him I got rid of it because we broke up.

284
00:17:59,566 --> 00:18:00,637
你在哪里纹的纹身?
Where did you get the tattoo?

285
00:18:00,637 --> 00:18:04,266
他只染了指甲花。但有一天，他要求纹身。
He only got hennas. But one day, he asked for a tattoo.

286
00:18:04,467 --> 00:18:06,377
一个纹身吗?什么样的纹身?
A tattoo? What kind of tattoo?

287
00:18:06,477 --> 00:18:08,006
我们为客户拍照……
We take photos for our customers...

288
00:18:08,006 --> 00:18:09,377
-只要他们有纹身。——好的。
- whenever they get a tattoo. - Okay.

289
00:18:09,377 --> 00:18:11,647
-我会找的。-好吧，帮我个忙。
- I'll look for it. - Okay, please do me a favor.

290
00:18:15,076 --> 00:18:16,117
在这儿。
Here it is.

291
00:18:20,786 --> 00:18:22,826
谢谢你！祝你过得愉快。
Thank you. Have a nice day.

292
00:18:38,306 --> 00:18:41,336
他是和他女朋友一起吃的，是OJ，不是OZ。
He got it with his girlfriend, and it was OJ, not OZ.

293
00:18:41,536 --> 00:18:44,576
我知道它。说真的,朋克。
I knew it. Seriously, that punk.

294
00:18:51,147 --> 00:18:52,187
嗨。
Hi.

295
00:18:53,316 --> 00:18:54,387
什么?
What?

296
00:18:55,256 --> 00:18:56,857
好吧。明白了。
Okay. Got it.

297
00:18:58,556 --> 00:18:59,927
你妻子又失踪了吗?
Did your wife go missing again?

298
00:19:02,826 --> 00:19:04,026
可怜的家伙。
Poor guy.

299
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,637
这是多少次了?
How many times is this?

300
00:19:07,367 --> 00:19:08,836
——这是不同的吗?——这是正确的。
- It's different? - That's right.

301
00:19:09,736 --> 00:19:12,036
他肯定贿赂了纹身店的老板。
He must've bribed the tattoo shop owner.

302
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:14,576
他没有时间。康警探拿到了地址…
He had no time. Detective Kang got the address...

303
00:19:14,637 --> 00:19:15,977
申警探马上就走了。
and Detective Shin went right away.

304
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:18,006
不管怎样,回家了。
Anyway, go home.

305
00:19:18,076 --> 00:19:19,076
去哪里?
Go where?

306
00:19:19,147 --> 00:19:20,647
照我说的做，好吗?
Do as I say, will you?

307
00:19:20,717 --> 00:19:23,316
社交媒体上到处都是你殴打容警官的视频。
Videos of you beating Officer Jung is all over social media.

308
00:19:23,647 --> 00:19:25,846
你非得在平民和记者面前这么做吗?
Did you have to do that in front of civilians and reporters?

309
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:28,617
嘿。你忘记了吗?荣格军官是国子。
Hey. Did you forget? Officer Jung is the National Son.

310
00:19:28,687 --> 00:19:31,326
你成了那个痛打那个可怜孩子的叛徒。
You became the National Traitor who beat up the poor kid.

311
00:19:31,387 --> 00:19:33,857
不管是不是叛徒，我都不在乎。
Traitor or not, I don't care.

312
00:19:34,657 --> 00:19:37,826
“国家的儿子”?整个国家都将陷入极度震惊之中。
"National Son"? The entire nation will be in utter shock.

313
00:19:38,026 --> 00:19:41,137
你应该关心。我们刚接到上级打来的电话…
You should care. We just got a call from above...

314
00:19:41,496 --> 00:19:42,867
暂停你的。
to suspend you.

315
00:19:44,836 --> 00:19:45,836
你现在要去哪里?
Where are you going now?

316
00:19:45,937 --> 00:19:47,107
去经历垃圾场!
To go through dump!

317
00:19:47,276 --> 00:19:49,006
我会找到那张记忆卡的。
I'll find that memory card.

318
00:19:53,217 --> 00:19:55,016
李敏秀也和奥兹在一起?
Lee Min Soo is with OZ too?

319
00:19:55,177 --> 00:19:57,647
车载摄像头录下了6264号车的录像，和上演的自杀。
The dash cam video of the car 6264, with the staged suicide.

320
00:19:59,516 --> 00:20:01,286
它钓了多少鱼?
How much did it catch?

321
00:20:02,556 --> 00:20:04,786
荣格警官，回家休息吧。
Officer Jung, go home and rest.

322
00:20:06,227 --> 00:20:08,796
原谅我。李警探呢?
Excuse me. What about Detective Lee?

323
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,127
我也把他送回家了。
I just sent him home too.

324
00:20:22,858 --> 00:20:25,288
(请登入警务处数据库)

00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:34,697
(姓名:李敏秀地址:莫津书谷)
(Name: Lee Min Soo Address: Book-gu, Moojin City)

326
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,947
Ki Hyuk，放她走。
Ki Hyuk, let her go.

327
00:20:53,717 --> 00:20:55,558
不管原因是什么，你不能袭击警官。
Whatever the reason may be, you can't assault an officer.

328
00:21:00,157 --> 00:21:01,498
英航Reum在哪?
Where's Ba Reum?

329
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:06,838
我马上回来。
I'll be right back.

330
00:21:07,637 --> 00:21:08,768
我将这样做。
I'll do it.

331
00:21:09,238 --> 00:21:11,068
不，我去拿。
No, I'll get it.

332
00:21:11,407 --> 00:21:13,538
就算我被抓了，我们也得有一个人活着。
One of us must stay alive even if I get caught.

333
00:21:13,637 --> 00:21:17,008
那个人一定是你。你必须完成这一切。
That person must be you. You need to finish this.

334
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:38,427
我该怎么办?
What do I do?

335
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:41,098
韩哟……
Yo Han...

336
00:21:43,707 --> 00:21:45,167
韩哟……
Yo Han...

337
00:21:47,407 --> 00:21:49,677
我可怜的Yo Han…
My poor Yo Han...

338
00:22:00,457 --> 00:22:01,457
它去哪儿了?
Where did it go?

339
00:22:01,917 --> 00:22:04,528
你还活着，丹尼尔·李医生。
So you're alive, Dr. Daniel Lee.

340
00:22:14,437 --> 00:22:15,437
嘿!
Hey!

341
00:22:16,467 --> 00:22:17,508
发生了什么事?
What happened?

342
00:22:17,508 --> 00:22:19,338
我去了肉类区一分钟然后…
I went to the meat section for just a minute and...

343
00:22:19,677 --> 00:22:21,278
她也留下了她的毛衣。
She left her sweater too.

344
00:22:21,738 --> 00:22:22,738
(爆炸Yoo华)
(Bang Yoo Hwa)

345
00:22:24,078 --> 00:22:26,147
谢谢你的辛勤工作。你介意我看一下吗?
Thank you for your hard work. Do you mind if I take a look?

346
00:22:36,058 --> 00:22:37,387
——她离开。——什么?
- She left. - What?

347
00:23:07,788 --> 00:23:09,157
请稍等。
Please hang on.

348
00:23:10,187 --> 00:23:11,687
很快就是登陆日了。
It'll be d-day soon.

349
00:23:50,127 --> 00:23:52,268
-荣格警官在哪里?——你臭。
- Where's Officer Jung? - You stink.

350
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:55,137
你真的挖了大便吗?
Did you really dig in the poop?

351
00:23:56,038 --> 00:23:57,068
你找到了吗?
Did you find it?

352
00:23:58,068 --> 00:23:59,137
太小了。
It's too small.

353
00:23:59,207 --> 00:24:01,377
你臭。去洗洗。出去。
You stink. Go and wash up. Get out.

354
00:24:01,437 --> 00:24:02,538
英航Reum在哪?
Where's Ba Reum?

355
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:03,748
我让他回家了!
I sent him home!

356
00:24:03,808 --> 00:24:05,977
为什么?如果他毁了证据怎么办?
Why? What if he destroys evidence?

357
00:24:06,617 --> 00:24:09,278
-敏秀呢?-他发邮件要求休假。
- What about Min Soo? - He emailed a vacation request.

358
00:24:09,887 --> 00:24:11,848
——一个假期?-别靠近!你的气味。
- A vacation? - Don't come closer! You smell.

359
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,217
看到了吗?他脱下!
See? He took off!

360
00:24:14,657 --> 00:24:17,687
闵秀说他不会就这么拿走。他说他要告你!
Min Soo says he won't just take it. He says he'll sue you!

361
00:24:34,937 --> 00:24:36,177
气怪人的杀手。
Chi Kook's killer.

362
00:24:37,308 --> 00:24:38,308
李侦探。
Detective Lee.

363
00:24:51,368 --> 00:24:52,438
你的问题是什么?
What's your problem?

364
00:24:53,477 --> 00:24:54,477
你为什么在里面?
Why were you in there?

365
00:24:56,707 --> 00:24:58,378
你们俩不是约在这里见面吗?
Were you two supposed to meet here?

366
00:25:02,818 --> 00:25:05,588
我因为殴打国民之子而被停赛。
I was suspended for beating up the National Son.

367
00:25:07,118 --> 00:25:08,388
给我一个直接的回答。
Give me a straight answer.

368
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,557
否则，我就敲碎你的脑袋，然后进监狱。
Otherwise, I'll crack your skull and go to jail.

369
00:25:11,757 --> 00:25:12,828
你知道我的愿望是什么。
You know what my wish is.

370
00:25:14,828 --> 00:25:16,598
你也杀了奉仪的奶奶，对吧?
You killed Bong Yi's grandma too, didn't you?

371
00:25:16,727 --> 00:25:19,467
因为只有你，警监和我
The reason you, captain, and I were the only ones...

372
00:25:19,527 --> 00:25:22,898
进入物证室的录音是因为你是凶手，
recorded entering the evidence room was because you were the killer,

373
00:25:23,037 --> 00:25:25,237
不是因为凶手避开了摄像头。
not because the killer avoided the camera somehow.

374
00:25:25,307 --> 00:25:26,737
你拿了奉仪给我的钱让我杀了他。
You took the money Bong Yi gave me to kill him.

375
00:25:26,737 --> 00:25:29,007
只有你和申警探知道账单背后的故事。
Only you and Detective Shin know the story behind that bill.

376
00:25:29,207 --> 00:25:31,207
你把它。要杀他。对吧?
You took it. To kill him. Right?

377
00:25:33,047 --> 00:25:34,517
现在一切都说得通了。
Everything makes sense now.

378
00:25:35,848 --> 00:25:36,987
回答我,混蛋。
Answer me, jerk.

379
00:25:39,787 --> 00:25:40,858
你是对的。
You're right.

380
00:25:42,318 --> 00:25:43,428
我杀了他。
I killed him.

381
00:25:44,928 --> 00:25:45,928
什么?
What?

382
00:25:46,828 --> 00:25:48,428
我拿起奶奶的小刀……
I took Granny's knife...

383
00:25:50,197 --> 00:25:51,767
把它放回去……
and put it back...

384
00:25:53,967 --> 00:25:54,997
也
as well.

385
00:26:00,277 --> 00:26:01,438
邦依有危险。
Bong Yi was in danger.

386
00:26:03,378 --> 00:26:04,707
我以为他要杀了她，
I thought he was going to kill her,

387
00:26:07,178 --> 00:26:08,547
所以我先杀了他
so I killed him first.

388
00:26:13,517 --> 00:26:14,787
邦伊知道吗?
Does Bong Yi know?

389
00:26:16,388 --> 00:26:17,487
所以我们分手了。
That's why we broke up.

390
00:26:20,027 --> 00:26:21,527
她说她不介意
She says she's fine with it,

391
00:26:23,928 --> 00:26:25,297
但我无法忍受那种负罪感。
but I couldn't bear the guilt.

392
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:34,707
但是关于李在植和金秉泰，
But regarding Lee Jae Shik and Kim Byung Tae,

393
00:26:35,977 --> 00:26:38,007
我不知道你看到了什么，但是…
I don't know what you saw, but...

394
00:26:39,378 --> 00:26:40,447
告诉我。
Tell me.

395
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:43,787
你为什么在李在植被释放那天去监狱?
Why did you go to the prison the day Lee Jae Shik was released?

396
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,618
我肯定被那里的摄像头拍到了。
I must've been caught on camera there.

397
00:26:50,727 --> 00:26:52,487
我接到了崔女士的电话。
I got a call from Ms. Choi.

398
00:26:53,457 --> 00:26:55,297
-从Hong Ju?——是的。
- From Hong Ju? - Yes.

399
00:26:57,128 --> 00:26:58,967
她要董古的电话号码。
She asked for Dong Koo's number.

400
00:26:59,527 --> 00:27:02,467
她说她认为李在植是凶手。
She said she thought Lee Jae Shik was the murderer.

401
00:27:03,908 --> 00:27:06,168
她说想核实一下，我就告诉她了。
She said she wanted to check, so I told her.

402
00:27:07,378 --> 00:27:10,447
但如果这是真的，说明他很危险。
But if that's true, it meant he was dangerous.

403
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:14,277
这就是我去的原因。因为我很担心。
That's why I went. Because I was worried.

404
00:27:16,918 --> 00:27:18,047
那金秉泰呢?
What about Kim Byung Tae?

405
00:27:18,688 --> 00:27:20,118
你为什么去他家?
Why did you go to his home?

406
00:27:21,287 --> 00:27:23,487
我进出那里的时候肯定被摄像头拍到了。
I must've been caught on camera going in or out of there.

407
00:27:23,858 --> 00:27:26,658
当我在自助餐厅遇到那位奶奶时，
When I met that grandma in the cafeteria,

408
00:27:27,828 --> 00:27:30,467
她说他往孩子头上倒了些东西。
she said he poured something on the child's head.

409
00:27:31,128 --> 00:27:33,267
我没多想，也没在意，
I didn't think much of it and ignored it,

410
00:27:34,197 --> 00:27:35,598
但它一直困扰着我。
but it kept nagging at me.

411
00:27:36,507 --> 00:27:38,438
所以我偷偷溜进了他家。
So I sneaked into his home.

412
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:42,078
我知道这样不对，但我还是离开了，因为我什么都没找到。
I knew it was wrong, but I just left because I didn't find anything.

413
00:27:46,777 --> 00:27:48,047
我会为杀人付出代价…
I'll pay for killing...

414
00:27:49,777 --> 00:27:50,787
康duke energy秀
Kang Duk Soo

415
00:27:51,818 --> 00:27:53,148
我是想说的，但是…
I was going to, but...

416
00:27:55,188 --> 00:27:57,088
除非我抓到杀奇库克的凶手。
not until I catch Chi Kook's killer.

417
00:27:58,128 --> 00:27:59,928
请给我截止时间。
Please give me until then.

418
00:28:01,128 --> 00:28:02,128
好吗?
Please?

419
00:28:06,598 --> 00:28:08,838
你怎么解释?
How can you explain that?

420
00:28:09,267 --> 00:28:10,938
那个用卡车挡住我的奥兹人
The OZ guy who blocked me with his truck...

421
00:28:11,168 --> 00:28:13,168
当时我正要去救奉仪
when I was on my way to save Bong Yi.

422
00:28:13,537 --> 00:28:14,878
跟踪你的那个人。
The guy who was tailing you.

423
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:17,408
我不知道。我也快疯了。
I don't know. That's driving me crazy too.

424
00:28:18,908 --> 00:28:20,578
我不知道他们是谁。
I don't know who they are.

425
00:28:22,017 --> 00:28:24,787
这是怎么呢他在骗我吗?
What's going on? Is he lying to me?

426
00:28:26,017 --> 00:28:27,158
还是真的有人……
Or is there really someone...

427
00:28:27,158 --> 00:28:29,257
谁想把他的罪行揽到自己头上?
who's trying to take credit for his crimes?

428
00:28:29,557 --> 00:28:31,828
你说我帮他收拾是什么意思?
What do you mean I cleaned up after him?

429
00:28:32,158 --> 00:28:36,027
正确的。看起来他确实不知道李警探的事。
Right. It did seem like he had no idea about Detective Lee.

430
00:28:36,428 --> 00:28:37,428
请。
Please.

431
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:40,098
直到我抓到杀害奇果的凶手。
Just until I catch those who killed Chi Kook.

432
00:28:42,068 --> 00:28:43,967
给我时间。
Give me until then.

433
00:28:44,507 --> 00:28:46,207
一旦找到，我就去自首。
Once I do, I'll turn myself in.

434
00:28:48,737 --> 00:28:50,108
求你了，我求求你了。
Please, I'm begging you.

435
00:29:06,227 --> 00:29:07,296
侦探柯,
Detective Ko,

436
00:29:08,626 --> 00:29:11,197
我知道我现在厚颜无耻，两面派。
I know I'm being brazen and two-faced.

437
00:29:12,697 --> 00:29:14,167
但再给我一点时间。
But give me a little more time.

438
00:29:15,207 --> 00:29:16,566
一旦我抓到他们，
Once I catch them,

439
00:29:18,477 --> 00:29:20,076
我会受到无尽的惩罚。
I'll receive my endless punishment.

440
00:29:29,647 --> 00:29:31,356
我还得检查一下。
I should still check.

441
00:29:53,576 --> 00:29:54,606
官荣格?
Officer Jung?

442
00:29:57,147 --> 00:29:59,247
是的，我打电话问他释放的时间。
Yes, I called to ask him about the time of release.

443
00:30:00,546 --> 00:30:01,616
你为什么这么问?
Why do you ask?

444
00:30:02,447 --> 00:30:05,116
什么?嗯…
What? Well...

445
00:30:06,826 --> 00:30:09,126
还有什么?你还跟他说了什么?
What else? What else did you tell him?

446
00:30:13,467 --> 00:30:15,497
Suseong系列谋杀案背后真正的罪犯…
That the real culprit behind the Suseong serial murders...

451
00:30:26,677 --> 00:30:28,477
你应该来找我，而不是他。

我们有她的联系电话，对吧?

给她打个电话，护送她妈妈去见她。

所以我们分手了。
That's why we broke up.

481
00:31:57,336 --> 00:31:58,866
她说她不介意
She says she's fine with it,

482
00:32:01,207 --> 00:32:02,707

but I couldn't bear the guilt.

483
00:32:04,237 --> 00:32:05,306
就是这个地方。
This is the place.

Why did Officer Jung dump you?

508
00:33:25,487 --> 00:33:27,657
嗯,你知道的。
Well, you know.

509
00:33:27,826 --> 00:33:29,657
反正我们也不是真的约会过。
It's not like we actually dated anyway.

不管怎样，你为什么要用Ba Reum…
Anyway, why did you punch Ba Reum...

513
00:33:48,646 --> 00:33:49,947

顺便问一下，你之前为什么来车站?

什么?
What?

529

我自己证实了。
I confirmed it myself.

530
00:34:48,537 --> 00:34:49,737
这就是宋佑翰。
It was Sung Yo Han.

精神病患者是众所周知的演员。

00:35:02,987 --> 00:35:05,086
他装模作样，让自己看起来像个天真的孩子。
He put on a show to look like an innocent boy.

534
00:35:05,356 --> 00:35:07,226
-那是演戏。——没有。
- It was an act. - No.

535
00:35:07,427 --> 00:35:08,856
他不是假装。
He wasn't pretending.

536
00:35:09,186 --> 00:35:10,427
他真的很担心。
He was genuinely worried.

537

当他背着我的时候，
When he carried me on his back,

538
00:35:14,026 --> 00:35:15,526
我是无意识的。
I was unconscious.

539
00:35:16,226 --> 00:35:18,867
然而，有那么几秒钟，我短暂地意识到了。
However, for a few seconds, I was briefly conscious.

00:35:19,197 --> 00:35:21,537
就在那时，我听到了他绝望的话语。

他为什么要假装…
Why would he put on an act...

545
00:35:35,887 --> 00:35:38,086
对于一个昏迷的人来说?
for someone who was unconscious?

546
00:35:38,287 --> 00:35:40,487
他显然是发自内心的。
He was obviously speaking from the heart.

547
00:35:41,257 --> 00:35:43,327
但精神变态者会这样吗?
But can a psychopath be like that?

548
00:35:43,327 --> 00:35:45,026
你觉得这说得通吗?
Does this make any sense to you?

What if...

It means someone else killed them both.

00:54:49,496 --> 00:54:50,825
我想哭。
I want to cry.

751
00:54:52,095 --> 00:54:53,566
我想要得到安慰。
I want to be comforted.

752
00:54:57,195 --> 00:54:58,905
但是这里一个人也没有。没有人在我身边。
But there's no one here. No one is by my side.

753
00:55:02,376 --> 00:55:03,405
我很害怕。
I'm scared.

754
00:55:05,206 --> 00:55:06,706
我很害怕，在熙。
I'm scared, Jae Hee.

755
00:55:06,805 --> 00:55:08,416
Sung Yo Han哭了?
Sung Yo Han cried?

756
00:55:15,016 --> 00:55:18,286
还有什么?他还说了什么?
What else? What else did he say?

757
00:55:19,325 --> 00:55:21,726
Jae胡恩。Jae胡恩。
Jae Hoon. Jae Hoon.

758
00:55:22,856 --> 00:55:23,956
Jae胡恩吗?
Jae Hoon?

759
00:55:26,595 --> 00:55:27,996
他提到了我?
He talked about me?

760
00:55:28,436 --> 00:55:31,865
——这就是他。——多么可怕。
- That's him. - How scary.

761
00:55:41,246 --> 00:55:44,746
“大家都怕他，躲着他。”
"Everyone feared him and avoided him."

762
00:55:45,586 --> 00:55:47,516
-别这样，董koo。——下车!
- Stop that, Dong Koo. - Get off!

763
00:55:50,416 --> 00:55:53,325
“在那短暂的一刻，”
"In that brief moment,"

764
00:55:53,555 --> 00:55:56,896
“我看到了那个男孩15年前的眼神。”
"I saw that boy's eyes from 15 years ago."

765
00:56:01,796 --> 00:56:02,836
这是一次突然袭击。
It was a surprise attack.

766
00:56:03,666 --> 00:56:06,305
他会本能地举手辩护。
He would've instinctively raised his hands in defense.

767
00:56:06,305 --> 00:56:08,036
他的手指上有防卫伤。
The defense wounds are on his fingers.

768
00:56:08,036 --> 00:56:10,376
也就是说他还没来得及举手就被袭击了。
That means he was attacked before he could raise his hands.

769
00:56:11,546 --> 00:56:13,575
如果是在他举手之前，
If it was before he could raise his hands,

770
00:56:14,405 --> 00:56:16,575
是一个跟他很亲近的人。
it was someone very close to him.

771
00:56:17,445 --> 00:56:20,916
嗯…是一个追随韩秀俊的囚犯。
Well... It was one of the inmates who follow Han Seo Joon.

772
00:56:21,215 --> 00:56:23,055
他承认他这么做是为了给奇果一个教训……
He confessed that he did it to teach Chi Kook a lesson...

773
00:56:23,055 --> 00:56:24,516
不尊重猎头
for disrespecting the Head Hunter.

774
00:56:25,425 --> 00:56:27,086
和他最亲近的人。
Someone closest to him.

775
00:56:28,195 --> 00:56:30,555
到底是那个男孩吗?
Was it that boy after all?

776
00:56:30,655 --> 00:56:34,025
我想和你谈谈最近的谋杀案。
I'd like to talk to you regarding the recent murders.

777
00:56:34,566 --> 00:56:35,936
这跟我有什么关系?
What does that have to do with me?

778
00:56:36,195 --> 00:56:38,266
我知道是谁干的。
I know who did it.

779
00:56:38,666 --> 00:56:39,865
他是非常危险的。
He's very dangerous.

780
00:56:42,905 --> 00:56:44,505
我想知道……
I wanted to find out...

781
00:56:45,845 --> 00:56:47,075
如果真的是那个男孩。
if it really was that boy.

782
00:56:55,086 --> 00:56:57,686
如果他哭的时候不是在演戏呢?
What if he wasn't acting when he cried...

783
00:56:58,555 --> 00:57:00,055
拥抱红菊的时候?
while hugging Hong Ju?

784
00:57:01,925 --> 00:57:03,226
如果是真心的呢?
What if it was sincere?

785
00:57:08,566 --> 00:57:10,135
你在想什么，妈妈?
What are you thinking about, Mom?

786
00:57:13,005 --> 00:57:16,075
你看起来总是很悲伤，无论你什么时候……
You always look sad whenever you look...

787
00:57:16,505 --> 00:57:18,305
在阳光下。
at the sunlight.

788
00:57:18,905 --> 00:57:20,405
正因为如此，
And because of that,

789
00:57:20,945 --> 00:57:23,175
每当我看到阳光，我也会难过。
I'm sad whenever I see the sunlight too.

790
00:57:29,193 --> 00:57:30,392
无稽之谈。
Nonsense.

791
00:57:31,493 --> 00:57:32,962
我一点也不难过。
I'm not sad at all.

792
00:57:34,432 --> 00:57:37,403
有你在身边，我为什么要生气?
Why would I be when I have you beside me?

793
00:57:39,602 --> 00:57:41,343
4440号囚犯的访客。
The visitor for Inmate 4440.

794
00:57:43,272 --> 00:57:44,542
他拒绝见你。
He refused to see you.

795
00:57:45,343 --> 00:57:48,613
只是我真的必须和他谈谈。
It's just that I really must talk to him.

796
00:57:49,082 --> 00:57:51,113
请再问他一次。
Please ask him once more.

797
00:57:51,383 --> 00:57:54,953
犯人拒绝探访我们也无能为力。
There's nothing we can do when an inmate rejects the visitor.

798
00:57:55,022 --> 00:57:57,993
——请。请再问他一遍。——我很抱歉。
- Please. Please ask him again. - I'm sorry.

799
00:57:58,723 --> 00:57:59,792
然后……
Then...

800
00:58:03,622 --> 00:58:07,193
告诉他是关于他儿子，韩友。
Tell him that it's about his son, Yo Han.

801
00:58:08,133 --> 00:58:09,932
“我简直不敢相信……”
"I couldn't believe..."

802
00:58:10,232 --> 00:58:12,102
"丹尼尔·李告诉我的"
"what Daniel Lee told me,"

803
00:58:13,303 --> 00:58:16,743
“所以我问Joon Sung谁在那里工作……”
"so I asked Joon Sung who worked there..."

804
00:58:17,042 --> 00:58:19,613
我让他去调查财务三队。
I asked him to look into Finance Team Three.

805
00:58:19,973 --> 00:58:21,883
——为什么?-去检查一些东西。
- What for? - To check something.

806
00:58:23,343 --> 00:58:26,013
我需要确认这是否属实。
I need to confirm if it's true.

807
00:58:27,923 --> 00:58:29,122
财务团队三个?
Finance Team Three?

808
00:58:29,723 --> 00:58:31,022
有三队吗?
Is there a team three?

809
00:58:35,122 --> 00:58:36,292
是这个部门的吗?
Is it under this department?

(财务部)
(Finance Department)

811
00:58:37,962 --> 00:58:40,392
我会深入调查的。你知道我的黑客技术。
I'll look deeper into it. You know my hacking skills.

812
00:58:42,763 --> 00:58:44,562
这就是为什么金俊成…
That's why Kim Joon Sung...

813
00:58:44,832 --> 00:58:46,372
Yo Han，我是Joon Sung。
Yo Han, it's Joon Sung.

814
00:58:46,533 --> 00:58:47,803
那个声音信息。
That voice message.

815
00:58:47,872 --> 00:58:51,203
你让我调查的事让我很害怕。
What you asked me to look into has me terrified.

816
00:58:51,412 --> 00:58:53,042
也许黑客不是个好主意。
Maybe hacking wasn't the right idea.

817
00:58:53,943 --> 00:58:55,343
这个组织被称为“OZ”。
The organization goes by the name "OZ".

(January 1995, Subject B: Park Jae Hoon)

821
00:59:35,953 --> 00:59:37,823
李医生说的是实话。
Dr. Lee was telling the truth.

822
00:59:42,493 --> 00:59:43,723
这是令人作呕。
This is sickening.

823
00:59:44,993 --> 00:59:45,993
如何……
How...

824
00:59:46,832 --> 00:59:48,263
怎么会有人做这些事?
How could someone do all this?

825
00:59:49,133 --> 00:59:50,732
凶手是个精神病患者。
The killer is a psychopath.

826
00:59:51,533 --> 00:59:54,073
他没有道德准则。
He doesn't have a moral compass.

827
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:01,013
现在该做什么?
What now?

828
01:00:02,912 --> 01:00:03,943
我得等等……
I'll have to wait...

829
01:00:04,852 --> 01:00:06,113
直到他恢复知觉。
until he regains consciousness.

830
01:00:06,953 --> 01:00:08,923
为什么不把这一切都报道出来?
Why not just report this whole thing?

831
01:00:09,053 --> 01:00:10,182
我怎么能相信警察呢?
How can I trust the cops?

832
01:00:11,053 --> 01:00:12,752
如果我们利用媒体公开呢?
What if we use the media to go public?

833
01:00:12,823 --> 01:00:14,252
我们面对的是一个秘密行动。
We're up against a black operation.

834
01:00:14,323 --> 01:00:16,823
说出来会害死我们的
Running our mouths about it could lead us to our deaths.

835
01:00:18,232 --> 01:00:20,363
我们无法知道这个程序有多深入。
There's no way to know how deep this program runs.

836
01:00:20,693 --> 01:00:21,732
那我们该怎么办呢?
What can we do then?

837
01:00:22,403 --> 01:00:25,403
我们等李医生醒了再说。
Let's wait until Dr. Lee awakes.

838
01:00:29,872 --> 01:00:30,872
我很害怕。
I'm scared.

839
01:00:31,573 --> 01:00:32,642
韩哟
Yo Han,

840
01:00:33,372 --> 01:00:35,912
如果他们发现我黑了系统怎么办?
what if they find out that I hacked into the system?

841
01:00:36,082 --> 01:00:38,783
暂时离开这个国家。
Leave the country for the time being.

842
01:00:39,352 --> 01:00:41,312
-你呢?-一旦李医生醒来
- What about you? - Once Dr. Lee wakes up,

843
01:00:41,383 --> 01:00:43,022
我们将一起操作。
we'll operate together.

844
01:00:43,883 --> 01:00:46,323
别担心。他马上就起来。
Don't worry. He'll be up soon.

845
01:00:59,932 --> 01:01:02,002
如果她向警方告发我，她就有危险了。
If she reports me to the police, it'll put her in danger.

846
01:01:06,912 --> 01:01:08,412
我确定她就是在这里下车的。
I'm sure this is where she got off.

847
01:01:10,712 --> 01:01:11,783
Gudong吗?
Gudong?

848
01:01:12,982 --> 01:01:14,823
那是容巴留姆居住的地方。
It's where Jung Ba Reum lives.

849
01:01:15,352 --> 01:01:18,022
如果她告诉他了呢?容巴容不能知道。
What if she tells him? Jung Ba Reum must not know.

850
01:01:52,723 --> 01:01:56,223
要是那晚我没穿俊成的夹克就好了。
If only I hadn't worn Joon Sung's jacket that night.

851
01:01:58,432 --> 01:02:00,292
他是我唯一的朋友。
He had been my only friend.

852
01:02:01,533 --> 01:02:04,102
其他人指责我是亨特猎头的儿子，
Others pointed their fingers at me for being Head Hunter's son,

853
01:02:05,102 --> 01:02:07,173
但俊成总是站在我这边。
but Joon Sung always took my side.

854
01:02:09,303 --> 01:02:10,903
但因为我…
But because of me...

855
01:02:12,712 --> 01:02:14,712
我要亲手杀了容巴容。
I'll kill Jung Ba Reum myself.

856
01:02:19,412 --> 01:02:21,553
所以他在他家放了我的照片。
That's why he had photos of me at his house.

857
01:02:45,513 --> 01:02:48,513
为什么宋友韩把巴留的照片挂在墙上?
Why did Sung Yo Han have Ba Reum's photos on his wall?

858
01:03:11,602 --> 01:03:13,533
我们刚拿到搜查令。
We just got a search warrant.

859
01:03:13,973 --> 01:03:15,002
搜查令?
A search warrant?

860
01:03:24,883 --> 01:03:27,053
李医生，你没事吧?
Dr. Lee, are you all right?

861
01:03:54,042 --> 01:03:56,682
如果韩果那天不在车里…
If Han Kook wasn't in his car that day...

862
01:04:00,383 --> 01:04:02,352
我们在他车里发现了谁的血迹?
Whose blood did we find in his car?

863
01:04:19,872 --> 01:04:21,033
会是谁呢?
Who could it have been?

01:04:38,752 --> 01:04:40,223
留在这个世界上。
left in this world now.

868
01:04:41,323 --> 01:04:42,363
什么?
What?

869
01:05:05,013 --> 01:05:06,212
我越想越觉得
The more I think about it,

870
01:05:06,212 --> 01:05:07,712
我就更确定那不是Sung Yo Han。
the more I'm sure it's not Sung Yo Han.

871
01:05:08,682 --> 01:05:10,323
但没办法证实我的怀疑。
But there's no way to confirm my suspicions.

872
01:05:12,153 --> 01:05:13,223
该死的,这很伤我的心。
Darn, that hurts.

873
01:05:23,863 --> 01:05:25,903
这是正确的。我割破了他的胳膊。
That's right. I slit his arm.

874
01:06:25,562 --> 01:06:27,162
只有腹部中枪。
Nothing other than a gunshot to the abdomen.

875
01:06:27,593 --> 01:06:30,562
他左臂上一定有个伤疤。
He must have a scar on his left arm.

876
01:06:30,863 --> 01:06:33,332
刀伤被刀刺伤的人对这里。
One inflicted by a knife. Right about here.

877
01:06:34,973 --> 01:06:36,602
他胳膊上什么都没有。
There's nothing on his arm.

878
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:39,243
——真的吗?你确定吗?-你自己看吧。
- Really? Are you sure? - See for yourself.

879
01:06:39,312 --> 01:06:40,312
什么都有。
Nothing's there.

880
01:06:41,543 --> 01:06:43,943
那为什么Sung Yo Han是嫌疑人?
Then why was Sung Yo Han a suspect?

881
01:06:44,012 --> 01:06:45,653
我清楚地告诉过你发生了什么。
I clearly told you what happened.

882
01:06:46,083 --> 01:06:48,482
你在说什么?看。
What are you talking about? Look.

883
01:06:50,653 --> 01:06:52,493
你的口供里没有。
It's not in the statement you gave.

884
01:06:53,653 --> 01:06:54,953
什么?这是奇怪的。
What? That's odd.

885
01:06:55,623 --> 01:06:57,123
我说得很清楚。
I clearly said it.

886
01:06:57,562 --> 01:06:58,693
等待。
Wait.

887
01:06:59,793 --> 01:07:02,302
我想我的刀割破了他的胳膊。
I think I cut his arm with my knife.

888
01:07:03,333 --> 01:07:05,432
——你做了吗?——左侧。
- You did? - Left side.

889
01:07:06,403 --> 01:07:07,573
我觉得是他的左臂。
I think it was his left arm.

890
01:07:07,632 --> 01:07:10,003
好吧。我会告诉康警探的。
Okay. I'll tell Detective Kang.

891
01:07:10,302 --> 01:07:12,073
你跟谁说的?你确定吗?
Who did you tell this? Are you sure?

892
01:07:12,243 --> 01:07:13,713
那么是谁没有上报呢?
Who failed to report it then?

893
01:07:14,812 --> 01:07:16,982
你确定你割伤了袭击者的手臂吗?
Are you sure you cut your attacker's arm?

894
01:07:18,653 --> 01:07:19,913
哦,好吧…
Oh, well...

895
01:07:20,953 --> 01:07:22,783
我想我错了。
I guess I was mistaken.

896
01:07:24,583 --> 01:07:28,153
我检查了几件东西后再打给你。
I'll get back to you after I check a few things.

897
01:07:28,153 --> 01:07:29,193
好吧。
Okay.

898
01:07:36,633 --> 01:07:38,474
他忘记转达口信了吗?
Did he forget to relay the message?

成友韩来取韩秀俊的血。
Sung Yo Han came to collect Han Seo Joon's blood.

902
01:07:57,194 --> 01:07:58,623
他不是来杀娜奇果的。
He wasn't here to kill Na Chi Kook.

903
01:07:59,163 --> 01:08:00,394
如果不是Sung Yo Han呢?
What if it wasn't Sung Yo Han?

904
01:08:03,034 --> 01:08:04,093
那是谁呢?
Then who could it be?

我们一起把箱子搬到了礼堂。
We carried the box to the auditorium together.

-我们聊天道别。——祝你好运。不要让害怕。
- We chatted and said goodbye. - Good luck. Don't get intimidated.

908
01:08:11,373 --> 01:08:13,003
——好吧,再见。-在我看到奇果离开后
- Okay, bye. - After I saw Chi Kook leave,

909
01:08:13,303 --> 01:08:15,203
我把盒子推了进去。
I pushed the box inside.

910
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:18,913
凶手是如何移动一个昏迷的成年人的…
How did the killer manage to move a grown, unconscious man...

911
01:08:19,644 --> 01:08:21,953
一直到礼堂里的魔盒吗?
all the way to the magic box in the auditorium?

912
01:08:42,503 --> 01:08:43,604
原谅我。
Excuse me.

913
01:08:45,774 --> 01:08:48,474
犯人4440刚刚同意见你。

Ba Reum.

915
01:09:06,593 --> 01:09:09,463
巴·雷姆，我有事要问你。
Ba Reum, I have something to ask.

916
01:09:17,604 --> 01:09:19,303
他看起来很疲惫。
He looks so exhausted.

917
01:10:30,673 --> 01:10:33,144
如果魔盒就在这里呢?
What if the magic box was here?

918
01:10:34,484 --> 01:10:36,684
如果这就是凶手把尸体放进去的地方呢?
What if this was where the killer put the body inside?

919
01:10:39,654 --> 01:10:42,453
在盒子里面，有一面斜着放的镜子。
Inside the box, there's a mirror placed diagonally.

920
01:10:42,654 --> 01:10:45,053
你让那个人走进镜子里。
You make the person go inside the mirror.

921
01:10:45,053 --> 01:10:46,963
我把它带进来的时候就落在这里了……
I left it here once I brought it in...

922
01:10:47,024 --> 01:10:48,764
这样就不会妨碍别人了。
so it wouldn't get in people's ways.

923
01:10:48,764 --> 01:10:51,434
我离开去吃午饭了。
I stepped away for lunch.

924

我只知道巴·雷姆告诉我的。
I only know what Ba Reum told me.

925
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:56,003
如果他骗了我怎么办?
What if he lied to me?

926
01:10:57,604 --> 01:10:59,003
但他为什么要撒谎?
But why would he lie?

927
01:10:59,003 --> 01:11:00,343
他没有理由撒谎。
He has no reason to lie.

928
01:11:27,133 --> 01:11:28,833
如果是巴雷姆呢?
What if it was Ba Reum?

929
01:12:15,243 --> 01:12:17,583
(老鼠)
(Mouse)

930
01:12:17,883 --> 01:12:20,224
他辞职了吗?通过电子邮件吗?

01:12:20,324 --> 01:12:22,793
每一秒都追踪巴留姆的下落。

01:12:23,923 --> 01:12:26,593
我会用最残忍的方式杀了你。
I'll kill you using the worst way possible.

934
01:12:26,864 --> 01:12:28,064
你只是等待。
You just wait.

935
01:12:28,423 --> 01:12:30,093
会比你想象的要多。
It'll be more than what you can imagine.

936
01:12:30,934 --> 01:12:33,133
英航Reum !
Ba Reum!

937
01:12:33,503 --> 01:12:35,404
你去报警了吗?
By any chance, did you go to the police?

938
01:12:35,503 --> 01:12:37,133
我要你追踪这个人。
I want you to trace this person.

939
01:12:37,133 --> 01:12:39,373
我会让一切恢复正常。
I'll put everything back to normal.

940
01:12:39,673 --> 01:12:42,003
金俊成说他黑了财务三队的系统。
Kim Joon Sung said he hacked Finance Team Three's system.

941
01:12:49,413 --> 01:12:51,784
我不会让你死的。
I'm not going to let you die.

942
01:12:52,324 --> 01:12:55,484
先生，我真的想吃鸡肉。
Sir, I really want to eat chicken.

943
01:12:55,694 --> 01:12:56,894
天啊，算了吧。
My gosh, forget it.

944
01:13:03,064 --> 01:13:04,133
