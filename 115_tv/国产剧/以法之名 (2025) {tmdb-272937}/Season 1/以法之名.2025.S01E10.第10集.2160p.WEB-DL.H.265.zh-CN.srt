1
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,840
David.

2
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,120
David.

3
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,560
- David.
- Jesus!

4
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,520
What's the matter,david?

5
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,400
Where's ellen?

6
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,160
I'm right here.

7
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,360
Ellen!

8
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,800
Ellen.

9
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,160
Hey. What's wrong?

10
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,920
I could get used to this.

11
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,360
What are you doing with her?

12
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,680
What do you mean?

13
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,320
Look,I like her.

14
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,520
I-I... she's smart,capable,but...

15
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,480
come on... she's not
your type of lawyer.

16
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,600
How long you going to keep her around?

17
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,640
Ellen brought us katie,katie
brought us gregory.

18
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,280
Right.

19
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,040
So as long as gregory's
still in play,so is ellen.

20
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,360
Simple as that.

21
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,360
Hey.

22
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,160
- It's katie.
- Oh,yeah?

23
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,640
What's the matter?

24
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,520
Gregory malina's dead.

28
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,760
Patty was at the beach house.

29
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,400
What did you tell her?

30
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,560
She was there.

31
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,560
By the time I showed up,she was gone.

32
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,600
Looks like she left in a hurry.

33
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,000
Look,ellen,I want to help you.

34
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,000
I want to get you out of here.

35
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,360
But I don't know what
to believe anymore.

36
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,360
Someone tried to kill me,tom.

37
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,600
It was a
hit-and-run.

38
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,800
Gregory malina died at the scene.

39
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,240
1 MONTH EARLIER

40
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,960
So we move on...

41
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,160
to frobisher's deposition.

42
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,760
Here's the game plan
with one major addition.

43
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,920
Ellen.

44
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:01,760
Arlington,virginia,1983,frobisher's
jaguar crashes,killing the girl he's with.

45
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,680
Frobisher denies he was driving,but
he was drunk at the time.

46
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,160
He's never charged,so
there's no wrongful death suit

47
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,400
but last week,we received a tip that

48
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,040
frobisher gave the girl's
parents stock in his company.

49
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,400
It's hush money,so we're going to use it to
show frobisher's history of obstructing justice.

50
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:26,280
If we can crack his slick facade in the
deposition and get him to show his true colors,

51
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,320
it'll be a victory.

52
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,400
Thanks,everyone.

53
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,640
Thank you.

54
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,240
Hey,there she is.

55
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,440
Do you really have to go,dad?

56
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,000
Yeah,I'm afraid so.

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,080
Daddy's lawyer's helping him prepare.

58
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,560
This way he can focus better,not
be distracted by all of us.

59
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,200
Hey,mohammed ali used to hole
up for six weeks before a fight.

60
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,080
Who's that?

61
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,160
Greatest fighter of all times after me.

62
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,280
Oh,I'm not going to have
time to do that,sweetheart.

63
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,880
Thought you could use this.

64
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,240
Look at you.

65
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,680
What's that for?

66
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,560
The night before your
stepmom and I got married,

67
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,240
I was staying in a hotel
room nervous as shit.

68
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,040
Dad!

69
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,600
You're old enough.

70
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,680
Anyway,I was cooped up,sweating
bullets and holly sent me my three iron.

71
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,960
Why?

72
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,400
It's your dad's good luck charm.

73
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,480
You're my good luck charm now.

74
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
What are you doing?

75
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,400
Come on,it's just another deposition.

76
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,480
Everything's going to be okay.

77
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,280
We're going to be fine,trust me.

78
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,600
How ugly is this going to get?

79
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,680
We're reasonable people.

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,480
Yes,we are.

81
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,720
No video camera.

82
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,600
- Unreasonable.
- Patty...

83
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,240
What are you worried about?

84
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,880
Your client is a matinee idol.

85
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,560
Unless his herpes has
flared up,he'll be just fine.

86
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,480
Nonnegotiable.

87
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,280
- I'll give you home- court
advantage. - Not interested.

88
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,960
But since we're on the topic...

89
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,040
how many sessions?

90
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,080
- Seven.
- Two.

91
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,400
Five.

92
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,680
I have a lot of questions.

93
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,760
That's what wikipedia is for.

94
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,520
Okay,three.

95
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,280
But I get the video camera.

96
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,880
That's a big concession.

97
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,600
So is three days.

98
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,440
Deal.

99
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,200
Gregory malina's dead.

100
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,800
Oh,my.

101
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,200
Hit-and-run.

102
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,160
That's horrible.

103
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,840
I guess we'll never know
what really happened.

104
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,760
Maybe the police will find the guy.

105
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,920
I won't hold my breath.

106
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,520
And,uh,ray...

107
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,680
shame on you.

108
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,200
What's the matter with you,ray?
You look a little green.

109
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,840
Listen,I got it down to three
days,but she's going to have a camera.

110
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,120
That's okay,right?
We've prepared,I'm ready.

111
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,320
Yeah,but,art,listen...

112
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,000
What?

113
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,840
You're going into this
deposition exposed.

114
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,720
How so?

115
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,200
Well,I don't know what to do about
this arlington business,I'm sorry.

116
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,760
She's going to attack you with it and
there's no clear way i can see to stop her.

117
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,680
I'm not settling,ray.

118
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,960
Well,I don't know how to protect you.

119
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,640
I'll just have to protect
myself then,won't I?

120
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,320
How are you going to do that?

121
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,640
You wanted to see me?

122
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,840
How was the beach house?

123
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,800
Amazing. I've been meaning to thank
you all day,but it's been so busy.

124
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,120
David and I would love to
take you and phil to dinner.

125
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,240
Oh,forget the dinner,ellen.

126
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,320
I've decided to take
you off the deposition.

127
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,840
I would like you to report to felicia.

128
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,240
She needs some work done on
a pro bono she's heading up.

129
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,200
Vacation's over.

130
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,160
Get back to work.

131
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,960
Yeah,I'll do that.

132
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,080
What are you doing?

133
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,480
Patty's making me do all
this paralegal bullshit.

134
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,760
For the deposition?

135
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,480
No,it has absolutely nothing
to do with the deposition.

136
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,720
Then put that shit away,huh

137
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,840
Oh,wait,wait,wait,wait,wait,wait.

138
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,840
In 1983,shortly after the tragedy
of their daughter,cindy's,death,

139
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,080
I gave the lambert family
stock in my company.

140
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,160
Holy shit.

141
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,880
Now,there's some people who might think
that that act was a sign of guilt...

142
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,720
or worse,an attempt to obfuscate a crime
and to buy the lambert family's silence.

143
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,760
To respond to that,I'm going to turn
this part over to cindy's father,carl.

144
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,040
Thank you,arthur.

145
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,320
Uh,folks,for my wife and I,the
particulars of this tragedy were

146
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,080
put to rest almost three decades ago.

147
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,840
Now this is the police
report from the accident.

148
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:59,200
It documents the angle of impact and the numerous
injuries sustained by both cindy and arthur.

149
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,520
Now,this report
convinced us at that time,

150
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,000
and we remain convinced,that our
daughter was driving that car.

151
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,920
Unbelievable.

152
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,560
Arthur frobisher provided financial support
to my family because he loved my daughter.

153
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,480
The fact that it wasn't
made public is to his credit.

154
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,280
Character is what you do in the dark.

155
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,680
Isn't that what christ teaches us?

156
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,040
- Oh,jesus.
- Thank you,carl.

157
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,840
And thank all of you for coming today.

158
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,720
Um,I just want to say I'm relieved and grateful
that this issue can finally be put to rest.

159
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,200
1 MONTH LATER

160
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,400
I don't know what to believe anymore.

161
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,440
Someone tried to kill me,tom.

162
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,640
Come on,ellen.

163
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,760
When I left patty's
apartment,there was a dead body.

164
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,640
There was blood on the
floor,a window had been broken.

165
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,600
You've got to go there.

166
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,520
You've got to go to patty's apartment.

167
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,040
The police didn't find anything!

168
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,600
Then someone's covering it up!

169
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,400
Look,without any evidence,what can I do?

170
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,880
Let's go,parsons.

171
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,840
Get me bail. I'll do the rest myself.

172
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,240
Patty?

173
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,720
okay,boy,okay.

174
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,040
There's a good boy.

175
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,000
Yeah,good boy.

176
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,840
Patty?

177
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,880
We were set up.

178
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,840
Or there's a leak in the office.

179
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,880
I don't want anyone in
the deposition but you,tom.

180
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,160
We're going into lockdown.

181
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,520
Miss hewes,I'd like to meet
with mr.Moore and question him.

182
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,480
No.

183
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,200
He could be the source of the leak.

184
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,960
This thing was buried for 25 years.

185
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,760
I said no.

186
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,360
Call george moore,set up a meeting.

187
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,080
What the hell was that press conference?

188
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,280
It was art's idea. He did it on his own.

189
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,280
And you let him? Your job
is to control your client.

190
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,880
He won't listen to reason.

191
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,840
This incompetence is staggering.

192
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,240
Listen,asshole,this
arlington fiasco's on you.

193
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,480
I warned you from the start
this was a jackass move,

194
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,560
and now you've exposed
yourself to patty's people.

195
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,040
Now just lay low and let me do my job.

196
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,920
Clearly,you can'T.

197
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,960
Maybe I'll tell him about
you and gregory malina.

198
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,400
You don't want to do that.

199
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,080
You gave that kid stock and
told him when to sell it.

200
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,360
Arthur finds out the full
story,he'll have to settle.

201
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,600
You better be careful.

202
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,600
- I can take you down at any moment.
- Go ahead.

203
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,880
You'll be taking yourself down as well.

204
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,440
You can't touch me,ray. Arthur needs me.

205
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,280
So do you.

206
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,080
Which one do you think looks best?

207
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,040
I like this.

208
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,680
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

209
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,320
Use a windsor.

210
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,880
It's assertive and formidable.

211
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,280
You know,I never learned
how to tie that,actually.

212
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,320
Can you believe that?

213
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,040
Billionaire doesn't know
how to tie a rich man's knot?

214
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,240
Here,sit down,I'll do it for you.

215
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,120
- Holly usually helps me with this.
- Yeah?

216
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,720
I want to thank you,ray.

217
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,520
For my invaluable sartorial assistance?

218
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,200
No,for everything.

219
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,120
The last 16 years.

220
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,160
Especially the last five. I
mean,I know it hasn't been easy.

221
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,320
I know I can sometimes be kind of A...

222
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,680
Bull in a china shop?

223
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,320
This life is so full of people
trying to screw you,you know?

224
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,840
You shake hands with them one day,the
next day they're trying to stab you.

225
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,320
But you...

226
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,520
you may be the only one I can trust,ray.

227
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,880
You're a good friend.

228
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,960
Hey,yeah.

229
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,840
Let's go show 'em what we got.

230
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,760
Spe stands for special purpose entity.

231
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,000
I'd like to mark as exhibit
seven a chart entitled

232
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:12,080
frobisher value analysis
dated march 4,2001.

233
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,800
Do you recall seeing
this exhibit seven before?

234
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:21,840
It's important to establish that it wasn't
me personally that set up these entities.

235
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,200
They were incorporated under the
direction of the chief operating officer.

236
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:33,360
So,despite running the company,you take
no responsibility for these entities that

237
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,840
your coo created?

238
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,040
Insofar as I was his superior,yes,

239
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,600
a certain amount of
responsibility must be inferred.

240
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,240
But as far as direct
responsibility,no,no.

241
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,920
I don't believe that I can be
held personally responsible.

242
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,880
Mr.Frobisher,you were
intimately involved in

243
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,600
founding your
company,running your company,

244
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,320
bankrupting your company,

245
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,880
and yet you sit here today
wanting us to believe that

246
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:08,080
you have no idea where the money went.

247
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,960
Objection.

248
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,640
One more of those,counselor,and we're
going to have ourselves a problem.

249
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:18,120
Look,all those spes and-and hold co's

250
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,760
every company has them.

251
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,520
I know when you see them up there
on a big chart with all those colors

252
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:27,120
and arrows and unrestricted
this and offshore that,you...

253
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:33,000
you think they've been designed
purposefully to confuse the heck out of you.

254
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,720
And you know what?

255
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,160
It works,'cause it
confuses the hell out of me,

256
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,160
which is probably why I'm a
ceo and not a cfo or a coo.

257
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,920
So,

258
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:51,360
you don't consider it your duty
as chief executive of your company

259
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,640
to understand its
financial underpinnings?

260
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:59,400
A chief executive's job is
to set his company's agenda.

261
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,720
You're like A... you're like a coach.

262
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,240
Sometimes even a cheerleader.
You-you provide goals.

263
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,840
You lead by example.

264
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:16,720
I always believed that it was my duty
to inspire my employees so that...

265
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,760
so that together we
could build something...

266
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,600
remarkable.

267
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,280
Hello

268
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,360
Mr.Moore,it's ellen parsons.

269
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,680
She spent the day lobbing
me softballs,loosening me up.

270
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,560
It's going to get a lot tougher.

271
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,920
But ray says the day went well.

272
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,680
Good,I'm glad.

273
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,920
Is there anything you need?

274
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,120
Anything I can do to
make this easier for you?

275
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:00,080
No,just talking to you helps.

276
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,960
I love you,holly.

277
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,880
I miss you guys.

278
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,160
We miss you.

279
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,240
- Night.
- Good night,arthur.

280
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,400
He's going through so much.

281
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,880
It's been hard for
you,too. Don't forget that.

282
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,640
I'm so grateful i found you.

283
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,240
I don't know how I would...

284
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,880
Hey,we'll get through this.

285
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,560
It'll be easier once you tell him.

286
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,440
We have to wait until
after the deposition.

287
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,880
Miss parsons.

288
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,920
I put my ass on the line for you.

289
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,320
Mr.Moore.

290
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,520
I trusted you with arlington,and
your camp leaked it.

291
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,880
Why would we do that?

292
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,240
You don't understand how
frobisher operates,do you?

293
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:30,040
Someone in your office is in his pocket.

294
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,520
Or you are.

295
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,040
Grow up.

296
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,760
I could get killed for what i told you.

297
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:42,680
You people had the opportunity to
take down frobisher,and you blew it.

298
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,000
The case isn't over yet.

299
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,000
Well,we are.

300
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,600
You get nothing else from me.

301
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,160
And tell tom shayes to stop calling.

302
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,320
Mr.Moore?

303
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,920
If there's a connection between you
and arthur frobisher,we will find it.

304
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,760
Watch yourself.

305
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,920
George moore is full of shit.

306
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,080
He's saying we leaked arlington.

307
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,760
What have you found?

308
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,720
Moore was one of five sec
commissioners appointed.

309
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,720
By who?

310
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,960
The president.

311
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,680
Moore headed up a team of investigators to
look into possible fraud in frobisher's company.

312
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,720
Who's laura watkins?

313
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,080
One of moore's investigators.

314
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,440
But,in 2002,just before the
government trial,she was fired.

315
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,560
Moore said her methods were unsound.

316
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,440
After the trial,watkins
did this interview.

317
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,400
She said that moore removed her
for investigating too aggressively.

318
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,320
It was the first and last
interview she ever did.

319
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,320
You think moore shut her down?

320
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,760
Now she works for an accounting
firm here in the city.

321
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,760
Have you told patty about this?

322
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,840
No.

323
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,720
And I'm not going to until I'm
absolutely sure I have something.

324
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,600
George moore made a big show
of going after frobisher.

325
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,440
- But you didn't believe he was?
- No.

326
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,040
Behind the scenes,moore did nothing.

327
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,120
He forced us to keep investigating
frobisher's stock broker

328
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,800
months after it was clear
that it would be a dead end.

329
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,160
Did you ever figure out moore's agenda?

330
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:48,920
No.

331
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,320
But,the weekend before
frobisher dumped his stock,

332
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,520
we were getting ready to expose
the accounting fraud in his company.

333
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,880
- The same weekend frobisher was in palm beach.
- Yeah.Exactly.

334
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,520
And you know where george
moore was that same weekend?

335
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,360
No. We had no reason to look into that.

336
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,880
Well,he was in jacksonville,florida,less
than four hours away,

337
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,080
at an sec commissioners' retreat.

338
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,080
George moore chose
that location himself.

339
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,480
He said he wanted to play
the 17th hole at sawgrass.

340
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,760
Good morning.

341
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,680
- Arthur frobisher.
- Yeah.

342
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,200
I know who you are.

343
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,560
Yeah.

344
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,680
I probably shouldn't
be talking to you,huh?

345
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,280
How's the coffee here?

346
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,240
You know,when I was your age,i
used to run from moments like this,

347
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,200
standing two feet from
somebody who hates your guts.

348
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,280
Now I live for this shit.

349
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,960
Was your trip to palm beach in june
2002 primarily business or pleasure?

350
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,840
Business.

351
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,040
I was there to deliver
a speech at a luncheon.

352
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,440
That's where you met katie connor?

353
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,320
No,we never met in florida.

354
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,400
I was told later that she
was one of the caterers.

355
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,080
And,afterwards,you approached
her about financing a restaurant?

356
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,600
My attorney contacted
her on my behalf,yes.

357
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,280
Why such interest in a novice chef?

358
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,440
Objection. Vague.

359
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:21,640
At the luncheon,an herb-encrusted
pork loin made quite an impression.

360
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,560
I was told later that it
was ms.Connor's creation.

361
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:32,760
Yet your financing of ms.Connor's restaurant halted
shortly after she agreed to testify in this case.

362
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,080
Why was that?

363
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:40,080
Ms.Connor went through a
series of personal struggles.

364
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,120
Exhibit 41.

365
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,520
Please mark as exhibit 41.

366
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,080
Do you recognize this man?

367
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,240
No,I don'T.

368
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,960
Let the record reflect that exhibit
41 is a photograph of gregory malina.

369
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,960
Were you aware that mr. Malina was in
palm beach the same weekend you were?

370
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,960
No. I've never seen him before.

371
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,360
So you didn't know he was
romantically linked to ms.Connor?

372
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,440
No,I did not.

373
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,680
Or that he owned a thousand
shares of stock in your company?

374
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,560
My stock was publicly traded.
A lot of people had it.

375
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:25,520
Or that in june,2002,he sold his stock
the very same morning you sold yours?

376
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,680
No. No,I didn't know that.

377
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,600
Are you aware mr.Malina is dead?

378
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,280
No. No.

379
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,960
but,like I said,I've
never seen this man before.

380
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,880
I'm very sorry to hear that.

381
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,640
I think that will be all for today.

382
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,240
Did you give gregory
malina stock in my company?

383
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,320
Absolutely not.

384
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,320
Then who the hell tipped him off?

385
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,120
I have no idea.

386
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,720
It doesn't matter,art.
Malina can't hurt you.

387
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,360
You know what i think? I think george
moore engineered this whole hit-and-run.

388
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,960
Well,george is capable
of a lot of things.

389
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,320
What does that mean? What do you mean?

390
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,400
I think he leaked arlington.

391
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,400
Well,for christ... Why would he do that?

392
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,760
Save his own ass. Get you to settle.

393
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,200
No,don'T...

394
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,880
Senior partners wanted to meet with you.

395
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,800
- We'll talk about this later.
- Oh,for...

396
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,840
Hey,marshall,come on in.

397
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,360
Amos,good to see you.

398
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,320
Arthur,you remember marshall
phillips,amos denninger,

399
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,640
my superiors in everything
but shortness and baldness.

400
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,680
Come on in. Sit down.

401
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,160
Amos,you look good.

402
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,360
Thank you very much.

403
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,960
Mr.Frobisher,we just want to assure you that every
one of our firm's resources is at your disposal.

404
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,560
Well,marshall,i appreciate
that,but I'll tell you something.

405
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,880
With ray,here,I never
felt more confident.

406
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,520
Can I get you fellas a drink?

407
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,280
No,nothing for me,thanks.

408
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,880
Ray? I'm going to freshen
myself up here a little bit.

409
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,520
I'm fine thank you

410
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,160
********

411
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,360
Ms.Hewes,I found a way to help.

412
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,880
- I went back to george moore,and he...
- You did what?

413
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,920
I spoke with george moore.

414
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,440
Who told you to do that?

415
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,440
It was my own initiative.
I thought we should follow...

416
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,800
Thought? Who told you to think?

417
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,600
You are in this office
to wait for instructions.

418
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,120
You don't have license to think.

419
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:06,880
You have jeopardized the only
serious lead we still have.

420
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,200
How could you be so stupid?

421
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,840
Just get out of my office.

422
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,040
I'm so sick of your bullshit.

423
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,040
What did you say to me?

424
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,800
You heard me.

425
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,640
Get out.

426
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,320
And don't bother coming back.

427
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,160
Give this to patty.

428
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,000
What you looking for,boy? Hmm?

429
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,000
You a good boy?

430
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,160
Excuse me.

431
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,320
Jeez...

432
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,800
Does ms.Hewes know you're here?

433
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,960
She gave me an extra set of keys.

434
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,240
how did you get in?

435
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,800
Service elevator.

436
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,080
Ms.Hewes had a water delivery.

437
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,840
Make sure you lock up when you go.

438
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,840
Will do.

439
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,600
Ellen?

440
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,000
I was just fired.

441
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,320
What happened?

442
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,760
The thing is,I'm fine.

443
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,600
Seriously,I feel great.

444
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,360
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

445
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,000
Let's go out.

446
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,440
Let's get drunk.

447
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,760
We still have some friends,don't we?

448
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,880
- Hey,there he is.
- Art,come here.

449
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,320
I tried to head you off.

450
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,880
I've got some bad news.

451
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,680
She's divorcing me.

452
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,040
I am so sorry,art.

453
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,520
Where did you get this?

454
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,880
The papers were filed this morning.

455
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,240
God...

456
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,560
who else knows about this?

457
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,480
Well,it's just us and the
court-- it's not public yet.

458
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,560
Look,I-I'm going to
reschedule today's session.

459
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,920
No. No,no,no.

460
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,440
I've prepared for this.

461
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,880
Art... art,listen to me.

462
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:03,520
You are distracted. I cannot have you in
that room in anything less than top form.

463
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,160
I'm fine.

464
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,720
Put this away.

465
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,200
Come on.

466
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,360
Mr.Frobisher,two days after you
returned from your trip to florida,

467
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,520
you gave a speech to your employees.

468
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,160
Yes,that's correct.

469
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,960
Exhibit 67.

470
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,160
It's a transcript of mr.
Frobisher's remarks dated...

471
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:37,160
june 21,2002.

472
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:41,720
Were you aware that your company was
being investigated by the sec at the time?

473
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,480
Yes,I was.

474
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:49,040
And yet you still told your employees that
the company was on sound financial ground?

475
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,080
I was confident that we were.

476
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,720
I firmly believed that the
sec investigation would turn up

477
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,200
no financial irregularities whatsoever.

478
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,800
Exhibit 68.

479
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:04,040
This is an e-mail you sent
your cfo,is that correct?

480
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,280
Yes,it is.

481
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:11,400
It's a rough draft of the speech you wrote,the
one you intended to give your employees?

482
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,400
Yes,it appears to be that.

483
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:19,760
In the margin,you wrote the words,too
rosy,followed by a question mark.

484
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,080
Too rosy.

485
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,080
I think I was...

486
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,720
wondering about the tone of the speech.

487
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,640
I was debating whether or
not to acknowledge the...

488
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,720
the climate that we were in at the time.

489
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:38,600
By climate,you mean the sec was
about to expose your accounting fraud.

490
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,640
Objection.

491
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:45,760
For me to ignore the pending sec report
would have threatened my credibility,

492
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:51,120
so in my final speech,I decided to
mention the investigation and even A...

493
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,120
possible action against us by the sec.

494
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,160
But...

495
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:01,200
- you also continued to insist that your company was financially sound?
- Yes.

496
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,880
And your employees trusted you?

497
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,600
Absolutely.

498
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:09,160
For almost 35 years,they knew
that I was fully committed to them.

499
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,160
There's nothing more important
to the well-being of a company

500
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:17,720
than the relationshipbetween
its workers and its management.

501
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,840
Well,that'S...

502
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,120
sort of like a family,isn't it?

503
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,760
Yes,it's very much like a family.

504
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,560
And you were the head of the household?

505
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,280
You might say you were both husband
and father to your employees.

506
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,000
Objection.

507
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,760
You could say that,yes.

508
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,200
And was it your job to
hold the family together?

509
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,400
Yes,it was.

510
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,520
- And you failed.
- Objection.

511
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,000
I'll rephrase.

512
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,440
I mean... was it...

513
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,800
- very painful for you when you failed?
- Objection.

514
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,480
- I'm warning you,counselor.
- I'm merely asking mr.Frobisher

515
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,720
about his commitment to his company.

516
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:16,120
Would you agree that the crumbling
of that relationship is nothing less,

517
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,160
really,than the
dissolution of a marriage?

518
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,200
You watch what you say.

519
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,120
Your position...

520
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:30,600
is that the collapse of your company
wasn't your fault,is that right?

521
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,600
Yes,that's correct.

522
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,880
I was misled by the accountants.

523
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,080
Um,I take full responsibility
but not the blame.

524
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,520
Well,I understand--
it's like marriages.

525
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,000
Companies just fail sometime.

526
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,680
Irreconcilable differences.

527
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,960
No one is to blame.
Is that your position?

528
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,960
One more like that,and we will walk out.

529
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,240
Is that your position,mr.Frobisher?

530
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:57,600
- Or is the failure of this relationship,as you call it,your failure?
- Patty...

531
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,720
- patty,I'm warning you.
- Your breach of trust,

532
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,880
- your infidelity...
- You are out of line...

533
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,520
Goddamn it!

534
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,600
This is bullshit!

535
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,240
- This is bullshit!
- Art...

536
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,080
I'm done here. This is bullshit.

537
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,160
This is absolute
bullshit,and you know it.

538
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,560
No,I'm done. Uh-uh.

539
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,960
- No,I'm done.
- Arthur...

540
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,200
I'll see you in court,you bitch.

541
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,040
Are you kidding me? Divorce?

542
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,840
You blindsided me,you know that,holly?

543
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,160
We'll talk about this later,arthur.

544
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,920
Did you want patty hewes
to use this against me?

545
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,960
- Of course not.
- Is that what you wanted?

546
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,200
- Of course not.
- Then why now?

547
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,160
Why now,holly?

548
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,560
- Arthur,this isn't about the case,it's about us.
- Bullshit!No,bullshit!

549
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,720
You screwed me!

550
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,440
You screwed yourself,too,you know that?

551
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,440
This is our money. We're
talking about our money here.

552
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,480
- I'm sorry,arthur.
- Look at this.

553
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,320
- I gave you everything you ever wanted!
- Stay away from me.

554
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,560
Stay away from me.

555
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,480
I could've ended this
anytime I wanted,you know.

556
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,920
I could've made this go away months ago.

557
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,840
- Hey,what are you do...Come on.
- Move the car.

558
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,480
Did you even think about the
kids? You ever think about that?

559
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,320
You move that car,I will kill you.

560
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,480
open the window; let's talk. Come on.

561
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,920
Holly,come on,open the window...

562
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,600
Open the...

563
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:27,200
holly,talk to me,will ya?

564
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,760
Stop the car!

565
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,520
Stop the damn car!

566
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,840
hey,ray. The hell with this.

567
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:58,200
I can't take any more of
it. Just make an offer.

568
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,120
How's my favorite divorce attorney?

569
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,360
Men and women still hate
each other,so I'm good.

570
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,640
Oh,boy,thanks for the tip.

571
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,680
I hope it didn't get you
in trouble with your client.

572
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,080
I just blamed it on
the clerks at the court.

573
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,720
High-profile divorce like this...

574
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,480
Yeah,they would have leaked
it to the press anyway.

575
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,560
Besides,this thing's going
to be about custody...

576
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,440
and infidelity.

577
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,400
I owe you one.

578
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,160
Where they serve tequila.

579
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,040
Very nice.

580
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,640
Ellen,where are you going to work now?

581
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,240
I don't know. I have
no idea!I don't care.

582
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,680
Do you know where I can
work? Where can I work?

583
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,360
New york city subway. The
new york city subway station.

584
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,320
You could a sushi photographer.

585
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,320
Raymond.

586
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,560
- 500
- 500?

587
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,720
You heard me,patty.

588
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,240
I daresay,it's as much
as you could've hoped for.

589
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,400
More than fair.

590
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,880
Let's wrap this up.

591
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,440
Patty?

592
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,000
Oh,it's tempting,ray.

593
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,280
I could use a vacation.

594
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,680
You deserve one.

595
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,640
But I've still got work to do.

596
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,240
- Patty...
- No deal.

597
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,880
If gregory malina was worth
killing,he must have known something.

598
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:49,200
If he testified,my guess,we'd
be talking ten figures.

599
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,640
not so chatty now,are you,ray?

600
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,840
You won't get more than
500 out of my client,patty.

601
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,040
Evening,ray.

602
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,440
it didn't matter,grades were in,and
she goes,what would I do in that case?

603
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,160
Oh,I'll tell you what I would do,calder,

604
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,880
I'd-- shh,shh,let me tell it--
I'll tell you what I would do.

605
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,640
I'd 'sub-penis' him.

606
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,080
she said sub-penis!

607
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,880
She said penis in law school.

608
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:38,240
- And he was,like,who do you think you are,ms.Parsons?
- Calder with his silver streak,right?Calder?

609
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,720
I didn't know what I was
saying. He was so sleazy.

610
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,200
He kept asking me out on dates.

611
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,240
Who the hell is this
guy? where is that guy?

612
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,520
Who is it?

613
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,680
Oh,it's my mom.

614
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,480
He wanted to take you to
a drive-in of viva zapata.

615
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,520
This is ellen parsons.

616
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:04,880
You can leave a message here or
reach me at my office: 212-752-4708.

617
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,520
This is some pretty
interesting stuff you found.

618
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,440
I don't even want a goddamn centerpiece.

619
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,160
Oh,my god!

620
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,520
Sorry,I didn't realize
it was the honeymoon.

621
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,000
I'm sorry. I hate that shit.

622
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,400
You were right.

623
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:30,160
Whoever tried to clean up
the body missed something.

624
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,320
What?

625
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,600
Blood. I saw...the blood.

626
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,680
Look,I-I got to take
this to the police.

627
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,240
Did you get any word from patty?

628
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,720
I've left messages.

629
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,360
I've told her that she's
got to come back here.

630
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,040
She doesn't want to come back.

631
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,520
Why not?

632
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,520
Ellen...

633
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:55,560
patty is a lot of things,but
she's not a murderer.

634
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,480
I know things,tom.

635
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,440
Things that could destroy her.

636
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:08,080
You think patty tried to
kill you to protect herself?

637
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:12,680
Well,the only way that I'm going
to find out is if I talk to her.

638
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,680
Face-to-face.

639
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,640
So call her.

640
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:26,040
Tell her I know she wants me dead.
