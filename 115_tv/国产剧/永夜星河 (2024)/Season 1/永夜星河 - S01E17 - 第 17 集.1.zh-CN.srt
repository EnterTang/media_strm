00:00:00,043 --> 00:00:01,501
Previously on "
The Vampire Diaries"...

2
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:03,982
For over a century,
I have lived in secret

3
00:00:03,894 --> 00:00:05,779
Until now. I know the risk.

4
00:00:05,779 --> 00:00:07,146
But I have to know her.

5
00:00:07,147 --> 00:00:08,781
There's a tomb
underneath the church.

6
00:00:08,782 --> 00:00:11,317
A spell sealed katherine in
that tomb, protecting her.

7
00:00:11,318 --> 00:00:12,418
I'm gonna bring her back.

8
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:14,487
She's not there!

9
00:00:14,488 --> 00:00:16,188
You saved everyone in the church?

10
00:00:16,189 --> 00:00:18,557
We've taken up residence in a
farmhouse just outside of town.

11
00:00:18,558 --> 00:00:20,626
All 25 vampires? Some.

12
00:00:20,627 --> 00:00:24,063
I hate this house. I didn't
stay locked up for 145 years

13
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,131
To end up locked up here.

14
00:00:25,132 --> 00:00:26,666
Aah!

15
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:27,800
Ugh!

16
00:00:27,801 --> 00:00:28,768
So, where's Bethanne?

17
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:30,169
She won't be coming back.

18
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,804
My wife isabelle spent her life

19
00:00:31,805 --> 00:00:34,040
Researching paranormal
activity in this area.

20
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:35,908
What have you done to my wife?
I turned her.

21
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:38,344
Maybe there is such
a thing as vampires.

22
00:00:38,345 --> 00:00:40,179
They're just different from the
way we always thought they were.

23
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,380
Aah!

24
00:00:41,381 --> 00:00:42,748
You got a problem with blood, anna?

25
00:00:42,749 --> 00:00:44,050
Ahh!

26
00:00:44,051 --> 00:00:45,351
I knew this girl Vicki.

27
00:00:45,352 --> 00:00:47,386
She was attacked by an animal,
a bite to the neck.

28
00:00:47,387 --> 00:00:48,487
And then I saw your face.

29
00:00:48,488 --> 00:00:50,356
Why uld yoyoconfront me about it?

30
00:00:50,357 --> 00:00:51,624
Because maybe it's
true about Vicki.

31
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,793
And also because I
want you to turn me.

32
00:01:32,699 --> 00:01:34,233
I love storms.

33
00:01:34,234 --> 00:01:36,268
Is that a vampire thing?

34
00:01:36,269 --> 00:01:38,437
'cause I read vampires
don't like running water.

35
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:39,839
It's only Dracula.

36
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,608
Yeah. He was a complete wuss.

37
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:44,710
Never showered. Very smelly.

38
00:01:44,711 --> 00:01:46,112
Seriously?

39
00:01:47,948 --> 00:01:49,448
First rule about vampires--

40
00:01:49,449 --> 00:01:51,817
Don't believe anything you read.

41
00:01:52,853 --> 00:01:54,620
You gotta tell me more.
I gotta know.

42
00:01:54,621 --> 00:01:57,223
No, you don't.

43
00:01:57,224 --> 00:01:58,657
'cause you're not gonna be one.

44
00:01:58,658 --> 00:02:00,025
Come on, you can't
keep saying "No" To me.

45
00:02:00,026 --> 00:02:01,727
Look, I'm not gonna turn someone

46
00:02:01,728 --> 00:02:04,930
Who learned everything he knows
about vampires from netflix.

47
00:02:04,931 --> 00:02:06,932
That's not true, and you know it.

48
00:02:09,102 --> 00:02:11,103
Why do you even want this?

49
00:02:11,104 --> 00:02:12,838
Give me one good reason.

50
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:15,007
'cause I...

51
00:02:17,244 --> 00:02:21,113
Hmm. Let me know when you
can finish that sentence.

52
00:02:24,818 --> 00:02:27,186
Hey, you're still up.

53
00:02:27,187 --> 00:02:28,521
Hey, what's up?

54
00:02:28,522 --> 00:02:30,389
Looks like the there's
a big storm rolling in.

55
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,858
Can you help make sure all
the windows are closed?

56
00:02:32,859 --> 00:02:34,794
Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

57
00:02:46,807 --> 00:02:49,074
We're running low on blood.

58
00:02:49,075 --> 00:02:52,111
You might wanna send anna to
the hospital to get some more.

59
00:02:52,112 --> 00:02:54,146
I'll send her out
for some tomorrow.

60
00:02:54,147 --> 00:02:55,848
Maybe I could w wh?? her.

61
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:57,115
If the storm keeps it dark enough,

62
00:02:57,115 --> 00:03:00,467
I might be able to go out
during the day, no sun and all.

63
00:03:00,467 --> 00:03:01,554
I'm afraid not.

64
00:03:01,555 --> 00:03:04,356
Not after your stunt at the
salvatore house tonight.

65
00:03:04,357 --> 00:03:05,891
He and his brother deserved it.

66
00:03:05,892 --> 00:03:07,293
And where did that get you?

67
00:03:07,294 --> 00:03:09,061
Your girlfriend Bethanne is dead.

68
00:03:09,062 --> 00:03:11,564
And you have no one
to blame but yourself.

69
00:03:11,565 --> 00:03:14,533
We cannot live our
lives about revenge.

70
00:03:14,534 --> 00:03:17,536
We have to have better
control of our emotions.

71
00:03:17,537 --> 00:03:19,605
I understand, miss pearl.

72
00:03:19,606 --> 00:03:22,374
I just wish I knew
what you were up to.

73
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,115
I'm going to make an exploratory
visit into town tomorrow

74
00:03:30,116 --> 00:03:33,719
To assess who's under the influence
of vervain and who isn't.

75
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,889
Anna tells me that the
players haven't changed much.

76
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,791
It's still the lockwoods,
the forbes, the fells--

77
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:40,426
We should kill every
last one of them.

78
00:03:40,427 --> 00:03:43,562
We are smarter than that,
Frederick.

79
00:03:43,563 --> 00:03:46,232
These people are not our enemies.

80
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:49,068
We don't hold grudges
and resentments.

81
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:51,036
We'll get our town back.

82
00:03:51,037 --> 00:03:54,573
We just have to have patience.

83
00:04:05,852 --> 00:04:07,653
You heard her.

84
00:04:07,654 --> 00:04:10,155
No revenge.

85
00:04:10,156 --> 00:04:11,257
Patience.

86
00:04:12,292 --> 00:04:13,959
Self-control.

87
00:04:17,931 --> 00:04:20,766
She seems to have it all
figured out, doesn't she?

88
00:04:22,467 --> 00:04:28,467
Sync by kuniva

89
00:04:32,178 --> 00:04:34,480
I say we go to pearl's,
bust down the door,

90
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:36,482
And annihilate the idiot
that attacked us last night.

91
00:04:36,483 --> 00:04:37,365
Yeah. And then what?

92
00:04:37,366 --> 00:04:39,351
We turn to the rest of
that house of vampires

93
00:04:39,352 --> 00:04:40,886
And say, "Oops. Sorry?"

94
00:04:40,887 --> 00:04:42,354
I can't believe you
made a deal with her.

95
00:04:42,355 --> 00:04:45,858
It was more like a helpful
exchange of information.

96
00:04:45,859 --> 00:04:49,328
And it was not exactly like
I had a choice. She's...

97
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:50,663
Scary.

98
00:04:50,664 --> 00:04:53,666
Besides, she's gonna help
me get katherine back.

99
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:55,134
Of course she is.

100
00:04:55,135 --> 00:04:56,535
Damon gets what he wants, as usual.

101
00:04:56,536 --> 00:04:58,170
No matter who he
hurts in the process.

102
00:04:58,171 --> 00:05:00,072
You don't have to
be snarky about it.

103
00:05:00,073 --> 00:05:02,041
I woke up this morning

104
00:05:02,042 --> 00:05:04,677
To learn that all the vampires
have been released from the tomb.

105
00:05:04,678 --> 00:05:06,178
I've earned snarky.

106
00:05:06,179 --> 00:05:08,647
How long are you going to blame me

107
00:05:08,648 --> 00:05:10,983
For turning your birth
mother into a vampire?

108
00:05:10,984 --> 00:05:12,551
I'm not blaming you, damon.

109
00:05:12,552 --> 00:05:14,820
I've accepted the fact that
you're a self-serving psychopath

110
00:05:14,821 --> 00:05:16,121
With no redeeming qualities.

111
00:05:16,122 --> 00:05:17,690
Ouch.

112
00:05:17,691 --> 00:05:19,325
This isn't being very productive.

113
00:05:19,326 --> 00:05:22,027
We're figure out a way to deal
with pearl and the vampires. Yeah?

114
00:05:22,028 --> 00:05:24,129
Hmm.

115
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:29,535
I'm sorry. He just
makes me so cranky.

116
00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:31,170
I know. He makes everybody cranky.

117
00:05:31,171 --> 00:05:32,671
So, what are we going to do?

118
00:05:32,672 --> 00:05:35,641
Damon and I are gonna handle
everything, I promise.

119
00:05:35,642 --> 00:05:36,942
Well, what about me?

120
00:05:36,943 --> 00:05:38,243
I can't just sit
here and do nothing.

121
00:05:38,244 --> 00:05:39,678
That's exactly what
you're gonna do,

122
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:41,146
Because that's what
going to keep you safe.

123
00:05:41,147 --> 00:05:43,882
Which means nothing if
you're not safe, too.

124
00:05:43,883 --> 00:05:45,250
What do you mean?
I'm perfectly safe.

125
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:48,620
I have damon, the self-serving
psychopath on my side.

126
00:05:48,621 --> 00:05:51,023
Well, that's comforting.

127
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,398
Ok. We have some time.

128
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,899
I'm not meeting my mom until later.

129
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,935
Wait. Does your mom
know you're a...

130
00:06:02,936 --> 00:06:04,436
The fact that you would
even think it's possible

131
00:06:04,437 --> 00:06:06,405
To keep something like that a
secret from your own family

132
00:06:06,406 --> 00:06:08,440
Is just further proof
that you're not ready.

133
00:06:08,441 --> 00:06:10,476
"Not ready" Is a step up from "No."

134
00:06:10,477 --> 00:06:12,678
And a million steps
down from "Maybe."

135
00:06:15,548 --> 00:06:17,082
I like your bracelet.

136
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,018
Thanks. My sister got it for me.

137
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,420
Can I see it?

138
00:06:21,421 --> 00:06:22,454
Yeah. Yeah.

139
00:06:26,393 --> 00:06:29,495
Your sister doesn't know you're
hanging out with me, does she?

140
00:06:29,496 --> 00:06:32,031
No. No. But I don't see
why it would be a problem.

141
00:06:32,032 --> 00:06:33,899
It's not like she
knows what you are.

142
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,769
I'd rather keep it
our little secret.

143
00:06:38,405 --> 00:06:42,608
You know, why don't you...
why don't you keep this?

144
00:06:42,609 --> 00:06:45,611
Why would you give this to me?

145
00:06:45,612 --> 00:06:50,149
Because. You like it.
And I like you.

146
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,985
You only like me because
of what you want from me.

147
00:06:52,986 --> 00:06:55,721
No. I...I like you.

148
00:07:00,994 --> 00:07:03,195
Um...

149
00:07:03,196 --> 00:07:05,431
You know, you should wear it.

150
00:07:05,432 --> 00:07:07,666
It looks better on you.

151
00:07:10,904 --> 00:07:12,771
I yelled at my mom last night.

152
00:07:12,772 --> 00:07:16,375
You know, I feel like the
parent and the screwed-up kid.

153
00:07:16,376 --> 00:07:17,843
Maybe she needed to hear it.

154
00:07:17,844 --> 00:07:19,845
Yeah, but just... I worry
that if I push too hard,

155
00:07:19,846 --> 00:07:21,447
Then she will take off again.

156
00:07:21,448 --> 00:07:23,015
'cause that's her m.O.

157
00:07:23,016 --> 00:07:26,785
Just like Vicki, who I haven't
heard from since she left.

158
00:07:26,786 --> 00:07:28,454
Well, you can't control
your mom, matt,

159
00:07:28,455 --> 00:07:30,689
Any more than you can
control your sister.

160
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,492
I wish that she would just
try a little. You know?

161
00:07:33,493 --> 00:07:35,928
If she would just try to try,
that'd be ok.

162
00:07:35,929 --> 00:07:37,663
Maybe she'll surprise you.

163
00:07:37,664 --> 00:07:40,199
People have a tendency to do that.

164
00:07:42,502 --> 00:07:46,472
I should go before the roads
get even worse from the storm.

165
00:07:46,473 --> 00:07:49,141
Yeah. Are you sure you
should be driving right now?

166
00:07:49,142 --> 00:07:52,945
I have to. It's my dad's
boyfriend's daughter's birthday.

167
00:07:52,946 --> 00:07:56,014
We have a non-traditional
traditional ritual.

168
00:07:56,015 --> 00:07:59,284
Well, buckle up. Don't speed.

169
00:07:59,285 --> 00:08:00,986
Stay off your cell phone.

170
00:08:00,987 --> 00:08:02,654
And call me when you get there.

171
00:08:02,655 --> 00:08:05,324
Got it. Anything else?

172
00:08:05,325 --> 00:08:06,492
Yes.

173
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,030
Bye.

174
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,365
Bye.

175
00:08:19,772 --> 00:08:21,240
Hunting party?

176
00:08:21,241 --> 00:08:23,242
That guy did a number on me
last night when he stabbed me.

177
00:08:23,243 --> 00:08:24,710
I gotta get my strength back up.

178
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:26,712
I've got 2 liters of
soccer mom in the fridge.

179
00:08:27,881 --> 00:08:28,881
No?

180
00:08:30,717 --> 00:08:32,184
We'll talk when I get back?

181
00:08:32,185 --> 00:08:34,820
All right. Give my
regards to the squirrels.

182
00:08:52,505 --> 00:08:54,006
Aah!

183
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,126
You're ignoring me

184
00:09:13,127 --> 00:09:15,989
The 6 missed calls? Sorry.
My phone is dead.

185
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,365
Is stefan here? No.

186
00:09:18,366 --> 00:09:19,432
Why?

187
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,295
Something wrong?

188
00:09:20,295 --> 00:09:21,900
He went out to the woods
and didn't come back.

189
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,965
I can't get him on his phone.

190
00:09:22,965 --> 00:09:26,072
I figured he was here with you.

191
00:09:26,073 --> 00:09:28,541
It's going straight to voicemail.

192
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:29,948
Where could he be?

193
00:09:29,948 --> 00:09:33,246
You're not going to
like what I'm thinking.

194
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:36,976
Pearl! Open this door.

195
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:39,712
I swear to god I'll bust
through and rip your head off.

196
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,214
Pearl's not home.

197
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:46,852
Hmm. Beautiful weather.

198
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,388
Not a ray of sun in the sky.

199
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:50,856
Where's my brother?

200
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:53,659
Billy.

201
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:01,700
You're dead. Whoa. I'm sorry.

202
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,836
You haven't been invited in.

203
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,204
Miss gibbons?

204
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:07,106
Yes, Frederick honey?

205
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,475
Never let this bad man in.

206
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:12,077
I'll never let him in.

207
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:15,414
Ugh!

208
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:17,349
145 years left starving in a tomb,

209
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,253
Thanks to katherine's infatuation
with you and your brother.

210
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:22,988
First few weeks,

211
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:26,458
Every single nerve in your
body screams with fire.

212
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,028
The kind of pain that
can drive a person mad.

213
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,863
Well...

214
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:33,365
I thought your brother might've
wanted to get a taste of that

215
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,768
Before I killed him. Billy.

216
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:37,703
Uhh!

217
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,539
Aah!

218
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,541
You have a nice day.

219
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:55,154
What happened? Where is he?

220
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,422
They have him. I can't get in.

221
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:57,756
Why not?

222
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,191
Because the woman
that owns the house

223
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:00,693
Is compelled to not let me in.

224
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:02,461
I can get in.

225
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:03,629
You're not going in there.

226
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,863
I'm going! You're not going there.

227
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:08,167
Why are they doing this?
What do they want with him?

228
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,836
Revenge. They want revenge.

229
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,705
We gotta do something.

230
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:14,139
I know.

231
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,607
We can't let them hurt him.
We gotta get him out of there.

232
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,143
I know. Elena, I know.

233
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,279
But I don't know
how to get him out.

234
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:41,967
Vervain on the ropes.

235
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,705
Aah! Unh!

236
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,006
That's gotta sting.

237
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:51,577
Speaking of...

238
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,818
Aah!

239
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,687
This isn't right!

240
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:07,426
He killed Bethanne.

241
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:09,394
One of us, harper.

242
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,370
And don't think for a second

243
00:12:11,371 --> 00:12:14,333
he wouldn't kill you
if he had the chance.

244
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,869
Pearl says we're not
here for revenge, right?

245
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:20,139
I say that's exactly
what we're here for.

246
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,611
Starting with this.

247
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:27,980
Aah! Aah!

248
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:31,150
And then his brother.

249
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:33,418
And anyone else that
gets in our way.

250
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,720
This isn't right!

251
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:36,455
You're gonna want to let go of me!

252
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:38,357
Miss pearl will be home soon.

253
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:41,727
Miss pearl is no longer in charge.

254
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:45,297
Tie him up! And then stake him.

255
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:59,678
Well, don't you look... alive?

256
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,213
You can't hurt me.

257
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:03,048
Oh, I can hurt you, all right.

258
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,019
Mr. Saltzman.

259
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:11,356
We need your help.

260
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,025
Stefan's in the house.

261
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:15,360
Damon's a vampire.
He can't get in. We need you.

262
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:16,728
I would go, but--

263
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,131
Your life is valuable.

264
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,432
Yours, on the other hand...

265
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:22,568
Stefan told me about your ring.

266
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:23,602
What about it?

267
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:24,636
Let me recap...

268
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,371
You tried to kill me.
I defended myself.

269
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,673
You died.

270
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:28,841
Then according to my brother,

271
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:30,576
Your ring brought you back to life.

272
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:32,744
Am I leaving anything out?

273
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:35,247
Yeah. The part where I
try and kill you again.

274
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:36,915
Only this time, I don't miss.

275
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,317
Mr. Saltzman. Please.

276
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,518
It's stefan.

277
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:44,256
I'm sorry, elena.
But it's not my problem.

278
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:45,390
That's a shame.

279
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,558
Because the woman in
charge of the crowd

280
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,960
Can help you find your wife.

281
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,997
You're lying. Am I?

282
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,932
Why don't you ask her yourself?

283
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,301
Coward.

284
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:57,603
Come on, elena.

285
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,443
All right! Wait.

286
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:12,184
So, I have an answer.

287
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,352
To what?

288
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,519
Why you should turn me.

289
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,288
We're back to that?

290
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:20,959
Look, I wake up every day,
and I feel ok,

291
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,761
But there's something missing.

292
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:25,197
Like a--like a hole.

293
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,000
Some people, they fit...
in life, or whatever.

294
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:29,768
I... I don't.

295
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:33,038
So, you want a pity-turn?

296
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,806
I don't think so.

297
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:39,611
You should turn me because
I don't have anything else.

298
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,717
Do you even know why
we turn other people?

299
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:49,788
It's not to give someone a one-way
ticket out of loner-hood. Ok?

300
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:52,724
One--we need someone
to do our dirty work.

301
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,493
Two, revenge.

302
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:57,729
Three, boredom... but, you know,
that never turns out well.

303
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,266
And then there's the obviouone.

304
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:06,371
You love someone so much
that you would do anything

305
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,840
To spend all of eternity with them.

306
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:16,782
Ahem. I'm sorry, but you don't
fit any of those categories yet.

307
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:23,155
So, yeah. Just make sure
your thesis is clear,

308
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:25,090
And she'll love it.

309
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,792
See you later.

310
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:34,099
Mom, hey. Did you get everything?

311
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,468
The blood-bank was understaffed
because of the rain.

312
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:37,936
I was in and out.

313
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,604
Who's that you were talking to?

314
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,440
A friend from the library.

315
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,674
Let's get home.

316
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:47,079
Hey, you're not going
out in that, are ya?

317
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,881
The roads are dangerous.
Route 5 is completely flooded.

318
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:51,750
We'll make do.

319
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,585
Mayor lockwood,
we have your table ready.

320
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,020
Great.

321
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:56,588
Mayor...lockwood, is it?

322
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:01,793
I suppose it is
treacherous outside.

323
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,562
My name is pearl.

324
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:04,863
Hi.

325
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:06,865
This is my daughter anna.

326
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:08,567
We've just recently moved to town.

327
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:12,104
Welcome. Richard lockwood.
This is my son tyler.

328
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:13,939
Please--please, join us.

329
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:17,009
It would be a pleasure.

330
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:22,114
Be more creepy, dad.

331
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:24,082
Not like your son is
standing right here.

332
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,985
Grow up. Elections are coming.

333
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,655
She's a constituent.
And a rich one, from the looks of it.

334
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,425
You can tell all that
by looking at her ass?

335
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,894
Awesome. I'm gonna
go shoot some pool.

336
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:42,768
Teacher by day,
vampire hunter by night.

337
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:45,971
I've you to thank for that.
What are these?

338
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:48,507
Those are tranquilizer
darts filled with vervain.

339
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,142
Just get me in.
I'll get stefan out.

340
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:53,478
That's your plan? You're just
gonna take them all on yourself?

341
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:56,648
Well, I'll be a little
stealthier than that, hopefully.

342
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,083
Whoa. What are you doing?

343
00:16:58,084 --> 00:16:59,284
I'm going with you.

344
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:01,520
No. No. No. No. No way.

345
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,422
You need me. I'll get in.

346
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:05,290
You could distract them,
and then I'll get stefan out.

347
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,792
You'll get yourself killed.
You're not going in there.

348
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:08,060
I'm going.

349
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:10,762
So, when you get me in,
get out as quickly as you can.

350
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,631
I know how to sneak around
where they can't hear me.

351
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:15,333
You'll basically
just be in the way.

352
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,669
Damon, now is not the time
to be the lone ranger.

353
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,838
Fine. Elena, you can
drive the getaway car.

354
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,540
You're not going in the house.

355
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:25,077
You can't stop me. It's stefan
we're talking about here.

356
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:26,378
You don't understand.

357
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,780
Oh, I understand. I understand.

358
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,382
He's the reason you live.

359
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,852
His love lifts you up where
you belong. I get it.

360
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:35,821
Can you not joke
around for 2 seconds?

361
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:37,622
I can't protect you, elena.

362
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,691
I don't know how many
vampires there are in there.

363
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:42,561
That's how long it takes you
to get your head ripped off.

364
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,030
I have to be able to
get in and get out.

365
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:46,998
I can't be distracted
with your safety.

366
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:51,436
Or this will end up a bloodbath
that none of us walk away from...

367
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,371
Including stefan.

368
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,076
I know.

369
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,645
I get it.

370
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,647
I understand.

371
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,152
If we're gonna go, let's go.

372
00:18:17,793 --> 00:18:20,095
Where are you?
I can barely hear you.

373
00:18:20,096 --> 00:18:22,230
I was supposed to go to my dad's,
but route 5 closed down.

374
00:18:22,231 --> 00:18:26,201
Now I'm detoured on some
random backwoods path to hell.

375
00:18:26,202 --> 00:18:27,969
Well, you shouldn't be
talking while you're driving.

376
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,571
I know, right?

377
00:18:29,572 --> 00:18:31,673
I need one of those
bluetooth thingies.

378
00:18:31,674 --> 00:18:32,941
Look, you're breaking up.

379
00:18:32,942 --> 00:18:35,043
Just turn around and go
back the same way you came.

380
00:18:35,044 --> 00:18:37,112
And watch the road. Ok?

381
00:18:37,113 --> 00:18:38,580
Ok.

382
00:18:46,055 --> 00:18:47,422
God.

383
00:18:53,462 --> 00:18:54,863
Ohh.

384
00:19:14,216 --> 00:19:16,384
Oh, good, someone's home.

385
00:19:16,385 --> 00:19:18,420
Uh, could I use your phone?

386
00:19:18,421 --> 00:19:21,056
My--my car broke down a
few miles up the road.

387
00:19:21,057 --> 00:19:22,957
This was the first house I saw.

388
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,200
Well, lucky you.

389
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,094
Yeah. Lucky me.

390
00:19:26,095 --> 00:19:27,429
It's no trouble, is it?

391
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,130
Not the slightest.

392
00:19:29,131 --> 00:19:31,199
Great. Whew.

393
00:19:32,501 --> 00:19:34,235
Hey, man, I really appreciate it.

394
00:19:34,236 --> 00:19:35,870
It's rough out there.

395
00:19:35,871 --> 00:19:39,374
Billy, show our visitor where
the phone is in the kitchen.

396
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:40,875
And get me something to drink.

397
00:19:40,876 --> 00:19:42,243
Yeah. Sure thing.

398
00:19:48,451 --> 00:19:51,419
Hey, miss gibbons,
this guy wants to use your phone.

399
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:55,490
Oh, sure, honey. It's right there.

400
00:19:55,491 --> 00:19:57,158
Thanks.

401
00:20:01,063 --> 00:20:02,831
Aah!

402
00:20:05,668 --> 00:20:07,535
What's happening?

403
00:20:07,536 --> 00:20:09,237
I'm really sorry.
But you're gonna need to invite

404
00:20:09,238 --> 00:20:10,905
A friend of mine inside.

405
00:20:10,906 --> 00:20:13,341
Oh, I'm sorry.
He's not allowed in the house.

406
00:20:13,342 --> 00:20:14,609
I know that. But you
gotta make an exception.

407
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,444
Get her out of the house. Now!

408
00:20:16,445 --> 00:20:18,646
Miss gibbons, tell me the truth.

409
00:20:18,647 --> 00:20:20,148
Are you married? No.

410
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:22,384
Parents, children, anyone else
who lives on this property?

411
00:20:22,385 --> 00:20:23,752
No. It's just me.

412
00:20:23,753 --> 00:20:25,286
Good.

413
00:20:27,356 --> 00:20:28,990
You were supposed to compel her.

414
00:20:28,991 --> 00:20:30,859
It doesn't work that...
she was human.

415
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,861
And I'm not! So, I don't care.

416
00:20:32,862 --> 00:20:35,463
Now, get out of here.
Get rid of the body!

417
00:21:05,628 --> 00:21:08,129
I'm in the process of
obtaining some property.

418
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,060
I understand that your

419
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:10,965
family is the largest
property owner in town.

420
00:21:10,966 --> 00:21:13,034
Well, yes we are.

421
00:21:13,035 --> 00:21:15,637
Dating all the way back to
the town's original charter.

422
00:21:15,638 --> 00:21:19,841
Youramilily me into a lot
of new property in 1864.

423
00:21:19,842 --> 00:21:21,609
You know your history.

424
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:24,379
It's a passion of mine.

425
00:21:25,448 --> 00:21:27,081
Guy's not even subtle about it.

426
00:21:27,082 --> 00:21:28,950
Who is that?

427
00:21:28,951 --> 00:21:30,785
It's not my mother.

428
00:21:59,669 --> 00:22:00,716
eeeeee

429
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:05,430
eeeeeeeee

430
00:22:09,925 --> 00:22:11,793
I'm sorry, mayor.

431
00:22:11,794 --> 00:22:14,162
Do you know that boy over there?

432
00:22:14,163 --> 00:22:15,797
That's jeremy gilbert.

433
00:22:15,798 --> 00:22:17,966
You don't say.

434
00:22:23,806 --> 00:22:26,975
Billy, what's the holdup?!

435
00:22:40,322 --> 00:22:41,322
Aah!

436
00:22:52,368 --> 00:22:54,002
Damn it, elena!

437
00:23:06,081 --> 00:23:09,083
Billy, jacob, get back in here!

438
00:23:55,836 --> 00:23:57,169
Are you insane?

439
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,335
Aah!

440
00:25:09,851 --> 00:25:10,985
Aah!

441
00:25:23,365 --> 00:25:24,865
Jeremy gilbert?

442
00:25:24,866 --> 00:25:27,101
Is that what you've been up to?

443
00:25:28,303 --> 00:25:30,804
He's my friend.
What's the big deal?

444
00:25:30,805 --> 00:25:32,344
His family is the reason

445
00:25:32,345 --> 00:25:34,975
I was stuck in a tomb
for over a century.

446
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,744
That doesn't mean he'll
make the same choices.

447
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:38,879
I want you to stop seeing him.

448
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,515
I've been on my own for
a long time, mother.

449
00:25:41,516 --> 00:25:43,150
I can make my own decisions.

450
00:25:43,151 --> 00:25:45,386
Then stop acting like a child!

451
00:25:45,387 --> 00:25:46,708
As soon as jeremy finds

452
00:25:46,709 --> 00:25:49,123
out what you really are,
he will turn on...

453
00:25:49,124 --> 00:25:50,624
He already knows.

454
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:52,560
What did you just say?

455
00:25:52,561 --> 00:25:54,161
Jeremy knows.

456
00:25:54,162 --> 00:25:57,031
He likes it. And he likes me.

457
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:18,919
Unh.

458
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,888
Uhh!

459
00:26:21,957 --> 00:26:23,624
Thank you.

460
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:26,260
For trying to help me.

461
00:26:26,261 --> 00:26:28,596
They just needed somebody to blame.

462
00:26:28,597 --> 00:26:31,165
Someone to punish.

463
00:26:32,867 --> 00:26:35,269
Elena...

464
00:26:36,271 --> 00:26:37,404
You shouldn't be here...

465
00:26:37,405 --> 00:26:40,507
She was supposed
to stay in the car.

466
00:26:40,508 --> 00:26:42,776
Unh! No. No. No. Not him.

467
00:26:42,777 --> 00:26:45,546
Whatever. Let's get you down.

468
00:26:45,547 --> 00:26:46,780
Aah!

469
00:26:46,781 --> 00:26:48,182
There's vervain on the ropes.

470
00:26:48,183 --> 00:26:50,251
Elena, pull that.

471
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:53,687
Unh!

472
00:26:53,688 --> 00:26:56,290
All right, let's go. Clothes on.

473
00:26:56,291 --> 00:26:58,092
Wait. What? Guys, come on.

474
00:26:58,093 --> 00:26:59,727
We have to get out of here.

475
00:27:01,196 --> 00:27:02,696
Uhh! Come on, we gotta go.

476
00:27:02,697 --> 00:27:04,832
The other one.

477
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:06,934
Uhh!

478
00:27:06,935 --> 00:27:08,769
Oh, my God.

479
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:11,171
Can you get him in the car?

480
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:13,007
Yeah. All right, go.

481
00:27:13,008 --> 00:27:14,275
What about you?

482
00:27:14,276 --> 00:27:16,310
You rescue, I'll distract. Go.

483
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:22,283
Turn that down.

484
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:32,593
It's too quiet.

485
00:27:36,431 --> 00:27:39,433
Spread out. Now.

486
00:27:42,604 --> 00:27:44,672
You two, back of the house. Go.

487
00:27:44,673 --> 00:27:47,241
Check out both rooms. Cellar, now.

488
00:27:54,816 --> 00:27:56,550
Unh. Can you make it?

489
00:27:57,552 --> 00:28:00,321
Uhh! Unh.

490
00:28:02,057 --> 00:28:05,092
Ohh. You ok?

491
00:28:05,093 --> 00:28:06,527
Yeah.

492
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,896
Come on, we gotta
keep going. Come on.

493
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:10,331
Ugh.

494
00:28:15,036 --> 00:28:17,004
Aah! Ugh!

495
00:28:17,005 --> 00:28:19,440
Aah! Aah!

496
00:28:47,702 --> 00:28:49,370
I'm going after Frederick!

497
00:28:51,706 --> 00:28:54,141
Come on, it's right over here.

498
00:29:18,833 --> 00:29:21,135
Stefan...

499
00:29:21,136 --> 00:29:22,469
Aah!

500
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,637
Ugh!

501
00:29:29,844 --> 00:29:31,745
Uhh...

502
00:29:39,788 --> 00:29:41,622
This is for Bethanne.

503
00:29:41,623 --> 00:29:43,424
Aah!

504
00:29:45,126 --> 00:29:47,161
And this is for the tomb.

505
00:29:47,162 --> 00:29:48,429
Ugh! Unh!

506
00:29:55,637 --> 00:29:57,237
Stefan...

507
00:29:57,238 --> 00:29:58,806
Unh.

508
00:29:58,807 --> 00:29:59,840
Uhh.

509
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:05,078
Stefan...

510
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:06,313
Stefan...

511
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:09,650
No, stefan.

512
00:30:09,651 --> 00:30:11,752
Stefan, Stefan.

513
00:30:11,753 --> 00:30:13,887
Stefan! Stefan!

514
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,634
Hey, mom.

515
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:14,338
What's going on?

516
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:16,974
What's it look like?

517
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:19,543
Honestly, I wouldn't know.
I've never seen it before.

518
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:22,213
Well, sit down.
You might wanna order pizza.

519
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:23,681
I'm out of practice.

520
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:26,417
Mmm. Mystery casserole. Yum.

521
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:29,620
Yeah. Some people aren't
meant for the kitchen.

522
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:34,325
What?

523
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:37,328
Uh, I know it's been rough.

524
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:39,997
But I'm gonna try.
I mean, really try this time.

525
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:43,067
You just have to bear with me, ok?

526
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:44,635
Ok.

527
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:46,837
Ok. Good.

528
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:49,373
I got it.

529
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:51,008
That bad, huh?

530
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,381
What happened to you?

531
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:00,718
Hey, matt.

532
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:02,786
Hey.

533
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:05,256
What's going on?

534
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,124
Is your mom home?

535
00:32:08,827 --> 00:32:10,327
All right, give me 10 minutes.

536
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:12,296
And keep it out of the
news until I get there.

537
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:14,398
Grab your stuff. We gotta go.

538
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,666
Kinda got half a burger left.

539
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,501
They found Vicki donovan.

540
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:20,504
Are you serious? Where was she?

541
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:22,573
Storm unearthed the
grave off county road.

542
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:24,575
They just brought her
body down to the morgue.

543
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:27,678
Wait. She's dead?

544
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:30,981
Come on, we gotta go.

545
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,901
Stefan, please.

546
00:32:39,902 --> 00:32:42,170
Stefan!

547
00:32:45,108 --> 00:32:48,043
Oh, stefan, please get up.
Get up, stefan.

548
00:32:50,747 --> 00:32:52,080
Stefan.

549
00:32:56,986 --> 00:32:58,386
Here.

550
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:02,991
Elena, please run.

551
00:33:02,992 --> 00:33:04,326
No. Please.

552
00:33:04,327 --> 00:33:06,928
Please, stefan. My wrists.

553
00:33:06,929 --> 00:33:09,397
Here. Take my wrist.
You need more blood.

554
00:33:09,398 --> 00:33:11,800
Go, elena. Run. Run...

555
00:33:11,801 --> 00:33:13,435
No.

556
00:33:13,436 --> 00:33:16,471
I trust you.

557
00:33:46,102 --> 00:33:48,270
So, what you said to get me
to do this, about my wife.

558
00:33:48,271 --> 00:33:50,238
It was a lie, wasn't it?

559
00:33:50,239 --> 00:33:52,407
Yep.

560
00:34:08,491 --> 00:34:09,825
What did you do?

561
00:34:09,826 --> 00:34:11,092
Me?

562
00:34:11,093 --> 00:34:13,094
Your merry little band of vampires

563
00:34:13,095 --> 00:34:15,430
Spent the day torturing my brother.

564
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:20,836
Trust me. The parties responsible
for this will be dealt with.

565
00:34:20,837 --> 00:34:21,770
Our little arrangement

566
00:34:21,771 --> 00:34:23,638
doesn't work unless you
learn to contr t the

567
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,140
This wasn't supposed to happen.

568
00:34:25,141 --> 00:34:26,208
Well, it did.

569
00:34:26,209 --> 00:34:27,709
If I had a good side...

570
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:30,011
Not a way to get on it.

571
00:34:50,766 --> 00:34:53,835
Argh!

572
00:34:53,836 --> 00:34:55,103
Ahh!

573
00:34:56,672 --> 00:34:57,939
Aah!

574
00:34:59,575 --> 00:35:01,343
Aah!

575
00:35:04,881 --> 00:35:06,381
Stefan!

576
00:35:06,382 --> 00:35:08,183
Argh!

577
00:35:56,111 --> 00:35:58,613
How are you doing?

578
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:01,382
I'm ok.

579
00:36:01,383 --> 00:36:03,217
The wounds have mostly healed.

580
00:36:03,218 --> 00:36:05,386
Good.

581
00:36:08,023 --> 00:36:09,424
Elena...

582
00:36:09,425 --> 00:36:10,792
Yeah?

583
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:13,394
What you did today,

584
00:36:13,395 --> 00:36:15,496
Coming to help me...

585
00:36:17,399 --> 00:36:19,500
You could have been killed.

586
00:36:19,501 --> 00:36:21,669
I know.

587
00:36:23,505 --> 00:36:25,740
And what I did, I'm sorry that...

588
00:36:28,377 --> 00:36:31,612
I'm sorry that you had to see it.

589
00:36:31,613 --> 00:36:34,115
I've just never--

590
00:36:34,116 --> 00:36:36,751
You were like this other person.

591
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,588
And it's my fault. I made you--

592
00:36:40,589 --> 00:36:42,256
No. No. No. No.

593
00:36:42,257 --> 00:36:45,026
You didn't make me do anything.
You were saving my life.

594
00:36:47,596 --> 00:36:50,598
And I was saving yours.

595
00:36:56,405 --> 00:36:58,706
Everything's gonna be ok.

596
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,587
Hey, jer...

597
00:37:13,956 --> 00:37:17,225
What--what's going on?

598
00:37:18,327 --> 00:37:20,361
Oh, no.

599
00:37:54,463 --> 00:37:56,531
I made you some coffee.

600
00:37:56,532 --> 00:37:58,032
Thanks.

601
00:37:58,033 --> 00:38:00,201
Are you...

602
00:38:00,202 --> 00:38:03,604
Is there anything I can do?

603
00:38:11,213 --> 00:38:13,748
I just, uh...

604
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:16,050
I need to be alone right now.

605
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:37,505
Matt...

606
00:38:52,354 --> 00:38:54,388
Oh, man.

607
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:58,759
That was fun.

608
00:38:59,928 --> 00:39:01,929
Oh, don't look at me like that.

609
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:04,398
I know you hate me.

610
00:39:04,399 --> 00:39:09,170
Guess what? Everyone hates me.

611
00:39:09,171 --> 00:39:11,939
But you can't deny it.

612
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,809
We were bad-ass.

613
00:39:21,517 --> 00:39:23,584
Uhh.

614
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:30,691
Happens.

615
00:39:35,731 --> 00:39:37,498
Jer--

616
00:39:38,867 --> 00:39:40,134
Are you ok?

617
00:39:40,135 --> 00:39:42,770
I'm gonna go get some sleep.

618
00:40:18,407 --> 00:40:20,141
What are you doing?

619
00:40:24,313 --> 00:40:28,249
My...my friend Vicki...

620
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:30,718
She's...

621
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,453
She's dead.

622
00:40:34,022 --> 00:40:35,756
Vicki?

623
00:40:35,757 --> 00:40:37,692
The one you thought was a...

624
00:40:37,693 --> 00:40:39,727
Yep.

625
00:40:40,963 --> 00:40:44,131
Turns out she's
been dead all along.

626
00:40:46,201 --> 00:40:48,703
She's the reason
you wanted to turn.

627
00:40:51,373 --> 00:40:53,708
You wanted to be with her.

628
00:41:01,249 --> 00:41:03,384
Look, I'm sorry.
