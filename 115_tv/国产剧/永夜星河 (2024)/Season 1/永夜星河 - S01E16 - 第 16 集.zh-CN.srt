1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,180
- I got him!
- Take him down!
- 超过他了!
- 打败他!

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:04,990
- He's got you, sheldon.
- Look at this move!
- 他超过你了 Sheldon
- 瞧这下!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,710
He's completely schooling you.
他完全超过你了

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,180
Hey, guys, guys, some of the other
waitresses wanted me to ask you something.
嘿 伙计们 伙计们
别的女服务生要我问你们点事

5
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:11,430
It's called tressling.
这叫Tressling

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,160
It combines the physical strength of arm
wrestling with the mental agility of tetris
是一项将掰手腕的体力和
玩俄罗斯方块的

7
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,310
into the ultimate sport.
思维能力集为一体的运动

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,980
Yeah, that's terrific, but what they wanted
me to ask you is to cut it the hell out.
嗯 听起来很厉害
但是她们叫你们快别玩了

9
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,480
Great. Come here, guys. Come on.
很好 来吧 伙计们 来吧

10
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,230
Happy birthday to you
祝你生日快乐

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,350
we might as well stop. It's a stalemate.
我们最好停下吧 陷入平局了

12
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,560
You're beating me in tetris, but you've got
the upper body strength of a keebler elf.
俄罗斯方块上你赢了我
但你的上肢力量就像Keebler饼干玩偶

13
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,770
Keebler elf? I've got your
keebler elf right here.
Keebler玩偶?
让你瞧瞧Keebler玩偶的厉害

14
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,340
okay, it's a stalemate.
好吧 平局

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,530
So, leonard, will we be seeing you on
saturday for your free birthday cheesecake?
那么 Leonard
周六带免费芝士蛋糕去见你?

16
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,140
He can't eat cheesecake.
He's lactose intolerant.
他不能吃芝士蛋糕 他不吃乳糖的

17
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,400
Okay, he can have carrot cake.
好吧 他可以吃胡萝卜蛋糕

18
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,710
What about the cream cheese frosting?
那层奶油干酪怎么办?

19
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,360
He can scrape it off.
可以刮掉嘛

20
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,740
Forget about the cake. How do you
know that my birthday's saturday?
别管蛋糕了 你怎么知道周六是我生日?

21
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,060
I did your horoscope, remember?
我帮你算过星座 记得不?

22
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:05,720
I was going to do everybody's, until sheldon
went on one of his typical psychotic rants.
我本来要帮所有人算的
但Sheldon开始了他的疯言疯语

23
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,750
For the record, "that psychotic rant"
请注意 你所谓的"疯言疯语"

24
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,840
was a concise summation of
the research of bertram forer,
是巴纳姆效应的简明总结

25
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,990
who, in 1948, proved conclusively
through meticulously designed experiments
他在1948年经过精密的设计性实验得出

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,730
that astrology is nothing
but pseudo-scientific hokum.
占星学只不过是一堆伪科学的废话

27
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,380
Blah, blah, blah. Typical taurus.
废话好多 典型的金牛座

28
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,670
So, seriously, are we
going to see you saturday?
说真的 我们周六能见到你吗?

29
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:23,810
Uh, I don't think so.
呃 我不这么认为

30
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,550
Why not?
为什么不?

31
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:25,890
I don't celebrate my birthday.
我不庆祝生日的

32
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,410
Shut up. Yeah, you do.
少来 咋会不庆祝呢

33
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,820
It's no big deal; it's
just the way I was raised.
就是普通日子嘛 我就这么长大的

34
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:32,170
My parents focused on
celebrating achievements,
我父母注重于庆祝巨大成就

35
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:36,000
and being expelled from a birth
canal was not considered one of them.
我从产道里蹦出来对他们来说
并不是什么成就

36
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,010
that's so silly.
这太愚蠢了

37
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,100
Sheldon: It's actually
based on very sound theories.
实际上这基于非常有力的理论

38
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,970
His mother published a paper on it.
他母亲还就此发表了论文

39
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:42,950
Well, what was it called?
哦? 叫什么题目?

40
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,270
"I hate my son and that's
why he can't have cake"?
"我讨厌我儿子 所以他不能吃蛋糕"?

41
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,050
Sheldon: It was obviously effective.
这样做显然很有效果

42
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,430
Leonard grew up to be an
experimental physicist.
Leonard长大成为一个实验物理学家

43
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,080
Perhaps if she'd also denied him
christmas, he'd be a little better at it.
也许 如果她也不让他过圣诞节
他就会比现在更优秀

44
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,930
Thank you.
谢谢你

45
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,450
Well, I love birthdays.
我喜欢过生日

46
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,250
Waking up to mom's special
french toast breakfast,
早上起来吃妈妈特制的法国吐司

47
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,060
wearing the birthday king crown,
playing laser tag with all my friends...
头戴生日王冠
和所有的朋友一起玩激光搏击...

48
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,160
yeah, see? That's what kids should have.
是啊 瞧见没? 孩子就应该这么过

49
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,690
Actually, that was last year.
实际上 说的是我去年的生日

50
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:16,140
So you really never
had a birthday party?
你真的 从来没有 办过生日派对?

51
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,890
No, but it was okay.
没有 不过没关系

52
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,880
I mean, when I was little,
我是指 在我还小的时候

53
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,910
I'd think maybe my parents would change
their mind and surprise me with a party.
我曾想也许我父母会改变主意
然后给我一个惊喜派对

54
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,770
Like this one birthday I
came home from my cello lesson
比如有次生日 我刚学完大提琴回家

55
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,180
and I saw a lot of strange
cars parked out front.
我看到很多陌生车停在门外

56
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,060
When I got to the door, I
could hear people whispering
走到门口 还听见人们在小声说话

57
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:33,260
and I could smell german chocolate
cake, which is my favorite.
而且还闻到了德国巧克力蛋糕的味道
那是我最喜欢的蛋糕

58
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,870
And?
然后呢?

59
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,510
It turns out my grandfather had died.
结果是我爷爷去世了

60
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,420
Oh, my god. That's terrible.
噢 我的天哪 这太恐怖了

61
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,610
Well, it was kind of
like a birthday party.
但我觉得也算个生日派对了

62
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,260
I got to see all my cousins,
and there was cake, so...
我见到了所有的表兄弟 也有蛋糕 所以...

63
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,030
that's the saddest
thing I've ever heard.
这是我听过最可怜的事了

64
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:50,970
You think?
你这么觉得?

65
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,960
Go ahead, tell her
about your senior prom.
来吧 告诉她你的毕业舞会

********Remember--
no peanuts.
一定要记得--不要放花生

70
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,220
Howard, every thai restaurant in
town knows you can't eat peanuts.
Howard 城里每个泰国餐厅
都知道你不能吃花生

71
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:30,460
When they see me coming,
they go, "ah, no-peanut boy!"
他们一看到我去
就会说"啊 不要花生的男孩!"

72
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,710
Hello, penny. Leonard just left.
你好 Penny
Leonard刚刚出门

73
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,580
I know. I want to talk to you.
我知道 我想要跟你谈谈

74
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,670
What would we talk about?
我们谈些什么?

75
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,740
We have no overlapping areas
of interest I'm aware of.
我想 我们还没发现兴趣的交集

76
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,630
As you know, I don't care for chitchat.
你知道的 我不喜欢闲谈

77
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,250
Can you just let me in?
能让我进去吗?

78
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,340
Well, all right, but I don't
see this as a promising endeavor.
好吧 但我不觉得这招管用

79
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:58,840
Okay, here's the deal.
好吧 事情是这样的

80
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:02,020
We are going to throw leonard a kick-ass
surprise party for his birthday on saturday.
我们周六给Leonard办个
超惊喜的生日派对

81
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,310
I hardly think so.
我很难同意

82
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,470
Leonard made it very clear
he doesn't want a party.
Leonard说的很清楚 他不要派对

83
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,040
Did someone say... "party"?
刚才有人说..."派对"?

84
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:12,630
He just doesn't know he wants
one 'cause he's never had one.
他并不知道自己想要
因为他从没有过生日派对

85
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,420
I suppose that's possible,
but for the record,
就算是的 但请注意

86
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,430
I've never had a threesome and
yet I still know I want one.
我从没玩过3P 但我知道我想要

87
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,250
Howard, here's
the difference--
Howard 这两者的区别是--

88
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:26,210
the possibility exists that leonard could
have a birthday party before hell freezes over.
在地狱结冰之前
Leonard过生日派对存在可能性

89
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,370
Fine. If I do have a threesome,
you can't be part of it.
好吧 如果我真的玩3P 你不能参加

90
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,900
I'm just kidding. Yes, you can.
我开玩笑的 你当然能参加了

91
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,350
Can you bring a friend?
能再带个朋友吗?

92
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,750
I think a birthday
party's a terrible idea.
我觉得生日派对是个糟糕的想法

93
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,640
I envy leonard for growing
up without that anguish.
我很羡慕Leonard
成长过程中没有这种痛苦

94
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,420
Anguish?
痛苦?

95
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:49,080
Year after year, I had to
endure wearing comical hats
年复一年 我必须强忍戴上滑稽的帽子

96
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,660
while being forced into the crowded,
sweaty hell of bouncy castles.
被迫挤在人群中 弄得满身大汗

97
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:56,610
Not to mention being blindfolded and being
spun toward a grotesque tailless donkey
更别提要被蒙上眼睛
转着走向那头硕大的无尾驴

98
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,100
as the other children
mocked my disorientation.
走错了方向 更要被其他孩子嘲笑

99
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:05,380
Okay, sweetie, I understand you have
scars that no nonprofessional can heal,
好吧 亲爱的 我知道你心里的伤
一般人治不了

100
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,730
but, nevertheless, we're going
to throw leonard a birthday party.
但我们仍旧要给Leonard办个生日派对

101
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,400
Have I pointed out that I'm
extremely uncomfortable with dancing,
我说过吗? 我极度地不喜欢跳舞

102
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,880
loud music and most other forms
of alcohol-induced frivolity?
还包括吵闹的音乐
以及大多数人在酒后的轻佻行为

103
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,120
Nevertheless, we're...
虽然如此 我们...

104
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,080
- in addition, I really don't think that leonard wants...
- okay, here's the deal:
- 而且 我觉得Leonard才不会希望...
- 好吧 这样如何:

105
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,560
You either you help me throw leonard
a birthday party or, so help me god,
你要么帮我给Leonard
办一个生日派对 否则

106
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:24,290
I will go in youour droom and unbag all of
your most valuable, mint-condition comic books.
我会到你的卧室里把你最珍贵的
完好无损的漫画书统统倒出

107
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,620
And on one of them-- t u won'yoknow
which-- I'll draw a tiny happy face in ink.
在其中任选你不知道的一页--
用墨水在上面画个迷你笑脸

108
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,570
You can't do that. If you make a mark in
a mint comic book, it's no longer mint.
你不能那么干 你在完好无损的书上
做记号 那就不再是完好无损了

109
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,240
Sheldon, do you understand
the concept of blackmail?
Sheldon 你脑里有勒索这个概念吗?

110
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,630
Well, of course, I... oh.
当然 我...噢

111
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,390
Yeah, I have an idea.
对 我有办法了

112
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,740
Let's throw leonard a
kick-ass birthday party.
我们给Leonard办个
超赞的生日派对

113
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,910
that's not the secret knock.
暗号不对

114
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,500
This is the secret knock.
看我的正确演示

115
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,720
what difference does it make?
有什么不同的效果呢?

116
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:17,940
The whole point of a secret knock
is to establish a non-verbal signal
暗号的精髓就在于
建立一种非言语的暗号

117
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,180
to verify the identity
of one's co-conspirators.
用于查证同谋们的身份

118
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,200
Penny: Is that raj and howard?
是Raj和Howard?

119
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,740
Possibly, but unverified.
有可能 查证中

120
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,250
Will you just let us in.
还打算让我们进去吗

121
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,310
Luckily for you, this
is not a nuclear reactor.
你们很幸运
我们不是在搞核反应堆

whereas you know what you need.
实际上你自己最清楚你需要什么

那么 我何不将事情简单化--
直接给你50美元不就行了

me $50 on my birthday,
今后我的生日
你也可以送我50美元嘛

leaving the other one old and $50 richer.

And I ask you, is it worth it?

non-optional social convention.
