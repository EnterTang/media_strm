75
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,290

Marquez? You Eddie Marquez's Kid?

94
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,800
I Worked With Him In The 4-4.

95
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,270
He's A Real Putz.

96
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,560
Worked With Your Brother In Bronx Narcotics A Couple Of Years Ago.

97
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,270
He's A Putz,Too. Hope It's Not Genetic.

98
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,980
As A Matter Of Fact, It Is.

00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,490
I Guess Not.

104
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,210
When I Got This Assignment, I Asked Around About You.

105
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,310
You Know What I Heard?

106
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,600

No Sign Of Forced Entry.

110
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,540
Could Be Someone She Knew. Neighbors Hear Or See Anything?

111
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,070

I'll Go Talk To 'Em.

113
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,210

00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:56,790
Second Week, You Hate My Guts.

117
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,200
Third Week,You Put In For A Transfer.

118
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,380
So Why Don't You Just Save Yourself Some Time-

119
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,670
And Miss The Foreplay?

120
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,200
No Way.

121
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,780
My Name Is Eva.

122
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,570
Marquez.

123
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,460
????

124
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:50,870
Excuse Me.

125
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,330
Woman: Hey!

126
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,190
Eddie?

127
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,500
Don't Do This,Man. I Don't Want To Have To Shoot You.

128
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,150
Then Don't. It Hurts Like Hell.

129
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,370
I Didn't Kill Her,Ok?

130
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,350
Yeah? Where'd The Blood Come From?

131
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,250
What's Her Name,Eddie?

132
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,190
Get On The Ground,Now!

133
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,390
I Know How To Use This Thing.

134
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,400
Last Time I Was Shot,

135
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,860
It Was With A Hopkins And Allen,Xl Number 6 Pocket.

136
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,240
Now,Get On The Ground!

137
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:16,030
Now,Those Days,Bullets Didn't Have Copper Jackets,

138
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,980
So It Was Like Pouring Hot Water Through Your Veins.

139
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,940
Are You Crazy?

140
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,220
Woman: I'm A Doctor.

141
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,540
He's Still Asystole.

142
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,440
1,2,3,

143
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,760
4,5,6,

144
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,780
7,8,9.

145
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,250
One More Time. Ok,Clear.

146
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,270
What You Done To Me?

147
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,680
You Will Not Grow Old.

148
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,630
You Will Not Die...

149
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,460
Until You Find The One,

150
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,250
And Your Souls Are Wed.

151
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,300
Ok.

152
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,970
Let's Call It.

153
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,290
What's The Time?

154
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,760
John: Trust Me-

155
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,180
All Of It Gets Old.

156
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,000
John: Except Me.

157
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,430
How Long Have We Known Each Other?

158
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,910
Long Enough To Know Better.

159
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,260
You Know The Answer. Why Do You Ask Me That?

160
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,210
Do I Look Different To You?

161
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,470
You Could Use A Shave.

162
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,960
Look Closer.

163
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,790
You Look,Uh...

164
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,420
Happy.

165
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,920
I Almost Died.

166
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,140
Hey,Let The Good Times Roll.

167
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:14,270
My Heart Exploded Chasing Some Guy On The Subway.

168
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,090
But That Can't Happen, Not To You.

169
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,000
There's Always A First Time.

170
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,920
Oh,Boy.

171
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:23,240
I Think She Was There. Who?

172
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,110
The One.

173
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,200
The One Who'll Make Me Old Like You.

174
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,800
I Never Did Like That Idea.

175
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,920
You Meet Your True Love And Then Die.

176
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,050
Doesn't Sound Too Romantic To Me.

177
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,080
How Do You Know She Was There?

178
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,460
Well,The Shaman Told Me I'd Feel It Here,In My Heart.

179
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:36,980
Well,Maybe The Shaman Was Wrong.

180
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,870
Maybe It Was Just Last Night's Chinese.

181
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,830
You Don't Know. It Ain't Exactly Science.

182
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,640
This Was Like Nothing I've Ever Felt!

183
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,840
Look,You Just Had A Heart Attack And Didn't Die.

184
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,770
Now,I Thought When You Met The Right One,

185
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,610
You Were Supposed To Become Mortal-

186
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,050
Only After Our Souls Are United.

187
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,550
What The Hell Does That Mean?

188
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,890
After You Kissed Her, After You Slept With Her?

189
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,020
After You've Done Lamaze Class-

190
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,090
They Didn't Give An Instruction Manual,Ok?

191
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,510
I Didn't Exactly Meet Her.

192
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,790
I Was Too Busy Trying To Breathe.

193
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,060
So You Don't Even Know Who She Is.

194
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:10,190
I Know She Was There. I Know She Exists.

195
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,060
That's Enough.

196
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,370
Not For You.

197
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,280
You're Gonna Try To Find Her.

198
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,240
And When You Don't Find Her, You're Gonna Get Crazy.

199
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,140
And Last Time You Got Crazy,

200
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:22,840
It Was A Long Damn 10 Years.

201
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,040
Omar...

202
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,310
I Know This Is Hard For You.

203
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,720
No,I'm Happy For You,Man.

204
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,460
Inside,I'm Doing The Camel Walk.

205
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:36,670
But This Is A Good Thing.

206
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,590
I've Been Waiting Centuries For This.

207
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,620
If I Can Find Her, It'll All Have Value.

208
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,900
Time...

209
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,340
Will Have Value.

210
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,970
Oh,Dr. Dillane.

211
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,630
Hey,Uh,We Have A Problem?

212
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,000
We,Or You?

213
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,120
Remember That M.I. You Brought In Yesterday?

214
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,140
Yeah. The One With The Scars.

215
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,120
Did You Ever Get His Name?

216
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,860
No,But That's Not It.

217
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,790
Um,He's Disappeared.

218
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,640
He Was Dead.

219
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,820
Yeah,I Know.

220
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:24,810
Like I Said, We Have A Problem.

221
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,010
John: You're In My Chair.

222
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,540
Probably Because I'm Sitting At Your Desk.

223
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:35,580
I Can See We Already Progressed To The Next Stage Of Our Relationship.

224
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,050
I Don't Hate You, Amsterdam.

225
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,270
That Would Take Too Much Effort.

226
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,990
Good. Today's A Whole New Day.

227
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,640
Missing Persons?

228
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,380
Fingerprints, Crime Scene Reports.

229
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,690
It's Called Police Work.

230
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,990
Someone Needs To Do It.

231
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,820
She's Not A Missing Person.

232
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,730
How Do You Know That?

233
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,910
Her Boyfriend Told Me.

234
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,160
We Had A Little Heart To Heart In The Subway.

235
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,550
His Name's Eddie Riley.

236
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,110
Yeah,He's A Primary Subject. When'd You Bring Him In?

237
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,930
I Didn't.

238
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,880
He Give You Her Name?

239
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,440
He Had A Train To Catch.

240
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,450
Look,Don't Be Cute. She Deserves Better.

241
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,720
Yeah,You're Absolutely Right.

242
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,840
Where You Going?

243
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,710
Police Work. Someone Needs To Do It.

244
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,660
Look,We Need To Set Some Ground Rules Here.

245
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:18,150
You Sound Just Like My Last 609 Girlfriends.

246
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,950
I Hate That Smell.

247
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,330
If Dead Bodies Make You Queasy,

248
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,130
What Are You Doing In Homicide?

249
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,440
Wasn't My Choice.

250
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,050
I Wanted To Work Undercover Narcotics,

251
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,860
But The Powers That Be Refused My Application.

252
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,190
And Dead Bodies Don't Make Me Queasy.

253
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:36,080
I Just Can't Stand The Smell Of Formaldehyde,Ok?

254
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:37,720
Coroner: She Have A Name?

255
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:38,940
John: Yeah,We Just Don't Know It.

256
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,700
Well,The Bullet Perforated The Right Brachio-Cophalic Vein

257
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,760
And The Internal Uhoracic!Artery.

258
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,260
Oh. What Caliber?

259
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,100
Maybe A.38, Close Range.

260
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,240
She Has Some Random Contusions,Defensive Marks.

261
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,240
I Also Found What Looks Like Paint Underneath Her Fingernails.

262
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,280
Sent It Over To The Lab.

263
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,500
See If It Matches Anything Over

264
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,930
At The S.O.C. - Any Chance The Body Was Moved?

265
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:00,490
Lividity Is Inconclusive.

266
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,480
I'm Sorry. I Have A New Baby.

267
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,930
You Need A Deep Male Voice.

268
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,060
Try Putting On Npr At 10:00.

269
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,230
Cool. Baby Sleeps,And Brushes Up On Foreign Affairs.

270
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,670
I Like That.

271
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,030
Then There's This.

272
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,180
The Penmar.

273
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,630
An Underground Club.

274
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,930
You Knew About This How?

275
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,930
It Used To Be A Speakeasy During Prohibition.

276
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:32,990
Same Name,Same Spot.

277
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,080
Nypd.

278
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,530
We're Trying To Id A Young Woman.

279
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:39,060
She Had The Club Stamp On Her Wrist.

280
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,300
Lots Of Girls Come In Here.

281
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,590
Any That Look Like This?

282
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,660
Whoa...

283
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,650
What Happened To Her?

284
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,340
That's What We Want To Know.

285
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,190
Hold On A Sec.

286
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:51,070
You Knew About This Being A Speakeasy,How?

287
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,100
I Used To Drink Here.

288
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,300
I Think Your Dead Girl Is Like Some Wannabe Celebutant.

289
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,670
Chloe Carlton.

290
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,260
She's The One.

291
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,790
Shaman: In All Of Time,

292
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:16,330
There Is Only One Person You Were Meant To Be With.

293
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,450
We Feel This.

294
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,310
We Know It.

295
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:24,520
But We Do Not Know How To Find The One.

296
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,560
What Was So Important?

297
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,190
The Y Is Supposed To Be Closed.

298
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,610
It Is.

299
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,380
And You're Naked.

300
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,650
Right Again.

301
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,370
Surveillance From Chloe's Bank.

302
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,110
She Withdrew 10k From Her Account

303
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,200
The Morning She Was Murdered.

304
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,810
That's The Guy I Chased. Eddie Riley.

305
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:18,300
Santori's Put A Wan Card Out On Him.

306
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:21,250
She Also Deposited A Check For The Same Amount

307
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,320
From A Pawn Broker 6 Days Ago.

308
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,150
Only Question Is...

309
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,140
What Is She Selling?

310
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,850
Great Thing About New York-

311
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,460
Pawn Shops Are Open All Night.

312
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,380
Why Narcotics?

313
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,520
Most Cops Would Kill To Get Into Homicide.

314
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,330
It's After The Fact.

315
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:46,530
Digging Through The Past Isn't Going To Bring Anyone Back.

316
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,810
I'd Rather Be On The Front Lines.

317
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,790
Why Homicide?

318
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:55,680
I Like To Solve Puzzles.

319
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,260
And It Intrigues Me.

320
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,920
What Does?

321
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,830
Death.

322
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,470
Likes To Play Hard To Get.

323
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,170
I'll See You Tomorrow.

324
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,760
You Have A Good Energy About You,Eva.

325
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,170
It's True.

326
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,540
I Felt I Should Say Something Nice.

327
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,870
So There It Is.

328
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,100
Best Yankee Pitcher In History,Guidry.

329
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,340
Gossage,The Goose.

330
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,640
Guidry Won A Cy Young Award.

331
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,390
25 And 3 In '78.

332
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,200
Red Ruffing.

333
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:32,300
What Do You Know About It?

334
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,360
I Know His Curve Ball Dropped Like It Fell Off A Table.

335
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,560
All You Could Do Is Wave At It.

336
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,510
Hey,Lone Ranger,You Know That Guy You Let Get Away?

337
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,030
Eddie Riley? Before He Went Into The Army,

338
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,820
He Was No Stranger To The System.

339
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,220
G.L.A.,Burglary,Assault.

340
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,250
Not Murder. You Want To Up Your Clearance Rate

341
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:48,550
Until We Nail The Right Guy.

342
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,100
If They're Innocent, They Don't Run.

343
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,040
Riley's Our Boy.

344
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,900
And When I Find Him, He Won't Get Away.

345
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,810
He's Right,You Know.

346
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,190
All Signs Point To Eddie.

347
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,610
He Could Have Shot Me. He Didn't.

348
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,920
I Saw It In His Eyes, He's Not A Killer.

349
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,480
What'd You Find?

350
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,500
Pawn Shop Keeps A Photo Log. This Is What Chloe Sold,

351
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,120
Vintage,Deco-Style, Platinum And Diamonds.

352
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:12,380
Bezel And Bead-Set Stones.

353
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,150
Could Be 4.5 Carats.

354
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,980
You Learn That From One Of Your 609 Girlfriends?

355
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,490
One Of My Wives.

356
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,160
Plural. How Many Have You Had?

357
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,490
Only One At A Time.

358
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,000
No Way Eddie Gave Her This.

359
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,210
I'd Like To Know Who Did.

360
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,150
Hello?

361
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,060
Mrs. Carlton?

362
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,060
I'm Detective Amsterdam,

363
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,380
This Is Detective Marquez.

364
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,600
We're Sorry About Your Loss.

365
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,130
Get Out.

366
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,030
Please.

367
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,650
We Know How Hard This Must Be For You.

368
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:59,190
You Know Nothing. You're A Child. I Have Work To Do.

369
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,390
We Need Your Help,Mrs. Carlton. We Need It Now,

370
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,550
Because I'm Not Letting Whoever Did This Walk Away.

371
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:07,080
Will That Bring Her Back?

372
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,610
She Was My Heart.

373
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,070
You Have No Idea What I'm Feeling.

374
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:16,240
It's Just Words Until It's Happened To You.

375
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,540
He Was 6,My Son.

376
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,560
Well,Almost 6.

377
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,210
It's Pain Without End.

378
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:47,020
Do You Know Who Gave Chloe This Bracelet?

379
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,490
She Ran With A Rich Crowd.

380
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,970
Dated Toby Hardwick For A While.

381
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,170
Hardwick. As In Hardwick Hotels?

382
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,000
Never Liked Him Much.

383
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:02,250
A Rich Boy Through And Through.

384
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,280
Broke Up A Couple Months Ago.

385
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,170
Any Idea Why?

386
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:07,700
She'd Met Someone New.

387
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,470
Eddie Riley.

388
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:16,100
She Said They Had Something Real.

389
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:21,630
And Now She's Gone.

390
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:29,700
How Do I Go On?

391
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,020
Thanks.

392
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,220
Right Here.

393
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,100
Mr. Hardwick?

394
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,290
Excuse Me A Moment.

395
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,200
Hi,You Must Be Detectives...

396
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,560
Amsterdam And Marquez.

397
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,670
Pleasure. Let's Step Over Here For A Moment.

398
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:45,880
Thanks For Coming Out Here.

399
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,480
We Have Preliminary Inspections All Week.

400
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,550
Another Hotel?

401
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,280
Low-Cost Housing For 300 Families.

402
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:55,660
With Dreams Comes Responsibilities.

403
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,620
So,How Can I Help You?

404
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,550
Chloe Was A Good Friend Of Our Family.

405
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,920
We Haven't Been Able To Contact Your Son.

406
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,260
Toby? He's On A Skiing Trip.

407
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:04,490
He'll Be Back For The Funeral.

408
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:05,650
How Long Has He Been Gone?

409
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:07,860
A Couple Of Days. Why?

410
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,280
He's Not A... Suspect,Is He?

411
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,400
What Can You Tell Us About Your Son's Relationship With Chloe?

412
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:14,380
They Went Out For A While.

413
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,320
Nothing Very Serious,I Don't Think.

414
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:19,560
Who Would Have Given Her A $10,000 Diamond Bracelet?

415
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,730
I Don'u Know.

416
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,880
That's A Lot Of Money.

417
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,770
I Suppose My Son Is Very Spoiled,

418
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,350
My Fault.

419
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,870
We Work To Give Them Everything,

420
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,090
And Then They Don't Know What To Do With It.

421
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,800
Look,Toby May Be Many Things,

422
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,840
Some Of Them Not Very Attractive,

423
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,990
But He Is Not A Killer.

424
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,950
Madagascar Red,

425
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,820
Manufactured In Italy Until The 1940s.

426
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,690
This Is What Was Found Under The Victim's Fingernails.

427
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,550
Artist-Grade Paint,

428
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,940
Banned For Its Toxic Lead Content.

429
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,730
But What's Revealing Is The Medium Used.

430
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,890
The Artist Added Water-Washed Linseed Oil Laced With Gold Leaf.

431
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,720
Gold Leaf? It Was A Marker.

432
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,270
An Artist's Unique Signature.

433
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:04,490
Can You Date It?

434
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:07,060
Based On The Molecular Deterioration,

435
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,900
I Would Say 1930s.

436
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,320
So If Chloe Scratched A Painting Before She Died,

437
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,040
Then She Probably Wasn't Killed At Eddie's.

438
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,910
No Madagascar Red There.

439
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,110
That Means The Body Was Moved,Maybe By Eddie.

440
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,650
Or Someone Who Wanted To Frame Him.

441
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:21,300
That Painting Could Be Anywhere.

442
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,670
It's Gonna Be A Very Cold Trail.

443
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,780
Not If You Know The Painter.

444
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,070
My Mother Seldom Worked On Canvass.

445
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:34,150
She Was More Known For Her Onsite Murals.

446
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:37,030
She Painted Them All Over New York-

447
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,180
Private Homes,Hotels,

448
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,600
Libraries.

449
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:44,180
They Called Her One Of The First Graffiti Artists.

450
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,450
The Paint Really Does Shimmer.

451
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,250
That Is What Made Her Work Unique,

452
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:49,480
She Mixed It With Gold.

453
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:50,930
Did She Keep Any Records?

454
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:54,330
She Was An Artist, Not A Bookkeeper.

455
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:57,130
But You Could Try Asking Her.

456
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,070
I Thought Your Mother Passed Away.

457
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,050
No, She's Still Here.

458
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,590
Sometimes,That Is.

459
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,770
The Alzheimer's Plays Havoc.

460
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,230
Hello,Julianne.

461
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,030
Hmm?

462
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,610
I Wanted To Ask You About Your Work.

463
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,330
You've Seen It.

464
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:26,390
Oh,Many Times.

465
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:30,010
You Used A Pigment Called Madagascar Red.

466
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,060
Did I?

467
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:35,520
I Remember Alizarin Crimson,

468
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,350
Such A Lovely Color.

469
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:40,390
What About Madagascar Red?

470
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,860
It's-It's So Long Ago.

471
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:45,790
It Might Have Been For A Special Commission.

472
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,570
Please,Julianne.

473
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,620
It's Important.

474
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,490
Yes.

475
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,900
<I>For The Lover's Sacrifice.</I>

476
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,040
I Painted That Mural, You Know.

477
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,600
I Know,I Know.

478
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,390
Where Did You Paint It,Julianne?

479
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,240
They Won't Let Me Take Walks Anymore. They...

480
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:10,330
They're Worried I'll Forget My Way Home.

481
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,470
Sometimes It's Better To Forget.

482
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:20,500
But You Remember Your Work,Don't You?

483
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:32,700
Do I Know You?

484
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,830
Not Anymore.

485
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,920
She Painted The Mural In The Presidential Suite

486
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,400
Of The Davenshire Hotel.

487
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,460
The Eavenshire?

488
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,760
Sold In The Eighties To Hardwick Hotels.

489
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,870
Toby Hardwick Had Access, But Motive?

490
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:53,860
We Need Evidence.

491
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:54,960
We Have To Get Into That Suite.

492
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:57,180
I'll Get A Warrant.

493
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:55,460
Julianne: Charlie?

494
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:01,130
You Think I Wouldn't Remember You?

495
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,640
You Think I Wouldn't Remember What We Had?

496
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,660
I'm So Sorry. This Happens Sometimes.

497
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,750
It's Ok. Let Her Be.

498
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:11,040
One Day You Left.

499
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:13,310
You Just Left.

500
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:16,880
I Gave Up So Much For You.

501
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,730
Didn't I Mean Anything?

502
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:23,870
The Thing Of It Is,

503
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:27,610
I Knew You Were Going To Leave Me.

504
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:31,320
I Knew It The First Day We Met.

505
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:58,160
Ever Ask Yourself Why A Vampire Has No Reflection In A Mirror?

506
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,830
Not This Week.

507
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,020
It'd Be Too Painful.

508
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:06,710
To See Himself Year After Year,

509
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,210
Century After Century,

510
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:12,530
Unchanged While Everything Around Him Grows Old.

511
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:18,860
To Search For Love But Know It's Always Just Out Of Your Reach.

512
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:22,400
Because To Be Human Is To Die.

513
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:25,450
To Die Is What Makes Life Worth Living.

514
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,670
It's God's Joke.

515
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,650
What About The Girl In The Subway?

516
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:36,580
There Were Probably A Couple Hundred Women On That Platform.

517
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,360
Maybe She Was The One, Maybe Not.

518
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,720
Maybe She Was On Her Way To The Airport And Is Long Gone.

519
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,590
It's All Maybes.

520
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:53,220
Maybe It's A Sign That I'll Never Find Her.

521
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,930
Your Desk Is Done.

522
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:26,060
Newly Painted.

523
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,080
The Killer's Standing Here.

524
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,300
There's A Struggle,

525
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,580
He Hits Her,

526
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:33,340
She Falls Against The Wall Here.

527
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:36,290
Shouldn't We Wait For Crime Scene?

528
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:38,710
Absolutely.

529
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,050
Got The Blood Work Back On Your Disappearing Corpse,

530
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:43,270
And It's A Mess.

531
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,240
Hmm.

532
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,950
No,This Must Be A Lab Error.

533
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,670
These Numbers Don't Make Sense.

534
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,470
I Mean,The Hemoglobin Level's Over The Moon.

535
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,900
120 Micros Of Lead?

536
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:54,090
That's Enough To Kill Someone.

537
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,370
Yeah,And Check Out The Blood Type.

538
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:57,480
It's This Rare Form Of Rzrz.

539
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:01,160
It Became Extinct When Certain Native American Tribes Disappeared.

540
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:03,350
So,Somebody's Pulling Our Chain?

541
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,360
Hope So.

542
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,500
Ok,But How Did Toby Remove The Body?

543
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,870
I Mean,There Must Be Security Cameras Everywhere.

544
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,950
You Know...

545
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:27,290
This Guy Kind Of Looks Like You.

546
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:29,130
You Think?

547
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,880
What The Hell?

548
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,160
It Was Common For Turn Of The Century Hotels

549
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,220
To Build Secret Entrances To Their Best Suite.

550
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:45,640
Toby Could Have Known About This.

551
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,180
Took A Chance.

552
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,290
That's Years Of Bad Luck.

553
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:52,180
Only 7.

554
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:55,330
Let's Bring Him In.

555
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:56,800
No! Ok.

556
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,020
Ok,There's No Way I Reserved That Room.

557
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,140
You're Name's On The Register,

558
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,750
You've Partied There Before. Come On,Toby!

559
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,180
I Don't Care, I Wasn't There.

560
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:06,340
There's No Way That You Can Prove That I Was.

561
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,170
Man: That's Enough.

562
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:09,540
Counselor.

563
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,600
Mr. Hardwick Is My Client.

564
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,950
I Suggest That If You Intend To Charge Him,

565
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,060
You Do So.

566
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:16,170
Otherwise He's Leaving With Me.

567
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,650
I Don't Need Someone To Talk For Me.

568
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:19,420
I'm Not 5 Years Old. Be Quiet,Toby.

569
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:22,260
Look,There's No Way I Could Have Killed Chloe.

570
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:23,290
She's My Friend.

571
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:25,030
You Were Jealous Because She Met Someone Else.

572
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,770
Yes,I Love Her, But Not Like That.

573
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,720
Well,Then How?

574
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:30,980
You Don't Strike Me As The Platonic Type.

575
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:37,670
My Father's Here, Isn't He?

576
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:40,260
Is He-Is He Watching?

577
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,490
Toby.

578
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,980
What If I Could Prove That I Wasn't At The Hotel That Night?

579
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,400
You Don't Need To Say Anything.

580
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,370
I'm In Love With Someone Else.

581
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,490
I Was With That Person The Night That Chloe Was Killed.

582
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:55,160
Yeah? We Need Her Name.

583
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,840
I Can't Do That.

584
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,760
You Can If It's True.

585
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,310
Ok.

586
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:13,000
His Name Is Brian Shaw.

587
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,410
I Guess We All Have Secrets.

588
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:24,640
That's What Keeps Us In Business.

589
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:31,030
What Do You Think His Father's Saying To Him?

590
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,660
He's Telling Him He Loves Him.

591
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,930
Aw,A Romantic.

592
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:35,780
I Can Read Lips.

593
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,560
And You're Also Deaf,I Suppose.

594
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,110
It Was Temporary. Normandy.

595
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:42,700
A Shell Exploded Too Close To Comfort.

596
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:45,030
Sorry I Asked.

597
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,100
Talked To Toby Hardwick's Boyfriend

598
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,380
And Verified His Alibi.

599
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:52,540
I Told You, Eddie Riley's Our Guy.

600
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,940
Don't Take It Too Hard,Hotshot.

601
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:58,220
Even Red Ruffing Lost A Few.

602
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:57,320
I Just Heard From Mcmanus.

603
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,270
He Found Eddie At The Penmar.

604
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:01,620
Turns Out His Brother-In-Law Runs The Place.

605
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,460
He's Been Hiding Out There.

606
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,360
Santori's On His Way To Pick Him Up.

607
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,850
Get In.

608
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:10,560
What Happened?

609
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,430
Tried To Run.

610
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,850
Guess He Thought If It Worked Once,It'd Work Again.

611
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:15,870
It Didn't.

612
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:16,980
He'll Be All Right.

613
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,690
Found This On Him- A.38.

614
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:19,940
John: Nice Work,Tony.

615
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,760
Brought This One Home.

616
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,670
I've Been Doing This A Long Time.

617
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,140
You Got Good Instincts,John,

618
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:27,750
But Sometimes Uhings Are What They Seem.

619
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:29,680
Thanks.

620
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:31,750
That's A Good Lesson.

621
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:34,340
You Didn't Buy A Word Of That.

622
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,820
Not True.

623
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,810
He Said I Have Good Instincts.

624
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:39,690
What Do Your Instincts Tell You Now?

625
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,020
Same As Before.

626
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,430
Eddie Didn't Kill That Girl.

627
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,240
But If He's Innocent, Why Did He Run?

628
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,550
Why Didn't He Give Himself Up?

629
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,820
He Comes Home, Finds Chloe's Body.

630
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:49,950
He Tries To Save Her, Gets Blood All Over Him.

631
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,220
The Cops Show Up.

632
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:52,800
He Knows What It'll Look Like.

633
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,040
He Has A Record, Body's In His Place.

634
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,570
Now,Who's Gonna Believe Him?

635
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,320
So He Picks Up The Gun And Runs.

636
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,710
Then Who Did It?

637
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,530
The Only Other Person With Access To The Suite,

638
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:04,840
The Only Person Who Would Have Known About The Secret Entrance.

639
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,290
Peter Hardwick?

640
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:08,970
Interesting Theory,But It Would Help To Have A Motive.

641
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,090
It's More Than A Theory.

642
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,500
Hardwick Was Having An Affair With Chloe.

643
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,700
How Do You Know That?

644
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,440
His Son Implicated Him.

645
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,520
When? I Was There,I Didn't Hear Him Say That.

646
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,830
I Didn't Say I Heard Him.

647
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:27,790
I'm Not Sure Lip Reading's Exactly Admissible.

648
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,530
Hey,Eddie.

649
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,430
You're The Dude Who Chased Me.

650
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:42,260
I Thought You Were Dead.

651
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,570
I Was. Now I'm Not.

652
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:46,100
Lucky Me.

653
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,780
I Don't Want To Face Another Murder Charge.

654
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,740
I Don't Think You Killed Her,Eddie.

655
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:53,340
I Think You Loved Her.

656
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:55,540
You Ever Been In Love?

657
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:57,340
I've!Loved.

658
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,010
I'm Talking About Something Else.

659
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,050
I'm Talking About...

660
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,100
Feeling Like You're Drowning When She's Not There.

661
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,410
Did You Ever Feel That?

662
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,350
No.

663
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,300
Well, That's What We Had.

664
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:20,030
You Know Who Killed Her,Eddie.

665
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,400
But You Don't Trust The System.

666
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:23,070
You Think The Game's Rigged,Right?

667
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,520
Yeah,Well,I'm Here, Aren't I?

668
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,260
Well,Too Bad You Won't Have The Chance

669
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,370
To Do Something About It.

670
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:31,830
Doctor Said You're Well Enough

671
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,950
To Be Transferred To Central Booking.

672
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:37,060
Put On Your Pants.

673
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:39,820
Hey,Spare 2 Bucks?

674
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,380
Talk About Inflation. Sorry,Buddy.

675
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,130
How About 3 Bucks?

676
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:47,980
Keys.

677
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,520
You Don't Want To Do This. Shut Up!

678
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,530
Cuffs And Car. Come On,Come On,Come On.

679
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,390
Been A While Since We Did Something Like This.

680
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,050
It Feels Good.

681
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:11,450
Ok,Let's See Where He Takes Us.

682
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,790
What Are You Doing? What Do You Want?

683
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:18,580
Do You Know Who I Am?

684
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:19,500
Yes,I Do. Yes,I Do.

685
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,050
You're Eddie,Eddie Riley. Yeah?

686
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:21,690
Eddie,Listen To Me. That's Right/

687
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:22,780
Listen To Me Very Carefully.

688
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,460
I'm A Very Rich Man. I Can Do Things For You.

689
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,170
What Can You Do For Me? Can You Bring Chloe Back?

690
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,270
Eddie- Shut Up!

691
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:37,260
Eddie,Please. Please, Can We Just Talk?

692
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:38,510
Shut Up! Shut Up!

693
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,850
Get Down On Your Knees! Ok,Ok.

694
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,710
Get Down On Your Knees!

695
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,050
Please,I'll Give You Anything You Want.

696
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:44,180
What Are You Gonna Give Me? What?

697
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,240
Like The Bracelet That You Gave Her?

698
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:46,870
She Hated It! She Hated It!

699
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,710
It Was A Handcuff. Admit It.

700
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,260
Look At Me! Admit It.

701
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,400
I Want To Hear You Say It.

702
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:52,950
I Swear It Was An Accident.

703
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:54,590
She Said She Was Gonna Leave Me.

704
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,650
And Then Things Just Got Out Of Control.

705
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:58,460
I'm Sorry. So You Shot Her,

706
00:36:58,610 --> 00:36:59,800
And You Dumped Her Body In My Apartment

707
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,870
Like She Was Trash?!

708
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,640
It Just Went Off. Eddie,Please.

709
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,640
Eddie.

710
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,860
Put It Down.

711
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:12,440
The Gun's Empty.

712
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,440
It's Over.

713
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:21,700
No One Gets To Die Today.

714
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:30,530
Thought You Were Gonna Wait For Me.

715
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:34,210
Yeah,I Lied.

716
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,740
You-You Didn't Have To Come.

717
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,900
Actually,I Did.

718
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:58,220
I,Uh,Thought You Might Want This.

719
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:03,440
Yow Asked Before How You Go On.

720
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:05,630
You Do What You Can.

721
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:07,260
You Go To Work, You See Your Friends,

722
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:12,300
You Cook Food, Get Up In The Morning.

723
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:18,030
Aod One Day,It Changes.

724
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:21,820
Don't Know Why, It Just Does.

725
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,000
It's Definitely An Original Benwaar.

726
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,260
And In Impeccable Shape.

727
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,350
May I Ask Where You Found It?

728
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,020
Goodwill.

729
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,760
Then You're The Luckiest Man Alive.

730
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:42,270
Tell That To My Bookie.

731
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,160
How's 15,000?

732
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:47,610
Bout This Benwaar Fellow,

733
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:51,090
I Did A Little Research On Him On The Internet.

734
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,620
His Last Desk Sold At Auction

735
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:56,650
For 87,000.

736
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:58,800
I Could Go To 60.

737
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,390
Done.

738
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:03,160
Thing About Great Art,

739
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,980
It's Timeless.

740
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,940
It's As If The Artist

741
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:12,010
Was Speaking To Us Today.

742
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,000
Smoke?

743
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,380
Oh,I'll Pass.

744
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,540
Sure?

745
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,980
It's Afzal Molasses Tobacco Infused With Peach Resin.

746
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:26,550
That Stuff Will Kill You.

747
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:30,830
Mcmanus Told Me What Happened To Your Last Partner.

748
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:32,110
Said You Had A Death Wish.

749
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,360
Really?

750
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:37,620
If We're Gonna Be Working Together,

751
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,240
We Have To Trust Each Other.

752
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,840
You Don't Need To Worry About That.

753
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:43,160
You Won't Be Herelong.

754
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:45,970
Your Application To Narcotics Wasn't Denied.

755
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,520
Your Father Buried It.

756
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,470
He Wanted To Protect You.

757
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:52,040
You Can Reapply In 3 Months.

758
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:53,220
I Will.

759
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,030
And You'll Get In.

760
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,780
But Why?

761
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,780
Who Are You Trying To Impress?

762
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:02,320
Only You,Amsterdam.

763
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:04,740
You Don't Need To.

764
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:14,280
How Did You Find Out About This Stuff?

765
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,900
It's What We Do.

766
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,970
We Bring Closure To People Who Need It.

767
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:20,120
You Seem To Need It.

768
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,750
Closure.

769
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:25,850
It's What We All Want.

770
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,380
* Burn It Down *

771
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:35,620
* Till The Embers Smoke On The Ground *

772
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:39,970
* And Start New *

773
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:44,270
* When Your Heart Is An Empty Room *

774
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:49,150
* With Walls Of The Deepest Blue *

775
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:57,130
* Home's Face *

776
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,420
* How It Ages When You're Away *

777
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:05,650
* Spring Blooms *

778
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:09,900
* And You Find The Love That's True *

779
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:14,170
* But You Don't Know What Now To Do *

780
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:18,520
* 'Cause The Chase Is All You Know *

781
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:23,190
* And She Stopped Running Months Ago *

782
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,350
* And All You See *

783
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,710
* Is Where Else You Could Be *

784
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:36,160
* When You're At Home *

785
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:42,030
* And Out On The Street *

786
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:44,780
You Will Not Grow Old.

787
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:46,890
You Will Not Die...

788
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:50,450
Until You Find The One

789
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:53,270
And Your Souls Are Wed.

790
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,210
How Will I Know When I Find Her?

791
00:41:57,370 --> 00:42:00,700
You Will Feel It,Here...

792
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,150
In Your Heart.

793
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:09,910
*But You Shed Not A Single Tear *

794
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:14,140
* For The Things That You Didn't Need *

795
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:20,030
* 'Cause You Knew You Were Finally Free *

796
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:24,680
* 'Cause All You See *

797
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:28,500
* Is Where Else You Could Be *

798
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:31,910
* When You're At Home *

799
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:37,660
* And Out On The Street *

800
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:41,170
* Are So Many Possibilities *

801
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:45,100
* To Not Be Alone *

802
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:50,630

00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:03,490

00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:06,200
* Are So Many Possibilities... *
