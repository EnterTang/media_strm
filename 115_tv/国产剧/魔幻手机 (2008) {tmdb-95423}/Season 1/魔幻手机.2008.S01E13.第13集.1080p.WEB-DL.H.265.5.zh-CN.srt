1
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:05,100
在传说中的时代里
In a land of myth and a time of magic,

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,931
王国的命运
the destiny of a great kingdom

3
00:00:06,931 --> 00:00:09,973
肩负在一个年轻男孩的身上
rests on the shoulders of a young boy.

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:13,370
他的名字...梅林
His name...Merlin

5
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,470
梅林! 矛
Merlin! Spear.

6
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,013
天生就这么一无是处 梅林?
Do you have any natural gifts, Merlin?

7
00:00:42,013 --> 00:00:43,467
当然不是
No.

8
00:00:43,467 --> 00:00:44,580
让我想想
Let me think...

9
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,910
也不是天生就这么粗鲁愚钝啦
I'm not naturally rude or insensitive.

10
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:51,390
不过是天生惹人怒罢了
Just naturally irritating.

11
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,810
也许它比你还恐惧
It's probably more scared of you than you are of it.

12
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,430
我们甩掉它了?       谁掉队了?
Have we lost it?        Who's missing?

13
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,512
贝蒂威尔骑士在哪?
Where's Sir Bedivere?

14

梅林传奇 第1季第13集</font>

18
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,760
你口中所描述的那生物的所有特征
The creature you describe has all the characteristics

19
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,490
都跟寻水兽相符     那不过是个传说
of the Questing Beast.        Surely that's a myth.

20
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,738
据史书记载
accroding to the old books of

21
00:02:39,738 --> 00:02:41,497
寻水兽的出现
the appearance of the Questing Beast

22
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,660
预示着一次剧变的到来
is supposed to foreshadow a time of great upheaval.

23
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,270
盖尤斯 那不过是老妇人的故事
Gaius, that's an old wives' tale.

24
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,860
管它是什么 现在大家被它搞得人心惶惶
Look, whatever it is, it is spreading panic.

25
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,170
人们害怕它会闯入这里
The people fear it will enter the city.

26
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,155
我们得了结它
Then we must kill it.

27
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:56,473
亚瑟 准备人马 我们破晓出发
Arthur, gather the guard together. We ride at dawn

28
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,570
求你了 陛下 别小看此兽 这是一个预兆
I beg you, Sire.do not dismiss this. The beast is an omen

29
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,211
我以前见过它
I have seen it come before,

30
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:11,984
就在您夫人艾葛兰死前那晚
the night your wife Ygraine passed away

31
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:14,280
告诉过你别再提那晚上的事了
I've told you not to speak of that night again.

32
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,979
我早就征服了古教
I have conquered the Old Religion.

33
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:19,619
它的警告对我不起作用
Its warnings mean nothing to me now.

34
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,215
等亚瑟灭掉那畜生
Arthur will destroy the beast

35
00:03:24,215 --> 00:03:26,651
我们就不必再受其折磨了
and we no longer suffer at its hand.

36
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,980
这次不是普通的怪兽 梅林
This is no ordinary beast, Merlin.

37
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,830
别担心      不 听我说 你不明白
Don't worry.        No, listen to me. You don't understand.

38
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,310
乌瑟不相信古教 但一切都是真的
Uther may not respect the Old Religion, but it is very real.

39
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,004
知彼知己
To face a beast such as this,

40
00:03:42,004 --> 00:03:44,034
方能百战不殆
you must understand where it came from.

41
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,690
你什么意思?      在古教的中心
What do you mean?        At the very heart of the Old Religion

42
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,250
蕴藏着生死魔法的本源
lies the magic of life and death itself.

43
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,310
寻水兽拥有那个力量
The Questing Beast carries that power.

44
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,230
咬上一口 你就没命了
One bite, you die.

45
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,170
无药可救
And there is no cure.

46
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,600
莫嘉娜! 莫嘉娜!
Morgana! Morgana!

47
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,770
醒醒!      不! 不!
Wake up!        No! No!

48
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:19,280
是我 是歌薇啊!醒醒 那不过是一场梦
It's me, it's Gwen! Stop it. It was just another dream.

49
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,770
太可怕了      没事了
It was terrifying.        It's all right.

50
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,570
你们已经见过敌人了
You've seen the foe we face.

51
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,010
那是一只可怕的怪兽
It's a creature of nightmare

52
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,040
但你们是王国里数一数二的骑士
But you are the best knights in the realm.

53
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,655
王国的子民受到伤害之前
We can and will kill it,

54
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:40,899
我们得干掉它
before it harms another citizen of our kingdom.

55
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,779
为对甘美洛的爱!
For the love of Camelot!

56
00:04:46,188 --> 00:04:48,420
为对甘美洛的爱!
For the love of Camelot!

57
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,040
亚瑟!
Arthur!

58
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,100
莫嘉娜 你来干什么?      你不能去
Morgana, what are you doing?        You cannot face it!

59
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,940
莫嘉娜 回去睡你的觉
Morgana, go back to bed.

60
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,522
没什么好怕的
There is nothing to be afraid of.

61
00:05:00,522 --> 00:05:03,190
求你了 亚瑟 我看到些可怕的东西
Please, Arthur. I have seen terrible things.

62
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,680
你不能去      她可能做噩梦了 殿下
You cannot go.        She's probably had a bad dream, Sire.

63
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,330
我让盖尤斯给她看看     不 我不能让你去!
I'll take her to see Gaius.        No, I will not let you go!

64
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,370
帮帮忙 梅林 把她拉进去      不!
Please, Merlin, get her inside.        No!

65
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:17,840
小姐 我会确保他的安全 我答应你      不!不!
I will make sure he is safe, my lady. I promise.        No! No!

66
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,350
跟着足迹走
Let's follow the trail.

67
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,450
跟紧点
Keep close.

68
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,660
是什么?
What is it?

69
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,910
喂
Hey!

70
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,950
(咒语)
Fleoge. Bregdan anwiele gefeluec!

71
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,300
它没咬中你 对吧?
It didn't bite you, did it?

72
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,180
亚瑟!
Arthur!

73
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,950
来人啊 救命啊!
Somebody help me!

74
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,080
发生什么事了?
What's happened?

75
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,710
他被咬了!      我试过救他
He's been bitten!         I tried to save him.

76
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,200
我们得禀告国王
We must tell the King.

77
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,578
你一定有办法的
There must be something you can do.

78
00:08:02,578 --> 00:08:05,320
我也希望有      我找找疗法
I wish there was.        I'll find a cure.

79
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,900
梅林!      相信我
Merlin!        Trust me.

80
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,420
你能听到我吗?殿下
Can you hear me, Sire?

81
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:12,860
这里
Here.

82
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,520
国外随时会到      他不能死
The King will be here any moment.        He can't die.

83
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,480
我的宿命是保护他
It is my destiny to protect him.

84
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,820
我们还没做过该做的事呢
We haven't done all the things we're meant to do!

85
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:26,230
这是所有人的哀痛      盖尤斯 他是我的朋友
That is the lament of all men.        Gaius, he's my friend.

86
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,490
那就拯救他
Then save him.

87
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,550
(咒语)
Gethlio!

88
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,880
(咒语)
Thurhaele!

89
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,300
也许咒语需要一点时间来发挥效用
Maybe the spells need time to take effect.

90
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,084
寻水兽的撕咬判定生死
The bite of the Questing Beast is a death sentence

91
00:08:52,084 --> 00:08:53,558
没有魔法能逆转
that no magic can overturn.

92
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,980
我的儿子在哪?亚瑟!
Where is my son? Arthur!

93
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,310
想办法啊 盖尤斯!
Do something, Gaius!

94
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,940
我正在努力 陛下
I am trying, Your Majesty.

95
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,040
盖尤斯会找到疗法 不会让他死去的
Gaius will find a cure. He will not let him die.

96
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,371
我会使劲浑身解数
I will do everything in my power.

97
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,840
我把他送回房间
I will bear him to his chamber.

98
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:28,880
我已经失去了亚瑟 我的使命已经失败了
I have failed Arthur,failed in my destiny.

99
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,570
如果真是这样的话 你不会来这里
And yet, you would not be here if that were true.

100
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,870
他被寻水兽咬到了
He was bitten by the Questing Beast.

101
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,480
他会死
He's going to die.

102
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,910
他还有呼吸吗?
Does he still breathe?

103
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,410
一息尚存      那么还有时间治愈他
Only just.         Then there is still time to heal him.

104
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:44,550
我试过了 但救不了他
I've tried, I cannot save him.

105
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:47,700
你不知道怎么救他
You do not know how to save him.

106
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,260
但你能告诉我 是吗?
But you can tell me how?

107
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,140
也许
Perhaps.

108
00:10:52,678 --> 00:10:54,460
可不是那么容易的
It will not be easy.

109
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,050
我愿意做任何事      任何事?
I will do anything.        Anything?

110
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,626
求你了 告诉我该怎么做吧!
Please. Just tell me what I have to do!

111
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:01,055
很好
Very well.

112
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:04,031
寻水兽是利用古教的魔力
The Questing Beast is a creature

113
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:07,093
召唤出来的神兽
conjured by the powers of the Old Religion.

114
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:11,480
你也要用同样的远古魔法来救他
You must use the same ancient magic to save him.

115
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,780
古教几百年前已经消亡
The Old Religion died out centuries ago.

116
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,210
古教就是土地本身的魔力
The Old Religion is the magic of the earth itself.

117
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:20,410
是将万物聚合在一起的原素
It is the essence which binds all things together.

118
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:24,050
会延续得比人类还长久
It will last long beyond the time of men.

119
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,100
这些和我救亚瑟有什么联系?
But how can that help me save Arthur?

120
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,040
你要找到仍然侍奉这种力量的人
You must find those who still serve it.

121
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,590
操控人们生死的人
Those who hold dominion over life and death.

122
00:11:34,091 --> 00:11:35,385
哪里?
Where?

123
00:11:35,385 --> 00:11:39,020
前往人们称为祈愿岛的地方
Go to the place that men call the Isle of the Blessed,

124
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:43,080
远古力量在那里仍然存在
where the power of the ancients can still be felt.

125
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,830
你在那里能找到拯救亚瑟的办法
There you will discover Arthur's salvation.

126
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,620
谢谢
Thank you.

127
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,860
谢谢      梅林
Thank you.        And Merlin

128
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:59,860
小潘达贡必须活着 不管要付出多大的代价
the young Pendragon must live, no matter what the cost.

129
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,710
梅林 你回来了
Merlin, you're back.

130
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:08,513
我需要你的帮助
I need your help.

131
00:12:08,513 --> 00:12:11,591
我们得把这个带给亚瑟 让他去得安详点
We must get this to Arthur to ease his passing.

132
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,190
不 我们要救他      我们已经试过了
No. We have to save him.        We've already tried.

133
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,070
那神兽出自古教
The Beast comes from the Old Religion

134
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,458
解法也应当出自那里
the cure must come from there as well.

135
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,422
通晓这些的人为数不多了
There are few left with such an art.

136
00:12:20,422 --> 00:12:22,386
你说过古教依然存在
You said yourself that the Old Religion still alive,and...

137
00:12:22,386 --> 00:12:24,590
在白山附近有个岛...       不!
There is an island beyond the white mountains...         No!

138
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:29,460
祈愿岛 你知道?
The Isle of the Blessed - you know it?

139
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:34,242
据说那里是古教的中心
It was said to be the centre of the Old Religion,

140
00:12:34,242 --> 00:12:35,917
凝聚了所有的力量
the focus of its power.

141
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,510
你为什么不告诉我?
Why did you keep this from me?

142
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,511
因为太危险了 梅林
Because it was too dangerous, Merlin.

143
00:12:39,511 --> 00:12:41,350
这是我们唯一的机会!
It's our only chance!

144
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,940
我一定要找到它!
I have to find it.

145
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,905
一旦你到达那里 你要祈求什么?
And once you are there, what will you ask?

146
00:12:45,905 --> 00:12:47,120
祈求亚瑟得救
For Arthur to be saved.

147
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,955
寻水兽选中了亚瑟
The Questing Beast chose Arthur.

148
00:12:49,955 --> 00:12:52,567
意味着古教决定了他的命运
That means the Old Religion has decided his fate.

149
00:12:52,567 --> 00:12:54,267
那我就劝服他们改变主意
Then I will convince them to change their minds.

150
00:12:54,267 --> 00:12:56,364
没那么容易!
It is not that simple!

151
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:04,150
大祭司拥有镜像生命和死亡的能力
The high priests have the power to mirror life and death.

152
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,617
但要付出代价
But there will be a price to pay.

153
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,554
要一命换一命
They will demand a life in return.

154
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:18,300
梅林 别那样 我恳求你...
Merlin, please, I beg of you...

155
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,680
我很抱歉 盖尤斯
I'm sorry, Gaius.

156
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:25,084
但无论代价是什么 我都愿意承受
But whatever the price is, I will pay it gladly.

157
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,860
给你 你需要地图
Here. You'll need a map.

158
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,200
还有这个 给你
And I'm going to give you this.

159
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,440
我母亲给我的
My mother gave it to me.

160
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,730
是兔子腿
It's a rabbit's foot.

161
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,589
保佑你平安?
To keep you safe?

162
00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:06,261
据说能保护人类免受邪灵的袭击
It was said to protect you from evil spirits.

163
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,430
是废物啦 我不信这些迷信的东西
It's rubbish. I don't believe the superstition.

164
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,770
我不知道我为什么要给你
I don't know why I gave it to you. No.

165
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,010
我想要
I want it.

166
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:16,680
谢谢
Thank you.

167
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,480
在我回来之前 你要让亚瑟好好活着
You've got to keep Arthur alive until I get back.

168
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,410
睡吧 亚瑟
Sleep, Arthur.

169
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,865
你要前往
You must travel to the place

170
00:15:16,865 --> 00:15:19,709
人们称为祈愿岛的地方
that men call the Isle of the Blessed,

171
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,496
在白山后面
'beyond the white mountains,

172
00:15:22,496 --> 00:15:25,108
穿过王落谷
through the Valley of the Fallen Kings.

173
00:15:30,049 --> 00:15:32,842
在梅里铎之海的北边
'To the north of the Great Seas of Meredor,

174
00:15:32,842 --> 00:15:35,431
会找到一个湖
you will find a lake.'

175
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,330
盖尤斯
Gaius.

176
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,730
你该休息一下
You should get some rest.

177
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,330
他需要有人照看
He must not be left alone.

178
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:53,650
我会照顾他
I will nurse him.

179
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:21,270
你不可以死 亚瑟 我在跟你说话呢
You're not going to die, Arthur. I'm telling you.

180
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:26,160
因为我知道有一天 你会成为国王
Because I know that one day, you will be King,

181
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29,870
远胜于你父亲的伟大君主
a greater king than your father could ever be.

182
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,901
那是我活下去的动力
It's what keeps me going.

183
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:42,510
你要活着 成为我期望看到的人 亚瑟
You are going to live to be the man I've seen inside you, Arthur

184
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:47,210
让我看到卡美洛变得平等公正
I can see a Camelot that is fair and just.

185
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,565
让我看到人们爱戴
I can see a king that the people will love

186
00:16:49,565 --> 00:16:52,851
自豪地奉为君主的人
and be proud to call their sovereign.

187
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,740
为了对卡美洛的爱...
For the love of Camelot...

188
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,860
你必须活下去
you have to live.

189
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,550
我能给你拿点什么吗?陛下
Is there anything I can get Your Majesty?

190
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,240
人们开始告别
The people have begun to say goodbye.

191
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:37,670
他还没死 陛下      但他不会复原了
He is not yet gone, Sire.        But he will not recover.

192
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,110
除非有奇迹发生
Not without a miracle.

193
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,980
我不相信奇迹
I don't believe in miracles.

194
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,890
(咒语)
Astyre!

195
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,829
有人吗?
Hello?

196
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,650
你好 梅林
Hello, Merlin.

197
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,620
是你?
You?

198
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,360
你知道我是谁?      妮摩薇
Do you know who I am?        Nimueh.

199
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,900
你不会是神龙说的那人
You can't be who the Dragon meant.

200
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,390
为什么这么说?
And why is that?

201
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,182
你想杀我
You tried to kill me.

202
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:44,493
那是在我意识到你有多重要之前
Before I understood your importance.

203
00:19:44,493 --> 00:19:44,619
而亚瑟...
And Arthur...

204
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:48,110
亚瑟命不该绝于我手中
Arthur was never destined to die at my hand.

205
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,970
而现在 看来我成了他的救星
And now, it seems I will be his salvation.

206
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,620
那你知道我为何而来?
So you know what I've come to ask?

207
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,165
是的       你愿意这么做吗?
Yes.        Will you do it?

208
00:19:57,165 --> 00:19:58,058
我没有强大到
I do not have the power

209
00:19:58,058 --> 00:20:00,510
能复制生命而什么都不索取
to mirror life itself and yet give nothing in return.

210
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,812
我知道会有代价的
I know a price will be asked.

211
00:20:01,812 --> 00:20:03,434
要拯救一条生命 必然要有人送命
To save a life, there must be a death.

212
00:20:03,434 --> 00:20:05,870
世界的平衡必须被复原
The balance of the world must be restored.

213
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,300
我愿意用自己一命来换亚瑟的
I willingly give my life for Arthur's.

214
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,400
真勇敢啊 梅林
How brave you are, Merlin.

215
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,157
如果能这么简单的话
If only it were that simple.

216
00:20:16,771 --> 00:20:17,981
你什么意思?
What do you mean?

217
00:20:17,981 --> 00:20:20,840
一旦进入交易 那就必须完成
Once you enter into this bargain, it cannot be undone.

218
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,830
无论做什么 我都愿意
Whatever I have to do, I will do.

219
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,610
他的命抵我的百倍
His life is worth a hundred of mine.

220
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,930
生命之杯
The Cup of Life,

221
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,642
由千百年来的强大法术庇佑
blessed by centuries of powerful sorcery

222
00:20:31,642 --> 00:20:34,604
它承载着生命的秘密
so that it contains the very secret of life itself.

223
00:20:34,604 --> 00:20:40,110
如果亚瑟能喝到杯中之水... 那他便能活过来
If Arthur drinks water from the cup...he will live.

224
00:20:52,444 --> 00:20:54,220
(咒语)
Tidrenas!

225
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,590
交易已经达成
The bargain is struck.

226
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,340
我希望它会令你满意
I hope it pleases you.

227
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,590
梅林      我们要把这个给亚瑟
Merlin!         We need to give this to Arthur.

228
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:55,790
这是什么     水 取自生命之杯
What is it?        Water, drawn from the Cup of Life.

229
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:59,450
如果亚瑟喝了这个他就会复活 快点
If Arthur drinks from it, he will recover. Please hurry!

230
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,650
你还在等什么
What are you waiting for?

231
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:10,250
你用什么偿还他的生命
What price did you pay to redeem his life?

232
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,510
你用谁的命做交易
Whose life did you bargain?

233
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:14,170
我们没时间了      梅林
We don't have time.         Merlin!

234
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:17,970
别担心 盖尤斯 一切都会好的
Don't worry, Gaius, everything's going to be all right.

235
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:32,690
你在做什么 御医? 你给他的是什么
What are you doing, physician? What are you giving him?

236
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,640
这是 呃...
It's, er...

237
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:42,820
是药剂 由半边莲制成
It's a tincture, made from the lobelia plant.

238
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,940
一个治疗毒物咬伤的古老方剂
An ancient remedy for poisonous bites.

239
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,120
能治愈?
A cure?

240
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,230
但愿吧
We hope.

241
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,660
你真的觉得这会有效?
Do you really think it will have some effect?

242
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,780
这是我们仅有的办法了 殿下
It's our last resort, Sire.

243
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,571
也许您该让他休息一下
Perhaps you should allow him to rest.

244
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:11,053
我不会离开他的
I will not leave him.

245
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,630
拜托 梅林 你一定要小心
Please, Merlin, you must beware.

246
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,610
一切刚刚开始
This is only the beginning.

247
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,514
亚瑟!
Arthur!

248
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,560
王子活过来了
The Prince lives.

249
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,990
我以为失去你了
I thought we'd lost you.

250
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,760
别担心 父王 我不会死的
Don't worry, Father, I'm not going to die.

251
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,420
我想一定有人在关照我 让我远离死亡
I think there's someone watching over me,keeping me from her.

252
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:57,980
也许你是对的
Maybe you're right.

253
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,760
在你漫长的王者之路上
On your long journey to become King,

254
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,750
需要一个守护天使
you'll need a guardian angel.

255
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,090
我要去皇宫昭告他们的王子复活了
I shall inform the court that their Prince lives.

256
00:25:16,604 --> 00:25:18,350
我就知道
I knew it.

257
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,550
我说过你会没事的
I said you'd be all right.

258
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,480
我记得你和我说过话
I can remember you talking to me.

259
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,410
你记得?      你抚摸着我的额头
You can?         You stroked my forehead.

260
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,070
我在测你的体温      永不要失去信心
I was tending to your fever.       Never lost faith.

261
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:38,450
我只是说说      再告诉我一次你说话
I was just talking.         Tell me again what you said.

262
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:40,130
我不记得了
I don't remember.

263
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:41,660
你当然记得
Yes, you do.

264
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:43,990
不 我忘了       来嘛
No, I don't.         Come on.

265
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:48,410
关于什么我内心是怎样的男人
Something about the man I am inside.

266
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,090
不 我从未说过这些        歌妮薇
No, I never said that.        Guinevere!

267
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:57,350
我得去洗这些了 殿下
I have to get these washed, Sire.

268
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,410
盖尤斯
Gaius!

269
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:23,841
我还活着 是怎么回事? 发生了什么?
I'm alive! What is it? What's happened?

270
00:27:23,841 --> 00:27:25,086
梅林 呆在那
Merlin, stay there.

271
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,950
怎么回事
What's wrong?

272
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,470
不 别过来
No, don't.

273
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,390
妈妈?
Mother?

274
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,850
梅林
Merlin...

275
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,140
她怎么了?      她病得很严重
What's happened to her?         She's gravely ill.

276
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,963
做些什么!      如果我能的话...
Do something!        If I could...

277
00:27:42,963 --> 00:27:44,392
拜托了 盖尤斯
Please, Gaius.

278
00:27:44,392 --> 00:27:46,490
梅林 这不是一般的疾病
Merlin, this is no ordinary illness.

279
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,155
这不该发生的!
This cannot happen!

280
00:27:50,699 --> 00:27:52,555
你去祈愿岛见的谁?
Who did you meet at the Isle of the Blessed?

281
00:27:52,555 --> 00:27:53,722
妮摩薇
Nimueh.

282
00:27:53,722 --> 00:27:55,990
妮摩薇?!       就是她
Nimueh?!         It was as you said.

283
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,053
她要回报
She demanded a price.

284
00:27:57,053 --> 00:27:59,115
我用自己的生命做交易 而不是我母亲的
But I bargained my life, not my mother's!

285
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:03,390
梅林 我希望能做些什么
Merlin, I wish there was something I could do.

286
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:09,780
我会让你好起来的 我会的
I will make you better. I will.

287
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,380
你知道这会发生的
You knew this would happen!

288
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:20,960
你让我用自己母亲的性命换亚瑟的
You had me trade my mother's life for Arthur's!

289
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,120
你说过会做任何事
You said you would do anything.

290
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:25,040
你知道我妈妈会死吗?
Did you know my mother would die?

291
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,657
我知道这条性命的分量非比寻常
I knew the price would be a heavy one.

292
00:28:27,657 --> 00:28:28,681
但你还是要我去了
But you sent me anyway.

293
00:28:28,681 --> 00:28:30,870
我们需要亚瑟活着
We need Arthur to live.

294
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,400
我不是你们中的一员!
I'm not one of you!

295
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,180
我们都是古教的产物
We are both creatures of the Old Religion.

296
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,570
这是你的力量之源
It is the source of your power.

297
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:38,860
这是什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

298
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:42,147
你的宿命便是保护年轻的潘达贡
Your destiny is to protect the young Pendragon

299
00:28:42,147 --> 00:28:43,718
直到他加上皇冕
until he claims his crown.

300
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:48,120
而当他封王 魔法便会重回大地
And when he does, magic can be returned to the realm.

301
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:52,380
只有那样我才会重获自由
Only then will I be free.

302
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,790
这就是你所关心全部?
So that's all you cared about?

303
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,570
我以为你是我的朋友
I thought you were my friend.

304
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:03,560
我不只是你的朋友 梅林
I am more than that, Merlin.

305
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,850
我是你的亲人
I am your kin.

306
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:08,920
不 我唯一的亲人就是我妈妈
No, the only family I have is my mother,

307
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,804
而你还让我害死了她
and you had me murder her.

308
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,290
她的性命不是白白丢掉的
Her life has not been taken in vain.

309
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:17,360
我们一起会共创伟业 你和我
We will achieve great things together, you and I.

310
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,639
你永远不会被释放
You will never be release.

311
00:29:20,363 --> 00:29:25,040
因为你的所作所为 我保证不会让你重见光明
For what you've done, I'll make sure you never see the light.

312
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,660
梅林
Merlin!

313
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:45,480
你... 不会再见到我了
You...won't see me...again.

314
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,220
她在哪?
Where is she?

315
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,850
她还在睡
She's sleeping.

316
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:27,400
我一定要救她      你没办法
I have to save her.         You cannot.

317
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:30,284
如果世界需要一条生命来平衡
If the balance of the world needs a life,

318
00:30:30,284 --> 00:30:32,178
那就让歌妮薇把我的取走
then Nimueh must take mine.

319
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:34,990
不 梅林
No, Merlin.

320
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,240
是的 我要回到岛上
Yes. I will return to the island.

321
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,446
你还年轻 你的天赋 你的宿命
You are young. Your gifts, your destiny,

322
00:30:41,446 --> 00:30:43,525
比自我牺牲珍贵得多
are far too precious to sacrifice.

323
00:30:43,525 --> 00:30:46,370
我的宿命? 这是我母亲
My destiny? This is my mother.

324
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,700
如果不能救她那我的法力一无是处
My powers mean nothing if I cannot save her.

325
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,100
你教会了我许多
You have taught me so much.

326
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:05,420
你教会我认识自我 教会我法术的用途
You taught me who I am, taught me the purpose for my skills,

327
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:10,750
教会我魔法只能用在该用的地方
taught me that magic should only be used for great deeds.

328
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:15,852
最重要的是 你一直教导我...
But most of all, you have always taught me...

329
00:31:17,397 --> 00:31:19,148
要做正确的事情
to do what is right.

330
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,240
梅林...
Merlin...

331
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,260
我要去向亚瑟告别
I need to say goodbye to Arthur.

332
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:52,230
啊 梅林      你怎么样?
Ah, Merlin.        How are you?

333
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,940
很好
Good.

334
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,740
我为你高兴
I'm pleased.

335
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,850
是啊
Yes.

336
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:01,420
多亏了盖尤斯
I owe it all to Gaius.

337
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,200
我有事要跟你说
I need to talk to you.

338
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,960
你还是不理解 是吧?
You still haven't got it yet, have you?

339
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,600
我想谈的时候才能谈
I decide when we need to talk.

340
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,260
今天不行
Not today.

341
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:19,130
有时候我都怀疑你知不知道我是谁
I sometimes wonder if you know who I am.

342
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,470
哦 我知道你是谁
Oh, I know who you are.

343
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,629
很好
Good.

344
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,882
你是个混蛋
You're a prat.

345
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:28,060
皇家混蛋
And a royal one.

346
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,279
你怎样也改不了吗 梅林?
Are you ever going to change, Merlin?

347
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,036
不会 会让你厌倦的
No. You'd get bored.

348
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,841
请你保证如果再找仆人的话
Promise me this, if you get another servant,

349
00:32:40,841 --> 00:32:42,171
不要找那种只会拍马屁的
don't get a bootlicker.

350
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:45,880
如果你这是想请辞...      不
If this is you trying to leave your job...          No.

351
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:50,740
我很乐意做你的仆人 直到我生命终结的那一天
I'm happy to be your servant, till the day I die.

352
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,190
有时候我觉得我挺了解你的 梅林
Sometimes I think I know you, Merlin.

353
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:05,180
而也有些时候...      我了解你
Other times...        Well, I know you.

354
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:08,420
你是个伟大的勇士
And you're a great warrior.

355
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:12,320
将来有一天你会成为伟大的国王
One day you will be a great king.

356
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,760
承蒙夸奖
That's very kind of you.

357
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,244
但你在学着作战的同时也必须要学会听进忠言
But you must learn to listen as well as you fight.

358
00:33:18,161 --> 00:33:19,595
还有其它指教吗?
Any other pointers?

359
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,120
没有了
No.

360
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,320
就这些
That's it.

361
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,840
只是...
Just...

362
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:32,140
别做一个混蛋
don't be a prat.

363
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,670
盖尤斯去拿一些补给品了
Gaius had to go and get some supplies.

364
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:53,974
他让我看着她 等你回来
He asked me to keep an eye on her until you got back.

365
00:33:53,974 --> 00:33:55,636
谢谢你
Thank you.

366
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:05,130
我很难过      不 她会好起来的
I'm sorry.       No, she'll get better.

367
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,310
我尽量让她感到舒适一些
I've tried to make her feel comfortable.

368
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:13,160
你有着一颗善良的心 歌薇
You've such a good heart, Gwen.

369
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:15,050
永远不要丢弃
Don't ever lose that.

370
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,680
我会让你好起来的 我保证
I'm gonna make you well again. I promise.

371
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,700
你会看到的
You'll see.

372
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:40,760
你真是个好孩子
You're such a good son.

373
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,210
但我不想让你为我担心
But I don't want you to worry about me.

374
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,780
我知道神灵会眷顾我
I know that the Gods will look after me

375
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:56,030
有一天 我们会再见面的
and that one day, I will see you again.

376
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,670
我会想你的
I will miss you.

377
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:05,410
我也会想你的
I'll miss you, too.

378
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,840
盖尤斯
Gaius?

379
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:49,720
亲爱的梅林
'Dear Merlin,

380
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:52,940
我的生命已经快要走到尽头
'my life is already near to its end.

381
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:58,590
我一生的大部分时间里 都过得毫无意义
'There has, for the most part, been very little purpose to it.

382
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,090
没有太多值得被怀念
'Very little that will be remembered.

383
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:09,110
相比之下 梅林 你注定拥有伟大的一生
'In contrast, Merlin, your life is destined for greatness.

384
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:14,180
遵循我教过你的原则
'Live by the tenets I have taught you,

385
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,479
我相信假以时日
'and I believe you will, in time,

386
00:36:16,479 --> 00:36:20,414
你一定会成为最伟大的魔法师
become the greatest warlock ever.

387
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:23,870
认识你是我最大的荣幸
'To have known you has been my greatest pleasure,

388
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:29,000
为你牺牲对我来说是种荣耀
'and to sacrifice myself for you is but an honour.

389
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:36,200
你永远都是我的孩子
'You are, and will always be, the son I never had.'

390
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,830
不要!
No!

391
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:13,660
我从来没想过我们会再次在此会面
I never thought I'd see you here again.

392
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,610
夫人
My Lady.

393
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,498
你很久没有这么叫我了
It is a long time since you called me that.

394
00:37:19,498 --> 00:37:21,423
我是来请求你的帮助的
I've come to ask for your help.

395
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:24,020
就像你上次为乌瑟做的一样吗
As you once did before, for Uther.

396
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,480
你并不喜欢那个结果
You did not like the outcome.

397
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,720
我给你一个为他妻子之死赎罪的机会
I offer a chance for you to atone for the death of his wife.

398
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,940
我救过她儿子的性命
I have saved the life of her son.

399
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,280
你还想要怎样?
What more do you ask for?

400
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,410
这一次 我们做个公平的交易
That this time, you take a just price.

401
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,730
梅林想用他的生命换取他母亲的
Merlin intends to offer his life for his mother's.

402
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,140
我要你让我顶替他的位置
I want you to take mine in his place.

403
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:46,564
尽我所有预言的能力
With all my powers of prediction,

404
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:49,022
我也无法预知到这些
I could never have foretold this.

405
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:52,320
英雄盖尤斯
Gaius the hero!

406
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,410
我为何要答应你的请求?
Why should I grant your wish?

407
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:03,644
你眼睁睁地看着我们的朋友们
You stood and watched as our friends

408
00:38:03,644 --> 00:38:05,235
在大肃清行动中被活活烧死
burned in the Great Purge.

409
00:38:05,402 --> 00:38:07,320
你就是一个叛徒
You are nothing but a traitor.

410
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:11,360
梅林是可以把魔法带回这片土地的人
Merlin is the one man who can bring magic back to this land.

411
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:15,150
在亚瑟身边 他可以协助建立一个新的王国
At Arthur's side, he can help forge a new kingdom.

412
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:19,160
一个我们梦寐以求的美丽安宁的世界
A world of peace and beauty that we can only dream of.

413
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:22,140
而你原意宁愿付出你的生命 盖尤斯
And you're willing to give your life, Gaius,

414
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,160
只为了他们所能造就的将来?
for the future they will bring?

415
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,310
我在等你的答案
I'm waiting.

416
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,110
你准备受死了吗 盖尤斯?
Are you ready to die, Gaius?

417
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,580
盖尤斯?
Gaius?

418
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:44,650
为了梅林 我原意献出我的生命
For Merlin, I will give my life.

419
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:57,490
(咒语)
Ic, seo heahsacerd, the acwelle strengthe ealdan aewfaestnesse!

420
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:58,780
住手!
Stop!

421
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,890
这么快就回来啦 魔法师?
Back again so soon, warlock?

422
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:05,370
你做了什么?
What have you done?

423
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:07,390
你母亲不会有事了
Your mother is safe.

424
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,250
这不是你想要的吗?
Isn't that what you wanted?

425
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,730
你杀了他吗?
Have you killed him?

426
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,690
这是他的愿望
It was his wish.

427
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:18,690
我用我的生命去换取亚瑟的生命 不是用我母亲或盖尤斯的
I bid my life for Arthur's, not my mother's, not Gaius'!

428
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:21,500
古教是不会在乎谁死谁活
The Old Religion does not care who lives or dies.

429
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,020
它只在乎世界的平衡得到维持
Only that the balance of the world is restored.

430
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:28,600
一命换一命 盖尤斯知道这个
To save a life, a life must be taken. Gaius knew this.

431
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,130
这不是古教的所为 而是你
It is not the Old Religion that has done this. It is you.

432
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,760
来吧
Come, now.

433
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,370
我们对彼此都有利用价值 做敌人太可惜
We are too valuable to each other to be enemies.

434
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:38,110
不 我跟你没有任何共同之处
No! I share nothing with you.

435
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:40,390
有了我的帮助 亚瑟会成为国王的
With my help, Arthur will become King.

436
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:43,760
我会让亚瑟成为国王的 但你永远也看不到
I will make Arthur King. But you will never see that day.

437
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:45,350
(咒语)
Astrice!

438
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:50,440
你这些小把戏对我没用 梅林
Your childish tricks are useless against me, Merlin.

439
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:53,340
我可是古教的女祭司
I am a priestess of the Old Religion.

440
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,220
(咒语)
Forbearne!

441
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,040
你也是古教的一个人材
You too are a creature of the Old Religion.

442
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,400
你我应该联手的
You should join me.

443
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,270
你以为我会跟自私
You think I would join forces with

444
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:12,964
而又残忍的魔法师联手吗?
such a selfish and cruel magic?

445
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,570
休想
Never.

446
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:17,670
那好吧
So be it. Akwele!

447
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,470
真可惜
Pity.

448
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:36,040
你我联手本可统治世界的
Together, we could have ruled the world.

449
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:52,630
你不该杀害我朋友的
You should not have killed my friend.

450
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:25,960
盖尤斯!
Gaius!

451
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:28,950
盖尤斯!
Gaius!

452
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:39,040
不! 不!
No-o-o! No-o-o!

453
00:41:46,729 --> 00:41:50,630
梅林 梅林
Merlin... Merlin...

454
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,817
盖尤斯!
Gaius!

455
00:41:55,577 --> 00:41:57,292
盖尤斯 你还活着
Gaius, you're alive!

456
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:01,570
你做了什么?
What did you do?

457
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:08,670
妮摩薇已经死了 世界的平衡已经得到恢复
Nimueh's dead. The balance of the world has been restored.

458
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:10,650
你真让我惊喜
You amaze me.

459
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:15,570
你已经掌握了生与死的力量
You've mastered the power of life and death itself.

460
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,190
我们将让你成为一名伟大的魔法师
We'll make a great warlock of you yet!

461
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:23,850
那你现在相信我了?
So you believe in me now?

462
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:30,590
我相信你... 只要...
Well, I would do...if...

463
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,170
只要你能...
if you could...

464
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:36,890
阻止这场讨厌的雨
stop this blasted rain!

465
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,340
梅林!
Merlin!

466
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:00,720
不!
No! Aaagh!
