1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
Camera? Yes, I'll be the camera today.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,280
Ah, Fantia! Fantia's article!

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,580
Ah, it's public!

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,780
Ah, well...

5
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,180
I'll do Fantia first.

6
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,680
Wait a minute, I'll tweet it too.

7
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,240
Fantia...

8
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,680
Ah, is it another computer?

9
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,880
I'm uploading Fantia.

10
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,020
Um...

11
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,720
Is this still unreleased?

12
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,360
Hm? I'm uploading it.

13
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,120
Eh? It's not being released?

14
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,500
Ah, it's not being released.

15
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,300
Wait a minute.

16
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,340
I'll do this...

17
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,140
There we go.

18
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,340
I think the data is probably already being released.

19
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,140
The data.

20
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,340
The article isn't being released, but the product is already out.

21
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,140
Look at the article, it's already been released.

22
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:45,920
There we go.

23
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,580
I'll do the X too.

24
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:49,320
X.

25
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,960
I'm not doing the free part today.

26
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,620
Well, the free part...

27
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,960
I'm not doing it, so...

28
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,960
Well...

29
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,760
I'll talk a little bit about it live first, and then...

30
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,360
Um...

31
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,860
I'll do a lot of things.

32
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,660
That's what I'm thinking.

33
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:08,900
First...

34
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,260
I'll do a tweet...

35
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,800
X? Post?

36
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:13,600
There we go.

37
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,340
It's starting.

38
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,540
There we go.

39
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,140
Sakura.

40
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:20,780
Um...

41
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,720
First, live...

42
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,520
Live...

43
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,980
Live chat?

44
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:31,620
There we go.

45
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,620
There we go.

46
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,460
I tweeted.

47
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,200
I'm feeling good.

48
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,240
Speaking of feeling good, today...

49
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,180
Um...

50
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:50,680
What was it?

51
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,080
Ah, but I'll talk about it during the pillow talk.

52
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,080
What should I do?

53
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,540
What happened today...

54
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,400
I'll start the video in about 15 minutes.

55
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,800
At first, 10 minutes...

56
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,200
About 10 minutes.

57
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,940
I'll talk for about 10 minutes from now on.

58
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,900
My voice is hoarse.

59
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,780
I've been sleeping all this time because I'm not feeling well.

60
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,880
Um...

61
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,180
Well...

62
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,080
X...

63
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,280
I wrote something for X.

64
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,420
The video I made today...

65
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,320
I was planning to do it on the 24th.

66
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:32,040
But on the 24th, there was a huge wave of people getting sick.

67
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,320
And then, I realized that live streaming was a bit difficult.

68
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:42,360
So I recorded the rest of the fan club and Nico Nico.

69
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,120
I recorded it.

70
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,700
Yeah.

71
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,920
So I went to the hospital.

72
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,920
I went to a different hospital.

73
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,560
I consulted with the doctor and changed my medicine.

74
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,560
And that medicine was a bit...

75
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,660
I still had one day left today, so it's a bit...

76
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,000
I tried it, but I was really sleepy.

77
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,340
I was sleeping all the time.

78
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,040
I...

79
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,940
In my dream, I ate chicken nuggets.

80
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,700
When I woke up, my mouth was like,

81
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,380
I was munching on my food.

82
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:29,180
I couldn't tell the dream from the reality.

83
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,520
I was dreaming of chicken nuggets.

84
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,920
Yeah, chicken nuggets.

85
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,760
I was dreaming of eating chicken nuggets.

86
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,360
I was munching on my food while I was awake.

87
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,760
And that's it.

88
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,660
And today's video...

89
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,900
I got a video from a video editor.

90
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,660
And I just wanted to make sure.

91
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,660
I really...

92
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,660
I was wondering if the video editor was okay.

93
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,740
I always thank the video editor, but I think it's because of the coronavirus.

94
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,080
I don't know if it's because of the coronavirus.

95
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,680
I don't know if I'm making a mistake at work.

96
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,720
I don't know if I should put it on the video.

97
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,180
Yeah, there's something like that.

98
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,820
So I'm going to watch it all again.

99
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,120
I'm going to watch the full video.

100
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,520
I'm going to cut this part for a few minutes.

101
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,560
I can see my chin here.

102
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,300
I'm going to do that.

103
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,860
Yeah, I'm going to do that.

104
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,160
I'll do it around the evening.

105
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,300
And I just got a video from the video editor.

106
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,980
I'm going to do that.

107
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,680
I've already cut it in advance.

108
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,040
I've already cut the angle change.

109
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,380
I think it's a little short.

110
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:49,320
I usually do it for about two hours.

111
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,180
And the rental plan is 1 hour and 30 minutes.

112
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:57,020
It's long, so it's about 1 hour and 50 minutes.

113
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:02,400
This video is about an hour and a half.

114
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,500
It's about an hour and 20 minutes.

115
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,400
It's about that long.

116
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,000
But the content is...

117
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,700
I'm really cutting all the angles.

118
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:20,340
I think the tempo is good.

119
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,780
I think the tempo is getting better.

120
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:28,280
I've been recording for about three hours.

121
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,120
I've been recording for about three hours.

122
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,020
I think I can do it.

123
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,380
I did it.

124
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,020
I did it.

125
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,320
I did it.

126
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,620
I did it.

127
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,820
I think everyone's break is over.

128
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,460
Everyone's break is over.

129
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:55,240
I think I can do it because it's a video.

130
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,860
I think I can do it because it's a video.

131
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,600
Shoulder angle.

132
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,500
I think I can see my neck a little.

133
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,100
I think I can do it because it's a video.

134
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:10,700
I'll try to look at it from below.

135
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,080
I'll try to look at it from below.

136
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,080
I hope you'll take a look.

137
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,080
I'm looking forward to it.

138
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,080
I'll take a break.

139
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,080
I dropped my earring.

140
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,100
I'm worried.

141
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,100
I'm worried if I'll fall asleep.

142
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:49,100
The medicine I got from the hospital is different from the usual medicine.

143
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,100
I got a new medicine.

144
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:56,100
I'm really sleepy.

145
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:02,100
If I have a job at night,

146
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,100
I drink it three hours before.

147
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:12,100
Or after the broadcast, I eat yogurt or rice balls.

148
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,100
I can't drink it without eating.

149
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,100
If you drink it without eating, it will have twice the effect.

150
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:24,100
I'm afraid of side effects, so I have half of it.

151
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:30,100
I had a half of a cup of it.

152
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:36,100
If the broadcast starts at 23 o'clock, I'll check the video in the evening.

153
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,100
I checked the video and finished it.

154
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,100
What time is it?

155
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,100
18 o'clock?

156
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:48,100
I ate a little and drank it at 18 o'clock.

157
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,100
It was really bad.

158
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,100
It's really bad.

159
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:58,100
It's a big deal.

160
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,100
So...

161
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:05,100
I'm still sleepy.

162
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:16,100
I'll put the details in the summary section.

163
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,100
Miko-san.

164
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,100
I want to talk about pillow talk.

165
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:32,100
I want to talk about the impression of the past.

166
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:37,100
And what it will be like in the future.

167
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:43,100
I want to talk about my current situation.

168
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:51,100
I want to talk about how I can continue for a long time.

169
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,100
I don't talk about negative things.

170
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,100
I don't talk about negative things.

171
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,100
You don't understand.

172
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:06,100
If you hear my voice, you'll be in the way of the management comments.

173
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:11,100
I talked about it when I was smiling.

174
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:19,100
I hope you'll be immersed in this video.

175
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,100
I'm going to be immersed in this video.

176
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,100
That's right.

177
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,100
Good, good.

178
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,100
What will happen next?

179
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,100
I'll be back on the show.

180
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,100
I'm not going to be on the show.

181
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,100
I'll be back on the show in a few days.

182
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,100
It's embarrassing.

183
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,100
This is the third time.

184
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,100
The fourth time.

185
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,100
I checked the data and the face.

186
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,100
I gave it to the video editor.

187
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:09,100
I checked the data from the video editor.

188
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:14,100
The video editor came to me three times.

189
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:20,100
I did an audio documentary.

190
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,100
This is the fourth time.

191
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,100
I don't want to talk about my own situation.

192
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,100
I'm full.

193
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,100
I know this is coming.

194
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,100
I'll say this line after this.

195
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,100
I'll tell you a story.

196
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,100
I'll tell you a story.

197
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,100
I'll start.

198
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,100
I'll change the page.

199
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,100
Wait a minute.

200
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,100
I'll start.

201
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,100
The site URL is...

202
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:04,100
I'll show you the URL on the bottom right.

203
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,100
There's a hip angle.

204
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,100
There's a hip angle.

205
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,100
Yes.

206
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,100
Yes.

207
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,100
I'm nervous.

208
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,100
I took a break.

209
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:29,100
I edited the video.

210
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,100
But I had a lot of fun.

211
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,100
I had a lot of fun.

212
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,100
I'm about to...

213
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,100
I'm about to...

214
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:51,100
I'm about to end the broadcast.

215
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,100
It's been an hour.

216
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:59,100
It's been an hour and 20 minutes.

217
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,100
It's been an hour and 20 minutes.

218
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:05,100
It's hard to be in the archive.

219
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,100
I can't see the archive.

220
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:13,100
It's about an hour and a half in real time.

221
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,100
It's about an hour and a half in real time.

222
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:20,100
I'll see you again in an hour and a half.

223
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:27,100
I'll see you again in an hour and a half.

224
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:33,100
I'm going to say, please go.

225
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:38,100
I'm going to say, please go.

226
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,100
Wait a minute.

227
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,100
It's the worst.

228
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,100
Please go.

229
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,100
I'm Kanan.

230
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,100
I'm Miko today.

231
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,100
I'm a little nervous.

232
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,100
I'm a little out of it.

233
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,100
I'm a little out of it.

234
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,100
I'm Miko today.

235
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:20,100
Last year, there were some bad things.

236
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,100
I'll set it up.

237
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,100
Last year, I was unlucky.

238
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,100
I was a little out of it.

239
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,100
I was a little out of it.

240
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,100
I'll set you up like a drug lord.

241
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:43,100
I hope everything goes well this year.

242
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:56,100
I'm going to do a lot of bad things.

243
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,100
I'm nervous.

244
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,100
I'm not used to it.

245
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,100
I'm not used to this feeling.

246
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,100
I'm nervous.

247
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:18,100
I hope you feel good.

248
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:30,100
I'll do my best to get rid of the drugs.

249
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:40,100
I'm going to do a lot of bad things.

250
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:44,100
First of all, I'll say hello.

251
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,100
I'll start with a greeting.

252
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:54,100
My face is a little short.

253
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,100
My face is a little short.

254
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:08,100
Happy New Year.

255
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:13,100
I look forward to working with you this year.

256
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:20,100
Thank you for coming to the temple today.

257
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:25,100
I'll do my best.

258
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,100
Please enjoy it.

259
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:39,100
First of all, I'll lick your ears.

260
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:55,100
I'll take all the bad things in your ears.

261
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:22,100
How do you feel?

262
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:28,100
I feel a lot better.

263
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:45,100
I feel like my ears are being cleaned.

264
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:51,100
I'm going to lick your ears.

265
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,100
My body is getting hot.

266
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:20,100
I'm going to lick your ears.

267
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:31,100
I'll make you feel good.

268
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,100
Wait a minute.

269
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:56,100
I'm going to lick your ears.

270
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:18,100
I'll make your ears and chin feel good.

271
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:39,100
I'll make your ears and chin feel good.

272
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:46,100
I'll make your ears and chin feel good.

273
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,100
Come closer.

274
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:15,100
I'll do it gently at first.

275
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,100
I'll do it gently at first.

276
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,100
I'll do it gently at first.

277
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:44,100
I'll make you feel good.

278
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:54,100
I only have you and me here now.

279
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:58,100
You don't have to hold your voice.

280
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:25,100
It feels good to be rubbed against the back of your head.

281
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:29,100
It feels good here, doesn't it?

282
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,100
It feels good.

283
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,100
It's okay.

284
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:11,100
I'll make you feel better.

285
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:21,100
I'll make your ears and chin feel good.

286
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,100
I'll lick your ears.

287
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,100
I'm thirsty.

288
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:46,100
I'll make you feel good.

289
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,100
It feels good.

290
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:26,100
I'll make your ears and chin feel good.

291
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:38,100
I'll make your ears and chin feel good.

292
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:46,100
I'll take all the bad things and go to bed.

293
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,100
Tickle tickle tickle.

294
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,100
The other side too.

295
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,100
It hurts.

296
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,100
It hurts.

297
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,100
Can't you take it anymore?

298
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,100
Kiss me.

299
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,100
If you can't take it anymore,

300
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,100
ask me for more.

301
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,100
Ask me.

302
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,100
I can't take it anymore,

303
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:14,100
so please make my day feel good.

304
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:20,100
Say it properly.

305
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,100
Kiss me.

306
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,100
Kiss me.

307
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,100
I can't take it anymore.

308
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,100
Kiss me.

309
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:10,100
Then, I'll give you a drink.

310
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,100
Wait.

311
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,100
You look so lonely.

312
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,100
Do you want to kiss me a little more?

313
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:38,100
I have a lot of bad things in my mouth.

314
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,100
I can't take it anymore.

315
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,100
Then, I'll make your day feel good.

316
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,100
It's hot.

317
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,100
I'll change the angle.

318
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,100
I'll give you a kiss.

319
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:24,100
Then, I'll give you a kiss in this angle.

320
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,100
I'll give you a kiss.

321
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,100
Kiss me.

322
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,100
I'll give you a kiss.

323
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,100
I'll give you a kiss.

324
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,100
I'll give you a kiss.

325
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,100
I can't give you a kiss yet.

326
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,100
I'm going to sleep.

327
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,100
Oh no, I'm getting a little wet.

328
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,100
Oh no, I'm getting a little wet.

329
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,100
What? Does it hurt?

330
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,100
You don't want me to move?

331
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,100
I wonder if you want to see it.

332
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,100
Kiss.

333
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:05,100
I'm going to put a lot of banana blotches on you.

334
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,100
I'll make you a bed.

335
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,100
I'm going to kiss you.

336
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,100
I'll kiss you.

337
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,100
It hurts.

338
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,100
I can't get it all in.

339
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:02,100
It's delicious.

340
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,100
I'll give you a little more.

341
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,100
I'll give you a little more.

342
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,100
I'm sleepy.

343
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:19,100
The smell of the banana blotches spread all over my mouth.

344
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,100
I'm getting really wet.

345
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,100
It hurts.

346
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,100
Your butt?

347
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,100
I want to see more of your butt.

348
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,100
I can't take it anymore.

349
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:04,100
Do you want to use my mouth?

350
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,100
I'll take it out.

351
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,100
Wait a minute.

352
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,100
Before I use my butt.

353
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,100
I'll use my butt.

354
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,100
I'll put a little bit of wet on you.

355
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,100
I'm going to kiss you.

356
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,100
I'm getting wet.

357
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,100
I'm getting wet.

358
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,100
I'm getting wet.

359
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,100
I'm sorry.

360
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,100
I love you.

361
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,100
I'll put it in your mouth.

362
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,100
I'm getting wet.

363
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,100
I'm getting wet.

364
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,100
I can't take it anymore.

365
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,100
I can't take it anymore.

366
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,100
I can't take it anymore.

367
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,100
I'm getting wet.

368
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,100
I'll count down for you.

369
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,100
I'm getting wet.

370
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,100
I'm getting wet.

371
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,100
Did you get wet?

372
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,100
I'm getting wet.

373
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,100
I'm getting wet.

374
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,100
I'm getting wet.

375
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,100
I'll show you what's inside my mouth.

376
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,100
Wait a minute.

377
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,100
I'll wipe it.

378
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,100
I'm getting wet.

379
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,100
I'm getting wet.

380
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,100
Look at my butt.

381
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,100
My butt is wriggling.

382
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,100
I'm getting wet.

383
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,100
I'll put it in your mouth.

384
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,100
I'll put it in your mouth.

385
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,100
There's a lot of water.

386
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,100
Did you get wet?

387
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,100
But I'm going to drink about half of it.

388
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,100
There's a lot of water.

389
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,100
So, are we going to feel good this time?

390
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,100
I'm going to feel good, too.

391
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,100
I'm getting wet.

392
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,100
I'm getting wet.

393
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,100
I'll wipe it.

394
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,100
I'm getting wet.

395
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,100
I'm getting wet.

396
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,100
I'm getting wet.

397
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,100
This time,

398
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,100
I'm going to feel good, too.

399
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,100
I've never done it before.

400
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,100
I've never done it before.

401
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,100
I'll do it.

402
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,100
I'll do it.

403
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,100
I'll do it.

404
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,100
I'm going to do it with Miko's clothes.

405
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,100
I'm going to do it with Miko's clothes.

406
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,100
I feel like I'm going to wear it.

407
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,100
Here.

408
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,100
About this much.

409
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,100
I'll put this in.

410
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,100
It's not a syringe.

411
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,100
I'll put two fingers in.

412
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,100
Two fingers.

413
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,100
I think it's a little thick.

414
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,100
Compared to this syringe,

415
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:20,100
I can't put it in.

416
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,100
Compared to this syringe,

417
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,100
I think it's a little thick.

418
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,100
Your syringe is thick.

419
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,100
It's thick.

420
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:34,100
I think it'll feel good.

421
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,100
I'm starting to dream.

422
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:40,100
Let's start dreaming together.

423
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,100
What should I do?

424
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,100
But before that,

425
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,100
I'm a little wet right now.

426
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,100
I'm already...

427
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:02,100
I'll let it go a little bit more.

428
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,100
I have to loosen it up a lot.

429
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,100
It's quite...

430
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,100
I think it's that.

431
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:28,100
Then, at first...

432
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,100
Hmm...

433
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,100
What should I do?

434
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:36,100
Since it's a special day, I'll take my time and relax.

435
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:40,100
Take my time.

436
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,100
Look at my breasts.

437
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,100
My breasts are really...

438
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,100
They're all wrinkled.

439
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,100
They're really wrinkled.

440
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,100
It's a bit difficult, but...

441
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,100
Then, today...

442
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:01,100
I'll use this egg.

443
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:03,100
Egg.

444
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,100
This is...

445
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,100
What kind of thing is this?

446
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:29,100
Long-term brushing stimulation.

447
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,100
It's called a long-term.

448
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,100
What does it feel like?

449
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:36,100
I'll open it up.

450
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:51,100
Wow!

451
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,100
It's like a mojatto ball.

452
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,100
This is bad.

453
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:00,100
This is the root of the bad thing.

454
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:02,100
This is bad.

455
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,100
It's not good.

456
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:09,100
Since I'm a shrine maiden, I can't lose to this.

457
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,100
What? Is it Japanese?

458
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:15,100
I can't lose to this.

459
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:17,100
So...

460
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,100
I'll use it.

461
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,100
I wonder how it feels.

462
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:24,100
Then, this...

463
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:27,100
Last time, before that...

464
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:31,100
When I used this, it was a bit...

465
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:36,100
It felt good, but it felt like it lasted longer.

466
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,100
It felt like that.

467
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,100
This time, look, this is a special lotion.

468
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,100
It's really sticky.

469
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,100
It feels good.

470
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,100
This...

471
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,100
Rub, rub.

472
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:56,100
I'll use this.

473
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:00,100
I'll put it here.

474
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:06,100
It feels good already.

475
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:09,100
It already feels good.

476
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,100
Rub, rub, rub.

477
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,100
A lie detector.

478
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,100
Huh?

479
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:24,100
Then, I'll flip this over.

480
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:26,100
And do this.

481
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,100
Huh? This...

482
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,100
I can do it somehow, right?

483
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,100
It's in the frame.

484
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:42,100
But I can do it somehow.

485
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,100
So, today, I'll do it specially.

486
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,100
I'll take it off.

487
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,100
The bandage.

488
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:57,100
Hide the H-line.

489
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:03,100
Wait.

490
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,100
I took it off.

491
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,100
I took it off.

492
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:20,100
Then, now...

493
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:22,100
I'll do it without the bandage.

494
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,100
Without the bandage.

495
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:27,100
I'll hide it with this H-line.

496
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:34,100
It feels good.

497
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:39,100
Then, slowly, slowly...

498
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,100
I'll do it slowly.

499
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,100
Ah...

500
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:50,100
It's so slippery.

501
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:53,100
I'll rub it all over.

502
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,100
Today...

503
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,100
I want to do it while rubbing my boobs.

504
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:13,100
But my boobs are hard.

505
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:15,100
It's hard, right?

506
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:17,100
My boobs are hard.

507
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:25,100
It's out.

508
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:35,100
Just now, the panties...

509
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,100
Not panties, the swimsuits...

510
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:39,100
I took them off.

511
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:41,100
But, after all...

512
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:45,100
I thought it would be better to see it.

513
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:48,100
So, like this...

514
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:50,100
I'll do it while showing it.

515
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:52,100
Like this.

516
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:55,100
My mouth is probably...

517
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:58,100
You're excited, too, right?

518
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:04,100
Then...

519
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,100
With this...

520
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:09,100
Like this...

521
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,100
Then, lend me your ears.

522
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:28,100
I'll do it from here.

523
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:40,100
Ah... It feels good.

524
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:45,100
I'll rub it all over.

525
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:51,100
Can I touch your nipples?

526
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,100
This is really... How should I say it?

527
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:04,100
It's really relaxing.

528
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:07,100
Look at the screen.

529
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:22,100
I'll take the nipples off.

530
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:36,100
It feels good.

531
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:50,100
I'll rub it all over.

532
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:03,100
This is bad.

533
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,100
I don't want to put it in.

534
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,100
I'll put my fingers in.

535
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:28,100
Wait a minute.

536
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,100
I don't want to put my fingers in.

537
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:33,100
This feels good.

538
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:35,100
It's hot.

539
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:38,100
I'll take two fingers and loosen it.

540
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:48,100
A lot.

541
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,100
I'll put it on.

542
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,100
I'll put my fingers in.

543
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:17,100
This is bad.

544
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:26,100
It feels good.

545
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:35,100
This is bad.

546
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:37,100
I don't want to put my fingers in.

547
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:44,100
What should I do?

548
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,100
This is bad.

549
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:16,100
This feels good.

550
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,100
This is bad.

551
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:33,100
This is bad.

552
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:39,100
Looking at this one finger,

553
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:42,100
I'm getting nervous again.

554
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:49,100
Miko-san is getting excited with this kind of heat.

555
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:59,100
This is bad.

556
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:01,100
This feels good.

557
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,100
This is bad.

558
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:31,100
A lot.

559
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:40,100
This is bad.

560
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,100
I'll do it.

561
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:58,100
This is bad.

562
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:01,100
I'll do it lightly.

563
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:07,100
This is really sticky.

564
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:13,100
I'll do it lightly.

565
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:15,100
Wait a minute.

566
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:18,100
I'll put something on.

567
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:24,100
I want to use this too.

568
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:28,100
I'll be in the frame.

569
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:33,100
I'll use a massage device.

570
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:36,100
Massage device.

571
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:43,100
I want to use the massage device next.

572
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:45,100
Wait a minute.

573
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:49,100
I want to relax.

574
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:12,100
I can't lick your ears.

575
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:18,100
I can't lick your ears at this height.

576
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:22,100
This time,

577
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:26,100
I'll use a massage device.

578
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:28,100
Massage device.

579
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:30,100
I'll do it.

580
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:33,100
I'm happy.

581
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:35,100
I'm happy.

582
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:37,100
I'm happy.

583
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:39,100
I'm happy.

584
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:42,100
I'm happy.

585
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:54,100
Wait a minute.

586
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:05,100
This is bad.

587
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:12,100
This is bad.

588
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:21,100
I'll do it.

589
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:43,100
This is bad.

590
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:12,100
This is bad.

591
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:29,100
I don't want to do it anymore.

592
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:31,100
I'll sleep with this.

593
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:38,100
This...

594
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:42,100
I'll do it while I'm in the frame.

595
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:58,100
Then,

596
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:02,100
I'll put you in the frame.

597
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:12,100
Here we go.

598
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:33,100
Punch.

599
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:42,100
Punch.

600
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,100
I'm embarrassed.

601
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:12,100
Here we go.

602
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:16,100
Then,

603
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:20,100
I'll put you in the frame.

604
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:31,100
My heart is pounding.

605
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:33,100
I'll do it.

606
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:41,100
I'll do it.

607
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:43,100
I'm not good at punching.

608
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:47,100
I'll put you in the frame again.

609
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:52,100
This is bad.

610
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:03,100
This is bad.

611
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:15,100
I'll sleep with this.

612
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:34,100
This is bad.

613
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:42,100
I'll do it again.

614
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:56,100
I'll do it again.

615
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:03,100
I'm still in the frame.

616
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:33,100
Wait a minute.

617
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:35,100
I'll do it again.

618
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,100
This is really hard.

619
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:03,100
This is bad.

620
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:17,100
I feel like I'm in the frame.

621
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:21,100
I feel like I'm in the frame.

622
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:25,100
My face is shaking.

623
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:33,100
My face is shaking.

624
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:49,100
My face is shaking.

625
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:51,100
My face is shaking.

626
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:01,100
More.

627
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:21,100
I'm in the frame.

628
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:29,100
I'm in the frame.

629
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:51,100
I feel good.

630
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:13,100
Help me.

631
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:21,100
This is bad.

632
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:33,100
This is bad.

633
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:51,100
This is bad.

634
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:57,100
This is bad.

635
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:21,100
I'm out.

636
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:27,100
I'm out.

637
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:29,100
I was shaking.

638
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:37,100
I'm in the frame.

639
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:43,100
I'm in the frame.

640
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:51,100
I'm in the frame.

641
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:53,100
I'm in the frame.

642
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:09,100
Wait a minute.

643
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:21,100
I feel good.

644
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:29,100
I'm in the frame.

645
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:35,100
I'm in the frame.

646
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:51,100
Wait a minute.

647
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:59,100
I'll do it again.

648
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:03,100
I'll do it again.

649
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:13,100
I'll do it again.

650
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:21,100
I'm in the frame.

651
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:29,100
I'm in the frame.

652
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:41,100
I'm in the frame.

653
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:51,100
I'm in the frame.

654
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:55,100
I'm in the frame.

655
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:09,100
I did it.

656
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:11,100
I feel good.

657
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:13,100
I did it.

658
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:15,100
Wait a minute.

659
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:21,100
I'm satisfied.

660
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:41,100
It's harder than usual.

661
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:45,100
There are times like that.

662
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:51,100
I feel good.

663
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:01,100
Camera.

664
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:07,100
I'm in the frame.

665
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:09,100
I'm in the frame.

666
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:17,100
My hair is sweaty.

667
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:19,100
My hands are sweaty.

668
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:21,100
I'm in the frame.

669
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:47,100
This is a heart.

670
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:49,100
It's a little slanted.

671
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:51,100
Slanted.

672
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:09,100
Then,

673
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:11,100
in a different angle,

674
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:13,100
in a different angle,

675
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:17,100
I'll do the eyes.

676
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:19,100
I always do it in this angle.

677
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:21,100
I can see your face.

678
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:23,100
I'm scared.

679
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:25,100
I'll do it from the bottom.

680
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:29,100
I'll take a break.

681
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:43,100
I'm in the frame.

682
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:51,100
This angle.

683
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:53,100
I'm scared.

684
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:55,100
I'm from the bottom.

685
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:57,100
I'm scared.

686
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:59,100
I'll try it.

687
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:03,100
I don't think it's in.

688
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:13,100
I'll take it off.

689
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:15,100
I'll take it off.

690
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:41,100
I forgot to turn off the air conditioner.

691
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:43,100
I forgot to turn off the air conditioner.

692
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:51,100
I'm taking a break.

693
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:57,100
I'll be quiet.

694
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:59,100
I'm in the frame.

695
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:13,100
I can see a lot of places.

696
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:15,100
I'm in the frame.

697
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:21,100
I'm in the frame.

698
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:29,100
It's really slanted.

699
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:33,100
It's really slanted.

700
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:35,100
Maybe it's because of the sweat.

701
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:37,100
This hair is inside out.

702
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:39,100
It's a beautiful hand roll.

703
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:41,100
I'm worried.

704
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:59,100
I think I'm tired from behind.

705
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:01,100
I'm tired from behind.

706
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:07,100
I took something off.

707
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:09,100
Can I take this off?

708
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:11,100
It's torn.

709
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:15,100
It's torn.

710
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:19,100
I couldn't stand the pressure.

711
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:29,100
I'll do a female shampoo at the end.

712
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:31,100
I'll do a female shampoo.

713
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:37,100
I'll lick your ears a lot.

714
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:39,100
I'll give you a lot.

715
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:41,100
I'll give you a lot.

716
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:01,100
I'll squeeze your hair until the end.

717
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:03,100
I'll squeeze your hair until the end.

718
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:09,100
I've squeezed it out of the chin.

719
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:13,100
Lastly, I'll finish with a lip tape kiss.

720
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:15,100
Finally, I'll finish with a lip tape kiss.

721
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:31,100
I'll do it again.

722
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:57,100
I'm not going to be able to do it.

723
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:59,100
I'll do it again.

724
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:01,100
This is the only part.

725
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:05,100
I can only show you.

726
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:07,100
I'll do it again.

727
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:27,100
It's delicious.

728
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:37,100
I love you.

729
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:45,100
I love you.

730
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:49,100
Thanks to you,

731
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:53,100
I'm alive.

732
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:57,100
I'll be with you forever.

733
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:07,100
I love you.

734
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:19,100
I love you.

735
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:21,100
I love you.

736
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:37,100
It's delicious.

737
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:39,100
It's delicious.

738
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:09,100
I'll give you a lot.

739
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:13,100
I'll give you a lot.

740
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:15,100
I'll give you a lot.

741
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:39,100
I'll give you a lot.

742
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:05,100
I love you.

743
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:09,100
I love you.

744
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:23,100
I love you.

745
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:25,100
I love you.

746
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:31,100
I love you.

747
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:38,620
Breathe.

748
01:21:08,020 --> 01:21:08,760
Okay...

749
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:10,160
Kiss...

750
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:26,600
Hugyoo...

751
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:41,100
Wait, I'm curious about this.

752
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:43,100
I'm curious.

753
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:53,100
I love you, I love you, I love you.

754
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:59,100
I feel refreshed today.

755
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:03,100
If I feel refreshed even a little,

756
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:06,100
I'm happy.

757
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:11,100
I hope you'll be happy.

758
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:30,100
Then I'll count down.

759
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:32,100
I'll start with 10 seconds.

760
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:35,100
Open your mouth wide.

761
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:39,100
It's refreshing.

762
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:41,100
I'm going to eat this.

763
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:47,100
10 seconds.

764
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:03,100
9.

765
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:10,100
8.

766
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:23,100
7.

767
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:34,100
6.

768
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:40,100
7.

769
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:42,100
8.

770
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:57,100
9.

771
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:08,100
3.

772
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:12,100
Open your mouth.

773
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:21,100
2.

774
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:33,100
1.

775
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:36,100
Open your mouth wide.

776
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:42,100
2.

777
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:50,100
1.

778
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:52,100
1.

779
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:12,100
1.

780
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:37,100
Even if I become zero, I'll kiss you forever.

781
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:41,100
Even if I become zero, I'll kiss you forever.

782
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:51,100
I'm sweating.

783
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:12,100
I feel refreshed with this outfit.

784
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:15,100
I can see my face.

785
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:17,100
Today...

786
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:19,100
Wait, I can't see.

787
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:21,100
I'll edit this.

788
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:25,100
I can see my chin.

789
01:26:33,100 --> 01:26:35,100
I'm glad I called you.

790
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:39,100
I'm a little...

791
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:46,100
Well, I don't know.

792
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:52,100
I'm a little...

793
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:55,100
I'm a little...

794
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:58,100
I'm a little...

795
01:26:58,100 --> 01:27:00,100
I'm a little...

796
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:05,100
I'm a little different from usual.

797
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:07,100
How was it?

798
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:15,100
I'm glad I felt a little better.

799
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:18,100
I'm a little...

800
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:22,100
I'm a little hard to breathe.

801
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:24,100
It's hard to breathe.

802
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:26,100
It's hard to breathe in life, but it's not.

803
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:28,100
It's a little...

804
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:30,100
Yeah, it's a little...

805
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:34,100
It's hard to breathe.

806
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:39,100
But I spent a lot of time today.

807
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:42,100
I spent a lot of time today.

808
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:47,100
It felt good.

809
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:50,100
I don't know.

810
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:56,100
I think it would have been bad if I did a live stream.

811
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:59,100
I think I could have done a live stream.

812
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:01,100
I think it was a little weird.

813
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:07,100
I'm glad we felt good together while taking a break today.

814
01:28:09,100 --> 01:28:11,100
I'm glad.

815
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:13,100
I'm glad we felt good together while taking a break today.

816
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:30,100
Then, let's...

817
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:32,100
Then, let's...

818
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:40,100
I look like an anime character.

819
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:43,100
I look like an anime character.

820
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:51,100
This is...

821
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:53,100
I'm a little...

822
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:57,100
I'm a little...

823
01:28:57,100 --> 01:28:59,100
I'm a little...

824
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:02,100
I'm a little...

825
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:05,100
My face is...

826
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:13,100
I'm a little...

827
01:29:19,100 --> 01:29:21,100
I'm wearing this.

828
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:23,100
I'm wearing this.

829
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:26,100
1

830
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:28,100
1

831
01:29:34,100 --> 01:29:36,100
I can see a lot.

832
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:43,100
1

833
01:29:51,100 --> 01:29:53,100
It's big.

834
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:56,100
My head is going crazy.

835
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:13,100
1

836
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:15,100
1

837
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:17,100
1

838
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:19,100
1

839
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:21,100
1

840
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:23,100
1

841
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:25,100
1

842
01:30:25,100 --> 01:30:27,100
1

843
01:30:27,100 --> 01:30:29,100
1

844
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:31,100
1

845
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:33,100
1

846
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:35,100
1

847
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:37,100
1

848
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:39,100
1

849
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:41,100
I'm back.

850
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:43,100
I'm back.

851
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:49,100
It's February 1, 2024.

852
01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:51,100
It's February 1, 2024.

853
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:53,100
It's 33 minutes.

854
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:01,100
I watched the whole thing.

855
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:03,100
I watched the whole thing.

856
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:05,100
Everyone's reaction was funny.

857
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:07,100
Everyone's reaction was funny.

858
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:09,100
I've been watching it a little bit.

859
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:11,100
I've been watching it a little bit.

860
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:13,100
I'm worried if it's going to stop.

861
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:15,100
I'm worried if it's going to stop.

862
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:19,100
It's like I'm back.

863
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:21,100
I'm like a pruneriff.

864
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:23,100
I'm like a pruneriff.

865
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:25,100
A place where it feels like a pruneriff.

866
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:27,100
A place where it feels like a pruneriff.

867
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:29,100
Again,

868
01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:31,100
No, this is...

869
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:33,100
a break

870
01:31:33,100 --> 01:31:35,100
a break

871
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:38,220
I did it, so I edited it a bit.

872
01:31:39,180 --> 01:31:43,940
Yeah, that's how I saw it.

873
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:46,500
Was it embarrassing?

874
01:31:55,700 --> 01:31:57,700
The underwear was in it.

875
01:31:57,700 --> 01:32:01,380
Yeah, underwear, underwear, underwear, underwear.

876
01:32:01,380 --> 01:32:07,700
I thought I took off my swimsuit, but I'm going to talk about what happened.

877
01:32:08,860 --> 01:32:16,820
I thought I took off my underwear and swimsuit, but I was wearing it.

878
01:32:16,820 --> 01:32:20,740
Yeah, that's what I thought.

879
01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:24,620
Let's talk about the pillow.

880
01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:27,500
What should I do? Pillow talk video...

881
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:28,220
Is this it?

882
01:32:29,220 --> 01:32:31,580
I didn't turn on the air conditioner.

883
01:32:31,580 --> 01:32:36,100
I didn't turn on the air conditioner because I turned it on earlier.

884
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:37,620
Let's talk about it.

885
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:40,140
Let's talk about it.

886
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:42,460
How was it? First of all,

887
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:48,740
I was a little irregular this time, but I was a little like a recording.

888
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:51,780
Yes, it was like a simultaneous viewing.

889
01:32:51,780 --> 01:32:53,340
Oh, I should have blown my butt.

890
01:32:53,340 --> 01:32:57,260
I'm a little scared to do that kind of live broadcast.

891
01:32:57,700 --> 01:33:08,300
I can't cut the abs scene, so I didn't cut it.

892
01:33:08,980 --> 01:33:10,500
Yeah, it was rare.

893
01:33:12,540 --> 01:33:14,300
Was it good to see the angle from below?

894
01:33:14,900 --> 01:33:15,780
Really?

895
01:33:16,620 --> 01:33:20,660
Oh, my butt was a little bit of a bite.

896
01:33:20,660 --> 01:33:25,940
Yeah, I was eating my bare swimsuit and eating it.

897
01:33:25,940 --> 01:33:30,780
And I don't do much, but after I ate it, I put my back on it.

898
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:35,500
I'll show you a little bit of my thighs.

899
01:33:35,820 --> 01:33:40,260
Yeah, yeah, that's kind of like an accident.

900
01:33:41,260 --> 01:33:43,220
I wonder if it's okay.

901
01:33:44,220 --> 01:33:46,460
I felt a lot of things.

902
01:33:46,460 --> 01:33:49,180
Really? That's great.

903
01:33:50,180 --> 01:33:53,340
Of course, I think the live broadcast is the best.

904
01:33:53,700 --> 01:33:57,660
Well, I'm really in good shape to record.

905
01:33:58,100 --> 01:34:05,260
I'm trying to make it a means of helping when I'm not feeling well.

906
01:34:06,540 --> 01:34:07,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

907
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:11,140
Oh, really.

908
01:34:11,140 --> 01:34:12,300
I didn't know Miko was there.

909
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:24,380
The last part of Miko's hair was like a shaggy character.

910
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:31,300
Nagachichi is like a shaggy character.

911
01:34:31,300 --> 01:34:32,700
I thought so, too.

912
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:36,140
The flow was smooth, but one thing.

913
01:34:37,020 --> 01:34:40,700
Everyone, well, everyone.

914
01:34:40,700 --> 01:34:42,540
Well, looking at you.

915
01:34:42,540 --> 01:34:45,020
Yeah, what I thought when I saw you.

916
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:51,620
I feel like it's going to be a little hard without a break.

917
01:34:52,340 --> 01:35:01,740
Yeah, so if I'm going to record it in the future,

918
01:35:02,220 --> 01:35:06,980
Well, it's almost an hour and a half, isn't it?

919
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:19,740
It's almost an hour and a half, so I thought it would be okay to take a break for a while.

920
01:35:19,740 --> 01:35:28,940
Yeah, well, I don't know if I'll make it live or record it.

921
01:35:28,940 --> 01:35:33,380
I think it's okay for me to do both.

922
01:35:33,380 --> 01:35:43,540
The reason I couldn't do the live broadcast was because I was having a hard time breathing.

923
01:35:44,940 --> 01:35:49,340
I was really depressed.

924
01:35:49,740 --> 01:35:57,740
I'm having a mental illness right now.

925
01:35:57,740 --> 01:36:00,220
I'm taking some medicine.

926
01:36:00,220 --> 01:36:03,900
I'm taking new medicine right now.

927
01:36:03,900 --> 01:36:07,180
I'm having a hard time breathing.

928
01:36:07,180 --> 01:36:10,180
Yeah, it's basically a live broadcast.

929
01:36:10,180 --> 01:36:11,340
Of course, of course, of course.

930
01:36:11,340 --> 01:36:15,260
I'll try to make it live this month.

931
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:17,460
This month? Oh, this month.

932
01:36:17,460 --> 01:36:19,940
Yeah, it's hard to breathe.

933
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:23,060
Yeah, I have sexual desire.

934
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:25,860
Well, I don't have it, but I have sexual desire.

935
01:36:25,860 --> 01:36:27,940
It's hard to breathe.

936
01:36:27,940 --> 01:36:33,660
Especially on live broadcasts, I'm really serious in a weird place.

937
01:36:33,660 --> 01:36:37,700
Well, how do I say this?

938
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:44,300
There may be men, but I'm a shitty girl from the beginning.

939
01:36:44,300 --> 01:36:49,180
I'm a

940
01:36:49,180 --> 01:36:50,740
I'm a slut, but I'm a slut, but I'm a slut.

941
01:36:50,740 --> 01:36:54,420
That's a little pressure.

942
01:36:54,420 --> 01:37:03,300
Yeah, well, everyone's looking forward to it.

943
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:04,540
Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

944
01:37:04,540 --> 01:37:06,740
You said you liked me.

945
01:37:06,740 --> 01:37:10,980
So I want to feel good and I want to feel good.

946
01:37:10,980 --> 01:37:14,860
I feel like I'm going to die.

947
01:37:14,860 --> 01:37:21,500
I don't know if it's going to be hard to breathe.

948
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:30,660
Maybe there's someone who's worried about my ED.

949
01:37:30,660 --> 01:37:34,620
I'm starting to feel like that.

950
01:37:34,620 --> 01:37:39,060
Well, I had you put together for about an hour and 20 minutes this time.

951
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:41,380
Actually, it's already been a long time.

952
01:37:41,380 --> 01:37:44,100
Two and a half hours or something.

953
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:48,420
I was taking a break from a very long break.

954
01:37:48,420 --> 01:37:54,060
I was editing the video while I was resting.

955
01:37:54,060 --> 01:38:01,900
So, I thought it would be better to record it this time.

956
01:38:01,900 --> 01:38:07,740
I couldn't do it live, but I probably couldn't.

957
01:38:07,740 --> 01:38:12,860
I can't do it, but I have to finish the live in three hours.

958
01:38:12,860 --> 01:38:16,660
I was a little like, wow.

959
01:38:16,660 --> 01:38:18,580
But I was happy.

960
01:38:18,580 --> 01:38:22,940
When I saw the comments, I was like,

961
01:38:22,940 --> 01:38:24,380
It was a little hard to breathe.

962
01:38:24,380 --> 01:38:27,700
When we talked,

963
01:38:27,700 --> 01:38:32,900
But that's what I'm proud of.

964
01:38:32,900 --> 01:38:34,900
I'm proud of what I've said.

965
01:38:34,900 --> 01:38:37,860
I was so happy to hear that you said,

966
01:38:37,860 --> 01:38:38,940
I'm so happy.

967
01:38:38,940 --> 01:38:41,140
I'm crying.

968
01:38:41,140 --> 01:38:43,980
What do you mean?

969
01:38:43,980 --> 01:38:46,380
I'm wearing glasses right now.

970
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:48,860
I'm being careful.

971
01:38:48,860 --> 01:38:50,300
I was a little happy.

972
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:52,060
I was proud.

973
01:38:52,060 --> 01:38:55,220
It took me a while.

974
01:38:55,220 --> 01:38:58,300
I'm being chased by the time of the hotel.

975
01:38:58,300 --> 01:39:03,900
Is there a time for a hotel?

976
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:05,220
I'm glad I could go.

977
01:39:11,220 --> 01:39:21,300
I want to make you feel better.

978
01:39:21,300 --> 01:39:23,500
I want to be myself.

979
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:31,100
I want to cherish this time more and more.

980
01:39:31,100 --> 01:39:40,460
I'm not feeling well.

981
01:39:40,460 --> 01:39:44,940
But I'm taking my medicine.

982
01:39:44,940 --> 01:39:47,380
Can I talk about the hospital I went to today?

983
01:39:47,380 --> 01:39:49,060
I'm so serious.

984
01:39:49,060 --> 01:39:54,620
I really talked about it at the hospital.

985
01:39:54,620 --> 01:39:58,140
The hospital I went to today was a female nurse.

986
01:39:58,140 --> 01:40:01,860
The nurse was a woman.

987
01:40:01,860 --> 01:40:05,860
The doctor was a woman.

988
01:40:05,860 --> 01:40:07,540
Everyone was a woman.

989
01:40:07,540 --> 01:40:09,020
I chose that place.

990
01:40:09,020 --> 01:40:15,820
I don't like men.

991
01:40:15,820 --> 01:40:19,540
The hospital I went to for the first time.

992
01:40:19,540 --> 01:40:28,820
I went to a big hospital.

993
01:40:28,820 --> 01:40:34,220
I didn't feel well.

994
01:40:34,220 --> 01:40:36,340
Is it a woman?

995
01:40:36,340 --> 01:40:38,900
I don't think it's a woman.

996
01:40:38,900 --> 01:40:41,340
There was a man.

997
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:48,820
I'm looking forward to men coming to the hospital.

998
01:40:48,820 --> 01:40:54,780
I'm glad the woman is a woman.

999
01:40:54,780 --> 01:40:59,420
It's good to go to the hospital.

1000
01:40:59,420 --> 01:41:04,700
I thought it would be easier to talk to a woman.

1001
01:41:04,700 --> 01:41:07,620
I went to the hospital.

1002
01:41:07,620 --> 01:41:10,580
I was diagnosed with this disease at the previous hospital.

1003
01:41:10,580 --> 01:41:13,300
I was taking this medicine.

1004
01:41:14,260 --> 01:41:20,300
The nurse was listening to me.

1005
01:41:20,300 --> 01:41:26,340
The nurse was talking to me.

1006
01:41:26,340 --> 01:41:30,940
I was a little nervous.

1007
01:41:30,940 --> 01:41:36,940
I was aware of the symptoms of the disease in the fall of 2022.

1008
01:41:36,940 --> 01:41:41,220
I was nervous.

1009
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:46,540
I was nervous.

1010
01:41:46,540 --> 01:41:52,380
I was nervous.

1011
01:41:52,380 --> 01:41:55,340
I was nervous.

1012
01:41:55,340 --> 01:42:00,420
I gave the story I just told to the nurse.

1013
01:42:00,420 --> 01:42:03,180
I told her to tell me the story.

1014
01:42:03,180 --> 01:42:05,260
I told her to think about the medicine.

1015
01:42:05,260 --> 01:42:07,660
I waited in the waiting room.

1016
01:42:07,660 --> 01:42:10,940
I went to the hospital in the morning.

1017
01:42:10,940 --> 01:42:13,420
I went to the hospital in the morning.

1018
01:42:13,420 --> 01:42:16,540
The nurse was in my room.

1019
01:42:16,540 --> 01:42:23,980
The nurse was very lively.

1020
01:42:23,980 --> 01:42:27,820
She had perfect makeup.

1021
01:42:27,820 --> 01:42:29,500
She wrote a job.

1022
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:32,460
What kind of job is it?

1023
01:42:32,460 --> 01:42:35,500
I was surprised.

1024
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:37,260
I had to say something.

1025
01:42:37,260 --> 01:42:46,340
I was a little surprised.

1026
01:42:46,340 --> 01:42:48,900
I was surprised.

1027
01:42:48,900 --> 01:42:52,620
I was surprised.

1028
01:42:52,620 --> 01:42:57,820
I was surprised.

1029
01:42:57,820 --> 01:43:00,820
I was surprised.

1030
01:43:00,820 --> 01:43:04,100
Youtube finds it otro.

1031
01:43:04,100 --> 01:43:26,740
I don't understand

1032
01:43:26,740 --> 01:43:29,380
the truth.

1033
01:43:29,380 --> 01:43:34,380
I've been asked a lot of questions.

1034
01:43:34,380 --> 01:43:37,380
I've been asked to tell me the channel name.

1035
01:43:37,380 --> 01:43:41,380
I was told that it was hard and I would be on your side.

1036
01:43:41,380 --> 01:43:44,380
I was told to tell me the channel name.

1037
01:43:44,380 --> 01:43:49,380
I was embarrassed.

1038
01:43:49,380 --> 01:43:53,380
But I became a good person.

1039
01:43:54,380 --> 01:44:01,380
I'm worried that the medicine will change.

1040
01:44:01,380 --> 01:44:06,380
I'm sleepy and worried.

1041
01:44:06,380 --> 01:44:09,380
I want to get better.

1042
01:44:09,380 --> 01:44:15,380
I've been feeling down lately.

1043
01:44:15,380 --> 01:44:21,380
I'm affected by various things.

1044
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:26,380
I was influenced by fan clubs and Niconico.

1045
01:44:26,380 --> 01:44:31,380
I'm working in a business.

1046
01:44:31,380 --> 01:44:34,380
I was influenced by my job.

1047
01:44:34,380 --> 01:44:40,380
I'm not good at being myself.

1048
01:44:40,380 --> 01:44:44,380
I'm not good at being myself.

1049
01:44:44,380 --> 01:44:49,380
I'm not good at working.

1050
01:44:50,380 --> 01:44:55,380
I'm not good at anything.

1051
01:44:55,380 --> 01:45:01,380
But the doctor was kind.

1052
01:45:01,380 --> 01:45:04,380
Everyone is kind.

1053
01:45:04,380 --> 01:45:08,380
I'll be treated.

1054
01:45:08,380 --> 01:45:11,380
I'll be treated.

1055
01:45:20,380 --> 01:45:24,380
This is not a sad tear.

1056
01:45:24,380 --> 01:45:27,380
This is a happy tear.

1057
01:45:27,380 --> 01:45:29,380
Everyone is kind.

1058
01:45:29,380 --> 01:45:32,380
I really like it.

1059
01:45:32,380 --> 01:45:35,380
Everyone is cute.

1060
01:45:35,380 --> 01:45:38,380
I was scared in the comments.

1061
01:45:38,380 --> 01:45:43,380
I can't go to the video.

1062
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:47,380
I don't like it at all.

1063
01:45:48,380 --> 01:45:52,380
What if I say, I don't like it.

1064
01:45:52,380 --> 01:45:56,380
What if I say, I don't like it.

1065
01:45:56,380 --> 01:46:01,380
The comments are funny.

1066
01:46:01,380 --> 01:46:06,380
When I was doing a push-up, I laughed.

1067
01:46:06,380 --> 01:46:10,380
I laughed at the past.

1068
01:46:10,380 --> 01:46:16,380
I laughed.

1069
01:46:17,380 --> 01:46:21,380
I thought it was cute.

1070
01:46:27,380 --> 01:46:30,380
I thought I should trust everyone.

1071
01:46:30,380 --> 01:46:33,380
I'm always negative.

1072
01:46:33,380 --> 01:46:36,380
I'm always negative.

1073
01:46:36,380 --> 01:46:39,380
I'm always negative.

1074
01:46:39,380 --> 01:46:42,380
I'm always negative.

1075
01:46:43,380 --> 01:46:46,380
I'm always negative.

1076
01:46:46,380 --> 01:46:49,380
I'm always negative.

1077
01:46:49,380 --> 01:46:52,380
I want to accept that I'm bad.

1078
01:46:52,380 --> 01:46:55,380
I want to accept that I'm bad.

1079
01:46:55,380 --> 01:46:58,380
Why am I so bad?

1080
01:46:58,380 --> 01:47:02,380
Everyone thinks so.

1081
01:47:02,380 --> 01:47:05,380
I want to lower myself.

1082
01:47:05,380 --> 01:47:09,380
I want to lower myself.

1083
01:47:09,380 --> 01:47:14,380
I think this is a kind of self-defeating act.

1084
01:47:14,380 --> 01:47:16,380
I'm going to push it.

1085
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:20,380
I want to do it properly.

1086
01:47:22,380 --> 01:47:27,380
Everyone likes me more than that.

1087
01:47:27,380 --> 01:47:32,380
I want to believe that.

1088
01:47:32,380 --> 01:47:35,380
I want to believe that.

1089
01:47:35,380 --> 01:47:38,380
I want to believe that.

1090
01:47:38,380 --> 01:47:41,380
Thank you.

1091
01:47:41,380 --> 01:47:46,380
I'm not sure what to do next February.

1092
01:47:46,380 --> 01:47:49,380
I was a cat last year.

1093
01:47:49,380 --> 01:47:52,380
I was a cat last year.

1094
01:47:52,380 --> 01:47:54,380
Is there a picture?

1095
01:47:54,380 --> 01:47:57,380
Can I show you a picture?

1096
01:47:57,380 --> 01:48:00,380
Wait a minute.

1097
01:48:02,380 --> 01:48:04,380
I drink water.

1098
01:48:04,380 --> 01:48:07,380
I was a cat.

1099
01:48:07,380 --> 01:48:10,380
I was a cat.

1100
01:48:10,380 --> 01:48:13,380
I was a cat.

1101
01:48:13,380 --> 01:48:16,380
I was a cat.

1102
01:48:16,380 --> 01:48:19,380
I was a cat.

1103
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:22,380
I'm climbing a slope.

1104
01:48:22,380 --> 01:48:25,380
I'm climbing a slope.

1105
01:48:25,380 --> 01:48:28,380
Which one?

1106
01:48:28,380 --> 01:48:30,380
This is May.

1107
01:48:30,380 --> 01:48:33,380
I'm climbing a slope.

1108
01:48:33,380 --> 01:48:35,380
This is March.

1109
01:48:35,380 --> 01:48:37,380
This is around here.

1110
01:48:37,380 --> 01:48:40,380
Wait a minute.

1111
01:48:40,380 --> 01:48:43,380
This is around here.

1112
01:48:45,380 --> 01:48:47,380
This is January.

1113
01:48:47,380 --> 01:48:49,380
Is there a picture?

1114
01:48:49,380 --> 01:48:51,380
What?

1115
01:48:51,380 --> 01:48:52,380
No?

1116
01:48:52,380 --> 01:48:53,380
It's gone.

1117
01:48:53,380 --> 01:48:56,380
There is no cat picture.

1118
01:48:56,380 --> 01:48:59,380
I'm a cute cat.

1119
01:48:59,380 --> 01:49:00,380
This?

1120
01:49:00,380 --> 01:49:02,380
This is it.

1121
01:49:02,380 --> 01:49:04,380
There is a picture.

1122
01:49:04,380 --> 01:49:07,380
There are 10 pictures on the thumbnail.

1123
01:49:07,380 --> 01:49:09,380
What does that mean?

1124
01:49:09,380 --> 01:49:12,380
Why is there a picture?

1125
01:49:12,380 --> 01:49:14,380
There is a picture.

1126
01:49:14,380 --> 01:49:15,380
This is it.

1127
01:49:15,380 --> 01:49:18,380
This is the picture from last year.

1128
01:49:18,380 --> 01:49:20,380
This is not it.

1129
01:49:20,380 --> 01:49:23,380
This is February.

1130
01:49:23,380 --> 01:49:25,380
I think so.

1131
01:49:25,380 --> 01:49:28,380
I think it's February.

1132
01:49:28,380 --> 01:49:31,380
It's a new year's fortune.

1133
01:49:31,380 --> 01:49:32,380
Tiger pattern?

1134
01:49:32,380 --> 01:49:35,380
A leopard pattern cosplay.

1135
01:49:35,380 --> 01:49:40,380
I think I'm wearing a high-resolution costume.

1136
01:49:40,380 --> 01:49:43,380
This is last year.

1137
01:49:43,380 --> 01:49:44,380
Last year?

1138
01:49:44,380 --> 01:49:47,380
What should I do this year?

1139
01:49:47,380 --> 01:49:48,380
What should I do?

1140
01:49:48,380 --> 01:49:50,380
Long hair until March.

1141
01:49:50,380 --> 01:49:56,380
April is a change of mood.

1142
01:49:56,380 --> 01:49:59,380
I cut my hair last April.

1143
01:49:59,380 --> 01:50:01,380
Is that right?

1144
01:50:01,380 --> 01:50:03,380
Is that right?

1145
01:50:03,380 --> 01:50:05,380
Is that right?

1146
01:50:05,380 --> 01:50:07,380
Long hair.

1147
01:50:07,380 --> 01:50:09,380
It's a cat day.

1148
01:50:09,380 --> 01:50:11,380
I think I'll cut it into a new year's fortune.

1149
01:50:11,380 --> 01:50:14,380
I think it's the end of the month.

1150
01:50:17,380 --> 01:50:21,380
It's a little late.

1151
01:50:21,380 --> 01:50:22,380
It's a good time.

1152
01:50:22,380 --> 01:50:26,380
But it's not until the 29th.

1153
01:50:26,380 --> 01:50:31,380
I feel good because there's a wave until the 29th.

1154
01:50:31,380 --> 01:50:38,380
I'm thinking of not being late.

1155
01:50:39,380 --> 01:50:41,380
Let's do it again.

1156
01:50:41,380 --> 01:50:44,380
I'll do it live this time.

1157
01:50:44,380 --> 01:50:47,380
Let's shave my head this time.

1158
01:50:47,380 --> 01:50:49,380
I'll show you.

1159
01:50:55,380 --> 01:50:58,380
I'll shave it.

1160
01:51:04,380 --> 01:51:05,380
There's a Valentine's Day.

1161
01:51:05,380 --> 01:51:06,380
It's true.

1162
01:51:06,380 --> 01:51:08,380
There's a Valentine's Day on February 14th.

1163
01:51:08,380 --> 01:51:10,380
What?

1164
01:51:10,380 --> 01:51:12,380
I can eat as much as I want.

1165
01:51:12,380 --> 01:51:14,380
It's Valentine's Day.

1166
01:51:14,380 --> 01:51:20,380
I don't know what the Valentine's costume is.

1167
01:51:26,380 --> 01:51:28,380
Chocolate pastry.

1168
01:51:28,380 --> 01:51:33,380
Last year, I did it at the Nico Nico store.

1169
01:51:33,380 --> 01:51:35,380
It's a mess.

1170
01:51:35,380 --> 01:51:37,380
I've done it before.

1171
01:51:37,380 --> 01:51:43,380
I've done it before.

1172
01:51:43,380 --> 01:51:45,380
Valentine's Day?

1173
01:51:45,380 --> 01:51:47,380
When I was in high school,

1174
01:51:47,380 --> 01:51:53,380
There was a culture of exchanging handmade chocolates with high school girls.

1175
01:51:53,380 --> 01:51:56,380
So I always made it.

1176
01:51:56,380 --> 01:51:57,380
When I was in high school,

1177
01:51:57,380 --> 01:52:00,380
I made chocolate brownies and cookies.

1178
01:52:00,380 --> 01:52:05,380
I took it to school and exchanged it with my friends.

1179
01:52:05,380 --> 01:52:08,380
I did that.

1180
01:52:09,380 --> 01:52:11,380
I don't want to hear it.

1181
01:52:11,380 --> 01:52:14,380
It's too much.

1182
01:52:15,380 --> 01:52:18,380
It's not good.

1183
01:52:20,380 --> 01:52:22,380
It's a choco.

1184
01:52:22,380 --> 01:52:24,380
It's a choco.

1185
01:52:25,380 --> 01:52:27,380
I gave it to Nico.

1186
01:52:27,380 --> 01:52:29,380
I think I gave it to him.

1187
01:52:29,380 --> 01:52:31,380
Chocolate conversation.

1188
01:52:31,380 --> 01:52:33,380
And...

1189
01:52:33,380 --> 01:52:40,380
I put it in the archive of the first Nico Nico channel.

1190
01:52:40,380 --> 01:52:42,380
Was it YouTube?

1191
01:52:42,380 --> 01:52:44,380
Unchoco.

1192
01:52:44,380 --> 01:52:46,380
Unchoco?

1193
01:52:46,380 --> 01:52:48,380
It's a Nico Nico channel.

1194
01:52:48,380 --> 01:52:56,380
I think I uploaded the chocolate I made in 2019.

1195
01:52:56,380 --> 01:53:00,380
I mixed marshmallows, chocolate and biscuits.

1196
01:53:00,380 --> 01:53:04,380
It's like a crispy kit-cut.

1197
01:53:04,380 --> 01:53:06,380
How should I say it?

1198
01:53:06,380 --> 01:53:08,380
I heard it was delicious.

1199
01:53:08,380 --> 01:53:13,380
I made it, but it's not digested.

1200
01:53:14,380 --> 01:53:17,380
I want to see something that's not digested.

1201
01:53:17,380 --> 01:53:20,380
No, really.

1202
01:53:21,380 --> 01:53:23,380
I'm really going to watch it later.

1203
01:53:23,380 --> 01:53:28,380
You can watch the archive for 500 yen on the Nico Nico channel.

1204
01:53:28,380 --> 01:53:30,380
It's really a good deal.

1205
01:53:30,380 --> 01:53:35,380
If you're in a fan club,

1206
01:53:36,380 --> 01:53:38,380
5000 yen is...

1207
01:53:38,380 --> 01:53:40,380
5000 yen is...

1208
01:53:40,380 --> 01:53:42,380
You're watching me, right?

1209
01:53:42,380 --> 01:53:45,380
So, 500 yen plus.

1210
01:53:45,380 --> 01:53:49,380
I'm glad you're in the Nico Nico channel.

1211
01:53:49,380 --> 01:53:51,380
You can watch a lot of things.

1212
01:53:51,380 --> 01:53:53,380
I'm streaming four times a month.

1213
01:53:53,380 --> 01:53:55,380
It's a good deal.

1214
01:53:56,380 --> 01:53:58,380
Yeah.

1215
01:54:01,380 --> 01:54:03,380
I'm talking about the fan club.

1216
01:54:03,380 --> 01:54:05,380
I'm talking about the future fan club.

1217
01:54:05,380 --> 01:54:08,380
I'm really unstable.

1218
01:54:08,380 --> 01:54:10,380
I'm a genius.

1219
01:54:10,380 --> 01:54:14,380
Everyone hates me.

1220
01:54:14,380 --> 01:54:16,380
I hate myself.

1221
01:54:16,380 --> 01:54:19,380
I'm a social incompatible person.

1222
01:54:19,380 --> 01:54:21,380
I can't work.

1223
01:54:21,380 --> 01:54:25,380
I'm a mentally unstable woman.

1224
01:54:28,380 --> 01:54:31,380
I'm not going to start a fan club.

1225
01:54:31,380 --> 01:54:33,380
At first,

1226
01:54:36,380 --> 01:54:39,380
I was thinking of making it 10,000 yen.

1227
01:54:39,380 --> 01:54:42,380
If I'm going to complain,

1228
01:54:42,380 --> 01:54:44,380
I'll make it 10,000 yen.

1229
01:54:44,380 --> 01:54:48,380
I don't have to do it for 5000 yen.

1230
01:54:48,380 --> 01:54:53,380
I'm not serious.

1231
01:54:53,380 --> 01:54:55,380
I didn't make this plan.

1232
01:54:55,380 --> 01:54:58,380
I made the 5000 yen plan.

1233
01:54:58,380 --> 01:55:01,380
I want a lot of people to see it.

1234
01:55:01,380 --> 01:55:07,380
I want as many people as possible to see my sexy side.

1235
01:55:07,380 --> 01:55:11,380
But if you show me your beauty for free,

1236
01:55:11,380 --> 01:55:15,380
It lowers your value.

1237
01:55:15,380 --> 01:55:21,380
I want as many people as possible to see it.

1238
01:55:21,380 --> 01:55:24,380
I want as many people as possible to see it.

1239
01:55:24,380 --> 01:55:26,380
I set it up.

1240
01:55:26,380 --> 01:55:30,380
I can't forget it.

1241
01:55:30,380 --> 01:55:33,380
If I make it 10,000 yen, it's twice as much.

1242
01:55:33,380 --> 01:55:35,380
I can't see it.

1243
01:55:35,380 --> 01:55:39,380
I can't upload a short video.

1244
01:55:39,380 --> 01:55:45,380
I'll upload a short video when I'm feeling better.

1245
01:55:45,380 --> 01:55:48,380
Please wait a moment.

1246
01:55:50,380 --> 01:55:54,380
I'm really not good at it.

1247
01:55:54,380 --> 01:55:57,380
When I'm mentally unstable,

1248
01:55:57,380 --> 01:56:01,380
Even if I have a narrow view,

1249
01:56:01,380 --> 01:56:06,380
I can only see the negative opinions.

1250
01:56:07,380 --> 01:56:10,380
I'm sorry.

1251
01:56:12,380 --> 01:56:19,380
I'm trying to calm down.

1252
01:56:19,380 --> 01:56:28,380
I've been receiving the first year's bonus points.

1253
01:56:28,380 --> 01:56:34,380
The first one was from the beginning of last month.

1254
01:56:34,380 --> 01:56:41,380
I think it will start to arrive in February.

1255
01:56:41,380 --> 01:56:43,380
Please wait a moment.

1256
01:56:43,380 --> 01:56:48,380
I want to show you the video.

1257
01:56:48,380 --> 01:56:50,380
I'm showing you my belly.

1258
01:56:50,380 --> 01:56:54,380
I've been filming for a year.

1259
01:56:54,380 --> 01:56:59,380
I'm not in a soundproof room.

1260
01:56:59,380 --> 01:57:01,380
I'm in a bad shape.

1261
01:57:01,380 --> 01:57:04,380
I'm filming with a stomach that can be seen.

1262
01:57:04,380 --> 01:57:06,380
I want to show you.

1263
01:57:06,380 --> 01:57:11,380
The manager is taking care of me.

1264
01:57:11,380 --> 01:57:14,380
It's taking a while.

1265
01:57:14,380 --> 01:57:16,380
Please wait a moment.

1266
01:57:18,380 --> 01:57:22,380
I'll make my neck longer and become a giraffe.

1267
01:57:22,380 --> 01:57:24,380
Make it longer.

1268
01:57:24,380 --> 01:57:26,380
Drink water.

1269
01:57:30,380 --> 01:57:32,380
I'm looking forward to it.

1270
01:57:32,380 --> 01:57:34,380
I'm looking forward to it.

1271
01:57:34,380 --> 01:57:35,380
Is it the lotus flower?

1272
01:57:35,380 --> 01:57:39,380
The lotus flower plan has been going on for a year.

1273
01:57:39,380 --> 01:57:44,380
I think the person who planned it yesterday had a check.

1274
01:57:44,380 --> 01:57:48,380
Check and check holder.

1275
01:57:48,380 --> 01:57:50,380
I don't have a video.

1276
01:57:50,380 --> 01:57:52,380
How was it?

1277
01:57:52,380 --> 01:57:54,380
I'm a genius.

1278
01:57:54,380 --> 01:57:57,380
I'm a genius.

1279
01:57:57,380 --> 01:58:01,380
I've been removing bad things.

1280
01:58:01,380 --> 01:58:04,380
I'm doing legal procedures.

1281
01:58:04,380 --> 01:58:06,380
I'm tired of it.

1282
01:58:09,380 --> 01:58:11,380
I think it's hard.

1283
01:58:11,380 --> 01:58:15,380
The one of the Kaizu era.

1284
01:58:15,380 --> 01:58:17,380
The one of the nipples.

1285
01:58:17,380 --> 01:58:21,380
The one of the nipples festival in autumn 2022.

1286
01:58:21,380 --> 01:58:25,380
I'm finally settled.

1287
01:58:25,380 --> 01:58:28,380
I've finally been able to identify it.

1288
01:58:28,380 --> 01:58:30,380
I can't do it now.

1289
01:58:30,380 --> 01:58:36,380
I've been receiving a lot of things from my partner.

1290
01:58:36,380 --> 01:58:38,380
I'm sorry.

1291
01:58:38,380 --> 01:58:41,380
I can't afford this amount.

1292
01:58:41,380 --> 01:58:46,380
I'll pay you every month.

1293
01:58:46,380 --> 01:58:48,380
I've been wearing it.

1294
01:58:48,380 --> 01:58:51,380
I think so.

1295
01:58:51,380 --> 01:58:53,380
I think everyone is the same.

1296
01:58:53,380 --> 01:58:56,380
I don't think there's anyone.

1297
01:58:56,380 --> 01:58:58,380
I don't think there's anyone.

1298
01:58:58,380 --> 01:59:01,380
Everyone, don't do anything bad.

1299
01:59:01,380 --> 01:59:07,380
If you do something bad, everyone will be unhappy.

1300
01:59:07,380 --> 01:59:11,380
It's hard for the person who did something bad.

1301
01:59:11,380 --> 01:59:15,380
It's a little hard for the person who did something bad.

1302
01:59:15,380 --> 01:59:17,380
It's hard.

1303
01:59:17,380 --> 01:59:19,380
It's really hard.

1304
01:59:19,380 --> 01:59:21,380
That's right.

1305
01:59:21,380 --> 01:59:28,380
But I'll keep protecting the content that's important to everyone.

1306
01:59:28,380 --> 01:59:30,380
From now on.

1307
01:59:30,380 --> 01:59:32,380
I'll protect it.

1308
01:59:34,380 --> 01:59:36,380
I'll do my best.

1309
01:59:40,380 --> 01:59:43,380
I don't want to be punished.

1310
01:59:43,380 --> 01:59:46,380
I'm proud of you.

1311
01:59:46,380 --> 01:59:48,380
Thank you for thinking that way.

1312
01:59:48,380 --> 01:59:50,380
You're a good person.

1313
01:59:50,380 --> 01:59:52,380
You're a good person.

1314
01:59:52,380 --> 01:59:57,380
There are many underaged people.

1315
01:59:57,380 --> 02:00:00,380
It's not just one or two.

1316
02:00:00,380 --> 02:00:02,380
My parents and my father said,

1317
02:00:02,380 --> 02:00:04,380
I'm sorry.

1318
02:00:04,380 --> 02:00:08,380
My child.

1319
02:00:08,380 --> 02:00:10,380
That's right.

1320
02:00:10,380 --> 02:00:12,380
My heart hurts.

1321
02:00:12,380 --> 02:00:24,340
A demon that distorts the young's

1322
02:00:24,340 --> 02:00:27,380
You can't see the young's picture.

1323
02:00:27,380 --> 02:00:29,380
You can't.

1324
02:00:29,380 --> 02:00:31,380
Because I'm a pervert.

1325
02:00:31,380 --> 02:00:33,380
Because I'm a pervert.

1326
02:00:37,380 --> 02:00:40,380
This is on the Internet.

1327
02:00:40,380 --> 02:00:42,380
This is on the Internet.

1328
02:00:42,380 --> 02:00:44,380
The information I have now is.

1329
02:00:44,380 --> 02:00:46,380
That person is a Yahoo!

1330
02:00:46,380 --> 02:00:48,380
I'm talking to a Yahoo!

1331
02:00:48,380 --> 02:00:50,380
I'm talking to a Yahoo!

1332
02:00:50,380 --> 02:00:52,380
I said it because I'm a pervert.

1333
02:00:52,380 --> 02:00:54,380
I don't say anything else.

1334
02:00:54,380 --> 02:00:56,380
Yes.

1335
02:00:56,380 --> 02:00:58,380
Yes.

1336
02:00:58,380 --> 02:01:00,380
Of course.

1337
02:01:00,380 --> 02:01:02,380
Which prefecture are you from?

1338
02:01:02,380 --> 02:01:04,380
How old are you?

1339
02:01:04,380 --> 02:01:06,380
I don't need personal information.

1340
02:01:06,380 --> 02:01:10,380
I got a document from Kanan when I was a minor.

1341
02:01:10,380 --> 02:01:12,380
What should I do?

1342
02:01:12,380 --> 02:01:21,380
I was surprised when I heard that from the listener.

1343
02:01:29,380 --> 02:01:31,380
That's right.

1344
02:01:36,380 --> 02:01:38,380
That's right.

1345
02:01:38,380 --> 02:01:40,380
That's right.

1346
02:01:40,380 --> 02:01:42,380
That's right.

1347
02:01:42,380 --> 02:01:44,380
Well.

1348
02:01:44,380 --> 02:01:46,380
I thought it was about my age.

1349
02:01:46,380 --> 02:01:48,380
I wrote it down.

1350
02:01:48,380 --> 02:01:51,380
I don't think it's my age.

1351
02:01:51,380 --> 02:01:53,380
I thought it was my age.

1352
02:01:53,380 --> 02:01:55,380
I really can't do it.

1353
02:01:55,380 --> 02:01:57,380
It's natural, but.

1354
02:01:57,380 --> 02:01:59,380
Especially to me.

1355
02:01:59,380 --> 02:02:01,380
Kanan.

1356
02:02:01,380 --> 02:02:03,380
I can't write that I got this document.

1357
02:02:03,380 --> 02:02:16,380
I said that I would forgive you, but don't write it in the future.

1358
02:02:17,380 --> 02:02:19,380
Don't write it in the future.

1359
02:02:20,380 --> 02:02:22,380
I said that.

1360
02:02:26,380 --> 02:02:28,380
I'm done talking about that.

1361
02:02:28,380 --> 02:02:30,380
I'm done talking about that.

1362
02:02:34,380 --> 02:02:38,380
I think the fan club will continue to be the same.

1363
02:02:39,380 --> 02:02:51,380
When I'm not on live, I take a video and I do a little risk.

1364
02:02:52,380 --> 02:02:56,380
I don't think it's a basic thing.

1365
02:02:57,380 --> 02:03:00,380
I'd like to do that, so please take care of me.

1366
02:03:04,380 --> 02:03:15,380
I was watching the live stream and I thought I wanted to make my boobs really sticky.

1367
02:03:16,380 --> 02:03:21,380
I thought I could make my boobs sticky next time.

1368
02:03:22,380 --> 02:03:25,380
I thought I couldn't forget it.

1369
02:03:26,380 --> 02:03:32,380
My boobs are sticky.

1370
02:03:36,380 --> 02:03:45,380
This is still unknown, but if I do live streaming for 2 hours and a half, I'll do it.

1371
02:03:46,380 --> 02:03:50,380
I'm doing live streaming including angle changes.

1372
02:03:51,380 --> 02:03:59,380
If I need a break for 2 hours and a half, I'll record a part of it.

1373
02:04:00,380 --> 02:04:04,380
I'll record the last angle like today.

1374
02:04:05,380 --> 02:04:09,380
I'll record the angle that's hard to do on live.

1375
02:04:10,380 --> 02:04:16,380
I'll record a part of it and record the angle.

1376
02:04:17,380 --> 02:04:27,380
If it's better for me to do it, I'll try it.

1377
02:04:32,380 --> 02:04:35,380
I'd like to try a lot of things.

1378
02:04:36,380 --> 02:04:38,380
By the way, I was drinking black tea.

1379
02:04:39,380 --> 02:04:44,380
I was watching your comments and drinking black tea.

1380
02:04:47,380 --> 02:04:52,380
I bought a good black tea, so I put it in and drank it.

1381
02:04:53,380 --> 02:05:00,380
I was watching you for an hour and a half.

1382
02:05:00,380 --> 02:05:03,380
I was watching your comments.

1383
02:05:05,380 --> 02:05:08,380
It's fashionable, isn't it?

1384
02:05:09,380 --> 02:05:16,380
I was drinking white tea.

1385
02:05:17,380 --> 02:05:22,380
I don't know the difference between white tea and black tea, but I drank white tea.

1386
02:05:22,380 --> 02:05:24,380
I was watching your comments.

1387
02:05:25,380 --> 02:05:27,380
I was watching your comments.

1388
02:05:28,380 --> 02:05:33,380
I was watching your comments.

1389
02:05:34,380 --> 02:05:37,380
I was doing it elegantly.

1390
02:05:37,380 --> 02:05:39,380
I was watching your comments.

1391
02:05:44,380 --> 02:05:46,380
In a sense, it's hell.

1392
02:05:47,380 --> 02:05:49,380
It's not hell.

1393
02:05:50,380 --> 02:05:56,380
I like to see everyone looking at me.

1394
02:05:57,380 --> 02:06:00,380
I think it's a natural tendency.

1395
02:06:01,380 --> 02:06:03,380
I'm a natural.

1396
02:06:03,380 --> 02:06:14,380
I'm happy that I'm feeling good about myself.

1397
02:06:16,380 --> 02:06:18,380
I'm happy.

1398
02:06:21,380 --> 02:06:22,380
I'm happy.

1399
02:06:23,380 --> 02:06:31,380
I really like the fan club and the fan club.

1400
02:06:33,380 --> 02:06:43,380
I thought it would be better to stop the fan club and the fan club.

1401
02:06:44,380 --> 02:06:53,380
I'm not a professional because I'm not satisfied with my physical condition.

1402
02:06:54,380 --> 02:06:56,380
I'm not a professional.

1403
02:06:56,380 --> 02:06:58,380
You can see it, right?

1404
02:06:59,380 --> 02:07:06,380
I've never been surprised by the way you make fun of me.

1405
02:07:07,380 --> 02:07:10,380
I'm not good at it, but I'm not a professional.

1406
02:07:11,380 --> 02:07:13,380
I'm too confident in myself.

1407
02:07:14,380 --> 02:07:15,380
So I quit.

1408
02:07:20,380 --> 02:07:23,380
How many parts are there now?

1409
02:07:23,380 --> 02:07:25,380
I'll show you the picture.

1410
02:07:26,380 --> 02:07:28,380
I'll overwrite this picture.

1411
02:07:29,380 --> 02:07:31,380
It's part 19.

1412
02:07:32,380 --> 02:07:35,380
I'm still in a bad mood even if it's part 19.

1413
02:07:37,380 --> 02:07:39,380
It's a little painful.

1414
02:07:40,380 --> 02:07:42,380
I can't move well.

1415
02:07:43,380 --> 02:07:47,380
I had a cramping ceremony.

1416
02:07:48,380 --> 02:07:51,380
I thought it was painful.

1417
02:07:51,380 --> 02:07:52,380
I thought it might hurt.

1418
02:07:53,380 --> 02:07:59,380
But when I said I was tired, I thought I was going to cool down.

1419
02:08:01,380 --> 02:08:06,380
I don't know if I'm a high school girl.

1420
02:08:07,380 --> 02:08:13,380
I don't know why I'm the first time I've ever dated my boyfriend.

1421
02:08:14,380 --> 02:08:18,380
I don't want to be hated, so I have to put up with it.

1422
02:08:18,380 --> 02:08:20,380
I don't want to be hated.

1423
02:08:26,380 --> 02:08:28,380
I made a comment without thinking.

1424
02:08:29,380 --> 02:08:31,380
I feel like I'm back.

1425
02:08:32,380 --> 02:08:36,380
I thought the video was back in the fan club.

1426
02:08:37,380 --> 02:08:38,380
I thought it was amazing.

1427
02:08:39,380 --> 02:08:43,380
I thought I was going to take a break.

1428
02:08:44,380 --> 02:08:46,380
I cut it once.

1429
02:08:47,380 --> 02:08:52,380
I thought I'd take a break for about 10 minutes.

1430
02:08:53,380 --> 02:09:01,380
I cut it once and edited it.

1431
02:09:02,380 --> 02:09:06,380
I'm free for 10 minutes, so I can't edit it well.

1432
02:09:06,380 --> 02:09:07,380
I can't edit it well.

1433
02:09:13,380 --> 02:09:17,380
I think that's just for the video.

1434
02:09:19,380 --> 02:09:21,380
I didn't edit it.

1435
02:09:22,380 --> 02:09:23,380
I edited it.

1436
02:09:27,380 --> 02:09:32,380
I edited it so much that it was a little bit of a mess.

1437
02:09:36,380 --> 02:09:38,380
I think it's a little bit of a mess.

1438
02:09:44,380 --> 02:09:49,380
But I think there's a lot of flexibility.

1439
02:09:50,380 --> 02:09:54,380
A woman's body is a little bit of a romance.

1440
02:09:55,380 --> 02:09:58,380
Two fingers are fine.

1441
02:09:59,380 --> 02:10:06,380
If it's really wet, I think it's important to make a sound.

1442
02:10:07,380 --> 02:10:13,380
Suddenly, I suddenly felt like I was going to go.

1443
02:10:14,380 --> 02:10:17,380
I stopped it for a moment because it hurt.

1444
02:10:19,380 --> 02:10:21,380
I should have done it slowly.

1445
02:10:21,380 --> 02:10:22,380
I'm going to do it.

1446
02:10:26,380 --> 02:10:27,380
I'm going to do it.

1447
02:10:34,380 --> 02:10:35,380
But it wasn't fun.

1448
02:10:37,380 --> 02:10:38,380
I'll do it again.

1449
02:10:39,380 --> 02:10:42,380
I'll do it again in the future.

1450
02:10:43,380 --> 02:10:45,380
I wanted to do it with Miko.

1451
02:10:51,380 --> 02:10:55,380
I'm looking forward to what kind of video I'll make next.

1452
02:10:56,380 --> 02:10:57,380
What kind of video will I make next?

1453
02:10:58,380 --> 02:10:59,380
What should I do?

1454
02:11:00,380 --> 02:11:05,380
I've been thinking about doing a video like Calvin Klein for a long time.

1455
02:11:06,380 --> 02:11:10,380
I'm thinking about doing a house-style video.

1456
02:11:11,380 --> 02:11:12,380
I'm still doing cosplay.

1457
02:11:13,380 --> 02:11:15,380
I'm still doing cosplay.

1458
02:11:16,380 --> 02:11:17,380
I'm not doing cosplay.

1459
02:11:18,380 --> 02:11:19,380
I'm doing a video like Calvin Klein.

1460
02:11:20,380 --> 02:11:27,380
I'm thinking about doing a video like a video call.

1461
02:11:28,380 --> 02:11:31,380
I'm thinking about various things.

1462
02:11:35,380 --> 02:11:36,380
I'm thinking about various things.

1463
02:11:37,380 --> 02:11:39,380
That video was also popular.

1464
02:11:41,380 --> 02:11:46,380
I've been talking about it for a long time.

1465
02:11:46,380 --> 02:11:47,380
I'm thinking about it.

1466
02:11:48,380 --> 02:11:51,380
I was shooting a video today.

1467
02:11:52,380 --> 02:11:54,380
I was shooting a video.

1468
02:11:55,380 --> 02:11:58,380
The camera angle was small.

1469
02:11:59,380 --> 02:12:01,380
I can't talk for a long time.

1470
02:12:02,380 --> 02:12:04,380
I'm thinking about doing a video like a video call.

1471
02:12:06,380 --> 02:12:08,380
I'm thinking about doing a video like a video call.

1472
02:12:08,380 --> 02:12:09,380
I'm thinking about doing a video like a video call.

1473
02:12:15,380 --> 02:12:19,380
I want to do various things.

1474
02:12:20,380 --> 02:12:26,380
But I really don't want to be negative.

1475
02:12:27,380 --> 02:12:30,380
Do you all like me?

1476
02:12:31,380 --> 02:12:34,380
I'm thinking about it.

1477
02:12:35,380 --> 02:12:37,380
Do you all like me?

1478
02:12:38,380 --> 02:12:40,380
I like everyone.

1479
02:12:41,380 --> 02:12:51,380
I really want to cherish that feeling.

1480
02:12:51,380 --> 02:12:52,380
I want to do it.

1481
02:12:58,380 --> 02:13:03,380
I'm thinking about the price of the video.

1482
02:13:04,380 --> 02:13:06,380
I'm thinking about the price of the video.

1483
02:13:07,380 --> 02:13:08,380
I'm thinking about the price of the video.

1484
02:13:09,380 --> 02:13:11,380
I'm thinking about the price of the video.

1485
02:13:12,380 --> 02:13:14,380
I'm thinking about the price of the video.

1486
02:13:15,380 --> 02:13:17,380
I'm thinking about the price of the video.

1487
02:13:17,380 --> 02:13:20,380
It seemed that the pressure was increasing.

1488
02:13:21,380 --> 02:13:24,380
Of course, the best feeling is always good.

1489
02:13:25,380 --> 02:13:26,380
I'll be happy, though.

1490
02:13:27,380 --> 02:13:31,380
The feeling mental pressure has become a burden for me.

1491
02:13:34,380 --> 02:13:37,380
From such a pure video, I watched the video with bare eyes.

1492
02:14:07,380 --> 02:14:17,380
But until then, I think I can make you feel good.

1493
02:14:19,380 --> 02:14:21,380
I can enjoy my first love.

1494
02:14:21,380 --> 02:14:23,380
I'm going to jump in.

1495
02:14:23,380 --> 02:14:29,380
I want to hear your voice, I want to support you, so I'm in a fan club.

1496
02:14:38,380 --> 02:14:40,380
I'm sorry.

1497
02:14:52,380 --> 02:14:54,380
Thank you.

1498
02:14:58,380 --> 02:15:01,380
I'm not laughing.

1499
02:15:02,380 --> 02:15:04,380
Thank you.

1500
02:15:05,380 --> 02:15:07,380
I'm happy.

1501
02:15:08,380 --> 02:15:10,380
Thank you.

1502
02:15:12,380 --> 02:15:14,380
Thank you.

1503
02:15:14,380 --> 02:15:16,380
I'm going to do my best.

1504
02:15:16,380 --> 02:15:18,380
Thank you.

1505
02:15:33,380 --> 02:15:35,380
Thank you.

1506
02:15:43,380 --> 02:15:45,380
I'm going to do my best.

1507
02:15:47,380 --> 02:15:49,380
I'm calm.

1508
02:15:52,380 --> 02:15:54,380
Thank you very much.

1509
02:16:02,380 --> 02:16:04,380
I'm not good at myself.

1510
02:16:04,380 --> 02:16:08,380
I'm thinking about 0 or 100.

1511
02:16:09,380 --> 02:16:15,380
I'm going to stop thinking about anything.

1512
02:16:16,380 --> 02:16:19,380
I'm worried about everyone.

1513
02:16:23,380 --> 02:16:25,380
I'm drinking tea.

1514
02:16:25,380 --> 02:16:27,380
I'll do it again next time.

1515
02:16:27,380 --> 02:16:32,380
I'm going to do a tea time.

1516
02:16:35,380 --> 02:16:37,380
Thank you.

1517
02:16:41,380 --> 02:16:45,380
I'm going to throw away everything I don't need.

1518
02:16:46,380 --> 02:16:51,380
I'm going to talk about something good at the end.

1519
02:16:51,380 --> 02:16:53,380
I'm going to talk about something good.

1520
02:16:53,380 --> 02:16:56,380
Everyone will make me cry.

1521
02:16:57,380 --> 02:17:01,380
Everyone will be moved by me and make me cry.

1522
02:17:01,380 --> 02:17:03,380
I'm calm.

1523
02:17:03,380 --> 02:17:05,380
I'm going to talk about something sexy.

1524
02:17:06,380 --> 02:17:09,380
I bought something new.

1525
02:17:09,380 --> 02:17:13,380
I bought something new.

1526
02:17:13,380 --> 02:17:15,380
Wait a minute.

1527
02:17:15,380 --> 02:17:17,380
What was it?

1528
02:17:17,380 --> 02:17:19,380
I bought it on Amazon.

1529
02:17:19,380 --> 02:17:21,380
I want to try it next time.

1530
02:17:23,380 --> 02:17:25,380
My voice is a mess.

1531
02:17:27,380 --> 02:17:29,380
What was it?

1532
02:17:30,380 --> 02:17:32,380
Amazon.

1533
02:17:33,380 --> 02:17:35,380
I think I bought something.

1534
02:17:41,380 --> 02:17:43,380
Did you get it?

1535
02:17:45,380 --> 02:17:51,380
I think this is really good.

1536
02:17:51,380 --> 02:17:57,380
It's a one-point concentration of a woman who bullies her.

1537
02:17:57,380 --> 02:18:01,380
It's called a one-point concentration.

1538
02:18:01,380 --> 02:18:04,380
It says it's a salt-blowing vibe.

1539
02:18:04,380 --> 02:18:07,380
I've never blown salt.

1540
02:18:08,380 --> 02:18:13,380
I've seen a lot of women blowing salt in AVs.

1541
02:18:13,380 --> 02:18:16,380
I've never blown salt.

1542
02:18:18,380 --> 02:18:21,380
I want to try it.

1543
02:18:22,380 --> 02:18:24,380
I want to try it.

1544
02:18:24,380 --> 02:18:34,380
I looked it up and it said it's easy to blow salt if you drink a lot of water and bully the clitoris.

1545
02:18:34,380 --> 02:18:36,380
I want to wear this.

1546
02:18:36,380 --> 02:18:38,380
What's this?

1547
02:18:38,380 --> 02:18:40,380
I believe in it.

1548
02:18:43,380 --> 02:18:45,380
What's a C-spot?

1549
02:18:46,380 --> 02:18:49,380
It says C-spot stimulation, but it's not a G.

1550
02:18:49,380 --> 02:18:51,380
There's a C-spot.

1551
02:18:57,380 --> 02:18:59,380
If you blow salt, you'll be banned.

1552
02:19:00,380 --> 02:19:02,380
If you blow salt, you'll be banned?

1553
02:19:02,380 --> 02:19:04,380
I think it's a pee.

1554
02:19:04,380 --> 02:19:09,380
If you blow salt, you'll be banned.

1555
02:19:09,380 --> 02:19:11,380
Is it bad?

1556
02:19:13,380 --> 02:19:17,380
If it's salt, it's bad.

1557
02:19:17,380 --> 02:19:20,380
Is it a salt-blowing thing?

1558
02:19:20,380 --> 02:19:22,380
On the contrary, I don't blow salt.

1559
02:19:22,380 --> 02:19:25,380
Is it a good thing?

1560
02:19:25,380 --> 02:19:27,380
Is it a ban?

1561
02:19:29,380 --> 02:19:31,380
Is this a short video?

1562
02:19:31,380 --> 02:19:33,380
Is that so?

1563
02:19:33,380 --> 02:19:35,380
That's probably true.

1564
02:19:35,380 --> 02:19:41,380
I don't think it's a good thing to pee.

1565
02:19:41,380 --> 02:19:47,380
I don't think it's a good thing to pee.

1566
02:19:50,380 --> 02:19:52,380
I'm glad.

1567
02:19:52,380 --> 02:19:54,380
Is it saved by its weight?

1568
02:19:57,380 --> 02:19:59,380
If it's just sound.

1569
02:19:59,380 --> 02:20:04,380
Sound is like a fart.

1570
02:20:04,380 --> 02:20:06,380
I don't know if I've ever blown salt.

1571
02:20:06,380 --> 02:20:10,380
I'm probably a bad person.

1572
02:20:12,380 --> 02:20:16,380
I can't make a sound.

1573
02:20:16,380 --> 02:20:18,380
I think I'll do it.

1574
02:20:18,380 --> 02:20:21,380
I think I'll do it.

1575
02:20:24,380 --> 02:20:26,380
I think I'll do it.

1576
02:20:26,380 --> 02:20:29,380
I'm too excited.

1577
02:20:31,380 --> 02:20:34,380
I'll finish in 30 minutes.

1578
02:20:35,380 --> 02:20:37,380
I'm always early.

1579
02:20:37,380 --> 02:20:39,380
I'm tired.

1580
02:20:39,380 --> 02:20:41,380
I'm tired.

1581
02:20:41,380 --> 02:20:43,380
I'm tired.

1582
02:20:43,380 --> 02:20:45,380
I'm tired.

1583
02:20:45,380 --> 02:20:47,380
I'm tired.

1584
02:20:49,380 --> 02:20:51,380
I'm tired.

1585
02:20:52,380 --> 02:20:54,380
I'm tired.

1586
02:20:55,380 --> 02:20:57,380
I'm not in a bad mood.

1587
02:20:57,380 --> 02:21:00,380
I've been on a diet lately.

1588
02:21:00,380 --> 02:21:02,380
I've been on a diet lately.

1589
02:21:04,380 --> 02:21:05,380
I don't know why.

1590
02:21:05,380 --> 02:21:07,380
I'm on a diet.

1591
02:21:08,380 --> 02:21:10,380
But I'm doing that.

1592
02:21:12,380 --> 02:21:14,380
When I'm peeing.

1593
02:21:14,380 --> 02:21:19,380
I heard that it's good to stop peeing.

1594
02:21:20,380 --> 02:21:25,380
I'm going to do a map training in the future.

1595
02:21:27,380 --> 02:21:29,380
I don't have any reason to do it now.

1596
02:21:29,380 --> 02:21:34,380
I don't think I can use this for fan-cut.

1597
02:21:34,380 --> 02:21:36,380
I'm going to do it.

1598
02:21:36,380 --> 02:21:38,380
I'm going to do it.

1599
02:21:38,380 --> 02:21:40,380
I'm going to do it.

1600
02:21:40,380 --> 02:21:42,380
I'm going to do it.

1601
02:21:42,380 --> 02:21:44,380
I'm going to do a map training.

1602
02:21:44,380 --> 02:21:50,380
I heard that it's good to stop peeing.

1603
02:21:52,380 --> 02:21:55,380
It says it's good for the joints.

1604
02:21:55,380 --> 02:21:58,380
I'm not in a good mood.

1605
02:22:00,380 --> 02:22:02,380
I'm not in a good mood when I'm peeing.

1606
02:22:02,380 --> 02:22:05,380
I'm going to do a map training.

1607
02:22:06,380 --> 02:22:10,380
There's a ball in the map.

1608
02:22:10,380 --> 02:22:13,380
I don't think I can use that.

1609
02:22:13,380 --> 02:22:16,380
I thought it was going to hurt.

1610
02:22:16,380 --> 02:22:21,380
I'm going to do it.

1611
02:22:21,380 --> 02:22:23,380
How do you get that information?

1612
02:22:23,380 --> 02:22:25,380
It's the Internet.

1613
02:22:26,380 --> 02:22:28,380
It's on the Internet.

1614
02:22:28,380 --> 02:22:32,380
It's on Twitter.

1615
02:22:32,380 --> 02:22:42,380
It's the Internet that makes me feel good when I do it.

1616
02:22:43,380 --> 02:22:45,380
And...

1617
02:22:46,380 --> 02:22:50,380
I saw a column about pee.

1618
02:22:50,380 --> 02:22:56,380
A girl's column.

1619
02:22:56,380 --> 02:22:58,380
What was it?

1620
02:22:58,380 --> 02:23:00,380
There's a column.

1621
02:23:01,380 --> 02:23:07,380
I used to use a lotion that I could lick.

1622
02:23:07,380 --> 02:23:11,380
There was a column on the website where I bought the lotion.

1623
02:23:12,380 --> 02:23:14,380
I think.

1624
02:23:14,380 --> 02:23:16,380
There is.

1625
02:23:16,380 --> 02:23:18,380
There's something like that.

1626
02:23:18,380 --> 02:23:23,380
I've never bought anything else.

1627
02:23:24,380 --> 02:23:28,380
It's like a perfume that invites lipid.

1628
02:23:29,380 --> 02:23:32,380
It's so stupid to sell it.

1629
02:23:32,380 --> 02:23:35,380
When I go out, everyone says,

1630
02:23:35,380 --> 02:23:37,380
I think I'm going to be attacked.

1631
02:23:37,380 --> 02:23:39,380
Inviting lipid.

1632
02:23:39,380 --> 02:23:41,380
There is.

1633
02:23:41,380 --> 02:23:45,380
There's a lot of liquid in the perfume.

1634
02:23:46,380 --> 02:23:47,380
It's in the perfume.

1635
02:23:47,380 --> 02:23:53,380
It's a perfume for a boyfriend.

1636
02:23:53,380 --> 02:23:55,380
I'm not a boyfriend.

1637
02:23:55,380 --> 02:23:58,380
I'm a pervert.

1638
02:23:59,380 --> 02:24:04,380
It's a world of porn and eroticism.

1639
02:24:04,380 --> 02:24:08,380
I'm not a pervert.

1640
02:24:08,380 --> 02:24:10,380
I'm a pervert.

1641
02:24:10,380 --> 02:24:11,380
I have a boyfriend.

1642
02:24:11,380 --> 02:24:15,380
I have a boyfriend who I want him to look at.

1643
02:24:18,380 --> 02:24:19,380
I don't think so.

1644
02:24:19,380 --> 02:24:21,380
I'm going to meet you alone.

1645
02:24:21,380 --> 02:24:25,380
Before I meet you alone, I'm going to take a train or a taxi.

1646
02:24:25,380 --> 02:24:27,380
I'm going to take a taxi.

1647
02:24:29,380 --> 02:24:31,380
I'm going to take a taxi.

1648
02:24:31,380 --> 02:24:33,380
I'm going to get excited.

1649
02:24:33,380 --> 02:24:35,380
I don't think so.

1650
02:24:36,380 --> 02:24:38,380
I'm going to meet you alone.

1651
02:24:38,380 --> 02:24:42,380
When I meet you alone, I'm going to take a taxi.

1652
02:24:42,380 --> 02:24:44,380
I don't know.

1653
02:24:44,380 --> 02:24:49,380
I'm going to a beautiful place where I can see the night view.

1654
02:24:49,380 --> 02:24:54,380
I'm going to a hotel after this.

1655
02:24:54,380 --> 02:24:57,380
I'm going to a restaurant.

1656
02:24:57,380 --> 02:25:09,380
When I get back to the restaurant, the waitress there is also a pervert.

1657
02:25:12,380 --> 02:25:15,380
I'm a pervert except for my boyfriend.

1658
02:25:19,380 --> 02:25:21,380
I'm sorry.

1659
02:25:24,380 --> 02:25:26,380
It's too dangerous.

1660
02:25:27,380 --> 02:25:29,380
It's dangerous.

1661
02:25:29,380 --> 02:25:31,380
Is it okay to do that?

1662
02:25:33,380 --> 02:25:37,380
I have a bad mood.

1663
02:25:37,380 --> 02:25:39,380
I'm under the influence of drugs.

1664
02:25:39,380 --> 02:25:42,380
If I change my perfume, I'll be in trouble.

1665
02:25:42,380 --> 02:25:45,380
I'll change my perfume before the limited broadcast.

1666
02:25:45,380 --> 02:25:47,380
I'll change my perfume.

1667
02:25:47,380 --> 02:25:49,380
I wonder if that's going to happen.

1668
02:25:49,380 --> 02:25:52,380
I hope it works for me.

1669
02:25:55,380 --> 02:26:00,380
I want to spend my precious time with everyone.

1670
02:26:00,380 --> 02:26:02,380
Can I buy it?

1671
02:26:02,380 --> 02:26:04,380
I'll report it to you.

1672
02:26:05,380 --> 02:26:07,380
I'm going to go outside.

1673
02:26:08,380 --> 02:26:15,380
I can't do it because I'm in danger of getting a serious delivery.

1674
02:26:15,380 --> 02:26:18,380
I'm in the house.

1675
02:26:18,380 --> 02:26:22,380
I smell good.

1676
02:26:25,380 --> 02:26:27,380
I'm a delivery man.

1677
02:26:35,380 --> 02:26:37,380
I have a bad mood.

1678
02:26:37,380 --> 02:26:42,380
I'm a delivery man.

1679
02:26:43,380 --> 02:26:45,380
I'm a delivery man.

1680
02:26:48,380 --> 02:26:50,380
I'm influenced by you.

1681
02:26:50,380 --> 02:26:53,380
I'm always in the back of my head.

1682
02:26:55,380 --> 02:27:01,380
Everyone in my house is a male.

1683
02:27:01,380 --> 02:27:03,380
I'm influenced by you.

1684
02:27:03,380 --> 02:27:05,380
I wonder if I'll be a pervert.

1685
02:27:05,380 --> 02:27:07,380
I'm worried.

1686
02:27:07,380 --> 02:27:09,380
If I show up in your house,

1687
02:27:09,380 --> 02:27:11,380
Everyone is a male.

1688
02:27:14,380 --> 02:27:20,380
I don't like touching you with perfume.

1689
02:27:21,380 --> 02:27:24,380
I don't like perfume.

1690
02:27:24,380 --> 02:27:26,380
I don't like perfume.

1691
02:27:26,380 --> 02:27:28,380
I smell bad.

1692
02:27:28,380 --> 02:27:31,380
I'm worried about my weight.

1693
02:27:31,380 --> 02:27:34,380
I'm sure I have foreign blood in my body.

1694
02:27:34,380 --> 02:27:41,380
I was told that my face was small.

1695
02:27:43,380 --> 02:27:46,380
I'm worried about my weight.

1696
02:27:48,380 --> 02:27:51,380
I wash my body with soap.

1697
02:27:51,380 --> 02:27:54,380
I wash it with a double.

1698
02:27:54,380 --> 02:27:56,380
I don't use perfume.

1699
02:27:56,380 --> 02:28:00,380
I'll try perfume.

1700
02:28:00,380 --> 02:28:02,380
30 minutes.

1701
02:28:02,380 --> 02:28:04,380
I'll sleep.

1702
02:28:04,380 --> 02:28:07,380
Thank you for the pillow talk.

1703
02:28:12,380 --> 02:28:15,380
It was a video, so it felt good.

1704
02:28:15,380 --> 02:28:20,380
I cried in the pillow talk.

1705
02:28:20,380 --> 02:28:23,380
I feel refreshed.

1706
02:28:24,380 --> 02:28:27,380
I feel refreshed in many ways.

1707
02:28:27,380 --> 02:28:29,380
Thank you.

1708
02:28:30,380 --> 02:28:32,380
I'll sleep.

1709
02:28:32,380 --> 02:28:34,380
I'll sleep.

1710
02:28:34,380 --> 02:28:42,380
I'm uploading a fan letter.

1711
02:28:42,380 --> 02:28:46,380
I'm uploading a fan letter.

1712
02:28:46,380 --> 02:28:48,380
Thank you in February.

1713
02:28:48,380 --> 02:28:53,380
I'm looking forward to the first broadcast of Niconico in February.

1714
02:28:53,380 --> 02:28:58,380
I have to take medicine for a week.

1715
02:28:58,380 --> 02:29:01,380
I have to take medicine for a week.

1716
02:29:01,380 --> 02:29:04,380
I'm sleepy.

1717
02:29:04,380 --> 02:29:07,380
I'm worried.

1718
02:29:07,380 --> 02:29:09,380
I'll drink a lot of medicine for a week.

1719
02:29:09,380 --> 02:29:12,380
I'll drink a lot of medicine for a week.

1720
02:29:12,380 --> 02:29:14,380
I'll do my best.

1721
02:29:14,380 --> 02:29:19,380
I'll live calmly.

1722
02:29:20,380 --> 02:29:24,380
I'll do ASMR.

1723
02:29:24,380 --> 02:29:29,380
I'll do ASMR.

1724
02:29:32,380 --> 02:29:34,380
Good night.

1725
02:29:34,380 --> 02:29:36,380
Thank you.

1726
02:29:36,380 --> 02:29:38,380
Thank you always.

1727
02:29:40,380 --> 02:29:42,380
I'll do my best.

1728
02:29:42,380 --> 02:29:43,380
I'll do my best.

1729
02:29:43,380 --> 02:29:45,380
All I can do is...

1730
02:29:45,380 --> 02:29:49,380
I have to take care of myself.

1731
02:29:49,380 --> 02:29:51,380
I have to believe in everyone.

1732
02:29:51,380 --> 02:29:52,380
I have to believe in everyone.

1733
02:29:52,380 --> 02:29:56,380
I have to love myself.

1734
02:29:56,380 --> 02:30:02,380
I have to love myself.

1735
02:30:02,380 --> 02:30:04,380
I have to love myself.

1736
02:30:04,380 --> 02:30:07,380
I have to love myself.

1737
02:30:07,380 --> 02:30:14,380
There is a famous song that I forgot.

1738
02:30:16,380 --> 02:30:18,380
I'll live calmly.

1739
02:30:18,380 --> 02:30:20,380
Thank you.

1740
02:30:20,380 --> 02:30:21,380
Thank you.

1741
02:30:21,380 --> 02:30:24,380
Please watch this video a lot.

1742
02:30:24,380 --> 02:30:27,380
I cut the video, so you can see it easily.

1743
02:30:27,380 --> 02:30:31,380
I cut the video, so you can see it easily.

1744
02:30:31,380 --> 02:30:33,380
The butt.

1745
02:30:33,380 --> 02:30:35,380
The part that feels good.

1746
02:30:35,380 --> 02:30:37,380
The last angle.

1747
02:30:37,380 --> 02:30:39,380
Please watch various parts.

1748
02:30:39,380 --> 02:30:40,380
Good night.

1749
02:30:40,380 --> 02:30:42,380
Thank you very much.

1750
02:30:42,380 --> 02:30:43,380
Thank you very much.

1751
02:30:43,380 --> 02:30:47,380
Thank you for supporting me.

1752
02:30:47,380 --> 02:30:50,380
I'm sorry I'm recording today.

1753
02:30:50,380 --> 02:30:55,380
I'll record the last part next time.

1754
02:30:55,380 --> 02:31:01,380
I'll do my best to be in good shape this month.

1755
02:31:01,380 --> 02:31:06,380
I'll do it in three weeks.

1756
02:31:06,380 --> 02:31:07,380
Thank you.

1757
02:31:07,380 --> 02:31:08,380
Good night.

1758
02:31:08,380 --> 02:31:09,380
Good night.

1759
02:31:09,380 --> 02:31:10,380
I love you.

1760
02:31:10,380 --> 02:31:12,380
Thank you.

1761
02:31:14,380 --> 02:31:16,380
Good night.

1762
02:31:16,380 --> 02:31:17,380
Thank you.

1763
02:31:17,380 --> 02:31:19,380
Bye bye.

1764
02:31:19,380 --> 02:31:21,380
Bye bye.

1765
02:31:21,380 --> 02:31:24,380
Good night.
