Yeon.

Yes, it's me.

9
00:01:45,254 --> 00:01:46,324
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:47,324 --> 00:01:49,295
As I was entering the room,

11
00:01:50,394 --> 00:01:52,565
I could feel myself losing control of my body.

12
00:01:54,725 --> 00:01:57,094
It's all right. You did good.

13
00:02:00,565 --> 00:02:01,874
I can still feel...

14
00:02:02,305 --> 00:02:05,275
how it swarmed inside my head.

15
00:02:11,344 --> 00:02:12,544
Let's hurry.

16
00:02:13,984 --> 00:02:15,785
At least so I can be myself...

17
00:02:17,055 --> 00:02:18,925
right before it all ends.

18
00:02:22,025 --> 00:02:25,294
I want to be there beside you.

19
00:02:31,964 --> 00:02:33,134
Let's end this.

20
00:02:34,734 --> 00:02:36,634
Let's put an end...

21
00:02:38,175 --> 00:02:39,344
to this exhausting fight.

22
00:03:08,874 --> 00:03:10,075
Are you okay?

23
00:03:22,284 --> 00:03:23,784
Drive.

24
00:03:24,284 --> 00:03:25,325
Why?

25
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:29,124
- Why are you doing this? - What?

26
00:03:29,455 --> 00:03:31,694
Is it fun to bring chaos to the world?

27
00:03:32,365 --> 00:03:33,365
Is that what motivates you?

28
00:03:33,564 --> 00:03:34,865
No.

29
00:03:35,694 --> 00:03:38,404
Truth be told, I actually prefer reading books.

30
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,064
Then why are you doing this?

31
00:03:40,064 --> 00:03:42,004
Because I want Lee Yeon dead.

32
00:03:43,335 --> 00:03:45,575
And you think he'll easily cave in?

33
00:03:45,575 --> 00:03:46,705
That's why I'm doing this.

34
00:03:47,874 --> 00:03:50,515
He won't stop his fight against me.

35
00:03:50,974 --> 00:03:53,244
He keeps trying to defy destiny.

36
00:03:56,914 --> 00:03:58,784
There's no turning back now.

37
00:04:00,754 --> 00:04:04,295
We've both crossed the line, you see.

38
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:08,664
Mr. Lee!

39
00:04:15,135 --> 00:04:16,305
Did you get hurt?

40
00:04:17,275 --> 00:04:18,374
Not really.

41
00:04:18,705 --> 00:04:20,904
Well, you're about to.

42
00:04:21,244 --> 00:04:22,275
How dare you fool me.

43
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:26,314
- This was the only way. - Shut it.

44
00:04:26,314 --> 00:04:27,814
It was pretty obvious...

45
00:04:27,814 --> 00:04:29,314
when he gathered us all for the meeting.

46
00:04:29,615 --> 00:04:30,684
As if you knew.

47
00:04:30,684 --> 00:04:32,154
He wouldn't have blabbed about the Sin Slayer...

48
00:04:32,154 --> 00:04:33,624
had he found the real one.

49
00:04:33,624 --> 00:04:35,825
He would've bulldozed over and slayed her.

50
00:04:35,825 --> 00:04:36,855
What?

51
00:04:37,124 --> 00:04:39,724
I'm saying that he's a man of action,

52
00:04:39,724 --> 00:04:41,224
not words.

53
00:04:41,735 --> 00:04:44,164
So were you able to get your answer?

54
00:04:44,164 --> 00:04:45,705
I guess.

55
00:04:47,064 --> 00:04:48,205
And what would that be?

56
00:04:48,775 --> 00:04:50,635
- A key. - A key to what?

57
00:04:50,805 --> 00:04:53,404
The one Imoogi needs to jump from body to body.

58
00:04:54,305 --> 00:04:56,615
Do we have a way to drag it out of Ms. Nam then?

59
00:04:58,814 --> 00:04:59,944
I can't be satisfied with that.

60
00:05:02,814 --> 00:05:03,814
What?

61
00:05:04,284 --> 00:05:07,284
My plan is to keep it buried forever...

62
00:05:08,284 --> 00:05:09,895
so that it never resurfaces.

63
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,395
Stop right there.

64
00:05:14,224 --> 00:05:15,495
You heard me!

65
00:05:16,135 --> 00:05:17,594
The moment you step past those doors,

66
00:05:17,594 --> 00:05:19,065
you'll lose everything.

67
00:05:19,065 --> 00:05:20,565
I'll make sure of it!

68
00:05:33,645 --> 00:05:36,714
And what is it do I have to lose?

69
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,284
The Gatekeeper of Samdo River,

70

powers that nearly match an Almighty,

71
00:05:41,955 --> 00:05:44,025
and an immortal life. I gave you all of that!

72
00:05:44,395 --> 00:05:46,364
What I want though aren't those.

73
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:47,964
It's my wife and son.

74
00:05:49,335 --> 00:05:53,005
Honey, but living with you forever now...

75
00:05:55,435 --> 00:05:57,174
is my biggest punishment of all.

76
00:06:03,214 --> 00:06:04,315
Stop right there.

77
00:06:04,914 --> 00:06:06,344
I told you to stop!

80
00:06:38,984 --> 00:06:40,015

81
00:06:40,414 --> 00:06:41,445
Are you all right?

82
00:06:42,284 --> 00:06:43,414
What did Mr. Choi say?

83
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:45,284
A police officer passed away.

84
00:06:45,784 --> 00:06:48,185
- Cause of death? - He says it was a heart attack,

85
00:06:48,594 --> 00:06:51,964
but Mr. Choi noticed odd spots on his body while performing CPR.

86
00:06:52,195 --> 00:06:54,294
Also, he spit out an egg.

87
00:06:55,734 --> 00:06:56,794
An egg?

88
00:06:59,464 --> 00:07:01,234
Are they still with your boss?

00:07:01,635 --> 00:07:02,705
Where are you right now?

90
00:07:05,775 --> 00:07:08,145
So much for peace and quiet in my latter years.

91
00:07:08,245 --> 00:07:10,515
Never did I think I'd see a man...

Guys, get away from him right now.

94
00:07:17,185 --> 00:07:18,255
Got it.

95
00:07:23,794 --> 00:07:26,125
Mr. Choi was at the police station?

96
00:07:26,265 --> 00:07:29,895
Yes, he performed CPR on the victim.

97
00:07:30,234 --> 00:07:31,664

There's a rapid increase in the number of victim's dying.

102

Head home first.

Don't go there alone and let them take you.

You must hurry, Yeon.

My wife will soon alter Ji A's date of death on the list.

What's wrong?

109

It's just like he warned me.

110
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,265
What do you mean?

111
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:36,065
He told me he'll spread a virus...

112
00:08:36,695 --> 00:08:39,205
and kill everyone that's precious to me.

113
00:08:41,265 --> 00:08:43,375
Wait. My parents.

114
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:46,044
I'll go check up on them. You should go and wait for Mr. Lee.

115
00:08:46,205 --> 00:08:47,804
- But... - Don't worry.

116

Mr. Lee Rang, please take her home.

117
00:08:59,854 --> 00:09:01,455
Ask me politely to take you home.

118
00:09:01,955 --> 00:09:03,395
I'd rather die than do that.

119
00:09:03,395 --> 00:09:04,554
Then just die.

I won't be there to help you when Imoogi comes for you.

121
00:09:07,765 --> 00:09:10,265
To me, you're no different from him.

122
00:09:10,265 --> 00:09:12,604
Doesn't that apply to you?

123
00:09:12,804 --> 00:09:13,964
You're the female Imoogi.

124
00:09:14,534 --> 00:09:17,674
- Let's just go our own ways. - As you wish.

125
00:09:27,015 --> 00:09:28,385
She's so stubborn.

126
00:09:29,554 --> 00:09:32,025
I really don't get what Yeon likes about her.

127
00:09:57,914 --> 00:09:59,645
What? What's wrong with this?

128

Wait. You dropped...

Mr. Hyeonuiong?

130

Fortunately,

131
00:10:50,265 --> 00:10:51,765
I got here on time.

132
00:10:58,334 --> 00:11:01,275
Are you sure you didn't get hurt?

133
00:11:01,574 --> 00:11:02,674
I'm okay.

134
00:11:04,115 --> 00:11:07,845
The gatekeeper of Samdo River is involved in this?

135
00:11:08,814 --> 00:11:09,985
Thank goodness.

00:11:11,985 --> 00:11:14,725
It looks like something big is about to happen soon.

137
00:11:37,015 --> 00:11:41,314
- Granny. - Choose your words wisely.

138
00:11:42,184 --> 00:11:45,554
I'm in a very bad mood just as much as you are.

139
00:11:45,784 --> 00:11:47,584
You messed with the list?

140
00:11:48,154 --> 00:11:49,794
You turned your back on me...

141
00:11:49,895 --> 00:11:53,495
and did something you won't even be able to forgive yourself for?

142
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:56,664
You really chose to do that?

143
00:11:56,794 --> 00:12:00,105
No matter what you say, I won't withdraw what I wrote.

144
00:12:00,934 --> 00:12:02,074
That is...

145
00:12:03,204 --> 00:12:04,534
my choice.

146
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:09,475
Why not just kill the guy who spread the plague? Why Ji A?

147
00:12:10,345 --> 00:12:14,544
You already know you can't kill him with a sword.

148
00:12:21,084 --> 00:12:22,355
I see the blade won't kill you.

149
00:12:25,025 --> 00:12:27,495
The problem is what lives inside the girl's body.

150
00:12:27,694 --> 00:12:30,194
We need to destroy that in order to destroy the other one.

151
00:12:30,194 --> 00:12:31,294
And to do that,

152
00:12:32,965 --> 00:12:34,635
she needs to die.

153
00:12:37,975 --> 00:12:39,345
I'm only going to say this once.

154
00:12:40,275 --> 00:12:41,375
Return things...

155
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,544
back to how they were.

156
00:12:49,414 --> 00:12:51,015
This is how it should be.

157
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,355
That's the only way it'll end.

158
00:12:55,385 --> 00:12:56,454
No.

159
00:12:58,054 --> 00:12:59,194
I won't let anyone...

160
00:13:00,225 --> 00:13:01,564
take Ji A away.

161
00:13:07,304 --> 00:13:09,375
And that includes you.

162
00:13:09,804 --> 00:13:11,904
It's out of your hands now.

163
00:13:35,294 --> 00:13:36,395
Go ahead.

164
00:13:46,704 --> 00:13:48,775
Are you saying accidents like earlier...

165
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:54,544
will keep happening until I die?

166
00:13:58,885 --> 00:14:01,054
I'm glad I got to see my parents one last time.

167
00:14:02,194 --> 00:14:03,324
I'm sorry.

168
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,995
Why are you sorry?

169
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,424
You saved my life.

170
00:14:10,064 --> 00:14:12,334
I tried my best to stop this.

171
00:14:12,804 --> 00:14:15,834
But this is all I can do.

172
00:14:20,704 --> 00:14:21,845
What about Yeon?

173
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:25,515
He went to settle things with my wife.

174
00:14:27,584 --> 00:14:30,184
- Will he be okay? - I don't know.

175
00:14:31,015 --> 00:14:35,324
Once my wife is convinced that she is right,

176
00:14:35,595 --> 00:14:37,554
she never changes her mind.

177
00:14:38,554 --> 00:14:39,924
And Yeon knows that.

178
00:14:40,265 --> 00:14:41,495
Then could he get hurt...

179
00:14:42,534 --> 00:14:43,735
because of me?

180
00:14:43,834 --> 00:14:47,865
He's probably willing to risk everything he has right now.

181
00:14:59,284 --> 00:15:00,485
You can use this to take my life.

182
00:15:02,954 --> 00:15:04,454
Just give me three more days.

183
00:15:06,054 --> 00:15:08,584
If I don't catch him within three days,

184
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:13,564
then just kill me with this.

185
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,095
I can't do that.

186
00:15:18,194 --> 00:15:20,164
He's already out of control.

187
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,845
- I have his scale. - It's too late.

188
00:15:26,845 --> 00:15:29,074
I can catch him! I can catch Imoogi!

189
00:15:29,074 --> 00:15:32,584
How many more lives do you think he'll take within those three days?

190
00:15:32,715 --> 00:15:36,184
Their lives are just as important as the life you wish to save.

191
00:15:56,235 --> 00:15:57,304
Please don't do this.

192
00:16:05,314 --> 00:16:06,814
Please don't kill Ji A.

193
00:16:09,184 --> 00:16:10,414
I'll do anything.

194
00:16:10,414 --> 00:16:13,324
- I'll do anything you ask. - Just fight me instead.

195
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:17,025
Cut the nonsense and just fight me like you'd normally do.

196
00:16:17,554 --> 00:16:18,625
Please.

197
00:16:24,495 --> 00:16:25,664
Get up.

198
00:16:27,005 --> 00:16:30,304
I wouldn't have started this if I was going to change my mind.

199
00:16:33,745 --> 00:16:35,645
How could you do this to me?

200
00:16:36,074 --> 00:16:38,975
I've already lost my child and husband, so I can do much worse.

201
00:16:41,284 --> 00:16:43,385
Even if that means I'll end up losing you.

202
00:16:50,554 --> 00:16:51,895
You'll regret this,

203
00:16:53,324 --> 00:16:54,324
Granny.

204
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,105
Where did it all go wrong?

205
00:17:05,975 --> 00:17:08,674
If it weren't for me, Yeon would still be...

206
00:17:10,345 --> 00:17:13,914
living as a mountain spirit.

207
00:17:16,115 --> 00:17:17,215
No.

208
00:17:18,355 --> 00:17:20,725
I never should've been born.

209
00:17:21,485 --> 00:17:24,255
Listen. It's not your fault.

210
00:17:25,194 --> 00:17:26,965
Don't hate yourself...

211
00:17:27,595 --> 00:17:29,865
and deny the connection you have with him.

212
00:17:30,135 --> 00:17:32,294
I feel like it's all my fault.

213
00:17:32,294 --> 00:17:34,934
We may be immortal, but we're just like humans.

214
00:17:35,135 --> 00:17:37,534
Our happy and precious memories are what keeps us going.

215
00:17:38,135 --> 00:17:40,145
For me, it's the memory of my son.

216
00:17:40,745 --> 00:17:42,845
For the Snail Bride, it's the memory of her sweet husband.

217
00:17:44,174 --> 00:17:47,215
And Yeon managed to keep living thanks to you.

218
00:17:48,084 --> 00:17:49,755
Imoogi told me...

219
00:17:50,355 --> 00:17:53,255
that I'll eventually end up killing Yeon...

220
00:17:55,354 --> 00:17:57,294
with my own two hands.

221
00:17:57,294 --> 00:17:58,455
That's why...

222
00:17:59,195 --> 00:18:02,064
both you and Yeon are trying so hard...

223
00:18:02,735 --> 00:18:04,695
to protect each other.

224
00:18:41,634 --> 00:18:43,675
I'm surrounded by dead ends.

225
00:18:59,824 --> 00:19:02,354
Darn it. It won't light.

226
00:19:03,324 --> 00:19:04,925
I thought you were quitting.

227
00:19:08,624 --> 00:19:12,394
I've tried all sorts of things to quit.

228
00:19:12,965 --> 00:19:16,634
I chewed on mints, stuck on patches, tried gums,

229
00:19:16,634 --> 00:19:18,235
and even prescription medicine.

230
00:19:20,044 --> 00:19:23,544
I tried all of that, but I still couldn't quit.

231
00:19:25,275 --> 00:19:26,344
What are you talking about?

232
00:19:26,945 --> 00:19:28,745
What if, no matter how hard you try,

233
00:19:28,745 --> 00:19:31,114
the ending will stay the same?

234
00:19:32,215 --> 00:19:36,124
If only one of you can survive, either you or the girl.

235
00:19:37,495 --> 00:19:38,695
The ending...

236
00:19:40,864 --> 00:19:42,294
won't change. I see.

237
00:20:11,824 --> 00:20:12,965
Want me to blow on it?

238
00:20:13,225 --> 00:20:15,765
- Are you kidding me? - Or do you want my car?

239
00:20:17,334 --> 00:20:18,564
Why do I bother?

240
00:20:18,665 --> 00:20:21,765
And hey, kid. Do something about your runny nose when you're with me.

241
00:20:22,165 --> 00:20:24,405
I have a weak stomach.

242
00:20:27,705 --> 00:20:30,814
How long have you been wearing that? Did you even wash it?

243
00:20:43,525 --> 00:20:45,195
Buy some clothes at a department store.

244
00:20:45,394 --> 00:20:47,364
I'm very sensitive regarding hygiene.

245
00:20:51,594 --> 00:20:53,165
I'm going to the bathroom.

246
00:20:56,074 --> 00:20:57,574
What are all these stickers?

247
00:20:58,104 --> 00:20:59,475
You're dead when I come out!

248
00:21:05,874 --> 00:21:07,114
What a nice day.

249
00:21:07,614 --> 00:21:08,685
It's gorgeous out.

250
00:21:09,854 --> 00:21:10,854
Your coffee.

251
00:21:12,685 --> 00:21:14,485
This tree grew a lot.

252
00:21:16,324 --> 00:21:18,955
It did. It grew nicely.

253
00:21:22,525 --> 00:21:24,794
What are you thinking about?

254
00:21:25,064 --> 00:21:26,905
Where were we...

255
00:21:28,165 --> 00:21:30,104
while this much time passed?

256
00:21:30,175 --> 00:21:33,175
Right? They say we were missing for years.

257
00:21:33,604 --> 00:21:35,104
It feels strange, doesn't it?

258
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,314
All I know is that we were asleep the whole time.

259
00:21:38,175 --> 00:21:40,245
It's odd that we don't have any pressure ulcers on our bodies.

260
00:21:40,814 --> 00:21:43,284
And it's odd how nervous Ji A is too.

261
00:21:45,015 --> 00:21:46,824
It reminds me of "Io Island".

262
00:21:47,725 --> 00:21:48,784
"Io Island"?

263
00:21:49,155 --> 00:21:52,155
You know, a fisherman accidentally ends up on a fantasy island,

264
00:21:52,425 --> 00:21:56,235
and when he leaves, he realizes 100 years had passed.

265
00:21:58,334 --> 00:22:01,864
Ji A grew really well, just like that tree,

266
00:22:02,034 --> 00:22:03,074
so I'm grateful.

267
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,995
Is this all we're eating?

268
00:22:28,025 --> 00:22:29,165
It's good.

269
00:22:30,165 --> 00:22:31,834
I want naengmyeon.

270
00:22:33,235 --> 00:22:34,235
Yu Ri.

271
00:22:34,334 --> 00:22:35,905
When is she coming?

272
00:22:36,374 --> 00:22:37,675
I'm wondering...

273
00:22:38,104 --> 00:22:39,304
when would be good.

274
00:22:39,475 --> 00:22:40,975
Why are you only thinking?

275
00:22:42,475 --> 00:22:44,074
Because once I finish thinking,

276
00:22:44,745 --> 00:22:46,644
Yeon will lose something.

277
00:22:47,844 --> 00:22:49,584
It has been over 600 years.

278
00:22:50,185 --> 00:22:52,554
I plan to end this fight once and for all.

279
00:22:52,755 --> 00:22:54,025
What if you fail?

280
00:22:54,685 --> 00:22:56,025
Rang.

281
00:22:57,394 --> 00:22:59,824
That's why I need you.

282
00:23:01,495 --> 00:23:03,594
If by chance something happens to me,

283
00:23:05,495 --> 00:23:08,465
I'd like you to finish this yourself.

284
00:23:10,134 --> 00:23:14,074
I'd like you to be my final weapon.

285
00:23:15,844 --> 00:23:16,945
I refuse.

286
00:23:18,374 --> 00:23:20,044
Whether Imoogi destroys the world...

287
00:23:20,044 --> 00:23:22,114
or kills your woman, I don't care.

288
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:24,354
We want to protect different things.

289
00:23:27,225 --> 00:23:29,554
- Rang. - You protect her.

290
00:23:30,824 --> 00:23:32,695
I'll free Yu Ri...

291
00:23:34,225 --> 00:23:35,495
and save you.

292
00:23:44,205 --> 00:23:45,334
Why are you smiling?

293
00:23:45,935 --> 00:23:49,074
I feel like being a good boy really isn't my thing.

294
00:23:50,314 --> 00:23:51,314
Later.

295
00:23:56,114 --> 00:23:58,255
Watch the apartment, Geomdoong.

296
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,655
Why am I Geomdoong?

297
00:24:06,025 --> 00:24:07,064
Shi Young.

298
00:24:07,165 --> 00:24:08,925
Oh, my. Hello.

299
00:24:09,425 --> 00:24:12,094
What brings you here at this hour?

300
00:24:12,134 --> 00:24:15,235
Well... I wanted to have a bowl of samgyetang.

301
00:24:17,604 --> 00:24:21,175
But... You're not sick or anything, right?

302
00:24:21,175 --> 00:24:23,044
Of course, not.

303
00:24:23,644 --> 00:24:26,945
I do 200 squats a day.

304
00:24:26,945 --> 00:24:28,185
Do you want to see?

305
00:24:28,245 --> 00:24:29,284
Goodness.

306
00:24:29,554 --> 00:24:30,584
- Have a seat. - Okay.

307
00:24:33,554 --> 00:24:34,584
Serve him.

308
00:24:34,584 --> 00:24:36,725
Seven cops were taken to the hospital this morning.

309
00:24:37,294 --> 00:24:38,624
What about Mr. Choi?

310
00:24:39,025 --> 00:24:40,495
You saw him. He was fine.

311
00:24:40,894 --> 00:24:43,995
I told him to see a doctor anyway, but he won't listen.

312
00:24:44,735 --> 00:24:48,304
If he's okay, we should be okay too, right?

313
00:24:48,534 --> 00:24:51,905
Let's worry about editing. Walk faster.

314
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:58,114
You must be busy prepping for the day.

315
00:24:59,144 --> 00:25:02,515
I felt a weird taste in my mouth. I feel so much better now.

316
00:25:07,084 --> 00:25:08,155
What's wrong?

317
00:25:11,155 --> 00:25:12,995
You don't look well.

318
00:25:12,995 --> 00:25:15,495
Do I have a fever?

319
00:25:17,165 --> 00:25:19,364
Not at all. You're so cold.

320
00:25:19,705 --> 00:25:21,935
Give me your hand. Your hand's cold too.

321
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:24,574
How could your body temperature drop this much?

322
00:25:43,155 --> 00:25:44,255
It's a snake egg.

323
00:25:48,765 --> 00:25:50,995
He's sleeping again. Wake up.

324
00:25:51,364 --> 00:25:53,064
Excuse me. Wake up.

325
00:25:53,465 --> 00:25:55,965
Sir?

326
00:25:59,034 --> 00:26:00,044
What happened?

327
00:26:04,475 --> 00:26:06,314
He... He's dead.

328
00:26:07,584 --> 00:26:10,715
Hey. Call an ambulance. I'll go get help.

329
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:46,425
What?

330
00:26:46,824 --> 00:26:47,884
They died?

331
00:26:48,384 --> 00:26:50,354
Everyone on our floor?

332
00:26:51,294 --> 00:26:52,324
Hold on.

333
00:26:57,235 --> 00:27:00,935
Breaking news. People are dying from unknown causes...

334
00:27:00,935 --> 00:27:02,064
in masses.

335
00:27:02,334 --> 00:27:06,175
The first of such deaths occurred only two days ago.

336
00:27:06,405 --> 00:27:09,374
It is presumed to be a highly lethal,

337
00:27:09,374 --> 00:27:11,415
highly contagious disease.

338
00:27:11,745 --> 00:27:14,745
All of the victims had red spots...

339
00:27:14,745 --> 00:27:16,114
all over their bodies.

340
00:27:16,144 --> 00:27:19,384
According to the autopsy report of the first victim,

341
00:27:19,384 --> 00:27:21,685
his organs showed signs of fatal injuries...

342
00:27:21,685 --> 00:27:23,695
as if attacked by a wild animal.

343
00:27:23,854 --> 00:27:26,294
Kim, a man in his 30s,

344
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:28,225
had no underlying illness...

345
00:27:43,475 --> 00:27:45,445
- How is it? - It's lame.

346
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:47,144
It's not my style.

347
00:27:47,144 --> 00:27:48,215
So it's normal.

348
00:27:51,015 --> 00:27:52,015
Where are you going now?

349
00:27:52,015 --> 00:27:53,225
I want to get some free tea.

350
00:27:54,225 --> 00:27:55,784
I'll grant you a visit to commemorate.

351
00:27:57,854 --> 00:27:59,425
- A visit? - With your boyfriend.

352
00:28:00,495 --> 00:28:01,525
Go see him.

353
00:28:15,104 --> 00:28:17,445
Yu... Yu Ri. Are you okay?

354
00:28:17,814 --> 00:28:19,915
Let's meet up right now.

355
00:28:20,415 --> 00:28:21,445
Right now?

356
00:28:24,015 --> 00:28:25,015
Where?

357
00:28:26,755 --> 00:28:28,025
I'll come to you.

358
00:28:49,604 --> 00:28:50,715
Come out.

359
00:28:52,574 --> 00:28:54,284
I know you're hiding inside of me.

360
00:28:55,114 --> 00:28:56,314
Come out!

361
00:28:59,455 --> 00:29:00,985
Show yourself by the count of three, or...

362
00:29:05,324 --> 00:29:06,495
I'll kill myself.

363
00:29:08,725 --> 00:29:11,794
One, two,

364
00:29:13,064 --> 00:29:14,165
three.

365
00:29:23,745 --> 00:29:25,574
Crazy wench.

366
00:29:28,144 --> 00:29:30,814
You dare to summon me when you're merely a shell?

367
00:29:32,314 --> 00:29:33,425
A shell?

368
00:29:34,384 --> 00:29:37,054
That's rich coming from a squatter...

369
00:29:37,255 --> 00:29:38,755
who's staying rent-free.

370
00:29:38,894 --> 00:29:40,624
Well, your body will completely be mine soon.

371
00:29:42,195 --> 00:29:44,364
I'll give it a day or so.

372
00:29:45,094 --> 00:29:48,265
Soon, I'll be in full control of your body.

373
00:29:48,465 --> 00:29:50,034
That's slower than I thought.

374
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:51,935
Why?

375
00:29:52,505 --> 00:29:55,104
It's been a while since I lost the fox bead.

376
00:29:55,104 --> 00:29:56,405
Call it the aftermath.

377
00:29:56,715 --> 00:29:58,814
I've been bound by it for too long.

378
00:29:59,915 --> 00:30:01,584
Anyway, say your goodbyes when you can.

379
00:30:02,284 --> 00:30:03,955
Once I take control of your body,

380
00:30:04,384 --> 00:30:07,284
you'll be the one who falls asleep in it...

381
00:30:07,554 --> 00:30:09,384
forever.

382
00:30:10,425 --> 00:30:13,425
In other words, you're not in a stable state...

383
00:30:14,265 --> 00:30:16,025
until that happens.

384
00:30:16,794 --> 00:30:19,905
Darn. What can you possibly do about it though?

385
00:30:20,334 --> 00:30:22,005
What if I die before you take control?

386
00:30:23,334 --> 00:30:24,775
You'll never be able to.

387
00:30:25,975 --> 00:30:27,205
You see,

388
00:30:27,975 --> 00:30:31,475
people can do just about anything to save those they love...

389
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,455
like going absolutely crazy.

390
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:42,685
Help!

391
00:30:43,084 --> 00:30:44,554
- What's wrong with him? - Sir!

392
00:30:44,655 --> 00:30:46,725
Please help. What's happening?

393
00:30:46,725 --> 00:30:47,794
My gosh.

394
00:30:49,195 --> 00:30:51,995
Somebody help. Call an ambulance!

395
00:30:52,294 --> 00:30:53,864
Can anybody help me?

396
00:30:59,175 --> 00:31:00,475
You psycho.

397
00:31:00,475 --> 00:31:01,574
That'll be all.

398
00:31:02,604 --> 00:31:04,074
You can go back to sleep now.

399
00:31:05,144 --> 00:31:06,945
That's all I wanted to confirm.

400
00:31:09,415 --> 00:31:13,384
Listen, you woman. Lee Yeon will perish because of you.

401
00:31:14,525 --> 00:31:18,054
For he won't be able to give up on you.

402
00:31:18,155 --> 00:31:20,695
Rather than worrying about my love life,

403
00:31:21,195 --> 00:31:22,765
I advise you to worry more about your partner.

404
00:31:24,034 --> 00:31:26,765
Being rejected must've hit him hard...

405
00:31:27,034 --> 00:31:30,374
because he's planning to take us both with him to the Underworld.

406
00:31:31,104 --> 00:31:32,334
That's absurd.

407
00:31:32,634 --> 00:31:33,945
My date of death has been altered.

408
00:31:36,675 --> 00:31:38,544
Do you really believe he had no idea...

409
00:31:38,544 --> 00:31:40,384
that Taluipa would go to such lengths...

410
00:31:40,644 --> 00:31:42,215
to stop him from slaughtering innocent lives?

411
00:31:43,185 --> 00:31:44,314
Are you in here?

412
00:31:44,415 --> 00:31:46,354
Yes, I'll be right out.

413
00:32:01,564 --> 00:32:02,634
Yu Ri!

414
00:32:04,874 --> 00:32:06,405
Are you hurt? Let me see.

415
00:32:07,344 --> 00:32:08,505
I'm fine.

416
00:32:12,114 --> 00:32:13,175
I'm glad.

417
00:32:13,384 --> 00:32:15,445
I was worried sick about you.

418
00:32:15,915 --> 00:32:18,455
How are you here though? Did you manage to escape?

419
00:32:18,515 --> 00:32:20,784
Why didn't you tell me that Imoogi was behind this?

420
00:32:23,455 --> 00:32:25,925
- And Mr. Lee? - He's alive and well.

421
00:32:26,794 --> 00:32:29,624
He never expresses it, but he's worried sick about you too.

422
00:32:30,965 --> 00:32:31,995
I'm glad.

423
00:32:33,064 --> 00:32:35,965
Let's go. He'll be thrilled to know...

424
00:32:35,965 --> 00:32:37,475
- that you're back... - I can't.

425
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:39,905
What?

426
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:43,104
I can't go.

427
00:32:43,644 --> 00:32:46,215
I can't and you can't either.

428
00:32:47,344 --> 00:32:48,445
What are you talking about?

429
00:32:48,915 --> 00:32:51,415
I'm keeping you here so that you can't go.

430
00:32:52,155 --> 00:32:53,854
What on earth...

431
00:32:59,794 --> 00:33:00,864
No.

432
00:33:04,894 --> 00:33:05,995
Let me go.

433
00:33:07,705 --> 00:33:09,465
I said we both can't go.

434
00:33:12,804 --> 00:33:14,445
I'll grant you a visit to commemorate.

435
00:33:15,074 --> 00:33:17,975
With your boyfriend. Go see him.

436
00:33:20,515 --> 00:33:22,415
Why must I do as you say?

437
00:33:24,854 --> 00:33:26,985
Because if I lay my eyes on Shin Ju today,

438
00:33:27,824 --> 00:33:29,025
he'll die.

439
00:33:43,407 --> 00:33:45,438
- Hey, Dad. - My daughter.

440
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:48,208
- Where are you? - Out, of course.

441
00:33:48,538 --> 00:33:51,647
- Why do you ask? - A friend of yours came by.

442
00:33:52,647 --> 00:33:54,647
A friend? Who?

443
00:33:55,248 --> 00:33:57,617
I told you not to open the door for anyone.

444
00:33:57,617 --> 00:34:00,788
Well, it was a face we recognized.

445
00:34:02,317 --> 00:34:04,288
Who can you possibly know?

446
00:34:05,758 --> 00:34:07,558
- Yeon? - No.

447
00:34:08,058 --> 00:34:10,468
That young man with a fair complexion.

448
00:34:11,097 --> 00:34:12,198
The carnation.

449
00:34:14,468 --> 00:34:15,567
What?

450
00:34:20,407 --> 00:34:24,478
I told you that I won't be as nice to you anymore.

451
00:34:24,907 --> 00:34:28,048
You'll pay if you lay a finger on them...

452
00:34:28,048 --> 00:34:29,478
Don't defy your destiny.

453
00:34:30,887 --> 00:34:33,917
I can shatter everything you cherish.

454
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:39,357
Who are you? You're not Ji A's friend, are you?

455
00:34:40,298 --> 00:34:42,058
No, Mom. Don't!

456
00:34:43,357 --> 00:34:44,998
"I wish to hang myself."

457
00:34:45,698 --> 00:34:46,867
No!

458
00:34:50,472 --> 00:34:51,912
"I wish to hang myself."

459
00:34:52,912 --> 00:34:54,043
No!

460
00:34:59,313 --> 00:35:00,452
You can't leave.

461
00:35:00,853 --> 00:35:02,552
No, I must go.

462
00:35:02,952 --> 00:35:05,853
My mom and dad are in danger. Please...

463
00:35:06,892 --> 00:35:07,992
Oh, no.

464
00:35:55,372 --> 00:35:56,943
Sleep.

465
00:36:10,052 --> 00:36:11,622
How did you know I was here?

466
00:36:13,023 --> 00:36:14,622
I'm coming back from Samdo River.

467
00:36:14,622 --> 00:36:16,622
The old lady with the Clairvoyance?

468
00:36:16,622 --> 00:36:19,133
She changed the date of Ji A's death...

469
00:36:19,793 --> 00:36:21,802
thanks to you spreading the plague.

470
00:36:21,802 --> 00:36:22,903
But she's still alive.

471
00:36:23,603 --> 00:36:25,103
I just talked to her on the phone.

472
00:36:25,103 --> 00:36:27,773
Hyeonuiong's protecting her in my absence.

473
00:36:28,872 --> 00:36:30,673
Although, I doubt he'll be able to last.

474
00:36:30,673 --> 00:36:31,912
You said you're coming from Samdo River.

475
00:36:32,072 --> 00:36:34,142
Why didn't you beg the old lady for mercy?

476
00:36:35,342 --> 00:36:37,012
That I already did.

477
00:36:39,052 --> 00:36:40,253
So it didn't work.

478
00:36:42,822 --> 00:36:47,122
If Ji A dies, the other half of you will perish too.

479
00:36:48,722 --> 00:36:49,793
So?

480
00:36:51,532 --> 00:36:53,702
What is it that you truly want?

481
00:36:54,162 --> 00:36:55,262
Take a guess.

482
00:36:57,103 --> 00:36:59,932
You exist to lack love.

483
00:37:00,943 --> 00:37:03,403
Even as a human and even now.

484
00:37:04,713 --> 00:37:06,572
The Almighty created a being...

485
00:37:06,572 --> 00:37:08,983
that gets the short straw on everything.

486
00:37:08,983 --> 00:37:10,043
That's you, Imoogi.

487
00:37:14,423 --> 00:37:15,622
Is a war what you want?

488
00:37:15,883 --> 00:37:18,193
No, the opposite, actually.

489
00:37:18,693 --> 00:37:21,063
- What? - What if there was something...

490
00:37:21,063 --> 00:37:22,693
other than your obsession with me and Ji A...

491
00:37:22,693 --> 00:37:24,333
that can satisfy you?

492
00:37:26,733 --> 00:37:30,003
What if you were given a chance to obtain a position not allowed...

493
00:37:30,633 --> 00:37:31,872
to even lower-class mountain spirit?

494
00:37:32,472 --> 00:37:34,403
Enough with the cryptic talk.

495
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,100
The highest of all spirits.

496
00:37:38,439 --> 00:37:39,439
No way.

497
00:37:44,109 --> 00:37:45,780
The gatekeeper of Samdo River.

498
00:38:24,727 --> 00:38:27,437
Let's join hands and kill the gatekeeper of Samdo River.

499
00:38:31,866 --> 00:38:34,906
How interesting. This is quite unexpected.

500
00:38:35,277 --> 00:38:37,547
I had no idea you'd think of betraying that old woman.

501
00:38:37,647 --> 00:38:41,176
I'll do anything to save Ji A.

502
00:38:42,716 --> 00:38:43,817
So...

503
00:38:44,386 --> 00:38:45,946
you're going to hold hands with me?

504
00:38:46,587 --> 00:38:50,587
Of course. Even if that means I need to get my hands dirty with you.

505
00:38:51,987 --> 00:38:52,987
And what's the condition?

506
00:38:53,926 --> 00:38:55,096
Let Ji A go.

507
00:38:56,457 --> 00:38:59,067
Get rid of your other half from her body once and for all.

508
00:38:59,397 --> 00:39:01,096
And don't ever look for us again.

509
00:39:01,966 --> 00:39:03,196
That's all I want.

510
00:39:03,196 --> 00:39:05,806
If you were in my shoes, would you not think that it could be a trap?

511
00:39:07,777 --> 00:39:09,036
No, I wouldn't.

512
00:39:10,076 --> 00:39:11,107
What?

513
00:39:19,846 --> 00:39:21,056
Then try and guess...

514
00:39:22,487 --> 00:39:23,786
what my answer is going to be.

515
00:39:25,386 --> 00:39:28,257
You'd probably love to say no.

516
00:39:28,926 --> 00:39:30,727
But you'll eventually accept my offer.

517
00:39:33,667 --> 00:39:35,536
Where does that confidence come from?

518
00:39:41,076 --> 00:39:42,737
Because we're both at a dead end.

519
00:39:44,176 --> 00:39:47,647
If you reject my offer, you'll lose your other half.

520
00:39:48,277 --> 00:39:49,846
And I'll lose Ji A.

521
00:39:50,786 --> 00:39:54,257
In the end, we'll fight like crazy and end up in the Underworld.

522
00:39:56,656 --> 00:39:59,987
That's what I've been waiting for after I had my last date with her.

523
00:40:05,127 --> 00:40:06,527
Let me know if you change your mind.

524
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:09,667
You have until the sun rises tomorrow morning.

525
00:40:23,547 --> 00:40:25,846
You knew Imoogi went there to kill them,

526
00:40:26,047 --> 00:40:28,886
but you still kept me here? Why?

527
00:40:30,417 --> 00:40:32,286
Did he threaten you?

528
00:40:32,757 --> 00:40:35,496
Or is he manipulating you just like how he made you stab Mr. Lee Rang?

529
00:40:36,357 --> 00:40:38,067
- It's neither. - Then why?

530
00:40:39,067 --> 00:40:40,096
Why did you do that?

531
00:40:42,096 --> 00:40:44,167
Who cares what happens to those useless humans?

532
00:40:50,977 --> 00:40:52,176
"Useless humans"?

533
00:40:56,647 --> 00:40:58,216
I thought you came to see me.

534
00:40:59,147 --> 00:41:01,216
I was worried about you like crazy!

535
00:41:02,957 --> 00:41:04,156
But...

536
00:41:05,627 --> 00:41:07,027
you just used me as bait.

537
00:41:09,627 --> 00:41:11,067
You used my feelings for you.

538
00:41:12,266 --> 00:41:13,627
- Shin Ju. - Stop.

539
00:41:14,536 --> 00:41:15,866
If you say one more word,

540
00:41:19,737 --> 00:41:22,007
I might actually regret liking you, Yu Ri.

541
00:41:46,326 --> 00:41:49,196
I bet you were really worried. They're both okay.

542
00:41:50,397 --> 00:41:52,167
I erased their memories.

543
00:41:52,806 --> 00:41:55,977
Your parents won't remember meeting Imoogi.

544
00:41:56,636 --> 00:41:58,047
Thank you, Yeon.

545
00:42:03,377 --> 00:42:05,346
It's my fault. I shouldn't have left them alone.

546
00:42:05,346 --> 00:42:06,987
It wasn't your fault.

547
00:42:07,556 --> 00:42:09,957
I know you're always there to protect them.

548
00:42:14,926 --> 00:42:17,766
Thank you for saving Ji A while I was gone.

549
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,797
What's your plan?

550
00:42:21,797 --> 00:42:23,297
I'm going to join hands with Imoogi.

551
00:42:24,707 --> 00:42:26,667
- What? - What do you mean?

552
00:42:27,207 --> 00:42:28,507
Is it because of my wife?

553
00:42:29,207 --> 00:42:30,237
Yes.

554
00:42:30,237 --> 00:42:31,846
I guess my wife...

555
00:42:32,647 --> 00:42:34,317
decided to give up on you.

556
00:42:35,676 --> 00:42:38,716
She gave me a chance to fight one more time.

557
00:42:39,286 --> 00:42:40,687
Be more specific.

558
00:42:41,487 --> 00:42:43,216
I got myself two more days.

559
00:42:43,656 --> 00:42:45,056
And you'll be fine.

560
00:42:45,257 --> 00:42:47,857
Does that mean I'll be...

561
00:42:48,727 --> 00:42:51,196
Yes, of course. I won't let you die.

562
00:42:51,426 --> 00:42:53,266
Not on my watch.

563
00:42:53,266 --> 00:42:54,966
Then what about joining hands with Imoogi?

564
00:42:55,966 --> 00:42:57,707
It's obviously a trap.

565
00:42:58,167 --> 00:42:59,306
I knew it.

566
00:43:01,277 --> 00:43:02,576
What did my wife ask in return?

567
00:43:02,607 --> 00:43:05,746
Nothing. She just asked me to catch him no matter what.

568
00:43:06,306 --> 00:43:07,846
- Yeon. - Next time.

569
00:43:08,616 --> 00:43:09,746
I'll tell you the details next time.

570
00:43:10,176 --> 00:43:11,487
I want to go eat with Ji A.

571
00:43:13,957 --> 00:43:15,187
I'll go get changed.

572
00:43:44,886 --> 00:43:46,587
What if, no matter how hard you try,

573
00:43:46,587 --> 00:43:49,087
the ending will stay the same?

574
00:43:50,056 --> 00:43:53,826
If only one of you can survive, either you or the girl.

575
00:43:54,426 --> 00:43:55,627
The ending...

576
00:43:57,797 --> 00:43:59,227
won't change. I see.

577
00:44:17,277 --> 00:44:19,487
Then there's nothing more to worry about.

578
00:44:23,987 --> 00:44:25,156
What do you plan to do?

579
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:30,727
I'll eat this.

580
00:44:33,496 --> 00:44:36,196
I'll have the Imoogi inside Ji A enter my body instead.

581
00:44:36,297 --> 00:44:38,337
And along with the other half, I'll jump...

582
00:44:38,966 --> 00:44:40,036
into Samdo River.

583
00:44:42,076 --> 00:44:44,607
So that he won't ever be able to resurrect again.

584
00:44:44,906 --> 00:44:47,417
- If you jump into Samdo River... - Yes, I know.

585
00:44:48,917 --> 00:44:50,516
I'll never get a chance to be reborn again.

586
00:44:52,687 --> 00:44:53,846
I also know...

587
00:44:54,857 --> 00:44:56,886
that I won't ever be able to go back to Ji A.

588
00:45:37,766 --> 00:45:39,596
I'm sorry for troubling you.

589
00:45:40,797 --> 00:45:43,297
You could've taken me to a hospital.

590
00:45:43,437 --> 00:45:45,167
It's useless to go there.

591
00:45:45,366 --> 00:45:48,136
This isn't a normal kind of illness, you see.

592
00:45:51,406 --> 00:45:52,707
It's cold.

593
00:45:55,616 --> 00:45:56,777
Hang in there.

594
00:45:57,147 --> 00:45:59,087
This nasty fight...

595
00:45:59,587 --> 00:46:00,987
will soon end.

596
00:46:02,457 --> 00:46:04,357
Make sure you hang in there until then.

597
00:46:07,227 --> 00:46:10,727
I guess I was right. You're not...

598
00:46:10,866 --> 00:46:12,866
an ordinary woman, are you?

599
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:23,636
My goodness, Hyeonuiong.

600
00:46:24,777 --> 00:46:27,616
I was wondering why you weren't at the restaurant.

601
00:46:29,147 --> 00:46:30,317
I'm sorry...

602
00:46:34,757 --> 00:46:35,786
My goodness.

603
00:46:36,886 --> 00:46:38,156
Come see me outside.

604
00:46:45,897 --> 00:46:47,897
Do you even know who he is?

605
00:46:48,196 --> 00:46:50,036
What are you talking about?

606
00:46:50,036 --> 00:46:51,567
He's your husband.

607
00:46:52,136 --> 00:46:54,707
- What? - He's the husband...

608
00:46:54,707 --> 00:46:56,636
from your past life, the man you missed so dearly.

609
00:47:02,076 --> 00:47:04,016
Is anyone there? Hey!

610
00:47:04,016 --> 00:47:05,917
Someone's dying in here!

611
00:47:08,457 --> 00:47:10,386
Darn it!

612
00:47:18,167 --> 00:47:21,366
Are you okay? You have spots all over your body.

613
00:47:21,466 --> 00:47:23,866
Detective, please take me to a hospital.

614
00:47:24,266 --> 00:47:25,507
It'll be useless.

615
00:47:25,667 --> 00:47:27,067
The fatality rate is 100 percent.

616
00:47:27,067 --> 00:47:28,477
The only difference is how long it takes.

617
00:47:32,047 --> 00:47:34,317
How did this happen?

618
00:47:38,516 --> 00:47:42,257
Since when did a police officer wear shoes...

619
00:47:42,757 --> 00:47:45,786
that are spotless like that?

620
00:47:46,027 --> 00:47:48,727
Darn it. Their stupid dress code.

621
00:47:56,167 --> 00:47:57,266
Who sent you?

622
00:47:58,007 --> 00:47:59,366
Yeon? Or...

623
00:47:59,366 --> 00:48:02,437
Why does that matter now? You're dying anyway.

624
00:48:03,737 --> 00:48:06,047
I'm sure you didn't come to watch me die.

625
00:48:06,047 --> 00:48:07,507
I love watching death.

626
00:48:08,116 --> 00:48:10,016
See? I even brought popcorn.

627
00:48:10,716 --> 00:48:13,516
I go to funeral homes on purpose too.

628
00:48:15,056 --> 00:48:16,957
What do you want? Tell me.

629
00:48:17,786 --> 00:48:20,957
How dare you try to make a deal? You're terminal anyway.

630
00:48:22,426 --> 00:48:25,667
Are you still reminiscing about being powerful through Imoogi?

631
00:48:25,966 --> 00:48:30,096
If Imoogi dies, this disease will disappear too, right?

632
00:48:30,437 --> 00:48:31,567
Probably.

633
00:48:31,636 --> 00:48:32,806
Get me out of here.

634
00:48:33,667 --> 00:48:35,237
- Why? - I've served Imoogi...

635
00:48:35,237 --> 00:48:36,806
for much longer than you think.

636
00:48:36,937 --> 00:48:39,377
No one knows as much about him as I do.

637
00:48:39,877 --> 00:48:43,716
So? You'll earn your freedom purely by flapping your gums?

638
00:48:44,147 --> 00:48:45,547
And fix your disease for free?

639
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:49,417
I don't like that.

640
00:48:49,716 --> 00:48:51,457
I stink at fighting.

641
00:48:51,457 --> 00:48:53,227
I hate getting scars.

642
00:48:56,527 --> 00:48:57,966
I get it.

643
00:48:59,096 --> 00:49:02,337
So that's why you're here. To keep your hands clean.

644
00:49:06,207 --> 00:49:11,846
(Holding Cell 2)

645
00:49:11,846 --> 00:49:18,516
(Holding Cell 2)

646
00:49:24,556 --> 00:49:25,656
He got away.

647
00:49:26,727 --> 00:49:27,826
Who did?

648
00:49:30,857 --> 00:49:32,727
The serial killer suspect.

649
00:49:33,366 --> 00:49:34,466
Who let him out?

650
00:49:34,737 --> 00:49:37,496
Well... From what I saw in the surveillance video...

651
00:49:38,337 --> 00:49:40,266
What? Why won't you finish talking?

652
00:49:40,266 --> 00:49:41,437
It was you, Detective Baek.

653
00:49:42,237 --> 00:49:43,377
What?

654
00:49:43,755 --> 00:49:47,556
(Gopbuni's Tripe)

655
00:49:48,126 --> 00:49:49,396
I'll take your order.

656
00:49:49,396 --> 00:49:52,365
We'll take an assortment combo and a bottle of soju.

657
00:49:52,465 --> 00:49:54,396
- Extra cheese, please. - Okay.

658
00:50:04,476 --> 00:50:06,445
(Gopbuni's Tripe)

659
00:50:09,115 --> 00:50:10,976
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

660
00:50:13,646 --> 00:50:15,816
There's so much cheese.

661
00:50:25,825 --> 00:50:28,235
- What? - You're so pretty.

662
00:50:41,275 --> 00:50:42,575
Promise me.

663
00:50:44,746 --> 00:50:45,845
What?

664
00:50:46,345 --> 00:50:48,516
Let's come back here during the first snowfall.

665
00:50:52,226 --> 00:50:53,286
Okay.

666
00:50:54,155 --> 00:50:56,126
Spend Christmas with me.

667
00:50:56,295 --> 00:50:58,525
We'll go back to that beach we went to.

668
00:51:01,766 --> 00:51:04,336
- Okay. - And on New Year's Day,

669
00:51:04,706 --> 00:51:07,306
come over and have tteokguk with my parents.

670
00:51:08,606 --> 00:51:10,606
And on my birthday...

671
00:51:15,476 --> 00:51:16,615
What do you want?

672
00:51:25,286 --> 00:51:26,655
Okay, I'll get it for you.

673
00:51:28,255 --> 00:51:31,126
What must you do in order to keep all of these promises?

674
00:51:38,735 --> 00:51:40,635
I have to live a long life.

675
00:51:46,405 --> 00:51:47,505
Cheers.

676
00:52:02,295 --> 00:52:05,025
What is this? It feels like I asked for it.

677
00:52:05,396 --> 00:52:07,325
You should've told me it was your birthday.

678
00:52:07,525 --> 00:52:10,965
Who celebrates their lunar birthday these days?

679
00:52:11,666 --> 00:52:13,135
Only the moms remember.

680
00:52:16,336 --> 00:52:17,476
It smells nice.

681
00:52:22,775 --> 00:52:24,516
I live alone in my apartment...

682
00:52:25,146 --> 00:52:27,086
with two tropical fish.

683
00:52:27,516 --> 00:52:28,755
Do they have names?

684
00:52:28,755 --> 00:52:30,686
Dukbae and Choonsam.

685
00:52:32,025 --> 00:52:33,586
They're both Kims.

686
00:52:35,195 --> 00:52:39,025
I promised to buy them a large aquarium with this paycheck.

687
00:52:41,166 --> 00:52:42,536
Will you adopt them?

688
00:52:46,706 --> 00:52:48,836
Here. Make a wish.

689
00:52:54,106 --> 00:52:58,586
Please let me get a cake from Jae Hwan next year on my birthday.

690
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:15,295
That's the last of it.

691
00:53:20,965 --> 00:53:24,175
This may be the last soju we ever drink...

692
00:53:24,175 --> 00:53:25,606
together.

693
00:53:28,146 --> 00:53:29,615
I'm going to savor it.

694
00:53:33,186 --> 00:53:34,545
Why would you say that?

695
00:53:35,155 --> 00:53:38,456
The thing inside of me said earlier...

696
00:53:39,056 --> 00:53:41,286
that I have at most two days.

697
00:53:42,025 --> 00:53:45,465
That afterward, I'll be nothing...

698
00:53:45,465 --> 00:53:47,266
but an empty shell.

699
00:53:47,666 --> 00:53:48,836
That won't happen.

700
00:53:49,365 --> 00:53:51,905
Won't it all be better if I disappear?

701
00:53:52,566 --> 00:53:55,606
If I die, Imoogi will disappear.

702
00:53:55,706 --> 00:53:58,405
Then everyone I love, my family, my friends,

703
00:53:58,806 --> 00:53:59,876
and you...

704
00:54:01,306 --> 00:54:03,575
won't get hurt.

705
00:54:08,186 --> 00:54:09,885
Don't think that ever again.

706
00:54:10,655 --> 00:54:11,885
But then again,

707
00:54:12,655 --> 00:54:13,925
how will you live,

708
00:54:14,695 --> 00:54:16,795
left all alone, if that happens?

709
00:54:19,795 --> 00:54:20,925
Then...

710
00:54:22,235 --> 00:54:24,735
I'd blame myself for a very long time...

711
00:54:26,505 --> 00:54:29,005
for failing to protect you again.

712
00:54:30,505 --> 00:54:31,905
I'd feel the same way.

713
00:54:33,775 --> 00:54:37,376
I don't think I can live a proper life without you anymore.

714
00:54:38,646 --> 00:54:42,316
So, we must protect each other.

715
00:54:43,316 --> 00:54:46,025
Let's not give Imoogi what he wants.

716
00:54:54,595 --> 00:54:55,695
Hi, Jae Hwan.

717
00:54:57,965 --> 00:54:59,135
What?

718
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:09,115
I told you not to come.

719
00:55:09,976 --> 00:55:11,075
Why did you come?

720
00:55:15,016 --> 00:55:18,226
Why are you here like this?

721
00:55:18,856 --> 00:55:19,956
Why?

722
00:55:19,956 --> 00:55:22,325
Don't touch me. You'll catch it.

723
00:55:41,775 --> 00:55:45,115
Let's never meet again. We don't like each other anyway.

724
00:55:53,286 --> 00:55:55,325
Who knew my last moment with you would end this way?

725
00:55:57,595 --> 00:56:00,295
I know. You should've died by my hands.

726
00:56:00,996 --> 00:56:04,336
Given what it is, do your best to survive.

727
00:56:04,536 --> 00:56:06,566
It looked like you finally made up with your brother.

728
00:56:06,635 --> 00:56:08,005
Can you handle the consequences?

729
00:56:08,405 --> 00:56:11,376
No. Yeon won't forgive me.

730
00:56:12,345 --> 00:56:14,106
I may never see him again.

731
00:56:15,416 --> 00:56:17,215
But it's better than him dying.

732
00:56:18,985 --> 00:56:20,115
Give it a rest.

733
00:56:20,786 --> 00:56:23,755
Melodramatic ones like you never meet a pretty end.

734
00:56:25,385 --> 00:56:26,985
The ground cherries are gone now.

735
00:56:27,155 --> 00:56:29,726
All I have left is this one human life.

736
00:56:29,726 --> 00:56:31,255
Don't jinx me.

737
00:56:31,496 --> 00:56:33,295
I'm going to spend everything I have before I die.

738
00:56:35,465 --> 00:56:36,595
Bye.

739
00:56:50,916 --> 00:56:52,316
You protect her.

740
00:56:52,916 --> 00:56:56,016
I'll free Yu Ri and save you.

741
00:56:58,463 --> 00:57:00,833
How could I not have recognized him?

742
00:57:01,094 --> 00:57:02,934
You have no idea...

743
00:57:04,103 --> 00:57:05,773
how harsh I've been to him.

744
00:57:05,934 --> 00:57:08,003
And you missing him dearly...

745
00:57:08,003 --> 00:57:09,503
must've led him here.

746
00:57:09,503 --> 00:57:10,673
But where does that get me?

747
00:57:11,103 --> 00:57:14,844
I finally found him but look at what's happening.

748
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:16,083
Unbelievable.

749
00:57:21,523 --> 00:57:22,954
Is this all a coincidence though?

750
00:57:23,684 --> 00:57:24,684
Sorry?

751
00:57:24,684 --> 00:57:26,853
Every fate entwined...

752
00:57:28,023 --> 00:57:30,123
with Yeon and Ji A's...

753
00:57:30,123 --> 00:57:31,764
is gathering in one place.

754
00:57:32,733 --> 00:57:36,364
The lover of his past life, her family, their friends,

755
00:57:36,704 --> 00:57:39,404
and their enemy.

756
00:57:43,873 --> 00:57:45,173
I'm scared.

757
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:47,673
I'm worried that...

758
00:57:49,414 --> 00:57:52,454
an event too devastating to bear is coming our way.

759
00:58:11,264 --> 00:58:13,773
You'll stay here with me for the time being.

760
00:58:16,603 --> 00:58:17,873
Get him to leave.

761
00:58:17,943 --> 00:58:19,914
You shouldn't be here. It's too dangerous.

762
00:58:19,914 --> 00:58:21,614
I would be sick by now if it were contagious.

763
00:58:22,114 --> 00:58:23,284
Or maybe I'm just in the pre-symptomatic stage.

764
00:58:23,284 --> 00:58:25,114
Will you just listen?

765
00:58:25,114 --> 00:58:28,014
There's no chance I'm leaving. I'll be here instead.

766
00:58:28,454 --> 00:58:29,483
You need someone to care for you.

767
00:58:30,224 --> 00:58:31,623
I'm going outside to talk.

768
00:58:32,054 --> 00:58:33,154
Look after her for me.

769
00:58:47,733 --> 00:58:48,773
What about Mr. Choi?

770
00:58:50,543 --> 00:58:53,914
He threw up an egg but still hasn't gotten any better.

771
00:58:54,943 --> 00:58:56,684
What on earth is that egg?

772
00:58:58,353 --> 00:59:00,284
It holds a baby snake.

773
00:59:00,914 --> 00:59:02,654
Apparently, it eats people from within.

774
00:59:04,724 --> 00:59:06,654
I can't watch her die like this.

775
00:59:07,923 --> 00:59:08,963
Never.

776
00:59:13,434 --> 00:59:15,063
It'll all be over soon.

777
00:59:16,804 --> 00:59:19,474
Once he takes the bait,

778
00:59:19,804 --> 00:59:20,934
I'll...

779
00:59:25,114 --> 00:59:27,844
So until then,

780
00:59:28,844 --> 00:59:30,483
stay patient for me.

781
00:59:37,554 --> 00:59:40,054
Let's join hands and kill the gatekeeper of Samdo River.

782
00:59:41,224 --> 00:59:42,594
Let me know if you change your mind.

783
00:59:43,094 --> 00:59:45,534
You have until the sun rises tomorrow morning.

784
01:00:35,313 --> 01:00:36,643
Take one more bite for me.

785
01:00:47,793 --> 01:00:48,864
I'm doomed.

786
01:00:51,963 --> 01:00:53,034
Sae Rom.

787
01:00:53,793 --> 01:00:55,304
- Sae Rom? - Sae Rom!

788
01:00:55,304 --> 01:00:56,304
Oh, no...

789
01:01:45,353 --> 01:01:47,853
I'm in. Together, we'll attack...

790
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:49,824
the gatekeeper of Samdo River.

791
01:02:21,253 --> 01:02:22,454
Yeon and Imoogi?

792
01:02:24,753 --> 01:02:25,824
You're joking, right?

793
01:02:27,423 --> 01:02:28,463
This can't be.

794
01:02:29,094 --> 01:02:30,123
Sorry?

795
01:02:30,264 --> 01:02:31,523
This is a suicide mission.

796
01:02:32,034 --> 01:02:35,864
Yeon's going to kill Imoogi and sacrifice his own life too.

797
01:02:38,364 --> 01:02:41,404
Yeon, you'll end up being caught...

798
01:02:41,404 --> 01:02:43,173
in the trap you set up yourself.

799
01:02:44,344 --> 01:02:47,713
And just like this, we will step on the same stage.

800
01:02:49,614 --> 01:02:53,414
A stage where one can never step down from...

801
01:02:54,554 --> 01:02:56,123
until the other dies.

802
01:03:13,273 --> 01:03:14,704
What are you doing here?

803
01:03:15,443 --> 01:03:17,244
You must die for me to live.

804
01:03:17,804 --> 01:03:19,474
I'll end this all myself.

805
01:03:20,543 --> 01:03:22,784
Don't do this. If you do...

806
01:03:23,184 --> 01:03:24,244
Farewell.

807
01:03:39,893 --> 01:03:41,494
The forecast never mentioned any rain.

808
01:04:11,693 --> 01:04:12,934
When did you get here?

809
01:04:14,293 --> 01:04:16,733
As soon as it started to rain which no one expected.

810
01:04:17,704 --> 01:04:18,904
Are you here to walk me home?

811
01:04:19,733 --> 01:04:21,173
It's best not to walk in the rain.

812
01:04:25,143 --> 01:04:26,813
What about work? Did you finish your daily task?

813
01:04:27,173 --> 01:04:30,284
I only needed to edit a few frames which I did at the speed of light.

814
01:04:30,443 --> 01:04:33,284
Who's this jerk that kept you from reuniting with your family?

815
01:04:33,313 --> 01:04:35,454
- Mr. Choi! - And me.

816
01:04:36,154 --> 01:04:38,284
- What? - I didn't bring my car today.

817
01:04:38,654 --> 01:04:40,293
So it seems. Did you walk here?

818
01:04:40,654 --> 01:04:42,724
It's only a 20-minute walk to your house.

819
01:04:43,193 --> 01:04:46,094
Now that your parents are here, we'll have less time to go out.

820
01:04:49,904 --> 01:04:52,434
Buy me ramyeon and I'll let you go free.

821
01:04:53,034 --> 01:04:54,103
Fine.

822
01:05:07,813 --> 01:05:08,923
One doesn't seem like enough.

823
01:05:08,923 --> 01:05:10,284
It isn't. It really isn't!

824
01:05:10,454 --> 01:05:12,094
I said we should buy two.

825
01:05:12,753 --> 01:05:14,554
Two things make ramyeon taste better.

826
01:05:14,554 --> 01:05:15,664
Do you know what they are?

827
01:05:15,664 --> 01:05:17,364
One's kimchi, so what's the other?

828
01:05:17,364 --> 01:05:18,994
The jerk who steals a bite!

829
01:05:21,063 --> 01:05:22,733
I'll make it even tastier then.

830
01:05:32,614 --> 01:05:34,114
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

831
01:05:35,483 --> 01:05:37,143
I should hold off on the broth.

832
01:05:37,813 --> 01:05:38,954
Why?

833
01:05:39,353 --> 01:05:40,654
I don't want to crave soju.

834
01:05:41,684 --> 01:05:43,123
How smart of you.

835
01:05:44,423 --> 01:05:47,753
When untangled, ramyeon noodles are at least 40m long.

836
01:05:48,154 --> 01:05:49,764
That's the height of a 13-story building.

837
01:05:49,963 --> 01:05:51,523
Since when did this turn into Trivia Night?

838
01:05:51,693 --> 01:05:54,764
I don't want even half of a noodle getting in between us.

839
01:05:56,233 --> 01:05:57,864
Who confesses their feelings with ramyeon noodles?

840
01:05:58,804 --> 01:06:00,804
Must you be so cute all the time?

841
01:06:01,034 --> 01:06:04,043
I've been known for that since my days as a mountain spirit.

842
01:06:12,784 --> 01:06:15,253
I haven't seen you this happy in a while.

843
01:06:16,123 --> 01:06:17,123
I am.

844
01:06:17,654 --> 01:06:20,454
My parents are waiting for me at home...

845
01:06:20,923 --> 01:06:22,563
and you're here by my side.

846
01:06:24,724 --> 01:06:26,764
My childhood dream has come true,

847
01:06:27,563 --> 01:06:30,434
so I wonder who can help make that happen for you too.

848
01:06:33,733 --> 01:06:37,404
I wonder how it feels to be human.

849
01:06:45,813 --> 01:06:49,054
I don't care if you're human or a nine-tailed fox.

850
01:06:50,083 --> 01:06:51,853
What matters is that we're together right now.

851
01:07:26,486 --> 01:07:29,355
(Tale of The Nine Tailed)

852
01:07:30,326 --> 01:07:33,225
If I don't stop this, she'll sacrifice herself...

853
01:07:33,225 --> 01:07:34,656
to protect me just like last time.

854
01:07:34,656 --> 01:07:35,725
Don't do it.

855
01:07:36,026 --> 01:07:38,166
You need to understand me.

856
01:07:38,496 --> 01:07:39,836
I'm going to wait for you...

857
01:07:39,836 --> 01:07:41,536
just like how you waited for me.

858
01:07:41,536 --> 01:07:42,906
This is the Underworld.

859
01:07:43,066 --> 01:07:45,036
The place where I'm standing right now.

860
01:07:45,236 --> 01:07:46,776
Do you even know what that means?

861
01:07:46,776 --> 01:07:49,246
If I fail, I want you to kill him instead.

862
01:07:49,246 --> 01:07:51,406
What if something happens to Yeon?

863
01:07:51,746 --> 01:07:54,616
- How could you... - Was this your plan all along?

864
01:07:55,045 --> 01:07:57,385
No. I can't do it.

865
01:07:57,385 --> 01:07:58,515
No!
