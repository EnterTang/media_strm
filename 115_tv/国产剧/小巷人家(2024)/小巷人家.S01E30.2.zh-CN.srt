00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,120
Hello, young E-mail!

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,960
S-s-super day! Innit, P-p-puffer Pete? 

26
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,960
You've got me down to a T, young earwig!

27
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,120
HUMMING

28
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,400
- Having a chug-wash? 
- Oh! 
- Don't forget to wash behind your gears!

29
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,640
Oh-ho-ho! You do make me laugh, you're so funny!

30
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,680
DING-DING-DONG!

31
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,600
Attention, Chuggers! Today a TV crew will be filming here!

32
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,000
Please just go about your business and be as helpful as possible!

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,840
WOW!!

34
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,240
Emery, you're a star in the making if ever I saw one.

35
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,520
- You must make sure they film you! 
- No, who'd want to watch me?

36
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,400
Oh-ho-ho, come on! You'll be perfect!

37
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,200
Emery, the crew need someone to show them around. I said you'd help them.

38
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,920
Wayhey! On my way, Vee!

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,000
HORN HONKS

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,600
Brewster, did you hear about the TV crew?

41
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,400
- Yeah! 
- With your brains and my good looks, we're gonna be famous!

42
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,120
Pfft! Yeah, right!

43
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,840
- Brewster? 
- Yes, Vee. 
- Emery is helping the TV crew today,

44
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,040
so I'd like you to fill in for him.

45
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,120
Cool! Today I'm a passenger train!

46
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,200
- I LOVE it! 

47
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:16,200
The cool buildings, the dramatic skyline, it's so...so...urban.

48
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,840
I'm Emery. I'll be your wheels today.

49
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,120
Mind the gap between the doors and the platform.

50
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,640
This chugger is ready to depart.

Chuggers! This city's beating heart, its pumping muscles!

Let's lift them out of their humdrum lives and make them,

54
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,720
for a nanosecond, EXTRAORDINARY!

55
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:43,880
Wow! Looks like Alwyn was right! I AM going to be on TV! I could be a star!

56
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,440
La-la-laaa! La la la la!

57
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,480
La-la-la-la...

58
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,520
STOP!

59
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,360
Look! An ordinary chugger, doing an everyday thing!

60
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,080
That's what we want!

61
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:07,480
La-la-laaa! La la la la! La la la la la laaa!

62
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,680
Choo-ch-ch-ch... Oh!

63
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,680
Hello!

64
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,360
Aaand cut!

65
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,680
I expect it'll be your turn next, Emery.

66
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,240
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

67
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,160
Mind your bumpers, coming through, ha-ha!

68
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,520
Oooh, gorgeous!

69
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,680
Aaaand action!

70
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,600
Aaaand cut!

71
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,960
Fabulous! Oh, he's cute!

72
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,160
- And so shiny! 
- Ha-ha-ha.

73
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,760
OK. Who's next?

74
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,240
I know...you!

75
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,680
I can't believe it! 

76
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,960
Who's the oldest chugger in town?

77
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,880
Yep! I'm 150 years young! So I could tell you a thing or two!

78
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,560
Did you know, that back in the glory days of steam, oh, we're going back

79
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,960
some time now, I was just a young, young chugger..

80
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,760
..and he'd say - that's Speedy McAllister,

81
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,360
the one I talked about. Or was it Cannonball Cooper?

82
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,840
- "Pete" he'd say, 
- DING-DING-DONG!

83
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,520
Puffer Pete to the rolling stock yard!

84
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,280
Message received and understood, Vee!

85
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,720
SNORING

86
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,400
- And cut! 
- Don't have to, the tape ran out 30 minutes ago.

87
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,720
OK! Now, let's hear from the young generation.

88
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,960
I'm young!

89
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,440
Yeah, you are!

90
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,960
So why don't you take me to meet some of your friends?

91
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,240
Ohhh!!

92
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,440
So yeah, there's always some stuff that needs to be fixed.

93
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,880
Because, you know, stuff breaks.

94
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,600
Huh? Aah!

95
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,120
LAUGHTER 

96
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,560
Ha-ha-ha-ha! Did we get that?

97
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,760
- Yeah. 
- Ha-ha-ha!

98
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,440
But I'M the funny one!

99
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,800
Time for one more shot, let's make it a good one.

100
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,080
I know! A passenger chugger!

101
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,040
My turn at LAST!

102
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,760
HORN TOOTS

103
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,240
- Good luck, Emery! 
- Thanks, Alwyn!

104
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,760
- Where do you want me? 
- Um, could you back up?

105
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,440
More.

106
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,680
More.

107
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,360
Perfect!

108
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,160
Wait there till we grab this last shot!

109
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,760
Huh?

110
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,120
Aaaand action!

111
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,600
But he's doing my job! I'm the passenger chugger!

112
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,880
Approaching platform! Preparing to stop!

113
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,720
Watch your step, please!

114
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,640
And cut!

115
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,440
Cool! When can we see it?

116
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,480
- There'll be a screening later. 
- Honking horns! I can't wait!

117
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,800
I'm gonna be a star!

118
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,320
You can come back now, um, what's his name again?

119
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,560
Invisible!

120
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,560
Fine! I know when I'm not wanted.

121
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,640
EMERY MUTTERS

122
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,720
We need something to tie it together.

123
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,920
- A presenter? 
- Oooh, I like! Who can we get?

124
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,760
We need someone fabulous, obviously. Talented, magnetic...

125
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,920
Not too magnetic, there's a lot of metal around here, ha-ha! 

126
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:23,360
And funny! You know who'd be perfect? Emm...emm...

127
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,040
emm...emm...

128
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,160
Emery?!

129
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,320
Action Chugger!

130
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,360
Huh?! 

131
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,640
I'm helpful, I'm strong, I get the job done!

132
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,440
Look out, film crew! Here I come!

133
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,120
Action Chugger, reporting for duty!

134
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,440
Mic him up!

135
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,880
BEEPING

136
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,920
There's a message coming through! A chugger's in distress!

137
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,560
Sorry! Gotta fly!

138
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,120
Someone needs ACTION CHUGGER!

139
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,800
He's number one! He's helpful, he's strong! Oops, hold on, he's gone!

140
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,800
- Ha-ha-ha! 
- Hey, who is this guy? He's funny!

141
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,160
Huh?

142
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,360
Think you could make more jokes?

143
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,640
- Does Puffer Pete talk a lot? 
- Ha-ha! Who needs Action Chugger?

144
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,120
We've got...Hilarious Emery!

145
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,120
Ha-ha! This'll be the funniest film ever!

146
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,320
HORN TOOTS

147
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,000
Special announcement!

148
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,520
This chugger is taking you on a tour of Chuggington!

149
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,400
ALL: YAAY! WOO! YAY!

150
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,240
This'll be good, Emery's so funny!

151
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,280
I always could spot talent!

152
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,360
Here we have Alwyn, a bit past her prime.

153
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,560
What's behind your gears, dear? You're covered with grime!

154
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,960
Oops! Pardon you!

155
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,000
Ha-ha-ha!

156
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,760
Oh! Well, really!

157
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:50,800
Now, we go to Hodge, Eddie's good mate. He's a bit clumsy, look out!

158
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,960
Oops! Too late!

159
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,240
I was just nervous because of the cameras!

160
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,840
I'm NOT clumsy!

161
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,080
- 'I'm 150 years young!' 
- The oldest chugger round here is Puffer Pete.

162
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,400
He talks so much, he can put you to sleep!

163
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,360
ALL: OOH!

164
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,840
I think I've seen enough!

165
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,240
It's time to leave Chuggington, so I'll take a bow.

166
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,080
My name is Emery, bye-bye for now!

167
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,440
YAAY!

168
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,160
Hooray! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

169
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,640
Huh? Why'd they all leave?

170
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,440
- I think you hurt their feelings. 
- But my jokes were really funny!

171
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
Now that I think about it, maybe you went too far.

172
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:38,200
Oh no! I didn't mean to! They're all my friends! What can I do?

173
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,880
I've got an idea - mic him up!

174
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,000
Special announcement!

175
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,520
EMERY'S HORN TOOTS

176
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,760
This chugger wants to apologise.

177
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,520
What I should have said was Alwyn is an engine with such style and grace

178
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,280
and Hodge always puts a smile on my face.

179
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,120
If you want a great story, give Puffer Pete a call.

180
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,680
Chuggington really is the best place of all.

181
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,120
I was trying to be funny, but my jokes went too far!

182
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,480
Having friends means much more than being a star.

183
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,200
Please forgive me.

184
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,440
Well, seeing as you put it so nicely, youngster...

185
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,200
..of course we will!

186
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,160
- Yeah! 
- That's more like it!

187
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,880
Be yourself! We think you're funny just the way you are!

188
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,240
Friends? 

189
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,280
ALL: FRIENDS!

190
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,640
And that's a wrap!

191
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,480
ALL: Ha-ha-ha-ha!

192
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,760
