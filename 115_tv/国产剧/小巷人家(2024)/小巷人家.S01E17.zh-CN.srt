1
00:00:04,721 --> 00:00:06,313
Aren't you both going?

2
00:00:06,489 --> 00:00:08,252
Spencer got tickets for me and Ezra.

3
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:12,156
Please, just don't go tonight, okay?
I have a bad feeling about this date.

4
00:00:12,328 --> 00:00:13,761
That feeling is jealousy.

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,626
They had a big opening
at the Philadelphia Art Museum.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,824
You went last night?

7
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:20,060
- Why is he out of jail?
- He's out on bail.

8
00:00:20,236 --> 00:00:23,797
Why don't you save us
the cost of a trial and drop dead?

9
00:00:23,973 --> 00:00:26,806
You'll have to do more
if you wanna become captain.

10
00:00:26,976 --> 00:00:28,967
Who said
I wanted to become captain?

11
00:00:29,145 --> 00:00:31,909
- What the hell?
- I take care of things myself.

12
00:00:32,082 --> 00:00:34,516
You remember
that phony your sister used to date?

13
00:00:34,718 --> 00:00:37,084
- Lan Thomas?
- We partied that whole summer.

14
00:00:37,253 --> 00:00:40,017
- He's the poster boy for preppy.
- Convincing, isn't he?

15
00:00:40,223 --> 00:00:44,319
- You wanna give it back to your teacher?
- What is that?

16
00:00:44,527 --> 00:00:46,358
Stopped Mrs. Montgomery
from getting to Philly.

17
00:00:46,596 --> 00:00:48,291
- Who's this from?
- Paige.

18
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,592
She's trying to bribe her way
to becoming captain.

19
00:00:50,767 --> 00:00:51,968
They're from the same place.

20
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:55,829
These two were purchased
by a Spencer Hastings.

21
00:00:56,673 --> 00:00:58,971
Does that help, dear?

22

23
00:01:18,795 --> 00:01:20,888
Ah, it's gonna be you
and your brother tonight.

24
00:01:21,064 --> 00:01:23,396
And, uh, he wants to order in
from Sausage Heaven.

25
00:01:23,566 --> 00:01:24,863
Again? Seriously?

26
00:01:25,034 --> 00:01:29,164
Dad, closest thing they have
to a vegetable is a paper plate.

27
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:32,137
Listen, just tell Mike
that it's your night to pick, okay?

28
00:01:32,308 --> 00:01:35,038
Okay. So you're
definitely not eating with us?

29
00:01:35,211 --> 00:01:37,338
Uh, no. No, I've got this thing.

30
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:42,247
Uh, and it's with the head of the
department, and dinner's included, so...

31
00:01:42,418 --> 00:01:45,410
- Have a great day, sweetheart.
- Okay.

32
00:01:45,588 --> 00:01:49,422
Oh, hey, Dad, I need your pledge
for the dance marathon.

33
00:01:49,592 --> 00:01:50,684
The deadline's today.

34
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:55,593
Oh, right. That's right. Uh,
my checkbook is in my jacket in the hall.

35
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:06,072
- Did you find it?
- What?

36
00:02:06,242 --> 00:02:07,402
Um...

37
00:02:07,577 --> 00:02:09,044
Yeah.

38
00:02:09,746 --> 00:02:13,443
- Great.
- Dad, what's this?

39
00:02:13,616 --> 00:02:17,848
Well, that's a ticket, uh, for the museum.

40
00:02:19,322 --> 00:02:21,085
Is it yours?

41
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:25,860
No, no, it's, uh... It's your mother's.

42
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:33,399
Uh, her car broke down, and she needed
to borrow mine to get there.

43
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:38,773
So she was at the museum
on Thursday night?

44
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:40,706
Yeah.

45
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,437
I mean, I think so.

46
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:49,809
Uh, you know, actually...

47
00:02:49,986 --> 00:02:53,319
...you should really
just, uh, talk to your Mom about that.

48
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:55,957
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

49
00:03:02,632 --> 00:03:04,930
Is my chemistry book over there?

50
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:07,501
Uh, I don't see it.

51
00:03:08,004 --> 00:03:10,973
It's probably in the room, Spence,
not the front yard.

52
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,576
What happened to the Cavanaughs'
mailbox? Somebody hit it?

53
00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:17,679
It's not the first time.
And I'm sure it wasn't an accident.

54
00:03:18,815 --> 00:03:22,410
Every time I come home, Toby's
out there cleaning up some new mess.

55
00:03:22,585 --> 00:03:26,817
- And please don't say he deserves it.
- I wasn't gonna say that.

56
00:03:30,326 --> 00:03:32,351
Is that it?

57
00:03:32,528 --> 00:03:34,496
Oh, thanks.

58
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,962
Do you still think
that somebody framed him?

59
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,161
Toby?

60
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:45,133
Do we really wanna have
this fight right now?

61
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,469
I have to save up my energy
for swim practice.

62
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,979
We're not on different sides
anymore, Em.

63
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:50,377
We're not on different sides
anymore, Em.

64
00:03:50,546 --> 00:03:53,174
I know what it feels like to have
somebody say you did something...

65
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:54,714
...when you know that you didn't.

66
00:03:54,918 --> 00:03:56,647
Are you talking about the bracelets?

67
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,480
I had never seen
that lady before...

68
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,556
...and yet she had my name
written down on two sales receipts.

69
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,987
We should go. We're gonna be late.

70
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,221
I owe you an apology.

71
00:04:08,431 --> 00:04:10,833
You believed that he was innocent
from day one...

72
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,499
...and I jumped down your throat.

73
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:18,573
I said some really heinous things
about Toby.

74
00:04:18,741 --> 00:04:22,541
You should apologize to him, not me.

75
00:04:47,003 --> 00:04:50,530
- Hey.
- Hey. Cute boots. New?

76
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,265
Hmm. Ish.

77
00:04:52,475 --> 00:04:53,669
What is with this line?

78
00:04:53,843 --> 00:04:55,868
Ugh, all the vending machines
are on lockdown.

79
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:59,242
Someone's been breaking into them
after hours and stealing food.

80
00:04:59,415 --> 00:05:01,906
I heard this one kid say
the alarm went off at 3 a.m.

81
00:05:02,085 --> 00:05:04,553
- The vending machines have alarms?
- The school.

82
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:08,885
Someone's been sneaking out of
the building in the middle of the night.

83
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:11,686
I mean, who'd wanna be here
any longer than they have to?

84
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:15,388
Hmm, well, I might.
Going home just got scary.

85
00:05:16,265 --> 00:05:18,893
This was in my Dad's coat.

86
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,296
He said it's my Mom's...

87
00:05:20,503 --> 00:05:23,267
...but I'm starting to wonder
if he was at the museum too.

88
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,236
Your dad? No, heh.

89
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,399
Why was he so twitchy when I asked?

90
00:05:28,378 --> 00:05:31,279
I mean, if they were there
at the same night as me and Ezra...

91
00:05:31,447 --> 00:05:32,914
Aria, you're just on a loop.

92
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:36,381
- It was a coincidence.
- Is it?

93
00:05:37,053 --> 00:05:38,543
You don't think it's weird...

94
00:05:38,721 --> 00:05:42,020
- ...that my mom had a ticket the same...
- Yes, a weird coincidence.

95
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:50,090
Um, can you get my coffee?
I'll be right back.

96
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,058
Um... Oh.

97
00:05:58,074 --> 00:05:59,098
We need to talk.

98
00:06:00,676 --> 00:06:03,304
You know that thing
you did with Mrs. Montgomery's car?

99
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:06,073
Well, just pretend
like it never happened, okay?

100
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:09,741
Don't talk about it, don't blog about it,
don't tweet about it. Clear?

101
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,477
Can I speak now?

102
00:06:11,654 --> 00:06:13,747
Okay, if you must,
but it's really annoying.

103
00:06:13,923 --> 00:06:17,256
- The way I see it, you owe me.
- For what?

104
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:21,693
For doing that thing that I can't talk,
blog, or tweet about.

105
00:07:33,336 --> 00:07:35,600
Was there a second watch?
Was anyone else keeping time?

106
00:07:35,805 --> 00:07:39,104
It was a tie, Paige.
You and Emily tied.

107
00:07:39,308 --> 00:07:41,435
So, what's gonna happen?
Who gets to anchor?

108
00:07:41,611 --> 00:07:43,169
Can't make that decision yet.

109
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:44,745
All right, listen up, Sharks.

110
00:07:44,914 --> 00:07:48,372
We'll meet tomorrow morning,
same place, same time...

111
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,712
...and have ourselves a little swim-off.

112
00:07:52,121 --> 00:07:54,385
So I guess
we'll just figure this out tomorrow.

113
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,889
You figure it out. I need to win.

114
00:08:01,364 --> 00:08:03,093
We should have met up earlier.

115
00:08:03,266 --> 00:08:04,290
Aria.

116
00:08:04,467 --> 00:08:06,094
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hey, Mom.

117
00:08:06,269 --> 00:08:09,033
- Your ears must've been burning.
- Why?

118
00:08:09,205 --> 00:08:12,936
I was just talking to the principal
about you and Mr. Fitz.

119
00:08:13,109 --> 00:08:14,633
Why?

120
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:18,774
Well, he wants to take your class to
New York to see the Fitzgerald show...

121
00:08:18,948 --> 00:08:21,280
...but the principal told him
there was no money.

122
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,613
- Do you wanna walk with me?
- Sure.

123
00:08:24,787 --> 00:08:26,448
What's up?

124
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:31,989
So Dad wrote me a check this morning
for the dance marathon.

125
00:08:32,161 --> 00:08:33,753
Okay.

126
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,795
And when I got to his checkbook...

127
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:38,798
...I found the ticket
that was yours to the museum.

128
00:08:38,968 --> 00:08:40,959
I guess it was in Dad's car.

129
00:08:41,137 --> 00:08:43,765
You didn't mention
you borrowed his car.

130
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,965
Oh, no, well, I didn't think I had to.

131
00:08:46,142 --> 00:08:48,975
Why, did you have it
on reserve for the night?

132
00:08:49,145 --> 00:08:52,945
No, I'm just confused.

133
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:57,142
Did you go to that exhibit or not?

134
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,788
Well, to be perfectly honest, no.

135
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:03,323
I skipped it, and I went out
to a really nice dinner instead.

136
00:09:03,492 --> 00:09:07,690
- By yourself?
- No, uh, I was with a friend.

137
00:09:07,897 --> 00:09:10,297
I gotta get to class.
I'll see you later.

138
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:23,305
Are you reading that fast
or fanning yourself?

139
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,707
What?

140
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,007
Um, sorry.

141
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,713
Where are you going?

142
00:09:33,923 --> 00:09:38,121
Um, I left my lip gloss in the history stack.
Gotta find it, heh.

143
00:09:44,967 --> 00:09:46,958
- What do you want?
- I'm calling in your debt.

144
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:50,631
Two losers just bailed on what they
owe me and I need some cash.

145
00:09:50,806 --> 00:09:53,400
So, what do you want me to do?
Bust their kneecaps?

146
00:09:53,576 --> 00:09:56,443
I don't want an enforcer. I want a date.

147
00:09:57,046 --> 00:09:58,843
Heh, okay, absolutely not.

148
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,074
You're the homecoming queen,
Hanna.

149
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,912
You got a rep around here.
I need to borrow some cred.

150
00:10:04,086 --> 00:10:07,817
- What are you gonna do with it?
- I need customers. With money.

151
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,651
Who need to know they can trust me.

152
00:10:09,825 --> 00:10:12,692
- Yeah, well, they can't.
- They can if I'm with you.

153
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,887
So you got a hot party
tomorrow night?

154
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:16,862
I have a swim meet.

155
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,664
You can fit all of that under a cap?

156
00:10:19,835 --> 00:10:21,427
Okay, I'm not swimming, freak.

157
00:10:21,604 --> 00:10:23,401
I'm cheering on a friend.

158
00:10:28,911 --> 00:10:30,902
Well, what is the point of a swim-off?

159
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,015
Why would the coach pit you
against each other before a meet?

160
00:10:34,183 --> 00:10:36,549
She's using our combined times
to choose anchor...

161
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,118
...and right now, we're tied.

162
00:10:38,287 --> 00:10:39,549
Well, you'll change that.

163
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,451
Maybe not. She wants it more.

164
00:10:41,624 --> 00:10:44,889
Emily, you want it more...

165
00:10:45,594 --> 00:10:47,562
...and it is okay to admit that.

166
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:54,469
You know who that's for, don't you?

167
00:10:54,637 --> 00:10:56,195
Toby?

168
00:11:02,144 --> 00:11:03,771
What are you doing?

169
00:11:03,946 --> 00:11:05,208
I might be interested.

170
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:07,941
- Spencer, don't. You can't.
- Why not?

171
00:11:08,117 --> 00:11:10,142
You'd be going there
for the wrong reason.

172
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:13,550
What if the same person
who gave my name to the bead lady...

173
00:11:13,723 --> 00:11:16,317
...is the one who framed Toby?
What if that was A?

174
00:11:16,525 --> 00:11:18,618
Can't you find that out
some other way?

175
00:11:18,794 --> 00:11:21,729
Who else knows what he knows?
If I can get him to talk then...

176
00:11:21,897 --> 00:11:24,730
You won't even get him to look at you.
He doesn't trust us.

177
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,492
He doesn't trust anyone anymore.

178
00:11:26,669 --> 00:11:29,832
Maybe, but if I have one piece
of the puzzle and he has another...

179
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:33,065
...then we can put it together
and maybe help each other.

180
00:11:50,192 --> 00:11:52,319
Hey. You're a little early.

181
00:11:52,495 --> 00:11:55,362
I just wanted to tell you
I'm not coming to practice today.

182
00:11:55,531 --> 00:11:58,364
- Why not?
- I have another commitment.

183
00:11:59,402 --> 00:12:01,267
Why don't you come in?
Close the door.

184
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:03,997
- I can't stay. I'm...
- No, come in.

185
00:12:11,947 --> 00:12:14,780
What are you trying to pull?
You gonna tell your parents...

186
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,384
...you can't stand me
so you're quitting the team?

187
00:12:17,553 --> 00:12:18,577
I'm not quitting.

188
00:12:18,754 --> 00:12:21,951
- I just have this other thing.
- Yeah, you can't avoid me.

189
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,286
- I live in your backyard.
- Well, this isn't about you. I'm...

190
00:12:25,461 --> 00:12:27,122
I'm too concentrated in athletics.

191
00:12:27,296 --> 00:12:29,457
It doesn't look good
on college applications.

192
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:32,190
So I just need to balance out
my schedule.

193
00:12:34,437 --> 00:12:35,631
- Knock, knock.
- Hey.

194
00:12:35,805 --> 00:12:37,739
Sorry to interrupt.

195
00:12:37,907 --> 00:12:41,035
- I thought you had a marketing seminar.
- Oh, the professor cancelled.

196
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:44,077
I brought the tile samples.
The contractor needs a decision.

197
00:12:44,246 --> 00:12:44,513
- Oh, great.
- Bye.

198
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,572
- Oh, great.
- Bye.

199
00:12:46,749 --> 00:12:49,240
- I think your sister's quitting the team.
- Why?

200
00:12:49,418 --> 00:12:52,114
I'm not quitting the team.
I'm just doing some tutoring.

201
00:12:53,556 --> 00:12:56,957
- Well, anyone in particular?
- Toby Cavanaugh.

202
00:12:57,126 --> 00:12:58,252
- What?
- What?

203
00:12:58,427 --> 00:13:00,292
I signed up to help him
with his French.

204
00:13:00,463 --> 00:13:02,954
I can't believe the school would
let anyone near him.

205
00:13:03,566 --> 00:13:06,262
- Why are you doing this?
- I already told you.

206
00:13:06,435 --> 00:13:10,428
Uh, what is this really about? That kid
murdered one of your best friends.

207
00:13:10,606 --> 00:13:13,166
Don't tell me you're falling
for that martyr crap.

208
00:13:13,342 --> 00:13:15,333
You can't believe
a thing that creep says.

209
00:13:15,511 --> 00:13:18,708
Well, Toby Cavanaugh
hasn't cornered the market on lying.

210
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:23,714
I better go.

211
00:13:51,981 --> 00:13:53,107
Hi.

212
00:13:53,282 --> 00:13:57,116
I noticed this was on the ground
as I was walking up.

213
00:14:02,191 --> 00:14:05,126
Wait. I'm here to tutor you.

214
00:14:06,495 --> 00:14:09,623
Someone from the school
called to tell you, didn't they?

215
00:14:16,472 --> 00:14:20,135
- Why you?
- Because I'm an AP French.

216
00:14:21,176 --> 00:14:22,575
And I volunteered.

217
00:14:23,312 --> 00:14:25,143
I have all your assignments together.

218
00:14:25,314 --> 00:14:26,781
I worked out a schedule
for the rest of the semester.

219
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,710
If we meet for three times a week,
we can...

220
00:14:33,522 --> 00:14:36,355
Here. You can't come in.

221
00:14:36,926 --> 00:14:39,986
- Jenna's home.
- Okay.

222
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:42,690
Well, is there somewhere else
we can go?

223
00:14:43,499 --> 00:14:46,059
I can't go somewhere else.

224
00:14:47,403 --> 00:14:50,429
Well, will Jenna mind
if we sit out here on the porch?

225
00:14:58,614 --> 00:15:00,673
Don't think about it.
It'll make you crazy.

226
00:15:00,849 --> 00:15:03,784
How am I supposed
to not think about it? It's too freaky.

227
00:15:03,953 --> 00:15:06,547
- Lf my Mom's car hadn't stalled...
- Well, it did.

228
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:09,419
Don't look a gift card in the mouth.

229
00:15:09,592 --> 00:15:11,025
The universe gave you a pass.

230
00:15:11,193 --> 00:15:14,026
Hmm. That's not the universe I know.

231
00:15:14,196 --> 00:15:16,926
Look, it all worked out, okay?
And that's what counts.

232
00:15:17,099 --> 00:15:20,125
Maybe the universe got a little help
from someone.

233
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,499
- Someone with really good intentions.
- Shh.

234
00:15:25,374 --> 00:15:27,604
That's great. I can pick you up.

235
00:15:27,776 --> 00:15:31,075
I can find you in the dark.
I've done it before, heh.

236
00:15:31,246 --> 00:15:33,180
Okay, I'll see you soon. Bye.

237
00:15:35,117 --> 00:15:38,780
Hey. So you're not going to
that department dinner anymore?

238
00:15:38,954 --> 00:15:41,320
Oh, no. No.

239
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,617
Was that Mom you were talking to?

240
00:15:43,792 --> 00:15:45,623
Uh, no, no, no, it wasn't.

241
00:15:45,794 --> 00:15:49,560
Uh, so you sure you guys
are gonna be okay here alone tonight?

242
00:15:49,732 --> 00:15:52,064
- Sure.
- Okay.

243
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,573
Okay, look, Aria,
even if it wasn't the universe...

244
00:15:58,741 --> 00:15:59,765
Shh.

245
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,474
I'm just saying if it's not a coincidence,
then maybe...

246
00:16:04,647 --> 00:16:06,512
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

247
00:16:06,682 --> 00:16:08,013
- To follow my dad.
- Where?

248
00:16:08,183 --> 00:16:10,515
- Lf I knew, we wouldn't have to.
- Aria...

249
00:16:10,753 --> 00:16:14,484
Han, my Dad's about to have dinner
with somebody in the dark. Move it.

250
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:22,587
I, uh...

251
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:25,766
I brought you something.

252
00:16:29,838 --> 00:16:31,465
L'Attrape-Coeurs.

253
00:16:32,975 --> 00:16:34,943
The Heart Catcher?

254
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,044
It's Catcher in the Rye.

255
00:16:37,212 --> 00:16:39,680
I guess there's no literal translation.

256
00:16:39,848 --> 00:16:43,340
But it helps to read a book
that you already know in English.

257
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,318
How do you know I've read it?

258
00:16:45,521 --> 00:16:47,716
I saw you once...

259
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:51,220
...at the Apple Rose Grille.
You were reading it.

260
00:16:53,295 --> 00:16:55,024
What are you doing here?

261
00:16:56,331 --> 00:16:59,357
Uh, Mr. Carinci wants you
to review the conditional tense.

262
00:16:59,535 --> 00:17:02,299
- And the workbook has...
- What do you want?

263
00:17:02,504 --> 00:17:04,665
What makes you think
that I want something?

264
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,638
Because you never do anything
without a reason.

265
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,243
Did Emily tell you that?

266
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,879
Nobody had to tell me that.

267
00:17:17,186 --> 00:17:20,212
I think maybe you're being framed.

268
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,157
What changed your mind?

269
00:17:23,358 --> 00:17:26,691
I think somebody might be trying
to do the same thing to me.

270
00:17:26,862 --> 00:17:28,261
Maybe the same person.

271
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,488
How's that feel?

272
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,690
Not good.

273
00:17:32,868 --> 00:17:34,335
Scary.

274
00:17:35,671 --> 00:17:39,163
Why would somebody go after you?

275
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:42,035
What makes you so important?

276
00:17:43,545 --> 00:17:45,479
I don't know.

277
00:17:47,282 --> 00:17:50,615
Maybe you know something
you're not supposed to know.

278
00:17:51,553 --> 00:17:53,384
Every time I think I know something...

279
00:17:53,555 --> 00:17:56,547
...I get the rug pulled out from under me
and I end up on my ass.

280
00:18:04,266 --> 00:18:06,097
I'm sorry...

281
00:18:07,035 --> 00:18:08,969
...for what I said about you...

282
00:18:09,138 --> 00:18:11,106
...and what I thought.

283
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:19,604
The sweater with Alison's blood...

284
00:18:19,815 --> 00:18:22,875
...you said that you gave it to her
that night?

285
00:18:23,552 --> 00:18:25,042
I did.

286
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,780
And then she got into a car.

287
00:18:27,956 --> 00:18:31,289
With some guy,
I couldn't see who it was.

288
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,621
I'm not supposed to talk about this.

289
00:18:33,796 --> 00:18:37,095
Do you know how the sweater
could've gotten back into your house?

290
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:44,734
Uh, I have to go.

291
00:18:45,474 --> 00:18:47,942
- Oh.
- Thanks. For the book.

292
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,941
Yeah, you're welcome.

293
00:19:06,495 --> 00:19:10,022
What are your thoughts
on genetic modification?

294
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:12,990
Aren't scientists playing God?

295
00:19:13,168 --> 00:19:15,830
And how will it affect human health
in the long term?

296
00:19:16,505 --> 00:19:18,029
So I'm against it.

297
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,975
He's different.

298
00:19:21,443 --> 00:19:23,434
- How?
- I meant...

299
00:19:23,612 --> 00:19:26,342
...he's different
than I thought he would be.

300
00:19:29,051 --> 00:19:32,612
"How have humans altered the genomes
of species for thousands of years?"

301
00:19:32,788 --> 00:19:35,348
Through artificial selection.

302
00:19:35,524 --> 00:19:37,924
There's something about him that's...

303
00:19:38,694 --> 00:19:39,991
I don't know.

304
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:44,729
Wow. A question Spencer Hastings
can't answer.

305
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,163
Interesting.

306
00:19:47,369 --> 00:19:49,837
It's not that interesting.

307
00:19:50,706 --> 00:19:53,732
- Am I finished with your homework?
- You are.

308
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,705
Thank you.

309
00:19:58,747 --> 00:20:01,079
I keep trying to find a connection.

310
00:20:02,184 --> 00:20:03,344
To Toby?

311
00:20:04,219 --> 00:20:06,483
To Alison and Toby.

312
00:20:06,655 --> 00:20:07,713
Me and Toby.

313
00:20:09,858 --> 00:20:12,190
We're pretty sure
he didn't do it, right?

314
00:20:12,361 --> 00:20:15,353
And yet somebody found a way
to make him look extremely guilty.

315
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:19,967
Spence, you can't figure all that out
sitting on his porch, conjugating verbs.

316
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:23,269
Well, you don't know
what those verbs are.

317
00:20:24,273 --> 00:20:27,709
If he didn't tell you the first time,
he probably can't.

318
00:20:29,077 --> 00:20:31,773
Are you sure
he even wants you to come back?

319
00:20:32,681 --> 00:20:34,239
Yeah.

320
00:20:34,783 --> 00:20:36,614
I think he does.

321
00:20:54,102 --> 00:20:57,367
Why is my dad
walking into our high school?

322
00:20:57,739 --> 00:20:59,604
Okay, weird.

323
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,208
Not really.

324
00:21:01,376 --> 00:21:04,470
Think about it. He's probably
just going to see your mom.

325
00:21:04,646 --> 00:21:05,977
Eh, that's ridiculous.

326
00:21:06,148 --> 00:21:08,378
People lie, Aria.

327
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,778
I mean, hello.

328
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,381
Okay, what are they doing?

329
00:21:14,957 --> 00:21:16,891
- Call your mother.
- Huh?

330
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:19,527
Right now. Call your mom.

331
00:21:23,098 --> 00:21:26,932
ELLA Hi, Aria,
honey. I was just thinking about you.

332
00:21:27,102 --> 00:21:29,832
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

333
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,562
Why wouldn't it be okay?

334
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,231
Uh, I didn't mean to suggest
that everything wasn't okay.

335
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:37,173
I was just, you know,
asking, checking, wondering...

336
00:21:37,346 --> 00:21:38,745
...like moms do.

337
00:21:38,914 --> 00:21:40,245
Where are you?

338
00:21:41,616 --> 00:21:42,640
Home.

339
00:21:42,818 --> 00:21:43,842
Shh. Shh. Shh.

340
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:45,043
Where are you?

341
00:21:46,188 --> 00:21:47,416
Home.

342
00:21:47,622 --> 00:21:50,090
Okay, so everything's okay, then?

343
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:53,821
- Yeah.
- Okay, I'll talk to you later, sweetie. Bye.

344
00:21:53,996 --> 00:21:55,020
ARIA
Bye.

345
00:21:56,965 --> 00:21:59,126
Okay, well, she says she's home.

346
00:21:59,301 --> 00:22:01,326
Do you believe her?

347
00:22:03,338 --> 00:22:04,362
I don't know.

348
00:22:09,177 --> 00:22:11,236
Okay, what are you doing?

349
00:22:31,199 --> 00:22:33,167
Tsk, that's not good.

350
00:22:33,335 --> 00:22:36,998
- Mm. What? You used to like it.
- No, no, not that, this.

351
00:22:37,172 --> 00:22:40,573
The lying, the sneaking around.
I feel like a teenager.

352
00:22:40,742 --> 00:22:43,006
Yeah, it's fun, isn't it?

353
00:22:47,015 --> 00:22:49,040
Listen, we should just tell the kids.

354
00:22:49,217 --> 00:22:54,052
We can't. We can't tell them
until we know what this is.

355
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:58,153
Ugh, okay, I think I got everything.
Let's go.

356
00:22:58,693 --> 00:23:00,524
Watch out for that.

357
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,329
Oh, my God, my parents are having
an affair with each other.

358
00:23:34,596 --> 00:23:35,620
Hanna.

359
00:23:35,797 --> 00:23:37,424
Hanna.

360
00:23:38,433 --> 00:23:40,924
- What are you doing?
- Come up here.

361
00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:43,030
Hurry.

362
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:47,368
What are you looking at?

363
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,141
This.

364
00:23:50,312 --> 00:23:53,577
Someone sending a bunch of texts?
Spencer's laptop disappearing?

365
00:23:53,748 --> 00:23:57,081
Our lockers broken into?
I mean, all this stuff happens at school.

366
00:23:57,252 --> 00:23:59,186
This is A.

367
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,815
Let's just get out of here. Come on.

368
00:24:13,435 --> 00:24:16,962
- Hanna, you're taking that?
- Yes. A owes me.

369
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:21,642
Hospital bills. Pain and suffering.
Tire marks on my cleavage.

370
00:24:25,247 --> 00:24:27,442
It's nothing.
The lights are probably on a timer.

371
00:24:33,588 --> 00:24:35,579
We should go.

372
00:24:44,099 --> 00:24:46,090
Come on.

373
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,084
Caleb?

374
00:25:14,329 --> 00:25:17,093
How's your eye? Any better?

375
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:20,359
Still burning. Ugh, you want a sharp stick
for the other one?

376
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:23,663
Hey, you know what?
It was just hair spray. It was light hold.

377
00:25:23,838 --> 00:25:25,465
What were you doing in there?

378
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,437
I'm sort of, um...

379
00:25:28,076 --> 00:25:29,134
I'm crashing here.

380
00:25:29,311 --> 00:25:31,802
- You are? Why?
- What do you care?

381
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,278
Don't snap at her like that.
I have more.

382
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:37,885
Fire away.
Just give me my money back first.

383
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,849
I mean,
where do your parents think you are?

384
00:25:42,224 --> 00:25:45,819
My foster parents don't care where I am
as long as they keep getting their checks.

385
00:25:45,994 --> 00:25:49,486
Wait, I thought all that stuff
about the social worker was a joke.

386
00:25:49,664 --> 00:25:52,963
Believe me,
my social worker is a joke...

387
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,465
...but, yeah, I do have one.

388
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:57,662
This is crazy.
You can't keep staying here.

389
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:00,034
Why? There's hot water,
vending machines...

390
00:26:00,208 --> 00:26:02,073
...the principal's couch
is comfortable.

391
00:26:02,244 --> 00:26:03,836
Well, they know
someone was here last night.

392
00:26:05,513 --> 00:26:07,003
Hmm, yeah.

393
00:26:07,182 --> 00:26:08,410
I got sloppy.

394
00:26:09,017 --> 00:26:13,147
- Where are you going?
- Grab some dinner, then back to bed.

395
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:17,051
You know your way out, right?

396
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,524
Paige?

397
00:26:51,259 --> 00:26:53,284
Are you okay?

398
00:26:53,595 --> 00:26:54,721
No.

399
00:26:55,297 --> 00:26:56,764
What happened?

400
00:26:58,667 --> 00:27:01,659
You have every reason to hate me.

401
00:27:02,437 --> 00:27:04,598
I don't even know why I'm here.

402
00:27:05,674 --> 00:27:07,403
I don't hate you.

403
00:27:07,575 --> 00:27:09,270
I would.

404
00:27:09,744 --> 00:27:11,405
I do.

405
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,971
Don't say that.

406
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:18,108
I'm sorry, Emily.

407
00:27:19,954 --> 00:27:21,922
I just wanted you to know that.

408
00:27:25,827 --> 00:27:26,885
Wait, Paige.

409
00:27:39,341 --> 00:27:41,502
Morning, Sharks.
How we all doing today?

410
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:45,407
- Ready to swim, coach.
- I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

411
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,445
SWIMMERS
Ready to swim, coach!

412
00:27:47,615 --> 00:27:49,480
That's what I'm talking about.

413
00:27:49,651 --> 00:27:52,449
It's our last practice before
this afternoon's big meet...

414
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,110
...so let's make it a good one.

415
00:27:54,289 --> 00:27:56,120
Emily, there's not gonna be
a swim-off.

416
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:58,987
I just got word
that Paige will not be joining us.

417
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,923
- Why not?
- She had an accident...

418
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,030
...while riding her bike last night.

419
00:28:03,231 --> 00:28:04,664
She's just a little banged-up.

420
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:06,824
She'll be back swimming in no time.

421
00:28:07,001 --> 00:28:10,664
Okay, ladies, in the water, in the water.
Come on.

422
00:28:17,879 --> 00:28:19,642
You're late. Let's go in.

423
00:28:19,814 --> 00:28:21,645
Wait. Can we talk about last night?

424
00:28:21,816 --> 00:28:23,147
What is there to talk about?

425
00:28:23,318 --> 00:28:26,651
Uh, the fact that you're hiding out
in the AV closet until graduation.

426
00:28:26,821 --> 00:28:27,845
What's your plan?

427
00:28:28,022 --> 00:28:31,514
Do you wanna play guidance counselor
or do you wanna pay off your debt?

428
00:28:31,693 --> 00:28:33,160
I'm cashing in on that favor.

429
00:28:33,995 --> 00:28:36,361
Point out the kids
who have money to burn.

430
00:28:36,564 --> 00:28:39,863
Fine. I'll trade you.
One name for one answer.

431
00:28:42,036 --> 00:28:43,697
- Oh, hey, Bridget.
- Hey, Hanna.

432
00:28:43,872 --> 00:28:47,205
- You know my friend Caleb, right?
- Sort of.

433
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:48,706
Hey.

434
00:28:51,212 --> 00:28:52,474
Bridget Wu.

435
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:54,171
Total party girl.

436
00:28:54,349 --> 00:28:57,682
Bring her a bottle of something strong
and she's your new best friend.

437
00:28:57,852 --> 00:28:59,479
Where are you from?

438
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,588
- A lot of places.
- Okay, I gave details.

439
00:29:03,758 --> 00:29:08,388
Seattle, Salt Lake, Denver,
Chicago and here. Your turn.

440
00:29:10,899 --> 00:29:13,891
Lindsey Hoover.
Don't let the Jesus sandals fool you.

441
00:29:14,068 --> 00:29:15,262
She's got cash.

442
00:29:15,437 --> 00:29:18,895
- Her grandfather invented the stapler.
- Nice.

443
00:29:19,073 --> 00:29:20,700
Wanna get tight with her?

444
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:23,810
Grow a hipster stache
and start talking about the Man.

445
00:29:24,612 --> 00:29:26,944
Why don't you report
your foster parents?

446
00:29:27,115 --> 00:29:29,413
To who? My social worker?

447
00:29:29,584 --> 00:29:31,518
I've had four in the last six months.

448
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,119
They can't remember my name.

449
00:29:33,321 --> 00:29:34,845
The last one called me Calvin.

450
00:29:36,891 --> 00:29:39,553
When's the last time
you saw your real parents?

451
00:29:41,563 --> 00:29:44,828
It's gonna take a lot more than names
to hear about them.

452
00:30:03,952 --> 00:30:06,147
Truce. Got you a button.

453
00:30:06,354 --> 00:30:08,720
- Thanks.
- No problem.

454
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:12,053
I need to be super rah-rah.
Now that I'm the coach's wife, heh.

455
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,457
It's a swim meet.
It's not even his sport.

456
00:30:14,629 --> 00:30:17,928
Well, what's yours,
brother-in-law bashing?

457
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:21,899
- What's going on between you and lan?
- Why don't you ask him?

458
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,731
Something wrong with that picture?

459
00:30:28,142 --> 00:30:30,940
I see my husband buying us hot dogs.

460
00:30:31,112 --> 00:30:34,240
And I see you going out of your way
to humiliate him.

461
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:35,905
What was that lying crack about?

462
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,985
He does nothing but try.
When are you gonna give him a break?

463
00:30:39,153 --> 00:30:41,951
When I figure out
why he rushed back to Rosewood...

464
00:30:42,123 --> 00:30:45,524
- ...and rushed into proposing to you.
- You've got it wrong. I proposed.

465
00:30:45,693 --> 00:30:46,751
I wanted to elope.

466
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:50,022
You have a problem with my marriage,
take it up with me, not him.

467
00:30:50,198 --> 00:30:51,688
Well, him is the problem.

468
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,097
He's not been entirely honest with you.
And I am worried about you.

469
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,669
About what?

470
00:30:58,172 --> 00:31:00,003
You have to ask him about Alison.

471
00:31:00,174 --> 00:31:02,165
About what happened the summer
that she was killed.

472
00:31:02,343 --> 00:31:04,777
Heh, you really are too much.

473
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,107
Did Toby Cavanaugh
put that idea in your head?

474
00:31:08,683 --> 00:31:12,642
Hey. Sorry I took so long, they were
out of the, uh, spicy mustard you like.

475
00:31:16,824 --> 00:31:21,454
- Did I miss something, or...?
- No. We were just talking about Alison.

476
00:31:23,031 --> 00:31:25,499
Lan, I'll meet you inside.

477
00:31:26,334 --> 00:31:28,165
Okay.

478
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:34,408
Look. I already lost one relationship
because of you.

479
00:31:34,576 --> 00:31:37,044
You will not ruin my marriage too.

480
00:31:37,211 --> 00:31:39,304
- Melissa?
- Coming.

481
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,425
When's Emily gonna jump in?

482
00:32:00,602 --> 00:32:03,730
She's the anchor. She swims last
because she's the fastest.

483
00:32:04,372 --> 00:32:07,000
Remind me. Which one's Lindsay
and which one's Bridget.

484
00:32:08,276 --> 00:32:10,608
Bridget's the one
drinking from her purse.

485
00:32:14,048 --> 00:32:16,448
Thanks. I'll be right back.

486
00:32:16,618 --> 00:32:18,518
Come on, come on, come on!

487
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:20,119
Why are we sitting with Caleb?

488
00:32:20,788 --> 00:32:21,846
Why not?

489
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,924
Hanna, I like stray dogs too,
but sometimes they bite.

490
00:32:25,093 --> 00:32:26,958
Okay, well he's had his shots.

491
00:32:27,128 --> 00:32:30,620
- Go, Emily!
- She's not swimming yet.

492
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,562
Come on.

493
00:33:19,847 --> 00:33:22,338
Go, Emily! Go!

494
00:34:21,275 --> 00:34:24,972
Um, you know what?
I'm gonna take the long way home.

495
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,977
- Okay, I'll see you later.
- Okay.

496
00:34:58,146 --> 00:34:59,477
What's this?

497
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,945
My eviction notice.

498
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,584
I'm sorry.

499
00:35:06,053 --> 00:35:09,648
- You know that I didn't tell anyone...
- I didn't go there.

500
00:35:10,825 --> 00:35:12,725
Well, maybe it's for the best.

501
00:35:12,894 --> 00:35:15,488
I mean, the place had small closets.

502
00:35:16,998 --> 00:35:18,465
Hated that shirt, anyway.

503
00:35:24,972 --> 00:35:28,032
Consider your debt paid.
Have a good day.

504
00:35:28,242 --> 00:35:31,678
- Hey, if you need a place to stay...
- No, thanks.

505
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,443
Your mom starts asking questions,
someone calls Social Services...

506
00:35:35,616 --> 00:35:37,709
...and it's just... It's a big mess, heh.

507
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,580
Wait.

508
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:46,686
There's an old couch in my basement.

509
00:35:47,295 --> 00:35:49,286
My mom will never know.

510
00:35:59,373 --> 00:36:00,397
Hanna.

511
00:36:01,008 --> 00:36:03,238
Hey. God, here you are.

512
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,902
You're not gonna believe
what the sick freak did now.

513
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,741
- What are you talking about?
- Look.

514
00:36:08,216 --> 00:36:11,276
I have to say, A is smart
trying to pit us against each other.

515
00:36:11,452 --> 00:36:14,319
- Yeah, Aria, um, you know l...
- I mean, it's relentless.

516
00:36:14,522 --> 00:36:17,821
Every time we shut a door,
A kicks open a window.

517
00:36:18,025 --> 00:36:21,153
- I don't even know...
- I gave your Mom the museum ticket.

518
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,391
What?

519
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:28,567
- Why would you do that?
- A made me do it.

520
00:36:28,736 --> 00:36:30,761
A has something on me and l...

521
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:33,771
A has something on all of us, Hanna...

522
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:36,842
...but there's nothing
that A would threaten me with...

523
00:36:37,044 --> 00:36:39,911
...that would make me do that to you.
You're my best friend.

524
00:36:40,081 --> 00:36:43,778
I know, and as soon as I put that ticket
in your mom's mailbox...

525
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:46,283
...I did everything I could to undo it.

526
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:50,082
- The reason your Mom didn't get to the...
- Stop talking.

527
00:36:51,692 --> 00:36:56,129
There's nothing you could say that
would change the way I feel right now.

528
00:37:04,372 --> 00:37:05,430
You okay?

529
00:37:06,574 --> 00:37:08,838
You didn't return any of my calls.

530
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:10,773
I'm fine.

531
00:37:11,279 --> 00:37:13,076
It's nothing.

532
00:37:16,017 --> 00:37:17,609
I didn't know what to say.

533
00:37:18,786 --> 00:37:22,153
I was riding home on my bike
and totally wiped out.

534
00:37:22,356 --> 00:37:24,153
What were you thinking about?

535
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:27,658
How easy things would be
if I wiped out.

536
00:37:29,964 --> 00:37:31,659
I'm kind of done with swimming.

537
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,325
Yeah, I used to feel that way.

538
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,800
Obviously, you got over it.

539
00:37:40,107 --> 00:37:42,132
How did you get over it?

540
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,679
I started swimming for myself.

541
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:45,168
I started swimming for myself.

542
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:50,613
I quit trying be better than everyone
on the team and I just relaxed.

543
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:53,050
Sounds fun.

544
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:00,493
When's the last time
you swam for fun?

545
00:39:14,235 --> 00:39:15,259
- Hey.
- Hi.

546
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:18,564
I got your message,
but I didn't totally understand.

547
00:39:18,739 --> 00:39:21,435
This isn't going to work. Here.

548
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,668
Take it back.

549
00:39:24,845 --> 00:39:27,837
I came here because I thought
that we could help each other.

550
00:39:29,083 --> 00:39:30,744
We can't.

551
00:39:30,985 --> 00:39:32,714
Just take it and go.

552
00:40:08,522 --> 00:40:11,582
- Question.
- What's up?

553
00:40:11,759 --> 00:40:13,226
Um, the towels in the bathroom?

554
00:40:13,394 --> 00:40:16,192
Are they like, the fancy
people-are-coming-over towels?

555
00:40:17,064 --> 00:40:18,964
No, you can use them.

556
00:40:19,133 --> 00:40:22,728
I don't have to.
I can shake off and air dry.

557
00:40:22,903 --> 00:40:24,302
Please don't.

558
00:40:28,709 --> 00:40:30,006
What's going on?

559
00:40:32,279 --> 00:40:34,144
You want me to leave?

560
00:40:34,882 --> 00:40:36,873
It's not about you.

561
00:40:38,285 --> 00:40:40,549
Aria's really...

562
00:40:40,721 --> 00:40:43,019
...really mad at me.

563
00:40:44,425 --> 00:40:47,394
You know that thing
I told you not to leak?

564
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:51,562
She found out anyway?

565
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:56,332
She's never gonna speak to me again.

566
00:40:59,607 --> 00:41:03,566
You don't have to sit here and listen
to this. Just go take your shower.

567
00:41:20,928 --> 00:41:22,589
It can wait.

568
00:41:34,542 --> 00:41:37,033
- Good night.
- Wait, Spencer.

569
00:41:37,211 --> 00:41:40,203
- Can we talk? About earlier?
- No.

570
00:41:40,781 --> 00:41:42,442
It's late and I'm tired.

571
00:41:42,616 --> 00:41:44,277
I know about you and lan.

572
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:50,720
He told me everything. The thing
you two had when we were broken up.

573
00:41:50,891 --> 00:41:52,381
I can't hold that against you.

574
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,824
Did he tell you anything else
about that summer?

575
00:41:54,995 --> 00:41:57,657
Whatever it is you're holding onto,
it's got to stop.

576
00:41:57,865 --> 00:42:00,493
- I think he's dangerous.
- And I think you need help.

577
00:42:00,668 --> 00:42:02,966
You keep wanting what I have.

578
00:42:03,137 --> 00:42:07,733
- You know what, Melissa? It was...
- Spencer, I don't want to fight.

579
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:11,275
I realize I lost my temper earlier
and I'm sorry.

580
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:14,505
I've been
a little hormonal lately and...

581
00:42:14,682 --> 00:42:17,310
I guess I should tell you...

582
00:42:17,918 --> 00:42:19,317
Tell me what?

583
00:42:21,689 --> 00:42:23,316
We're pregnant.

584
00:42:27,194 --> 00:42:30,095
This is where you say
congratulations.

585
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:36,034
Good night, sis.

586
00:43:01,262 --> 00:43:03,594
MAN
Learning French can be a fun activity...

587
00:43:03,764 --> 00:43:06,289
...for families, friends,
civic groups or clubs.

588
00:43:06,467 --> 00:43:09,459
By listening to these long-playing,
hi-fidelity records...

589
00:43:09,637 --> 00:43:12,902
...you can speak fluently
in as little as six weeks.

590
00:43:13,073 --> 00:43:17,407
We're going to start with the French
verb etre, which means "to be".

591
00:43:17,578 --> 00:43:19,546
Ready? Let's begin.

592
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:24,810
I am.

593
00:43:26,253 --> 00:43:27,481
I am.

594
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:29,948
I am.

595
