1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,640
We can laugh ha-ha We can sing la-la-la-la

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,040
We can make anything

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,240
Hold my hand

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,200
Make a magical land

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,560
When letters get together we go alakazam

6
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,320
We can run, we can slide We can hide in a box

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,760
Are you ready for some fun with the Alphablocks?

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,120
Alphablocks! 

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,080
WHISTLING

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,320
- Arrr!  - Why do you always say, "Arrr!"?

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,600
Because I'm a pirate.

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,440
What's a pirate?

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,720
I am.

14
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,440
- Why?  - Because I do piratey things.

15
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,680
Like what?

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,720
Er....

17
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,080
I've got a hat

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,240
And I say, "Arrr!" a lot.

19
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,560
And that's what pirates do?

20
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,000
I think so.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,560
Fast!

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,680
Aaah!

23
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,000
Mm. Ah. P.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,280
Map!

25
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,120
T... T...

26
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,640
A treasure map.

27
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,120
Arrr!

28
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,800
We found a treasure map.

29
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,440
Will you lead us to the treasure?

30
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,200
OK. But I'm not a pirate.

31
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,640
We need to get to the island.

32
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,640
- Who's with me?  - Absolutely!

33
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,960
Anyone else?

34
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,800
- Rrr.  - Ah.  - Mm.  - Sss.

35
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,680
Rams!

36
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,600
Baa! Baa!

37
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,640
Ah-ah!

38
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,280
Try again!

39
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,600
Ff...

40
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,240
- Rrr.  - Ah.  - Ff.  - Teh.

41
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,880
Raft!

42
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,680
Climb aboard, shipmates!

43
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,080
Arr! I mean, let's go!

44
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,120
Fff...

45
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,120
Fff... Fff...

46
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,000
Right.

47
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,680
Teh-teh. There's no treasure here.

48
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,640
Pity you're not a pirate, R. A pirate would know what to do.

49
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,680
What would a pirate do?

50
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,720
Arrr!

51
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,160
Listen and I'll tell you.

52
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,520
A pirate wears a black eye patch

53
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,440
And reads old maps for pleasure

54
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,000
A pirate sails across the sea in search of buried treasure

55
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,600
A pirate does exciting things and says, "Arr!" a lot

56
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,920
A pirate knows just where to look because "X" marks the spot. 

57
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,720
Did somebody say "X"?

58
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,560
Leave this to me.

59
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,600
A pirate sings, a pirate swings

60
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,400
A pirate laughs... Ha-har!

61
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,240
This letter is a pirate

62
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,400
This pirate's name is Rrr!
