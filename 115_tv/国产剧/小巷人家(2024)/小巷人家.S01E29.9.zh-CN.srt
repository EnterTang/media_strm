1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,340
- SIREN WAILS
- 'Octonauts, to your stations!'

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,020
Barnacles!

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,460
Kwazii!

4
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,060
Peso!

5
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,700
- Explore!
- Rescue!
- Protect!

6
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,020
Octonauts!

7
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,180
KWAZII YAWNS

8
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,100
These night missions are tough, Captain.

9
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,500
We've been working so late, it's nearly morning.

10
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,740
At least all's well in the ocean.

11
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:06,300
- BARNACLES YAWNS
- It'll be great to get some sleep.

12
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,700
Aye.

13
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,740
- LOUD RUMBLE
- What's wrong?

14
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,180
Hmm? Nothing.

15
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,060
VERY LOUD RUMBLE

16
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:19,580
- If nothing's wrong, why do you keep growling?
- Huh? Oh, that's not me!

17
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,900
It's my belly. I guess I'm hungry.

18
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,060
Hm, come to think of it, my belly's feeling a bit empty too.

19
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,500
How about you, Peso? Are you hungry?

20
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,380
There's a monkey?! Where?

21
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,900
Ha-ha! No monkey, Peso. We're all just tired and hungry.

22
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,860
I see a nice sea-grass meadow coming up.

23
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,940
What do you say we stop there for breakfast?

24
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,460
- Aye!
- Yes, please!

25
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,940
I'm so glad Tunip packed all this food for us.

26
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,300
Me too. I'm starving now.

27
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,540
Ooh, kelp cakes - my favourite!

28
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,100
Bleugh! Liquorice flavour - my least favourite!

29
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,860
I can never get these thingies to work.

30
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,580
Oops! Ha-ha! Sorry.

31
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,060
Mm! Strawberry-jam flavoured kelp. Now that's more like it!

32
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,420
I'll have some of that, please.

33
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,860
Look over there!

34
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,740
Sea horses!

35
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:28,140
What in the seven seas...? Look at those two!

36
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,420
They're dancing like some crazy underwater merry-go-round.

37
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,220
I've never seen anything like it!

38
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,460
Let's investigate.

39
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,420
A-hem! Excuse me! Sea horses!

40
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:44,420
We couldn't help but notice your amazing dance.

41
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,380
Aw, thanks, man.

42
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:50,340
It's a sea horse thing. We do a special dance of love.

43
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,180
And change colours to show how much we like each other.

44
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,620
Yeah. I'm Sonny and this is Janice.

45
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,100
We are the Octonauts.

46
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,540
I'm Captain Barnacles and this is Kwazii and Peso.

47
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,900
Good to meet you, Sonny and Janice.

48
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,660
Isn't she wonderful?

49
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,420
One look and I knew she was the one for me.

50
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,580
Oh, Sonny! You're so sweet.

51
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,140
They certainly look happy together.

52
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:19,580
Captain, they, em...seem kind of busy with their dance...

53
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,860
and everything.

54
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,020
Hm. Let's, er, head back to the Octopod.

55
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,060
Bye, Janice and Sonny.

56
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,220
- So long, man.
- Be happy!

57
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,340
How much further, Captain?

58
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,060
Not too far. Water is getting a bit rough though.

59
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,140
- BEEP!
- 'Octopod to GUP-A. Come in, please.'

60
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,020
We read you, Dashi. Is everything OK?

61
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,820
There's a big storm heading this way.

62
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,780
Suggest you return to the Octopod as soon as possible.

63
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,860
Thanks, Dashi! We're on our way back now. Barnacles out.

64
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,060
Avast! Look at the fishies, mates.

65
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,980
They're all heading for cover.

66
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:10,180
When a storm approaches, fish know to head for deeper water.

67
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,060
It's safer down below. We'll do the same.

68
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,220
Phew! Home sweet Octopod.

69
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,580
This storm could last a while.

70
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,860
- It's a big one, Captain.
- Hm.

71
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,020
- Huh?
- Oh! Whoa!

72
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,540
Look, it's Janice!

73
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,220
- She's in trouble!
- Argh!

74
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,860
Peso, sound the Octo alert!

75
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,860
- SIREN WAILS
- Octonauts, to the launch bay!

76
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,540
Octonauts, our sea horse friend Janice is lost in the storm.

77
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,420
We're going out to save her.

78
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,300
GUP-A's all powered up and ready to go, Cap.

79
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,820
Peso, Kwazii, into the GUP-A.

80
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,220
Yow!

81
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,740
Tweak, open the Octo hatch!

82
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,260
Right away, Cap.

83
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,460
Hold on, Octonauts.

84
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,940
This could get bumpy!

85
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,220
Grrr! Ugh! Agh! Ugh!

86
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:34,580
Ya! 'Tis a rough one, maties! Yow!

87
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:38,940
Flappity flippers! You're enjoying this, aren't you, Kwazii?

88
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:44,020
Aye! There be nothing like an ocean storm to make a pirate feel alive!

89
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,180
Ha-ha!

90
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,940
Ugh! Keep your eyes peeled for Janice.

91
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,700
I don't see her anywhere.

92
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,220
There she be, holding on by her tail!

93
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,100
Aaargh! Oh!

94
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,700
Grrrr! Ugh!

95
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,900
Oh! Whoa!

96
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:08,540
I'll get as close to her as I can and, Kwazii, you...

97
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,140
- Kwazii!
- Yow!

98
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,140
I'm coming, me hearty!

99
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,740
Oh! Whoa!

100
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,860
Ugh!

101
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,700
- Ah!
- Oh!

102
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,900
Gotcha!

103
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,020
I'll get the water tank ready for Janice, Captain.

104
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,660
Good thinking, Peso!

105
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,820
Thanks for saving me.

106
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,620
How did you get dragged into this storm?

107
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:41,180
The water just swept me away. Sea horses aren't very good swimmers.

108
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,260
We go where the water takes us.

109
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,940
Come to the Octopod and rest till the storm is over.

110
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,860
But we need to find Sonny. The water pulled him away too and I'm worried.

111
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,980
He's about to have our babies.

112
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,260
In that case, we'd best... What did you say?!

113
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:01,820
Sonny is about to give birth to our babies. I hope he's OK.

114
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:07,260
But...daddies don't have babies, mums do! Don't they?

115
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,100
Not when you're a sea horse.

116
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,420
Daddy sea horses carry babies in a special pouch

117
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,620
until they're ready to be born.

118
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,660
Well, I'll be a sea monkey's uncle!

119
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,260
Janice, on my honour as an Octonaut,

120
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,300
we'll find Sonny and make sure he's safe.

121
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,020
Barnacles to Shellington and Dashi.

122
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,020
- Captain?
- Go ahead, Captain.

123
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,420
We need to find out which way the storm is headed.

124
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,260
A sea horse has been swept along with it.

125
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,220
- Aye, sir!
- Leave it to us.

126
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,660
Got it! Captain, the storm is moving over the reef

127
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,420
and then past some big rock formations.

128
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,260
We'll send a map right now.

129
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,900
Good work, Octonauts.

130
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,420
We'll search the reef first.

131
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,100
Do you see him?

132
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,700
Ach, not yet.

133
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,700
We'll check the rocks next.

134
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,460
Look out!

135
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,100
What if we can't find him?

136
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,740
Don't worry, we won't give up!

137
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,220
We still need to search that kelp forest up ahead.

138
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,940
We don't want to get the GUP-A stuck in this kelp.

139
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,300
We'll get out and search for Sonny.

140
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,060
- Sonny?
- Are you here, matey?

141
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,740
- Sonny!
- Sonny!

142
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,300
Hm, at least the storm is finally calming down.

143
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,060
But where's Sonny? I guess we'll never find him.

144
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,820
Ah! Look!

145
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,700
A sea horse!

146
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,860
Excuse me, are you Janice?

147
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:14,540
Who, me? No, I'm Kwazii and I'm not a sea horse, I'm a...

148
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,860
I'm Janice.

149
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,900
Janice! Thank goodness you found us!

150
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,660
Sonny is about to give birth! You're just in time.

151
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,060
Oh! Where is he?

152
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,700
Please take us to him now. I'm a medic - I can help.

153
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,500
Over there. Near that seaweed.

154
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,060
Come on, Sonny. Oh...

155
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,300
Congratulations, Janice. >

156
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,180
It's a boy!

157
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,460
And a girl!

158
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,780
Oh, my!

159
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,420
And another girl.

160
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,380
And a boy and a boy

161
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,740
and another girl

162
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,180
and a boy

163
