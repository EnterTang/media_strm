We're just nobodies...

加,你欠我们,小班
Plus -- You owe us, Tennyson.

156
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,750
在学校了你身边,嗯?
Who took your side at school, huh?

157
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:01,615
这是真的。

That's true.

And the whole thing

整个是无名之辈,不容易承认。
about being nobodies -- that

160
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,488
整个是无名之辈,不容易承认。
couldn't have been easy for them

整个是无名之辈,不容易承认。
to admit.

162
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:08,019
也许它不会伤害。
Maybe it wouldn't hurt.

163
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,332
有一段时间，好吗？
For a while, okay?

164
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,628
我们将会看看会发生什么。
We'll see how it goes.

165
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:16,827
算了吧。
Forget it.

166
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,167
别把我算在内。
Count me out.

167
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:21,468
我们会给你们百分之十的
We'll give you 10% of the

30，加上一个签约奖金。

让我们施一些魔法。
Let's make some magic.

172
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:36,278
是的，我们不可能看起来不多
Yeah, we may not look like

173

但小班会不见
much, but Ben 10 would be lost

我们将丢失

We call <i>all</i> the shots.

我们的行动要经大脑想一想。
We're the brains behind the operation.

大脑，是吗
PSYPHON:
The brains, eh?

我应该知道。

没有任何明确的承诺。
Nothing specific.

他们总是在寻找外星科技。
They're always looking for alien tech.

182
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,211
事实上,我听见他们说
Actually, I heard them say

183
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:03,680
他们会得到什么
they'd gotten what they needed

在起飞之前。
before they took off.

185
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,751
也许我们应该跟踪他们。等一等。
Maybe we should track them down. Hold on.

Whoa! Ow!

这是什么？
What's this?

191
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:20,594
一个外星机件
Itâs a laser lance.

酷！
Cool!

武器是你需要的

最后一件物品。

好吧。我得到了他。我们走吧。
Okay. I got him. Let's go.

00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:31,206
好的。
Great.

哦,它是好的,

是的，我们还有最后一个节目。
Yeah, we've still got a show to do.

202
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:37,275
实际上,它不是好的。
Actually, it's not okay.

我们——
We --

所以是什么样子的?
So what's it like being you?

太棒了。
Awesome.

我知道他！
I knew it.

看 Cash，额
Look, Cash, o-on second thought,

210
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,663
也许你的主意不太好
maybe you coming isn't a good idea.

211
00:08:58,738 --> 00:08:59,568
危险！
The danger --

00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:00,799
我不想说什么，
I didn't want to say anything,

213

但是我需要钱
but I need the money

因为
this'll bring in.

啊，来吧
Aw, come on.

他说的是真话。
He's telling the truth.

00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,613
我可以看到他的光环。
I can see it in his aura.

219

看见他的光环？
"See it in his aura" ?

220
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:12,909
You just made that up.

221
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:18,623
That's where we
blew up Vilgax's ship.

222
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,283
We had Ben and
the others keep

223
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:21,792
him occupied with
good, old fisticuffs.

224
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:24,796
Meantime, JT and I,
we, uh, um, we...

225
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,295
Uh, set the power
core to overload?

226
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,500
They blew up the --

227
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,662
I mean, yeah. Sure.

228
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,897
That's what happened.

Good thing you got

00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,269
them to pick up
your slack, huh, Ben?

231
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:38,573
This is where Ben got

outmaneuvered
by three old

hadn't been
calling the shots.

235

I don't remember it

236
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:45,751
happening that way.

[ clears throat ]

But I could be wrong.

239

This is where the null
void gateway was.

240
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,186
Ben got stuck in
there for a while.

241
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,693
Good thing I stuck a tracking

242

device on him or he'd still be

243

Okay! Rath time!

You promised.

00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,829
Fine, but let's stop

247
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:05,200
goofing around and go
get that Forever Knight.

248

BEN:
Are you sure this is the place?

249
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:19,179
GWEN:
Yep. Top floor.

250
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:22,015
Itâs a trap. Has to be.

251
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:23,487
Or maybe the guy we're

252
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:24,853
chasing just went home.

00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,484
I mean, are they
Forever Knights 24/7?

254
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,720
Why don't you just go

00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,456
upstairs and
knock on his door?

256

around this way?

Yup.

it powers whatever you
found in the other ship.

drains the energy out of

292

converts it into
other kinds of energy.

I don't care!

311
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:39,279
I can't believe I'm saying this,

312
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:40,477
but keep your money!

313
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:41,383
Show's over!

314
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:42,579
Kevin, calm down.

315
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,952
They were just trying to help.

316
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:45,684
We don't need their help!

317
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,783
They're nothing
but trouble!

318
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:54,088
PSYPHON:
At last -- a chance

319
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,532
to destroy the
puppet masters

320
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:59,366
behind Ben Tennyson.

321
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:01,702
Yep.

322
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:03,833
Trouble.

323
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,579
You're Vilgax's flunky.
Psyphon.

324
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,525
PSYPHON:
Impressive that you remember,

325
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:23,221
considering what I now

326
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:25,923
realize is your
limited brain power.

327
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,096
Meet my REDS --

328
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:32,535
Robotic Extermination Devices.

329
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:38,476
So, you were the true

330
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,239
masterminds behind my master

331
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,246
Vilgax's defeat.

332
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:45,545
You watched our
webcast in outer space?

333
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:46,846
PSYPHON:
Oh, yes.

334
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,285
I find all of your primitive

335
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:51,846
computer networking endeavors

336
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,016
intriguing.

337
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,957
Okay, well, now you know.

338
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,927
So you know not
to mess with us.

339
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:57,826
Right?

340
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,956
PSYPHON:
Actually, I will

341
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:02,626
destroy you completely.

342
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:04,134
[ both whimpering ]

343
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:05,693
We're not gonna
let you do that.

344
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:07,795
PSYPHON:
This is none of your concern.

345
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,668
I'm kind of leaning

346
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:10,834
towards what he's saying.

347
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,172
Ow!

348
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,235
And now I'm
leaning toward you.

349
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,281
Guys, it's no big deal.

350
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,782
SPIDERMONKEY:
Spidermonkey!

351
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:20,944
Itâs just some stupid robots.

352
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,510
Psyphon's no threat.

353
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,146
Vilgax was the one with the --

354
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,749
PSYPHON:
With Vilgax gone, it

355
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:31,318
seemed a waste
to leave all that

356
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:33,126
power untapped.

357
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:35,931
This is no cheesy

358
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:37,229
re-creation, fans.

359
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,237
JT and Cash
will actually show

360
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:41,239
how they overcame
the power of Vilgax!

361
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:43,407
BOTH:
Aaaaaaaah!

362
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,966
Okay.
Interesting strategy.

363
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:01,189
[ both breathing heavily ]

364
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:09,895
Say goodbye, boys.

365
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:12,470
BOTH:
Oh!

366
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:13,368
PSYPHON:
[ groans ]

367
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:16,871
Uh-oh.

368
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:23,480
Ugh!

369
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,483
You think to defeat me?

370
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:29,014
You're in for a shock.

371
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,453
Me too?

372
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:36,792
Aaaaaaah!

373
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:42,199
OLIVER:
Brilliant strategy, guys!

374
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:43,529
It was nothing.

375
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:46,435
SPIDERMONKEY:
Aaaah!

376
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:53,041
Aah!

377
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:58,046
Ugh!

378
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:06,888
Kevin, get up!

379
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,256
We're still in trouble!

380
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:09,658
Let me sleep.

381
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:12,219
We're always in trouble.

382
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,469
SPIDERMONKEY:
[ screeches ]

383
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,532
Whoa!

384
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,019
[ grunts ]

385
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:41,651
Aw, come on.

386
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:46,723
Okay, guys.

387
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,061
What's the plan?

388
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,328
The plan is that I

389
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,563
destroy them
for what they did

390
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:53,570
to Vilgax.

391
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,700
We didn't do anything to Vilgax.

392
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,107
We made it all up!

393
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,543
We're total losers!

394
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:02,341
We never helped
Ben Tennyson at all!

395
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,607
We had to beg
them to do this

396
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:05,513
show with us!

397
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,846
I even told
Gwen that we

398
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,409
needed the money
for my mother's operation!

399
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:11,521
I didn't tell her it
was for a nose job!

400
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,455
But she <i>really</i> needs it.

401
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,360
You're not even

402
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,225
worth destroying.

403
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,424
ULTIMATE SPIDERMONKEY:
Ultimate Spidermonkey!

[ growls ]

405

It appears <i>you</i> are

406
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:28,701
the one I wish to
destroy after all.

407
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:30,939
Ugh!

408
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,742
Wait!

409
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:41,752
Cash, wait!
I-I have an idea!

410
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,084
Forget it.

411
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,090
You get to fire a weapon.

412
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:48,251
A big one.

413
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,386
I'm listening.

414
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:01,703
Wait.

415
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:03,070
I've got a better idea.

416
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,575
I still get to smash

417
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,634
them, though, right?

418
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:29,125
I love the smashing part.

00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:46,379
They're heading this way.

Excellent.

424
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:58,362
Let the world
see the final

425

moments of
Ben Tennyson!

00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:28,626
Huh.

428
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,490
I still got it.

00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,863
KEVIN:
Keep away from that!

430
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:40,199
It could go off!

431
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:41,569
It <i>did</i> go off.

432
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,335
We used it to save Ben.

433

We're heroes!

434
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,135

How did you...

200 tweets about it.

439
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:53,817
But we really did it this time!

ULTIMATE SPIDERMONKEY:
Guys, it's over.

441

No more taking
credit for my wins.

thing on camera, right?

Nope.

Camera lost all
its power right

when Ben there
zapped the bad guy.

We got nothing.

And thanks to your confession,

450
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:14,635
no one wants to watch you.

451
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:17,538
Even the internet
thinks you're a

452
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,439
waste of time.

453

Now, <i>that's</i> pathetic.

B-but he didn't
zap the bad guy.

<i>We</i> did.

456
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:29,644
The gun we shot
made the camera

lose power.
