1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,360
Ahhh!

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,680
After 10,000 years, I'm free!

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,680
Its time to conquer earth!

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,640
Alpha, Rita's escaped!

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,640
Recruit a team of
teenagers with attitude!

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,920
# Go, go, Power Rangers #

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:32,120
# Go, go, Power Rangers #

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,760
# Go, go, Power Rangers #

9
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,760
# Mighty Morphin Power Rangers #

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,360
# Power Rangers #

11
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,480
# Power Rangers #

12
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,280
# Go, go, Power Rangers #

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,280
# You Mighty Morphin
Power Rangers #

14
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,040
So Tommy, are you gonna go
to the beach with us tomorrow?

15
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,560
I really wish I could,
but guess what.

16
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,560
I'm trying out for
a karate commercial.

17
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,040
Whoa, you mean, like,
you could be on TV?

18
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,560
Yeah, can you believe it?

19
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,040
Oh, snap!

20
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,560
Did I stutter?
It's an audition isn't it?

21
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,040
Of course I want a limo!

22
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,040
Hello?

23
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,240
Better not get your hopes up
about that screen test

24
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,360
'cause I've got that
commercial in the bag.

25
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,610
Hmmm.

26
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,840
So you're gonna do
something like this.

27
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,800
Better do a little practice first,
just in case.

28
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,480
Boy, oh boy, I'm pooped.

29
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,920
I want a day off.

30
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,840
But you must lead us to victory!

31
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,360
I don't wanna. You do it!

32
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,200
Yes, my Queen,
and while you rest,

33
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,200
I shall obliterate
those pesty Power Rangers

34
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,680
with the worst monsters
the earth has ever seen!

35
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,930
Zack!

36
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,800
Sorry, Bulk!

37
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,120
This looks like a good spot.

38
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,240
It's a good spot.

39
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,800
Hey! Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya!

40
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,800
( laughing )

41
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,760
Your friend Tommy
is history, muscle brain!

42
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,760
I'm gonna get this commercial!

43
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,760
Ya-ya! Ya-ya-ya!
Ha ha ha ha!

44
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,160
Let's just wait and
see about that, Bulk.

45
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,960
Okay, we'll see.

46
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,960
Here! Get to work.

47
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,480
I need to get a tan
before the audition.

48
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,480
Come on!
I need to get a tan!

49
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,960
( grunting )

50
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,640
You airhead.

51
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,600
I wanna get a tan, not a bath.

52
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,040
( laughing )

53
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,680
# Tommy P's real brand mayonnaise #

54
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,290
# Mmmmm #

55
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,520
Here you go, Bulk.
Enjoy the view.

56
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,480
Oh yeah! Oh boy,

57
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,440
am I gonna look fresh
for that audition!

58
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,680
( snoring )

59
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,680
Ha ha ha! Perfect! The Rangers
have let their guard down.

60
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,840
Now I can take them by surprise!

61
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,600
The part's mine, Tommy.

62
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,640
You might as well go home now.

63
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,640
( laughing )

64
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,080
( yelling in pain )

65
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,480
Don't touch my sunburn,
you dimwit!

66
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,730
Next!

67
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,120
Not you, just him.

68
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,120
Could you take off
the sunglasses, please?

69
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,840
In here.

70
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,360
Okay, let's see what you can do.

71
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,720
Yeah. All right.
Check this out.

72
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,720
( imitates karate yell )

73
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:39,733
Oooooooowwwww!

74
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:43,720
That's a wrap.

75
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,880
Good, great.
Well, I think we've got our man.

76
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,130
Yeah?

77
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:02,600
Kiss hollywood goodbye, Tommy.
I'm their man!

78
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,040
( laughing )

79
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,680
( giving raspberry )

80
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,920
Hey!

81
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,400
- All right!
KIM: Good one, Zack!

82
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,360
TRINI:
I'll get it!

83
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,120
( gasping )
Oh my gosh.

84
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,680
Putties, attack them!

85
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,080
It's Scorpina!

86
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,960
And Putties!

87
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,120
ZACK:
Oh man, whoa.

88
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,920
It's Morphin Time!

89
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,000
Mastodon!

90
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Pterodactyl!

91
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,480
Triceratops!

92
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,480
Saber-tooth Tiger!

93
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,160
Tyrannosaurus!

94
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:58,960
Jason!

95
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,960
Now meet my pet worm.

96
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:09,760
What is this stuff?!

97
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,280
I don't know.
It's pretty strong.

98
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,800
Zordon, come in. Come in!

99
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,960
My communicator's signal is jammed.

100
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,440
Are any of yours getting through?!

101
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,960
No, what do we do?

102
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,520
Well, can we teleport out of here?!

103
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,800
No, and there seems
to be no way out!

104
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,520
Well keep looking.
There's got to be a way.

105
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,520
Throw them down the cliff
and into the ocean!

106
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,120
We're moving!
And it feels like we're on water!

107
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,480
Hang on, guys!

108
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,440
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi, Zordon!

109
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,880
The Power Rangers are in trouble,
and we can't get through!

110
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,400
They will be both brave and
clever and break the cocoon.

111
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,400
Meanwhile,
we must contact Tommy.

112
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,240
( beeping )

113
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,440
Okay, what have your years
of karate done for you, Tommy?

114
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,440
Well, it's really helped me
discipline myself...

115
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,440
especially with my schoolwork, plus,

116
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,440
it's given me a lot of self-confidence.

117
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,640
Great!
Well, let's see what you can do.

118
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,890
Okay.

119
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,160
Whew! Well, Tommy,
we'd like to talk to you.

120
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:18,360
Ai-yi-yi-yi-yi!
Zordon, tommy's not answering!

121
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,360
You must keep trying, Alpha 5.

122
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,760
The air's getting thin.

123
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,680
It's hard to breath!

124
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,480
Yes! ( laughing )

125
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,800
Whoooooaaa!

126
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,520
Let's try our weapons!

127
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,000
Maybe we can blast
our way out of here!

128
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,600
Set them on low power
and fire on my mark!

129
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,000
3, 2, 1 fire!

130
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,200
They're breaking through the cocoon!

131
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,200
Ai-yi-yi-yi-yi!

132
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,680
Teleport them to their Zords

133
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,680
as soon as they escape, Alpha 5.

134
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,280
Warn the Rangers, Goldar sent down

135
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,760
Babe Ruthless,
the baseball monster.

136
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,440
- Hyah!
- Hyah!

137
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,080
All right, log on!

138
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,920
Mastodon!
Time to kick it!

139
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,160
Triceratops! Online!

140
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,880
Pterodactyl! Ready to fly!

141
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,880
Saber-tooth Tiger!
Powered up!

142
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,600
( laughing )

143
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,840
( growling )

144
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,960
Play ball!

145
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,400
Let's do it!

146
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,280
Batter up!

147
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,800
Try my curveball!

148
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,640
Whoa! Oh man!
He's got Jase pinned down.

149
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,160
We gotta do something!

150
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,120
Right!
Let's come in from either side

151
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,160
and draw him away from Jason!

152
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,560
When Babe Ruthless
pitches his lightening,

153
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,040
all in its path shall be punished.

154
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,400
Rangers,
we have to take him down!

155
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:12,400
Everyone power up your weapons
and give it all you've got it!

156
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,320
Yeah! Way to go!

157
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,880
Yeah! That was awesome!

158
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,840
Morphin!

159
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,000
( beeping )

160
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,080
Zordon, what's happening?

161
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,040
The Rangers need your help.

162
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:40,480
They're at the industrial complex
in Downtown Angel Grove. Hurry!

163
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,920
I'm on it, Zordon!

164
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,480
Dragonzord!

165
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,400
All right!
Time for Dragonzord power!

166
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,400
All right! It's Tommy!

167
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,440
Great shot! Now let's pull it
together and show him what we got!

168
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,440
Nothin' to it but to do it!

169
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,880
Switch into remote!
Here I come!

170
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,440
All right!
With Dragonzord in Battle Mode,

171
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,400
we've got ourselves
a whole new ball game!

172
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,120
Jason!
We need the shield!

173
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:17,120
You're right, Billy.
Power it up!

174
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,640
It's bottom of the ninth,
and we need a home run!

175
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:33,640
All right! Let's do it!

176
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,320
Think you won the first round?
Well the worse is yet to come!

177
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,080
Yes, Zordon!

178
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,000
Scorpina is back in Angel Grove.

179
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,640
She's probably back in human form!

180
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,520
Let's go get her.

181
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,800
ALL:
Power Rangers!

182
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,800
Well, it's the power geeks!

183
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,920
Trap them, my pet!

184
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,920
And you better make
the cocoon strong!

185
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,840
Huh?!
This doesn't look good!

186
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,320
Oh no. If he traps us again,
we might never get out!

187
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,320
He's not gonna get us again.
We need Dinozord power now!

188
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,520
Let's go!

189
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,080
Let's do it!

190
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,560
Zack here!
In the groove again!

191
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,280
Billy! Back on track!

192
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,520
Trini! Ready to rock!

193
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,960
Kimberly! Set to soar!

194
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,640
Rangers!
Power up your Crystals!

195
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,680
ALL:
2, 1, power up!

196
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,640
Morphin!

197
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,240
Let's show him some
Megazord power!

198
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,240
Megazord sequence
has been initiated.

199
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,990
Megazord Activated!

200
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:28,480
Tommy, come in!
We need your help!

201
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,200
( laughing )

202
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,680
At last! Victory is mine!

203
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,200
Prepare for final destruction!

204
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,560
Right here, Rangers!
Morphed and ready!

205
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,510
( trumpet fanfare )

206
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,120
( cheering )

207
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:16,240
Time for Megadragonzord power!

208
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:26,000
ALL:
Log on! Full power!

209
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,680
RITA:
Nincompoops!

210
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,680
I take one day off,
and look what happens!

211
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,040
You'd think you bumbling fools
could do something simple like

212
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,520
destroy the Power Rangers,
but nooooo!

213
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,520
But, my Queen!

214
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,680
Don't you ever go after
those Power Rangers

215
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,680
again without me, understand?!

216
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,600
I didn't have anything
to do with it!

217
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,920
Don't be mad at me.
I didn't--

218
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,240
It was those stupid
monsters Finster made!

219
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,640
Stop yammering!

220
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,640
Why can't I ever win?

221
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,240
So how was the beach
yesterday, guys?

222
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,320
Well, it wasn't
exactly relaxing, Ernie.

223
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,800
TV ANNOUNCER:
And on the local front,

224
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,880
those amazing heroes
the Power Rangers

225
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,400
have once again successfully
defeated another attack

226
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,760
on the city of Angel Grove
by Rita Repulsa

227
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,200
and her seemingly endless
hoardes of monstrous thugs.

228
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,080
While the city sustained
some property damage,

229
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,200
no harm befell any of the citizens,

230
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,480
thanks to the incredible
Power Rangers.

231
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,320
Wow, great stuff, eh?

232
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,840
I tell you, you gotta love
the Power Rangers.

233
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,680
TV ANNOUNCER:
Well that about wraps it up.

234
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,120
Tommy, when are
we gonna see your commercial?

235
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,240
I can hardly wait myself.

236
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,680
I got the part, you know.

237
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,240
Oh really?

238
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,240
Say folks,
have you ever tried karate?

239
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,000
You might think you can learn
this intricate art on your own,

240
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
but if you tried, you could
end up looking like this.

241
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,600
Pretty miserable, huh?

242
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,160
Go sign up for classes at
the Angel Grove Karate Center

243
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,000
and you could look like this.

244
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,720
ZACK:
All right, Tommy!

245
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,640
All right, Tommy!

246
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,560
TV COMMERCIAL: Come in today
and learn how to master karate

247
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,600
at the Angel Grove Karate Center!

248
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,040
( laughing )

249
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,160
BULK: You call yourself a
manager, Skull? This is your fault!

250
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,500
