1
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:12,315
Hello, Doug, this is Dr Frasier Crane.
I'm listening.

2
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:16,789
'It's about my mother. She's getting on
now and she hasn't much of a life.

3
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:20,020
'She doesn't want to do anything,
go anywhere.

4
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:24,509
'She literally hangs around the house
all day. It is very frustrating.'

5
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,974
Can we go back for a second?

6
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:31,353
You said your mother "literally"
hangs around the house.

7
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,654
It's my pet peeve:

8
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:37,139
You mean she figuratively
hangs around the house.

9
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,410
To literally hang around the house

10
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:42,098
you'd have to be
a bat or a spider monkey.

11
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:48,086
- 'Can I tell you my pet peeve? '
- Sure.

12
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:53,861
'I hate intellectuals with superiority
complexes who nitpick your grammar

13
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:57,220
'when you ask for help.
That's what I've got a problem with.'

14
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,850
I think what he means is,

15
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:06,414
"that is a thing,
with which he has a problem."

16
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,650
It's time for a station break.

17
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:16,660
We'll be back after this message
from "Pizza, Pizza, Pizza".

18
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,068
Wanna hear my pet peeve?

19
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:25,040
You're in a store, the clerk
is helping you and the phone rings.

20
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:28,808
So he starts taking care of them.

21
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,043
You go, "I came here in person,
while some joker at home

22
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:37,219
"in his underwear is getting
first-rate service." Don't you hate that?

23
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:40,547
Actually, I do most of my shopping
by phone.

24
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,014
This got me thinking about my father.

25
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,304
He doesn't do much, either.

26
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:52,559
He just sits around watching TV
or doing the occasional crossword.

27
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:57,736
- What does your mother do?
- Wisconsin Attorney General.

28
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:01,315
- No, really?
- Really.

29
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,206
Oh... I guess that helps fill her day.

30
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:10,858
She says, "Crime never stops,
even in the dairy state."

31
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:15,215
I don't think public office
is for Dad, but...

32
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,139
Maybe I can find him a hobby.
Any suggestions?

33
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:24,387
Mom likes to water-ski a little.
She hikes, oil paints...

34
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:29,968
Oh, she likes archaeology.
She's on a dig in Honduras right now.

35
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:33,873
Well, maybe I could get him
a wood-burning set.

36
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,654
Is Dad still asleep?

37
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:42,344
Yes, with the dog.
Eddie's legs are going like mad.

38
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,618
He's dreaming of chasing rabbits.

39
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,592
But why is your father twitching?

40
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,232
Just about done with this thing.

41
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,620
Your dad will love it.

42
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,873
I was walking through the hobby shop.

43
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:59,206
It was "Eureka!"
I actually said, "Eureka!"

44
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:06,516
Ah, yes. There are a million stories
in the naked city.

45
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:10,482
Now, if we could just find a naked one.

46
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:16,651
Dr Crane! You naughty boy!
Peeking in on other people's privacy!

47
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,973
If people were concerned
about their privacy,

48
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,836
would they leave their blinds open

49
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,796
where you can see the mantel mirror
that reflects to the waterbed?

50
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:32,239
Your father's coming.
Stand in front of it.

51
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,615
We'll make this a surprise.

52
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:38,078
- Hi, guys.
- How was your nap?

53
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,740
I had the strangest dream.

54
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,446
A woman with bad breath
was licking my face.

55
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,540
Hey, where'd you just come from?

56
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,358
I got a surprise for you.

57
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:59,380
Hey, a telescope! That's a beaut!
What's the occasion?

58
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:03,129
- I just thought you'd like it.
- That's great, thanks!

59
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:06,124
I saw on the news,
there's a bunch of falcons

60
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,244
on the Columbia Tower.

61
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,217
- I can watch them from here.
- Forget the falcons.

62
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,969
You can see everything in that building.

63
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,212
I'd lock people up for that.

64
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:22,058
It's innocent. Just think of it as having
like 100 more channels to watch.

65
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:26,156
Just look,
people going about their lives.

66
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,186
There's an old couple watching telly.

67
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:34,267
Next door, an attractive young woman
is working at a computer,

68
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:38,767
while below her a burly man
is sopping up a large pool of blood.

69
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,989
- Oh, God!
- What?

70
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,150
Oh, Daddy!

71
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,415
Nah, that's tomato juice,
you can see the can.

72
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:54,146
- Yes, she is a looker!
- There's a voyeur in all of us.

73
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:59,254
Let's see what else
the Seattle skyline has to offer.

74
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:03,864
I say we make a strict rule. If anybody
does anything nasty, we move on.

75
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,450
Agreed?

76
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,679
I said "agreed"?

77
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,969
Yeah.

78
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:16,225
There's a lady with a telescope
looking back at us!

79
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,444
- What shall we do?
- Hide!

80
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,165
Every time I do something bad,
I get caught!

81
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,408
Hi! How you doing?

82
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,410
What are you doing?

83
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,259
- She's waving, I'm waving back.
- Don't do that.

84
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,897
Why not?
Wait, she's writing something!

85
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,126
She's holding it up.

86
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:42,100
It says, "Hello, there, stranger."

87
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:45,421
- Daphne, get me that pad and pen!
- What for?

88
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,315
I'll answer her.
Write down, "My name is Martin."

89
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:54,032
You shouldn't encourage her.
I don't want people looking in on us.

90
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,626
I don't think I made my bed today.

91
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,854
Is she writing anything else?

92
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:03,466
- Yeah..."My name is Irene."
- Her name's Irene.

93
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:07,258
- Thank you.
- Wait, she's writing something else!

94
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:12,490
"Is that Dr Crane from the radio
hiding there behind you?"

95
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,261
It does not say that!

96
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,103
Oh, it does say that!

97
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:22,962
Hello!

98
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,764
- Her oldest son is an accountant.
- He was the breech birth?

99
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:33,408
- No, that's the dentist in Boise.
- Oh, right.

100
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,003
He's got the wife that won't let him visit.
I can't stand her.

101
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:42,482
Morning, Dad, Daphne.
Morning, Irene.

102
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:47,654
When you were a kid, what was that
skin condition you had on your butt?

103
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,911
Pityriasis rosea.

104
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,158
- How do you spell that?
- Why?

105
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,768
Irene and I
are exchanging family histories.

106
00:06:56,041 --> 00:07:00,239
- Don't tell your girlfriend about that.
- She's not my girlfriend!

107
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:03,784
You've been exchanging notes
for the last three days.

108
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:08,242
If you were in the sixth grade,
you'd be sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g.

109
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:13,350
- Let me borrow that pad.
- What are you doing?

110
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,878
I'm going to help along
your little romance

111
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:19,659
and maybe save a small forest.

112
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:23,371
- I'm giving her our number.
- No, don't do that!

113
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,207
- Why?
- She'll think I'm being too forward.

114
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:29,161
You met peeping into her apartment.

115
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,440
She won't call.

116
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,657
- Want to bet?
- Yeah, five bucks.

117
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,425
(Phone)

118
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,440
- Aren't you going to answer it?
- You get it.

119
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,667
Dad, it's for you.

120
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:52,294
Hello? No, no, this is Frasier, hi.
I'm fine.

121
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:54,399
It, uh...

122
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,553
gets a little flaky
when the weather is dry.

123
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:03,188
- Tell her I'm not home!
- She knows you're home.

124
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,951
She can see you through the telescope.

125
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:10,787
- Come on, you're just a little nervous.
- Hello?

126
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,467
Hi...

127
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,974
Yeah, it's nice hearing yours.

128
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,076
Can you hold on a minute?

129
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,474
Would you two get out of here?

130
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,233
I'm getting a very good
feeling about this.

131
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:36,107
- You really think he's interested in her?
- Yes, I think so.

132
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,666
Do you want to hear something cute?

133
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,654
I made him this rich coffee cake.

134
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:45,772
You know what a sweet tooth he has.
And he wouldn't even take one bite,

135
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:50,819
because as he put it, "Women
don't like a spare tyre on a man."

136
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,182
That's so cute.

137
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:57,409
Oh, it's funny.
The twists and turns of fate.

138
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:01,379
If I had tried to set Dad up
with a woman, he would've refused.

139
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:05,417
But I go out, get him a telescope
and it kindles this romance.

140
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:08,314
It's kismet.

141
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,973
- Well?
- What?

142
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,259
- What happened?
- We talked.

143
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,559
Was she nice, interesting?
What did she say?

144
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:31,610
- A lot of stuff.
- So, you'll be seeing each other?

145
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:35,105
- She wanted to, but I said no.
- Why?

146
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,364
She's not my type.

147
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:40,213
Oh, coffee cake!

148
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,613
We got any butter around here?

149
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:51,694
You know the pompous twit
who's president of my wine club?

150
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:56,840
At the meeting, I convinced my fellow
psychiatrists to play a prank on him.

151
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,531
Thinking he was tasting
a Chateau Petrus,

152
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,878
he was in fact
sipping a Fourcas-Dupre.

153
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:09,344
- You see, we'd switched the labels.
- What scamps you are.

154
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:13,932
There he was, proclaiming the Petrus
to be the superior wine,

155
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,475
and none of us
could contain our laughter.

156
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:22,099
His face must have turned redder
than a Pichon-Longueville.

157
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:27,525
Of course, as so often happens,
roughhouse turns to tears.

158
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,873
At the end of the evening,
he tendered his resignation.

159
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,174
That must have ruined the evening.

160
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:42,583
- Not really, I'm the new president.
- Kudos, indeed.

161
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:47,811
Oh! Are Dad and his lady friend
still playing telescope footsie?

162
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:52,501
- What was her name?
- Irene. No, they've broken it off.

163
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:55,375
Already? I thought it was going well.

164
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:59,773
It was, then they spoke once
and then Dad said she wasn't his type.

165
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:03,076
It's over. He's cut her out of his life.

166
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,726
I just don't understand why he did that.

167
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,955
Who knows
why anybody does anything?

168
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,882
Remind me again
what you do for a living.

169
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,773
It was one phone call.

170
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:19,202
How can you make a judgment
about someone from one phone call?

171
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:22,148
Remind me again
what you do for a living.

172
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:29,925
I suppose it could be any number
of reasons - fear of rejection, shyness...

173
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:34,714
Maybe she just wasn't his type.
If only we knew someone who was.

174
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:39,302
I know! Maris's lovely Aunt Patrice
is in town visiting from Washington DC.

175
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:42,251
Maybe we should set Dad up with her?

176
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,493
I've met Aunt Patrice. She's a loon.

177
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:48,064
Do this for me.

178
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,403
When Aunt Patrice visits, Maris dives

179
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:53,467
under the duvet
with a two-week migraine,

180
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:57,225
and I'm left holding the bag,
literally and figuratively.

181
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:02,340
No, I don't think so.
I know Dad. Don't meddle.

182
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:07,273
- At least say hello to Aunt Patrice.
- I'm not driving out there.

183
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,953
She's out in the car.

184
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,859
- You left her in the car?
- I cracked open a window.

185
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,183
Oh, then she's fine.

186
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,192
No, calm down, son.
Listen to Daddy.

187
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,848
It's just a bad dream, I promise you.

188
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:29,677
Senator Thurmond is not in your closet.

189
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,946
That's a good boy. All right.

190
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:37,727
You go back to bed now...
I love you, too.

191
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:41,359
I'll see you next weekend.
OK, bye-bye.

192
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:45,674
- How's Freddy?
- He's fine.

193
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:48,966
He thanks you
for the toy gun you gave him.

194
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:54,184
Or what he can remember of it before
Lilith smashed it with a croquet mallet.

195
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:59,003
Oh, it's such a beautiful night.
The city is lit up like a jewel.

196
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,478
Oh, look, there's Irene!

197
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,971
She's sitting in her window
wearing a stunning green dress.

198
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,160
But her face... It's so sad!

199
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:14,920
Oh... Oh, she's holding a note.

200
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:20,395
It says,
"Martin, was it something I wrote?"

201
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:24,551
Will you cut it out.
Irene is not sitting in her window!

202
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,844
All right, but she might as well be.

203
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:28,497
(Doorbell)

204
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:33,435
- Ever met a woman who's not the one?
- Yes. Five years after I married her.

205
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,228
Hello, there Frasier.

206
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:39,555
Niles! I was specifically
not expecting you.

207
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,402
You remember Aunt Patrice?

208
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,612
Of course, Aunt Patrice.

209
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,937
I don't recall when we met,

210
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:50,273
but I remember
a lot of laughing, dancing.

211
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:54,133
- My husband's funeral.
- Yes! Of course!

212
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,973
Of course,
the laughter was to hide our tears.

213
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:01,132
- Let me take your wrap.
- We were driving and I thought,

214
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:06,221
"We're just a couple of short ferry rides
from Frasier's." So...

215
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,750
...we decided to pop over.

216
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:13,326
Is this the charming gentleman
you were talking about?

217
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:16,921
You bloodhound,
you've treed another one.

218
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,223
Yes, this is my dad.

219
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:22,715
How are you, Patrice?
I'm Martin Crane, this is Daphne Moon.

220
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,065
- Nice to meet you.
- Please.

221
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:28,872
What brings you to Seattle?
I came to see Maris,

222
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:33,878
but she's taken to her bed again.
I still have no idea how tall she is.

223
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,838
Patrice and I've had a great time.

224
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:44,203
If you call sitting in your waiting room
reading old magazines a great time,

225
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,587
then, yes, we had a laugh riot.

226
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:52,301
Now I know where Maris
gets her sense of humour.

227
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:56,521
Why don't I pop in the kitchen
and get us all some refreshments.

228
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:59,733
A capital idea.
We'll join you and give these kids

229
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:01,981
time to get to know one another.

230
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:06,990
- I told you not to bring her here.
- I ran out of ways to entertain her.

231
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,712
We went to the arboretum,
a fashion show,

232
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:14,191
we even spat off the top of the Space
Needle. I'm sorry, I cracked.

233
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,416
That woman is not Dad's type.

234
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:25,266
You never know when love can bloom
between two different people. Daphne?

235
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,591
I never thought opposites attract.

236
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:31,003
Neither do I. We're alike.

237
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:35,735
- We can't leave Dad alone with her.
- I'm sure they're doing fine.

238
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:39,299
D'go y'gou sp'geak g'g -speak'g?

239
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,881
- I was afraid of this.
- What?

240
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,710
D'go y'gou sp'geak g'g -speak'g?

241
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:49,264
Niles, I think
she's having a stroke or something.

242
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:53,002
No Dad, it's just g-speak.

243
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:56,119
- Come again?
- She trots it out at parties.

244
00:15:56,414 --> 00:16:01,886
You just put a "g" in every syllable.
So, you would be M'gar'g 'tin g'Crane.

245
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,968
Just say it with me.
Come on: M'gar'g 'tin...

246
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,822
I don't think Dad's interested.

247
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:13,405
- Oh, b'ge a good sp'gort, N'giles.
- What?

248
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:17,352
- "Be a sport, Niles."
- B'ge a'g sp'gort, ta-dah!

249
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:19,722
Dad, you still have your billy club?

250
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,539
It's in my top drawer.

251
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:27,765
It's all the rage in Washington.
You know who speaks it all the time?

252
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:31,191
G'george Ste'g 'pha'g 'no'g 'poul'g 'os.

253
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:39,204
I got pizza rolls but the expiration date
was yesterday. Are we game?

254
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:43,139
That's not necessary, Daphne.
We don't want to spoil our appetites

255
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,770
for that dinner in 20 minutes.

256
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:48,800
That's right, that dinner in 20 minutes!

257
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:51,731
I told you we shouldn't have
just stopped by.

258
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:54,924
- These people have plans.
- How I envy them.

259
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:58,056
It was such a pleasure meeting you.

260
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:02,424
- Likewise.
- Oh, no. You can do better than that!

261
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:05,206
(Giggles)

262
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:10,060
Oh, I look forward to
my next trip to Seattle!

263
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:14,459
If you're ever in Washington.
I'm in the b'gook.

264
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,521
What the hell was that?

265
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:25,852
- I feel sorry for the poor thing.
- I feel sorry for Niles.

266
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:28,560
That's who I'm talking about.

267
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:34,718
- You know I saw what you just did.
- What did I do?

268
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:37,125
When she went to hug you,
you moved away.

269
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,668
- Wouldn't you?
- You moved away from the window.

270
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,376
You didn't want Irene to see you.
You care about her.

271
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,646
Go chase yourself.

272
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:51,860
You do. Something is stopping
you from having a relationship with her.

273
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:54,757
You won't let go of this thing!

274
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:58,742
- No, I won't.
- All right.

275
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,912
- Irene's middle name is Rose.
- So?

276
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:05,005
Rose is a nice name.
It was Mother's middle name.

277
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:13,290
- Yeah.
- Oh, Dad.

278
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:19,987
Look, you can't feel guilty about that.
Mom's been gone for six years now.

279
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:24,704
Your feelings for Irene are separate
from those for Mom. If Mom was here,

280
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:30,774
- she'd want you to get on with your life.
- OK. When I'm ready.

281
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:37,258
Thanks Frasier. I guess I don't say it
often enough but you're a good kid.

282
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:41,326
Thanks. There's something
I don't say often enough...

283
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:43,858
There's nothing
you don't say often enough.

284
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:46,433
Right, Dad.

285
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,839
I couldn't help but overhear.
That was a very nice thing to say.

286
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:57,132
Yeah, he's a good kid.

287
00:18:57,387 --> 00:19:02,620
Strangely, I could have sworn
Irene's middle name was Marie.

288
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:07,057
- No.
- I can check. I still have all our notes.

289
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:10,309
All right, I had to tell him something.

290
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:15,921
He just won't believe me
when I tell him Irene isn't my type.

291
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:20,031
- You sure?
- You gonna get on my back, too?

292
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,677
No, but I was wondering

293
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:27,789
if the reason why things didn't work out
between you and Irene was... well...

294
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:30,921
- What?
- Well, maybe...

295
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,851
if you weren't a bit self-conscious
about your hip?

296
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:37,172
That's ridiculous.

297
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:41,705
I'm glad to hear that. You don't have
anything to be self-conscious about.

298
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:45,732
With that silvery mane,
twinkling blue eyes and whisky voice,

299
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:48,416
you're quite a package.

300
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:52,237
- Yeah, I'm quite a catch.
- You are.

301
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:56,446
And you know as well as I do,
history is full of sexy limpers.

302
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:00,852
For instance, Franklin D Roosevelt.

303
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:04,029
Of course,
he didn't limp so much as roll.

304
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:08,959
Toulouse-Lautrec.
Although he was a little person.

305
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:13,725
Still, he did well with the ladies.
Of course, they were all prostitutes.

306
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:18,370
But he was French -
there's no explaining their taste.

307
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:24,751
- What's your point?
- I guess I don't have one. It's just me.

308
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:28,019
But there is one little thing,

309
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:33,146
every time you went to the telescope
to see Irene, you hid your cane.

310
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:40,528
I just put it off to the side
so I wouldn't trip over the damn thing.

311
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:43,425
I knew there was a good reason.

312
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:47,411
It must feel awful silly
when that cane trips you up.

313
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:57,307
- Hurry up! She'll be here any minute.
- All right.

314
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:59,744
Have I got this tie on right?

315
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:04,526
It needs a minor adjustment.
What's all this hair on it?

316
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:09,883
The only way I can get the knot right,
is if I tie it on Eddie first.

317
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:17,232
Has dating changed much
in the last 40 years?

318
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:20,367
Well, the wardrobe
is a little different, but...

319
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:23,328
your ultimate goal is still the same.

320
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:31,083
- I'm glad you changed your mind.
- Me too. Thanks for our little talk.

321
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,414
Yeah, my pleasure.

322
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:35,863
Let's see, you got a hankie. Terrific.

323
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:40,281
- Got your keys? Don't be out too late.
- Frasier!

324
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,703
Just busting your chops.

325
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:44,687
(Doorbell)

326
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:46,681
Oh, my God!

327
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:49,889
Will you two relax?
A word to the wise...

328
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:55,259
If she asks you up to her place
after dinner, close the drapes.

329
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:05,356
Hi, Irene.

330
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:08,741
Nice to finally meet you.

331
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:18,346
# Hey baby, I hear the blues are calling
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

332
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:20,696
# Mercy!

333
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:25,679
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Well, maybe, but I got you pegged

334
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:33,577
# But I don't know what to do with those
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

335
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:35,730
# They're calling again #

336
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,299
Good night everybody!
