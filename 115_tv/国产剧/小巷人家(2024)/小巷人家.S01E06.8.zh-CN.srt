1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,960
A 4 year old boy has been found
dead in bushland

2
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,220
not far from the Brisbane River.

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,360
I found a jacket.

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,980
It had blood on it,
and it went missing.

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,140
Mr Linikus doesn't remember a jacket.

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,120
I think someone's trying to set me up.

7
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,040
Tell me what was in the bag that you
threw in the river.

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,500
And don't lie to me.

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,780
This isn't right! I love you.

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,240
He's taking me to see the fireworks,
or I swear I won't come back at all.

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,060
You are running out of track, Ben.

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,840
What else did he want to know?

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,260
How you got home.

14
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:49,350
It's the finish line.
Is she on her meds?

15
00:00:49,565 --> 00:00:52,242
What do you mean?
You'll figure it out.

16
00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:58,510
We could have another. What?
Nothing.

17
00:01:45,466 --> 00:01:48,529
Now he's representing Christy, so
I've got to find a new solicitor.

18
00:01:48,717 --> 00:01:50,574
Oh, sure. Yeah.

19
00:01:52,577 --> 00:01:54,536
Sorry, I have to go.

20
00:01:58,808 --> 00:02:00,126
Are you OK?

21
00:02:00,548 --> 00:02:02,677
Yeah. Ignore what I said earlier.

22
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,383
No, it's fine, really.

23
00:02:06,353 --> 00:02:11,432
So, see you... Soon,
yeah? Yeah.

24
00:02:15,173 --> 00:02:18,219
We'll have dinner.
Great. Take care.

25
00:02:30,824 --> 00:02:34,359
Hello? Dad?
Hey, Chook. Are you OK?

26
00:02:35,024 --> 00:02:36,487
I hate it here.

27
00:02:37,141 --> 00:02:37,786
I'm sorry, sweetie.

28
00:02:37,976 --> 00:02:39,653
Look, I hate it that you're there too.

29
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,361
It's not home, dad. 
I want us to be home!

30
00:02:43,546 --> 00:02:44,420
I know.

31
00:02:45,594 --> 00:02:46,283
Come and get me?

32
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,567
I can't.

33
00:02:47,794 --> 00:02:48,557
Then I'll come over.

34
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:51,379
No, no. Sweetie, that wouldn't work.

35
00:02:51,552 --> 00:02:53,357
Just stay at Uncle Malcolm's, OK?

36
00:02:54,092 --> 00:02:56,343
I've got to go, but I'll call you soon,
OK?

37
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:12,051
Paul!

38
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:17,521
They haven't arrested you yet?

39
00:03:20,927 --> 00:03:22,731
When do you go back over?

40
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:24,598
Friday next week.

41
00:03:25,282 --> 00:03:26,696
What do you want?

42
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,433
Unopened.

43
00:03:39,438 --> 00:03:41,984
This isn't for headaches, is it?

44
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,817
Bipolar disorder.

45
00:03:52,531 --> 00:03:53,978
How long has she been on them?

46
00:03:54,098 --> 00:03:57,448
She's been taking that stuff since I met her,
seven years ago.

47
00:03:57,647 --> 00:04:00,206
They reckon she's been taking it since she was 15.

48
00:04:00,877 --> 00:04:02,207
Why, not taking them?

49
00:04:02,732 --> 00:04:06,818
What happens
when she doesn't take them?

50
00:04:07,734 --> 00:04:09,207
Paranoid.

51
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:12,147
She used to accuse people of things.

52
00:04:12,356 --> 00:04:15,221
Wake up in the middle of
the night thinking I was gonna kill her.

53
00:04:16,398 --> 00:04:18,931
Well, I see what you did to her living room.

54
00:04:21,982 --> 00:04:23,488
One night I woke up.

55
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,137
I had a pain in my side.

56
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:31,930
She'd stabbed me here and here,

57
00:04:32,391 --> 00:04:34,690
before I got the knife off her.

58
00:04:39,864 --> 00:04:42,184
Why didn't you tell the cops?

59
00:04:42,438 --> 00:04:46,677
She was my wife. The mother of my kid.

60
00:04:53,622 --> 00:04:58,010
Mr Gundelach. 
Detective Cornielle would like to have a chat.

61
00:05:03,058 --> 00:05:06,134
Mr Gundelach. What do you want?

62
00:05:07,118 --> 00:05:09,087
How was Mr Murnane?

63
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:10,887
What do you want?

64
00:05:11,293 --> 00:05:16,090
I just want to clear something up
about the night before you found Thom's body.

65
00:05:16,462 --> 00:05:18,946
You went out drinking
with your friend, David Carroll.

66
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,706
Do you often go out drinking 
to excess with Mr Carroll?

67
00:05:24,196 --> 00:05:24,941
No.

68
00:05:26,027 --> 00:05:27,709
What made you go?

69
00:05:28,002 --> 00:05:28,906
Why do you want to know?

70
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,786
Because now I want to. Why?

71
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,704
You cheated on me.
I have a right to know.

72
00:05:32,921 --> 00:05:34,314
Tell me who it was.

73
00:05:34,832 --> 00:05:36,370
Did you fight about Ms Murnane?

74
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,931
We'd been fighting about a lot of things.

75
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:42,221
But it finished on the subject of Ms Murnane.

76
00:05:42,555 --> 00:05:44,403
Jess Murnane? 
You said you wanted to know.

77
00:05:44,984 --> 00:05:46,896
I wave to her every fucking morning, Ben!

78
00:05:47,068 --> 00:05:48,889
It's ancient history. It was five years ago, Chris.

79
00:05:49,071 --> 00:05:50,633
Where are you going? 
Are you going to go see her now?

80
00:05:50,825 --> 00:05:52,028
No, I'm going out.

81
00:05:52,207 --> 00:05:54,168
So you went out drinking with Mr Carroll.

82
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,653
A few hours passed.

83
00:05:57,175 --> 00:05:59,398
He puts you in a taxi?

84
00:06:00,211 --> 00:06:01,467
So he says.

85
00:06:01,658 --> 00:06:03,249
You don't remember?

86
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:12,508
Maybe a Black & White Cab pulled up here?

87
00:06:12,782 --> 00:06:15,054
Paid the driver in cash?

88
00:06:18,451 --> 00:06:19,671
Shut the door?

89
00:06:23,142 --> 00:06:26,630
Taxi reverses,

90
00:06:28,871 --> 00:06:33,285
then drove down the street that way.

91
00:06:44,392 --> 00:06:46,036
And then what?

92
00:06:52,876 --> 00:06:54,552
I went home.

93
00:06:56,501 --> 00:06:59,815
I opened my gate.

94
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,313
And then I went inside to bed.

95
00:07:02,643 --> 00:07:04,895
Didn't go across the street?

96
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:07,630
No.

97
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,925
That's funny.

98
00:07:15,715 --> 00:07:19,275
Because look at this.

99
00:07:31,345 --> 00:07:34,448
What we can make of it, you pulled up,

100
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,794
paid the driver in cash,

101
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,317
shut the door,

102
00:07:39,717 --> 00:07:50,337
cab reverses, and then...

103
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:56,429
What happened?

104
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:11,563
I must have made a mistake.

105
00:08:11,897 --> 00:08:17,823
Maybe I thought I was on
the other side of the road.

106
00:08:18,384 --> 00:08:20,797
I really don't remember.

107
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,281
OK.

108
00:08:29,318 --> 00:08:31,935
Anything else you want to tell me?

109
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,746
Did you get home before me?

110
00:09:20,104 --> 00:09:21,679
I couldn't have. Could I?

111
00:09:22,137 --> 00:09:23,730
No, I don't remember.

112
00:09:23,927 --> 00:09:25,536
Neither do I!

113
00:09:28,158 --> 00:09:30,958
Ohhhh...

114
00:09:31,464 --> 00:09:36,664
Uh... What? Ummm...

115
00:09:37,222 --> 00:09:40,290
Yeah, I might have put something 
extra in your drink that night.

116
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:38,991
You what?

117
00:09:40,908 --> 00:09:42,998
You spiked... It's just liquid ecstasy.

118
00:09:43,036 --> 00:09:45,945
Strictly speaking, it was GBH with
a little bit of molly to balance.

119
00:09:46,238 --> 00:09:48,460
You're not supposed to mix it with
booze, but you were so stress, mate.

120
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:49,634
What does it do?

121
00:09:49,867 --> 00:09:50,766
It's supposed to relax you.

122
00:09:50,967 --> 00:09:53,045
Mate,  I can't remember half of what happened!

123
00:09:53,436 --> 00:09:54,513
Yeah, well it can do that too.

124
00:09:54,816 --> 00:09:56,599
Fucking hell, Dave! I'm sorry, mate.

125
00:09:56,806 --> 00:09:57,526
I was actually trying to help.

126
00:09:57,741 --> 00:09:59,797
What, and you didn't think
you should tell me this?

127
00:09:59,996 --> 00:10:00,755
I didn't think it would matter!

128
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,068
Fuck! Ben-o, mate,

129
00:10:04,595 --> 00:10:06,489
it's easy just show the cops this,
Yes

130
00:10:06,729 --> 00:10:08,913
and they're off you and onto
her like flies to shit.

131
00:10:09,102 --> 00:10:10,391
That's not enough!
 It is, mate.

132
00:10:10,631 --> 00:10:11,895
She's a psycho! This proves it!

133
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:12,995
It's not enough, OK!

134
00:10:13,282 --> 00:10:14,633
They have so much more on me than that.

135
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,564
Well, you've got to find that bloody jacket!

136
00:12:23,289 --> 00:12:24,959
What are you doing?

137
00:12:26,993 --> 00:12:28,112
Ben?

138
00:12:32,288 --> 00:12:35,167
Put that down, please.

139
00:12:35,386 --> 00:12:36,539
What happened?

140
00:12:37,386 --> 00:12:38,939
Put her down.

141
00:12:43,343 --> 00:12:44,961
You should go.

142
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,751
You should tell me about the Teritol.

143
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:53,269
You really should go. 
Or what?

144
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:55,618
You're going to do to me 
what you did to Paul?

145
00:12:55,813 --> 00:12:56,585
Get out!

146
00:12:56,773 --> 00:12:57,877
Where's the jacket?

147
00:12:58,057 --> 00:12:59,548
What are you talking about?

148
00:12:59,724 --> 00:13:02,281
It's the one that I found, 
the one that vanished!

149
00:13:02,547 --> 00:13:04,506
You were here when I
chased that guy into the bush.

150
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,485
Where is it?

151
00:13:09,854 --> 00:13:12,403
you think

152
00:13:12,642 --> 00:13:16,861
you think I killed my boy?

153
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:26,674
You don't know! 
You don't know! You don't know!

154
00:13:28,668 --> 00:13:30,969
He was mine too.

155
00:13:31,283 --> 00:13:32,924
You think you know, then?

156
00:13:33,153 --> 00:13:35,502
You think you know what it's like
to lose a child?

157
00:13:35,908 --> 00:13:37,714
You have no idea.

158
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,686
I did lose a child.

159
00:13:39,883 --> 00:13:43,022
You've still got yours.

160
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,256
You'll pay for this.

161
00:14:18,044 --> 00:14:20,286
Jess Murnane had a daughter.

162
00:14:20,644 --> 00:14:22,016
She died.

163
00:14:22,448 --> 00:14:24,118
Charlotte.

164
00:14:24,393 --> 00:14:27,686
Sudden infant death syndrome. 
Eight weeks old.

165
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:31,655
You knew about the Teritol?

166
00:14:31,933 --> 00:14:36,592
And before that, the Balporoid, and the lithium.

167
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,336
And you know that she
stabbed Paul Murnane?

168
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:49,264
That's the jacket that I found.

169
00:14:49,915 --> 00:14:52,753
That's the one that went missing.

170
00:14:53,991 --> 00:14:55,766
Had you seen this photo before?

171
00:14:55,956 --> 00:14:56,962
No.

172
00:14:58,971 --> 00:15:02,225
Had you been in Ms
Murnane's bedroom before?

173
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:04,579
How'd you know it was in her bedroom?

174
00:15:04,772 --> 00:15:07,211
How'd you find it?

175
00:15:07,492 --> 00:15:10,315
She invited me in this morning.

176
00:15:10,515 --> 00:15:12,132
What for?

177
00:15:13,493 --> 00:15:16,421
It was on her bedside table.

178
00:15:23,532 --> 00:15:27,231
And when did you find the
urn and the jumpsuit?

179
00:15:27,478 --> 00:15:29,775
Jess called you.

180
00:15:30,301 --> 00:15:31,302
What did she say?

181
00:15:31,537 --> 00:15:33,489
That you broke in without her permission.

182
00:15:33,804 --> 00:15:36,636
You took a photograph
without her permission.

183
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,193
And that you struck at her.

184
00:15:40,483 --> 00:15:43,123
She hit me!

185
00:15:43,555 --> 00:15:48,401
She's crazy. She lies.
And I think she killed Thom.

186
00:15:50,915 --> 00:15:53,526
I know how it looks to you, OK?

187
00:15:53,883 --> 00:16:01,253
I know you think that I did
this, but I didn't. I didn't.

188
00:16:05,479 --> 00:16:09,661
I didn't know that he was my son.

189
00:16:12,492 --> 00:16:15,268
I wish I had.

190
00:16:15,567 --> 00:16:20,124
I wish I had. If I had have known,

191
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,624
I'd have loved him.

192
00:16:25,886 --> 00:16:32,461
I didn't. Why?

193
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:36,288
Why would I kill him?

194
00:16:36,782 --> 00:16:39,109
We'll find that out.

195
00:16:40,842 --> 00:16:44,692
Thank you for coming in to see me.

196
00:16:45,618 --> 00:16:48,994
We'll return this to Ms Murnane.

197
00:16:54,193 --> 00:16:56,484
Two new messages.

198
00:16:56,984 --> 00:17:00,812
Ben, it's Christy. Give me a call.

199
00:17:03,569 --> 00:17:08,818
Ben, what's wrong with your mobile?
Call me!

200
00:17:15,259 --> 00:17:18,688
Hello? Yeah, it's me. Is she there?

201
00:17:18,918 --> 00:17:21,351
What? Is Eva there?

202
00:17:21,432 --> 00:17:22,121
She's not with you??

203
00:17:22,377 --> 00:17:25,752
Why do you think I've been calling you, Ben?
 Is she there?

204
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:28,688
I just got home. She called before.

205
00:17:28,906 --> 00:17:30,287
She wanted to come over.

206
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:35,010
Well, you'd better look. And you'd better
not be lying.

207
00:17:35,834 --> 00:17:38,342
I don't know.

208
00:17:46,092 --> 00:17:47,821
Eva?

209
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,580
Eva?

210
00:18:04,777 --> 00:18:07,427
Ben. Have you seen Eva?

211
00:18:07,627 --> 00:18:11,470
I thought Christy took
her to her brother's.

212
00:18:27,817 --> 00:18:28,885
Leave me alone, Ben.

213
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,248
Is she in here?

214
00:18:32,765 --> 00:18:34,605
Eva! Is she here?

215
00:18:34,977 --> 00:18:37,704
You've lost your daughter now, huh?

216
00:18:38,055 --> 00:18:39,786
Feels horrible, doesn't it!

217
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:42,090
Eva!  If you've done anything to her?

218
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,868
Get out! Let me in!

219
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:47,082
Get out! Hey!

220
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:51,237
What's going on?
 I've called the police.

221
00:18:53,609 --> 00:18:59,168
If you've hurt her, I'll kill you.

222
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:08,386
Shit.

223
00:19:13,263 --> 00:19:17,055
Mr Gundelach? Sir?

224
00:19:17,275 --> 00:19:18,867
Sir, do you have a moment? 
I need to ask you a few questions.

225
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,624
I'm gonna look for my daughter.
 You can do what you want.

226
00:19:20,853 --> 00:19:25,125
You can look in my house. 
I'm gonna find my daughter.

227
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:48,336
Hi, it's Christy Gundelach.

228
00:19:48,659 --> 00:19:52,200
Sorry I can't take your call.
Leave a brief message...

229
00:20:30,573 --> 00:20:35,143
Yes? It's Cornielle. Have you found Eva?

230
00:20:35,537 --> 00:20:38,109
No, I'm just checking
to see where you are.

231
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,465
You know where I am.

232
00:20:40,838 --> 00:20:42,398
You guys are in my street.

233
00:20:42,704 --> 00:20:45,328
I have just one question.

234
00:20:45,675 --> 00:20:49,592
You had sex this
morning with Ms Murnane.

235
00:20:50,086 --> 00:20:51,283
And?

236
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:55,314
Was it consensual?

237
00:20:55,646 --> 00:20:56,880
What?

238
00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:01,138
What are you talking about? 
Cornielle?

239
00:21:01,383 --> 00:21:05,758
What did she say? Talk to me, Mr Gundelach.

240
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:10,078
This is a very serious allegation.
I want to hear your side of the story.

241
00:21:10,405 --> 00:21:12,447
My side?

242
00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:14,521
Listen, I've got something on the stove.

243
00:21:14,709 --> 00:21:17,457
Just give me a sec, will you?

244
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:44,790
Mr Gundelach?
Mr Gundelach?

245
00:21:47,292 --> 00:21:48,779
Mr Gundelach?

246
00:21:56,256 --> 00:21:58,507
Open up! Police!

247
00:22:00,774 --> 00:22:02,658
Open up!

248
00:22:21,461 --> 00:22:23,899
Where is she?
You're insane!

249
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:26,194
Where's my daughter?

250
00:22:26,622 --> 00:22:28,920
Eva? Eva?

251
00:22:30,596 --> 00:22:34,174
Get out! Help me! Eva?

252
00:22:34,797 --> 00:22:36,827
He's in there!

253
00:22:44,986 --> 00:22:50,258
Eva...?

254
00:22:59,593 --> 00:23:04,057
Mr Gundelach, get down, please.

255
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:07,460
Where's my daughter? Get down.

256
00:23:08,021 --> 00:23:13,017
Down! Now! Hands. Show me your hands.

257
00:23:13,343 --> 00:23:15,309
Put them on your head.

258
00:23:15,503 --> 00:23:17,992
What did she do with my daughter?

259
00:23:39,481 --> 00:23:40,723
Where's Eva?

260
00:23:42,866 --> 00:23:44,245
I didn't do it, Cornielle!

261
00:23:44,514 --> 00:23:46,158
Arrest her! Arrest her!

262
00:23:46,373 --> 00:23:47,466
Mind your head, Mr Gundelach.

263
00:23:47,804 --> 00:23:52,597
Arrest her! Arrest her! Cornielle,
arrest her!

264
00:24:01,889 --> 00:24:07,390
Sir. Sir?

265
00:24:09,886 --> 00:24:12,997
What is it? 
You better come have a look.

266
00:24:53,011 --> 00:24:55,022
What the hell's goin' on?

267
00:24:55,422 --> 00:24:57,999
Eva's been found safe and well.

268
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,708
Where? At her uncle's.

269
00:25:05,141 --> 00:25:09,550
Kids, hey?
 All that panic for nothing.

270
00:25:13,586 --> 00:25:15,527
I want to get a solicitor.

271
00:25:15,818 --> 00:25:17,976
Does Christy even know I'm here?

272
00:25:19,932 --> 00:25:24,031
What the hell is going on?
Are you going to charge me or what?

273
00:25:59,287 --> 00:26:01,861
The 49 year old fisherman was
airlifted to Cairns Base Hospital,

274
00:26:02,164 --> 00:26:05,705
where he remains in a serious but
stable condition.

275
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,784
The police investigation into the murder of 4

276
00:26:07,982 --> 00:26:10,834
year old Brisbane boy Thomas
Murnane has been reignited,

277
00:26:11,037 --> 00:26:13,419
with the detention of the boy's mother
for questioning.

278
00:26:13,797 --> 00:26:16,030
The 32 year old woman was taken from her home

279
00:26:16,253 --> 00:26:19,735
by homicide detectives and is
assisting them with their inquiries.

280
00:26:19,947 --> 00:26:22,973
This comes after the recent release
 of Benjamin Gundelach,

281
00:26:23,306 --> 00:26:25,790
who had been a figure of
intense speculation after finding

282
00:26:25,994 --> 00:26:27,993
the boy's body in mid December.

283
00:26:28,221 --> 00:26:31,405
Lawyers for the woman insist she (Hey.)
was not involved in her son's death,

284
00:26:31,609 --> 00:26:34,429
and will fight any charges.
 A police spokes...

285
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:36,213
What did you get?

286
00:26:36,823 --> 00:26:43,735
Ah, massaman beef, green
curry and golden parcels. Yum.

287
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:47,021
Do you want to get started on the
mortgage papers?

288
00:26:47,207 --> 00:26:49,950
We should eat first, 
yeah? Good idea.

289
00:26:50,127 --> 00:26:51,494
Where's Eva?

290
00:26:52,294 --> 00:26:54,118
Eva?

291
00:26:55,273 --> 00:27:00,112
Jeez, not again. Eva?

292
00:27:01,012 --> 00:27:03,282
I'll have a look.

293
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:18,639
Come on, shug?

294
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:13,190
Hi. Hello.

295
00:28:16,847 --> 00:28:21,280
Hot. Yeah. Um, dad's inside. Mum too.

296
00:28:21,459 --> 00:28:25,236
OK. But I'm glad to catch you.

297
00:28:26,062 --> 00:28:27,461
Better get these iceblocks inside.

298
00:28:27,549 --> 00:28:29,036
This won't take long.

299
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:37,565
Had us all quite worried
that day you disappeared.

300
00:28:37,689 --> 00:28:39,302
I told mum I was sorry.

301
00:28:40,355 --> 00:28:41,730
Where'd you go?

302
00:28:42,922 --> 00:28:45,918
Streets around Uncle Malcolm's.

303
00:28:46,939 --> 00:28:49,194
I spoke to a bus driver.

304
00:28:49,556 --> 00:28:52,930
Apparently a girl who
looked a lot like you

305
00:28:53,137 --> 00:28:56,657
caught a bus out here that afternoon. 
So?

306
00:28:57,574 --> 00:28:58,754
So it wasn't you?

307
00:28:58,935 --> 00:29:03,463
No.
 I really gotta go.

308
00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:05,929
Your father was quite desperate to find you.

309
00:29:07,649 --> 00:29:09,684
He thought Ms Murnane may
have harmed you.

310
00:29:09,869 --> 00:29:11,748
She killed Thom.

311
00:29:12,087 --> 00:29:16,975
He broke in, which was wrong,
searching her house for you.

312
00:29:18,571 --> 00:29:20,142
We found the jacket there.

313
00:29:20,328 --> 00:29:22,168
I saw the news.

314
00:29:23,765 --> 00:29:28,090
Before he went over, I was
talking to him on the phone.

315
00:29:30,134 --> 00:29:32,171
So?

316
00:29:32,464 --> 00:29:34,804
But he didn't hang up the phone.

317
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:44,646
We had to scrub the audio. At
first, it was quite feint.

318
00:29:45,357 --> 00:29:46,517
Dad?

319
00:29:54,221 --> 00:30:00,030
Dad? Dad?

320
00:30:03,062 --> 00:30:10,518
You came back, and you put the
jacket in Ms Murnane's laundry.

321
00:30:48,712 --> 00:30:54,011
1:16 pm. Resuming interview
with Eva Gundelach.

322
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:56,000
Now, Eva, I'm going to read back over

323
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:59,565
what you said before lunch
about the death of Thom Murnane.

324
00:30:59,595 --> 00:31:02,822
Do you understand?

325
00:31:03,001 --> 00:31:10,973
Anything I say that is in correct,
please stop me and tell me.

326
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,612
You said,

327
00:31:16,005 --> 00:31:18,778
"It happened the night
mum and dad fought.

328
00:31:19,068 --> 00:31:21,310
They'd fought before, 
but this time was different.

329
00:31:21,507 --> 00:31:24,053
It was loud and I went to listen.

330
00:31:24,273 --> 00:31:27,522
I heard mum saying she
wanted to leave dad.

331
00:31:27,853 --> 00:31:29,832
I'm not going to tell you who it was!

332
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:31,756
OK, you promise me you won't say.

333
00:31:31,934 --> 00:31:35,195
Tell me who it was. It was Jess. Jess?

334
00:31:35,475 --> 00:31:37,255
Jess Murnane? 
You said you wanted to know.

335
00:31:37,481 --> 00:31:39,815
"I couldn't let mum and dad break up.

336
00:31:40,007 --> 00:31:42,755
Couldn't let Jess Murnane ruin our family.

337
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:45,395
I had to make her leave the street.

338
00:31:46,514 --> 00:31:49,817
She wouldn't stay without her boy.

339
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:56,790
" If Jess didn't have Thom anymore, she'd go, 
and leave dad alone.

340
00:31:57,117 --> 00:31:59,999
"I waited till dad
got home.

341
00:32:10,715 --> 00:32:14,484
He went to the door and he came back home.

342
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:19,634
He came back inside and
I waited for him to go to bed.

343
00:32:32,749 --> 00:32:38,083
"I had a key because Tash used to
babysit for Jess."

344
00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:48,536
Hey, Thom. Thom.

345
00:32:51,937 --> 00:32:54,201
Wanna see something?

346
00:32:57,724 --> 00:33:03,363
It's raining. It's OK. 
Put your gumboots on. Hurry up.

347
00:33:03,546 --> 00:33:05,933
"The jacket was just there."

348
00:33:08,221 --> 00:33:09,535
Let's go.

349
00:33:11,362 --> 00:33:13,782
"And I took him up the track."

350
00:33:16,891 --> 00:33:20,860
Why? 'Cause. That's the way of the river.

351
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,364
I wanted to put him in the river

352
00:33:29,305 --> 00:33:32,548
"But we didn't get to the jetty.

353
00:33:33,092 --> 00:33:37,658
He didn't like the rain when
it got heavy."

354
00:33:52,968 --> 00:33:57,500
I wanna go home. Come on,
 don't you want to see the fish?

355
00:33:57,656 --> 00:33:59,288
I want to go home.

356
00:33:59,613 --> 00:34:02,060
Come on, we're almost there!

357
00:34:05,483 --> 00:34:11,184
Thom! Mummy! Thom!

358
00:34:12,712 --> 00:34:16,195
Thom! Get back here! Thom!

359
00:34:16,536 --> 00:34:20,816
Mummy! Mummy! Mummy!

360
00:34:21,032 --> 00:34:23,574
"So I hit him.

361
00:34:25,414 --> 00:34:29,426
I hit him on the head with a torch."

362
00:34:38,926 --> 00:34:42,711
I had to, to make him quiet.

363
00:34:56,249 --> 00:34:58,641
"And then I didn't know what to do.

364
00:34:58,852 --> 00:35:06,555
He was too heavy. It was too far to
the river. So I left him.

365
00:35:10,657 --> 00:35:13,955
Things kept going bad when I got
back to our street.

366
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:20,984
His mum was already looking for him.
 Thom! Thom?

367
00:35:21,201 --> 00:35:26,632
"So I went behind Mrs Bailey's house, 
where dad found that weird guy.

368
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:30,333
That's where I had
to leave the jacket."

369
00:35:49,008 --> 00:35:53,133
Christy. Christy? Ben!

370
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:55,755
Where's the phone?

371
00:35:55,957 --> 00:35:58,967
I thought dad
would still be asleep.

372
00:35:59,186 --> 00:36:02,254
Must have been right behind me.

373
00:36:02,473 --> 00:36:04,526
"Things kept going wrong.

374
00:36:04,747 --> 00:36:07,637
I went back for the jacket it was gone.

375
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,319
And then I found out you were looking for a torch,

376
00:36:10,566 --> 00:36:18,394
so I thought if I put dad's
torch back, you'd leave him alone.

377
00:36:18,767 --> 00:36:21,717
On Christmas Day, I heard dad get
up early.

378
00:36:22,176 --> 00:36:24,855
I followed him up to Mrs Bailey's house

379
00:36:25,468 --> 00:36:28,334
and I found the jacket there.

380
00:36:28,605 --> 00:36:31,642
" That weird man must have taken it.

381
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:35,997
"All I had to do was put it back in her house.

382
00:36:36,355 --> 00:36:40,555
" Now "her", meaning Ms Murnane?

383
00:36:40,817 --> 00:36:48,298
But mum mum made it hard.

384
00:36:52,008 --> 00:36:56,728
"I just wanted us to
have a normal Christmas."

385
00:36:57,149 --> 00:36:58,642
But it wasn't.

386
00:37:01,921 --> 00:37:06,683
"I came back with Tash, but then she came over."

387
00:37:08,044 --> 00:37:12,459
We'd only been gone a day, and she
was already after dad.

388
00:37:17,873 --> 00:37:24,653
Thom was gone. We'd gone. But she
was still there.

389
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:30,380
"I took a bus from Uncle Malcolm's,

390
00:37:30,608 --> 00:37:34,245
I got the jacket, and I waited."

391
00:37:36,227 --> 00:37:38,255
Eva?

392
00:37:53,231 --> 00:37:56,099
After that, I waited in my cubby.

393
00:37:56,743 --> 00:38:01,390
When I got back home, dad wasn't there.

394
00:38:01,578 --> 00:38:03,100
Dad?

395
00:38:12,602 --> 00:38:17,062
You know, you should have listened
to dad when he said he didn't do it.

396
00:38:32,113 --> 00:38:35,842
Is there anything else
you'd like to tell me?

397
00:38:40,024 --> 00:38:41,868
I'm sorry.

398
00:38:44,915 --> 00:38:48,759
None of this would have happened if
I just got Thom to the river.

399
00:38:54,407 --> 00:39:01,984
Mrs Gundelach,
this is your copy for you to sign, as guardian.

400
00:39:17,006 --> 00:39:17,962
It's alright, mum.

401
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:19,654
Everything's gonna be alright.

402
00:39:19,954 --> 00:39:24,262
No, it's not. It's not...

403
00:39:34,762 --> 00:39:36,997
Eva Abigail Gundelach,

404
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:39,582
I'm arresting you for the murder of
Thom Murnane.

405
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,266
You'll be taken to the watch house,

406
00:39:39,863 --> 00:39:44,888
charged, and arrangements will be
made immediately.

407
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,879
You'll report before
the Children's Court.

408
00:40:32,649 --> 00:40:36,278
I'm not sure what the magistrate
will decide for Eva.

409
00:40:46,399 --> 00:40:48,374
Mr Gundelach?

410
00:40:49,528 --> 00:40:51,927
Take care.
