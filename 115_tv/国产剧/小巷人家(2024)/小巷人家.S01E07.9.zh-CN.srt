1
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,029
So this is the show?

2
00:00:11,062 --> 00:00:13,566
This is what you're putting up there?

3
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,932
I've been staring at them
for, like, 10 days now,

4
00:00:16,964 --> 00:00:18,132
you know, trying to
stay objective about it,

5
00:00:18,165 --> 00:00:20,005
but, you know, it's really hard.

6
00:00:20,038 --> 00:00:21,702
I mean, that's Franklin right there.

7
00:00:21,743 --> 00:00:23,142
I've never seen Frank like this before.

8
00:00:23,175 --> 00:00:24,446
I mean, this is intense.

9
00:00:24,479 --> 00:00:25,878
Okay, you know what? Forget it.

10
00:00:25,911 --> 00:00:27,343
God, what are we supposed to say?

11
00:00:27,383 --> 00:00:29,510
I'm sorry, it's... it's
a little strange for me.

12
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:31,982
You know, you guys are just too
freaked out about your own stuff.

13
00:00:32,016 --> 00:00:33,583
- Oh, right, okay.
- Freaked out about the pop-up.

14
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:34,919
- Make it about us.
- Freaked out about the wedding.

15
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:36,318
Just turn it right around.

16
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:38,022
- What are you talking about?
- Come on, you're not freaked out

17
00:00:38,055 --> 00:00:39,054
about the wedding? You're
not freaked out about

18
00:00:39,095 --> 00:00:40,189
your mom meeting Richie?

19
00:00:40,222 --> 00:00:41,789
Listen, you fucker, you said you were gonna

20
00:00:41,822 --> 00:00:43,092
stop talking shit about Richie.

21
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:44,796
I'm not talking shit about Richie.

22
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:46,363
Come on, we all know how Danna can be.

23
00:00:46,396 --> 00:00:47,963
Okay, I know that, but
you mentioned Richie.

24
00:00:47,996 --> 00:00:49,530
Like, please stop talking about him.

25
00:00:49,563 --> 00:00:51,035
What did I say about Richie?
I'm talking about your mom.

26
00:00:51,069 --> 00:00:53,533
Okay, I am actually freaking out right now,

27
00:00:53,573 --> 00:00:55,110
so I'm gonna get another beer.

28
00:00:55,143 --> 00:00:56,542
All right, will you
get me another beer too?

29
00:00:56,575 --> 00:00:58,646
Sure.

30
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:00,046
He's incredibly high right now.

31
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,077
- He's like on the bug out.
- I know.

32
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,245
Look, you hired that guy.

33
00:01:04,286 --> 00:01:05,949
You paid him to have
sex with your boyfriend

34
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:07,484
and then you shot it.

35
00:01:07,517 --> 00:01:09,652
Now you're gonna show that to the world.

36
00:01:09,685 --> 00:01:12,385
I mean, we're your friends.
What do you expect us to say?

37
00:01:19,897 --> 00:01:21,297
Jesus, man.

38
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:27,167
What... am I gonna do?

39
00:01:29,536 --> 00:01:31,703
I'm starting to get
worried about the traffic.

40
00:01:31,736 --> 00:01:33,173
It's gonna be fine, Mom.

41
00:01:33,206 --> 00:01:36,204
And I'm sorry about my phone.

42
00:01:36,237 --> 00:01:38,908
Are you sure you have
time to stop by the hotel?

43
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:40,574
I'd hate to be without it today,

44
00:01:40,615 --> 00:01:42,648
but I don't want you to
be late for the photos.

45
00:01:42,681 --> 00:01:43,816
I'm not gonna be late for the photos, okay.

46
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:45,016
I'll stop by. I'll get your phone.

47
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:46,859
It's gonna go so quick.

48
00:01:46,892 --> 00:01:48,259
How's Megan?

49
00:01:48,292 --> 00:01:51,321
Oh, she looks beautiful, just lovely.

50
00:01:51,394 --> 00:01:52,625
- Good.
- I'm so glad

51
00:01:52,658 --> 00:01:54,264
she didn't go for that yellow dress.

52
00:01:54,297 --> 00:01:57,327
- That would have been a terrible mistake.
- Right.

53
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,431
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, come on.

54
00:02:00,464 --> 00:02:01,735
Where are you? We're waiting for you.

55
00:02:01,768 --> 00:02:03,442
I know. I'm on my way.

56
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:08,241
Well, we're really excited to meet your...

57
00:02:08,273 --> 00:02:09,311
friend.

58
00:02:09,344 --> 00:02:11,311
The wedding planner was thrown

59
00:02:11,344 --> 00:02:13,447
to have to deal with
a last minute plus one,

60
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,312
but I made sure that they squeezed in

61
00:02:15,353 --> 00:02:17,786
an extra chair at our table for Richard.

62
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,924
His name's Richie.

63
00:02:19,957 --> 00:02:22,029
Is it not short for Richard?

64
00:02:22,062 --> 00:02:24,031
No, Mom, it's just Richie.

65
00:02:24,064 --> 00:02:27,165
Oh, do I need to change
it on his place card?

66
00:02:27,198 --> 00:02:29,102
There's a card?

67
00:02:29,135 --> 00:02:30,470
Look, okay, I got to go right now.

68
00:02:30,503 --> 00:02:32,773
- My phone!
- I'll talk to you later.

69
00:02:32,806 --> 00:02:34,944
Yeah, I'll get your phone.

70
00:02:39,484 --> 00:02:41,388
Oh my God, you shaved.

71
00:02:41,421 --> 00:02:43,590
Yeah, you like it?

72
00:02:45,264 --> 00:02:46,896
I love it.

73
00:02:46,929 --> 00:02:48,033
Come on, we're late. Let's go.

74
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:49,938
I just... I got to show you. I...

75
00:02:49,971 --> 00:02:52,170
- I spilled some coffee.
- Oh, shit!

76
00:02:52,203 --> 00:02:54,370
Yeah, the bus driver was
driving like a maniac,

77
00:02:54,403 --> 00:02:55,842
but if I keep my jacket closed like this...

78
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,411
No, no, come on. I'll get you a new shirt.

79
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:59,211
- You can't tell.
- It's okay. Come on. Come on.

80
00:03:00,685 --> 00:03:02,718
All right, you know, I'm just
gonna go with a white one.

81
00:03:02,751 --> 00:03:03,919
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

82
00:03:03,953 --> 00:03:05,457
- I don't know. This is...
- The other way.

83
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,760
I'm such an idiot.

84
00:03:06,793 --> 00:03:08,791
No, no, no, it looks good.
It looks good with your...

85
00:03:08,824 --> 00:03:10,327
new face.

86
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,960
- You okay, Pato?
- Yeah, totally.

87
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:14,296
Totally excited.

88
00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:17,106
- For real?
- Ugh, I just got off the Skype with my mom.

89
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:19,042
Oh, okay.

90
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:21,372
But she's totally excited to meet you.

91
00:03:21,412 --> 00:03:23,108
You know you say "totally" a lot

92
00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:25,042
- when you get nervous?
- I do?

93
00:03:25,075 --> 00:03:26,847
- Totally.
-  Okay.

94
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,278
Give me your arm. Here you go.

95
00:03:28,311 --> 00:03:30,478
- Okay, okay.
- And that side, and that side.

96
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:31,847
- Where's my tie?
- I got it here. Let's do this.

97
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,151
Come on, we're late.

98
00:03:33,185 --> 00:03:35,217
- Hold on.
- You got to button your pants though.

99
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,027
Oh no, come on.

100
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,890
Oh, shit!

101
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:42,794
- What is it?
- I didn't turn my wheels.

102
00:03:42,827 --> 00:03:44,098
Fuck. Oh, God.

103
00:03:44,131 --> 00:03:46,163
- I can pay for half of it.
- No, no, no.

104
00:03:46,203 --> 00:03:48,100
Don't be silly. I
borrowed the car from Dom.

105
00:03:48,141 --> 00:03:49,869
Fifty-eight fucking dollars!

106
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:51,644
Jesus!

107
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,944
Okay, so here it is on the corner.

108
00:03:57,977 --> 00:03:59,647
Does that say Punjab Chinese?

109
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,342
Yes, it says Punjab Chinese.

110
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,478
Bombay meets Shanghai, I like it.

111
00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:04,781
It's fusion.

112
00:04:04,814 --> 00:04:05,812
Anyway, Lynn's friend's with the owner.

113
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:07,350
So they closed it in March,

114
00:04:07,383 --> 00:04:09,690
but they have the lease until next week.

115
00:04:09,723 --> 00:04:10,826
What?

116
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:13,226
So we get to rush in and rush out again.

117
00:04:15,258 --> 00:04:16,528
Anyway, everything's here,

118
00:04:16,561 --> 00:04:19,895
which is awesome because we
just need to freshen it up a bit.

119
00:04:19,928 --> 00:04:20,894
- Gotcha.
- You know?

120
00:04:20,935 --> 00:04:22,734
It's a one-night-only affair.

121
00:04:22,767 --> 00:04:24,136
Oh, hey.

122
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:25,938
- Lynn, this is Doris.
- Hey, hi.

123
00:04:25,971 --> 00:04:26,972
Hi. Hugo.

124
00:04:27,012 --> 00:04:28,707
No, it's not just another pop-up.

125
00:04:28,748 --> 00:04:29,979
It's the beginning of a...

126
00:04:30,012 --> 00:04:32,042
a Portuguese culinary revolution.

127
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,946
Whoa. So...

128
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:37,484
Uh, when are people supposed
to be eating in here?

129
00:04:37,517 --> 00:04:39,895
In about 28 hours.

130
00:04:39,928 --> 00:04:42,129
Excellent, okay.

131
00:04:42,162 --> 00:04:44,971
We're gonna need some swiffers.

132
00:04:45,004 --> 00:04:46,035
- I just... a minute, okay?
- You're blocking traffic.

133
00:04:46,068 --> 00:04:47,339
I know, I normally hate people like me,

134
00:04:47,372 --> 00:04:48,938
but it's only gonna take a moment.

135
00:04:48,971 --> 00:04:50,338
Okay, here he comes right now. See?

136
00:04:50,371 --> 00:04:51,907
- He's on his way.
- You gotta move.

137
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,747
This is loading only.

138
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,276
You don't have the... where's the phone?

139
00:04:55,317 --> 00:04:57,582
The front desk is saying they
don't have your mom's phone.

140
00:04:57,615 --> 00:04:59,455
- Are you serious?!
- Yeah, or at least she wouldn't give it to me

141
00:04:59,488 --> 00:05:00,655
'cause I don't look like a Murray.

142
00:05:00,688 --> 00:05:02,421
What are you doing? Jesus.

143
00:05:02,454 --> 00:05:03,922
I promise you, five more
minutes. Here, take this.

144
00:05:03,955 --> 00:05:06,291
- Yo, man. Hey! What are you doing?
- Richie, stay!

145
00:05:11,168 --> 00:05:13,503
Hey, Pauline. Agustín.

146
00:05:13,536 --> 00:05:15,436
Uh, listen. This...

147
00:05:15,469 --> 00:05:17,002
I hate this, but it's just not...

148
00:05:17,035 --> 00:05:18,298
it's not coming together.

149
00:05:18,331 --> 00:05:20,236
So I'm gonna have to bow out of the show.

150
00:05:20,309 --> 00:05:21,773
Sorry.

151
00:05:21,806 --> 00:05:25,017
Uh, I hope you have enough
time to find somebody.

152
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,251
Okay, uh, yeah. Thanks, bye.

153
00:05:37,532 --> 00:05:40,130
Acquaint yourself with the basic dynamics

154
00:05:40,163 --> 00:05:41,497
of a real bowtie.

155
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,664
- A standard bowtie consists of...
- What is that?

156
00:05:43,697 --> 00:05:45,166
What is this voice? What is this video?

157
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,703
- It's so cheesy.
-  I don't know.

158
00:05:46,736 --> 00:05:48,872
It's some weird YouTube Playboy thing.

159
00:05:48,905 --> 00:05:50,170
Okay, you know, ah... cold hands.

160
00:05:50,211 --> 00:05:51,307
You know what? Let's
just forget the bowtie.

161
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,380
- I got it.
- Let's forget the bowtie.

162
00:05:52,413 --> 00:05:53,813
- I got it.
- I like a challenge.

163
00:05:53,846 --> 00:05:54,845
I need to look at the phone

164
00:05:54,886 --> 00:05:55,947
to look at the Google Maps.

165
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,346
- Could you just stop with the bow?
- Shit. Whoa.

166
00:05:57,379 --> 00:05:58,480
When I say stop, I mean stop!

167
00:05:58,513 --> 00:05:59,751
Okay, please.

168
00:05:59,784 --> 00:06:01,645
- Okay, you know what?
- Pull over.

169
00:06:01,678 --> 00:06:02,749
No, I'm just trying not
to get us killed right now.

170
00:06:02,782 --> 00:06:04,686
I get it. Can you just pull over?

171
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:07,225
Okay, let me get off the
bridge first, all right?

172
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:12,027
What? No, don't get out of the car.

173
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:13,634
What are you doing?

174
00:06:16,568 --> 00:06:17,695
Come on.

175
00:06:17,736 --> 00:06:19,366
Come on, get out.

176
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:21,901
- You need to chill out.
- I'm chilled out, okay.

177
00:06:21,934 --> 00:06:24,904
Here, smoke this. I'll drive.

178
00:06:24,945 --> 00:06:26,543
You can relax, okay?

179
00:06:26,576 --> 00:06:28,877
You brought pot to my sister's wedding?

180
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,476
To meet my family?

181
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:32,243
- Yeah, I did.
- What the fuck are you doing?

182
00:06:32,276 --> 00:06:34,746
I'm not gonna smoke a joint right now.

183
00:06:36,245 --> 00:06:37,285
All right, you know what?

184
00:06:37,318 --> 00:06:39,653
I told you this was too soon.

185
00:06:39,686 --> 00:06:41,588
I don't need to go to this thing.

186
00:06:41,621 --> 00:06:44,290
- Go, have a good time.
- What, you're leaving?

187
00:06:44,323 --> 00:06:46,089
- Yeah.
- No, come on, Richie.

188
00:06:46,122 --> 00:06:47,889
Get back in the car.

189
00:06:47,922 --> 00:06:49,691
Richie!

190
00:06:49,724 --> 00:06:52,397
I'm not gonna follow
you. We're already late.

191
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,501
Don't. I'll be fine.

192
00:06:58,269 --> 00:07:00,036
Shit.

193
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:07,647
Listen, I had the shop make
up some options for the tables.

194
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,447
- We have a plumbing issue.
- I know.

195
00:07:09,488 --> 00:07:11,256
I got a backed up prep sink over here.

196
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:12,824
I called the plumbers.
They're on their way.

197
00:07:12,857 --> 00:07:14,992
You know, I also was thinking

198
00:07:15,025 --> 00:07:17,193
maybe we should paint these columns.

199
00:07:17,226 --> 00:07:19,065
Well, then it will smell like paint.

200
00:07:19,098 --> 00:07:22,062
Well, I can get some industrial
fans in here for over night.

201
00:07:22,095 --> 00:07:23,199
It's not worth it.

202
00:07:23,231 --> 00:07:25,831
We need to deal with
basic kitchen function,

203
00:07:25,864 --> 00:07:27,240
and getting word out, and...

204
00:07:27,305 --> 00:07:28,441
Well, then, if you could just make a call

205
00:07:28,474 --> 00:07:30,578
- on the flowers.
- Flowers? Jesus, Lynn.

206
00:07:30,611 --> 00:07:31,842
Are you listening?

207
00:07:33,547 --> 00:07:35,480
I'm sorry.

208
00:07:35,513 --> 00:07:36,712
- It's just...
- No, no, no, I'll...

209
00:07:36,745 --> 00:07:38,184
You know, I'll leave the flowers here

210
00:07:38,217 --> 00:07:40,585
and then whenever's a good time,

211
00:07:40,618 --> 00:07:42,354
you can...

212
00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:44,723
Okay.

213
00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:51,668
So you think it was food poisoning?

214
00:07:51,701 --> 00:07:55,132
Yeah, um, or something like that.

215
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:59,279
He actually started to
feel a little bit better,

216
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,482
but I told him it wasn't
worth it to risk it.

217
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:04,080
No, not if it was food poisoning.

218
00:08:04,113 --> 00:08:06,117
Mm-hmm, it's a bummer too

219
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,609
because he was totally excited to...

220
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:11,050
meet you and Dad and Megan.

221
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:13,051
Oh, she's going to be disappointed.

222
00:08:13,084 --> 00:08:15,124
Okay.

223
00:08:15,157 --> 00:08:17,428
I am not going to get
upset about this grass.

224
00:08:17,461 --> 00:08:21,193
The Langels have already
made a comment about it.

225
00:08:21,226 --> 00:08:23,527
Well, the Langels make a
comment about everything.

226
00:08:23,592 --> 00:08:25,062
Hmm, apparently,

227
00:08:25,095 --> 00:08:27,063
the church gardener is being treated

228
00:08:27,096 --> 00:08:28,729
for prostate cancer,

229
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:32,276
but it's just going to look
terrible in the pictures.

230
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:33,941
Well, this church needs to
get it's priorities straight.

231
00:08:33,974 --> 00:08:35,610
Don't they know this is a Murray wedding?

232
00:08:35,643 --> 00:08:38,208
What the hell's he doing here?

233
00:08:38,241 --> 00:08:40,039
Who's that?

234
00:08:40,079 --> 00:08:41,677
Is that Richie?

235
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,780
No.

236
00:08:43,813 --> 00:08:44,981
Hi.

237
00:08:45,014 --> 00:08:47,079
Hey.

238
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,086
Kevin, this is my mom, Danna.

239
00:08:50,119 --> 00:08:51,517
- Hey, mom.
- Hello.

240
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,484
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

241
00:08:53,516 --> 00:08:55,185
Okay, eyes right here, guys.

242
00:08:55,218 --> 00:08:56,719
Good.

243
00:08:56,752 --> 00:08:58,751
- This is so crazy.
- Yeah, this is really strange.

244
00:08:58,784 --> 00:09:00,255
I just thought it was weird

245
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:01,626
we both had weddings on the same weekend,

246
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:03,860
but you had your
sister's. And we had Gus's.

247
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:06,562
- Yeah, and Gus and Jon... ?
- Used to be lovers.

248
00:09:06,595 --> 00:09:08,727
- What?
- Yeah, it's a big secret.

249
00:09:08,768 --> 00:09:11,398
- I'm joking. They're best buds...
- God, you can't say that.

250
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:12,832
I can do what I want. Best
buddies from Dartmouth.

251
00:09:12,873 --> 00:09:14,337
But I only met Gus the other week.

252
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,473
Really? He's very sweet.

253
00:09:15,506 --> 00:09:17,507
- He's always... isn't he sweet?
- Yeah.

254
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,378
So where's Richie?

255
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,576
He, um...

256
00:09:23,617 --> 00:09:25,447
I...

257
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,318
I kind of fucked up.

258
00:09:27,351 --> 00:09:28,981
- Ooh.
- Yeah, in a big way.

259
00:09:29,014 --> 00:09:30,253
Hmm.

260
00:09:30,286 --> 00:09:31,381
Well, I'm glad you're here.

261
00:09:31,422 --> 00:09:32,820
It's good to see a friendly face.

262
00:09:32,853 --> 00:09:33,956
Yeah, it's good to see you too.

263
00:09:33,989 --> 00:09:35,989
- Yeah.
- Hey, Patty.

264
00:09:36,054 --> 00:09:39,031
Will you please come take
a photo with the bride?

265
00:09:39,064 --> 00:09:41,431
Will you excuse me? I'm gonna
go take some pictures now.

266
00:09:41,464 --> 00:09:43,094
No, no, hang on. Hang on a second.

267
00:09:43,135 --> 00:09:44,502
- This is not gonna work for the bowtie, is it?
- Oh, right.

268
00:09:44,535 --> 00:09:45,702
Can you do this?

269
00:09:45,735 --> 00:09:48,134
- Yeah.
- Okay, everyone, right here.

270
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:50,501
Family.

271
00:09:50,534 --> 00:09:52,710
- It can mess with your head, can't it?
- Yeah.

272
00:09:52,743 --> 00:09:55,247
Whenever I go home,

273
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,183
I just regress to being 14 again.

274
00:09:58,216 --> 00:10:00,617
I stay in my room, sulking,

275
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,617
playing Tetris.

276
00:10:03,658 --> 00:10:06,394
Ooh, slick as fuck.

277
00:10:06,427 --> 00:10:08,857
- You're a lifesaver.
- Yeah, go get 'em.

278
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:11,361
All right. I'm here.

279
00:10:11,394 --> 00:10:12,729
Sorry.

280
00:10:12,762 --> 00:10:15,369
- Can I get that...
- Glad to see you could finally make it.

281
00:10:15,402 --> 00:10:16,897
Yeah, Dad, good to see you too.

282
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,266
Can we get the brother to line up

283
00:10:18,307 --> 00:10:19,634
- with the other groomsmen there?
- Oh, yeah right.

284
00:10:19,675 --> 00:10:20,841
- Back here?
- Yeah.

285
00:10:20,874 --> 00:10:22,367
- Just step back over there.
- Sure.

286
00:10:22,408 --> 00:10:23,837
- All right, can you see me?
- Yeah.

287
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,309
If I can see you, you
should be able to see me.

288
00:10:26,342 --> 00:10:28,543
- Okay.
- All right.

289
00:10:28,576 --> 00:10:30,313
Looking good.

290
00:10:30,346 --> 00:10:32,449
- A little bit I think. What if I check?
- Great.

291
00:10:32,482 --> 00:10:34,250
You got a bit red there.

292
00:10:34,283 --> 00:10:35,520
Everybody's happy? Yeah?

293
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,655
Come on, babe. We're almost there.

294
00:10:38,688 --> 00:10:41,126
So I called Pauline about the show.

295
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:43,294
- What?
- Could you slow down, baby?

296
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,462
Please. You're walking so fast.

297
00:10:45,495 --> 00:10:46,630
Thanks.

298
00:10:46,663 --> 00:10:48,398
I pulled out of the show.

299
00:10:48,431 --> 00:10:50,398
Yeah, right. What, just now?

300
00:10:50,431 --> 00:10:52,201
This morning.

301
00:10:54,275 --> 00:10:55,642
Are you serious?

302
00:10:55,675 --> 00:10:57,506
Yeah, you said you didn't want me

303
00:10:57,547 --> 00:10:58,377
showing the pictures anyway.

304
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,208
So I figured...

305
00:11:00,241 --> 00:11:01,808
I had to get you that gig.

306
00:11:01,849 --> 00:11:03,448
I begged Pauline to let you in.

307
00:11:03,481 --> 00:11:05,184
- What, you...
- Wait, wait, wait. What are you doing?

308
00:11:05,217 --> 00:11:06,883
You said she asked you.

309
00:11:06,924 --> 00:11:07,988
Oh, yeah, well, she mentioned it.

310
00:11:08,021 --> 00:11:10,325
- Then I had to organize it.
- Begged her to... to what?

311
00:11:10,358 --> 00:11:11,955
To let your loser boyfriend

312
00:11:11,996 --> 00:11:14,530
- put up his fucking finger paintings on a wall?
- Calm down.

313
00:11:14,563 --> 00:11:16,760
You needed help. You were stuck.

314
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:18,560
All right, and I knew you weren't
gonna let me give you money.

315
00:11:18,593 --> 00:11:20,570
This is what you've been doing
since I moved in. Don't you see that?

316
00:11:20,603 --> 00:11:23,205
- What I've been doing?
- Yeah, I don't need you to fucking save me.

317
00:11:23,238 --> 00:11:26,646
I need you to... just be there for me.

318
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:28,780
Be there for you?

319
00:11:28,812 --> 00:11:30,904
I fucked a guy on camera
so that you could make art.

320
00:11:30,945 --> 00:11:32,407
- Does that not count for anything?
- Oh, come on.

321
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,639
I've seen the pictures, okay.

322
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,849
You didn't do that for me.

323
00:11:34,882 --> 00:11:36,817
This wasn't some charitable
art donation, okay.

324
00:11:36,851 --> 00:11:38,154
You were in fucking heaven.

325
00:11:38,187 --> 00:11:39,419
Holy fucking shit.

326
00:11:39,452 --> 00:11:41,658
- You're jealous that I got with CJ?
- No!

327
00:11:41,692 --> 00:11:43,288
I'm not jealous. That's
not what it's about.

328
00:11:43,322 --> 00:11:45,222
Can you even fucking hear
yourself? You set it up!

329
00:11:45,255 --> 00:11:46,357
That's not what it's about, okay.

330
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,452
Could you just listen to me?

331
00:11:47,485 --> 00:11:48,891
We're you just using him and me to get off?

332
00:11:48,924 --> 00:11:50,788
No, listen. I paid him.

333
00:11:56,797 --> 00:11:58,897
You paid him?

334
00:12:00,634 --> 00:12:02,633
You paid a whore to fuck me?

335
00:12:03,771 --> 00:12:05,637
How much?

336
00:12:07,176 --> 00:12:09,079
It's $220...

337
00:12:09,112 --> 00:12:11,245
an hour.

338
00:12:14,117 --> 00:12:16,579
You can't even pay rent.

339
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,620
I know. I know it's fucked up.

340
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:20,590
I've been nothing but
supportive of your shit,

341
00:12:20,623 --> 00:12:22,255
and you've been lying
to me since you moved in.

342
00:12:22,296 --> 00:12:23,960
I want to fucking tear
your eyes out right now.

343
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,327
I just...

344
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,796
Fucking asshole!

345
00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:29,859
So hit me. Hit me.

346
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,066
Hi, welcome. Have a seat.

347
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:33,932
- Eat your face off.
- That's perfect.

348
00:12:33,966 --> 00:12:35,102
- See?
- Awesome.

349
00:12:35,135 --> 00:12:36,943
It's like casual. You know what I'm after.

350
00:12:36,977 --> 00:12:38,241
Just be you, basically.

351
00:12:38,274 --> 00:12:39,880
So if I see a cockroach, I can scream?

352
00:12:39,913 --> 00:12:41,142
- You can scream.
- Wait a second.

353
00:12:41,175 --> 00:12:44,309
Dom, you're gonna be
out front as well, yes?

354
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,980
No, I'm gonna be in back.

355
00:12:46,013 --> 00:12:47,852
It's fine.

356
00:12:47,885 --> 00:12:50,023
Doris used to hostess
back in the day, right?

357
00:12:50,056 --> 00:12:51,720
Yeah, in high school, Marie Callender's.

358
00:12:51,761 --> 00:12:53,287
I was fired.

359
00:12:53,328 --> 00:12:55,726
I'm... I'm sorry, but
I think that's a mistake.

360
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:57,094
You need to be out front.

361
00:12:57,127 --> 00:12:58,758
Okay, hold on. Guys!

362
00:12:58,798 --> 00:13:00,725
How many times? What did I say?

363
00:13:00,765 --> 00:13:02,028
I said communal, right?

364
00:13:02,061 --> 00:13:04,396
So that means no two-tops,

365
00:13:04,429 --> 00:13:06,164
no four-tops.

366
00:13:06,205 --> 00:13:07,932
Just like this, and like this,

367
00:13:07,973 --> 00:13:10,604
and like this, all right? A moment outside?

368
00:13:15,909 --> 00:13:18,443
All right, kids, move the tables.

369
00:13:20,852 --> 00:13:23,787
Part of what we're selling here is you.

370
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,355
You're the main attraction.

371
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,892
And Taj too, of course,

372
00:13:27,925 --> 00:13:29,558
but he's got to stay back there

373
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:31,560
or no one gets to eat.

374
00:13:31,601 --> 00:13:34,265
Look, you know I appreciate
your funding this.

375
00:13:34,298 --> 00:13:36,305
- Funding?
- But when it comes to how it's run,

376
00:13:36,338 --> 00:13:38,903
I don't need you taking care of me

377
00:13:38,936 --> 00:13:41,671
and watching over me
like I'm some teenager.

378
00:13:41,704 --> 00:13:44,240
- Teenager, huh?
- Yeah.

379
00:13:44,273 --> 00:13:46,408
Hmm, hadn't thought of it like that,

380
00:13:46,449 --> 00:13:47,976
but now that you say it...

381
00:13:49,186 --> 00:13:50,881
Here are the keys to the car, son.

382
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,354
- Don't stay out too late.
- Oh, come on.

383
00:13:52,387 --> 00:13:54,221
Lynn, I didn't say I wanted you to leave...

384
00:13:54,262 --> 00:13:56,557
I am your partner in...

385
00:13:59,133 --> 00:14:00,364
in this.

386
00:14:00,397 --> 00:14:02,299
Or is there something
else that's on your mind?

387
00:14:02,332 --> 00:14:04,434
Are you angry with me?

388
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,941
Okay.

389
00:14:08,066 --> 00:14:11,033
Look, um, you're right.

390
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:13,073
Tomorrow is yours,

391
00:14:13,107 --> 00:14:16,010
so I'm gonna go.

392
00:14:16,043 --> 00:14:18,275
- You need to do what you need to do.
- Come on.

393
00:14:18,307 --> 00:14:19,748
- No, it's okay.
- Come on.

394
00:14:19,781 --> 00:14:21,245
You just...

395
00:14:21,286 --> 00:14:23,453
Lynn.

396
00:14:24,986 --> 00:14:26,653
You see that guy over there?

397
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,524
The hot jock gone to seed?

398
00:14:29,557 --> 00:14:31,524
Yeah, that's Cody Heller.

399
00:14:31,557 --> 00:14:33,228
He's cute.

400
00:14:33,261 --> 00:14:34,660
I grew up across the street from him.

401
00:14:34,693 --> 00:14:36,332
Our dads are best friends.

402
00:14:36,365 --> 00:14:38,196
And when we were home,
he was always really cool.

403
00:14:38,229 --> 00:14:40,667
But then at school, he
would completely ignore me.

404
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,971
Total... cunt.

405
00:14:44,741 --> 00:14:46,236
Ooh, that word sounds really weird

406
00:14:46,277 --> 00:14:47,476
coming out of your mouth.

407
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:48,612
You say it all the time.

408
00:14:48,645 --> 00:14:50,706
Yeah, but I'm English. We can make it work.

409
00:14:50,747 --> 00:14:52,345
Really? That's like a rule?

410
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:54,450
- It's not a rule. It's a fact.
- You can say it, though.

411
00:14:54,483 --> 00:14:55,546
Okay, okay.

412
00:14:55,579 --> 00:14:58,116
So, um, I'm making Jon propose to you.

413
00:14:58,189 --> 00:14:59,389
- Wow.
- Yeah.

414
00:14:59,422 --> 00:15:01,621
Uh, mainly because I've
not been to a gay wedding

415
00:15:01,654 --> 00:15:03,324
and that needs to happen yesterday.

416
00:15:03,356 --> 00:15:05,624
- So...
- Don't worry. I told her

417
00:15:05,657 --> 00:15:07,791
we're still way too young and
dangerous for that to happen.

418
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,023
Correct.

419
00:15:09,056 --> 00:15:11,498
Come on, don't you want
to snatch this guy up?

420
00:15:11,531 --> 00:15:13,331
You guys are both really handsome?

421
00:15:13,365 --> 00:15:14,637
You should just...

422
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,974
Oh, yeah, yes.

423
00:15:17,007 --> 00:15:18,436
Maybe one day.

424
00:15:18,477 --> 00:15:20,569
Darling.

425
00:15:20,602 --> 00:15:23,303
And then Patrick could be the bridesmaid.

426
00:15:23,376 --> 00:15:25,238
Oh, wow, thank you. Very funny.

427
00:15:25,271 --> 00:15:27,113
I was thinking more the flower girl.

428
00:15:27,146 --> 00:15:28,780
Oh-ho, fuck you.

429
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,220
All right, flower girl.

430
00:15:30,253 --> 00:15:31,756
- I got to go.
- Okay.

431
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,226
Hey, what's up? It's me.

432
00:15:42,861 --> 00:15:44,734
Listen, I am really sorry about today.

433
00:15:44,767 --> 00:15:48,272
I could still come pick you up.

434
00:15:48,305 --> 00:15:50,209
We'd be back in time for cake...

435
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:53,479
which is totally not a cake.

436
00:15:53,512 --> 00:15:55,616
"Totally."

437
00:15:57,682 --> 00:15:59,650
I guess I'm feeling nervous.

438
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:01,619
I wonder why.

439
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,895
Call me if you want.

440
00:16:22,038 --> 00:16:24,709
At least it's out now.

441
00:16:24,743 --> 00:16:26,511
You know?

442
00:16:28,849 --> 00:16:30,952
You know, when I was with CJ,

443
00:16:30,986 --> 00:16:33,319
when he was on top of me...

444
00:16:33,352 --> 00:16:35,315
he was fucking me...

445
00:16:35,348 --> 00:16:37,817
I looked over at you, just outside of it,

446
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:41,018
and you were just... just watching me.

447
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,427
That's all we've become.

448
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,529
You over there.

449
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:56,803
Me just... trying to change it.

450
00:17:01,413 --> 00:17:03,642
I'm done. I just...

451
00:17:03,675 --> 00:17:05,482
You got to get your shit out.

452
00:17:05,515 --> 00:17:06,978
My shit?

453
00:17:07,011 --> 00:17:09,715
All of it.

454
00:17:09,748 --> 00:17:12,123
I don't want to live with you anymore.

455
00:17:25,736 --> 00:17:27,639
Before we all dig in here,

456
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:28,607
I just want to, first of all,

457
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,877
thank all of you for coming.

458
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:35,177
And a little toast to our lovely Megan,

459
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:38,714
our not so very little Megan,

460
00:17:38,747 --> 00:17:41,283
- but I remember when you were little.
- Oh yeah?

461
00:17:42,588 --> 00:17:45,122
Like the time you would
take your brother there

462
00:17:45,155 --> 00:17:47,688
and dress him up as the Little Mermaid

463
00:17:47,721 --> 00:17:51,453
and then drag him through the
mall with all your girlfriends.

464
00:17:53,557 --> 00:17:56,696
It's hard to believe you're
that same little girl.

465
00:17:56,729 --> 00:17:58,561
But, uh...

466
00:17:58,602 --> 00:18:02,337
we particularly like the
choice you've made here in Gus.

467
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:05,198
The good thing about
it... Gus loves to golf,

468
00:18:05,239 --> 00:18:06,838
so I've got someone I can take

469
00:18:06,871 --> 00:18:08,672
to the invitational with me every year.

470
00:18:10,274 --> 00:18:12,577
And the really nice thing about it is

471
00:18:12,611 --> 00:18:14,218
he has his own money.

472
00:18:14,251 --> 00:18:17,049
So thank you, Silicon Valley.

473
00:18:17,082 --> 00:18:19,214
Cheers.

474
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,133
Hey.

475
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,403
You okay?

476
00:19:13,436 --> 00:19:15,299
I just needed some air.

477
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,279
Yeah, me too.

478
00:19:20,851 --> 00:19:23,047
Oh, the chicken was dry.

479
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,349
Good thing you didn't have the chicken.

480
00:19:25,382 --> 00:19:28,949
Yeah, I know. The salmon was pretty good.

481
00:19:33,224 --> 00:19:35,663
So I'm sorry you didn't
get to meet Richie tonight.

482
00:19:35,698 --> 00:19:37,731
Yes, that was a shame.

483
00:19:40,772 --> 00:19:42,075
Would've been the first time

484
00:19:42,108 --> 00:19:43,370
you've ever met a boyfriend of mine.

485
00:19:43,403 --> 00:19:45,273
I know, yes.

486
00:19:47,546 --> 00:19:50,578
And I hope he's feeling better now.

487
00:19:53,582 --> 00:19:57,083
I don't know. I think maybe you
should feel a little relieved.

488
00:19:58,419 --> 00:20:00,984
I don't think you'd
really like him very much.

489
00:20:01,024 --> 00:20:03,889
And how do you know that?

490
00:20:05,899 --> 00:20:08,898
Well, he's...

491
00:20:08,931 --> 00:20:11,833
Mexican first of all.

492
00:20:11,866 --> 00:20:13,800
All right.

493
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:16,903
And he doesn't really have any money.

494
00:20:16,936 --> 00:20:20,010
Well, neither did your
father when I met him.

495
00:20:20,043 --> 00:20:22,516
He was getting his Masters.

496
00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:24,413
Yeah, well...

497
00:20:24,453 --> 00:20:26,451
Richie's not going to
college any time soon.

498
00:20:26,484 --> 00:20:31,351
He cuts hair in shitty barber shop

499
00:20:31,385 --> 00:20:36,060
and he has no real ambition
to do other than just that

500
00:20:36,093 --> 00:20:39,504
and play the bass guitar.

501
00:20:39,537 --> 00:20:41,303
Sounds like a real catch.

502
00:20:41,336 --> 00:20:43,333
Yeah.

503
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:46,651
I knew that's how you'd feel.

504
00:20:46,685 --> 00:20:49,587
Well, now how do you expect me to respond

505
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,056
- after a description like that?
- You know,

506
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,359
you're the real reason
he's not here tonight.

507
00:20:53,449 --> 00:20:55,914
Richie's not sick.

508
00:20:55,979 --> 00:20:58,016
I was a jerk to him today

509
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:01,350
because I was so nervous
about introducing him to you

510
00:21:01,383 --> 00:21:03,950
because I know he's not the kind
of person you want me to be with.

511
00:21:03,991 --> 00:21:07,391
And what kind of person is that?

512
00:21:07,424 --> 00:21:10,632
Someone like Kevin or Jon.

513
00:21:10,665 --> 00:21:13,165
And what's wrong with that.

514
00:21:13,198 --> 00:21:15,362
They seem lovely.

515
00:21:15,427 --> 00:21:18,063
They seem just like you.

516
00:21:20,065 --> 00:21:22,265
You don't get it, do you, Mom?

517
00:21:23,202 --> 00:21:25,203
Everyone I'm ever with,

518
00:21:25,236 --> 00:21:27,507
every guy I've ever been on a date with,

519
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,976
I judge him based on what
you're gonna think of him.

520
00:21:30,009 --> 00:21:31,504
And it's really fucking me up.

521
00:21:32,873 --> 00:21:34,977
I see.

522
00:21:37,618 --> 00:21:39,553
Patrick.

523
00:21:40,851 --> 00:21:44,027
I know I don't say everything

524
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,659
you'd like me to say all the time...

525
00:21:48,532 --> 00:21:50,531
and I know I had problems

526
00:21:51,733 --> 00:21:54,065
when you first told us.

527
00:21:55,937 --> 00:21:58,270
But I've come a long way.

528
00:21:58,303 --> 00:22:02,471
And I can't help wanting
what's best for you.

529
00:22:04,507 --> 00:22:07,513
And I don't think you
can blame me for Richie.

530
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,615
If he's not here...

531
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:14,213
that's on you, sweetie.

532
00:22:18,723 --> 00:22:21,929
Is that a pot cookie?

533
00:22:21,962 --> 00:22:26,760
Well, it's actually a
marshmallow krispie treat.

534
00:22:28,535 --> 00:22:30,400
It's legal now in Colorado.

535
00:22:32,234 --> 00:22:34,737
Oh, you want some?

536
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,143
No, Mom.

537
00:22:37,176 --> 00:22:40,039
It really helps since
I went off the Lexapro.

538
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:41,846
I didn't know you were on Lexapro.

539
00:22:41,879 --> 00:22:44,446
Well, Patrick,

540
00:22:44,479 --> 00:22:47,218
if you asked me how I was
doing every now and then,

541
00:22:47,251 --> 00:22:49,890
you'd know.

542
00:23:02,939 --> 00:23:05,673
Franklin?

543
00:23:10,074 --> 00:23:12,113
Frank?

544
00:23:16,449 --> 00:23:18,680
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

545
00:23:18,721 --> 00:23:21,784
- You okay?
- Yeah.

546
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:24,321
I'm super.

547
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:28,058
- What's happened?
- Oh, nothing.

548
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:30,226
Just today.

549
00:23:30,267 --> 00:23:32,466
I used to like weddings.

550
00:23:34,834 --> 00:23:36,630
- Jon's drunk.
- Oh, great.

551
00:23:36,663 --> 00:23:40,334
Yeah, no, I can't stand
him when he's drunk.

552
00:23:41,702 --> 00:23:43,405
Are you a little bit drunk?

553
00:23:44,574 --> 00:23:46,037
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.

554
00:23:46,078 --> 00:23:50,781
But, see, I'm a nice drunk.

555
00:23:50,814 --> 00:23:53,482
Yeah, that's good to know.

556
00:23:55,316 --> 00:23:57,188
What?

557
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:01,492
I was gonna kiss you.

558
00:24:01,557 --> 00:24:03,157
What?

559
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,661
I'm kidding.

560
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:05,862
Okay, 'cause that would be wei...

561
00:24:35,386 --> 00:24:37,622
So what do you think?

562
00:24:37,655 --> 00:24:39,454
Can I pull this off?

563
00:24:39,487 --> 00:24:42,161
I think it is going to be

564
00:24:42,194 --> 00:24:45,730
the finest night for all these
foodie fuckers in this town.

565
00:24:45,763 --> 00:24:47,002
Are you kidding?

566
00:24:47,035 --> 00:24:50,431
But it ain't gonna happen
without help, darling.

567
00:24:53,072 --> 00:24:55,271
Okay, are you hearing me?

568
00:24:56,945 --> 00:24:59,114
'Cause some people really
do just want to help.

569
00:25:03,512 --> 00:25:05,047
Those are my favorite.

570
00:25:17,394 --> 00:25:19,329
Hey.

571
00:25:26,307 --> 00:25:28,709
40 grand for this.

572
00:25:31,719 --> 00:25:33,286
You're, uh...

573
00:25:34,623 --> 00:25:37,021
you're not gonna want
one of these, are you?
