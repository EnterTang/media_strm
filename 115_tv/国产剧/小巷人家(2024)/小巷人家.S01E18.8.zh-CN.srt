1
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,360
尼克  你的客人正在厕所里撒尿
Nick! Your house guest is urinating in the bathroom

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,700
还一身托尼虎的装扮[美国经典卡通人物]
Tony the Tiger style.

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,550
-全裸只戴了方巾吗  -什么
- Naked with a kerchief? - What?

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,740
全身赤裸  只戴一块方巾吗
Naked with a kerchief.

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,890
不  上身穿衣  下面光光该怎么形容
No, what do you call top, no pants?

6
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,230
就像维尼小熊  或是帕丁顿熊
Oh ,that's like a Winnie the Pooh or a Paddington.

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,630
美味脆上的那只青蛙
Honey the Smacks Frog.

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:22,230
还有唐老鸭
There's a Donald the Duck.

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,690
几乎所有熊都这身打扮  除了瑜伽熊
I guess pretty much any kind of bear except for Yogi

10
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,380
它是全裸只系了条领带
'cause that's naked with a tie.

11
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,690
阿尔文  西蒙  西奥多[均为卡通熊的名字]
Alvin, Simon, Theodore.

12
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,260
他的屁股一览无遗
I saw his entire butt.

13
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,940
听着  迪克是个好人
Look, Dirk's a good guy.

14
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,920
他是我读法学院时的室友
He was my roommate when I was in law school.

15
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,100
我所知的头号智者
Smartest guy I know.

16
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:34,770
这么说  他是个律师咯
So, he's a lawyer?

17
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,180
不  他不是  但他有法学学位
No, he's not a lawyer, but he does have a law degree,

18
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,330
有商学学位  甚至还是农学硕士
a business degree, and a master's in agriculture.

19
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,390
他就像个文凭收藏家似的
He's kind of like a degree collector.

20
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,020
他还是个诗歌博士呢
He's got his PhD in poetry, so...

21
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,940
诗歌界真是倒霉催的
That sucks for poems.

22
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,260
你和那高富帅进展如何
How'd it go with Fancyman?

23
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,330
初次约会可理想了
It was an amazing first date,

24
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,770
虽然最后有点小尴尬
except for one awkward part at the end.

25
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,480
我不常约会的
I don't go on dates very often.

26
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,110
我这年龄段的男人都一心只想跳过约会
Guys my age always want to skip the date

27
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,500
直接伸手捞金
and just go right for the gold,

28
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,200
我可不轻易让他们得逞
which I don't give them

29
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,560
我守着金子一毛不拔
because I'm stingy with my gold.

30
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,360
除非他们亲自动手挖
Unless they dig for it.

31
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:11,100
我都还没说到尴尬的部分呢
I haven't even gotten to the awkward part yet.

32
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:20,720
黑色轿车吗
Black sedan?

33
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,310
是
Uh, yeah.

34
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,130
搞什么
What?

35
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,780
他就这么拍了拍我的背
So, he patted me on the back.

36
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,670
我还觉得好歹袭个胸呢
I thought I'd at least get a front pat.

37
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,800
啥
What?

38
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,090
听着  他可能只是太紧张
Look, he probably just got nervous.

39
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,830
不  拉塞尔从来不紧张
No, Russell's never nervous.

40
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,460
这是最不可能的答案
That's the worst answer.

41
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,440
温斯顿  你怎么看
Winston, what do you think?

42
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,690
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

43
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:40,700
什么事  宝贝
Hey, what's up, baby?

44
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,550
是不是谢尔比的电话
Hey, is that Shelby?

45
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,550
-你这是干啥  -学猫叫
- What was that? - That was a cat sound.

46
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,220
你模仿抽鞭子的声音  我们配合
Oh, because you did the whip, we should've...

47
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,460
-伙计们  -大概还有其他配合方法
- Guys! - It should have been the other way around.

48
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,230
好吧  我去问希希
Okay, I'm just gonna ask Cece.

49
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,010
下次你们要是想征求关于泡妞的建议
But next time you guys want advice about girls,

50
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,720
可别来求我
don't come crawling to me.

51
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,860
-没问题  -听上去可行
- You got it. - That sounds good.

52
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,400
不  我开玩笑的
No, that was a joke.

53
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,970
我超享受你们问我事情
I love it when you guys ask me stuff.

54
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,320
让我觉得自己很有分量
It makes me feel really important.

55
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,170
我可享受了
And I love it...

56
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,090
"光明消逝  暗影蔓延"
"One shade the more, One ray the less."

57
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,540
"逐渐侵蚀这难言的美"
"Had half impaired the nameless grace."

58
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,920
你系的是女式围巾吗
Are you wearing a ladies' scarf?

59
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,070
明晚来听我的讲座吧
Come to my lecture tomorrow night.

60
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,780
绝对不去
Absolutely not.

61
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,320
她不会去的  兄弟
She's missing out, my man.

62
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,440
-施密特  -什么事
- Hey, Schmidt? - Yeah?

63
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,800
我能借下你的车送谢尔比去机场吗
Mind if I borrow your car to take Shelby to the airport?

64
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,910
我可没有"车"  温斯顿
I don't have a car, Winston.

65
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,690
施密特  我能借下你的
Hey, Schmidt, uh, you mind if I use the, uh,

66
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,160
"兄护车"吗
"Man-bulance"?

67
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,510
兄护车正处在保养期呢  
The man-bulance is resting.

68
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,090
为周一那场团队合作修行作准备
He needs to get ready for the corporate team-building retreat on Monday.

69
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,160
没关系  反正你那兄护车也装不下
That's cool. I'm sure the man-bulance couldn't handle

70
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,280
谢尔比的行李
all of Shelby's luggage anyway.

71
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,260
你脑子还正常吗  温斯顿
What the hell is wrong with you, Winston?

72
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,900
就算谢尔比的行李翻个九倍也装得下
The man-bulance could fit the luggage of nine Shelbys.

73
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,840
装下一千个谢尔比都没问题
It has the towing capacity of a thousand Shelbys.

74
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,060
你拿去用吧  温斯顿
You know what? Here you go, Winston.

75
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:40,850
给你
There you go.

76
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:41,670
享受这奢侈品吧
Enjoy luxury.

77
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,990
不用  伙计  我有你的备份钥匙  谢了
All good, man. I got your second set, so thank you.

78
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,600
你怎么会有我的备份钥匙
How'd you get my second set of keys?

79
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,040
是谁忘了关门
Hey, someone left your door open.

80
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,150
是谁造就你容颜倾城
Someone left your face beautiful.

81
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,320
这是谁
Who is that?

82
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,920
他叫迪克
Apparently, his name is Dirk.

83
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,590
抱歉  迪克  我名花有主了
Sorry, Dirk, I'm seeing somebody.

84
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,590
但你仍有幸一睹这个
But should that stop you from seeing this?

85
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,670
是啊  帅爆了
Yeah! That's awesome.

86
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,490
和他一起开心吗
Does he keep you happy?

87
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,620
他唯命是从
He does what he's told.

88
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:09,290
这么说  你是老板  他是你的小秘书咯
So you're the boss and he's your little secretary?

89
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,270
你是"咪书"还差不多
You're a sex-cretary?

90
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,260
我毫无疑问  绝对老板型
I am definitely the boss.

91
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,090
"咪书"  这词是他刚即兴编的
Sex-cretary, he just made that up.

92
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,070
我讨厌参加单身告别派对
I hate bachelorette parties.

93
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,530
我行李里装了大概50种鸡鸡
I have, like 50 different penis items in my carry-on.

94
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,740
要是坠机了
This plane goes down,

95
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,450
海里的鲨鱼就要做一些奇怪的事了
there's gonna be some sharks doing some really weird stuff.

96
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,910
鲨鱼  你不是去维加斯嘛
Sharks? I thought you were going to Vegas?

97
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,250
不  我去墨西哥  我记得跟你讲过
No, I'm going to Mexico. I thought I told you that.

98
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,540
如果你不希望我去
Well, if you don't want me to go,

99
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,890
我就不去
I don't have to go.

100
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,950
不不不  不不  我希望你去
No, no, no, no, no, no, I want you to go.

101
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:42,870
这样很好  懂吗
It'll be good, you know?

102
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,050
我们在一起黏乎了五个晚上
We spent the last five nights together.

103
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,890
我是说  分开点好  距离产生美嘛
I mean, you know, we both could use some space.

104
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,780
是啊
Right.

105
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,240
-我是不是说错啥了  -你说什么
- Did I say something wrong? - What?

106
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,110
抱歉  你离得太远我听不见
I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you across all the space.

107
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,650
好消息  杰茜在洗澡
Great news, um, Jess is taking a shower.

108
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,350
听着  我只需要  十分钟的私密好时光
Okay, I just need, like, a good, solid ten minutes.

109
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,450
先把这麦片能量棒吃了
Eat this granola bar first.

110
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,290
我们玩点新花样  "卧槽立马"式
I want to try something called the horse trough.

111
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,160
不  希希
No, Cece.

112
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,470
我现在没法跟你滚床单
I'm not having sex with you right now.

113
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,480
我要把公司所有员工的名字
I have to get everybody in the company's name

114
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,470
输进"不是我放的火"的名录里
into a version of "We Didn't Start the Fire."

115
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,240
没事你忙  需要多久  二十分钟够吗
Totally fine. What do you need, like, 20 minutes?

116
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,050
希希  这可是正经工作
Cece, this... Okay, this is real work

117
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,490
是我正经的上司派给我的
for my real boss who is not you.

118
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,520
我知道你在闹什么脾气了
Oh, I get what's happening here.

119
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:37,110
就因为马尾男管你叫"情欲招待"
It's 'cause Ponytail called you a "sex receptionist."

120
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,840
"情欲招待"一整天就只管接电话
A sex receptionist answers calls all day.

121
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,570
"咪书"至少能安排行程  整理文件
A sex-cretary does scheduling, light filing,

122
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,990
基本上是管整个办公室了
basically runs the office.

123
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,230
所以首先呢
So, first of all,

124
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,180
感谢你给我降职
thank you for the demotion.

125
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,010
其次  老子不干了
And second of all, I quit.

126
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:49,960
那行  晚上见
So, I'll see you tonight.

127
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,810
你是把我说的当耳旁风吗
Did you not hear anything I just said?

128
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:55,180
没啊  你说的每个字我都听得清清楚楚
Oh, no, I totally heard you loud and clear, but

129
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,040
不过有俩小淘气碰巧没听到呢
do you know who didn't happen to hear you?

130
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,290
你这是在干嘛
What are you doing?

131
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,280
别把它俩扯进来
Don't-don't-don't involve them.

132
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,600
我了个去
Oh, my...

133
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,290
它俩真的没听到
They just didn't hear.

134
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,350
别把它俩扯进来
Don't bring them into this.

135
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,200
别跟我说
Don't tell me.

136
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,720
跟它俩说去
Tell them.

137
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,850
妈的
Damn it.

138
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,440
那谁  哈罗德  库玛
I guess, uh, Harold, Kumar,

139
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,620
我爱...  爱死你俩了
I love... I love you both.

140
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,770
那些一同嬉戏的美好时光啊
All the zany adventures we've had.

141
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,860
但我今天不能与你俩共赴巫山了
But we can't go to White Castle today.

142
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,150
实在无能为力
Just can't do it.

143
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,050
你是跟我来真的啊
You're serious about this?

144
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:28,960
希希
Cece?

145
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,510
施密特是不是在骚扰你
Is Schmidt bothering you?

146
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,370
这事儿没完
This is not over. Okay?

147
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,480
他那是爱抚  还是轻拍
Was it like a caress or like a... like a pat?

148
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,670
不  是轻拍  是轻拍妥妥的
No, like a pat. It was distinctly a pat,

149
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,860
说起来那感觉还特撩人
and it was actually kind of hot.

150
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,050
这男人轻拍技术了得
The man knows how to pat a back.

151
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,770
你那晚是不是又模仿克米特青蛙了
At any point during the night, did you do your Kermit the Frog imitation?
着名卡通木偶青蛙

152
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,360
可能吧
Maybe.

153
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,370
就一两次
Once or twice.

154
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,600
别  打住  我听你学一次疯一次
No, stop, it freaks me out and you know.

155
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,220
我到底该怎么办
Well, what do I do?

156
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,690
我真的  很想再见到他  发自肺腑的
I really, really want to see him again, like, badly.

157
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,810
-那就给他打电话  -我办不到
- You just call him. - I can't.

158
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:55,990
他那么成熟老练
He's too sophisticated.

159
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,630
他跟我说他和公牛赛跑过
He told me he'd run with the bulls,

160
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,800
他原话是
and I quote,

161
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,050
"可不是潘普洛纳那供逗游客乐的公牛"[西班牙城市]
"Not the touristy bulls in Pamplona."

162
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,910
什么大不了的  快打给他
Big deal. Just call him.

163
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,490
施密特说  只要女人拿起手机把郎盼
Schmidt says the moment a woman touches a phone,

164
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,580
神韵魅力就消散  除非是在发情色短信
she loses her power unless she's sexting,

165
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,450
那样的话  魅力立马回一半
in which case, she gains a half power.

166
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,100
那又怎样  刚施密特还说
Okay, well, that's Schmidt just talking...

167
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,320
我是说  施密特懂个屁
I mean, what does Schmidt know?

168
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,000
你看看你生活圈里的人  一群小男生
Look, all the guys that you live with-- boys.

169
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,620
你只跟小男生交往过
You've only dated boys.

170
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,180
拉塞尔是一个成熟的男人
Russell is a grown man,

171
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,130
我打赌他喜欢那种
and I bet he likes women

172
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,410
知道自己要什么并主动争取的女人
who know what they want and ask for it.

173
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,980
他有个热气球  放在棕泉市的飞机棚里
He has a hot air balloon in a hangar in Palm Springs.

174
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,450
好了  亲爱的  你也可以成熟老练
Okay, sweetheart, you are sophisticated.

175
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,930
你所要做的就是拿起电话
You've just got to pick up the phone,

176
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,500
邀请他出来共进晚餐
and you ask him out for dinner.

177
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,300
你说得对  我也可以成熟老练
You know what? You're right. I am sophisticated.

178
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,720
我这就打给他
I'm gonna do this.

179
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,690
这是什么玩意
What is that?

180
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:38,140
是手机啊
It's a phone.

181
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,570
我的天
Oh, God.

182
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:45,750
如是  我们时光之旅到此结束了
And thus ends our journey through the words of time.

183
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,000
从迪伦·托马斯[英国诗人]到鲍勃·迪伦[美国诗人]
From Dylan Thomas to Bob Dylan,

184
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,270
始于迪伦  止于迪伦
from Dylan to Dylan.

185
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,780
俩人都叫迪伦
They're both named Dylan.

186
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:53,790
好戏来了  老弟
Watch him bring it home, man.

187
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,630
我能不听吗
Do I have to?

188
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,350
"我们无法抑制怒火"
"We have to rage."

189
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,340
"盛怒于光的消逝"
"Rage against the dying of the light."

190
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,940
"若那光已  明亮不再"
"And when the light is no longer bright."

191
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:11,060
"切勿思量  万事安康"
"Don't think twice, it's all right."

192
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,550
到此结束
It's over.

193
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,090
太睿智了
Smartest guy I know.

194
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,970
教授
Professor?

195
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,360
-教授  -怎么了
- Professor? - Yeah?

196
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,470
我们就想提醒你一下
We wanted to remind you about

197
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,390
这演讲之后还有茶话会
the post-lecture wine and cheese event.

198
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,990
社交晚宴吗
A soiree, eh?

199
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,570
超级高端的哟
Super classy.

200
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,890
薄脆饼干  美酒蟹肉  鹰嘴豆泥
Crackers, bubbles, crab, hummus.

201
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:33,340
是啊  之前我有给您发邮件说过
Yeah, I-I e-mailed you about that. That was me.

202
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,600
每当我收到长篇累牍的电邮
Oh, sometimes when I get a really long e-mail...

203
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,200
我就索性不看了
I don't read it.

204
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,300
再见
Bye.

205
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,060
我的亲娘
Oh, Mommy.

206
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,730
好了  迪克  你和黛比怎样了
All right, Dirk, what about Deb?

207
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,470
还在闹别扭什么的吗
You guys having problems or something?

208
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,270
不不不  一切顺利
No, no, no, everything's fine.

209
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,690
她离开我  搬出去了
She left me and moved out of the house.

210
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:55,520
大概是因为"没法再支持我"了
I guess it was "Too hard to support me."

211
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,990
"经济问题"
"Financially."

212
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,940
不过没事  她的离去让我意识到
It's all fine; her leaving has allowed me to realize

213
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,870
一件我人生所失之憾
the one thing that was missing in my life.

214
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,620
围巾吗
Scarves?

215
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,850
女大学生们
Undergraduate ladies.

216
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,610
我们这年龄的女孩  她们想要什么
You see, girls our age, what do they want?

217
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,170
想结婚  想给孩子找个父亲
They want us to wed them, sire their children.

218
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,510
-希望你有个容身之处  -对  没错
- They want you to have a-a bedframe. - Right, yeah.

219
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,970
还希望你吃饭时把盘子舔干净
They want you to eat off plates,

220
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,210
但大学里的女孩们
but girls in college

221
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:14,360
她们只想听你夸奖
all they want you to do

222
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,000
自己的摄影作品拥有无限潜力
is tell them that their photography has potential.

223
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,030
没错  但她们应该更想和同龄小伙子约会吧
Yeah, but don't they want to hang out wth guys their own age?

224
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,820
你和20来岁的小男生混过吗
Have you hung out with a 20-year-old dude lately?

225
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,230
-相信我  他们各种无下限  -我信
- Trust me, they are setting the bar very, very low. - Right.

226
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,920
还处在时时想搞基的阶段呢
They haven't even gone through their gay phase yet.

227
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,390
伙计  我去给谢尔比打个电话
Hey, man, I'm gonna give Shelby a call really quick.

228
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,000
看看她是不是一切顺利
Just want to check on her, see if everything's all right.

229
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,680
祝你好运  兄弟
Sounds good, man.

230
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,130
什么啊  老兄  没事的好吗
What, dude, relax, okay?

231
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,930
我只是说应该保持点距离
I just said we're gonna give each other space,

232
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,200
不代表我不能给她打电话  对吗
doesn't mean I can't call her, right,

233
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,340
聊聊飞机上的趣闻啊什么的
to see if anything funny happened on the plane.

234
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,620
你懂"距离"的含义吗
You know what "Space" means, right?

235
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,640
就是让她去和别人滚床单
That's space to have sex with other people.

236
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,730
不对  距离的意思是  让她去墨西哥
No, space means you go to Mexico,

237
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,160
但不许和别人滚床单
and you do not have sex with other people.

238
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,000
看好了
Watch this.

239
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,870
尼克  来点亲密无间的
Nick, don't give my any space.

240
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,510
没问题
You got it, my man.

241
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,470
看见了吗  这样就几乎
See, this makes it pretty hard

242
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,140
把咱俩上床的可能性降为零了  对吗
for you and I to have sex right now, doesn't it?

243
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,090
现在  尼克  和我保持距离
Now, Nick, I want you to give me some space.

244
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:57,830
没问题
You got it.

245
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,680
有了距离之后
All this space allows me opportunity

246
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,470
想咋上床就咋整了
to have as much sex as we want.

247
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,310
太聪明了
Smartest guy I know.

248
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,880
想想我们现在能打多少炮
See how much sex we could be having?

249
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,400
那  那真是
That-that does...

250
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,230
离我远点  你这书呆子
Get out of my way, bookworms!

251
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,620
准备好向学生妹们开炮了吗
You ready to make love to some college chicks?

252
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,710
你上次来一发是什么时候
When's the last time you had mono?

253
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,980
不记得了
I don't know.

254
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,870
等到明天  你就该回答是昨天了
Tomorrow, you're gonna say yesterday.

255
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,910
这是您要的团队建设调查  施密特先生
I have that team-building research you asked for, Mr. Schmidt.

256
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,220
你  穿的这是啥呀
What... are you wearing?

257
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,760
我也不知道
I don't... I don't know.

258
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,190
我在健身房的失物招领处捡到的
I mean, I found this at the lost and found at the gym.

259
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:34,010
我实在不清楚"咪书"该怎么性感
I'm not really sure how sexy a sex-cretary is supposed to be.

260
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,180
我以前从来不用费这神
I've never had to do this.

261
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,020
我从没刻意勾引过谁
I've never had to seduce somebody before.

262
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,240
如果你想勾引我
If you're gonna seduce me,

263
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,850
别打扮得像我弗里达姨妈在逾越节家宴上似的
don't dress up like my aunt Frieda at Seder.

264
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,730
来吧  好吗
Come on, okay?

265
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:48,190
地点  体位  全部悉听尊便
I will do anything, and I'll do it anywhere.

266
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,340
行吗
All right?

267
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,780
就算去三号幻想地点
Even fantasy location...

268
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,560
也行吗
number three?

269
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,730
好吧
Okay.

270
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,330
甲壳虫乐队怎样
How good are the Beatles?

271
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,660
甲壳虫是最棒的
Beatles are the best.

272
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,000
他们解散的时候你一定很失落吧
Were you so upset when they broke up?

273
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,170
我本会伤心至今的  那时我孤身一人
I would have been, but I was one.

274
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,720
你现在可不再孤身了
Well, you're not one anymore.

275
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,320
你的前列腺还好吗
How's your prostate?

276
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,300
上个礼拜我检查了乳腺
I had my breast exam last week,

277
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,760
它们很好
and, like, they're fine.

278
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,610
就是胸部嘛
It's just boob in there,

279
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:24,780
但是我们该谨慎对待
but we have to be careful.

280
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,930
肉体可是在不断衰老的
Our bodies are decaying.

281
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,310
你还好吧
Are you okay?

282
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,380
看起来怪怪的
You seem strange.

283
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,190
那晚我们为什么没接吻
Why didn't we kiss the other night?

284
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,370
对不起
Sorry.

285
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,200
抱歉
I'm sorry.

286
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,610
没关系
No, it's fine.

287
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,310
-怎么了  -我...
- What? - Hey, I...

288
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,640
-还好吧  -我得走了
- Is everything okay? - Oh. I got to go.

289
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,420
-这些用来付饭钱  -好
- This ought to take care of the dinner. - Yeah.

290
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,900
好吗
Okay?

291
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,840
我居然差点忘了...
Oh, I cannot believe I almost left without, um...

292
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,350
这是打的钱
Here, there's cab fare.

293
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,250
注意安全
Get home safe.

294
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,060
宝贝  听着  我不想保持距离了  好吗
Baby, look, I don't want space, okay?

295
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,260
我们俩谁都不要保持距离
I don't want anyone to have space.

296
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,560
我就想站在你面前
I want to be standing right in front of you.

297
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,360
鼻间吸入之气
I want the air that you breathe

298
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,890
全是你呼出的芳香
to be the air coming directly from out of my mouth.

299
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,960
我想与你呼吸缠绵
I want to just be passing air back and forth

300
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,980
直到氧气全变成二氧化碳
between each other until it's mostly carbon dioxide

301
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,010
我俩一同昏死殉情
and then we both pass out and die.

302
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,020
今晚没有航班了
No flights tonight.

303
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,780
施密特  你介意我再借用一下你的车吗
Hey, Schmidt, do you mind if I borrow your car again?

304
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,230
"当然不了  温斯顿  你那么棒"
"Of course you can, Winston. You're so great."

305
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,140
谢谢
Thank you!

我叫尼克拉斯
Hey, my name's Nicholas.

311
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,100
尼克  尼克
Nick, Nick.

312
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,090
哥们  没人会后悔参加庆功宴
Buddy, nobody ever regretted throwing an after party.

313
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:50,980
不  我后悔了
Oh, I do.

314
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,070
迪克  我待这真显老
Dirk, I feel so old here.

315
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,780
现在叫女孩"小不点"还流行吗
Is calling a girl "Shorty" Still cool?

316
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,120
我们来挖掘一下你对女大学生的吸引力吧
We just got to find your angle with these college girls.

317
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,590
你的魅力  你勾搭妹子的才能
Your hook, your panty-melter.

318
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:01,290
我的魅力通常都是在打烊时间  只剩我在那
Usually, my hook is that it's closing time, and I'm there.

319
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,570
你可曾是法学院的勾搭人的招牌选手
You were a panty-melting icon in law school.

320
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,780
如果说妹子们的内内是雪人
If panties were snowmen,

321
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:08,360
你就是那三月的烈日  老兄

322
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,860
-别  别这样  -斯凯乐  蜜莉恩
- Don't-don't do this. - Skyler, Miriam,

323
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,250
-过来一下  -别让我丢脸了  迪克
- Come over here for a second. - Don't humiliate me, Dirk.

324
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,960
我朋友尼克有多帅
How cool is my friend, Nick?

325
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,630
你也是教授吗
Are you a professor, too?

326
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,290
不不不  我是个酒保
No, no, no, I'm a bartender.

327
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:20,210
三十岁
30 years old,

328
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,230
没有医疗保险
I don't have health insurance.

329
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,230
你会调酒吗
You know how to make drinks?

330
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,980
尽情勾搭吧
Panty-melter.

331
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,820
你是问我  会不会调饮料吗
Do I know how to make drinks, did you say?

332
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,710
没错  比如酒精类饮料
Yeah, like alcoholic drinks?

333
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,150
会啊  我可是专业级的
Yeah, I do that professionally.

334
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,320
你能用专业水准把我灌醉吗
You could get me drunk professionally?

335
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,810
你是警察吗
Are you a cop?

336
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:36,990
有时是
Sometimes.

337
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,990
你有带身份证明吗
Do you have identification on you?

338
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:48,950
我要给珍娜打个电话
I gotta call Jenna

339
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,470
告诉她我在和一个酒保亲热
and tell her I'm making out with a bartender.

340
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,390
一周五晚哦
Five nights a week.

341
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,310
杰茜  你来参加派对啦
Jess, you made it to the party!

342
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:57,030
发生什么了
What's going on?

343
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,010
为什么《社交网络》剧组跑我们家来了
Why is the cast of the Social Network in our apartment?

344
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,000
迪克就是个天才
Dirk is a genius!

345
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,700
二十岁的小姑娘  她们觉得我酷毙了
20-year-old girls-- they think I'm awesome!

346
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,210
你看她们
And look at 'em!

347
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:07,960
她们连《解救的钟声》都没听说过
They don't know what Saved by the Bell is
电视剧  1989年上映

348
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,950
真是少不更事
and they've never felt pain.

349
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,050
斯凯乐把我当高富帅
I'm Skyler's Fancyman!

350
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:13,970
你能相信吗
Can you believe it?

351
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,680
你的高富帅呢  他人呢
Where's your Fancyman? Where is he?

352
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,860
我不知道  情况太糟了
I don't know. It was horrible.

353
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,260
他提前离开  留下一百块钱
He left and gave me $100

354
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,270
给我打车用
for a cab!

355
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,700
你猜怎样
You know what?

356
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,960
我要用剩下的九十块
I'm gonna use the remaining 90

357
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,380
离开这儿  重新生活

358

认识你很高兴
It's been nice knowing you.

359

我要孤老终身了
I'm gonna die alone!

360
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,810
不
Oh, no!

361
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,490
我现在非常  非常悲伤
I am so, so sad right now.

362
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,370
我心都要碎了
My heart hurts!

363
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:41,460
要让尼克给你调杯杨梅微风吗
You want Nick to make you a bayberry breeze?

364
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,560
-因为他超聪明的  -超聪明
- 'Cause he is so smart. - So smart.

365
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,900
是的  我需要  非常需要
Yes, I do. Yes, I do!

366
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,710
给你
This.

367
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,250
老娘不爽  三十岁烂透了
I'm not happy! 30 sucks!

368
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,170
这样子真怪怪的
Weird party move.

369
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,260
都俩小时了
It's been two hours.

370
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,710
真是太疯狂了
This is officially crazy.

371
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:14,910
而且  我还想上厕所
Also, I have to go to the bathroom.

372
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,260
尿在身上好了
Just pee yourself.

373
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,020
所以你宁愿接下来一路都
So you'd rather sit in my urine

374
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:18,710
坐在我的小便上
for the rest of the car ride

375
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:21,270
也不愿向温斯顿承认我们俩上床了吗
than admit to Winston that we're sleeping together?

376
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,600
是的  没错  想都不用想
Yep, absolutely. Don't even have to think about it.

377
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,890
我不想破坏这份关系好吗
I don't want to ruin what we have, okay?

378
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,520
因为如果大家发现了
Because if people find out,

379
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,220
他们会问一堆问题
they're gonna have a lot of questions,

380
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:33,430
比如"希希  你为什么和他上床"
like, "Cece, why are you sleeping with him?"

381
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,920
"说真的  到底为毛啊"
And, "Seriously, why?"

382
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,300
你是说我们现在这关系值得维护吗
You think we have something to ruin?

383
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,660
之前  我打扮得像个"咪"书
Earlier, I was dressed as a sex-cretary.

384
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,290
还塞了垫肩
And I was wearing shoulder pads.

385
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,890
所以很显然
So I obviously

386
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,030
我喜欢和你上床
must like sleeping with you.

387
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,880
是秘"骚"
A secre-tarty.

388
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,200
讨厌
Shut... up.

389
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,260
这样感觉真好
This is pretty great.

390
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,180
顺便说句  我冻僵了
I'm freezing, by the way.

391
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,680
冷死了
I'm so cold.

392
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,280
你怎么会不冷的
How are you not freezing?

393
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,270
难道棕色皮肤能保温吗
Do your brown skin retain heat?

394
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:24,470
敞胸怀开喝  特雷弗
Take out your tampon and drink, Trevor!

395
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,190
翻杯女王发话了
The Flip Queen has spoken!

396
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,220
喝  喝  喝  喝  喝
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

397
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,450
喝  喝  喝  喝
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

398
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:34,940
谢尔比
Shelby.

399
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,870
宝贝  我不想保持距离了
Babe, I don't want space.

400
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,170
我也不要
Neither do I!

401
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,610
所以我去了你家
That's why I'm at your apartment.

402
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:42,650
我坐飞机回来了  我想见你
I got on a plane. I wanted to see you.

403
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,200
什么
What?!

404
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,920
宝贝  我在墨西哥  我是来见你的
Babe, look, I'm in Mexico. I came to see you.

405
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,020
真的假的
Are you serious?

406
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,810
我好想你  谢尔比
I miss you, Shelby.

407
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,980
你如此性感  姑娘
You're so sexy, girl.

408
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,930
不管戴没戴假发
In or out of the wig.

409
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,850
我都不在乎了  谢尔比
I don't care. Shelby.

410
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,400
你使我勇气倍增  宝贝
You make me so feel brave, babe,

411
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,210
你对我而言是史无前例独一无二的
and I've never felt like this about anybody else before.

412
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,270
我爱你
I love you.

413
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:02,700
无论去哪儿我都放着你的灵魂之歌
And I carry your soul-song with me wherever I go.

414
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,640
我也爱你
I love you, too.

415
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,900
我这就回来  宝贝  再也不分开
I'm coming back, baby. No space!

416
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,710
你有和任何非美国公民一起上路吗
Are you traveling with any non-US citizens?

417
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,360
你就用这句台词抓人吗
You actually catch people with that line?

418
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,660
没有  警官  只有我和我的美国心
No, sir, just me and my American heart...

419
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,280
满满都是爱哟
full of love.

420
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,100
那你怎么解释
Then how do you explain...

421
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,060
这个
this?

422
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,020
解释不了  警官
I can't... sir.

423
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:36,720
全世界没人能解释这个
No one in the entire world can explain that.

424
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:42,400
我好高
I am so tall!

425
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:46,290
就像那个中国篮球运动员
I feel like a Chinese basketball player.

426
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,850
拉塞尔
Russell?

427
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,470
杰茜
Hey, Jess.

428
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,290
我不是杰茜
I'm not Jess.

429
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,790
我是她表妹  西尔维亚  
I'm her cousin... Sylvia.

430
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,010
你还好吗
Are you doing okay?

431
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,280
我想吃甜甜圈
I want a donut.

432
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,070
那我们去买甜甜圈
Then let's get you a donut.

433
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,950
拜托
Please?

434
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,780
我想单独和你谈谈
I want to talk to you... alone.

435
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,070
真是个有趣的小团体
Well, this is a fun group.

436
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,000
你能在宿舍放我下车吗
Can you drop me off at my dorm?

437
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,500
在哈密尔顿
It's called Hamilton.

438
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,340
我想吐
I'd like to vomit now.

439
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,920
老天
God!

440
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,260
我竟然从行驶的车上跳了下来
I've never jumped out of a moving car before!

441
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,850
真是帅呆了
That was bad-ass!

442
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,090
-孩子  -好了
- Hey, uh, kiddo. - Okay.

443
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,140
-尼克  那边是马路  -啥事儿
- Nick, that's the road. - What's up?

444
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,640
你得去树林
You want the woods.

445
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,900
我得去树林  你真聪明  拉塞 
I want the woods. You're smart, Russ.

446
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,450
-抱抱  -这没什么
- Come here. - Hey, it was nothing.

447
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,750
你很好  拉塞
You're okay, Russ.

448
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,330
好了  我们一会儿再抱
Okay, we can hug some more later.

449
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,840
你知道她不是这样的
This isn't her, you know.

450
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,380
她和我们不一样
She's not like us.

451
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,270
她是个好姑娘
She's one of the good ones.

452
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,520
呕吐时间到了  拉塞尔
Time to make the puke, Russell.

453
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:09,220
听好了  我们之间是平等的性关系
So listen, man, it's-it's really important to us

454
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,690
我俩谁都没占上风
that our completely equal sexual relationship

455
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,400
这一点真的很重要
where neither one of us has the upper hand,

456
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:17,240
请你一定保密  而且我尊重你
uh, remain a secret, and while I respect the fact that

457
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,350
你独处时听《魔法坏女巫》这个习惯
you listen to Wicked while you're alone,

458
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:22,690
我也能随时随地
I could use that information against you

459
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:23,990
把这事儿给抖出来
at any point in time.

460
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:26,150
顺便提下  那儿有个停车标志  那里
By the way, there's a stop sign, like, right up...

461
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,180
那是停车标志吗
Is that a stop sign?

462
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,420
你该减速了
Well, you'd probably want to slow down...

463
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,240
-我的天  -也许是个通行标志
- Oh, my God. - Maybe it's a go sign.

464
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,740
那不是通行标志
I don't think it's a go sign.

465
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,170
如果连你这种人
Because if somebody like you

466
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,170
都能泡上她这样的妞
is sleeping with someone like her,

467
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,200
那这天杀的世界整个乱套了
then maybe the whole damn world is upside down!

468
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,390
我就随便想想
It's just what I'm thinking.

469
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:44,750
我想和你聊聊
And I want to talk to you.

470
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,340
我想好好解释
I want to have a chance to explain.

471
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,840
没关系  我懂
That's okay. I understand.

472
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,120
我之前  以为
I just... I thought

473
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:54,000
你喜欢熟女  可现在我明白了
you wanted a sophisticated lady, but now I realize that

474
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,670
你喜欢和年轻女孩约会  因为我们认为你很酷
you like dating younger girls 'cause we think you're cool.

475
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,440
你猜怎样
And you know what?

476
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,670
这招还真管用  因为
It's working because...

477
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,540
我真觉得你真是个极品帅哥
I think you're a hotty with a body.

478
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,830
我要告诉你  我不是因为
I got to tell you, I didn't ask you out

479
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,800
你比我年轻  才和你约会的
because you're younger than me.

480
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,550
我和你约会是因为我喜欢你
I asked you out because I like you.

481
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,980
可我已经忘了  该怎么约年轻女孩子
But I-I've forgotten really how... how to do this, you know.

482
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,380
自从1989年那次后  我就再没约过会了
I haven't dated since 1989...

483
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,560
那时我开着越野车载她去看画展
when I took her to the picture show in my buggy.

484
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,710
1989年  那会儿
1989 was, my friend,

485
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:30,080
我才刚学会怎么用烤面包机呢
the year that I learned to use the toaster by myself.

486
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,700
晚餐收到的短信是我前妻的
The text I got at dinner was from my ex-wife.

487
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,710
莎拉这周末和她在一起
Sarah's with her this weekend.

488
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:36,570
我没把她的吸入器带上
I didn't pack her inhaler.

489
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,720
她哮喘发作了
She was having an asthma attack.

490
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,700
-莎拉还好吗  -很好
- Is Sarah okay? - Yeah.

491
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,040
谢谢  我
Yeah. Thanks. I-I...

492
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,460
我只是觉得我该解释一下
I just feel like I should have explained.

493
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,380
那天晚上我真的
And I really wanted to kiss you

494
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,660
-很想吻你  -真的
- the other night. - Really?

495
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,710
我不仅想吻你
I wanted to do more than kiss you.

496
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,460
我还想做你  某种意义上
I'd like to do you, at some point.

497
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,750
真的
Like, you know, really,

498
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,650
和你好好爽一番
really give it to you good.

499
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,890
可我忘了怎么把握
Uh, but I've forgotten how to tell

500
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,360
正确的时机
whether it's the right moment.

501
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,360
我很紧张
I was nervous.

502
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,760
你紧张了
You were nervous?

503
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:08,090
尼克说的对
Nick was right.

504
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,820
他有时候真挺聪明的
He can be really wise sometimes.

505
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,810
天啊  真的发生了
Oh, my God, it's happening!

506
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,790
末日来了  我要死了
It's coming! I think I'm dying!

507
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:18,170
我胆战心惊又心潮澎湃
I feel scared and excited!

508
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,270
你觉得呢
What do you think?

509
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,280
我觉得什么
What do I think of what?

510
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,630
你觉得现在时机对吗
Do you think now is the right moment?

511
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,140
我觉得对
I think so.

512
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,280
很好
Good.

513
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,450
你这毒药  从我体内滚出来
Get out of me, you poison!

514
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,810
那是你的手吗
Is that your hand?

515
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,260
不是
No.

516
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:41,960
是我的手
That's my hand.

517
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,540
-我的天  -不用谢
-Oh my God! -You are welcome.

518
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,170
滚开  迪克
Get out of here Dirk.

519
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:01,940
你们去哪儿了
Where are you guys?

520
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,820
-喂  -你们在哪儿
- Hello? - Where are you guys?

521
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,440
我得走下山吗
Could I walk down to the mountains?

522
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:16,570
这小山丘啥时候变这么大座山了
When does the hill became a mountain? It just happened.

523
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,880
我冷死了
I'm so cold.

524
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,370
你谁啊
Who is that?

525
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,010
我的天  迪克挂了
Oh my God! Dirk is dead.

526
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:32,080
迪克挂了
Dirk is dead!

527
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,120
我所知的头号智者
Smartest guy I knew.
