All aboard!

Woo-woo!

00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,160
Chuggington!

- BREATHLESS: 
- Old...Puffer Pete reporting for duty!

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,840
- You all right, Pete, you seem puffed? 
- Smashing, thanks.

18
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,160
I've just been having some fun. What's this?

19
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,360
WHIRRING

20
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,720
- Ho-ho-ho! 
- Ooh, a cow?

21
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,440
You are clever, Pete.

22
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,280
Takes a lot of puff out of me though.

23
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,720
- Right, better get this milk delivered. 
- See you tomorrow, Pete!

24
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,280
Poor old Pete, look how hard he's puffing. He needs the day off.

25
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,640
- OUT-OF-BREATH: 
- What's next, Vee?

26
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,040
Oh, dear me, Pete, you sound terrible!

27
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,600
- I think I've got a bit of... 
- COUGHING

28
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:40,000
- ..soot in my throat box! 
- Go and see Morgan and get it cleaned out.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Good idea, Vee.

30
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,600
Look, Vee has sent Pete to the repair shed.

31
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,960
She must be worried about him too.

32
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,160
- LAUGHING: 
- Ooh, that tickles!

33
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,040
All done, Pete.

34
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,960
Thanks, Morgan. Ah, now, there's something I wanna ask you.

35
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,480
Back in a sec.

36
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,880
Here we are. Right, Hodge, that's all I can find in the workshop.

38
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,440
- HE LAUGHS 
- All right, Pete? 
- Never better!

39
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,320
- What are you up to? 
- Collecting scrap metal. 
- I'd better get out of the way,

40
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,120
- before you cart me off! 
- Not you, Pete! You're in tip-top shape, mate.

41
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,680
SQUEAKING

42
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,520
- Unlike that cart, which is on its last wheels. 
- I know.

43
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,920
But Terry 'ere's my old favourite.

44
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,560
I want Morgan to have another go at repairing him.

45
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,760
Oh, Pete,

46
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,560
- last time I patched this up, I said that was it. 
- I know,

47
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,760
but I can't bear to part with Terry. He's been with me since I was young.

48
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,960
Leave him with me and I'll see what I can do. No promises.

49
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,240
- Thanks, Morgan. 
- TOOTING

50
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,560
Poor old Pete doesn't look good.

51
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,280
- Shh! I can hear Morgan talking. 
- He's too old and worn out, Lori.

52
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,880
Oh, it's so sad,

53
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,520
- he's over 100 years old, isn't he? 
- Yes, but at the scrapyard,

54
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,320
- he could be turned into something more useful. 
- Oh!

55
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,280
They want to send Pete to the scrapyard!

56
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,960
- But he's only a bit tired. Are you sure they meant him? 
- Yeah.

57
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:28,760
- Who else is over 100? 
- Should I go and find Pete? 
- Why spoil his day?

58
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,080
- Let's wait till he comes back. 
- They're going to tell Pete later.

59
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,560
- Good, we still have time to change their minds. 
- How?

60
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,720
- We'll prove that there's PLENTY of spark left in him. 
- Yeah,

61
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,720
- let's show them! 
- Pete needs a nice, long rest. ..I know,

62
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,200
- I'll do all his jobs! 
- Brilliant plan, Brewster!

63
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,120
DING-DONG! Pete!

64
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,960
- Pete? 
- He left, Vee. 
- Oh, could you give him a message? 
- Yeah, no prob.

65
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:00,240
There are some wagons of manure to take to the garden centre urgently.

66
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,200
The smell is dreadful!

67
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,520
I'll let him know.

68
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,600
..Psst, Zephie, keep Pete out of the way and I'll take the stinky stuff.

69
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,440
- TOOTING 
- Bring out your scrap!

70
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,720
- Eh, is Pete gonna let us take this old heap? 
- Well, I can't fix it,

71
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,440
- but I think HE should decide. 
- OK, we'll ask him gently.

72
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,280
TOOTING

73
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,680
Ooh, what a beauty!

74
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,480
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

75
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,480
- Ha-ha-ha! 
- FAINT WHISTLING

76
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,160
Oh, poor thing, he can hardly catch his breath!

77
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,960
- Pete, I've got a message for you! 
- What's that?

78
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,240
- Get cleaned up in the Chugwash, then have a lovely nap. 
- But I'm clean,

79
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,200
and I don't need a rest.

80
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,320
Still, Vee usually knows best.

81
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,760
TOOTING

82
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,920
- Message received and understood, Vee! 
- Oh, good, I'll be glad when

83
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:05,840
- that terrible pong has gone, Pete. 
- I don't understand.

84
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,800
- I had a good wash this morning. 
- Hi, Vee, the manure's been delivered.

85
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,280
Goodness me, Pete's quick today!

86
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,280
Yeah, he's amazing! What would we do without him?

87
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,520
- Ooh! 
- PETE SINGS

88
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,720
Puffer Pete to the rolling stock yard, please.

89
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,880
SINGING CONTINUES

90
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,000
BUZZING

91
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,720
Hi, these cars were filled with manure,

92
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,680
- I think they'll need a wash. 
- Phwoar, I smell what you mean!

93
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,400
Who's the boxcar for?

94
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,920
- Pete, he's off to the orchard to pick up a load of apples. 
- Oh, right.

95
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,560
TOOTING

96
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,320
- Was that Vee calling me? 
- No, you must still have soap in your ears.

97
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,920
- You'd better have another rinse. 
- Maybe you mean that I still smell!

98
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:12,240
- Zephie to Vee! Pete'll be there shortly. 
- Thanks. Could you tell him

99
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,880
that after the orchard, there's a pick-up at the ice-cream factory

100
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,080
- for the safari park? 
- I will.

101
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,760
Psst, Brewster, after this,

102
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,680
you have to take some ice cream over to the safari park.

103
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,400
Chugs away!

104
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,240
That should do the trick!

105
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,120
I think it's about time I did some work.

106
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:46,960
Ooh, that smell is abso-toot-toot-ely terrible!

107
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,440
- FAINT TOOTING 
- Oh, dear!

108
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,640
I'd better go back for a scrub! Don't wanna be Old Pongy Pete.

109
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,560
- PANTING: 
- I'm here for the safari park pick-up.

110
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,480
- Where's your refrigeration wagon? 
- Oh, no, I forgot!

111
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:08,360
I can't go back. Can you put it in my boxcar? I'll ride like the wind!

112
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,240
I wouldn't recommend that, but the ice cream's for a party

113
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,160
and if it doesn't get there soon, the kids won't be happy.

114
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,800
Load him up!

115
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,040
- You're very brave, Pete. 
- I never thought this day would come!

116
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,840
We had some grand old times. I'll never forget you!

117
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,920
You had a good run, mate.

118
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:36,760
- Come on, we should get going. 
- No, Pete, you can't go to the scrapyard!

119
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,680
I've got to, it's the right thing to do.

120
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,920
- I've got to give Terry a good send-off. 
- Terry?

121
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,840
Who's Terry?

122
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,480
Me old tender car.

123
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,360
He was on his last wheels and Morgan couldn't patch him up.

124
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,240
- So you're not going to be melted down? 
- No!

125
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,600
Ha-ha, there's plenty of life in this old steamer yet!

126
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,880
Oh, that's good.

127
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,840
- BREATHLESS: 
- Oh... Oh, this is hard. 

128
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,520
- Pete, back from the ice-cream delivery already? 
- What ice cream?

129
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,240
It's OK, Brewster went. He's done all your jobs today,

130
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,200
- so you could have a good rest. 
- I hope he took a refrigeration wagon.

131
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,160
- I only saw him with a boxcar. 
- Rattling rivets!

132
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,200
- Wait here, Terry! 
- Don't worry, he's not going anywhere.

133
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,960
The ice cream's melted, Brewster.

134
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,840
- The children will be so disappointed. 
- I'm sorry, Vicky,

135
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,240
I thought it'd be all right if I went really fast. I'm too tired.

136
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,400
- TOOTING 
- Old Puffer Pete to the rescue!

137
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,840
I've picked up some cups and straws from the kiosk,

138
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,640
- so the children can have milkshakes! 
- Oh, that's a great idea, Pete.

139
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,160
- They'll love that. 
- Thanks, Pete. What are we gonna do without you?

140
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:02,600
- I'm not ready for the scrapheap yet! 
- Oh, yeah, I got it wrong, Brewster.

141
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,560
That's brilliant news!

142
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,880
So I carted all that manure when you could have done it yourself?

143
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,720
- GIGGLING: 
- Yeah, that made the whole depot really stinky!

144
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,880
The depot?

145
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,440
Ha-ha! I thought everyone was talking about ME!

146
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,760
- So I'm not Old Pongy Pete? 
- No! You're fresh as a daisy.

147
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,160
- Wow! 
- Just goes to show you youngsters

148
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,400
that things aren't always what they seem.

149
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,600
- THEY LAUGH 
- You can say that again!
