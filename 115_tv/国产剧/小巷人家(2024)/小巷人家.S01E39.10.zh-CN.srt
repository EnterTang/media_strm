Octonauts!

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The Octonauts and the Enormous Elephant Seal.

7
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,840
Just look at these anemone, Peso!

8
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,760
They're so colourful. Each one looks like a flower or a...

9
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,240
A monster! Argh!

10
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,280
Oh. It's not a monster. That's an elephant seal.

11
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,200
A very large seal with a great big nose.

12
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,040
Like an elephant. SEAL SNORES

13
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,080
Is he snoring?

14
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,720
Elephant seals sometimes do sleep in the water.

15
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,320
I think something's wrong with his skin.

16
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,880
He's moulting - losing his old skin so a new layer can grow in.

17
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,240
See?

18
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,160
- Does that hurt him?
- Not at all.

19
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,800
Moulting is perfectly normal for elephant seals.

20
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,880
It's the same as when you grow too big for your clothes

21
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,920
and need new ones that fit better.

22
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,720
Elephant seals are supposed to moult on the beach, where it's warm.

23
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,480
Moulting in the cold water will make him ill.

24
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,000
Oh, no! He's nowhere near a beach.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,800
Shellington, we have to help him!

26
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,320
Captain, we have an elephant seal emergency.

27
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,360
We need to bring him to the Octopod.

28
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,400
And he's really huge!

29
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,480
- SEAL SNORES
- And loud.

30
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,000
We have to move him, but he'll never fit into the GUP-E.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,720
Hold tight. We're on our way. Sound the Octo alert.

32
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,560
- SIREN WAILS
- Octonauts, to the launch bay!

33
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,960
Tweak, we need to tow an elephant seal to the Octopod right away.

34
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,520
The GUP-C's ready to go, Cap'n. I've added an extra-strong towline.

35
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,280
- Good thinking. Kwazii, you're with me.
- Yiaow!

36
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,280
Tweak, open the Octo hatch.

37
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,600
Right away, Cap'n.

38
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,240
Shiver whiskers! He is huge!

39
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,280
Let's get him to safety.

40
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,160
HE GRUNTS

41
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,520
We've got him, Peso. Let's go.

42
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,000
- SEAL SNORES
- Through this door.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,640
THEY GRUNT

44
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,600
Easy does it.

45
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,960
Argh!

46
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,920
There you go. Perfect.

47
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,360
Ooo! Whoa!

48
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,880
THUD! Oh!

49
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,040
SEAL SNORES

50
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,680
Phew! He's OK!

51
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,600
But, boy, does he snore!

52
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,520
SNORING ECHOES

53
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,320
Ah!

54
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,360
- Huh?
- Ah!

55
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,920
Peso, how's your patient?

56
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,360
His temperature is perfect.

57
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,320
As soon as he regrows his skin and hair, he'll be as good as new.

SEAL SNORES

59
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,640
- He's awake!
- Where am I?

60
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,000
You were moulting in the water. We didn't want you to get poorly,

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,800
so we brought you back to our ship, the Octopod.

62
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,480
Thanks for helping me.

63
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,520
The name's Leon.

64
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,360
I can't wait to get to the beach

65
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,200
and see my friends and family and...

66
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,880
Huh? Ooo! Oof!

67
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,760
I don't think you're ready to move yet, Leon.

68
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,280
Where is your beach? We'd be happy to take you there.

69
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,760
Well,... it's a beach.

70
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,800
HE YAWNS

71
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,480
With lots of moulting elephant seals like me on it.

72
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,520
HE YAWNS

73
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,920
Oh, boy! The whole thing makes me

74
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:54,640
really, really, really tired.

75
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,480
THUD!

76
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,640
He needs to rest while he finishes growing his new skin, Captain.

77
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,080
In the meantime, we'll look for a beach with elephant seals on it.

78
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,760
Activating Octo scope!

79
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,960
No elephant seals on this beach.

80
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,120
HE SNORES

81
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,120
Ah! We've been searching for Leon's beach for days!

82
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,440
We'll just have to try again tomorrow.

83
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,640
Now, let's get some sleep.

I feel great!

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,720
And I'm looking good.

00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,920
Check out my nice new skin and fur.

94
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,440
You've finished all your moulting? Congratulations!

95
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,400
- Chest bump!
- Whoa! Oh!

96
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,760
Oh. Sorry. I didn't mean to knock you over with that.

97
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,880
Oh. Not to worry. I'm fine.

98
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,360
I'm just excited to get to the beach

99
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,840
and play with all the other elephant seals!

100
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,160
Well, I'm afraid we haven't found your beach quite yet.

101
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,520
You haven't? But this is a special time

102
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,360
when all of us wake up and play games.

103
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,520
And I'm missing out on all the fun.

104
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,160
Don't worry. We'll find your beach.

105
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,120
And while we're looking, we can have fun here on the Octopod, too.

106
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,120
We can? Can we play some elephant seal games?

107
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,960
You know, like we do on the beach?

108
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,720
I'd love to. I'll show you the gamesroom in the morning.

109
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,440
OK. Let's start with one of my favourite games - wrestling!

110
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,880
- Wrestling?
- Yeah.

111
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,720
Elephant seals love to wrestle! Flipper to flipper?

112
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,760
OK. Flipper to flipper.

113
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,680
Whoa!

114
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,760
OK. We'll make it two flippers against one.

115
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,160
On the count of three.

116
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,640
One,... two,... three.

117
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,040
Oh! Ooo! Oh!

118
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,080
- Phew!
- Sorry about that.

119
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,760
Sometimes I forget how strong I am.

120
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,000
Oh, not to worry. I'm fine.

121
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,040
But maybe we should try a different game.

122
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,880
Mm. How about a race?

123
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,160
You're on. To the hallway!

124
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,960
- OK. I'll give you a head start.
- Thanks.

125
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,080

Kwazii! On the beach! Elephant seals!

138
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,800
And not a moment too soon, eh, Captain?

139
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,280
THEY GIBBER Are you ok?

140
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,960
I'm great! This is even more fun than the beach! Let's do it again!

141
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,000
Attention, Octonauts!

142
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,440
We have found a beach full of elephant seals.

143
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,280
To the launch bay!

144
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,160
- Chest bump!
- To the launch bay.

145
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,800
Leon? Aren't you coming?

146
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,960
Um,... sure. I suppose.

147
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,480
Peso? Into the GUP.

148
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,400
Open the Octo hatch, Tweak.

149
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,560
- You got it, Cap'n.
- Wait a second!

150
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,760
I'm having so much fun here with you,

151
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,800
I don't want to leave now.

152
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,360
Sorry, Leon. The Octopod's just not big enough for an elephant seal.

153
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,560
The other elephant seals must miss you.

154
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,520
But I'll miss you guys.

00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,800
A race? You're on!

158
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,320
He's fast!

159
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,560
Elephant seals are strong swimmers.

160
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,000
I won the race! Yeah!

161
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,520
Hey, Leon! You found us!

162
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,360
We were so worried about you.

163
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,400
Come on, let's play!

164
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,800
