1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,140
我们追求权力
We seek power.

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,300
我们建立帝国
We build empires.

3
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,000
我们相互联结
We connect.

4
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,440
但有一个人的生死
But one man's life and death

5
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,900
将会改变千万人的命运
Will touch the lives of millions.

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,960
将会改变一个帝国的命运
It will transform the destiny of an empire

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,900
改变我们所有人的故事
And change the story of all of us.

8
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,480
这颗星球残酷无情 在无数混乱中
Amidst the chaos of an unforgiving planet,

9
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,740
大多数物种将会在劫难逃
Most species will fail.

10
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:51,850
但是有一个物种 却有条不紊地进化着
But for one, all the pieces will fall into place,

11
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:59,060
一串钥匙将开启人类通往胜利的道路
And a set of keys will unlock a path for mankind to triumph.

12
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:06,000
这就是我们的故事 我们所有人的故事
This is our story, the story of all of us.

13
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,500
耶路撒冷 公元33年
Jerusalem, 33 A.D.

14
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,240
犹太省的首府 已受罗马统治
A provincial city under Roman rule.

15
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,720
一百年了
Occupied for 100 years.

16
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,100
一名男子被判处死刑
A man has been sentenced to death.

17
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,680
今天 他将被处决
Today he'll be executed.

18
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:49,360
但他的死将成就世界一大宗教
But his death will launch a global religion.

19
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:59,000
如今 世界上三分之一的人视之为神明
Today, a third of mankind worships in his name...

20
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,740
他就是拿撒勒(耶稣的故乡)的耶稣
Jesus of Nazareth.

21
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,270
耶路撒冷地处罗马帝国东部边缘
Jerusalem is on the eastern edge of the Roman Empire.

22
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:23,410
道路四通八达 贸易便利
A vast network of roads and trade routes.

23
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,210
人类进步的关键之一
One of the keys to mankind's progress:

24
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,810
就是大众传播
Mass communication.

25
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,150
现在 一种思想在中东诞生
Now, an idea born in the middle east

26
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,180
并在罗马帝国蔓延开来
Can spread around the Roman world.

27
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,300
五十万人在耶路撒冷纪念逾越节
Half a million people are in jerusalem for passover,

28
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,200
这是犹太人纪念离开埃及的节日
The Jewish festival celebrating the exodus from Egypt.

29
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,380
在他们中 有耶稣的追随者
Among them, followers of Jesus.

30
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,260
他们相信他是弥赛亚(犹太人的复国救主)
They believe he is the Messiah.

31
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,500
但他的教诲危及了国家的和平
But his teachings threaten the peace.

32
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,240
正因如此 他将被钉死在十字架上
For that, he will be crucified.

33
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,690
这是罗马特殊的刑罚
Rome's special punishment

34
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:13,700
为了惩处海盗 奴隶以及国家的敌人
For pirates, slaves and enemies of the state.

35
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,530
千万人死于这种刑罚
Thousands of people died this way,

36
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,440
但我们只记住了一个人
but we remember one man,

37
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,200
只记住了他的死亡
we remember one death

38
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,740
把他的死亡当成是独一无二的
as if it was the only one,

39
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:28,610
因为这一例死亡改变了世界的每一个地方
because this one death changed every part, every portion,

40
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,480
每一个部分 每一个角落
every corner of the Earth.

41
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,820
人群中 有一个旁观者
In the crowd, a bystander.

42
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:42,000
他叫西蒙 来自北非的殖民地昔兰尼
Simon from Cyrene, a colony in north Africa.

43
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,790
昔兰尼的西蒙只是
Simon of Cyrene was a guy

44
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,460
碰巧在耶路撒冷
who just happened to be in Jerusalem.

45
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,060
碰巧遇到了这次游行
Here was this procession going by him.

46
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,560
一个男人背着十字架
There was a man carrying a cross,

47
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,130
被罗马士兵包围着
surrounded by Roman soldiers.

48
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,020
"嘿 你过来 背着他的十字架!"
"Hey, come over here and carry this guy's cross!"

49
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,380
因此一个在街上的普通人
And so we've got a common guy on the street

50
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,040
卷入了历史上这一关键的时刻
who's now involved in this pivotal moment in history.

51
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,630
被钉在十字架上要三天才会死
It can take three days to die on a cross.

52
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,900
失血 休克
Blood-loss, shock,

53
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,240
脱水 窒息死亡
Dehydration, suffocation.

54
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,720
十字架上的苦刑是如此普遍
Crucifixions are so common,

55
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,480
以至于罗马人几乎没有记录耶稣的死亡
The Romans barely register Jesus' death.

56
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,790
除了耶稣的朋友和家人
This non-event,

57
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,860
几乎没人注意到这件普通的小事
this thing that nobody noticed except his friends and family,

58
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,830
然而这件事却有力量改变
turned out to have the power to transform

59
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,770
整个罗马帝国
the entire Roman Empire

60
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,140
在过去的两千年
and the course of human history

61
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,210
比其他任何事件都更深刻地改变了
more profoundly than any other single event

62
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:51,150
人类历史的进程
over the past 2,000 years.

63
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,540
耶稣的追随者将会重述他的故事
The followers of Jesus will retell his story

64
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:16,740
利用罗马帝国的力量传播耶稣的教诲
And use the power of the empire to spread his message.

65
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,700
耶路撒冷1400英里外
1400 miles from Jerusalem,

66
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:30,120
是帝国的首都 罗马
The imperial capital, Rome.

67
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,120
这是世界上最大的城市
The largest city on earth.

68
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,220
人口为一百万
Population: one million.

69
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,910
罗马的人口密度
It's two and half times more densely populated

70
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,000
是如今曼哈顿人口密度的2.5倍
Than modern Manhattan.

71
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,110
在耶稣被钉死在十字架上十八年以后
But 18 years after the crucifixion,

72
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,290
连续的干旱导致了食物短缺
A series of droughts creates a food shortage.

73
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:00,860
罗马每年需要二十万吨的粮食
Rome needs 200,000 tons of grain each year,

74
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,060
否则人们就会挨饿
Or its people will starve.

75
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,460
五分之一的人已有福利救济
One in five are already on welfare.

76
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:17,260
纽约市市长和华盛顿市市长
The Mayor of New York City, the Mayor of Washington DC,

77
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,830
与治理古代世界最重要的城市的罗马皇帝
faces many of the same problems that the Roman emperors did

78
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:25,000
面临着很多同样的问题
in managing the most important city of the Ancient World.

79
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,140
罗马的统治者 皇帝克劳狄乌斯
Rome's ruler, Emperor Claudius.

80
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,190
身有残疾 并不可靠
Disabled, insecure,

81
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,280
但却是西方世界最有权力的人
And the most powerful man in the western world.

82
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,200
可以这么说 所有皇帝都要取悦民众
All emperors had to please the populace

83
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,370
让他们能够养家糊口
and bring home the bacon, so to speak.

84
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:50,810
但克劳狄乌斯要比其他统治者更努力
But Claudius had to try harder than other rulers

85
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,810
才能使他的统治合法化
to legitimize his rule.

86
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,920
作为皇帝 克劳狄乌斯被人们视为天神
As emperor, Claudius is regarded as a god,

87
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,060
但为了能继续掌权 他仍旧需要人民的支持
But he still needs the support of his people to stay in power.

88
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,260
他给穷人分发食物
He orders handouts for the poor.

89
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:13,840
但是粮食储备不足了
But there's not enough bread to go around.

90
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:31,210
在罗马 骚乱是人们生活的一部分
Riots were a part of life in Rome,

91
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,950
这是人们向他们的统治者
it was a way that the people had

92
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,210
传递信息的一种方法
of getting messages across to their ruler,

93
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:38,560
统治者若忽视了人民 就会招致杀生之祸
and the ruler ignored that at their peril.

94
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:46,120
上一任皇帝 卡里古拉 是被暗杀的
The previous emperor, Caligula, was assassinated.

95
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,420
接下来要轮到克劳狄乌斯了
Claudius could be next.

96
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,440
让皇帝赢得民心最好的方法
The best way for an emperor to win over the public:

97
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,220
就是建设
Build.

98
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,590
罗马城八英里外
8 miles from the city,

99
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,300
是罗马帝国最大的工程项目之一
One of the largest engineering projects in the empire:

100
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,000
一个规模宏大的引水渠
An mighty aqueduct.

101
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,210
为了把水输送到城市
To carry water to the city,

102
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:33,400
罗马工程师开凿出45英里的路 穿越了乡村
Roman engineers carve a route through 45 miles of countryside.

103
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,150
他们在山中通隧道 在山谷间搭桥
They tunneled through mountains, they bridged across valleys,

104
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,890
他们建造了这些宏大的建筑物
they built these vast structures

105
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,620
跨越了巨大的空间
across huge amounts of space

106
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,860
没有炸药
without dynamite,

107
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,760
没有任何现代的工具
without any kind of modern tools,

108
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,360
那些建筑被建造得如此出色
and yet they're so well built

109
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,100
以至于在罗马文明消亡后的1500年
that 1500 years after the end of the civilization,

110
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,940
它们依旧巍峨伫立着
those structures are still standing.

111
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,440
引水渠利用了重力原理
The aqueduct is powered by gravity.

112
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:06,020
每隔三百英尺就要让水下流一英尺
It needs to drop one foot every 300.

113
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:09,490
太陡的话 水会泛滥
Too steep, and the water will overflow.

114
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,580
太浅的话 水会干涸
Too shallow, it'll run dry.

115
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,240
这是高度精密的工程
Precision engineering.

116
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,300
罗马建筑的奥秘在于
The secret to Roman construction:

117
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,920
一种全新的革命性的建筑材料
A revolutionary new building material.

118
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:35,020
易于塑形 坚如磐石
Easy to mould, it sets rock hard.

119
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,090
这就是混凝土
Concrete.

120
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:40,430
人们谈论青铜时代和铁器时代
People talk about the Bronze Age and the Iron Age,

121
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,230
但从多方面来看 自从有了罗马人的发明
but in many ways, ever since the Romans,

122
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:46,280
我们进入了混凝土时代
we've been living in the Concrete Age.

123
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:56,150
罗马混凝土的关键成分是火山灰
The key ingredient of Roman concrete is volcanic ash.

124
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:59,700
罗马周围有五十座火山
And Rome is surrounded by 50 volcanoes.

125
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,660
如今 世界人口的三分之二住在
Today, two thirds of mankind live in buildings

126
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,060
混凝土造的房子里
Made of concrete.

127
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,550
引水渠的成本相当于
The aqueduct cost the equivalent

128
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,380
八十七亿五千万美元
Of eight and three quarter billion dollars,

129
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:34,460
是胡佛水坝建设开支的十倍
Ten times more than the Hoover Dam.

130
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:40,670
可以想象当人们来到罗马时
You have to imagine people coming into Rome

131
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,800
看到这宏伟的工程
getting some of their first impressions

132
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,940
会对这个帝国的中心城市
about this centre of Empire

133
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,680
留下怎样的印象
from this massive engineering project.

134
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,800
这向世界宣告了罗马帝国的实力
It was advertising Rome's power.

135
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,240
为了让后世知道这鸿图华构为谁所建
So everyone knows who built this wondrous monument,

136
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,000
罗马皇帝决定以自己的名字为之命名作:
The emperor names it after himself:

137
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:19,980
水绿色的克劳迪娅 意为克劳狄乌斯之水

罗马是世界上第一座大都市

今天 超过半数的人生活在城市里

全球有二十一座城市

00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:30,050
它们按照两千年前罗马的蓝图逐渐发展起来
Based on the blueprint pioneered by Rome 2,000 years ago.

160
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,260
但罗马不仅仅是一座城市
But Rome is more than a city,

161
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,600
它是一个帝国

162
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,970
它将自己的文明传遍欧洲甚至整个世界
It'll spread its civilization across Europe and beyond.

163
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:53,400
而传播的方式则是
And it will do it...

164
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,540
战争
...by conquest.

165
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,300
公元六十一年
61 A.D.

166
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:13,400
罗马派出一只两栖舰队前往八百英里外的大陆
An amphibious force 800 miles from Rome.

167
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:21,840
人类通过战争传播自己的文明
Mankind spreads civilization through conquest.

168
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:29,200
罗马人正在朝着欧洲西北部边线挺进
The Romans are heading for Europe's north-west frontier.

169
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:37,060
军队由苏埃托尼乌斯·保利努斯将军指挥
In command, General Suetonius Paulinus.

170
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,560
他冷酷无情 决心坚定
Ruthless, determined,

171
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,060
是罗马的执行者
He's Rome's enforcer.

172
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,400
在镇压了北非殖民地的一场起义后
Having crushed an uprising in North Africa,

173
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:53,070
他被调到英国去镇压那里的起义
His orders are to do the same in Britain.

174
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,780
二十年间
For twenty years,

175
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:03,460
英国人一直以游击的方式抵抗罗马帝国的侵略
Britons have waged a guerilla war against Roman occupation.

176
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,270
他们是技艺精湛的骑士 无畏的勇士
Expert riders, fierce warriors,

177
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:19,400
以搜集敌人的头颅为荣
They collect the heads of their enemies.

178
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:26,480
反抗势力的首要力量 是一群神秘的牧师:
Leading the resistance, a mystical sect of priests:

179
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:30,990
德鲁伊人(德鲁伊是凯尔特民族的神职人员)
The Druids.

180
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:37,980
他们敬仰太阳 月亮和丛林
They worship the sun, the moon and the forests.

181
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:42,800
德鲁伊原意为'橡树人'
Druid means 'man of oak'.

182
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,720
罗马记载者将他们称之为野蛮人
Roman writers regard them as barbarians,

183
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,360
而且还声称他们施行人祭
And claim they practice human sacrifice:

184
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,380
" 圣坛上堆满了恐怖的祭品
"The altars were heaped with hideous offerings,

185
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,000
" 每棵树上都沾满血污 "
"And every tree was sprinkled with human gore."

186
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:16,380
罗马觊觎英国丰富的自然资源
Rome has its eyes on Britain's natural riches:

187
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:19,650
那些珍贵的金属资源
Its precious metals.

188
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:24,140
这片土地的深处储藏着铅
Deep underground, lead,

189
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,530
它是制造水渠的必备原料
vital for aqueducts.

190
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:34,470
而铁 铜和锡则可用来铸造武器
Iron, copper and tin, for tools and weapons.

191
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:39,370
至于银 则可用来资助罗马军队
And silver, to bankroll Roman armies.

192
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,960
罗马经济的发展是建立在
Rome's economic model was built

193
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,060
其战略扩张的基础上的
on expanding the empire.

194
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,130
而扩张的前提是拥有
To do that, you need to have

195
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:55,460
一支经久不衰的 能够不断战斗的
a perpetual war machine that's capable

196
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:59,570
强大军队
of conquest after conquest.

197
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:06,100
罗马将近一半的开支都用于军队建设
Up to 50% of Rome's spending goes on the military,

198
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:11,070
比今天美国政府在军队的开支的两倍还多
More than double the proportion the us government spends today.

199
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,090
这是人类历史上第一支全职专业军队
Mankind's first full-time, professional army.

200
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,040
每个士兵都配有一柄短剑
Each soldier is armed with a gladius,

201
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,010
短剑由钢铁锻造而成
A short sword made from steel,

202
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:37,810
专为近战设计
Designed for close-quarter combat.

203
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:42,670
每名士兵还配有短矛 用作重型标枪
A pilum, a heavyweight javelin,

204
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:46,990
短矛长七英尺 头部装有可致命的金属尖刺
Seven feet long with a lethal metal spike.

205
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:52,680
另外 每人还有一个护盾 攻防均可
And a shield, used in defense and attack.

206
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:59,520
当保利努斯的军队与英国人激战正酣之时
As Paulinus' men make contact with the britons,

207
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,950
记载家塔西佗如是描述着战争场面
The writer tacitus describes the scene:

208
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,660
" 德鲁伊人将双手高举上空
"The Druids lifted their hands to the heavens,

209
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:15,500
" 唤醒神灵放下巨毒诅咒
"Invoking the gods and pouring forth horrible curses.

210
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,800
" 我军见状惊恐不已"
"Our troops were in awe at such a spectacle."

211
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:27,740
但保利努斯将军是久经沙场二十年的老兵
But Paulinus has been a commander for 20 years.

212
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:34,460
他坚信自己有实力击溃敌军
He knows he has the firepower to destroy the rebels.

213
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:39,920
即使你有激情 也有勇气
You can have passion, you can have guts.

214
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:45,630
但如果你面对的是像罗马军队一样强大的敌人
But if you run up against a military might like Rome,

215
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:48,660
你拥有的激情便一文不值
that passion wanes quickly,

216
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:51,230
勇气也将转化为恐惧
those guts fade to fear,

217
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:55,160
然后你就沦为了阶下囚
and the next thing you know you're a conquered people.

218
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,330
罗马军队的战术
The battle tactics of the Roman army

219
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:11,630
都经过了反复的演练
were rehearsed and drilled,

220
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:14,940
通过不断地演练找到缺陷
and rehearsed and drilled to a fault,

221
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:19,110
这样在混乱的战场上
so that in the chaos and distraction of battle,

222
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:25,900
每个士兵都能各司其职 知道自己该干什么
everyone did their job, they knew what to do.

223
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,230
保利努斯的军队结束在英国的任务时
By the time Paulinus is finished in Britain,

224
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:41,400
击杀人数已达八万人之多
His men kill as many as 80,000 people.

225
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,330
反叛者的据点也被捣毁
The rebel stronghold, destroyed.

226
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:53,380
而德鲁伊人 也不复存在
The druids, annihilated.

227
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,460
当一片土地被征服后 首要任务便是
Once a land is conquered, the first priority:

228
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,300
建造公路网络
A network of roads.

229
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,370
罗马士兵是全能的士兵
The Roman soldier was a versatile soldier.

230
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,770
他不仅是战场上的杀戮机器
He wasn't just a fighting machine.

231
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,540
还是优秀的工程师
He was an engineer,

232
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,910
铺路工人 造桥工人
a road builder, a bridge builder.

233
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:25,700
这样一来 便可以很快地从罗马军队调用人手
This meant you could have rapid deployment of the Roman army.

234
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:31,900
罗马人建造的公路 宽二十三英尺(约七米)
The Roman road, 23 feet across,

235
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:36,280
可容六列军队并肩前进
Wide enough for an army to march six abreast.

236
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,400
罗马的公路连接着各个村庄
Roman roads connect Roman towns,

237
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:52,070
被征服的人们成为罗马帝国的公民
And conquered people become citizens of the empire.

238
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:57,640
巴黎 伦敦 巴塞罗那
Paris, London, Barcelona,

239
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,540
都采用了同样的建筑构造

澡堂 圣殿 广场

241
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,560
以及竞技场
And an arena,

242
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:17,590
这里是罗马最据盛名的活动
Home to one of Rome's most popular exports:

243
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:20,460
角斗比赛的发源地
The games.

244
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,640
角斗表演在当时有很强的娱乐性
Gladiatorial games were mass entertainment.

245
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,750
可以看做是远古时代的真人秀
It's the reality TV of the Ancient World.

246
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:43,550
罗马帝国中共有四百座竞技场
There are 400 arenas across the empire.

247
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:47,850
最大的可容纳五万名观众
The largest hold 50,000 people.

248
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:51,490
观众可免费入场
Admission to the games is free.

249
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:58,000
每个人都可以成为罗马文明的受益者
Everyone can enjoy the benefits of Roman civilization.

250
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,720
大部分角斗士都是奴隶 被迫战斗
Most gladiators are slaves, forced to fight,

251
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,000
但还有一些人是自由自身
But others are free men,

252
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,230
想通过这种方式寻求名誉和荣耀
looking for fame and glory.

253
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,700
角斗士的汗被搜集起来 装在瓶中
Gladiator sweat is collected, bottled and sold

254
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,380
作为催情剂兜售
As an aphrodisiac.

255
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:38,240
角斗士就像摇滚巨星 他们有自己的追随者
A gladiator was like a rock star, they had fans.

256
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,310
这在他们的涂鸦中便有体现
You can even see in their graffiti,

257
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:44,860
里面有女人给他们心爱的角斗士的情话
love notes from women to their favorite gladiators.

258
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,570
最高级别的角斗士一场比赛
A top gladiator can earn

259
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:51,890
可以得到相当于二十万美元的报酬
the equivalent of $200,000 a fight.

260
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:03,580
但大部分角斗士活不过二十三岁
But most die before they turn 23.

261
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:10,010
此时的罗马正处于鼎盛时期

262

整个帝国统治着欧洲

263
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,550
北非和中东
North Africa and the Middle East.

264
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:19,460
罗马统治着全球五分之一的人口
A fifth of mankind is under Roman rule.

265
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:25,100
然而罗马人并不知道 在世界另一端
But unknown to the Romans, on the other side of the world,

266
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:30,480
有一个像罗马一样庞大和强大的帝国
There is another empire just as big and powerful.

267
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:38,490
公元166年
166 A.D.

268
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:42,960
罗马商人们来到了离家五千英里外的地方
Roman merchants, their names lost to history,

269
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,770
如今 他们的名字已湮没在历史长河中
5,000 miles from home.

270
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:54,770
两年来 他们远渡重洋 翻山越岭 勇闯沙漠
For two years they have crossed oceans, mountains and deserts,

271
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:57,370
一路朝着印度前进

272
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,830
这片他们只曾耳闻未曾目睹过的土地
To a land they've heard of only in whispers.

273
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:10,730
"在那之外 在这世界的外边缘
"Somewhere out there, on the outer fringe of the world,

274
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:13,600
"在大海的尽头
"Where the sea ends,

275
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,720
"有一个伟大的内陆国家"
"There is a very great inland state."

276
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,340
那就是中国
China.

277
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:25,350
他们是在中国的首都洛阳落脚的
They're the first Romans to set foot

278
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:29,620
首批罗马人
In the Chinese capital, Luoyang.

279
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:41,260
他们进入了另一个世界
They've entered another world.

280
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,440
在中国洛阳
Luoyang, China.

281
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,120
罗马商人来到了离家五千英里外的地方
Roman merchants 5,000 miles from Rome.

282
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,860
开始研究丝绸
They've come in search of silk.

283
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,700
罗马人迷恋上了中国的丝绸
The Romans were obsessed with Chinese silk.

284
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,600
他们愿意翻山越岭远跨重洋
And they would cross oceans and cross lands

285
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:21,040
前来寻找这些奇异的外国商品
in pursuit of these exotic foreign goods.

286
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,910
那不是他们生活的必需
It's not what they needed,

287
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:28,200
却是其心之所向
but they were going after what they wanted.

288
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:34,160
罗马每年约耗费等同于如今的22亿美元
Romans spend the equivalent of $2.2 billion a year

289
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,300
用于从印度和中亚的商人手里
Importing luxuries like silk

290
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,540
进口丝绸等奢侈品
From Niddlemen in India and central Asia.

291
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,310
但他们不知道丝绸的产地或制作工序
But they don't know where silk comes from or how it's made.

292
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:50,910
他们以为丝绸是长在树上的
They think it grows on trees.

293
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,850
丝绸手工制造是中国的一个国家机密

294
00:26:54,850 --> 00:27:00,500
没有哪个纺织者会告诉外国人其制造流程
No Chinese weaver is to share that knowledge with a foreigner.

295
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:05,560
中国知道丝绸作为出口商品的价值

296
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:12,320
这是中国保守了三千年的秘密
It's a secret China has guarded for 3,000 years.

297
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,370
这些罗马商人在皇帝的宫殿内

298
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:22,880
做了次观众

十四岁登基
He came to the throne age 14,

301
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:36,700
把他的家人从宫廷里肃清出去
And purged his family from the court.

302
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:41,520
是东方世界里最具权势之人
The most powerful man in the eastern world.

303
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,280
贸易有着吸引人的力量
Trade has fascinating effects,

304
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,080
它不仅包括商品间的交换
it involves the exchange of goods,

305
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,380
也包括来自五湖四海的人们之间的联系
but it also involves the contact of people from different places.

306
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,450
人们彼此会面
People are meeting each other,

307
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,520
说着各自的语言
speaking each other's languages,

308
00:27:56,530 --> 00:28:01,300
逐渐适应对方的文化习惯
adapting to each other's cultural practices,

309
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:05,140
去学习对方的传统
learning about each other's traditions.

310
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,720
随着贸易往来的进行
The world becomes a more interconnected place,

311
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,840
世界各地间的联结更加紧密
when trade is going on.

312
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:51,420
皇帝热情迎接了这些罗马人

313
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:55,320
但并未让他们知道丝绸的制作方法

314
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,860
如今 这已经不是什么秘密了
Today, it is no longer a secret.

315
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:06,120
丝绸是蚕吐出的一种天然纤维
Silk is a natural fiber spun by silkworms.

316
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:14,240
蚕宝宝吐出一种细丝结成茧
Their larvae produce a single thread to make cocoons.

317
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:21,940
产出一磅丝绸需要两千只蚕
It takes 2,000 silkworms to make a pound of silk.

318
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:26,710
在接下来的三百年里
For the next 300 years,

319
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:30,810
中国仍旧是世界的丝绸出口大国
China remains the world's great exporter of silk.

320
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,250
丝绸的出口路线一直向西延伸
It travels west,

321
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:41,320
穿过印度 中东 最后进入欧洲
Through India, the Middle East and into Europe.

322
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:45,120
形成一条长达五千英里的商路
A 5,000-mile trade route:

323
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:47,490
这就是丝绸之路
The silk road.

324
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,500
罗马人想要丝绸 而中国人有
The Romans wanted it, the Chinese have it,

325
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,930
因此 东西方世界有史以来
and, as a result, silk connected the east and west

326
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:58,570
第一次因丝绸而联系在一起
for the very first time in human history.

327
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:02,110
丝绸之路成为某种渠道
The Silk Road becomes a kind of channel

328
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:05,710
随之而来的是不同的商品 人民 思想
along which goods, people, ideas,

329
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:11,250
军队和宗教间的相互往来

330
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,850
贸易兴盛繁荣

331
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:17,690
而随之也带来了思想的涌动

332
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:23,760
那些即将改变人类未来的思想方兴未艾
Ideas that'll transform the future of mankind.

333
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,500
在叙利亚首都大马士革
Damascus, Syria.

334
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,430
耶稣被钉死在十字架上的四年之后
Four years after the crucifixion.

335
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,000
有一个人正在逃亡路上
A man is on the run.

336
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:34,140
他就是保罗
Paul.

337
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,720
一名传道者 一个闹事者
Preacher, troublemaker,

338
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:44,260
也是基督教历史中最重要的皈依者
And the most important convert in the story of christianity.

339
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,400
在他还未信奉基督教 逃亡大马士革的路上
Before his conversion on the road to Damascus,

340
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,970
他曾迫害过基督徒
He persecuted christians.

341
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:54,440
但现在 他将让一个无关紧要的教派
But now he will turn an insignificant sect

342
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,840
变成一种世界性的宗教
Into a world religion.

343
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,080
今天 人们尊称他为圣徒保罗
Today, he's known as Saint Paul.

344
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,550
他激情四射
He was a passionate guy,

345
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:07,350
他勇气过人
he was a guy with grit.

346
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:09,490
他虔诚地信仰着自己的上帝
He really believed in his God,

347
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:11,050
真心相信他的福音

348
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:16,730
诚心相信基督是唯一的救赎
really believed that Christ was the only way.

349
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:20,200
为了传播基督就是弥赛亚(救世主)的讯息
For spreading the message that Christ is the Messiah,

350
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:25,130
保罗被通缉了
Paul is a wanted man.

351
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,700
对犹太统治者来说 他是个异教徒
To Jewish leaders, he's a heretic.

352
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:34,180
对罗马人来说 他是个煽动者
To the Romans, a rabble-rouser.

353
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:38,000
如果被捕 他将被处以极刑
If caught, he'll be executed.

354
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:45,150
大马士革是一座石墙包围的城池
Damascus is a walled city.

355
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:48,400
每个门都有重兵把守
Every gate is heavily guarded.

356
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,530
保罗的逃亡路线...
Paul's escape route...

357
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,760
便是越墙而过
Over the walls.

358
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,420
接下来的二十年里 保罗游历了罗马帝国
For twenty years, Paul travels the Roman Empire

359
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:24,380
他和其他的信徒们相互联系

360
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,290
传递着希望之音
Spreading a message of hope.

361
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:30,030
他告诉人们

00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:35,930
"基督教能让人获得救赎
"Christianity creates a salvation for anyone.

363
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:39,400
"如果有个奴隶 一直被其主人虐待
"If you have a slave who's being abused by his master,

364
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,000
"此生悲惨万分 那在来世
"Who has a horrible life, in the next life,

365
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:43,540
"他的主人会得到应有的报应
"His master will get what he deserves

366
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,270
"至于这个奴隶 如果他是个好人
"And the slave, if he's a good man,

367
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,340
"相信基督耶稣并视之为其上帝和救世主
"Who accepts Jesus Christ as his lord and savior

368
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:51,110
"在来世 他就会得到好报
"Will get what he deserves."

369
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:57,350
保罗给整个帝国的基督信徒们写了信函
Paul writes letters to fellow Christians around the empire:

370
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:02,720
有罗马书 帖撒罗尼迦书 格林多书（圣经新约 保罗所著）
Romans, thessalonians and corinthians.

371
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:07,260
它们几乎占了圣经新约全书中的一半
They make up nearly half of the new testament.

372
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,620
"世间再无犹太人和希腊人之异
"There is no longer Jew or Greek,

373
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:13,490
"奴隶和自由之身之差 男女之别
"Slave or free, male and female,

374
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,900
"因你们都存在于基督耶稣之下
"For all of you are one in Jesus Christ.

375
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:20,530
"我们这儿的许多人 在基督里同为一体
"We who are many are one body in Christ.

376
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,540
"爱是恒久忍耐 是温润善良
"Love is patient and kind,

377
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:25,710
"爱是不嫉妒 自负 傲慢或粗鲁..."
"Love is not jealous or boastful, arrogant or rude..."

378
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:28,880
这些信件就像我们在阿拉伯之春运动中
Those letters become very much like the Twitter tweets

379
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,280
看到的Twitter网一样
that we see during the Arab Spring.

380
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,910
这就是当时的交流方式
This was the communication of the time

381
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:39,050
但多数是在罗马的监控之下
and it was very much under the Roman radar.

382
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:43,620
"我作孩子时 话语像孩子
"When I was a child, I talked like a child,

383
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,790
"思绪像孩子 意念像孩子..."
"I thought like a child, I reasoned as a child..."

384
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:50,360
保罗将这些信件授与其他信徒
Paul's letters are entrusted to other believers

385
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,590
他们将此传遍罗马帝国
Who deliver them across the empire.

386
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:58,960
"但当我长大成人 便将孩童之事丢弃"
"But when I became a man, I put away childish things."

387
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,330
在这个时候 罗马已经修建了
By this time, Rome has built

388
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:06,200
二十五万英里的公路
A quarter of a million miles of roads,

389
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,700
这些路足够绕地球十圈
Enough to circle the earth ten times.

390
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:15,840
有着连接二百五十个重要港口的航道
Shipping lanes connect 250 major ports.

391
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:20,840
这就是保罗传播信息的方法
This is how Paul spreads the word.

392
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:30,720
''信仰 希望与爱三者相伴
"So Faith, Hope and Love abide, these three.

393
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,450
"但最重要的是爱"
"But the greatest of these is Love."

394
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:38,020
早期基督教的故事证明了
The story of early Christianity really speaks

395
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,760
思想的力量
to the power of ideas,

396
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,260
是思想创造了历史
that is what creates history,

397
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,230
改变了人民
that's what changes people,

398
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,830
造就了文明
that's what makes civilization.

399
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:50,000
这一切都始于思想
It's ideas, it always starts with ideas.

400
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,940
150年后 在罗马帝国的一个重要港口
150 years later, on the outskirts of Carthage,

401
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,920
迦太基的城郊外
One of the largest ports in the Roman Empire,

402
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:11,020
常有一群基督教徒们偷偷地会面
A group of Christians meet in secret.

403
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:16,990
私人民房当做教堂
Private houses double up as churches.

404
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,460
早期的基督教只是
Early Christianity was a religious movement

405
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,660
穷困潦倒之人
for the extremely poor,

406
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,430
奴隶们
for the slaves,

407
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:28,330
还有女人们参与的宗教运动
and for many women.

408
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:32,500
基本上 任何在罗马社会没有发言权的人
Basically anyone who didn't have a voice in Roman society

409
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:37,040
都能在基督教的运动中畅所欲言
could find a voice in the Christian movement.

410
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:42,340
在罗马法律上 全国有八百万奴隶
Across the empire, 8 million people are slaves

411
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:46,150
不享有任何权利
With no rights in Roman Law.

412
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:53,320
三千万妇女无投票权和担任公职的权利
30 million are women who can't vote or hold public office.

413
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:58,730
在她们当中有个女孩叫佩尔培图阿
Among them, Perpetua.

414
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:03,760
二十二岁初为人母 颠覆叛逆
22 years old, a new mother, and a subversive.

415
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,780
一年前政府下令
A year earlier, an imperial decree

416
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:14,450
将基督教定为非法教会
Made conversion to Christianity illegal.

417
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:20,120
像佩尔培图阿这种皈依者则成为了国家的敌人
Converts like Perpetua are now enemies of the state.

418
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:28,440
他们的罪行是 拒绝敬拜罗马神灵
Their crime: refusing to honor the Roman Gods.

419
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,770
你得有点疯狂才能成为基督徒
You had to be a little bit crazy to be a Christian,

420
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:36,670
而这足以让你被处以死刑
it was enough to get you killed,

421
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,810
因为你只忠于
because you were saying your allegiance was

422
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:41,810
耶稣还有他的父亲
to Christ and to his father

423
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:45,180
而并未忠于帝国
and not to the emperor.

424
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:47,190
你会不停地回头看看身后
You would've been always looking over your shoulder,

425
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,650
害怕有人跟踪
like, is someone following me

426
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:52,720
或者害怕有人知道自己是基督教徒
or does someone know I'm a Christian.

427
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:59,040
你会偏执多疑 不敢对人敞开心扉
You would've been paranoid, afraid to talk to anyone openly.

428
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:06,420
帝国的地下警察 也称弗鲁曼塔里
The empire's secret police: the Frumentarii.

429
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:14,560
他们利用眼线来抓捕异端分子
They use a network of informers to hunt down dissidents.

430
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:50,920
佩尔培图阿被指控为叛国
Perpetua is charged with treason.

431
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:58,200
被关进监狱的她等候着残酷命运的到来
She's sent to prison to await her fate.

432
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:10,290
她喜欢写日记
She keeps a diary,

433
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,830
现存最早的文字
The earliest words that still survive

434
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:16,330
是由一位基督教妇女写下的:
Written by a Christian woman:

435
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:23,710
"和我斗争的并不是野兽 而是邪恶
"I am not to fight with beasts but against the devil.

436
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:29,710
"我知道胜利的曙光已经不远了!"
"And I know that victory is waiting for me!"

437
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:34,720
信徒们的终极考验...
The ultimate test for any believer...

438
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,630
就是为你的信仰而死
To die for your faith.

439
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:50,830
基督教徒佩尔培图阿即将面对
Christian dissident Perpetua faces a horrible death

440
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:54,300
迦太基竞技场上残酷的死刑
In the arena at Carthage.

441
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:03,860
基督教徒们会被扔向猛兽
Christians are thrown to wild animals,

442
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:07,300
或全身涂上焦油活埋
Or covered in tar and burned alive,

443
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,460
或者是砍头
Or beheaded.

444
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,200
不过只要佩尔培图阿能够主动信仰罗马教神
But Perpetua can still save herself

445
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:19,110
她仍然有一线希望活下来
If she makes an offering to the Roman Gods.

446
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:21,380
罗马人会跟这类人说
The Romans come to these people and they say,

447
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,210
"瞧你给我们惹出的麻烦
"Look you're stirring up trouble for us.

448
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:25,410
"你公开声明
"Make some public declaration

449
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:30,090
"说你没有反对这个国家
"That says you're not against the state.

450
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:32,550
"承认罗马帝国就是你所敬重的神
"Admit that the emperor is a god,

451
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,960
"你就能安然无恙"
"And that'll show that you are okay."

452
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,630
佩尔培图阿的家人前往监狱探望
Perpetua's family visits her in prison.

453
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:46,200
让她哺育自己的孩子
She's allowed to nurse her baby.

454
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:52,570
她的父亲乞求她回心转意
Her father pleads with her to back down

455
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,900
接受罗马人的条件
And accept the Roman rules.

456
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:01,920
他说: "孩子 想想我吧"
"Daughter,' he said, 'have pity on me,

457
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,050
"别丢下我
"do not abandon me,

458
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:09,060
"想想你的孩子吧 放弃你的自尊吧!"
"have pity on your baby, give up your pride!"

459
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,860
"我尽力安慰他 对他说
"I tried to comfort him, saying,

460
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:16,900
"事事均会依上帝之愿发生"
"It will happen as God wills."

461
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,300
真正的基督教徒不能抨击自己的宗教
A real Christian can't denounce their religion,

462
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,200
无论是公开场合还是私下
they can't do it in public, they can't do it in private,

463
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,440
即使在心里也不能这样做
they can't do it in their heart,

464
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,860
如果做了就会在地狱中永受煎熬 这就是信仰
because they will burn in hell forever, that's the belief.

465
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,350
可以想象这需要多大的勇气
Imagine how profoundly courageous one had to be,

466
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:41,490
将生死置之度外 然后骄傲地说
to put your life on the line and say,

467
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:48,000
"是的 我是一名基督教徒"
"Yes, I am a follower of Jesus the Christ."

468
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:53,200
这样做需要的勇气 这样简单的行为
The courage to do that, that simple act,

469
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,860
足以说明信仰的力量
speaks volumes about the power of faith.

470
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,910
根据她日记的记载
According to her diary,

471
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,080
佩尔培图阿自愿接受死刑
Perpetua goes willingly to her death.

472
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:21,090
她的勇气感动了一名监狱看守
Her courage inspires one of the prison guards,

473
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:25,680
他叫布田 之后他也加入了基督教
A man called Pudens, to convert.

474
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,180
数千名基督教徒被处以死刑
Thousands of Christians are executed.

475
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:57,800
他们就是人们所尊称的殉道者
They become known as martyrs.

476
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,330
但是罗马人杀死的基督教徒越多
But the more Christians the Romans kill,

477
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:05,570
基督教就越是盛行
The more popular the religion becomes.

478
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:09,370
一百年间 基督教徒数量
In 100 years, the number of followers grows

479
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:13,180
由二十万上升到六百万
from 200,000 to six million.

480
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:19,000
在罗马 每十人中就有一名基督教徒
1 in 10 people in the empire is Christian.

481
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:26,020
从北非到英国
From North Africa to Britain,

482
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,680
这个宗教变得如此流行
The religion becomes so common

483
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,980
因此所有禁止它的法律均被废除
all laws against it are lifted.

484
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:40,380
之后 一个转折点来了
And then, a watershed moment.

485
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,020
公元337年
The year is 337.

486
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:53,160
君士坦丁大帝驾崩
The emperor Constantine is dying.

487
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:59,290
临终前他做出了一个决定
He makes a decision that will shape the future

488
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:01,180
决定了整个罗马帝国的未来
Of the Roman Empire.

489
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:06,930
"我久久期盼的时刻终于到来
"The time is arrived I have long hoped for,

490
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:10,700
"作为一个虔诚的祷告者
"With an earnest desire and prayer,

491
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:18,020
"我可能会得到主的救赎"
"That I might obtain the salvation of God."

492
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:26,080
西方世界最强大的人接受了洗礼
The most powerful man in the western world is baptized.

493
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:29,960
数百年来
For hundreds of years,

494
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,790
基督教一直被罗马帝国欺凌
Christianity was being quelled,

495
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:35,990
镇压甚至是迫害
and put down by the Roman Empire, even persecuted.

496
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,240
不过现在信奉基督教就没事了
Now it's okay to be a Christian.

497
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:53,750
从君士坦丁大帝接受洗礼以来
Once Constantine is baptized,

498
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:57,790
整个帝国就改变了对基督教的态度
the whole empire then shifts towards Christianity,

499
00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:00,520
这时候如果有人想从中获得
and then anybody who wants a stake in it,

500
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:03,290
政治上或者经济上的利益
politically and economically,

501
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:06,780
就需要成为基督教徒
needs to be a Christian as well.

502
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:17,520
新的基督教中心在帝国的东方崛起
A new Christian capital rises in the east of the empire:

503
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:23,420
那就是君士坦丁堡 也就是现在的伊斯坦布尔
Constantinople, today Istanbul.

504
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:29,760
城中心矗立着一座比罗马任何寺庙都大的教堂
At its heart, a church larger than any temple in Rome.

505
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:35,420
圣索菲亚大教堂 圣神智慧的殿堂
Hagia Sophia, the church of the holy wisdom.

506
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:48,450
今天 全球有二十二亿的基督教徒
Today there are 2.2 billion Christians,

507
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:52,520
占世界总人口的三分之一
Nearly a third of the world's population.

508
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,690
基督的追随者们改变了世界的每一个地方
His followers have changed every part, every portion,

509
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:57,760
每一个部分 每一个角落
every corner of the earth,

510
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,090
这一切都归功于两千年前的这个人
and that has to be understood as the power of this one person

511
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:04,460
所带来的力量
over 2,000 years ago.

512
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:08,560
在中东 一个男人的死亡
One man's death in the Middle East

513
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:13,700
让一种新的讯息在世界各地广泛传播
Inspires a message that spreads around the world,

514
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:17,420
世界从未像这般紧密相连
A world connected like never before.

515
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:30,280
基督教是罗马帝国留下的一笔永恒的遗产
Christianity, the lasting legacy of the Roman Empire.

516
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:37,720
但在帝国衰落后 我们重建自己的家园
But when empires fall, we remake our world.

517
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:46,530
我们不断创新 探索...
We innovate and explore...

518
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:52,270
新的思想和机遇随之而来
New ideas, new opportunities.

519
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:56,380
但同样 新的冲突也无可避免
But also new conflicts.

520
00:45:57,610 --> 00:46:02,610
这就是文明间的相互碰撞
A clash of civilizations.
