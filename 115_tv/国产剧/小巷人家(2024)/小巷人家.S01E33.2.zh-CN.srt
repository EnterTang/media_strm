1
00:00:01,471 --> 00:00:03,975
it's a state where
centuries of american history

2
00:00:04,007 --> 00:00:06,244
are etched in the land.

3
00:00:06,276 --> 00:00:09,380
from remains of a mysterious
serpent mound...

4
00:00:09,414 --> 00:00:10,749
to a majestic river

5
00:00:10,781 --> 00:00:13,618
crossed by thousands seeking
freedom from slavery.

6
00:00:15,787 --> 00:00:16,988
ohio.

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,689
it may just be
a stopping-off point

8
00:00:18,723 --> 00:00:21,259
for some
on their long migrations...

9
00:00:21,292 --> 00:00:23,360
but it's also home to many

10
00:00:23,394 --> 00:00:26,831
who've played big roles
in america's history.

11
00:00:26,864 --> 00:00:29,734
from two brothers
whose dreams of flight

12
00:00:29,767 --> 00:00:32,303
made ohio the birthplace
of aviation...

13
00:00:32,335 --> 00:00:35,806
to a young boy
whose fascination with the stars

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,343
propelled him to the moon.

15
00:00:38,376 --> 00:00:42,047
and a talented young runner who
broke through the racial divide,

16
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,947
managing to beat hitler

17
00:00:43,981 --> 00:00:46,517
and win olympic gold.

18
00:00:46,551 --> 00:00:49,621
ohio is a powerhouse
of industry...

19
00:00:49,654 --> 00:00:53,625
once home to the rubber capital
of the world.

20
00:00:53,657 --> 00:00:56,560
here on the shores
of one of america's great lakes,

21
00:00:56,593 --> 00:00:59,931
loyalty to hometown heroes
is fierce.

22
00:00:59,964 --> 00:01:02,867
when one local sports hero
abandoned his fans,

23
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:05,335
he was labeled
a traitor for life.

24
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:09,774
it's a place where rock and roll
icons enter the hall of fame...

25
00:01:09,806 --> 00:01:12,476
and where a monument
to a great naval victory

26
00:01:12,509 --> 00:01:14,812
towers over the land.

27
00:01:14,845 --> 00:01:18,015
it's easy to see why
this northern state is called

28
00:01:18,048 --> 00:01:19,984
"the heart of it all."

29
00:01:20,017 --> 00:01:22,554
this is ohio.

30
00:01:55,586 --> 00:01:58,490
when october arrives
in southern ohio,

31
00:01:58,523 --> 00:02:02,560
migrating birds take to the air
and head south,

32
00:02:02,592 --> 00:02:04,328
over hocking hills,

33
00:02:04,362 --> 00:02:08,532
one of the state's
most majestic landscapes.

34
00:02:08,566 --> 00:02:10,702
sandstone cliffs
and remote ravines

35
00:02:10,734 --> 00:02:15,339
hide beneath the sugar maples,
sycamores, and butternut trees.

36
00:02:15,372 --> 00:02:18,476
here, autumn takes center stage,

37
00:02:18,508 --> 00:02:22,045
blanketing the hills
in red, green, and gold.

38
00:02:24,482 --> 00:02:27,651
but on this october day,
another annual spectacle

39
00:02:27,685 --> 00:02:31,622
is giving nature
a run for its money.

40
00:02:31,656 --> 00:02:34,626
it's homecoming week
at ohio university,

41
00:02:34,658 --> 00:02:37,461
in the town of athens.

42
00:02:37,495 --> 00:02:39,531
students and alumni
line the streets

43
00:02:39,563 --> 00:02:44,401
to celebrate a tradition
that goes back 90 years.

44
00:02:44,435 --> 00:02:46,971
a parade is the main event,

45
00:02:47,003 --> 00:02:49,973
with colorful floats,
handmade banners,

46
00:02:50,007 --> 00:02:53,611
and costumed dancers.

47
00:02:53,644 --> 00:02:56,514
they wind their way
through athens' streets

48
00:02:56,547 --> 00:02:59,616
before stopping to perform
for a panel of judges.

49
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,754
every year
one group of performers

50
00:03:02,787 --> 00:03:04,856
is particularly impressive,

51
00:03:04,888 --> 00:03:06,723
especially from the air.

52
00:03:06,757 --> 00:03:10,762
the ohio university band,
known as the "marching 110,"

53
00:03:10,794 --> 00:03:14,732
who call themselves "the most
exciting band in the land."

54
00:03:14,764 --> 00:03:17,535
they're already legendary
far beyond athens,

55
00:03:17,567 --> 00:03:20,304
thanks to their
high-energy dance moves

56
00:03:20,337 --> 00:03:23,340
and youtube videos
that have gone viral

57
00:03:23,374 --> 00:03:27,044
and attracted millions of hits.

58
00:03:27,078 --> 00:03:28,346
when the parade is over,

59
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:31,416
the 110 heads down the hill
to peden stadium,

60
00:03:31,448 --> 00:03:35,319
home of
the ohio university bobcats.

61
00:03:35,352 --> 00:03:38,355
they're rehearsing for this
afternoon's homecoming game,

62
00:03:38,388 --> 00:03:41,425
when the bobcats will face off
with their longtime rival,

63
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:43,928
the akron zips.

64
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,429
and during halftime,

65
00:03:45,462 --> 00:03:48,432
the marching 110 will keep
team spirit soaring

66
00:03:48,466 --> 00:03:52,537
with their signature moves,
including the diamond ohio,

67
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:54,771
a formation that spells out
their school name

68
00:03:54,805 --> 00:03:56,741
in the shape of a diamond.

69
00:03:59,342 --> 00:04:02,412
their impressive
choreography and spirit

70
00:04:02,446 --> 00:04:04,948
has won them performances
at carnegie hall,

71
00:04:04,982 --> 00:04:07,518
in presidential
inaugural parades,

72
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,853
and on "late night
with david letterman."

73
00:04:09,887 --> 00:04:12,090
but athens is the place
they call home.

74
00:04:16,927 --> 00:04:18,695
ohio university

75
00:04:18,729 --> 00:04:21,431
has been located here on
the banks of the hocking river

76
00:04:21,465 --> 00:04:23,368
since 1804,

77
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,771
thanks in part to a deal drafted
by president thomas jefferson.

78
00:04:27,804 --> 00:04:30,407
that deal,
called the northwest ordinance,

79
00:04:30,441 --> 00:04:33,678
helped ensure that
new territories, like ohio,

80
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:37,014
set aside land for universities.

81
00:04:37,047 --> 00:04:39,016
it's tempting to wonder
what jefferson would have made

82
00:04:39,049 --> 00:04:41,686
of the university's
most recent achievement:

83
00:04:41,719 --> 00:04:45,823
ranking among america's
top party schools.

84
00:04:45,855 --> 00:04:50,827
one well-known alumnus was no
stranger to that reputation.

85
00:04:50,861 --> 00:04:54,332
in 1943, a freshman
named paul newman

86
00:04:54,364 --> 00:04:56,900
joined the phi kappa tau
fraternity,

87
00:04:56,934 --> 00:04:59,604
but he didn't last here long.

88
00:04:59,636 --> 00:05:01,638
one night, he allegedly
rolled a beer keg

89
00:05:01,672 --> 00:05:03,975
down a hill on campus.

90
00:05:04,008 --> 00:05:05,777
when the keg crashed into a car

91
00:05:05,809 --> 00:05:07,845
owned by
the university president,

92
00:05:07,878 --> 00:05:09,681
newman was expelled.

93
00:05:11,582 --> 00:05:13,484
before becoming a famous actor,

94
00:05:13,516 --> 00:05:15,619
paul newman
then joined the navy,

95
00:05:15,652 --> 00:05:17,054
hoping to become a pilot.

96
00:05:17,087 --> 00:05:18,855
but his dream of flight
was dashed

97
00:05:18,888 --> 00:05:21,626
when he was found
to be colorblind.

98
00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:23,861
but here in the small town
of wapakoneta,

99
00:05:23,893 --> 00:05:27,030
another young man
shared newman's dream of flight,

100
00:05:27,063 --> 00:05:30,835
and his journey would soon
turn extraordinary.

101
00:05:30,867 --> 00:05:32,602
in 1944,

102
00:05:32,636 --> 00:05:35,773
a 14-year-old boy
named neil armstrong

103
00:05:35,806 --> 00:05:38,575
and his family
moved into this corner house.

104
00:05:38,609 --> 00:05:41,846
gazing out at the night sky
from his second-floor bedroom,

105
00:05:41,878 --> 00:05:46,818
the young armstrong fell in love
with the idea of flight.

106
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,852
he got his pilot's license
just two years later

107
00:05:48,886 --> 00:05:50,388
at the age of 16,

108
00:05:50,421 --> 00:05:53,524
even before he could drive.

109
00:05:53,556 --> 00:05:57,595
armstrong flew for the navy and
worked as a test pilot for nasa

110
00:05:57,628 --> 00:05:59,931
before becoming an astronaut.

111
00:05:59,963 --> 00:06:02,566
on july 16, 1969,

112
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,035
he and the rest
of the<i> apollo 11</i> crew

113
00:06:05,068 --> 00:06:07,804
lifted off from cape canaveral.

114
00:06:07,837 --> 00:06:10,441
it was four days later,
on july 20th,

115
00:06:10,474 --> 00:06:15,079
that armstrong set foot
on the moon.

116
00:06:15,112 --> 00:06:17,814
while he inspired
millions around the world,

117
00:06:17,847 --> 00:06:19,316
people here in wapakoneta

118
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:23,321
were especially proud
of their hometown hero.

119
00:06:23,354 --> 00:06:25,823
that same day,
ohio governor james rhodes

120
00:06:25,855 --> 00:06:29,359
proposed building a museum
to honor armstrong

121
00:06:29,393 --> 00:06:32,763
and the state's contribution
to space flight.

122
00:06:32,797 --> 00:06:33,998
just three years later,

123
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:37,801
the armstrong air & space museum
opened its doors.

124
00:06:37,835 --> 00:06:42,806
from the air, it looks more like
a moon station than a museum.

125
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,011
inside is a gemini capsule,
a moon rock, and a simulator

126
00:06:47,044 --> 00:06:48,346
that gives visitors a chance

127
00:06:48,378 --> 00:06:51,915
to feel what's it's like
to land on the moon.

128
00:06:51,948 --> 00:06:55,686
after his gravity-defying
travels and worldwide fame,

129
00:06:55,719 --> 00:06:59,857
armstrong ultimately chose
to come back home to ohio.

130
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,460
he took a job as professor
of aerospace engineering

131
00:07:02,492 --> 00:07:04,961
at the university of cincinnati.

132
00:07:04,994 --> 00:07:06,663
but he wasn't the first in ohio

133
00:07:06,696 --> 00:07:10,535
to explore
the mysteries of the skies.

134
00:07:10,568 --> 00:07:14,472
in adams county, not far
from corn and cattle farms,

135
00:07:14,504 --> 00:07:17,007
lies an archaeological mystery--

136
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,777
an ancient earthwork
that snakes across the land,

137
00:07:20,811 --> 00:07:25,015
a site known today
as serpent mound.

138
00:07:25,049 --> 00:07:27,351
spanning over 1,300 feet,

139
00:07:27,383 --> 00:07:30,687
this prehistoric formation
poses a riddle,

140
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,057
one with twists and turns
like the serpent itself.

141
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,792
who created it?

142
00:07:35,825 --> 00:07:37,427
and why?

143
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,931
early settlers believed
it was a shrine,

144
00:07:39,963 --> 00:07:41,598
possibly a cemetery,

145
00:07:41,631 --> 00:07:44,835
or even a place
for human sacrifice.

146
00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:48,005
in 1901,
a baptist minister suggested

147
00:07:48,037 --> 00:07:52,309
the serpent marked
the original location of eden.

148
00:07:52,342 --> 00:07:56,080
carbon dating suggests
it was built around 1070 a.d.,

149
00:07:56,112 --> 00:07:58,381
possibly by
the fort ancient people,

150
00:07:58,414 --> 00:08:00,417
a native american culture
that once thrived here

151
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:03,621
on the land that's now ohio.

152
00:08:03,653 --> 00:08:05,789
researchers have discovered
that features of the mound

153
00:08:05,823 --> 00:08:08,626
align with both
the winter solstice sunrise

154
00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:11,395
and the summer solstice sunset.

155
00:08:11,427 --> 00:08:13,697
but the true intentions
of its builders

156
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,765
remain a mystery.

157
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:17,935
some believe they were
giving earthly form

158
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:19,970
to the constellation draco,

159
00:08:20,003 --> 00:08:24,109
a celestial dragon that winds
around the big dipper.

160
00:08:25,775 --> 00:08:27,644
ohio's native people

161
00:08:27,677 --> 00:08:30,380
may have turned to the skies
for guidance,

162
00:08:30,413 --> 00:08:31,782
but for sustenance,

163
00:08:31,815 --> 00:08:37,354
they relied on the slow flowing
waters of the nearby ohio river.

164
00:08:37,388 --> 00:08:40,858
this river valley was once
the home of the iroquois people,

165
00:08:40,891 --> 00:08:43,828
who called the majestic waterway
that flowed through their land:

166
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,731
"o-y-o," or "great river."

167
00:08:47,764 --> 00:08:52,569
it was from "o-y-o"
that ohio got its name.

168
00:08:52,603 --> 00:08:56,073
the ohio flows more
than 980 miles,

169
00:08:56,105 --> 00:08:58,408
from its start
in pittsburgh, pennsylvania,

170
00:08:58,441 --> 00:09:00,477
to the mississippi.

171
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,946
with its particularly
smooth and clear waters,

172
00:09:02,979 --> 00:09:09,119
thomas jefferson declared it the
"most beautiful river on earth."

173
00:09:09,152 --> 00:09:12,023
but at the time,
it lay on the wild frontier

174
00:09:12,056 --> 00:09:13,724
and acted as an uneasy border

175
00:09:13,757 --> 00:09:16,426
between european settlements
to the south

176
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,830
and native americans
to the north.

177
00:09:20,864 --> 00:09:24,067
after the revolutionary war,
the new u.s. congress

178
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,337
declared a vast swath of land
west of the river

179
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,539
as new territory.

180
00:09:29,572 --> 00:09:32,542
today, that land
is now the five states

181
00:09:32,575 --> 00:09:37,547
of wisconsin, michigan,
illinois, indiana, and ohio.

182
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,783
but in the late 1700s,

183
00:09:39,816 --> 00:09:43,553
it was known simply
as the northwest territory.

184
00:09:43,586 --> 00:09:46,523
and the first permanent
settlement in this new territory

185
00:09:46,556 --> 00:09:48,859
was here on the ohio river--

186
00:09:48,892 --> 00:09:51,628
a place called marietta.

187
00:09:55,532 --> 00:09:58,735
it had been carved
out of the forest in 1788

188
00:09:58,768 --> 00:10:00,705
by brigadier general
rufus putnam

189
00:10:00,738 --> 00:10:04,275
and other veterans
of the revolutionary war.

190
00:10:04,307 --> 00:10:06,343
after the war,
the u.s. government

191
00:10:06,377 --> 00:10:09,313
ran out of funds
to pay its freedom fighters,

192
00:10:09,345 --> 00:10:12,015
so it offered them land instead.

193
00:10:12,048 --> 00:10:14,718
when it came time to name
their new frontier town,

194
00:10:14,752 --> 00:10:17,854
they chose "marietta,"
after marie antoinette,

195
00:10:17,888 --> 00:10:23,326
as a gesture of gratitude
for france's support in the war.

196
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:27,731
marietta soon played a key role
in the development of ohio,

197
00:10:27,764 --> 00:10:30,734
since it was the gateway
to the rest of the state.

198
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:34,772
thousands flooded into the area,

199
00:10:34,805 --> 00:10:36,974
and marietta and other
new settlements to the west

200
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:40,311
quickly boomed.

201
00:10:40,344 --> 00:10:45,449
by 1802, the territories had
45,000 residents combined,

202
00:10:45,481 --> 00:10:49,886
and soon, its supporters were
applying for ohio statehood.

203
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,457
but the question was
how would it enter the union?

204
00:10:53,489 --> 00:10:58,329
as a free state,
or as a slave state?

205
00:10:58,361 --> 00:11:00,964
as delegates raced to write
a new constitution,

206
00:11:00,998 --> 00:11:04,402
a passionate abolitionist
named ephraim cutler

207
00:11:04,435 --> 00:11:06,270
drafted a veto of slavery

208
00:11:06,302 --> 00:11:09,472
to be included
in the state's bill of rights.

209
00:11:09,505 --> 00:11:12,742
he managed to convince enough
delegates to get the veto passed

210
00:11:12,776 --> 00:11:14,979
by just one vote,

211
00:11:15,012 --> 00:11:18,582
which is how ohio
came to be a free state,

212
00:11:18,614 --> 00:11:23,019
with slave states
just below the border.

213
00:11:23,052 --> 00:11:24,621
over the coming decades,

214
00:11:24,654 --> 00:11:27,290
the ohio river
became a symbol of hope

215
00:11:27,324 --> 00:11:29,359
for thousands of escaped slaves

216
00:11:29,393 --> 00:11:32,963
fleeing the south
on the underground railroad.

217
00:11:32,995 --> 00:11:35,632
they called it
"the river jordan,"

218
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:39,302
for once they crossed the ohio
from kentucky or west virginia,

219
00:11:39,335 --> 00:11:42,873
they knew they were
on their way to freedom.

220
00:11:42,906 --> 00:11:45,476
in the dark of night,
slaves and their helpers

221
00:11:45,508 --> 00:11:49,346
made the journey across
the ohio river in small boats

222
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:51,915
to houses of refuge
like this one:

223
00:11:51,949 --> 00:11:53,852
the sawyer-curtis house.

224
00:11:53,984 --> 00:11:55,753
for the owners
of these safe havens

225
00:11:55,786 --> 00:11:57,689
and for the slaves themselves,

226
00:11:57,722 --> 00:12:00,358
there was great risk.

227
00:12:00,391 --> 00:12:02,960
even though slavery
was outlawed in ohio,

228
00:12:04,493 --> 00:12:06,229
slave owners from other states

229
00:12:06,262 --> 00:12:09,032
still had every right
to cross the river, too,

230
00:12:09,065 --> 00:12:13,136
and seize any slave
that had escaped into ohio.

231
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:18,909
and in 1850, the u.s. congress
passed the fugitive slave act,

232
00:12:18,942 --> 00:12:20,811
that not only required
escaped slaves

233
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,450
tells the powerful stories

234
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:34,120
of the more than 40,000 slaves
who arrived in ohio,

235
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:36,924
risking their lives
for a chance at liberty,

236
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:38,159
and of those here

237
00:12:43,992 --> 00:12:48,597
who helped them make
their journey to freedom.

238
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:49,898
but escaped slaves

239
00:12:49,931 --> 00:12:52,700
weren't the only ones
who found a haven here.

240
00:12:52,734 --> 00:12:56,905
cincinnati had already attracted
others looking for opportunity,

241
00:12:56,937 --> 00:12:58,773
especially german immigrants,

242
00:12:58,806 --> 00:13:02,477
who settled here,
in the over-the-rhine district.

243
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:05,646
houses, markets, churches,
even breweries

244
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,816
look very much as they did
in the 19th century.

245
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,451
but the city that surrounds it

246
00:13:10,484 --> 00:13:13,654
has gone through some
extraordinary changes.

247
00:13:13,687 --> 00:13:15,689
what began
as a little town on the river

248
00:13:15,723 --> 00:13:17,825
that catered to
soldiers and settlers

249
00:13:17,859 --> 00:13:20,328
later exploded
into a bustling epicenter

250
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,864
of culture and commerce.

251
00:13:22,897 --> 00:13:28,036
in 1854, poet henry wadsworth
longfellow crowned cincinnati

252
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:31,673
the "queen of the west."

253
00:13:31,705 --> 00:13:32,974
the name stuck.

254
00:13:33,007 --> 00:13:36,378
to this day
it's called the queen city.

255
00:13:36,411 --> 00:13:39,648
when architects designed
the new great american tower,

256
00:13:39,681 --> 00:13:43,652
they topped it off with what
they called its own tiara.

257
00:13:43,685 --> 00:13:45,921
when it's not ablaze
with the setting sun,

258
00:13:45,954 --> 00:13:48,523
cincinnati reds fans
light it red

259
00:13:48,556 --> 00:13:52,794
when their team
makes it to the playoffs.

260
00:13:52,826 --> 00:13:56,597
ohio has always prized
its sports heroes.

261
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:59,833
but one athlete would not only
make his home state proud,

262
00:13:59,867 --> 00:14:03,772
he would inspire the world
by humiliating hitler

263
00:14:03,805 --> 00:14:05,907
and winning gold.

264
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,578
ohio--

265
00:14:10,611 --> 00:14:13,581
no matter what kind of barriers
its hometown heroes face,

266
00:14:13,614 --> 00:14:15,783
many have found ways
to make history

267
00:14:15,816 --> 00:14:19,019
by inspiring others
along the way.

268
00:14:19,052 --> 00:14:23,691
and one man here changed the way
the world looked at race

269
00:14:23,725 --> 00:14:25,627
by running in one.

270
00:14:25,659 --> 00:14:26,994
in the 1930s,

271
00:14:27,027 --> 00:14:29,663
ohio state university,
here in columbus,

272
00:14:29,696 --> 00:14:34,301
was the track and field home
of olympic runner jesse owens.

273
00:14:34,335 --> 00:14:36,870
raised in cleveland,
owens was breaking track records

274
00:14:36,903 --> 00:14:39,773
even when he was in junior high.

275
00:14:39,806 --> 00:14:41,942
many colleges
tried to recruit him,

276
00:14:41,975 --> 00:14:45,679
but he chose to study here,
at osu.

277
00:14:45,713 --> 00:14:48,316
owens went on to win
four gold metals

278
00:14:48,349 --> 00:14:52,420
at the berlin 1936
olympic games--

279
00:14:52,452 --> 00:14:54,989
a huge upset for adolf hitler,

280
00:14:55,023 --> 00:14:57,591
who hoped the games
would showcase the supremacy

281
00:14:57,624 --> 00:14:59,793
of his nazi athletes.

282
00:14:59,826 --> 00:15:01,629
owens's achievement
was a great victory

283
00:15:01,662 --> 00:15:04,465
in the battle
for racial equality.

284
00:15:04,499 --> 00:15:05,800
although it would be many years

285
00:15:05,832 --> 00:15:07,935
before
the civil rights movement,

286
00:15:07,969 --> 00:15:10,472
the "buckeye bullet"
was ahead of his time,

287
00:15:10,504 --> 00:15:12,874
and the competition.

288
00:15:12,907 --> 00:15:17,078
his olympic record remained
unbroken for 48 years.

289
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,013
today, track students at osu

290
00:15:19,047 --> 00:15:21,615
warm up at the jesse owens
memorial stadium,

291
00:15:21,648 --> 00:15:24,720
perhaps with their own
olympic aspirations.

292
00:15:28,356 --> 00:15:30,692
buckeye pride is everywhere

293
00:15:30,725 --> 00:15:34,396
across the 1,700-acre campus
of ohio state,

294
00:15:34,428 --> 00:15:38,265
from basketball to hockey,
baseball to tennis.

295
00:15:38,299 --> 00:15:39,701
but at the heart of the campus

296
00:15:39,734 --> 00:15:43,271
is one place where buckeye fans
really go nuts.

297
00:15:43,303 --> 00:15:46,608
it's here, at ohio stadium.

298
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,742
the horseshoe-shaped bowl

299
00:15:47,774 --> 00:15:50,044
is the fourth largest
in the nation.

300
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:55,750
more than 36 million fans have
warmed these seats since 1922.

301
00:15:55,782 --> 00:15:57,718
for the most fanatical
buckeye disciples,

302
00:15:57,752 --> 00:16:00,888
section 39a is the place to be.

303
00:16:00,921 --> 00:16:02,389
known as block o,

304
00:16:02,423 --> 00:16:05,060
fans here behind
the south end zone start cheers,

305
00:16:05,092 --> 00:16:07,361
put on spectacular card stunts,

306
00:16:07,395 --> 00:16:09,998
and keep buckeye spirit high,

307
00:16:10,031 --> 00:16:13,501
especially when ohio state
faces its most rabid rival,

308
00:16:13,533 --> 00:16:15,770
the michigan wolverines.

309
00:16:15,802 --> 00:16:18,305
known simply as "the game,"

310
00:16:18,339 --> 00:16:21,275
this faceoff has been called
the greatest sports rivalry

311
00:16:21,309 --> 00:16:22,944
in north america.

312
00:16:25,112 --> 00:16:27,715
despite their success
as a top college team,

313
00:16:27,748 --> 00:16:31,552
the buckeyes have had their
dramatic ups and downs.

314
00:16:31,586 --> 00:16:35,423
in 2010, the team was rocked
by "tattoo gate,"

315
00:16:35,455 --> 00:16:37,591
when the star quarterback
and four other players

316
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:40,462
were caught selling
buckeye championship awards

317
00:16:40,494 --> 00:16:43,363
for cash and free tattoos.

318
00:16:43,397 --> 00:16:45,366
it ended
with player suspensions

319
00:16:45,398 --> 00:16:48,770
and the end
of coach jim tressel's career.

320
00:16:48,802 --> 00:16:50,370
despite the scandal,

321
00:16:50,404 --> 00:16:53,708
bragging rights help keep
buckeye spirits soaring.

322
00:16:53,741 --> 00:16:57,646
their players have won
heisman trophies seven times.

323
00:17:01,515 --> 00:17:05,320
the heisman trophy is named
after ohio native john heisman,

324
00:17:05,352 --> 00:17:06,888
who was born north of columbus,

325
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:11,658
in the city of cleveland
in 1869.

326
00:17:11,692 --> 00:17:14,896
his legendary impact
on the sport lives on today,

327
00:17:14,928 --> 00:17:20,435
at cleveland's browns stadium
on the shores of lake erie.

328
00:17:20,467 --> 00:17:21,802
every time
a browns quarterback

329
00:17:21,836 --> 00:17:24,572
shouts out "hike"
to signal the snap,

330
00:17:24,605 --> 00:17:28,643
he's using a term
that john heisman invented.

331
00:17:28,676 --> 00:17:29,878
ohio sports fans

332
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:32,513
take their devotion
to their teams and players

333
00:17:32,546 --> 00:17:34,715
very seriously.

334
00:17:34,748 --> 00:17:36,884
in the 1990s, the browns' owner,

335
00:17:36,917 --> 00:17:39,686
an advertising executive
named art modell,

336
00:17:39,719 --> 00:17:42,322
announced he was moving
the team to baltimore,

337
00:17:42,356 --> 00:17:44,725
in part because cleveland's
existing browns' stadium

338
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:46,995
was outdated.

339
00:17:47,028 --> 00:17:49,264
enraged fans protested,

340
00:17:49,296 --> 00:17:52,499
and the city of cleveland sued
to keep the team in town,

341
00:17:52,532 --> 00:17:54,836
arguing that a new
publically funded stadium

342
00:17:54,869 --> 00:17:58,305
was already approved.

343
00:17:58,339 --> 00:18:02,277
in the end, modell was allowed
to move his players to maryland,

344
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:05,046
but he had to pay the city
$12 million

345
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:09,417
and leave the team's name
behind in cleveland.

346
00:18:09,449 --> 00:18:12,821
in 1999, a new cleveland browns
played their first game here

347
00:18:12,853 --> 00:18:15,856
at the new browns stadium,

348
00:18:15,889 --> 00:18:18,759
and many fans today are
just as devoted to the new team

349
00:18:18,792 --> 00:18:20,628
as they were to the old one.

350
00:18:22,562 --> 00:18:25,733
but not all ohio sports tales
have a happy ending.

351
00:18:25,765 --> 00:18:27,768
cleveland is also the site

352
00:18:27,801 --> 00:18:31,438
of one of the most famous
betrayals in sports history,

353
00:18:31,472 --> 00:18:34,542
which hit fans hard here
at the quicken loans arena,

354
00:18:34,574 --> 00:18:37,811
also known as the "q."

355
00:18:37,844 --> 00:18:41,348
in 2003, the cleveland cavaliers
struck it big

356
00:18:41,381 --> 00:18:44,718
when they scored the nba
lottery's number-one draft pick.

357
00:18:44,752 --> 00:18:49,057
they chose ohio native
lebron james.

358
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,626
james quickly helped turn
the struggling team around,

359
00:18:51,658 --> 00:18:55,964
leading the cavaliers
to the nba playoffs in 2006.

360
00:18:55,996 --> 00:18:59,967
he became the pride
of many ohio sports fans.

361
00:19:00,001 --> 00:19:02,604
but in 2010,
james suddenly announced

362
00:19:02,637 --> 00:19:05,974
he was leaving the cavaliers
for the miami heat.

363
00:19:06,006 --> 00:19:08,375
fans were outraged.

364
00:19:08,408 --> 00:19:10,911
some burned
their lebron james jerseys.

365
00:19:10,945 --> 00:19:13,481
the owner of the cavaliers
called the decision

366
00:19:13,513 --> 00:19:16,251
a "cowardly betrayal."

367
00:19:16,283 --> 00:19:17,951
james moved to miami,

368
00:19:17,984 --> 00:19:21,289
but held on to his 35,000-
square-foot ohio mansion

369
00:19:21,321 --> 00:19:23,925
in his hometown of akron.

370
00:19:23,957 --> 00:19:25,926
it comes complete
with a bowling alley,

371
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:27,761
casino, barbershop,

372
00:19:27,794 --> 00:19:30,998
and, of course,
a basketball court--

373
00:19:31,032 --> 00:19:33,368
not to mention
plenty of security,

374
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,705
in case any betrayed fans
still hold a grudge.

375
00:19:38,773 --> 00:19:40,007
lebron james

376
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,542
first caught the attention
of pro basketball scouts

377
00:19:42,576 --> 00:19:46,915
here at st. vincent-st. mary
high school in akron,

378
00:19:46,947 --> 00:19:48,416
a city better known

379
00:19:48,448 --> 00:19:51,852
as the rubber capital
of america.

380
00:19:51,886 --> 00:19:54,522
it lies just south of cleveland.

381
00:19:54,554 --> 00:19:58,058
in greek,
akron means a high point.

382
00:19:58,091 --> 00:19:59,960
the town lies
on the highest point

383
00:19:59,994 --> 00:20:02,397
on the ohio and erie canal,

384
00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:04,364
a once-bustling waterway

385
00:20:04,398 --> 00:20:05,966
that connected lake erie
in the north

386
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,503
with the ohio river
in the south.

387
00:20:09,536 --> 00:20:12,840
fly over akron today,
and giant rubber factories

388
00:20:12,872 --> 00:20:16,311
appear in nearly
every direction.

389
00:20:16,343 --> 00:20:17,978
but akron's rubber story

390
00:20:18,012 --> 00:20:22,750
begins long before cars
sped down its streets.

391
00:20:22,782 --> 00:20:24,051
according to legend,

392
00:20:24,084 --> 00:20:26,653
the city's first rubber king,
b.f. goodrich,

393
00:20:26,686 --> 00:20:27,955
launched his business

394
00:20:27,988 --> 00:20:30,824
after watching a friend's house
burn to the ground

395
00:20:30,858 --> 00:20:35,897
when the firefighters' old hoses
failed in the cold.

396
00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:39,667
goodrich opened his plant here
in 1871--

397
00:20:39,699 --> 00:20:44,671
first, making rubber fire hoses
and bicycle tires.

398
00:20:44,705 --> 00:20:49,577
by 1888, he was developing new
inflatable tires for bicycles,

399
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:53,580
and later, for cars.

400
00:20:53,613 --> 00:20:55,949
thanks to its specialized
labor force,

401
00:20:55,983 --> 00:20:58,886
more rubber companies
opened their doors here,

402
00:20:58,918 --> 00:21:02,756
and akron became the rubber
capital of america.

403
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:07,295
akron's streets bustled
as the rubber industry boomed.

404
00:21:07,328 --> 00:21:09,931
in the early 20th century,
it was, at one point,

405
00:21:09,964 --> 00:21:12,934
the fastest growing city
in the nation.

406
00:21:12,966 --> 00:21:16,470
actor clark gable even worked
here at the firestone plant--

407
00:21:16,503 --> 00:21:19,907
a brief pit stop
on his road to hollywood.

408
00:21:19,939 --> 00:21:21,808
it was an actor friend
at the factory

409
00:21:21,841 --> 00:21:23,844
who first invited clark
to see a play,

410
00:21:23,878 --> 00:21:26,781
and the young man became hooked
on the idea of acting.

411
00:21:29,683 --> 00:21:31,886
but by the 1970s,

412
00:21:31,918 --> 00:21:34,821
radial tires from europe
were all the rage,

413
00:21:34,855 --> 00:21:37,291
and business began to falter.

414
00:21:37,323 --> 00:21:38,692
in just 15 years,

415
00:21:38,725 --> 00:21:40,494
most of the big
tire producers here

416
00:21:40,528 --> 00:21:43,865
were bought out
by foreign companies.

417
00:21:43,898 --> 00:21:48,202
most of akron's rubber factories
closed for good.

418
00:21:48,234 --> 00:21:52,305
the goodrich tire brand
is now owned by michelin,

419
00:21:52,339 --> 00:21:55,576
and akron's legendary
firestone plant was closed

420
00:21:55,609 --> 00:21:56,676
when the company was purchased

421
00:21:56,709 --> 00:21:59,880
by japan's
bridgestone corporation.

422
00:21:59,914 --> 00:22:02,884
bridgestone still makes
racecar tires in akron,

423
00:22:02,917 --> 00:22:04,886
but the rest of
its manufacturing plants

424
00:22:04,918 --> 00:22:07,088
are located around the world.

425
00:22:10,858 --> 00:22:13,761
there may not be much rubber
left in akron,

426
00:22:13,793 --> 00:22:16,964
but there's one place here where
the product that built this city

427
00:22:16,996 --> 00:22:19,032
is on proud display,

428
00:22:19,065 --> 00:22:21,234
covering an engineering marvel

429
00:22:21,267 --> 00:22:25,872
that towers over
the akron international airport.

430
00:22:25,906 --> 00:22:31,412
this rubber-roofed behemoth is
known as the goodyear airdock.

431
00:22:31,445 --> 00:22:33,548
when it was built in 1929,

432
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,982
it was the world's
largest structure

433
00:22:35,014 --> 00:22:38,453
without interior supports.

434
00:22:38,485 --> 00:22:42,422
with nearly 364,000 square feet
of floor space,

435
00:22:42,455 --> 00:22:47,895
it's big enough to house eight
football fields side by side.

436
00:22:47,927 --> 00:22:50,465
and there's a very good reason
why it's so big.

437
00:22:50,497 --> 00:22:53,867
in the 1930s,
the u.s. navy needed a place

438
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,303
to build massive
helium-filled airships

439
00:22:56,337 --> 00:23:00,074
that could act like
flying aircraft carriers.

440
00:23:00,107 --> 00:23:01,709
though some believed
these airships,

441
00:23:01,742 --> 00:23:03,311
also called dirigibles,

442
00:23:03,343 --> 00:23:05,745
represented
the future of air travel,

443
00:23:05,779 --> 00:23:08,483
they made easy targets
for enemy aircraft

444
00:23:08,515 --> 00:23:10,752
and didn't fare well
in bad weather.

445
00:23:14,021 --> 00:23:17,657
airships never took off
like many predicted,

446
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:19,359
but this giant hangar
is still in use

447
00:23:19,392 --> 00:23:21,595
by an aerospace contractor.

448
00:23:24,497 --> 00:23:26,734
the downfall of the dirigible

449
00:23:26,766 --> 00:23:28,869
may have put an end
to one dream of flight...

450
00:23:31,338 --> 00:23:36,409
but it didn't diminish ohio's
lofty place in aviation history,

451
00:23:36,443 --> 00:23:38,513
thanks to two brothers,

452
00:23:38,545 --> 00:23:41,548
whose daring first attempts
to take to the air

453
00:23:41,581 --> 00:23:45,619
would make ohio
the birthplace of aviation.

454
00:23:52,158 --> 00:23:54,995
from its astronauts
to world-class athletes,

455
00:23:55,029 --> 00:24:00,635
ohio has been the humble home of
dreamers who dared to aim high.

456
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:02,936
for one pair of ohio brothers,

457
00:24:02,969 --> 00:24:06,673
it took a little ingenuity,
passion, and determination

458
00:24:06,706 --> 00:24:11,545
to turn their dream of flight
into reality.

459
00:24:11,579 --> 00:24:14,782
it all began just about 50 miles
north of cincinnati,

460
00:24:14,814 --> 00:24:16,383
in the city of dayton--

461
00:24:16,417 --> 00:24:20,721
a place known today
as the birthplace of aviation.

462
00:24:20,753 --> 00:24:24,024
it was here
that wilbur and orville wright

463
00:24:24,058 --> 00:24:26,961
ran a modest bicycle shop
and printing press

464
00:24:26,994 --> 00:24:31,965
in a brick corner building that
still stands downtown today.

465
00:24:31,998 --> 00:24:33,667
from their work on bicycles,

466
00:24:33,701 --> 00:24:37,505
they already knew control
and balance would be critical,

467
00:24:37,538 --> 00:24:40,642
so they tested their ideas
with unmanned gliders.

468
00:24:44,677 --> 00:24:46,446
although the wrights
had managed to lift off

469
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,783
on the beach
of kitty hawk, north carolina,

470
00:24:48,815 --> 00:24:50,550
they hadn't found a way
to stay in the air

471
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:52,586
for more than a minute.

472
00:24:52,619 --> 00:24:56,056
but that was about to change.

473
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:57,925
the brothers convinced
a local farmer

474
00:24:57,957 --> 00:25:00,494
to lend them a cow pasture.

475
00:25:00,526 --> 00:25:02,729
the owner of this field
gave his permission,

476
00:25:02,763 --> 00:25:04,532
but on the condition

477
00:25:04,564 --> 00:25:06,032
that they clear
the runway of livestock

478
00:25:06,065 --> 00:25:09,803
before taking off.

479
00:25:09,837 --> 00:25:12,807
they also needed a place
to store their invention,

480
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,409
so they built a simple hangar
on the field.

481
00:25:16,443 --> 00:25:18,378
a reconstruction
of that original building

482
00:25:18,411 --> 00:25:20,280
now stands at the site.

483
00:25:22,483 --> 00:25:24,284
after many attempts,

484
00:25:24,318 --> 00:25:27,821
the brothers' dreams
finally took off.

485
00:25:27,855 --> 00:25:30,258
in october 1905,

486
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:34,262
orville lifted up into the skies
in their handmade airplane

487
00:25:34,294 --> 00:25:36,696
for their longest flight
to date.

488
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:39,567
he managed
to circle the field 29 times,

489
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,668
before finally
running out of fuel,

490
00:25:41,702 --> 00:25:47,441
after staying in the air
for a record 39 minutes.

491
00:25:47,474 --> 00:25:49,744
what may have excited
the wright brothers the most

492
00:25:49,776 --> 00:25:52,779
was knowing that flight offered
a chance to see the world

493
00:25:52,812 --> 00:25:54,982
from a new perspective--

494
00:25:55,014 --> 00:25:57,917
something that their own hard
work tinkering with aerodynamics

495
00:25:57,951 --> 00:26:00,454
had made possible.

496
00:26:00,486 --> 00:26:02,689
"isn't it astonishing,"
wrote orville,

497
00:26:02,723 --> 00:26:03,791
"that all these secrets

498
00:26:03,823 --> 00:26:06,293
have been preserved
for so many years,

499
00:26:06,327 --> 00:26:08,863
just so that we could
discover them."

500
00:26:10,697 --> 00:26:12,632
five years later,

501
00:26:12,666 --> 00:26:13,934
the wright brothers
were building

502
00:26:13,966 --> 00:26:16,570
the world's first
mass-produced airplane,

503
00:26:16,602 --> 00:26:19,606
which they named
the model b flyer.

504
00:26:19,639 --> 00:26:22,776
costing $5,000 in 1910,

505
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:24,611
it was released
at about the same time

506
00:26:24,645 --> 00:26:27,448
as henry ford's model t.

507
00:26:27,481 --> 00:26:29,083
it's believed
that 100 of these planes

508
00:26:29,116 --> 00:26:31,585
were mass-produced and sold,

509
00:26:31,618 --> 00:26:33,721
including some to the u.s. army

510
00:26:33,753 --> 00:26:35,356
and even one, some say,

511
00:26:35,388 --> 00:26:39,260
to the mexican revolutionary
leader pancho villa.

512
00:26:39,292 --> 00:26:42,596
today, aviation buffs
fly high over dayton

513
00:26:42,628 --> 00:26:45,265
in this replica of the model b.

514
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:47,301
nicknamed the "brown bird,"

515
00:26:47,333 --> 00:26:50,071
it's been soaring the skies
since 1982.

516
00:26:50,103 --> 00:26:53,707
only a few pilots in the world
are qualified to fly it.

517
00:26:56,843 --> 00:26:59,913
it's like riding
a motorcycle in the sky,

518
00:26:59,946 --> 00:27:03,650
except there's almost
unlimited visibility.

519
00:27:03,684 --> 00:27:05,619
it's built
to the exact specifications

520
00:27:05,651 --> 00:27:07,587
of the original model b--

521
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,788
as a two-seater

522
00:27:08,821 --> 00:27:11,024
with separate controls
that allows the pilots

523
00:27:11,058 --> 00:27:14,561
to maneuver the plane's
pitch, yaw, and roll.

524
00:27:14,594 --> 00:27:16,563
but not everything's the same.

525
00:27:16,597 --> 00:27:19,367
the model b flyer's
original spruce frame

526
00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:22,402
has been replaced with sturdy
but lightweight steel.

527
00:27:22,436 --> 00:27:25,473
and instead of landing on wooden
skids, like the original,

528
00:27:25,505 --> 00:27:28,542
this plane touches down
on harley davidson tires.

529
00:27:31,911 --> 00:27:34,414
after their astounding success,

530
00:27:34,447 --> 00:27:37,051
wilbur and orville
traveled the world,

531
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:40,620
but always came home to dayton.

532
00:27:40,654 --> 00:27:43,557
orville later lived here
at hawthorn hill,

533
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,525
a mansion
with the wrights' endless flair

534
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:48,729
for clever d.i.y. gadgetry,

535
00:27:48,762 --> 00:27:51,665
including a toaster
that could slice bread,

536
00:27:51,697 --> 00:27:55,569
and what was called
a "circular shower bath."

537
00:27:55,601 --> 00:27:59,038
but the wright brothers knew
that success required much more

538
00:27:59,071 --> 00:28:01,975
than just new gadgets
and technology.

539
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:03,577
as wilbur put it,

540
00:28:03,609 --> 00:28:07,247
"what is chiefly needed is skill
rather than machinery."

541
00:28:21,903 --> 00:28:28,043
these sandy shores mark ohio's
northern border on lake erie.

542
00:28:28,076 --> 00:28:31,780
the waters of this lake
may be peaceful today,

543
00:28:31,812 --> 00:28:34,081
but in the early 19th century

544
00:28:34,115 --> 00:28:37,386
they were filled with
battleships, cannons ablaze,

545
00:28:37,418 --> 00:28:39,487
during one of the most
important naval battles

546
00:28:39,521 --> 00:28:42,824
in united states history.

547
00:28:42,857 --> 00:28:46,427
it all happened in the waters
off south bass island,

548
00:28:46,461 --> 00:28:50,065
which now lies just south
of the canadian border.

549
00:28:50,098 --> 00:28:55,169
in 1812, war broke out
between britain and the u.s.

550
00:28:55,203 --> 00:28:59,040
that same year,
british forces captured detroit.

551
00:28:59,073 --> 00:29:03,444
the u.s. navy feared
that lake erie could be next.

552
00:29:03,478 --> 00:29:06,448
then, on september 10, 1813,

553
00:29:06,481 --> 00:29:10,719
six british warships sailed
toward south bass island.

554
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:12,620
many feared it was
part of a british plan

555
00:29:12,654 --> 00:29:16,191
to take complete control
over lake erie.

556
00:29:16,223 --> 00:29:17,759
in response to the threat,

557
00:29:17,791 --> 00:29:21,996
27-year-old united states navy
commodore oliver hazard perry

558
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:24,098
rushed his fleet into action,

559
00:29:24,132 --> 00:29:28,036
here, in a place called
put-in-bay.

560
00:29:28,069 --> 00:29:32,540
at first, the southwest winds
worked against perry's fleet.

561
00:29:32,573 --> 00:29:35,176
the british ships
fired heavily on perry's ship,

562
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,611
the uss<i> lawrence,</i>

563
00:29:36,644 --> 00:29:39,748
killing or wounding
nearly all of his crew.

564
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:42,149
desperate and
on the verge of defeat,

565
00:29:42,183 --> 00:29:45,020
perry decided to risk it all.

566
00:29:45,052 --> 00:29:47,755
in a small skiff,
and under fire,

567
00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:50,492
he rowed to his nearest
fighting ship, the<i> niagara,</i>

568
00:29:50,524 --> 00:29:52,626
and climbed on board.

569
00:29:52,659 --> 00:29:54,595
then, perry and his men
sailed the<i> niagara</i>

570
00:29:54,628 --> 00:29:57,331
straight towards
the british fleet.

571
00:29:57,365 --> 00:29:59,067
the winds changed,

572
00:29:59,099 --> 00:30:01,703
and so did perry's luck.

573
00:30:01,735 --> 00:30:04,171
two british ships
became entangled

574
00:30:04,204 --> 00:30:07,108
and were unable
to maneuver in defense.

575
00:30:07,142 --> 00:30:10,812
almost immediately,
the british surrendered.

576
00:30:10,845 --> 00:30:12,680
in a span of just 20 minutes,

577
00:30:12,714 --> 00:30:15,417
perry had gone
from facing certain death

578
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:19,553
to capturing
every british vessel.

579
00:30:19,586 --> 00:30:24,225
lake erie was now safely
in american hands.

580
00:30:24,258 --> 00:30:27,261
today a memorial
to perry's victory

581
00:30:27,294 --> 00:30:31,133
soars 350 feet
over the site of the battle.

582
00:30:31,165 --> 00:30:33,100
with the british threat removed,

583
00:30:33,133 --> 00:30:36,036
ohio's focus turned to trade.

584
00:30:36,069 --> 00:30:38,774
ohio's farms were already
producing corn, wheat,

585
00:30:38,807 --> 00:30:40,876
and other grains by the bushel.

586
00:30:40,908 --> 00:30:44,113
but getting them to markets
was proving to be a challenge.

587
00:30:48,082 --> 00:30:50,185
in the early 19th century,

588
00:30:50,218 --> 00:30:52,521
the state government
commissioned new canals

589
00:30:52,553 --> 00:30:55,122
to connect lake erie
to the ohio river,

590
00:30:55,156 --> 00:30:58,093
helping create
a giant transportation network

591
00:30:58,126 --> 00:31:00,495
that reached from new york city
to the mississippi river

592
00:31:00,528 --> 00:31:03,265
and ultimately new orleans.

593
00:31:03,298 --> 00:31:05,633
in the days before
trucks and trains

594
00:31:05,667 --> 00:31:07,402
carried goods
across the country,

595
00:31:07,435 --> 00:31:10,305
canals were
the highways of commerce.

596
00:31:10,338 --> 00:31:13,575
farmers, merchants, travelers,
and industrial tycoons

597
00:31:13,607 --> 00:31:17,111
all relied
on these watery routes.

598
00:31:17,144 --> 00:31:19,079
long stretches
of ohio's early canals

599
00:31:19,113 --> 00:31:21,249
have fallen into disrepair,

600
00:31:21,281 --> 00:31:23,117
but some remain,

601
00:31:23,151 --> 00:31:25,386
and offer a glimpse of how goods
were once transported

602
00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:28,022
across the state.

603
00:31:28,055 --> 00:31:30,191
to keep the boats
and barges moving,

604
00:31:30,225 --> 00:31:32,727
mules often pulled them
from the shore

605
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,330
and could drag barges
all the way from toledo

606
00:31:35,363 --> 00:31:36,565
to cincinnati.

607
00:31:38,165 --> 00:31:39,968
in ohio,

608
00:31:40,001 --> 00:31:42,336
the city that benefitted most
from this network

609
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:44,205
was cleveland,

610
00:31:44,238 --> 00:31:47,309
thanks to a few
titans of industry.

611
00:31:47,341 --> 00:31:50,077
one of the earliest
was john d. rockefeller,

612
00:31:50,111 --> 00:31:51,713
the world's first billionaire,

613
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:54,348
who grew up
just outside of town.

614
00:31:54,381 --> 00:31:58,419
in 1863, he and a partner
built an oil refinery here

615
00:31:58,452 --> 00:32:00,387
on what's called "the flats."

616
00:32:00,421 --> 00:32:01,623
it was the start of a business

617
00:32:01,656 --> 00:32:04,960
that would become
the oil giant, standard oil,

618
00:32:04,993 --> 00:32:06,695
parts of which would later go on

619
00:32:06,727 --> 00:32:09,865
to become both chevron
and exxon-mobile.

620
00:32:09,897 --> 00:32:14,068
rockefeller's success helped
transform this lakeside city

621
00:32:14,102 --> 00:32:17,239
into a bustling epicenter
of industry.

622
00:32:17,272 --> 00:32:20,408
steel quickly became
the city's backbone.

623
00:32:20,441 --> 00:32:23,812
by 1880, nearly 30%
of cleveland's residents

624
00:32:23,845 --> 00:32:26,615
worked in steel mills
south of town.

625
00:32:26,647 --> 00:32:31,318
today, cleveland's steel plants
are still going strong.

626
00:32:31,352 --> 00:32:35,690
these are some of the largest
plants of their kind in america.

627
00:32:35,722 --> 00:32:38,659
and they still rely on
the winding cuyahoga river

628
00:32:38,693 --> 00:32:41,530
to ship their goods to market.

629
00:32:41,562 --> 00:32:46,434
today, bulk carriers carefully
navigate this narrow waterway,

630
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:49,970
just as ships have been doing
for more than a century.

631
00:32:50,004 --> 00:32:53,475
but one wrong move of these
long, cumbersome carriers

632
00:32:53,508 --> 00:32:55,644
can spell disaster.

633
00:32:55,676 --> 00:32:59,213
this busy river was once
the embarrassment of the city

634
00:32:59,247 --> 00:33:02,617
and may be one of the reasons
why cleveland was once nicknamed

635
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:06,521
"the mistake by the lake."

636
00:33:06,553 --> 00:33:09,490
for years, standard oil,
goodyear tires,

637
00:33:09,524 --> 00:33:12,227
sherwin-williams paints,
and republic steel

638
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:16,731
all dumped their waste
right into the cuyahoga river,

639
00:33:16,763 --> 00:33:19,166
until one day in 1969,

640
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,136
when the river itself
caught on fire

641
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,950
while fish populations
have risen dramatically

642
00:33:25,983 --> 00:33:27,251
in recent years,

643
00:33:27,284 --> 00:33:29,220
high levels
of contaminants and bacteria

644
00:33:29,253 --> 00:33:33,691
still plague this waterway.

645
00:33:33,724 --> 00:33:35,393
but it's not just rivers

646
00:33:35,425 --> 00:33:38,328
that are being reclaimed
in cleveland.

647
00:33:38,362 --> 00:33:40,431
in the city's
university circle district,

648
00:33:40,463 --> 00:33:42,733
old buildings are
being renovated

649
00:33:42,766 --> 00:33:44,033
and new ones built

650
00:33:44,034 --> 00:33:47,939
to reflect the changing
world around them.

651
00:33:47,972 --> 00:33:51,442
this modernist cube,
designed by farshid moussavi,

652
00:33:51,474 --> 00:33:54,978
is the new home for cleveland's
museum of contemporary art,

653
00:33:55,012 --> 00:33:56,914
or moca.

654
00:33:56,947 --> 00:33:58,349
its black glass panels

655
00:33:58,382 --> 00:34:02,052
respond to the changing light
and activity on the street below

656
00:34:02,085 --> 00:34:04,087
and are meant to help visitors
experience and reflect

657
00:34:04,121 --> 00:34:06,391
on the passing of time.

658
00:34:06,423 --> 00:34:08,860
even its shape is in flux.

659
00:34:08,893 --> 00:34:11,963
moca starts off on the ground
as a hexagon,

660
00:34:11,996 --> 00:34:14,965
but ends up as a square
at its roof.

661
00:34:16,867 --> 00:34:18,769
just down the street,

662
00:34:18,802 --> 00:34:22,272
another design undulates
more like crashing waves.

663
00:34:22,306 --> 00:34:24,809
frank gehry's
peter b. lewis building,

664
00:34:24,842 --> 00:34:27,211
home of the weatherhead school
of management,

665
00:34:27,244 --> 00:34:31,082
is one of university circle's
most iconic structures.

666
00:34:31,114 --> 00:34:35,919
here, some existing buildings
are being given a modern twist.

667
00:34:35,952 --> 00:34:39,757
cleveland's museum of art,
which first opened in 1916,

668
00:34:39,789 --> 00:34:43,193
is getting
a $350 million renovation,

669
00:34:43,226 --> 00:34:47,030
which includes
a brand-new glass-roofed atrium.

670
00:34:47,063 --> 00:34:48,699
but in university circle,

671
00:34:48,731 --> 00:34:52,469
cutting-edge design is not only
reserved for museums.

672
00:34:52,503 --> 00:34:54,905
this glimmering curved facade

673
00:34:54,938 --> 00:34:56,940
is home to one of the most
innovative medical centers

674
00:34:56,974 --> 00:34:58,576
in the world.

675
00:34:58,608 --> 00:35:00,677
this is just one
of several buildings

676
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,979
belonging to
the cleveland clinic.

677
00:35:03,012 --> 00:35:06,717
oprah winfrey, robin williams,
and even william randolph hearst

678
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,786
have all sought treatment here.

679
00:35:10,387 --> 00:35:12,190
but the building
that kick-started

680
00:35:12,222 --> 00:35:14,192
cleveland's modern building boom

681
00:35:14,224 --> 00:35:16,693
isn't on university circle.

682
00:35:16,726 --> 00:35:18,195
it's right downtown

683
00:35:18,228 --> 00:35:22,065
and looks out over
the banks of lake erie.

684
00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:26,003
this is the rock-and-roll
hall of fame.

685
00:35:26,036 --> 00:35:29,807
nearly 300 legendary artists
have been inducted here.

686
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,275
and there's a very good reason

687
00:35:31,307 --> 00:35:34,244
why this popular site
was built in cleveland.

688
00:35:34,277 --> 00:35:37,447
many believe rock and roll
was born right here in town--

689
00:35:37,481 --> 00:35:40,318
not the music, but the moniker.

690
00:35:40,351 --> 00:35:44,055
in 1951, a cleveland dj
named alan freed

691
00:35:44,088 --> 00:35:46,990
first came up with the
phrase "rock and roll"

692
00:35:47,023 --> 00:35:50,293
to describe a new
beat-driven kind of music.

693
00:35:50,327 --> 00:35:52,463
the hall's
glass and steel pyramid

694
00:35:52,496 --> 00:35:55,733
was designed by famed
architect i.m. pei,

695
00:35:55,766 --> 00:36:00,738
who once admitted he had no idea
what rock and roll even was.

696
00:36:00,771 --> 00:36:02,173
but after seeing a few concerts,

697
00:36:02,206 --> 00:36:04,474
pei understood
what it was all about

698
00:36:04,507 --> 00:36:05,909
and decided that the best way

699
00:36:05,943 --> 00:36:08,012
to capture the energy
of rock and roll

700
00:36:08,045 --> 00:36:10,081
was with a pyramid design.

701
00:36:10,114 --> 00:36:13,251
outside, painted replicas
of fender stratocasters

702
00:36:13,284 --> 00:36:15,318
are part of guitarmania,

703
00:36:15,351 --> 00:36:16,721
an art project that raises money

704
00:36:16,753 --> 00:36:18,722
for the united way
of greater cleveland

705
00:36:18,755 --> 00:36:20,056
and the rock and roll
hall of fame's

706
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:21,726
educational programs,

707
00:36:21,759 --> 00:36:24,762
by auctioning off
the guitar sculptures.

708
00:36:24,795 --> 00:36:26,197
the highest bid yet

709
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:29,666
was for yoko ono's
"imagine peace" guitar,

710
00:36:29,699 --> 00:36:33,170
which brought in
$105,000 for charity.

711
00:36:51,952 --> 00:36:53,654
ohio.

712
00:36:53,686 --> 00:36:56,890
it's been home to innovators,
industrial titans,

713
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:59,192
and record-breaking athletes.

714
00:36:59,226 --> 00:37:01,829
but for many out here
in rural ohio,

715
00:37:01,861 --> 00:37:04,664
their ventures are best
when they're kept small

716
00:37:04,697 --> 00:37:06,866
and in the family.

717
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,771
nearly 90% of ohio's farms
are family-owned.

718
00:37:10,803 --> 00:37:13,840
corn and soy
are their top crops.

719
00:37:13,874 --> 00:37:17,111
every fall, teams of modern
combines and trucks

720
00:37:17,144 --> 00:37:19,346
roll out across the state.

721
00:37:19,378 --> 00:37:21,081
these highly efficient machines

722
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:23,851
harvest acre after acre
of corn and other crops

723
00:37:23,883 --> 00:37:27,621
with amazing speed.

724
00:37:27,653 --> 00:37:32,760
but not all of ohio's bounty
is harvested the modern way.

725
00:37:32,793 --> 00:37:35,628
take these
upright bundles of corn.

726
00:37:35,662 --> 00:37:39,500
they've all been
cut and stacked by hand.

727
00:37:39,532 --> 00:37:41,701
this technique,
called corn shocking,

728
00:37:41,735 --> 00:37:45,171
allows the stalks to dry
without any rot.

729
00:37:45,204 --> 00:37:47,073
hundreds of years old,

730
00:37:47,106 --> 00:37:50,811
it's still practiced today
by the amish.

731
00:37:50,843 --> 00:37:54,715
here in holmes county, they live
pretty much as they always have,

732
00:37:54,747 --> 00:37:58,851
since they first arrived in ohio
nearly 200 years ago.

733
00:37:58,885 --> 00:38:01,822
with close to 60,000 amish
in ohio,

734
00:38:01,854 --> 00:38:05,758
this state has the largest
amish community in the country.

735
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:10,096
the amish believe that
modern technology corrupts,

736
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:12,633
which is why they still drive
horse-drawn carriages

737
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:15,035
and wear simple
unadorned clothing.

738
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:19,273
on narrow country roads,

739
00:38:19,305 --> 00:38:22,909
their buggies can come in handy
to bypass traffic.

740
00:38:26,949 --> 00:38:28,851
since the amish have cut off
many of their ties

741
00:38:28,884 --> 00:38:30,653
with the outside world,

742
00:38:30,686 --> 00:38:34,991
their way of life has remained
a mystery to many.

743
00:38:35,025 --> 00:38:38,429
so when the news broke
of a shocking amish scandal,

744
00:38:38,462 --> 00:38:40,364
it captivated the nation.

745
00:38:44,301 --> 00:38:48,005
it began here,
in this small valley in 2011.

746
00:38:48,038 --> 00:38:51,442
at the time, this was home
to an amish splinter group

747
00:38:51,475 --> 00:38:54,911
led by a man named
samuel mullet,

748
00:38:54,944 --> 00:38:56,813
who lived in this white house,

749
00:38:56,846 --> 00:38:59,850
surrounded by dozens
of his followers.

750
00:38:59,882 --> 00:39:01,819
some say that
mullet's strict bergholz clan

751
00:39:01,851 --> 00:39:03,487
was actually a cult

752
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,522
and that he was known
to severely punish

753
00:39:05,554 --> 00:39:06,956
those who didn't follow

754
00:39:06,989 --> 00:39:10,761
his extreme interpretation
of his faith.

755
00:39:10,793 --> 00:39:12,862
so, when members
of his group fled,

756
00:39:12,895 --> 00:39:15,632
mullet was accused
of taking revenge.

757
00:39:17,567 --> 00:39:19,269
in amish communities,

758
00:39:19,302 --> 00:39:21,972
beards for men
and uncut hair for women

759
00:39:22,005 --> 00:39:24,808
are treasured symbols
of religious devotion,

760
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:28,779
which is why many believe
they became mullet's targets.

761
00:39:28,811 --> 00:39:31,547
he was accused of ordering
some of his loyal followers

762
00:39:31,581 --> 00:39:34,918
to track down those he perceived
as his enemies.

763
00:39:34,951 --> 00:39:37,721
the gang, now known
as the "bergholz boys,"

764
00:39:37,753 --> 00:39:39,522
carried out attacks
in the dark of night,

765
00:39:39,556 --> 00:39:41,558
holding down their victims,

766
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:43,860
and then cutting off
their beards or hair

767
00:39:43,893 --> 00:39:47,296
with scissors
and battery-operated clippers.

768
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:50,433
mullet's own sister
was one of those attacked.

769
00:39:50,467 --> 00:39:52,336
the fbi raided the settlement,

770
00:39:52,368 --> 00:39:54,771
and mullet and others
were arrested.

771
00:39:54,804 --> 00:39:58,641
prosecutors charged him
with hate crimes.

772
00:39:58,674 --> 00:40:01,744
in 2013, mullet was convicted

773
00:40:01,777 --> 00:40:04,013
and sentenced
to 15 years in jail

774
00:40:04,047 --> 00:40:07,385
for his role in masterminding
the beard-cutting attacks.

775
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:13,924
but there's another twist
to this tale.

776
00:40:13,956 --> 00:40:17,460
thanks to the modern technology
that the amish often shun,

777
00:40:17,493 --> 00:40:20,730
it's been reported that mullet
is now a multimillionaire

778
00:40:20,764 --> 00:40:24,067
and that his property sits
on a gold mine of natural gas

779
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,605
that fracking companies
have paid millions to extract.

780
00:40:29,906 --> 00:40:32,509
with its rolling hills
and open plains,

781
00:40:32,542 --> 00:40:37,547
ohio offers plenty of places to
carve out one's own community,

782
00:40:37,581 --> 00:40:41,752
even for celebrities
with a cult-like status.

783
00:40:41,784 --> 00:40:44,754
roughly 70 miles
northeast of columbus

784
00:40:44,788 --> 00:40:48,525
lies an idyllic spot
called malabar farm.

785
00:40:48,558 --> 00:40:51,527
here, surrounded by
forests and fields,

786
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:55,298
creative minds have found
a place to return to nature,

787
00:40:55,331 --> 00:40:59,402
surround themselves with
the seasons' natural beauty,

788
00:40:59,435 --> 00:41:03,906
and write a pulitzer-prize-
winning novel or two.

789
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:06,342
author louis bromfield
lived here,

790
00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:10,013
at malabar farm,
in the 1940s and '50s.

791
00:41:10,045 --> 00:41:12,549
but he was often not alone.

792
00:41:12,581 --> 00:41:14,484
hollywood's biggest stars
at the time

793
00:41:14,518 --> 00:41:17,487
considered the farm
an ideal getaway.

794
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,388
lauren bacall
and humphrey bogart

795
00:41:19,422 --> 00:41:22,259
were married here in 1945.

796
00:41:22,292 --> 00:41:23,494
at the time,

797
00:41:23,527 --> 00:41:26,697
it was the tabloids'
most sensational story.

798
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:30,032
errol flynn, dorothy lamour,
clark gable, and others

799
00:41:30,065 --> 00:41:31,868
soon flocked here.

800
00:41:31,902 --> 00:41:34,271
but even stars
had to work on the farm,

801
00:41:34,304 --> 00:41:37,741
thanks to bromfield's passion
for sustainable agriculture.

802
00:41:37,773 --> 00:41:40,277
some locals remember
seeing james cagney

803
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:43,880
selling vegetables
at the farm's produce stand.

804
00:41:43,913 --> 00:41:45,415
although the stars
have since moved on

805
00:41:45,447 --> 00:41:47,551
to other glamorous getaways,

806
00:41:47,583 --> 00:41:54,257
malabar farm has yet another
intriguing link to hollywood.

807
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:57,627
hidden in the trees,
this small cabin on the property

808
00:41:57,661 --> 00:41:59,929
may not look like much.

809
00:41:59,962 --> 00:42:02,298
but it's where
the powerful opening scene

810
00:42:02,331 --> 00:42:05,768
of "the shawshank redemption"
was filmed.

811
00:42:05,802 --> 00:42:08,038
starring tim robbins
and morgan freeman,

812
00:42:08,071 --> 00:42:10,840
the film follows a banker
accused of murder,

813
00:42:10,873 --> 00:42:13,709
his sometimes brutal
imprisonment,

814
00:42:13,743 --> 00:42:16,679
and his inspiring friendship
with a fellow inmate.

815
00:42:16,712 --> 00:42:19,348
much of the rest of the movie
was filmed nearby

816
00:42:19,382 --> 00:42:22,319
at the ohio state reformatory.

817
00:42:22,351 --> 00:42:25,721
this castle-like facility
was built in 1896

818
00:42:25,755 --> 00:42:28,492
and closed in 1990.

819
00:42:28,525 --> 00:42:31,728
that's when hollywood
saw an opportunity.

820
00:42:31,761 --> 00:42:33,931
the gloomy
romanesque architecture

821
00:42:33,964 --> 00:42:36,299
provided the perfect setting
for shawshank.

822
00:42:39,201 --> 00:42:41,370
from the moment
character andy dufresne

823
00:42:41,404 --> 00:42:44,608
walks through the prison yard
on his way to see the warden,

824
00:42:44,641 --> 00:42:47,377
to his brutal stint
in solitary confinement,

825
00:42:47,409 --> 00:42:52,482
the prison plays the role
of the ultimate antagonist.

826
00:42:52,514 --> 00:42:54,051
the facility's goal

827
00:42:54,083 --> 00:42:58,288
is to break the spirits
of all who enter its gates.

828
00:42:58,321 --> 00:43:00,891
yet andy does not give up hope,

829
00:43:00,924 --> 00:43:02,960
and his unflagging
faith in freedom

830
00:43:02,993 --> 00:43:06,496
encourages those around him
who've long ago been broken.

831
00:43:08,897 --> 00:43:11,467
the film's most iconic scene

832
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,770
takes place
under an oak tree nearby.

833
00:43:14,804 --> 00:43:17,273
it's beneath this tree's
heavy boughs

834
00:43:17,306 --> 00:43:18,908
where morgan freeman's
character, red,

835
00:43:18,942 --> 00:43:20,844
digs up a buried message

836
00:43:20,877 --> 00:43:24,413
and realizes it's time
to either "get busy living

837
00:43:24,447 --> 00:43:27,884
or get busy dying."

838
00:43:27,917 --> 00:43:31,587
severe winds nearly
took down the tree in 2011,

839
00:43:31,621 --> 00:43:34,424
but true to the film's message
of hope and survival,

840
00:43:34,456 --> 00:43:37,627
a good part of the oak
still stands tall.

841
00:43:37,661 --> 00:43:39,863
for now,
its most serious threats

842
00:43:39,895 --> 00:43:41,797
may come from
movie buffs and tourists

843
00:43:41,831 --> 00:43:44,434
seeking out this legendary tree.

844
00:43:44,467 --> 00:43:46,536
many fans of the film
make a pilgrimage here

845
00:43:46,569 --> 00:43:48,005
to see the oak--

846
00:43:48,038 --> 00:43:50,907
so many that the tree's owner,
a local attorney,

847
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:52,976
felt the need to fence it in.

848
00:43:57,746 --> 00:44:01,585
but there's no fencing in
the bold spirit of ohio,

849
00:44:01,618 --> 00:44:03,920
from those
who dreamed of flight...

850
00:44:03,953 --> 00:44:06,690
even making it
all the way to the moon...

851
00:44:06,723 --> 00:44:10,826
from the brave who dared to take
a stand against slavery...

852
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:12,262
to those who fought for freedom

853
00:44:12,295 --> 00:44:15,565
when the odds were
stacked against them...

854
00:44:15,598 --> 00:44:18,802
the innovative, inventive,
and inspirational

855
00:44:18,835 --> 00:44:21,938
will always be found in ohio.
