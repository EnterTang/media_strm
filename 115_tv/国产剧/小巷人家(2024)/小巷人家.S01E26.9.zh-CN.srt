"Beware the Batman"...

8
00:00:19,259 --> 00:00:20,307
Freeze, Batman!

9
00:00:22,407 --> 00:00:24,457
I'm not that
Harvey Dent anymore.

10
00:00:24,987 --> 00:00:26,399
Thanks to Batman.

11
00:00:26,713 --> 00:00:28,208
Deathstroke's not dead.

12
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,247
Dane Lisslow, Slade Wilson...

13
00:00:30,248 --> 00:00:31,750
All three the same man.

14
00:00:32,138 --> 00:00:34,110
I couldn't allow Dent
to kill you.

15
00:00:34,112 --> 00:00:37,155
But, now you and I will face
our destiny together.

16
00:00:40,675 --> 00:00:42,176
<i>Wake up, Katana.</i>

17
00:00:42,777 --> 00:00:43,632
<i>Wake up.</i>

18
00:00:48,576 --> 00:00:49,568
Batman.

19
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,609
- Are you hurt? How did you...
- I'm not sure.

20
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:18,547
Explosion threw me clear.

21
00:01:20,051 --> 00:01:21,929
Utility belt
must have torn free.

22
00:02:15,943 --> 00:02:17,152
<i> Hello, Batman.</i>

23
00:02:17,154 --> 00:02:19,095
<i>Your body mass index</i>
<i>has changed.</i>

24
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,481
<i>Are you retaining water?</i>

25
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,941
Once that fire catches hold, the whole
place could go in a matter of minutes.

26
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:44,922
Alfred.

27
00:02:45,348 --> 00:02:47,575
Where are you?
I saw the helicopter go down.

28
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,930
We're all right.
We lost Deathstroke.

29
00:02:50,064 --> 00:02:52,115
Are you picking up anything
from Gotham PD?

30
00:02:52,304 --> 00:02:53,530
Nothing on Deathstroke.

31
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,930
But you should know that it looks like all of
Dent's SCU is descending on your location.

32
00:03:30,887 --> 00:03:32,353
I assume you have a plan?

33
00:04:17,562 --> 00:04:19,026
Thank goodness,
you're all right.

34
00:04:19,028 --> 00:04:20,969
When we were cut off,
I thought...

35
00:04:23,998 --> 00:04:25,692
Expecting someone else?

36
00:04:26,068 --> 00:04:29,054
You tell me, what mask
are you hiding behind today?

37
00:04:29,572 --> 00:04:30,484
Dane Lisslow?

38
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,320
Slade Wilson?

39
00:04:32,835 --> 00:04:34,320
No more masks.

40
00:04:35,498 --> 00:04:36,484
All right then.

41
00:04:36,486 --> 00:04:38,586
I hope you remember
your training.

42
00:05:09,891 --> 00:05:12,852
Did someone steal the Batmobile?

43
00:05:13,874 --> 00:05:15,196
Is that even possible?

44
00:05:15,366 --> 00:05:18,040
Alfred, lock down the Batcave.
Deathstroke's...

45
00:05:18,042 --> 00:05:19,101
<i> Hello, Batman.</i>

46
00:05:19,858 --> 00:05:21,926
Don't worry, Alfred's alive,

47
00:05:21,928 --> 00:05:23,831
but whether he remains
that way or not

48
00:05:24,287 --> 00:05:25,522
depends on you.

49
00:05:26,261 --> 00:05:27,639
You know where we are.

50
00:05:27,868 --> 00:05:28,863
Come alone.

51
00:05:35,244 --> 00:05:36,661
Wake up, Harv.

52
00:05:36,942 --> 00:05:38,438
Wake up.

53
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:42,609
Oh, goody, you're not dead.

54
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:45,865
That would have put
such a damper on our victory.

55
00:05:46,021 --> 00:05:48,311
Victory?
What are you talking about?

56
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:56,405
Batman and our former
colleague, Deathstroke, have...

57
00:05:56,407 --> 00:06:00,036
What's the opposite of
risen from the ashes?

58
00:06:00,517 --> 00:06:01,518
Died.

59
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:06,197
The fires of revenge may burn
slowly, but they're burning now.

60
00:06:07,498 --> 00:06:09,057
Batman dead?

61
00:06:10,596 --> 00:06:12,296
It should've been by our hand.

62
00:06:12,508 --> 00:06:14,518
Still, he paid
for what he did to us.

63
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,067
Nothing to stand in our way now.

64
00:06:18,052 --> 00:06:19,167
Exactly.

65
00:06:19,231 --> 00:06:21,639
Gotham is ours for the plucking.

66
00:06:21,927 --> 00:06:22,906
Yes.

67
00:06:23,054 --> 00:06:24,858
But you misunderstand.

68
00:06:26,431 --> 00:06:27,910
When I said "ours",

69
00:06:28,093 --> 00:06:30,193
I wasn't including you.

70
00:06:31,783 --> 00:06:33,647
Deathstroke is leading you
into a trap.

71
00:06:33,885 --> 00:06:34,967
Of course he is.

72
00:06:34,969 --> 00:06:37,388
And by walking into it,
he'll lead me to Alfred.

73
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,109
Unless he kills you first.

74
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:42,198
At Bruce Wayne's funeral, Alfred
said something that stuck.

75
00:06:42,614 --> 00:06:43,823
A single twig breaks...

76
00:06:43,825 --> 00:06:45,639
But the bundle of twigs
is strong.

77
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,133
You're not alone.

78
00:06:47,329 --> 00:06:48,306
Let me help you.

79
00:06:48,326 --> 00:06:51,682
I don't want to bury Bruce Wayne
and Batman for real this time.

80
00:06:51,693 --> 00:06:53,168
I don't intend to lose.

81
00:07:01,283 --> 00:07:03,124
Barbara, I need you
to get the vehicle

82
00:07:03,144 --> 00:07:04,992
and meet me at the entrance
to the Cauldron.

83
00:07:19,615 --> 00:07:21,269
I'm disappointed.

84
00:07:21,271 --> 00:07:25,920
I thought we were cohorts,
collaborators, partners.

85
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,190
Two's a partnership,
three's a liability.

86
00:07:32,302 --> 00:07:33,383
"Three"?

87
00:07:33,504 --> 00:07:35,988
It appears
we're not only parting ways,

88
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,229
but minds as well.

89
00:07:48,382 --> 00:07:50,037
Why the long face?

90
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:51,449
Or, in your case,

91
00:07:51,663 --> 00:07:52,877
two face.

92
00:07:53,164 --> 00:07:56,530
Didn't you realize I could kill
you as easily I created you?

93
00:07:59,362 --> 00:08:00,729
Freeze, Anarky!

94
00:08:01,035 --> 00:08:02,127
Ow!

95
00:08:02,591 --> 00:08:04,546
Way to wreck the moment, Gordon.

96
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:07,718
Welcome to the game, Harv.

97
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:13,246
Are you hurt?

98
00:08:13,477 --> 00:08:15,069
I'm fine!

99
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,647
Better than fine!

100
00:08:17,637 --> 00:08:19,546
You've always been
a boy scout, Gordon.

101
00:08:19,548 --> 00:08:21,713
You should think about
running for Mayor.

102
00:08:21,715 --> 00:08:23,288
We aren't interested anymore.

103
00:08:23,817 --> 00:08:25,121
See you around.

104
00:08:26,015 --> 00:08:26,945
"We"?

105
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,574
<i>Before we begin,</i>

106
00:08:45,575 --> 00:08:50,079
<i>i want to apologize</i> <i>for the Dane Lisslow
charade and his explosive finale.</i>

107
00:08:50,482 --> 00:08:51,818
<i>Did you like the body?</i>

108
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,727
<i>Something I picked up</i>
<i>at the morgue.</i>

109
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:56,156
You're an assassin.

110
00:08:56,344 --> 00:08:58,082
Getting close to your prey
is your job.

111
00:08:58,351 --> 00:09:00,076
<i>Assassin? Yes.</i>

112
00:09:00,358 --> 00:09:01,652
<i>That is who I am.</i>

113
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:05,879
<i>That is all Alfred Pennyworth</i> <i>left
for me when he destroyed my life.</i>

114
00:09:06,762 --> 00:09:07,607
Huh?

115
00:09:07,832 --> 00:09:09,742
<i>You and your other self,</i>
<i>Bruce Wayne,</i>

116
00:09:09,819 --> 00:09:11,866
<i>have led an extraordinary</i>
<i>life, Batman.</i>

117
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:15,369
<i>Not unlike a life</i>
<i>i once saw for myself.</i>

118
00:09:16,396 --> 00:09:17,436
Where is he?

119
00:09:19,099 --> 00:09:20,341
Where is Alfred?

120
00:09:21,223 --> 00:09:22,921
<i>He's waiting for you.</i>

121
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:34,283
Well, what do
you think? Perfect?

122
00:09:34,423 --> 00:09:37,554
Perfect? Could you have found
something more conspicuous?

123
00:09:37,832 --> 00:09:40,110
It was the only vehicle
I could get the keys to.

124
00:09:41,337 --> 00:09:42,706
Here, put this on.

125
00:09:43,471 --> 00:09:45,527
From here on out, you're Oracle.

126
00:09:47,644 --> 00:09:50,527
Okay, but why the disguise
all of a sudden?

127
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,581
Because I brought along
some friends.

128
00:09:53,061 --> 00:09:54,622
You can come out now!

129
00:09:59,697 --> 00:10:00,715
Cool.

130
00:10:05,612 --> 00:10:07,321
<i> I knew</i>
<i>you'd come alone.</i>

131
00:10:08,097 --> 00:10:09,592
<i>Nice room, by the way.</i>

132
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,195
Let Alfred go. It's me you want.

133
00:10:19,898 --> 00:10:22,381
<i>No, this is about both of you.</i>

134
00:10:30,289 --> 00:10:34,193
It will truly be an honor when I
kill you and take your place.

135
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:39,238
Wake up, Batman.

136
00:10:39,562 --> 00:10:40,364
Wake up.

137
00:10:45,934 --> 00:10:46,912
Alfred.

138
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,713
He's gone,
but no doubt not for long.

139
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:50,747
What do we know?

140
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:52,838
He's cut the elevator cables

141
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,937
and destroyed the hydraulics
to the Batcave's entrance.

142
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,149
We're trapped in here.

143
00:10:58,454 --> 00:10:59,637
All three of us.

144
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:02,306
Your sons
have come home, Alfred.

145
00:11:03,392 --> 00:11:04,506
One, a hero,

146
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:05,972
one, a villain.

147
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,461
And tonight...

148
00:11:09,362 --> 00:11:11,173
You're gonna watch your son die.

149
00:11:11,691 --> 00:11:14,478
What happened between us
is in the past.

150
00:11:14,714 --> 00:11:16,790
Ah, yes, the past.

151
00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:18,536
You couldn't leave it alone.

152
00:11:18,538 --> 00:11:21,849
Had to start asking people
questions about Slade Wilson.

153
00:11:22,042 --> 00:11:25,621
People who don't like former MI6
agents snooping in their business.

154
00:11:25,737 --> 00:11:28,040
People who began to think
I'd been compromised!

155
00:11:28,191 --> 00:11:29,935
People who tried to kill me!

156
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:34,210
I was trying to make amends
for what happened years ago.

157
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:37,102
CIA burned me because of you.

158
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:39,913
I lost my family, my life.

159
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,124
And you replace me with this?

160
00:11:43,482 --> 00:11:45,214
A spoiled, rich boy?

161
00:11:46,095 --> 00:11:47,066
Was it the money?

162
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,562
You saw a sucker in Wayne
and you dug in?

163
00:11:49,944 --> 00:11:51,472
I chose Bruce

164
00:11:51,474 --> 00:11:55,232
because I saw in him what I never
saw in you, Slade, empathy.

165
00:11:55,233 --> 00:11:57,939
Compassion for
other human beings.

166
00:11:57,941 --> 00:11:59,373
Even at his worst,

167
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,667
Bruce Wayne and Batman

168
00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:03,894
are better men
than you ever were.

169
00:12:08,909 --> 00:12:09,860
Stop!

170
00:12:27,237 --> 00:12:30,421
One thing I discovered while I
was researching you, Batman.

171
00:12:30,423 --> 00:12:31,827
You always plan ahead.

172
00:12:32,493 --> 00:12:33,662
So do I.

173
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,696
You have an impressive
arsenal here.

174
00:12:37,001 --> 00:12:40,791
Although keeping so much C4 in
one place in very dangerous.

175
00:12:40,911 --> 00:12:43,351
I took the liberty of spreading
it throughout the cave.

176
00:12:43,515 --> 00:12:46,109
Those explosives go off,
you die, too.

177
00:12:46,574 --> 00:12:48,678
I'm going to give you
two choices.

178
00:12:49,091 --> 00:12:51,220
Lay down your life
with honor to me,

179
00:12:51,767 --> 00:12:54,086
or see everything
you built destroyed.

180
00:12:54,402 --> 00:12:56,240
You forgot the third choice.

181
00:13:06,644 --> 00:13:09,322
That detonator
has a 16-digit kill code.

182
00:13:09,427 --> 00:13:11,130
Only I can stop the timer.

183
00:13:11,231 --> 00:13:12,886
Then I'll just
have to convince you.

184
00:13:57,979 --> 00:14:01,015
We're still sealed in here
with that C4 to contend with.

185
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:02,570
There's another way.

186
00:14:06,395 --> 00:14:08,401
I can override
the door manually.

187
00:14:44,662 --> 00:14:46,477
No. He's mine.

188
00:14:46,701 --> 00:14:49,694
The Batcave's been rigged with explosives.
Not much time.

189
00:14:49,695 --> 00:14:50,574
We're on it.

190
00:14:56,608 --> 00:14:58,495
Please tell me
that's not how long we have.

191
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:01,478
Deathstroke has
planted C4 all over the cave

192
00:15:01,482 --> 00:15:04,677
and locked his detonator
with a 16-digit kill code.

193
00:15:04,828 --> 00:15:06,471
Detonator? Where is it?

194
00:15:06,598 --> 00:15:09,591
It was knocked away.
In the corner, I think.

195
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:12,748
Nice pad.

196
00:15:12,888 --> 00:15:14,701
This is my second time here.

197
00:15:14,895 --> 00:15:16,596
Well, aren't you special!

198
00:15:17,957 --> 00:15:18,750
Found it.

199
00:15:21,685 --> 00:15:23,015
Oracle, what are you doing?

200
00:15:23,437 --> 00:15:25,506
Detonators work on
frequency conversion.

201
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:26,684
If we can track the signal...

202
00:15:26,686 --> 00:15:29,081
We can find the bombs.
Clever girl.

203
00:15:32,485 --> 00:15:33,662
They're all over.

204
00:15:33,664 --> 00:15:34,968
We'll never get them in time.

205
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,154
Don't be so sure.

206
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:37,995
How much can you lift?

207
00:16:29,942 --> 00:16:32,904
It's fitting, the two of us,
brothers that we are,

208
00:16:32,905 --> 00:16:34,455
meeting our end together.

209
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:37,120
Where is your honor? Face me!

210
00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:40,243
You're not my brother!

211
00:16:42,097 --> 00:16:44,494
And you don't know
the first thing about honor.

212
00:17:10,033 --> 00:17:11,584
How do we disarm them?

213
00:17:14,461 --> 00:17:17,103
I... I just knew
how to find them.

214
00:17:19,781 --> 00:17:21,181
There's no time left.

215
00:17:21,628 --> 00:17:22,636
Stand back.

216
00:17:33,893 --> 00:17:35,309
You're too late.

217
00:17:55,249 --> 00:17:56,254
Metamorpho?

218
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:57,837
Ow.

219
00:18:03,204 --> 00:18:04,395
You're done.

220
00:18:04,732 --> 00:18:05,954
Perhaps.

221
00:18:06,358 --> 00:18:07,765
But so are you.

222
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,232
Or have you forgotten?

223
00:18:09,653 --> 00:18:11,337
I know your secret...

224
00:18:11,721 --> 00:18:12,769
Bruce.

225
00:18:19,018 --> 00:18:20,514
Don't move.

226
00:18:23,287 --> 00:18:25,459
As soon as we hand him
over to Gotham PD,

227
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:27,066
he'll reveal Bruce Wayne.

228
00:18:27,301 --> 00:18:28,617
It's over, Alfred.

229
00:18:31,602 --> 00:18:32,961
Perhaps not.

230
00:18:35,107 --> 00:18:37,479
Batman protects this city.

231
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,540
He's protected all of you
at one time.

232
00:18:40,844 --> 00:18:43,929
If the truth of who he is
beneath the mask is revealed,

233
00:18:43,931 --> 00:18:45,257
that will end.

234
00:18:45,778 --> 00:18:46,824
What can we do?

235
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:48,231
You're a scientist

236
00:18:48,233 --> 00:18:50,154
and you can generate
any element.

237
00:18:51,386 --> 00:18:52,782
Can you erase his mind?

238
00:18:54,221 --> 00:18:55,381
Intriguing.

239
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:59,753
Uh, there is an enzyme, PKM-Zeta.

240
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,368
Give me its properties.

241
00:19:03,282 --> 00:19:04,646
I can't let you do this.

242
00:19:04,735 --> 00:19:06,464
This isn't just about Batman.

243
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,854
It's about Gotham,

244
00:19:08,007 --> 00:19:11,669
and these outsiders who've risked their
lives to help you continue your fight.

245
00:19:15,965 --> 00:19:17,449
Stand clear, everyone.

246
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:42,432
Where am I?

247
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:45,903
What are you people?

248
00:19:47,151 --> 00:19:48,371
Well, that worked.

249
00:19:49,444 --> 00:19:50,953
You're back in business.

250
00:19:51,165 --> 00:19:52,301
Not just me.

251
00:19:53,004 --> 00:19:53,957
We.

252
00:19:56,357 --> 00:19:57,528
I'm not alone.

253
00:19:58,933 --> 00:20:00,204
Not anymore.

254
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,610
Bravo, Batman.

255
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:17,055
Checkmate.

256
00:20:17,352 --> 00:20:19,580
Shall we play again?

257
00:20:21,477 --> 00:20:25,299
