1
00:00:22,601 --> 00:00:24,728  X1:302 X2:415 Y1:384 Y2:419
Justin.

2
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,995  X1:192 X2:529 Y1:352 Y2:419
I just thought I'd stop by
and say goodbye.

3
00:00:28,173 --> 00:00:31,904  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:356 Y2:419
I heard you were going
back to Smallville tomorrow.

4
00:00:32,711 --> 00:00:35,441  X1:243 X2:474 Y1:382 Y2:419
Yeah, Smallville.

5
00:00:36,715 --> 00:00:38,114  X1:249 X2:470 Y1:380 Y2:419
How's it going?

6
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:48,893  X1:270 X2:447 Y1:384 Y2:419
You tell me.

7
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:53,728  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:352 Y2:419
You've been here five months.
You've come a long way.

8
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:55,992  X1:121 X2:596 Y1:380 Y2:419
Your body has done a lot of healing.

9
00:00:56,535 --> 00:00:59,197  X1:215 X2:503 Y1:380 Y2:419
Except for my hands.

10
00:01:01,006 --> 00:01:03,440  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:352 Y2:419
They'll never get better
and I'll never draw again...

11
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:06,669  X1:181 X2:538 Y1:352 Y2:419
...and that's the only thing
I was ever good at.

12
00:01:06,845 --> 00:01:11,680  X1:094 X2:624 Y1:352 Y2:419
You suffer severe nerve damage. It's
lucky you have movement in your hands.

13
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,614  X1:097 X2:621 Y1:352 Y2:419
- I did everything I could, you know that.
- Really?

14
00:01:14,786 --> 00:01:19,450  X1:098 X2:621 Y1:352 Y2:419
Is that what you told the five patients
who filed malpractice suits against you?

15
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:22,719  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:352 Y2:419
Now, I can understand
your still being angry...

16
00:01:22,894 --> 00:01:25,328  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:352 Y2:419
...but blaming me isn't
gonna change your condition.

17
00:01:25,497 --> 00:01:28,694  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:352 Y2:419
You were in an accident
and you have to accept that.

18
00:01:28,867 --> 00:01:31,028  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:384 Y2:419
I was in a hit-and-run.

19
00:01:32,504 --> 00:01:36,497  X1:142 X2:576 Y1:356 Y2:419
You know, when I was your age,
I wanted to be a violinist.

20
00:01:36,675 --> 00:01:41,009  X1:142 X2:576 Y1:356 Y2:419
So I applied to the Conservatory,
but I failed the audition.

21
00:01:41,179 --> 00:01:44,842  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:352 Y2:419
The instructor told me
that I had the hands of a surgeon...

22
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,010  X1:097 X2:623 Y1:380 Y2:419
...and that's why I moved into medicine.

23
00:01:48,186 --> 00:01:50,416  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:384 Y2:419
As one door closes...

24
00:01:50,589 --> 00:01:53,422  X1:215 X2:504 Y1:380 Y2:419
...another one opens.

25
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:57,260  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:352 Y2:419
You're young,
you'll find something new.

26
00:01:58,797 --> 00:02:01,163  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:380 Y2:419
Goodbye, Justin.

27
00:02:05,604 --> 00:02:07,902  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:382 Y2:419
Have a nice life, Dr. Wells.

28
00:02:10,475 --> 00:02:13,501  X1:203 X2:516 Y1:380 Y2:419
Rene, honey, I'm sorry.

29
00:02:13,679 --> 00:02:16,978  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:352 Y2:419
- Another ungrateful patient?
- Aren't they all?

30
00:02:17,149 --> 00:02:21,142  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:352 Y2:419
- So you think he'll sue?
- He doesn't have any proof.

31
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:25,255  X1:115 X2:604 Y1:380 Y2:419
He's alive, he should be thanking me.

32
00:02:35,967 --> 00:02:37,628  X1:237 X2:481 Y1:380 Y2:419
What's going on?

33
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,845  X1:281 X2:437 Y1:380 Y2:419
You okay?

34
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,153  X1:104 X2:614 Y1:380 Y2:419
Get us out of here! Hurry up! Come on!

35
00:03:00,258 --> 00:03:03,625  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:352 Y2:419
Get us out of here now. Get us
out of here now! Hurry up! Come on!

36
00:03:06,698 --> 00:03:08,461  X1:290 X2:428 Y1:352 Y2:419
- Help!
- Help us!

37
00:03:10,435 --> 00:03:12,096  X1:288 X2:429 Y1:384 Y2:419
That's it.

38
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:15,205  X1:221 X2:497 Y1:352 Y2:419
- Give me a hand up.
- All right.

39
00:03:37,863 --> 00:03:40,229  X1:211 X2:507 Y1:380 Y2:419
Okay, grab my hands.

40
00:05:03,582 --> 00:05:06,210  X1:169 X2:550 Y1:062 Y2:101
I see you in a uniform flying.

41
00:05:06,384 --> 00:05:09,080  X1:189 X2:530 Y1:062 Y2:124
Have you ever considered
a career in the Air Force?

42
00:05:09,254 --> 00:05:11,620  X1:238 X2:480 Y1:062 Y2:096
I'll think about it.

43
00:05:15,193 --> 00:05:17,093  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:062 Y2:101
What are you smiling about?

44
00:05:17,262 --> 00:05:20,754  X1:100 X2:620 Y1:062 Y2:129
I landed a summer job at Mayor Siegel's
working on his re-election campaign.

45
00:05:20,932 --> 00:05:23,162  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:062 Y2:128
I thought you were helping
your mom at the court.

46
00:05:23,335 --> 00:05:26,862  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:062 Y2:128
Judge Ross can get some KSU
students to schlep her files.

47
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:29,598  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:062 Y2:128
Who wants to hang out with
their parents all summer?

48
00:05:29,774 --> 00:05:31,765  X1:264 X2:454 Y1:062 Y2:128
- Yeah.
- Sorry, Clark.

49
00:05:31,943 --> 00:05:35,037  X1:165 X2:554 Y1:062 Y2:124
Did you notice Kwan's son
down at the Air Force booth?

50
00:05:35,213 --> 00:05:39,081  X1:095 X2:622 Y1:062 Y2:124
Growing up with Kwan,
the Air Force would seem like Club Med.

51
00:05:39,384 --> 00:05:42,683  X1:112 X2:605 Y1:062 Y2:129
- Wow, you look nice.
- Thanks, I was going for professional.

52
00:05:42,854 --> 00:05:46,756  X1:094 X2:626 Y1:062 Y2:129
Did you know the <i>Daily Planet</i> only takes
four high school interns from the state?

53
00:05:46,925 --> 00:05:48,916  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:356 Y2:419
- You're a shoo-in, Chloe.
- Tell him that.

54
00:05:49,094 --> 00:05:52,086  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:352 Y2:419
He said they received
over 500 applicants last year.

55
00:05:52,264 --> 00:05:55,165  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:062 Y2:128
- I doubt I'll get an interview.
- There's always the <i>Inquisitor. </i>

56
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:58,234  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:062 Y2:129
- Didn't Lex offer to hook you up?
- I'm interning at the <i>Planet. </i>

57
00:05:58,403 --> 00:06:00,701  X1:127 X2:591 Y1:062 Y2:101
I don't care if it's delivering coffee.

58
00:06:00,872 --> 00:06:03,705  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:062 Y2:128
Why don't you try again Saturday
when you're in Metropolis?

59
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,571  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:062 Y2:101
Why are you going to Metropolis?

60
00:06:08,446 --> 00:06:10,744  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:062 Y2:101
We're going to Metropolis, Clark.

61
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:13,680  X1:127 X2:592 Y1:062 Y2:100
The student journalism conference?

62
00:06:13,852 --> 00:06:17,982  X1:090 X2:629 Y1:352 Y2:419
You were supposed to sign us up. I know
you didn't forget. It's too late to get in.

63
00:06:18,156 --> 00:06:22,650  X1:103 X2:614 Y1:352 Y2:419
Sorry. I've been at the Talon all week
with Lana working on a history project.

64
00:06:22,827 --> 00:06:26,285  X1:094 X2:624 Y1:354 Y2:419
- Everything else becomes less important.
- Whoa, that's not true.

65
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:30,427  X1:156 X2:564 Y1:352 Y2:419
How much time have we spent
together in three weeks?

66
00:06:30,602 --> 00:06:33,867  X1:089 X2:629 Y1:352 Y2:419
- We see each other every day.
- It was 45 minutes. My car broke down...

67
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:36,269  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:352 Y2:419
...outside the Talon
and you gave me a ride home.

68
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:40,070  X1:119 X2:600 Y1:352 Y2:419
- I had to tear you away from Lana.
- Don't you think you're being unfair?

69
00:06:40,245 --> 00:06:43,043  X1:101 X2:618 Y1:356 Y2:419
No! Whenever Lex and Lana are around,
no one else exists.

70
00:06:43,381 --> 00:06:46,782  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:352 Y2:419
Wait, Chloe, why are you being
so hypersensitive?

71
00:06:46,952 --> 00:06:52,481  X1:091 X2:628 Y1:352 Y2:419
Most men are from Mars, but you're from
a distant galaxy I've never heard of.

72
00:06:53,892 --> 00:06:56,486  X1:147 X2:572 Y1:352 Y2:419
I know I screwed up, but why is
Chloe having a breakdown?

73
00:06:56,661 --> 00:07:00,119  X1:104 X2:614 Y1:352 Y2:419
- You're not the most observant person.
- What are you talking about?

74
00:07:00,298 --> 00:07:05,429  X1:088 X2:631 Y1:352 Y2:419
She wanted to spend a day with you. She
was gonna ask you to the spring formal.

75
00:07:05,603 --> 00:07:07,434  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:382 Y2:419
Yeah, but that'd be like...

76
00:07:07,605 --> 00:07:09,596  X1:311 X2:409 Y1:384 Y2:419
Date?

77
00:07:10,141 --> 00:07:14,373  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:352 Y2:419
Maybe if you took off your Lana
blinders, you'd realize Chloe likes you.

78
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,545  X1:104 X2:613 Y1:380 Y2:419
Clark, I'm not interested in an apology.

79
00:07:24,723 --> 00:07:27,954  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:352 Y2:419
- Not the welcome I was expecting, hi.
- Hey!

80
00:07:28,126 --> 00:07:30,720  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:352 Y2:419
How are you? It's good to see you.
When did you get back?

81
00:07:30,895 --> 00:07:35,332  X1:096 X2:623 Y1:352 Y2:419
Yesterday. I just wanted to thank you,
by the way, for sending all those emails.

82
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:40,096  X1:112 X2:606 Y1:352 Y2:419
- They got me through a tough time.
- I'm sure lots of people kept in touch.

83
00:07:40,271 --> 00:07:43,536  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:352 Y2:419
For most of my friends,
it was out of sight, out of mind.

84
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:47,041  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:352 Y2:419
I know the feeling. So when can you
start drawing your cartoon again?

85
00:07:47,212 --> 00:07:51,615  X1:098 X2:622 Y1:352 Y2:419
Everybody's been waiting for the further
adventures of the flaming crow's feet.

86
00:07:55,987 --> 00:07:58,285  X1:187 X2:532 Y1:356 Y2:419
Unfortunately my drawing
hand's kind of shot.

87
00:07:59,124 --> 00:08:02,150  X1:255 X2:462 Y1:352 Y2:419
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

88
00:08:02,627 --> 00:08:06,119  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:352 Y2:419
I'm in the process
of re-evaluating my life.

89
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:12,533  X1:094 X2:623 Y1:352 Y2:419
So listen, is there any chance that
maybe I could buy you a cup of coffee...

90
00:08:12,704 --> 00:08:16,196  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:352 Y2:419
...or one of those nonfat,
no-foam lattes that you like?

91
00:08:20,378 --> 00:08:25,042  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:352 Y2:419
Yeah, why not? I'm in the process
of re-evaluating my life too.

92
00:08:29,587 --> 00:08:30,952  X1:291 X2:427 Y1:380 Y2:419
Let's go.

93
00:08:57,515 --> 00:08:59,506  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:380 Y2:419
What are you doing here?

94
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:05,246  X1:115 X2:603 Y1:380 Y2:419
I'm here for the same reason you are.

95
00:09:06,224 --> 00:09:10,854  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:352 Y2:419
- The anniversary of her death.
- It's been nine years.

96
00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:13,490  X1:096 X2:623 Y1:380 Y2:419
Why the sudden burst of sentimentality?

97
00:09:13,832 --> 00:09:16,494  X1:149 X2:570 Y1:352 Y2:419
I deserve that, just disappearing
from your life.

98
00:09:16,668 --> 00:09:19,762  X1:139 X2:581 Y1:352 Y2:419
I'm sure all that LuthorCorp stock
my mother left you helped.

99
00:09:19,938 --> 00:09:22,566  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:380 Y2:419
Is that what your father told you?

100
00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:26,772  X1:102 X2:615 Y1:380 Y2:419
All those years I thought you loved me.

101
00:09:28,513 --> 00:09:30,845  X1:114 X2:604 Y1:380 Y2:419
But you were just in it for the money.

102
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:37,747  X1:110 X2:608 Y1:352 Y2:419
I know you're angry and you have
every right to be, but we need to talk.

103
00:09:40,391 --> 00:09:44,054  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:352 Y2:419
I can't believe there's anything
you'd say that would interest me.

104
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,921  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:380 Y2:419
Goodbye, Pamela.

105
00:09:56,674 --> 00:09:58,198  X1:172 X2:546 Y1:380 Y2:419
This one's my favorite strip.

106
00:09:58,376 --> 00:09:59,934  X1:299 X2:418 Y1:356 Y2:419
- Really.
- Yes.

107
00:10:00,111 --> 00:10:01,510  X1:280 X2:438 Y1:380 Y2:419
Hey, guys.

108
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:03,408  X1:233 X2:485 Y1:356 Y2:419
- Hey.
- You know Justin.

109
00:10:03,581 --> 00:10:06,880  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:352 Y2:419
Yeah. Of course, welcome back.
How are you feeling?

110
00:10:07,051 --> 00:10:11,112  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:352 Y2:419
Oh, just kind of taking it
one day at a time.

111
00:10:11,923 --> 00:10:13,754  X1:120 X2:600 Y1:380 Y2:419
Did they find the driver who hit you?

112
00:10:13,925 --> 00:10:17,986  X1:089 X2:629 Y1:352 Y2:419
No. No, I couldn't give the police much. I
didn't remember anything for a long time.

113
00:10:18,363 --> 00:10:20,490  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:380 Y2:419
Well, what do you remember?

114
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:24,829  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:354 Y2:419
- A little bit of the license plate. DDI.
- Well, we should look into it.

115
00:10:25,003 --> 00:10:27,904  X1:105 X2:612 Y1:352 Y2:419
- Call the police.
- Lf we find something, we'll pass it on.

116
00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:33,367  X1:309 X2:408 Y1:380 Y2:419
Okay.

117
00:10:35,413 --> 00:10:38,678  X1:110 X2:608 Y1:356 Y2:419
Anyway, I talked to Lex. He scored us
two tickets to the conference.

118
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:42,247  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:352 Y2:419
Don't worry about it. Justin's
signed up so I'm going as his guest.

119
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,011  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:356 Y2:419
- Yeah, or we could all go together.
- No.

120
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:49,059  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:352 Y2:419
Clark's not that interested
in journalism anyway.

121
00:10:51,396 --> 00:10:55,127  X1:162 X2:558 Y1:352 Y2:419
Right, okay. I should probably
get going, listen...

122
00:11:07,545 --> 00:11:09,308  X1:276 X2:441 Y1:380 Y2:419
Thank you.

123
00:11:17,655 --> 00:11:19,850  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:352 Y2:419
- Hi.
- Hey, Clark. Is your mom around?

124
00:11:20,024 --> 00:11:23,721  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:352 Y2:419
- I wanted to order more of her pies.
- She's in class, I can help you.

125
00:11:23,895 --> 00:11:26,955  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:352 Y2:419
I thought you'd be helping
Chloe proof the latest edition.

126
00:11:27,131 --> 00:11:30,498  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:352 Y2:419
- She had enough help.
- Are you two still fighting?

127
00:11:30,668 --> 00:11:32,568  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:380 Y2:419
Who said we were fighting?

128
00:11:32,737 --> 00:11:37,674  X1:097 X2:622 Y1:352 Y2:419
Kind of caught it yesterday at the career
fair. What's going on with you two?

129
00:11:39,344 --> 00:11:41,005  X1:251 X2:467 Y1:384 Y2:419
Chloe likes me.

130
00:11:42,146 --> 00:11:44,239  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:380 Y2:419
So how do you feel about her?

131
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,944  X1:198 X2:522 Y1:356 Y2:419
Like maybe we could be
more than friends.

132
00:11:50,288 --> 00:11:53,780  X1:117 X2:602 Y1:356 Y2:419
- I saw her with Justin. I got kind of...
- Jealous?

133
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,818  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:352 Y2:419
It's like you find out this secret
and it colors everything.

134
00:11:59,664 --> 00:12:02,155  X1:099 X2:617 Y1:384 Y2:419
Just can't believe I never saw it before.

135
00:12:02,634 --> 00:12:07,333  X1:102 X2:615 Y1:352 Y2:419
Sometimes the right person can be in
front of your eyes and you never know.

136
00:12:15,847 --> 00:12:19,943  X1:137 X2:582 Y1:356 Y2:419
- So how many pies did you want?
- A dozen.

137
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,412  X1:161 X2:558 Y1:352 Y2:419
How's Whitney?
I hear his dad's feeling better.

138
00:12:26,357 --> 00:12:28,348  X1:278 X2:440 Y1:380 Y2:419
He's great.

139
00:12:29,927 --> 00:12:31,554  X1:242 X2:478 Y1:380 Y2:419
Everything okay?

140
00:12:32,797 --> 00:12:34,230  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:384 Y2:419
Never better.

141
00:12:37,435 --> 00:12:40,802  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:356 Y2:419
Good luck. I hope things
work out with Chloe.

142
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,064  X1:298 X2:421 Y1:384 Y2:419
Me too.

143
00:12:44,642 --> 00:12:46,041  X1:319 X2:400 Y1:380 Y2:419
Bye.

144
00:13:14,672 --> 00:13:16,299  X1:293 X2:425 Y1:384 Y2:419
Damn it.

145
00:14:03,654 --> 00:14:05,519  X1:314 X2:404 Y1:384 Y2:419
Pete.

146
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,783  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:352 Y2:419
- Hey.
- Hey, you seen Chloe?

147
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:11,588  X1:141 X2:580 Y1:352 Y2:419
Not since English. She's probably
hanging out with Justin.

148
00:14:13,131 --> 00:14:16,897  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:352 Y2:419
- What do you think about that guy?
- He seems pretty cool.

149
00:14:17,068 --> 00:14:21,232  X1:099 X2:620 Y1:352 Y2:419
Never got to know him that well before,
he was always buried in a sketchpad.

150
00:14:21,406 --> 00:14:23,271  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:384 Y2:419
Chloe seems to like him.

151
00:14:23,441 --> 00:14:25,773  X1:185 X2:534 Y1:352 Y2:419
Careful, Clark, you almost
sound a little jealous.

152
00:14:25,943 --> 00:14:28,104  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:380 Y2:419
I'm not jealous, I'm concerned.

153
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:31,476  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:352 Y2:419
Why, because Chloe's falling for a
nice guy? It's got me worried too.

154
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:32,980  X1:312 X2:407 Y1:384 Y2:419
Look.

155
00:14:33,718 --> 00:14:36,551  X1:215 X2:502 Y1:062 Y2:128
Justin had this in his
portfolio yesterday.

156
00:14:37,922 --> 00:14:41,824  X1:175 X2:544 Y1:062 Y2:124
"Going Down. Doctor Loses
Hands in Freak Accident."

157
00:14:41,993 --> 00:14:44,860  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:356 Y2:419
- So?
- That was Justin's doctor.

158
00:14:45,363 --> 00:14:47,490  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:352 Y2:419
Don't you think it's weird
he's carrying that?

159
00:14:47,999 --> 00:14:50,524  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:380 Y2:419
I liked the tragic irony.

160
00:14:51,569 --> 00:14:53,730  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:356 Y2:419
You always talk about people
behind their backs?

161
00:14:53,905 --> 00:14:55,805  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:352 Y2:419
- Justin, I didn't mean...
- Yes, you did.

162
00:14:55,973 --> 00:15:00,706  X1:085 X2:635 Y1:352 Y2:419
I start spending time with Chloe, suddenly
you realize she exists and want me out?

163
00:15:00,878 --> 00:15:04,780  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:352 Y2:419
- Chloe and I are just friends.
- You had your chance with her.

164
00:15:05,283 --> 00:15:07,615  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:380 Y2:419
Now you let me have mine.

165
00:15:24,001 --> 00:15:26,469  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:380 Y2:419
What the hell are you doing here?

166
00:15:31,108 --> 00:15:34,600  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:352 Y2:419
I wanted to see what kind
of young man you'd grown into.

167
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:36,679  X1:241 X2:477 Y1:380 Y2:419
A very busy one.

168
00:15:37,815 --> 00:15:39,407  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:380 Y2:419
So if there's nothing else...

169
00:15:39,584 --> 00:15:43,611  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:352 Y2:419
We were close once, Alexander,
you were like a son to me.

170
00:15:43,788 --> 00:15:46,518  X1:125 X2:593 Y1:352 Y2:419
You were an employee.
You were paid to watch me while...

171
00:15:46,691 --> 00:15:51,128  X1:087 X2:633 Y1:352 Y2:419
...my mother's health failed and my father
crisscrossed the globe on business.

172
00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:53,593  X1:195 X2:524 Y1:380 Y2:419
I loved you like my own.

173
00:15:53,764 --> 00:15:58,667  X1:102 X2:617 Y1:352 Y2:419
After the meteor shower, I was the one
who never looked at you differently.

174
00:16:00,004 --> 00:16:02,438  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:352 Y2:419
Just because you knew me
at a vulnerable point...

175
00:16:02,607 --> 00:16:05,474  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:356 Y2:419
...doesn't give you the right
to waltz back in a decade later.

176
00:16:06,577 --> 00:16:12,038  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:352 Y2:419
Things have changed. I've changed.
What do you want from me?

177
00:16:12,216 --> 00:16:14,844  X1:209 X2:508 Y1:352 Y2:419
I want you to know
what really happened.

178
00:16:16,053 --> 00:16:19,648  X1:096 X2:622 Y1:354 Y2:419
- You lied to my mother on her deathbed.
- No, I didn't.

179
00:16:19,824 --> 00:16:23,316  X1:149 X2:570 Y1:352 Y2:419
I had every intention of staying,
but your father sent me away.

180
00:16:23,494 --> 00:16:26,986  X1:157 X2:562 Y1:356 Y2:419
After the funeral, he called me
into his office and told me...

181
00:16:27,164 --> 00:16:31,157  X1:114 X2:606 Y1:352 Y2:419
...if I ever had contact with you again
that he would disinherit you.

182
00:16:31,335 --> 00:16:32,825  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:380 Y2:419
Why would he do that?

183
00:16:33,004 --> 00:16:36,735  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:354 Y2:419
Because he wanted you
to be his son, not hers.

184
00:16:36,908 --> 00:16:38,967  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:380 Y2:419
So why show up now?

185
00:16:40,211 --> 00:16:44,272  X1:159 X2:561 Y1:352 Y2:419
Does the statute of limitations
on my father's threat expire?

186
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:48,546  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:352 Y2:419
I needed to see if you'd found
a way to be true to yourself...

187
00:16:48,719 --> 00:16:51,085  X1:170 X2:550 Y1:380 Y2:419
...in spite of Lionel's efforts.

188
00:16:53,591 --> 00:16:58,927  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:352 Y2:419
And to be honest,
I wanted your forgiveness.

189
00:17:02,266 --> 00:17:06,362  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:352 Y2:419
I'm afraid you'll have to find
a way to grant it to yourself.

190
00:17:11,108 --> 00:17:13,235  X1:217 X2:501 Y1:380 Y2:419
Goodbye, Alexander.

191
00:17:25,289 --> 00:17:28,383  X1:145 X2:574 Y1:352 Y2:419
I wish everything sold as well as
your mom's organic apple pies.

192
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,653  X1:213 X2:504 Y1:352 Y2:419
- Every little bit helps.
- Hey, Clark.

193
00:17:31,829 --> 00:17:36,857  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:352 Y2:419
- Hey, Whitney, how's your dad?
- On the mend. Happy to be home.

194
00:17:37,835 --> 00:17:39,735  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:380 Y2:419
Hey. Keep Saturday night free.

195
00:17:39,904 --> 00:17:42,532  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:352 Y2:419
Got two tickets to <i>Our Town</i>
at the Metropolis Playhouse.

196
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,409  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:352 Y2:419
- Wow. What inspired you to do that?
- Saw you reading it at school.

197
00:17:47,578 --> 00:17:50,342  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:356 Y2:419
Thought I might start making up
for some lost time.

198
00:17:52,516 --> 00:17:55,280  X1:287 X2:431 Y1:352 Y2:419
- See you.
- Bye.

199
00:18:00,992 --> 00:18:05,190  X1:090 X2:628 Y1:352 Y2:419
Whitney has paid more attention to me in
the last two weeks than he has all year.

200
00:18:05,363 --> 00:18:07,354  X1:145 X2:574 Y1:380 Y2:419
Have you talked to him about it?

201
00:18:07,632 --> 00:18:10,100  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:352 Y2:419
He's seemed so happy ever
since his dad got better.

202
00:18:10,267 --> 00:18:14,203  X1:101 X2:617 Y1:352 Y2:419
- He wants to pick up where we left off.
- How do you feel about that?

203
00:18:15,473 --> 00:18:18,169  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:352 Y2:419
After Mr. Fordman got sick,
Whitney needed me.

204
00:18:18,342 --> 00:18:22,972  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:356 Y2:419
Kind of defined our relationship.
Now we need to redefine it.

205
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,341  X1:159 X2:558 Y1:380 Y2:419
There's a lot of that going on.

206
00:18:26,217 --> 00:18:30,176  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:356 Y2:419
- How are things with Chloe?
- Unresolved.

207
00:18:31,322 --> 00:18:33,290  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:380 Y2:419
What are you gonna do?

208
00:18:33,457 --> 00:18:37,359  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:352 Y2:419
I don't know, just don't want
to lose a friend in the process.

209
00:18:37,528 --> 00:18:40,361  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:352 Y2:419
Once you've crossed that line,
you can't go back.

210
00:18:41,966 --> 00:18:46,528  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:356 Y2:419
Chloe gave that same advice
about someone else.

211
00:18:47,371 --> 00:18:49,362  X1:243 X2:476 Y1:380 Y2:419
What happened?

212
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:55,035  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:352 Y2:419
- Decided to stay friends.
- Do you regret that decision?

213
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:01,784  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:352 Y2:419
Yeah. I let that moment slip away
and I don't think I'll ever get it back.

214
00:19:03,721 --> 00:19:06,087  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:356 Y2:419
I don't want to make
that same mistake twice.

215
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:20,531  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:352 Y2:419
Hey. I just emailed the partial license
plate details of your hit-and-run...

216
00:19:20,705 --> 00:19:24,163  X1:105 X2:615 Y1:352 Y2:419
...to my contact at the DMV. I told him
to start with cars in the county.

217
00:19:24,341 --> 00:19:27,833  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:356 Y2:419
He said that he would fax me
whatever information he found.

218
00:19:28,479 --> 00:19:30,071  X1:309 X2:409 Y1:384 Y2:419
Wow.

219
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:35,052  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:380 Y2:419
Oh, here, it took me all night.

220
00:19:39,623 --> 00:19:41,454  X1:284 X2:433 Y1:382 Y2:419
Oh, wow.

221
00:19:42,893 --> 00:19:46,659  X1:236 X2:481 Y1:352 Y2:419
- It's beautiful.
- Well, so are you.

222
00:19:49,366 --> 00:19:53,359  X1:104 X2:615 Y1:352 Y2:419
Did you know that after that car hit me
and I was lying in the road...

223
00:19:53,537 --> 00:19:58,167  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:352 Y2:419
...I kept picturing your face?
- Me? Why me?

224
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:01,701  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:352 Y2:419
Because I always had
the biggest crush on you.

225
00:20:01,879 --> 00:20:06,816  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:352 Y2:419
And I was too afraid to do anything.
I thought, here I am about to die...

226
00:20:06,984 --> 00:20:10,317  X1:160 X2:561 Y1:356 Y2:419
...and I'm never gonna get the
chance to tell her how I feel.

227
00:20:10,921 --> 00:20:14,652  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:352 Y2:419
But when you started emailing me
when I was in the hospital...

228
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:21,027  X1:098 X2:619 Y1:352 Y2:419
...I knew that this was my chance and I
wasn't going to let you get away twice.

229
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,238  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:380 Y2:419
I fought my way back for you.

230
00:21:00,971 --> 00:21:02,836  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:380 Y2:419
What just happened?

231
00:21:03,908 --> 00:21:06,843  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:356 Y2:419
- Can you keep an open mind?
- Sure.

232
00:21:07,778 --> 00:21:09,973  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:356 Y2:419
Something happened to me
after the accident...

233
00:21:10,147 --> 00:21:13,605  X1:143 X2:576 Y1:352 Y2:419
...and when I was in the hospital
I found that I could move things.

234
00:21:14,785 --> 00:21:17,948  X1:240 X2:478 Y1:356 Y2:419
- With my mind.
- Like telekinesis?

235
00:21:19,557 --> 00:21:21,718  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:380 Y2:419
Am I freaking you out?

236
00:21:22,626 --> 00:21:25,959  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:352 Y2:419
Believe it or not,
I have seen stranger things.

237
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:29,896  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:352 Y2:419
Because I don't want
to end up on your wall.

238
00:21:30,067 --> 00:21:35,937  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:352 Y2:419
Don't worry, you won't. Now,
let's make everything float again.

239
00:21:40,311 --> 00:21:42,279  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:380 Y2:419
Hey, Chloe, can l...?

240
00:21:48,719 --> 00:21:52,917  X1:101 X2:617 Y1:354 Y2:419
- Can I talk to you outside for a second?
- Yeah, sure, Clark.

241
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:55,422  X1:235 X2:482 Y1:352 Y2:419
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

242
00:22:15,112 --> 00:22:18,047  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:352 Y2:419
Don't you think this Justin
thing is moving a little too fast?

243
00:22:18,215 --> 00:22:22,584  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:352 Y2:419
We've been emailing for six months.
I know him better than I know you.

244
00:22:23,387 --> 00:22:25,821  X1:089 X2:630 Y1:356 Y2:419
- Did he say what happened to his doctor?
- No.

245
00:22:26,323 --> 00:22:29,554  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:352 Y2:419
But he did tell me that you were
talking about him behind his back.

246
00:22:29,727 --> 00:22:33,128  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:352 Y2:419
- I was just looking out for you, Chloe.
- What's with you, Clark?

247
00:22:33,297 --> 00:22:34,958  X1:131 X2:589 Y1:380 Y2:419
Do you have some savior complex?

248
00:22:35,132 --> 00:22:39,592  X1:094 X2:623 Y1:352 Y2:419
If I'm in trouble you'll rescue me. Other
than that you're emotionally unavailable.

249
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:43,262  X1:106 X2:612 Y1:352 Y2:419
I just don't want you getting involved
with Justin because you're mad at me.

250
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,705  X1:143 X2:576 Y1:352 Y2:419
Believe it or not, Clark, my world
does not revolve around you.

251
00:22:46,877 --> 00:22:49,505  X1:165 X2:554 Y1:352 Y2:419
Why can't you accept that
I've found someone special...

252
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,979  X1:171 X2:549 Y1:356 Y2:419
...and unlike you, I'm willing
to take a chance?

253
00:23:20,744 --> 00:23:25,579  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:352 Y2:419
Just tell me one thing,
was it easy to lie to everybody?

254
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:31,317  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:352 Y2:419
- Justin? What are you doing here?
- Reliving old memories.

255
00:23:31,855 --> 00:23:34,016  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:380 Y2:419
I think you should go home.

256
00:23:37,661 --> 00:23:42,621  X1:097 X2:622 Y1:352 Y2:419
I was only halfway across the crosswalk
when your car came barreling around.

257
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,868  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:356 Y2:419
Hit me so hard, it felt
like I'd been broken in half.

258
00:23:46,337 --> 00:23:48,567  X1:101 X2:618 Y1:380 Y2:419
I don't know what you're talking about.

259
00:23:50,908 --> 00:23:54,071  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:352 Y2:419
I remember lying in the street,
blood dripping into my eyes...

260
00:23:54,244 --> 00:23:58,943  X1:122 X2:598 Y1:352 Y2:419
...watching your taillights disappear.
You didn't even bother to stop.

261
00:24:00,551 --> 00:24:02,416  X1:263 X2:455 Y1:384 Y2:419
It wasn't me.

262
00:24:11,562 --> 00:24:13,427  X1:193 X2:526 Y1:380 Y2:419
It started in the hospital.

263
00:24:13,597 --> 00:24:17,931  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:352 Y2:419
Maybe as a way to compensate for
the motor skills I'd lost in my hands.

264
00:24:19,203 --> 00:24:21,637  X1:108 X2:611 Y1:380 Y2:419
I was immobilized in a total body cast.

265
00:24:21,805 --> 00:24:24,706  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:352 Y2:419
Then I found that I could move
things just by thinking.

266
00:24:35,219 --> 00:24:37,779  X1:121 X2:598 Y1:380 Y2:419
But that didn't replace what I'd lost.

267
00:24:39,356 --> 00:24:41,950  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:380 Y2:419
Because nothing could ever do that.

268
00:24:48,432 --> 00:24:50,559  X1:253 X2:463 Y1:380 Y2:419
Justin, stop it!

269
00:24:50,934 --> 00:24:55,530  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:352 Y2:419
Do you know what it feels like
to be hit by a 2000-pound car?

270
00:25:26,303 --> 00:25:28,464  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:352 Y2:419
Hey, Lex, what are you
doing here so late?

271
00:25:28,639 --> 00:25:32,166  X1:106 X2:613 Y1:352 Y2:419
Came to talk to your parents about the
settlement. What are you reading?

272
00:25:38,415 --> 00:25:40,406  X1:195 X2:526 Y1:356 Y2:419
<i>Men are From Mars, </i>
<i>Women are From venus</i>?

273
00:25:40,584 --> 00:25:43,610  X1:181 X2:539 Y1:352 Y2:419
I'm trying to get an insight
into the female psyche.

274
00:25:43,787 --> 00:25:48,588  X1:165 X2:555 Y1:062 Y2:128
I seriously doubt you'll find it
in here. What's the problem?

275
00:25:49,726 --> 00:25:53,457  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:352 Y2:419
I've got these two amazing friends
who both happen to be girls.

276
00:25:54,631 --> 00:25:58,567  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:356 Y2:419
For argument's sake,
let's call them Lana and Chloe.

277
00:25:59,236 --> 00:26:02,865  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:352 Y2:419
I've always liked Lana,
but I could never get near her.

278
00:26:03,273 --> 00:26:06,265  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:352 Y2:419
I found out that Chloe likes me,
I may have feelings for her too.

279
00:26:06,443 --> 00:26:07,910  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:380 Y2:419
Which one do you want to pursue?

280
00:26:08,078 --> 00:26:10,410  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:352 Y2:419
I want to protect my
friendship with both.

281
00:26:10,581 --> 00:26:13,049  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:380 Y2:419
Then you'll never get either one.

282
00:26:14,118 --> 00:26:17,713  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:384 Y2:419
Thanks. Think I'll stick with the book.

283
00:26:17,888 --> 00:26:21,380  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:354 Y2:419
Clark, love isn't about playing
it safe, it's about risks.

284
00:26:21,558 --> 00:26:24,459  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:352 Y2:419
Unless you put yourself
out there, you'll never know.

285
00:26:24,628 --> 00:26:29,122  X1:108 X2:610 Y1:352 Y2:419
- Have you ever been in love before?
- I've only loved two women in my life.

286
00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:33,292  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:352 Y2:419
- One died and the other betrayed me.
- I'm sorry.

287
00:26:34,204 --> 00:26:36,638  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:380 Y2:419
Some people are meant to be alone.

288
00:26:43,714 --> 00:26:48,742  X1:221 X2:497 Y1:352 Y2:419
- Mom, what is it?
- It's Principal Kwan.

289
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:51,615  X1:169 X2:550 Y1:384 Y2:419
He was killed in an accident.

290
00:26:58,795 --> 00:27:02,231  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:352 Y2:419
- Hey, guys. How are you holding up?
- I still can't believe this happened.

291
00:27:02,399 --> 00:27:05,800  X1:115 X2:604 Y1:352 Y2:419
Putting together a memorial issue but
when you're looking for pictures...

292
00:27:05,969 --> 00:27:09,962  X1:106 X2:613 Y1:352 Y2:419
...you never find them. Pete, can you
check the library files? One more time?

293
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,074  X1:272 X2:446 Y1:352 Y2:419
- Sure.
- Thank you.

294
00:27:12,242 --> 00:27:17,737  X1:107 X2:610 Y1:352 Y2:419
Got Kwan's police report. His car was
still on, it must have slipped into gear.

295
00:27:17,915 --> 00:27:21,646  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:354 Y2:419
- Chloe, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

296
00:27:22,186 --> 00:27:24,620  X1:129 X2:589 Y1:352 Y2:419
- I can't find anything in this office!
- Let me help.

297
00:27:24,788 --> 00:27:26,722  X1:255 X2:464 Y1:380 Y2:419
No, thank you.

298
00:27:30,494 --> 00:27:32,291  X1:227 X2:490 Y1:382 Y2:419
Chloe, look at this.

299
00:27:33,864 --> 00:27:37,960  X1:088 X2:630 Y1:352 Y2:419
The first three numbers of Kwan's license
plate match Justin's hit-and-run driver.

300
00:27:38,135 --> 00:27:39,727  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:356 Y2:419
- What are you getting at?
- Well...

301
00:27:39,903 --> 00:27:42,337  X1:141 X2:579 Y1:352 Y2:419
...there's a lot of weird accidents
around this guy.

302
00:27:42,506 --> 00:27:45,475  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:352 Y2:419
Clark, you are seriously barking
up the wrong tree here.

303
00:27:45,642 --> 00:27:47,576  X1:108 X2:612 Y1:380 Y2:419
Did you get a response from the DMV?

304
00:27:47,744 --> 00:27:49,871  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:352 Y2:419
- No, it never came through.
- Yes, you did.

305
00:27:50,047 --> 00:27:53,073  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:352 Y2:419
4:43 yesterday. Around
the time you were here with Justin.

306
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,582  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:352 Y2:419
- He couldn't have done it.
- Because you like him?

307
00:27:55,752 --> 00:27:59,188  X1:145 X2:574 Y1:352 Y2:419
No, because I know him and
I know he wouldn't hurt anyone.

308
00:28:05,128 --> 00:28:07,028  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:380 Y2:419
I hope you're right.

309
00:28:16,673 --> 00:28:22,543  X1:169 X2:551 Y1:352 Y2:419
"I celebrate myself and what
I assume you shall assume."

310
00:28:22,713 --> 00:28:27,776  X1:145 X2:575 Y1:352 Y2:419
"For every atom belonging to me
as good belongs to you."

311
00:28:29,753 --> 00:28:32,221  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:352 Y2:419
Sounds like a description
of family, doesn't it?

312
00:28:32,389 --> 00:28:35,881  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:352 Y2:419
Not ours. Since when
do you read poetry?

313
00:28:36,226 --> 00:28:40,128  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:380 Y2:419
We're selling Cadmus Labs, Lex.

314
00:28:40,631 --> 00:28:44,624  X1:123 X2:595 Y1:352 Y2:419
Our deal memo gives me 50 percent
ownership with veto rights.

315
00:28:44,801 --> 00:28:47,361  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:380 Y2:419
I don't recall you asking my opinion.

316
00:28:47,537 --> 00:28:49,596  X1:195 X2:524 Y1:352 Y2:419
We only bought Cadmus
to bankrupt Sir Harry.

317
00:28:49,773 --> 00:28:53,072  X1:093 X2:625 Y1:352 Y2:419
After we pumped and dumped the stock,
the company's worthless.

318
00:28:53,243 --> 00:28:55,074  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:380 Y2:419
It served its purpose.

319
00:28:55,379 --> 00:28:58,837  X1:169 X2:551 Y1:356 Y2:419
You didn't come all this way
to talk about Cadmus.

320
00:28:59,783 --> 00:29:03,275  X1:211 X2:509 Y1:356 Y2:419
I understand Pamela's
back in the States.

321
00:29:03,453 --> 00:29:06,547  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:352 Y2:419
- And that she paid you a visit.
- Did you come to disinherit me?

322
00:29:06,823 --> 00:29:09,587  X1:179 X2:540 Y1:356 Y2:419
- Is that what she told you?
- Is it true?

323
00:29:10,727 --> 00:29:14,959  X1:193 X2:525 Y1:352 Y2:419
Your mother was
an extraordinary woman.

324
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:21,169  X1:128 X2:592 Y1:352 Y2:419
But her taste in help left a lot to be
desired. Pamela was a hanger-on.

325
00:29:21,605 --> 00:29:24,472  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:354 Y2:419
She convinced your mother
to leave her all that stock, then...

326
00:29:24,641 --> 00:29:27,007  X1:192 X2:529 Y1:352 Y2:419
...she disappeared before
the body was even cold.

327
00:29:27,444 --> 00:29:30,072  X1:153 X2:567 Y1:356 Y2:419
You took time out of your busy
schedule to tell me that?

328
00:29:30,247 --> 00:29:35,344  X1:089 X2:629 Y1:352 Y2:419
I know how much she meant to you and I
don't want her using emotional tyranny...

329
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:37,953  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:352 Y2:419
...to hit you up for money.
- Why would she do that?

330
00:29:38,121 --> 00:29:39,418  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:380 Y2:419
She's got plenty of stock.

331
00:29:39,756 --> 00:29:42,850  X1:128 X2:592 Y1:352 Y2:419
Probably she doesn't want to sell it
to pay her medical bills.

332
00:29:43,026 --> 00:29:44,584  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:384 Y2:419
What medical bills?

333
00:29:45,829 --> 00:29:51,597  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:356 Y2:419
- She didn't tell you. How noble.
- Tell me what?

334
00:29:52,369 --> 00:29:56,430  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:380 Y2:419
She's dying, Lex. Cancer.

335
00:29:58,575 --> 00:30:02,443  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:352 Y2:419
Probably all those years sitting
in the sun in Saint-Tropez.

336
00:30:06,016 --> 00:30:09,508  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:352 Y2:419
- What does she want?
- Forgiveness.

337
00:30:11,021 --> 00:30:13,148  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:380 Y2:419
And what did you tell her?

338
00:30:14,358 --> 00:30:16,121  X1:276 X2:442 Y1:380 Y2:419
To get out.

339
00:30:18,328 --> 00:30:23,630  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:352 Y2:419
No. She doesn't know you
very well, does she?

340
00:30:46,823 --> 00:30:48,791  X1:172 X2:546 Y1:380 Y2:419
What are you doing in here?

341
00:30:48,959 --> 00:30:54,397  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:352 Y2:419
Danny, I'm really sorry about
what happened to your dad.

342
00:30:58,101 --> 00:31:01,867  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:352 Y2:419
I don't understand what happened.
He had the car keys with him.

343
00:31:02,038 --> 00:31:07,203  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:352 Y2:419
It's like something just smashed
the car right into him.

344
00:31:09,379 --> 00:31:12,280  X1:111 X2:609 Y1:380 Y2:419
Danny, did you know a Justin Gaines?

345
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,614  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:352 Y2:419
Do you know if he came
by here last night?

346
00:31:15,786 --> 00:31:17,617  X1:288 X2:432 Y1:380 Y2:419
No, why?

347
00:31:18,622 --> 00:31:23,150  X1:140 X2:580 Y1:352 Y2:419
I think Justin believes your father
was responsible for the accident.

348
00:31:23,326 --> 00:31:25,886  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:380 Y2:419
That's crazy. You should leave.

349
00:31:26,062 --> 00:31:30,192  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:352 Y2:419
He matched part of your dad's license
plate to the hit-and-run driver's.

350
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:42,876  X1:149 X2:571 Y1:380 Y2:419
Is there a chance Justin's right?

351
00:31:44,247 --> 00:31:46,545  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:380 Y2:419
My dad didn't deserve this.

352
00:31:49,886 --> 00:31:53,151  X1:193 X2:525 Y1:352 Y2:419
Your dad wasn't the one
driving the car, was he?

353
00:31:57,794 --> 00:31:59,819  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:384 Y2:419
You're the one who hit Justin.

354
00:32:00,197 --> 00:32:01,960  X1:287 X2:432 Y1:380 Y2:419
My dad...

355
00:32:05,101 --> 00:32:07,501  X1:131 X2:589 Y1:380 Y2:419
...he was just trying to protect me.

356
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,357  X1:303 X2:415 Y1:384 Y2:419
Chloe?

357
00:32:36,433 --> 00:32:39,960  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:352 Y2:419
- My mom said you were here.
- Oh, I wanted to surprise you.

358
00:32:40,136 --> 00:32:44,004  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:352 Y2:419
I didn't see you at school today.
Did you hear about Principal Kwan?

359
00:32:44,574 --> 00:32:47,668  X1:147 X2:572 Y1:356 Y2:419
- I did. That's really weird, right?
- Yeah.

360
00:32:47,844 --> 00:32:50,608  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:352 Y2:419
I guess you never know
when your time's up.

361
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:55,877  X1:115 X2:604 Y1:356 Y2:419
Which is why I think we should make
the most of the time that we have.

362
00:32:57,888 --> 00:33:01,722  X1:106 X2:612 Y1:352 Y2:419
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. I forgot, I just remembered...

363
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:05,660  X1:100 X2:619 Y1:384 Y2:419
...I told Clark I'd meet him at his house.

364
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:11,999  X1:108 X2:612 Y1:352 Y2:419
For someone that is out of the picture,
you sure spend a lot of time with him.

365
00:33:12,168 --> 00:33:16,696  X1:100 X2:619 Y1:352 Y2:419
Don't worry. Today I plan on telling him
exactly what's going on between us.

366
00:33:41,831 --> 00:33:45,062  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:352 Y2:419
You did the right thing, Clark.
Convincing Danny to turn himself in.

367
00:33:45,235 --> 00:33:49,501  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:352 Y2:419
- His father's dead. He's going to jail.
- Some secrets destroy families.

368
00:33:49,673 --> 00:33:52,733  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:352 Y2:419
Clark, Chloe's on the phone,
she sounds really freaked out.

369
00:33:54,511 --> 00:33:57,674  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:352 Y2:419
- Chloe, what's up?
- I've been calling all over the place.

370
00:33:57,847 --> 00:34:00,611  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:352 Y2:419
I really screwed up, Justin
is involved, you were right.

371
00:34:00,784 --> 00:34:03,617  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:352 Y2:419
- Well, calm down. Where are you?
- <i>In your barn. </i>

372
00:34:03,787 --> 00:34:06,312  X1:187 X2:533 Y1:352 Y2:419
I haven't been completely
honest with you, Clark.

373
00:34:06,489 --> 00:34:09,390  X1:185 X2:534 Y1:356 Y2:419
I know how Justin caused
those accidents.

374
00:34:11,695 --> 00:34:13,026  X1:260 X2:458 Y1:384 Y2:419
Chloe? Chloe!

375
00:34:20,437 --> 00:34:22,098  X1:300 X2:418 Y1:384 Y2:419
Justin?

376
00:34:41,791 --> 00:34:45,522  X1:113 X2:606 Y1:352 Y2:419
How could you betray me? How could
you betray what we had together?

377
00:35:09,819 --> 00:35:11,150  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:382 Y2:419
Oh, no!

378
00:35:14,958 --> 00:35:18,917  X1:163 X2:556 Y1:352 Y2:419
That's what I love about you,
Chloe. You're a fighter.

379
00:35:43,486 --> 00:35:48,185  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:356 Y2:419
I'm sorry. I didn't want it
to end like this.

380
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:03,634  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:352 Y2:419
- How did you do that?
- You killed the wrong man.

381
00:36:03,807 --> 00:36:06,139  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:352 Y2:419
- You're lying.
- His son just turned himself in.

382
00:36:06,576 --> 00:36:09,067  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:356 Y2:419
- He was the one who hit you.
- That is not true!

383
00:36:09,245 --> 00:36:13,079  X1:113 X2:605 Y1:352 Y2:419
You said you cared about Chloe. How
many people are you willing to kill?

384
00:36:13,249 --> 00:36:14,978  X1:252 X2:465 Y1:384 Y2:419
Just one more.

385
00:36:18,354 --> 00:36:21,289  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:352 Y2:419
You've really got to stick
those landings, Clark.

386
00:36:22,258 --> 00:36:24,351  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:382 Y2:419
You can't win, Justin.

387
00:36:35,371 --> 00:36:38,340  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:380 Y2:419
Chloe, are you okay?

388
00:37:14,677 --> 00:37:18,977  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:352 Y2:419
- You're the last person I expected.
- Why didn't you tell me?

389
00:37:19,149 --> 00:37:22,880  X1:105 X2:614 Y1:352 Y2:419
- It's not your concern.
- It's not my concern that you're dying?

390
00:37:24,888 --> 00:37:29,791  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:352 Y2:419
- I could help, I can get you treatment.
- I didn't come to you for help or pity...

391
00:37:29,959 --> 00:37:33,588  X1:197 X2:524 Y1:352 Y2:419
...I came because I have
nothing left to lose.

392
00:37:38,735 --> 00:37:44,037  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:352 Y2:419
The truth is, I'm ashamed that it took
metastasizing to give me the courage.

393
00:37:44,207 --> 00:37:48,769  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:352 Y2:419
I let that bastard frighten me
into submission for so long.

394
00:37:49,112 --> 00:37:55,540  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:352 Y2:419
I was too scared to even tell you
just once how much you mean to me.

395
00:37:57,921 --> 00:38:01,186  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:352 Y2:419
How much I wanted
to help you grow up.

396
00:38:01,424 --> 00:38:06,384  X1:098 X2:621 Y1:380 Y2:419
I wish you had. I might be a better man.

397
00:38:07,297 --> 00:38:12,530  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:352 Y2:419
The fact that you're here speaks
volumes about the man that you are.

398
00:38:16,606 --> 00:38:19,131  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:380 Y2:419
Your mother would be proud.

399
00:38:24,047 --> 00:38:28,507  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:356 Y2:419
- I really miss her.
- So do I.

400
00:38:54,611 --> 00:38:57,273  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:352 Y2:419
- I just spoke to Justin's parents.
- How's he doing?

401
00:38:57,447 --> 00:39:00,814  X1:102 X2:618 Y1:352 Y2:419
He's in the psychiatric ward. The police
don't know what to charge him with...

402
00:39:00,984 --> 00:39:03,077  X1:115 X2:605 Y1:380 Y2:419
...but at least he won't hurt anybody.

403
00:39:04,587 --> 00:39:10,822  X1:093 X2:626 Y1:352 Y2:419
So should we do the "I told you so" part
or is my perennial bad judgment implicit?

404
00:39:11,027 --> 00:39:13,086  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:380 Y2:419
Chloe, I wish I were wrong.

405
00:39:13,563 --> 00:39:17,829  X1:111 X2:608 Y1:352 Y2:419
What is it with me? I can spot Wall of
Weird material from a mile away...

406
00:39:18,001 --> 00:39:20,162  X1:186 X2:534 Y1:356 Y2:419
...but put it in front of me
and I'm oblivious.

407
00:39:20,436 --> 00:39:23,200  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:380 Y2:419
You're not oblivious, you're trusting.

408
00:39:23,706 --> 00:39:26,539  X1:133 X2:586 Y1:352 Y2:419
You're strong enough to take risks
