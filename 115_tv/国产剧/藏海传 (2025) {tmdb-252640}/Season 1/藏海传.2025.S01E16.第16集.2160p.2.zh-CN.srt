3
00:00:05,707 --> 00:00:08,335
这个值多少钱？
How much will you give me for it?

4
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:10,542
50块
Fifty bucks.

5
00:00:11,079 --> 00:00:12,410
是金子做的哎
It's made out of gold.

6
00:00:13,348 --> 00:00:15,714
- 谁告诉你的？ - 我老妈
-Who told you that? -My mother.

7
00:00:17,185 --> 00:00:19,415
告诉她这是假的
Tell her it's a fake.

8
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:22,887
没法告诉她了
I can't.

9
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:27,022
她死掉了
She's dead.

10
00:00:29,998 --> 00:00:32,023
那我给你60块吧
I'll give you sixty bucks.

11
00:00:59,427 --> 00:01:01,395
怎么样了？
So, what's the deal?

12
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:05,328
- 我告诉过你们我不想做这种事了 - 我们这是最后一次了
-I told you, I don't want to do this anymore. -Oh, this is our last job.

13
00:01:05,667 --> 00:01:07,464
骗人
Liar.

14
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,838
小孩！你现在只能靠我们
We're all you've got, kid.

15
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,973
告诉我他的密码
Tell me the combination.

16
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:20,842
45-13-29
25-13-29.

17
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:23,040
这才是好孩子
Good boy.

18
00:01:26,688 --> 00:01:30,522
好了，你们知道该怎么做吧？
Okay, you know the drill, right?

19
00:01:31,826 --> 00:01:35,922
- 我们开始吧 - 拿上包，我们开始了
-Let's do this. -Get the bag. Let's go.

20
00:01:36,664 --> 00:01:38,894
不要忘记我的天使
Don't forget my angel.

21
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:08,826
怎么了？ 你们是什么人？
What's going on here? Hey, who are you people?

22
00:02:08,997 --> 00:02:11,329
噢,我的天啊，不要！不要！
Oh, my God, no! No!

23
00:02:13,835 --> 00:02:16,030
天哪！他死掉了！
Oh, my God, I think he's dead.

24
00:02:16,571 --> 00:02:18,971
- 快走！ - 你为什么要这样做?
-Let's go! -No. What did you do that for?

25
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,075
不是他死就是我们亡，宝贝，我们快走！
It was him or us, baby. We gotta go!

26
00:02:22,243 --> 00:02:23,870
快点
Come on.

27
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,778
他要去那里？追啊
Where's he going? Go.

28
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,447
赖恩！
Ryan!

29
00:02:52,273 --> 00:02:54,571
我的天哪
Oh, my God.

30
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:59,611
你还好吧？
Are you all right?

31
00:03:03,418 --> 00:03:06,319
- 你还好吗？ - 我鞋子掉了
-Are you all right? -I lost my shoe.

32
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:09,888
我要带你去医院！快，起来
I'm taking you to the hospital. Come on.

我一直留着整个世界只为你闪耀

49
00:04:11,612 --> 00:04:14,612
超人始创作者:杰瑞・希杰尔和乔・夏斯特

52
00:04:16,412 --> 00:04:19,002
电视策划:阿尔弗雷德・哥夫，麦尔斯・米莱

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,803
第十六集:孤儿

54
00:04:21,963 --> 00:04:24,295
他的身体没有大碍 只是一些淤青和划伤
He checks out physically, just scrapes and bruises.

55
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:26,558
和他的父母联系过了吗？
Have you managed to contact his parents yet?

56
00:04:26,901 --> 00:04:30,200
除了名字以外 赖恩说他什么都不记得了
Other than knowing his name, Ryan claims to have no memory.

57
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,900
特别客串主演:约翰・格鲁夫

58
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:31,929
Are you saying he has amnesia?

59
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:35,439
True amnesia is extremely rare. It's most likely post-traumatic shock.

60
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
客串主演:赖安・科利
His memory will probably return within 24 to 48 hours.

61
00:04:40,081 --> 00:04:42,242
What if it doesn't?

62
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:43,780
Martha, Jonathan.

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
吉姆・希尔德

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
布兰迪・雷德佛
It's unlikely all Ryan's cuts and bruises were caused by the accident.

65
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:58,088
-You think he's been abused? -He may not want to remember.

66
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,900
联合执行制片:格列哥・比曼

67
00:04:58,533 --> 00:04:59,795
What will happen to him?

68
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,200
监督制片:马克・伏黑顿
We've called Child Services, but they're understaffed...

69
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:04,664
...and can't come until tomorrow at the earliest.

70
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:08,741
So the only place for Ryan to stay is at the juvenile cell at the sheriff's station.

71
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,277
-That's no place for a child. -Why can't he come home with us?

72
00:05:12,647 --> 00:05:14,740
-That's a great idea. -Can we do that?

73
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,800
制片人:迈克尔・格林
I'll have to make some calls, but I don't see why not.

74
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:21,416
It'd be a big help to us, and I'm sure Ryan would appreciate it.

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
制片人:道里斯・伊根
-Clark? -It's me, Mrs. Kent.

76
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:37,036
-Ryan, did you do all this? -I hope you don't mind. I couldn't sleep.

77
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,300
联合制片:格雷格・沃克

78
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:43,133
-Hey, what's the occasion? -I wanted to make myself useful.

79
00:05:43,678 --> 00:05:46,442
-Thanks for letting me stay here. -Stay as long as you want.

80
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,200
制片人:鲍勃・哈格罗夫
Maybe some of you will rub off on Clark.

81
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:52,618
What does everybody want? Let me guess...

82
00:05:52,787 --> 00:05:54,379
...pancakes...

83
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,951
...with powdered sugar...

84
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:02,493
...not syrup.

85
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:06,723
-How did you know that? -I saw you eyeing them when you came in.

86
00:06:07,335 --> 00:06:09,098
Scrambled eggs...

87
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:10,961
...bacon...

88
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
联合执行制片:肯・霍顿
...coffee with milk and a little bit of honey.

89
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
编剧:菲利普・莱温斯
Well, that is some trick there, kiddo.

90
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
导演:保罗・沙尔皮罗

91
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:31,929
你是说他失忆了？

92
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:35,439
真正的失忆是很少见的 更像是受刺激导致的创伤后应激障碍

93
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:39,911
他的记忆大概在24到48小时之内就会恢复

94
00:04:40,081 --> 00:04:42,242
如果没有呢？

95
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:43,780
玛莎，强纳森

96
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:53,426
莱恩身上淤青和伤口 不完全是车祸造成的

97
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:58,088
- 你觉得他受过虐待？ - 他可能不愿意想起来

98
00:04:58,533 --> 00:04:59,795
那打算以后怎么安排他这事？

99
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:02,333
我们给儿童中心打过电话了， 但是他们的人手不够...

100
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:04,664
...最早明早才能到

101
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:08,741
所以今晚赖恩只能去少管所了

102
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,277
- 那不是小孩子该呆的地方 - 我们为什么不能把他带回家呢？

103
00:05:12,647 --> 00:05:14,740
- 这是个好主意 - 我们可以带他回去么？

104
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:17,840
我需要打几个电话确认下 不过应该没什么问题的

105
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:21,416
真是帮了我们大忙 我相信赖恩会很感激的

106
00:05:30,565 --> 00:05:32,499
- 克拉克？ - 是我，肯特夫人

107
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:37,036
- 这些都是你做的吗？ - 希望你不会介意，我睡不着

108
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:43,133
- 这是要庆祝什么？ - 我希望自己能派上用场

109
00:05:43,678 --> 00:05:46,442
- 谢谢你们让我待在这 - 你想待多久就多久

110
00:05:46,614 --> 00:05:49,344
说不定能给克拉克带来好影响

111
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:52,618
大家都想吃什么？让我来猜下…

112
00:05:52,787 --> 00:05:54,379
煎饼

113
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,951
加糖末

114
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:02,493
…但不加糖浆…

115
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:06,723
- 你是怎么知道的？ - 你一进来的时候就盯着它们

116
00:06:07,335 --> 00:06:09,098
炒蛋…

117
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:10,961
…熏肉…

118
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:14,539
…咖啡加牛奶和一点点的蜂蜜

119
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:18,538
- 噢，真是奇妙的把戏，孩纸

120
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:20,004
- 嗨，妈 - 嗨
-Hey, Mom. -Hi.

121
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:22,012
给新小孩做了大餐啊
Going all out for the new kid, huh?

122
00:06:22,183 --> 00:06:24,913
其实啊，克拉克 都是赖恩自己做的
Actually, Clark, Ryan took care of all this himself.

123
00:06:25,086 --> 00:06:26,678
让我情何以堪啊
You're making me look bad.

124
00:06:26,921 --> 00:06:29,185
你早餐想吃点什么？
What do you want for breakfast?

125
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:36,424
- 克拉克，你什么都不想吃么？ - 我要煎饼就好了
-Don't you want anything, Clark? -I'm just gonna have some pancakes.

126
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:40,397
赖恩，你没事吧？
Ryan, you okay?

127
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:45,802
赖恩，你真的不记得昨晚的事了吗？
Ryan, are you sure you don't remember anything about last night?

128
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:48,100
其实，我还是没搞明白...
You see, because I still can't figure out...

129
00:06:48,276 --> 00:06:51,439
…为什么晚上10点，你会在90号高速上
...why you were out on Route 90 at 10:00 at night.

130
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:53,239
我说过我不记得了
I said I don't remember.

131
00:06:58,386 --> 00:07:00,752
我什么都没隐瞒
I'm not hiding anything.

132
00:07:03,124 --> 00:07:05,285
没人说你隐瞒了，孩子
No one said you were, buddy.

133
00:07:07,285 --> 00:07:12,285

134
00:07:18,506 --> 00:07:21,134
我猜你父母现在想让我离开了
Guess your parents want me to leave now.

135
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:24,408
- 你为什么这么想？ - 因为他们不相信我
-Why would you think that? -Because they don't believe me.

136
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:29,913
- 我们只是想帮你回家 - 如果我没有家呢？
-We just want to help you get home. -What if I don't have a home?

137
00:07:31,252 --> 00:07:33,880
如果你们知道我做过坏事，会怎样呢？
What if you found out I did bad things? What would happen?

138
00:07:34,055 --> 00:07:37,388
相信我，赖恩，一切都会好起来的
Ryan, everything's gonna work out. I know it.

139
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:41,319
你喜欢看漫画？
You like comics?

140
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:44,392
我很喜欢这一套
I like this one.

141
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:46,157
《战斗天使》，为什么喜欢他？
<i>Warrior Angel. Why him?</i>

142
00:07:46,734 --> 00:07:49,828
因为他保护那些保护不了自己的人
Because he protects people who can't protect themselves.

143
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:56,937
克拉克，我喜欢待在你身边
I like being around you, Clark.

144
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:00,739
觉得很安心
It's peaceful.

145
00:08:03,351 --> 00:08:06,411
为什么不放下漫画书，来打会儿球呢？
Why don't you get your head out of that comic and play a little ball?

146
00:08:24,739 --> 00:08:29,039
- 你一定觉得我很差劲 - 没关系，多练练就好了
-I know what you're thinking. I really suck. -Nothing a little practice can't cure.

147
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:32,373
来吧，抬起你的手臂，手肘保持竖直
Go ahead. Get your hand up, keep your elbows straight...

148
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:35,982
让球顺着你的手指导出去
...just guide the ball with your fingers.

149
00:08:38,052 --> 00:08:39,679
- 哇！你投中加分了！ - 是啊！
-He shoots, and he scores! -Yeah.

150
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:41,185
太棒了！
Nice.

151
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,218
打扰一下
Excuse me.

152
00:08:48,496 --> 00:08:51,556
- 怎么？ - 我在找告示上的那个男孩
-Yes. -I'm looking for the boy from the paper.

153
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:53,859
就是那个失忆的那个
You know, the one who lost his memory.

154
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,195
- 你是？ - 私家侦探
-And you are? -A private detective.

155
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,203
我帮一对夫妇在找他们走失的儿子
I work for a couple who lost their son.

156
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,207
赖恩还在这里吗？
Is Ryan still around?

157
00:09:02,076 --> 00:09:03,202
没有…
No...

158
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:07,643
…麻烦你等一下 我帮你叫一下哈登医生，她会跟你详谈
...but if you just wait, I'll get Dr. Harden. I know she'd like to speak with you.

159
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,918
真棒！
All right.

160
00:09:25,433 --> 00:09:28,095
很和谐，是吧？
That's a great sound, isn't it?

161
00:09:28,469 --> 00:09:31,438
是啊
Yeah, it is.

162
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:41,181
你有没有想再领养一个孩子？
Do you ever think we made the wrong decision, not adopting another child?

163
00:09:41,482 --> 00:09:44,815
或许有个可以分享秘密的弟弟 会让他感觉更舒服
Maybe sharing his secret with a younger brother would have helped.

164
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:47,476
他看上去确实很喜欢赖恩
He seems to really like Ryan.

165
00:09:47,655 --> 00:09:50,180
大家都很喜欢赖恩啊
I don't think he's the only one.

166
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:55,920
- 你对无家可归的小孩总是没有抵抗力 - 事实证明我们收养克拉克是明智的
-You've always had a soft spot for strays. -Well, the last one turned out all right.

167
00:09:56,564 --> 00:09:58,828
来吧，再来一次
Here you go. One more.

168
00:10:00,835 --> 00:10:02,632
哇！太棒了！
Oh, nice.

169
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,632
我以为你还在摩纳哥呢
I thought you were still in Monaco.

170
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:13,075
"惊喜的精髓就在于速度和保密"
"The backbone of surprise is fusing speed with secrecy."

171
00:10:13,247 --> 00:10:15,977
出自卡尔・冯・克劳塞维茨的《战争论》
<i>Von Clausevitz, On War.</i>

172
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,311
爸爸，即使是对于你来说，这本书也太古老了吧
Isn't that a little '80s, Dad, even for you?

173
00:10:18,486 --> 00:10:22,752
我去检查工厂从来不通知经理
I never give my plant managers a heads-up before a spot inspection.

174
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:25,619
我真不知道你现在还有什么不满意的？
What could you possibly have to complain about now?

175
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:28,626
工厂的生意不错，股价也在持续上涨…
The plant's doing well, LuthorCorp stock is up....

176
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:30,923
莱克斯，我没有什么不满意的
I'm not here to complain, Lex.

177
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:34,295
相反，我觉得你最近的表现…
On the contrary. Your performance lately has been...

178
00:10:37,738 --> 00:10:39,330
…让我相当满意
...more than adequate.

179
00:10:40,574 --> 00:10:43,304
这赞赏听上去还别有深意吧
That sounds dangerously like a compliment.

180
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:47,336
莱克斯，我不否认 我拿更大的期望在督促你
I push you, Lex, I don't deny it.

181
00:10:47,515 --> 00:10:51,474
伟大是一种稀薄的空气 我必须教你如何去呼吸
Greatness is a rarefied air one has to be taught to breathe.

182
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:57,852
马其顿将儿子在狮群中喂养 就是为了教会他勇敢无畏
Philip of Macedonia raised his son among lions to instill fearlessness in him.

183
00:10:58,025 --> 00:11:01,256
他也试过用长矛刺穿儿子吗？
Didn't he also try to impale the kid with a spear?

184
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:03,692
在一次失败的政变中他试过
In an aborted coup attempt...

185
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:07,630
但重要的是那个男孩青史留名 他就是亚历山大大帝
...but history remembers that boy as Alexander the Great.

186
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:11,065
你来这不是为了教我希腊历史吧
You didn't come all this way to lecture me on Greek history.

187
00:11:11,205 --> 00:11:16,074
不，我想叫你回大都会
No. I want you to come back to Metropolis...

188
00:11:16,744 --> 00:11:21,875
我让你担任"名誉主席特别顾问"的职位
...where you will hold the position "special advisor to the chairman emeritus."

189
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:24,517
也就是我的顾问
That would be me.

190
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:28,519
- 至少这个头衔听上去很有份量 - 它不仅仅是个头衔，更是一次机会
-At least the title sounds important. -It's more than a title. It's an opportunity.

191
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:32,056
也正是你来斯摩维尔所苦苦等待的机会
It's what you've been waiting for ever since you came to Smallville.

192
00:11:32,226 --> 00:11:33,853
我会考虑一下的
I'll think about it.

193
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:39,427
你现在吊我胃口 弄得像是你帮我的忙一样
You want to keep me dangling, so it looks like you're granting me a favor...

194
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,194
而并不是我帮你的忙
...instead of receiving one?

195
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,867
儿子，你没必要和我耍心机
We don't need to play games, son.

196
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:52,672
爸爸，我们除了耍心机还剩什么
Dad, games are all we've got.

197
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:59,919
- 哇，你真是现代的卡斯帕・豪瑟啊 - 他是谁？
-Wow, you're a modern-day Kaspar Hauser. -Who's that?

198
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:03,079
别管了，克罗伊总是很擅长 说一些我们听不懂的东西
Don't worry. Chloe's the queen of obscure and irrelevant references.

199
00:12:03,357 --> 00:12:05,848
他是19世纪一个失忆的男孩
He's a kid from the 19th century with amnesia.

200
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:08,927
他出现一个德国小镇，不记得自己是谁
He showed up in a German town without a memory of who he was...

201
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:11,360
只记得自己的名字
...all he could remember was his name.

202
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:14,634
- 后来怎么样了？ - 他的故事被传播到整个欧洲
-What happened to him? -Well, his story spread throughout Europe...

203
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:17,862
各地的人都赶来看他是不是自己走失的孩子
...and people from all over came to see if he was their missing child.

204
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:20,836
有些人认为他是大公爵的那个走失的孩子
Some people thought he was the lost son of the grand duke.

205
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:25,202
- 后来他找到父母了吗？ - 是这样的…
-Did he ever find his parents? -You know....

206
00:12:29,283 --> 00:12:30,773
是的，找到了
Yeah, he did.

207
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:37,282
他找到了父母 从此一家人幸福地生活在一起
He found his parents, and they lived happily ever after.

208
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:42,395
你为什么不直接说他被谋杀了？
Why didn't you just say he was murdered?

209
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:44,954
你怎么会知道呢？
How did you know that?

210
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:50,969
好吧，我们为什么不照张相呢
You know, why don't we take that picture?

211
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:53,265
照什么相啊？
What picture?

212
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:56,334
你不是要把我放在那个变态墙上展示吧？
You're not putting me on that freak wall, are you?

213
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,307
那个墙叫“怪异之墙”，而且我并不是要放你上去
It's called the Wall of Weird, and no...

214
00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:01,915
这张照片只是为了核对失踪的人
...this picture is just to check against missing persons.

215
00:13:03,317 --> 00:13:07,151
好了，我去把照片冲印出来，一会儿就好
Okay, I'm gonna go download this. I'll be there in a sec.

216
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,457
- 她喜欢你 - 当然，我们是朋友
-She likes you. -Yeah, we're friends.

217
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:16,360
她不仅仅想和你做朋友
She wants to be more than just friends.

218
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:20,057
- 她希望你能邀请她去舞会 - 克罗伊吗？
-She wants you to ask her to the prom. -Chloe?

219
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:24,861
- 好吧，你是对的 - 肯定是的
-Yeah, right. -No, really.

220
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:28,133
她已经挑好了裙子，是粉色的
She already picked out a dress. It's pink.

221
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:32,369
赖恩，你才刚认识克罗伊 而且她讨厌穿裙子
Ryan, you just met Chloe, and she hates dresses...

222
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:34,446
并且她也不是那种喜欢去舞会的人
...and she's not exactly the prom type.

223
00:13:34,615 --> 00:13:36,776
也许她有你不知道的浪漫一面呢
Maybe she has a romantic side you never knew about.

224
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:40,477
或者也许我妈妈把你的脑子撞坏了
Or maybe my mom hit you harder than I thought.

225
00:13:41,355 --> 00:13:43,949
让我再给你们两个拍一张
Let's get a picture of my boys.

226
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:52,054
你觉得有个小弟弟感觉怎么样？
So how does it feel having a little-brother-type figure in your life?

227
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:55,292
- 感觉不错 - 我一直希望能有一个兄弟姐妹
-It's pretty cool. -I dreamed of having a brother or sister...

228
00:13:55,469 --> 00:13:57,630
能在无聊的时候一起聊聊天
...someone to talk to, help fill the silence.

229
00:13:57,805 --> 00:14:00,774
能一直陪在你身边 让你可以绝对信任的人？
Someone you can totally trust and would always be there for you.

230
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:03,842
克拉克，你在我心中就是这样的
That's just how I see you, Clark.

231
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:06,572
谢谢
Thanks.

232
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:17,155
《战斗天使》，我很喜欢它
<i>Warrior Angel. I'm a fan myself.</i>

233
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:20,788
- 你一定是赖恩吧，我是… - 莱克斯・卢瑟
-You must be Ryan. I'm-- -Lex Luthor.

234
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:23,356
克拉克早和我谈过你了
Clark told me all about you.

235
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:27,125
- 我家里有一本… - 装框的珍藏首版
-You know, I have one of the-- -First-edition panels framed in your house.

236
00:14:27,301 --> 00:14:30,828
- 你怎么会知道？ - 你是富豪啊，猜到了
-How did you know that? -You're rich.

237
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:33,302
富豪们总是喜欢收藏
That's what rich people do, collect stuff.

238
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:36,008
我看你见过赖恩了
I see you've met Ryan.

239
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:38,576
明显我们都是《战斗天使》的死忠粉丝
<i>Apparently, we're both big Warrior Angel fans.</i>

240
00:14:39,413 --> 00:14:41,347
我都不知道你喜欢漫画书
I didn't know you liked comic books.

241
00:14:41,515 --> 00:14:45,076
从另一个星球来的访客想保护弱小？
A strange visitor from another planet who protects the weak?

242
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:48,354
我小的时候，他是我的偶像 更别提他也是个秃头了
When I was young, he was my idol, not to mention he's bald.

243
00:14:48,522 --> 00:14:51,013
我有全套收藏
I have the whole collection.

244
00:14:51,492 --> 00:14:53,983
- 我们可以晚点过去看看 - 好的
-Maybe we'll come by later and check it out. -Yeah.

245
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:57,790
- 你觉得怎么样，老弟？ - 随便
-Would you like that, buddy? -Whatever.

246
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:00,166
随便
Whatever.

247
00:15:02,636 --> 00:15:04,433
这样有点粗鲁
That was kind of rude.

248
00:15:04,605 --> 00:15:08,905
- 莱克斯是我的朋友 - 别担心他，他快离开小镇了
-Lex is my friend. -Don't worry about him. He's going to leave.

249
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:11,237
莱克斯的爸爸给他找了个新工作
Lex's father offered him a new job.

250
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:15,245
你不了解莱克斯的爸爸 他绝不会这么做
You don't know Lex's father. He would never do that.

251
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,945
你必须停止编造别人的故事
You have to stop making up stories about people.

252
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,454
过会见
I'll see you in a minute.

253
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:16,242
赖恩？
Ryan?

254
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:20,970
赖恩刚从后门逃走了 他看起来很害怕，克拉克
Ryan just took off out the back. He looked scared, Clark.

255
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:36,657
赖恩？ 
Ryan?

256
00:17:15,302 --> 00:17:17,497
救命
Help!

257
00:17:17,738 --> 00:17:19,330
救命
Help!

258
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,803
救命
Help!

259
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:40,824
你现在安全了
You're safe now.

260
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:52,701
克拉克，你的小跟班呢
Clark, where's your young sidekick?

261
00:17:52,873 --> 00:17:54,500
睡觉呢
Sleeping.

262
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:57,339
他觉得你是他的大哥哥
He thinks you're his big brother.

263
00:17:57,511 --> 00:18:02,107
恩，我猜也是，但到明天为止
Yeah, well, I guess I am, till tomorrow.

264
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:06,081
- 你越来越喜欢那孩子了 - 你知道的
-The kid is growing on you. -You know how it is.

265
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:08,813
作为独生子，没人在身边
Being an only child, no one else around.

266
00:18:08,989 --> 00:18:11,480
你难道从没想过有个兄弟姐妹吗
Don't you ever wish you had a sibling?

267
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,555
我曾经有过一个，克拉克
I had one, Clark.

268
00:18:13,727 --> 00:18:15,319
真的吗？我都不知道
Really? I didn't know.

269
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:20,794
当我11岁的时候，我妈又怀孕了
When I was 11, my mother got pregnant again.

270
00:18:20,968 --> 00:18:25,234
这是个奇迹，我从没见我父亲能比这更开心
It was a total surprise. I've never seen my father happier.

271
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:27,473
朱利安出生的那天是唯一的一次...
The day Julian was born was the only time...

272
00:18:27,641 --> 00:18:30,132
...我感觉我的家庭有人情味
...I felt like I was part of a real family.

273
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,301
然后怎么了
And what happened?

274
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:36,342
他洗礼的那个早晨，我妈去育婴室...
The morning of his baptism, my mother went to his nursery...

275
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:40,111
...发现他在婴儿床上，已经断气了
...found him in his crib, he had stopped breathing.

276
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:46,085
在那以后，我母亲变了个性情 我父亲也变得更冷漠
My mother was never the same after that, and my father got even more distant.

277
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:50,857
他把朱利安看作是第二次机会
I think he saw Julian as his second chance.

278
00:18:51,031 --> 00:18:54,558
一次他能好好爱儿子的机会
A chance for him to have a son he could truly love.

279
00:18:55,836 --> 00:18:57,201
对不起
I'm sorry.

280
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:01,902
都已经过去了，克拉克
It's in the past, Clark.

281
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:05,206
不管怎样，我跟他最后都会讨厌对方
We would have ended up hating each other, anyway.

282
00:19:05,379 --> 00:19:08,280
我父亲肯定会想法设法做到跟我互相仇恨的
My father would have seen to that.

283
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:14,509
但我来这里不是为了说我家的悲剧的
But I didn't come over to recount my family's tragic history.

284
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:18,086
我父亲给我一个重回大都会的机会
My father has offered me a chance to return to Metropolis.

285
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:22,627
你告诉过赖恩吗?
Did you tell Ryan about that?

286
00:19:25,766 --> 00:19:28,792
我还没告诉任何人，克拉克
I haven't told anyone, Clark.

287
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:32,161
这不正是你一直想要的
Well, that's what you always wanted.

288
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:34,102
我曾经是这么想
I used to think it was.

289
00:19:34,408 --> 00:19:37,036
但现在不确定了
Now I'm not so sure.

290
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:40,310
我在那就是另一个人了
I was a different person there.

291
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,677
我父亲身边不同的人
A different person around my father.

292
00:19:44,084 --> 00:19:48,680
他明晚就要答案，我们会去大都会晚餐
He wants an answer tomorrow night. We're having dinner in Metropolis.

293
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:54,387
如果有人可以 选择成为什么样的人，莱克斯...
If anyone can choose who they want to be, Lex...

294
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:56,222
...那必定是你
...it's you.

295
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:07,598
- 敲门了 - 肯特先生，真意外
-Knock, knock. -Mr. Kent, this is a surprise.

296
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:11,574
赖恩跟我干了一整天的活，他应该休息下
Yeah, Ryan's been doing chores with me all day, so I figured he deserved a break.

297
00:20:11,745 --> 00:20:14,305
我想要一杯咖啡，给他点他想要的...
I'd like a cup of coffee, give him whatever he wants...

298
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:17,814
...告诉我电话在哪，我去问问玛莎要什么
...and if you can point me to a phone, I'll see if Martha wants anything.

299
00:20:18,185 --> 00:20:21,643
- 好的，在后面 - 好的，玩得开心点
-All right, it's in the back. -All right. Enjoy.

300
00:20:22,189 --> 00:20:24,919
- 今天感觉怎么样? - 好多了，谢谢
-So how you feeling today? -Much better, thanks.

301
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:26,882
很好
Good.

302
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,855
你觉得朋友间有秘密好不好
Do you think it's okay if friends have secrets?

303
00:20:31,031 --> 00:20:33,966
奇怪的问题，你怎么这么问？
Strange question. Why do you ask?

304
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:37,326
因为我觉得克拉克向我隐瞒了一些事
Because I think Clark is hiding something from me.

305
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:39,529
每个人都有秘密，赖恩
Everybody has secrets, Ryan.

306
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:41,936
真的吗？你的呢
Really? What's yours?

307
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:46,940
如果我告诉你，它就不是秘密了
If I told you, then it wouldn't be a secret.

308
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,273
你是对的
I guess you're right.

309
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:58,189
- 谢谢，斯凯，你来得真及时 - 不用谢
-Thanks, Skye, you're a lifesaver. -You're welcome.

310
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:07,597
- 为什么皱眉 - 她不是个好人，拉娜
-Why the frown? -She's not a good person, Lana.

311
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:09,796
你应该解雇他
You should fire her.

312
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,871
赖恩，为什么这么说
Ryan, why would you say something like that?

313
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,473
因为这是事实
Because it's the truth.

314
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:17,542
你从何得知
How do you know?

315
00:21:19,246 --> 00:21:21,271
这是个秘密
It's a secret.

316
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:43,258
谢谢你的热巧克力，肯特先生
Thanks for the hot chocolate, Mr. Kent.

317
00:21:46,006 --> 00:21:49,669
看看赖恩，他自己找到了一个新家庭
Looks like Ryan has found himself a new family.

318
00:21:55,282 --> 00:21:59,241
- 该回去工作了 - 什么时候去抓那个孩子
-It's time to get back to work. -When do we get the kid?

319
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:03,054
一切准备就绪的时候
When we're ready.

320
00:22:04,191 --> 00:22:07,422
我母亲在这附近撞到了他
My mom hit him somewhere around here.

321
00:22:07,594 --> 00:22:09,494
谢谢你帮我搜索线索
Thanks for helping with the clue hunt.

322
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:12,063
顺便解开赖恩的谜团，我很荣幸
And help solve the riddle of Ryan? It's my pleasure.

323
00:22:12,232 --> 00:22:14,564
这的确是个谜
There really is a riddle.

324
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:17,133
我开始怀疑他并没有失忆
I'm starting to think he may not have amnesia.

325
00:22:17,304 --> 00:22:19,864
克拉克，那孩子很崇拜你，他为什么要撒谎
Clark, the kid adores you, why would he lie?

326
00:22:20,207 --> 00:22:22,767
因为他在逃避某些人
Because he's running from somebody.

327
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,407
我发现一个包
I found something.

328
00:22:34,221 --> 00:22:36,883
里面有漫画书
We got comic books...

329
00:22:37,057 --> 00:22:38,718
...糖果
...and Twizzlers.

330
00:22:38,892 --> 00:22:42,020
一些成长中的男孩必备品
Something every growing boy needs.

331
00:22:50,136 --> 00:22:52,764
怎么了？我平时藏东西也藏这
What? It's where I would hide something.

332
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,103
如果你是个CIA特工
If you were a CIA operative.

333
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:00,503
你觉得她会是谁
Who do you think it is?

334
00:23:00,981 --> 00:23:03,609
我不知道....妈妈？阿姨
I don't know.... Mom, aunt?

335
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:05,876
谜团变深了
And the mystery deepens.

336
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:09,249
我始终不明白他怎么知道卡斯帕豪瑟被谋杀了
I still can't figure out how he knew that Kaspar Hauser was murdered.

337
00:23:09,422 --> 00:23:12,755
你说谎时脸色那么不自然啊
Well, you weren't exactly wearing a poker face.

338
00:23:12,926 --> 00:23:15,520
赖恩说了一些奇怪的事情
Ryan does say weird things.

339
00:23:15,695 --> 00:23:20,155
他甚至说你想让我请你去参加舞会 而且你还买了条裙子
He even said that you wanted me to ask you to prom and that you'd bought a dress.

340
00:23:22,102 --> 00:23:23,694
不是粉色的吧？
It's not pink, is it?

341
00:23:28,008 --> 00:23:33,139
这个，你知道，我只是看看 没想真买
Okay, you know, I was just looking at it, it's not like I actually bought it.

342
00:23:33,313 --> 00:23:35,873
赖恩怎么知道的？
How would Ryan know that?

343
00:23:38,818 --> 00:23:43,551
我不知道，也许他是个外星人 或者他问了灵媒，总之我也说不清
I don't know. Maybe he's an alien, or maybe he called Miss Cleo. You know, I don't know.

344
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:51,425
克拉克是你生命中最好的礼物，对吗？
Clark's the best thing that ever happened to you.

345
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:53,031
你说的对
Yeah, he is.

346
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,128
他弥补了你不能生育的遗憾
He makes up for not being able to have your own kids.

347
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:01,062
是的
He does.

348
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:05,138
- 他一直都这么强壮吗？ - 什么意思？
-Has he always been so strong? -What do you mean?

349
00:24:05,512 --> 00:24:09,278
他撕开垃圾车的后板救了我
The way he tore off the back panel of the garbage truck and saved me.

350
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:11,815
傻瓜，他不可能做到的
Don't be silly, he couldn't do that.

351
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:19,254
如果你这么说的话…
If you say so.

352
00:24:22,662 --> 00:24:25,130
你最害怕什么？
What's your greatest fear?

353
00:24:25,732 --> 00:24:28,929
在你离开前做不完这个派
That I won't get this pie done by the time you have to leave.

354
00:24:31,438 --> 00:24:34,896
为什么不出去投几个篮玩玩呢？
Why don't you go outside and shoot some hoops?

355
00:25:14,481 --> 00:25:17,973
- 你在这里干什么？ - 克拉克，别生气
-What are you doing down here? -Clark, don't be mad.

356
00:25:18,318 --> 00:25:19,876
你怎么知道这里的？
How'd you know about this?

357
00:25:21,287 --> 00:25:23,255
从你妈妈的思想里读出来的
I heard about it in your mom's mind.

358
00:25:27,794 --> 00:25:30,763
我想亲眼看一看
I wanted to see it for myself.

359
00:25:33,266 --> 00:25:36,133
你可以读出每个人的想法吗？
Can you hear everything people think?

360
00:25:36,536 --> 00:25:39,130
仅限表面的想法
Only what's on the surface.

361
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:42,205
他们当时当刻的想法
What they're thinking at that moment.

362
00:25:42,509 --> 00:25:44,636
除了你
Except for you.

363
00:25:45,011 --> 00:25:48,970
我读不出你的 所以我认为你很特别
I can't read your mind. That's how I knew you were different.

364
00:25:49,482 --> 00:25:51,916
现在我知道为什么了
Now I know why.

365
00:25:52,585 --> 00:25:55,418
我无法相信你竟然这么做
I can't believe you'd do this.

366
00:25:55,755 --> 00:25:59,521
我不会告诉别人的 你为我保守秘密，我就保守你的
I'll never tell. You keep my secret, I'll keep yours.

367
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,124
- 没那么简单 - 就这么简单
-It's not that simple. -Sure it is.

368
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:06,194
我知道你爸爸担心别人会发现
I know your dad's worried that people are going to find out.

369
00:26:06,366 --> 00:26:09,460
我可以告诉他有人快要发现了
I can tell him when someone's getting close.

370
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:12,033
我告诉你克洛伊的秘密 也可以说出拉娜的
I told you about Chloe. I can tell you about Lana.

371
00:26:12,205 --> 00:26:14,639
- 你想知道她的秘密吗？ - 不想
-You want to know her secret? -No.

372
00:26:14,808 --> 00:26:16,207
赖恩，我一点都不想
No, Ryan, I don't.

373
00:26:17,277 --> 00:26:18,676
为什么不呢？
Why not?

374
00:26:18,845 --> 00:26:20,938
是关于你的
It's about you.

375
00:26:21,114 --> 00:26:22,809
你不能这么做
Look, you can't do this.

376
00:26:23,483 --> 00:26:26,543
你不理解和别人不同是什么感觉
You don't understand what it's like to be different.

377
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:31,656
必须隐藏起来 别人才不会认为你是个怪胎
What it's like to have to hide so people won't think you're a freak.

378
00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:35,019
不管我去哪…
Everywhere I go...

379
00:26:35,195 --> 00:26:37,993
都可以读出别人的想法
...I hear people's thoughts.

380
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:40,462
我再也不能封闭它
I can't block it out anymore.

381
00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:48,937
这是你妈妈？
Is this your mother?

382
00:26:53,246 --> 00:26:54,873
她死了
She died.

383
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:58,073
你为什么不告诉我？
Why didn't you tell me?

384
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:01,017
我希望能在你们家重新开始
I was hoping I could start over with your family.

385
00:27:01,988 --> 00:27:06,857
他们那么善良 我希望他们能像收养你一样收养我
They were so nice. I wanted them to adopt me like they did you.

386
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:09,690
那我就能安全了
So I'd be safe.

387
00:27:10,763 --> 00:27:15,325
- 谁在追你？ - 我继父和他新妻
-Who's chasing you? -My stepfather and his new wife.

388
00:27:16,536 --> 00:27:18,663
他们一直在利用我
They've been using me.

389
00:27:19,272 --> 00:27:21,570
我的超能力
My abilities.

390
00:27:22,742 --> 00:27:25,006
去偷东西
To steal.

391
00:27:28,414 --> 00:27:30,814
我想停手不干…
I wanted to stop...

392
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,448
…但是他们威胁我
...but they threatened me.

393
00:27:35,121 --> 00:27:37,248
打我
They hit me.

394
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:44,223
你必须保护我，克拉克 只有你能办到
You have to protect me, Clark. You're the only one that can.

395
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:02,507
我来开
I'll get it.

396
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:14,118
你敢说任何事，我就杀了他们
You say anything, and I'll kill them.

397
00:28:16,963 --> 00:28:19,488
你知道我会的
You know I will.

398
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,669
- 你一定是赖恩吧 - 有什么事吗？
-So you must be Ryan. -Can I help you?

399
00:28:23,937 --> 00:28:27,668
肯特先生，儿童保护协会 我来这接赖恩
Mr. Kent, Child Services. I'm here to pick up Ryan.

400
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,365
你来早了 我们本以为你一小时后才来
You're early. We weren't expecting you for an hour.

401
00:28:30,877 --> 00:28:33,311
你们能照顾赖恩，我们很感激
We can't thank you enough for taking Ryan in.

402
00:28:33,613 --> 00:28:36,207
没关系 我们很希望他能呆久些
It's our pleasure. He's welcome to stay longer.

403
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:39,442
这恐怕不行，我要送他去看护中心
Oh, I'm afraid that's impossible. I need to put him in foster care.

404
00:28:39,619 --> 00:28:41,814
这是法律规定
That's the law.

405
00:28:41,988 --> 00:28:44,479
我们去整理你的东西
Let's get your stuff.

406
00:28:48,428 --> 00:28:53,957
我们认为莱恩可能在逃避他的继父 所以我们知会了警方
We think Ryan might be running away from his stepfather, so we alerted the police.

407
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:57,534
别担心，我们会保证他的安全 准备好了吗？
Don't worry, we'll keep him safe. Ready to go?

408
00:28:58,972 --> 00:29:02,430
他可以等等跟我们儿子克拉克道别吗？ 他马上就回来
Could he wait and say goodbye to our son, Clark? He'll be home any minute.

409
00:29:02,609 --> 00:29:04,804
抱歉
Oh, I'm sorry.

410
00:29:04,978 --> 00:29:07,242
没关系，肯特夫人
It's okay, Mrs. Kent.

411
00:29:09,382 --> 00:29:11,316
替我跟他道谢
Just tell him thanks.

412
00:29:11,484 --> 00:29:14,647
如果需要什么，打电话给我们，好吗？
If you need anything, just call us, okay?

413
00:29:28,001 --> 00:29:31,596
爸爸，怎么了？
Dad, what's wrong?

414
00:29:32,639 --> 00:29:35,904
儿童保护协会的人15分钟前 来把赖恩接走了
Child Services came and took Ryan away about 15 minutes ago.

415
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:37,542
啊？
What?

416
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:40,042
他为什么不等我？ 我想跟他道别
Why didn't he wait for me? I wanted to say goodbye.

417
00:29:40,213 --> 00:29:42,374
我不清楚，孩子…
I don't know, son...

418
00:29:42,548 --> 00:29:45,540
…他们说急着走，抱歉
...they said they were in a hurry. I'm sorry.

419
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:06,628
准备去大都会
On your way to Metropolis.

420
00:30:06,973 --> 00:30:10,773
是啊，为了大餐
Yeah, for the big dinner.

421
00:30:10,943 --> 00:30:12,274
我…
I....

422
00:30:12,445 --> 00:30:13,878
我想给你个东西
I wanted you to have something.

423
00:30:16,115 --> 00:30:21,781
- 一把剑？ - 是花剑，每个英雄都应该有一把
-A sword? -It's a foil. Every hero should have one.

424
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:28,254
我猜这意味着你决定离开了
I guess this means you've decided you're leaving.

425
00:30:28,428 --> 00:30:30,953
我还没做出最后决定
I haven't made up my mind one way or the other.

426
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:34,759
如果还没决定 为什么送我离别礼？
If you haven't made up your mind, why are you giving me a going-away present?

427
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:37,232
把剑离那个小孩远一点
Keep that away from the kid.

428
00:30:37,403 --> 00:30:40,770
- 他已经走了 - 我很遗憾
-He's already gone. -I'm sorry.

429
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,965
我知道你很喜欢他
I know how much you liked him.

430
00:30:43,142 --> 00:30:45,872
为了弥补，我希望你能留下来
For what it's worth, I hope you stay.

431
00:31:34,827 --> 00:31:39,457
司机？嘿，怎么了？
Driver? Hey, what's going on?

432
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:41,757
司机？
Driver?

433
00:31:42,702 --> 00:31:44,636
- 进去，快点！ - 你们干什么？
-Inside, come on! -What are you doing?

434
00:31:45,538 --> 00:31:47,529
进去
Get in.

435
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:54,103
卢瑟先生
Mr. Luthor.

436
00:31:55,848 --> 00:31:58,715
- 赖恩？ - 闭嘴
-Ryan? -Shut up.

437
00:31:59,652 --> 00:32:01,210
好了，走，走
Okay, go. Go.

438
00:32:08,394 --> 00:32:10,862
弄到你的信托基金账号太容易了…
Getting the account number to your trust fund was easy...

439
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,395
…现在给我密码
...now give me the password.

440
00:32:12,565 --> 00:32:15,398
- 我不知道你在说什么 - 快告诉我密码是什么，富家子
-I don't know what you're talking about. -Tell me what it is.

441
00:32:15,568 --> 00:32:17,297
我爸才知道，我不知道
My father has it, I don't.

442
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:21,898
他在撒谎
He's lying.

443
00:32:26,379 --> 00:32:28,745
密码，马上给我
Password. Now.

444
00:32:35,254 --> 00:32:37,279
你知道了？
You got it?

445
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:47,932
- 嘿，佐罗，拿剑干什么呢？ - 是花剑
-Hey, Zorro, what's with the sword? -It's a foil.

446
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,695
我猜这是从我们最爱的 百万富翁花花公子那来的礼物
I'm guessing it's a gift from our favorite millionaire playboy.

447
00:32:51,871 --> 00:32:55,102
他在考虑要搬回大都会
He's thinking of moving back to Metropolis.

448
00:32:55,575 --> 00:32:58,408
嗯，我还在这，克拉克 我哪也不会去
Well, I'm still here, Clark. I'm not going anywhere.

449
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:06,417
警长办公室的消息 给了我关于赖恩继父的警告
Sources at the sheriff's office have given me a heads-up on Ryan's stepdad.

450
00:33:06,752 --> 00:33:10,586
- 你在那有门路 - 对啊，交通司里的一个可爱职员
-You have sources. -Yeah, a cute officer in Traffic.

451
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:14,582
我费劲口舌逃掉了一张超速罚单 他说我很有勇气
I talked my way out of a speeding ticket, he told me I was plucky.

452
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,751
也许我该邀请他参加舞会
Maybe I'll ask him to prom.

453
00:33:19,899 --> 00:33:24,598
赖恩的继父来头不小 他是职业罪犯
So Ryan's stepdad is a real catch. He's a career criminal.

454
00:33:27,807 --> 00:33:29,104
这是莱克斯座驾的司机
This is Lex's limo driver.

455
00:33:44,757 --> 00:33:46,315
告诉我密码
Give me the password.

456
00:33:50,563 --> 00:33:52,155
别让我再问一遍
Don't make me ask again.

457
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:56,124
密码是"朱利安"
It's "Julian."

458
00:34:09,749 --> 00:34:13,708
- 莱克斯，你还好吧？ - 应该还行吧
-Lex, are you okay? -Yeah, I think so.

459
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:15,649
他们去哪了？
Which way did they go?

460
00:34:15,821 --> 00:34:20,758
沿90公路直走 克拉克，他们带着赖恩，赶快求助
Straight down Route 90. Clark, they've got Ryan. Get some help.

461
00:34:36,842 --> 00:34:40,972
出来，烧了这豪车，宝贝儿！
Get out. Torch the limo, baby!

462
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:46,850
朱利安，朱利安
Julian. Julian.

463
00:34:53,893 --> 00:34:56,919
给我真正的密码，别惹我
Give me the real password. Don't mess with me.

464
00:34:57,096 --> 00:35:00,190
- 我不会告诉你！ - 我向上帝发誓，我现在就毙了他
-I'm not gonna tell you! -I swear to God, I'll drop him right now.

465
00:35:00,366 --> 00:35:02,857
一旦他拿到了钱，他就会杀了你
Once he gets the money, he's gonna kill you.

466
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:07,837
别听他说，他在挑拨，好把我们分开
Don't listen to him. He's talking trash to pull us apart.

467
00:35:09,108 --> 00:35:13,602
我们的钱就要到手了，宝贝 我们要做的就是彼此信任
We're just about to hit the jackpot, baby. All we've gotta do is trust each other.

468
00:35:14,046 --> 00:35:16,173
你知道的，虽然这孩子总让我生气…
You know, this kid has always freaked me out...

469
00:35:16,349 --> 00:35:19,841
…但我还是会说他从不说谎
...but the one thing I'll say about him is he never lied.

470
00:35:22,922 --> 00:35:25,015
你知道么？
You know what?!

471
00:35:26,158 --> 00:35:28,183
是真的…
That's true...

472
00:35:28,828 --> 00:35:30,386
…他没有说谎
...he didn't.

473
00:35:34,734 --> 00:35:36,531
赖恩！
Ryan!

474
00:35:37,136 --> 00:35:39,900
- 小家伙，你在干什么？ - 叫警察！
-Hey, kid, where are you going? -Call the police!

475
00:35:53,452 --> 00:35:55,181
赖恩！
Ryan!

476
00:36:01,894 --> 00:36:03,987
躲得了一时躲不了一世
You can't hide forever.

477
00:36:15,174 --> 00:36:18,109
你知道，你妈真的恨死你了
You know, your mother really hated you.

478
00:36:18,277 --> 00:36:21,440
她不能容忍生了个怪胎
Couldn't stand having a freak for a son.

479
00:36:21,947 --> 00:36:25,576
想想吧，如果不是那样 我也不会那样对你着迷
Come to think of it, I wasn't that crazy about you either.

480
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:02,937
- 克拉克！ - 没事了，孩子
-Clark! -It's okay, buddy.

481
00:38:11,557 --> 00:38:13,718
现在你安全了
You're safe now.

482
00:38:25,738 --> 00:38:27,865
- 嗨，拉娜 - 嘿
-Hi, Lana. -Hey.

483
00:38:28,274 --> 00:38:30,868
- 赖恩要来告别了 - 你要去哪？
-Ryan would like to say goodbye. -Where are you going?

484
00:38:31,043 --> 00:38:32,806
边缘城市
Edge City.

485
00:38:33,312 --> 00:38:37,078
克罗伊的调查在那儿找到了他姑姑 她今天下午就会来
Chloe's research turned up an aunt there. She's coming by this afternoon.

486
00:38:37,249 --> 00:38:39,809
我要谢谢你给的关于斯凯的建议
I wanted to thank you for your advice on Skye.

487
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:43,785
你是对的，她偷钱柜里的钱
You were right. She was stealing from the till.

488
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,952
- 嘿 - 哇
-Hey. -Wow.

489
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:52,263
谢谢你
Thank you.

490
00:38:54,366 --> 00:38:56,425
我觉得你让他这一年都心花怒放了
I think you made his year.

491
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:02,639
所以你恢复了吗？
So you recover yet?

492
00:39:03,409 --> 00:39:07,675
不知道，但我肯定陷入爱河了
I don't know, but I'm definitely in love.

493
00:39:09,982 --> 00:39:12,280
正好加入我的俱乐部吧
Join the club.

494
00:39:18,891 --> 00:39:21,382
你没在整理行李吗？
Shouldn't you be packing?

495
00:39:23,062 --> 00:39:26,327
我不回大都会了
I'm not going back to Metropolis.

496
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:30,665
拜托，莱克斯，自从我派你到这来 你都想回去啊…
Come on, Lex, that's all you wanted ever since I assigned you...

497
00:39:30,836 --> 00:39:34,203
…你很善辩地提到这地方像“垃圾工厂”的
...to what you so eloquently refer to as the "crap factory."

498
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:37,035
我知道你为什么想要我回去
I know why you want me back.

499
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:39,609
我快把你逼疯了，是吗？
I'm driving you crazy, aren't I?

500
00:39:39,778 --> 00:39:45,375
我没有在俱乐部通宵玩到早上六点 没有被警察逮捕，我生活一切井然有序
I'm not clubbing till 6:00 a.m., not getting arrested. I'm on track.

501
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:47,280
这就是让你害怕的
That's what scares you.

502
00:39:47,453 --> 00:39:50,650
你想让我回去好监视我
You want me back where you can keep an eye on me.

503
00:39:52,124 --> 00:39:54,115
你想错了，莱克斯
You're making a mistake, Lex.

504
00:39:56,228 --> 00:40:01,165
你知道那些你很喜欢谈论的君王 真正害怕的是什么吗？
You know what those emperors you're so fond of talking about were really afraid of?

505
00:40:01,634 --> 00:40:03,499
是他们的儿子会成功…
That their sons would become successful...

506
00:40:03,669 --> 00:40:06,433
…统帅他们自己的军队通往罗马
...and return to Rome at the head of their own army.

507
00:40:06,605 --> 00:40:09,403
你认为你在斯摩维尔能找到未来
You think you can find your future in Smallville.

508
00:40:11,577 --> 00:40:13,477
我才是你的未来
I'm your future.

509
00:40:13,646 --> 00:40:16,638
来帮我，莱克斯，来大都会帮我
Join me, Lex. Join me in Metropolis.

510
00:40:16,815 --> 00:40:20,012
你等我说这些等了多久？
How long have you been waiting to hear me say those words?

511
00:40:20,185 --> 00:40:23,882
我已经等你说点别的事情更久了
I've waited to hear other things from you for a lot longer.

512
00:40:26,025 --> 00:40:29,859
- 我准备好的时候会回大都会的 - 当你统帅大军的时候？
-I'll return to Metropolis when I'm ready. -At the head of an army?

513
00:40:43,509 --> 00:40:45,875
我们会很想念你的，赖恩
We're really going to miss you, Ryan.

514
00:40:46,045 --> 00:40:49,742
边缘城市很冷 所以我收拾了一些克拉克的旧夹克…
It gets cold in Edge City, so I packed some of Clark's old jackets...

515
00:40:49,915 --> 00:40:52,713
- …你长大后可以穿的 - 谢谢，肯特夫人
-...something for you to grow into. -Thanks, Mrs. Kent.

516
00:40:53,185 --> 00:40:56,018
任何时候你想回这里我们都欢迎你
You're welcome around here any time you want.

517
00:40:57,523 --> 00:41:00,390
我知道你在担心，但是不用
I know what you're worried about, but don't be.

518
00:41:00,793 --> 00:41:03,353
我会保守克拉克的秘密
I'll keep Clark's secret.

519
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:07,695
我知道在这个世上要隐藏好自己该怎样
I know what it's like to have to hide who you are from the world.

520
00:41:14,273 --> 00:41:15,740
她来了
There she is.

521
00:41:19,278 --> 00:41:21,712
你会好好的吧？
You sure you're gonna be all right?

522
00:41:23,115 --> 00:41:25,481
她是个好人
She's a nice person.

523
00:41:25,784 --> 00:41:27,911
只是和我一样紧张罢了
She's just as nervous as I am.

524
00:41:33,525 --> 00:41:36,961
你确定不想知道拉娜对你是怎样的感觉？
Are you sure you don't want to know how Lana feels about you?

525
00:41:37,129 --> 00:41:39,154
我更愿意自己去寻找答案
I prefer to find out on my own.

526
00:41:42,901 --> 00:41:44,459
克拉克…
Clark....

527
00:41:46,138 --> 00:41:47,730
小心点莱克斯
Be careful of Lex.

528
00:41:47,906 --> 00:41:49,498
我知道你喜欢他…
I know you like him...

529
00:41:49,675 --> 00:41:52,143
…但他内心有许多不可告人的黑暗
...but there's a lot of darkness he keeps from the world.

530
00:41:52,411 --> 00:41:54,902
我从他脑中读出来了
