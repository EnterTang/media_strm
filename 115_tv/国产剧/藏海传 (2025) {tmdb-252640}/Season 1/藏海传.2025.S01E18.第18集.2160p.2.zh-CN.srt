00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,500
（学校选举）

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,000
（本周学校选举）

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,600
（选举登记处）

7
00:00:28,514 --> 00:00:32,416
Hey, Sasha, say something presidential.

8
00:00:32,652 --> 00:00:37,715
Whoa, Chloe, slow down. The election hasn't even started yet.

9
00:00:39,025 --> 00:00:41,357
What do you think Sasha's chances are?

10
00:00:41,527 --> 00:00:45,190
Well, she knows the most about student government, she's worked her way up...

11
00:00:45,365 --> 00:00:49,825
...she's on a ton of committees, but she's more of a worker than a leader.

12
00:00:50,803 --> 00:00:52,270
How about Paul?

13
00:00:52,438 --> 00:00:54,406
He's certainly the most qualified...

14
00:00:54,574 --> 00:00:57,975
...but elections aren't about merit, they're about popularity.

15
00:00:58,678 --> 00:01:00,703
Which brings us to Felice.

16
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,144
Head cheerleader and president of the drama club.

17
00:01:03,316 --> 00:01:06,717
That definitely gives her an edge, not to mention that she's really hot.

18
00:01:06,886 --> 00:01:10,151
Yeah, but her name rhymes with the French word for luggage.

19
00:01:10,323 --> 00:01:14,589
Okay, glad to see you're not reaching for reasons to hate her.

20
00:01:18,664 --> 00:01:21,064
I saw you taking Sasha's picture.

21
00:01:21,234 --> 00:01:24,362
Why haven't you taken mine? That qualifies as biased.

22
00:01:24,537 --> 00:01:29,804
I plan on running photos and bios of all the candidates, including you, Felice.

23
00:01:30,309 --> 00:01:33,073
Hey, Chloe, what about the editorial?

24
00:01:33,246 --> 00:01:35,806
You can only endorse one candidate, so who's it gonna be?

25
00:01:36,249 --> 00:01:39,844
Who cares? No matter what she says, people are gonna vote for me.

26
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:44,422
Never underestimate the need for the clinically ambitious to pad their resumes.

27
00:01:46,826 --> 00:01:49,852
You want to avoid the pain and humiliation of losing?

28
00:01:50,096 --> 00:01:52,462
Drop out now.

29
00:02:47,186 --> 00:02:48,551
Ow!

主演:迈克尔・罗森巴姆

37
00:04:02,923 --> 00:04:06,563
我不在乎你是怎么做到

00:04:03,023 --> 00:04:05,153
主演：埃里克・约翰森

39
00:04:06,753 --> 00:04:10,663

46
00:04:27,462 --> 00:04:30,462
超人始创作者:杰瑞・希杰尔和乔・夏斯特

47
00:04:27,762 --> 00:04:31,062
留下，留下

48
00:04:32,062 --> 00:04:34,062
快出现吧

49
00:04:32,262 --> 00:04:34,852
电视策划:阿尔弗雷德・哥夫，麦尔斯・米莱

50
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:40,395
第十八集:雄蜂

51
00:00:28,514 --> 00:00:32,416
萨莎，用主席口吻说点儿什么

52
00:00:32,652 --> 00:00:37,715
克罗伊，急什么，竞选还没开始呢

53
00:00:39,025 --> 00:00:41,357
你认为萨莎的优势在哪？

54
00:00:41,527 --> 00:00:45,190
她熟悉学生管理工作，一心向上爬…

55
00:00:45,365 --> 00:00:49,825
…参加了很多社团组织 但是比起当领导，她更适合实干

56
00:00:50,803 --> 00:00:52,270
那保罗呢？

57
00:00:52,438 --> 00:00:54,406
毫无疑问，他是最有资格的…

58
00:00:54,574 --> 00:00:57,975
但竞选最讲究的不是人的价值，而是知名度

59
00:00:58,678 --> 00:01:00,703
所以要看佛丽丝了

60
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,144
啦啦队长兼戏剧社主席

61
00:01:03,316 --> 00:01:06,717
无疑让她占了优势，何况她还是个辣妹

62
00:01:06,886 --> 00:01:10,151
但她的名字和法语的“行李”一个调

63
00:01:10,323 --> 00:01:14,589
好吧，很高兴你不是在找借口讨厌她

64
00:01:18,664 --> 00:01:21,064
我刚看到你给萨莎拍照

65
00:01:21,234 --> 00:01:24,362
为什么没有给我拍？对我有偏见吧

66
00:01:24,537 --> 00:01:29,804
我打算把所有候选人的照片和履历汇编成册 也包括你，佛丽丝

67
00:01:30,309 --> 00:01:33,073
克罗伊，那社论呢？

68
00:01:33,246 --> 00:01:35,806
你只能支持一个候选人，会是谁？

69
00:01:36,249 --> 00:01:39,844
谁在乎？不管她说什么 人们都会投票给我的

70
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:44,422
有人为了填充简历，还真是野心勃勃

71
00:01:46,826 --> 00:01:49,852
如果不想尝到失败的痛苦和屈辱

72
00:01:50,096 --> 00:01:52,462
现在就退出吧

73
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,362
（我会为你而战，陈保罗）

74
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,166
那真是我最可怕的噩梦
That's gotta be my all-time worst nightmare.

75
00:04:41,366 --> 00:04:43,366
特别客串主演:玛格丽特・莫罗

76
00:04:43,336 --> 00:04:46,897
I get stung by one bee, I swell up like a grapefruit, but over a hundred....

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
客串主演:尚达・法
How'd they get into Paul's bathroom?

78
00:04:43,336 --> 00:04:46,897
曾经被一只蜜蜂蛰，就肿得跟西柚一样 如果有成百上千只的话…

79
00:04:47,073 --> 00:04:49,007
关键是它们怎么飞进保罗浴室的？

80
00:04:49,807 --> 00:04:51,807
切兰・西蒙斯
The Center for Environmental Protection...

81
00:04:49,175 --> 00:04:51,143
环保中心…

82
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,778
…从大都市派了小组来调查
...is sending a team from Metropolis to investigate.

83
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,500
神川宏奈幸
Guess that's gonna shake up our class election.

84
00:04:53,946 --> 00:04:56,073
我猜肯定会让选举结果大变

85
00:04:56,249 --> 00:04:59,218
不会，我是说，保罗的名字还在候选名单上…
Not really. I mean, Paul's name is still on the ballot...

86
00:04:59,385 --> 00:05:02,513
…到秋天才要就职，那时他应该已经好了
...and he wouldn't take office until fall. He could recover by then.

87
00:05:02,313 --> 00:05:04,313
监督制片:马克・伏黑顿
Out of sight, out of mind.

88
00:05:02,688 --> 00:05:04,679
久别情疏

89
00:05:04,857 --> 00:05:07,087
要我说，他只能得到几张同情票
My call, he gets a few sympathy votes. That's it.

90
00:05:06,287 --> 00:05:08,287
制片人:迈克尔・格林
-Nice to see the softer side of Pete. -Seriously.

91
00:05:10,387 --> 00:05:12,387
制片人:道里斯・伊根
Anyway, there's a new candidate on the horizon who is gonna make things interesting.

92
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,922
- 很高兴看到皮特心软的一面 - 是啊

93
00:05:10,096 --> 00:05:14,226
不管怎样，眼前就有个新候选人 有他在，会很有趣的

94
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,334
是吗，那是谁呢？
Oh, yeah, who's that?

95
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,112
（克拉克・肯特竞选主席）

96
00:05:20,873 --> 00:05:24,070
- 你干了什么？ - 我从你身上预见到很好的政治前景
-What have you done? -I see a big future ahead of you in politics.

97
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,370
联合制片:格雷格・沃克

98
00:05:24,243 --> 00:05:26,040
你坦率正直，受人喜爱
You're straightforward. People like you.

99
00:05:26,912 --> 00:05:29,437
- 不行，肯定不行 - 你具备所有条件
-No way. Definitely not. -You've got the whole package:

100
00:05:29,137 --> 00:05:31,137
制片人:鲍勃・哈格罗夫
Looks, brains, and that whole farm-boy charm.

101
00:05:33,352 --> 00:05:34,979
Did I mention the perks of power?

102
00:05:35,154 --> 00:05:38,419
-lf it was so great, why didn't you run? -I know my strengths.

103
00:05:38,591 --> 00:05:41,253
I'm more the power behind the throne.

104
00:05:41,427 --> 00:05:44,555
The guy behind the guy. The one who makes it all happen.

105
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,698
-Pete Ross, the kingmaker. -Exactly.

106
00:05:46,866 --> 00:05:50,632
All you gotta do is show up, shake a couple hands, give a speech. It's easy.

107
00:05:50,803 --> 00:05:53,863
And we wonder why our politicians aren't great leaders.

108
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,771
<i>Clark, Clark, Clark, Clark....</i>

109
00:06:04,137 --> 00:06:06,137
联合执行制片:肯・霍顿

110
00:05:29,615 --> 00:05:32,175
外表，头脑，还有农场男孩的魅力

111
00:05:33,352 --> 00:05:34,979
我刚还漏说了超大力这一点

112
00:05:35,154 --> 00:05:38,419
- 既然主席那么好，你怎么不去竞选？ - 我有自知之明

113
00:05:38,591 --> 00:05:41,253
我更适合做权力背后的人

114
00:05:41,427 --> 00:05:44,555
成功人士背后的支持者 帮别人把成功成为实现的人

115
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,698
- 皮特・罗斯，国王拥立者 - 完全正确

116
00:05:46,866 --> 00:05:50,632
你只要露个面，挥挥手，做个演讲，很容易

117
00:05:50,803 --> 00:05:53,863
真奇怪为何我们的政治家还不是伟大领导人

118
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,771
<i>克拉克，克拉克…</i>

119

120
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:12,571
导演:迈克尔・卡特曼

121
00:06:31,143 --> 00:06:33,873
- 看来你需要帮助 - 不，我能搞定
-You look like you could use some help. -No, I'm fine.

122
00:06:34,046 --> 00:06:38,005
汉斯，我要你到90号路，公馆东面两英里
Hans, I need you out on Route 90, two miles east of the mansion.

123
00:06:38,184 --> 00:06:41,210
- 一辆红色野马车引擎出问题了 - 你这是干什么？
-A red Mustang with engine trouble. -What are you doing?

124
00:06:41,387 --> 00:06:43,082
打电话给我修车工
Calling my mechanic.

125
00:06:43,255 --> 00:06:47,783
不是我不欣赏你的现代骑士精神 但我说过自己能搞定
Not that I don't appreciate your attempt at postmodern chivalry, but I said I was fine.

126
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,758
穿D&G，谈吐文雅
Dolce & Gabbana and a vocabulary?

127
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,525
你的言行完全是大都会的风格 怎么会来斯摩维尔？
You've got Metropolis written all over you. What brings you to Smallville?

128
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,861
你是来赶我走的警察吗？
You're the sheriff come to run me out of town?

129
00:06:57,036 --> 00:07:00,699
你的态度是跟这身衣服一套的？还是点缀？
Did the attitude come with the couture, or was it an accessory?

130
00:07:00,873 --> 00:07:03,398
既然你非问不可，我正考虑搬来这儿
If you must know, I'm thinking about moving here.

131
00:07:03,576 --> 00:07:07,171
我想打听下这里情况，但你看着不像本地人
I'd ask you what it's like, but you don't look like a local.

132
00:07:07,346 --> 00:07:11,976
我从去年秋天起就住这儿 起初迫切地想走，但后来越住越融入
I've lived here since last fall. I couldn't wait to get out, but it's growing on me.

133
00:07:12,151 --> 00:07:15,780
为什么会改变？ 这里诺曼洛克维尔的格调诱惑了你？
Well, why the change? The Norman Rockwell ambiance seduce you?

134
00:07:15,955 --> 00:07:19,322
外表只是假象，这儿所有东西都另有故事
Appearance is deceptive. Nothing around here is what it seems.

135
00:07:19,492 --> 00:07:22,518
吊人胃口啊，是什么意思？
I'm intrigued. What do you mean?

136
00:07:22,695 --> 00:07:26,358
这些问题听着有点像采访了
All these questions. This is beginning to sound like an interview.

137
00:07:33,172 --> 00:07:36,039
- 你给谁做事？ - 不知道你在说什么
-Who do you work for? -I don't know what you're talking about.

138
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:40,838
如果我把它扔进林子，你就真需要一辆拖车了
If I toss these into the woods, you really are gonna need a tow truck.

139
00:07:42,314 --> 00:07:46,182
凯瑞・卡索，我是《大都会日报》的记者
<i>Carrie Castle. I'm a staff reporter for the Metropolis Journal.</i>

140
00:07:46,786 --> 00:07:48,754
我不接受采访，卡索小姐
I don't grant interviews, Ms. Castle.

141
00:07:48,921 --> 00:07:52,550
我大半辈子都在躲着你们这种人
I've spent most of my life taking back entrances to avoid people like you.

142
00:07:52,725 --> 00:07:55,717
等一下，听我说，我想为你写篇专访
Wait. Just listen. I want to write an article about you.

143
00:07:57,897 --> 00:08:01,025
你就靠这句话打动我？写我的文章多了去了
That's your pitch? There are articles written about me all the time.

144
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,000
但在那些文章里，您不是被开除的小混混 就是莱诺・卢瑟被宠坏的儿子
But you're either dismissed as a wild child or the spoiled son of Lionel Luthor.

145
00:08:05,304 --> 00:08:07,431
虽然您在《询查报》那里挽回了些许名声…
<i>You've gotten some good press in the Inquisitor...</i>

146
00:08:07,606 --> 00:08:12,509
但我们的报纸不是那种街头小报，我们受尊重 能帮助您改善形象
<i>...but the Journal is not a tabloid. It's respected. It could help change your image.</i>

147
00:08:12,678 --> 00:08:16,045
- 你有什么想法？ - 写一篇封面报道描述您在斯摩维尔的工作
-What did you have in mind? -A cover profile on your work in Smallville.

148
00:08:16,215 --> 00:08:17,739
那篇文章会保持公允…
It will be fair and accurate...

149
00:08:17,917 --> 00:08:21,284
…同时帮您适当摆脱父亲的阴影
...and will give you the legitimacy you need to get out of your father's shadow.

150
00:08:21,454 --> 00:08:23,547
推动我事业的同时宣传你自己
Launching my career and conveniently your own.

151
00:08:24,957 --> 00:08:28,916
我欣赏你的努力，卡索小姐，但我还是拒绝
I admire the effort, Ms. Castle, but I have to decline.

152
00:08:31,497 --> 00:08:33,988
不过你倒挺会穿衣服的
You get points for style, though.

153
00:08:46,745 --> 00:08:48,406
我不敢相信皮特干的好事
I can't believe Pete did this.

154
00:08:48,581 --> 00:08:52,517
有些人天生伟大 有些人被动地卷入其中，苦苦挣扎
Some men are born to greatness, others are dragged into it, kicking and screaming.

155
00:08:52,685 --> 00:08:55,119
克拉克？怎么回事？你为何要参选？
Clark? What's going on? Why are you running?

156
00:08:55,287 --> 00:08:57,585
你从未对学生会表现出兴趣
You've never shown interest in student government.

157
00:08:57,756 --> 00:09:00,122
别紧张，只是个恶作剧，皮特提名我的
Don't worry, it's just a gag. Pete nominated me.

158
00:09:00,292 --> 00:09:02,419
- 那你会退选？ - 对
-So you're taking your name off the ballot? -Yeah.

159
00:09:02,595 --> 00:09:06,087
很好，因为这次选举太重要了，不能沦为笑话
Well, good, because this election is way too important to turn into a joke.

160
00:09:06,265 --> 00:09:07,857
有佛丽丝搅和就够乱的了
It's bad enough with Felice.

161
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:11,594
我听说她要找乐队搞餐会 搞一个选举前的狂欢
I hear she's throwing a pre-election bash with a band and catering.

162
00:09:13,138 --> 00:09:17,507
她想像买名牌包包一样买下这次选举吗！
She is trying to buy this election like one of her Prada bags!

163
00:09:18,744 --> 00:09:21,406
还真是神经质
Talk about tightly wound.

164
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,640
克罗伊，我虽没打算过，但如果我参加 你觉得会不会当选？
Not that I'm planning to, but if I ran, you think I'd have a shot?

165
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:28,251
会啊，只要我能当选啦啦队长
Yeah, right after I'm elected head cheerleader.

166
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:35,852
克拉克・肯特，竞选主席？
Clark Kent for president?

167
00:09:36,028 --> 00:09:39,156
别担心，我明天就退出
Oh, don't worry, I'm pulling my name out tomorrow.

168
00:09:39,698 --> 00:09:41,723
- 我倒认为这个想法非常棒 - 是吗？
-I think this is a terrific idea. -You do?

169
00:09:41,901 --> 00:09:46,361
你总说没有机会表现，因为橄榄球不能参加…
You always say that you don't get a chance to shine because football is off-limits...

170
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:49,064
- …或许这次是你的机会 - 我以为你会不同意
-...maybe this is your opportunity. -I assumed you'd say no.

171
00:09:49,241 --> 00:09:53,234
- 竞选学生会如此公开隆重 - 但不需要你使用超能力…
-Student government is such a public thing. -It doesn't require you to use your gifts...

172
00:09:53,412 --> 00:09:56,506
…并且这你完全可以自主的校园活动
...and it's a school activity you can make your own.

173
00:09:56,882 --> 00:10:00,181
怎么了，儿子？ 看起来你对这件事不是很乐意啊
Hey, what's the matter, son? You don't look too happy about this.

174
00:10:00,352 --> 00:10:01,683
Hey-- Hey.

175
00:10:02,621 --> 00:10:05,556
我平常都是尽量远离聚光灯
I've always tried to stay out of the spotlight.

176
00:10:05,724 --> 00:10:07,658
我们没有一定要你去竞选
Well, nobody's saying you have to run.

177
00:10:07,826 --> 00:10:11,557
你可以退出，但是要记住 一旦你习惯了放弃，可能这辈子都改不了
You can quit if you want, but remember, quitting's a very hard habit to break.

178
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:16,531
别给我压力
No pressure.

179
00:10:26,011 --> 00:10:28,104
这个地方真是…
Wow, the place is....

180
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,440
空荡荡？
Empty?

181
00:10:29,615 --> 00:10:31,082
没人？
Deserted?

182
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,842
很闲？
Vacant?

183
00:10:33,018 --> 00:10:36,681
我想找一个比较委婉的说法 不过的确…
Well, I was searching for a euphemism to say that, but...yeah.

184
00:10:36,855 --> 00:10:39,688
自从开张，另家咖啡馆就一直挤兑我们
The Beanery's tried to put us out of business since we opened.

185
00:10:39,858 --> 00:10:42,622
我尝试过优惠券，降价，还有广告…
<i>I have tried coupons, price cuts, even ads in the Ledger...</i>

186
00:10:42,795 --> 00:10:46,993
…但依然没什么改善，照这样下去 一个月就要关门大吉了
...so far nothing's worked. At this rate, we'll have to close the doors in a month.

187
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:50,602
跟莱克斯谈过吗？ 他是投资者，肯定能帮上忙
Have you spoken to Lex? He's an investor, I'm sure he can help.

188
00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:53,101
他很反常，特别沉默
He's been uncharacteristically silent.

189
00:10:53,272 --> 00:10:58,209
况且，这是我自己的战斗 输赢全在自己，我一定要赢
Besides, this is my battle to win or lose, and I am determined to win.

190
00:10:58,377 --> 00:11:02,313
说起这个，我听说你也有场仗要打
Speaking of which, I hear you've got a battle of your own on your hands.

191
00:11:02,481 --> 00:11:05,644
是选举，不过我没打算正式参选
Oh, yeah, the election. I'm not really running.

192
00:11:05,818 --> 00:11:09,345
太可惜了，我觉得你会是个不错的主席
That's too bad. I think you'd make a great class president.

193
00:11:09,521 --> 00:11:10,954
- 真的么？ - 当然了
-Really? -Yeah.

194
00:11:11,123 --> 00:11:14,786
你很诚实，人们信任你 你有与生俱来的正义感
You're honest, people trust you. And you have this innate sense of justice.

195
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,624
当有人受到不公正的待遇时 我能从你脸上看出有多么不满
I can see it on your face how upset you get when you think somebody's being mistreated.

196
00:11:19,798 --> 00:11:22,460
- 你真的这么认为么？  -是
-You see all that in me? -Yes, I do.

197
00:11:30,309 --> 00:11:32,607
克拉克.肯特竞选主席
Clark Kent for president.

198
00:11:32,778 --> 00:11:35,144
你怎么知道我参加竞选？
How'd you know I was running?

199
00:11:35,314 --> 00:11:37,680
在镇上时，有人放到我挡风玻璃上的
I found this on my windshield in town.

200
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:40,216
帮我竞选那位干事有点头脑发热
I have an overzealous campaign manager.

201
00:11:40,386 --> 00:11:42,820
没发现你还有从政的抱负
I didn't realize you had political aspirations.

202
00:11:42,988 --> 00:11:45,582
没有，只是觉得自己可以做点成绩
I don't. I just figured I could make a difference.

203
00:11:45,758 --> 00:11:49,785
你过来是为竞选筹捐的吗？
Did you swing by for a campaign contribution?

204
00:11:50,396 --> 00:11:53,422
其实，我想问你是否知道塔龙的情况
Actually, I was wondering if you knew about the Talon.

205
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:56,159
你是说过去两周一直没有生意？
You mean the fact that it's been empty the last two weeks?

206
00:11:56,335 --> 00:11:58,895
你会帮拉娜么？她已经用尽了办法
Do you plan on helping Lana out? She's tried everything.

207
00:11:59,071 --> 00:12:02,131
其实她做得很不错
She's doing an admirable job.

208
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,104
- 如果塔龙歇业了… - 克拉克…
-lf the Talon goes under.... -Clark...

209
00:12:05,377 --> 00:12:09,473
…我不会去补贴个一直赔钱的买卖 塔龙必须得自寻出路
...I won't subsidize a money-losing operation. The Talon has to find its own feet.

210
00:12:09,648 --> 00:12:13,084
你至少可以去看看，表示下支持
Well, you could at least stop by and show some solidarity.

211
00:12:13,252 --> 00:12:16,449
看，你已经开始为选民谋福利了
See? You're already working for your constituents.

212
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:20,153
需要些建议么？
You want some advice?

213
00:12:20,325 --> 00:12:23,021
我认为你需要一个更好的竞选口号
I think you need a better slogan.

214
00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:26,159
所有人都用过这个口号， 包括我
Everybody's used this one, including me.

215
00:12:27,232 --> 00:12:30,133
- 你竞选过学生会？ - 一次
-You ran for student office. -Once.

216
00:12:30,302 --> 00:12:33,328
- 但是我的动机不是很高尚 - 赢了么？
-But my aspirations weren't very noble. -Did you win?

217
00:12:33,706 --> 00:12:36,072
当然
Of course.

218
00:12:36,241 --> 00:12:38,141
有什么建议么？
Do you have any tips?

219
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:42,474
你不需要我的办法 用你自己的方法就可以胜出
You don't need my methods. You'll win on your own terms.

220
00:12:42,648 --> 00:12:44,013
竞争很残酷
Competition's pretty stiff.

221
00:12:44,183 --> 00:12:46,413
好好斗争不会有错…记住…
There's nothing wrong with a good fight. Remember...

222
00:12:46,585 --> 00:12:50,385
…明日之星都需要今天的打拼
...the man of tomorrow is forged by his battles today.

223
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:55,126
我能用你那句话吗？ 用“明日之星”来作为我的竞选口号？
Could I use that? I mean, "the man of tomorrow," for my slogan?

224
00:12:56,829 --> 00:12:59,627
尽管用
Knock yourself out.

225
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
（克拉克・肯特，明日之星）

226
00:13:13,412 --> 00:13:16,575
"克拉克・肯特，明日之星” 有点太狂妄了吧，你不觉得么？
"Clark Kent, man of tomorrow." Kind of presumptuous, don't you think?

227
00:13:16,749 --> 00:13:19,149
- 我喜欢 - 还以为你准备退出了
-I like it. -I thought you were bagging the election.

228
00:13:19,318 --> 00:13:21,479
我改变心意了
I had a change of heart.

229
00:13:21,653 --> 00:13:23,746
“明日之星”，真是抢眼
"Man of tomorrow." Very catchy.

230
00:13:23,922 --> 00:13:26,254
谢谢，也谢谢你的鼓励
Thank you. And thank you for the encouragement.

231
00:13:26,425 --> 00:13:27,585
我投你一票
You've got my vote.

232
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,923
我可以在塔龙举行选举聚会 顺便帮你招揽些人
I could have my election rally at the Talon, help bring people by.

233
00:13:31,096 --> 00:13:34,259
太好了，有消息来找我
That sounds great. You know where to find me.

234
00:13:34,433 --> 00:13:35,593
- 再见，拉娜 - 再见
-Bye, Lana. -Bye.

235
00:13:36,468 --> 00:13:39,232
你是因为拉娜才参加竞选，难怪呢？
You're running because of Lana. Why am I not surprised?

236
00:13:39,404 --> 00:13:41,736
我参加竞选，是因为我觉得我能干好
I'm running because I think I can do a good job.

237
00:13:41,907 --> 00:13:45,570
- 好吧，克拉克，随便你了 - 你知道么，皮特对我有信心，拉娜也是
-All right, Clark, whatever. -Pete has faith in me and so does Lana.

238
00:13:45,744 --> 00:13:48,178
- 有趣的是，你没有支持我 - 告诉我你的立场所在？
-It's interesting that you don't. -What do you stand for?

239
00:13:48,347 --> 00:13:51,373
我坚持事实，正义，还有其他的
I stand for truth, justice and other stuff.

240
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:55,242
具体点，比如在某些重要问题上的观点？
You wanna be a little more specific, tell me where you stand on the issues?

241
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,912
- 你想谈论什么问题？ - 比如削减文艺预算的计划…
-What issues do you wanna talk about? -There's the plan to cut the arts budget...

242
00:13:59,091 --> 00:14:02,117
…餐厅的食品营养过低 有关着装要求的争议…
...the appalling nutritional value of cafeteria meals, the dress code...

243
00:14:02,294 --> 00:14:05,559
…还有学校搜查储物柜侵犯学生隐私问题
...and not to mention the student privacy issues with the locker searches.

244
00:14:05,731 --> 00:14:07,722
慢点，我昨晚才决定参选
Slow down. I just decided to run last night.

245
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:12,132
我觉得“明日之星”得在今天就做出规划
Okay, well, I think the man of tomorrow needs to get a platform for today.

246
00:14:16,642 --> 00:14:19,509
今天下午有一场女子排球比赛
Okay, there's a girls' volleyball game this afternoon.

247
00:14:19,678 --> 00:14:22,203
你可以露个脸，拉些运动员的选票
You can make an appearance, court the jock vote.

248
00:14:22,381 --> 00:14:26,044
星期五要空出来，有场音乐会 虽然演出很差，但你出现的时候…
Keep Friday clear, there's a band concert. They suck, but you've got to be seen...

249
00:14:26,218 --> 00:14:28,379
- …要表现得像一名艺术爱好者 - 那我正经的主席规划会是怎样？
-...as a friend of the arts. -What about my platform?

250
00:14:28,554 --> 00:14:30,954
谁在乎那个，大家喜欢你，就会投你票
Who cares? If people like you, they'll vote for you.

251
00:14:31,123 --> 00:14:34,320
- 演讲时我该说些什么？ - 不知道，我不懂演讲的事
-What am I gonna say in my speech? -I don't know. I don't do speeches.

252
00:14:34,493 --> 00:14:37,929
午饭见，我们可以在餐厅拉选票
See you at lunch. We can canvass the cafeteria.

253
00:15:13,532 --> 00:15:16,399
他们以为自己是谁啊
Who do they think they are?

254
00:15:26,378 --> 00:15:28,710
停下！
Stop!

255
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,350
现在不行，我有事要做
Not now. I have work to do.

256
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,550
（小镇高中火炬报）

257
00:16:05,183 --> 00:16:07,583
克罗伊，有时间帮我们贴些海报么？
Any chance you could help us hang some posters?

258
00:16:07,753 --> 00:16:10,813
皮特说如果我名字到处贴满，就肯定能赢
Pete's convinced if he puts my name on enough wall space, I'll win.

259
00:16:10,989 --> 00:16:15,187
作一名公正的新闻人员，我正在做蜜蜂的报道
Besides needing to be an impartial member of the fourth estate, I'm doing my bee story.

260
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,884
环保中心有什么新的收获？
C.E.P. find anything new?

261
00:16:17,062 --> 00:16:19,792
蜂群并不是从正常的栖息地迁来的
The swarms didn't migrate from any of their usual places.

262
00:16:19,965 --> 00:16:22,525
本州所有的养蜂人都发现他们的蜂巢空了
Beekeepers all over the state have found their hives empty.

263
00:16:22,701 --> 00:16:24,931
所有蜂群就像突然消失了
It's like the colonies just up and left.

264
00:16:25,103 --> 00:16:28,937
这很奇怪，蜜蜂是群居性动物 通常不会轻易离开自己的巢穴
That's weird. Bees are followers. They wouldn't desert their hive without reason.

265
00:16:30,575 --> 00:16:33,510
我妈妈对探索频道很着迷
My mom's addicted to Discovery Channel.

266
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:36,580
- 主席规划进行得怎么样了？ - 还没有开始做
-So how goes the platform? -I haven't started working on it yet.

267
00:16:36,748 --> 00:16:40,184
一直忙着和人见面，周末也被邀参加派对
I've been so busy meeting people. I even got invited to parties this weekend.

268
00:16:40,352 --> 00:16:44,220
不敢相信，区区一天时间 就让你为了人气而妥协了
I can't believe it took one day for you to be compromised by the lure of popularity.

269
00:16:44,523 --> 00:16:47,788
我当选之后记得提醒我帮你拉赞助
Remind me to pull your funding after I'm elected.

270
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,485
说起这个，最新一版的在哪儿？
Speaking of which, where's the latest edition?

271
00:16:50,796 --> 00:16:53,060
别，别，别！还没有校对完呢
No, no, no! I'm not done proofing it yet.

272
00:16:53,231 --> 00:16:55,665
你最好别看，还没完工！
You shouldn't be looking at it yet. It's not done!

273
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:59,395
怕什么，我一直在校正你的标点问题
Come on, I've been correcting your comma issues since your first laptop.

274
00:16:59,595 --> 00:17:00,595
（支持保罗参选）

275
00:17:02,474 --> 00:17:05,136
- 你支持保罗？ - 克拉克，我必须要客观
-You endorsed Paul? -Clark, I had to be objective.

276
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:08,279
保罗还未退出，他秋天就会回来
Paul's still in the race, and he'll be back by fall.

277
00:17:08,447 --> 00:17:10,745
你这么积极参加是好事…
It's great that you're all gung-ho and slogany now...

278
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:13,885
…但都是因为皮特的恶作剧
...but the truth is, you only ran because Pete suckered you into it.

279
00:17:14,052 --> 00:17:17,283
保罗在正经问题上的立场很清楚 这点比你强
Paul has a clear stance on issues you have yet to articulate.

280
00:17:17,456 --> 00:17:20,448
- 这跟个人关系要分开 - 我知道的，克罗伊
-It's nothing personal. -I understand, Chloe.

281
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,448
（本周拿铁半价）

282
00:17:33,138 --> 00:17:36,073
伙计们，竞选游说的休息？
Hey, guys. Taking a break from the campaign trail?

283
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,941
很惊奇学校里有那么多我不认识的人
It's amazing how many people at school I don't know.

284
00:17:39,111 --> 00:17:42,012
稍做休息，想试试你的半价套餐
This is a pit stop. Wanted to take advantage of your two-for-one deal.

285
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,206
这招再不行，只能找露胸女服务员了
Figure that's the last step before I institute topless waitressing.

286
00:17:45,384 --> 00:17:48,911
好吧，那我希望这招不行
Well, here's to hoping it fails miserably.

287
00:17:50,322 --> 00:17:53,849
- 看来你有顾客了 - 是惠特尼逼他们来的
-It looks like you have customers. -They're here because Whitney forced them.

288
00:17:54,026 --> 00:17:56,494
路过另家咖啡馆，他们好像人挺多
Yeah, I passed by the Beanery. They're kind of busy.

289
00:17:56,661 --> 00:18:01,360
那老板过来，说他就是要搞垮我们
The owner stopped by. He said he's made it his mission to run this place into the ground.

290
00:18:01,533 --> 00:18:05,526
然后他还敢告诉我 跟个人关系无关，只是生意
Then he had the nerve to tell me that it wasn't personal, just business.

291
00:18:05,704 --> 00:18:07,934
怎么40岁以上的人都喜欢引用《教父》？
<i>Why does everyone over 40 quote The Godfather?</i>

292
00:18:08,106 --> 00:18:11,598
不知道，但真的很烦人
I don't know, but it's really annoying.

293
00:18:11,977 --> 00:18:15,606
- 竞选的事怎么样了？ - 真是个很大的挑战
-So how's political life treating you? -It's definitely a challenge.

294
00:18:15,781 --> 00:18:19,581
- 关键时候才看出谁是真朋友 - 演讲稿准备怎么样了？
-It shows you who your real friends are. -How's your speech going?

295
00:18:19,751 --> 00:18:23,187
- 还没开始写呢 - 说不定我能帮你
-I haven't started writing it yet. -Maybe I could help you with that.

296
00:18:23,355 --> 00:18:25,550
- 明天过来，我们一起写 - 真的？
-Come by tomorrow. We can work on it. -Really?

297
00:18:26,124 --> 00:18:28,752
真是太棒了，你确定有空么？
That would be great. You sure you have enough time?

298
00:18:29,061 --> 00:18:30,426
看看就知道了
Look around.

299
00:18:30,595 --> 00:18:35,328
除非惠特尼逼着整个球队来 要么，我就应该有空
Unless Whitney can coerce the baseball team, I think I can squeeze you in.

300
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,128
很高兴看到生意有起色
Glad to see business is booming.

301
00:18:38,303 --> 00:18:41,204
连老顾客都不来，生意当然难做
It's hard when even your regular customers blow you off.

302
00:18:41,373 --> 00:18:44,399
我没有不理这边，我有注意到情况如何
I haven't been blowing you off. I've had my eye on the situation.

303
00:18:44,576 --> 00:18:48,103
- 等着看我失败呢 - 大多数新人的生意都不会成功
-Waiting for me to fail. -Most new ventures don't make it.

304
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,214
要做好失败的准备
Prepare yourself for that possibility.

305
00:18:50,382 --> 00:18:52,441
- 我以为你不喜欢输 - 我是不喜欢
-I thought you didn't like to lose. -I don't.

306
00:18:52,617 --> 00:18:54,084
但是这不是我的战争
But it's not my fight.

307
00:18:54,252 --> 00:18:57,710
- 作为投资者，必须知道何时放弃 - 你觉得我该怎么做？
-You have to know when to cut your losses. -So, what do you suggest I do?

308
00:18:57,889 --> 00:19:01,347
那家咖啡店挑起了战争 如果你想生存，就要创新
The Beanery declared war. If you wanna hold on to this place, get creative.

309
00:19:01,526 --> 00:19:04,086
要愿意做些不干净行为
Be willing to get your hands dirty.

310
00:19:04,696 --> 00:19:07,130
不要担心，我不是让你干违法的事
Don't worry, I'm not suggesting anything illegal.

311
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:10,063
用《教父》的话来说，“该上床了”
<i>To quote The Godfather, "It's time to go to the mattresses."</i>

312
00:19:11,503 --> 00:19:15,371
那部电影该被免费频道禁播
That movie should be banned from basic cable.

313
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:22,740
不要问
Don't ask.

314
00:19:26,451 --> 00:19:28,817
好吧，拜
All right. Bye.

315
00:19:28,987 --> 00:19:31,387
佛丽丝，我能和你说句话么？
Felice, can I talk to you a minute?

316
00:19:31,556 --> 00:19:33,956
你还有55秒钟，说吧
You've got 55 seconds left. Go.

317
00:19:34,126 --> 00:19:35,923
我做了个决定
I've made a decision.

318
00:19:36,094 --> 00:19:38,085
你要退出吧
You're planning on dropping out.

319
00:19:38,263 --> 00:19:41,664
不是，我觉得你该退出
No, I've decided you need to drop out.

320
00:19:42,701 --> 00:19:45,465
相信我，这是不可能的
Trust me, that's not gonna happen.

321
00:19:45,637 --> 00:19:48,333
你还没听说吧，我是领先者
In case you haven't heard, I'm the front-runner.

322
00:19:48,507 --> 00:19:52,034
因为男人根本认不出最好的候选人
That's because these drones wouldn't know a qualified candidate if they saw one.

323
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:54,007
小地方就是会这样
That's the problem with this place.

324
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:56,713
就像是一个蜂窝有两个蜂后
It's like a hive with two queens.

325
00:19:56,982 --> 00:20:01,544
如果你懂点自然常识，就知道总有一个失败
Well, if you knew anything about nature, you'd realize one always goes down.

326
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,881
知道么，你真是个怪人
You know what? You're a freak.

327
00:20:06,324 --> 00:20:07,848
好吧，随你的便
Okay, have it your way.

328
00:20:08,026 --> 00:20:11,518
但记住，我已经跟你心平气和地说过
But just remember, I did ask nicely.

329
00:20:15,634 --> 00:20:20,628
- 盖比，今天最让我舒服的就是你 - 谢谢你，卢瑟先生
-Gabby, you're the best part of my day. -Thank you, Mr. Luthor.

330
00:20:23,141 --> 00:20:25,439
- 你不是盖比 - 她今天不能来了
-You're not Gabby. -She couldn't make it.

331
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:28,272
你最好现在就离开，卡索小姐
Now would be a good time for you to leave, Ms. Castle.

332
00:20:28,446 --> 00:20:30,471
人们总是服从你？
Do people always do what you say?

333
00:20:30,649 --> 00:20:32,014
有什么不对吗？
Is that unusual?

334
00:20:32,184 --> 00:20:35,415
我记得你说你欣赏坚持不懈
I thought you said you appreciated persistence.

335
00:20:35,587 --> 00:20:39,023
我现在做得不好吗？
Besides, aren't I doing a good job?

336
00:20:39,658 --> 00:20:42,525
你很幸运
Lucky for you.

337
00:20:43,061 --> 00:20:45,996
花了很久才弄清楚什么能吸引你…
It took a while to figure out what would tempt you...

338
00:20:46,164 --> 00:20:48,724
…我恍然大悟
...and then it hit me.

339
00:20:50,435 --> 00:20:53,268
报纸封面照片比不上那句话重要…
<i>It's not your picture on the Journal cover so much as the words...</i>

340
00:20:53,438 --> 00:20:56,601
…大写的“长江后浪推前浪”
..."Son Outshines Father" in the caption.

341
00:20:56,775 --> 00:20:58,470
我做得怎么样？
How am I doing?

342
00:20:58,643 --> 00:21:00,838
往下一点
A little lower.

343
00:21:01,012 --> 00:21:02,479
让我猜猜
Let me guess.

344
00:21:02,647 --> 00:21:05,707
编辑许诺，如果搞定我，就给你专栏
Your editor promised you your own column if you land me.

345
00:21:05,884 --> 00:21:09,513
- 那你能想象我会多感激你了 - 我觉得我能
-You can imagine how appreciative I'd be. -I think I can.

346
00:21:09,688 --> 00:21:12,919
告诉我，莱克斯，我的机会超过50%了…
Tell me, Lex, would you say my chances are above-average...

347
00:21:13,091 --> 00:21:15,116
…还是没有？
...or below?

348
00:21:15,293 --> 00:21:19,252
就像我说的，我一直欣赏坚持不懈
Like I said, I always appreciate persistence.

349
00:21:19,431 --> 00:21:21,456
你不会后悔的
You won't regret this.

350
00:21:21,633 --> 00:21:24,227
还不是时候，凯瑟小姐
Not yet, Ms. Castle.

351
00:21:24,402 --> 00:21:27,235
我付了一小时的帐
I paid for an hour.

352
00:22:01,206 --> 00:22:02,935
佛丽丝・钱德勒，怎么了？
Felice Chandler, what's the problem?

353
00:22:19,157 --> 00:22:20,681
给克拉克投票
Vote for Clark.

354
00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:23,327
给克拉克投票
Vote for Clark.

355
00:22:25,063 --> 00:22:28,965
我一直以为和陌生人打交道会很难 其实还挺有意思的
I thought meeting people would be the worst part, but it's actually kind of fun.

356
00:22:29,134 --> 00:22:33,400
我很高兴你这么觉得 因为根据我的午餐调查…
I'm glad you feel that way, because according to my latest lunchtime poll...

357
00:22:33,571 --> 00:22:35,539
…你进展很不错
...you've got a shot.

358
00:22:36,308 --> 00:22:37,332
你们好
Hey.

359
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,439
你好
Hey.

360
00:22:43,615 --> 00:22:44,604
进展怎么样？
How's it going?

361
00:22:44,783 --> 00:22:47,946
只要回答“无意见”，她就不能断章取义了
Just answer "no comment." That way she can't misquote you.

362
00:22:50,221 --> 00:22:53,122
- 你听说佛丽丝的事了么？ - 我刚去过医疗处
-You hear about Felice? -Yeah, I was just at the medical center.

363
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:57,318
她比保罗伤得更严重，正处于昏迷状态
She was stung way worse than Paul. She's in a coma.

364
00:22:58,029 --> 00:23:00,429
一周内两个候选人被攻击了
Two candidates attacked in a week.

365
00:23:00,598 --> 00:23:04,193
- 真是诡异的巧合 - 我觉得不是巧合吧
-It's a pretty freaky coincidence. -I think we've moved past coincidence.

366
00:23:04,469 --> 00:23:05,868
你觉得发生了什么？
What do you think's going on?

367
00:23:06,037 --> 00:23:09,734
记得去年萨莎被蜂群蜇伤的的意外吗？
Remember last year, Sasha's accident, when she was stung by a hive of bees?

368
00:23:10,241 --> 00:23:12,709
你觉得因为那次，她就能控制蜜蜂？
You think because of that, she's controlling them?

369
00:23:17,182 --> 00:23:18,171
只是个猜想
It's a theory.

370
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:21,751
这种猜想的思维跳跃度蛮大啊，不过我会调查下
Yeah, by several leaps and bounds, but I'll look into it.

371
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,378
这段时间，你也小心点
In the meantime, watch your back.

372
00:23:35,633 --> 00:23:37,601
我刚听说佛丽丝的事
I just heard about Felice.

373
00:23:37,769 --> 00:23:39,134
奇怪吧？
Weird, huh?

374
00:23:39,304 --> 00:23:41,397
这种事往往是有原因的
Sometimes things just happen for a reason.

375
00:23:41,573 --> 00:23:43,837
她可不像我这么在意这次选举
She didn't care about this election as much as me.

376
00:23:44,008 --> 00:23:46,909
我也不太喜欢她，但她也不该受这个苦
She wasn't my favorite person, but no one deserves that.

377
00:23:47,946 --> 00:23:50,710
好消息是，你不必继续竞选了
Well, the good news is, you don't have to run anymore.

378
00:23:50,882 --> 00:23:53,908
佛丽丝退出了，你最好让我选中
With Felice gone, the best thing you can do is let me run things.

379
00:23:54,085 --> 00:23:57,350
那么民主呢？大家有选择的权利
What about democracy? People should have freedom of choice.

380
00:23:57,522 --> 00:23:59,922
听着，克拉克，我真的很需要这个
Look, Clark, I really need this.

381
00:24:00,091 --> 00:24:02,491
我父母一定要让我赢，他们认为如果我输了…
My parents are riding me to win. They think if I lose...

382
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:06,323
…就不能去好大学 你有其他活动，但这次竞选是属于我的
...I won't get into a good college. You have other activities. This is my thing.

383
00:24:06,498 --> 00:24:08,989
- 你为什么不退出？ - 对不起
-Why don't you just drop out? -I'm sorry.

384
00:24:09,167 --> 00:24:12,364
我也有自己的原因想要赢
I have my own reasons to see this through.

385
00:24:12,537 --> 00:24:14,971
你犯了一个错误
You're making a mistake.

386
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,934
听起来像是威胁
That sounded like a threat.

387
00:24:19,644 --> 00:24:23,273
保罗和佛丽丝被蜜蜂攻击的事 难道你知道原因？
You wouldn't know how those bees wound up attacking Paul and Felice, would you?

388
00:24:23,448 --> 00:24:25,382
你是在指控我吗，克拉克？
Are you accusing me of something, Clark?

389
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:30,681
只是觉得蜂群攻击两个竞选候选人 这种事不太寻常
I find it interesting that a swarm of bees would attack two candidates in this election.

390
00:24:30,855 --> 00:24:33,881
我觉得背后有人在搞鬼
My thoughts are somebody's behind it.

391
00:24:47,772 --> 00:24:49,069
好的开始
Good start.

392
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,108
我的垃圾桶里有三份草稿 但还想不出可以像主席那样说些什么
My trash bin has three drafts in it. Nothing I can come up with sounds presidential.

393
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:55,974
不用像主席一样，只要说出你的信仰
You don't have to sound presidential. Say what you believe.

394
00:24:56,147 --> 00:25:00,379
- 写完这些，其余的就很简单了 - 那还是不太容易想啊
-Once you answer that, the rest is easy. -I've still got a lot of work to do, then.

395
00:25:00,552 --> 00:25:02,452
没我这么不容易吧
Not as much as I have here.

396
00:25:03,721 --> 00:25:07,589
我知道你处境艰难，但这已经做得很好了
I know you're having a tough time, but it's amazing what you've done with the place.

397
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:09,886
这只是个开始
This was just going to be the start.

398
00:25:10,061 --> 00:25:12,461
我的梦想是还原老剧院
My dream was to restore the old theater completely.

399
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:15,224
还原那些放映机，屏幕，放老电影
The projector, the screen. Show old movies.

400
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,766
千万不要放《教父》
<i>Just not The Godfather.</i>

401
00:25:19,037 --> 00:25:22,598
克拉克，快写演讲稿，必须要明确你的信仰
Come on, get back to the speech. You have to decide what you believe in.

402
00:25:23,608 --> 00:25:26,771
我相信我的朋友和他们的梦想
I believe in my friends and their dreams.

403
00:25:27,078 --> 00:25:29,638
如果他们的梦想破灭怎么办？
What if their dreams come crashing down around them?

404
00:25:29,814 --> 00:25:33,716
拉娜，只要有我在，什么都不会破灭
Nothing's crashing down around you, Lana, not while I'm here.

405
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:35,476
谢谢你，克拉克
Thanks, Clark.

406
00:25:38,723 --> 00:25:41,248
你听到了吗？
Did you hear that?

407
00:25:42,327 --> 00:25:45,319
恩，从那里传来
Yeah, it was coming from over there.

408
00:25:46,397 --> 00:25:48,524
还有那里
And there.

409
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,498
是什么?
What is it?

410
00:25:59,644 --> 00:26:02,408
快点！进去！
Come on! Get in!

411
00:26:03,748 --> 00:26:05,306
- 你呢？ - 趴下
-What about you? -Get down!

412
00:27:02,707 --> 00:27:04,971
不敢相信你没被蛰到
I still can't believe you didn't get stung.

413
00:27:05,143 --> 00:27:07,077
可能是我的皮厚
Guess I have tough skin.

414
00:27:07,245 --> 00:27:09,907
保险申请会比被蜜蜂蛰还惨
The insurance forms are gonna hurt worse than the stinger.

415
00:27:10,081 --> 00:27:12,208
不过我没事，多亏你
But I'm fine, thanks to you.

416
00:27:13,184 --> 00:27:15,015
妮尔来了
There's Nell.

417
00:27:15,186 --> 00:27:18,815
- 今晚我过得很开心 - 那以后要多经历些这种事
-I had a really nice time tonight. -Yeah, we should do this more often.

418
00:27:20,325 --> 00:27:24,159
- 你确定没事吗？ - 很遗憾，我们没能写你的演讲稿
-You sure you're okay? -Sorry we didn't get further on your speech.

419
00:27:24,329 --> 00:27:27,196
这是次要的事情，现在，我需要找到萨莎
That's the least of my worries. Right now, I need to find Sasha.

420
00:27:27,365 --> 00:27:29,196
- 你觉得是她做的 - 恩
-Do you think she did this? -Yes.

421
00:27:29,367 --> 00:27:31,665
只是不知道她怎么控制蜜蜂
I just don't know how she's controlling the bees.

422
00:27:31,836 --> 00:27:34,464
- 你需要打给克罗伊 - 我们还是不怎么说话
-You need to call Chloe. -We're still not really talking.

423
00:27:34,639 --> 00:27:36,732
你能相信吗？参选这事她不支持我
Can you believe she didn't endorse me?

424
00:27:36,908 --> 00:27:40,366
如果我在她的立场，可能也会这么做
Well, if I were in her position, I probably would have done the same thing.

425
00:27:40,545 --> 00:27:44,572
她只是客观地支持她觉得最有资格的人
She's just being objective. She endorsed the person she thought was most qualified.

426
00:27:44,749 --> 00:27:46,239
- 没错，但… - 克拉克…
-Yeah, but still-- -Clark...

427
00:27:46,417 --> 00:27:48,578
…你说过你相信你的朋友
...you said you believed in your friends.

428
00:27:48,753 --> 00:27:51,779
她只是做了她觉得正确的事情
She only did what she thought was right.

429
00:28:19,717 --> 00:28:20,706
克罗伊
Chloe.

430
00:28:20,885 --> 00:28:23,183
拉娜告诉我了塔龙发生的事 谢谢打电话来
Lana told me about the Talon. Thanks for the call.

431
00:28:23,354 --> 00:28:25,652
- 对不起 - 没关系，我不生气
-Sorry. -It's all right, I'm not mad.

432
00:28:26,758 --> 00:28:28,055
克罗伊…
Chloe...

433
00:28:29,994 --> 00:28:33,521
…关于你支持其他候选人的事，我不会放在心上
...I don't hold it against you. The endorsement, I mean.

434
00:28:33,698 --> 00:28:35,563
谢谢，我本应该警告你的
Thanks. I could've warned you, though.

435
00:28:37,035 --> 00:28:39,401
只是不喜欢跟你对立
I just don't like being in a fight with you.

436
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:42,733
我也不喜欢
Yeah, it wasn't my favorite part either.

437
00:28:44,275 --> 00:28:48,234
去年起，我的生活都开始改变了 包括我父母…
Everything has changed in my life in the last year, with my parents...

438
00:28:48,413 --> 00:28:50,643
…和拉娜
...with Lana.

439
00:28:51,916 --> 00:28:55,352
唯一没变的就是你，我很高兴，克罗伊
The only thing constant has been you. I'm glad for that, Chloe.

440
00:28:58,456 --> 00:28:59,980
我也是
Me too.

441
00:29:06,397 --> 00:29:08,456
感觉像蜂蜜
This feels like honey.

442
00:29:08,633 --> 00:29:11,466
蜂房里经常可以找到
Yeah, that's what you usually find in a hive.

443
00:29:13,604 --> 00:29:15,435
不要告诉我，这全是萨莎干的
Don't tell me Sasha did all this.

444
00:29:15,606 --> 00:29:17,801
不，是她的工蜂
No, her worker bees did.

445
00:29:17,975 --> 00:29:21,536
- 她怎么控制它们的？ - 我猜她散发了一种叫做…
-How is she controlling them? -I think she's emitting something called...

446
00:29:21,713 --> 00:29:24,511
…蜂后下颚信息素
...the queen mandibular pheromone.

447
00:29:24,682 --> 00:29:27,116
是她掉进蜂窝时得到的能力？
She pick that up when she fell in the hive?

448
00:29:27,285 --> 00:29:29,480
她被严重蛰伤
She was stung over a thousand times.

449
00:29:29,654 --> 00:29:33,954
那些是非洲蜜蜂 因为她过敏，医生们对她没抱希望
They were Africanized bees. Doctors didn't hold out hope, because she was allergic.

450
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:36,355
他们怎么解释她奇迹般的复原？
How do they account for the miracle recovery?

451
00:29:36,527 --> 00:29:38,290
他们不能，我也不能…
They don't. And neither could I...

452
00:29:38,463 --> 00:29:41,227
…直到我发现事故发生在舒斯特峡谷
...until I found out the accident happened in Shuster's Gorge.

453
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:44,800
- 那是镇上最深的火山口 - 恩，你做过陨石统计
-That's the deepest crater in town. -Yeah. You do the meteorite math.

454
00:29:44,969 --> 00:29:47,130
这些蜜蜂把她变成蜂后
The bees did something to make her their queen.

455
00:29:47,305 --> 00:29:49,466
全州的蜜蜂都听她的指挥
All the bees in the state are taking a cue from her.

456
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,904
它们正帮她把斯摩维尔中学变成蜂窝
They're helping her make Smallville High her hive.

457
00:29:52,076 --> 00:29:55,409
如果选举没按她的意愿，学校就有好看的了
If she doesn't like the way the vote goes, it won't be a pretty sight.

458
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,980
她也不会有好结果，蜜蜂只会忠心到一定程度
Neither will she. Bees are only loyal to a point.

459
00:29:58,149 --> 00:30:01,346
一旦她失去控制，她的气味就会改变 那些蜜蜂也会知道
Once she loses control, her scent will change, and the bees will know.

460
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:03,487
它们不会高兴的
They won't be happy.

461
00:30:10,261 --> 00:30:13,355
我以为你想找个私人的地方见面
Thought you wanted to meet somewhere private.

462
00:30:13,531 --> 00:30:16,967
这家店最近就挺“私人”的
Lately this has been passing for that.

463
00:30:18,503 --> 00:30:21,870
非常感谢你愿意来见我 我想多记下一些话
Thanks for agreeing to see me. I just want to get a few more quotes.

464
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:24,473
文章写得怎么样？
How's the article going?

465
00:30:24,642 --> 00:30:26,735
人们会对你刮目相看
People are gonna see you in a whole new light.

466
00:30:26,911 --> 00:30:28,811
是的，我确信他们会的
Yes, I bet they will.

467
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:32,245
- 我有幸读到初稿 - 你是如何得到的？
-I've had a chance to read the rough draft. -Where'd you get that?

468
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:36,284
我自有消息来源，这跟你的保证相差甚远
I have my sources. It's hardly the flattering expose you promised.

469
00:30:36,454 --> 00:30:39,685
- 它很公平和真实 - 你扭曲了我的原话
-It's fair and accurate. -You twisted everything I said.

470
00:30:39,857 --> 00:30:42,621
我的新闻学教授说过：“如果你想打败歌利亚…
My journalism professor says, "If you wanna bring down Goliath...

471
00:30:42,794 --> 00:30:45,922
…最好知道他的致命弱点" 你的弱点是你太自我
...you better know his Achilles heel." Yours is your ego.

472
00:30:47,365 --> 00:30:50,596
我发觉田纳西社区大学的都喜欢乱隐喻
I see they like to mix metaphors at East Tennessee Community College.

473
00:30:50,835 --> 00:30:53,963
因为你查了我的背景，我就该害怕吗？
Am I supposed to be scared because you ran a background check on me?

474
00:30:54,138 --> 00:30:57,107
- 我没有什么好隐瞒的 - 我父亲付了你多少钱？
-I have nothing to hide. -How much did my father pay you?

475
00:30:57,308 --> 00:31:00,368
- 你真是想多了 - 不然还有什么原因让你如此对我？
-You really are paranoid. -Why else would you sandbag me?

476
00:31:00,545 --> 00:31:03,446
我要坚持犀利的笔锋，并以此扬名
I plan on making a name for myself as a hard-hitting journalist...

477
00:31:03,614 --> 00:31:06,777
恰巧你是个非常显眼的目标
...and you're a very visible target.

478
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,418
多少钱你才肯撤掉这篇文章？
What's it gonna take to make this article go away?

479
00:31:11,589 --> 00:31:15,491
不同于你在询查报的走狗，我绝不出卖信仰
<i>Unlike your whore at the Inquisitor, I'm not for sale.</i>

480
00:31:17,762 --> 00:31:20,196
再见，莱克斯
Goodbye, Lex.

481
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,766
多谢你让我第一个开刀
Thanks for being my first.

482
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:50,423
你想见我？
You wanted to see me?

483
00:31:50,595 --> 00:31:52,927
我打算退出竞选
I've decided to drop out of the election.

484
00:31:53,097 --> 00:31:56,032
我想应该第一个告诉你
I thought you should be the first to know.

485
00:31:56,267 --> 00:32:00,067
很好，真高兴你终于想通了
Good. I'm glad you finally made the right decision.

486
00:32:00,238 --> 00:32:04,072
那群学生想给你们投票，只能说明…
The fact that those people even considered voting for any of you guys just proves...

487
00:32:04,242 --> 00:32:07,575
学校缺乏一个铁腕主席，那就是我
...that this school needs a strong leader. Now they'll have one.

488
00:32:07,745 --> 00:32:09,736
为了胜出，你还真是不择手段
You'll do anything to make sure that happens...

489
00:32:09,914 --> 00:32:13,372
甚至害你对手进医院
...including putting your opponents in the hospital.

490
00:32:15,586 --> 00:32:18,521
我看出来了，你根本没想退出
I see what this is. You haven't dropped out at all.

491
00:32:20,591 --> 00:32:22,889
- 我知道你是那些袭击的幕后主使 - 那又怎样
-I know you're behind the attacks. -So?

492
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:26,029
你又能怎样呢，克拉克？就算警方相信你
What are you going to do, Clark? Even if the police believe you...

493
00:32:26,197 --> 00:32:29,394
他们也无法阻止我，没人能
...they can't stop me. No one can.

494
00:32:30,935 --> 00:32:32,027
说不定我能
Try me.

495
00:32:33,137 --> 00:32:36,300
你是为了这个？所以才引我过来
That's what you want, isn't it? That's why you lured me here.

496
00:32:39,243 --> 00:32:41,677
你打算怎么办，克拉克？
What were you gonna do, Clark?

497
00:32:51,255 --> 00:32:53,382
你在干吗？
What are you doing?

498
00:32:53,658 --> 00:32:56,559
让你知道参政要做的牺牲
Teaching you that politics is all about sacrifice.

499
00:32:58,963 --> 00:33:00,430
你要召它们去哪里？
Where are you sending them?

500
00:33:00,598 --> 00:33:04,329
可能你皮糙肉厚，但你妈妈呢？
You may be thick-skinned, but what about your mother?

501
00:34:07,665 --> 00:34:10,259
- 妈，你还好吗？ - 没事，谢谢
-Mom, you okay? -Yeah, thanks.

502
00:34:10,434 --> 00:34:14,029
从未见过这么恐怖的蜜蜂袭击
I've never seen bees attack like that.

503
00:34:14,505 --> 00:34:17,167
你猜它们去哪了？
Where do you think they went?

504
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:30,917
你怎么进来的？你妈妈呢？
How'd you get here? What about your mom?

505
00:34:31,088 --> 00:34:33,454
我妈妈很好
My mom's fine.

506
00:34:33,624 --> 00:34:34,648
都结束了，萨莎
It's over, Sasha.

507
00:34:34,825 --> 00:34:37,191
还早呢，我还要作竞选演说
No, it's not. I still have a speech to make.

508
00:34:37,361 --> 00:34:40,694
你要敢阻止我，我就在礼堂人群之前…
If you try and stop me, I'll be in front of an auditorium full of people...

509
00:34:40,865 --> 00:34:43,493
- …你知道我会干什么 - 快停手吧
-...and you know what I can do to them. -You have to stop.

510
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:47,000
- 为竞选伤人不值得 - 我必须赢，克拉克
-No election is worth hurting people. -I have to win, Clark.

511
00:34:47,171 --> 00:34:50,800
我父母说，人只分两类：领袖和庸民
My parents said there are two kinds of people in the world: leaders and followers.

512
00:34:50,975 --> 00:34:53,273
他们期望我成为领袖，所以…
And they expect for me to be a leader. And that--

513
00:34:58,249 --> 00:35:01,150
- 快让蜜蜂停下 - 我没叫它们回来
-You have to stop the bees. -I didn't tell them to come back.

514
00:35:03,621 --> 00:35:05,316
怎么回事
Ow! What's happening?

515
00:35:05,923 --> 00:35:08,414
快帮帮我！我对蜜蜂过敏！
You have to help me! I'm allergic to bees!

516
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:11,589
别让它们蛰死我
Don't let them kill me!

517
00:36:11,355 --> 00:36:14,188
我送你去医院
Let's get you to a hospital.

518
00:36:19,588 --> 00:36:21,288
（热烈庆贺新任主席:陈保罗）

519
00:36:22,266 --> 00:36:24,908
难以置信，虽然佛丽丝和萨莎双双退出
I can't believe Felice and Sasha both dropped out and you still lost.

520
00:36:24,909 --> 00:36:26,293
可你还是输了

521
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:28,734
- 我哪儿做错了？ - 你组织得很棒
-Where did I go wrong? -You ran a good campaign.

522
00:36:28,906 --> 00:36:34,811
我们玩得嗨皮，交新朋友 得到的那些T恤一辈子穿不完
We had fun, met some new people, and we have enough T-shirts to last a lifetime.

523
00:36:35,146 --> 00:36:37,671
- 不是给火炬报拍的吧 - 是给保罗的
<i>-Please tell me that's not for the Torch. -It's for Paul.</i>

524
00:36:37,848 --> 00:36:43,013
他没法参加庆功宴，要我帮忙拍照
Since he couldn't attend his own victory party, he asked me to take pictures.

525
00:36:43,187 --> 00:36:47,021
克罗伊，你支持他是对的，他最具资质
Chloe, you were right to endorse him. He was the more qualified candidate...

526
00:36:47,191 --> 00:36:49,955
而我却只忙着拉票聚人气
...and I got caught up in the whole popularity rush.

527
00:36:50,127 --> 00:36:52,061
虽然你支持的人赢了，也别太得意
Don't gloat just because your guy won.

528
00:36:52,229 --> 00:36:54,789
赢了竞选输了朋友，又有何意义
Well, my candidate may have won, but my friend lost.

529
00:36:54,965 --> 00:36:57,627
- 今晚我真为你骄傲，克拉克 - 为什么？
-I'm really proud of you tonight, Clark. -Why?

530
00:36:57,801 --> 00:37:00,361
因为你看淡得失，败亦不馁
Because you're exhibiting dignity in the face of defeat.

531
00:37:00,538 --> 00:37:04,030
这是伟大领袖的必备素质
It's the quality that all great leaders possess.

532
00:37:08,979 --> 00:37:12,506
- 好热闹 - 以后常会这样的
-Nice crowd. -We'll be having more nights like this.

533
00:37:12,683 --> 00:37:14,275
为什么这么肯定？
How can you be so sure?

534
00:37:14,451 --> 00:37:17,784
这么说吧，我“上床了”
Let's just say I went to the mattresses.

535
00:37:18,289 --> 00:37:21,190
明天看报纸第三版
<i>Check out page three of the Ledger tomorrow.</i>

536
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:23,918
能提前透露一下吗？
Can you give me a preview?

537
00:37:24,094 --> 00:37:28,497
我得知，对手咖啡馆数次卫生违规
Apparently, a rival coffeehouse has had several health-department violations...

538
00:37:28,666 --> 00:37:31,430
- 而他们一直试图掩饰 - 你怎么知道的？
-...they've been trying to cover up. -How'd you hear about that?

539
00:37:31,702 --> 00:37:35,194
供货商告诉我的 克罗伊就请了一位记者朋友跟进
A vendor told me. So Chloe had a reporter friend look into it.

540
00:37:35,372 --> 00:37:38,398
结果传言属实
And sure enough, it's true.

541
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:42,140
很有手腕，实在佩服
Very creative. I'm impressed.

542
00:37:49,587 --> 00:37:52,750
竞选的事真遗憾
Hey, sorry about the election.

543
00:37:52,923 --> 00:37:56,324
我爸说成败得失皆学问
My father says you learn more about yourself when you lose.

544
00:37:56,493 --> 00:38:00,361
- 你学到了什么？ - 我不是搞政治的料
-What did you learn? -I'm not destined to be a politician.

545
00:38:00,831 --> 00:38:02,992
政客要有双重人格
You need two different personalities.

546
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:06,762
要改变世界未必要当官，克拉克
You don't need to be an elected official to change the world, Clark.

547
00:38:06,937 --> 00:38:10,668
- 你考虑过参政吗？ - 总有一天我要成为总统
-You ever thought about getting into politics? -Someday I'd like to be president.

548
00:38:11,475 --> 00:38:14,171
这样的话，那句口号得还你了
In that case, you can have your slogan back.

549
00:38:14,345 --> 00:38:16,609
没关系，你依然可以留着
It's okay, you can keep it.

550
00:38:24,121 --> 00:38:26,248
卡索小姐
Ms. Castle...

551
00:38:26,423 --> 00:38:28,357
多谢光临
...thank you for coming.

552
00:38:28,525 --> 00:38:32,461
虽然已有所闻，但我要亲耳听你说说
I should probably know better, but I had to hear this.

553
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:37,693
为了保护双方，不介意我录下谈话吧
You won't mind if I record our conversation, for both of our protection?

554
00:38:37,868 --> 00:38:39,199
请便
Feel free.

555
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:42,669
我请你来只是要恭喜你
I only asked you here to congratulate you.

556
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:46,004
说实话，我很折服
The truth is, I'm impressed.

557
00:38:46,176 --> 00:38:49,737
很少有人能抓我现行
Few people have caught me with my guard down.

558
00:38:50,347 --> 00:38:53,680
我猜猜，你要勒索我修改文章了吧
Let me guess. This is where you try and blackmail me to change my story?

559
00:38:53,851 --> 00:38:57,150
我可不敢勒索你或要你改口
I wouldn't dream of blackmailing you or making you change a word.

560
00:38:57,554 --> 00:39:01,217
我爸常说，无人议论之日，气数已尽之时
My father says it's when they stop talking about you that you should worry.

561
00:39:01,392 --> 00:39:03,986
- 那我们没什么谈的了 - 不过话说回来
-Then I guess we're settled. -On the other hand...

562
00:39:04,161 --> 00:39:08,120
你们报社总监位子近来出现空缺
<i>...it turns out there's an opening for managing editor at the Journal.</i>

563
00:39:10,801 --> 00:39:12,393
我在那里工作
I work there.

564
00:39:12,569 --> 00:39:17,029
- 如果有空缺，我肯定知道 - 我们认识的人不同
-lf there was an opening, I would know. -We don't know the same people.

565
00:39:17,207 --> 00:39:21,166
你可以继续激浊扬清，保持犀利的笔锋
You could run your fair and balanced article word-for-word if you'd like.

566
00:39:21,345 --> 00:39:24,644
也可以迈步走向总编办公室
Or you could show up to work tomorrow and walk into a corner office.

567
00:39:24,815 --> 00:39:27,613
- 你想选择哪个？ - 有什么条件？
-The choice is yours. -What's the catch?

568
00:39:27,785 --> 00:39:30,515
没有，或许有一个
No catch. Well, maybe one.

569
00:39:30,688 --> 00:39:35,022
如果再有人勒索你，你就有所忌讳了
If someone ever tries to blackmail you, now you'll have something to hide.

570
00:39:36,493 --> 00:39:39,656
真不知道你们父子俩哪个更毒
I don't know if you're better or worse than your father.

571
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:42,298
他发现你毙稿子的时候，会怎么说？
What will you say when he sees you killed the article?

572
00:39:42,466 --> 00:39:45,458
- 谁说是他主使的？ - 省省吧，卡索女士
-Who says he's behind it? -Please, Ms. Castle...

573
00:39:45,636 --> 00:39:49,868
我没侮辱你的智商，你也别侮辱我的
...l've never insulted your intelligence, don't insult mine.

574
00:39:51,075 --> 00:39:55,011
我会说，不是我不做，是另有诱惑难以拒绝
I'll tell him I got an offer I couldn't refuse.

575
00:40:15,799 --> 00:40:17,858
竞选总部撤掉啦？
Packing up campaign headquarters?

576
00:40:18,035 --> 00:40:19,935
是啊，变回谷仓了
Yeah, it's back to just being a barn.

577
00:40:20,104 --> 00:40:22,664
抱歉在塔龙没说上话，人太多了
Sorry we couldn't talk more at the Talon. It was packed.

578
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,274
那样挺好
It looked better that way.

579
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:30,502
- 我觉得挺好 - 只是…
-I'd assume that was a good thing. -It is. It's just....

580
00:40:30,681 --> 00:40:33,912
我有点后悔对那家店使阴招
I'm not sure I liked what I did, playing dirty with the Beanery.

581
00:40:34,084 --> 00:40:35,949
或许耍手段不是你的性格
Maybe the mattress isn't for you.

582
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:39,180
不成功便成仁，我必须做出选择
I had to choose between doing the right thing and being successful.

583
00:40:39,356 --> 00:40:42,689
奇怪的是，使卑鄙手段我还挺开心
The weird part is, I kind of enjoyed being underhanded.

584
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:47,092
拉娜・郎堕入黑暗面？谁曾想到呢？
Lana Lang seduced by the dark side? Who would've thunk?

585
00:40:48,699 --> 00:40:51,429
别担心，咱都未能幸免
Don't worry, we all get caught up.

586
00:40:51,668 --> 00:40:56,128
我一心追求人气，连竞选的本意都忘了
I got so caught up in the popularity thing I almost forgot why I ran.

587
00:40:58,475 --> 00:41:01,239
写演讲稿了吗？
Did you ever finish your speech?

588
00:41:01,578 --> 00:41:04,308
写完了，但没人会听了
Yeah. Not that anyone will ever hear it.

589
00:41:04,915 --> 00:41:07,315
- 我要听 - 什么时候？
-I could hear it. -Yeah? When?

590
00:41:07,718 --> 00:41:09,879
就现在
Now.

591
00:41:10,687 --> 00:41:13,019
- 现在？ - 是啊
-Right now? -Yes, Clark.

592
00:41:15,125 --> 00:41:18,288
演讲！演讲！演讲！
Speech, speech, speech!

593
00:41:32,276 --> 00:41:36,144
大家认为班级主席都无所作为，我不认同
Nobody thinks that a class president can make a difference, but I disagree.

594
00:41:36,313 --> 00:41:39,339
如果想改变世界，需要从我做起
If we want to change the world, first we have to change ourselves.

595
00:41:39,516 --> 00:41:42,883
我父亲常说，成败得失皆学问
My father always says that you learn life lessons whether you win or lose...

596
00:41:43,053 --> 00:41:47,387
所以，希望尊敬的竞选伙伴能够与我携手…
...so I hope that my worthy running mates will work alongside me....
