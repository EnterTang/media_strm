故事:格雷格・沃克
I did not need to see that.

76
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,855
我不需要看到这场景

77
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:56,588
嘿，儿子，这是旧式对英雄的欢迎仪式 明白我的意思不？
Hey, son. Just getting the old hero's welcome, you know what I mean?

78
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:58,129
爸爸是怎么了？
What's going on with Dad?

79

Hey, Clark, football game on TV. You want to watch it with me?

82
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,741
你不是还有活要干吗？
Don't you have work to do?

83
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:11,640
那些活先推后
Chores can wait.

84
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,575
况且--哇!
Besides-- Whoa!

85
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:17,274
我有权休息，反正你可以帮我干活，不是吗？
I earned a rest. You can pick up the slack for me, can't you?

86
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:21,152
强纳森
Jonathan.

87
00:05:21,956 --> 00:05:25,289
很高兴这场英雄事迹 没有冲昏你头脑
It's good to see this whole hero thing didn't go to your head.

88
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:29,362
- 但愿我没有唐突 - 嗨，莱克斯，进来吧
-Hope I'm not interrupting. -Hi, Lex. Come in.

89
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,191
有什么事，莱克斯？
What's up, Lex?

90
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:35,695
- 我是来找肯特先生的 - 你想干啥？
-I'm looking for Mr. Kent. -What do you want?

91
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,871
我听说你在车祸中救了我的一个雇员 我来看看你是否安好
I heard you pulled my employee out of a car, I wanted to see if you were okay.

92
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,874
才不是呢，你是想打探我是不是要告你
No, you didn't. You wanted to see if I was gonna sue you or not.

93
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:47,138
这样我就可以结束财务危机了，对吧？
That would put an end to all my financial difficulty, wouldn't it?

94
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:50,078
- 强纳森，够了 - 不，还不够，玛莎
-Jonathan, that's enough. -No, it's not enough, Martha.

You see, I don't like Lex Luthor...

96
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:55,777
我不喜欢莱诺・卢瑟 我也不喜欢你和我儿子做朋友
...I don't like Lionel Luthor, and I don't like your friendship with my son.

97
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:59,483
说实话，要是你们卢瑟家的人都死光光 我眼泪都不会掉一滴
In fact, if all of you Luthors were to dry up and die, I wouldn't shed a tear.

98
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,491
爸爸，够了
Dad, that's enough.

99
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:09,866
我去睡一会儿
I think I'll take a nap.

100
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:20,507
莱克斯…
Lex....

101
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:30,684
哇，喝啤酒，发牢骚 和你妈妈在橱柜上亲热？
Wow. Drinking beer, mouthing off and counter-macking with your mom?

102
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:34,055
祝贺你，克拉克，你老爸重返青春期了
Congratulations, Clark, your dad's regressed back to being a teenager.

103
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:37,527
他最近压力很大，我担心他是不是要崩溃了
He's been under a lot of stress, but I wonder if he's beginning to crack.

104
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:39,689
谁会一下午睡三个小时？
Who takes a three-hour nap in the afternoon?

105
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:42,631
不知道，但我还是暗爽他呛了莱克斯那通
I don't know, but I still like the part where he dissed Lex.

106
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:44,464
为什么？你和莱克斯有什么过节？
Why? What do you have against Lex?

107
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:47,573
我来数数，他把我家人踢出奶油玉米厂
Let's see. He screwed my family out of the creamed-corn factory.

108
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,175
那是12年前，不是他，是他父亲干的
Well, that was 12 years ago. And it was his father.

109
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:53,404
- 反正我不喜欢他 - 那你怎么从来没说过？
-I've never been crazy about him. -Why haven't you said something?

110
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,514
我本希望你能看清他的邪恶本性呢
I was hoping you'd see he was bad news.

111
00:06:55,683 --> 00:06:57,014
你们心中最深处的欲望是什么？
What's your deepest desire?

112
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:59,516
如果没有任何约束，你会想做什么？
If nothing was holding you back, what would you do?

113
00:06:59,687 --> 00:07:02,417
嗨，克罗伊，也很高兴见到你，咋了？
Hello, Chloe, nice to see you too. What's up?

114
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:06,286
关校长认为我应该紧紧把握学生脉搏
Principal Kwan thinks I need to get in touch with the pulse of the student body.

115
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:10,920
所以我决定做个调查 你俩得回应我的问卷
So I've decided to do a poll. Now, if you would both please do your statistical duty.

116
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,362
我会马上去和那个女孩亲热
I'd go over and make out with that girl right now.

117
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:17,800
我目前收到的答案都与性或暴力相关
You know, every answer I've gotten so far has been either sex- or violence-related.

118
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:21,634
这是人类的本性，克罗伊，再见
That's human nature, Chloe. Later.

119
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:25,236
嗨
Hi.

120
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:29,246
你知道皮特不喜欢莱克斯吗？
Did you know that Pete doesn't like Lex?

121
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:32,010
知道，他绝对嫉妒你和莱克斯的友谊
Yeah, he's totally jealous of your friendship with him.

122
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:34,381
他觉得他和你的关系不像以前那么亲密了
He feels you aren't as close as you used to be.

123
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:35,544
嘿
Hey.

124
00:07:35,723 --> 00:07:37,953
嗨
Hi.

125
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,500
（你最深的欲望是什么？）
What about you, Lana? Got one?

126
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:40,958
你呢，拉娜？什么想法？

127
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:44,653
我会爬上钱德勒农场的风车
I would climb the windmill out in Chandler's field.

128
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:47,892
真的？那就是你最深层次的欲望？
Really? That's your deepest desire.

129
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:50,832
有人告诉我从那里可以看到大都会的地平线
Somebody told me you could see the Metropolis skyline from there.

130
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:53,666
我一直没胆量自己去爬
I haven't got the guts to climb up and see for myself.

131
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,673
好吧
Okay.

132
00:07:56,844 --> 00:08:00,177
- 我也可以编个别的答案 - 不用，挺好的，我喜欢
-I can always make something up. -No, it's good. It's good, I like it.

133
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:03,783
这就是无拘无束的拉娜内心
It's unleashing the inner Lana.

134
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,181
好吧
Okay.

135
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:12,982
行了，克拉克，该你了
Okay, Clark, you're up.

136
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:18,087
克拉克，注意啊，这调查分级属于PG-13
Clark. Remember, it's a PG-13 poll.

137
00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:23,362
自从惠特尼的爸爸住院以来 拉娜周围就存在禁飞区了
Since Whitney's dad has been in the hospital, there's been a no-fly zone over Lana.

138
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:29,169
你该知道，还有别的女孩呢 不需要你穿越雷区就能得到的
You know, there are other girls out there that don't require crossing an emotional minefield.

139
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:33,344
但是又没有开关让我直接把对她的感情关掉
But I can't just turn off my feelings for her.

140
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:35,539
选择权在你手里
You know, the choice is yours.

141
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:40,779
要么坐在阁楼里玩你的望远镜，要么向前看
You can either sit in your loft and play with your telescope, or move on.

142
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,798
- 嗨 - 嗨
-Hi. -Hi.

143
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:59,769
咱俩一起去干草棚乐呵乐呵怎么样？
What do you say you and I go up into the hayloft and have us a little fun, huh?

144
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,536
现在不行，这边的活得有人干
Not now. Somebody's gotta do some work around here.

145
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:08,442
或许你该打电话给莱克斯道个歉
Maybe you would like to call Lex Luthor and apologize.

146
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:11,083
凭啥？我跟他说的都是实话
Why? All I did was tell him the truth.

147
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:15,187
我知道我说过应该释放你的感情 但是你现在做得太过火了
I know I said you should let your feelings out, but you're taking this too far.

148
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,289
你怎么了？
What's wrong with you?

149
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:18,948
没事
Nothing.

150
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:23,119
- 我觉得很自由 - 你看起来不怎么好
-I feel free. -Well, you don't look well.

151
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:27,165
你发烧了，要不躺一下吧 我回来给你做点汤
You're burning up. Why don't you go back to bed. I'll make you soup when I get back.

152
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:29,097
嘿
Hey.

153
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:35,570
- 我知道个治疗发烧的好办法 - 亲爱的，我真得走了
-I know a much better way to break a fever. -Sweetheart, I have to go, really.

154
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:45,985
<i>肯特家，请留言</i>
<i>This is the Kents, leave a message.</i>

155
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:48,246
<i>强纳森，我是银行的吉姆・亚历山大</i>
<i>Jonathan, it's Jim Alexander over at the bank.</i>

156
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:52,791
<i>我直说吧，我们恐怕得拒绝你的贷款申请</i>
<i>I'm gonna be straight with you. I'm afraid we're going to have to turn down your loan.</i>

157
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:56,060
喂，吉姆？给我听着
Hello, Jim? Yeah, listen to me.

158
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,721
我一直在给社区做贡献
I have done nothing but give back to this community...

159
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:01,561
而大家对我的回报仅仅是跟我过不去
...and all anyone has ever done for me is screw me over.

160
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:03,532
我这就去银行
So I'm gonna come down to that bank...

161
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:07,071
看你敢不敢当着我的面拒绝我的贷款
...and you are going to have to turn my loan down right to my face.

162
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:12,178
我倒要看看你是不是真的有种 还是被你老婆给藏起来了
That way I can see whether you have a pair or whether your wife keeps them in a drawer.

163
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:28,054
会不会开车，混蛋？
Where did you learn to drive, you jerk?

164
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:35,223
慢点！
Slow down!

165
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:40,537
爸爸，你干什么呢？
Dad, what are you doing?

166
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:43,767
我一直给社区做贡献，但是他们都跟我过不去
I've done nothing but give to this town, and they screw me over.

167
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:46,105
他们欺人太甚，我要反击了
They've pushed me too far, and I'm pushing back.

168
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,304
不能拿着把猎枪去啊
Not with a shotgun.

169
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:50,939
- 你别冲动，你没考虑清楚 - 我想得可清楚了，儿子
-You gotta slow down. You're not thinking. -I'm thinking just fine, son.

170
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:52,346
别挡道！
Now get out of my way!

171
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:06,696
克拉克
Clark.

172
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:20,535
爸爸
Dad.

173
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:23,040
爸爸
Dad.

174
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:27,086
他的症状是严重的过敏性休克
His symptoms indicate a severe anaphylactic shock.

175
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:30,246
- 但是检测不出任何已知抗原 - 那会是什么呢？
-But we can't detect any known antigens. -What is it then?

176
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:34,417
要是他昨天进来，我就会说这种症状前所未见
Truth is, if he'd come in just yesterday, I'd say I'd never seen anything like it.

177
00:11:34,595 --> 00:11:37,689
但是我们今早收治了一个出车祸的人 叫詹姆斯・比尔斯
But we admitted a car-crash victim this morning, a James Beels?

178
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,456
他俩的症状一模一样
Showed identical symptoms.

179
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:42,158
就是爸爸救下的那人，他怎么样了？
That's the guy Dad saved. How's he doing?

180
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:45,903
不妙
Not good.

181
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:48,633
一小时前陷入昏迷了
He fell into a coma an hour ago.

182
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:05,184
咱们来干什么？
Okay, so, what are we doing out here?

183
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:10,092
肯特先生和比尔斯先生显示出相同的症状 这是他俩唯一在一起呆过的地方
Mr. Kent and Mr. Beels both have the same symptoms. This is the only place they've...

184
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:14,256
所以应该是这里的某物造成的
...been together, so I think what happened to Mr. Kent was caused by something here.

185
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:16,527
- 我们要找什么呢？ - 任何东西都有可能
-What are we looking for? -Anything.

186
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:20,833
哇，残骸从那边一直延伸到这沟里
Wow. The debris starts from way over there and ends over in that ditch.

187
00:12:21,008 --> 00:12:23,909
这人开车真够冲的
That's some serious road rage.

188
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:50,536
我可能找到了什么
I think I found something.

189
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:15,987
发现什么了？
What you got?

190
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,130
对不起
Sorry.

191
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:24,429
没关系，咱们走吧，找不到什么线索
That's all right. Let's get out of here. This place is a dead end.

192
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:44,418
祝你健康
Gesundheit.

193
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:50,494
你没有对我完全说实话，哈密尔顿博士
Seems you haven't been completely honest with me, Dr. Hamilton.

194
00:13:52,099 --> 00:13:55,193
我跟你说了，情况可控
I told you, it's under control.

195
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:57,302
两个人染上不明病症
Two men with an unexplained illness...

196
00:13:57,471 --> 00:14:01,066
而没有人知道该怎么医治 这可不像是情况可控
...for which no one seems to know the cure isn't my idea of under control.

197
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:05,473
我对你擅自进行的植物学实验进行了一些了解
I did a little research of my own into your unauthorized botany experiment.

198
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:12,317
显然，1871年一种奇怪的传染病 席卷了摩尔利定居点
Apparently, in 1871 a strange contagion struck the Morley settlement...

199
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:14,886
一夜之间死了200人
...and 200 people died almost overnight.

200
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:17,387
一个传教士目睹了这一切并在日记中留下记录
A priest who witnessed the scene left a diary.

201
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:21,254
他的最后一条记录描述了人们举止异常
His last entries describe how the settlers began acting out of character.

202
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:24,659
他声称这是由当地的一种花导致的
He claimed a local flower was to blame.

203
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:29,165
"在上帝的绿色地球上，这种花是圣堂的盗贼
"On God's green earth, this flower was the thief in the temple.

204
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:33,602
沉默的妖魅，只需一个喷嚏 就将我们最深的欲望…
The silent temptress that, with a single sneeze, brought out the basest instincts...

205
00:14:33,774 --> 00:14:36,242
挖掘出来，使人陷入暴力"
...in men and drove them to violence."

206
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:39,435
科学界仅仅将此视为民间传说
That's been relegated to folklore in scientific circles.

207
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:48,181
要是你不相信这种说法 那你就不介意我解开罩子闻一闻这朵花咯？
If you don't believe in this, you won't mind if I lift the lid and smell the flower?

208
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:50,782
你为什么要把它复活？
Why'd you bring it back?

209
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:54,222
这种花的毒素据说除了致命…
These flowers were believed to have toxins that, while deadly...

210
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,453
还有其它用途
...might have other applications.

211
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,098
我划提供资金不是为了让你养宠物
I'm not here to bankroll your pet projects.

212
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:00,961
我只对陨石感兴趣
I'm only interested in the meteors.

213
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:03,193
你想知道它们能做什么
You wanted to know what they could do.

214
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,429
我没打算因此把人送进医院
Putting people in the hospital wasn't the plan.

215
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:07,470
所有的发现都会有其后果
Every discovery has their consequences.

216
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:12,169
如果强纳森・肯特死了 你会失去的就不仅仅是你的职位了
If Jonathan Kent dies, you're gonna lose something more valuable than your tenure.

217
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:15,974
把你的花装好 我在大都会有一队科学家准备研究它
Pack up a flower. I've got a team of specialists in Metropolis to work on it.

218
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,314
- 这是我的研究 - 我才不在乎你的研究呢
-It's my research. -I don't give a damn about your research.

219
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,784
我只想找到治疗方法
I just want to find a cure.

220
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:57,051
哇
Wow.

221
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:00,617
为什么要穿成这样？
What's the occasion?

222
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:06,061
没什么，我只想咱们今天应该翘课
Nothing. I just thought we'd blow off class today.

223
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:07,257
我…
I....

224
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:08,958
我不能
I can't.

225
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:12,104
我勉强才跟上功课，我还得去商店
I'm barely keeping ahead, and I gotta go to the store...

226
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:14,399
然后去医院看我爸
...and then run by the hospital and see my dad.

227
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:17,407
你知道吗？我对你的借口已经厌倦了
You know what? I am tired of your excuses.

228
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:23,447
自从你爸病了，你就变得索然寡味
Ever since your dad got sick, you haven't been any fun at all.

229
00:16:23,617 --> 00:16:25,744
对不起，拉娜，但这事马虎不得
I'm sorry, Lana, but it's kind of a big deal.

230
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:29,150
随便吧，我觉得我是出于愧疚 才被困在这种恋爱关系里的
Whatever. I feel like I'm locked in this relationship out of guilt.

231
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:32,519
拉娜，你怎么了？
Lana. What's wrong with you?

232
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:36,388
没怎么，我只是想坦白说出来
Nothing. I'm just not keeping it inside anymore.

233
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:39,555
如果你真这么想 或许咱们该重新审视咱俩的关系了
If that's how you feel, maybe we need to reconsider this relationship.

234
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,693
好吧
Okay, fine.

235
00:16:43,904 --> 00:16:46,065
咱俩分手，惠特尼
It's over, Whitney.

236
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:53,440
- 嘿，吉米 - 哦，拉娜
-Hey, Jimmy. -Oh, Lana.

237
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:56,081
真棒
Nice.

238
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:04,655
不去上课吗，克拉克？
Not going to class, Clark?

239
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:07,793
我真没什么心情…去上课
I'm not really up...to it.

240
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:15,995
怎么了？
What's the matter?

241
00:17:17,671 --> 00:17:21,038
没什么，你换了种打扮
Nothing. It's just a change.

242
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:26,177
你喜欢吗？
You like it?

243
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:31,214
我觉得更贴切的词是"唉呀妈呀"
I think the operative word is "gulp."

244
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:35,981
听着
Listen.

245
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:39,947
我知道事情不顺，但是你不能让这些拖垮你
I know things are rough, but you can't let them get you down.

246
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:44,858
这可不容易
It's kind of hard not to.

247
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:50,333
诀窍在于不去想它
The key is to keep your mind off it.

248
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:52,937
让你的朋友好好帮你
Let your friends be your friends.

249
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,035
让他们帮你分散注意
Let them distract you.

250
00:17:57,544 --> 00:17:59,876
信任他们
Trust them.

251
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:04,150
我当然信任你，拉娜
I do trust you, Lana.

252
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,515
很好
Good.

253
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:11,120
那就跟我来
Then follow me.

254
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:23,066
咱们在这里干什么？
What are we doing in here?

255
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:24,828
这里好安静
It's quiet.

256
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:27,968
而且这么做完全…
It's also completely...

257
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,572
是被禁止的
...off-limits.

258
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:37,783
拉娜，我不觉得我想这么做
Lana, I don't think I'm really up for this.

259
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,617
你想得太多了，克拉克
You think too much, Clark.

260
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:54,823
我觉得你这会儿的表现不太像你自己
Right now I'm thinking you don't seem like yourself.

261
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:57,195
又或者…
Or maybe...

262
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,205
我比任何时候都更像我自己
...l'm more me than ever.

263
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:09,181
拉娜，这太疯狂了
Lana, this is crazy.

264
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:10,873
要的就是疯狂
That's the point.

265
00:19:11,051 --> 00:19:16,717
要是生活不能让你疯狂，还活着干嘛？
If life doesn't make you crazy, then why bother living it?

266
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,983
我知道我想要这样
I know that's how I want it.

267
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:34,632
问题是
Question is:

268
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:36,707
你和我想要的一样吗？
Do you want what I want?

269
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:55,888
拉娜!
Lana!

270
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:57,654
你不想下来吗，克拉克？
Don't you want to come in, Clark?

271
00:19:57,831 --> 00:20:00,299
我不太想
I don't think so.

272
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:18,007
我知道你想得到我，克拉克
I know you want me, Clark.

273
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:22,745
别再藏着掖着了，来吧
Just stop holding back. Come on.

274
00:20:23,156 --> 00:20:27,559
你又不是钢铁之躯，或许你是的？
You're not made of steel. Or are you?

275
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,070
等等
Wait.

276
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:48,406
你还没等够吗？
Aren't you tired of waiting?

277
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:52,448
需要我帮你来个热身？
Need a little help warming up?

278
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:10,600
光彩照人的拉娜・郎在你面前就脱衣服了
She just stripped down in front of you. Lana Lang, in all her glory.

279
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,261
大部分时候是，但关校长不这么看
Most of her glory. Not that Kwan saw it.

280
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:17,205
至少你周六留校的时候 可以有好题材做白日梦了
Well, at least you'll have a nice picture to daydream about in Saturday detention.

281
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:19,140
很诡异，她说了所有我想听的话
She said everything I wanted to hear...

282
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:21,473
但是她自己好像没意识到她在做什么
...but it didn't seem like she knew what she was doing.

283
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:23,673
你觉得什么原因让拉娜变得轻佻了？
What do you think made Lana go soft-core?

284
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:25,846
先是我爸，接着是拉娜
First my dad, now Lana.

285
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:29,580
是啊，别忘了还有那个叫比尔斯的 记得你爸救下的那人不？
Yeah, and don't forget that Beels guy. Remember the one that your dad helped?

286
00:21:29,756 --> 00:21:32,418
你们在事故现场一定遗漏了什么
You must have missed something at the accident site.

287
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:35,083
不，没有，我也去了那里，可我好好的
No, I didn't. Because I was there and I'm fine.

288
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:37,661
这真是说不通
It just doesn't make any sense.

289
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:45,461
等一下，看起来不只是我们在那里
Wait. Looks like we weren't the only ones out there.

290
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,162
那是谁？
Who's that?

291
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,171
我想这是哈密尔顿博士
I think it's Dr. Hamilton.

292
00:21:49,342 --> 00:21:50,832
- 那个陨石狂人？ - 对
-The meteor freak? -Yeah.

293
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,274
他在树林里偷偷摸摸干嘛呢？
What's he doing skulking around in the woods?

294
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:56,973
我不知道，但是我觉得这不是巧合
I don't know, but I have a feeling it's not just a coincidence.

295
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,311
- 我去和他谈谈 - 我去找拉娜谈谈
-I'm gonna go talk to him. -I'm gonna go talk to Lana.

296
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:04,013
我觉得她和我爸爸有相同的遭遇
I think whatever happened to my father is about to happen to her.

297
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:09,622
我要的是比“进展”更有用的东西
I want something better than progress.

298
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:12,924
我刚才在医院，他们的情况恶化了
I was just at the hospital, they're getting worse.

299
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:18,426
拉娜，你去哪了？ 莫妮卡请病假了，我们缺人顶班
Where have you been? Monique called in sick, and we haven't got anyone to cover.

300
00:22:18,605 --> 00:22:19,833
这关我什么事？
Why is this my problem?

301
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:23,407
因为妮尔去大都会了，你是助理经理
Because Nell's in Metropolis and you're the assistant manager.

302
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:27,012
我今天下午要放假，看来只有提前关门了
Well, I'm taking the afternoon off, so I guess we're closing early.

303
00:22:29,983 --> 00:22:35,615
大伙听着，我们提前关门 咖啡不用付钱了，赶紧喝掉
Listen up. We're closing early, so coffee's on the house. Drink up.

304
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:40,217
我会回电的
I'll call back.

305
00:22:49,836 --> 00:22:51,463
拉娜
Lana.

306
00:22:51,638 --> 00:22:53,572
塔龙9点才关门
The Talon closes at 9.

307
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:57,602
今天例外
Not today.

308
00:22:57,777 --> 00:23:00,541
你这态度可不好，拉娜
You're not impressing anyone with the attitude, Lana.

309
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:03,614
你这叛逆青年是在跟你老板打交道呢
You're talking to someone who set the bar for adolescent rebellion.

310
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:09,346
没错，我听说你来斯摩维尔前是个坏小子
That's right. I heard you were quite the bad boy before you joined us here in Smallville.

311
00:23:09,522 --> 00:23:10,750
我并不以此为傲
It's nothing I'm proud of.

312
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:15,019
算了吧，你并不关心塔龙
Please. You don't really care about the Talon.

313
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:18,186
你投资它只是因为我请求你
You only invested because I asked you to.

314
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,895
你为什么要这么做？
Now, why would you go and do a thing like that?

315
00:23:27,707 --> 00:23:30,540
卢瑟家向来以隐蔽的动机出名
The Luthors are famous for their ulterior motives.

316
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:34,646
所以告诉我，莱克斯，你真的是关心利润吗？
So tell me, Lex, was it really about profit?

317
00:23:41,521 --> 00:23:47,153
我不确定你在干什么，但这不是你 拉娜，你是不是哪里不太对劲？
I'm not sure what this is, but it isn't you, Lana. Are you feeling okay?

318
00:23:49,062 --> 00:23:51,189
事实上
Actually....

319
00:23:52,532 --> 00:23:53,999
我有点紧张
I'm a little nervous.

320
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:58,263
我可能需要些指导，你知道…
I might need some guidance, you know...

321
00:23:58,905 --> 00:24:04,207
来自某个比较有经验的人的指导
...from someone with a little more experience.

322
00:24:05,812 --> 00:24:08,144
你觉得如何，老板？
What do you say, boss?

323
00:24:12,218 --> 00:24:16,621
拉娜，你过去24小时去过哪里？
Lana, where have you been in the last 24 hours?

324
00:24:17,056 --> 00:24:19,286
不关你的事
It's none of your business.

325
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:21,154
你有啥看不惯？
What's your problem?

326
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:22,351
这不是你
This isn't you.

327
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:25,429
为什么，因为我没有按吩咐办事？
Why, because I'm not doing exactly as I'm told?

328
00:24:25,598 --> 00:24:27,998
因为我没有坐在角落里藏在书后面？
Because I'm not sitting in a corner hiding in a book?

329
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:30,897
我终于对生活不再恐惧，结果没人能接受
For once I'm not scared of life, and no one can handle it...

330
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,538
因为你们更喜欢那个缺乏安全感的小女孩
...because you all prefer the insecure little girl.

331
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:39,008
我受够她了，她只会谈论自己死去的双亲
Well, I'm sick of her and all her talk about her dead parents.

332
00:24:59,432 --> 00:25:01,627
拉娜!
Lana!

333
00:25:09,776 --> 00:25:13,075
哈密尔顿博士，你好 我是斯摩维尔火炬报的克罗伊・苏利文
<i>Dr. Hamilton, hello. Chloe Sullivan, Smallville Torch.</i>

334
00:25:13,246 --> 00:25:15,043
咱们在网上讨论过陨石的
We spoke on the Internet about the meteors?

335
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:16,203
克罗伊
Chloe.

336
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:19,645
你能告诉我昨晚你在树林做什么吗？
Can you tell me what you were doing in the woods last night?

337
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,654
和我平常去树林所做的事一样
What I do there most nights.

338
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:26,258
搜寻陨石样本 我觉得用手电光更容易发现它们
Search for meteor samples. I find it easier to spot them with flashlights.

339
00:25:26,426 --> 00:25:28,417
那么你没看见我和我的朋友了
So you didn't see me and my friend.

340
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:32,223
我听到了说话声，看到了手电的光亮 我知道孩子们喜欢聚会
I heard voices, I saw flashlights, I know that kids like to party...

341
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:34,559
你也知道，我不喜欢人多
...and as you know, I don't like company.

342
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:37,897
- 你不是在检查车祸现场？ - 什么车祸？
-You weren't looking at the accident scene? -What accident?

343
00:25:39,397 --> 00:25:40,597
《尼哥底母日记》

344
00:25:41,908 --> 00:25:46,140
我肯定是搞错了，抱歉打扰你了
I must be mistaken. Sorry to have bothered you.

345
00:25:46,312 --> 00:25:49,543
你们昨晚在树林干嘛呢？
And what were you doing in the woods last night?

346
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:52,206
和朋友聚会
Partying with my friends.

347
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:22,937
拉娜，发生什么事了？ 莱克斯知道你开了他的车吗？
Lana, what's going on? Does Lex know you have his car?

348
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:26,749
这会应该知道了
He should by now.

349
00:26:27,987 --> 00:26:30,251
你被什么东西影响了，我只是不知道是什么
Something happened to you, I just don't know what.

350
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:35,690
这叫自信，我终于不再压抑我的感情，我自由了
It's called self-confidence. For the first time, I'm not repressing my feelings. I'm free.

351
00:26:35,862 --> 00:26:36,886
不，不是这样
No, you're not.

352
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:41,197
你还说呢，我在你面前跳入泳池 你都没敢冒一把险
You should talk. You had me in the pool, and you didn't take your chance.

353
00:26:41,367 --> 00:26:44,302
我懂你看我的眼神 为什么你就是不肯告诉我你的感受？
I see the way you look at me. Why don't you tell me how you feel?

354
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,802
拉娜，你病了，我得送你去医院
Lana, you're sick. I need to get you to a hospital.

355
00:26:46,973 --> 00:26:49,908
别转移话题，克拉克
Don't avoid the question, Clark.

356
00:26:50,076 --> 00:26:52,476
你是不是爱上我了？
Are you in love with me?

357
00:26:53,746 --> 00:26:54,735
拉娜…
Lana....

358
00:26:54,914 --> 00:26:58,179
真是个懦夫，这么简单个问题都不敢回答
Such a coward. Can't even answer a simple question.

359
00:26:58,351 --> 00:27:01,320
你想得到我？那就来呀
You want me? Come and get me.

360
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:02,886
拉娜，停下！
Lana, stop!

361
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:06,991
怎么了，克拉克？恐高？
What's the matter, Clark? Afraid of heights?

362
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,862
你干什么呢？快下来！
What are you doing? Come down!

363
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:17,625
拉娜！
Lana!

364
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:29,539
拉娜！
Lana!

365
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:34,174
克拉克
Clark.

366
00:27:43,696 --> 00:27:44,856
让开
Coming through.

367
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:49,525
发生什么事了？
What happened?

368
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:52,395
她和爸爸以及比尔斯的症状一样
She's got the same symptoms as Dad and Beels.

369
00:27:54,974 --> 00:27:56,407
爸爸怎么样了？
How's Dad?

370
00:27:56,576 --> 00:28:01,946
他陷入昏迷了，医生不知道他还能活多久
He slipped into a coma. The doctors don't know how long he'll last.

371
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:16,958
我已经让医生从大都会飞过来了 我会竭尽所能救治肯特先生
I've got doctors flying in from Metropolis. I'm going to do everything I can for Mr. Kent.

372
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:34,435
克拉克，我很抱歉
Clark, I'm sorry.

373
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:37,982
不是你的错，莱克斯
It's not your fault, Lex.

374
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:58,598
- 哈密尔顿博士的实验室有一本这样的书 - 尼哥底母日记
<i>-Dr. Hamilton had a copy of this in his barn. -Nicodemus Diary.</i>

375
00:28:58,771 --> 00:29:01,399
这是斯摩维尔第一桩神秘事件的第一手记录
It's a first-hand account of Smallville's first mystery.

376
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:05,066
1871年，连邮局都没有的时候 整个定居点曾经疯狂
In 1871, the whole settlement went postal before they even had a post office.

377
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,804
原来斯摩维尔下陨石雨之前就遭过灾 我好欣慰啊
Nice to know Smallville was whacked before the meteors.

378
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,881
是的，在日记中记载了一种花
Yeah. In the diary, they talk about a flower.

379
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:12,779
定居者管它叫尼哥底母
The settlers called it Nicodemus.

380
00:29:12,952 --> 00:29:19,221
他们说它能释放人压抑着的感情 使人愤怒，发烧，最终…
They said it liberated repressed feelings, sent them into rages, then fever and finally--

381
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:22,089
呃…
Well....

382
00:29:24,797 --> 00:29:26,662
咱们在哪能找到这花？
Well, where can we find this flower?

383
00:29:26,832 --> 00:29:28,197
问题就在这
You see, that's the glitch.

384
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:30,927
劫难过后，骑兵焚毁了这个定居点
After the massacre, the cavalry torched the settlement.

385
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:33,503
他们不希望灾难的根源传播开去
They didn't want whatever caused it to spread.

386
00:29:33,673 --> 00:29:35,470
这花已经绝种100年了
The flower's been extinct for 100 years.

387
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:37,768
哈密尔顿怎么会和这个扯上关系？ 他是个地质学家
How is Hamilton involved in this? He's a geologist.

388
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,001
可他对陨石非常狂热
With a meteor fixation.

389
00:29:39,178 --> 00:29:41,908
我们找到了他6年前写的论文
We tracked down this paper he wrote six years ago.

390
00:29:42,081 --> 00:29:45,539
- 大都会大学校刊 - 我猜这就是最后一根稻草
-Metropolis University Press. -I think this is the last straw.

391
00:29:45,718 --> 00:29:50,781
这里面，他提出假设 陨石可以用来辐射休眠的植物细胞
In it, he postulates that meteor rocks can be used to irradiate dormant plant cells.

392
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:53,390
所以你认为哈密尔顿把尼哥底母给复活了
So you think Hamilton brought back the Nicodemus.

393
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:56,460
- 现在他试图掩盖真相 - 咱们和他谈谈去
-And now he's trying to cover it up. -Let's go talk to him.

394
00:29:56,629 --> 00:30:01,692
等等，还有呢 这本书不是哈密尔顿博士借出的，是莱克斯借的
<i>Wait, there's more. Dr. Hamilton didn't check out The Nicodemus Diary. Lex did.</i>

395
00:30:02,702 --> 00:30:03,828
你认为他也牵涉其中？
You think he's involved?

396
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:05,971
我早跟你说过他不是好人
I told you all along he was bad news.

397
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,799
皮特，这么说为时尚早
Pete, we don't know anything yet.

398
00:30:12,545 --> 00:30:14,376
好
Good.

399
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:21,544
我一会儿打回去 我刚和医生通过电话，他们已经分离出了病原
I'll call back. I just got off the phone with the doctors. They've isolated the problem.

400
00:30:22,955 --> 00:30:26,322
和尼哥底母花有关系吗？
Does it have to do with the Nicodemus flower?

401
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:28,687
我知道你从图书馆借出了那本日记
I know you checked the diary out of the library.

402
00:30:29,762 --> 00:30:31,957
- 是的，我借了，克拉克 - 为什么？
-Yes, I did, Clark. -Why?

403
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:35,828
因为我的公司地产建在那个定居点原址上
Because my property was built on the site of the original settlement.

404
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:39,061
我一直觉得那个故事很有趣 当我听说你爸的事…
I always thought it was an interesting story. When I heard about your dad...

405
00:30:39,238 --> 00:30:42,503
- 我就追根溯源看看是否有帮助 - 问什么你没有告诉我？
-...I tracked it down to see if it could help. -Why didn't you tell me?

406
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:46,711
克拉克，那是个狂想家写的东西 我只是在寻找救命稻草
Clark, it's a crackpot story. I was grasping at straws.

407
00:30:46,879 --> 00:30:49,245
- 你认识史蒂夫・哈密尔顿博士吗？ - 他是谁？
-Do you know Dr. Steven Hamilton? -Who's that?

408
00:30:49,415 --> 00:30:51,542
别跟我撒谎！
Don't lie to me!

409
00:30:52,318 --> 00:30:54,047
克拉克，冷静点
Clark, calm down.

410
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,013
我知道你担心你爸和拉娜
I know you're worried about your dad and Lana...

411
00:30:57,189 --> 00:31:00,124
但是我仅仅是从图书馆借了书而已
...but I checked the book out of the library, that's it.

412
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:06,631
这事不是我的责任，但我在竭尽所能解决它
I'm not responsible for what happened, and I'm doing everything in my power to fix it.

413
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,289
这是实话，克拉克
That's the truth, Clark.

414
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:17,368
手电筒放低
Okay, keep your flashlight low.

415
00:31:17,877 --> 00:31:21,074
现在你是擅闯民宅的高手了？
You're an expert on breaking and entering now?

416
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:28,309
当心！
Be careful!

417
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,805
皮特，怎么了？
Pete, what happened?

418
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:53,638
皮特？你没事吧？
Pete? You okay?

419
00:32:00,152 --> 00:32:01,949
皮特？
Pete?

420
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:08,483
- 你在找我？ - 噢，不好
-You looking for me? -Oh, no.

421
00:32:08,661 --> 00:32:10,822
你知不知道你美得没边儿？
Do you have any idea how beautiful you are?

422
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:16,263
行了，皮特，你被感染了，咱们得去医院
Okay, Pete, you've been infected. We've gotta get you to the hospital.

423
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:21,202
你老是这样，无视皮特 把我当成个可笑的家伙
That's right. Ignore Pete, he's just the funny guy.

424
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:24,867
你才不关心我的感受呢 因为你一心只想着克拉克
You don't sweat his feelings, because you've got eyes for Clark.

425
00:32:25,044 --> 00:32:28,343
冷静点儿，皮特，我打给克拉克
Calm down, Pete. I'm going to call Clark.

426
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:33,979
他八成正跟他的新任好友 莱克斯・卢瑟打成一片呢
He's probably hanging out with his new best friend, Lex Luthor.

427
00:32:46,332 --> 00:32:47,629
把你的车钥匙给我
Give me your keys.

428
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,324
为什么？你要去哪？
Why, where are you going?

429
00:32:54,173 --> 00:32:56,403
我是认真的，克罗伊
I'm serious, Chloe.

430
00:32:57,643 --> 00:32:59,338
把该死的钥匙给我！
Give me the damn keys!

431
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:21,688
他怎么样了？
How is he?

432
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:24,492
不妙
Not good.

433
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:29,563
克拉克，比尔斯先生半小时前死了
Clark, Mr. Beels died half an hour ago.

434
00:33:40,252 --> 00:33:43,779
我使尽浑身解数仍然束手无策
With all my abilities, there's nothing I can do.

435
00:33:46,292 --> 00:33:47,384
要是爸爸出了事，我们该怎么办？
What will we do if Dad--?

436
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,322
我不知道
I don't know.

437
00:33:55,167 --> 00:33:59,331
我跟你说过我第一次见到他的情景吗？
Did I ever tell you about the first time I ever saw him?

438
00:34:01,907 --> 00:34:03,431
没
No.

439
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:09,847
他去大都会大学上金融课 穿着牛仔工作服和法兰绒裤子…
He came to Metropolis U to take a finance course, and he was sitting by a fountain...

440
00:34:10,015 --> 00:34:12,916
坐在喷泉旁边，吃着苹果
...all denim and flannel, eating an apple.

441
00:34:13,085 --> 00:34:15,280
我向他借笔记
And I asked to borrow his notes.

442
00:34:15,454 --> 00:34:20,414
他不知道我是那堂课的记录员 到现在仍然不知道
He didn't know that I was the note-taker for the class. He still doesn't.

443
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:23,324
你真狡猾，妈妈
You're sly, Mom.

444
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:28,992
他真可爱
He was so cute.

445
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:35,362
所以我向他借笔记，他就把笔记本递给了我
So I asked him for his notes, and he just handed over his notebook...

446
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:37,873
都没问我叫什么，于是我说：
...without even asking my name, and I said:

447
00:34:38,043 --> 00:34:41,604
"你怎么知道我一定会还回来？"
"How can you be sure I'll bring it back?" And he said:

448
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:45,477
他回答说:"我愿意信任他人"
"I prefer to believe in people."

449
00:34:46,986 --> 00:34:48,715
这很像爸爸的风格
It sounds like Dad.

450
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:51,856
我记得我看着他，十分尴尬
And I remember looking at him, completely embarrassed...

451
00:34:52,024 --> 00:34:56,222
因为我产生了一个很傻的想法，我在想：
...because I was thinking the dumbest thing. I was thinking:

452
00:34:56,395 --> 00:34:58,363
"老天啊，我希望我能嫁给他"
"God, I hope he marries me."

453
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:01,128
我仍然这么想
I still think that.

454
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:06,363
每天我心里都会隐隐浮现这句话 "老天啊，我希望我能嫁给他"
Every day there's a part of me that says, "God, I hope he marries me."

455
00:35:17,016 --> 00:35:21,112
我很抱歉，肯特夫人 我能跟你说句话吗，克拉克？
I'm sorry, Mrs. Kent. Can I talk to you for a second, Clark?

456
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:23,550
去吧
Go.

457
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:35,831
我很遗憾
I'm so sorry.

458
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:39,232
哈密尔顿博士在说谎 我在他的仓库发现了尼哥底母花
Dr. Hamilton was lying. I found the Nicodemus flower in the barn.

459
00:35:39,405 --> 00:35:41,737
皮特也感染了，他变得好吓人
One got Pete, and he took a quick turn to scary.

460
00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:43,636
- 他去哪了？ - 他拿着枪…
-Where'd he go? -He grabbed a gun...

461
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:45,902
说要去找莱克斯
...and he said he was going after Lex.

462
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:55,983
这花已经灭绝了100年了
This flower has existed for-- For hundreds of years.

463
00:35:56,155 --> 00:35:59,647
美洲原住民或许已经发现了某种草药来解毒
Now, the Native Americans must have developed some sort of herbal antidote...

464
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:01,656
这是制药说明
...and these are the instructions.

465
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:04,091
- 你在哪发现的？ - 在博物馆收集的
-Where'd you find it? -Collecting dust in a museum.

466
00:36:04,263 --> 00:36:08,427
- 这是独一无二的，他们还想拿回去 - 我会把这个交给我在大都会的小组
-It's a one of a kind, so they want it back. -I'll get it to my team in Metropolis.

467
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,862
谁都不许走
Nobody's going anywhere.

468
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,032
皮特
Pete.

469
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:16,634
你在这里干什么？
What are you doing here?

470
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:23,038
我知道你是幕后黑手 你假意做克拉克的朋友，其实根本不是
I knew you were behind this. You pretended to be Clark's friend, but you're not.

471
00:36:24,316 --> 00:36:28,548
现在他父亲就要被你害死了
And now his dad's gonna die. Because of you.

472
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,052
- 这是怎么回事？ - 别假装你不知道
-What's this about? -Do not pretend you don't know.

473
00:36:31,223 --> 00:36:32,451
我去过你的仓库！
I went to your barn!

474
00:36:32,624 --> 00:36:34,592
他被感染了
He's infected.

475
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,218
皮特，我们找到解药了 我们会把所有人都治好的
Pete, we have the cure. We're going to make everyone better.

476
00:36:38,397 --> 00:36:42,390
你只是个骗子，克拉克没看出来 但是我看出来了，你要付出代价
You're nothing but a liar. Clark can't see it, but I can. And now you're gonna pay.

477
00:36:42,568 --> 00:36:43,557
不！
No!

478
00:36:48,474 --> 00:36:54,470
皮特，如果那本书烧毁了 你、拉娜和肯特先生都会死的
Pete, if that book is destroyed, you and Lana and Mr. Kent will all die.

479
00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:55,635
你在说谎
You're lying.

480
00:36:55,814 --> 00:36:57,111
皮特，我想帮助你
Pete, I want to help you.

481
00:36:57,282 --> 00:37:00,581
你只想着你自己，根本不愿意帮助别人！
You don't want to help anybody but yourself!

482
00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:03,653
你来到我们镇上 突然就成了克拉克最好的朋友！
You come to town and suddenly you're Clark's new best friend!

483
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:08,693
- 我本来以为他很会看人 - 莱克斯，那本书？
-I thought he was a good judge of character. -Lex, the book?

484
00:37:11,597 --> 00:37:14,464
皮特，我要到那边把书取出来
Pete, I'm going to reach in there and grab that book.

485
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,100
如果你要开枪…
If you want to shoot me...

486
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:20,503
那就开吧
...go ahead.

487
00:37:20,672 --> 00:37:22,765
没问题
No problem.

488
00:37:27,112 --> 00:37:28,807
快走
Get out.

489
00:37:35,721 --> 00:37:37,279
永别吧，莱克斯
Say goodbye, Lex.

490
00:37:37,456 --> 00:37:40,050
皮特！别这样
Pete! Don't do it.

491
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:41,920
我们曾是最亲密的朋友
We used to be best friends.

492
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:46,121
他老爸害惨了我老爸 现在他又想搅乱咱俩的友谊
His dad screwed over my dad, and now he's trying to screw up things between us.

493
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:48,664
世界没有他会更美好
The world's a better place without him.

494
00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:50,301
皮特，放下枪
Pete, put the gun down.

495
00:37:50,469 --> 00:37:54,405
他是幕后黑手，我看见哈密尔顿来这儿了
He's behind all this. I saw Hamilton here.

496
00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:57,840
他们一起策划的这件事！
They're working on this together!

497
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:01,741
- 这是真的吗？ - 克拉克，他产生鲁莽幻觉了
-Is that true? -Clark. He's delusional.

498
00:38:01,914 --> 00:38:06,351
我不相信你 你说对了，皮特，他对每个人都不说实话
I don't believe you. You're right, Pete, he's been lying to everyone.

499
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:08,179
我知道我真正的朋友是谁
I know who my true friends are.

500
00:38:08,353 --> 00:38:09,684
我就知道你会醒悟的
I knew you'd see the light.

501
00:38:14,293 --> 00:38:16,386
克拉克，你要干什么？
Clark, what are you doing?

502
00:38:16,562 --> 00:38:18,496
这事你逃不脱了，莱克斯
Can't talk your way out of this one, Lex.

503
00:38:18,664 --> 00:38:21,792
我知道你的真面目了，友谊到此结束
I see you how you really are. The friendship is over.

504
00:38:26,605 --> 00:38:28,095
打得好
Nice one.

505
00:38:28,273 --> 00:38:30,503
我来干掉他
I'll finish him.

506
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:34,675
你怎么做到的？
How'd you do that?

507
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:37,713
别担心，皮特，我们会送你去医院的
Don't worry, Pete, we'll get you to the hospital.

508
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,780
克拉克，搞什么啊？
Clark, what the hell?

509
00:38:46,959 --> 00:38:49,189
对不起，莱克斯
I'm sorry, Lex.

510
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:53,626
所以刚才那是在演戏？
So that was an act?

511
00:38:53,799 --> 00:38:56,597
我不知道还有什么别的办法 他会对你开枪的
I didn't know what else to do. He was gonna shoot you.

512
00:38:57,436 --> 00:39:00,599
你差点连我都骗过了，我以为你来真的
You had me for a moment. I thought you were serious.

513
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:03,536
你在农场吃什么长大的？
What do they feed you on that farm?

514
00:39:05,077 --> 00:39:06,476
哈密尔顿真来过？
Was Hamilton really here?

515
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:10,047
你觉得呢，克拉克？
What do you think, Clark?

516
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:28,226
早上好啊，小懒睡虫
Morning, sleepyhead.

517
00:39:30,269 --> 00:39:31,964
爸爸，你好了
Dad, you're okay.

518
00:39:32,137 --> 00:39:38,098
是的，克拉克 克拉克，我怎么会在这儿？
Yeah. Clark. Clark, what am I doing here?

519
00:39:38,277 --> 00:39:41,474
强纳森！哦，亲爱的！
Jonathan! Oh, sweetheart!

520
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:43,842
- 玛莎 - 哦，亲爱的！
-Martha. -Oh, sweetheart!

521
00:39:44,016 --> 00:39:47,918
昨晚大都会的医生找到了解药 是美洲原住民的疗法
The doctors in Metropolis found a cure last night. It was an old Native American remedy.

522
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:50,520
- 皮特和拉娜怎么样了？ - 他们已经下床了
-How are Pete and Lana? -They're already up.

523
00:39:52,291 --> 00:39:54,816
- 爸爸，你还记得什么吗？ - 不记得
-Dad, do you remember anything? -No.

524
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:59,259
- 医生认为是发烧导致的 - 相信我，不记得最好
-The doctors think it's because of the fever. -Trust me, it's better that way.

525
00:39:59,431 --> 00:40:02,730
- 那是怎么回事？ - 哦，亲爱的
-Come on, what are you talking about? -Oh, sweetheart.

526
00:40:06,471 --> 00:40:09,099
哈密尔顿博士，你在吗？
Dr. Hamilton, hello?

527
00:40:33,799 --> 00:40:35,460
- 你对我的实验室做了什么？ - 我毁了它
-What'd you do with my lab? -Destroyed it.

528
00:40:35,634 --> 00:40:37,795
- 你怎么敢！ - 找到解药算你走运
-How dare you! -You're lucky you found a cure...

529
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:40,096
而且治好后没人记得发生的事
...and nobody infected can remember anything.

530
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:41,534
但还是会引人议论
But people are talking.

531
00:40:41,707 --> 00:40:45,199
比尔斯是我父亲的员工 而且克罗伊・苏利文也有可能
Beels worked for my father, and then there's Chloe Sullivan.

532
00:40:45,377 --> 00:40:47,538
我预感咱俩的合作关系到此为止了
I'm sensing this relationship is over.

533
00:40:47,713 --> 00:40:53,345
不，博士，我认为你很有才华 你只是需要更严格的监督
No, doctor, I think you're very talented. You just need closer supervision.

534
00:40:54,086 --> 00:40:57,522
我最近获得了大都会外的一处小型研究设施
I recently acquired a small research facility outside Metropolis.

535
00:40:57,689 --> 00:41:01,420
卡德摩斯实验室？我会把你安置在那里
Cadmus Labs? I'm gonna hide you out there.

536
00:41:02,761 --> 00:41:06,253
记住，莱克斯，是你打开了潘多拉的盒子
Remember, Lex, you're the one opening Pandora's box.

537
00:41:06,431 --> 00:41:09,332
我只是钥匙，哈密尔顿博士
I'm just the key, Dr. Hamilton.

538
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:25,344
好了，睁开眼睛，拉娜
Okay, open your eyes, Lana.

539
00:41:30,021 --> 00:41:31,716
那是大都会
There's Metropolis.

540
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,682
真美啊
It's beautiful.

541
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:38,823
真不敢相信咱们到这上面来了
I can't believe we're up here.

542
00:41:39,364 --> 00:41:43,095
其实下去才比较困难
It's actually getting down which is gonna be the interesting part.

543
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:48,129
你能恢复回来真好，拉娜
It's good to have you back, Lana.

544
00:41:49,508 --> 00:41:55,845
我花了一整天向塔龙员工 莱克斯和惠特尼道歉
I spent the entire day apologizing to the Talon staff and to Lex and to Whitney.

545
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:59,381
但就是不记得发生了什么
I just wish I could remember what happened.

546
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,951
听起来是我有点失控了
It sounds like I got a little out of control there.

547
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:07,820
你口无遮拦，做事随心所欲 有点像个拉娜女强人了
You spoke your mind, and you did what you wanted. Kind of an alpha Lana.

548
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:14,093
真不敢相信我那样穿衣服
I couldn't believe what I was wearing.

549
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:17,392
我还有点喜欢呢
I kind of liked it.

550
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:27,607
我没对你说什么或者做什么尴尬的事吧
I didn't say or do anything embarrassing to you that I should know about...

551
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:29,610
有吗?
...did I?

552
00:42:33,785 --> 00:42:35,412
没有
No.

553
00:42:37,756 --> 00:42:41,453
那就好
Good. Good.

554
00:42:42,761 --> 00:42:45,093
那么，现在在世界之巅感觉如何啊？
So how does it feel to be on top of the world?

555
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:49,799
或者至少是在斯摩维尔小镇之巅？
Or at least Smallville?

556
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:58,002
我觉得很自由
I feel free.
