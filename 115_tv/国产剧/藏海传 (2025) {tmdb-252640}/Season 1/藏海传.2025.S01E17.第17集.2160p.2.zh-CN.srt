Tyler.

5
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:45,970
-I missed you. -Missed you too, Mom.

6
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,743
Did you get my postcards?

7
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,816
I didn't think you'd come.

8
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:59,451
-I'm getting the doctor. -Wait, Tyler.

9
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:02,857
I asked you to come home for a reason.

10
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:07,528
I need you to help me.

11
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,905
I want you to help me die, Tyler.

12
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,840
Don't talk like that, you're gonna get well.

13
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:24,109
I want to be buried back home, in Smallville.

14
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,252
You have to be strong, Mom.

15
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:31,121
I can't fight this anymore.

16
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:38,895
If you love me, you'll do this for me.

17
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:28,671
I love you, Mom.

18
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,643
And I love you, Tyler.

19
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:57,036
Oh, my God, security! Get me security now!

20
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,609
Get away from her!

21
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,507
-She was in pain! -What's going on?

22
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,942
I think he killed her.

23
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:05,375
Let go! Let go! Let go!

24

Possibly the result of impact.

-我去叫医生 -等等，泰勒

67

我让你回家是有原因的

我需要你的帮助

69
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,905
我想你帮我安乐死，泰勒

别这样讲，你肯定会变好的

71
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:24,109
我想让你把我骨灰埋在小镇

72

89
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,968
快点快点

90
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:05,869
可能是撞击造成的

91
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:11,678
好的，泰勒，让我看看脑子里有什么

92

You're right, you can't save them from old age and illness...

99
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:17,367

为什么我们不开始送货？

我被派下来彻查整件事情
And I've been authorized to come down and go through it in a thorough manner.

148
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:06,601
这是拒绝跟我父亲回大都会得到的惩罚吧
So this is payback for turning down my father's offer to join him in Metropolis.

149
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:10,306
莱诺对你一直是很纵容的
Lionel has been very tolerant of your excesses.

150
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:14,544
但这次你并没有把钱花在聚会和跑车上
But this time you didn't spend the money on parties and sports cars.

151
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,847
他想知道这笔钱去了哪里
He wants to know where it went.

152
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:22,091
你知道我父亲给我的10岁生日礼物是什么吗？
Do you know what my father gave me for my 10th birthday?

153
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:24,661
一本《权力意志》
A copy of <i>The Will to Power.</i>

154
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:29,561
"仰视超人，战胜人类"
"Behold the superman. Man is something to be overcome."

155
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:33,764
孙武子，马基雅弗利，尼采…
Sun Tzu, Machiavelli, Nietzsche...

156
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,501
…就是这些书在我母亲死后陪伴着我
...they were the voices that nurtured me after my mother died.

157
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:41,370
我父亲把每个问题变成考验 每个选择变成一场试验
My father made every question a quiz. Every choice a test.

158
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:45,777
第二名就是失败者 爱心只属于弱者，不能相信任何人
Second best was for losers. Compassion, for the weak. Trust no one.

159
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,886
我成长中学到的就是这些
Those are the lessons I grew up with.

160
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:52,190
如果我能被传记频道采访，我会说出来的
I'll remember that if I'm ever interviewed by the Biography Channel.

161
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:59,388
多米尼克，我是想请你想想我是谁教养大的
All I'm saying, Dominic, is try and remember who I was raised by.

162
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,962
虽然我不愿承认，但我仍是我父亲的儿子
I try to deny it, but I'm still my father's son.

163
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,961
你保重吧
Tread carefully.

164
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:10,398
- 到你了 - 谢谢
-Here you go. -Thanks.

165
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,475
你这不是看书，只是翻书啊
Looks like a real page-turner.

166
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:21,211
我父亲要和我进行一年一度的钓鱼旅行
My father and I have our annual fishing trip.

167
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:25,448
是啊，我父亲只和我进行过一次钓鱼旅行
Of course you do. My father and I went on a fishing trip once.

168
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:30,085
- 他不像是会钓鱼 - 他的确不会，我们是去当诱饵的
-He doesn't seem like the fishing type. -He's not. We were the bait.

169
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:35,523
我们那次是飞去南澳大利亚 和一些大人物亲近
We flew to South Australia, got up-close and personal with a couple of great whites.

170
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,896
听起来很幸福啊
Sounds like a real Kodak moment.

171
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:42,302
当你像他这样富到高不可攀的时候 会想做些事情，让自己感觉是真正活着
When you're rich and untouchable like he is, you do things to make yourself feel alive.

172
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,806
你为什么要去？
Why'd you go?

173
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:47,935
因为他觉得我不会答应 我们只进行过那一次亲子旅行
Because he didn't think I would. We never went on another father-son trip.

174
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,708
我希望我爸别老是领我钓鱼，也安排点别的
I wish my father would do something other than fishing.

175
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:52,612
看场足球赛怎么样？
How about a football game?

176
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:56,221
我有两张星期天大都会鲨鱼队的比赛，是包厢
I've got two tickets for the skybox at the Metropolis Sharks game Sunday.

177
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:57,852
给你吧
They're yours.

178
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,686
那太棒了，我父亲一整个赛季都在追这个队
That'd be great. My father's followed the team all season.

179
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,057
- 用这个比较容易改变他的想法 - 问题解决了
-I wouldn't even have to twist his arm. -Problem solved.

180
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,910
拉娜，怎么了？
Lana, what is it?

181
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:27,510
是惠特尼的母亲，她刚打来说他父亲心脏病发作
That was Whitney's mom, his dad just had another heart attack.

182
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:48,305
啊啊！
Whoa, whoa!

183
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,873
偷偷接近拿着焊枪的人太危险了
It is not a good idea to sneak up on somebody with an acetylene torch.

184
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,642
很抱歉，我叫多米尼克，为莱诺・卢瑟工作
I'm sorry. My name's Dominic Senatori, I work for Lionel Luthor.

185
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:04,952
我到这儿来是调查莱克斯・卢瑟最近的一项计划
I'm here following up on a research project Lex Luthor recently instigated.

186
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:08,116
如果你不介意，我还有很多事要做
If you don't mind, I've got a lot of work to do around here.

187
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:13,823
你的儿子和莱克斯的保时捷 曾在桥边发生了意外
There was an incident involving your son and Lex's Porsche and a bridge.

188
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:17,696
莱克斯花了相当多的时间金钱 调查那次撞车
Lex has spent a considerable amount of time and capital researching the crash...

189
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,963
…我在想你是否知道原因
...and I was wondering if you knew why.

190
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:23,472
事实是，莱克斯・卢瑟像疯子一样开车
Look, the truth is, Lex Luthor was driving like a maniac.

191
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:25,633
他的车撞到桥栏冲进河里…
His car went off the bridge into the water...

192
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:29,508
我儿子跳下去,冒生命危险救了他，就这样
...my son jumped in, risked his life to save him, that's the end of the story.

193
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:32,446
那你应该不知道他为何对你们家
You wouldn't know why he commissioned an in-depth profile...

194
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,518
进行深入的监视调查吧
...into you and your family.

195
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:41,526
我不清楚
I have no idea.

196
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,730
很好，肯特先生，打扰你了
Fair enough, Mr. Kent. Thanks for your time.

197
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:54,069
出于好奇问问，莱克斯的调查发现了什么？
Just out of curiosity, what were Lex's findings on the crash?

198
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,582
惠特尼，是你吗？
Whitney, is that you?

199
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:10,478
是克拉克・肯特，佛得曼先生
It's Clark Kent, Mr. Fordman.

200
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,055
拉娜
Lana.

201
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:18,987
惠特尼去哪了？我还没见到我儿子
Well, where's Whitney? I haven't seen my son yet.

202
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,725
别担心，他马上就来
Don't worry, he'll be here soon.

203
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:28,362
- 惠特尼在哪？ - 我不清楚
-Where is Whitney? -I don't know.

204
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,072
他妈妈说他会来的
His mom said he'd be here.

205
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:44,717
克拉克，惠特尼的爸爸怎么样了？
Clark, how's Whitney's dad?

206
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,452
- 他还能坚持 - 很好
-He's hanging in there. -That's good.

207
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,465
- 你记得这个吗？ - 是我第一根鱼竿
-You remember this? -It's my first fishing rod.

208
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:57,625
你那时整天在小牧场拿着它练投饵
You used to practice casting it out in the paddock all day.

209
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:59,703
- 我记得 - 事实上…
-I remember. -In fact...

210
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:04,366
我记得那时不得不从你手上夺下它 才能让你上床睡觉
...I remember I used to have to pry it out of your hands to get you to go to bed.

211
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,371
爸爸，如果下周末我们坐在豪华包厢…
Dad, what would you say if we could be sitting in the deluxe box...

212
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:11,482
…看大都会鲨鱼队的比赛，你觉得如何？
...next Sunday watching the Metropolis Sharks?

213
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,550
我会说银河队变了许多
I'd say the Milk River's changed quite a bit.

214
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:16,979
考虑一下
Think about it.

215
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:21,359
没有虫饵，不用忍受寒冷的早上 不用吃罐头桃子
No worms, no cold mornings, no eating canned peaches.

216
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:25,395
等等，是莱克斯・卢瑟为我们安排了这个？
Wait a minute. Did Lex Luthor arrange all this for us?

217
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:31,493
克拉克，早上有个莱诺・卢瑟的手下意外来访
Clark, this morning I had a surprise visit from one of Lionel Luthor's people.

218
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:35,333
你知不知道莱克斯・卢瑟撞车事故后 找人调查了我们？
Did you know Lex Luthor was having us investigated after the bridge accident?

219
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:38,476
知道，但莱克斯说都过去了 他保证不会再有了
Yeah, but Lex said that was all in our past. He promised.

220
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:47,642
- 你知道了却没有告诉我？ - 因为我知道你会这个反应
-You knew and you didn't tell me? -Because I knew you'd react like this.

221
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:52,085
我本以为我们互相理解
I thought we had an understanding.

222
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,783
如果你不让我知道真相 我怎么保护你？
How am I to protect you if you won't give me the facts?

223
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,452
- 我不需要保护 - 涉及到你的秘密，你就需要了
-I don't need protection. -When it comes to your secret you do.

224
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:01,293
等你长大了，你会明白我对…
When you get older, you'll understand my apprehension...

225
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:04,163
- …卢瑟家族那种忧虑了 - 别总把我当个孩子
-...about the Luthor family. -Stop treating me like a kid.

226
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:07,305
我不是七岁，也不会在小牧场抛钓线了
I'm not 7 anymore, I'm not casting lines in the paddock.

227
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:11,569
我甚至不喜欢钓鱼 我去钓鱼只是为了让你高兴
I don't even like fishing, the only reason I do it is because it makes you happy!

228
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,249
我不该这么说
That didn't come out right.

229
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:23,983
不，儿子，你该说的
No, son, I think it did.

230
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,520
小胡椒？
Pepper?

231
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:04,829
小胡椒
Pepper.

232
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,200
我给你带了白玫瑰
I brought you a white rose.

233
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:40,597
你活在痛苦中，太久了 没想过有一天结束这一切吗？
You've lived so long with pain. Sometimes don't you wish it would just end?

234
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,560
想过
Oh, yes.

235
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:48,238
我无法像这样坚持下去了
I can't go on, not like this.

236
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,705
马上就能结束了
It'll all be over soon.

237
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,403
我保证
I promise.

238
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,877
爸爸呢？
Where's Dad?

239
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,848
他说今天有很多活要干 想早点开始
He wanted to get an early start, said he had a lot of work to do today.

240
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,211
他在逃避我，对吗？
He's avoiding me, isn't he?

241
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,356
我不想做调解人 你们两个要自己解决
I'm not gonna play referee. You two need to work this out.

242
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:41,516
我们会的 开始先是一星期尴尬的冷战
We will. First we'll have a week of uncomfortable silence...

243
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:45,220
…然后我们再谈些微妙的话 最后把这事抛到背后
...then we'll talk about something trivial. And then we'll move on.

244
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:50,498
逃避，希望问题自己消失 不是处理问题的办法
Avoiding it and hoping the problem goes away isn't dealing with it.

245
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:54,833
- 我能怎么办，你知道他有多固执 - 我知道你们俩都固执
-You know how stubborn he can be. -I know how stubborn you both can be.

246
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,531
我不希望你们俩疏远…
I don't want you to drift apart...

247
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,268
- …就像他和他爸爸一样 - 爸爸和爷爷不是很亲密吗？
-...like he did with his father. -I thought they were close.

248
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:02,073
开始是，但后来他们互相隐瞒一些事
They were, but they kept things from each other.

249
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,908
当你祖父去世的时候…
When your grandfather passed away...

250
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,883
…你爸爸很后悔有那么多事没告诉他
...there was a lot your dad didn't get to tell him, a lot he regrets.

251
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:12,114
我只是不希望历史在你们身上重演
I just don't want to see history repeat itself.

252
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:23,834
克罗伊，我刚看到你的留言 真是难以相信，我昨天才见过赛克女士
Chloe, I just got your note. I can't believe it. I just saw Mrs. Sikes yesterday.

253
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:27,165
- 我知道，我很遗憾，克拉克 - 发生了什么？
-I know. I'm sorry, Clark. -What happened?

254
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:31,305
官方说法是，发生了一场火灾 但他们只找到了她的骨灰
The official story is, there was a fire. But all they found were her ashes.

255
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,707
- 非官方的说法呢？ - 她自燃了
-And the unofficial? -Spontaneous combustion.

256
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:36,074
她认为那老太太能自己烧着
She thinks the old lady just burst into flames.

257
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:41,117
“1978的10月，在新泽西的伊丽莎白市 乔伊斯・马斯洛跳舞时…
"October 1978. Joyce Maslow was dancing in Elizabeth, New Jersey...

258
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:44,346
…突然她的头背部着火，火焰包围了她
...when flames burst from her head and back, enveloping her.

259
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:49,252
瞬间她像一个人体火炬 在她吓坏了的男友面前自燃烧毁”
In seconds she was a human torch, consumed before her horrified boyfriend."

260
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:52,591
- 你也不用这么高兴啊 - 我不是高兴，是感兴趣
-You don't have to look so happy. -I'm not happy, I'm intrigued.

261
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:55,324
意味着你要继续调查了
Which means you're still gonna look into it.

262
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,765
- 我有那么容易看透吗？ - 有啊
-Am I that transparent? -Yes.

263
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,204
肯特先生？
Mr. Kent?

264
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:11,040
- 克拉克不在这 - 事实上，我是来找你的
-Clark isn't here. -Actually, I came to see you.

265
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:14,708
你下周末是否会去看比赛
I was wondering if you're planning on coming to the game next Sunday.

266
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:18,081
我准备去钓鱼，莱克斯 我不知道我的儿子要干什么
I'm going fishing, Lex, I don't know what my son is doing.

267
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:23,694
- 那两张赛票是礼物 - 我确信你的本意是高尚的
-The tickets were meant as a gift. -I'm sure your intentions were noble.

268
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:31,926
这样不公平，你始终不理解 我很尊重克拉克和你们家
That's not fair. I don't think you understand how I regard Clark and your family.

269
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,766
不，我非常理解
Yes I do, I understand perfectly well.

270
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,432
我们只是你们父子漫长棋局赛的小棋子
We're just the pawns in your eternal chess game with your dad.

271
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:42,611
- 你有全家福吗？ - 有，有很多全家福
-Do you have a family photo? -Yeah, I've got lots of family photos.

272
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:47,347
我和我爸爸的唯一一张合影 只在卢瑟集团的年度报告里有
The only picture of my father and me appears in the LuthorCorp annual report.

273
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:51,317
我该因此为你感到遗憾吗？
Is this the part where I'm supposed to feel sorry for you?

274
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,481
不，我只是希望你能理解…
No, I just want you to understand...

275
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:56,822
…如果我对你家有唯一错误的念头，那就是嫉妒
...if I'm guilty of anything regarding your family, it's envy.

276
00:19:57,462 --> 00:20:00,727
如果你嫉妒我们家，为何觉得有必要…
If you're so envious of my family, then why do you feel the need...

277
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:03,527
…在我背后调查我家
...to investigate it behind my back?

278
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:07,970
我想知道事故那天到底发生了什么
I wanted to know what happened the day of the accident.

279
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:11,743
我本有一套推论，但证实是错的 这件事我全跟克拉克坦白过了
I had a theory and it was false. I was totally up-front with Clark about it.

280
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:16,505
就是这么回事
That's what this is about.

281
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,980
- 克拉克没有跟你坦白 - 他是个好孩子，莱克斯
-Clark wasn't up-front with you. -He's a good kid.

282
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,585
- 这点我不想他改变 - 我也不想
-I don't want that to change. -Neither do I.

283
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:28,157
你知道…
You know...

284
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:32,855
…从我第一次遇到克拉克 你看到的只有我的姓氏“卢瑟”
...from the day I first met Clark, all you've ever seen is the name Luthor.

285
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:36,728
至今你也没有给我个好理由，让我看到别的
Well, so far you haven't given me a reason to see anything else.

286
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:52,842
看了上周堪萨斯州赛没？
See that Kansas State game last week?

287
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:56,354
你怎么在这，克拉克？ 拉娜让你来的？
What are you doing here, Clark? Lana send you?

288
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:00,291
我告诉她你在一英里之外就能看得出来
I told her you'd see it coming a mile away.

289
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,188
嘿，我没生气
Hey, I'm not angry.

290
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:07,831
所以，你是来看看 为什么无情的儿子…
So, you've come to find out why the heartless son...

291
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,458
…还没去医院看他病危的父亲
...hasn't gone by the hospital to visit his dying father.

292
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:13,298
差不多吧
Something like that.

293
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:20,069
我记得我爸爸一直说 我将来第一次打进鲨鱼队时…
I remember how my dad used to say how he'd be there the day...

294
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:22,475
…他一定要在场亲眼看着我
...I threw my first pass for the Sharks.

295
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:26,511
- 他一直说，以至于我都相信了 - 他仍然可以的
-He said it so often, I actually believed it. -He still could.

296
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,315
我父亲是我见过最强壮的人
My father was the strongest man I ever knew.

297
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:35,652
他赢过三项州赛大奖
He lettered in three sports at State.

298
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:43,394
当我看到他躺在病床，那么虚弱…
When I see him there in the hospital so weak...

299
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,937
…让我感到窒息 因为我的父亲不该是那样的
...it kills me because that's not my father.

300
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:56,914
不管你做什么，未来很长一段时间 你父亲都能在你身边，支持着你
Whatever you do, for a long time to come, your father is gonna be there to support you.

301
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:01,352
而我将只有一段关于爸爸的记忆
I'll only have a memory of my dad.

302
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,384
我不想让那段记忆变成…
And I don't want that memory to be...

303
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:10,720
…一个虚弱的人躺在医院的病床上
...of that sick man laying there in the hospital.

304
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:20,594
现在我明白了
Now I get it.

305
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:25,641
只是…比起记忆 我随时都会更想接受那个真实的人
It's just.... I'd take the man over the memory any day of the week.

306
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:41,623
克拉克，我一直在找你 看我在《星球日报》上找到什么
Clark, I've been looking all over for you. Look what I found in the <i>Daily Planet.</i>

307
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:45,988
- “大都会停尸间遗体丢失”？ - 对，但你看照片
-"Body Disappears From Metropolis Morgue"? -Yeah, but look at the photo.

308
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,929
验尸官的尸体化为灰烬
The coroner's body was disintegrated into ash.

309
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:51,735
像塞克女士那样
Just like Mrs. Sikes.

310
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:55,361
不知道，我们最好亲自去现场查查
I don't know, but it would be nice to check out that house for ourselves.

311
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:05,176
这可是犯罪现场
You know this is a crime scene.

312
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,783
那又怎么样？
So?

313
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,516
这里其他地方都没有被火毁坏
Well, there's no other sign of fire damage anywhere.

314
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:15,592
让人忍不住又想回到“自燃”的论调上
You might want to dial back on that "spontaneous combustion" skepticism.

315
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,093
- 没有叫声吗？ - 我没打算叫啊
-No barking. -Wasn't planning on it.

316
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,655
- 我是说小胡椒的叫声没有了 - 谁是小胡椒？
-Pepper. -Who's Pepper?

317
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:22,732
塞克女士养的一条狗
Mrs. Sikes' dog.

318
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,802
有生人进来，她就会狂叫不止的
She turned into a barking machine anytime somebody came over.

319
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:27,734
小胡椒？出来，小乖狗
Pepper? Come here, girl.

320
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,397
可能被动物收容所领养走了
Well, Animal Shelter probably came and got her.

321
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:50,152
- 哦，不 - 别告诉我那就是小胡椒
-Oh, no. -Don't tell me that's Pepper.

322
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,709
可能确实是燃烧造成的…
What happened may have been combustion...

323
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:14,579
…但我觉得不是自燃
...but I have a feeling it wasn't spontaneous.

324
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,100
（友情志愿运送餐饮）

325
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:28,260
- 下午好, 玛莎 - 嗨.
-Well, afternoon, Martha. -Hi.

326
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:30,594
我不知道今天你当志愿者
I didn't know that you were volunteering today.

327
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:33,567
带点农场的东西过来，省得浪费
Dropping off some produce, didn't want it to go to waste.

328
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:37,640
- 我帮你拿吧 - 我拿得动，帮我关一下
-Let me give you a hand with that. -I've got it. Just close that for me.

329
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:41,141
好吧，如果需要帮忙就到办公室找我
All right. I'll be in the office if you need me.

330
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:54,750
泰勒！你在那干什么？
Tyler! What are you doing here?

331
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,121
来，让我来帮你
Here, let me help you with this.

332
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,599
杀死塞克女士的凶手就是你
Mrs. Sikes. That was you.

333
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:12,937
- 玛莎, 你还好吗? - 汉克，给警长打电话
-Martha, you okay? -Hank, call the Sheriff.

334
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:15,102
出什么事了？别跑
What's going on here? Hold it right there.

335
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,804
汉克，不！
Hank, no!

336
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:47,242
妈妈
Mom.

337
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:50,110
离她远点
Get away from her.

338
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:52,307
克拉克, 别碰他
Clark, don't touch him!

339
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,519
克拉克, 你怎么样了
Clark, are you okay?

340
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,521
儿子，你妈妈…正在休息
Son, your mom is.... She's resting.

341
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:36,527
她被吓坏了，但我想她很快就会好起来
She's pretty shaken up but I think she's gonna be fine.

342
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,363
警察正到处缉拿泰勒
Police are looking everywhere for Tyler.

343
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:44,497
- 我认为他们制服不了他 - 为什么？
-I don't think they're gonna stop him. -Why?

344
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:49,065
因为我透视到他的心脏 没有跳动
Because I saw his heart. It wasn't beating.

345
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:53,802
克拉克,这没道理 如果他死了还怎么能到处流窜？
Clark, that doesn't make any sense. How can he walk around if he's dead?

346
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:56,413
那他又怎么能把人化为灰烬？
How can he turn people to ash?

347
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:02,647
当他碰到我的脸，我感觉到 生命正被一点点吸走
When he touched my face, I felt like the life was being drained out of me.

348
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:06,513
- 克拉克，你确定没看错… - 是的
-Clark, you sure that you-- -Yeah.

349
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:24,637
爸爸
Dad?

350
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:26,908
什么事?
Yeah?

351
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:31,838
没什么
Nothing.

352
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:01,868
克拉克, 我听说了志愿送餐中心发生的事 你妈妈还好吧？
Clark, I heard what happened at Mobile Meals. Is your mom all right?

353
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:04,379
- 耶 - 简直不敢相信泰勒会伤害大家
-Yeah. -Can't believe Tyler would hurt anybody.

354
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:06,574
- 他看起来多善良呀 - 如果你遇到他…
-He seemed so nice. -lf you run into him...

355
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:09,015
…不管怎么样,千万别让他碰到你
...whatever you do, don't let him touch you.

356
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:12,317
说来话长，听我的就是了
Long story, just trust me.

357
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:16,117
惠特尼打电话，他想一会儿见面谈谈
Whitney phoned. He wanted to get together later and talk.

358
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:17,625
太好了
That's great.

359
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:21,797
我不知道你跟他说过什么，总之，谢谢
I don't know what you said, but thank you.

360
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,199
得走了
Gotta go.

361
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:30,104
嗨,拉娜
Hi, Lana.

362
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:35,479
克拉克, 正巧遇到你 我得和你谈谈观看鲨鱼队比赛的事
Clark, glad I ran into you. I need to talk to you about the Sharks game.

363
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:39,575
- 你爸爸去吗？ - 不确定
-Is your dad coming? -I'm not sure.

364
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:43,910
真有趣，我去问他的时候 他很干脆就拒绝了
Funny. When I asked him, he was pretty adamant he wasn't going.

365
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:49,325
我取消我的邀请，和你爸爸钓鱼吧
I'm rescinding the offer. Go fishing with your dad.

366
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:52,520
- 莱克斯, 你不必这样做 - 我知道
-Lex, you don't have to do that. -I know.

367
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:54,961
但你爸爸想花私人的时间和你在一起
But your dad wants to spend some time with you.

368
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,328
我还是不参与比较好
It's not something I want to come between.

369
00:28:57,502 --> 00:29:00,562
他只想尽量给你些 我爸爸从未给过我的东西
He's just trying to give you something my father never gave me.

370
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,934
- 是什么？ - 限制
-What's that? -Limitations.

371
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:07,238
我爸爸只会告诉我 “别被抓了”或“别闹出丑闻”
All my father ever told me was "Don't get caught. Don't cause a scandal."

372
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,711
那不是爱, 是搞公关
That's not love, that's public relations.

373
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:14,178
你不知道你有多幸运
You have no idea how lucky you are.

374
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:17,287
当我父亲死的时候 国王级的人物都会来参加他的葬礼
When my father dies, kings will come to his funeral.

375
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:21,448
但是当你父亲去世的时候 去葬礼的一定会是他的朋友
But when yours does, his friends will come.

376
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,043
妮尔告诉我，她看见你在这
Nell told me she saw you come out here.

377
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,045
嗯
Yeah.

378
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:48,408
我才意识到我跟你认识了这么久
I just realized that in all the time we've known each other...

379
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:53,054
- 却以前从没来过这 - 没关系的，惠特尼
-...l've never been here before. -It's okay, Whitney.

380
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:56,085
不，不是的
No, it's not.

381
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:01,327
只是想到要失去双亲，这事是多么的可怕
It's just, the thought of losing my parents was so awful...

382
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,291
我不愿去想这些
...I didn't want to think about it.

383
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:07,804
正因此你需要和你爸爸谈谈
That's why you need to talk to your father.

384
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:12,133
去看看他, 惠特尼 好好体会他给你留下的最后的时间
Go see him, Whitney. Make the best of the time he has left.

385
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,521
谢谢你, 拉娜.
Thanks, Lana.

386
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:31,794
我要去医院
I'm gonna go to the hospital.

387
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:36,431
- 我送你回家吧 - 我想再呆一会儿
-Do you want me to walk you home? -Think I'm gonna stay.

388
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:39,368
我有段时间没来这里了
Haven't been out here in a while.

389
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:41,671
好的
Okay.

390
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,870
惠特尼？
Whitney?

391
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,810
没什么, 我不会伤害你
It's all right, I won't hurt you.

392
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:31,217
我不想伤害任何人，拉娜 我只想帮助他们没有痛苦地死去
I don't want to hurt anyone, Lana. I only want to bring them peace.

393
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:38,995
我听到你们间的谈话，他的爸爸一定很痛苦
I heard your friend talking. His father must be in terrible pain.

394
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:41,590
我可以帮助你的朋友
I can help your friend.

395
00:31:56,748 --> 00:32:01,310
购销的记录有些不一致
Then there's the discrepancy between the purchasing and shipping records.

396
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:07,891
别说了，我知道是我爸派你来的 可是今天你还没清算够啊
Stop. I know my father authorized this, but enough bean-counting for one day.

397
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,127
三十年的藏酒，纯麦芽的
Thirty-year-old single malt.

398
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:16,824
也是用我爸爸的钱买的，你别忘了记上
Also bought with my father's money. Make sure you jot that down.

399
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:21,431
让我们坦诚点, 多米尼尔 我爸爸让你到这监视我是因为…
Let's be frank, Dominic. My father sent you here to spy on me because...

400
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,369
…他怕我做得太好
...he's afraid of how well I'm doing.

401
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:27,910
这是证明我自己最后的机会了 他非要认为我会失败
This was my last chance to prove myself and he just assumed I'd fail.

402
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:31,810
现在他不得不改变看法了
Now he has to revise his definition of me.

403
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:34,314
我不再是那个不成器的孩子
I'm not just his screwup son anymore.

404
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:41,422
我现在是他强有力的竞争对手了 我爸爸处理这种竞争只用一种方法
Now I'm competition. My father only knows one way of dealing with competition.

405
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:46,560
这些话留着跟心理医生说就好了，莱克斯
There are some things better left between patient and therapist, Lex.

406
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:51,694
你知道, 在古波斯…
You know, in ancient Persia...

407
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:55,930
…国王会把那些带来坏消息的信使处死
...the kings would kill a messenger who brought them news they didn't like.

408
00:32:56,774 --> 00:33:01,541
而现代, 剑插在胸口恐怕会过火…
In modern times, a sword in the chest might seem a little extreme...

409
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:04,409
…我们需要用更微妙的方式
...something more subtle would be in order.

410
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:07,543
好喝吗？
Enjoying your drink?

411
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,363
真恶心
That's disgusting.

412
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:28,528
我想我应该提醒你“少儿不宜”
I guess I should have mentioned the "May not be suitable for all ages" disclaimer.

413
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:31,106
- 你朋友泰勒最近可真忙 - 什么意思？
-Your friend Tyler's been busy. -What do you mean?

414
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:36,474
他差点谋杀自己的妈妈 然后又从太平间死里逃生
He tried to kill his mother, rose from the dead, and escaped from the morgue.

415
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:41,976
我的朋友查德周末兼职为医检工作 他间接接触到毒物的报告
My buddy Chad works weekends for the M.E. He zip-filed the toxicology report.

416
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:44,587
除了有致命量的止痛药…
Besides that fatal amount of painkillers...

417
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:48,021
…他们还在他尸体内发现一种未知的绿石头
...they found fragments of an unknown green stone embedded in his skin.

418
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:50,389
绿陨石
Meteor rocks.

419
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:53,553
如果这样，那土壤里都有陨石啊 为什么镇里死去的人没有都从坟墓里爬出来？
Then why aren't all Smallville's dead bodies rising from the grave?

420
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:58,766
我觉得是止疼药和陨石的混合作用 才使泰勒变成“恐怖家”的
The combo of painkillers and meteor rocks caused Tyler to pull a "Thriller."

421
00:33:58,936 --> 00:34:01,166
等等，你刚才说泰勒差点杀了他的妈妈？
Didn't you say Tyler tried to kill his mother?

422
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:05,202
对啊，谋杀但未遂，他妈妈恢复得很好 已经送回家疗养了
Tried and failed. His mother recovered enough to be sent home.

423
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:08,676
- 克拉克, 我刚才在墓地遇到了泰勒 - 你没事吧？
-Clark, I just left Tyler in the graveyard. -Are you okay?

424
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:12,475
他听见惠特尼谈论他的爸爸， 他说要帮他安乐死
He heard Whitney talking about his father, he said he could bring him peace.

425
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:14,411
报警了吗？
Did you call the police?

426
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:18,446
你去哪？
Where are you going?

427
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:23,989
别看我，他总是这样
Don't look at me, he does that all the time.

428
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:54,949
- 爸爸？ - 他听不见的
-Dad? -He can't hear you.

429
00:34:58,296 --> 00:35:01,891
- 你是谁？ - 我是来帮你爸爸的，也算是帮你
-Who are you? -I've come to help your father. And you.

430
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,174
我可以结束你的痛苦
I can end your pain.

431
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:15,140
我知道你有多难受…
I know what you're feeling...

432
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:19,448
多痛苦…
...how much it hurts.

433
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,519
我可以让所有痛苦都消失
But I can make it all go away.

434
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:39,400
泰勒，不要！
Tyler, don't!

435
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:49,745
我听到你朋友的话，克拉克 让他看着父亲这样子，也是种莫大的痛苦
I heard your friend, Clark. Seeing his father like this is tearing him apart.

436
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:52,943
- 我这样做，他们俩都能安心 - 但你无权替他们做决定
-I can give them peace. -It's not your decision.

437
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:56,715
你错了，我必须得帮助他
You're wrong. I have to help him.

438
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:05,419
你不是在帮助他们脱离痛苦
You're not taking away their pain.

439
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:08,121
你只会剥夺惠特尼和父亲相处的最后时间
You're stealing Whitney's last chance to be with his father.

440
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,694
你阻止不了我的，克拉克
You can't stop me, Clark.

441
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,693
没人阻止得了
No one can.

442
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:17,364
你就不明白吗？这样会更好，我了解的 我在我母亲的眼睛中看懂了这一切
Don't you see? It's better. I know, I could see it in my mother's eyes.

443
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,407
你母亲还活着
Your mother's alive.

444
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:25,015
她那晚没死，已经痊愈回镇上了
She recovered after that night. They brought her home to Smallville.

445
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:28,010
- 我还以为… - 她活着，泰勒
-I thought-- -She's alive, Tyler.

446
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,154
让我带你去见她
Let me take you to her.

447
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:47,768
真是奇迹啊
It's a miracle.

448
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:52,735
这就是生命，只要还有一口气 就会有希望
It's life. As long as we have that, there's still hope.

449
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,509
她看起来很安详
She seems so peaceful.

450
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:06,253
我本以为我被带回来 是为了减轻别人痛苦的
I thought that I was brought back to relieve the suffering of others.

451
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:08,425
原来只是为了我自己的痛苦而已
But it was my pain all along.

452
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,763
- 我到底干了什么啊？ - 泰勒
-What have I done? -Tyler.

453
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:20,137
我只希望这一切能够结束
I just want it all to be over.

454
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,179
泰勒？
Tyler?

455
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:54,034
很有趣，你选了这么个见面地点，莱克斯
Interesting choice of location for a meeting, Lex.

456
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:00,734
怎么不直接去豪华包间啊
Why didn't you come up to the penthouse?

457
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:04,312
我刚清理完，不想再弄脏大理石地板
I was making a garbage delivery, I didn't want to tarnish the marble.

458
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:06,245
我没心情和你斗嘴，莱克斯
I'm not in the mood to joust, Lex.

459
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:08,642
我希望你能解释下多米尼克来访的事儿
I was hoping you'd explain Dominic's visit.

460
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:14,018
我的审计员发现 镇子这边有一笔下落不明的开销
My auditors discovered unaccounted expenditures coming out of Smallville.

461
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:16,625
- 我认为应该谨慎调查下 - 得了吧，爸
-I thought it prudent to investigate. -Come on, Dad.

462
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:20,457
我在香港挥霍了不止一个周末 你当时也没给我一笔一笔的算账啊
I've squandered more in a weekend. You didn't sic your adding machines on me then.

463
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:24,931
两码事，我们现在谈论的是公司的财政 莱克斯，不是你的零花钱
No, we're talking corporate finances, Lex, not your pocket money.

464
00:38:25,102 --> 00:38:27,036
你心里很困扰，对吗？
It bothers you, doesn't it?

465
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:30,138
因为我不再依赖你了
That I'm not dependent on you anymore.

466
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,799
我在斯摩维尔结识了可以信任的朋友
That I've made friends in Smallville, people I trust.

467
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:36,242
别搞笑了，莱克斯 你做得好，我当然高兴了
Don't be ridiculous, Lex. I'm happy you're doing well.

468
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:40,612
不，你不高兴，你害怕我不再需要你
No, you're not. You're afraid I won't need you anymore.

469
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:48,748
你永远是我的儿子
You'll always be my son.

470
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:54,364
并且你会一直需要我的，莱克斯
And you will always need me, Lex.

471
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:58,057
你就不问问多米尼克的事儿？
Aren't you going to ask about Dominic?

472
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:04,332
他有几个小时都没签到了，对吧？ 这可不是他的一贯作风啊
He hasn't checked in for hours, has he? Unusual for a man of his predictable nature.

473
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:10,307
拿着…
Go ahead...

474
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:13,083
…打开后备箱看看吧
...pop the trunk.

475
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:18,586
哦，莱克斯，他干了什么，怎么了？
Ah, Lex, what has he done, what has he done?

476
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:34,360
父亲，如果你想了解审计的问题 给我打电话就行了
You want to ask an accounting question, Dad? Call me.

477
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:37,166
但下次如果你的手下再骚扰肯特家的话…
The next time one of your drones bothers the Kents...

478
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:40,038
…我一定让他躺着回去
...he'll be lucky to catch a ride home with the spare.

479
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:44,180
莱克斯
Lex.

480
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,583
你有种
Well done.

481
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:06,127
<i>来为你们的大都会鲨鱼队加油…四分卫是…</i>
<i>Now playing quarterback</i> <i>for your Metropolis Sharks...</i>

482
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:10,205
<i>…12号, 惠特尼・佛得曼</i>
<i>...number 12, Whitney Fordman!</i>

483
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,168
开始，攻击，加油！
Down, set, hut!

484
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:17,078
加油，加油，加油！
Hut, hut, hut!

485
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:25,153
漂亮！
Yes!

486
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:34,698
-你没事儿吧，父亲？ -再好不过了
-You all right, Dad? -Never better.

487
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:49,403
你真是为佛得曼家做了件好事儿
That's a really nice thing you've done for the Fordmans.

488
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:55,315
谢谢你，肯特先生 这句话从你口中说出来，对我意义很重
Thanks, Mr. Kent. That means a lot coming from you.

489
00:40:56,587 --> 00:41:01,581
我只是想告诉你 我早就结束对桥上那场事故的调查了
I just want you to know, I closed the book on that day at the bridge.

490
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:04,319
那你当初为什么要调查它？
Why'd you investigate it in the first place?

491
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:07,356
那天是个奇迹
That day was a miracle.

492
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:11,397
你也会很想了解奇迹的原因吧
Haven't you ever wanted to find out why things like that happen?

493
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:15,133
不会
No.

494
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:18,698
我只想接受既成的事实
I just accept the fact that they do.

495
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:23,570
你不必对每件事都追寻解释，莱克斯
You don't need an explanation for everything, Lex.

496
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,711
他怎么能让大都会鲨鱼队来配合这件事
How did he get the Metropolis Sharks to do it?

497
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:35,825
如果你父亲掌管这支球队，那肯定很容易啊
When your father owns the team, it's easier to pull some strings.

498
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:39,326
很奇怪，我一直都觉得莱克斯不喜欢惠特尼
It's strange, all this time I never thought Lex even liked Whitney.

499
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,965
可他却亲自安排了这一切
And then he goes and arranges all this.

500
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:45,033
我觉得莱克斯感觉融入我们的生活了
I think Lex feels he's become part of our lives.

501
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:47,295
我愿意这么想
I'd like to believe that.

502
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:52,071
但其实是你让他这么做的，对么？
You asked him, didn't you?

503
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:58,080
和莱克斯.卢瑟做朋友或许很复杂，但是也有好处
Being friends with Lex Luthor can be complicated, but it has advantages.

504
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,546
- 这是为什么？ - 因为你是你
-What was that for? -Just being you.

505
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,873
- 爸，对不起，我之前说的，有点… - 克拉克…
-Dad, I'm sorry. What I said, it-- -Clark...

506
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:36,348
钓鱼之旅，其实不是为了钓鱼
...the fishing trips, they never had anything to do with fishing.

507
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:40,384
那只是我想和我的儿子好好相处一会儿而已
It was just that I wanted to spend some time with my son.

508
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:48,927
我父亲和我，每天见面，但从不真正交流
My dad and I, we saw each other every day but we never really talked.

509
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:53,868
我只是不想让那样的历史重演
I just don't want history to repeat itself.

510
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,698
我也一样
That makes two of us.

511
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:11,519
爸，我知道今年怎样钓更多鱼了
Dad, I know how we can catch more fish this year.

512
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:13,156
什么，换新的鱼饵么？
What, new lures?

513
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:14,916
用X光透视
X-ray vision.
