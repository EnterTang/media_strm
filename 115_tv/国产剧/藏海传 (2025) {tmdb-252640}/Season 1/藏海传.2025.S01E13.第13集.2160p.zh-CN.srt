3
00:00:04,988 --> 00:00:07,320
Hold nothing back! Leave it all on the floor!

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,425
-How much time we got? -We've got fifteen minutes tops!

5
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:12,424
Just enough time to get in and out!

6
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,421
All right, let's do this thing!

7
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,809
Are you ready now, Clark?

8
00:00:32,983 --> 00:00:35,611
Yeah. I forgot to press the record button. Sorry.

9
00:00:36,486 --> 00:00:38,351
So, Mr. Luthor...

10
00:00:38,521 --> 00:00:41,820
...any more secret construction projects at LuthorCorp like Level 3?

11
00:00:42,025 --> 00:00:43,652
Please, call me Lex.

12
00:00:44,194 --> 00:00:46,662
-Lex, are you gonna answer my question? -Chloe.

13
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,594
-What? -It's okay, Clark.

14
00:00:49,766 --> 00:00:52,326
"Our critics are our friends. They show us our faults."

15
00:00:52,936 --> 00:00:55,370
Benjamin Franklin.

16
00:00:55,939 --> 00:00:57,497
Excuse me, Mr. Luthor...

17
00:00:57,674 --> 00:01:00,700
-...your father's on the phone. -I need to get this.

18
00:01:02,178 --> 00:01:05,113
I'll take it in the conservatory.

19
00:01:06,016 --> 00:01:09,315
I look forward to resuming our verbal judo.

20
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,793
-All right, boys, this is the big one! -Yeah! Let's do it!

21
00:01:20,964 --> 00:01:22,795
Let's go!

22
00:01:22,966 --> 00:01:26,925
I wonder if he's really taking a call or if he's just trying to avoid me?

23
00:01:27,103 --> 00:01:29,367
Wow, that's really cool.

24
00:01:29,572 --> 00:01:31,870
Do you think it's real?

25
00:01:36,946 --> 00:01:39,073
Chloe?

26
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,810
Chloe.

27
00:01:50,093 --> 00:01:52,653
Okay. The vault's in the wall behind the bookcase.

28
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:55,525
-How do you know? -I've got my sources.

29
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:59,532
-He was doing one of the housekeepers. -Oh, yeah.

30
00:02:19,923 --> 00:02:22,448
-We got five minutes, let's move it! -Let's do it!

31
00:02:23,693 --> 00:02:27,151
That's it, boys, come on. It's payday!

32
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:41,032
One minute!

33
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:45,146
-Come on, let's go! -I only got one arm.

34
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,110
Yeah!

35
00:02:49,619 --> 00:02:52,645
Time's up! Let's move it! Let's go!

36
00:02:53,156 --> 00:02:55,556
You can't just go snooping around someone's house.

37
00:02:55,725 --> 00:02:59,889
Clark, it's a mansion. It's designed for snooping.

38
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,721
Okay, fine. We'll go and wait in the library...

39
00:03:02,899 --> 00:03:06,357
...for Lex to officially blow us off.

40
00:03:06,903 --> 00:03:10,532
-I'll put the camera away. -Okay, I'm gonna go get my bag.

41
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,744
Hey, what's going on?

42
00:03:19,516 --> 00:03:21,006
Chloe, run!

43
00:03:46,376 --> 00:03:49,140
Move it! Let's move it!

44
00:03:50,013 --> 00:03:51,002
Clark!

45
00:03:52,015 --> 00:03:53,380
Chloe.

46
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,484
Clark!

47
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,352
Chloe!

49
00:00:04,988 --> 00:00:07,320
别犹豫！动手要干净利落！

50
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,425
- 我们有多少时间？ - 最多十五分钟！

51
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:12,424
刚好够来回一趟！

52
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,421
好，我们干吧！

53
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,809
这回准备好了吧，克拉克？

54
00:00:32,983 --> 00:00:35,611
是，我刚才忘了按记录键 不好意思

55
00:00:36,486 --> 00:00:38,351
那么，卢瑟先生…

56
00:00:38,521 --> 00:00:41,820
…卢瑟公司还有更多像第三层那样 秘密建设的项目吗？

57
00:00:42,025 --> 00:00:43,652
拜托，叫我莱克斯

58
00:00:44,194 --> 00:00:46,662
- 莱克斯，你会回答我的问题吗？ - 克罗伊

59
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,594
- 什么？ - 没事，克拉克

60
00:00:49,766 --> 00:00:52,326
“…批评者是我们的朋友 他们指出我们的错误”

61
00:00:52,936 --> 00:00:55,370
本杰明・富兰克林的名言吧

62
00:00:55,939 --> 00:00:57,497
打扰了，卢瑟先生…

63
00:00:57,674 --> 00:01:00,700
- …您父亲来电 - 我得接这电话

64
00:01:02,178 --> 00:01:05,113
我到花房去接电话

65
00:01:06,016 --> 00:01:09,315
我期待继续与你唇枪舌战

66
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,793
- 好的，兄弟们，这是笔大买卖！ - 是啊！我们干吧！

67
00:01:20,964 --> 00:01:22,795
走吧！

68
00:01:22,966 --> 00:01:26,925
我怀疑他是真的在接电话 还是要躲我？

69
00:01:27,103 --> 00:01:29,367
哇，这个真酷

70
00:01:29,572 --> 00:01:31,870
你认为它是真品吗？

71
00:01:36,946 --> 00:01:39,073
克罗伊？

72
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,810
克罗伊

73
00:01:50,093 --> 00:01:52,653
好的，金库在墙里面，书架后面

74
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:55,525
- 你怎么知道？ - 我自有消息来源

75
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:59,532
- 他勾搭过这的一个佣人 - 哦，爽啊

76
00:02:19,923 --> 00:02:22,448
- 我们有五分钟，赶紧动手吧！ - 我们干吧！

77
00:02:23,693 --> 00:02:27,151
就是这些，兄弟们，今天发财了！

78
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:41,032
剩一分钟了！

79
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:45,146
- 快啊，走了！ - 我只有一只手

80
00:02:49,619 --> 00:02:52,645
时间到了！走啊！快走！

81
00:02:53,156 --> 00:02:55,556
你不能在人家房子里到处窥探

82
00:02:55,725 --> 00:02:59,889
克拉克，这么大的宅邸 当然就是用来被窥探的

83
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,721
好吧，行 我们去书房等吧…

84
00:03:02,899 --> 00:03:06,357
…等着莱克斯正式宣布放我们鸽子

85
00:03:06,903 --> 00:03:10,532
- 我把相机收了 - 好，我要去拿我的包

86
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,744
嘿，这是怎么回事？

87
00:03:19,516 --> 00:03:21,006
克罗伊，快跑啊！

88
00:03:46,376 --> 00:03:49,140
跑啊！快跑啊！

89
00:03:50,013 --> 00:03:51,002
克拉克！

90
00:03:52,015 --> 00:03:53,380
克罗伊

91
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,484
克拉克！

92
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,352
克罗伊！

大卫・科尔斯
Don't worry, I brought in the best doctors from Metropolis.

118
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,739
别担心，我从大都会找了最好的医生

119
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,539
- 她会好起来吗？ - 医生也不确定
-Is she gonna be all right? -Doctors aren't sure.

120
00:05:31,714 --> 00:05:35,810
摔得挺严重，她左手摔断了 而且脑震荡了
The fall was pretty bad. She broke her left arm and has a concussion.

121
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,200
莎拉-简・雷蒙德

122
00:05:36,352 --> 00:05:38,718
他们需要确定没有脑肿胀
They wanna make sure there's no brain swelling.

123
00:05:38,888 --> 00:05:41,516
我本该抓住她
I should've gotten to her.

124
00:05:41,691 --> 00:05:45,457
我不是有意要嗦几句 克拉克，可这不是你的错
I don't mean to belabor the obvious, Clark, but this isn't your fault.

125
00:05:45,628 --> 00:05:49,359
我就是想不通这到底怎么回事 房间本来是空的…
I just don't know what happened. One minute, the room is empty...

126
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,200
联合执行制片:格列哥・比曼

127
00:05:49,532 --> 00:05:51,762
…可一瞬间他们就凭空出现了
...and then they appear out of thin air.

128
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,528
警察有什么线索吗？
I mean, do the police have any leads?

129
00:05:54,704 --> 00:05:57,172
他们认为我不是第一个受害者
They don't think I'm the first one that's been hit.

130
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,241
县里共发生超过十二起劫案
There have been over a dozen robberies all over the county.

131
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,100
监督制片:马克・伏黑顿

132
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:03,241
这伙人不知怎么做到的 无声无息就能进屋，锁头都不用撬

133
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:06,176
他们甚至想袭击斯摩维尔储贷银行
They tried to hit the Smallville Savings & Loan.

134
00:06:06,816 --> 00:06:08,977
我从没听说过
I didn't hear about that.

135
00:06:09,152 --> 00:06:12,485
银行不会公布未遂的劫案 那样会损害它们的形象
Banks don't publicize attempted robberies, it's bad for their image.

136
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,600
联合制片:迈克尔・格林
If nothing was taken, how do they know they were robbed?

137
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:15,783
如果没有东西被拿走 他们怎么能知道差点被劫了？

138
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,358
显然是他们触响了金库里的警报
Apparently they tripped an alarm inside the vault.

139
00:06:18,528 --> 00:06:21,224
尽管这样，也没人知道他们是怎么进去的
Although, no one knows how they got in there.

140
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:24,625
警察能追踪到任何他们从你那偷走的东西吗？
And the stuff they stole from you. Can the police trace it?

141
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,793
我没有上报任何东西被盗，克拉克
I didn't report anything stolen, Clark.

142
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,400
联合制片:道里斯・伊根
-Why not? I saw them walk out with bags. -I don't care about that.

143
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:33,338
- 为什么不？我看见他们拿着包走了 - 我不在乎

144
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,200
联合制片:格雷格・沃克
I just want to find the people who did this to Chloe. When I do...

145
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:36,672
我只是想找出对克罗伊行凶的人 当我找到他们时…

146
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
制片:鲍勃・哈格罗夫
...I promise you, they will be dealt with accordingly.

147
00:06:36,846 --> 00:06:39,906
…我向你保证，他们会受到应有的惩罚

148
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:43,883
- 什么意思？ - 就是说，这事你让我来管就行了
-What does that mean? -It means you should let me worry about it.

149
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,800
联合执行制片:肯・霍顿

150
00:06:44,053 --> 00:06:47,489
你还不回家休息下吗？
Now, why don't you go home and get some rest?

151
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,500
本集编剧:菲利普・利文斯

153
00:07:06,642 --> 00:07:08,405
惠特尼
Whitney.

154
00:07:08,578 --> 00:07:10,876
嘿，惠特尼，等一下
Hey, Whitney, wait up.

155
00:07:11,047 --> 00:07:15,484
- 我以为你会在医院和我见面呢 - 对不起，我忘了，克罗伊怎么样了？
-Thought you're meeting me at the hospital. -I'm sorry, I forgot. How's Chloe?

156
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:17,619
好点了，但是还没过危险期
Better, but not out of the woods yet.

157
00:07:17,787 --> 00:07:21,416
这就是镇上的事 总会有办法让你压抑
That's the thing with this town. It'll always find a way to keep you down.

158
00:07:21,591 --> 00:07:25,357
惠特尼，怎么了，是因为你爸爸的事吗？
Whitney, what's wrong? Is it your dad?

159
00:07:25,595 --> 00:07:28,962
不，没事，我要去整理存货了
No, it's nothing. I've just got to go do inventory.

160
00:07:29,132 --> 00:07:31,259
回见
See you.

161
00:07:50,486 --> 00:07:52,317
嗨，克拉克，你在干什么？
Hi, Clark. What are you doing?

162
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:56,622
- 让自己干点有用的事呗 - 嘿，儿子…
-Trying to make myself useful. -Hey, son...

163
00:07:56,793 --> 00:07:58,954
…我们需要柴火，不是牙签
...we need firewood, not toothpicks.

164
00:07:59,929 --> 00:08:02,955
我知道你们要说什么:这不是我的错
I know what you guys are gonna say: It's not my fault.

165
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:07,432
- 这话莱克斯和克罗伊老爸已经说过了 - 他们是对的，克拉克，你尽力了
-Lex already told me, so did Chloe's dad. -They're right, Clark. You did your best.

166
00:08:07,603 --> 00:08:09,730
- 克罗伊当时说不定会没命了 - 儿子…
-Chloe could've died. -Son...

167
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,340
…成熟的人要学会去懂深刻的道理…
...becoming an adult means learning difficult lessons...

168
00:08:12,508 --> 00:08:16,569
…其中一点就是你救不了每个人，不管你是谁
...one of which is you can't save everybody, no matter who you are.

169
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,941
你说你当时感觉到有陨石在附近
You said you felt the effects of the meteor rocks.

170
00:08:19,115 --> 00:08:22,414
对，我只是不知道从哪来的
Yeah, I just don't know where it was coming from.

171
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:26,946
有时我真希望可以离开这个小镇 离陨石远远的
Sometimes I just wish I could leave this town and get away from the meteor rocks.

172
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,617
我肯定你可以，想走一定有机会的
I'm sure that you will. You'll get that chance.

173
00:08:31,794 --> 00:08:34,126
但是逃避不能真正解决问题
But running away won't solve anything.

174
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:37,096
想要让自己变得更有用 就别耽在这里，只为自己伤情了
Don't hang around here feeling sorry for yourself.

175
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:40,429
行动吧，看看你能查出什么
Go. See what you can find out.

176
00:08:58,821 --> 00:09:02,655
我不知道我在这存放了这么多东西
I had no idea I stored so much stuff in here.

177
00:09:02,825 --> 00:09:06,454
- 你把那个胶带递给我吗，拜托了？ - 好
-Will you hand me the tape, please? -Yeah.

178
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:10,123
我还是不敢相信 你就要卖了这个地方，妮尔
I still can't believe you're selling this place, Nell.

179
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:13,359
我无法相信你怎么 突然就对这地方产生兴趣的
I can't believe your sudden interest in the place.

180
00:09:13,603 --> 00:09:16,538
我父母从前在这里相遇 这地方对我意义重大
My parents met here. This place means a lot to me.

181
00:09:16,706 --> 00:09:18,469
我知道，拉娜…
I know, Lana...

182
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:22,668
…但小电影院无法与大影院抗衡的 而且根本原因是…
...but one screen can't compete with a multiplex. And the fact is...

183
00:09:22,845 --> 00:09:26,645
…我卖它是为了有足够的学费 能送你去读任何你想去的大学
...I wanna be able to send you to any college you want.

184
00:09:31,387 --> 00:09:33,446
你能告诉我买家是谁吗？
Could you tell me who the buyer is?

185
00:09:33,623 --> 00:09:37,286
或许我可以跟他们谈谈 看看他们愿不愿意把这里修复了
Maybe I could talk to them. See if they'd be willing to renovate.

186
00:09:39,395 --> 00:09:41,955
是莱克斯・卢瑟
It's Lex Luthor.

187
00:09:44,555 --> 00:09:45,555
斯摩维尔镇 储蓄与贷款银行
Lex said the people who hit the mansion tried to rob this bank.

188
00:09:45,902 --> 00:09:49,360
莱克斯说袭击公馆的人想抢这家银行

189
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:52,440
我送你几个词：给官方警察调查
I've got three words for you: official police investigation.

190
00:09:52,608 --> 00:09:54,633
那些警察什么都没干成呢
The police haven't done a thing.

191
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:58,541
过去六个月已经有12起抢劫案了 都用那种奇怪的作案方式
There have been 12 robberies in the past six months with the same freaky m.o.

192
00:09:58,714 --> 00:10:01,512
没有任何人进门的迹象，珠宝和现金就不见了
No sign of entry, the jewels and the cash just vanished.

193
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:05,620
只有这个地方幸免，莱克斯说 他们触动了金库里面的一个警报器
Except for this place. Lex says that they triggered an alarm inside the vault.

194
00:10:05,788 --> 00:10:09,554
- 问题是，他们怎么进去的？ - 我想不到
-The question is, how'd they get inside? -I don't know.

195
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:12,922
现在，别再专想克罗伊的事了，快走吧
Now, stop channeling Chloe and come on.

196
00:10:22,772 --> 00:10:25,832
哦，不，不会又使肯特的千里眼吧
Oh, no, not the Kent thousand-yard stare.

197
00:10:26,008 --> 00:10:28,067
克拉克！走吧，老兄
Clark! Come on, man.

198
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,737
我知道你感觉很糟，我也是
I know you feel bad. I do too.

199
00:10:31,914 --> 00:10:34,474
但我们不是警察
But we're not cops.

200
00:10:58,941 --> 00:11:01,205
什么消息都没有,那达
Nothing. Nada.

201
00:11:01,377 --> 00:11:05,677
连个后续报道都没有 被盗十万现金珠宝，人肯定会报警的啊
Not a single sidebar. A guy has got to miss a hundred grand in cash and jewels.

202
00:11:06,182 --> 00:11:08,013
卢瑟就不会报警，兄弟
Not Luthor, bro.

203
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:12,281
没人知道他在那个城堡里藏了多少钱
There is no telling how much jack he's got stashed in that castle.

204
00:11:12,455 --> 00:11:15,151
现金，珠宝，艺术品，汽车，应有尽有！
Cash, jewels, art, cars, you name it!

205
00:11:15,324 --> 00:11:19,090
如果我们下楼，没准还发现他在钱坑里游泳…
If we went downstairs, we would've found the money pit where he swims in the stuff...

206
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:22,162
- …就像那个有爱尔兰口音的鸭子 - 你说的是抠门的史高治（唐老鸭的舅舅）
-...like that duck with the Irish accent. -Uncle Scrooge.

207
00:11:22,331 --> 00:11:26,131
- 是啊，是 - 他是苏格兰口音，不是爱尔兰
-Yeah, yeah. -He was Scottish, not Irish.

208
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:32,600
就算他有钱让我们抢，时间也不够了 我们那种能力不能像原来一样持久了
We don't have enough time. This stuff doesn't last as long as it used to.

209
00:11:33,075 --> 00:11:35,600
我知道，我知道
I know, I know.

210
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,008
我告诉你，我们需要新人加入
I'm telling you, we need fresh blood.

211
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,672
- 是啊，但是我们该相信谁呢？ - 我不知道
-Yeah, but who can we trust? -I don't know.

212
00:11:42,318 --> 00:11:45,617
我想我知道卢瑟为什么没上报劫案了
I think I know why Luthor didn't file that robbery report.

213
00:11:46,222 --> 00:11:48,747
看下这个
Check this out.

214
00:11:50,393 --> 00:11:54,853
这生发水广告男孩不想让人知道他进了…
The poster boy for Rogaine doesn't want anyone to know he's tapped into...

215
00:11:56,832 --> 00:11:58,561
…他老爸的电脑系统
...his daddy's computer system.

216
00:11:58,734 --> 00:12:01,532
我们可以再去拜访小卢瑟敲一笔了，哈？
Maybe then we pay Luthor Junior another visit, huh?

217
00:12:01,704 --> 00:12:04,366
我想也是
I think so.

218
00:12:08,444 --> 00:12:10,969
我不管
I don't care.

219
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,840
如果我想听借口，找警察就行了
If I wanted excuses, I'd call the police.

220
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:20,618
啊？好吧，你们哪还算是大都会 最好的私人保安公司
Yeah? Well, you're supposed to be the best private security firm in Metropolis.

221
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,392
你们怎么进来的？
How'd you get in here?

222
00:12:25,561 --> 00:12:28,894
和上次一样的方法呗，兄弟
The same way we did last time, bro.

223
00:12:32,234 --> 00:12:36,603
- 我要叫警察了 - 你上次没叫，我们知道为什么
-I'm calling the police. -You didn't last time, and we know why.

224
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:40,199
我们看了那张磁碟，莱克斯
We read the disk, Lex.

225
00:12:41,243 --> 00:12:44,212
- 我不知道你在说什么 - 你在从你爸那里搜刮钱…
-What are you talking about? -You're skimming money from your dad...

226
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:47,008
…去资助斯摩维尔的一个项目
...to fund a project in Smallville.

227
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:51,017
那关系到一个甲烷发酵工厂 它将使我们的竞争对手倒闭
That concerns a methane treatment plant. It'll put our competitors out of business.

228
00:12:55,725 --> 00:12:58,717
甲烷工厂不需要粒子加速器吧
Methane plants don't need particle accelerators.

229
00:12:58,894 --> 00:13:02,352
- 你们想要什么？ - 一百万，现金
-What do you want? -A million, cash.

230
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:07,569
如果你想做什么反抗的蠢事，甚至只想试试…
If you try anything stupid, even if you think a stupid thought...

231
00:13:07,737 --> 00:13:10,069
…你那张磁碟就会被上传到网上…
...your disk is going to be uploaded to the Internet...

232
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:14,801
…让全世界的人和莱诺大人都看见
...for all the world and Big Daddy Lionel to see.

233
00:13:14,977 --> 00:13:16,444
我怎么和你们联系？
How do I reach you?

234
00:13:16,612 --> 00:13:19,274
你不需要，我们会联系你
You don't. We reach you.

235
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:24,146
现在，转过去
Now, turn around.

236
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:30,123
等着
Wait there.

237
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:33,826
你们还不知道自己在和谁打交道
You have no idea who you're dealing with.

238
00:13:49,712 --> 00:13:51,976
嘿，惠特尼
Hey, Whitney.

239
00:13:52,281 --> 00:13:54,146
惠特尼？
Whitney?

240
00:13:54,316 --> 00:13:58,844
- 嘿 - 我来给我妈取微波炉
-Hey. -I'm picking up a microwave for my mom.

241
00:13:59,455 --> 00:14:02,583
去后面的柜台上拿吧
You can pick it up at the back counter.

242
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:05,249
一切都好吗？
Is everything okay?

243
00:14:07,696 --> 00:14:11,154
我打赌你很愿意一辈子都呆在斯摩维尔
I bet you think it's just great to live in Smallville your whole life.

244
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:15,667
- 从爸爸那里接管农场 - 我不太想过那种生活
-Take over the farm from dad. -I'm not sure that's the life for me.

245
00:14:15,838 --> 00:14:19,968
- 有时你没有选择 - 惠特尼，你能摆脱这里的
-Sometimes you don't have a choice. -Whitney, you'll get out of here.

246
00:14:20,142 --> 00:14:24,010
- 你能比其他人走得更远的 - 我失去了奖学金，肯特
-You'll go further than anyone in town. -I lost my scholarship, Kent.

247
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:28,176
很遗憾
I'm sorry.

248
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:33,213
你告诉拉娜了吗？
Have you told Lana yet?

249
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:37,649
我将在这家店里度过我的余生…
I am going to spend the rest of my life in this store...

250
00:14:37,827 --> 00:14:43,026
…像我爸一样在五十岁时得严重心脏病 然后死后成了“没人在意的那谁”就完了？
...develop a bad heart at fifty like my dad, and become just another "remember him?"

251
00:14:46,068 --> 00:14:48,901
我永远都走不出斯摩维尔的
I'm never getting out of Smallville.

252
00:14:49,071 --> 00:14:51,301
嘿，伙计，你这双鞋有十二号的吗？
Hey, man, you got these sneaks in a twelve?

253
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,168
有
Yeah.

254
00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:02,474
有问题吗，老兄？
You got a problem, bro?

255
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,516
没
No.

256
00:15:04,687 --> 00:15:07,679
我自己去找吧
I'll go find this.

257
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,027
嘿…
Hey...

258
00:15:20,202 --> 00:15:21,999
- …你不就是惠特尼・佛得曼吗？ - 是
-...aren't you Whitney Fordman? -Yeah.

259
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,139
我是韦德・马哈尼
Wade Mahaney.

260
00:15:24,306 --> 00:15:27,833
去年我看了你对抗托皮卡的比赛 扔出了300码，比赛很漂亮
I saw you throw 300 yards against Topeka last year. That was a great game.

261
00:15:29,111 --> 00:15:31,875
我听说你因为这个 得到堪萨斯州立大学的全额奖学金
I heard you were tracked for a full ride to Kansas State.

262
00:15:33,082 --> 00:15:36,882
- 奖金的事没成真，要十二号，对吗？ - 是，谢谢，伙计
-It didn't work out. Size twelve, right? -Yeah. Thanks, buddy.

263
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,344
兄弟，我很理解你
Man. Well, I know all about that.

264
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:44,788
11年级时，我就被球队解雇了 膝盖断裂，做了四个手术
Senior year I got sacked, blew out my knee, had to have four operations.

265
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,120
巨大的打击
Tough break.

266
00:15:46,295 --> 00:15:49,025
原本有一打的学校要给我全额奖学金…
I had a dozen schools offer me full scholarships...

267
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:53,658
…然后一眨眼，全都没了
...and then it all went away, just like that.

268
00:15:54,737 --> 00:15:57,001
那么，现在你有什么打算吗？
So, what's your plan now?

269
00:15:57,172 --> 00:16:01,700
没有，就是不想后半辈子都做这个
Don't have one. Just don't want to do this the rest of my life.

270
00:16:02,745 --> 00:16:06,738
我理解你，这能有什么未来呢 呃？怎么说…
I hear you. Where's the future in that, huh? Say...

271
00:16:07,349 --> 00:16:09,317
…今晚我们那有一个派对
...we're having a party at our place tonight.

272
00:16:09,752 --> 00:16:11,583
干嘛不来坐坐
Why don't you swing by.

273
00:16:13,289 --> 00:16:15,723
不行，我得呆到店关门
I can't, I've got to close up.

274
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:20,089
关门后来吧，喝杯酒，当散闷
Come by after. Knock back a brew. Detox from this.

275
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:24,628
来啊，兄弟，会很好玩的
Come on, man, it'll be fun.

276
00:16:26,201 --> 00:16:28,499
很好玩啊！
Fun!

277
00:16:29,538 --> 00:16:32,336
我是四分卫的老大
I am the god of quarters.

278
00:16:38,847 --> 00:16:41,816
我带你去四处看看，兄弟，走了
Let me give you the tour, bro. Come on.

279
00:16:44,353 --> 00:16:47,516
- 这地方太棒了 - 也许我们能带上你，佛得曼
-This place is awesome. -Maybe we could bring you on, Fordman.

280
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:51,456
- 我们肯定需要你这么有天份的人 - 你们为什么要帮我？
-Always use a talented guy. -Why do you wanna help me?

281
00:16:51,627 --> 00:16:53,652
我们这种人会相互吸引
Guys like us got to stick together.

282
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:56,855
在橄榄球生涯失败后 我以为这辈子就完了
I thought my life was over after football didn't pan out.

283
00:16:57,032 --> 00:16:59,557
但那只是另一种开始
It was just beginning.

284
00:17:11,847 --> 00:17:13,144
相信我…
Trust me...

285
00:17:13,315 --> 00:17:17,649
…只会越来越好，我带你看看真正精彩的
...it only gets better. Let me show you where the real party is.

286
00:17:22,024 --> 00:17:23,491
你纹身过没？
You ever been inked?

287
00:17:23,659 --> 00:17:25,957
我对纹身没啥兴趣
I'm not really into tattoos.

288
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:29,791
是入伙仪式，兄弟 第一次免费
Initiation, bro. First one's on the house.

289
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,661
还是算了吧，好像永远洗不掉
I don't know, man, they're kind of forever.

290
00:17:32,835 --> 00:17:37,738
- 你想成为大人物？ - 那就要像大人物一样
-You wanna eat with the big dogs? -You got to step up to the bowl.

291
00:17:39,441 --> 00:17:43,673
你绝对从没见过这玩意
This is like nothing you've ever seen before.

292
00:17:43,846 --> 00:17:47,373
我发誓，会让你觉得有如重生一般
Make you feel like a new man, swear to God.

293
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:49,779
坐吧
Have a seat.

294
00:17:54,189 --> 00:17:55,713
好的
All right.

295
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:59,327
别纹个“斯摩维尔”上去就行了
Just make sure it doesn't say "Smallville."

296
00:18:34,296 --> 00:18:36,491
哈哈，宝贝
Yeah, baby!

297
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,297
不要！不要！
No! No!

298
00:18:46,008 --> 00:18:48,499
- 嘿，拜托 - 人车合一
-Hey! Hey, come on! -Be the truck!

299
00:18:48,677 --> 00:18:52,408
- 人车合一！人车合一！ - 你们疯了吧！
-Be the truck! Be the truck! -You guys are crazy!

300
00:18:53,816 --> 00:18:55,181
不要！
No!

301
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:05,484
- 哈哈！ - 哈哈！
-Yeah! -Yeah!

302
00:19:05,661 --> 00:19:08,061
- 酷吧，宝贝！ - 酷吧！
-Yeah, baby! -Yeah!

303
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:11,795
- 看啊 - 看啊，你成功了！
-Yeah. -Yeah! You got it!

304
00:19:23,112 --> 00:19:24,204
嘿
Hey.

305
00:19:24,613 --> 00:19:27,047
你父亲打电话来说你醒了
Your dad called and told me you were awake.

306
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:30,877
恩，你确实是醒后第一位来看我的
You're officially my first visitor.

307
00:19:31,987 --> 00:19:33,852
感觉怎样？
How you feeling?

308
00:19:34,022 --> 00:19:38,152
就像被丢到洗衣机里面搅得完全虚脱一样
Like a million bucks, thrown in the washing machine and set on spin.

309
00:19:38,727 --> 00:19:42,254
- 大家都很担心你 - 看出来了
-Everyone was real worried about you. -Yeah, I noticed.

310
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:45,264
看起来好像妮尔的花店被洗劫了
Looks like Nell's flower shop's been stripped clean.

311
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:48,830
我还真喜欢莱克斯送的这束
I especially like the ones from Lex.

312
00:19:49,171 --> 00:19:52,004
让我感觉赢了肯塔基赛马大会一样
They make me feel like I won the Kentucky Derby.

313
00:19:57,079 --> 00:20:01,140
好美，这才是我最喜欢的
They're beautiful, Clark. They're my favorite.

314
00:20:02,518 --> 00:20:04,315
我…
I....

315
00:20:04,486 --> 00:20:06,920
我只想说很抱歉
I just wanna say I'm sorry.

316
00:20:09,191 --> 00:20:10,658
为什么？
For what?

317
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,326
让你受伤了
Letting you get hurt.

318
00:20:14,496 --> 00:20:17,954
我应该很恼你是不是，克拉克
Well, I am perturbed with you, Clark.

319
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:21,432
谁让你连1871年的芝加哥大火都没扑灭呢
I'm also mad that you didn't put out the Chicago Fire of 1871.

320
00:20:22,104 --> 00:20:26,006
你也没有阻止罗马帝国的衰亡 你也要为黑暗时代负直接责任是不？
Or prevent the fall of the Roman Empire, making you responsible for the Dark Ages.

321
00:20:28,677 --> 00:20:30,838
谢谢
Thanks.

322
00:20:32,781 --> 00:20:36,683
你记得当时那些人的情形么？
Do you remember anything about those guys?

323
00:20:36,852 --> 00:20:41,346
记得一件事，抓住我的人前臂上有纹身
There was one thing. The guy that grabbed me had a tattoo on his forearm.

324
00:20:42,191 --> 00:20:44,557
大概是个八角形吧
An octagon, maybe.

325
00:20:45,093 --> 00:20:48,585
- 怎么了，克拉克？ - 我不知道
-What's going on, Clark? -I don't know.

326
00:20:48,764 --> 00:20:51,289
让我去调查下
Let me do some digging.

327
00:20:51,466 --> 00:20:56,301
克拉克・肯特要做调查报导者吗 听着还挺像回事啊
Clark Kent, investigative reporter. Has a nice ring to it.

328
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:04,636
- 休息吧 - 我尽量
-You get some rest. -I'll try.

329
00:21:07,649 --> 00:21:09,981
谢谢你
Thank you.

330
00:21:13,589 --> 00:21:15,750
这个剧场对很多人来说意义重大
This theater means something to a lot of people.

331
00:21:15,924 --> 00:21:20,020
我童年时代的每个周六都在这里 就坐在第八排中间
I spent every Saturday of my childhood here, eighth row center.

332
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,595
每一次灯暗下来，屏幕闪烁起来…
When the lights went down and the screen flickered on...

333
00:21:22,764 --> 00:21:26,598
门外的一切烦恼都消失不见了
...the problems outside these doors just disappeared.

334
00:21:27,469 --> 00:21:30,563
像是被送到了一个神奇的地方
It was like being transported to a magical place.

335
00:21:30,739 --> 00:21:35,176
故事很好，可到底为何对你如此重要？
That's a nice story, but why is it so important to you really?

336
00:21:38,247 --> 00:21:43,412
我的父亲母亲在这里相遇 我想我需要一些可以留住的东西
My parents met here. I guess I'm just looking for something to hold on to.

337
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:51,591
我该只为拉娜同学的伤感回忆保留这里吗
I'm supposed to preserve this monument to Lana Lang's sentimental memories.

338
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,160
我不是这个意思
That's not what I meant.

339
00:21:54,329 --> 00:21:59,028
你还是个孩子，拉娜 别老这么突如其来情感涌动的
You're a teenager, Lana. Mercurial doesn't do you justice.

340
00:22:00,969 --> 00:22:04,769
我以为你会懂，看来我错了
Thought you might understand. Clearly I was mistaken.

341
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,771
这是生意，拉娜
This is business, Lana.

342
00:22:06,942 --> 00:22:11,402
这里所有的商店都会变成办公场所 镇上也会需要一个停车场的
All these stores are becoming office spaces. This town needs a parking garage.

343
00:22:12,648 --> 00:22:14,741
所以你要执行你的计划了
So you're going ahead with your plans.

344
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:18,317
你这种理由没法改变我的决定
You haven't given me any reason to change my mind.

345
00:22:18,987 --> 00:22:22,388
不好意思，我还有别的要紧事要办
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a pressing matter to attend to.

346
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:36,467
惠特尼，有时间吗？
Whitney, you have a minute?

347
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,801
有点忙
I'm kind of busy.

348
00:22:41,343 --> 00:22:44,005
记得昨天来找鞋那家伙吗？
Remember the guy who came in yesterday, looking for shoes?

349
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:46,773
- 不记得，光顾的人太多了 - 没跟你开玩笑，惠特尼
-No. A lot of guys come in here. -Whitney, this is serious.

350
00:22:47,749 --> 00:22:49,307
你轻点
Take it easy.

351
00:22:50,652 --> 00:22:54,486
- 你在哪儿纹的身？ - 别多管闲事
-Where'd you get that tattoo? -Mind your own business.

352
00:22:54,656 --> 00:22:57,716
是那些人给你纹的么？
Look, did those guys give it to you?

353
00:22:58,994 --> 00:23:00,928
惠特尼，他们不是好人
Whitney, they're bad news.

354
00:23:03,598 --> 00:23:08,365
你不是一直想抢走我的拉娜吗 现在怎么反倒帮起我来了？
You spend your time trying to steal Lana. Now, you wanna become my Boy Scout.

355
00:23:08,537 --> 00:23:10,698
不是这样的
That's not true.

356
00:23:10,872 --> 00:23:14,000
很难像别人看你这样看待你自己吧，肯特？
It's tough seeing yourself the way others see you, isn't it, Kent?

357
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:18,579
- 离那些人远点 - 你又不是我父亲，肯特
-Stay away from those guys. -You're not my father, Kent.

358
00:23:18,747 --> 00:23:21,682
现在就给我滚
Now, get the hell out of here.

359
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:39,859
妮尔说你打电话过来，好像很紧急
Hey. Nell said you called. Sounded urgent.

360
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:44,494
- 今天看到惠特尼了吗？ - 有，我问他昨天干嘛去了
-Have you seen Whitney today? -Yeah. I asked him what was going on.

361
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:47,471
他说他跟新朋友出去玩，放松一下
He said he was out with some new friends, blowing off steam.

362
00:23:47,642 --> 00:23:51,009
我想劝他，他却生气了，我也没办法
When I tried to press him, he got angry, so I backed off.

363
00:23:52,381 --> 00:23:57,080
看着爱人受煎熬，自己又无能为力 这种感觉真是痛苦
It's hard watching people you love suffer and there's nothing you can do to help.

364
00:23:58,153 --> 00:24:02,681
拉娜，我不知道该不该跟你说 不过惠特尼没有奖学金了
Lana, I don't know if I'm supposed to tell you this, but Whitney lost his scholarship.

365
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:05,350
什么？
What?

366
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,587
他怎么没跟我说？
Why didn't he tell me?

367
00:24:10,265 --> 00:24:14,895
梦想离他如此之近，又一瞬间被夺走
He was so close to his dream, and then to just have it taken away like that.

368
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,697
他肯定万分痛苦
Must hurt like hell.

369
00:24:17,606 --> 00:24:19,733
谢谢你告诉我
Thanks for telling me.

370
00:24:19,908 --> 00:24:22,433
你是个好朋友
You're a good friend.

371
00:24:28,183 --> 00:24:30,947
我查了下火炬报，这些是惠特尼的新朋友
<i>I raided the Torch. I think these are Whitney's new friends.</i>

372
00:24:31,953 --> 00:24:35,389
96级的韦德・马哈尼和斯科特・鲍曼
Wade Mahaney and Scott Bowman. Class of '96.

373
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:39,049
六年前，他们跟惠特尼一样
-Who are these guys? -They were Whitney, six years ago.

374
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:43,459
明星级运动员，在各种比赛中为学校得奖 他们简直可以统治学校
Athletes, lettered in football, baseball, basketball. They ruled the school.

375
00:24:44,266 --> 00:24:47,633
- 然后呢？ - 根据年鉴
<i>-What happened? -Well, according to the Ledger...</i>

376
00:24:47,803 --> 00:24:49,862
韦德受伤了，斯科特开始吸毒
...Wade got injured and Scott started using drugs.

377
00:24:50,172 --> 00:24:53,369
他们眼看着自己的未来堕落掉
They watched their futures vanish.

378
00:24:53,975 --> 00:24:57,240
- 你觉得惠特尼有麻烦了？ - 我也不知道
-Do you think Whitney's in trouble? -I don't know.

379
00:24:57,412 --> 00:25:00,973
我想跟他谈谈，但他根本不理我
I tried to talk to him, but he wouldn't listen to me.

380
00:25:01,616 --> 00:25:04,414
他觉得奖学金是离开小镇的唯一途径
He thinks that scholarship is his only way out of here.

381
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:08,283
我希望他能像我看他那样看待他自己 有太多东西比橄榄球重要
I wish he'd see himself the way I do. There's more to him than football.

382
00:25:08,457 --> 00:25:11,017
- 他很幸运有你 - 是啊
-He's lucky to have you. -Yeah.

383
00:25:11,193 --> 00:25:12,888
就是对他没什么影响力
Big influence I am.

384
00:25:13,061 --> 00:25:16,394
看来今天我就是不能说服任何人
Can't seem to convince anybody to do anything today.

385
00:25:16,565 --> 00:25:19,090
你是说塔龙剧院？
Are you talking about the Talon?

386
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:23,226
我和莱克斯见面了，本来想说服他 结果却被他打垮了
I met with Lex, tried to make my case, but he totally shot me down.

387
00:25:23,405 --> 00:25:26,966
他说我没能给他一个够好的商业理由
He said I hadn't given him a good enough business reason.

388
00:25:27,142 --> 00:25:29,007
听起来很苛刻啊
Sounds kind of harsh.

389
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:30,471
是的
Yeah.

390
00:25:30,645 --> 00:25:35,173
其实最让我抓狂的是他说的没错
But I think the thing that makes me maddest, is that he's right.

391
00:25:36,084 --> 00:25:39,815
或许他这不是拒绝，而是一个挑战
Maybe it wasn't a rejection, maybe it was a challenge.

392
00:25:39,988 --> 00:25:44,482
- 我首要的挑战是帮助惠特尼 - 那个让我来吧
-My first challenge is helping Whitney. -Let me work on that.

393
00:25:45,527 --> 00:25:49,964
克拉克，我很感激你 可你为什么要做这些？
Clark, why are you doing this? Not that I don't appreciate it.

394
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:54,830
克罗伊的事，我没能阻止 这是救惠特尼的机会
I couldn't stop what happened to Chloe. There's a chance for Whitney.

395
00:26:11,286 --> 00:26:13,277
你尝到甜头了吧？
You got a taste.

396
00:26:13,455 --> 00:26:16,720
兄弟，还想见识全部的奥妙吗？
You wanna find out what it's all about, bro?

397
00:26:16,925 --> 00:26:19,826
是的，当然，我加入
Yeah. Sure, I'm in.

398
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,978
很高兴你准点到了，莱克斯
<i>Glad you could make it, Luthor.</i>

399
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:46,553
进去，顺着走道，进一个后补式冷藏柜
<i>Go inside. You'll find a walk-in meat locker.</i>

400
00:26:46,721 --> 00:26:49,155
在那里等着
<i>Wait there.</i>

401
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,155
接下来怎么办
Now what?

402
00:27:03,104 --> 00:27:05,231
喂？
Hello?

403
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:26,084
- 你们为什么能…？ - 打开箱子，莱克斯
-How did you...? -Open the case, Lex.

404
00:27:27,362 --> 00:27:30,661
- 先给我磁盘 - 先给钱，莱克斯
-I want the disk first. -The money, Lex.

405
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,400
先把钱给我们!
Give us the money!

406
00:27:32,767 --> 00:27:34,064
- 发生什么事情了？ - 闭嘴
-What's going on? -Shut up.

407
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:46,213
箱子是空的，他玩我们！
It's empty. He screwed us!

408
00:27:46,381 --> 00:27:51,250
- 如果我把钱带来，肯定不能活着出去 - 你错了，富小子
-lf I brought the money, I'd never get out. -Big mistake, rich boy.

409
00:27:53,355 --> 00:27:56,051
我要捏断你脖子，我杀了你
I phase through your neck, I kill you.

410
00:27:57,425 --> 00:28:00,087
- 我们他妈的只想要钱！ - 住手！
-We want the damn money! -Stop it!

411
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,593
- 给我们钱！ - 你们从来没说过要做这种事情！
-Give us the money! -You never said we'd do this!

412
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,459
我让你闭嘴！
I said, shut up!

413
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,628
住手，你会杀了他！
Stop it, you're killing him!

414
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:10,734
韦德，没时间了，我们得赶快走了！
Wade, time is almost up, we got to blow!

415
00:28:10,905 --> 00:28:13,169
下次，把钱带过来！
Next time, bring the money!

416
00:28:29,658 --> 00:28:32,024
惠特尼？
Whitney?

417
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,596
走了，菜鸟
Come on, rookie.

418
00:28:48,777 --> 00:28:51,541
你怎么了，哥们？ 你在想什么呢？
What got into you, bro? What were you thinking?

419
00:28:51,713 --> 00:28:54,705
- 他根本没用脑子想！ - 我不想去杀人！
-He wasn't thinking! -I didn't sign on to kill anyone.

420
00:28:55,116 --> 00:28:56,743
是么，佛得曼？
Oh, is that it, Fordman?

421
00:28:56,918 --> 00:28:59,546
- 你想退出这个团队？ - 我没这么说，只是…
-You trying to quit? -I'm not saying that. It's just....

422
00:29:00,855 --> 00:29:04,723
莱克斯不是那种能付了钱就了事的人
Luthor doesn't seem like the kind of guy that would just pay up and then walk away.

423
00:29:04,893 --> 00:29:08,920
别担心那个卢瑟，我已经吓他个半死了
Don't worry about Luthor, I put the fear of God in him!

424
00:29:09,097 --> 00:29:11,998
那时我们会发大财的！
It's gonna be our biggest payday yet!

425
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,692
好了，好了，别这样
All right, all right, all right, that's enough.

426
00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:16,530
大家都是一伙儿的
Homeboy's fine.

427
00:29:16,705 --> 00:29:19,173
- 就是有点太紧张了吧？ - 是的
-Just had a case of jitters, didn't you? -Yeah.

428
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,035
好吧
Yeah.

429
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:30,315
- 他会把事情都搞砸了！ - 哥们，我们用那种能力已经用得精疲力尽了！
-He's gonna screw everything up! -Look at us, bro, we are burning up!

430
00:29:30,485 --> 00:29:34,819
我们不能一直由自己来纹身 得要新鲜血液来保住我们的梦想
We can't just keep tatting up. We need fresh blood to keep this dream alive.

431
00:29:36,091 --> 00:29:39,356
去喝点酒，冷静下
Now go get a brew and chill out.

432
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,927
去吧
Come on.

433
00:29:50,605 --> 00:29:52,470
哥们，听着
Listen, bro.

434
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,131
我刚才为了保你得罪好几个弟兄了
I went out on a limb for you just now.

435
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:58,609
别让我再失望
Don't let me down again.

436
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:01,447
我不会了
I won't.

437
00:30:03,351 --> 00:30:05,444
别担心那个卢瑟
And don't sweat Luthor.

438
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,919
他给了钱以后，肯定会消失…
As soon as he ponies up the cash, I think he's gonna disappear...

439
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:12,025
…很长时间的
...for a very long time.

440
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:16,363
走吧
Come on.

441
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:28,865
好吧，莱克斯…
All right, Lex...

442
00:30:29,043 --> 00:30:31,841
…你当时准备怎么对待那帮家伙？
...what were you doing with those guys?

443
00:30:34,149 --> 00:30:36,379
他们勒索我，克拉克
They were blackmailing me, Clark.

444
00:30:36,551 --> 00:30:39,349
我去交易
I went there to make a drop.

445
00:30:40,989 --> 00:30:45,050
你也怀疑你父亲对我的看法是对的了？
You're wondering if your father's been right about me all along, aren't you?

446
00:30:46,327 --> 00:30:49,455
他们偷了个装有商业机密的电脑磁盘
They stole a computer disk that contains confidential information.

447
00:30:49,631 --> 00:30:52,099
- 里面有什么？ - 并没有不合法的东西…
-What was on it? -Nothing illegal...

448
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,667
…但我也不想把这些东西公布于众
...but it's not something I want in the public domain.

449
00:30:55,069 --> 00:30:59,563
- 所以你不想让警察介入 - 克拉克，我告诉过你我能自己处理
-That's why you didn't want cops involved. -Clark, I told you I'd handle it.

450
00:30:59,741 --> 00:31:02,039
我倒想问你怎么在那？
Question is, what were you doing there?

451
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:04,035
我在跟踪惠特尼
I was following Whitney.

452
00:31:04,212 --> 00:31:06,646
他和那些人混在一起，我想帮助他
He's been hanging with those guys. I wanted to help.

453
00:31:06,815 --> 00:31:09,409
因为之前你没能救克罗伊吗？
Is this because of Chloe?

454
00:31:10,685 --> 00:31:12,710
卡拉克，你拯救不了全世界
Clark, you can't save the world.

455
00:31:12,887 --> 00:31:15,822
小心最终你的救世主情结会给你树太多敌人
All you'll end up with is a messiah complex and a lot of enemies.

456
00:31:16,524 --> 00:31:19,584
我不是救了你么？也不是很糟啊
I saved you, didn't I? That turned out all right.

457
00:31:23,264 --> 00:31:24,595
下一步行动呢？
What's your next move?

458
00:31:25,099 --> 00:31:29,229
让他们意识到抢劫莱克斯・卢瑟是没用的
They're gonna learn that it doesn't pay to rob Lex Luthor.

459
00:31:29,404 --> 00:31:31,065
惠特尼怎么办？
What about Whitney?

460
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:34,635
物以类聚
A man is measured by the quality of his friends.

461
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:38,040
如果他还和那些人在一起，就得为自己负责
If the quarterback's with them, he'll have to face the consequences.

462
00:31:57,298 --> 00:31:59,027
皮特？
Pete?

463
00:31:59,534 --> 00:32:01,593
你在这里干什么？我们说好在火炬报社见面
<i>We were supposed to meet at the Torch.</i>

464
00:32:01,769 --> 00:32:03,703
是的，但是，克罗伊打电话…
Yeah, well, Chloe called...

465
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:07,536
- …我来告诉她我们做的事情… - 所以我坚持要你们来这里…
-...and I told her what we were doing.... -So I insisted you guys come here.

466
00:32:07,709 --> 00:32:10,735
- 你应该好好休息 - 一直休息快让我疯了
-You should be resting. -All this resting is driving me insane.

467
00:32:10,912 --> 00:32:15,246
所谓的“健康护理专家”只让我躺在床上吃果冻
These so-called "health-care professionals" just want me in bed eating Jell-O.

468
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:17,316
真是法西斯啊
Those fascists.

469
00:32:19,053 --> 00:32:21,783
我也要做，不要把我排除在外，好吗？
I need to do this, okay? Don't cut me out of it, please?

470
00:32:22,123 --> 00:32:23,112
好吧
Okay.

471
00:32:23,658 --> 00:32:26,456
我上网做了一些研究…
So I was surfing the Net, doing some research....

472
00:32:26,628 --> 00:32:28,562
你在这里怎么上网？
How'd you get online here?

473
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:31,665
皮特帮我盗了电话网
Pete hijacked the phone line for me.

474
00:32:34,936 --> 00:32:35,925
有什么发现？
What have you got?

475
00:32:36,104 --> 00:32:39,596
是否有可能，那些人是利用陨石纹身来加速新陈代谢？
What if these guys are using meteorite tattoos to speed up their metabolism?

476
00:32:39,841 --> 00:32:43,436
我的意思是，他们体内的分子将会超高速运动
I mean, their molecules are literally moving at hyperspeed.

477
00:32:44,245 --> 00:32:47,806
- 这就是他们能穿过物体的原因？ - 不可思议
-That's how they go through solid objects? -That's crazy.

478
00:32:47,982 --> 00:32:50,678
可是他们做到了
Well, they're doing it.

479
00:32:51,019 --> 00:32:52,452
这就像极速冲刺
It's like the ultimate rush.

480
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:56,454
但他们的身体不能承受长时间的压力
But there's no way their bodies can handle that kind of stress for long.

481
00:32:56,624 --> 00:32:58,353
那你说时间长了会怎样？
What are you saying will happen?

482
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:01,919
要最快的速度，就要付出最大的代价
You take the ultimate rush, you pay the ultimate price.

483
00:33:10,004 --> 00:33:12,063
妮尔？
Nell?

484
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:15,475
妮尔,是你吗？
Nell, is that you?

485
00:33:23,451 --> 00:33:24,816
惠特尼
Whitney.

486
00:33:24,986 --> 00:33:27,216
我有麻烦了，拉娜
I'm in trouble, Lana.

487
00:33:27,388 --> 00:33:28,980
我把事情搞砸了
I messed up.

488
00:33:29,157 --> 00:33:30,818
我信错了人
I trusted the wrong guys.

489
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,083
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

490
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,320
我让你失望了 我只是不知道要怎么办
I let you down. I just don't know what to do.

491
00:33:36,364 --> 00:33:39,891
没事的，没事的
It's okay. It's okay.

492
00:33:49,477 --> 00:33:52,071
他们把钱拿到手之后就会杀了莱克斯…
After they get the money, they're gonna kill Lex...

493
00:33:52,246 --> 00:33:53,975
…可能也会杀了出卖他们的我
...and probably me for betraying them.

494
00:33:54,148 --> 00:33:56,912
- 你做的是对的 - 我做得太少太晚了
-You did the right thing. -Yeah, too little too late.

495
00:33:57,085 --> 00:33:58,575
他们现在在哪？
Where are they now?

496
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:02,188
回阁楼睡觉了
Back at the loft, sleeping it off.

497
00:34:02,357 --> 00:34:05,793
- 你看到他们从莱克斯那里偷的磁盘没？ - 没有
-Did you see the disk they stole from Lex? -No.

498
00:34:05,927 --> 00:34:08,259
但是一定在那里 我可以偷偷溜进去拿出来
But it's gotta be there. I can sneak in and get it.

499
00:34:08,563 --> 00:34:11,999
- 太危险了，我们还是报警吧 - 不能有警察
-It's dangerous. We should call the police. -No cops.

500
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:14,691
- 我已经有太多麻烦了 - 告诉我他们在哪里
-I'm already in enough trouble. -Tell me where they are.

501
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:19,966
- 我可以在他们醒来前拿回磁盘 - 我不能让你一个人去，克拉克
-I can get in and out before they wake. -I can't let you go alone, Clark.

502
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:23,535
是我自己惹的麻烦 我要试着去解决
I got myself into this mess, I gotta try and get myself out of it.

503
00:34:36,691 --> 00:34:38,852
没人，他们一定是出去找我了
Empty. They must be out looking for me.

504
00:34:39,027 --> 00:34:42,258
那我们得在他们回来前找到磁盘
Well, let's find it before they come back.

505
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:54,607
这儿没有
It's not here.

506
00:34:54,776 --> 00:34:58,644
继续找，一定在这儿的某个地方
Keep looking. It's gotta be here somewhere.

507
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:13,391
我找到了
I got it.

508
00:35:28,843 --> 00:35:31,607
你把事情弄糟了，菜鸟
You really screwed up, rookie.

509
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:43,012
我不管你怎么找到的磁盘 但我要你还给我，现在
Look, I don't know how you found that disk, bro, but I need it back. Now.

510
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:03,370
很疼，对吗？ 感觉像有人在你肚子里乱搅一气
Hurts, doesn't it? It feels like someone's chewing up your insides.

511
00:36:03,544 --> 00:36:07,310
如果时间够长 我还可以造成一些严重的损伤
I stay in long enough, I could do some serious damage.

512
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,893
你是下一个，兄弟
You're next, bro.

513
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,667
韦德，别这样
Wade, please.

514
00:36:35,843 --> 00:36:38,277
继续走，菜鸟
Keep moving, rookie.

515
00:36:44,652 --> 00:36:47,917
我知道在银行保险库里 你们的手臂怎么了
I know what happened to your arm in the bank vault.

516
00:36:48,856 --> 00:36:52,155
是职业损伤 时间太久纹身就会失效
Occupational hazard. We waited too long.

517
00:36:52,326 --> 00:36:55,659
不过不疼，我拔出来的时候 已经断了
Didn't hurt. When I pulled out, it was fused at the shoulder.

518
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:58,321
你们不能再这么做了，会死的
You can't keep doing this. You're gonna die.

519
00:36:58,499 --> 00:37:03,061
如果你没有搞砸我们的退休计划 我们确实不需要再这么做
If you hadn't have screwed up our retirement plan, we wouldn't have to!

520
00:37:03,237 --> 00:37:04,966
但是现在…
But now...

521
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:07,664
…你要付出代价
...you're gonna pay.

522
00:37:12,713 --> 00:37:15,011
- 你怎么找到我们的？ - 拉娜打电话来…
-How'd you find us? -Lana called...

523
00:37:15,183 --> 00:37:18,152
…告诉我你们的行踪 你应该先通知我
...told me what you guys were doing. You should've called me first.

524
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:20,617
-　我得去找惠特尼 -　克拉克，等一下
-I've gotta find Whitney. -Clark, wait.

525
00:37:20,788 --> 00:37:23,154
我这就报警
I'm calling the police.

526
00:37:33,534 --> 00:37:35,229
我本以为你懂了
I thought you understood.

527
00:37:35,403 --> 00:37:37,268
这是你重获成功的机会
This was your chance to be on top again.

528
00:37:37,438 --> 00:37:40,703
我本以为没有奖学金我的生活就完了 但是我错了
I thought my life was over when I lost my scholarship, but I was wrong.

529
00:37:40,875 --> 00:37:44,038
不，你是对的，你是完蛋了
No. You were right, your life is over.

530
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:47,781
还记得入伙仪式吗，兄弟？ 你是那么加入我们的
Remember your initiation, bro? That's how you joined us.

531
00:37:47,949 --> 00:37:52,181
你也要那样推出 时间快了，拿着遥控器
Well, that's how you're gonna leave. We're running out of time, grab the remote.

532
00:37:55,156 --> 00:37:57,249
放开他
Let him go.

533
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,559
警察马上就到
The cops are on their way.

534
00:38:06,234 --> 00:38:09,397
再好好想想，菜鸟 只有一个方法才能退出
Think again, rookie. There's only one way off this team.

535
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,162
别担心，我掩护你
Don't worry, I got you covered.

536
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:18,677
Yeah!

537
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,929
别动！
Don't move!

538
00:38:40,268 --> 00:38:43,237
- 举起手来！ - 举手!
-Keep your hands up! -Keep them up!

539
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:49,509
举起手靠在汽车上!
Up against the car!

540
00:38:55,283 --> 00:38:58,013
你怎么跟警察说的？
What did you tell the police?

541
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:00,482
事实
The truth.

542
00:39:00,888 --> 00:39:04,824
那些人闯进了我的房子 你们俩发现了，想做英雄…
Those guys broke into my house. You two figured it out, tried to be heroes...

543
00:39:04,992 --> 00:39:06,857
- …舍命来解决 - 那…？
-...and got in over your heads. -What about--?

544
00:39:07,028 --> 00:39:08,859
关于穿墙的事？
Walking through walls part?

545
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:12,591
我不认为警察能处理那么多事实
I don't think the cops could handle that much truth.

546
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:15,663
可怜了你的磁盘
Sorry about your disk.

547
00:39:16,537 --> 00:39:20,633
我来这不是为了磁盘，克拉克 我来是因为我的朋友有麻烦
I didn't come out here for that, Clark. I came because my friend was in trouble.

548
00:39:22,343 --> 00:39:24,470
谢谢
Thanks.

549
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,018
记住
Just remember, boys:

550
00:39:41,195 --> 00:39:44,631
你们为我保守秘密 我就为你们保守秘密
You keep my secret, and I'll keep yours.

551
00:39:50,938 --> 00:39:52,633
如果不帮我保密…
And if you don't...

552
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:56,106
…你们会发现自己不是唯一有穿墙超能力的人
...you'll find out you're not the only ones who can reach through walls.

553
00:39:57,712 --> 00:40:00,112
车挪开，我们要转移嫌疑人
Move this vehicle. We have to transport the suspects.

554
00:40:00,281 --> 00:40:01,441
好的
Yes, sir.

555
00:40:03,617 --> 00:40:08,054
- 啊，自由的味道 - 你只是住进了医院，不是监狱
-Ah, the sweet smell of freedom. -You were in the hospital, not Alcatraz.

556
00:40:08,222 --> 00:40:11,555
你呆一个星期也会觉得自己像个囚犯
You spend a week in there and you'd feel like a prisoner too. Come on.

557
00:40:11,726 --> 00:40:14,923
食物乏味，九点熄灯，还没电视
Bad food, lights out by nine and no cable?

558
00:40:15,096 --> 00:40:17,229
我觉得这情况需要被曝光
I'm thinking about doing an expose.

559
00:40:20,101 --> 00:40:23,366
- 顺便问问，惠特尼怎么样？ - 他得慢慢来想开
-How's Whitney, by the way? -He's taking it one day at a time.

560
00:40:23,537 --> 00:40:26,995
好的，那么，再见了
Good. All right, well, bye.

561
00:40:27,274 --> 00:40:29,936
- 噢，抱歉 - 克罗伊，你去哪？
-Oh, sorry. -Chloe, where are you going?

562
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,479
我去跟警察做些核实
I'm gonna do some checking with the police.

563
00:40:32,646 --> 00:40:34,705
阁楼里没有找到纹身液
None of the tattoo ink was found at the loft...

564
00:40:34,882 --> 00:40:37,442
…斯科特和德瑞克也没有透露任何东西，所以…
...and Scott and Derek aren't saying anything to anyone, so....

565
00:40:37,618 --> 00:40:39,176
可能有包庇隐瞒
I smell a cover-up.

566
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:41,514
克罗伊？
Chloe?

567
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,054
很高兴真正的你又回来了
It's good to have you back.

568
00:40:43,724 --> 00:40:45,783
谢谢
Thanks.

569
00:40:50,297 --> 00:40:52,060
他来早了
He's early.

570
00:40:52,433 --> 00:40:54,526
碰碰运气吧
Okay, here goes nothing.

571
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,602
这是个很好的计划
It's a good plan.

572
00:40:56,771 --> 00:40:59,365
谢谢你的帮助，祝我好运吧
Thanks for all your help. Wish me luck.

573
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,835
你不需要运气也能成功
You don't need it.

574
00:41:10,651 --> 00:41:13,245
谢谢你能来
Thanks for coming.

575
00:41:13,788 --> 00:41:15,585
接到电话我很惊讶
I was surprised by your call.

576
00:41:15,756 --> 00:41:18,657
上次见面之后 我以为你不会再找我了
After our last meeting, I didn't think I'd hear from you again.

577
00:41:18,826 --> 00:41:21,420
这次我有备而来
This time I came prepared.

578
00:41:22,863 --> 00:41:24,330
这是什么？
What's this?

579
00:41:24,832 --> 00:41:27,323
我的商业计划书
My business proposal.

580
00:41:27,501 --> 00:41:30,197
小城镇都正在复兴他们的商业区
Small towns across the country have revived their downtowns...

581
00:41:30,371 --> 00:41:33,704
…将它们恢复成以前的社会中心 他们没有…
...returning them to the social centers they once were. They didn't do this...

582
00:41:33,874 --> 00:41:36,206
…靠建造千篇一律的商场或停车场
...by building cookie-cutter malls or parking garages.

583
00:41:36,377 --> 00:41:39,505
而是重新运作已有建筑…
They did it by restoring the great buildings that were already there...

584
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,841
……将它们改造成咖啡馆，书店，餐馆
...turning them into cafes, bookstores, restaurants.

585
00:41:42,016 --> 00:41:45,247
你想让这房子变成咖啡馆或者书店？
You want to turn the Talon into a cafe/bookstore?

586
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:48,252
它也可以改造成本地乐队或者艺术电影的聚集地
It could also be a venue for local bands and arthouse movies.

587
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:51,186
在计划书的十二页写着 这栋建筑可以注册为…
I found out you can register the building...

588
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:54,589
…历史遗迹，这样还可以少收税
...as a historic landmark, which gives you certain tax benefits.

589
00:41:55,196 --> 00:41:58,597
不过千万别让我解释详细原因
Just don't ask me to explain them.

590
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,391
谁来负责这个？
Who's gonna manage it?

591
00:42:01,569 --> 00:42:03,662
妮尔说她会感兴趣的
Nell said she'd be interested.

592
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:07,865
我可以在放学后和她一起培训 争取暑假内就开张营业
And I can train with her after school, and try running it myself in the summers.

593
00:42:08,042 --> 00:42:10,772
你怎么想到这个的？
How'd you come up with this?

594
00:42:11,045 --> 00:42:14,276
克拉克给了一些建议 他告诉我你喜欢给别人挑战
Something Clark said. He told me you like to challenge people.

595
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:16,973
那么，显然你准备接受挑战了
Well, you've definitely risen to the challenge.

596
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,813
成交了？
So it's a deal?

597
00:42:19,987 --> 00:42:23,684
我需要再检查下细节，不过…
I need to look over everything but, yeah...

598
00:42:23,858 --> 00:42:26,122
- …成交了 - 真的吗？
-...it's a deal. -Really?

599
00:42:26,927 --> 00:42:28,155
真的
Really.

600
00:42:28,329 --> 00:42:32,322
我觉得这会是一段有趣合作的开始
I think this could be the start of a very interesting partnership.
