Justin.

5
00:00:25,319 --> 00:00:27,844
I just thought I'd stop by and say goodbye.

6
00:00:28,022 --> 00:00:31,753
I heard you were going back to Smallville tomorrow.

7
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,290
Yeah, Smallville.

8
00:00:36,564 --> 00:00:37,963
How's it going?

9
00:00:46,807 --> 00:00:48,741
You tell me.

10
00:00:50,277 --> 00:00:53,576
You've been here five months. You've come a long way.

11
00:00:53,748 --> 00:00:55,841
Your body has done a lot of healing.

12
00:00:56,384 --> 00:00:59,046
Except for my hands.

13
00:01:00,855 --> 00:01:03,289
They'll never get better and I'll never draw again...

14
00:01:03,457 --> 00:01:06,517
...and that's the only thing I was ever good at.

15
00:01:06,694 --> 00:01:11,529
You suffer severe nerve damage. It's lucky you have movement in your hands.

16
00:01:11,699 --> 00:01:14,463
-I did everything I could, you know that. -Really?

17
00:01:14,635 --> 00:01:19,299
Is that what you told the five patients who filed malpractice suits against you?

18
00:01:19,473 --> 00:01:22,567
Now, I can understand your still being angry...

19
00:01:22,743 --> 00:01:25,177
...but blaming me isn't gonna change your condition.

20
00:01:25,346 --> 00:01:28,543
You were in an accident and you have to accept that.

21
00:01:28,716 --> 00:01:30,877
I was in a hit-and-run.

22
00:01:32,353 --> 00:01:36,346
You know, when I was your age, I wanted to be a violinist.

23
00:01:36,524 --> 00:01:40,858
So I applied to the Conservatory, but I failed the audition.

24
00:01:41,028 --> 00:01:44,691
The instructor told me that I had the hands of a surgeon...

25
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,859
...and that's why I moved into medicine.

26
00:01:48,035 --> 00:01:50,265
As one door closes...

27
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:53,271
...another one opens.

28
00:01:53,707 --> 00:01:57,108
You're young, you'll find something new.

29
00:01:58,646 --> 00:02:01,012
Goodbye, Justin.

30
00:02:05,453 --> 00:02:07,751
Have a nice life, Dr. Wells.

31
00:02:10,324 --> 00:02:13,350
Rene, honey, I'm sorry.

32
00:02:13,527 --> 00:02:16,826
-Another ungrateful patient? -Aren't they all?

33
00:02:16,997 --> 00:02:20,990
-So you think he'll sue? -He doesn't have any proof.

34
00:02:21,168 --> 00:02:25,104
He's alive, he should be thanking me.

35
00:02:35,816 --> 00:02:37,477
What's going on?

36
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:50,694

37

38

Get us out of here now. Get us out of here now! Hurry up! Come on!

39

除了我的手

它们不能恢复了 我也不能再画画…

75

…而画画是我唯一的特长

76

…但是责备我也不会改变你的现状

81

95

他活着，就应该谢我

96
00:02:35,816 --> 00:02:37,477

是我做错了，但克罗伊干嘛这么激动？
I know I screwed up, but why is Chloe having a breakdown?

150
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:59,968
- 你真不会观察人啊 - 这话什么意思？
-You're not the most observant person. -What are you talking about?

151
00:07:00,147 --> 00:07:05,278
她想跟你单独呆一天，没有拉娜和莱克斯 她想跟你去春季舞会
She wanted to spend a day with you. She was gonna ask you to the spring formal.

152
00:07:05,452 --> 00:07:07,283
是，但是那有点像…
Yeah, but that'd be like....

153
00:07:07,454 --> 00:07:09,445
约会？
Date?

154
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:14,222
也许你摘下盯着拉娜的眼罩 你会发现克罗伊喜欢你
Maybe if you took off your Lana blinders, you'd realize Chloe likes you.

155
00:07:21,869 --> 00:07:24,394
克拉克，我没兴趣听你道歉
Clark, I'm not interested in an apology.

156
00:07:24,571 --> 00:07:27,802
- 不是我想像中的欢迎，嗨 - 嘿！
-Not the welcome I was expecting, hi. -Hey!

157
00:07:27,975 --> 00:07:30,569
你还好吗？真高兴见到你 你什么时候回来的？
How are you? It's good to see you. When did you get back?

158
00:07:30,744 --> 00:07:35,181
昨天，我只是顺道过来 谢谢你发给我那些邮件
Yesterday. I just wanted to thank you, by the way, for sending all those emails.

159
00:07:35,349 --> 00:07:39,945
- 它们陪我走过了那段困难时期 - 我相信很多人都有跟你保持联系吧
-They got me through a tough time. -I'm sure lots of people kept in touch.

160
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,385
其实我多数朋友不见面就不会想起我
For most of my friends, it was out of sight, out of mind.

161
00:07:43,557 --> 00:07:46,890
我知道那种感觉 那么你什么时候重新开始画卡通？
I know the feeling. So when can you start drawing your cartoon again?

162
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:51,463
大家都在期待火光鸟的更多冒险
Everybody's been waiting for the further adventures of the flaming crow's feet.

163
00:07:55,836 --> 00:07:58,134
不幸的是我的手恐怕不行了
Unfortunately my drawing hand's kind of shot.

164
00:07:58,972 --> 00:08:01,998
- 噢，抱歉 - 没关系
-Oh, I'm sorry. -It's okay.

165
00:08:02,476 --> 00:08:05,968
我正在重新评估我的未来
I'm in the process of re-evaluating my life.

166
00:08:08,081 --> 00:08:12,381
听着，我可不可以请你喝杯咖啡…
So listen, is there any chance that maybe I could buy you a cup of coffee...

167
00:08:12,553 --> 00:08:16,045
…或者你喜欢的那种脱脂无泡拿铁？
...or one of those nonfat, no-foam lattes that you like?

168
00:08:20,227 --> 00:08:24,891
好啊，为什么不呢？ 我也在重新评估我的未来
Yeah, why not? I'm in the process of re-evaluating my life too.

169
00:08:29,436 --> 00:08:30,801
我们走
Let's go.

170
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,201
（莉莉安・卢瑟 爱妻与慈母，1951-1993年）

171
00:08:57,364 --> 00:08:59,355
你在这里干什么？
What are you doing here?

172
00:09:01,568 --> 00:09:05,095
我来这的原因跟你一样
I'm here for the same reason you are.

173
00:09:06,073 --> 00:09:10,703
- 今天是她的忌日 - 九年了
-The anniversary of her death. -It's been nine years.

174
00:09:11,178 --> 00:09:13,339
为什么突然多愁善感了？
Why the sudden burst of sentimentality?

175
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,342
我应得的，该从你的生活中消失
I deserve that, just disappearing from your life.

176
00:09:16,517 --> 00:09:19,611
我相信我母亲在卢瑟集团的股份 也帮你做了决定
I'm sure all that LuthorCorp stock my mother left you helped.

177
00:09:19,786 --> 00:09:22,414
是你父亲这样告诉你的？
Is that what your father told you?

178
00:09:23,891 --> 00:09:26,621
那些年我曾经以为你爱我
All those years I thought you loved me.

179
00:09:28,362 --> 00:09:30,694
原来你只是为了钱
But you were just in it for the money.

180
00:09:32,499 --> 00:09:37,596
我知道你很生气，你有权利生气 但我们得谈谈
I know you're angry and you have every right to be, but we need to talk.

181
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,903
我相信，我对你要说的完全没兴趣
I can't believe there's anything you'd say that would interest me.

182
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:47,770
再见，帕梅拉
Goodbye, Pamela.

183
00:09:56,523 --> 00:09:58,047
这是我最喜欢的连环漫画之一
This one's my favorite strip.

184
00:09:58,225 --> 00:09:59,783
- 真的吗 - 是的
-Really. -Yes.

185
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,359
嗨，两位
Hey, guys.

186
00:10:01,528 --> 00:10:03,257
- 嗨 - 你认识的贾斯丁
-Hey. -You know Justin.

187
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:06,729
当然，欢迎回来，感觉怎么样
Yeah. Of course, welcome back. How are you feeling?

188
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,961
就是逐渐去适应它
Oh, just kind of taking it one day at a time.

189
00:10:11,772 --> 00:10:13,603
他们找到撞到你的司机了没？
Did they find the driver who hit you?

190
00:10:13,774 --> 00:10:17,835
没有，我能给警察的线索也不多 很长时间以来我都毫无印象
No. No, I couldn't give the police much. I didn't remember anything for a long time.

191
00:10:18,211 --> 00:10:20,338
你记起什么了吗？
Well, what do you remember?

192
00:10:21,014 --> 00:10:24,677
- 一小部分，记得车牌是DDI. - 我们应该从这部分着手调查
-A little bit of the license plate. DDI. -Well, we should look into it.

193
00:10:24,851 --> 00:10:27,752
- 打电话给警察 - 如果我们找到些线索，就会给警方的
-Call the police. -lf we find something, we'll pass it on.

194
00:10:31,658 --> 00:10:33,216
好
Okay.

195
00:10:35,262 --> 00:10:38,527
好了，我刚和莱克斯谈论过了 他给我们留了两张记者大会的票
Anyway, I talked to Lex. He scored us two tickets to the conference.

196
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:42,096
别担心，贾斯丁已经报名了 所以我可以作为他的伴一起去
Don't worry about it. Justin's signed up so I'm going as his guest.

197
00:10:42,369 --> 00:10:44,860
- 或许我们大家都可以一起去 - 不必了
-Yeah, or we could all go together. -No.

198
00:10:45,939 --> 00:10:48,908
反正克拉克对新闻业一点也没有兴趣
Clark's not that interested in journalism anyway.

199
00:10:51,244 --> 00:10:54,975
好的，我也应该走了，听着…
Right, okay. I should probably get going, listen--

200
00:11:07,394 --> 00:11:09,157
谢谢
Thank you.

201
00:11:17,504 --> 00:11:19,699
- 嗨 - 嗨，克拉克，你妈妈在家吗?
-Hi. -Hey, Clark. Is your mom around?

202
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,199
（下楼时，医生在意外事故中失去双手）

203
00:11:07,394 --> 00:11:09,157
谢谢

204
00:11:17,504 --> 00:11:19,699
- 嗨 - 嘿，克拉克，你妈妈在吗？

205
00:11:19,873 --> 00:11:23,570
- 我想订购一些馅饼 - 她在上课，我来帮你
-I wanted to order more of her pies. -She's in class, I can help you.

206
00:11:23,744 --> 00:11:26,804
我还以为你会帮克罗伊校对最终版本
I thought you'd be helping Chloe proof the latest edition.

207
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,347
- 有人帮她了 - 你俩还在冷战？
-She had enough help. -Are you two still fighting?

208
00:11:30,517 --> 00:11:32,417
谁说我们在冷战？
Who said we were fighting?

209
00:11:32,586 --> 00:11:37,523
我昨天在实习会上看到，你们俩到底怎么了？
Kind of caught it yesterday at the career fair. What's going on with you two?

210
00:11:39,192 --> 00:11:40,853
克罗伊喜欢我
Chloe likes me.

211
00:11:41,995 --> 00:11:44,088
那你对她感觉是怎样？
So how do you feel about her?

212
00:11:45,198 --> 00:11:47,792
感觉也有点超过了朋友界限
Like maybe we could be more than friends.

213
00:11:50,137 --> 00:11:53,629
- 我看到她和贾斯丁在一起，我有点… - 吃醋？
-I saw her with Justin. I got kind of-- -Jealous?

214
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:58,666
就好像突然发现了答案 然后一切感觉都因此改变了
It's like you find out this secret and it colors everything.

215
00:11:59,513 --> 00:12:02,004
我不敢相信以前居然没发现
Just can't believe I never saw it before.

216
00:12:02,482 --> 00:12:07,181
有时最适合你的人就在你的眼前 但你却往往不能发现
Sometimes the right person can be in front of your eyes and you never know.

217
00:12:15,696 --> 00:12:19,792
- 你要多少馅饼？ - 一打
-So how many pies did you want? -A dozen.

218
00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:25,261
惠特尼怎么样啦？我听说他的父亲感觉好多了
How's Whitney? I hear his dad's feeling better.

219
00:12:26,206 --> 00:12:28,197
他很好
He's great.

220
00:12:29,776 --> 00:12:31,403
一切都很好吗？
Everything okay?

221
00:12:32,646 --> 00:12:34,079
从来没这么好
Never better.

222
00:12:37,284 --> 00:12:40,651
好运，我希望你和克罗伊的事顺利
Good luck. I hope things work out with Chloe.

223
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:43,913
我也是
Me too.

224
00:12:44,491 --> 00:12:45,890
再见
Bye.

225
00:13:14,521 --> 00:13:16,148
该死
Damn it.

226
00:14:03,503 --> 00:14:05,368
皮特
Pete.

227
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:07,632
- 嗨 - 嗨，看到克罗伊了没？
-Hey. -Hey, you seen Chloe?

228
00:14:07,808 --> 00:14:11,437
英文课后就没见到， 她可能和贾斯丁在一起
Not since English. She's probably hanging out with Justin.

229
00:14:12,979 --> 00:14:16,745
- 你觉得那家伙怎么样？ - 他看起来相当酷
-What do you think about that guy? -He seems pretty cool.

230
00:14:16,917 --> 00:14:21,081
以前跟他不熟，他老是埋头画画
Never got to know him that well before, he was always buried in a sketchpad.

231
00:14:21,254 --> 00:14:23,119
克罗伊似乎也喜欢他
Chloe seems to like him.

232
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,622
小心一点，克拉克，你听起来有点吃醋啊
Careful, Clark, you almost sound a little jealous.

233
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:27,953
我不是吃醋，我只是关心
I'm not jealous, I'm concerned.

234
00:14:28,128 --> 00:14:31,325
为什么，只是因为克罗伊喜欢上了一个好男生？ 这也使我很担忧啊
Why, because Chloe's falling for a nice guy? It's got me worried too.

235
00:14:31,498 --> 00:14:32,829
看
Look.

236
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:36,400
昨天贾斯丁的档案袋里放着这个
Justin had this in his portfolio yesterday.

237
00:14:37,771 --> 00:14:41,673
下楼时，医生因意外事故失去双手
"Going Down. Doctor Loses Hands in Freak Accident."

238
00:14:41,842 --> 00:14:44,709
- 那又怎么样 - 那就是贾斯丁的医生
-So? -That was Justin's doctor.

239
00:14:45,212 --> 00:14:47,339
他带着这种剪报，你不觉得奇怪吗？
Don't you think it's weird he's carrying that?

240
00:14:47,848 --> 00:14:50,373
我喜欢收集讽刺性的悲剧意外
I liked the tragic irony.

241
00:14:51,418 --> 00:14:53,579
你总喜欢在背后说别人坏话？
You always talk about people behind their backs?

242
00:14:53,753 --> 00:14:55,653
- 贾斯丁，我不是这个意思… - 是的，你就是
-Justin, I didn't mean-- -Yes, you did.

243
00:14:55,822 --> 00:15:00,555
我刚开始和克罗伊呆在一起 你就注意到了她的存在，然后想我退出吗？
I start spending time with Chloe, suddenly you realize she exists and want me out?

244
00:15:00,727 --> 00:15:04,629
- 克罗伊和我只是朋友 - 你本来有机会和她在一起的
-Chloe and I are just friends. -You had your chance with her.

245
00:15:05,131 --> 00:15:07,463
现在该把机会给我了
Now you let me have mine.

246
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,318
你究竟在这干嘛
What the hell are you doing here?

247
00:15:30,957 --> 00:15:34,449
我想看看你会成长为什么样的人
I wanted to see what kind of young man you'd grown into.

248
00:15:34,628 --> 00:15:36,528
一个很忙的人
A very busy one.

249
00:15:37,664 --> 00:15:39,256
那如果没别的事…
So if there's nothing else--

250
00:15:39,432 --> 00:15:43,459
我们曾经很亲密，亚历山大（莱克斯名字） 你以前就像我的儿子一样
We were close once, Alexander, you were like a son to me.

251
00:15:43,637 --> 00:15:46,367
你只是个雇员，你领薪水来照顾我
You were an employee. You were paid to watch me while...

252
00:15:46,539 --> 00:15:50,976
因为我母亲生病，我父亲为事业全世界到处跑
...my mother's health failed and my father crisscrossed the globe on business.

253
00:15:51,177 --> 00:15:53,441
我爱你像爱我自己的儿子一样
I loved you like my own.

254
00:15:53,613 --> 00:15:58,516
流星雨事件过后，我是唯一没把你当异类的人
After the meteor shower, I was the one who never looked at you differently.

255
00:15:59,853 --> 00:16:02,287
就算你曾在低谷时支持过我
Just because you knew me at a vulnerable point...

256
00:16:02,455 --> 00:16:05,322
也没有权力在离开十年后再走入我的生活
...doesn't give you the right to waltz back in a decade later.

257
00:16:06,426 --> 00:16:11,887
一切都变了，我变了，你想从我这得到什么？
Things have changed. I've changed. What do you want from me?

258
00:16:12,065 --> 00:16:14,693
我想让你知道究竟发生了什么？
I want you to know what really happened.

259
00:16:15,902 --> 00:16:19,497
- 你违背了对我母亲临终前的誓言 - 不，我没有
-You lied to my mother on her deathbed. -No, I didn't.

260
00:16:19,673 --> 00:16:23,165
我很想留下来，但你父亲把我赶走了
I had every intention of staying, but your father sent me away.

261
00:16:23,343 --> 00:16:26,835
葬礼过后，他把我叫到他的办公室，告诉我
After the funeral, he called me into his office and told me...

262
00:16:27,013 --> 00:16:31,006
如果我再跟你联系，他会剥夺你的继承权
...if I ever had contact with you again that he would disinherit you.

263
00:16:31,184 --> 00:16:32,674
他为什么要这么做？
Why would he do that?

264
00:16:32,852 --> 00:16:36,583
因为他想让你变得像他，而不是像她
Because he wanted you to be his son, not hers.

265
00:16:36,756 --> 00:16:38,815
那你现在又为什么出现？
So why show up now?

266
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:44,121
我父亲的威胁时效到期了吗？
Does the statute of limitations on my father's threat expire?

267
00:16:45,699 --> 00:16:48,395
我想知道，是否无论莱诺如何影响你
I needed to see if you'd found a way to be true to yourself...

268
00:16:48,568 --> 00:16:50,934
你依然能坚持自己的路
...in spite of Lionel's efforts.

269
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,776
而且老实说，我想得到你的原谅
And to be honest, I wanted your forgiveness.

270
00:17:02,115 --> 00:17:06,211
那恐怕你自己都很难相信吧
I'm afraid you'll have to find a way to grant it to yourself.

271
00:17:10,957 --> 00:17:13,084
再见，亚历山大
Goodbye, Alexander.

272
00:17:25,138 --> 00:17:28,232
我希望店里的东西 都像你母亲的有机苹果馅饼一样卖得畅销
I wish everything sold as well as your mom's organic apple pies.

273
00:17:28,408 --> 00:17:31,502
- 滴水汇成河 - 嗨，克拉克
-Every little bit helps. -Hey, Clark.

274
00:17:31,678 --> 00:17:36,706
- 嗨，惠特尼，你父亲怎么样了？ - 在好转中，回家真开心
-Hey, Whitney, how's your dad? -On the mend. Happy to be home.

275
00:17:37,684 --> 00:17:39,584
嗨，把周六晚上腾空出来
Hey. Keep Saturday night free.

276
00:17:39,753 --> 00:17:42,381
我有两张在大都会剧场上映的 《我们的小镇》的戏票
<i>Got two tickets to Our Town at the Metropolis Playhouse.</i>

277
00:17:42,889 --> 00:17:47,258
- 哇，怎么突然想到买的 - 看见你在学校看海报
-Wow. What inspired you to do that? -Saw you reading it at school.

278
00:17:47,427 --> 00:17:50,191
我想弥补一些我们之间错过的时间
Thought I might start making up for some lost time.

279
00:17:52,365 --> 00:17:55,129
- 再见 - 再见
-See you. -Bye.

280
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:05,038
惠特尼在过去的两个礼拜 比以往一整年都更加关注我
Whitney has paid more attention to me in the last two weeks than he has all year.

281
00:18:05,211 --> 00:18:07,202
你跟他沟通过了吗？
Have you talked to him about it?

282
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,948
他父亲好转后，他开心多了
He's seemed so happy ever since his dad got better.

283
00:18:10,116 --> 00:18:14,052
- 他想把我们错失的快乐都找回来 - 那你觉得呢？
-He wants to pick up where we left off. -How do you feel about that?

284
00:18:15,321 --> 00:18:18,017
佛得曼先生病了之后，惠特尼就很需要我
After Mr. Fordman got sick, Whitney needed me.

285
00:18:18,191 --> 00:18:22,821
那时我们的关系有点被重新定位了 现在又得再定位回去
Kind of defined our relationship. Now we need to redefine it.

286
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:25,190
需要重新定位的关系很多
There's a lot of that going on.

287
00:18:26,066 --> 00:18:30,025
- 你和克罗伊那边怎么样？ - 还拖着呢
-How are things with Chloe? -Unresolved.

288
00:18:31,171 --> 00:18:33,139
你要怎么做？
What are you gonna do?

289
00:18:33,306 --> 00:18:37,208
没想好，我怕和她交往不成 会连朋友也不能再做
I don't know, just don't want to lose a friend in the process.

290
00:18:37,377 --> 00:18:40,210
一旦越过那条界限，就没法再回头
Once you've crossed that line, you can't go back.

291
00:18:41,815 --> 00:18:46,377
克罗伊也跟我说过这句话 不过那时我们在讨论另一个人
Chloe gave that same advice about someone else.

292
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,211
后来怎么样了？
What happened?

293
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:54,884
- 我决定和那个人保持朋友关系 - 你后悔过那样的决定吗？
-Decided to stay friends. -Do you regret that decision?

294
00:18:56,229 --> 00:19:01,633
是的，我让某一刻溜走，再也找不回
Yeah. I let that moment slip away and I don't think I'll ever get it back.

295
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:05,936
这次我不想在克罗伊身上犯同样的错误
I don't want to make that same mistake twice.

296
00:19:16,216 --> 00:19:20,380
我刚才把你想起的肇事车那部分车牌号
Hey. I just emailed the partial license plate details of your hit-and-run...

297
00:19:20,553 --> 00:19:24,011
邮件给我在车管局的线人，让他查查本郡的车
...to my contact at the DMV. I told him to start with cars in the county.

298
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:27,682
他说有了消息就会传真给我
He said that he would fax me whatever information he found.

299
00:19:28,328 --> 00:19:29,920
哇
Wow.

300
00:19:31,931 --> 00:19:34,900
送给你，这个花了我一整夜时间
Oh, here, it took me all night.

301
00:19:39,472 --> 00:19:41,303
噢，哇
Oh, wow.

302
00:19:42,742 --> 00:19:46,508
- 真好看 - 你也是
-It's beautiful. -Well, so are you.

303
00:19:49,215 --> 00:19:53,208
你知道吗，那辆车撞了我之后 我躺在路上…
Did you know that after that car hit me and I was lying in the road...

304
00:19:53,386 --> 00:19:58,016
- 脑子里都是你的样子 - 我？为什么是我？
-...I kept picturing your face? -Me? Why me?

305
00:19:59,058 --> 00:20:01,549
因为我一直非常喜欢你
Because I always had the biggest crush on you.

306
00:20:01,728 --> 00:20:06,665
可是我没勇气表白 后来那时我以为自己快死了
And I was too afraid to do anything. I thought, here I am about to die...

307
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:10,166
永远也没机会说出口了
...and I'm never gonna get the chance to tell her how I feel.

308
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:14,501
但后来在医院里，你又发邮件给我
But when you started emailing me when I was in the hospital...

309
00:20:15,608 --> 00:20:20,875
我感觉到那是我的第二次机会 我不能再放弃你
...I knew that this was my chance and I wasn't going to let you get away twice.

310
00:20:25,618 --> 00:20:28,086
我坚持抗争都是为了你
I fought my way back for you.

311
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,685
出什么事了？
What just happened?

312
00:21:03,756 --> 00:21:06,691
- 你愿意开放思维听我说吗？ - 当然
-Can you keep an open mind? -Sure.

313
00:21:07,627 --> 00:21:09,822
事故过后我出了点事
Something happened to me after the accident...

314
00:21:09,996 --> 00:21:13,454
在医院时，我发现自己可以凭意念…
...and when I was in the hospital I found that I could move things.

315
00:21:14,634 --> 00:21:17,797
- 使物品移动 - 摄神取物那类的？
-With my mind. -Like telekinesis?

316
00:21:19,405 --> 00:21:21,566
把你吓着了吗？
Am I freaking you out?

317
00:21:22,475 --> 00:21:25,808
信不信由你，比这更怪的事我也见过
Believe it or not, I have seen stranger things.

318
00:21:25,979 --> 00:21:29,745
因为我不想被你放到“怪异之墙”上
Because I don't want to end up on your wall.

319
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:35,786
别担心，不会的 我们再让东西飘起来好不好
Don't worry, you won't. Now, let's make everything float again.

320
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,127
嘿，克罗伊，我能…？
Hey, Chloe, can l--?

321
00:21:48,568 --> 00:21:52,766
- 能不能到外面和你谈谈？ - 当然，好，克拉克
-Can I talk to you outside for a second? -Yeah, sure, Clark.

322
00:21:52,939 --> 00:21:55,271
- 我很快回来 - 好的
-I'll be right back. -Okay.

323
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,200
（找到相符车牌）

324
00:22:14,961 --> 00:22:17,896
你不觉得你和贾斯丁进展太快点了？
Don't you think this Justin thing is moving a little too fast?

325
00:22:18,064 --> 00:22:22,433
我们互通邮件六个月了 我对他比对你了解都多
We've been emailing for six months. I know him better than I know you.

326
00:22:23,236 --> 00:22:25,670
- 他跟你说过他医生发生的事吗？ - 没有
-Did he say what happened to his doctor? -No.

327
00:22:26,172 --> 00:22:29,403
他倒是说过你在背后对他说三道四
But he did tell me that you were talking about him behind his back.

328
00:22:29,575 --> 00:22:32,976
- 我只是想照看你，克罗伊 - 你这是怎么了，克拉克？
-I was just looking out for you, Chloe. -What's with you, Clark?

329
00:22:33,146 --> 00:22:34,807
你是不是有什么救世主情结啊？
Do you have some savior complex?

330
00:22:34,981 --> 00:22:39,441
我有危险你就来救我，但其他时候你就正眼也不看我
If I'm in trouble you'll rescue me. Other than that you're emotionally unavailable.

331
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:43,111
我只是不希望你因为生我的气 才和贾斯丁搅合在一起
I just don't want you getting involved with Justin because you're mad at me.

332
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:46,554
你爱信不信，克拉克，我的世界不是全围着你转
Believe it or not, Clark, my world does not revolve around you.

333
00:22:46,726 --> 00:22:49,354
你为何就不能接受，我已经找到一个特别的人
Why can't you accept that I've found someone special...

334
00:22:49,529 --> 00:22:52,828
而且不像你，我愿意为爱冒险
...and unlike you, I'm willing to take a chance?

335
00:23:20,593 --> 00:23:25,428
告诉我，欺骗大家很容易吗？
Just tell me one thing, was it easy to lie to everybody?

336
00:23:25,898 --> 00:23:31,165
- 贾斯丁，你在这做什么？ - 回想一些忘记的事
-Justin? What are you doing here? -Reliving old memories.

337
00:23:31,704 --> 00:23:33,865
你该回家了
I think you should go home.

338
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:42,470
我过马路时只走了一半，就被你的车冲倒
I was only halfway across the crosswalk when your car came barreling around.

339
00:23:43,249 --> 00:23:45,717
撞得太严重了，我简直觉得自己裂成了两半
Hit me so hard, it felt like I'd been broken in half.

340
00:23:46,185 --> 00:23:48,415
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

341
00:23:50,757 --> 00:23:53,920
我还记得自己躺在街上，血滴进眼睛
I remember lying in the street, blood dripping into my eyes...

342
00:23:54,093 --> 00:23:58,792
看着你的尾灯渐行渐远 你根本没有费心停下来看看
...watching your taillights disappear. You didn't even bother to stop.

343
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,265
不是我
It wasn't me.

344
00:24:11,411 --> 00:24:13,276
我从在医院里就能这样了
It started in the hospital.

345
00:24:13,446 --> 00:24:17,780
得到这种超能力，算是弥补我双手失去的力量
Maybe as a way to compensate for the motor skills I'd lost in my hands.

346
00:24:19,051 --> 00:24:21,485
我当时全身都被固定
I was immobilized in a total body cast.

347
00:24:21,654 --> 00:24:24,555
然后突然发现自己凭意念就可以移动物体
Then I found that I could move things just by thinking.

348
00:24:35,067 --> 00:24:37,627
可这样也不能真正补偿我所失去的
But that didn't replace what I'd lost.

349
00:24:39,205 --> 00:24:41,799
没有任何事可以取代我的画
Because nothing could ever do that.

350
00:24:48,281 --> 00:24:50,408
贾斯丁，停手！
Justin, stop it!

351
00:24:50,783 --> 00:24:55,379
你知道被2000磅的车撞到是什么滋味吗？
Do you know what it feels like to be hit by a 2000-pound car?

352
00:25:26,152 --> 00:25:28,313
嘿，莱克斯，这么晚来干嘛？
Hey, Lex, what are you doing here so late?

353
00:25:20,313 --> 00:25:22,000
（男人来自火星，女人来自金星）

354
00:25:28,488 --> 00:25:32,015
和你父母谈谈补偿的问题，你在读什么？
Came to talk to your parents about the settlement. What are you reading?

355
00:25:38,264 --> 00:25:40,255
男人来自金星，女人来自火星？
<i>Men are From Mars, Women are From Venus?</i>

356
00:25:40,433 --> 00:25:43,459
我是想了解一下女生的心理
I'm trying to get an insight into the female psyche.

357
00:25:43,636 --> 00:25:48,437
我很怀疑你看书就能了解她们，有什么问题了？
I seriously doubt you'll find it in here. What's the problem?

358
00:25:49,575 --> 00:25:53,306
我有两个很棒的朋友，偏偏都是女孩
I've got these two amazing friends who both happen to be girls.

359
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,416
为方便讨论起见 我们就把她们称为拉娜和克罗伊吧
For argument's sake, let's call them Lana and Chloe.

360
00:25:59,085 --> 00:26:02,714
我一直喜欢拉娜，但我没法接近她
I've always liked Lana, but I could never get near her.

361
00:26:03,122 --> 00:26:06,114
我发现克罗伊喜欢我，我好像也对她有感觉
I found out that Chloe likes me, I may have feelings for her too.

362
00:26:06,292 --> 00:26:07,759
你现在想追哪一个？
Which one do you want to pursue?

363
00:26:07,927 --> 00:26:10,259
我想保护好两边的友谊
I want to protect my friendship with both.

364
00:26:10,429 --> 00:26:12,897
那你哪个也追不到了
Then you'll never get either one.

365
00:26:13,966 --> 00:26:17,561
多谢了，我还是回头看书吧
Thanks. Think I'll stick with the book.

366
00:26:17,737 --> 00:26:21,229
克拉克，爱本来就不是安全的 想爱就要冒险
Clark, love isn't about playing it safe, it's about risks.

367
00:26:21,407 --> 00:26:24,308
不想冒险，也就不会知道结果
Unless you put yourself out there, you'll never know.

368
00:26:24,477 --> 00:26:28,971
- 你曾经爱过吗？ - 我这辈子只爱过两个女人
-Have you ever been in love before? -I've only loved two women in my life.

369
00:26:29,148 --> 00:26:33,141
- 一个已经死了，另一个又背叛了我 - 很遗憾
-One died and the other betrayed me. -I'm sorry.

370
00:26:34,053 --> 00:26:36,487
有些人注定要独自活着
Some people are meant to be alone.

371
00:26:43,563 --> 00:26:48,591
- 妈，怎么了？ - 是关校长
-Mom, what is it? -It's Principal Kwan.

372
00:26:48,768 --> 00:26:51,464
他发生了事故，死了
He was killed in an accident.

373
00:26:58,644 --> 00:27:02,080
- 嘿，各位，都还好吗？ - 我依然不能相信发生了这种事
-Hey, guys. How are you holding up? -I still can't believe this happened.

374
00:27:02,248 --> 00:27:05,649
正收集悼念材料，可是要用的照片
Putting together a memorial issue but when you're looking for pictures...

375
00:27:05,818 --> 00:27:09,811
总是找不到，皮特，你能不能再查查图书馆档案？
...you never find them. Pete, can you check the library files? One more time?

376
00:27:09,989 --> 00:27:11,923
- 当然 - 谢谢
-Sure. -Thank you.

377
00:27:12,091 --> 00:27:17,586
看到关校长事故的警方报告了 车还没熄火，应该是不小心撞档了
Got Kwan's police report. His car was still on, it must have slipped into gear.

378
00:27:17,763 --> 00:27:21,494
- 克罗伊，你没事吗？ - 恩，没事
-Chloe, are you okay? -Yeah, I'm fine.

379
00:27:22,034 --> 00:27:24,468
- 这个办公室里什么都找不到！ - 让我帮忙
-I can't find anything in this office! -Let me help.

380
00:27:24,637 --> 00:27:26,571
不用，谢谢你
No, thank you.

381
00:27:30,343 --> 00:27:32,140
克罗伊，看这个
Chloe, look at this.

382
00:27:33,713 --> 00:27:37,809
关校长车牌号的前三位 和撞到贾斯丁又逃逸的那辆车一样
The first three numbers of Kwan's license plate match Justin's hit-and-run driver.

383
00:27:37,984 --> 00:27:39,576
- 那能推断出什么，克拉克？ - 那么…
-What are you getting at? -Well...

384
00:27:39,752 --> 00:27:42,186
…看起来很多奇怪的事故都和这家伙有关系
...there's a lot of weird accidents around this guy.

385
00:27:42,355 --> 00:27:45,324
克拉克，你完全是弄错人了
Clark, you are seriously barking up the wrong tree here.

386
00:27:45,491 --> 00:27:47,425
你有没有收到车管局发过来的传真啊？
Did you get a response from the DMV?

387
00:27:47,593 --> 00:27:49,720
- 没有，根本就没传过来。 - 不，那边传给你了
-No, it never came through. -Yes, you did.

388
00:27:49,895 --> 00:27:52,921
昨天下午4:43传来的 就是你和贾斯丁在这儿的那会儿
4:43 yesterday. Around the time you were here with Justin.

389
00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:55,431
- 他不可能干出这种事情 - 为什么，就因为你喜欢他？
-He couldn't have done it. -Because you like him?

390
00:27:55,601 --> 00:27:59,037
不是，因为我了解他，他不会伤害任何人
No, because I know him and I know he wouldn't hurt anyone.

391
00:28:04,977 --> 00:28:06,877
真希望你是对的
I hope you're right.

392
00:28:16,522 --> 00:28:22,392
“我庆祝我自己，歌唱我自己， 我承担的你也将承担”
"I celebrate myself and what I assume you shall assume."

393
00:28:22,561 --> 00:28:27,624
“因为属于我的每一个原子也同样属于你”
"For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you."

394
00:28:29,602 --> 00:28:32,070
听起来像是描述家庭，对吧？
Sounds like a description of family, doesn't it?

395
00:28:32,238 --> 00:28:35,730
不是我们这样的家庭，什么时候开始读诗了？
Not ours. Since when do you read poetry?

396
00:28:36,075 --> 00:28:39,977
我们要卖掉卡德摩斯实验室，莱克斯
We're selling Cadmus Labs, Lex.

397
00:28:40,479 --> 00:28:44,472
但我持有50%的股份，而且具有否决权。
Our deal memo gives me 50 percent ownership with veto rights.

398
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:47,210
这件事你还没问过我的意见
I don't recall you asking my opinion.

399
00:28:47,386 --> 00:28:49,445
我们当初买它只是为了搞垮哈里爵士的
We only bought Cadmus to bankrupt Sir Harry.

400
00:28:49,622 --> 00:28:52,921
自从我们大量转手股票之后， 那个公司已经没别的价值
After we pumped and dumped the stock, the company's worthless.

401
00:28:53,092 --> 00:28:54,923
它的使命已经完成了
It served its purpose.

402
00:28:55,227 --> 00:28:58,685
你专程来这不只为了谈卡德摩斯实验室吧
You didn't come all this way to talk about Cadmus.

403
00:28:59,632 --> 00:29:03,124
我知道帕梅拉已经回来了
I understand Pamela's back in the States.

404
00:29:03,302 --> 00:29:06,396
- 并且她也见过你了 - 那么你是来撤销我的继承权的？
-And that she paid you a visit. -Did you come to disinherit me?

405
00:29:06,672 --> 00:29:09,436
- 她这样告诉你的？ - 是不是真的？
-Is that what she told you? -Is it true?

406
00:29:10,576 --> 00:29:14,808
你妈妈是一个很不同凡响的女人
Your mother was an extraordinary woman.

407
00:29:15,147 --> 00:29:21,017
但她找助手的眼光还不够好，帕梅拉很会钻营
But her taste in help left a lot to be desired. Pamela was a hanger-on.

408
00:29:21,454 --> 00:29:24,321
她说服你妈妈把所有的股票留给她，然后…
She convinced your mother to leave her all that stock, then...

409
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:26,856
…你妈妈尸骨未寒，她就消失了
...she disappeared before the body was even cold.

410
00:29:27,293 --> 00:29:29,921
你百忙之中过来就是为了告诉我这个？
You took time out of your busy schedule to tell me that?

411
00:29:30,096 --> 00:29:35,193
我知道她对你来说很重要 但我不希望她利用感情牌…
I know how much she meant to you and I don't want her using emotional tyranny...

412
00:29:35,367 --> 00:29:37,801
- …来骗取你的钱。 - 她为什么会那么做？
-...to hit you up for money. -Why would she do that?

413
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:39,267
她已经有很多股票了啊
She's got plenty of stock.

414
00:29:39,605 --> 00:29:42,699
可能是她不想卖了它们来支付她的医疗费
Probably she doesn't want to sell it to pay her medical bills.

415
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:44,433
什么医疗费？
What medical bills?

416
00:29:45,678 --> 00:29:51,446
- 她没告诉你么，真是伟大啊 - 告诉我什么啊？
-She didn't tell you. How noble. -Tell me what?

417
00:29:52,218 --> 00:29:56,279
她快不行了，莱克斯，得了癌症
She's dying, Lex. Cancer.

418
00:29:58,424 --> 00:30:02,292
也许是这些年总在圣特罗佩晒日光浴造成的
Probably all those years sitting in the sun in Saint-Tropez.

419
00:30:05,865 --> 00:30:09,357
- 她来找你干嘛？ - 求得原谅
-What does she want? -Forgiveness.

420
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,997
那你跟她怎么说的？
And what did you tell her?

421
00:30:14,206 --> 00:30:15,969
滚出去
To get out.

422
00:30:18,177 --> 00:30:23,479
看来她对你不是很了解，我说得没错吧？
No. She doesn't know you very well, does she?

423
00:30:46,672 --> 00:30:48,640
你来这儿干嘛？
What are you doing in here?

424
00:30:48,808 --> 00:30:54,246
丹尼，对于你爸爸的事，我很遗憾
Danny, I'm really sorry about what happened to your dad.

425
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:01,716
我不明白到底怎么回事儿 车钥匙明明在他身上啊
I don't understand what happened. He had the car keys with him.

426
00:31:01,887 --> 00:31:07,052
看起来就像有什么东西推着车子， 狠狠地朝他撞了去
It's like something just smashed the car right into him.

427
00:31:09,228 --> 00:31:12,129
丹尼，你知道一个叫贾斯丁・基恩斯的人么？
Danny, did you know a Justin Gaines?

428
00:31:13,199 --> 00:31:15,463
他昨天晚上有没有来过这儿？
Do you know if he came by here last night?

429
00:31:15,634 --> 00:31:17,465
不知道，怎么了？
No, why?

430
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:22,998
我觉得贾斯丁也许认为 你父亲是他车祸的肇事人
I think Justin believes your father was responsible for the accident.

431
00:31:23,175 --> 00:31:25,735
那太扯了，你该走了
That's crazy. You should leave.

432
00:31:25,911 --> 00:31:30,041
他比对了你父亲和肇事逃跑的车牌号 结果发现有一部分是一样的
He matched part of your dad's license plate to the hit-and-run driver's.

433
00:31:40,392 --> 00:31:42,724
有没有可能贾斯丁的推断是对的？
Is there a chance Justin's right?

434
00:31:44,096 --> 00:31:46,394
我父亲不该这样没命
My dad didn't deserve this.

435
00:31:49,735 --> 00:31:53,000
你父亲不是那个肇事者，对么？
Your dad wasn't the one driving the car, was he?

436
00:31:57,643 --> 00:31:59,668
是你撞了他
You're the one who hit Justin.

437
00:32:00,045 --> 00:32:01,808
我爸爸…
My dad...

438
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:07,350
…他只是想保护我
...he was just trying to protect me.

439
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:32,206
克罗伊？
Chloe?

440
00:32:09,206 --> 00:32:10,506
（威尔士医生，贾斯丁・基恩斯）

441
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,500
（为了正义）

442
00:32:36,282 --> 00:32:39,809
- 我妈妈说你在这儿 - 哦，我本来想给你个惊喜的
-My mom said you were here. -Oh, I wanted to surprise you.

443
00:32:39,985 --> 00:32:43,853
今天一天没在学校看到你 关校长的事儿你听说了么？
I didn't see you at school today. Did you hear about Principal Kwan?

444
00:32:44,423 --> 00:32:47,517
- 听说了，真是很奇怪，对吧？ - 是啊
-I did. That's really weird, right? -Yeah.

445
00:32:47,693 --> 00:32:50,457
我想我们自己永远都想不到哪天就挂了
I guess you never know when your time's up.

446
00:32:50,629 --> 00:32:55,726
所以我们应该好好利用现有的时光
Which is why I think we should make the most of the time that we have.

447
00:32:57,736 --> 00:33:01,570
- 怎么了？ - 没什么，我给忘了，突然想起来…
-What's the matter? -Nothing. I forgot, I just remembered...

448
00:33:02,608 --> 00:33:05,509
…我约了克拉克在他家见面的
...I told Clark I'd meet him at his house.

449
00:33:06,979 --> 00:33:11,848
你已经拒绝他了 还有必要在他身上花费那么多时间么
For someone that is out of the picture, you sure spend a lot of time with him.

450
00:33:12,017 --> 00:33:16,545
别多想，今天我就是去跟他说清楚 我们俩现在的关系的
Don't worry. Today I plan on telling him exactly what's going on between us.

451
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,911
你做得很对，克拉克，说服了丹尼去自首
You did the right thing, Clark. Convincing Danny to turn himself in.

452
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,100
（读诗会，周四夜）

453
00:33:45,084 --> 00:33:49,350
- 他父亲已经死了，现在他也可能要坐牢 - 某些秘密能毁掉整个家庭啊
-His father's dead. He's going to jail. -Some secrets destroy families.

454
00:33:49,521 --> 00:33:52,581
克拉克，克罗伊的电话，她听起来吓坏了
Clark, Chloe's on the phone, she sounds really freaked out.

455
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,523
- 克罗伊，怎么了？ - 克拉克，我到处打电话找你
-Chloe, what's up? -I've been calling all over the place.

456
00:33:57,696 --> 00:34:00,460
我真是糊涂了，贾斯汀有牵连，你是对的
I really screwed up, Justin is involved, you were right.

457
00:34:00,632 --> 00:34:03,465
- 冷静点，你在哪儿？ -在你家谷仓里
<i>-Well, calm down. Where are you? -In your barn.</i>

458
00:34:03,635 --> 00:34:06,160
我之前没有对你说实话，克拉克
I haven't been completely honest with you, Clark.

459
00:34:06,338 --> 00:34:09,239
我知道贾斯丁怎么能制造这样的事故
I know how Justin caused those accidents.

460
00:34:11,543 --> 00:34:12,874
克罗伊？克罗伊！
Chloe? Chloe!

461
00:34:20,285 --> 00:34:21,946
贾斯丁？
Justin?

462
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:45,371
你怎么能背叛我？你怎么能背叛我们俩的幸福？
How could you betray me? How could you betray what we had together?

463
00:35:09,668 --> 00:35:10,999
哦，不要！
Oh, no!

464
00:35:14,807 --> 00:35:18,766
我喜欢你的就是这一点，克罗伊，你是个斗士
That's what I love about you, Chloe. You're a fighter.

465
00:35:43,335 --> 00:35:48,034
对不起，我也不想让事情这样结局
I'm sorry. I didn't want it to end like this.

466
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:03,483
- 你怎么做到的？ - 你杀错人了
-How did you do that? -You killed the wrong man.

467
00:36:03,655 --> 00:36:05,987
- 你撒谎 - 他的儿子已经自首了
-You're lying. -His son just turned himself in.

468
00:36:06,425 --> 00:36:08,916
- 他才是撞你的那个人 - 不可能
-He was the one who hit you. -That is not true!

469
00:36:09,094 --> 00:36:12,928
你说过你在乎克罗伊 你究竟想害死多少无辜的人？
You said you cared about Chloe. How many people are you willing to kill?

470
00:36:13,098 --> 00:36:14,827
多一个也不多
Just one more.

471
00:36:18,203 --> 00:36:21,138
你真应该好好把这些楼梯平台修修了，克拉克
You've really got to stick those landings, Clark.

472
00:36:22,107 --> 00:36:24,200
你赢不了的，贾斯丁
You can't win, Justin.

473
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:38,189
克罗伊，你没事儿吧？
Chloe, are you okay?

474
00:37:14,526 --> 00:37:18,826
- 真没想到你会来看我 - 为什么不早点告诉我呢？
-You're the last person I expected. -Why didn't you tell me?

475
00:37:18,997 --> 00:37:22,728
- 这跟你没关系 - 你都快不行了，还说和我没关系？
-It's not your concern. -It's not my concern that you're dying?

476
00:37:24,736 --> 00:37:29,639
- 我能帮上忙，我能帮你治疗 - 我不是来祈求你的帮助或怜悯什么的…
-I could help, I can get you treatment. -I didn't come to you for help or pity...

477
00:37:29,808 --> 00:37:33,437
…我来是因为我已经没有什么可失去的了
...I came because I have nothing left to lose.

478
00:37:38,584 --> 00:37:43,886
事实上，我很惭愧 癌症扩散了之后，我才有这个勇气
The truth is, I'm ashamed that it took metastasizing to give me the courage.

479
00:37:44,056 --> 00:37:48,618
我让那个混蛋威胁了我这么长时间
I let that bastard frighten me into submission for so long.

480
00:37:48,961 --> 00:37:55,389
由于太害怕，甚至一次都不敢跟你说 你对我来说是多么重要
I was too scared to even tell you just once how much you mean to me.

481
00:37:57,769 --> 00:38:01,034
我是多么希望，你成长的时候，有我在身边
How much I wanted to help you grow up.

482
00:38:01,273 --> 00:38:06,233
我也希望你能够 那样我会成长为一个更好的人
I wish you had. I might be a better man.

483
00:38:07,145 --> 00:38:12,378
事实上，你能来，就已经表示出你的为人
The fact that you're here speaks volumes about the man that you are.

484
00:38:16,455 --> 00:38:18,980
你母亲肯定会很自豪
Your mother would be proud.

485
00:38:23,895 --> 00:38:28,355
- 我很想念她 - 我也是
-I really miss her. -So do I.

486
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:49,555
（周末短诗，购物赠搭讪名言）

487
00:38:54,459 --> 00:38:57,121
- 我刚和贾斯丁的父母谈过 - 他怎么样？
-I just spoke to Justin's parents. -How's he doing?

488
00:38:57,296 --> 00:39:00,663
他在精神病房，警方还不知道以什么罪名起诉他…
He's in the psychiatric ward. The police don't know what to charge him with...

489
00:39:00,832 --> 00:39:02,925
…但至少他不可能再伤害到别人了
...but at least he won't hurt anybody.

490
00:39:04,436 --> 00:39:10,671
那现在是你批评我“早就告诉过你了”之类的 还是我自己给自己检讨就算了
So should we do the "I told you so" part or is my perennial bad judgment implicit?

491
00:39:10,876 --> 00:39:12,935
克罗伊，我也希望我是错的
Chloe, I wish I were wrong.

492
00:39:13,412 --> 00:39:17,678
我到底是怎么了？ 我能够看穿老远之外的很奇怪的事情…
What is it with me? I can spot Wall of Weird material from a mile away...

493
00:39:17,849 --> 00:39:20,010
…但当事情发生在我跟前时，我却糊涂了
...but put it in front of me and I'm oblivious.

494
00:39:20,285 --> 00:39:23,049
你不是糊涂，你这是信任
You're not oblivious, you're trusting.

495
00:39:23,555 --> 00:39:26,388
你心里足够强大，愿意为感情冒险
You're strong enough to take risks with your emotions.

496
00:39:26,558 --> 00:39:28,958
我真希望能够像你一样勇敢
I wish I were as brave as you.

497
00:39:30,829 --> 00:39:33,491
那两张去记者大会的票我还拿着
I still have those tickets to the journalism convention.

498
00:39:35,334 --> 00:39:38,462
这对我们来说是个很不错的共处的机会
It'd be a good chance for us to spend some time together.

499
00:39:39,971 --> 00:39:42,030
好的，就算约会了
Okay, it's a date.

500
00:40:07,532 --> 00:40:10,330
惠特尼，我们需要谈谈
Whitney, we need to talk.

501
00:40:12,671 --> 00:40:15,196
怎么了？出什么事了？
What is it? What happened?

502
00:40:16,308 --> 00:40:18,173
我父亲去世了
It's my dad.
