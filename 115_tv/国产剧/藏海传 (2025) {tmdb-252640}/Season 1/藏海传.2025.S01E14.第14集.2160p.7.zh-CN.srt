I wasn't looking forward to a night out on my own.

67
00:05:03,617 --> 00:05:05,949
- …更能败掉我的食欲了 - 是因为传记那部分…

68
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,918
…还是因为我们被胡乱分配了啊
...or the fact that our student subjects were randomly assigned?

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
埃里克・布瑞克

正是杰出的肯特先生

联合制片:格雷格・沃克

…肯定能发掘出你的料的

Come on, Clark, cough up. Who'd you get?

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,300
导演:迈克尔・卡特曼
Like I said, definitely rigged.

100
00:06:02,609 --> 00:06:04,668
正如我所说，肯定有暗中操纵

101
00:06:04,845 --> 00:06:07,643
- 我猜你会赶快动笔了？ - 我能搞好这作业的
-I assume you'll start your paper ASAP? -It's all gonna work out.

102
00:06:07,815 --> 00:06:10,579
我在帮拉娜准备塔龙开张
I'm helping Lana at the Talon getting ready for the opening.

103
00:06:10,751 --> 00:06:14,346

好吧，随时
Right. I'll be around.

107
00:06:21,929 --> 00:06:24,022
他在敷衍我吗？
Did he just blow me off?

108
00:06:24,198 --> 00:06:27,895
你进一步，他退两步，别理他了
One step forward, two steps back. Come on.

109
00:06:32,673 --> 00:06:34,698
你答应过一切会按时准备好

110
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,275
可那时水管还没裂

-Hasn't been replaced in years. -How long will that take?

112
00:06:41,014 --> 00:06:46,782
不上去检查，没法给你准确答案
I can't really give you a straight answer, not until I crawl up there.

113
00:06:47,321 --> 00:06:50,586
翻新老店，老毛病当然不可避免
You resurrect the past, you get the problems that come with it.

不过，我姨妈要到下周才能给你面试
And just to warn you, my aunt's not taking any more interviews until next week.

121
00:07:22,122 --> 00:07:25,421
没关系，我有的是时间
Well, that's all right. I happen to have all the time in the world.

122
00:07:25,592 --> 00:07:28,755

00:07:29,396 --> 00:07:32,957
我听说莱克斯・卢瑟在这个项目中有股份
So I understand that Lex Luthor has a stake in this project.

124
00:07:34,034 --> 00:07:36,298
他是业主之一，怎么？你认识他？
Yeah, he's one of the owners. Why? Do you know him?

00:07:37,604 --> 00:07:41,165
- 很久以前在大都市的时候 - 一定很有趣
-A lifetime ago in Metropolis. -Must have been interesting.

126
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:45,144
其实他来斯摩维尔是有原因的
Well, let's just say there's a reason he's in Smallville.

127
00:07:46,513 --> 00:07:49,846
想听我的建议吗？离他远点
You know my advice? Stay away from him.

128
00:07:50,284 --> 00:07:53,776
只要莱克斯插手，事情就会变糟
When Lex gets involved, things usually turn out badly.

129
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,966
你来这干什么？我们之前说好的
What are you doing here? We had an understanding.

130
00:08:15,142 --> 00:08:17,406
那晚之后，我们再也不联系
After that night, we were never to have any contact.

131

裘德
Jude.

133
00:08:22,482 --> 00:08:25,542
- 我们都知道那是不可能的 - 听我说！他还活着
-We both know that's impossible. -Listen to me! He's alive.

134
00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:27,380
我到哪都能看到他
Everywhere I go, I see him.

135
00:08:27,554 --> 00:08:30,114
- 他在跟踪我 - 冷静点，凯瑟
-He's stalking me. -Kasich. Calm down.

136
00:08:30,924 --> 00:08:32,323
我没疯
I'm not crazy.

137
00:08:33,193 --> 00:08:37,527
- 这个人说他要什么了吗？ - 说了，要真相
-This man say what he wanted? -Yeah. The truth.

138
00:08:41,101 --> 00:08:43,228
听着，我在城里有一间公寓
Listen. I keep an apartment in the city.

139
00:08:43,403 --> 00:08:47,931
那很安全，你呆在那，等我电话
It's very secure. You stay there and wait for my call.

140
00:08:56,617 --> 00:08:58,608
- 嘿，莱克斯 - 你好
-Hey, Lex. -Hey.

141
00:08:58,785 --> 00:09:01,447
- 那是谁? - 闲人吧
-Who was that? -Nobody.

142
00:09:05,058 --> 00:09:06,423
听说咱这边漏水了
I hear we sprung a leak.

143
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:10,826
事情都还顺利吗?
Is everything all right?

144
00:09:11,898 --> 00:09:14,594
- 有点不顺 - 别紧张，漏水而已
-Just a little weirded out. -Relax, it's just a leak.

145
00:09:14,835 --> 00:09:18,066
不是，你一个朋友过来，申请助理的工作
No, a friend of yours came by, applied for the assistant manager position.

146
00:09:18,505 --> 00:09:21,838
他让我离你远点
He told me to stay away from you.

147
00:09:24,311 --> 00:09:26,541
他叫什么
What was his name?

148
00:09:30,617 --> 00:09:31,879
裘德・罗伊斯
Jude Royce.

149
00:09:41,395 --> 00:09:44,421
- 怎么了，莱克斯？ - 他什么时候离开的?
-What is it, Lex? -When did he leave?

150
00:09:44,598 --> 00:09:46,031
就在你进来之前
Just before you came in.

151
00:09:58,945 --> 00:10:02,540
莱克斯，裘德・罗伊斯是谁？
Lex, who's Jude Royce?

152
00:10:02,783 --> 00:10:05,684
相信我，克拉克 虽然我不知道拉娜今天见到的是谁
Trust me, Clark, I have no idea who Lana met today...

153
00:10:05,852 --> 00:10:08,082
但不可能是他
...but it couldn't have been him.

154
00:10:10,624 --> 00:10:13,286
别担心这个，克拉克，我不担心
Don't worry about it, Clark. I'm not.

155
00:10:28,075 --> 00:10:29,940
怎么了？
What's going on?

156
00:10:30,677 --> 00:10:31,803
我不知道
I don't know!

157
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,111
摸摸仪表盘下面
Feel under the dash.

158
00:10:54,134 --> 00:10:57,103
看来有人趁我们进去时搞了点创意啊
Looks like someone decided to get creative while I was inside.

159
00:10:57,704 --> 00:10:59,035
那尖叫声是怎么回事？
What were the screams?

160
00:10:59,573 --> 00:11:02,872
我猜是有人变态的恶作剧
I assume it's someone's twisted idea of a joke.

161
00:11:03,043 --> 00:11:05,807
很成功啊，招来了一堆人
And a successful one. We've managed to draw a crowd.

162
00:11:11,685 --> 00:11:16,054
- 莱克斯 - 克拉克，你真不用担心这事
-Lex. -Clark, this really doesn't concern you.

163
00:11:28,034 --> 00:11:29,865
有人在家吗？
Hello, anybody home?

164
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,471
嘿，我们在做录音访问，儿子
Hey, pull up a microphone, son.

165
00:11:35,008 --> 00:11:37,499
- 克罗伊，怎么了？ - 因为我找不到你…
-Chloe, what's going on? -Since I couldn't find you...

166
00:11:37,677 --> 00:11:40,510
…就决定从故事源头开始我的传记调查
...I decided to start my biographical inquiry at the beginning.

167
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,648
不像我某个所谓的朋友…
Unlike a certain so-called friend of mine...

168
00:11:42,816 --> 00:11:45,011
…你父母很通情达理地接受了我的采访
...your parents gracefully agreed to be interviewed.

169
00:11:45,185 --> 00:11:48,245
克洛伊问了我们一些有趣的问题，克拉克
Chloe's been asking us some very interesting questions, Clark.

170
00:11:48,722 --> 00:11:51,555
谢谢，还有几个问题要探讨，所以…
Thank you. Now, we just have a few more to go, so....

171
00:11:52,292 --> 00:11:54,226
聊聊以前的事吧
We were talking about the early days.

172
00:11:54,427 --> 00:11:56,657
你们是怎么领养克拉克的？
Now, what was involved in adopting Clark?

173
00:11:57,998 --> 00:12:01,798
只是次很普通的领养
Well, it was-- It was just like any normal adoption, I guess.

174
00:12:01,968 --> 00:12:05,267
你能告诉我这个过程吗？ 这个过程花费了几个礼拜还是几个月？
Can you take me through the process? Did it takes weeks or months?

175
00:12:05,438 --> 00:12:08,532
你们用了律师，还是通过代理人…?
Did you guys use a lawyer, or did you go through an agen--?

176
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:13,611
该死，录音带用完了 没关系，我车上还有几盘
Shoot. I'm out of tape. That's okay, I've got some extra C-90s in my car.

177
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,543
我很快回来
I'll be right back.

178
00:12:18,752 --> 00:12:21,016
克洛伊为了学校作业，在调查你的生活吗？
Chloe's researching your life for a school project?

179
00:12:21,188 --> 00:12:23,656
- 什么时候的事？ - 我们今天分的作业
-When did that happen? -We just got the assignment today.

180
00:12:23,824 --> 00:12:25,553
没想到她真会像迈克・华莱士一样较真
I didn't know she was gonna go Mike Wallace.

181
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:27,386
儿子，我们不介意谈论你…
We don't mind talking about you...

182
00:12:27,561 --> 00:12:30,121
…可她要是再问关于领养的事…
...but if she starts asking questions about the adoption....

183
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:32,794
领养怎么了？
What about the adoption?

184
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,558
有什么我应该知道的事？
Is there something I should know?

185
00:12:37,404 --> 00:12:39,497
当然，我们需要编个故事…
Well, of course, we had to make up a story...

186
00:12:39,673 --> 00:12:41,538
…但这更复杂
...but it's more complicated than that.

187
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:44,700
就说我们不想任何人调查这方面好了
Let's just say it's a subject we would rather not have anyone explore.

188
00:12:44,878 --> 00:12:46,277
不好意思，打扰到你们了吗？
Sorry. Am I interrupting?

189
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,505
克拉克，既然你终于走进我的调查圈子…
Clark, now that you're finally spinning in my orbit...

190
00:12:49,683 --> 00:12:52,049
…我也有些事想问你
...I have a couple of pertinents for you too.

191
00:12:52,219 --> 00:12:54,244
实际上，我只是过来看一下
Actually, this is just a pit stop for me.

192
00:12:54,421 --> 00:12:56,651
我正要去找拉娜准备我的论文
I'm on my way to meet Lana to work on my paper.

193
00:12:57,324 --> 00:13:02,261
克拉克，不是我有意瞎猜，但你是在回避我吗？
You know, Clark, not to strike a paranoid note, but are you avoiding me?

194
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,062
明天，我保证
Tomorrow, I promise.

195
00:13:13,073 --> 00:13:15,439
好的，这不是一个正式问题…
Okay, this isn't an official question...

196
00:13:15,609 --> 00:13:18,237
…我也不想你们误会我这问题…
...and I don't want you guys to take it the wrong way...

197
00:13:18,411 --> 00:13:21,312
…不过，你们的儿子一直这么奇怪吗？
...but has your son always been this strange?

198
00:13:24,885 --> 00:13:27,080
- 感觉怎么样？ - 什么感觉？
-How does it feel? -Feel?

199
00:13:27,254 --> 00:13:30,951
单枪匹马就把差点变成停车场的塔龙救回来？
To single-handedly bring the Talon back from the brink of becoming a parking garage?

200
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:36,125
这种被依靠，肩负责任的感觉很好
It's nice, you know, being counted on, having responsibility.

201
00:13:36,296 --> 00:13:39,163
- 人们对我也会不一样了 - 这下不会觉得你是脆弱的人了
-People treat you differently. -Like you won't break.

202
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:43,328
终于感觉自己慢慢脱下了公主的外衣
Finally feel like I'm shedding that fairy-princess costume.

203
00:13:55,382 --> 00:13:58,283
- 莱克斯，你来干嘛? - 承包商打电话给我
-Lex, what are you doing here? -Contractor called.

204
00:13:58,451 --> 00:14:01,284
说他有了估价，希望我来这找他
Said he had an estimate, wanted me to meet him here.

205
00:14:11,197 --> 00:14:13,062
怎么了？
What the hell?

206
00:14:13,466 --> 00:14:15,457
你还好吗？
Are you okay?

207
00:14:16,536 --> 00:14:21,439
我从后门进来时，有人扑过来…
Yeah. I came in the back door and some guy jumped me...

208
00:14:21,641 --> 00:14:24,337
…逼我给他开门，还打了我的头
...and forced me to let him in and bashed me over the head.

209
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,502
你看见他的脸没?
Did you see his face?

210
00:14:27,213 --> 00:14:28,840
没有
No.

211
00:14:30,917 --> 00:14:32,043
看
Look.

212
00:14:35,555 --> 00:14:39,548
我锁门的时候它不在那，我去叫警察
That wasn't there when I locked up. I'll go call the police.

213
00:14:43,863 --> 00:14:46,058
莱克斯，上面有你的名字
Lex, your name's on it.

214
00:15:03,883 --> 00:15:06,249
写的是“零后果”
Zero consequences.

215
00:15:27,173 --> 00:15:29,368
你怎么样了？
How you holding up?

216
00:15:29,876 --> 00:15:33,073
本来还好…可一看到那手
I was fine...until it showed up.

217
00:15:33,246 --> 00:15:35,578
是的，问得真愚蠢
Yeah, stupid question.

218
00:15:35,749 --> 00:15:38,616
怎么会有这么变态的人做这种事？
What kind of a sick person would do a thing like that?

219
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:41,186
我不知道
I don't know.

220
00:15:41,521 --> 00:15:43,989
从没见过莱克斯这么不安
But I've never seen Lex so freaked out before.

221
00:15:44,157 --> 00:15:46,091
我也没
Join the club.

222
00:15:46,826 --> 00:15:51,354
那人警告我，凡是莱克斯插手的事都没好下场
That guy warned me. He said everything Lex touches ends badly.

223
00:15:52,065 --> 00:15:54,192
关于他和他的过去，我们到底知道多少?
How much do we really know about him and his past?

224
00:15:55,935 --> 00:15:59,234
我希望你们知道我对此多么抱歉
I want you both to know how truly sorry I am about this.

225
00:15:59,406 --> 00:16:01,306
我保证不会影响开张
I promise this won't affect the grand opening.

226
00:16:02,142 --> 00:16:05,339
可我们会在开张前就已经声名狼藉了
We're going to be infamous before we even open the doors.

227
00:16:16,523 --> 00:16:19,515
你知道他是谁吗？盒子里那手的…
Do you know who he is? The guy in the.... You know.

228
00:16:19,692 --> 00:16:24,652
马克斯・凯瑟，多年前我们在大都会相识
Max Kasich. And yes, I knew him a long time ago in Metropolis.

229
00:16:25,932 --> 00:16:28,196
你知道谁可能对他做那种事吗？
Do you have any idea who might have done this to him?

230
00:16:28,368 --> 00:16:29,665
不知道
Not at all.

231
00:16:32,105 --> 00:16:34,767
会是你的老朋友裘德・罗伊斯吗？
What about your old friend Jude Royce?

232
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:38,936
- 我相信不是他，克拉克 - 为什么？
-I doubt it could have been him, Clark. -Why?

233
00:16:39,512 --> 00:16:42,072
因为他已经死了三年了
Because he's been dead for three years.

234
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:51,380
我从肯特家得到的唯一…
The only information I got from the Kents...

235
00:16:51,558 --> 00:16:54,220
…惊天动地的消息就是克拉克不喜欢豌豆
...was the earth-shattering admission that Clark hates peas.

236
00:16:54,394 --> 00:16:57,363
塔龙出现了断肢，但你所谈论的只有克拉克？
A body part shows up at the Talon and all you can talk about is Clark?

237
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,556
你分不出轻重吗？莱克斯・卢瑟肯定与其有关
Where are your priorities? Lex Luthor must be mixed up in this.

238
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:04,100
- 别这样，我知道你对卢瑟有意见 - 岂止是意见
-I know you've got issues with the Luthors-- -More than issues.

239
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,931
你知道卢瑟家族是怎么对我家人的
You know what they did to my family.

240
00:17:06,106 --> 00:17:07,903
这些信息也要一条一条来谈
One piece of investigative information at a time.

241
00:17:08,074 --> 00:17:10,634
- 现在，关于克拉克… - 克洛伊，你想从我这里知道什么？
-Now, about Clark.... -Chloe, what do you want from me?

242
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:13,278
如果把别人都比作高级矿泉水 克拉克也是像自来水一样普通
In a world of designer water, Clark's from the tap.

243
00:17:13,446 --> 00:17:17,143
我知道，但你认识他最长时间 我所要的不过是一点趣闻轶事罢了…
I know, but you've known him the longest. All I need is just a little anecdote...

244
00:17:17,317 --> 00:17:20,343
…只要一点关于他灰暗过去的消息
...just a small piece of information from Clark's deep, dark past.

245
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,954
一年级时发生了件事
Well, there was something back in the first grade.

246
00:17:23,123 --> 00:17:25,990
谢谢！这可比我这两天得到的信息还要多
Thank you! That's more than I've uncovered the past two days.

247
00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:27,626
现在，拜托，快给我讲吧
Now, please, let's continue.

248
00:17:27,794 --> 00:17:29,455
当时有个大我们三级的小霸王
There was a bully three grades ahead.

249
00:17:29,629 --> 00:17:32,097
这家伙要把学校里每个人都揍一顿
This dude was determined to pound dents into every kid.

250
00:17:32,265 --> 00:17:35,200
那天轮到我倒霉，他正要揍我…
One day it was my turn. He was just about to take my head off...

251
00:17:35,368 --> 00:17:38,633
- …克拉克就跳到我们中间 - 克拉克竟然干涉打架
-...when Clark jumped between us. -So Clark ran interference?

252
00:17:40,206 --> 00:17:42,140
不过，这听起来没什么特别，皮特…
Now, as kind as that sounds, Pete...

253
00:17:42,308 --> 00:17:44,742
…我不认为它符合“惊人猛料”的标准
...I don't think it falls into the "something amazing" test.

254
00:17:44,911 --> 00:17:46,173
- 什么标准？ - 我还没说完
-What test? -I'm not finished.

255
00:17:46,346 --> 00:17:48,871
克拉克不只是推了他，连门都撞破了
Clark didn't just push Braindead, he put him through a door...

256
00:17:49,048 --> 00:17:52,415
…当时遍地碎片，合叶都断了 我至今不知道他是怎么做到的
...as in splinters and broken hinges. How he did it, I still have no idea.

257
00:17:52,585 --> 00:17:55,577
- 那家伙个头至少是我们两倍 - 克拉克 ，怎么解释？
-Guy was at least twice our size. -Clark, any comments?

258
00:17:58,024 --> 00:18:01,824
我们那时才六岁，两倍也只不过三英尺高
Well, we were, you know, 6 years old. Twice our size was three feet tall.

259
00:18:02,362 --> 00:18:04,489
如果想听更多以前的轶事 还是问本人吧
If you need more ancient history, ask the source.

260
00:18:04,664 --> 00:18:07,189
我在学生商店还约了人
I've got an appointment at the student store.

261
00:18:07,367 --> 00:18:09,130
祝你调查愉快
Have fun.

262
00:18:09,469 --> 00:18:12,905
如此，克拉克・肯特的秘密更神秘了
And so the mystery that isn't Clark Kent deepens.

263
00:18:13,072 --> 00:18:14,300
- 秘密？ - 对
-Mystery? -Yeah.

264
00:18:14,474 --> 00:18:16,442
因为你总是扮演着妨碍者的角色…
Since you continue to play obstructionist...

265
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:18,975
…我已经从其他途径找到了消息
...l've had to find information through other means.

266
00:18:19,145 --> 00:18:22,637
我发现你的领养手续 是在大都会的联合慈善机构完成的
I found that your adoption was done through Metropolis United Charities...

267
00:18:22,815 --> 00:18:25,909
…奇怪的地方就在这，他们那时才成立了六个月…
...but this is the strange part. They were in business for six months...

268
00:18:26,085 --> 00:18:28,918
…而且，你是他们唯一的领养案例
...and from what I can tell, yours is the only adoption they handled.

269
00:18:29,088 --> 00:18:30,715
不敢相信你调查这些，克洛伊
I can't believe you did this, Chloe.

270
00:18:32,358 --> 00:18:35,885
你不知道吗？我以为你父母告诉你了
You didn't know? I just assumed that your parents would have told you.

271
00:18:36,062 --> 00:18:38,758
- 我是说，你不感兴趣吗？ - 我为什么要感兴趣？
-I mean, weren't you interested? -Why would I be?

272
00:18:38,932 --> 00:18:41,332
我亲生父母要么过世了要么抛弃了我
My biological parents are either dead or didn't want me.

273
00:18:41,501 --> 00:18:44,868
- 而你正在窥探我的私人生活 - 我只是想彻底搞明白而已
-You're prying into my private life. -I was just trying to be thorough.

274
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:48,633
不过是一个班级作业 我昨天只花了一小时和拉娜在一起，就这样
This is a class project. I spent an hour yesterday with Lana, that's it.

275
00:18:48,808 --> 00:18:53,006
我需要点小资料就成了 你非把我当成要调查的秘密吗
That's all I needed. I'm not some mystery for you to solve.

276
00:18:54,347 --> 00:18:56,042
克拉克，我…
Clark, I....

277
00:19:01,788 --> 00:19:03,483
说吧，瑞恩斯先生
Talk to me, Mr. Raines.

278
00:19:03,656 --> 00:19:08,184
据门卫说，凯瑟没能赶到你在大都会的公寓
According to the doorman, Kasich never made it to the apartment in Metropolis.

279
00:19:08,361 --> 00:19:11,524
- 罗伊斯呢？ - 他父母在他小时候就过世了
-What about Royce? -His parents died when he was young.

280
00:19:11,698 --> 00:19:15,134
因为车祸，他是独子，继承了所有东西
Car accident. He was an only child, inherited everything.

281
00:19:15,301 --> 00:19:17,667
阿曼达・罗斯曼呢？你跟踪到她了吗？
And Amanda Rothman? Have you tracked her down yet?

282
00:19:17,837 --> 00:19:22,240
她搬走了，没留下地址 你最后一次和她通话是什么时候？
She moved, left no forwarding address. When's the last time you spoke to her?

283
00:19:22,408 --> 00:19:25,707
- 大约三年前 - 我会更深入调查，但需要些时间
-About three years ago. -I'll go wider, but it could take some time.

284
00:19:25,878 --> 00:19:27,743
如果能告诉我发生了什么，或许会有帮助
It'd help if you tell me what's going on.

285
00:19:28,281 --> 00:19:30,306
不，我不能跟你说，你只是安保负责人
No, it wouldn't. You're my head of security.

286
00:19:30,483 --> 00:19:32,644
你找到并警告她可能会有危险
You find her and warn her she could be in danger.

287
00:19:32,819 --> 00:19:34,787
这就是全部你需要知道的
That's all you need to know.

288
00:19:53,373 --> 00:19:57,571
让一下，警察 借过，警察
Make a path. Police. Excuse me, excuse me. Police.

289
00:19:58,111 --> 00:20:01,808
- 你是谁？ - 大都会警察局，警探萨姆・费伦
-Who are you? -Detective Sam Phelan, Metropolis P.D.

290
00:20:01,981 --> 00:20:04,074
你是这破动物园的保安吗？
Are you what passes for security in this zoo?

291
00:20:04,384 --> 00:20:08,252
- 对 - 呆在这，我们得谈谈
-Yeah. -Don't go anywhere. We'll talk.

292
00:20:09,555 --> 00:20:11,887
- 感谢上帝，你来了 - 莱克斯啊，莱克斯啊
-Thank God you're here. -Lex, Lex.

293
00:20:12,058 --> 00:20:14,618
你这回真把事搞大了
You really put your foot in it this time.

294
00:20:14,794 --> 00:20:16,853
告诉我到底发生了什么？
Tell me exactly what happened.

295
00:20:17,864 --> 00:20:20,890
如果你不信任我，我可帮不了你
Hey, if you fall apart on me, I can't help you.

296
00:20:21,067 --> 00:20:23,001
到底发生什么了？
Now what went down?

297
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,311
这是事实？
That's exactly what happened?

298
00:20:40,253 --> 00:20:43,552
好，接下来这样
Good. Here's how it's gonna go.

299
00:20:43,723 --> 00:20:47,784
你从没来过这里，你的名字… …不会出现在任何报纸或者警察笔录里
You were never here. Your name will not appear in any papers or the police report.

300
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,794
- 怎么会？ - 这就是你老爸钱的作用
-How? -That's what your daddy's money's for.

301
00:20:52,398 --> 00:20:54,798
这次他要花大价钱了
This one's gonna cost him.

302
00:20:55,168 --> 00:20:59,127
- 阿曼达怎么办？ - 我会安排好每个人的口供
-What about Amanda? -I'll take care of everybody's story...

303
00:20:59,305 --> 00:21:03,071
…但你永远不能再见她 或者再跟她联系，明白吗？
...but you are never to see her or talk to her again. You got it?

304
00:21:03,376 --> 00:21:06,539
给这家伙打电话，他会帮你处理肩伤
Call this guy, he'll take care of your shoulder.

305
00:21:06,946 --> 00:21:09,278
不要去医院
No emergency rooms.

306
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,509
好，出去吧
All right, get out of here.

307
00:21:25,264 --> 00:21:27,994
- 你看到事情经过了？ - 大部分
-Did you see what happened? -Most of it.

308
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:32,729
高兴点，你因此会得到一大笔钱
Well, smile. Because you're about to come into some serious money.

309
00:21:56,829 --> 00:21:58,160
就没什么要说的吗？
Nothing to say?

310
00:22:02,702 --> 00:22:07,503
- 我以为莱克斯・卢瑟无所不知呢 - 听着，你个变态，杂种
-I thought Lex Luthor had all the answers. -Look, you twisted son of a bitch.

311
00:22:07,673 --> 00:22:10,870
- 我不知道你想要什么 - 我想知道在零点俱乐部发生了什么
-I don't know what you want. -I wanna know what happened at Club Zero.

312
00:22:11,043 --> 00:22:13,011
被掩盖的事实
The cover-up.

313
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,814
你知道那个警察吗？
You know the cop?

314
00:22:16,983 --> 00:22:18,951
笔录提到的那个人，费伦？
The one on the report? Phelan?

315
00:22:20,153 --> 00:22:22,246
他死了
He's dead.

316
00:22:22,755 --> 00:22:26,691
似乎你也多少有牵连，太有趣了
It seems that you were somehow involved in that too. I find that very interesting.

317
00:22:28,027 --> 00:22:30,222
你为什么不现在就杀了我？
Why don't you kill me now?

318
00:22:32,031 --> 00:22:34,693
因为看你受折磨更有趣
Because it's more fun to watch you suffer.

319
00:22:35,435 --> 00:22:37,369
看你害怕自己任何时刻都可能会被，砰！
Knowing that at any moment, bang!

320
00:22:41,441 --> 00:22:43,102
告诉我！
Tell me.

321
00:22:44,744 --> 00:22:48,043
到底发生了什么？
What really happened?

322
00:22:49,015 --> 00:22:50,846
莱克斯！
Lex!

323
00:22:56,556 --> 00:22:59,184
莱克斯，你还好吧？
Lex, you all right?

324
00:23:02,929 --> 00:23:04,954
克拉克，你来这干嘛？
Clark, what are you doing here?

325
00:23:05,431 --> 00:23:07,695
你办公室的人告诉我你在这
Your office told me you were here.

326
00:23:09,268 --> 00:23:11,236
我好像听到有其他人在这
I thought I heard someone else.

327
00:23:11,404 --> 00:23:14,134
不，就我一个人
No. I'm all by myself.

328
00:23:15,475 --> 00:23:17,966
嘿，我调查了马克斯・凯瑟
Hey, I looked up Max Kasich.

329
00:23:18,244 --> 00:23:20,212
我知道零点俱乐部发生了什么
I know what happened at Club Zero.

330
00:23:20,379 --> 00:23:25,146
他开枪杀了裘德・罗伊斯 除了你，所有人都被牵扯进来了
That he was shot and killed Jude Royce. Everyone fits into this except for you.

331
00:23:25,885 --> 00:23:28,251
- 怎么了？ - 拜托了，克拉克
-What's going on? -Please, Clark.

332
00:23:28,421 --> 00:23:30,981
为了我们的友谊，拜托你别插手这事
For our friendship, I'm asking you to stay out of this.

333
00:23:31,924 --> 00:23:34,722
一些秘密最好还是不管为妙
Some secrets are better left alone.

334
00:23:41,534 --> 00:23:43,263
克拉克
Clark.

335
00:23:45,538 --> 00:23:49,907
拜托，儿子，牛可不会自己喂自己
Come on, son, the cows aren't gonna feed themselves.

336
00:23:50,176 --> 00:23:52,337
- 你昨晚很晚才睡？ - 我在帮拉娜
-You have a late night? -I was helping Lana.

337
00:23:52,512 --> 00:23:56,710
她不想让断肢事件影响塔龙开业
She's not gonna let the whole body-part incident delay the opening of the Talon.

338
00:23:56,883 --> 00:24:00,512
这就是跟莱克斯・卢瑟这种人打交道的结果
That's what happens when you get into business with somebody like Lex Luthor.

339
00:24:00,686 --> 00:24:03,280
如果不是莱克斯，塔龙就变成停车场了
If it wasn't for Lex, the Talon would be a parking garage.

340
00:24:03,456 --> 00:24:05,447
孩子，真不知他对你的影响会多远
Son, he casts a very, very long shadow.

341
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:08,594
我只是想保证你们这些孩子不会受伤
I just want to make sure none of you kids get hurt, that's all.

342
00:24:08,761 --> 00:24:12,822
过去的已经过去了，我们最好向前看
The past is in the past. The best we can do is look to the future.

343
00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:14,830
好吧，你说倒我了
All right, you got me.

344
00:24:15,001 --> 00:24:18,129
说到这，克罗伊的论文怎么样了？
Speaking of that, how's Chloe's paper coming along?

345
00:24:18,304 --> 00:24:21,740
- 我想她的采访应该结束了吧 - 不确定
-I assume she's done with her interviews? -I'm not sure.

346
00:24:21,908 --> 00:24:25,241
听我说，克拉克 如果她跟你提及豌豆的事情，我很抱歉
Look, Clark, if she mentions anything to you about the peas, I'm sorry.

347
00:24:25,411 --> 00:24:27,402
这是我当时能想到的第一件事
It's the first thing that came to mind.

348
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:32,017
如果她跟我提及了大都会慈善联合会呢？
And if she mentions anything to me about the Metropolis United Charities?

349
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,621
我本以为坚持不懈是一种可贵的品质 可她这样真是…
I used to think perseverance was an admirable quality.

350
00:24:38,157 --> 00:24:41,558
自从知道真相，我还没想过领养的事
Since I learned the real truth, I hadn't thought about the adoption.

351
00:24:41,761 --> 00:24:45,561
爸爸，克罗伊告诉我 你们领养我的机构只成立了六个月
Dad, Chloe told me the agency you used was only open six months...

352
00:24:45,731 --> 00:24:48,165
…而我是唯一一个被领养的孩子
...and I was the only kid adopted.

353
00:24:48,434 --> 00:24:50,402
听我说，孩子…
Look, son...

354
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:54,804
…即使通过正常渠道领养个孩子 过程都很艰辛的
...the process is a really tough one even when you go through normal channels.

355
00:24:54,974 --> 00:24:57,841
领养你，只是更复杂点罢了，就是这样
With you, it was just a little more complicated, that's all.

356
00:24:58,511 --> 00:25:02,447
- 都合法吗？ - 都合法，只是…
-Is everything legal? -Yeah, it's legal, it's just....

357
00:25:02,715 --> 00:25:06,014
当时要办妥这件事 不是我跟你妈能力所及的
Well, it required a higher level of access than your mother or I had.

358
00:25:06,185 --> 00:25:08,119
什么意思？
What does that mean?

359
00:25:10,456 --> 00:25:14,119
我只想跟你说 在地窖里的那个东西和你的出生证明之间…
Let's just say it's a long road between what's sitting in our storm cellar...

360
00:25:14,327 --> 00:25:16,727
…有太复杂的故事
...and what's written on your birth certificate.

361
00:25:19,832 --> 00:25:23,233
- 你听到了吗？ - 听到什么？
-You hear that? -Hear what?

362
00:25:24,403 --> 00:25:27,861
牛群在那边高地，应该能听到动静才对
The whole herd's just over that rise. We ought to be hearing something.

363
00:26:10,683 --> 00:26:12,378
你觉得发生了什么事？
What do you think happened?

364
00:26:12,551 --> 00:26:15,520
为什么卢瑟集团会把废物倒弃这儿？
Why would LuthorCorp dump their stuff here?

365
00:26:24,163 --> 00:26:27,155
我去从别的角度拍些照片
I'm gonna go take from some different angles.

366
00:26:45,351 --> 00:26:49,788
肯特夫妇，我不清楚怎么会这样…
Mr. and Mrs. Kent, I have no idea how this could have happened...

367
00:26:49,955 --> 00:26:54,619
…但我会尽全力找到原因
...but I'll do everything in my power to find out.

368
00:26:55,594 --> 00:26:58,620
我当然也会补偿你的家畜损失
And I'll pay for your livestock, of course.

369
00:26:58,898 --> 00:27:02,061
这就是你解决所有问题的方式吗，莱克斯？
You think that's how you solve everything, don't you, Lex?

370
00:27:02,234 --> 00:27:06,000
撒点钱，就希望问题能消失
You sprinkle a little money on it and hope the problem goes away.

371
00:27:06,706 --> 00:27:10,403
事实上，有些事情可不是那么好办的
Well, obviously, some things are a little more difficult than that.

372
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:21,411
我还以为我在你父亲心里的形象 不会更差了呢
I didn't think it was possible to fall any further in your father's eyes.

373
00:27:21,587 --> 00:27:23,646
显然，我错了
Obviously, I was wrong.

374
00:27:25,591 --> 00:27:28,219
但我从没放任让这样的事情发生
I'd never intentionally allow something like this to happen.

375
00:27:28,627 --> 00:27:30,788
这跟零点俱乐部有关吗？
Does this have anything to do with Club Zero?

376
00:27:33,966 --> 00:27:36,196
- 我觉得是 - 你得告诉警方…
-I think so. -You need to tell the authorities...

377
00:27:36,368 --> 00:27:39,565
…所有你知道的事情 现在这不只是你个人的事了
...everything you know. This isn't just about you anymore.

378
00:27:46,746 --> 00:27:51,410
卢瑟先生，环保局的人找你谈话，在那边
Mr. Luthor, the C.E.P. guy needs to talk to you. He's over there.

379
00:28:04,296 --> 00:28:06,890
看来你们公司的环境记录要有污点了
Looks like a black mark on your company's environmental record.

380
00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:10,462
- 我要去找治安官 - 跟他说什么？
-I'm gonna walk over and get the sheriff. -And tell him what?

381
00:28:20,446 --> 00:28:22,880
告诉他克拉克・肯特来过电话，谢谢
Just tell him that Clark Kent called. Thank you.

382
00:28:23,048 --> 00:28:24,982
- 打给谁? - 我在找莱克斯
-Who was that? -I'm trying to reach Lex.

383
00:28:25,151 --> 00:28:27,244
他不在公司也不在家…
He's not in the office. He's not at the mansion...

384
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:29,944
…手机也直接转到语音信箱
...and his cell phone goes straight to voice mail.

385
00:28:30,456 --> 00:28:33,516
- 爸爸在哪？ - 还在监督搬运死牛
-Where's Dad? -Still supervising the removal of the cows.

386
00:28:33,692 --> 00:28:36,593
- 莱克斯说他会赔款的 - 克拉克，这不仅仅是钱的事
-Lex said he'd pay for that. -Clark, this isn't just about money.

387
00:28:36,762 --> 00:28:40,630
谁也不知道这会对我们和邻居的健康 造成什么样的威胁
We don't know what kind of health threat this poses to us or to our neighbors.

388
00:28:41,834 --> 00:28:43,426
我想这不是莱克斯的错
I don't think this is Lex's fault.

389
00:28:43,602 --> 00:28:47,265
我想有人在陷害他，因为夜店的事
I think someone is trying to set him up because of what happened at the nightclub.

390
00:28:47,439 --> 00:28:48,963
看
Look.

391
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,000
零点俱乐部死亡事件

392
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:54,704
- 事情还不明朗之前，我不想… - 莱克斯一直是个很好的朋友
-Until this is cleared up, I don't-- -Lex has always been a good friend.

393
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,848
我知道，我也一直维护他…
I know. I'm usually the one who defends him...

394
00:28:57,016 --> 00:29:00,144
…但他过去的名声确实不好
...but there are some things in his past that are a little shady.

395
00:29:00,686 --> 00:29:02,551
我以为咱们家不以过去评价人呢
In this family we don't look at the past.

396
00:29:02,721 --> 00:29:06,384
克拉克，我在大都会长大 我了解卢瑟家族
Clark, I grew up in Metropolis, I know the Luthor world.

397
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,585
看上去诱惑又有趣，但他们的孩子都太早熟…
It looks glamorous and fun, but the kids grow up too fast...

398
00:29:09,762 --> 00:29:11,286
…很容易陷入麻烦
...and they can get into trouble.

399
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:14,190
莱克斯的事情已经开始影响你了
Whatever's happening to Lex is starting to affect you.

400
00:29:14,366 --> 00:29:18,666
盒子里的断肢和中毒的奶牛？ 这些都不正常
Body parts in boxes and poisoned cows? This isn't normal.

401
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:21,336
你想让我怎么做？跟他断绝关系？
What do you want me to do? Cut him out of my life?

402
00:29:21,507 --> 00:29:25,136
不，我希望你暂时冷下这段友情 直到我们清楚到底发生了什么
No, I want you to cool it off for a while until we know what really happened.

403
00:29:25,811 --> 00:29:30,111
我和你爸爸不想你被他的问题牵连
Your father and I just don't want to see you pulled into his problems.

404
00:29:40,192 --> 00:29:42,422
我能跟你谈谈吗？
Can I talk to you for a second?

405
00:29:46,498 --> 00:29:47,988
你好吗？
How you doing?

406
00:29:48,167 --> 00:29:52,126
- 那要看你要不要录音了 - 好吧，我道歉
-That depends if it's on the record or not. -Okay, I deserve that.

407
00:29:52,304 --> 00:29:56,536
我并没想拿领养机构的事来套你的话
Look, I didn't mean to ambush you with the whole adoption agency thing.

408
00:29:56,876 --> 00:29:59,504
你看到有故事，就去调查
Hey, you saw a story and you went right for it.

409
00:29:59,678 --> 00:30:01,669
- 记者就这么做的 - 你是对的
-That's what journalists do. -You're right.

410
00:30:01,847 --> 00:30:03,838
我没想到这会伤害到你
I didn't think about how it would hurt you.

411
00:30:04,016 --> 00:30:08,077
你知道，虽然记者的本性有些反叛
And, you know, as much as journalistic instinct rebels...

412
00:30:08,254 --> 00:30:10,449
…但我不想因为一个课题失去朋友
...l'd rather have a friend than a subject...

413
00:30:10,623 --> 00:30:13,319
…所以我不再调查了
...so I'm dropping the whole thing.

414
00:30:15,728 --> 00:30:17,457
谢谢
Thank you.

415
00:30:18,664 --> 00:30:20,791
我能问个问题吗？
Can I ask you a question?

416
00:30:21,367 --> 00:30:23,494
绝对没有录音
Totally off the record.

417
00:30:25,638 --> 00:30:28,266
你想知道自己的亲生父母吗？
Do you ever wonder about your biological parents?

418
00:30:29,975 --> 00:30:32,068
生命里的每一天都在想
Every day of my life.

419
00:30:39,385 --> 00:30:42,149
看来我不是唯一做调查的人
Looks like I'm not the only one doing some digging.

420
00:30:42,321 --> 00:30:44,619
- 零点俱乐部怎么了？ - 跟莱克斯的过去有关
-What's Club Zero? -Part of Lex's past...

421
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:47,054
…他让我不要管
...he asked me to stay out of.

422
00:30:48,994 --> 00:30:52,430
我刚好给你父母带了些照片来
By the way, I brought by some pictures for your parents.

423
00:30:52,598 --> 00:30:55,658
申请保险赔偿的时候可能用的上
I figured they could use it for insurance purposes and stuff.

424
00:30:55,834 --> 00:30:58,098
我得走了
I'll see you later. I gotta go.

425
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,862
克罗伊…
Chloe...

426
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:03,906
…是同一个人
...it's the same guy.

427
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,339
- 可是他不是已经… - 死了
-Wait, but he's-- -Dead.

428
00:31:23,262 --> 00:31:24,991
救命!
Help!

429
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:27,993
有人吗？
Somebody!

430
00:31:28,634 --> 00:31:30,829
救命！
Help!

431
00:31:31,603 --> 00:31:33,730
救命！
Help!

432
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:40,134
有人吗？
Somebody!

433
00:31:40,879 --> 00:31:43,541
没有莱克斯的回话 早上到现在都没人联系得上他
No word from Lex. No one's spoken to him since this morning.

434
00:31:43,716 --> 00:31:47,516
我调出了这个所谓的死人的驾照 是用约翰・史密斯这个名字登记的，是原件
I pulled our alleged dead guy's license. It's registered to a John Smith. Original.

435
00:31:47,686 --> 00:31:50,450
他在大都会有个地址 但不是在环保局工作的
He has an address in Metropolis and does not work for the C.E.P.

436
00:31:50,622 --> 00:31:52,886
- 你怎么做到的？ - 我黑进了车辆管理局的数据库
-How'd you do that? -I hacked into the DMV database.

437
00:31:53,058 --> 00:31:55,618
- 有时候坚持不懈依然是个优点吧 - 打电话给大都会警察局
-Sometimes persistence is a good thing. -Call Metropolis P.D.

438
00:31:55,794 --> 00:31:58,126
- 让他们去那个地址 - 发生了什么？
-Have them go to that address. -What's going on?

439
00:31:58,297 --> 00:32:00,162
我想莱克斯有大麻烦了
I think Lex is in serious trouble.

440
00:32:08,807 --> 00:32:10,798
准备要说了吗？
You ready to talk?

441
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:15,877
你终于到了三年前就应该在的地方
You're finally where you should have been three years ago.

442
00:32:17,583 --> 00:32:19,778
暴露在聚光灯下
Exposed in the spotlight.

443
00:32:19,952 --> 00:32:22,512
你想要我怎么样？
What do you want from me?

444
00:32:23,155 --> 00:32:25,851
说出零点俱乐部里的真相
The truth about Club Zero.

445
00:32:26,851 --> 00:32:27,851
大都会警局车

446
00:32:53,585 --> 00:32:55,177
凯瑟
Kasich.

447
00:32:55,354 --> 00:32:58,255
打扰了，请问里面还有别人吗？
Excuse me, did you find anyone else in there?

448
00:33:02,828 --> 00:33:06,229
- 你知道零点俱乐部在哪吗？ - 孩子，你问晚了六个月了
-Do you know where I can find Club Zero? -You're six months too late, kid.

449
00:33:06,632 --> 00:33:08,463
- 什么意思？ - 已经关门了
-What do you mean? -Well, it closed down.

450
00:33:08,634 --> 00:33:10,693
就是第78道和主干道路口的一间旧仓库
It was an old warehouse on 78th and Main.

451
00:33:14,373 --> 00:33:18,104
骗子！那只是报道上说的，但不是真相
Liar! That's what it said in the papers, but that's not what really happened.

452
00:33:18,277 --> 00:33:21,610
- 事实就是这样，看警察笔录去吧！ - 我知道你掩盖得很全面
-It's the truth. Read the police reports! -I know you covered it up.

453
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,874
虽然我不知道你怎么做到的 但你要为此付出代价
I don't know how you did it, but you're gonna pay.

454
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,483
你是谁？
Who are you?

455
00:33:27,619 --> 00:33:29,610
不记得了吗？
Don't you remember?

456
00:33:32,157 --> 00:33:33,590
你杀了我
You killed me.

457
00:33:41,767 --> 00:33:44,292
这次你爸也救不了你，莱克斯
Daddy can't save you this time, Lex.

458
00:34:09,928 --> 00:34:11,691
游戏结束了，莱克斯
No more games, Lex.

459
00:34:12,998 --> 00:34:15,262
真相大白的时间到了
It's time for the truth.

460
00:34:27,813 --> 00:34:30,805
我认得你，你是塔龙的建筑承保人
I know you. You're the contractor from the Talon.

461
00:34:30,983 --> 00:34:33,213
那是我白天的工作
That's my day job.

462
00:34:36,855 --> 00:34:38,584
你是谁？
Who are you?

463
00:34:39,424 --> 00:34:41,289
阿曼达从没和你谈过她的家人吗？
Amanda never talked about her family?

464
00:34:42,628 --> 00:34:45,825
她说过她有个哥哥，在中央城
She said she had a brother in Central City.

465
00:34:46,098 --> 00:34:48,931
他在监狱里 阿曼达是唯一和他联系的人
He was in prison. She was the only person who kept in touch.

466
00:34:49,101 --> 00:34:50,864
在监狱里时，我就视她为我的生命
She was my lifeline when I was inside.

467
00:34:51,036 --> 00:34:53,300
可惜我没有个能把我从监狱里弄出来的富老爸
I never had a rich daddy to keep me out of jail.

468
00:34:53,772 --> 00:34:56,969
- 我不明白，你想要什么？ - 我要什么？我要什么？
-I don't understand. What do you want? -What do I want? What do I want?

469
00:34:57,142 --> 00:35:00,737
我要帮我妹妹复仇
I want vengeance for my sister.

470
00:35:03,048 --> 00:35:05,573
什么意思？阿曼达在哪？
What do you mean? Where's Amanda?

471
00:35:05,751 --> 00:35:07,878
她死了，莱克斯
She's dead, Lex.

472
00:35:08,053 --> 00:35:10,078
她一年前自杀了
She committed suicide a year ago.

473
00:35:13,091 --> 00:35:16,322
- 我没听说 - 那是因为你对她不管不顾
-I never knew. -That's because you cut her out of your life.

474
00:35:17,162 --> 00:35:21,326
零点俱乐部那事之后，她完全变了 裘德的死毁了她
She was never the same after Club Zero. Jude's death devastated her.

475
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:25,527
他是她生命中挚爱，你夺走了他
He was the love of her life. You took all that away.

476
00:35:26,305 --> 00:35:28,330
她失去了活下去的希望
She had nothing to live for.

477
00:35:31,276 --> 00:35:33,073
那是谁？
Who's that?

478
00:35:34,146 --> 00:35:36,273
意外的好运
Lucky break.

479
00:35:36,715 --> 00:35:40,515
阿曼达葬礼后几星期 我去布鲁德海文市的一家小餐馆
Couple weeks after Amanda's funeral, I walk into a greasy spoon in Bludhaven...

480
00:35:40,686 --> 00:35:44,520
在那碰到他，我都不敢相信 一个做汉堡的快餐厨师
...and there he is. I couldn't believe it. Short-order cook flipping burgers.

481
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:49,593
你听过“现实中会有另一个自己”的说法吗？ 连我都得仔细看看
You know how they say everyone in life has a double? I had to look twice.

482
00:35:50,295 --> 00:35:54,288
我在想，如果他能骗到我，也能骗到你
I figure if he can fool me, he can fool you.

483
00:35:56,935 --> 00:35:58,368
他为什么要这么做？
Why'd he do it?

484
00:35:59,471 --> 00:36:02,804
他在保释中，需要钱，我就有了这个想法
He was on parole, needed the money, and that's when I got the idea.

485
00:36:02,975 --> 00:36:07,105
你毁了我妹妹曼蒂的生活 我也要毁了你的
You ruined Mandy's life, I'd ruin yours.

486
00:36:07,779 --> 00:36:10,612
曼蒂终于能得到她应得的公正了
Mandy's finally gonna get the justice she deserves.

487
00:36:11,483 --> 00:36:13,508
你说对了，没错
You were right.

488
00:36:14,453 --> 00:36:19,618
报纸，警方笔录，和我对费伦所说的
You were right. The newspapers, the police reports, what I told Phelan.

489
00:36:19,958 --> 00:36:23,792
全是假的，你想要真相？我告诉你
They were all lies. You want the truth? I'll give it to you.

490
00:36:58,697 --> 00:37:02,758
- 不，你又在扭曲事实！ - 这就是真正发生的事！
-No, no, no. You're twisting it again! -That's what happened!

491
00:37:02,934 --> 00:37:05,061
这就是事实，阿曼达扣动了扳机
That's what happened. Amanda pulled the trigger.

492
00:37:05,237 --> 00:37:07,603
她杀了裘德 我隐瞒这一切都是为了保护她
She shot Jude. I was just trying to protect her.

493
00:37:07,773 --> 00:37:09,035
我受够你了，莱克斯！
I'm through with you, Lex!

494
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:13,107
杀了我，阿曼达也不会回来了
Killing me won't bring Amanda back.

495
00:37:13,312 --> 00:37:16,577
- 这一切都改变不了发生过的事 - 我不管
-None of this can change what happened. -I don't care.

496
00:37:16,748 --> 00:37:18,875
今晚之后，你不会再伤害任何人了
After tonight, you'll never hurt anyone else.

497
00:37:19,184 --> 00:37:21,675
你逃不了过去的，莱克斯
You can't escape your past, Lex.

498
00:37:40,739 --> 00:37:42,229
莱克斯！
Lex!

499
00:37:42,407 --> 00:37:44,466
趴下！楼上有人有枪
Get down! There's a man with a gun up there.

500
00:37:44,643 --> 00:37:47,134
哪里？你是说他？
Where? You mean that guy?

501
00:37:47,312 --> 00:37:50,975
- 发生了什么？ - 我不知道
-What happened? -I have no idea.

502
00:37:51,149 --> 00:37:53,413
你怎么找到我的？
How'd you find me here?

503
00:37:53,585 --> 00:37:55,348
靠我朋友的一点帮助
With a little help from my friends.

504
00:38:24,616 --> 00:38:28,814
- 你觉得怎么样？ - 我很惊讶
-So, what do you think? -I'm definitely surprised.

505
00:38:28,987 --> 00:38:30,682
我也是
Me too.

506
00:38:31,056 --> 00:38:32,853
克罗伊在哪？
Where's Chloe?

507
00:38:33,291 --> 00:38:36,454
她说要像明星一样，晚到一点
She said she wanted to be fashionably late.

508
00:38:39,431 --> 00:38:40,955
这个送给你
I got this for you.

509
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,091
别担心，不是断肢
Don't worry, it's not a body part.

510
00:38:45,904 --> 00:38:48,236
在阁楼上找到的，是我爷爷的
It was in the attic. It was my grandfather's.

511
00:38:48,407 --> 00:38:51,137
塔龙当年刚开张时照的
It was taken just after the Talon opened.

512
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:56,447
- 你可以把它挂在柜台上 - 克拉克，太惊喜了，谢谢
-Figured you could hang it above the counter. -Clark, it's amazing. Thank you.

513
00:38:57,416 --> 00:38:59,145
不用谢
You're welcome.

514
00:39:00,385 --> 00:39:02,785
我要回去做事了
I better get back to work.

515
00:39:03,321 --> 00:39:05,255
感觉怎么样？
How does it feel?

516
00:39:05,524 --> 00:39:10,291
- 有点怕，不要告诉别人 - 我会为你保守秘密的
-Terrifying. Don't tell anybody. -Your secret's safe with me.

517
00:39:21,606 --> 00:39:23,938
我感觉你在躲我，克拉克
I get the feeling you're avoiding me, Clark.

518
00:39:24,976 --> 00:39:27,911
我发现自己对你很不了解
I just realized there's a lot I don't know about you.

519
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,479
怕我不光彩的过去会影响你？
You think my dark past is gonna rub off on you?

520
00:39:33,652 --> 00:39:35,882
我撒谎说自己开的枪 是为了保护阿曼达
I was trying to protect Amanda.

521
00:39:36,054 --> 00:39:37,885
我爸爸根本不会去帮她…
My father wouldn't raise a finger to help her...

522
00:39:38,056 --> 00:39:40,115
…但我知道他肯定会尽量保护他独子的
...but I knew he'd do anything to save his only son.

523
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:43,687
所以你代人受罪，才掩盖了真相？
So you took the fall and everything was covered up?

524
00:39:44,129 --> 00:39:47,189
这是真正发生的事吗？这是真相吗？
Is that really what happened? Is it the truth?

525
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,336
真相就是，我会尽我所能去保护我的朋友
The truth is, I'd do anything to protect my friends.

526
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,336
