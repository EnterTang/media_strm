你相认我们能看到

46
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,825
你所知道的世界的未来吗
beyond the world as you know it?

47
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,795
我相信你做的就是在瞎扯蛋
I believe what you do is a load of crap.

恕我冒昧 先生

他得了病 病得很重

我们说话的时候他的灵魂就在这个屋子里

他是个Cuesta Verde大学的历史教授

72
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:56,041
你是个历史学教授
You're a history professor.

73
00:03:56,075 --> 00:03:58,043
为什么你不告诉他他爱他
Why don't you tell him he loves him?

74
00:03:58,077 --> 00:04:00,078
要知道他们都爱听到这个
You know they always love to hear that.

75
00:04:00,112 --> 00:04:02,447
他想让你知道

80
00:04:37,116 --> 00:04:39,317
你可真是个浪货 我告诉你
You're a hot piece of crumpet, I tell you.

81
00:04:39,351 --> 00:04:41,753
英语口音已经说够了
Enough with the English accent already.

82
00:04:41,787 --> 00:04:43,288
拜托 你说这能让你兴奋
Come on. You said it turns you on.

83
00:04:44,758 --> 00:04:46,859
是你让我兴奋
You turn me on.

84
00:04:48,962 --> 00:04:50,897
额的神 你还真是欲求不满啊
Jesus, you're insatiable.

85
00:07:59,921 --> 00:08:02,789
神奇奥秘可不是白叫的
They don't call me the Amazing Mysterium for nothing.

86
00:08:02,824 --> 00:08:04,625
别吹牛了
Don't flatter yourself.

87
00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:06,060
哦 上帝 你真是个贱货
Aw, Jesus, you're such a cunt.

88
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,461
你非要扫我的兴 是吗
You have to ruin it, don't you?

89
00:08:07,495 --> 00:08:09,330
你知道我正在经历一段艰难时期
You know I'm going through a rough patch.

90
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:11,098
更像一个没钱的时期
More like a broke patch.

91
00:08:11,132 --> 00:08:13,400
是啊 很不幸 我伟大的幻境
Yeah, unfortunately, my greatest illusion

92
00:08:13,435 --> 00:08:15,435
使得所有人都认为我很有钱
is making everybody think that I'm rich.

93
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,505
你知道吗 那不是我的问题
You know what? That's not my problem.

94
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:18,539
我需要更多的钱
I need more money.

95
00:08:18,573 --> 00:08:20,241
我也有开销啊 你知道
I have expenses, too, you know.

96
00:08:20,275 --> 00:08:22,343
你得到了门票收入的2.5%
You get two and a half percent of the gate,

97
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,044
加上这个活的所有其他额外收入
plus all the other perks of doing this job.

98
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,880
我想现在已经够多的了
I think that's enough for now.

99
00:08:25,914 --> 00:08:28,449
如果你把和你上床也当作额外收入 再考虑一下
If you consider fucking you a perk, think again.

100
00:08:28,483 --> 00:08:30,952
哦 拜托 说好听点儿 你就是个电话接线员
Oh, come on. You're a glorified phone operator.

101
00:08:30,986 --> 00:08:33,355
什么 你不就是挤了挤乳沟 露了点大腿吗
What, you show a little bit of cleavage, some leg?

102
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:35,256
谁都能干你的活
Anybody can do your job.

103
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,559
我认为你那份已经足够了 好吧
I think your cut is quite enough, all right?

104
00:08:37,593 --> 00:08:39,794
你给我听着 如果这事还是没有转机
You know what? If things don't change around here,

105
00:08:39,828 --> 00:08:41,830
我就把真相告诉所有人
I'm gonna tell everybody the truth

106
00:08:41,864 --> 00:08:44,832
关于你这个不神奇奥秘的一切
about the not-so-amazing Mysterium.

107
00:08:49,503 --> 00:08:53,039
把你的魔术棒从我面前拿开 不然我就给TMZ打电话
Get your magic wand out of my face or I'm calling TMZ.

108
00:08:49,503 --> 00:08:53,039
注：TMZ 全称Thirty Mile Zone 一个专门搜集名人的八卦和花边的网站

109
00:08:53,073 --> 00:08:55,708
你想毁了我吗 你不能
You're gonna ruin me? You can't.

110
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,610
我欠一屁股债 我需要那些钱
I'm in debt, and I need that money.

111
00:08:57,644 --> 00:08:59,679
你知道这里的房租
Do you realize how much the rent

112
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:01,715
和日常开销有多少吗
and the overhead is on this place?

113
00:09:03,852 --> 00:09:05,053
我明白最近的生意
I understand that things have

114
00:09:05,053 --> 00:09:06,254
变得有点萧条
been a little bit slow recently,

115
00:09:06,289 --> 00:09:08,256
而观众们不会像过去那样好忽悠了
but they don't just make suckers like they used to.

116
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,192
好吧 那些不是我的问题
Well, that's not my problem.

117
00:09:10,226 --> 00:09:12,461
拜托 你得再给我点时间
Come on. You've got to give me a little bit more time,

118
00:09:12,496 --> 00:09:14,697
那样我们才能重新谈
then we can renegotiate.

119
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:17,701
时间到了
Time's up.

120
00:09:19,137 --> 00:09:22,039
你知道 那不是个好态度 Tara
You know, that's not a very healthy attitude, Tara.

121
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:27,177
我对你的把戏感到恶心
I am so sick of your tricks.

122
00:09:27,212 --> 00:09:29,546
别他妈威胁我
Don't you threaten me.

123
00:09:29,581 --> 00:09:31,015
这不是恶作剧
This is not a trick.

124
00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:33,350
我会让你永远消失
I'm gonna make you disappear forever.

125
00:11:01,607 --> 00:11:03,425
读心术是一种表演艺术
Mentalism is a performing art

126
00:11:03,425 --> 00:11:05,244
那些从业者能够表现出
whose practitioners demonstrate

127
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:08,748
高度发达的精神力和准确的直觉
highly developed mental and intuitive abilities

128
00:11:08,782 --> 00:11:12,486
比如说传心术 千里眼 心灵控制
such as telepathy, clairvoyance, and mind control.

129
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,555
Foster Prentiss 神奇奥秘
Foster Prentiss, the Amazing Mysterium,

130
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,858
压根儿就没这种能力

131
00:11:17,892 --> 00:11:21,395
他是个彻头彻尾的骗子
He is a complete and utter fraud.

132
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,966
不幸的是 压根就没有假的谋杀案这么一说

133
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,903
Foster会不惜一切代价得到他想要的东西
Foster will stop at nothing to get what he wants

134

and must put on a performance of a lifetime.

135
00:11:31,474 --> 00:11:33,408
也许这次
But maybe this time,

136
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,577
他会被人算计
the ruse is on him.

137
00:12:28,801 --> 00:12:31,135
有什么需要吗
Can I help you?

138
00:12:32,471 --> 00:12:34,372
我想我们能互相帮助

我看了你得表演 你棒极了
I've seen your act. You're very good.

141

但如果你得到合理的帮助的话 你会变得很伟大
But you could be great with the right help.

142
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,082

我穿渔网袜很好看
I look fabulous in fishnets

144
00:12:47,986 --> 00:12:50,087
但不穿更漂亮
and even better without them.

145
00:12:50,122 --> 00:12:53,157
你难道不考虑下让我试镜
Won't you consider letting me audition,

146
00:12:53,192 --> 00:12:55,927
或者至少递给我那条浴巾
or at least fetching me that towel?

147
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:42,839
顺便说一下 我叫Jessica

很高兴见到你 Jessica

你的推荐信无可挑剔

两者都很完美
Both of them.

152
00:14:14,406 --> 00:14:17,175
好了 我压根儿就不需要有幻觉
Well, I don't have to have visions

153
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:20,078
就知道你注定会有所成就 Prentiss
to know you're destined for great things, Prentiss.

154
00:14:20,112 --> 00:14:23,614
我只想做那伟大成功中的一小部分
I just want to be a small part of that success.

155
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:25,550
多小
How small?

156
00:14:26,952 --> 00:14:29,025
我不想成为那个杀了下金蛋的鹅的人
I don't want to be the one to kill the golden goose.

157
00:14:29,287 --> 00:14:31,889
我认为那足以满足每个人的要求
I think there's enough to go around for everyone.

158
00:14:31,923 --> 00:14:34,157
你确定
You sure about that?

159
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:42,132
你读我的想法吧
Read my mind.

160
00:14:42,167 --> 00:14:45,269
唉 我认为那不是你的想法
Yeah, I don't think that's your mind.

161
00:14:45,304 --> 00:14:47,372
我知道如何得到
I know how to score

162
00:14:47,406 --> 00:14:49,374
一大笔现金
some serious cash,

163
00:14:49,408 --> 00:14:52,044
但是我需要你的帮助
but I need you help.

164
00:14:54,047 --> 00:14:57,016
我被介绍认识了一个有钱的老女人

她女儿失踪了

166
00:14:58,886 --> 00:15:00,620
她猜想可能死了

167
00:15:00,654 --> 00:15:02,755
她想和她女儿谈话
She wants to communicate with

168
00:15:02,755 --> 00:15:04,857
在另一个世界交流下

169
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,095
你觉得你能为她们联络上吗
Think you can connect them?

170
00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:11,564
恩 我想我可以

171
00:15:13,034 --> 00:15:15,335
你要做的就是让那老女人确信
All you gotta do is convince her

172
00:15:15,369 --> 00:15:17,571
你可以和另一个世界交流
you can communicate with the afterworld,

173
00:15:17,605 --> 00:15:19,706
只要给她们个交流的机会
set up a private reading,

174
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,708
她就会付钱
and she'll pay...

175
00:15:21,742 --> 00:15:23,409
好吧
big time.

176
00:15:23,444 --> 00:15:25,478
这很有意思
It's very interesting.

177
00:15:25,513 --> 00:15:28,482
你跟你简历里的照片一点儿都不一样
You don't look anything like your profile picture.

178
00:15:28,516 --> 00:15:31,318
你真的是个医生吗
Are you really a doctor?

179
00:15:31,353 --> 00:15:33,954
不是
No.

180
00:15:33,989 --> 00:15:36,791
你真的是个鬼神学家吗
Are you really a demonologist?

181
00:15:36,825 --> 00:15:38,159
是的
Yes.

182
00:15:38,194 --> 00:15:40,228
好给力
Cool.

183
00:15:52,174 --> 00:15:54,142
那些神奇奥秘到底要做些什么
And how can the Amazing Mysterium

184
00:15:54,177 --> 00:15:57,212
才会让你吃惊呢 亲爱的

190
00:16:10,624 --> 00:16:12,658
别人都不知道的事
that nobody else knows.

191
00:16:14,527 --> 00:16:16,695

抱歉 我觉得我好像
I'm sorry. I feel like I'm being

196
00:16:32,761 --> 00:16:34,346
被那双美丽的眼睛分散了注意力
distracted by those lovely eyes.

197
00:16:36,049 --> 00:16:38,784
额 给我点时间集中精力

读心如此困难的状况

221
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,985
失配一下 女士们先生们

中场休息

我看到了她的过去 我看到她以前干过的事情
I saw her, I saw what she did,

225
00:18:34,383 --> 00:18:36,635
而且我看到她杀了一个男人

229
00:18:46,412 --> 00:18:48,413

230
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,781

00:18:55,688 --> 00:18:57,422
没有人杀人了
Nobody killed anybody.

234
00:18:57,456 --> 00:19:00,091
你什么都没有看见
You didn't see anything.

235
00:19:00,126 --> 00:19:02,760
那简直是天方夜谈
That was incredible.

236
00:19:02,795 --> 00:19:05,662
不管怎样 你的骗局起作用了
Whatever hell scam you're pulling is working.

237
00:19:09,667 --> 00:19:11,701
你看见外面那些人脸上的表情么

238
00:19:11,736 --> 00:19:14,971
他们开始相信了

239
00:19:15,006 --> 00:19:18,207
是的 不 不  这不是骗局

我感觉到的事是真实的
What I felt out there was real.

241
00:19:21,512 --> 00:19:24,214
当然是真的
Sure it was.

242
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:29,252
但现在 你需要把精力放在工作上
But now...you gotta keep your eye on the prize.

243
00:19:29,286 --> 00:19:32,555
如果我们想要敲那富太太一笔的话
If we're gonna score any of that rich bitch's cash,

244
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:34,824
她需要被确保
she needs to be believe

245
00:19:34,858 --> 00:19:37,960
你能够跟她死去的女儿交谈
that you can talk to her dead daughter.

246
00:19:39,162 --> 00:19:43,665
所以出去完成这该死的表演

很好 你已经很好的恢复过来 女士
Well, you've certainly recovered splendidly, ladies,

250
00:19:53,811 --> 00:19:56,713
自从你春天去
from your spring break trip to...

251
00:19:56,747 --> 00:19:59,081
San Padre 我相信
San Padre, I believe.

252
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:01,301
不 你真不应该
No, you really shouldn't have got

253
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:03,486
把那下流的纹身纹在你的
that nasty tattoo down on your...

254
00:20:03,521 --> 00:20:05,655
我不会对任何人说的
I'm not gonna say in front of everybody.

255
00:20:07,425 --> 00:20:11,695
并且 不 不要告诉你的父亲

晚上好
Good evening.

257
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,882
我懂了 沉默以对
I get it. The silent treatment.

258
00:20:31,917 --> 00:20:34,418
因为你不相信
Is that because you don't believe,

259
00:20:34,453 --> 00:20:36,854
亦或者怕被人知道你做过的事情吗
or is that because you do?

260
00:20:38,056 --> 00:20:40,091
没关系的 你不需要告诉我什么
It's okay. You don't have to talk.

261
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:43,327
我很健谈的
I'm very gregarious.

262
00:20:45,932 --> 00:20:48,733
Hey 我是Jay Roma  这里是Crazy Chixx

267
00:21:01,481 --> 00:21:03,015
耶  不 我没有

268
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,584
你灌醉我了
You got me drunk.

269
00:21:04,618 --> 00:21:08,021
随后你毁了我们的人生
And then you ruined our lives.

270
00:21:10,792 --> 00:21:14,362
我们不得不从学校退学 改名字
We had to drop out of school, change our names,

271
00:21:14,396 --> 00:21:16,698
不管我们搬到哪里做过什么

272
00:21:16,732 --> 00:21:19,434
我们不能摆脱我们因为你做过的事情

273
00:21:19,468 --> 00:21:22,503
我们全被你录像了
We all appeared in your videos.

274
00:21:22,537 --> 00:21:24,872
现在该轮到你被我们录像了
Now it's your turn to be in ours.

275
00:21:24,906 --> 00:21:26,940
你们想要干什么

276
00:21:26,975 --> 00:21:30,443

278
00:21:53,802 --> 00:21:56,905
所以你看到的那个男人是Jay Roma

279
00:21:56,939 --> 00:21:58,740
他创办了Crazy Chixx

几个月前他被谋杀了

281
00:22:00,776 --> 00:22:03,277
他死亡的视频流传到网上了
