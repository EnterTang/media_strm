<i>Previously on "Gravity"...</i>

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,329
Diego didn't know the right where to
talk the people who he owed money to.

3
00:00:05,363 --> 00:00:07,597
As a result, they didn't
leave him much of a face.

4
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:10,634
Trying to kill yourself
to be with your dead wife.

5
00:00:10,668 --> 00:00:13,037
I'll take good care of him.
And you won't be forgotten.

6
00:00:13,071 --> 00:00:15,639
I thought you should know.
I can't have kids.

7
00:00:15,673 --> 00:00:17,908
- Adam Rosenblum. I'm
Shawna's boyfriend. - Boyfriend?

8
00:00:17,942 --> 00:00:19,909
I got a bigger dick
because I thought

9
00:00:19,944 --> 00:00:21,545
That it would help me
to find true love.

10
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:23,813
Filthiest colon I've ever seen.
What is that, a cheeto?

11
00:00:23,848 --> 00:00:26,884
This... is... your... man.

12
00:00:26,918 --> 00:00:29,619
There's no detective
Miller on the NYPD.

13
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:31,354
Well, who comes up
with that badge number?

14
00:00:31,388 --> 00:00:32,322
No one.

You're kind of
scaring me a little bit.

19
00:00:47,471 --> 00:00:48,938
Call me "hombre."

20
00:00:48,973 --> 00:00:50,607
Why?

21
00:00:50,641 --> 00:00:51,908
Just do it.

22
00:00:51,942 --> 00:00:53,109
Hombre?

23
00:00:53,144 --> 00:00:54,844
I like that.

24
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:02,018
When you said you didn't
want to have kids,

25
00:01:02,053 --> 00:01:03,453
Was that because
you couldn't

26
00:01:03,487 --> 00:01:05,188
Or 'cause...

27
00:01:05,222 --> 00:01:06,890
You wouldn't want to
anyway?

28
00:01:06,924 --> 00:01:11,695
I really want kids.

29
00:01:14,765 --> 00:01:16,032
Do you?

30
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:20,170
Yes.

31
00:01:20,204 --> 00:01:24,374
Let's start trying
right now.

32
00:01:24,408 --> 00:01:25,809
Hey, I thought you couldn't.

33
00:01:25,843 --> 00:01:27,877
Well, I can't,

34
00:01:27,912 --> 00:01:31,281
But right after
we make love,

35
00:01:31,315 --> 00:01:33,550
We could go online

36
00:01:33,584 --> 00:01:38,922
And pick out a cute little
brown or yellow one.

37
00:01:38,956 --> 00:01:40,223
Yeah, sure, why not?

38
00:01:54,472 --> 00:01:55,438
Mom, what?

39
00:01:55,473 --> 00:01:57,774
Hello, Adam.
Where are you?

40
00:01:57,808 --> 00:01:59,876
I told you. Mom, I told you.
I'm at a friend's house.

41
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,845
It sounds like
you're whispering.

42
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,079
Why are you whispering?

43
00:02:03,114 --> 00:02:06,716
No, I'm whispering because
he has an inner ear infection.

44
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,752
Inner ear infe...
well, is that contagious?

45
00:02:08,786 --> 00:02:10,286
No, it's not contagious.

46
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:12,455
Now, hold on
while I google it.

47
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,023
Now, you know I prefer
to use webmd.

48
00:02:14,058 --> 00:02:15,725
What? Now I can't hear you.
May... maybe it is contagious.

49
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,594
Well, perhaps you can't hear me
because you're having symptoms of...

50
00:02:17,628 --> 00:02:18,595
Bye.

51
00:02:21,732 --> 00:02:23,399
I'm surprised
it wasn't your mom

52
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:25,502
That was discovered
in your dad's trunk.

53
00:02:27,271 --> 00:02:29,939
Wait,
maybe that's not funny.

54
00:02:51,595 --> 00:02:53,596
You want some of this, papi?

55
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:56,699
Come and get it.

56
00:02:56,734 --> 00:02:58,101
It hurts so good.

57
00:02:58,135 --> 00:02:59,836
It hurts so good.

58
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,673
You like that?

59
00:03:03,707 --> 00:03:06,142
This is part of this body, baby.

60
00:03:06,177 --> 00:03:08,978
You like my tight little ass?
Well, you gotta earn it, baby.

61
00:03:09,013 --> 00:03:10,814
That nipple's for you.

62
00:03:10,848 --> 00:03:13,216
Go ahead.

63
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,218
No.
Nipple's not for you.

64
00:03:15,252 --> 00:03:16,786
Damn, I'm pretty, man.

65
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:21,391
I threw my purse at your head
when we first me.

66
00:03:21,425 --> 00:03:23,393
Why'd you do that?

67
00:03:23,427 --> 00:03:26,396
Because from the moment you told
your story, I wanted in.

68
00:03:54,024 --> 00:03:55,458
What's your name?

69
00:03:55,492 --> 00:03:57,126
Evil.

70
00:03:57,161 --> 00:03:58,261
And yours?

71
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,032
"fuckin' happy."
all right. And you?

72
00:04:03,067 --> 00:04:06,236
No? Okay. It's okay.

73
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,338
You guys ever been to
"the rocky horror picture show"?

74
00:04:08,372 --> 00:04:10,206
As if. Posers.

75
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:11,808
Dress-up freaks.

76
00:04:11,842 --> 00:04:13,109
Really?

77
00:04:13,143 --> 00:04:15,912
I kind of got into it one
summer back when I was your age.

78
00:04:15,946 --> 00:04:18,181
I thought
it was kind of cool.

79
00:04:18,215 --> 00:04:21,317
I think it's still playing
at midnight on the weekends.

80
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,821
You're good kids.

81
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,124
But I'd really
appreciate it

82
00:04:28,158 --> 00:04:30,026
If you didn't hang out
around here anymore.

83
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,529
Because you represent a part
of my life that really did...

84
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:34,998
Die.

85
00:04:36,433 --> 00:04:38,101
Okay?

86
00:04:40,938 --> 00:04:44,007
Okay.

87
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,675
Okay.

88
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:47,043
Thanks.

89
00:04:47,077 --> 00:04:49,412
Well, if we did go
to "Rocky horror,"

90
00:04:49,446 --> 00:04:52,415
Would you come with us...
just once?

91
00:04:54,652 --> 00:04:56,886
Sure.

92
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,421
Just once.

93
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,491
Okay.

94
00:05:02,993 --> 00:05:04,861
I love you!

95
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,630
Oh, my God!

96
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:14,337
Mr. Champagne,
thank you for seeing me.

97
00:05:14,371 --> 00:05:15,905
I appreciate it.
I'm detective Miller, NYPD.

98
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,440
How do you do?

99
00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:19,776
What is this about?

100
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,244
Not some D.U.I., I hope.

101
00:05:21,278 --> 00:05:24,447
I did the community service.
I reported it correctly.

102
00:05:24,481 --> 00:05:26,382
No, this is a completely
different matter.

103
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:28,284
May I have a seat?
Yeah. Be my guest.

104
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,519
Thank you.

105
00:05:32,589 --> 00:05:34,090
Gotta say, you're
scaring me a little bit.

106
00:05:34,124 --> 00:05:37,727
Did you establish a trust for a
boy named Cary MacDougal in 1982?

107
00:05:37,761 --> 00:05:39,095
He would have been 10
at the time.

108
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:41,531
I don't know.

109
00:05:41,565 --> 00:05:43,366
Did something happen
to this boy or...?

110
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,934
Did you establish a trust
for him?

111
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,970
Well, you know, you and I
have to establish a little trust

112
00:05:47,004 --> 00:05:48,738
Before I'm gonna talk
about a thing like that.

113
00:05:48,772 --> 00:05:50,406
I have no idea
what's going on.

114
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:53,042
We're investigating
the death of his mother.

115
00:05:57,047 --> 00:05:58,815
Do you know her?

116
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:00,450
No.

117
00:06:00,484 --> 00:06:03,519
No, I can't say that I do.
I'm sorry.

118
00:06:03,554 --> 00:06:06,823
Did you establish a trust
for her son?

119
00:06:06,857 --> 00:06:08,591
Well, you know,
to be perfectly honest,

120
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,227
You know,
I would have to check.

121
00:06:11,261 --> 00:06:12,628
As you must know,

122
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:15,398
I do establish trusts

123
00:06:15,432 --> 00:06:20,069
For kids that are in
foster care, state-raised.

124
00:06:20,104 --> 00:06:23,039
Give them a chance at something,
maybe go to college.

125
00:06:23,073 --> 00:06:25,274
I'm just curious.
Why do you do that?

126
00:06:25,309 --> 00:06:28,978
Because, if you must know,
that's the way I was raised.

127
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,346
That's very generous
of you.

128
00:06:30,381 --> 00:06:31,781
We do what we can.

129
00:06:31,815 --> 00:06:33,316
So you don't know offhand,
really,

130
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,885
If you established a trust for this
particular boy... Cary MacDougal.

131
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,788
No, detective,
but like I said, I can check.

132
00:06:38,822 --> 00:06:40,790
I will check for you.
I'd be happy to check.

133
00:06:40,824 --> 00:06:42,058
I appreciate that.

134
00:06:42,092 --> 00:06:44,861
But you feel certain
that you don't know his mother?

135
00:06:44,895 --> 00:06:47,230
No, I do not know
his mother, no.

136
00:06:47,264 --> 00:06:49,699
How do you think
your fingerprints

137
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:51,367
Ended up in her apartment,
then?

138
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,839
That's impossible.

139
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,775
You must be mistaken.

140
00:06:58,809 --> 00:07:00,943
I've been working this case
for a long time.

141
00:07:00,978 --> 00:07:03,579
We always had fingerprints,
and we never a match.

142
00:07:03,614 --> 00:07:06,983
Last year, you had a d.U.I.,
and then we had a match.

143
00:07:07,017 --> 00:07:08,751
When did this woman die?

144
00:07:08,786 --> 00:07:11,287
1982, the year
you did or didn't

145
00:07:11,321 --> 00:07:14,190
Establish a trust fund
for her son.

146
00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:16,526
Well,
that's a long time ago.

147
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,862
There are still some people
who haven't forgotten her

148
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,465
And who care very much
about who killed her.

149
00:07:22,499 --> 00:07:23,699
Yeah,
I'm not comfortable

150
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:25,635
Having this conversation
anymore, detective.

151
00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:27,036
I still
feel like talking.

152
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:31,707
Well, then I'm gonna have to
speak to an attorney.

153
00:07:41,385 --> 00:07:43,453
Yeah, hi.
It's B.C.

154
00:07:43,487 --> 00:07:44,954
You're not gonna need
your lawyer today.

155
00:07:44,988 --> 00:07:46,956
But keep him nearby.
I'll have some more questions.

156
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,225
I'll be in touch.
Thank you for your time.

157
00:08:04,141 --> 00:08:06,075
Sorry to keep you waiting,
detective Miller,

158
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,710
But one of my nurses
is retiring,

159
00:08:07,744 --> 00:08:09,212
And she wanted
a pizza party.

160
00:08:09,246 --> 00:08:11,514
I offered to throw her
something more extravagant,

161
00:08:11,548 --> 00:08:14,016
But she insisted on pizza,
so...Would you like a slice?

162
00:08:14,051 --> 00:08:15,651
No, thanks.
So what's up?

163
00:08:15,686 --> 00:08:17,620
Drink?
No, thank you.

164
00:08:17,654 --> 00:08:19,822
Well...

165
00:08:19,857 --> 00:08:21,691
We...

166
00:08:21,725 --> 00:08:23,993
Would you mind
holding that?

167
00:08:24,027 --> 00:08:25,862
Thanks.

168
00:08:25,896 --> 00:08:29,966
We... did a liver biopsy
on you, right?

169
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,901
A colonoscopy. That's right. I'm sorry.

170
00:08:31,935 --> 00:08:33,903
Sorry, it's Friday afternoon.
Okay, okay.

171
00:08:33,937 --> 00:08:36,005
It's Friday afternoon.
I had a couple of those.

172
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,773
And my mind's already
on college football.

173
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,675
You a college-football fan? Yeah.

174
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,843
You in a pool?
No.

175
00:08:40,878 --> 00:08:42,111
Wanna join mine?
No!

176
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,713
All right.
What are my test results?

177
00:08:43,747 --> 00:08:45,014
I know. I know.
Believe me.

178
00:08:45,048 --> 00:08:47,250
No one cares about it
more than me.

179
00:08:47,284 --> 00:08:48,384
Okay.

180
00:08:48,418 --> 00:08:50,520
Oh. All right.

181
00:08:50,554 --> 00:08:53,222
What do we have here?

182
00:08:58,462 --> 00:09:00,363
Thank you for coming.
How are you?

183
00:09:00,397 --> 00:09:04,367
Around your neck, please.

184
00:09:04,401 --> 00:09:06,602
Dogg, how are you?
Very good.

185
00:09:06,637 --> 00:09:07,904
Here you go.

186
00:09:11,575 --> 00:09:13,809
What's the significance
of the pictures?

187
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:17,113
Well, everyone's story is
on the bottom of their picture,

188
00:09:17,147 --> 00:09:18,848
And I'm gonna pin it
to the clothes.

189
00:09:18,882 --> 00:09:21,484
So they aren't just
nameless old garments,

190
00:09:21,518 --> 00:09:22,818
But they're
living reminders

191
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,520
Of the people
who aren't here anymore.

192
00:09:24,555 --> 00:09:25,655
I like it.

193
00:09:26,657 --> 00:09:28,925
Oh, here! Try this.
They're really good.

194
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,260
I hear they're amazing.

195
00:09:31,295 --> 00:09:33,462
Mmm. Mmm!
Oh, that's good.

196
00:09:36,433 --> 00:09:38,367
Hate it.

197
00:09:38,402 --> 00:09:41,504
Why? It reminds me of my aunt mildred.

198
00:09:41,538 --> 00:09:43,873
It's a very fine line
that we walk here, you know.

199
00:09:43,907 --> 00:09:45,641
What does that mean?

200
00:09:45,676 --> 00:09:48,511
I've seen a lot of life,
you know?

201
00:09:48,545 --> 00:09:50,980
And, over time,
you will come to understand

202
00:09:51,014 --> 00:09:53,649
That there are just gonna be
days when our pace is off.

203
00:09:53,684 --> 00:09:56,619
But don't worry, darling.
I will be patient with you.

204
00:09:57,654 --> 00:09:59,855
Okay.

205
00:10:02,593 --> 00:10:03,726
Toast?

206
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,895
To what?

207
00:10:05,929 --> 00:10:08,264
Second chance.

208
00:10:08,298 --> 00:10:12,001
Second chance.

209
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,007
I'm gonna go see
how Lily's doing.

210
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,475
Robert?

211
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:22,044
Don't fuck her over.

212
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,080
Be sure.

213
00:10:24,114 --> 00:10:26,849
You know I'm not for these
inter-group relationships.

214
00:10:26,883 --> 00:10:28,451
I'm against that 24/7.

215
00:10:28,485 --> 00:10:30,786
And if you tell her
we had this conversation,

216
00:10:30,821 --> 00:10:32,855
I'm gonna have to
kill you,

217
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:35,491
And I'm against that 24/7
even more.

218
00:10:37,194 --> 00:10:40,196
* every single time I see you *

219
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:43,065
* my heart's on fire,
'cause you inspire *

220
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,769
Seems like
a huge success.

221
00:10:46,803 --> 00:10:50,006
It's so surreal to me.

222
00:10:52,576 --> 00:10:54,977
Are you missing someone?

223
00:10:55,012 --> 00:10:58,748
No.

224
00:10:58,782 --> 00:11:01,384
There's something
that I want to say

225
00:11:01,418 --> 00:11:03,352
That...

226
00:11:03,387 --> 00:11:05,087
I haven't said.

227
00:11:07,624 --> 00:11:09,525
Oh, God, I feel like
I'm the bachelorette.

228
00:11:11,028 --> 00:11:13,262
Do you think they throw
up and just cut it out?

229
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,697
You watch
"the bachelorette"?

230
00:11:14,731 --> 00:11:15,898
Yeah, everybody does.

231
00:11:15,932 --> 00:11:18,968
Lesbians, punks, chicks
in prison... everybody does.

232
00:11:19,002 --> 00:11:20,503
If they say they don't,
they're lying.

233
00:11:23,073 --> 00:11:25,775
As you were saying?

234
00:11:27,177 --> 00:11:29,111
He's here.

235
00:11:32,115 --> 00:11:33,215
Lily.

236
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,818
Dad.

237
00:11:35,852 --> 00:11:37,953
How do you do?

238
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,188
I'm Robert.

239
00:11:39,222 --> 00:11:41,991
I'm sorry.
Dad, this is...

240
00:11:42,025 --> 00:11:42,992
Robert.

241
00:11:43,026 --> 00:11:46,228
...Robert collingsworth,
my...

242
00:11:47,698 --> 00:11:49,131
...My boyfriend.

243
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,634
Well...

244
00:11:51,668 --> 00:11:55,805
You are a very unique man,
Mr. Robert collingsworth.

245
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,342
Tell me something about
my daughter that I don't know.

246
00:11:59,376 --> 00:12:01,844
I'm curious because,

247
00:12:01,878 --> 00:12:04,747
Well, my daughter's
never had a boyfriend before.

248
00:12:04,781 --> 00:12:06,849
So something.

249
00:12:06,883 --> 00:12:08,951
Anything.

250
00:12:08,985 --> 00:12:12,888
Well...

251
00:12:12,923 --> 00:12:15,324
She has your work ethic,
I imagine.

252
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:19,528
I love that I never know
what she's gonna say next.

253
00:12:21,732 --> 00:12:22,865
And she's soft.

254
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:25,901
She's softer
than even she knows.

255
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:31,240
Very sensitive.

256
00:12:31,274 --> 00:12:32,875
And despite all that,

257
00:12:32,909 --> 00:12:36,178
She's got the greatest capacity
for forgiveness

258
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,547
Of anyone
that I've ever met.

259
00:12:42,719 --> 00:12:44,920
I'm sorry, I didn't really
answer your question,

260
00:12:44,955 --> 00:12:46,055
Did I, Mr. Champagne?

261
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:47,723
You knew all that
already, right?

262
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,894
Yes.

263
00:12:51,928 --> 00:12:54,897
She's just like
her mother.

264
00:12:54,931 --> 00:12:57,700
I am?

265
00:12:57,734 --> 00:12:59,502
Mr. Champagne...

266
00:12:59,536 --> 00:13:03,105
Maybe you can tell me something
that only you know

267
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,440
About your daughter.

268
00:13:04,474 --> 00:13:06,776
I'm gonna take "conversations
more appropriately had

269
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,245
When Lily's not standing
right here" for 500, please.

270
00:13:11,148 --> 00:13:13,616
Can I have everybody's
attention, please?

271
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:16,252
I would like
to make a toast

272
00:13:16,286 --> 00:13:18,087
To Lily's story.

273
00:13:18,121 --> 00:13:21,624
If it wasn't for Lily,
there would be no story.

274
00:13:21,658 --> 00:13:24,660
Right? So...Lily?

275
00:13:24,694 --> 00:13:26,228
Thank God.
Excuse me.

276
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,463
Hey. Congratulations.
This is great.

277
00:13:27,497 --> 00:13:28,831
Hey.
I'm so glad you came.

278
00:13:28,865 --> 00:13:30,599
I can't... I can't stay long.
I'm not really a party guy.

279
00:13:30,634 --> 00:13:32,067
What are you talking about?
No.

280
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,803
Get some... get some champagne
and food, and we'll hang out.

281
00:13:33,837 --> 00:13:34,904
Okay?

282
00:13:34,938 --> 00:13:37,406
Congratulations.

283
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,608
- Are you wearing mascara?
- No, no.

284
00:13:39,643 --> 00:13:41,577
No.

285
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,315
So...

286
00:13:46,349 --> 00:13:50,019
Everyone that matters to me
is in this room.

287
00:13:50,053 --> 00:13:52,621
I almost didn't get
to have this story.

288
00:13:52,656 --> 00:13:57,092
But thanks to all of you...

289
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,628
My friends and my...

290
00:13:59,663 --> 00:14:01,397
I'm sorry.
I can't breathe.

291
00:14:01,431 --> 00:14:02,932
What?
What?

292
00:14:02,966 --> 00:14:04,767
I can't breathe! Oh, my God.

293
00:14:04,801 --> 00:14:06,735
Oh, it must have been nuts.
She's allergic to nuts!

294
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:07,903
Call 911!

295
00:14:07,938 --> 00:14:08,971
She's going into
anaphylactic shock.

296
00:14:09,005 --> 00:14:10,039
Do you have an epipen?

297
00:14:10,073 --> 00:14:11,941
My bag. It's...
it's in her bag!

298
00:14:11,975 --> 00:14:13,676
Are you okay?
What's the matter?

299
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:14,710
Honey, what color is it?!

300
00:14:14,744 --> 00:14:16,445
It's okay.

301
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,546
I can't find it!

302
00:14:17,581 --> 00:14:19,415
Okay, I don't...
I don't have time for this.

303
00:14:19,449 --> 00:14:23,352
I'm taking her to st. Luke's.
It's five minutes away.

304
00:14:24,754 --> 00:14:27,389
Get my... get my b...
the back door! Back door!

305
00:14:31,628 --> 00:14:33,229
Carla...

306
00:14:33,263 --> 00:14:35,798
Tell Samantha
I love her, okay?

307
00:14:35,832 --> 00:14:37,333
Tell her I love her.

308
00:14:41,638 --> 00:14:43,506
Wait, Lily,
I didn't mean it like that.

309
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,508
I didn't mean it
like that!

310
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:57,686
I think she needs to be
by herself now, Robert.

311
00:14:57,721 --> 00:14:59,388
Oh, really?
Do you, Miller?

312
00:14:59,422 --> 00:15:00,823
Look, not now, okay?

313
00:15:00,857 --> 00:15:03,559
Look,
she's gonna understand.

314
00:15:03,593 --> 00:15:05,594
You didn't mean
what you said.

315
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:07,162
Right?

316
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:10,165
Well, that's a conversation for
me to have with my girlfriend.

317
00:15:11,401 --> 00:15:12,468
That remains to be seen,

318
00:15:12,502 --> 00:15:14,503
But I think you agree
that now is certainly

319
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,672
Not the time to have
that conversation, right?

320
00:15:16,706 --> 00:15:19,742
Don't you have a down doggy
to do somewhere?

321
00:15:19,776 --> 00:15:21,677
She's strong, Ralph.

322
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:23,546
I mean, look at what
she's been through.

323
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:26,715
If there's anyone
who can get through this...

324
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:33,589
It's good news.
She's gonna be fine.

325
00:15:33,623 --> 00:15:35,391
Oh, God!

326
00:15:35,425 --> 00:15:37,826
Oh, thank you.
Thank God.

327
00:15:39,062 --> 00:15:41,163
She just needs to rest.

328
00:15:44,467 --> 00:15:46,201
As long as I live,

329
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,971
I never want to
fucking see you again.

330
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:51,507
Wait.

331
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,943
Let's go.

332
00:15:56,546 --> 00:15:58,948
Thank you.
Thank God.

333
00:16:07,991 --> 00:16:11,360
So, I make these
really, really good

334
00:16:11,394 --> 00:16:13,128
Vegan
chocolate-chocolate chip,

335
00:16:13,163 --> 00:16:15,864
Peanut butter,
banana cookies.

336
00:16:22,005 --> 00:16:24,206
"Super stupid."

337
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,600
Mother?

338
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:52,901
Hello!

339
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:58,240
Mother, not really
the best time.

340
00:16:58,274 --> 00:17:01,143
I'm your mother.
It's never the best time.

341
00:17:02,612 --> 00:17:07,950
I didn't think I could ever
let go of Samantha.

342
00:17:07,984 --> 00:17:10,653
But now I think I can.

343
00:17:10,687 --> 00:17:13,022
I adore Lily.

344
00:17:13,056 --> 00:17:15,391
I wanted you to know.

345
00:17:15,425 --> 00:17:18,661
Try not
to let this one die.

346
00:17:31,274 --> 00:17:33,575
The Miller lives
in swanky town.

347
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:34,910
Who knew?

348
00:17:34,944 --> 00:17:38,213
Yeah. Wasn't that swanky
when I bought it 20 years ago.

349
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,253
So, I melt down
baker's chocolate

350
00:18:18,288 --> 00:18:19,855
And maple syrup
when I'm making

351
00:18:19,889 --> 00:18:21,490
Chocolate-chocolate-chip
version,

352
00:18:21,524 --> 00:18:23,759
And when I'm just making
regular chocolate-chip,

353
00:18:23,793 --> 00:18:27,296
I do the same thing, but I
don't add the melted chocolate.

354
00:18:29,132 --> 00:18:31,700
Would you like to save any
to bake or...?

355
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,469
Maybe, maybe not.

356
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,041
So, do you believe in God?

357
00:18:39,075 --> 00:18:42,611
I believe...

358
00:18:42,645 --> 00:18:44,379
Half the time,
I believe in something.

359
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:45,914
I don't know
exactly what it is.

360
00:18:45,949 --> 00:18:47,783
I wasn't raised any religion
or anything.

361
00:18:47,817 --> 00:18:49,585
But some kind
of spiritual thing,

362
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:52,788
'cause I just feel, magic,

363
00:18:52,822 --> 00:18:54,790
You know,
too much of the time

364
00:18:54,824 --> 00:18:56,458
Not to believe
in something.

365
00:18:56,493 --> 00:19:00,729
But then other times,
I feel with complete certainty

366
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:03,999
That there's nothing
and that we just live and die,

367
00:19:04,033 --> 00:19:06,802
And once we die,
it's just over.

368
00:19:06,836 --> 00:19:08,704
And...

369
00:19:08,738 --> 00:19:10,506
That scares the shit
out of me.

370
00:19:12,108 --> 00:19:14,143
Yeah, me too.

371
00:19:21,351 --> 00:19:23,252
I have cancer.

372
00:19:23,286 --> 00:19:26,688
Why would you joke
about something like that now?

373
00:19:26,723 --> 00:19:29,324
I'm not.

374
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:31,226
I'm sorry.

375
00:19:31,261 --> 00:19:33,762
I realize it probably seems
selfish to bring it up

376
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,831
In light of what's happened
tonight,

377
00:19:35,865 --> 00:19:37,933
But...

378
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,909
I just don't have
anyone to tell.

379
00:19:46,943 --> 00:19:49,711
Where is it?

380
00:19:49,746 --> 00:19:51,780
It's in my stomach.

381
00:19:53,383 --> 00:19:56,785
I've been so lonely
my whole life.

382
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,989
And now it's eating up...
My insides.

383
00:20:01,024 --> 00:20:03,525
I went into my bedroom,

384
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,860
When I was a little boy,

385
00:20:04,894 --> 00:20:07,462
To get
my baseball glove,

386
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,131
And I found my mother

387
00:20:09,165 --> 00:20:11,900
Hanging by her neck
in the closet.

388
00:20:11,935 --> 00:20:14,036
Who would do that?

389
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:16,438
Who would
do that to her?

390
00:20:16,472 --> 00:20:17,906
You're gonna be fine.

391
00:20:20,376 --> 00:20:23,612
You're gonna be fine.

392
00:20:33,957 --> 00:20:37,926
Do you still feel like...

393
00:20:37,961 --> 00:20:40,929
You found your big love
when you died?

394
00:20:42,465 --> 00:20:44,166
In heaven?

395
00:20:48,504 --> 00:20:51,640
I thought I did,
but I don't know.

396
00:20:53,476 --> 00:20:55,577
Where's your bathroom?

397
00:20:55,612 --> 00:21:00,015
It's upstairs,
down the hall, on the left.

398
00:21:28,645 --> 00:21:31,747
Don't get any ideas.
I'm married.

399
00:21:31,781 --> 00:21:33,615
I'm sure your husband
would forgive

400
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,183
A heat-of-the-moment
mistake.

401
00:21:35,218 --> 00:21:37,185
In this world?

402
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:40,923
This is what
forgiveness looks like

403
00:21:40,957 --> 00:21:43,825
When you make a mistake.

404
00:21:45,962 --> 00:21:47,663
Who made you sad?

405
00:21:47,697 --> 00:21:48,931
I did.

406
00:21:48,965 --> 00:21:51,400
We're all okay.

407
00:21:51,434 --> 00:21:53,969
We're here.

408
00:21:54,003 --> 00:21:55,370
Ice cream?

409
00:23:21,124 --> 00:23:22,524
Whatcha doin'?

410
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:25,660
Nothing.
I got... I got lost.

411
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,396
You got lost?

412
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,964
I don't think
you got lost.

413
00:23:28,998 --> 00:23:30,465
I think
you're a snooper.

414
00:23:31,834 --> 00:23:35,070
I think you're
a snooper-snoopy-snoopalicious.

415
00:23:35,104 --> 00:23:36,338
You know, I don't really...

416
00:23:36,372 --> 00:23:38,373
I really don't feel
like cookies anymore.

417
00:23:38,408 --> 00:23:39,975
I'm just gonna go.

418
00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:41,810
You sure?

419
00:23:46,816 --> 00:23:48,583
No!

420
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:58,727
Back the fuck up!
Back the fuck up!

421
00:23:58,761 --> 00:24:00,362
Back the fuck up!

422
00:24:00,396 --> 00:24:02,097
Nice hat, Lily.
I do like an irish plaid.

423
00:24:02,131 --> 00:24:04,032
Step away from Miller
before you get blood on it.

424
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,033
Diego?

425
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,035
Put the gun down now!
Fuck you.

426
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,037
You bet. You lost.
I want my money.

427
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:11,206
Wait, you're alive?
How are you alive?

428
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,208
Magic of Miller. What's
going on? Am I dead?

429
00:24:13,242 --> 00:24:14,342
Are we all just dead?!

430
00:24:14,377 --> 00:24:16,044
Broken record,
this girl, right?

431
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,746
You're dead, I'm dead,
everybody's dead.

432
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,448
No, but I saw you
in the morgue.

433
00:24:19,482 --> 00:24:22,050
Wasn't me, babe.
Ask your cop boyfriend.

434
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:24,186
Oh, you can't do that.
He's not a real cop.

435
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,521
Kidder!
Miller?

436
00:24:26,556 --> 00:24:27,823
Be quiet!
Miller!

437
00:24:27,857 --> 00:24:29,558
Shut the fuck up!
Fuck this! I'm leaving!

438
00:24:29,592 --> 00:24:31,827
Don't fucking move! What
are you gonna do, shoot me?

439
00:24:31,861 --> 00:24:33,462
Yes, I will fucking
shoot you!

440
00:24:33,496 --> 00:24:34,629
Why would you do that?!

441
00:24:34,664 --> 00:24:37,732
Because your fucking father
murdered my mother!

442
00:24:39,569 --> 00:24:40,635
Lily?

443
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:43,038
Lily!

444
00:24:43,072 --> 00:24:44,806
Lily?

445
00:24:47,743 --> 00:24:50,846
You're wearing his
hat already, huh?

446
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,848
That was fast.

447
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,054
Robert, you should go.

448
00:24:59,088 --> 00:25:02,324
I wanted Carla
to tell my wife...

449
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:08,230
...My wife, who's dead...

450
00:25:08,264 --> 00:25:10,232
That I still love her.

451
00:25:10,266 --> 00:25:12,567
But I wanted it
to be a goodbye.

452
00:25:16,639 --> 00:25:19,841
I love you.

453
00:25:21,644 --> 00:25:23,278
I don't want to die anymore
to be with her.

454
00:25:23,312 --> 00:25:25,313
I want to live
to be with you.

455
00:25:32,421 --> 00:25:34,456
We would've never been right
for each other

456
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:35,957
Under
ordinary circumstances.

457
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:39,127
The only reason we even met
was because of this glitch...

458
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:41,396
This fucked-up thing
that we have in common.

459
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:43,431
But that's not a reason
to be together.

460
00:25:43,466 --> 00:25:45,500
We should be smart enough
to know

461
00:25:45,535 --> 00:25:48,170
Not to waste
any more time on this.

462
00:25:48,204 --> 00:25:49,571
It's dead.

463
00:25:49,605 --> 00:25:51,473
I don't love you.

464
00:25:55,444 --> 00:25:58,547
Goodbye, Lily Champagne.

465
00:26:06,923 --> 00:26:10,325
Wow. Rough crowd,
guttin' a man like that.

466
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:12,194
Remind me
not to get on your bad side.

467
00:26:12,228 --> 00:26:14,563
I want to know
what the hell is going on.

469
00:26:18,434 --> 00:26:19,768
You know what, Lily?
I take it back.

470
00:26:19,802 --> 00:26:21,436
Dumping him was
the right thing to do.

471
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,738
Suicide dummy,
you're a fucking idiot.

472
00:26:25,174 --> 00:26:28,310
Don't call me "suicide
dummy" anymore!

473
00:26:28,344 --> 00:26:29,311
No!

00:27:07,216 --> 00:27:13,788
* you helped me grow,
now you gotta let me go *

484
00:27:13,823 --> 00:27:19,094
* 'cause I have learned
to fly on my own *

485
00:27:19,128 --> 00:27:24,199
* and it's gonna be
pulling on my heart *
