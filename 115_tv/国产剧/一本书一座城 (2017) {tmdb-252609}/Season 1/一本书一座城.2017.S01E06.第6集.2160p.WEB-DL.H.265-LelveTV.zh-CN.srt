- I call bullshit. - Two beers?

137
00:07:13,214 --> 00:07:15,348
-你们的
- Here you go.

138
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,816
-谢谢你 -谢谢
- Thank you. - Thanks.

139
00:07:20,682 --> 00:07:24,433
可能我会 呃 调整文件
Maybe I would, uh, adjust the paperwork,

140
00:07:24,435 --> 00:07:27,073
然后让罗纳德里根号［一艘核动力舰艇］上的ATM机都
so all the ATMs on the U.S.S Ronald Reagan

141
00:07:27,075 --> 00:07:28,560
在他们部署三个月的时间里
would run out of cash

142
00:07:28,562 --> 00:07:30,763
都没现金可以取
about three months into their deployment.

143
00:07:30,765 --> 00:07:31,949
是吧
- Right?

144
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,364
我要藏起 我会藏起所有漏洞
I'd bury... I would bury all the shortcomings

145
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:36,268
然后让这看起来完全无踪可循
and I'd make it completely untraceable.

146
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:39,663
呃 但你不会惹祸上身吗
Ah. But wouldn't that get you in trouble?

147
00:07:39,665 --> 00:07:41,073
做好了就不会
Not if I did it right.

148
00:07:41,075 --> 00:07:43,109
有钱能使鬼推磨
Shit would roll uphill with that kind of money.

149
00:07:43,111 --> 00:07:46,814
你能让这么多钱消失吗
You could make that much money go missing?

150
00:07:46,816 --> 00:07:48,114
你在逗我吗
Are you kidding me?

151
00:07:48,116 --> 00:07:50,440
那种钱整天都在消失
That kind of money goes missing all the time.

152
00:07:50,442 --> 00:07:52,551
海军只是不想让任何人知道
The Navy just doesn't want anybody to know about it.

153
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:01,914
致幻剂
Lsd.

154
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,404
一定哪里出了错
There must've been some mistake.

155
00:08:03,406 --> 00:08:04,463
我是这么跟保释官说的
That's what I told my P.O.

156
00:08:04,465 --> 00:08:06,601
我这辈子都没嗑过那玩意
I've never taken that shit in my life.

157
00:08:06,603 --> 00:08:09,796
-你确定没有人搞小动作吗 -不 没问题
- Are you sure this wasn't a shakedown? - No, he's straight.

158
00:08:09,798 --> 00:08:11,932
"尿检不会说谎" 他是这么说的
"Piss test don't lie." That's what he said.

159
00:08:11,934 --> 00:08:13,172
好吧 这不是真的
Well, that's not true.

160
00:08:13,174 --> 00:08:14,704
他们整天把样本搞乱
They mix up those samples all the time.

161
00:08:14,706 --> 00:08:16,707
他们要我再测一次
They made me take a second test.

162
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:18,642
结果是阳性
- It's positive.

163
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:23,273
-是巴斯 他要见我们
- That's Baz. He wants to meet.

164
00:08:23,275 --> 00:08:24,717
-他一直在研究一个主意
-He's been working on an idea.

165
00:08:30,717 --> 00:08:32,334
你来吗
You comin'?

166
00:08:38,332 --> 00:08:41,000
那里原先有栋房子
Used to be a house down there.

167
00:08:41,394 --> 00:08:44,870
埃米利奥和卡门・欧提兹住的
Emilio and Carmen Ortiz.

168
00:08:45,045 --> 00:08:48,574
我在巡逻队时一起工作过
Used to work with me back when I was on patrol.

169
00:08:48,576 --> 00:08:50,242
条子吗
Cops?

170
00:08:50,244 --> 00:08:52,211
秘密线人
Confidential informants.

171
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,889
他们在沿海有过一系列抢劫
They had done a string of robberies along the coast

172
00:09:00,891 --> 00:09:02,521
后来想洗手不干
and wanted out.

173
00:09:02,895 --> 00:09:05,201
我觉得他们蹲点牢子就没事了
I think they would've been okay after they did a little time,

174
00:09:05,203 --> 00:09:06,406
-但是
- but...

175
00:09:06,408 --> 00:09:07,915
-他们犯了惹上
-...they made the mistake of getting into business

176
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:10,521
亚尼内・科迪的错
- with Janine Cody.

177
00:09:10,523 --> 00:09:12,798
-J的外婆
-J's grandmother.

178
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,214
她怀疑他们是线人
She suspected they were informants,

179
00:09:15,216 --> 00:09:17,816
派她儿子安德鲁烧了那房子
sent her son Andrew to burn the house down.

180
00:09:20,386 --> 00:09:22,237
他们在这找到了卡门
They found Carmen here.

181
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,091
她还算走运 在她的皮肤开始烧毁脱落前
She was lucky. She died of smoke inhalation

182
00:09:27,093 --> 00:09:29,482
死于吸入烟尘过多
before her skin started to burn off.

183
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,852
我们后来把牙齿送到实验室才能确认是她
Could only confirm it was her after we sent the teeth to the lab.

184
00:09:33,236 --> 00:09:37,147
而埃米利奥... 他肯定试着跑了
And Emilio... he must've tried to run.

185
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:39,352
在门边找到了他
Found him by the door.

186
00:09:39,354 --> 00:09:43,062
部分燃烧的屋顶掉下来 砸到他的躯干
Part of the burning ceiling fell, severed his torso.

187
00:09:43,064 --> 00:09:45,998
1997年 三月三号
March 3, 1997.

188
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,505
所以最后能给你提供关于科迪一家消息的人
So the last people to inform on the Codys for you

189
00:09:52,507 --> 00:09:55,141
被烧死了
burned to death.

190
00:09:55,143 --> 00:09:57,843
而你想让我叫J去做一样的事
And you want me to get J to do the same thing?

191
00:09:57,845 --> 00:10:01,480
他不是他们中的一份子 不完全是
He's not one of them. Not really.

192
00:10:01,482 --> 00:10:04,350
这就是他们怎么对局外人
And this is what they do to outsiders.

193
00:10:04,352 --> 00:10:08,053
唯一保护他的方法就是让他远离他们
Only way to protect him is to get him away from them.

194
00:10:08,055 --> 00:10:09,488
但要怎么做
But how?

195
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,590
继续你一直在做的事
Keep doing what you're doing.

196
00:10:17,797 --> 00:10:19,932
他亲了我
He kissed me.

197
00:10:21,468 --> 00:10:23,536
给他发信息
Text him.

198
00:10:23,538 --> 00:10:25,641
问他放学后要干嘛
See what he's doing after school.

199
00:10:26,973 --> 00:10:30,567
你是叫我睡一个17岁小孩儿吗
Are you asking me to sleep with a 17-year-old kid?

200
00:10:30,569 --> 00:10:33,345
当然不是 那会犯法的
Of course not. That would be illegal.

201
00:10:35,382 --> 00:10:39,214
但如果你在乎那孩子 在我们要验牙齿
But if you care about that kid, get him out,

202
00:10:39,216 --> 00:10:41,550
确认他身份前 救他出来
before we have to ID him by his teeth.

203
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,377
你 在对我保守秘密吗
You, uh, holding out on me?

204
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:54,783
我没有嗑药
I didn't do LSD.

205
00:10:54,785 --> 00:10:57,322
-嘿 你吃了个百吉饼吗 -什么
- Hey, you eat a bagel? - What?

206
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:58,515
-百吉饼 你有吃吗
- A bagel. Did you eat a bagel?

207
00:10:58,516 --> 00:10:59,976
-你他妈在说什么啊
- What the hell are you talking about?

208
00:10:59,978 --> 00:11:01,933
罂粟种子 老兄 你的尿里有那玩意儿
The poppy seeds, man. That shit is in your piss.

209
00:11:01,935 --> 00:11:04,106
-每个人都知道 -别这样
- Everybody knows that. - Come on.

210
00:11:04,108 --> 00:11:05,554
那是鸦片 蠢货
That's opium, dipshit.

211
00:11:05,556 --> 00:11:06,547
噢对 那可能是别的什么
Yeah, well, maybe something else.

212
00:11:06,549 --> 00:11:08,599
可能不是鸦片 但 你懂的
Maybe not the poppies, but, you know,

213
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:11,556
差不多的东西 我就说说
something like that. Just sayin'.

214
00:11:11,558 --> 00:11:12,991
为了你的健康
To your health.

215
00:11:14,962 --> 00:11:16,561
嘿
Hey.

216
00:11:16,563 --> 00:11:18,630
蒲伯在监狱呆了一晚上
Pope spent the night in jail.

217
00:11:18,632 --> 00:11:20,365
是 我听说了
Yeah, I heard.

218
00:11:20,367 --> 00:11:22,988
一晚上还不够把牙刷做成小刀呢
Not even long enough to make a toothbrush into a shiv.

219
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:26,267
好了 开始吧 -我觉得我有些
Okay, let's get started. - I think I have something.

220
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,974
大料
Could be big.

221
00:11:28,976 --> 00:11:31,636
彭德顿营地
Camp Pendleton.

222
00:11:31,638 --> 00:11:33,880
-哇哦 这怎么了 -我们要突袭那
- Wow, what about it? - We're gonna hit it.

223
00:11:33,882 --> 00:11:35,839
这是个军事基地
That's a military base.

224
00:11:35,841 --> 00:11:37,593
听起来不错 我干
Sounds awesome. I'm in.

225
00:11:37,595 --> 00:11:40,340
耶 我们要去干嘛 核弹头还是坦克
Yeah, what are we going for? A nuclear warhead or a tank?

226
00:11:40,342 --> 00:11:43,556
那基地里有一大笔钱 一大笔
There is a ton of cash on that base. A ton.

227
00:11:43,558 --> 00:11:47,546
被配狙击来福枪的士兵和攻击直升机围着
Surrounded by soldiers with sniper rifles and attack helicopters.

228
00:11:47,548 --> 00:11:50,006
但如果他们不知道我们要去偷 那些全都没用
Yeah, all useless if they don't know we're taking it.

229
00:11:50,008 --> 00:11:51,262
怎么搞
How?

230
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:52,887
还在想呢
Still working on that part.

231
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:54,959
噢 听起来万无一失啊
Well, sounds like a foolproof plan.

232
00:11:54,961 --> 00:11:56,362
听着 这需要点时间
Look, it's gonna take some time,

233
00:11:56,364 --> 00:11:57,902
但我的线人知道怎么出入那个基地
but my mark knows the ins and outs of the base.

234
00:11:57,904 --> 00:12:00,295
-等等 你的线人 -对啊 保罗
- Wait, your mark? - Yeah. Paul.

235
00:12:00,297 --> 00:12:01,671
尼基她爸
Nicky's dad.

236
00:12:01,673 --> 00:12:03,998
尼基 J的女朋友尼基
Nicky? J's girlfriend Nicky?

237
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,295
对啊 他管着长期部署的航空母舰上的经费
Yeah. He handles serious money for long deployments,

238
00:12:06,297 --> 00:12:09,695
我在努力动员他
aircraft carriers, all that. I've been workin' him hard.

239
00:12:09,697 --> 00:12:12,583
等等 我们什么时候开始和
Hold on. Since when do we do jobs with people

240
00:12:12,585 --> 00:12:15,351
外面的人一起干活了
outside of the family?

241
00:12:15,353 --> 00:12:17,904
这个叫保罗的家伙 听起来像个孬种
This Paul guy... he sounds like a pussy.

242
00:12:17,906 --> 00:12:20,843
还有 条子一察觉到他的踪迹
And the... the second the cops breathe in his direction,

243
00:12:20,845 --> 00:12:22,394
他就会指向我们
he's going to point them right to us.

244
00:12:22,396 --> 00:12:24,418
蒲伯 我能应付他
Pope, I can handle him.

245
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,768
我觉得他准备好要越界了 他想要着呢
I got a feeling he's ready to cross a line. He wants it.

246
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,523
-他只需要有人推他一把 我跟你说 -不要
- He just needs a push. I'm telling you... - No.

247
00:12:28,525 --> 00:12:31,569
不 不 不
No! No! No.

248
00:12:31,932 --> 00:12:35,087
我们联合起来 带枪进去
We case a joint, we go in with guns,

249
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:36,701
带钱出来
we come out with cash.

250
00:12:36,703 --> 00:12:38,002
没那么复杂
It's not that complicated.

251
00:12:38,004 --> 00:12:41,822
就像抢富国银行那次吗 简单到你进了监狱
Like the Wells Fargo job? So easy it landed you in prison.

252
00:12:41,824 --> 00:12:44,215
对 为了救你
Yeah. Saving your ass.

253
00:12:48,155 --> 00:12:50,188
你也要干这狗屁事吗
Are you on board with this crap?

254
00:12:54,216 --> 00:12:56,418
看看这计划有没有可行性
Let's see if the plan has legs.

255
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:09,425
你们要做好各自的部分
Gonna need you guys to do your part.

256
00:13:09,427 --> 00:13:11,376
我行程表上周四还空着 所以
Yeah, I got an opening in my schedule on Thursday, so...

257
00:13:11,378 --> 00:13:13,111
就得是今晚
It's gotta be tonight.

258
00:13:13,441 --> 00:13:15,780
-莲要办个派对 -看来 你得错过了呗
- Renn's throwing a party. - Well, you're missing it.

259
00:13:16,702 --> 00:13:19,096
我很快就会告诉你细节
I'll give you the details in a minute.

260
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,378
你是叫我们走吗
Is that your way of telling us to leave?

261
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,888
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

262
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:32,803
蒲伯有什么的嫌疑 嗑药
Pope suspect anything? Meds?

263
00:13:32,805 --> 00:13:34,302
我不知道
I don't know.

264
00:13:34,304 --> 00:13:35,779
那J呢
What about J?

265
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:37,089
J什么
What about J?

266
00:13:37,091 --> 00:13:39,724
他可能对利用尼基她爸有意见
He might have an opinion on using Nicky's dad.

267
00:13:39,726 --> 00:13:42,186
我想让J知道的时候他会知道的
J will find out when I want him to.

268
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,097
好 我们达成一致了
Good. We agree.

269
00:13:44,099 --> 00:13:47,712
不 我们没有
No, we don't agree.

270
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:50,512
你说的是军事基地啊
You're talking about a military base.

271
00:13:52,017 --> 00:13:53,610
你也是吧 哈
You, too, huh?

272
00:13:53,612 --> 00:13:55,939
目标越大 风险越大
The bigger the score, the bigger the risk.

273
00:13:55,941 --> 00:13:57,813
按我说的做就不会了
But not if we do it my way.

274
00:14:59,102 --> 00:15:01,520
哇 你是我手下败将
Whoo! I'm making you my bitch.

275
00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:06,320
是啊 可巴斯让我们俩做他的手下
Yeah, Baz is making us both his bitches.

276
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,828
如果他的想法能行 至少我们会大赚一把
Well, if his idea works, at least we'll be rolling in it.

277
00:15:10,214 --> 00:15:11,626
就算我们可以抢诺克斯堡［美国肯塔基州军事基地］
You know, we could rob Fort Knox,

278
00:15:11,628 --> 00:15:13,983
小精灵还是会限制我们零用
and Smurf would still have us on allowance.

279
00:15:13,985 --> 00:15:15,444
这他妈太扯淡了
This is bullshit.

280
00:15:15,446 --> 00:15:17,635
我现在本来可以在个嗨趴上
I could be at a killer party right now.

281
00:15:17,637 --> 00:15:18,929
是啊 抢个房子也很酷
Yeah, and robbing a house would be rad

282
00:15:18,931 --> 00:15:21,673
-如果巴斯不让我们做所有的事 -嗯哼
- if Baz doesn't make us do all the work. - Mm-hmm.

283
00:15:24,394 --> 00:15:26,194
怎么了
What's up?

284
00:15:26,196 --> 00:15:28,524
在等小精灵
Just waiting for Smurf.

285
00:15:28,526 --> 00:15:29,999
什么 你要去教堂啊
What, are you going to church?

286
00:15:30,001 --> 00:15:32,274
没 我要和尼基家里人共进晚餐
No. I'm going to dinner with Nicky's family.

287
00:15:32,276 --> 00:15:36,321
如果是她爸付钱 叫只龙虾
Well, if her dad's paying, get the lobster.

288
00:15:38,006 --> 00:15:40,792
你们不是该上路了吗
Shouldn't you boys be getting a move on?

289
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,561
是啊 这局玩好后
Yeah, after this game.

290
00:15:43,739 --> 00:15:46,598
J 能请你去车上等我吗 谢谢
J, can you wait for me in the car, please?

291
00:15:53,417 --> 00:15:58,343
我想你现在就去 并且集中精力
I want you to go now and focus.

292
00:15:58,512 --> 00:15:59,707
听着 如果你觉得我们没能力做这个
Look, if you don't think we're capable

293
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,640
你可以去找别人
of doing this job, you can go find someone else to do it.

294
00:16:02,642 --> 00:16:04,860
宝贝儿 我永远不会强制你做任何
Baby, I would never ask you to do anything

295
00:16:04,862 --> 00:16:08,196
-你不想做的事 -很好
- you feel uncomfortable with. - Good.

296
00:16:08,198 --> 00:16:09,690
那去告诉巴斯我们
- Then tell Baz we're taking

297
00:16:09,692 --> 00:16:11,850
-今晚不干他的破事儿了
-the night off from his bullshit.

298
00:16:11,852 --> 00:16:13,385
去啊
Go.

299
00:16:17,324 --> 00:16:19,342
你真的这么想
You really feel that way?

300
00:16:19,344 --> 00:16:21,110
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

301
00:16:24,344 --> 00:16:26,012
德兰
Deran?

302
00:16:26,014 --> 00:16:27,814
告诉她 老兄
Tell her, man.

303
00:16:32,841 --> 00:16:34,689
孬种
Pussy!

304
00:16:37,688 --> 00:16:40,718
我觉得蒲伯会很高兴替上你
I think Pope will be happy to fill in for you.

305
00:16:42,288 --> 00:16:44,318
我会记得谁想在我分赃的时候
And I'll remember who pulled their weight

306
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,554
滥竽充数
when I divvy up the take.

307
00:16:51,597 --> 00:16:53,431
凯瑟
- Cath?

308
00:16:56,325 --> 00:16:57,837
凯瑟
Cath.

309
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:00,751
嘿
Hey.

310
00:17:02,382 --> 00:17:04,842
我们等过你 但是莉娜累了
We waited for you, but Lena was tired.

311
00:17:04,844 --> 00:17:07,512
我在小精灵那耽误了
Yeah, I got held up at Smurf's.

312
00:17:07,581 --> 00:17:09,347
我打过电话
I called.

313
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:11,549
德兰说你几小时前就走了
Deran said you left hours ago.

314
00:17:15,415 --> 00:17:18,022
你觉得我喜欢这样吗
You think I like this?

315
00:17:18,172 --> 00:17:21,056
做唠叨的妻子 老问你去了哪儿
The nagging wife, always asking where you've been.

316
00:17:21,058 --> 00:17:22,627
你还满擅长的啊
Well, you're getting good at it.

317
00:17:24,947 --> 00:17:28,379
你知道 酒吧里整天有人来勾搭我
You know, guys come into the bar and hit on me all the time.

318
00:17:31,435 --> 00:17:34,605
我没有出轨 凯瑟 好吗
I'm not cheating on you, Cath. Okay?

319
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,710
曾经那很烦人
Used to be a pain in the ass,

320
00:17:38,818 --> 00:17:41,888
试着礼貌地拒绝他们又不会失去小费
trying to let them down gently without losing tips.

321
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:45,483
现在我倒是期待
Now I look forward to it,

322
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,819
有人想跟我说话
someone wanting to talk to me.

323
00:17:48,689 --> 00:17:50,388
我当时在我爸家
I was at my dad's.

324
00:17:51,115 --> 00:17:53,324
他住在维斯塔那儿一辆房车里
He lives in a trailer over in Vista.

325
00:17:55,194 --> 00:17:57,462
我以为他被判了无期徒刑
I thought he was in for life.

326
00:17:57,862 --> 00:18:00,965
我猜州里觉得26年够了
I guess the state thought 26 years was enough.

327
00:18:01,153 --> 00:18:02,667
你原意跟他说话了吗
You're talking to him?

328
00:18:02,801 --> 00:18:04,634
在他对你做了那些事之后
After everything he did to you...

329
00:18:09,668 --> 00:18:11,175
如果父母还活着
You telling me you wouldn't talk to your parents

330
00:18:11,255 --> 00:18:13,122
你告诉我你不愿意跟他们说话吗
if they were still alive?

331
00:18:16,482 --> 00:18:18,216
小精灵知道吗
Does Smurf know?

332
00:18:20,801 --> 00:18:23,955
不 不 小精灵不知道
No. No, Smurf does not know.

333
00:18:25,383 --> 00:18:29,127
这不重要 他离开了
Doesn't matter anyway. He's gone.

334
00:18:29,129 --> 00:18:30,387
去哪
Where?

335
00:18:30,389 --> 00:18:33,757
谁知道 反正走了
Who knows? But he's gone.

336
00:18:37,243 --> 00:18:38,836
那你干嘛去那儿
Then why'd you go there?

337
00:18:39,697 --> 00:18:41,562
去喂他的猫
Feed his cat.

338
00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:49,733
你 你去喂他的猫
You... You went to feed his cat?

339
00:18:49,735 --> 00:18:52,984
是啊
I did. Yes.

340
00:19:07,534 --> 00:19:10,168
-祝您健康 -祝您健康
- Salud. - Salud.

341
00:19:13,373 --> 00:19:16,908
我不知道夫勒诺斯的货这么棒
I had no idea the shit in Fresno was this good.

342
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,407
你该让你的表兄多来做客
You should have your cousins come down more often.

343
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,167
你还要来一排吗
You ready for another line?

344
00:19:23,169 --> 00:19:25,704
我反正不用再去哪
I don't have to be anywhere.

345
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:26,580
你知道的 如果你告诉我
You know, if you'd told me

346
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,395
你关店以后是做这些
this is what you do after you close...

347
00:19:29,397 --> 00:19:31,405
-我每个晚上都会来
- I would've been here every night.

348
00:19:31,407 --> 00:19:33,958
斯考特管着这里
- Scottie manages the place.

349
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:37,728
恩
Mm.

350
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,464
哇哈
Whoa! Whoo!

351
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:42,133
哇
- Whoo!

352
00:19:43,937 --> 00:19:47,472
现在我要你让我尖叫
Now I want you to make me scream.

353
00:19:47,614 --> 00:19:48,980
恩
Hmm.

354
00:19:59,752 --> 00:20:01,018
好吧
All right.

355
00:20:04,924 --> 00:20:07,158
我不想呆在家
#I don't like staying at home #

356
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,460
当月亮猩红
#When the moon is bleeding red #

357
00:20:09,462 --> 00:20:12,079
醉醺醺在后座从梦中醒来
#Woke up stoned in the backseat from a dream #

358
00:20:12,081 --> 00:20:14,429
梦里我的牙齿从头上脱落
#Where my teeth fell out of my head #

359
00:20:14,431 --> 00:20:16,535
你想放手吗
#Do you feel like letting go? #

360
00:20:16,537 --> 00:20:19,070
过来
Now come here.

361
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:24,942
我不知道有多远
#I wonder how far down it is #

362
00:20:26,368 --> 00:20:28,513
一切都无趣
#Nothing is fun #

363
00:20:28,515 --> 00:20:31,215
不像从前
#Not like before #

364
00:20:31,217 --> 00:20:34,819
你再也无法使我兴奋
#You don't get me high anymore #

365
00:20:36,122 --> 00:20:38,623
曾经只用一片
#Used to take one #

366
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,791
现在要四片
#Now it takes four #

367
00:20:40,793 --> 00:20:45,796
你再也无法使我兴奋
#You don't get me high anymore #

368
00:20:48,446 --> 00:20:51,549
再也无法使我兴奋
#You don't get me high anymore #

369
00:20:54,902 --> 00:20:57,271
不敢相信小精灵让我做这破事
Can't believe Smurf has me doing this shit.

370
00:20:57,273 --> 00:20:58,902
不是小精灵 是巴斯
It's not Smurf. It's Baz.

371
00:20:58,904 --> 00:21:02,698
我从青春期开始就没抢过房子了
I haven't hit a house since, like, puberty.

372
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,025
上帝啊 老兄 你以前抱怨活太难做
Jeez, man, you were bitching about the job being too hard.

373
00:21:05,027 --> 00:21:07,521
现在你又抱怨活儿太简单
Now you're bitching about it being too easy.

374
00:21:07,628 --> 00:21:09,970
-你到底在这干嘛 -你想一个人做吗
- Why you even here? - Do you wanna do it alone?

375
00:21:09,972 --> 00:21:12,945
-你呢 -放轻松 老兄 别
- Do you? - Relax, man. No.

376
00:21:12,947 --> 00:21:15,372
呆在牢子里一晚上 你就心情不好了
One night in jail and you're in a shitty mood.

377
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:18,932
今晚有事要发生
Something happens tonight...

378
00:21:19,167 --> 00:21:22,769
我要闪亮登场 你懂我的意思吗
I'm coming out firing. Do you understand me?

379
00:21:22,954 --> 00:21:26,608
他们得杀了我 因为老子才不要回去里边儿
They're gonna have to kill me 'cause I'm not going back inside.

380
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:30,010
老天 你在里面经历了什么
Jesus, man, what happened to you in there?

381
00:21:48,296 --> 00:21:50,597
在这儿 磁铁
- Bingo. Magnet.

382
00:22:00,643 --> 00:22:02,009
好吧 拿电视
All right, TV.

383
00:22:16,658 --> 00:22:19,192
你说
What do you say

384
00:22:19,194 --> 00:22:22,369
我们去吸点然后再战怎么样
we do some more blow and go again?

385
00:22:22,371 --> 00:22:24,891
-恩 -听上去不错
- Hmm? - Tempting.

386
00:22:24,893 --> 00:22:27,100
但是我必须要走了
But I gotta go.

387
00:22:27,481 --> 00:22:29,536
我不想看到这个
I don't wanna see this.

388
00:22:29,538 --> 00:22:34,976
看到什么
See what?

389
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:37,732
我被抢的那天 塞奇在波特兰
Sage was in Portland the day I got robbed.

390
00:22:37,734 --> 00:22:40,665
他给我看了机票和所有东西
Showed me a plane ticket and everything.

391
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:42,649
这是个单纯的误会
It's an easy mistake.

392
00:22:42,898 --> 00:22:44,662
你不必感到难过 我们会找到那个真正的抢劫的人
You don't have to feel bad. We'll find the right guy.

393
00:22:44,664 --> 00:22:46,773
你有我的项链
You had my necklace...

394
00:22:47,819 --> 00:22:51,058
那条你说你从他那里拿回来的项链
the one you said you got from him.

395
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:54,494
你看着我去死  克雷格
You left me to die, Craig.

396
00:22:54,496 --> 00:22:56,963
我现在要做同样的事情
Now I'm gonna do the same.

397
00:22:56,965 --> 00:22:59,199
啊
Aah!

398
00:23:02,738 --> 00:23:04,304
把这个人渣绑起来
Tie this piece of shit.

399
00:23:04,306 --> 00:23:06,406
－抓住他了吗 -我按住他了 按住他了
- Got it? - I got it, got it.

400
00:23:08,711 --> 00:23:13,013
继续
- Come on.

401
00:23:17,585 --> 00:23:19,886
继续 把他绑好
Come on. Let's get him up.

402
00:23:28,831 --> 00:23:31,798
嗯啊
Uhh!

403
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,974
我在卧室找到了一些珠宝 但是都是次品
I got the jewelry from the bedroom, but it's crap.

404
00:23:33,976 --> 00:23:35,890
连我们买汽油的钱都不够
It won't even cover the cost of gas.

405
00:23:35,892 --> 00:23:38,560
当然啦 谁关心那个 我找到一个公文包
Yeah, who gives a shit? I got the briefcase.

406
00:23:38,562 --> 00:23:39,775
里面有啥
What's in it?

407
00:23:39,777 --> 00:23:41,826
我不知道啊 文件和一些东西
I don't know. Papers and stuff.

408
00:23:41,828 --> 00:23:44,042
文件 巴斯让我们闯进来就是为了一些文件
Papers? Baz has us breaking in for papers?

409
00:23:44,044 --> 00:23:45,548
对啊

你在干什么 不要把我的自行车给他
What are you doing? Don't give him my bike.

你有抢劫妮基的家吗
did you rob Nicky's house?

507
00:30:46,241 --> 00:30:49,809
我听到你跟克雷格有说到这个 那是妮基的吗
I heard you and Craig talking about it. Was it Nicky's?

508
00:30:49,811 --> 00:30:52,487
所以如果是的话怎么样
So what if it was?

509
00:30:54,448 --> 00:30:56,902
你可以抢劫任何人 舅舅
You could've robbed anybody, man.

510
00:30:56,904 --> 00:31:00,820
听着 兄弟 我只是随便说说 好吗
Look, man, I'm just the grunt, okay?

511
00:31:00,822 --> 00:31:04,724
你去问巴斯 他是这个计划的大老板
Talk to Baz. He's the big man with the plan.

512
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:10,624
他不会这么对他们的
He's not done with them.

513
00:31:24,846 --> 00:31:27,113
先是蒲伯 现在是你
First Pope, now you?

514
00:31:27,115 --> 00:31:30,149
你知道我还曾希望有一天你们这些孩子可以知道
You know I had hoped that someday you boys would know

515
00:31:30,151 --> 00:31:32,118
怎么照顾你们自己
how to take care of yourselves.

516
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,120
你从来都不站在我的立场上
You haven't even heard my side.

517
00:31:34,122 --> 00:31:37,390
我知道你的立场 亲爱的 发自内心地知道
I know your side, Sweetie, by heart.

518
00:31:40,727 --> 00:31:46,065
我鼓励你野性一点  但是要有限度
I encouraged you to be wild, but there's a line.

519
00:31:47,901 --> 00:31:50,503
你期望什么
What do you expect?

520
00:31:50,505 --> 00:31:53,973
你给我的都是些烂工作
All you give me are the shit jobs.

521
00:31:53,975 --> 00:31:55,474
这不是真的
That's not true.

522
00:31:55,476 --> 00:31:58,444
你认为我很傻是吗
You think I'm stupid?

523
00:31:58,446 --> 00:32:01,514
你都没有试着隐藏一下
You don't even try to hide it.

524
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:05,518
我不认为你很蠢
I don't think you're stupid.

525
00:32:07,554 --> 00:32:10,089
我认为你有真正的天赋
I think you've got real gifts.

526
00:32:10,091 --> 00:32:13,059
是吗 是什么
Yeah? What?

527
00:32:14,761 --> 00:32:17,430
你无所畏惧
You're fearless.

528
00:32:17,432 --> 00:32:21,300
因此你可以做到你兄弟们做不到的事情
You've got what it takes to do things your brothers won't.

529
00:32:21,302 --> 00:32:23,169
他们做不到
They can't.

530
00:32:23,171 --> 00:32:26,505
但是下次像这样的事情发生的时候
But the next time something like this happens,

531
00:32:26,507 --> 00:32:30,376
你不要打电话找我
don't you call me,

532
00:32:30,378 --> 00:32:32,712
因为我不会来的
because I will not come.

533
00:33:17,991 --> 00:33:21,093
想喝一些药水吗
Want some syrup?

534
00:33:21,095 --> 00:33:24,263
给你 只能喝一点点
Here we go. Just a little bit.

535
00:33:24,265 --> 00:33:26,799
正好吗 还是多一些
Good? More?

536
00:33:28,902 --> 00:33:30,676
多一些 哦 我的天
More? Oh, my God.

537
00:33:30,678 --> 00:33:32,805
你会蹦到墙上去的 丫头
You're gonna be bouncing off the walls, kiddo.

538
00:33:32,807 --> 00:33:34,473
呀
Yikes.

539
00:33:36,643 --> 00:33:38,878
-我们应该经常这么做 -对啊
- We should do this more often. - Yeah.

540
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,201
每天都要一份煎饼 记得吗
Pancakes every day. Remember?

541
00:33:42,203 --> 00:33:43,949
我当然记得
I do remember.

542
00:33:43,951 --> 00:33:47,553
我们是小孩子的时候定下来的
We were kids when we agreed to that.

543
00:33:47,555 --> 00:33:50,656
约定就是约定
- A deal's a deal.

544
00:33:50,658 --> 00:33:52,966
那是我们觉得唯一会像真正的父母做的事情
That's only 'cause we thought that's what real parents did.

545
00:33:52,968 --> 00:33:54,293
什么是真正的父母
What's real parents?

546
00:33:54,295 --> 00:33:56,422
一些我跟她之间肯定没有的东西

这些对你来说太普通了吗
Things get a little too normal for you?

00:37:09,366 --> 00:37:12,224
照你的描述看 我还以为会很嗨
By the way you made it sound, I thought you'd still be high.

-这你敢信 -不敢
- Can you believe it? - I can't.

620

条子说是一群外行干的
Cops said that a bunch of amateurs did this.

621
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:54,465
-是啊 -他们还是查不到啥

嗯 这太糟糕了

624
00:38:58,538 --> 00:39:01,218
只是一些东西 对吗 都可以买新的
It's just stuff, though, right? It's replaceable.

625
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:06,044
他们拿了我的公文包
They took my briefcase.

626
00:39:06,046 --> 00:39:07,991
-为什么 -那上了锁
- Why? - It was locked.

627
00:39:07,993 --> 00:39:10,715
他们大概觉得里面有值钱的东西
They probably thought there was something valuable inside?

628
00:39:10,717 --> 00:39:11,926
我 我 我不知道
I-I-I don't know.

629

但只是工作上的东西 对吗 我说...
But it's just work stuff, right? I mean...

630
00:39:14,954 --> 00:39:17,522
有什么问题吗
What's the problem?

631

里面有些机密文件
Some of those files are classified.

632
00:39:19,726 --> 00:39:21,402
好吧 它们本来不该拿出基地的
Okay, they're not supposed to be off the base.

633
00:39:21,404 --> 00:39:24,180
我是说 我时不时带它们回家是因为
I mean, I bring them home sometimes because

634
00:39:24,182 --> 00:39:26,280
我不想一辈子呆在该死的办公室
I'd spend the rest of my life in that freaking office.

635

-我懂 我明白了

-他们会在军事法庭审判我 -噢 该死

你有多想要回这些文件
How bad do you want those files back?

640
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,187
这是什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

641
00:39:49,189 --> 00:39:51,537
嗯 我们管着一堆低收入资产
Well, we handle a bunch of low income properties,

642
00:39:51,539 --> 00:39:53,371
还跟很多坏家伙打交道
and we deal with some pretty shady characters.

643
00:39:53,373 --> 00:39:56,694
如果我们想解决问题
If we want a problem fixed...

644
00:39:56,696 --> 00:39:59,030
就打电话叫人
we call some guys.

那种可以到处问的人
The kind of guys that can ask around.

647
00:40:02,763 --> 00:40:05,920
他们可以查出哪组人下的手
They can find out which crew did your house.

648
00:40:05,922 --> 00:40:07,923
也许能把你的箱子拿回来
Maybe get your briefcase back.

649
00:40:07,925 --> 00:40:09,407
他们要怎么做到啊
How are they gonna do that?

650
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:12,610
别问问题比较好
It's better not to ask questions.

651
00:40:17,325 --> 00:40:18,497
算了 我就不该提
Forget it. I shouldn't have brought it up.

我只是在和你爸喝酒
I was just having a drink with your dad.

657
00:40:37,062 --> 00:40:40,471
别让J知道我看到你了 他可能也会对你发脾气
Don't tell J I saw you. He might go off on you, too.

658
00:40:40,473 --> 00:40:41,669
这话什么意思
What does that mean?

659
00:40:41,671 --> 00:40:43,638
他是个狗屎的意思
He's a shit is what it means.

660

他刚和我分手
He just broke up with me.

661

-为什么 -我怎么知道
- Why? - Like I know?

662
00:40:52,652 --> 00:40:54,074
一切都正常 然后突然
Everything was cool, and then out of nowhere,

663
00:40:54,106 --> 00:40:56,885
他就翻脸不想跟我在一起了
he just flips out and wants nothing to do with me.

664
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:00,053
我就该给他一拳
I should've punched him.

665
00:41:02,222 --> 00:41:04,162
要我说 他犯了个大错
Well, he made a big mistake.

666
00:41:25,556 --> 00:41:27,327
-嘿 巴斯 -嘿 老兄 你有空吗

672
00:41:51,211 --> 00:41:53,578
你有看见那个金刚石刀片吗
Have you seen the diamond blade?

673
00:41:57,716 --> 00:42:01,786
我一直往你食物里放这些
I've been putting these in your food

674
00:42:01,788 --> 00:42:05,990
因为你有需要而且从来不听我说
because you need them and you never would've listened to me,

675
00:42:05,992 --> 00:42:09,393
在那个状态你就不会听
not in the state you were in.

676
00:42:09,395 --> 00:42:12,630

You know you could've gotten me sent back to prison.

679

你下一次尿检之前
Before your next piss test,

你去告诉你的假释官你又有服药了
you tell your parole officer you're back on your meds.

681
00:42:25,163 --> 00:42:27,420
你凭什么觉得我会吃药
And what makes you think I'm gonna keep taking 'em?

682
00:42:27,422 --> 00:42:30,815
因为你知道你要吃
Because you know you need them.

683
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:44,395
只有我吃药了你才会喜欢我吗
You don't like me unless I'm on these pills?

684
00:42:44,397 --> 00:42:47,231
是这样吗
Is that it?

685
00:42:50,602 --> 00:42:53,371
-或者我就该冲走它们
- Or I could just flush 'em.

686
00:42:53,373 --> 00:42:56,574
可以吃了也可以冲了
Could take 'em or flush 'em.

687

这么多选择
So many choices.

688
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:25,836

00:43:29,909 --> 00:43:32,677
噢 对 小精灵跟你说的吗
Oh, yeah. Did Smurf tell you?

692
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:36,980
嗯哼 我以为你俩很好啊
Mm-hmm. I thought things were good.

693
00:43:36,982 --> 00:43:39,057
我这么以为 老兄
Me, too, man.

694
00:43:39,059 --> 00:43:41,986
对她来说不好吧 我猜
Not for her, I guess.

695
00:43:41,988 --> 00:43:44,088
所以她甩了你
So she dumped you?

696
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:45,523
是啊
Yeah.

697
00:43:45,525 --> 00:43:47,825
我都不知道她要甩我 老兄
I had no idea it was coming, man.

698
00:43:49,795 --> 00:43:52,797
是啊 女人不是总能搞懂的
Yeah, women don't always make sense.

699
00:43:54,366 --> 00:43:56,752
一切都
Thing is...

700
00:43:56,754 --> 00:43:58,620
尼基跟我说你甩了她
Nicky told me you dumped her.

701
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:03,641
到底哪个是真的 J
So which is it, J?

702
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:08,045
你别跟我扯淡 我也不跟你扯淡怎么样
How 'bout you don't bullshit me, I don't bullshit you?

703
00:44:08,047 --> 00:44:10,781
你知道最近发生什么了
You figured out what's been going on?

704

Yeah, enough.

705
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:15,386
你觉得你在保护她吗
And you think you're protecting her?

706
00:44:15,388 --> 00:44:17,555
-你在利用她 对吗 -是

还有她爸
And her dad.

708
00:44:18,825 --> 00:44:19,955
我想到现在为止 你差不多该知道了
I thought you'd know this by now.

709
00:44:20,014 --> 00:44:23,251
所有家庭之外的人就是个旗子 每个都是
Everyone outside the family is a mark. Everyone.

710
00:44:23,253 --> 00:44:24,829
我是个棋子吗
Am I a mark?

711
00:44:26,766 --> 00:44:28,555
听着 你反应过激了 没事的
Look, you overreacted. It's fine.

712
00:44:28,557 --> 00:44:29,837
你还没造成永久的伤害
You didn't do any permanent damage.

713
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:33,135
但这事是要干的 是吗
But this thing is happening, okay?

714
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:35,906
你来不来 都要干
With or without you, this is happening.

715
00:44:35,908 --> 00:44:37,875
别把尼基一家拉进来
Just leave Nicky and her family alone.

716
00:44:37,877 --> 00:44:40,349
现在轮到你下命令了吗 你以为事是这么办的吗
Are you making demands now? You think that's how this works?

717
00:44:40,351 --> 00:44:42,803
我们现在只是在谈话 你就很走运了
You're lucky you and I are just talking right now.

You're lucky.

719
00:44:47,919 --> 00:44:51,555
家庭第一 所有别的都是其次
Family comes first. Everything else is second.

720
00:44:51,557 --> 00:44:53,257

You understand me?

721

726

在宾馆房间 希望是这样
In his hotel room, I hope.

731

我们可能又有个麻烦了
We may have another problem.

732
00:45:54,053 --> 00:45:55,920
尼基的爸爸吗
Nicky's dad?
