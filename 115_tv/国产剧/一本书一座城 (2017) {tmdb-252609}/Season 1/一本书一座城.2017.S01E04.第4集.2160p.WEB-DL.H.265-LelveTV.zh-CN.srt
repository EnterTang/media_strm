1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,880
Glasgow's my home. I want to stay.
You're staying?
格拉斯哥我的家。我想留下来。
你要留下来？

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,120
It just feels like Frankie's
needling her way into my life.

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,520
This is Frankie. Frankie's doing
the photos for our new brochure.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,440
I thought this might be one for Jay
to take charge of actually. Jay?

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,520
Easier to be the scarlet woman than
come out of the closet, I suppose.

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,960
I do love him. We don't want
to cause a scene, do we?

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,320
I think you've managed that
already, sweetheart. Aaargh!

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,840
I'm now dumped and homeless.
I can help you find somewhere.

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,880
You're moving in with Frankie? Yeah.

10
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,360
Who's that then?
That's Hayley, the fit intern.

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,560
She's been flirting
with me non-stop.

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,880
Hayley... Hayley.

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,240
It's ketamine.

14
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:47,120
The album she made of you
as a kid, it's gone.

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,000
Who the hell would want my photos?
Something was sent here.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,760
A photo album? Sent to someone
called Annie Cawthorne.

17
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,440
We have got copies of most
of the documents you requested.

18
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,680
Your parents' death certificates
along with your sister's.

19
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,040
Little Francesca.
Tragic losing someone so young.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,720
This programme contains strong
language and scenes of a sexual
nature.

21
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,840
Is that all you've got?
Yep. All my worldly goods.

22
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,320
Yeah, I'm the same.
Just got a few bits.

23
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,400
What?

24
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,000
Tess, what is all this?

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,560
It's my life. Is that everything?

26
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,680
Absolutely everything.

27
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,880
Oh, shit. I left my sponge bag
in the bathroom.

28
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,400
I'll get it. Thank you.

29
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh, and there's a book on
that weird shelf thing. All right.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,040
And a jumper on the clothes horse
by my room.

31
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,400
And the mascara.

32
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,720
Oh, shit! Sorry. It's all right.

33
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,520
I'm just looking for Tess's bag.
It's OK.

34
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,840
No. Um...

35
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,520
I'm Sam.

36
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,400
Yeah.

37
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,600
And you must be...Frankie?

38
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,360
Yeah, Cat's told me all about you.
It's nice to finally meet you.

39
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,520
Yeah.

40
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,040
Yeah.

41
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,400
What the hell are you doing?

42
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,760
Sorry, I was just...
And your door was...?

43
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,840
What? Open?

44
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,280
Sorry. Frankie...

45
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,280
I don't want to fight all the time.
It's boring.

46
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,160
Yeah, I agree.

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,360
Shit, I remember that!

48
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,360
Your gran's house.

49
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,240
Officially the ugliest vase ever.

50
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,040
I can't bring myself to chuck it out.

51
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,760
It was the one last thing
she gave me before she died.

52
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,160
Are you OK?

53
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,360
Yeah. Sure?

54
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,160
Yeah, I'm fine.

55
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,560
We used to raid her drinks cabinet
when she was at church

56
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,520
and mix cocktails in it.
Remember? What was it again?

57
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,200
Sambuca and Um Bongo...

58
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,640
They drink it in the Congo.

59
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,160
Which somehow I seriously doubt.

60
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,160
Sam, this is Frankie. Frankie, Sam.

61
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,000
We met.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,120
Do you mind if I borrow this?
I've got court this morning.

63
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,520
What are you planning to do?
Flash the judge?

64
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,440
You got to use what you got.

65
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,720
Yeah, I'd better go. The driver
will be doing his nut with Tess.

66
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,080
I'll come and see her off.

67
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,600
Bye bye, roomie.

68
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,560
Love you.

69
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,800
Love you, too.

70
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,160
Bye.

71
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,280
Oh, my God! "Love in the afternoon."

72
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,680
Come on.

73
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,080
Ugh!

74
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,320
Want to meet for lunch?

75
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,400
I doubt I'll be finished. These
things have a habit of dragging on.

76
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,480
I'd love to watch you in court. Yeah?

77
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,000
It's just like it is on the telly.
Really? Oh, yeah.

78
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,200
Yeah, good looking jury,
a wise old beak.

79
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,800
Me on the stand,
being viciously cross-examined

80
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,360
by a curiously sexy Glenn Close.

81
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,800
Shit!

82
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,000
What? My boss.
I don't want to be late.

83
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,320
Not when he's so pleased with me
already. I'll call you later. OK.

84
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,360
Give my regards to Glenn!

85
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,520
Morning.

86
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,760
Morning. My office, five minutes.

87
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,000
Is this it?

88
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,640
I guess so.

89
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,760
Is it legit?

90
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:11,160
Oh, my God! This is amazing!

91
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,280
Nice one, Sadie.

92
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,800
You should shag
a letting agent more often. Yeah! 

93
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,080
Uh!

94
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,280
My world may be turning to shit,
but yes, we have some bongos.

95
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,920
So, no doubt you heard
our bright young intern

96
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,960
had an attack of the vapours
in the office? Yeah.

97
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,920
Yeah, she hasn't been back.
Is she still ill? 

98
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,640
Ill? Yeah, well
that's what I assumed. Ketamine.

99
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,600
Sorry? Commonly prescribed by vets
as a horse tranquiliser.

100
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,960
It seems like it's the drug
of choice for our Hayley.

101
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,840
Shit! Really? I had no idea.

102
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,360
No? No! Course not.

103
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,880
I can't believe it. She's bright
and keen and good at her job.

104
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,400
Not any more. I had to fire her.

105
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,600
You see, the thing is, Cat,
you interviewed her, hm?

106
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,800
You recommended her,
she's your protege.

107
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,960
I thought you might've noticed
she was taking drugs in the office.

108
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,240
I didn't notice anything. Obviously.
If I had, I would've done something.

109
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,360
Yeah, you have been
a bit distracted lately.

110
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,800
Is that your new squeeze
I saw this morning?

111
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,880
Her name's Sam. Sam?
Yeah, that's right, yeah.

112
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,640
Which of the noble Sapphic
professions does Sam belong to?

113
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,560
Social worker? PE teacher?
Freelance yoghurt maker?

114
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,000
She's a Detective Sergeant. Oh!

115
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,080
Well, maybe she'll be able to
give you a few pointers next time.

116
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,320
How to spot suspicious behaviour?

117
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,560
So what it's like
working at Cat and Jay's?

118
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,680
Fascinating. I'm the Annie Leibovitz
of architectural photography.

119
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,760
Well, at least you've got a job.

120
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,320
What are you up to today?

121
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,600
Thought I'd take a spin
round the Italian Centre.

122
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,160
New handbag, haircut.

123
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,120
Just a bit of fun with
my never-ending disposable income. 
Enjoy that. I will.

124
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,400
Then again, I might just watch Lou
on the telly and drink my own body
weight in gin. Tess, get over it!

125
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,360
Plenty more lesbians in the loch.
Mm? You reckon!

126
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,800
Trouble with you is
you don't know where to look.

127
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,640
Ah.

128
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,440
There you go.
"What you want, when you want it."

129
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,480
Easy as ordering a pizza.

130
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,640
No. Absolutely not.
I'm not that desperate.

131
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,600
It's full of skanks and psychos.

132
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,720
What d'you want your
user name to be? Clitoris.

133
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,640
And how are you spelling that?
Frankie, I don't want to do it.

134
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,920
What's the alternative?

135
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,520
Sitting round here, pining after
someone you can't have? Yeah.

136
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,320
It doesn't work.

137
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,160
Just put a profile up
and see what happens.

138
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,440
Ah, OK.

139
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,920
What you looking for?

140
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,960
Friendship first? Fun?

141
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,000
Fisting?

142
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,440
Fisting.

143
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,800
Did you know about Hayley?

144
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,480
Hayley? What about her?

145
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,000
She was off her tits.
Ketamine, for chrissake.

146
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,240
Who said that? Alistair.

147
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,560
That's why she keeled over
the other day.

148
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,440
Did you know she was on something?

149
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,080
No, of course not. How would I know?
Exactly!

150
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,600
Why would you take drugs in
the office anyway? Stupid girl!

151
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,520
God, I hope she's all right.

152
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,760
I don't know why you're so worried.
It's not your fault.

153
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,520
That's not what Alistair thinks.

154
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,120
He's been weird with me ever since
I turned down his weekend cottage.

155
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,000
Sheep shagging in Shetland.

156
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,320
Then he finally susses I'm gay,

157
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,400
it's given him a whole
new stick to beat me with.

158
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,160
Listen, don't worry about it,
it'll all blow over.

159
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,760
I was right.

160
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,720
I've just been browsing members
in this area and they're all...

161
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,800
What's that? Nothing.

162
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,080
Are you OK?

163
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm going to go to work.

164
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,760
Listen, don't tell Cat
about Hayley, OK? Why?

165
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,960
Alistair's blaming her,

166
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,520
she doesn't need to know
I had anything to do with it.

167
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,640
What? So Cat takes all the flak
while you waltz away?

168
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,160
It's not like that.

169
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,320
Ssh.

170
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,720
Hiya.

171
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,520
Oh!

172
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,120
Thanks.

173
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,280
I've downloaded the images
from the Haybridge Court Project,

174
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,160
so we can take a look at them now.

175
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,560
What? You. Straight to business.
It's not like you.

176
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,360
What's that supposed to mean?

177
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,040
Frankie. I'm just trying
to do my job, all right? Christ!

178
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,240
What's the matter?

179
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,880
Frankie, what's going on?
And don't say nothing.

180
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,920
Nothing.

181
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,120
You're a crap liar. Come on,
you're all over the place.

182
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,440
All right. You want to know
what's going on?

183
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,880
I'm dead.

184
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,120
What?

185
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,120
I don't understand,
the date on this...?

186
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,800
The same day my parents died.
The car crash.

187
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,120
Francesca Alan died on the same day
as her parents.

188
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,200
But you survived.
Your aunt and uncle...

189
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,480
Took me in. Little orphan Frankie.

190
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,000
No, no, they didn't
because she was dead.

191
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,040
Frankie...

192
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,240
Fuck! This is...

193
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,440
So you're not who they said,
who they told you you were?

194
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,760
It's a total mindfuck. Yeah.

195
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,960
Yeah, it is.

196
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,520
But you know what?
I'm not even surprised.

197
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,440
What d'you mean?

198
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,800
I always knew that there was
something that they weren't
telling me, some secret.

199
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,720
Conversations would stop
when I walked into rooms,

200
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,880
closed doors and whisperings and...

201
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,520
I'm just trying to make sense of it.

202
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,480
This... And the photo album.

203
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,200
So who is she? Your aunt wanted her
to have the photos.

204
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,920
Do you think
she could be your mother?

205
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,520
Your real mother?

206
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,480
Frankie, it's OK. No, it's not!

207
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,080
That's the one thing it's not.

208
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,440
Later in the programme we'll be
talking to life coach Debbie Spatz,

209
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,280
about the joy of spontaneous living.

210
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:28,960
What the hell does Lou know about
spontaneous living? Scheming witch!

211
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,600
Mute her! Mute her!

212
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,200
Look at how much make-up
they've put on to cover the bruise!

213
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,080
Don't mess with The Fist!

214
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,600
Feeble exterior
of a young Woody Allen,

215
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,440
awesome fire power of Vin Diesel.

216
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,240
COMPUTER PINGS

217
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,880
What's that?

218
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,280
Nothing. It's Frankie trying
to get me back on the scene.

219
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,960
Internet dating? I know.

220
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,080
Seriously, I mean, you should
look at some of these girls.

221
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,800
Most of them are just desperate hets
after a free lezzy floor show.

222
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,720
How can you tell? Easy, look.

223
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,800
Like hell she's bi.

224
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,560
Why the hell do they have to
have a dog in the picture?

225
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,200
I do find spaniels
particularly erotic.

226
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,880
Oh, and then there's this one.
My favourite.

227
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:18,880
Berlin Mary. "Back in Glasgow.
Zis time I am super horny.

228
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,240
"First we will have the sex. Then
we will proceed to the next level."

229
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,640
COMPUTER PINGS

230
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,280
What's that? It just means
someone's interested.

231
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,040
Don't get excited,
it'll just be another minger.

232
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,080
She's all right. Really?

233
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,040
She is, isn't she? She's hot.

234
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,560
Do you think she's hot?

235
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,480
COMPUTER PINGS

236
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,960
She wants to chat. I can't do it, my
fingers are sweaty. You do it. No!

237
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,640
Go on, you're the writer.
Write something funny, witty, sexy

238
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,080
so she'll think I'm fantastic
and want to go out with me.

239
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,680
Actually, I have to go.
What? Where are you going?

240
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,080
I've got a date. What?

241
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,720
At three o'clock in the afternoon?
You never said.

242
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,120
I don't tell you everything.
Except that you do.

243
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,400
Who's the lucky girl?

244
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,240
Melanie.
In my creative writing class.

245
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,760
She's really nice.

246
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,320
Obsessed with Philip Roth.

247
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,240
Oh, I love him! Pulp Fiction.
That scene in the diner. Remember?

248
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,720
No, that's Tim Roth.

249
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,040
I'm talking about Philip Roth.
Celebrated New York Jewish novelist,

250
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,080
not a bloody actor.

251
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,760
All right! Don't get punchy.

252
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:24,560
Is this what you're going to be like
since your little street fight?
I'm off. Enjoy your internet date.

253
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,800
I never said
I was going to meet her!

254
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,800
Why don't I talk to Sam?

255
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,400
No. Why not? Least she could see
if Annie Cawthorne's ever come up?

256
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,880
You have an address for her.

257
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,480
Don't tell her.
I don't want anyone to know, OK?

258
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,160
Then how else are you going to
find out who she is?

259
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,560
Do you think she'd even do it?

260
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,000
Probably, if I asked her.

261
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You've got her wrapped around
your finger, have you?

262
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,040
No. Sam's a grown-up.

263
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,080
In fact this might be my first
attempt at a grown-up relationship.

264
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,200
And before you say it,
that doesn't mean it's boring.

265
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:09,000
Yeah, I wasn't going to say that.
I'm pleased for you.

266
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,640
No, you're not!

267
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,480
Well, someone should be happy.
It might as well be you.

268
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,000
So how's the new place?

269
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It's mental. Massive.

270
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,680
You should drop by sometime,
take a look.

271
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,320
Yeah. Yeah, I might.

272
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,040
Maths homework?

273
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,760
Becky's arranged for us to see
a mortgage adviser.

274
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,240
God, it's fun all the way
with you two.

275
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,400
Oh, God!

276
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,800
You know how long it's going to
take me to pay this...thing off?

277
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,480
30 years!

278
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,560
30 years of fucking wage slaving.

279
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,520
Not to mention your other costs.

280
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,280
What? Your nanny. Your vets bills.

281
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,160
Your 2.4 are going to want a pet.

282
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,240
Hi, Sam, it's me.

283
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,160
Good. Can you do me a favour?

284
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,960
I just need you to look someone up.
Is that OK?

285
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,360
Oh, it's not for me.

286
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,600
It's for one of the secretaries.

287
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,520
Annie Cawthorne.

288
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,560
48 Claydon Court...

289
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,920
Ashmill Estate...

290
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,960
Glasgow.

291
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,280
Talk to anyone
who's done internet dating,

292
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,840
we've all got war stories. And you?

293
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,280
Right, the worst was this teacher.
Faye.

294
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,960
Great profile,
talked for ages online.

295
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,560
In the flesh she was like something
out of Jane Austen.

296
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:43,720
Yeah, but underneath the corset...?
We didn't get that far, believe me.

297
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,480
I knew as soon as I met her

298
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,240
she didn't have the right
sense of adventure.

299
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,040
You're adventurous, aren't you, Tess?
Mmm, yeah, course.

300
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,880
You want another?

301
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,480
Yeah. I'll get them.

302
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,800
You stay here and enjoy the view.

303
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,440
Two Ezos, please.

304
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,360
Hi.

305
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,000
Hi.

306
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,320
You look familiar.

307
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,360
No, I don't think so. Maybe.

308
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,040
Ooh.

309
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,360
So then I did my dissertation

310
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,680
on post-modern identity
in the American novel

311
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,200
and that's when I really fell
in love with Roth. Wow.

312
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,080
What?

313
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,520
You've got a bit of crisp
on your lip.

314
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,960
There?

315
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,600
No, it's just underneath.

316
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,880
Do you want me to?

317
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,400
Thanks.

318
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,640
I had a date
in a coffee shop once

319
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,560
and I thought it had gone really
well, but when I went to the loos,

320
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,680
I realised I had chocolate from
my cappuccino all over my lip.

321
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,440
A little cocoa Hitler moustache?

322
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,120
No, big curly whirly
impresario affair.

323
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,720
Fetching!

324
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,800
I've got a friend called Tess.

325
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,880
She's an actress.

326
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,440
She did this play once where
she had to wear a false beard,

327
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,000
a big bushy white thing.

328
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,080
Trouble is, they stuck it on with the
wrong stuff, superglue or something,

329
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,040
she was wispy for weeks.

330
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,400
Oh, my God!

331
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,640
No, she liked it. She said
it made her feel Christmassy.

332
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,200
She sounds mental.

333
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:44,440
Yeah, she is. She's great,
but she's also...frustrating.

334
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,360
She's one of these people
who can't see what's right
in front of her, you know?

335
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,040
Like she can't appreciate
what she's already got.

336
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,120
Do you want another?

337
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,760
Er... Yeah!

338
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,600
Over the top, over the top.

339
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,000
Whoa!

340
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,440
Turn it round. Eh?

341
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,440
The other way.

342
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,640
Um...

343
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,920
What the fuck?

344
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,920
All right, hen.

345
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,440
Sorry, um... Who is this?

346
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,960
This is Dougie.

347
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,000
Douglas.

348
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,320
My husband, but don't worry, he just
likes to watch. Now where were we?

349
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,360
No, no, no, I'm sorry.
I thought you were gay.

350
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,080
We're more...

351
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,280
bi-curious.

352
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,360
BANGING

353
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,080
Whoa! What was that?

354
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,880
It's just Lady. What lady?

355
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,120
No, Lady! Our Allie.
Our German Shepherd.

356
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,520
Goes a bit frantic when
we shut him in the kitchen.

357
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,120
Um, I think I'm...

358
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,200
You see! This is my problem.

359
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,040
Why don't you look at me
like that any more?

360
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,440
HOWLING

361
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,880
It's like Roth's books.

362
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,440
They're almost anti-love stories.
Yeah.

363
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,720
You know? The pain, the...
The inescapable despair of desire.

364
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,840
Yeah. How... How love fractures us.
Yeah. Leaves us in pieces. Doomed.

365
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,720
It's doomed to failure.

366
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,800
I just find it...

367
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,360
Captivating. Depressing.

368
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,960
Another drink?

369
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,320
Erm... No, I'd better not.
I've got an early lecture tomorrow.

370
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,680
You're good. I've a friend called
Tess. She doesn't know when to stop.

371
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,720
Spirits and then shots
and that's when she gets really wild.

372
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,800
You know, like really self obsessed.

373
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,840
Like she's the only one in the world,
the only one that matters.

374
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,120
Are you going already?

375
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,680
It's been great.

376
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,320
A really great date.

377
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,240
Can we do this again?

378
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,800
Look, I'll call you.

379
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,560
You see, this is marriage, Tess.

380
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,240
First the excitement goes,
then the passion.

381
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,400
Baby, dunnae...
Don't "baby" me, I'm serious.

382
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,600
Um, can I just...

383
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,240
Thanks.

384
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,960
That's why we thought
about the internet dating.

385
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,480
It hasn't gone as well
as we hoped, has it, Doug?

386
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,000
Douglas, at least look at me
while I'm talking to you!

387
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,640
Well, look, I... I think it's really
great that you're trying. Do you?

388
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,200
Yeah, yeah!

389
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,200
Anything you can do
to keep the passion alive.

390
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,080
It's like cooking, isn't it?

391
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,640
You can have shepherd's pie
every night,

392
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,720
but why not add a little spice?

393
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:13,200
Some chilli, pepper,
a bit of turmeric...

394
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,680
Aye, that's very good.
That's very profound.

395
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,040
You should be on the television,
Tess. You're very good at this.

396
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,480
Cos that's all I want.

397
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,160
To make Dougie happy.

398
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,520
Aye, me too, Hen.

399
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,040
Me, too.

400
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,880
Um...

401
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,360
I'll just let myself out.

402
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:43,120
Sorry, I didn't realise
it had gotten so late.

403
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,360
I should've rung you.

404
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,600
It's all right. You OK?

405
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:51,160
Just about. Their defence barrister
is a bitch in horsehair.

406
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,120
My brain hurts.

407
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,840
Poor brain.

408
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,120
Do you want a drink? Yes.

409
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,520
Sam? Mmm?

410
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,720
I was just wondering
if you had a chance

411
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,040
to do that thing for me,
look up that name?

412
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,160
Mm, I did.

413
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,080
Great, thank you so much.

414
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,840
So did you find anything out?

415
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,160
The only Cawthorne
registered to that address

416
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,240
is an alias for an Alma Carter.

417
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,840
Alias? She's a criminal?

418
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,640
Yeah, small time.

419
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,760
She's got a couple of priors
for theft,

420
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,960
but we're talking way back,
30 years or more.

421
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,080
Thanks. Thanks for doing that.

422
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,120
No problem.

423
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,080
Who did you say it was for?

424
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,920
You said it was someone at work?

425
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,120
Yeah. Yeah, just one
of the secretaries.

426
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,920
She's having a few family issues.

427
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,800
It's nice of you to help her.

428
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,160
SIREN

429
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,040
DOOR BUZZES

430
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,040
Hey.
Don't look too pleased to see me.

431
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:20,600
Sorry.
Or were you expecting someone else?

432
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,720
No, I just... I didn't know
you were coming, that's all.

433
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,640
Wanted to see how you were
settling in? Like it?

434
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,320
Yeah, it's all right. Yeah.

435
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,080
All right? It fucking rocks!

436
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,040
Do you know how lucky you are
to be shagging me?

437
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,000
To another satisfied client.

438
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,880
What?

439
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,840
Let's just have a drink, yeah?

440
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,760
Don't worry, I can multi-task.

441
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,640
Yeah. Sadie, don't.

442
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,120
Come on, is this all the thanks
I'm going to get?

443
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,840
What? So I've got to fuck you
just cos you found me a flat?

444
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,280
Cos I didn't ask you to.

445
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,000
For God's sake,
that's not what I meant.

446
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,960
What's wrong with you tonight?
Nothing's wrong with me.

447
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,880
I'm just not in the mood.

448
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,600
Suit yourself.

449
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,040
Your loss.

450
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,360
What did I do to deserve this?

451
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,320
I just felt like it.

452
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,200
Ah, that is good.

453
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,280
Mm, my first and last
decent cup of the day.

454
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,760
The coffee at court tastes vile.

455
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,200
I can make you a flask?

456
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,960
Let's wait till
we're really middle-aged.

457
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,200
Hey, don't forget
this Annie Cawthorne stuff.

458
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,840
Want some?

459
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,200
I made it for you.

460
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,840
Yeah, and I want to share it.

461
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,840
Oh, shit. What?

462
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,080
Oh, God!

463
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,000
What's the problem?
Lunch with my parents! Today!

464
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,200
That's the problem. Your parents?

465
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,360
You could come with me. What?

466
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,760
You're my girlfriend.
You should meet my parents.

467
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,200
Are you sure?

468
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,680
I'm sure.

469
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,120
I'll call you later.

470
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,680
Shit!

471
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,200
Now you remember the time, right?

472
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,120
And please try to stay tidy
because we need to look
serious and committed.

473
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,360
Committed?
You should be in that tie.

474
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,080
Thanks, Frankie, always nice to have
your support.

475
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,880
We're meeting our
financial advisor later.

476
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,800
Three o'clock. Don't be late.

477
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,320
I won't.

478
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,120
Dead Man Walking.

479
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,440
It's a mortgage, Frankie.
Not a death sentence.

480
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,040
Yeah. Loving the noose.

481
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,680
Look, you can take the piss
all you want but this is not
the end for me, all right?

482
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:19,680
I have options. Choices.
It's not like I'm stuck on a path.

483
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:23,920
It's not like I can't get off
if I want to. And do you?

484
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,840
You know Hayley?

485
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:34,280
She snogged me. Did she? No wonder
she had to take drugs. Frankie?

486
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,280
Um, Sam looked up
that thing you wanted.

487
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:46,560
Annie Cawthorne's an alias
for somebody called Alma Carter.

488
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,680
She has convictions.

489
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:52,240
Theft, but they're ancient,
like 30 years ago.

490
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,400
She's a criminal? Was.

491
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:59,000
Was. Sam said that these things on
the record, they're from ages ago,

492
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,560
so they probably don't count. Great.
That's just great. So I'm dead,

493
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:08,040
I'm connected to a criminal and
there's some strange drug dealer
bloke that keeps following me.

494
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,800
What bloke?

495
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:15,040
Where are you going?
Where do you think? Frankie.

496
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:33,000
And how dare they use me
to spice up their marriage?

497
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,040
Like I'm some kind of
lesbian court jester.

498
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,200
Tess, will you hurry up!
My mum's booked the table.

499
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,440
All these crazy femmes who
turn out to be straight and I
never notice, I never guess.

500
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,600
"Sense of adventure"?

501
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,120
That was not an adventure.

502
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,480
And you know the worst thing?
Fine, I'll just wait then.

503
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,160
The worse thing is, I got hit on!

504
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:53,320
I passed up a really fit lesbian
and for what?

505
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,720
A heterosexual freak show.

506
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,760
Tess,
what the hell are you looking at?

507
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,960
Nothing. Birds.

508
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,880
Flying up in the thing...

509
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,880
Right, OK, I'm ready.

510
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,400
Where's my coat?

511
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,760
Tiramisu with Judy and Gerry.

512
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,400
Who could say no?

513
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,240
I think this is lovely.

514
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,000
Gerry, for goodness' sake.

515
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,280
He likes to build things.
..Gerry? I was just saying,

516
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,960
this is lovely, isn't it?

517
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,000
Yes, it's nice to see you all.

518
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,760
Thank you for making a...

519
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,920
you know.

520
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,440
And to meet Cat's new girlfriend.

521
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,640
Super! And a police woman?

522
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,960
Have you been at "the nick"
this morning, Sam?

523
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:49,480
Um, actually I've been in court,
giving evidence against
a serial rapist.

524
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,440
Rape. Now that is not very nice.

525
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,680
Conjunctivitis is
not very nice, Mother.

526
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:00,160
But rape, I think, qualifies as
something slightly worse than that.

527
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,800
She takes things very literally,
our Catherine, always has.

528
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,720
I think she might
be slightly autistic.

529
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,600
So, the police service?

530
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,720
That must be very rewarding,
decent salary? Mum! Please.

531
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,080
It's OK. When you join up, you
know what you let yourself in for.

532
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,440
Public service pay and a polyester
uniform. Winning combination.

533
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,280
Super!

534
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:02,760
Of course Ed's doing so well
writing his very own science book.

535
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,240
Science fiction, Mum.
That's what I said, darling.

536
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,680
And Tess, still acting?

537
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,440
Oh, you know me, Judy.
I just go with the flow,
like a piece of driftwood.

538
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,600
Ha-ha. Such a free spirit.

539
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,040
And then there's Cat with her...

540
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,440
architecture.

541
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,520
You see, that's the problem.

542
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,280
Very long training, expensive.

543
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,720
It's a big investment for
everyone for uncertain rewards.

544
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:34,720
Still, you always put your dreams on
hold for your children, don't you?

545
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,640
It must be worth it, Judy?

546
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,040
You know, seeing all that
Catherine's achieved and knowing she
couldn't have done it without you?

547
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,520
Well, yes.

548
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:49,560
Exactly, yes.
And we're all very proud, yes.

549
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,840
So?

550
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,760
Little Francesca. Can I come in?

551
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,880
You turned your back on us,
young lady.

552
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,440
Our door's always been open to you.

553
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,080
I'm sorry.

554
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,160
The funeral. I was out of line.

555
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,720
I want to ask you something.

556
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,680
About me...

557
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:33,960
where I came from.
New York, wasn't it?

558
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:38,840
I find it hard to keep up with you
girls. As a baby. Where you got me.

559
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,000
The birds and the bees, Francesca.

560
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,560
Isn't it a bit late for all that?

561
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,320
I'm not Francesca though, am I?

562
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,840
Where did you get this?
The registry office.

563
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,400
Everything we did
was in your best interests.

564
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,840
And who is Alma Carter?

565
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,200
Is she my mother?

566
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,160
My real mother?

567
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,600
I don't know who you're talking
about. I've never heard of this.

568
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:38,960
Alma Carter! Aunt Carol sent her
my photo album before she died.

569
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,560
I'm sorry.

570
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:45,960
Jesus, am I even related to you at
all? Are you anything to do with me?

571
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,800
Oh, hello, Gillian.

572
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,080
You remember my niece?

573
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:56,680
I'd like to help you so I'm
telling you this for your own good.

574
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,880
Stop looking, asking questions.

575
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,880
You won't like the answer.

576
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,960
Alma Carter's not interested.

577
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,280
Not then.

578
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,320
Not now.

579
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,240
She didn't want you.

580
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,320
Excuse me.
Could we have the bill, please?

581
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,840
Yeah, sure.

582
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:52,520
Oh, you might want to powder your
nose if you're in there, darling.

583
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,840
She's such an attractive girl Tess,
don't you think, Gerry?

584
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:03,360
And these two make a
very attractive couple.

585
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:08,000
Have you thought about it, Edward?
She could be the one? What?

586
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,960
No, no, she's not the one, Mother.

587
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,320
There is no one, OK?

588
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,240
I'm not seeing anyone, not
going anywhere... I'm stuck.

589
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,880
Sorry, isn't Tess...?

590
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,880
Gay? Yes, she is.
As my mother is only too well aware.

591
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,960
I think we're all a bit gay, dear,
aren't we?

592
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,400
That's the trouble with Ed, he lets
everything become an obstacle.

593
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,520
PHONE RINGS

594
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,200
Excuse me.

595
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,800
Hello?

596
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,160
Yeah? Sadie, where are you?

597
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,360
Oi! You stopped being
a moody twat then, have you?

598
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,120
Whose is this place?
Last night's conquest.

599
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:30,200
A tragic little banker
called Josephine that I
picked up at Babylon.

600
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,840
She was a crap shag though.
All toys and no imagination.

601
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,760
Oh, yeah?

602
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,840
So this Josephine, where is she now?

603
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,480
Don't tell me you've left her
tied up upstairs?

604
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,880
No, she got an early flight to
Charles de Gaulle this morning,

605
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,120
leaving yours truly
holding the keys.

606
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,600
Thank you. For what? You were great.
The way you handled my mother!

607
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,280
Ah well, I guess I've just had a
lot of practice dealing with...

608
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,000
Psychopaths?
Cat, your mother's not a psycho.

609
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,120
She's just more borderline
personality disorder. Really?

610
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,600
So what does that make me? You?

611
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,240
Where do I start?

612
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,080
I can't do this.

613
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,000
You seem to be doing all right.

614
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,240
No, I can't. It's...

615
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,680
You've been
so great today and it just...

616
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,480
makes me feel even shittier.

617
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,480
I lied to you. About what?

618
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,320
That name.
It wasn't for one of the secretaries.

619
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,880
It was for Frankie.

620
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,520
Of course it was.

621
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,480
I was just wondering when
you were going to tell me.

622
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,840
You knew?

623
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,720
What's my job?

624
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:05,520
I know! And I'm a terrible liar.
It's just...

625
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,440
Frankie asked me
not to tell anyone. About what?

626
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,880
Oh, nothing. It's just she doesn't
want anyone to know about her stuff.

627
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:18,640
Cat, is there, um... Is there
anything that I need to worry about?

628
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,200
You and Frankie, you know, you
obviously go back a long way and...

629
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:28,400
She's... She's a friend, that's all.
Not even a very good one.

630
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,720
OK.

631
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,880
But you have
absolutely nothing to worry about.

632
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,400
OK!

633
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,920
Just don't lie to me again.

634
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,800
Do you want to go for a drink? Yeah?

635
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,280
MUSIC BLARING

636
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,040
On your marks! Get your car keys!

637
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,640
Good stuff.

638
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:37,040
Private prescription,
maximum strength.

639
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,400
Question is, how many do I need?

640
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,080
Depends on how much
you want to forget.

641
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:01,920
Look at you.
Two cocktails and you're anybody's.

642
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,880
Not anybody's. Yours.

643
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,040
The taxi driver won't like it.

644
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,760
He's a Daily Mail reader.

645
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,520
Fuck him.

646
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:56,200
No, don't fuck him.

647
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,720
Fuck me.

648
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,680
Frankie?

649
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,680
What the fuck are you doing?

650
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:08,360
Rape. Now that's not very nice.

651
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,880
Genocide, also not very nice.

652
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,040
Right, I'm off. No, no, no, no!
I haven't said the best bit!

653
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:20,240
The best bit was when your mum
accused Cat of being autistic.

654
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:25,320
And then there was your dad,
counting cutlery
like he's in fucking Rainman.

655
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,680
Yay! He smiles!

656
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,760
You know,
you're my best audience, Ed.

657
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,240
In fact you're my only audience,
so you must never leave me.

658
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,240
Do you know what else my mum said?
What?

659
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:47,280
She said we'd make
a really attractive couple. Mental!

660
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,480
Yeah.

661
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:54,400
DOOR BUZZER
I'll get it.

662
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,360
Surprise! Ho, ho, ho! Nice pad!

663
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,920
All right, babe? Jay!

664
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,000
Let's get the party started!

665
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,840
Look at the size of this place!

666
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,120
Shave for me.

667
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,880
What?

668
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,200
Everything.

669
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,720
Shave it all off.

670
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,720
I've only got a landing strip.

671
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,360
Open your legs.

672
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,240
Wider.

673
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:58,000
Lift your head up.

674
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:03,040
Put your arm behind your head.

675
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,520
KNOCK ON DOOR

676
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:41,040
Hello?

677
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:44,240
Josephine, is that you?

678
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,760
It's me, Lainie,
I'm here to feed your fish.

679
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,000
Look, this is a mistake.

680
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,200
We're friends of Jackie's...
Josephine's.

681
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,360
That's not true. I've been cleaning
here for three years.

682
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,680
I've never seen these
people before in my life.

683
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,080
She's lying. How would you know?

684
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,640
We were together last night.

685
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,160
Quite the squealer is Josephine.

686
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:12,080
I think the best thing would be for
you two to come down to the station.

687
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,920
We'll try and sort all this out,
get in touch with the owner.

688
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:19,160
Paris, you say? No, no. You don't
want to do that. And why's that?

689
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,680
Call Sam Murray. She's a detective
sergeant. She'll sort this out.

690
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:31,320
Is that right? Yeah, cos this isn't
what it looks like and I wouldn't
want you to make a mistake.

691
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,960
No! Look...

692
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,760
What are you doing?
Just leave me to deal with this.

693
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,280
I know what I'm doing.

694
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:18,520
Tess, have we got any crisps?

695
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:22,520
Sweeties? Brownie mix? Anything?

696
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,760
Tess?

697
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:29,080
What you looking at? Oh, nothing.
Just another missed opportunity.

698
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,560
How much have you had to drink?
Not enough.

699
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,880
Cheers.

700
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:45,720
They were left in the house, Clive.
It's implied consent.

701
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,960
I'm just sorry you
got dragged into it.

702
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,480
OK.

703
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:00,640
Tell me why should I do this? Why
should I have to vouch for you two?

704
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,960
Who is this, Frankie? This?

705
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,880
This is Sadie. My girlfriend.

706
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,280
Your girlfriend, Frankie?

707
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,960
Your standards are dropping.
Piss off.

708
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:16,160
Just clean up this mess
and get the hell out of here.

709
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:22,000
I'm so, so sorry.

710
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,160
You cheated! Suck it up.

711
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,640
Yay! Stranger!

712
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,120
What happened to you? Not much.

713
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,440
How was your day?

714
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:57,760
Fabulous.
You didn't get your mortgage then?

715
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,200
No. We did.

716
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:16,000
Oh, my God. I need my bed.

717
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,880
The room's spinning.
Have a glass of water.

718
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,960
Have a go on this bad boy.
No, thanks.

719
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:26,960
Ed, you can stay in
my bed if you want.

720
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,720
I'm going to go home.
Get the last bus.

721
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:36,280
You should stay. The state she's
in you won't even need rohypnol.

722
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:40,560
Piss off, Frankie.
See you later, Teddy boy.

723
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,520
See ya.

724
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:54,680
So...what do you want to do now?

725
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,680
I want another drink.

726
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:02,520
What's...? I'm sure I saw something.

727
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,600
Yeah, is that... What's that?
Is that tequila?

728
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,400
Looks like tequila!

729
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,360
Urgh, it smells like Domestos.

730
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,720
Aaah!

731
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,560
Christ, I shouldn't drink any more.

732
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,520
Who said?

733
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,320
PHONE RINGS

734
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:27,880
Oh!

735
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,680
Ring ring!

736
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,400
Becky.

737
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,720
Uh-oh. What's going on with you two?

738
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:40,080
Nothing, nothing. It's all good.

739
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:43,080
I love Becky. I do...

740
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:46,280
At least I think I do.
I'm pretty sure...

741
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:49,520
But how do you know?
How do you know?

742
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,320
You're asking me?

743
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,920
It's just this...

744
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,320
It's just this moving in thing.

745
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:00,840
I just feel as if I'm being pushed,
like I'm signing my life away for
something I'm not even sure I want.

746
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:04,880
It's like my heart says one thing
but my cock's saying another.

747
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,560
Am I making...? I'm...

748
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,800
I'm not making any sense, am I?

749
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:13,800
Oh, God, I'm pissed.

750
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,120
Get you!

751
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,080
You're so...

752
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:24,760
controlled. Got it all together.

753
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:29,920
You what? Good old Frankie.
Doesn't say anything.

754
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:33,840
Doesn't get sucked in.
Fuck and run Frankie.

755
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,960
You don't know anything.

756
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:46,520
So, tell me, Frankie,
this love thing.

757
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:49,480
Is there someone...anyone...

758
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:54,040
that grabs your heart
and fucks with your head?

759
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,720
Cos I don't know if I can do it.

760
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,640
Frankie?

761
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:14,200
Cat. It's always been Cat.

762
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,760
Of course it has.

763
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,880
Oi...

764
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,080
Oh, Christ.

765
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,600
Hey...

766
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:42,280
Poor Frankie.

767
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,240
Poor pissed Frankie

768
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,320
with her sad eyes.

769
00:55:56,680 --> 00:56:00,240
You saw. Couldn't help it.

770
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,000
It was nothing. It was Jay!

771
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,800
It was a fucking mistake!

772
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:07,640
When did you know that you loved her?
When does anyone know?

773
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:10,120
There's not much to celebrate.

774
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,480
It's your 30th! Exactly.
Why don't we just do it at my flat?

775
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,240
As long as it doesn't
get too messy again.

776
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:18,320
Strolling down memory lane
behind Sam's back... I was working!

777
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:22,520
Why didn't he just like go for it
with her? Would she reciprocate?

778
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,800
Well, you're the writer.
Make it happen.
