明明是你逼我们来的…
You said we had to, so...

5
00:00:26,223 --> 00:00:27,490
我该把羊毛衫带上的
I should have brought my cardigan.

6
00:00:27,491 --> 00:00:29,359
我有一个关于我们餐厅的消息要宣布
I have an announcement about the restaurant.

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,960
这个盒子里面 是特别的牛肉
Here in this box is the beef

8
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:33,796
它将要做成我们的… Gene 来点鼓声

9
00:00:40,304 --> 00:00:41,771

Gene
Gene.

11
00:00:43,641 --> 00:00:45,775
这里 在这个盒子里装着的牛肉
Here in this box is the beef

12
00:00:45,776 --> 00:00:47,644
将会做成我们的第10万个汉堡
That will make our 100,000th burger.

13
00:00:47,645 --> 00:00:48,645
哇
Wow.

14
00:00:48,646 --> 00:00:49,646
我能摸摸它吗
Can I touch it 

15
00:00:49,647 --> 00:00:51,247
我也想摸摸它
I wanna touch it, too.

16
00:00:51,248 --> 00:00:53,249
我想用脚踩踩
I wanna feel it between my toes. Mmm.

17
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,418
我想插根炸药
I wanna put a stick of dynamite in it

18
00:00:55,419 --> 00:00:56,519
然后把它炸飞!
And blow it up!

19
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,154
天呐 你们都怎么了
No. What is wrong with all of you

20
00:00:58,155 --> 00:00:59,589
除了我 谁也不能碰这块肉
No one's touching this meat but me.

21
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,224
我也有个消息要宣布
I have an announcement, too.

22
00:01:01,225 --> 00:01:02,592
胸罩擦着我疼
My bra is chafing me.

23
00:01:02,593 --> 00:01:03,893
这不值得宣布
That's not a real announcement.

24
00:01:03,894 --> 00:01:04,894
喔!我想到了一个
Oh! I have one.

25
00:01:04,895 --> 00:01:06,396
我喜欢...
I love...

26
00:01:06,397 --> 00:01:07,397
豪斯音乐
House music.

27
00:01:07,398 --> 00:01:08,864
哇!我终于把它说出来了!
There! I said it!

28
00:01:09,767 --> 00:01:12,302
我马上要拿到我的持枪执照了
And I'm going to get my gun license,

29
00:01:12,303 --> 00:01:13,303

喔 恭喜你
Oh, congratulations.

31
00:01:14,605 --> 00:01:17,006
我简直不敢相信他们居然让你等了3天
Can't believe they're making you wait 3 days.

32
00:01:17,007 --> 00:01:18,841
不要再抢白了! 
Stop stealing my thunder!

33
00:01:18,842 --> 00:01:21,444
我找到横幅了!
I found the banner!

34
00:01:21,445 --> 00:01:23,413
是从那台旧印刷机那里找到的
It's from our old printer.

35
00:01:23,414 --> 00:01:25,982
你只需要把旁边的小洞洞给撕下来
You just have to tear off the holes on the side.

36
00:01:25,983 --> 00:01:27,951
我们早就该卖出10万个汉堡了
We were supposed to hit 100,000 ages ago.

37
00:01:27,952 --> 00:01:29,686
呵呵 我们偏离计划了
Heh. We were way off.

38
00:01:29,687 --> 00:01:31,520
是啊 真是一个值得纪念的日子
Yeah. Big time.

39
00:01:32,423 --> 00:01:34,390
- 我能不能-- - 住手!
- Can I just-- - stop it!

40
00:01:34,942 --> 00:01:36,476
就是它
There it is.

41
00:01:36,477 --> 00:01:37,727
大家上!
Get it! Dive!

42
00:01:37,728 --> 00:01:38,961
哦 我的天啊
Oh, my God.

43
00:01:41,932 --> 00:01:44,434
请问你是第10万号吗
Are you number 100,000

44
00:01:44,435 --> 00:01:45,435
不
no.

45
00:01:45,436 --> 00:01:47,437
你对我生气了吗
are you mad at me

46
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:48,504
不
no.

47
00:01:48,505 --> 00:01:50,506
喔 汉堡 你真可爱

49
00:01:51,775 --> 00:01:53,276

50
00:01:53,277 --> 00:01:54,610
喔Linda!
Whoa. Linda!

51
00:01:54,611 --> 00:01:56,412
有人来采访我们了!
I think the news is here!

52
00:01:56,413 --> 00:01:58,982
他们应该已经听说了我们的第10万个汉堡!
I wonder if they heard about our 100,000th burger!

53
00:01:58,983 --> 00:02:00,550
什么!
What!

54
00:02:00,551 --> 00:02:03,453
你好能为你们做些什么吗
Hi. How are you Uh, what can I do for you

55
00:02:03,454 --> 00:02:04,487
你是Bob吗
Are you Bob

56
00:02:04,488 --> 00:02:05,788
呃 是的 没错
Uh, yeah. I am.

57
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:07,357
我是Randy Watkins 
I'm Randy Watkins,

58
00:02:07,358 --> 00:02:09,492
我是个纪录片制作人 
The documentary filmmaker.

59
00:02:09,493 --> 00:02:10,793
好的 呃...
Ok. Uh...

60
00:02:10,794 --> 00:02:12,929
我们正在制作一部关于牛肉行业的电影
We're making a film about the beef industry.

61
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,397
我听说你们将要卖出
I heard you were about to hit

62
00:02:14,398 --> 00:02:16,532
你们的第10万个汉堡
Your 100,000th burger,

63
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:19,335
所以我想要跟你握一下手
And I wanted to shake your hand.

64
00:02:19,336 --> 00:02:20,870
喔 好的 嗯...
Oh. Yeah. Um...

65
00:02:20,871 --> 00:02:24,340
因为先生 你的手上沾满了鲜血
Because you, sir, have blood on your hands.

66
00:02:24,341 --> 00:02:26,609
哟.这是番茄酱吗
Eww. Is this ketchup

67
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,711
这是被10万头被屠杀的牛的鲜血
It's the blood of 100,000 slaughtered cows.

68
00:02:28,712 --> 00:02:30,246
你怎么弄我一手番茄酱
You ketchuped me.

69
00:02:30,247 --> 00:02:32,782
我们在此是为了让你面对你的受害者
We're here to force you to face your victims.

70
00:02:32,783 --> 00:02:35,551
看看你的牛肉
Meet your meat.

71
00:02:35,552 --> 00:02:37,453
我勒个去~
What the hell

72
00:02:37,454 --> 00:02:39,355
她叫Moolissa
Her name is Moolissa.

73
00:02:39,356 --> 00:02:42,492
5天后将被杀掉
She's due to be "processed" in 5 days, Bob,

74
00:02:42,493 --> 00:02:44,694
除非你选择留下她的生命
Unless you choose to spare her life.

75
00:02:44,695 --> 00:02:46,629
- 什么 - 没错
- Wh-why  - That's right.

76
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,765
你将决定她的命运
You will decide her fate.

77
00:02:48,766 --> 00:02:52,602
这是一部奶牛生命倒计时器
It's a cow...Ntdown

78
00:02:52,603 --> 00:02:54,871
我们要看看当你面对汉堡
We'll see what your conscience tells you

79
00:02:54,872 --> 00:02:57,940
你的良心会作何反应
When you're looking your burger right in the eye.

80
00:02:57,941 --> 00:02:59,509
喔!这真是荒谬
Ow! This is ridiculous.

81
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,811
做汉堡又不是犯罪
It's not a crime to make burgers.

82
00:03:01,812 --> 00:03:03,946
我们的手上没有沾满鲜血!
There's no blood on our hands!

83
00:03:03,947 --> 00:03:07,016
你们在吵什么呢
What's all the yelling about

84
00:03:07,017 --> 00:03:10,820
原来爸爸一直用死牛肉做汉堡
 Turns out dad's been putting murdered cows in our hamburgers.

85
00:03:10,821 --> 00:03:13,556
还把我们变成了帮凶!
And you made us a part of it!

86
00:03:13,557 --> 00:03:14,824
你让我感到恶心
You make me sick.

87
00:03:14,825 --> 00:03:15,825
孩子们 不要这样
Kids, please.

88
00:03:15,826 --> 00:03:18,094
喔 看啊 奶牛
Oh, look. A cow.

89
00:03:18,095 --> 00:03:19,695
你好啊 金发小姐
Hello, blondie.

90
00:03:19,696 --> 00:03:22,432
啊哦 我把牛肉弄到你身上了
Oops. I got some meat on you.

91
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:25,101
死牛的肉放在活牛身上 真恶心
Dead cow on live cow. Gross. Heh heh.

92
00:03:25,102 --> 00:03:26,402
哦 天啊
Ohh. God.

93
00:03:26,403 --> 00:03:28,604
呃...你最好还是别说话了 Linda
Uh, not a good time, Linda.

94
00:03:31,223 --> 00:03:32,824
Randy 别拍了 
Randy, stop. Stop filming. You know,

95
00:03:32,825 --> 00:03:34,525
我们不想再出现在什么奶牛纪录片了
We're not gonna be in your cow documentary anymore.

96
00:03:34,526 --> 00:03:36,561
啊哦 你别无选择 Bob 
Well, you don't really have a choice, Bob,

97
00:03:36,562 --> 00:03:39,597
因为我们会坚持为动物伸张正义
'cause I stop at nothing to expose injustice to animals.

98
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:41,199
那个假发是用胶水粘上去的吗
Is that wig glued on

99
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,468
是的 这是--唯一能让假发定型的方法
Yeah. It's-- it's the only way it would stay put.

100
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:44,802
为了拟人化一下
It's to, uh, humanize her.

101
00:03:44,803 --> 00:03:45,837
这真可爱
It's cute.

102
00:03:45,838 --> 00:03:47,005
嗯我见过更可爱的
Mmm. I've seen cuter.

103
00:03:47,006 --> 00:03:48,239
老实说 她只能算上是第4可爱的
Honestly, she's a 4.

104
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,308
Randy 我--我不知道该从何说起
Randy, I--I don't know where to begin.

105
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:52,510
首先 它不是一头母牛
You know, this isn't even a female cow.

106
00:03:52,511 --> 00:03:55,213
牛肉取自犍牛 也就是阉掉的公牛
Beef happens to come from steers, which are male cows.

107
00:03:55,214 --> 00:03:57,548
那么 呃 你怎样解释那个乳房呢
Then, uh, how do you explain that udder

108
00:03:57,549 --> 00:03:58,983
喔 多大的乳房啊
Whoa. What an udder.

109
00:03:58,984 --> 00:04:00,451
离开那里 Tina
 Get away from there, Tina.

110
00:04:00,452 --> 00:04:02,153
那个 呃 那不是乳房
That's, uh, not an udder.

111
00:04:02,154 --> 00:04:03,187
喔 不是吗
Oh, it's not

112
00:04:03,188 --> 00:04:04,989
不要听他的 Randy
Don't listen to him, Randy.

113
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,924
你可以去那给那头牛挤奶
You go ahead and milk that cow.

114
00:04:06,925 --> 00:04:08,326
- 好好挤哦 - 我们已经挤过了
Milk it good. Oh, we did.

115
00:04:08,327 --> 00:04:10,862
你不该这样做 那儿挤不出奶
You shouldn't have. Milk doesn't come out of that.

116
00:04:10,863 --> 00:04:13,398
可是已经挤出来了 就在桶子里
Somethin' came out of it in that bucket over there.

117
00:04:13,399 --> 00:04:14,999
你说的是这个尿桶吗
You mean this bucket of urine

118
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,701
尿 我还是认得的
I know urine, and that's urine.

119
00:04:16,702 --> 00:04:18,269
- Gene 把桶放下 - 不!
- Gene, put that down. - No!

120
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,971
好吧 它当然闻起来像尿 
Well, it certainly smells like urine,

121
00:04:19,972 --> 00:04:21,539
但那可能是因为她生病了
But that's probably because she's sick.

122
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,607
不 她并没有生病
No, she's not sick.

123
00:04:22,608 --> 00:04:24,409
因为你的行为而生病的 Bob!
Sick of your practices, Bob!

124
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,278
既然如此 我现在就去通知动物管理部门
Ok. You know, we're gonna go inside and call animal control,

125
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,946
然后你们将不得不离开
And then you'll have to leave.

126
00:04:30,049 --> 00:04:31,516
你们已经拿到了许可证 
Ok, so you've got all your permits,

127
00:04:31,517 --> 00:04:32,683
允许使用此地吗
And you're renting this storefront

128
00:04:32,684 --> 00:04:34,085
是的 哦 没错
Yes. Oh, yeah.

129
00:04:34,086 --> 00:04:35,553
还有 呃 这头牛已经注射过所有的疫苗了吗
And, uh, this cow has had all its shots

130
00:04:35,554 --> 00:04:36,988
是的 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯
Yes. Sure, sure, sure, sure.

131
00:04:36,989 --> 00:04:38,423
很好 我的工作已经完成了
All right. Well, uh, great. My job is done.

132
00:04:38,424 --> 00:04:39,490
再见了
I'll see you guys later.

133
00:04:39,491 --> 00:04:41,092
拜拜 管理员叔叔
Bye. Bye. Bye, animal man.

134
00:04:41,093 --> 00:04:42,126
- 什么 - 喔 你可以在这里签字
What Oh, will you sign

135
00:04:42,127 --> 00:04:43,528
表示同意在此电影出镜吗
A release to be in the movie

136
00:04:43,529 --> 00:04:44,896
喔 拍电影 当然愿意
Uh, yeah. A movie. Yes.

137
00:04:44,897 --> 00:04:46,330
你将会成为一个明星!
You're gonna be a star!

138
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:47,665
- 打扰下- 谢谢
Excuse me. Hello. Thank you.

139
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,434
- 我是那个打你电话的人 - 谢谢你
- The person who called you. - Thank you.

140
00:04:49,435 --> 00:04:52,270
你不能允许把牛放在人行道上 这很危险
You can't have a cow on the sidewalk. It's dangerous.

141
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:55,039
先生 这头牛唯一的危险之处就是
Sir, sir, the only thing dangerous about this cow

142

你认为牛应该被绞碎变成食物吗
Do you think cows should be ground up for food

155
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,501
坦白说 我无所谓的
Personally, I don't really care,

156
00:05:23,502 --> 00:05:26,270
但是我爸喜欢把牛肉碾碎
But my father, he loves grinding them up.

157
00:05:26,271 --> 00:05:28,940
要给他点颜色 让他清醒清醒

158
00:05:28,941 --> 00:05:32,076
爸爸是一个很坏 很坏的人

你知道的 那种震撼人心的音乐

就像是一个微笑符Like an emoticon. 

168
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,870
你认为这头牛向你发出了一个微笑符

还是用屁股发的 真有意思
With its butt. Very interesting.

170
00:06:01,206 --> 00:06:04,208
也许这头牛正试图与我们交流
Maybe this cow is trying to communicate with us

171
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:07,211
这是它知道的唯一方法 就是便便
The only way it knows how, with its feces.

172
00:06:07,212 --> 00:06:08,980
就像原始人一样

就像沙子经过沙漏
Like sands through the hourglass,

00:10:39,718 --> 00:10:42,553
这是我做过的最棒的梦!
This is the best dream I've ever had!

281
00:10:42,554 --> 00:10:44,922
人人都在地板上尿尿吧!
Everybody pee on the floor!

282
00:10:44,923 --> 00:10:48,158
谁要加入!
Who's with me!

283
00:10:48,888 --> 00:10:50,689
好啦 趁热赶紧吃吧
Ok, eat while it's hot.

284
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:53,492
喔 喔 喔 看看谁把麦片泡这么好
Well, well, well. Look who's too good for cereal now.

285
00:10:53,493 --> 00:10:55,527
他想讨好那头牛
He's trying to impress the cow.

286
00:10:55,528 --> 00:10:56,895
别瞎说
Don't be ridiculous.

287
00:10:56,896 --> 00:10:58,630
居然有人会清理
Someone knows how to treat

288
00:10:58,631 --> 00:11:00,065
一头性别不明的牛的尿
A lady-slash- male steer.

289
00:11:00,066 --> 00:11:03,068
Bob 这种情况我觉得不舒服
Bob, I am not comfortable with this situation.

290
00:11:03,069 --> 00:11:04,603
Lin 我有什么办法
Lin, what was I supposed to do

291
00:11:04,604 --> 00:11:06,138
我做了个疯狂的梦 昨晚下雨的时候
I had that crazy dream. It was raining.

292
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:07,973
我的梦才疯狂
Well, I had a crazy dream

293
00:11:07,974 --> 00:11:10,509
梦里没有什么牛pi-gu
That there wouldn't be a cow's a-s-s

294
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:13,145
在我吃早饭的时候对着我
In my face when I'm eating my breakfast.

295
00:11:13,146 --> 00:11:14,880
我知道那个拼出来是什么单词
I know what that spells.

296
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:16,081
- 屁股 - 屁股
- Ass. - Ass.

297
00:11:16,082 --> 00:11:17,082
妈妈
Mom.

298
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,083
- 是屁股 - 别再说了
- Ass. - Stop it.

299
00:11:18,084 --> 00:11:18,984
说再见吧 各位
Say good-bye, everybody.

300
00:11:18,985 --> 00:11:20,652
它要出去了
It's going out

301
00:11:20,653 --> 00:11:22,654
到它该去的大街上去
On the street, where it belongs.

302
00:11:22,655 --> 00:11:24,256
当然当然
Of course, ok Of course.

303
00:11:24,257 --> 00:11:25,223
早饭过后我就把它牵到大街上去
Right after breakfast.

304
00:11:25,224 --> 00:11:27,859
但牛是不会下楼梯的
Cows can't go down stairs.

305
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,995
- - 什么 - 什么意思
- What - What's that

306
00:11:29,996 --> 00:11:31,663
牛是不会下楼梯的
Cows can't go down stairs.

307
00:11:31,664 --> 00:11:32,898
大家都这么说
That's, like, a thing.

308
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:33,899
我听说过
I've heard that.

309
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,134
这就像一个有趣的事实
It's like a fun fact.

310
00:11:36,135 --> 00:11:37,269
Bobby. Bobby
Bobby... Bobby...

311
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,104
难道牛不会下楼梯吗
Cows can't go down stairs

312
00:11:39,105 --> 00:11:41,072
别告诉我这是真的
That better not be true.

313
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,744
你们怎么看
What do you know

314
00:11:45,745 --> 00:11:48,180
我们就看见你推了半个小时牛屁股
We know you'll push on a cow's butt

315
00:11:48,181 --> 00:11:50,649
并且没有求助
For half an hour without asking for help.

316
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,884
你打算一个人处理吗
Gotta have that butt all to yourself.

317
00:11:52,885 --> 00:11:56,121
嘿 Bob! 发生什么事了 伙计
 Hey, Bob! What's the deal, man

318
00:11:56,122 --> 00:11:57,823
你对Moolissa做了些什么
What'd you do to Moolissa

319
00:11:57,824 --> 00:11:59,891
它在上面 过来把它弄出去!
It's up here! Come get it out!

320
00:11:59,892 --> 00:12:02,094
Linda, 它不再这里 Randy.
Linda. Uh, it's not up here, Randy.

321
00:12:02,095 --> 00:12:03,261
我的老婆疯了
My wife's crazy. 

322
00:12:03,262 --> 00:12:05,263
如果他知道我把那头牛弄进来了 
If he knows I brought the cow in,

323
00:12:05,264 --> 00:12:06,331
他会认为他赢了
He'll think he won.

324
00:12:06,332 --> 00:12:07,766
他赢了又怎样
So what if he won

325
00:12:07,767 --> 00:12:09,768
你立刻把牛弄出去
Get the cow out of the house now.

326
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:11,837
- 不要说了 - 你赶快把牛弄出去
- Stop. - You get it out of the house.

327
00:12:11,838 --> 00:12:13,271
- 我正在努力-- - 把它弄出去

328
00:12:13,272 --> 00:12:14,840
喔呃 这头牛啊
Oh. Uh, this cow.

329
00:12:14,841 --> 00:12:16,941
这头牛 是的 它确实在这里
This cow, yeah, is here.

330
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,377
爸爸 我弄了泡泡浴
Dad, I ran that bubble bath

331
00:12:19,378 --> 00:12:21,346
给你和Moolissa的 正如你所愿

334

只剩下2天了
2 days left.

335
00:12:26,786 --> 00:12:30,055
只剩2天来决定是把这头牛送去屠宰场
2 days to decide to send that cow to slaughter

336
00:12:30,056 --> 00:12:33,959
还是承认你是一个伪君子和凶手
Or admit you're a hypocrite and a murderer.

337
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,027
哇 多棒的电影啊
Wow. What a movie.

338

马是我最喜欢的动物

373
00:13:54,907 --> 00:13:56,975
我们还是就此打住吧
You know what Let's just stop

374
00:13:56,976 --> 00:13:59,244
省的说出要反悔的话
Before we both say something we'll regret,

375
00:13:59,245 --> 00:14:01,446
例如马比牛要好之类的
Like that horses are better than cows.

376
00:14:01,447 --> 00:14:02,347
我现在后悔了
I regret that.

377
00:14:02,348 --> 00:14:03,915
不过马确实比牛好
But it's true.

378
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,254
牛去哪了
Where's the cow

379
00:14:09,255 --> 00:14:11,756
你是不是想问 小阉牛哪去了
I believe you mean, "where's the steer "

380
00:14:11,757 --> 00:14:13,825

哈! 牛可以下楼梯
Ha! Cows can go down stairs.

385
00:14:19,432 --> 00:14:21,933
你需要的东西是4个羊毛袜子 
All you need is 4 wool socks,

386
00:14:21,934 --> 00:14:24,836
一个床垫 以及一个意念
A mattress, and the will to make it happen.

387
00:14:24,837 --> 00:14:26,037
你居然…

388
00:14:26,038 --> 00:14:29,507
你的女朋友已经被绑在外面了
Your girlfriend is tied up outside.

389
00:14:31,878 --> 00:14:34,312
不--!

00:14:34,313 --> 00:14:36,147
爸爸怎么了
What's wrong with dad

391
00:14:36,148 --> 00:14:38,483
我觉得他是讨厌绳子
I think he hates leashes.

392
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,221
这不是我的错 Randy
It's not my fault, Randy.

393
00:14:43,222 --> 00:14:44,923
她被人偷了 这不能怪谁
She was stolen. I mean, it's no one's fault.

394
00:14:44,924 --> 00:14:45,991
除了Linda 
Except for Linda's.

395
00:14:45,992 --> 00:14:47,659
我必须这么做
I did what I had to do

396
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,294
为了保护我的家人和地毯
To protect my family and my carpet.

397
00:14:49,295 --> 00:14:51,463
随你怎么说 那到底是谁
Yeah, whatever. So who do we know

398
00:14:51,464 --> 00:14:54,332
会偷一头带着金色假发的牛
That would steal a cow in a blonde wig

399
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,401
一定是怪胎 呵呵
Maybe some perverts. Heh heh.

400
00:14:56,402 --> 00:14:58,370
昨晚我们吵了一架 我和Moolissa
We had a fight last night, me and Moolissa.

401
00:14:58,371 --> 00:15:00,972
真希望我们能回到从前
I just wish I had a chance to make things right again.

402
00:15:00,973 --> 00:15:04,376
如果你知道了便便的真相 就不会这么想了
You wouldn't if you heard some of the things she was pooping about you.

403
00:15:04,377 --> 00:15:05,377

你们就这样一天到晚
You fellas just leave her tied up

407
00:15:11,484 --> 00:15:12,851
把她绑在这里吗
Here at night all alone

408
00:15:12,852 --> 00:15:14,886
喔 是的 是的她不会介意的
Oh, yeah, yeah. She doesn't mind.

409
00:15:14,887 --> 00:15:18,557

We could just back a trailer right up here, honey, huh

410
00:15:18,558 --> 00:15:20,826

Come on. Let's go get her.

419
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:47,752
我们应该在天黑之后再过来
We should come back after dark.

420
00:15:47,753 --> 00:15:49,020
为什么 因为这更富有戏剧性
Why It's more dramatic.

421
00:15:49,021 --> 00:15:51,456
- 这真是愚蠢 - 不…
- That is stupid. - No. No, no, no.

422
00:15:51,457 --> 00:15:53,825
太令人期待了 大拯救行动
I can see it now, the big rescue.

423
00:15:53,826 --> 00:15:56,328
我们将用红外摄像把整个过程拍下来
We'll shoot the whole thing in infrared.

424
00:15:56,329 --> 00:15:58,963
喔 Randy 不要--什么 用红外线摄像
Oh, Randy, com-- in infrared

425
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,833
这真蠢
This is nuts.

426
00:16:01,834 --> 00:16:04,035
孩子们现在应该在床上的 Bob
The kids should be in bed, Bob.

427
00:16:04,036 --> 00:16:06,070
这可是红外摄像机 Lin 给她看看
It's infrared, lin. Show her.

428
00:16:09,408 --> 00:16:10,809
你干嘛要发出这样的声音
Why are you doing that

429
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:11,877
我这是在发暗号
I'm signaling.

430
00:16:11,878 --> 00:16:13,545
各位 迂回前进
Everybody, serpentine.

431
00:16:13,546 --> 00:16:15,847
太棒了!我们像支特警队!
 Yes! We're a unit.

432
00:16:16,415 --> 00:16:18,517
爸爸 你要记住
Dad, you should know

433
00:16:18,518 --> 00:16:19,601
不管发生什么 
If anything happens,

434
00:16:19,602 --> 00:16:22,270
我们随时准备进攻
I am in full attack mode right now.

435
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,356
我也是 我极度渴望鲜血
Me, too. I'm hungry for blood.

436
00:16:24,357 --> 00:16:25,941
还有糖果
And also candy.

437
00:16:25,942 --> 00:16:27,592
喔 谢谢 孩子们
Uh, thanks, kids.

438
00:16:27,593 --> 00:16:30,595
糟糕 我忘了起立的信号
Damn it. I missed the signal to stand up.

439
00:16:30,596 --> 00:16:31,630
不好意思 各位
Sorry, everybody.

440
00:16:31,631 --> 00:16:33,298
你让我们小队丢脸了
You let down the unit.

441
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:34,566
我说了对不起了
I said I'm sorry.

442
00:16:34,567 --> 00:16:37,369
Bob 我们现在该做什么
Bob, we're here. What do we do now

443
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:40,005
我们 呃 呃 打开门
We, uh, uh, open the gate.

444
00:16:40,006 --> 00:16:41,339
这不难
That was easy.

445
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,441
你们在干什么
What do you think you're doing

446
00:16:43,442 --> 00:16:44,909
Gene 进攻!
 Gene, attack!

447
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:48,880
喔! 小屁孩居然咬我的腿!
Ow! Your children are biting my legs!

448
00:16:48,881 --> 00:16:51,182
Randy 去牵Moolissa 我们行动
 Randy, get Moolissa. Let's move.

449
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,787
击个掌 Bob 我们成功了
High-five, Bob. We did it.

450
00:16:55,788 --> 00:16:57,756
干得好 Randy.
High-five, Randy. Nice job.

451
00:16:57,757 --> 00:17:01,793
要不是孩子们拖住那女人 我们成不了
I mean, we couldn't have done it without the kids biting that woman.

452
00:17:01,794 --> 00:17:04,062
她满身木屑和山羊味
She tasted like sawdust and goats.

453
00:17:04,063 --> 00:17:07,332
3, 2, 1.
3,2,1

454
00:17:10,102 --> 00:17:12,470
Bob 生命倒计时器结束了
Bob, the cow-ntdown's over.

455
00:17:12,471 --> 00:17:15,140
是时候决定Moolissa的命运了
It's time to decide Moolissa's fate.

456
00:17:15,141 --> 00:17:16,675
认真的吗
Seriously Right now

457
00:17:16,676 --> 00:17:17,976
我们刚刚才救了她
We just rescued her.

458
00:17:17,977 --> 00:17:19,711
她该被送去屠宰场了 Bob
She's due at the slaughterhouse, Bob.

459
00:17:19,712 --> 00:17:20,879
你的决定是什么
What's it gonna be

460
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,880
凶手!
Murderer!

461
00:17:21,881 --> 00:17:23,648
Louise 闭嘴
Louise, shush.

462
00:17:23,649 --> 00:17:25,917
Randy 能暂停拍摄你那愚蠢的电影一分钟吗
Randy, can you stop making your stupid movie for one minute

463
00:17:25,918 --> 00:17:27,686
然后做个正常人
And just be a human being

464
00:17:27,687 --> 00:17:30,021
什么 Bob难道你就不能暂停做你那愚蠢的汉堡
I don't know, Bob. Can you stop making your stupid burgers

465
00:17:30,022 --> 00:17:31,723
1分钟 然后做个正常人吗
For one minute and be a human being

466
00:17:31,724 --> 00:17:33,024
你是想让感到内疚吗
So now you're gonna guilt-trip me

467
00:17:33,025 --> 00:17:34,726
这正是这部电影的目标
That's what the whole movie is about.

468
00:17:34,727 --> 00:17:35,827
我还以为我们现在是朋友了,Randy
I thought we were friends now, Randy,

469
00:17:35,828 --> 00:17:38,029
因为我们一起救了那头牛!
'cause we saved the cow together!

470
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,731
也许像我这样激进的纪录片制作人
Maybe activists- slash-documentarians

471
00:17:39,732 --> 00:17:41,666
本来就不能拥有朋友 不管你救了多少牛!
Can't have friends, no matter how many cows they save!

472
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:43,935
好吧 这真令人伤心 Randy!
Well, that's just sad, Randy!

473
00:17:43,936 --> 00:17:45,687
我知道!
I know!

474
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:48,473
喔 天啊 差一点就撞上了
Oh, my God. That was close.

475
00:17:48,474 --> 00:17:50,875
我不知道我会做什么 如果
I don't know what I would do if anything

476
00:17:50,876 --> 00:17:52,510
它发生不测…
Happened to moo--

477
00:17:52,511 --> 00:17:54,412
啊 我没有撞到她!
Ahh. I didn't hit her! 

478
00:17:54,413 --> 00:17:56,047
我没有撞到她! 我--我刹车了!
I didn't hit her! I--I stopped!

479
00:17:56,048 --> 00:17:57,682
她应该没事
She's probably fine.

480
00:17:57,683 --> 00:18:00,118
她死了 刚才肯定心脏病突发了
She's dead. She must have had a cow heart attack.

481
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:01,620
- 不 - 听着
- No. - You know what

482
00:18:01,621 --> 00:18:03,989
我现在要拿点东西
Let me get something out of my van real quick.

483
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,256
马上回来
Be right back.

484
00:18:07,026 --> 00:18:08,526
Moolissa!
Moolissa!

485
00:18:08,527 --> 00:18:09,728
喔 我的天啊 不
Oh, my God, no.

486
00:18:09,729 --> 00:18:11,463
你不要再我面前死去
Don't you die on me.

487
00:18:11,464 --> 00:18:13,598
你不要死啊 说话啊!
Don't you die. Say something!

488
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:16,735
Louise 看啊 这是一个心 
Louise, look. It's a heart,

489
00:18:16,736 --> 00:18:17,969
一个心型的便便
A heart-shaped poop.

490
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,472
怎么回事 不是我弄的啊
What the hell I didn't do that.

491
00:18:20,473 --> 00:18:21,856
我要把它保留下来
I'm keeping it.

492
00:18:21,857 --> 00:18:24,209
Bob 没事吧
Bob, you all right

493
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,177
你的脸色有一些苍白
You look a little pale.

494
00:18:30,016 --> 00:18:31,082
我们死了吗
Are we dead

495
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,151
我死了 Bob你只是晕过去了
I'm dead, Bob. You just fainted.

496
00:18:33,152 --> 00:18:34,386
我晕过去了 哇
I fainted Wow.

497
00:18:34,387 --> 00:18:35,820
- 这真是令人尴尬啊 - 好吧
- That's embarrassing. - Ok.

498
00:18:35,821 --> 00:18:37,422
我--我不是容易晕的人
I'm--I'm not a fainter.

499
00:18:37,423 --> 00:18:39,557
- 是啊我--我已经死了- 是啊
Yeah. I'm--I'm dead. Right. Yeah.

500
00:18:39,558 --> 00:18:42,160
但是听着 我想让你帮我做些事情
But listen. There's something I want you to do for me.

501
00:18:42,161 --> 00:18:44,029
用我的肉做汉堡包
Make burgers out of me.

502
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,031
什么! 不当然不行
What! No. No way.

503
00:18:46,032 --> 00:18:47,032
当然可以 Bob
Yes way, Bob.

504
00:18:47,033 --> 00:18:48,800
听着 自从我见到你之后 
Look, ever since I met you,

505
00:18:48,801 --> 00:18:51,202
做汉堡就让我觉得自己是个大坏蛋
Making burgers makes me feel like a horrible person.

506
00:18:51,203 --> 00:18:52,937
Bob 我是一个阉割过的公牛
Bob, I'm a castrated steer.

507
00:18:52,938 --> 00:18:54,973
是啊 我是一个已经结婚了的男人
Yeah, I'm a married man.

508
00:18:56,642 --> 00:18:57,909
好吧真是有点幼稚--
Yeah, I'm kid--

509
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,044
咱俩都一样 对吧
Same thing, right

510
00:18:59,045 --> 00:19:00,779
没错 听着
Yeah. Think about it, though.

511
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,464
虽然我是一头牛 你知道的
I'm a cow, you know

512
00:19:02,465 --> 00:19:04,916
不是野马 也不是座头鲸 
We're not wild stallions or humpback whales,

513
00:19:04,917 --> 00:19:06,885
但是我们也希望自己很特别
But we wanna feel special, too.

514
00:19:06,886 --> 00:19:07,986
起码我是这样希望的
I do, anyway.

515
00:19:07,987 --> 00:19:09,921
是你让我变得与众不同
You turn me into something amazing.

516
00:19:09,922 --> 00:19:11,523
慢着 难道这不是我的潜意识
Wait. Isn't this my subconscious

517
00:19:11,524 --> 00:19:13,258
正在告诉我一些我想要听到的话?
Telling me what I want to hear

518
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:14,592
嘿 不是的
Hey, no.

519
00:19:14,593 --> 00:19:16,494
实际上确实是在你的潜意识里
You know what Yes, it is, actually.

520
00:19:16,495 --> 00:19:17,929
看来真有潜意识继续说吧
Well, it's working. Keep talking.

521
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,164
吻我
Kiss me.

522
00:19:19,165 --> 00:19:22,033
不 我做不出来
No. I can't do that.

523
00:19:22,034 --> 00:19:23,868
你可以的 而且你也想这么做
You can, and you want to.

524
00:19:23,869 --> 00:19:25,303
好吧
ok.

525
00:19:25,304 --> 00:19:28,473
就一下 很快的一下 因为这是我欠你的
One quick one because I owe you.

526
00:19:28,474 --> 00:19:30,542
哦 还是算了吧 也许我-- 我们不应该这么做
Uh, maybe not. Maybe I--we shouldn't.

527
00:19:30,543 --> 00:19:32,577
喔 我们应该这么做 完全应该
Oh, we should, absolutely.

528
00:19:32,578 --> 00:19:34,979
喔 我的天啊 我到底在干什么
Oh, my God. What am I doing

529
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,164
你在干什么呢
What are you doing

530
00:19:36,165 --> 00:19:38,249
我正要去吻一头牛
I'm about to kiss a cow.

531
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,418
没错
Yeah.

532
00:19:42,088 --> 00:19:43,154
Bobby 你还好吗
Bobby, are you ok

533
00:19:43,155 --> 00:19:44,923
爸爸的嘴在干什么呢
What's dad doing with his mouth

534
00:19:44,924 --> 00:19:46,591
看起来他好像在亲吻
Looks like he's kissing.

535
00:19:49,295 --> 00:19:50,729
呃 真丢脸
Well, this is awkward.

536
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,731
谁来拿个毯子遮住他
Somebody put a blanket over it.

537
00:19:52,732 --> 00:19:54,632
味道棒极了
Tastes so good.

538
00:19:54,633 --> 00:19:57,001
好的别看了 孩子们都进屋去!马上!
Ok. All right. Kids inside! Now!

539
00:19:57,002 --> 00:19:58,469
哦
Ohh.

540
00:20:00,823 --> 00:20:04,542
在Moolissa出现之前 我会说这只是牛肉
Before Moolissa, I used to say it's just beef.

541
00:20:04,543 --> 00:20:06,844
我大大的错了
I couldn't have been more wrong.

542
00:20:07,813 --> 00:20:09,013
牛是一种鲜活的生命
Cows are living creatures

543
00:20:09,014 --> 00:20:11,649
它们有着美丽的毛发和棕色的眼睛 
With beautiful hair and soft brown eyes,

544
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,985
还有柔软的嘴唇...
Soft mouths...

545
00:20:14,854 --> 00:20:17,222
但同时它们也是牛肉
And also they are beef.

546
00:20:17,223 --> 00:20:19,090
它们是统一的
They're the full package.

547
00:20:20,092 --> 00:20:22,794
说这些是不是有点像伪君子
Does that make me a hypocrite to say that

548
00:20:22,795 --> 00:20:24,362
- 是的 - 不 不是的 Randy
- Yes. - No, it doesn't, Randy.

549
00:20:24,363 --> 00:20:27,966
如果真是伪君子 我也愿意伪一辈子
Or if it does, I can live with that.

550
00:20:27,967 --> 00:20:31,836
下面正式推出我们的第10万个汉堡
I present our 100,000th burger.

551
00:20:32,805 --> 00:20:34,973
第10万个汉堡!
100,000th burger!

552
00:20:34,974 --> 00:20:36,741
真棒!
All right!

553
00:20:36,742 --> 00:20:38,543
好的 展开横幅
Right. Undo the banner.

554
00:20:38,544 --> 00:20:42,280
Bob的汉堡 10万个!真棒!
Bob's burger, 100,000! All right!

555
00:20:42,281 --> 00:20:43,782
哇哦!
Hooray!

556
00:20:43,783 --> 00:20:45,083
把横幅展开
Do the banner.

557
