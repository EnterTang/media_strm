1
00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:07,917
代表时间变异管理局

791
00:00:05,725 --> 00:00:08,017
HUNTER B-15: On behalf of the Time Variance Authority,

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,042
我以侵犯神圣时间线的罪名逮捕你

792
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,142
I hereby arrest you for crimes against the Sacred Timeline.

3
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:13,708
前情提要

4
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:18,875
很久以前 全知全能的 时间守护者出现了

793
00:00:15,183 --> 00:00:18,975
MISS MINUTES: Long ago, the all-knowing Time-Keepers emerged,

5
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:22,708
他们创造了神圣时间线

794
00:00:19,058 --> 00:00:22,808
creating and organizing the Sacred Timeline.

6
00:00:22,792 --> 00:00:25,750
有时 会有像你一样的人偏离常规路径

795
00:00:22,892 --> 00:00:25,850
Sometimes, people like you veer off the path.

7
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:28,500
这些人就是时间犯

796
00:00:25,933 --> 00:00:28,600
We call those Variants.

8
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:35,000
劳菲森 你有何申辩？

797
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:35,100
Laufeyson, how do you plead?

9
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:38,667
-我是莫比乌斯探员 -你在这多长时间了

798
00:00:35,975 --> 00:00:38,767
-I'm Agent Mobius, by the way. -How long have you been here?

10
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,417
我不知道 很难说 时间变异管理局的时间流动不太一样

799
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,517
MOBIUS: I don't know. It's hard to say, time passes differently here in the TVA.

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,125
你们在这里走来走去

800
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,225
Now, you parade about

12
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:47,667
仿佛自己是宇宙中至高无上的仲裁

801
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:47,767
as if you're the divine arbiters of power in the universe.

13
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,208
无限原石？

802
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,308
LOKI: Infinity Stones?

14
00:00:49,292 --> 00:00:51,000
有些人拿来做镇纸

803
00:00:49,392 --> 00:00:51,100
Some of the guys use 'em as paperweights.

15
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:53,042
这里是全宇宙最强大的力量吗？

804
00:00:51,183 --> 00:00:53,142
Is this the greatest power in the universe?

16
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,500
我回不去了 是不是？

805
00:00:55,642 --> 00:00:58,683
LOKI: I can't go back, can I? MOBIUS: I can't offer you salvation,

17
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,583
我不能给你救赎

18
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:01,458
但是也许我可以给你更好的

806
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:01,558
but maybe I can offer you something better.

19
00:01:01,542 --> 00:01:04,333
一个在逃的时间犯在杀害我们的时间卫士

807
00:01:01,642 --> 00:01:04,433
A fugitive Variant's been killing our Minutemen.

20
00:01:04,417 --> 00:01:07,417
你需要诡计之神来帮你制止他？

808
00:01:04,517 --> 00:01:07,517
And you need the God of Mischief to help you stop him?

21
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:10,167
为什么是我？

809
00:01:09,225 --> 00:01:10,267
Why me?

22
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,417
因为我们在追捕的时间犯就是...

810
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,517
MOBIUS: The Variant we're hunting is...

23
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,542
你

811
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,642
You.

24
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,542
威斯康星州 奥什科什

25
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,167
1985年

26
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,958
许个愿

812
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,058
CHILD: Make a wish.

27
00:02:27,667 --> 00:02:29,625
你好 怎么回事？

813
00:02:27,767 --> 00:02:29,725
Hi! What's going on?

28
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:31,042
你们的打扮可不对

814
00:02:29,808 --> 00:02:31,142
You guys aren't dressed right.

29
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:32,833
那么...

815
00:02:31,225 --> 00:02:32,933
I... So...

30
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:34,583
发现时间犯 时间变异管理局

816
00:02:34,558 --> 00:02:36,350
MINUTEMAN: Variant detected, Commander.

31
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:36,250
发现时间犯 指挥官

32
00:02:38,417 --> 00:02:39,750
开始行动

817
00:02:38,517 --> 00:02:39,850
Let's move.

33
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:44,167
这可是我们的要求

818
00:02:41,725 --> 00:02:44,267
Some of us need this, you know.

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,667
还没有关连事件能量 长官

819
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,767
MINUTEMAN: No nexus energy yet, ma'am.

820
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:04,975
HUNTER C-20: It's a trap. Watch your backs!

35
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,875
这是个陷阱 小心背后

36
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:08,167
我的主人 亲爱的女士们 欢迎前来

821
00:03:05,058 --> 00:03:08,267
ANNOUNCER: My lords, my ladies, welcome

37
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,542
欢迎在城堡里加入我们的行列

822
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:11,642
and thank you for joining us, here at the castle.

38
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:16,500
请在座位上坐好 一场大战即将开始

823
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:16,600
Please, settle into your seats for a great battle is about to commence.

39
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,667
奖励是什么？我们的公主

824
00:03:16,683 --> 00:03:18,767
The prize? Our princess.

40
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:23,375
究竟是邪恶的一方获胜 还是我们能坚持到英雄降临

825
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:23,475
Will evil prevail, or are we holding out for a hero?

41
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,417
指挥官？

826
00:03:39,183 --> 00:03:40,517
MINUTEMAN: Commander?

827
00:03:50,267 --> 00:03:55,392
Where have all the good men gone And where are all the Gods?

828
00:03:55,892 --> 00:03:58,808
Where's the streetwise Hercules to fight...

42
00:03:58,792 --> 00:04:00,083
你在干什么？

829
00:03:58,892 --> 00:04:00,183
What are you doing?

43
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:01,583
这样才好玩

830
00:04:00,267 --> 00:04:01,683
Having some fun.

831
00:04:03,308 --> 00:04:08,225
Isn't there a white knight Upon a fiery steed?

832
00:04:09,392 --> 00:04:14,892
Late at night, I toss and I turn And I dream of what I need

833
00:04:14,975 --> 00:04:17,183
I need a hero

834
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:20,683
I'm holding out for a hero Till the end of the night

835
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,225
He's gotta be strong And he's gotta be fast

836
00:04:24,308 --> 00:04:27,517
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight

837
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,350
I need a hero

838
00:04:30,058 --> 00:04:34,142
I'm holding out for a hero 'Till the morning light

44
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,167
运行程序 - 时间门

839
00:04:34,225 --> 00:04:37,225
He's gotta be sure and it's gotta be soon

840
00:04:37,308 --> 00:04:40,517
And he's gotta be larger than life

841
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,933
I need a hero!

45
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,250
力量 性能 质量

842
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:10,642
MISS MINUTES: Okay, y'all, let's review what we've learned.

46
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,542
好的 各位 让我们来回顾一下咱们学到的

47
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:13,667
当关连事件分支超出红线时 会发生什么？

843
00:05:10,725 --> 00:05:13,767
What happens when a nexus event branches past red line?

48
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,250
非常糟糕的事情

844
00:05:14,808 --> 00:05:16,350
Very bad things.

49
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,667
正经点 洛基 是什么？

845
00:05:16,433 --> 00:05:18,767
Come on, Loki. What is it?

846
00:05:18,892 --> 00:05:23,308
It's when the TVA can no longer reset a nexus event.

50
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:23,208
时间变异管理局将无法 重置关连事件

51
00:05:23,292 --> 00:05:25,208
行了吗？太无聊了

847
00:05:23,392 --> 00:05:25,308
Okay? Boring.

52
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:28,500
没错 而且那会导致时间线的毁灭

848
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:28,600
Right. And that would lead to the destruction of the timeline

53
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:31,208
还有我们所知的现实的崩溃

849
00:05:28,683 --> 00:05:31,308
and the collapse of reality as we know it.

54
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:32,292
你能听到我说话吗？

850
00:05:31,392 --> 00:05:32,392
Can you hear me?

55
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:34,708
你是录制好的 还是有生命的？

851
00:05:33,017 --> 00:05:34,808
Are you a recording? Or are you alive?

852
00:05:34,892 --> 00:05:37,100
Uh, sorta both.

56
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,000
两者都是吧

853
00:05:37,183 --> 00:05:38,183
Ah.

854
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:42,433
Watch it! Where's your manners?

57
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,333
注意点 懂不懂礼貌？

855
00:05:43,058 --> 00:05:44,975
Oh! Hey! Quit it!

58
00:05:43,542 --> 00:05:44,875
住手

59
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,167
你这个坏人 混蛋

856
00:05:45,975 --> 00:05:48,267
That is not nice. Jerk.

60
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,125
-别躲 -训练怎么样？

857
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,225
-You can't hide... -MOBIUS: Training goin' well?

61
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:51,708
-挺好的 -那是我的摩托艇杂志吗？

858
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,808
-Yeah. -Is that my jet ski magazine?

62
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:52,917
给我放下 穿上衣服

859
00:05:51,892 --> 00:05:53,017
Put it down. Gear up.

63
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,542
发生袭击了 跟我来

860
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,642
There's been an attack. Let's go.

64
00:05:57,667 --> 00:05:58,792
穿上

861
00:05:57,767 --> 00:05:58,892
Put it on.

65
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:08,083
不错呀 挺帅

862
00:06:05,267 --> 00:06:08,183
Good. Yeah. Smart.

66
00:06:09,042 --> 00:06:10,625
威斯康星州 奥什科什 - 1985年 威胁级别 高

67
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,292
C-20和她的小队一起失联了

863
00:06:10,808 --> 00:06:12,392
C-20 and her team went dark

68
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:15,292
就在他们进入1985年的分支后不久

864
00:06:12,475 --> 00:06:15,392
shortly after they jumped into the 1985 branch.

69
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,292
所有迹象都指向又一次伏击

865
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,392
All signs point to another ambush.

70
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:21,542
我们收集了足够多的现世光环证明 就是时间犯洛基

866
00:06:17,475 --> 00:06:21,642
We've grabbed enough temporal aura to know it's our Loki Variant.

71
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,875
但是是什么类型的洛基 还不得而知

867
00:06:21,725 --> 00:06:23,975
But which kind of Loki, remains unknown.

72
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,000
肯定是更低等的

868
00:06:24,058 --> 00:06:26,100
They're the lesser kind, to be clear.

869
00:06:27,433 --> 00:06:30,100
Let me see the back of that jacket.

73
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,000
给我看看你的衣服背面

74
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,667
时间犯

870
00:06:33,767 --> 00:06:34,767
Hmm.

75
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:40,042
很隐蔽啊 干得好

871
00:06:38,017 --> 00:06:40,142
Very subtle. Well done.

76
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,792
我可不想让大家忘了你的身份

872
00:06:40,225 --> 00:06:42,892
I don't want anybody out there to forget what you are.

77
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,542
你们抓住杀人凶手的救命稻草？

873
00:06:42,975 --> 00:06:44,642
Oh, your only hope of capturing a murderer?

78
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,375
当然不是 你是个巨大的错误

874
00:06:44,725 --> 00:06:46,475
No. A cosmic mistake.

79
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,125
-够了 -谢谢

875
00:06:46,558 --> 00:06:48,225
-That's enough. -Lovely.

80
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,208
咱们说好了

876
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:49,308
MOBIUS: Here's the deal.

81
00:06:49,292 --> 00:06:50,625
当我们进入分支时

877
00:06:49,392 --> 00:06:50,725
When we get out on the branch,

82
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:53,583
我们要找的不只是时间罪犯

878
00:06:50,808 --> 00:06:53,683
we're not just looking for a Time Criminal.

83
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:55,000
还有洛基的踪迹

879
00:06:53,767 --> 00:06:55,100
We're looking for a Loki.

84
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,500
这家伙的变异体

880
00:06:55,183 --> 00:06:57,600
A variation of this guy.

85
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,917
他是我们的老对手

881
00:06:57,683 --> 00:07:00,017
A type we should all be very familiar with,

86
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
因为时间变异管理局 已经裁剪过这家伙很多次了

882
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,100
because the TVA has pruned a lotta these guys,

87
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,083
比其他任何时间犯都要多

883
00:07:03,183 --> 00:07:05,183
almost more than any other Variant.

88
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:06,667
他们各不相同

884
00:07:05,267 --> 00:07:06,767
And no two are alike.

89
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,125
有时外貌差别不大 有时差别挺大

885
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:10,225
Slight differences in appearances, or not so slight.

90
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,708
虽然他们能力不同 但是基本是这几样

886
00:07:10,308 --> 00:07:12,808
Different powers, although, powers, generally include

91
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:15,833
变幻外形 制造幻象 还有我最欣赏的...

887
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:15,933
shape-shifting, illusion-projection, and my favorite...

92
00:07:15,917 --> 00:07:17,833
那是制造分身

888
00:07:16,017 --> 00:07:17,933
Duplication-casting.

93
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,542
是制造幻象

889
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,642
Illusion-projection.

94
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,542
不对 这两个能力完全不同

890
00:07:21,725 --> 00:07:23,642
No, they're two completely different powers.

95
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:24,708
怎么不同了

891
00:07:23,725 --> 00:07:24,808
How?

96
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:28,375
制造幻象是从外部描绘细节图像

892
00:07:24,892 --> 00:07:28,475
Illusion-projection involves depicting a detailed image from outside oneself,

97
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,375
是外部世界能分辨的

893
00:07:28,558 --> 00:07:30,475
which is perceptible in the external world,

98
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,708
而制造分身则需要

894
00:07:30,558 --> 00:07:32,808
whereas duplication-casting entails recreating

99
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:36,250
在现有环境里完全复制整个身体

895
00:07:32,892 --> 00:07:36,350
an exact facsimile of one's own body in its present circumstance,

100
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:39,833
可以说是分子结构的真实镜像

896
00:07:36,433 --> 00:07:39,933
which acts as a true holographic mirror of its molecular structure.

101
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,667
但是这你们都知道了

897
00:07:40,017 --> 00:07:42,767
But you already knew that.

102
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:46,625
好吧 喘口气 我知道了

898
00:07:43,475 --> 00:07:46,725
Okay, take a breath. Noted.

103
00:07:47,292 --> 00:07:51,208
我们要分成两队 我和洛基教授也要去

899
00:07:47,392 --> 00:07:51,308
We're gonna break into two teams, including myself and Professor Loki.

104
00:07:51,292 --> 00:07:52,333
为什么？

900
00:07:51,392 --> 00:07:52,433
Why?

105
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:57,167
因为不管这个时间犯是谁 我们一直找不到他

901
00:07:53,558 --> 00:07:57,267
Because whoever this Variant is, we haven't been able to find him.

106
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,000
所以这次得专家出场

902
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,100
So let's bring in an expert.

107
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,375
那就是我了

903
00:08:01,225 --> 00:08:02,475
That's me.

108
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,375
-我有武器吗？ -没有

904
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,475
-Do I get a weapon? -Nah.

109
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:08,208
好吧 我又能用魔法了 没人担心吗？

905
00:08:05,558 --> 00:08:08,308
Well, I'll have my magic back. Is no one concerned about that?

110
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:10,167
-担心什么？ -担心我背叛你

906
00:08:08,392 --> 00:08:10,267
-Of what? -Me betraying you.

111
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,458
-没有 -为什么没有？

907
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,558
-No. -Why not?

112
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:12,875
你知道我们总能抓住你

908
00:08:11,642 --> 00:08:12,975
You know that we can catch you.

113
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:16,167
而且背叛我们你还怎么接近时间守护者？

909
00:08:13,058 --> 00:08:16,267
And how's betraying us gonna get you any closer to the Time-Keepers?

114
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,792
我有机会见到时间守护者？

910
00:08:17,308 --> 00:08:19,892
An audience with the Time-Keepers is on the table?

115
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,208
你可以试试

911
00:08:19,975 --> 00:08:21,308
Keep that focus.

116
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,000
已到达关连事件标记峰值 长官

912
00:08:27,725 --> 00:08:30,100
Apex of nexus signature located, ma'am.

117
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,250
我有个问题

913
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,350
Let me ask you this,

118
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,708
为什么我们不能回到攻击发生之前

914
00:08:33,433 --> 00:08:35,808
why don't we just travel back to before the attack,

119
00:08:35,792 --> 00:08:37,333
回到时间犯最初出现的时候？

915
00:08:35,892 --> 00:08:37,433
when the Variant first arrives?

120
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:40,292
关连事件导致时间流不稳定

916
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,392
Nexus events destabilize the time flow.

121
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:44,625
这个分支还在不断变化加剧 所以你只能按照实际时间出现

917
00:08:40,475 --> 00:08:44,725
This branch is still changing and growing, so you gotta show up in real time.

122
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:48,083
该看的训练视频你看了吗？

918
00:08:44,808 --> 00:08:48,183
Did you watch any of the training videos you were supposed to?

123
00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:49,958
我尽可能地忍着看了

919
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:50,058
Well, as many as I could stand.

124
00:08:50,042 --> 00:08:52,000
时间变异管理局的这些宣传材料太无聊了

920
00:08:50,142 --> 00:08:52,100
Your TVA propaganda is exhausting.

125
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,292
那这些是干什么的？

921
00:08:52,183 --> 00:08:53,392
And what do these do?

126
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:58,625
重置器可以裁剪掉分支时间线上受影响的区域

922
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:58,725
Reset charges prune the affected radius of a branched timeline,

127
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:01,500
这样时间就可以自愈

923
00:08:58,808 --> 00:09:01,600
allowing time to heal all its wounds.

128
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,792
说白了就是

924
00:09:01,683 --> 00:09:02,892
Which sounds like a nice way

129
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,292
把周围一切解体 换个好听的说法

925
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,392
of saying disintegrate everything in its vicinity.

130
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,833
他上道了

926
00:09:05,475 --> 00:09:06,933
He's on it.

131
00:09:06,917 --> 00:09:08,375
我可是看了视频的

927
00:09:07,017 --> 00:09:08,475
I watched the videos.

132
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:09,625
多少看了点吧

928
00:09:08,558 --> 00:09:09,725
I mean, some of them.

133
00:09:11,042 --> 00:09:12,792
他开始挟持人质了？

929
00:09:11,142 --> 00:09:12,892
HUNTER B-15: So he's taking hostages now?

134
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,167
这个时间犯从来没有挟持过人质

930
00:09:12,975 --> 00:09:15,267
MOBIUS: The Variant's never taken a hostage before.

135
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,542
也许他开始变本加厉了

931
00:09:16,183 --> 00:09:17,642
HUNTER B-15: Maybe he's upping his game.

136
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,000
要不就是他裁剪了她

932
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:19,100
MINUTEMAN: Or he pruned her.

137
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,042
洛基肯定打不过C-20

933
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,433
HUNTER B-15: A Loki couldn't have gotten the jump on C-20.

138
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,000
其实我觉得你低估了...

934
00:09:21,517 --> 00:09:23,100
I think you underestimate, actually...

139
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,750
散开队形 开始搜寻

935
00:09:23,183 --> 00:09:24,850
Fan out and search for her.

140
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:25,833
加快速度

936
00:09:24,933 --> 00:09:25,933
And hurry up,

141
00:09:25,917 --> 00:09:27,417
我们离红线还差三格

937
00:09:26,017 --> 00:09:27,517
we're at three units until red line.

142
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,375
-开始吧 她说的没错 -来吧

938
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,475
MINUTEMAN: Let's go. She's right. MOBIUS: Come on.

143
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,250
等等

939
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,350
Wait...

144
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,125
你们要是离开这个帐篷 就会和他们下场一样

940
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:39,225
If you leave this tent, you'll end up like them.

145
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,125
你发现什么了？

941
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:44,225
What do you see?

146
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:47,625
我发现了一个阴谋

942
00:09:46,475 --> 00:09:47,725
I see a scheme,

147
00:09:49,042 --> 00:09:51,167
在那个阴谋里 我发现了我自己

943
00:09:49,142 --> 00:09:51,267
and in that scheme, I see myself.

148
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,667
阿斯加德有句谚语

944
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,767
We have a saying in Asgard,

149
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:02,542
狼耳所现之处 狼牙伺机而动

945
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:02,642
"Where there are wolf's ears, wolf's teeth are near."

150
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:05,167
意思是你要时刻警惕周围的环境

946
00:10:03,267 --> 00:10:05,267
It means to be aware of your surroundings.

151
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:09,125
这其实很荒谬 因为我们族人天生就是 上当受骗的笨蛋

947
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:09,225
Which is absurd, because my people are, by nature, gullible fools.

152
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,833
我作为诡计之神

948
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:10,933
A trait that I, the God of Mischief,

153
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:13,625
一次又一次地利用他们的这个弱点 一听就知道

949
00:10:11,017 --> 00:10:13,725
exploited time and time again simply by listening.

154
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:17,167
我的牙齿很锐利 但是我的耳朵更加锐利

950
00:10:13,808 --> 00:10:17,267
My teeth were sharp, but my ears even sharper.

155
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,458
我们没有时间了 莫比乌斯

951
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,558
We're running out of time, Mobius.

156
00:10:19,542 --> 00:10:21,042
等等 给他一个机会

952
00:10:19,642 --> 00:10:21,142
Hold it. Just give him a chance.

157
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,042
你让我想起了他们

953
00:10:21,225 --> 00:10:23,142
LOKI: You remind me of them.

158
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:27,583
时间变异管理局和阿斯加德的众神 是一路货色

954
00:10:23,225 --> 00:10:27,683
The Time Variance Authority and the gods of Asgard, one and the same.

159
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:30,042
醉心于权力 却无视真相

955
00:10:27,767 --> 00:10:30,142
Drunk with power, blinded to the truth.

160
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,500
那些你低估的人会吞噬你

956
00:10:30,225 --> 00:10:32,600
Those you underestimate will devour you.

161
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,000
你低估我

957
00:10:32,683 --> 00:10:34,100
You underestimate me,

162
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:37,042
就像你低估这个低等洛基一样

958
00:10:34,183 --> 00:10:37,142
just as you underestimate this lesser Loki.

163
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:40,083
这就是为什么你们一次又一次地 自投罗网

959
00:10:37,225 --> 00:10:40,183
Which is why, you walk into one wolf's mouth after another.

164
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:42,917
只剩两格了 他这是浪费时间

960
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:43,017
--Two units. He is wasting our time.

165
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,917
好吧 快点 洛基 长话短说

961
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,017
Okay. Come on, Loki, make a long story short.

166
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,458
我们得找到C-20

962
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,517
HUNTER B-15: We need to look for C-20.

167
00:10:46,542 --> 00:10:49,333
这就是时间犯的目的

963
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,433
That's exactly what the Variant wants you to do.

168
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,917
这是个圈套 他就在帐篷外边等着你

964
00:10:50,558 --> 00:10:53,017
It's a trap. He's waiting for you outside this tent.

169
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,458
我要收回重置器吗？

965
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,558
Should I secure the reset charges?

170
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:56,667
不用 他要找的是我 我是他计划的关键

966
00:10:54,642 --> 00:10:56,767
No. He wants me. I'm the key to his plan.

171
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,958
-他知道我更强大 -就快剩一格了

967
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,058
-He knows that I'm stronger. -Almost one unit.

172
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:02,292
而且他非常确定 我们一起 可以推翻并且掌管时间变异管理局

968
00:10:59,142 --> 00:11:02,392
And he rightly believes that together we can overthrow and rule the TVA.

173
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:05,167
但是那不是我想要的 我有了一个新的目标

969
00:11:02,475 --> 00:11:05,267
But that's not what I want. I have a new purpose.

174
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,792
我是神圣时间线的奴仆

970
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,892
I'm a servant of the Sacred Timeline.

175
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,792
我现在知道了他的策略

971
00:11:07,975 --> 00:11:10,892
And knowing what I now know about his tactics,

176
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,083
我可以把这个时间犯抓回来

972
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:13,183
I can deliver you the Variant,

177
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,542
但是我需要保证

973
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,642
but I need assurances.

178
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,625
什么保证？

974
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,725
Yeah?

179
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,042
保证任务完成的那一刻

975
00:11:19,808 --> 00:11:22,142
Assurances that I won't be completely disintegrated

180
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,083
我不会被完全解体

976
00:11:22,225 --> 00:11:24,183
the moment the job has been done.

181
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:25,375
好啊

977
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:25,475
Right...

182
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,583
咱们得立刻去见时间守护者

978
00:11:26,475 --> 00:11:28,683
We'll need to speak to the Time-Keepers at once.

183
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:31,125
他们所处的危险远超想象

979
00:11:28,767 --> 00:11:31,225
They're in graver danger than we realized.

184
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,583
他在说谎 逗我们玩呢

980
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,683
He's lying. Just playing games.

185
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:39,917
外面根本没人

981
00:11:38,767 --> 00:11:40,017
There's no one out there.

186
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:42,333
重置时间线

982
00:11:41,017 --> 00:11:42,433
HUNTER B-15: Reset the timeline.

187
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,250
我差点就信了

983
00:11:44,558 --> 00:11:46,350
You had me for a second.

188
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,792
我的耳朵也很锐利

984
00:11:46,433 --> 00:11:47,892
My ears are sharp too.

189
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:20,542
时间线重置

190
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:23,750
追捕者C-20 失踪

191
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:41,167
是我的错觉吗 还是这个办公室 变得越来越豪华了？

985
00:12:37,933 --> 00:12:41,267
MOBIUS: Is it just me, or does this office keep getting better and better?

192
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:44,917
那个是从哪弄来的 那个下雪水晶球？

986
00:12:42,767 --> 00:12:45,017
Where'd you get that one, the snow globe?

193
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,042
这些真不错

987
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,142
I love those.

194
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,333
我不记得带回来过那个盒子

988
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:48,433
I don't remember bringing back that case.

195
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:50,708
为我工作的分析师又不止你一个

989
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,808
You're not the only analyst working for me.

196
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,333
但是我是不是你最喜欢的那个？

990
00:12:51,933 --> 00:12:54,433
But, would you say, maybe, I'm your favorite one?

197
00:12:55,292 --> 00:12:58,333
为什么你要把我的战利品都拿走？

991
00:12:55,392 --> 00:12:58,433
And why do you get to keep all the trophies from my cases in here?

198
00:12:58,417 --> 00:13:00,625
你不知道我喜欢用那个溜冰鞋

992
00:12:58,517 --> 00:13:00,725
You don't think I'd love having that roller skate

199
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,417
来美化我的书架吗？

993
00:13:00,808 --> 00:13:02,517
there sprucing up my cubicle?

200
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,375
因为那些行动是我负责的

994
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,475
Because I approve the missions.

201
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:06,208
说得没错

995
00:13:05,267 --> 00:13:06,308
Good point.

202
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:09,625
正好 咱们聊聊你刚刚搞砸的那个行动吧

996
00:13:06,392 --> 00:13:09,725
Speaking of which, let's talk about the one you just botched.

203
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,708
咱们聊天可少不了这个

997
00:13:10,933 --> 00:13:12,808
You might need this for our discussion.

204
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,250
再多点就更好了

998
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,350
I hope it's a double.

205
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:21,292
这个时间犯是 我行我素 冥顽不化 难以预料

999
00:13:14,433 --> 00:13:21,392
This Variant is... "Insubordinate, stubborn, unpredictable."

206
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,125
听上去和某人一样

1000
00:13:21,475 --> 00:13:23,225
Sounds like someone else I know.

207
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,750
我也觉得和某人很像

1001
00:13:23,308 --> 00:13:25,850
I was just thinking it sounds like someone I know.

208
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,042
-莫比乌斯？ -怎么？

1002
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,142
-Mobius? -What?

209
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,542
那些水印原来就有

1003
00:13:30,808 --> 00:13:32,642
Those rings were already there.

210
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,333
都是你弄的

1004
00:13:32,725 --> 00:13:34,433
And they're all from you.

211
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:37,417
没准是另一个你喜欢的分析师弄的

1005
00:13:34,517 --> 00:13:37,517
Maybe it's from your other favorite analyst.

212
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,458
听着 拉芙娜 我很抱歉

1006
00:13:38,933 --> 00:13:40,558
Listen, Ravonna, I'm sorry.

213
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:42,958
我知道我对待

1007
00:13:40,642 --> 00:13:43,058
I realize that my, you know,

214
00:13:43,042 --> 00:13:45,583
这个洛基的方式有争议 但是...

1008
00:13:43,142 --> 00:13:45,683
methods with this Loki are controversial, but...

215
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:48,958
把一个危险的时间犯带去行动是有争议的

1009
00:13:45,767 --> 00:13:49,058
Towing a dangerous Variant into the field is controversial.

216
00:13:49,042 --> 00:13:51,583
对 今天就并非完全如我所愿

1010
00:13:49,142 --> 00:13:51,683
Yeah, it didn't go exactly the way I wanted it to today,

217
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:53,292
但是我们发现了一点

1011
00:13:51,767 --> 00:13:53,392
but here's what we did find out.

218
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,208
这个时间犯喜欢拖延时间

1012
00:13:53,475 --> 00:13:55,308
The Variant likes to stall for time,

219
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:58,083
最终我们肯定会抓住另一个 有同样习惯的人

1013
00:13:55,392 --> 00:13:58,183
and, eventually, we'll catch the other one doing the same thing.

220
00:13:58,167 --> 00:14:00,708
因为了解这个洛基能够帮助我接近

1014
00:13:58,267 --> 00:14:00,808
Because understanding this Loki helps me get closer

221
00:14:00,792 --> 00:14:02,625
我们正在追捕的那个 不是吗？

1015
00:14:00,892 --> 00:14:02,725
to the one we're chasing. Right?

222
00:14:03,417 --> 00:14:06,583
我知道你是个心慈手软的人

1016
00:14:03,517 --> 00:14:06,683
Look, I know you have a soft spot for broken things.

223
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:08,208
-我不这么觉得 -你就是这样

1017
00:14:06,767 --> 00:14:08,308
-I don't think so. -Yes, you do.

224
00:14:08,292 --> 00:14:11,250
但是洛基就是个邪恶的 满嘴谎言的祸害

1018
00:14:08,392 --> 00:14:11,350
But Loki is an evil, lying scourge.

225
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,792
他在神圣时间线上就是这种货色

1019
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,892
That is the part he plays on the Sacred Timeline.

226
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,417
也许他想改头换面呢

1020
00:14:13,975 --> 00:14:15,517
Maybe he wants to mix it up.

227
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,625
有时你也会厌倦一成不变的

1021
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,725
Sometimes you get tired of playing the same part.

228
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,833
这有可能吗？他能改变吗？

1022
00:14:17,808 --> 00:14:19,933
Is that possible? He can change?

229
00:14:19,917 --> 00:14:21,917
除非时间守护者裁决 否则不可能

1023
00:14:20,017 --> 00:14:22,017
Not unless the Time-Keepers decree it.

230
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,000
到那个时候 该怎么样就怎么样

1024
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,100
And then, it shall be so.

231
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,083
时间守护者那边怎么样？

1025
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:27,975
- And how are the old Time-Keepers? -

232
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,000
你觉得呢？

1026
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,100
How do you think?

233
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,250
我不知道 因为我从来没见过他们

1027
00:14:30,183 --> 00:14:32,350
I don't know. 'Cause I've never met 'em.

234
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,208
谢天谢地 虽然我不该这么说

1028
00:14:32,433 --> 00:14:34,308
Thankfully. Although, I shouldn't say that.

235
00:14:34,292 --> 00:14:35,333
它看上去...

1029
00:14:34,392 --> 00:14:35,433
That one looks...

236
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:38,167
时间守护者监控着这个案件的每个环节

1030
00:14:35,517 --> 00:14:38,267
The Time-Keepers are monitoring every aspect of this case.

237
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,167
我从没见过他们这么在意

1031
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,267
I've never seen them so involved.

238
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,375
他们想要抓住那个时间犯

1032
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,475
They want that Variant caught.

239
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:43,958
我也一样

1033
00:14:42,558 --> 00:14:44,058
So do I.

240
00:14:44,042 --> 00:14:46,875
这是你和这个洛基在一起最后的机会

1034
00:14:44,142 --> 00:14:46,975
And this is the last chance you're gonna get with this Loki.

241
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,792
没问题 这就足够了

1035
00:14:47,058 --> 00:14:50,183
Great. That's all I'm gonna need.

242
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,792
谢谢你 洛斯蕾尔

1036
00:14:54,225 --> 00:14:56,892
Thank you, R Slayer.

243
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:01,208
富兰克林 D 罗斯福高中

244
00:15:01,292 --> 00:15:02,417
这个我也没印象

1037
00:15:01,392 --> 00:15:02,517
I don't remember this.

245
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,500
这肯定是你喜欢的那个分析师给的

1038
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,600
This must be from that analyst you keep on the side.

246
00:15:06,292 --> 00:15:07,750
别胡思乱想

1039
00:15:06,392 --> 00:15:07,850
Stay focused.

247
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,333
我专注着呢

1040
00:15:07,933 --> 00:15:09,433
Eyes on the road.

248
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,083
莫比乌斯？

1041
00:15:10,642 --> 00:15:12,183
RAVONNA: Mobius?

249
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:13,417
我差点就走了

1042
00:15:12,267 --> 00:15:13,517
I was almost gone.

250
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:15,750
你真的相信这个时间犯吗？

1043
00:15:14,142 --> 00:15:15,850
You really believe in this Variant?

1044
00:15:16,433 --> 00:15:20,267
Mmm... Luckily, he believes in himself enough for the both of us.

251
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:20,167
幸运的是 对于咱俩而言 他足够相信自己

252
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,000
而且如果行不通 我会亲手删除他

1045
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:23,100
And, hey, if it doesn't work, I'll delete him myself.

253
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,458
他真的很自负

1046
00:15:23,975 --> 00:15:25,558
He's really arrogant.

254
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:31,875
你可能想知道任务中到底是怎么回事

1047
00:15:29,267 --> 00:15:31,975
You're probably wondering what happened out on the mission.

255
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,458
那就是你抓住洛基的第一课

1048
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,558
That was your first lesson in catching a Loki.

256
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:38,500
掌控他人的预期

1049
00:15:36,642 --> 00:15:38,600
Expect the expected.

257
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,125
欺骗一半的乐趣来自于

1050
00:15:38,683 --> 00:15:40,225
Half the fun of being a trickster

258
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,708
知道大家都知道你是骗子 然后

1051
00:15:40,308 --> 00:15:42,808
is knowing everyone knows you're a trickster, and then,

259
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:44,667
很多骗术就可以基于

1052
00:15:42,892 --> 00:15:44,767
many of your tricks can come from exploiting

260
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,750
-你知道他们知道这个事实… -行了 闭嘴吧！

1053
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:47,850
-the fact that you know that they know... -Okay. Just shut up!

261
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:50,417
拜托 那个之前和我一起坐电梯的人呢？

1054
00:15:47,933 --> 00:15:50,517
Please. What happened to the guy I met on the elevator?

262
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,167
那人不爱说话 你记得吗？

1055
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,267
Who didn't like to talk. Remember him?

263
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,458
怎么就变成现在这样了

1056
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,558
Now I'm stuck with this guy

264
00:15:53,542 --> 00:15:56,083
没完没了地唠叨洛基的动机

1057
00:15:53,642 --> 00:15:56,183
who won't stop yacking away about what makes a Loki tick!

265
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:58,375
什么意思？ 这不就是我该干的吗？

1058
00:15:56,267 --> 00:15:58,475
What? Isn't that precisely why I'm here?

266
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,042
不是 你什么动机我不关心

1059
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:01,142
No. I don't care what makes you tick.

267
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:04,833
你得帮我抓到更高等的你

1060
00:16:01,225 --> 00:16:04,933
You're here to help me catch the superior version of yourself.

268
00:16:04,917 --> 00:16:05,917
-这就够了 -等等

1061
00:16:05,017 --> 00:16:06,017
-That's it! -Hang on.

269
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,500
“更高等”这个词用得不恰当吧

1062
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,600
I'm not sure "superior" is actually quite the right word.

270
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,292
你看？又来了 就是这样

1063
00:16:08,683 --> 00:16:10,392
See? There it is. Right there.

271
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,875
我愚蠢地认为

1064
00:16:10,475 --> 00:16:11,975
I believed, stupidly,

272
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:15,667
那种需要证明自己的不安全感 会让你有动力抓到凶手

1065
00:16:12,058 --> 00:16:15,767
that insecure need for validation would motivate you to find the killer.

273
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,542
不是因为你在乎时间变异管理局的任务 或者愿意当什么英雄

1066
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,642
Not 'cause you care about the TVA mission or bein' a hero,

274
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:24,083
而是因为你知道这个时间犯比你厉害 你接受不了这个事实

1067
00:16:18,725 --> 00:16:24,183
but because you know this Variant is better than you and you can't take it.

275
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:28,792
说得好

1068
00:16:27,517 --> 00:16:28,892
Very nice.

276
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:34,792
我的意思是 想要操控我 你也太天真了

1069
00:16:28,975 --> 00:16:34,892
I mean, it is adorable that you think you could possibly manipulate me.

277
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,417
我至少比你多算计十步

1070
00:16:35,808 --> 00:16:37,517
I'm ten steps ahead of you.

278
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,833
我可一直有我自己的打算

1071
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,933
I've been playing a game of my own all along.

279
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,750
你想干嘛？在时间守护者面前花言巧语

1072
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:43,850
What, charm your way in front of the Time-Keepers,

280
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:46,417
哄骗他们 然后控制时间变异管理局？

1073
00:16:43,933 --> 00:16:46,517
hustle them, and seize control of the TVA?

281
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,083
我猜得对吗？

1074
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,183
Am I getting warm?

282
00:16:48,167 --> 00:16:51,542
史上最厉害的骗子的经典骗术

1075
00:16:48,267 --> 00:16:51,642
A double cross by history's most reliable liar.

283
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,583
好吧 那你为什么在里面 还要为我冒险担保？

1076
00:16:51,725 --> 00:16:54,683
Okay. Why are you in there sticking your neck out for me?

284
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:55,792
我给你两个原因

1077
00:16:54,767 --> 00:16:55,892
I'll give you two options,

285
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,750
你爱信哪个信哪个

1078
00:16:55,975 --> 00:16:57,850
and you can believe whichever one you want.

286
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:01,625
其一 因为我看到一个被吓坏的小男孩 在寒风中瑟瑟发抖

1079
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:01,725
A, because I see a scared little boy, shivering in the cold.

287
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:04,000
谁还没点恻隐之心呢

1080
00:17:01,808 --> 00:17:04,100
And you kinda feel bad for that ice runt.

288
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:06,708
或者其二 我就是想抓住那家伙

1081
00:17:04,183 --> 00:17:06,808
Or B, I just wanna catch this guy,

289
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:09,042
所以该告诉你的 我一字不差地告诉你

1082
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:09,142
and I'll tell you whatever I need to tell you.

290
00:17:13,792 --> 00:17:15,208
我不需要你的怜悯

1083
00:17:13,892 --> 00:17:15,308
I don't need your sympathy.

291
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:17,167
好极了 因为我的怜悯也快没了

1084
00:17:15,392 --> 00:17:17,267
Good, 'cause I'm runnin' out of it.

292
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:21,958
什么意思？ 这是为了操控我的下一步...

1085
00:17:20,058 --> 00:17:22,058
What's this? Next step of your manipulation...

293
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:24,083
这是最后一步 你最后的机会

1086
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:24,183
This is the final step. Your last chance.

294
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:26,958
我最后的机会需要干点什么？

1087
00:17:24,267 --> 00:17:27,058
Oh, and what does my desperate last chance require?

295
00:17:27,042 --> 00:17:28,167
干活

1088
00:17:27,142 --> 00:17:28,267
Work.

296
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,375
干活？

1089
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,475
Work?

297
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:55,500
我需要你去重新看一遍 每个时间犯的卷宗

1090
00:17:52,433 --> 00:17:55,600
I need you to go over each and every one of the Variant's case files,

298
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,375
然后 给我你的... 怎么说来着？

1091
00:17:55,683 --> 00:17:57,475
and then, give me your... How do I put it?

299
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,708
你独特的洛基视角

1092
00:17:57,558 --> 00:17:59,808
Your unique Loki perspective.

300
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:02,167
谁知道呢？ 没准我们真有漏看的东西

1093
00:17:59,892 --> 00:18:02,267
And who knows? Maybe there's something that we missed.

301
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,792
你们这群笨蛋 漏掉的东西肯定不少

1094
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,892
Well, you're idiots. I suspect you probably missed a lot.

302
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,500
要不说有你在算我走运呢

1095
00:18:04,975 --> 00:18:07,600
That's why I'm lucky I got ya for a little bit longer.

303
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:08,958
你就在这开始吧

1096
00:18:07,683 --> 00:18:09,058
Let me park ya at this desk.

304
00:18:09,042 --> 00:18:11,500
一定要不辞辛劳全情投入

1097
00:18:09,142 --> 00:18:11,600
And don't be afraid to really lean into this work.

305
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,000
给你个小建议

1098
00:18:11,683 --> 00:18:13,100
Here's a good trick for you.

306
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,792
就当这份工作攸关性命

1099
00:18:13,183 --> 00:18:14,892
Pretend your life depends on it.

307
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,083
我去吃点东西

1100
00:18:14,975 --> 00:18:16,183
I'm gonna get a snack.

308
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,708
我的天啊

1101
00:18:31,183 --> 00:18:32,808
Oh, my goodness.

309
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:36,375
这个时间犯不会又偷袭杀害了 一队时间卫士吧

1102
00:18:32,892 --> 00:18:36,475
Don't tell me the Variant ambushed and killed another team of Minutemen.

1103
00:18:37,308 --> 00:18:40,308
And stole their reset charge as well.

310
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,208
而且还又偷走了重置器

1104
00:18:43,933 --> 00:18:44,933
Shh.

1105
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:55,558
Shh.

311
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,000
嗨

1106
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:08,100
Hi.

312
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,000
你好？

1107
00:19:11,933 --> 00:19:13,100
Hello?

313
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,125
需要帮忙吗？

1108
00:19:23,183 --> 00:19:24,225
Can I help you?

314
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,708
是的 我正在进行 重要的时间变异管理局工作

1109
00:19:24,308 --> 00:19:26,808
Yes. I'm on some important TVA business.

315
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,875
我跟着他们一起外出行动 你知道行动是什么样的

1110
00:19:27,683 --> 00:19:29,975
Follow-up to a field mission. You know how it goes.

316
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:33,208
那个红线就快到峰值了…

1111
00:19:30,058 --> 00:19:33,308
We red lined near the apex, and...

317
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:35,375
好吧 这行不通

1112
00:19:33,392 --> 00:19:35,850
Well, it's never good.

318
00:19:37,917 --> 00:19:42,583
我需要所有关于 时间变异管理局创立的文件

1113
00:19:38,017 --> 00:19:42,683
Um, I'd like all files pertaining to the creation of the TVA, please.

319
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,500
那些是机密

1114
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:45,600
Those are classified.

320
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:50,792
好吧 那就给我所有 关于时间起始的文件吧

1115
00:19:47,267 --> 00:19:50,892
Okay. I'd like all files pertaining to the beginning of time then.

321
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,833
-那些是机密 -好吧 时间尽头的也行

1116
00:19:50,975 --> 00:19:52,933
-Those are classified. -Okay, the end of time.

322
00:19:52,917 --> 00:19:55,208
-那些是机密 -好吧 什么文件我能看？

1117
00:19:53,017 --> 00:19:55,308
-Those are classified. -Okay, what files can I have?

323
00:20:02,542 --> 00:20:03,875
祝你读得开心

1118
00:20:02,642 --> 00:20:03,975
Happy reading.

324
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,625
时间犯卷宗 姓名：劳菲森 洛基

325
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:24,125
时间查询 阿斯加德毁灭事件 细节

326
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:38,250
诸神的黄昏（七级末日）

327
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:43,542
星球完全毁灭

328
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,375
没有检测到时间犯能量 取代时间

329
00:20:47,042 --> 00:20:49,292
整个文明灭绝

330
00:20:53,167 --> 00:20:55,417
伤亡人数 9719

331
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,208
没有检测到时间犯能量 取代时间

332
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,708
我发现了些东西

1119
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,808
I found something.

333
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:24,583
不对 我说过了 “在读完所有卷宗前别来烦我”

1120
00:21:21,892 --> 00:21:24,683
No, I said, "Don't bother me until you've read all the files."

334
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:25,792
-我读完了 -所有卷宗？

1121
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:25,892
-I have. -Every file?

335
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,250
-是的 -所有和时间犯有关的？

1122
00:21:25,975 --> 00:21:27,350
-Yes. -Pertaining to the Variant?

336
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,750
答案不在卷宗里 而是在时间线上

1123
00:21:27,433 --> 00:21:29,850
The answer isn't in the files, it's on the timeline.

337
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:34,333
他藏在末日里

1124
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:34,433
He's hiding in apocalypses.

338
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,458
哪个末日？

1125
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,558
Which apocalypse?

339
00:21:36,542 --> 00:21:38,958
历史上随便哪个？ 大概得有一百万个吧

1126
00:21:36,642 --> 00:21:39,058
Any time in history? There's, like, a million of 'em.

340
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,083
诸神的黄昏 你知道吗？

1127
00:21:40,183 --> 00:21:42,183
Ragnarok. Are you familiar?

341
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:46,083
是的 阿斯加德和几乎 所有子民的覆灭 请节哀

1128
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:46,183
Yes. The destruction of Asgard and most of its people. I'm sorry.

342
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:47,750
是的 非常伤感

1129
00:21:46,267 --> 00:21:47,850
Yes, very sad.

343
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,167
随便吧 我有个想法…

1130
00:21:47,933 --> 00:21:49,267
Anyway, it got me thinking...

344
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,500
接着说

1131
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,600
Go ahead.

345
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,458
关连事件

1132
00:21:52,808 --> 00:21:54,558
Nexus events

346
00:21:54,542 --> 00:21:58,833
出现是因为某人做了不该做的事 对吗？

1133
00:21:54,642 --> 00:21:58,933
happen when someone does something they're not supposed to do, right?

347
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:01,458
可能更复杂点 但基本上是吧

1134
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:01,558
Well, it's a little more complicated, but, yeah.

348
00:22:01,542 --> 00:22:04,375
好 然后他们不该做的那些事

1135
00:22:01,642 --> 00:22:04,475
Great. And then that thing they're not supposed to do,

349
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:08,000
会引发一系列不该发生的连锁反应

1136
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:08,100
cascades into a whole range of other things that aren't supposed to happen.

350
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:11,792
然后不断继续 直到出现一个新的时间分支 对吗？

1137
00:22:08,183 --> 00:22:11,892
And so on and so forth, until eventually, a new timeline branches. Yes?

351
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:14,458
对于既定结果的混乱改动

1138
00:22:11,975 --> 00:22:14,558
Chaotic alterations of a predetermined outcome.

352
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:17,625
-没错 所以 假设… -你要干什么？

1139
00:22:14,642 --> 00:22:17,725
-Exactly. So, let's just say... -Mmm-hmm. What are you doing?

353
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,917
你的沙拉就是阿斯加德

1140
00:22:17,808 --> 00:22:20,017
...your salad is Asgard in this scenario.

354
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,542
-这不是阿斯加德 这是我的午饭 -我打个比方

1141
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,642
-It's not Asgard, that's my lunch. -It's a metaphor.

355
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:24,250
-先别急 -我想吃那个沙拉

1142
00:22:22,725 --> 00:22:24,350
-Just hang in there. -I want that salad.

356
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:27,125
我可以去阿斯加德

1143
00:22:24,433 --> 00:22:27,225
And I could go down to Asgard

357
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:30,042
在诸神的黄昏完全毁灭一切之前

1144
00:22:27,308 --> 00:22:30,142
before Ragnarok causes its complete destruction

358
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:31,792
我想干什么就干什么

1145
00:22:30,225 --> 00:22:31,892
and I could do anything I wanted.

359
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:37,625
我可以 比如说 把浩克从彩虹桥推下去

1146
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:37,725
I could, let's say, push the Hulk off the Rainbow Bridge.

360
00:22:38,542 --> 00:22:40,833
-他掉下去了 -盐就是浩克？

1147
00:22:38,642 --> 00:22:40,933
-There he goes. -The salt's Hulk?

361
00:22:40,917 --> 00:22:44,625
我还可以… 把宫殿给烧掉

1148
00:22:41,017 --> 00:22:44,725
And I could also... Set fire to the palace.

362
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:47,917
不要 住手 别把宫殿给烧掉

1149
00:22:44,808 --> 00:22:48,017
No, just stop. Don't set fire to the palace.

363
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,167
明白了吗？我想干什么就干什么 不会有任何影响

1150
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:52,267
Okay? I can do whatever I want to do, and it would never matter.

364
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,625
一切都不会违背既定的时间线 因为…

1151
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:55,725
It wouldn't go against the dictates of the timeline because...

365
00:23:00,417 --> 00:23:01,833
-打扰一下 -天啊！

1152
00:23:00,517 --> 00:23:01,933
-Excuse me? -MOBIUS: Oh, God!

366
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:04,042
-是你 -很高兴见到你

1153
00:23:03,017 --> 00:23:04,142
-You! -Nice to see you.

367
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:06,167
借用一下 谢谢

1154
00:23:04,225 --> 00:23:06,267
I just need this for a second. Thanks.

368
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:09,500
因为反正末日就要来了

1155
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:09,600
Because the apocalypse is coming.

369
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:13,667
诸神的黄昏 无论我做什么 苏尔特尔都会毁灭阿斯加德

1156
00:23:09,683 --> 00:23:13,767
Ragnarok, Surtur will destroy Asgard no matter what I do.

370
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,500
不 别毁啊…

1157
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,308
No, don't do...

371
00:23:16,292 --> 00:23:19,250
-末日到来了 -那是末日吗？

1158
00:23:16,392 --> 00:23:19,350
LOKI: There's the apocalypse. MOBIUS: That's the apocalypse?

372
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:22,083
诸神的黄昏抹掉了盐的存在

1159
00:23:19,433 --> 00:23:22,183
Ragnarok obliterates the salt.

373
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,250
诸神的黄昏

1160
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,350
Ragnarok.

374
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:30,208
就是这意思

1161
00:23:29,058 --> 00:23:30,308
There it is.

375
00:23:30,292 --> 00:23:31,542
我到底在看什么？

1162
00:23:30,392 --> 00:23:31,642
What am I lookin' at?

376
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:34,500
好吧 这个比喻有点简单粗暴 但是你明白我的意思

1163
00:23:31,725 --> 00:23:34,600
Okay, it was a clumsy metaphor. But you see what I mean.

377
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:37,500
无所谓的 可能是任何一个末日

1164
00:23:34,683 --> 00:23:37,600
It doesn't matter. It could be any apocalypse.

378
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,917
可能是海啸巨浪 可能是陨石

1165
00:23:37,683 --> 00:23:40,017
It could be a tidal wave. It could be a meteor.

379
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,167
还可能是火山爆发 或者超新星爆炸

1166
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,267
It could be a volcano, a supernova.

380
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:47,167
如果周围的所有人或者事物都注定立刻毁灭

1167
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:47,267
If everything and everyone around you is destined for imminent destruction,

381
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:51,208
那我说什么或者做什么都无所谓

1168
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:51,308
then nothing that I say or do will matter,

382
00:23:52,042 --> 00:23:54,417
因为时间线不会出现分支

1169
00:23:52,142 --> 00:23:54,517
because the timeline's not gonna branch.

383
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,875
因为这条时间线被毁灭了

1170
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,975
'Cause it gets destroyed.

384
00:23:56,958 --> 00:24:01,167
因此 时间犯可能就藏在末日之中

1171
00:23:57,058 --> 00:24:01,267
Hence, the Variant could be hiding in the apocalypse

385
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:04,000
他可以随心所欲 我们也无从得知

1172
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:04,100
and do whatever he wants, and we wouldn't know!

386
00:24:06,042 --> 00:24:07,042
不错

1173
00:24:06,142 --> 00:24:07,142
Not bad.

387
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:09,917
带我去个真的末日 去诸神的黄昏吧 我展示给你看

1174
00:24:07,225 --> 00:24:10,017
Take me to a real apocalypse, to Ragnarok, I'll show you.

388
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,125
好啊 然后你就可以跑回老家去了？你休想

1175
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,225
Yeah. So you can run away back to your homeland? No.

389
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:15,083
不 我没想回家 咱们去哪都行

1176
00:24:13,308 --> 00:24:15,183
No, I'm not going home. We can go anywhere.

390
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:19,125
我连海滨公园散步都不会带你去 末日就更别提了

1177
00:24:15,267 --> 00:24:19,225
I'm not taking you for a stroll along the promenade, much less an apocalypse.

391
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,750
莫比乌斯 别这样

1178
00:24:19,308 --> 00:24:20,850
Oh, Mobius, come on!

392
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:22,167
能有什么问题呢？

1179
00:24:20,933 --> 00:24:22,267
What could possibly go wrong?

393
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,875
咱们得测试一下这个理论

1180
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,975
We gotta properly test this theory.

394
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:25,417
我倒是有个有趣的理论

1181
00:24:24,058 --> 00:24:25,517
Well, here's a fun theory.

395
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,125
你诱惑我外出行动 然后在背后捅我一刀

1182
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,225
You lure me out into the field, and stab me in the back.

396
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:30,125
这个理论我可不想冒险

1183
00:24:28,308 --> 00:24:30,225
And that's a theory I don't wanna test.

397
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,958
我从来没在背后捅过人

1184
00:24:30,308 --> 00:24:32,058
I'd never stab anyone in the back.

398
00:24:32,042 --> 00:24:33,875
这种背叛也太没创意了

1185
00:24:32,142 --> 00:24:33,975
That's such a boring form of betrayal.

399
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:37,000
洛基 我研究过你这一生的每个时刻

1186
00:24:34,058 --> 00:24:37,100
Loki, I've studied almost every moment of your entire life.

400
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:40,167
你在背后捅人 少说得有五十次

1187
00:24:37,183 --> 00:24:40,267
You've literally stabbed people in the back, like, 50 times.

401
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,292
那我绝对不会再捅了 因为这太老套了

1188
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:44,392
Well, I'd never do it again, because it got old.

1189
00:24:44,475 --> 00:24:46,517
Okay.

402
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:46,417
好吧

403
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,167
好吧 那这样 你可以不相信我 但是你得相信一点

1190
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,267
Okay, look, you don't trust me, you can trust one thing.

404
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:52,292
我喜欢证明我是对的

1191
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:52,392
I love to be right.

405
00:24:57,042 --> 00:25:00,792
意大利 庞贝

406
00:25:08,208 --> 00:25:11,417
公元79年

407
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:15,250
-准备开始了 -随时都有可能

1192
00:25:12,767 --> 00:25:15,350
- Here we go. -Shh, any minute now.

408
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:18,125
整个城镇会被从这个星球抹掉

1193
00:25:15,433 --> 00:25:18,225
Until this entire town is wiped off the face of this planet.

409
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:20,792
想象一下 那些火山灰…

1194
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,892
Imagine. All that volcanic ash...

410
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:22,625
我知道 咱们也不用那么兴奋吧

1195
00:25:20,975 --> 00:25:22,725
I know. We don't want to get too giddy.

411
00:25:22,708 --> 00:25:24,167
来嘛 多酷啊

1196
00:25:22,808 --> 00:25:24,267
Oh, come on! It's cool.

412
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,833
确实很酷 但是不那么好受 因为...

1197
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,933
No, it is cool, but it's just not in good taste because...

413
00:25:26,917 --> 00:25:28,458
反正他们怎么着都会死

1198
00:25:27,017 --> 00:25:28,558
They're all gonna die anyway.

414
00:25:28,542 --> 00:25:32,333
我知道 听我说 我就盯着传送器上的变异能量

1199
00:25:28,642 --> 00:25:32,433
I know. Now listen, I'm gonna watch the TemPad for any variance energy.

415
00:25:32,417 --> 00:25:34,542
-好的 -好的 因为我们得小心行事

1200
00:25:32,517 --> 00:25:34,642
-Okay. -Okay, because we gotta be careful.

416
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:36,875
如果你错了 而且很有可能你会错

1201
00:25:34,725 --> 00:25:36,975
If you're wrong, and there's a good chance you are,

417
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:39,375
我们的所作所为会导致一个巨大的时间分支

1202
00:25:37,058 --> 00:25:39,475
anything we do can create a huge branch.

418
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:42,375
莫比乌斯 世界末日都让你搞得索然无味了

1203
00:25:39,558 --> 00:25:42,475
Oh, Mobius! You make even the end of the world sound boring.

419
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,750
听着 好吧 我们就不该在这里

1204
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:44,850
Listen! Okay, we're not meant to be here.

420
00:25:44,833 --> 00:25:46,458
-好吗？ -好吧

1205
00:25:44,933 --> 00:25:46,558
-Okay? -Okay.

421
00:25:46,542 --> 00:25:48,667
我们的动作可能会影响历史进程

1206
00:25:46,642 --> 00:25:48,767
Anything we do can impact the course of history.

422
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,125
-你明白吗？ -明白 明白

1207
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,225
-Do you get that? -Yes. Yes.

423
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:52,500
所以咱们得从非常小的干扰开始

1208
00:25:50,308 --> 00:25:52,600
So we're gonna start with very small disturbances.

424
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:54,500
-非常小的 -你会鸟叫吗？

1209
00:25:52,683 --> 00:25:54,600
-Very small. -Can you make bird noises?

425
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:56,667
鸟叫？

1210
00:25:55,683 --> 00:25:56,767
Bird noises?

426
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,417
是啊 鸟叫 就是那种从嘴里吹气的声音

1211
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:59,517
Yeah. Bird noises. Like some, like, whooshing noises.

1212
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,308
--Oh.

427
00:26:01,292 --> 00:26:03,333
洛基 洛基

1213
00:26:01,392 --> 00:26:03,433
Loki! Loki!

1214
00:26:04,267 --> 00:26:09,392
--Go!

428
00:26:04,833 --> 00:26:06,125
走吧！

429
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:12,375
享受自由吧 头上长角的朋友 你们自由了

1215
00:26:09,475 --> 00:26:12,475
Be free, my horned-friends, be free!

430
00:26:12,458 --> 00:26:15,333
我叫洛基

431
00:26:15,417 --> 00:26:19,583
我们是时间变异管理局的特工

432
00:26:19,667 --> 00:26:23,292
我给你们带来了黑暗的消息

433
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:25,292
你们所有人！

434
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:28,250
都要葬身于此

435
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:34,958
那座火山即将喷发！

436
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:41,417
我能知道是因为我来自未来

437
00:26:42,417 --> 00:26:43,958
我们是来自未来的 对吧？

1216
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,058
We are from the future, right?

438
00:26:44,042 --> 00:26:46,125
时间变异管理局是什么？ 我的意思是 它来自于未来

1217
00:26:44,142 --> 00:26:46,225
What is the TVA? I mean, it's from the future.

439
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:48,583
听着就特别未来 真的很有未来感

1218
00:26:46,308 --> 00:26:48,683
It sounds from the future. It's pretty future-y.

440
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:52,417
时间刚刚好！

1219
00:26:50,725 --> 00:26:52,517
Right on cue!

441
00:26:53,042 --> 00:26:55,458
享受你们的最后一餐吧

1220
00:26:53,142 --> 00:26:55,558
Enjoy your last meal while you can!

442
00:26:55,542 --> 00:26:57,625
一切都不重要了！

1221
00:26:55,642 --> 00:26:57,725
Nothing matters!

443
00:26:57,708 --> 00:26:59,792
不会有任何后果！

1222
00:26:57,808 --> 00:26:59,892
Nothing has any consequence!

444
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:02,167
趁着没死继续跳舞吧！

1223
00:26:59,975 --> 00:27:02,267
Dance while you still can!

1224
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,933
- Whoo-hoo! -

445
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,583
情况如何？

1225
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,683
How'd we do?

446
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:09,792
难以置信 变异能量为零

1226
00:27:06,767 --> 00:27:09,892
I don't believe it. Zero variance energy.

447
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:11,500
也没有产生时间分支

1227
00:27:09,975 --> 00:27:11,600
No branching in the timeline.

448
00:27:11,583 --> 00:27:14,750
时间变异管理局根本不知道咱们在这里

1228
00:27:11,683 --> 00:27:14,850
The TVA would never even know we were here.

449
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:18,250
如果是我的话 这就是我的藏身之处

1229
00:27:15,475 --> 00:27:18,350
If it were me, this is where I would hide.

450
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:24,708
是末日 时间犯偷袭我们的士兵

1230
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:24,808
Doomsdays. The Variant's been ambushing our soldiers

451
00:27:24,792 --> 00:27:26,792
然后藏在末日里 隐匿行踪

1231
00:27:24,892 --> 00:27:26,892
and hiding out in doomsdays to cover his tracks.

452
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:27,875
-不用谢 -好

1232
00:27:26,975 --> 00:27:27,975
-You're welcome. -Yeah.

453
00:27:27,958 --> 00:27:29,958
要让这个理论成立 灾难就应该是

1233
00:27:28,058 --> 00:27:30,058
For this theory to hold, the disasters have to be

454
00:27:30,042 --> 00:27:32,958
自然发生的 突如其来的 毫无征兆的 无人幸免的

1234
00:27:30,142 --> 00:27:33,058
naturally-occurring, sudden, no warning, no survivors.

455
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:35,042
-有多少符合条件的？ -我不知道

1235
00:27:33,142 --> 00:27:35,142
-How many could there be? -I don't know.

456
00:27:35,125 --> 00:27:36,125
我们会知道的

1236
00:27:35,225 --> 00:27:36,225
We're gonna find out.

457
00:27:43,292 --> 00:27:44,333
嘿？

1237
00:27:43,392 --> 00:27:44,433
Hey?

458
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:47,167
来吧 咱们一起走走

1238
00:27:45,475 --> 00:27:47,267
Come on, let's take a walk.

459
00:27:54,167 --> 00:27:58,542
话说 你桌上的那本杂志

1239
00:27:54,267 --> 00:27:58,642
By the way, at your desk, that magazine?

460
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:00,958
有摩托艇那本？

1240
00:27:58,725 --> 00:28:01,058
Yeah. The one on jet skis?

461
00:28:01,042 --> 00:28:02,333
是的

1241
00:28:01,142 --> 00:28:02,433
Yes.

462
00:28:02,417 --> 00:28:03,792
你要那个干什么？

1242
00:28:02,517 --> 00:28:03,892
Why do you have that?

463
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:06,292
因为它们棒极了

1243
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:06,392
Because they're awesome.

1244
00:28:06,475 --> 00:28:09,267
- I suppose they are. -Yeah.

464
00:28:07,458 --> 00:28:09,167
-我知道 -是

465
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:12,667
有些东西…其实历史上大多数东西都挺蠢的

1245
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:12,767
You know, some things... Actually, most things in history are kinda dumb,

466
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:15,417
而且最终一切都会湮灭

1246
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:15,517
and everything gets ruined eventually.

467
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:20,250
但是在九十年代初期 有一段短暂的辉煌

1247
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,350
But in the early 1990s, for a brief, shining moment,

468
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:24,417
那是外形与功能的美丽统一

1248
00:28:20,433 --> 00:28:24,517
there was a beautiful union of form and function,

469
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,250
那就是摩托艇

1249
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,350
which we call the jet ski,

470
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:28,625
任何有理智的人都会感同身受

1250
00:28:26,433 --> 00:28:28,725
and a reasonable man cannot differ.

471
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,625
你骑过吗？

1251
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:31,725
You ever been on one?

472
00:28:31,708 --> 00:28:34,208
没有…没有

1252
00:28:31,808 --> 00:28:34,308
No... No.

473
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:39,000
如果时间变异管理局的特工 骑着摩托艇出现在神圣的时间线上

1253
00:28:35,225 --> 00:28:39,100
I think a TVA agent showing up on a jet ski on the Sacred Timeline,

474
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:41,042
一定会产生时间分支

1254
00:28:39,183 --> 00:28:41,142
that would create a branch for sure.

475
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:42,292
不过肯定很有趣

1255
00:28:41,225 --> 00:28:42,392
It'd be fun, though.

476
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:44,875
是的 绝对很有趣

1256
00:28:42,475 --> 00:28:44,975
Yeah, it'd be really fun.

477
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,583
所以 为什么看那些？

1257
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,683
So, why read about them?

478
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:53,000
就是提醒我自己 我们是为什么而奋斗

1258
00:28:49,475 --> 00:28:53,100
Just helps remind me of what we're fighting for.

479
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:58,792
我的意思是 你对这一切都深信不疑 对不对？

1259
00:28:55,683 --> 00:28:58,892
I mean, you really believe in all this stuff, don't you?

480
00:28:58,875 --> 00:29:02,000
我不会在 “相信或不相信” 这件事上纠结

1260
00:28:58,975 --> 00:29:02,100
I don't get hung up on, "Believe, not believe."

481
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:04,208
我就是接受了这一切

1261
00:29:02,183 --> 00:29:04,308
I just accept what is.

482
00:29:04,292 --> 00:29:07,250
-三只魔法蜥蜴 -是时间守护者

1262
00:29:04,392 --> 00:29:07,350
-Three magic lizards... -Time-Keepers.

483
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:09,542
-创造了时间变异管理局和这里所有的人 -没错

1263
00:29:07,433 --> 00:29:09,642
-...created the TVA, and everyone in it... -Right.

484
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:11,750
-也包括你？ -也包括我

1264
00:29:09,725 --> 00:29:11,850
-...including you? -Including me.

485
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,875
每一次我想夸你聪明的时候

1265
00:29:11,933 --> 00:29:13,975
Every time I start to admire your intelligence,

486
00:29:13,958 --> 00:29:16,583
-你就开始说这种话 -好吧 是谁创造的你 洛基？

1266
00:29:14,058 --> 00:29:16,683
-you say something like that. -Okay, who created you, Loki?

487
00:29:17,458 --> 00:29:18,958
约顿海姆的冰霜巨人

1267
00:29:17,558 --> 00:29:19,058
A Frost Giant of Jotunheim.

488
00:29:19,042 --> 00:29:20,375
那是谁养育的你呢？

1268
00:29:19,142 --> 00:29:20,475
And who raised you?

489
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:21,667
阿斯加德的奥丁

1269
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:21,767
Odin of Asgard.

490
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:24,000
奥丁 天界之神

1270
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:24,100
Odin, God of the Heavens.

491
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:27,292
阿斯加德 神秘的国度 远在星辰大海

1271
00:29:24,183 --> 00:29:27,475
Asgard, mystical realm, beyond the stars.

492
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:29,917
-冰霜巨人 你自己听听… -这不一样

1272
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:30,058
-Frost Giants. Listen to yourself... -It's not the same.

493
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,333
-这完全不一样啊 -不

1273
00:29:30,142 --> 00:29:31,433
-It's completely different. -No.

494
00:29:31,417 --> 00:29:33,833
-这不是一回事 -这就是一回事

1274
00:29:31,517 --> 00:29:33,933
-It's not the same. -It's exactly the same thing.

495
00:29:33,917 --> 00:29:36,625
因为如果深究我们从哪里来的问题

1275
00:29:34,017 --> 00:29:36,725
Because if you think too hard about where any of us came from,

496
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:39,375
我们到底是什么的问题 听起来都有点荒谬

1276
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:39,475
who we truly are, it sounds kinda ridiculous.

497
00:29:39,458 --> 00:29:41,292
存在即混乱

1277
00:29:39,558 --> 00:29:41,392
Existence is chaos.

498
00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:44,458
没什么是有意义的 所以我们就试着寻找意义

1278
00:29:41,475 --> 00:29:44,558
Nothing makes any sense, so we try to make some sense of it.

499
00:29:44,542 --> 00:29:48,833
我很幸运 我出身的混乱赐予了我这一切…

1279
00:29:44,642 --> 00:29:48,933
And I'm just lucky that the chaos I emerged into gave me all this...

500
00:29:49,625 --> 00:29:51,583
我的光荣使命

1280
00:29:49,725 --> 00:29:52,642
- My own glorious purpose. -

501
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,500
时间变异管理局就是我的生命

1281
00:29:52,725 --> 00:29:54,600
'Cause the TVA is my life.

502
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:56,708
它是真实的 因为我相信它是真实的

1282
00:29:54,683 --> 00:29:56,808
And it's real because I believe it's real.

503
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:02,333
行吧 你相信它是真实的

1283
00:29:59,933 --> 00:30:02,433
Fair enough. You believe it's real.

504
00:30:02,417 --> 00:30:03,792
是的

1284
00:30:02,517 --> 00:30:03,892
Yeah.

505
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:05,583
所以一切都是注定的

1285
00:30:03,975 --> 00:30:05,683
So everything is written.

506
00:30:05,667 --> 00:30:07,833
过去 现在 将来

1286
00:30:05,767 --> 00:30:07,933
Past, present, future.

507
00:30:07,917 --> 00:30:09,708
根本就没有什么自由意志

1287
00:30:08,017 --> 00:30:09,808
There's no such thing as free will.

508
00:30:09,792 --> 00:30:13,250
我觉得 这种说法过于简化了

1288
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:13,350
Well, I mean, you know, it's an oversimplification...

509
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:14,833
所以 事实上 可以这么说

1289
00:30:13,433 --> 00:30:14,933
So, in fact, in a way,

510
00:30:15,792 --> 00:30:21,208
在时间变异管理局这里 你我是唯一真正自由的

1290
00:30:15,892 --> 00:30:21,308
you and I here at the TVA, we're the only ones who are actually free.

511
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,667
你到底想说什么 洛基？

1291
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,767
Where are you going with this, Loki?

512
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:27,208
那这一切怎么结束？

1292
00:30:25,975 --> 00:30:27,308
How does it all end?

513
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:28,875
工作还没干完呢

1293
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:28,975
That's a work in progress.

1294
00:30:29,058 --> 00:30:32,017
Oh, those lazy Time-Keepers. What are they waiting for?

514
00:30:29,458 --> 00:30:31,917
那些懒散的时间守护者 他们在等待什么？

515
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,208
并非如此

1295
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,308
Au contraire.

516
00:30:33,292 --> 00:30:36,750
在我们保护过去的时候

1296
00:30:33,392 --> 00:30:36,850
No. Because while we protect what came before,

517
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:39,417
他们正在室内伏案工作

1297
00:30:36,933 --> 00:30:39,517
they're toiling away in their chamber,

518
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:43,792
厘清无限分支中的终极结局

1298
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,892
untangling the epilogue from its infinite branches.

519
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:47,167
我明白了 那当他们完成的时候 会发生什么？

1299
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:47,267
Ah, I see. So, when they're finished, what happens then?

520
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,583
我们的工作也就完成了

1300
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,683
So are we.

521
00:30:48,667 --> 00:30:50,292
再也没有关连事件了

1301
00:30:48,767 --> 00:30:50,392
No more nexus events.

522
00:30:50,375 --> 00:30:51,417
只有秩序

1302
00:30:50,475 --> 00:30:51,517
Just order.

523
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,125
然后我们在时间的尽头平静相见

1303
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,225
And we meet in peace at the end of time.

524
00:30:55,292 --> 00:30:56,708
是不是很棒？

1304
00:30:55,392 --> 00:30:56,808
Nice, right?

525
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:00,250
只有秩序？

1305
00:30:59,058 --> 00:31:00,350
-Only order? -Mmm-hmm.

526
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:03,000
没有混乱吗？听起来很无聊

1306
00:31:00,433 --> 00:31:03,100
No chaos? It sounds boring.

527
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:04,792
你肯定觉得无聊

1307
00:31:03,183 --> 00:31:04,892
I'm sure it does to you.

528
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:06,667
你说我是被吓坏的小男孩

1308
00:31:04,975 --> 00:31:06,767
You called me a scared little boy.

529
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,208
我说你的可不止这个

1309
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:08,308
I called you a lotta things.

530
00:31:08,292 --> 00:31:09,458
的确如此

1310
00:31:08,392 --> 00:31:09,558
You did.

531
00:31:10,542 --> 00:31:11,708
但是你错了

1311
00:31:10,642 --> 00:31:11,808
You're wrong, though.

532
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:15,250
你看 我比孩子知道得多

1312
00:31:13,475 --> 00:31:15,350
You see, I know something children don't.

533
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:16,625
知道什么呢？

1313
00:31:15,433 --> 00:31:16,725
What's that?

534
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,583
没有纯粹的坏人

1314
00:31:17,433 --> 00:31:19,683
That no one bad is ever truly bad.

535
00:31:21,042 --> 00:31:23,167
也没有纯粹的好人

1315
00:31:21,142 --> 00:31:23,267
And no one good is ever truly good.

536
00:31:26,542 --> 00:31:27,833
被吓坏的小男孩

1316
00:31:26,642 --> 00:31:27,933
Scared little boy.

537
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:31,958
是的 你这是自以为高人一等 我其实觉得挺过分的

1317
00:31:28,808 --> 00:31:32,058
Yes, it was quite patronizing. I thought it was a bit too far, actually.

538
00:31:32,792 --> 00:31:33,958
没错

539
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:37,792
你可真聪明

1318
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:37,892
You're very clever.

540
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:41,167
当然了

1319
00:31:40,267 --> 00:31:41,267
I know.

541
00:31:43,583 --> 00:31:46,833
这个时间犯在犯罪现场留下了些东西

1320
00:31:43,683 --> 00:31:46,933
The Variant left something behind at an old crime scene.

542
00:31:46,917 --> 00:31:48,875
那是个大教堂 他留下了一个糖果盒

1321
00:31:47,017 --> 00:31:48,975
A cathedral. A candy box.

543
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:50,250
明显不符合那个时代

1322
00:31:49,058 --> 00:31:50,350
An obvious anachronism.

544
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:53,000
我交给分析部了 但是他们没发现什么

1323
00:31:50,433 --> 00:31:53,100
I gave it to Analysis, but they couldn't find anything real.

545
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:55,667
-为什么要提起这个？ -因为这样我们就有两个变量了

1324
00:31:53,183 --> 00:31:55,767
-Why does that matter? -'Cause now we have two variables.

546
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,833
末日 自然灾害 以及…

1325
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,933
Apocalyptic natural disasters and...

547
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:03,292
-卡布路易 -那是什么？

1326
00:32:01,183 --> 00:32:03,392
-Kablooie. -LOKI: What's that?

548
00:32:03,375 --> 00:32:05,792
是糖果 阿斯加德有糖果吗？

1327
00:32:03,475 --> 00:32:05,892
Candy. Do you have candy on Asgard?

549
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:07,292
有啊 有葡萄和坚果

1328
00:32:05,975 --> 00:32:07,392
Yeah. Grapes, nuts.

550
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:09,750
怪不得你那么苦大仇深的

1329
00:32:08,058 --> 00:32:09,850
No wonder you're so bitter.

551
00:32:10,417 --> 00:32:14,833
好吧 卡布路易只有2047年到2051年间 在地球的个别地区发售过

1330
00:32:10,517 --> 00:32:14,933
Okay. Kablooie was only sold regionally on Earth from 2047 to 2051.

552
00:32:14,917 --> 00:32:18,000
我们需要对每一个末日事件进行交叉比对

1331
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:18,100
We need to cross-reference that with every apocalyptic event.

553
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:19,167
这一半你来

1332
00:32:18,183 --> 00:32:19,267
I'm gonna give you half.

554
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,833
咱们比比看谁先找到

1333
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,933
Have a competition, see who finds it.

555
00:32:20,917 --> 00:32:22,417
-没问题 -你想赌点什么吗？

1334
00:32:21,017 --> 00:32:22,517
-Sure. -You wanna bet something?

556
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,875
-好啊 -来一场绅士的赌局

1335
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,975
-Yeah. -Gentleman's bet.

557
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:26,958
是的 赌上我们的骄傲 好的 用实力说话 开始

1336
00:32:24,058 --> 00:32:27,058
Yeah, let's play for pride. Okay. May the best man win. Go.

558
00:32:28,208 --> 00:32:30,000
发现什么了吗？

1337
00:32:28,308 --> 00:32:30,100
-Anything? -Uh...

559
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:32,458
肯定不是2048年的气候灾难

1338
00:32:30,183 --> 00:32:32,558
It's not the climate disaster of 2048.

560
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:34,667
也不是2051年的海啸

1339
00:32:33,225 --> 00:32:34,767
Or the tsunami of 2051.

561
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,708
赶紧 赶紧 加把劲

1340
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:36,808
Let's go. Let's go. Come on.

562
00:32:36,792 --> 00:32:38,208
2050年

1341
00:32:36,892 --> 00:32:38,308
2050.

563
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:40,750
燕子灭绝了…那是什么？

1342
00:32:38,392 --> 00:32:40,850
The extinction of the swallow... Is that a thing?

564
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,750
整个生态系统都完蛋了

1343
00:32:40,933 --> 00:32:42,850
Completely screwed up the ecosystem.

565
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:45,208
喀拉喀托火山在2049年也爆发了

1344
00:32:42,933 --> 00:32:45,308
Krakatoa erupted in 2049 as well.

566
00:32:45,292 --> 00:32:46,500
没发现卡布路易

1345
00:32:45,392 --> 00:32:46,600
No Kablooie.

567
00:32:46,583 --> 00:32:49,083
天啊 坏事一件接一件 是不是？

1346
00:32:46,683 --> 00:32:49,183
God, it's just one damn thing after another, isn't it?

568
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:52,333
-飓风、饥荒、火山爆发、洪水… -找到了

1347
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:52,433
-Cyclone, famine, volcanoes, floods... -Got him.

569
00:32:55,083 --> 00:32:56,375
末日事件报告

1348
00:32:55,892 --> 00:32:58,808
-That's where he is. -MOBIUS: Alabama, 2050.

570
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:58,708
-他应该在这里 -阿拉巴马州 2050年

571
00:33:00,208 --> 00:33:02,833
我得当心你以后会抢了我的饭碗

1349
00:33:00,308 --> 00:33:02,933
You're gonna take my job if I'm not careful.

572
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:07,833
你想让我批准派出一支全副武装的小队…

1350
00:33:04,975 --> 00:33:07,933
You want me to approve deployment of a fully-armed task force to...

573
00:33:07,917 --> 00:33:09,958
-是的 -去时间犯可能的藏身处？

1351
00:33:08,017 --> 00:33:10,058
-Yeah. -...the Variant's potential hiding spot?

574
00:33:10,042 --> 00:33:11,833
阿拉巴马州黑文山 那是个自治市

1352
00:33:10,142 --> 00:33:11,933
Haven Hills, Alabama, corporate town

575
00:33:11,917 --> 00:33:14,208
属于罗克斯卡特 后来一场飓风将该市完全摧毁

1353
00:33:12,017 --> 00:33:14,308
owned by Roxxcart until it's wiped out by a hurricane.

576
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:15,792
那里的食物和补给充足

1354
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:15,892
All the food and supplies you need.

577
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:17,458
只要他愿意

1355
00:33:15,975 --> 00:33:17,558
If he likes it, there's no reason

578
00:33:17,542 --> 00:33:20,333
他就没有理由不回去 他可以把那里反复当作据点

1356
00:33:17,642 --> 00:33:20,433
he can't keep going back and just camping out, over and over.

579
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:22,625
而且这些理论都来自于

1357
00:33:20,517 --> 00:33:22,725
And this is all based on a theory from the Variant

580
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:25,667
-那个上次搞砸任务的时间犯？ -是的 他干得不错

1358
00:33:22,808 --> 00:33:25,767
-who just blew your previous mission? -Yeah, he's doing great.

581
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,417
莫比乌斯 作为你的朋友

1359
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,517
Mobius, as your friend,

582
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,625
我必须得告诉你 相信这个人可不明智

1360
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,725
I have to tell you that trusting this man is not a good idea.

583
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:32,625
我知道 但是也许值得一试

1361
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:32,725
No. I know. But maybe he's worth the trouble.

584
00:33:32,708 --> 00:33:34,667
他刚刚发现了咱们安保的巨大漏洞

1362
00:33:32,808 --> 00:33:34,767
He just uncovered a huge hole in our security.

585
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,292
我担心的就是这个

1363
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,392
That's what concerns me!

586
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:39,125
我能搞定他 相信我

1364
00:33:37,308 --> 00:33:39,225
I can handle him. Trust me.

587
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:40,750
我们要抓的人就在那里

1365
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:40,850
This is where we get our guy.

588
00:33:40,833 --> 00:33:42,417
我相信你 但是他

1366
00:33:40,933 --> 00:33:42,517
You, I trust, but him.

589
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,500
听着 拉沃娜 我的直觉告诉我

1367
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,600
Listen, Ravonna, every instinct is telling me

590
00:33:44,583 --> 00:33:46,417
在那里肯定能抓到这个时间犯

1368
00:33:44,683 --> 00:33:46,517
this is where we nail the Variant.

591
00:33:48,792 --> 00:33:51,333
批准吧 你从来没见我这么激动过 是不是？

1369
00:33:48,892 --> 00:33:51,433
Come on. You don't see me usually this worked up, right?

592
00:33:51,417 --> 00:33:53,000
我兴奋极了

1370
00:33:51,517 --> 00:33:53,100
I'm excited.

593
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:55,083
我都迫不及待了

1371
00:33:53,183 --> 00:33:55,183
I'm chomping at the bit.

594
00:33:57,125 --> 00:33:59,542
-好吧 -太好了

1372
00:33:57,225 --> 00:33:59,642
-Okay. -Yes. Okay.

595
00:33:59,625 --> 00:34:00,833
-但是 莫比乌斯 -是的？

1373
00:33:59,725 --> 00:34:00,933
-But, Mobius? -Yeah?

596
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:05,417
如果这次还是不行 我就帮不了你了

1374
00:34:02,892 --> 00:34:05,517
There's not much I can do if it doesn't work out.

597
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,875
永恒

1375
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,975
For all time.

598
00:34:06,958 --> 00:34:08,417
常相伴

1376
00:34:07,058 --> 00:34:08,517
Always.

599
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,583
好的

1377
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,683
Okay.

600
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:19,833
咱们出动

1378
00:34:18,558 --> 00:34:19,933
We're on.

601
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:25,458
咱们今天干得漂亮

1379
00:34:23,808 --> 00:34:25,558
We are doing some good work today.

602
00:34:25,542 --> 00:34:26,667
我也这么觉得

1380
00:34:25,642 --> 00:34:26,767
I thought so too.

603
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:29,333
我跟你说 你要是真能帮我们抓住这个时间犯

1381
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:29,433
I'm tellin' you. You actually help us catch this Variant,

604
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:30,958
也许吧 我的朋友

1382
00:34:29,517 --> 00:34:31,058
and who knows, my friend.

605
00:34:31,042 --> 00:34:33,750
怎么着 能让我和时间守护者见面吗？

1383
00:34:31,142 --> 00:34:33,850
What, good enough for a face-to-face with the Time-Keepers?

606
00:34:33,833 --> 00:34:34,833
我可没那么说

1384
00:34:33,933 --> 00:34:34,933
I didn't say that.

607
00:34:34,917 --> 00:34:37,333
-一步一步来吧 -好吧 一步一步来

1385
00:34:35,017 --> 00:34:37,433
-One step at a time. -All right. One step at a time.

608
00:34:37,417 --> 00:34:39,583
-以防万一 -太好了 这感觉让人…

1386
00:34:37,517 --> 00:34:39,683
-Just in case. -Yeah, don't those feel...

609
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:41,208
绝对不行

1387
00:34:39,767 --> 00:34:41,308
Absolutely not.

610
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,667
集合 准备任务简报

1388
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,767
Gather around for a briefing.

611
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,750
罗克斯卡特是个超大型超市 在那个时代很常见

1389
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,850
Roxxcart is a vast superstore common to the era.

612
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:53,333
整个建筑由许多分区组成

1390
00:34:50,725 --> 00:34:53,433
It consists of a series of sprawling sections,

613
00:34:53,417 --> 00:34:55,583
还有一个巨大的仓库

1391
00:34:53,517 --> 00:34:55,683
including a large warehouse.

614
00:34:55,667 --> 00:34:59,833
这个仓库在飓风期间变成了民众的避难所

1392
00:34:55,767 --> 00:34:59,933
This warehouse is being used by civilians as a shelter tryin' to ride out the storm.

615
00:34:59,917 --> 00:35:02,750
记住 这可是十级的末日事件

1393
00:35:00,017 --> 00:35:02,850
Remember, this is a class ten apocalypse.

616
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:04,833
虽然时间犯不知道我们会出现

1394
00:35:02,933 --> 00:35:04,933
While the Variant shouldn't know we're coming,

617
00:35:04,917 --> 00:35:07,833
但是他可能藏在任何地方 并且很可能发动攻击

1395
00:35:05,017 --> 00:35:07,933
he could be hiding anywhere and should be considered hostile.

618
00:35:07,917 --> 00:35:09,417
请务必保持警惕

1396
00:35:08,017 --> 00:35:09,517
So stay alert.

619
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,625
这个时间犯每次袭击后 都会偷走重置器

1397
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,725
Every time there is an attack, the Variant steals a reset charge.

620
00:35:13,708 --> 00:35:15,125
他肯定有所图谋

1398
00:35:13,808 --> 00:35:15,225
He's planning something.

621
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:16,542
只是我们还不知道

1399
00:35:15,308 --> 00:35:16,642
We just don't know what.

622
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:19,000
所以一定要留意那些重置器

1400
00:35:16,725 --> 00:35:19,100
So keep an eye out for the missing charges,

623
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:22,667
如果你看到洛基 直接裁剪

1401
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:22,767
and if you see a Loki, prune it.

624
00:35:24,167 --> 00:35:26,167
注意 是那个坏的洛基

1402
00:35:24,267 --> 00:35:26,267
The bad Loki, preferably.

625
00:35:30,542 --> 00:35:33,083
阿拉巴马州 黑文山

626
00:35:33,167 --> 00:35:35,208
罗克斯卡特出品

627
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:48,042
2050年

628
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:53,750
罗克斯卡特

629
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:57,792
有情况吗？

1403
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:57,892
Anything?

630
00:35:57,875 --> 00:36:00,083
暂时没有 出发！

1404
00:35:57,975 --> 00:36:00,183
Nothing yet. Move out!

631
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:21,667
这是怎么回事？

1405
00:36:20,475 --> 00:36:21,767
The hell was that?

632
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,625
我在用魔法烘干衣服

1406
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:26,725
That was me using magic to dry my clothes.

633
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:31,375
我又不是你们 每走一步都得大喊大叫的

1407
00:36:27,975 --> 00:36:31,475
So I don't announce myself with every squeaky footstep like the rest of you.

1408
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:36,683
HUNTER B-15: Take both teams and sweep the storm shelter.

634
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:36,583
带上两支队伍去搜查风暴避难所

635
00:36:36,667 --> 00:36:38,292
-遵命 长官 -洛基和我一起

1409
00:36:36,767 --> 00:36:38,392
-Yes, ma'am. -MOBIUS: Loki and I are gonna

636
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:40,125
去查看那个温室 咱们在那边…

1410
00:36:38,475 --> 00:36:40,142
check out the Green House. We'll meet...

637
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:42,250
-不行 -不行？

1411
00:36:40,225 --> 00:36:42,350
-No. -No?

638
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:44,167
你和D-90一起行动 他得跟着我

1412
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:44,267
You go with D-90. He stays with me.

639
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:46,292
你说什么… 我得全程监视着他

1413
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:46,392
What are you... He's under my supervision.

640
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:47,917
这次行动我说了算 莫比乌斯

1414
00:36:46,475 --> 00:36:48,017
This is my field op, Mobius.

641
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,542
-如果他不构成威胁 就没事… -他当然构成威胁

1415
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,642
-If he's not a threat, then... -Of course he's a threat.

642
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,250
-你还记得时间剧场吗？ -莫比乌斯…

1416
00:36:50,725 --> 00:36:52,267
-Remember the Time Theater? -Mobius...

643
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:54,833
-这就是为什么我需要他跟我一起 -你可以回时间变异管理局

1417
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,517
-I want him with me. -You are welcome to go back

1418
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,350
to the TVA and litigate with Renslayer, but right now...

644
00:36:54,917 --> 00:36:57,250
找洛斯蕾尔去提意见 但是现在…

645
00:36:57,333 --> 00:36:58,875
我们都到这里了 我们不会回去

1419
00:36:57,433 --> 00:36:58,975
We're here. We're not going back.

646
00:36:58,958 --> 00:37:01,750
-时间犯就在这里 -莫比乌斯 没关系的

1420
00:36:59,058 --> 00:37:01,850
-The Variant is here. -Mobius, it's fine. It's fine.

647
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:03,833
你可以相信我

1421
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:03,933
You can trust me.

648
00:37:05,042 --> 00:37:10,000
我明白 信任是需要争取的 我会努力的

1422
00:37:05,142 --> 00:37:10,100
I understand I have to earn that, so, I will.

649
00:37:13,083 --> 00:37:16,917
为什么那些根本不能信任的人 总是把“相信我”挂在嘴边上？

1423
00:37:13,183 --> 00:37:17,017
Why is it the people you can't trust are always saying, "Trust me"?

650
00:37:18,583 --> 00:37:20,833
好吧 这次得一直戴着时间项圈

1424
00:37:18,683 --> 00:37:20,933
Okay, try to hang on to your Time Collar this time.

651
00:37:20,917 --> 00:37:22,583
咱们在展厅见

1425
00:37:21,017 --> 00:37:22,683
We'll see you in the showroom.

652
00:37:58,708 --> 00:38:00,958
很高兴能和你在一起

1426
00:37:58,808 --> 00:38:01,058
I am glad we're getting to spend this time together.

653
00:38:01,042 --> 00:38:02,042
安静

1427
00:38:01,142 --> 00:38:02,142
- Quiet. -

654
00:38:02,125 --> 00:38:03,833
我想说咱们是不是走错了…

1428
00:38:02,225 --> 00:38:03,933
-I'm saying we got off on the wrong... -Shh.

655
00:38:15,833 --> 00:38:17,083
嘿!

1429
00:38:15,933 --> 00:38:17,183
HUNTER B-15: Hey!

656
00:38:17,167 --> 00:38:18,958
别激动

1430
00:38:17,267 --> 00:38:19,058
Whoa, whoa. It's okay. It's okay.

657
00:38:19,042 --> 00:38:20,458
你在干什么？

1431
00:38:19,142 --> 00:38:20,558
What are you doing?

658
00:38:20,542 --> 00:38:22,292
买绿植

1432
00:38:20,642 --> 00:38:22,392
Shopping for plants.

659
00:38:24,292 --> 00:38:25,583
在这个暴风天？

1433
00:38:24,392 --> 00:38:25,683
In this storm?

660
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:27,792
暴风天有特价

1434
00:38:26,475 --> 00:38:27,892
It's a hurricane sale.

661
00:38:27,875 --> 00:38:29,667
杜鹃花打五折

1435
00:38:27,975 --> 00:38:29,767
Azaleas are half off.

1436
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,642
Could that be you?

662
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:31,542
是你吗？

663
00:38:34,167 --> 00:38:38,250
我觉得 我可能会穿得更正式些 但是 没错 也许吧

1437
00:38:34,267 --> 00:38:38,350
I mean, I probably would have worn a suit, but, yes, maybe.

664
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:54,625
他死了吗？

1438
00:38:53,475 --> 00:38:54,725
Is he dead?

665
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:57,292
没有 一般都能活下来

1439
00:38:54,808 --> 00:38:57,392
No. They usually survive.

666
00:39:02,292 --> 00:39:07,667
所以你就是时间变异管理局找来 追捕我的那个笨蛋

1440
00:39:02,392 --> 00:39:07,767
So, you're the fool the TVA brought in to hunt me down.

667
00:39:11,208 --> 00:39:13,625
应该是我吧

1441
00:39:11,308 --> 00:39:13,725
Me, I presume.

668
00:39:13,708 --> 00:39:18,125
拜托 每个人都有身份 你就是我

1442
00:39:13,808 --> 00:39:18,225
Please. If anyone's anyone, you're me.

669
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,792
见到你真开心

1443
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,892
How nice to meet you.

670
00:39:24,875 --> 00:39:27,917
过去的一小时里 风力在增强

1444
00:39:24,975 --> 00:39:28,017
NEWS ANCHOR: For the past hour we have seen winds intensifying.

671
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,667
再说一遍 如果你刚看到 我们有两个...

1445
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,767
- Again, if you're just tuning in... -

672
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,958
检查一下包里有没有重置器

1446
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:33,058
HUNTER D-90: Check the bags for the reset charges.

673
00:39:33,042 --> 00:39:34,833
你们是联邦应急管理署的吗？

1447
00:39:33,142 --> 00:39:34,933
You guys FEMA?

674
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:35,958
还是国民警卫队？

1448
00:39:35,017 --> 00:39:36,058
National Guard?

675
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:37,917
可能是他们中的任何人

1449
00:39:36,725 --> 00:39:38,017
Could be any one of them.

676
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,333
如果你们有直升飞机或者其它交通工具

1450
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:41,433
Well, hey, if you got a 'copter or other transport,

677
00:39:41,417 --> 00:39:42,583
现在该派上用场了

1451
00:39:41,517 --> 00:39:42,683
now is the time to use it.

678
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:46,250
这里有女人和小孩 这天气可不是闹着玩的

1452
00:39:42,767 --> 00:39:46,350
We got women and kids, and that weather ain't playin'.

679
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:47,833
抱歉 我们没有

1453
00:39:46,433 --> 00:39:47,933
No, I'm sorry. We don't.

680
00:39:47,917 --> 00:39:49,750
那你们是怎么来的？

1454
00:39:48,017 --> 00:39:49,850
Well, how the heck did you get here?

681
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:53,667
你在干什么？

1455
00:39:52,767 --> 00:39:53,767
What are you doing?

682
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:56,833
你吓到他们了

1456
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:56,933
Hey! These people are scared.

683
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:00,250
他们快要死了 他们本来就应该害怕

1457
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:00,350
They're about to die. They should be scared.

684
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:01,625
但不是害怕我们

1458
00:40:00,433 --> 00:40:01,725
Okay. Not of us.

685
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:03,375
-先生 -别着急

1459
00:40:02,475 --> 00:40:03,475
-Sir! -Take it easy.

686
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:05,875
怎么了？

1460
00:40:04,725 --> 00:40:05,975
What is it?

687
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,792
这是真的 这是真的 这是真的

1461
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,892
HUNTER C-20:  It's real. It's real. It's real.

688
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:15,750
这是真的 这是真的 这是真的

1462
00:40:11,975 --> 00:40:15,850
It's real. It's real. It's real.

689
00:40:20,583 --> 00:40:22,333
附身这一招挺聪明

1463
00:40:20,683 --> 00:40:22,433
Enchantment is a clever trick.

690
00:40:22,417 --> 00:40:25,792
有点懦弱 有点业余 但是挺聪明

1464
00:40:22,517 --> 00:40:25,892
Cowardly, a bit amateur-ish, but clever.

691
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:29,458
和为时间变异管理局工作一样懦弱

1465
00:40:25,975 --> 00:40:29,558
Almost as cowardly as working for the TVA.

692
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:31,333
我是为我自己工作的

1466
00:40:30,225 --> 00:40:31,433
I'm working for me.

1467
00:40:31,558 --> 00:40:33,517
You really believe that, don't you?

693
00:40:32,292 --> 00:40:34,500
-你还真信了 是不是？ -对

1468
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,600
Yeah.

694
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:38,958
我还担心他们找到了一个更高等的我呢

1469
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:39,058
And here I was worried that they'd found a better version of me.

695
00:40:39,042 --> 00:40:41,208
你们是在找避难所吗？

1470
00:40:39,142 --> 00:40:41,308
Hi, are you guys looking for the disaster shelter?

696
00:40:41,292 --> 00:40:42,375
不是

1471
00:40:41,392 --> 00:40:42,475
No.

1472
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:57,100
THE VARIANT: Oh, bless.

697
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:57,000
老天保佑

698
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:01,083
你要向你那些小朋友求救吗？

1473
00:40:58,683 --> 00:41:02,058
Are you going to call your little friends for help?

699
00:41:12,625 --> 00:41:14,250
怎么了？

1474
00:41:12,725 --> 00:41:14,350
LOKI: What's the matter?

700
00:41:14,333 --> 00:41:16,792
你害怕和我面对面吗？

1475
00:41:14,433 --> 00:41:16,892
You too scared to meet me face-to-face?

701
00:41:17,833 --> 00:41:18,875
现身吧

1476
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:18,975
Show yourself.

702
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:23,417
得到他们的信任可不容易

1477
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:23,517
You know, gaining their confidence was no mean feat.

703
00:41:27,625 --> 00:41:29,667
我的天啊

1478
00:41:27,725 --> 00:41:29,767
Oh, my God.

704
00:41:30,958 --> 00:41:32,250
你是在卧底

1479
00:41:31,058 --> 00:41:32,350
You went undercover.

705
00:41:33,667 --> 00:41:36,500
如果你稍微收敛一下

1480
00:41:33,767 --> 00:41:36,600
If you could possibly sheathe your smarm for a moment,

706
00:41:36,583 --> 00:41:38,708
我就告诉你我来找你的原因

1481
00:41:36,683 --> 00:41:38,808
I have an offer for you. That's why I found you.

707
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:41,125
继续说

1482
00:41:40,142 --> 00:41:41,225
Go on.

708
00:41:43,208 --> 00:41:45,500
我要推翻时间守护者

1483
00:41:43,308 --> 00:41:45,600
I'm going to overthrow the Time-Keepers.

709
00:41:47,583 --> 00:41:50,625
我跟你摊牌

1484
00:41:47,683 --> 00:41:50,725
And, uh, cards on the table,

710
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:53,750
我需要一个合格的副官

1485
00:41:51,683 --> 00:41:53,850
I could use a qualified lieutenant.

711
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:59,083
我猜你说的是…我？

1486
00:41:56,183 --> 00:41:59,183
And I assume you mean... Me?

712
00:41:59,958 --> 00:42:01,292
你觉得呢

1487
00:42:00,058 --> 00:42:01,392
What say you...

713
00:42:03,042 --> 00:42:04,042
洛基？

1488
00:42:03,142 --> 00:42:04,142
Loki?

1489
00:42:04,267 --> 00:42:06,767
Ugh. Don't call me that.

714
00:42:05,333 --> 00:42:06,667
别那么叫我

715
00:42:07,833 --> 00:42:09,167
你可以叫我

1490
00:42:07,933 --> 00:42:09,267
You can call me...

716
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,500
兰迪

1491
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,600
Randy.

717
00:42:13,542 --> 00:42:15,875
天啊 我算明白为什么索尔 觉得这很烦了

1492
00:42:13,642 --> 00:42:15,975
God. Now I understand why Thor found this so annoying.

718
00:42:15,958 --> 00:42:18,625
别耍我了 我可是在帮你

1493
00:42:16,058 --> 00:42:18,725
Enough with your games. I've been trying to help you.

719
00:42:18,708 --> 00:42:21,417
在文艺复兴市集上 我可是帮你拖延了不少时间

1494
00:42:18,808 --> 00:42:21,517
I kept them vulnerable at the Renaissance Fair for some time.

720
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,500
天啊 太感谢你了

1495
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,600
Oh, gosh, and that was just so nice of you.

721
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:28,042
但是考虑了八到十秒以后

1496
00:42:23,683 --> 00:42:28,142
But after eight to ten seconds of consideration,

722
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:29,583
我的答案是否定的

1497
00:42:28,225 --> 00:42:29,683
the answer is no.

723
00:42:30,833 --> 00:42:33,917
我对统治时间变异管理局毫无兴趣

1498
00:42:30,933 --> 00:42:34,017
I'm not interested in ruling the Time Variance Authority.

724
00:42:40,083 --> 00:42:42,000
这是真的 这是真的

1499
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:42,100
HUNTER C-20: It's real. It's real.

725
00:42:42,083 --> 00:42:44,125
这是真的 这是真的

1500
00:42:42,183 --> 00:42:44,225
It was real. It was real.

726
00:42:44,208 --> 00:42:45,833
-什么是真的？什么... -这是真的

1501
00:42:44,308 --> 00:42:45,933
-What's real? What's... -It's real.

727
00:42:45,917 --> 00:42:47,542
-她疯了 -这是真的

1502
00:42:46,017 --> 00:42:47,642
-She's off the dial. -It's real.

728
00:42:47,625 --> 00:42:49,458
-看着我 -这是真的

1503
00:42:47,725 --> 00:42:49,558
-MOBIUS: Look at me. -It's real.

729
00:42:49,542 --> 00:42:50,542
我想回家

1504
00:42:49,642 --> 00:42:50,642
I wanna go home.

730
00:42:51,208 --> 00:42:52,583
我们会带你回家

1505
00:42:51,308 --> 00:42:52,683
We're gonna get you there.

731
00:42:53,583 --> 00:42:55,292
呼叫时间变异管理局 通知医务室

1506
00:42:53,683 --> 00:42:55,392
Call the TVA, let the infirmary know...

732
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:57,333
不不不 我说出去了

1507
00:42:55,475 --> 00:42:57,433
No, no, no. I gave it away.

733
00:42:58,625 --> 00:43:00,583
-我说出去了 -你说出去什么了？

1508
00:42:58,725 --> 00:43:00,683
-I gave it away. -What did you give away...

734
00:43:00,667 --> 00:43:02,500
时间守护者 他们的位置

1509
00:43:00,767 --> 00:43:02,600
The Time-Keepers, where they are.

735
00:43:03,833 --> 00:43:06,083
我把找到他们的方法说出去了

1510
00:43:03,975 --> 00:43:06,183
I gave it away how to find them.

736
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:09,250
B-15 你那边情况如何？

1511
00:43:07,683 --> 00:43:09,350
B-15, what is your status?

737
00:43:11,042 --> 00:43:14,375
B-15 请回话 你那边什么情况？

1512
00:43:11,142 --> 00:43:14,475
B-15, come in. What's your status?

738
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,333
B-15 你能听到吗？

1513
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,433
B-15, do you copy?

739
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:36,750
如果你不想统治时间变异管理局 那你想干什么？

1514
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:36,850
If you don't wanna rule the TVA, then what do you want?

740
00:43:36,833 --> 00:43:38,542
这不重要 你来得太晚了

1515
00:43:36,933 --> 00:43:38,642
It doesn't matter. You're too late.

741
00:43:38,625 --> 00:43:40,667
你会发现我永远是抢占先机的

1516
00:43:38,725 --> 00:43:40,767
I think you'll find I'm well ahead of schedule.

742
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,500
我就是这样找到你的藏身之处的

1517
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:42,600
I found your hiding place like that.

743
00:43:42,583 --> 00:43:45,333
我觉得我才是更高等的洛基 你说呢？

1518
00:43:42,683 --> 00:43:45,433
I'd say that makes me the superior Loki, wouldn't you?

1519
00:43:46,725 --> 00:43:50,142
I see. That's your plan.

744
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:50,042
我明白了 那是你的计划

745
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:53,333
把我们引到这里 然后炸掉这个地方

1520
00:43:50,225 --> 00:43:53,433
Lure us all here so you can blow the place up.

746
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,583
我想念兰迪

1521
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,683
I miss Randy.

747
00:44:09,708 --> 00:44:12,083
谢谢你帮我拖延时间

1522
00:44:09,808 --> 00:44:12,183
Thank you for helping me stall for time.

748
00:44:12,167 --> 00:44:14,333
你真的很喜欢自说自话

1523
00:44:12,267 --> 00:44:14,433
You really do love to hear yourself talk.

1524
00:44:14,558 --> 00:44:17,183
You're the first person to tell me that.

749
00:44:15,375 --> 00:44:17,083
以前还没人跟我这么说过

750
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:24,500
我永远也不会这样对待自己

1525
00:44:22,933 --> 00:44:24,600
I would never treat me like this.

751
00:44:25,375 --> 00:44:26,375
你好

1526
00:44:25,475 --> 00:44:26,475
Hi.

752
00:44:35,292 --> 00:44:37,500
来吧 别藏着了

1527
00:44:35,392 --> 00:44:37,600
Oh, come on. Stop hiding.

753
00:44:51,875 --> 00:44:55,042
洛基 你要是还要脸 就自己来和我打

1528
00:44:51,975 --> 00:44:55,142
Loki, if you had any honor you'd fight me as yourself.

754
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:56,500
我忙着呢

1529
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:56,600
I have shit to do.

755
00:44:56,583 --> 00:44:57,958
够了

1530
00:44:56,683 --> 00:44:58,058
Enough!

756
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,375
-莫比乌斯 -他在哪？

1531
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,475
-HUNTER B-15: Mobius. -Where is he?

757
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:13,167
-我跟丢了 -发生了什么？

1532
00:45:11,558 --> 00:45:13,267
-I lost him. -What happened?

758
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:14,292
我...

1533
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:14,392
I...

759
00:45:14,375 --> 00:45:16,250
看来你心爱的洛基背叛了你

1534
00:45:14,475 --> 00:45:16,350
Looks like your favorite Loki betrayed you.

760
00:45:16,333 --> 00:45:17,417
快点行动

1535
00:45:16,433 --> 00:45:17,517
MOBIUS: Just move!

761
00:45:42,875 --> 00:45:44,875
你想从我这得到什么？

1536
00:45:42,975 --> 00:45:44,975
What do you want from me?

762
00:45:44,958 --> 00:45:46,250
这是怎么回事？

1537
00:45:45,058 --> 00:45:46,350
What is this about?

763
00:45:51,208 --> 00:45:53,625
做好心理准备吧 洛基

1538
00:45:51,308 --> 00:45:53,725
THE VARIANT: Brace yourself, Loki.

1539
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:00,725
LOKI:  What do you want from me?

764
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,625
你想从我这得到什么？

765
00:46:00,708 --> 00:46:02,417
你想从我这得到什么？

1540
00:46:00,808 --> 00:46:02,517
What do you want from me?

766
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,208
你想从我这得到什么？

1541
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,308
What do you want from me?

767
00:46:04,292 --> 00:46:05,542
这是怎么回事？

1542
00:46:04,392 --> 00:46:05,642
What is this about?

768
00:46:05,625 --> 00:46:06,917
你想从我这得到什么？

1543
00:46:05,725 --> 00:46:07,017
What do you want from me?

769
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,083
这是怎么回事？

1544
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,183
What is this about?

770
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:11,458
你想从我这得到什么？

1545
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:11,558
What do you want from me?

771
00:46:11,542 --> 00:46:13,125
你想从我这得到什么？

1546
00:46:11,642 --> 00:46:13,225
What do you want from me?

772
00:46:13,208 --> 00:46:14,958
这是怎么回事？

1547
00:46:13,308 --> 00:46:15,058
What is this about?

773
00:46:15,042 --> 00:46:17,292
这是怎么回事？

1548
00:46:15,142 --> 00:46:17,392
What is this about?

774
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:19,250
这和你没关系

1549
00:46:17,475 --> 00:46:19,350
This isn't about you.

775
00:46:22,542 --> 00:46:23,667
没错

1550
00:46:22,642 --> 00:46:23,767
Right.

776
00:46:24,667 --> 00:46:27,208
启动

777
00:46:31,542 --> 00:46:35,958
正在初始化

778
00:46:58,042 --> 00:46:59,250
它们去哪了？

1551
00:46:58,142 --> 00:46:59,350
Where they going?

779
00:47:05,375 --> 00:47:06,792
这不可能

1552
00:47:05,475 --> 00:47:06,892
That's not possible.

780
00:47:10,667 --> 00:47:15,083
我是分析师1182-E 报告代码000

1553
00:47:10,767 --> 00:47:15,183
This is Analyst 1182-E, uh, reporting a code, uh, 000.

781
00:47:15,167 --> 00:47:17,208
时间分支正在快速形成 斜率...

1554
00:47:15,267 --> 00:47:17,308
Branches rapidly forming at a slope...

782
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:19,333
有人攻击了神圣时间线

1555
00:47:17,392 --> 00:47:19,433
Somebody just bombed the Sacred Timeline.

783
00:48:07,833 --> 00:48:09,292
洛基

1556
00:48:07,933 --> 00:48:09,392
MOBIUS: Loki!

784
00:48:10,625 --> 00:48:11,833
洛基 等等

1557
00:48:10,725 --> 00:48:11,933
Loki, wait!

785
00:48:11,917 --> 00:48:14,208
等等 洛基 等等

1558
00:48:12,017 --> 00:48:14,308
Wait! Loki, wait!

786
00:48:17,792 --> 00:48:19,458
不要 等等 洛基

1559
00:48:17,892 --> 00:48:19,558
No! Wait, Loki!

787
00:48:20,958 --> 00:48:21,958
该死

1560
00:48:21,058 --> 00:48:22,058
Damn it!
