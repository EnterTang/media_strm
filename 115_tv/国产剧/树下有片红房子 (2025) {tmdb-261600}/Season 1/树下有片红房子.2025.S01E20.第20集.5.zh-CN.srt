1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,500
S01E20 挽救房子
S01E20  Be a man

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:06,300
杰森:我还是认为在我们去看你的父母之前应该先打个电话给他们.
Jason: I still think we should call first before we go all the way on the bus to see your folks.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,400
麦琪:杰森,他们就会说让我们不要去.
Maggie: Jason, they'd just tell us not to come.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,000
迈克:哦,来吧,我来帮你弄那些东西吧,爸爸.
Mike: Oh, here, let me get all those for you, dad.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,400
麦琪:开萝尔宝贝,我们差不多好了.
Maggie: Carol honey, we are almost ready.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,100
开萝尔:你是在和我说话吗?可谁也没跟我说制定了这个旅行计划.
Carol: Were you speaking to me? No one spoke to me when this trip was being planned.

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:28,300
麦琪:宝贝,直到昨天晚上我们还不知道我们是否要去.开萝尔,我们担心你的外公外婆.
Maggie: Honey, we didn't know we were going until last night. Carol, we are worried about grandpa and grandma.

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,200
杰森:噢,麦琪,我想你太过担心了.
Jason: oh, Maggie, I think you are overreacting.

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:37,200
麦琪:为什么他们直到最后一刻才取消到这儿的旅行?为什么爸爸说一切都很顺利呢?
Maggie: Then why did they call to cancel the trip at the last minute? And why did my dad say everything was swell?

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,000
杰森:啊……那是因为确实一切都很顺利.
Jason: Ah&amp;amp;because it is.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,400
麦琪:不,杰森,我父亲不用类似"顺利","好","不错"这样的词.
Maggie: No, Jason, my father doesn't use words like 'swell', 'good' or 'nice'...

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,300
杰森:当然不会说了,如果我也闷在家里的话.
Jason: Certainly not when I'm in the room.

13
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,600
本:我们走,我们走,我们走!
Ben: Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,000
麦琪:你怎么这么兴奋,本?
Maggie: Well you sure are excited about this, Ben?

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,500
本:你开玩笑吧?外公会让我玩他的荧光棒,他的手铐,甚至还会让我戴他的徽章.
Ben: Are you kidding? Grandpa is going to let me use his night stick, and his handcuffs, and even wear his badge.

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,600
杰森:嘿,可能还让你留指纹呢.
Jason: Hey, maybe you'll get finger printed, too.

17
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,600
本:噢!
Ben: Wow!

18
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:17,600
迈克:噢,爸爸,再次谢谢你让我留在家里帮塞克斯先生的草地施肥挣点钱.当然我认为挣钱能帮助我尊敬金钱,帮助我长大成人.
Mike: Well, Dad, again I just want to thank you for letting me stay home and earn some extra money helping Mr. Sacks fertilize his lawn. I am sure that earning money will teach me a new respect for the dollar, and help me grow as a person.

19
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,300
杰森:你肯定会精通如何施肥的.
Jason: But you'll be pretty good at spreading manure too.

20
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:28,300
迈克:很遗憾,说实在的,我错过了围在外婆的钢琴边听她唱歌的机会.
Mike: I'm so sorry that I'm gonna miss that sing along around grandma's piano.

21
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:36,700
杰森:对!记住孩子,如果你有什么问题就给隔壁的库斯曼家打电话.只能留一个客人过夜.
Jason: Well, just remember if you have any problems you can call the Crusons next door. And only one guest stays over tonight.

22
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:49,100
开萝尔:这不公平.没人关心我开萝尔有没有别的计划.在这个家里没人把我当作真正的活人看待.
Carol: This is not fair. No one thought that old Carol might have other plans.  No one in this entire house treated me as a real living breathing human person.

23
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:56,200
麦琪:开萝尔,上车.再见,宝贝.哦,还有迈克,我知道一切都会顺利,
Maggie: Carol, get in the car. Bye, sweetheart. Oh and Mike, I know everything will be fine,

24
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,600
因为如果有什么事……我们会一直关你到35岁.
because if it is...you'll be grounded until you are 35.

25
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,100
迈克:都说了几遍了.再见妈妈,再见爸爸.
Mike: Enough said.  Bye mom, bye dad.

26
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,800
杰森:明天见,迈克.
Jason: See you tomorrow Mike.

27
00:02:04,800 --> 00:03:13,100
迈克:好,再见……耶!
Mike: Alright, bye-bye ....Yeah!

28
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,900
麦琪:本,等等我们.
Maggie: Ben, wait for us.

29
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,700
本:我要去洗手间.
Ben: I got to go to the bathroom.

30
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,000
麦琪:我们想一起给外公外婆一个惊喜.
Maggie: We want to surprise grandpa and grandma together.

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,300
本:如果外公在我走之前搜我的身,我一定能让他惊喜.
Ben: If grandpa starts frisking to me before I go, I will surprise him all right.

32
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,600
麦琪:嘿.
Maggie: Hi.

33
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,700
一对夫妇:嘿.
A couple: Hi.

34
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,300
麦琪:我是埃德和凯特的女儿麦琪.
Maggie: I'm Ed and Kate's daughter, Maggie.

35
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,800
男人:哦好.对不起……
Man: Oh good. Excuse us..

36
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,200
麦琪:啊……你们就这样子走进去吗?
Maggie: Ah... should you just walk in like that?

37
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,200
男人:哦,难道让我们敲门,然后在冷风里等某个混蛋来开门?
Man: Well, we should knock, stand out here in the cold, waiting for some jerk to open the door?

38
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,700
麦琪:别这样.
Maggie: Come on.

39
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:57,300
杰森:他们是谁?
Jason: Who are they?

40
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:04,700
开萝尔:妈妈,这些人就是你不给他们送圣诞卡片的亲戚吗?我去找外公外婆了.
Carol: Mom, are these people the relatives you don't send Christmas cards to? I'm gonna try to find grandma and grandpa.

41
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:17,700
生意人:哈,乡亲们进来吧.哦你们把行李也拿来了.别担心,我们在晚饭前能谈好生意的.孩子们也来了.那太好了.来杯鸡尾酒弗兰克?
Salesman: ha, hiya folks come in. Oh I see you brought your luggage. Well don't worry, we'll try and close this deal by nightfall. The kiddies too. This is so nice. Cocktail Frank?

42
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,000
本:我不叫弗兰克.
Ben: My name is not Frank.

43
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
麦琪:你是谁?
Maggie: Who are you?

44
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
男人:我是谁?
Man: Who am I?

45
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,800
麦琪:我不认识你,也不认识他.
Maggie: I don't know you, I don't know him.

46
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,400
生意人:哈里·皮特,美国梦化为现实公司.
Salesman: Harry Dimbo, Great American-dream realty company

47
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,500
麦琪:这个房子要卖掉吗?
Maggie: This house is for sale?

48
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,500
生意人:是的.
Salesman: Yes.

49
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,300
麦琪:但……房主在哪?
Maggie: But.. where are the owners?

50
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:41,800
生意人:哦,卖主是不会露面的.特别是花了三十年造房子的房主.这会让他们心碎的.
Salesman: Oh, the sellers are never present for the showing. Especially sellers who have put thirty years into a place. This would break their heart.

51
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,500
麦琪:是的.
Maggie: I'm sure.

52
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,000
杰森:哦,亲爱的,这房子还没卖掉呢.
Jason: Well, honey they haven't sold it yet.

53
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
生意人:你们对这个房子感兴趣吗?
Salesman: You folks are interested in this house?

54
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,200
麦琪:很感兴趣.
Maggie: Deeply.

55
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,000
生意人:哦,让我来指出这个不朽杰作的几个突出优点.
Salesman: Oh, Let me point out some fine features of this timeless classic.

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,400
麦琪:你那样做的话我会哭的.
Maggie: If you do. I'm going to cry.

57
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,200
生意人:你说什么?
Salesman: Pardon?

58
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,100
杰森:嗯,他们为什么要卖这房子?
Jason: en. Why are they selling?

59
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,800
生意人:你们对这房子的特点不感兴趣吗?
Salesman: you are not interested in hearing about the house?

60
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:13,600
麦琪:我爱这房子,我就在这个火炉边做功课,等我爸爸回家把他的枪挂好然后过来抱我.
Maggie: I love this house, I do my homework right by this fireplace waiting for my daddy to come home and hang up his gun and give a hug.

61
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,400
杰森:他们为什么要卖这房子?
Jason: Why are they selling?

62
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:25,400
生意人:哦,别人的秘密我不能随便说,但我简单地告诉你们,靠退休收入,又贷了款,还遭了难而且……
Salesman: Oh, well, I can't really violate their confidence, but I will say, retirement income, a loan payment, disaster&amp;amp;

63
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,300
麦琪:哦.
Maggie: Oh.

64
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,000
杰森:没事,我是她的心理医生.
Jason: Its alright, I'm her psychiatrist.

65
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,300
生意人:哦,有什么我帮得上的吗?
Salesman: Oh, well, can I do anything?

66
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,700
杰森:是的,你就让我们单独呆一会,谢谢你.
Jason: Yes, you can just give us a moment alone please, thank you.

67
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,100
杰森:好了,麦琪,亲爱的.行了,我们想想看这件事.
Jason: Come on, Maggie, sweetheart. Come on, we'll look into this.

68
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,400
麦琪:卖掉这房子会上伤了他们的心.
Maggie: Selling this house has to be breaking their hearts.

69
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,400
杰森:我知道.为什么他们不来找我们呢?
Jason: I know. Why didn't they come to us for help?

70
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:51,200
麦琪:哦,我爸爸的自尊心很强,他怎么会开口向我们要钱呢?他对你谋生的工作有想法.
Maggie: Oh, my father's pride. There's no way he could ask us for money knowing the way he feels about what you do for a living.

71
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,100
杰森:你说什么?
Jason: What?

72
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,300
麦琪:没什么,我随便说的.
Maggie: Forget, I said that.

73
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,100
杰森:我知道他不太喜欢我,但我没想到他还讨厌我的工作.
Jason: I knew he didn't care for me, I didn't think he even hated my entire profession.

74
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:04,200
麦琪:哦,亲爱的,他并不是讨厌你的工作,他只是不了解你的工作是什么.
Maggie: Oh, honey, it's not that he hates your profession, it's just that he doesn't know what it is.

75
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,300
杰森:哦,那么17年后我才知道这些……
Jason: Oh, so now after 17 years I find this out...

76
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:13,300
麦琪:我告诉你他认为你是个江湖医生有什么好处呢?
Maggie: Now what good would it have done to let you know he thinks you are a quack?

77
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,100
杰森:江湖医生?
Jason: A quack?

78
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:22,700
麦琪:杰森,我们以后再谈这个好吗?现在我想在和爸爸妈妈见面以前不能让这房子卖掉.
Maggie: Jason, can we talk about this later? Now I don't want this house sold until we get a chance to talk to mom and dad.

79
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,000
杰森:对,对.
Jason: Sure, sure.

80
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,500
生意人:真正的双层板条,密封牢固,真正的窄立柱.
Salesman: Genuine lacken plaster, on real two by four studs.

81
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:43,900
杰森:对不起,我不是有意打断你,哈里,你刚才说的我没怎么听清楚.那么是在这间房间还是在整个房子里发现碎尸的呢?
Jason: Excuse me, I don't mean to interrupt you, Harry. What you were saying over there confused me. Were the victim's bodies found in this room or all through the house?

82
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:49,600
门铃响了.
The door bell rang.

83
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,700
鲍纳:生活就应该这样.
Boner: This is life as it should be.

84
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:56,800
贝迪:迈克,迈克!
Betti: Mike, Mike!

85
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:04,300
迈克:(喊叫)……伙计,棒极了.你们过得怎样?你们太早了……我还没定比萨呢.
Mike: (shouted)&amp;amp;  Man that was good. Guys how you doing? You're early and  I haven't got pizza yet.

86
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,500
贝迪:我来,我表哥格斯在比萨店工作.我能打个折.
Betti: Let me do it. My cousin Gus works for Paradise pizza. I can get us a discount.

87
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,300
迈克:好的.
Mike: All right.

88
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,700
鲍纳:那么,迈可,我们怎么过?
Boner: So, Mike, what's the action?

89
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:14,100
迈克:随便,随便,我们吃着比萨看会电视.
Mike: Not much, not much. Eat a little pizza and watch a little TV.

90
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:21,600
鲍纳:看电视?迈克,家里没其他人,这是个生活中难得的的机会,你就只想看电视?
Boner: TV? Mike, your folks aren't home, This is a chance of life time and you wanna watch TV?

91
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,500
迈克:电视已经开始了.
Mike: It's already started.

92
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:31,000
鲍纳:迈克,你怎么能对电视这么……呃……哦,几时安的有线电视?
Boner: Mike, what could be so important&amp;amp;.. Wah&amp;amp; so, when did you get cable?

93
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,200
贝迪:好极了.格斯表哥说比萨不要钱.
Betti: This is great. Gus is going to let us have the pizzas for nothing.

94
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,100
迈克:太好了!
Mike: All right!

95
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,300
贝迪:但是他下班要带几个朋友一块来.
Betti: If he and a couple of friends can stop by after work?

96
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,600
迈克:你知道有几个人?因为我想人不能太多……
Mike: You know how many? Because I don't think we should have more.

97
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,200
贝迪:他说有女的……
Betti: Imagine women..

98
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:57,600
迈克:哦,好吧.
Mike: All right.

99
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:02,600
开萝尔:剩下的旅途也这么充满乐趣吗?
Carol: Is the rest of the trip going to be this much fun?

100
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,600
麦琪:开萝尔,你为什么不和本一起去外公房里看电视呢?
Maggie: Carol, why don't you and Ben go watching TV in grandpa's den?

101
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,700
本:太棒了!
Ben: Great!

102
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,600
开萝尔:当然了,对你来说当然好了;有我陪着消磨时间.
Carol: Sure, It's great for you; you get to spend time with me.

103
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,500
杰森:本,你别动你外公的任何警察装备.
Jason: Ben, don't you go touching any of your grandpa's police staff.

104
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,800
本:你知道我的.
Ben: You know me.

105
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,100
麦琪:杰森,我们要帮帮他们.
Maggie: Jason, we got to help them.

106
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:23,900
杰森:我不知道你的父亲是否想要我们帮忙.再说我懂些什么?我只不过是个得到证书的江湖医生.
Jason: I'm not so sure your dad wants our help. Then again what do I know? I'm just a licensed quack.

107
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,000
麦琪:哦,杰森.
Maggie: Oh, Jason.

108
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,500
外公:不许动小子!
Grandpa: Freeze slime bag!

109
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,900
麦琪:爸爸!
Maggie: Daddy!

110
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:32,700
外婆:埃德,你差点打到杰森!
Grandma: Ed, you almost shot Jason!

111
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:38,500
外公:哦,他们不应该在这儿!呃……谁也不应该在这儿.
Grandpa: Well, they are not supposed to be here! Eh.., no one's supposed to be here.

112
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,000
麦琪:哦,妈妈,你还好吧?见到你真高兴!
Maggie: Oh, mom, how are you? It's so good to see you!

113
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,300

Grandpa: Pumpkin!

118
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,700
麦琪:你要卖房子这到底是怎么回事呢?
Maggie:  So what's this about selling the house?

119
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:07,500
外公:哦,这个,我们打算退休以后就卖.然后搬到一个小地方居住这样可以节省一些.
Grandpa: oh, well, we thought we'd do this retirement thing right.  Move into a smaller place with less up keep.

120
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,800
外婆:住公寓.

外公:那是本吗?
Grandpa: Is that Benni?

128
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,900
麦琪:对!
Maggie: Yeah!

129
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,800
外公:好啦!举起双手然后进来.
Grandpa: All right! Come out with your hands up!

130
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:37,200
本:我没法举,开萝尔把我铐在椅子上了.
Ben: I can't. Carol handcuffed me to the chair!

131
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,800
外公:哈!守着门;我来收拾他.
Grandpa: ha! Watch the door; I'm gonna rough him up.

麦琪:哦,我们歇会吧,该去弄晚饭了.来吧,本,.让你爸爸和外公说会话.
Maggie: Oh, we're going to stop and fix a little dinner, come on, Ben. Let your dad and granddad talk.

134
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:52,700
外公:哦,我想没那个必要.
Grandpa: Oh, I don't think that'll be necessary.

135
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,600
杰森:不,他可以在这里玩.
Jason: No, he can play here.

136
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,700
麦琪:来吧,本,你帮着削土豆皮.
Maggie: Come on, Ben, you can peel potatoes with the other persons.

137
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:08,800
本:哦.
Ben: Wow

138
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,200
麦琪:爸爸,如果你和妈妈有经济问题的话,我们会……
Maggie: Daddy, if you and mom are having financial problems we would be

139
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,800
外公:不,我们有.很好,一切都很顺利.
Grandpa: No, they're swell. It's well, fine, even good.

140
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,000
麦琪:爸爸,不管你需要多少钱,我和杰森都很高兴…
Maggie: Dad, any money you need, Jason and I would be more than happy

141
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:35,400
外公:麦琪,你忘记了吗我的小女儿,我供你住供你吃足足有18年,直到他来了把你带走.
Grandpa: Maggie, just in case you can't remember little girl, I kept a roof over your head and food on the table for over 18 years, till he came along anyway.

142
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,500
麦琪:爸爸!
Maggie: Daddy!

143
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:41,300
外公:不要说了.我现在不靠你们的施舍还能够养活你妈妈和我自己.
Grandpa: Damn it I can still take care of your mom and myself without your charity.

144
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:48,000
杰森:爸爸,爸爸,你没理由拒绝我们的帮助,就因为你对我有些看法.
Jason: Dad, dad, please! It's no reason for you to turn down this offer just because how you feel about me.

145
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,200
麦琪:杰森,你不要提……
Maggie: Jason, let's not mention&amp;amp;

146
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:59,700
杰森:不,不.你爸爸应该克服对我的看法,它应该保住这房子.为什么因为这愚蠢的自尊心而伤老伴,女儿和你自己的心?
Jason: No, no. Your dad should overcome his feelings about me and save this house. Why hurt your wife, your daughter and yourself all in the name of some foolish pride.

147
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:12,400
外公:愚蠢!别用江湖医生那套话来跟我说!告诉你除非我死了,否则我不会收你一个子儿!
Grandpa: Foolish! Don't use your shrink talk on me! The day I accept one dime of your money  will be the day they bury me.

148
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:27,100
杰森:进展很顺利,是吗?
Jason: I think that went well, don't you?

149
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:34,600
男孩:是的,杰瑞,听着,告诉布鲁斯,罗宾汉55号现在正在开派对.
Boy: Yeah, Jerry, listen. Call Bruce Vineger, tell him the party's at central 15, Robinhood lane.

150
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:40,500
迈克:啊,对不起,你叫懒虫是吗?我认为不应该再请更多的人了.
Mike: Ah, excuse me. Slug is it? I don't think we should invite any more people.

151
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:47,400
男孩:跟你有什么关系?你没听见吗?那个住在这儿的家伙,他父母去外地了.
Boy: What's up to you? Didn't you hear? The bozo who lives heres, parents are out of town.

152
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,900
迈克:家伙?嘿,听着.

Girl: Hi, Mike. Remember me? Linda mcmannis, We were in Karate class together.

154
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,900

Mike: Yeah, yeah, of course I remember you. You have got killer hands. Ah, I mean, I mean&amp;amp;

155
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,200
女孩:我知道你的意思.
Girl: I know what you mean.

156
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,900
贝迪:迈克,到这里来.
Betti: Mike, come here.

157
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,500
迈克:请允许我失陪一秒.
Mike: could you excuse me just a second?

158
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,300
女孩:好的.就一秒.
Girl: OK. just for a second.

159
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:16,200
贝迪:迈克,有两个家伙在后院呕吐,还有一个在楼上刮胡子呢.
Betti: Michel, there are two guys out back throwing up and one upstairs is shaving.This has

160
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,800
这可是我参加过的最酷的宴会了.
got to be the coolest party I have ever been to.

161
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,700
迈克:刮胡子?
Mike: Shaving?

162
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,300
贝迪:迈克,我需要几块钱,你妈妈的车子没油了.
Betti: Mike, I need a couple of bucks, your mom's car ran out of gas.

163
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,400
迈克:嘿,你不能用我妈妈的车.
Mike: hey, you can't take my mom's car.

164
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,000
贝迪:不是我,是弗兰克.
Betti: I didn't, Frank did.

165
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
迈克:弗兰克是谁?
Mike: Who's Frank?

166
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,300
贝迪:我还以为你认识他.
Betti: I thought you knew him.

167
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,300
迈克:不认识.
Mike: No.

168
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:40,500
贝迪:听着.格斯送比萨的车子发动不起来了,,所以他打电话给弗兰克叫他开车去拿我们的比萨,既然是免费的就让我们帮忙送几批货.
Betti: All right. Gus's pizza- mobile wouldn't start, so he calls Frank and say's we're gonna have to pick up our own pizzas and since they are free could we make a couple of deliveries.

169
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,400
迈克:用我妈妈的车?
Mike: In my mom's car?

170
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,600
贝迪:那你叫弗兰克怎么做?
Betti: What was Frank supposed to do?

171
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,900
迈克:那么弗兰克应该怎么做?
Mike: What was Frank supposed to do?

172
00:12:46,900 --> 00:13:10,100
贝迪:所有的事都在掌控之中.你就给点汽油钱吧.
Betti: Everything is under control. Now just give me a little gas money.

173
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,900
麦琪:妈妈,你就叫爸爸拿这笔钱吧.这也是你的家.
Maggie: Mom, make dad take the money. It's your home too.

174
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:20,400
外婆:哦,这个家是你爸爸是主人,在婚礼那天我保证过,要爱他,敬他,服从他.
Grandma: Well, your father's the boss, and on our wedding day I promised to love, honour and obey.

175
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:25,600
麦琪:哦,妈妈,妈妈.每个现代女性都知道服从只是口头上说说的.
Maggie: Oh, mom, mom. Every modern woman knows obey is just a figure of speech.

176
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,700
外婆:也许那就是为什么现在每个现代女性似乎都想离婚的原因.
Grandma: Maybe that's why every modern womon seems to get divorced.

177
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,700
杰森:凯特,孩子们围在钢琴边等着你唱首歌呢.
Jason: Kate either the kids are glued to the piano or they're waiting for one of your songs.

178
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:40,000
外婆:哦,好的,我刚刚弄到一首音乐"像个处女".
Grandma: Oh, good. I just got the sheet music to like a virgin

179
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,800
杰森:事实上他们不是粘在那儿,他们全被铐起来了.
Jason: Actually they are not glued, they are handcuffed.

180
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,500
麦琪:哦,杰森,我跟妈妈说不通.得靠我们两个了,你说我们该怎么做?
Maggie: Oh, Jason, I got no where with my mother, It's up to us, what are we gonna do?

181
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,000
杰森:我们该怎么做?我完全没有一点主意.
Jason: What are we gonna do? I don't have the slightest idea.

182
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,100
麦琪:我们不能让他们把房子卖掉.杰森,他们所需要的就是六千美元.
Maggie: We can't let them lose their home. Jason, all they need is six thousand dollars.

183
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,400
杰森:如果我说错了你可以纠正我,但我们不是愿意给你父亲钱吗?
Jason: Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't we just offer your father money?

184
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:04,100
麦琪:你就因为他说了他宁愿去死也不要你给他的钱你就放弃了吗?
Maggie: and you're giving up just because he said he's rather be dead?

185
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,800
杰森:原谅我,那我该怎么办?
Jason: Forgive me, what was I thinking?

186
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,300
麦琪:好吧,你的计划是什么?
Maggie: OK, so what's your plan?

187
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,500
杰森:我没有什么计划.
Jason: I don't have a plan.

188
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:42,800
麦琪:你认为没有任何计划就行动这样明智吗?
Maggie: Do you think it's wise to proceed without a plan?

189
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,000
女孩A:这张唱片我们刚听过.
Girl A: We've just heard this record.

190
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,800
女孩B:没关系.乐队应该马上就要过来了.
Girl B: That's OK, the band should be here any minute.

191
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,100
迈克:乐队?
Mike: Band?

192
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,900
迈克:鲍纳,这场派对已经完全失控了.
Mike: Boner, this party is completely out of control.

193
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,000
鲍纳:我知道,老兄,祝贺你!
Boner: I know man, congratulations!

194
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,500
迈克:我得想个办法停止这些,不然的话别人会说我太无能了.
Mike: I gotta do something to stop it without all these people thinking I'm a wimp

195
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:05,200
鲍纳:放松点,迈克,今晚是你创造派对历史记录的时机.
Boner: Relax, Mike. It's time to make party history.

196
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:40,800
迈克:对不起.这个给我好吗?
Mike: Excuse me. Mind if I cut in?

197
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:53,700
迈克:我已经风流过15年了.你好,警察局吗?对,我是甘地先生.是的,鲍勃·甘地.
Mike: At least I was cool for 15 years. Hello, police? Yeah, this is Mr. Ghandi. Yes, Bob Ghandi.

198
00:15:53,700 --> 00:16:08,700
是,我住在罗宾汉巷,而且我爱好和平.这里非常安静的街道,可有个派对闹得非常厉害,就在15号.对,
Yes, I'm a very peace loving man, and I'm living on Robinhood lane. It is a normally a very peaceful street, but tonight there is a very very big loud party in No.15. Yes, I believe it's the

199
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:16,600
那是希弗家,是难以相信,因为他们一向是爱好安静的.是的,
Seavor home. This is very hard to believe since they are such a loving, peaceful family, yes.

200
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:27,700
请你们务必好好对待希弗家一个叫迈克的小伙子,他可是个非常非常精神的孩子,我肯定这不是他的过失.
And please be going easy on the Seavor boy called Mike, he's a very very spiritual boy and none of this could possibly be his fault.

201
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,400
麦琪:还是忙音,我在想迈克会是在跟谁说电话呢?
Maggie: Still busy, I wonder who Mike could be talking to?

202
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,100
开萝尔:妈妈,过来到你了.
Carol: Mom, come and take your turn.

203
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:32,900
本:耶.
Ben: Yeah.

204
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,400
外婆:我做得对吗?
Grandma: Am I doing this right?

205
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,300
杰森:他在自己的房间里?
Jason: Is he in his den?

206
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,100
麦琪:对.
Maggie: Yeah.

207
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:43,200
杰森:好吧,麦琪.你让我拿出一个计划来的.
Jason: OK, Maggie. You are the one who wanted me to come up with a plan.

208
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,200
麦琪:你想怎么去做?
Maggie: What are you going to do?

209
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,300
杰森:我不知道.
Jason: I have no idea.

210
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,900
杰森:埃德?
Jason: Ed?

211
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,800
外公:你来提供另一个慈悲,对吗?
Grandpa: Come to make another generous offer, did you?

212
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:01,300
杰森:你准备好了来个断然拒绝?
Jason: Ready for another gracious turn down?

213
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:11,200
杰森:我并不是想提什么建议埃德,除了道歉.给.
Jason: Now I didn't come to offer you anything Ed, except an apology. Here.

214
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,600
外公:爱尔兰威士忌?
Grandpa: Irish Whisky?

215
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:25,200
杰森:我想,我承认内心深处确实想通过给你钱而让你难堪.对不起.
Jason: Well, you know, I thought that maybe deep down I really did want to embarrass you a little by offering you that money I admit that, I'm sorry.

216
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,100
外公:坐下.拿两个玻璃杯.
Grandpa: Sit down. Grab a couple of glasses.

217
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:35,600
杰森:好的.来盘跳棋怎么样?
Jason: OK. Game a checkers?

218

外公:好的.
Grandpa: Sure.

219
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,300
杰森:在这些瓶子里加姜汁酒怎么弄?
Jason: How we gonna get any ginger ale in those glasses?

220
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:46,800
外公:姜汁酒?这是威士忌.
Grandpa: Ginger ale? That's Irish man.

221
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,200
杰森:可你不能直接就喝这酒.
Jason: You can't drink that straight.

222
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,100
外公:小看我!
Grandpa: Blasphemy!

223
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,500
杰森:哦,说大话.
Jason: Oh, big talk.

224
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,000
外公:哦,看着吧
Grandpa: Oh, just watch.
