was a mine in Asturias.

It's possible she's nuts,
but she's so damned funny.

Because they'll even like us.

And that's imperative.

184

It's imperative that we have
the public opinion on our side.

-[Moscow] What's wrong with them?
-[Rio] They're not scary.

In every single movie,
the robbers wear scary masks.

Zombies, skeletons, Angel of Death--

209
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,800
[Berlin] With a gun in hand,
a nut job is scarier than a skeleton.

-Enough.
-Who's this hick with the mustache?

211
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,760
Dalí, son. A Spanish painter.
A very good one.

You know what's really scary?

216
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,440
Children's dolls. Those are pretty scary.

217
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,880
-What dolls?
-Goofy, Pluto, Mickey Mouse, all of those.

218
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,520
[Rio] A mouse with big ears is scarier.

-That's what you think?
-Yes, asshole.

I'm right. Listen...

222
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,880
If some hick with a gun goes anywhere
wearing a Mickey Mouse mask,

223
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,840
people will think he's nuts,
that he's there for a bloodbath,

224
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,920
and you know why?

225
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Because weapons and kids...

226
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,560
are two things you never put together.
Right, Dad?

227
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,720
Well, if you see it that way,
it's more dangerous, right?

228
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,840
More devious.

229
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,000
A Jesus mask
would be even more terrifying.

230

He's even more innocent.

-[Moscow] What's the difference?

[Tokyo] It was obvious this gang
needed more women.

234
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,360
A woman can spend two days
choosing shoes for a wedding...

235
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,360
but not even a single minute
choosing masks for a robbery.

236
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,280
Everything we had planned
was starting now.

I thought of all the innocent people

to enter the Royal Mint
with a three-ton arsenal.

242

That was through the truck

ready for printing.

[Tokyo] Courage and heroism

00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,840
Have you ever had a proper job?
Have you taken your résumé anywhere?

489
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,600
Damn it.

490
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,400
A résumé?

491
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,200
What for?

492
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,720
To get you out of jail?

493
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,760
Do you think I'm proud of that?

494
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,720
Going in and out of prison
for twelve years.

495
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,720
You know why?

496
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,400
Why?

497
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,800
Because I'm not very smart, son.

498
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,000
Neither are you.

499
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,560
But, in this job,
someone else is putting in the brains.

500
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,800
If we're lucky, and you don't fool around,

501
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,800
you'll get out of here
with your life sorted out.

502
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,120
-What you mean by fool around?
-Come on, damn it.

503
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,800
Fill up those.

504
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,800
[phone ringing]

505
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,120
I want you to answer the phone

506
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,720
and convince them
we're shut down due to technical problems.

507
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,640
Got it?

508
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:31,880
Yes.

509
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,200
I have no choice
but to point a gun at you.

510
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,360
-Can you feel it?
-Yes.

511
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,240
All right.

512
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,480
Now.

513
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,240
-Royal Mint, can I help you?
-[woman] May I speak with Arturo, please.

514
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,480
I'm sorry, Mr. Arturo
can't be reached at the moment.

515
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,800
The system is down.

516
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,720
No, I can't ask him to come upstairs.

517
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,560
No, he's not able to answer the phone.

518
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,480
No, it's not possible.

519
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,800
No--

520
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,400
[woman] I don't understand why.

521
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,360
Because, I don't know--
I don't know where he is right now.

522
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,400
I don't know if he's in the mint,
the museum, or the cafeteria.

523
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,400
Besides, that's not my job, miss!

524
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,960
That performance deserves an Oscar...

525
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,960
Miss Gaztambide.

526
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,960
[clanking]

527
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,600
[Tokyo] Twenty minutes in,

528
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,000
we started wiring
our analog communications system

529
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,360
to talk to the Professor.

530
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,560
[singing indistinctly]

531
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,440
Cellphone free. No radio frequencies.

532
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,800
So no one could hear us.

533
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,680
We sealed all the doors,
and the alarms haven't gone off yet.

534
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,880
We're in a kind of limbo.

535
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,440
Without anyone knowing
that we've seized the Royal Mint.

536
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,400
And during that sweet calm
before the storm...

537
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,440
it simply seems...

538
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,320
like just another day.

539
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,480
You're actually handsome.

540
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,320
[knock on door]

541
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,440
-Who is it?
-[Rio] It's me. Let me in.

542
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,560
What are you doing, Rio?
If the Professor sees us, he'll kill us.

543
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,520
I know. Come here, I need to talk to you.

544
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,360
-Come here. Sit down.
-What's going on?

545
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,120
What's going on?

546
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,120
The heist is tomorrow.

547
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,280
We have no fucking idea what will happen.

548
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,520
I want you to know
that I'm serious about you.

549
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,120
And... I completely understand that--

550
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,800
That you're a woman of certain age...

551
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:42,000
and it's possible you're looking
for a more serious commitment.

552
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,720
That's why I want to give you this.

553
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,360
I didn't get you a ring
because we're stuck in here.

554
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,440
But when I'm out of here,
I'll get you the king of all diamonds.

555
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,000
You'll have to put your hand
in a fucking wheelbarrow.

556
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,520
What is this?

557
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,720
An engagement plaque?

558
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,760
Now, at least you'll know my real name.

559
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,880
Yeah, but knowing our real names
is not allowed.

560
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,880
Well, don't look at it.

561
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:15,960
But it's yours.

562
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,520
How can I tell you this?

563
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,880
What we have has been very good.

564
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,600
Okay? Awesome.

565
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,920
-We've been together a few nights...
-A few nights?

566
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,200
Damn, every night.
Except for, what, four or five?

567
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,880
Honestly...

568
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,360
I don't think we're meant for each other.

569
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,520
-Don't we have good sex?
-Yes, we have good sex.

570
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,360
Well, that's a good start, right?

571
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,560
But it takes more than good sex
to make a good couple.

572
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,240
Are you saying this because
I'm 12 years younger than you?

573
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,120
I'm getting 300 million euros.

574
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,360
I'm not a kid. My life's sorted out.

575
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,480
-Really, Rio, I wish it was love, but--
-Hey, don't say that.

576
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,000
There was love. I was there.

577
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,560
There's somebody else, right?

578
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,400
Not anymore.

579
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,200
Look, Rio...

580
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,400
When this is all over,

581
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,160
we'll go to Tahiti together,
and we'll see how that works.

582
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,400
But tomorrow
I only have one thing on my mind:

583
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,200
Not getting killed.

584
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,360
Rio.

585
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,160
Rio, no...

586
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,400
No, no.

587
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,560
One of the phones in buzzing.

588
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,640
Turn it off.

589
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,800
The vault is open.

590
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,720
Put on your vest, and be ready to leave.

591
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,440
When you're ready,
we'll activate the alarm.

592
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,400
Berlin, get ready to open the doors.

593
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,360
Hostages!

594
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,520
For your own safety,
move three steps back!

595
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,800
A little bit more this way. That's it.

596
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,400
There you go.
Everything will be all right.

597
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,960
A little bit closer.

598
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,200
Everything's going to be okay.

599
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,840
-[Monica whimpers]
-Shh.

600
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,760
Relax.

601
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,760
Calm down. I'm looking at the bags.

602
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,920
They're filled with money.
They'll be out of here in no time.

603
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,600

[man] Z-24, on our way.

607
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,200
-We'll be there in two minutes.
-Two minutes.

608
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,320
Two minutes.

609
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,560
Why did the alarm go off?

610
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,440
I don't know.

611
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,280
They're just standing there.
I don't understand.

612
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,840
-Why not just take the money and leave?
-I don't know.

613
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,920
One minute, 40 seconds.

614
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,440
One minute--

615
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,360
What's your name?

616
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,240
Arturo.

617
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,720
-Arturo, right?
-Yes.

618
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,240
I haven't seen anything!

619
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,440
-I haven't seen anything, I swear!
-Look at me.

620
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,840
-I haven't seen anything.
-Come on, Arturo. Look.

621
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,520
-No.
-Look at me.

622
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,800
Look at me. Hey, hey.

623
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,440
Come on.

624
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,480
Hey.

625
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,360
Do you like movies?

626
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,400
Do you?

627
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:02,920
Yes.

628
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,960
I'm very fond of movies.

629
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,800
Okay, and have you noticed
how in horror movies...

630
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,840
at the beginning
there's always this nice guy,

631
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,840
just like you, that makes you think...

632
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,920
"He's going to get killed."

633
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,560
Yes.

634
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,360
And then it happens.

635
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:24,920
He always gets killed.

636
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,160
Believe me, Arturo...

637
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,960
You're going to get yourself killed.

638
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,760
[man] Z-24 to Central,
we're 30 seconds away.

639
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,880
Thirty seconds.

640
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,400
Thirty seconds.

641
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:48,120
It is imperative that the police
have no idea what we're doing.

642
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:53,800
We'll make them believe
we are there to rob the place.

643
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,400
We were caught with the money,
and everything got screwed up.

644
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,000
We pull out the guns
and fire without warning,

645
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,800
as though we didn't have
any other choice...

646
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:01,680
than to back down.

647
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,440
And then...

648
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,960

649
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,400
We go back inside.

650
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:14,880
Let them think...

651
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,400
that we're cornered like rats.

652
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,920
Let them think we're winging it.

653
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,120
[Tokyo] Now!

654
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,800
Tokyo! Tokyo, wait! Damn it!

655
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:25,920
Tokyo!

656
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,600
[Tokyo] Go out, drop the money,

657
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,960
start firing without warning,
and get back inside.

658
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,240
I heard that more than 30 times.

659
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:41,640
What the Professor didn't tell us

660
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,200
is that they would also fire
without warning.

661

[man] Requesting immediate back up

00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,120
We've taken hostile fire.

679
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,800
Man down. I repeat, man down.

680
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:19,760
[Tokyo] The bullet of a M16 fires
at 2100 miles per hour.

681

Faster than the speed of sound.

So, if they shoot in you in the heart...

683
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,920
you won't even hear
the bullet that killed you.

That's how I knew
