Look brave.

谢谢你 上尉 安斯沃思太太
Thank you, Captain, Mrs Ainsworth.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,600
真的不让我去车站送你吗
Can't I come to the station?

5
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,400
我并没有那么英勇
I'm not that brave.

6
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,700
噢 我亲爱的莉齐
Oh, my darling Lizzie.

My egg was hard again, Mary

12

怪生蛋的母鸡去吧
Blame the chicken.

13
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,800
不行
No.

Oh, no.

大周末的非要这样弄吗
Must you, on a Sunday?

18
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,200
抱歉 伦奥纳德叔叔 但她出毛病了
Sorry, Uncle Leonard, but she's playing up.

19
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,700
你这样子不能去教堂啊
You can't go to church like that.

20
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,200
噢 反正我也没想去 修这个要很久呢
Oh, I'm not anyway. This could be a long job.

21
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,900
- 玛丽! - 她不会听得见的
- Mary! - She won't hear you.

22
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,500
煮个蛋都煮不好
Can't even boil an egg!

23
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,700
我们也只请得起她这样的了 你这个老可怜
She's all we can afford, you old misery.

24
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,100
你娶我的时候就清楚我不会做饭
You knew I couldn't cook when you married me.

25
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,800
而你也清楚我老了
And you knew I was old.

26
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,600
看下时间!
Look at the time!

27
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,200
噢
Oh.

28
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,300
- 早上好 马普尔小姐 - 早上好
- Morning, Miss Marple. - Good morning.

29
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,700
你是怎么做到的 格丽泽尔达
How did you manage that, Griselda?

30
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,000
他终于能早到一次了
He'll be early for once.

I shall tell you this evening, Jane.

33
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,900
记得带你的西洋李子金酒过来
And bring some your damson gin over

34
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,500
或许能弥补一下玛丽糟糕的厨艺
It might take the edge off Mary's cooking.

# 夏日再次到来 #

# 大地再次欢快雀跃 #
Once more the glad earth yields

# 夏日乔木深深的影子 #

00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:14,000
# 热辣的空气闪闪发光 #
And glow of summer air

39
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:21,000
# 那些飞舞的思绪和喜悦的心情 #
And winging thoughts and happy moods

40
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,400
# 关于爱与欢乐与祈祷 #
Of love and joy and prayer...

41
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,496
但各人被试探
But every man is tempted

42
00:05:32,497 --> 00:05:37,497
乃是被自己的私欲牵引诱惑的
when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.

43
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:42,959
私欲既怀了胎
Then when lust hath conceived,

44
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,009
就生出罪来
it bringeth forth sin,

45
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:49,397
罪既长成
and sin, when it is finished,

46
00:05:49,398 --> 00:05:52,786
就生出死来
bringeth forth death.

47

今天的选读到此结束
Here endeth the lesson.

48
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,100
别扭来扭去了 莱蒂斯!
Stop wriggling, Lettice!

49
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,400
- 是莱提丝 - 大家都叫你莱蒂斯
- It's Letteece - Everyone calls you Lettice.

50
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,000
你和大家不一样 劳伦斯
You're not everyone, Lawrence.

51
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,100
规矩点 别忘了你在哪里
Behave. Don't forget where you are.

52
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,900
别动
Steady.

53
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,700
你应该画成一本日历
You should be on a calendar.

54
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,400
然后挂在你父亲的书房里
We could hang it in your father's study.

55
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,000
噢 劳伦斯
Oh, Lawrence.

56
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,500
鬼鬼祟祟的 大饱眼福了?
Get an eyeful, creeping around?

57
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,700
她穿着泳衣呢
She's in her bathing suit.

58
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,500
列丁先生是个艺术家
Mr Redding's an artist.

59
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,300
对他来说 这就像是在看一碗樱桃
It's like looking at a bowl of cherries for him.

60
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,200
除非她把泳衣脱掉
Until she takes it off.

61
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,600
你的鼻子沾了汽油呢
You've got an oily nose.

62
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,300
上周日的英国国教
Last Sunday's collection

63
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,500
传道会的捐款中筹得了
in aid of the Church of England Missionary Society,

64
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,900
总共十八先令和十一便士 做得很好 各位
a total of 18 shillings and 11 pences. Well done, everybody.

65
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,300
- 这肯定搞错了 - 什么?
- That can't be right. - What?

66
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,700
传道会将大大受益于我们做出的努力
The society benefits enormously from the efforts we make.

67
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,700
我一个人就捐了一磅
I put in a pound to myself.

68
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,600
我这里有一封来自传道会的感谢信
I have here a letter of thanks from the secretary.

69
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,700
上校
Colonel...

70
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,900
怎么了 玛乔丽?
Yes, Marjorie?

71
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,800
- 这不对劲 - 什么?
- There's something wrong... - What?

72
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,800
嘘!
Shh!

73
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,300
- 什么? - 嘘
- What? - Shh.

74
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,400
你真的确定吗
You are quite sure?

75
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,800
在可怜的布鲁斯的忌日那天
I always put a pound note into the box

76
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,800
我总会投张一英镑的钞票进筹款箱
on the anniversary of poor Bruce's passing.

77
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,000
我知道 但也许这次
I know, but perhaps this time...

78
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,300
得了吧 马普尔小姐
Come on, Miss Marple!

79
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,600
如果玛乔丽说她放了一英镑
If Marjorie says she put a pound in

80
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,800
那她肯定放了 那这钱哪去了呢
then she did, so where's it gone?

81
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,700
我还以为你会紧抓住
I thought you'd be straining

82
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,000
这引领找出罪恶的绳子呢
at the leash to sniff out the culprit.

83
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,600
你在发现罪恶方面的确小有名气啊
You do have a reputation to maintain.

84
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,600
普罗瑟罗上校 您太过奖了
My reputation, Colonel Protheroe, if I have one

85
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,800
如果我真的有点名气的话 那也与此无关
how very kind of you to suggest I do - is neither here nor there.

86
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,500
我只是想现在谈及罪恶是否言之过早了
I merely wonder if it's too early to talk of culprits.

87
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,300
- 荒谬 - 卢修斯
- Nonsense! - Lucius.

88
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,400
安妮 别挠我
Anne, don't paw me.

89
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,200
好了 听着 我是教区委员 且我并不傻
Now, look. I'm a church warden, and I was in intelligence.

90
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,200
我看得出这里面有猫腻
I know when something smells fishy.

91
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,400
这可能还只是冰山一角 牧师!
It could be the tip of the iceberg. Vicar!

92
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,200
简 我们明天换个地方吧 试试三角帽酒馆
Jane, shall we try the Toby Jug tomorrow just for a change?

93
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,600
好主意
Good idea.

94
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,100
莱蒂斯今天早上去哪里了
Where's Lettice this morning?

95
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,700
- 列丁先生在为她画肖像 - 在周日画?
- Mr Redding's painting her. - On a Sunday?

96
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,800
- 嗯 - 你不觉得...
- Mm-hm. - You don't think...?

97
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,000
他的确很有一套 但她还是个小女孩
He does have a way with him, but she's just a girl.

98
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,700
如果真有情人的话 我想他会选年纪大点的
I'd plump for an older candidate if there is somebody.

99
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,800
别忘了明天下午四点半的八卦茶话会哦
Don't forget, ladies, tea and scandal tomorrow at 4:30.

100
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,700
还有 我已经邀请了莱斯特太太 我来啦
And I've invited Mrs Lester. I'm coming!

101
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,000
或许我们能了解她多一点
Perhaps we'll find out a little more about her.

102
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,900
首先要了解的是为什么她喜欢住在蓝野猪旅馆
Something would be a start. Fancy staying at the Blue Boar.

103
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,500
那里和她不怎么相称
Not very homely for her.

104
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,300
收集很多东西 你懂我的意思吧
Very well-stocked, if you take my meaning.

105
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,400
- 噢? - 在义卖中积极出手
- Oh? - Tipsy at the jumble sale.

106
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,600
为什么我们亲爱的牧师非要选这么肤浅的妻子
Why the dear vicar had to choose such a shallow wife

107
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,000
而且以他这样的年纪
and at his age too...

108
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,100
我要求查看教区的全套账目
I expect to see a full set of parish accounts

109
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,900
否则我将进一步闹大此事
or I'm going to take this matter further.

110
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,600
- 好吧? - 你听明白我的意思了么?
- Yes? - Is that quite clear?

111
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,200
- 是的 - 那就周二六点十五分在你家见
- Yes. - Tuesday. Vicarage, 6:15 sharp.

112
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,500
我完全明白你的意思
I know just what you mean.

113
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,000
上校 您的房子建筑研究进展如何
Colonel, any news of your architectural sleuths?

114
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,200
噢 海多克医生
Yes, Dr Haydock.

115
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,600
他们昨晚抵达了
They arrived last night.

116
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,900
他们要拍照绘图 还有些乱七八糟的事
They'll be taking photographs and making drawings and "who-knows-what" .

117
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,300
但这就是拥有
Still One of the perils

118
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,600
像老屋这种重要建筑所要面对的
of owning an important house like Old Hall.

119
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,800
日安 医生
Good day, Doctor.

120
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,400
真是个讨厌的人
What a dreadful, dreadful man.

121
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,500
- 我走路吧 爸爸 - 不 上车
- I'll walk, Daddy. - No. Get in.

122
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,400
肖像画得怎么样了
How's the portrait coming along?

123
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,900
非常好 谢谢关心 安妮
Perfectly well, thank you, Anne.

124
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,400
莱蒂斯我还以为他画的是你穿着
Lettice...I thought he was painting you

125
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,500
- 漂亮蓝裙子的样子呢 - 是啊
- in that pretty blue dress of yours. - Yes...

126
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,800
但今天他只画我的手
but today he was just doing my hands

127
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,000
所以我就懒得穿了
so I didn't bother to wear it.

128
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,300
你那里放什么东西呢
What have you got in there?

129
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,600
没放什么
Nothing.

130
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,500
让我看看
Let me see.

131
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,800
给我
Come.

132
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,800
这 这更有艺术感
I-It's more artistic.

133
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,300
是艺术感还是情色
There's art and there's smut!

134
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,300
他居然敢?你居然敢!
How dare he? And how dare you?

135
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,600
嘘 嘘
Ssh, ssh.

136
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,400
看上帝的份上 别大声叫嚷
Don't shout, for godness' sake.

137
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,400
我自己的事自己处理 谢谢了 安妮
I'll fight my own battles. Thank you, Anne.

138
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,100
我只是在为我们的客人着想
I was thinking of our guests.

139
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,500
早上好 教授
Good morning, Professor.

140
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,800
需要的东西都齐全了吗
Do you have everything you need?

141
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,800
谢谢你 是的 你可爱的女儿帮了很多忙
Thank you, yes. Your so charming daughter was most helpful.

142
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,900
继女儿
Stepdaughter.

143
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,700
啊 睡美人醒来了

144
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,600
对不起 爷爷 早上好
Je m'excuse, grand-pare. Good morning.

145
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,000
早上好 小姐 午餐是在十二点半
Morning, mademoiselle. Lunch will be served at half past twelve.

146
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,500
我丈夫很希望能听到你们的研究成果
My husband's very keen to hear about your research.

147
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,100
我们很荣幸 对吧 爷爷
We are flattered, aren't we, Grandfather?

148
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,700
不及我丈夫那么荣幸
Not as much as he is.

149
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,000
居然允许在你的花园里出现这样的行为 牧师
Permitting that sort of behaviour in your own garden, Vicar?

150
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,900
不 不 我是说这 这完全不能被接受
No, no. I mean it's... it's utterly unacceptable.

151
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,800
好了 请把列丁先生的电话号码给我
Now, Mr Redding's telephone number, please.

152
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,400
这里真美啊
Isn't it gorgeous?

153
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,600
没有什么能像英国的夏日傍晚那样迷人
Nothing quite so beautiful as an English summer's evening.

154
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,300
送给我们的女主人的吗 真悦目
For our hostess? How lovely!

155
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,900
我听说你手里的酒更让人愉悦
Not as lovely as that stuff, I hear.

156
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,500
走吧?
Shall we?

157
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,400
噢 谢谢你
Oh, thank you.

158
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,900
感谢主赐给我们这食物 祝福我们能热爱
Bless this food to our use and us to thy loving

159
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,500
忠诚地服事您
and faithful service

160
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,000
这是由您的大地养分以及人类劳动
nourished by the fruit of your earth

161
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,800
所带来的收获
and by the work of human hands.

162
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,200
让我们以真诚的顺从回报您 主
May we render you true obedience, Lord

163
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,500
并服从您的意愿
and bend ourselves to thy will.

164
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,900
并让我们永远谨记为自己服务
And make us ever needful of the minds of others.

165
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,000
呃 为他人服务 阿门
Er, ever mindful of the needs of others. Amen.

166
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
阿门
Amen.

167
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,200
好吧 我只能道歉
Well, I can only apologise.

168
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,100
噢 反正上校总是找借口批评这批评那的
The colonel's always looking for an excuse to criticise.

169
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,200
我想你画中的格丽泽尔达不是穿着泳衣吧
I hope you're not painting Griselda in a bathing suit?

170
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,500
马普尔小姐 那太恶心了
Miss Marple, that's disgusting.

171
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,300
- 谢谢你 - 当然不是
- Thank you. - Certainly not.

172
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,100
但你一定要来看看 克莱蒙特先生
But you must come to see it, Mr Clement.

173
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,900
画正好到了一个很有趣的阶段
It's at that very interesting stage.

174
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,800
- 像丹尼斯那样吗 - 噢 真好笑
- Like Dennis? - Oh, ha-ha.

175
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,100
- 明天下午茶时间来一下吧 - 好的
- Pop over tomorrow, around teatime. - I will.

176
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,600
- 这是什么 玛丽 - 汤
- What is this, Mary? - Soup.

177
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,300
它有名字吗
Does it have a name?

178
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,300
"稀里糊涂乱切一气
"bis and bobs and odds and sods

179
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,500
再加上点肉丁"汤
and the meat raion's been cut again" soup.

180
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,600
抱歉 抱歉
Sorry. Sorry.

181
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,800
你今晚精神很紧张不安啊 豪伊斯先生
You're a bag of nerves this evening, Mr Hawes.

182
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,900
不仅是今晚 请给我一杯水好吗
Not just tonight. May I have a glass of water?

183
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,300
- 还有人要水吗 - 不了 谢谢你
- Anyone else? - No, thank you.

184
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,500
要知道 这都是我的药在起作用
If it wasn't for my medicine, you see...

185
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,400
别担心 神经质又不会传染
Don't worry, you can't catch nerves.

186
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,300
这是慈悲的主赐给我的不幸的折磨修行
It's a wretched affliction I bear with God's grace.

187
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,100
说到不幸的折磨
Talking of wretched afflictions

188
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,400
罗尼 普罗瑟罗上校要周二见我
Ronnie, Colonel Protheroe on Tuesday.

189
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,300
你能整理一下教区账目吗
Can you get the parish accounts into some sort of order?

190
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,200
- 我尽力 - 有时我真想勒死普罗瑟罗
- I'll try. - I could strangle Protheroe sometimes.

191
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,800
- 愿主宽恕我 - 我会扎死他
- May God forgive me. - I'd stab him.

192
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,900
- 我会毒死他 - 我会一枪打死他
- I'd poison him. - I'd shoot him.

193
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,300
- 用我的枪 - 他对莱蒂斯真是太坏了
- Use my gun. - He's so rotten to Lettice.

194
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,500
- 噢 - 就因为他买下了老屋
- Aw. - Just because he bought Old Hall,

195
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,300
他就以为自己是个乡绅地主什么的
he thinks he's the local squire something.

196
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,100
你不能那样对别人啊
You can't treat people like that now.

197
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,100
你说得没错 那你会怎么做呢 马普尔小姐
You're quite right. And how would you do it, Miss Marple?

198
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,300
我从不随便谈论谋杀 列丁先生
I never speak lightly of murder, Mr Redding.

199
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,100
我讨厌冒不必要的险
I hate to tempt fate.

200
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,600
当然在这美丽地方是不会发生的啊
Surely not in this lovely place?

201
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,400
我们都只是圣玛丽・米德村的平凡人
We're all very ordinary in St Mary Mead,

202
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,000
但平凡人有时候会做出最惊人的事
but ordinary people sometimes do the most astonishing things

203
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,600
- 你是真的有手枪吗 - 是啊 是德国枪
- Do you really have a pistol? - Somewhere. It's German.

204
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,700
- 我偷出来的 - 你还真是勇敢啊
- I liberated it. - Were you wonderfully brave?

205
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,200
虽受过良好训练 但还是很怕死
Very well-trained, but scared to death.

206
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,700
五分钟后 我就清桌上菜
I'll clear in five minutes.

207
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,500
炖萝卜和鱼 主要是萝卜
Fish and turnip stew-mostly turnip.

208
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,300
噢 麻烦拿一下杏子酸辣酱
Oh, bring the apricot chutney, will you?

209
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,600
圣玛丽・米德村牧师寓所
St Mary Mead vicarage.

210
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,600
不 弗兰克 我不可以
No, Frankie, I can't.

211
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,200
但你母亲会在那里的
But you'lI have your mum there.

212
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,800
法官是谁
Who's the magistrate?

213
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,800
那就起码要两磅罚款了
That'll be two-quid fine at least

214
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,400
我们怎么能存到这么多的...
How are we ever going to save up to get a...

215
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,700
我很抱歉 但你打错号码了
I am very sorry but you have mistook a wrong number.

216
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,900
我禁止你再去见他
I forbid you to see him again!

217
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,300
他只是在为我画肖像
He was only painting me.

218
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,400
我倒是希望他做了什么蠢事
I wish he were doing something else stupid

219
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,400
看你大惊小怪的
the fuss you're making.

220
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,900
- 别没大没小! - 那你也别讨人厌啊
- Don't be common! - Well, don't be horrid, then.

221
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,400
就因为你的坏脾气 杜福斯爷孙都借辞回床了
You've driven the Dufosses to bed because your foul mood.

222
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,600
- 好啊 你也可以滚回去啊 - 非常乐意
- Well, you blood can go too! - Gladly.

223
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,309
坐下 我们还没吃完呢
Sit down. We haven't finished.

224
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,300
晚安 卢修斯
Good night, Lucius.

225
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,400
有一些人会觉得
There are those

226
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,500
偷猎是一种英雄传奇式的行为 塔兰特
who take a romantic view of poaching, Tarrant.

227
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,800
但我不这么觉得
I do not.

228
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,483
这次 你要坐牢了
This time, you'll go to prison.

229
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:31,000
先生 你不能这样 先生
Sir, you can't, sir!

230
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,300
- 没事的 妈妈 - 夫人 坐下
- All right, Mum. - Madam, sit down.

231
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,900
监禁二十八天
28 days.

232
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:42,400
我会丢掉工作的 你这老混蛋
I'll lose my job, you old bastard.

233
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,700
二十九天
29.

234
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,400
圣玛丽・米德村牧师寓所
St Mary Mead vicarage.

235
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,800
这并不公正!
It's not fair!

236
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,300
- 玛丽? - 我要出去
- Mary? - I'm going out!

237
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,400
问题不仅是年龄上的差距 简
It's not just the difference in our ages, Jane.

238
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,100
牧师和他的妻子也能很开心啊
The vicar and his wife are perfectly happy.

239
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,000
我想他们有了孩子会更开心
They'd be happier with a child, I think.

240
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,800
那也是他们共同的孩子
It would be their own.

241
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,200
莱蒂斯母亲去世时 她才两岁
Lettice was two when her mother died.

242
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,100
到我嫁给卢修斯的时候 她已经长大了
By the time I married Lucius, she was too old to think of me

243
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,000
只会觉得我是个可恶的继母
as anything other than the wicked stepmother.

244
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,000
我总惹她烦 而且
I get on her nerves, and...

245
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,600
恐怕 她也老惹得我烦
..I'm afraid she gets on mine.

246
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,300
这一切让他生气 甚至比平时更生气
That makes him angry - even angrier than normal.

247
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,100
你们有没有想过要个共同的孩子
Might you have a child of your own one day?

248
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,500
没有
No.

249
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,600
那 那方面的事情已经
That...side of things has...

250
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,900
很少进行了
dwindled rather.

251
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,400
其实是完全没有了
Completely.

252
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,100
我需要温柔的对待 简
I need tenderness, Jane.

253
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,800
而那与他本性相违
And that's just not in his nature.

254
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,200
谢谢你
Thank you.

255
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,500
对不起
Sorry.

256
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,900
噢 我们不时都会有些话不吐不快
Oh, we all have to get things off our chest occasionally.

257
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,000
但是 我嫁给他是为了安定下来
Still... I married him for a kind of certainty.

258
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,800
战争之后 我们都想要安定下来 不是吗
We all wanted certainty after the war, didn't we?

259
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,300
我应该满足于我所得到的
I must settle for what I've got.

260
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,700
- 凑凑活活过下去? - 凑活吧
- Make do and mend? - Make do.

261
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,500
而且至少 我曾被温柔地对待过
And at least there once was someone tender,

262
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,700
但他没有从战场上回来
but he didn't come back from the fighting.

263
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,700
简 我就知道你会来
Jane, I knew you'd come.

264
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,200
- 我必须来 - 噢 亲爱的
- I had to. - Oh, my darling.

265
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,100
我们的车来了
There's our lift

266
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,200
我们最好别让他等久了
We'd better not keep him waiting.

267
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,400
该死的蠢蛋!
Bloody fool!

268
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,200
扶我一把!
Help me!

269
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,500
你受伤了吗
Are you hurt?

270
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,700
没有 噢!
No. Oh!

271
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,700
- 伤了 - 伤到脚踝了
- Yes. - Caught her ankle.

272
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,700
噢...
Oh...

273
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,700
我实在是太抱歉了
I'm so terribly sorry.

274
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,300
这不是你的错
It wasn't your fault.

275
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,700
一定要这样来固定关节
It has to support the sprain.

276
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,100
我车里还有一根拐杖
I have a stick in the car.

277
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,800
明天你就可以拄着拐杖走动了
You might be able to hobble by tomorrow.

278
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,600
我可不想拄着拐杖 海多克医生
I don't want to be a hobbler, Dr Haydock.

279
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,800
要我煮些茶么?
Shall I make some tea?

280
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,200
显然不必了
Apparently, that won't be necessary.

281
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,000
看来八卦茶话会正朝着我们过来了
It seems tea and scandal are coming to us.

282
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,700
我迷路了 有着弗兰芒挂毯和天花板很高
I am lost. The small drawing room with the Flemish tapestry

283
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,000
的小画室在哪里
and the magnificent ceiling?

284
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,700
另一边再过去两间 这是我父亲的书房
Two down on the other side. That's my father's study.

285
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,521
听到我来了吧
Heard me, then?

286
00:22:55,522 --> 00:22:56,800
怎么可能听不到啊 丹尼斯
How could I not, Dennis?

287
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,200
- 要不要去兜风? - 坐那玩意去?
- Want to go for a ride? - On that thing?

288
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,300
去年我们不就
Last year, we...

289
00:23:00,301 --> 00:23:02,500
去年我只有十六岁 所以才觉得好玩
Last year I was 16 and it was fun.

290
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,700
好吧 我也没见劳伦斯・列丁开着跑车啊
Well, I haven't seen Lawrence Redding in a sports car.

291
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,900
如果他有钱就会开了
He would if he had the money

292
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,000
而且他看起来超级...成熟
and he'd look so wonderfully...mature.

293
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,900
明天一起打网球?
See you tomorrow for tennis?

294
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,100
噢 没错 和丹尼斯打网球
Oh, yes, tennis with Dennis.

295
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,100
他怎样了
How did he get on?

296
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,700
一个月监禁 普罗瑟罗判的
A month inside. Protheroe.

297
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,100
列丁先生 你该把这个锁起来
Mr Redding, you should shut this away.

298
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,000
或许吧
Probably.

299
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,900
这是给你的 下次在蓝野猪旅馆再见了
Here's one for you next time you're in the Blue Boar.

300
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,100
你确定不需要我走的时候把门锁好?
You sure you don't want me to start locking up when I go?

301
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,900
这可是英国人的特色啊 塔太太
This is the heart of England, Mrs T.

302
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,200
再说 锁住房门就是把爱拒绝在外
Besides, lock up the house and you lock out love.

303
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,100
噢 我的天 穿着泳衣吗
Oh, my Lord! In her bathing suit?

304
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,800
在我看来 上校肯定会很不高兴
The colonel won't have liked that from what I've seen.

305
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,000
他脾气火爆得像屁股着了火一样
Looks like he's got a poker up his bum.

306
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,500
火还不小呢
At least one.

307
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,400
你准备呆在圣玛丽・米德村吗 莱斯特太太
Will you be staying long in St Mary Mead, Mrs Lester?

308
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,100
叫我西尔维娅就好了
Sylvia, please.

309
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,940
我想再住会看看
I shall have to see.

310
00:24:14,941 --> 00:24:16,800
对你来说 我们不会太静了吗
We're not too quiet for you?

311
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,300
的确风平浪静 但改变和宁静也是好事
Like a millpond. But a change is as good as a rest.

312
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,000
具体是什么样的转变呢
A change...from what...exactly?

313
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,900
从我匆忙的生活中转变过来啊 哈特内尔小姐
My helter-skelter life, Miss Hartnell.

314
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
请恕我失陪了 我要去
If you'll excuse me, I must...

315
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,400
我要去看看格丽泽尔达的肖像画画得怎么样了
I must see how Griselda's portrait is coming along.

316
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,700
我真心希望你会喜欢 亲爱的
I do hope you like it, darling.

317
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,200
- 再见 - 再见
- Goodbye. - Bye.

318
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,700
- 下午好 牧师 - 再见
- Good afternoon, Vicar. - Goodbye.

319
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,200
那列丁画你的时候 你穿的是什么
And what are you wearing for Mr. Redding?

320
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,800
只是我的尊严 普赖斯・里德利太太
Just my dignity, Mrs. Price-Ridley,

321
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,700
还有一条粉红长围巾
and a pink feather boa.

322
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,600
是吗 格丽泽尔达
Really, Griselda!

323
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,300
我想我该去加点茶了
I think I'll just refresh the pot.

324
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,100
好了 谁想在大吉岭茶里面加点料
Now, who'd like a stiffener in their Darjeeling?

325
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,000
噢 我
Oh, I...

326
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,900
- 牧师 - 不
- Vicar... - No...

327
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,200
我忘了你要过来
I'd forgotten you were coming.

328
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,300
他该不是也在画普罗瑟罗太太的泳衣画吧
Is he doing Mrs. Protheroe too?

329
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,900
他的画笔可真是忙啊
Quite a busy boy with his brush.

330
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,700
她想要一起去伦敦 但是
She offered to come to London, but...

331
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,100
哎 我来这里就是为了逃避那里的
Well, I came here to get away from it and...

332
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,500
嗯 安妮不会适应的
Well, Anne wouldn't be suited to the...

333
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,700
我在那里的疯狂生活
the madness of my life there.

334
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,500
而我也不想她去适应 我对此疲倦了
And I wouldn't want her to be. I'm tired of it.

335
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,100
我厌倦了疯狂的生活
I'm tired of being wild.

336
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,200
对我们来说 你们现在就够疯狂了
You're quite wild enough for us.

337
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,900
我只觉得让你们失望了
I just feel that I've let you all down.

338
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,200
我在圣玛丽・米德村的日子
I've been happier in St Mary Mead

339
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,600
是我最开心的生活时光
than I've ever been in my life.

340
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,600
我觉得连我的作品都变好了
Even my work's better, I think.

341
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,814
无疑是少了些轻狂
That's certainly less wild.

342
00:26:29,815 --> 00:26:31,100
但你必须做个了断
But you must end it.

343
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:34,700
- 我做不到 - 那你应该考虑离开这里
- I can't. - Then you should consider leaving.

344
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,100
为她的声誉着想吧
Think of her reputation.

345
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,900
你是唯一知道的人
You are the only one who knows.

346
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,900
暂时而已 在这里只要打个喷嚏大家就能
Yet. You only have to sneeze in this village for someone to...

347
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,200
伯恩小姐带下周的花来了
Miss Bourne's here about next week's flowers.

348
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,400
噢 她迟到了 这可不像她
Oh, she's late. That's not like her.

349
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,900
请一定要仔细考虑我刚才说的话
Please, please think about what I've said.

350
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,500
晚上好 这里是老屋
Old Hall. Good evening.

351
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,600
是的 他在 请问你的名字是?
Yes, he is. Who shall I say?

352
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,700
我需要禀告您的名字 夫人
I'll have to give a name, madam.

353
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,600
仅限住客进入
RESIDENTS ONLY

354
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,400
你想怎么样 西尔维娅?
What do you want, Sylvia?

355
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,100
告诉你些事情
To tell you something,

356
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,000
再看看你那冷峻的嘴唇
and see that stiff upper lip wobble

357
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,800
像面对着行刑队那样地颤抖
as if you were facing a firing squad.

358
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,700
吸着人生最后一根烟
Last cigarette?

359
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,300
双眼被眼罩遮住
Blindfold?

360
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,100
行刑
Bang.

361
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:29,300
- 我明天就能上下楼梯了 - 要晨衣吗
- I'll manage the stairs by tomorrow. - Dressing gown?

362
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,800
要的 谢谢
Yes, please.

363
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,600
那幅肖像画怎么样
How was the portrait?

364
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,800
只匆匆看了一眼吧
A brief viewing?

365
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,800
- 你看到了 - 恐怕我们都看到了
- You saw. - I'm afraid we all did.

366
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,200
我告诉格丽泽尔达时 她都吓到了
Griselda was horrified when I told her.

367
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,400
如果普罗瑟罗发现的话
If Protheroe finds out...

368
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,900
我知道他是个混蛋 但毕竟安妮嫁给了他
Now, I know he's a brute, but Anne married him,

369
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,500
而我信仰婚姻的神圣
and I believe in the sanctity of marriage.

370
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,000
我多么幸运
I'm so lucky.

371
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,100
她本可以选择任何男人
She could have had anyone.

372
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,000
但她选择了你
She chose you.

373
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,900
这是我人生中最美好的三年时光
It's been the best three years of my life.

374
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,200
都收拾好了
Here we are.

375
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,100
梳子 镜子和书
Hairbrush, mirror and book.

376
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,800
这本书精彩吗
Is it a good read?

377
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,700
当然比生活精彩了 牧师
Betcha life it is, padre.

378
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,900
还需要从梳妆台上拿什么东西吗
Anything else from the dressing table?

379
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,600
不用了
No.

380
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,100
真美啊
Beautiful.

381
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,200
这一建筑时代的完美典范
A perfect example for this period.

382
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,700
的确 你们打算什么时候出版
Indeed. When are you going to publish?

383
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,000
我们杂志在秋天出刊
Autumn is the next edition of our journal.

384
00:29:45,401 --> 00:29:47,200
这期介绍的全部都是英国乡下的建筑
It will be all English country houses.

385
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,900
我会从巴黎给你寄一本的 我会把这记下来
I will send you a copy from Paris. I'll make a note of it.

386
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,400
法国现况如何
How is France now?

387
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,400
法国啊 嗯 怎么说呢
France? And, well, what do you say?

388
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,500
我们在逐渐恢复繁荣
We are getting on our feet.

389
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,900
你们的战争怎么样
How was your war?

390
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,400
情况不妙啊
Bad things happened.

391
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,500
那你呢 上校
And yours, Colonel?

392
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,300
很遗憾 我...
Unfortunately, I, er...

393
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,300
我不被允许去讨论我的服役工作
I am not at liberty to discuss my service.

394
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,900
- 卢修斯 - 嗯 啊 你们日安
- Lucius - Hmm? Ah. Good day to you.

395
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,800
我五点半会回来
I'll be back on the 5:30.

396
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,700
审判之后我要与罗斯・哈金斯太太会面
I have a meeting with Mrs. Ross-Harkins after court.

397
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,600
别忘了六点十五分要到牧师寓所去
Don't forget the vicarage at a quarter past six.

398
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,400
梅尔切斯特没东西卖吗
Aren't there any sales in Melchester?

399
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,000
伦敦是伦敦
London is London.

400
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,600
好吧 别买太多东西了
Well, don't buy too much.

401
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,800
不会买很多的
There won't be too much!

402
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,900
- 丹尼斯要载我去 - 什么
- Dennis is taking me. - What?

403
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,400
- 只载到车站啦 - 哦
- Only to the station. - Oh.

404
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,600
- 再见 - 再见
- Bye. - Bye.

405
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,376
噢 你看看这刮痕
Oh, look at this scratch!

406
00:30:59,377 --> 00:31:00,900
啊 那我的轮子呢
Well, what about my wheel?

407
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,800
是你自己没有留神 傻子!
You weren't looking, you fool!

408
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,900
我敢说 你肯定是想别的事 比如说那些账目
Mind on other things, I dare say, like those accounts.

409
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,390
你这是什么意思
What do you mean?

410
00:31:07,391 --> 00:31:08,700
哼 以后你就知道了
Well, we'll see what I mean.

411
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,700
务必要在六点十五分之前把账目交给牧师
Just make sure the vicar has them for six fifteen.

412
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,600
要知道 这车是有刹车的
It does have brakes, you know, this car

413
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,900
天啊 女人!
Good God, woman!

414
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,600
谢谢你
Thank you.

415
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,500
- 啊 克莱蒙特太太 - 上校
- Ah, Mrs. Clement. - Colonel.

416
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,400
去梅尔切斯特吗
Melchester?

417
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,100
去伦敦
London.

418
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,100
我相信你们的花园小屋
I trust your garden shed

419
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,900
很快就会恢复到正当的用途上的
will shortly be restored to its proper purpose.

420
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,500
它从来就没有过不正当的用途
It has never had an improper purpose.

421
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,200
显然 我们的标准不一致
Clearly our standards are different.

422
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,200
的确很显然 我很高兴这么说
Clearly, I'm glad to say.

423
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,900
你说什么
I beg your pardon?

424
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,000
为什么你这么糟糕地对待伦
Why are you so dreadful to Len?

425
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,400
他是个正直的好人
He's a good, honest man

426
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,900
他努力想要在基督教慈善中以身作则
who tries to set an example of Christian charity.

427
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,900
或许这慈善做得太过到家了
Perhaps charity can begin too close to home.

428
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,800
去梅尔切斯特的票 谢谢
Return to Melchester, please.

429
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,200
列丁先生追在牧师后面
Mr. Redding ran after the vicar

430
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,200
普罗瑟罗太太的鞋都脱掉了
and Mrs. Protheroe had her shoes off

431
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,600
而且我敢说她连衬裙都露出来了
and I'm sure you could see her petticoat.

432
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,800
今早我去付账单的时候
When I went to pay my paper bill this morning,

433
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,700
弗洛莉・兰迪说她完全不惊讶
Florrie Ranby said she wasn't at all surprised,

434
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,400
当然了 马普尔小姐早猜到是年纪大点的情人
and, of course, Miss Marple knew it was someone older.

435
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,200
周日那天 上校的圣经选读真是贴切
The colonel read a most apt lesson on Sunday

436
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,800
如果他知道的话
had he but known it:

437
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,100
"私欲既怀了胎
"When lust hath conceived,

438
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,300
就生出罪来"
it bringeth forth sin."

439
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,700
我要去修理下这个了
I have to put this right.

440
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,100
我父母想要我去肯尼亚
My parents want me to go to Kenya

441
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,500
帮他们管理农场
help them manage the farm.

442
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,100
你明年可以试着申请大学
You could try for university next year.

443
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,800
如果有其他值得留下的理由 我会的
I would if I had something else to stay for.

444
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,900
丹尼斯 别的不说
Dennis... Apart from anything...

445
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,500
你也知道我爸爸那人
well, you know Daddy,

446
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,700
- 金钱或地位 - 而我两者皆无
- money or prospects. - Nought out of two.

447
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,100
- 你说 如果没有他的话 - 不
- You mean, if it wasn't for him...? - No.

448
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,700
谁知道呢?
Well, who knows?

449
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,000
我们不能单纯做朋友吗
Can't we just be friends?

450
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,800
你可以忘了劳伦斯
You can forget about Lawrence.

451
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,900
伦叔叔进屋撞见他和你继母在一起
Uncle Len walked in on him and your stepmother

452
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,200
而他并不是在画她
and he wasn't painting her.

453
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,400
- 让我来倒吧 - 谢谢你
- Shall I be mother? - Thank you.

454
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,200
要知道 我是真的爱她 而不仅是因为
I do love her, you know. It's not just about...

455
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,100
性?
Sex?

456
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,400
我一直在想牧师所说的人们终究会知道
I keep thinking about what the vicar said about people knowing,

457
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,200
而我也发现报刊商威尔太太
and I got a very strange look

458
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,000
看我的眼神怪怪的
in the newsagent's from Mrs. Whale.

459
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,300
嗯 她消息确实灵通
Well, she's got wind of things.

460
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,700
戈德沃斯先生就是因为听威尔太太提起
The only reason Mr. Goldworthy knew about his wife and the Gl

461
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,200
尼龙长袜和口香糖才知道
was when he heard Mrs. Whale mention the nylon stockings

462
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,400
他妻子和美国兵的出轨
and the chewing gum.

463
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,900
为了安妮 我必须得离开了
I'll have to leave, for Anne's sake.

464
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,300
那倒是很勇敢
That's very brave.

465
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,500
嗯 是的 我很快就会走出来的
Yes, well, I'll soon be over it.

466
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,500
你不会的
You won't.

467
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,000
很长一段时间里都不会
Not for a long while.

468
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,400
什么都瞒不过你 对吧 马普尔小姐
Nothing gets past you, Miss. Marple, does it?

469
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,900
几乎没有过 年轻人
Hardly ever, young man.

470
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,700
我现在就去跟牧师说
I'll tell the vicar now.

471
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,000
- 他没那么快回来吧 - 说的也是
- He won't be back from his calls yet. - Nor will he.

472
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,700
有一件事我是可以帮忙的 马普尔小姐
There is something I could do for you, Miss. Marple.

473
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,600
如果你愿意的话
If you'd like.

474
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,800
列丁先生在书房等你
Mr. Redding in the study.

475
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,600
这是正确的决定
It's the right decision.

476
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,400
你跟她说了吗
Have you told her?

477
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,700
- 我还没想到怎么说 - 会想到的
- I need to find the words. - You will.

478
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,200
你真信任我
Well, you're very trusting.

479
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,600
我自己都没有信心呢
I'm not that sure of myself.

480
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,700
我会把小屋打扫干净的
I'll clear out the shed.

481
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,600
谢谢你让我在那里暂住
Thank you for letting me set up in there.

482
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,262
这都是格丽泽尔达的主意
That was Griselda.

483
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,900
我还没完成她的肖像画呢
I never did finish her painting.

484
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,700
你是个很幸运的人
You're a very lucky man.

485
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,500
替我照顾她 好吗
Look after her for me, won't you?

486
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,500
我是说安妮
Anne, I mean.

487
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,900
现在 现在该怎么办

488
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,300
耐心点 让我想想

489
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,500
啊 玛丽 呃 低地农场的老艾博特先生
Ah, Mary. Erm, old Mr. Abbott over at Lower Farm,

490
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,500
他邻居来电说他又病重垂危了
his neighbour's telephoned to say he's poorly again,

491
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,200
所以我六点十五分之前都回不来了
so I won't be back by 6:15.

492
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:18,000
向普罗瑟罗上校道歉并请他等一下我
Apologise to Colonel Protheroe and ask him to wait for me.

493
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,600
我会尽量对他态度好点的
I'll be as nice as I can.

494
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,900
我现在还能记得
I can still see it now,

495
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,300
他来村里的第一天
his first day in the village.

496
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,000
在那一瞬间
It was one of those moments

497
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,400
我就知道一切都将会改变
when you know that nothing will ever be the same again.

498
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,300
他唤醒了我过去的回忆
He reminded me of what might have been...

499
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,400
那段对生活还有快乐希望的过去
...in the days when I still hoped for happiness.

500
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,900
要知道 去接受你改变不了的事情
There can be happiness in acceptance,

501
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,900
也会让你快乐起来
you know, of what can't change.

502
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,400
会吗
Can there?

503
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,700
谢谢你 简
Thank you, Jane.

504
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,400
谢什么呢
What for?

505
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,000
谢谢你没有批判我
For not judging me.

506
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,000
- 他晚点才会回来 - 噢 没关系
- He'll be late. - Oh, it's all right.

507
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,100
- 我可以等 - 不等也不行 对吧
- I'll wait. - You'll have to, won't you?

508
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,100
噢 谢谢你
Oh, thank you.

509
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,900
有一只可爱的小羽冠巧妇鸟
There's a sweet little crested

510
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,900
喜欢在这边小树林活动
wren that likes this side of the woods.

511
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,600
劳伦斯有提过以后的计划吗
Did Lawrence mention the future at all?

512
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,600
我去听吧
I'll go, I'll go.

513
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,300
圣玛丽・米德235号
St. Mary Mead 235.

514
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,000
那是找我的
It was for me.

515
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,700
- 找你的? - 说 是让我去牧师寓所
- For you? - I'm...wanted at the vicarage.

516
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,000
失陪了
Sorry.

517
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,500
晚上好 教授先生
Bonsoir, Monsieur le Professeur.

518
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,000
晚上好 夫人
Ah, bonsoir, madame.

519
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,800
真是适合散步的傍晚 对吧
A beautiful evening for walking, no?

520
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,500
要是我能走动的话就好了
If only I could.

521
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,600
噢
Oh.

522
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,500
再见 列丁先生
Goodbye, Mr. Redding.

523
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,200
晚上好 夫人
Bonsoir, madame.

524
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,700
你去哪里了

525
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:55,000
噢 随便走走而已

526
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,133
如果你们现在回去的话 我可以一起吗
If you're going back now, may I join you?

527
00:40:57,134 --> 00:40:58,700
- 好啊 - 谢谢你
- Yes. - Thank you.

528
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,400
要大杯的 我今天过得糟透了
A large one. I've had a hell of a day.

529
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,300
晚上好 玛丽
Good evening, Mary.

530
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,700
- 跟上校一起在书房等吧 - 他也在吗
- Wait in the study with the colonel. - He's here?

531
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,000
是的
He is.

532
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,800
耶和华 求你将你的道指示我
Show me your ways, O Lord,

533
00:41:34,801 --> 00:41:35,700
将你的路教训我
teach me your paths.

534
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,200
求你以你的真理引导我 教训我
Guide me in your truth and teach me.

535
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,800
耶和华 求你将你的道指示我
Show me your ways, O Lord,

536
00:41:38,801 --> 00:41:39,600
将你的路教训我
teach me your paths.

537
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,100
求你以你的真理引导我 教训我 我要怎么做
Guide me in your truth and teach me. What must I do?

538
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,500
我要怎么做
What must I do?

539
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,000
你又过来找我吗
Did you want to see me again?

540
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,900
列丁先生?
Mr. Redding?

541
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,708
艾博特先生怎么样了?
How's Mr. Abbott?

542
00:42:02,709 --> 00:42:04,100
在伯恩茅斯疗养呢
Convalescing in Bournemouth.

543
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,200
某些人的恶作剧
Someone's idea of a joke.

544
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,400
不 不 不
No, no. No.

545
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,300
我是斯莱克警督
Detective Inspector Slack.

546
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,500
我是伦奥纳德・克莱蒙特 这里的牧师
Leonard Clement. I'm the vicar.

547
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,000
从领子就看出来了 医生到了吗
The collar's a clue. Is the doctor here?

548
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:41,900
到了
Yes.

549
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,800
伦 发生什么事了
Len, what's going on?

550
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,000
粗略估计 刚死了半个小时
HaIf an hour, at a guess.

551
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,900
我开始检查的时候肯定不超过三十分钟
Certainly no more than 30 minutes before my examination.

552
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:57,900
那就是什么时候
Which was when?

553
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,200
呃 牧师刚好在六点三刻发现他的
Well, the vicar found him at just gone quarter to seven.

554
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,400
我就在这附近 当我6点50分到好了
I'm only down the road... Say I got here at ten to.

555
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,300
时间掐得真准
Almost spot on.

556
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,000
死亡时间大概是6点20分
Time of death about 6:20, then.

557
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,100
不用大概了
Better than almost.

558
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,900
给他点奖励吧
Give the man a coconut.

559
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,300
"亲爱的牧师
"Dear Vicar,

560
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,900
恐怕我不能再等了
I'm afraid I cannot wait for you any longer,

561
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,300
但我必须"
but must..."

562
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,500
- 就写到这里 - 被枪杀的?
- That's it. - Pistol?

563
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,400
是的
Yes.

564
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,700
这扇门总是开着的吗
Are these always open?

565
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,400
通常在这样的天气都开着
Usually, in this weather.

566
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,900
这么说 牧师接到假电话被叫出去
So, the vicar's called away with a bogus message,

567
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:09,000
凶手通过花园进来
murderer comes in through the garden.

568
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,900
死者当时背对着凶手在写便条
Victim writing a note with back turned.

569
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,000
这就是作案的手法和时间
That's how and when.

570
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,300
剩下的就是动机和凶手身份了
Just why and who?

571
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,900
住在对面小屋的那位女士...
The lady in the cottage with a view of the back here...

572
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,000
- 马普尔小姐? - 我要跟她谈谈
- Miss. Marple? - I need to interview her.

573
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,700
你能一起来吗 这些老处女很容易紧张
Would you tag along? These old maids tend to get nervous.

574
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,700
如果你不是很确定的话
If you're not quite sure of something

575
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:51,400
我会让你慢慢想起来的
I'll wait until you have a little think.

576
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,500
大约6点20分左右
Did you see anyone enter the vicarage

577
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,500
你有没有看见过谁进了寓所?
around 20 past six?

578
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,400
有 普罗瑟罗太太
Yes. Mrs. Protheroe.

579
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,100
你觉得他是那个时候遇害的吗
Is that when you think he was killed?

580
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:02,600
目前显示是这样
It looks like it.

581
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,200
你听力怎么样
How's your hearing?

582
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,700
非常好
It's excellent.

583
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:11,300
那你有听到寓所传来的枪响吗
So you would have heard a gun fired from the vicarage?

584
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,600
这说不准 我确实听到了枪响
It's hard to say. I did hear a shot

585
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,500
大概六点半 我还以为是树林传来的
about 6:30 in the woods, I thought,

586
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,400
这并不奇怪 但是
which is not unusual, but...

587
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,600
谁能分辨得清呢
Whether one could tell the difference...

588
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,200
那个画家列丁先生呢
What about this artist, Mr Redding?

589
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,000
嗯 他看上去非常震惊
Well, he looked terribly shocked.

590
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,700
我猜是因为他发现了尸体
I assumed he'd discovered the body.

591
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,200
当然了 他和上校之间
Of course, he and the colonel...

592
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:39,100
他画过莱蒂斯的泳衣肖像
He'd been painting Lettice,in a bathing suit.

593
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,400
噢 前卫派 是这样叫吧
Oh,avant-garde. Is that the term?

594
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,500
我不相信
I don't believe it.

595
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,300
什么 在牧师寓所里?
What? At the vicarage?

596
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,000
- 是的 夫人 - 安妮?
- Yes, ma'am. - Anne?

597
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,400
卢修斯死了
Lucius is dead.

598
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,400
这是真的吗 豪伊斯先生
Is it really true, Mr Hawes?

599
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,400
- 我在车站听说了 - 是的
- I heard it at the station. - Yes.

600
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,100
我现在正要去牧师寓所
I'm on my way to the vicarage.

601
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:18,800
- 那里有很多血吧 - 我怎么会知道呢
- Was there much blood? - How would I know that?

602
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
不对
No.

603
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,500
你说这会不会是激情犯罪
Do you think it was a crime of passion?

604
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:25,600
毕竟 普罗瑟罗太太和列丁先生
After all, Mrs Protheroe and Mr Redding...

605
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,300
淫乱必会得到惩罚
Fornication always has consequences,

606
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,400
但我觉得我们不该草率下定论
but I don't think we should jump to conclusions.

607
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,800
上校并不怎么讨人喜欢 对吧
The colonel was not much liked by anyone, was he?

608
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,700
嗯 恐怕是这样
No. I'm afraid not.

609
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,400
当然 他和牧师的会面
Of course, his appointment

610
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,600
也不是什么秘密
with the vicar was hardly a secret.

611
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
圣玛丽・米德还能有什么秘密
Are there any secrets in St Mary Mead?

612
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:45,100
还多着呢 我希望
Lots. Yet. I hope.

613
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,000
我想找人谈谈
I want to talk to someone.

614
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,928
什么时候的事?
When was this?

615
00:46:56,929 --> 00:46:58,500
玛丽没听到些什么吗
Didn't Mary hear anything?

616
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:01,600
她如常把收音机开到最大声了
Her wireless was turned up full blast as usual.

617
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,900
不 等我到那里后再说
No. Wait till I get there.

618
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:06,200
但她确实听到上校打了个很响的喷嚏
She did hear the colonel sneeze very loudly.

619
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,500
谁在审讯他 我马上过去
Who's speaking to him? I'll be right there.

620
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:11,600
作案手法 时间 凶手都齐了
That's how, when and who.

621
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,100
只剩动机了
Now for why

622
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:18,600
劳伦斯・列丁刚刚去警察局自首了
Lawrence Redding just walked into the station and confessed,

623
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:21,100
还带了作案凶器
and he's brought the murder weapon.

624
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:22,700
晚安
Good night.

625
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,000
这里是老屋
Old Hall.

626
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,300
这太可怕了
It is terrible.

627
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,500
当然 我们今天下午就坐火车离开了
We will leave on the afternoon train, of course.

628
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:41,500
警察知道谁是凶手了吗
Has the police an idea of who could do this thing?

629
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,700
我知道
I have.

630
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:47,900
是警方的电话 太太
It's the police, madam.

631
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,600
抱歉失陪
Excuse me.

632
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:57,100
不 警督 不可能 他 我不能
No, Inspector, he can't. He... I can't...

633
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:03,800
为什么斯莱克警督
Why does Inspector Slack

634
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,500
会认为上校是在6点20分被杀的呢
think the coloneI was shot at 20 past six?

635
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:09,500
他正好在写便条告诉牧师 他不能再等了
He'd started writing a note to vicar saying he couldn't wait

636
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,400
- 还写上了时间 - 是吗
- He'd put the time on it. - Had he?

637
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,100
而且闹钟刚好停在了6点20分
And the clock stopped at just gone 6:20.

638
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,700
他中弹时把闹钟打到在地上
He knocked it off the desk when he took the bullet.

639
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:20,100
噢 天啊
Oh, dear.

640
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:25,500
恐怕我必须去给警督添麻烦了
I'm afraid I must put a cat amongst the Inspector's pigeons.

641
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,900
他一直在讲他的女儿
He was going on and on about his daughter,

642
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,100
但那只是他女儿对我愚蠢的迷恋
which was just her silly little crush,

643
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,200
所以我告诉他
so I told him it was his wife

644
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,600
他该担心的人是他妻子 我只是想让他闭嘴
he had to worry about, just to shut him up.

645
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:38,100
然后他就暴跳如雷
Then he really started.

646
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,600
我当时想到我这样做 安妮将受到的...
I thought about what I was leaving her to...

647
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:43,300
于是我就杀了他
and I shot him.

648
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,500
局长让我向您问好
The Chief Constable sends his regards.

649
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:10,100
真是太有心了
Isn't that lovely?

650
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:13,400
我偶尔给过他一些帮助
I have been of some assistance to him from time to time.

651
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,300
这点他也说了
He said.

652
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:18,400
是那个闹钟的问题
It's the clock.

653
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:21,100
我碰巧知道克莱蒙特太太
I happen to know Mrs Clement

654
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:23,300
在礼拜日那天 为了牧师能够守时
put it a quarter of an hour fast on Sunday

655
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,500
把闹钟拨快了一刻钟
to improve the vicar's punctuality.

656
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,000
噢 不错 这方法有用吗
Well, wonderful. Did it work?

657
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,000
- 有用 - 那还真不错
- Yes. - I'm glad to hear it.

658
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,900
所以 要么钟真的是在6点5分的时候停了
So, either it was really five past six when it stopped,

659
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:36,200
而那时上校根本还没抵达寓所
before the colonel even arrived for his appointment,

660
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,800
要么就是凶手为了配合字条上的时间
or the murderer moved the hands back

661
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,400
移动了分针
to match the time on the note.

662
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:43,900
那个艺术家还是有嫌疑啊
It still fits,the artistic touch.

663
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:46,700
但列丁先生6点20分的时候在小路上
But Mr Redding was in the lane at 20 past six.

664
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:47,933
我看到他了
I saw him.

665
00:49:47,934 --> 00:49:50,000
或许你是看到他了 马普尔小姐
You may well have done, Miss Marple,

666
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,200
但他是在6点40分杀的上校
but he killed the colonel at 6.45.

667
00:49:52,201 --> 00:49:53,300
玛丽开门给他的
Mary let him in.

668
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:56,200
- 牧师也看到他离开了 - 6点45分?
- The vicar saw him leave. - 6:45?

669
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,500
但检验的死亡时间误差不超过十分钟
But I only examined at ten to.

670
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:59,700
那就是说 他的死亡时间
And told me that he'd died

671
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:03,100
- 就在那三十分钟之内 - 是的 要我说
- within the last 30 minutes. - At the most, I said.

672
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,700
6点20分或者更早一点 有可能
6:20 or a little before, yes.

673
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:08,700
6点30分 最多就是6点40分
6:30...6.40 at a pinch,

674
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:11,807
但若列丁先生说他是在6点45分杀他的话
but if Redding says he shot him at 6:45,

675
00:50:11,808 --> 00:50:12,500
他就是在说谎
he's lying.

676
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,300
那法医就不能有错吗
And doctors are never wrong?

677
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,000
我这有一份自首供词
I've got a confession.

678
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,900
如果上校脑子里的子弹
If the bullet killing the colonel doesn't

679
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:23,100
和列丁的枪不吻合 我就吃了我的手铐
match Redding's gun, I'll eat my handcuffs.

680
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:27,400
有时候 事情就是这么简单
Sometimes, the simple explanation is the right one.

681
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,600
昨晚则是个例外
Last night's wasn't.

682
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,100
我会找人送你们出去的
I'll have someone see you out.

683
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,500
如果他是在6点45分中弹的话
If he was shot at a quarter to seven,

684
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,600
为什么他6点20分的那句话
why had he stopped in the middle of a sentence

685
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,100
才写到一半
at 20 past six?

686
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:00,300
- 安妮 - 我要给警方打电话
- Anne... - I have to telephone the police.

687
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:01,500
我希望有人陪着我
I'd like someone with me.

688
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,500
- 他是我杀的 - 什么时候杀的
- I killed him. - What time?

689
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,000
马普尔小姐看到我大概是6点20分走的
Miss Marple saw me going at about 20 past six.

690
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,200
我只是
I just...

691
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,700
我只是太恨他了 所以开枪杀了他
I just hated him so much, I shot him.

692
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:19,800
用什么杀的
With?

693
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,500
他那把旧警枪
His old service revolver

694
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,300
他一直给枪上好子弹 我就拿了
He always kept it loaded and I took it.

695
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,468
安妮 你没有带枪
Anne, you didn't have a gun.

696
00:51:28,469 --> 00:51:30,700
我放在包里了
It was in my bag.

697
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,400
你没有带包
You didn't have a bag.

698
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:35,100
你穿的那条裙子也藏不了枪
There was nowhere else it could have been, not in that dress

699
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,600
圣玛丽・米德村23...
St Mary Mead 23...

700
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,100
是的 请讲
Yes, speaking.

701
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,800
确定吗
Is that definite?

702
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,800
好的
Right.

703
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:55,500
我不喜欢浪费时间 普罗瑟罗太太
I don't like my time wasted, Mrs Protheroe.

704
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:56,900
杀死你丈夫的那颗子弹
The bullet that killed your husband

705
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:58,800
是从列丁先生的枪里射出的
was fired from Mr Redding's gun.

706
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,564
但他是为了我这样做的
But he did it for me.

707
00:52:02,565 --> 00:52:04,100
他并没有为了谁这样做
He didn't do it for anyone.

708
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,100
我半小时前就释放他了
I released him half an hour ago.

709
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:10,500
虽然我不相信
He just happened to be carrying his gun

710
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,000
但他只是碰巧带着他的枪
which I don't believe.

711
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,600
更重要的是 这点你也没有想到吧
And more important, and something that you didn't think of,

712
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:18,200
如果上校是在6点45分被枪杀
if the coloneI was shot at a quarter to seven,

713
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:21,200
为什么他6点20分的纸条写到一半呢
why did he stop the note like that at 6:20?

714
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:24,800
- 噢 是啊 - 对吧
- Oh, yes. - Hm-hm.

715
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,400
呃
Er...

716
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,600
- 但如果是他的枪 - 我们会查清楚的
- But if it was his gun... - We'll find out.

717
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,900
他以为我会因谋杀罪而拘捕你
He thinks I'm arresting you for murder.

718
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,200
- 安妮! - 劳伦斯!
- Anne! - Lawrence!

719
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,300
用爱之吻来黏信封?
Sealed with a loving kiss?

720
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,300
这是给我们家弗兰克的
It's to my Frank.

721
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,600
在他不用挖矿劳作的时候
Is he allowed to receive letters

722
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,500
能被允许收信的吗
when he's not breaking rocks?

723
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:57,600
他才没有在做苦工
He ain't doing hard labour.

724
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,200
但谁能想到呢 列丁先生
Who would have thought it, though? Mr Redding.

725
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,900
这么好的一个年轻人
Such a nice young man.

726
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:05,000
好到在家里藏着根枪?
Nice enough to keep a gun in the house?

727
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,150
我觉得是普罗瑟罗太太的错
I blame that Mrs Protheroe.

728
00:53:07,151 --> 00:53:08,500
看她到处招摇的样子
The way she swans around.

729
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,800
看那架势 还以为是杂志里面跑出来的呢
You'd think she was in a magazine, the look of her.

730
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,300
依我说 是她让列丁先生这样做的
She put Mr Redding up to it, if you ask me.

731
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,600
麻烦请让一下
Excuse me.

732
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,800
我的足球彩票
My football pools.

733
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,500
世事难料 我上周刚错过了1000英镑
You never know. I only just missed out on ￡1,000 last week.

734
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:23,900
金钱是一切罪恶的种子
Money is the root of all evil.

735
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,600
那我倒是愿意在花园里种着
I'd give it space in my garden.

736
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,500
再见
Bye.

737
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:32,000
噢 我还是 我可不想乱说话
Oh, I'd better... I don't want to speak out of turn,

738
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,700
特别是没什么事的话
especially if it wasn't anything.

739
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,800
警察释放了劳伦斯
The police have released Lawrence.

740
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:41,000
- 列丁先生 - 是吗 那我想
- Mr Redding. - Have they? Then, I wonder...

741
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,900
这一定让你很不安吧
This must be so unsettling for you.

742
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:46,300
我受不了了
I can't bear it.

743
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,600
我正要去教堂 克莱蒙特太太
I was on my way to the church, Mrs Clement.

744
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,800
要和我一起去祷告吗
Shall we pray together?

745
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:53,600
呃 我 我要去找查尔斯沃思先生
Erm...I...I need to find Mr Charlesworth

746
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,700
要赶在他关门去吃午餐前
before he closes for lunch.

747
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:55,900
我需要那些
I need some of those...

748
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,900
噢 随便你们怎么称呼吧 锋利好用的
Oh, whatever you call them! Good and sharp.

749
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:12,800
普罗瑟罗太太离开我的视线顶多三十秒
Mrs Protheroe was only out of sight for 30 seconds at most

750
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:14,900
然后她就去了小屋
then she went into the shed.

751
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:17,100
列丁先生沿小路过去和她见面
Mr Redding joined her from the lane.

752
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:20,600
他跟我说他要和她道别 他要离开这村子了
He told me he was saying goodbye to her, leaving the village

753
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,400
她一定非常难过
She must have been terribly upset.

754
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:25,600
他们大概在那里呆了十分钟
They stayed there for ten minutes or so.

755
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,400
教堂的钟响起了半小时报时
The church clock struck a half hour.

756
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,000
他们就出来了 遇上了杜福斯先生
They came out again, meeting Monsieur Dufosse,

757
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,300
他刚好从通向老屋的路走来
who appeared from the footpath to Old Hall.

758
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,500
然后他的孙女也到了
Then his granddaughter arrived.

759
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:39,900
- 杜福斯? - 恩 普罗瑟罗家的客人
- Dufosse? - Mm. Guests of the Protheroes.

760
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:42,700
你为什么不把门锁好
You don't keep it shut away?

761
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,800
是 是 我知道我该锁好门
Yes, yes, I know, I know I should.

762
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,400
帮我打扫的塔兰特太太
Mrs Tarrant who mucks me out

763
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,000
总是叫我把门锁好
is always telling me off about that,

764
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:49,700
而我白天从来不锁门
and I never lock up during the day.

765
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:50,600
你还记得起
Did you recognise...

766
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:51,700
在枪出现在书房之前
When was the last time

767
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:53,800
你最后一次看见它是什么时候吗
you saw the gun before it turned up in the study?

768
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,100
呃 前天吧
Erm...the day before yesterday.

769
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:57,500
你能认出那个声音
Did you recognise the voice...

770
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:00,500
你不用让你的脚踝休息一下吗 马普尔小姐
Wouldn't you prefer to rest your ankle, Miss Marple?

771
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,900
不用了 谢谢关心 你能认出电话里的声音吗
No, thank you. Did you recognise the voice on the telephone?

772
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:07,400
不 电话里说如果不想让卢修斯知道我俩的事
No. It just said to come straight over to the vicarage

773
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,500
就直接过去牧师寓所
if I didn't want Lucius to find out about us.

774
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:11,900
- 男的还是女的 - 我想是女的
- A man or woman? - A woman. I think.

775
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,700
听起来很模糊
It did sound quite faint

776
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:16,400
就像是那人把话筒握得很远
as if someone was holding the receiver away from them.

777
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:17,863
所以也可能是个男的
So it could have been a man.

778
00:55:17,864 --> 00:55:19,000
明察秋毫嘛 牧师
Well spotted, Vicar.

779
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,177
谁会知道你当时在马普尔小姐家
Who knew you were at Miss Marple's?

780
00:55:21,178 --> 00:55:21,700
没有谁啊
No one.

781
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,500
那人一定是看到我在那
Someone must have seen me arrive.

782
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:30,800
呃 监视着我
Er...watching me.

783
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:33,600
我丈夫也死了 我
My husband's dead. I...

784
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:39,200
就是说 你穿过花园 来到落地窗前
So, you came through the garden, and up to the French windows

785
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,900
之后发生了什么事
and then what happened?

786
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,600
是的 窗子是开着的 但我没听到什么声音
Yes, they were open, but I didn't hear any voices.

787
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,300
我看到屋里没有人 所以就去了小屋
I looked in and no-one was here, so I went up to the shed

788
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:50,700
去看能不能找到劳伦斯
to see if I could find Lawrence.

789
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,600
屋里没有人 那不可能啊
No one here? That's impossible.

790
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,100
你有走进去吗
Did you come right in?

791
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,600
没有 我只是 伸头往里看了下
No. I just...popped my head in.

792
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:00,600
啊 这可真是世上最大的一叶兰了
Ah. It's the biggest aspidistra in the world.

793
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,100
如果上校是坐在书桌这边
If the coloneI was here at the desk

794
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:04,800
是死是活 你都是看不到他的
you wouldn't have seen him alive or dead.

795
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,300
坐下吧
Sit down.

796
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,600
你去蓝野猪旅馆喝了一杯
A drink at the Blue Boar

797
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,300
然后又回来找牧师
then you returned to see the vicar again

798
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:14,700
说说你的状况 然后呢
about your situation, and then what?

799
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,500
这次该说实话了
The authorised version this time.

800
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,900
我走进去 他已经死了 我看到了我的枪
I came in. He was dead. I saw my gun.

801
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,400
我还以为是安妮终于受够他了
I thought that Anne had finally had enough

802
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,200
所以我捡起了枪
so I picked it up

803
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,427
然后就离开了
and I left.

804
00:56:24,428 --> 00:56:26,200
之后你为了保护她去自首
And you confessed to protect her.

805
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:27,900
然后你又用这招去保护他
And you returned the favour

806
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:29,600
因为你以为真是他做的
because you thought he'd done it.

807
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,200
多么浪漫的爱情故事
Very love's young dream.

808
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,700
我猜你们俩每周五都去看话剧吧
I bet you two are down the Odeon every Friday.

809
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:35,800
告诉你的客人 我要跟他们谈话
Tell your guests I need to speak to them.

810
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,000
除非我同意
Don't think about

811
00:56:37,001 --> 00:56:40,000
不然他们别想能离开这村子 走吧
leaving this village until I say so. Go.

812
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,800
呃 抱歉
Erm... Sorry.

813
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,000
麻烦让一下
Excuse me.

814
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:58,200
你不喜欢克莱蒙特先生 对吧
You don't like Mr Clement, do you?

815
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,900
没有针对他
Nothing personal.

816
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:05,100
只是 牧师们总让我想起婚姻
Vicars in general...remind me of marriage.

817
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:09,100
- 啊 当然了 - 当然什么
- Ah...of course. - Of course what?

818
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,700
哈特内尔小姐表姐的女仆
Miss Hartnell's cousin's maid

819
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:12,800
正在和来自梅尔切斯特的屠夫儿子约会
is just walking out with a butcher's boy from Melchester

820
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,500
这让你的岳母很受打击
who delivers to your mother-in-Law.

821
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,800
斯莱克太太已经和她相处了
Mrs Slack has been staying with her for a...

822
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,300
有一个小假期了吧 算起来
little holiday, I gather.

823
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:24,100
到目前为止 是两个月又六天的小假期了
A little two-month six-day holiday, so far.

824
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,800
- 噢 天啊 - 嗯
- Oh, dear. - Hm.

825
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:29,300
当然了
Of course

826
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:32,000
我只听说了克莱蒙特先生对那通假电话的说法
I've only got Mr Clement's word about the bogus call.

827
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,900
当然 你不会怀疑他吧?
Surely you don't suspect him?

828
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,500
- 呃 - 我可以看看吗
- Erm... - May I?

829
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:38,900
当然
Please.

830
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:43,100
6点20分
6:20.

831
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,900
"恐怕我不能再等了"
"I'm afraid I cannot wait for you any longer."

832
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:50,800
上校他 确实不是很有耐心的人
The colonel was...not the most patient of men,

833
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,500
但如果是6点20分的话
but the vicar would only have been

834
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:54,000
牧师也不过是迟了五分钟啊
five minutes late at 20 past six.

835
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,200
在上校进门的时候 玛丽也提醒过了
Mary had warned him he wouldn't be on time

836
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,300
牧师会晚一点回来
when she showed him in.

837
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:00,100
嗯 6点20分
Hm. 6:20.

838
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:04,000
你不觉得 这个墨水是
The ink is...don't you think,

839
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:06,700
蓝黑色的
blue-black,

840
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:08,400
而不是蓝色的吗
rather than blue?

841
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:12,000
- 是啊 字也相对小一点 - 嗯
- Yes, and the writing's smaller. - Mm.

842
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:15,100
谢谢你 马普尔小姐
Thank you, Miss Marple.

843
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:18,700
那就是说 他可能是6点20分之后被杀的
That means he could have been shot after 6:20,

844
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:21,100
而字条上的时间是凶手加上去的
and then the murderer put that onto the note

845
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,500
凶手还把闹钟拨到
and then altered the clock...

846
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,600
拨到普罗瑟罗太太接完那通匿名电话
...to the time when Mrs Protheroe came here

847
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,500
来到书房时的时间
in answer to her anonymous telephone call.

848
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:30,800
并且用列丁先生的枪做凶器
And Mr Redding's gun as the murder weapon.

849
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:34,900
我想他们是被 呃
I think they were being...er...

850
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,400
设计成替罪羔羊了
...set up as pasties.

851
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:41,400
替罪羔羊 确实
Patsies...it is.

852
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
嗯
Mm.

853
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:47,300
谢谢你 警督
Thank you, Inspector.

854
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:51,900
抱歉 抱歉 我待会再过来 我是来找些
Sorry. Sorry, I'll come back. I was looking for some...

855
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,800
你坐的正好是他被杀的位置 对吧
You're exactly where he was killed, aren't you?

856
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:57,800
真是可怕 你们知道谁是凶手了吗
How horrible. Do you know who did it?

857
00:58:58,100 --> 00:58:59,500
不 还没有
Not yet, no.

858
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:04,300
主说"伸冤在我 我必报应"
"'Vengeance is mine. I will repay,' saith the Lord."

859
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,100
但看来有人比主抢先了一步
Well, someone beat the Lord to it.

860
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,800
我要倒些水 该吃药了
I need some water. For my medicine.

861
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
但如果他是6点30分被杀的
But supposing he was killed at 6:30?

862
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,000
那就和你听到的那下枪声吻合了
That would tie in with the shot that you heard.

863
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,600
如果枪声是从这里传来的话
If it was from here.

864
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:22,500
你确定在6点20分的时候
You're sure the only person you saw come in

865
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,000
你只看到过普罗瑟罗太太进去吗
was Mrs Protheroe at 6:20?

866
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,500
从花园进去的话 我确定
Through the garden, certainly

867
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:28,300
但是从我的小屋没办法看到落地窗
but I can't see the French windows from my cottage.

868
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:30,600
而且树木也在这边挡着视线
and the woods come right up on this side.

869
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,500
虽然有点麻烦 但如果凶手早有预谋
It would be a scramble, but if one was determined

870
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,100
或者凶手从前厅进来的
or if one came in through the hall.

871
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,581
上校耳朵不好使
The colonel was deaf,

872
00:59:36,582 --> 00:59:39,000
那他们就可以偷偷地躲在他后面
so they could creep up behind him.

873
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,200
前厅?不 不可能
The hall? No, no

874
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,700
这样就需要玛丽给他们开大门了
cos Mary would have let them in the front door.

875
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:43,600
她没有告诉你这门通常是开着的吗
Hasn't she told you it's often left open?

876
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:48,800
玛丽!
Mary!

877
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:01,700
你自己能行吗
Is this wise?

878
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:03,000
你并不擅长园艺
You're not exactly green-fingered.

879
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,800
噢 别大惊小怪的 亲爱的 相信我
Oh, don't fuss, darling! Trust me.

880
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:10,100
把那本剪刀一样的东西递给我 好吗
Pass those scissory things, would you?

881
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:10,100
{\a6}牧师收

882
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:12,800
伦?
Len?

883
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,900
不好意思
Sorry.

884
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:19,700
谢谢 哎呦
Thank you. Ooh!

885
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:35,800
{\a6}但要免淫乱的事 男子当各有自己的妻子 女子也当各有自己的丈夫

886
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:35,800
看好你的妻子 第七章 第二节
WATCH YOUR WIFE CHAPTER 7 VERSE 2

887
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:52,600
- 噢 - 抱歉吓到你了 莱蒂斯
- Oh! - Sorry to startle you, Lettice.

888
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:58,200
- 对你的遭遇 我深表同情 - 噢 是的
- You have my deepest sympathy. - Oh. Yes.

889
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,800
嗯 你发现自己身上沾到颜料了吗
Mm. Do you know you've got some paint on you?

890
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:06,700
很久之前沾上的了 我要让人洗干净才行
That's been there ages. I must have it cleaned.

891
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,100
你有看到一顶黄色的贝雷帽吗
You haven't seen a yellow beret?

892
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:12,100
- 没有 - 我很确定我漏在这里了
- No. - I'm sure I left it in here last week

893
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:14,400
- 上星期来找丹尼斯的时候 - 我很遗憾
- when I came to see Dennis. - I'm sorry.

894
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:30,000
你?做园艺?
You? Gardening?

895
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,600
我总得找点事情做吧
Well, I have to do something.

896
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:38,000
- 你昨天买什么回来了 - 什么
- What did you bring back yesterday? - Hm?

897
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:41,800
- 从伦敦啊 - 噢 是的 伦敦
- From London. - Oh, yes, London.

898
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,600
- 我没找到合心的 - 这可不像你啊
- I couldn't find a thing I wanted. - Not like you.

899
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,500
- 再见 - 再见
- Bye. - Bye.

900
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,800
我和摄影师私下谈过了
I had a man-to-man word with the photographer.

901
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:22,900
- 他说会寄给我 - 嘘 让我好好看看你
- He said he'd send me - Shh! Let me just look at you.

902
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:55,300
- 他明天就准备收拾离开了 - 真遗憾
- He'll start clearing it out tomorrow. - It's a shame.

903
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:58,600
他已经开始捕捉到我的神韵了 你说呢
He was on his way to getting me. Don't you think?

904
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,100
是吗
Was he?

905
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:05,600
噢 你这个傻瓜
Oh, you silly man!

906
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:07,500
的确 他是有魅力
Yes, he's charming,

907
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,700
的确  他就像是拂过田野的一缕清风
yes, he's like a breath of fresh air in the village

908
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,100
的确 他也逗过我高兴 不过
yes, I was flattered, but...

909
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:12,900
不可能的
no.

910
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,600
你才是我的丈夫 伦
You are my husband, Len.

911
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,600
我永远不会欺骗你的
I would never deceive you.

912
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,600
除非是善意的
Unless it was for the best.

913
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:45,900
后脑处有一处枪伤
There was a single bullet wound to the back of the head,

914
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:48,800
我推断这就是死因
which I concluded was the cause of death.

915
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,700
你能给出死亡时间的正式估计吗 海多克医生
Did you fomarlly estimate the time of death, Dr Haydock?

916
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:55,700
大概是在6点20分到6点40分之间
Between 6:20 or thereabouts and 6.40 at the latest.

917
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,000
谢谢你
Thank you

918
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:02,600
我在6点15分开门给他后 就回到了厨房
I showed him in at 6:15 and then went back to the kitchen.

919
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,900
但他看起来似乎很高兴
He wasn't half looking pleased with himself

920
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:07,100
就像猫捉到老鼠一样
though, like the cat that got the cream.

921
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:10,000
大概五分钟之后 我听到
Then I heard him give a blooming great sneeze

922
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,600
他打了个响嚏
about five minutes after,

923
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:13,900
再后来我见到他时
and the next time I see him,

924
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:15,804
他已经死了
he was dead.

925
01:04:15,805 --> 01:04:17,600
很好 希尔小姐 下去吧
Very well, Miss Hill. Step down.

926
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:24,200
你知道是上校判她未婚夫入狱的吗
Did you know the colonel sent her young man to prison?

927
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,100
弗兰克・塔兰特
Frank Tarrant.

928
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:28,200
最后 普罗瑟罗太太 你能想到
Lastly, Mrs Protheroe, can you think of anyone

929
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,200
有谁会想杀害你丈夫的吗
who might have wished your husband harm?

930
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:37,100
不 恐怕我想不出
No. No-one at all, I'm afraid.

931
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:40,000
- 谢谢你 - 但是
- Thank you. - Although...

932
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:43,200
- 请讲 - 礼拜一在梅尔切斯特商业街上
- Yes? - On Monday in Melchester High Street,

933
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,700
他差点被一辆摩托车给撞了
he was nearly hit by a motorcycle.

934
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,800
你是想说那是故意的?
Are you suggesting this was deliberate?

935
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,300
当时看起来倒不像是
It didn't seem so at the time.

936
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:51,900
我只是觉得我应该提一下
I just thought I should mention it.

937
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:00,200
我判定死者
I find that the deceased

938
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,500
卢修斯・亚历山大・普罗瑟罗上校
Colonel Lucius Alexander Protheroe,

939
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:06,200
是被未知的一人或多人所谋杀
was murdered by a person or persons unknown.

940
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,600
你怀疑那辆摩托车有问题吗
Did you wonder about the motorbike?

941
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:16,300
我想它只是开得过快了
It was just going too fast, I thought.

942
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:17,900
但他当时确实就差一点儿
He did come very close, though.

943
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:20,300
他还是她 谁说得准呢
He or she. One couldn't tell.

944
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,600
话说回来 礼拜二下午
By the way, when the colonel

945
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,900
上校在梅尔切斯特呆了那么晚
stayed late in Melchester on Tuesday afternoon,

946
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:25,973
他在做什么呢
what was he doing?

947
01:05:25,974 --> 01:05:28,000
我想 是去见罗斯・哈金斯太太吧
Meeting Mrs Ross-Harkins, I think.

948
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,481
赫麦亚妮吗 她是主教的妻子
Hermione? The bishop's wife,

949
01:05:30,482 --> 01:05:31,900
也是他的法官同僚
and his fellow magistrate too.

950
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:33,700
警督 请你一定要找出凶手
Inspector, please find out who did this.

951
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:35,600
如果有人故意陷害
If someone tried to make it look as if...

952
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,700
那他们一定是很恨我和劳伦斯 而且 呃
Well, they must hate Lawrence and me very much, and er...

953
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:43,400
嗯 我很害怕
Well, I'm scared.

954
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,500
等一下
Wait.

955
01:05:58,600 --> 01:05:59,600
噢
Oh.

956
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:02,200
这是在落地窗外面找到的
This was outside the French windows.

957
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:05,000
牧师家没人抽烟
No one at the vicarage smokes.

958
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:08,000
- 是丹尼斯偷偷藏的吧 - 你闻下
- Dennis sneaking a crafty one? - Sniff.

959
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:13,400
法国的 很久之前 去休假的年轻人
French. Young men on leave a long time ago

960
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,700
他们会从法国带这个回来
they'd bring them back from France.

961
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:19,600
我怀疑 杜福斯先生从小路走出来的时候
When Monsieur Dufosse appeared on the footpath,

962
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,300
是不是刚从树林里出去的
I wonder if he'd only just turned into it from the woods.

963
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:24,200
你看 事情发生之后
Look, it's easy to imagine

964
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:26,100
很容易会有各种各样的猜想
all kinds of things after the event,

965
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:27,700
但是事情其实很简单
but the simple fact is...

966
01:06:27,701 --> 01:06:28,900
谋杀从来不简单
Murder is never simple.

967
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,200
如果我们放弃任何线索 那就太愚笨了
We would be foolish, stupid, to ignore any possibility.

968
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:35,500
我们?
We?

969
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:38,600
我说了我们吗
Did I say that?

970
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,500
真是抱歉
So sorry.

971
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,300
我也不知道该送她一盒巧克力
I don't know whether to buy her a box of chocs

972
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:51,800
还是踢开她的拐杖
or kick away her stick.

973
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:54,200
我更喜欢巧克力
I'd prefer the chocolates.

974
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:04,700
你没有穿黑色真是太棒了 那太沮丧了
How marvellous that you're not in black. It's so dreary.

975
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,900
- 我该认识你吗 - 我想让你认识
- Should I know you? - I want you to.

976
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:11,300
- 你是谁 - 啊 "西尔维娅是谁
- Who are you? - Ah."Who is Sylvia?

977
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:13,000
她是什么样的人呢"
What is she?"

978
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,600
我们来慢慢聊
Let's have a little chat.

979
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,700
我沿着小路散了一会步
I made a walk along the footpath.

980
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:22,200
景色很美丽
It is very beautiful.

981
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:25,200
你有进去过树林吗 杜福斯先生
Did you go into the woods, Mr Dufosse?

982
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:28,200
没有 只是在小路上散步
No. Footpath only.

983
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,900
你什么时候回去法国
When do you go back to France?

984
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:35,900
我们现在已经误了搭联运车的时间
We have missed the good connection now.

985
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,900
明天坐首班火车离开
Tomorrow by the first train.

986
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:40,000
我可能还需要联系你们
I might need to get in touch with you.

987
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:43,700
你们的杂志社叫什么名字
What's this magazine of yours called?

988
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,200
麻烦把它拼出来
You'll have to spell it.

989
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,600
主教和他太太明天才能回来吗
And the bishop and his wife get back tomorrow?

990
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:54,300
麻烦转告赫麦亚妮 让他们一回到
Would you please be kind to ask Hermione to telephone me

991
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:56,100
梅尔切斯特就给我打个电话
as soon as they get back to Melchester?

992
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:58,800
我是简・马普尔
Jane Marple.

993
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:01,700
或许 是的
It might, yes.

994
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,100
的确是非常重要
Very important indeed.

995
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,300
安妮拿到了屋子
Anne gets the hall.

996
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:13,900
但你也可以自己安顿下来
But you can set up on your own.

997
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:15,300
我会帮你找地方的
I'll help you look for somewhere.

998
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,119
他才去世了两天
He's only been dead two days.

999
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:18,900
所以呢 你讨厌他啊
So? You hated him.

1000
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:20,900
- 凶手是在帮你忙呢 - 丹尼斯
- The killer did you a favour. - Dennis!

1001
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:22,800
- 我说的是实话 - 我会回屋了
- It's true. - I'm going in.

1002
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,200
为什么你跟马普尔小姐说你丢了贝雷帽
Why did you tell Miss Marple you lost your beret?

1003
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:28,204
打网球的时候 你还带着呢
You had it at tennis.

1004
01:08:28,205 --> 01:08:29,000
你在偷听吗
Were you listening?

1005
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:30,700
而且我们还没打完 你就离开了
And you left before we finished the game.

1006
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:32,900
你也很快就走了 园丁告诉我的
And you went soon after. The gardener told me.

1007
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:35,700
是啊 但你总不会觉得我会杀了你父亲吧
Yes. But you don't think I could have killed your father.

1008
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:38,000
你总不会觉得我会那么关心你吧
You don't think I care enough about you.

1009
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:41,900
- 我知道是谁杀的 - 你们在这里啊
- I know who did it. - There you are.

1010
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,800
真是一石二鸟
Two birds, one stone.

1011
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:47,400
或许你们能给我说说
Perhaps you could tell me

1012
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:50,000
你们周二傍晚都在哪里呢
where you both were on Tuesday evening.

1013
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:53,000
我们在一起打网球
Together. We played tennis.

1014
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
然后一起去树林散步了
Then we went for a walk. In the woods.

1015
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
是啊 去了树林 走得挺远
Yes, the woods, rolling around

1016
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,700
差不多都走到本哈姆镇了 真是个美好的夜晚
over towards Much Benham. It was a smashing evening.

1017
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:00,800
对吧
Wasn't it?

1018
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:06,100
你好 托尼对吧 我是琼・哈格里夫斯
Hello, Tony? It's Joan Hargreaves.

1019
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:10,300
我需要你帮忙 你那里离圣玛丽・米德村近吗
I need a favour. Is your place anywhere near St Mary Mead?

1020
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,000
我把账本放在书桌上了
I left the ledgers on the desk

1021
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
这样上校一来 你就可以交给他
so you'd have them to hand when the colonel arrived.

1022
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:19,400
你想会不会是被 凶手拿走了
You don't think the...murderer took them?

1023
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:22,600
不会 我想只是玛丽乱动东西罢了
No. I expect Mary's been moving things.

1024
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,600
话说回来 帐目都整理好了吧
Were they all in order, by the way?

1025
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:27,900
普赖斯・里德利太太那张一磅的钞票
Mrs Price-Ridley's pound note was counted in

1026
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:29,200
算到了义卖的钱里了
with the jumble sale money.

1027
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,900
我回查了过去六个月的帐目
I went back over the last six months

1028
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:32,000
帐面都是平的
and everything balances.

1029
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:33,900
正如我们所说的一样
As we knew it would.

1030
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,100
"私欲生出罪
"Lust bringeth forth sin

1031
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:39,600
而罪生出死"
and sin bringeth forth death."

1032
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,100
我 我不能再呆下去了
I...I can't stay in here.

1033
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:00,700
我不知道该怎么做
I don't know what to do.

1034
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:04,100
突然之间 我们就似乎冷淡了
Suddenly, we just seem so...distant.

1035
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:06,100
你想要怎么做呢
What would you like to do?

1036
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,400
噢
Oh...

1037
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:10,900
离开这里 只有我们两个
Walk away, just the two of us

1038
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,600
一起迎接清新飘雪的早晨
into a crisp and snowy morning.

1039
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:17,200
然后以此作画
Then paint it.

1040
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:23,300
玛丽听到的喷嚏声
The sneeze that Mary heard

1041
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:25,500
有可能是凶手发出的 对吧
that could have been the murderer, couldn't it?

1042
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:27,700
而安妮当时在场
And Anne was there.

1043
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,700
我只希望她平安无事
I just hope she's safe.

1044
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:16,400
你朋友早到了 很好
He is early, your friend. Good.

1045
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:18,700
晚安啊
Bonjour.

1046
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:23,700
你们工作的杂志社战前就倒闭了
The magazine you work for went out of business before war.

1047
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:27,400
好了 你们都拿走了什么 银器吗
Now, what have you got? The silver?

1048
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:33,400
我孙子 恩里
My grandson, Henri.

1049
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,800
他本会成为我的丈夫
He would have been my husband.

1050
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:38,300
我们在1943年相识
We met in 1943

1051
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:39,720
他当时在抵抗部队
He was in the Resistance.

1052
01:11:39,721 --> 01:11:41,400
那你呢 哈格里夫斯小姐
And you, Miss Hargreaves?

1053
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,400
特别行动队
Special Operations.

1054
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:46,900
我被投派到法国 和恩里与他的部队一起工作
I was dropped into France, working with Henri and his crew.

1055
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:50,100
- 上校呢 - 他在伦敦进行指挥工作
- The colonel? - He commanded a desk in London.

1056
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:51,800
他背叛了恩里
Il a trahi Henri.

1057
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:54,200
- 他背叛了他 - 他背叛了我的孙子
- He betrayed him. - He betrayed my grandson.

1058
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:55,500
普罗瑟罗的部门负责
Protheroe's section was responsible

1059
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:57,200
提供我们地区所有的物资
for supplying the whole of our region,

1060
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:59,400
武器 雷管等等
weapons, detonators and so on.

1061
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:02,400
1944年伊始 他必须进行一次投钱行动
Early in'44, he had to organise a money drop

1062
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:05,000
数目上万的法郎现金
tens of thousands of francs in cash.

1063
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:07,900
恩里和我在他给出的地点等待
Henri and I waited at the rendezvous he'd given us,

1064
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:09,200
但飞机飞过去了
but the plane went over

1065
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:10,800
然后在一里外的地方投落了
and dropped the canister a mile away.

1066
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:12,800
- 为什么 - 他给的地点是错的
- Why? - The rendezvous was false.

1067
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:15,400
钱被一个叫拉科姆的男人拿走了
The money was picked up by a man called Lacombe,

1068
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:18,500
他是组织的一员 战前就认识普罗瑟罗
one of our group, who had known Protheroe before the war.

1069
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:20,700
就因为单纯的贪欲
It was simple greed.

1070
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:23,200
战后 他们分了赃
After the war, they divided it between them.

1071
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,700
拉科姆和上校
Lacombe and the colonel.

1072
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:30,600
去年拉科姆在死之前向我坦白了
Lacombe made a confession to me, last year when he was dying

1073
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:33,400
这就是证据 银行转账单 银行结单
That's the proof: bank transfers, statements

1074
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:34,900
拉科姆收到的指示
Lacombe's instructions.

1075
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:36,600
那恩里怎么了
What happened to Henri?

1076
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:38,472
拉科姆向德军透露了我们的行踪
Lacombe had tipped off the Germans

1077
01:12:38,473 --> 01:12:39,300
他们找到了我们
and they came for us.

1078
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:41,300
我逃了出来
I escaped.

1079
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:49,400
- 他却没有 - 他被折磨至死
- He did not. - He was tortured...until death.

1080
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:51,100
我的亲孙子
My grandson.

1081
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:57,400
- 我很遗憾 - 我也是
- I'm very sorry. - And so am I.

1082
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:00,300
我也是 我跟你说实话
So am I. I'll tell you the truth.

1083
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:03,500
我是要去杀了那个混蛋上校的
I had to kill that son of a bitch, the colonel!

1084
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:07,000
因为他 于是
Because of him. And so,

1085
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,800
我带上我的手枪 走过树林
I got my pistol, I went to the woods,

1086
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,200
走到了牧师寓所
up to the vicarage,

1087
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:16,400
穿过落地窗 走进了书房
through the French windows and into the study.

1088
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:19,300
- 啊 - 然后呢 杜福斯先生?
- Ah... - Yes, Mr Dufosse?

1089
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,600
我去晚了
I was too late.

1090
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,800
我去得太他妈晚了
I was too damn late!

1091
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,800
他死了
He was dead.

1092
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:39,100
- 你是说? - 我是说
- Are you saying...? - I'm saying...

1093
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:41,700
他已经死了
he was already dead.

1094
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:44,900
谢谢老天
Thankfully.

1095
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,400
你很会做家务嘛
You're quite good at this.

1096
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,500
- 我必须得学会 - 噢
- I've had to learn - Oh

1097
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,930
所以说 如果他所说的是真的
So,if what he told you is true,

1098
01:14:00,931 --> 01:14:03,100
上校在6点30分前就死了
the colonel was dead by 6:30

1099
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:05,100
那时杜福斯先生和其他人会合了
when Monsieur Dufosse joined the others.

1100
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:08,000
恰好 如果你听到的那下响声正是谋杀枪声
Only just, if the shot you heard was the murder.

1101
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:10,800
- 你相信他所说的吗 - 是的
- Do you believe him? - Yes.

1102
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:12,500
但是奇怪的是
But the interesting thing is

1103
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:14,600
杜福斯在书房所看到的
what Monsieur Dufosse saw in the study.

1104
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:18,100
他形容枪的枪筒很长
He described the gun as having a long barrel,

1105
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:20,600
你知道的 像老式西部片那种
you know, like the old Wild West ones?

1106
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:22,600
而且他看到的便条
And he thought the note

1107
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:26,300
有大半页那么长 而不是只有几行
was a good half page long, not just a couple of lines.

1108
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:27,700
这可真奇怪了
That is interesting.

1109
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:29,700
但我不确定他的话有几分可信
I don't know how reliable he is, though.

1110
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,500
他当时刚从强光的户外进入屋内
He had just come in out of bright sunlight...

1111
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:36,100
而且他年纪也大了
..and he is getting on.

1112
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:39,100
你漏了一点没洗
You've missed a bit.

1113
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:42,900
那便条
The note...

1114
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,800
你给普罗瑟罗太太看过了吗
Have you shown it to Mrs Protheroe?

1115
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:46,500
不 还没有
No, actually.

1116
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:48,600
我想 她正在牧师寓所里呢
She's at the vicarage now, I believe.

1117
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:51,400
安排丧事
Funeral arrangements.

1118
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:56,200
时间和文字都不是他的笔迹
Neither is in his writing, not the time or the words.

1119
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,500
我不明白
I don't understand.

1120
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,500
现在这个调查阶段 大家都糊涂了
You're not alone at this stage of the investigation.

1121
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:04,500
你有上校的字迹模板吗
Do you have any examples of the colonel's handwriting?

1122
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:05,800
当然
Yes, of course.

1123
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,100
我昨天在书桌下面找到的
I found it yesterday under the desk.

1124
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:11,000
这不是格丽泽尔达的
It's not Griselda's.

1125
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:13,000
这是安妮的
It's Anne's.

1126
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,200
- 我应该交给警督吗 - 不用
- Should I give it to the Inspector? - No.

1127
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:18,400
现在还不用
Not just yet.

1128
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:20,800
长官 我能跟你说几句吗
Sir, can I have a word?

1129
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:27,700
真是令人不快
How very unpleasant.

1130
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:29,600
那一节是什么
The verse?

1131
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:34,700
"但要免淫乱的事 男子当各有自己的妻子
"To avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife

1132
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:37,300
女子也当各有自己的丈夫"
"and let every woman have her own husband."

1133
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:42,400
摩托车是在当天早上被盗的
The motorbike was stolen in the morning

1134
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,300
事故之后就被丢弃了
and dumped soon after the incident.

1135
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:48,500
这谋杀手段真是太粗鲁 太难捉摸了
Such a...crude and uncertain way of killing someone,

1136
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,000
- 除非这只是用来吓唬他的 - 我 呃
- unless it was just meant to frighten him. - I, er...

1137
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:53,400
我必须继续走访了
I must get on with my visiting.

1138
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:55,900
我就不用送了
I can...see myself out.

1139
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:57,600
我们要回去找普罗瑟罗太太了
We'll get back to Mrs Protheroe.

1140
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:37,600
你好 马普尔小姐
Hello, Miss Marple.

1141
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:40,000
我在想把这幅画留下来
I was thinking about leaving this one.

1142
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:41,900
或许某天 我会回来完成它
I might come back and finish it one day.

1143
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:43,500
你什么时候走?
When do you go?

1144
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,700
还没定 明天或者后天
I don't know. Tomorrow or the next day.

1145
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:48,500
我一收拾完小屋就走了
As soon as I can clean out the cottage.

1146
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:49,900
回去伦敦吗
Back to London?

1147
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:51,600
我在考虑去爱尔兰
I was thinking about Ireland.

1148
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:53,800
让我们俩分开得彻底点
Put some real distance between us.

1149
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:56,500
你终会开始新生活的
You'll find a new life in time.

1150
01:16:57,100 --> 01:17:00,000
- 但安妮不会 对吧 - 我会尽力帮她的
- But Anne won't, will she? - I'll do my best for her.

1151
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:02,000
她是个好朋友
She's a good friend.

1152
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:04,900
谢谢你 谢谢你所做的一切
Thank you. Thank you for everything.

1153
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,300
你在哭吗
You've been crying?

1154
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:46,200
沏茶熏的 亲爱的
Pot and kettle, dear.

1155
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:49,400
我是来和你商量的
I have some things to discuss.

1156
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:57,200
用你熏香的便笺 这可不明智啊
Not very clever to use your scented notepaper.

1157
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:01,000
人们的底线都在哪了 这是我所担心的
Where are people's standards? That's what worries me.

1158
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:01,850
在梅尔切斯特
This young man

1159
01:18:01,851 --> 01:18:04,400
克莱蒙特太太被看到和一个年轻人在一起
Mrs Clement was seen with in Melchester...

1160
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:06,800
哈特内尔小姐说他非常英俊
Miss Hartnell said he was rather handsome

1161
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:08,300
还送了花给她
and he gave her flowers.

1162
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:11,400
即使是这样 我也肯定她是有合理解释的
I'm sure there's an innocent explanation, but even so,

1163
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:12,800
说真的 玛乔丽...
really, Marjorie...

1164
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:16,600
我很羞愧 简
I'm so ashamed, Jane.

1165
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:21,000
布鲁斯会怎么看我呢 还有安德鲁?
What would Bruce think of me? And Andrew?

1166
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
他们会知道你只是寂寞而已
That you sometimes get very lonely.

1167
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:29,000
- 是的 - 说起安妮・普罗瑟罗的底线
- Yes. - And Anne Protheroe's standards...

1168
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:30,900
当然 你打电话到我家里找她的时候
Of course, you weren't to know the colonel had been murdered

1169
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:33,700
并不知道上校已经被谋杀了吧
when you telephoned her at my cottage, but even so,

1170
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:36,800
但即使这样 这还是让她陷入了困境
it put her in a difficult position when she went over there.

1171
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,100
那不是我干的
That wasn't me!

1172
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:46,300
- 葬礼什么时候举行 - 周二下午
- When's the funeral? - Tuesday afternoon.

1173
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:48,600
啊 我那天一上午都在伦敦
Ah. I'm in London all morning.

1174
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,700
我希望列车会比上周二好点
I hope the trains are better than last Tuesday.

1175
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:53,990
我不得不求搭顺风车回来
I had to cadge a lift back.

1176
01:18:53,991 --> 01:18:55,300
谋杀案那天吗
The day of the murder?

1177
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:58,500
简直一团糟 一下午都没有一班
Chaos. Not a single train

1178
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:00,700
回圣玛丽・米德村的列车
to St Mary Mead the whole afternoon.

1179
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:09,000
我们每撒一个谎
Every time we tell a lie...

1180
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:12,100
都是对上帝的不敬
..we are offending God.

1181
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:19,400
"人心比万物都诡诈
"The heart is deceitful above all things,

1182
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:21,400
坏到极处
and desperately wicked.

1183
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:23,800
谁能识透呢?"
Who can know it?"

1184
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:26,700
上帝可以
Well, God can.

1185
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:31,100
他鉴察人心 识人肺腑
He sees into our hearts and searches them,

1186
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:35,000
依照各人所作所为
to give every man according to his ways

1187
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:38,700
以及他的行事后果给予奖惩
and according to the fruit of his doings.

1188
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:42,600
那么 让我们保持纯洁的心灵
Let us, then, keep our hearts pure

1189
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:45,300
待我们与使徒保罗相见时 便可说
so we may say with Paul,

1190
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:50,600
"在上帝面前 我一生心存良知"
"I have lived in all good conscience before God."

1191
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:04,800
- 噢 真不走运 - 不关运气的事
- Oh, bad luck. - It wasn't luck.

1192
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,600
有人故意刺破我的轮胎
Someone stabbed my tyre.

1193
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,300
真是粗暴至极
Such a violent thing to do.

1194
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:11,800
这些天来坏事接踵而至
With everything that's been going on, I'm...

1195
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:13,600
我真是害怕 列丁先生
I'm terrified, Mr Redding.

1196
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:15,700
如果你乐意 我就陪你走回家吧
Well, I'll walk you to your digs if you'd like.

1197
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:17,309
噢 好啊 你真愿意吗
Oh, yes, please. Would you?

1198
01:20:17,310 --> 01:20:18,300
愿上帝保佑你
Bless you.

1199
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:19,700
谢谢你
Thank you.

1200
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:30,500
什么事?
Yes?

1201
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:33,800
我想要
I want to...

1202
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,100
心存良知地活着
live in all good conscience.

1203
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:38,600
请让我向你介绍
May I introduce you

1204
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:39,900
我的母亲
to my mother

1205
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,800
我知道 我知道我不是一个好母亲的模范
I know. I know I'm not a good advertisement for motherhood.

1206
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,500
我又不需要什么模范妈妈
I don't want an advertisement.

1207
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:51,500
容我冒犯 为什么上校要和你离婚呢
Why did the colonel divorce you, may I ask?

1208
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,500
我有过那么一点点的放纵
I had a...tiny, tiny fling.

1209
01:20:55,900 --> 01:20:58,100
我乐衷于派对和社交
I like parties and people,

1210
01:20:58,100 --> 01:21:01,000
但是卢修斯想要管着我
but Lucius wanted to clip my wings.

1211
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:04,200
他答应给我零用钱 条件是
He offered me an allowance in return...

1212
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:06,000
条件是永远不再见我
In return for never seeing me again.

1213
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:07,166
直到现在
Until now.

1214
01:21:07,167 --> 01:21:09,100
我第二任丈夫去世六年之后
It's taken me six years

1215
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:11,700
我才能鼓起勇气
since my second husband died to get my courage up.

1216
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:14,400
多半不过是些酒后之勇罢了
Dutch courage, mostly.

1217
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:16,900
我并不为自己骄傲
I'm not very proud of myself.

1218
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:18,700
至少你现在在这儿 妈妈
You're here now, Mother.

1219
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:20,400
我还以为你死了呢
I thought you were dead.

1220
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,300
先别说这些无谓感伤了
Never mind the hearts and flowers.

1221
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:25,900
听我说 我们有目击证人看到
Look, when Protheroe came to your room...

1222
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:29,600
普罗瑟罗去过你的房间 当时你是否要勒索他
We have a witness. Were you trying to blackmail him?

1223
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:32,100
天啊 不 这可真是冤枉
Lord, no! I'm very well set up.

1224
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:34,142
不 我只是告诉他
No. I just told him

1225
01:21:34,143 --> 01:21:36,200
我想见我可爱的女儿莱蒂斯
I wanted to see lovely daughter Lettice.

1226
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:39,000
她会让我改过自新的
She's going to reform me.

1227
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:40,538
我现在只有你了
You're all I've got.

1228
01:21:40,539 --> 01:21:41,900
她希望我住在小屋里
She sees me in a cottage,

1229
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:44,700
有空就烘培果酱或者编织 之类的
baking jam and knitting...things.

1230
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:48,200
要是我们有空能去旅游一下就好了 亲爱的
As long as we can have an occasional cruise, dear.

1231
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:49,900
莱蒂斯
Lettice...

1232
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:52,900
我能私下和你讲几句吗
may I have a private word?

1233
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:02,800
- 这是安妮的 - 这是在你父亲被谋杀的
- It's Anne's. - It was under the desk

1234
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,500
书桌下面找到的
where your father was murdered.

1235
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:06,900
我就知道是她杀的 告诉警方吧
I knew it was her. Tell the police.

1236
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:08,600
是不是那天你假装
Did you put it there

1237
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:10,900
找贝雷帽的时候放在那里的?
when you were pretending to look for your beret?

1238
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:14,500
案发当天她并没戴着这对耳环
She wasn't wearing those earrings on the day of the murder.

1239
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:19,500
- 没有吗 - 噢 莱蒂斯这可是我啊
- Wasn't she? - Oh, Lettice, it's me.

1240
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:23,400
好吧 但是我觉得
All right, but I don't see

1241
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:24,800
这有什么大不了的 马普尔小姐
what difference it makes, Miss Marple.

1242
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:26,500
反正就是她杀的
She killed him somehow

1243
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:28,500
这样她就可以和劳伦斯在一起了
so she could get her hands on Lawrence.

1244
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:31,300
- 莱蒂斯- 怎么了
- Lettice - What?

1245
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:35,100
你裙子上的红色颜料是新弄的吧
The red paint on your dress was new, wasn't it?

1246
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:37,400
你之前就躲在那间小屋里
You'd just been in the shed.

1247
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:41,500
那又怎样 我听到你们过来了 我得躲起来啊
So? I heard you all coming and I had to hide.

1248
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:43,000
我肯定是碰到什么东西了
I must have brushed against something.

1249
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,100
但是 这叫洋红色
It was magenta, anyway.

1250
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,900
激情的颜色 劳伦斯说的
The colour of passion, Lawrence says.

1251
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:01,100
要知道 赫麦亚妮 我必须要告诉警察
You know, Hermione, I'll have to tell the police.

1252
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:03,700
谢谢你 亲爱的
Thank you, dear.

1253
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:07,200
当上校如约来到牧师寓所时
When the colonel kept his appointment at the vicarage,

1254
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:08,200
他刚好得知豪伊斯先生
he had just learnt

1255
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:10,700
是因为受到怀疑而离开上一任教区的
that Mr Hawes left his last parish under a cloud.

1256
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:13,500
主教没有告诉牧师是想再给他一次机会
The bishop kept it from the vicar to give him another chance

1257
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:16,300
- 他做了什么 - 做假帐
- What had he done? - Fiddled the accounts.

1258
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:23,200
罗尼自杀了
Ronnie's tried to kill himself.

1259
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:25,633
海多克医生正在那里
Dr Haydock's there

1260
01:23:25,634 --> 01:23:27,100
他还发现了普罗瑟罗上校
and he's found a statement

1261
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:29,200
所写的指责他的信
from Colonel Protheroe accusing him...

1262
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:32,000
- 指责他挪用捐款吗 - 是的
- Accusing him of stealing? - Yes.

1263
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:35,700
我欠你一盒巧克力
I owe you a box of chocs.

1264
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:38,400
什么都瞒不过你 对吧 马普尔小姐
Nothing gets past you, Miss Marple, does it?

1265
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:40,000
几乎没有过
Hardly ever.

1266
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:03,400
什么都瞒不过你 对吧 马普尔小姐
Nothing gets past you, Miss Marple, does it?

1267
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,400
几乎没有过 年轻人
Hardly ever, young man.

1268
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:10,200
真是狡猾
How clever!

1269
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:13,000
真是恶毒
How wicked!

1270
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:30,100
煤气开到最大档
The gas was full on,

1271
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:33,100
大量镇静剂会让他安静入眠
and that much sedative would have put him to sleep quickly.

1272
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:36,000
再迟几分钟 他就真能逃过绞刑了
Another few minutes and he would have cheated the hangman.

1273
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:39,600
"今日关于圣玛丽・米德村助理牧师
"Note of conversation today regarding Ronald Hawes

1274
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,300
罗纳德・豪伊斯先前
curate of St Mary Mead.

1275
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:44,800
挪用资金的谈话记录" 都在这里了
Previous embezzlement of funds..." It's all here.

1276
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:47,800
杜福斯先生说过他看到的便条篇幅更长
Monsieur Dufosse said the note he saw was longer.

1277
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:50,600
那套账本 他说过他留在了书房里
The accounts. He told me he'd left them in the study.

1278
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:53,200
劳伦斯・列丁或许知道他的精神状态
Lawrence Redding can tell us his state of mind.

1279
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:56,300
女房东说他们一起进来的 还聊了一下
The landlady said he came in with him and stayed talking.

1280
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:14,000
- 现在跑起来很好 对吧 - 噢
- Running well now, isn't she? - Ooh.

1281
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:18,100
我都明白了 警督
I've got it, Inspector.

1282
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:20,500
莱蒂斯说的没错
Lettice was right.

1283
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:23,400
安妮・普罗瑟罗确实杀害了她的丈夫
Anne Protheroe did kill her husband.

1284
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:25,700
安妮和劳伦斯・列丁
Anne and Lawrence Redding.

1285
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,700
他们确保使奸情曝光
They made themselves the obvious suspects

1286
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:31,800
让自己成为最明显的嫌疑人
by ensuring their secret was out,

1287
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:34,100
他们知道如果计划成功
knowing that if their plan worked

1288
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:36,300
他们之后就能摆脱嫌疑了
They would later appear above suspicion

1289
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:39,200
噢 我忘了你要过来
Oh! I forgot you were coming.

1290
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,700
当然啦 他并没有忘记
Which, of course, he had not,

1291
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:45,100
而安妮提议换个地方 改去三角帽酒馆
and Anne Protheroe chose the Toby Jug just for a change

1292
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:48,700
列丁先生并不是要撞倒上校
Mr Redding wasn't trying to run the colonel down

1293
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:51,500
他知道 当安妮在审讯时提及此事
He knew it would help them muddy the waters

1294
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:54,200
这有助他们扰乱调查方向
when Anne mentioned it at the inquest.

1295
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:57,100
- 该死的蠢蛋! - 噢
- Bloody fool! - Oh!

1296
01:25:57,100 --> 01:25:59,300
他们是要确保我会成为
They were making sure I'd be a captive audience

1297
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:02,200
他们这个把戏的忠实观众
for their little charade in a ringside seat

1298
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:07,500
那时他身上一定带着枪和消音器
He must have had his gun with him then and a silencer

1299
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:10,500
还记得杜福斯先生说到的长枪筒吗
Monsieur Dufosse, remember, spoke of a long barrel.

1300
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,700
列丁先生在书房等你
Mr Redding in the study.

1301
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:20,600
这是正确的决定
It's the right decision.

1302
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,800
- 你跟她说了吗 - 我还没想到怎么说
- Have you told her? - I need to find the words.

1303
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,400
之后 他打了两个电话
Then, he made two telephone calls,

1304
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:27,300
第一个假装艾博特先生的邻居
the first to get the vicar out of the way

1305
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:29,300
让牧师离开寓所
by pretending to be Mr Abbot's neighbour

1306
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:32,100
玛丽 低地农场的老艾博特先生
Mary, old Mr Abbot at Lower Farm

1307
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:34,400
他邻居来电说他又病重垂危了
his neighbour's telephoned to say he's very poorly again.

1308
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:37,000
第二个打到我的家里
The second to my cottage.

1309
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,600
圣玛丽・米德村235号
St Mary Mead 235.

1310
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:39,900
一切就绪 亲爱的
We're all set, darling.

1311
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:45,400
那是找我的 失陪了
It was for me. Sorry.

1312
01:26:47,300 --> 01:26:50,300
她知道我会证明她身上不可能有枪
She knew I'd see she couldn't possibly have a gun with her

1313
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:53,000
在6点20分 她去了牧师寓所
when she went into the vicarage at 20 past six

1314
01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:15,100
就在那个时候 你射杀了你的丈夫
Which was when you shot your husband.

1315
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:21,400
你电话里还说是让我来品尝咖啡蛋糕呢
"Coffee and cake," you said, when you telephoned.

1316
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:24,600
劳伦斯在哪里
Where's Lawrence.

1317
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:26,800
现在已经被逮捕了
Under arrest by now.

1318
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:30,600
玛丽在6点20分听到的响嚏
The loud sneeze that Mary heard at 6:20

1319
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:32,000
是你的消音手枪发出的
was your silenced pistol

1320
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,300
而开枪的人是普罗瑟罗太太 列丁先生
Mr Redding, fired by Mrs Protheroe.

1321
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:36,800
6点30分的枪声一直让我迷惑
The shot at 6:30 had me puzzled,

1322
01:27:37,100 --> 01:27:40,000
直到马普尔小姐发现了她的所为
until Miss Marple found what she did.

1323
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:42,900
枪声不是从树林或寓所传来的
It didn't come from the woods or from the house

1324
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:44,200
而是你的木屋里
It came from the shed.

1325
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:47,900
于是她和杜福斯家的人一起离开
So she goes off with the Dufosses

1326
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:49,400
而你去了蓝野猪旅馆
and you go to the Blue Boar

1327
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,900
要大杯的 我今天过得糟透了
A large one. I've had a hell of a day.

1328
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:54,400
之后你返回牧师寓所
Then you return to the vicarage

1329
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,700
借口说要再见一次克莱蒙特先生
on the pretext of seeing Mr Clement again

1330
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:59,900
而你明知他正在瞎忙活 根本还没回来
knowing he wouldn't be back from his wild-goose chase.

1331
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:01,500
跟上校一起在书房等吧
Wait in the study with the colonel.

1332
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:02,900
- 他也在吗 - 是的
- He's here? - He is.

1333
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:11,800
你带走了凶器
You remove the murder weapon

1334
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:15,200
还留下了一张故意留下破绽的假便条
and leave a forged note with deliberate mistakes.

1335
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:18,400
纸条是你之前从牧师寓所里拿的
Different handwriting in different inks

1336
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:21,600
用不同的墨水和笔迹来写
on vicarage notepaper you'd taken previously.

1337
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:25,100
出乎意料地看到了上校写的陈述信
A shock to find a statement from the colonel

1338
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:27,100
但这日后或许能派上用场
but it might come in useful

1339
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:34,000
你知道钟是调快的 你重调了时间
You reset the clock knowing it was fast

1340
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:38,400
这一切都是为了让我们相信
all to make us think Mrs Protheroe

1341
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,200
普罗瑟罗太太与他丈夫的死
was being falsely implicated

1342
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:41,800
毫无牵连
in her husband's murder

1343
01:28:42,700 --> 01:28:44,200
而上校的陈述信在昨晚
And the colonel's statement did

1344
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:47,000
也的确派上用场了 对吧
come in useful last night, didn't it?

1345
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,200
这样你就有充分的动机证据去
As you now had evidence of a motive,

1346
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:53,100
陷害豪伊斯先生谋杀罪名了
enough to frame Mr Hawes for the murder.

1347
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:55,400
噢 真不走运
Oh, bad luck.

1348
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:58,300
"冷静 罗尼 我来帮你调药"
"Calm down, Ronnie. I'll mix your medicine"

1349
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:01,700
之后你打开煤气就离开了
and turn on the gas as you drift away

1350
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,900
还把上校的信留在他身边
and leave the colonel's note by the body.

1351
01:29:07,700 --> 01:29:09,300
这可是谋杀啊 安妮
But murder, Anne?

1352
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:13,300
就是为了一个提醒你过去的陌生人吗
For a stranger who reminded you of what might have been?

1353
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:16,700
他不是陌生人
He wasn't a stranger.

1354
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:22,000
但我也没说错
But I was right when I said

1355
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,600
我说过一切从此都改变了
that nothing was ever the same again

1356
01:29:26,900 --> 01:29:29,500
劳伦斯就是那个没能从战场上回来的人
It was Lawrence who didn't come back from the fighting...

1357
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:31,200
但他最后还是回来了
except that he did

1358
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:34,800
在他被公告战亡的四年之后
four years after he'd been reported dead,

1359
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,900
而那时候 我已经是普罗瑟罗太太了
and by then, I was Mrs Protheroe.

1360
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:40,000
是他找的你吗
He found you?

1361
01:29:40,700 --> 01:29:43,900
当他得知我结婚后 就打消了这个念头
He was too decent to try when he heard I'd married.

1362
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:45,500
是我找的他
I found him.

1363
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:47,200
一篇杂志文章写的关于
A magazine article

1364
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:50,000
一位死里逃生的新晋年轻艺术家
about the rising young artist back from the dead.

1365
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:55,500
我们做错了什么
What did we do wrong?

1366
01:29:57,400 --> 01:29:59,400
你居然问我这个?
You ask me that?

1367
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:02,600
我们哪里露出了破绽?
What mistake did we make?

1368
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:05,300
当你和他从木屋里出来
When you came out of the shed with him

1369
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:06,700
你还是和以往一样
you were the same woman.

1370
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:10,700
你没有对你所爱的人道句永别
You hadn't said goodbye forever to the man you loved.

1371
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:14,028
这你都能看得出来吗
You could tell that?

1372
01:30:14,029 --> 01:30:15,400
你以为我没试过
You think I've never...

1373
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:19,300
我也在战争中失去了所爱
I lost someone in the war...

1374
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:22,000
他因战亡得到了勋章
..who got a medal for dying.

1375
01:30:23,900 --> 01:30:26,200
由他的妻子好好珍藏着
His wife will have cherished it.

1376
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:30,000
他的妻子?
His wife?

1377
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:37,500
那这对你就轻松多了 简
Easier for you, then, Jane.

1378
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,200
他死了
He was dead.

1379
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:44,200
你就不用在对错之间做选择
You didn't have to choose between right and wrong.

1380
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:48,900
亲爱的 当你志愿当兵时
When you volunteered, darling

1381
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:50,500
你选择了去尽你的义务
you made a choice to do your duty.

1382
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:53,500
- 是的 - 我也要做出我的选择了
- Yes. - I've had to make a choice too.

1383
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:55,800
而我也选择去尽我的义务
I've chosen to do my duty.

1384
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,700
平安回来 但是为了你的妻子 不是为了我
Come back safe, but for your wife, not for me.

1385
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:00,900
简
Jane...

1386
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:04,900
别这样 如果我不是为了你回来 那就
Please, if I can't come back for you, then there's...

1387
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:09,800
简!
Jane!

1388
01:31:10,900 --> 01:31:12,300
简!
Jane!

1389
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:42,200
劳伦斯!劳伦斯!
Lawrence! Lawrence!

1390
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:18,100
你吃炖鱼配上杏子酸辣酱时 我就怀疑了
It's the apricot chutney with fish stew that gave me inkling

1391
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:20,500
你什么时候发现的
When did you find out?

1392
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:22,900
我表哥今早打电话过来确认的
My cousin called this morning to confirm it.

1393
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:23,900
难怪了
Of course!

1394
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,900
他就是梅尔切斯特的那个医生 对吧
He's that doctor in Melchester, isn't he?

1395
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:27,600
那个很英俊的年轻人
Rather a handsome young man.

1396
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:29,800
我不想去海多克医生那里看
I didn't want to see Dr Haydock.

1397
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:31,500
哎 你也知道村里的八卦啦
Well, you know village gossip.

1398
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:34,200
我也想先确认了再说
And I wanted to be sure first.

1399
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:36,300
她跟我说她是去的伦敦
She told me she'd gone to London.

1400
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:38,700
我从没怀疑过一丁点
I never suspected a thing.

1401
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:07,300
我们在天上的父
Our Father who art in heaven,

1402
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:09,000
愿人都尊你的名为圣
hallowed be thy name.

1403
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:11,100
愿你的国降临
Thy kingdom come.

1404
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:13,500
愿您的旨意行在地上 如同行在天上
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

1405
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:17,500
我们日用的饮食 今日赐给我们 免我们的债
Give us this day our daily bread. Forgive us our trespasses.

1406
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:21,300
如同我们免了人的债
As we forgive those who trespass against us.

1407
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:23,200
不叫我们遇见试探
And lead us not into temptation.

1408
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:25,600
救我们脱离凶恶
But deliver us from evil.
