00:00:08,243 --> 00:00:09,411
Are you ready, kids?

3
00:00:09,444 --> 00:00:11,346
Aye, aye, Captain!

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,547
I can't hear you.

5
00:00:12,581 --> 00:00:14,549
Aye, aye, Captain!

6
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:17,552
* ooh!

7
00:00:17,586 --> 00:00:19,721

19
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:09,302
Good morning, bikini bottom.

20
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:13,206
Ah, what a beautiful day.

21
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,075
* doo-Doo-Doo-Doo, doo-Doo-Doo

22
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:16,877
I wonder if Patrick's at home.

23
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,145
Hiya, Spongebob.

24
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:19,713
What are you doing?

25
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,715
Going over to
Sandy's place.

26
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:22,983
Hey, what's this?

27
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:24,985
This doesn't look
like Sandy's place.

28
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:27,755
Don't lose your
barnacles, boys.

29
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:29,923
There it is.

30
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:31,024
What is it?

31
00:01:31,058 --> 00:01:32,159
Can't you see?

32
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:33,160
It's texas.

33
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:34,662
"Texas"?

34
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:38,098
What's a texas?

35
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:41,368
Oh, it's nothing
but a memory now.

36
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:42,670
All right, then.

37
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:44,337
Uh, let's make one
of your tree dome.

38
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:45,773
Y-You know,
all of a sudden

39
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:48,008
I don't feel much like
sandcastles, Spongebob.

40
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,076
I'll see y'all later.

41
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,744
Hmm?

42
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:51,912
Sandy...

43
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:56,750
Aw, Spongebob

44
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:59,219
I'm just not feeling
up to karate right now.

45
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,288
I get it.

46
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:04,324
"Not feeling up to karate," huh?

47
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:06,694
Whatever you say, Sandy.

48
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:09,396
Boy, i hope
Sandy doesn't attack me

49
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,931
From behind.

50
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:20,040
Uh... Sandy?

51
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:22,275
Surf's up, Sandy.

52
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,277
No thanks.

53
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:30,450
Boy, there's nothing
like going jellyfishing.

54
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,821
Whoa!

55
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,058
Look, Sandy,
we caught one!

56
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:39,927
Listen, Spongebob

57
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,095
Right now, i don't want
to build sandcastles

58
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:43,931
Play karate or eat jellyfish.

59
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,700
We don't eat 'em!

60
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:47,835
We let 'em go!

61
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:49,837
Fly away,
little critter!

62
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,472
Go on, go back home
where you belong.

63
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,908
Run along, back to your family
and friends.

64
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:55,976
I know they miss you

65
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,277
As much as you miss them.

66
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,813
Hurry, before they forget you
and leave you behind!

67
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:00,914
Remember--

68
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:03,150
* there's no place
like home *

69
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:18,298
Sandy, what the heck
are you crying about?

70
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:21,735
I ain't cryin',
my helmet just sprung a leak.

71
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:23,370
Sandy...

72
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:26,740
Oh, i guess i'm just feeling
a little homesick.

73
00:03:26,774 --> 00:03:29,142
Homesick, huh?

74
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:31,144
Mm-Mmm.

75
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:32,813
Almost there!

76
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:35,215
Dad-Gum it, Spongebob,
what is it?

77
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:36,784
* da, ta-Da!

78
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:40,754
Welcome home, Sandy!

79
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:46,493
Sandy?

80
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,095
Go away.

81
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,232
I don't get it, Patrick.

82
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:54,067
What's wrong with Sandy?

83
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:56,904
Maybe it's just
a squirrel thing.

84
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:08,181
* wish i was back in texas

85
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:12,886
* the ocean's no place
for a squirrel *

86
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:17,557
* wish i was in texas

87
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,928
* prettiest place

88
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:23,030
* oh, no

89
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:25,098
* i guess a-Deep in my heart

90
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:28,802

91
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:34,942

00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:37,077

00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:45,953
Hey, Patrick--

94
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:48,021
Get 'em off me!
Get 'em off me!

95
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:48,689
Patrick!

96
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:50,391
Listen...

97
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:52,393
It's Sandy.

98
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:56,764
* i want to wake up in texas

99
00:04:56,797 --> 00:05:00,668

00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:05,406

101
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:09,477

102
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,011
* oh, why

103
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,581
* when i'm so far from you,

104
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:17,851

106
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:45,613
* i want to go ho-Ome.

107
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:53,521
Do you think she knows
the muffin man song?

108
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:56,790
Patrick, she sang that
song from her heart!

109
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:58,992
She really misses texas.

110
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:02,430
Well, let's go get some texas
and bring it down here.

111
00:06:02,463 --> 00:06:04,432
Patrick,
you can't...

112
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:05,899
That's it!

113
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:07,901
Patrick, your
genius is showing.

114
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:09,870
Where?!

115
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:12,139
Everything
looks perfect.

116
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:13,907
We're going to go
get Sandy now.

117
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:15,676
Well, hurry it up, lads!

118
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,010
Can't squat like this forever!

119
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:19,913
Krusty krab! Krusty krab!

120
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:22,516
Sandy's surprise
is at the krusty krab!

121
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,117
Wait'll she sees the...

122
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:25,185
Shh!

123
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,720
Don't spoil
the surprise.

124
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:30,724
Hey, Sandy!
Hey, Sandy!

125
00:06:30,758 --> 00:06:32,059
You want to
come with us

126
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:33,694
To the krusty krab?

127
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,429
Hey, Spongebob.

128
00:06:35,463 --> 00:06:36,964
Hey, Patrick.

129
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:38,866
What are you doing
with those bags?

130
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,001
I'm goin' back home to texas.

131
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:42,135
What?! Now?!

132
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:44,472
You can't! I mean, we...

133
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:47,007
It's time for
this tumbleweed
to tumble on home.

134
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,476
W-Wait, Sandy.

135
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:50,711
You can't, uh...
'cause we were gonna...

136
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,046
At the krusty krab
is... that is not
the right direction...

137
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,048
Wait! If you don't...
if i can't...

138
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:58,051
Sandy, wait a second!

139
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,720
You don't want to
leave without having

140
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,722
One last coddy-Batty
down at the krusty krab!

141
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,691
I'm tired of fish
food, Spongebob.

142
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:06,126
B-But Sandy,
don't you want
to say good-Bye

143
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,629
To all your friends
down at the krusty krab?

144
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:10,464
I just can't do
that, Spongebob.

145
00:07:10,498 --> 00:07:12,500
It'd be too sad.

146
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:16,504
N-No, no, wait!

147
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:17,771
Sandy!

148
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,810
I can't believe
she's gone.

149
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:26,647
Yeah. What's so great
about dumb, old texas?

150
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:30,250
What did you say?

151
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,119
Texas is dumb?

152
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:36,524
Don't you dare
take the name of texas in vain!

153
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:39,527
You mean we can't
say anything bad
about dumb, old texas?

154
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,861
No, you can't!

155
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:45,098
Oh, then, can we
say people from
texas are dumb?

156
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:48,869
No! You can't say nothin'
about texas!

157
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:51,972
Oh!

158
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:56,777
So we shouldn't say anything bad
about tex-As!

159
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,813
I'm warning you, Spongebob!

160
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:01,915
Look, Patrick--
I'm texas!

161
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,884
Duh, howdy, y'all!

162
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,753
I'm texas, too.

163
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:07,655
Get a dog, little longie.

164
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,289
Howdy, y'all!

165
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,091
Howdy, y'all!

166
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:12,893
Get a dog,
little longie!

167
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:14,161
Get a dog...

168
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:16,029
Y'all best cut it out!

169
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:19,066
* the stars at night
are dull and dim *

170
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:21,569
* whenever
they have to be *

171
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:23,937
* over dumb, old,
stupid texas! *

172
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:25,806
Hey, Patrick, what am i now?

173
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,575
Uh... stupid?

174
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:29,777
No, i'm texas!

175
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,645
What's the difference!

176
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,584
You all best apologize

177
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:38,852
Or i'm going to be on you
like ugly on an ape!

178
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:40,621
You'll have
to catch us first!

179
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,593
We did it.
We got her.

180
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:47,995
Krusty krab,
here we come!

181
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:53,734
Can we say that plants
from texas are dumb?

182
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:59,707
Can we say that shoes
from texas are dumb?

183
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,942
Uh, okay, Patrick,
that's enough.

184
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:06,914
Why? Do you think
that old slowpoke,
texas, is gonna...

185
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,922
Run faster,
Patrick!

186
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:31,772
Spongebob!

187
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:46,687
You're going
to take back what you said!

188
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:49,723
No!

189
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:51,792
Almost there.

190
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:09,743
Spongebob!

191
00:10:09,777 --> 00:10:11,344
You been messin' with the bull!

192
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:14,682
Now here come the horns!

193
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:16,349
No, Sandy!

194
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,252
No!

195
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,789
Howdy, ya'll!

196
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:24,658
Wha... what's this?

197
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:26,326
It's a party.

198
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:27,961
For you!

199
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:29,663
For me?!

200
00:10:29,697 --> 00:10:31,699
It's your own little
slice of texas.

201
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:32,866
Check it out, Sandy.

202
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,702
We got square dancin'...

203
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:36,069
Giant barby-Q's...

204
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:37,738
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

205
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:40,407
Homemade peas-
In-A-Can pies

206
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,977
And we got our very own
ten-Gallon hats.

207
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:47,147
So, what do you think?
You gonna stay?

208
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:01,228
Don't cry anymore,
Sandy.

209
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:03,130
I'll go get
your bags.

210
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:14,041
I'm not cryin'.
I'm laughin'.

211
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:16,844
I appreciate what
y'all are trying
to do, Spongebob

212
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:19,713
But home isn't about
barbecues and pecan pies.

213
00:11:19,747 --> 00:11:21,348
Home is where
you're surrounded

214
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:23,450
By other critters
that care about you.

215
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,354
Huh?

216
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:29,122
Duh, what am i doin'?

217
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:30,891
I been home all along

218
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:33,761
And i took me till
just now to realize it.

219
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:35,128
Does that mean
you'll stay?

220
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:37,064
I'm stayin'!

221
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:41,301
Whoo-Hoo!
She's stayin'!

222
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,203
Whoo! That makes me feel
all wiggly!

223
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:48,008
Yeah, who needs
dumb, old texas?

224
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,943
What did you just say?

225
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:52,245
Should i start running now?

226
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:19,940
Attention, beachgoers!

227
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:22,242
You are trespassing!

228
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,311
You have exactly 17 minutes

229
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:28,115
To haul your carcasses
off of the future site...

230
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:30,517
Of the chum bucket mega bucket.

231
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,853
Do you hear
something?

232
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:39,927
Okay, have it your way!

233
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,829
I don't mind bulldozing

234
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:43,530
Over each
and every one...

235
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:45,065
Mommy, look.

236
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,167
Somebody left
this toy tractor here.

237
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,168
Put that down,
billy.

238
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:49,202
That has germs
on it.

239
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:50,237
Oh...

240
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:52,439
Aw, mom...

241
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:55,542
You'll see!

242
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:58,078
You'll all see!

243
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:01,348
The future site
of the chum bucket mega bucket

244
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:02,850
Must be cleared

245
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:05,185
Of these cretinous beachgoers

246
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:09,056
But it's becoming
increasingly obvious!

247
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:11,591
I can deny it no longer!

248
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,361
I am small.

249
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:16,363
I need someone big

250
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:19,299
To clear the beach for me.

251
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:20,467
I need...

252
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:24,004
Spongebob.

253
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:25,973
* steppin' on the beach,
roo-To to-Too *

254
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:27,975
* steppin' on the beach,
roo-To to-Too *

255
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:29,977
* steppin' on the beach,
roo-To to-Too *

256
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,945
* steppin' on the beach,
roo-To to-Too *

257
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:35,315
Yes. He's the one.

258
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:39,920
I'll have one...

259
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:41,121
Two please.

260
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,923
Thanks.

261
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:44,291
One, please.

262
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:46,426
Excuse me.

263
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:51,131
One, please.

264
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,466
Sorry, kid,
we're all out.

265
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,468
Aw, barnacles.

266
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,475
Plankton, what are
you doing here?

267
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,444
And why are you crying?

268
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:06,246
Oh, hi, Spongebob.

269
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:14,521
I'm crying because i've
got these two ice cream cones

270
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:16,890
But i only need one.

271
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:21,028
I don't know what to do
with the other one.

272
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:31,204
I'll eat one of those
ice cream cones for you.

273
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:35,142
Spongebob,
would you do that for me?

274
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:36,409
Sure.

275
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:40,880
Spongebob.

276
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,650
Spongebob.

277
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:49,489
Spongebob!

278
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:50,223
Yeah?

279
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:51,324
Isn't it great

280
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:54,194
To get the things you desire?

281
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:58,198
Like that ice cream cone,
for instance.

282
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:02,135
You can have anything you want
with a little training.

283
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:03,670
Training?

284
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:06,139
Yes. You just have to learn

285
00:15:06,173 --> 00:15:09,509
To be more assertive,
and i can show you how.

286
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:12,980
Assertive, huh?

287
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:14,381
That's right.

288
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:17,584
Anything i want?

289
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,523
Sounds great!

290
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:24,958
Wonderful.

291
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,373
Spongebob.

292
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:43,276
Don't let that guy sit on you.

293
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:46,179
Assertiveness lesson number one.

294
00:15:46,213 --> 00:15:48,048
Tell him to get off.

295
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:49,983
Um... excuse me, sir.

296
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:52,119
Y-You're sitting
on my body

297
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:53,753
Which is also my face.

298
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,056
No, no, be assertive.

299
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:57,390
Beep-Beep.

300
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:00,527
Not insertive.

301
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,298
Spongebob, you
missed your chance.

302
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:09,069
You've got to be aggressive
to get the things you want.

303
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:10,003
You're too soft.

304
00:16:10,037 --> 00:16:11,204
But i'm a spong...

305
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:12,372
Don't say it.

306
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:17,477
There's the guy who
took your ice cream.

307
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,146
Don't you want it back?

308
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:20,347
Ice cream.

309
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,548
Listen, you.

310
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:24,517
My friend's got
something to say.

311
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:26,153
What? Who said that?

312
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:27,520
Was it you?

313
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:29,522
Tell him off, Spongebob.

314
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:31,058
Assert yourself.

315
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:32,725
That's my ice cream cone.

316
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:34,161
Great!

317
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:35,328
Now let him have it!

318
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:37,164
You can have it.

319
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:38,531
Say, thanks.

320
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:40,267
No!

321
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,769
I'll show you how.

322
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:44,504
Hey, pencil-Neck!

323
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:46,639
Yeah, you!

324
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,375
Slither over here!

325
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:51,244
Surrender that ice cream cone

326
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:54,581
Or every waking moment
for you will become

327
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:58,118
A swirling torrent
of pain and misery!

328
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:03,656
Hey, that guy was crying.

329
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,558
Those were
tears of joy.

330
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:08,495
He was happy
that you were assertive.

331
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,330
Yeah!

332
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:13,066
You see how wonderful
life can be

333
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,534
When you're maniacal?

334
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,803
Uh, i thought
it was called assertive.

335
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:18,171
Whatever.

336
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:20,373
Well, if it got me
this ice cream

337
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:21,608
Then i like it.

338
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,347
I found something.

339
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,750
Uh, excuse me, my
metal detector broke.

340
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,219
Can i use yours?

341
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:33,553
Sure.

342
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:35,088
Spongebob.

343
00:17:35,122 --> 00:17:36,423
This is your
next lesson.

344
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:37,757
Be aggressive.

345
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,626
Tell that guy to take a hike.

346
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:41,828
Do you want to take
a hike with me?

347
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:43,163
Yeah.

348
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:45,698
Now look what
you've done!

349
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,800
Tell that guy to go
fall in a ditch.

350
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:50,770
Hey, go check
in that ditch.

351
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:54,174
Wow. Buried treasure.

352
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:55,508
Thanks.

353
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:57,277
Did you see that, plankton?

354
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,146
That guy found
some buried treasure.

355
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:01,481
Spongebob, you'll
never get it right.

356
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:04,617
Tell that guy you know karate
and you'll tie him in a knot

357
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:07,220
If you don't get
your metal detector back.

358
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:10,123
Hey! I'm going to
tie your... shoe

359
00:18:10,157 --> 00:18:12,659
If you don't
give that back!

360
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:14,861
But i'm wearing
sandals!

361
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:16,363
Okay! Never mind!

362
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:19,199
It's all right, plankton.
He's wearing sandals.

363
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:20,300
What's the matter?

364
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:23,470
Oh, nothing, Spongebob.

365
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:24,471
Mama!

366
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:26,139
I was just beginning to think

367
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:27,507
That this is a waste of time.

368
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,541
No, it's not.

369
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:30,310
Forget it.

370
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:33,913
I guess you don't have what it
takes to be a standup guy.

371
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,149
Well, what
about airline food?

372
00:18:36,183 --> 00:18:37,184
What?

373
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:38,451
Airline food!

374
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:40,353
My gosh, what is up
with that stuff?

375
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:41,554
Thank you. Good night.

376
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:44,657
See, i can be
a standup guy. See?

377
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:47,760
Spongebob, you'll never
get what you want.

378
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:50,730
You always let people
step all over you.

379
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,565
You're just like stairs.

380
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:55,235
Wait, plankton,
give me another chance.

381
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:57,637
Okay, but this is
your last chance.

382
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,572
Look at all
those beach hogs

383
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:02,309
Soaking up
your sun rays.

384
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:05,245
Do you have what it
takes to get a tan?

385
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:06,579
Just watch me!

386
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:16,689
Man, this thing is san... dy!

387
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:26,533
Yes, my plan
is beginning to work.

388
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:29,202
They're leaving the beach.

389
00:19:29,236 --> 00:19:31,538
Spongebob, that
was wonderful.

390
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:33,673
Is that an all-Over tan?

391
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:34,941
Well, not all of me.

392
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:36,443
Hot dogs!

393
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:38,278
Hot dogs!

394
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:39,879
Look at that
huge line

395
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,448
At the hot
dog stand.

396
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:43,616
Assert yourself
to the front.

397
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,918
I'll do better
than that.

398
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,659
Let's go home.

399
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:55,228
Spongebob, that
was genius.

400
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:57,597
Look at all
those kite-Flyers

401
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,898
Blocking your view.

402
00:19:58,931 --> 00:19:59,899
What?!

403
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,401
Breaking
your wind.

404
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:09,409
A-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha!

405
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:13,513
Hey, Spongebob,
throw us the ball.

406
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:23,256
What do we
do now?

407
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,858
Let's just go home,
i guess.

408
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:30,263
Ha! Plankton, did you see that?

409
00:20:30,297 --> 00:20:32,399
I was a regular alpha male.

410
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:35,668
Plankton?

411
00:20:37,003 --> 00:20:38,538
Huh?

412
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:44,944
Plankton, all my asserting
has driven everybody away.

413
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,446
Exactly.

414
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:48,481
You didn't tell me
everyone would leave.

415
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:49,849
Oops.

416
00:20:52,018 --> 00:20:53,520
Mega bucket!

417
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:57,657
You used me
for land development.

418
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,992
That wasn't nice.

419
00:21:00,026 --> 00:21:03,530
Haven't you figured
it out, Spongebob?

420
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:05,398
Nice guys finish last.

421
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:08,735
Only aggressive people
conquer the world.

422
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,438
Well...

423
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:15,508
What about aggressively
nice people?

424
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:16,443
Huh?

425
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:20,613
What are
you doing?

426
00:21:23,683 --> 00:21:26,686
Hot dogs! Yay!

427
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:34,894
Wait. Spongebob, stop!

428
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,738
Butterfly kisses.

429
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:47,940
I... can't take it.

430
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,576
It's too cute.

431
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:51,978
It's, it's disgusting!

432
00:21:54,447 --> 00:21:55,915
What happened?

433
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:59,886
I hit a reef
with my new board, dude.

434
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,087
No problem.

435
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,423
Whoa!

436
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:04,957
Color!

437
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:08,628
Spongebob, stop--
Before it's too late.

438
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:11,964
Your kindness
is bringing everybody back.

439
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:14,867
Get back!

440
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:16,703
Wait!

441
00:22:16,736 --> 00:22:19,506
Ooh! Ouch! Ow! Ow!

442
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:22,375
No! Ooh! Ow!

443
00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:25,745
Cowabunga!

444
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:30,617
Thanks, dude.

445
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:33,520
That was awesome.

446
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:36,989
Gee, plankton.

447
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:38,725
I'm sorry about
the chum bucket.

448
00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:40,660
Forget about that.

449
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:46,132
I just can't take so much
kindness at one sitting.

450
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:48,935
Need... hatred.

451
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:51,804
Volleyball, anyone?

452
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:53,072
Yeah!

453
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,408
Service!

454
00:22:56,443 --> 00:22:57,544
Ouch.

455
00:22:58,511 --> 00:22:59,679
Ouch.

456
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,918
