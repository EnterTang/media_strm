1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:04,030
OKAY????

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:05,780
????

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:09,240
The Fades are walking the earth, they can't touch, they're angry,

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,360
They're eating flesh to fight back - flesh allows them to touch.

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,230
I know - so far, so Pac-Man.

6
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,550
Then there's guys with superpowers - Angelics.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,600
They're thinking they need to stop these dead people.

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,470
Particularly Neil and his friend, Helen,

9
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,350
who is a dead sort of Fade-like ghost too, but she's on our side. Rrrrey!

10
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,460
Anyway, Paul, my best friend, has found that he's an Angelic.

11
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,540
He has violent dreams and is surprisingly powerful for one so small-shouldered.

12
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:40,710
Oh, and Paul has been getting it on with a girl, which is extraordinary in and of itself.

13
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,620
But you probably have to know him to understand that.

14
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,380
Now, who's nicked my Twilight box set?!

15
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,700
Nanu-nanu!

16

19
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,610
One, two, three...

20
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,230
You lose.

21
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,700
That's my last sock.

22
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,100
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

23
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,730
One, two, three...

24
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,670
Are we still playing? 

25
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,060
Yeah.

26
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,080
You need to say, "One, two, three," then.

27
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,990
I was... getting round to that.

28
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,520
Don't stare. It's rude.

29
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,930
And, you know... perverted.

30
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,510
Yeah.

31
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,510
One, two, three...

32
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,580
You're really good at this.

33
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,600
Put some practice in.

34
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,080
No more scissors, paper, stone, OK?

35
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,280
OK.

36
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,520
No more paper, scissors, stone.

37
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,890
You can just...

38
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,960
tell me what you want me to take off next.

39
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,260
Or... I can guess.

40
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,320
Do you want me to guess?

41
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,690
You should probably...

42
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,370
guess.

43
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,120
Oh, shit!

44
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,730
OK, then.

45
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,330
It's worse than I thought.

46
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,510
Yeah.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,420
Where's my phone?

48
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:32,960
Calling him again?

49
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,680
He's not been answering.

50
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:41,550
Paul promised me, if I stopped following him,

51
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,850
he'd stay in touch.

52
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,450
Kids get busy. Yeah, well, this kid shouldn't.

53
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,040
This kid's important.

54
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,050
So you keep saying.

55
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,110
We could take that to a hospital, you know.

56
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,490
I've never needed to go to a hospital before.

57
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,330
You've always had me before.

58
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,560
In a few days' time, I'm going to ascend, Neil, and I want you...

59
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,590
I need you to be ready for what's ahead.

60
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,330
I'm ready. You've got to be strong.

61
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,470
I know. You can't do it alone. I know.

62
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,700
So, call them.

63
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,850
The other Angelics. I will call 'em.

64
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,060
I don't want to,

65
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,150
but I will.

66
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,880
Besides...

67
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,410
I think they'd be fascinated to meet the kid.

68
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,250
I know I am.

69
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,890
Sorry. Why?

70
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,590
No, er, not sorry. Um... Thanks.

71
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,570
You're not spectacularly late. Yeah.

72
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,330
Sorry was the wrong word. Um...

73
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,450
I can't stay. I just... I wanted to say thanks.

74
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,680
Thanks for what?

75
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,050
For... for, er...

76
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,470
No, this was much easier in my head. Um...

77
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,500
I'm cured. I-I wanted to say thanks for curing me.

78
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,240
OK, that's interesting. Yeah.

79
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,800
Cured of what? Well...

80
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,240
Whatever. Does it matter?

81
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,730
I'm done. I'm... I'm too busy for this.

82
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:21,810
I've got two lives to lead, so I'm thanking you for your time.

83
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,440
OK, I understand now.

84
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,180
You're cured.

85
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,600
Call it... what you want. I'm...

86
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,850
I don't... I don't need you any more.

87
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,850
Right, course you don't.

88
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,650
Yeah, well, I need to go cos I've got someone to meet.

89
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,350
Yeah. Good luck, Paul.

90
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,050
Good... luck?

91
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,320
Yes. Good luck.

92
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,290
Yeah.

93
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,890
You're late.

94
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,550
I know. What kept you?

95
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,040
Therapy.

96
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,580
I was... with my therapist.

97
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,350
My ex-therapist.

98
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,320
Anything to be frightened of?

99
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:28,560
I... grow wings when I ejaculate.

100
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,160
You know, that's quite a good line for you.

101
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:57,260
'Have you seen what they're saying?' Yes, sir. BLOOD ON POLICE HANDS

102
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,730
Yeah, I'm looking at it now, sir. Post?

103
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:03,090
'They're blaming us for this, you know?' Yeah, I don't think we're culpable.

104
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,010
No, we can only investigate when...

105
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,610
Since when have you been interested in post?

106
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,240
Mum's not answering my calls. So?

107
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,310
'Get the statement. You need to stamp on these questions now.'

108
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,410
Nothing else? Is this everything?

109
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:17,400
If you let me speak, sir... 'Get out there, in the public eye.'

110
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,660
'Stop pottering about...' Yeah, if you let me sp...

111
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,940
'Questions have started to be asked...'

112
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,310
Any investigation in the way I've handled this case will...

113
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,080
No, I do fully understand...

114
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,060
Yes...

115
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:38,080
'Hi, it's Paul. Leave a message.'

116
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,680
Hi, it's me.

117
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,950
Er, jus-s-s-st...

118
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,150
Nothing important. It'd be good to see you, Paul.

119
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,820
Er, bye.

120
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,860
Happy birthday to me

121
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,090
Happy birth...

122
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,080
Right, just... 

123
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,850
Detective Chief Inspector...

124
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,520
Now you're following me to my house? If you'll just listen...

125
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,650
Don't come to my house. Just listen. Never come to my house.

126
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:15,260
Neil Valentine. You have to look into Neil Valentine. Look at this photo.

127
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,600
He was sleeping with my wife, I was sure of that,

128
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,980
but I didn't know how long he'd known her for.

129
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,380
Listen!

130
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,890
This mental hospital, it's key to the whole thing.

131
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,350
He probably had something to do with the boys too.

132
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,010
I've seen him with one of my students, and the missing vicar, Helen,

133
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:32,860
she was my wife's best friend so he knew her as well, so...

134
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,140
Listen to me!

135
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:43,330
Desperate men do desperate things, so I'll forgive you this one.

136
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,730
You need to take your hands off me. Right now.

137
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,510
Thank you.

138
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,480
You're his son?

139
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,230
Never was good at making parents' evening, my dad.

140
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,240
He needs to listen to me.

141
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,960
Join the club. He needs to listen to me too.

142
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,550
Paul.

143
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:22,440
If you're never going to answer your phone, then you can, um...

144
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,790
Just answer your phone, will you?

145
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,720
I thought you hated this place.

146
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,570
I know this place. Nowhere's safe any more.

147
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,450
Better to be a place that you know.

148
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,730
We'll search it... properly. Make it ours.

149
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,360
I should be a dead man, Helen. They were all over me.

150
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,240
Like flies around shit.

151
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:58,520
So we don't know what he is, we don't know where he is,

152
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,590
we don't know what his plans are.

153
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,750
Apart from killing our people.

154
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,230
Yeah.

155
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,410
Helen...

156
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,160
there's someone here.

157
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,540
You reconsidered? You're here to help?

158
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,700
No.

159
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,000
So, it's Mark again?

160
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,970
He used to be your friend. He still is my friend.

161
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,120
I used to be someone you cared about.

162
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,520
You still are someone I care about.

163
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:27,820
Just tell him that I'm here and that I love him.

164
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,060
That's not too much to ask.

165
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,970
How do you think that's going to make his life better in any way?

166
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,520
Never did understand love, did you?

167
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,520
It's interesting she can still make you do that.

168
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,210
Do what? You're right, Neil.

169
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,190
She's wrong.

170
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,700
Twilight.

171
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,470
MUSIC: "Baby Says" by The Kills

172
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,140
Twiglet? Yeah.

173
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,430
Twilight is my favourite film.

174
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,600
Of all the films in the world and you pick Twiglets?

175
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,360
Which one? You can't say all of them.

176
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,490
Would you separate Star Wars?

177
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,940
Look, there's things in them I like, admire even.

178
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:17,700
But as Mac says, there's a huge flaw. The Cullens shouldn't be going to school.

179
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,690
I mean, A, OK, the film goes out of its way to show

180
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,700
that Edward has graduated from dozens of high schools, you know,

181
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,130
caps on the wall, so it's not like he needs to be there for academic reasons,

182
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:30,010
and, um... Yeah, I have only actually watched these films once.

183
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:33,050
I just said them because...

184
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,790
And B, they clearly cast an actor who needs to shave twice a day,

185
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,270
so it's not like they'd struggle to lie to the authorities. And C, which is, um...

186
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,160
it's the most important one, is, er...

187
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,280
Jas... Jasper's, um...

188
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,300
You know, when you kiss me, I completely lose my thought... brain.

189
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,900
"Thought brain"? A brain you have thoughts in?

190
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,750
The thing is, Paul, I don't really care about films.

191
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,830
You don't care about... films?

192
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,350
No.

193
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,490
Any films?

194
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,660
No.

195
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,830
It's fair enough.

196
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,720
Oh, my God! 

197
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,640
Anna. Oh, shit.

198
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,720
You and Jay?

199
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,380
Jay and you.

200
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,580
You're pathetic. My brother?

201
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,540
My sad, twisted, lonely brother?

202
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,470
My fucking twin? You might was well be kissing me.

203
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,590
Only... not kissing me.

204
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,540
Kissing the worst part of me.

205
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,960
Kissing... my arse.

206
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,580
Stop. My ugly arse of a brother! Ha!

207
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,940
STOP!

208
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,700
Anna? What's up with her?

209
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,030
I don't... Shit, dude. Your hand's glowing.

210
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,650
You're a freak. An actual freak.

211
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,920
I don't... I didn't...

212
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,190
Make it stop. Paul!

213
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,980
I don't know how...

214
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:15,370
You really don't understand.

215
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,580
Anna.

216
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,680
Go away. I'm not going away. What was that?

217
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,390
Dunno. Why aren't you going after Jay anyway?

218
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,120
I wanted to talk to you first.

219
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,880
Well, why don't you just go see her? Go, fuck off and see her.

220
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,780
Um, who's "her"?

221
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:32,980
She's no-one. What's going on?

222
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:36,971
Paul is having sex with my best friend and then when I found them and shouted at him,

223
00:14:36,972 --> 00:14:38,380
 he did a magic spell on me.

224
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,620
You're having sex with Tracy? The other one.

225
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,280
Jay! Oh, I'm quite impressed with Jay.

226
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,250
Mum, that's not the point! He's got superpowers.

227
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,330
No, I-I-I...

228
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,220
That was a misunderstanding.

229
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,470
So you are admitting the sex bit? No!

230
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,660
I dunno. No... Oh!

231
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,310
God, look, you... you... you don't understand, OK?

232
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,640
Don't understand! Paul!

233
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,840
Do you want me to chase after you?

234
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,830
Then I'm going to cut off your dad's dick, pour dog chunks on it,

235
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:16,110
and feed it to the wolves. Your dick.

236
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,870
Your dick.

237
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:21,210
You're in fucking trouble now, boy.

238
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,800
Your dad let me up.

239
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,930
He, er... He seems pretty consumed with stuff. Is he OK?

240
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,150
One minute.

241
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,550
Stand down, noble...

242
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,160
Boomtang!

243
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,700
I could have been naked.

244
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:54,770
I've seen you naked. I could have been masturbating.

245
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:57,920
I've seen you masturbate. What? When?

246
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,410
The... school trip to Calais?

247
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,450
You were awake?

248
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:09,060
Yeah... Look, I need your help.

249
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,540
Do you? Yeah, well...

250
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,490
I sort of accidentally showed my sister,

251
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:19,700
my sort of... girlfriend and my sister's sort of boyfriend some of, um...

252
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,940
like, what I can do. The less-than-normal stuff. Right.

253
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,540
Yeah. Now they think I'm a freak.

254
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:30,880
Just... I need someone, you, to just... make it all OK again, because...

255
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,210
Please.

256
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,290
I'm really sorry, I... I can't.

257
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:39,480
What? Why can't you?

258
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,570
Paul, I'm tired, OK?

259
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,920
You're... tired?

260
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,120
Your best friend needs your help, and you're tired?

261
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,520
Tired who, tired how? I'm tired because I spent all day

262
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,820
wondering whether someone was going to shout "surprise" at me,

263
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,800
and no-one fucking did.

264
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,100
That's why.

265
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,180
And it's made me tired.

266
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:04,800
Shout "surprise"... What?! No, come on, you're not even making sense.

267
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,080
You're right.

268
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,470
I'm just going back to my computer game, OK?

269
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:13,320
It goes all funny if you leave it on pause for too long.

270
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,560
But I don't...

271
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,330
get it.

272
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,470
Contact neutralised. Fine!

273
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,940
What?

274
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,420
Are you going to try and hurt me again?

275
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:05,710
Because if you are, just get on with it, I've had a really shit day.

276
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:22,460
I don't have favourites. Yeah, but you're worried about him.

277
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,980
What did he do to you?

278
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,250
He zipped my mouth shut.

279
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,580
And he's sleeping with Jay?

280
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,570
Yes. Behind my back.

281
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,880
I don't know what's going on with this town...

282
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,640
and I don't know what's going on with my son, either.

283
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,560
It'd just be nice if you could... worry about me too.

284
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:46,440
I do... worry about you.

285
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,990
Paul. I'm going to bed, Mum.

286
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,480
You been out celebrating with Mac?

287
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,720
Celebrating... what? Look, I'm tired.

288
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,410
Don't you think we should talk?

289
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:03,510
I'm really... busy at the moment, Mum, OK?

290
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,300
Yeah! I know.

291
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,380
Celebrating what?

292
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,830
Oh, shit!

293
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:50,240
HAPPY BIRTH-YESTER-DAY 17+1

294
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,350
It took three cans of shaving foam.

295
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,210
The newsagent thought I was going for a whole body shave.

296
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:02,190
He advised me against it. Apparently, pubic stubble rash is a killer.

297
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:05,940
Good to know. What's a surprise if you're sort of expecting it?

298
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,230
The truly surprising birthday is one that takes place a day late.

299
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,910
So true.

300
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,960
I'm still learning how to...

301
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,730
balance who I am with what I... I know.

302
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:26,610
And you're probably still trying to balance who I am with what I...

303
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,020
I am.

304
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,960
And I've always been a bit self-centred. You have.

305
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,220
And I'm sorry.

306
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,910
Did I mention that I'm sorry?

307
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:46,640
How long were you waiting out here before I opened the curtains?

308
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,210
It was a while.

309
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,500
After three? Always.

310
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,020
One, two...

311
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,650
It's not the magic number. Far more likely to be seven.

312
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,110
Way more pagan connotations.

313
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:17,040
Also, a much more satisfying number to say.

314
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,790
Seven. Seven.

315
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:21,120
Se-ven.

316
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,150
Zap! You see that? Did ya?

317
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,100
Yeah. Did you see that?

318
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:34,840
Mama say knock you out.

319
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,320
Paul? 

320
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:45,930
Paul?

321
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,380
Paul? Paul? Paul!

322
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,030
Paul! Paul!

323
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,830
So...

324
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:18,070
This is... inevitable.

325
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,780
What was that?

326
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,240
I need to go to see Neil.

327
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,100
Was that a fit?

328
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,920
I had a cousin who was an epileptic. Well, he thought he was...

329
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,790
turned out he was just overtired, so...

330
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,100
I'm sorry.

331
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,150
Happy birth-yester-day.

332
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:46,350
I need... I need to go, alone.

333
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:49,290
Of course you do. I'll be waiting.

334
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:09,810
Hold still.

335
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:12,340
Right, who are you? And what are you doing here?

336
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,950
What? No, who are you? Let's try again, eh?

337
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:19,760
Who are you, and what are you doing? I'm... here to see Neil.

338
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,600
You're Paul, aren't you?

339
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:29,150
This is him? We heard all about you.

340
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:34,580
Thank you... for coming so quickly. Um...

341
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:38,350
I... You're here because... You look like shit, Neil.

342
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,540
I'll get to that. Start with that.

343
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,930
Who attacked you? Can I just...?

344
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:45,840
Neil, the only way to sort out our fears is to tell us what's going on.

345
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,460
OK. Just to make clear - I didn't want you here,

346
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:52,050
so fuck you if you think I'm not doing this my way!

347
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:56,600
There's a problem. The Fades can touch.

348
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,710
And they're attacking us.

349
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:01,860
They seem to be able to do this because they're eating human flesh,

350
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,190
and we have no idea how to stop them. Well,

351
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:07,860
that didn't make my fears go away. Anyone else's fears go away?

352
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,850
Sorry, but there you are. So we're in danger?

353
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:12,660
But we're not without hope. Why?

354
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:15,340
Because we've got a little kid who can save the world, eh?

355
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,430
A boy who I wouldn't even trust with a spud gun!

356
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:20,310
He has powers we don't even understand yet.

357
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:23,070
Eric thinks he's special.

358
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:26,320
Neil thinks he's special. Can I...?

359
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:29,010
As we're talking about me, shall I...?

360
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,780
Neil!

361
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:37,870
Oh, Jesus, Neil. You've been walking around with that?

362
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,550
For fuck's sake, how many dead Angelics do we need?

363
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,960
Let me look at him.

364
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,360
I can help him. Let me look at him.

365
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,180
You can help, can you?

366
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,500
Trust me. Trust you?

367
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,980
I told you to be careful, didn't I?

368
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,370
Then you let Alice and Phil jump you.

369
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:07,290
That's nothing. The Fade girl follows me everywhere.

370
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:11,080
She could probably jump me at any time.
Natalie? You stay away from her.

371
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,010
Look at me. You stay away from her!

372
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:16,050
Paul, you're not ready.
OK.

373
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,500
This probably won't hurt. Before you do this...

374
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,620
Do you know what you're doing?

375
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:30,440
Not even close. Feels right.

376
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,720
Just let it happen.

377
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,020
Tickle, don't they?

378
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:22,890
How do I look? Your eye...

379
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,770
He's done things I never could.

380
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,160
There was a reason I came to see you today.

381
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:44,470
Well, I hope it's because I called you, several times.

382
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,200
I had another vision.

383
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:50,990
Same as before, except there was a man in it.

384
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:54,290
He smiled at me, and then it cut out.

385
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,630
Is...? 

386
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,860
Am I seeing the end of the world, Neil?

387
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:08,160
Who was the man? Did you recognise him?

388
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:10,670
No...

389
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:16,430
I want you to move in here, with us.

390
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:19,130
Just until this is over. No. I can't.

391
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:23,630
Can't. I've got people to see.

392
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:28,840
What you just did in there, to help me, was extraordinary.

393
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,020
Extraordinary.

394
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,760
But the fact you can do that, that makes you valuable.

395
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,920
OK, fine. Don't move in here.

396
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,950
But there is someone out there that scares me.

397
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,170
So you just promise me this. Promise me

398
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:43,560
you won't ignore the "kill me" signs we've all got on our backs.

399
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,940
I need my own life, Neil.

400
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,600
Again, you're not listening to a word I say.

401
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:07,000
We need to capture one of them.
What, with our ghost rope?

402
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,810
If they can touch you, you can touch them.

403
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:13,690
Hey, we have a code, remember? Which they broke first.

404
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:17,790
It's time for us to act. Phil is right. We need to spread out,

405
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:20,090
find smaller, weaker Fades.

406
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:22,650
We do this now, before they get too strong.

407
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:27,770
And then what do we do, eh? Once we find this smaller, weaker Fade?

408
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,530
We find out its limits.

409
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:49,230
Neil. Hello, Mark.

410
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,810
I've been... I've been looking...

411
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:55,000
How did you know I've been looking for you?

412
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,500
I didn't.

413
00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:01,000
Mark, I'm not here for small talk. I'm here as a translator.

414
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,380
A translator? Are you going to invite me in?

415
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:16,090
What were you doing with my wife in a mental hospital?

416
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:23,130
I was rescuing her. I'll go through to the lounge, yeah?

417
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:25,050
I didn't think you'd ever come.

418
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:29,790
I almost died this afternoon.

419
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:34,800
It reminded me I had things to put right.

420
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:38,920
You're going to put us right, are you? I'm going to try.

421
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,330
Who are you talking to?

422
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,390
Sarah's dead.

423
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,450
You don't know that.

424
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:50,960
I do.
I'm sorry.

425
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:54,760
She's also a spirit

426
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:59,220
who has decided that the best use of her time is to follow you around.

427
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,040
She's... what?

428
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,620
This I'm also sorry about, because I think she's wrong.

429
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,760
But it's what she wants,

430
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,520
so I want to do the decent thing by her.

431
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,390
That's why I'm here as a translator, because...

432
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,210
I can talk to ghosts.

433
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,410
You were having an affair with her.

434
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:27,060
I just told you you're being haunted by the ghost of your wife, and you...

435
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:30,230
Neil, I need to have a serious conversation with you.

436
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:33,050
You were having an affair... Tell him something I wouldn't know.

437
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:35,700
I've got a feather tattooed on my arse.

438
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:41,010
She's got a feather on her bum.

439
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:43,920
Something you'd also know if you'd slept with her.

440
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,290
He called me Squidge for three months after we first got together

441
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:49,490
and then dropped it because he decided that he hated pet names.

442
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,150
You used to call her Squidge,

443
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:55,760
and then you dropped it because you didn't like pet names.

444
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:00,230
I don't want this bit. I'm calling the police.

445
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:02,610
Four days ago, I watched him sleep with a woman called Vicky...

446
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:04,130
Mark. Mark, please! And it broke my heart.

447
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,430
Four days ago, she - Sarah's ghost - saw you

448
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:08,620
sleeping with a woman called Vicky...

449
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,120
and it broke her heart.

450
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,810
There's no way I could know that.

451
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,090
Fuck off.

452
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:28,930
We were Angelics.
I still am one.

453
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:32,630
We're a different breed of people.

454
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:35,100
We were sworn to secrecy, Mark.

455
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:38,760
You two were my best friends,

456
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:42,530
so I'm here tonight to try to make it right for yous.

457
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,950
I don't understand...

458
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,760
She's dead?

459
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:53,800
Yeah. She's here now, Mark.

460
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:56,200
She doesn't want to leave you.

461
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,050
She's...

462
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:02,440
Let's all keep calm, and we'll ask her some questions, yeah?

463
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,730
She's... she's...

464
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,980
Am I looking at her? Yeah. Just about. She's...

465
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:19,350
I'm going to repeat what Sarah says word for word.

466
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,080
What do you want to ask her, Mark?

467
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:34,200
PAUL:WAKE UP!

468
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,520
I want to tell you about something wonderful.

469
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:02,770
I want to tell you about Gaia. What's Gaia?

470
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:05,800
Call yourself a geek? "What's Gaia?"

471
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,550
You're a disgrace to your community.

472
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,580
Did Neil Gaiman write it?

473
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:14,440
Look, do you want me to help fix it with Jay, or what?

474
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:18,200
Hmm? Right. In 2012,

475
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:22,130
we're sending the satellite Gaia into the galaxy

476
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:24,840
to take pictures of the stars.

477
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,030
What's this? Cough medicine.

478
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:40,330
Its billion-pixel camera will give scientists a 3D map of the sky.

479
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:42,570
Cough medicine? Takes the edge off.

480
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:47,700
It'll tell us about the Milky Way, how it works, how it started,

481
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:52,750
but the exciting thing is the things we're not expecting to see.

482
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:56,740
Asteroids, planets beyond our solar system,

483
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:59,760
tepid stars that never fired into life.

484
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,110
Extraordinary things we don't understand.

485
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,010
Now call her.

486
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,190
But I can't.

487
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,190
Yeah, you can.
Mac...

488
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,780
It's ringing. Mac.

489
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:34,520
I am not a morning person.

490
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,540
'Look out the window.'

491
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:48,610
'The point is... 'Gaia is extraordinary.

492
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:52,050
'It's going to show us amazing things we can't even contemplate.

493
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:55,540
'It's also really, really ordinary.'

494
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:58,270
Wow. That's a look.

495
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:00,010
Because you know what's best about Gaia?

496
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:03,400
Because... because do you want to know the best thing about Gaia?

497
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,250
Chelmsford and Stevenage.

498
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:08,910
Where it was made. Chelmsford and Stevenage.

499
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:12,170
A bunch of geeky men, sitting in a shit town

500
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,850
built something that would transform the way we look at the skies.

501
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:19,820
The things that scare you about me...

502
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,070
Imagine...

503
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:24,660
Imagine I'm Stevenage.

504
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:30,740
Some things have changed about me, but fundamentally I'm... I'm just ordinary.

505
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,550
I'm... Stevenage.

506
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,280
Smooth as.

507
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,830
So, you're Superman, right?

508
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:46,140
I can't hear you. Yes, you can. I can hear you.

509
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:50,210
Well, you must have supersonic hearing, then. I can't hear a word.

510
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:55,220
You're quite the loser, you know that? Hang on a minute.

511
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,270
I think this is the time when I do the alpha thing and say

512
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:10,010
you look great as you are. No "quite" about it - you're a loser!

513
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:12,430
Yeah. A loser. I know.

514
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,500
Now everyone knows about us.

515
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,180
I mean, effectively, I am your boyfriend.

516
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,110
So, can I tell people? Is that OK?

517
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,580
Not just a loser.

518
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,860
A total loser.

519
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:42,380
A loser that needs to go. What?

520
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:45,910
I need to go.

521
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,960
I'm sorry.

522
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,290
Have you got to save the world, or something?

523
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:54,080
I was actually joking about the Superman thing.

524
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,490
I'll be back.

525
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,430
You'd better be!

526
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:03,200
What...? Where are you going?

527
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:16,000
What are you doing here? Nice work.

528
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,490
We can take it from here. Yeah.

529
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:19,240
Get yourself back to your girlfriend.

530
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,150
There's your smaller, weaker Fade, right?

531
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,760
How are you feeling?

532
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:39,380
I can't get used to it.

533
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:43,200
Can't get used to what?

534
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,110
The fact I feel like I've had a rock of boiling lava

535
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:52,410
removed from my gut. I feel lighter.

536
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,660
It's beautiful here, isn't it?

537
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,690
Yeah?

538
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,300
You know, people misunderstand why Adam and Eve were thrown out of Eden.

539
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:06,770
They say it was knowledge that cost them.

540
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:10,690
The fruit of knowledge. That's a misreading.

541
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,450
It wasn't knowledge that cost them.

542
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,060
It was doubt.

543
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,000
They doubted what they were told

544
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,510
and so they couldn't see the beauty around them.

545
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:24,980
And they weren't thrown out.

546
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:30,420
Eden was still there, they were still in Eden,

547
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:34,590
only its beauty was lost to them.

548
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,430
Their own beauty was lost to them.

549
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:44,220
Well, I can see the beauty, so I'm lucky, aren't I?

550
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:47,610
No. No, you're not lucky.

551
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,990
Can you see the beauty, Neil?

552
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:52,970
Sarah thinks all of this is pointless.

553
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:56,940
That fate is coming. No point in fighting.

554
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:59,660
You just find someone you love and you stick to them.

555
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:03,000
Sarah's...weak.

556
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,290
She always has been. So you never doubt that we'll win?

557
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:12,070
It's not the absence of doubt. It's the conquering of it.

558
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:17,950
So, do you doubt me? Yeah.

559
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:20,250
You do?

560
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:22,540
I don't doubt your stamina, Neil.

561
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,270
I do doubt your strength.

562
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,100
Guys!

563
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:31,600
Some good news. The kid has caught us one of them.

564
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:39,950
She can scream. Her voice had rotted. She shouldn't be able to do that.

565
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:42,740
So, they're acquiring everything? Looks that way.

566
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,580
And what are we going to do with her?

567
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:47,240
We're going to find out where he is.

568
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,810
And we're going to show no mercy.

569
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,040
Tie her up.

570
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:11,320
Fraser reports she's dead. We got cause?

571
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:14,670
Yeah. Um, teeth.

572
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:18,170
To the neck. Teeth?

573
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:21,190
Yeah. Human teeth.

574
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:25,630
We've got a suspect?

575
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:28,390
No, nothing on anyone so far.

576
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:32,620
People... are having their necks ripped out...

577
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,070
with human teeth?

578
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,500
Yeah.

579
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:43,540
Kids... with human teeth?

580
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,230
Yeah.

581
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:51,770
Well, that's going to make people, er... jumpy.

582
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:57,100
Yeah, I know. And people are already jumpy.

583
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:01,240
Including my superiors, by the way.

584
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:04,700
Yeah. Look, I get it.

585
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:07,780
You're a good copper...

586
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:12,390
promoted way above his station by some affirmative-action bollocks.

587
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,320
That's not true.

588
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,380
I didn't want you to have this job,

589
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:20,740
not because I'm a racist, but because I didn't think you were up to it.

590
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:21,840
I know you didn't.

591
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:26,010
But you got it. You won.

592
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:28,890
And now you're a leader.

593
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:31,550
You lead a team.

594
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:36,190
And this team is in shit up to its eyeballs.

595
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:40,740
Its eyeballs are drowning in shit.

596
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,860
So sort it out.

597
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:45,090
Take some action.

598
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:49,340
Find a suspect, build a case. Do something.

599
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:13,670
OK, that was a look I wasn't expecting.

600
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:14,960
What look?

601
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,640
I've seen boys look pleased, I've seen boys look disappointed.

602
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,330
I've never seen a boy look quite so scared.

603
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:24,870
No, no, I'm not scared. I was just... I was thinking.

604
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:26,520
Thinking what?

605
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,840
And you're not allowed to say films

606
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,920
or what's-her-face from Mork And Mindy.

607
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,320
Pam Dawber.

608
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:39,230
I was thinking about you. I think you look nice.

609
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:52,570
You've got nice feet. And nice legs.

610
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,600
And, er, you've got nice... a nice, er...

611
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,840
bra and nice feet.

612
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:01,620
Did I already say feet?

613
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:09,480
Paul?

614
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,530
It's OK to be scared.

615
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:16,760
Oh! No. No, no, no.

616
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:19,480
No, no, no, I'm not... I'm not scared. I just...

617
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:22,890
This wasn't, um, exactly how...

618
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:26,920
how I expected this to, er, to go.

619
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,880
And what did you expect?

620
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,430
Have you ever played paper-scissors-stone?

621
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:44,410
Oh, no.

622
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:47,510
Oh, no. No, no, no. Seriously, I don't...

623
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:51,790
I think maybe we should just do a bit... a bit more kissing first.

624
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:58,240
this isn't 1955. Kids don't wait any more.

625
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:11,750
You don't have to marry me, or anything!

626
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:16,270
It's just... this feels right now, which is...

627
00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:18,790
I don't know whether it does feel right.

628
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:21,320
I mean, I've seen a lot of things today which...

629
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,740
Paul?

630
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:26,710
Just forget about all that, think about me.

631
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:30,360
OK.

632
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,490
OK? OK.

633
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,480
Yeah, but if we are... if we are doing this, then a quick warning.

634
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:45,540
If, um, at any point in this process I grow wings, don't be alarmed.

635
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,290
I'll try not to be.

636
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:49,370
OK.

637
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,060
Like that. OK. 

638
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:58,390
Don't push too hard. OK. Sorry.

639
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:01,730
That hurts. Oh, OK.

640
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:06,830
That doesn't. OK.

641
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:24,520
I don't know whether to...

642
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:29,670
I don't know what to do. You don't do anything.

643
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,070
It's just so hard, this...

644
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:39,490
knowing that you're there but knowing that you're not there.

645
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:40,680
I just...

646
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:44,940
wish I could touch you. I know.

647
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:46,960
But you know that.

648
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:53,960
You left me. We broke up. It was shit.

649
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:55,570
What...

650
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:59,370
What changed? Are you stuck because of me?

651
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:01,190
Are we in a fucking film?

652
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,380
Are you...

653
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:06,400
Do you still...

654
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:08,610
love me?

655
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:15,430
I wish you could answer that question without having to ask Neil.

656
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,300
Coming.

657
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:30,030
Mark Etches.

658
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:33,060
I have a warrant to search these premises. What?!

659
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:34,400
What's this about?

660
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:45,540
My name is Detective Chief Inspector Armstrong.
I know who you fucking are.

661
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:48,960
I have to formally identify myself... Why are you here?

662
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,280
What do you think I've done?

663
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:53,600
I'm arresting you on suspicion of your connection

664
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:57,220
to the disappearance of Sarah Etches. My wife?!

665
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:00,250
You think I have anything to do with Sarah's death?

666
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:02,240
And Helen Marshall,

667
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:05,290
and the murders of Sam Griegson and Fred Taylor.

668
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:08,730
Murder?
You don't have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you...

669
00:48:08,730 --> 00:48:10,400
How can you think...

670
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:13,580
What possible evidence do you have?

671
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:17,760
You have connections with all the victims.
You assaulted Sam Griegson a few days ago...

672
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,110
Yeah, we sorted that out. Desperate men do desperate things.

673
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:37,560
So...

674
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:41,040
So?

675
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:49,980
Well, go on, then, spit it out.

676
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:52,090
How was it?

677
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,560
You know...

678
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:59,380
Nice, actually. What's it feel like?

679
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:05,180
It's hotter than expected.
That's probably a good sign.

680
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:06,420
Yeah.

681
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:09,600
Though it was quite difficult... to fit.

682
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,480
That's probably a good sign, too!

683
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:14,690
Yeah? Yeah.

684
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,800
I never gave you your present, did I? For your birthday.

685
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:27,890
Ah, you didn't need to. Yeah, I did.

686
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:29,160
You totally did.

687
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,020
It's a key.

688
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:38,690
Am I supposed to break it off and then give half to you

689
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:40,460
and wear my bit round my neck?

690
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:43,850
Are we in love? Because I'm flattered, but...

691
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:45,450
It's to my house.

692
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:52,810
Any time... Any time things at home with your mum, with your dad,

693
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:58,270
3am, whenever, you just come to my place,

694
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:01,150
sleep on the sofa, sleep in my room, whatever you like.

695
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:04,680
You're always welcome... because you're family.

696
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:09,890
I've cleared it with Mum.

697
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:13,180
OK. You do know, don't you,

698
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:16,630
that whatever happens with Jay, you'll always be more important to me, right?

699
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:17,860
Yeah.

700
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:23,070
You do know I'm going to use this key to steal your sister's knickers, right?

701
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:26,660
Did you just flick ice cream at me?

702
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:31,460
Don't throw your bloody ice cream at me.

703
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:35,170
I'm going to comb through your photo albums and find pictures of your sister in a bikini. No, I'm not listening to you.

704
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:37,160
I'm not listening! And your mum breast-feeding.

705
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:40,630
Then I'm going to snoop for dildodatic devices. Paul!

706
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:06,570
This is going to be fine.

707
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:14,200
This is going to be fine.

708
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,300
It's happening, Neil.

709
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:48,160
Is it?

710
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:54,910
You see? I was right not to have doubted.

711
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:57,900
No.

712
00:51:58,970 --> 00:52:02,360
No, I'm not ready. Keep the boy safe.

713
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:06,730
It's beautiful, Neil.

714
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:09,390
I'm not ready. You can't go.

715
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:12,420
You're right, I'm not strong enough.

716
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,760
I'm not strong... Helen?

717
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:15,920
Helen?

718
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:39,900
