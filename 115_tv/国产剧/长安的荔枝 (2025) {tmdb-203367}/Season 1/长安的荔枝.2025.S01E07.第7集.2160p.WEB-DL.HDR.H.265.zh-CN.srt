00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:04,890
《旺达幻视》前情提要
Previously on WandaVision...

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,700
你已经进入边界两次了  莫妮卡
You've gone through the boundary twice already, Monica.

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:09,640
里面的能量
The energy inside has

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,830
在分子层面上两次改写了你的细胞
re-written your cells on a molecular level twice.

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,810
我知道旺达的感受  不帮到她我不罢休
I know what Wanda's feeling and I won't stop until I help her.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,450
我想联系西景镇外界
It is my intention to reach those outside of Westview

7
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,630
弄清我们现在的状况
and make sense of our situation.

8
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,960
帮帮里面的人
The people need help.

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,900
妈妈  妈妈
Mom! Mom!

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,080
什么  怎么了  比利
What? What is it, Billy?

11
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,250
我听见了爸爸的声音  他出事了
I hear Dad. He's in trouble.

12
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,530
你那死人丈夫又不会死第二回
It's not like your dead husband can die twice.

13
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,570
马克西莫夫本就不可能跟我们谈判
Maximoff was never gonna negotiate with us.

14
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,220
我们打不过她
We can't outgun her.

15
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,940
显然  跟她对立只让事情更糟了
And clearly antagonizing her is only making things worse.

16
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,280
如果旺达是问题所在  那解铃还须系铃人
If Wanda is the problem, she has to be our solution.

17
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,040
该死
Oh, fudge!

18
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:37,030
漫威

19
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:37,030
影业

20
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,400
我们都经历过  是吧
Look, we've all been there, right?

21
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,100
被恐惧和愤怒控制
Letting our fear and anger get the best of us,

22
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,360
有意扩展了
intentionally expanding

23
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,140
我们创造了虚构世界的范围
the borders of the false world we created.

24
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,920
让开  让开
Move it! Move it!

25
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,920
妈妈  你会很快下来吗
Mom, are you coming down soon?

26
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,540
妈妈  我们的电游在发疯
Mom, our game is freaking out.

27
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,350
她在睡觉吗
Is she asleep?

28
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,080
妈妈没在睡觉
Mommy's not sleeping, honey.

29
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,190
她在休息眼睛
She's just resting her eyes.

30
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,950
妈妈  我的脑袋感觉好怪
Mom, my head feels weird.

31
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,140
好吵
It's, like, really noisy.

32
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,800
我不喜欢
I don't like it.

33
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:40,290
休息眼睛
Resting her eyes.

34
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,660
为了惩罚我鲁莽的一晚
As punishment for my reckless evening,

35
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,570
我打算进行隔离形式的家里蹲
I plan on taking a quarantine-style staycation.

36
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,860
一整天
A whole day...

37
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,500
就我自己
just to myself.

38
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,080
这能让我知道错
That'll show me.

39
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,650
我先拿的
I got to it first!

40
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,300
你总是先拿
You always get to it first!

41
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,880
杏仁奶

42
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,350
西景乳业  维D牛奶  纯天然

43
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,930

44
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,050
西景乳业

45
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,840
西景乳业

46
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,700
嗯  我也不知道那怎么回事
Yeah, I'm not sure what that's about.

47
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,800
可能是只是周一的问题
It's probably just a case of the Mondays.

48
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,140
是吧
Am I right?

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,080
你好
我叫


50
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,010

旺达

61
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,140
旺达

62
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:14,850
抱歉  我们




63
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:15,300
旺达

64
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:15,680
旺达

65
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,010
旺达

66
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:16,760
知道你在做什么吗


67
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,180
旺达薯条牛排

68
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:17,550
旺达

69
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:17,950
旺达

70
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,310
旺达

71
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,680
旺达

72
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,060
旺达

73
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,430
旺达

74
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:19,810
旺达

75
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:20,190
旺达

76
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:20,560
旺达

77
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:20,940
旺达

78
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,400
我爱
旺达

79
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,270
旺达

80
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,580
幻视

81
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,580
旺达

82
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,580
第七集

天剑局临时驻点


85
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,360
我们真幸运  她最终住手了
Lucky for us, she pumped the brakes.

86
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,340
是啊  我可真幸运
Yeah. I feel very lucky.

87
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,750
放送信号怎么样了
What's happening with the broadcast?

88
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,710
毫无动静  信号没了
Dead air. The signal's gone.

89
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,990
务必确保团队什么都不缺
Make sure the team has everything they need.

90
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,380
我们今天发射
We launch today.

91
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,550
是  长官
Yes, sir.

92
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,250
你是新小丑吗
You're the new clown?

93
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,430
至少你已经化好妆了
At least you're already in makeup.

94
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,180
你跟逃脱大师的彩排迟到了
You're late for rehearsal with the escape artist.

95
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,240
来吧
Come on.

96
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,900
嗯  老实说  我不怎么擅长这活儿
Yeah, I'm not great at this gig, I gotta be honest.

97
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,360
跟我的技能不怎么相称
It doesn't really speak to my skill set.

98
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:50,900
我本想做胡子女
I put in for the bearded lady,

99
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:55,150
但这种雪花石膏的肤色骗不了任何人
but this alabaster complexion wasn't fooling anyone.

100
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,540
有事吗  变态
Can I help you, creeper?

101
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,160
你不记得我们昨晚的事了吗
You don't remember me from last night?

102
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:08,340
我们目光相对过  有种不言的理解
We locked eyes. There was a unspoken understanding.

103
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,980
少他妈来了吧
Um, hard pass.

104
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,540
不  等等  等等
No, wait. Wait up.

105
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,570
你们看到爸爸了吗
Have you seen your dad?

106
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,920
没
Um, no.

107
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,680
你要去找他吗
Do you wanna go look for him?

108
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,620
如果他不想待在这里
Well, if he doesn't wanna be here,

109
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,500
我也没办法
there's nothing I can do about it.

110
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,140
五日天气预报
周一到周五晴天  周日可能多云

111
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,040
妈妈  昨晚
Hey, Mom, last night,

112
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,100
皮舅舅说什么要再杀爸爸一次
Uncle P said that thing about re-killing Dad?

113
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,740
别相信那男人说的任何话  他不是你们的舅舅
Don't believe anything that man said. He is not your uncle.

114
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,280
那他是谁
Who is he?

115
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,850
是这样的  孩子们
Here's the thing, boys.

116
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,660
我是你们妈妈
I'm your mom.

117
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,330
因此
And as such,

118
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:54,560
你们会指望我什么都知道  是吧
you were counting on me to have all the answers, right?

119
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,210
但我不是的
Well, I don't.

120
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,910
我...
I have...

121
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,170
什么都不知道
no answers.

122
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,450
一点都不
Zip. Zero. Zilch.

123
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,150
完全不
Nada. Niente.

124
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:11,420
我开始认为
I'm starting to believe

125
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,510
一切都是
that everything is...

126
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,900
无意义的
meaningless.

127
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,490
你们当然可以自己得出结论
You're welcome to draw your own conclusions, of course,

128
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,620
但我现在是这样想的
but that's just where I'm at.

129
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,970
好吧  或许我那是有点黑暗了
Okay. So maybe I went a little too dark there,

130
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,450
但他们会没事的
but they'll be fine.

131
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:32,150
幻视可是振金的  他们继承了坚强的外壳
Vision is made of vibranium. They literally inherited tough skin.

132
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,140
来吧
Come on.

133
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,730
艾格妮丝  进来吧
Hi, Agnes. Come on in.

134
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:43,940
我该起来  但我不想
I'd get up, but I just don't want to.

135
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,100
我觉得我出现得非常及时
But I think I got there in the nick of time

136
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,830
不然她可能差点就要自己剪刘海了
'cause she was one split end away from cutting her own bangs.

137
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,890
孩子们  给你妈妈一点私人时间吧
Hey, boys, why don't we give your mom some me time?

138
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,000
艾格尼丝  你确定吗
Agnes, are you sure?

139
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,120
绝对确定
Oh, abso-positively.

140
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,030
-来  走吧  -我们一定要走吗  妈妈
- Come on, let's go, guys. - Do we have to, Mom?

141
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,210
得有人留在这里照顾你啊
Someone needs to be here to take care of you.

142
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:12,070
孩子们  我没事的  和艾格尼丝去吧
Boys, I'll be fine. Just go with Agnes.

143
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,230
我保证我不会咬人
I promise I won't bite.

144
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,240
我其实以前咬过一个孩子
I actually did bite a kid once.

145
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:22,300
艾格尼丝  你简直是我的救星
Agnes, you are a life-saver.

146
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,670
-有什么我能帮你做的吗  -你知道吗
- Is there anything I can do for you? - You know what?

147
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:29,670
我背上看不见得地方好像是长了一个痦子
I do have a suspicious mole on my back that I just can't see.

148
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,460
距离感  我明白
Boundaries. I get it.

149
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,790
不用多说
Say no more.

150
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,450
好了  先生们  赶紧走吧
All right, gentlemen, let's keep it moving.

151
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,810
你们知道吗  要是你们俩能帮我看一眼
You know what? If one of you two could take a quick look,

152
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,520
那真是太感激了  就在我的...
I'd appreciate it. It's right here above my...

153
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:07,370
...在球门外展开了完美得进攻
...delivering flawless offensive plays right out of the gate.

154
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,710
最后的进球是精彩...
The final goal scored with a remark...

155
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:16,510
我没事  我没事  我没事
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

156
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,100
我没事
I'm fine.

157
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,210
我没事
I'm fine.

158
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,610
天剑局

159
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,260
达西穿过了最后一道防火墙
Darcy made it through that last firewall, all right.

160
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,510
她有什么发现
Oh, what'd she find?

161
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,030
研发报告  都是同一个项目的
R and D reports. All on the same project.

162
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,190
达西・刘易斯
你好  吉米  我突破了防火墙
有很多关于同一个项目的研究报告  代号幻光
我发现了幻视身体的构造图  海沃德没有解构幻视
他是想要利用天剑局的资源让他复活  他尝试了很多次
但是都没有用  直到旺达偷走了幻视的尸体
这是他给幻视办公室发的假公报
达西

163
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,080
代号  幻光
Code name, Cataract.

164
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,300
海沃德没有解构幻视
Hayward wasn't decommissioning Vision.

165
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,920
他想要复活幻视  但是一直没有成功  直到...
He was trying to bring him back online. Nothing worked until...

166
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,150
旺达偷走了幻视的尸体
Wanda stole Vision's body.

167
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,080
所以他如此执着于在六边域里找到幻视
That's why he was so focused on tracking Vision inside the Hex.

168
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,590
海沃德要拿回他的有意识武器
Hayward wants his sentient weapon back.

169
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,440
这件事得找人告诉旺达
Someone has to tell Wanda.

170
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,400
看  他们在那里
Look. There they are.

171
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,670
-古德纳少校  -兰博上尉
- Major Goodner. - Captain Rambeau.

172
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,140
这是吴探员
This is Agent Woo.

173
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,580
认识你很高兴
Nice to meet you.

174
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,440
非常感谢你的到来
Thank you so much for coming.

175
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,740
我的母亲会很感谢你的忠心
My mother would appreciate your loyalty.

176
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,120
我们不仅只听命于她  上尉
She's not the only one we're loyal to, Captain.

177
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,650
让我带你去看看我们带来了什么
Let me show you what we brought you.

178
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,750
符合你的期待规模吗
Did we get your specs right?

179
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,960
太完美了
She's perfect.

180
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:10,350
天剑局

181
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:24,900
喂  不好意思  你之前想帮我的
Hello? Excuse me. Uh, you tried to help me.

182
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,690
那可不一定  我是出了名的自私自利
Doubtful. I'm notoriously self-involved.

183
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:29,450
不不不  拜托  听我说
No, no, no. Please. Just hear me out.

184
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,600
好吧  我相信你是隶属于
All right. I believe that you were part of a team

185
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,460
一个专门监管超自然现象的团队  现在...
monitoring a supernatural anomaly. And now...

186
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,790
你也进来了
Well, you're in it.

187
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:42,180
好吧  我愿意和你约会  但我要点龙虾
Fine. I'll go out with you, but I'm ordering the lobster.

188
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,310
不  看  那个演哑剧的  他的盘子太重了
Oh, no. Look, that mime... His tray is getting too heavy.

189
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,080
你的腰不好
Oh, your bad back!

190
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,020
哇哦  好吧
Whoa! Okay. Ooh.

191
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,210
-醒了吗  -嗯
- Awake? - Ooh, uh, yeah.

192
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,280
没事吧
All right?

193
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,210
你好啊  我自己
Oh, hello, self.

194
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:03,840
我内心是有点偷偷想客串这部戏
You know, part of me secretly wanted a guest spot on the show,

195
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,030
但说真的  那糟糕透了
but seriously, that sucked.

196
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,910
你叫什么名字  你的真名
Look, uh, what is your name? Your real name?

197
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,360
达西・刘易斯
Darcy Lewis.

198
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,320
达西・刘易斯博士
Dr. Darcy Lewis.

199
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,200
我截获了一封关于你的研究的信
I intercepted a communication regarding your work.

200
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,300
狮子刚下场  该你们上了
Hey, the lions just got off stage. You're up.

201
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,590
刘易斯博士  我有好多问题
Dr. Lewis, I have questions.

202
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,000
我有答案
I have answers.

203
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,090
我们要不要开这车上路
Ooh, should we take this convo on the road?

204
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,660
-太好了  -该你俩上场了
- Excellent. - You two are up.

205
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,010
不行  真抱歉  博士和我早就约好了
No, I'm so sorry. Doctor and I have a prior engagement.

206
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,160
她哪也不许去
She's not goin' anywhere.

207
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,800
不  我的鼻子
Oh, no! My nose!

208
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,470
-抱歉  -快走
- Sorry. - Come on.

209
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,690
-借过  -你俩要去哪
- Oh. Excuse me. - Where do you think you're going?

210
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,120
给我回来
Get back here!

211
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,840
去你家吗
To your house, I assume?

212
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:46,730
刘易斯博士  我想问  我的孩子们安全吗
Dr. Lewis, my questions, are my children safe?

213
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:47,880
我不知道
That I don't know.

214
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,190
那个冒牌货皮特是谁
Who is that imposter, Pietro?

215
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,480
问倒我了
Beats me.

216
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,810
-我们走吧  -太好了
- Let's roll. - Great.

217
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,500
-给我出来  -抱歉  听不清你说什么
- Get out of there. - Sorry. Can't hear you.

218
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,440
-什么  -快开车啊
- What? - Drive!

219
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:04,920
实在对不起  经纪人把我们的时间约重了
I'm so sorry. We were double-booked by the agents.

220
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,490
你们必须上场
You got to be on stage.

221
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,230
-踩油门啊  达西  -你们在干什么
- Step on it, Darcy! - What are you doing?

222
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:08,920
我听不见你说什么
No, I can't hear you.

223
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,320
你们给我回来  我需要你们
You get back here! I need you!

224
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,900
我不明白这是怎么回事
I don't understand what's happening.

225
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,350
为什么...
Why it's...

226
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,120
为什么一切都崩溃了  为什么...
Why it's all falling apart and why...

227
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,180
我没办法解决
I can't fix it.

228
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:57,450
是不是因为你罪有应得
Do you think maybe this is what you deserve?

229
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,540
什么
What?

230
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,050
你不该说话的
You're not supposed to talk.

231
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,480
感觉抑郁
Feeling depressed?

232
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:15,110
觉得世界没了自己也能继续
Like the world goes on without you?

233
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,760
只想独处吗
Do you just want to be left alone?

234
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,240
向您的医生咨询下"链结"
Ask your doctor about Nexus.

235
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,300
链结

236
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:23,880
一种独特的抗抑郁药物
A unique anti-depressant

237
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:26,990
能将您锚定回现实中
that works to anchor you back to your reality.

238
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:29,270
链结

239
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:29,740
或者您选择的现实
Or the reality of your choice.

240
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:40,320
链结

241
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,680
副作用包括感觉到自己的感受
Side effects include feeling your feelings,

242
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,810
面对真相  抓住命运
confronting your truth, seizing your destiny,

243
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,570
而且很可能导致抑郁加深
and possibly, more depression.

244
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:37,780
除非医生允许您继续生活
You should not take Nexus

245
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,010
否则请勿使用"链结"
unless your doctor has cleared you to move on with your life.

246
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:48,840
链结

247
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:45,840
"链结"  因为世界并不是围着您转的
Nexus, because the world doesn't revolve around you.

248
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,040
也可能是呢
Or does it?

249
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,310
萨米
Hey, Sammy.

250
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,150
有人渴了吗
Okay, who's thirsty?

251
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,370
这有饮料
Some bevs.

252
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,970
你在想什么呢
Penny for your thoughts.

253
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,520
我喜欢这里
I like it here.

254
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,000
那很好啊
Oh, good.

255
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:13,700
是因为挠挠先生会耐心听你倾诉吗
Is it because Se?or Scratchy is such a good listener?

256
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,750
不是
No.

257
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,010
是因为这里很安静
It's because it's quiet.

258
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,200
你很安静  艾格尼丝
You're quiet, Agnes.

259
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,490
你的内心
On the inside.

260
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,980
你觉得我们妈妈没事吗
Do you think our mom is okay?

261
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,810
当然没事了
Oh, for sure!

262
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:45,860
你们不用担心你们妈妈
Oh, you don't have to worry about your mom.

263
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:50,200
她无所不能  是超人妈妈
Your mom can do anything. She's supermom.

264
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,780
拉夫说我喜欢粉饰太平
Ralph says I sugarcoat things.

265
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,120
但你试试告诉一个十岁孩子
But you try telling a 10-year-old

266
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,040
他妈妈逼疯了
that his mother is cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

267
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,710
最后检查
Final checks.

268
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,020
一切准备就绪  上尉
We're all set, Captain.

269
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,660
谢谢
Thank you.

270
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,630
达西不在这里  没法给你认可
Darcy's not here to give her stamp of approval.

271
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,150
我知道
I know.

272
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:27,080
她在里面  我会进去救她出来
She's in there and I'm gonna go get her out.

273
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,930
这是我们的最后一搏  吉米
It's our last shot, Jimmy.

274
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:37,970
祝成功  上尉
Godspeed, Captain.

275
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,410
你对这玩意有多大信心
How much faith you have in this thing?

276
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,020
这是我们防御力最强的太空车
It's our most heavily-armored space rover.

277
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,390
她能直接开进去  毫发不伤
She's gonna sail right through. Unharmed.

278
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,360
检查上尉的通讯设备
Capcom, check.

279
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:16,400
没问题
Good, check.

280
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:18,510
听你的指令  上尉
On your order, Captain.

281
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:21,740
出发
Moving out.

282
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:41,960
接触倒计时  五  四  三
Contact in five, four, three...

283
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,850
二  一
two, one.

284
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,600
不是说能直接开进去吗
What happened to sailing right through?

285
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,120
密度正和她匹配
The density is matching her.

286
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,330
我快成功了  屏障会被冲破
I'm close. It's gonna give!

287
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,810
结构完整性在降低
The structural integrity is failing.

288
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:17,830
正在瓦解
It's disintegrating.

289
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,380
不  是正在重写
No, it's being rewritten.

290
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,900
莫妮卡  快下车
Monica, get out of there!

291
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,540
听到吗  莫妮卡
Do you copy, Monica?

292
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,170
莫妮卡  快下车
Monica! Get out of there!

293
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:31,710
莫妮卡
Monica!

294
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,560
快派救伤直升机
Get a medevac, now!

295
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,070
当心
Watch out!

296
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,390
不  不要
No. No.

297
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:04,860
我能穿过去
I can get through.

298
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,100
莫妮卡  不
Monica! No!

299
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:24,600
不  我不能  我不能丢下莫妮卡
No, I can't. I can't leave Monica.

300
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,060
妈妈  没事
Mommy, it's okay.

301
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,580
我可以去外婆外公家住
I can stay with Grandma and Pop-Pop.

302
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,960
我不能去  宝贝  太危险了
There's no way I'm going, baby. It's too dangerous.

303
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,540
妈妈  或许我可以飞上天  和你中途相会
Mom, maybe I could fly up and meet you halfway?

304
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:40,290
那你得学会像卡罗尔阿姨那样发光
Only if you learn to glow like your Aunt Carol.

305
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,480
你是我认识的最强大的人
And you were the most powerful person I knew.

306
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,690
你妈妈死了  亲爱的
Your mom, she died, honey.

307
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,050
她激励了我们
She was truly an inspiration.

308
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,940
-很遗憾  -不
- Sorry. - No!

309
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,390
你妈妈很幸运
Your mom's lucky.

310
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:54,370
天上发孩子时  给了她最坚强的一个
When they were handing out kids, they gave her the toughest one.

311
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,300
所以旺达杀了我吗
So, Wanda killed me?

312
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:51,730
是的  但没那么简单  是你叫她这么做的
Yes, but it's not that simple. You asked her to do it.

313
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,380
我为什么要那么做
Why would I have done that?

314
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,610
拯救全宇宙
To save the universe.

315
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,180
一半的宇宙
Well, half of it.

316
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,110
有效果吗
Did it work?

317
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,810
有啊
It did.

318
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:05,590
但是反派逆转了时间  亲自杀了你
Until the bad guy rewound time and killed you himself.

319
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,290
虽然中间还有其他小插曲
There are a few extra steps,

320
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:08,680
但是长话短说
but to set up the context...

321
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,420
我回到过去  又死了一次
I came back and died again.

322
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,160
还让她亲眼看着你死去
And she had to watch.

323
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,770
不是吧  又是红灯
Oh, man, another red light?

324
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,770
在这么偏僻的地方设置红绿灯没必要吧
It's kinda overkill out in the sticks here,

325
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:21,440
你觉得呢
don't you think?

326
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:23,620
是啊
Yes.

327
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:31,990
我觉得  是旺达创造了这些障碍
I believe... I think that Wanda is creating

328
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:36,200
不让我回家
these impediments to stop me returning home.

329
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,240
再说  西景也没下过雨吧
Also, it never rains in Westview, right?

330
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,670
我很不开心
I'm not amused.

331
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,890
前方
施工

332
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:03,650
行吧  你们慢慢干吧
Yeah, great. Just take your time, fellas.

333
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,010
如果我理解正确的话
So if I understand correctly,

334
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:11,480
我最初是一个名叫贾维斯的人工智能
my original code dates back to an AI called Jarvis?

335
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:14,410
但是我的身体
But my corporeal form

336
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:19,070
是奥创企图灭绝人类计划的产物
was born of Ultron's plan for global genocide?

337
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:20,840
完全正确
Correct-o.

338
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,350
那我现在是什么
What am I now?

339
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,510
老实说  我是研究理工科的
Honestly, I'm a STEM type of lady,

340
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:32,370
所以我觉得她打开了你脑袋里的开关
so I thought she just flipped a switch on your head

341
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,460
让你起死回生
and brought you back to life,

342
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:37,890
但是我不明白你为什么不能离开六边域
but what I don't get is why you can't leave the Hex.

343
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,360
但是我知道的是
What I do know is I've

344
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:48,430
上周我一直在看《旺达幻视》
been watching WandaVision for the past week.

345
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,940
你们俩之间的爱意是真的
And the love you two have is real.

346
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,040
你们是天生一对
You belong together.

347
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:17,570
旺达  旺达
Wanda? Wanda!

348
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:18,500
你在做什么
What are you doing?

349
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,960
-旺达  -你是怎么进来的
- Wanda... - How did you get in here?

350
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,380
听我说  一切都是为了幻视
Listen to me. This whole thing is about Vision.

351
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,030
-离开我家  -海沃德想让他...
- Get out of my house. - Hayward was trying to bring him...

352
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:28,530
别跟我说这些  我根本不想听
Don't talk to me about that. I don't wanna hear about it.

353
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,990
无人机  导弹  皮特
The drones, the missiles. Pietro?

354
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,540
不  等等  皮特不是我们安排的
No, wait, Pietro, no, no, no, that wasn't us.

355
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,410
你们只会说谎
All you do is lie!

356
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,650
我说过的只有你让我说的谎言
The only lies I've told are the ones you put in my mouth.

357
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:52,570
注意你的言辞
Careful what you say to me.

358
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,770
来啊
Do it, then.

359
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:00,980
把我扔出去
Take me out.

360
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,990
你看  这就是你和海沃德不一样的地方
See, see? That's where you and Hayward differ.

361
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,840
他为了达到目的
He's gonna burn Westview to the ground

362
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,140
不惜把西景镇烧成灰烬
just to get what he wants.

363
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,310
不要让他把你变成凶手
Don't let him make you the villain.

364
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,620
或许我就是凶手
Maybe I already am.

365
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,240
我不怕你  旺达
I'm not afraid of you, Wanda.

366
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:30,580
我也失去了我最亲近的人
I lost the person closest to me, too.

367
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:33,370
我可以想象的最糟糕的事情
The worst thing I can think of

368
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:34,890
已经发生了
has already happened to me

369
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,590
我无力改变  无法挽回
and I can't change it. I can't undo it.

370
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:40,330
我不能再隐瞒这种痛苦了
I can't control this pain anymore.

371
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:44,770
我也不想隐瞒了  因为这就是我的真相
And I don't think I want to, because it's my truth.

372
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:49,830
旺达  你要
Wanda, you have to...

373
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,960
女士  你好像有点得寸进尺了
Young lady, I think you overstayed your welcome.

374
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,630
可怜的旺达已经经历够多了
Poor Wanda's been through enough.

375
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:00,350
这跟你没关系  旺达
This doesn't concern you. Wanda...

376
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:01,690
离开吧
Run along, dear.

377
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,230
-旺达  你必须解开这里  -绝不
- Wanda, you have to take it down. - No.

378
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:11,280
-别逼我伤害你  -好了
- Don't make me hurt you. - All right.

379
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,390
好了  咱们收工吧
Okay, let's wrap it up.

380
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,510
终于结束了
Yes, finally.

381
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,480
停

382
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,750
拜托了
Oh, come on!

383
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,100
孩子们  快跟上
Come on, kids.

384
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:43,120
孩子们  然后呢  再来一群小狗吗
Kids? What's next, puppies?

385
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,450
我完全想象不到
I had no idea how much

386
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,690
旺达来西景之前到底忍受了多少痛苦
Wanda had endured before coming to Westview,

387
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:48,890
我想应该说我们都忍受了很多
how much we both had, I guess.

388
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,490
虽然我不记得了
Though I can't remember it.

389
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:54,410
对我来说  就像发生在别人身上的事一样
For me, it feels like it happened to someone else, you know?

390
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:55,690
但是对她来说
But for her...

391
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,160
这就是几周前的事
It's mere weeks ago.

392
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:06,860
我在干什么呢  坐着和你谈心  我明明应该
What am I doing here, sitting, talking to you when I should...

393
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:11,110
这真是  这太可笑了  我得去找我妻子了
This is... This is absurd. I need to get to my wife.

394
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,760
那我就去那里和你汇合是吧
So I'll just meet you there, then?

395
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,270
过来
Oh, here.

396
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,990
亲爱的  要不要喝杯茶
Would you like a cup of tea, hon?

397
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,670
-好的  谢谢你  艾格尼丝  -没问题
- Sure. Thank you, Agnes. - Okay.

398
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:32,420
坐吧  我去泡茶  马上回来
Sit down. Be right back with that.

399
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:41,470
跳呀  跳呀  跳呀
Jump! Jump! Jump!

400
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,620
跳起来  跳呀  跳呀  跳呀
Jumpy, jump, jump, jump, jump

401
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,190
跳起来  跳呀  跳呀  跳呀
Jumpy, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump

402
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,360
跳起来  跳呀  跳呀  跳呀
Jumpy, jump, jump, jump, jump

403
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,200
跳起来  跳呀  跳呀  跳呀
Jumpy, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump

404
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,310
我的孩子们在哪儿
Where are the twins?

405
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:11,710
他们可能就在地下室里玩呢
Oh, they're probably just playing in the basement.

406
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:28,660
孩子们
Boys?

407
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:55,600
汤米
Tommy?

408
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:00,310
比利
Billy?

409
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,820
旺达呀旺达
Wanda, Wanda.

410
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:47,410
你不会以为镇上就你一个人会法术吧
You didn't think you were the only magical girl in town, did you?

411
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,720
我叫阿加莎・哈克尼斯
The name's Agatha Harkness.

412
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,540
终于和你正式见面了  亲爱的
Lovely to finally meet you, dear.

413
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,740
? 是谁一直在背后搞鬼 ?
? Who's been messing up everything ?

414
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:16,000
? 一直都是阿加莎 ?
? It's been Agatha all along ?

415
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:18,460
一直
都是
阿加莎

416
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,830
? 是谁一直在幕后操控一切 ?
? Who's been pulling every evil string ?

417
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:24,350
? 一直都是阿加莎 ?
? It's been Agatha all along ?

418
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:28,270
领衔主演
阿加莎・哈克尼斯

419
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:29,750
? 她阴险又狡猾 ?
? She's insidious ?

420
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:35,150
? 她是如此奸诈狡猾  而你根本无法察觉 ?
? So perfidious that you haven't even noticed ?

421
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,580
? -而且可惜的是  -可惜的是 ?
? - And the pity is - The pity is ?

422
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,460
? 可惜可惜  太可惜 ?
? Pity, pity, pity, pity ?

423
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,210
? 一切为时已晚  不能回头 ?
? It's too late to fix anything ?
