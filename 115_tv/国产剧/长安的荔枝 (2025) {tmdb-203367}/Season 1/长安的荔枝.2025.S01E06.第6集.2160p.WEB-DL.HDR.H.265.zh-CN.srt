《旺达幻视》前情提要
Previously on WandaVision...

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,490
你根本没有费心隐藏你的超能力
You made no effort to conceal your abilities.

3
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,630
-我不想再躲躲藏藏了  小幻  -你有什么瞒着我的
- Well, I'm tired of hiding, Vis. - What aren't you telling me?

4
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:18,990
你得阻止她
You have to stop her.

5
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,400
让她停下
Just make her stop!

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,120
你不能像控制别人那样控制我
You can't control me the way you do them.

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:24,800
是吗
Can't I?

8
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,990
但是她在让这世界上唯一的合成人
She has the world's only vibranium synthezoid

9
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:29,140
跟她演《郊区版老爸最知道》
playing Father-Knows-Best-In-Suburbia.

10
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,480
等他知道真相后会怎么样
What happens when he learns the truth?

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,600
你劫持了整个镇的人
You've taken an entire town hostage.

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,350
拿着枪的人可不是我  局长
Well, I'm not the one with the guns, Director.

13
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,910
我曾经也有一个哥哥
I had a brother.

14
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,120
他叫皮特
His name was Pietro.

15
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,340
他是被奥创杀死的
He was killed by Ultron.

16
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,170
一位消失很久的哥哥
Long lost bro get to

17
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,690
来给他的臭妹妹一个紧紧的拥抱了
squeeze his stinkin' sister to death or what?

18
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,020
她给皮特重新选角了
She recast Pietro?

六
集

42
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,760
万圣节是个神奇的节日
Halloween's a magical holiday.

43
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,680
它的重点是家庭  朋友
All about family, friends,

44
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,160
和可以扮成其他人一天的兴奋感
and the thrill of getting to be someone else for a day.

45
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,050
错了  万圣节的重点是糖果
Wrong! Halloween's about candy.

46
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,480
还有吓唬人  但糖果更重要
And scaring people, but mostly candy.

47
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,290
你的服装呢  汤米
Where's your costume, Tommy?

48
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,320
这就是我的服装  我是双胞胎里酷的那个
This is my costume. I'm the cool twin.

49
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,050
那我是什么
What does that make me?

50
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,940
呆呆龙
A dorksaurus rex.

51
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,810
没有那种恐龙
Not a real dinosaur.

52
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,390
天啊
Man.

53
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,130
他打鼾都那么酷
He even snores cool.

54
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,860
-我要吵醒他  -别
- I'm gonna go wake him up. - Don't!

55
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,380
你怕了吗
You scared?

56
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,400
他是我们的舅舅  我怎么会怕
He's our uncle. Why would I be scared?

57
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,130
因爲现在是下午四点
'Cause it's four o'clock in the afternoon.

58
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,540
你偷偷担心他是个吸血鬼
You're secretly afraid he's a vampire.

59
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,020
-我没有  -你就有
- No, I'm not. - Yes, you are.

60
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,180
我没有
No, I'm not.

61
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,650
血浓于水  我给你们看吧
Blood is thicker than water! I show you!

62
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:34,190
最好是有人流血  摔坏或者着火了
Somebody better be bleeding, broken, or on fire.

63
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:37,880
妈妈  你是老红帽吗
Mom. Are you old Red Riding Hood?

64
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,670
我是一名索科威亚算命师
I'm a Sokovian fortune teller.

65
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,490
那真是太...
That is so...

66
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,950
-酷了  -蠢了
- Rad. - ...lame.

67
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,050
是"蠢"
"Lame."

68
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,550
比我们得伤寒那年妈妈给我们做的服装还难看
Worse than the costumes mom made us the year we got typhus.

69
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,520

71
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,300
我印象里可不是那样
That's not exactly how I remember it.

72
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,480
你可能压抑了很多创伤
You probably suppressed a lot of the trauma.

73
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,210
皮特舅舅来后  妈妈就一直怪怪的
Mom has been weird since Uncle Pietro got here.

74
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,810
我觉得是因爲她好久没见他了
I think it's because she hasn't seen him in a long time.

75
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,260
而且他就是所谓的"大男孩"
And he's what you call, "A man child."

76
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,940
好服装啊  妹夫
Sweet costume bro-ham-in-law.

77
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,310
我猜猜  交通灯
Let me guess. Uh, traffic light.

78

剥了一半的玉米
Half-shucked corn.

79
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,450
鼻屎
A booger!

80
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,270

谢谢你迁就我
Well, thank you for humoring me

82
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,300
穿得这么滑稽  亲爱的
and wearing this ridiculous get-up, honey.

83
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,160
我的衣橱里没有其他衣服了  所以
Well, there were no other clothes in my closet, so...

84
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,680
你真不可救药  亲爱的
You are incorrigible, darling.

85
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,000
我知道你偷偷喜欢墨西哥摔跤手
I know you have a secret thing for Mexican wrestlers.

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,090
我好喜欢
Mi gusta mucho.

Chili con carne.

88
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:49,710
怎么样  孩子们
What do you say, boys?

89
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:53,080
谁准备好吃第一口高果糖玉米糖浆了
Who's ready for that first hit of high fructose corn syrup?

90
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,430
-锁头了  -快走开
- Yes! Headlock! - Get out of here, get out of here.

91
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,920
你没怎么跟我讲过你哥哥
Never told me much about your brother.

92
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,810
没想到他这么...
I had no idea he'd be so...

93
00:04:58,810 --> 00:04:59,930

96
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,660
那你今晚开心了  亲爱的
Well, you have fun tonight, darling.

97
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,080
什么  什么意思  你不都穿好要走了吗
What? What do you mean? You're all dressed and ready to go.

98
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,790
我在卧底
I'm undercover.

99
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:19,790
万圣节是爱惹事的青少年的狂欢盛典
Halloween is a bacchanal for adolescent trouble-makers

100
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,630

你可没说你有安排了
You didn't tell me you had plans.

105
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,360
我现在说了
Well, I am telling you now.

106
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:38,410
妈妈和爸爸近来  也不是吵架  就不一样了
Mom and Dad have been, not fighting, just, like, different.

107

119
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,260
你把水气球都放哪了
Where do you keep your water balloons?

120
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,050
什么  我们没有水气球
What? We don't have water balloons.

121
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,930
那这些剃须膏要往哪里放
Where are we gonna put all this shaving cream?

122
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,850
-是比利的主意  -我是汤米
- It was Billy's idea. - I'm Tommy.

123
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,360
你可别忘了
And don't you forget it!

124
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,760
你连服装都没有
You don't even have a costume.

125
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:45,330
好吧  但...记住  我们可是受尊敬的一家
Okay, but... Just remember that this is a respectable family.

126
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,680
如果我看到你们搞怪
If I see any funny business,

127
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,530
我就用魔法把你们变成腌鲱鱼
I am going to magic you into a pickled herring.

128
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,450
一小时内完成完全分析
I wanna see a full work-up inside the hour.

129
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:09,920
-是  长官  -海沃德
- Yes, sir. - Hayward.

130
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,430
海沃德
Hayward!

131
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,070
你派导弹进去  是断了我们的后路
You cut us off at the knees, sending in that missile.

132
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,360
我们现在清楚在跟什么样的人打交道了
Now we know who we're dealing with.

133
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,320
他来了
Hey, there he is.

134
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,480
差点被自己的杀人小队杀掉的人
The guy who almost got murdered by his own murder squad.

135
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,750
你爲我工作吗
You work for me?

136
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,320
-我还真不知道  -她是我的人
- I actually don't know. - She's with me.

137
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,100
这样啊  你们哪个是嘴上不饶人的闺蜜
I see. And which one of you is the sassy best friend?

138
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,710
你没功夫贬低同事了
There is no time for you to diminish your colleagues

139
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,760
你就要掀起一场你赢不了的战争了
when you're about to start a war you can't win.

140
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,810
马克西莫夫本就不可能跟我们谈判
Maximoff was never gonna negotiate with us.

141
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,100
我们干掉她  这整个噩梦才会结束
We take her out, this whole nightmare ends.

142
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,410
这不好说
We don't know that.

143
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,420
我们根本不知道
We actually have no idea

144
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:48,180
如果旺达死了  那里和这里都会发生什么
what will happen in there or out here if Wanda dies.

145
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,380
怎么  我们就对它投降吗
So, what? We just surrender to that?

146
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,600
绝不可能
Not happening.

147
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,310
我们打不过她
We can't outgun her.

148
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:57,880
显然  跟她对立只让事情更糟了
And clearly antagonizing her is only making things worse.

149
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,900
如果旺达是问题所在  那解铃还须系铃人
If Wanda is the problem, she has to be our solution.

150
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,250
兰博上尉  你已经成了此次任务的阻碍
Captain Rambeau, you have become an impediment to this mission.

151
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:10,130
总是替超能力人士说话
Constantly advocating on behalf of super-powered individuals.

152
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:13,300
是啊  我清楚你跟卡罗尔·丹弗斯的渊源
Yes, I know your history with Carol Danvers.

153
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,430
你们那些离开的人
You know, you people who left,

154
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,930
仍可以奢侈地保持乐观
still have the luxury of optimism.

155
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,130
你根本无法想象我们的情况
You have no idea what it was like.

156
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,800
爲了持续下去都需要付出什么
What it took to keep the lights on.

157
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:28,470
别拿过去五年作爲懦弱的藉口
Don't use the last five years as an excuse to be a coward.

158
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,250
或许你母亲死时你没在也是好事
Maybe it's a good thing you weren't here when your mother died.

159
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,570
因爲你显然没有做这份工作的勇气
Because clearly you don't have the stomach for this job.

160
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:45,450
带她离开我的基地  马上  把他们都带走
Get her off my base. Now. All of 'em.

161
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,830
好了  走吧
All right. Come on. Let's go.

162
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,110
海沃德的行事已经远超了他的临时权力
Hayward is way overstepping his provisional authority.

163
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,480
他就想找个理由排挤走我们
He was looking for a reason to sideline us.

164
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,710
他有什么计划
He's up to something.

165
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,570
走  都进去
Let's go. Everybody in!

166
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,860
怎么没人把计划告诉我
Why didn't anyone tell me the plan?

167
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,670
-你没事吧  -嗯  走吧
- You okay? - Yeah. Let's move.

You're testing me.

No, I'm not.

Hey, it's cool. I know I look different.

181
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:05,490
你爲什么...变样了
Why do you... look different?

182

你说呢  如果我找到了仙境
You tell me. I mean, if I found Shangri-La,

这是旺达吗

most personalities aren't far off from what's underneath,

382
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,570
人们的工作都更好
people got better jobs,

383
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,620
毫无疑问  发型也更棒
better haircuts, for sure.

384
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,700
你不觉得这是错的
You don't think it's wrong?

385
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:32,960
什么  你在开玩笑吗
What, are you kidding?

386
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,250
说真的  我感觉很震撼
I'm impressed! Seriously.

387
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,880
从给人们带来噩梦和从手里发射红色法术
It's a big leap from giving people nightmares

388
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,160
到变成这样  可是一个很大的飞跃呢
and shooting red wiggly-woos out of your hands.

389
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:44,160
你到底是怎么做到这些的
How'd you even do all this?

390
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:50,260
我不是什么陌生人
Hey, I'm not some stranger

391
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,780
我也不是你的丈夫
and I'm not your husband.

392
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,550
你可以和我聊聊
You can talk to me.

393
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,270
我不知道我是怎么做到的
I don't know how I did it.

I...

395
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:15,980
我只记得我感觉非常孤独
I only remember feeling completely alone.

396
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,620
非常空虚  我只是
Empty. I just...

397
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:24,900
永无止境的虚无
Endless nothingness.

398
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,320
你还好吗
Are you okay?

399
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,050
我没事
I'm fine.
