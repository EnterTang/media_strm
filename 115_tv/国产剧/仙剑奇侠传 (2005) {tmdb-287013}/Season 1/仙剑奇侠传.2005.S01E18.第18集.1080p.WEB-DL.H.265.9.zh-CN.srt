为了让我接受更好的教育
It had been a year since my mother sent me

00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:09,210
老妈把我送到Corleone中学读了一年了
to Corleone Junior High for a better education.

噢 我正在接受更好的教育 没错
Oh, I was getting a better education, all right.

5
00:00:13,307 --> 00:00:15,092
苦难教育
An education in misery.

6
00:00:17,819 --> 00:00:19,263

00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:27,872
我不知道!
I don't know!

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,652
我拼命想睡一会
I still struggled to get sleep.

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,482
- 安 妈妈 - 晚安 宝贝

Chris赶紧起床! 是时候要上学了
Chris, get your butt up! It's time to go to school.

13
00:00:36,313 --> 00:00:38,367
最糟糕的是 人人都讨厌我

00:00:45,163 --> 00:00:48,767
在Corleone唯一的好事就是遇见Greg

18
00:00:48,803 --> 00:00:50,435
嘿 想去打电动吗?
Hey, you want to go over to the arcade?

19
00:00:50,436 --> 00:00:52,679
- 他们有了炸弹人 - 我不喜欢那里
- They've got Ms. Pacman. - I don't like it over there.

20
00:00:52,715 --> 00:00:54,601
嗨 你是Chris 对吗?

是 干嘛?
Yeah, why?

22
00:00:56,546 --> 00:00:59,046
我只是想让你知道
I just wanted to let you know I think it's pretty lame

23
00:00:59,047 --> 00:01:00,748
人人都那样对你真的很过分
how everybody's been treating you.

24
00:01:00,749 --> 00:01:02,662
对以前我啥也没说而抱歉
Sorry I didn't say anything before now.

25
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:04,388
没关系 谢谢
That's all right. Thanks.

26
00:01:04,436 --> 00:01:07,488
嘿 我要去电动室和朋友们会合玩炸弹人
Hey, I'm meeting some friends over at the arcade to play some Ms. Pacman.

28
00:01:08,396 --> 00:01:10,399

30
00:01:12,516 --> 00:01:13,516

You can come, too.

31
00:01:13,727 --> 00:01:16,031
最终还是有人眷顾了我
Finally someone was being nice to me.

32
00:01:18,099 --> 00:01:19,881
我会在炸弹人里虐你
I'm going to beat your butt in Ms. Pacman.

33
00:01:19,907 --> 00:01:21,270

Oh, we'll see about that.

34
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,709
惊喜 小金刚
Surprise, Donkey Kong.

35
00:01:23,787 --> 00:01:25,787
我就知道没有那么便宜的事
I knew it was too good to be true.

36
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,904
- Greg! - 快跑 你这小笨蛋
- Greg! - Run away, you little idiot.

37
00:01:28,996 --> 00:01:29,996
扁他!

38
00:01:30,352 --> 00:01:31,808
尝尝这个 你这小阿飞

你知道吗?
You know what?

42

46
00:02:23,661 --> 00:02:25,552
天哪 发生什么事了?
Oh, my God. What happened to you?

47
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:27,835
妈妈 我再也不想回那学校了
Mom, I am not going back to that school.

48
00:02:27,963 --> 00:02:30,132
好吧 等等 怎么回事?
All right, now, wait a minute. What's going on?

49
00:02:30,724 --> 00:02:31,724
我讨厌Corleone
I hate Corleone.

50
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:33,684
我不合群 没人喜欢我
I don't fit in. Nobody likes me.

51
00:02:33,832 --> 00:02:34,832
经常累的半死
I'm always tired,

52
00:02:34,883 --> 00:02:36,803
几乎每天都有人来作弄我
and almost every day somebody is picking on me.

53
00:02:36,804 --> 00:02:39,803
Chris 你不能因此而放弃接受良好教育
Chris, you cannot let that stop you from getting a good education.

54
00:02:39,804 --> 00:02:42,310
我们又不是送你去讨人喜欢的 宝贝
We didn't send you over there to be liked, baby.

55
00:02:42,311 --> 00:02:43,278
说的对
Got that right.

56
00:02:43,301 --> 00:02:46,089
妈妈 我在那唯一学到的就是逃跑
Mom, the only thing I'm learning over there is how to get jumped on.

57
00:02:46,128 --> 00:02:48,214
我怎么就不能去桑福德中学呢?
How come I can't go to Lamont Sanford Junior High?

58
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,023
- 就隔几个街区而已 - 不行
- It's only a few blocks away. - Mm-mm, no.

59
00:02:50,058 --> 00:02:52,256
你不能去这附近的学校
You are not going to school in this neighborhood.

60
00:02:52,303 --> 00:02:55,862
你还记得去年有个女孩在玛拉吉中学被人捅了一刀吗?
You remember that girl that got stabbed last year at Marla Gibbs High School?

61
00:02:55,863 --> 00:02:59,484
Chris 桑福德里都是痞子小青年和少年犯
Chris, Sanford has nothing but juvenile delinquents and future convicts.

62
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:03,454
一个人把我出卖给便衣而被判了10年
A man just got ten years because he sold me to an undercover cop.

63
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:04,424
那么我是?
What am I?

64
00:03:04,535 --> 00:03:07,012
大麻 可卡因 海洛英 还是快克?
Weed, cocaine, heroin or crack?

65
00:03:07,536 --> 00:03:08,787
- Rachel - 是快克
- Rachel. - Crack.

66
00:03:10,143 --> 00:03:11,800
- 但是妈妈 - 但是没用 Chris
- But Mom... - But nothing, Chris.

67
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:15,152
还有你是怎么弄的满身油漆?
And how did you get paint all over you, anyway?

68
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,098
我去店里玩炸弹人
I went to the store to go play Ms. Pacman.

69
00:03:17,227 --> 00:03:19,199
啊哈! 瞧见没?
Aha! Ah! See there?

70
00:03:19,377 --> 00:03:21,556
要是你一开始就不去那里
See, now, had you not been there in the first place,

71
00:03:21,557 --> 00:03:22,907
你就不会搞的一团糟
you wouldn't be in this mess.

72
00:03:22,908 --> 00:03:25,741
我不断的讲 家和学校两点一线
I keep telling you, come straight home from school.

73
00:03:26,113 --> 00:03:27,779
或许你现在该听我的话了
Maybe now you'll listen to me.

74
00:03:28,017 --> 00:03:30,469
听着 我知道你不喜欢去Corleone
Look, I know you don't like going to Corleone.

75
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,803
但是万事多磨难
But everything is not supposed to be easy.

76
00:03:33,122 --> 00:03:34,122
你明白吗?
You understand me?

77
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,943
上楼去把衣服脱了吧
Now, go upstairs and get out of those clothes.

78
00:03:38,944 --> 00:03:39,944
是的 妈妈
Yes, ma'am.

79
00:03:42,339 --> 00:03:44,435
他咋了 看起来像个湿嗒嗒的小丑
What happened to him? He looks like a wet mime.

80
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,790
没事 他在学校出了点意外
Nothing, he got in an accident at school.

81
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:50,224
我妈从来不愿意告诉爸爸坏消息
My mother never liked to bother my father with bad news.

82
00:03:50,225 --> 00:03:52,280
像上次Tonya被公车给撞了
Like the time Tonya got hit by a bus.

83
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,082
Tonya怎么了?
What happened to Tonya?

84
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,083
没事
Nothing.

85
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:58,510
还有次Drew的腿给截了
Or the time Drew got his legs cut off.

86
00:03:58,557 --> 00:04:00,327
- Drew怎么了? - 没啥
- What happened to Drew? - Nothing.

87
00:04:04,213 --> 00:04:05,611
你在乐呵个啥?
What are you so happy about?

88
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:08,113
你记得我去应聘鱼市场的工作吗?
You know that job I applied for down at the fish market?

89
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:09,453
- 嗯 - 我被聘了!
- Yeah. - I got it!

90
00:04:09,535 --> 00:04:11,027
噢 宝贝 真棒!
Oh, baby, that's great!

91
00:04:11,535 --> 00:04:12,669
恭喜啊
Congratulations.

92
00:04:12,873 --> 00:04:13,873
嗯
Yeah.

93
00:04:14,025 --> 00:04:16,326
比俺两份工资加起来还付的多
It pays more than my other two jobs combined.

94
00:04:16,365 --> 00:04:18,024
真棒! 我要去逛街!
That's great! I get to shop!

95
00:04:20,422 --> 00:04:24,496
这些年头一回我只需要打一份工
Man, for the first time in years I only have to work one job.

96
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:26,867
而且我只要白天工作
And I'll be working during the day.

97
00:04:26,868 --> 00:04:28,335
感觉像是退休一样
It's going to feel like retirement.

98
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:30,136
也就是说我们每天放学后
So does this mean we don't have to be quiet

99
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:31,887
就不用保持安静啦?
every day when we come home from school?

100
00:04:31,888 --> 00:04:34,554
6点前 想怎么大声就怎么大声
You can make all the noise you want, until 6:00.

101
00:04:35,147 --> 00:04:38,424
嘿 爸爸 我们可以开始在超市买些名牌吗?
Hey, Dad, can we start buying name brands at the store now?

102
00:04:39,448 --> 00:04:41,219
- 仅限奥利奥 - 真酷
- Just Oreos. - That's cool.

103
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:42,513
我们需要庆祝下
We  need to celebrate.

104
00:04:42,607 --> 00:04:44,662
做些我们未曾做过的
Do something we've never done before.

105
00:04:44,863 --> 00:04:46,917
意思是去看场电影后
That can mean anything from going to the movies

106
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:48,918
接着手拉着手回客厅
to holding hands in the living room.

107
00:04:49,613 --> 00:04:51,592
嗨 爸爸 我们能去玩大逃亡吗?
Hey, Dad. Can we go to Great Escape?

108
00:04:51,627 --> 00:04:52,716
游乐场?
The amusement park?

109
00:04:52,772 --> 00:04:54,311
嗯 能去吗? 拜托啦
Yeah,  can we go? Please?

110
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:56,587
好吧 宝贝
Sure, baby.

111
00:04:56,787 --> 00:04:57,787
真棒!
Yes!

112
00:04:57,788 --> 00:04:58,899
我去告诉Chris
I got to tell Chris.

113
00:04:59,102 --> 00:05:01,740
既然我妈妈不准我离开Corleone
Since my mother wouldn't let me leave Corleone,

114
00:05:01,827 --> 00:05:03,463
我不得不疯狂的策划下
I had to take drastic measures.

115
00:05:03,758 --> 00:05:05,980
你想让你自己被踢出去?
You're going to get yourself kicked out?

116
00:05:06,207 --> 00:05:07,256
我不得不离开这儿
I have to get out of here.

117
00:05:07,257 --> 00:05:08,812
还有别的选择吗?
What other choice do I have?

118
00:05:09,317 --> 00:05:10,317
不知道
I don't know.

119
00:05:10,516 --> 00:05:12,516
我只是有点舍不得你离开
I guess I just don't want you to go.

120
00:05:12,668 --> 00:05:14,117
你把我一人丢在这儿
You leave me here by myself...

121
00:05:14,118 --> 00:05:15,118
我就完了
I'm toast.

122
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:16,326
你会没事的
You'll be all right.

123
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:19,214
他们唯一来找你麻烦的理由 就是因为你跟我在屁股后面
The only reason why they mess with you is 'cause you hang out with me.

124
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:20,310
你会找交些新朋友啊
You'll find new friends.

125
00:05:20,327 --> 00:05:21,549
但是我们小团队 哥们
But we're a team, man.

126
00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:23,386
我们就像是《警界双雄》里得Starsky和Hutch
We're like Starsky and Hutch.

127
00:05:23,387 --> 00:05:24,387
Hall和Oates (一白一黑二重唱组合)
Hall and Oates.

128
00:05:24,448 --> 00:05:25,756
就像Itchy和Blacky
Like Itchy and Blacky.

129
00:05:26,188 --> 00:05:27,465
我们还是朋友啊
We'll still be friends.

130
00:05:27,615 --> 00:05:29,632
我只是在另个不同得学校里
I'll just be at a different school.

131
00:05:29,737 --> 00:05:32,348
那么你觉得在另个学校会有不同吗?
So you think it's going to be different at the other school?

132
00:05:32,349 --> 00:05:33,349
当然
Yeah.

133
00:05:33,747 --> 00:05:34,928
真的不同
Real different.

134
00:05:35,758 --> 00:05:36,845
嗨 你叫什么名字 小孩?
Hey, what's your name, kid?

135
00:05:36,846 --> 00:05:38,256
- Chris - 你什么星座?
- Chris. - What's your sign?

136
00:05:38,257 --> 00:05:39,106
双子
Gemini.

137
00:05:39,107 --> 00:05:41,706
好吧 某个小酷猫在海上绕世界航行
All right. This cool cat sailed around the world

138
00:05:41,707 --> 00:05:43,873
同船的还有Pinta和Santa Maria
on the Nia, Pinta and the Santa Maria.

139
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:46,626
如果你能拼出他的名字
I will give you a year's supply of Black Fro Sheen

140
00:05:46,627 --> 00:05:48,349
我就给你提供1年的非洲黑人发型
if you can unscramble his name.

141
00:06:00,266 --> 00:06:02,058
那么你是认真的?
So you're serious about this?

142
00:06:02,098 --> 00:06:03,098
嗨 小侏儒
Hey, pygmy.

143
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:06,657
干啥?
What?

144
00:06:06,757 --> 00:06:07,757
我是认真的
I'm serious.

145
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,742
我得离开这里
I got to get out of here.

146
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,423
妈妈 当我么去玩大逃亡得时候
Mama, when we go to the Great Escape,

147
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:14,677
我们可以骑"西部疯牛"吗?
can we get on the Neck Snapper?

148
00:06:14,679 --> 00:06:16,828
不行 但是当你一坐上去
No, and if you get on the Neck Snapper,

149
00:06:16,829 --> 00:06:19,697
接下来骑的时候 你会成为屁股胜利者
the next ride you'll be on will be the Butt Whupper.

150
00:06:19,698 --> 00:06:21,390
而且Tonya你太小了
Besides, Tonya, you're too little.

151
00:06:21,425 --> 00:06:23,124
Chris和我都才骑了两次
Chris and I are riding it twice.

152
00:06:27,489 --> 00:06:29,227
仅仅在工作一天之后
After just one day on the job,

153
00:06:29,274 --> 00:06:32,177
我爸带给家的不仅仅是更多的钱
my father was bringing home more than just a bigger paycheck.

154
00:06:32,178 --> 00:06:33,178
天哪 那是什么?
God, what is that?

155
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:34,796
嗨 大家
Hey, everybody.

156
00:06:36,347 --> 00:06:37,516
噢 天哪
Oh, my God.

157
00:06:37,645 --> 00:06:38,346
Julius!
Julius!

158
00:06:38,347 --> 00:06:41,569
你卖了鱼还是和鱼美人睡过?
What? Are you selling the fish or sleeping with a mermaid?

159
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:42,618
怎么了?
What's wrong?

160
00:06:42,657 --> 00:06:44,583
噢 Drew 去把窗户打开
Oh, Drew, go open up the windows.

161
00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:46,502
快点 Tonya 去拿风扇
Hurry up, Tonya, go get the fans.

162
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,929
待会再给你做饭
I'll bring y'all dinner up to y'all later.

163
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,882
什么时候他们在自己房间吃饭了?
Since when do they get to eat in their room?

164
00:06:51,105 --> 00:06:53,150
从你开始倒人胃口起
Since you turn people's stomachs.

165
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:54,789
你闻起来就像
You smell like...

166
00:06:54,988 --> 00:06:57,086
馊掉的奶酪
pierced ears and cheese.

167
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:01,620
你不会每天都带着这臭味回家吧?
Are you going to come home smelling like this every day?

168
00:07:02,269 --> 00:07:03,791
天哪!
My God!

169
00:07:04,921 --> 00:07:06,476
不知道 但是我如果要这样
I don't know, but I if I do,

170
00:07:06,753 --> 00:07:08,549
你们就习惯下吧
y'all just going to have to get used to it.

171
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,034
这份工作有非常多的补贴
This job has too many perks.

172
00:07:12,027 --> 00:07:13,518
我该在怎么办啊?
What am I going to do with that?

173
00:07:13,579 --> 00:07:17,046
你得带着你的小朋友上楼 然后给它洗澡
No, you need to take your little friend upstairs and put him in the shower.

174
00:07:17,082 --> 00:07:19,475
要是它闻起来和你一样 我可不会烧它
'Cause if he smells anything like you, I ain't cooking him,

175
00:07:19,511 --> 00:07:21,226
还有我肯定不会吃它
and I damn sure ain't eating him.

176
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:24,179
- 宝贝 - 走! 赶紧走!
- Baby. - Go! Just go!

177
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:27,725
你闻起来就像臭咖喱味的长统袜
You smell like curried tube socks.

178
00:07:30,697 --> 00:07:31,960
赶紧走!
Just go!

179
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:36,931
第二天我实施我的踢出学校计划
The next day I set my plan to get kicked out of school into action.

180
00:07:37,494 --> 00:07:40,359
Chris 应该是"H-E-R-E"
Chris, it's "H-E-R-E."

181
00:07:40,604 --> 00:07:41,508
好好学习!
Study!

182
00:07:41,543 --> 00:07:43,253
我从来都不会拼对
I never could spell.

183
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,174
不管啥艰难险阻
Come hell or high water,

184
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:48,858
我都一定要被赶出学校
I was getting kicked out of school.

185
00:07:48,859 --> 00:07:49,859
噢! 谢谢你
Oh! Thank you.

186
00:07:50,809 --> 00:07:51,809
谢谢你
Thank you.

187
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:56,314
再待这30秒得话 我们就比你还黑了
Another 30 seconds in there we would have been blacker than you.

188
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:00,707
我宣誓对国旗效忠...
I pledge allegiance to the flag...

189
00:08:00,719 --> 00:08:02,274
这次有效了是吧?
This has got to work, right?

190
00:08:02,353 --> 00:08:04,467
还有对美利坚合众国
...and to the republic for which it stands.

191
00:08:04,514 --> 00:08:06,076
- 错! - 一个国家
- Wrong! - One nation...

192
00:08:06,123 --> 00:08:08,184
真不敢相信这都不奏效
I couldn't believe that didn't work.

193
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,807
在做了几天少年惯犯后
After a few days of being a full-time juvenile delinquent,

194
00:08:11,808 --> 00:08:14,183
我已经没辙了 仍然待在学校
I was out of ideas and still in school.

195
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:16,813
我放弃了 我再也不会离开这鬼地方了
I give up. I'm never getting out of here.

196
00:08:16,814 --> 00:08:17,717
别这样 哥们
Come on, man.

197
00:08:17,718 --> 00:08:18,717
这也不坏啊
It's not so bad.

198
00:08:18,718 --> 00:08:19,718
再过段时间
Give  it some time.

199
00:08:19,776 --> 00:08:20,774
事情会改变的
Things will change.

200
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:23,596
嘿 小熏肉 想去电动室吗?
Hey, bacon bit, want to go to the arcade?

201
00:08:25,406 --> 00:08:26,973
我再不能忍受了!
I can't take this anymore!

202
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:36,870
耶!
Yes!

203
00:08:39,434 --> 00:08:41,219
一本书砸到了我的挡风玻璃!
A book hit my windshield!

204
00:08:41,266 --> 00:08:44,237
好吧 好消息是 我被踢出Corleone学校了
Well,  the good news is, I'm getting kicked out of Corleone.

205
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:46,747
坏消息是 我进了监狱!
The bad news is, I'm going to jail!

206
00:08:55,384 --> 00:08:57,706
我这么费尽的设法被踢出学校
I was so busy trying to get kicked out of school,

207
00:08:57,707 --> 00:09:01,077
没想到我也许活不到转校那天了
it never occured to me that I might not live long enough to transfer.

208
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:03,409
好吧 非常感谢
Okay, thank you very much.

209
00:09:07,638 --> 00:09:08,638
你被退学了?
You got suspended?

210
00:09:09,637 --> 00:09:10,692
只是场意外
It was an accident.

211
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,896
好吧 那么你是怎么意外的有了场意外?
Well, how can you accidentally have an accident?

212
00:09:12,931 --> 00:09:15,691
一些孩子来找我的茬 所以我就拿我的书砸他
Some kid was messing with me, so I tried to hit him with my book.

213
00:09:15,726 --> 00:09:18,320
Chris 如果你是读书而不是扔书的话
Chris, if you were reading the book instead of throwing the book,

214
00:09:18,356 --> 00:09:20,682
也许他们就没空来找你的茬
maybe people wouldn't have time to mess with you.

215
00:09:20,683 --> 00:09:22,536
他们总是抽时间来找我的茬
They always find time to mess with me.

216
00:09:22,537 --> 00:09:24,148
我啥也甭想听了
I don't even want to hear it.

217
00:09:24,184 --> 00:09:26,292
你也别想就躺在这儿
And don't think you just gonna be laying around here

218
00:09:26,327 --> 00:09:27,783
看骑士骑术一整天 明白吗?
watching Knight Rider all day, okay?

219
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:30,393
你得在这儿做事 你得做家务
You're gonna be here working, you're gonna have chores.

220
00:09:30,394 --> 00:09:31,295
你知道吗?
You know what?

221
00:09:31,296 --> 00:09:33,987
上楼回你房间 然后等着你爸爸回来
Just go upstairs in your room and wait for your father to get here.

222
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:34,851
在我家
In our house,

223
00:09:34,886 --> 00:09:37,557
"等你爸爸" 意思是会被给爆抽一顿
"Wait for your father" meant I was getting a whupping.

224
00:09:37,558 --> 00:09:40,002
我爸爸对他的抽非常认真
My father took his whuppings very seriously.

225
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,301
他为每种错误都准备了皮带
He had a belt for every infraction.

226
00:09:42,511 --> 00:09:43,899
这是"谎之皮带"
There was the Lying Belt,

227
00:09:44,315 --> 00:09:45,926
这是"偷之皮带"
there was the Stealing Belt,

228
00:09:46,066 --> 00:09:47,621
这是"又骗又偷皮带"
the Lying and Stealing Belt,

229
00:09:48,431 --> 00:09:50,153
让某人怀孕的皮带
the Got Somebody Pregnant Belt.

230
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:53,351
最衰的是"吸毒皮带"
And the worst was the Doing Drugs Belt.

231
00:09:54,217 --> 00:09:56,225
在我准备好受罚的时候
While I was getting ready for my punishment,

232
00:09:56,332 --> 00:09:58,594
我妈也为我爸爸准备好了
my mother was getting ready for my father.

233
00:09:58,595 --> 00:10:00,483
他如果以为他能走进这栋房子
He's crazy if he think he gonna...

234
00:10:01,445 --> 00:10:06,149
闻起来像42街一样 那他就疯了
be... coming up in this house smelling it up like 42nd Street.

235
00:10:06,255 --> 00:10:07,255
噢 不 不 不
Oh, no, no, no.

236
00:10:07,505 --> 00:10:10,727
附近的邻居不会谈论我的
People in this neighborhood ain't gonna talk about... me.

237
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:19,958
Rochelle
Rochelle...

238
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:21,610
你在干嘛?
what you doing?

239
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:24,433
你的制服把整个屋子都熏臭了
Uniform was stinking up the whole house.

240
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,221
我都清理一整天了
I been cleaning up all day,

241
00:10:26,222 --> 00:10:28,277
设法把这臭味给弄出去
trying to get that smell out of here.

242
00:10:28,403 --> 00:10:29,333
但是这都是些啥?
But what's all this?

243
00:10:29,334 --> 00:10:31,167
都是值16块大洋的保鲜膜啊
That's $16 worth of plastic wrap.

244
00:10:31,229 --> 00:10:33,042
这是保护我家具的膜
This plastic is protecting my furniture.

245
00:10:33,043 --> 00:10:35,376
到处都弥漫着鱼腥味
That fish smell was saturating everything.

246
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:40,273
噢 宝贝 你买了食品回来?
Oh, baby, you bought groceries?

247
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:43,309
我都还为你买了乌龟糖
I even got you the Turtles.

248
00:10:44,469 --> 00:10:45,469
谢谢 宝贝
Thank you, baby.

249
00:10:45,963 --> 00:10:49,184
嗷 嗷  乌龟糖 嗯!
Ooh, ooh, Turtles. Mmm!

250
00:10:53,893 --> 00:10:56,898
这些乌龟糖吃起来像是海龟糖
These Turtles taste like... turtle.

251
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,099
我可不吃这些
I can't eat these.

252
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,699
好吧 那什么都别吃了
Fine. Don't eat any of 'em.

253
00:11:00,408 --> 00:11:01,700
可那我有啥吃的?
But do I get something to eat?

254
00:11:01,701 --> 00:11:02,651
不! 不!
No! No!

255
00:11:02,652 --> 00:11:04,096
在你洗完澡之前没有
Not until you take a bath.

256
00:11:04,109 --> 00:11:06,259
我可不想你熏坏我的保鲜膜
I do not want you smelling up my plastic.

257
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,037
接着 把你的衣服装进去
Here, put your clothes in there.

258
00:11:09,367 --> 00:11:12,369
噢 在你做之前 我需要你去和Chris谈谈
Oh, and before you do that, I-I need you to talk to Chris.

259
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,370
什么事?
What happened?

260
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,820
他被退学了
He got suspended.

261
00:11:15,018 --> 00:11:16,627
哦 不 我去让他尝尝我的鞭子
Oh, no. I'm gonna give him my belt...

262
00:11:16,628 --> 00:11:17,777
别 别 别 别
No, no, no, no, no, no.

263
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:20,222
这次 我真的需要你和他谈谈
This time, I really need you to talk to him.

264
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:21,281
好吗?
O kay?

265
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:24,233
好的
Okay.

266
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,789
我爸爸闻起来实在是太臭了
My father smelled so bad,

267
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:29,195
我都不知道他是要抽死我 还是要熏死我
I didn't know if he was gonna beat me or suffocate me.

268
00:11:29,196 --> 00:11:31,534
爸爸 在我们开始之前 你能把窗户打开吗?
Dad, before we start, can you open up a window?

269
00:11:31,581 --> 00:11:34,282
不 这就当成是对你惩法的一部分
No. Consider this part of your punishment.

270
00:11:34,948 --> 00:11:35,948
好吧
Okay.

271
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:39,919
说吧 儿子
Come on, man.

272
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:42,718
告诉我是咋会事
Tell me what's going on.

273
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,869
我恨那所学校 爸爸
I hate that school, Dad.

274
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,370
我恨那里的一切
I hate everything about it.

275
00:11:45,631 --> 00:11:48,075
我知道妈妈想让我有个好点的教育
I know Mom wants me to get a good education,

276
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,168
但是每天都变得更糟
but every day, it just gets worse.

277
00:11:50,496 --> 00:11:53,039
你不能因为不喜欢就放弃 Chris
You can't just quit something 'cause you don't like it, Chris.

278
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,984
但是妈妈总是放弃她的工作
But Mom quits her job all the time.

279
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,140
但是你是男子汉
But you're a man.

280
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,390
男子汉从不放弃
Men don't quit.

281
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:03,410
要是杰克・罗宾逊放弃了呢?
What if Jackie Robinson quit?

282
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:06,070
要是乔治・华盛顿放弃了呢?
What if George Washington Carver quit?

283
00:12:06,469 --> 00:12:08,469
要是马丁路德・金放弃了呢?
What if Martin Luther King Jr. quit?

284
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,718
每当我爸爸有个话题想说的时候
When my father had a point to make,

285
00:12:10,719 --> 00:12:13,845
他总是能起个虎头 结个蛇尾
he always started off strong, but he never ended that way.

286
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:16,140
要是桑德斯上校放弃了呢? (45分钟后)
What if Colonel Sanders quit?

287
00:12:16,628 --> 00:12:18,072
要是阿波罗放弃了呢?
What if Apollo Creed quit?

288
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,168
要是凯瑟琳・杰克逊放弃生孩子了呢?
What if Katherine Jackson quit making kids?

289
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,345
难道她不是女人?!
Ain't she a woman?!

290
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:24,216
他们可能就是杰克逊老三 (著名歌手迈克・杰克逊 家族排行老三)
They might be The Jackson Three.

291
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,567
要是Kool from Kool和the Gang放弃了呢?
What if Kool from Kool and the Gang quit?

292
00:12:27,894 --> 00:12:29,948
如果他们不叫The Gang
You think they would have gotten a record contract

293
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,601
你以为他们会得到唱片合同?
if they were just called The Gang?

294
00:12:31,602 --> 00:12:34,324
直到今日 我都不能描述我爸爸所讲
To this day, I can't tell you what my father said

295
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:36,470
但是那臭味让我终身难忘
but that smell stayed with me forever.

296
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:39,211
要是你放弃 你就是让他们赢
If you quit, you're letting them win.

297
00:12:39,609 --> 00:12:41,119
这不是关于赢还是输
It's not about winning or losing.

298
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,619
我只是想离开那学校
I just want to leave the school.

299
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,620
好吧
Okay, fine.

300
00:12:45,022 --> 00:12:48,744
让我和你妈妈谈谈把你换所学校
Let me talk to your mother about getting you in a different school.

301
00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:51,449
另个学校?!
Another school?!

302
00:12:52,235 --> 00:12:55,107
每当Chris不喜欢什么 你都宠着他
If you bail Chris out every time he doesn't like something,

303
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,908
也就是说每当他有问题 他都会跑来找你
that means he's gonna run to you every time he has a problem.

304
00:12:57,909 --> 00:13:00,024
也就是他怎么也学不会怎么做个男人
Which means he'll never learn how to be a man.

305
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:01,982
要是你不能教他怎么做个男人
And if you can't teach him how to be a man, that

306
00:13:01,983 --> 00:13:03,088
也就是说你不是个称职的父亲
means you're a bad father.

307
00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:04,164
要是你不是个称职的父亲
And if you're a bad father,

308
00:13:04,165 --> 00:13:05,688
也就是说我挑了个错的丈夫
that means I picked the wrong husband.

309
00:13:05,689 --> 00:13:08,197
要是你认为我会奔相走告的告诉这里的人
And if you think I'm about to let people run around here

310
00:13:08,198 --> 00:13:09,748
我可以嫁给任何人
talking about I just marry anybody,

311
00:13:09,749 --> 00:13:11,471
你一定是脑子秀逗了
you must be out your damn mind.

312
00:13:12,549 --> 00:13:13,349
听着
Look...

313
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,738
噢 等等 不 等等!
Oh, wait, wait, no, wait!

314
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:16,309
先把塑料膜铺好
Put the plastic down first.

315
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,419
谢谢
Thank you.

316
00:13:21,146 --> 00:13:23,075
听着 我知道你担心
Look, I know you're worried.

317
00:13:23,975 --> 00:13:26,197
但是Chris在Corleone过的不开心啊
But Chris is just not happy at Corleone.

318
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,668
不好意思 我只是觉得桑福德不适合他
I'm sorry. I just don't think Sanford is good enough for him.

319
00:13:31,214 --> 00:13:32,938
既然我有了新的工作
Well... now that I got this new job,

320
00:13:32,939 --> 00:13:35,772
也许我们可以供的起他上学了
maybe we can afford to pay for him to go to school.

321
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,656
我们至少可以先看看
We could at least look around.

322
00:13:38,908 --> 00:13:39,908
好吧
Okay, fine.

323
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,071
我们去找找其他的学校
We'll look for other schools.

324
00:13:43,018 --> 00:13:45,464
我们还要去找找其他的肥皂 你个臭人!
And we'll look for other soap. You stink!

325
00:13:47,676 --> 00:13:50,120
从那之后 我们试了表演艺术学校
From there, we tried performing arts school.

326
00:13:58,594 --> 00:13:59,544
下一个!
Next!

327
00:13:59,545 --> 00:14:01,156
我们去了犹太人学校
We looked into Hebrew school.

328
00:14:05,267 --> 00:14:06,242
下一个!
Next!

329
00:14:06,405 --> 00:14:07,793
我们甚至去了说唱学校
We even tried old school.

330
00:14:16,164 --> 00:14:17,462
- 下一个! - 啥?
- Next! - What...?

331
00:14:17,521 --> 00:14:20,184
打那之后 只剩一家可去了
After that, there was only one thing left to do.

332
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:22,673
我和你父亲讨论过了
Well, me and your father discussed it,

333
00:14:22,674 --> 00:14:26,285
如果你真的想去附近的学校 那就去吧
and if you really want to go to the neighborhood school, you can.

334
00:14:26,357 --> 00:14:27,389
真的?
For real?

335
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,667
是的 但是你得保证你的成绩上升
Yes, but you have to keep your grades up.

336
00:14:30,044 --> 00:14:31,044
不是A 就是B
A's and B's.

337
00:14:31,414 --> 00:14:33,304
如果你还想惹麻烦的话
And if you even think about getting in trouble,

338
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:36,971
我就会杀到那学校 然后一脚把你给废了
I  will march down to that school and knock the no-good out of you.

339
00:14:37,469 --> 00:14:39,511
我们去Corleone取你的证件
We'll go to Corleone and pick up your papers.

340
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:42,289
在你缓刑期满了后 下周就转过去
You can transfer next week, after your suspension.

341
00:14:42,366 --> 00:14:43,366
谢谢妈妈
Thanks, Ma.

342
00:14:43,447 --> 00:14:44,938
嗯 我爱你
All right. I love you.

343
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:49,387
我成功了 接下来是我想象的
I did this, but here's what I felt like.

344
00:14:50,135 --> 00:14:51,665
我离开这里了 笨蛋们!
I'm outta here, suckas!

345
00:14:55,206 --> 00:14:56,372
我感觉爆爽的时候
I was feeling great.

346
00:14:56,607 --> 00:14:57,995
与此同时 在大街上
Meanwhile, on the street,

347
00:14:58,009 --> 00:15:01,397
大伙见了我爸就像毒贩见了警察一样 落荒而逃
my father was clearing folks out like a cop in a crack house.

348
00:15:03,126 --> 00:15:04,366
真该死!
Something's dead!

349
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:12,539
妈妈 我不喜欢爸爸的新工作
Mama, I don't like Daddy's new job.

350
00:15:13,028 --> 00:15:14,028
他臭啊!
He stinks!

351
00:15:14,482 --> 00:15:16,736
是啊 不过他现在赚更多的钱了
Yeah, but he's making a lot more money now.

352
00:15:16,737 --> 00:15:18,399
那又怎样? 他太臭了
So? He stinks.

353
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,835
他做别的工作的时候可不臭
He didn't stink when he worked his other jobs.

354
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:24,707
宝贝 有了这份工作 他可以有更多的时间来赔我们
Well, baby, with this job, he gets to spend more time with us.

355
00:15:24,872 --> 00:15:26,128
更多的臭时间!
More stink time!

356
00:15:26,451 --> 00:15:27,624
噢 好了 Tonya!
Oh, come on, Tonya!

357
00:15:28,446 --> 00:15:29,501
没那么糟
It's not that ba...

358
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,776
你们都闻到了?!
Y'all smell that?!

359
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:34,933
嗯
Yeah.

360
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:37,423
该死 伙计! 你个臭人!
Damn, man! You stink!

361
00:15:42,272 --> 00:15:43,664
噢 天哪!
Oh, Lord! Oh!

362
00:15:53,295 --> 00:15:54,295
Rochelle?
Rochelle?

363
00:15:54,893 --> 00:15:55,893
Rochelle?!
Rochelle?!

364
00:15:56,494 --> 00:15:58,218
- 干啥?! - 让我进来
- What?! - Let me in.

365
00:15:58,254 --> 00:15:59,869
不 你的臭味
No. You smell.

366
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,513
那是一个工作人的气味
That's the smell of a working man.

367
00:16:01,514 --> 00:16:03,604
不 那是海王大章鱼的气味
No, that is the smell of Aquaman.

368
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:05,729
Rochelle 开门
Rochelle, open the door.

369
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:06,923
不
No.

370
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,124
听着 宝贝
Look, baby,

371
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:12,009
我知道这份工作给你带来了更多的时间和钱
I understand that this job brings you more free time and more money,

372
00:16:12,424 --> 00:16:14,252
但是我不能忍受的是
but I can't take it anymore.

373
00:16:14,693 --> 00:16:15,970
孩子们都难以呼吸了
The kids can't breathe.

374
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:17,676
晚上我也不能入睡
I cannot sleep at night.

375
00:16:17,774 --> 00:16:20,829
你不知道我每天都要去洗衣店吗?
Do you not know that I'm at that Laundromat every day?

376
00:16:20,882 --> 00:16:22,524
我烧了这么多的香
I've been burning so much incense,

377
00:16:22,595 --> 00:16:25,413
已经有十个人来我这买蚊香了
ten people came by here trying to buy reggae albums.

378
00:16:25,478 --> 00:16:26,478
嘿 mon!
Hey, mon!

379
00:16:26,788 --> 00:16:28,524
- 那你想让我怎样? - 放弃这份工作!
- What you want me to do? - Quit!

380
00:16:28,547 --> 00:16:29,622
我不能放弃!
I can't just quit!

381
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:32,414
这会给孩子们树立个啥样的榜样?
What kind of example would that be for the kids, huh?

382
00:16:32,415 --> 00:16:33,664
马歇尔放弃了吗?
Did Thurgood Marshall quit?

383
00:16:33,665 --> 00:16:35,014
道格拉斯放弃了吗?
Did Frederick Douglass quit?

384
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:36,561
华盛顿放弃了吗?
Did Booker T. Washington quit?

385
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,284
我不知道 我也不管
I don't know, and I don't care.

386
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,308
我所知道的就是 我想要你放弃
All I know is, I want you to quit.

387
00:16:40,443 --> 00:16:42,476
那带着孩子们去玩大逃亡怎样?
What about taking the kids to Great Escape, huh?

388
00:16:42,477 --> 00:16:44,114
和你在一起 我们哪儿都不想去
We don't want to go nowhere with you.

389
00:16:44,138 --> 00:16:45,570
是的 爸爸 你个臭男人
Yeah, Daddy, you stink.

390
00:16:48,484 --> 00:16:50,109
- 这是啥? - 干净的衣服
- What's this? - Clean clothes.

391
00:16:50,185 --> 00:16:51,851
我该在哪里换?
Where am I supposed to change?

392
00:16:52,185 --> 00:16:53,185
我不知道
I don't know.

393
00:16:53,691 --> 00:16:55,350
你干嘛不去问问这些猫?
Why don't you ask them cats?

394
00:16:58,294 --> 00:17:00,849
同时 回到Corleone 就像是Kunta Kinte (由非洲贩运过来后在美国的生活)
Meanwhile, back at Corleone, like Kunta Kinte,

395
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:03,003
我正在等我的自由书
I was waiting for my freedom papers.

396
00:17:03,004 --> 00:17:04,004
Greg!
Greg!

397
00:17:04,514 --> 00:17:06,402
嘿 哥们 你在这干嘛?
Hey, man. What are you doing here?

398
00:17:06,614 --> 00:17:09,669
我妈妈来拿我的档案 我要去Sanford了
My mom came to get my transcript. I'm going to Sanford.

399
00:17:09,672 --> 00:17:11,172
那么 你真的要走?
So, you're really gonna go?

400
00:17:11,661 --> 00:17:13,516
- 嗯 - 哥们!
- Yeah. - Man!

401
00:17:13,794 --> 00:17:16,370
至少你再也不用担心Caruso了
Well, at least you won't have to worry about Caruso anymore.

402
00:17:16,434 --> 00:17:18,378
嗯 你过的还好吗?
Yeah. How are things going for you?

403
00:17:18,534 --> 00:17:21,145
不知道 Caruso再也没来烦我了
I don't know. Caruso doesn't bother me anymore.

404
00:17:21,494 --> 00:17:23,348
事实上 没人来烦我
In fact, nobody bothers me.

405
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:25,355
真是有几分寂寞
It's kind of lonely.

406
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:28,272
他真的是寂寞到去怀念屁股被踢
He must be really lonely to miss an ass whuppin'.

407
00:17:28,354 --> 00:17:29,854
我要去上课了
Well, I got to go to class.

408
00:17:30,157 --> 00:17:31,157
好吧 再见
All right. See ya.

409
00:17:32,002 --> 00:17:33,477
嗯 再见
Yeah, see ya.

410
00:17:34,255 --> 00:17:36,166
- 祝你好运 - 谢谢
- Good luck. - Thanks.

411
00:17:36,499 --> 00:17:38,648
既然都差不多正式的了 接下来的一天
Since it was almost official, the next day,

412
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,458
我决定走到桑福德中学去
I decided to walk by Lamont Sanford,

413
00:17:40,508 --> 00:17:42,458
去切身感受一下到我附近学校
to get a feel of what it was gonna be like

414
00:17:42,493 --> 00:17:44,252
上学会是啥滋味
to go to school in my neighborhood.

415
00:17:45,296 --> 00:17:47,175
该死! 他们也在这欺负弱小!
Damn! They got bullies here, too!

416
00:17:50,627 --> 00:17:51,981
你看什么看?
What you looking at?

417
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:54,387
没啥 你们也在这上学?
Nothing. You guys go to school here?

418
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:57,096
是的 我在这儿上了16年了
Yeah. I've been going here for 16 years.

419
00:17:57,838 --> 00:18:00,838
现在 小子我问你-- 你看什么看?
Now boy, I asked you a question-- what you looking at?

420
00:18:01,031 --> 00:18:01,994
没啥
Nothing.

421
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,897
你说什么? 我们什么也不是?
So what you trying to say? We're nothing now?

422
00:18:03,898 --> 00:18:04,898
我只是
I just...

423
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,722
我禁不住想起要是Greg也在这儿
I couldn't help but think that if Greg was here,

424
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:09,967
他可以帮我分担一半的痛揍
he could've taken half of this beating.

425
00:18:15,438 --> 00:18:16,438
嗨 宝贝
Hi, baby.

426
00:18:17,454 --> 00:18:18,588
做了你的晚餐
I made you dinner.

427
00:18:21,953 --> 00:18:23,341
对你的工作我很抱歉
I'm sorry about your job.

428
00:18:24,008 --> 00:18:27,558
我知道 我不敢相信我有了份好工作
I know. I can't believe I get one good job

429
00:18:27,911 --> 00:18:29,968
几乎毁了我整个家
and it almost destroyed the whole family.

430
00:18:29,969 --> 00:18:30,969
没关系 宝贝
It's okay, baby.

431
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:34,345
别担心 有天你会找份别的好工作的
Don't worry. You'll find another good job one day.

432
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:38,301
曾有份好工作却弄丢了
It's better to have had one good job and lost it,

433
00:18:38,876 --> 00:18:41,264
比从没有份好工作要好的多
than to never have had one good job at all.

434
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:43,998
现在我有回到两份工作了
Now I'm back to two jobs.

435
00:18:44,111 --> 00:18:46,444
嗯 现在他的第2份工作是哲学家
Yeah, now his second job is a philosopher.

436
00:18:50,191 --> 00:18:51,589
怎么尝起来像是鱼腥味
That tastes like fish.

437
00:18:51,704 --> 00:18:52,838
我告诉过你!
I told you!

438
00:18:58,797 --> 00:19:00,197
回来整理你的锁柜?
Back to clean out your locker?

439
00:19:00,234 --> 00:19:01,586
不是 我只是回来了
Nope. Just back for good.

440
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:03,330
酷!
Cool!

441
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:04,953
嘿 这可不是断背
Hey, this ain't Brokeback.

442
00:19:05,407 --> 00:19:06,308
Greg!
Greg!

443
00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:07,309
对不起
Sorry.

444
00:19:07,715 --> 00:19:09,509
那么 是什么让你决定回来的?
So, what made you decide to come back?

445
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:13,127
我想过Corleone是我的问题 但是随后我发现真正的问题
I thought Corleone was my problem, but then I noticed the real problem.

446
00:19:13,128 --> 00:19:15,183
我又小 又是黑人 还不会打架
I'm little, skinny and I can't fight.

447
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,153
所以无论我去哪里 我还是我
So no matter where I go, I'm still the same guy.

448
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:19,336
他们揍了你
So, they jumped you.

449
00:19:19,337 --> 00:19:20,337
嗯
Yeah.

450
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:23,893
我想认识的混球比不认识的要好的多
I figure the bully you know is better than the bully you don't.

451
00:19:23,899 --> 00:19:24,899
嗨 大石头
Hey, Dolomite.

452
00:19:25,048 --> 00:19:26,048
欢迎回来
Welcome back.

453
00:19:26,849 --> 00:19:28,223
没有你真糟糕
It was rough without you.

454
00:19:28,224 --> 00:19:30,557
我不得不转去揍白人的孩子
I had to go back to beating up white kids.

455
00:19:31,278 --> 00:19:33,111
下次你决定退出时
The next time you decide to quit,

456
00:19:33,427 --> 00:19:34,982
可以让人知道吗?
could you let somebody know?

457
00:19:37,547 --> 00:19:38,769
那么 我们现在该做啥?
So, what do we do now?

458
00:19:39,047 --> 00:19:40,380
做我们经常做的
Same thing we always do.

459
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,553
欢迎你回来 哥们
Glad to have you back, man.

460
00:19:46,212 --> 00:19:49,318
那天我意识到 无论我去哪所学校
That day I realized that no matter what school I went to,

461
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:50,819
事情都会变得一团糟糕
things were gonna be rough.

462
00:19:51,078 --> 00:19:54,814
但是只要有Greg 事情都会好起来
But as long as I had Greg, things were gonna be all right.
