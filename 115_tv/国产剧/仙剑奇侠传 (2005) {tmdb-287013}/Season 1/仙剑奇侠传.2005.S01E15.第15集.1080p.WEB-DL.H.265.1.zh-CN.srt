1
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:06,417
In Bed-Stuy, a lot of people
have reputations for different things.

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,478
Diedre Garfield was 23
and had a reputation

3
00:00:10,521 --> 00:00:13,059
for being the youngest
grandmother in Brooklyn.

4
00:00:14,616 --> 00:00:16,462
All right,
I got everything under control!

5
00:00:16,485 --> 00:00:19,468
Mr. Jackson had a reputation
for being crazy as hell.

6
00:00:19,623 --> 00:00:21,983
And a lot of people say
he invented homelessness.

7
00:00:22,018 --> 00:00:22,934
Move the car!

8
00:00:22,979 --> 00:00:24,026
You want to fight?

9
00:00:25,762 --> 00:00:27,294
I had a reputation, too...

10
00:00:27,649 --> 00:00:30,704
not only for being a nerd
or getting beat up every day,

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,617
I was also known for being
the best Asteroids player in Bed-Stuy.

12
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:52,420
I'll beat people from all over:
Chinatown...

13
00:00:53,226 --> 00:00:55,560
Rikers...
the Village...

14
00:00:56,319 --> 00:00:57,707
Even though I was a nerd,

15
00:00:57,871 --> 00:01:01,982
it felt really good that there was
one thing that nobody could beat me at.

16
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,495
Chris,
somebody beat your score last night.

17
00:01:05,854 --> 00:01:08,185
Hey, even Mike Tyson
got knocked out.

18
00:01:12,542 --> 00:01:13,704
Ain't this about...

19
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:17,117
1x15 Everybody Hates the Lottery

Transcript: Raceman
Synchro: Sixe

21
00:01:49,011 --> 00:01:51,511
My mother had paying bills
down to a science,

22
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,582
but there were always things
she didn't count on.

23
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:57,191
Aah, damm it!

24
00:01:58,216 --> 00:01:59,216
Hey, honey.

25
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,670
Hey, baby.

26
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:02,321
What's wrong?

27
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:06,032
Well, I used this month's phone bill to
pay half of last mont's electric bill,

28
00:02:06,033 --> 00:02:08,124
and now I don't have enough
for the gas bill.

29
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,625
Well, why don't you just use
the electric bill money

30
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:11,729
to pay the electric bill?

31
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:13,372
Well, Tonya had to get a filling.

32
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:14,550
She had a cavity.

33
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,100
She did?

34
00:02:16,107 --> 00:02:18,259
My father never knew
when there was anything wrong

35
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,593
with the kids unless we were
unconscious or in the hospital.

36
00:02:23,485 --> 00:02:24,765
Oh... Oh, no, no, no.

37
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:26,697
We're gonna have to cut back.

38
00:02:26,744 --> 00:02:27,819
Cut back on what?

39
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,397
I mean,
we're barely getting by as it is.

40
00:02:32,531 --> 00:02:34,308
That look only meant one thing.

41
00:02:34,408 --> 00:02:35,530
Oh, no.

42
00:02:35,637 --> 00:02:37,441
Uh-uh. Uh-uh,
not my turtles.

43
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,540
You are not taking away my turtles.

44
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:43,190
My mother love chocolate turtles
more than anything else in the world.

45
00:02:43,225 --> 00:02:44,506
Whenever she ate one,

46
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,377
it was like all of life's problems
just went away.

47
00:03:06,741 --> 00:03:09,963
It's a good thing she chose
those turtles instead of guns.

48
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,712
Those chocolate turtles
are costing us $12 a box.

49
00:03:13,497 --> 00:03:15,219
You gotta take away my turtles.

50
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,792
You know I need my turtles.

51
00:03:19,377 --> 00:03:21,898
Why don't you cut off
your lottery playing?

52
00:03:22,214 --> 00:03:23,409
I ain't cutting off my number.

53
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:24,108
Oh!

54
00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:26,609
If you don't play,
how can you expect to win?

55
00:03:26,668 --> 00:03:28,468
Look,
it says so right here.

56
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:29,620
Oh, no, no, no.

57
00:03:29,704 --> 00:03:30,902
No that damned dream book.

58
00:03:30,937 --> 00:03:33,539
My dad was the most
level-headed person I knew,

59
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,490
except when it came
to playing the lottery,

60
00:03:35,491 --> 00:03:38,268
and he always consulted
his lucky star dream book.

61
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,818
A dream book takes
any possible dream you can have

62
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,011
and transforms it
into a lucky number.

63
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:47,160
You dreamt about a monkey on the train
in the middle of a blizzard.

64
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:49,171
Here it is--
eight-one-four!

65
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,621
I dreamt Dr. J was roller-skating
with two white women in Sweden.

66
00:03:54,425 --> 00:03:58,593
Here it is-- sx-two-one.
White ladies?

67
00:03:59,387 --> 00:04:01,352
Rochelle,
if I win the lottery,

68
00:04:01,372 --> 00:04:03,507
you can buy all the chocolate turtles you want.

69
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,508
But you eating chocolate turtles
ain't helping nobody.

70
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,169
Well, if you're playing the lottery,

71
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,392
I'm eating my turtles.

72
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,274
All right...
I'll quit the lottery.

73
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,130
Okay, then.

74
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,496
Can you believe this is a real argument

75
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,495
At school, even Greg
was getting a reputation.

76
00:04:23,689 --> 00:04:25,244
And for "Best Attendance"...

77
00:04:26,092 --> 00:04:27,176
Gregory Wuliger!

78
00:04:27,469 --> 00:04:28,632
Yes!

79
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,772
Getting an award for attendance

80
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,411
is kind of like getting
an award for breathing.

81
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,832
Wait, your dad is giving you
$5 just for coming to school?

82
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,354
I bet him I wouldn't miss
a day of school this year.

83
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:46,258
So far so good.

84
00:04:46,293 --> 00:04:48,619
My mother told me
I'd better not miss a day of school

85
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,792
or else she'd take $5 off my ass.

86
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,757
This is so cool.

87
00:04:51,793 --> 00:04:54,948
The only award I could've gotten at
Corleone would've been...

88
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:57,700
For
"Taking the Best Ass Whooping"...

89
00:04:58,635 --> 00:04:59,609
Chris.

90
00:05:19,187 --> 00:05:20,560
But instead of an award,

91
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,799
I had Asteroids.

92
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:25,330
Hey, I got the top five scores
on Asteroids yesterday.

93
00:05:25,496 --> 00:05:27,168
Get out of here.
No way.

94
00:05:27,338 --> 00:05:29,297
Yeah, but some kid beat me.

95
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:31,837
I gotta protect my title.

96
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,861
Man, you're just like Apollo Creed
in Rocky II.

97
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,973
You sure you can beat this guy?

98
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:40,007
Eh,
I've got a reputation to maintain.

99
00:05:41,861 --> 00:05:44,000
Hey, Tonya, ask Daddy for some money

100
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,467
so we can get some candy tomorrow.

101
00:05:45,468 --> 00:05:46,745
How come you can't ask?

102
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,998
Because if I ask,
he'll give me a speech.

103
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,375
If  you ask,
he'll give you the money.

104
00:05:52,524 --> 00:05:56,215
If Daddy gives me the money,
you have to share some of that candy.

105
00:05:56,431 --> 00:05:57,431
Okay.

106
00:06:03,938 --> 00:06:04,938
Six...

107
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,343
D addy.

108
00:06:10,483 --> 00:06:11,728
Huh? What?

109
00:06:11,834 --> 00:06:13,062
Can I have a dollar?

110
00:06:13,504 --> 00:06:15,170
What  do you need a dollar for?

111
00:06:15,211 --> 00:06:16,807
I want to get Drew some, um...

112
00:06:16,808 --> 00:06:17,808
some candy.

113
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,002
Oh... that's nice.

114
00:06:21,015 --> 00:06:22,792
My father was crazy about Tonya.

115
00:06:22,921 --> 00:06:25,217
She was the only one in the house
who would dare

116
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,638
take sleep and money
from him at the same time.

117
00:06:27,661 --> 00:06:28,889
Thanks, Daddy.

118
00:06:29,488 --> 00:06:32,718
In Bed-Stuy, we never had
a real video arcade to go to.

119
00:06:32,991 --> 00:06:34,431
All we had was Doc's.

120
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,006
At Doc's,
you can get almost anything.

121
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,727
You could cash a check.

122
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,950
That would be $5.

123
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,609
You could get an alibi.

124
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,830
Nah, it wasn't him.

125
00:06:43,927 --> 00:06:45,061
He was here.

126
00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:48,770
That'll be $5.

127
00:06:49,271 --> 00:06:51,326
You could even get your teeth pulled.

128
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,129
Open.

129
00:06:59,053 --> 00:07:00,830
Your mama know you're down here?

130
00:07:01,111 --> 00:07:02,011
Yes, sir.

131
00:07:02,012 --> 00:07:04,109
My mother didn't like me
hanging out at Doc's

132
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,963
'cause she thought
that would eventually lead to this.

133
00:07:06,964 --> 00:07:07,964
I'm a junkie.

134
00:07:08,622 --> 00:07:09,622
A crackhead.

135
00:07:10,522 --> 00:07:13,410
Look, just tell my ma
her oldest son is a crackhead.

136
00:07:14,072 --> 00:07:14,781
Hey!

137
00:07:14,782 --> 00:07:16,230
Little dude from across the street.

138
00:07:16,231 --> 00:07:17,730
Usually Jerome would rob me,

139
00:07:17,731 --> 00:07:19,744
but not when
I was about to play Asertoids.

140
00:07:19,767 --> 00:07:21,193
You getting ready to play Asteroids?

141
00:07:21,204 --> 00:07:22,641
Yes. Some guy beat my score.

142
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,304
For real?
Oh, no!

143
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,756
I know you're not
gonna take that, man.

144
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,457
You'd better protect your rep.

145
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:32,500
If I didn't get my high score back,

146
00:07:32,506 --> 00:07:34,940
somebody was gonna
get hit with a brick.

147
00:07:53,989 --> 00:07:55,334
You're Chris.

148
00:07:57,335 --> 00:07:58,563
Hey,
he's big.

149
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:00,046
So you're Doah.

150
00:08:03,342 --> 00:08:04,342
Doah.

151
00:08:06,142 --> 00:08:07,347
That's DOA.

152
00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:09,289
It means
"Dead On Arrival."

153
00:08:09,742 --> 00:08:10,742
My name is Jorge.

154
00:08:12,296 --> 00:08:13,740
So what, you want to play?

155
00:08:14,752 --> 00:08:15,599
Come on.

156
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,556
I know it looks strange,

157
00:08:16,557 --> 00:08:19,266
but before peple got
play stations in their backseats,

158
00:08:19,267 --> 00:08:22,267
you actually have to go
someplace to play video games.

159
00:08:41,171 --> 00:08:43,282
All right, man,
that was  a good game.

160
00:08:46,049 --> 00:08:47,565
Hey, where are you going?

161
00:08:47,634 --> 00:08:48,633
I gotta get home.

162
00:08:48,634 --> 00:08:50,833
What, you're not gonna
give him a rematch?

163
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:53,042
Yeah, you can' t just beat the man
and walk out.

164
00:08:53,043 --> 00:08:54,785
Hey, I really gotta go.

165
00:08:55,293 --> 00:08:57,181
Besides, I'll just beat him again.

166
00:08:58,987 --> 00:09:00,975
Want to put some money on that?

167
00:09:02,212 --> 00:09:04,067
If you have a good reputation,

168
00:09:04,156 --> 00:09:06,759
you have to be willing to do
anything to protect it.

169
00:09:06,853 --> 00:09:08,086
I can't play for money.

170
00:09:10,382 --> 00:09:12,246
Don't tell me you're scared.

171
00:09:12,325 --> 00:09:13,323
I'm not.

172
00:09:13,358 --> 00:09:14,649
I just gotta go home.

173
00:09:14,781 --> 00:09:16,532
Hey, I can't believe you.

174
00:09:16,831 --> 00:09:18,275
You're scared of this dude.

175
00:09:18,737 --> 00:09:20,591
Come on, yo,
get home, come on.

176
00:09:21,141 --> 00:09:22,520
Anybody got five bucks?

177
00:09:31,718 --> 00:09:33,001
Hey! I need a favor.

178
00:09:34,018 --> 00:09:35,822
I need to borrow your five dollars.

179
00:09:35,823 --> 00:09:37,489
What?
What do you need it for?

180
00:09:37,933 --> 00:09:39,482
I beat this kid playing Asteroids,

181
00:09:39,483 --> 00:09:41,427
and now he wants to play for money.

182
00:09:41,632 --> 00:09:43,854
Can't you just save up
your lunch money?

183
00:09:43,991 --> 00:09:45,741
Or take your neighbor's garbage out?

184
00:09:45,742 --> 00:09:48,447
Or help small ladies
carry groceries to their car.

185
00:09:48,448 --> 00:09:50,344
Or turn in some Coke bottles
or something.

186
00:09:50,345 --> 00:09:52,526
Note yourself when begging,
be persistent.

187
00:09:53,641 --> 00:09:55,997
Hey,
I don't have time for this.

188
00:09:56,184 --> 00:09:57,294
You got to do this,

189
00:09:57,295 --> 00:09:59,239
or my reputation's gonna be ruined.

190
00:09:59,292 --> 00:10:02,227
I wonder if that's how O.J.
got A.C. to drive that Bronco.

191
00:10:05,531 --> 00:10:06,521
Thanks.

192
00:10:09,731 --> 00:10:11,286
After a day with no turtles,

193
00:10:11,382 --> 00:10:14,326
my mother was going through
serious sugar withdrawal.

194
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,786
She'd eat any sugar she could find.

195
00:10:24,461 --> 00:10:26,238
From anywhere she could find it.

196
00:10:29,448 --> 00:10:33,679
All I can tell you is that crack
ain't got nothin' on chocolate turtles.

197
00:10:36,934 --> 00:10:37,740
Here.

198
00:10:37,741 --> 00:10:39,407
Drew was getting his fix, too.

199
00:10:39,943 --> 00:10:41,942
I know you're giving me
more than that.

200
00:10:41,977 --> 00:10:44,009
You're not supposed
to be eating candy, anyway.

201
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,287
You just got a filling.

202
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,231
I'm telling Mama!

203
00:10:56,936 --> 00:10:59,684
Some people had rum,
my mom had Aunt Jemima.

204
00:11:09,552 --> 00:11:10,479
Mama, see?

205
00:11:10,526 --> 00:11:12,648
Drew got some candy,
and this is all he gave me--

206
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,558
- three piec... Ma!
- Candy?

207
00:11:14,594 --> 00:11:15,851
Did you say candy?

208
00:11:16,061 --> 00:11:17,855
- Yeah?
- Drew, get in here!

209
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:21,560
You got candy?

210
00:11:21,812 --> 00:11:23,219
- Ma!
- Don't "Ma" me.

211
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,831
Don't "Ma" me right now, boy.

212
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,267
Do you have anything in here that...

213
00:11:27,911 --> 00:11:30,178
- ...that tastes like turtles?
- No.

214
00:11:30,213 --> 00:11:32,179
Something that has chocolate,
peanuts, caramel,

215
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,632
- something like that?
- I don't know.

216
00:11:33,655 --> 00:11:35,780
Well, where in the world
did you get money for candy?

217
00:11:35,781 --> 00:11:36,781
Daddy.

218
00:11:39,111 --> 00:11:40,111
Oh...!

219
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:44,826
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

220
00:11:44,827 --> 00:11:46,385
What he's actually talking about is

221
00:11:46,386 --> 00:11:50,052
which one of us he's gonna rob
after we get through with the game.

222
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:54,290
- Ha!
- Oh, whoa!

223
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,347
- Wh-Wh-What's wrong with you!
- Turtles!

224
00:11:57,547 --> 00:12:01,038
I ain't got my turtles!

225
00:12:01,909 --> 00:12:07,192
I'm over here drinking syrup while
you're still buying lottery tickets.

226
00:12:08,242 --> 00:12:09,483
What's wrong with me!

227
00:12:10,468 --> 00:12:11,928
What's wrong with you?!

228
00:12:12,518 --> 00:12:14,542
Baby, I did it for you.

229
00:12:14,577 --> 00:12:16,667
Julius,
we both had an agreement.

230
00:12:17,876 --> 00:12:20,864
And you have to honor
that agreement.

231
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:24,941
Do you know what kind of message
we are sending to our children?!

232
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:27,516
- Message?
- You're telling our kids,

233
00:12:27,551 --> 00:12:29,336
"Oh, go ahead, little children,

234
00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:30,662
ignore your mother,

235
00:12:30,707 --> 00:12:31,878
'cause she's a lunatic"!

236
00:12:31,913 --> 00:12:33,757
- I didn't say that!
- Yes, you did!

237
00:12:33,767 --> 00:12:35,878
What I meant was,
it's just... it's...

238
00:12:37,222 --> 00:12:38,774
it's just a couple of dollars.

239
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:40,539
Are we cutting back?

240
00:12:41,943 --> 00:12:44,937
Or  am I...
cutting back.

241
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,263
'Cause I can't do it by myself.

242
00:12:49,391 --> 00:12:50,446
Ah, baby, no, baby.

243
00:12:50,496 --> 00:12:51,395
I feel alone...

244
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:54,297
No, no, we-we're cutting back,
we're cutting back, okay?

245
00:12:54,298 --> 00:12:56,661
I'm sorry.
We can do this!

246
00:12:57,317 --> 00:12:58,266
We can do this.

247
00:12:58,267 --> 00:12:59,711
I get the shakes at night,

248
00:12:59,867 --> 00:13:01,606
Julius, I get the shakes!

249
00:13:03,341 --> 00:13:04,964
It's all right, we can do this.

250
00:13:04,965 --> 00:13:05,965
Okay.

251
00:13:07,914 --> 00:13:08,914
Okay.

252
00:13:11,425 --> 00:13:12,425
Fine.

253
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:23,019
Yeah, baby!
Oh, yeah, baby!

254
00:13:23,105 --> 00:13:24,549
Watch out, let me through.

255
00:13:25,147 --> 00:13:26,192
Good game.

256
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:27,513
You almost had him.

257
00:13:28,104 --> 00:13:29,724
You got a lot of heart, little dude.

258
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,558
I wonder if I could sell my heart
for five dollars.

259
00:13:32,622 --> 00:13:33,570
You lost?

260
00:13:33,571 --> 00:13:34,571
How can you lose?

261
00:13:34,834 --> 00:13:36,083
Hey, I'll pay you back--

262
00:13:36,176 --> 00:13:39,405
I'll... carry some groceries or
return some soda bottles or something.

263
00:13:39,505 --> 00:13:40,978
That crap'll take forever!

264
00:13:41,565 --> 00:13:43,042
Well, why'd you tell me to do it?

265
00:13:43,043 --> 00:13:45,431
Because I didn't want
to give you my money?

266
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:47,591
I'm as surprised as you are.

267
00:13:47,592 --> 00:13:50,654
No. I'd say you're about
five bucks less surprised than I am.

268
00:13:50,655 --> 00:13:52,766
He's starting to sound like my father.

269
00:13:57,765 --> 00:13:58,765
Hey.

270
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,236
I'm gonna pay you back.

271
00:14:00,812 --> 00:14:03,089
It'll take a couple of weeks,
but I will.

272
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,718
You got to play him again.

273
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,558
No.
I don't think so.

274
00:14:07,896 --> 00:14:09,133
What about your rep?

275
00:14:09,523 --> 00:14:12,011
I've got a new one:
sucker.

276
00:14:13,823 --> 00:14:14,934
Come on.

277
00:14:18,917 --> 00:14:21,655
I missed being the Asteroids champ
of Bed-Stuy.

278
00:14:21,701 --> 00:14:22,523
Without that,

279
00:14:22,558 --> 00:14:25,094
I was just another bum
from the neighborhood.

280
00:14:35,491 --> 00:14:36,916
My father wouldn't usually admit

281
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:40,305
he was wrong about things,
at least not in front of the kids.

282
00:14:40,592 --> 00:14:41,813
I have something to say.

283
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:43,364
I thought he was about to tell us

284
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:45,946
he was leaving us
for a white family across town.

285
00:14:46,835 --> 00:14:47,835
I'm sorry.

286
00:14:48,987 --> 00:14:49,987
What'd you do?

287
00:14:51,134 --> 00:14:55,356
After your mother gave up her chocolate
turtles so we could pay the bills...

288
00:14:55,545 --> 00:14:56,711
I played the lottery.

289
00:14:57,045 --> 00:14:58,545
I shouldn't have done that.

290
00:14:58,695 --> 00:14:59,695
I  was wrong.

291
00:15:00,815 --> 00:15:02,870
Is that why she ate up all our candy?

292
00:15:03,465 --> 00:15:05,814
I should've never
given you money for candy.

293
00:15:05,815 --> 00:15:06,815
Dad, um,

294
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:08,451
it's not all her fault.

295
00:15:09,924 --> 00:15:11,090
I asked her to do it.

296
00:15:11,283 --> 00:15:13,220
But only because
I knew you'd give it to her.

297
00:15:13,256 --> 00:15:14,256
How'd you know that?

298
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:16,440
Because you give her
everything she wants.

299
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:17,534
That's not true.

300
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:20,033
One time I asked if
I could set Chris on fire,

301
00:15:20,034 --> 00:15:21,645
and he didn't let me do that.

302
00:15:21,738 --> 00:15:23,404
Well, thank goodness for that.

303
00:15:24,944 --> 00:15:26,332
I have a confession, too.

304
00:15:27,505 --> 00:15:29,853
I've been hanging out
at that corner store.

305
00:15:29,854 --> 00:15:32,388
- Chris...
- But I was only playing Asteroids.

306
00:15:32,655 --> 00:15:34,547
Oh.
Well, that ain't so bad.

307
00:15:35,776 --> 00:15:37,326
And I lost five dollars.

308
00:15:38,092 --> 00:15:40,006
What?!
Five dollars?

309
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:41,685
Ooh... I'm telling!

310
00:15:41,744 --> 00:15:44,386
Now, who are you gonna tell?
We're all sitting right here.

311
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:46,074
How did you lose five dollars, boy?

312
00:15:46,075 --> 00:15:47,797
Where did you get five dollars?

313
00:15:47,874 --> 00:15:50,298
I bet a guy playing Asteroids, and...

314
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,339
and I got the five dollars from Greg.

315
00:15:53,513 --> 00:15:55,293
What are you doing
betting on video games?

316
00:15:55,294 --> 00:15:57,288
I was trying
to protect my reputation.

317
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,294
You have a reputation?

318
00:15:58,295 --> 00:15:59,295
Yeah.

319
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,430
I am the best player on the block.

320
00:16:02,293 --> 00:16:03,784
Then how come you didn't win?

321
00:16:03,831 --> 00:16:05,622
Because you need to be quiet,
that's why!

322
00:16:05,657 --> 00:16:06,726
Don't tell me to be...

323
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,379
Hey, hey,
that's enough.

324
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,468
It's your problem.

325
00:16:10,577 --> 00:16:12,176
You borrowed it,
you pay it back.

326
00:16:12,177 --> 00:16:12,927
I am.

327
00:16:12,928 --> 00:16:15,186
Well, I know I better not hear no more
about you betting money,

328
00:16:15,221 --> 00:16:16,677
- you hear me?
- Yes, ma'am.

329
00:16:16,678 --> 00:16:17,678
All right.

330
00:16:19,838 --> 00:16:21,488
Mama, can we have our candy...

331
00:16:21,489 --> 00:16:22,489
No!

332
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:24,189
I ate it.

333
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:28,860
I don't need y'all getting
any more cavities than what y'all got.

334
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,402
No cavities in this house.

335
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:33,480
But at this rate,
there'll be plenty of diabetes.

336
00:16:45,931 --> 00:16:47,153
Needs some more sugar.

337
00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:53,799
You all right?

338
00:16:54,098 --> 00:16:55,264
Yeah, I'm just tired.

339
00:16:55,546 --> 00:16:59,212
I had this weird dream last night
and couldn't fall back to sleep.

340
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:00,559
Dream, huh?

341
00:17:02,107 --> 00:17:03,273
Yeah, it was bizarre.

342
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:06,267
I was walking down the street,

343
00:17:06,268 --> 00:17:07,712
waving hello to everybody,

344
00:17:07,767 --> 00:17:09,267
but nobody was waving back.

345
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,458
It was as if they couldn't see me.

346
00:17:15,187 --> 00:17:16,409
So you were invisible?

347
00:17:16,923 --> 00:17:17,687
Yeah.

348
00:17:17,722 --> 00:17:20,059
Mama had turtles,
Daddy had the lottery.

349
00:17:20,434 --> 00:17:21,489
Oh, that's right...

350
00:17:21,678 --> 00:17:23,511
It's a wonder nobody sold the TV.

351
00:17:25,365 --> 00:17:26,733
I need you to go to the corner

352
00:17:26,734 --> 00:17:28,944
store after school
and buy a lottery ticket for me.

353
00:17:28,945 --> 00:17:30,196
Six-three-seven.

354
00:17:30,713 --> 00:17:33,190
- Yeah, but you said you weren't...
- I know what I said!

355
00:17:33,394 --> 00:17:34,344
Huh?

356
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,153
I've just got a feeling about this.

357
00:17:36,154 --> 00:17:38,876
Translation:
Just shut up and do what I tell you.

358
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:41,412
Now, keep this between me
and you, all right?

359
00:17:41,413 --> 00:17:42,913
Six-three-seven,
all right?

360
00:17:43,008 --> 00:17:45,209
And  keep the ticket on you.
Go! Go, go, go!

361
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:49,043
He hadn't been that excited about
a dream since Martin Luther King's.

362
00:17:55,629 --> 00:17:56,906
What do you need today?

363
00:17:56,977 --> 00:18:00,977
My father played the lottery a thousand
times and lost a thousand times.

364
00:18:01,335 --> 00:18:02,890
I had only lost my rep once,

365
00:18:03,237 --> 00:18:05,681
and I wasn't about
to let that happen again.

366
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:08,264
Give me four quarters.

367
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,405
Now you're talking.

368
00:18:18,768 --> 00:18:20,768
Want to play me
for some more money?

369
00:18:20,828 --> 00:18:22,105
I don't have any money.

370
00:18:23,078 --> 00:18:25,078
I just want to prove
I can beat you.

371
00:18:37,718 --> 00:18:38,705
No...

372
00:18:40,852 --> 00:18:43,670
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

373
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,710
One-zero, sucka! ha!

374
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:48,419
Good game, man.

375
00:18:48,956 --> 00:18:50,223
You should've bet me, though.

376
00:18:50,224 --> 00:18:51,224
If I had bet him,

377
00:18:51,379 --> 00:18:54,228
I couldn't help but think
that this would've happened.

378
00:18:54,229 --> 00:18:55,105
Ah, I'm hungry.

379
00:18:55,221 --> 00:18:56,879
Looks, good, huh?

380
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:00,886
Who are you?

381
00:19:00,887 --> 00:19:01,737
I'm Jorge.

382
00:19:01,738 --> 00:19:04,197
I won your family from Chris
playing Asteroids.

383
00:19:04,198 --> 00:19:06,364
I told Chris to stay out
of that store.

384
00:19:06,694 --> 00:19:08,275
- Can you cook mofongo?
- What?

385
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,149
- What'd you call her?
- Come tu comida.

386
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:15,647
I was raised around Puerto Ricans?

387
00:19:15,707 --> 00:19:17,863
There's something about
defending your reputation

388
00:19:17,864 --> 00:19:20,763
that makes you feel like
you really accomplished something.

389
00:19:20,764 --> 00:19:23,216
And even though
I didn't get Greg's money back,

390
00:19:23,217 --> 00:19:24,363
I had my rep.

391
00:19:25,427 --> 00:19:27,778
Even though my father
never won the lottery,

392
00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:29,827
it always made him feel like
there was one thing

393
00:19:29,828 --> 00:19:31,939
in the world
he had a shot at winning.

394
00:19:32,489 --> 00:19:34,439
And to him,
that dollar was worth it.

395
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,136
And tonight's winning numbers are...

396
00:19:36,137 --> 00:19:37,137
Six...

397
00:19:37,488 --> 00:19:38,488
three...

398
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,800
seven.

399
00:19:40,643 --> 00:19:42,564
I won! I won!

400
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:43,849
I won!

401
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:45,999
- What happened?
- My number hit!

402
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,041
Chris, show your mama the ticket.

403
00:19:48,859 --> 00:19:50,581
Show your mama the ticket, man!

404
00:19:52,409 --> 00:19:53,853
Show your mama the ticket.

405
00:19:55,063 --> 00:19:56,063
Mama!
