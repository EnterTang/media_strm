既然现在是给予的季节

我希望大家都能带些罐装食品
I'd like you all to bring in canned food items,

你不用勉强带
You don't have to bring anything,

66
00:02:59,486 --> 00:03:01,341
难为你这么有心了

67
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:05,115
我知道一年中的这时候 你家肯定很困难

谁把热水都用光了?

那 宝贝 要花多少钱啊?

83

天 孩子们圣诞节要的礼物太多了

89
00:03:50,928 --> 00:03:53,043
当我还是个孩子的时候 不是买礼物

90
00:03:53,078 --> 00:03:55,003
而是我老爸把警察叫到家里

Okay. But don't take generic brands.

134
00:05:29,045 --> 00:05:30,132
那些名牌儿的
Only store brands.

135
00:05:30,248 --> 00:05:33,684
我不想让那些人觉得我们捐不起
I do not want those people thinking we can't afford to donate food.

136
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,235
<i>我老妈可以把我们 所有的食物送出去</i>
<i>My mother would give away all the food we had if she</i>

137
00:05:36,265 --> 00:05:38,542
<i>如果她觉得这样 可以证明我们衣食无缺</i>
<i>thought it would prove we didn't need it.</i>

138
00:05:39,227 --> 00:05:41,223
你为什么说我的礼物单白痴?
How come you say my list is stupid?

139
00:05:41,265 --> 00:05:43,890
因为 每个人都知道没圣诞老人
Because, everybody knows there's no Santa Claus.

140
00:05:44,326 --> 00:05:46,381
过来 我给你看点东西
Come here, let me show you something.

141
00:05:48,317 --> 00:05:49,456
我们这是去哪儿?
Where are we going?

142
00:05:49,997 --> 00:05:51,652
我带你去看玩具
I'm taking you to the toys.

143
00:05:51,741 --> 00:05:53,459
没有圣诞老人烟囱里进来
Santa doesn't come down the chimney.

144
00:05:53,489 --> 00:05:55,838
我们甚至都没烟囱 只有散热器
We don't even have a chimney, we have radiators.

145
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:58,610
你听说过有圣诞老人 从散热器里进来吗?
Have you ever heard of Santa Claus coming through radiators?

146
00:05:58,757 --> 00:06:02,757
可是我们的玩具怎么可能准备好呢 我的礼物单都没写完呢
But how can we have our toys already if I haven't even finished my list?

147
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:04,496
因为...
Because.

148
00:06:05,496 --> 00:06:06,496
嘿 儿子
Hey, man.

149
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:07,999
在干嘛?
What you doing?

150
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:10,667
把罐头带到学校给穷人
I'm taking canned goods to school for the needy.

151
00:06:16,703 --> 00:06:18,758
儿子 这些罐头总价2块8毛9呢
Man, that's $2.89 cent worth of food.

152
00:06:18,823 --> 00:06:19,673
你在想什么那
What you trying to do,

153
00:06:19,703 --> 00:06:21,425
救穷人还是当穷人?
feed the needy or be the needy?

154
00:06:21,455 --> 00:06:23,192
- Rochelle! - Julius!
- Rochelle! - Julius!

155
00:06:23,193 --> 00:06:25,660
“我就挣那么点钱”

156
00:06:25,908 --> 00:06:27,077
“你怎么还想法乱花”
<i>My parents tried not argue in front of the kids,</i>

157
00:06:27,364 --> 00:06:29,795
<i>“我不想让人觉得我们破产了” 我父母不想在孩子面前吵架 </i>

158
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:31,845
<i>“我不想让人觉得我们破产了” 所以他们就用脸色交流</i>
<i>so instead, they just made faces.</i>

159
00:06:31,846 --> 00:06:33,751
我们马上破产！

160
00:06:33,752 --> 00:06:36,131
但他们不必知道！

161
00:06:38,161 --> 00:06:39,801
<i>他们还能用脸诅咒彼此</i>
<i>They make curse out faces, too,</i>

162
00:06:39,878 --> 00:06:41,614
<i>但不能给你们看</i>
<i>but we can't show you those.</i>

163
00:06:41,927 --> 00:06:45,559
<i>与此同时 Drew在给Tanya 看一些孩子不该看的东西</i>
<i>Meanwhile, Drew was showing Tanya something no kid should see.</i>

164
00:06:47,676 --> 00:06:48,832
看到没 告诉过你了
See, I told you.

165
00:06:56,925 --> 00:06:58,036
哇噢! 酷!
Whoa! Cool!

166
00:07:03,245 --> 00:07:05,351
<i>有糟糕一天的不止是Tonya</i>
<i>Tonya wasn't the only one having a bad day.</i>

167
00:07:05,386 --> 00:07:06,736
有什么问题吗?
Is there something wrong?

168
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:10,201
坐下来 宝贝
Have a seat, baby.

169
00:07:10,558 --> 00:07:13,538
<i>上一次他们让我坐下来 是听他们宣布</i>
<i>The last time they asked me to sit down before they told me something,</i>

170
00:07:13,568 --> 00:07:15,012
<i>杰克逊五人组*解散的消息 (*MJ小时候和兄弟们组的乐队)</i>
<i>The Jackson Five broke up.</i>

171
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,670
嘿 Chris
Hey, Chris.

172
00:07:17,328 --> 00:07:20,000
呃 宝贝 听着 我知道你早就盼着
Um, baby, look, I know you've been looking forward to getting

173
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,752
圣诞节能得到随身听了
that new Walkman for Christmas.

174
00:07:22,081 --> 00:07:24,189
还有 Chris 我一直希望我的孩子
And, Chris, I've always wanted my kids

175
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,912
能比我小时候圣诞节过的好
to have a better Christmas than I had growing up.

176
00:07:26,987 --> 00:07:28,209
但你越长大
But the older you get,

177
00:07:28,743 --> 00:07:31,909
所要做的牺牲也就越多
the more you learn about the sacrifices you have to make.

178
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,150
牺牲?
Sacrifices?

179
00:07:34,649 --> 00:07:35,649
呃...
Uh...

180
00:07:36,654 --> 00:07:37,654
呃...
Uh...

181
00:07:38,254 --> 00:07:41,396
比如不能买新的工作靴 这样你的孩子就能有鞋穿
Like not getting a new pair of work boots so you kids can have shoes.

182
00:07:41,426 --> 00:07:44,926
再比如你乘地铁去上班 这样你老婆就能有车开
Or like taking the subway to work so your wife can use the car.

183
00:07:44,927 --> 00:07:46,212
“我说我会给你买车的！”

184
00:07:47,315 --> 00:07:49,740
“我说什么了”

185
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,515
妈妈 爸爸 我13岁了
Mom, Dad, I'm 13.

186
00:07:53,726 --> 00:07:55,770
那 你圣诞节收不到礼物了
Well, you're not getting a present for Christmas.

187
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,855
<i>他说这个时 就好像我们培根吃光了</i>
<i>He said that like we're out of bacon.</i>

188
00:07:59,374 --> 00:08:01,383
我们必须要买个新热水器
We got to buy a new water heater.

189
00:08:01,685 --> 00:08:04,094
好吧 那我们得想想怎么 告诉Drew和Tonya
Well, then, we need a plan to tell Drew and Tonya.

190
00:08:04,129 --> 00:08:05,081
告诉他们什么?
Tell them what?

191
00:08:05,082 --> 00:08:06,888
圣诞节得不到任何礼物啊
That they're not getting any presents for Christmas.

192
00:08:06,912 --> 00:08:09,633
谁说他们圣诞节得不到礼物了?
Who said they weren't getting anything for Christmas?

193
00:08:10,035 --> 00:08:12,320
等等 他们有东西拿我没有?
Wait, they're getting stuff and I'm not?

194
00:08:13,155 --> 00:08:14,266
你比他们大 Chris
You're older, Chris.

195
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,299
他们不理解
They wouldn't understand.

196
00:08:18,258 --> 00:08:19,816
我什么都没有吗?
Am I gonna get anything?

197
00:08:20,415 --> 00:08:24,978
哦 宝贝 热水你想用多少就用多少
Oh, baby, you'll be able to use up all the hot water you want.

198
00:08:25,418 --> 00:08:27,306
<i>这么说我得到的 就只是干净屁股了?</i>
<i>So all I'm getting is a clean ass?</i>

199
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,713
热气腾腾哦
Steaming hot.

200
00:08:28,783 --> 00:08:31,989
<i># 人人都恨克里斯 #</i>
<i>#  Everybody hates Chris. #</i>

201
00:08:39,498 --> 00:08:41,470
这么说圣诞节你什么都得不到了?
So you're not getting anything for Christmas?

202
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,500
是滴
Nope.

203
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,655
哥们 圣诞节没礼物?
Man, nothing for Christmas?

204
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:46,945
这算不算虐待儿童啊?
Isn't that considered child abuse?

205
00:08:47,464 --> 00:08:48,605
确实有这种感觉
Sure does feel like it.

206
00:08:48,652 --> 00:08:51,094
至少他们会在你袜子里放些什么吧?
They're at least gonna put something in your stocking, right?

207
00:08:51,117 --> 00:08:52,478
可能是根剩香肠什么的吧
Maybe some leftover sausage.

208
00:08:53,618 --> 00:08:55,673
应该立法来阻止此类事发生
There's got to be a law against this.

209
00:08:56,629 --> 00:08:58,594
哦 Chris 看看你
Oh, Chris, look at you.

210
00:08:59,532 --> 00:09:01,420
你不用带食物来的
You didn't have to bring any food.

211
00:09:01,932 --> 00:09:04,487
有时我忘了你们的人民有多坚强
Sometimes I forget how strong your people are.

212
00:09:04,787 --> 00:09:06,807
你说我们的人民有多坚强 是什么意思?
What  do you mean how strong my people are?

213
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:09,550
"我说你们的人民有多坚强 是什么意思"?
"What do I mean how strong your people are?"

214
00:09:09,973 --> 00:09:12,087
总有一天你会明白的
You shall overcome someday.

215
00:09:13,046 --> 00:09:14,101
下课后来找我
See me after class.

216
00:09:14,165 --> 00:09:15,740
我有东西送给你
I have something for you.

217
00:09:16,908 --> 00:09:17,908
Ok
Okay.

218
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:22,081
我们会明白的
We shall overcome

219
00:09:24,369 --> 00:09:25,644
我们会
We shall

220
00:09:26,021 --> 00:09:27,460
明白的...
overcome...

221
00:09:31,143 --> 00:09:34,198
Tonya 我以为你在挂装饰物呢
Tonya, I thought you were gonna put up the decorations.

222
00:09:34,254 --> 00:09:35,365
我现在不太想
I don't want to now.

223
00:09:36,457 --> 00:09:37,457
为什么呀?
Why not?

224
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,931
因为 你和爹的骗我
Because... you and Daddy lied to me.

225
00:09:42,689 --> 00:09:44,715
我们骗你? 什么啊?
We lied to you? About what?

226
00:09:45,121 --> 00:09:47,565
我知道没有圣诞老人这回事
I know there's no such thing as Santa Claus.

227
00:09:48,226 --> 00:09:50,712
<i>当我老妈听到 Tonya说出这几个字</i>
<i>When my mother heard Tonya say those words,</i>

228
00:09:50,778 --> 00:09:53,000
<i>就好像Tonya不再是 她的宝贝女儿一样</i>
<i>it was like she wasn't her baby anymore.</i>

229
00:09:53,207 --> 00:09:54,711
那你们还想骗我什么?
So what else to you lie to me about?

230
00:09:54,734 --> 00:09:56,783
我要怀孕了你们真把我赶出去吗?
Are you really gonna kick me out if I get pregnant?

231
00:09:56,819 --> 00:09:58,521
你说你不养孩子是真的吗?
Is it true you ain't taking care of no baby?

232
00:09:58,545 --> 00:10:00,166
我真不能带白人男孩回家吗?
Can I really not bring a white boy home?

233
00:10:00,188 --> 00:10:01,907
烤炉食品真能让人发胖吗?
Does the Foreman Grill really knock out the fat?

234
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:03,559
没有资金来源我真能贷款吗?
Can I really get a loan with no money down?

235
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:04,510
你是我亲妈吗?
Are you my real mother?

236
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,762
妈妈 我要答案
Momma, I want answers.

237
00:10:07,447 --> 00:10:10,029
Tonya 和妈妈跟你说过的一样
Tonya, like Mommy told you,

238
00:10:10,058 --> 00:10:11,553
有圣诞老人的存在
there is a Santa Claus.

239
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:15,254
那为什么楼上的房间里 堆满了礼物?
So how come there's a room upstairs full of presents?

240
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:16,958
谁告诉你的?
Who told you that?

241
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,210
Drew带我去看的
Drew showed me.

242
00:10:18,313 --> 00:10:19,518
Drew 给我过来!
Drew, get in here!

243
00:10:21,665 --> 00:10:22,665
啥事 妈妈?
Yes, Mom?

244
00:10:22,766 --> 00:10:25,043
你带Tonya上楼看礼物了?
Did you show Tonya the presents upstairs?

245
00:10:25,971 --> 00:10:26,971
对呀
Yeah.

246
00:10:27,577 --> 00:10:28,577
我们得聊聊
We need to talk.

247
00:10:30,636 --> 00:10:32,099
呃...呃...不
Uh... uh... no.

248
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,801
等等 妈妈 不 不
Hold  on, Momma. No, no.

249
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:36,635
<i>我老妈整天都喊着要揍我们</i>
<i>My mother talked about beating us all the time,</i>

250
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:40,580
<i>但她真正要揍我们 只是在她说要"聊聊"的时候</i>
<i>but the only time she ever beat us is when she said she wanted to talk.</i>

251
00:10:40,694 --> 00:10:43,305
<i>那一晚她把Drew聊了个底儿掉</i>
<i>And she talked the hell out of Drew that night.</i>

252
00:10:50,687 --> 00:10:53,904
哦不错嘛 这些是什么东西?
Oh... well, what's all this stuff?

253
00:10:54,426 --> 00:10:55,870
从我老师那儿得到的
I got it from  my teacher.

254
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:59,416
她觉得我们是处在 下层社会 饥饿状态
She thinks that we're underprivileged and starving.

255
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:00,930
哦 不
Oh, no.

256
00:11:01,084 --> 00:11:02,084
嗯嗯
Mm-mmm.

257
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:03,542
绝对不行
Absolutely not.

258
00:11:04,153 --> 00:11:08,239
我绝对不能 让那些人认为我们没的吃
I'm not going to have them people thinking that we don't have anything to eat.

259
00:11:08,369 --> 00:11:10,466
<i>她还没有尊严到 把那些橄榄放回去</i>
<i>She wasn't too proud to take those olives.</i>

260
00:11:10,478 --> 00:11:11,417
你去哪?
Where you going?

261
00:11:11,452 --> 00:11:13,220
我去往这里再装点吃的
I'm taking this to put some more food in it,

262
00:11:13,249 --> 00:11:15,286
明天你把它带回学校去
'cause you're taking this back to school tomorrow.

263
00:11:15,321 --> 00:11:18,410
<i>我老妈很生气有人 认为我们需要施舍</i>
<i>My mother was so upset about people thinking we needed charity,</i>

264
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:21,609
<i>这使她几乎忘了没给我礼物 带来的罪恶感</i>
<i>she almost forgot she felt guilty about not getting me a gift.</i>

265
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:22,776
Chris 稍等片刻
Chris, wait a minute.

266
00:11:22,867 --> 00:11:25,410

267
00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:27,724
我知道这些不是你的错
I know all of this is not your fault.

280

妈妈 Tonya打了我两下

296
00:12:59,425 --> 00:13:00,425
啊...不是
Hmm... no.

297
00:13:00,936 --> 00:13:03,317
应该是玉米粉做的 怎么问这个?
I think it's made of cornmeal. Why?

298

299
00:13:05,673 --> 00:13:08,397
怎么你想让圣诞老人送你玉米面包?
Why, you want Santa Claus to bring you some cornbread for Christmas?

放过你们妹妹吧

Drew 你相信“复活节兔子” 在Tonya这么大时候
Drew, you believed in the Easter Bunny till you was about her age, and Chris,

Chris你呢 差点弄掉所有牙
you damn near lost all your teeth before

306
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,761
直到你不相信"牙仙"
you stopped believing in the Tooth Fairy.

307
00:13:23,993 --> 00:13:26,604
连复活节兔子和牙仙也不存在?
There's no Easter Bunny or Tooth Fairy, either?

308
00:13:27,246 --> 00:13:28,196

最好有人把牙还我
Somebody better give me my teeth back.

宝贝 我不是这意思!
Baby, I didn't mean it!

312
00:13:34,354 --> 00:13:35,354
我不是这意思!
I didn't mean it!

313
00:13:35,394 --> 00:13:36,505
Julius!
Julius!

我要我的牙!
I want my teeth back!

315
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:40,019
宝贝 不...
Baby, no...

316
00:13:40,283 --> 00:13:41,458
- Tonya! - 我们在开玩笑!
- Tonya! - We were joking!

317

是个玩笑!
It's a joke!

320
00:13:47,944 --> 00:13:50,499
就是她 她说圣诞老人不来咱家
That's her. She said Santa can't come to our house,

321
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,320
因为我们有的只是暖炉
'cause all we have is space heaters.

322
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,165
而圣诞老人不会从暖炉下来
And Santa can't come through a space heater.

323
00:13:54,195 --> 00:13:55,970
你怎么养孩子的?
What kind of children are you raising?

324
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,917
这孩子满城跑 破坏别人美梦
This girl's going around town crushing dreams.

325
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,601
- 我... - 是你教她这样的吗?
- I... - Is that what you want her to be?

00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,076
- 破坏美梦者? - 不是 可你...!
- A dream crusher? - No, but you...!

327

得管管这孩子
That girl needs to be stopped.

328
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:05,810
Tonya!
Tonya!

329
00:14:06,154 --> 00:14:07,265
这是事实!
It's the truth!

330
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:11,022
<i>通常情况下 我妈会把Tonya打得头发出油</i>
<i>Normally, my mama would smack the grease out of Tonya's hair.</i>

331
00:14:11,023 --> 00:14:13,745
<i>但老妈不能因为讲真话打她</i>
<i>But she couldn't smack her for telling the truth.</i>

332
00:14:13,995 --> 00:14:15,129
那是什么?
What's that?

333
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:17,378
我妈让我把这些东西拎回来
My mom made me bring all this stuff back.

334
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:19,823
证明我们有能力捐食物
It proves that we can afford to donate food.

335
00:14:20,189 --> 00:14:22,244
嘿 看看 我有东西送你

337
00:14:24,289 --> 00:14:25,941

"电脑游戏"（歌曲专辑）

339
00:14:29,652 --> 00:14:31,503
- 谁的歌? - George Clinton (黑人老歌手 发型怪异)

340
00:14:31,766 --> 00:14:33,701
里面有首歌 "电子狗"
There's a song on there, "Atomic Dog",

341
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,578
我在广播里听过 很有趣的
I heard on the radio. It's really funny.

- 你觉得我会喜欢? - 不知道
- You think I'll like it? - I don't know.

343
00:14:37,661 --> 00:14:40,292
有一天你得到你的随身听时 至少你会有一盘磁带
When you finally do get your Walkman, at least you'll have a tape.

344
00:14:40,322 --> 00:14:42,710
<i>我一直很欣赏 Greg的乐观精神</i>
<i>I always liked that Greg was so optimistic.</i>

345
00:14:42,752 --> 00:14:46,307
<i>时至今日 他还是认为 Al B.Sure(歌手)会重返乐坛</i>
<i>To this day, he still thinks Al B. Sure's gonna make a comeback.</i>

346
00:14:50,461 --> 00:14:52,183
可如果圣诞老人不存在
But if Santa Claus is not real,

347
00:14:52,716 --> 00:14:54,104
为什么人们要编造一个呢?
why do people make it up?

348
00:14:55,017 --> 00:14:59,089
Tonya 圣诞老人只是一种方式 来教导孩子懂得给予
Tonya, Santa is just a way to teach kids about the spirit of giving.

349
00:15:00,231 --> 00:15:02,297
他只是一种 象征 仅此而已
He's just a... symbol, that's all.

350
00:15:02,731 --> 00:15:03,731
哦
Oh.

351
00:15:05,386 --> 00:15:06,386
Tonya
Tonya...

352
00:15:06,632 --> 00:15:09,689
你是大姑娘了 到了了解真相的岁数
you're a big girl, and, now that you're old enough to know

353
00:15:09,744 --> 00:15:13,983
为别的孩子不破坏这个秘密 是你的责任 好吗?
the truth, it's your responsibility to not spoil it for other kids, okay?

354
00:15:14,349 --> 00:15:17,200
因为你想给他们一些东西来信仰
Because you want to give them something to believe in.

355
00:15:17,255 --> 00:15:18,452
完全正确
Exactly.

356
00:15:19,101 --> 00:15:20,156
这才是我的好闺女
That's my big girl.

357

晚安 妈妈
Good night, Mommy.

361
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:31,935
<i>你觉得向Tonya 解释圣诞老人很困难</i>
<i>You think explaining Santa Claus to Tonya was hard,</i>

362
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:34,490
<i>那你真该看看 跟她解释两性关系时的状况</i>
<i>you should have been there for the birds and the bees.</i>

363
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,918
呦 真恶心!
Eww... that's nasty!

<i>圣诞节前夕似乎无人睡眠</i>
<i>Nobody  ever seems to get any sleep on Christmas Eve.</i>

<i>Everybody's up for different reasons.</i>

366

我们聊过这些了
We talked about this.

369
00:15:56,803 --> 00:15:59,235
是聊过 但这不是为圣诞老人准备的
We did... and they're not for Santa.

370
00:15:59,764 --> 00:16:00,764
是给您的
They're for you.

371
00:16:02,663 --> 00:16:03,762
谢谢 宝贝
Thank you, baby.

372
00:16:08,518 --> 00:16:10,315
<i>但既然知道我什么礼物都没有</i>
<i>But since I wasn't getting anything,</i>

373
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,970
<i>我就没这些问题了</i>
<i>I didn't have that problem.</i>

374
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,417
圣诞节的早上 我甚至把时间花在下楼上
On Christmas morning, I even took my time going downstairs.

375
00:16:28,261 --> 00:16:30,332
现在Tonya知道了没有圣诞老人
Now that Tonya knew there wasn't a Santa Claus,

376
00:16:30,362 --> 00:16:32,695
她的抱怨直冲着老妈就来了
her complaints went directly to my mother.

377
00:16:32,816 --> 00:16:35,982
妈妈 我要的是长发的揶菜娃娃
Mama, I wanted a Cabbage Patch Doll with long hair.

378
00:16:36,376 --> 00:16:38,598
给你来个没头发的空气娃娃怎么样?
How about you have no doll with no hair?

379
00:16:38,876 --> 00:16:39,876

They were giving those away at the doctor's office I deliver papers to.

384
00:16:51,082 --> 00:16:52,676

392
00:17:06,824 --> 00:17:07,824
不知
No.

393
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,247
除非你们有这日历?
What if you had a calendar?

394
00:17:09,277 --> 00:17:10,126
看到没?
See?

395
00:17:10,127 --> 00:17:12,385
明年你们全都得要日历
All y'all should ask for calendars next year.

396
00:17:12,386 --> 00:17:13,441
好主意
That's a good idea.

397
00:17:13,586 --> 00:17:16,469
嘿 Chris待会想和我出去骑车吗?
Hey, Chris, you want to go ride my bike with me outside later?
