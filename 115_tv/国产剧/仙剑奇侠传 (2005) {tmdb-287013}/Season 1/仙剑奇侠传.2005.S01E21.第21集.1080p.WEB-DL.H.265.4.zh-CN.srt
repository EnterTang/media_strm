00:00:08,031 --> 00:00:09,054
在布鲁克林成长的我
<i>Growing up in Brooklyn,</i>

2
00:00:09,101 --> 00:00:12,121
一直以为去远方旅行...
<i>I always thought that traveling to faraway places was something</i>

3
00:00:12,168 --> 00:00:13,729
只能是有钱人的消遣
<i>that only rich people did.</i>

4
00:00:14,636 --> 00:00:16,953
都13岁 俺还没出过纽约州
<i>At 13, I'd never been out of New York,</i>

5
00:00:17,268 --> 00:00:19,209
但情况即将改变
<i>but all that was about to change.</i>

6
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,686
同学们 我要宣布一件事
Class, I have an announcement.

7
00:00:22,228 --> 00:00:25,169
我们要到华盛顿特区来一场实地考察旅行
We're all going on a field trip to Washington, DC.

8
00:00:27,638 --> 00:00:30,787
你们只需让父母在许可卡上签个字
You just need to have your parents sign your permission slips

9
00:00:30,844 --> 00:00:34,813
并要卖30盒饼干来补充旅行费用
and sell 30 boxes of cookies to cover the cost of the trip.

10
00:00:35,998 --> 00:00:36,998
Chris
Chris.

11
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,493
如果你家付不起现金
If your people can't afford to pay cash,

12
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,465
我可以考虑收取粮票
I'll see if we'll accept food stamps.

13
00:00:41,505 --> 00:00:42,966
她当这是鱼子酱啊
<i>She acts like it's caviar.</i>

14
00:00:42,995 --> 00:00:44,392
这只是饼干 该死的
<i>It's just cookies, damn.</i>

15
00:00:44,941 --> 00:00:46,467
我们怎么去?
How are we going to get there?

16
00:00:46,526 --> 00:00:47,961
我们租了一辆公车
We're chartering a bus.

17
00:00:49,231 --> 00:00:51,623
准备坐最后吧 乡巴佬
Prepare to sit in the back, Birmingham.

18
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:54,111
我倒希望你坐公车下面
<i>I'd like to sit you under a bus.</i>

宝贝 你用不着给我买东西!
Oh, baby, you didn't have to get me anything!

没错 他以前是没买
<i>Oh, yes, he did.</i>

26
00:01:39,876 --> 00:01:41,993
不过他可是吃一堑 长一智
<i>My father learned that the hard way.</i>

27
00:01:42,532 --> 00:01:45,532
是你说的不用给你买东西啊!
You're the one that told me not to get you nothing!

28

42
00:02:12,977 --> 00:02:15,800

<i>My father has gotten tickets from Risky before--</i>

43
00:02:16,031 --> 00:02:19,031

<i>for the Ali-Frazier fight at Madison Square Garden.</i>

44
00:02:19,802 --> 00:02:20,802

45

谁被击倒了? 怎么了?
Who's down? What happened?

00:02:27,633 --> 00:02:29,361
她扔鞋了吗?
Did she throw her shoe yet?

50
00:02:29,865 --> 00:02:31,051
我接到Patti的鞋了!

No, baby, I don't think these are bites.

60
00:02:54,749 --> 00:02:56,101
你长水痘了
You've got chicken pox.

61
00:02:57,432 --> 00:02:58,912
谁传的她?
Who gave her chicken pox?

62
00:02:58,997 --> 00:02:59,997

要我拿点止咳糖浆吗?
Want me to get the Robitussin?

64
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,458

65
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,294
听着 Chris Drew

I don't need y'all getting sick, so I need y'all to stay away from Tonya.

67
00:03:09,839 --> 00:03:11,967
这听起来像让我们远离一个连环杀人
<i>That's like saying stay away from a serial killer.</i>

68
00:03:11,968 --> 00:03:12,968
好的

很抱歉 Chris
Oh, I'm sorry, Chris,

76
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,707
我不能再去卖东西了
but I can't ask these people to buy nothing else.

77
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,531
我帮你妈妈卖过雅芳化妆品
I've sold Avon for your mother,

我要买两盒 让你开张
I'll buy two boxes for myself to get you started.

83
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,387
其他的 你要自己处理
The rest, you're gonna have to handle yourself.

84
00:03:44,388 --> 00:03:45,388
谢谢你 爸爸
Thanks, Dad.

85
00:03:47,036 --> 00:03:49,859
Bed-Stuy至少住了10万人
<i>With at least 100,000 people living in Bed-Stuy,</i>

86
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:52,880
卖掉28盒饼干应该不是啥难事
<i>selling 28 boxes of cookies couldn't be that hard.</i>

87
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:55,819
有人在吗?
Hello?

88
00:03:57,569 --> 00:03:58,745
她说她满18岁了!
She said she was 18!

89
00:04:07,352 --> 00:04:08,352
嘿!

你想买...
Would you like to buy...

91
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:13,779
别在意
Never mind.

92
00:04:16,428 --> 00:04:18,486
想买饼干吗?
Would you like to buy some cookies?

93
00:04:18,534 --> 00:04:19,534
我要四盒
I'll take four.

94
00:04:20,659 --> 00:04:21,898

他有糖尿病

96
00:04:23,687 --> 00:04:25,039
你想杀了他吗?
You trying to kill him?

97
00:04:26,355 --> 00:04:29,676
难以想象卖个饼干比卖个毒品还麻烦
<i>I can't believe it's harder selling cookies than crack.</i>

98
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,921
妈妈告诉过我们离Tonya远点
<i>My mother told us to stay away from Tonya,</i>

99
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,805
但对Drew来说还是太迟了
<i>but it was too late for Drew.</i>

100
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:36,917
你这样会越来越严重 孩子
You're gonna make it worse, boy.

101
00:04:37,023 --> 00:04:38,158
别抓了
Stop scratching.

102
00:04:38,387 --> 00:04:41,099
为什么她不说别长头发了?
<i>Why don't she just tell him to stop growing hair?</i>

103
00:04:41,122 --> 00:04:42,269
好痒
But it itches.

104
00:04:42,359 --> 00:04:43,557
去坐那
Sit  over here.

Let me see.

108
00:04:51,436 --> 00:04:53,937
宝贝 你不能抓 轻轻拍拍
See,  baby, you can't scratch, you got to pat.

109
00:04:53,938 --> 00:04:55,537
怎样? 是不是感觉好些?
See? Does that feel better?

110
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:56,452
嗯
Yes.

111
00:04:56,499 --> 00:04:58,274

让我看看
Let me see.

113
00:05:00,648 --> 00:05:02,765
100度 不是很糟
Ooh, 100 degrees, that's not so bad.

114
00:05:02,951 --> 00:05:04,297
躺这休息一会
Here, lay down, get some rest.

115
00:05:04,298 --> 00:05:05,597
我过会再来看你
I'll come check on you later.

116
00:05:05,598 --> 00:05:07,842
别抓了 你让我都痒了
And stop scratching. You're making me itch.

117
00:05:13,108 --> 00:05:14,108
找到保姆了吗?
You find anyone?

118
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,124
没人想照看生水痘的孩子
Nobody wants to baby-sit kids with chicken pox.

119
00:05:17,269 --> 00:05:19,513
那算了吧 梦女郎演唱会
Well, there goes Dreamgirls.

120
00:05:20,273 --> 00:05:21,926
无论怎样 谢谢你 宝贝 你知道吗?

121
00:05:21,927 --> 00:05:25,082
这是你给我的最好的礼物
This would have been the best present you ever gave me.

122
00:05:25,106 --> 00:05:27,462
这可不是第一次 因为我们之中有人生病
<i>It wouldn't be the first time my parents missed something</i>

123
00:05:27,498 --> 00:05:28,922
而耽误父母出行

我拿到了免费用餐券!

125

126
00:05:33,088 --> 00:05:34,545
妈妈 我得了狂犬病

127
00:05:36,143 --> 00:05:37,143

妈妈 我眼球掉出来了

131

我们赢了一次去迈阿密的旅行!
We just won a trip to Miami!

133
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:47,874
我马上收拾行李!
Ooh, I'm gonna go get packed!

134
00:05:48,018 --> 00:05:49,665
妈妈 我脖子扭了
Ma, I think I broke my neck.

135
00:05:50,687 --> 00:05:51,687

139
00:05:57,211 --> 00:05:58,347

At least we'll be together.

140
00:05:58,348 --> 00:05:59,348
你知道吗?
You know what?

141
00:05:59,598 --> 00:06:01,245
这票很贵
These tickets are expensive.

142
00:06:02,305 --> 00:06:05,257
我们不必都在家坐着
There's no reason why both of us should sit at home.

143
00:06:05,258 --> 00:06:07,153
我来看孩子 你去看演唱会
I'll watch the kids. You go.

144
00:06:07,265 --> 00:06:08,265
好的
Okay.

145
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,463
要是她怀里有个球 她肯定去纽卡斯尔联队打比赛了
If she had a ball, she could have played for the Jets.

146
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,365
Sheila!
Sheila!

147
00:06:12,365 --> 00:06:14,136
我们可以去看梦女郎了!
We're going to see Dreamgirls!

148
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:16,168
没错
That's right.

149
00:06:16,425 --> 00:06:19,542
当你想让女人拆穿你的谎言时 她们却从不那样做
Women never catch you in a lie when you want them to.

150
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:20,827
一会见
Okay.

151
00:06:21,155 --> 00:06:27,405
*And I am telling you I'm not going*
And I am telling you I'm not going

152
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:31,498
*You're the best man I've ever known*
You're the best man I've ever known

153
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:35,353
*And there's no way I could ever ever go*
And there's no way I could ever, ever go

154
00:06:35,558 --> 00:06:37,766
*Darling there's no way*
Darling, there's no way

155
00:06:38,492 --> 00:06:39,924
*No...*
No...

156
00:06:41,817 --> 00:06:43,697
*I'm living without ya*
I'm living without ya

157
00:06:43,977 --> 00:06:46,420
*I'm not living without ya*
I'm not living without ya

158
00:06:46,528 --> 00:06:48,420
*Not living without ya*
Not living without ya

159
00:06:48,778 --> 00:06:50,581
*I don't want to be*
I don't want to be

160
00:06:50,728 --> 00:06:52,426
*Free-e-e-e-e-e*
Free-e-e-e-e-e

161
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,763
*I'm staying*

163
00:06:56,692 --> 00:06:59,592
*And you you you*
And you, you, you

164
00:06:59,828 --> 00:07:02,975
*You're gonna love me...*
You're gonna love me...

165
00:07:06,223 --> 00:07:07,650
Jennifer 我来了
Jennifer, I'm coming!

166
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:10,599
爸爸
Daddy,

167
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:12,419
能帮我抓抓屁股吗?
can you scratch my booty?

168
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:15,009
拜托
Please?

169
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:23,518
伙计 你得加把劲了
Dude, you got to pull it together.

170
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:25,419
这可是今年最棒的郊游了
This is the best field trip all year.

171
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,243
我可能会见到Tip O'Neill
I might get to see Tip O'Neill.

172
00:07:27,521 --> 00:07:28,521
谁?
Who?

173
00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:30,678
你没听说过Thomas Tip O'Neill?
You've never heard of Thomas Tip O'Neill?

174
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:32,855
除非他和大鲨鱼奥尼尔有关
<i>Not unless he's related to Shaquille.</i>

175
00:07:32,965 --> 00:07:36,135
他是有史以来 众议院最著名发言人
He's only like the most famous Speaker of the House of Representatives ever.

176
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,688
我不知道还能做什么
Well, I don't know what else I can do.

177
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:39,338
我已经敲了快100扇门了
I knocked on, like, 100 doors.

178
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:41,907
你最好再敲100扇 小奥尼尔
Well, you better knock on 100 more, Jermaine,

179
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,167
如果我没在去往特区的公车上
'cause if I'm not on that bus to DC,

180
00:07:44,348 --> 00:07:46,877
我就把你的脸揍开花
I'm gonna freedom march all over your face.

181
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:54,009
算上卖给我爸爸的那两盒饼干
<i>Counting the two boxes of  cookies I had sold to my dad,</i>

182
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:57,010
我一共才卖了两盒 还被偷了一盒
<i>I had sold two boxes of cookies and had one stolen.</i>

183
00:07:57,339 --> 00:07:58,890
我得想个新点子
<i>I needed a new strategy.</i>

184
00:07:59,134 --> 00:08:01,506
打扰下 想来盒饼干吗?
Excuse me. would you like to buy a box of cookies?

185
00:08:01,588 --> 00:08:03,630
它们能喝吗?
Can I get drunk on those cookies?

186
00:08:08,845 --> 00:08:10,703
嗨 Risky 想来盒饼干吗?
Hey, Risky, you want to buy a box of cookies?

187
00:08:10,704 --> 00:08:12,880
嘿 小朋友 俺管卖不管买
Hey, youngblood, I don't buy, I sell.

188
00:08:12,929 --> 00:08:14,210
想来个VCR吗?
You want to buy a VCR?

189
00:08:14,211 --> 00:08:15,211
不 谢谢
No, thanks.

190
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:17,079
嘿 要买VCR吗?
Hey. You need a VCR?

191
00:08:17,224 --> 00:08:18,282
我已经有一个了
I got one already.

192
00:08:18,324 --> 00:08:19,656
这可是今早从卡车上掉下来的
Fell off the truck this morning.

193
00:08:19,691 --> 00:08:21,377
真的吗? 我来两个
Really? I'll take two.

194
00:08:21,476 --> 00:08:24,536
真没想到这街区唯一能卖出去的
<i>I never realized the only stuff that sold on the street</i>

195
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:26,654
竟是偷来的东西
<i>in my neighborhood was stolen stuff.</i>

196
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:29,070
饼干!  卖饼干!
Cookies!  Cookies for sale!

197
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:32,068
巧克力曲奇 花生酱口味 巧克力人偶 薄荷巧克力口味
Chocolate chip, peanut butter, Do-Si-Do, chocolate mint!

198
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,200
我买完了
I got cookies.

199
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,070
这可是今早从卡车上掉下来的
They just fell off the truck this morning.

200
00:08:37,255 --> 00:08:38,700
你怎么不早说?
Why didn't you say so?

201
00:08:39,354 --> 00:08:40,412
我要两盒
Give me two boxes.

202
00:08:53,581 --> 00:08:54,720
谢谢
Thank you.

203
00:09:06,152 --> 00:09:08,843
我都等不及要回学校了
<i>I couldn't wait to get back to school.</i>

204
00:09:09,523 --> 00:09:11,226
你就是卖饼干的那小子?
You the kid selling the cookies?

205
00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:12,505
刚从卡车上掉下来的
Right off the truck.

206
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,187
你来几盒?
How  many you want?

207
00:09:14,277 --> 00:09:15,277
一盒都不要
None.

208
00:09:15,412 --> 00:09:16,810
你被捕了
You're under arrest.

209
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:31,152
有关被捕 我只在电视上看到过
<i>All I knew about getting arrested was what I saw on TV.</i>

210
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,432
他们告诉你你的权力...
<i>They read you your rights...</i>

211
00:09:32,455 --> 00:09:33,954
你有权保持缄默
You have the right to remain silent.

212
00:09:33,982 --> 00:09:35,209
你可以打一个电话...
<i>...and you get a phone call...</i>

213
00:09:35,244 --> 00:09:36,231
你可以打一个电话
You get one call.

214
00:09:36,569 --> 00:09:38,039
伙食很差
<i>and the food is horrible.</i>

215
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,369
谢谢
Thanks.

216
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,828
我发现 被逮捕后最惨的就是...
<i>What I found out was that the worst part of getting arrested</i>

217
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:44,728
被当成犯人对待
<i>is being treated like a criminal.</i>

218
00:09:44,729 --> 00:09:46,469
对不起 我能去下厕所吗?
Excuse me, can I use the bathroom?

219
00:09:46,516 --> 00:09:48,318
你卖赃物之前应该考虑到
Should have thought about using the bathroom

220
00:09:48,341 --> 00:09:50,138
去厕所的问题
before you started selling stolen goods.

221
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:51,903
我没卖赃物
I wasn't selling stolen goods.

222
00:09:52,288 --> 00:09:54,405
那我们抓错人了?
Then we must have got the wrong guy.

223
00:09:55,249 --> 00:09:57,131
我不能打个电话吗?
Don't I get, like, a phone call?

224
00:09:57,606 --> 00:09:59,508
你卖赃物之前应该考虑到
Should have thought about making a phone call

225
00:09:59,543 --> 00:10:01,600
打电话的问题
before you started selling stolen goods.

226
00:10:01,716 --> 00:10:03,618
我知道我表面上看来很平静
<i>I know I looked cool on the outside,</i>

227
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:05,944
但我心里... 是这么想的...
<i>but on the inside, I was doing this...</i>

228
00:10:06,202 --> 00:10:08,856
我再也不这么干了 我保证!
I won't do it anymore, I promise!

229
00:10:09,044 --> 00:10:10,213
我不是小偷!
I'm not a thief!

230
00:10:11,082 --> 00:10:12,374
我要见妈妈!
I want my mama!

231
00:10:12,977 --> 00:10:15,220
我想了一个又一个
<i>All I was thinking was one way or another,</i>

232
00:10:15,318 --> 00:10:17,290
希望能被放出去的办法
<i>I wish they'd let me go.</i>

233
00:10:17,461 --> 00:10:20,587
而在家里... 爸爸也在考虑同样的事
<i>Back at home, my father was thinking the same thing.</i>

234
00:10:20,983 --> 00:10:21,983
我看起来怎样?
How do I look?

235
00:10:24,748 --> 00:10:26,615
你已经换了5次了
You changed five times already.

236
00:10:26,955 --> 00:10:28,450
第一次就挺好了
You looked fine the first time.

237
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:31,030
谢谢 宝贝 我只是太激动了
Oh, thank you, baby. I'm just so excited.

238
00:10:31,158 --> 00:10:32,746
我是说 要见梦女郎了
I mean, this is Dreamgirls.

239
00:10:32,874 --> 00:10:34,142
梦女郎!
Dreamgirls!

240
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,662
这就像是终身不遇二次的事
This is like a once-in-a-lifetime thing.

241
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,561
正是一生难得的机会
It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

242
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:42,633
- 是的 - 所以 你最好赶快出发
- Yeah. - So, uh, you better get going.

243
00:10:43,429 --> 00:10:44,546
没错 宝贝
You're right, baby.

244
00:10:45,099 --> 00:10:47,740
你对我太好了
Oh, you are so good to me.

245
00:10:49,502 --> 00:10:50,700
梦女郎
D reamgirls.

246
00:10:50,936 --> 00:10:53,333
*We'll make you happy*
We'll make you happy.

247
00:10:53,388 --> 00:10:54,886
*Yeah yeah yeah*
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

248
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,574
爸爸 痒死我了
Daddy, I'm itchy!

249
00:11:06,655 --> 00:11:09,082
过来 去站到那组人里
Come on, I need to put you in a lineup.

250
00:11:09,242 --> 00:11:10,242
那组人?
A lineup?

251
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,846
没错 很明显 前几天在卑尔根东
Yeah, apparently a delivery truck carrying cookies

252
00:11:12,847 --> 00:11:14,996
有辆运饼干的卡车被抢劫了
was hijacked in East Bergen the other day.

253
00:11:15,031 --> 00:11:18,973
我猜你可能在想 谁会去拦一辆运饼干的卡车?
<i>I know you're probably thinking who would hold up a cookie truck?</i>

254
00:11:19,288 --> 00:11:20,345
别动! 别动!
Don't move! Don't move!

255
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,446
把所有的饼干都交出来! 觉得我在开玩笑?
All we want are your cookies! Think I'm playing?

256
00:11:22,493 --> 00:11:23,611
走啦!
Now, go!

257
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:25,904
- 我这么做不会被判刑的... - 快跑!
- I'm not doing time for this-- - Go!

258
00:11:26,721 --> 00:11:27,968
我没抢劫卡车
I didn't hijack a truck.

259
00:11:27,969 --> 00:11:29,870
我连卑尔根东在哪都不知道
I don't even know where East Bergen is.

260
00:11:29,871 --> 00:11:33,988
你卖赃物之前应该考虑到这些问题
Should have thought of that before you started selling stolen cookies.

261
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:36,780
我不会在那里洗澡的 太恶心了
I ain't taking a bath in that. That looks nasty.

262
00:11:37,523 --> 00:11:38,979
这样可以缓解瘙痒
It'll help your itching.

263
00:11:39,038 --> 00:11:40,588
可是我不喜欢麦片
But I don't like oatmeal.

264
00:11:40,989 --> 00:11:43,623
没让你吃它们 孩子 只是在那里洗澡
You don't have to eat it, girl, you got to take a bath in it.

265
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,938
然后她得把它们吃了
<i>Then she's got to eat it.</i>

266
00:11:44,969 --> 00:11:46,448
我爸爸从不浪费食物
<i>My father didn't waste food.</i>

267
00:11:46,844 --> 00:11:49,580
不是我偷的 我在Corleone中学读书
It wasn't me. I go to Corleone Junior High.

268
00:11:49,673 --> 00:11:50,952
我从学校拿的饼干
I got the cookies from school,

269
00:11:50,953 --> 00:11:54,106
我得把它们都卖了 才能去华盛顿特区野外郊游
and I'm just selling them so I can go on some trip to Washington, DC.

270
00:11:54,107 --> 00:11:55,577
这不是偷来的
And I did not steal them.

271
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:58,091
我只有那么说 人们才会来买
I was just saying that so people would want to buy them.

272
00:11:58,138 --> 00:11:59,477
你在Corleone上学?
You go to Corleone?

273
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:01,679
你是那唯一一个黑人孩子吧?
What are you the only black kid there?

274
00:12:01,767 --> 00:12:02,767
不错的尝试
Nice try.

275
00:12:02,962 --> 00:12:06,382
你符合那个目击证人的描述 饼干小子
There was an eyewitness, and you fit the profile, cookie boy.

276
00:12:06,471 --> 00:12:08,044
即使只有13岁
<i>I may have only been 13,</i>

277
00:12:08,118 --> 00:12:10,467
我已经明白什么是种族歧视了
<i>but I already knew how racial profiling worked.</i>

278
00:12:10,986 --> 00:12:12,407
目击证人说...

and he had on dark pants, and size 14 dark shoes.

284
00:12:25,805 --> 00:12:28,805
他左手腕背面有块胎记
And, uh, a birthmark on the back of his left wrist.

285
00:12:28,937 --> 00:12:30,806
还有 他走路有点跛
Oh, and- and he walked with a limp.

286
00:12:30,896 --> 00:12:32,869
但这些是警察听来的...
But this is what the cop heard...

287
00:12:32,962 --> 00:12:34,994
他特征是黑的 黑黑的男人

295
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,027
没错 还有 他和一个黑人在一起
Yeah. And, uh, he walked with a black.

296
00:12:48,156 --> 00:12:49,384
脸朝前
Face forward.

297
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:52,549
2号 站好!
Number two, stand still!

298
00:12:53,146 --> 00:12:56,245
看起来就像Commodores最新专辑的封面
That looks like the cover of the last Commodores album.

299
00:12:56,246 --> 00:12:58,849
通常 爸爸会盼着妈妈高兴
<i>Usually, my father wanted my mother to be happy.</i>

300
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:01,153
但这次 他偷偷祈祷
<i>But this was the one time he was secretly hoping</i>

301
00:13:01,154 --> 00:13:04,683
Risky给他的票 能像往常一样烂
<i>that the tickets that Risky gave him were horrible as usual.</i>

302
00:13:13,071 --> 00:13:14,268
天啊!
Oh, my God!

303
00:13:14,349 --> 00:13:15,417
这座位棒极了!
These seats are great!

304
00:13:15,453 --> 00:13:17,089
- 没错! - 亲爱的 虽然我不想这么说
- I know! - Oh, girl, I hate to say it,

305
00:13:17,136 --> 00:13:19,203
但你的孩子长水痘了 真是太好了
but I'm glad your kids got the chicken pox. Oh!

306
00:13:19,238 --> 00:13:20,424
结婚纪念日快乐
Happy anniversary.

307
00:13:20,435 --> 00:13:21,508
谢谢
Oh, thank you,

308
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:25,429
我们爱你!
We love you!

309
00:13:25,734 --> 00:13:27,543
别走! 继续!
Don't go! You stay!

310
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:29,163
你最好不要走!
You better go, girl!

311
00:13:29,515 --> 00:13:30,790
*我会留下来!*
I'm staying!

312
00:13:31,493 --> 00:13:32,493
嘿
Hey.

313
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,099
Chris回来了吗?
Is Chris here yet?

314
00:13:34,443 --> 00:13:36,972
没有 我猜他还在外面卖饼干
No, I guess he's still out selling cookies.

315
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,800
好的
Okay.

316
00:13:38,877 --> 00:13:41,097
嘿 爸爸 能给我腋窝上点药吗
Hey, dad? Can you get my armpit?

317
00:13:46,342 --> 00:13:48,697
那么...妈妈什么时候回来?
So, uh, when's mom coming home?

318
00:13:49,636 --> 00:13:50,904
得再过一会
It'll be a while.

319
00:13:51,011 --> 00:13:53,864
她还拿走了我的优惠卷 和Sheila一起去吃晚餐了
She's using my coupon to take Sheila to dinner, too.

320
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:58,071
在你们的结婚纪念日里 她怎么能和其他人出去玩
How come she's going out with somebody else on your anniversary?

321
00:13:58,118 --> 00:13:59,220
呃...
Well...

322
00:13:59,568 --> 00:14:00,568
我让她去的
I told her to go.

323
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,028
你为什么要这么做?
Why'd you do that?

324
00:14:03,546 --> 00:14:05,718
因为我想让你妈妈开心
Because I want your mother to be happy.

325
00:14:05,815 --> 00:14:08,991
如果换作我 必须在家陪着病人
Well, if I had to stay at home and be with sick people

326
00:14:09,073 --> 00:14:12,073
而有人却出去玩 我会生气的
while somebody else was out having fun, I'd be mad.

327
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:14,737
我没生气呀
Well, I'm not mad.

328
00:14:14,981 --> 00:14:15,978
我会的
I would be.

329
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:17,148
也会很伤心
I'd be sad, too.

330
00:14:17,932 --> 00:14:20,100
会因为她离开我而感到沮丧
Be kind of depressed because she left me.

331
00:14:20,189 --> 00:14:22,154
- 是的... - 我会大哭 等等
- Yeah... - I'd be crying and everything.

332
00:14:22,242 --> 00:14:23,455
我会很难过
Man, I'd be so upset.

333
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:25,842
- 好了 我们该... - 我没感到你在抑制自己
- You know, let's get... - I don't see how you hold it in.

334
00:14:25,843 --> 00:14:26,843
来吧
Here you go.

335
00:14:26,998 --> 00:14:28,292
坐好别动
Sit tight, don't move.

336
00:14:28,848 --> 00:14:29,848
我过会儿回来
I'll be back.

337
00:14:39,568 --> 00:14:40,719
嘿 Russo
Hey, Russo,

338
00:14:40,763 --> 00:14:42,410
这孩子的事查清了
the kid's storry checks out.

339
00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:44,705
看来你说的是真话
Looks like you were telling the truth.

340
00:14:44,706 --> 00:14:46,706
你的老师证明了
Your teacher confirmed your story.

341
00:14:46,862 --> 00:14:48,077
- 谢谢 - 没错
- Thank you. - Oh, yeah.

342
00:14:48,171 --> 00:14:51,353
她还说了 你为你的同胞争了光
She also said to tell you you're a credit to your race.

343
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,711
我可以走了吗?
Can I leave now?

344
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,431
当然 等到你父母来接你
Sure-- soon as your parents come get you.

345
00:14:57,024 --> 00:14:58,024
我父母?
My parents?

346
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:00,964
不能直接放我走吗? 我不能告诉妈妈我被捕了
Can't you just let me go? I can't tell my mom I got arrested.

347
00:15:01,082 --> 00:15:03,015
告诉别人你卖的是赃物之前
Should have thought of that before you started

348
00:15:03,073 --> 00:15:05,333
你应该考虑到这个问题
telling people you were selling stolen goods.

349
00:15:09,595 --> 00:15:10,595
喂
Hello?

350
00:15:10,644 --> 00:15:11,644
喂 爸爸
Hi, Dad.

351
00:15:11,698 --> 00:15:14,348
Chris 你应该3点回家的 你现在在哪?
Chris, you're supposed to be home at 3:00. Where are you?

352
00:15:14,349 --> 00:15:17,290
你...得到警察局来接我
I... need you to pick me up at the police station.

353
00:15:17,607 --> 00:15:18,607
你被拘留了?!
You're in jail?!

354
00:15:18,993 --> 00:15:21,508
无论你做了什么 一个字都别说
No matter what y did, don't say nothing.

355
00:15:21,912 --> 00:15:24,718
- 但是 爸爸 我没有... - 我不是告诉你什么都别说吗?
- But, Dad, I didn't... - Didn't I tell you don't say nothing?

356
00:15:24,761 --> 00:15:27,805
你所说的每一句话 将来都可能对你不利
Anything you say can and will be used against you.

357
00:15:28,402 --> 00:15:31,572
我老爸的口吻像个律师似的
That  was as close as my father came to being a lawyer.

358
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,729
闭上你的嘴 我马上就到
Keep your mouth shut, I'll be there in a minute.

359
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:34,730
好的
Okay.

360
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:39,167
你卖这些东西是为了什么?
So what are you selling these things for, anyway?

361
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,063
全班去华盛顿特区野外郊游
A class trip to Washington, DC.

362
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,503
有花生酱口味或巧克力人的吗?
got any peanut butter Do-Si-Do?

363
00:15:43,946 --> 00:15:44,946
只有这些了
Just these.

364
00:15:46,047 --> 00:15:47,223
巧克力曲奇 哈?
Chocolate chip, huh?

365
00:15:48,798 --> 00:15:49,856
多少钱?
How much are they?

366
00:15:52,103 --> 00:15:53,504
警察们也是人
Say what you want about cops,

367
00:15:53,505 --> 00:15:55,446
他们肯定也喜欢吃甜食
they sure got a mean sweet tooth.

368
00:15:56,209 --> 00:15:58,326
在这签个名就可以走了
Sign right there and you're all set.

369
00:16:04,276 --> 00:16:06,452
没事的 他们只是长了水痘
It's okay, they just got chicken pox.

370
00:16:12,032 --> 00:16:13,032
嗨 爸爸
Hi, Dad.

371
00:16:13,194 --> 00:16:14,545
我们走吧
Come on, let's go.

372
00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:15,889
你生我的气吗?
Are you mad at me?

373
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:16,890
当然 我快疯了
Yeah, I'm mad.

374
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,164
我没做错事 告诉他
I wasn't doing anything wrong. Tell him.

375
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:22,912
嘿 我可没说你没做错事
Hey, I never said you didn't do anything wrong.

376
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,913
你站在一个商店外面 说你那有赃物
You were standing outside a store claiming you had stolen goods.

377
00:16:26,005 --> 00:16:28,406
这么做虽然不犯法 但也不对
It's not illegal, but it ain't right, either.

378
00:16:28,556 --> 00:16:30,085
听你爸爸的话
You listen to your father.

379
00:16:31,313 --> 00:16:32,313
他是个聪明人
He's a smart man.

380
00:16:33,417 --> 00:16:34,403
谢谢
Thanks.

381
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,921
在NWA拳击开赛以前 你能一颗大牙不掉
<i>Before NWA, you could actually leave a police station</i>

382
00:16:36,922 --> 00:16:39,686
大摇大摆的走出警察局
<i>with the same amount of teeth you came in with.</i>

383
00:16:39,925 --> 00:16:40,925
爸爸?
Dad?

384
00:16:41,578 --> 00:16:43,166
我还能去旅行吗?
Can I still go on the trip?

385
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,294
当然
Yeah. Come on.

386
00:16:45,548 --> 00:16:48,136
当我梦想着能赶快出狱时
<i>While I was dreaming about getting out of jail,</i>

387
00:16:48,137 --> 00:16:50,666
妈妈却在梦想着她是梦女郎
<i>my mother was dreaming she was a Dreamgirl.</i>

388
00:17:03,873 --> 00:17:05,461
看谁回来了
Well. Look who's back.

389
00:17:05,523 --> 00:17:06,416
演唱会怎么样?
How was the play?

390
00:17:06,428 --> 00:17:08,882
宝贝 简直难以置信
Oh, baby, it was incredible!

391
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,480
你肯定会爱死它的
You would have loved it.

392
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:11,770
孩子们怎样了?
How are the kids?

393
00:17:11,971 --> 00:17:13,022
Tonya睡着了
Well, Tonya's asleep,

394
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:15,814
Drew退烧了 还有 Chris被捕了
Drew's fever is down, and Chris got arrested.

395
00:17:17,081 --> 00:17:20,671
但是...唯一重要的是你玩得很开心
But... the only thing that matters is that you had a good time.

396
00:17:20,985 --> 00:17:23,455
什么? 你说Chris被捕了是什么意思?
What? What do you mean Chris got arrested?

397
00:17:23,638 --> 00:17:24,638
已经解决了
It's over.

398
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,043
只是个误会
It was a misunderstanding.

399
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:27,793
我去接他了 也安顿好了这件事
I went down and took care of it.

400
00:17:27,794 --> 00:17:28,794
你确定吗?
Are you sure?

401
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,150
确定
Yeah.

402
00:17:30,498 --> 00:17:31,968
你玩得开心吗?
Did you have a good time?

403
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:34,433
开心极了!
I had a great time!

404
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:37,283
宝贝 简直难以置信
Oh, baby, it was incredible.

406
00:17:39,611 --> 00:17:41,787
你开心就好
Well, as long as you had a good time.

407
00:17:47,949 --> 00:17:49,430
你怎么了?
What's wrong with you?

408
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:50,936
没什么
Nothing.

409
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:51,937
你有事
Something.

410

怎么了?
What?

411
00:17:54,136 --> 00:17:56,649
在我们纪念日里 你一直Sheila在一块 就是这个事
What's wrong is you spent our anniversary with Sheila.

412
00:17:56,695 --> 00:17:58,022
你怎么能丢下我去了?
How could you go without me?

413
00:17:58,058 --> 00:17:59,889
宝贝 你让我去的
Baby, you told me to go.

414
00:17:59,956 --> 00:18:00,956
我不是这个意思
I didn't mean it.

415
00:18:01,505 --> 00:18:03,853
就像你告诉我不需要给你买礼物
It's just like when you tell me not to get you a gift.

416
00:18:03,889 --> 00:18:05,685
我那样说 只是想说些好话
I was just saying that to be nice.

417
00:18:05,732 --> 00:18:07,998
我不想浪费那票
I didn't want the tickets to go to waste.

418
00:18:08,068 --> 00:18:10,229
我想让你去 让你玩得开心
And I wanted you to go and have a good time.

419
00:18:10,287 --> 00:18:11,900
你竟然真照办了 我都快疯了
I'm just mad that you did.

420
00:18:12,546 --> 00:18:14,627
你知道你在做没意义的事吗?
You know you're not making a bit of sense, right?

421
00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:15,628
我知道
I know.

422
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:17,179
忘了它吧
Forget it.

423
00:18:18,692 --> 00:18:20,049
座位怎么样?
How were the seats?

424
00:18:20,664 --> 00:18:22,138
你不会想知道
You don't want to know.

425
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:23,789
那么好?
That good?

426
00:18:24,441 --> 00:18:25,441
没错
Yup.

427
00:18:26,046 --> 00:18:27,344
该死的Risky
Damn, Risky.

428
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,600
这是什么?
What's this?

429
00:18:32,002 --> 00:18:34,178
我在回家的路上买的
I made a little stop on the way home.

430
00:18:34,255 --> 00:18:35,313
结婚纪念日快乐
Happy anniversary.

431
00:18:35,858 --> 00:18:37,609
你给了我一张卡片
Oh, you got me a card.

432
00:18:38,461 --> 00:18:40,049
Julius 你得打开它
Julius, just open the card.

433
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:47,535
尼克斯队决赛的票?!
Knicks playoff tickets?!

434
00:18:49,477 --> 00:18:52,241
Risky说这是最好的座了
Risky said they're the best seats in the house.

435
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,634
太棒了!太棒了!
Oh! Yes! Yes!

436
00:18:54,658 --> 00:18:56,336
- 怎么了? - 干得漂亮 Clyde!
- What happened? - That's right, Clyde!

437
00:18:56,371 --> 00:18:57,486
干得漂亮 Clyde!
That's right, Clyde!

438
00:18:58,202 --> 00:18:59,658
谢谢你 宝贝!
Thank you, baby!

439
00:19:00,243 --> 00:19:01,671
啊 不
Uh-uh. No.

440
00:19:04,445 --> 00:19:06,472
我们的纪念日还没结束呢
Our anniversary ain't over yet.

441
00:19:07,304 --> 00:19:08,784
我说过那句话吗?
Ooh, did I say that?

442
00:19:10,718 --> 00:19:11,958
我说了
I said it.

443
00:19:16,215 --> 00:19:17,373
伙计 我等不及了!
Oh, man, I can't wait!

444
00:19:17,431 --> 00:19:19,486
事实上 我们要去参观参议院!
We're actually going to visit the senate floor!

445
00:19:19,521 --> 00:19:21,103
你知道吗 由于安全原因
Did you know, for security reasons

446
00:19:21,162 --> 00:19:23,823
没有直接通往白宫的线路
there's no direct route to or from the White House?

447
00:19:23,926 --> 00:19:26,400
以防有人试图杀害总统
Just in case somebody tries to kill the president?

448
00:19:26,447 --> 00:19:28,421
他们该在Bed-Stuy做这事
They need to do that in Bed-Stuy.

449
00:19:28,574 --> 00:19:29,884
嘿 讨厌鬼
Hey, cell nerd.

450
00:19:29,988 --> 00:19:31,386
你脸颊上是什么?
What's that on your cheek?

451
00:19:31,468 --> 00:19:32,959
看起来像水痘
It looks like chicken pox.
