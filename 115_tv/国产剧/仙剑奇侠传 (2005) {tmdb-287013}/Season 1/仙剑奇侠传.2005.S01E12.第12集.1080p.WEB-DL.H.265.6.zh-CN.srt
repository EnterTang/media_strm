<i>布鲁克林 1983</i>

2
00:00:04,803 --> 00:00:06,637
<i>当你成为一个青少年人的时候
When you first become a teenager,

3
00:00:06,638 --> 00:00:08,843
<i>因为你不在是一个小孩子了
you think it's cool to just be a teenager.

4
00:00:08,844 --> 00:00:11,515
<i>可是，很快你就明白</i>
Then you find out no matter how cool you act,

5
00:00:11,516 --> 00:00:13,236
<i>无论你装得有多酷，其实一点也不酷</i>
if you don't look cool,

6
00:00:13,237 --> 00:00:15,467
<i>除非你在长大5岁</i>
you might as well be five years old.

7
00:00:15,468 --> 00:00:17,622
<i>当我13岁的时候，最酷的事情就是</i>
And the coolest thing you could have when I was 13

8
00:00:17,623 --> 00:00:19,385
<i>穿皮甲克</i>
was a leather jacket.

9
00:00:19,385 --> 00:00:22,981
<i>这小孩也许没有老爸， 可他有 皮 夹 克。</i>
He might not have a daddy,

10
00:00:20,982 --> 00:00:22,648
but he's got a leather jacket.

11
00:00:25,678 --> 00:00:26,741
缇榭！
Keisha, you got a leather jacket, too?

12
00:00:26,741 --> 00:00:28,020
你也弄了件皮甲克？
My mom just got it off layaway for me.

13
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:30,452
是啊，我妈给我的。

14
00:00:30,453 --> 00:00:32,066
我真想也弄一件。
I was thinking about getting one.

15
00:00:32,067 --> 00:00:33,836
你也准备弄一件？为什么？
You are? Why?

16
00:00:34,336 --> 00:00:36,704
看看我?又瘦又小像个罗卜头？
Look at me. I'm skinny and I'm short.

17
00:00:36,974 --> 00:00:39,135
只有穿上皮甲克才能装酷。
I'm not going to become cool overnight.

18
00:00:39,136 --> 00:00:40,711
你也没有那么衰。 
You don't look that bad, though.

19
00:00:40,712 --> 00:00:42,653
但我还是应该武装起来。
Yeah, but I need something.

20
00:00:43,191 --> 00:00:45,351
你想我穿皮甲克怎么样？
You think a leather jacket would help?

21
00:00:45,352 --> 00:00:46,936
估计很帅。
I guess.

22
00:00:46,936 --> 00:00:47,917
<i>一件皮甲克绝对让我</i>
All I was thinking is that

23
00:00:47,918 --> 00:00:51,157
<i>由罗卜头</i>
the right leather jacket would have turned me from this guy...

24
00:00:51,158 --> 00:00:53,386
<i>变成大酷男</i>
into this guy.

25
00:00:53,438 --> 00:00:54,416
... 克里斯！
Chris. That leather jacket is cool.

26
00:00:54,417 --> 00:00:56,173
你的皮甲克真酷！

27
00:00:56,174 --> 00:00:57,597
有空我们一起玩。
Let's hang out.

28
00:00:57,598 --> 00:00:59,682
摆几个POSE给你瞧瞧。
As soon as I'm finished posing.

29
00:01:05,683 --> 00:01:07,632
<i>怎样才能弄到那件皮甲克</i>
I knew where to get a leather jacket.

30
00:01:07,633 --> 00:01:10,479
<i>我想我需要美圆</i>
Now all I needed was money.

Transcript: Raceman - Trad: Birdyben Synchro/Relecture: Sixe

32
00:01:43,622 --> 00:01:44,851
皮甲克？
A leather jacket?

33
00:01:44,852 --> 00:01:46,428
要皮甲克干什么？
What do you need a leather jacket for?

34
00:01:46,887 --> 00:01:48,681
缇榭 说皮甲克很酷。
Keisha said it was cool.

35
00:01:48,682 --> 00:01:50,720
你认为皮甲克会让你变酷。
You think a leather jacket's going to make you cool?

36
00:01:50,721 --> 00:01:53,443
<i>这些家伙就是榜样</i>
It made these guys gazillionaires.

37
00:01:53,444 --> 00:01:54,524
当然可以
It could.

38
00:01:54,525 --> 00:01:56,059
问题是，
The only thing is, I don't have $50.

39
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,712
我没有50美圆。
Just save up your allowance.

40
00:01:57,713 --> 00:01:59,206
你可以把你的零用钱存起来。
My what?

41
00:01:59,207 --> 00:02:00,686
什么？
Allowance. It's money.

42
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:03,375
零花钱， 你老爸每周给你的。
That your parents give you every week.

43
00:02:03,376 --> 00:02:05,254
<i>我听说过“零用钱”</i>
I'd heard about allowances,

44
00:02:05,255 --> 00:02:07,404
<i>可我从来没有“见”过</i>
but I didn't know they actually existed.

45
00:02:07,405 --> 00:02:09,499
<i>我以为那只是电视上才发生的事情</i>
I thought it was just something that happened on TV.

46
00:02:09,885 --> 00:02:11,395
给，儿子。
Here you go, son.

47
00:02:11,396 --> 00:02:14,058
.1000美圆 谢谢老爸?
A thousand dollars.

48
00:02:12,818 --> 00:02:13,818
Thank you, father.

49
00:02:16,322 --> 00:02:18,407
<i>自从我爸爸开始拼命工作</i>
Since my father was always working,

50
00:02:18,408 --> 00:02:20,484
<i>他看上去总是心事重重</i>
he always seemed kind of grumpy.

51
00:02:20,485 --> 00:02:23,522
<i>我们找不到机会开口要钱。</i>
It seemed like there was never a good time to ask my father for money.

52
00:02:23,523 --> 00:02:26,905
爸爸，可以给我15元，我可以去郊游。
Daddy, can I have $15 to go on a field trip

53
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,082
to the the Statue of Liberty?

54
00:02:27,632 --> 00:02:28,813
好
Okay.

55
00:02:28,814 --> 00:02:31,140
老爸，可以给我5圆钱看电影吗？
And, Dad, can I have $5 to go to the show?

56
00:02:31,831 --> 00:02:32,777
好
Okay.

57
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:35,391
老公，给我25美圆逛街好吗？
Baby, can I get $25 to go shopping?

58
00:02:35,391 --> 00:02:36,691
好
Okay.

59
00:02:36,692 --> 00:02:39,306
<i>看来这是我开口的黄金机会</i>
It looks like this might be a good time after all.

60
00:02:39,307 --> 00:02:40,256
老爸，
Hey, Dad?

61
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,322
我能要一件皮甲克吗？
Can I get a leather jacket?

62
00:02:42,323 --> 00:02:43,932
皮甲克？
A leather jacket?

63
00:02:43,933 --> 00:02:45,431
你有钱买吗？
You got some leather-jacket money?

64
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:47,009
你要皮甲克干什么?
Well, what do you need a leather jacket for?

65
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,775
朱尔的旧衣服不是挺好吗？
What's wrong with Drew's old coat?

66
00:02:48,776 --> 00:02:50,526
<i>以前，朱尔穿我的衣服。</i>
Instead of Drew wearing my old clothes,

67
00:02:50,527 --> 00:02:51,885
<i>现在,我穿朱尔的衣服</i>
I wore his old clothes.

68
00:02:51,886 --> 00:02:54,974
<i>谁叫我发育迟缓呢！</i>
I think I was the first kid to get hand-me-ups.

69
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:56,320
太小了。
It's too small,

70
00:02:56,321 --> 00:02:57,817
过时了。
it's out of style,

71
00:02:57,818 --> 00:02:59,495
又不酷。
and it's just not cool.

72
00:02:59,496 --> 00:03:00,955
穿衣服不是为了装酷，
It ain't supposed to be cool.

73
00:03:00,956 --> 00:03:02,455
而是为了保暖。
It's supposed to be warm.

74
00:03:02,456 --> 00:03:03,992
保暖就足够了。
Being warm is cool.

75
00:03:03,993 --> 00:03:05,531
我不是要你出钱。
I'm not asking you to buy it.

76
00:03:05,532 --> 00:03:06,840
我自己存钱。
I'll save up.

77
00:03:06,841 --> 00:03:08,374
存什么钱？
Save up what?

78
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,617
存你给我零花钱？
I was hoping you can give me an allowance.

79
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,857
<i>我知道这个要求很白痴。</i>
I know it sounded like an innocent enough question,

80
00:03:14,858 --> 00:03:16,719
<i>真想出现这样的情况</i>
but here's what he heard.

81
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,086
你每天象奴隶一样工作，
Since you work like a slave all day

82
00:03:18,087 --> 00:03:19,813
却没有机会花钱，
and don't have any time to enjoy your own money,

83
00:03:19,814 --> 00:03:21,465
不如，我帮你花。
can I have it?

84
00:03:24,231 --> 00:03:26,871
我不会给你这个无所事事的臭小子一分钱。
I'm not giving you money for walking around doing nothing.

85
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,769
零花钱？！
An allowance?

86
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,898
我让你睡在我家里，
I'll allow you to sleep here at night.

87
00:03:30,899 --> 00:03:33,010
我允许你吃我的土豆
I'll allow you to eat them potatoes.

88
00:03:33,067 --> 00:03:35,150
我允许你用我的电灯。
I'll allow you to use my lights.

89
00:03:35,151 --> 00:03:37,266
我允许你喝我的汽水。
I'll allow you to drink my Kool-Aid.

90
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:39,493
我允许你吃我的绿豆……
I'll allow you to nibble on them green beans.

91
00:03:39,494 --> 00:03:42,070
我允许你看我的电视
I'll allow you to look at that TV.

92
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:44,178
我允许你用我的煤气
I'll allow you to run up my gas bill.

93
00:03:44,179 --> 00:03:46,368
我允许你在我家里晃悠
I'll allow you to walk up my stairs.

94
00:03:46,369 --> 00:03:49,822
我允许你向我提出这样荒谬的要求
I'll allow you to ask me these ridiculous-ass questions.

95
00:03:49,823 --> 00:03:51,593
你还指望我给你零用钱？
Why should I give you an allowance

96
00:03:51,594 --> 00:03:54,529
你做的一起都是我在买单。
when I already paid for everything you do?

97
00:03:54,684 --> 00:03:57,270
你见过谁有零用钱？
Who you know that gets an allowance?

98
00:03:56,578 --> 00:03:57,578
Huh?

99
00:03:58,191 --> 00:03:59,827
训话完毕！
I'm finished.

100
00:04:00,213 --> 00:04:03,874
格根就有零用钱。 他老爸每周给他5元。
I was talking to Greg and

101
00:04:01,915 --> 00:04:03,987
he said that he gets five dollars a week.

102
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:06,197
听起来，他老爸比我厚道，
Sounds like Greg's doing better than me.

103
00:04:06,198 --> 00:04:08,099
你就找他老爸要钱去吧，
Ask him for an allowance.

104
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,677
你想买皮甲克，
You want to buy a leather coat,

105
00:04:09,942 --> 00:04:13,003
你必须自己挣钱。
you  need to get a leather-coat job.

106
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,570
<i>老爸不在家的时候，</i>
While things might have been tight with my father,

107
00:04:15,571 --> 00:04:17,484
<i>老妈很休闲。</i>
my mother was getting loose.

108
00:04:17,485 --> 00:04:20,476
<i>独自在家的时候，她总是很开心，</i>
She was always happy when she had the house to herself.

109
00:04:21,515 --> 00:04:23,769
<i>看看小报</i>
She caught up on her reading.

110
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,798
<i>煲煲电话</i>
She talked on the phone.

111
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:29,567
<i>偷吃很贵的零食，还是背着我们藏起来的。</i>
She  ate expensive candy she hid from us.

112
00:04:29,913 --> 00:04:34,438
<i>但总有一些意想不到的事情打断她……</i>
But there was one thing that she never counted on to mess up her day.

113
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,057
请进
Coming...

114
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:42,179
你们回来干什么？
What are y'all doing here?

115
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,110
学校有出了点事。
Something went wrong at our school.

116
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:46,302
关于铅涂料。
Something about the paint.

117
00:04:48,984 --> 00:04:50,482
<i> ... 瘃怿 徕祆 " " .鲠?漕腴?蝈豇?/i></i>
Before vending machines were put into schools,

118
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:56,663
<i>饿着肚子的孩子就像吃薯片一样吃掉它</i>
hungry kids often snacked on lead paint chips.

119
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,837
味道好极了
Mmm.

120
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,620
This is good!

121
00:05:00,646 --> 00:05:04,099
<i>如果不是嘴馋，我们不会吃这些“特种材料”。</i>
If we had ladders, he'd have ate the asbestos.

122
00:05:03,522 --> 00:05:05,177
I want one! Me, too! Me, too!

123
00:05:05,827 --> 00:05:07,560
给我留一点?
Me, too! Come on, me too!

124
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:12,566
等学校处理好之后，我们才能回去。
So we can go back after they finish repainting our classrooms.

125
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:15,490
好。乖乖的，我刚打扫干净。
All right, well, y'all stay out of my way,

126
00:05:15,491 --> 00:05:17,273
一整天，我们干什么？
cause I'm cleaning up.

127
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:16,858
What are we going to do all day?

128
00:05:17,274 --> 00:05:18,158
随便
I don't know.

129
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:19,919
自己玩吧
Go play.

130
00:05:20,572 --> 00:05:24,271
在4:30之前，别弄乱了房子。
But you all better not mess up my house till after 4:30!

131
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,797
现在的小孩子，
I mean, asbestos kills,

132
00:05:27,798 --> 00:05:30,221
连涂料也吃?
a little paint ain't gonna hurt.

133
00:05:30,222 --> 00:05:31,661
<i>他们回来之后，</i>
After a day out of school,

134
00:05:31,662 --> 00:05:34,206
<i>老妈就找不到乐趣了。</i>
my mother wasn't having any fun.

135
00:05:34,207 --> 00:05:36,245
<i>塔尼亚和朱尔也挺无聊</i>
And neither were Tonya and Drew.

136
00:05:36,246 --> 00:05:38,369
你在干什么？ 看漫画
- What are you doing? - Nothing.

137
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,912
当黑人小孩无聊的时候，
When broke kids get bored,

138
00:05:39,913 --> 00:05:43,162
我们就玩那个流传很久的不用花钱的游戏
they play one of the cheapest games ever invented:

139
00:05:43,163 --> 00:05:44,661
“赌你不敢！"
"I Dare You."

140
00:05:44,662 --> 00:05:49,176
我赌你不敢把这些冰放到衣服里。
I dare you to put these ice cubes under your armpit.

141
00:05:49,713 --> 00:05:52,352
赌多久?
For how long?

142
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:53,723
一分钟
One minute.

143
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
Okay.

144
00:05:56,688 --> 00:06:00,236
1…… 2……
Whoo!

145
00:05:56,587 --> 00:05:57,644
One...

146
00:05:58,677 --> 00:05:59,698
two...

147
00:06:00,237 --> 00:06:01,620
数得太慢了，塔尼亚。
Count it normal, Tonya...

148
00:06:01,621 --> 00:06:04,092
3…… 你们两个小鬼在干什么？
three...

149
00:06:04,093 --> 00:06:07,120
我赌他不敢把冰放到衣服里。
Girl, what is wrong with you?

150
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,924
I dared him to put ice cubes under his arms.

151
00:06:07,121 --> 00:06:09,389
把冰拿出来，笨蛋。
Take the ice cubes from under your arm.

152
00:06:10,311 --> 00:06:12,933
别放到杯子里，
Not... in the glass.

153
00:06:12,934 --> 00:06:15,296
我们还要喝水呢。
Boy, people got to drink from that.

154
00:06:15,297 --> 00:06:17,349
呵呵，我赌你不敢喝。
Okay, I dare you to drink it.

155
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:19,229
千万别喝? 很脏。
You better not. That's nasty.

156
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:20,189
我不喝。
I'm not.

157
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:21,858
不要赌这些无聊的东西。
You know what? Since you all want to dare so bad,

158
00:06:21,859 --> 00:06:25,933
不如赌你们谁能安静坐着别惹事。
why don't y'all dare each other

159
00:06:23,198 --> 00:06:25,404
to sit down and act like y'all got some sense?

160
00:06:25,934 --> 00:06:27,355
不难办到吧。
How about that?

161
00:06:27,356 --> 00:06:29,729
很高兴你们能安静的待在家里。
Boy, I'll be glad when y'all go back to school.

162
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,934
你们让我感觉很无聊。
You are driving me up the wall.

163
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:33,508
相 当 无聊！
Two walls.

164
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:35,461
你必须喝了。
Now you have to do something.

165
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:36,576
太脏了。
That's nasty.

166
00:06:36,577 --> 00:06:39,792
<i>同一时刻，这地球上最衰的男孩 也弄了件皮甲克</i>
Meanwhile, I felt like the only guy on earth without a leather jacket.

167
00:06:39,793 --> 00:06:42,140
－你也弄了件皮甲克? －帅呆了吧?
You got a leather jacket?

168
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:44,444
我老爸大发慈悲，给我买了皮甲克。
Cool, huh?

169
00:06:41,989 --> 00:06:44,189
My dad got it for me at the army surplus store.

170
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:47,198
你这个家伙不是说皮甲克很衰的吗？
Hey, weren't you the one who said that leather didn't make you cool?

171
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,425
嘿嘿，看来我错了。
Yeah, but I was wrong.

172
00:06:50,195 --> 00:06:52,180
你老爸同意给你零用钱了？
So, what did your dad say about an allowance?

173
00:06:52,181 --> 00:06:53,601
他用了两个小时，
He said no... for about two hours.

174
00:06:53,602 --> 00:06:55,295
来告诉我 没门。
Hi, Greg.

175
00:06:55,296 --> 00:06:57,939
嗨！格莱格? 很帅的皮甲克！
Nice jacket.

176
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,278
连她也跟你说话了。
Wait. She's talking to you?

177
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:02,127
帅吧！
Cool, huh?

178
00:07:02,768 --> 00:07:04,809
这让我买皮甲克的决心更坚定！
I got to get me a leather jacket.

179
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:08,382
<i>十三岁的孩子很难找工作。</i>
Finding a job when you're 13 is not the easiest thing to do.

180
00:07:08,383 --> 00:07:09,999
<i>找容易的工作……</i>
I applied for easy jobs...

181
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,016
我为什么要把工作给你， 不就是往袋子里装东西。
Now why would I pay you to put groceries in a bag

182
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:15,126
我自己就可以搞定了。
when I can put them in a bag my damn self?

183
00:07:15,127 --> 00:07:16,571
<i>找困难的工作……</i>
I applied for hard jobs...

184
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,216
想做保安？
Security guard, huh?

185
00:07:20,217 --> 00:07:21,507
以前开过枪吗?
You ever been shot?

186
00:07:22,438 --> 00:07:24,593
<i>看来，我必须试试那些“计划外”的工作</i>
I even applied for jobs I didn't know I was applying for.

187
00:07:24,594 --> 00:07:26,740
有工作经验吗?
You any good with matches?

188
00:07:27,283 --> 00:07:29,408
我只要经验丰富的人材。
There's a new barber down the block.

189
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:31,783
等你有了经验再来吧。
He needs to be taught a lesson.

190
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:37,003
我赌你不敢用背滑下楼梯。
I dare you to slide down the stairs on your back.

191
00:07:37,655 --> 00:07:39,297
给我毛巾。
Give me the towel.

192
00:07:39,298 --> 00:07:41,760
<i>哇，看来躲在家里玩也和在布鲁克林街头一样</i>
The only place more dangerous than the streets of Brooklyn

193
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,953
<i>都有生命危险。</i>
were the hallways of Brooklyn.

194
00:07:45,804 --> 00:07:47,775
<i>经历这么多挫败之后</i>
After running out of options,

195
00:07:47,776 --> 00:07:50,930
<i>我只能指望一个人，可以帮我找到工作</i>
I could only think of one person that could help me find work.

196
00:07:51,008 --> 00:07:52,008
Hey.

197
00:07:52,661 --> 00:07:54,650
爸，能帮我弄一份工作吗?
Dad, can you help me get a job?

198
00:07:55,383 --> 00:07:56,559
什么？
- What? - I want to get a leather jacket.

199
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,290
我非常想买皮甲克。

200
00:07:58,676 --> 00:08:01,975
我试过了，可是到现在还是找不到工作。
And I've been trying to get a job, but it's not working out so far.

201
00:08:01,976 --> 00:08:04,205
你是认真的？
You  want it that bad, huh?

202
00:08:04,206 --> 00:08:05,396
对
Yeah.

203
00:08:05,934 --> 00:08:07,919
不如跟着我混？
Want to come and work with me?

204
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,306
－真的？ －不假。
- For real? - Yeah. Tomorrow's Saturday.

205
00:08:09,307 --> 00:08:12,305
到周末了，你可以帮我送报纸。
You can come do deliveries with me.

206
00:08:12,306 --> 00:08:16,109
我几个小时后回来。 3:30在楼下等我。
I'll be back in a few hours.

207
00:08:13,348 --> 00:08:15,244
Now  be downstairs at 3:30.

208
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:19,070
－最迟3:31。 －我一定早到。
Not 3:31.

209
00:08:17,157 --> 00:08:18,738
Don't worry. I'll be down early.

210
00:08:19,071 --> 00:08:20,494
你不可能早到。
No such thing as early.

211
00:08:20,495 --> 00:08:22,265
只要不迟到就可以了。
You're either on time or you're late.

212
00:08:22,266 --> 00:08:24,238
<i>终于朝我朝思暮想的皮甲克， 迈出了第一步。</i>
I was committed to getting that jacket.

213
00:08:24,239 --> 00:08:25,779
<i>一切都是想起来简单，</i>
Nothing was going to stop me.

214
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,856
<i>做起来很难。</i>
Nothing except a nap.

215
00:09:03,254 --> 00:09:06,397
<i>我以为老爸对我爽约会非常生气。</i>
I thought my father would be really mad that I missed work.

216
00:09:06,398 --> 00:09:10,244
<i>看来，一件皮甲克变成一顿“皮鞭”</i>
Instead of getting a leather jacket,

217
00:09:07,983 --> 00:09:10,344
I thought I was going to get a leather belt.

218
00:09:10,771 --> 00:09:12,404
你早上怎么了？
- What happened to you this morning? - I overslept.

219
00:09:12,405 --> 00:09:14,169
我睡过头了。

220
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,505
你为什么不上来弄醒我？
How come you didn't come get me?

221
00:09:15,505 --> 00:09:17,390
是你想要找工作，
You the one want the job.

222
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,893
工作可不会去找你。
Job ain't gonna wait for you.

223
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,773
<i>这两位还在玩游戏</i>
In the game of Dare, there are no rules,

224
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:31,081
<i>不用守规则，不用循规蹈矩。只要胆大如牛就够了。</i>
there are no regulations

225
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:30,444
and the game doesn't end till somebody's dead.

226
00:09:45,767 --> 00:09:47,859
赌你不敢喝。
I dare you.

227
00:09:48,512 --> 00:09:50,881
有什么好处？
What you going to give me?

228
00:09:51,705 --> 00:09:53,327
2美圆
Two dollars.

229
00:09:57,947 --> 00:10:00,019
快喝……
Drink it. Hurry up.

230
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:02,790
快喝……托尼亚。
Hurry up, Tonya.

231
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,907
快喝……
More. Drink it.

232
00:10:11,971 --> 00:10:13,459
酷！
Cool.

233
00:10:17,422 --> 00:10:19,125
味道如何？
How was it?

234
00:10:19,971 --> 00:10:22,194
交出两美圆
Give me my two dollars.

235
00:10:23,349 --> 00:10:27,188
<i>第二天，我起来很早。</i>
The next morning, I was up earlier than a Marine with a paper route.

236
00:10:27,189 --> 00:10:28,189
咖啡？
Coffee?

237
00:10:31,457 --> 00:10:34,118
<i>走进老爸工作的地方，</i>
Working with my father was mind-blowing.

238
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:37,621
<i>我不敢相信，这里非常大，非常吵</i>
I couldn't believe how big it was,

239
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:36,995
how loud it was.

240
00:10:37,622 --> 00:10:39,478
<i>一起都运作的很快！</i>
How fast everything was going.

241
00:10:39,478 --> 00:10:41,737
<i>我就像是走进维加斯的流浪儿童</i>
I felt like an Amish kid in Vegas.

242
00:10:41,738 --> 00:10:42,738
来。

243
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:45,977
乔治！
What's up, George?

244
00:10:45,977 --> 00:10:48,207
你好，荷特！
Hey, Herc.

245
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,919
- What's up? - All right.

246
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,190
这是谁？
Who's this?

247
00:10:51,191 --> 00:10:52,695
我儿子克里斯。
That's my son, Chris.

248
00:10:52,696 --> 00:10:54,281
谁是荷特?
Who's Herc?

249
00:10:54,282 --> 00:10:55,804
荷特就是大力神，
Herc like Hercules.

250
00:10:55,805 --> 00:10:57,240
那个强壮的人。
That's a strong man.

251
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,701
<i>我只知道老妈给老爸起了个小名。</i>
The only other names I knew my father by

252
00:10:58,782 --> 00:11:00,381
were the words my mother called him,

253
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:03,309
<i>原来老爸在这里也有个小名</i>
and they didn't have nothing to do with being strong.

254
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:05,098
你也是荷特？
So, little Herc.

255
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:07,631
有你老爸风趣吗？
You funny like your old man?

256
00:11:07,632 --> 00:11:09,284
我老爸很风趣？
My father's funny?

257
00:11:09,285 --> 00:11:11,632
也不是那么风趣？
Ah, he ain't that funny.

258
00:11:11,891 --> 00:11:15,364
是啊，我比你们这两个小子风趣多了。
Funnier than you two corny...

259
00:11:13,818 --> 00:11:14,676
Oh!

260
00:11:15,365 --> 00:11:17,356
<i>老爸从来不抱怨</i>
My father never cursed at home,

261
00:11:17,357 --> 00:11:19,161
<i>可在这里，他的抱怨很多</i>
so hearing him curse at the job made me feel like I was in a secret club.

262
00:11:19,162 --> 00:11:21,530
<i>我好像置身于“诉苦”俱乐部</i>

263
00:11:21,453 --> 00:11:24,353
Get to work before I bring your mama back in here.

264
00:11:24,863 --> 00:11:26,718
Yeah, okay, whatever you say.

265
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:27,832
See you, Little Herc.

266
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:31,388
You don't want me to tell your mama to come back here, too, man.

267
00:11:34,135 --> 00:11:35,527
我们开始工作吧。
Hey, let's get to work.

268
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,874
<i>自从老爸被老妈镇压以后。</i>
I haven't heard cursing like that since my father stepped on my mother's bunion.

269
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,451
<i>他从没敢在家里这样抱怨。</i>

270
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:52,585
<i>在家里，游戏刚刚结束， 麻烦却开始了。</i>
At home, the Dare game was over,

271
00:11:50,552 --> 00:11:52,440
but  the trouble was just starting.

272
00:12:00,009 --> 00:12:01,298
你怎么了？宝贝。
What's wrong, baby?

273
00:12:01,299 --> 00:12:03,335
我在房间里听见你好像不对劲。
I heard you moaning all the way from my room.

274
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:05,643
我的胃疼。
My stomach hurts really bad.

275
00:12:05,644 --> 00:12:07,225
让我看看。
Let me feel.

276
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,908
糟糕，你有点发烧。
Oh, no. You're burning up.

277
00:12:09,909 --> 00:12:11,794
让我看看你的肚子。
Let me feel your tummy.

278
00:12:11,795 --> 00:12:13,604
我要带你去急诊室。
Okay, baby, I'm gonna take you to the emergency room.

279
00:12:13,605 --> 00:12:15,259
等着，我去给你那衣服。
Wait here. I'm gonna get your coat.

280
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,798
朱尔，起床。
Drew, get up!

281
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:18,761
<i>只有发生了非常严重的情况 我们才去看医生。</i>
Going to the doctor was serious business,

282
00:12:18,762 --> 00:12:21,396
<i>通常情况下，我们得了小伤小病，</i>
because usually, if something was wrong with one of us,

283
00:12:21,397 --> 00:12:24,324
<i>老爸，老妈认为， “云南白药”包治百病。</i>
my parents thought they could fix it with Robitussin.

284
00:12:24,324 --> 00:12:26,892
啊！
Ow!

285
00:12:26,893 --> 00:12:28,539
我的手指受伤了。
I burned my finger!

286
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,193
让我看看。
Let me see, boy, let me see.

287
00:12:30,654 --> 00:12:32,777
我给你上点“云南白药”。
Take some Robitussin.

288
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,701
嘴里有两个泡泡。
Looks like a tooth broke off.

289
00:12:36,161 --> 00:12:38,175
我去拿“云南白药”。
Yeah. I'll go get the Robitussin.

290
00:12:39,401 --> 00:12:40,493
妈，
What?

291
00:12:40,494 --> 00:12:42,301
克里斯被车撞了。
Mama, Chris just got hit by a car.

292
00:12:42,302 --> 00:12:44,684
哦，我的老天。我马上去拿“云南白药”。
Oh, my God, I'll go get the Robitussin.

293
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,169
我不会告诉她。
I'm not telling her.

294
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,555
是你自己要喝的。
You're the one who drank it.

295
00:12:51,555 --> 00:12:53,210
是你赌我不敢喝。
You dared me!

296
00:12:53,284 --> 00:12:54,890
小声点。
Shh. Be quiet.

297
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:56,728
来吧，我们走。
Okay, come on. Let's go.

298
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,214
<i>外面真冷啊。</i>
It was cold outside.

299
00:13:06,215 --> 00:13:08,669
<i>我很累，这些报纸就像有千斤重。</i>
I was tired, and those papers were heavy.

300
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,868
<i>为了买那件皮甲克，我必须忍辱负重。</i>
I was starting to wonder if that leather jacket was worth it.

301
00:13:12,462 --> 00:13:13,904
HI，克里斯。
Hey, Chris.

302
00:13:13,904 --> 00:13:15,400
什么时候才能做完?
What time you getting off?

303
00:13:15,401 --> 00:13:18,826
差的远呢。我必须付清买皮甲克的钱。
Never.

304
00:13:16,335 --> 00:13:17,946
I got to pay off this jacket.

305
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,088
OK，搞定了。 好啊。
Okay, that's it.

306
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:27,776
我们能休息一下吗？
Good. Now can we have a break?

307
00:13:27,777 --> 00:13:29,977
天亮前，我们没有时间休息。
We won't get a break for another three hours.

308
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:31,306
走吧。
Come on.

309
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,872
<i>急诊室</i>

310
00:13:34,308 --> 00:13:35,989
<i>在电视上，我们看到</i>
If you watch TV, you know that an emergency room

311
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:40,960
<i>急诊室是世界上最繁忙的地方。</i>
is one of the most exciting places you can be.

312
00:13:41,076 --> 00:13:42,950
<i>可这是骗人的。</i>
Wrong.

313
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,418
Yeah, Charlie and Karen. They broke up.

314
00:13:45,466 --> 00:13:47,250
- What about Charlie? - Well, he went back to New York.

315
00:13:47,047 --> 00:13:50,183
打断一下，护士。 我女儿的胃快要疼死了。
Excuse me, nurse. My baby's stomach is killing her.

316
00:13:50,184 --> 00:13:52,635
<i>想想看，在急诊室工作的人</i>
The thing about people who work in emergency rooms

317
00:13:52,636 --> 00:13:55,133
<i>每天都待在空空的急诊室里</i>
is they're not the ones with the emergency-- you are.

318
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:57,064
<i>爽 啊 ！</i>
Really? But did you see Tracy last week with her new man?

319
00:13:59,552 --> 00:14:02,739
难道你没有看到我和我受伤的孩子站在这里?
Do you see me standing here with a sick child?

320
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,702
难道你没有看到我正和别人说话？
Do you see me here talking to somebody?

321
00:14:04,703 --> 00:14:06,285
我他妈受够了你们这些鸟人，
Quit hollerin' at people!

322
00:14:06,286 --> 00:14:09,201
我他妈不干了。反正我的男人打三份工。
You know, I don't need this. My man has three jobs!

323
00:14:14,761 --> 00:14:16,749
<i>成为老爸的同事，</i>
Being at work with my father

324
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,012
<i>这是我做过的最酷的事情。</i>
was one of the coolest things I ever did.

325
00:14:19,206 --> 00:14:21,001
<i>我们闯红灯</i>
We broke laws...

326
00:14:21,001 --> 00:14:24,121
糟糕，糟糕，减速……
Hey, hey, we can make it!

327
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,616
Hold on, man. Here we go.

328
00:14:24,591 --> 00:14:25,646
Let's go! Let's go!

329
00:14:25,689 --> 00:14:26,689
Whoo!

330
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,800
Yeah!

331
00:14:31,736 --> 00:14:33,515
<i>踢别人的“屁股”。</i>
Curse people out.

332
00:14:34,363 --> 00:14:36,855
快开！
Hurry up! Let's go!

333
00:14:36,856 --> 00:14:38,634
从我前面滚开。
Get out of the way!

334
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:41,753
你还是做跟屁虫吧！
Kiss my ass! That's right!

335
00:14:41,753 --> 00:14:44,625
跟在我后面闻臭屁……

336
00:14:45,216 --> 00:14:48,351
<i>那是我经历过的最让人兴奋的晚上。</i>
That's right!

337
00:14:45,165 --> 00:14:48,014
That was one of the most exciting nights of my life.

338
00:14:48,352 --> 00:14:50,309
<i>我们送报纸到布鲁克林。</i>
We delivered papers in Brooklyn.

339
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,309
<i>送报纸去皇后大道。</i>
We delivered papers in Queens,

340
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:54,615
<i>意大利人的地盘，中国人的地盘</i>
Little Italy, Chinatown,

341
00:14:54,616 --> 00:14:55,908
<i>西班牙人的地盘。</i>
Spanish Harlem,

342
00:14:55,909 --> 00:14:57,256
<i>波多黎各人的地盘</i>
Puerto Rican Harlem, the Bronx,

343
00:14:57,257 --> 00:14:59,320
<i>法国人的地盘……</i>
Greenwich Village.

344
00:14:59,321 --> 00:15:03,067
<i>甚至是没有人读报纸的地方。</i>
We delivered papers to people I didn't even know could read.

345
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:06,146
<i>这一趟要把报纸送到15个地方，</i>
And after delivering more than 15 tons worth of newspapers,

346
00:15:06,147 --> 00:15:10,557
<i>累得我只想叫娘。</i>
all I could think was "Where the hell is the sun?"

347
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,564
第36号，准备去见医生。
Um,  number 36, the doctor will see you now.

348
00:15:17,565 --> 00:15:20,390
不，不，不，这真是荒谬。
Oh, no, no, no!

349
00:15:18,247 --> 00:15:20,042
Come on! This is ridiculous!

350
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:22,101
谁来看看我的女儿?
Who's going to help my baby?

351
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:23,372
那个男人中了子弹。
That man's been shot.

352
00:15:23,373 --> 00:15:25,737
我女儿虽然没有中弹，但这不代表她不疼。
Well, just because she's not shot doesn't mean she isn't hurt.

353
00:15:25,738 --> 00:15:27,362
如果她的伤很轻，
If this wasn't an emergency,

354
00:15:27,363 --> 00:15:29,985
我们也不会出现在这里。
we wouldn't have to come to the emergency room.

355
00:15:29,986 --> 00:15:31,565
如果你再不让她进病房，
Look, if she doesn't get to see a doctor,

356
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:33,833
我就让你“爬”进病房。
we're going to have to get you a doctor.

357
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:34,918
想试试吗？
Yeah, now.

358
00:15:34,918 --> 00:15:36,681
现在！

359
00:15:36,682 --> 00:15:38,882
很抱歉让你们等了很久。
I'm sorry it took you so long to get in.

360
00:15:38,883 --> 00:15:42,422
因为刚才有人威胁要踢护士的屁股。
It's about time somebody threatened to kick that nurse's ass.

361
00:15:43,105 --> 00:15:44,974
嗯，看来我们必须进行测试。
Mm, I think we have to run some tests.

362
00:15:45,514 --> 00:15:47,016
什么测试？
What kind of tests?

363
00:15:47,016 --> 00:15:48,899
首先，要验血。小女士。
Well, first we need to draw some blood, little lady.

364
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,500
稍等……
I'll be right back.

365
00:15:50,501 --> 00:15:52,814
――嗯…… ――必须进行测试，
Mama, I don't want...!

366
00:15:51,303 --> 00:15:53,839
Baby, you have to take the test in order for youto feel better.

367
00:15:52,814 --> 00:15:55,351
――这样，你才能好过来。 ――妈……
Mom, uh...

368
00:15:56,852 --> 00:15:59,073
我必须对你坦白。
I have to tell you something.

369
00:15:59,074 --> 00:16:00,273
什么？
What?

370
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:03,243
是我让塔尼亚喝了一些“麻辣饮料”。
I dared Tonya to drink a hot sauce shake.

371
00:16:03,244 --> 00:16:04,938
“麻辣饮料”？
A hot sauce shake?

372
00:16:04,939 --> 00:16:07,247
我的女儿，你怎么这么傻？
Girl, what in the world would you do that for?

373
00:16:07,248 --> 00:16:09,594
他赌我不敢喝。
He dared me!

374
00:16:10,977 --> 00:16:13,526
医生，我认为没有必要测试了。
Doctor, I don't think that'll be necessary.

375
00:16:13,527 --> 00:16:16,831
她只是喝了一些麻辣饮料。
My son dared her to drink a hot sauce shake.

376
00:16:16,832 --> 00:16:18,232
麻辣饮料？
A hot sauce shake?

377
00:16:18,233 --> 00:16:20,581
..酱油、醋、牛奶……
Yeah, you know, vinegar, hot sauce, syrup and milk.

378
00:16:20,582 --> 00:16:24,015
我没想到这会让人生病。
I didn't know it'd make her that sick.

379
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,977
我明白了。
I know what to do.

380
00:16:27,632 --> 00:16:28,909
给。
Here.

381
00:16:29,946 --> 00:16:30,971

When she's done, she may have a slight cough.

385
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:37,830
.
Give her some Robitussin.

386
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,122
你会好的。
She'll be fine.

朱立业斯。
Julius,

391

你要把卡车开进来。
you got to take that truck back over to DeKalb.

392
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,252
明天做好吗？
- I'll do it tomorrow. - No, I need it done now.

393
00:16:54,252 --> 00:16:56,058
不行，现在就要。

394
00:16:56,059 --> 00:16:57,585
难道你就不能找别人做？
You can't find somebody else?

395
00:16:57,585 --> 00:16:59,090
我为什么要找别人做？
Why should I find somebody else? I found you.

396
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,014
我现在就找到你，
I want that truck back over to DeKalb now.

397
00:17:00,014 --> 00:17:03,137
我要你现在就去做。

398
00:17:03,138 --> 00:17:05,777
<i>原来，我以为只有一个人能指挥老爸：</i>
The only person I ever saw tell my father what to do was my mother.

Dad, you just going to let him tell you what to do?

401
00:17:10,766 --> 00:17:13,489
人在屋檐下，不得不低头。
Either that or I won't have nothing to do.

402
00:17:14,046 --> 00:17:14,931
去做吧。
Come on.

00:17:19,427 --> 00:17:20,788
酸啊。
That hurt.

405
00:17:24,787 --> 00:17:26,146

You worked hard.

Yeah.

Because when you work that hard,

<i>熬出头不容易。</i>
you think about every dime you spend.

是。
That's right.

00:17:47,562 --> 00:17:49,020
付出多少，收获多少。
You earned every penny.

417

没有不劳而获的事情。
Don't forget to ice down your arms.

418
00:17:50,816 --> 00:17:52,392
可是那皮甲克要50元。
But I need $50 for the jacket.

419
00:17:52,393 --> 00:17:54,476
你想要的，和你能得到的，
No, you don't. You want $50.

420
00:17:54,477 --> 00:17:56,022
这是两码事情。
There's a difference.

421
00:17:56,521 --> 00:17:59,348
我求你给我买甲克的时候， 你要我去工作。
When I asked you for the jacket, you said I should get a job.

422
00:17:59,695 --> 00:18:00,912
现在，我做了工作……
And I got a job.

423
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,045
你做的还不够。
Job didn't pay enough.

424
00:18:03,046 --> 00:18:05,005
好啦，25元也不少啊。
You got $25.

425
00:18:05,006 --> 00:18:08,665
我一次挣25元钱，还是在30岁那年。
I didn't make my first $25 till I was 30 years old.

426
00:18:08,665 --> 00:18:10,435
多不容易啊。
And I still got two of 'em.

427
00:18:10,436 --> 00:18:11,245
想想，
Look, you want the jacket, save your money.

428
00:18:11,246 --> 00:18:12,591
你想买甲克。

429
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,162
你就必须继续存钱。
You can work with me again next week.

430
00:18:14,163 --> 00:18:15,857
下周还和我一起工作吗?

431
00:18:16,048 --> 00:18:17,244
好吧。
Okay.

432
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:25,841
再见，妈妈。
- Bye, Mommy. - See ya.

433
00:18:25,842 --> 00:18:26,842
再见。
Have a good day at school.

434
00:18:26,843 --> 00:18:28,417
在学校过得愉快点。

435
00:18:28,488 --> 00:18:29,783
<i>几天后，</i>
A few days later, Drew and Tonya were back in school

436
00:18:29,784 --> 00:18:31,436
<i>朱尔和塔尼亚回学校了。</i>

437
00:18:31,437 --> 00:18:34,473
<i>老妈又可以过她的快乐生活。</i>
and my mother could go back to her routine.

438
00:18:34,474 --> 00:18:37,699
<i>从没有见过一个女人这么快乐！</i>
I never seen a woman so happy to clean.

439
00:18:50,467 --> 00:18:54,269
<i>同时，我还在一边工作一边存钱。</i>
Meanwhile, I was still wishing that my job had worked out a little better.

440
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,178
<i>终于有天，我存够了钱。</i>
After all I'd gone through with my father,

441
00:18:56,179 --> 00:18:59,214
<i>谢天谢地，终于可以买皮甲克了。</i>
I appreciated him that much more.

442
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,492
你好，我喜欢我的甲克。
Hi, man.

443
00:19:03,493 --> 00:19:04,789
你也弄了一件。
- How do you like my jacket? - You got that one?

444
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:07,173
这是打折的最后一件。
I got the last one on sale.

445
00:19:10,153 --> 00:19:14,678
<i>看来，我起早贪黑的打工，都是白做了。</i>
But I didn't go out in the middle of the night

446
00:19:12,011 --> 00:19:13,773
and do all that work for nothing.

447
00:19:16,633 --> 00:19:19,427
<i>可分期付款</i>

448
00:19:23,443 --> 00:19:26,379
<i>六个月后</i>

449
00:19:26,692 --> 00:19:28,830
穿这么多不热吗？
Aren't you hot in that thing?

450
00:19:28,831 --> 00:19:30,705
别这样说，我很好。
Please. I'm fine.

451
00:19:32,361 --> 00:19:33,659
克里斯！
Chris?!

452
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:41,196
<i>本集结束，下周见！</i>
