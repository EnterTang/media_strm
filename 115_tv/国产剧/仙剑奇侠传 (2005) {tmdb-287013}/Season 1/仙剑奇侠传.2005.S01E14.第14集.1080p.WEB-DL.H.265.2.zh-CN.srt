1
00:00:05,756 --> 00:00:09,176
1983年是我作为一个青少年 所经历的第一个情人节。
<i>CHRIS ROCK: 1983 was my first Valentine's Day as a teenager.</i>

2
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:12,095
我以前从来没有在乎过情人节。
<i>I never really cared about Valentine's Day before,</i>

3
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,431
可是，现在我无法忽略它。
<i>but now I couldn't ignore it.</i>

4
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:18,519
情人节，让很多人想起鲜花和巧克力。
<i>Valentine's Day makes most people think</i>

5
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:22,022
但是对于我，我却想起了 芝加哥的黑社会。
<i>of flowers and candy,</i>

6
00:00:19,401 --> 00:00:22,667
<i>but it reminded me of the gangland massacre in Chicago.</i>

7
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,316
情人节快乐！！！ （玛丽莲.梦露1959年主演的电影《Some Like It Hot》）
Happy Valentine's Day.

8
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:34,034
昨天，这些玫瑰花要10美圆。
<i>Yesterday, those roses cost $10.</i>

9
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:36,578
现在，它们涨到110美圆。
Today, they're $110.

10
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:38,080
即使你孤单一人，你也应该找个女人，
<i>Even when you're broke,</i>

11
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,958
对她说，你爱她。
<i>you have to find a way to tell your woman you love her.</i>

12
00:00:40,567 --> 00:00:42,334
Hey!

13
00:00:43,171 --> 00:00:45,799
碰上我们算你倒霉，朋友！

14
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,799
即使换来一顿暴打。
You picked the wrong wall today.

15
00:00:46,667 --> 00:00:49,367
<i>Even if it means getting the crap beat out of you.</i>

16
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:52,135
情人节，连空气里都充满了爱意。
<i>On Valentine's Day, love was in the air.</i>

17
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,972
你应该看看他们是多么亲热！
<i>You should have seen what they did after they shot him.</i>

18
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,894
情人节快乐，这是给你的。
Hey.

19
00:00:58,501 --> 00:01:00,667
Hi. Happy Valentine's Day.

20
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:03,939
即使在学校里，情人节也是一件大事。
<i>Even at school, Valentine's Day was a big deal,</i>

21
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:07,150
看起来每个人都收到了礼物。 除了我。
<i>and it seemed like everybody</i>

22
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:08,485
还有时间，
<i>was getting something except me.</i>

23
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,820
我们还有机会可以收到卡片。
Still a few days to go.

24
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:10,821
言下之意是， 如果我们不是好兄弟，
We could still get a card.

25
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,615
我一定要抢你的女友。
<i>That look means, "If we weren't friends,</i>

26
00:01:11,967 --> 00:01:13,667
<i>I'd smack the hope out of you."</i>

27
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,410
我的来了，我有一张情人卡。
Hey, I got one. I got a Valentine's Day card.

28
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:17,578
酷。
Cool.

29
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,831
连我都有卡，你的也会来的。
Hey, if I got a card,

30
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:22,249
上面写什么？
I know you will.

31
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:22,100
What's it say?

32
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,002
（人人都恨克里斯）

33
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,379
玫瑰鲜，糖果甜，
Roses are red, violets are blue, you stink like a monkey

34
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,882
你这只臭猴，人人嫌。
and look like one, too.

35
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:31,341
节日快乐！
Happy Valey.

36
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,635
空气里都是“爱”啊！（倒霉）
<i>So much for love in the air.</i>

37
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,964
我13岁的时候，没有女朋友。
<i>CHRIS ROCK: I didn't have any luck with girls when I was 13.</i>

38
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:13,217
但我却暗恋过许多女孩。
<i>Mostly, I just had a bunch of crushes.</i>

39
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,802
为什么只能暗恋，因为机会天天有，
<i>They call it a crush, because chances are</i>

40
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:18,472
可是，一旦我开口，换来的却是“心碎”。
<i>if you open your mouth, you're gonna get crushed.</i>

41
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:19,973
她们用各种理由拒绝我，
<i>They could have called it, "She don't like you, stupid,"</i>

42
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,475
比如“我不喜欢傻瓜。”
<i>but "crush" is just quicker.</i>

43
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,477
这让我的心碎更加彻底。

44
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,897
那是甜姐布朗。
<i>That's Tangee Brown.</i>

45
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,316
嗨！
Hi.

46
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:31,652
她只对我说过一句话，就是：嗨。
<i>All she ever said to me was "hi."</i>

47
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,070
但这就足够了。
<i>That's all I needed.</i>

48
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,239
从那天开始，她成了我的“大巴情人”（暗恋）。
<i>After that, she became my Bus Crush.</i>

49
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,868
叫她“大巴情人”，是因为 我经常在大巴上碰到她。
<i>I call it a Bus Crush</i>

50
00:02:38,554 --> 00:02:40,221
<i>because this one happened on a bus.</i>

51
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,080
以前，我还有“电梯情人”。
<i>One time I had an Elevator Crush.</i>

52
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:47,668
为了在她面前装酷， 我差点被电梯夹掉了脑袋。
<i>I almost lost my head trying to follow her around.</i>

53
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,753
这是我的“后窗情人”。
<i>There was my Window Crush.</i>

54
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:54,758
从此之后，她一见我就紧张。
<i>The laws about that were a lot more relaxed at the time.</i>

55
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:57,427
关于我的“大巴情人”，我必须指出：
<i>There was only one problem with my Bus Crush--</i>

56
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:58,929
她有男朋友。
<i>she had a boyfriend.</i>

57
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:01,682
也许我笨，可你连脑子都没有。
Why I got to be stupid?

58
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,934
以后我们各走各的路，你别缠着我。
You're the one who lost your hat.

59
00:03:01,887 --> 00:03:03,020
I lost it because I was trying to keep you

60
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,103
－你现在要甩我了？ －是的。甜姐。
from getting on the wrong bus.

61
00:03:04,087 --> 00:03:05,421
Oh, so I'm dumb now?

62
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,604
我不会在乎你了。
Yeah, Tangee.

63
00:03:06,454 --> 00:03:08,020
And you're getting on my nerves.

64
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:11,233
克莱德，把我的书还给我。
Clyde, you still got my books.

65
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,359
拿去。
Here.

66
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:14,778
你一个人拿回去看个够吧。
You need to read them.

67
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,198
这真像坐山观虎斗。
Maybe they'll teach you how to act.

68
00:03:14,954 --> 00:03:16,753
<i>This must be how the drummer felt</i>

69
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,521
<i>watching Ike and Tina fight.</i>

70
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,033
谢谢。
Thank you.

71
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,451
想坐下来吗？
You want to sit down?

72
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,370
－不用，我站着就好。 －坐吧，没关系。
No, that's okay.

73
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:24,580
我喜欢站在门口。
Oh, no, it's all right. I like to stand.

74
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,456
多谢你。
Thanks.

75
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,210
此时，就算有人高价卖我一张终月票， 我也愿意买！（高兴！）
<i>At that moment, somebody could have sold me</i>

76
00:03:28,554 --> 00:03:30,753
<i>a lifetime bus pass.</i>

77
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:33,964
我爱你。

78
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:36,466
我老妈最爱情人节。
<i>My mother loved Valentine's Day, and why not?</i>

79
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,634
这理所当然。
<i>I learned early on, Valentine's Day is not a day for couples.</i>

80
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:41,054
我早就知道，情人节不是情侣的节日，

81
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:42,723
而是女人的节日。
<i>It's a day for women.</i>

82
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:45,642
如果女人空着手出现在男人家门口，
<i>If a woman shows up at a man's door empty-handed, big deal.</i>

83
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:46,894
这没有关系。
<i>But if a man shows up empty-handed,</i>

84
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:49,521
如果男人空着手出现，

85
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:51,732
也许，他再也没有机会出现在这里了。
<i>he may as well not have shown up at all.</i>

86
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,150
你这个猪头！
Die, you pig!

87
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,902
我可不是吓唬你们。
<i>He won't forget next year.</i>

88
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,069
你好！
ROCHELLE: Hello?

89
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:58,989
朱尔在家吗？ 朱尔现在没空，
GIRL: Can I talk to Drew?

90
00:03:59,072 --> 00:03:59,990
我们在吃饭。
No, Drew can't come to the phone right now.

91
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,909
可现在是情人节?
We're having dinner.

92
00:04:00,254 --> 00:04:01,354
I'm his Valentine.

93
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,994
什么？
His who?

94
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:03,321
His Valentine. His only Valentine.

95
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,495
好了，再见。
Okay, bye.

96
00:04:05,387 --> 00:04:07,920
Drew, you need to tell these fast little girls

97
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:11,502
朱尔，你必须告诉那些女孩，没事别往这里打电话， 害我们晚上不得安宁。
to stop this house all hours of the day and night.

98
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,420
－我告诉她们了，妈妈。 －那就再说一遍。
I told them already,

99
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:17,257
这些女孩打电话说什么“情人节……”之类的话，
Well, tell them again.

100
00:04:13,688 --> 00:04:15,753
They're all calling here talking about, "Well, tell him

101
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,187
his Valentine called."

102
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,843
－把我烦死了。 －放松一点。
I don't have time for that mess.

103
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,512
看我们的小鬼多受欢迎啊！
Relax. Boy can't help it if he's popular.

104
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,848
－克里斯，到现在为止，你收了几张情人卡？ －没有。
TONYA: Chris, how many Valentine cards

105
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,683
为什么女孩都不喜欢你？
did you get so far?

106
00:04:24,487 --> 00:04:25,588
None.

107
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,310
因为这不关你的事。别废话。
How come girls don't like you?

108
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,270
-别把气出在我头上。 -嘿嘿嘿。
Because none of your business, that's why.

109
00:04:28,454 --> 00:04:29,487
Don't get mad at me.

110
00:04:29,554 --> 00:04:30,354
JULIUS: Hey, hey, hey.

111
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,858
妈，能帮我做一张情人卡吗？
Mama, can you help me make

112
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,109
对，自己做。
a Valentine's Day card?

113
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,612
这才是我的乖女，帮老爸省钱。
JULIUS: A homemade card.

114
00:04:36,454 --> 00:04:38,853
That's my little girl, saving that money.

115
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,697
好的，宝贝。送给谁呢？
Sure, baby.

116
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,282
我男友。
Who's it for?

117
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,720
My boyfriend.

118
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,371
你男友? 看看我们的女儿多受欢迎啊！？
Your what friend?

119
00:04:45,187 --> 00:04:48,054
Well, the girl can't help it if she's popular.

120
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,377
你从哪儿找的男友？ 学校里。
Where'd you get a boyfriend?

121
00:04:52,154 --> 00:04:53,187
At school.

122
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,755
妈妈，能帮我找个地方存放情人卡吗？
DREW: Hey, Ma, do you have

123
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,920
a place where I can put all my Valentine's Day cards?

124
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,215
你准备送很多吗？
How many you giving out, boy?

125
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,092
哦，不是。
Well, I'm not really giving them out.

126
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:03,220
－是太多女孩子不停地送卡给我。 －小子，好样的！
Girls just keep on giving them to me.

127
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,621
My man.

128
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:06,139
女孩子就应该给男孩送卡。
Are girls supposed to give boys Valentine's Day cards?

129
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,391
她们是给他的。
Well, they're giving them to him.

130
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:08,851
你为什么不送我一张？
What's that got to do to with me?

131
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,229
你交男友多久了？
How long have you had a boyfriend?

132
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,647
就一周。
Just for a week.

133
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,233
－罗笑！你管管她。 －朱立业斯！别多事。
Rochelle?

134
00:05:15,221 --> 00:05:16,287
Julius.

135
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,695
我也收到了一张情人卡， 可上面写的却是：
I wish somebody would give me

136
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:20,821
“我恨你”
a Valentine's Day card that says something besides "I hate you."

137
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,240
如果你想要，你可以从我这里拿一张。
Well, if you want,

138
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,993
我再衰，也不能接受“二手礼物”。
you can have one of mine.

139
00:05:23,853 --> 00:05:25,554
<i>And I thought getting his hand-me-downs was bad.</i>

140
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,578
不用了。谢谢你。
Mm, no, thank you.

141
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,747
那张“我恨你”卡，是谁给你的。
Who gave you a card that said "I hate you"?

142
00:05:29,987 --> 00:05:32,654
Oh, I don't know.

143
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:33,333
哦，我不知道。
It's just a stupid joke.

144
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,002
只是个愚蠢的玩笑罢了。

145
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,212
虽然我不喜欢克鲁塞，
<i>Even though I didn't like Caruso,</i>

146
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:40,132
但我不认为他应该遭到我老妈的“诅咒”。
<i>I didn't think he deserved to be cursed out by my mother.</i>

147
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:43,760
虽然老爸不浪漫，
<i>Even though my father wasn't romantic,</i>

148
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:45,262
但他也不笨。
<i>he wasn't stupid, either.</i>

149
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,265
他有个鞋盒，里面装满了问候卡。
<i>He had a shoebox full of greeting cards in the house.</i>

150
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,101
这足够他在任何场合应付我老妈。
<i>He could give my mother a card for any occasion.</i>

151
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,353
结婚周年快乐！
<i>Happy Anniversary.</i>

152
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:57,024
哦，你让我感到惊喜！
Aw, you shouldn't have.

153
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,067
国旗日快乐！
<i>Happy Flag Day.</i>

154
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,946
哦，你让我感到惊喜！
Oh, you shouldn't have.

155
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:04,448
光明节(犹太人一纪念节日)快乐！
<i>Happy Chanukah.</i>

156
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:08,493
哦，你让我感到惊喜！
Oh, you shouldn't have.

157
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,871
他曾经在这个盒子里藏了糖果。
<i>He used to keep candy under the bed, too,</i>

158
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,456
可惜被老鼠啃光了。
<i>but the mice kept eating it.</i>

159
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,298
.嘿，宝贝。 .
Hey, babe.

160
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,217
这是给你的。
Hey, baby.

161
00:06:21,753 --> 00:06:23,120
This is for you.

162
00:06:23,187 --> 00:06:27,621
Baby, it's not even Valentine's Day yet.

163
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,554
宝贝，现在还没有到情人节呢。

164
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,933
我知道。但这是一份特别的祝福。
I know, but... every day is special with you.

165
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,753
Oh, Julius, you didn't have to.

166
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,561
你真让我感到惊喜！

167
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,147
说你爱我。
But since you did...

168
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:41,151
你看现在发生了什么？
You see all this right here? You see that?

169
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:42,277
看到了吧。
That's why Tonya don't need to be running around here

170
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:43,987
想想我们的塔尼亚，

171
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,822
她居然也有男友了！
talking about she got a boyfriend.

172
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,325
朱立业斯，她才刚刚 10 岁呢。
Julius, she's ten years old.

173
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,827
那只是她们班上的小男生，没什么大不了的。
He's just a boy in her class.

174
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,371
想想那些电视新闻，
It's not big deal.

175
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,164
那些女孩10岁就有小孩了。
Rochelle, do you watch the news?

176
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:55,833
而且，20岁就有孙子了。
Girls are having babies at ten.

177
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,335
朱立业斯，你不用担心她。
<i>And grandbabies at 20.</i>

178
00:06:56,154 --> 00:06:58,421
Drew is the one you need to be worried about.

179
00:06:58,836 --> 00:06:59,920
为什么？
What for?

180
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,714
做父母，就要对小孩加强管教。
So a few girls like him.

181
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,720
There's nothing wrong with that.

182
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,174
朱尔才11岁，
He's 11.

183
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:05,926
他只比塔尼亚大一岁。
He's only one year older than Tonya.

184
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:08,345
你却用双重标准对待他们。
What is the difference?

185
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,013
她是个女孩。
She is a girl.

186
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:14,351
宝贝，你不可能处处防范，面面俱到。
Baby, you cannot protect Tonya from everything.

187
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:15,644
要打赌吗？
You wanna bet?

188
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,271
好好看着。
Watch me.

189
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:18,897
我就要处处防范！
I'll protect her from everything.

190
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:19,526
严防死堵！
Everything.

191
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,526
这很明显，老爸早就部署了作战计划。
<i>It was clear that my father already had a plan.</i>

192
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,445
爸爸这是朗诺，我的未婚夫。 （十年后。）
Daddy, this is Ronald.

193
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:26,905
先生，很高兴见到你。
My fianc?

194
00:07:25,753 --> 00:07:26,720
Nice to meet you, sir.

195
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:34,538
妈妈， 老爸又把我的未婚夫打飞了。
Mama! Daddy shot my fianc?again.

196
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:38,375
爱谁谁！ 这就是完美的爱女保护计划。
<i>Hey, say what you want, but that's effective birth control.</i>

197
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:42,629
嘿，为什么女孩喜欢那些对她不好的坏男孩？
Hey, why do girls like guys that are mean to them?

198
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,339
好好男生已经落伍了。
Nice guys finish last.

199
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:46,717
也许是坏男生捉弄好男生，
Maybe the mean guys beat the crap out of the nice guys

200
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,428
女孩子看见了很开心。
so when the girls show up no one else is around.

201
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,888
你对她说了什么？
Did you say anything to her?

202
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:54,308
我帮她把书捡起来，还让位子给她坐。
I picked up her books and I offered her a seat.

203
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:55,684
哦，大哥，你真是情圣！
Oh, man, this is major.

204
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,144
－她叫什么名字。 －甜姐。
What's her name? Tangee.

205
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,313
格莱格，这是给你的。
Greg, this is for you.

206
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,900
请等我走了之后再打开，
Please don't open it until I leave.

207
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,110
－好吗？ －没问题。
Promise? Okay.

208
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:08,906
终于有情人卡了。
Valentine's Day card?

209
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,116
上面写着“做我的男友吧”
It says "Be mine."

210
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,576
爽耶！
Okay.

211
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,870
瞧瞧！
Yeah.

212
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:18,207
这个情人节真酷！
Man, "Be my Valentine," that's so cool.

213
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,126
哦，你又来了一张。
Hey, look, you got one, too.

214
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:27,007
玫瑰鲜，糖果甜，
"Roses are red, violets are blue...

215
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,928
人人恨你一千年！
cupid hates your guts, and I do, too."

216
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:34,264
噢！至少这次比上次更压韵。
Well, at this time he wrote a poem.

217
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:41,605
每次和甜姐在大巴上邂逅的时候，
<i>I never knew when I'd see Tangee on the bus,</i>

218
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:44,274
我都会心潮澎湃。
<i>so I was always excited when I saw her get on.</i>

219
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:45,943
－让我走。 －不。
Let me go! No.

220
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:49,196
不幸的是，她每次也同样是“心潮澎湃”的。
<i>Unfortunately, she was always excited, too.</i>

221
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,739
不是快乐的“心潮澎湃”，
<i>Not happy excited,</i>

222
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,950
而是愤怒的“心潮澎湃”。
<i>more like "hold me back" excited.</i>

223
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,619
看看你这个混球…………
Look what you did to my jacket.

224
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,621
我说过，我不想在巴士上碰到你…………
It's all stretched out.

225
00:08:55,853 --> 00:08:57,421
You got on the bus like I told you, it wouldn't have happened.

226
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,040
你又不是我老爸，我为什么要听你的？
You ain't my daddy.

227
00:08:58,521 --> 00:08:59,853
I don't have to do what you say.

228
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,542
你有种就再推我一下！！
Push me again and see what happens.

229
00:09:01,688 --> 00:09:04,221
Hey. Leave her alone.

230
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:04,545
－嘿！别烦她了。 －什么？
What?

231
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:06,046
别装聋作哑，
You heard him.

232
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:07,756
你现在想怎样？
What you gonna do now?

233
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,634
嘿！就不用你来煽风点火了。
<i>Hey, I don't need any help getting my ass whupped.</i>

234
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,553
那是我最拿手的一件事。
<i>That's the one thing I'm good at.</i>

235
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:16,254
* Everybody ha-ates Chris *

236
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,523
别多管闲事。
???

237
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,233
现在是进退两难啊!
<i>CHRIS ROCK: I couldn't back down now.</i>

238
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:28,735
只能硬着头皮顶上去了。
<i>I was scared if I moved I might pee myself.</i>

239
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,070
不！
No.

240
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,865
小鬼，从我的大巴上滚下去。
Get the hell off my bus, boy.

241
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:35,200
－好的。 －不是说你。
Okay.

242
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,160
你，快滚。
Not you. You.

243
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,079
为什么要我滚？是他挑头的。
Come on, let's go.

244
00:09:37,254 --> 00:09:38,287
Why I got to get off?

245
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,748
别瞎说。根本就不是他。
He started it.

246
00:09:39,521 --> 00:09:41,920
Quit lying. He ain't start nothing.

247
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:44,209
－你就不能闭嘴吗？ －要我再说一遍？快滚！
Why don't you quit lying?

248
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,454
I said get off.

249
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:46,003
滚！
Now move.

250
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,927
你想坐下吗？
You want to sit down?

251
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:55,804
好吧。
Sure.

252
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:00,017
为什么帮我？
Why'd you do that?

253
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,603
不知道。我没有考虑那么多。
I don't know. I wasn't thinking, I guess.

254
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:04,938
我老爸说，你应该要帮助女生。
My father said you're not supposed to hit a girl.

255
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:07,274
－你相信你老爸说的话？ －是啊。
You know your father?

256
00:10:06,354 --> 00:10:08,154
Yeah.

257
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,528
从没有人为我挺身而出。
Nobody's ever looked out for me like that before.

258
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,447
－你叫什么？ －克里斯。
What's your name? Chris.

259
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:22,080
我叫甜姐。
I'm Tangee.

260
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:23,832
给你。
Here.

261
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,251
一张情人卡？
A Valentine's Day card?

262
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:27,294
是啊。
<i>TANGEE: Yeah.</i>

263
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:30,214
刚才那个混蛋让我觉得恶心。
I was going to give it to Clyde, but he makes me sick.

264
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:31,882
谢谢。
Thanks.

265
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,176
真棒！我的第一个情人节。
<i>This was great, my first Valentine's.</i>

266
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,720
虽然我两手空空，什么也没送给她，
<i>So what if it was meant for a future wife beater?</i>

267
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:38,222
但她没有向电视里那样痛扁我。
<i>He ain't beat me.</i>

268
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,392
朱尔在家吗？
Hi. Is Drew home?

269
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:45,229
你知道现在已经超过八点半了吗？
Do you realize it's 8:30 at night?

270
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:46,480
朱尔已经睡觉了。
Drew is in bed.

271
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,357
他才11岁。
He is 11.

272
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,317
他 才 十 一 岁 ！
E-L-E-V-E-N. 11.

273
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:51,693
11岁
I... Go home.

274
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:52,903
回家吧。
If I see you around my child again,

275
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,322
如果我看到你接近我的孩子，
I'm calling the cops.

276
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,281
懂了吗？
You got that? Yeah, I-I...

277
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:59,910
………… 不用解释，我明白。
Okay, I know, I know, girl, I know.

278
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:01,703
又灭掉一个。
Beat it.

279
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,083
这是我最喜欢的。
Ooh, these are my favorites.

280
00:11:06,454 --> 00:11:08,653
Mmm! Mm-mm-mm.

281
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,088
－再见爸爸。 －再见儿子。
DREW: All right, bye, Dad.

282
00:11:09,954 --> 00:11:11,287
See you later, son.

283
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:14,424
你好久没有来我们学校了。
Daddy, you haven't walked us to school in a long time.

284
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,176
我知道，是很久了。
I know. It's been a while.

285
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,429
你今天不是休息吗？
Aren't you supposed to be sleeping?

286
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,932
我过一会就休息。
Yeah. I can get my rest later.

287
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,852
妈妈说你最不喜欢学校。
Mama said you don't like walking us to school.

288
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,520
她瞎说。
That's not true.

289
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:28,397
想要几毛钱吗？
You want a dollar?

290
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,687
All right.

291
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:31,733
.给你。
There you go.

292
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,653
既然我在这里，
Hey, since I'm here,

293
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:38,115
不如你指给我看，谁是你的男友？
why don't you show me which one of these kids

294
00:11:37,121 --> 00:11:38,421
is your boyfriend.

295
00:11:38,488 --> 00:11:40,887
Oh, um... there he is.

296
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,869
就是他。杰克！
James!

297
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:45,706
代我向他问好。
So that's him, huh?

298
00:11:45,321 --> 00:11:46,920
Yeah.

299
00:11:46,987 --> 00:11:48,488
All right.

300
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:52,171
－再见，爸爸。 －再见，宝贝。
Bye, Daddy.

301
00:11:50,987 --> 00:11:53,321
All right, bye, baby.

302
00:11:57,885 --> 00:11:59,678
我要和你谈谈。
Can I talk to you for a minute?

303
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,055
－和我？
Who, me?

304
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:03,223
过来。
Yeah, you.

305
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:04,391
你叫什么名字？
Get over here.

306
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,560
我的名字叫“你管不着”
What's your name?

307
00:12:04,753 --> 00:12:06,588
My name is "Don't worry about what my name is."

308
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,854
你以为你是大众情人？
What, you think you're some kind

309
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,314
我不知道你是什么意思？
of ladies' man or something?

310
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,149
连这也不懂？
I don't know any ladies.

311
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:14,151
……不……不懂。
They're not even No. Uh, I don't know...ou?

312
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:16,570
－你是谁？ －别管我是谁。
Who are you?

313
00:12:15,287 --> 00:12:16,720
Don't worry about who I am.

314
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,072
你今天甭想收到什么情人卡了。
Worry about who you're giving them cards to.

315
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:21,992
－我要我妈妈 －你是妈妈的乖宝宝？
I want my mama.

316
00:12:20,488 --> 00:12:21,954
So you a mama's boy?

317
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:23,160
－是啊。
Yes.

318
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,829
听着，乖宝宝，离我女儿远点儿，
Well, listen up, mama's boy.

319
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:26,997
听见了吗！
You stay away from my daughter, you hear me?

320
00:12:26,488 --> 00:12:27,887
Huh?

321
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,293
嘿，不许哭！
Hey, man, stop that.

322
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,004
不许哭！
MAN: Hey, stay away from that boy!

323
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:36,924
－离那个孩子远点。 －我只是和他聊聊天。
Get out of here!

324
00:12:35,653 --> 00:12:37,421
JULIUS: I was just talking to him.

325
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:38,884
他不愿意和你聊天。
MAN: Hey, you, I'm talking to you!

326
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:42,638
老爸今天去了塔尼亚的学校，
<i>CHRIS ROCK: While my father was getting rid of Tonya's valentine,</i>

327
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:44,932
我真希望他能来这里。
<i>I wish he'd been around to get rid of mine.</i>

328
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:50,604
糖果鲜，玫瑰秀，
"Roses are red, violets are blue...

329
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:56,068
带你老妈回非洲！
"Please go back to Africa

330
00:12:54,421 --> 00:12:56,488
"and take your mother with you.

331
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,195
情人节快乐！
Happy Valentine's Day."

332
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,115
如果再收到这样的卡， 我真想立马去非洲。
<i>CHRIS ROCK: Another card like this, and I might just go to Africa.</i>

333
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:05,994
你又躲在墙旁边？
What's wrong with you?

334
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,080
我只是想避开卓依。
I'm trying not to bump into Joy again.

335
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:11,708
学校就这么大，躲也没用。
The school's only but so big.

336
00:13:09,954 --> 00:13:11,554
You're bound to run into her sometimes.

337
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:12,876
我太紧张了，最好别碰见她。
I just don't want to blow it.

338
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,211
我不知道下一步怎么办？
I don't know what my next move is.

339
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,213
－你没有送卡给她？ －没有。
Well, did you get her a card?

340
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:17,965
那就送一张吧。
No. Then that's your next move.

341
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:19,758
你可以和我一起来。
You can come with me.

342
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:21,969
－我也准备送一张卡。 －给谁的？
I was going to go get one anyway.

343
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,972
巴士上的女孩。她昨天给我一张。
For who?

344
00:13:22,254 --> 00:13:23,554
The girl on the bus.

345
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:26,223
还没听你说过啊？
She gave me one yesterday.

346
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,474
虽然我收到情人卡比你早一步，
And you didn't tell me?

347
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:30,310
可你小子有大事也不能瞒着我啊。
I know I go to bed early, but you could still call

348
00:13:28,354 --> 00:13:30,387
and wake me up when something this important happens.

349
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:32,271
我现在就准备告诉你的。
Yeah, well, I wanted to tell you in person.

350
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:35,190
－我在他男朋友动粗之前，英雄救美…… －你英雄救美？
I broke up a fight between her and her boyfriend.

351
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:37,150
是啊，她就给我了一张卡。
You broke up a fight?

352
00:13:35,387 --> 00:13:37,354
Yeah, and she gave me this card.

353
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:38,735
帅哥，这绝对是惊天地，泣鬼神！
Dude, this is huge.

354
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:40,445
这么伟大？我不知道。
Is it? I-I don't know.

355
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:42,906
我只是得到了一张卡。
It... it's just a card.

356
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,992
这卡的意思是：我属于你，来吧！
A card is, "I'm yours for the taking."

357
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:47,578
在你收到卡之前，你是怎么做的？
How in there do you have to be before you get it?

358
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,872
甜姐送卡给我的时候，
Why is it that when it comes to me,

359
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:51,874
我有点不知所措。你知道的，
you know so much about girls,

360
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:54,084
当别人送卡给你的时候，你总会有点紧张的。
but you freak out when one gives you a card?

361
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:57,004
我猜着第一次都会紧张的。
I guess it's kind of like not being able

362
00:13:55,887 --> 00:13:56,887
to cut your own hair.

363
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:00,424
在你给女孩送礼物之前，
<i>CHRIS ROCK: Before you ever buy a girl a gift,</i>

364
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:03,343
你应该送她一张完美的卡片。
<i>the first thing you've got to do is buy her the perfect card.</i>

365
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:05,095
这过火了。
Nah, that's too much.

366
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,889
你们都没有亲过呢。
You haven't even kissed her yet.

367
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:08,140
你有吗？
Have you?

368
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:11,351
那，这个呢?
Um...

369
00:14:09,887 --> 00:14:11,687
how about this one?

370
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:12,728
（我的女王）
"You know the deal.

371
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:16,690
你知道的，我想你做我的情人。

372
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,187
I want you to be my valentine."

373
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:19,401
这个很酷，但更适合普通男女。
That's cool, but it's more for a friend than a girl.

374
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:21,361
噢，这张好！
Whoa, cool.

375
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:26,200
相对而言，我希望你做我的情人。
"Relatively speaking,

376
00:14:24,588 --> 00:14:26,187
would you be my valentine?"

377
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,326
这才是最好的。
This is perfect.

378
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:29,786
给甜姐？不了，不合适。
For Tangee? No thanks.

379
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,288
不，是给卓伊的。
No, for Joy.

380
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,373
格莱格总是有好人缘。
<i>CHRIS ROCK: Greg never fought being a nerd.</i>

381
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:35,626
这让我想不通。
<i>I always wondered how that worked out for him.</i>

382
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:41,715
快点，甜心！
Come on, honey!

383
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:48,388
－格莱格，什么时候换了车？ －同事借给我的。
Greg, when did you get this car?

384
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,287
Well, the Bentley's in the shop.

385
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,647
我更喜欢这张。
I kind of like this one.

386
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:57,773
（做我的情人！）

387
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:01,735
大哥，这卡太贵了
Dude, this card is $2.50.

388
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:04,988
嘿，这个时候可不能小气。
Hey, you've got to pay to play, right?

389
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:10,702
快，把卡拿来。
Quick, give me my card.

390
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:12,579
给你。
Here.

391
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:15,916
－送给你的。 －谢谢！
Here.

392
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:14,887
This is for you.

393
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:16,959
别，别，别。
Thank you.

394
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:18,919
－回家再看。 －好。
No, no, no, no.

395
00:15:17,054 --> 00:15:18,087
Read it when you get home.

396
00:15:18,154 --> 00:15:19,488
Okay.

397
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,423
啊，刚才真紧张。
Man, that was close.

398
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:25,425
噢。
What's this?

399
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:28,011
哈哈，我收够了。
Oh, ha, ha, very funny.

400
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:33,016
克里斯、
Chris!

401
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,685
为什么要这样？
How could you?

402
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:37,104
我看到克努斯戏弄你，
When I found out how Caruso had been teasing you,

403
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:40,440
我本来想给一张真的贺卡来安慰你的。
I thought you'd appreciate a real valentine from someone.

404
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,442
看来，我多事了。
Obviously, I was wrong.

405
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:45,279
如今，老师们才不会给你的孩子送卡。
<i>CHRIS ROCK: Nowadays, you wish all the teacher gave your kids</i>

406
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:47,614
我不知道你是送给我的。
<i>were cards.</i>

407
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,687
I didn't know it was yours.

408
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,451
我在学校里越来越不受欢迎，
<i>While I couldn't have been less popular, back at home,</i>

409
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:54,496
可在家里，朱尔却越来越吃香。
<i>Drew couldn't have been more popular.</i>

410
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:58,876
你好。
Hello?

411
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,669
告诉朱尔，情人节快乐！
GIRL: Hey, is my valentine home yet?

412
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:02,629
不，朱尔还没有回家。
No, Drew is still outside playing.

413
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:04,214
别再往这里打电话了。
Stop calling here!

414
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,383
什么？什么？
What's wrong, what's wrong?

415
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:08,886
这些电话让我心绪不宁。
All these girls calling.

416
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,854
It's getting on my nerves.

417
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:11,221
已经有很多人要约他，
I already have enough to deal with.

418
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:13,891
你能想象学校门口有多少女孩接他放学吗？
Can you believe

419
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,121
there's some maniac at the school

420
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:15,976
看来，我必须去亲自接他。
threatening the kids?

421
00:16:14,454 --> 00:16:16,020
I've got to go pick them up from school today.

422
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,812
至少，朱尔在学校里可以保护塔尼亚。
Well, at least Drew's there to protect Tonya.

423
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:21,732
我们应该怎样处理这个问题？
Now, what are we going to do about Drew and these girls?

424
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:23,650
（装聋作哑）
Huh?

425
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:27,487
每过五分钟就有人来，不是打电话就是敲门，
What?

426
00:16:23,687 --> 00:16:25,187
Julius, every five minutes,

427
00:16:25,254 --> 00:16:27,354
some girl is calling or knocking at the door.

428
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:30,657
朱尔这么小就招峰引蝶……
Drew is way too young to get this much attention.

429
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:32,993
这没什么大不了的。
Rochelle, it's nothing, okay?

430
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,787
朱尔已经11岁了。
Drew's only 11 years old.

431
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:37,581
再说，你也管不了那些女孩。
He don't care nothing about those girls.

432
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:40,375
现在，有的男孩在12岁就当爸爸了。
Boys are becoming fathers even at age 12.

433
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:42,878
在43岁当外祖父。
<i>CHRIS ROCK: And great-grandfathers at 43.</i>

434
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:44,755
放松点。
Baby, relax.

435
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:46,006
别担心。
Don't worry about it.

436
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:47,466
你是不操心。
You don't worry about it,

437
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:50,385
可我不想这么早当奶奶。
'cause I ain't about to let nobody call me Grandmama.

438
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,262
因为老妈抱着这种想法，
<i>CHRIS ROCK: With my mother on the job,</i>

439
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:54,973
所以，我在33岁才有女朋友。
<i>I didn't get a girl till I was 33.</i>

440
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:58,602
这个时候，朱尔刚刚结束聚会。
<i>Meanwhile, Drew had more girls than an Usher after-party.</i>

441
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:04,274
－情人节快乐！朱。 －谢谢，米雪儿。
Happy Valentine's Day, Drew.

442
00:17:03,087 --> 00:17:04,354
Oh, thank you, Miss Johnson.

443
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,779
虽然在学校很不爽，
<i>CHRIS ROCK: As bad as my Valentine's Day had been going, I knew</i>

444
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:12,282
但一想起我的“巴士情人”，烦恼就一扫而空。
<i>I could count on my bus crush to make it all right.</i>

445
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:14,993
嘿，克里斯，我给你占了座位。
Hey, Chris, I saved you a seat.

446
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,164
多谢。
Thanks.

447
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:23,961
能问你个问题吗？
Can I ask you something?

448
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:27,631
你为什么总和那个讨厌鬼在一起？
What?

449
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,620
How come you go with a guy that you always fight with?

450
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:29,800
我和他结束了。
I'm not going with him anymore.

451
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:31,218
他是个猪头。
He's stupid.

452
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:32,845
我可以放心了。
<i>CHRIS ROCK: That's all I needed to hear.</i>

453
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:35,222
嘿，送你一个礼物。
Hey, I got you something.

454
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:37,099
哦，你真好。
Really? That's so sweet.

455
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:38,892
东西呢？
What else?

456
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:40,978
什么东西？
What else, what?

457
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,396
你不是要送我礼物？
Where's the gift?

458
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:43,981
我只是想送你一张卡。
I only got you a card.

459
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,065
就这个？
That's it?

460
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:46,483
今天是情人节啊！！！
It's Valentine's Day,

461
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:49,194
你就这么小气，只给我一张破卡？
and all you got me was this cheap-ass card?

462
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:51,405
我们才刚认识啊。
I-I-I just met you.

463
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:52,531
那，鲜花呢？
So? Where's the flowers?

464
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:54,408
糖果呢？
Where's the candy?

465
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:57,494
我还以为我们很有缘分， 我还以为你很重视我。
I thought I meant something to you.

466
00:17:57,578 --> 00:18:00,414
早知道我还不如待在学校里，
I thought we had a connection.

467
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,720
You know, I could have stayed

468
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:00,221
with Clyde's sorry ass

469
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:02,040
以后再也不理睬你。
if this is how you were going to treat me.

470
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:04,418
－能不能小声点？ －你还叫我小声点，
Can you please quiet down?

471
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:06,170
你为什么不小声点。
You don't tell me to be quiet.

472
00:18:04,421 --> 00:18:06,321
Why don't you be quiet?

473
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:07,171
不如直接说，闭嘴！
Better yet, shut up!

474
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:08,297
要我小声点，
Tell me to be quiet.

475
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,007
你又不是我老爸。
You ain't my daddy!

476
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:14,845
这个倒霉的情人节让我哭笑不得……
<i>CHRIS ROCK: Getting cursed out on a bus</i>

477
00:18:11,787 --> 00:18:14,687
<i>is not really how I expected to end my Valentine's Day,</i>

478
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:16,513
但这证实了我的观点。
<i>but it did prove my point.</i>

479
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:19,016
越“倾心”，越“伤心”。
<i>If you have a crush, you get crushed.</i>

480
00:18:18,753 --> 00:18:20,187
This is nothing but a piece of paper!

481
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:24,354
真希望司机能把我赶下车。
I don't need this!

482
00:18:21,653 --> 00:18:22,854
<i>CHRIS ROCK: Now, where was the bus driver</i>

483
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,254
<i>with a bat when you needed him?</i>

484
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:26,607
……
And I'd kiss your little funky cheek,

485
00:18:25,753 --> 00:18:26,987
but I could have stayed with Clyde.

486
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:30,694
把你这张不值钱的废纸拿走，我不需要……
Here, take back your stupid card.

487
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:36,533
朱尔，你必须把这张卡退给蔷森女士。
Drew, you got to return these cards to Miss Johnson.

488
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:41,872
30岁，还结过婚，居然送卡给我们11岁的孩子。
A 30-year-old married woman

489
00:18:39,087 --> 00:18:41,321
giving cards to my 11-year-old son.

490
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:44,041
那这些糖果怎么办？
What about the candy?

491
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,586
我们还是写一张卡回去拒绝她。
I think sending

492
00:18:46,054 --> 00:18:48,620
the cards back makes the point.

493
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,133
虽然甜姐不要我的卡，
<i>CHRIS ROCK: Giving the card to Tangee didn't work out,</i>

494
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:56,970
－但我老妈肯定很高兴能收到卡。 －谢谢，宝贝。
<i>but I knew my mother would appreciate one.</i>

495
00:18:55,354 --> 00:18:57,387
Thank you, sweetie.

496
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:59,681
你没必要送我卡。
You didn't have to give me a card.

497
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,059
我知道你爱我。
I already know that you love me.

498
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:07,189
这个卓伊是什么东西？
Who the hell is Joy?

499
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,734
卓伊？
Joy, are you dating a black guy?

500
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:12,486
你和一个黑人约会了？？？

501
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,488
是的，但发生在五年后。
<i>CHRIS ROCK: She did, five years later.</i>

502
00:19:14,054 --> 00:19:16,987
* Everybody hates Chris! *
