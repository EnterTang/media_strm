(Tale of The Nine Tailed)

2
00:01:30,374 --> 00:01:33,145
I told you to sit tight, didn't I?

3
00:01:33,245 --> 00:01:35,614
And so we meet again. How long has it been exactly?

4
00:01:35,685 --> 00:01:38,255
I didn't have to torture the traitor to get my answers.

5
00:01:38,285 --> 00:01:41,785
I wanted him to tell you where and when to meet me.

6
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,724
I see the blade won't kill you.

7
00:01:50,535 --> 00:01:52,864
Back then, I wore the skin of a mortal.

8
00:01:53,965 --> 00:01:55,105
Not this time though.

9
00:02:10,055 --> 00:02:11,254
You have some cute tricks.

10
00:02:11,254 --> 00:02:13,525
I wanted a chance to measure our powers.

11
00:02:13,555 --> 00:02:14,654
Sounds good to me.

12
00:02:28,534 --> 00:02:29,605
Not bad.

13
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:32,335
You know nothing about me, Lee Yeon.

14
00:02:32,504 --> 00:02:34,904
I've lived far longer than you think I have.

15
00:02:35,745 --> 00:02:38,044
I existed long before you were born.

16
00:02:38,144 --> 00:02:39,814
The past is just a past.

17
00:02:39,814 --> 00:02:41,585
And I'll outlive you.

18
00:02:41,585 --> 00:02:43,615
Don't dream of an unrealistic future.

19
00:02:44,585 --> 00:02:46,454
In order to become a deity...

20
00:02:46,454 --> 00:02:49,085
and finally be free of this world's darkness,

21
00:02:49,654 --> 00:02:51,825
you endured 1,000 years beneath the black water.

22
00:02:51,825 --> 00:02:53,525
This world would've been mine...

23
00:02:53,865 --> 00:02:56,734
had I not been spotted by a human while ascending as a dragon.

24
00:02:58,894 --> 00:03:00,764
I feel bad for you. It's like...

25
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,465
getting kicked out of an exam...

26
00:03:02,465 --> 00:03:03,874
because you got caught with your phone.

27
00:03:04,034 --> 00:03:05,134
How sad.

28
00:03:05,675 --> 00:03:08,675
But that's how your fate has been designed, Imoogi.

29
00:03:08,775 --> 00:03:10,245
You really should get a proper name.

30
00:03:10,245 --> 00:03:12,844
You haven't changed at all. You're still very arrogant.

31
00:03:12,874 --> 00:03:14,784
You must think you have the world at your feet.

32
00:03:14,814 --> 00:03:17,284
I don't know about anything else, but I do think that way about you.

33
00:03:17,985 --> 00:03:19,154
You make me want to trample on you.

34
00:03:19,154 --> 00:03:21,324
Your brother, your woman,

35
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,694
and the life of her parents.

36
00:03:24,324 --> 00:03:25,594
I have control over them all.

37
00:03:26,564 --> 00:03:27,925
What do you have?

38
00:03:29,094 --> 00:03:30,795
Let me make a reasonable offer.

39
00:03:31,194 --> 00:03:35,004
Lee Yeon, if you give up your body, I will let everyone else live.

40
00:03:41,705 --> 00:03:43,944
What do I look like to you?

41
00:03:51,854 --> 00:03:53,425
Seogyeong Traitor.

42
00:03:58,124 --> 00:04:00,624
You're the one who took my parents!

43
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,215
This is the carnation I folded for them.

44
00:04:21,384 --> 00:04:22,645
Flip it over.

45
00:04:27,555 --> 00:04:29,124
(Ji A, why won't you save us?)

46
00:04:29,124 --> 00:04:32,194
Ji A, why won't you save us?

47
00:04:32,724 --> 00:04:34,064
Are they alive?

48
00:04:35,594 --> 00:04:37,965
- Where? - Bring me the mountain spirit,

49
00:04:38,295 --> 00:04:40,365
and I'll return your parents to you.

50
00:04:40,365 --> 00:04:42,735
- Tell me where they are! - You saw them,

51
00:04:42,965 --> 00:04:44,705
but failed to recognize them.

52
00:04:45,974 --> 00:04:47,275
What do you mean by that?

53
00:04:47,844 --> 00:04:49,374
You'll soon find out.

54
00:04:50,015 --> 00:04:51,645
I won't let you get away with this.

55
00:04:51,645 --> 00:04:53,814
Call the cops then or perhaps your boyfriend.

56
00:04:54,015 --> 00:04:55,145
Any option will do,

57
00:04:55,145 --> 00:04:57,215
but you won't ever see your parents again.

58
00:04:57,314 --> 00:04:59,715
Why? Why my parents?

59
00:04:59,715 --> 00:05:01,425
Because I knew this day would come.

60
00:05:01,685 --> 00:05:04,495
You would do anything to save your parents.

61
00:05:05,224 --> 00:05:07,025
Just like how you saved your father in your past life,

62
00:05:07,164 --> 00:05:10,095
I hope that you'll once again make a wise choice.

63
00:05:19,605 --> 00:05:21,305
You'll let everyone go if I give up my body?

64
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:25,245
Ji A, her parents, and even Rang?

65
00:05:25,714 --> 00:05:27,714
I'd like the entire package,

66
00:05:28,045 --> 00:05:30,915
but just the heart will also do.

67
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,425
Are you serious?

68
00:05:34,985 --> 00:05:36,324
I am.

69
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:40,024
So what will it be? Yes or no?

70
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:42,324
I...

71
00:05:45,834 --> 00:05:47,105
I...

72
00:05:57,845 --> 00:05:58,975
I don't want to.

73
00:06:00,084 --> 00:06:01,415
- Why not? - Because you seem like the type...

74
00:06:01,415 --> 00:06:03,045
to go back on a deal.

75
00:06:03,144 --> 00:06:04,855
I don't do business with those kinds.

76
00:06:05,415 --> 00:06:08,454
I'll personally free them all from your grip.

77
00:06:08,454 --> 00:06:09,685
Then enjoy...

78
00:06:10,324 --> 00:06:12,795
trampling on those you treasure.

79
00:06:13,865 --> 00:06:15,595
I know this isn't appropriate to ask,

80
00:06:16,225 --> 00:06:17,464
but why did you come back?

81
00:06:17,995 --> 00:06:19,064
As if anyone would welcome...

82
00:06:19,064 --> 00:06:20,935
the symbol of calamity, plague, and war.

83
00:06:20,935 --> 00:06:23,134
If you're asking me my view of the world, I don't have one.

84
00:06:23,504 --> 00:06:25,134
All I want is one thing.

85
00:06:26,435 --> 00:06:28,004
I want that woman.

86
00:06:29,644 --> 00:06:32,014
The woman who was supposed to be offered to me as a sacrifice...

87
00:06:32,675 --> 00:06:35,644
but ended up saving you and killing me.

88
00:06:37,884 --> 00:06:39,285
I like her.

89
00:06:39,915 --> 00:06:41,485
How dare you?

90
00:06:49,624 --> 00:06:52,564
That's enough. I just wanted to test your power.

91
00:06:52,665 --> 00:06:53,935
For me, this is just the beginning.

92
00:07:07,514 --> 00:07:10,314
"I want to die. Now."

93
00:07:54,495 --> 00:07:55,725
Do you feel it?

94
00:07:57,795 --> 00:07:59,964
I knew it. You're connected to him.

95
00:08:00,264 --> 00:08:02,805
- What? - You are his shell.

96
00:08:03,365 --> 00:08:05,134
Why are you doing this?

97
00:08:06,004 --> 00:08:07,605
You're also human.

98
00:08:07,605 --> 00:08:11,274
I'm human, so I don't want to die, and I have so many desires.

99
00:08:13,884 --> 00:08:17,155
Was committing treason not enough for you?

100
00:08:18,954 --> 00:08:20,925
All I did was dream of a new world...

101
00:08:20,925 --> 00:08:23,155
after having been born as a lowlife.

102
00:08:23,355 --> 00:08:24,954
My kids, wife, and mother.

103
00:08:25,095 --> 00:08:27,295
All I wanted to do was make sure they could eat proper food.

104
00:08:27,295 --> 00:08:29,095
But they called it treason and threatened to behead me.

105
00:08:29,665 --> 00:08:31,365
And that's when I met him.

106
00:08:31,894 --> 00:08:33,605
I'm sure it wasn't for free.

107
00:08:34,935 --> 00:08:37,204
What did you have to give in return for being able to stay alive?

108
00:08:39,235 --> 00:08:42,274
My kids, wife, and mother.

109
00:08:43,175 --> 00:08:46,845
I offered my family to Imoogi and was able live in return.

110
00:08:48,245 --> 00:08:49,545
You're crazy.

111
00:08:49,545 --> 00:08:52,384
You must lose something in order to gain something.

112
00:08:52,384 --> 00:08:55,084
So you want me to sell Yeon out?

113
00:08:55,824 --> 00:08:57,995
You want me to become someone like you?

114
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,925
The choice is yours, Ji A.

115
00:09:00,194 --> 00:09:02,495
Because of you, your parents were gone for half their lives.

116
00:09:02,495 --> 00:09:05,894
You can either see them at their funeral or...

117
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,105
One drop of this will be enough...

118
00:09:13,105 --> 00:09:15,245
to make him fall into a deep sleep.

119
00:09:17,545 --> 00:09:18,874
Put Yeon to sleep.

120
00:09:19,714 --> 00:09:22,915
Then you can get the life you've always dreamed of.

121
00:09:30,155 --> 00:09:34,494
(Chapter 11: Ground Cherries)

122
00:09:36,665 --> 00:09:40,135
I told you we should've gotten a massage chair.

123
00:09:40,135 --> 00:09:41,964
We'll only end up using it as a clothing rack.

124
00:09:41,964 --> 00:09:43,135
It's a waste of money.

125
00:09:43,135 --> 00:09:46,104
I'm old now, so my body isn't as healthy as...

126
00:09:46,104 --> 00:09:48,305
Will you put some strength into your hands?

127
00:09:50,074 --> 00:09:51,214
Got it.

128
00:09:53,444 --> 00:09:56,744
Bok Gil used to give great massages.

129
00:09:57,055 --> 00:10:00,584
He was also worried that you were always working day and night,

130
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,425
so he'd gather the bark of hardy rubber trees and Siberian ginseng...

131
00:10:03,425 --> 00:10:06,155
and boil them for your joints...

132
00:10:06,155 --> 00:10:08,795
I don't want to hear you talking about that unfilial son.

133
00:10:17,104 --> 00:10:19,974
Don't call my son unfilial.

134
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,444
Get out.

135
00:10:31,015 --> 00:10:34,625
Why do you keep acting like you're the only one...

136
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,994
who's heartbroken because of our son's death?

137
00:10:38,594 --> 00:10:39,954
I said get out!

138
00:10:40,155 --> 00:10:41,295
It was because of you.

139
00:10:41,795 --> 00:10:43,795
He wouldn't have committed suicide...

140
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:46,564
if you hadn't killed his wife.

141
00:10:49,905 --> 00:10:51,375
She was possessed with a ghost that causes plagues.

142
00:10:52,135 --> 00:10:53,645
I couldn't just sit back and watch the entire nation...

143
00:10:53,645 --> 00:10:55,145
suffer from a plague because of her.

144
00:10:55,505 --> 00:10:56,505
Exactly.

145
00:10:57,415 --> 00:10:58,875
That's who you are.

146
00:10:59,744 --> 00:11:02,944
You're neither Bok Gil's mother nor my wife.

147
00:11:03,785 --> 00:11:05,385
You're just the gatekeeper of the Samdo River.

148
00:11:06,015 --> 00:11:08,555
Meanwhile, I've been trying so hard...

149
00:11:09,655 --> 00:11:12,324
to understand you for so long, but I guess that was foolish of me.

150
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,765
I don't even want to look at you. Just leave!

151
00:11:23,104 --> 00:11:25,204
(132 people committed suicide in Geumran-gu.)

152
00:11:25,204 --> 00:11:27,305
(Grim Reapers are required to gather at the Temple of Death.)

153
00:11:33,844 --> 00:11:35,285
It's Imoogi, isn't it?

154
00:11:54,405 --> 00:11:56,974
You have two days to bring me Lee Yeon.

155
00:11:57,005 --> 00:11:58,935
It's his body I need.

156
00:11:58,935 --> 00:12:00,574
Rather than thinking about breaking the deal,

157
00:12:00,574 --> 00:12:02,305
think of a way to untangle the mess.

158
00:12:04,045 --> 00:12:05,444
Imoogi, that scumbag.

159
00:12:06,474 --> 00:12:08,314
What in the world has he done?

160
00:12:10,885 --> 00:12:12,954
("Unprecedented Mass Suicide, Citizens in Shock")

161
00:12:13,515 --> 00:12:15,724
Can you believe this?

162
00:12:15,824 --> 00:12:17,594
It's like a horror movie.

163
00:12:17,594 --> 00:12:18,755
How could 132 people in the same district...

164
00:12:18,755 --> 00:12:21,094
all commit suicide at the same time?

165
00:12:21,094 --> 00:12:22,364
Do you think they were some kind of a suicide group?

166
00:12:22,364 --> 00:12:24,564
There wasn't a single will found.

167
00:12:24,564 --> 00:12:27,204
People who commit suicide normally feel the urge...

168
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:30,604
to let people know why they chose to die.

169
00:12:30,604 --> 00:12:31,805
Or maybe it was a cult.

170
00:12:31,805 --> 00:12:34,045
In the 1970s, a group of cult believers in Jonestown...

171
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,305
committed mass suicide.

172
00:12:36,305 --> 00:12:37,744
They all drank poison,

173
00:12:37,744 --> 00:12:39,444
but this time, the causes of death are all different.

174
00:12:39,574 --> 00:12:41,185
This is so weird.

175
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:42,584
I'm back.

176
00:12:42,584 --> 00:12:44,155
Hey, Terry. You're back.

177
00:12:44,685 --> 00:12:48,425
Hey, wait. You were at Geumran-gu. Hey, are you...

178
00:12:49,025 --> 00:12:51,494
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

179
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,194
- Pardon? - Didn't you see the news?

180
00:12:53,395 --> 00:12:56,094
An hour ago, a group of people died there.

181
00:12:56,895 --> 00:12:58,564
- Really? - Where is Ji A?

182
00:12:58,895 --> 00:12:59,994
Didn't she come with you?

183
00:13:00,094 --> 00:13:02,035
She left early saying something urgent came up.

184
00:13:02,165 --> 00:13:03,834
- Isn't she at the office? - Really?

185
00:13:04,305 --> 00:13:05,474
I didn't see her come back.

186
00:13:05,905 --> 00:13:07,704
- Here's the footage I took. - Thank you.

187
00:13:09,145 --> 00:13:10,614
How was it today?

188
00:13:10,614 --> 00:13:12,744
Did Ji A give you a hard time?

189
00:13:12,744 --> 00:13:16,185
No, not at all. She's really kind.

190
00:13:20,555 --> 00:13:21,755
(Nam Ji A)

191
00:13:28,895 --> 00:13:31,035
(Nam Ji A)

192
00:13:46,175 --> 00:13:47,714
Bring me the mountain spirit,

193
00:13:48,145 --> 00:13:50,285
and I'll return your parents to you.

194
00:14:00,494 --> 00:14:02,494
(Lee Yeon)

195
00:14:06,494 --> 00:14:10,204
(Ji A, why won't you save us?)

196
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,175
Come in.

197
00:14:16,844 --> 00:14:17,944
My goodness.

198
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,114
This place is nice.

199
00:14:23,984 --> 00:14:26,915
The living room is spacious, but there aren't a lot of rooms.

200
00:14:31,094 --> 00:14:33,824
I guess vets make a lot of money.

201
00:14:34,925 --> 00:14:36,064
Come this way.

202
00:14:44,505 --> 00:14:45,635
Have a seat.

203
00:15:29,685 --> 00:15:30,755
This is...

204
00:15:30,785 --> 00:15:32,954
It's borscht, a traditional Russian dish.

205
00:15:34,255 --> 00:15:36,125
I know you probably didn't grow up eating this.

206
00:15:36,484 --> 00:15:38,125
But I thought you might miss the smell of where you're from.

207
00:15:46,535 --> 00:15:47,635
Don't you like it?

208
00:15:48,234 --> 00:15:51,805
I sometimes miss the forest where I was born and grew up in.

209
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:53,834
Right now, it's turned into an apartment complex.

210
00:16:04,155 --> 00:16:06,785
I know this smell. I also like it.

211
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:14,765
On top of that, it's delicious.

212
00:16:17,295 --> 00:16:18,364
Eat up.

213
00:16:28,474 --> 00:16:30,275
I'm sorry.

214
00:16:35,545 --> 00:16:36,584
Geomdoong?

215
00:16:36,714 --> 00:16:37,984
Mister.

216
00:16:39,285 --> 00:16:40,724
You brat. Get back here.

217
00:16:42,425 --> 00:16:45,025
Don't annoy me. I will kill you.

218
00:16:45,594 --> 00:16:46,755
Who's this?

219
00:16:47,155 --> 00:16:48,494
My stepdad.

220
00:16:49,265 --> 00:16:51,064
Come out. Get over here.

221
00:16:53,494 --> 00:16:54,704
You choose.

222
00:16:54,834 --> 00:16:56,364
You ask me for help,

223
00:16:56,464 --> 00:16:58,675
I'll make sure you never have to see him again.

224
00:16:59,405 --> 00:17:01,244
Or I'll just go my way.

225
00:17:02,405 --> 00:17:04,714
Hey you. Do you know him?

226
00:17:04,844 --> 00:17:06,875
Why are you butting into our family matter?

227
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,145
Quiet. I'm waiting to hear his response.

228
00:17:09,145 --> 00:17:11,584
What are you? Are you a cop?

229
00:17:14,584 --> 00:17:16,185
So...

230
00:17:17,155 --> 00:17:18,494
I...

231
00:17:18,795 --> 00:17:22,224
Soo Ho. Answer wisely. Got it?

232
00:17:27,805 --> 00:17:29,734
I have to go home.

233
00:17:30,935 --> 00:17:32,135
Okay.

234
00:17:50,354 --> 00:17:53,494
Yu Ri, who has no friends or family.

235
00:17:54,425 --> 00:17:56,964
- What? - I can't live without chicken,

236
00:17:58,264 --> 00:18:00,435
but if you want to eat Russian food at every meal,

237
00:18:00,835 --> 00:18:02,534
I'm willing to change my preferences.

238
00:18:04,034 --> 00:18:05,274
What are you talking about?

239
00:18:06,004 --> 00:18:09,075
I'm saying I want to become...

240
00:18:10,575 --> 00:18:13,075
your family and your friend.

241
00:18:16,544 --> 00:18:18,315
Family... Well,

242
00:18:19,855 --> 00:18:21,524
I have something similar to that.

243
00:18:21,585 --> 00:18:23,454
Your fake mom and dad that Lee Rang gave you?

244
00:18:23,784 --> 00:18:25,095
The department store owner?

245
00:18:25,425 --> 00:18:26,554
Yes.

246
00:18:27,224 --> 00:18:30,095
I'm their dead daughter's fill-in and just an empty shell,

247
00:18:30,994 --> 00:18:32,264
but they can't live without me.

248
00:18:32,264 --> 00:18:33,635
People say...

249
00:18:34,504 --> 00:18:38,075
they'd like to throw away their family if no one was watching.

250
00:18:38,474 --> 00:18:40,234
Because they make life hard on each other.

251
00:18:40,774 --> 00:18:44,115
But then again, you end up going back...

252
00:18:44,274 --> 00:18:45,345
and taking them back.

253
00:18:46,075 --> 00:18:47,444
Like Lee Yeon and Mr. Lee?

254
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:48,815
Right.

255
00:18:49,845 --> 00:18:51,284
So...

256
00:18:52,685 --> 00:18:55,524
Let the department owners have their lives back,

257
00:18:56,425 --> 00:18:58,954
and become a true family with me and...

258
00:18:59,194 --> 00:19:00,395
What are you guys doing here?

259
00:19:01,825 --> 00:19:03,724
- Mr. Lee! - Yeon?

260
00:19:03,925 --> 00:19:05,065
What are you doing here?

261
00:19:05,264 --> 00:19:06,435
I live here.

262
00:19:06,994 --> 00:19:09,034
Hey. Have you seen Ji A?

263
00:19:09,034 --> 00:19:10,804
She wasn't here. Why?

264
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,734
She isn't at the office either. Where is she?

265
00:19:14,544 --> 00:19:16,845
Anyway, keep doing whatever it was with the necklace thief.

266
00:19:19,615 --> 00:19:21,315
This is Yeon's house?

267
00:19:21,345 --> 00:19:24,185
It's okay. His house is my house.

268
00:19:25,315 --> 00:19:26,385
Did you just laugh?

269
00:19:26,655 --> 00:19:28,185
Sorry. Let's eat.

270
00:19:33,454 --> 00:19:34,665
Mr. Lee?

271
00:19:37,024 --> 00:19:38,135
What?

272
00:20:13,635 --> 00:20:15,734
What are you doing here?

273
00:20:17,405 --> 00:20:20,004
I felt like I could see you if I hung around here.

274
00:20:21,105 --> 00:20:24,974
You weren't answering your phone all day long. Did something happen?

275
00:20:27,175 --> 00:20:28,185
Yes.

276
00:20:29,444 --> 00:20:30,615
Me too.

277
00:20:31,214 --> 00:20:32,454
What happened?

278
00:20:33,754 --> 00:20:34,954
But first...

279
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,885
Ta-da.

280
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:41,925
Open it.

281
00:20:54,645 --> 00:20:57,204
Something that makes you happy just by thinking about it.

282
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:00,014
You remembered.

283
00:21:00,014 --> 00:21:01,044
Of course.

284
00:21:01,514 --> 00:21:03,885
The smell of freshly cooked rice, a complete set of world literature,

285
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:06,185
Dad's handmade gimbap, new sneakers,

286
00:21:06,554 --> 00:21:08,085
and me.

287
00:21:08,885 --> 00:21:10,155
Buy one, get one free.

288
00:21:14,865 --> 00:21:18,365
They say if you buy your girlfriend sneakers, she'll run away.

289
00:21:18,935 --> 00:21:21,964
Even if you run away, I want you to wear new sneakers...

290
00:21:22,605 --> 00:21:24,734
and only go on nice paths.

291
00:21:33,615 --> 00:21:35,214
Why are you smiling so sadly?

292
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,685
Do you not like them?

293
00:21:38,514 --> 00:21:39,685
I do.

294
00:21:40,754 --> 00:21:43,125
I never knew that the word "sneakers"...

295
00:21:43,524 --> 00:21:46,524
had such a sweet meaning.

296
00:21:52,665 --> 00:21:53,895
I like you.

297
00:21:56,004 --> 00:21:59,004
So much that I wouldn't regret exchanging my life for you.

298
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:09,014
Should we take a walk?

299
00:22:10,044 --> 00:22:11,254
On a nice path.

300
00:22:12,254 --> 00:22:13,284
Together.

301
00:22:22,565 --> 00:22:23,625
What's this?

302
00:22:24,294 --> 00:22:27,234
What else? A fresh human.

303
00:22:27,704 --> 00:22:28,835
Who is he?

304
00:22:28,905 --> 00:22:30,335
None of your concern.

305
00:22:30,734 --> 00:22:34,234
Turn him into a ground cherry for emergency food.

306
00:22:35,244 --> 00:22:36,405
Much obliged.

307
00:22:44,014 --> 00:22:46,754
He moved the ground cherry pot somewhere else?

308
00:22:48,224 --> 00:22:49,524
Do you want to watch?

309
00:22:51,794 --> 00:22:53,994
Are you allowed to show me?

310
00:22:53,994 --> 00:22:56,224
There's nothing to hide between us.

311
00:23:00,095 --> 00:23:01,635
It looks like an ordinary seed, doesn't it?

312
00:23:02,034 --> 00:23:03,865
It traps the body and soul,

313
00:23:03,865 --> 00:23:05,875
so I call it a latch for the body and soul.

314
00:23:06,004 --> 00:23:08,544
Only Imoogi can create it.

315
00:23:51,585 --> 00:23:53,085
What an evil soul.

316
00:23:53,284 --> 00:23:54,954
He was in and out of prison...

317
00:23:56,885 --> 00:23:58,524
Did you save a little kid?

318
00:24:00,754 --> 00:24:02,365
I need at least one good deed...

319
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:05,194
to defend myself with when I enter the Afterlife.

320
00:24:15,744 --> 00:24:17,444
- Do you want more milk? - Yes.

321
00:24:17,645 --> 00:24:18,714
Eat up.

322
00:24:18,714 --> 00:24:21,645
Stop eating already. That milk is mine.

323
00:24:22,845 --> 00:24:24,984
Why doesn't that lady go home?

324
00:24:24,984 --> 00:24:26,714
You go home.

325
00:24:26,915 --> 00:24:28,754
Or I'll eat your liver.

326
00:24:32,454 --> 00:24:34,524
I don't have a home anymore.

327
00:24:36,095 --> 00:24:37,665
Stop acting all pathetic.

328
00:24:37,734 --> 00:24:40,294
Thousands of people in Seoul don't have a home.

329
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,865
- Are you homeless too? - Not me.

330
00:24:43,704 --> 00:24:45,204
Stop fighting.

331
00:24:47,304 --> 00:24:49,675
Soo Ho, right? Where's your mom?

332
00:24:49,704 --> 00:24:52,145
My mom got beat up every single day...

333
00:24:52,145 --> 00:24:53,915
and ran away with some guy I don't know.

334
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:57,815
That's why my stepdad was so mad at me.

335
00:24:58,754 --> 00:25:00,385
So you must have nowhere to go.

336
00:25:00,385 --> 00:25:01,754
Oh, my gosh.

337
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,794
Mr. Lee, why are you doing this to me?

338
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:05,895
Eat up.

339
00:25:17,774 --> 00:25:19,004
What are you thinking about?

340
00:25:23,774 --> 00:25:26,315
You know the story "The Little Mermaid", right?

341
00:25:27,315 --> 00:25:28,385
Andersen?

342
00:25:28,815 --> 00:25:29,944
Yes.

343
00:25:30,744 --> 00:25:34,415
Ever since I was a child, I hated the ending.

344
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:38,024
She could've lived if she had killed the prince.

345
00:25:38,095 --> 00:25:40,554
So why did she turn into sea foam?

346
00:25:41,595 --> 00:25:44,835
What about you? What would you do if it were you?

347
00:25:45,135 --> 00:25:48,565
A long time ago, I thought I'd definitely kill the prince...

348
00:25:48,565 --> 00:25:50,464
and save myself.

349
00:25:50,565 --> 00:25:53,034
But? Have you changed your mind?

350
00:25:53,304 --> 00:25:55,105
Now that I've met the prince,

351
00:25:55,875 --> 00:25:59,244
I grew to like him much more than I imagined.

352
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:02,415
Although if the prince were gone,

353
00:26:03,115 --> 00:26:05,554
the fairy tale could end with a happy ending.

354
00:26:14,825 --> 00:26:16,595
If I were the little mermaid,

355
00:26:19,435 --> 00:26:21,165
I'd kill the sea witch.

356
00:26:21,964 --> 00:26:23,865
I'd rather not be her plaything.

357
00:26:31,714 --> 00:26:33,075
I've been cursed.

358
00:26:34,415 --> 00:26:37,744
I could have my parents back if I sell you out.

359
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:47,194
I've heard their wish,

360
00:26:48,825 --> 00:26:50,325
so tell me yours.

361
00:26:50,764 --> 00:26:52,395
I want my voice back...

362
00:26:52,964 --> 00:26:54,395
and find my prince.

363
00:26:54,665 --> 00:26:57,365
All while not turning into sea foam.

364
00:26:58,704 --> 00:27:00,375
So come witch-hunting with me.

365
00:27:01,345 --> 00:27:03,204
Are you sure you can spare such time?

366
00:27:04,244 --> 00:27:06,675
Our deal expires in 24 hours.

367
00:27:12,454 --> 00:27:14,784
It may very well be my last living day,

368
00:27:14,784 --> 00:27:17,625
so what's it to you whether or not...

369
00:27:17,754 --> 00:27:19,125
I let it go to waste?

370
00:27:19,254 --> 00:27:20,855
You'll just throw your life away?

371
00:27:21,365 --> 00:27:23,365
For the brother you loathe?

372
00:27:27,694 --> 00:27:29,565
Imoogi met with Lee Yeon today.

373
00:27:30,635 --> 00:27:32,875
He let your brother know of our three hostages.

374
00:27:33,405 --> 00:27:36,375
Ji A, her parents, and you.

375
00:27:38,444 --> 00:27:41,145
Where do you think he is right now?

376
00:27:45,655 --> 00:27:48,185
Has he even called you in concern?

377
00:27:51,024 --> 00:27:52,155
Liar.

378
00:27:53,494 --> 00:27:55,125
You've been abandoned once again.

379
00:27:56,794 --> 00:27:59,135
You're right. I did abandon you.

380
00:27:59,365 --> 00:28:00,494
I'm sorry...

381
00:28:00,635 --> 00:28:03,165
for saving you after your human mother abandoned you.

382
00:28:05,575 --> 00:28:06,734
Yeon...

383
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:10,704
I never abandoned you.

384
00:28:13,075 --> 00:28:15,214
He said he never once abandoned me.

385
00:28:19,385 --> 00:28:22,125
You of all people know that it's a lie.

386
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:27,754
- Hey, kid! - Yeon?

387
00:28:29,994 --> 00:28:31,835
He saved me from the Forest of the Starved.

388
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,694
He had to in order to save Ji A.

389
00:28:34,565 --> 00:28:36,264
You're nothing but disposable.

390
00:28:36,264 --> 00:28:37,504
Shut it!

391
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,875
Lee Yeon will do anything for Ji A...

392
00:28:41,004 --> 00:28:43,974
even if that involves killing you.

393
00:28:47,214 --> 00:28:48,615
If you go after her,

394
00:28:50,014 --> 00:28:51,915
I'll kill you for real this time.

395
00:28:54,954 --> 00:28:56,724
Will you give up your life...

396
00:28:57,185 --> 00:28:59,754
for a brother who only cares for his girl?

397
00:29:22,284 --> 00:29:23,444
Yes, Mr. Lee.

398
00:29:25,454 --> 00:29:28,024
What? Shin Ju?

399
00:29:30,554 --> 00:29:31,694
He wants to talk to you.

400
00:29:33,595 --> 00:29:34,794
This is Shin Ju.

401
00:29:34,895 --> 00:29:37,194
You know, right? Where's Yeon?

402
00:29:37,264 --> 00:29:38,964
He went to see Ms. Nam.

403
00:29:38,964 --> 00:29:40,264
So where?

404
00:29:40,595 --> 00:29:42,565
I'll call you back with an answer.

405
00:29:52,514 --> 00:29:53,845
It's 132 people.

406
00:29:53,845 --> 00:29:55,514
The number of dead people who aren't on the list is...

407
00:29:55,514 --> 00:29:57,244
There will be more.

408
00:29:58,315 --> 00:30:00,754
- What? - He is chaos itself.

409
00:30:01,085 --> 00:30:02,284
We're only getting started.

410
00:30:02,284 --> 00:30:05,024
Then let's bring him in. Tell me how, and I'll do it myself.

411
00:30:05,425 --> 00:30:06,724
It's beyond your capacity.

412
00:30:08,395 --> 00:30:09,794
In order to bring him in,

413
00:30:10,365 --> 00:30:13,365
you'll have to do what you hate with passion.

414
00:30:13,365 --> 00:30:14,534
And what may that be?

415
00:30:17,865 --> 00:30:20,034
Hey, Yeon. You're here.

416
00:30:27,815 --> 00:30:31,954
What? My gosh, you...

417
00:30:34,214 --> 00:30:35,724
Hello, sir and ma'am.

418
00:30:36,224 --> 00:30:37,554
I'm Nam Ji A.

419
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:57,140
Well, Yeon told us a lot about you.

420
00:30:57,239 --> 00:30:58,440
It's nice to meet you.

421
00:30:58,569 --> 00:30:59,809
You!

422
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:04,279
How dare you bring a living person here?

423
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,009
I know she's a living person,

424
00:31:06,009 --> 00:31:09,319
but she's also at the center of the argument you were having.

425
00:31:14,819 --> 00:31:18,489
You have stepped in here far too early. Go back.

426
00:31:18,489 --> 00:31:21,130
I'm well aware that you highly value rules and principles.

427
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:23,660
I came here knowing the risks because...

428
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,900
Do I look like your fairy godmother?

429
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,900
- What the... - Hold it.

430
00:31:30,069 --> 00:31:31,170
Or maybe...

431
00:31:32,009 --> 00:31:33,910
you'd like to know when you die.

432
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:36,410
No. I stay away from fortune tellers since I hate spoilers...

433
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:37,779
even about my own life.

434
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:40,880
- Then what? - I lost my parents at nine.

435
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,049
This isn't a place for your sob story.

436
00:31:43,049 --> 00:31:45,920
I hear that I possess something that belongs to Imoogi.

437
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,950
That's also the fate you were handed.

438
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:52,029
I plan to defy that fate until my last breath.

439
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,430
It is why I came here knowing that it wasn't a place...

440
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:59,700
for living people.

441
00:32:00,499 --> 00:32:03,700
- She's just like you. - Yes, we were made for each other.

442
00:32:05,569 --> 00:32:08,410
I admire you not being intimidated by me.

443
00:32:08,809 --> 00:32:10,009
So tell me why you're here.

444
00:32:12,309 --> 00:32:13,850
Let me borrow Clairvoyance.

445
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:15,979
I wish to know where my parents are.

446
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:19,420
- What? - It won't be for free.

447
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,519
As if you have anything to offer in return.

448
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,360
I'd let you overcharge me knowingly,

449
00:32:24,589 --> 00:32:26,660
but I don't have much to spare.

450
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:30,160
Then with what will you strike a deal?

451
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:32,200
We'll bring you Imoogi.

452
00:32:34,069 --> 00:32:35,970
Yeon and I.

453
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,890
Gosh, I made it out alive.

454
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,259
Didn't you see me trembling in there?

455
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,390
It hardly seemed like the case.

456
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:02,759
I thought that past lives and the Afterlife...

457
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:04,660
only existed in comic books,

458
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,069
but they're real.

459
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:08,970
Sinners only have better lives...

460
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:10,870
until they take their last breaths.

461
00:33:12,309 --> 00:33:15,239
Do you help the dead cross Samdo River from here?

462
00:33:15,809 --> 00:33:18,309
I give a presentation about what to expect in the Afterlife,

463
00:33:18,309 --> 00:33:20,850
catch those who refuse to cross the river,

464
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,150
and keep my wife happy.

465
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:26,049
I'm glad...

466
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:29,819
that someone as considerate as you is the first person...

467
00:33:29,819 --> 00:33:31,690
people meet after passing.

468
00:33:34,529 --> 00:33:36,700
You grew up well even though...

469
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,829
you lost your parents at a young age.

470
00:33:38,829 --> 00:33:41,130
They'll be incredibly proud of you.

471
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,900
Will I ever get to see them again?

472
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:49,880
Let's trust Yeon and believe that he'll deliver.

473
00:33:57,549 --> 00:33:58,819
This isn't like you, Granny.

474
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,620
Why do you say that?

475
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,890
Because you would've turned Imoogi into stone...

476
00:34:04,189 --> 00:34:06,890
way before he became a problem.

477
00:34:07,589 --> 00:34:09,500
I remember how you turned...

478
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,359
the northern mountain spirit into one...

479
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:12,700
just for getting on your wrong side.

480
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:13,899
So why...

481
00:34:16,299 --> 00:34:17,739
is Imoogi an exception?

482
00:34:17,899 --> 00:34:20,239
Because I don't want to see you go crazy.

483
00:34:23,009 --> 00:34:26,350
- What do you mean by that? - A piece of him lies with her.

484
00:34:26,509 --> 00:34:27,750
The Imoogi.

485
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,919
Is there a way...

486
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,959
to free her from it?

487
00:34:38,259 --> 00:34:39,359
No.

488
00:34:40,529 --> 00:34:41,959
Either she dies...

489
00:34:42,529 --> 00:34:44,730
or the Imoogi leaves her voluntarily.

490
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:47,629
I don't believe that. How can a piece of it be with her?

491
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,970
You must've heard something about it.

492
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:55,580
Despite your best efforts, Imoogi was awoken.

493
00:34:56,279 --> 00:34:58,480
The girl will be sacrificed,

494
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:03,180
and the rest of your life will be nothing but painful.

495
00:35:04,649 --> 00:35:05,750
That...

496
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,419
is your fate.

497
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:14,830
Now I get why you didn't want me to find her.

498
00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:20,669
From the start, you said we shouldn't meet.

499
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:23,140
You didn't want me to get hurt again.

500
00:35:24,993 --> 00:35:27,093
You didn't want me dragged into that fate again.

501
00:35:33,174 --> 00:35:35,104
Thanks, Granny.

502
00:35:36,774 --> 00:35:39,814
But still, I choose her.

503
00:35:41,343 --> 00:35:45,044
My only purpose in life was to meet her again.

504
00:35:47,413 --> 00:35:48,924
It looks like...

505
00:35:49,254 --> 00:35:51,424
you'll always end up making the same choice.

506
00:35:56,223 --> 00:35:57,424
The ground cherries.

507
00:36:03,064 --> 00:36:04,763
That's where her parents are.

508
00:36:14,843 --> 00:36:15,944
Let's go.

509
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:17,814
- We'll be off now. - Oh, okay.

510
00:36:18,683 --> 00:36:20,254
If anything happens,

511
00:36:20,254 --> 00:36:23,053
come here and repeat my name three times.

512
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:24,584
I don't know if you'll win or lose the fight against fate,

513
00:36:25,294 --> 00:36:27,093
but I still want to bet on you guys.

514
00:36:27,854 --> 00:36:28,924
Thank you.

515
00:36:30,863 --> 00:36:31,894
You should go now.

516
00:36:42,343 --> 00:36:43,444
Did you find out?

517
00:36:43,843 --> 00:36:44,973
The ground cherries.

518
00:36:45,044 --> 00:36:46,214
"Ground cherries"?

519
00:36:47,444 --> 00:36:49,714
I've never seen ground cherries in Seoul before.

520
00:36:49,743 --> 00:36:51,044
Are these ground cherries?

521
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:53,053
That's where my mom and dad are?

522
00:36:54,453 --> 00:36:55,524
How?

523
00:36:55,584 --> 00:36:58,124
That plant can trap the body and soul of a living person.

524
00:36:58,323 --> 00:37:00,723
And he used that to lengthen the lives of his followers.

525
00:37:01,493 --> 00:37:03,823
Let's go. It was in the living room.

526
00:37:03,823 --> 00:37:05,093
It was in the center of the living room.

527
00:37:05,093 --> 00:37:06,433
He probably moved it somewhere else.

528
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:07,763
It wasn't there when I last went.

529
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,710
Our deal expires in 24 hours.

530
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,239
You drove a wedge between the two brothers.

531
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:01,409
Do you think Rang will fall for it?

532
00:38:01,409 --> 00:38:02,509
Yes, he will.

533
00:38:02,779 --> 00:38:05,610
Rang has a deep-rooted obsession for his brother.

534
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,810
It's a lot more twisted than you think.

535
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:10,850
You think he can kill him because he loves him?

536
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,690
Leave this to me.

537
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:15,089
I'll bring you Yeon's heart.

538
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,520
Don't look down on him.

539
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:19,230
The reason I got defeated by him long ago...

540
00:38:19,489 --> 00:38:21,190
was because I underestimated him.

541
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:23,730
That's why I set up three traps.

542
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:25,400
We just need one of them to fall for it.

543
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,569
Once this is over, I'll go into politics.

544
00:38:29,739 --> 00:38:32,009
I'm sick of pretending to be the CEO of a broadcasting company.

545
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,710
- And I deserve a reward. - Whatever you want.

546
00:38:37,739 --> 00:38:39,150
You little monster.

547
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,690
Where do you think he is right now?

548
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,560
Has he even called you in concern?

549
00:38:49,219 --> 00:38:50,460
You've been abandoned once again.

550
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,159
Will you give up your life...

551
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:54,929
for a brother who only cares for his girl?

552
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,440
- Yeon. - Were there ground cherries...

553
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,710
at Imoogi's house?

554
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:09,739
Ji A's parents are trapped inside there.

555
00:39:09,739 --> 00:39:11,009
Do you know anything about that?

556
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:16,150
Is that all you have to say to me?

557
00:39:17,049 --> 00:39:18,420
Did you see the cherries or not?

558
00:39:19,589 --> 00:39:20,719
I did.

559
00:39:21,619 --> 00:39:22,860
Where did he hide the cherries?

560
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,719
I don't know that much.

561
00:39:25,659 --> 00:39:27,529
- Bye. - I can find out.

562
00:39:28,029 --> 00:39:30,159
The CEO values it as much as his own life.

563
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,900
- Really? - Let's meet tomorrow.

564
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,469
Let's talk about it then.

565
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:56,619
Rang told me he'll look into it. I'm going to meet him tomorrow.

566
00:39:56,819 --> 00:39:59,089
Where? What time? Should I go with you?

567
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:02,500
Leave it to me.

568
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,600
I need you to do the thing that only you can do.

569
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:11,639
What are you guys doing here?

570
00:40:11,699 --> 00:40:13,170
We got too worried about her...

571
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:14,869
after knowing her boyfriend is a nine-tailed fox.

572
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,009
- Ji A. - What?

573
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:18,810
How did you know where I live?

574
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:21,179
Director Nam once did a background check on you.

575
00:40:21,279 --> 00:40:22,819
Why did you come all the way here?

576
00:40:22,819 --> 00:40:25,049
We came to see if you're safe.

577
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:28,020
I won't ever approve of a nine-tailed fox...

578
00:40:29,589 --> 00:40:31,790
Actually, I take that back. How big is this living room?

579
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:38,500
I didn't think it was right to visit empty-handedly.

580
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:40,569
- What is it? - It's just a snack.

581
00:40:42,569 --> 00:40:43,600
Mealworms?

582
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,469
I asked a friend who directs an animal show,

583
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,009
and he told me foxes love it.

584
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:50,210
I had trouble choosing between mealworms and crickets.

585
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:51,480
You can go ahead and enjoy it.

586
00:40:54,509 --> 00:40:56,080
Did you guys eat dinner?

587
00:40:56,449 --> 00:40:58,119
- No. - I'll order.

588
00:41:41,989 --> 00:41:46,299
Only the fox's death can break a deal made by a fox.

589
00:41:54,509 --> 00:41:56,540
(Goboon's Tripe Restaurant)

590
00:42:00,909 --> 00:42:02,219
They wrap it in a bundle?

591
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:04,080
Let me eat with them first.

592
00:42:11,819 --> 00:42:15,029
The CEO was the accomplice of the mummy case?

593
00:42:15,029 --> 00:42:18,360
I asked him about the nail I found, and he admitted everything.

594
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,600
Why don't you call the cops?

595
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:20,830
And say what?

596
00:42:21,029 --> 00:42:24,440
That our CEO is from Goryeo?

597
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,509
And that he's a follower of Imoogi and goes around killing people?

598
00:42:27,509 --> 00:42:28,810
You think they'll believe that?

599
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:30,110
You're right.

600
00:42:30,179 --> 00:42:32,210
Then why not let Detective Baek put on those glasses...

601
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:33,980
that show you people's past lives?

602
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:35,779
Once he sees people's past lives,

603
00:42:35,779 --> 00:42:37,279
he might believe that there's a guy from Goryeo.

604
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,449
Are you sure he graduated from the best university in Korea?

605
00:42:41,949 --> 00:42:43,060
He's a nice guy.

606
00:42:43,989 --> 00:42:45,560
Why aren't you eating anything?

607
00:42:45,889 --> 00:42:47,929
You didn't eat the mealworms, and you're not eating any tripe.

608
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,230
Do you eat people's livers?

609
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,529
You're making me crave it a little.

610
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:03,279
It's pretty good.

611
00:43:04,509 --> 00:43:06,480
I know this is rude, but do you have a tail?

612
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,750
Why would you ask if you know it's rude?

613
00:43:07,779 --> 00:43:10,350
I still can't believe that you're a nine-tailed fox.

614
00:43:10,449 --> 00:43:11,980
Yes, he has one. I saw it.

615
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:13,790
Unbelievable. Then do you also put a leaf on your forehead...

616
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:15,290
and transform yourself?

617
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:16,460
That's a raccoon.

618
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,889
And I do know how to transform, but I don't because it's not classy.

619
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:21,460
Show us! Show us!

620
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:22,799
You punk.

621
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:26,600
- My gosh, just eat. - Just eat the food.

622
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:44,779
I'll do it.

623
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:50,560
What made you change your mind?

624
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,830
I want to live.

625
00:43:55,759 --> 00:43:58,799
Do you really think you can take out your brother's heart?

626
00:43:59,299 --> 00:44:02,000
You can take out his heart.

627
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:04,600
I'll lure him to you.

628
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,540
You have such a tender heart.

629
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,009
Take this.

630
00:44:15,179 --> 00:44:17,880
And lure Yeon to the location I tell you to.

631
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:21,049
From now on, we'll be moving together.

632
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:23,819
You can sleep here tonight.

633
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,799
He's so fit to work at a broadcasting company.

634
00:45:12,469 --> 00:45:14,469
- You should keep working here. - You're too kind.

635
00:45:14,839 --> 00:45:16,380
Did you buy everything this morning?

636
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,380
Yes.

637
00:45:17,739 --> 00:45:20,009
- Eat up. - It looks good. Let's eat.

638
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:21,880
When did you get so close?

639
00:45:21,949 --> 00:45:24,319
Hey. He's a real piece of work.

640
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,549
He knows history, literature, arts, religion, everything.

641
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:28,920
He's a walking encyclopedia.

642
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,460
He was useful on the field too.

643
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:33,089
Remember the foreign language papers on past lives?

644
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:35,759
He translated the English, French, and Chinese papers...

645
00:45:35,759 --> 00:45:36,900
all last night.

646
00:45:38,167 --> 00:45:39,297
What's your secret?

647
00:45:39,297 --> 00:45:42,197
I never left home when I was young because of my health.

648
00:45:42,366 --> 00:45:44,936
I was alone other than for my babysitter.

649
00:45:45,536 --> 00:45:46,976
So all I did was read.

650
00:45:58,047 --> 00:46:00,556
Good morning. So this was where you all were.

651
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:02,927
Nice. Who picked up sandwiches?

652
00:46:03,056 --> 00:46:06,427
- It's mine. - Just one. Don't be cheap.

653
00:46:09,427 --> 00:46:11,697
Urban Legends team, we have a team dinner tonight.

654
00:46:11,697 --> 00:46:13,337
- I'm out. - Me too.

655
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:15,667
No, no, no. No investigations, no editing,

656
00:46:15,667 --> 00:46:18,036
no excuses will work today. Why not?

657
00:46:18,337 --> 00:46:19,877
Because it's Terry's welcome dinner.

658
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:39,726
Hey.

659
00:46:42,326 --> 00:46:43,596
What are you doing here?

660
00:46:46,237 --> 00:46:47,337
Making coffee.

661
00:46:48,337 --> 00:46:50,467
What's with these flowers that don't suit you at all?

662
00:46:51,436 --> 00:46:53,237
So that you can enjoy the scent of our old home.

663
00:46:53,576 --> 00:46:56,476
Pick one that you like. Women love this stuff.

664
00:46:57,846 --> 00:46:59,417
That was thoughtful of you.

665
00:47:43,056 --> 00:47:45,226
So? Where are the ground cherries? Did you find out?

666
00:47:45,226 --> 00:47:46,456
What's the rush?

667
00:47:46,456 --> 00:47:47,927
I don't have time to chit chat.

668
00:47:50,427 --> 00:47:52,697
- What? - I don't have time either.

669
00:47:53,436 --> 00:47:56,107
But still, listen to what I have to say.

670
00:47:58,737 --> 00:47:59,906
What is it?

671
00:48:04,277 --> 00:48:05,507
What am I to you?

672
00:48:09,547 --> 00:48:11,386
Where did things get twisted again?

673
00:48:12,487 --> 00:48:14,056
I've done all I could.

674
00:48:14,257 --> 00:48:15,886
What's the problem this time?

675
00:48:16,087 --> 00:48:17,186
Answer me.

676
00:48:18,587 --> 00:48:20,226
What am I to you?

677
00:48:23,226 --> 00:48:24,366
You're family.

678
00:48:25,427 --> 00:48:27,797
Sickening family that thinks just because we had the same dad,

679
00:48:27,797 --> 00:48:31,366
you had the right to do all sorts of wicked things to me.

680
00:48:32,936 --> 00:48:35,976
Don't think I'll feed you flowery words...

681
00:48:35,976 --> 00:48:38,447
just because you surrounded me with flowers.

682
00:48:39,277 --> 00:48:42,116
I'm sick of your whining at your age!

683
00:48:45,386 --> 00:48:47,357
You're so mean to me...

684
00:48:48,217 --> 00:48:51,257
when you're endlessly magnanimous to her.

685
00:48:51,257 --> 00:48:53,897
Yes. Because she's much tougher than you.

686
00:48:54,357 --> 00:48:56,967
She doesn't cling onto her family tragedy like a loser...

687
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:58,627
and whine like somebody.

688
00:49:00,397 --> 00:49:01,567
Isn't it odd?

689
00:49:03,436 --> 00:49:05,976
You were never once a nice brother,

690
00:49:08,076 --> 00:49:10,147
but shone in my eyes as if you were.

691
00:49:12,076 --> 00:49:13,447
You seemed perfect.

692
00:49:14,746 --> 00:49:15,877
I wanted...

693
00:49:17,647 --> 00:49:18,846
to become like you.

694
00:49:26,656 --> 00:49:27,757
Drink it.

695
00:49:28,897 --> 00:49:30,826
What if you spiked it?

696
00:49:34,837 --> 00:49:36,967
Calm down. I'm just kidding.

697
00:50:00,127 --> 00:50:02,766
So? Where are the ground cherries?

698
00:50:03,067 --> 00:50:04,967
Wait. We'll find them soon.

699
00:50:05,197 --> 00:50:08,536
Don't you dare try anything funny.

700
00:50:08,697 --> 00:50:10,806
After you saved me from the Forest of the Starved,

701
00:50:11,567 --> 00:50:12,877
I thought...

702
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:20,047
I should die for you someday...

703
00:50:20,877 --> 00:50:22,346
in order to save you.

704
00:50:24,447 --> 00:50:28,286
But you know, I realized I couldn't.

705
00:50:28,987 --> 00:50:30,127
I want to live.

706
00:50:32,627 --> 00:50:33,897
That's why...

707
00:50:35,726 --> 00:50:38,027
I need you to die, big brother.

708
00:50:51,777 --> 00:50:52,947
Do you want to fight?

709
00:50:53,947 --> 00:50:56,746
I can't beat you if we fight fair and square.

710
00:51:01,417 --> 00:51:02,556
The coffee.

711
00:51:15,936 --> 00:51:19,406
If you cared for me even a fraction of how much you worry about her,

712
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,536
I wouldn't have done this.

713
00:51:23,877 --> 00:51:25,246
I could never.

714
00:51:30,717 --> 00:51:32,147
You idiot.

715
00:52:27,746 --> 00:52:29,047
We got Lee Yeon.

716
00:52:32,516 --> 00:52:34,087
Wait until I get there.

717
00:52:34,116 --> 00:52:35,616
Don't call me on this phone again.

718
00:52:43,266 --> 00:52:45,766
Darn it. Does he think I'm his lackey or something?

719
00:52:57,047 --> 00:52:59,516
Hey. Here. Come here.

720
00:52:59,817 --> 00:53:02,476
Sit down. Sit. Okay.

721
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:05,616
Okay, then. Fill your glasses everyone.

722
00:53:05,786 --> 00:53:07,556
I'll fill yours, Terry.

723
00:53:07,556 --> 00:53:10,157
Okay. Here you go.

724
00:53:10,157 --> 00:53:12,286
- Thank you. - I'll pour my own.

725
00:53:14,226 --> 00:53:16,366
- Welcome. - Welcome.

726
00:53:16,366 --> 00:53:18,297
- Thank you. - Drink up.

727
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:23,907
Gosh. I wish I had a son like him.

728
00:53:24,636 --> 00:53:28,177
He's handsome, smart... He's so...

729
00:53:28,277 --> 00:53:30,576
My gosh. He's so fit. He's solid.

730
00:53:32,476 --> 00:53:35,416
He's totally... Sure. You're a good kid.

731
00:53:35,416 --> 00:53:38,246
I'm starting to respect Mr. Choi now.

732
00:53:38,346 --> 00:53:40,616
How is he so unchanging?

733
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:50,297
I'm going to get some air.

734
00:53:54,636 --> 00:53:55,866
Terry, where are you going?

735
00:54:04,377 --> 00:54:05,976
I need to meet someone for a bit.

736
00:54:06,047 --> 00:54:07,277
I'll be right back.

737
00:54:07,346 --> 00:54:09,246
Where did you learn such manners?

738
00:54:10,217 --> 00:54:11,746
- Sorry? - Who leaves a dinner...

739
00:54:11,746 --> 00:54:12,987
without saying anything?

740
00:54:13,087 --> 00:54:14,317
Especially the guest of honor.

741
00:54:16,657 --> 00:54:19,726
- I'm sorry. - I have a lot of questions for you.

742
00:54:21,797 --> 00:54:22,996
Like what, for instance?

743
00:54:26,197 --> 00:54:27,666
What's your favorite book?

744
00:54:28,697 --> 00:54:30,666
- "A Lover's Discourse: Fragments". - By Roland Barthes?

745
00:54:30,706 --> 00:54:31,806
Have you read it?

746
00:54:31,837 --> 00:54:33,237
I got baited by the title.

747
00:54:33,706 --> 00:54:35,607
I thought it'd teach me about love,

748
00:54:35,777 --> 00:54:38,206
but to understand his language of love,

749
00:54:38,306 --> 00:54:41,016
one needs at least a master's degree.

750
00:54:42,016 --> 00:54:43,587
He wrote many beautiful phrases.

751
00:54:44,147 --> 00:54:47,217
"He praises her perfection..."

752
00:54:48,056 --> 00:54:50,386
"and praises himself..."

753
00:54:50,686 --> 00:54:52,357
"for choosing pure perfection."

754
00:54:54,956 --> 00:54:57,166
Meanwhile, I praise cocktails.

755
00:54:57,797 --> 00:54:58,967
Come on.

756
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:15,777
I have five minutes left. End our deal.

757
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:20,757
Our deal ends when I have Lee Yeon's heart.

758
00:55:21,657 --> 00:55:23,487
I brought him to you as promised.

759
00:55:24,127 --> 00:55:26,357
Now announce the end of our deal.

760
00:55:26,357 --> 00:55:28,757
Can't you see I'm waiting for Imoogi?

761
00:55:29,257 --> 00:55:30,326
Being rude, are we?

762
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:31,797
I bet it drives you crazy.

763
00:55:32,967 --> 00:55:35,436
You can't kill the one who you owe a favor.

764
00:55:41,806 --> 00:55:43,447
Once a slave, always a slave.

765
00:55:44,147 --> 00:55:46,206
You can't do anything without your master's approval.

766
00:55:46,547 --> 00:55:47,746
Watch what you say.

767
00:55:48,047 --> 00:55:50,846
You're still bound to me by the favor you owe.

768
00:55:50,846 --> 00:55:53,916
You serve a creature that sucked the blood of your family.

769
00:55:55,016 --> 00:55:56,116
Shut it.

770
00:55:56,116 --> 00:55:57,186
How did it feel...

771
00:55:57,487 --> 00:55:59,857
to watch your parents, wife, and children die?

772
00:56:00,527 --> 00:56:01,596
Did you cry?

773
00:56:01,657 --> 00:56:04,096
- I told you to shut it. - Then say it!

774
00:56:04,567 --> 00:56:06,226
Say that our deal is over.

775
00:56:06,536 --> 00:56:09,036
Fine. I'll end our deal...

776
00:56:10,306 --> 00:56:11,567
in my own way.

777
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:25,246
You've lost your mind.

778
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:28,556
No can do, I'm afraid.

779
00:56:28,817 --> 00:56:31,527
I may be a worthless piece of trash,

780
00:56:32,226 --> 00:56:35,257
but I can't sacrifice my family to get what I want.

781
00:56:35,996 --> 00:56:39,127
You... Then you'll die.

782
00:56:40,297 --> 00:56:41,397
I won't.

783
00:56:41,397 --> 00:56:43,706
Foxes die when they go back on a deal.

784
00:56:45,007 --> 00:56:46,366
And foxes...

785
00:56:47,907 --> 00:56:49,436
can change their appearances.

786
00:56:50,147 --> 00:56:52,746
Although, I find it distasteful.

787
00:56:59,116 --> 00:57:01,386
You and your desire to seem graceful.

788
00:57:01,686 --> 00:57:04,157
I thought you said you'd only take a sip?

789
00:57:05,956 --> 00:57:07,157
What's going on?

790
00:57:07,197 --> 00:57:08,357
Since when...

791
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:12,826
Since your place last night.

792
00:57:24,007 --> 00:57:25,206
What are you...

793
00:57:26,547 --> 00:57:27,647
doing here?

794
00:57:34,616 --> 00:57:35,757
I'm sorry.

795
00:57:37,157 --> 00:57:39,056
I only thought you were one of the hostages.

796
00:57:40,726 --> 00:57:42,397
I didn't think he'd kill everyone.

797
00:57:51,407 --> 00:57:53,806
So how about you keep living by my side?

798
00:57:59,147 --> 00:58:00,447
No matter what I do,

799
00:58:01,777 --> 00:58:03,487
I can't be free of my deal.

800
00:58:03,786 --> 00:58:05,147
There's a way.

801
00:58:07,157 --> 00:58:08,257
How?

802
00:58:09,717 --> 00:58:11,456
Swap places with me...

803
00:58:12,686 --> 00:58:16,197
and bring me to him just like he wants.

804
00:58:18,166 --> 00:58:19,266
I'll do it.

805
00:58:20,266 --> 00:58:21,397
Take this.

806
00:58:22,536 --> 00:58:24,166
You can sleep here tonight.

807
00:58:43,627 --> 00:58:47,056
Darn you. How dare you!

808
00:58:57,607 --> 00:59:00,136
You. Kill Lee Yeon right now...

809
00:59:01,907 --> 00:59:03,476
Stop harassing my brother...

810
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:05,846
or I'll have to snap your neck.

811
00:59:07,677 --> 00:59:10,147
So, the choice is yours.

812
00:59:10,817 --> 00:59:13,916
Kill Rang and have your life ended by me. Or...

813
00:59:15,587 --> 00:59:16,786
change his deal.

814
00:59:23,366 --> 00:59:26,067
Save me and our deal will be over.

815
00:59:47,357 --> 00:59:49,857
The ground cherries... Take me to where they are.

816
01:00:15,916 --> 01:00:17,886
- Here. - We drink to get drunk.

817
01:00:17,886 --> 01:00:19,886
- Darn it. - But you're wasted, sir.

818
01:00:19,886 --> 01:00:21,456
- But... - Please drive safely. Bye!

819
01:00:21,456 --> 01:00:23,087
I'll get going then!

820
01:00:26,427 --> 01:00:28,556
Take my car instead. I called for a designated driver.

821
01:00:29,967 --> 01:00:32,226
- It's fine. - But I'm not.

822
01:00:37,837 --> 01:00:39,607
Sorry about that. You can get going.

823
01:00:54,257 --> 01:00:55,357
Ms. Nam.

824
01:00:56,386 --> 01:00:58,587
- Yes? - Are you seeing someone?

825
01:00:59,456 --> 01:01:01,157
Yes, I am.

826
01:01:01,496 --> 01:01:03,157
What's your boyfriend like?

827
01:01:05,226 --> 01:01:06,797
Like someone from a fairy tale.

828
01:01:07,897 --> 01:01:08,967
Break up with him.

829
01:01:10,766 --> 01:01:13,067
- What? - Fairy tales for grown-ups...

830
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:16,507
tend to have savage endings.

831
01:01:28,357 --> 01:01:30,157
So long. Thank you for everything.

832
01:01:33,027 --> 01:01:34,527
What a blabbermouth.

833
01:01:44,837 --> 01:01:46,007
I no longer am bound.

834
01:01:52,007 --> 01:01:53,306
Nice acting, by the way.

835
01:01:53,817 --> 01:01:55,116
You were good enough to be an actor.

836
01:01:55,717 --> 01:01:56,817
Maybe I'll give it a shot.

837
01:02:23,036 --> 01:02:24,107
Terry.

838
01:02:25,846 --> 01:02:28,377
Don't pretend with the romantic feelings.

839
01:02:29,947 --> 01:02:31,346
Because to me,

840
01:02:37,226 --> 01:02:38,826
you're nothing...

841
01:02:39,456 --> 01:02:41,627
but the thing that took my parents from me.

842
01:02:43,357 --> 01:02:44,826
I see you've known all along.

843
01:02:50,366 --> 01:02:52,306
Is that why you've been keeping me here?

844
01:02:54,107 --> 01:02:56,377
I need you to do the thing that only you can do.

845
01:02:57,346 --> 01:02:58,777
What only I can do?

846
01:03:00,007 --> 01:03:01,576
While I search for the ground cherries,

847
01:03:01,576 --> 01:03:03,246
keep Imoogi occupied.

848
01:03:03,717 --> 01:03:04,886
Imoogi?

849
01:03:06,246 --> 01:03:07,416
Where is he?

850
01:03:07,786 --> 01:03:08,786
Someplace...

851
01:03:09,087 --> 01:03:11,357
much closer to you than you think.

852
01:03:12,826 --> 01:03:14,226
Much closer to me?

853
01:03:17,067 --> 01:03:18,366
No way...

854
01:03:24,636 --> 01:03:26,136
You seem unprotected...

855
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:27,677
for someone who knows my true identity.

856
01:03:30,036 --> 01:03:31,677
Yeon told me...

857
01:03:32,507 --> 01:03:34,516
that you can't kill me.

858
01:03:37,346 --> 01:03:38,547
He's right.

859
01:03:43,686 --> 01:03:45,556
I'm quite fond of you.

860
01:05:36,136 --> 01:05:37,266
Mom.

861
01:05:41,136 --> 01:05:42,277
Dad.

862
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:30,016
(Tale of The Nine Tailed)

863
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:31,987
You probably wanted to warn me.

864
01:06:32,627 --> 01:06:34,527
I'll save your life no matter what.

865
01:06:34,527 --> 01:06:36,527
You're going to attack Imoogi directly?

866
01:06:36,527 --> 01:06:38,226
I'm going to find his weakness.

867
01:06:38,627 --> 01:06:40,837
I'll kill those who are precious to you.

868
01:06:40,837 --> 01:06:42,436
A bigger disaster is on its way.

869
01:06:42,897 --> 01:06:44,337
Don't touch them.

870
01:06:44,337 --> 01:06:46,866
Look carefully. I am you.

871
01:06:47,136 --> 01:06:49,007
Where is Ji A? Where is she?

872
01:06:49,237 --> 01:06:50,907
A plague will hit this world.

873
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,277
No one will be happy.

874
01:06:53,277 --> 01:06:54,677
Why does it have to be Ji A? Why?

875
01:06:54,846 --> 01:06:57,317
Turn everything back to where it belongs.
