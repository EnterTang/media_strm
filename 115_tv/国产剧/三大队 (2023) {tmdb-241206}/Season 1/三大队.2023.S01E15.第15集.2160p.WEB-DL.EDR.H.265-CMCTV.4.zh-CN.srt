1
00:00:13,118 --> 00:00:14,288
怎么了
What?

2
00:00:14,288 --> 00:00:16,548
咱们这是日行一善 好不好
It's our good deed for the day, all right?

3
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:19,308
省省吧 兄弟 我来搞定
Slow your roll, bro. I got it.

4
00:00:20,928 --> 00:00:22,458
- 到了  - 谢谢你
- All right.  - Thank you.

5
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:23,248
不客气
You're welcome.

6
00:00:23,268 --> 00:00:25,148
我发誓 在刚才问路的时候
I swear, when I asked for directions,

7
00:00:25,148 --> 00:00:26,928
绝没料到会载我一程
I never expected a ride.

8
00:00:26,928 --> 00:00:28,468
或者说 是一趟观光游
Or a guided tour, I bet.

9
00:00:28,468 --> 00:00:30,068
这是我们的荣幸 真的
Well, it was our pleasure. It really was.

10
00:00:30,068 --> 00:00:33,068
希望你在随后的纽约之行开心
I hope you enjoy the rest of your stay in New York.

11
00:00:33,068 --> 00:00:35,268
那么 如果你还需要其他
Now, if you need anything--

12
00:00:35,278 --> 00:00:37,238
任何帮助 给我打电话就行 知道吗
That's anything-- just call me, okay?

13
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:39,438
人们都说纽约人特别粗鲁
And they say New Yorkers are so rude.

14
00:00:39,448 --> 00:00:40,858
真是胡说八道 你们俩太赞了
- Crazy. - You guys are awesome.

15
00:00:40,858 --> 00:00:42,308
谢谢啦 拜拜
Thank you. Bye.

16
00:00:42,318 --> 00:00:44,318
再见
Bye.

17
00:00:44,318 --> 00:00:46,148
喔
Ooh.

18
00:00:46,148 --> 00:00:48,448
贴心警官 准备好重返工作岗位了吗
Officer Sweetie Pie, are you ready to get back to work?

19
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,758
还没 我快饿死了
No. I'm starving.

20
00:00:50,758 --> 00:00:52,988
就在街那边 有家特棒的日本料理店
There's this great Japanese fusion place right up the street.

21
00:00:52,988 --> 00:00:54,368
咱俩一起去那儿吃午饭吧  
Put us out for lunch.

22
00:00:54,368 --> 00:00:55,928
你刚把咱们整个午饭时间用光了
You just used up our entire meal period.

23
00:00:55,928 --> 00:00:59,098
1C线广播 一则报案称
One Charles on the air, be advised you have a 911 call

24
00:00:59,098 --> 00:01:01,428
有人持枪出现在华盛顿广场公园
Of a man with a gun in Washington Square Park.

25
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:03,678
男子 白人 三十多岁 身着灰色西装和领带 深色头发
Male white, 30s, wearing a gray suit and tie dark hair.

26
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,518
开工
Let's do it.

27
00:01:05,518 --> 00:01:07,098
我真的快饿死了
I'm really starving.

28
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,608
这叫报应 兄弟
That's karma, bro.

29
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:12,478
我要饿扁了
I'm really hungry.

30
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:23,015
我不知道哪儿才算中间立场 议员先生
I'm not sure where that middle ground would be, Councilman.

31
00:01:23,015 --> 00:01:25,735
在你看来一天工作12小时才能不断创造财富
You see a 12-hour workday creating economies;

32
00:01:25,735 --> 00:01:30,205
而我看到的是三万四千名警员因疲惫无法全心工作
I see 34,000 tired cops unable to perform at their optimum.

33
00:01:32,075 --> 00:01:34,425
彼此彼此
Likewise.

34
00:01:34,425 --> 00:01:36,075
抱歉
Sorry.

35
00:01:36,085 --> 00:01:38,585
我才该道歉 我知道你很忙
No, I'm sorry; I know you're busy.

36
00:01:38,585 --> 00:01:40,755
对你再忙也有时间
Not for you.

37
00:01:40,755 --> 00:01:43,935
我到底该怎么对付你的上级
How the hell do I handle your boss?

38
00:01:45,585 --> 00:01:48,195
市长今天在法庭上失态了吗
The mayor didn't behave himself in court today?

39
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:50,595
他的竞选顾问
His campaign consultant

40
00:01:50,595 --> 00:01:52,775
从他的再竞选基金里
embezzles a quarter of a million dollars

41
00:01:52,785 --> 00:01:54,145
挪用了二十五万美元
from his reelection fund.

42
00:01:54,145 --> 00:01:56,815
市长是我的重要证人 但他却没出庭
The mayor is my star witness, and he's a no-show.

43
00:01:56,815 --> 00:01:58,705
他说原因了吗
Did he say why?

44
00:01:58,705 --> 00:02:00,605
市里的紧急公务
Urgent city business.

45
00:02:00,605 --> 00:02:02,325
我们总有这种情况呀
We've been known to have that.

46
00:02:02,325 --> 00:02:05,945
要是真有那么紧急 你就应该知道是什么事
If it was that urgent, you would have known about it.

47
00:02:07,215 --> 00:02:11,495
看样子他并不愿意在宣誓后被提问
It sounds like he didn't want to be questioned under oath.

48
00:02:11,495 --> 00:02:12,415
是的
Yeah.

49
00:02:12,415 --> 00:02:14,165
你觉得是怎么回事
What's that tell you?

50
00:02:14,165 --> 00:02:16,455
我觉得他有一些事没有告诉我
That there's something he's not telling me.

51
00:02:16,455 --> 00:02:19,725
如果他拒绝作证
If he refuses to testify...

52
00:02:19,725 --> 00:02:20,925
你有传讯他的权力
You have subpoena power.

53
00:02:20,925 --> 00:02:22,975
传讯咱们的上级吗
Subpoena our mutual boss?

54
00:02:22,975 --> 00:02:24,625
结局必定双输
Talk about a lose-lose.

55
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:28,395
荣誉属于那些有真才实干的人
The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,

56
00:02:28,405 --> 00:02:32,855
即使他失败了 至少他勇敢地去尝试了
who, at worst, if he fails... fails while daring greatly.

57
00:02:32,855 --> 00:02:34,635
说得好
Nice words.

58
00:02:34,635 --> 00:02:37,495
这不是我说的 是罗斯福局长说的
They're not mine, they're Commissioner Roosevelt's.

59
00:02:42,315 --> 00:02:43,985
看样子根本没人在乎
Nobody seems too concerned

60
00:02:43,985 --> 00:02:45,995
有一个持枪的疯子正在这儿晃悠
About a crazed gunman on the loose.

61
00:02:46,005 --> 00:02:48,165
哪边走
Which way?

62
00:02:48,165 --> 00:02:50,455
如果这是个报假警的话咱就去吃饭吧
To lunch, if this is 90-X.

63
00:02:50,455 --> 00:02:52,505
这不是咱能做主的 文 拜托
Not our call, Vin. Come on.

64
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,775
好吧
Fine.

65
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:56,425
你往右走 我往左走
You go right; I'll go left.

66
00:02:56,425 --> 00:02:57,995
这样不太好吧
Not a good idea.

67
00:02:57,995 --> 00:02:59,995
咱们一人一半省时间
Hey, twice the ground, half the time.

68
00:02:59,995 --> 00:03:03,595
要是你发现了什么可疑情况 就呼叫我
Put it over the air if you see anything.

69
00:03:16,315 --> 00:03:17,645
真抱歉我迟到了
I'm so sorry I'm late.

70
00:03:17,645 --> 00:03:19,785
我差点就不等你了
I was just about to give up on you.

71
00:03:30,495 --> 00:03:32,715
文 你听得到吗
Vin, you on the air?

72
00:03:35,085 --> 00:03:36,545
文 听见了吗
Hey, Vin, you on the air?

73
00:03:39,205 --> 00:03:41,055
女士 麻烦你离开这儿 
Ma'am, I need you to exit the park, please.

74
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:43,055
这边 谢谢
This way. Thanks.

75
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:46,395
你个渣滓 狗娘养的
Piece of garbage son of a bitch!

76
00:03:46,395 --> 00:03:48,345
先生 把双手放在我能看见的地方
Sir, I need to see your hands right now.

77
00:03:48,345 --> 00:03:50,815
- 你想看我的手 是吗  - 露出手来
- Oh, you want to see my hands? Huh?  - Show me your hands.

78
00:03:50,815 --> 00:03:52,595
- 手在这儿呢  - 把枪扔了
- Here's my hands.  - Hey, drop the gun!

79
00:03:52,605 --> 00:03:54,885
- 你以为我怕你吗  - 马上把枪扔掉
- You think I'm a coward?  - Drop the gun right now!

80
00:03:54,885 --> 00:03:56,265
把它放在地上
Put it on the ground!

81
00:03:57,335 --> 00:03:58,185
放下
Drop it!

82
00:03:59,385 --> 00:04:00,495
别做傻事
Don't do it!

83
00:04:14,405 --> 00:04:16,925
呼叫总部  请马上派辆救护车过来
Central, we need a bus forthwith at this location.

84
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:18,245
出了什么事
What happened?

85
00:04:18,245 --> 00:04:21,045
注意 这是一起警员枪击案
Be advised, this is a police-involved shooting.

86
00:04:21,045 --> 00:04:23,625
请另派支援小组和一名督导员
Requesting 10-85 and a supervisor...

87
00:04:24,545 --> 00:04:26,545
你没事吧
Are you okay?

88
00:04:45,435 --> 00:04:48,435

99
00:04:59,825 --> 00:05:02,585
警 察 世 家

100
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:11,012
我知道你这是第一次 孩子 但是还得按流程来
I know it's your first time, kid, but, uh, here's the drill.

101
00:05:11,022 --> 00:05:12,182
没收我的枪 做弹道检查
Confiscate my gun, run ballistics,

102
00:05:12,182 --> 00:05:13,572
确保一切合法
make sure everything's copacetic.

103
00:05:13,572 --> 00:05:16,022
同时 我可以使用非当班武器
In the meantime, I'm free to use my off-duty weapon.

104
00:05:16,022 --> 00:05:18,162
根据规章 你会被分配到行政岗位
As per protocol, you'll be placed on administrative duty...

105
00:05:18,162 --> 00:05:19,362
值班三次 我明白
Three tours; I got it.

106
00:05:19,362 --> 00:05:20,962
警官 我很感谢你的关心
Sarge... look, I appreciate the hand-holding,

107
00:05:20,962 --> 00:05:22,382
但是我想尽快接受
but I'd like to get my interview

108
00:05:22,382 --> 00:05:24,462
枪击审查部门的调查 如果可以的话
with the shooting team over with, if that's okay.

109
00:05:24,462 --> 00:05:26,082
不可以 你下一步应该是
No, it's not okay. The next step is,

110
00:05:26,082 --> 00:05:28,382
去医院接受心理创伤检查
you go to the hospital and get checked out for trauma.

111
00:05:28,382 --> 00:05:29,802
没必要 警官
It's not necessary, Sarge.

112
00:05:29,802 --> 00:05:32,372
每个警察枪击后都得接受检查 不管是什么情况
Every cop goes after every shooting, fatal or not.

113
00:05:32,372 --> 00:05:34,672
在医生通过你的审核之前 
And the investigator isn't allowed to talk to you

114
00:05:34,672 --> 00:05:36,092
你不能接受调查人员的讯问
till the doc clears you.

115
00:05:36,092 --> 00:05:38,642
我没做错 我根本没得选
I didn't do anything wrong; he didn't give me a choice.

116
00:05:39,392 --> 00:05:42,152
真是疯了
It was crazy.

117
00:05:42,152 --> 00:05:44,262
这就是我要说的 明白吗
That's what I'm talking about, right?

118
00:05:44,272 --> 00:05:46,402
自我怀疑开始一点点侵入你的头脑
Little self-doubts start creeping in.

119
00:05:46,402 --> 00:05:47,952
接受检查可以让你头脑变得清醒
This way, it gives you time to clear your head.

120
00:05:47,982 --> 00:05:49,222
好的
Yeah,

121
00:05:49,222 --> 00:05:50,492
所以 你不要说些傻话
so you don't go saying something stupid

122
00:05:50,492 --> 00:05:52,072
像是 “我没必要开枪打他的”
like, "Well, I didn't have to shoot him."

123
00:05:52,072 --> 00:05:53,322
嘿 丹尼 你在这儿干什么
Hey, Danny, what are you doing here?

124
00:05:53,332 --> 00:05:54,442
虽然我说了不算 但我还是觉得
It's not my call, but I don't think

125
00:05:54,442 --> 00:05:55,892
他们不会让你接手这个案子的 雷根
they're gonna allow you to work this one, Reagan.

126
00:05:55,892 --> 00:05:57,702
我只是来看看我弟弟 警官
I'm just checking up on my kid brother, Sarge.

127
00:05:57,702 --> 00:06:00,202
要是风纪组谁有意见的 可以来咬我啊
If anyone at IA got a problem with it, they can bite me.

128
00:06:00,202 --> 00:06:01,422
你还好吧
You okay?

129
00:06:01,422 --> 00:06:03,232
嗯 我没事 我没得选
Yeah, I'm fine. He didn't give me a choice.

130
00:06:03,242 --> 00:06:04,842
好 听你头儿的话 好吗
All right, well, listen to your boss, okay?

131
00:06:04,842 --> 00:06:06,042
去医院吧
Now, get to the hospital.

132
00:06:06,042 --> 00:06:07,622
去圣维克医院吧 琳达今天值班
In fact, go to St. Vic's. Linda's working.

133
00:06:07,622 --> 00:06:09,292
好的
Yeah, okay.

134
00:06:09,292 --> 00:06:10,872
要搭车什么的吗
You need a ride or anything?

135
00:06:10,882 --> 00:06:11,932
不了 我没事
No, I'm good.

136
00:06:11,932 --> 00:06:13,182
- 真的  - 嗯
- Yeah?  - Yeah.

137
00:06:13,182 --> 00:06:15,462
好 我为你骄傲 小子
Okay. I'm proud of you, kid.

138
00:06:15,462 --> 00:06:17,182
你挽救了无数条生命
No telling how many lives you saved.

139
00:06:17,182 --> 00:06:18,732
- 谢谢你 警官  - 没事
- Thanks, Sarge.  - All right.

140
00:06:18,732 --> 00:06:19,772
嗨 席德
Yo, Sid!

141
00:06:20,772 --> 00:06:22,692
有什么我能效劳的吗 丹尼
What can I do for you, Danny?

142
00:06:22,692 --> 00:06:24,272
- 你是来这儿观光的吗  - 你懂的
- You just here sightseeing?  - Ah, you know,

143
00:06:24,272 --> 00:06:26,472
我抵抗不了这道拱门的诱惑
I couldn't resist this view of the arch.

144
00:06:26,482 --> 00:06:28,592
- 确实不错  - 是啊 你知道还有谁
- Nice view.  - Yeah. Well, you know who else

145
00:06:28,592 --> 00:06:30,942
- 也抗拒不了这景观吗  - 媒体
- isn't gonna be able to resist it?  - The media?

146
00:06:30,952 --> 00:06:32,362
没错 够精明 席德
That's right. Sharp as a tack, Sid.

147
00:06:32,362 --> 00:06:34,362
媒体会对此大做文章的
The press is gonna have a field day with this.

148
00:06:34,372 --> 00:06:36,032
那我还是赶紧回去工作吧
Well, I guess I better get to work, then.

149
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:37,532
是啊 这个家伙是什么来头
Yeah. What's this thug's story?

150
00:06:37,542 --> 00:06:38,622
我弟弟除掉了他
How big a hero is

151
00:06:38,622 --> 00:06:39,942
会有多风光啊
my kid brother for taking him out?

152
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:42,212
他叫盖文・布莱恩特 家住高档社区
Name is Gavin Bryant. Swanky address.

153
00:06:42,212 --> 00:06:43,772
天网恢恢啊
Well, crime pays.

154
00:06:43,782 --> 00:06:45,492
- 没犯罪记录  - 不会吧
- No criminal record.  - Really?

155
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:48,552
他枪里总不至于装的是橡皮糖吧
Well, I don't think his gun shoots gumdrops and lollipops.

156
00:06:48,552 --> 00:06:50,002
好吧 他有个满仓的弹夹
Well, he had a fully loaded magazine,

157
00:06:50,002 --> 00:06:52,452
但没有上膛 枪擦得锃亮
but nothing in the chamber; gun is clean as a whistle.

158
00:06:52,452 --> 00:06:54,122
看起来最近应该没开过枪
Doesn't look like it's been fired recently.

159
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,722
好吧 没开过枪
Well, just because he didn't fire it

160
00:06:55,722 --> 00:06:57,792
并不代表他没用它犯过罪
doesn't he didn't use it to commit a crime.

161
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,312
检查下这一地区有没有过其它报警电话
Check the SPRINT System for other 911 calls in the area?

162
00:07:00,312 --> 00:07:01,842
谢谢提醒 丹尼
Oh, thanks for the tip, Danny--

163
00:07:01,842 --> 00:07:03,342
我仅仅当了十年刑警而已
I only been a detective ten years.

164
00:07:03,352 --> 00:07:04,682
我查过了 没发现
I checked; nothing popped.

165
00:07:04,682 --> 00:07:06,232
好吧 你能继续调查吗
All right, can you just keep looking?

166
00:07:06,232 --> 00:07:08,432
这事儿可是事关我弟弟 好吗
This is my kid brother we're talking about here, all right?

167
00:07:08,432 --> 00:07:11,132
这家伙招来了个警察 他不可能是清白的
This guy drew down on a cop; there's no way he's clean.

168
00:07:12,142 --> 00:07:13,972
谢谢了
Thanks.

169
00:07:13,972 --> 00:07:16,972
多亏了附近群众的合作
And thanks to the cooperation of the neighborhood,

170
00:07:16,982 --> 00:07:19,362
所有劫匪都被逮捕了
all the looters were apprehended.

171
00:07:19,362 --> 00:07:20,942
有什么问题吗
Questions?

172
00:07:20,952 --> 00:07:22,452
局长
Commissioner,

173
00:07:22,452 --> 00:07:25,122
华盛顿广场公园枪击案有什么最新进展吗
any update on the Washington Square Park shooting?

174
00:07:25,122 --> 00:07:26,422
谢谢 海伦
Thank you, Helen.

175
00:07:26,422 --> 00:07:28,452
我接下来正要讲这件事
That was my next item.

176
00:07:28,452 --> 00:07:32,122
持枪者名叫盖文・布莱恩特 是名收入不错
The gunman, Gavin Bryant, was gainfully employed

177
00:07:32,122 --> 00:07:33,872
的企业高管猎头
as a corporate headhunter.

178
00:07:33,882 --> 00:07:36,112
已婚并有两个小孩子
Married with two young children,

179
00:07:36,112 --> 00:07:37,762
还是一名教会活跃份子
active in his church.

180
00:07:37,762 --> 00:07:38,932
他的邻居和同事
The neighbors and coworkers

181
00:07:38,932 --> 00:07:40,482
对此都感到非常震惊
that we've spoken to expressed shock.

182
00:07:40,482 --> 00:07:42,172
谁都没想到会发生这样的事
None of them saw this coming.

183
00:07:42,172 --> 00:07:44,522
他的动机目前还不明确
His motive is not yet known,

184
00:07:44,522 --> 00:07:46,802
但调查仍在进行中
but the investigation is still ongoing.

185
00:07:46,812 --> 00:07:49,062
有市民在交火中受伤吗
Were any civilians injured in the crossfire?

186
00:07:49,062 --> 00:07:50,062
没有
Not one.

187
00:07:50,062 --> 00:07:51,732
难以想象 鉴于当时人数之众
Miraculous, given the size of the crowd.

188
00:07:51,732 --> 00:07:53,282
警长 有传言说涉案的警官是你的儿子
Commissioner, can you confirm the rumor

189
00:07:53,282 --> 00:07:55,452
你能证实一下这件事吗
that the officer involved is your son?

190
00:07:56,952 --> 00:07:59,902
据我所知 持枪者并没有开枪
I understand the gunman didn't fire a single shot.

191
00:07:59,902 --> 00:08:02,092
为什么你的儿子不用电击枪制服他
Why didn't your son just Taser him?

192
00:08:02,092 --> 00:08:04,452
嗯 首先 乔纳森
Well, first of all, Jonathan,

193
00:08:04,462 --> 00:08:07,162
着装警员不会携带有前科犯人的文件资料
uniform officers do not carry CED's.

194
00:08:07,162 --> 00:08:08,242
也许他们应该带
Well, maybe they should.

195
00:08:08,242 --> 00:08:10,292
难道这就是纽约警局对付
So is this the NYPD's official policy

196
00:08:10,302 --> 00:08:12,212
精神病患者的方式吗
for dealing with the mentally ill?

197
00:08:12,212 --> 00:08:13,632
持枪者并没有前科
The gunman had no history of...

198
00:08:13,632 --> 00:08:15,252
那是不可知的
That was unknowable.

199
00:08:15,252 --> 00:08:16,202
他就是一个持枪者
He was a man

200
00:08:16,202 --> 00:08:17,922
众多无辜百姓生命处于险境
with a gun, and lives were at stake.

201
00:08:17,922 --> 00:08:21,562
你儿子是否尝试击落他手中枪
Did your son even try to... shoot the gun out of his hand?

202
00:08:23,342 --> 00:08:25,312
你问到的警官
The officer in question

203
00:08:25,312 --> 00:08:27,682
严格遵守了警方制度
was adhering to department policy,

204
00:08:27,682 --> 00:08:30,212
那就是 当情况需要时
that is, to use deadly physical force

205
00:08:30,222 --> 00:08:32,382
应当采取致命的武力措施
when the situation requires,

206
00:08:32,382 --> 00:08:34,402
完全符合本案的情况
which it did in this instance.

207
00:08:34,402 --> 00:08:37,022
我局所有警员受训时有关开火的规定
And all my officers are trained to shoot

208
00:08:37,022 --> 00:08:40,322
是以解除险情为目的 并非致命
until the threat is eliminated, not to kill.

209
00:08:40,332 --> 00:08:43,662
那问题就是你儿子枪法也太准了吧
So the problem was your son is too good a shot.

210
00:08:43,662 --> 00:08:45,902
好吧
All right.

211
00:08:47,202 --> 00:08:49,332
让我们假设一下
Let's just say...

212
00:08:49,342 --> 00:08:52,372
持枪者没有瞄准那群学校的孩子们
that the gunman wasn't aiming at a group of schoolchildren,

213
00:08:52,372 --> 00:08:54,502
而是瞄准你 在他扣动扳机之前
but at you-- you have a second

214
00:08:54,512 --> 00:08:57,012
你只有一秒钟时间 你会怎样做
before he pulls the trigger. What do you do?

215
00:08:57,012 --> 00:08:58,592
嗯 首先
Well, first of all...

216
00:08:58,592 --> 00:08:59,632
太迟了 你已经死了
Too late. You're dead.

217
00:09:01,752 --> 00:09:03,752
呃 澄清一下 这只是
Uh, to be clear, the commissioner

218
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,922
局长的假设而已
was speaking hypothetically.

219
00:09:15,762 --> 00:09:17,892
那么 我能尽快见到医生吗
So, do I get to see the doc anytime soon?

220
00:09:17,902 --> 00:09:20,282
听丹尼的意思 你在这说话还算好使的
Danny led me to believe you had some pull around here.

221
00:09:20,282 --> 00:09:22,752
在我给你检查的时候你安静点 好吗
You need to be quiet while I get a reading, okay?

222
00:09:22,752 --> 00:09:25,942
你知道的 我检查完你要害部位后医生就会来
You know, the doc'll be in as soon as I check your vitals.

223
00:09:30,212 --> 00:09:32,712
好了
Okay.

224
00:09:32,712 --> 00:09:34,802
你感觉如何
So, how you feeling?

225
00:09:34,802 --> 00:09:35,952
很好
Fine.

226
00:09:35,952 --> 00:09:37,112
- 是吗 - 是的
- Yeah? - Yeah.

227
00:09:37,122 --> 00:09:39,422
你的血压看起来不是那么回事
Well, your blood pressure says differently.

228
00:09:39,422 --> 00:09:40,832
已经过高压临界值了
It's through the roof.

229
00:09:40,842 --> 00:09:42,172
是啊 怪不得我
Yeah, that's on account of this ringing

230
00:09:42,172 --> 00:09:43,592
耳朵里有嗡嗡声 挺烦人的
in my ear-- it's a little annoying.

231
00:09:43,592 --> 00:09:45,422
是开枪后才开始的吗
That start after the shooting?

232
00:09:45,422 --> 00:09:47,622
是的
Yeah.

233
00:09:47,632 --> 00:09:49,462
就是耳鸣
Well, that's tinnitus.

234
00:09:49,462 --> 00:09:51,292
枪击后这种现象很普遍
That's common with gunshots.

235
00:09:51,302 --> 00:09:52,852
不是我幻想的就好
I'm not imagining it.

236
00:09:52,852 --> 00:09:55,652
不是 我没有说是你幻想的
No, I didn't say you were imagining it.

237
00:09:55,652 --> 00:09:58,072
我只是说 你不必担心
I'm just saying that... you don't need to worry,

238
00:09:58,072 --> 00:09:59,742
它会自行消失的
it'll go away on its own.

239
00:09:59,742 --> 00:10:02,742
那么这些都是浪费时间了 是吧
Then this was all a waste of time, right?

240
00:10:02,742 --> 00:10:03,742
当然不是
No, it's not...

241
00:10:03,742 --> 00:10:06,162
坐下 我还没检查完
Sit down, I'm not done with you.

242
00:10:06,162 --> 00:10:08,142
你知道吗 你的症状
You know what, what you went through

243
00:10:08,152 --> 00:10:09,452
是属于创伤性的
was a traumatic thing.

244
00:10:09,452 --> 00:10:12,282
对谁都一样 看着我
For anyone. Look at me.

245
00:10:12,282 --> 00:10:14,532
丹尼也经常卷入枪击案中 不止一次
Danny's been involved in shootings; more than one.

246
00:10:14,542 --> 00:10:16,292
他也经常像我这样倍受关照吗
Does he usually get this pity party?

247
00:10:16,292 --> 00:10:17,792
这不是关照你 吉米
This is not a pity party, Jamie.

248
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:20,092
你知道吗 如果你认为那些症状
And you know what, if you think all that stuff

249
00:10:20,092 --> 00:10:21,712
没有困扰你那男子汉大丈夫哥哥
doesn't bother your big macho brother,

250
00:10:21,712 --> 00:10:23,162
那你就是一点也不了解他
then you don't know him.

251
00:10:23,162 --> 00:10:24,382
我只是按受训时要求的去做
I did what I was trained to do.

252
00:10:24,382 --> 00:10:25,662
我不会因为这件事一蹶不振
I'm not gonna fall apart over it.

253
00:10:25,662 --> 00:10:27,552
很好
Good.

254
00:10:27,552 --> 00:10:28,932
你知道么 吉米
You know, Jamie...

255
00:10:28,932 --> 00:10:31,602
这种情况下的人
people in these situations,

256
00:10:31,602 --> 00:10:34,052
倾向于循环经历类似于
they tend to cycle through what looks like

257
00:10:34,062 --> 00:10:35,312
悲痛的五个阶段
the five stages of grief.

258
00:10:35,312 --> 00:10:36,862
包括否认
There's denial,

259
00:10:36,862 --> 00:10:39,982
愤怒 讨价还价 压抑
anger, bargaining, depression...

260
00:10:39,982 --> 00:10:42,182
他要向孩子们开枪 琳
Yeah, he was gonna shoot some kids, Lin, so...

261
00:10:42,182 --> 00:10:44,202
我不会为了这家伙感到悲痛
I'm not gonna grieve over this guy.

262
00:10:44,202 --> 00:10:45,522
我不是这个意思
That's not what I was saying.

263
00:10:45,522 --> 00:10:47,372
- 你知道什么能帮我吗  - 什么
- You know what would help me? - What's that?

264
00:10:47,472 --> 00:10:48,202
就是你去把医生叫来
If you could just go and get the doc,

265
00:10:48,222 --> 00:10:49,362
好让这一切都快点结束
so that I could get this over with.

266
00:10:51,992 --> 00:10:54,162
好吧
Okay.

267
00:10:59,862 --> 00:11:01,382
我有十个目击者
I got ten witnesses

268
00:11:01,382 --> 00:11:04,132
看到你用台球杆猛击那人的头部
saw you bash this guy's head in with a pool cue.

269
00:11:04,142 --> 00:11:06,342
现在保持沉默对你毫无益处
There's no upside to you clamming up now.

270
00:11:06,342 --> 00:11:08,972
你不明白我的米兰达权利吗
What part of my Miranda rights do you not understand?

271
00:11:08,972 --> 00:11:10,212
喂
Yes!

272
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:12,262
是我 方便说话吗
It's me. Can you talk?

273
00:11:12,262 --> 00:11:13,382
等一下
Hold on.

274
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:15,012
你还继续保持沉默吗
You still asserting your right to remain silent?

275
00:11:15,012 --> 00:11:16,652
好 很好 好好跟这儿呆着吧 你个精神病
Yeah. Good, enjoy your stay, psycho.

276
00:11:16,652 --> 00:11:18,722
- 你说什么  - 没有 不是说你
- Excuse me? - No, not you.

277
00:11:18,722 --> 00:11:20,432
什么事
What is it?

278
00:11:20,442 --> 00:11:22,072
关于你弟弟的
It's your brother.

279
00:11:22,072 --> 00:11:23,272
你见过他了 是吧
You saw him, right?

280
00:11:23,272 --> 00:11:24,492
是的 他很好
Yeah, he's good.

281
00:11:24,492 --> 00:11:25,712
的确
Exactly.

282
00:11:25,712 --> 00:11:27,492
怎么好又变成坏事了 琳达
Why is good bad, Linda?

283
00:11:27,492 --> 00:11:30,082
他心理承受这案子的情况还不正常
He's not processing this in a healthy way.

284
00:11:30,082 --> 00:11:31,532
他还处在否认阶段
He's in denial.

285
00:11:31,532 --> 00:11:33,032
喂 慢着 好吗
Whoa, slow down, okay?

286
00:11:33,032 --> 00:11:35,032
这案子才刚发生 他可能还处在惊吓中
This just happened; he's probably still in shock.

287
00:11:35,032 --> 00:11:37,122
相信我 等他想通了 他会感觉到的
Believe me, when it hits him, he's gonna feel it.

288
00:11:37,122 --> 00:11:38,752
好吧 嗯 现在新闻上也在报道
Yeah, well, now they're talking on the news

289
00:11:38,752 --> 00:11:40,502
好像这个持枪者是个好人
like the gunman is this good guy.

290
00:11:40,512 --> 00:11:41,872
我的意思是 这对他没什么好处
I mean, that can't be helping.

291
00:11:41,872 --> 00:11:43,792
宝贝 相信我 一切都会好起来的
Babe, I'm telling you, everything's gonna be fine.

292
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:45,132
听着 我得挂了
Look, I got to go.

293
00:11:45,132 --> 00:11:46,962
好的 爱你
All right, love you.

294
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:50,762
我更爱你
Love you more.

295
00:11:53,102 --> 00:11:54,352
什么风把你吹来了 席德
What brings you down here, Sid?

296
00:11:54,352 --> 00:11:55,592
礼节性拜访
A courtesy call.

297
00:11:55,592 --> 00:11:57,592
我想你可以在新闻播出这件事
I thought you might want to give your brother a heads-up

298
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:58,722
之前给你弟弟提个醒
before this hit the news.

299
00:11:58,722 --> 00:11:59,762
提什么醒
Heads-up about what?

300
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:01,092
我弟弟没做什么错事
My brother didn't do anything off-base.

301
00:12:01,092 --> 00:12:03,642
他是没做错事 但这案情有些离奇了
He didn't, but the case took a bit of a weird turn.

302
00:12:03,652 --> 00:12:05,982
嗯 你想让我猜吗
Well, are you gonna make me guess?

303
00:12:05,982 --> 00:12:07,812
他们调出了原来的911电话记录
They pulled the initial 911 call.

304
00:12:07,822 --> 00:12:10,372
举报者没报名就挂断了电话
Caller hung up without giving his name.

305
00:12:10,372 --> 00:12:12,242
你们做了反向追踪吧
And you did a reverse look-up.

306
00:12:12,242 --> 00:12:13,652
好吧 我知道这件事不止如此
Okay, I knew there was more to this.

307
00:12:13,662 --> 00:12:15,072
那又怎样 举报者跟
So what? The caller's got

308
00:12:15,072 --> 00:12:16,372
盖文・布莱恩特有关系吗
a connection to Gavin Bryant?

309
00:12:16,382 --> 00:12:20,042
也可以这么说
You might say that.

310
00:12:36,562 --> 00:12:38,232
干嘛啊 丹尼
What the hell, Danny?

311
00:12:38,232 --> 00:12:40,902
非得让我向法院对你申请禁令吗
I have to take out a restraining order against you?

312
00:12:40,902 --> 00:12:42,652
你感觉如何 小子
How you doing, kid?

313
00:12:42,652 --> 00:12:45,322
在看到你的大长脸之前都很好 怎么了
All right till I saw the sour look on your face. What's up?

314
00:12:45,322 --> 00:12:49,322
他们追踪到了最初拨打911电话的人
They tracked down the guy who made the initial 911 call.

315
00:12:49,322 --> 00:12:52,442
就是我出警时那个报案人吧 对吧
The one I responded to, yeah?

316
00:12:52,442 --> 00:12:55,812
对 电话是从盖文・布莱恩特的手机里挂的
Yeah. The call came from Gavin Bryant's cell phone.

317
00:12:55,812 --> 00:12:59,332
他自己打的报案电话
He made the call himself.

318
00:12:59,332 --> 00:13:01,122
不可能
That's impossible.

319
00:13:01,122 --> 00:13:03,322
我向他开枪时他身上没有电话
He didn't have a phone on him when I shot him.

320
00:13:03,322 --> 00:13:05,322
我知道 但是我们查看过
I know he didn't, but we checked

321
00:13:05,322 --> 00:13:07,322
公园的安保录像
the security footage in the park.

322
00:13:07,332 --> 00:13:10,542
我们看到盖文在拨打完911电话后立即
We got Gavin chucking his cell phone in the trash

323
00:13:10,552 --> 00:13:12,852
就把他的手机丢到垃圾箱里了
seconds after the 911 call was logged.

324
00:13:12,852 --> 00:13:14,332
他为什么要举报自己
Why would he report himself?

325
00:13:14,332 --> 00:13:15,472
我不明白
I don't...

326
00:13:15,472 --> 00:13:16,602
像他这样的精神状况
A guy in his state of mind,

327
00:13:16,602 --> 00:13:17,882
没人知道他在想什么
there's no telling what he was thinking.

328
00:13:17,892 --> 00:13:18,942
你在说什么 丹尼
What are you talking about, Danny?

329
00:13:18,942 --> 00:13:20,022
他是哪样的精神状况
What state of mind was he in?

330
00:13:20,022 --> 00:13:21,192
看样子
It looks like

331
00:13:21,192 --> 00:13:23,472
他借警察之手 自杀了
he committed suicide... by cop.

332
00:13:25,892 --> 00:13:28,062
自杀
Suicide?

333
00:13:30,232 --> 00:13:33,522
我就是那个替他开枪的倒霉警察
I'm the sucker that he conned into doing it for him.

334
00:13:52,021 --> 00:13:53,491
- 你是  - 布莱恩特夫人吗
- Yes? - Mrs. Bryant?

335
00:13:53,491 --> 00:13:55,891
不是 我会告诉她你来了
No. I'll let her know you're here.

336
00:13:55,891 --> 00:13:57,091
你是
Your name?

337
00:13:57,091 --> 00:13:58,491
吉米
Jamie.

338
00:13:58,491 --> 00:14:00,191
警官吉米・雷根
Officer Jamie Reagan.

339
00:14:00,201 --> 00:14:03,161
你他妈来这儿干嘛
What the hell are you doing here?

340
00:14:03,161 --> 00:14:04,631
康妮
Connie.

341
00:14:05,331 --> 00:14:06,871
让他进来
Let him in.

342
00:14:09,701 --> 00:14:11,421
亚历克斯 亲爱的
Alex, honey,

343
00:14:11,421 --> 00:14:13,591
我需要你看一会你的小妹妹
I'm gonna need you to look after your little sister

344
00:14:13,591 --> 00:14:15,211
没问题吧
for a while, okay?

345
00:14:18,631 --> 00:14:20,961
我们可以在这里谈
We can talk in here.

346
00:14:26,441 --> 00:14:28,641
谢谢
Thank you.

347
00:14:31,231 --> 00:14:32,731
请节哀顺变
I'm so sorry for your loss.

348
00:14:32,731 --> 00:14:34,481
告诉我当时是怎么回事
Tell me why it happened.

349
00:14:34,481 --> 00:14:37,101
为什么你杀了我丈夫
Why did you kill my husband?

350
00:14:37,101 --> 00:14:40,771
我也希望我能给你一个合理的理由
I wish I could make some sense of it for you.

351
00:14:40,771 --> 00:14:42,791
我们的婚姻很稳固
Our marriage was solid.

352
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,371
他的业务也是蒸蒸日上
His business was never better.

353
00:14:44,371 --> 00:14:46,041
他不会自杀
He was not suicidal.

354
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,411
你的丈夫当时很狂躁
Your husband was distraught.

355
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,211
他酗酒么
Had he been drinking?

356
00:14:51,211 --> 00:14:53,211
他已经戒酒15年了
He was 15 years sober.

357
00:14:53,211 --> 00:14:55,421
最近有什么情况么
Had something happened recently?

358
00:14:55,421 --> 00:14:57,001
为什么他
Why was he...

359
00:14:57,001 --> 00:14:59,291
为什么他随身带着枪
Why was he carrying a gun?

360
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:02,141
几周前他在一处治安不好的地方
He did volunteer work a few weeks ago

361
00:15:02,141 --> 00:15:04,561
参加了一个志愿者活动
in a sketchy neighborhood.

362
00:15:04,561 --> 00:15:06,291
也许他带枪是为了防身
Maybe he had it for protection.

363
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:07,731
有人威胁过他么
Had someone threatened him?

364
00:15:07,731 --> 00:15:09,461
别说了
Stop.

365
00:15:09,461 --> 00:15:12,181
我以为你过来是为了帮我弄出究竟
I thought you came here to help me understand.

366
00:15:12,181 --> 00:15:15,151
原来你只是要找自己的答案
You just want answers for yourself.

367
00:15:15,151 --> 00:15:18,141
我绝对不想让你更难过
The last thing I meant to do was upset you more.

368
00:15:18,141 --> 00:15:21,141
你来这不就是希望我告诉你我丈夫是个恶棍
You came here expecting me to say my husband was a monster

369
00:15:21,141 --> 00:15:24,111
这样你就可以对他死心安吗
so you could feel better about killing him.

370
00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:26,611
抱歉 女士 我这就走
I'm sorry, ma'am. I'll go.

371
00:15:26,621 --> 00:15:30,621
你夺走我们家顶梁柱的生命
You killed a wonderful husband and father.

372
00:15:31,671 --> 00:15:34,841
你不会知道这对我意味着什么
You have no idea what you took from me.

373
00:15:45,471 --> 00:15:47,131
艾琳 你还在这里
Erin, you're still here.

374
00:15:47,141 --> 00:15:48,521
你的执着一向是我最佩服的地方
Your tenacity is one of the things

375
00:15:48,521 --> 00:15:50,501
不过我饭局要迟到了
I admire most about you, but I'm late for dinner.

376
00:15:50,511 --> 00:15:52,671
你为什么这么害怕作证呢
Why were you afraid to testify?

377
00:15:54,841 --> 00:15:56,891
咱们到这边来说吧
Why don't we talk over here?

378
00:15:56,901 --> 00:15:58,341
你是我的关键证人
You're my key witness.

379
00:15:58,351 --> 00:15:59,901
陪审员已经宣誓就职了
The jury's already been sworn in.

380
00:15:59,901 --> 00:16:02,681
如果你明天不露面 我们会触犯一案不能双审条例
If you don't show up tomorrow, double jeopardy attaches.

381
00:16:02,681 --> 00:16:04,321
莱恩将无罪释放
Ryan walks free.

382
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:09,371
告诉我你不是这么打算的
Tell me that is not your plan.

383
00:16:09,371 --> 00:16:12,331
艾琳 这事非常复杂
Erin, this is very complicated,

384
00:16:12,331 --> 00:16:14,791
而且今年也是我的竞选年
and it's an election year for me.

385
00:16:14,801 --> 00:16:17,051
所以这次你不适合
So it's not a good time for you

386
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:19,031
上庭宣誓答辩吗
To answer questions under oath?

387
00:16:19,031 --> 00:16:21,251
并不是说我有什么见不得人的东西
Not that I have anything to hide.

388
00:16:21,251 --> 00:16:23,891
但我的线人说被告打算把
But my sources say that the defense plans

389
00:16:23,891 --> 00:16:25,391
这一切全都推到我身上来
To turn this whole thing on me.

390
00:16:25,391 --> 00:16:26,311
怎么推
How?

391
00:16:26,311 --> 00:16:27,471
他们会说莱恩拿的那些
By claiming that the money

392
00:16:27,481 --> 00:16:29,841
钱是私下里用来
That Ryan took was an under-the-table payoff

393
00:16:29,841 --> 00:16:31,141
给我收买选票的报酬
To implement voter fraud.

394
00:16:31,151 --> 00:16:32,551
有这么回事吗
Is there anything to that?

395
00:16:32,551 --> 00:16:34,061
艾琳 你怎么能这么问我
Erin, how could you ask me that?

396
00:16:34,071 --> 00:16:37,821
听着 在法庭上我能保护你
Look, I can protect you in court,

397
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:39,171
但你要告诉我所有他们有可能
but you need to tell me anything

398
00:16:39,181 --> 00:16:41,091
拿来攻击你的事情这样我才能先做好准备
they can throw at you, so I can get ahead of it.

399
00:16:41,331 --> 00:16:43,041
艾琳 你可以随便问
Well, Erin, you can ask me anything you like.

400
00:16:43,841 --> 00:16:44,951
我没什么好隐瞒的
I have nothing to hide.

401
00:16:49,061 --> 00:16:51,411
现在你可不该躲着我 小子
It's not the time for you be ducking me, kid.

402
00:16:51,421 --> 00:16:53,831
你可别忘了 我是你唯一的哥
In case you forgot, I'm the only brother you got.

403
00:16:53,841 --> 00:16:56,071
我现在只求你让我一个人静静 丹尼
I need you to leave me alone right now, Danny.

404
00:16:56,071 --> 00:16:57,701
拜托 我以为我们已经过了这个阶段了
Come on, I thought we went over this already.

405
00:16:57,711 --> 00:17:00,171
嘿 你到底怎么回事啊
Hey, what's going on with you?

406
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:04,581
喂
Huh?

407
00:17:04,581 --> 00:17:06,681
那个寡妇说盖文已经戒酒15年了
The widow said that Gavin was sober 15 years,

408
00:17:06,681 --> 00:17:08,771
但是当时他看起来好像醉了或者嗨了似的
but he seemed drunk or high or something to me.

409
00:17:08,771 --> 00:17:10,471
是啊 这是案子当时的情况
Yeah, that's what's going on with the case.

410
00:17:10,471 --> 00:17:12,051
我是问你到底怎么回事
I said what's going on with you?

411
00:17:12,051 --> 00:17:13,601
- 你真的想知道吗 - 是啊
- You really want to know? - Yeah.

412
00:17:13,611 --> 00:17:15,051
我又生气又沮丧
I-I'm angry and I'm frustrated.

413
00:17:15,061 --> 00:17:17,061
我不再确定我是否适合做一个警察
I'm not sure I'm fit to be a cop anymore.

414
00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:20,061
拜托 你和任何一个我认识的警察一样适合
Oh, come on, you're as fit to be a cop as any cop I know.

415
00:17:20,061 --> 00:17:22,531
万一下一次 因为这次的情况
What if the next time, because of how this went down,

416
00:17:22,531 --> 00:17:25,951
我犹豫了 导致一个无辜的路人被杀了呢
I hesitate and an innocent bystander gets killed?

417
00:17:25,951 --> 00:17:27,281
你不会让那种情况发生的
You won't let that happen.

418
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:28,791
你又不知道
You don't know that.

419
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,291
我当然知道
Yes, I do.

420
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,291
你那一枪干净利落
Look, it was a clean shoot.

421
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,821
嘿
Hey.

422
00:17:37,211 --> 00:17:39,161
听着 我也遇到过你的情形 好吗
Look, I've been where you are, okay?

423
00:17:39,161 --> 00:17:42,081
是这个未解之谜让我们抓狂
It's the unanswered questions that are driving you nuts.

424
00:17:42,081 --> 00:17:44,001
我们不会再找到更多的答案了 对吧
Well, we're not getting any more answers, are we?

425
00:17:44,001 --> 00:17:45,641
谁说的
Says who?

426
00:17:45,641 --> 00:17:48,341
这案子已经被定为正当防卫杀人了
It's already been ruled a justifiable homicide.

427
00:17:48,341 --> 00:17:49,721
调查已经结束
The investigation is over.

428
00:17:49,721 --> 00:17:51,641
纽约警局不会在意一个男人自杀的原因
NYPD doesn't care why a guy killed himself.

429
00:17:51,641 --> 00:17:53,261
好吧 那我们更有理由去
Okay, well, that's all the more reason

430
00:17:53,261 --> 00:17:54,891
查个水落石出了
someone should get to the bottom of it.

431
00:17:54,901 --> 00:17:56,181
可是我暂时只能做文案
Yeah, well, I'm stuck behind a desk.

432
00:17:56,181 --> 00:17:57,351
我倒是想做些什么 但不可以
I'd do something, but I can't.

433
00:17:57,351 --> 00:17:59,971
你是不可以 但我行
Maybe you can't, but I can.

434
00:18:01,151 --> 00:18:03,521
我有私人的时间
I got some personal time.

435
00:18:03,521 --> 00:18:06,611
让我花些日子好好查查 好吗
Let me take a few days and do some sniffing around, all right?

436
00:18:06,611 --> 00:18:08,191
真的吗
Yeah?

437
00:18:08,191 --> 00:18:09,691
真的
Yeah.

438
00:18:11,531 --> 00:18:14,361
好的 去做吧
Okay, do it.

439
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:22,121
雷根警官
Detective Reagan,

440
00:18:22,121 --> 00:18:24,171
你刚刚错过了布莱恩特的尸检
you just missed the Bryant autopsy.

441
00:18:24,181 --> 00:18:25,711
好吧 其实我也从来都没
Yeah, well, never really interested

442
00:18:25,711 --> 00:18:26,881
兴趣看现场尸检
in seeing the actual autopsy.

443
00:18:26,881 --> 00:18:28,541
我只对结果感兴趣
Just interested in seeing the results.

444
00:18:28,551 --> 00:18:30,051
是啊
Mm.

445
00:18:30,051 --> 00:18:32,331
怎么回事 这人有什么不治之症么
What happened? This guy have a terminal illness or something?

446
00:18:32,331 --> 00:18:34,051
除了心室上的
Aside from the hemorrhagic wound track

447
00:18:34,051 --> 00:18:36,471
穿透性伤口以外 他很健康啊
through the cardiac ventricle, he was a fit specimen.

448
00:18:36,471 --> 00:18:38,001
所以没什么不寻常的了？
So nothing was out of place.

449
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:41,141
就是最近的一根趾骨是短指
Just the proximal phalanx of his fifth phalange.

450
00:18:41,141 --> 00:18:42,781
什么
What?

451
00:18:42,781 --> 00:18:44,841
他有一根小指骨折了
He had a fractured pinky finger.

452
00:18:44,851 --> 00:18:46,201
真的么
Really?

453
00:18:46,201 --> 00:18:48,781
像让别人弄断了的一样吗
Consistent like with, uh, somebody breaking it?

454
00:18:48,781 --> 00:18:50,151
比如他债主打断的吗
Like somebody he owed money to?

455
00:18:50,151 --> 00:18:52,701
更像是他打别人打断的
More consistent with him having thrown a punch.

456
00:18:52,701 --> 00:18:55,711
好吧 那毒检呢
All right, what about the tox screen?

457
00:18:55,711 --> 00:18:57,071
有什么结果吗
Anything show up there?

458
00:18:57,081 --> 00:19:01,131
呃 他的血液酒精含量是0.07
Uh, his blood alcohol was .07.

459
00:19:01,131 --> 00:19:02,751
0.07
.07?

460
00:19:02,751 --> 00:19:04,461
那寡妇说他戒酒了
The widow said he was on the wagon.

461
00:19:04,471 --> 00:19:06,671
看来他临终前喝了杯上路酒
Guess he had one for the road.

462
00:19:19,211 --> 00:19:21,931
我回来了 不知道为什么
Here I am; don't know why.

463
00:19:24,721 --> 00:19:27,891
我没打算把你叫到十四楼上
Well, I wasn't about to have you up to the 14th floor.

464
00:19:27,891 --> 00:19:30,371
如果你想喝 那里有咖啡
There's some coffee there, if you want it.

465
00:19:34,751 --> 00:19:36,611
你最近怎么样
So how you holding up?

466
00:19:36,611 --> 00:19:38,531
还好
Okay.

467
00:19:40,371 --> 00:19:43,091
真的假的
Really?

468
00:19:43,091 --> 00:19:44,451
你从事这份工作时
You sign up for the job,

469
00:19:44,461 --> 00:19:46,371
你就知道你有可能要对人开枪的
you know you might have to shoot someone.

470
00:19:48,091 --> 00:19:50,961
95%的警察在他们一生的
95% of the cops go their whole career

471
00:19:50,961 --> 00:19:53,631
工作生涯中都没有在射击场外开过枪
without firing their weapon outside the range.

472
00:19:53,631 --> 00:19:55,451
剩下了5%的警察
Of the five percent that are left,

473
00:19:55,451 --> 00:19:58,101
有多少人第一次开枪就杀了人
how many shot first and killed the guy?

474
00:19:58,101 --> 00:20:00,341
这我不知道
That I do not know.

475
00:20:06,111 --> 00:20:08,951
就是刚刚 咱们警员发生一起误杀
A while ago, we had that bad shooting.

476
00:20:08,951 --> 00:20:11,201
一位母亲失去了儿子
A woman lost her son.

477
00:20:11,201 --> 00:20:13,071
他没做什么错事
He didn't do anything wrong.

478
00:20:13,071 --> 00:20:16,441
他只是在错误的时间出现在了错误的地点
He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

479
00:20:18,491 --> 00:20:20,741
我去看她
I went to see her.

480
00:20:20,741 --> 00:20:24,241
我希望她知道我理解
I wanted her to know that I understood

481
00:20:24,251 --> 00:20:26,451
失去一个孩子的感觉
what it was like to lose a child.

482
00:20:28,881 --> 00:20:31,801
那是个错误
It was a mistake.

483
00:20:31,801 --> 00:20:33,971
没起到一点帮助
It didn't help.

484
00:20:35,811 --> 00:20:38,511
过了一会 我渐渐意识到
With time, I've come to realize

485
00:20:38,511 --> 00:20:44,981
相对于安慰她 更像是在安慰我自己
that it was, well, more for my own consolation than hers.

486
00:20:46,851 --> 00:20:48,801
我要说两点
Two things.

487
00:20:48,801 --> 00:20:50,991
你这次不是误杀
This wasn't a bad shooting,

488
00:20:50,991 --> 00:20:53,361
去看那个女人是一个错误
and it was a mistake to go see that woman.

489
00:20:55,161 --> 00:20:56,741
那我该怎么做
What was I supposed to do?

490
00:20:56,741 --> 00:20:59,651
你没有想要通过警局或者
You didn't think to notify the department or run it

491
00:20:59,651 --> 00:21:01,361
警员慈善协会律师来处理么
by your PBA attorney?

492
00:21:01,371 --> 00:21:03,321
她丈夫的死
I'm responsible...

493
00:21:03,321 --> 00:21:06,501
我负有责任
for her husband's death.

494
00:21:06,501 --> 00:21:10,261
你对那些没被他夺去的生命也负有责任
You're also responsible for the lives he didn't take.

495
00:21:11,261 --> 00:21:13,681
事情已然至此
Don't make this any harder on yourself

496
00:21:13,681 --> 00:21:15,041
就不要再逼自己了
than it already is.

497
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:18,751
说着容易做起来难啊
That's easier said than done.

498
00:21:22,521 --> 00:21:24,501
听我说
Listen...

499
00:21:26,361 --> 00:21:28,341
你正在经历的这些事
There's nothing you're going through,

500
00:21:28,341 --> 00:21:30,481
你可能犯的错
no mistake you can make,

501
00:21:30,481 --> 00:21:34,031
我都遇到过 也经历过
that I haven't already been there, done that.

502
00:21:36,481 --> 00:21:41,071
我知道你现在听不进去
And I know you're not hearing too well right now,

503
00:21:41,071 --> 00:21:45,961
但是别一人承担
but don't try to carry this alone.

504
00:21:45,961 --> 00:21:48,891
那样做很傻
It's a fool's errand,

505
00:21:48,901 --> 00:21:50,411
而你一点也不傻
and you're anything but.

506
00:22:02,511 --> 00:22:04,811
你和他共事九年了吧 你知道
You worked with him for nine years-- you have any idea

507
00:22:04,811 --> 00:22:06,551
他为什么又酒瘾复发了吗
what might've lead to him falling off the wagon?

508
00:22:06,551 --> 00:22:08,811
不可能啊 这工作强度很高的
It never happened, and this is a high-stress business.

509
00:22:08,821 --> 00:22:10,521
哦 是吗 那这个
Oh, yeah-- exactly what is it that

510
00:22:10,521 --> 00:22:12,491
呃 企业猎头到底是干嘛的
a, uh, corporate headhunter does, anyway?

511
00:22:12,491 --> 00:22:16,061
布莱恩特先生受雇于一些世界五百强公司
Mr. Bryant was retained by several Fortune 500 companies

512
00:22:16,061 --> 00:22:19,361
他为这些公司招聘高管
to recruit high-level executives for them.

513
00:22:19,361 --> 00:22:22,781
以现在的经济形势 他还能靠寻找乐意上班的人挣钱吗
In this economy, he's paid to find people willing to work?

514
00:22:22,781 --> 00:22:25,701
佣金是被录用者首年收入的33%
33% of the hire's first-year income.

515
00:22:25,701 --> 00:22:27,781
也许他确实还有些别的招儿挣钱
So maybe he did have something to live for anyway.

516
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:28,921
他可是个好人
He was a good man.

517
00:22:28,921 --> 00:22:31,071
是啊 他也许是个好人但他最近
Yeah, well, he was a good man but he punched

518
00:22:31,071 --> 00:22:32,511
可一拳打别人脸上了
someone in the face recently.

519
00:22:32,511 --> 00:22:33,891
和他争业务的猎头当中有没有人
Any of his rival headhunters show up

520
00:22:33,891 --> 00:22:35,621
眼眶青了或者嘴唇肿了的
with a black eye or a fat lip?

521
00:22:35,631 --> 00:22:37,681
布莱恩特先生从不使用暴力
Mr. Bryant was never violent.

522
00:22:37,681 --> 00:22:39,301
他打人时把小指伤了
He broke his pinky on somebody.

523
00:22:39,301 --> 00:22:41,511
招聘会上有时会发生这种事
That happened somehow at Job Fair.

524
00:22:41,521 --> 00:22:42,851
招聘会是什么
What is Job Fair?

525
00:22:44,301 --> 00:22:46,021
他们会教一些面试技巧
They teach interview skills.

526
00:22:46,021 --> 00:22:48,721
就是为那些不幸之士与其未来雇主牵手
Match up prospective employers with the down-on-their-luck.

527
00:22:48,721 --> 00:22:51,141
布莱恩特先生两周前做个讲座
Mr. Bryant taught a seminar two weeks ago.

528
00:22:51,141 --> 00:22:52,891
好吧 那他从讲座回来时
Right, and he came back from that seminar

529
00:22:52,891 --> 00:22:54,441
小指伤了吧
with a broken pinky.

530
00:22:56,031 --> 00:22:58,861
你还知道这次事后有其它什么后果吗
Any other fallout from this event that you know of?

531
00:22:58,871 --> 00:23:02,771
有个参加了讲座的人来过这
One of the participants showed up here.

532
00:23:02,771 --> 00:23:05,451
布莱恩特先生看着不太高兴 但他还是见了这个人
Mr. Bryant didn't seem too happy about it, but he did see him.

533
00:23:05,461 --> 00:23:07,271
是么
Uh-huh.

534
00:23:08,661 --> 00:23:10,291
然后呢
And?

535
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:13,211
那个男士的眼眶就青了
The gentleman had a black eye.

536
00:23:13,211 --> 00:23:15,381
他眼眶就青
He had a black...

537
00:23:15,381 --> 00:23:17,501
我需要这人的联系方式
I'm gonna need the guy's contact info.

538
00:23:21,121 --> 00:23:24,541
他来过几次电话
He called several times.

539
00:23:25,461 --> 00:23:29,261
泰勒・格林尼 没有回拨的号码
Tyler Greene-- no call-back number.

540
00:23:29,261 --> 00:23:32,061
好 算他倒霉
Right, on account of he was down on his luck.

541
00:23:33,321 --> 00:23:36,141
麻烦你把他名字给我
Write the name down, please.

542
00:23:38,111 --> 00:23:40,321
盖文的讲座很失败
Gavin's seminar was a fiasco.

543
00:23:40,321 --> 00:23:41,941
非常糟糕的那种
Worst case of flop-sweats ever.

544
00:23:41,941 --> 00:23:44,081
呃 有听众的反馈吗
Any, uh, feedback from the audience?

545
00:23:44,081 --> 00:23:45,691
尤其是一个叫泰勒・格林尼的
Specifically from a Tyler Greene?

546
00:23:45,701 --> 00:23:48,281
我在想盖文为什么会那么紧张
Well, I had wondered if that's what made Gavin so nervous,

547
00:23:48,281 --> 00:23:50,281
难道因为前排坐的是他以前的室友么
having his old roommate in the front row.

548
00:23:50,281 --> 00:23:51,371
你刚说什么
Back up.

549
00:23:51,371 --> 00:23:52,591
什么时候大神盖文
When were Gavin the big shot

550
00:23:52,591 --> 00:23:54,491
和无家可归的泰勒・格林尼成为室友的
and Tyler Greene the homeless guy roommates?

551
00:23:54,491 --> 00:23:56,511
他在麻省理工念书的第一年
His freshman year MIT.

552
00:23:56,511 --> 00:23:58,041
泰勒在麻省理工念书吗
Tyler went to MIT?

553
00:23:58,041 --> 00:23:59,461
是啊 至少我贴盖文的传单时
Yeah, at least that's what Tyler told me

554
00:23:59,461 --> 00:24:01,131
泰勒是这么跟我说的
when I posted Gavin's flyer.

555
00:24:01,131 --> 00:24:02,831
对于这个泰勒・格林尼你还了解多少
What else you know about this Tyler Greene?

556
00:24:02,831 --> 00:24:04,681
他以前是个瘾君子 今年洗心革面
He's a former drug addict who showed up this year

557
00:24:04,681 --> 00:24:06,351
决心改变自己的生活
clean and sober, determined to turn his life around.

558
00:24:06,351 --> 00:24:09,051
好的 那你知道我上哪儿能找到他吗
Okay. You know how I can get in touch with this guy?

559
00:24:09,051 --> 00:24:10,141
他 呃
Yeah, he's, uh...

560
00:24:10,141 --> 00:24:11,851
他就在那边呢
he's right over there.

561
00:24:13,671 --> 00:24:17,841
让我猜猜 眼圈已经青了两周那位
Let me guess-- the guy with the two-week-old shiner.

562
00:24:36,031 --> 00:24:37,711
- 泰勒・格林尼  - 我什么都没干
- Tyler Greene. - I didn't do anything.

563
00:24:37,721 --> 00:24:40,551
嘿 冷静点 冷静点
Hey, take it easy, take it easy.

564
00:24:40,551 --> 00:24:42,421
如果我要逮捕你 我早就干了
If I was gonna arrest you, I would've done it already.

565
00:24:42,421 --> 00:24:43,801
放松点
Relax.

566
00:24:43,801 --> 00:24:44,971
身上带什么了吗
Anything on you?

567
00:24:44,971 --> 00:24:47,211
- 有针头或者尖锐物品吗  - 没有
- Any needles or anything sharp? - No.

568
00:24:47,211 --> 00:24:49,481
关于你的前室友我有些问题要问你
Need to ask you some questions about your ex-roommate.

569
00:24:49,481 --> 00:24:50,431
转过来
Turn around.

570
00:24:50,431 --> 00:24:51,891
我和那事没关系呀
I have nothing to do with that.

571
00:24:51,901 --> 00:24:53,351
是么
Really?

572
00:24:53,351 --> 00:24:55,761
你和什么事没关系呀
You had nothing to do with what?

573
00:24:55,771 --> 00:24:57,851
把盖文逼到绝境的事吗
With what pushed Gavin over the edge?

574
00:24:57,851 --> 00:24:59,401
从大学那会我就没见过他了
I hadn't seen him since college.

575
00:24:59,401 --> 00:25:00,721
那你们兄弟会的握手方式
So what is your fraternity handshake--

576
00:25:00,721 --> 00:25:02,041
就是在眼睛上来一拳吗
a punch in the eye?

577
00:25:03,021 --> 00:25:04,561
他打了你 为什么
He did that to you-- why?

578
00:25:04,561 --> 00:25:06,031
我们只是闹着玩的
We were just horsing around.

579
00:25:06,031 --> 00:25:07,831
是么 你知道我怎么看这事吗
Really? You know what I think?

580
00:25:07,831 --> 00:25:09,911
我觉得是你做了什么事才把他逼死了
I think you did something to drive him to his death.

581
00:25:09,911 --> 00:25:10,781
不是的
No...

582
00:25:10,781 --> 00:25:11,781
你要去哪
Where you going?

583
00:25:11,781 --> 00:25:13,121
你说你没有逮捕我
You said I wasn't under arrest.

584
00:25:13,121 --> 00:25:14,571
那就是说我可以走了 不对吗
That means I'm free to go, right?

585
00:25:14,571 --> 00:25:16,451
是的 严格来说是
Yeah, technically.

586
00:25:16,451 --> 00:25:18,841
我很抱歉
Well, I'm sorry.

587
00:25:18,841 --> 00:25:22,211
你抱歉什么 泰勒
What are you sorry about, Tyler?

588
00:25:22,211 --> 00:25:24,591
我真的很想知道
'Cause I'd really like to know.

589
00:25:26,581 --> 00:25:28,461
盖文的死
Gavin's dead.

590
00:25:28,471 --> 00:25:31,081
就让他安息吧
Just... let him rest in peace.

591
00:25:40,796 --> 00:25:43,796
他说让他安息是什么意思
What did he mean "Just let him rest in peace"?

592
00:25:43,796 --> 00:25:46,756
这个泰勒是我们唯一的线索了
This guy Tyler is our only lead.

593
00:25:46,756 --> 00:25:47,836
你怎么就把他放了
How come you let him go?

594
00:25:47,836 --> 00:25:49,186
我必须放了他
I had to let him go.

595
00:25:49,186 --> 00:25:51,006
人家也没犯罪 你想让我怎么做
Guy didn't commit a crime-- what do you want me to do?

596
00:25:51,006 --> 00:25:53,556
第十二区分局 雷根警官 您需要什么帮助吗
12th Precinct, Officer Reagan-- how can I help you?

597
00:25:53,556 --> 00:25:55,226
马上给你接通
I'll connect you.

598
00:25:55,226 --> 00:25:58,096
当你表明身份时他就跑了
The guy fled when you identified yourself.

599
00:25:58,096 --> 00:25:59,426
他不可能跟这事没关系
No way he's right.

600
00:25:59,436 --> 00:26:03,106
吉米 我不能以官方身份出现在那 知道吗
Jamie, I wasn't there in an official capacity, okay?

601
00:26:03,106 --> 00:26:05,986
所以就算我想抓这人 我也不能抓
So even if I wanted to arrest the guy, I couldn't.

602
00:26:05,986 --> 00:26:07,986
而且 咱们想在他找律师前
Besides, the idea is to get the guy to talk

603
00:26:07,996 --> 00:26:09,886
先让他交待
before he lawyers up.

604
00:26:10,856 --> 00:26:13,056
我得和这人谈谈
I need to talk to this guy.

605
00:26:13,066 --> 00:26:15,226
绝对不行 你不能和他谈
Absolutely not-- you're not talking to him.

606
00:26:16,666 --> 00:26:19,756
第十二辖区 雷根警官 您需要什么帮助吗
12th Precinct, Officer Reagan-- how can I help you?

607
00:26:21,406 --> 00:26:23,836
是的 我会派一组警员过去
Yeah, I'll send a unit right over

608
00:26:23,836 --> 00:26:26,506
以打骚扰电话的罪名逮捕你
to arrest you for making nuisance calls.

609
00:26:29,876 --> 00:26:33,466
有女士报警说一个十岁大的孩子不肯铺床
Lady calls to report a ten-year- old for not making her bed.

610
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:36,086
我该怎么办 去崩了她吗
What am I supposed to do-- go shoot her?

611
00:26:36,086 --> 00:26:38,936
你知道吗 他不适合做公关的 警官
You know, PR may not be his true calling, Sarge.

612
00:26:38,936 --> 00:26:42,356
你没有其他更好的地儿去了是吗 丹尼
You don't have anywhere better to be, Danny, huh?

613
00:26:42,356 --> 00:26:43,526
其实我正准备走了 警官
Actually I was just leaving, Sarge.

614
00:26:43,526 --> 00:26:45,476
如果我跟你在这混时间长了
If I hang around here with you too long,

615
00:26:45,476 --> 00:26:46,776
没准我就被纸把手割了
I might get a paper cut.

616
00:26:46,776 --> 00:26:48,946
回头再跟你聊
I'll talk to you later.

617
00:26:50,146 --> 00:26:52,436
听着
Listen...

618
00:26:52,436 --> 00:26:54,986
开枪杀人后 规定你必须
after a fatal shooting, it's mandatory

619
00:26:54,986 --> 00:26:56,876
去见警局心理医生
to see a department shrink.

620
00:26:57,956 --> 00:27:00,206
你得去
You need to do that.

621
00:27:00,206 --> 00:27:01,406
马上
Now.

622
00:27:03,776 --> 00:27:06,416
明白了吗
Okay?

623
00:27:12,636 --> 00:27:15,506
这笔资金的预期目的是什么
What was the intended purpose of the funds in question?

624
00:27:15,506 --> 00:27:17,396
这笔资金是指定用于一个
The fund was earmarked for a program

625
00:27:17,396 --> 00:27:18,896
防范贿选项目的
to safeguard against voter fraud.

626
00:27:18,896 --> 00:27:20,796
这个问题很实际吗
Is that an actual problem?

627
00:27:20,796 --> 00:27:22,596
在我第一轮选举时 有人针对某个
Well, my first election, a targeted a group

628
00:27:22,596 --> 00:27:25,046
经济弱势的选民群体
of economically downtrodden constituents

629
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:27,306
恶意使其反感投票结果
were wrongly turned away from the polls.

630
00:27:27,306 --> 00:27:28,566
我反对
Objection.

631
00:27:28,576 --> 00:27:30,806
理由 斯科尼克先生
On what grounds, Mr. Skolnick?

632
00:27:30,806 --> 00:27:31,806
与本案无关
Relevance?

633
00:27:31,806 --> 00:27:33,406
反对无效
Overruled.

634
00:27:34,196 --> 00:27:35,646
这笔资金就是为了防止
The fund was to prevent that

635
00:27:35,646 --> 00:27:36,916
再发生类似事件
from ever happening again.

636
00:27:36,916 --> 00:27:39,446
那么由谁负责这个项目呢
And who was in charge of this program?

637
00:27:39,446 --> 00:27:41,366
被告人 瑞恩・迈克劳林
The defendant, Ryan McLaughlin.

638
00:27:42,316 --> 00:27:44,366
我没有其他问题了
No further questions.

639
00:27:44,376 --> 00:27:46,656
辩方还要盘问证人吗
Does the defense wish to cross-examine the witness?

640
00:27:46,656 --> 00:27:48,756
是的 法官大人
Extensively, Your Honor.

641
00:27:48,756 --> 00:27:51,046
提醒下 您可是宣过誓的 市长先生
I remind you, you're under oath, Mr. Mayor.

642
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:53,546
这些钱不会只是为了当做支付资金
Weren't these funds just a payoff for implementing...

643
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:54,666
我反对
Objection.

644
00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:55,626
斯科尼克先生
Mr. Skolnick!

645
00:27:55,636 --> 00:27:57,166
- 只是在  - 有异议
- only after... - Argumentative.

646
00:27:57,166 --> 00:27:58,046
律师先生
Counselor!

647
00:27:58,056 --> 00:27:59,096
你要把我的客户置于死地
You threw my client under the bus.

648
00:27:59,106 --> 00:28:00,836
这是骚扰证人
Badgering the witness.

649
00:28:00,836 --> 00:28:03,166
斯科尼克先生 坐下
Mr. Skolnick, sit down!

650
00:28:06,356 --> 00:28:07,156
反对有效
Sustained.

651
00:28:07,156 --> 00:28:09,326
证人不是在接受审判 辩方显然
The witness is not on trial, Defense clearly doesn't

652
00:28:09,336 --> 00:28:10,166
站不住脚
have a leg to stand on.

653
00:28:10,196 --> 00:28:12,256
雷根女士 我已经认定了你的反对有效
Ms. Reagan, I already sustained your objections.

654
00:28:14,786 --> 00:28:16,236
现在是周五下午了
It's Friday afternoon.

655
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,256
也应该让评审团走了
I think we should let the jury go.

656
00:28:18,256 --> 00:28:20,256
你不能与任何人讨论此案
You are not to discuss this case.

657
00:28:20,256 --> 00:28:22,026
市长先生
Mr. Mayor?

658
00:28:22,026 --> 00:28:23,356
期待与您
I expect that we will see you

659
00:28:23,356 --> 00:28:26,156
在周一早上的最终庭审上见面
for finish cross-examination Monday morning?

660
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:28,196
9点半准时开始
9:30 sharp.

661
00:28:29,696 --> 00:28:31,136
休庭
Court is adjourned.

662
00:28:32,866 --> 00:28:35,136
谢谢你反应这么及时
I appreciate you shutting him down so quickly.

663
00:28:35,136 --> 00:28:37,206
他准备在周一的时候再次对我猛攻
He's gonna have another crack at me on Monday.

664
00:28:37,206 --> 00:28:38,956
他不会再揪着那些问题不放的
Not on that line of questioning, he isn't.

665
00:28:38,956 --> 00:28:40,036
艾琳
Erin?

666
00:28:40,046 --> 00:28:41,506
说曹操曹操就到
Speak of the devil.

667
00:28:41,516 --> 00:28:44,176
我认为你不止隐瞒证据
I thought you were above withholding evidence.

668
00:28:44,176 --> 00:28:45,676
我会花一整个周末的时间来起草
I'm gonna spend the weekend drafting

669
00:28:45,686 --> 00:28:47,516
一项提案来制裁你
a motion against you for sanctions.

670
00:28:47,516 --> 00:28:48,736
制裁我什么
Sanctions for what?

671
00:28:48,736 --> 00:28:50,736
你才应该因当在审案例的证人
And you should be brought up on sanctions for discussing

672
00:28:50,736 --> 00:28:53,276
面讨论案情被制裁
this case in front of a witness that's still on the stand.

673
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:58,356
你不该隐瞒开脱罪责证据的 艾琳
You shouldn't withhold exculpatory evidence, Erin.

674
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:03,736
他什么意思
Do you know what he's talking about?

675
00:29:03,736 --> 00:29:04,746
我不知道
I have no idea.

676
00:29:04,756 --> 00:29:07,286
没人会在无证据支持的情况下
You don't file sanctions against an ADA

677
00:29:07,286 --> 00:29:08,536
提出制裁助理地区检察官的
with nothing to back it up.

678
00:29:08,536 --> 00:29:09,616
艾琳 他在虚张声势
Erin, he's bluffing.

679
00:29:09,626 --> 00:29:12,006
好吧 如果他真有哪怕
Okay, but if he has found evidence

680
00:29:12,006 --> 00:29:14,596
一点点我开脱罪责证据 而且他又说服
that's even remotely exculpatory, and he convinces

681
00:29:14,596 --> 00:29:17,296
法官我是明知故犯 那我可就要被取消从业资格了
the judge that I knew about it, I could be disbarred.

682
00:29:17,296 --> 00:29:19,936
艾琳 我向你保证
Erin, I promise you,

683
00:29:19,936 --> 00:29:22,216
你就放一百个心吧 没事的
you have absolutely nothing to worry about.

684
00:29:30,026 --> 00:29:33,476
我还以为有个沙发躺躺
I thought I'd have to lie down on a couch.

685
00:29:33,476 --> 00:29:35,926
喔 那可太贵了 政府经费不允许
Oh, we can't afford those on a government budget.

686
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:39,196
不过如果你想坐的话 就坐吧
You can take a seat, though, if you like.

687
00:29:40,066 --> 00:29:41,816
得 这枪击案子的故事
Great, I get to tell my shooting story

688
00:29:41,826 --> 00:29:43,376
我都快讲烂了
for the hundredth time.

689
00:29:43,376 --> 00:29:46,206
不 没必要
No, you don't have to do that.

690
00:29:46,206 --> 00:29:47,626
这只是创伤报告
This is a trauma debriefing.

691
00:29:47,626 --> 00:29:49,876
不是心理评估
It's not a psych evaluation.

692
00:29:49,876 --> 00:29:53,046
你现在说的一切都是保密的 也不会有任何记录的
Everything you say here is confidential and off the record.

693
00:29:53,046 --> 00:29:54,616
我不会记笔录 也不会跟
I'm not taking notes, I'm not reporting

694
00:29:54,616 --> 00:29:55,796
警局报告
back to the department.

695
00:29:55,806 --> 00:29:58,836
好吧 那为啥还是强制的
Right, so why is it mandatory then?

696
00:29:58,836 --> 00:30:01,786
这只是个预防性的措施
It's a preventative service.

697
00:30:01,796 --> 00:30:03,796
防止啥
Preventing what?

698
00:30:03,796 --> 00:30:05,806
创伤后精神紧张性障碍
Post-traumatic stress disorder.

699
00:30:05,816 --> 00:30:07,926
我没有症状
Yeah, I don't have that.

700
00:30:07,936 --> 00:30:10,316
大多数有你这种经历的人都会出现
Most people experience low to moderate symptoms

701
00:30:10,316 --> 00:30:12,766
低度至中度症状
after an incident like this.

702
00:30:12,766 --> 00:30:16,016
他们通常需要几周的时间来缓解
They usually resolve themselves in a couple of weeks.

703
00:30:16,026 --> 00:30:20,106
我只是告诉你些注意事项
This is just to let you know what to look out for.

704
00:30:20,106 --> 00:30:24,116
我可没有创伤后紧张性精神障碍
Door slams, you jump out of your skin-- I don't have PTSD.

705
00:30:24,116 --> 00:30:26,946
还有 比较易怒
Also, irritability.

706
00:30:28,986 --> 00:30:32,506
好吧 我确实有点
Yeah, okay, I have a little bit of that.

707
00:30:32,506 --> 00:30:35,486
头疼啊 心跳过速啊
Headaches, rapid heart rate.

708
00:30:35,496 --> 00:30:38,956
思想受干扰
Intrusive thoughts.

709
00:30:38,966 --> 00:30:41,496
事故发生时的情形在脑子里面反复循环
Reliving the experience over and over in your head,

710
00:30:41,496 --> 00:30:44,216
使劲想改变结果
trying to change the outcome.

711
00:30:44,216 --> 00:30:48,186
最后一个 我有
The last one, I do that.

712
00:31:03,016 --> 00:31:04,866
那块猪排你是不是不吃了
You gonna let that pork chop go to waste?

713
00:31:04,876 --> 00:31:07,286
你要是不吃的话 就给我吧
'Cause if you are, you know, I'll take it off your hands.

714
00:31:08,856 --> 00:31:10,626
- 谢谢 - 吉米叔叔
- Thank you. - Uncle Jamie,

715
00:31:10,626 --> 00:31:13,546
瑞奇・沙利文要我谢谢你救了他一命
Richie Sullivan wanted me to thank you for saving his life.

716
00:31:13,546 --> 00:31:14,996
谁是瑞奇・沙利文
Who's Richie Sullivan?

717
00:31:14,996 --> 00:31:17,216
我们跆拳道课的同学
A guy in our Tae Kwon Do class.

718
00:31:18,136 --> 00:31:20,136
他在去我们学校实地考查的时候
He was on our school field trip

719
00:31:20,136 --> 00:31:22,056
被人用枪指着
and a man pointed a gun right at him.

720
00:31:22,056 --> 00:31:24,036
你救了他们
You saved them.

721
00:31:24,036 --> 00:31:26,136
瑞奇本来就没啥危险 兄弟
Richie was never in any real danger, bud.

722
00:31:26,146 --> 00:31:29,176
跟瑞奇・沙利文说 你叔叔说不客气
Tell Richie Sullivan your uncle said he's welcome.

723
00:31:29,176 --> 00:31:32,476
跆拳道 哈
Tae Kwon Do, huh?

724
00:31:32,486 --> 00:31:34,816
你是怎么被他们说服的 琳达阿姨
How'd you let them talk you into that one, Aunt Linda?

725
00:31:34,816 --> 00:31:37,486
他们说这是个需要高度集中精神且纪律严明的运动
Well, they sold me on the focus and discipline,

726
00:31:37,486 --> 00:31:40,576
但是就我目测的结果 就是各种脚踢
but all I've seen so far is a lot of kicking.

727
00:31:40,576 --> 00:31:43,056
还有各种拳打
And punching

728
00:31:43,056 --> 00:31:44,576
和各种攻击
and striking.

729
00:31:44,576 --> 00:31:47,416
他一般会挠挠后脑勺
He scratches the back of his head

730
00:31:47,416 --> 00:31:49,996
在他忽悠你的时候
when he's bluffing.

731
00:31:49,996 --> 00:31:51,946
谁啊
Who?

732
00:31:51,956 --> 00:31:53,366
市长呗 他有这个特点
The mayor-- he has a tell.

733
00:31:53,366 --> 00:31:55,916
每次他在忽悠的你时候 总会挠挠后脑勺
He scratches the back of his head when he's bluffing.

734
00:31:55,926 --> 00:31:58,086
我们玩牌的时候发现他这个毛病 果断飞掉他
Picked it up in a poker game-- cleaned him out.

735
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:01,296
- 很高兴有所了解 - 嗯哼
- That's good to know. - Mm-hmm.

736
00:32:01,296 --> 00:32:04,096
他是个政客 所以他头都被挠破了吧
He's a politician, he must do a lot of scratching.

737
00:32:06,096 --> 00:32:08,516
你跟神奇的格蕾丝见过了 小子
Is it true you drew Amazing Grace, kid?

738
00:32:08,516 --> 00:32:10,136
谁是神奇的格蕾丝
Who's Amazing Grace?

739
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:12,136
局里的心理医生
The department shrink.

740
00:32:12,136 --> 00:32:13,756
意思是说他疯了么
Does that mean he's crazy?

741
00:32:13,756 --> 00:32:15,856
不是 机灵鬼 不是说他疯了
No, Wisenheimer, it doesn't mean he's crazy.

742
00:32:15,856 --> 00:32:18,056
警局的制度 开枪之后 你必须得去
It's department policy-- after a shooting, you have to go.

743
00:32:18,066 --> 00:32:19,446
没办法
You got no choice.

744
00:32:19,446 --> 00:32:21,866
不是说去见心理医生 就说明你疯了
Well, not that seeing a shrink means you're crazy.

745
00:32:21,866 --> 00:32:24,236
我在位时 可没有这套
My day, there was no department shrink.

746
00:32:24,236 --> 00:32:27,066
是啊 那时候都自己扛过去直到崩溃
Yeah, guys bottled it up until they stroked out.

747
00:32:27,066 --> 00:32:30,456
啊 还是原来好啊
Ah, the good old days.

748

我跟你 你应该逮捕泰勒的
I told you, you should've arrested Tyler.

749
00:32:37,216 --> 00:32:38,546
是啊 你得
Yeah, well, and you need

750
00:32:38,546 --> 00:32:40,176
在你崩溃之前放下包袱
to learn to let things go before you stroke out.

751
00:32:40,176 --> 00:32:41,626
泰勒在这儿在做啥呢
Do we know what Tyler's doing here?

752
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,786
非法入侵 这只是个开始
Trespassing, for starters.

753
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,046
喂 喂 慢着 你在这呆着
Whoa, whoa, whoa-- you hang back

754
00:32:46,046 --> 00:32:47,376
我看看他到底在搞什么鬼
till I find out what's going on with Tyler.

755
00:32:47,376 --> 00:32:48,676
啥 你叫我在这里等
What-- you expect me to wait in the car?

756
00:32:48,686 --> 00:32:49,966
我会敲碎窗户给你信号
I'll crack the window for you.

757
00:32:49,966 --> 00:32:51,096
听着 你就不该来这
Look, kid, you shouldn't even be here.

758
00:32:51,096 --> 00:32:52,336
我才是那个需要答案的人
I'm the one who needs answers.

759
00:32:52,336 --> 00:32:53,996
我帮你找 行么 相信我
And I'm gonna get them for you, trust me.

760

我要进去
I'm coming in.

761
00:32:56,436 --> 00:32:58,026
随你便吧
Suit yourself.

762
00:33:00,276 --> 00:33:02,606
我们几个人进去把招聘会遣散了
Hey. A few of us came in to tear down the Job Fair.

763
00:33:02,616 --> 00:33:04,616
泰勒来了 表现非常怪异
Tyler showed up, acting... pretty bizarre.

764
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:06,226
是么 他身上有武器么
Yeah? He got any weapons on him?

765
00:33:06,236 --> 00:33:08,396
据我所知没有 不过他肯定是嗑药了
Not that I know of, but he's definitely high.

766
00:33:08,396 --> 00:33:09,686
听我说 他是个好人
Look, he-he's a good guy.

767
00:33:09,686 --> 00:33:11,036
不管那天你跟他说了啥
Whatever went down with you the other day

768
00:33:11,036 --> 00:33:12,156
- 肯定是导火索 - 好的
- must've set him off.- All right.

769
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,116
我们会处理好的
We'll take care of it, okay?

770
00:33:13,126 --> 00:33:14,856
你先别进来了
We need you to stay out here.

771
00:33:19,746 --> 00:33:20,966

Tyler?

772
00:33:22,416 --> 00:33:23,626
抱歉
Sorry.

我们不会伤害你的
We ain't gonna hurt you.

你嗑了什么 泰勒 
What are you on, Tyler?

776
00:33:31,086 --> 00:33:32,706

Everything.

I just, I just want it to stop. I-I want him to stop.

778
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:37,596
我想让他停下 但他死活不停 就是不停
I want him to stop, but he won't, he won't stop!

Don't get yourself in trouble.

786
00:33:53,366 --> 00:33:54,916
他为啥想自杀
Why did he want to kill himself?

787
00:33:56,566 --> 00:33:57,566
你是谁
Who are you?

788
00:33:57,566 --> 00:33:59,396
我是吉米・雷根警官
I'm Officer Jamie Reagan.

789
00:33:59,406 --> 00:34:01,586
就是你杀了盖文

你还是说说为啥他这么做吧 
Why don't you tell us why he did it, okay?

792
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,766
我只想让他为他所做的付出代价
I just wanted him to pay for what he did.

793
00:34:10,766 --> 00:34:12,246
他不应该死的
He wasn't supposed to die.

794
00:34:12,246 --> 00:34:13,516
他做了啥 
What did he do?

795
00:34:15,916 --> 00:34:17,246
他做了什么 泰勒
What did he do, Tyler?

796
00:34:22,426 --> 00:34:24,556
放松点
Take it easy.

797
00:34:27,726 --> 00:34:28,946
把你的手从兜里拿出来
Get your hand out of your pocket.

798

嘿 把你的手从兜里拿出来

叫救护车
Call an ambulance!

801
00:34:39,876 --> 00:34:42,376
不 你不能死在这里
No, don't you die on me!

802
00:34:49,936 --> 00:34:51,506
在我传评审团进来之前
Before I have them bring the jury in,

803
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:52,706
还有任何其他的申请么
are there any applications?

804
00:34:53,218 --> 00:34:55,338
请问法官大人对
Is the judge's offer

805
00:34:55,338 --> 00:34:56,838
认罪的最长刑期提议是否有效
for the top count plea still open?

806
00:34:56,838 --> 00:34:58,538
什么
What?

807
00:34:58,538 --> 00:35:00,538
如果被告认罪接受
If the defendant would plead out

808
00:35:00,538 --> 00:35:02,878
本次指控的最长刑期
at the top count of the indictment,

809
00:35:02,878 --> 00:35:04,508
鉴于这是他的初犯
this being his first offense,

810
00:35:04,518 --> 00:35:05,928
我仍然倾向于
I would still be inclined

811
00:35:05,928 --> 00:35:07,548
建议对其判一至三年
to recommend a sentence of one to three.

812
00:35:07,548 --> 00:35:08,768
与此同时
Then, at this time,

813
00:35:08,768 --> 00:35:10,018
被告会承认
the defendant would like to plead guilty

814
00:35:10,018 --> 00:35:11,848
三级重大窃盗罪
to grand larceny in the third degree.

815
00:35:11,858 --> 00:35:13,058
为什么
Why?

816
00:35:13,888 --> 00:35:15,518
有问题吗 雷根女士
Is there a problem, Ms. Reagan?

817
00:35:17,608 --> 00:35:20,308
没有 我只是很意外
No, I'm just... surprised.

818
00:35:20,308 --> 00:35:23,198
市长还在外面等候接受盘问
I have the mayor outside waiting to be crossed.

819
00:35:23,198 --> 00:35:25,868
我们很不愿意麻烦
Well, much as we hate to inconvenience

820
00:35:25,868 --> 00:35:27,118
市长阁下
His Majesty the Mayor,

821
00:35:27,118 --> 00:35:29,318
被告会承认
the defendant is pleading guilty

822
00:35:29,318 --> 00:35:30,788
你对他的控告
to charges you brought against him.

823
00:35:30,788 --> 00:35:32,738
这就是判决 雷根女士
It's a conviction, Ms. Reagan.

824
00:35:32,738 --> 00:35:34,688
接受吧
Take it.

825
00:35:36,198 --> 00:35:37,378
被告现在将起立
The defendant will now stand

826
00:35:37,378 --> 00:35:40,498
宣读对他的待定指控
and allocute to the pending charges against him.

827
00:35:41,798 --> 00:35:43,838
你们俩碰巧就碰上了
So the two of you just happened to end up

828
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:45,498
一个你们觉得和这案子
with a guy you felt was connected

829
00:35:45,508 --> 00:35:47,308
相关的人
to the case.

830
00:35:47,308 --> 00:35:48,888
这几率能有多大
What are the odds?

831
00:35:48,888 --> 00:35:52,308
丹尼 你看上去一直都能遇事摆平的
Danny, you always seem to land on your feet.

832
00:35:52,308 --> 00:35:54,208
但有一天你可能就摆不平了
But someday you won't,

833
00:35:54,208 --> 00:35:55,758
我也帮不了你
and I won't be able to help.

834
00:35:55,768 --> 00:35:57,478
至少我不该帮你
At least, I shouldn't.

835
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,728
我明白
I understand.

836
00:35:58,738 --> 00:36:02,148
我会为我的搭档把这种事解决
I would see this thing through for a partner,

837
00:36:02,158 --> 00:36:04,988
我当然会为我弟弟解决
I damn well gotta see it through for my kid brother.

838
00:36:04,988 --> 00:36:07,888
作为你的上司 我命令你要听从你的父亲
And as your boss, I'm ordering you to listen to your father.

839
00:36:09,328 --> 00:36:10,328
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

840
00:36:10,328 --> 00:36:12,748
再也别去逞能了
No more going off the grid.

841
00:36:12,748 --> 00:36:13,998
不过 既然我做了
Though, now that I did,

842
00:36:13,998 --> 00:36:16,748
我偶然发现这个人和我跟的案子有关
I stumbled upon the guy who is legitimately my case.

843
00:36:16,748 --> 00:36:19,788
到底是什么样的案子
And what case is that, exactly?

844
00:36:19,788 --> 00:36:22,168
要弄清盖文到底怎么了 泰勒是关键
Tyler is the key to finding out what happened to Gavin.

845
00:36:22,178 --> 00:36:24,628
吉米应该知道这个人到底要说什么
Jamie deserves to hear what this guy's got to say.

846
00:36:24,628 --> 00:36:26,548
泰勒怎么样
What's Tyler's condition?

847
00:36:26,548 --> 00:36:29,468
很稳定 不过他打了镇静剂 我不能跟他说话
He's stable, but he's sedated, so I can't talk to him.

848
00:36:29,468 --> 00:36:31,518
你在想什么
So what are you thinking?

849
00:36:31,518 --> 00:36:33,548
我在想泰勒和盖文读大学的时候
I'm thinking that something pretty heavy went down

850
00:36:33,548 --> 00:36:35,548
肯定发生过大事
with Tyler and Gavin when they were back in college.

851
00:36:35,558 --> 00:36:37,518
我就打电话给剑桥警方
So I put in a call to Cambridge PD

852
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,778
想查查发生在那个时候的悬案
to look into some cold cases from back then.

853
00:36:41,608 --> 00:36:43,058
我想
I suppose...

854
00:36:43,058 --> 00:36:45,308
我们能给泰勒
we could get Tyler on menacing

855
00:36:45,318 --> 00:36:47,528
定个恐吓和非法携带武器罪
and criminal possession of a weapon.

856
00:36:48,948 --> 00:36:51,038
这些作用都不大
There's not a lot of leverage in that.

857
00:36:51,038 --> 00:36:52,288
如果碰上个接洽的法官的话
Well, with the right judge,

858
00:36:52,288 --> 00:36:53,658
也许能帮你弄到张搜查令
maybe you can get a search warrant.

859
00:36:53,658 --> 00:36:57,608
那要让接洽的人打电话给接洽的法官
If the right person calls the right judge.

860
00:37:00,158 --> 00:37:03,218
一个字都别和局长提
Not a word of this to the commissioner.

861
00:37:06,968 --> 00:37:08,968
艾琳
Erin!

862
00:37:08,968 --> 00:37:11,168
你还没走啊
You're still here.

863
00:37:11,178 --> 00:37:13,338
我干嘛要走
Why wouldn't I be?

864
00:37:13,338 --> 00:37:14,338
怎么了
What happened?

865
00:37:14,348 --> 00:37:15,508
别告诉我审讯还没结束
Don't tell me the trial was continued.

866
00:37:15,508 --> 00:37:17,008
审讯结束了
No, the trial's over.

867
00:37:17,008 --> 00:37:17,898
莱恩认罪了
Ryan pled out.

868
00:37:17,898 --> 00:37:19,568
就是说我们赢了
So we won.

869
00:37:19,568 --> 00:37:22,068
没错 对你来说可是双赢啊
Yeah, that's a win-win for you.

870
00:37:24,898 --> 00:37:26,108
等我一下
Give me a second.

871
00:37:26,108 --> 00:37:27,238
艾琳 我不大懂
Erin, I'm not quite sure

872
00:37:27,238 --> 00:37:28,518
你的意思
what that's supposed to mean.

873
00:37:28,528 --> 00:37:30,308
我不明白为什么斯科尼克
I don't know why Skolnick

874
00:37:30,308 --> 00:37:32,238
要在周五那么扬言叫嚣而
would make the claims that he did on Friday

875
00:37:32,248 --> 00:37:34,278
今天却急转直下认栽了
and then turn around and fall on his sword today.

876
00:37:34,278 --> 00:37:36,308
原因我告诉过你的  没有无罪开脱证据
Well, I told you: because there was no exculpatory evidence.

877
00:37:36,318 --> 00:37:37,528
他在虚张声势
He was bluffing.

878
00:37:37,538 --> 00:37:40,488
我觉得上周末在我不知情的情况下
I think there was a backroom deal made over the weekend

879
00:37:40,488 --> 00:37:41,998
有过秘密交易
that I'm not privy to.

880
00:37:42,008 --> 00:37:45,488
艾琳 你说的这些我都不知道
Erin, none that I had any knowledge of.

881
00:37:45,488 --> 00:37:48,008
你向我保证过 我什么都不用担心
You promised me that I had nothing to worry about,

882
00:37:48,008 --> 00:37:50,378
所有的制裁威胁
and all the sanction threats that he made

883
00:37:50,378 --> 00:37:52,598
就这么神奇地消失了
just magically disappeared.

884
00:37:52,598 --> 00:37:53,968
好吧
Okay.

885
00:37:53,968 --> 00:37:54,968
你就问我吧
Go ahead and ask me.

886
00:37:54,968 --> 00:37:56,298
问你什么
Ask you what?

887
00:37:56,298 --> 00:37:57,548
他们有没有
If there is anything to

888
00:37:57,558 --> 00:37:59,048
中伤过我
the mud they were flinging at me.

889
00:38:01,688 --> 00:38:05,028
我是这所法院的助理检察官
I am an officer of this court.

890
00:38:05,028 --> 00:38:07,028
如果有人宣誓后做伪证
If there were any lies told under oath,

891
00:38:07,028 --> 00:38:08,778
我有义务向上汇报
I am obligated to report them.

892
00:38:08,778 --> 00:38:10,118
问吧
Ask.

893
00:38:12,948 --> 00:38:14,518
有吗
Were there?

894
00:38:16,068 --> 00:38:17,458
没有
No.

895
00:38:21,798 --> 00:38:24,908
那就好
Good.

896
00:38:45,318 --> 00:38:47,098
你好像玩的很开心啊
You look like you're having fun.

897
00:38:47,098 --> 00:38:48,488
才没有 告诉我有好事了
No, but tell me I'm about to.

898
00:38:48,488 --> 00:38:50,158
你执行泰勒的搜查令了
You executed Tyler's search warrant?

899
00:38:50,158 --> 00:38:51,938
是啊
I did.

900
00:38:53,888 --> 00:38:56,078
你怎么了 说话大喘气
What's with you and the dramatic pauses?

901
00:38:56,078 --> 00:38:57,828
你抓的那个泰勒
Your guy Tyler was the recipient

902
00:38:57,828 --> 00:38:59,278
接受的盖文・布莱恩特的遗书
of Gavin Bryant's suicide note.

903
00:39:00,828 --> 00:39:02,838
盖文自杀后还留言了吗
Gavin left a suicide note?

904
00:39:02,838 --> 00:39:04,568
有意思 上面写什么了
Well, that's beautiful. What'd it say?

905
00:39:04,568 --> 00:39:06,068
你查的这些悬案里面
In your cold case files here,

906
00:39:06,068 --> 00:39:08,408
有查到一个叫安娜的人吗
you find anything involving someone named Anna?

907
00:39:08,408 --> 00:39:10,038
安娜 
Anna. Uh...

908
00:39:10,038 --> 00:39:12,708
好像有个强奸案和凶杀案里有
Maybe one in rape and one in homicide.

909
00:39:12,708 --> 00:39:13,958
怎么了 遗书写什么了
Why? What does the note say?

910
00:39:13,958 --> 00:39:15,848
你自己看吧
Read it for yourself.

911
00:39:18,688 --> 00:39:21,598
泰勒 你说的没错
"Tyler, you were right.

912
00:39:21,608 --> 00:39:23,558
我要为自己的行为付出代价 但是我不能承受
"I have to pay for what I did, but I can't face

913
00:39:23,558 --> 00:39:24,688
你给我选择的惩罚
the punishment you have chosen for me."

914
00:39:24,688 --> 00:39:27,528
你给他选择了什么惩罚
What punishment did you choose for him?

915
00:39:27,528 --> 00:39:28,808
坐牢
Prison.

916
00:39:28,808 --> 00:39:31,678
我告诉他如果我不自首 我就告发他
Told him if he didn't turn himself in, I would.

917
00:39:33,868 --> 00:39:36,738
安娜当年只比我女儿现在大几岁
"Anna was just a few years older than my own daughter is now.

918
00:39:36,738 --> 00:39:38,198
我夺走了她的生命
"I took her life...

919
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:40,118
我选择结束自己的生命作为交换
I choose to take my own in return."

920
00:39:41,518 --> 00:39:43,488
安娜・珀塞尔
Anna Purcell.

921
00:39:43,488 --> 00:39:44,778
15年前死于一场
Young girl killed in a hit-and-run

922
00:39:44,778 --> 00:39:46,958
肇事逃逸
15 years ago.

923
00:39:47,908 --> 00:39:49,378
肇事的是你和盖文吗
This was you and Gavin?

924
00:39:50,668 --> 00:39:52,888
当时我们都磕嗨了
We were both high.

925
00:39:53,798 --> 00:39:57,218
盖文坚持要开车
Gavin insisted on driving.

926
00:40:00,138 --> 00:40:01,678
他撞的她
He hit her.

927
00:40:01,678 --> 00:40:04,178
拖着她开了两趟街 都没停过
Dragged her two blocks, didn't even stop.

928
00:40:06,018 --> 00:40:07,818
当时你怎么不告发他
Why didn't you turn him in then?

929
00:40:10,238 --> 00:40:11,648
他是我的朋友
He was my friend.

930
00:40:11,658 --> 00:40:14,018
他跟我说他宁愿死也不进监狱
He told me he'd rather die than go to prison.

931
00:40:14,018 --> 00:40:15,938
那你就什么措施都未采取
So instead, you did nothing.

932
00:40:15,938 --> 00:40:17,828
看看你的报应
And look how it turned out for you.

933
00:40:17,828 --> 00:40:19,578
它毁了我的生活
It ruined my life.

934
00:40:19,578 --> 00:40:21,148
它毁了很多人的生活
It ruined a lot of lives.

935
00:40:21,148 --> 00:40:23,368
盖文却春风得意了
Gavin's turned out perfectly.

936
00:40:23,368 --> 00:40:24,948
这不公平
It wasn't fair.

937
00:40:24,948 --> 00:40:26,818
我有把枪
"I have a gun.

938
00:40:26,818 --> 00:40:29,118
我会去个我家人找不到我的地方自杀
"I'll go somewhere my family won't find my body.

939
00:40:29,118 --> 00:40:31,538
希望我有勇气自杀成功
"I pray I have the nerve to carry it out.

940
00:40:31,538 --> 00:40:34,008
如果我还是太懦弱 杀不了自己
"If I turn out to be a coward in this as well,

941
00:40:34,008 --> 00:40:35,788
我发誓会找个替代方法结束生命
I promise I'll find an alternative."

942
00:40:35,798 --> 00:40:39,128
盖文找到替代方法了
Well, Gavin found his alternative, all right.

943
00:40:39,968 --> 00:40:42,268
他的替代方法就是让我杀他
Yeah, his alternative was me.

944
00:40:54,178 --> 00:40:56,368
我们把遗书读给他听
So we read him the suicide note

945
00:40:56,368 --> 00:40:57,818
他就交待了
and he opened up about it.

946
00:40:57,818 --> 00:40:58,818
没错
Yep.

947
00:40:58,818 --> 00:41:00,488
吉米费了好大的精力
Though Jamie did a hell of a job

948
00:41:00,488 --> 00:41:02,288
一个人把那些碎片拼起来了
putting the pieces together all by himself.

949
00:41:04,118 --> 00:41:05,818
百分之十
Ten percent.

950
00:41:05,828 --> 00:41:07,408
什么百分之十
What's 10%?

951
00:41:07,408 --> 00:41:10,628
吉米想知道有多少警察在执勤的时候开枪
Jamie wanted to know how many cops who fired their weapon

952
00:41:10,628 --> 00:41:13,168
弄出人命的
in the line of duty had a fatal result.

953
00:41:13,168 --> 00:41:14,198
哦
Oh...

954
00:41:14,198 --> 00:41:15,368
这个百分之十
Ten percent.

955
00:41:15,368 --> 00:41:18,198
- 百分之五中的百分之十  - 没错  
- 10% of the 5%.  - Yep.

956
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:20,388
他们中的三个就在这儿坐着
And three of them are sitting right here.

957
00:41:20,388 --> 00:41:22,538
这样的几率有多大
What are the odds of that?

958
00:41:23,708 --> 00:41:26,398
这个圈子谁都不想进来
It's not a club anyone asks to join.

959
00:41:26,398 --> 00:41:28,678
没错 但我们都在这儿
Nope, but here we are.

960
00:41:28,678 --> 00:41:30,228
这说明什么
What does that say about us?

961
00:41:31,738 --> 00:41:35,018
也许是当本能意识到要逃离火源的时候
Maybe when basic instinct says to run away from a fire,

962
00:41:35,018 --> 00:41:36,548
有些人反而会跑向火
a few run towards it.

963
00:41:39,488 --> 00:41:40,988
如果他受挫折
"If he fails,

964
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,058
至少是尽其勇
"he at least fails daring greatly,

965
00:41:43,058 --> 00:41:44,258
