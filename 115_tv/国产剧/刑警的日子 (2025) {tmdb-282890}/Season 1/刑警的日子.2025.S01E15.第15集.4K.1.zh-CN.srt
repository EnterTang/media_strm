&lt;i>埃尔西诺高速公路交通陷入停滞。&lt;/i>
<i>Traffic is at a standstill
on the Elsinore motorway.</i>

4
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:52,441
&lt;i>紧急车辆已出动。
请让他们过去。&lt;/i>
<i>Emergency vehicles have been dispatched.
Please let them through.</i>

5
00:00:52,601 --> 00:00:55,121
&lt;i>我们还不知道原因。&lt;/i>
<i>We don't know the cause yet.</i>

6
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:41,961
对伊丽莎白来说，“爱你的邻居”
不只是一句话。
To Elisabeth, "love thy neighbour"
was not just a phrase.

7
00:01:43,161 --> 00:01:45,401
这是一种处世之道。
It was a way of being in the world.

8
00:01:45,561 --> 00:01:52,241
一种当牧师的方式。
一种当妻子和母亲的方式。
A way to be a pastor.
And a way to be a wife and a mother.

9
00:01:55,401 --> 00:01:58,921
你对她来说意味着一切。
You meant everything to her.

10
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:16,201
抱歉。请让我来做。
Sorry. Please let me do it.

11
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:57,161
现在有什么事吗？
比如咖啡？
Will there be something now?
Like coffee?

12
00:03:22,081 --> 00:03:27,041
你好，Regitze。
我们能一起做这件事真是太好了。
Hello, Regitze.
Great that we could do this together.

13
00:03:27,201 --> 00:03:32,721
牧师住宅是官方住所。
新牧师很不耐烦。
Parsonages are official residences.
The new pastor is impatient.

14
00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:36,881
我试过几次给 Jan 打电话，
但我不确定他是否开始收拾行李了。
I've tried to call Jan several times,
but I'm not sure he started packing.

15
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,081
他没有认真对待这件事。
He's not taking this seriously.

16
00:03:39,241 --> 00:03:44,601
牧师住宅是正式的住所。
新牧师必须搬进来。
A parsonage is an official residence.
The new pastor has to move in.

17
00:03:44,761 --> 00:03:49,281
简，我们理解你的悲伤，
你的震惊，但生活还得继续。
Jan, we understand your grief,
your shock, but life must go on.

18
00:03:49,441 --> 00:03:51,721
生活还有很多事情要做。
Life still has a lot to give.

19
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:55,601
我有一本小书给你，
&lt;i>掌握悲伤&lt;/i>。
I have a little book for you,
<i>Mastering Grief.</i>

20
00:03:55,761 --> 00:03:59,441
- 简……
- 胡说八道。
- Jan...
- What nonsense.

21
00:03:59,601 --> 00:04:02,481
愚蠢的混蛋！
Stupid wanker!

22
00:04:03,841 --> 00:04:05,841
爸爸！
Dad!

23
00:04:07,761 --> 00:04:12,921
快……快出来。
海涅现在已经离开了。
Just... just come out.
Heine has left now.

24
00:04:19,641 --> 00:04:22,481
太好了。
Great.

25
00:04:23,961 --> 00:04:26,921
那么，我去煮点咖啡。
So, I'll make some coffee.

26
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:29,881
我们需要打开一些东西。
There is something we need to open.

27
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:40,521
我的竖琴变成了哀悼，
我的笛子变成了哭泣者的声音。
My harp is turned to mourning and
my flute to the sound of those who weep.

28
00:04:49,241 --> 00:04:54,201
我们必须打开它。我们两个。
现在她已经不在了。
We have to open this. The two of us.
Now that she is no longer here.

29
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:58,081
这就是我被告知的。
That's what I was told.

30
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:20,841
&lt;i>亲爱的你们。&lt;/i>
<i>Dear you.</i>

31
00:05:21,001 --> 00:05:25,121
&lt;i>我最亲爱的你们两个。&lt;/i>
<i>My dearest you two.</i>

32
00:05:25,281 --> 00:05:28,441
&lt;i>我站在天堂之门前。&lt;/i>
<i>I stand before the pearly gates.</i>

33
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:33,161
&lt;i>其实我在床上，
但你们知道我的意思。&lt;/i>
<i>I'm in my bed, actually,
but you know what I mean.</i>

34
00:05:33,321 --> 00:05:39,801
&lt;i>我很平静。我的信仰与我同在。
我唯一的悲伤和担忧就是你。&lt;/i>
<i>I'm calm. My faith is with me.
My only sorrow and worry is you.</i>

35
00:05:43,641 --> 00:05:48,281
&lt;i>当你是一个家庭时，
尤其是像我们这么小的家庭 - &lt;/i>
<i>When you are a family,
especially one as small as ours - </i>

36
00:05:48,441 --> 00:05:52,481
&lt;i>你们必须努力工作
才能互相支持 - &lt;/i>
<i>you must work hard
to be there for each other - </i>

37
00:05:52,641 --> 00:05:57,401
&lt;i>无论存在什么差异
和分歧。&lt;/i>
<i>regardless of differences
and disagreements.</i>

38
00:05:57,561 --> 00:06:04,081
&lt;i>Regitze，Jan 是你的父亲。记仇或断绝关系是没有用的。&lt;/i>
<i>Regitze, Jan is your father. It's no use
holding a grudge or cutting him off.</i>

39
00:06:04,241 --> 00:06:07,041
&lt;i>他是你唯一的父亲。&lt;/i>
<i>He's the only father you've got.</i>

40
00:06:08,521 --> 00:06:12,081
&lt;i>简，她是你唯一的女儿。
振作起来。&lt;/i>
<i>Jan, she's your only daughter.
Pull yourself together.</i>

41
00:06:12,241 --> 00:06:15,201
&lt;i>即使你不得不放下你的骄傲。&lt;/i>
<i>Even if you have to swallow your pride.</i>

42
00:06:15,361 --> 00:06:19,721
&lt;i>有时你必须走很远才能和对方达成共识。&lt;/i>
<i>Sometimes you have to go a long way
to meet each other halfway.</i>

43
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:26,001
&lt;i>Regitze，你父亲和我谈到了步行卡米诺 - &lt;/i>
<i>Regitze, your father and I talked
about walking the Camino - </i>

44
00:06:26,161 --> 00:06:30,881
&lt;i>从阿斯托加到孔波斯特拉大教堂。&lt;/i>
<i>from Astorga to the cathedral
in Compostela.</i>

45
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:37,201
&lt;i>这是我一生的梦想。
我做不到。&lt;/i>
<i>It was a lifelong dream of mine.
I won't make it.</i>

46
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:45,601
&lt;i>所以这是我最后的愿望：
希望你们俩能一起走上卡米诺之路。&lt;/i>
<i>So this is my final wish:
that you two walk the Camino together.</i>

47
00:06:46,721 --> 00:06:50,481
&lt;i>我相信这对你们有好处。&lt;/i>
<i>I believe it will do you good.</i>

48
00:06:50,641 --> 00:06:54,241
&lt;i>照顾好自己，照顾好彼此。&lt;/i>
<i>Take care of yourselves, and each other.</i>

49
00:07:09,761 --> 00:07:15,481
- 卡米诺之路？
- 是的，卡米诺之路。
- The Camino?
- Yes, the Camino.

50
00:07:15,641 --> 00:07:20,441
- 260 公里。
- 好的。
- 260 kilometers.
- Okay.

51
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:23,521
需要 11 天。
It'll take 11 days.

52
00:07:25,121 --> 00:07:27,321
11 天？
11 days?

53
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:36,841
也许有更短的路线？
周末？
Maybe there's a shorter route?
Over a weekend?

54
00:07:41,321 --> 00:07:44,881
你一点都不想念她吗？
Don't you miss her at all?

55
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:52,121
我想念她吗？
她是我的母亲，我当然想念她。
Do I miss her?
She is my mother, of course I miss her.

56
00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:58,121
那么也许你会考虑
尊重她的遗愿。
Then perhaps you'll consider
respecting her last wish.

57
00:08:16,081 --> 00:08:18,841
你们俩打算做什么？
What are you two going to do?

58
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:24,321
我真的不知道。你知道情况是怎样的。
I don't really know. You know how it is.

59
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:35,441
如果你们继续徒步旅行，你们俩终于可以交谈了。
You two could finally talk,
if you go on that hike.

60
00:08:37,241 --> 00:08:38,921
对。
Right.

61
00:08:46,561 --> 00:08:50,601
- 她埋在哪里？
- 公墓。
- Where's she buried?
- Common grave.

62
00:09:10,961 --> 00:09:13,161
嘿！
Hey!

63
00:09:13,321 --> 00:09:19,641
- 不要把花扔在那里。
- 我妈妈的骨灰盒刚刚放在这里。
- Don't dump your flowers there.
- My mom's urn was just put down here.

64
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:26,561
那只是一片草坪。公墓
在那边的桦树林旁边。
That's just a lawn. The common grave
is over there by the birch grove.

65
00:09:26,721 --> 00:09:30,281
好的。给你。
Okay. Here you go.

66
00:09:34,281 --> 00:09:39,801
- 和他一起旅行会很漫长。
- 你的情况怎么样？
- It's going to be a long trip with him.
- How about your situation?

67
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:44,641
- 你和那个荷兰人谈过吗？
- 你觉得这太热了吗？
- Have you talked with the Dutch guy?
- Do you think this is too warm?

68
00:09:47,001 --> 00:09:50,241
我明白
这可能会让人不知所措。
I understand
that it can be overwhelming.

69
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:54,441
- 但你和他谈过吗？
- 我还没来得及。
- But have you talked to him?
- I haven't gotten around to it.

70
00:09:57,641 --> 00:10:00,681
又是我爸爸吗？
Is it my father again?

71
00:10:00,841 --> 00:10:04,721
现在是关于背包里的一块石头的事情。
Now it's something about a stone
in the backpack.

72
00:10:09,161 --> 00:10:13,561
一开始他从不发短信。
现在他一直发短信。
First he never texts.
Now it never stops.

73
00:10:13,721 --> 00:10:16,961
现在是关于石头的事情？
And now something about a stone?

74
00:10:26,441 --> 00:10:31,281
我想你妈妈现在见到我们会很高兴。
I think it would really
please your mother to see us now.

75
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:37,521
那里的美食很棒。
It's a great cuisine down there.

76
00:10:37,681 --> 00:10:41,561
我期待着
品尝 caldeirada。
I'm looking forward
to tasting caldeirada.

77
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:48,961
- 这次旅行不是为了吃。
- 对。
- This trip is not about eating.
- Right.

78
00:11:26,601 --> 00:11:30,241
- 那是什么？
- 你的 Camino Pass。
- What's that?
- Your Camino Pass.

79
00:11:33,081 --> 00:11:36,121
- 我是 Joaquín。你叫什么名字？
- 我叫 Jan。
- I'm Joaquín. What's your name?
- My name is Jan.

80
00:11:36,281 --> 00:11:39,521
- 欢迎，Jan。这是你的第一次 Camino 之旅？
- 是的。
- Welcome, Jan. Your first Camino?
- Yes, it is.

81
00:11:39,681 --> 00:11:44,081
- 太棒了。&lt;i>Buen Camino！&lt;/i>
- 谢谢。
- Wonderful. <i>Buen Camino!</i>
- Thank you.

82
00:11:44,241 --> 00:11:47,041
请告诉我。我是 Joaquín。
Please. I'm Joaquín.

83
00:11:47,201 --> 00:11:49,681
- 请问您的名字？
- Regitze。
- Your name, please?
- Regitze.

84
00:11:49,841 --> 00:11:53,881
很高兴认识您。
这是您第一次走 Camino 吗？
Nice to meet you.
It's your first time Camino?

85
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:59,721
是的，我母亲刚刚死于癌症，
这是她的最后愿望。
Yeah, my mother just died of cancer,
and this was her last wish.

86
00:11:59,881 --> 00:12:02,561
太好了。&lt;i>Buen Camino！&lt;/i>
Great. <i>Buen Camino!</i>

87
00:12:05,761 --> 00:12:08,841
- 好了。
- “第一步。”
- There we go.
- "The first step."

88
00:12:09,001 --> 00:12:13,201
这是我和你母亲开始新事物时使用的表达方式。
That's an expression your mother and I
used when starting something new.

89
00:12:16,401 --> 00:12:21,561
- 我以前从未听说过。
- 好吧，我们听说过。我们说过。
- I've never heard that before.
- Well, we did. We said that.

90
00:12:21,721 --> 00:12:26,881
好的，没问题。
Okay, fine.

91
00:12:30,121 --> 00:12:33,481
- 第一步。
- 是的，第一步。
- The first step.
- The first step, yes.

92
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:38,281
第一天
还有 260 公里
DAY 1
260 kilometers to go

93
00:12:40,241 --> 00:12:43,081
谷歌说我们走得太远了！
Google says we've gone too far!

94
00:12:43,241 --> 00:12:48,961
第一张地图是在公元前 4,000 年在粘土上绘制的。它们仍然有效。
The first maps were drawn on clay
in 4,000 BC. They still work.

95
00:12:49,121 --> 00:12:52,601
看，我们必须回去
然后右转。
Look, we have to go back there
and then right.

96
00:12:52,761 --> 00:12:58,041
看，我们走得太远了。
我们必须回去然后右转。
Look, we walked too far.
We have to go back and then right.

97
00:12:59,841 --> 00:13:02,681
&lt;i>Buen Camino！&lt;/i>
<i>Buen Camino!</i>

98
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:12,441
- 有些人打车出城。
- 我们也可以这样做吗？
- Some people take a taxi out of town.
- We could do that too?

99
00:13:13,521 --> 00:13:17,241
想想看，自中世纪以来，朝圣者就一直来到这里。
To think that pilgrims have walked
here since the Middle Ages.

100
00:13:17,401 --> 00:13:21,521
1200 年的传统！
A 1200-year-old tradition!

101
00:13:22,641 --> 00:13:25,641
真的很神奇。
Really magical.

102
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:35,641
- 你没带很多东西？
- 我们在西班牙。
- You haven't brought a lot?
- We're in Spain.

103
00:13:35,801 --> 00:13:39,481
天气晴朗温暖。
It's sunny and warm.

104
00:13:39,641 --> 00:13:43,161
穿着网球鞋走260公里？
260 kilometers in those tennis shoes?

105
00:13:43,321 --> 00:13:46,481
我觉得你不明白
这次徒步到底是为了什么。
I don't think you understand
what this walk is all about.

106
00:13:46,641 --> 00:13:52,601
朝圣之路启迪并提升了朝圣者。别管穿什么鞋了。
The Camino enlightens and elevates
its pilgrims. Screw the footwear.

107
00:14:01,001 --> 00:14:07,161
如果你的母亲在这里，她会唱“赞美上帝创造的一切”。
If your mother was here, she'd sing
"Praise All Things That God Has Made".

108
00:14:07,321 --> 00:14:12,481
- 她的声音真好听。
- 你会让她安静下来。
- She had such a fine voice.
- You would have asked her to be quiet.

109
00:14:13,801 --> 00:14:16,761
你为什么这么说？
Why do you say that?

110
00:14:16,921 --> 00:14:21,481
因为每当她唱歌时你总是会这样。
Because you always did
whenever she sang.

111
00:14:21,641 --> 00:14:26,081
我没有！我们经常一起唱歌。
I did not! We often sang together.

112
00:14:35,001 --> 00:14:39,321
&lt;i>Buen Camino！&lt;/i>
<i>Buen Camino!</i>

113
00:14:39,481 --> 00:14:42,601
&lt;i>- Buen Camino。&lt;/i>
- 你好。
<i>- Buen Camino.</i>
- Hello.

114
00:14:44,921 --> 00:14:47,241
他哭了吗？
Did he cry?

115
00:14:47,401 --> 00:14:51,721
没关系，爸爸。我们只是记得不同而已。
It's okay, Dad.
We just remember things differently.

116
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:03,681
你们俩独处的时候
可能还唱过歌。
You probably sang
when you two were alone.

117
00:15:03,841 --> 00:15:06,761
我不知道。
I wouldn't know about that.

118
00:15:06,921 --> 00:15:10,921
&lt;i>Buen Camino。&lt;/i>
<i>Buen Camino.</i>

119
00:15:24,241 --> 00:15:29,601
嗯……我们还有
16 公里要走，对吧？
Well... we still have
16 kilometers to go, right?

120
00:15:56,641 --> 00:15:59,321
你需要休息一下吗？
Do you need a break?

121
00:16:13,281 --> 00:16:17,921
哦不！它们需要被挤破。
Oh no! They need to be popped.

122
00:16:18,081 --> 00:16:21,321
&lt;i>- Buen Camino！&lt;/i> 水泡？
- 是的，很大的水泡。
<i>- Buen Camino!</i> Blisters?
- Yeah, big ones.

123
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:25,881
- 我觉得你穿的鞋不对。
- 哦，你这么认为吗？
- I think you're wearing the wrong shoes.
- Oh, you think so?

124
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:30,041
是的，我认为你一定在那些东西上戳了个洞。
Yeah, and I think you must poke
a hole in those.

125
00:16:30,201 --> 00:16:33,521
- 是的，我刚告诉他。
- 我有这个。
- Yeah, I just told him.
- I have this one.

126
00:16:33,681 --> 00:16:37,361
- 我可以自己做。
- 不，不，不！没关系。
- I can do it myself.
- No, no, no! It's okay.

127
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:45,281
- 等等。
- 太好了，你什么都有！
- Hold on.
- Nice you have everything!

128
00:16:45,441 --> 00:16:47,561
好的...
Okay...

129
00:16:47,721 --> 00:16:50,161
好些了吗？
Better?

130
00:16:50,321 --> 00:16:53,241
- 谢谢！
- 我是 Mirna。我来自克罗地亚。
- Thank you!
- I'm Mirna. I'm from Croatia.

131
00:16:53,401 --> 00:16:58,361
我是 Jan，
我是来自丹麦的 Regitze。
This is Jan,
and I'm Regitze from Denmark.

132
00:16:58,521 --> 00:17:02,801
&lt;i>Buen Camino！&lt;/i> 再见。
<i>Buen Camino!</i> See you.

133
00:17:04,921 --> 00:17:08,481
- 她人真好。
- 她真是烦人。
- How nice of her.
- She was bloody annoying.

134
00:17:20,521 --> 00:17:23,601
- 你完成了吗？
- 是啊，是啊！
- Are you done yet?
- Yeah, yeah!

135
00:17:23,761 --> 00:17:26,961
- 快点。
- 嘿！
- Hurry up.
- Hey!

136
00:17:27,121 --> 00:17:29,641
- 挪威。
- 丹麦。
- Norway.
- Denmark.

137
00:17:29,801 --> 00:17:33,801
- 我来自奥斯陆。
- 哥本哈根。嗨。
- I'm from Oslo.
- Copenhagen. Hi.

138
00:17:33,961 --> 00:17:39,361
- 你一个人走朝圣之路？
- 我跟我爸爸一起走。是的。
- You're walking the Camino alone?
- I'm walking with my dad. Yeah.

139
00:17:40,841 --> 00:17:44,881
我本来应该跟
我的女朋友一起走的，但结果没成。
I was supposed to walk with
my girlfriend, but it didn't turn out.

140
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,601
Okay, sure.

141
00:17:47,761 --> 00:17:53,081
- 对。
- 不是那样的。
- Right.
- Didn't work that way.

142
00:17:53,241 --> 00:17:58,801
我们谈到了买房、买电动车、一起生孩子。
We talked about buying a house,
an electric car, having a child together.

143
00:17:58,961 --> 00:18:02,121
哦，哇。
Oh, wow.

144
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,161
是的。
Yeah.

145
00:18:06,081 --> 00:18:10,001
然后她爱上了
她的健身教练。
Then she fell in love
with her fitness trainer.

146
00:18:10,161 --> 00:18:13,241
哦，该死。
Oh, shit.

147
00:18:13,401 --> 00:18:18,121
她的巴西教练
从头到脚都纹身。
Her Brazilian trainer
tattooed from head to toe.

148
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:39,961
- 对不起。
- 没关系。
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

149
00:18:42,561 --> 00:18:45,521
只是……
It's just...

150
00:18:45,681 --> 00:18:50,321
- 纹身、健身、巴西。
- 太多了。
- Tattoos, fitness, Brazil.
- It's a lot.

151
00:18:52,081 --> 00:18:59,161
好吧，也许最好
想点别的。
Well, it's probably good
to think about something else.

152
00:19:00,921 --> 00:19:04,761
- 你的头发颜色和 Liv 一样。
- 哦，真有趣。
- You have the same hair color as Liv.
- Oh, that's funny.

153
00:19:04,921 --> 00:19:08,201
- 给我拿点卫生纸！
- 是的。抱歉。
- Bring me some toilet paper!
- Yeah. Sorry.

154
00:19:18,401 --> 00:19:22,241
- 嘿，哥本哈根！
- 嘿，奥斯陆。
- Hey, Copenhagen!
- Hey, Oslo.

155
00:19:25,321 --> 00:19:28,201
我会帮我们办理登机手续。
I'll check us in.

156
00:19:40,201 --> 00:19:44,921
你好！我刚才在想
你父亲和他的脚。
Hello again! I was just thinking
of your father and his feet.

157
00:19:45,081 --> 00:19:47,481
- 真的吗？太好了。
- 把这些带给你父亲。
- Oh, really? That's nice.
- Take these to your father.

158
00:19:47,641 --> 00:19:51,241
我是个脚很大的女人，
可以调整它们以适合他。
I'm a woman with big feet,
and they can be adjusted to fit him.

159
00:19:51,401 --> 00:19:55,481
- 不，我们不能带走它们。
- 是的，谢谢。我有靴子。
- No, we can't take them.
- Yes, please. I have my boots.

160
00:19:55,641 --> 00:19:57,721
- 真的吗？
- 一切都好！
- Really?
- All good!

161
00:19:57,881 --> 00:20:01,041
- 非常感谢！
- 是的。
- Thank you so much!
- Yes.

162
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:08,601
- 再见！
- 谢谢！
- Bye!
- Thank you!

163
00:20:12,241 --> 00:20:14,881
- 我们有房间了。
- 太棒了！你看。
- We've got a room.
- Great! And look.

164
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:18,401
Mirna 给了你她的凉鞋。
它们很完美。
Mirna gave you her sandals.
They're perfect.

165
00:20:18,561 --> 00:20:22,441
你妈妈讨厌男人
穿袜子穿凉鞋。
Your mother hated men
with socks in sandals.

166
00:20:24,561 --> 00:20:28,561
嗯，她现在不在这里。
Well, she's not here now.

167
00:20:31,121 --> 00:20:33,801
就拿去吧。
Just take them.

168
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:43,721
“谢谢，Mirna。谢谢，Gitze。
不用客气，爸爸。”
"Thanks, Mirna. Thanks, Gitze.
You're welcome, Dad."

169
00:20:46,721 --> 00:20:49,361
- 嗨。
- 嗨。
- Hi.
- Hi.

170
00:20:49,521 --> 00:20:53,801
好吧，我们聊了一会儿，但是……
Well, we're talking a little, but...

171
00:20:55,161 --> 00:20:59,401
&lt;i>关于什么？
你在说些什么真实的事情吗？&lt;/i>
<i>About anything?
Are you talking about anything real?</i>

172
00:21:02,081 --> 00:21:05,881
我真的在努力。
I'm really trying.

173
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:09,521
我不知道我是否想告诉他
我要当妈妈了。
I don't know if I want to tell him
I'm going to be a mother.

174
00:21:10,761 --> 00:21:13,881
&lt;i>我也会觉得很难
处在你的处境下。&lt;/i>
<i>I would also find it difficult
in your situation.</i>

175
00:21:15,121 --> 00:21:21,481
我的乳房真的很疼。
疼得要命。
My breasts are really sore.
It hurts like crazy.

176
00:21:21,641 --> 00:21:26,281
- 你一开始也有这种感觉吗？
&lt;i>- 没有，亨利。别再这样了。&lt;/i>
- Did you have that in the beginning too?
<i>- No, Henry. Stop that.</i>

177
00:21:26,441 --> 00:21:29,521
&lt;i>马德斯，请带他走。
不！&lt;/i>
<i>Mads, please take him.
No!</i>

178
00:21:29,681 --> 00:21:34,521
&lt;i>对不起。现在很疯狂。
我会给你回电话的。嘿！&lt;/i>
<i>I'm sorry. It's crazy right now.
I'll call you back. Hey!</i>

179
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:52,081
他们的贝类很好吃，
你不觉得吗？
Their shellfish is delicious,
don't you think?

180
00:21:54,961 --> 00:21:57,441
你小时候吃什么？
What did you eat as a child?

181
00:21:57,601 --> 00:22:00,601
为什么？
Why?

182
00:22:00,761 --> 00:22:06,521
我记不太清楚了。
我真的不记得奶奶了。
I just don't remember very well.
I don't really remember Grandma.

183
00:22:06,681 --> 00:22:09,801
这该死的汤里肯定没有多少贝类。
There sure aren't many shellfish
in this damn soup.

184
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:12,801
我确实记得爷爷。
I do remember Grandpa.

185
00:22:12,961 --> 00:22:18,001
他烟斗的味道和他低沉的声音
我以前很害怕。
The smell of his pipe and his deep voice
I used to be so scared of.

186
00:22:21,721 --> 00:22:24,881
他说话很多吗？
Did he talk a lot?

187
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:30,001
- 爷爷？
- 是的。你们相处得好吗？
- Grandpa?
- Yes. Did you get along?

188
00:22:30,161 --> 00:22:35,001
他最好被描述为
一个傲慢的混蛋。
He would best be described
as an arrogant asshole.

189
00:22:36,201 --> 00:22:40,641
- 还有别的吗？
- 我不想谈论他。
- And otherwise?
- I don't want to talk about him.

190
00:23:42,601 --> 00:23:45,921
- 早上好，哥本哈根。
- 早上好，奥斯陆。
- Good morning, Copenhagen.
- 'Morning, Oslo.

191
00:23:46,081 --> 00:23:49,841
20 公里徒步和瑜伽？
20-kilometer hike and yoga?

192
00:23:50,001 --> 00:23:54,401
这些床垫
对背部真的很硬。
Those mattresses
are really hard on the back.

193
00:24:09,001 --> 00:24:12,001
在朝圣之路上，控制自己的阴茎对你来说很合适。
It would suit you to control your dick
on the pilgrim's route.

194
00:24:12,161 --> 00:24:14,281
你垂涎的是我的女儿。
That's my daughter you're drooling over.

195
00:24:14,441 --> 00:24:17,921
她站在我面前。
我先来的。
She placed herself in front of me.
I was here first.

196
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:20,921
人们在这里寻求洞察力、安慰和智慧。
People are seeking insight,
comfort and wisdom here.

197
00:24:21,081 --> 00:24:24,601
你在做什么？
这家伙只顾着自己的事情。
What are you doing?
The guy was minding his own business.

198
00:24:24,761 --> 00:24:30,561
而你却在基督教朝圣之路上调情并信奉东方宗教。
And you flirt and practice an Eastern
religion on a Christian pilgrimage route.

199
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:33,641
放松。我正在伸展身体。
Relax. I'm stretching.

200
00:24:36,121 --> 00:24:38,801
而瑜伽不是宗教。
And yoga is not a religion.

201
00:25:25,601 --> 00:25:30,521
你今天的速度不错！
也许是上帝的速度。
You have a good speed today!
God's speed, maybe.

202
00:25:30,681 --> 00:25:34,841
凉鞋很完美。
非常感谢！
The sandals are perfect.
Thank you so much!

203
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:39,201
是吗，爸爸？
谢谢！
Right, Dad?
Thank you!

204
00:25:39,361 --> 00:25:41,521
- 你想和我一起去吗？
- 那会……
- You want to join me?
- That would...

205
00:25:41,681 --> 00:25:43,801
哦不，不，谢谢。
Oh no, no, thanks.

206
00:25:47,321 --> 00:25:51,601
那么改日再见。&lt;i>Buen Camino！&lt;/i>
Some other day then. <i>Buen Camino!</i>

207
00:25:56,881 --> 00:26:01,881
- 我们为什么不能和她一起走？
- 我来这里是为了你妈妈的遗愿。
- Why can't we walk with her?
- I'm here for your mother's last wish.

208
00:26:02,041 --> 00:26:08,161
不要和那些为情所困的大脚怪擦肩而过，他们以为这一切只是为了好玩。
Not to rub shoulders with some lovesick
Bigfoot who thinks it's all just for fun.

209
00:26:08,321 --> 00:26:11,361
第 4 天
DAY 4

210
00:26:11,521 --> 00:26:14,121
还有 145 公里
145 kilometers to go

211
00:26:29,761 --> 00:26:32,761
&lt;i>Cruz de Ferro&lt;/i>，铁十字勋章。
<i>Cruz de Ferro,</i> the Iron Cross.

212
00:26:32,921 --> 00:26:37,521
卡米诺的最高点。
这是一个非常重要的地方。
The highest point of the Camino.
It's a very important place.

213
00:26:37,681 --> 00:26:41,441
- 你可以把石头拿出来。
- 石头？
- You can take out the stone.
- The stone?

214
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:47,441
- 我发短信给你，让你带一块石头过来。
- 我以为是开玩笑。
- I texted you to bring a stone.
- I thought it was a joke.

215
00:26:47,601 --> 00:26:53,281
- 开玩笑？
- 嗯，我没听懂。
- A joke?
- Well, I didn't get it.

216
00:27:05,361 --> 00:27:10,081
这块石头代表着你想摆脱的负担。
The stone represents the burden
you want to free yourself from.

217
00:27:10,241 --> 00:27:16,761
通过放置这块石头，
你可以放下悲伤。
By placing this stone,
you put away your sorrows.

218
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:38,361
这可能只适用于
如果你是一个信徒。
It probably only works
if you're a believer.

219
00:27:41,281 --> 00:27:45,201
我不认为这是巧合
你没有石头就来了。
I don't think it's a coincidence
you came without a stone.

220
00:27:45,361 --> 00:27:49,961
- 你害怕真实的感受。
- 我不明白你的文字！
- You're afraid of real feelings.
- I didn't understand your text!

221
00:28:53,921 --> 00:28:57,961
让天下的水
聚集到一处。
Let the waters under the heaven
be gathered together unto one place.

222
00:28:58,121 --> 00:29:01,161
让干地露出来。
And let the dry land appear.

223
00:29:03,401 --> 00:29:06,441
上帝看着是好的。
And God saw that it was good.

224
00:29:11,641 --> 00:29:14,561
“创造。”
"The Creation."

225
00:29:14,721 --> 00:29:19,801
这就是你妈妈看到如此壮丽景色时说的话。
That's what your mother said
when she saw a stunning view like this.

226
00:29:23,601 --> 00:29:27,561
你知道我最喜欢的圣经故事是什么吗？
Do you know what my favorite story
from the Bible was?

227
00:29:28,961 --> 00:29:32,761
耶稣诞生的那一页。
The one where Jesus is born.

228
00:29:34,241 --> 00:29:37,361
- 圣诞福音？
- 是的。
- The Christmas Gospel?
- Yes.

229
00:29:37,521 --> 00:29:43,721
父母在家招待
一群客人。听起来很不错。
Mother and father at home with
a bunch of guests. Sounds very nice.

230
00:29:43,881 --> 00:29:47,361
这是对新约的资产阶级解读。
That's a rather bourgeois reading
of the New Testament.

231
00:29:47,521 --> 00:29:52,281
好吧，也许是。
Well, maybe it is.

232
00:29:52,441 --> 00:29:56,921
我嫉妒耶稣。
I was jealous of Jesus.

233
00:29:57,081 --> 00:30:02,601
想象一下，和你的父母以及动物一起住在那个马厩里。
Imagine living in that stable
with both your parents, and animals.

234
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:06,961
你在那个马厩里连两分钟都撑不住。
You wouldn't last
two minutes in that stable.

235
00:30:09,721 --> 00:30:11,961
&lt;i>- 加油！&lt;/i>
- 冷静下来！
<i>- Vamos!</i>
- Calm down!

236
00:30:12,121 --> 00:30:15,401
- 走开！
- 你在干什么？
- Go away!
- What are you doing?

237
00:30:15,561 --> 00:30:16,641
&lt;i>加油。加油。&lt;/i>
<i>Vamos. Vamos.</i>

238
00:30:16,801 --> 00:30:22,561
- 你怎么了？
- 身上有疥疮和跳蚤。
- What's wrong with you?
- It's got scabies and fleas.

239
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:27,201
如果我朝你扔石头怎么办？
What if I threw stones at you, huh?

240
00:30:27,361 --> 00:30:29,641
什么？
What?

241
00:30:29,801 --> 00:30:33,521
- 你不能朝任何人扔任何东西！
- 是的，我可以！
- You can't throw anything at anyone!
- Yes, I can!

242
00:30:33,681 --> 00:30:37,241
你害怕
任何形式的对抗。
You're afraid of
any kind of confrontation.

243
00:30:37,401 --> 00:30:42,441
- 你说什么？
- 你不喜欢挑战，Regitze。
- What did you say?
- You don't like challenges, Regitze.

244
00:30:42,601 --> 00:30:44,601
你只能避开他们。
You just avoid them.

245
00:30:46,801 --> 00:30:51,121
- 这是什么意思？
- 你从不坚持任何事情。
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You never stick with anything.

246
00:30:51,281 --> 00:30:57,281
兽医学、网球、烹饪
以及其他任何学科。
Veterinary studies, tennis, cooking
and whatever else there was.

247
00:30:58,761 --> 00:31:03,321
我没法上兽医学校。
你忘了我患有诵读困难症吗？
I couldn't handle veterinary school.
Did you forget I'm dyslexic?

248
00:31:03,481 --> 00:31:07,521
或者你只是不够坚韧。
Or maybe you just aren't tenacious.

249
00:31:07,681 --> 00:31:13,641
就像你忙于经营的那家高档餐饮公司一样。
Just like that fancy catering firm
you busied yourself with.

250
00:31:13,801 --> 00:31:18,361
听说过新冠疫情吗？
一切都关闭了，这不是我的错。
Ever heard about Covid?
It's not my fault everything closed.

251
00:31:22,841 --> 00:31:25,081
哎哟！
Ow!

252
00:31:25,241 --> 00:31:28,281
当生活艰难而不公平时，
你有两个选择：
When life is hard and unfair,
you have two options:

253
00:31:28,441 --> 00:31:32,961
你要么逃跑……
要么反击。
You either run away...
or you fight back.

254
00:31:33,121 --> 00:31:35,241
停下来。哎哟，停下来！
Stop. Ow, stop!

255
00:31:35,401 --> 00:31:40,161
- 但没有什么能伤害你，对吧？
- 停下来。你真烦人。
- But nothing can hurt, right?
- Stop. You're so annoying.

256
00:31:40,321 --> 00:31:43,481
你是随波逐流，
还是坚守立场？
Do you just go along,
or will you stand your ground?

257
00:31:43,641 --> 00:31:48,641
- 我们讨论重要的事情。
- 你真是……！
- We talk about the things that matter.
- You're so...!

258
00:31:48,801 --> 00:31:51,601
你好，你在做什么？
Hello, what are you doing?

259
00:31:51,761 --> 00:31:54,121
嘿！
Hey!

260
00:31:54,281 --> 00:31:59,001
- 你好！
&lt;i>- Buen Camino！&lt;/i>
- Hello!
<i>- Buen Camino!</i>

261
00:32:12,521 --> 00:32:16,081
来吧。我们走吧。
Come on. Let's get going.

262
00:32:24,641 --> 00:32:27,961
&lt;i>嘿！你好吗？&lt;/i>
<i>Hey! How are you doing?</i>

263
00:32:28,121 --> 00:32:32,481
真的很糟糕！
我想回家。我要走了。
Really bad!
I want to go home. I'm bailing.

264
00:32:35,561 --> 00:32:41,801
&lt;i>- Gitze，你不是……&lt;/i>
- 啊？愚蠢的联系。
<i>- Gitze, you are not...</i>
- Huh? Stupid connection.

265
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:45,321
你好？你说什么？
Hello? What did you say?

266
00:32:45,481 --> 00:32:50,601
&lt;i>在去过那座大教堂并点燃蜡烛之前不要回家。&lt;/i>
<i>Don't come home until you've been
to that cathedral and lit that candle.</i>

267
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:53,281
是的。
Yes.

268
00:33:00,521 --> 00:33:03,361
第 6 天
DAY 6

269
00:33:03,521 --> 00:33:06,721
还有 118 公里
118 kilometers to go

270
00:33:14,761 --> 00:33:19,841
- 你要喝牛奶吗？
- 是。但我喜欢鲜牛奶。
- Would you like milk?
- Yes. But I like fresh milk.

271
00:33:20,001 --> 00:33:23,721
&lt;i>新鲜牛奶？新鲜牛奶？&lt;/i>
<i>Leche fresco? Fresco?</i>

272
00:33:23,881 --> 00:33:27,361
&lt;i>新鲜牛奶&lt;/i>，是的。热牛奶……
<i>Fresco,</i> yes. Hot milk...

273
00:33:27,521 --> 00:33:32,161
不，不。新鲜牛奶……
No, no. Fresh...

274
00:33:32,321 --> 00:33:37,201
这种牛奶可以永远保存。
我想要新鲜的……直接从……
This milk lasts forever.
I want fresh... straight from...

275
00:33:37,361 --> 00:33:41,681
- Gitze，这是咖啡。冷静点。
- 在 cortado 的土地上还有这样的咖啡？
- Gitze, it's coffee. Calm down.
- Coffee like this in the land of cortado?

276
00:33:41,841 --> 00:33:46,921
&lt;i>- Caliente。&lt;/i> 热的。可以吗？
- 可以。
<i>- Caliente.</i> Hot. It's okay?
- Okay.

277
00:33:47,081 --> 00:33:48,841
谢谢。
Thank you.

278
00:33:49,001 --> 00:33:53,521
我受不了超高温牛奶。
有余味。
I can't stand UHT milk.
It has that aftertaste.

279
00:33:53,681 --> 00:33:58,121
你妈妈煮的咖啡太难喝了。
天哪，太难喝了！
Your mother made bad coffee.
Good grief, it was awful!

280
00:33:58,281 --> 00:34:02,681
水温不高，咖啡豆也太少，
但我毫无怨言地喝了下去 -
Lukewarm water and too few beans,
but I drank it without complaining -

281
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:07,681
因为咖啡不重要，重要的是和谁一起喝。
because it's not about coffee.
Everything is about who you drink it with.

282
00:34:07,841 --> 00:34:09,921
能和你妈妈一起喝，我很幸运。
I was lucky to drink it with your mother.

283
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:15,841
爸爸，我们能不能有半个小时不谈论妈妈？
Dad, can we have half an hour
when we don't talk about Mom?

284
00:34:29,281 --> 00:34:32,321
你和爱情呢？
What about you and love?

285
00:34:32,481 --> 00:34:35,961
你的生活中还没有其他人吗？
Still no one else in your life?

286
00:34:36,121 --> 00:34:39,801
我生活中有很多人。
There are lots of people in my life.

287
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:46,601
我有一个非常亲密的朋友。
她的名字叫丽莎。
I have a really close friend.
Her name is Lisa.

288
00:34:46,761 --> 00:34:51,201
但你没有爱你的人，
也没有你爱的人。
But you don't have someone who loves you,
and don't have someone you love.

289
00:34:52,681 --> 00:34:59,241
爱需要勇气。别无他法。
你只需要敢于去做。
Love takes courage. Nothing else.
You just have to dare to do it.

290
00:34:59,401 --> 00:35:03,041
敢于让自己变得脆弱和无助。
Dare to make yourself
vulnerable and defenseless.

291
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:07,321
也许是缺乏勇气？
Maybe it's the courage that's lacking?

292
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:12,081
我不想谈论我和我爸爸的爱情生活。
I don't want to talk
about my love life with my dad.

293
00:35:12,241 --> 00:35:15,721
我有朋友可以做到。
I have my friends for that.

294
00:35:19,601 --> 00:35:23,441
顺便说一句，朋友也是爱。
And by the way, friends are love too.

295
00:35:27,601 --> 00:35:33,201
而且你不会分享很多关于你自己的事情。
And it's not like you share
a whole lot about yourself.

296
00:35:33,361 --> 00:35:36,921
有时感觉就像你在讲课。
Sometimes
it feels like you're giving a lecture.

297
00:35:44,681 --> 00:35:51,521
好吧，我们不必再谈论它了。
Well, we don't have to talk
any more about it.

298
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:04,841
爸爸？
Dad?

299
00:36:05,001 --> 00:36:08,121
- 嗨。
- 你好。
- Hi.
- Hello.

300
00:36:08,281 --> 00:36:12,001
- 他在干什么？
- 爸爸！
- What's he doing?
- Dad!

301
00:36:12,161 --> 00:36:15,761
- 嘿……
- 你在干什么？
- Hey there...
- What are you doing?

302
00:36:15,921 --> 00:36:20,761
- 爸爸，你在干什么？
- 他是糖尿病患者吗？
- Dad, what are you doing?
- Is he diabetic?

303
00:36:20,921 --> 00:36:24,201
爸爸，看我！
Dad, look at me!

304
00:36:25,801 --> 00:36:29,081
- 别……
- 醒醒！
- Don't...
- Wake up!

305
00:36:29,241 --> 00:36:33,041
- 他血糖过低！
- 这里不允许暴力！
- He's hypoglycemic!
- Violence has no place here!

306
00:36:33,201 --> 00:36:36,841
- 爸爸，你要去哪里？
- 听我说！
- Where are you going, Dad?
- Listen to me!

307
00:36:37,001 --> 00:36:41,081
他显然是糖尿病患者。
你是他的女儿。你一定知道！
He's clearly diabetic.
You're his daughter. You must know!

308
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:44,281
你有饼干或果汁吗？
他需要糖。
Do you have a cookie or juice?
He needs sugar.

309
00:36:44,441 --> 00:36:47,721
- 他不是糖尿病患者。
- 我会解决这个问题。
- He isn't diabetic.
- I'll fix this.

310
00:36:47,881 --> 00:36:52,161
- 他现在需要糖！
- 等一下！
- He needs sugar, now!
- Wait up!

311
00:36:52,321 --> 00:36:56,441
我们会处理好的。别担心。
We'll take care of it. Don't worry.

312
00:37:04,881 --> 00:37:08,481
他现在会没事的。
He'll be fine now.

313
00:37:10,881 --> 00:37:15,361
- 让他摄入糖分很重要。
- 是的。
- It's important that he gets sugar.
- Yes.

314
00:37:15,521 --> 00:37:18,321
爸爸？喝点。
Dad? Drink.

315
00:37:18,481 --> 00:37:22,121
没有补给品，你就不能去远足。
You can't go on a hike without supplies.

316
00:37:26,361 --> 00:37:28,841
- 坐在阴凉处。
- 你还好吗？
- Sit in the shade.
- Are you all right?

317
00:37:30,801 --> 00:37:34,161
爸爸，你有糖尿病吗？
Do you have diabetes, Dad?

318
00:37:34,321 --> 00:37:36,721
是的。
Yes.

319
00:37:39,001 --> 00:37:42,201
你不认为我应该知道吗？
And you didn't think I should know that?

320
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:49,761
这不是你炫耀的东西。
这是老年糖尿病。真的很迷人。
It's not something you flaunt.
It's old man diabetes. Really charming.

321
00:37:49,921 --> 00:37:54,361
我们必须确保
你吃喝。
We have to make sure
that you eat and drink.

322
00:37:54,521 --> 00:37:59,001
确保你注射胰岛素。
这不是开玩笑。
Make sure you take your insulin.
It is not a joke.

323
00:37:59,161 --> 00:38:04,801
这是 2 型糖尿病，到目前为止
我不需要任何胰岛素。
It's type 2, and so far
I don't need any insulin.

324
00:38:04,961 --> 00:38:09,441
我是个成年人了。我可以自己照顾饼干和果汁。
I'm a grown man. I can take care
of my own crackers and juice.

325
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:12,921
显然你不能！瑞典人做到了。
Clearly you can't! The Swedes did.

326
00:38:19,641 --> 00:38:23,881
当你们是一家人时，你们会互相告诉对方这些事情。
You tell each other these things
when you're a family.

327
00:38:25,881 --> 00:38:31,041
就像我想知道妈妈第一次生病时的情况一样。
Just like I would have liked to know
when Mom first got sick.

328
00:38:34,321 --> 00:38:39,601
- 我们不想让你担心。
- 骨癌，3 期！
- We didn't want to worry you.
- Bone cancer, stage 3!

329
00:38:39,761 --> 00:38:43,921
我有充分的理由担心。
There was every conceivable
reason for me to worry.

330
00:38:44,081 --> 00:38:46,161
是的。
Yeah.

331
00:38:48,281 --> 00:38:52,521
有些事情很难说。
Some things are hard to say.

332
00:39:42,041 --> 00:39:43,761
嗨。
Hi.

333
00:39:43,921 --> 00:39:46,521
圣胡利安修道院 -
Monasterio de San Julian de Samos -

334
00:39:46,681 --> 00:39:51,241
1558 年被烧毁
后来重建。
burned down in 1558
and was later rebuilt.

335
00:39:51,401 --> 00:39:55,441
对于卡米诺来说，这是一个具有巨大象征意义的地方。
It's a place of enormous symbolic value
for the Camino.

336
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:59,241
这里有哥特式、巴洛克式
和文艺复兴时期的建筑。
There's Gothic, Baroque
and Renaissance architecture.

337
00:39:59,401 --> 00:40:02,841
爸爸，糖尿病！
你需要吃点东西喝点东西。
Dad, diabetes!
You need to eat and drink something.

338
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:09,321
我正在努力为你打开世界。
让这座修道院产生历史共鸣 -
I'm trying to open the world for you. To
give this monastery historical resonance -

339
00:40:09,481 --> 00:40:12,881
- 你想谈谈饼干吗？
- and you want to talk about crackers?

340
00:40:13,041 --> 00:40:15,201
好吧，我只是想……
Well, I'm just trying to...

341
00:40:15,361 --> 00:40:18,961
我们总是为旅行做好准备，
你妈妈和我 -
We always prepared for a trip,
your mother and I -

342
00:40:19,121 --> 00:40:22,361
- 了解了我们在路上会看到什么。
- learned about what we'd see on our way.

343
00:40:40,161 --> 00:40:46,441
圣本笃建立了许多修道院。
最重要的是，意大利的卡西诺山 -
Saint Benedict founded many monasteries.
Most importantly, Monte Cassino in Italy -

344
00:40:46,601 --> 00:40:51,401
他被埋葬在
他姐姐斯科拉斯蒂卡的墓地。
where he was buried at the same place
as his sister, Scholastica.

345
00:40:51,561 --> 00:40:55,601
嘿，亲爱的。
现在不是个好时机。
Hey, sweetie.
It's not a great time right now.

346
00:40:57,081 --> 00:41:01,881
- 丽莎，现在不是个好时机。
&lt;i>- 帮帮我。&lt;/i> 没有电话。
- Lisa, it's not a good time.
<i>- Por favor.</i> No phone.

347
00:41:02,041 --> 00:41:06,801
我被僧侣训斥了。
我会给你回电话。再见。
I'm getting scolded by a monk.
I'll call you back. Bye.

348
00:41:09,001 --> 00:41:13,081
- 你为什么还要接电话？
- 冷静点。我挂了，好吗？
- Why do you even pick up?
- Relax. I hung up, all right?

349
00:41:13,241 --> 00:41:17,361
这是修道院！
这不是你当地的时髦咖啡馆。
This is a monastery!
It's not your local hipster café.

350
00:41:17,521 --> 00:41:23,041
你需要降低声音。这是一座修道院。人们生活在沉默中。
You need to lower your voice. This is
a monastery. People live in silence.

351
00:41:23,201 --> 00:41:25,841
表示尊重！
Show respect!

352
00:41:38,201 --> 00:41:42,801
我们走着走着。
We're walking and walking.

353
00:41:42,961 --> 00:41:47,681
&lt;i>- 然后呢？&lt;/i>
- 我的意思是...
<i>- And?</i>
- I mean...

354
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:50,761
我们就是合不来。
We just don't get along.

355
00:42:00,401 --> 00:42:02,481
&lt;i>那荷兰人呢？&lt;/i>
<i>And what about the Dutch guy?</i>

356
00:42:02,641 --> 00:42:06,241
我认为他不想知道
他要当爸爸了。
I don't think he wants to know
he's going to be a dad.

357
00:42:11,801 --> 00:42:15,801
那么，你的水泡怎么样了？
So, how are your blisters?

358
00:42:15,961 --> 00:42:19,241
- 凉鞋有帮助。
- 哦。很好。
- The sandals helped.
- Oh. Good.

359
00:42:43,481 --> 00:42:50,121
朝圣是一种仪式运动，
追求距离和行为。
A pilgrimage is a ceremonial movement,
that goes for the distance, behavior.

360
00:42:50,281 --> 00:42:54,001
一切都是既定的，
不只是自由发挥或四处巡游。
It's all established,
not just freestyling or cruising around.

361
00:42:54,161 --> 00:42:58,761
- 模式是基础。
- 是的，这是一种仪式，一种漫长的仪式。
- The pattern is the foundation.
- Yes, it's a rite, an elongated ritual.

362
00:42:58,921 --> 00:43:02,921
而且，它为朝圣者提供了宗教复兴和思想改变。
And, it offers the pilgrim
a religious renewal and change of mind.

363
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:06,921
- 成年礼。
- 其中包括分离状态。
- A rite of passage.
- And it includes the state of separation.

364
00:43:07,081 --> 00:43:13,441
过渡阶段。朝圣者重复过去神话人物所教的内容。
The liminal phase. Pilgrims repeat what
mythical persons were taught in the past.

365
00:43:13,601 --> 00:43:18,361
一遍又一遍地重复，
然后就会出现某种模式 -
Repetition again and again,
and then a certain pattern will appear -

366
00:43:18,521 --> 00:43:22,561
在那一刻，
模式到达了更多...
and at that moment
the pattern arrives to even more...

367
00:43:22,721 --> 00:43:27,721
没错。你应该在某个时候走一走
Exactly. You should walk
the Via Francigena at some point.

368
00:43:27,881 --> 00:43:31,281
- It's such a beautiful pilgrimage.
- Maybe I will.

369
00:43:31,441 --> 00:43:35,561
- 好的。&lt;i>Buen Camino！&lt;/i>
- 再见。
- Okay. <i>Buen Camino!</i>
- Bye.

370
00:43:39,601 --> 00:43:42,801
- 你应该追这样的男人。
That's the kind of man you should chase.

371
00:43:42,961 --> 00:43:46,681
- 我会无聊得要死。
- 无聊？
- I'd be bored to death.
- Bored?

372
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:49,961
和这么聪明的人在一起？
With someone of such intellect?

373
00:43:52,561 --> 00:43:56,721
- 你看起来真漂亮。
- 我每 15 分钟就要小便一次。
- You look beautiful.
- I have to pee every 15 minutes.

374
00:43:56,881 --> 00:44:01,681
- 真的吗？
- 但怀孕真好。
- Oh really?
- But being pregnant is wonderful.

375
00:44:01,841 --> 00:44:05,961
- 那孩子的父亲呢？他在吗？
- 他真是个混蛋。
- And the father? Is he here?
- He's a piece of shit.

376
00:44:06,121 --> 00:44:09,561
我正走着，想找到离开他的力量。
I'm walking to find the strength
to leave him.

377
00:44:13,201 --> 00:44:15,961
天气不错。
Nice weather.

378
00:44:17,281 --> 00:44:21,721
我不太在乎天气。
我来这里是为了纪念我已故的妻子。
I don't care so much about the weather.
I'm here to honor my late wife.

379
00:44:26,641 --> 00:44:29,841
- 我第三次来这里。
- 第三次？
- I'm here for the third time.
- The third time?

380
00:44:32,161 --> 00:44:37,921
第一次，我走卡米诺，因为我的丈夫在车祸中丧生。
First time, I walked the Camino because
my husband died in a car accident.

381
00:44:38,081 --> 00:44:40,161
52岁。
52 years old.

382
00:44:40,321 --> 00:44:45,161
我第二次走朝圣之路时
我得了乳腺癌。
Second time I walked the Camino
I had the cancer of the breast.

383
00:44:45,321 --> 00:44:50,961
现在我走朝圣之路是因为我最好的朋友
去年死于白血病。
Now I walk the Camino because my best
friend died from leukemia last year.

384
00:44:52,801 --> 00:44:56,721
我非常想念她。
I miss her, a lot.

385
00:44:58,241 --> 00:45:04,161
但走路对我有好处。
你知道，向前看。
But it's good for me to walk.
You know, move forward.

386
00:45:05,921 --> 00:45:12,881
而且我认为我已经战胜了癌症。
虽然没有承诺，但我有希望。
And I think I survived cancer.
No promises, but I have hope.

387
00:45:16,761 --> 00:45:20,121
- 我需要休息一下。
- 哦，当然。
- I need a little rest.
- Oh, sure.

388
00:45:21,881 --> 00:45:24,721
- 再见！
- 再见。
- Bye!
- Bye-bye.

389
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:44,281
- 再见。
- 好的，再见。
- See you.
- Yeah, bye.

390
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:48,841
你还好吗？
Are you all right?

391
00:45:57,681 --> 00:46:02,281
- 你要果汁还是饼干？
- 我只需要坐一会儿。
- Do you want juice or crackers?
- I just need to sit for a bit.

392
00:46:02,441 --> 00:46:06,521
- 爸爸，我觉得最好...
- 我不是小孩，好吗。
- Dad, I think it would be good to...
- I'm not a child, okay.

393
00:46:15,881 --> 00:46:19,041
我只是想帮助你。
I'm just trying to help you.

394
00:46:33,481 --> 00:46:36,961
- 你看起来需要这个。
- 谢谢！
- You look like you need this.
- Thanks!

395
00:46:37,121 --> 00:46:40,081
- 欢迎来到 La Senda。
- 谢谢！
- Welcome to La Senda.
- Thanks!

396
00:46:56,601 --> 00:47:00,001
您好，&lt;i>先生&lt;/i>。
Hello, <i>señor.</i>

397
00:47:00,161 --> 00:47:05,281
- 这咖啡很好喝。
- 西班牙人就是这样煮咖啡的。
- This coffee is very good.
- This is how we make coffee in Spain.

398
00:47:05,441 --> 00:47:08,441
不，不是。相信我。
No, it's not. Believe me.

399
00:47:08,601 --> 00:47:12,841
这不是你在卡米诺路上煮咖啡的方式。
This is not how you make coffee
on the fucking Camino.

400
00:47:13,001 --> 00:47:18,121
这里有宗教人士。
脏话可能会冒犯某人。
There are religious people here.
Bad words might offend someone.

401
00:47:18,281 --> 00:47:24,881
哦，当然。我很抱歉！
我通常真的不...
Oh, of course. I'm sorry!
I really don't usually...

402
00:47:25,041 --> 00:47:28,121
&lt;i>这个女孩的头都长在屁股上了。&lt;/i>
<i>The girl has her head up her ass.</i>

403
00:47:28,281 --> 00:47:33,841
&lt;i>- 夫人，请原谅&lt;/i>...
- 不，不，不。那是意大利语。
<i>- Señora, scusi</i> for the...
- No, no, no. That's Italian.

404
00:47:34,001 --> 00:47:38,761
- 对。
- 我妈妈不懂英语。
- Right.
- My mother doesn't understand English.

405
00:47:38,921 --> 00:47:41,801
她看起来疯了。
She seems bonkers.

406
00:47:42,921 --> 00:47:45,841
不过还是谢谢你。
But thank you.

407
00:47:48,641 --> 00:47:55,561
- 妈妈，你在干什么？
- 那个疯女孩怎么了？
- Mom, what are you doing?
- What's wrong with that crazy girl?

408
00:48:21,281 --> 00:48:26,761
- 你玩吗？
- 是的。可以吗？
- You play?
- Yeah. Is it okay?

409
00:48:28,121 --> 00:48:32,601
哦，你想玩吗？
好啊，可以，为什么不呢？
Oh, you want to play?
Yeah, okay, why not?

410
00:48:32,761 --> 00:48:35,801
好的。
Okay.

411
00:48:36,961 --> 00:48:40,201
10。
One-zero.

412
00:48:42,481 --> 00:48:44,601
抱歉！
Sorry!

413
00:48:50,041 --> 00:48:54,081
- 第一次踏上卡米诺之路？
- 是的。
- First time on the Camino?
- Yeah.

414
00:48:54,241 --> 00:48:57,561
很可能也是最后一次。
And last time, probably.

415
00:49:00,241 --> 00:49:04,881
为了取悦妈妈，我和爸爸一起散步……
416
00:49:05,041 --> 00:49:08,761
有点……有点复杂。
417
00:49:10,841 --> 00:49:13,881
不，我不再玩了。
418
00:49:14,041 --> 00:49:18,121
你赢了。我需要去厨房帮妈妈做晚饭。
Walking with my father
to please my mother, it's...

416
00:49:05,041 --> 00:49:08,761
It's a bit... It's complicated.

417
00:49:10,841 --> 00:49:13,881
No, no more play for me.

418
00:49:14,041 --> 00:49:18,121
You win. I need to go to the kitchen
and help my mother to make dinner.

419
00:49:18,281 --> 00:49:22,441
- 给我？
- 给你和其他 20 个人。
- For me?
- For you and 20 other people.

420
00:49:22,601 --> 00:49:25,281
- 但我赢了！
- 是的，你赢了。
- But I win!
- Yeah, you win.

421
00:49:25,441 --> 00:49:28,081
- 也许稍后再玩？
- 再见！
- Maybe play later?
- Bye!

422
00:49:33,521 --> 00:49:36,361
嗨。
Hi.

423
00:49:40,721 --> 00:49:43,881
乒乓球。
Table tennis.

424
00:49:45,241 --> 00:49:48,241
他们煮的咖啡很好喝。
They make good coffee.

425
00:49:55,441 --> 00:49:57,841
这叫见朋友。
This is called meeting friends.

426
00:50:26,801 --> 00:50:29,681
疼吗？
Did it hurt?

427
00:50:30,921 --> 00:50:35,561
- 疼吗？
- 今天和 Mirna 聊天。
- Did what hurt?
- Talking to Mirna today.

428
00:50:37,321 --> 00:50:41,001
你可以再试一次。
You could try again.

429
00:50:41,161 --> 00:50:45,721
如果你需要和某人说话，那就说吧。
If you have a need to speak
with someone, then do it.

430
00:50:45,881 --> 00:50:48,801
我来这里是为了你妈妈。
I'm here for your mother.

431
00:50:51,761 --> 00:50:55,161
当然，还有什么？
Sure, what else?

432
00:50:55,321 --> 00:50:59,241
还有什么？
What else?

433
00:50:59,401 --> 00:51:06,001
- 我不喜欢你嘲讽的语气。
- 这不是嘲讽。
- I don't like your mocking tone.
- It's not mocking.

434
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:19,761
一切始终都是
关于你和妈妈。
Everything has just always been
about you and Mom.

435
00:51:19,921 --> 00:51:22,681
妈妈和你，你和妈妈。
Mom and you, you and Mom.

436
00:51:22,841 --> 00:51:25,721
我不知道你在说什么。
I don't know what you're talking about.

437
00:51:29,601 --> 00:51:33,921
一切始终都是关于你们两个。
It has always been about you two.

438
00:51:34,081 --> 00:51:38,961
关于聪明，
关于你读过的东西——
439
00:51:39,121 --> 00:51:44,441
关于信仰、
存在和学术的无休止的争论。
440
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:47,961
所以现在我们反对
文学和灵性？
441
00:51:48,121 --> 00:51:51,001
它并不总是……
442
00:51:53,241 --> 00:51:57,281
不能和你在一起读书并不总是那么容易。
443
00:51:58,641 --> 00:52:04,161
你有自己的兴趣。
你打网球打得好。
About being smart,
about what you had read -

439
00:51:39,121 --> 00:51:44,441
and endless debates about faith,
existence and academic stuff.

440
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:47,961
So now we are against
literature and spirituality?

441
00:51:48,121 --> 00:51:51,001
It just hasn't always...

442
00:51:53,241 --> 00:51:57,281
It wasn't always easy
not being able to read in your company.

443
00:51:58,641 --> 00:52:04,161
You had your own interests.
You were good at tennis.

444
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:09,561
上帝让风吹向被剪毛的羊。
God tempers the wind to the shorn sheep.

445
00:52:12,201 --> 00:52:18,721
网球没有给我赢得很多分数
在家里，现在呢？
Tennis didn't win me a lot of points
back home, now did it?

446
00:52:18,881 --> 00:52:22,721
一家人
不是一场比赛，吉茨。
Being a family
is not a competition, Gitze.

447
00:52:24,001 --> 00:52:26,961
我们的餐桌上可以容纳各种各样的人。
There was room for all types of people
at our dinner table.

448
00:52:27,121 --> 00:52:31,321
你从不来看我的比赛。
You never came to my matches.

449
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:38,321
妈妈总是要写布道文，
或者要召集悲伤支持小组。
Mom always had a sermon to write,
or a grief support group to gather.

450
00:52:40,321 --> 00:52:46,641
你总是要批改作业。
你不知道我是否擅长。
You always had papers to grade.
You had no idea if I was any good.

451
00:52:46,801 --> 00:52:52,361
- 运动对我来说毫无意义。
- 父母不是为了这项运动而来的。
- Sports doesn't mean anything to me.
- The parents didn't come for the sport.

452
00:52:52,521 --> 00:52:55,841
他们是为了孩子而来的。
They came for their children.

453
00:52:56,001 --> 00:53:01,401
如果你想抱怨你的童年，那就找个地方坐吧。
If you want to whine about your
childhood, find somewhere else to sit.

454
00:54:00,841 --> 00:54:03,361
你好。
Hello.

455
00:54:11,361 --> 00:54:16,441
酒精和 2 型糖尿病？
可以吗？
Alcohol and type 2 diabetes?
Is that allowed?

456
00:54:22,041 --> 00:54:27,041
放松。我来是为了和平。
Relax. I come in peace.

457
00:54:27,201 --> 00:54:32,561
- 一杯可乐，&lt;i>谢谢。
- 给她一杯啤酒。
- A Coke, <i>por favor.
- Una cervesa</i> for her.

458
00:54:35,121 --> 00:54:37,721
也许你应该喝醉？
Maybe you should get drunk?

459
00:54:37,881 --> 00:54:42,641
别想那么多了，
别在意别人怎么想。
Get out of your head,
not care what everyone else thinks.

460
00:54:42,801 --> 00:54:46,841
我只想要一杯可乐，可以吗？
I just want a Coke, okay?

461
00:54:48,321 --> 00:54:52,521
你的母亲……
我们有时一起喝得酩酊大醉。
Your mother...
We got very drunk together sometimes.

462
00:54:52,681 --> 00:54:56,041
我们聊天，做爱。
We talked, we made love.

463
00:54:56,201 --> 00:55:01,121
爸爸，请不要这样。我明白了。
Dad, please don't. I get it.

464
00:55:01,281 --> 00:55:04,881
我明白
你很悲伤，而且……
I understand
that you're grieving and that...

465
00:55:05,041 --> 00:55:10,281
不，我受尽折磨，该死的，
从内心深处！
No, I'm in torment, goddammit,
to my very core!

466
00:55:10,441 --> 00:55:13,881
我失去了我生命中的见证人，我的灵魂伴侣。
I've lost my life witness, my soulmate.

467
00:55:14,041 --> 00:55:18,441
没有爱，你什么都不是，当你孤身一人时，什么都不是。
You're nothing without love,
nothing when you're alone.

468
00:55:18,601 --> 00:55:21,841
你仍然很了不起
尽管你孤身一人。
You're still something
although you're alone.

469
00:55:22,001 --> 00:55:28,321
如果没有人听到你，如果没有人看到你，你是什么？
What are you if no one hears you,
if no one sees you?

470
00:55:28,481 --> 00:55:32,201
你是你自己，
这仍然很了不起。
You're yourself,
and that's still something.

471
00:55:32,361 --> 00:55:35,721
- 我一个人过得很好。
- 哦，拜托！
- I'm doing fine on my own.
- Oh, come on!

472
00:55:35,881 --> 00:55:41,201
- 那是什么意思？
- 你不开心。任何人都看得出来。
- What is that supposed to mean?
- You're not happy. Anyone can see that.

473
00:55:41,361 --> 00:55:46,921
- 你什么都不懂。
- 你没有爱，亲爱的。
- You don't know shit.
- You have no love, honey.

474
00:55:47,081 --> 00:55:49,961
“爱让一切都变得甜蜜。”
"Everything is sweetened by love."

475
00:55:50,121 --> 00:55:53,881
我还是不会谈论
我和我爸爸的爱情生活。
I'm still not talking
about my love life with my dad.

476
00:55:54,041 --> 00:55:58,521
没什么好说的，
所以这真的不重要。
There's not much to talk about,
so it doesn't really matter.

477
00:56:00,721 --> 00:56:07,801
好吧，现在我们到了这里，
我们只是两次什么都没有？
Okay, so now we're here,
and we're just two times nothing?

478
00:56:07,961 --> 00:56:11,081
什么都没有，是吗？
Nothing at all, is that it?

479
00:56:14,601 --> 00:56:17,641
- 你妈妈和我在一起。
- 我知道她在。
- Your mother is with me.
- I know she is.

480
00:56:17,801 --> 00:56:22,521
你把她放在心里，
但我也在这里。
And you carry her in your heart,
but I'm here too.

481
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:41,241
那是她吗……？
Is that her...?

482
00:56:41,401 --> 00:56:43,881
那是她的骨灰吗？
Is that her ashes?

483
00:56:44,041 --> 00:56:47,521
在你的腰包里吗？
In your fanny pack?

484
00:56:50,441 --> 00:56:55,401
你告诉我妈妈的骨灰盒
被放在公墓里了。
You told me Mom's urn
was placed in the common grave.

485
00:56:55,561 --> 00:57:00,601
- 你骗我？
- 不，我只是放不下。
- You lied to me?
- No, I just couldn't let go.

486
00:57:00,761 --> 00:57:03,681
想到伊丽莎白的骨灰
洒在黑暗中……
487
00:57:03,841 --> 00:57:10,121
这不可能是真的！
我不知道该说什么。
488
00:57:10,281 --> 00:57:15,361
- 你不要这么做！
- 你不懂悲伤！
489
00:57:15,521 --> 00:57:20,561
你不懂真正的悲伤，真正的渴望。
这就像一把刺进心脏的刀。
The thought of Elisabeth's ashes
down in the dark...

487
00:57:03,841 --> 00:57:10,121
This can't be real!
I don't know what to say.

488
00:57:10,281 --> 00:57:15,361
- You just don't do that!
- You don't know grief!

489
00:57:15,521 --> 00:57:20,561
You don't know real grief, real longing.
It's a knife to the heart.

490
00:57:20,721 --> 00:57:25,521
谁会带着死去的妻子去西班牙的酒吧
并对他们的女儿撒谎？
Who takes their dead wife to a bar
in Spain and lies to their daughter?

491
00:57:25,681 --> 00:57:30,041
她梦见了卡米诺，
她梦见了那座大教堂——
She dreamed of the Camino,
she dreamed of that cathedral -

492
00:57:30,201 --> 00:57:32,001
我打算确保
她能体验到这一切。
and I intend to make sure
she experiences it.

493
00:57:32,161 --> 00:57:36,201
她再也不会做梦了！
她什么都体验不到！
She doesn't dream anymore!
She can't experience anything!

494
00:57:36,361 --> 00:57:39,681
她死了！记住这一点！
She is dead! Get it into your head!

495
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:48,281
别管我！
Leave me alone!

496
00:57:48,441 --> 00:57:54,081
- 不，该死的！伊丽莎白！
- 不要呼吸！不要呼吸！
- No, goddammit! Elisabeth!
- Don't breathe! Don't breathe!

497
00:57:54,241 --> 00:57:59,201
求求你，谁都别呼吸！这是我妈妈！
Nobody breathe, please! It's my mother!

498
00:58:00,601 --> 00:58:04,281
- 让我来帮你。
- 我自己可以！
- Let me help you.
- I can do it myself!

499
00:58:26,481 --> 00:58:30,921
她身上有个洞。
把袋子关紧。
There's a hole in her.
Keep the bag closed.

500
00:58:37,841 --> 00:58:41,961
- 我要回家了。
- 不，Gitze，停下来！
- I'm going home.
- No, Gitze, stop!

501
00:58:42,121 --> 00:58:48,401
我不是我自己，你知道吗？
我感觉很糟糕，好吗？
I'm not myself, you know?
I feel like shit, all right?

502
00:58:50,361 --> 00:58:52,441
你打我了！
You hit me!

503
00:58:52,601 --> 00:58:56,761
对不起。我喝醉了。
喝酒对我真的很不好。
I'm sorry. I'm totally drunk.
Drinking is really bad for me.

504
00:58:56,921 --> 00:59:02,761
- 我还是要回家。
- 不，Gitze。操。该死的。停下来！
- I'm still going home.
- No, Gitze. Fuck. Goddammit. Stop!

505
00:59:02,921 --> 00:59:05,241
别碰我。
Don't touch me.

506
00:59:05,401 --> 00:59:08,561
你得打我！这样我们就扯平了。
You have to hit me! Then we're even.

507
00:59:08,721 --> 00:59:14,321
- 我不想！
- 是的！别这么卑鄙。
- I don't want to!
- Yes! Don't be such a doormat.

508
00:59:14,481 --> 00:59:18,561
- 你刚才叫我什么？
- 来吧，卑鄙的人！
- What did you just call me?
- Come on, doormat!

509
00:59:19,601 --> 00:59:25,121
你知道吗，爸爸？我们完了。
You know what, Dad? We're done.

510
00:59:25,281 --> 00:59:28,961
我们根本就不适合彼此。
We're just no good for each other.

511
00:59:29,121 --> 00:59:36,081
我们互相误解，
我们互相伤害……
We misunderstand each other,
we hurt each other...

512
00:59:36,241 --> 00:59:41,001
好吧，你伤害了我，
所以我现在要去孔波斯特拉了——
Well, you're hurting me,
so now I'm going on to Compostela -

513
00:59:41,161 --> 00:59:47,961
然后我会飞回家。
但你可以走你的朝圣之路。
and then I'll fly home.
But you can walk your Camino.

514
00:59:48,121 --> 00:59:49,521
Gitze...
Gitze...

515
00:59:49,681 --> 00:59:53,961
结束了！你不给我打电话，
我也不给你打电话。
It's over! You don't call me,
and I don't call you.

516
00:59:54,121 --> 00:59:57,321
好吧，&lt;i>Buen Camino。&lt;/i>
Well, <i>Buen Camino.</i>

517
00:59:59,281 --> 01:00:01,281
嘿...
Hey...

518
01:00:01,441 --> 01:00:06,241
有一件事
我认为你应该知道。
There's one thing
I thought you should know.

519
01:00:09,761 --> 01:00:13,161
我怀孕了。
I'm pregnant.

520
01:00:13,321 --> 01:00:16,121
什么？
What?

521
01:00:16,281 --> 01:00:20,961
我真的很期待……
And I'm really looking forward...

522
01:00:23,041 --> 01:00:29,921
我相信
我会成为一个好妈妈。
And I do believe
I'll be a pretty good mother.

523
01:00:49,881 --> 01:00:53,801
- 等到明天再去怎么样？
- 不用了，谢谢！
- How about wait and go tomorrow?
- No, thank you!

524
01:01:03,561 --> 01:01:07,721
&lt;i>我是 Lisa。请留言。&lt;/i>
<i>It's Lisa. Please leave a message.</i>

525
01:01:07,881 --> 01:01:13,601
嘿，是我。我离开了他。
我不想再和他在一起了。
Hey, it's me. I left him.
I don't want to be with him anymore.

526
01:01:13,761 --> 01:01:19,961
他他妈的打我了！
他真是个傲慢的混蛋。
He fucking hit me!
He's such an arrogant asshole.

527
01:01:20,121 --> 01:01:23,361
我只想回家。
I just want to go home.

528
01:02:12,241 --> 01:02:17,481
&lt;i>你好，我是 Martjin。
你好？这是谁？&lt;/i>
<i>Hello, this is Martjin.
Hello? Who is this?</i>

529
01:02:34,481 --> 01:02:37,601
第 9 天
DAY 9

530
01:02:37,761 --> 01:02:40,601
还有 36 公里
36 kilometers to go

531
01:02:54,921 --> 01:02:57,241
&lt;i>一路平安，&lt;/i>哥本哈根！
<i>Buen Camino,</i> Copenhagen!

532
01:02:58,401 --> 01:03:01,401
今天不太爱说话？
Not very talkative today?

533
01:03:01,561 --> 01:03:04,641
我们可以一起走，
一起保持沉默？
We could walk together,
be silent together?

534
01:03:04,801 --> 01:03:08,601
- 你说什么？
- 我们可以一起走，保持沉默。
- What did you say?
- We can walk and be silent together.

535
01:03:15,721 --> 01:03:19,521
- 你真的在勾引我吗？
- 对不起？
- You're seriously hitting on me?
- Excuse me?

536
01:03:22,641 --> 01:03:24,961
你在卡米诺勾引我！
You are hitting on me on the Camino!

537
01:03:25,121 --> 01:03:31,761
我只是想我们可以一起走，
现在你和你爸爸都不在了……
I just thought we might walk together,
now that you and your dad aren't...

538
01:03:31,921 --> 01:03:38,161
这是自中世纪以来朝圣者们徒步的地方！
This is a place where pilgrims
have hiked since the Middle Ages!

539
01:03:39,801 --> 01:03:45,321
这不是搭讪女士们的地方
让她们在睡袋里保持温暖。
It's not a place to pick up ladies
to stay warm in your sleeping bag.

540
01:03:46,921 --> 01:03:52,241
我怀孕了。
你听到了吗，嗯？
I'm pregnant.
Did you hear that, huh?

541
01:03:52,401 --> 01:03:55,201
是的，我怀孕了！
Yes, I'm pregnant!

542
01:03:56,761 --> 01:03:59,721
我可不是什么花瓶！
I'm not just some bimbo!

543
01:03:59,881 --> 01:04:03,641
挪威，请尊重点！
Show some respect, Norway!

544
01:04:08,081 --> 01:04:10,441
什么？
What?

545
01:04:17,921 --> 01:04:22,001
- 你好。
- 你好，我要去孔波斯特拉。
- Hello.
- Hi, I need to go to Compostela.

546
01:04:22,161 --> 01:04:27,601
- 孔波斯特拉。当然。
- 现在在出租车上。
- Compostela. Of course.
- In a taxi, right now.

547
01:04:27,761 --> 01:04:32,521
是的，但我们有一个问题。
我们这里没有出租车。
Yes, but we have a problem.
We have no taxis here.

548
01:04:33,681 --> 01:04:37,841
但也许我可以为你从孔波斯特拉叫一辆出租车。
But maybe I can call one taxi
from Compostela for you.

549
01:04:38,001 --> 01:04:42,321
- 是的，那太好了。
- 三个小时，两个小时。我不知道。
- Yes, that would be great.
- Three hours, two hours. I don't know.

550
01:04:42,481 --> 01:04:47,561
- 尽快。
- 我需要查找电话号码。
- As quick as possible.
- I need to look for the phone number.

551
01:05:03,561 --> 01:05:06,841
Gitze，我一直在找你。
Gitze, I've been looking
all over for you.

552
01:05:07,001 --> 01:05:10,321
- 哦，嗨！
- 你好。
- Oh, hi!
- Hello.

553
01:05:10,481 --> 01:05:12,761
你在这里做什么？
What are you doing here?

554
01:05:12,921 --> 01:05:18,801
你父亲，
他今天早上表现得很奇怪。
Your father,
he acted quite strange this morning.

555
01:05:18,961 --> 01:05:24,081
然后他晕倒了，摔倒了，撞到了头。
也许他得了脑震荡。
Then he fainted, fell and hit his head.
Maybe he had a concussion.

556
01:05:24,241 --> 01:05:28,201
医生看过他了。他需要休息。
The doctor saw him. He needs rest.

557
01:05:29,401 --> 01:05:32,521
- 是吗？
- 我想你应该知道。
- Yeah?
- I thought you should know.

558
01:05:32,681 --> 01:05:38,241
我不知道。也许你想回去
看看你的父亲？
I don't know. Maybe you want to go back
and see your father?

559
01:05:40,761 --> 01:05:43,121
不，我不想回去。
No, I don't want to go back.

560
01:05:45,801 --> 01:05:48,641
我就是做不到。
I just can't.

561
01:06:02,601 --> 01:06:06,721
听着。
我父亲不是一个很善良的人。
Listen.
My father wasn't a very kind man.

562
01:06:08,801 --> 01:06:11,761
我们之间有过争吵，他和我。
We had our fights, him and me.

563
01:06:11,921 --> 01:06:18,561
政治、伦理、音乐、社会、
难民，实际上一切都有争吵。
Politics, ethics, music, society,
refugees, everything really.

564
01:06:20,561 --> 01:06:25,081
现在他走了，我非常想念他。
Now he's gone, and I miss him so much.

565
01:06:27,201 --> 01:06:29,721
每天。
Every day.

566
01:06:29,881 --> 01:06:34,001
你们在一起的所有故事。
我可以说：
All the stories you have together.
I could say:

567
01:06:36,001 --> 01:06:40,041
“还记得阿尔梅里亚那只有趣的狗吗？”
我们会笑 -
"Remember the funny dog in Almeria?"
and we would laugh -

568
01:06:40,201 --> 01:06:45,161
因为我们曾经在阿尔梅里亚见过一只有趣的狗。
because we once saw
a funny dog in Almeria.

569
01:06:47,001 --> 01:06:52,401
但现在我……
But now I...

570
01:06:52,561 --> 01:06:56,721
那只是他和我。
That was only for him and me.

571
01:06:56,881 --> 01:07:02,641
现在我只能孤零零地想着那只狗的形象。
Now I'm stuck with the image
of that dog, all alone.

572
01:07:06,281 --> 01:07:13,281
我现在甚至想不起和父亲发生过的任何有趣的故事。
I can't even remember one single
funny story with my father right now.

573
01:07:14,881 --> 01:07:17,081
但我想你会的。
But I think you will.

574
01:07:46,121 --> 01:07:49,481
- 谢谢。
&lt;i>- Claro。&lt;/i>
- Thank you.
<i>- Claro.</i>

575
01:08:15,921 --> 01:08:18,881
嗨，爸爸。
Hi, Dad.

576
01:08:19,041 --> 01:08:23,361
- 嗨！
- 嗨。
- Hi!
- Hi.

577
01:08:27,481 --> 01:08:31,681
- 所以你真的怀孕了？
- 是的。
- So you're really pregnant?
- Yes.

578
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:34,641
太棒了！
That's fantastic!

579
01:08:36,201 --> 01:08:38,961
嗯，当然。
Well, sure.

580
01:08:42,561 --> 01:08:47,521
但还是很新。
But it's still very new.

581
01:08:49,561 --> 01:08:55,241
我才十周。所以，是的。
I'm only at ten weeks. So, yeah.

582
01:08:55,401 --> 01:09:02,681
所以，还有一段路要走。
So, there's still some way to go.

583
01:09:02,841 --> 01:09:06,241
那么，孩子的父亲是谁？
So, who's the father?

584
01:09:06,401 --> 01:09:09,681
没有父亲。
There is no father.

585
01:09:11,161 --> 01:09:17,641
- 总是有父亲的。
- 在这种情况下，不是这样的。
- There's always a father.
- Not really in this case, no.

586
01:09:17,801 --> 01:09:20,961
所以你不知道是谁让你怀孕的？
So you don't know who got you pregnant?

587
01:09:21,121 --> 01:09:26,241
是的，我知道我是怎么怀孕的，
但没有男朋友。
Yes, I know how I got pregnant,
but there's no boyfriend.

588
01:09:26,401 --> 01:09:33,321
那只是一个荷兰人 -
It was just some Dutch guy -

589
01:09:33,481 --> 01:09:35,401
- 我和他见过一面。
- who I saw very briefly.

590
01:09:35,561 --> 01:09:37,881
他对此一无所知。
He doesn't know any of this.

591
01:09:38,041 --> 01:09:43,321
- 你能找到他吗？
- 我想不可能。
- You could find him?
- I don't think so.

592
01:09:43,481 --> 01:09:50,481
他有妻子和两个孩子。
我不能那么做。
He has a wife and two children.
I can't do that.

593
01:09:50,641 --> 01:09:54,001
但你不可能自己生孩子。
But you can't have a child by yourself.

594
01:09:56,721 --> 01:09:59,281
为什么不呢？
Why not?

595
01:09:59,441 --> 01:10:04,841
因为那太自私了
而且非常可悲。
Because that's very selfish
and incredibly sad.

596
01:10:05,001 --> 01:10:10,361
你有没有想过
生孩子的责任有多大？
Have you even considered how great
a responsibility having a child is?

597
01:10:10,521 --> 01:10:14,721
是真的吗？你别说。
我当然知道！
It is, really? You don't say.
Of course I know that!

598
01:10:15,801 --> 01:10:19,081
- 你还是可以摆脱它的。
- 你说什么？
- You can still get rid of it.
- What did you say?

599
01:10:19,241 --> 01:10:22,961
如果我没记错的话
限制是 12 周。
If I remember correctly
the limit is 12 weeks.

600
01:10:23,121 --> 01:10:30,241
嘿！你不应该对我和我的怀孕有任何意见 -
Hey! You're not supposed to have
an opinion about me and my pregnancy -

601
01:10:30,401 --> 01:10:35,401
绝对不应该对堕胎有任何意见！
and definitely not
about having an abortion!

602
01:10:35,561 --> 01:10:40,761
我们可以谈论一些事情。
我有权说出我的想法。
We can talk about things.
It's my right to say what I think.

603
01:10:40,921 --> 01:10:45,641
你需要保持安静并闭上眼睛
因为你有脑震荡。
You need to be quiet and close your eyes
because you have a concussion.

604
01:10:47,321 --> 01:10:51,281
这……这是我的决定。
This... this is my decision.

605
01:10:51,441 --> 01:10:57,481
你不需要跟我和我的孩子有任何关系。
You don't need to have anything
to do with me and my child.

606
01:10:57,641 --> 01:11:00,241
一点也不。
Not at all.

607
01:11:02,601 --> 01:11:08,961
我永远不想再和你讨论这件事了 -
And I never ever
want to discuss this with you -

608
01:11:09,121 --> 01:11:11,561
- 永远都不想。
- ever again.

609
01:11:19,521 --> 01:11:23,441
嗨！你终于接电话了。
Hi! Finally you pick up.

610
01:11:23,601 --> 01:11:29,961
&lt;i>- 我们在同一个时区！&lt;/i>
- 但我真的需要和你谈谈。
<i>- We're in the same time zone!</i>
- But I really need to speak with you.

611
01:11:30,121 --> 01:11:34,121
&lt;i>当西班牙是夜晚时，
丹麦也是夜晚。&lt;/i>
<i>When it's night in Spain,
it's night in Denmark too.</i>

612
01:11:34,281 --> 01:11:35,881
抱歉。
Sorry.

613
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:40,281
&lt;i>这得等到明天了。
时间是...&lt;/i>
<i>This has to wait until tomorrow.
The time is...</i>

614
01:11:40,441 --> 01:11:43,361
好的，再见。
Okay, bye.

615
01:12:43,841 --> 01:12:47,041
- 嗨。
- 嗨。
- Hi.
- Hi.

616
01:12:58,001 --> 01:13:03,561
- 嗨。
- 小心。那个疯狂的女孩又回来了。
- Hi.
- Watch out. The crazy girl is back.

617
01:13:05,201 --> 01:13:09,561
- 你妈妈说什么？
- 一句古老的西班牙问候语。
- What does your mother say?
- An old Spanish greeting.

618
01:13:09,721 --> 01:13:13,041
哦，好的。
Oh, okay.

619
01:13:13,201 --> 01:13:17,401
&lt;i>谢谢！&lt;/i> &lt;i>祝您好运&lt;/i>
<i>Gracias!</i> And <i>buenos días.</i>

620
01:13:17,561 --> 01:13:20,921
我会再为您制作一杯 cortado。
I will make you another cortado.

621
01:13:21,081 --> 01:13:24,761
不，我只是……
No, I just...

622
01:13:24,921 --> 01:13:29,161
- 关于烹饪。
- 不，不，不……
- About the cooking.
- No, no, no...

623
01:13:29,321 --> 01:13:33,681
这是加利西亚，
我们有西班牙最好的厨房。
This is Galicia,
and we have the finest kitchen in Spain.

624
01:13:33,841 --> 01:13:36,721
- 当然。
- 我妈妈是个很棒的厨师。
- Of course.
- My mother was a great cook.

625
01:13:36,881 --> 01:13:39,841
- 但她现在老了，好吗？
有点痴呆。
But she's old now, okay?
Has a bit of dementia.

626
01:13:40,001 --> 01:13:43,801
- 我们尽我们所能。
- 当然！
- We do the best we can.
- Of course!

627
01:13:43,961 --> 01:13:48,681
- 我只是想问你
我是否可以在厨房帮忙？
I just wanted to ask you
if I could help out in the kitchen?

628
01:13:49,761 --> 01:13:54,121
- 你呢？
- 是的，我会做饭。
- You?
- Yes, I can cook.

629
01:13:54,281 --> 01:13:59,441
我真的，真的需要做点什么。
And I really,
really need something to do.

630
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:03,001
她问，
她能不能帮忙做晚饭。
She asks,
if she can help cooking dinner.

631
01:14:03,161 --> 01:14:07,761
当然。吃淘气女孩做的晚餐真是一种享受。
Of course. It's a pleasure
eating dinner made by naughty girls.

632
01:14:07,921 --> 01:14:09,881
&lt;i>是吗？&lt;/i>
<i>Sí?</i>

633
01:14:10,041 --> 01:14:12,561
&lt;i>- 是，是。&lt;/i>
- 意思是“是”？
<i>- Sí, sí.</i>
- Means "yes"?

634
01:14:12,721 --> 01:14:15,081
&lt;i>谢谢，夫人！&lt;/i>
<i>Gracias, señora!</i>

635
01:14:15,241 --> 01:14:18,441
让我看看……
Let me see...

636
01:14:19,841 --> 01:14:26,361
我可以用&lt;i>火腿&lt;/i>做这些洋蓟吗？
I could make these artichokes
with the <i>jamón?</i>

637
01:14:26,521 --> 01:14:28,441
&lt;i>Alcachofas con Jamón.&lt;/i>
<i>Alcachofas con Jamón.</i>

638
01:14:28,601 --> 01:14:31,441
- 非常好。
- 很好。
- It's very good.
- It's fine.

639
01:14:55,681 --> 01:14:58,281
嗨。
Hi.

640
01:14:58,441 --> 01:15:02,001
给你。吃吧。
Here you go. Eat.

641
01:15:03,521 --> 01:15:07,761
不，我不想谈论它。
And no, I don't want to talk about it.

642
01:15:07,921 --> 01:15:10,921
吃你的食物。
Eat your food.

643
01:15:29,921 --> 01:15:36,441
你妈妈似乎
她有一个非常……大个性。
Your mother seems like
she has a very... big personality.

644
01:15:36,601 --> 01:15:39,241
你别说！
You don't say!

645
01:15:56,721 --> 01:16:01,961
事实上，今天是六周前
我母亲去世的日子。
It's actually six weeks ago today
that my mother died.

646
01:16:09,921 --> 01:16:14,841
他们消失的时候很奇怪。
It's strange when they disappear.

647
01:16:15,001 --> 01:16:19,281
他们一直在那里，
突然间他们就不见了。
They were always there,
and suddenly they're not.

648
01:16:23,961 --> 01:16:27,441
我其实开始有点想念她了。
I'm actually starting to miss her
a little bit.

649
01:16:30,921 --> 01:16:32,681
是的。
Yeah.

650
01:16:34,281 --> 01:16:38,521
我觉得自己是个非常冷漠的人 -
I felt like a really cold person -

651
01:16:38,681 --> 01:16:42,241
- 不想念她。
- not missing her.

652
01:16:42,401 --> 01:16:46,081
冷漠？你呢？
Cold? You?

653
01:16:46,241 --> 01:16:50,041
不，我不这么认为。
No, I don't think so.

654
01:16:51,161 --> 01:16:53,401
蒂托！
Tito!

655
01:16:53,561 --> 01:16:57,121
问女孩
是否想做饭。
Ask the girl
if she wants to prepare the food.

656
01:16:57,281 --> 01:17:02,241
我妈妈问你能否帮我们做晚饭？
My mother asks if you would be kind
and help us with dinner?

657
01:17:02,401 --> 01:17:06,681
是的，我很乐意！
Yeah, I would love to!

658
01:18:24,361 --> 01:18:28,961
- 脑震荡怎么样了？
- 头痛消失了。
- How's the concussion?
- The headache is gone.

659
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:33,081
- 我饿极了。
- 太好了。那就坐吧。
- And I'm starving.
- Great. Then take a seat.

660
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:59,081
- 我该接受吗？
- 是的。
- Should I take that?
- Yeah.

661
01:19:02,321 --> 01:19:07,801
- 食物很好吃。
- 不客气。
- The food was nice.
- You're welcome.

662
01:19:09,401 --> 01:19:12,401
我真不敢相信你……
I can't believe that you...

663
01:19:13,521 --> 01:19:16,241
我真不敢相信……
I can't believe...

664
01:19:16,401 --> 01:19:19,521
爸爸，快点。求你停下来。
Dad, come on. Please stop.

665
01:19:22,281 --> 01:19:26,441
你能不能别那么夸张？
Can you please turn down the drama?

666
01:19:55,281 --> 01:20:00,401
爸爸，我会自己想办法的。
Dad, I'll figure this out on my own.

667
01:20:00,561 --> 01:20:04,121
行吗？
All right?

668
01:20:04,281 --> 01:20:09,681
你知道，很多女性都是单身母亲。
Lots of women manage
as single mothers, you know.

669
01:20:09,841 --> 01:20:15,681
你知道你的母亲梦想有个孙子吗？
Did you know that your mother
dreamt of having a grandchild?

670
01:20:15,841 --> 01:20:19,041
想象一下，如果她能体验成为祖母的感觉。
Imagine if she could have experienced
becoming a grandmother.

671
01:20:21,081 --> 01:20:27,561
她对我们的关系感到很痛苦，
你和我相处得并不融洽 -
She was tormented by our relationship,
that you and I didn't get along -

672
01:20:27,721 --> 01:20:33,241
而且事情已经到了
我们不再见面的地步。
and that it had gotten to the point
where we stopped seeing each other.

673
01:20:36,841 --> 01:20:42,401
- 你还记得吗？
- 还记得什么？
- Do you even remember?
- Remember what?

674
01:20:46,241 --> 01:20:52,081
你不记得
我们为什么一点儿也没见过面吗？
You don't remember
why we haven't seen each other at all?

675
01:20:52,241 --> 01:20:55,401
你还记得你叫我什么吗？
Do you remember what you called me?

676
01:20:56,441 --> 01:20:58,521
嗯……
Well...

677
01:20:58,681 --> 01:21:02,961
你叫我——
You called me -

678
01:21:03,121 --> 01:21:07,441
——你一生中最失望的人。
- the disappointment of your life.

679
01:21:14,161 --> 01:21:17,481
——是的。
——是的。
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

680
01:21:17,641 --> 01:21:24,921
——我喝多了。
- 是的，你可能已经这样做了。
- I had a little too much to drink.
- Yeah, you probably had.

681
01:21:29,681 --> 01:21:35,161
你这么说并没有伤害到我。
It didn't hurt so much that you said it.

682
01:21:35,321 --> 01:21:40,601
更重要的是 -
It was more the fact -

683
01:21:40,761 --> 01:21:43,281
- 你真的是这个意思。
- that you really meant it.

684
01:21:44,721 --> 01:21:48,001
这就是你对我的感觉。
That's how you feel about me.

685
01:21:48,161 --> 01:21:51,761
我认为你太重视它了。
I think you gave it too much importance.

686
01:21:53,241 --> 01:21:59,361
这可能吗？
Is that even possible?
Can you give it too much importance?

687
01:22:00,601 --> 01:22:05,441
But, Gitze, look at you now.
You nourish people's bodies.

688
01:22:05,601 --> 01:22:07,761
Sure, but...

689
01:22:09,441 --> 01:22:14,921
- 你妈妈滋养了人们的灵魂。
- 我现在真的不需要你的赞美。
- Your mom nourished people's souls.
- I really don't need your praise now.

690
01:22:20,761 --> 01:22:24,761
但是，吉泽……
But, Gitze...

691
01:22:24,921 --> 01:22:31,321
我曾经确信自己是一个伟大的思想家。
I once had myself convinced
that I was a great thinker.

692
01:22:31,481 --> 01:22:38,761
我确信我会写出改变世界的重要书籍。
I was sure I was going to write
important books that changed the world.

693
01:22:38,921 --> 01:22:43,921
但我成为了一名高中老师。
你的祖父不尊重这一点。
But I became a high school teacher.
Your grandfather didn't respect that.

694
01:22:44,081 --> 01:22:49,161
我们每次在一起时，他都会嘲笑我。
He mocked me
every time we were together.

695
01:22:49,321 --> 01:22:54,601
并且让我知道
我是他最失望的人。
And made sure I knew that I was
his biggest disappointment.

696
01:22:54,761 --> 01:23:00,441
我觉得自己是个巨大的失败者。
I felt like a huge failure.

697
01:23:15,201 --> 01:23:18,721
这就是我的结局。
That's how I've ended up.

698
01:23:18,881 --> 01:23:24,201
一个可以炫耀
并引用克尔凯郭尔的人。
Someone who can show off
and cite Kierkegaard.

699
01:23:26,201 --> 01:23:30,001
好吧，这还是有点意义的。
Well, that's still something.

700
01:23:31,921 --> 01:23:35,961
无论如何，现在做任何事情都太晚了。
At any rate, it's too late
to do anything about it now.

701
01:23:42,081 --> 01:23:46,961
现在我终于把所有的失望都发泄在你身上了。
And now I've ended up throwing
all my disappointment at you.

702
01:23:47,121 --> 01:23:51,481
- 不行。
- 不行。
- That's not okay.
- No.

703
01:23:51,641 --> 01:23:54,921
而且我也喝太多了。
And I also drink too much.

704
01:23:55,081 --> 01:23:58,681
- 我搞过其他女人。
- 我不需要知道。
- I screwed other women.
- I don't need to know.

705
01:23:58,841 --> 01:24:04,241
- 你妈妈和海涅也搞过。
- 不，不，不！
- Your mother and Heine screwed too.
- No, no, no!

706
01:24:04,401 --> 01:24:08,521
是的。
Yeah.

707
01:24:12,481 --> 01:24:15,841
有悲伤和失落。
There are sorrows and losses.

708
01:24:17,641 --> 01:24:23,361
还有我们对彼此所做的事情的羞耻和内疚。
And there's the shame and guilt
about what we did to each other.

709
01:24:23,521 --> 01:24:28,521
上帝可能会治愈羞耻和内疚。
这就是你母亲会说的话。
Shame and guilt God may heal.
That's what your mother would claim.

710
01:24:30,601 --> 01:24:33,841
但悲伤和失落呢？
But sorrow and loss?

711
01:24:34,001 --> 01:24:38,321
现在我一个人承受着这一切。
I'm alone with that now.

712
01:25:18,761 --> 01:25:21,321
嗨。
Hi.

713
01:25:54,561 --> 01:25:57,681
- 谢谢你的音乐！
- 晚餐真棒。
- Thank you for the music!
- Great dinner.

714
01:25:57,841 --> 01:26:00,241
- 晚餐。
- 哦，是的。
- Dinner.
- Oh, yes.

715
01:26:00,401 --> 01:26:03,201
&lt;i>太棒了！真棒。&lt;/i>
<i>Bellissima! Buena.</i>

716
01:26:10,561 --> 01:26:14,361
每个人都能感受到你烹饪的快乐和热情。
Everybody can taste your joy
and passion for cooking.

717
01:26:14,521 --> 01:26:21,441
我不知道。
只是一些油和洋葱 -
I don't know.
It was just some oil and onions -

718
01:26:21,601 --> 01:26:26,201
- 你漂亮的蔬菜。
- your beautiful vegetables.

719
01:26:39,161 --> 01:26:42,521
是吗？
Yes?

720
01:26:47,921 --> 01:26:51,001
我怀孕了。
I'm pregnant.

721
01:26:53,161 --> 01:26:57,161
&lt;i>Embarazada。&lt;/i>
你怀孕了吗？
<i>Embarazada.</i>
You're with child?

722
01:26:57,321 --> 01:27:03,801
是的。没有父亲。
没有爸爸，但我怀了一个孩子。
Yes. There's no father.
There's no dad, but I'm with a baby.

723
01:27:03,961 --> 01:27:07,041
- 一个小的。
- 恭喜！
- A small one.
- Congratulations!

724
01:27:07,201 --> 01:27:12,801
谢谢。是的，我……
Thank you. Yeah, I'm...

725
01:27:12,961 --> 01:27:15,201
我很高兴。
I'm happy.

726
01:27:15,361 --> 01:27:18,961
我想。
I think.

727
01:27:22,481 --> 01:27:28,521
我有……我妈妈。
我得帮她上床睡觉……
I have... my mother.
I have to help her to bed...

728
01:27:28,681 --> 01:27:33,201
否则，
她会忘记上床睡觉……
Otherwise,
she forgets to go to bed and...

729
01:27:33,361 --> 01:27:40,641
我得在睡觉前摆好桌子准备早餐。
I have to lay the table for breakfast
and prepare before I go to bed.

730
01:27:49,801 --> 01:27:54,321
一个。
一个就好了。
One.
It would be great with a one.

731
01:27:54,481 --> 01:27:56,761
两个。
Two.

732
01:28:13,681 --> 01:28:16,521
我累了。
I'm tired.

733
01:28:16,681 --> 01:28:21,841
我们回家吧。
也许你的追求者可以开车送我们？
Let's go home.
Maybe your suitor could drive us?

734
01:28:22,001 --> 01:28:25,521
他不是我的追求者。
He's not my suitor.

735
01:28:28,401 --> 01:28:32,881
那我们为妈妈点的大教堂和蜡烛呢？
What about the cathedral
and candle we were lighting for Mom?

736
01:28:33,041 --> 01:28:36,841
去机场之前我们还有时间。
We have time
before going to the airport.

737
01:28:58,041 --> 01:29:01,001
第 11 天
DAY 11

738
01:29:01,161 --> 01:29:04,121
还剩 5 公里
5 kilometers to go

739
01:29:09,201 --> 01:29:13,161
- 大教堂很漂亮，不是吗？
- 是的，很漂亮。
- The cathedral is beautiful, no?
- Yeah, it's beautiful.

740
01:29:13,321 --> 01:29:16,481
太棒了！
It's amazing!

741
01:29:46,801 --> 01:29:49,281
你来吗？
Are you coming?

742
01:29:50,961 --> 01:29:55,441
实际上，我不来了。
Actually, I'm not.

743
01:29:55,601 --> 01:30:01,161
- 怎么了？
- 我再也看不到它了。
- What's wrong?
- I just don't see it anymore.

744
01:30:01,321 --> 01:30:03,121
看到了什么？
See what?

745
01:30:03,281 --> 01:30:05,921
我宁愿只是坐着
喝一杯咖啡。
I'd rather just sit
and drink a cup of coffee.

746
01:30:06,081 --> 01:30:11,441
这就是你妈妈和我
一直做的事。我们只是坐着。
That's what your mother and I
always did. We would just sit.

747
01:30:11,601 --> 01:30:18,241
喝咖啡，看着人们
和生活从我们身边经过。
Drink coffee and look at people
and life as it passed us by.

748
01:30:18,401 --> 01:30:24,161
- 我更愿意这样做。
- 我想带妈妈去。
- I'd much rather do that.
- I want to bring Mom.

749
01:30:24,321 --> 01:30:26,881
好的。
Okay.

750
01:30:35,121 --> 01:30:37,881
我的母亲。
My mother.

751
01:31:30,441 --> 01:31:34,121
- 你好！
- 哦，你好！
- Hello!
- Oh, hello!

752
01:31:34,281 --> 01:31:36,721
你去过大教堂吗？
You've been inside the cathedral yet?

753
01:31:36,881 --> 01:31:43,681
不，我一生中见过很多教堂和大教堂。
No, I've seen lots of churches
and cathedrals in my time.

754
01:31:43,841 --> 01:31:48,361
你是信徒还是建筑师？
You're a believer or an architect?

755
01:31:49,641 --> 01:31:52,081
谢谢！
Thanks!

756
01:31:55,921 --> 01:31:59,801
嗯，我妻子是个信徒。
她是个牧师。
Well, my wife was a believer.
She was a priest.

757
01:31:59,961 --> 01:32:02,881
或者牧师！
Or a minister!

758
01:32:04,361 --> 01:32:07,401
你呢？
And you?

759
01:32:07,561 --> 01:32:11,601
现在，我喝咖啡。
Right now, I'm a coffee drinker.

760
01:32:19,361 --> 01:32:22,681
你知道，萨格勒布有一座非常漂亮的大教堂。
We have a very beautiful cathedral
in Zagreb, you know.

761
01:32:24,801 --> 01:32:28,001
我没听说过。
I haven't heard about it.

762
01:32:29,561 --> 01:32:35,281
是的。如果你来萨格勒布——
Yeah. If you ever come to Zagreb -

763
01:32:35,441 --> 01:32:39,561
你应该给我打电话，
我会带你去的。
you should give me a call,
and I'll show it to you.

764
01:32:49,281 --> 01:32:53,841
- 这就是我们所做的，不是吗？
- 我们做什么？
- That's what we do, isn't it?
- What's what we do?

765
01:32:54,001 --> 01:32:59,401
我们喝咖啡。我们结识新朋友。
We drink coffee. We meet new people.

766
01:33:00,441 --> 01:33:04,281
我们继续前行。我们继续前进。
We walk on. We move on.

767
01:33:08,321 --> 01:33:11,241
好吧...再见！
Well... bye!

768
01:33:12,721 --> 01:33:15,601
再见。
Bye-bye.

769
01:33:48,561 --> 01:33:53,161
为一个活着的人点蜡烛有意义吗？
Does it make sense to light a candle
for a living person?

770
01:33:56,801 --> 01:34:00,961
你可以为失去的人点蜡烛 -
You can light a candle
for someone you have lost -

771
01:34:01,121 --> 01:34:05,641
- 或者为一个你希望好的人点蜡烛 -
- or for someone you wish well -

772
01:34:05,801 --> 01:34:09,561
- 为一个新生儿，为每个人。
- for a newborn child, for everybody.

773
01:34:16,561 --> 01:34:22,521
这是给我的孩子的。
这是给我父亲的。
This is for my baby.
This is for my father.

774
01:34:32,881 --> 01:34:35,601
你在哪里？
And where are you?

775
01:34:40,961 --> 01:34:43,841
我不知道。
I don't know.

776
01:34:54,681 --> 01:34:58,361
- 谢谢。
- 谢谢你照顾我。
- Thank you.
- Thank you for taking care of me.

777
01:34:58,521 --> 01:35:01,481
随时都可以，&lt;i>爸爸！&lt;/i>
Any time, <i>Papá!</i>

778
01:35:07,761 --> 01:35:11,121
所以... 是的。
So... yeah.

779
01:35:16,561 --> 01:35:20,961
对我来说，今年夏天能遇见你是件非常高兴的事。
For me, it was this summer's pleasure
to meet you.

780
01:35:21,121 --> 01:35:23,281
真的。
Really.

781
01:35:23,441 --> 01:35:25,721
对我来说也是。
For me too.

782
01:35:29,601 --> 01:35:33,601
是的。好吧，再见！
Yeah. Well, goodbye!

783
01:35:33,761 --> 01:35:38,241
你在做什么？
你不能就这样让他离开！
What are you doing?
You can't just let him leave!

784
01:35:38,401 --> 01:35:42,121
我告诉他我怀孕了。
这会让大多数男人失去兴趣。
I told him I'm pregnant.
It's a turn-off for most men.

785
01:35:42,281 --> 01:35:47,161
不，Gitze！你还只是个单身母亲
而且才刚刚开始。
No, Gitze! You're just a single mother
at a very early stage.

786
01:35:47,321 --> 01:35:52,041
如果你让他离开，那么你永远不知道会发生什么。
If you let him leave, then you'll
never know what this could be.

787
01:35:52,201 --> 01:35:56,281
听着，Gitze，现在就是现在。
突然间就太晚了。
Listen, Gitze, now is now.
And suddenly it's too late.

788
01:35:56,441 --> 01:35:59,321
你还好吗？
Are you okay?

789
01:36:03,241 --> 01:36:05,721
- 别看！
- 对。
- Don't look!
- Right.

790
01:36:14,601 --> 01:36:17,401
我……是因为……
I... It's because...

791
01:36:18,881 --> 01:36:23,881
我想再见到你。是的。
I'd like to see you again. Yeah.

792
01:36:25,361 --> 01:36:30,241
我想……更深入地了解你。
I'd like to... get to know you
a bit better.

793
01:36:32,481 --> 01:36:34,681
也许回来，你知道……
Maybe come back and, you know...

794
01:36:34,841 --> 01:36:37,321
做点吃的……
Make some food and...

795
01:36:38,801 --> 01:36:43,881
是的，看看我们会发生什么。
Yeah, see what happens with us.

796
01:36:46,961 --> 01:36:51,721
- 我知道。怀孕了。关掉。
- 不，不是那样。
- I know. Pregnant. Turn off.
- No, it's not that.

797
01:36:51,881 --> 01:36:54,121
我生命中不能有女人。
I cannot have a woman in my life.

798
01:36:54,281 --> 01:36:56,001
不是任何女人。
Not any woman.

799
01:36:57,641 --> 01:37:02,161
哦，你喜欢男人，或者……
Oh, you like men, or...

800
01:37:02,321 --> 01:37:06,161
不，我已经承诺
进入萨摩斯修道院 -
No, I've made a commitment
to enter the Monastery of Samos -

801
01:37:06,321 --> 01:37:08,801
- 八月一日。
- on the 1st of August.

802
01:37:11,241 --> 01:37:14,641
什么？为什么？
What? Why?

803
01:37:17,201 --> 01:37:20,561
- 因为我相信上帝。
- 是的。
- Because I believe in God.
- Yeah.

804
01:37:20,721 --> 01:37:27,201
- 萨摩斯修道院是最大的。
- 我知道。我去过那里。
- The Monastery of Samos is the biggest.
- I know. I was there.

805
01:37:27,361 --> 01:37:34,241
如果有帮助的话，当我遇到你时，我真的不得不再次问自己。
If it helps, I really had to question
myself again when I met you.

806
01:37:34,401 --> 01:37:40,041
- 真的。
- 这有点帮助。
- Really.
- That helps, a little.

807
01:37:41,881 --> 01:37:44,961
我很抱歉，也为我自己。
I'm so sorry, also for myself.

808
01:37:46,921 --> 01:37:52,121
你去做你必须做的事。
You go do what you have to do.

809
01:37:53,601 --> 01:38:00,321
如果你和上帝分手了
那么请给我打电话。
And if you and God ever break up
at some point, then call me.

810
01:38:00,481 --> 01:38:05,881
你将是我第一个打电话的人。
而我妈妈将是第二个。
You will be the first I call.
And my mother will be number two.

811
01:38:06,041 --> 01:38:11,081
好吧，但我是认真的。
Okay, but I'm serious.

812
01:38:11,241 --> 01:38:14,321
我也是。
I am too.

813
01:38:15,561 --> 01:38:17,521
好的。
Okay.

814
01:38:23,001 --> 01:38:26,361
谢谢！
Thank you!

815
01:38:35,401 --> 01:38:40,801
为什么要当和尚？真是个白痴，
他本可以拥有像你这样的人。
Why be a monk? What an idiot,
when he could have had someone like you.

816
01:38:43,801 --> 01:38:48,961
这是夸奖吗？
Was that a compliment?

817
01:38:55,121 --> 01:38:57,601
如果你能为 100 个人做饭 -
If you can cook for 100 people -

818
01:38:57,761 --> 01:39:03,841
- 你肯定能照顾好一个孩子。
- you can surely handle a single child.

819
01:39:10,361 --> 01:39:14,761
而且父亲那边没有祖父母。
And there are no grandparents
on the father's side.

820
01:39:16,241 --> 01:39:20,081
母亲那边也没有祖母。
And no grandmother on the mother's.

821
01:39:22,321 --> 01:39:28,561
但肯定有爷爷。
But there sure as hell is a grandpa.

822
01:39:37,561 --> 01:39:41,401
或者某种爷爷，如果你想要的话。
Or a kind of grandpa, if you want it.

823
01:39:52,641 --> 01:39:57,561
我哭的时候别看我。
我看起来像一只小兔子。
Don't look at me when I cry.
I look like a little rabbit.

824
01:40:06,241 --> 01:40:10,721
- 这还不算太糟？
- 味道糟透了！
- This isn't too bad?
- It tastes awful!

825

368
00:43:27,881 --> 00:43:31,281
- 这是一次美丽的朝圣之旅。
- 也许我会的。
