00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,590
真的吗 对
{\fs10\b0}Yeah? Yeah.{\r}

122
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:23,950
这里
{\fs10\b0}So that bit there...{\r}

123
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,839
亲爱的 你好

124
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,719
最近怎么样 我很好

125
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,799
但是... 真的好吗

126
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:43,879
嗯 我没事

127
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,879
对 我没事

128
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,959
还是在假装没事

129
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,359
这我也不太确定

130
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,559
你相信他说的话吗

131
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,439
现在我只能选择相信

132
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,070
努里
{\fs10\b0}Nuri...{\r}

133
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,799
你弟弟有事想问你

134
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,710
你是怎么看出来的
{\fs10\b0}And how could you tell?{\r}

135
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,070
大概要上去看看才知道
{\fs10\b0}U...Probably by getting up there and having a look.{\r}

136
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,550
但这根本没解释清楚
{\fs10\b0}But this isn't even trying to explain it, so...{\r}

137
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,270
我可以带你去
{\fs10\b0}Well, I could take you.{\r}

138
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,790
看看
{\fs10\b0}Have a look.{\r}

139
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,590
真的吗 嗯
{\fs10\b0}Really? Mm.{\r}

140
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:27,230
不过得今天下午去
{\fs10\b0}It would have to be this afternoon, though.{\r}

141
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:30,470
今晚有演出 整个场地都会封锁
{\fs10\b0}There's a concert tonight and they'll shut the whole place down.{\r}

142
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,270
完全封闭 这是怎么回事
{\fs10\b0}Like, total lockdown. What's that about?{\r}

143
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:36,110
我不知道 他们只是告诉我们今晚之后
{\fs10\b0}I dunno, they just told us that after tonight{\r}

144
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,750
没有特别许可谁都不能进出
{\fs10\b0}no-one's getting in or out without special permission.{\r}

145
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,950
他们让我今晚就走
{\fs10\b0}Well, they've got me leaving this evening now, so,{\r}

146
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:46,030
所以如果可以的话我能下午去
{\fs10\b0}I could do this afternoon, if that works?{\r}

147
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,990
你能让这趟值得吗
{\fs10\b0}Would you make it worth my while?{\r}

148
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,159
你知道里面有多少钱吗

149
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,639
不知道 也不想知道

150
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,199
让我告诉你

151
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,959
你父亲在世的时候

152
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,910
我总是清楚他有多少钱 分毫不差

153
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:11,559
我总是清楚他有多少钱 分毫不差

154
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:11,560


155
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,430
这才叫婚姻

156
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,119
这才叫婚姻

157
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,470


158
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,879
我问这个是因为对我很重要 是个不想错过的机会

159
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,439
还记得我朋友安东尼奥吗 就是市中心开酒吧那个

160
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,359
他想转让酒吧 不是全部 只是一半

161
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,599
他想让我买下来

162
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,959
我必须在周五前筹到钱 否则他就会卖给第一个愿意买的人

163
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,519
要四万块

164
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,719
这可是加的斯市中心的酒吧

165
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,839
这会改变你弟弟的人生

166
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,319
你自己决定吧

167
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,839
谢谢 让开

168
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,439
亲爱的 别担心

169
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,759
你是在给他一个机会

170
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,599
帮助他人最是美好

171
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,279
不用说我也知道

172
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,839
这让我很开心

173
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,879
我为你感到骄傲

174
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,799
你真是不要脸

175
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,510
一切都还好吗
{\fs10\b0}Everything OK?{\r}

176
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,630
嗯 还好
{\fs10\b0}Yeah.{\r}

177
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,550
我们都很好
{\fs10\b0}We're all good. Hm.{\r}

178
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,599
四万块

179
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,759
我一定会还查尔斯每一分钱的

180
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:52,879
让开

181
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:21,950
大家好

182
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:22,719
嘿 拉斯姆斯
大家好
{\fs10\b0}Hey, Rasmus!{\r}

183
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:24,470
嘿 拉斯姆斯
{\fs10\b0}Hey, Rasmus!{\r}

184
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,230
还好今晚不用值班
{\fs10\b0}Fuck, I'm glad I'm not working tonight.{\r}

185
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:29,150
想象一下要坐三个小时听古典钢琴
{\fs10\b0}Imagine having to sit through three hours of classical piano.{\r}

186
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:32,350
真是难以想象
{\fs10\b0}Imagine.{\r}

187
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:37,670
那么 我就在这等你了
{\fs10\b0}So, um... I'll just wait for you.{\r}

188
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:40,670
用这个进来就行 随意点
{\fs10\b0}Use this to get back in here. Knock yourself out.{\r}

189
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,830
拉斯姆斯
{\fs10\b0}Rasmus?{\r}

190
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:07,070
嘿 感觉如何 你根本不知道刚才演奏的是什么
{\fs10\b0}Hey, how was that? You have no idea what that was.{\r}

191
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:10,310
那真是太精彩了
{\fs10\b0}That was, uh... that was pretty extraordinary.{\r}

192
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:13,030
什么
{\fs10\b0}What?{\r}

193
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:16,430
不 你看起来特别开心 真有意思
{\fs10\b0}No, you're just so happy about it. It's hilarious.{\r}

194
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,710
对我来说 这真的是件大事
{\fs10\b0}That, for me, that was... that was a big thing.{\r}

195
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,110
对
{\fs10\b0}Right.{\r}

196
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,430
谢谢
{\fs10\b0}Thank you.{\r}

197
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,830
不用谢
{\fs10\b0}No problem.{\r}

198
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,830
要去吃点东西吗
{\fs10\b0}Do you wanna grab some food?{\r}

199
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:27,190
我很想去 但飞机起飞前
{\fs10\b0}I'd love that, but I've got a ton of things I've gotta do{\r}

200
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:28,710
还有很多事要做
{\fs10\b0}before I fly, so...{\r}

201
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,910
等我来取东西时再见吧
{\fs10\b0}But I'll see you when I come and pick up my stuff?{\r}

202
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,270
好啊 行吗

{\fs10\b0}Yeah. Yeah.{\r}

205
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,750
我已经和UDC的安保主管
{\fs10\b0}I've established a line of communication{\r}

206
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,550
基思·坎维建立了联系
{\fs10\b0}with Keith Canvey, UDC's head of security.{\r}

207
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,150
我已经把画像发给他了
{\fs10\b0}I've sent him the facial composite.{\r}

208
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,550
但他基本上什么都不愿透露
{\fs10\b0}But basically he won't share anything with us.{\r}

209
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:51,190
连UDC要来塔林都不承认
{\fs10\b0}He's not even admitting UDC's coming to Tallinn.{\r}

210
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,510
奥斯卡·伊尔维斯找你 奥西 开扬声器

{\fs10\b0}Oskar, hi. It's Osi.{\r}

212
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,670
嗨 有个警察认出了画像上的人
{\fs10\b0}'Hi. We have a police officer who recognises the facial composite.{\r}

213
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:03,750
昨晚她在一家爱彼迎见过这个人
{\fs10\b0}She talked to the guy last night at an Airbnb.{\r}

214
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,790
是个英国人 叫彼得·吉布森 我正在赶往现场
{\fs10\b0}British. Name of Peter Gibson. I'm on my way to the location now.'{\r}

215

219
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,910
我找到爱彼迎的位置了
{\fs10\b0}I've got the Airbnb location.{\r}

220
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:33,990
不 快趴下
{\fs10\b0}No! Down, down!{\r}

221
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,510
跟我来 快
{\fs10\b0}On me! Now!{\r}

222
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,990
他直接瞄准你 这是暗杀
{\fs10\b0}He aimed straight at you. That was a fucking hit.{\r}

223
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,630
你还好吗 嗯
{\fs10\b0}Are you OK? Yeah.{\r}

224
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,510
要进来吗
{\fs10\b0}Do you need to come inside?{\r}

225
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,790
不 不用 我们得走了
{\fs10\b0}N-No. No, uh... we need to go.{\r}

226
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,630
我们得走 走吧 警察的事我来处理
{\fs10\b0}We need to go. Go. I'll deal with the police.{\r}

227
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,470
嘿 嘿 嘿
{\fs10\b0}Hey. Hey, hey.{\r}

228
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,510
小心点
{\fs10\b0}Be careful.{\r}

229
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,510
你没事吧
{\fs10\b0}You OK?{\r}

230
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,110
差一点就中弹了
{\fs10\b0}He didn't miss by much.{\r}

231
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,230
是啊 蠢货
{\fs10\b0}Yeah... Idiot.{\r}

232
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,110
奥斯卡·伊尔维斯 内务安全局
{\fs10\b0}Oskar Ilves, Internal Security.{\r}

233
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,790
知道嫌犯在里面吗 还不确定
{\fs10\b0}Do you know if our guy's in there? We don't,{\r}

234
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,790
但昨晚他确实在这里
{\fs10\b0}but he was definitely there last night.{\r}

235
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,830
所有出口都已封锁 好
{\fs10\b0}We've covered all the exits. OK.{\r}

236
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,670
内务安全局 开门

{\fs10\b0}You OK? Uh... Yeah, I had some dodgy sushi.{\r}

241
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,040
希望这些药能让我在飞机起飞前好起来
{\fs10\b0}I'm hoping these'll bung me up before the flight.{\r}

242
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,200
信息量太大了
{\fs10\b0}Too much information.{\r}

243
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,640
好吧
{\fs10\b0}Right...{\r}

244
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,960
这段时间很开心
{\fs10\b0}It's been fun.{\r}

245
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,880
不止是开心
{\fs10\b0}It's been more than fun.{\r}

246
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,680
拉斯姆斯 你看起来很善良
{\fs10\b0}You got a good-man face, Rasmus.{\r}

247
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,000
这是什么意思
{\fs10\b0}What does that mean?{\r}

248
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,520
善良好像是你与生俱来的特质
{\fs10\b0}Kindness just seems to come off you naturally.{\r}

249
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,560
大概我天性就是个快乐的人吧
{\fs10\b0}Guess I'm just a happy person.{\r}

250
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,120
UDC和DagHaus对即将发布的河流项目
{\fs10\b0}'Both UDC and DagHaus have remained tight-lipped{\r}

251
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,880
依然守口如瓶
{\fs10\b0}with regards to the upcoming announcement of River.{\r}

252
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,720

{\fs10\b0}The venues in Dublin, Dubai and Kuala Lumpur{\r}

253
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,440
都被传言可能是发布地点
{\fs10\b0}have all been rumoured as possible locations.{\r}

254
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,840
UDC已经制造了不小的轰动
{\fs10\b0}UDC has created quite a stir already{\r}

255
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,040
暗示其最新发明河流的惊人功能
{\fs10\b0}with hints to what his latest invention, River, can do.'{\r}

256
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,440
UDC 保佑他那尖尖的小脑袋
{\fs10\b0}UDC, bless his pointy little head,{\r}

257
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,040

{\fs10\b0}hasn't got the memo that class hatred...{\r}

258
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,800
现在比以往任何时候
{\fs10\b0}...makes no more sense now,{\r}

259
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,560
更没有意义 世界需要团结一致
{\fs10\b0}just when the world needs to pull together, than it ever did.{\r}

260
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,880
塔林的行动失败了
{\fs10\b0}It didn't happen. In Tallinn.{\r}

261
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,280

{\fs10\b0}It was a couple of Russians. They botched it.{\r}

262
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,920
共产主义结束这么多年 俄罗斯人还是醉醺醺的
{\fs10\b0}Years after Communism, Russians are still drunk,{\r}

263
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,120
懒惰 无能 腐败的农民
{\fs10\b0}lazy, inept, corrupt peasants.{\r}

264
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,720
民族特性总是能在政权更迭后存活下来
{\fs10\b0}National characteristics always outlive regime change.{\r}

265
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,280
时间太紧了 蒂姆
{\fs10\b0}It was very short notice, Tim.{\r}

266
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,400
你知道 当罗马人找不到足够的罗马公民
{\fs10\b0}Do you know, when the Romans could no longer find enough Romans{\r}

267
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,400
来管理他们的帝国 史上最伟大的帝国
{\fs10\b0}to run their empire, Greatest empire the world has ever known,{\r}

268
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,240
他们就开始雇佣外国人
{\fs10\b0}they started hiring foreigners.{\r}

269
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,200
结果大家都知道了 衰落和灭亡
{\fs10\b0}The rest is history. Decline and fall.{\r}

270
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,520
你明白我的意思吗
{\fs10\b0}Do you understand what I'm saying?{\r}

271
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,240
不要用外国人
{\fs10\b0}No foreigners.{\r}

272
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,800
嗯
{\fs10\b0}Mmm.{\r}

273
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,520
告诉莱诺拉 我们喜欢考夫林的阶级仇恨论调
{\fs10\b0}You tell Leonora we like Coughlin's class hatred line.{\r}

274
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,720
这是科赫瓦警官 她确定昨晚看到了你说的人
{\fs10\b0}This is Officer Kohver. She's sure she saw your man last night.{\r}

275
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,360
我们在处理这栋楼的入室盗窃案
{\fs10\b0}We were responding to a burglary in the building.{\r}

276
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,240
和这层楼的几个租户都谈过
{\fs10\b0}We spoke to a number of tenants on this floor.{\r}

其中有一个男人
{\fs10\b0}And one man,{\r}

278

他有些特别 看起来很像这个画像
{\fs10\b0}there was something about him, and he looked a lot like this.{\r}

279
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,800
晚上好

{\fs10\b0}Could I see your bag, sir?{\r}

281
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,480
噢 可能是靴子的声音
{\fs10\b0}Oh. It's probably the boot.{\r}

282
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,160

{\fs10\b0}He had a British passport in the name of Peter Gibson.{\r}

285
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,240

{\fs10\b0}How did Gibson pay? Credit card.{\r}

286

{\fs10\b0}We're checking to see if the card has been used.{\r}

{\fs10\b0}How accurate is this? A local policewoman had eyes on him,{\r}

322
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,920
就跟我跟你一样近
{\fs10\b0}as close as I am to you,{\r}

323
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,160

329
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,720
这个可能帮助不大
{\fs10\b0}Maybe not so helpful, eh?{\r}

330
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,760
我看起来怎么样？
{\fs10\b0}How do I look?{\r}

331
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,240

{\fs10\b0}The Jackal left this behind.{\r}

338
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,360
上面可能留有他的气味
{\fs10\b0}Hm. It could have his scent on it.{\r}

339
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:36,000

{\fs10\b0}Now, what does that mean?{\r}

350
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,160
在西班牙我们说 宁缺毋滥
{\fs10\b0}We say in Spain, better alone than in bad company.{\r}

351
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,880

{\fs10\b0}'Markets and trading floors across the world in chaos.'{\r}

375
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:35,590

瑞玛 嘿
{\fs10\b0}Rima! Hey!{\r}

408
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:22,790
我面前的是这个星球上最幸运的人群 对吧
{\fs10\b0}Am I looking at the luckiest people on the planet, or what?{\r}

409
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:27,510
不仅最聪明
{\fs10\b0}Not only the most intelligent,{\r}

410
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,590
衣着最讲究 还有嗯
{\fs10\b0}the best dressed, and uh...{\r}

411
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:31,870
可能是最帅最美的
{\fs10\b0}possibly even the best looking...{\r}

412
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:35,790
而且绝对是最幸运的
{\fs10\b0}...but definitely the luckiest.{\r}

413
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:38,750
因为你们正在见证历史
{\fs10\b0}Because you are witnessing history,{\r}

{\fs10\b0}I'll let you in on a little secret.{\r}

416
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:29,110
我们所知的这个世界
{\fs10\b0}The world as we know it...{\r}

417
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:31,230
已经注定毁灭
{\fs10\b0}'..is doomed.'{\r}

418
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,070
对 显然我们完蛋了
{\fs10\b0}Yep. Apparently we're doomed.{\r}

419
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:35,310
我听到了 没错 暖场表演
{\fs10\b0}I heard. 'Yeah, I know. The warm up act{\r}

420
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:38,390
应该让你们热情高涨 而不是吓得魂飞魄散
{\fs10\b0}is supposed to warm you up, not scare the shit out of you.{\r}

421
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,270
但是拜托 我可是夸奖过你们
{\fs10\b0}But come on, I flattered you.'{\r}

422
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:43,950
她太酷了 我们需要认真谈谈
{\fs10\b0}She's so cool. 'We need to have a serious talk.{\r}

423
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:47,590
我说的是你们 还有全世界数百万
{\fs10\b0}I mean you, and I mean the millions of people watching this{\r}

424
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:49,870
正在手机和电视前观看的人们
{\fs10\b0}on their phones and TVs around the world.'{\r}

425
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:52,310
我们中的一些人
{\fs10\b0}Some of us,{\r}

426
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:55,190
不 是大多数人 都拥有很多东西
{\fs10\b0}no, most of us, have loads of stuff.{\r}

427
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:59,790
我们又不是在排队领救济餐 对吧
{\fs10\b0}Well, we're not exactly lining up at the soup kitchens, are we?{\r}

428
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:03,030
不要为此感到羞愧 但拥有东西
{\fs10\b0}Don't be embarrassed about it. But just because we have stuff,{\r}

429
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,990
并不意味着我们没完蛋
{\fs10\b0}doesn't mean we're not fucked.{\r}

430
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:07,670
我们在自欺欺人
{\fs10\b0}We're in denial.{\r}

431
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:10,150
我们一直假装没有坏事
{\fs10\b0}We keep pretending nothing bad{\r}

432
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:12,630
发生 但我们心知肚明
{\fs10\b0}is happening when we know it is.{\r}

433
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,670
来 跟我重复
{\fs10\b0}Come on, repeat after me.{\r}

434
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:17,310
我们完蛋了 我们完蛋了
{\fs10\b0}We're fucked! We're fucked!{\r}

435
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:19,270
我们必须改变 我们都知道
{\fs10\b0}We have to change, and we know it.{\r}

436
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:21,870
这种改变必须从金钱开始
{\fs10\b0}And that change has to start with money,{\r}

437
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,430
因为金钱就是权力
{\fs10\b0}because money equals power.{\r}

438
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:26,910
权力何时愿意过改变
{\fs10\b0}And when has power ever wanted change?{\r}

439
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:31,190
改变对有权力的人来说就像氪石 他们会
{\fs10\b0}Change is like kryptonite for people with power. They go all...{\r}

440
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:33,950
啊
{\fs10\b0}'Urgh...'{\r}

441
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:35,710
这是谁
{\fs10\b0}Who is this?{\r}

442
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:37,470
她什么都不是
{\fs10\b0}She's nobody.{\r}

443
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:39,590
一百年前 女性要求
{\fs10\b0}'A hundred years ago, women said...{\r}

444
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,910
给我们投票权
{\fs10\b0}give us the vote.{\r}

445
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:45,430
当权者说 不行 那会毁了这个世界
{\fs10\b0}Power went, "No, that would be the end of the world.'{\r}

446
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:48,190
救济穷人 不行 你们不能这样做
{\fs10\b0}Feed the poor. No, you can't do that.{\r}

447
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:50,630
穷人永远都会存在
{\fs10\b0}The poor will always be with us!{\r}

448
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:54,310
权力不会轻易放手 永远不会投降
{\fs10\b0}Power won't give up. It will never surrender.{\r}

449
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,390
必须用强制手段
{\fs10\b0}It has to be forced.{\r}

450
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:59,910
而这位就是
{\fs10\b0}And here is the man...{\r}

451
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:03,070
能做到这一点的人 女士们 先生们
{\fs10\b0}...to do it. Ladies, gentlemen,{\r}

452
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:05,270
还有在座的所有人
{\fs10\b0}and all of you in between,{\r}

453
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:07,870
我向大家介绍 乌勒

455
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,150
喔
{\fs10\b0}Woo!{\r}

456
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:46,630
耶 耶
{\fs10\b0}Yeah! Yeah!{\r}

457
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:49,430
就像格拉斯顿伯里音乐节的主舞台
{\fs10\b0}That is like the main stage at Glastonbury.{\r}

458
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:52,070
嗯 别这样
{\fs10\b0}Mmm... Stop it.{\r}

459
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:56,150
他们说我们不会成功 但我们做到了
{\fs10\b0}'They said we'd never make it, but we're here!'{\r}

460
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,910

{\fs10\b0}Friends, thank you for joining me here tonight.{\r}

464
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:12,550

{\fs10\b0}I know you've all come a long way.{\r}

465
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:16,430
现在我要请你们

466
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:18,670
走得更远
{\fs10\b0}to come even further.{\r}

467
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:21,670
我希望你们
{\fs10\b0}I want you...{\r}

468
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:26,270
能和我一起踏上征程
{\fs10\b0}'..to come on a journey with me.'{\r}

469
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:28,390
我跟你去
{\fs10\b0}I'll come!{\r}

470
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:30,070
我实话实说
{\fs10\b0}I won't lie to you,{\r}

471
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:32,710
这不会是一段轻松的旅程
{\fs10\b0}the journey will not be an easy one to make.{\r}

472
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:36,110
有些人需要放弃一些东西
{\fs10\b0}For some, it will involve giving up stuff,{\r}

473
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:38,150
正如丽玛所说
{\fs10\b0}like Rima said.{\r}

474
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:43,070
但这必须要做
{\fs10\b0}But it has to be done.{\r}

475
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,670
必须要做
{\fs10\b0}It has to be done!{\r}

476
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:50,230
富人
{\fs10\b0}The rich...{\r}

477
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,870
变得如此富有
{\fs10\b0}'have become so rich...'{\r}

478
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:53,270
他真让人恶心
{\fs10\b0}He's nauseating.{\r}

479
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:56,430
权贵变得如此强大
{\fs10\b0}'..the powerful have become so powerful,{\r}

480
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:59,830
腐败分子变得如此堕落
{\fs10\b0}the corrupt have become so corrupt.{\r}

481
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:03,470
这些富有 腐败和强大的人
{\fs10\b0}'The rich, corrupt, and powerful...'{\r}

482
