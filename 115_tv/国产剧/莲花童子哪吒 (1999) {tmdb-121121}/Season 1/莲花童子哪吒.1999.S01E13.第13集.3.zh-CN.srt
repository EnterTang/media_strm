1
00:00:02,902 --> 00:00:07,965
lt's important that you realize
sonograms are by no means an exact science.

2
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:11,374
l don't want to alarm you
or have you jump to conclusions,

3
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:14,902
because it's not something
we're perfectly able to explain.

4
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,108
But l don't see anything.

5
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:20,516
As l said, we may be
premature in the diagnosis.

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,020
lt may simply be...

7
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:26,058
an intermediate stage of growth.

8
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:28,253
But there's a problem.

9
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:31,089
We see a development.

10
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:35,292
An abnormal bony formation
involving the upper vertebrae

11
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:38,860
and something growing here
on the plates of the skull.

12
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:43,138
Wayne?

13
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:53,144
Sweetness?

14
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,950
lt might be nothing.

15
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:05,254
l'm serious. Dr Couvillion
really just wants to wait and see.

16
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:12,303
l just... want it to be normal.

17
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:15,605
Wayne.

18
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,878
Let's go home, OK?

19
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,472
Come on.

20
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:56,315
Thank you.

21
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:13,823
l love you, Laura.

22
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:17,661
No matter what.

23
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:21,198
You know that?

24
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,100
Poopydoo?

25
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:28,205
l know.

26
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,678
Good night, Wayne.

27
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,448
Good night, Laura.

28
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,720
Sweet dreams.

29
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:09,581
Wayne!

30
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,690
Wayne!

31
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,860
Please!

32
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:19,992
What are you doing?

33
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:24,259
Stop it!

34
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,998
Wayne! Where are you?!

35
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:35,075
Stop him! Please don't take my baby!

36
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,112
Please don't take my baby!

37
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,915
Wayne!

38
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:44,080
- Wayne!
- Laura?

39
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:48,217
- My baby!
- Laura, it's OK. You're having a dream.

40
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,628
- lt was terrible.
- lt's OK.

41
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:01,704
lt was... trying to steal our baby.

42
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:14,280
lt's not the kind of case where l quite
know where to turn, you understand.

43
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,008
lt's not the kind of case where l quite
know where to turn, you understand.

44
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:18,744
Down in Hollins,
we do get our share of the oddball.

45
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,810
But we're pretty much
like any other little town.

46
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:26,450
You got your home break-ins,
your smash-and-grabs. Nothing too wild.

47
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:33,432
But given the victim's statement,
the unusually vivid detail...

48
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:38,163
Well, l just had to take Laura's word
about her baby being abducted.

49
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:44,198
- l hear you specialize in this kind of case.
- You've come to the right place, Deputy...

50
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:48,008
Stevens. Now, this woman making
these claims, she's your sister?

51
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:53,576
Yes, sir. Laura Weinsider. l've heard about the
things people have been saying about her.

52
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,917
Not to my face, of course, but...

53
00:05:56,022 --> 00:06:00,925
real mean and awful things
about what Laura's part is in all this.

54
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:05,760
lt says here a doctor's report the day before
revealed abnormalities in the ultrasound.

55
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:10,132
Yes, sir, that is true,
but nothing conclusive, mind you.

56
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,433
l see.

57
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:17,669
OK, Deputy. We're gonna put this
right into our priority caseload.

58
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:23,647
l really wanna thank you. Laura's itching
to talk to somebody who'll really listen to her.

59
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:56,112
lt went right into your caseload but l never
imagined you'd get here so soon, Agent...

60
00:06:56,215 --> 00:07:00,311
Mulder, Fox Mulder. Though l ask you
not to make that known to anybody.

61
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,617
The FBl likes to keep our work
on these cases very hush-hush.

62
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:07,124
Sure, of course.
But l would like to thank Agent Spender.

63
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:09,388
No, no, no. l'll...

64
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:13,023
l'll thank him for you cos
l have to call in my progress report.

65
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:16,932
- l hope you have something to call in.
- Me too. All right.

66
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:30,378
l kept calling it a nightmare, but how
many people's nightmares come true?

67
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,543
Not many.

68
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,687
Certainly not in the way yours did,
Mrs Weinsider.

69
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,848
When l was having it...

70
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:43,157
itjust seemed so real.

71
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:48,997
You mentioned a fire in the room
in your account and a...

72
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:53,195
a devil that held your legs?

73
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:55,672
So that it could take the baby.

74
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:59,768
But according to your statement,
your baby was not a normal baby.

75
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:03,407
No. lt was some kind of monster...

76
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:08,050
with horns and a tail.

77
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,917
Can you excuse me, please?

78
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:24,268
My wife appears so resilient,
but l know she's suffered

79
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,965
ever since the doctor
told us about the complications.

80
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:37,249
You were right there in bed with your wife
the whole time, Mr Weinsider?

81
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,250
Wayne. Yes, l woke her up.

82
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:43,618
But according to your wife's statement,

83
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:48,092
at one point, she reached
over for you in the bed

84
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,958
and you weren't there.

85
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:56,065
- Well, it was a dream.
- Yeah.

86
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:00,795
Mind if l use your phone... Wayne?

87
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:03,965
Sure, of course.

88
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:10,043
Your truthfulness is important,
and as a prospective federal employee,

89
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:14,381
l will remind you to answer
as honestly as possible. OK?

90
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:16,989
Sure. Fire away.

91
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:19,920
Do you or have you ever smoked marijuana?

92
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:22,517
No. No, sirree.

93
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:29,433
Have you consorted with people
who have, now or in the past?

94
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,768
No. l really don't think so.

95
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,250
- Scully.
- Hey, Scully, it's me.

96
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:49,548
Would you mind?

97
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:53,490
Mulder, where are you?
l waited 45 minutes for you this morning.

98
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:58,087
Before l tell you, l'm gonna
ask you to keep an open mind.

99
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:01,226
- Not an X-File?
- Call it what you like.

100
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,269
ln Roanoke, they're calling it
a demon baby-snatching.

101
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,828
- You're in Virginia?
- l want you to look at this woman's charts.

102
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:12,105
Strange in utero deformities were detected.
l'll courier them to you.

103
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:17,274
Mulder, we are supposed to be doing
background checks, not chasing X-Files.

104
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,977
Look, Spenderjust round-filed this case.

105
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:23,886
- lt's unconscionable.
- What do you call rooting through his trash?

106
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,390
That's like the assignment we're stuck with.

107
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,486
We, Mulder? l'm stuck with! You're not here!

108
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:34,032
Scully, this is a classic case
of demon fetal harvest.

109
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,898
What they called in the Middle Ages
''atum nocturnem.''

110
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:40,996
The impregnation of an unwitting woman
by a dark lord of the underworld.

111
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:43,303
As host for his demon seed.

112
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,502
Exactly.

113
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,113
l saw Rosemary's Baby on cable.

114
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:52,116
This is the real deal.
Check her charts, you'll get hard evidence.

115
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:55,244
Check her prenatal ultrasound.
Just humor me, Scully.

116
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:59,848
Take a look at those medical records.
l think they'll prove my theory.

117
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:11,601
Wayne, have you seen my nightgown?

118
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:14,697
l can't find...

119
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,375
Wayne?

120
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:29,179
Wayne?

121
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,858
Wayne!

122
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,841
Wayne?

123
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,999
Laura? What are you doing?

124
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:57,042
- What are you doing?
- Burning leaves.

125
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,079
At this time of night?

126
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,615
You asked me to rake up the yard.

127
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,974
lt was in the job jar.

128
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:12,216
Hey, come on. You're making me feel weird.

129
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:19,061
- Come to bed, Wayne, please.
- l will, honey. l just wanted...

130
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:25,761
l just wanted everything to look perfect
when you woke up. l'll be right in.

131
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,890
- Mulder.
- l think l found what you're looking for.

132
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,027
l've been up all night going over
the medical charts on the Weinsider baby.

133
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,604
What'd you find?

134
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:39,110
The prenatal birth defects that you spoke of -
they're all here, but they're subtle.

135
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:43,382
- Describe them to me.
- They look to be discrete bony deformities.

136
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:43,677
- Describe them to me.
- They look to be discrete bony deformities.

137
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:47,218
There are spurs on
the superior aspect of the scapula

138
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:51,450
and small protuberances on the skull
adjacent to the coronal suture.

139
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:56,586
- Protuberances? You mean like horns?
- They could be recessive characteristics,

140
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:59,631
expressed as vestiges
of primitive morphology,

141
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:03,566
or a developmental anomaly
like craniosynostosis.

142
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:06,161
Do you think it could be
passed along by the father?

143
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:11,232
l wouldn't look to the father as any kind of
dark force here. l think it's the mother.

144
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:16,440
Virginia law on third-trimester abortions
requires you to put her under arrest.

145
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:19,574
- What are you talking about?
- Labor was induced.

146
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:24,749
ln the mother's blood was a significant
trace of an herb called mandrake.

147
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:28,190
lt's a poison that's been known
to facilitate self-abortion.

148
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,284
Mandrake?

149
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:32,296
lt's also been known
to be used as a hallucinogenic.

150
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,992
You think Mrs Weinsider self-prescribed?

151
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:40,562
l called the doctor on a hunch and he said
that the father was very upset about the news

152
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,166
while the mother was quite the opposite.

153
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,438
l'm gonna fax this information to you

154
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:50,505
so you can present it to the attorney
for the county of Roanoke.

155
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:54,108
But l think we have
your baby-snatcher here. Mulder?

156
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,854
Yeah. What? Yes.

157
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:59,254
l suggest that you proceed very carefully.

158
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:02,658
This could be very emotional
for everybody concerned.

159
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:04,820
All right, thank you.

160
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:33,791
- What are you doing?
- Sorry, l forgot my key.

161
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,383
Where've you been?

162
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:39,625
l told you l was gonna be on the road
until Tuesday... Poopydoo.

163
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:43,230
l was just so worried, Wayne.

164
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,395
We're getting so close now.

165
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:48,266
Honey...

166
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:51,400
l wouldn't let anything happen.

167
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:54,002
Not to our little bundle ofjoy.

168
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,184
l'll tell you who's taken hallucinogenics.

169
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:06,714
She didn't take any poison. My sister
never even heard of whatever the hell it is.

170
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,384
- Mandrake.
- Mandrake.

171
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,987
- Where would she get such a thing?
- All l took were herbal sleep aids.

172
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:16,728
- You don't need to say anything.
- Let your sister talk. lt might clear things up.

173
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:19,168
- Not without a lawyer.
- She's not under arrest.

174
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:24,369
You're damn right she's not. l didn't call you
here to tell me rumors l've already heard.

175
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:27,241
My sister's no baby killer!

176
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:31,673
What's going on?

177
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:34,651
They're accusing me
of taking the life of our baby.

178
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,812
- Who's accusing you?
- Who do you think?

179
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:41,292
l don't know where you've been, but l'm
the only one keeping the dogs from the door.

180
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,657
A man's gotta make a living.

181
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:47,994
Mr Weinsider, l don't want to arrest Laura.

182
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:52,561
l'm sure you'd hate like the devil
for that to happen as well.

183
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:55,399
l should say so.

184
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:58,568
Why not tell Deputy Stevens
it's OK to search the premises

185
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:03,240
so we can clear up any misunderstanding
about who's responsible for what happened?

186
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,407
Of course.

187
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:16,423
Laura? Could you come here?

188
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:25,565
Whatever else we find, l know
everybody in this house is regular.

189
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:39,342
l know there's nothing they're going to find,
but why do l feel guilty anyway?

190
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:43,354
Laura, there's something
l need to tell you about that.

191
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:47,688
Something l've kept secret for reasons
that l think will explain for themselves.

192
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,284
What are you talking about?

193
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:53,587
l don't exactly know how to say this,

194
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:56,964
but l'm sure that you might
find it painful, as l do.

195
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:58,832
Wayne, what?

196
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:02,763
On the night...

197
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:08,609
the night that you lost the baby,

198
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:12,150
l had gotten up because l couldn't sleep.

199
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:15,152
And when l came back to bed, you were...

200
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,853
you had...

201
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,723
our little baby in your hands.

202
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:26,899
You were in some kind of trance.
l couldn't get you to wake up.

203
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:27,331
You were in some kind of trance.
l couldn't get you to wake up.

204
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:34,168
You kept chanting over and over
''Zazas, zazas, nastanada, zazas...''

205
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:35,433
Wayne...

206
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:40,569
All l could do was take
our little boy, our little baby,

207
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:44,275
and wrap him up so l could make sure
no one could ever learn the truth.

208
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:45,975
Oh, my God.

209
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:47,985
And the other night...

210
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:54,626
when you saw me outside...
and l was burning the leaves...

211
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,890
No! No!

212
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:00,157
l was just doing it to protect you.

213
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:04,066
l knew that l could never
bring back our little boy,

214
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,865
our precious little Wayne Junior.

215
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:09,668
But l couldn't bear losing you.

216
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:17,711
Hey! Take a look at this!

217
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:34,198
l don't know what to tell you.

218
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:41,204
All l could think, when they told me
that something was wrong,

219
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:44,640
that there was a problem,

220
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:49,147
was that this thing that was
growing inside me was evil.

221
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:57,216
l kept thinking that maybe it was something
l did wrong and that this was my punishment.

222
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,692
l told Wayne that
everything was gonna be OK.

223
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:08,624
But l lied.

224
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:12,703
But you have to believe me, Arky.
l didn't mean to kill him.

225
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:18,308
l didn't know what l was doing.

226
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,702
lt was the herbal medication.

227
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:25,374
- That's all l can think...
- Laura, Laura.

228
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:28,983
l don't think you should say anymore.

229
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,486
l'm gonna have to read you your rights.

230
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:41,058
We're gonna have to go down
to the station and do all that.

231
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,658
l'm sorry.

232
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:03,681
You're gonna be OK.
l'm gonna get the best attorney.

233
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:13,421
l know what you are.

234
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:26,876
l'm only happy when it rains

235
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:30,847
l'm only happy when it's complicated

236
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:34,716
And though l know you can't appreciate it

237
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:35,980
l'm only happy...

238
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:38,181
- Hello?
- Hi, Betsy, it's me.

239
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:41,419
- Wayne, where are you?
- l'm on my way.

240
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:44,689
- You're late. l'm going without you.
- l wanna be there, honey.

241
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:48,391
l don't want to be a husband
who isn't there every step of the way.

242
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:52,233
You've already missed a lot of
steps already. lt's just a sonogram.

243
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:56,797
lt's notjust a sonogram. lt's a picture
of the expression of our beautiful love.

244
00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:00,038
- What have you been smoking?
- l'm three blocks away.

245
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:03,478
l'm gonna pull up in front of the house
in less than five minutes.

246
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:06,745
- OK, l'll wait for you.
- OK, five minutes.

247
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:09,582
- Hey, Wayne. Where are you going?
- What?

248
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:12,555
- Who you talking to?
- Who are you talking to?

249
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:15,388
- You seem like you're in an awful big hurry.
- Wayne?

250
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,293
- l'm late for an appointment.
- Appointment with who?

251
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:21,560
- A business client.
- Wayne, l'm hanging up now.

252
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:25,501
You're in insurance.
That must take you out on the road a lot.

253
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:28,801
l'm an insurance medical technician.

254
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:30,709
So where is our appointment?
How far do we have to go?

255
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,438
So where is our appointment?
How far do we have to go?

256
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:34,843
- What?
- Come on, l'll race ya.

257
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:46,819
l only smile in the dark...

258
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:53,994
Hi, Mrs Britton.
Wayne Weinsider. Remember me?

259
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:57,330
Harmony Mutual lnsurance? You had
an appointment to have blood taken.

260
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,802
lt's for next Tuesday.

261
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:02,362
l know that, Kim. Can l call you Kim?

262
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,602
l was in the neighborhood and...

263
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:08,806
insurance isn't something you wanna
be without, even forjust a week.

264
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,387
What do you do with that?

265
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:29,161
They check it, make sure
you're not a policy risk.

266
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,770
Slow down, monsters.

267
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:39,041
- Those your kids?
- Why, yes.

268
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:42,705
l love kids. Got a baby on the way myself.

269
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:46,173
Seems like l've been trying forever.

270
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:49,119
Hold that up.

271
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:56,317
Those are fine-looking boys.

272
00:24:56,862 --> 00:25:00,195
You don't know how lucky you are.

273
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:05,167
Two cells, with all that can go wrong,
and there they are. Perfect.

274
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:25,253
- You OK? You're not feeling faint, are you?
- No, l'm OK.

275
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:35,689
Can l use your phone?

276
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:42,970
l want those kids out of my car!

277
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:47,603
OK, Speed Racers! That's enough
driver's education for today.

278
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:51,315
Having your fun?

279
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:52,383
Yeah.

280
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,247
- You're busted.
- What?

281
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:57,083
l just got an earful from
Assistant Director Kersh.

282
00:25:57,188 --> 00:26:02,353
He got a call from Mr Weinsider,
who says that you're harassing him.

283
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:04,156
Leave me alone.

284
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:11,327
Mulder, l have to tell him something.
What do you want me to say?

285
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:15,134
Tell him l'm down here doing
a background check on somebody.

286
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:43,291
l got a message you needed to see me,
Laura. What is it?

287
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:45,869
l'm afraid.

288
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:52,438
l've been meeting with attorneys and, given
the circumstances and your emotional state,

289
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:56,274
they feel confident of an acquittal,
if that's what you're worried about.

290
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:59,680
No, Wayne. l've been thinking.

291
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:03,316
Thinking? About what?

292
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,219
About your story.

293
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:09,958
About how it doesn't make sense.

294
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:13,588
You said you wrapped
the baby up to hide it,

295
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:15,758
but what they found in the fire

296
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:20,601
was wrapped in the nightgown l had on
when l woke up from my nightmare.

297
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:25,232
But that's not possible, Laura.
You must be mistaken.

298
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:29,478
And l keep thinking about

299
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:35,178
the face of that terrible creature
at the end of the bed,

300
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:40,247
and l remember something
that l didn't tell anybody.

301
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,426
Not even you.

302
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,862
Laura, you're scaring me.

303
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:50,867
No matter what you believe,
l only have one desire: to protect you,

304
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:53,699
to put this all behind us.

305
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:07,107
Why'd you go and do that, Laura?

306
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:11,415
You've got to know that l love you.

307
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:17,527
And l just wish... you could've been the one.

308
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:21,064
Let me go, Wayne.

309
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:44,281
- What's her rhythm?
- Still in V-fib. Charge the paddles to 200.

310
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:48,025
- What happened?
- She just collapsed.

311
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,487
Clear!

312
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,959
Paddles are charged. Stand by.

313
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:56,262
lt was like...

314
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:59,302
lt was like she died right in my arms.

315
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,438
Going again. Clear.

316
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:01,632
Going again. Clear.

317
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:09,135
- We got a heartbeat.
- What?

318
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:13,848
Laura, can you hear me?
Laura, can you hear me?

319
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:21,190
l need to get her to the hospital right away.
l need a neurologist consult down at the ER.

320
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:24,592
Hang an lV of lidocaine
and let's get her out of here.

321
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,426
- That was a long five minutes.
- l can explain.

322
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:09,030
Please, Wayne. l've heard all your excuses.

323
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:12,076
Everything went fine without you.
lt always does.

324
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:14,441
- Did you get the sonogram?
- Yes.

325
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:16,605
Bring it back home?

326
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:25,016
- ls there a problem?
- The doctor found something.

327
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:30,494
She doesn't know yet, but there's some kind
of bony growth on the baby's spine and skull.

328
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:35,430
lt may just be a stage of development.
She really just wants to wait and see.

329
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:53,876
OK. Sure.

330
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:05,629
Whatever happens, you know
l love you. No matter what.

331
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:10,668
Do you, Wayne? Cos sometimes
l wonder what goes on inside your head.

332
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:14,231
Nothing but good thoughts.

333
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,708
You and this baby are my hopes and dreams.

334
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:17,231
You and this baby are my hopes and dreams.

335
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:20,902
Mine too.

336
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:26,681
Why don't l get you a warm glass of milk
and we'll go to bed?

337
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:28,081
OK.

338
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:43,232
You asked me to come here,
then you're nowhere to be found.

339
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:46,395
l was at County Records,
doing a background check.

340
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:52,034
Mulder... it's me.
That's your cover story, remember?

341
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:55,477
l was piecing together the history
of the man who did this to her.

342
00:31:55,546 --> 00:32:00,006
That's why l was looking for you,
because in fact nobody did anything to her.

343
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:03,850
There's absolutely no evidence of
bodily injury, overdose, suffocation,

344
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:07,186
of anything that would explain
why she was in a coma.

345
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:10,785
- Perfect.
- l don't think you heard what l said.

346
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:13,797
l did a complete medical review,
just as you asked.

347
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:18,562
What l'm saying is there is not a shred of
evidence to implicate the husband or anyone.

348
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:24,165
Not a shred of evidence is exactly the
evidence l hoped you'd find. Check this out.

349
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:31,978
''lvan Veles, born Czechoslovakia, 1956.''

350
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:36,646
''Married twice, widowed twice, no children.
Prosecuted twice for murder of wives.''

351
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:39,690
''Acquitted twice on lack of evidence.''
Who is lvan Veles?

352
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:44,660
Wayne Weinsider.
Czech national, emigrated 1994.

353
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:48,859
He's also known as Bud Hasselhoff.
Also known as Gordy Boytano.

354
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:51,800
- Gordy Boytano?
- There's more. Read on.

355
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:56,797
''ln Slavic societies, the name Veles
was synonymous with...

356
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:59,206
the devil.''

357
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:04,840
''From the Lithuanian root ''vele,'' a horned
demon who sucks the souls of the innocent.''

358
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:10,545
Mulder, you're not suggesting
that he is himself a devil, are you?

359
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:14,216
l'm not suggesting anything.
l think the facts speak for themselves.

360
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:19,161
l will accept that a man can be demonic,
that he may have demon-like attributes.

361
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:22,256
But why would a demon,
if there were such a thing,

362
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:26,861
bother with a Make-Room-For-Daddy routine
just so he can off his wife and unborn child?

363
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:29,371
l don't know why. l'm not a psychologist,

364
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,399
but this is the best explanation
for ''how'' that l've heard.

365
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:13,583
This'll put you to sleep on a cloud...

366
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:17,346
where troubles melt away.

367
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:21,418
Sometimes l remember
why l married you.

368
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:47,844
lt's pretty hard.

369
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,012
Get me the pick.

370
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:56,692
We've got technology out here.

371
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:57,728
Subterranean mapping equipment from
Richmond PD. Still can't find a damn thing.

372
00:34:57,728 --> 00:35:00,993
Subterranean mapping equipment from
Richmond PD. Still can't find a damn thing.

373
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:03,056
Over here!

374
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,964
Daniel, bring that light over here.

375
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:17,344
You'll find discrete osteopathic
deformities to the upper vertebrae.

376
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:22,944
Two bony protrusions between
the parietal and occipital lobes of the skull.

377
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:33,397
- Good Lord.
- Put out an APB for your brother-in-law.

378
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,591
- What are you talking...
- Just find him.

379
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:37,361
What are you talking about?

380
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:40,802
He's done this to other women here,
just like in Czechoslovakia.

381
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:44,865
My guess is that baby we dug up
belonged to one of Wayne's other wives.

382
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,604
You're saying
he's trying to profligate, to breed?

383
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:52,809
He's exercising his biological imperative.
He'll do or say anything he has to to succeed.

384
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:55,011
lt makes no sense. lf he wants to breed,

385
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:58,647
why would he snatch his own babies
and bury them in his back yard?

386
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:02,625
Because they're demons,
and he wants a normal child.

387
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,279
No! No!

388
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:25,042
Wayne! Wayne!

389
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,947
What are you doing?

390
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:34,351
Maybe you didn't hear me.
l said, what are you doing, Wayne?

391
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:46,561
1-5-5-2-7 Leahy.

392
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:52,405
That's in Cave Spring.
That's West Roanoke. Cave Spring.

393
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:55,377
Thank you. Thank you
very much for your help.

394
00:36:57,582 --> 00:36:58,981
Scully, hold on.

395
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:08,753
Where are we going?

396
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:12,818
Harmony Mutual lnsurance has
a second address for Wayne Weinsider,

397
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,956
all the way across the other side
of Roanoke County.

398
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:18,797
- You think he's got a second wife?
- Think about it.

399
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:21,633
He meets or screens
prospective women through work.

400
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:25,835
That's probably why he came to this country:
bigger gene pool, more women.

401
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:28,537
And he plants as many seeds as he can.

402
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:34,016
Let's just hope he hasn't been
able to harvest many more of them.

403
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:39,886
Mulder...

404
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,860
Please.

405
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,797
Please.

406
00:37:57,708 --> 00:37:59,903
Please.

407
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:03,412
He took my baby! He took my baby!

408
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:08,147
- lt's OK.
- Wayne. Wayne!

409
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:11,154
Wayne. He took my baby.

410
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:41,176
Mom?

411
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:44,688
Come on, don't make it any worse than it is.

412
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:50,691
- l'm sure you didn't mean to.
- Honest l didn't, Daddy.

413
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:54,287
- lf you say you didn't.
- Thank you, Daddy.

414
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:57,299
- How are you?
- ls he going to die?

415
00:38:57,401 --> 00:39:00,268
Of course not.
People don't die from chickenpox.

416
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:03,397
- Have you had chickenpox?
- Yes. How about you?

417
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:06,943
- l've been trying to remember.
- You'll know in a day or two.

418
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:11,037
That's what's worrying me.
l'll be down in a minute.

419
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:14,174
- l think she's going to die.
- Don't talk like that.

420
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:25,453
Wayne.

421
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:29,157
lt's over.

422
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:34,961
A normal life, a family.
That's all l ever wanted.

423
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,564
Where's the baby, Wayne?

424
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:42,612
How could she do this to them?

425
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,411
Put the shovel down.
Your lies won't work anymore.

426
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:49,681
My lies? What about her lies?

427
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:53,985
Whatever the truth, Mr Weinsider,
you can't hope to bury it now.

428
00:39:55,893 --> 00:40:00,421
l'm not burying anything. l'm digging it up.

429
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,090
Where's the baby?

430
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:08,165
Don't you understand?
She took it. Betsy took it!

431
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,970
You can't blame anyone else,
like you did with Laura.

432
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:16,106
Don't you see?

433
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:18,443
Betsy isn't like Laura.

434
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,645
Betsy is...

435
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:31,386
Get the paramedics.

436
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:41,230
l just wanted what everyone wants.

437
00:40:56,654 --> 00:41:01,614
Don't even think about it. Put him someplace
else. l don't want him in sight of my sister.

438
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:04,024
- He just got out of surgery.
- Give me this.

439
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:06,824
Cut it out. You're in enough trouble as it is.

440
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:11,596
You don't wanna complicate your situation
by endangering his life again, do you?

441
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:15,298
That son of a bitch better live,
so l can beat the truth out of him.

442
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:18,637
Find out why he did it
and how the hell he did it.

443
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:22,304
l think the ''why''
is directly related to the ''how.''

444
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:25,439
What do you mean?
What do you mean by that?

445
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:29,679
We should go talk to his other wife, Betsy.

446
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:31,846
l don't know.

447
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,408
He's flatlined.

448
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:33,882
Page Dr Nyland up here!

449
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:38,648
Just breathe deep, Mrs Weinsider.
Can you breathe for me?

450
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,300
How many?

451
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:04,073
Four, total. All here for some time.

452
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:08,878
Maybe years. All normal, though, Mulder.

453
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:12,046
No osteological deformities.

454
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:17,287
And Betsy's baby isn't here.
There are no fresh graves.

455
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:18,827
l know.

456
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:23,563
- What did he do with it?
- l don't think he did anything with it.

457
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:28,435
But she was recently pregnant. l saw
her records, her sonograms, in the house.

458
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:32,441
Showing the same defects.
These weren't Wayne's babies, Scully.

459
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:35,441
Whose babies were they?

460
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:38,845
l think Wayne realized something last night.

461
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:43,080
He realized that he'd met someone
even more evil than he was,

462
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:47,487
who would sacrifice what
he desperately wanted for himself.

463
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:48,523
Betsy?

464
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:53,689
lt was no coincidence that she ran into us.
We were taken in by herjust like Wayne was.

465
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,493
She would say or do anything
to get what she wanted,

466
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,694
and was even more driven than he was.

467
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:03,136
- Driven to what?
- To have what only Wayne could give her.

468
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:10,377
l'm only happy when it rains

469
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:14,315
You know l love it when the news is bad

470
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:18,253
And why it feels so good to feel so sad

471
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:22,520
l'm only happy when it rains

472
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:28,363
Pour your misery down

473
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:32,334
Pour your misery down on me

474
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:36,237
Pour your misery down

475
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:40,743
Pour your misery down on me

476
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:01,794
