1
00:00:12,195 --> 00:00:14,220
- Dr Cabrera!
- Where is he?

2
00:00:14,297 --> 00:00:17,095
- Trauma.
- Who transferred him from lCU?

3
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,967
l did. During prep for therapeutic
plasmapheresis he went into shock.

4
00:00:22,038 --> 00:00:23,505
- Vitals?
- Not good.

5
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:26,837
Pulse is 40, blood pressure 80 over 50.
His GCS is six.

6
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,244
Get on the phone to the FBl. There's
an Agent Scully that should be notified.

7
00:00:31,314 --> 00:00:33,373
- The FBl?
- This man is an FBl agent.

8
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,045
- What's wrong with him?
- What's wrong is he's going to die.

9
00:00:58,675 --> 00:01:01,007
Can you hear me?

10
00:01:01,077 --> 00:01:02,874
Mr Skinner?

11
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:10,885
l'm not understanding. Can you speak up?

12
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:18,219
- What did he say?
- A name.

13
00:01:21,264 --> 00:01:23,357
He's coding on us.

14
00:01:28,471 --> 00:01:30,098
Clear.

15
00:01:30,206 --> 00:01:32,504
Dr Cabrera, clear!

16
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:34,406
Dr Cabrera?

17
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:40,313
Let him go.

18
00:02:22,158 --> 00:02:24,991
Every minute of every day, we choose:

19
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:28,087
who we are, who we forgive,

20
00:02:28,198 --> 00:02:30,689
who we defend and protect.

21
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,292
To choose a side or to walk the line.

22
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,269
To play the middle.

23
00:02:36,372 --> 00:02:40,832
To straddle the fence between
what is and what should be.

24
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,276
This was the course l chose.

25
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:47,315
Trying to find the delicate balance
of interests that can never exist,

26
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:52,411
choosing by not choosing,
defending a center which cannot hold.

27
00:02:54,123 --> 00:02:56,216
So death chose for me.

28
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:11,173
Go easy on him, Slugger.
l need him to lock up for me tonight, OK?

29
00:03:30,193 --> 00:03:35,392
Don't telegraph that left, Dre.
Stevie Wonder would see that one comin'!

30
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,992
You're fightin' the FBl now, Dre. Fight smart.

31
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:44,263
Go!

32
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,772
Hey, Slugger?

33
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,839
You OK?

34
00:04:27,951 --> 00:04:30,818
Slugger, can you hear me?

35
00:04:30,887 --> 00:04:33,947
Talk to me. You all right?

36
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,386
Mr Skinner?

37
00:04:39,796 --> 00:04:42,390
Mr Skinner? Hi.

38
00:04:43,433 --> 00:04:45,492
You gonna stick with us now?

39
00:04:47,503 --> 00:04:52,907
- Do you remember what happened?
- l was boxing. l must've gotten tagged.

40
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:58,174
Yes, you did. At least you didn't get
your ear bit off. That's something, right?

41
00:04:58,247 --> 00:05:00,977
Doctor Plant'll be with you in a minute.

42
00:05:23,272 --> 00:05:25,365
Yeah, Skinner.

43
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:27,608
Hello?

44
00:05:27,677 --> 00:05:30,544
Walter Skinner.

45
00:05:30,613 --> 00:05:31,739
Who is this?

46
00:05:31,814 --> 00:05:35,614
Have you heard the news?

47
00:05:35,685 --> 00:05:39,018
lt's... in... you.

48
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,214
What is this?

49
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:46,353
You... have 24 hours... to go.

50
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,659
What is this? What do you want?

51
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,757
You are...

52
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:53,893
already dead.

53
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:05,440
Mr Skinner. l didn't expect to see you
up and around. You must be feeling better.

54
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,844
Can you take a seat
on the table for me, please?

55
00:06:16,592 --> 00:06:20,551
l'm Dr Plant. l was here with you before.

56
00:06:21,431 --> 00:06:23,592
- You probably don't remember.
- No.

57
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:27,396
The good news
is your dilation's back to normal.

58
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,871
Plus, you still have both your ears.

59
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,134
l heard that one.

60
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:37,578
l'm gonna release you.
But l suggest that you rethink the boxing.

61
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,548
You're not 20 anymore.

62
00:06:40,616 --> 00:06:42,777
There's nothing wrong with me?

63
00:06:42,852 --> 00:06:44,979
You got your bell rung.

64
00:06:45,054 --> 00:06:47,818
Other than that, l think you're fine.

65
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,188
You might want to ice that bruise.

66
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:51,624
What bruise?

67
00:06:56,065 --> 00:06:57,760
Right here.

68
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:01,964
- How the hell did l get that?
- Must've taken a hard one to the ribs.

69
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:07,840
But there's nothing broken.
No internal bleeding. Like l said, you'll live.

70
00:07:09,812 --> 00:07:11,143
Thanks.

71
00:07:40,676 --> 00:07:43,042
What is it, Agent Mulder?

72
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:48,381
l just thought
l'd poke my head in and say ''hey.''

73
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,814
Hey.

74
00:07:56,025 --> 00:07:59,586
- Are you sleepin' one off?
- No, l was just havin' trouble seeing.

75
00:07:59,662 --> 00:08:04,929
- lt's nothing. l just didn't think l should drive.
- You gonna be all right, sir?

76
00:08:21,384 --> 00:08:23,909
He's gonna tell you he's all right.

77
00:08:23,986 --> 00:08:27,649
- There's nothing wrong with me.
- Not that l could tell if there was.

78
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:31,351
- Why are the lights out?
- He's havin' trouble with his eyes.

79
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:34,362
He's also got a nasty bruise on his ribcage.

80
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:38,656
- What'd you do?
- lt's nothing.

81
00:08:43,072 --> 00:08:44,130
Says who?

82
00:08:44,207 --> 00:08:48,200
Says the doctor who
released me from the hospital.

83
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,272
That was the second opinion.
The first was unsolicited.

84
00:08:54,383 --> 00:08:59,411
A phone call at the hospital. A scrambled
voice telling him he had 24 hours to live.

85
00:08:59,488 --> 00:09:04,016
That was somebody yanking my chain.
l got a clean bill of health.

86
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:11,528
ln the last 48 hours, did you eat or drink
anything that tasted metallic or odd?

87
00:09:11,601 --> 00:09:13,762
You think that l'm poisoned?

88
00:09:15,204 --> 00:09:19,334
- Did the doctor take your blood?
- Yes, and it checked out.

89
00:09:19,408 --> 00:09:24,107
- Poisoning could've been overlooked.
- lf so, why call and tell me at the hospital?

90
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,411
To scare you. See what you'd do,
who you'd turn to.

91
00:09:29,785 --> 00:09:32,913
- This is about you.
- Or about the X-Files.

92
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:38,253
You are so paranoid, Mulder.
You're not even on the X-Files anymore.

93
00:09:38,361 --> 00:09:41,125
No, but you are. You still supervise them.

94
00:09:42,732 --> 00:09:45,394
What happened today?
Anything out of the ordinary?

95
00:09:45,468 --> 00:09:47,231
l'm not gonna play this game.

96
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:52,069
lt could've been anything. lt could've been
the slightest touch or a handshake.

97
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:55,234
- This morning, you woke up...
- l woke up.

98
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:58,745
- Alone?
- Yes. Alone.

99
00:09:58,814 --> 00:10:03,012
- How'd you get to the office?
- The same way that l always do. l drove.

100
00:10:03,085 --> 00:10:06,145
- Then what?
- Nothing. l had meetings, l went to the gym,

101
00:10:06,222 --> 00:10:09,020
- to the hospital and now l'm here.
- Just slow down.

102
00:10:09,091 --> 00:10:13,551
One step at a time. How'd you get
from the parking garage to your office?

103
00:10:13,629 --> 00:10:16,063
- The elevator.
- And then what?

104
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:23,898
l walked up the hallway. l passed the same
dozen people that l pass every morning.

105
00:10:25,908 --> 00:10:28,468
l went to my office.

106
00:10:28,577 --> 00:10:31,273
l said good morning to my secretary.

107
00:10:32,248 --> 00:10:34,716
And she said good morning to me.

108
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,308
l made calls, l did paperwork,
then l was here for the rest of the day.

109
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:41,049
Think. There's gotta be something.

110
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,134
ln the hallway, there was a man.

111
00:10:54,203 --> 00:10:57,104
He stopped me. He wanted to know the time.

112
00:10:59,842 --> 00:11:01,935
Did he touch you?

113
00:11:06,549 --> 00:11:10,610
He grabbed me. On my right wrist.

114
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:17,284
lt wouldn't necessarily leave a mark.
Some poisons are absorbed through the skin.

115
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,051
What time was it?

116
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,424
There you are.

117
00:11:25,234 --> 00:11:28,101
That's him. Right there.

118
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:33,039
Wait a second, back up.

119
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,179
lt can't be.

120
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:44,685
That's Kenneth Orgel. Advisor to a Senate
subcommittee on Ethics in New Technology.

121
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,221
- He's a scientist?
- A physicist.

122
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:50,850
Very well-known, as far as physicists go.

123
00:11:50,926 --> 00:11:55,295
He signed in here as a visitor to the office
of Assistant Director Walter Skinner.

124
00:11:55,398 --> 00:11:59,596
- Why would he be coming to see you?
- l'd like to ask him that myself.

125
00:11:59,668 --> 00:12:03,570
lf he poisoned you, you should be
off your feet and under a doctor's care.

126
00:12:03,672 --> 00:12:08,939
l'm gonna put a gun to his head, find out why
and ask him how he's gonna make me well.

127
00:12:09,578 --> 00:12:12,775
- What hospital was he in?
- St Katherine's.

128
00:12:34,236 --> 00:12:36,830
- Yes?
- Dr Orgel?

129
00:12:36,972 --> 00:12:38,564
- Kenneth Orgel?
- Yes.

130
00:12:39,475 --> 00:12:41,602
Do you know who l am?

131
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,304
No.

132
00:12:43,412 --> 00:12:47,280
My name's Walter Skinner.
l'm an assistant director at the FBl.

133
00:12:47,383 --> 00:12:51,319
Dr Orgel, you visited the FBl this morning.
You came to see Mr Skinner.

134
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,321
No. You must be mistaken.

135
00:12:55,324 --> 00:12:58,487
Sorry. You'll have to come back another time.

136
00:13:02,598 --> 00:13:05,066
- Go around back.
- What?

137
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,477
Please, you're bothering me.

138
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,752
Federal Agent!

139
00:13:40,302 --> 00:13:41,667
Go!

140
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,333
Drop the gun.

141
00:14:12,401 --> 00:14:14,528
Drop it!

142
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,372
So's your mom.

143
00:15:00,215 --> 00:15:02,012
Give it a rest!

144
00:15:13,362 --> 00:15:15,330
- Let him go, Agent Mulder.
- What?

145
00:15:15,397 --> 00:15:19,527
He's got diplomatic papers.
lt's our mistake. You can go.

146
00:15:19,602 --> 00:15:21,661
Just let him go.

147
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:31,574
Get inside. The police'll be here any moment
and l don't have time to answer questions.

148
00:15:31,647 --> 00:15:32,978
He's Alexander Lazreg.

149
00:15:33,048 --> 00:15:37,280
L-a-z-r-e-g. He's a cultural attaché
with the Tunisian Mission here in DC.

150
00:15:37,386 --> 00:15:41,584
- See what else you can find out.
- You need to get to the hospital.

151
00:15:41,657 --> 00:15:44,148
No, l'm tryin' to stay out of one.

152
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,661
- The boxer. FBl.
- You released him earlier this evening.

153
00:15:55,771 --> 00:15:58,706
- ls he not all right?
- That's why l'm here.

154
00:15:58,807 --> 00:16:03,506
- He may have been poisoned.
- You're kidding. By whom?

155
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:07,538
l don't know. ln fact,
l'm not even sure what l'm looking for.

156
00:16:07,616 --> 00:16:11,143
You're lucky. He's on a government HMO.

157
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,520
- No one's even handled his samples yet.
- ls this them in here?

158
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:21,822
l'm not supposed to let you have those.
Not without a written release from the patient.

159
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:24,558
We may not have time.

160
00:16:24,633 --> 00:16:27,193
He may not have time either.

161
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:32,935
- He had no symptoms of poisoning.
- Are you sure these haven't been processed?

162
00:16:33,008 --> 00:16:36,671
l'm not sure, but l doubt
they've even been touched.

163
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,928
- l'm not so sure you should be doin' that.
- This a crime scene. What should l do?

164
00:17:03,005 --> 00:17:07,965
l'm just concerned for Dr Orgel's personal
property. And preservation of evidence.

165
00:17:08,043 --> 00:17:11,945
l'd be a lot more concerned for
the preservation of Dr Orgel.

166
00:17:24,593 --> 00:17:26,652
Hello, Senator.

167
00:17:37,573 --> 00:17:39,837
lt's carbon.

168
00:17:41,443 --> 00:17:47,211
Pure carbon. How in the world
would that get into his bloodstream?

169
00:17:47,282 --> 00:17:51,651
- And how is it working as a poison?
- By all rights, it shouldn't be.

170
00:18:01,563 --> 00:18:04,623
Look at them, just rattling around in solution.

171
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:06,792
lt's just bizarre.

172
00:18:08,437 --> 00:18:10,962
- Did you see that?
- Did you just touch something?

173
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,132
No, l didn't.

174
00:18:14,042 --> 00:18:16,408
They just multiplied. Look!

175
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,644
They just did it again!

176
00:18:20,749 --> 00:18:22,717
Zooming in.

177
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,551
What the hell are they?

178
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,266
Wait here, please.

179
00:19:06,328 --> 00:19:09,991
l don't have to tell you how late it is,
do l, Agent Mulder?

180
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,367
But l suspect that wasn't
a consideration of yours.

181
00:19:14,436 --> 00:19:18,634
Actually, time is
my only consideration, Senator.

182
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,799
This was taken only three days ago.

183
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:24,310
lt's of you and Dr Kenneth Orgel
holding a Senate resolution.

184
00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:27,212
SR819, l think it's called. What is that?

185
00:19:27,316 --> 00:19:30,251
A funding bill. What is this all about?

186
00:19:30,352 --> 00:19:33,788
A friend of mine is going to die
because of SR819.

187
00:19:33,856 --> 00:19:37,314
l don't know how, l don't even know why.

188
00:19:37,392 --> 00:19:40,020
- But l bet you do.
- What are you talking about?

189
00:19:40,128 --> 00:19:43,620
l don't even really know yet.
All l have is a Tunisian diplomat,

190
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:47,428
this Dr Kenneth Orgel,
this health bill, SR819,

191
00:19:47,536 --> 00:19:51,836
all leading to a plot to kill an assistant
director of the FBl. Does that make sense?

192
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:57,845
The bill you refer to will provide money and
supplies to the World Health Organization,

193
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:01,006
medical technology to Third World countries.

194
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:06,277
l have aided you in the past
with information, Fox, and advice,

195
00:20:06,388 --> 00:20:09,152
which right now is to leave here at once,

196
00:20:09,224 --> 00:20:15,356
and never again suggest to anyone
my involvement in any such dark intrigue.

197
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,421
- Am l understood?
- This man may die.

198
00:20:17,499 --> 00:20:23,301
- He may only have a few hours to live.
- My intention is to save lives, Fox.

199
00:20:24,373 --> 00:20:27,035
But l can't save his.

200
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,870
Good night, Fox. Drive safely.

201
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,851
Dr Plant?

202
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:33,154
- What? What is it?
- l think l found it.

203
00:23:33,261 --> 00:23:36,890
l think l found what the carbon's doing.

204
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:41,162
lt's notjust reproducing itself.
lt has behavior.

205
00:23:41,236 --> 00:23:46,572
lt's creating something. A matrix, stimulated
by blood flow in response to movement.

206
00:23:46,641 --> 00:23:51,203
lt's multiplying, then solidifying
in an orderly fashion.

207
00:23:52,447 --> 00:23:55,780
lt's building valves or dams
in the vascular system.

208
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,979
lt's building a heart attack.

209
00:23:59,054 --> 00:24:02,615
Dr Plant? You're doing blood work
on a Walter Skinner?

210
00:24:02,724 --> 00:24:04,021
Yes.

211
00:24:04,126 --> 00:24:07,926
A Walter Skinner has been picked up
by paramedics at a parking garage.

212
00:24:07,996 --> 00:24:10,658
- Where are they taking him?
- DC General.

213
00:24:16,404 --> 00:24:21,967
Did you see this? We've got
some sort of extreme vascular event here.

214
00:24:25,147 --> 00:24:29,777
- How is he even still alive?
- We'll take the left arm first.

215
00:24:32,954 --> 00:24:35,218
Mark itjust above the bicep.

216
00:24:37,826 --> 00:24:41,091
- Let's get to it.
- l'll get this side.

217
00:24:42,197 --> 00:24:44,995
- Hey, you! Out!
- l know this man.

218
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:48,558
- l don't care. This is a sterile operating room.
- Get them out.

219
00:24:48,637 --> 00:24:53,097
l'm sorry. We've been investigating
his illness. What are you doing?

220
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:57,406
- lf he's gonna live, he has to lose his arms.
- That won't save him. lt's his blood.

221
00:24:57,479 --> 00:25:00,039
- Who the hell is this woman?
- She's a doctor.

222
00:25:00,115 --> 00:25:05,951
You're not gonna solve anything until you get
a scope into him. Nothing else is gonna work.

223
00:25:06,054 --> 00:25:10,013
lf you wanna save this man,
listen to what l'm saying.

224
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:24,395
lt's OK, sir.

225
00:25:24,472 --> 00:25:25,734
Lie back down.

226
00:25:28,677 --> 00:25:31,373
We're just moving you to another room.

227
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,539
Who did this to me?

228
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:37,608
That's what Mulder's trying
to figure out right now.

229
00:25:37,686 --> 00:25:41,486
But we're gonna take good care of you.
l promise.

230
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,854
We're gonna do everything we can.

231
00:25:54,236 --> 00:25:56,966
l don't know. l can't remember.

232
00:26:18,793 --> 00:26:21,921
Sir? ls that you?

233
00:26:24,933 --> 00:26:28,061
- Agent Mulder?
- Do you have the key to this drawer?

234
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,729
- What are you doing?
- Skinner's in the hospital.

235
00:26:30,805 --> 00:26:32,864
- Somebody poisoned him.
- Why?

236
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:36,171
- For doing his job.
- l don't understand.

237
00:26:36,244 --> 00:26:39,645
l'm looking for anything
that relates to Senate Resolution 819.

238
00:26:39,748 --> 00:26:42,239
lf you wanna save his life, open this drawer.

239
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:46,980
- l don't have the key.
- Do you have a letter opener? Something?

240
00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:52,752
ls he going to be all right?

241
00:27:17,252 --> 00:27:20,813
- What's his condition?
- He's stable, but it's not good.

242
00:27:20,922 --> 00:27:23,823
He's got extreme vascular trauma
and distention.

243
00:27:23,925 --> 00:27:27,520
His blood has become
a weapon against his body.

244
00:27:27,595 --> 00:27:30,155
- Can you fight it?
- We don't know what it is.

245
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:33,997
The best that we can do is
keep lasering his arteries open.

246
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:38,028
But it's only gonna be
a matter of time before we lose.

247
00:27:38,139 --> 00:27:44,135
lt's building walls in his vessels
faster than we can tear them down.

248
00:27:44,212 --> 00:27:46,772
We don't have the technology to combat it.

249
00:27:46,848 --> 00:27:49,544
- Maybe we do.
- What is this?

250
00:27:49,617 --> 00:27:55,453
l found this in Skinner's morning mail. He
was doing a security check on a Senate bill

251
00:27:55,557 --> 00:27:59,391
for violation of trade laws
involving sensitive technology.

252
00:27:59,461 --> 00:28:01,793
But this is just a routine procedure.

253
00:28:01,896 --> 00:28:05,354
- The FBl does dozens a year.
- This bill was going to vote in the Senate.

254
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:11,099
All it was waiting on was Skinner's review
and an analysis by Dr Kenneth Orgel.

255
00:28:11,172 --> 00:28:15,108
You're sayin' Dr Orgel poisoned Skinner
to cover up his analysis?

256
00:28:15,176 --> 00:28:19,579
Orgel didn't poison anybody. He came
to the FBl to tell Skinner what he knew -

257
00:28:19,647 --> 00:28:24,516
that there was a gross violation
of export laws involving new technology.

258
00:28:25,587 --> 00:28:28,988
- New technology?
- You know what that means?

259
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:33,418
l think l might.

260
00:28:35,397 --> 00:28:37,331
lt's not me.

261
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:40,425
You want to get this?
lt was in his pants pocket.

262
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:45,462
- Hello?
- Might as well give up.

263
00:28:45,573 --> 00:28:48,542
- Who is it?
- lt's a computer-synth voice.

264
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:52,671
You can't stop it.

265
00:28:52,781 --> 00:28:56,683
- Somebody that must know he's here.
- Walter Skinner.

266
00:28:56,785 --> 00:28:58,184
Your time...

267
00:29:18,206 --> 00:29:21,300
Federal Agent! Stop right there!

268
00:31:07,749 --> 00:31:11,048
- Yes.
- The bill is in danger, Senator.

269
00:31:11,152 --> 00:31:14,349
- A new threat has emerged.
- You shouldn't have called me.

270
00:31:14,422 --> 00:31:18,882
- Blood will be on your hands.
- l don't buy your hollow threats.

271
00:31:20,061 --> 00:31:22,757
But Dr Orgel does. You can ask him.

272
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:25,560
What have you done with him?

273
00:31:27,902 --> 00:31:30,427
l can tell you where to find him.

274
00:31:34,676 --> 00:31:39,113
The car's leased, part of a fleet service
that services the diplomatic counsel corps.

275
00:31:39,213 --> 00:31:42,649
- What forensic evidence did you lift?
- Not much on the outside.

276
00:31:42,717 --> 00:31:47,654
Not surprising, considering the condition of
the vehicle. lnside we found a couple of hairs.

277
00:31:47,722 --> 00:31:50,657
Human. From an expensive wig.

278
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:56,994
Don't hate me cos l'm beautiful. What else?

279
00:31:57,065 --> 00:32:01,126
We scraped the tire treads.
Found something odd.

280
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:05,603
lt's full of polychlorinated biphenyls.
PCBs. Over 500 parts per million.

281
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:10,474
That's the kind of levels they used to see
in the 1970s. Before the EPA got fangs.

282
00:32:10,578 --> 00:32:16,608
- From where?
- The PCBs are saturated evenly in the clay.

283
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:20,142
A demo site, maybe. Or an old power plant.

284
00:33:41,369 --> 00:33:43,428
Who's there?

285
00:33:45,573 --> 00:33:47,666
ls someone there?

286
00:33:51,412 --> 00:33:54,040
Senator, please let me go.

287
00:33:55,717 --> 00:33:58,515
l need... water.

288
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:03,989
- Who did this to you?
- Hurry. Please.

289
00:34:04,058 --> 00:34:06,253
lt's... killing me.

290
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,921
They believe you have exposed them
to the FBl. To Walter Skinner.

291
00:34:09,997 --> 00:34:13,228
l told the FBl nothing. l told them nothing.

292
00:34:13,334 --> 00:34:16,167
Please. l promise not to expose anyone.

293
00:35:00,381 --> 00:35:03,578
Sir, there's something l'd like to try.

294
00:35:03,651 --> 00:35:07,052
lt's a treatment called
therapeutic plasmapheresis.

295
00:35:07,155 --> 00:35:11,148
lt requires filtering
all of the blood in your body.

296
00:35:11,225 --> 00:35:16,663
lt's a radical procedure, and there is a danger
that your body might go into shock.

297
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,059
l'm in your hands.

298
00:35:25,072 --> 00:35:28,235
l think l owe you an apology, Scully.

299
00:35:31,179 --> 00:35:33,841
- You and Mulder.
- Sir?

300
00:35:35,183 --> 00:35:37,674
l've been lying here, thinking.

301
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:42,680
Your quest.

302
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:47,992
- lt should have been mine.
- What do you mean?

303
00:35:51,265 --> 00:35:54,063
lf l die now, l die in vain.

304
00:35:57,805 --> 00:36:00,899
l have nothing to show for myself.

305
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,578
My life.

306
00:36:04,645 --> 00:36:07,136
Sir, you know that's not true.

307
00:36:07,215 --> 00:36:09,342
lt is.

308
00:36:13,187 --> 00:36:15,747
l can see now that...

309
00:36:15,823 --> 00:36:18,348
l always played it safe.

310
00:36:19,327 --> 00:36:22,023
l wouldn't take sides.

311
00:36:23,197 --> 00:36:25,256
Wouldn't let you and Mulder...

312
00:36:27,001 --> 00:36:28,832
pull me in.

313
00:36:30,872 --> 00:36:34,808
You've been our ally
more times than l can say.

314
00:36:38,746 --> 00:36:41,840
Not the kind of ally that l could have been.

315
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:59,391
- l remember now.
- What?

316
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:09,234
- l can't see his face. He has a beard.
- Try.

317
00:37:13,114 --> 00:37:15,173
He was at the gym.

318
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,913
At the hospital.

319
00:37:23,591 --> 00:37:25,650
He killed that man.

320
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:31,931
He was at the FBl
when Orgel approached me.

321
00:37:33,034 --> 00:37:36,003
He was following you?

322
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:39,403
The tape. He's on the surveillance tape.

323
00:38:42,203 --> 00:38:45,434
You must be surprised to see me here.

324
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:57,879
- l'm sure l'm not the man you're looking for.
- Where is he? Where's Orgel?

325
00:38:57,985 --> 00:39:00,783
- Orgel is dead.
- l don't believe you.

326
00:39:00,855 --> 00:39:03,756
You lied to me this morning,
you're lying to me now.

327
00:39:03,824 --> 00:39:06,224
- Drop this, Fox.
- Where is Orgel?

328
00:39:06,327 --> 00:39:10,388
l need to know what he knows!
A friend of mine is dying!

329
00:39:10,498 --> 00:39:14,628
l tell you, they killed him.
What Orgel knows died with him.

330
00:39:14,735 --> 00:39:19,229
Then tell me what you know, Senator!
This is about SR819, isn't it?

331
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:24,642
- What the hell did they put in Skinner?
- l'm sure you already have some idea, Fox.

332
00:39:28,382 --> 00:39:31,249
lt's the same technology SR819 will export.

333
00:39:31,352 --> 00:39:35,220
Technology that the world believes
is purely theoretical.

334
00:39:36,824 --> 00:39:41,625
Nanotechnology.
Microscopic, atom-sized machines.

335
00:39:43,564 --> 00:39:47,056
- Machines can be stopped.
- Your friend is already dead.

336
00:39:47,168 --> 00:39:50,763
- l don't believe that.
- lf you pursue this, they will kill you.

337
00:39:50,838 --> 00:39:53,966
Not before l expose you and your role in this.

338
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:56,976
My role? l am a victim here.

339
00:39:57,044 --> 00:40:00,070
Don't you understand that?
l'm fighting for my life!

340
00:40:00,181 --> 00:40:03,241
- l will stop this!
- lt's too late, Fox!

341
00:40:04,418 --> 00:40:06,477
lt's too late!

342
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:23,060
He's coding on us.

343
00:40:25,072 --> 00:40:27,267
Clear!

344
00:40:27,374 --> 00:40:29,968
Dr Cabrera, clear!

345
00:40:30,044 --> 00:40:31,978
Dr Cabrera?

346
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,172
Let him go.

347
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,048
Call time of death... 9:33.

348
00:41:43,651 --> 00:41:48,054
l've spoken with your doctors
and your prognosis is excellent.

349
00:41:48,122 --> 00:41:51,091
Whatever you were infected with
appears to be dormant.

350
00:41:51,225 --> 00:41:55,025
And your recovery is being
hailed as a miracle.

351
00:41:55,129 --> 00:41:58,292
The man who poisoned you
was at the FBl that day.

352
00:41:58,399 --> 00:42:03,166
Scully was able to pull these
off the security videotapes.

353
00:42:03,237 --> 00:42:08,573
We're hoping it mightjog your memory.
Maybe you can identify this man.

354
00:42:10,411 --> 00:42:12,003
No, l'm sorry.

355
00:42:15,182 --> 00:42:20,449
SR819 was withdrawn by committee
late last night, without explanation.

356
00:42:22,056 --> 00:42:26,152
- Good. So this man failed, then.
- lf that was his true motive.

357
00:42:27,861 --> 00:42:31,160
lf he poisoned you to prevent you
from investigating SR819,

358
00:42:31,265 --> 00:42:33,961
why call you to tell you that?

359
00:42:34,868 --> 00:42:38,668
This man worked for the government
that was to receive this technology.

360
00:42:38,772 --> 00:42:41,206
He killed one of his own to save you.

361
00:42:44,011 --> 00:42:47,879
So you still think this was about you?
About the X-Files?

362
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:52,078
Yes. Yes, l do, and l have an idea
who may be behind all this,

363
00:42:52,186 --> 00:42:56,122
but l'd need your authority
to continue the investigation.

364
00:43:01,395 --> 00:43:06,992
l have neither the authority nor the will to
allow your continued inquiry into this matter.

365
00:43:08,636 --> 00:43:12,470
You'll perform your duties as directed
by AD Kersh and only AD Kersh.

366
00:43:12,573 --> 00:43:14,598
Sir?

367
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:18,372
This matter's closed, agents. Am l clear?

368
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:01,278
l've been expecting you to show up.

369
00:44:06,193 --> 00:44:09,185
You know l can push the button any time.

370
00:44:09,263 --> 00:44:12,562
What do you want from me?
What's this about, Krycek?

371
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,663
All in good time.

372
