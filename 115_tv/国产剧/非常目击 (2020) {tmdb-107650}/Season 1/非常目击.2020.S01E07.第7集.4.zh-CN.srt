4
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:53,440
Keep 'em closed.

5
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,370
They're closed. God,ray.

6
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:00,640
I hope this isn't the part where you hack
me into bits and bury me in the woods.

7
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:04,190
This is not the outfit I
want to be found dead in.

8
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:04,770
All right.

9
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,700
Why are we stopping?

10
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,920
'Cause we're here.

11
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,960
Okay,open 'em.

12
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,160
- This is it?
- This is it.

13
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,430
Your tent?

14
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,340
My tent.

15
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,580
Is this your property?

16
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,220
This is my property.

17
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,590
This is my lake.

18
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,180
This is my yard.

19
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,980
My house.

20
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,810
And my tent.

21
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,090
Oh,why can't we just go in the house?

22
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,730
I don't live in a house.

23
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,230
I live in a tent.

24
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,750
Come on.

25
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,260
marcel proust?

26
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,720
Marcel proust. Your tattoo.

27
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:59,180
Oh,right. Yeah.

28
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,580
I should have gotten sylvia plath.

29
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:12,590
I had a man-- an ugly
man-- tell me I wasn't ugly.

30
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:19,760
An ugly man...named floyd.

31
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,820
You're not ugly.

32
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:28,780
You're not real,are you?

33
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,650
I'm pierce.

34
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,040
This was it.

35
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,750
No more bullshit.

36
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,140
No randall.

37
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,440
No force-fed lines.

38
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,710
No flat tires by the side of the road.

39
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:11,350
It was just me and her making out in
my tent with the wind howling outside.

40
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,170
oh,fuck.

41
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,670
you're-- you're
unbelievable.

42
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,270
It felt different this time.

43
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,300
It felt real.

44
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:35,450
Which is why waking up next to that pile of
cold hard cash felt like such a kick in the gut.

45
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,040
Shit,jemma.

46
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:41,210
I thought we were past this.

47
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,590
oh my god.

48
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,980
Ray,what are you doing here?

49
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,430
Here.

50
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,670
Here's your cut.

51
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,860
She paid you directly again?

52
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,610
Unbelievable.

53
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,530
It just feels fantastic to
be undermined at every turn.

54
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,340
Is it all here?

55
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,100
You know what? Now's not
a good time for company.

56
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,890
Look,I'm sorry. I'm
sorry for last night.

57
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,530
I didn't even want this money.

58
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:15,540
I just... I don't think jemma
should be a client anymore.

59
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,420
You want to cut her off?

60
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,490
No,I don't want to  cut her off.

61
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,490
I just don't-- I don't
want her to be a client.

62
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,790
What are you sayin

63
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:27,160
I think...

64
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,660
- I want her to--
- to be a girlfriend or something?

65
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,410
Hey,babe,can I use this eggplant?

66
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,000
You-yeah.

67
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,250
What?

68
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:41,830
All I know is that there's
something going on between us.

69
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,260
Some...
thing that--

70
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,880
- babe,eggplant?
- It's fine. Just use it.

71
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,180
You want to explain something to me?

72
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:51,310
Just how do you see this
business venture of ours working?

73
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,290
Because I've been pouring my blood,sweat and
tears into this happiness consultant thing

74
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,180
and you seem determined
to undermine our success.

75
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:58,850
Me?

76
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,680
Yeah.

77
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,980
Look,you've the one who can't even launch a viral
marketing campaign without leaving a phone number.

78
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,990
It's supposed to enter
through the subconscious.

79
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,300
You know,if you have all the
answers,then you book the clients.

80
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:12,380
Just let me know when you've
got some lined up. All right?

81
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,010
I could do that.

82
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:21,210
Oh,crimeny.

83
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,040
Hey,jemma.

84
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,920
Guess you slipped out
pretty quietly this morning.

85
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:29,940
Anyway,looks like some
cash fell out of your purse.

86
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:33,890
But since it did,let me take you out.

87
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,720
Give me a call.

88
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,880
This is ray.

89
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,840
It's almost ready.

90
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,830
It smells good.

91
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,380
anything interesting?

92
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,340
Oh,sorry for snooping.

93
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:05,990
Just,I'm interested in your work.

94
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,670
That's part of a travel
series I did called "bombed."

95
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,940
"Bombed"?

96
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:11,910
You were bombed?

97
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,200
I was bombed,they were bombed.

98
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:19,460
The premise is I go to a war-torn
country and I get drunk with the locals.

99
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,240
Is that was I was?

100
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,860
Another drunk local?

101
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:26,690
No,you-- are
you kidding?

102
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,250
You were art.

103
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,000
What about you?

104
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:37,440
What's your process
like,you know,as a poet?

105
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:41,610
Mmm,I don't have a set process really.

106
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,880
Lately my work's been avoiding me.

107
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,570
How long's it been avoiding you for?

108
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,380
About two years.

109
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,370
Two years?

110
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:55,550
Yeah. I've been pretty blocked.

111
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,300
That's the most tragic
thing I ever heard.

112
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:06,260
I just-- I hate that,when people say
I'm a poet and they don't even write.

113
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,460
When I was a child I
was really prolific.

114
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,560
My adolescence was so fertile.

115
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,030
I hemorrhaged words.

116
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,730
So what stopped the bleeding?

117
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,030
I think it was my mother.

118
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,590
I can't believe we're doing this.

119
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,320
Don't you have a better
way to spend the weekend?

120
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,360
No. No I don'T.

121
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,550
You're my new pet project.

122
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,860
I'm a man on a mission.

123
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,640
We're gonna get you writing again.

124
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:36,820
You don't understand.

125
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,440
My mother's a bitter
academic. Always judges me.

126
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:42,620
So,poets need to suffer.

127
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,730
Okay,listen. Trust me.
This is going to work.

128
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:50,830
You grow as an artist every
time you walk through that door.

129
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,890
Come on.

130
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,070
Mother?

131
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,230
Hello?

132
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,740
Anyone home?

133
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,900
that right there is the
mother of my unborn child.

134
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09,340
Really? The middle finger
to a man you just met?

135
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:12,450
I don't feel like we just met.

136
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,170
"Tanya skagle,state forensics champion."

137
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,770
Oh yeah,proud of it.

138
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,930
First place,dramatic interpretation.

139
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,080
Voted most likely to save the whales.

140
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:28,800
Oh yeah. I really dropped the
ball on those whales though.

141
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,100
Oh wait,see? This is from seventh grade.

142
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:35,050
The year I had really bad B.O. And
my mom wouldn't let me wear deodorant.

143
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,540
I wrote a poem about it.

144
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:39,020
"Indelible stench"?

145
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:46,360
You know... I used to dry hump
my neighbor jacob on this carpet.

146
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,240
You want me to show you how I did it?

147
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,670
Okay,he'd say go.

148
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,740
And then,like...

149
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,920
okay.

150
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:58,050
out of curiosity,did
jacob have any pubic hair?

151
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:04,590
Because I do,and I actually feel like
you're about to start a brush fire.

152
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,950
What,that doesn't do anything for you?

153
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,340
Hello? Is someone here?

154
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,610
Shit. Get up. Get up. Act natural.

155
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,510
Tanya? Is that you?

156
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,170
In my room.

157
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,650
How did I know it was tanya?

158
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,070
I followed the trail.

159
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,760
Dirt all the way up the stairs.

160
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,340
Hi,mom.

161
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,460
Tanya,again with the yearbooks?

162
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:35,190
Oh my god. She loves to take boys
up here and show them the yearbooks.

163
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,310
Hi,mrs. Skagle. I'm pierce.

164
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,240
So nice to meet you.

165
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,560
My goodness,he's a teenager.

166
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:45,180
What are you doing with
an old woman like tanya?

167
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:49,540
I am-- I'm fascinated
with your daughter.

168
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,120
That makes two of us.

169
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,500
New clients.

170
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:06,240
I told tanya I'd find some,but how
the hell was i supposed to do that?

171
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,970
How do you tell when
they're good and firm?

172
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,130
Have a nice day.

173
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,040
Being my own pimp.

174
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,780
It was a little harder than I thought.

175
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:37,490
Mmm,peach.

176
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,760
Smell nice.

177
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,510
Ray!

178
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,070
Jess.

179
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,780
Jesus,what are you doing here?

180
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:04,450
I was just... stocking up.

181
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,070
On flowers?

182
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,830
Yeah,I like flowers.

183
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,140
I thought you were a
meat and potatoes guy.

184
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:13,560
No. Not always.

185
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:14,240
No?

186
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,640
Things change,jess,sometimes.

187
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:20,150
How are you,ray?

188
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,170
Good. I'm good.

189
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,600
No,really. How are you?

190
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,140
I'm really good.

191
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,710
House is shaping up.

192
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:32,230
I think I met someone.

193
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:36,140
- Um,the woman at the game?
- Yeah.

194
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,860
- The blonde.
- I like blondes.

195
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,370
You always did.

196
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,970
Is that who you were
getting flowers for?

197
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,730
Yeah.

198
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,920
You should come by the house sometime.

199
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,700
You mean ronnie's house?

200
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,800
Hey,it's my house too.

201
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,410
Okay. Why?

202
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,530
For dinner.

203
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:58,040
With the kids and ronnie.

204
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,230
We do barbecues every sunday.

205
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,650
I've got a pretty busy schedule,but...

206
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,570
great. Anytime.

207
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,620
And every fucking friday
she has a fucking potluck.

208
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:22,540
But of course she wouldn't invite me
to her party of academics and artists.

209
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,020
Your mother is not the blockage,tanya.

210
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,400
She's the source. She is your muse.

211
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:34,740
No she isn't,pierce. No,she's the bane.

212
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,460
You were prolific under her roof.

213
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,560
So I need you to face your fear
and write a poem about your mother.

214
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:50,190
And we will go over and invite ourselves to her little
party and you will read it in front of all her fancy friends.

215
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:53,650
I mean that is-- that's
a creative breakthrough.

216
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:54,890
Can we talk about something else?

217
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,890
Sure,like what?

218
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,630
Now you're annoyed
with me all of a sudden?

219
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,710
no.

220
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,090
What makes you so different,rita chen?

221
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,330
I want the rita flower
to blossom,not wilt.

222
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,050
Can you excuse me for a second?

223
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,570
What's stopping you from
opening a car wash tomorrow?

224
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,220
An advisor? I'm willing
to be that advisor.

225
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:21,580
- Floyd.
- Tanya. What a surprise.

226
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,670
Tanya,this is one of my
promising new students rita chen.

227
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:28,320
Rita,this is one of my
old students tanya skagle.

228
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,700
So is this what you do?

229
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,670
You butter up your students
and you call them a flower?

230
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,610
Tanya,rita and I are in the
middle of a work session.

231
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,770
I'm sorry,is it rita?

232
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:40,020
Rita. Why don't you ask
him about his millions?

233
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,900
Ask him about his jaguar.

234
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,490
Watch it,sister.

235
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,560
Is everything okay over here?

236
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,900
All right,I think we need
to be alone right now.

237
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,540
But it's great to see you,tanya.

238
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,490
Yeah,well,fuck you,floyd.

239
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,650
jemma,hey.

240
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,910
Sorry I haven't called you earlier.

241
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,980
I've been slammed at work.

242
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:09,450
Oh,no worries.

243
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,400
Me too.

244
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,500
Listen,jemma.

245
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:19,380
I was-- I was meaning
to talk to you.

246
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:23,130
I mean... I like you.

247
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:28,410
And this money thing,it's kind of weird.

248
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,810
Look,I'm saying...

249
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:36,290
I'd like to date you,jemma.

250
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:44,090
So you want me to go on a
real date with you and,like...

251
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:48,090
then maybe I have sex
with you and maybe I don't?

252
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:52,590
well,I think we're a little
beyond the maybe part,but...

253
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,170
oh,ray drecker.

254
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:59,190
You know,when you get all soft and
serious it's very hard to turn you down.

255
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,410
Well,what would we do
on our first real date?

256
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:07,360
I was thinking we'd get
out of the city. You know?

257
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,850
Maybe go for a boat ride.

258
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,050
Maybe pack a picnic.

259
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:17,080
What do you say?

260
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,780
I think...

261
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,630
okay.

262
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:28,960
okay. Okay.

263
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:39,220
Tanya,I can't get you on the phone
so I guess I'll leave it here.

264
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:43,280
Look,I did try to drum
up some new business,okay?

265
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,880
But you're right.

266
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,270
It's a lot harder than I thought.

267
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,330
Hi,neighbor.

268
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,380
Anyway,I'm still trying.

269
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,690
I'm definitely not giving up,all right?

270
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,890
I just want you to know how
much I appreciate all the blood,

271
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:04,750
sweat and tears that you've been
putting into this-- into our project.

272
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,850
I liked your cookies.

273
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,420
Yeah,apparently not enough.

274
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,240
What?

275
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,310
I said I already got two more
citations from your husband since then,

276
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,050
so I guess it didn't do the trick,huh?

277
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:38,970
Yeah,my husband's kind of...obsessive.

278
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:43,460
By the way,I noticed your hot water
heater is just sitting over there.

279
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,390
I'll take care of it,all right?

280
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,650
No need to call anyone.

281
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:53,750
No no,I say this because I was wondering if
you wanted to take a hot shower at our place.

282
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,420
How would your husband feel about that?

283
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,370
Howard's out of town.

284
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,120
Come.

285
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,970
It sure is nice of you to let me
take a hot shower here,mrs.Koontz

286
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:11,570
look,ray,I am sorry
about those citations.

287
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:15,750
Howard,he shouldn't have
called the police,you know?

288
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,170
You need an
extra-- holy cow.

289
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:26,690
Excuse me. I-I-I-I-- I
swear to god,I'm sorry.

290
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,350
I-I wasn't--
shit,ray.

291
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,780
That is one beautiful penis.

292
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,030
Who knew you were hiding that next door?

293
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,070
Thank you,I think.

294
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:48,770
Ray,I was-- I was thinking,you know,we should
try looking out for each other,you and I.

295
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,650
Oh,what do you mean?

296
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:58,260
Like,I could take care of what you
need and you could take care of me.

297
00:18:59,200 --> 00:18:59,940
I don't follow.

298
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:05,000
What do you mean? I scratch your back,you
scratch mine. How is this confusing?

299
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:07,090
I help you out.

300
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,190
And,uh,compensate me.

301
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,170
Is that right,mrs.Koontz?

302
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,490
Yes,ray.

303
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:19,210
Am I making you feel too dirty?

304
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:22,050
I'll live.

305
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,860
Hi,mrs. Skagle.

306
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:29,160
So sorry to interrupt your dinner party,but
we felt bad about eating your cookies.

307
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:33,470
So I baked you new ones. Chocolate chip.

308
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,840
What an unexpected delight.

309
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:38,130
Do these have little sayings in them?

310
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:41,330
No,mother. These have chocolate chips.

311
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:46,370
Look. In times of economic crisis,the
arts are the first thing to go.

312
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,880
I disagree.

313
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:51,400
People need art the most when
they are hungry and afraid.

314
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,690
That depends on your definition of art.

315
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,290
This was a bad idea.

316
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,090
I don't feel well. I feel feverish.

317
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,180
No,you're fine.

318
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:02,200
You're just terrified of
being judged by these people.

319
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:06,280
You know,it's not such a good thing
for your poetry to be such a coward.

320
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:09,390
I am not a coward!

321
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,610
Oh,come on,ray.

322
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:18,400
Come on,ray.

323
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:22,360
I want to see it big and happy.

324
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:40,530
What kind of bed is this?

325
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,910
A stearns & foster.

326
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,120
Why?

327
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:48,510
Because it's fucking
comfortable,that's why.

328
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:54,090
It's the pillow top.

329
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:59,810
Oh,honey,baby,you are beautiful.

330
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,580
I am. I work out seven days a week.

331
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:06,450
But howard likes to fuck in the dark.

332
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,230
Oh,what a waste.

333
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,720
Yeah.

334
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,230
It's
just--

335
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:20,740
oh god. Oh,it is a waste,ray.

336
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,160
I like to be looked at,you know?

337
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,650
I like to be seen.

338
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,650
Oh,god,I'm looking.

339
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,100
I am seeing.

340
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:31,220
Oh shit,ray.

341
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:35,950
oh shit,ray.

342
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,220
oh shit,ray!

343
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,660
My daughter baked these cookies.

344
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:48,910
She sometimes tucks a little
fortune into her baked goods.

345
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,710
But tonight
they're empty--

346
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:53,730
they're chip. I said
they're chip-- --

347
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:58,230
so you don't have to worry
about choking on any words.

348
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:09,450
actually,I did bring some
words for you to choke on.

349
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,320
It's a poem,actually.

350
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,370
Really?

351
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,480
Well,that's great.

352
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,090
Why don't you go ahead and stand up?

353
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,300
Oh,please,honey.

354
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,370
Please,take the floor.

355
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:24,020
Everyone,why don't we give
tanya our full attention?

356
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:26,350
I swear,she doesn't usually do this.

357
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,670
I haven't heard her poetry in 20 years.

358
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:44,330
"Says worker ant to queen...

359
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,950
how now,mother?

360
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,600
There you are

361
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,960
sealed in your chamber

362
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,660
away from the light

363
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:58,530
in this darkness I can see you, mother

364
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,830
but can you see me?

365
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,010
I am shaped in your same image

366
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,920
same fruited wings

367
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:13,020
same swollen belly

368
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:16,480
same brown flesh

369
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:25,150
same chip

370
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,310
same chink

371
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:32,980
you are blind to our efforts

372
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:37,940
can you find nothing in us to love?

373
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:41,830
We are shaped in your image,mother

374
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:48,320
look again look again."

375
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:03,560
thoughts?

376
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,330
It's vaguely reminiscent
of sylvia's "medusa."

377
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,980
Only in this case with ants.

378
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,710
Yes.

379
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:19,250
Its inherent sadness reminded me of a song
the girls of my village used to sing in uganda.

380
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:23,440
Oh,please,would you share it with us?

381
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,770
Please.

382
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,100
It's in swahili.

383
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:30,120
Oh,that's lovely.

384
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,940
I can't compete with this shit.

385
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,650
Hey,tanya!

386
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,730
tanya. Tanya,what--
what is wrong with you?

387
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:16,630
It sucked. My poem sucked.

388
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:19,110
Maybe.

389
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,500
But hey,you started writing again.

390
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,440
I didn't start anything.

391
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:32,370
I wrote that poem when I was 14.

392
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:34,240
I'm a failure.

393
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:39,660
It sucked then and it sucks now.

394
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:42,650
It actually wasn't that bad for 14.

395
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:45,610
I'm not 14,pierce.

396
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:48,860
I'm much much older.

397
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:53,630
I just-- I
want to go home.

398
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:56,580
I just want to go home.

399
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:05,830
So do you want to help
me out now or later?

400
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,960
What do you mean?

401
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:11,040
You know,what we discussed.

402
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:14,000
I take care of you,you take care of me.

403
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,730
Yes,ray,I promise.

404
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,060
No more citations. Okay?

405
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,930
I'll take care of it.

406
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,580
Right,citations.

407
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:28,720
Is that what you meant
by "take care of me"?

408
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:32,390
Yeah. What did you think I meant?

409
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:36,500
So I struck out as my own pimp.

410
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:41,100
But I've got to say,we
each got a bargain.

411
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:49,490
Cinderella had to work through blisters.

412
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:56,740
Cinderella endured two evil stepsisters

413
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:03,450
rapunzel killed 10,000 hours
up atop that locked up tower

414
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:06,960
it's not fair

415
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:10,810
that's a lot of solitaire

416
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:14,960
a lot of braiding her hair

417
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:19,450
it gets lonely up there...

418
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:27,040
Well,we missed the boat,as they say.

419
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:29,360
But no worries.

420
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,710
We'll just catch a later
one when you get here.

421
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:39,450
Little red riding hood was followed

422
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:45,960
little red riding hood's
grandmother was swallowed

423
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:51,810
sleeping beauty got sick from
her stepmom's wicked trick

424
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,190
it's not nice
