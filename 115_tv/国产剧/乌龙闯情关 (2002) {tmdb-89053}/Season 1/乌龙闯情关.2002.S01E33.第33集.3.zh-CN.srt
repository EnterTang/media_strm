1
00:00:07,116 --> 00:00:09,518
The  location
and  size  of the tumor...

2
00:00:09,518 --> 00:00:12,588
make  it  impossible
to  operate

3
00:00:12,588 --> 00:00:14,757
How  long  have  l  got?

4
00:00:14,757 --> 00:00:16,892
That's  hard  to  say

5
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:18,561
How  long?

6
00:00:18,561 --> 00:00:20,426
5  months.  Maybe  6

7
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:25,164
Wow

8
00:00:26,569 --> 00:00:29,238
l  guess the  good  news  is
l  won't  have to  worry...

9
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:31,103
about these  headaches
after  l'm  dead

10
00:00:33,843 --> 00:00:35,743
That was  supposed
to  be  a  joke    doctor

11
00:00:42,551 --> 00:00:44,353
So there's  nothing
you  can  do?

12
00:00:44,353 --> 00:00:45,786
No

13
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:50,426
But we've  got
a  gifted  neurosurgeon...

14
00:00:50,426 --> 00:00:51,694
right  here  in  Memphis

15
00:00:51,694 --> 00:00:55,264
He's found  a  way
to  reduce  cancerous tumors...

16
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:57,466
with  antigens
and  stem  cell  substitution

17
00:00:57,466 --> 00:00:59,502
So  what's the  catch?

18
00:00:59,502 --> 00:01:02,505
Well    treatment  is  still
considered  experimental

19
00:01:02,505 --> 00:01:04,996
lnsurance  won't cover  it

20
00:01:06,242 --> 00:01:07,676
Well    how  expensive  is  it?

21
00:01:07,676 --> 00:01:09,879
Procedure    meds  
and  rehabilitation...

22
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:11,447
run  over  200  000

23
00:01:11,447 --> 00:01:14,116
Can  you  raise
that  kind  of  money?

24
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:16,118
l'm  a  law  clerk    doc

25
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:18,521
l  maxed  out  my credit cards
flying  down  here to  see you

26
00:01:18,521 --> 00:01:20,682
What about your family?

27
00:01:22,058 --> 00:01:23,826
l  don't  have  any family

28
00:01:23,826 --> 00:01:25,487
ls there  anyone?

29
00:01:26,996 --> 00:01:29,396
No    there's  no  one

30
00:01:36,839 --> 00:01:39,842
lt's  a  hell  of a  thing  
doctor

31
00:01:39,842 --> 00:01:41,710
Now that  l  know  l'm  dying...

32
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:45,305
l  realize  l'm  not  leaving
much  of a  life  behind

33
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:49,251
Ray  Ellison
just got the  kind  of  news...

34
00:01:49,251 --> 00:01:51,520
all  of  us  dread...

35
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,923
but on  the  worst day
of  his  life...

36
00:01:53,923 --> 00:01:55,925
Ray  Ellison's  luck
is  about to  change

37
00:01:55,925 --> 00:01:58,227
He's  going  to  have  a  chance
to  save  his future...

38
00:01:58,227 --> 00:02:00,422
by altering  the  past

39
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:15,309
l'm  a  nurse.  Comin' through

40
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:22,251
Who  are you?

41
00:02:22,251 --> 00:02:24,153
My  name's  Adelaide

42
00:02:24,153 --> 00:02:25,754
Are you  in  any  pain?

43
00:02:25,754 --> 00:02:27,556
My  head  hurts

44
00:02:27,556 --> 00:02:29,391
Probably a  concussion

45
00:02:29,391 --> 00:02:31,127
Can  you  tell  me your  name?

46
00:02:31,127 --> 00:02:33,220
lt's  Ray

47
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:36,732
What's  goin'  on?

48
00:02:36,732 --> 00:02:38,567
You  were  hit  by a  car    Ray

49
00:02:38,567 --> 00:02:40,136
Do you  know  what day  it  is?

50
00:02:40,136 --> 00:02:42,238
Hold  on.  Where  am  l?

51
00:02:42,238 --> 00:02:44,306
Memphis.  Jackson  Street

52
00:02:44,306 --> 00:02:45,708
Yeah    but...

53
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,476
why  is  everybody
dressed  like that?

54
00:02:47,476 --> 00:02:48,911
What year  is  it?

55
00:02:48,911 --> 00:02:51,379
lt's  1 968    mister.
Don't you  even  know that?

56
00:02:55,484 --> 00:02:57,319
This  can't－－

57
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:59,014
This  can't  be  happening

58
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:05,194
You're traveling
to  another  dimension...

59
00:03:05,194 --> 00:03:09,465
a  dimension  not only
of sight and  sound...

60
00:03:09,465 --> 00:03:11,490
but of  mind

61
00:03:13,202 --> 00:03:16,705
A journey
into  a  wondrous  land...

62
00:03:16,705 --> 00:03:20,641
whose  boundaries  are  only
that of the  imagination

63
00:03:23,112 --> 00:03:25,342
You're  entering...

64
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,920
You  were  asleep
a  real  long  time

65
00:03:42,064 --> 00:03:43,365
Where  am  l?

66
00:03:43,365 --> 00:03:45,265
My  house

67
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:49,038
You  staring  at  my  birthmark?

68
00:03:49,038 --> 00:03:51,370
No

69
00:03:54,243 --> 00:03:55,972
What time  is  it?

70
00:03:57,246 --> 00:04:00,115
4: 1 5.  Your  watch  is funny

71
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:02,284
lt's  a  digital

72
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:03,842
You've  never  seen  one?

73
00:04:06,388 --> 00:04:08,624
Kid...what year  is this?

74
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:11,794
Already told  you.  lt's  1 968

75
00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:13,062
That can't  be  right

76
00:04:13,062 --> 00:04:14,830
Aah    damn  it

77
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,032
Ooh    you  said  a  bad  word

78
00:04:17,032 --> 00:04:19,368
Lucas    didn't  l  tell  you
to  go  outside  and  play...

79
00:04:19,368 --> 00:04:20,869
so this  man
can  get some  rest?

80
00:04:20,869 --> 00:04:22,004
l  don't wanna  play

81
00:04:22,004 --> 00:04:24,039
Then  go fetch  the  mail  for  me

82
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:25,870
Bye.  Go  on

83
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,777
How's your  head?

84
00:04:28,777 --> 00:04:32,213
lt feels  like  l  just did
1 3  rounds  with  Mike  Tyson

85
00:04:34,617 --> 00:04:37,620
Listen    l  appreciate you
taking  me  in  and  everything...

86
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,054
but...

87
00:04:39,054 --> 00:04:40,990
maybe  l  should
be  in  a  hospital

88
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,225
The  colored  hospital's
too far to  go to today

89
00:04:43,225 --> 00:04:44,426
The  what?

90
00:04:44,426 --> 00:04:45,427
The  colored  hospital

91
00:04:45,427 --> 00:04:46,962
But  if you
still  wanna  go tomorrow...

92
00:04:46,962 --> 00:04:48,764
we  can  work  something  out

93
00:04:48,764 --> 00:04:50,432
l  think  it's just
a  concussion  though

94
00:04:50,432 --> 00:04:52,568
No    no    something's  not  right

95
00:04:52,568 --> 00:04:54,336
l'm  not supposed  to  be  here

96
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,138
Listen    mister...

97
00:04:56,138 --> 00:04:57,673
l  know  my  house
is  nothing  fancy    but－－

98
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:58,941
no    l'm  not talking
about your  house

99
00:04:58,941 --> 00:05:01,143
l  mean    none  of this
makes  sense

100
00:05:01,143 --> 00:05:03,712
This  nonsense
about  it  being  1 968

101
00:05:03,712 --> 00:05:05,581
lt  is  1 968

102
00:05:05,581 --> 00:05:06,982
Look    lady    l'm  not crazy...

103
00:05:06,982 --> 00:05:08,415
and  l'm  not  hallucinating.  Ow

104
00:05:09,718 --> 00:05:11,353
Look    just...

105
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:12,821
l'll  prove  it

106
00:05:12,821 --> 00:05:13,889
Look...

107
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:15,516
can  you  hand  me
my jacket    please?

108
00:05:17,493 --> 00:05:19,061
Here

109
00:05:19,061 --> 00:05:20,050
Thank you

110
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:23,932
Where's  my wallet?

111
00:05:23,932 --> 00:05:26,526
Maybe you  lost  it
when  you  got  hit

112
00:05:29,405 --> 00:05:30,773
Once you  get some  solid  rest...

113
00:05:30,773 --> 00:05:32,408
you'll  start to feel
a  lot  better

114
00:05:32,408 --> 00:05:34,501
Supper  will  be  ready
in  an  hour

115
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:51,700

116
00:05:52,161 --> 00:05:55,130
You  certainly eat
like  a  healthy  man

117
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,564
You  should  be fine
in  a  day or two

118
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,528
That depends  on
your  definition  of “fine”

119
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:05,634
You  have  any Advil?

120
00:06:06,642 --> 00:06:08,906
Uh    aspirin?

121
00:06:10,012 --> 00:06:12,037
Got some  in  my  purse

122
00:06:16,218 --> 00:06:18,320
Time for your  bath    young  man

123
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,321
Oh    mama    it's  still  early

124
00:06:19,321 --> 00:06:20,622
l  don't wanna  take
my  bath  right  now

125
00:06:20,622 --> 00:06:21,611
Lucas    don't－－

126
00:06:22,725 --> 00:06:24,625
Lucas    don't argue  with  me

127
00:06:27,696 --> 00:06:29,198
l'm  gonna  fill  the tub

128
00:06:29,198 --> 00:06:30,563
Excuse  me

129
00:06:36,505 --> 00:06:38,374
Your  mama's  a  nice  lady

130
00:06:38,374 --> 00:06:40,433
Yeah    pretty    too

131
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,979
She's  usually
even  nicer than  this...

132
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:45,247
but she's  upset
'cause  she  got...

133
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,515
another  one  of those
letters today

134
00:06:46,515 --> 00:06:47,616
What  letter?

135
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,351
Some  people tryin'
to take  our  house

136
00:06:49,351 --> 00:06:52,154
She  keeps  callin' the  lawyer  
but  he  won't call  her  back

137
00:06:52,154 --> 00:06:53,822
You  know  where
this  letter  is?

138
00:06:53,822 --> 00:06:55,813
－lt's  over  here.
－Let  me  see  it

139
00:06:59,228 --> 00:07:00,786
Thank you

140
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:17,546
You  should  be  asleep

141
00:07:17,546 --> 00:07:19,748
Yeah    l  know

142
00:07:19,748 --> 00:07:22,551
You  never  did  ask  me
what  l  do for  a  living

143
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:24,086
l'm  a  law  clerk

144
00:07:24,086 --> 00:07:25,854
l  mean  
that's  what  l  do.  l...

145
00:07:25,854 --> 00:07:27,856
look  at  legal  documents

146
00:07:27,856 --> 00:07:29,158
like these  all  day  long

147
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:30,692
l  figured
the  least  l  could  do...

148
00:07:30,692 --> 00:07:31,960
to  repay you
for your  kindness...

149
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,729
was to  give you
some free  advice

150
00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:36,432
Where'd  you  get that from?

151
00:07:36,432 --> 00:07:39,890
That  letter's
none  of your  business

152
00:07:41,403 --> 00:07:43,372
l  take  a  stranger
into  my  house...

153
00:07:43,372 --> 00:07:45,874
out of the  goodness
of  my  heart...

154
00:07:45,874 --> 00:07:48,843
and  he  snoops  around
in  my  private  affairs

155
00:07:50,646 --> 00:07:53,410
l'm  of a  mind
to  put you  out  right  now

156
00:07:57,219 --> 00:08:00,382
Even  if  l  can  tell  you
how to  save your  house?

157
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:06,862
Lucas    how  many times
l  done told  you...

158
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:08,163
about  bouncing  that  ball
up  against the  house?

159
00:08:08,163 --> 00:08:09,264
Sorry    mama

160
00:08:09,264 --> 00:08:10,599
l'll  be  down  at City  Hall
most of the  day

161
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:12,067
l  left some  lunch
for you  in  the  icebox...

162
00:08:12,067 --> 00:08:13,502
and  l  want your
math  and  reading  done...

163
00:08:13,502 --> 00:08:14,670
when  l  get  home

164
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,172
-Yes    ma'am.
－Now  come  here  and  gimme  a  kiss

165
00:08:17,172 --> 00:08:18,507
Mama!

166
00:08:18,507 --> 00:08:20,676
Boy    you  better  get your  little
narrow  behind  over  here...

167
00:08:20,676 --> 00:08:22,166
and  give your  mama
a  good－luck  kiss

168
00:08:24,913 --> 00:08:26,181
And  comb your  hair for  me

169
00:08:26,181 --> 00:08:27,170
Yes    ma'am

170
00:08:28,183 --> 00:08:29,673
Give  'em  hell    Adelaide

171
00:08:37,192 --> 00:08:38,393
Hey    Lucas

172
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:39,382
Hey    Ray

173
00:08:40,596 --> 00:08:41,930
You  think you  could
tell  me  how to  get  back...

174
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,198
to  where  l  had
my accident yesterday?

175
00:08:43,198 --> 00:08:44,366
Sure.  All  you  gotta  do...

176
00:08:44,366 --> 00:08:45,701
is  go to that street
and  keep  walkin'

177
00:08:45,701 --> 00:08:47,069
OK.  Thanks

178
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:49,371
Uh    listen    Lucas...

179
00:08:49,371 --> 00:08:51,139
there's  a  good  chance
that you  won't see  me  again

180
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:52,574
Why  not?

181
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:55,010
Because there's  someplace  else
l'm  supposed  to  be

182
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:57,103
How  do you  know?  Maybe
you're  supposed  to  be  here

183
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,515
l  don't think  so

184
00:08:59,515 --> 00:09:01,283
Well    can  l  go  with  you?

185
00:09:01,283 --> 00:09:04,253
lf you  do that who's  gonna
take  care  of your  mama?

186
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:05,654
lf  l  don't come  back...

187
00:09:05,654 --> 00:09:07,519
you  tell  her  l  said
thanks for  everything    OK?

188
00:09:48,864 --> 00:09:50,432
Come to the  rally
tonight    brother

189
00:09:50,432 --> 00:09:51,456
All  right

190
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,383
Can  l  help you?

191
00:10:08,383 --> 00:10:09,885
No    l'm  just  looking
for  something

192
00:10:09,885 --> 00:10:11,887
Well    you  can't  be
messin'  around  in  there...

193
00:10:11,887 --> 00:10:13,221
scarin' folks.
Come  on  out there  now

194
00:10:13,221 --> 00:10:14,423
Well    l  lost－－

195
00:10:14,423 --> 00:10:16,258
l  lost  my wallet
here yesterday

196
00:10:16,258 --> 00:10:17,926
l  was just  looking  for  it

197
00:10:17,926 --> 00:10:19,154
Let  me  see  some  l.D

198
00:10:21,463 --> 00:10:22,898
My  l.D.  would  be
in  my wallet...

199
00:10:22,898 --> 00:10:24,695
which  is  what  l  just
told  you  l  lost

200
00:10:26,068 --> 00:10:27,903
This  is  public  property...

201
00:10:27,903 --> 00:10:29,237
isn't  it?

202
00:10:29,237 --> 00:10:31,364
Are you  questionin'  me    boy?

203
00:10:33,141 --> 00:10:35,006
What did  you  call  me?

204
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:39,081
Uncle  Ray...

205
00:10:39,081 --> 00:10:40,248
mama  said  the  movie
starts  in  5  minutes

206
00:10:40,248 --> 00:10:42,409
We  gotta  hurry  if we  wanna
get our tickets

207
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,588
Hello    Officer  Bryant

208
00:10:46,588 --> 00:10:48,190
Lucas    you  know  him?

209
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,125
Yes    sir.  He's  my  uncle
from  New York

210
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,560
Officer:  Well...

211
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,995
tell  your  uncle...

212
00:10:52,995 --> 00:10:55,097
he's  in  Memphis  now    ya  hear?

213
00:10:55,097 --> 00:10:56,189
Yes    sir

214
00:11:08,076 --> 00:11:10,579
You're  not  mad  at  me
for following  you?

215
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:13,382
No.  No

216
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:16,118
Just wonderin'  if you  figured
out where you're  supposed  to  be

217
00:11:16,118 --> 00:11:18,253
Well    l  know  where
you're  supposed  to  be

218
00:11:18,253 --> 00:11:19,888
Your  mama  comes  home
and  finds you  gone...

219
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:21,156
she's  gonna  kill  us  both

220
00:11:21,156 --> 00:11:22,487
Come  on

221
00:11:31,466 --> 00:11:35,203
Where  l'm  from  
things  are  different

222
00:11:35,203 --> 00:11:37,305
They're  different from
the  way they are  here

223
00:11:37,305 --> 00:11:39,741
You  talk to  people
in  a  different way...

224
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:42,411
and  police  aren't supposed
to talk to you  like that

225
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:44,579
You  weren't
scared  of that cop?

226
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,979
When  you  know you're  right
you  don't  need  to  be  scared

227
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,353
Aren't you  supposed
to  be  in  school  or  something?

228
00:11:51,353 --> 00:11:52,921
They sent  me  home yesterday...

229
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,190
'cause  l  got  into  a  fight

230
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,192
What about?

231
00:11:57,192 --> 00:11:58,591
Nothing

232
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:02,419
Nothing's  a  pretty
empty thing  to fight for

233
00:12:04,232 --> 00:12:06,234
Bobby Wilson  was  makin'
fun  of  my  birthmark...

234
00:12:06,234 --> 00:12:07,536
so  l  punched  him
in  the  stomach

235
00:12:07,536 --> 00:12:09,638
Mama  always
tellin'  me  not to fight...

236
00:12:09,638 --> 00:12:11,071
but she just don't  understand

237
00:12:12,074 --> 00:12:14,009
Can't  be  a  man
without fighting

238
00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:15,043
See    that's  what  l  told  her

239
00:12:15,043 --> 00:12:16,111
Yeah    but the  secret  is...

240
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:18,447
a  real  man  doesn't
use  his fists to fight

241
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:20,615
Look    you  fight with  these...

242
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:22,417
you  can  change things
maybe for  a  few  minutes...

243
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:24,519
but you  use this  and  this...

244
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:27,823
change things forever.
You  could  change your  life

245
00:12:27,823 --> 00:12:29,524
You  understand
what  l'm  saying?

246
00:12:29,524 --> 00:12:31,219
Yeah    l  think  so

247
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:35,030
Wanna  know  a  secret?

248
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,231
What  kind  of secret?

249
00:12:36,231 --> 00:12:38,667
What  l  wanna  be
when  l  grow  up

250
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:39,968
OK

251
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:42,459
You  gotta  promise  me
you  won't  laugh

252
00:12:45,107 --> 00:12:46,870
Ok    l  promise

253
00:12:53,415 --> 00:12:55,484
That's  a  pretty  big  dream

254
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:57,111
l  know

255
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,387
You  ready to fight for  it?

256
00:12:59,387 --> 00:13:00,649
Yes    sir

257
00:13:16,872 --> 00:13:17,861
Hey    mama

258
00:13:20,242 --> 00:13:22,540
What  happened?
They gave you  the  runaround?

259
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,014
l'll  go  back  down  there
in  the  morning  with  you

260
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,811
Runaround

261
00:13:29,117 --> 00:13:31,853
Shoot    those  white folks
didn't  know  what  hit 'em!

262
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,388
l  told  'em  exactly
what you  said

263
00:13:33,388 --> 00:13:35,023
How they can't
foreclose  on  the  house...

264
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,358
while  it's
still  in  litigation

265
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:38,360
Then  l  whipped  out
a  copy of  my  bank  statement...

266
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,061
to  prove to them
that  l  had  the tax  money

267
00:13:40,061 --> 00:13:41,496
Ha  ha

268
00:13:41,496 --> 00:13:43,765
l  thought  l  was  gonna  have to
nurse them  back to  health...

269
00:13:43,765 --> 00:13:45,066
after  l  was
finished  with  'em

270
00:13:45,066 --> 00:13:46,301
l'm  happy for you    Adelaide

271
00:13:46,301 --> 00:13:47,702
Thank you    Ray

272
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,604
Mama    we  gonna  keep  our  house?

273
00:13:49,604 --> 00:13:51,239
You  better  believe
we  are    baby

274
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:52,474
Ha  ha  ha!

275
00:13:52,474 --> 00:13:53,875
Now...

276
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,578
l'm  about to  walk
through  my  front door...

277
00:13:56,578 --> 00:13:58,213
and  into  my  kitchen...

278
00:13:58,213 --> 00:13:59,881
and  l'm  gonna  cook y'all

279
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:01,917
the  best  meal  y'all  ever  had!

280
00:14:01,917 --> 00:14:03,248
Whoo!

281
00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:22,404
He  was  so tired...

282
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:23,939
he fell  asleep
in  his  clothes

283
00:14:23,939 --> 00:14:26,107
l'll  carry  him
to  his  bed  later

284
00:14:26,107 --> 00:14:27,506
l  appreciate that    Ray

285
00:14:29,477 --> 00:14:31,112
Lucas  really  likes you

286
00:14:31,112 --> 00:14:32,647
Hey    l  really  like  him

287
00:14:32,647 --> 00:14:34,015
He's  a  great  kid    Adelaide

288
00:14:34,015 --> 00:14:36,418
Just  like  his  daddy

289
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:39,020
You  mind  me  asking  what
happened  to  his father?

290
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,356
Jim  was  a  window  washer

291
00:14:41,356 --> 00:14:43,325
5 years  ago...

292
00:14:43,325 --> 00:14:45,560
he  was  working  on  one  of those
office  buildings  downtown...

293
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,822
and  his  cable  broke

294
00:14:48,463 --> 00:14:50,988
No  one  was  willing  to take  him
to  a  colored  hospital

295
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:54,192
Died  right there  in  the  street

296
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,564
l'm  sorry to  hear that

297
00:14:59,841 --> 00:15:02,544
l  want a  different
kind  of  life for  Lucas

298
00:15:02,544 --> 00:15:04,546
They say
times  are  changing    but－－

299
00:15:04,546 --> 00:15:07,015
Oh    they are.  They are

300
00:15:07,015 --> 00:15:08,505
l  promise you

301
00:15:09,584 --> 00:15:11,486
So  what about you?

302
00:15:11,486 --> 00:15:14,256
Got somebody
waitin'  at  home for ya?

303
00:15:14,256 --> 00:15:15,557
Nah

304
00:15:15,557 --> 00:15:17,855
Too  busy
playin' the field    huh?

305
00:15:20,362 --> 00:15:23,365
Well  
l  guess  it's    uh...

306
00:15:23,365 --> 00:15:24,399
too  late  now

307
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,196
Why do you  say that?

308
00:15:32,707 --> 00:15:34,976
Adelaide    do you
think  it's  possible－－

309
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:37,412
well...

310
00:15:37,412 --> 00:15:38,747
do you  think  it's  possible...

311
00:15:38,747 --> 00:15:40,582
for  a  person  to  get
a  second  chance?

312
00:15:40,582 --> 00:15:44,319
l  think  if a  person
has  God  in  their  heart...

313
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:46,488
they get  more
than  a  second  chance

314
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:49,150
They get a  fresh  start

315
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:54,185
Fresh  start

316
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:58,133
l'd  love that

317
00:15:58,133 --> 00:15:59,896
lt's  never too  late

318
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:05,740
Oh    my God

319
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,842
Ray    what's  wrong?

320
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:10,378
Tomorrow's  April  4    1 968

321
00:16:10,378 --> 00:16:11,970
And?

322
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:15,417
Martin  Luther  King's
gonna  be  assassinated...

323
00:16:15,417 --> 00:16:17,715
here  in  Memphis

324
00:16:20,388 --> 00:16:21,456
l  don't  understand

325
00:16:21,456 --> 00:16:23,692
What do you  mean  somebody's
gonna  kill  Dr.  King?

326
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:25,727
Tonight  he's  speaking  to
the  striking  sanitation  workers

327
00:16:25,727 --> 00:16:26,728
Tomorrow  he's  gonna
be  murdered...

328
00:16:26,728 --> 00:16:28,096
on  the  balcony
of the  Lorraine  Motel

329
00:16:28,096 --> 00:16:29,297
How  do you  know this?

330
00:16:29,297 --> 00:16:30,298
Because  remember
when  l  told  you...

331
00:16:30,298 --> 00:16:31,299
l'm  not supposed  to  be  here?

332
00:16:31,299 --> 00:16:32,767
Adelaide  
l'm  not from  this time

333
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,602
l  woke  up yesterday  morning  
it was  2003

334
00:16:34,602 --> 00:16:35,937
Now  somehow this  accident－－

335
00:16:35,937 --> 00:16:37,539
Ray    you're  not  makin'
any  kinda  sense－－

336
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:39,908
No    l－－l  am.  Adelaide  
listen  to  me.  Listen  to  me

337
00:16:39,908 --> 00:16:41,710
Now  l－－l've  been  trying
to figure  out why  l'm  here

338
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,211
l  thought  it  had  something
to  do  with  you  and  Lucas

339
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:44,512
Ray－－

340
00:16:44,512 --> 00:16:45,714
maybe  l  was  supposed
to  help you    but－－

341
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:47,204
No    l'm  not  in  pain!
Just  list－－

342
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:51,052
l'm  sorry...

343
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:53,254
but    Adelaide  
l've  gotta  save  King

344
00:16:53,254 --> 00:16:55,223
Now  which  way
to the  Mason  temple?

345
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:57,225
Ray    you  need  to  rest

346
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:58,493
No    l  don't

347
00:16:58,493 --> 00:17:00,362
Adelaide...

348
00:17:00,362 --> 00:17:03,465
you  gotta  trust  me

349
00:17:03,465 --> 00:17:05,500
Please

350
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,569
lt's  2  miles from  here

351
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,230
On  Mason  Street

352
00:17:13,808 --> 00:17:15,477
Martin  Luther  King :
Like  anybody...

353
00:17:15,477 --> 00:17:17,679
l  would  like to  live...

354
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,615
a  long  life.  Longevity...

355
00:17:20,615 --> 00:17:23,251
has  its  place...

356
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,820
but  l'm  not
concerned  about that  now

357
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,591
l  just want to  do  God's  will...

358
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:32,093
and  he's  allowed  me...

359
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:34,229
to  go  up to the  mountain

360
00:17:34,229 --> 00:17:36,398
And  l've  looked  over...

361
00:17:36,398 --> 00:17:39,768
and  l've  seen...

362
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,236
the  promised  land...

363
00:17:41,236 --> 00:17:42,737
Whoa    there.  We're full  up

364
00:17:42,737 --> 00:17:43,872
This  is  an  emergency

365
00:17:43,872 --> 00:17:45,040
l  just  have to  get  in
for  5  minutes

366
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,041
Yeah    and  l  just told  you
there's  no  room

367
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,042
No    officer  
you  don't  understand

368
00:17:47,042 --> 00:17:48,043
Just    please    listen  to  me－－

369
00:17:48,043 --> 00:17:49,044
No    you  don't  understand

370
00:17:49,044 --> 00:17:50,045
All  these  people
wanna  get  in  to  see－－

371
00:17:50,045 --> 00:17:51,046
l  gotta  get  in  here!

372
00:17:51,046 --> 00:17:52,213
You  don't  understand!
Just  listen  to  me!

373
00:17:52,213 --> 00:17:53,948
They're  gonna  kill  him!
They're  gonna  kill  King!

374
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:56,418
l'm  not crazy!
They're  gonna  kill  him!

375
00:17:56,418 --> 00:17:57,619
No  one's  gonna  kill  anybody!

376
00:17:57,619 --> 00:18:00,588
Listen  to  me!
Listen  to  me!

377
00:18:00,588 --> 00:18:03,892
King :  So  l'm  happy tonight  
l'm  not worried...

378
00:18:03,892 --> 00:18:06,895
about anything!
l'm  not fearing  any  man!

379
00:18:06,895 --> 00:18:09,664
My eyes
have  seen  the  glory...

380
00:18:09,664 --> 00:18:10,995
of the  coming  of the  Lord

381
00:18:16,171 --> 00:18:17,505
Thanks for  bailing  me  out

382
00:18:17,505 --> 00:18:18,873
l'll  pay you  back.  l  promise

383
00:18:18,873 --> 00:18:20,208
That's  not  important

384
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:22,210
Listen    Adelaide  
l'm  sorry about all  of this

385
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:25,338
l  need  you  to  know  something.
l'm  not crazy

386
00:18:27,015 --> 00:18:29,117
l  care  about you  and  Lucas

387
00:18:29,117 --> 00:18:31,152
l  gotta  get to
the  Lorraine  Motel

388
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:33,950
We're  never  going
to  see you  again    are  we?

389
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,550
l  don't  know

390
00:18:39,627 --> 00:18:41,822
Thank you  for  everything  
Adelaide

391
00:18:46,367 --> 00:18:47,702
Lucas    what are
you  doing  here?

392
00:18:47,702 --> 00:18:49,204
l  heard  what you  told  my  mom
last  night.  l  wanna  help

393
00:18:49,204 --> 00:18:50,672
No    you  can't!  Go  back  home!

394
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:53,341
Ray    you're  supposed
to  be  here  with  us!  l  know  it

395
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:54,409
Lucas    listen  to  me

396
00:18:54,409 --> 00:18:56,077
Don't forget
what  l  told  you    OK?

397
00:18:56,077 --> 00:18:57,245
You  fight for  what you  want

398
00:18:57,245 --> 00:18:58,610
Don't forget that

399
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:30,912
Dr.  King!

400
00:19:30,912 --> 00:19:32,313
Go  inside!

401
00:19:32,313 --> 00:19:33,715
Get off the  balcony!

402
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:35,383
Dr.  King!

403
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,118
Dr.  King    go  inside!

404
00:19:37,118 --> 00:19:38,920
Get off the－－

405
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,755
go  inside!

406
00:19:40,755 --> 00:19:41,990
Ray!

407
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,758
No    Lucas    go  back!

408
00:19:43,758 --> 00:19:45,493

Dr.  King    go  inside!

410
00:19:47,795 --> 00:19:49,264
No!  No!

411
00:19:49,264 --> 00:19:51,892
Wait!  Ray    wait!

412
00:19:53,801 --> 00:19:54,961
No!

413
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:04,145
Ray!  Ray    are you  all  right?

414
00:20:04,145 --> 00:20:06,247
You  gotta  stop  'em

415
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:08,238
You  gotta  save  him.
Ya  gotta－－

416
00:20:10,785 --> 00:20:13,549
Oh    my goodness!
They shot  Dr.  King!

417
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:20,028
l  didn't save  King

418
00:20:20,028 --> 00:20:22,564
But you  saved  me    Ray

419
00:20:22,564 --> 00:20:25,124
Thank you  for  saving  me

420
00:20:40,181 --> 00:20:42,050
Welcome  back to the  living

421
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,452
You  were  in  a  coma  for  3  days

422
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:47,322
A  coma?

423
00:20:47,322 --> 00:20:49,017
But  l  was－－

424
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:51,793
l－－l  was－－

425
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:53,761
How  do you  feel?

426
00:20:56,331 --> 00:20:57,865
My  head  hurts

427
00:20:57,865 --> 00:20:59,300
Yeah

428
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,668
Well    l've  got some  good  news

429
00:21:00,668 --> 00:21:02,804
l  got your  case  reviewed

430
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:04,572
That specialist
l  told  you  about...

431
00:21:04,572 --> 00:21:06,107
has  agreed
to  underwrite the  cost

432
00:21:06,107 --> 00:21:07,775
What?

433
00:21:07,775 --> 00:21:10,178
lt's  a  new  program
he's  starting...

434
00:21:10,178 --> 00:21:11,913
to  benefit
people  like yourself...

435
00:21:11,913 --> 00:21:15,216
people  who  need  treatment
but can't afford  it

436
00:21:15,216 --> 00:21:18,286
Won't cost you  a  dime

437
00:21:18,286 --> 00:21:21,522
You  better  pinch  me    doctor.
l  think  l'm  still  dreaming

438
00:21:21,522 --> 00:21:24,650
Ha  ha  ha.  Trust  me  
you're  wide  awake

439
00:21:26,361 --> 00:21:29,063
Ray    l'd  like you
to  meet your  new  physician :

440
00:21:29,063 --> 00:21:30,928
Dr.  Lucas  Tyler

441
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:33,825
Nice to  meet you    Ray

442
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:37,071
Lucas?

443
00:21:37,071 --> 00:21:39,407
Now    l  don't want you
to  worry about anything

444
00:21:39,407 --> 00:21:41,109
The  only thing  you  have to  do...

445
00:21:41,109 --> 00:21:42,543
is fight to  get well

446
00:21:42,543 --> 00:21:46,014
Now    you  fight
from  here  and  from  here...

447
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:48,082
and  you  can  change your  life

448
00:21:48,082 --> 00:21:49,481
Don't forget that

449
00:21:52,754 --> 00:21:54,949
l  won't forget

450
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:04,132
l  won't forget

451
00:22:04,132 --> 00:22:06,334
Ray  Ellison  was
looking  for  a  fresh  start...

452
00:22:06,334 --> 00:22:09,237
and  he  only  had  to  go  back
35 years to find  one

453
00:22:09,237 --> 00:22:11,272
Sometimes the  key
to  our future...

454
00:22:11,272 --> 00:22:12,674
lies  in  the  past

455
00:22:12,674 --> 00:22:15,939
