00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,366
You've  still  got
a  few  minutes

3
00:00:29,403 --> 00:00:30,631
So?

4
00:00:30,671 --> 00:00:32,036
Well    maybe you  want
to  look  it over...

5
00:00:32,072 --> 00:00:33,096
one  more time?

6
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,631
Ah    l  didn't study

7
00:00:39,713 --> 00:00:41,510
Ben    this test
counts for  a  third...

8
00:00:41,548 --> 00:00:43,675
of your final  grade

9
00:00:43,717 --> 00:00:45,685
l'll  have
to  give you  an  “F.”

10
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:46,947
Yeah    that's  OK

Answer
the  immortal  question :

13
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:56,489
lf they  had  lived...

14
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,361
would  Romeo  and  Juliet
have  stayed  together...

15
00:00:58,398 --> 00:01:00,093
or  were they just
Shakespeare's  version...

16
00:01:00,133 --> 00:01:01,361
of Justin  and  Britney?

17
00:01:05,105 --> 00:01:07,369
Romeo  and  Juliet
killed  themselves...

18
00:01:07,407 --> 00:01:10,399
'cause they were  ass  hats

19
00:01:14,214 --> 00:01:16,341
Smile.  Your  day's
officially over

20
00:01:16,383 --> 00:01:18,078
l'm  not smiling  till
next week    when  my days...

21
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:20,484
as  a  high  school  teacher
are  officially over

22
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,488
What did  the  little  rat
bastards  do this time?

23
00:01:22,522 --> 00:01:24,490
Please.  They don't
do  anything

24
00:01:24,524 --> 00:01:26,719
They don't work.
They don't  listen

25
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,057
They don't care

26
00:01:28,095 --> 00:01:30,120
And    as  of  next week  
neither  do  l

27
00:01:30,163 --> 00:01:32,324
You're  burned  out    that's
all.  You  need  a  break

28
00:01:32,366 --> 00:01:33,833
A  permanent  break

29
00:01:33,867 --> 00:01:35,630
You  take the job  seriously

30
00:01:35,669 --> 00:01:37,034
That's  what  makes you
a  great teacher

31
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,537
Past tense    please

32
00:01:38,572 --> 00:01:39,732
OK.  Fine

33
00:01:39,773 --> 00:01:42,765
That's  what  made  you
a  great teacher

34
00:01:42,809 --> 00:01:45,004
Deep  down    you  love the
little  rat  bastards...

35
00:01:45,045 --> 00:01:46,706
and  they  love you

36
00:01:55,822 --> 00:01:57,449
Uhh!

37
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,555
Oh    yeah.
They  love  me    all  right

38
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,396
They  love  me  so  much

39
00:02:07,434 --> 00:02:09,368
Meet  Rachel  Stark

40
00:02:09,403 --> 00:02:11,394
She  may think  she's  ready
to  quite  her job...

41
00:02:11,438 --> 00:02:14,498
and  leave  her  students
behind    but today...

42
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:18,307
this teacher's  gonna  learn
a  lesson  in  commitment...

Hey    geek

45
00:02:37,164 --> 00:02:39,394
Slow  down    Jose

46
00:02:51,712 --> 00:02:53,441
Why don't you
turn  that thing  down?

47
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,281
Do  something  back  here  
would  you?!

48
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:01,446
l  paid  my fare!
l  got  my  rights!

49
00:03:01,488 --> 00:03:03,888
Maybe you  should  calm  down

50
00:03:03,924 --> 00:03:04,982
Call  the  cops!

51
00:03:05,025 --> 00:03:07,050
l  want these  kids
off the  bus    right  now!

52
00:03:07,094 --> 00:03:08,220
Oh    God

53
00:03:28,482 --> 00:03:32,543
You're traveling
to  another  dimension...

54
00:03:32,586 --> 00:03:36,283
a  dimension  not only
of sight and  sound...

55
00:03:36,323 --> 00:03:37,756
but of  mind

56
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:42,287
A journey  into
a  wondrous  land...

57
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:46,493
whose  boundaries  are  only
that of the  imagination

58
00:03:49,202 --> 00:03:51,102
You're  entering...

59
00:04:01,214 --> 00:04:03,512
That smells  really good

60
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,211
You're  late

61
00:04:05,252 --> 00:04:08,119
Yes    l  am.
Uh    game  went  into  overtime

62
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:11,257
And  we  still  lost

63
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,623
Uh...oh    and  then
l  heard  about your  car

64
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,093
That sucks

65
00:04:15,128 --> 00:04:16,288
Yeah

66
00:04:17,597 --> 00:04:18,791
You  all  right?

67
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:23,068
Something  happened
on  the  way  home

68
00:04:23,103 --> 00:04:26,163
There  was  a  man  on  the  bus

69
00:04:26,206 --> 00:04:28,333
He  had  a  heart attack.
l  tried  to  give  him  CPR...

70
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:31,208
but...he  died

71
00:04:31,244 --> 00:04:34,509
That  must  have  been  awful

72
00:04:34,548 --> 00:04:35,742
lt was

73
00:04:37,317 --> 00:04:39,842
Have you  ever
seen  anyone  die?

74
00:04:39,886 --> 00:04:42,684
Yeah    my grandfather  
when  l  was  1 0

75
00:04:42,722 --> 00:04:46,089
Did  anything...weird  happen?

76
00:04:47,761 --> 00:04:48,750
Weird  how?

77
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,630
Before the  man  died...

78
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,861
l  saw this...

79
00:04:54,901 --> 00:04:57,631
light around  his face

80
00:04:57,671 --> 00:04:59,161
Like  a  halo?

81
00:04:59,206 --> 00:05:01,800
Less  cheesy    but    yeah

82
00:05:03,176 --> 00:05:04,165
That's  weird

83
00:05:06,046 --> 00:05:07,946
The thing  is    l  saw
the  light on  Jose    too

84
00:05:07,981 --> 00:05:10,006
Who?

85
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,608
Jose  Molina

86
00:05:11,651 --> 00:05:13,619
Sophomore.  One  of  my
English  Lit  kids

87
00:05:13,653 --> 00:05:16,213
He  was  riding
his  skateboard

88
00:05:16,256 --> 00:05:19,487
l  thought  it was just
something  in  my eye    but...

89
00:05:19,526 --> 00:05:21,187
What?

90
00:05:22,462 --> 00:05:23,451
Nothing

91
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:27,791
Hey    Jose  was just fine

92
00:05:27,834 --> 00:05:29,461
l  was  kind  of counting
on  you  to  laugh...

93
00:05:29,503 --> 00:05:31,266
and  tell  me  it
was  all  in  my  head

94
00:05:31,304 --> 00:05:33,363
l'm  sure  it  is

95
00:05:34,374 --> 00:05:36,365
But  l  don't think
it's  a  coincidence...

96
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:38,070
that you're－-you're
seeing  strange  lights...

97
00:05:38,111 --> 00:05:40,841
right after  giving
notice  at the  school

98
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:42,473
Meaning?

99
00:05:42,516 --> 00:05:44,279
Meaning    uh...

100
00:05:44,317 --> 00:05:46,547
maybe you're feeling
a  little  guilty

101
00:05:48,154 --> 00:05:49,121
What for?

102
00:05:49,155 --> 00:05:51,180
For  leaving  the  kids...

103
00:05:51,224 --> 00:05:53,124
for  giving  up  on  teaching

104
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,922
Whatever you  say...

105
00:05:54,961 --> 00:05:56,826
you  still  started  out
like the  rest of  us...

106
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,160
wanting  to  make
a  difference

107
00:05:58,198 --> 00:06:00,223
lt's－－it's  gonna
be  hard  to  let that go

108
00:06:00,267 --> 00:06:02,701
Well    here  l  am...

109
00:06:02,736 --> 00:06:04,601
letting  go

110
00:06:04,638 --> 00:06:06,663
Those  kids  will  be
just fine  without  me...

111
00:06:06,706 --> 00:06:09,402
and  l'll  be  more than  fine
without them

112
00:06:11,011 --> 00:06:13,946
l  just  had
a  weird  afternoon

113
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,140
That's  all

114
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:34,767
So  why does  Mercutio  say...

115
00:06:34,801 --> 00:06:36,996
“A  plague  on  both
your  houses”?

116
00:06:39,973 --> 00:06:42,339
He  wanted  everyone  dead

117
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:45,139
But  Romeo  was
his friend    right?

118
00:06:45,178 --> 00:06:47,669
Why would  he
want  his friend  to  die?

119
00:06:49,482 --> 00:06:51,006
Arlie?

120
00:06:51,051 --> 00:06:54,714
Um    Mercutio  was  dying

121
00:06:54,754 --> 00:06:56,119
He  was  all  alone

122
00:06:56,156 --> 00:06:57,646
He  didn't
have  any friends

123
00:06:57,691 --> 00:06:59,283
Bet you  know  what
that feels  like    huh?

124
00:06:59,326 --> 00:07:00,452
－Shut  up.
－Brian－－

125
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,309
Ms.  Stark    you  OK?

126
00:07:29,222 --> 00:07:31,554
l'm  sorry to  have
to tell  you  this

127
00:07:33,827 --> 00:07:36,261
Jose  Molina...

128
00:07:36,296 --> 00:07:37,456
was  hit  by a  car...

129
00:07:37,497 --> 00:07:39,055
on  his  way  home
from  school  yesterday

130
00:07:41,401 --> 00:07:43,767
He  died  this  morning

131
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,301
Least  his  parents  got
another  20  bambinos...

132
00:07:49,342 --> 00:07:50,570
running  around
at  home    right?

133
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,168
Go to the  principal's
office    Brian!

134
00:07:52,212 --> 00:07:54,806
That  kind  of talk
is  unacceptable!

135
00:07:59,052 --> 00:08:01,043
What are you
looking  at    Tool?

136
00:08:01,087 --> 00:08:02,019
Hmm

137
00:08:04,991 --> 00:08:08,154
Anyone  who  wants to  see
the  school  counselor－－

138
00:08:11,131 --> 00:08:13,622
Anyone  who  wants to  see
the  school  counselor...

139
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:16,101
there's  a  sign－up  sheet
in  her  office

140
00:08:32,852 --> 00:08:36,845
His  noble  soul
has  climbed  to the  clouds

141
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:40,326
He  was too young
to  leave this  earth

142
00:08:42,662 --> 00:08:46,826
Romeo and Juliet  
Act  3    Scene  one

143
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:35,971
Hey...you  can't  be  in  here

144
00:09:37,817 --> 00:09:39,614
He's  my  uncle

145
00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:46,319
lt's  almost  midnight.
Where  have you  been?

146
00:09:46,359 --> 00:09:47,621
l  went to the  hospital

147
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,025
Are you  all  right?

148
00:09:49,062 --> 00:09:50,290
l'm  fine

149
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,127
l  went to the  lCU

150
00:09:52,165 --> 00:09:55,726
l  saw the  light
on  a  man  there

151
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:57,532
He  was  all  alone.
He  didn't  have  any family...

152
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,936
so  l  sat  next to  his  bed
and  held  his  hand

153
00:09:59,973 --> 00:10:03,101
He  died  an  hour  ago

154
00:10:03,143 --> 00:10:05,270
lt could  be
a  coincidence

155
00:10:05,311 --> 00:10:07,370
Did  you  hear  about Jose?

156
00:10:07,413 --> 00:10:09,643
The  lights
are  not  in  my  head

157
00:10:09,682 --> 00:10:11,650
They're  real

158
00:10:11,684 --> 00:10:14,380
Why  is this  happening?

159
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,684
W－what's  it  mean?

160
00:10:16,723 --> 00:10:18,554
lt just  means that...

161
00:10:18,591 --> 00:10:20,957
you  did  the  right thing
quitting  your job

162
00:10:20,994 --> 00:10:23,827
lt's－－it's just a  sign  that
you  need  a  rest.  That's  all

163
00:10:23,863 --> 00:10:25,797
l  wish  l  could  believe that

164
00:10:27,801 --> 00:10:29,894
How  can  l  help?

165
00:10:29,936 --> 00:10:32,530
Can  you  make  it stop?

166
00:10:54,694 --> 00:10:55,956
Ms.  Stark?

167
00:10:57,263 --> 00:10:58,958
What's  wrong?

168
00:11:07,173 --> 00:11:08,936
Mr.  Carr    l  need
to talk to you

169
00:11:08,975 --> 00:11:10,465
What  is  it?

170
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:13,001
lt's the  students.
They're  in  danger

171
00:11:13,046 --> 00:11:14,843
What  kind  of danger?

172
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:16,246
Did  you  overhear
something?

173
00:11:16,282 --> 00:11:17,749
We  have to  send  them  home

174
00:11:18,985 --> 00:11:21,249
Get them  out of the  building
and  somewhere  safe

175
00:11:21,287 --> 00:11:22,447
Safe from  what?

176
00:11:22,488 --> 00:11:23,978
All  l  know  is...

177
00:11:24,023 --> 00:11:26,355
something  bad
is  going  to  happen

178
00:11:26,392 --> 00:11:27,723
You  protecting  someone?

179
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,886
A  student  maybe?

180
00:11:28,928 --> 00:11:29,986
No.  lt's  nothing  like that

181
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:31,121
What then?

182
00:11:31,164 --> 00:11:33,291
Talk to  me    Rachel

183
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:37,292
Right  before Jose  Molina
was  killed    l  saw...

184
00:11:37,337 --> 00:11:38,964
A  light...

185
00:11:39,005 --> 00:11:40,472
On  his face

186
00:11:40,506 --> 00:11:42,064
A few  hours  later...

187
00:11:42,108 --> 00:11:43,575
he  was  dead

188
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,975
l've  seen  the  same  light
on  2  other  people

189
00:11:45,011 --> 00:11:47,411
They  both  died    too

190
00:11:47,447 --> 00:11:50,974
Today the  light
is  on  the  students

191
00:11:51,017 --> 00:11:54,111
There  were  so  many of them

192
00:11:54,153 --> 00:11:56,485
And  you  think that  means
they're  going  to  die

193
00:11:56,522 --> 00:11:58,046
l  know they are

194
00:11:58,091 --> 00:11:59,649
Ms.  Stark?

195
00:12:02,462 --> 00:12:04,327
l'm  sorry    but...

196
00:12:04,364 --> 00:12:06,730
are you  coming  back
to  class?

197
00:12:12,972 --> 00:12:14,906
Give  us  a  moment

198
00:12:18,278 --> 00:12:20,542
You  have to  believe  me

199
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,674
You  wanted  a  rest.
Clearly    you  need  one

200
00:12:23,716 --> 00:12:24,876
Mr.  Carr!

201
00:12:24,918 --> 00:12:26,385
Tomorrow's your  last day
anyway

202
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:28,944
lt's  probably a  good  thing

203
00:12:38,564 --> 00:12:39,826
He    uh...

204
00:12:39,866 --> 00:12:41,629
he  asked  me to  make  sure
that you  were  OK

205
00:12:41,668 --> 00:12:45,035
And  to    uh    make  sure that
you  left the  building...

206
00:12:45,071 --> 00:12:46,732
before  he  had  security
escort you  out

207
00:12:46,773 --> 00:12:49,640
l  know  what  l  saw

208
00:12:49,676 --> 00:12:52,645
The  lights  aren't a  sign
l  should  quit  my job

209
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:55,204
They're  a  sign
l  need  to  do  my job

210
00:12:55,248 --> 00:12:59,048
Protecting  these  kids－－
that's  our job    right?

211
00:12:59,085 --> 00:13:01,212
Yes    yes    but  protect
them  from  what?

212
00:13:01,254 --> 00:13:02,482
From  who?

213
00:13:02,522 --> 00:13:04,717
l  don't  know  but...

214
00:13:04,757 --> 00:13:06,190
why else...

215
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,058
Why  is this  happening?

216
00:13:10,096 --> 00:13:12,656
Look    Principal  Carr
is  serious

217
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:15,259
He  wants you
off the  grounds

218
00:13:16,602 --> 00:13:19,662
Just go  home    OK?

219
00:13:19,706 --> 00:13:21,731
l  will  keep  an  eye
on  everything  here

220
00:13:21,774 --> 00:13:23,036
l  promise

221
00:13:35,121 --> 00:13:36,281
Ms.  Stark?

222
00:13:38,624 --> 00:13:40,023
Last day    huh?

223
00:13:41,027 --> 00:13:42,824
Apparently

224
00:13:42,862 --> 00:13:44,955
l－－l  heard  about  it...

225
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:48,365
How you  think that
people  are  going  to  die

226
00:13:48,401 --> 00:13:51,632
And  l  was just wondering...

227
00:13:51,671 --> 00:13:53,696
how  many  people  we  were
talking  about?

228
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,870
We're  not talking
about  it at all

229
00:13:59,212 --> 00:14:01,009
Why  not?

230
00:14:02,648 --> 00:14:05,481
ls  it  because you  see
the  light on  my  face?

231
00:14:11,024 --> 00:14:13,117
No

232
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:15,059
l  don't

233
00:14:18,164 --> 00:14:20,132
But you  would  tell  me
if you  did    right?

234
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,566
Uh    because
l'd  want to  know

235
00:14:25,171 --> 00:14:27,503
l'd  tell  you

236
00:14:29,675 --> 00:14:31,165
l  like you    Ms.  Stark

237
00:14:32,178 --> 00:14:34,442
You  know    you're
all  about the truth

238
00:14:36,182 --> 00:14:38,241
l  like you    too    Ben

239
00:14:40,686 --> 00:14:43,177
So  what are you
doing  now?

240
00:14:45,691 --> 00:14:47,318
Go  home    l  guess

241
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,056
Yeah    good－－good  idea.  Um...

242
00:14:50,096 --> 00:14:53,259
it's  better
if you're  not  here

243
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:55,961
Bye    Ms.  Stark

244
00:14:57,437 --> 00:14:59,371
Good－bye    Ben

245
00:15:17,723 --> 00:15:18,883
Kay

246
00:15:21,727 --> 00:15:23,251
l  need  a  favor

247
00:15:23,296 --> 00:15:25,890
Can  you  get  me the  locker
combination  master  list?

248
00:15:25,932 --> 00:15:27,661
You're  kidding    right?

249
00:15:59,232 --> 00:16:00,563
You  leave  me
with  little  choice

250
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,897
Mr.  Carr    it's  Ben

251
00:16:01,934 --> 00:16:03,731
He's  going  to  hurt the  others  
but  l  don't  know  how

252
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:05,236
l  already asked  you
to  leave  once

253
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:06,704
Now  l'm  calling  the  police

254
00:16:08,441 --> 00:16:09,738
Perfect

255
00:16:09,775 --> 00:16:10,833
This  isn't scheduled?

256
00:16:10,877 --> 00:16:11,844
Of course  not

257
00:16:11,878 --> 00:16:13,505
Please    just  listen
to  me    Mr.  Carr!

258
00:16:13,546 --> 00:16:14,570
Let's  go!

259
00:16:14,614 --> 00:16:17,481
Please    if you'd  just
look  in  his journals!

260
00:16:17,517 --> 00:16:19,314
l  don't  know  what's
going  on  here...

261
00:16:19,352 --> 00:16:20,979
but  if  l  find  out
you're  responsible－－

262
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,146
You  have to find  Ben

263
00:16:22,188 --> 00:16:24,281
Keep  moving    people!

264
00:16:24,323 --> 00:16:25,881
Come  on    buddy

265
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,925
Security    help  out    please

266
00:16:28,961 --> 00:16:30,861
Keep  moving

267
00:16:30,897 --> 00:16:32,660
That's  right

268
00:16:48,047 --> 00:16:50,174
Let's  go.  Go.
Move.  Move.  Move

269
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:58,714
Come  on

270
00:16:58,758 --> 00:17:00,521
Let's  go.  Rachel!

271
00:17:21,847 --> 00:17:23,542
Hey    Ms.  Stark

272
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,881
Hi    Ben

273
00:17:25,918 --> 00:17:29,479
You're  not  here to    uh...
give  me the  speech    are you?

274
00:17:29,522 --> 00:17:31,012
What speech?

275
00:17:31,057 --> 00:17:32,024
You  know    how    uh...

276
00:17:32,058 --> 00:17:33,753
Killing  is  wrong    Benjamin

277
00:17:33,793 --> 00:17:35,761
You're  a  smart  kid

278
00:17:35,795 --> 00:17:37,228
l  think you
already  know that

279
00:17:37,263 --> 00:17:38,753
You  hate them
as  much  as  l  do!

280
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:40,425
You  hate  all  of  us.
That's  why you  quit

281
00:17:41,867 --> 00:17:43,334
That's  not true

282
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:44,996
They slashed  your tires

283
00:17:45,037 --> 00:17:47,562
Brian  and  his  little－－
his  little  maggot friends

284
00:17:49,442 --> 00:17:51,433
Stop  right there!

285
00:17:51,477 --> 00:17:53,775
l'm  not going  to  let you
kill  anyone

286
00:17:53,813 --> 00:17:55,303
How you  gonna  stop  me?

287
00:17:57,617 --> 00:17:58,777
Aah!

288
00:18:03,055 --> 00:18:05,216
Run!  Run!

289
00:18:06,225 --> 00:18:07,214
Ben!

290
00:18:08,894 --> 00:18:10,657
Aah!

291
00:18:16,902 --> 00:18:18,335
Rachel!

292
00:18:20,806 --> 00:18:22,671
Oh    God    Rachel

293
00:18:37,156 --> 00:18:39,556
lt－－it's  all  right  now

294
00:18:42,261 --> 00:18:44,456
They're  all  right

295
00:18:44,497 --> 00:18:46,965
Yeah

296
00:18:46,999 --> 00:18:48,933
You  did  good

297
00:18:49,935 --> 00:18:52,233
lt's  OK.
Help's  on  its  way

298
00:18:52,271 --> 00:18:53,795
Don't  leave  me

299
00:18:55,441 --> 00:18:58,569
lt's  so  beautiful

300
00:18:58,611 --> 00:19:00,602
What do you  see?

301
00:19:00,646 --> 00:19:02,705
A  light

302
00:19:14,894 --> 00:19:16,623
Rachel?

303
00:19:18,397 --> 00:19:21,764
Rachel  Stark  didn't ask
to  be  special

304
00:19:21,801 --> 00:19:24,599
She  didn't want
to  be  a  hero

305
00:19:24,637 --> 00:19:27,606
But sometimes fate
reaches  out a  cold  hand...

306
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,335
to tap your  shoulder...

307
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,172
from  the  Twilight Zone
