1
00:00:01,375 --> 00:00:04,139
Javon    l  can't  help  it.
l  have  a  flat tire

2
00:00:04,178 --> 00:00:08,706
Look    listen  to  me    Javon  
you  cannot sign  with  C.S.M

3
00:00:08,749 --> 00:00:10,944
Look    who  got you
thirty  million  for four years?

4
00:00:10,984 --> 00:00:14,750
Yeah    that's  right.  Who  got you
a  six  mil  signing  bonus?

5
00:00:14,788 --> 00:00:16,016
Yeah    that's  right    baby－－me!

6
00:00:16,056 --> 00:00:19,025
No－－l  don't care
what they  promised  you!

7
00:00:20,727 --> 00:00:22,388
They said  what?

8
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:23,418
How  much?

9
00:00:23,463 --> 00:00:26,899
Ohh!  Those  lying  bastards!

10
00:00:26,934 --> 00:00:29,129
Look    Javon    l'm  gonna  be there
in  forty-five  minutes

11
00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:31,262
Don't sign  anything.
You  wait for  me

12
00:00:31,305 --> 00:00:33,296
We're  a  team    right?

13
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,807
Right?

14
00:00:34,842 --> 00:00:35,968
Javon?

15
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:38,273
Damn  it!  Unh!

16
00:00:40,581 --> 00:00:42,344
Ohh!  Damn  it!

17
00:00:45,919 --> 00:00:47,910
Yeah    is this  Tri－state  Towing?

18
00:00:47,955 --> 00:00:50,788
Look    l  got a  flat tire
on  Columbia  Parkway

19
00:00:50,824 --> 00:00:52,451
Between  48th  and  Lagrange!

20
00:00:52,492 --> 00:00:53,891
l  called  you  guys
forty-five  minutes  ago!

21
00:00:53,927 --> 00:00:55,053
Where  are you?

22
00:00:55,095 --> 00:00:56,357
All  right  
you  tell  the  driver...

23
00:00:56,396 --> 00:00:57,829
l  will  give  him
an  extra  fifty  bucks...

24
00:00:57,865 --> 00:00:59,799
lf  he  gets  here  in  ten  minutes

25
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:01,391
No!  Thank you!

26
00:01:02,436 --> 00:01:03,926
Shut  up    already!

27
00:01:05,005 --> 00:01:06,438
This  is  ridiculous!

28
00:01:09,543 --> 00:01:11,340
Meet  Scott Turner...

29
00:01:11,378 --> 00:01:13,107
a  hotshot sports  agent
who thinks  he  knows the  path...

30
00:01:13,146 --> 00:01:15,341
to  success  and  happiness

31
00:01:15,382 --> 00:01:17,873
But  Scott will  discover
that these two things...

32
00:01:17,918 --> 00:01:19,579
don't  necessarily
go  hand  in  hand...

33
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,815
as  he  makes  a  detour
off the  beaten  path...

34
00:01:21,855 --> 00:01:25,347
and  into the  Twilight Zone

93
00:01:35,000 --> 00:02:00,000

35
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,162
Hello?

36
00:02:13,941 --> 00:02:15,806
Hello?

37
00:02:19,346 --> 00:02:21,075
Cell  phones

38
00:02:56,383 --> 00:02:57,611
Hello?

39
00:03:03,223 --> 00:03:04,588
Anybody  home?

40
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,971
A  little  help  here?

41
00:03:27,014 --> 00:03:28,777
Hello!

42
00:03:40,794 --> 00:03:42,386
Excuse  me

43
00:03:43,597 --> 00:03:46,691
Oh    it's  about time

44
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:49,361
Can  you  help  me
get  back  onto the  highway?

45
00:03:49,403 --> 00:03:51,667
l  am  so  lost

46
00:03:52,339 --> 00:03:56,571
You  are traveling
to  another  dimension－－

47
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,046
a  dimension  not only
of sight and  sound...

48
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,571
but of  mind

49
00:04:02,616 --> 00:04:06,177
A journey
into  a  wondrous  land...

50
00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:10,519
whose  boundaries  are  only
that of the  imagination

51
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,526
You  are  entering...

52
00:04:22,202 --> 00:04:24,932
You're  asking  me for  directions?

53
00:04:24,971 --> 00:04:27,303
－Well    don't you  live  here?
－No    l－－

54
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,274
l  just stumbled  onto this  place

55
00:04:29,309 --> 00:04:31,368
l  have  been  wandering
around  the  woods for...

56
00:04:31,411 --> 00:04:33,845
Oh!  That's  perfect

57
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,145
Let  me  guess.
Your  watch  doesn't work

58
00:04:37,184 --> 00:04:41,348
Neither  does  mine.
How  about your  cell?

59
00:04:41,388 --> 00:04:42,855
l  can't get a  signal

60
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:44,948
Neither  can  l  
and  there  are  no  phones  here

61
00:04:44,991 --> 00:04:46,925
Well    it's  a  huge  house.
There's  gotta  be  a  phone

62
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,552
No    believe  me    l  have  looked

63
00:04:48,595 --> 00:04:50,028
Not only  isn't there  a  phone...

64
00:04:50,063 --> 00:04:53,055
there's  no  light switches  
no  clocks...

65
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,499
no  electric  sockets

66
00:04:54,534 --> 00:04:56,399
l'm  a  real  estate  agent.
l  notice these things

67
00:04:56,436 --> 00:04:58,529
－How  about a  car?
－Car?

68
00:04:58,572 --> 00:04:59,800
There's  not even  a  driveway

69
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,832
So  somebody  likes their  privacy

70
00:05:02,876 --> 00:05:05,242
Well...

71
00:05:05,278 --> 00:05:07,838
it's  not as  simple  as that

72
00:05:07,881 --> 00:05:10,076
Come take  a  look  at this.  Um...

73
00:05:10,117 --> 00:05:11,709
Scott Turner

74
00:05:11,751 --> 00:05:14,879
Marisa  Sanborn

75
00:05:14,921 --> 00:05:17,219
How  well  do you  know the  area  
Scott?

76
00:05:17,257 --> 00:05:18,986
Obviously  not very well

77
00:05:19,025 --> 00:05:21,084
l  didn't even  know
there  was  a  forest around  here

78
00:05:21,128 --> 00:05:23,756
This  is  all
supposed  to  be flatland

79
00:05:23,797 --> 00:05:27,062
There  are  no  hills  
let alone  mountains

80
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,431
So  what's that out there?

81
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:32,329
lt's  a  total  mystery

82
00:05:32,372 --> 00:05:34,363
What's that  mean?

83
00:05:35,809 --> 00:05:38,004
This  place  shouldn't  be  here

84
00:05:52,726 --> 00:05:54,455
Hello?

85
00:05:54,494 --> 00:05:56,485
Anybody  here?

86
00:06:15,682 --> 00:06:16,842
l  don't get  it

87
00:06:18,685 --> 00:06:21,449
Somebody's  messin'  with  us

88
00:06:23,757 --> 00:06:24,917
Oh...

89
00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:29,651
Wait a  minute.  Wait a  minute.
l  know  what this  is

90
00:06:31,031 --> 00:06:34,831
This  is  one  of those
silly  reality shows    right?

91
00:06:34,868 --> 00:06:38,099
We're  supposed  to  survive
in  the  wilderness?

92
00:06:38,138 --> 00:06:41,232
l'm  not signin'
any damn  release form!

93
00:06:44,778 --> 00:06:47,975
l  don't think
that's  what this  is  about

94
00:06:48,014 --> 00:06:50,915
So there  l  was  
stuck  in  traffic...

95
00:06:50,951 --> 00:06:52,885
on  the  Columbia  Parkway...

96
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:55,888
in  the  midst of a  horrendous
argument with  my fiancё  Paul

97
00:06:55,922 --> 00:06:58,755
l  just－－
l  couldn't take  it anymore

98
00:06:58,792 --> 00:06:59,918
So you  just got out of the  car?

99
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,394
Well    l  thought
he'd  come  after  me

100
00:07:02,429 --> 00:07:04,021
But  he  didn't

101
00:07:04,064 --> 00:07:07,033
So  l  just  kept walking

102
00:07:07,067 --> 00:07:08,796
There's  supposed  to  be
a  little  park  back  here...

103
00:07:08,835 --> 00:07:10,632
not a  forest

104
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,228
And  l  just wandered  around
until  l  found  this  place...

105
00:07:12,272 --> 00:07:14,240
about an  hour
before you  got  here

106
00:07:14,274 --> 00:07:17,038
All  l  know  is  l  missed
my  meeting  with  Javon  Mercer

107
00:07:17,077 --> 00:07:18,271
The  basketball  player?

108
00:07:18,311 --> 00:07:20,074
He's threatening  to  sign
with  another  agency

109
00:07:20,113 --> 00:07:22,308
He  leaves    l'm  screwed

110
00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:25,250
l'm  juggling  about
a  dozen  real  estate  deals

111
00:07:25,285 --> 00:07:26,650
l've  got  houses  in  escrow...

112
00:07:26,686 --> 00:07:28,916
meetings  with  buyers  
meetings  with  sellers...

113
00:07:28,955 --> 00:07:31,014
all  that    and  l'm  trying
to  plan  my wedding

114
00:07:31,057 --> 00:07:33,548
Stress  is  part of the  game

115
00:07:33,593 --> 00:07:35,720
You  ever feel  like
quitting  the  game?

116
00:07:36,796 --> 00:07:38,161
Not an  option

117
00:07:38,198 --> 00:07:40,132
That's  what  l  always thought

118
00:07:41,534 --> 00:07:43,798
Now  l'm  not so  sure

119
00:07:46,906 --> 00:07:48,498
Scott    come  here!

120
00:07:51,511 --> 00:07:53,103
These  are  all  my size

121
00:07:53,146 --> 00:07:55,546
What are the  chances  of that?

122
00:07:57,284 --> 00:07:58,615
lt's your  size    right?

123
00:07:58,652 --> 00:08:00,483
This  is  gettin'
way too freakin'  weird

124
00:08:56,943 --> 00:08:59,537
You're  gonna  throw
what  in  the fire?

125
00:09:04,317 --> 00:09:05,784
My  past

126
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:14,552
My turn    huh?

127
00:09:14,594 --> 00:09:16,391
When  you're  ready

128
00:09:18,298 --> 00:09:21,461
You  do  know that this  is  crazy

129
00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:25,000
lt's  a  good  kind  of crazy

130
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:28,471
What  if we find  a  way
outta  here?

131
00:09:28,508 --> 00:09:30,999
ls that what you  want?

132
00:10:13,586 --> 00:10:16,180
Help  me!

133
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:20,282
Don't get  me  wrong.
l  love  my  bike

134
00:10:20,326 --> 00:10:22,191
But these  old  motorcycles...

135
00:10:22,228 --> 00:10:23,855
They can  get away from  you  
like that

136
00:10:23,897 --> 00:10:25,888
l  hit this  oil  slick.
The  next thing  l  know...

137
00:10:25,932 --> 00:10:28,196
l'm  sailing  over the  handlebars  
and  l'm  flyin'

138
00:10:28,234 --> 00:10:29,792
Lucky you  weren't  killed

139
00:10:29,836 --> 00:10:32,669
lt's  karma  is  what  it  is.
You  put out good  energy...

140
00:10:32,705 --> 00:10:35,003
the  universe  sends  good  energy
back to you

141
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:39,034
l  must've  been  walking
around  these  woods for  hours

142
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:42,309
l  didn't  know
there  was  a  lake  around  here

143
00:10:43,483 --> 00:10:44,711
－Oh...
－Oh.  Easy  now

144
00:10:44,751 --> 00:10:46,241
Here.  Sit  back

145
00:10:46,286 --> 00:10:47,878
Lay  back.  We  can  talk  later

146
00:10:47,921 --> 00:10:50,913
No  problem.  l'm  Rikki

147
00:10:50,957 --> 00:10:53,152
He's  Scott.  l'm  Marisa

148
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,821
Oh    and  phones
don't work  around  here

149
00:10:56,863 --> 00:10:58,262
Hey    Cole    it's  Rikki

150
00:10:58,298 --> 00:11:00,789
Had  a  little  accident
on  Columbia  Parkway

151
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:02,699
No.  lt's  all  good

152
00:11:02,735 --> 00:11:05,932
Met a  couple  of  nice  people
who  helped  me  out

153
00:11:05,972 --> 00:11:08,873
lf  it's  OK  with  them  
l'm  gonna  spend  the  night

154
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:11,169
Sometime tomorrow

155
00:11:11,211 --> 00:11:14,578
Well    l'm  gonna  hold  you
to that  promise

156
00:11:17,884 --> 00:11:20,614
Did  you  guys  say something
about  phones  not working?

157
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:24,648
l  don't  understand
what you're  so  upset about

158
00:11:24,691 --> 00:11:27,524
No    l'm  not  upset.  l  just don't
know  what she's  doing  here

159
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,858
Well    she  got  lost  in  the  woods
just  like  we  did

160
00:11:29,896 --> 00:11:31,022
So  what  happens  now?

161
00:11:31,064 --> 00:11:32,361
She's just gonna  stay  here
and  live  with  us?

162
00:11:32,398 --> 00:11:33,695
Where  else  is  she  gonna  go?

163
00:11:35,235 --> 00:11:36,668
All  l  know  is...

164
00:11:36,703 --> 00:11:40,400
this  house  is  set  up
for two  people    not for three

165
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,374
OK    what do you  wanna  do?
You  wanna  throw  her  out?

166
00:11:42,408 --> 00:11:44,603
－No.  l'm  not saying  that.
－What are you  saying?

167
00:11:47,914 --> 00:11:50,212
Just don't  use  her  phone    Scott

168
00:11:51,651 --> 00:11:52,777
Why  not?

169
00:11:52,819 --> 00:11:55,879
Because
if we  let the  world  back  in...

170
00:11:55,922 --> 00:11:58,789
then  we  will  lose
everything  we  have  here

171
00:12:04,898 --> 00:12:08,390
No.  l'm  not stoned.
l'm  freakin'  lost

172
00:12:08,434 --> 00:12:10,334
There's  no  way out
of these  woods

173
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,338
Call  the  police  
the fire  department...

174
00:12:12,372 --> 00:12:15,307
the  national  guard    whoever  
and  get  me  out of  here

175
00:12:15,341 --> 00:12:17,866
l  need  your  help    Cole

176
00:12:19,212 --> 00:12:21,339
What's  goin'  on?

177
00:12:21,381 --> 00:12:23,508
Oh    l  got stung  by a  wasp

178
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:26,348
This  is the first time
l've  seen  one  around  here

179
00:12:26,386 --> 00:12:28,013
Oh    you  better
put something  on  that

180
00:12:28,054 --> 00:12:29,783
Yeah

181
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,029
Look    Marisa  
Scott's  not  my type...

182
00:12:37,063 --> 00:12:38,826
if that's  what's  bothering  you

183
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:42,598
l'm  just saying  l've
noticed  a  little  attitude...

184
00:12:42,635 --> 00:12:44,034
and  l  want  us to  be friends

185
00:12:45,471 --> 00:12:46,768
OK

186
00:12:46,806 --> 00:12:49,172
After  all    we're  stuck  out  here
together    right?

187
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,368
Yeah

188
00:12:51,477 --> 00:12:56,505
Poor  Cole.  He's  a  hottie  
but  he's  kinda  lost without  me

189
00:12:56,549 --> 00:12:58,608
l'm  sorry to  hear that

190
00:12:58,651 --> 00:13:01,211
What about you?

191
00:13:01,254 --> 00:13:03,688
lsn't there  someone
you'd  like to  call?

192
00:13:03,723 --> 00:13:06,715
No.  l  don't think  so

193
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:08,192
You're  sure?

194
00:13:08,227 --> 00:13:11,060
No  one's  worrying  about you?
Parents?  Friends?

195
00:13:11,097 --> 00:13:13,065
No.  There's  no  one

196
00:13:13,099 --> 00:13:15,397
l  thought  Scott said
there  was  a  fiancё－－

197
00:13:15,435 --> 00:13:16,561
Paul  something

198
00:13:16,603 --> 00:13:19,163
Scott told  you  that?

199
00:13:19,205 --> 00:13:23,972
－ls  it a  secret?
－Not anymore

200
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,875
You  don't even  want
to  speak to the  guy?

201
00:13:25,912 --> 00:13:27,846
Tell  him  good－bye  at  least?

202
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,507
What's the  number?
l'll  dial  it for you

203
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:30,914
No.  That's  OK

204
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,850
You're  sure?

205
00:13:32,885 --> 00:13:35,217
l'm  gonna  go
take  care  of this  sting

206
00:13:40,526 --> 00:13:43,256
l'll  say one thing－－
l  hate the  quiet

207
00:13:43,296 --> 00:13:45,696
l  hate the  isolation.
l  hate the  boredom

208
00:13:45,732 --> 00:13:47,063
But  l  love the food

209
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,068
Haven't  had  a  bad  meal  yet

210
00:13:49,102 --> 00:13:52,162
No  matter  how  much  we  eat  
there  always  seems to  be  plenty

211
00:13:53,306 --> 00:13:54,933
Let  me  help you  with  those

212
00:13:54,974 --> 00:13:56,771
Don't you  have
better things to  do?

213
00:13:56,809 --> 00:13:59,073
Like  gossip to  Rikki
about  Paul  and  me?

214
00:14:05,418 --> 00:14:08,751
A  scorpion.  Cool

215
00:14:14,193 --> 00:14:15,319
－Hey.
－Oh

216
00:14:15,361 --> 00:14:17,329
lt's  been  three  days
since  l've talked  to  Cole

217
00:14:17,363 --> 00:14:18,830
All  l  get
is  his  answering  machine

218
00:14:18,865 --> 00:14:21,026
l  gotta  get out of  here  
back to  my  life

219
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:22,193
l've  got  my sister's  birthday...

220
00:14:22,235 --> 00:14:23,827
this  party
at Jackie's  and  Rafe's

221
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,838
l  got tickets
to the  basketball  game

222
00:14:25,872 --> 00:14:27,863
-You  like  hoops?
－Are you  kidding?

223
00:14:27,907 --> 00:14:30,808
l  never  miss  a  home  game.
Javon  Mercer  rocks

224
00:14:30,843 --> 00:14:32,071
l  represent  him

225
00:14:32,111 --> 00:14:34,170
－No  way.
-Yeah    way

226
00:14:34,213 --> 00:14:37,444
l'm  a  sports  agent.
He's  my  number  one  client

227
00:14:39,952 --> 00:14:41,419
You  didn't  read  anything
in  the  paper...

228
00:14:41,454 --> 00:14:43,945
about  him  changing
representation    did  you?

229
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,958
l  just  love  watching  him  play

230
00:14:45,992 --> 00:14:48,756
Yeah.  He's  good

231
00:14:51,464 --> 00:14:54,126
lf you're  worried  
why don't you  give  him  a  call?

232
00:14:55,635 --> 00:14:57,102
No.  l  don't think  so

233
00:14:57,136 --> 00:14:59,468
What's the  matter?
Marisa  wouldn't approve?

234
00:14:59,505 --> 00:15:01,370
How  do you  know that?

235
00:15:01,407 --> 00:15:04,865
Listen    l  know  Marisa  is  using
this  place  as  an  excuse...

236
00:15:04,911 --> 00:15:06,572
to  hide from
the  rest of the  world...

237
00:15:06,612 --> 00:15:11,072
but you    you  sound  like you
still  have  a  life  out there

238
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:15,149
l  wonder
who's talking  to Javon  now?

239
00:15:20,093 --> 00:15:22,027
Come  on    Cole    be there for  me

240
00:15:24,297 --> 00:15:25,662
Go    baby!

241
00:15:25,698 --> 00:15:27,666
All  right    your turn

242
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,260
Shoot the  ball!  Shoot  it!

243
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:33,830
Yahoo!  Three－pointer!

244
00:15:33,873 --> 00:15:35,363
Now  play some  "D."

245
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:44,712
No    no    don't  kill  it

246
00:15:56,662 --> 00:15:58,186
lt's  a  big  one    huh?

247
00:16:03,336 --> 00:16:05,327
How  did  a  snake  get  in  here?

248
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:13,636
Are you  sure
you  want to  do this?

249
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:14,839
Are you  gonna  argue  with  me...

250
00:16:14,881 --> 00:16:16,143
or  are you  gonna  let  me
make  a  call?

251
00:16:16,182 --> 00:16:18,412
l  don't want you
to  get  in  trouble  with  Marisa

252
00:16:18,451 --> 00:16:20,476
You  gonna  give  me the  phone
or  not?

253
00:16:22,855 --> 00:16:24,152
Thank you

254
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,023
Javon!
What's  happenin'    man?  Scott

255
00:16:32,031 --> 00:16:33,999
What do you  mean    Scott who?
lt's  me

256
00:16:34,033 --> 00:16:37,161
No.  l  know    l'm  sorry.  l  just...

257
00:16:37,203 --> 00:16:38,568
You  know    l  should've
called  you  sooner...

258
00:16:38,604 --> 00:16:41,732
but  l've  been  out of town
on  business

259
00:16:41,774 --> 00:16:44,368
What do you  mean?
No.  l'm  just checkin'  in...

260
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:46,241
to  see  how
my favorite  client's  doin'

261
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:48,247
You  are  still  my client    right?

262
00:16:51,284 --> 00:16:55,050
－Scott!
-Javon?  Javon?

263
00:16:55,087 --> 00:16:56,247
Javon!

264
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:59,349
l'll  take that  back
if you  don't  mind

265
00:16:59,392 --> 00:17:01,451
What  have you  done?

266
00:17:01,494 --> 00:17:04,088
l  love technology

267
00:17:05,097 --> 00:17:07,759
lt  makes  my job  so  much  easier

268
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,233
What the  hell
are you  talkin'  about?

269
00:17:09,268 --> 00:17:11,634
This  was your  chance
to  be free...

270
00:17:11,671 --> 00:17:13,195
to  live  in  innocence  again

271
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:16,538
All  you  had  to  do  was  accept
what you  were  being  given

272
00:17:16,576 --> 00:17:18,737
But you  mortals  always
want  it all    don't you?

273
00:17:26,652 --> 00:17:29,416
l  think  it's time
you  both  were  leaving

274
00:17:52,545 --> 00:17:54,604
How  many times
have  we  been  through  this?

275
00:17:54,647 --> 00:17:58,811
l  don't  understand  why you  keep
treating  me this  way

276
00:17:58,851 --> 00:18:02,287
l  mean  it    Paul    OK?
l  can't take this  anymore

277
00:18:02,321 --> 00:18:03,982
Look    will  you  relax    Marisa?

278
00:18:04,023 --> 00:18:05,285
l  hate to  interrupt...

279
00:18:05,324 --> 00:18:07,690
but do you  have  a  cell  phone
that  l  could  use?

280
00:18:07,727 --> 00:18:09,388
l  seem  to  have  lost  mine

281
00:18:10,563 --> 00:18:13,828
Yeah.  Paul    where's  my  phone?
l  just  had  it  here  a  minute  ago

282
00:18:13,866 --> 00:18:16,801
How  would  l  know?

283
00:18:18,571 --> 00:18:19,868
l'm  sorry

284
00:18:19,906 --> 00:18:23,433
No.  lt's－－it's  OK

285
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:33,477
Most of  us  dream  of  paradise
at one time  or  another

286
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:35,146
Scott Turner  actually found  his

287
00:18:35,187 --> 00:18:37,621
Unfortunately    he  was  unable
to  hold  onto  it...

288
00:18:37,657 --> 00:18:41,093
and  found  himself
back  in  the  game  of  modern  life
