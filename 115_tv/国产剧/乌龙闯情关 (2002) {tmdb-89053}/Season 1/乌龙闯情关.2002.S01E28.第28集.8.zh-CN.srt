1
00:00:01,428 --> 00:00:04,164
l'm  telling  you    l'm  sitting
across the table...

2
00:00:04,164 --> 00:00:06,032
from  Trevor  Black  
the  casino  owner...

3
00:00:06,032 --> 00:00:07,667
the  guy that  never  loses...

4
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:09,736
and  l'm  just  lookin'
right  into  his  eyes...

5
00:00:09,736 --> 00:00:12,034
and  l  knew that  l  had  him

6
00:00:14,608 --> 00:00:16,543
And  then  l  blinked

7
00:00:16,543 --> 00:00:18,378
l  just  let  him  bluff  me

8
00:00:18,378 --> 00:00:19,640
l'm  out

9
00:00:20,947 --> 00:00:24,317
Hey    just－-just
out of curiosity    huh?

10
00:00:24,317 --> 00:00:27,480
Sure.  Why  not?

11
00:00:30,657 --> 00:00:32,726
You  had  nothing

12
00:00:32,726 --> 00:00:34,828
House  always  wins    Jonah

13
00:00:34,828 --> 00:00:36,463
Honey    it just  never  ends

14
00:00:36,463 --> 00:00:39,266
l  mean    from  champagne
and  fancy dinners  one  week...

15
00:00:39,266 --> 00:00:41,601
to  not  knowing  if we  can
pay the  phone  bill  the  next

16
00:00:41,601 --> 00:00:43,703
Eighteen  months  of this    Jonah

17
00:00:43,703 --> 00:00:46,339
lt's  gotta  end.
You  gotta  just walk  away

18
00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:49,342
No    no    l  can't walk  away.
Not yet.  Listen    April...

19
00:00:49,342 --> 00:00:51,978
The  house  always  wins

20
00:00:51,978 --> 00:00:55,448
l  just  need  to  beat the  house
one time

21
00:00:55,448 --> 00:00:57,984
Once    and  then  l'm  done    OK?

22
00:00:57,984 --> 00:01:01,588
And  then  we'll  escape to  Florida
and  open  the  restaurant    OK?

23
00:01:01,588 --> 00:01:04,958
l'll  learn  how to  braise.
l'll  learn  how to  sautё

24
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:06,983
l  promise you

25
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:09,629
They're  not gonna
hold  that space...

26
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:11,331
in  the  Promenade forever

27
00:01:11,331 --> 00:01:15,135
Baby    l  can  win.  l  just  need
a  little  money...

28
00:01:15,135 --> 00:01:17,203
from  the  restaurant fund
to  get started

29
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:18,371
There's  a  reason...

30
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:20,740
we  decided  to  keep that account
untouchable

31
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,708
April    it's  a  loan

32
00:01:24,177 --> 00:01:27,847
$500
to  be  paid  back  with  interest

33
00:01:27,847 --> 00:01:30,750
Jonah...

34
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,919
my  love...

35
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:35,149
my sweet  boy...

36
00:01:37,924 --> 00:01:39,323
no

37
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:45,432
Jonah  Beach  has  a  problem.
All  of  his  adult  life...

38
00:01:45,432 --> 00:01:46,967
he's  been  trying
to  beat the  house...

39
00:01:46,967 --> 00:01:48,601
and  always  comin'  up  short

40
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:52,205
But Jonah  may  have just found
the  edge  he  needs to  win...

42
00:01:56,943 --> 00:02:00,113
Sir    l  don't suppose
you  could  spare five  bucks...

43
00:02:00,113 --> 00:02:02,048
so  l  could  get  myself a  meal?

44
00:02:02,048 --> 00:02:03,216
Sure  would  appreciate  it

45
00:02:03,216 --> 00:02:04,384
Man    you  hit  me  up
on  the  wrong  night

46
00:02:04,384 --> 00:02:06,353
l  got  $3.00  and  a  bus  pass
to  call  my own

47
00:02:06,353 --> 00:02:08,254
l  wouldn't say  no to  $3.00

48
00:02:08,254 --> 00:02:10,690
Yeah    man  
but  if  l  give you  $3.00...

49
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,225
Tomorrow  l'm  gonna  be
hittin' you  up for two

50
00:02:12,225 --> 00:02:15,695
l'll  make you  a  deal.
You  look  like  a  man...

51
00:02:15,695 --> 00:02:17,797
who  likes to  make  a  wager
once  in  a  while

52
00:02:17,797 --> 00:02:19,532
A  wager?

53
00:02:19,532 --> 00:02:22,035
Three  bucks－－
l'll  flip you  for  it

54
00:02:22,035 --> 00:02:23,570
Dude  
you  just  hit  me  up for five

55
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,038
What do  l  get  if  l  win    huh?

56
00:02:25,038 --> 00:02:26,869
Bragging  rights

57
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:29,709
All  right.  All  right

58
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:31,745
Go  ahead

59
00:02:31,745 --> 00:02:35,448
－Call  it.
－Heads

60
00:02:35,448 --> 00:02:38,118
Oh    sorry    friend

61
00:02:38,118 --> 00:02:41,187
Hey    you  know  what?

62
00:02:41,187 --> 00:02:44,024
Let's  call  it tails.
Go  ahead.  Take  it

63
00:02:44,024 --> 00:02:46,926
You're  a  gambler
and  a  gentleman

64
00:02:46,926 --> 00:02:48,762
For you

65
00:02:48,762 --> 00:02:51,097
Oh    no    no.  Forget  it

66
00:02:51,097 --> 00:02:54,191
No    sir.  Fair trade

67
00:02:55,535 --> 00:02:57,637
Yeah    lucky  me    huh?

68
00:02:57,637 --> 00:02:59,005
Yes    you  are

69
00:02:59,005 --> 00:03:00,140
Whoa!  Whoa!  Wait  up!

70
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,776
Whoa!  Hey!  Wait a  second!

71
00:03:02,776 --> 00:03:03,970
Right over there

72
00:03:05,245 --> 00:03:06,542
l  love you

73
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,956
Testing    one    two    three

Testing    one    two    three

75
00:03:30,503 --> 00:03:31,663
l  know

76
00:03:34,407 --> 00:03:36,042

00:03:58,565 --> 00:04:02,802
You  are traveling
to  another  dimension－－

79
00:04:02,802 --> 00:04:06,139
a  dimension
not only of sight and  sound...

80
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:07,834
but of  mind

81
00:04:09,442 --> 00:04:12,445
A journey
into  a  wondrous  land...

82
00:04:12,445 --> 00:04:17,075
whose  boundaries  are  only
that of the  imagination

83
00:04:19,452 --> 00:04:21,750
You're  entering...

84
00:04:47,881 --> 00:04:49,482
Watch  where you're  going

85
00:04:49,482 --> 00:04:52,178
－Sorry.
-Jerk

86
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:20,613
Five    four    three...

87
00:05:20,613 --> 00:05:22,877
Missed  me

88
00:05:34,861 --> 00:05:38,565
Hey.  Hey    wake  up.  Wake  up

89
00:05:38,565 --> 00:05:41,634
Jonah.
Jonah    where  have you  been?

90
00:05:41,634 --> 00:05:43,303
lt's  2: 30

91
00:05:43,303 --> 00:05:45,371
This.  l've  been  testing  this

92
00:05:45,371 --> 00:05:48,107
－A tape  recorder?
－No    no    no

93
00:05:48,107 --> 00:05:51,044
－This  is  my edge.
－Oh    your  edge

94
00:05:51,044 --> 00:05:53,112
Yeah    you  see    some  guys－－
they  read  tells...

95
00:05:53,112 --> 00:05:56,783
some  guys  count cards  
but  l  have this    OK?

96
00:05:56,783 --> 00:06:00,186
And  there  is  not a  house
in  the  world  that can  beat this

97
00:06:00,186 --> 00:06:01,955
Wait.  No.  Hold  on.
Hold  on  one  second

98
00:06:01,955 --> 00:06:03,855
l  want to  prove this to you.
See the  clock?

99
00:06:04,524 --> 00:06:05,959
Clock  says  2: 31     right?

100
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:09,827
l  say that that clock  is  wrong.
l  say  it's  2: 30

101
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:18,071
Jonah?  Where  have you  been?
lt's－－

102
00:06:18,071 --> 00:06:21,674
Yeah    it's  2: 30.  l  know.
You  see?  See  my edge?

103
00:06:21,674 --> 00:06:25,211
l  can  go  back
up to five  minutes

104
00:06:25,211 --> 00:06:27,513
Up to five  minutes    baby

105
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:30,450
Right.  You're  drunk

106
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,085
What?  You  mean
you  didn't just see that?

107
00:06:32,085 --> 00:06:34,654
See you  jumping  around  my  bed
like  a  raving  lunatic?

108
00:06:34,654 --> 00:06:36,356
Yeah    l  saw that

109
00:06:36,356 --> 00:06:37,687
The－-the－－

110
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:41,752
What's the  deal
with  the tape  recorder    anyway?

111
00:06:44,097 --> 00:06:47,100
This  is...

112
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,202
lt's just for  motivation  
you  know?

113
00:06:49,202 --> 00:06:55,475
To  record  little  affirmations
and  psych  myself  up

114
00:06:55,475 --> 00:06:58,137
Psyched  up for  what?

115
00:07:00,113 --> 00:07:03,981
Oh    no    no.  Jonah

116
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:09,322
No.  No!

117
00:07:09,322 --> 00:07:12,392
April    l  have to  get  back
into the  game    OK?

118
00:07:12,392 --> 00:07:14,794
To  get  back  in  the  game  
l  have to  win...

119
00:07:14,794 --> 00:07:16,696
and  to  win  l  have to  play  
but to  play－－

120
00:07:16,696 --> 00:07:18,357
You  play.  l'm  going  to  sleep

121
00:07:22,035 --> 00:07:24,936
Maybe
l  could  have  said  that  better

122
00:07:27,006 --> 00:07:28,775
Because  l'm  a  winner    baby

123
00:07:28,775 --> 00:07:30,902
And  you  always  gotta
back the  winner

124
00:07:33,613 --> 00:07:35,348
Your  lips    they say  
“No    no    no.”

125
00:07:35,348 --> 00:07:38,181
But your  eyes  say  
“Yes    yes    yes.”

126
00:07:41,788 --> 00:07:45,558
lt's－－it's  my  mom

127
00:07:45,558 --> 00:07:47,960
She...

128
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,064
She  needs  a  colon  transplant

129
00:07:51,064 --> 00:07:54,067
The thing  is    l  have
to  get  back  in  the  game...

130
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:56,934
and  it's  not about the  money

131
00:08:08,514 --> 00:08:11,351
Someday
l'm  gonna  have  a  son    OK?

132
00:08:11,351 --> 00:08:12,852
And  l  want to  be  able
to  look  him  in  the  eye...

133
00:08:12,852 --> 00:08:15,488
and  tell  him
that  l  had  the  nerve...

134
00:08:15,488 --> 00:08:18,391
that  l  stayed  in  the  game  
and  l  beat the  house

135
00:08:18,391 --> 00:08:22,623
l'm  not gonna  give you  $500

136
00:08:26,032 --> 00:08:28,762
But  l  will  give you  two  hundred

137
00:08:30,737 --> 00:08:32,568
You  do  what you  need  to  do

138
00:08:34,407 --> 00:08:36,466
Then  walk  away

139
00:08:46,853 --> 00:08:48,187
What are you  doing  in  there?

140
00:08:48,187 --> 00:08:51,257
Nothing

141
00:08:51,257 --> 00:08:53,088
Just  psyching  myself  up

142
00:09:10,476 --> 00:09:14,180
“  Dream  away  
dream  away    dreamer  ”

143
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,550
“  Fly away    lifetime  screamer  ”

144
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:22,112
“  Satellite  watchin'
for  my  perfect  love  ”

145
00:09:23,756 --> 00:09:28,394
“  Late  at  night  
buzzin' the  street  lights  ”

146
00:09:28,394 --> 00:09:31,731
“  Celebrate
life  in  the firefight ”

147
00:09:31,731 --> 00:09:34,434
“  Every  night  
takin'  all  my  love  ”

148
00:09:34,434 --> 00:09:35,628
Call

156
00:10:04,697 --> 00:10:06,597
Aren't you  interested

l  got a  feeling
my  luck's  gonna  change

167
00:11:25,711 --> 00:11:28,047
You  think  he's  cheating?

168
00:11:28,047 --> 00:11:30,783
That  kid?  He's  got something

169
00:11:30,783 --> 00:11:32,273

Over  on  the  left wing

This  is just the  beginning    OK?

198
00:13:12,351 --> 00:13:16,522
There  is  no telling  how  long

runnin'  on  empty there

224
00:15:57,449 --> 00:16:01,353
What－－what say
we  bend  the  rules  a  little  bit?

225
00:16:01,353 --> 00:16:04,223
Let  me  increase  my stake?

232
00:16:26,145 --> 00:16:29,782
Well    you  know

But you  got what you  wanted.
You  beat the  house

237
00:16:43,462 --> 00:16:45,898
April    honey

238
00:16:45,898 --> 00:16:48,334

that  l  lost  my  nerve...

239
00:16:48,334 --> 00:16:50,736
that  l  just got  lucky

240
00:16:50,736 --> 00:16:52,805
What's  wrong  with  lucky?

241
00:16:52,805 --> 00:16:54,840
You  don't  understand

242
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,577
l  want  him  to  look  me  in
the  eye  and  tell  me  l  beat  him

to  all  this?

246
00:17:06,452 --> 00:17:09,788
l've  been  waiting
for this  moment  my whole  life

247
00:17:09,788 --> 00:17:12,848
l'm  not gonna  let this
get away from  me

248
00:17:18,697 --> 00:17:21,300
You  know  what?

249
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,768
You're  right.  You're  right

00:17:48,727 --> 00:17:50,888
That would  be  accurate

255
00:17:56,568 --> 00:17:58,837
Let's  call  it a  night

256
00:17:58,837 --> 00:18:01,540
That's  it?  You're  done?

You  win  some  
and  you  lose  some    right?

271
00:19:09,475 --> 00:19:13,070
Hey!
That's just a  tape  recorder!

272

You  mean  like this  one?

273
00:19:20,252 --> 00:19:21,787
What?

274
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:24,312
Jonah    the  house  always  wins

275
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:31,794
The  house  always  wins

ln  chasing  the  big  score...

277
00:19:43,409 --> 00:19:46,945
Jonah  Beach  forgot the  one
unchanging  rule  of the  game

278
00:19:46,945 --> 00:19:50,949
The  house  always  wins...

279
00:19:50,949 --> 00:19:54,009
especially  in  the  Twilight Zone
