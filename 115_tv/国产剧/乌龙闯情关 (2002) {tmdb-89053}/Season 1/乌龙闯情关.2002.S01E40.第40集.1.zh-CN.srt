1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,334
Tell  me  again

2
00:00:03,334 --> 00:00:04,368
Again?

3
00:00:04,368 --> 00:00:05,703
Once  more

4
00:00:05,703 --> 00:00:08,372
You  gonna  stare
at that  ring  all  night?

5
00:00:08,372 --> 00:00:09,740
l  love  it

6
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,976
[Whispering]
l  love you

7
00:00:11,976 --> 00:00:13,244
Good  thing  
since  we're  spending

8
00:00:13,244 --> 00:00:15,446
the  rest of our  lives
together  and  all

9
00:00:15,446 --> 00:00:17,615
Tell  me  again
about the  house

10
00:00:17,615 --> 00:00:21,318
l  drove  by  it  last week  
and  it's  still  for  sale

11
00:00:21,318 --> 00:00:23,320
Now    it's  not too  big－－

12
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,288
No

13
00:00:24,288 --> 00:00:25,856
Just enough  room
for you  and  me

14
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:27,658
For  now

15
00:00:27,658 --> 00:00:29,927
And  it's  on  the  edge
of a  cliff

16
00:00:29,927 --> 00:00:31,395
by the  ocean...

17
00:00:31,395 --> 00:00:32,696
so you  can  wake  up
every  morning

18
00:00:32,696 --> 00:00:34,755
and  see the  sun  rise
over the  water

19
00:00:36,267 --> 00:00:37,435
When  can  l  see  it?

20
00:00:37,435 --> 00:00:40,104
Soon.  [Chuckles]

21
00:00:40,104 --> 00:00:42,940
Does  it  have
a  picket fence?

22
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,643
l've  always  wanted  a  house
with  a  white  picket fence

23
00:00:45,643 --> 00:00:46,877
l'll  put one  up

24
00:00:46,877 --> 00:00:49,213
[Laughs]

25
00:00:49,213 --> 00:00:50,510
And  we'll  paint
the  door  red

26
00:00:52,783 --> 00:00:55,820
My grandmother  says
a  bright  red  front door

27
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,788
is  considered  friendly
and  welcoming

28
00:00:57,788 --> 00:00:58,589
You're  cute

29
00:00:58,589 --> 00:01:00,491
Weird    but cute

30
00:01:00,491 --> 00:01:02,393
Alec!

31
00:01:02,393 --> 00:01:04,190
Damn!

32
00:01:06,664 --> 00:01:07,932
l  got distracted

33
00:01:07,932 --> 00:01:09,729
No!

34
00:01:19,844 --> 00:01:21,106
[Groans]

35
00:01:30,588 --> 00:01:32,590
Hi    Sean

36
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,992
Yeah    l  know.  l'm  late

37
00:01:34,992 --> 00:01:36,360
l'll  see you  soon

38
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,395
For  Edie  Durant  
life  as  she  knew  it

39
00:01:38,395 --> 00:01:40,564
ended  over  a  year  ago
on  a  wet country  road

40
00:01:40,564 --> 00:01:43,734
But today she'll  get
a  second  chance  at  happiness...

41
00:01:43,734 --> 00:01:46,370
because  Edie  Durant's future
is  about to  develop

42
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,805
in  a  place  where
the  clearest  picture

43
00:01:47,805 --> 00:01:49,273
isn't always
black  and  white

44
00:01:49,273 --> 00:01:51,742
and  still  life  isn't
quite  so  still...

45
00:01:51,742 --> 00:01:52,576
the  Twilight Zone

46
00:01:52,576 --> 00:01:54,812
Sorry

47
00:01:54,812 --> 00:01:55,980
You  look  a  mess

48
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,648
l  didn't sleep

49
00:01:57,648 --> 00:01:59,016
Nightmares?

50
00:01:59,016 --> 00:02:01,519
The  usual

51
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:02,611
Edie    we  need  to talk

52
00:02:04,555 --> 00:02:05,589
Are you  breaking  up
with  me?

53
00:02:05,589 --> 00:02:06,824
l'm  serious

54
00:02:06,824 --> 00:02:09,994
Good    because  my  life
isn't serious  enough

55
00:02:09,994 --> 00:02:11,962
Too  much  levity  
that's  my  problem

56
00:02:11,962 --> 00:02:14,064
When  is the  last time
you  picked  up  a  camera?

57
00:02:14,064 --> 00:02:16,600
Not since the  accident

58
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,703
You  don't see  any
of our  old  friends  anymore

59
00:02:19,703 --> 00:02:21,839
You  don't work

60
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:24,808
lt's  been  a  year  
and  you're  no  better  off－－

61
00:02:24,808 --> 00:02:26,443
Don't do this to  me    OK?

62
00:02:26,443 --> 00:02:28,707
l  have to

63
00:02:30,981 --> 00:02:32,915
l'm  afraid  for you

64
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,422
l  was  in  a  bad  place

65
00:02:38,422 --> 00:02:40,457
l  won't go  back.  l  promise

66
00:02:40,457 --> 00:02:42,426
Good

67
00:02:42,426 --> 00:02:43,727
So you  don't want
to  go  back there...

68
00:02:43,727 --> 00:02:45,229
and  you  can't stay
where you  are

69
00:02:45,229 --> 00:02:47,965
Your  only option
is to  move forward

70
00:02:47,965 --> 00:02:50,668
What do you  want from  me?

71
00:02:50,668 --> 00:02:55,105
Just go  out and  shoot...

72
00:02:55,105 --> 00:02:58,268
24  pictures  of anything

73
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:06,951
l  don't  know

74
00:03:06,951 --> 00:03:09,818
Edie    Alec  wouldn't
want you  to  live  like this

75
00:03:11,522 --> 00:03:14,252
A year  of  mourning
is  long  enough

76
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,924
OK

77
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:47,985
Hey    baby.  lt's  me

78
00:04:48,619 --> 00:04:50,254
lt's  on  the  edge  of a  cliff

79
00:04:50,254 --> 00:04:51,555
by the  ocean...

80
00:04:51,555 --> 00:04:52,956
so you  can  wake  up
every  morning

81
00:04:52,956 --> 00:04:55,049
and  see the  sun  rise
over the  water

82
00:05:01,432 --> 00:05:03,500
lt's  our  house

83
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,867
Oh    my God

84
00:05:07,938 --> 00:05:09,701
Our  dream  house

85
00:05:12,543 --> 00:05:16,146
You're traveling
to  another  dimension...

86
00:05:16,146 --> 00:05:19,783
a  dimension  not only
of sight and  sound...

87
00:05:19,783 --> 00:05:22,953
but of  mind

88
00:05:22,953 --> 00:05:26,156
A journey
into  a  wondrous  land

89
00:05:26,156 --> 00:05:28,058
whose  boundaries
are  only that

90
00:05:28,058 --> 00:05:30,049
of the  imagination

91
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,954
You're  entering...

92
00:05:50,681 --> 00:05:53,217
Ooh...

93
00:05:53,217 --> 00:05:54,741
these  are  great!

94
00:05:55,786 --> 00:05:57,621
Look

95
00:05:57,621 --> 00:05:59,289
This  is  good

96
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:00,357
Picture  of a  house

97
00:06:00,357 --> 00:06:02,292
Me  and  Alec
used  to  dream  about

98
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:04,762
buying  a  cottage
just  like this

99
00:06:04,762 --> 00:06:06,029
Our  last  night together...

100
00:06:06,029 --> 00:06:08,065
he told  me
that  he'd  found  it...

101
00:06:08,065 --> 00:06:09,099
the  perfect  house...

102
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:10,134
only  he  never  got a  chance

103
00:06:10,134 --> 00:06:10,834
to  show  it to  me

104
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:13,704
OK    and...

105
00:06:13,704 --> 00:06:15,005
l  didn't take this  picture

106
00:06:15,005 --> 00:06:16,974
l  don't even  know
where this  house  is

107
00:06:16,974 --> 00:06:18,575
But when  l  went
to  develop the  pictures

108
00:06:18,575 --> 00:06:19,877
from  the  graveyard  
it was  in  with  them...

109
00:06:19,877 --> 00:06:20,878
right  in  the  middle
of the  roll

110
00:06:20,878 --> 00:06:24,081
Edie    you  haven't  been
in  that darkroom

111
00:06:24,081 --> 00:06:25,416
in  a  year

112
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,785
So  maybe  Alec  took this
picture  of this  house

113
00:06:27,785 --> 00:06:29,820
and  somehow  it got
mixed  in  with  the  stuff

114
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,821
you  shot yesterday

115
00:06:30,821 --> 00:06:32,556
l  checked  the  negative.
lt's  on  there...

116
00:06:32,556 --> 00:06:35,025
but  l  didn't take
this  picture

117
00:06:35,025 --> 00:06:36,260
Sean    it's  in  color

118
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,861
l  only shoot
black  and  white

119
00:06:37,861 --> 00:06:39,530
Well    there's  got to  be
a  logical  explanation

120
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,565
Yeah    it's  a  miracle.
Call  the  Vatican

121
00:06:41,565 --> 00:06:43,867
lt's  not that simple

122
00:06:43,867 --> 00:06:45,169
Hey    Edie

123
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:47,004
Hey    Phil.  Thanks

124
00:06:47,004 --> 00:06:48,005
Do you  mind?

125
00:06:48,005 --> 00:06:49,807
No    go  ahead

126
00:06:49,807 --> 00:06:52,509
At  least consider
the  possibility

127
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:55,779
That what?

128
00:06:55,779 --> 00:06:58,048
That Alec  is trying
to  communicate  with  you?

129
00:06:58,048 --> 00:07:01,251
You  know    Sally Maher
booked  a  show  downtown

130
00:07:01,251 --> 00:07:03,253
She'll  be taking  most
of  her  stuff with  her

131
00:07:03,253 --> 00:07:04,254
Do you  want  her  spot?

132
00:07:04,254 --> 00:07:06,590
You  want  me to  hang
my  pictures  here?

133
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,792
Yeah    bring  in  some framed
prints.  We'll  put them  up

134
00:07:08,792 --> 00:07:09,893
l  don't  know

135
00:07:09,893 --> 00:07:12,129
No    no    she'll  do  it.
She'll  do  it

136
00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:13,730
People  will  see your  work

137
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:16,333
Why can't you  at  least
open  your  mind

138
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,901
to the  idea
that this  is  real?

139
00:07:17,901 --> 00:07:20,003
You're  asking  me
to  believe  something

140
00:07:20,003 --> 00:07:21,605
that  is  impossible

141
00:07:21,605 --> 00:07:22,673
Here  l  thought that was

142
00:07:22,673 --> 00:07:25,209
part of
your job  description

143
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:27,110
Where  are you  going?

144
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,704
Shoot  more  pictures  
see  what develops

145
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:42,359
“  Every time  it  rains  ”

146
00:07:42,359 --> 00:07:44,828
“  l  listen  to the  sky ”

147
00:07:44,828 --> 00:07:48,499
“  l  wonder  what's  so  great
about sunshine  ”

148
00:07:48,499 --> 00:07:50,267
“  So  everybody  lives  ”

149
00:07:50,267 --> 00:07:53,337
“  And  everybody dies  ”

150
00:07:53,337 --> 00:07:58,475
“  And  no  one's  gonna
love you  like  l  do  ”

151
00:07:58,475 --> 00:08:01,011
“  When  l  misunderstand  ”

152
00:08:01,011 --> 00:08:03,347
“  And  then  misunderstood  ”

153
00:08:03,347 --> 00:08:06,817
“  So  love  me  'cause you  can  
and  not  because you  should  ”

154
00:08:06,817 --> 00:08:07,806
You  can  look

155
00:08:09,953 --> 00:08:12,656
“  But every time  it  rains  ”

156
00:08:12,656 --> 00:08:13,645
What's your  name?

157
00:08:16,093 --> 00:08:20,330
“  l  know  it's  good
to  be  alive  ”

158
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,866
“  Every time  it  rains  ”

159
00:08:22,866 --> 00:08:25,602
“  Every time  it  rains  ”

160
00:08:25,602 --> 00:08:33,839
“  l  know  l'm  trying
to  choose  a  life  ”

161
00:08:41,485 --> 00:08:43,320
“  So take  it as  it comes  ”

162
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,056
“  And  take  me  as  l  am  ”

163
00:08:46,056 --> 00:08:50,327
“  l  never  was
a  good  impostor  ”

164
00:08:50,327 --> 00:08:52,829
“  Well    l  know
how to  dream...  ”

165
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:53,797
Those  my  photos?

166
00:08:53,797 --> 00:08:54,798
Take them.  Put them
wherever you  want

167
00:08:54,798 --> 00:08:55,832
l  don't  need
them  anymore

168
00:08:55,832 --> 00:08:57,267
No    no    no    no.
What do you  say

169
00:08:57,267 --> 00:08:59,636
we  make  an  occasion
out of  it?

170
00:08:59,636 --> 00:09:01,705
l'll  invite  some
of the  old  gang

171
00:09:01,705 --> 00:09:04,641
Kay and  Erin
and  Zack  and  Ash?

172
00:09:04,641 --> 00:09:06,165
Whatever you  want

173
00:09:09,846 --> 00:09:12,416
l  called  you
last  night

174
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:13,684
l  was  a  little  worried

175
00:09:13,684 --> 00:09:15,986
l  was  in  the  darkroom.
l  have  something  to  show you

176
00:09:15,986 --> 00:09:18,322
Listen    l  know
that  it was  my  idea

177
00:09:18,322 --> 00:09:20,691
that you  got  back
into taking  pictures...

178
00:09:20,691 --> 00:09:21,692
but  l'm  starting  to think

179
00:09:21,692 --> 00:09:23,057
maybe  it's
a  little too  soon－－

180
00:09:27,497 --> 00:09:29,900
How  did  you  do this?

181
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,834
This  photoshop?

182
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:33,203
lt's  on  the  negative    Sean

183
00:09:33,203 --> 00:09:35,038
Alec  is  doing  this.
He  has to  be

184
00:09:35,038 --> 00:09:36,206
There's  no  other
explanation

185
00:09:36,206 --> 00:09:38,008
Unless you
want  it so  badly

186
00:09:38,008 --> 00:09:39,443
you're  making
it  happen

187
00:09:39,443 --> 00:09:40,911
That's  impossible

188
00:09:40,911 --> 00:09:42,112
Now  who's  being
close－minded?

189
00:09:42,112 --> 00:09:44,014
lt's  him

190
00:09:44,014 --> 00:09:47,050
[Sighs]

191
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:50,520
OK    OK  
say  it  is  him

192
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,289
What do you  think
he's trying  to  say?

193
00:09:52,289 --> 00:09:54,124
He  wants  me
to  be  with  him

194
00:09:54,124 --> 00:09:56,727
Or  maybe  he's
trying  to tell  you

195
00:09:56,727 --> 00:09:57,728
he's  at  peace

196
00:09:57,728 --> 00:09:58,996
Then  he'd  send  me
a  picture  of  him

197
00:09:58,996 --> 00:10:00,588
lying  on  a  beach
in  Bermuda

198
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:04,701
He's  at this  house
waiting  for  me

199
00:10:04,701 --> 00:10:06,536
When  l  find  it  
we  can  be together

200
00:10:06,536 --> 00:10:09,272
OK    OK    OK

201
00:10:09,272 --> 00:10:12,209
Let's  say this  house
does  exist

202
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:15,746
lt could've  been  sold
or torn  down

203
00:10:15,746 --> 00:10:17,314
lt's  out there.
l  know  it

204
00:10:17,314 --> 00:10:18,548
l've  been  searching
the  internet

205
00:10:18,548 --> 00:10:19,916
and  the  classifieds
all  night

206
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:22,986
l  haven't found  it yet  
but  l  will

207
00:10:22,986 --> 00:10:25,079
Why can't you
just  be  happy for  us?

208
00:10:27,591 --> 00:10:30,394
Because there  is
no  "us"  anymore

209
00:10:30,394 --> 00:10:32,663
Alec  is  dead

210
00:10:32,663 --> 00:10:34,665
He  can't come
back to  life

211
00:10:34,665 --> 00:10:36,299
There's  no  way
for you  two

212
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:37,801
to  be together  again

213
00:10:37,801 --> 00:10:38,969
l  mean    really
together  unless you－－

214
00:10:38,969 --> 00:10:39,970
l'll  do  what  l  have to

215
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,461
No    no    no.
You  don't  mean  that

216
00:10:44,908 --> 00:10:46,076
You  promised  me

217
00:10:46,076 --> 00:10:48,578
That was  before

218
00:10:48,578 --> 00:10:51,782
Edie...

219
00:10:51,782 --> 00:10:53,850
Next time  
l  might  not get there

220
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,585
in  time to  save you

221
00:10:55,585 --> 00:10:58,588
l  won't  need  you
to  save  me

222
00:10:58,588 --> 00:11:00,323
l'll  be fine

223
00:11:00,323 --> 00:11:01,381
l'll  be  with  Alec

224
00:11:04,361 --> 00:11:07,097
Chances  are you'll  never
find  that  place

225
00:11:07,097 --> 00:11:07,998
l'll  find  it

226
00:11:07,998 --> 00:11:10,125
Alec'll  show  me

227
00:13:40,851 --> 00:13:42,352
Oh    my God

228
00:13:42,352 --> 00:13:44,320
lt's just  like
we  imagined  it

229
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:57,825
－－Hey.
－－Hey

230
00:13:59,903 --> 00:14:00,904
So    you  ready?

231
00:14:00,904 --> 00:14:01,838
For  what?

232
00:14:01,838 --> 00:14:03,640
The  coffeehouse.
l  left you  a  message

233
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,242
Everyone's  coming
to  see your  pictures

234
00:14:05,242 --> 00:14:06,231
l'm  not going

235
00:14:07,811 --> 00:14:08,812
What?

236
00:14:08,812 --> 00:14:10,347
l  have to  go  back
to the  house

237
00:14:10,347 --> 00:14:11,982
What  house?

238
00:14:11,982 --> 00:14:13,683
l  found  it    Sean

239
00:14:13,683 --> 00:14:15,318
l  found  it.
l  took  pictures

240
00:14:15,318 --> 00:14:16,553
Look

241
00:14:16,553 --> 00:14:18,953
lt even  has  a  nursery

242
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,025
Would  you  listen
to yourself?

243
00:14:22,025 --> 00:14:23,760
lt's there.
lt's  right there

244
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,995
Alec  wants  me to  go there

245
00:14:24,995 --> 00:14:26,826
Alec  doesn't want anything

246
00:14:28,031 --> 00:14:29,633
Alec  is  dead

247
00:14:29,633 --> 00:14:32,669
He's  dead  
and  you're  alive...

248
00:14:32,669 --> 00:14:34,671
and  where  he's  gone  
you  can't follow

249
00:14:34,671 --> 00:14:37,841
You  know    l  thought you  
of all  people    would  have faith

250
00:14:37,841 --> 00:14:39,175
Why do you  want
to  ruin  this for  me?

251
00:14:39,175 --> 00:14:40,944
l'm  not trying
to  ruin  anything

252
00:14:40,944 --> 00:14:42,312
l'm  trying
to  protect you

253
00:14:42,312 --> 00:14:44,147
From  Alec?

254
00:14:44,147 --> 00:14:46,216
From  yourself

255
00:14:46,216 --> 00:14:48,285
Alec  was  my  best friend

256
00:14:48,285 --> 00:14:49,719
l  loved  him
like  a  brother...

257
00:14:49,719 --> 00:14:51,054
and  l  don't  believe

258
00:14:51,054 --> 00:14:52,255
that  he  would  want
you  to  be  with  him

259
00:14:52,255 --> 00:14:53,156
if  it  meant that you  had

260
00:14:53,156 --> 00:14:54,691
to  hurt yourself to  do  it

261
00:14:54,691 --> 00:14:56,192
l  don't want to  hurt  myself

262
00:14:56,192 --> 00:14:59,262
But you  are.
You  are.  Right  now

263
00:14:59,262 --> 00:15:02,198
Edie    this  obsession
is  not  healthy

264
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:04,501
Now    this  isn't
about the  life

265
00:15:04,501 --> 00:15:06,770
that you  shared  with  Alec

266
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,203
This  is  about death

267
00:15:10,006 --> 00:15:11,508
Now  what  l  want
you  to  do?

268
00:15:11,508 --> 00:15:14,511
l  want you...

269
00:15:14,511 --> 00:15:15,912
to  come  down
to the  coffeehouse...

270
00:15:15,912 --> 00:15:17,514
see your friends...

271
00:15:17,514 --> 00:15:22,118
and  spend  one  hour
among  the  living

272
00:15:22,118 --> 00:15:23,107
OK

273
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,579
One  hour

274
00:15:54,617 --> 00:15:55,885
The  pictures
look  great    kid

275
00:15:55,885 --> 00:15:57,654
Let's take
a  closer  look

276
00:15:57,654 --> 00:15:59,554
at the  installation

277
00:16:34,824 --> 00:16:35,859
l  have to  go

278
00:16:35,859 --> 00:16:36,917
－－What?
－－l'm  sorry

279
00:16:38,561 --> 00:16:40,497
He  wants  me to  go there...
right  now

280
00:16:40,497 --> 00:16:42,265
Edie    you're  changing
these  pictures

281
00:16:42,265 --> 00:16:43,833
l'm  not the  one  doing  it

282
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,926
[Sighs]

283
00:16:49,472 --> 00:16:51,274
Edie    wait

284
00:16:51,274 --> 00:16:52,332
l  have to  go to  him

285
00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:00,711
Alec?

286
00:17:04,921 --> 00:17:06,513
Alec?

287
00:17:11,161 --> 00:17:12,890
Please  come  out

288
00:17:22,072 --> 00:17:24,307
l'll  follow you

289
00:17:24,307 --> 00:17:26,207
Just tell  me  how

290
00:17:54,003 --> 00:17:55,905
－－Alec.
－－Whoa    whoa

291
00:17:55,905 --> 00:17:57,340
Easy there

292
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,909
You  OK?

293
00:17:59,909 --> 00:18:03,646
Yeah.  You  just
scared  me    that's  all

294
00:18:03,646 --> 00:18:04,881
Looked  like
you  might fall

295
00:18:04,881 --> 00:18:07,550
Thank you

296
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,551
Well    come  on

297
00:18:08,551 --> 00:18:09,919
Storm's  starting
to  pick  up

298
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,079
Let's  get out
of  here    OK?

299
00:18:12,388 --> 00:18:13,855
Come  on

300
00:18:21,865 --> 00:18:24,200
l'm    uh    Matthew  Forsyth  
by the  way

301
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,202
l  own  the  little  cabin
up there

302
00:18:26,202 --> 00:18:28,037
lt's  a  beautiful  place

303
00:18:28,037 --> 00:18:29,339
Well    it  needs  some  work

304
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:31,074
Actually    it's  been
on  the  market for  over  a  year

305
00:18:31,074 --> 00:18:33,510
My  real－estate  agent told  me

306
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,378
that a  woman  called
yesterday asking  about  it...

307
00:18:35,378 --> 00:18:37,547
so  l  came  out
for  one  last  look

308
00:18:37,547 --> 00:18:39,649
And?

309
00:18:39,649 --> 00:18:40,783
Well    l  don't  know

310
00:18:40,783 --> 00:18:43,419
As  soon  as  l  got  here  
it's  like...

311
00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:44,420
l  had  this feeling

312
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,822
that  maybe  l  shouldn't
sell  after  all

313
00:18:45,822 --> 00:18:48,591
So    l  came  out for
a  walk to  clear  my  heard

314
00:18:48,591 --> 00:18:50,827
Did  it work?

315
00:18:50,827 --> 00:18:53,129
l  think  l'm  going
to  hold  on  to  it

316
00:18:53,129 --> 00:18:54,097
for  a  little  while  longer...

317
00:18:54,097 --> 00:18:56,566
maybe...fix  it  up  a  bit

318
00:18:56,566 --> 00:19:00,303
Yeah    well  
it's  a  great  house

319
00:19:00,303 --> 00:19:02,572
Look    uh    can  l  ask you...

320
00:19:02,572 --> 00:19:05,405
what you're  doing  out  here  
dangling  over  cliffs?

321
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,691
l  was...um...
looking  for  someone

322
00:19:21,691 --> 00:19:24,027
ls  he  here?

323
00:19:24,027 --> 00:19:27,130
No.  No    l  think  he's  gone

324
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,432
l'm  sorry

325
00:19:29,432 --> 00:19:32,402
l  thought  he
brought  me  out  here

326
00:19:32,402 --> 00:19:33,503
so  we  could  be together

327
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,939
But  he  didn't?

328
00:19:35,939 --> 00:19:39,742
No

329
00:19:39,742 --> 00:19:42,006
Maybe  he  wanted
to  say good－bye

330
00:19:45,215 --> 00:19:46,249
l  have to  go

331
00:19:46,249 --> 00:19:47,550
l've  got to  get
back  into town

332
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,118
Um...look  
l  hope  l'm  not

333
00:19:49,118 --> 00:19:51,387
being  too forward  
but you...

334
00:19:51,387 --> 00:19:53,856
you  seem  a  little  lost

335
00:19:53,856 --> 00:19:54,691
ls there  anything  l  can  do?

336
00:19:54,691 --> 00:19:58,595
Yeah.  Yeah  
fix the  house  up

337
00:19:58,595 --> 00:20:00,663
Put a  picket fence
around  it

338
00:20:00,663 --> 00:20:01,898
OK    l'll  do that

339
00:20:01,898 --> 00:20:05,026
Um    maybe  l'll  paint
the  door  red

340
00:20:08,238 --> 00:20:09,205
What did  you  say?

341
00:20:09,205 --> 00:20:12,141
Oh    l  just－－
l  know  it sounds  weird

342
00:20:12,141 --> 00:20:15,445
l  just－－l  heard  somewhere
that a  bright  red  front door

343
00:20:15,445 --> 00:20:17,640
is  considered  friendly
and  welcoming

344
00:20:19,315 --> 00:20:23,253
Yeah.
l－－l've  heard  that    too

345
00:20:23,253 --> 00:20:25,188
Uh...

346
00:20:25,188 --> 00:20:27,857
You  know    l  think
the  stove  still  works

347
00:20:27,857 --> 00:20:29,726
Um...

348
00:20:29,726 --> 00:20:32,661
You  want a...
cup  of tea  or  something?

349
00:20:34,864 --> 00:20:36,966
Yeah

350
00:20:36,966 --> 00:20:38,368
That'd  be  nice

351
00:20:38,368 --> 00:20:39,960
OK

352
00:20:41,437 --> 00:20:43,906
Edie  Durant thought
her  life  was  over...

353
00:20:43,906 --> 00:20:47,043
but a  lost  love  gave  her
a  new  path  to follow

354
00:20:47,043 --> 00:20:49,345
Now    Edie  is taking
her first step

355
00:20:49,345 --> 00:20:50,947
back  into the  world...

356
00:20:50,947 --> 00:20:53,507
and  out of
the  Twilight Zone
