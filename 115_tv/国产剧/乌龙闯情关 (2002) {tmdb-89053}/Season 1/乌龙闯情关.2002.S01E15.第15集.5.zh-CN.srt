2
00:00:06,956 --> 00:00:07,957
Hey    you  grab
dinner yet?

3
00:00:07,957 --> 00:00:09,125
No

4
00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:10,727
Let's  swing  by  Luigi's

5
00:00:10,727 --> 00:00:12,228
Didn't you  hear?  The
old  man  shut the  doors

6
00:00:12,228 --> 00:00:13,563
He  moved  to  Tampa

7
00:00:13,563 --> 00:00:14,631
Oh    damn

8
00:00:14,631 --> 00:00:17,067
Best  pizza
in  the  neighborhood

9
00:00:17,067 --> 00:00:19,228
Luigi's  was
an  institution

10
00:00:21,905 --> 00:00:24,007
Well    l  figured  he  should
get out of the  'hood…

11
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:25,008
while  he  was  still  alive

12
00:00:25,008 --> 00:00:27,610
Which  is  more
than  l  can  say for you

13
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,746
Hey    these
are  my streets

14
00:00:29,746 --> 00:00:32,048
Somebody's  gotta
watch  over  'em

15
00:00:32,048 --> 00:00:33,583
Unit  1 2    we  have  a  927－－

16
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,852
Denver  on  Carlton
and  Third

17
00:00:35,852 --> 00:00:37,954
Suspicious  circumstances  
woman  screaming

18
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:40,223
We're  on  it

19
00:00:40,223 --> 00:00:41,850
Just another  day
at the  office

20
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,362
You  stupid  ho

21
00:00:46,362 --> 00:00:48,932
You  think you  could
up  and  leave  me?

22
00:00:48,932 --> 00:00:50,900
Huh?

23
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,494
You  think  l'd  just  let
you  walk  away from  me?

24
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,741
Look  at you!

25
00:01:02,746 --> 00:01:04,781
Oh    yeah

26
00:01:04,781 --> 00:01:07,350
But you  take  what  l  give you  
and  you  throw  it away

27
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,886
Now    how  does that
make  me feel?

28
00:01:09,886 --> 00:01:13,957
Some  dumb－ass  runaway…
And  l  took you…

29
00:01:13,957 --> 00:01:18,328
molded  you  
made you  into  a  goddess

30
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,353
And  you  throw  it
all  away to  become  what?

31
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,666
Nothing

32
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:28,671
'Cause that's  all
you  are  right  now…nothing

33
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:31,107
Rigo    Rigo    please

34
00:01:31,107 --> 00:01:32,108
Please  what?

35
00:01:32,108 --> 00:01:34,711
Don't  hurt  me

36
00:01:34,711 --> 00:01:37,914
You  betray  my  love  
try to  deny  my  power

37
00:01:37,914 --> 00:01:39,616
No    l  didn't－－

38
00:01:39,616 --> 00:01:41,518
You  disrespected  me!

39
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,386
And  now…

40
00:01:43,386 --> 00:01:45,255
lt's time to  pay

41
00:01:45,255 --> 00:01:47,357
No    no!

42
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,416
Drop the  knife!

43
00:01:51,127 --> 00:01:52,562
Well    well  
what  have  we  here?

44
00:01:52,562 --> 00:01:54,898
l  said  put
the  knife  down  now！

45
00:01:54,898 --> 00:01:58,067
Ha  ha  ha.  Will  you
look  at  him  shine?

46
00:01:58,067 --> 00:02:00,737
That's the  light
gleamin'  off  his  armor

47
00:02:00,737 --> 00:02:02,839
Looks  like your  very
own  Sir  Galahad's…

48
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:04,808
come to  rescue your
sorry  little  ass

49
00:02:04,808 --> 00:02:06,442
This  is your
last warning

50
00:02:06,442 --> 00:02:07,443
You  heard  him

51
00:02:07,443 --> 00:02:10,013
No  need  for  anyone
to  get  hurt

52
00:02:10,013 --> 00:02:11,648
Hurt?

53
00:02:11,648 --> 00:02:13,616
You  can't  hurt  me

54
00:02:13,616 --> 00:02:15,585
Tell  him  why

55
00:02:15,585 --> 00:02:17,654
Please…

56
00:02:17,654 --> 00:02:20,423
Because  l  am  the
power  and  the  glory…

57
00:02:20,423 --> 00:02:23,827
the  darkness
and  the  light

58
00:02:23,827 --> 00:02:26,563
Judge    jury…

59
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:29,332
and  executioner

60
00:02:29,332 --> 00:02:30,924
－Aah!  Aah!
-Yaah!

61
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:34,725
No!

62
00:02:37,307 --> 00:02:40,143
This  is  unit  1 2…
Shots fired

63
00:02:40,143 --> 00:02:41,978
Suspect down

64
00:02:41,978 --> 00:02:43,502
Request  back－up  
ambulance…

65
00:02:44,614 --> 00:02:49,381
Repeat:  Suspect down  
Third  and  Carlton

66
00:03:04,534 --> 00:03:06,236
Hey

67
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:07,770
You  OK?

68
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,540
Yeah.  Why wouldn't  l  be?

69
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,376
Just another  scumbag
off the  streets

70
00:03:13,376 --> 00:03:16,713
Hey    Dirty  Harry  
you  just took  a  life

71
00:03:16,713 --> 00:03:18,815
Stop  pretending  it doesn't
make your  guts turn

72
00:03:18,815 --> 00:03:21,384
Nah    l'm  not  pretending
anything    Angie.  l  mean…

73
00:03:21,384 --> 00:03:22,942
l'm  just doin'  my job

74
00:03:25,922 --> 00:03:26,911
OK

75
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,830
Hello?

76
00:03:38,268 --> 00:03:40,103
Hello?

77
00:03:40,103 --> 00:03:42,196
Nice  shootin'    Galahad

78
00:03:43,706 --> 00:03:45,775
Who  is this?

79
00:03:45,775 --> 00:03:48,972
Oh    you're  lookin'  at  me

80
00:03:51,514 --> 00:03:54,150
You  didn't think  it'd  be
that easy    did  you?

81
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,754
Hello.  Hello?!

82
00:03:57,754 --> 00:03:59,881
lt's  not over

83
00:04:01,624 --> 00:04:03,760
Eric  Boggs    policeman

84
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,895
These  are  his  streets  
his  people

85
00:04:05,895 --> 00:04:08,831
He  sees  himself
as their  guardian  angel…

86
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,167
but  Eric's  sense  of duty
and  his  sanity…

87
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:14,203
are  about to  be tested  by
a  most  uncommon  criminal…

88
00:04:14,203 --> 00:04:16,637
in  the  Twilight Zone

89
00:04:17,307 --> 00:04:21,444
You're traveling
to  another  dimension…

90
00:04:21,444 --> 00:04:25,081
a  dimension  not only
of sight and  sound…

91
00:04:25,081 --> 00:04:28,251
but of  mind…

92
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:31,254
A journey
into  a  wondrous  land…

93
00:04:31,254 --> 00:04:35,315
whose  boundaries  are  only
that of the  imagination

94
00:04:38,761 --> 00:04:44,023
You're  entering…

95
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,589
You  sure you  don't
want  us to take you  home?

96
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,250
You're  lookin'  at  it

97
00:05:13,796 --> 00:05:15,431
You  gonna  be  OK?

98
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:17,133
Yeah.  Don't worry
about  me

99
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:18,896
Anything's  better
than  working  for  Rigo

100
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,765
Take  care    Galahad

101
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,746
1 7  going  on  40

102
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,647
Feel  like
getting  caffeinated?

103
00:05:31,647 --> 00:05:33,016
Yeah.  Gimme  a  minute

104
00:05:33,016 --> 00:05:36,085
All  right

105
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,916
Hey    Carla

106
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:41,791
Look    um    officer－－

107
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,626
l  just  have
one  question

108
00:05:43,626 --> 00:05:45,328
Was there  anyone  else  in
the  alley with  you  and  Rigo?

109
00:05:45,328 --> 00:05:47,764
Like  who?

110
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,499
One  of  Rigo's
posse  members    maybe

111
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:52,201
Rigo  had  no  posse

112
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:54,971
He  didn't trust  his  ladies

113
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:56,131
He  didn't trust  nobody

114
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,808
Why are you  asking?

115
00:05:58,808 --> 00:06:00,109
Never  mind

116
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,645
Just a  prank  call    l  guess

117
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:05,944
You  don't…
remember  me    do you?

118
00:06:07,383 --> 00:06:09,285
l'm  Hector  Arroyo's  sister

119
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,276
Damn.  l  thought
it was you

120
00:06:12,989 --> 00:06:15,491
You  know  Hector's
in  San  Quentin?

121
00:06:15,491 --> 00:06:16,826
Yeah    l  heard

122
00:06:16,826 --> 00:06:18,851
lt doesn't  have to  be
that way    though    you  know?

123
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:26,702
Look    um    don't  let
that  Sir  Galahad  thing…

124
00:06:26,702 --> 00:06:28,071
go to your  head

125
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:30,673
l  don't  need
any  more  rescuing

126
00:06:30,673 --> 00:06:33,142
Hey    it doesn't  hurt to  have
someone  lookin'  out for you

127
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,912
lf  l  didn't  have  my  uncle  
l'd  probably  be  in  the  cell…

128
00:06:35,912 --> 00:06:37,436
right  next to your
brother  Hector

129
00:06:39,515 --> 00:06:41,608
Well    l  don't
have  no  uncle

130
00:06:43,753 --> 00:06:45,914
lf you  need  to talk

131
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:51,458
You  be  safe  out  here    OK?

132
00:07:08,711 --> 00:07:10,872
l  said  put
the  knife  down  now！

133
00:07:13,483 --> 00:07:15,713
This  is your  last warning

134
00:07:18,387 --> 00:07:19,479
Yaah!

135
00:07:35,805 --> 00:07:37,739
This  is  Boggs

136
00:07:38,774 --> 00:07:39,763
Hello?

137
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:44,213
Hello?

138
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,648
Good－bye

139
00:07:45,648 --> 00:07:47,616
What's  up    Galahad?

140
00:07:49,285 --> 00:07:51,454
The  ho  was  mine

141
00:07:51,454 --> 00:07:52,655
Who the  hell  are you?

142
00:07:52,655 --> 00:07:55,391
She's  a  keeper

143
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,793
A  real  money－machine

144
00:07:57,793 --> 00:07:58,995
Whoever this  is－－

145
00:07:58,995 --> 00:08:00,163
She's  mine!

146
00:08:00,163 --> 00:08:03,360
And  this time  l'm  gonna
finish  what  l  started!

147
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,681
This the  guy?

148
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:22,318
Officer?  You  with  me?

149
00:08:22,318 --> 00:08:25,521
lt's  him.
Rodrigo  Valentine

150
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:28,490
l  just  keep  expectin'
him  to  sit  up

151
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:32,920
8 years  on  the job  
hasn't  happened  yet

152
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:37,232
l'll  be  right  back

153
00:08:47,343 --> 00:08:49,345
What are you  doin'  here?

154
00:08:49,345 --> 00:08:51,581
Johnson  told  me
where you  were

155
00:08:51,581 --> 00:08:54,050
So    the  real  question  ls
what are  we  doin'  here?

156
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,118
l  was just checkin'
somethin'  out

157
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:59,222
Go  on.  This  should
be  interesting

158
00:08:59,222 --> 00:09:00,523
OK

159
00:09:00,523 --> 00:09:03,059
You're  never  gonna  believe
who's  been  callin'  me  up

160
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:04,493
The  hooker?

161
00:09:04,493 --> 00:09:05,795
No    her  pimp

162
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:06,829
How  many  pimps
that girl  have?

163
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:09,165
Well    as far  as  l  know  
she  only  had  one

164
00:09:09,165 --> 00:09:10,166
You  mean  this  guy…

165
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,235
this  guy  right  here…

166
00:09:12,235 --> 00:09:14,537
the  one  with  the  gaping  hole
in  his  chest?

167
00:09:14,537 --> 00:09:15,771
l  know
it sounds  crazy…

168
00:09:15,771 --> 00:09:17,840
but－－but  he  said  he  was
comin'  back for  Carla

169
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,710
Oh    man    that doesn't sound
crazy.  That  is  crazy

170
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,812
Well    Johnson's
tracin' the  calls…

171
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,514
but  l'm  tellin' you
l  know  what  l  heard

172
00:09:25,514 --> 00:09:28,217
Look    Boggs    takin'  a  life
is  a  big  deal

173
00:09:28,217 --> 00:09:30,486
lt will  eat away at you
until  you  talk to  someone

174
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:31,787
You  think this
is  all  in  my  head?

175
00:09:31,787 --> 00:09:32,922
l've  seen  this  crap  before

176
00:09:32,922 --> 00:09:34,724
You're feelin'  guilty
for  killin' this  creep…

177
00:09:34,724 --> 00:09:35,725
and  this  is
your  subconscious…

178
00:09:35,725 --> 00:09:37,093
tryin' to find  a  way
to  deal  with  it

179
00:09:37,093 --> 00:09:38,261
Nah    l  checked
this  guy's files

180
00:09:38,261 --> 00:09:41,163
This  man  was  into  all
sorts  of twisted  stuff－－

181
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:43,899
satanic  rituals  
the  black  arts

182
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:45,167
Doesn't  make  him
any  less  dead

183
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:48,571
You're  right.
You're  absolutely  right

184
00:09:48,571 --> 00:09:50,339
Except for  one thing

185
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,407
And  what's that?

186
00:09:51,407 --> 00:09:52,704
My  phone
won't stop  ringin'

187
00:09:58,514 --> 00:09:59,503
Gimme that

188
00:10:01,817 --> 00:10:03,252
Hello?

189
00:10:03,252 --> 00:10:05,755
Hello?!

190
00:10:05,755 --> 00:10:07,223
There's  nobody there

191
00:10:07,223 --> 00:10:09,492
This  is  Boggs

192
00:10:09,492 --> 00:10:11,084
l'm  comin'
for  her tonight…

193
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:15,631
Gonna  cut  her  ear to  ear…

194
00:10:15,631 --> 00:10:18,794
And  there  ain't a  thing
you  can  do  about  it

195
00:10:20,603 --> 00:10:21,704
Hello?

196
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,262
ls  anyone there?

197
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,912
This  is  all  in  your  head.
You  know that    don't you?

198
00:10:29,912 --> 00:10:32,715
l  want you
to  promise  me…

199
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,149
you're  gonna  talk
to  somebody.  Soon

200
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,695
What  is  she  
your  girlfriend  now?

201
00:10:45,695 --> 00:10:48,095
l  have to talk
to  her    Angie

202
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,901
Carla    we  have to talk

203
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:55,137
Yeah    well    it's  gonna
cost you  1 00  bucks

204
00:10:55,137 --> 00:10:56,539
Listen  to  me…

205
00:10:56,539 --> 00:10:58,441
You  need  to  get outta  here.
Out of the  city

206
00:10:58,441 --> 00:10:59,909
What for?

207
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,244
l  think you're  in  danger

208
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:03,512
What  kind  of danger?

209
00:11:03,512 --> 00:11:04,847
Your  life's
been  threatened

210
00:11:04,847 --> 00:11:05,915
lf you're tryin' to  get
me to  quit the  life－－

211
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,550
Look    l'm  tryin'
to  protect you

212
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:11,120
Well    l  don't  need
your  protection    Eric

213
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,589
What  l  need
is to  pay  my  rent

214
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,424
Come to  my  place
tonight    OK?

215
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:16,926
ls that what
this  is  about?

216
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,828
You－-you  tryin' to  get
yourself some free tail?

217
00:11:18,828 --> 00:11:20,062
Carla    listen  to  me－－

218
00:11:20,062 --> 00:11:21,430
you're  not saying  anything
worth  listenin' to

219
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,132
Carla    please…

220
00:11:23,132 --> 00:11:24,800
Carla!

221
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,598
Can  you  blame  her?

222
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,376
Let's just circle
the  block  a  few times

223
00:11:33,376 --> 00:11:34,577
Why?!

224
00:11:34,577 --> 00:11:35,945
l  have to  keep
an  eye  on  her

225
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,179
Eric    l  did
some  checking

226
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:39,148
Rigo's  body was  sent to
a  crematorium  yesterday

227
00:11:39,148 --> 00:11:41,283
He  nothin'  but a  pile
of ashes  by  now

228
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:42,585
What    are you  gonna  worry
about a  pile  of ashes?

229
00:11:42,585 --> 00:11:43,786
l  don't  know!

230
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,388
l  don't  know
what to think    OK?

231
00:11:45,388 --> 00:11:47,618
Well    l  do.  We  need
to  get  back to  work

232
00:11:59,702 --> 00:12:01,370
Hi.  l'm  not  in.
Leave  a  message…

233
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,672
after the tone    and
l'll  get  right  back to you

234
00:12:03,672 --> 00:12:06,976
Hey    Boggs    it's  Angela.
l  need  to talk to you…

235
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,375
about Carla  Arroyo

236
00:12:09,678 --> 00:12:10,780
Yeah    l'm  here

237
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,081
l  just got the  call

238
00:12:12,081 --> 00:12:14,583
l  don't  know  how
to tell  you  this    but…

239
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:17,186
But what?
What's  wrong?

240
00:12:17,186 --> 00:12:20,212
lt's  Carla.  She's  dead

241
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:30,199
They're  still  combin' the
area  for the  murder  weapon

242
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:32,601
They won't find  one

243
00:12:32,601 --> 00:12:35,070
Boggs    Rigo  had
nothin' to  do  with  this

244
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,071
Just  like
he  said  he  would

245
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:37,406
No    he  didn't

246
00:12:37,406 --> 00:12:39,742
This  was  a  pissed－off john
or  some  crack－head

247
00:12:39,742 --> 00:12:42,344
Look    he  laid  it out.  He
said  he  was  gonna  come

248
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,712
Eric    listen  to  me

249
00:12:43,712 --> 00:12:46,215
l've  been  listenin'
to you    Angie

250
00:12:46,215 --> 00:12:47,516
And  what did  it get  me  
huh?  She's  dead

251
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,151
That's  right…

252
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:51,353
But you  know  what?  She
wasn't  killed  by some  ghost

253
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,456
There  was  nothin'  supernatural
about this    Eric

254
00:12:53,456 --> 00:12:55,124
That's  easy
for you  to  say

255
00:12:55,124 --> 00:12:57,092
You're  not the  one
gettin' the  calls

256
00:12:57,092 --> 00:12:58,661
Look    this  girl
was  in  danger…

257
00:12:58,661 --> 00:13:01,096
every single time  she
stepped  out onto the  street

258
00:13:01,096 --> 00:13:04,099
What were you  gonna  do  
Eric    watch  over  her  24－7?

259
00:13:04,099 --> 00:13:05,225
That's  not your job

260
00:13:06,402 --> 00:13:09,394
Look    Eric    go  home.
Get some  rest

261
00:13:32,595 --> 00:13:35,364
“  My way of  lovin' you
is  like  bullets  in  the  rain  ”

262
00:13:35,364 --> 00:13:37,733
“  Ain't a  single  place to  hide  
l'll  always  see you  again  ”

263
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,736
“ You  should  really stop
denyin' yourself ”

264
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,137
“  Of the  sweeter things
in  life  ”

265
00:13:42,137 --> 00:13:43,806
“  That can't  be  bought
with  broken  words  ”

266
00:13:43,806 --> 00:13:46,141
“  Priceless  gifts…  ”

267
00:13:46,141 --> 00:13:47,810
You're that cop    right?

268
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:50,904
The  one  who  saved  her
from  Rigo?

269
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,219
l  guess  all  you  did…

270
00:13:57,219 --> 00:13:58,988
was just  buy  her
a  little  bit  more time

271
00:13:58,988 --> 00:14:01,991
“  l  feel  like  l'm  hangin'
in  the  coldest  breeze  ”

272
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:04,493
“  At the  whim  of your  emotion  
l'm  apt to  please  ”

273
00:14:04,493 --> 00:14:07,062
“  Here  come the  queen  of  pain
with  the  ice－dusted  throne  ”

274
00:14:07,062 --> 00:14:09,598
“  The  breeze  will  sting
and  a  passion  l  own  ”

275
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,901
“  365  will  equal  360  ”

276
00:14:11,901 --> 00:14:14,703
“  l  hope you  know    'cause  
'cause    'cause  ”

277
00:14:14,703 --> 00:14:17,439
“ You  ”

278
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:20,009
“  And  me  ”

279
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:22,778
“  Were  meant to  be  ”

280
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:25,314
“  Destiny ”

281
00:14:25,314 --> 00:14:27,383
“  True  ”

282
00:14:27,383 --> 00:14:30,486
“  Complete  ”

283
00:14:30,486 --> 00:14:33,022
“ You  and  me  ”

284
00:14:33,022 --> 00:14:35,650
“  Destiny ”

285
00:15:19,234 --> 00:15:22,761
What do you  want  
you  son  of a  bitch?

286
00:15:24,406 --> 00:15:25,896
Who's there?!

287
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,735
l'm  scared

288
00:15:30,946 --> 00:15:33,048
lt's  so  dark

289
00:15:33,048 --> 00:15:34,883
Carla?

290
00:15:34,883 --> 00:15:36,552
Oh    God.  Here  he  comes!

291
00:15:36,552 --> 00:15:37,553
What?!

292
00:15:37,553 --> 00:15:39,121
He's  here!

293
00:15:39,121 --> 00:15:40,422
Where  are you?!

294
00:15:40,422 --> 00:15:42,257
Help  me    please    help  me!

295
00:15:42,257 --> 00:15:43,492
Help  how?!

No!

302
00:16:04,346 --> 00:16:05,914
Eric?

303
00:16:05,914 --> 00:16:08,584

308
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,616

315
00:17:26,729 --> 00:17:27,863

317
00:17:29,531 --> 00:17:31,767
You  did?

00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:33,035
Those  calls?

319
00:17:33,035 --> 00:17:34,136
They've  all  been  comin'
from  a  pay  phone…

320
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,071
in  the  alley where
you  killed  that  pimp

321
00:17:36,071 --> 00:17:37,539
And  you  know
what's  weird?

322
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:40,409
That  phone's  been  outta
service for  months

323
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:42,144
Yeah.  Th-thanks    Johnson

00:18:20,449 --> 00:18:23,085
Where  are you?

327
00:18:23,085 --> 00:18:25,788
Where  are you    Rigo?

328
00:18:25,788 --> 00:18:27,278
Rigo!

329
00:18:28,724 --> 00:18:31,284
Right  behind  you  
Galahad

330
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:47,072
Here  l  am    Galahad

331
00:18:49,645 --> 00:18:52,247
And  here  l  am    Rigo

00:18:52,247 --> 00:18:53,248
Tell  him    ho

333
00:18:53,248 --> 00:18:55,546
Tell  him  who  owns you

334
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,409
Rigo

335
00:19:00,422 --> 00:19:01,857
Hear that?

336
00:19:01,857 --> 00:19:03,258
She  knows

337
00:19:03,258 --> 00:19:05,360
This fool  owns  no  one

338
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,064
He's just a  two－bit  pimp  
a  nothing

339
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,632
Just a  little  bit closer

340
00:19:10,632 --> 00:19:13,001
l  saved  you  once…

341
00:19:13,001 --> 00:19:15,637
And  l  can  do  it again

342
00:19:15,637 --> 00:19:17,906
Come  on

343
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,396
l'm  waitin' for ya

344
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:21,833
Aah!

345
00:19:33,021 --> 00:19:35,251
l  should've  never
left you  alone

346
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:39,954
lt's  a  real  shame    huh?

347
00:19:41,797 --> 00:19:43,332
What do you  got?

348
00:19:43,332 --> 00:19:44,533
Well    it  looks  like…

349
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:46,668
he  was  shot with  his  own
weapon    close  range

350
00:19:46,668 --> 00:19:48,570
l'm  gonna  run
the  gun  for  prints…

351
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,138
but judging  from
the  angle  of entry…

352
00:19:50,138 --> 00:19:54,109
and  the  powder  residue  
it  looks  like  suicide

353
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,778
He  was  in  a  really
bad  place…

354
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:59,715
but  l  never thought that  he－－

355
00:19:59,715 --> 00:20:01,774
A  real  shame

356
00:20:10,492 --> 00:20:12,050
Hello

357
00:20:13,095 --> 00:20:14,426
Angela

358
00:20:16,832 --> 00:20:18,166
Eric?

359
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,935
Everything's  OK

360
00:20:19,935 --> 00:20:22,871
Carla's  safe  now

361
00:20:22,871 --> 00:20:24,532
l'm  here to  protect  her

362
00:20:37,552 --> 00:20:39,187
Officer  Eric  Boggs
became  a  policeman…

363
00:20:39,187 --> 00:20:41,690
to  protect and  serve
the  innocent…

364
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,692
a  duty  he took
very seriously…

365
00:20:43,692 --> 00:20:45,560
which  is  why  he
is  still  on  patrol

366
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,229
His  new  beat?

367
00:20:47,229 --> 00:20:49,493
The  Twilight Zone
