Deuces  wild    baby  boy

Show  him  he  can't
mess  with  the  Deuces

15
00:00:43,063 --> 00:00:44,894
Marcus  Fisher

with  the  usual  vices...

19
00:00:49,803 --> 00:00:51,862
and  willing  to  do  anything
to  show the  world...

20
00:00:51,906 --> 00:00:53,874

in  a  little thing
called  consequence

23
00:00:57,845 --> 00:01:01,008
Because tonight

Hey    you!

l  figure  it deserves
a  little  better

32
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:27,339
Better?  Better
than  what    man?

33

Stop!  Turn  around    man

You're traveling
to  another  dimension

66
00:03:47,748 --> 00:03:51,411
A  dimension  not only
of sight and  sound...

67
00:03:51,452 --> 00:03:54,478
but of  mind

68
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:58,048
A journey  into
a  wondrous  land...

69
00:03:58,092 --> 00:04:02,290
whose  boundaries  are  only
that of the  imagination

90
00:05:17,337 --> 00:05:18,736
is  my side  of the  bed

91
00:05:18,772 --> 00:05:20,967
Heh  heh.  No    l  don't

Are you  good?

00:05:30,818 --> 00:05:32,809
Yeah    yeah.  My arm  hurts!

99
00:05:32,853 --> 00:05:36,084
Yeah    well    cops  are  edgy

100
00:05:36,123 --> 00:05:37,112
You  heard

101
00:05:37,157 --> 00:05:38,454
Nah.  Hear  what?

102
00:05:38,492 --> 00:05:40,483
Last  night  
somebody got shot dead

103
00:05:40,527 --> 00:05:41,619
They got  no  witnesses

104
00:05:41,662 --> 00:05:43,926
Ho    oh.  What a  surprise

105
00:05:43,964 --> 00:05:46,398
Yeah?  lt  happened
over there  by the  wall

106
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:48,196
You  just jogged
right  by  it

107
00:05:48,235 --> 00:05:49,964
You  sure you  didn't
see  nothing?

108
00:05:50,003 --> 00:05:50,992
No    man

109
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:54,405
His  name  was  Henry  Santos

110
00:05:54,441 --> 00:05:56,705
You  know    he  was
an  artist  like you

111
00:05:56,743 --> 00:05:58,233
Everybody  loved  this  guy

112
00:05:58,278 --> 00:05:59,677
Hey    that sucks

Let  me  see－－

115
00:06:05,285 --> 00:06:06,752
You're  still

116
00:06:06,787 --> 00:06:08,345
Writing    writing    man

117
00:06:08,388 --> 00:06:10,686
That's  what  l  do...
and  l'm  not gonna  stop

118
00:06:10,724 --> 00:06:11,884

119
00:06:11,925 --> 00:06:14,758
l've  been  a  gang
counselor for  1 5 years

120
00:06:14,795 --> 00:06:15,887
You  all  say
the  same thing

121
00:06:15,929 --> 00:06:17,863
You're  right.  Since you
got  it all  down...

122
00:06:17,898 --> 00:06:19,195
l  don't  know
what you  need  me for

123
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:21,861
l  need  you  not to  wind
up  dead  like  Santos!

124
00:06:21,902 --> 00:06:24,871
That's  a  tonto  way    man...

125
00:06:24,905 --> 00:06:27,135
and  that's
through  and  through

126
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:30,533
Go  on

127
00:06:30,577 --> 00:06:32,238
Finish  your jog

128
00:06:44,157 --> 00:06:46,182
Stop!  Turn  around    man!

129
00:06:46,226 --> 00:06:47,955
You  ready to  die for that?

130
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:50,255
That's  my sign

131
00:07:04,111 --> 00:07:05,840
Where'd  you  go  so  early?

132
00:07:07,514 --> 00:07:09,175
You  went  back to the  wall  
didn't you?

133
00:07:09,216 --> 00:07:10,376
Look    l  wasn't tripping

134
00:07:10,417 --> 00:07:13,079
Come  on.  Help  me flip  it

135
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,179
l  got  lumps
in  the  mattress...

136
00:07:15,222 --> 00:07:16,712
you've  got  him
in  your  head

137
00:07:16,757 --> 00:07:19,726
The  picture  of  his  body－－
it was  still  there

138
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,126
OK?  l－－l  just wanted  to
cover  it  up    that's  all

139
00:07:22,162 --> 00:07:24,027
Yeah    and  now you're  all
down  and  frown  material

140
00:07:24,064 --> 00:07:25,793
Baby    l  told  you
last  night    OK...

141
00:07:25,832 --> 00:07:28,300
it's  somebody    maybe  one
of the  guy's  people...

142
00:07:28,335 --> 00:07:29,962
but somebody's
trying  to  lay down...

143
00:07:30,003 --> 00:07:31,630
a  guilt trip  on  you
and  play with  your  head

144
00:07:31,672 --> 00:07:33,162
Look    l  didn't want
to  shoot that  man

145
00:07:34,908 --> 00:07:36,398
l  couldn't

146
00:07:36,443 --> 00:07:37,467
He  asked  for trouble...

147
00:07:37,511 --> 00:07:38,705
the  second  he  started
fooling  with  the tags

148
00:07:38,745 --> 00:07:41,839
Look    it was  an  accident!  OK?
String  and  the  brothers...

149
00:07:41,882 --> 00:07:43,076

l'm  a  hero  or  something...

150
00:07:43,116 --> 00:07:45,880
and    hell    l－－l  didn't
even  wanna  do  it

151
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,910
Yeah    and  that  is  gonna
stay our  little  secret

152
00:07:47,955 --> 00:07:50,116
You  wanted
to join  the  Deuces－－

153
00:07:50,157 --> 00:07:51,886
now you're  in

154
00:07:51,925 --> 00:07:53,654
You  have
to  stop your  mind...

155
00:07:53,694 --> 00:07:56,527
from  turning  to the
things that can't  be    OK?

156
00:07:56,563 --> 00:07:57,552
OK?

157
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,259
OK

158
00:08:10,611 --> 00:08:12,977
A  Deuces  man.
Now you're  in

159
00:08:14,214 --> 00:08:17,581
First one's  always the
hardest    though    you  know?

160
00:08:17,618 --> 00:08:21,076
Last  night    this  one  here
became the  real  deal

161
00:08:21,121 --> 00:08:23,954
Mad  props    Picasso

162
00:08:23,991 --> 00:08:25,822
To  Marcus    y'all

－Deuces  wild    boy!

164
00:08:28,061 --> 00:08:29,255
Deuces  wild    baby

165
00:08:31,331 --> 00:08:32,298
Yeah    Marcus

166
00:08:32,332 --> 00:08:33,697
You  the  man

167
00:08:36,837 --> 00:08:37,826
Now you're  a  deuce

168
00:08:52,853 --> 00:08:54,286
Yeah?

169
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:56,016

Yo    hang  on!

00:09:04,031 --> 00:09:06,226
How you  doing    Marcus?

173
00:09:06,266 --> 00:09:07,756
Ha.  Look    l'm  all  right

174
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:09,268
Thought we'd  go
for  a  ride

175
00:09:09,302 --> 00:09:10,701
Ohh.  Yeah    look

176
00:09:10,737 --> 00:09:12,705
lf  l  hear  another
ex－gangbanger  speech  again...

177
00:09:12,739 --> 00:09:15,071
l  might shoot  myself  
so  l'm  just gonna...

178
00:09:15,108 --> 00:09:17,008
Oh    no.
l  give you  my word

179
00:09:17,044 --> 00:09:19,274
No    look    maybe

180
00:09:19,312 --> 00:09:20,540

181
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,138
Let's  go

182
00:09:22,182 --> 00:09:23,615
l  wanna  show you  something

183
00:09:28,321 --> 00:09:29,652
You  seen  this?

184
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:33,456
“Urban Artist's  Digest. ”
What's this?

185
00:09:33,493 --> 00:09:34,687
You  read  that    don't you?

186
00:09:34,728 --> 00:09:37,822
Tsh.  Yeah    once

187
00:09:37,864 --> 00:09:40,162
Just  before  l  got
a  flu  shot.  Why?

188
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,895
Guess  who's  in  that  issue?

189
00:09:44,237 --> 00:09:46,603
Henry  Santos

190
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,766
You  know    the    uh  
guy that－－

191
00:09:47,808 --> 00:09:49,935
Yeah    yeah    yeah    man.
l  know  already    all  right?

192
00:09:49,976 --> 00:09:51,773
Did  you  know
how  good  he  was?

193
00:09:51,812 --> 00:09:53,609
Apparently this young
man  had  a  great future

194
00:09:53,647 --> 00:09:56,411
He  was  a－－a  rising
young  street artist

195
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,439
They say all  that

196
00:09:57,484 --> 00:09:58,610
Yeah    all  that    huh?

197
00:09:58,652 --> 00:09:59,880
Now    don't ask  me  what's  art

198
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,445
Victoria's  Secret's
catalogue...

199
00:10:02,489 --> 00:10:03,615
That's  art

200
00:10:03,657 --> 00:10:05,249
Look    man    is this
what you  wanted  to  show  me?

201
00:10:05,292 --> 00:10:07,624
Huh?  OK.  l  seen  it.
Let  me  out

202
00:10:07,661 --> 00:10:09,959
Can  you  let  me  out    please?

203
00:10:09,996 --> 00:10:11,759
Damn

204
00:10:11,798 --> 00:10:12,958
ln  a  sec

205
00:10:15,936 --> 00:10:17,927
Whoa.  Now  
that ain't good

206
00:10:23,977 --> 00:10:26,241
So    what  happened
last  night    Marcus?

207
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:28,747
l  don't  know.  Yesterday
turned  into today?

208
00:10:28,782 --> 00:10:30,647
Tsh.  l  don't  know  
all  right?

209
00:10:30,684 --> 00:10:32,276
Are you  sure?

210
00:10:35,355 --> 00:10:37,118
Go  on

211
00:10:37,157 --> 00:10:38,954
Go  ahead.  Take  a  look

212
00:11:06,086 --> 00:11:09,214
You  think  someone's
trying  to  show  me  something?

213
00:12:38,545 --> 00:12:39,842
Marcus

214
00:12:42,983 --> 00:12:44,712
－Marcus－－
－l  destroyed  it

215
00:12:46,286 --> 00:12:47,344
l  destroyed  it...

216
00:12:47,387 --> 00:12:49,321
and  a  minute  later  
not even...

217
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:52,123
lt was  all  back.  Heh

218
00:12:52,158 --> 00:12:54,149
Telling  more

219
00:12:54,194 --> 00:12:56,128
l  saw  it.  l  saw  it

220
00:12:56,162 --> 00:12:57,356
Baby    you're just
feeling  guilty

221
00:12:57,397 --> 00:12:59,388
Feeling?

222
00:12:59,432 --> 00:13:00,865
Feeling?

223
00:13:00,901 --> 00:13:02,698
l  am  guilty

224
00:13:02,736 --> 00:13:05,466
No.  No    no.  See    you  have
to  stop thinking  like that

225
00:13:05,505 --> 00:13:07,063
You  have to!

226
00:13:11,378 --> 00:13:12,902
They saw you  with  Rosas

227
00:13:12,946 --> 00:13:14,641
Yeah?  And?

228
00:13:14,681 --> 00:13:16,080
They think  he  might
try to  get you  to  confess

229
00:13:16,116 --> 00:13:17,174
What?

230
00:13:17,217 --> 00:13:18,241
And  then  start snitching
on  everyone

231
00:13:18,285 --> 00:13:19,411
No.  Don't－－Do  not－－

232
00:13:19,452 --> 00:13:21,010
And  if they think...

233
00:13:21,054 --> 00:13:22,817
that you  are  snitching
to the  cops through  Rosas...

234
00:13:22,856 --> 00:13:24,323
kin  ain't gonna  mean  much...

235
00:13:24,357 --> 00:13:27,053
even  if  my cousin  String
is the  leader  of the  Deuces

236
00:13:27,093 --> 00:13:28,082
l  gave  up  nothing

237
00:13:29,496 --> 00:13:31,930
They will  deal  hard
with  you    Marcus

238
00:13:31,965 --> 00:13:34,798
Yeah!  l  know

239
00:13:37,103 --> 00:13:39,162
Where  are you  going    baby?

240
00:13:39,205 --> 00:13:41,070
Goin' to  mind
my  business

241
00:13:57,524 --> 00:14:00,049
You  tired  of  running?

242
00:14:01,328 --> 00:14:03,694
l  mean    l  see you
taking  the  bus  now

243
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,925
By the  way  
the  police  showed  me...

244
00:14:05,966 --> 00:14:08,093
the  coroner's  report
on  Santos'  death

245
00:14:08,134 --> 00:14:10,227
He  had  powder  burns
on  his  right  hand...

246
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,965
and  up  his  right arm

247
00:14:13,173 --> 00:14:15,505
He  probably  had
a  grip  on  the  barrel

248
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:17,476
Yeah    that takes  brains

249
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,569
Yeah

250
00:14:19,612 --> 00:14:22,945
Or  else  he  was  pretty sure that
the  dude  holding  the  gun...

251
00:14:22,983 --> 00:14:24,951
wasn't gonna  shoot

252
00:14:24,985 --> 00:14:26,976
But then    bang!

253
00:14:28,054 --> 00:14:30,955
The  gun  went off  by accident

254
00:14:30,991 --> 00:14:33,425
ls that
what  happened    Marcus?

255
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:36,054
How  am  l  supposed  to  know?

256
00:14:36,096 --> 00:14:39,896
'Cause  l  saw the  wall  
and  that's you    bro

257
00:14:39,933 --> 00:14:41,230
ls that what  happened?

258
00:14:41,267 --> 00:14:42,734
ls that the  way you're
gonna  tell  everybody...

259
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:43,793
how  it went down?

260
00:14:43,837 --> 00:14:45,566
'Cause you  know  something...

261
00:14:45,605 --> 00:14:47,937
but you're  afraid  of what
the  Deuces  will  do    huh?

262
00:14:47,974 --> 00:14:49,373
You  are  so  wrong    man

263
00:14:49,409 --> 00:14:51,434
You're  afraid
of the truth    aren't you?

264
00:14:56,616 --> 00:14:58,447
l  ain't afraid  of  nothin'!

265
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,452
Oh    yeah.
You're  proud  of that?

266
00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:04,081
ls that you?

267
00:15:04,124 --> 00:15:05,682
ls that  how
you're  gonna  live?

268
00:15:05,725 --> 00:15:07,352
Snap the freakin'
picture    man

269
00:15:07,394 --> 00:15:08,861
That's  how you're
gonna  die!

270
00:15:08,895 --> 00:15:10,829
That's  not a  tattoo

271
00:15:10,864 --> 00:15:12,126
That's  a  brand

272
00:15:12,165 --> 00:15:14,156
You're their  slave.
They own  you

273
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,067
You  think that  String  and
that  bunch  care  about you?

274
00:15:17,103 --> 00:15:19,230
You're  damn  right they care

275
00:15:19,272 --> 00:15:21,604
Well    they don't.  They
care  about the  wrong  things

276
00:15:21,641 --> 00:15:24,235
The  only  reason  they're
keeping  you  around...

277
00:15:24,277 --> 00:15:26,871
is just to  keep you  down

278
00:15:26,913 --> 00:15:29,609
Because they  know
what  l  know－－

279
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:31,913
that you  can  be
something  else...

280
00:15:31,951 --> 00:15:33,475
and  they can't

281
00:15:38,224 --> 00:15:39,384
Hey    Rosas

282
00:15:43,363 --> 00:15:46,764
When  you  got out
of the  gang  life    right...

283
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,597
what got good?

284
00:15:48,635 --> 00:15:50,068
First    l  mean

285
00:15:50,103 --> 00:15:53,334
Not  having  to  look
over  my shoulder

286
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,531
l'll  see you  around

287
00:15:59,846 --> 00:16:01,973
He's  a  gang  counselor

288
00:16:02,015 --> 00:16:04,483
Let  me  drop
some  knowledge  on  you

289
00:16:05,618 --> 00:16:08,883
He  ain't counseling  you
on  how to  be  in  a  gang

290
00:16:08,922 --> 00:16:10,822
You  understand  that    huh?

291
00:16:10,857 --> 00:16:12,119
Yeah.  Yeah    man

292
00:16:12,158 --> 00:16:13,955
Then  what the  hell  you  doing
yapping  and  ride－sharing...

293
00:16:13,993 --> 00:16:15,119
with  your  new  best friend...

294
00:16:15,161 --> 00:16:16,560
who  wanna  teach  your  ass
to  be  out of a  gang?

295
00:16:16,596 --> 00:16:18,826
No    he's  dogging  me    man.
You  don't  understand－－

296
00:16:18,865 --> 00:16:19,832
ls that what
you  want?  Huh?!

297
00:16:19,866 --> 00:16:20,833
No    String

298
00:16:20,867 --> 00:16:21,834
To  be  out of a  gang?

299
00:16:21,868 --> 00:16:23,768
Look    it won't...

300
00:16:23,803 --> 00:16:26,067
He  won't  leave  me
alone    all  right?

301
00:16:26,106 --> 00:16:28,768
Yeah?  Askin'
about our  business?

302
00:16:28,808 --> 00:16:30,036
Huh?

303
00:16:30,076 --> 00:16:32,636
What we  got?
Where  we  go?

304

308

Well    you  don't
look  so  good

309
00:16:44,557 --> 00:16:45,524
Hmm?

310
00:16:45,558 --> 00:16:46,684
Mm－mm

00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:50,994
You  know    man

00:16:58,138 --> 00:16:59,298
No    man

317
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:01,102
Don't  hurt  him!

318
00:17:02,142 --> 00:17:03,268
Shauna?

319
00:17:03,309 --> 00:17:04,503
Please    he's just－－

320
00:17:04,544 --> 00:17:06,671
he's just a  little
messed  up  right  now    and...

321
00:17:06,713 --> 00:17:08,544
He's  gonna  be  better.
He'll  fix  it

322
00:17:08,581 --> 00:17:11,106
What you  saying    girl?
You  all  is  playing  so  much

323
00:17:11,151 --> 00:17:12,118
Fix  what?

324
00:17:12,152 --> 00:17:13,642
The  wall.  l  just saw  it

325
00:17:14,854 --> 00:17:16,685
l  thought you
all  saw the  wall...

326
00:17:16,723 --> 00:17:18,486
and  l  came  here for  Marcus

327
00:17:22,162 --> 00:17:23,322
Let's  go    man

328
00:17:27,433 --> 00:17:29,765
You  gotta  be  kidding  me

329
00:17:29,802 --> 00:17:31,463
No freakin'  way

330
00:17:49,856 --> 00:17:51,847
That takes  balls    Picasso

331
00:17:53,293 --> 00:17:55,386
Yeah.  Cool

332
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,430
You're  a  deuce  now    Picasso

333
00:18:00,466 --> 00:18:02,661
That's  all  there  is to  it

334
00:18:02,702 --> 00:18:04,465
Sweet    baby  boy

335
00:18:04,504 --> 00:18:07,234
Dumb    but sweet

336
00:18:14,147 --> 00:18:16,047
l  don't  know
how you  did  it...

337
00:18:16,082 --> 00:18:18,880
but you  did  it    baby

338
00:18:18,918 --> 00:18:22,183
You're  a  superstar  now.
Can  you  feel  it?

339
00:18:23,823 --> 00:18:26,883
Oh.  No    baby

340
00:18:26,926 --> 00:18:28,291
lt's  all  wrong

341
00:18:28,328 --> 00:18:31,195
Nothing's  wrong    Marcus.
Nothing

342
00:18:32,732 --> 00:18:33,926
l  gotta  fix  it

343
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,532
Just  leave  me  alone

344
00:19:52,512 --> 00:19:54,537
No!

345
00:20:01,054 --> 00:20:02,282
Rosas!

346
00:20:02,322 --> 00:20:03,482
Marcus!

347
00:20:03,523 --> 00:20:05,320
l  shot  him.
l  did  it!  l  shot  him!

348
00:20:05,358 --> 00:20:06,655
Whoa    whoa.
Easy    easy    easy

349
00:20:06,693 --> 00:20:09,662
l  can't get free  of  it    man.
l  did  it    OK?!

350
00:20:09,696 --> 00:20:12,824
OK?  Look    look.
J-just  look!  Look!

351
00:20:25,244 --> 00:20:26,905
l  shot  Santos

352
00:20:29,048 --> 00:20:30,037
l  know

353
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:34,042
l  didn't－－l  didn't
mean  to  do  it    man

354
00:20:34,087 --> 00:20:35,918
l  know that    too

355
00:20:37,357 --> 00:20:38,551
You're  not a  killer    Marcus

356
00:20:42,428 --> 00:20:45,056
l'm  good  now.
l'm  good  now

357
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,067
A  mark  on  a  wall  
ink  under the  skin...

358
00:20:58,111 --> 00:20:59,669
Easy enough  things
to  remove...

359
00:20:59,712 --> 00:21:01,407
with  enough
pain  and  effort

360
00:21:01,447 --> 00:21:03,415
But only
an  act of contrition...

361
00:21:03,449 --> 00:21:06,509
could  erase the tag
on  Marcus  Fisher's  soul...

362
00:21:06,552 --> 00:21:09,020
in  the  Twilight Zone
