if you take them away from me and I've been here longer than a year.

145
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,230
这就够了
That's enough.

146
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,740
然后有些事情变得非常糟糕
And then something goes terribly wrong.

147
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:57,420
在玫瑰仪式上
At the rose ceremony.

148
00:08:57,421 --> 00:08:59,280
一切都变得更加激烈
everything got so much more intense.

149
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,100
单身汉生活的时候 一切都要来了
It's all coming up when the Bachelors live.

150
00:09:08,101 --> 00:09:09,690
季首播集继续
Season premiere continues.

151
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,520
在红毯上
To the bachelor red carpet,

152
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:37,470
我们今晚在好莱坞还活着
we are alive here in Hollywood tonight.

And your favorite bachelor stars are all here getting ready for the exciting life premiere of the new season of the bachelor.

154
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,280
在事情真正开始之前
Before things really get started,

155
00:09:50,281 --> 00:09:54,570
让我们来谈谈我们在这个节目中遇到的最受欢迎的一对
let's talk to one of the most beloved couples we have ever had on this show.

156
00:09:54,571 --> 00:09:55,620
准备好
Get ready,

157
00:09:55,621 --> 00:09:56,460
女士们 先生们
ladies and gentlemen,

158
00:09:56,461 --> 00:09:57,480
子弹和凯瑟琳
shot and Catherine.

159
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,550
伙计们来了
Guys come on up.

160
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,380
这太疯狂了
This is insane,

161
00:10:10,381 --> 00:10:11,130
很好
it's great,

162
00:10:11,131 --> 00:10:11,730
我喜欢它
I love it.

163
00:10:11,731 --> 00:10:15,600
当你去达拉斯的购物中心时 我想这就是你的感受
I assume this is what it's like for you when you go to the mall in Dallas.

164
00:10:15,601 --> 00:10:15,930
是的
Yeah,

165
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:16,590
不完全是
not quite,

166
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:16,800
我的意思是
I mean,

167
00:10:16,801 --> 00:10:19,050
这里有很多令人兴奋的地方
this is a lot of excitement here.

168
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:21,300
我们在红毯上的粉丝们
We're alive on the red carpet tons of fans here,

169
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:23,160
但我想知道的是你的生活
but what I want to know about is your life back,

170
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:23,670
还有达拉斯
and Dallas.

171
00:10:23,671 --> 00:10:27,180
你知道 订婚和婚礼让人兴奋不已
You know there was the excitement around the engagement and the wedding.

172
00:10:27,181 --> 00:10:28,710
但现在你只是一对老夫妻了
But now you're just an old married couple.

173
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,540
那么达拉斯的生活又如何呢
So how is life back in Dallas?

174
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:33,060
我们喜欢动物的生活
We like the animal life.

175
00:10:33,061 --> 00:10:33,810
生活是美好的
Life is great.

176
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:34,410
很简单
It's simple,

177
00:10:34,411 --> 00:10:35,670
你知道我们都在做我们的工作
you know we both do our jobs,

178
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:41,820
我们都在一起 花时间和对方 狗和家人在一起 我们都很爱
we both hang out and spend time with each other and the dogs and our family and we love.

179
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:45,180
这是一个无聊的新年
It is a boring like new years.

180
00:10:45,181 --> 00:10:48,930
我们在大新闻里坐在沙发上
We were on the couch in the big news.

181
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:50,220
显然是新婚之夜
obviously was the wedding night,

182
00:10:50,221 --> 00:10:51,420
但我觉得我的工作超出了这个范围
but I feel like work beyond that.

183
00:10:51,421 --> 00:10:54,150
我们讨论过孩子
So have we talked about kids,

184
00:10:54,151 --> 00:10:55,230
单身的婴儿
bachelor babies?

185
00:10:55,231 --> 00:10:57,600
我们已经谈过了
We have talked about them.

186
00:10:57,601 --> 00:10:57,930
是的
Yeah,

187
00:10:57,931 --> 00:11:00,510
我是说在我们的雷达上 我们只是在享受彼此
I mean there on our radar were just enjoying each other,

188
00:11:00,511 --> 00:11:03,360
肖恩喜欢说我们在练习
and Sean likes to say were practicing.

189
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:06,240
雷达有多大 它们在右边
How big is the radar is that they're on the right?

190
00:11:06,241 --> 00:11:07,530
或者这是什么意思
Or what does it mean?

191
00:11:07,531 --> 00:11:10,140
这是一个模糊的术语
It's kind of a vague term.

192
00:11:10,141 --> 00:11:10,470
我不知道
I don't know,

193
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:12,360
也许是二千零一十六
maybe maybe two thousand and sixteen,

194
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:13,590
你会看到一个婴儿
you'll see a baby,

195
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:14,070
爸爸
Papa,

196
00:11:14,071 --> 00:11:18,060
我不知道那可能不是最好的
I don't know that's probably not the best.

197
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:19,140
他知道这是怎么运作的
He knows how it works,

198
00:11:19,141 --> 00:11:19,530
但确实如此
but it does.

199
00:11:19,531 --> 00:11:20,610
你知道婴儿是从哪里来的吗
You know where babies come from?

200
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,730
我们要坐下来谈一谈
We're going to sit down and have the talk.

201
00:11:23,731 --> 00:11:25,800
我要让你和我的儿子同时坐下来
I'll sit you and my son down at the same time.

202
00:11:25,801 --> 00:11:26,370
我们会得到这个
we'll have this.

203
00:11:26,371 --> 00:11:26,850
好的
okay.

204
00:11:26,851 --> 00:11:29,160
你已经在克里斯的位置上了
You have been in chris's shoes.

205
00:11:29,161 --> 00:11:29,640
显然
Obviously,

206
00:11:29,641 --> 00:11:31,590
今晚是他生命中的一个大夜晚
tonight a big night in his life,

207
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:33,420
他可以永远改变他的生活
he could change his life forever.

208
00:11:33,421 --> 00:11:34,950
你认为他脑子里想的是什么
What do you think is going through his mind?

209
00:11:34,951 --> 00:11:35,520
现在
Right now?

210
00:11:35,521 --> 00:11:39,030
那些豪华轿车就要来了
Is those limos are about to arrive.

211
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:39,810
你知道
You know,

212
00:11:39,811 --> 00:11:46,020
对我来说 这完全是一片混乱 因为我想到了所有的可能性 可能会发生什么 我可能会经历什么
it was just complete chaos for me in my mind because I was thinking of all the possibilities and what might come and what I might experience,

213
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:54,090
我希望他能冷静下来 镇定下来 意识到这将影响他的生活
and I hope he's just able to kind of calm down and gather himself and realize that this is going to shape his life.

214
00:11:54,091 --> 00:11:55,050
它可能会
It possibly could,

215
00:11:55,051 --> 00:11:57,690
他需要单独观察每一个女孩
and he needs to look at every girl individually and kind of.

216
00:11:57,691 --> 00:12:01,440
穿舞会礼服和其他所有的东西看过去
see past the mansion in the ball gowns and everything else.

217
00:12:01,441 --> 00:12:02,490
看看那个女孩
And just look at the girl.

218
00:12:02,491 --> 00:12:03,300
你知道
and you know,

219
00:12:03,301 --> 00:12:08,190
我的希望是他找到了像我一样的第一个晚上的人
my my hope is that he finds someone like I did that first night.

220
00:12:08,191 --> 00:12:09,690
这是一团模糊的旋风
It is a whirlwind in a bit of a blur,

221
00:12:09,691 --> 00:12:14,400
但是 当你那天晚上在大厦前的时候 有那么一刻对你来说是很重要的吗
but is there a moment that stood out to you as you were there in front of the mansion that night?

222
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,200
我想在第一架豪华轿车停之前
I think before the first limo pulled up,

223
00:12:16,201 --> 00:12:20,040
这是一个多么离奇的时刻 我不知道谁会站出来
it was such a surreal moment and I didn't know who was going to step out,

224
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,240
我只花了一秒钟
and I just took a second.

225
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,860
我深吸了一口气
I took a deep breath,

226
00:12:22,861 --> 00:12:23,700
我低下头
I put my head down,

227
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:24,750
我快速地祈祷
said a quick prayer,

228
00:12:24,751 --> 00:12:25,740
然后 夜幕降临
and then the night began,

229
00:12:25,741 --> 00:12:27,720
剩下的都是模糊的
and the rest was a blur,

230
00:12:27,721 --> 00:12:30,120
你的祈祷应验了
and your prayer was answered.

231
00:12:30,121 --> 00:12:31,350
给我另一个好处
Give me the flip side of that.

232
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:32,850
因为他站在大厦前面
Because he's standing in front of the mansion.

233
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:35,070
他拥有他身后的单身汉的力量
He has the power of the bachelor behind him.

234
00:12:35,071 --> 00:12:37,680
今晚来的这些女人是什么感觉
What's it like for these women arriving tonight?

235
00:12:37,681 --> 00:12:44,730
我认为这是一种超级神经的折磨 你不知道你第一个晚上会和谁成为朋友 因为你不想独自坐在那里
I think it's just super nerve racking and you don't know who you're kind of going to befriend that first night because you don't want to sit around by yourself.

236
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:52,530
所以我很幸运地遇到了很多好女孩 享受了这个夜晚 这样就不会有太多的压力要和他见面
So I was lucky enough to meet a lot of good girls and enjoy the night so that there wasn't too much pressure on meeting him.

237
00:12:52,531 --> 00:12:54,420
所以我认为这对我来说很好
So I think that that worked out well for me.

238
00:12:54,421 --> 00:13:00,360
但我知道很多女孩会去喝酒以缓解紧张
But I know that a lot of girls are going to take to the alcohol to help release tension.

239
00:13:00,361 --> 00:13:02,520
但我很高兴我没有那样做
But I'm glad I didn't do that.

240
00:13:02,521 --> 00:13:04,740
今晚有一个特别的女孩
One girl in particular a little too much tonight.

241
00:13:04,741 --> 00:13:07,770
稍后你会看到可怜的塔拉
You'll see a little bit later on poor Tara.

242
00:13:07,771 --> 00:13:08,700
好了
All right,

243
00:13:08,701 --> 00:13:09,810
你们被藏在里面
you guys are hidden inside,

244
00:13:09,811 --> 00:13:11,130
但在你走之前
but before you go,

245
00:13:11,131 --> 00:13:13,590
充分利用这个单身国家的优势
take advantage of this bachelor nation is here in full force.

246
00:13:13,591 --> 00:13:14,190
他们爱你
They love you,

247
00:13:14,191 --> 00:13:15,330
男人们对凯瑟琳大叫
guys shout at Catherine,

248
00:13:15,331 --> 00:13:15,870
每个人
everybody.

249
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:19,620
尽情享受表演吧
Enjoy the show.

250
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:26,490
还有更多来自我们的红地毯
There is more to come from our live red carpet,

251
00:13:26,491 --> 00:13:28,740
Joshmarkets和莱西
Josh markets and lacy.

252
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:29,700
他们都在这里
They're all here.

253
00:13:29,701 --> 00:13:32,130
我们绝对准备好了真正的独家新闻
We are definitely ready to get the real scoop.

254
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:40,260
克里斯是我们第一次来这里的
Chris makes the women for the first time we are gonna be here.

255
00:13:40,261 --> 00:13:41,520
我的一生
all my life.

256
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,510
我们的总理
Our premier,

257
00:14:15,511 --> 00:14:19,050
我是这个单身汉的克里斯哈里森
I am Chris Harrison at this bachelor nation.

258
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,970
单身汉的家庭 我们在这个夏天爱上了单身汉
Bachelor family that we really fell in love with this summer as they fell in love on Bachelor.

259
00:14:26,971 --> 00:14:35,820
在天堂市场和Lacey市场
In Paradise Markets and Lacey markets.

260
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,670
很高兴见到你们
Great to see you guys,

261
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:39,510
你看起来很漂亮
you look beautiful,

262
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:44,010
我想最大的问题是我们都看到你在这个夏天爱上了你
I guess the big question you know we all saw you fall in love this summer has a go at you.

263
00:14:44,011 --> 00:14:44,850
伙计们
Guys are engaged,

264
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:47,880
但你还在热恋吗
but are you still just madly in love?

265
00:14:47,881 --> 00:14:48,210
尽管如此
Still,

266
00:14:48,211 --> 00:14:49,020
继续坚持下去
keep on keeping on.

267
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:49,860
是的
Yeah,

268
00:14:49,861 --> 00:14:53,310
在我们的婚礼中 有很多工作要做
in the middle planning our wedding and it's a lot of work,

269
00:14:53,311 --> 00:14:56,580
但是我试着给他们更多的输入就像我不能做的一样
but I'm trying to give them as much input as I can't do this one bug,

270
00:14:56,581 --> 00:14:58,890
所以这意味着你什么都不做
so which which means you're doing nothing.

271
00:14:58,891 --> 00:14:59,160
好的
OK,

272
00:14:59,161 --> 00:15:00,030
让我问你
let me ask you,

273
00:15:00,031 --> 00:15:01,410
你在湿角上做所有的工作
you're doing all the work on the wet angle.

274
00:15:01,411 --> 00:15:02,580
我们什么时候能期待
When can we expect?

275
00:15:02,581 --> 00:15:03,870
这给了我们一个将军
This gives us a general.

276
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,840
我们今年肯定在计划
We are definitely planning this year,

277
00:15:06,841 --> 00:15:08,460
希望在夏天的时候
hopefully in the summer time.

278
00:15:08,461 --> 00:15:11,550
我们现在正好是80岁和40岁
We're a little eighty and forty on the exact date right now,

279
00:15:11,551 --> 00:15:15,990
但计划肯定是在过去 我只是给他们一个日期 他会在那里
but the planning is definitely in the past that I just give them a date in the time he'll be there.

280
00:15:15,991 --> 00:15:19,020
但严肃地说 这几乎是一见钟情
but in all seriousness it was almost love at first sight,

281
00:15:19,021 --> 00:15:20,970
因为你们是我的单身汉和天堂
for you guys are bachelor and paradise to me.

282
00:15:20,971 --> 00:15:23,340
对我来说 这真是太棒了
It was amazing to watch for me.

283
00:15:23,341 --> 00:15:24,510
你们俩互相攻击
You guys were struck with each other,

284
00:15:24,511 --> 00:15:27,030
然后你就离开了 开始了自己的表演
and you just kind of went off and had your own show.

285
00:15:27,031 --> 00:15:29,370
你觉得克里斯今晚能找到吗
Do you think Chris could find that tonight?

286
00:15:29,371 --> 00:15:29,670
你知道
You know,

287
00:15:29,671 --> 00:15:30,000
克里斯
Chris.

288
00:15:30,001 --> 00:15:30,630
显然
Obviously,

289
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:31,020
当然
absolutely.

290
00:15:31,021 --> 00:15:33,240
我想他一定很容易找到爱情
I think he can definitely find love easily.

291
00:15:33,241 --> 00:15:34,440
他是一个像你一样的老男孩
He's a good old boy like you,

292
00:15:34,441 --> 00:15:34,950
我知道
and I know,

293
00:15:34,951 --> 00:15:38,760
他来自草根阶层 他的道德和价值观忠实于他
and he comes from grassroots and his morals and values stick true to him,

332

寻找爱情是一种竞争
Finding love is a competition,

344

但她在任何地方都找不到爱

克里斯可能会完全问他们一个对我来说太棒了

我可以躺在床上 生闷气 犯罪 或者我可以起床去上班 然后回来
I could stay in bed and sulk and crime or I could get up and go to work and give back.

即使我失去了我生命中的挚爱

00:22:58,051 --> 00:23:01,980
我冒着风险 我把自己放在这条线上
I'm taking the risk I'm putting myself on the line,

464
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:02,490

其中一个

这就把女孩们推到她们还没和克里斯谈过的女孩身上
That pushes the girls over the girls they haven't talked to chris' at all.

476

放松一下 然后和对方在一起玩

我觉得一旦你开始计划
I feel like once you start planning,

524
00:25:38,881 --> 00:25:39,900
虽然没有停止
though there's no stopping,

525
00:25:39,901 --> 00:25:45,330
所以我必须做好准备 他准备好去品尝所有的食物 喝下所有的酒

526
00:25:45,331 --> 00:25:46,470
在他们这样做之前
and until they do,

527
00:25:46,471 --> 00:25:47,910
你喝一点酒来品尝你知道的食物

我可以吃

在你这个季节 有一个来自爱荷华州的甜农

531
00:25:55,261 --> 00:25:58,530
但是他被抛入了美国的意识中
But he was thrown into the consciousness of America,

532
00:25:58,531 --> 00:25:59,910
每个人都爱上了这个人
and everybody has fallen in love with this guy.

533
00:25:59,911 --> 00:26:01,890
很明显他是我们的单身汉
Obviously he's our bachelor.

I said he was as kind to me when he laughed as he was when he got there,

542
00:26:19,021 --> 00:26:23,430

and I'm glad that people saw that there is not really a whole lot of secrets to him like he showed it.

543
00:26:23,431 --> 00:26:26,460

They really didn't like this guy.

590
00:28:02,161 --> 00:28:02,730
我说的对吗
Am I right?

591
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:06,540
我们来看看尼基 Ssl
Let's say what Nicky Ssl,

592
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:08,160
尽管接下来会发生
though it's all coming up next.

593
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:09,540
为什么
Why,

594
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:11,070
这是我们的医生给我的吗
here from our doctor for me?

595
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:15,030
Mitre
Mitre.

596
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:18,930
啊
Ah.

597
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,650
离开
Coming off.

598
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,190
所以我自己
So myself.

599
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:28,110
哦
Oh,

600
00:28:28,111 --> 00:28:28,770
我的上帝
my God,

601
00:28:28,771 --> 00:28:30,030
我想要建立
I want to set up,

602
00:28:30,031 --> 00:28:31,290
让游戏开始吧
let the games begin,

603
00:28:31,291 --> 00:28:33,330
把古怪的人带来
bring on the weirdos,

604
00:28:33,331 --> 00:28:36,750
然后是鸡尾酒会让每个人都大吃一惊
and then it's a cocktail party that will surprise everyone.

605
00:28:36,751 --> 00:28:37,200
为什么不呢
Why not?

606
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,430
多花点时间
Spend a little bit more aggressive.

607
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,620
我觉得自己很强大
I feel powerful.

608
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,670
后来这是一个令人震惊的玫瑰仪式
And later it's a shocking rose ceremony,

609
00:28:53,671 --> 00:28:55,350
没有其他的
like no other.

610
00:28:55,351 --> 00:28:57,300
一切都变得更加激烈
Everything got so much more intense.

611
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,930
我不知道这是100%对你来说
I had no idea that this would go like this is a hundred percent up to you.

612
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:12,630
这一切都是在单身汉的精彩的谎言首映式上出现的
It's all coming up on the exciting lie premiere of the bachelor.

613
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,270
优柔寡断
Vacillation.

614
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:23,700
我坠入了爱河
I fell in love.

615
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,710
一种特殊的时尚
A special fashion.

616
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,860
在好莱坞 看老板看不见单身汉
Viewing the owner sees no the bachelor here in Hollywood,

617
00:29:34,861 --> 00:29:42,960
但首先 我有一个核心 我们最近的一批夫妻要么已经结婚 要么即将成为约翰和凯瑟琳结婚
but first I had a core of our most recent batch of couples are either married or are about to be John and Katharine married.

618
00:29:42,961 --> 00:29:45,210
我们听说了约书亚的婚礼计划
We heard about any Joshua's wedding plans,

619
00:29:45,211 --> 00:29:51,060
我们要祝贺死亡和媒体 他们将会在短短几周内交换他们的誓言
and we'd like to congratulate deaths and press who will be exchanging their vows and just a short couple of weeks.

620
00:29:51,061 --> 00:29:51,420
然后
So then,

621
00:29:51,421 --> 00:29:54,060
胡安-巴勃罗和尼基之间发生了什么
what happened between Juan Pablo and Nicky?

622
00:29:54,061 --> 00:29:54,270
嗯
Well,

623
00:29:54,271 --> 00:29:56,310
你回答我们所有的问题
you to answer all of our questions.

624
00:29:56,311 --> 00:29:56,700
尼基
Nicky.

625
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,190
你好吗
How are you doing?

626
00:30:08,191 --> 00:30:10,230
我真的做得很好
I'm actually doing really great.

627
00:30:10,231 --> 00:30:10,560
是的
Yeah,

628
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:11,250
我真的很开心
I'm really happy.

629
00:30:11,251 --> 00:30:11,400
嗯
Well,

630
00:30:11,401 --> 00:30:14,310
显然 每个人都仍然深爱着你
apparently everyone is still very much in love with you.

631
00:30:14,311 --> 00:30:20,370
让我们回到上次你和我在这幢大楼里的最后一排特别的时候
Let's go back to the last time you and I were in this very building the after the final row special.

632
00:30:20,371 --> 00:30:24,180
对我们中的任何一个人来说 这都不是最好的时刻
It wasn't the best moment really for either one of us.

633
00:30:24,181 --> 00:30:27,030
带我回到你那天晚上的想法
Take me back in what you were thinking that night.

634
00:30:27,031 --> 00:30:29,910
很明显 你把所有的情绪都给了你
Obviously you kind of gave all of your emotions.

635
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:34,140
胡安-巴勃罗那天晚上并没有犯什么错
And then Juan Pablo didn't what went wrong that night.

636
00:30:34,141 --> 00:30:35,670
在你的眼中
In your in your eyes,

637
00:30:35,671 --> 00:30:36,120
我是说
I mean.

638
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:37,950
首先
First of all,

639
00:30:37,951 --> 00:30:41,130
在公众的眼里 很难有一段感情
it's really hard to have a relationship that's like seen in the public eye,

640
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:45,510
我觉得我很乐意表达我的感受
and I feel like I was comfortable with expressing my feelings,

641
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:46,620
他不是
and he wasn't,

642
00:30:46,621 --> 00:30:49,170
我知道在那天晚上 你知道
and I knew that going into that night and you know,

643
00:30:49,171 --> 00:30:51,450
这和他的女朋友很好
and that's fine as his girlfriend,

644
00:30:51,451 --> 00:30:55,350
我想要尊重这一点 因为我要站在我的男人身边
I wanted to respect that because I was going to stand by my man.

645
00:30:55,351 --> 00:30:56,310
你知道
You know,

646
00:30:56,311 --> 00:30:58,770
它将会是100%
with it going to be one hundred percent,

647
00:30:58,771 --> 00:31:00,060
我的选择
my choice.

648
00:31:00,061 --> 00:31:00,750
不
No,

649
00:31:00,751 --> 00:31:07,590
但我的意思是 我关心他 我想成为一个好女友 我想和她的男人站在一起
but I mean I cared about him and I wanted to be a good girlfriend and I wanted to stand by her man.

650
00:31:07,591 --> 00:31:10,830
这就是我那天晚上选择做的事情
And so that's what I chose to do that night.

651
00:31:10,831 --> 00:31:12,300
这是一种感觉
There was just this sense,

652
00:31:12,301 --> 00:31:13,860
通常当我们完成一场演出的时候
usually when we finish a show,

653
00:31:13,861 --> 00:31:15,330
特别是当我们有几个他们的时候
especially when we have a couple of theirs.

654
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:18,870
这是一种强烈的快乐感 我们都出去庆祝一下
Is this overwhelming sense of joy and we all go out and celebrate it.

655
00:31:18,871 --> 00:31:19,710
出于某种原因
For some reason,

656
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,480
这是一种敌意
there was just this kind of animosity.

657
00:31:21,481 --> 00:31:23,580
就像你们在对抗世界
it was like you guys against the world,

658
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:24,720
这必须很艰难
and that had to be tough,

659
00:31:24,721 --> 00:31:26,910
我敢肯定这是你不想要的
and I'm sure it's something you didn't want.

660
00:31:26,911 --> 00:31:28,590
我也不想要
I didn't want it either.

661
00:31:28,591 --> 00:31:28,920
我的意思是
I mean,

662
00:31:28,921 --> 00:31:34,290
没有人会为你在节目中发生的事情做好准备 就像在聚光灯下一样
No one prepares you for what's going to happen on the show and like it like being in the spotlight,

663
00:31:34,291 --> 00:31:38,730
但你知道 那晚我确实觉得这样做会更容易些
but you know that night I do feel like it could have been easier,

664
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:42,330
但是我在晚上的时候感到不开心
but I didn't feel happy at the end of the night.

665
00:31:42,331 --> 00:31:42,690
我只是
I just,

666
00:31:42,691 --> 00:31:45,450
我想让所有人都为我高兴
I wanted I wanted everyone else to be happy for me,

667
00:31:45,451 --> 00:31:47,520
我觉得这是被误解了
and I felt like it was misunderstood,

668
00:31:47,521 --> 00:31:49,230
它被误解有很多原因
and it was misunderstood for a lot of reasons.

669
00:31:49,231 --> 00:31:58,080
它被误解了 因为我们不能以一种我想要表达的方式来表达我们自己
It was misunderstood because we weren't able to express ourselves mostly him in a way that I wanted it to be expressed.

670
00:31:58,081 --> 00:32:00,570
我想让每个人都为我高兴
I wanted everyone to be happy for me,

671
00:32:00,571 --> 00:32:01,980
但你们确实做了一件事
but you guys did make a go of it.

672
00:32:01,981 --> 00:32:05,430
你和你的男人站在一起 你们最近也有过一段恋情
You stood by your man and you guys had a relationship recently.

673
00:32:05,431 --> 00:32:06,000
显然
Obviously,

674
00:32:06,001 --> 00:32:08,160
我们已经知道你已经分手了
we've read that you've broken up.

675
00:32:08,161 --> 00:32:08,850
发生了什么
What happened?

676
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:13,770
这不是因为两边都缺少火车
It's not from a lack of train on either side.

677
00:32:13,771 --> 00:32:14,160
你知道
You know,

678
00:32:14,161 --> 00:32:16,410
我非常努力 他努力地去做
I tried really hard and he tried hard to.

679
00:32:16,411 --> 00:32:17,400
只是
It's just,

680
00:32:17,401 --> 00:32:18,780
我是堪萨斯城的一名护士
I'm a nurse in Kansas City,

681
00:32:18,781 --> 00:32:20,190
他住在迈阿密
and he lives in Miami,

682
00:32:20,191 --> 00:32:23,340
他就像在娱乐行业 这是他的工作
and he's like in the entertainment industry and that's his job,

683
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:24,240
这就是他的生活方式
and that's his lifestyle,

684
00:32:24,241 --> 00:32:25,260
我只是
and I just.

685
00:32:25,261 --> 00:32:27,300
这对我来说真的很难适应
It was really hard for me to fit into that.

686
00:32:27,301 --> 00:32:29,940
在一天结束的时候 我们给了它一个机会
and at the end of the day we gave it a go.

687
00:32:29,941 --> 00:32:33,600
但我们是太不同的人 你确实做了一件事
But we're just too different people and you did make a go of it.

688
00:32:33,601 --> 00:32:34,050
事实上
In fact,

689
00:32:34,051 --> 00:32:36,360
甚至在一种谣言开始流传之后
even after a kind of rumors had started swirling about,

690
00:32:36,361 --> 00:32:37,080
你分手了
you're breaking up,

691
00:32:37,081 --> 00:32:41,100
你付出了努力 你去了迈阿密 给了它最后的努力
you made the effort and you went to Miami to just give it one last ditch effort.

692
00:32:41,101 --> 00:32:41,340
是的
Yeah,

693
00:32:41,341 --> 00:32:44,520
我绝对不会放弃 因为我不是一个放弃的人
absolutely like I wasn't going to quit like I'm not a quitter.

694
00:32:44,521 --> 00:32:46,380
所以我尝试了所有的东西
And so I tried everything,

695
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:47,940
我知道他试过
and I know he tried to.

696
00:32:47,941 --> 00:32:49,560
我的意思是 这不仅仅是单方面的事情
I mean it wasn't just a one sided thing,

697
00:32:49,561 --> 00:32:50,940
但就像在一天结束的时候
but like at the end of the day,

698
00:32:50,941 --> 00:32:52,020
我们有不同的侧重点
we have different priorities.

699
00:32:52,021 --> 00:32:55,410
我们有不同的生活方式 这就是它的样子
we have different lifestyles and it just it is what it is like it,

700
00:32:55,411 --> 00:32:59,520
我们尝试过 我们的现实生活不像电视上的尝试
we try and we real life tried not just like TV tried,

701
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:01,140
但我的意思是 我同意这一点
But I mean in and I agree with that,

702
00:33:01,141 --> 00:33:06,000
我知道 因为你要做的一件容易的事就是离开 因为艰难的事情是留下来
I know because the easy thing for you to do would have been to walk away because the tough thing was to stay,

703
00:33:06,001 --> 00:33:07,980
但是你说你有不同的优先级
but you said you have different priorities,

704
00:33:07,981 --> 00:33:08,910
我知道你很友善
and I know youre being nice.

705
00:33:08,911 --> 00:33:11,520
但是你有优先考虑吗
But were you ever that priority?

706
00:33:11,521 --> 00:33:13,440
你是否觉得我所知道的最重要的事
Did you feel like the priority I know,

707
00:33:13,441 --> 00:33:14,490
比如你去迈阿密的时候
like when you went to Miami,

708
00:33:14,491 --> 00:33:18,540
当你在那个时候没有得到关注的时候 事情有点不太好
Things were a little off putting when you didn't get that attention in that time,

709
00:33:18,541 --> 00:33:23,430
我的意思是 我知道我知道我永远不会成为第一要务 就像他有一个女儿一样
I mean like I knew I knew I was never going to be the number one priority like he has a daughter.

710
00:33:23,431 --> 00:33:28,440
但我的意思是 在第七优先级中 第二优先级是有区别的
but I mean there's a difference between being like the second priority in the seventh priority.

711
00:33:28,441 --> 00:33:30,090
我的意思是
So I mean.

712
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:31,620
你知道
You know,

713
00:33:31,621 --> 00:33:37,740
只是我们只是不同的人有不同的东西他认为是可以的 我不认为他们是可以的
it's just that we're just different people and there's different things that he thinks are OK and I don't think they're okay.

714
00:33:37,741 --> 00:33:39,240
我们对他的看法从来都是不一致的
And we just never saw eye to eye on him.

715
00:33:39,241 --> 00:33:39,780
我们从来没有
and we just never.

716
00:33:39,781 --> 00:33:41,340
我们会对它的看法一致
We're going to see eye to eye on it,

717
00:33:41,341 --> 00:33:41,940
所以你想要它
so you want it.

718
00:33:41,941 --> 00:33:44,310
我的意思是显然有一个女儿和一个家庭是第一位的
I mean obviously has a daughter and family comes first.

719
00:33:44,311 --> 00:33:47,460
但就像你说的 你应该就在那后面
but like you said you should be right behind that.

720
00:33:47,461 --> 00:33:53,430
你是否觉得他对聚光灯的爱 在公众的眼中 成为其中的一部分
And did you feel like his love of the limelight and in the public eye and being a part of that,

721
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:56,880
羔羊的生活方式使他付出了代价 得到了他最好的
the lamb lifestyle kind of took took its toll and got the best of him.

722
00:33:56,881 --> 00:33:57,570
在某些方面
In some ways.

723
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,380
他喜欢成为娱乐行业的一员
He loves being part of the entertainment industry,

724
00:34:01,381 --> 00:34:03,510
不管他是不是在聚光灯下
whether he's in the spotlight or not.

725
00:34:03,511 --> 00:34:05,280
这是我不知道的
That's something I don't really,

726
00:34:05,281 --> 00:34:07,950
我真的不知道 因为我离它太远了
I don't really know because I am so far removed from it.

727
00:34:07,951 --> 00:34:11,550
我觉得当我在家的时候 我觉得这根本不是我的首要任务
I feel like when I'm at home like it's just it's not a priority for me at all,

728
00:34:11,551 --> 00:34:17,250
所以我们很难聚在一起 因为我从来没有见过他的样子
and so it's really hard for us to get together on that because I never saw it the way he saw it,

729
00:34:17,251 --> 00:34:18,270
我做到了
I did it,

730
00:34:18,271 --> 00:34:20,520
我想打开那些门
I guess to open up those doors.

731
00:34:20,521 --> 00:34:24,240
你是否觉得他真的爱上了你
Did you feel like he was ever really just in love with you,

732
00:34:24,241 --> 00:34:26,850
是关于你们和你们这段关系的吗
that it was about you and you guys in this relationship?

733
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:28,680
是的
Yes,

734
00:34:28,681 --> 00:34:32,730
有一段时间 我确实觉得他和我在一起
there was a while where I did feel like he was totally a lot with me.

735
00:34:32,731 --> 00:34:34,440
是不是太晚了
Was it too late?

736
00:34:34,441 --> 00:34:35,760
我们等着
We'll wait.

737
00:34:35,761 --> 00:34:36,330
这是怎么回事
Is that what happened?

738
00:34:36,331 --> 00:34:37,350
它实在是太少了
It was just too little,

739
00:34:37,351 --> 00:34:38,160
太晚了
too late.

740
00:34:38,161 --> 00:34:38,760
我只是
I just,

741
00:34:38,761 --> 00:34:39,120
我想
I think,

742
00:34:39,121 --> 00:34:39,660
在这一点上
at that point,

743
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:48,990
就像我刚刚得出的结论 我们是不同的人 我们永远不会在同一页上 而不是我有任何强烈的感情 在这种情况下我不能为他说话
like I had just come to the conclusion that like we're different people and we're never going to be on the same page and not that I have any hard feelings and I can't speak for him in the situation.

744
00:34:48,991 --> 00:34:50,280
但我知道
But I just knew that,

745
00:34:50,281 --> 00:34:52,770
就像我的生活方式永远无法融入他的生活
like my lifestyle was never going to fit in with his.

746
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,350
显然
Obviously,

747
00:34:55,351 --> 00:35:00,180
当事情变糟的时候 你会感到愤怒
you have felt the wrath of what you know when things went bad.

748
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,880
我知道你也有很多热量
I know you've got a lot of heat as well.

749
00:35:02,881 --> 00:35:04,410
你觉得怎么样
What was that like for you?

750
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,320
这是我遇到过的最困难的事情之一
That was one of the hardest things I've ever had to deal with.

751
00:35:07,321 --> 00:35:10,740
我觉得我还没准备好
I feel like I wasn't prepared for it,

752
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:11,670
就像每个人说的
like everyone says,

753
00:35:11,671 --> 00:35:11,850
哦
Oh,

754
00:35:11,851 --> 00:35:12,180
是的
yes,

755
00:35:12,181 --> 00:35:13,350
你签了名
you signed up for it,

756
00:35:13,351 --> 00:35:13,680
是的
and yes,

757
00:35:13,681 --> 00:35:14,100
我做到了
I did.

758
00:35:14,101 --> 00:35:14,430
你是对的
You're right,

759
00:35:14,431 --> 00:35:14,760
我做到了
I did,

760
00:35:14,761 --> 00:35:20,370
但是人们对我说的那些伤人的话 没有人能帮你做好准备
but the hurtful things that people said to me like it just no one can prepare you for that.

761
00:35:20,371 --> 00:35:25,440
这对我来说真的很难 我真的很幸运他能在那里支持我
and it was really hard for me and I'm really lucky that he was there to support me through that.

762
00:35:25,441 --> 00:35:26,070
因为
because.

763
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:27,870
我只是
I just,

764
00:35:27,871 --> 00:35:28,980
我处理得不好
I didn't handle it well,

765
00:35:28,981 --> 00:35:30,990
直到今天 我仍然觉得我在挣扎
and I still feel like I struggle with it to this day.

766
00:35:30,991 --> 00:35:32,580
我是说我是人类
I mean I'm human,

767
00:35:32,581 --> 00:35:39,090
我犯了错误 我还没有准备好让我的生活和我的爱情生活在国家电视台上播出
I make mistakes and I wasn't ready for my life and my love life to be broadcast on national television.

768
00:35:39,091 --> 00:35:40,410
你后悔什么吗
Do you regret anything?

769
00:35:40,411 --> 00:35:40,800
如果是这样
And if so,

770
00:35:40,801 --> 00:35:42,480
你最后悔的是什么
what do you regret the most?

771
00:35:42,481 --> 00:35:42,780
你知道
You know,

772
00:35:42,781 --> 00:35:46,710
我不后悔任何事情 因为我觉得自己成长得像一个人
I don't regret anything because I feel like I've grown so much as a person,

773
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:50,940
我真的很感激这次经历 因为我知道我是谁
and I am really grateful for the experience because I know who I am,

774
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:52,170
我知道我想要什么
and I know what I want,

775
00:35:52,171 --> 00:35:54,150
我知道我不想要什么
and I know what I don't want,

776
00:35:54,151 --> 00:35:55,380
你知道
and you know,

777
00:35:55,381 --> 00:35:55,710
我只是
I just,

778
00:35:55,711 --> 00:35:56,580
我真的很开心
I'm really happy.

779
00:35:56,581 --> 00:35:57,420
我现在很开心
I'm happy now,

780
00:35:57,421 --> 00:35:59,130
我爱我的生活
and I love my life.

781
00:35:59,131 --> 00:36:02,100
很多人在看你 知道我们在这里
A lot of people watching you know that night we were here.

782
00:36:02,101 --> 00:36:04,770
我们准备扔一些东西 比如不做
we were ready to throw things like making no,

783
00:36:04,771 --> 00:36:05,370
不要这样做
don't do this.

784
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,710
不要陷入这种关系
Don't get into this relationship.

785
00:36:07,711 --> 00:36:17,220
你在胡安巴勃罗看到的是我们都这么做了因为我认为很多人认为这整件事是注定要失败的
So what did you see in Juan Pablo that we all did it because I think a lot of people thought that this whole thing was set for failure.

786
00:36:17,221 --> 00:36:17,820
你知道
You know,

787
00:36:17,821 --> 00:36:19,260
我们都想救你
we were all trying to save you.

788
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:19,710
好的
OK,

789
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:20,430
但是你去了
but you went.

790
00:36:20,431 --> 00:36:20,670
所以
So.

791
00:36:20,671 --> 00:36:22,200
在胡安巴勃罗 我们没有看到什么
What did we not see in Juan Pablo?

792
00:36:22,201 --> 00:36:23,640
什么被误解了
What's misunderstood?

793
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:26,100
他是如此的带着你的真爱
He is so carry like you really does.

794
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,780
他很关心他的家庭
He cares so much about his family,

795
00:36:27,781 --> 00:36:29,430
他很关心他的朋友们
and he cares so much about his friends,

796
00:36:29,431 --> 00:36:31,320
他关心那些他信任的人
and he cares about people that he trusts,

797
00:36:31,321 --> 00:36:32,490
他真的
and he really.

798
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:33,540
他是个好人
He's a good person.

799
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:36,870
我没有什么不好说的
I don't have anything bad to say I just.

800
00:36:36,871 --> 00:36:38,760
这只是生活方式的不同
It's just a difference of lifestyles.

801
00:36:38,761 --> 00:36:40,590
他很关心我
And he cared so much about me,

802
00:36:40,591 --> 00:36:42,210
他关心我的家庭
and he cared about my family,

803
00:36:42,211 --> 00:36:44,490
他真的是一个好人
and he really is a good person.

804
00:36:44,491 --> 00:36:46,380
他现在真的是
He really is now.

805
00:36:46,381 --> 00:36:50,970
他无法真正表达自己的情感 说
There was so much made of the fact that he could never really speak his emotions and say,

806
00:36:50,971 --> 00:36:52,410
我爱你
I love you.

807
00:36:52,411 --> 00:36:54,450
他有没有告诉过你他爱你
Did he ever tell you he loves you?

808
00:36:54,451 --> 00:36:55,500
他做到了
He did absolutely.

809
00:36:55,501 --> 00:36:59,190
我想我告诉过你我将会是决定什么时候够了
I think I told you like I'll be the one to decide when enough is enough,

810
00:36:59,191 --> 00:37:03,090
我们之间的关系并没有结束 因为我们没有彼此相爱
and the relationship didn't end because we didn't love each other,

811
00:37:03,091 --> 00:37:03,360
你知道
you know,

812
00:37:03,361 --> 00:37:05,940
或者是因为缺乏沟通
or because of a lack of communication.

813
00:37:05,941 --> 00:37:09,750
它只是结束了 因为生活方式的不同你知道有一点
it just ended because the difference of lifestyles and you know there is a point where,

814
00:37:09,751 --> 00:37:10,950
就像我们说的
like we said,

815
00:37:10,951 --> 00:37:13,260
我们像正常的关系一样爱着对方
we loved each other like a normal relationship,

816
00:37:13,261 --> 00:37:20,940
你知道 这是一个不同的人 就像我希望人们能在路上知道的那样
and you know it just is a different person like I just wish that people can get to know in the way.

817
00:37:20,941 --> 00:37:22,470
我只是感觉到了
I just get the sense that again,

818
00:37:22,471 --> 00:37:26,340
它不会让你成为一个坏的男朋友或者不正确的人
it doesn't make you a bad person to be a bad boyfriend or not right,

819
00:37:26,341 --> 00:37:28,470
我能感觉到你在寻找什么
and I get the sense that what you're looking for,

820
00:37:28,471 --> 00:37:32,820
有些人会更专注于你 让你成为优先考虑的人
someone who will be a little more dedicated a little more into you and make you a priority.

821
00:37:32,821 --> 00:37:41,190
我觉得你从来没有觉得你是这段关系的优先级而打高尔夫球或参加派对总是有先例的
And I feel like you never felt like you were the priority in this relationship and that going golfing or going to parties are going always kind of took precedent.

822
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:42,570
对
Right,

823
00:37:42,571 --> 00:37:43,470
他只是
he's just,

824
00:37:43,471 --> 00:37:47,520
你知道 当你住在两个不同的地方 比如我住的地方 我想到的是这个城市
you know when it's hard when you live in two separate places like I living and I was thinking of the city.

825
00:37:47,521 --> 00:37:48,240
他住在迈阿密
He lived in Miami,

826
00:37:48,241 --> 00:37:50,880
所以他在迈阿密的生活对他来说是非常重要的
so his life in Miami was very much a priority for him.

827
00:37:50,881 --> 00:37:51,990
你知道
And you know,

828
00:37:51,991 --> 00:37:52,950
所以当我来的时候
so when I would come there,

829
00:37:52,951 --> 00:37:57,330
我觉得我就像是被扔进了他的生活
I feel like I was just kind of like thrown into his life,

830
00:37:57,331 --> 00:37:58,050
但话说回来
but then again,

831
00:37:58,051 --> 00:37:59,610
当他来到秦城时
when he came to Qin the city,

832
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:00,840
他刚刚被扔进了我的生活
he was just thrown into my life.

833
00:38:00,841 --> 00:38:03,570
所以这很难
So it's hard it was hard.

834
00:38:03,571 --> 00:38:06,450
从一开始就不容易
it wasn't easy from the start.

835
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:06,990
嗯
Well,

836
00:38:06,991 --> 00:38:08,250
我很高兴你来了
I'm glad you came here.

837
00:38:08,251 --> 00:38:10,230
我很高兴你又回到了单身家庭
I'm glad you're back a part of the bachelor family.

838
00:38:10,231 --> 00:38:11,670
我知道他的路很艰难
I know he's a tough road,

839
00:38:11,671 --> 00:38:12,810
但我很高兴你今晚能来
but I am glad you're here tonight,

840
00:38:12,811 --> 00:38:14,190
很高兴见到你
and it's great to see you.

841
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:14,550
尼基
Nicky,

842
00:38:14,551 --> 00:38:15,090
每个人
everybody.

843
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,430
上来
Coming up,

844
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:27,450
大约是在那个时候 每个人都要搬进来 一份生动的报告即将开始
it's about that time everybody is about to move inside and a lively report is about to begin.

845
00:38:27,451 --> 00:38:30,000
我们就会离开克里斯
We'll just moments away from Chris,

846
00:38:30,001 --> 00:38:31,080
意思是天气
meaning the weather.

847
00:38:31,081 --> 00:38:31,710
都被覆盖了
It's all covered.

848
00:38:31,711 --> 00:38:32,220
对象
objects.

849
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:50,520
啊
Ah.

850
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,210
一个美好的夜晚
A great night,

851
00:39:15,211 --> 00:39:19,110
我们又回到了哈里森市长的实验室
we've come back to the lab for mayor of the bachelor interest Harrison.

852
00:39:19,111 --> 00:39:24,990
每个人都在自己的座位上坐着 而现在在家里的工作室里
Everyone has taken their seats while they are taking their seats now here in the studio at home,

853
00:39:24,991 --> 00:39:26,460
酒已经倒了
the wine has been poured.

854
00:39:26,461 --> 00:39:30,480
每个参加单身汉幻想联盟的人都填满了他们的括号
Everyone who's part of a bachelor fantasy league has filled out their brackets.

855
00:39:30,481 --> 00:39:32,460
我希望这能带来好运
I hope good luck on that.

856
00:39:32,461 --> 00:39:33,930
今晚大家感觉怎么样
How's everybody feeling so far tonight?

857
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,620
这是玻璃做的
This is made of glass.

858
00:39:37,621 --> 00:39:40,350
你们都准备好参加这个单身汉聚会了吗
Are you all ready to get this Bachelor viewing party started.

859
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:42,360
嗯
Well,

860
00:39:42,361 --> 00:39:43,350
猜猜看 克里斯
guess what Chris,

861
00:39:43,351 --> 00:39:46,260
他寻找爱情的旅程现在开始了
His journey to find Love begins right now.

862
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,540
到洛杉矶来
To be here in LA.

863
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,110
在这批材料中
In the batch of material,

864
00:40:01,111 --> 00:40:02,460
一些身体上的经历
some out of body experiences.

865
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,950
他比我今晚的速度快得多
He's a lot faster pace than I like tonight.

866
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:16,170
这是一个完全不同的世界 在一平方英里的范围内 比我居住的整个殖民地的人都多
It's a whole different world this more people in a square mile than there is in the entire colony that I live.

867
00:40:16,171 --> 00:40:20,130
我更不愿意在交通繁忙的市中心开车
I'll let alone driving downtown in traffic that's intimate,

868
00:40:20,131 --> 00:40:23,460
但我愿意尽一切努力去寻找
but I'm willing to do whatever it takes to find,

869
00:40:23,461 --> 00:40:26,790
爱和坠入爱河 把它带回我自己的眼睛
love and fall in love and bring it back to my own eyes.

870
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,430
如果它无处不在
If it did everywhere,

871
00:40:29,431 --> 00:40:30,270
但这里呢
but here?

872
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:36,600
我已经脱离了我的联盟
I'm way out of my league here.

873
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:39,120
我正试着关掉最喜欢做的事情
I'm trying to close the favorite things to do.

874
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:47,790
中国说 我觉得这将是我想做下一件事的唯一原因 就像一种趋势
China says it feels like this is going to be just as much work as far as the only reason I want to do next pleasures like a trend,

875
00:40:47,791 --> 00:40:48,840
七千
seven thousand,

876
00:40:48,841 --> 00:40:50,610
五个旺季
five close season,

877
00:40:50,611 --> 00:40:53,910
戳戳和刺戳 而不是权利的趋势
poke and prod and less than rights trend.

878
00:40:53,911 --> 00:40:57,720
在精神上和体力上都让人精疲力竭
It's a lot of work mentally emotionally and physically exhausting.

879
00:40:57,721 --> 00:41:03,030
我们多么希望能像收割玉米一样把它藏起来 让他看到它或针
How young we wish that was as harvesting corn is putting the hidden it and let him see it or needles.

880
00:41:03,031 --> 00:41:03,570
最后
Last.

881
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:11,610
我知道我这么做是有正当理由的
I know deep down that I am doing this for the right reasons,

882
00:41:11,611 --> 00:41:12,810
是为了找到我的妻子
and it's to find my wife.

883
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:19,200
这就是我看到的全部目标
That's the whole goal I saw me.

884
00:41:19,201 --> 00:41:22,530
我可以离开这里 盖住别人的手指
I can leave here covering around someone's finger.

885

这可能是我最关心的问题

00:59:14,491 --> 00:59:16,800
这是真实的 这是真实的

那么为什么海象要去特百惠派对呢
