他引发监狱骚动 想趁混乱逃掉
Looks like he started a prison riot to cover the escape.

141
00:08:58,596 --> 00:08:59,836
他为什么这么做?
Why is he doing this?

142
00:08:59,836 --> 00:09:01,246
我们也想知道
That's what we're trying to figure out.

143
00:09:01,246 --> 00:09:02,646
你最近一次跟他联系是什么时候?
When's the last time you heard from him?

144
00:09:02,646 --> 00:09:04,236
半小时前
About a half hour ago.

145
00:09:04,366 --> 00:09:06,456
他要我签一份Ramon Salazar的转移令
He asked me to issue a transfer order

146
00:09:06,456 --> 00:09:09,446
并给了我密码
for Ramon Salazar and he gave me a password.

147
00:09:09,696 --> 00:09:10,696
你做了?
And you did it?

148
00:09:10,696 --> 00:09:12,816
是 他说Salazar需要转移
Yeah, he said that Salazar needed to be moved.

149
00:09:12,816 --> 00:09:14,946
但你现在又告诉我事情是假的?
But now you're telling me this isn't true?

150
00:09:15,786 --> 00:09:18,176
对 Kim 很抱歉 你爸对你说谎了
No, Kim. I'm sorry. Your dad lied to you.

151
00:09:20,106 --> 00:09:21,636
他为什么那么做?
Why would he do that?

152
00:09:21,836 --> 00:09:23,796
因为他知道 叫其它人做这件事
Because he knew if he asked anybody else

153
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:25,766
都会知道这样做违规了
they would know he was violating protocol.

154
00:09:30,426 --> 00:09:32,056
他会怎样?
What's gonna happen to him?

155
00:09:32,056 --> 00:09:33,686
我们正在找他
We're gonna try to find him.

156
00:09:33,836 --> 00:09:36,796
最好的解决办法就是找到Kyle Singer
The best way out of this whole situation is to find Kyle Singer.

157
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,946
这样你爸就会交出Salazar
Then your dad will give up Salazar.

158
00:09:39,136 --> 00:09:41,016
快去工作 帮助Adam
So go back to work, help Adam.

159
00:09:41,676 --> 00:09:43,036
好的
Yeah, sure.

160
00:09:45,246 --> 00:09:46,576
安全了
We're clear.

161
00:09:47,636 --> 00:09:50,526
在核查人数之前 我们得找到武装人员的入口
We gotta find all their forces through one entrance to keep the personnel count.

162
00:09:50,526 --> 00:09:52,426
肯定有别的出口 Jack
There must be another way, Jack.

163
00:09:52,576 --> 00:09:54,696
有是有 但被囚犯控制了
There is, but the prisoners have taken control.

164
00:09:54,696 --> 00:09:56,816
我们必须冲破重围
We're gonna have to fight our way through them.

165
00:09:58,016 --> 00:09:59,356
准备
Get ready.

166
00:10:21,456 --> 00:10:22,706
揍他们
Hit them up.

167
00:10:22,776 --> 00:10:23,846
快
Come on.

168
00:10:23,846 --> 00:10:25,596
来 让他们站起来
Come on. Get them on their feet.

169
00:10:32,386 --> 00:10:33,816
快走 快走!
Come on, let's go, let's go!

170
00:10:33,816 --> 00:10:35,306
快走 快!
Move, move it!

171
00:10:35,306 --> 00:10:36,536
我们走!
Let's go!

172
00:10:47,631 --> 00:10:48,951
别开枪!
Hold your fire!

173
00:10:48,976 --> 00:10:51,356
退后 我们有人质!
We have hostages so back off!

174
00:10:51,356 --> 00:10:52,976
别开枪!
Hold your fire!

175
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,326
来吧 伙计!
Come on man!

176
00:10:55,326 --> 00:10:56,686
我们能过去 走吧
We can make it through. We've got to move.

177
00:10:56,686 --> 00:10:58,126
快走!
Let's go!

178
00:10:58,296 --> 00:11:00,456
快走! 快!
Move! Let's go!

179
00:11:01,866 --> 00:11:03,366
快!
Go!

180
00:11:06,156 --> 00:11:07,556
快走! 快走!
Move it! Move it!

181
00:11:22,859 --> 00:11:24,389
为了达到目的
And in order to do this,

182
00:11:27,543 --> 00:11:30,063
必须储备石油资源
our fossil fuels must be conserved.

183
00:11:30,661 --> 00:11:33,001
Kim 你把卡尔曼滤波器发给我了吗?
Kim, did you send me that Kalman filter?

184
00:11:33,211 --> 00:11:34,351
什么?
What?

185
00:11:34,351 --> 00:11:36,391
卡尔曼滤波器 我要把那张图清晰化
The Kalman filter, I needed to clean up that image.

186
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:38,421
见鬼! 我给忘了 在我的工具箱里
Oh, shoot! I forgot about it. It's in my help box.

187
00:11:38,421 --> 00:11:40,551
你怎么能忘? 这是你手头唯一的工作
How can you forget about it? It's the only thing you're working on.

188
00:11:40,551 --> 00:11:41,891
对不起...
I'm sorry, look...

189
00:11:41,891 --> 00:11:43,321
我马上发给你
I'm sending it to you, right now.

190
00:11:43,321 --> 00:11:44,321
好了
Done.

191
00:11:44,321 --> 00:11:45,471
Kim 不知你脑子在想什么
Kim, I don't know where your head is at,

192
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:47,701
我们必须在Kyle Singer具有传染性前 找到他
but we need to find Kyle Singer before he's contagious.

193
00:11:47,701 --> 00:11:49,311
别紧张! 我正在尽力
Relax! I'm doing the best I can.

194
00:11:49,321 --> 00:11:51,071
我们要的不是尽力 Kim.
The best I can isn't what we do around here, Kim.

195
00:11:51,071 --> 00:11:53,771
- 是完成任务或者失败  - 干嘛对着我说教
- It's either done or it's not.  - So why are you lecturing me,

196
00:11:53,771 --> 00:11:55,301
已经发到你系统里了
it's in your system.

197
00:12:04,851 --> 00:12:05,731
我是Kaufman
Kaufman.

198
00:12:05,731 --> 00:12:07,121
你们怎么了?
Is there a problem?

199
00:12:07,341 --> 00:12:09,091
我只是想确保工作顺利开展...
I just need to make sure things are running smoothly around here...

200
00:12:09,091 --> 00:12:10,051
听着 Adam
Look, Adam.

201
00:12:10,051 --> 00:12:12,241
刚才没时间通知你...
I haven't had the chance to brief you but...

202
00:12:12,391 --> 00:12:15,181
Jack在监狱惹了乱子
Jack created a situation over at the prison.

203
00:12:16,471 --> 00:12:17,571
什么乱子?
What kind of situation?

204
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,661
为了救Salazar 引发了监狱暴动
He started a riot to free Salazar.

205
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:22,021
现在他俩被暴徒抓住了
Now they're caught up in the middle of it.

206
00:12:22,031 --> 00:12:23,371
啊
Wow.

207
00:12:23,641 --> 00:12:26,471
他利用Kim制作了转移令 跟着引起了这些麻烦
He even used Kim to create a transfer order that started the whole thing.

208
00:12:26,481 --> 00:12:28,451
给她点时间平复吧
So cut her a little slack.

209
00:12:29,511 --> 00:12:30,621
嗯...
Umm...

210
00:12:31,371 --> 00:12:32,631
好的 我明白了
Yeah, okay, I understand.

211
00:12:32,641 --> 00:12:34,381
现在大家的压力都很大
We're all under a lot of pressure here.

212
00:12:34,831 --> 00:12:37,121
在事情不可挽回前 尽快找到Kyle Singer吧
So let's just find Kyle Singer before it's too late.

213
00:12:37,401 --> 00:12:38,781
好的 谢谢你 Michelle
Yeah, okay. Thanks, Michelle.

214
00:12:46,911 --> 00:12:50,211
Kyle 你在干嘛? 我们没办法逃出去
Kyle, what are you doing? There's no way out of here.

215
00:12:52,341 --> 00:12:54,351
你不应该受到牵连
You don't deserve what happened.

216
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:56,811
我才是罪有应得
I do.

217
00:12:57,581 --> 00:12:59,081
如果我死了
If I die

218
00:12:59,201 --> 00:13:01,851
病毒也会跟着我死去!
the virus is dying with me!

219
00:13:06,841 --> 00:13:08,621
把脚放到凳子上!
Put your feet up here!

220
00:13:22,631 --> 00:13:25,101
Kyle 坚持住
Kyle, hold on.

221
00:13:49,881 --> 00:13:51,541
噢 Kyle
Oh, Kyle.

222
00:14:05,531 --> 00:14:08,021
"欢迎回家"晚会?
A "Welcome Home" party?

223
00:14:09,031 --> 00:14:10,961
你不该这么做
You shouldn't be doing this.

224
00:14:10,961 --> 00:14:12,901
你什么意思?
What are you talking about?

225
00:14:13,281 --> 00:14:15,841
你掌管着事务
You've been running things.

226
00:14:16,181 --> 00:14:19,131
让Ramon知道你是他的搭档
Show Ramon you're gonna be his partner.

227
00:14:20,221 --> 00:14:22,421
不是为他包办宴会的
Not his caterer.

228
00:14:22,581 --> 00:14:24,551
关你什么事?
Why do you care?

229
00:14:24,711 --> 00:14:26,631
你不是不想卷进我的事务中吗
You don't want to be involved in my business.

230
00:14:26,631 --> 00:14:29,001
不 宝贝 我关心你的
No, puppy, I care about you.

231
00:14:30,611 --> 00:14:34,161
我想让你得到你应得的一切
And I want you to get what you've earned.

232
00:14:46,531 --> 00:14:48,211
- 喂?  - 是我
- Yes?  - It's me.

233
00:14:48,211 --> 00:14:49,741
骚乱还在继续
Riot's still going on.

234
00:14:49,741 --> 00:14:51,261
但我们知道Ramon还活着
But we know Ramon's alive.

235
00:14:51,261 --> 00:14:52,421
对
Yeah.

236
00:14:52,421 --> 00:14:54,401
但Bauer很快就能带他出来
But Bauer's got to get him out soon.

237
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:57,131
反恐局很快就能找出Kyle Singer
CTU is getting close to finding Kyle Singer.

238
00:14:57,131 --> 00:14:59,721
如果被他们找到 Ramon就别想出来了
And if they do, they'll never let Ramon go.

239
00:14:59,911 --> 00:15:02,001
那就别让他们找到Singer
Then make sure they don't find Singer.

240
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,091
- 我正在想办法  - 快去做
- I'm working on it.  - Get it done.

241
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:22,341
就是他 他是Singer
That's him, that's Singer.

242
00:15:25,251 --> 00:15:26,741
那是只枪吗?
Was that a gun?

243
00:15:32,771 --> 00:15:34,001
对
Yeah.

244
00:15:34,111 --> 00:15:35,611
有人抓了他
Someone's got him.

245
00:15:36,301 --> 00:15:39,061
从这张图上看不到卡车的牌照
We're not gonna be able to get the truck's license plate from this shot.

246
00:15:39,551 --> 00:15:42,231
我去调用他们所去方向的交通录相
I'll get access to the traffic cameras in the direction they're heading.

247
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:44,051
看看能不能再发现他们
See if we can find them again.

248
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:49,251
我们发现47分钟前 Kyle Singer被人从商场带走了
We found Kyle Singer being driven away from the mall, 47 minutes ago.

249
00:15:49,251 --> 00:15:50,881
你们在查汽车牌照吗?
Are you working up a vehicle ID?

250
00:15:51,021 --> 00:15:53,291
找到此车的相关图像 就能查到
We will, as soon as we're able to get any visual.

251
00:15:53,631 --> 00:15:55,681
这个摄像机出了问题
This camera's damaged. It's malfunctional.

252
00:15:55,861 --> 00:15:57,651
他们肯定带着人质从右边经过
Must have the hostages on the right.

253
00:15:57,651 --> 00:15:59,141
试试转动摄像头
Try and pan the camera over.

254
00:15:59,141 --> 00:16:00,821
会被他们发现的
They may see the camera move.

255
00:16:00,831 --> 00:16:02,511
我们没得选择 快试试
We don't have a choice. Do it.

256
00:16:08,431 --> 00:16:09,891
他们在那儿
There they are.

257
00:16:13,051 --> 00:16:15,371
在他们杀人前 我们必须赶到那儿
We got to get in there before they start killing everyone.

258
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:20,731
快点! 快点!
Come on! Come on!

259
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:22,301
快! 快!
Faster! Faster!

260
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:25,571
让我们折磨这些狱警 直到他们放我们走
Let's start wasting the guards unless they let us walk

261
00:16:26,141 --> 00:16:28,001
敢走出去一步 砰!
First step outside, bang!

262
00:16:28,001 --> 00:16:29,861
脑袋马上开花
Headshot from a sniper.

263
00:16:29,861 --> 00:16:30,951
你知道个屁
You don't know that.

264
00:16:31,151 --> 00:16:33,281
我知道 在Chino时发生过这样的事
I know, cause that's what went down in Chino

265
00:16:34,311 --> 00:16:37,881
他们才不会管人质死活 因为他们的目的是不让我们出去
They'll let the guard get wasted cause all they care about is keeping us in.

266
00:16:37,941 --> 00:16:40,281
那我们怎么办?
What the hell are we doing here then?

267
00:16:45,401 --> 00:16:47,041
把枪给我
Give me your gun.

268
00:16:47,471 --> 00:16:49,191
带人质过来
Bring them over here.

269
00:16:49,411 --> 00:16:51,121
跟他们玩玩儿
We're gonna have a little fun with them.

270
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:52,721
让他们跪下
Put them on their knees.

271
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:57,781
谁不想死?
Who wants to live?

272
00:17:14,991 --> 00:17:16,971
好吧
Okay.

273
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,871
我再问一次
Let's try it again.

274
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,751
- 谁不想死?  - 我
- Who wants to live?  - Me.

275
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:24,511
我
I do.

276
00:17:24,581 --> 00:17:26,281
你 过来
Him. Over here.

277
00:17:26,281 --> 00:17:27,571
来吧
Come on.

278
00:17:32,091 --> 00:17:33,971
还有吗?
Who else?

279
00:17:38,411 --> 00:17:40,601
我以前从没见过你
I've never seen you before.

280
00:17:40,741 --> 00:17:42,651
我是新来的
I'm new here.

281
00:17:44,841 --> 00:17:46,871
你 过来
Him. Over here.

282
00:18:08,651 --> 00:18:10,401
六分之一的机会
One in six chance.

283
00:18:16,581 --> 00:18:19,111
你先来
You first.

284
00:18:19,341 --> 00:18:20,741
求你了
Please.

285
00:18:20,741 --> 00:18:22,791
别让我这么做
Don't make me do this man.

286
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:25,141
很简单的 小杂种
There's nothing to it, you little bitch.

287
00:18:25,141 --> 00:18:27,391
- 把枪指着你脑壳  - 不!
- Just put the gun to your head.  - I can't!

288
00:18:27,391 --> 00:18:29,261
我不...
I can't...

289
00:18:31,171 --> 00:18:32,771
照我说的做 听见了吗?
You're gonna do it. You hear me?

00:18:32,781 --> 00:18:35,881
- 照我说的做  - 求你了 求你了
- You're gonna do it.  - Please, please.

291
00:18:36,011 --> 00:18:38,071
简单得很 看着?
It's easy, see?

292
00:18:39,471 --> 00:18:41,791
你需要做的只是微笑着...
All you gotta do is smile...

293
00:18:42,481 --> 00:18:44,191
扣动板机
and pull the trigger.

294
00:18:54,311 --> 00:18:56,941
现在还有五分之一的机会
Now it's one in five.

295
00:19:07,901 --> 00:19:09,501
来吧!
Let's go!

296
00:19:20,171 --> 00:19:21,951
不!
No!

297
00:19:21,951 --> 00:19:23,901
不 我做不到...
No, I can't...

298
00:19:24,441 --> 00:19:25,451
做不到...
I can't...

299
00:19:28,341 --> 00:19:30,571
- 真浪费时间 杀了他  - 等等!
- This is a waste of my time. Shoot him.  - No, wait!

300
00:19:30,571 --> 00:19:32,371
- 杀了他!  - 等等!
- Shoot him!  - Wait!

301
00:19:33,621 --> 00:19:35,201
来吧 老兄
Come on, man.

302
00:19:35,321 --> 00:19:37,181
照他说的做吧
Just do it.

303
00:19:37,671 --> 00:19:39,591
至少这样你有活下来的机会 是吧?
This way at least you've got a chance, okay?

304
00:19:39,591 --> 00:19:41,101
做吧
Do it.

305
00:19:42,451 --> 00:19:44,661
加油!
Come on!

306
00:19:46,511 --> 00:19:47,751
如果你不做
If you're not gonna do it,

307
00:19:47,751 --> 00:19:49,671
让我们来
we will.

308
00:20:07,451 --> 00:20:09,621
中彩了
We have a winner.

309
00:20:10,601 --> 00:20:12,771
这场好戏 为了这个新来的家伙上演
Let's hear it for the new guy.

310
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:24,411
我们正在见证着成果
We're now seeing concrete results.

311
00:20:24,901 --> 00:20:28,201
这条路我们会继续走下去
This is a road we will continue to travel.

312
00:20:35,217 --> 00:20:39,087
我找到了另一个路口拍下的图 肯定是那辆车
I got a shot coming in from a camera at the next intersection definitely the same truck.

313
00:20:39,087 --> 00:20:40,637
能看到牌照吗?
Can you read the license plate?

314
00:20:40,777 --> 00:20:43,627
没下载完 还看不到
We won't be able to read anything until it finishes downloading.

315
00:20:45,367 --> 00:20:48,127
我通过系统看到了鉴证科对你父亲
I just saw the IAD inquiry coming over the system

316
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,517
在监狱所做之事的调查
about what you're father's doing at the prison.

317
00:20:50,637 --> 00:20:53,487
他们正在质疑你为他做的那份转移令
They're questioning the transfer you generated for him.

318
00:20:54,147 --> 00:20:55,527
知道了
I heard.

319
00:20:56,157 --> 00:21:00,337
如果你需要我证明 你并不知道他要劫走Salazar
If you want me to say that you didn't know he was gonna use it to break out Salazar

320
00:21:00,337 --> 00:21:01,967
我会的
I will.

321
00:21:03,047 --> 00:21:05,147
谢谢 我没事
Thanks. I'll be okay.

322
00:21:07,337 --> 00:21:11,107
等等 停止下载了 显示错误信息
Hold on. It stopped downloading, I'm getting an error message.

323
00:21:12,207 --> 00:21:14,757
错误402...
Error 402 that...

324
00:21:14,897 --> 00:21:17,287
说明内部路由器出了问题
means trouble with the internal router.

325
00:21:45,867 --> 00:21:47,087
你在干嘛?
What are you doing?

326
00:21:47,087 --> 00:21:49,397
有一个路由器出了问题
There's a problem with one of the routers.

327
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:51,217
我正在修理
I'm trying to fix it.

328
00:21:51,337 --> 00:21:52,907
你为什么不找技术部
Why don't you call Tech.

329
00:21:52,917 --> 00:21:54,577
不用 我能搞定
No, it's okay.

330
00:21:54,707 --> 00:21:56,487
我想我找到了故障原因
I think I found the problem.

331
00:21:56,597 --> 00:21:58,137
有一条线路断了
Checks on circuit kicked in.

332
00:21:58,137 --> 00:22:00,097
肯定是其中一根电压猛增
Must have been one of the line surge.

333
00:22:01,937 --> 00:22:03,737
现在能用了
Should be up and running now.

334
00:22:04,487 --> 00:22:06,567
有问题来找我
Let me know if you have any more problems.

335
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:08,127
好
I will.

336
00:22:17,447 --> 00:22:19,017
又可以用了 出了什么问题?
Hey, it's back up. What was it?

337
00:22:19,017 --> 00:22:20,297
不清楚
I'm not sure.

338
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,897
可能是某条线路电压猛增 让路由器短路了?
Is it possible a line surge could have knocked out a router?

339
00:22:22,897 --> 00:22:24,737
不是我造成的 可以问问Chloe?
Well not from my side, you can ask Chloe?

340
00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:32,667
找到了
Got it.

341
00:22:34,617 --> 00:22:35,627

343
00:22:36,817 --> 00:22:38,257
Michelle 我们查到了车牌
Michelle, I've got a plate on the pick up.

344
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:39,777
很好 最后发现它的地点在哪儿?
Good, where do you last have it?

345
00:22:39,787 --> 00:22:43,157
在圣达菲Springs的北部拍到的 正往西方向开去
The shots on the north part of Santa Fe Springs, it was driving west.

346
00:22:43,157 --> 00:22:45,527
好 把它发给警局 让他们去找
Okay, I want you to put this out to mobile units LAPD.

347
00:22:45,527 --> 00:22:47,207
务必全力找到这辆车
I want everyone looking for this vehicle.

348
00:22:47,207 --> 00:22:48,417
好的
Okay, right.

349
00:22:50,407 --> 00:22:51,777
好 Ryan 继续说
Alright, Ryan, I'm back.

350
00:22:51,777 --> 00:22:56,027
你认为Bauer劫走Salazar是他一个人干的
So do you have any idea if Bauer is trying to break out Salazar on his own

351
00:22:56,027 --> 00:22:57,877
还是有同伙?
or if he is working with someone?

352
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,737
我也正在查这个
I'm trying to figure that out now.

353
00:22:59,737 --> 00:23:02,197
- 查到了打给你  - 好的
- I'll get back to you when I found out.  - You do that.

354
00:23:10,467 --> 00:23:11,047
什么事 Michelle?
Yeah, Michelle?

355
00:23:11,047 --> 00:23:12,757
你知道监狱发生的事吗?
Are you following what's going on at the prison?

356
00:23:12,757 --> 00:23:15,207
我刚收到消息 到底发生了什么?
I just saw the update come over. What the hell's happening?

357
00:23:15,207 --> 00:23:17,657
具体情况还不清楚 不过是Jack造成的
We don't have all the details yet but Jack's behind it.

358
00:23:17,657 --> 00:23:20,007
查他的电话和电邮记录
I need you to check his phone logs, e-mail

359
00:23:20,007 --> 00:23:22,357
看他最近调用过的档案文件
See what case files he's accessed recently.

360
00:23:22,487 --> 00:23:23,967
查些什么?
What am I looking for?

361
00:23:23,977 --> 00:23:26,717
任何能帮我们弄清 为什么他这么做的东西
Anything that'll help us figure out why he's doing this.

362
00:23:26,717 --> 00:23:29,467
你确定? 你真的要我去翻他的办公室?
Are you sure? You really want me snooping in his office?

363
00:23:31,207 --> 00:23:32,847
是的
Yes.

364
00:23:33,197 --> 00:23:34,657

Do you know if we get all our feeds from Good Samaritan?

376
00:24:22,747 --> 00:24:24,317

再拿一支镊子?
Do you have another clamp?

386
00:25:17,347 --> 00:25:18,467
镊子
Clamp.

把无线系统调成静音
Radio silence while we're in there.

396
00:26:20,447 --> 00:26:21,817
一旦被听见 他们可能会杀了所有人质

他说的是真的
he's telling you the truth.

406
00:26:53,247 --> 00:26:56,127

I'm a federal agent, I was escorting him out of the prison.

408
00:26:59,027 --> 00:27:00,957
所以你没见过我们
That's why you've never seen us here before.

419
00:28:28,987 --> 00:28:31,047
- 我兄弟不会放过你  - 闭嘴!
- my brother will find you.  - Shut up!

420
00:28:31,797 --> 00:28:33,177
来吧!
Do it!

421
00:28:57,727 --> 00:28:59,347
好了
Alright.

422
00:28:59,347 --> 00:29:00,967
又轮到你了
You're up.

423
00:29:10,567 --> 00:29:13,227
看来你运气到头了 Jack
Looks like your mother's a title, Jack.

424
00:29:36,367 --> 00:29:38,007
Ramon 卧倒!
Ramon, stay down!

425
00:29:49,957 --> 00:29:51,377
快走!
Come on!

426
00:30:04,847 --> 00:30:06,767
安全了! 别开枪!
All clear! Hold your fire!

427
00:30:24,402 --> 00:30:26,402
我没多大成就
I have no triumphs.

428
00:30:26,532 --> 00:30:27,510
只有挫败
Only defeats.

429
00:31:00,672 --> 00:31:02,862
上帝啊!
God!

430
00:31:15,872 --> 00:31:18,022
- 实验室  - 我是Chloe O'Brian
- Lab.  - This is Chloe O'Brian.

431
00:31:18,022 --> 00:31:19,482
我在Jack的办公室
I'm in Jack's office.

432
00:31:19,482 --> 00:31:21,482
请带毒品工具箱上来?
Could you send someone up the drug kit, please?

433
00:31:21,482 --> 00:31:22,802
马上
It's on its way.

434
00:31:26,132 --> 00:31:28,642
事情的区别很明显
The differences on the issues are clear.

435
00:31:29,242 --> 00:31:31,982
但我相信你并没有选择政纲
But I believe you don't elect a platform.

436
00:31:32,502 --> 00:31:34,282
你选择了一个人
You elect a man.

437
00:31:34,722 --> 00:31:35,982
我对总统你
And I am frankly troubled

438
00:31:35,982 --> 00:31:38,762
从私人角度做选择 并会继续从私人角度做选择
by some of the personal choices that this president has made

439
00:31:38,762 --> 00:31:40,832
感到很担忧
and continues to make.

440
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:43,662
我们都知道
We're all aware of the allegations

441
00:31:43,662 --> 00:31:46,602
你前妻受到过指控
and indictments surrounding the President's former wife.

442
00:31:46,612 --> 00:31:49,442
大多数人都相信
Most of us have operated under the assumption

443
00:31:49,452 --> 00:31:52,282
你已有了前车之鉴
that the President will not repeat his history

444
00:31:52,282 --> 00:31:56,132
不会再任用道德上有问题的人
of associating with the persons of questionable moral character.

445
00:31:56,132 --> 00:31:57,752
但是
However,

446
00:31:57,892 --> 00:31:59,942
我的团队刚了解到
my office has just learned

447
00:31:59,942 --> 00:32:03,532
和总统你有瓜葛的一个女人
that the woman with whom the President is currently involved,

448
00:32:03,702 --> 00:32:05,632
Anne Packard医生
Doctor Anne Packard

449
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:10,882
被控蓄意伪造医药检测书
is being accused of helping to fabricate the results of a clinical drug trial.

450
00:32:10,882 --> 00:32:14,392
这种药品夺去了三条无辜的生命
A drug which later led to the deaths of three innocent people.

451
00:32:14,392 --> 00:32:16,062
你这样不道德
This is outrageous.

452
00:32:16,062 --> 00:32:20,142
辩论场不是法院 也不是小报
This debate is not a court of law nor is it a tabloid paper.

453
00:32:20,142 --> 00:32:22,372
你不能在 此时 此地
This is neither the time nor the place

454
00:32:22,372 --> 00:32:24,942
对一个公民发起人身攻击
to launch a personal attack on a private citizen.

455
00:32:24,952 --> 00:32:26,222
总统阁下
Mr. President

456
00:32:26,222 --> 00:32:29,842
参议员还有30秒时间 先生 请继续
the Senator still has 30 more seconds. Sir, please.

457
00:32:29,842 --> 00:32:31,622
现在正是最好的时间
This is exactly the right time.

458
00:32:31,622 --> 00:32:35,102
因为我相信 国家领导人在生活中做出的决定
Because I believe the choices your leaders make in their own lives

459
00:32:35,102 --> 00:32:38,902
影响他代表人民所做出的决定
reflect the choices that they will make on your behalf.

460
00:32:38,902 --> 00:32:40,752
所以我还是要问
And so the question remains.

461
00:32:40,762 --> 00:32:45,242
是总统知晓她的罪状 但选择了视而不见?
Did the President know of these accusations and choose to ignore them?

462
00:32:45,242 --> 00:32:49,592
还是在重复以前犯下的过错?
Or is he repeating past mistakes once again?

463
00:32:50,412 --> 00:32:53,262
总统阁下 请反驳
Mr. President your rebuttal.

464
00:32:54,012 --> 00:32:57,842
我非常自信地告诉大家
I can tell you with complete confidence

465
00:32:57,842 --> 00:33:01,662
参议员的指控 是错误的
that the Senator's accusation is false.

466
00:33:01,762 --> 00:33:06,482
参议员在转移今天应该讨论的辩题
And that I believe it is the Senator's way of aborting the issues at hand.

467
00:33:06,482 --> 00:33:11,192
今晚 我是来讨论我国面临的最紧要问题
Now I came here tonight to discuss the real issues pressing our country.

468
00:33:11,202 --> 00:33:12,472
上帝啊
Oh, god.

469
00:33:12,472 --> 00:33:15,142
- 我认为参议员在...  - 你明白了吧?
- I assume that the Senator was...  - Now do you get it?

470
00:33:15,142 --> 00:33:20,212
我认为此事不应该被忽视或遗忘
I do not believe this is something to be swept under the rug and forgotten.

471
00:33:36,782 --> 00:33:38,652
阳性
It's positive.

472
00:33:41,892 --> 00:33:43,702
我去告诉Michelle
I'll go tell Michelle.

473
00:34:01,282 --> 00:34:03,512
Chloe 你在我爸办公室干嘛?
Chloe, what are you doing in my dad's office?

474
00:34:03,512 --> 00:34:05,602
Michelle让我检查你爸的东西
Michelle wanted me to go through your dad's stuff.

475
00:34:05,902 --> 00:34:07,272
为什么?
Why?

476
00:34:07,482 --> 00:34:10,012
找找能帮我们了解他行为的东西
To find anything that can help us understand what he's doing.

477
00:34:10,012 --> 00:34:11,052
有事吗?
What's up?

478
00:34:11,062 --> 00:34:15,742
你那边会不会电压猛增 导致路由器关闭
I wanted to know if a line surge could shut down a router on your side of the ITS room.

479
00:34:15,742 --> 00:34:18,792
不会 我的电压保护器在楼上 没在我办公室
No, my circuit protectors are upstairs. Not in my ITS.

480
00:34:18,792 --> 00:34:20,072
怎么了?
Why?

481
00:34:20,072 --> 00:34:21,672
应该没什么
Ah, it's probably nothing.

482
00:34:26,372 --> 00:34:28,112
你找到什么没?
Did you find anything?

483
00:34:28,112 --> 00:34:29,862
我不能跟你谈
I can't talk about this.

484
00:34:30,292 --> 00:34:31,722
为什么 我可以帮忙啊
Why not, maybe I can help.

485
00:34:31,722 --> 00:34:33,862
你帮不了 走开 好吗?
You can't help so just go, okay?

486
00:34:36,252 --> 00:34:37,512
箱子里是什么?
What's in the box?

487
00:34:37,512 --> 00:34:39,042
要拿去给Michelle看的东西
Just stuff I'm taking to Michelle.

488
00:34:39,042 --> 00:34:41,522
你这样问很没规矩 Kim
This is really an inappropriate behavior, Kim.

489
00:34:42,302 --> 00:34:44,312
你反应过度了吧 Chloe? 我...
Why are you doing this, Chloe? I mean...

490
00:34:44,322 --> 00:34:45,832
我只是想帮你
I'm just trying to help you.

491
00:34:45,842 --> 00:34:48,682
你帮不了 我没必要在这儿跟你说话
You can't help. And I don't have to have this conversation.

492
00:34:48,682 --> 00:34:50,362
外勤条例中 有一项规定
Under field op mandate, there's a regulation.

493
00:34:50,362 --> 00:34:54,612
40或41条规定 我有管辖特权
I believe it's 40 or 41 that says that I have jurisdictional prerogative.

494
00:34:54,742 --> 00:34:55,992
你快走开吧?
So could you just leave?

495
00:34:55,992 --> 00:34:58,382
除非你告诉我箱子里有什么
Not until you tell me what's in the box.

496
00:35:01,472 --> 00:35:03,872
我认为你爸在吸毒
I think your dad's been using drugs.

497
00:35:03,872 --> 00:35:06,662
- 什么?  - 好吧

501
00:35:16,822 --> 00:35:19,502
他举止怪异 对吗?
He's been acting really weird. Okay?

502
00:35:30,272 --> 00:35:32,652
你真不该逼我这样做
It's really not fair you made me do this.

503
00:35:32,652 --> 00:35:34,452
我很不舒服
It's very uncomfortable.

504
00:35:47,282 --> 00:35:50,692
Jack的文件中没什么发现 不过有东西你得看看
I didn't find anything in Jack's records but there is something you need to see.

505
00:36:04,882 --> 00:36:06,182
你在他办公室发现这个?
You found this in his office?

506
00:36:06,182 --> 00:36:08,622
给你看之前 我得搞清楚这是什么东西
I wanted to make sure what it was before I showed you.

507
00:36:08,622 --> 00:36:11,052
瓶中的液体 做了鸦片测试 阳性
The liquid in these vials tested positive for opiates.

508
00:36:11,062 --> 00:36:12,662
可能是海洛因
Probably heroine.

509
00:36:12,802 --> 00:36:14,512
我觉得Jack在吸毒
I think Jack's a user.

510

找到了
I got it.

511
00:36:19,942 --> 00:36:22,062
巡警发现了载过Kyle Singer的卡车

停在Fuller工业中心 第四区 2000栋
parked in a industrial complex in Fuller and fourth 2000 block.

513
00:36:25,502 --> 00:36:27,652
马上通知队伍待命
Pipe these into the teams on standby.

514
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:31,762
就当那里的每个人都有传染性 设为一级传染状态
Assume everyone on the site is contagious and use level 1 CDC protocol.

515
00:36:31,852 --> 00:36:33,192
找到他!
Let's get him!

516
00:36:54,382 --> 00:36:55,852
见鬼!
Damn!

517
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,312
还有别的出口吗?
Is there any other way out?

518
00:36:57,312 --> 00:36:58,632
没有 我们被锁在里面了
No, we're pinned in.

519
00:36:58,642 --> 00:37:00,262
我们应该料到这些情况
We must have known this could happen.

520
00:37:00,402 --> 00:37:02,242
该怎么办 Jack?
What's the plan, Jack?

521
00:37:06,832 --> 00:37:08,522
把枪给我
Give me the shotgun.

脱下制服
Take off your uniform.

524
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:34,552
去年我和我的内阁 致力于一个总体的学术规划
I have worked the past year with my administration on my overall academic plan.

525
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:37,082
效果不怎么好
The projection could not look better.

526
00:37:38,682 --> 00:37:40,602

530
00:37:46,392 --> 00:37:47,292

好
Okay.

536
00:38:17,426 --> 00:38:18,956
怎么了?
What's the matter?

537
00:38:19,286 --> 00:38:20,896
我没事

我们搜了整个区 没发现Jack和Salazar
We just swept these blocks. There's no sign of Jack or Salazar.

539
00:38:39,876 --> 00:38:41,046
我在冲击区安排了一只小队

540
00:38:41,046 --> 00:38:42,796
封锁区域后 他们才能进行正常搜索
They can't do a proper search until we lock it down.

541

那要花掉半小时
That can take up to a half hour.

542
00:38:46,776 --> 00:38:48,356
如果你想逃脱

一切都照我说的做
And do everything that I tell you.

545
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:53,666
明白吗?
You understand?

546
00:38:53,796 --> 00:38:55,346
好吧
Alright.

- What are you doing, Jack?  - You get these people to move back.

550
00:39:07,246 --> 00:39:08,836
不然你就把我放倒
Or you're gonna have to take me out.

551
00:39:08,836 --> 00:39:10,226
我们要那架直升飞机
We need that chopper.

552
00:39:10,226 --> 00:39:11,296
别这样
Don't do this.

00:39:11,296 --> 00:39:12,946
我和Michelle谈过了
I just spoke with Michelle,

554

我们马上就找到Kyle Singer了
we're close to getting Kyle Singer.

555
00:39:14,736 --> 00:39:16,516
这次马上起不了作用
Close ain't gonna cut it this time.
