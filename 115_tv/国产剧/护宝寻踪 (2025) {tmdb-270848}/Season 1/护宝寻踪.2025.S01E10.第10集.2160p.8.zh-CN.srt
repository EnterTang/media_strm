Which is why we're here.
这就是为什么要我们帮忙

8
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,380
We're either going to authenticate the finest set

9
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:17,130
of human remains from the iron age ever found,

10
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,100
or dash the hopes of a thousand scholars.

您不参加吗?

X-rays. Pictures.
拍X光，照片

18
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,240
We're gonna do this without touching the actual skeleton as much as possible.
我们要尽可能的不去碰到尸骨

19
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,420
Kid gloves?
要戴套么?

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,450
Latex should be all right.
用乳液就可以了

21
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,240
Zack,were you being metaphoric?
Zack你在打什么暗喻吗?

22
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,670
I decided to give it a shot.
我只是决定试试

23
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,730
Which is also metaphoric.
也是个比喻

24
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,510
I need a receptionist.
我需要一个接待员

25
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,430
I can't have just anybody waltzing in here.

26
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,230
Take a look at this.
看看这个

27
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,440
A bunch of red circles?
一组红色圆圈?

28
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,280
Each circle shows where a body part was found.
每个圆圈标示了遗骸的发现地点

29
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,020
- What is this,an airport? - Los angeles international.
- 这是什么地方，飞机场? - 洛杉矶国际机场

30
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,850
Local pathologist says the remains are in pretty bad shape.
当地法医说尸体腐烂得相当糟糕

31
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,420
So he punted to the fbi.

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,270
Airports,they fall under federal jurisdiction.
机场说这归联邦管辖

33
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,280
Excellent use of the word "punt."
"踢球"这个说法用得真棒

34
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,830
I can't go to los angeles, I have an iron age warrior to authenticate.
我不能去洛杉矶 我有一具铁器时代的武士尸体要鉴定

1,500 years ago.

37
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,120
No. Fresh body bits,just a little bit more urgent.
不，新的尸体比较要紧

38
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,030
You do realize there are lot more fresh bodies
你了不了解新的尸体

39
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,230
than there are perfect specimens from the iron age?
比铁器时代的样品要多得多?

40
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,610
And when you say things like that, it's just to bug me,right?
你每次这么说只是想损我, 对吧

41
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,470
Do we have to go through this every time?
每次我们都必须这么做吗?

42
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:35,500
Exactly.
当然

43
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,210
Booth can't just walk in and say,
Booth不能随便走进来然后说

44
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,530

- "打包 我们去L.A." - 哦，好吧好吧，又是冰川时代的战士

- Iron age. - Iron age.
- 铁器时代 - 铁器时代

46
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,000
And that's not the only thing.
并不仅仅因为这件事

47
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,980
Homeland security has just asked dr. Brennan to identify three bodies found in...
国家安全局刚刚要求Brennan博士 去鉴定三具尸体，是在...

48
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,030
- I'm not allowed to say. - The point is,agent booth,
- 我不能说 - Booth探员, 问题的关键在于

49
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,320
dr. Brennan is in great demand on several very pressing cases
Brennan博士实在是事务繁忙

50
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,010
and she's needed here at the museum.

52
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,290
Sexy case in hollywood?
好莱坞的性犯罪案子?

53
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,580
How much more good press could the jeffersonian get?

54
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,550
But,dr. Goodman?
可是, Goodman博士

55
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,440
You said the iron age warrior was of the highest priority.
你说这铁器时代的武士是最重要的

56
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,460
I can step in on that case.
我可以接那个案子

57
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,320
You pack your bags.
你收拾好你的行李

58
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,360
This car doesn't feel very fbi-ey.
这部车没有一点FBI的样子

59
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,180
Hey,bones,this is a 1966 mustang. It's a classic.
嗨, Bones, 这是66年的野马, 是最棒的

60
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,040

我是说还有什么更适合FBI的探员?

61
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,570
How come on the rental agreement under "model" you made the guy write "sedan"?
那你为什么在租赁合同的类型一栏 写箱式货车?

62
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,600
Come on. We're california.
得了, 我们这是在加洲

63
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,110
Look,palm trees.

00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,620
Yeah,I'd like to drive sometime.

- 得了, "雨人" - 说什么呢

68
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,430
Well,I'm always going to drive. You know that,right?
好了, 一向是我开车, 你知道的, 对吧?

Me behind the wheel,and you over there on the grandma side.
我开车的时候, 你还在祖母身边撒娇呢

70
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:57,540
I'm not above telling deputy director cullen what kind of car you rented.
那么我就告诉你上司Cullen你租了什么车

71
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,530
Do you want us to do something, or just stand here and watch?
你需要我们做点什么 还是仅仅站在这儿旁观?

72
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,390
I'm getting a feel for the fellow.
我正在寻找接下来的灵感

73
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,510
- A feel? - Well,there's no bugs on him,
- 灵感? - 恩, 在他的身上并没有虫子

74
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,510
haven't been for over a thousand years.
不像是过了上千年的样子

75
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,590
There may be spores and pollens,correct?
这儿也许有孢子或是花粉, 对吗?

76
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,410
Probably not.
恐怕没有

77
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,520
Dozens of species of pollens have been discovered from the cretaceous era--

78
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,550

65 million years.

That was a pretty good comeback.

00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,740
When authenticating a find like this, we have to be at the top of our game.
每次鉴定这种出土物, 我们必须掌控一切

82
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,490
Yeah,well,we all know that you're gonna say, "I am unable to authenticate with confidence."
行了, 我们都知道你要说 "我不能仅凭信心来做判定"

83
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,340
- Why would he do that? - When you declare something authentic,
- 何出此言？ - 当你想证明某事的时候

84
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,390
you run the risk of being proven wrong.
你会冒着被证实是错误的危险

85
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,230
That doesn't happen if you equivocate.
当然如果你说话模棱两可就不会了

86
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,260
As head of the jeffersonian,

dr. Goodman will place the reputation of the institution over everything else.

90
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,420

恕我直言

91
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,080
you used to be an archaeologist.
您仅仅曾经是一名考古学者

92
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:05,380
I... have no idea what's going on between you two right now.
我不知道你们之间刚才到底是怎么了

93
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,800
Agent finn,why was the body removed from the crime scene?
Finn探员, 为什么尸体被从罪案现场移开?

94
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,360
Call me tricia, dr. Brennan.
叫我Tricia, Brennan博士

95
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,960
The body was removed because parts were visible to arriving flights.
尸体被移开 是因为在航班到来时会被看到

96
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,370
Here's a map of the crime scene with a legend.
这是一张罪案现场的示意地图

97
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,730
Now,there's a marked cone at the location of each body part,
在发现每一个尸体的地方都作了标记

98
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,050
and each photograph corresponds to a cone.
每个记号都有一张现场照片对应

99
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,390
That's how they did it in your book.
这就是他们在你书上做的

100
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,570
She got that from me.
是我教她的

101
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,390
This is not a dismemberment.
这不是人为肢解的

102
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,670
Are you sure,bones? I mean,this is los angeles,you know? They're showy.
你确定吗, Bones? 我是说,这是在洛杉矶 知道吗? 他们疯狂得很

103
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,250
Is it possible that the body parts were ground up in a landing gear
有没有可能性 是被飞机起落架齿轮绞碎的?

104
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,930
and then dumped when the airplane landed?
然后在飞机着陆时落在了这里

105
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,150
The dispersal rate is wrong.
分布不对

106
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,010
It looks to me like the body was pulled apart by... a pack of dogs.
在我看来尸体是被一群狗撕碎的

107
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,820
- More likely,coyotes. - Coyotes at the airport?
- 更像是土狼 - 机场有土狼吗?

108
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,830
- We've got coyotes everywhere. - Did you know that?
- 到处都有 - 你知道吗?

109
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,640
No,I thought coyotes were,you know,a cowboy thing.

I'd like to see the remains now.
我想马上看看尸体

sent back to the jeffersonian immediately.
马上送回Jeffersonian

113

你知道我喜欢什么吗? 没有肉的骨头

114
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,380
Just a personal preference.

115
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,750
There's not much left,anyway.
但是这里的确没有多少肉

116
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,440
You know,dr. Brennan,

as a screenplay writer myself,
作为一个电影编剧

119
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,500

120
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,450
Someone told me they're thinking of making your book into a movie.
有人告诉我他们在考虑把你的书拍成电影

121
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,790
Say something,bones.
是这样吗，Bones

122
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,490

我知道的只是当我在这时 我应该和一些大牌制作人见面

123
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,430
if I have time, which I probably won'T.
如果我有时间的话, 但恐怕是不可能的

124
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:27,130
Does the pathologist need any further access to the remaining soft tissue?
法医需要更多软组织来分析吗?

125
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,520
No. He got everything out of it he could.
不需要，他拿了他能拿的所有东西

126
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,170
So my own screenplay is about this fbi agent

127
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,340
who finds herself on the trail of a former boyfriend,and...

129
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,390

and having the face ripped off by you?

- 什么事? - 在某种程度上, 他太理论化了

It sounds like he's making stuff up.
听起来他在纸上谈兵

It's hard to explain,but it's going to irritate hodgins.

This is a pict.

396

Picti actually means "painted ones" in latin.

397
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:51,710
The romans feared them.

398
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,920
Very little was written about them or by them.

他是个皮克特人, 那有如何？

A pict can't go for a walk?

These remains represent an archaeological anomaly.

406
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,050
This is unique in that no pict has ever been found in this area before.
是因为皮克特人 从来没有在这个地区被发现过

407
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,400
If we can remove the clothing and take a closer look at the bones...

这是放大了十倍的受害人下颚外科手术图

418
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,180
Kostov doesn't do work this sophisticated.

Meaning she had more than one plastic surgeon.

the edges of the bone are almost scalloped,

as if the blade simultaneously cut and applied torsion.

and sanctioned by the american medical association.

428
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,010
It won't help us to discover the identity of our victim,

429
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,600
but it might help us catch her killer.

A fingernail-- probably her own.

I sent it to the fbi crime lab so they could run dna tests.
我把这个送到FBI罪案实验室 以便他们进行DNA测试

441
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,910

顺便说一句, 那是锆, 不是钻石

442
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:55,580
