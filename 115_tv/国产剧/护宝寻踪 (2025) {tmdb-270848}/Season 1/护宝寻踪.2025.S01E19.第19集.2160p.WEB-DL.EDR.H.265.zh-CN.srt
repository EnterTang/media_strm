265

There are a lot of misunderstandings about voodoo.

我想那天晚上他请我去吃晚饭 或者喝什么东西, 记不清了

You know what?Maybe he roofied you.
你知道吗? 也许他给你下了迷药

280
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:31,790
I'm sure he bought the black gum root to look into its medicinal qualities.
我肯定他买黑胶鸡脚 是为了研究它的医理作用

281

Yeah,because we all know how effective that is.

Voodoo healing is quite effective.

283

No crazier than acupuncture or exorcism.

Graham purchased a rare ingredient at a voodoo shop on pontchartrain ave.
Graham在Pontchartrain大街的一家 伏都商店购买了一种很罕见的成分

If you're done with us,detective,we're going to go.
如果你问完了, 侦探, 我们要走了

320
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,830
I'm going to tear this place apart,
我会把这个地方掀个底朝天

I will take you into custody.

But I sure as hell think someone can fake amnesia.

你们怎么会觉得这个工作 会和Graham被杀有关?

Bones has voodoo amnesia;legiere is voodoo-dead;
Bones有伏都失忆症 Legiere是被伏都咒杀死的

334
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,250

而他们最后一起工作的 是一个伏都仪式的谋杀者

335
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,910
so I'm thinking there might be some kind of a connection.
所以我以为这里面可能会有什么联系

336
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,950
Legiere's body--

You know,"vacation"--it's from the latin,vacatio.
你知道吗, "度假(vacation)"  它来自拉丁语, vacatio

意思是 "自由" 或者 "释放" 也许你下次该想想这个

351
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,310
Learning latin?
学拉丁语?

352
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,070
This is the opposite of vacation.
这就像是度假的反义词

353
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:43,700
I mean,the one that you snapped,went insane and totally lost your mind.
我的意思是, 这个你突然中断 变得神经兮兮而且让你脑子完全失灵的假期

我试过去做一个数字正片, 但是不起作用

365
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,710
Why? --It was voodoo,probably.
- 为什么?  - 也许是伏都

366
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:26,970
The extrapolation protocols can't resolve the gradient fluxes in the bone shadings.
推算协议无法解决骨阴影的梯度流量

367
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,650

Can you send the actual remains?

372
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,600
They don't exist.

373
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:37,890
That makes no sense.
没道理啊

374
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,490
It was probably voodoo.
可能是伏都

375
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,460
Voodoo?
伏都?

376
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,250
Okay,quit saying "voodoo."
好了, 别再说 "伏都" 了

377
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:44,860

行, 找到什么就告诉我们, 拜

380
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,950
Those spells are the work of a sorcerer.
那些是一个男巫士的符咒

381
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,520
Priests-- houngans--can make healing motions mojoes,but I'm not allowed.
牧师--祭师--可以做治疗, 但是我不能

382
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,270
But snake shaking-- that's fine?
但是摇蛇--那就可以?

383
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:02,860
The snake pulls the evil out of the soul,freeing the spirit...
蛇把灵魂里的恶魔拖出来, 解放灵魂...

384
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,640
I must do what small things I can.

385
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:07,200
The floods washed away too much of what was good.

Hey,bones,how's about while you're a murder suspect,
嗨, Bones, 你现在可是杀人嫌疑犯

Bye. Good snake.Bye-bye.
拜, 乖蛇, 再见

389
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:21,980
You know,call me crazy,but I'm suspicious of snake man.
你可以, 说我疯了 但是我怀疑那个耍蛇人

390
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,170
Oh! That's because you've been inculcated by 
哦! 那是因为你被

391
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:27,240
the mainstream culture's prevailing judeo-christian tradition 
主流文化中流行的犹太与基督教所共有的 传统教导长大的

392
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,830
into instinctive skepticism of alternative mores.
变得本能地会对二者之外的 其他产生怀疑

393
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:34,170
Yeah. Thanks for that explanation.
是啊, 谢谢你的解释

394
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,830
I've been over every inch of these x-rays.
我已经仔细看过这些X光片了

395
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,930
Me,too.
我也是

396
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,660
There's evidence of particles on the bones,
骨头里有很细小的痕迹

397
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,860
but there is no way for me to know what they are.
但是我根本不知道那是什么

398
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,490
Probably dirt.
也许是灰尘

399
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,220
Yes,thank you,zack,
是的, 谢谢, Zack

400
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,310
but dirt is a meaningless word.
但是灰尘是废话

401
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,780
You can't see air on an x-ray.
你在X光片看不到空气

402
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:54,590
What?
什么?

403
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:55,810
I never said you could.
我从没说过你可以

404
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,880
What? I'm not even talking about air.
什么?我都没说起空气

405
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,430
You can see a space where air might be,
你可以看到空气所在的空间

406
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,580
like a cavity,but not the air itself.
像是一个腔, 但是不是空气本身

407
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,080
What I'm saying is that,yes,
我正在说的是, 是的

408
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:07,900
there are flecks on the x-ray that might be dirt,
在X光片下的斑点可能是灰尘

409
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,460
but that doesn't tell us anything.
但是那说明不了什么

410
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,880
Is it sandy,hmm?
是沙子吗, 恩?

411
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,010
Silty,humusy?
淤泥, 腐殖质?

412
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:15,270
Is it clay? Is it more organic than mineral?
那是粘土吗? 是比矿物质 更有活性的物质吗?

413
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,270
Is it soil? Is it pulverized gravel?
是土壤吗? 是砂砾粉吗?

414
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,200
What minerals are in it? Are the minerals crystalline?
它的成分是什么?  那矿物是晶体状的吗?

415
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,720
See,these are all details a person cannot get off an x-ray
看吧, 这些是一个人不能找到的细节

416
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,160
no matter how long he stares at it.
不管他盯着X光片看多久

417
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,530
Sometimes a person should look for things that aren't there
有时候一个人应该去找找不在的东西

418
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,240
instead of things that are there.
而不是只停留在表面

419
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,650
You mean me?
你说我吗?

420
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,670
In dirt?
只看到灰尘?

421
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,500
No. Me.
不, 是我

422
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:36,350
On the x-ray. I've been looking for anomalies which exist
看X光片 我一直在找存在的不寻常东西

423
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,660
instead of anomalies which don't exist.
而不是不存在的异常物

424
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:39,900
Zack,
Zack

425
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:43,380
if you are ever going to successfully mimic being human,
如果你曾想过要成功地做人的话

426
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:48,390
you have to stop making everything about you,and feign interest in the other guy.
你就得停止让一切都围着你转 然后假装对他人的事感兴趣

427
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,310
Zack!
Zack!

428
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,740
I've noticed that you try to look taller.
我注意到你想看起来高点

When?

430
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:54,700
Around dr. Brennan.
在Brennan博士身边转的时候

431
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,580
I do not.
我没有

432
00:21:56,670 --> 00:22:00,300
And angela,because they are both taller than you.
还有Angela, 因为她们都比你高

433
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,170
You know what?
你知道吗?

434
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,110
I take it back.
我收回我的话

435
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:04,460
Don't take any interest in the other guy.

Thank you for your help.

你还记起其他什么有帮助的事吗?

438
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,030
It could have been me.
那可能是我

439
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,070
You remember that?
你记起那了?

440

Look at it objectively.
客观地看

Not only do I not have an alibi,I...

454
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,900
Let's just be wildly emotional and assume
大胆地假定

it's another voodoo dumpling?

Just once in your life will you be quiet?
