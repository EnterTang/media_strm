00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,100
但你不知道我还有一招
Except you're forgettingthere's one thing I can do now.

135
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,350
这个 或者是神经反射的问题
It's either thator a reflex response or--

136
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,710
怎么了?
what happened?

137
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:57,810
好吧
Okay.

138
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,070
这是House医生
This is dr.House.

139
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,710
- House 这位是Caren - 荣幸之至 怎么了?
-House, this is caren. -Pleasure's all mine.What happened?

140
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,520
当我们插入导电针 她抖动了
When we insertedthe conduction pin,she flinched.

141
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,680
她动了! 听见了?
She flinched!Did you hear?

142
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,870
是不是意味着好转了
Does that mean I'm getting better?

143
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,130
抖了多大一下
How big is a flinch?

144
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,470
比抽动大 比痉挛小?
Bigger than a twitch?Smaller than a spasm?

145
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:15,130
你抽烟吗?
You smoke?

146
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,600
应酬型的 抽的不多
Socially.Not a lot.

147
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,280
你做瑜珈 还抽烟?
You do yogaand you smoke?

148
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,710
我知道 我是两面人
I know.It's hypocritical.

149
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,380
没关系 大家都在看你的腿
Not at all.The world sees your legs.

150
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,470
没人检查你的肺
No one's checking out your lungs.

151
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,620
- 吸烟怎么会导致... - 不会
-How would smoking-- -it wouldn'T.

152
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,930
我只是找火机
I just needed a lighter.

153
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,040
House!
House!

154
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,140
我的天
Oh, my god!

155
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,860
症状很像那么回事
The case was lookingso promising.

156
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,010
我不是假装的
Hey, I'm not faking.

157
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,310
你动了 说明你没瘫
You moved.Therefore, you can move.

158
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,310
趁早把这个疯子弄出去吧
Get this lunaticout of here before she bores again.

159
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,440
我不是假装的
I'm not faking!

160
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:13,410
我听说你刚才跟病人家属一起看手术
I heard youwere watching surgery with a patient's family.

161
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,660
还跟病人家属谈话了
Talking to a patient's family.

162
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:22,230
是你的幻觉影响了你吧? 被枪击后的阴影
It's because of yourhallucination, isn't it?After you were shot.

163
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,810
你重新选择生活 选你想要的生活
You chose life.You decidedyou wanted meaning.

164
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,300
所以你挑了个没什么挑战性的病例
So you took a casewith no mystery.

165
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,590
任何医生都会治的那种
Something any doctor could do.

166
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:35,900
除了可以治好那个病人 这病例并没有什么突破性
A case with no upside except the satisfaction of helpinganother human being.

167
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,080
她感谢我
She thanked me.

168
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,450
但是 你感觉不到什么
And...you felt nothing.

169
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,450
我也不知道应该有什么感觉
I wasn't even surewhat I was supposed to feel.

170
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,850
这就跟你的腿一样 它萎缩了
It's like your leg.It's atrophied.

171
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:53,380
多试几次 感觉就回找回来的
Keep working it.The feeling will come.

172
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,420
不好意思
Sorry.

173
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,870
还是要你来
Need you.Again.

174
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,100
我说了赶她走
I told youto get rid of her.

175
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,800
还好没赶走 她胸部受到压迫
It's a good thing we didn'T.Tightness in her chest.

176
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,620
呼吸困难 可能有胸膜渗出液
She can't breathe.It could bea pleural effusion.

177
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,410
恩
Right.

178
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:04,360
不然的话她就是故意像小朋友一样屏气
Either thator she's holding her breath like a four-year-old.

179
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:16,460
放松点
RelaX.

180
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,300
我不会再烧你了
I'm not gonnaburn you again.

181
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,530
我要戳你!
I'm going to stab you!

182
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:31,910
听着 如果你不是假装的话 就是有胸膜渗出液了
Look, either you're faking or you've gota pleural effusion.

183
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,500
是由肺周围的体液形成的 这很严重
That's a buildup of fluidaround the lungs,which is very serious,

184
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:38,930
我只能用这个针头戳进你的背 把它们吸出来
and I'd have no choice but to stab you in the backwith this needle and suck all the fluidout of you.

185
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,930
-所以 - 应该做局麻
-So. -we should give her a local.

186
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,870
那跟我恶劣的形象就不相符了
That would defeat the pointof me being nasty.

187
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,570
准备好了?
Ready?

188
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,750
-躺下 -她躺下就不能呼吸了
-Down. -She can't breathe if she's down.

189
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,700
-躺下 -她不能...
-Down. -She can't--

190
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:02,480
快 快 快!让她躺下!
down, down, down!Come on!

191
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,090
那不是胸膜渗出液
That's nota pleural effusion.

192
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,320
是她心脏有问题
The problem's in her heart.

193
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,280
这是装不出来的
Can't fake that.

194
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:30,190
过去两小时我已经三次给她减压了
I've had to relievethe pressure three times In the last two hours.

195
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:33,510
要么我们就查清楚心脏周围出血的原因
So either we figure out what's causing blood to build uparound her heart,

196
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:36,160
要么我就拿着针头追着她整个下半辈子
or I follow her aroundwith a needle for the rest of her life.

197
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,270
没有心脏杂音 也没有器质性病变
Echo was clean.No structural abnormalities.

198
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,520
可能是个感染的过程 比如结核
Could be aninfectious process, tb.

199
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,570
或者系统性血管炎 这可以解释渗出液
Or vasculitis would alsoplain the effusion.

200
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,260
但是不能解释她双脚的瘫痪
but not the paralysis.

201
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,650
我们假设她不是装的
Let's assumethat she wasn't faking it.

202
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,570
她动了 就是说 她可以活动
she moved.Therefore, she could move.

203
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,740
她没有瘫痪
She wasn't paralyzed.

204
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,950
那不一定是装的 可能是一种错觉
Doesn't mean she was faking.Could have been a delusion.

205
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,610
也可能她是装的
Either she was faking

206
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:00,260
碰巧她有心脏病 在同一时间发作 或者仍然是错觉
and coincidentallygot a real cardiac problem at the exact same time, or it's a delusion.

207
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,570
这种瘫痪的假象是种神经学症状
And the fake paralysisis a real neurological symptom.

208
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,690
你认为她脊柱里有血管瘤?
You thinking vascular tumorin her spine?

209
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,750
她的血小板数正常
Her platelets are normal.

210
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,860
她全身上下都扫描过了 没发现什么
And she's been scannedup and down.It was all clean.

211
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,240
那就打开她身体去找
So open her up and find it.

212
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,910
你想让我们做什么?
so what do you want us to do?

213
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,680
从颈部开始一节节脊椎找 直到发现异物?
Start at her neck and just keep cuttingdown her spine until we stumble on something?

214
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,210
应该行得通的
That should work.

215
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,360
心率偏高
His heart rate'sa little high.

216
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,380
很严重吗?
Should I be worried?

217
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,990
可能他只是还没有从手术从恢复过来
Probably just meanshe's still in discomfort from the surgery.

218
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,040
我会调高他的吗啡用量
I'm gonna up his morphinea little.

219
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,800
你对我们真好
You've been so nice to us.

220
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,700
这是医生该做的
That's the job.

221
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,080
不 我的意思是 其他的医生
No, I mean,all the other doctors,

222
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:43,270
他们只关心病情 治疗方案 损伤情况
all they did was obsess on the cancer, the treatment, the damage.

223
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,680
只是为了救他
Just trying to fix him.

224
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,480
你是第一个真正关心他的生命质量的医生
You're the first doctor that's ever given a damnabout the quality of his life.

225
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,160
他的心率下来了
His heart rate'scome down.

226
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:56,770
吗啡起作用了 我做对了
Morphine worked.I was right.

227
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,960
真是感人的一幕
What a touching moment.

228
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,980
这就是我们做医生的原因
That's whywe become doctors.

229
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,750
一个这样的场面就能让我们倍感温暖
One of those rare momentswhen our hearts are warmed--

230
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,980
想喝点什么吗?
would you liketo get a drink?

231
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,980
你是说真的 还是只想换个话题?
Are you serious, or are you just tryingto change the subject?

232
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,140
不是 我说真的
No, I'm serious.

233
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,920
我喝 你也喝
I drink.You drink.

234
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,060
我们可以一起喝
We could do itat the same time.

235
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,310
坐同一张桌子
At the same table.

236
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,590
想吃点什么吗?
Do you eat?

237
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,010
我们也可以一起进餐啊
We could do that, too.

238
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,800
我是说 如果你不想 那也可以 不过...
I mean, if the answer is no, that's cool, but--

239
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,290
不是的 只是...
no, it's just--

240
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,240
你刚做完手术 还没有完全恢复
you're just comingoff the surgery, and you're not yourself yet.

241
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,970
我是你的下属 尽管去年...
And I work for you,and even though last year'S...

242
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:46,420
你在笑 我拒绝你 你却在笑
You're smiling.I'm saying no,and you're smiling.

243
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,000
我可不是针对你
Oh, don't take itpersonally.

244
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,150
而是因为你满嘴的胡说八道
It's just 'causeyou're full of crap.

245
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,220
你根本不想跟我约会
You have no interestin going out with me.

246
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,480
也许你想过...
Maybe you did...

247
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,480
在我不能走的时候
when I couldn't walk.

248
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,430
我是个生病的可怜虫 你可以让我恢复健康
When I was a sick puppy that you could nurtureback to health.

249
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,930
现在我好了 你就没有兴趣了
Now that I'm healthy,there's nothing in it for you.

250
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,590
你并没有好
You are not healY.

251
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,270
Cuddy要见你
Cuddy wants to see you.

252
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:21,560
你才恢复工作24小时就开始在一个女人 的脊柱里玩躲迷藏的把戏了
You've been back at work24 hours, and you're alreadyplaying hide-and-seek in a woman's spine.

253
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,430
谁赌赢了?
Who won the pool?

254
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:24,650
没有发现肿瘤
There's no tumor.

255
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,250
她的血小板数也正常
Her platelets are normal.

256
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,040
- 扫描也没发现... - 情况最坏会怎样?
-The scans didn't-- -what's the worstthat can happen?

257
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,780
我令她瘫痪
I paralyze her.

258
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,300
她甚至都注意不到
She wouldn't even notice.

259
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,900
她的律师会的
Her lawyers might.

260
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,970
这个手术不能做 你另一个病人的吗啡剂量要降下来
You're not doing the surgery.And lower the morphineon your other patient.

261
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,870
好吧 我降 如果你让我坐手术
Fine, I'll lower it.If you'll let me dothe surgery.

262
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,180
什么?
What?

263
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,110
这是做交换?
You want to trade?

264
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:46,170
咱们是农夫吗? 你帮我堆草 我送你山羊?
We're not swappin'a couple of goats for your helpputtin' up a barn.

265
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,760
你有所求 我也有所求
You want something.I want something.

266
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,370
咱们妥协 这是处理冲突的理智方式
We compromise.It's the grownup wayto resolve our differences.

267
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,680
我们对此有成熟的机制
There alreadyis a mechanism for that.

268
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:53,930
叫做上下级关系
It's called the employer-employee relationship.

269
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,930
我可以得到我想要的 你不能
I get what I want,and you don'T.

270
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,590
你想交换?
You tried to swap?

271
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,420
做几项检查
Ran a few more tests.

272
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:18,030
如果没异常就做手术
Came back negative.Surgery's on.

273
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,660
你真的不在乎 是吧?
You really don'tgive a crap, do you?

274
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:30,870
这么说我是坏蛋?
Does that make me evil?

275
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,500
没错
Yeah.

276
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,570
女孩的生命危在旦夕 我们还在谈论...
The girl's lifeis at stake.All we're talking aboutwith the guy is--

277
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:39,510
我们在谈论的是你接下病例的原因
all we're talking aboutis the reason you took the case.To help someone.

278
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,580
- 算他们倒霉 - 算你倒霉
-Too bad for them. -Too bad for you.

279
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:46,000
我们渴望有意义 因为这让我们快乐
The reason we crave meaning is becauseit makes us happy.

280
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,830
快乐的第一个层面是...
The first levelof happiness is--

281
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,090
我不会走开
I'm not going away.

282
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:54,790
快乐的第五个层面是创造
the fifth level of happiness involves creation.

283
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:55,990
改变生活
Changing lives.

284
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:59,720
快乐的第六个层面是海洛因 第七是你走远点
the sixth level is heroin.The seventh level is you going away.

285
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:03,360
你在拯救生命 这几乎等于创造生命
You're saving lives.Which is tantamountto creating lives.

286
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:06,390
但是你只要把它当一个游戏
But all you're takingaway from this is the game.

287
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,810
你不用听别人感谢你
You don't have to listen to them thanking you.

288
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:10,700
你不用改变接病例的习惯 或者诊治的方式
You don't have to change the cases you take or even how you handle them.

289
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,000
只需知道你的努力有成效
You just have to know that you made a difference.

290
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:23,780
House 你不是--
House, you're not--

291
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,120
我可不是傻子
I'm not an idiot.

292
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,380
House 别碰她
house, leave her alone.

293
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,160
把手术停了
close her up.

294
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,070
想知道为什么?
Wanna know why?

295
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,790
手术室不再是无菌的了
The room's no longer sterile.

296
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,770
没错 但那不是最有意思的原因
True, but that's notthe most interesting reason.

297
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,190
那可不是一个性感的大脚趾
That is not a sexy big toe.

298
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,920
你才不会不会把那放进嘴里
You would neverput that in your mouth.

299
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,140
- 那到底是怎么回事-- - 说了有意思
-What the hellhas that got to do with-- -told youit was interesting.

300
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,710
甚至会很有意思
It gets even better.

301
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,390
坏血病?
Scurvy?

302
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,020
嗯 喝吧
Yeah.Drink.

303
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:52,660
出海的水手饮食单调得的病?
Like what sailors getwhen they don't eat right?

304
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,620
是的
Aye-aye.

305
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,230
你的臂部和腿部组织都淤了血
Your arms and leg tissuesare choked with blood.

306
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:59,330
因此你动弹不得 还损坏了你的头发和脚趾甲
Makes it hard to move.Also damages your hairand toenails.

307
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,490
但是我正在节食 大量的蛋白质 大量的--
But I'm on this great diet.Lots of protein, lots of--

308
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,770
没有维生素C
no vitamin C.

309
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:05,630
现在喝了它
Now drink.

310
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:11,170
嗯 谢谢你
Well, thank you.

311
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,290
还要谢谢 House 医生
And thank dr.House.

312
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,200
给他写个纸条吧
Send him a note.

313
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:22,470
护士改变了他的吗啡用量 我想你是担心他--
The nurse changedhis morphine.I thought you wereworried about the--

314
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,760
仅仅是术后不适症状 他可以回家了
it's just post-opdiscomfort.He's ready to go home.

315
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,010
所以他不再会感到疼痛吗?
So he won't haveany pain?

316
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:30,720
最终不会
Eventually.

317
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,420
谢谢你了
Thank you.

318
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,930
别的事也会这样
Everything elsewill be the same.

319
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:39,270
你祛除了他的疼痛 那-- 已经改变了很多
Well, you took away his pain,and that--that changes a lot.

320
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,310
为什么不送他去那些看护中心呢?
Why don't you put himin some sort of facility?

321
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,670
没有泳池的地方
Someplace without a pool.

322
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:56,540
是啊 我可以把他扔在那儿
Yeah, I could dump him there.

323
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:57,740
可是
Except...

324
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,770
他是我的丈夫
he's my husband.

325
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,040
是我儿子的父亲
He's my son's father.

326
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,150
没错
Right.

327
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,920
孩子们需要爸爸
Kids need a dad.

328
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,880
可以互相追着玩 可以一起讨论女孩

329
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,400
Mark 已经明白了不需要抛弃别人--
Mark's learned that you don'thave to abandon someone--

330
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,760
养只小狗吧
get a dog.

331
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,030
我会好好照顾他的 正如你帮了我们
I'm taking care of him for the same reasonyou helped us.

332
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,320
有人朝你开枪了? 你也有幻觉?
Some guy shot you,and you hallucinated?

333
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,320
我有这个责任
I have a responsibility.

334
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:26,270
他是一个沉重的铁锚 会带着你和你家人一起往下坠
So he's just an anchor weighingyou and your family down.

335
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:30,040
消耗你的精力 浪费你的生命 那是你获得的生命意义
Sapping your energy,wasting your life.That's the meaningyou take from this.

336
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,750
我想好好照顾他
I want to take care of him.

337
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,420
你乐在其中
You enjoy this.

338
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,460
我不能抛弃他
I can't abandon him.

339
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,810
所以你本不想照顾他
So you don't wantto take care of him.

340
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:43,940
照顾他不能让你感到满足 让你开心
Taking care of him doesn't fulfill you,make you happy.

341
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,580
但是不照顾他你会很痛苦
But not taking care of himwould make you miserable.

342
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:01,450
好了

我不需要你的帮助 我已经做过无数次了
I don't need your help.I've done thisa million times.

让他背朝下躺下
Lay him back down.

346
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,560
再做一次
Do that again.

347
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,170
发出那个声音
Make that sound.

348
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,050
那是什么?
What was that?

349
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,600
那...
That...

350
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,380
是在说话
was talking.

351
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:51,100
你们这群无能的医生
you guysare lousy doctors.

352
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:54,920
一个个都忙着让病人好受点 却忘了查出到底是什么病因
You're in such a rush to make the patient feel better, you forgot to checkwhat was wrong.

353
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,650
瑜珈女孩2小时前走着离开医院 你治好了她
Yoga girl walked out of heretwo hours ago.You fixed her.

354
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,430
不是她 是别人
Not her.The other guy.

355
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:02,130
他患了脑瘤 8年前切除了
He had brain canceR.They removed iteight years ago.

356
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,000
从那时起他的状况就一直这样
His condition's been the sameever since.

357
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,210
直到昨晚 他说话了
Until last night.He spoke.

358
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,090
他说什么了?
What'd he say?

359
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,840
他...只发出了咕噜声?
He...grunted?

360
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:17,430
你要我们把8年来所有有咕噜症状 的病人仔细研究一遍?
You want us to dissect eight years of medical historywith grunting in the differential?

361
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,200
看来不错 做好了叫我
Sounds good.Call me when you're done.

362
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,520
你很无聊地捏造了一个秘密
You're fabricating a mysterybecause you're bored.

363
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,870
我才不无聊呢
I am not bored.

364
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,620
该死
Damn it.

365
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,410
你不会告诉他妻子那只是个咕噜声吧?
You didn't tell the wifeit was only a grunt?

366
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:36,250
当然不会
Of course not.

367
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,710
否则她就不会同意做一连串危险的检查了
Because then she neverwould have consented to a bunch of dangerous tests.

368
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,720
你几时这么爱管闲事了
I don't remember youbeing this bitchy.

369
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:45,080
维柯丁(止痛药)让你行动迟钝 在白天清醒的光芒下 我是乐趣杀手
The vicodin dulled it.In the sober light of day,I'm a buzz-kill.

370
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:47,550
你给一个可怜的家庭虚假的希望
You're giving false hope to a family that's been wrecked.

371
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,490
别再折磨他们了
Don't torture them.

372
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:51,260
随他去吧 告诉他妻子那只是一声咕噜 让她回家
Let it go.Tell the wifeit was only a grunt.Tell her to go home.

373
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,730
我不能看着她就这么绝望
I can't let her downlike that.

374
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,080
要用多多虚假的希望把她拉上来
Pumped her upwith too much false hope.

375
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:03,550
瞧 我做得多漂亮!
Oh, I stuck that primo!

376
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,030
我真是太出色了!
How rad am I?

377
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,220
2002年 病人患了干眼症
2002, patient had dry eyes.

378
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:32,280
干眼症并发咕噜
Dry eyes plus a grunt.

379
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,500
都可能是病因
It all makes sense.

380
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,620
也可能是神经问题
Could bea neurological issue.

381
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:38,490
我得花粉热 滴眼药水的时候 可不会去找神经科医生
I get hay fever,I put drops in my eyes.I don't goto a neurologist.

382
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:41,550
干眼症可能表明自主性神经官能障碍
Dry eyes could indicatean autonomic dysfunction.

383
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,460
写到白板上
Goes on the board.

384
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,320
会不会是咳嗽?
What about coughing?

385
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:45,290
或者是鼻屎? 不应该把鼻屎也包括进来吗?
Or boogers?Should we include boogers?

386
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,970
我很高兴我们在做这个
I'm happy we're doing this.

387
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,420
比起延长某人的肌腱 我更愿意干这个
I'd much rather do this than lengthensome guy's tendon.

388
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,760
病人的头痛更严重了
Patient's headachesincreased.

389
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,590
医生扫描了他的头部 发现了一个肿瘤
Doc scanned his head,found a tumor.

390
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:55,070
你喜欢浪费你的时间?
You like wasting your time?

391
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,980
- 我正在学 - 学了干什么?
-I'm learning. -To do what?

392
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:00,620
重新考虑已经解决的病例 因为你不想面对现实世界吗?
Reconsider solved cases because you don't want to deal with the real world?

393
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,170
他正在把我们推向死胡同
He's pushingwhere there's nothing.

394
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:04,390
Cameron 你是一名杰出的医生

395
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:07,020
会有许多感激涕零的病人向你泣谢
You'll get lotsof tearful thank-yous from grateful patients.

396
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:09,070
我还没那么渴望感谢
Yeah, am I such a bitchfor wanting that?

397
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,790
得了吧 那又不坏 不过这不是我为什么在这里的原因
Well, it's not a bad thing.But it's not why I'm here.

398
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,650
我得到了这个向 House 学习的机会
I took this fellowshipto learn from house.

399
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:15,340
他在教你怎样成为一个受虐狂
He's teaching youto be a masochist.

400
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,390
把干眼症写上白板
Dry eyes goes on the board.

401
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:26,230
在8年里 记录到214种症状 多种重复出现
in eight years, the patient experienced 214 symptoms, many of them repeating.

402
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,840
有没有什么模式?
Any patterns?

403
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:31,960
发热伴发尿频可能意味着前列腺炎
fever plus frequent urination could mean prostatitis.

404
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,910
或者是尿道感染
Or a urinary tract infection.

405
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,880
- 白细胞计数正常 - 无感染
-White count was normal. -No infection.

406
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,530
如果再加上疼痛 发热
if you add pain into the mix, fever,

407
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,460
尿频可能意味着肾有问题
frequent urination could indicate a kidney problem.

408
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,280
我喜欢这个想法
I like it.

409
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,380
不会的 肌酐和尿素氮都很正常
No.Creatinine and bunwere both normal.

410
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,470
不是说肾 是说疼痛
Not the kidney part.The pain part.

411
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:51,860
腹部疼痛加上那些症状可能就是胰腺囊肿
Abdominal pain plus all that stuff could equal pancreatic cysts.

412
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,790
漂亮 你们成功找出了一个 他从没有过的症状
perfect.You've managed to pick the one symptom he never had.

413
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,150
腹部疼痛
Abdominal pain.

414
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,270
那是白板上的第一个症状 咕噜
It's the first symptomon the board.Grunt.

415
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,670
咕噜又不能确诊为腹部疼痛
Grunting isn't pathognomonic for abdominal pain.

416
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,370
不
No.

417
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:04,790
传统的标志性症状是横膈膜的压缩
The traditionaldiagnostic marker is compression of the diaphragm

418
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,670
和喉部的震动 发出我们能听见的声音
and vibration of the larynx, leading to the audible sound.

419
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,240
"我感到腹部好痛"
"I have a painin my abdomen.

420
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,270
Richard 的症状是从8年的 病例里面精选出来的
"richard's symptoms are culled from eight yearsof medical history.

421
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:16,010
没有模式 这些只是8年间随机的 个体的病例
They're not patterned.These are random, individual events over time.

422
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:18,270
疾病有潜伏期
Illnesses haveincubation periods.

423
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,030
做个上呼吸道超声内镜检查
Do an upper endoscopic ultrasound.

424
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,410
他的咽喉会被毁掉的
his throat will collapse.

425
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,950
他颈部肌肉退化 无法承受这种程度的检查
Muscle degenerationin his neck won't tolerate the scope.

426
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,090
那可是个自动软管
It's an automatic trach.

427
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,970
听你们说他好像是个残疾人
You're talking about himlike he's an invalid.

428
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:28,250
我们没啥感觉
We're insensitive.

429
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,780
他淌口水吗? 他能直起自己的脖子吗?
Does he drool?Can he hold his neck straight?

430
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,330
他吃东西时呛吗?
Does he chokeon his food?

431
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:37,220
他脖子没问题 他的咽喉不会被毁掉的
His neck's fine.His throat'snot gonna collapse.

432
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,170
Cameron 去征得他妻子的同意
Cameron, get consentfrom the wife.

433
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,470
张嘴
Open.

434
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,840
我需要你做吞咽动作
I need you to swallow.

435
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:04,850
抱歉
Sorry about that.

436
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:13,230
开始
Here we go.

437
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,930
经过食道括约肌到达胃腔
Passing through the loweresophageal sphincter, into the antrum of the stomach.

438
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,000
胰腺的后部
There's the tail of the pancreas.

439
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,200
没有病变
Looks clean.

440
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,330
向中间移动 胰腺的中部和头部也无病变
Moving medially,the body and the headof the pancreas look clean--

441
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,040
拿出来
get it out.Get it out.

442
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,360
卡住了 动不了
It's stuck. I can't move it.

443
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,770
他喉咙塌陷了
His throat's collapsed.

444
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,340
心跳呼吸都成问题 情况紧急
Vitals are all overthe place. We're losing him.

445
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,450
切开
I'm cutting.

446
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,430
插入导管 用内窥镜法移出了探针 他才恢复呼吸
We trached him,endoscopicallyremoved the probe, and he's breathing again.

447
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:57,320
总体来说 好主意
So,all in all,great idea.

448
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,530
在世界末日前观察到胰腺了吗?
Did you get a lookat the pancreas before the world ended?

449
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:00,470
没有病变
It was clean.

450
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:04,230
说明除非你阻拦 他明天就能出院
Which means,barring anything else, meaning you,he can go home tomorrow.

451
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,500
他差点死了 怎么能放他走?
This man nearly died. How can you discharge him?

452
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,720
我们的预测导致他喉咙塌陷
His throat collapsed becauseof what we predicted.

453
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,170
戳喉咙 肌肉会收缩 这是痉挛
you stick something down someone's throat, they gag.Spasm.

454
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:15,220
他就是如此 用了半小时才取出探针
Which he did. It took us a half an hourto get that thing out.

455
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,570
除非病人的喉咙被镇静了
Except our patient's throatwas sedated.

456
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,530
大脑应该发送信号不做出反应
Which means the brainshould have sent a signal in not to do anything.

457
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:24,650
可能会是癌症
This could be cancer.

458
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:27,810
或是异常的神经退化 甚至是新型--
Or some bizarre neurodegeneration. Even a new typeof vacular--

459
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,080
别说了
stop it.

460
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,530
你乐在其中
You're enjoying this.

461
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,480
我觉得有趣
I find it interesting.

462
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,220
你是对的 这才有趣 如果你错了 这么折磨他就只是取悦你
It's interestingonly if you're right. If you're wrong,we're torturing this guy to amuse you.

463
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,700
半小时取出探针?
Half hourto remove the probe?

464
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:44,440
House
House.

465
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,630
这不是痉挛
It's not a spasm.

466
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,940
他的喉咙不是塌陷 而是紧锁了
His throat didn't collapse. It locked down.

467
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:53,700
大脑协调身体的每块肌肉同时舒张或收缩
Brain is supposed to tell every muscle in the body to relax and contract at the same time.

468
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,180
这块肌肉只是收缩 说明有一个大脑信号没有传送到
This muscle was onlycontracting,which means a signal from thebrain was not getting through.

469
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:00,090
他大脑没有损伤 不会干扰指令
there are no lesions  his brain. Nothing to interruptany orders.

470
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,560
一根电路坏损就能导致
All it takes is one wire down.

471
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,250
没有证据哪根电路坏了
You have no evidenceof any wires down.

472
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:06,730
脑膜中有微小肿瘤 瞬时就窒息而死
A few microtumorson the meninges, suddenly you're chokingto death.

473
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:10,260
你要查看他大脑皮层?
You wanna lookat the lining of his brain?

474
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:13,580
为了查看还得泵入大量造影剂--
the amount of contrast material you'd need to pump up there just to see--

475
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,380
他会脑出血
he'll bleed into his brain.

476
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:18,090
- 不 他不会 -  那样就不好玩了
- No,he won'T. - Because that wouldn'tbe interesting.

477
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,680
你自己去请求家属同意吧
You can get permissionthis time.

478
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,010
大脑被嵌套在袋中 称作脑膜
The brain is enclosedin a sack called the meninges.

479
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:29,310
难道癌症复发了?
Does this meanthe cancer's back?

480
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,460
不 不
No,no,no,no.

481
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,610
House
House.

482
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,710
如果发现是癌症
If we found cancer,

483
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:42,030
也不是原先的 而是新的癌症
it wouldn't bethe original cancer. It'd be new.

484
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,220
然后? 又是手术 化疗?
So what?More surgery? More radiation?

485
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,690
情况也不至于最坏
Might not bethe worst thing.

486
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,690
如果不是旧病 也许可以医治
If this isn'tjust ancient history, maybe it's somethingwe can correct.

487
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,660
甚至能挽救回一些大脑功能
Might even get some brain function back.

488
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,060
他会变好一点?
He could get better?

489
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,620
不
No.

490
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:09,090
他若能听懂你说话 该多好
But understanding whatyou're saying would be nice.

491
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,100
说不定你们能想办法交流
Maybe you can figure outways to communicate.

492
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,200
幸好他对你说话了
Thank god he spoketo you.

493
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,960
McneiL女士
Mrs.McneiL.

494
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,730
检查风险很高
The test to do this is very risky.

495
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:23,000
他会死
He could die.

496
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:28,390
他现在生不如死
He's already dead.

497
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,310
Chase 慢点
chase,  go slow

498
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:47,350
已经注入脊髓腔
already injected into spinal canal

499
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,680
下一站 大脑
next stop is brain

500
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:58,280
造影剂进入第4脑室
contrast material entering into the fourth ventricle.

501
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:00,600
室壁无出血
No parietal bleeds.

502
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,300
血压高 但能控制住
Blood pressure's high. But it's holding.

503
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,470
脑膜完整 无出血
meninges are intact. No bleeding.

504
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,350
天
Oh,god.

505
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,290
Foreman 过来看
Foreman,get in here.

506
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:29,560
脑科的人在手术
*******

507
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,040
你很幸运 他没有死
you are lucky he didn't die

508
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,400
我幸运? 是他没死
I'm lucky? he is the one who didn'y die

509
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,810
说过会有出血
we told you he had haemorrhage

510
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:37,750
你们说他会脑出血 不是耳出血
you told me he bleed into his brain not out of his ear

511
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,340
你得停止
gotta drop this

512
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,890
错过了什么
I'm missing something

513
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:43,970
做了危险的检查 造成了损伤
we did a dangerous test and something bad happened

514
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:45,820
如此而已
that's all this is

515
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,980
带我漫游他的脑子 Foreman
give me tour of the brain Foreman

516
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:52,920
从头游览这些扫描图 1998年
walk me through the scans

517
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,170
发生了什么
what happened

518
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:57,700
如果我脑子里长了厘米级的瘤子...
*******

519
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,720
不是这个
nothing

520
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,020
下一个 颞上部的斑点
next spec on the superior temporal region

521
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,950
重新生长出的 良性
It's regrowth, it's benign

522
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,790
旁边的星状
*****

523
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,620
活检造成的疤痕组织
scar tissue from bioposy

524
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:11,890
House 没有什么斑点可疑 是外科医生挖掘他的头
House, every spec is not suspect It's use of surgeon digging around his head

525
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:13,590
让他走吧
let him go

526
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:16,450
重新做血液检查
we do every blood test he's ever had

527
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,830
再次扫描他的头
re-scan his head

528
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,400
不
no

529
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,520
他已经受伤病折磨了8年 我不会帮你作孽
he's in sick in suffering for 8 years and I'm not gonna helping make it worse

530
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,980
不会帮你寻乐子
I'm not gonna help you make interesting

531
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:30,020
没事 Foreman对这比你在行
That's okay. Foreman's better at that stuffthan you are.

532
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:34,510
在他枕骨和下丘脑处切开5毫米
We need 5-millimeter cuts through the occipitaland hypothalamic regions.

533
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,400
不
No.

534
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:47,310
几毫米?
How many millimeters?

535
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,450
我能帮他
I can help him.

536
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,140
如此而已? 这就是你的论据?
This is it? That's your argument?

537
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,050
很充分
Seems like a good one.

538
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:59,000
只要我稍微思考你是想帮他 你得取得全权委托书
If I thought for a secondyou wanted to help him,you'd have carte blanche.

539
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,170
你这么做是为了好玩
You're doing thisbecause it's fun.

540
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:04,780
这医院里的人除了我的动机 就没别的好谈论了?
Does nobodyin this hospital have anything betterto talk about than my motives?

541
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,400
我的动机和案例没关系
My motives have nothing to dowith the case.

542
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,660
你的动机和判断息息相关
Your motives have everythingto do with your judgment.

543
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,870
这么多年来第一次 我体内没有了鸦片
For the first time in years, I've got no opiates in my body.

544
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,290
你质疑我的判断
Now you question my judgment.

545
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:16,290
一年有24次 你闯进我办公室 叫嚣着要帮谁
24 times a year you comestorming into my office, spouting that you can help someone.

546
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:18,220
可是你从来不这么说
Only you never saythose words.

547
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,390
你会嚷嚷诸如
You say something like,

548
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:23,990
"他的胰腺要爆炸了 因为大脑着了火"
"his pancreas is gonna explodebecause his brain is on fire."

549
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:26,630
你基于医学理由 而不是泛泛而谈
You come here with medicine, not with platitudes.

550
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,920
我不想说细节 惹你乏味
I didn't want to bore youwith the details.

551
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,420
根本没有细节
There are no details.

552
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,960
你只有个直觉
You have a hunch.

553
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,470
House 你不依靠直觉
House,you don't use hunches.

554
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,900
你总是有理由的
You always have reasons.

555
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:40,720
医院不是因你的突发奇想而生存 很抱歉
This hospital doesn't exist for your whims. I'm sorry.

556
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,250
明早7点 就让你的病人出院
As of 7:00 A.M. Tomorrow morning, I'm sending your patient home.

557
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:54,330
回答是不
The answer is no.

558
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:57,890
Cuddy在你离开后30秒就打电话来 说你钻牛角尖
Cuddy called 30 secondsafter you left and said you'd tryan end around.

559
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:15,010
我的腿疼了
My leg hurt.

560
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,920
厉害吗?
How bad?

561
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,860
疼到我对你说
Enough that I'mtelling you.

562
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:23,300
消失了吗?
Did it go away?

563
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,040
疼了一小会
Ached for a while.

564
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:30,590
手术后 那里第一次有感觉
First time I've felt anythingthere since the surgery.

565
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,540
但是消失了
But it went away.

566
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:37,710
肌肉痛 有些抽筋
It was muscular. There was some cramping.

567
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,980
你笑什么?
What are you smiling about?

568
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,680
你40老几了 天知道你一天跑了几英里
You're 40-somethingyears old. You've been running god knows how many miles a day.

569
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:51,320
从滑板上摔下100次 有疼痛你居然会震惊
Fallen 100 tim off that skateboard, and you're shocked to have some soreness?

570
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,890
给我开个处方
Just give mea prescription.

571
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:54,250
维柯丁?
For vicodin?

572
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:59,370
House 一般人关节痛或是抽筋 就敷个冰袋 或吃布洛芬
House,people getaching joints,cramps, they put onan ice pack.They take some ibuprofen.

573
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:01,330
我知道中年的疼痛怎么回事
I know what the pangsof middle age feel like.

574
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,820
不 你不知道
No,you don'T.

575
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:06,040
自从中年起 你每隔5分钟就吞一次止疼药
Because you've been stuffingvicodin every five minutes since you turned middle-age.

576
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,630
手术没起作用
The surgery didn't work.

577
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:09,180
不要戏弄我
Don't play me.

578
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,820
哦 你以为我耍诡计?
Oh,you thinkthis is a scam?

579
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:15,670
我认为你想博取我的同情 帮你说服Cuddy或是给你药
I think you want meto feel sorry for you and either do the end around on cuddy or give you the drugs.

580
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,350
哪一样 都让你飘飘欲仙
Either way,you get the highyou think you need.

581
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:30,010
House 手术起作用了 你没事
House,your surgery worked. You're fine.

582
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:33,380
只是要花点时间好起来
It's just gonna take timefor it to feel good.

583
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:11,080
室周系统感受到免疫反应 早期阶段释放出的细胞因子
The circumventricular systemsenses cytokines released in the early stagesof the immune response.

584
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:15,140
但神经核团释放出的前列腺素 上调了下丘脑体温控制点
But cvos releases prostaglandinsthat reset the hypothalamic set point upward,

585
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,850
除非用退烧药来治疗
unless it's countered by anti-pyretic therapy.

586
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:20,140
是的 他脑子着火了
So yeah,his brainis on fire.

587
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:22,970
试图自杀并不是自杀
The suicide attempt was not a suicide attempt.

588
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:26,730
他把轮椅开进泳池 因为不能控制体温
He drove that wheelchairinto the pool because he couldn't regulatehis body temperature.

589
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,370
他得了下丘脑功能失调
He had hypothalamicdysregulation.

590
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,640
你发现了这...
And you discovered this...

591
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,050
当你步入
when you stepped into the...

592
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:36,080
大学的泳池?
university pool?

593
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:37,630
喷泉
Fountain.

594
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,950
- 我能治好他 - 治好他
- I can cure him. - Cure him.

595
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:45,130
就算喷泉给出了指示 治疗下丘脑调节紊乱也不能让大脑重启
Even if the fountainproved anything,fixing hypothalamicdysregulation isn't gonna regenerate brain.

596
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:47,550
不能 除非他下丘脑的疤痕组织
No,but if the scar tissueon his hypothalamus

597
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:50,890
挤压了垂体 关闭了肾上腺
is restingagainst the pituitary, the adrenals would shut down.

598
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:52,140
阿狄森氏病
Addison's disease.

599
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,880
从MRI你没看到任何疤痕组织 他的CT检测--
You didn't see anyscar tissue on his mri. His ct scans--

600
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,420
- 他的大脑还有功能 - 他的体温正常
- his brain is functional. - His temperature's normal.

601
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,430
他的下丘脑和垂体都没问题
There is nothing wrong with his hypothalamusor his pituitary.

602
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:02,200
我能让他走路 让他说话
I can make him walk. I can make him talk.

603
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,270
你一身臭汗 所以才能冒出这样的瞎猜
This is a wild guess that came to youbecause you were sweating.

604
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,230
注射可的松
Inject him with cortisol.

605
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:11,420
这个人可以再次跟妻子欢好 再次拥抱儿子
The guy'll have sexwith his wife again. He'll hug his kid again.

606
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:15,170
但愿他是用这种组合
Hopefully that'sthe combination he was using.

607
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:17,560
否则我就救了一个恋童癖
Be a shameif I cured a pedophile.

608
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:21,180
你在微笑 不是好兆头
You're smiling. That's a bad sign.

609
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:22,600
你吃药了
You're high.

610
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,770
我说了过去3个月我都没沾药
I told you I haven't hadanything in three months.

611
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:26,520
你一兴奋就这样
This is as highas you get.

612
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,410
你把病例用一个无根据的理论包装
A theory that ties your case up in a neat little bow.

613
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:33,330
却拿不出一点证据
But you don't have a lickof substantiating proof.

614
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,620
你的决定不合理
Your decisiondoesn't make any sense.

615
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:42,420
注射可的松没有风险 就算我错了 有什么大不了
There is no risk to a cortisol injection. If I'm wrong,big deal.

616
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,300
他像往常一样 作为一个植物人回家 但如果我是对的
He goes home a vegetable,like he already is. But if I'm right--

617
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,380
这不是好与坏的风险权衡
this is not about downsidesor risk management.

618
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,220
重要的是让你懂得 如何接受"不"这个词
It is a big deal for youto understand the word no.

619
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,560
对不起 House
I'm sorry,house.

620
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:23,450
他要出院了
He's on his wayout of here.

621
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:28,450
我以为你会窜下楼去 在他脖子上扎一针可的松
Figured you'd beon your scooter racing down the halls to stab the patient in the neckwith cortisol.

622
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:32,740
她说"不"是对的
She was right to say no.

623
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:36,820
我自认为正确的 其实没有客观理由
I had no objective reason to thinkthat I was right.

624
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,790
只是解谜
Just needed the puzzle.

625
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,820
稍等
Hold on a sec.

626
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,040
没事吧?
Is everything all right?

627
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,880
我忘了一点事情
Yeah,it's just somethingI forgot.

628
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,780
什么?
What's that?

629
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,920
可的松
This is cortisol.

630
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:22,280
抗感染
And it's to fight infection.

631
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:26,050
帮我压一下
Wanna hold onto that?

632
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,460
贴一块纱布
Put a bandage on it.

633
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,790
他没事吧?
Let's see. Is he okay?

634
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,880
没事
Yes.

635
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,460
我们能走了吗?
Can we go now?

636
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,000
可以走了
You can go.

637
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,400
借过
Excuse me.

638
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:37,390
Richard. Richard.
Richard. Richard.

639
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,070
爸 你没事吧
Dad,you okay?

640
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,600
Richard?
Richard?

641
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:57,870
Richard! Richard!
Richard! Richard!

642
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:04,020
Richard!
Richard!

643
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:12,900
Richard.
Richard.

644
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:16,020
你站起来了
You're standing.

645
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,440
谢谢
Thank you.

646
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:54,160
他站起来了
he got up.

647
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,420
- 我得告诉House - 不
- I have to go tell house. - No.

648
00:40:57,930 --> 00:40:58,970
Cuddy.
Cuddy.

649
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,940
不能告诉他
You can't tell him.

650
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,970
当然要说 他是对的
I have to tell him. He was right.

651
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:04,360
为什么这么做?
Why did you do it?

652
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,220
为什么你觉得他有可能对?
Why did you thinkhe might be right?

653
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:08,350
因为他是House
Because he's house.

654
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:10,960
医学角度 你根据什么判断他是对的
Medically. What made you thinkhe was right?

655
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,890
- 没根据 - 他运气好
- Nothing. - He got lucky.

656
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:15,800
只能从运气解释
That's all that happened.

657
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:18,640
跟他说"不"对他是好事
Telling him nowas a good thing.

658
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,160
因为下次 他不会这么好运 他会杀死某人
Because next time,he won't get lucky. He'll kill someone.

659
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:27,170
他对了 并不表明他没错
Just becausehe was right doesn't meanhe wasn't wrong.

660
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,050
我每天都见他
I see him every day.

661
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:37,630
不能就这么...
I can't just...

662
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:40,160
人人都撒谎
everybody lies.

663
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:37,740
