according to  elizabeth kubler-ross,

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,370
<font color="#ffff00">我们在弥留之际
when we are dying...

4
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:08,960
<font color="#ffff00">或者面临巨大损失时
or have suffered  a catastrophic loss,

- we go into denial... - push another amp of calcium.

7
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:15,920
再加一安的钙
Because the loss  is so unthinkable,

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,950
<font color="#ffff00">因为损失无法想象

9
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:20,420
<font color="#ffff00">- 我们无法想象惨剧真的发生了
- we can't imagine it's true. - Clear.

00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,420
离手

11
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,450
<font color="#ffff00">然后对所有人感到愤怒
we become angry with everyone--

12
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,660
<font color="#ffff00">恨生还的人 恨自己无能为力
angry with survivors,angry with ourselves.

13
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,520
<font color="#ffff00">接着是交涉
Then we bargain...

14
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,330
该死 O'malley 挺住啊 活下来

- 加70甘露醇 开始输液 - 出血渗透到脑干
- Push 70 of mannitol and start bagging. - he's hemorrhaginginto his brain stem.

17
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,160
现在用类固醇会不会太迟了?
Is it too late for steroids?

18
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:37,690
<font color="#ffff00">我们恳求
- We beg,we plead... - he's herniating!

<font color="#ffff00">我们倾其所有
We offer everything we have.

22
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,130
<font color="#ffff00">甚至出卖灵魂
We offer up our souls...

23
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,390
<font color="#ffff00">只为换取哪怕多一天的时间
in exchangE...for just one more day.

24
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,990
Stevens 你能听见我说话吗?

25

看着我 Stevens

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,370
见鬼
damn it.

27
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,190
<font color="#ffff00">当交涉失败 愤怒难以控制
When the bargaining has failed  and the anger  is too hard to maintain,

28
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,920
<font color="#ffff00">我们陷入消沉
we fall into depression,

29

<font color="#ffff00">绝望

until finally we have to accept  that we have done  everything we can.

31
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,280
<font color="#ffff00">于是放手
We let go.

32
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:23,450
<font color="#ffff00">放手 最后接受事实

But,you know,I grew up,and growing pains did not cause me to fall down on the soccer field.

妈妈 你说得太夸张了
Mom,you're being a little dramatic.

116

你的疼痛对我来说才夸张呢 Andy

一切都太不真实了
This doesn't feel real.

123

你相信这是真的吗?

能帮我分析一下吗? 我找不出原因 觉得还是探讨一下好
Can you talk it through with me?Because I can't figure out what it is,and I think best out loud.

264
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,320
你难道没听说George O'malley的事?

267
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,870
我现在没法和你谈

268
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:10,880
现在也工作不了
I cannot work right now.

269
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:18,030
Bailey医生 我听说了
dr. Bailey... I hear that.

270
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,950
我不是麻木不仁
And I don't mean to be insensitive.

271
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:23,270
但这个孩子 他还活着啊
But this kid?This kid's still alive.

272
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,500
我不知道他到底怎么了 毫无头绪
And I don't know what's wrong with him.Not a clue.

273
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,570
所以...我要你工作起来

平片和CT呈阴性

00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,420

- 哭过没? - 没

288
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:27,250
什么也别说 在这儿陪我 就行
and don't say anything,just be here,that--that--that helps.

289
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,490
你好吗?

290
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,750
Meredith 我们需要你
Meredith.We need you.

291
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,030

295
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,400

I'm so sorry.

297
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,430
你也这么认为?
you,too,huh?

298
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,370
发育期痛 你说这是发育期痛...
Growing pains.You're saying this is growing p--

299
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:09,930
不不 不仅仅是发育期痛
no,no,no.Not just growing pains.

300
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:13,880
他有轻微的脊柱侧凸 连同生长突增
He has a mild case of scoliosis,whh,combined with a growth spurt,

301
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,940
会导致疼痛及球场上的行动迟缓
could account for the pain and the clumsiness on the soccer field.

302
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,570
观察几星期看是否康复
So we'll see if it settles in a couple of weeks,

303
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,570
如果没有 你们还得来再接受检测
and if not,then you'll come back in for more tests.

304
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,120
为什么现在不检测?
Why don't you just run them now?

305
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:27,560
因为下面的检测需要给Andy脊柱扎针
Because the next set of tests involve things like sticking large needles into andy's spine.

306
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,870
太好了 那我们回家
All right,then.Heading home.

307
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,010
你对此能肯定吗?
You're sure about this?

308
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,190
不
No.

309
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,950
但我能给你开些肌肉松弛剂
But I'm gonna write a prescription for muscle relaxants,

310
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:41,790
有情况 我随时都在这里 希望没有
and you know that I'm here if you need me,which I really hope that you won'T.

311
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,510
O'malley的事 Torres决定了吗?
Did torres decide about o'malley?

312
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,490
- 器官捐献? - 我不知道

Look,I... I know this is the worst possible moment,

316
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,170
但是...我们得谈谈
but...  we need to talk.

317
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,690
董事局正在策划变动
The board is planning a coup.

318
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,830
他们说你失职
They're saying that you dropped the ball,

319
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:18,190
致使医院排名没有上升

他们想撤你的职

他们希望我支持这个决定

他们希望我站出来 顶上这个位子
They're asking me to step up,to take the job.

323

我的位子?
Take my job?

324
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,590
我说我要考虑一下
I told them I'd think about it.

325
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,950
以此帮你争取时间 但你得有应对计划
I bought you some time.But you need a plan.

326
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,110

她需要一个支持团队

398

"除热浪和异味之外  火人节真的让人惊喜"
Aside from the heat and the smell,burning man was amazing.

401
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:09,660

there is an appointed time for everything,and a time for every affair under the heavens...

402

他死了

414
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:07,590
他要下葬了 牧师却在念经典的摇滚乐歌词
They're about to put him in the ground,and the priest is doing classic rock lyrics.

415
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:12,460

And that girl,that redhead is crying harder than his mother,and she never even met him.

416

你不知道我作出了怎样的牺牲
You have no idea what I have sacrificed.

433
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,860
每次失算的背后 都有上百次的贡献
For every miscalculation you think u see,there have been a hundred things

434
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:56,200

435
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,220
我是站在你这边的 不是吗?
Look,I'm on your side,okay?

436
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,760
我不是董事会成员 我不是Jennings
I'm--I'm not the board.I'm not jennings.

437
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,220
那就别来烦我
Well,then back off,then.

438
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:07,600
别来烦我 给我时间想想
Just back off and... you give me time to think.

439
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:13,360
给我点时间 O'malley是我的实习生

I s gonna clean ous locker,give his stuff to his mom,but...

445
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:05,560
我不配做George的朋友
I was a bad friend to george.

446
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:13,150
我对他就像Clara的朋友对她一样 给她送旅行明信片 而她却永远去不了了
I was about as good a friend to him as clara's friends,who keep sending postcards from the trip that she'll never get to take.

447
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:17,850
我只是... 我完全抛弃了他
I just... I... I abandoned him completely.

448
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:24,090
我搬了出来 再也不和他说话 为啥呢?
I-I-I just... moved out and--and stopped talking to him and... why?

449
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:29,270
因为我认为他帅 他却不觉得我漂亮
Because--because he didn't thini was as hot as I thought he was or be-because he--he didn't--

450
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:31,550
因为他没有回报我的爱?
he didn't love me back?

451
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:39,030
现在也许不该问这个问题 但我还是想问
This... may be bad timing,but I gotta ask.

452
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:42,110
他好在哪里?
What did that guy have?

453
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:44,670
我是说 他长得不咋的
I mean,he wasn't much to look at.

454
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:50,030
但你 Stevens和Torres都对他死心塌地?
But you and stevens and torres?

455
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:52,040
说实话
Tell the truth.

456
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:56,970
他...那里很雄壮么?
Was he... you know... hung?

457
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:02,670
- 这... - 我知道 现在不该问

458
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:05,570

- I-- but seriously,he was kind of a dorky little dude.

459
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:06,900
别说了
Stop.Stop talking.

460
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,780
对不起 对不起
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

461
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,690

00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,730

You are gonna come back in 12 days for another round of I.L.-2,

and then you have your pet-scan two weeks after that.

472
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:59,360
你不必再躺在病床上了
But there's no need for you to keep living in this bed.

473
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,970
放轻松点
You should take it easy.

474
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:07,010
你还是癌症病人 但不用再做手术了
You're still a cancer patient,but you're no longer a surgical patient.

475

477
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:26,360

483
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,880

手一点都不能动

That's what she always says.

499
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:43,630
就像 我想去跳伞的时候

Okay,um,dr. Chang is basically a figurehead.You're clear on that,right?

他和你一样 遇上了事故
He had an accident,like you.

631
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:46,170
他的身体状况比你还好些 但是他死了
He--he wasn't even as bad off as you were,and he didn't make it.

632
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:51,610
Clara 我知道这么说你不信 但是你活下来是奇迹
Clara,i know that it doesn't feel like it,but it is a miracle that you lived.

633
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,420

00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:13,930
不关你的事
You had no business.

640
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,130
我只有一只手能动
I've got one working hand.

641

也许再也不能走路

642

第20天
********

660
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:28,050
<font color="#ffff00">字典对悲痛的解释是 "因丧失和苦恼而造成的 严重的精神创伤或压力"</font>
the dictionary  defines grief as,"keen mental suffering  or distress  "over affliction or loss.

661
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,310
<font color="#ffff00">"剧烈的悲痛"</font>
"Sharp sorrow.

662
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:33,640
<font color="#ffff00">"痛心的懊悔"</font>
Painful regret.

663
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:44,370
<font color="#ffff00">作为医生和科学家 我们一直被教导 要遵循书本 定律与命数</font>
"  As surgeons,as scientists,we're taught to learn from  and rely on books,on definitions,on definitives.

664
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:49,820
<font color="#ffff00">但现实生活中 条条框框几乎没用</font>
But in life...  strict definitions  rarely apply.

665
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:57,720
<font color="#ffff00">生活中 哀伤不仅表现为剧烈的悲痛</font>
In life...  grief can look like  a lot of things  that bear little resemblance  to sharp sorrow.

666
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:01,730
第21天
*******

667
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:05,050
"你也没错过什么"
"You're not missing much.

668
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:07,840
"纽约这城就一股骚味"
New york smells like pee.

669
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,770
天 我恨死她们了
" God,I hate them.

670
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:12,270
还痛?
more pain?

671
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:14,900
你CT结果很快就会出来
Your C.T. Results should be back soon.

672
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,930
我没事
I'm fine.

673
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,340
今晚你应该回家
You should go home tonight.

674
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:23,220
不用24小时盯着我 怕我自杀
You can call off the 24-hour suicide watch,you know?

675
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:25,930
说真的 我好多了
Honestly,I'm better now.

676
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:28,070
真的
I am.

677
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,450
知道我是怎么想的吗?
Do you know what I think?

678
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:35,730
我觉得你是利用我 借此不搬去跟男友同居
I think you're using me to avoid moving in with your boyfriend.

679
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:36,610
才不是呢
am not.

680
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:40,770
要不这样 你搬去和男友住 我让你通知我妈
I'll make you a deal-- you move in with your boyfriend,and I'll let you call my mum.

681
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:42,160
够狠
Oh,mean.

682
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,220
胆小鬼
Chicken.

683
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:50,980
Clara 你的CT结果显示 小肠感染 而且结肠发炎
okay,uh,clara,the C.T. Shows you have an infection in your small bowel and your colon is inflamed.

684
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:53,420
应该是你在水上感染到的
It's most likely something you picked up in the water.

685
00:43:53,420 --> 00:44:00,360
已经化脓 也就是说 你需要马上手术
But it seems to have formed an abscess,which means you need surgery right away.

686
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:02,760
不要
No.

687
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,620
- 如果不做... - 不要
- Uh,if we don't go--  - no.

688
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:08,020
不要再动手术 我再也不要被人剖开了
No more surgery.I'm not being cut open again.

689
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,790
- 好吧 呃... - 不要
- Okay,uh--  - no.

690
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:12,780
给你点时间 好好考虑一下
You just take a minute.Take a few minutes.

691
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,660
我等下回来 到时再说
And I'll come back,and we'll discuss it.

692
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:21,290
给她打术前抗生素 预定手术室
um,start her on pre-op antibiotics and book an O.R.

693
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:26,530
还有别的选择不? 能只吃药不? 能...
What are the options?Can you givee drugs?Can you-- 

694
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:30,130
不行 你要动手术 很简单的手术
no,you need surgery,but it's a simple procedure.

695
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:31,490
如果顺利 你就会...
And if it all goes as planned,you sh--

696
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:35,120
我那快艇就没那么顺利
 well,my boat de didn't exactly go as planned.

697
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:40,070
跟我说 最坏的情况会怎样
So tell me,worst case.

698
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:46,410
最坏的情况是...
Well,uh,worst case is... 

699
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:49,400
我们要剪掉一段结肠 接上结肠瘘袋
that we'd have to take out a part of your colon and give you a colostomy bag-- 

700
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,390
结肠瘘袋?
colostomy bag?

701
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:56,140
体外粪袋? 我爷爷就有一个 那真是...
A pooh bag outside your body?My granddad had one of those.It was-- 

702
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:58,390
只有很小很小的可能性
no,but it--it's a small,small possibility.

703
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:01,790
不要粪袋 不要手术 不要
No pooh bag.No surgeryno.

704
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:04,930
- 感染会要了你的命 Clara - 不要
- The infection will kill you,clara  - no.

705
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:08,650
别再要我动手术了
No more surgery.

706
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:16,100
我们开了止痛药 按照肾盂肾炎治疗
We tried pain meds and treated him for pyelonephritis.

707
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:19,200
但有可能是更严重的病情 所以又做了个膀胱内压测量图
But it looks like it could be something more serious,so we did a C.M.G.

708
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,140
就因为尿道 你做了膀胱内压测量图?
You did a C.M.G.For a U.T.I.?

709
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:23,780
- 你怎么会以为... - 因为没其他主意了
- Why would you even look for something--  - because we were out of ideas.

710
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:27,480
膀胱内压测量图结果呈阴性 所以可能是神经引起的
The C.M.G. Was negative.So we went back to a possible neurological cause.

711
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,370
如果你授权三维核磁共振  病情就能更清楚了
So if we could get a better look,if you could give us permission to get a 3-d M.R.I.,

712
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:36,350
- 我们可以... 只是可能... - 主任 这孩子三个星期内看了4次急诊
- We could maybe,just possibly--  - chief,this kid's been in the E.R.Four times in the last three weeks 

713
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:37,970
因为止痛药不起作用
because the pain meds aren't working.

714
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:40,680
- 为什么不能... - 5000美元 Karev
- Why can't we just-- sir? - $5,000,karev.

715
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:44,370
不管你跟Robbin医生想啥办法 得把这钱给我
That's how much either you or dr. Robbins would have to put up to cover that scan.

716
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:47,510
否则 今天下午你跟我去董事会
Otherwise,you could come with me to my board meeting this afternoon

717
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:51,710
解释你把这家医院当慈善机构来开
and explain why you're running this hospital like it's a charity.

718
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:56,480
不是吧 这就哭?
dude,are you crying?

719
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,910
我惧怕权威
I have authority issues.

720
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:02,000
快闪 Karev
walk away,karev.

721
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:10,280
- 你怎么才能不谋杀我的病人 Yang? - 谋杀你...
- Where do you get off killing my patients,yang? - Killing your-- 

722
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:14,880
你自作主张叫那女孩不要做救命手术 你就是在谋杀她
when you take it upon yourself to talk that girl out of a lifesaving surgery,you're killing her.

723
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,210
我没有让她不做 她对手术有疑问
I didn't talk her... she had questions about the surgery.

724
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:20,230
你当时离开了
You left the room.

725
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:27,020
我离开是为了让脆弱抓狂的病人 有时间跟空间考虑接受手术
No,I left the room to give a very fragile,very distraught patient time and space to accept what's being asked of her.

726
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:30,750
只有接受后 我才会告诉她手术的潜在风险
Then and only then would I have discussed the possible risks with,

727
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:35,290
我敢保证 比你一直以来的做法 更得体更仁慈
I'm certain,more tact and sensitivity than you have ever displayed in all the time that I've known you.

728
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:38,220
- 她问了... - 她问什么不关我事
- She asked--  - no.I don't care what she ahe asked you.

729
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:44,730
如果她再问你任何问题 你只能说 "我得去问问主治医师"
And if s asks you anything else,your only answer will be,"let me ask my attending.

730
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:52,570
第22天
*******

731
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:55,990
真好吃 餐厅有卖吗?
" These are good.Do they sell these in the cafeteria?

732
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:57,300
不卖
no.

733
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,200
不对 那是给癌症病人的冰棒
No,those are the cancer pops.

734
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,380
怎么好事都被癌症病人给占了?
Why do cancer people get all the fun?

735
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:06,340
你感觉怎样了?
How do you feel,iz?

736
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:10,060
我不指望一下子就好 不过我感觉良好
I'm not looking forward to the hurling that's about to happen,but I feel okay.I feel good.

737
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:12,130
Bailey发飙了
Bailey's on some sort of rampage.

738
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:15,430
应该是O'Malley的事带来的功能紊乱
I think it's post-o'malley stress disorder.

739
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:19,290
她不知道如何处理悲痛
she's not dealing with her grief.

740
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:20,530
你听着像Owen的心理医生
You sound like owen's shrink.

741
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:26,040
Owen的心理医生不让他们嘿咻 所以她这么暴躁反常
Owen's shrink... is withholding sex,so she is grumpy and inappropriate.

742
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,470
Derek也是这样? 忍着不做爱?
Is derek doing that,too,withholding sex?

743
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:30,030
Derek干嘛要忍着?
Why would derek withhold sex?

744
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:32,900
Alex就在忍着 什么都在忍着
Alex is withholding... everything.

745
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,890
好像是在害怕 但我不知道他怕什么
It's like he's afraid,but i don't know what he's afraid of.

746
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:36,300
他怕跟癌症病人做爱
He's afraid of the cancer sex.

747
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,980
- Cristina! - 他不想后半辈子都吃癌症冰棒
- Cristina! - He doesn't want to end up with a cancer pop.

748
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:41,210
- Cristina! - 闭上你臭嘴吧
- Cristina! - Just shut the hell up.

749
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:43,320
我又不传染 Cristina
I'm not contagious,cristina.

750
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,720
我知道啊
I know that.

751
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,830
换作我 就愿意跟你做爱
I would totally have sex with you.

752
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:50,560
真的?
really?

753
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:51,710
什么都不带?
Nothing?

754
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:52,970
连个抽屉也不带?
You don't even want a drawer?

755
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:53,860
不带
no.

756
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:55,680
那牙刷咧? 换洗内裤?
How about a toothbrush,change of panties?

757
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,540
- 不带 - 靠
- No. - Damn.

758
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,400
我爱死你的小裤裤了
I like your panties.

759
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,760
我在整理思绪
I am trying to focus.

760
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,420
今天我就是住院医师了
I'm--I'm becoming a resident today.

761
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:04,090
我要集中注意力
I need to focus.

762
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:05,980
我就住在那医院对面
I'm right across the street from the hospital.

763
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:08,760
如果你和我住 你能参加的手术会翻几番呢
If you crash here sometimes,you'll get a jump on a lot of surgeries.

764
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,300
好了好了
Okay,okay.

765
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:13,270
哪件好? 我今天第一天在西慈上班 要打扮得漂漂亮亮
Which one?It's my first day at mercy west,and I want to look nice.

766
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:17,280
要给人认真能干坚强的印象 而不是任人摆布的人
You know,seous,talented,hard-core,not someone you push around.

767
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:22,380
好看又性感 就象我自身一样
Nice but hot... like me.

768
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:23,860
那件
That one.

769
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:25,590
真的? 我还以为这件好
Really?I thought this one.

770
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:28,000
太性感 约会的时候穿合适 穿那件
Too hot.Better for a date.That one.

771
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,990
好 给你 你能... 谢谢了
Okay. Here.Can you--thanks.

772
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:44,610
好了

773
00:48:44,610 --> 00:48:46,490
- 没那么性感了? - 没那么性感了

774
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:48,530
好了 不错 谢谢
Okay.okay,okay.Good. Thanks.

775
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:50,230
祝我好运吧
Wish me luck.

776
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:53,600
或者不用 反正我那么能干坚强
Or not luck,'cause I'm all talented and hard-core.

777
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,590
你是个主治医师了 Torres 好好去耍威风吧
You're an attending,torres.Go kick some ass.

778
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:02,970
那 呃...
so,um... 

779
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:11,030
你是不是忘了说 你那惹火坚强的 前任性伴侣就住你对面?
did you forget to mention that your hot,hard-core ex-sex-friend lives right across the hall?

780
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:12,820
我没说?
Did I?

781
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,750
是啊 没说
Yeah,you did.

782
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:21,850
也只有在我做主任的这任期 西雅图仁爱医院才发展成为名声最响
And it is only under my tenure as chief that seattle grace has grown into one of the most renowned,

783
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:25,850
最令人称道 最吃香的外科中心之一
lauded and sought-after surgical centers in the country.

784
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:28,980
想撤我... 不行
Replacing me... no.

785
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:32,240
否则只会造成巨大错误
Disrupting that process would be an epic mistake.

786
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:37,520
也是因为这样 今天我才站在这里 信心十足地说
It is for that reason that I stand before you today and say with the utmost confidence

787
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:46,320
没有人比我更了解更关心仁爱医院
that there is no one who understands and cares more about seattle grace than... than me.

788
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:51,070
太小题大做了 我没事
look,this is ridiculous.I'm fine.

789
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:54,580
只是扭了下脚 我还要去开会
It's a sprained ankle,and--and I have a meeting I have to get to.

790
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:56,490
我都说我没事了
Look,I said I'm fine.

791
00:49:56,490 --> 00:49:58,810
- 主任? - Torres 谢天谢地
- Chief? - Torres.Thank god.

792
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:00,250
你出车祸了?
You were in a car accident?

793
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:03,710
小事一桩 我闯红灯了 分了下神
Oh,it was minor.I ran a red light.I was distracted.

794
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:05,390
我没事
I am fine.

795
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:06,900
能速战速决不?
Can we make this quick?

796
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:09,050
我要去参加董事会议
I have a meeting with the board.

797
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:10,590
好
Okay.

798
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,300
我看看
Let's see.

799
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:15,780
我也不清楚 这伤口看着满深的
Ooh,I don't know,sir.This lac looks pretty deep.

800
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:21,630
肯定要缝上几针 还有脚踝 不妙啊
You'll definitely need stitches.and the ankle--oh,yikes.

801
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:23,610
搞不好还要动手术
Yeah.You could need surgery.

802
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:25,310
只是扭伤 Torres
It's--it's a sprain,torres.

803
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:27,240
你们认识?
you two know each other?

804
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:33,450
Webber医生跟我可有历史了 算起来也一起工作有五六年了
dr. Webber and i go way back,huh we worked together for,what was it,five,six years?

805
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:36,350
我也不想的 不过你这伤口要好好处理下
You know,I hate to say it,but you're gonna have to have that lac repaired.

806
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:42,170
再加上这是所教学医院 而且Mckee医生 是第一天上班 我得让他帮你
and this being a teaching hospital,not to mention dr. Mckee's first day,I have to let him work you up.

807
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:44,960
缝合你会的吧 Mckee医生?
So you know how to do sutures,right,dr. Mckee?

808
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,030
可熟练了
Damn straight.

809
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:47,670
很好
Great.

810
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:49,040
很高兴见到你 主任
Good seeing you,chief.

811
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,050
医...
Look,doc--d-- 

812
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:53,190
她说这是我第一天 是在说笑呢 
she's,uh,she's just kidding about this being my first day.

813
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:56,620
已经是...第八天了
It's,uh,it's my eighth.

814
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,740
你要用什么线?
What kind of sutures are you using?

815
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:00,100
- 3号尼龙线? - 不对
- Uh,3-0 nylon? - No,no,no.

816
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,820
用皮肤粘合剂 时间短 愈合快
Use dermabond.It takes less time and it heals quicker.

817
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:06,390
我也知道 可没那么多预算
Yeah,I know,but,like,budget cuts,you know?

818
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:12,740
你喜欢在这上班吗 Mckee医生?
you like working in this place,doctor,um,mckee?

819
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:14,330
你认为这是个很好的团队?
I mean,you think it's a strong program?

820
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:18,010
爱死了 第八天就能独立做手术
Yeahit rocks.Like,day eight,and I'm doing unsupervised procedures?

821
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:20,460
差不到哪去
Not too shabby.

822
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:23,580
差不到哪去
Not too shabby.

823
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:27,150
第23天
*****

824
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,290
他在西北大学及哈佛大学学习过
Uh,he trained at northwestern and then at harvard.

825
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:40,790
就在这附近长大
Uh,he grew up like five miles away from here.

826
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:44,860
小康家庭 有足够的亲情
Um,not rich,not poor.Comfortable and well-loved by his parents,

827
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:48,170
他急切地想要创造人生
but,um,uh,itching to do something more with his life,

828
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:49,970
所以申请入伍 当时年龄是...
which is when he enlisted,at the age of-- 

829
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:54,160
Cristina 不是叫你交读书报告
cristina,this is not a book report.

830
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:58,070
我只是想告诉Wyatt医生我了解你
I'm trying to explain to dr. Wyatt that I know things about you.

831
00:51:58,070 --> 00:51:59,410
- Cristina... - 等等
- Cristina--  - wait,wait,wait.

832
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:01,840
他也知道我的事 如果你是想说这话 我们有聊过的
He knows things about me,too,if thas what you're gonna say,'cause we talk.

833
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,930
我们一直都在交流
I mean,we talk all the time.

834
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:07,280
亲爱的?
Honey?

835
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,380
亲爱的?
"honey"?

836
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:10,910
Cristina 跟你直说吧
Cristina,let me be clear.

837
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:13,650
我不只是想你们增进了解
It's not just that I want the two of you to get to know each other,

838
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:16,560
我想让Owen觉得跟你在一起非常自在
it's that I want owen to feel comfortable with you.

839
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:20,210
他跟我在一起的时候可自在了
Oh,he is comfortable with me.

840
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:25,390
没事的
It's fine.

841
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:28,110
你和她说 没事的
You can talk to her.It's fine.

842
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:33,330
好吧 Cristina 他跟你聊天 跟你在一起很自在
okay. Cristina,um,he talks to you,he's comfortable with you.

843
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:37,320
他跟你聊过心灵创伤不?
Does he talk to you about his trauma?

844
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:42,020
Owen跟你聊过战争吗?
Does owen talk to you about the war?

845
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:47,680
跟你聊过那晚...他掐你的事吗?
Does he talk to you about the incident between you two-- the choking?

846
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:57,590
Owen的创后压力之所以没浮现 是在于他一直逃避谈论战争
Owen's post-traumatic stress is fed... by his avoidance of talking about anything in the war.

847
00:52:57,590 --> 00:53:05,670
如想治愈 他需要和你我谈论
In order to improve,to heal,he's going to have to start talking about it,to you and to me.

848
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:14,240
我担心的是 如果你们沉迷色欲 他连这头都开不了
And my concern is,if you get lost in the lust of it all,he won't have to make a start.

849
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:17,200
他没必要那么做
He won't have any reason to.

850
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:22,540
他可能觉得拥有一切 但最后只会失去
He'll feel that he has everything he needs until he doesn'T.

851
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:29,320
所以 我想请你等待
So... I'm asking you to wait.

852
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:37,360
好了
finished.

853
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:39,540
读给我听
read it back to me.

854
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:40,690
"嗨 妈妈"
"Hi,mom.

855
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:43,390
"请先做好心理准备 因为您可能无法接受"
Please prepare yourself,"because this is gonna be difficult to read.

856
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:44,280
"我出意外了"
I've been in an accident.

857
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,030
跟我说的完全两样
" That's not what I said.

858
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:48,240
- "我受了极重的伤 动过了17次手术" - 你不能这么发
- "I've suffered terrible injuries and 17 surgeries. - " You can't send that to her.

859
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,670
"我现在腹腔感染"
"Currently,I'm suffering from an abdominal infection,"

860
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:53,810
"但我拒绝治疗 所以将不久于人世"
which I've refused to treat,so I'm gonna die soon.

861
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:56,500
"请您尽快赶来 如果您到之前我已离开"
"Please come quickly,mom,"and if I'm gone before you get here,"

862
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,210
- "我想让您知道 我是多么爱您" - 别说了
- I just wanted to tell you how much I love you"...  - stop it.

863
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:02,720
- "也谢谢您辛苦拉扯了我" - 贱货
-"And to thank you for making me from scratch. - " Bitch.

864
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,360
你真是犯贱
You're a bitch.

865
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:07,500
我可以按铃叫护士来推你进手术室
I can hit the call button and I can have the nurses in here to take you into surgery,

866
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,380
要不我就发送信息 你自己看着办
or I can hit "send"--that's the deal.

867
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:12,360
我要告你 还有这间医院
I will sue you.I will sue you and this hospital.

868
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:16,590
告不了 你马上就没命了
No,you won'T.You'll be dead.

869
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,720
拜托
Please.

870
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:25,790
你好 护士说你点名要我?
hello.The nurses said you called for me?

871
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:27,890
这是Andy
This is andy.

872
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:29,790
Andy Michaelson
Andy michaelson.

873
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:31,320
不好意思 我之前治疗过你吗?
I'm sorry.Have i treated you before?

874
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:35,110
Arizona Robbins医生引见的
dr. Arizona robbins referred us.

875
00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:38,660
哦 Andy 你就是那个...
Oh,andy.you're the-- you're the kid with the-- 

876
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:42,500
那个不知道得什么病的小孩 没错
with the thing no one can diagnose.Yeah,that's us.

877
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:45,190
那Robbins医生让你们来西慈医院是想...
okay,so dr. Robbins sent you here to mercy west because...

878
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:49,900
这是Andy在仁爱医院的病例副本
these are copies of andy's paperwork from seattle grace.

879
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,730
我们无法入睡
we don't sleep anymore.

880
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:54,740
天天就奔波于医院
We basically just go to the hospital,you know?

881
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:58,250
我手足无措 觉得自己是不称职的母亲
And I don't know what else to do,'cause I feel like a terrible mother.

882
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:02,930
- 妈妈 - 我太不称职了 我应该...
- Mom. - I feel like a terrible mother because I'm supposed to... 

883
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:05,400
- 我应该做些事的 但我做不了 - 妈
- I'm supposed to do something,and I can'T. - Mom.

884
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,200
我不是学医的
You know,I didn't go to medical school.

885
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,300
我学的是该死的历史
I majored in freakin' history.

886
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,540
但你们是医生
Y-you're the doctors,you know?

887
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:12,790
你们可是医生啊
You're the doctors.

888
00:55:12,790 --> 00:55:15,840
基本上来说 我们现在每一个人
And basically,all we've been doing up to this point,any of us,

889
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:18,700
所有人 就是在让我儿子染上药瘾而已
all we've been doing is getting my kid strung out on these pain meds.

890
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:21,200
- 妈 别说了 - 不行 Andy
- Mom,stop. - I can't,andy. 

891
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,610
我不得不说
I can't stop.

892
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:33,710
我们无法入睡 我陪他一起失眠 我很害怕
We don't sleep.He can't sleep.We can't sleep.And I'm scared.

893
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:39,970
Robbins说 她需要你做脊柱三维核磁共振
And dr. Robbins said that what she needs for you to give us is a 3-d M.R.I. Of his spine.

894
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:44,150
她还说你肯定不肯做 因为没什么迹象之类
And she said you wouldn't want to because there's no indication or whatever,

895
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:48,590
但她说这有必要 拜托了
but she says that's what he needs.Please.

896
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:51,940
别让我显得如此无用
I can't be this useless.

897
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:55,050
还有 你也不能
And you know what?Neither can you.

898
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:57,890
拜托
Please.

899
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:02,170
小肠有许多坏疽
that's a lot of necrotic small bowel.

900
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:03,740
能挽救吗?
can you save any of it?

901
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:05,600
昨天就可以
Yestery I could have.

902
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,970
昨天只需要一个简单的引流
Yesterday this would've been a simple drainage.

903
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:15,910
但那是在Yang医生威胁她 做没必要的结肠造口术之前
But that was before dr. Yang threatened my patient with a colostomy that thankfully will not be necessary,

904
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:19,790
因为这根本和结肠没什么关系
because it did not actually involve the colon.

905
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:23,300
我能干点什么?
how can I help?

906
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,960
你干得够多的了
Oh,you've done enough.

907
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:36,100
她提了问题 我如实回答根本没错 这是我的工作
She asked me a question.I was right to answer it.I did my job.

908
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:39,300
病人要求我说明手术的风险
A patient asked me to disclose the risks of a surgical procedure,

909
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:42,920
法律及职业道德要求我这么做
and I am required by law and my oath to do so.

910
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:47,840
你要是有办法粉饰结肠造口术 我洗耳恭听
If you know a way to sugarcoat a colostomy bag,I would like to hear it.

911
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:53,900
你要是知道该怎么和住院医生说话 我也洗耳恭听
If you know a more respectl way to speak to an attending surgeon,I'd like to hear that.

912
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:56,620
在你学会之前 别和我说话
Until you do,you don't talk to me.

913
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:59,390
别跟着我了
You're off my service.

914
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:03,660
来真的? 你没毛病吧?!
Okay,okay,seriously?What is your problem?!

915
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:13,320
这么多上层到场? 搞得人心慌慌
more suits?It's freaking people out.

916
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:18,420
又是减小规模又是企业接管的 有人说Webber要走为上策了
There's talk of downsizing,corporate takeovers,rumors that webber's jumping ship.

917
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:21,770
你和主任那么熟 他是怎么打算的?
You've got the chief's ear.What's he got planned?

918
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:24,580
- 这是化验结果 - 谢谢
- here's the test. - thank you.

919
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:27,460
他要退休了
he's retiring.

920
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:29,100
他们要选我当主任
They're making me chief.

921
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:30,610
- 不是吧 - 是的
- No. - Yeah.

922
00:57:30,610 --> 00:57:32,950
- 真的? - 是
- Really? - yeah.

923
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:34,860
- 真的呀? - 对
- Really?  - Yep.

924
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:37,890
主任没向我透露过半点风声
I mean,the chief never said anything to me.

925
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:40,630
要不我肯定要拼命争取
I would've fought you hard for that.

926
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:46,330
我猜他就是想要你做 祝贺了
Well,I guess if that's what he wants... I guess,uh,congratulations are in order.

927
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:51,980
等等 你不是... 你逗我玩呢?
wait,that was... you're messing with me?

928
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:53,660
你太好骗了
It's just too easy.

929
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:56,080
你可真够卑劣的 知道吗?
You got a meantreak,you know that?

930
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:58,540
卑劣
Mean.

931
00:57:59,390 --> 00:58:02,340
说真的 到底怎么回事?
seriously,what's going on?

932
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:04,750
我不知道
I have no idea.

933
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:15,510
我准备了葡萄酒 白的和红的
oh,I have wine-- white and red.

934
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:18,680
还有烟 我知道这个不好
And I have cigarettes,which is awful,I know.

935
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:23,220
但我只在非常非常特殊的情况下才抽 比如现在 我知道自己有麻烦了
But I only smoke 'em very,very,very occasionally,and it's only when I know I'm gonna be in trouble,like now.

936
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:27,600
太不合适了 愚蠢且操控欲强
It was inappropriate,not to mention manipulative and stupid.

937
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,100
- 你抽烟? - 我知道 听着
- You smoke? - I know.Okay,listen.

938
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:31,980
我知道你完全有理由生我的气 但我真是没办法了
I know you have every right to be mad at me,but I ran out of options,so--

939
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:34,150
这个检测非常贵 且没有迹象表明非做不可
it's an expensive test.There was no indication to do it.

940
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:37,560
Webber不让你做情有可原!
There's a reason webber turned you down!

941
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,450
所以你就没做?
So you didn't do it?

942
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:41,630
我当然做了 Arizona
Of course I did it,arizona.

943
00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:44,650
- 太谢谢了 - 先别谢我
- Thank you. - No.Don't thank me yet.

944
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:46,120
没扫描出任何结果
The scan didn't show anything.

945
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:47,610
啊?! 不会吧 什么都没有?
What?!Come on,nothing?

946
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:52,030
这看起来不太对劲
No.Okay,now that.That looks a little funny to me.

947
00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:55,470
我也这么觉得 但放射科医生说这很正常
I thought so,too,but the radiologist said it's normal.

948
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:59,140
好 来吧
oh,okay,all right.Just... here.

949
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:02,730
他的病史和体检记录有任何异常吗?
Is there anything peculiar about his h&p?

950
00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:07,250
* I'm gonna let you down gonna toss you around *
* I'm gonna let you down   gonna toss you around *

951
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:11,160
* gonna make you want everything you haven't found *
* gonna make you want everything you haven't found *

952
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,200
* I'm gonna hold your hand *
* I'm gonna hold your hand * 

953
00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:16,440
不好意思
sorry!Sorry.

954
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:18,770
真...抱歉
Just... uh,sorry.

955
00:59:18,770 --> 00:59:20,510
很抱歉
Sorry.We're sorry.

956
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:23,440
我们会把台子洗干净的
We'll be sure to clean the countertop.

957
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:29,060
你们以从不这样的 但现在无时不刻 无所不在
Uh,you didn't used to do this before,and now it's kind of all the time,everywhere.

958
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:31,750
- 我就是有点... - 你知道 我们...
- And--and I didn't--  - yeah,well,you know,it'S...

959
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:33,760
结婚了 所以...
we're married now and...

960
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:37,120
就有所改变 抱歉在厨房的台子上做
things have changed a little,but,uh,we're sorry about the countertop.

961
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:40,340
所以 你们真是那样?
so you guys are-- you're really-- that's it?

962
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:41,750
那个即时贴 是真的?
The post-it,that's for real?

963
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:44,860
对 是真的
Yeah,that's for real.

964
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:51,070
第30天
*****

965
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:58,410
看什么呢?
 what you reading?

966
00:59:58,410 --> 01:00:01,590
一个病例 诊断不出来 快把我逼疯了
Yeah,I got this patient I'm trying to diagnose.It's driving me nuts.

967
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:04,080
那就休息一下吧 我想你了
So take a break.I miss you.

968
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:06,290
我就在这啊
Well,I'm right here.

969
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:08,260
你不在
No,you're not.

970
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:10,760
你的心不在 我很想你
You're here,but you're not here,and I miss you.

971
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:13,290
Iz 拜托 我要工作
Iz,come on.I'm trying to work.

972
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:21,620
我希望长个脑瘤
I'm wishing for a brain tumor.

973
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:25,080
我一直希望有个大肿瘤能压住大脑
I'm wishing all the time for a giant tumor that would just press down on my brain

974
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:31,460
让我能臆想出George 和他说说话
and make me hallucinate george... so that I could talk to him again,

975
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:33,050
和他一起放声大笑
so I could laugh with him again.

976
01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:39,610
我...我真想他啊
I... I miss him... so much.

977
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:43,500
我一直在想他 我想让自己好一点
I miss him all the time,and I just want to feel better.

978
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:44,570
一分钟也好 你明白吗?
Even for a minute,younow?

979
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:50,160
希望自己能有一分钟不想着脑瘤
I just want to be a person who isn't wishing for a brain tumor just for one minute.

980
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:53,150
因为癌症 我不能喝酒
And I can't drink because of the cancer meds.

981
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:55,030
我也不吸毒 现在更没法工作
I don't do drugs.I can't even work right now.

982
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:58,120
没有任何能分散注意力的事
I don't have any distractions.

983
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:01,940
我好伤心 我真想念George
I'm sad... and I miss george.

984
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:08,430
拜托 进屋来让我好受一些
So please... please... come inside and help me feel better.

985
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:15,940
"我想George了" 真有你的
"I miss george." Nice.

986
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:19,690
真具诱惑性
Real seductive.

987
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:39,250
第36天
*******

988
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:43,850
Mark在吗?
Is,uh,mark around?

989
01:01:43,850 --> 01:01:44,900
他在冲澡
He's in the shower.

990
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:47,490
谢谢
Oh,thanks.

991
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:51,930
嗨 你知道主任到底怎么回事吗?
Hey,hav have you heard anything about what's happening with the chief?

992
01:01:51,930 --> 01:01:56,290
西慈传得沸沸扬扬的 说他可能到我们那儿工作
There's all these rumors floating around mercy west,like he might be coming to work for us.

993
01:01:56,290 --> 01:01:57,980
这样我的日子可不好过了啊
That would not go well for me.

994
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:00,370
我什么也没听说 我再去问问Derek
I haven't heard anything.I'll check with derek again.

995
01:02:00,370 --> 01:02:02,950
帮我递一下洗发水
Can you hand me the shampoo?

996
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:05,360
谢谢
Thank you.

997
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:12,470
你真的是拉拉吗?
Are you really gay?

998
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:18,350
到底有多拉拉呢 打几分?
Like,how gay are you,on a scale of--of 1 to gay?

999
01:02:18,350 --> 01:02:25,000
我是说 淋浴的是我男友 赤果果的性感撩人的男友
'Cause that's my boyfriend in--in the shower,my hot,hot,naked boyfriend,

1000
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,830
你到底有多拉?
and I... ho-how gay are you?

1001
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:29,200
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1002
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:35,950
我认识Mark很久了 我以后尽量不在他淋浴时这样了
It'S... I've known mark a while,and-- but I'll... I'll try not to do that again-- the naked in the shower thing.

1003
01:02:35,950 --> 01:02:38,740
还有你在门厅半裸的事
Or--or the you half-naked in the hallway thing?

1004
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:44,530
即便你是同性恋 但他不是 你又很辣
'Cause--'cause even if you really are gay,he--he's not,and--and you're hot.

1005
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:52,350
他现在看都不看我的胸部
he doesn't look at my boobs anymore.

1006
01:02:52,350 --> 01:02:59,190
以前不论我走到哪 他总是第一眼瞟到我的胸部
The first thing he used to look at when I walked in anywhere was my boobs.

1007
01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:03,410
自从遇到你 他就不这样了
He doesn't look anymore,not since he met you.

1008
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:05,480
明白了?
Okay? 

1009
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,040
明白
Okay.

1010
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:13,820
Shepherd
Shepherd.

1011
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:15,900
你真是神龙见首不见尾啊
You're a hard man to track down.

1012
01:03:15,910 --> 01:03:17,300
我很忙 你又不是不知道
I'm busy,as you know.

1013
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:19,160
是啊 打着西慈医院的主意呢
Yeah,scoping out mercy west.

1014
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,790
要弃我们于不顾了?
You planning on jumping ship?

1015
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:23,010
我觉得 作为朋友
'Cause I assume,as a friend,

1016
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:25,380
你应该透露点信息
you would tell me if there's anything I need to know.

1017
01:03:25,390 --> 01:03:26,420
谣言而已 Derek
Those are rumors,derek.

1018
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:28,500
谣言多着呢
There are a lot of rumors.

1019
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:30,450
Jennings不回我电话了
And jennings isn't answering my calls anymore.

1020
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:32,150
你为什么要打给他 Derel?
Why are you calling jennings,derek?

1021
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,960
我说过有什么信息 自然会告诉你
I told you I would fill you in when there was something to tell.

1022
01:03:34,970 --> 01:03:36,970
要是你想背着我干什么 至少替我...
If you feel the need to go behind my back,at least do me

1023
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:38,950
背着你?
behind your back?

1024
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,560
背着你?
Behind your back?

1025
01:03:40,570 --> 01:03:43,080
我可一直全心全意地支持你
I'm the one who's got your back.

1026
01:03:43,090 --> 01:03:45,450
别忘了这点
Don't you forget that.

1027
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:48,640
- Shepherd医生 - 嗯
- dr. Shepherd. - Yes.

1028
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:50,000
- 有时间吗? - 什么事?
- Do you have a minute? - For what?

1029
01:03:50,010 --> 01:03:51,050
一个有栓系脊髓的患儿
A kid with a tethered spinal cord.

1030
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:52,500
我彻夜难眠 突然灵光一现
I just sat up in the middle of the night,and I thought,

1031
01:03:52,510 --> 01:03:55,360
可能是栓系脊髓 但片子看不出来
tethered spinal cord,but you're not gonna see it on there.

1032
01:03:55,370 --> 01:03:57,310
还需要相关检查才能确诊
I need to run another test to confirm the diagnosis.

1033
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:58,250
栓系脊髓十分罕见
A tethered cord's pretty rare.

1034
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:00,010
- 他有脊柱裂的病史吗? - 没有
- Does he have a history of spina bifida? - No.

1035
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:02,020
那下背损伤 反射亢进呢?
Lower back lesions,hyperreflexia?

1036
01:04:02,030 --> 01:04:06,040
都没有 但当他弯伸脊髓时 疼痛会加重
No and no,but the pain is aggravated when he extends or flexes his spine.

1037
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:09,170
我知道你会说 核磁共振应该能显示出栓系脊髓
I know what you're gonna say-- that the tethered cord should've shown up on the M.R.I.

1038
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:10,320
但要是碰巧不显示呢?
But what if it didn't?

1039
01:04:10,330 --> 01:04:12,520
要是他需要的不是再做一次核磁
What if what this kid needs is not another M.R.I.

1040
01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:15,030
而是更清楚的CT脊髓成像?
But a much more specific C.T. Myelogram?

1041
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:17,240
也许吧 做个呗
Maybe. Order one.

1042
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:19,550
我不能 要是我做了 很可能会被炒
Well,see,I can't,because if I did,I'd get fired...

1043
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:21,710
我真的好喜欢我的工作
and I really... like my job.

1044
01:04:22,270 --> 01:04:23,910
主任不准你做?
Did the chief deny that request?

1045
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,790
吃了几次闭门羹了
several times.

1046
01:04:25,810 --> 01:04:27,860
你应该一开始就跟我说主任不让的
You shoulda led with the part about the chief.

1047
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:29,700
跟我来
Come on.

1048
01:04:29,710 --> 01:04:31,580
- 做得不错 - 又站起来了
- You're doing great. - You're up,girl.

1049
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:34,100
是啊 谁会知道站立都会这么困难呢
I know.Who would've thought standing could be so hard,right?

1050
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:35,730
- 你做得很棒 - 真不错
- You're doing awesome. - Awesome.

1051
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:37,320
- 放我下来 - 再坚持几秒
- Put me down. - Let's go a couple of more seconds.

1052
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:39,480
- 你做得... - 放我下来
- You're doing - put me down.

1053
01:04:39,490 --> 01:04:40,450
已经很不错了
that wagreaT.

1054
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:42,900
休息一下 我们再走 怎样?
Take a sec,and then go again for me,okay?

1055
01:04:42,910 --> 01:04:43,830
不
No.

1056
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:44,870
我明白 Clara
I know,clara.

1057
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,310
但困难才刚刚开始
But this is where the hard part begins.

1058
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:02,720
美梦先生
mcdreamy.

1059
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:04,130
你说什么?
I'm sorry?

1060
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:07,110
我终于知道大家为何叫你美梦先生了
I get it now-- the whole,you know,mcdreamy thing.

1061
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:08,500
以前不太明白
I didn't--I didn't get it before.

1062
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:11,830
但现在懂了
But now I get it.

1063
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:14,200
你知道这个外号 对吧?
You know they call you that,right?

1064
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:16,110
当然
Yes.

1065
01:05:17,310 --> 01:05:19,880
我正恋爱 别误会 以为我勾搭你
I'm involved,by the way,in case you thought that I was just coming on to you,

1066
01:05:19,890 --> 01:05:22,090
我可没有
because I was not.

1067
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:24,090
而且 我知道你结婚了
Plus,well,I heard that you got married.

1068
01:05:24,110 --> 01:05:25,440
恭喜
So congratulations.

1069
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:27,650
谢谢
Yes,thank you.

1070
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:30,890
你们不就在在医生休息室 用即时贴写了些虚情假意的东西吗
you wrote some hokey crap on a post-it note in the resident's lounge.

1071
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:33,700
不过 在你穿着晨礼服大汗淋漓
Sorry,but until you're sweating it out in a morning coat

1072
01:05:33,710 --> 01:05:36,290
在新娘穿着礼服向你走来之前
with a ball of white taffeta coming at you,

1073
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:37,080
抱歉 你还不能算已婚
you're not really married.

1074
01:05:37,090 --> 01:05:38,500
好吧
oh,okay.

1075
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:40,240
至少我有洞房花烛
Well,I've consummated mine.

1076
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:42,190
而且不止一次呢
I consummate mine all the time.

1077
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:44,100
你呢 Karev?
How's that going for you,karev?

1078
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:44,880
听她们八卦说起的
Girls talk.

1079
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:47,930
等你圆房了 再来评价我的即时贴婚礼吧
You might want to consider that the next time you judge my post-it.

1080
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:57,250
我还没哭过
I haven't cried yet.

1081
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:00,850
我用工作和性爱分心
I'm using work and sex as a distraction,

1082
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:03,620
效果好像还不错
and I think it's working for me.

1083
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:07,490
你有没有看见那个Amanda
Have you seen the girl--amanda

1084
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:11,860
整天坐在医院外的长椅上
sitting outside the hospital on that bench all day long,

1085
01:06:11,870 --> 01:06:13,430
- 每个... - 我想做爱
- every - I miss sex.

1086
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,920
想死了
Oh,I miss it so muchmuch.

1087
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,860
怎么了?
What?

1088
01:06:23,530 --> 01:06:26,950
- Mer... - 我很担心Clara
- Mer,wh - I'm worried about clara.

1089
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:27,870
她很消沉
She's depressed.

1090
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:30,090
好像比以前严重得多
But like a whole new level of depressed.

1091
01:06:30,110 --> 01:06:31,550
我不知该怎么办
I-I don't know what to do.

1092
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:32,660
你在说那个"酸橘汁腌鱼"?
Are you talking about ceviche?

1093
01:06:32,670 --> 01:06:36,950
那个... 天哪
That... oh,my god.

1094
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:38,920
你太恶劣了
That'S... that is so rude.

1095
01:06:38,930 --> 01:06:39,960
"酸橘汁腌鱼"?
Ceviche?

1096
01:06:39,970 --> 01:06:42,110
太...太...太恶劣了
That is so--that--it-- that's rude.

1097
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:44,810
太恶劣了
That--that-- that is so rude.

1098
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:50,730
还有人愿意让我得罪吗?
Well,anyone else I can offend?

1099
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:53,260
栓系脊髓?
A tethered spinal cord?

1100
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:56,000
一条脊髓线连到了尾骨上
One of the threads in his spinal cord is attached to his tailbone.

1101
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:59,260
一般脊髓下端都是游离的 现在连接尾骨
Normally the spinal cord is free at the end,but with it attached,

1102
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,380
你在生长发育时 就会牵拉脊髓
when you grew,it started pulling.

1103
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:02,880
于是产生剧痛
Thus the excruciating pain.

1104
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:05,650
你们能治好吗? 这病能治吗?
So can we fix it?Is it fixable?

1105
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:06,910
微创手术就行了
It's a microsurgery.

1106
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:09,800
我把连上的脊髓剪断 他就不会再痛了
I'll snip the tethered cord,and he'll be free of pain.

1107
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:15,490
她一般不这样
she's not normally like this.

1108
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:19,130
在这之前 她一直是个正常的妈妈
before all this,she was,like,a normal mom.

1109
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:22,710
Andy 现在她就是个正常妈妈
andy,this is a normal mom.

1110
01:07:28,910 --> 01:07:30,630
我们在等Swender医生吗?
are we waiting for dr. Swender?

1111
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:31,610
不是
No.

1112
01:07:31,620 --> 01:07:34,810
Swender医生把你移交给我
dr. Swender has handed you off to me.

1113
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:39,530
就你 第二年主治医生?
Wh-what are you,like,second year?

1114
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:42,630
第三年
Third.

1115
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:46,190
那也太... 我们是不是要呼下Swender医生?
That's,um... can we page dr. Swender or something?

1116
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:49,120
Stevens 这是好事
Stevens,this is a good thing.

1117
01:07:49,130 --> 01:07:50,450
是的
It is.

1118
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:52,510
癌灶依然存在
You still have cancer,

1119
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:56,410
但勾不起Swender医生的兴趣了
but not enough to interest dr. Swender anymore.

1120
01:07:56,420 --> 01:07:58,010
这可是件好事
It is a good thing.

1121
01:07:58,020 --> 01:08:01,950
你是说我的癌资历太浅?
You're saying I have J.V. Cancer?

1122
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:04,620
我是说你的癌灶大大减小
I'm saying your mets have shrunk way down,

1123
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:05,780
而且没有新发
and there are no new ones.

1124
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:08,650
给你的方案相当有效
Your protocol is working very effectively.

1125
01:08:10,510 --> 01:08:11,770
Stevens
Stevens.

1126
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:14,720
这消息好得不能再好了
This is about as good as the news gets.

1127
01:08:15,430 --> 01:08:18,420
那...现在该怎么办?
Um... so what-- what now?

1128
01:08:18,430 --> 01:08:22,000
目前 我们还是继续在中央静脉管 注射白介素2
We're gonna use the port in your chest to continue with your I.L.-2 regimen for now.

1129
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:26,110
实时关注病情的进展
And we'll continue monitoring the progression of your disease

1130
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:29,400
每隔三或六个月 做一次核素扫描
with pet-scans every three to six months.

1131
01:08:29,410 --> 01:08:32,560
这有没有什么时间表 或是...?
Is there,uh,some kind of timeline on this or...

1132
01:08:32,570 --> 01:08:36,430
你妻子得了癌症 Karev医生
your wife is living  with cancer,dr. Karev.

1133
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:38,510
而且现在癌灶没有扩大
Right now the cancer has stopped growing.

1134
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:43,110
对于侵袭性如此强的癌症 这可是不小的成就
With a cancer this aggressive,that's pretty stunning success.

1135
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:44,940
不可能有什么时间表
There's no timeline.

1136
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:48,090
我们只能...仔细观察
There's just... we watch it.

1137
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:49,500
耐心等待
We wait.

1138
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,890
希望它不会复发
We hope it doesn't start to grow again.

1139
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:58,690
就这样?
That's it?

1140
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:01,370
就这样
that's it.

1141
01:09:04,010 --> 01:09:08,070
第37天
DAY 37

1142
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:11,700
我看到胫骨前肌收缩
I see contractions in the anterior tibialus.

1143
01:09:11,710 --> 01:09:14,640
好的 那是神经根 不是神经纤维
okay.That's the nerve root,not the filum.

1144
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:17,820
请给我双极管和微创剪刀
Bipolars and the microscissors,please.

1145
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:23,010
你想切吗?
Want to make the cut?

1146
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:24,790
不 没这个必要
No.I-I don't need to.

1147
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:27,090
要不是你
You know,without you,this kid probably would've been

1148
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:30,580
这个病人可能一直会有慢性疼痛 并对止痛药上瘾
a chronic pain patient and possibly addicted to pain meds.

1149
01:09:30,590 --> 01:09:33,250
他的未来全靠你
He owes his entire future to you.

1150
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:36,300
应该由你来切
You should make the cut.

1151
01:09:38,730 --> 01:09:40,530
好吗?
Okay?

1152
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:45,430
好的
Okay.

1153
01:09:46,030 --> 01:09:48,270
置入剪刀
Put the scissor in.

1154
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:55,060
就是这样 做得不错
TherE.Nicely done.

1155
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:01,860
Clara Grey医生说你还是不愿做理疗
clara,dr. Grey says you're still refusing your physical therapy.

1156
01:10:02,410 --> 01:10:04,270
我知道这很困难
Now I understand it's hard.

1157
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:06,330
但你必须得锻炼肌肉力量
But you have to rk these muscles now,

1158
01:10:06,350 --> 01:10:10,060
要不它们会萎缩 难以恢复正常功能
or they will atrophy and they'll heal incorrectly.

1159
01:10:10,690 --> 01:10:12,740
Clara 你必须迈出第一步
Clara,you gotta do the work.

1160
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:16,000
现在就得迈出第一步
You know,you've just got to do the work now.

1161
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:23,920
我知道生不如死的感觉
clara,I know what it is to not want to live,

1162
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:27,660
我也知道失去一切的痛苦
to wish that you'd died,to lose everything...

1163
01:10:27,670 --> 01:10:30,820
更知道要告诉母亲 有多么困难
to not want to... call your mother.

1164
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:33,660
相信与否 这一切我都感同深受
Believe it or not,I know exactly what that is.

1165
01:10:33,870 --> 01:10:36,350
我曾经也这样消沉
I have been there.

1166
01:10:36,370 --> 01:10:38,580
但现在又重振旗鼓
But I am back now.

1167
01:10:40,550 --> 01:10:44,330
尽管看似毫无可能 最终...
and as impossible as it felt,eventually...

1168
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:46,220
我重振旗鼓
I came back.

1169
01:10:46,230 --> 01:10:47,200
你也可以
And so can you.

1170
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:50,750
但你得迈出第一步
But you have got to do the work.

1171
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:02,470
你得把她送去精神科
you have to get her admitted to psych.

1172
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:03,560
委托给精神科?
Committed?

1173
01:11:03,570 --> 01:11:04,720
你希望我委托给精神科?
You want me to have her committed?

1174
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:07,540
我们已无能为力 你得做个决定
There's nothing more we can do.You have to make that call.

1175
01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:09,700
人们叫你"酸橘汁腌鱼"
People are calling you "ceviche.

1176
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:11,770
- Grey医生 你得... - 我的意思是...
- dr. Grey,you - I mean,that's,you know...

1177
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:16,040
你不能出院后还让人叫你"酸橘汁腌鱼"
you can't go out like that,clara,with people calling you ceviche.

1178
01:11:16,050 --> 01:11:17,150
"酸橘汁腌鱼"?
Ceviche?

1179
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:18,900
是道菜
Yeah,it--it's a meal.

1180
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:21,570
可能是秘鲁菜吧
It'S... peruvian,I think.

1181
01:11:22,430 --> 01:11:25,100
就是剁碎的鱼肉
I... it's chopped up fish.

1182
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:39,090
真糟糕 对吧?
that is really horrible,isn't it?

1183
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:44,210
是啊 太糟糕了
it is. It'S... it's--it's horrible.

1184
01:11:53,910 --> 01:11:57,940
第39天
DAY 39

1185
01:11:58,330 --> 01:12:00,080
我没料到会这样
I didn't expect this.

1186
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:03,690
当人们说"晚期癌症"时 意味着你命不久矣
They say "cancer," they say "stage iv," you expect to die.

1187
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:06,550
接着你开始想 没准我能战胜它
And then you start thinking,well,maybe I can kick it.

1188
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:09,100
也许在我身上会发生奇迹
Maybe I'll be the miracle.

1189
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:12,500
是啊 你就是奇迹
Well,you are the miracle.

1190
01:12:12,510 --> 01:12:14,770
癌症依然伴随着我
I'm still living with cancer.

1191
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:17,130
我只是...
You know,I just...

1192
01:12:17,650 --> 01:12:19,510
没料到会这样
you don't expect that.

1193
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,640
那不是George救的那女孩吗?
Isn't that the girl that george saved?

1194
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:26,550
Amanda
Amanda.

1195
01:12:26,570 --> 01:12:28,110
是的
Yeah.

1196
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:29,660
她在这儿干吗?
What is she doing here?

1197
01:12:29,670 --> 01:12:33,900
她整天都坐在那
Oh,she sits there,every day,all day.

1198
01:12:34,790 --> 01:12:36,400
上帝啊
Oh,for god sakes.

1199
01:12:36,410 --> 01:12:39,190
你要...
Where--where what

1200
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:42,570
起来
get up.

1201
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:44,340
我说真的 起来
I mean it,get up.

1202
01:12:44,350 --> 01:12:46,490
起 来
Get up.

1203
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,280
去好好生活
now go get a life.

1204
01:12:53,230 --> 01:12:55,250
我做不到
I can'T.

1205
01:12:57,090 --> 01:12:59,340
George生前是个外科医生
George was a surgeon.

1206
01:12:59,350 --> 01:13:01,970
他的梦想就是能救死扶伤
He had a purpose.He wanted to save lives.

1207
01:13:01,990 --> 01:13:04,200
但现在他没机会了
And now he doesn't get the chance.

1208
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:09,490
他再也没机会做什么了 但你可以
Now he doesn't get the chance to do anything anymore,but you do.

1209
01:13:09,930 --> 01:13:12,440
你可以去医学院
You could go to medical school,you know?

1210
01:13:12,450 --> 01:13:13,900
你可以和朋友一起消磨时光
You uld hang out with your freakin' friends.

1211
01:13:13,910 --> 01:13:15,360
我不管你做什么
I don't care what you do.

1212
01:13:15,380 --> 01:13:20,050
但去做点什么 因为你有生命!
Just go do something with your life,because you have one.

1213
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:21,190
你还活着
You lived.

1214
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:23,250
你还活着 但George不在了
You lived and george didn'T.

1215
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:24,590
我知道
And I know.

1216
01:13:27,450 --> 01:13:35,340
我...知道这种恐惧无助的感觉
I... I know... that that feels horrible and shocking... and terrifying.

1217
01:13:37,070 --> 01:13:39,060
但起码你活着
But you lived.

1218
01:13:40,830 --> 01:13:44,260
所以放手去生活吧
So go live your freakin' life.

1219
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:50,170
我不知道该怎么做
I... I don't know how.

1220
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:52,210
没人知道
Nobody does.

1221
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:54,650
没人知道要怎么做
Nobody knows how.

1222
01:13:55,630 --> 01:13:59,800
但就算是为了George 你得去摸索
But god,have enough respect for george to figure it out.

1223
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:01,980
如果我再看见你坐在这里无所事事
'Cause if I see you sitting on this bench ever again,

1224
01:14:01,990 --> 01:14:05,090
我会狠狠地收拾你
I will kick your ass from here to sunday.

1225
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:24,490
我不能再跟Bailey的病例了
I can't get back on bailey's service.

1226
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:25,690
她看都不看我一眼
I mean,she's still not even looking at me.

1227
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:26,560
给她点时间
You just gotta give it time.

1228
01:14:26,570 --> 01:14:28,410
她和O'malley很亲 而且工作...
You know,she was close with o'malley,and she's working--

1229
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:29,940
但问题是 这根本与O'malley无关
yeah,but the thing is,it's not even about o'malley.

1230
01:14:29,950 --> 01:14:31,890
她是因为酸橘汁腌鱼而生我的气
I mean,she's mad at me about ceviche.

1231
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:33,150
别再这么说了
you gotta stop that.

1232
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:34,900
酸橘汁腌鱼?
Ceviche?

1233
01:14:34,910 --> 01:14:36,250
呃...是个病人
Oh,it's a--it's a patient.

1234
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:37,720
船难的受害人
A boating accident victim.

1235
01:14:37,730 --> 01:14:40,240
她想给她起个海鲜菜肴的名字
She thinks that it's okay to call her a seafood dish.

1236
01:14:40,250 --> 01:14:41,960
- 这是道美味的秘鲁菜 - 我是说 这没问题吧?
- It's a delicious peruvian dish. - I mean,is that is that okay?

1237
01:14:41,970 --> 01:14:44,110
有点阴暗
Well,it's pretty dark.

1238
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:45,560
不是吧 我阴暗?
Oh,come on.I'm dark?

1239
01:14:45,570 --> 01:14:47,710
我可没在别人睡觉时试图掐死她
I'm not the one gog around choking people in their sleep.

1240
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:49,600
什么?
What?

1241
01:14:57,350 --> 01:14:59,320
太快了?

1242
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:07,730
我不想在别人睡觉时掐死她
I'm not the guy going around choking people in their sleep.

1243
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:09,620
- 我知道 - 我当时做了噩梦
- I know. - It was a dream.

1244
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:14,260
我想不起来是什么梦了
I... I can't remember what I was dreaming about,

1245
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:18,810
但我当时是为了救自己一命
but... I was trying to save my own life.

1246
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:23,520
我不想伤害你
I wasn't trying to hurt you.

1247
01:15:26,990 --> 01:15:29,280
我只是...
I was...

1248
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:31,870
我是在争取自己的生命
I was fighting for my life.

把衣服脱了 上床 抱着我
Get undressed,get into bed and hold me.

我不知道你在生什么气
I don't know what you're so mad about a

1277
01:17:36,190 --> 01:17:38,740
也不知道你在害怕什么 因为你根本不愿和我说话
nd I don't know what you're scared of because you won't talk to me.

1278
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:42,810

我需要你... 求你了

你曾死在我的怀里

You freakin' died and then you left instructions that I wasn't allowed to save your life.

你想知道我在怕什么?
You want to know what I'm scared of?

我什么都害怕!
