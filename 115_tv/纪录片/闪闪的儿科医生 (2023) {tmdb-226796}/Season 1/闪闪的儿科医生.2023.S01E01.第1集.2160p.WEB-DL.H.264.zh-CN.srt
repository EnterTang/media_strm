<i>Deep fried shrimp,</i>

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,001
<i>I never had lobster.</i>

3
00:00:11,067 --> 00:00:12,801
What? They boil 'em
or grill 'em?

4
00:00:12,867 --> 00:00:14,767
Which one's better?

5
00:00:14,834 --> 00:00:16,700
Ah, just get 'em both.

6
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,867
And I know I need
a strawberry malt.

7
00:00:18,934 --> 00:00:22,067
And then there's those chocolate
donuts, they come in a box?

8

No, I don't need
none of that.

14
00:00:36,734 --> 00:00:39,001
One last thing
to think about.

15
00:00:39,067 --> 00:00:41,101
<i>(warden)</i>
<i>After I read</i>

17
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:45,168
<i>Might wanna take some time</i>

18
00:00:45,234 --> 00:00:47,700
<i>and think about what you wanna</i>

19

<i>(prisoner)</i>
<i>Yo, Clarence?</i>
<i>You hear that?</i>

20
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:57,834
<i>A spiritual advisor</i>
<i>of my choice?</i>

21
00:00:57,901 --> 00:01:00,201
Don't matter.
You're going to hell anyway.

22
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:01,300
You think I'll get
another stay?

23
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:02,867
You should.

24
00:01:02,934 --> 00:01:06,168
Supreme Court says it ain't
right to kill retards.

25
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:07,134
<i>(guard)</i>
<i>Cut the chatter.</i>

26
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:09,667
Exercise time.

27
00:01:25,967 --> 00:01:28,001
Be back in an hour.

28
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:30,300
(guard)
Enjoy.

29
00:01:55,934 --> 00:01:57,934
Why did you hit me
so many times, Clarence?

30
00:01:58,001 --> 00:01:59,333
You know why.

31
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,067
You could've stopped.

32
00:02:01,134 --> 00:02:02,201
You stabbed me
in the back, man.

33
00:02:02,268 --> 00:02:03,567
I never...

34
00:02:03,634 --> 00:02:05,634
You couldn't fight fair?
Like you did!

35
00:02:07,134 --> 00:02:08,667
I had a wife
and three kids.

36
00:02:08,734 --> 00:02:10,867
You are a sick bastard!
Open the door!

37
00:02:10,934 --> 00:02:13,801
Open the door.
Hey!

38
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:15,667
<i>What did I ever</i>
<i>do to you, man?</i>

39
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:17,400
<i>(man)</i>
<i>How old are you, son?</i>

40
00:02:17,467 --> 00:02:19,433
<i>I was just minding</i>
<i>my own business.</i>

41
00:02:22,367 --> 00:02:23,433
<i>How could you do me</i>
<i>like that?</i>

42
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,467
<i>I'm your brother.</i>

43
00:02:24,534 --> 00:02:25,333
<i>I never did you.</i>

44
00:02:38,967 --> 00:02:41,934


45
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:35,667
You can't go in there.

46
00:03:37,234 --> 00:03:39,634
Who are you?
And why are you wearing a tie?

47
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,934
I'm Dr. Cuddy's new assistant.

48
00:03:42,001 --> 00:03:43,901
Can I tell her
what it's regarding?

49
00:03:43,967 --> 00:03:46,001
Yes, I would like to know
why she gets a secretary

50
00:03:46,067 --> 00:03:47,700
and I don't.

51
00:03:47,767 --> 00:03:49,534
I'm her assistant,
not her secretary.

52
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,333
I graduated
from Rutgers.

53
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,268
Hmm, I didn't know
they had a secretarial school.

54
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,700
Well, I hope you
took some classes

55
00:03:55,767 --> 00:03:57,734
in Sexual Harassment Law.

56
00:03:57,801 --> 00:03:59,901
Does the word ka-ching,
mean anything to you?

57
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:01,367
I'm going in now.

58
00:04:01,433 --> 00:04:04,234
Dr. House, we are in
the middle of a meeting.

59
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,667
What's with hiring
a male secretary?

60
00:04:06,734 --> 00:04:08,400
JDate not working out?

61
00:04:08,467 --> 00:04:09,801
He is cute.
Be careful.

62
00:04:09,867 --> 00:04:11,500
<i>She's not like you.</i>

63
00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:13,168
She can't just walk
into a bar

64
00:04:13,234 --> 00:04:14,801
and pick up her soul mate
in 20 minutes.

65
00:04:14,867 --> 00:04:16,534
I met Mark at a fund-raiser
that happened to be held at--

66
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,300
You met me
at a strip club.

67
00:04:18,367 --> 00:04:19,734
You are the worst
two dollars I ever spent.

68
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,268
We'll catch up later.

69
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,600
Stacy, it's House.
I know you can handle it.

70
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:25,134
Nothing to handle.

71
00:04:25,201 --> 00:04:26,767
He obviously
wants to talk to you alone.

72
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,201
<i>If you have a problem working</i>
<i>with Stacy,</i>

73
00:04:32,268 --> 00:04:33,333
<i>you should've said so.</i>

74
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,834
What was I supposed to do?

75
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:37,034
Ask her to leave?
That's just rude.

76
00:04:37,101 --> 00:04:40,367
Death-row guy.
I want the case.

77
00:04:40,433 --> 00:04:42,400
How do you even
know about him?

78
00:04:42,467 --> 00:04:44,268
You don't have access
to the hospital's main frame.

79
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:47,268
No, but "PartyPants" does.

80
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:50,168
You stole my password?

81
00:04:50,234 --> 00:04:53,001
Hardly counts as stealing.
Pretty obvious choice.

82
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:56,801
Well, I have already assigned
"death-row guy" to Dr. Nolo.

83
00:04:56,867 --> 00:04:57,801
Nolo?

84
00:04:57,867 --> 00:04:59,333
Well, I--

85
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,001
I don't wanna say anything bad
about another doctor.

86
00:05:02,067 --> 00:05:03,367
Especially a useless drunk.

87
00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:05,201
You are addicted to pain pills.

88
00:05:05,268 --> 00:05:08,034
But I'm not useless.
Tell Nolo I'm taking over.

89
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:10,367
Dr. Nolo is a board
certified cardiologist.

90
00:05:10,433 --> 00:05:13,101
Well, good, I'm sure he'll
explore all the usual options

91
00:05:13,168 --> 00:05:15,433
for why a guy's heart
starts beating so fast

92
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,034
it pumps out air
instead of blood.

93
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:20,534
Wait a second,
there are no usual options.

94
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,300
How badly do you want this?

95
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:28,201
I will give you two more
clinic hours this week.

96
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,534
Don't bend over for the soap.

97
00:05:37,467 --> 00:05:39,433
Just the heart, or the patient
have any other complaints?

98
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,467
Patient's not talking
to anybody.

99
00:05:41,534 --> 00:05:43,134
Where are we going?

100
00:05:43,201 --> 00:05:44,500
You are going to the clinic
for two hours.

101
00:05:44,567 --> 00:05:45,967
Me? Why?

102
00:05:46,034 --> 00:05:48,367
Talk to Cuddy.

103
00:05:48,433 --> 00:05:50,234
She's got me going
to Mercer State Prison,

104
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,901
Capital Sentences Unit.
I don't know.

105
00:05:51,967 --> 00:05:53,168
Aren't there better ways
to spend our time?

106
00:05:53,234 --> 00:05:54,734
Good question.

107
00:05:54,801 --> 00:05:56,333
What makes a person deserving?

108
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,234
Is a man who cheats on his wife

109
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,934
more deserving than a man
who kills his wife?

110
00:06:00,001 --> 00:06:02,300
Uh, yeah, actually.
He is.

111
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:04,467
What about a child molester?

112
00:06:04,534 --> 00:06:05,867
<i>Certainly not a good guy,</i>

113
00:06:05,934 --> 00:06:07,600
but he didn't kill anybody.

114
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,634
Maybe he can get
antibiotics, but no MRIs.

115
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,667
What about you?

116
00:06:12,734 --> 00:06:15,168
What medical care should you be
denied for being a car thief?

117
00:06:15,234 --> 00:06:18,201
Tell you what, the three
of you work on a list.

118
00:06:18,268 --> 00:06:19,901
What medical treatments
a person loses

119
00:06:19,967 --> 00:06:21,333
based on the crime
they committed?

120
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,201
I'll review it
when I get back.

121
00:06:27,268 --> 00:06:29,268
Your patient shanked one inmate
his first month here.

122
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,067
Broke another one's neck,

123
00:06:31,134 --> 00:06:32,834
nearly decapitated
one of my guards.

124
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:35,433
Relax, I got a great
bedside manner.

125
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,767
<i>(Warden) </i>
<i>Too dangerous to house him</i>
<i>in the infirmary.</i>

126
00:06:37,834 --> 00:06:40,201
You don't have to worry.
We've taken every precaution.

127
00:06:40,268 --> 00:06:41,767
I had my men clear
from the cell

128
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:44,801
all pens paper clips
and staplers.

129

<i>(Warden)</i>
<i>Any supplies that might</i>

<i>Open her up!</i>

<i>For your visit, we've got him</i>
<i>cuffed and shackled.</i>

132
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,767
And yet,
you're staying out there.

133
00:07:05,834 --> 00:07:08,634
Uh, you're gonna have
to give me that.

134
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,567
Wouldn't want anybody
to get hurt.

135
00:07:12,634 --> 00:07:15,034
Hi, I'm Dr. Cameron.
Hi.

136
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,634
How you feeling?

137
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,201
A little cough.
No big deal.

138
00:07:18,268 --> 00:07:20,867
Okay, then what
are you doing here?

139
00:07:20,934 --> 00:07:22,367
I just got a job
at the University.

140
00:07:22,433 --> 00:07:24,201
They need a health clearance.

141
00:07:24,268 --> 00:07:25,734
Apparently,
I'm a little anemic,

142
00:07:25,801 --> 00:07:26,834
so they made me get
some more tests.

143
00:07:26,901 --> 00:07:28,201
Any family history
of anemia?

144
00:07:28,268 --> 00:07:29,634
Not that I know of.

145
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,967
My mom died of cancer
when I was a kid.

146
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,367
My dad's heart gave out
a couple of years ago.

147
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:36,500
Brothers and sisters?

148
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:38,734
I'm afraid it's
a short family history.

149
00:07:38,801 --> 00:07:41,067
That's it.
I had a husband once.

150
00:07:41,134 --> 00:07:44,567
But it didn't stick.

151
00:07:44,634 --> 00:07:47,234
My tests should be back.

152
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,834
Probably in that file.
Probably.

153
00:07:53,967 --> 00:07:55,634
Is everything okay?

154
00:07:59,101 --> 00:08:01,101
Did you redo the x-ray?
Twice.

155
00:08:01,168 --> 00:08:06,134
Well, you don't need
a consult.

156
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:08,600
You know the diagnosis.

157
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:12,500
All she has is a cough.

158
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:22,201
Bluish tinge
to the fingernails, lips.

159
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:24,001
He's hypoxic.

160
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:25,500
What's that mean?

161
00:08:25,567 --> 00:08:27,700
It means he's not getting
enough oxygen.

162
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:29,767
You know how people say
you can't live without love?

163
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:33,567
Well, oxygen's
even more important.

164
00:08:36,534 --> 00:08:38,534
<i>He's got fluid</i>
<i>in his lungs.</i>

165
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,234
Breathing rate of 50.

166
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,967
He needs to be incubated
and put on a respirator.

167
00:08:42,034 --> 00:08:43,600
Don't have a respirator.

168
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:45,067
Well, you better get one
in about an hour

169
00:08:45,134 --> 00:08:46,500
or you're gonna lose him.

170
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,268
I'll make out a requisition.

171
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,433
State's already sentenced
this man to die.

172
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,734
I think the State was a tad more
specific about how.

173
00:08:53,801 --> 00:08:55,500
This is Dr. Gregory House.

174
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:57,333
I need an ambulance to pick up
at Mercer State Prison.

175
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,500
Wasted call, my men
will stop them at the gate.

176
00:08:59,567 --> 00:09:02,667
No way a death row inmate
leaves my prison.

177
00:09:02,734 --> 00:09:04,467
At least not
through the front doors.

178
00:09:11,934 --> 00:09:13,734
You work fast.

179

So do you.

180
00:09:15,134 --> 00:09:16,767
Is that a shot?
Yeah.

181
00:09:16,834 --> 00:09:18,433
It was easy.

182
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,901
Once I convinced the clerk
to take it to Judge Markham,

183
00:09:20,967 --> 00:09:22,667
she's a sucker for
Eighth Amendment arguments.

184

Anyway, we're walking.

202

Somebody left this
on my chair.

203
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:05,367
It's clever 'cause it forces me
to either deal with the file,

204
00:10:05,433 --> 00:10:06,767
or never sit down again.

205
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:08,700
Cindy Kramer.
I told her you'd see her.

206
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,700
You shouldn't have
told her that.

207
00:10:10,767 --> 00:10:11,734
She's got metastatic squamous
cell lung cancer.

208
00:10:11,801 --> 00:10:13,067
Six months tops.

209
00:10:13,134 --> 00:10:14,500
Have you even looked
at the x-ray?

210
00:10:14,567 --> 00:10:17,934
No. Just guessing.
It's a new game.

211
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:19,700
If I'm wrong,
she wins a stuffed bear.

212
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:21,234
A spot on an x-ray doesn't
necessarily mean

213
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,767
that she's terminal.

214
00:10:22,834 --> 00:10:25,700
I love children.
So filled with hope.

215
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:28,400
It could be pneumonia.
It could be sarcoidosis.

216
00:10:28,467 --> 00:10:31,300
Could be if she didn't already
have swollen hilar lymph nodes

217
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:33,134
on the other lung.

218
00:10:33,201 --> 00:10:35,767
Could we at least brainstorm
for other ideas?

219
00:10:43,634 --> 00:10:47,101
Thank you.

220
00:10:47,168 --> 00:10:49,067
I still think pneumonia
and sarcoidosis.

221
00:10:49,134 --> 00:10:52,333
But we should check
for tuberculosis

222
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,734
and definitely rule out
congestive heart failure.

223

Exactly.

225
00:11:02,001 --> 00:11:04,534
Personally, I think
it's all just new age crap,

226
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,534
but from your tear-filled,
puppy-dog eyes,

227
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,801
I think I made my point.

228
00:11:08,867 --> 00:11:10,801
Now go tell Cindy
whatever-her-name-is

229
00:11:10,867 --> 00:11:13,367
that she's dying.

230
00:11:13,433 --> 00:11:17,001
Tachycardia, pulmonary edema.
Likely suspects?

231
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:19,034
The death-row guy?

232

That's who you're working on
instead of Cindy?

233
00:11:22,134 --> 00:11:24,934
God, I've got to learn
not to beat around the bush.

234
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:27,268
By dying, I meant,
no matter what we do,

235
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,734
very, very soon

236

<i>she's going to be dead.</i>

237
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,034
That's still too subtle?

238
00:11:32,101 --> 00:11:34,767
I took an oath
to do no harm.

239

Yeah, well it's not like they
make you sign it or anything.

We cure your patient,
he goes back to death row.

241
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:41,867
He goes back to death row,
they kill him.

00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,134
It doesn't mean
we've stopped loving you.

314
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,634
<i>(House)</i>
<i>Now go outside and play.</i>

315
00:14:39,701 --> 00:14:44,067
Get daddy some smokes
and an arterial blood gas test.

316
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,200
Wow.

317
00:14:57,267 --> 00:14:59,867
That was impressive.

318
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:01,567
Okay, what number
am I thinking of?

319
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,467
Are you trying
to get me fired?

320
00:15:03,534 --> 00:15:04,867
If you didn't want
me working here,

321
00:15:04,933 --> 00:15:06,833
why didn't you just say so?

322
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,034
I just don't want you working
right here, in my office.

323
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,034
But anywhere else
in the building is fine.

324
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,301
It's a really big hospital.
I'm a lawyer, you're a jerk.

325
00:15:13,367 --> 00:15:14,967
There's gonna
be some overlap.

326
00:15:15,034 --> 00:15:16,267
God, I hope that was
a euphemism.

327
00:15:16,334 --> 00:15:17,900
Cuddy just reamed me.

328
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:19,467
I hope that one means
what I think it means.

329
00:15:19,534 --> 00:15:21,167
For trusting you.

330
00:15:21,234 --> 00:15:23,034
She figured when she hired me
she'd at least have someone

331
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,467
you couldn't walk all over.

332
00:15:24,534 --> 00:15:27,100
The number was six
by the way.

333
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:29,967
I need to know,
can I trust you?

334
00:15:30,034 --> 00:15:33,900
If I hadn't lied to you about
Cuddy's approval,

335
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:35,768
my patient would be dead.

336
00:15:35,867 --> 00:15:38,501
Great.

337
00:15:39,967 --> 00:15:41,800
Now I know.

338
00:15:41,867 --> 00:15:43,668
Now we can work together.

339
00:15:46,601 --> 00:15:49,933
I'm drawing some blood
from your femoral artery.

340
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,100
From my what?

341
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:53,933
Runs through your groin.

342
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,100
You think you're gonna stick me
in the jewels with that?

343
00:15:57,167 --> 00:15:58,734
It's really close
to your thigh.

344
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,267
Technically, at this point,

345
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,900
it seems like your jewels are

346
00:16:01,967 --> 00:16:03,534
more for display
purposes anyway.

347
00:16:03,601 --> 00:16:05,234
Hold up, hold up, give me some
painkillers or something.

348
00:16:05,301 --> 00:16:07,134
Tough guy like you
don't need 'em.

349
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,668
Forget that.
Numb me up, man.

350
00:16:17,134 --> 00:16:19,100
<i>You got some gang ink?</i>

351
00:16:19,167 --> 00:16:20,401
Let me see that.

352
00:16:20,467 --> 00:16:22,467
It's a Native American symbol.

353
00:16:22,534 --> 00:16:23,933
It means the force of life.

354
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,401
That's what you tell
all these white dudes

355
00:16:27,467 --> 00:16:28,900
so they let you play doctor?

356
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:31,933
Yep, got 'em all fooled.

357
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
For real, how a brother like you
go from gang bangin'

358
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:35,833
into wearing that white coat?

359
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,434
How's a brother like you
go from loving a woman

360
00:16:37,501 --> 00:16:40,034
to punching her skull in?

361
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:44,567
Bitch stepped out.

362
00:16:49,701 --> 00:16:51,234
<i>(Foreman)</i>
<i>Sorry about that.</i>

363
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:53,034
Guess I didn't use
enough lidocaine.

364
00:16:55,601 --> 00:16:58,067
Blood gas came back
with a pH of 7.28

365
00:16:58,134 --> 00:16:59,668
and decreased HCO3.

366
00:16:59,734 --> 00:17:01,167
Which means two things.

367
00:17:01,234 --> 00:17:02,668
Most importantly,

368
00:17:02,734 --> 00:17:04,134
Cameron was wrong
about the bi-carb.

369
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,134
<i>And less significantly,</i>

370
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,933
we have a new symptom.

371
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,867
Anion gap acidosis.

372
00:17:12,933 --> 00:17:15,867
Who's chubby?

373
00:17:15,933 --> 00:17:17,668
Come on,
pretend he loves puppies.

374
00:17:17,734 --> 00:17:19,534
Pretend he's a human being.
What do ya got?

375
00:17:19,601 --> 00:17:22,334
I think we should
reconsider drugs.

376
00:17:22,401 --> 00:17:23,900
He already tested negative.

377
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,000
That's why I said
"reconsider."

378
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:26,501
<i>Back in juvie,</i>

379
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:28,401
I cut up oregano
and sold it as pot.

380
00:17:28,467 --> 00:17:30,501
Is that how you put yourself
through med school?

381
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:31,668
What if Clarence thought
he was taking heroin,

382
00:17:31,734 --> 00:17:33,134
but it was something else?

383
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,134
What something else could lead
to anion gap acidosis?

384
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,167
MUDPILES.

385
00:17:37,234 --> 00:17:38,734
You don't have to ask,

386
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,634
just wash your hands before
you come back.

387
00:17:40,701 --> 00:17:42,434
Methanol, Uremia, Diabetes...

388
00:17:42,501 --> 00:17:45,833
Oh, it's a mnemonic.
That makes sense too.

389
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,367
Paraldehyde, INH,
Lactic acid--

390
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:48,601
Rewind.

391
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:49,634
INH?

392
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:50,933
Yahtzee.

393
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,167
Drugs for tuberculosis.

394
00:17:53,234 --> 00:17:55,434
Nearly a quarter of the prison
population in infected with TB.

395
00:17:55,501 --> 00:17:57,334
Clever entrepreneur
like Foreman here,

396
00:17:57,401 --> 00:17:58,534
<i>chops up his meds</i>

397
00:17:58,601 --> 00:18:00,234
passes it off as heroin.

398
00:18:00,301 --> 00:18:02,401
INH poisoning would explain
all the symptoms.

399
00:18:02,467 --> 00:18:04,167
Who wants to head over
to the prison

400
00:18:04,234 --> 00:18:05,434
and find Clarence's
secret stash?

401
00:18:09,034 --> 00:18:10,301
Fine. I'll do it.

402
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:12,367
Great.
Chase it is.

403
00:18:12,434 --> 00:18:15,467
I assume you have a reason
beyond wanting

404
00:18:15,534 --> 00:18:18,134
to make me
completely miserable?

405
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,933
You got a prettier mouth.

406
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,034
Better chance the inmates
will open up to you.

407
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,800
<i>(man)</i>
<i>Perhaps I'll come out</i>
<i>looking just as monstrous.</i>

408
00:18:24,867 --> 00:18:26,601
<i>I mean, isn't that</i>
<i>what I deserve?</i>

409
00:18:26,668 --> 00:18:30,601
<i>John, it wasn't your fault.</i>

410
00:18:30,668 --> 00:18:32,534
<i>If your father hadn't</i>
<i>slipped you those drugs,</i>

411
00:18:32,601 --> 00:18:35,567
<i>you'd have never done</i>
<i>what you did.</i>

412
00:18:35,634 --> 00:18:36,833
<i>I still might do.</i>

413
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,933
The man's in a coma.

414
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,567
He didn't mind.

415
00:18:42,634 --> 00:18:44,301
I asked.

416
00:18:44,367 --> 00:18:45,900
You're getting crumbs
all over him.

417
00:18:45,967 --> 00:18:47,267
Why do you think
they put TVs

418
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,833
in coma patients'
rooms anyway?

419
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,701
Some people think
they can still hear.

420
00:18:51,768 --> 00:18:55,768
So leave 'em a radio.
His eyes are closed.

421
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:58,668
Who thinks they can see?

422
00:18:58,734 --> 00:19:01,000
Do you know why people

423
00:19:01,067 --> 00:19:02,734
are nice to other people?

424
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,234
Oh, I know this one.
Um, because people are good,

425
00:19:05,301 --> 00:19:07,267
<i>decent and caring.</i>

426
00:19:07,334 --> 00:19:10,301
Either that or
people are cowards.

427
00:19:10,367 --> 00:19:12,067
<i>If I'm mean to you,</i>
<i>then you'll be mean to me.</i>

428
00:19:12,134 --> 00:19:13,900
Mutually assured destruction.

429
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:17,301
Exactly.
You gonna eat these chips?

430
00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:21,200
You gonna get
to your point?

431
00:19:22,701 --> 00:19:24,267
You need people
to like you.

432
00:19:24,334 --> 00:19:26,601
I don't care
if people like me.

433
00:19:26,668 --> 00:19:30,434
Yes, but you need people
to like you

434
00:19:30,501 --> 00:19:31,800
because you need people.

435
00:19:31,867 --> 00:19:33,100
<i>Unless you think you can get</i>

436
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:35,467
the next court order yourself.

437
00:19:35,534 --> 00:19:39,534
If Stacy can't trust you,
you can't use her.

438
00:19:44,034 --> 00:19:46,501
And that's not even dealing
with the greater agenda

439
00:19:46,567 --> 00:19:49,134
of getting her
to dump her husband

440
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,100
and fall in love with you
all over again.

441
00:19:52,167 --> 00:19:55,067
I know you're friends with her,
but there is a code.

442
00:19:55,134 --> 00:19:57,601
Bros before hoes, man.

443
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,567
Crap.

444
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:03,601
What is it?

445
00:20:03,668 --> 00:20:06,900
Death-row guy is dying.

446
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,501
Bradycardia. His heart rate's
dropped to 30.

447
00:20:11,567 --> 00:20:13,467
He's not gonna hold
on much longer.

448
00:20:13,534 --> 00:20:15,167
<i>You just waiting</i>
<i>to call time of death,</i>

449
00:20:15,234 --> 00:20:16,534
or are you gonna
give him atropine?

450
00:20:16,601 --> 00:20:18,000
<i>(Foreman)</i>
<i>Temporary fix.</i>
Right.

451
00:20:18,067 --> 00:20:20,501
I don't know why those diabetics
are hung up on insulin,

452
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:22,200
they're just gonna
have to take more.

453
00:20:22,267 --> 00:20:23,734
Atropine's only gonna
buy you a few hours.

454
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,234
We don't even know
what's wrong with him.

455
00:20:25,301 --> 00:20:28,034
Just get out of here.

456
00:20:38,567 --> 00:20:40,000
This is Chase.

457
00:20:40,067 --> 00:20:41,833
Did you beat any confessions
out of anybody?

458
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,467
I haven't spoken
to any inmates.

459
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:45,668
Does anybody do
their jobs anymore?

460
00:20:45,734 --> 00:20:48,334
Decided Clarence's life
isn't worth risking mine for.

461
00:20:48,401 --> 00:20:50,267
I appreciate your candor.

462
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:51,967
Did you even go to the prison

463
00:20:52,034 --> 00:20:53,634
or are you just
out playing polo?

464
00:20:53,701 --> 00:20:55,367
I'm searching
both Clarence's cells.

465
00:20:55,434 --> 00:20:57,900
I figured if he's on something,
it's stashed somewhere.

466
00:20:57,967 --> 00:20:59,367
Unless he finished it.

467
00:20:59,434 --> 00:21:00,933
[laughs]
Yeah, that'd be a shame.

468
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,734
He could've shoved it anywhere.

469
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,167
There's envelopes
staked to the ceiling,

470
00:21:04,234 --> 00:21:05,634
bottles of copier toner,

471

Diagnostics is more

Well, look,
here's the good news.

518
00:24:22,567 --> 00:24:27,167
The copier fluid you drank
contains about 90% methanol,

519

<i>which is very poisonous,</i>

520

<i>the alcohol you just drank,</i>

523
00:24:36,301 --> 00:24:38,668

00:24:38,734 --> 00:24:42,167

Why are you talking to me?

Can it be enough
that I want to cause you pain?

539
00:25:28,134 --> 00:25:30,167
The patient is okay.

540
00:25:30,634 --> 00:25:32,034
Now you're gonna
send him back.

541
00:25:32,101 --> 00:25:33,734
Absolutely.

sick and I'm keeping him here.

Now either you
can do your job

00:29:31,634 --> 00:29:33,134
Are you just trying to prove

631
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,701
that who someone
is doesn't matter?

632
00:29:34,767 --> 00:29:37,101
That all that matters
is your stupid puzzle?

633
00:29:42,367 --> 00:29:45,901
Fine, treat them the same.

634
00:29:45,967 --> 00:29:50,834
That's all I'm asking.
One test.

635
00:29:50,901 --> 00:29:55,233
Wow.
That is remarkable.

636
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,567
According to those patchouli-oil
selling new-agers,

637
00:29:58,634 --> 00:30:01,901
it's supposed to be
the terminal patient.

638
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:05,500
But you're going through
the five stages.

639
00:30:05,567 --> 00:30:07,467
You just made a completely
seamless transition

640
00:30:07,534 --> 00:30:09,967
from anger to bargaining.

641
00:30:10,034 --> 00:30:13,600
Cover two more
of my clinic hours,

642
00:30:13,667 --> 00:30:15,434
and you can have
your one procedure.

643
00:30:24,267 --> 00:30:27,168
[computer beeps]
No lesions,
no aneurisms.

644
00:30:27,233 --> 00:30:31,534
Ironically, the mind of a killer
looks completely normal.

645
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,967
If someone asked you
to describe me to them,

646
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:37,667
what's the first thing
you'd tell 'em?

647
00:30:37,734 --> 00:30:40,400
Insecure.

648
00:30:40,467 --> 00:30:42,400
What are you asking?

649
00:30:42,467 --> 00:30:46,001
Like if you were setting
me up on a blind date.

650
00:30:46,068 --> 00:30:48,333
Would you describe me
to the girl as

651
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,367
the black guy,
a neurologist,

652
00:30:50,434 --> 00:30:51,767
the car thief?

653
00:30:51,834 --> 00:30:53,634
This guy is really
getting to you, isn't he?

654
00:31:24,734 --> 00:31:27,901
There's no sign of infection.

655
00:31:27,967 --> 00:31:31,567
You're gonna have
to do the biopsy.

656
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,267
<i>(Cuddy)</i>
<i>You're death-row guy</i>
<i>is still here.</i>

657
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:39,034
Yeah, sorry,
just gotta get him stabilized.

658
00:31:39,101 --> 00:31:41,101
<i>Probably keep him on fluids</i>

659
00:31:41,168 --> 00:31:43,300
for a few more hours,
then off he goes.

660
00:31:43,367 --> 00:31:46,967
Oh, yeah? 'Cause I'm figuring
that you still think he's sick.

661
00:31:47,034 --> 00:31:51,168
Figuring requires
deductive reasoning.

662
00:31:51,267 --> 00:31:53,034
I'm figuring
that you did no figuring.

663
00:31:53,101 --> 00:31:56,200
Stacy just ratted
me out, right?

664
00:31:56,267 --> 00:31:58,200
So much for attorney-client
privilege.

665
00:31:58,267 --> 00:31:59,801
I'm the client,
you moron.

666
00:31:59,867 --> 00:32:01,634
Stacy has a duty
to this hospital.

667
00:32:01,701 --> 00:32:02,901
Right.

668
00:32:02,967 --> 00:32:04,400
I'm sending him
back to prison.

669
00:32:04,467 --> 00:32:06,034
Whoa, can't.
Court order.

670
00:32:06,101 --> 00:32:08,500
Court order says
he has to be declared healthy.

671
00:32:08,567 --> 00:32:11,434
Doesn't specify which doctor
needs to make that declaration.

672
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,834
What is it, Clarence?

673
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:17,467
My gut!

674
00:32:17,534 --> 00:32:19,001
Would you describe
it as a shooting pain,

675
00:32:19,068 --> 00:32:20,168
a throbbing pain,

676
00:32:20,233 --> 00:32:22,600
<i>or maybe an imaginary pain</i>

677
00:32:22,667 --> 00:32:24,134
because you don't want
to go back to prison?

678
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,701
Where does it hurt?

679
00:32:25,767 --> 00:32:27,400
My gut, I feel like
I'm getting stabbed!

680
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:29,300
Well, he'd know.

681
00:32:29,367 --> 00:32:32,333
Let me take a look.

682
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,834
Oh, so everybody lies
except a convicted murderer.

683
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,901
I don't think
he's faking this stuff.

684
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,500
What do you think, doctor?

685
00:33:07,267 --> 00:33:09,167
I didn't have
any choice.

686
00:33:09,234 --> 00:33:11,934
No, you had to tell Cuddy.

687
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,634
She's your boss.
I get it.

688
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,568
Hitler thought he was
doing the world a favor too.

689
00:33:17,634 --> 00:33:20,134
Yeah, pretty much
on that same level.

690
00:33:20,201 --> 00:33:21,568
Gandhi didn't march the sea

691
00:33:21,634 --> 00:33:23,034
because his buddies
asked him to.

692
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,267
Pol Pot didn't wipe out
the teachers

693
00:33:24,334 --> 00:33:26,167
because he wanted
to make friends.

694
00:33:26,234 --> 00:33:27,501
You're not making
friends right now.

695
00:33:27,568 --> 00:33:30,434
I trusted you.

696
00:33:30,501 --> 00:33:31,867
I know.

697
00:33:35,534 --> 00:33:38,434
Wilson's a fool.
I'm an idiot.

698
00:33:38,501 --> 00:33:42,201
I had to do
what I thought was right.

699
00:33:42,267 --> 00:33:44,668
It's the only reason
anybody does anything.

700
00:33:48,733 --> 00:33:50,134
Surgery went fine.

701
00:33:50,201 --> 00:33:52,568
They removed almost a foot
of necrotic bowel.

702
00:33:52,634 --> 00:33:54,434
They're shackling him
and taking him into recovery.

703
00:33:54,501 --> 00:33:58,833
I wonder...

704
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:02,934
I wonder why Clarence
killed that second inmate.

705
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,467
Fine, I'll bite.

706
00:34:04,534 --> 00:34:05,800
What the hell are
you talking about?

707
00:34:05,867 --> 00:34:07,867
Everything we do

708
00:34:07,934 --> 00:34:11,267
is dictated by motive.

709
00:34:11,334 --> 00:34:12,601
<i>(House)</i>
<i>Why did he kill</i>
<i>his girlfriend?</i>

710
00:34:12,668 --> 00:34:13,800
Because he's a maniac.

711
00:34:13,867 --> 00:34:15,867
Is that the reason he gave?

712
00:34:15,934 --> 00:34:17,900
She was cheating on him.

713
00:34:17,967 --> 00:34:20,501
Jealousy.

714
00:34:20,568 --> 00:34:22,034
That gets him sent
to prison

715
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,934
where he kills
inmate number one. Why?

716
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,167
Guy attacked him first.

717
00:34:27,234 --> 00:34:30,034
Revenge.

718
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,634
Who's he kill after that?

719
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,967
Prison guard.

720
00:34:33,034 --> 00:34:36,201
He had a file full
of abuse complaints.

721
00:34:36,267 --> 00:34:38,767
Probably been kicking
Clarence's ass for months.

722
00:34:38,833 --> 00:34:41,067
Clarence is just
ridding the world of bad seeds.

723
00:34:41,134 --> 00:34:45,100
We'll call that one
retribution.

724
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:47,534
Then he kills
inmate number two.

725
00:34:47,601 --> 00:34:50,700
Anybody know why?

726
00:34:50,767 --> 00:34:52,467
Uh-uh, it's not in there.

727
00:34:57,401 --> 00:35:01,134
<i>(Clarence)</i>
<i>All of a sudden,</i>
<i>I've gotta have a reason?</i>

728
00:35:01,201 --> 00:35:02,900
It's an anomaly.

729
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:04,967
Doctors love anomalies.

730
00:35:05,034 --> 00:35:07,267
Dark spot on an x-ray,

731
00:35:07,334 --> 00:35:09,201
bright spot on an MRI.

732
00:35:09,267 --> 00:35:12,634
Killing that second inmate

733
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,534
was the homicidal equivalent
of blood in the urine.

734
00:35:14,601 --> 00:35:17,568
It doesn't fit.

735
00:35:17,634 --> 00:35:20,234
I'm getting interested
in things that don't fit.

736
00:35:20,301 --> 00:35:21,934
Tell me why you did it.

737
00:35:25,534 --> 00:35:27,668
Your other victims

738
00:35:27,733 --> 00:35:31,234
you were almost
bragging about.

739
00:35:31,301 --> 00:35:32,501
What was different
about this guy?

740
00:35:36,034 --> 00:35:39,434
It happened when
I was in gen pop.

741
00:35:42,934 --> 00:35:47,900
I was in the library
just reading.

742
00:35:47,967 --> 00:35:50,134
And I started feeling
real nervous.

743
00:35:50,201 --> 00:35:52,634
This guy was staring at me.

744
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:56,934
I could feel his eyes digging
holes in the back of my neck.

745
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,134
It made me feel crazy.

746
00:36:00,201 --> 00:36:03,000
Sweat was pouring
down my face.

747
00:36:03,067 --> 00:36:07,334
I could hear my heartbeat
racing in my ears.

748
00:36:10,267 --> 00:36:14,134
I just raged out
on the dude.

749
00:36:19,833 --> 00:36:21,867
So what's the differential
for raging out?

750
00:36:21,934 --> 00:36:24,134
Excess testosterone.
Steroids--
Adrenaline?

751
00:36:24,201 --> 00:36:26,334
Prep Clarence for surgery.

752
00:36:26,401 --> 00:36:28,167
Care to share
with the class?

753
00:36:28,234 --> 00:36:30,134
Oh, come on, do I have
to spell it out for you?

754
00:36:30,201 --> 00:36:31,700
<i>Pheochromocytoma.</i>

755
00:36:31,767 --> 00:36:34,401
Actually, I'm not sure
how you spell it.

756
00:36:34,467 --> 00:36:36,434
But you said it
yourself, adrenaline.

757
00:36:36,501 --> 00:36:38,900
Pheochromocytoma sits on top
of the adrenal gland,

758
00:36:38,967 --> 00:36:40,668
randomly spits out
oodles of the stuff.

759
00:36:40,733 --> 00:36:42,700
It's perfect.
It explains everything.

760
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:44,601
The tachycardia,
pulmonary edema,

761
00:36:44,668 --> 00:36:46,100
the vasoconstriction
that caused the necrotic bowel.

762
00:36:46,167 --> 00:36:47,733
It even explains how
he had the strength

763
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,967
to rip the rail off his bed.

764
00:36:49,034 --> 00:36:50,568
Pheo's extremely rare.

765
00:36:50,634 --> 00:36:51,833
I love rare.

766
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,568
Set up an MRI.
Where's Cameron?

767
00:36:56,201 --> 00:36:58,367
Like I don't know.

768
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,367
[both talking]

769
00:37:03,434 --> 00:37:04,800
<i>Dr. Cameron?</i>

770
00:37:04,867 --> 00:37:06,767
Can I borrow you
for a consult?

771
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:09,067
Bittersweet thing about being
head of the oncology department,

772
00:37:09,134 --> 00:37:12,100
I get CCd on all
the biopsy results.

773
00:37:12,167 --> 00:37:13,534
Yeah, I know.

774
00:37:13,601 --> 00:37:15,833
She's terminal.

775
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,767
Yeah, so I take it
you were in there informing her?

776
00:37:19,833 --> 00:37:23,034
Well, I--I haven't exactly
gotten around to that,

777
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,334
but I was just--

778
00:37:24,401 --> 00:37:25,833
Doing what?
Making friends?

779
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,867
Cindy's divorced.

780
00:37:28,934 --> 00:37:31,067
She doesn't have any kids,

781
00:37:31,134 --> 00:37:32,668
no siblings,
both her parents are--

782
00:37:32,733 --> 00:37:34,367
It's not your job
to be her friend.

783
00:37:34,434 --> 00:37:36,668
Do you understand?

784
00:37:36,733 --> 00:37:38,967
And it's not worth it.

785
00:37:39,034 --> 00:37:40,668
She feels better her
final few days,

786
00:37:40,733 --> 00:37:42,434
and you're not the same,
maybe for years.

787
00:37:42,501 --> 00:37:43,668
You don't think
it's worth it?

788
00:37:43,733 --> 00:37:44,934
I know it's not worth it.

789
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:54,201
My husband--

790
00:37:56,967 --> 00:38:00,134
I met him just after
he was diagnosed

791
00:38:00,201 --> 00:38:02,067
with terminal brain cancer.

792
00:38:02,134 --> 00:38:04,568
If I hadn't married him,

793
00:38:04,634 --> 00:38:07,668
he was alone.

794
00:38:07,733 --> 00:38:10,401
When a good person dies,

795
00:38:10,467 --> 00:38:14,234
there should be
an impact on the world.

796
00:38:14,301 --> 00:38:16,234
Somebody should notice.

797
00:38:16,301 --> 00:38:18,668
Somebody should be upset.

798
00:38:23,733 --> 00:38:25,267
Pheo--what?

799
00:38:25,334 --> 00:38:27,000
I don't even remember.

800
00:38:27,067 --> 00:38:29,201
It's just a fancy way
of saying

801
00:38:29,267 --> 00:38:32,067
small, adrenaline-secreting
tumor.

802
00:38:32,134 --> 00:38:36,401
Yeah, that clarified
it for you.

803
00:38:36,467 --> 00:38:39,100
All you need to know is,
if I'm right, we can fix it.

804
00:38:39,167 --> 00:38:41,067
<i>Just gotta find it first.</i>

805
00:38:41,134 --> 00:38:43,267
We need an MRI.

806
00:38:43,334 --> 00:38:45,733
It's completely painless
for most people.

807
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,967
But not for me?

808
00:38:47,034 --> 00:38:49,067
I assume you got

809
00:38:49,134 --> 00:38:51,301
<i>those tattoos in prison.</i>

810
00:38:51,367 --> 00:38:54,934
<i>Prison tats often contain</i>
<i>inks with heavy metals.</i>

811
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,534
<i>The MRI is basically</i>
<i>a giant magnet.</i>

812
00:38:57,601 --> 00:39:00,201
It'll suck those metallic inks
right out of your skin.

813
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:11,034
[machine beeps]

814

815

[screaming continues]

816
00:39:23,634 --> 00:39:26,367
Stop squirming.

817

<i>Don't make us</i>
<i>do this again.</i>

818
00:39:29,668 --> 00:39:32,334
Big baby.

819
00:39:32,401 --> 00:39:34,201
I still don't see anything.

820
00:39:36,867 --> 00:39:38,934
<i>Turn it off!</i>
[screams]

821
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
There's Waldo.

822
00:39:41,534 --> 00:39:42,833
Found it, Clarence.

823
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,833
<i>(Clarence)</i>
<i>Turn it off!</i>

824
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,900
Turn this damn thing off!

825
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,800
Keep him in there
until you guys see it too.

826
00:39:50,234 --> 00:39:53,000
Son of a bitch.

827
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,767
Looks like they got
the pheo out successfully.

828
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:07,867
So what now?

829
00:40:07,934 --> 00:40:09,833
Clarence goes back
to death row.

830
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,800
Just like that?

831
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:14,134
He's cured.

832
00:40:14,201 --> 00:40:17,201
That tumor caused
random shots of adrenaline,

833
00:40:17,267 --> 00:40:20,134
which obviously led to the rage
attacks that made him

834
00:40:20,201 --> 00:40:22,434
<i>become a murderer</i>
<i>in the first place.</i>

835
00:40:22,501 --> 00:40:25,733
My, God, you're right.
Let's call the surgeons.

836
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,700
We gotta save that tumor,
put it on the witness stand.

837
00:40:27,767 --> 00:40:29,401
We could testify
in Clarence's appeal.

838
00:40:29,467 --> 00:40:32,334
[sniffs]
You smell that?

839
00:40:32,401 --> 00:40:34,334
I think that is
the stink of hypocrisy.

840
00:40:34,401 --> 00:40:36,601
<i>You wouldn't even</i>
<i>consider the notion</i>

841
00:40:36,668 --> 00:40:39,833
that Clarence's social
upbringing was responsible

842
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,700
<i>for what he became,</i>
<i>but now you're</i>

843
00:40:41,767 --> 00:40:42,601
sprinting to the witness stand
to blame everything

844
00:40:42,668 --> 00:40:43,833
on a little tumor.

845
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,067
A person's upbringing
and their biology

846
00:40:45,134 --> 00:40:46,767
are completely different.

847
00:40:46,833 --> 00:40:52,167
Yeah, because you only
overcame one of them.

848
00:40:52,234 --> 00:40:55,967
Let's just give Clarence
a free pass, huh?

849
00:40:56,034 --> 00:40:58,733
We'll probably gonna piss off
all those other pheo sufferers

850
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,534
<i>who manage to control</i>
<i>their "rage attacks"</i>

851
00:41:00,601 --> 00:41:02,401
and become lawyers,
or race car drivers

852
00:41:02,467 --> 00:41:04,201
or even doctors.

853
00:41:04,267 --> 00:41:06,234
<i>Removing that tumor</i>
<i>puts a stop</i>

854
00:41:06,301 --> 00:41:08,700
to those random
shots of adrenaline.

855
00:41:08,767 --> 00:41:10,668
It doesn't absolve him.

856
00:41:10,733 --> 00:41:12,700
You want him to be executed?

857
00:41:12,767 --> 00:41:15,733
That's not what I'm saying.

858
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,201
Got an opinion?

859
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:22,401
Everyone's got an opinion.

860
00:41:26,833 --> 00:41:28,534
I, um...

861
00:41:28,601 --> 00:41:32,100
I think I'm gonna testify
at Clarence's appeal.

862
00:41:32,167 --> 00:41:35,301
You'll do what
you think is right.

863
00:41:36,833 --> 00:41:39,467
On your own time.
