00:00:02,212 --> 00:00:03,674
前情回顾
<i>[Narrator] Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

3
00:00:03,674 --> 00:00:04,497
病人的名字?
- [Bailey] Patient's name! - How many times...

4
00:00:04,498 --> 00:00:06,378
-我告诉你多少次了不要来烦我当我在... - ellis grey.
- [Yang] Ellis Grey. - Meredith's mother.

5
00:00:06,478 --> 00:00:09,636
-Meredith的妈妈. -问题不在于是那个Burke和我分手了,
It's not that Burke broke up with me, it's how he broke up with me.

6
00:00:09,717 --> 00:00:11,237
而在于他是如何向我提出分手的.
Have you even told Burke about the baby?

7
00:00:11,337 --> 00:00:13,861
劳烦你和 burke说一下孩子的事好不好?

8
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:14,546
Cristina!

9
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:16,580
-Cristina! -是宫外孕.
[Addison] It's an extrauterine pregnancy.

10
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,090
-她大量出血. -不要装做是我男友的样子和我说话.
Stop talking to me like you're my boyfriend! Stop talking to me at all.

11
00:00:20,101 --> 00:00:21,816
再也不要和我说话.
If you came here to try to win me back, forget about it.

12
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:23,717
如果你出现在这里是为了重新得到我,

13
00:00:23,817 --> 00:00:26,288
-你不用想了. -我只知道我还爱着你.
I just know I still love you.

14
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:29,850
恨你是最令人精疲力尽的事.
Hating you is the most exhausting.

15
00:00:38,402 --> 00:00:41,028
能在外科实习期生存的关键
<i>[Meredith] The key to surviving</i> <i>a surgical internship is denial.</i>

16
00:00:41,639 --> 00:00:42,628
是否认.
<i>We deny that we're tired,</i> <i>we deny that we're scared,</i>

17
00:00:43,571 --> 00:00:44,886
我们否认疲劳.

18
00:00:45,292 --> 00:00:46,492
我们否认恐惧.
<i>we deny how badly</i> <i>we want to succeed,</i>

19
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,559
我们否认我们有多么想成功.

20
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:53,316
最重要的是, 我们否认我们在否认.
<i>and most importantly,</i> <i>we deny that we're in denial.</i>

21
00:00:53,427 --> 00:00:55,249
我不知道.当我离开的时候, cristina 说她很好.
When I left, Cristina said she was OK.

22
00:00:55,349 --> 00:00:58,146
没有人经历过她所经历的事， 并且现在能完全放下.
Nobody goes through what she did and is totally over it by now.

23
00:00:58,246 --> 00:00:58,951
Cristina可以.
- Cristina can. - She's fine.

24
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,159
-她很棒. -过于棒了.她这是冷酷.
Too fine. She's cold.

25
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,334
并不是这样，她是个中坚分子 她只是在纹理中放了些冰块而已
No, she's hardcore. She's got ice in her veins.

26
00:01:04,534 --> 00:01:06,367
她做了所有她该做的.
- She does what she has to do to. - She lost a baby.

27
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:08,759
她失去了孩子. 她失去了输卵管.
And a fallopian tube. She acts like she doesn't care.

28
00:01:08,859 --> 00:01:10,043
但她表现得一点都不关心.
She's all "Hello, I'm totally fine."

29
00:01:10,143 --> 00:01:11,619
她完全就是个只说"你好, 我很好"的人.
She's my friend too but she's acting like she has no emotions or warmth,

30
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:14,524
虽然她也是我的朋友, 但是她表现得就像是

31
00:01:14,624 --> 00:01:18,294
她没有感情和热情, 像是没有灵魂一样.
like she's missing a soul.

32
00:01:18,685 --> 00:01:20,523
上帝啊,她会成为一位伟大的外科医生的.
- God, she's gonna make a great surgeon. - George!

33
00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:21,892
-George. -这是真的.
It's true. You show no weakness, you make it to the top.

34
00:01:22,275 --> 00:01:24,569
如果你不示弱, 你就能成为最强的.

35
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:26,721
有些人仅仅是把他们的感情留给自己.
Some people just keep their feelings to themselves.

36
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:29,089
我们仅仅看到我们想看到的
<i>[Meredith]</i> <i>We only see what we want to see</i>

37
00:01:29,704 --> 00:01:31,361
相信我们想信的.
<i>and believe what we want to believe.</i>

38
00:01:32,226 --> 00:01:33,493
确实是这样的.
<i>And it works.</i>

39
00:01:33,796 --> 00:01:35,788
我们老是在骗自己,
<i>We lie to ourselves so much that,</i> <i>after a while,</i>

40
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:38,595
而过了一会儿,这些谎言开始看上去像真理的一样了.
<i>the lies start to seem like the truth.</i>

41
00:01:39,553 --> 00:01:40,534
Meredith吻了我.
Meredith kissed me. Addison kissed me.

42
00:01:40,661 --> 00:01:41,893
Addison吻了我.
My wife and my girlfriend kissed me on the same day.

43
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:43,823
我的妻子和女朋友都吻了我

44
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:47,736
-在同一天. -Joe...我看上去对你友好吗?
Joe, do I look friendly to you?

45
00:01:47,794 --> 00:01:51,076
你是个充满欢乐和博爱的小女人.
Oh. Yeah, you're a tiny little kitten of joy and love.

46
00:01:52,521 --> 00:01:54,105
-怎么啦? -他救了我的命.
- What? He saved my life. - His first mistake.

47
00:01:54,363 --> 00:01:55,353
这是第一个错误
McDreamy, go sit by someone who cares.

48
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:57,561
美梦先生, 找关心你的人谈心去.
<i>[Meredith] We deny so much</i> <i>that we can't recognize the truth,</i>

49
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,208
我们否认得太多了

50
00:01:59,308 --> 00:02:01,134
以至于不能辨认

51
00:02:02,087 --> 00:02:03,956
就在我们眼前的真相.
<i>right in front of our faces.</i>

52
00:02:04,056 --> 00:02:05,151
一些都会好起来的.
Everything's gonna be fine. Addison'll go back to New York.

53
00:02:05,755 --> 00:02:07,885
Addison会回到纽约去,

54
00:02:07,985 --> 00:02:09,192
meredith和我会重新开始.
Meredith and I will start over, everything's gonna be fine. Right?

55
00:02:09,292 --> 00:02:10,939
一些都会好起来的,对吗?

56
00:02:12,521 --> 00:02:14,290
你可真是蠢的无可救药了.
You so damn stupid.

57
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:20,465
我要你们今天每个人都全神贯注.
[Bailey] I want everyone focused.

58
00:02:20,565 --> 00:02:22,384
cristina不在,我们少了一个人,
With Cristina out, we're short an intern and I feel it will be one of those days.

59
00:02:22,484 --> 00:02:24,384
而且我有预感以后几天也会是这样.
- And, Karev, see the chief today. - What for?

60
00:02:24,484 --> 00:02:26,112
karev, 下班之前去看看头儿.

61
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:26,984
为什么?
Do I look psychic to you? He's the chief. He asked. You go.

62
00:02:27,246 --> 00:02:28,082
你以为我是你精神领袖吗?

63
00:02:28,362 --> 00:02:29,994
他是你的上司，他让你去你就去.
- What did he do now? - Maybe he gave the chief syphilis.

64
00:02:30,094 --> 00:02:31,091
他这次又怎么了?

65
00:02:31,745 --> 00:02:33,424
可能把梅毒传染给了头儿吧.

66
00:02:34,027 --> 00:02:36,252
当我们在柏力滋丛林中的时候,
So we're in the middle of the Belizian jungle and this jaguarondi

67
00:02:36,352 --> 00:02:39,185
一只美洲豹突然跳了出来
jumps out and bites one of the guides.

68
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:40,542
咬住其中一个导游.
They all look at me. They're yelling, "You're a doctor, help him!"

69
00:02:41,164 --> 00:02:42,170
所有人都看着我

70
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,261
他们大声喊,"你是博士，救救他"

71
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:47,099
我突然发现“博士”在这一刻没一点好处.
This is one time a Ph.D. Does no good.

72
00:02:47,161 --> 00:02:49,717
打扰一下，我是不是错过了什么社科课的铃声?
I'm sorry, did I miss the bell for social hour?

73
00:02:49,817 --> 00:02:51,706
-不过是个传教士生涯的小故事. -你是传教士?
- Missionary tales. - You're a missionary?

74
00:02:51,806 --> 00:02:54,595
我不是，我父母是. 我们旅行很多地方，他们现在还在旅行.
No, my parents. We traveled a lot. They still do.

75
00:02:54,695 --> 00:02:56,287
Oh, wow.这个挺棒的.
Wow. This stuff is great.

76
00:02:57,731 --> 00:02:59,797
Um, 这位是Burke医生的病人...
Um, this is Dr. Burke's patient, Kalpana Vera...

77
00:02:59,897 --> 00:03:01,286
-kalpana vera. -Kalpana.
"Kull-punnah." Named by villagers in Nepal.

78
00:03:02,193 --> 00:03:03,975
名字是尼泊尔一个地方的村名帮我取的.
Presents with multiple syncopal episodes and ventricular arrhythmias.

79
00:03:04,597 --> 00:03:06,871
Uh, 她的症状是多重间歇性昏厥

80
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:08,028
并伴有心律不齐.
- So you've been passing out? - And having palpitations.

81
00:03:08,128 --> 00:03:09,218
这么说你曾昏倒过?

82
00:03:09,318 --> 00:03:10,939
没错，有时候还有心悸.
History of rheumatic heart disease with mitral valve stenosis.

83
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,312
以前曾患有风湿性心脏病 以及二尖瓣狭窄

84
00:03:14,412 --> 00:03:16,834
他们需要把我装上船，从赞比亚运回来
They had to ship me from Zambia to the States

85
00:03:17,001 --> 00:03:18,730
那时候我只有8岁，整整治了3个月.
for three months of treatment when I was eight. Rheumatic fever almost killed me.

86
00:03:19,311 --> 00:03:21,108
风湿热差点就要了我的命.
Dr. Stevens. What are the primary causes of ventricular arrhythmias?

87
00:03:21,245 --> 00:03:25,377
Stevens医生, 导致心律不齐的 最主要原因是什么?

88
00:03:25,987 --> 00:03:28,992
心血管疾病,二尖瓣下垂, 外界刺激, 吸毒
Valvular disease, mitral valve prolapse,

89
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:30,069
stimulants, drugs, and metabolic abnormalities.

90
00:03:29,092 --> 00:03:30,784
以及新陈代谢紊乱.

91
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:33,871
<i>[PA] Scrub nurse to OR Six.</i>

92
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,484
怎么了?
- What? - Out.

93
00:03:35,584 --> 00:03:36,356
出去.
- I'm fine. - Out!

94
00:03:37,034 --> 00:03:38,247
-我没事. -出去.
You better be in your room by the time we round on you.

95
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:41,191
你最好呆在你的病房里 当我们巡视到你那里的时候.

96
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,316
什么时候呢?
- And when will that be? - In fifteen seconds.

97
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:43,833
15秒之后.

98
00:03:45,081 --> 00:03:49,743
-14... 13...12... 11... -内裤真可爱, yang.
Fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven...

99
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,823
- Nice panties, Yang. - [Giggling]

100
00:03:53,635 --> 00:03:55,480
做你的梦去...坏蛋.
In your dreams, Evil Spawn.

101
00:03:56,972 --> 00:03:57,865
cristina yang.
Cristina Yang. Post-op day three from a unilateral salpingectomy.

102
00:03:57,965 --> 00:04:01,146
入院三天,刚做完 单输卵管切除...

103
00:04:01,246 --> 00:04:02,187
并且已经做好重返工作岗位的准备.
- And ready to get back to work. - Is she?

104
00:04:02,593 --> 00:04:03,127
她行吗?
I'm taking solids and my pain is controlled with oral meds. I'm ready.

105
00:04:03,227 --> 00:04:04,977
我已经可以吃固体食物了

106
00:04:05,077 --> 00:04:07,439
同时口服止痛药对我 就很有效用了，我准备好了.
Didn't the nurse say this morning you had a fever?

107
00:04:07,618 --> 00:04:10,085
今早的那个护士 不是说你发烧了吗？

108
00:04:10,185 --> 00:04:10,978
妈.
- Mother. - Cristina, did you have a fever?

109
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:12,247
Cristina,你发过烧吗?

110
00:04:16,174 --> 00:04:18,182
体温最高到101度(华氏),有什么了不起啊?
Temp spiked to 101 last night. Big deal.

111
00:04:18,382 --> 00:04:21,066
上个月她工作的两个 夜班中曾发烧到102度
She worked two shifts with a 102 degree flu.

112
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,758
是啊,太对了 george.非常感谢.
Yes. Exactly, George. Thank you.

113
00:04:22,858 --> 00:04:24,208
我们感激你的奉献,
And we appreciate your dedication, but you stay in bed until it normalizes.

114
00:04:24,308 --> 00:04:26,474
但是你现在要躺在床上,直到一切稳定下来.

115
00:04:26,574 --> 00:04:28,910
我不知告诉她多少次了
I keep telling her there's more to life than surgery and career.

116
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,671
好多东西比医生和事业更重要.
Go upholster something.

117
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,319
妈,去搞搞装修吧.
Look, I need you to relax, shut up, and get better.

118
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:35,435
-听着,你现在给我放松下来, -把嘴闭上,快点好起来.

119
00:04:35,783 --> 00:04:37,865
这周你是病人 那下周你就可以做医生了
You're a patient this week so you can be a doctor next week.

120
00:04:37,871 --> 00:04:38,504
明白?
Mer. You cannot leave me alone with her.

121
00:04:39,207 --> 00:04:39,758
Mere.

122
00:04:40,778 --> 00:04:42,034
你不能让我单独和她呆在一起.
I am flying over the cuckoo's nest here. Save me.

123
00:04:42,134 --> 00:04:44,065
她快把我逼疯了 注解:"One flew over the cuckoo's nest"是一部电影 讲一个精神病院的故事

124
00:04:44,165 --> 00:04:46,130
-你必须救我. -你需要时间疗养.
- You need time to heal. - I'm healed. I'm healed!

125
00:04:46,165 --> 00:04:48,370
我已经好了,全好了!

126
00:04:53,714 --> 00:04:54,464
Oh, 天.
Oh, God.

127
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:57,782
好 O'malley医生,你来报告.
OK, Dr. O'Malley, you're presenting.

128
00:04:58,392 --> 00:05:00,801
Okay, Grey医生,手术后第三天..
OK, Dr. Grey is post-op day three from a tumor resection.

129
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:02,282
是肿瘤切除
Wrong, wrong, wrong. He's got it all wrong.

130
00:05:02,382 --> 00:05:03,570
不对,不对,不对.

131
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,336
他全搞错了 根本就不是哮喘, 是gerd(胃食管倒流症).
It's not asthma, it's GERD. He needs a Nissen fundoplication.

132
00:05:06,422 --> 00:05:08,084
他需要做尼森治愈术
- I don't want her in the room. - Mom!

133
00:05:08,422 --> 00:05:10,261
-我不想在这里看见她. -妈.

134

00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:24,939
"Gunshot wound to the head."

275
00:11:26,862 --> 00:11:28,440
头部枪伤是怎么他妈的回事?
Where the hell's this GSW to the head? Why wasn't the trauma team called?

276
00:11:28,715 --> 00:11:30,269
为什么外伤科的人没来?
Hello? Are you people insane?

277
00:11:30,874 --> 00:11:33,119
有人吗?你们都傻了啊?

278
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,194
你那枪伤受害者在那儿呢.
There's your gunshot victim.

279
00:11:36,855 --> 00:11:37,645
他?
Him?

280
00:11:43,018 --> 00:11:46,946
我正在重新把客厅铺上米色的丝绸,
I'm redoing the living room in beige silks, I'm thinking.

281
00:11:47,481 --> 00:11:48,359
我在想.
And modern. Very mid-century.

282
00:11:49,485 --> 00:11:52,433
时尚而具有中世纪的味道.

283
00:11:52,657 --> 00:11:55,542
-还有餐厅... -妈,把我脚趾拿回来.
- And the dining room... - Mother, give me back my toes.

284
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:59,392
Okay. 我换个话题.
OK. I change the subject.

285
00:12:01,026 --> 00:12:02,024
谁是爸爸?
- Who's the father? - Mid-century, did you say?

286
00:12:02,517 --> 00:12:03,401
你是说你喜欢中世纪吗?
Someone you work with, right? Was it just for sex?

287
00:12:03,501 --> 00:12:05,578
和你一起工作的人,对吧?

288
00:12:05,712 --> 00:12:07,937
或者仅仅是打个炮而已?

289
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:10,344
你的想法真是不切实际
You make such a point of not forming attachments.

290
00:12:11,128 --> 00:12:14,373
20分钟.留给我 20分钟的清净吧.
20 minutes. All I want is 20 minutes of peace and quiet.

291
00:12:15,324 --> 00:12:19,290
我养的女儿应该感激 她妈妈的帮忙.
The daughter I raised would appreciate her mother's help.

292
00:12:19,407 --> 00:12:24,006
你养的女儿正在恳求你 离开这里,马上!
The daughter you raised is begging for you to go. Now.

293
00:12:24,294 --> 00:12:26,871
我根本没有义务来这里 你知道,我很忙
I didn't have to come here. You know I'm very busy.

294
00:12:26,971 --> 00:12:28,926
我知道,真的,全知道, 你正在重新装修你的房子
Yeah, I know. Redecorating your house.

295
00:12:34,807 --> 00:12:36,904
请你给我一杯摩卡咖啡可以吗?
Well, can you get me a mocha latte, please?

296
00:12:37,094 --> 00:12:38,133
脱脂的.
A non-fat one.

297
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:40,818
不, 普通的.
No. A fat one!

298
00:12:48,211 --> 00:12:48,962
嗯,你能走.
You're walking, you're talking, there's no exit wound.

299
00:12:50,517 --> 00:12:52,450
你能说话,并没有太大的损伤.

300
00:12:53,902 --> 00:12:55,381
这个标记看上去更像一个烧伤.
- This mark here looks more like a burn. - I'm telling you, I shot myself.

301
00:12:55,773 --> 00:12:57,073
我告诉你了,我射到了我自己...
Pulled the trigger cleaning my.22. I thought the clip was out.

302
00:12:58,091 --> 00:12:59,701
我在擦拭我的22的时候,扣动了扳机.

303
00:12:59,801 --> 00:13:00,674
我以为弹膛已经拿出去了.
If you're thinking suicide, don't.

304
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,555
如果你正认为我是自杀的话,千万别,
People make mistakes. I made a mistake.

305
00:13:03,137 --> 00:13:04,814
人人都会犯错,我也会...

306
00:13:06,904 --> 00:13:08,357
我正为此付出代价.
And now I'm paying for it. But I did shoot myself.

307
00:13:09,554 --> 00:13:10,705
但是我的确对自己开枪了.

308
00:13:18,273 --> 00:13:19,257
你的监护医生呢?
- Where's your IV? - I'm taking solids. I Hep-Locked it.

309
00:13:19,357 --> 00:13:20,863
我正在吃固体食物,正在消化着.
- On whose orders? - Mine.

310
00:13:20,963 --> 00:13:22,754
-谁下的指令? -我自己.

311
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:27,094
OK. Yang.

312
00:13:24,665 --> 00:13:26,728
Okay. "yang."

313
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,927
这个命令如何?"上床休息,
How about this order: "Bed rest, out of bed to chair, bathroom privileges."

314
00:13:30,027 --> 00:13:32,192
"床和椅子之外,只可以去洗手间"

315
00:13:32,754 --> 00:13:34,983
和你在护士站偷病历无关
Nothing about stealing charts.

316
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,588
Okay, 知道吗? Hey, hey, hey! 把这个给我.
OK, you know what. Hey. Give me that.

317
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,125
Ah. Ah. 这样满意了吗?
There. Satisfied? I'm "out of bed to chair."

318
00:13:43,225 --> 00:13:44,763
我不在床上,在椅子上.
- I'm telling your intern on you. - Meredith?

319
00:13:44,863 --> 00:13:47,236
-我会告诉你的监护实习医生的. -Meredith?

320
00:13:47,804 --> 00:13:49,859
-Yeah. -哦,我好怕怕哦
- Yep. - Oh, I'm so scared.

321
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,193
Grey医生, 你好吗'?
- Dr. Grey, how are you doing? - You're here. Good.

322
00:13:59,274 --> 00:14:00,091
你来了. 好.
I need the results of the barium esophagram or the EGD.

323
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,472
我需要你钡理化验的结果

324
00:14:02,572 --> 00:14:05,315
或者e.g.d.,但是你什么都没给我,Okay.
And you have neither. OK, no worries. I'll be here when you get back.

325
00:14:05,702 --> 00:14:07,641
不用担心,你回来的时候我会在这里的.

326
00:14:09,379 --> 00:14:10,789
今天你是她的实习生?
So today you're her intern. Well, that's better than being her husband.

327
00:14:11,562 --> 00:14:13,148
嘿嘿,比做她老公好多了.
- That's a matter of opinion. - Good morning, Ellis.

328
00:14:13,514 --> 00:14:14,599
这只不过是看法不同的问题罢了.

329
00:14:15,391 --> 00:14:16,340
早上好, ellis.
Richard, good to see you. I need those labs immediately.

330
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,187
Richard, 见到你真好. 我现在就需要那些结果.

331
00:14:20,536 --> 00:14:21,830
头儿, um...
Chief? She's not a surgical patient anymore.

332
00:14:22,979 --> 00:14:24,511
她不再是个等待接受手术的病人了,
And I'd really like to get back to the OR.

333
00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:26,357
所以我更愿意回到手术室去
So, do you think I could hand her off to someone else?

334
00:14:26,457 --> 00:14:29,076
嗯,你觉得我能把她 交给其他人吗?

335
00:14:29,611 --> 00:14:33,035
O'malley, alzheimer导致她 颠倒黑白
O'Malley, Alzheimer's causes her reality to shift depending on situation or mood.

336
00:14:33,135 --> 00:14:35,164
全凭当时的情况,以及她的心情.
She needs stability right now.

337
00:14:35,531 --> 00:14:37,030
她此刻需要的是稳定下来.
That's why I'm depending on you to keep a special eye on her.

338
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:40,053
这就是为什么我相信你 让你对她特殊照顾

339
00:14:40,538 --> 00:14:43,965
是的,我知道,但是先生,那个..,
Yes, I know, sir.

340
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,615
But, you know, it just doesn't seem fair to me.

341
00:14:44,065 --> 00:14:45,315
这样看起来对我不是很公平.
I need those studies yesterday.

342
00:14:45,726 --> 00:14:47,213
我需要昨天的那些病例.

343
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,168
你听到医生说什么了.
You heard the doctor.

344
00:14:51,398 --> 00:14:52,514
去吧.
Get moving.

345
00:14:58,391 --> 00:14:59,149
我看到了.
I saw that. I saw you take that pill.

346
00:14:59,778 --> 00:15:01,025
我看到你吃药了.

347
00:15:02,105 --> 00:15:05,605
oh.那个是..我的药丸. 那个.."药丸"
Oh, it's my pill. You know, the pill.

348
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:08,783
这个并不在你的病历上,
It's not in your chart. You're supposed to tell us all the meds you're on.

349
00:15:08,883 --> 00:15:10,791
而且你应该告诉我们 你正在服用的所有药物.
You're not my doctor. You shouldn't even be here.

350
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:11,884
你不是我的医生.

351
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:13,924
-你甚至不应该在这里. -她说的对.
- She's right. You shouldn't be here. - She took unauthorized medication.

352
00:15:14,652 --> 00:15:15,294
你不应该在这里.

353
00:15:15,607 --> 00:15:17,474
我看到她在吃不知名的药品.
I'm on the pill and I had grapefruit juice this morning.

354
00:15:17,574 --> 00:15:18,391
我一直在吃这药丸,

355
00:15:18,491 --> 00:15:20,487
我今早喝了柚子汁
Since the juice inhibits enzymes involved in the metabolism of OCPs,

356
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,053
因为果汁抑止?的分泌,

357
00:15:22,153 --> 00:15:24,153
所以会影响ocps(口服避孕药)的新陈代谢
I avoided the interaction by taking it two hours after food.

358
00:15:24,205 --> 00:15:25,160
我想避免交叉作用

359
00:15:25,185 --> 00:15:26,833
所以我在饭后两个小时之后吃.
She has a doctorate in neuropharmacology.

360
00:15:27,292 --> 00:15:29,372
她是神经药理学医生, cristina.
- I don't see oral contraceptives. - Guys.

361
00:15:29,472 --> 00:15:31,133
-Well, izzie, 我没看到什么口服避... -你们.
Now you will. Go back to bed and stop poaching my patients?

362
00:15:31,233 --> 00:15:32,907
-Okay, 好了你现在应该. -你可以回到你床上去吗...

363
00:15:33,007 --> 00:15:35,292
-你可以回到你床上去吗 -别在打我病人的主意了?

364
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,067
This is ridiculous! Go back to bed and stop poaching my patients!

365
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,836
才没有...
<i>[Rapid beeping]</i>

366
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:44,233
-她心脏停止了. -呼叫警报代码.
- She's in V-fib! - Call the code!

367
00:15:46,181 --> 00:15:47,487
code blue,second floor.
- <i>[PA] Code blue, second floor.</i> - [Loud gasp]

368
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,247
Code blue.second choice
- <i>Code blue, second floor.</i> - [Coughs, inhales deeply]

369
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:54,915
- [Man] You got the code equipment? - It's all ready to go.

370
00:15:55,563 --> 00:15:56,782
-不危险了? -没有了.
- No code? - Not anymore.

371
00:15:57,335 --> 00:15:58,445
能帮我把她带回床上吗?
- Can you help us get her back in bed? - I'll help.

372
00:15:58,827 --> 00:16:00,178
我可以帮忙,就等我一下.
[Lzzie] Would you just go back to bed? Go!

373
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,354
求你能不能上床? 我说真的,快回去

374
00:16:02,891 --> 00:16:05,483
Oh,天, izzie, 如果她正在吃口服避孕药
Oh, God. You know, lzzie, if she's on OCPs, can we mark it down, OK?

375
00:16:06,104 --> 00:16:07,519
那么我们记下来,好吗?
Yeah.

376
00:16:08,111 --> 00:16:08,874
Yeah.

377
00:16:14,636 --> 00:16:17,047
jeremiah在上腹部的中间有阴影,
[Meredith] Jeremiah's got a mass in his midepigastrium.

378
00:16:17,531 --> 00:16:19,845
胰腺部位的扩散.
Diffused enlargement of the pancreas.

379
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:22,151
同时他患有低血糖...
That, with his hypoglycemic seizures...

380
00:16:22,251 --> 00:16:24,049
他需要一个极度危险的 剖腹手术...
He's gonna need an exploratory laparotomy.

381
00:16:24,633 --> 00:16:27,253
即使不考虑他的三项全能技术,
But, despite his triathlons, his lungs still make me hesitant to cut.

382
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,670
我还是犹豫是否要切除他的肺

383
00:16:30,513 --> 00:16:31,784
我们该怎么办?
What are we going to do?

384
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:34,155
我现在还不知道
- I don't know that yet. - Doctors.

385
00:16:34,809 --> 00:16:35,616
医生.
- Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd. - How old is he?

386
00:16:36,114 --> 00:16:37,281
Montgomery-shepherd医生.

387
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:40,091
-他多大? -26岁.
- He's 26. - A survivor, huh?

388
00:16:40,712 --> 00:16:42,581
-幸存者, huh? -一些吧.
And then some. My patient for at least five years.

389
00:16:42,991 --> 00:16:44,915
做我的病人至少做了5年了.
- I'm not gonna lose him now. - You planning a laparotomy?

390
00:16:45,015 --> 00:16:46,168
我现在不想失去他

391
00:16:46,566 --> 00:16:47,798
你在计划剖腹手术?
Yeah, but his lungs.

392
00:16:48,145 --> 00:16:50,476
-是啊,可是他的肺... -嗯,你知道
You know, I think I could help you with this.

393
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,289
这个我可以帮帮你.
I've seen one case like this in a nine-year-old.

394
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:54,519
我以前遇到过一个 类似的病例,是个9岁的孩子.

395
00:16:54,619 --> 00:16:56,861
最后我们做了 整个胰脏的切除.
We had to do a total pancreatectomy.

396
00:16:56,961 --> 00:16:59,341
对于你将给予我的任何 帮助我都非常感激.
I'd be honored to take any help you can give me.

397
00:16:59,922 --> 00:17:04,786
你是婴儿专家. 那个... 我... 这好像不是你的专长
You're a neonatal specialist. What...

398
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:04,615
This isn't your area.

399
00:17:06,514 --> 00:17:07,726
我的意思是说,我...
I'm just saying. I...

400
00:17:07,866 --> 00:17:10,465
我在囊肿性纤维化方面 做了两年的遗传学研究
I did genetics research in cystic fibrosis.

401
00:17:10,565 --> 00:17:12,054
我对这个还是挺了解的, Grey医生.
- I've pretty much seen it all. - Oh.

402
00:17:12,328 --> 00:17:12,880
Oh.
<i>[PA]</i> <i>Dr. Ramirez, please call extension 543.</i>

403
00:17:17,321 --> 00:17:18,324
仅仅因为她提供她一个帮助,
Just because she offered her services doesn't mean she intends to stay.

404
00:17:18,424 --> 00:17:19,848
并不代表她就想留下来了.
- Well, what does it mean? - It means that she's a good doctor.

405
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,118
那你说这算什么? 因为对我来说...

406
00:17:22,218 --> 00:17:23,242
这只是意味着她是个好医生.
[Laughs]

407
00:17:23,705 --> 00:17:26,228
Oh ho ho.为什么你突然保护起她来了?
- Why are you suddenly defending her? - I'm not.

408
00:17:26,328 --> 00:17:28,915
我没有. Meredith, 她把离婚协议给我了
Meredith, she gave me divorce papers. She filed.

409
00:17:29,272 --> 00:17:30,132
而且她已经同意了.
Oh. Well, that's good.

410
00:17:30,972 --> 00:17:33,769
Oh. 那不错.

411
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:37,076
我所应该做的就是签字,然后我就自由了.
All I have to do is sign, and I'm free.

412
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,036
我们都自由了.
We're free.

413
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:41,739
还有什么需要考虑的吗?
Is there anything to think about?

414
00:17:42,941 --> 00:17:45,229
不,当然没有 我只需要研究一下条款,
No, of course not.

415
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:47,087
I read through them, sign, then Addison's on the next plane out of here.

416
00:17:45,329 --> 00:17:47,041
签字,然后addison会搭 下一班飞机离开这里.

417
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,842
你说他在头上有枪伤?
- You say he got shot in the head? - He says he got shot in the head.

418
00:17:51,186 --> 00:17:54,217
他说他射到了自己的头. 我觉得他精神有点问题.
I say he's a mental defect.

419
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:55,659
Um, hi.
- Hi. - Ma'am, you can't be in here.

420
00:17:56,112 --> 00:17:57,536
-女士,你不能进来这里. -Yeah, 我知道.
I'm looking for Samuel Linden, he...

421
00:17:57,636 --> 00:17:59,577
我在找 samuel linden. 他...

422
00:18:02,565 --> 00:18:05,552
oh, 天啊. Samuel.那个, 怎么... 怎么...
Oh, my God. Samuel. Well, how bad is it?

423
00:18:06,096 --> 00:18:07,042
-多... 到底有多糟糕? -你是他老婆吗?
- Are you his wife? - For 21 years. Just tell me how he is.

424
00:18:07,598 --> 00:18:09,562
是了21年了都,你就告诉我他到底怎么了.

425
00:18:10,121 --> 00:18:12,130
挺好的,作为一个说他自己射了自己的人.
Fine, for a man who says he shot himself.

426
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,792
他开枪射了自己,在擦拭枪的时候.
He shot himself. He was cleaning his gun. What is wrong with you people?

427
00:18:17,615 --> 00:18:19,157
你们认为这有什么不对?
We'll know when we finish his CT.

428
00:18:19,238 --> 00:18:20,871
昨晚CT之后我们才会知道怎么回事
- This is a restricted area, ma'am. - My husband has a bullet in his head!

429
00:18:20,971 --> 00:18:24,807
-这里是员工区,女士请你离开. -不,不,我老公有颗子弹留在脑袋里了

430
00:18:24,907 --> 00:18:26,905
如果你能呆在外面的话,我们将找到结果
Then we'll find it. Wait outside,

431
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:29,578
我发誓我一拿到结果 就会让你知道
I'll be with you as soon as we know something, I promise.

432
00:18:35,463 --> 00:18:36,660
这城市里这么多好医生
Of all the fine doctors in the city, you accept a consult from Addison Shepherd?

433
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,786
-你竟然和addison shepherd会诊? -Montgomery-shepherd, 是吗?

434
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:41,684
- Montgomery-Shepherd, isn't it? - She should be on her way home.

435
00:18:39,884 --> 00:18:41,921
重点是她应该已经在回去的路上了.

436
00:18:43,561 --> 00:18:44,935
你在试着把我逼疯,是吗?
You're trying to drive me crazy, aren't you?

437
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:48,716
- <i>[bell]</i> - Hey, don't...

438
00:18:48,917 --> 00:18:51,214
-Oh, hey, 现在别做这个. -你觉得我这个病例和你有什么关系吗?
You think this has something to do with you?

439
00:18:51,595 --> 00:18:53,483
你认为我甚至考虑过你吗?
You think I'm even thinking about your romantic problems?

440
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:55,255
以及你的爱情问题?
I'm trying to help a patient very near and dear to my heart.

441
00:18:55,355 --> 00:18:59,093
我在试图帮助一个 和我非常亲近的病人,

442
00:18:59,193 --> 00:19:02,408
如果需要会诊的话 和你的妻子,或者前妻,抑或情妇,
And if consulting with your wife, your ex, your mistress,

443
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,074
不管她是什么身份 如果这是个问题的话
whatever she becomes, if that's what's needed to save my patient,

444
00:19:04,075 --> 00:19:06,954
我还是会努力去挽救我的病人 不计代价的.
- then I'm damned well going to do it. - I understand that.

445
00:19:07,996 --> 00:19:08,859
我明白.
I deserved that. It's...

446
00:19:10,401 --> 00:19:12,261
我罪有应得.只是... 算了,只不过...
Look, you have put yourself between two very fine women

447
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:16,309
听着,你把你自己放在 两个非常好的女人中间

448
00:19:16,409 --> 00:19:18,009
现在你在试图寻找个简单的方法解决.
and you're looking for an easy way out.

449
00:19:18,361 --> 00:19:20,690
你要用我,或者医院...
You want to use me, the hospital,

450
00:19:21,252 --> 00:19:22,994
或者什么其他人来替你做决定.
somebody to make the decision for you, and it's not gonna happen!

451
00:19:23,094 --> 00:19:24,097
不会成功的.

452
00:19:27,294 --> 00:19:28,156
我可以...
- Could I just say a couple of things? - Just...

453
00:19:28,256 --> 00:19:30,540
-可以让我说一点其他的吗? -别... deh, deh, deh.

454
00:19:37,064 --> 00:19:38,277
你有点吓倒我们了.
You scared us a little there. How's her work-up coming?

455
00:19:39,252 --> 00:19:40,451
她的结果如何?
Electrolytes are within normal limits, urine tox was negative and EKG's fine.

456
00:19:40,881 --> 00:19:42,725
Uh, 电解液正常,

457
00:19:42,825 --> 00:19:44,729
尿氧阴性,e.k.g正常.
Tilt test is scheduled for noon. Oh, and she's on contraceptives.

458
00:19:44,764 --> 00:19:46,142
Tilt测试预约在中午.

459
00:19:46,242 --> 00:19:47,947
Oh,还有她正在吃避孕药.
- So? - That's what I said.

460
00:19:48,286 --> 00:19:49,706
-那又如何? -我也这么问.
That other doctor made such a big deal of it.

461
00:19:50,104 --> 00:19:52,418
另外一个医生对此惊讶不已.

462
00:19:52,853 --> 00:19:53,715
Well,她以前并没有提起.
She didn't tell us before. So I documented it in her med list.

463
00:19:53,815 --> 00:19:55,551
现在我记在她的药物史上了.

464
00:19:56,512 --> 00:19:57,555
什么另一个医生?
- What other doctor? - Cristina. She was wandering the halls.

465
00:19:57,962 --> 00:19:59,961
Cristina.她曾在大厅里闲逛.

466
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,478
好吧,带她下去做个回波.
Fine. Take her down for an echo.

467
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:07,172
回波? 复律法或者切除术如何?
An echo? What about cardioversion or ablation?

468
00:20:07,733 --> 00:20:10,686
我不需要个心脏起博器 或是内部的永久去纤颤器?
Won't I need a pacemaker or a permanent internal defibrillator?

469
00:20:11,024 --> 00:20:13,204
虽然对风湿性心脏病 来说并不常见
Although it would be unusual for rheumatic heart disease

470
00:20:13,304 --> 00:20:15,310
但它可能是导致心律不齐的原因,
to cause ventricular dysrhythmias, we've still got to check your valves.

471
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,603
我们还是会检查一下你的气阀.

472
00:20:21,311 --> 00:20:23,418
我以为你的博士学位 是在药理学领域
I thought your doctorate was in neuropharmacology, not medicine.

473
00:20:23,643 --> 00:20:25,278
-不是临床医学. -就是.
It is.

474
00:20:32,426 --> 00:20:34,788
好消息是Addison给了derek 离婚协议书.
Addison gave Derek divorce papers, which is good.

475
00:20:35,284 --> 00:20:37,232
我是说,她还在这里做她的addison,
I mean, she's still here, being Addison, but it's not like I'm jealous.

476
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,305
但是这并不代表我是嫉妒或者什么.
- That's odd. - It's odd that I'm not jealous?

477
00:20:39,831 --> 00:20:41,659
-这个不成对. -我不嫉妒是不成对的?

478
00:20:42,246 --> 00:20:43,686
不是,你绝对有权嫉妒.
No, you have every right to be jealous.

479
00:20:43,786 --> 00:20:46,015
这是你的地盘,她却到处惹事.
It's your territory and she's peeing all over it. What's odd is Burke's patient.

480
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:47,954
burke的患者竟然不成对的.
Four other hospitals this year. Something's not right.

481
00:20:48,296 --> 00:20:50,179
她今年内还住过其他4家医院.

482
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,292
肯定有什么事情不对.
- Why the interest in Burke's patient? - This has nothing to do with Burke.

483
00:20:51,392 --> 00:20:53,182
你起来对burke的病人 十分有兴趣啊

484
00:20:53,282 --> 00:20:54,562
和 burke无关.
You lost a fallopian tube, a baby, and a boyfriend all in one day.

485
00:20:55,285 --> 00:20:57,217
Cristina,你失去了一个输卵管,一个孩子

486
00:20:57,317 --> 00:20:58,749
还失去了一个男朋友,都在同一天里.
You have the right to be upset.

487
00:20:58,849 --> 00:21:00,059
你绝对有权难过.
You're losing McDreamy to his wife. You have a right to be jealous.

488
00:21:00,377 --> 00:21:02,127
而你正在失去你的"美梦先生" 因为他完美的妻子也在这里.

489
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:03,487
你也有权嫉妒
I did not lose McDreamy. Divorce papers, remember? And I'm not jealous.

490
00:21:03,587 --> 00:21:04,949
我没失去我的"美梦先生".

491
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,400
离婚协议,记得吗? 还有我根本不嫉妒.

492
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,753
我也不难过.
- And I'm not upset. - You really should be in your room.

493
00:21:08,853 --> 00:21:09,848
你真应该回到你的病房去
If this was reversed, would you want to spend time with your mother

494
00:21:10,198 --> 00:21:11,900
okay, 如果情况调换,

495
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,169
你会不会愿意
in a confined room with one window?

496
00:21:13,269 --> 00:21:16,272
和你妈妈一起被关在 一个只有一扇窗户的小房间里?

497
00:21:18,821 --> 00:21:21,517
你觉得我们喜欢他们吗?我们的老妈?
Do you think we're like them? Our mothers?

498
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,273
<i>[Announcement over PA]</i>

499
00:21:25,305 --> 00:21:26,151
James医生...

500
00:21:28,102 --> 00:21:31,814
-你妈妈在哪里? -对极了.
Uh, where's your mom?

501
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,649
Exactly. Where is my mother?

502
00:21:31,837 --> 00:21:34,773
-我妈在哪里? -你妈在哪里?
- Where's your mother? - Funny you should ask.

503
00:21:34,873 --> 00:21:35,708
真有意思你问对了.
Oh, crap.

504
00:21:36,557 --> 00:21:37,328
Oh, 糟了.
Oh, man, you are not going to believe this.

505
00:21:39,722 --> 00:21:41,516
Oh,伙计,你不会相信这个的.

506
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:45,013
不,不可能
No. It can't be. The guy was reading a freaking magazine.

507
00:21:45,113 --> 00:21:46,453
那家伙读一本奇怪的杂志.
It's definitely a bullet. Tracked clear through his head.

508
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,327
绝对是一颗子弹,

509
00:21:48,527 --> 00:21:50,200
一颗沿着清晰的轨迹穿过他的大脑.

510
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:53,903
你们是想继续傻坐在这里
Now are you people just going to sit here or get him into surgery?

511
00:21:54,003 --> 00:21:09,962
还是立刻动手术?

512
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:02,616
你能看到这就是那子弹的痕迹,
Here's the missile track. As you can see it doesn't even cross the midline.

513
00:22:02,716 --> 00:22:04,883
还没穿过中线,他真幸运.
He's lucky. This guy may have even been sitting there talking to you.

514
00:22:04,983 --> 00:22:05,514
她在那里

515
00:22:05,864 --> 00:22:07,763
这人可能还可以 坐在那里和你聊天.
He'll need debridement of the entrance wound and repair the dura,

516
00:22:07,971 --> 00:22:10,866
他的手术需要穿过他的伤口 在内部修复创伤的脑膜

517
00:22:10,917 --> 00:22:12,945
但是我们并不需要取出子弹.
but we won't need to remove the bullet.

518
00:22:13,892 --> 00:22:15,168
精彩的诊断Grey医生.
That's an excellent diagnosis, Dr. Grey.

519
00:22:15,985 --> 00:22:17,613
我是Shepherd医生.我是你的同僚.
I'm Dr. Shepherd, I'm your neuro consult.

520
00:22:19,086 --> 00:22:19,947
Grey医生...
Dr. Grey, they need you upstairs.

521
00:22:21,069 --> 00:22:22,142
楼上的人需要你过去.

522
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,245
你去预定手术室和放射检查?
- You'll book the OR and staff? - I'm on it.

523
00:22:25,495 --> 00:22:26,281
我来.

524
00:22:30,651 --> 00:22:31,874
不可思议.
- Unbelievable. - O'Malley.

525
00:22:31,974 --> 00:22:32,567
O'malley.
Can you not handle this, doctor?

526
00:22:33,881 --> 00:22:35,620
你能不处理这个吗,医生?

527
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,438
好多事情我处理不了.
I can handle a lot of things. Wheelchairs. Come on, Dr. Grey.

528
00:22:42,844 --> 00:22:44,854
没做手术我们是没有把握肯定如此
[Addison] We won't know for sure until we go in there,

529
00:22:44,855 --> 00:22:45,785
但是看起来很像
but it looks like I'm gonna have to take out your pancreas

530
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,069
我要摘除你的胰脏
and re-route your intestines.

531
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:49,289
并且做肠绕道.
Did you tell her my lungs don't do well with anesthesia?

532
00:22:49,815 --> 00:22:52,632
你告诉她我的肺 不太适应麻醉了吗?

533
00:22:52,732 --> 00:22:54,158
我不是一直有你的资料吗?
Don't I always have your back?

534
00:22:54,258 --> 00:22:56,027
你的肾功能衰竭的很快,
Your kidney function is decreasing and I'm afraid

535
00:22:56,127 --> 00:22:58,876
恐怕你会患有多重器官衰竭
you'll go into multi-system organ failure if we don't operate.

536
00:22:58,976 --> 00:22:59,719
如果我们不做这个手术的话.
- If I say no? - There's no guarantees, Jeremiah.

537
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:01,166
如果我说不做呢?

538
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,784
这并没有任何保障,jeremiah.你知道这个.

539
00:23:04,331 --> 00:23:05,894
这将会是一个漫长而艰难的手术
It's going to be a long, hard surgery, and put a lot of stress on your body.

540
00:23:06,323 --> 00:23:08,062
你的身体会承受很大压力.
Yeah, but I'm me.

541
00:23:08,193 --> 00:23:09,239
对,但是我还是我.

542
00:23:11,294 --> 00:23:12,751
但是你还是你
- But you're you. - So if we don't operate, I die.

543
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:15,742
所以如果我不做手术,我就会死

544
00:23:16,472 --> 00:23:20,477
如果我做了手术,我可能还是会死.
And if we do operate, I may die.

545
00:23:21,075 --> 00:23:22,057
基本上来说,对.
Basically, yes.

546
00:23:23,065 --> 00:23:24,980
我喜欢这个失败几率.
Well, I like those odds.

547
00:23:25,607 --> 00:23:27,756
26岁就得了这个病,我真牛,
And 26 years with this disease is awesome. And that's the reality.

548
00:23:27,856 --> 00:23:29,515
这是事实.
So if I get lucky, great.

549
00:23:29,615 --> 00:23:33,086
所以如果我幸运的话,没话说,

550
00:23:34,007 --> 00:23:35,936
如果我不幸的话...
If I don't...

551
00:23:42,215 --> 00:23:43,235
真贴心.
it's been sweet.

552
00:23:44,717 --> 00:23:46,167
我会一直陪着你,一直贴心的.
It's gonna stay sweet.

553
00:23:48,275 --> 00:23:50,393
你理解吗,我们需要 做一个心理评估?
[Derek] We'll need to do a psych evaluation.

554
00:23:50,511 --> 00:23:52,135
我们还需要告诉你几次?
How many times do we have to tell you? He wasn't trying to kill himself.

555
00:23:52,235 --> 00:23:54,556
他并没有想要自杀.

556
00:23:54,949 --> 00:23:57,556
-那是个意外. -他们只是做自己的工作而已, hon.
- It was an accident. - They're just doing their job, hon.

557
00:23:57,656 --> 00:24:00,160
不,他们的工作是让你好起来.
- Their job is to make you better. - Where were you at the time?

558
00:24:00,536 --> 00:24:01,456
枪响的时候你在哪里?
I was in the next room. And I heard the shot. And it was awful.

559
00:24:01,556 --> 00:24:02,340
我在隔壁房间,

560
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,697
-我听到了枪声,真是太可怕了. -Mm-hmm. 抓住这个.

561
00:24:06,797 --> 00:24:07,716
现在都结束了.
- It's over now. - [Alex] Why didn't you call 911?

562
00:24:08,292 --> 00:24:09,856
你为什么没报警?
Because he was only unconscious for a moment.

563
00:24:10,174 --> 00:24:12,970
因为他只是昏迷了一小会 然后就...

564
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:16,209
然后他就.. 可以走 可以说话...
And then he was walking, and talking and...

565
00:24:16,309 --> 00:24:17,698
你应该去报告警察.
You'll have to give a report to the police.

566
00:24:17,798 --> 00:24:18,548
警察?
- Police? - Why do we need to talk to the police?

567
00:24:18,648 --> 00:24:20,554
我们..我们应该和警察说什么?
We have to report any gunshot wounds to the police. It's the law.

568
00:24:20,654 --> 00:24:22,914
我们需要向警察报告 任何一个枪伤患者

569
00:24:23,014 --> 00:24:23,747
是法律.

570
00:24:27,122 --> 00:24:28,020
没事的.

571
00:24:33,601 --> 00:24:35,209
你真是 a.w.o.l.,知道吗.
You're officially AWOL, you know.

572
00:24:35,815 --> 00:24:38,384
我在工作呢,我要做出来
I'm working. Trying to figure out what's going on with the crazy woman on four.

573
00:24:38,484 --> 00:24:40,217
到底那去了4家医院的疯女人怎么回事.
You are the crazy woman on four.

574
00:24:40,317 --> 00:24:41,686
你就是那疯女人.
I made a break for freedom. Hand me that dictionary.

575
00:24:41,786 --> 00:24:43,152
我只是为了自由小小休息一下.

576
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,449
你能把那字典给我吗?

577
00:24:46,245 --> 00:24:48,439
你有一个比我好的病人,
[Sighs] You have a better patient than me and you don't even have a patient.

578
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:49,653
你甚至没有病人.
Meredith's got a CF case. Alex's got the gunshot wound.

579
00:24:50,509 --> 00:24:52,940
Meredith有个 c.f.患者, alex有个枪伤患者,

580
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,803
izzie的患者是神秘的心律不齐.
Izzie's got the mystery arrhythmias. I'm not a nanny.

581
00:24:54,903 --> 00:24:59,015
我并不是个保姆,我是个医生,做手术的医生
I am a surgeon. A cutter.

582
00:24:59,806 --> 00:25:01,734
但是,我现在却得到假标签
But no, I'm getting fake labs for a fake patient so she can do a fake surgery.

583
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:04,666
因为一个假患者, 这样她就可以做一个假医生

584
00:25:08,129 --> 00:25:09,136
她是装出来的.
- She's faking it. - It's real to her. It's Alzheimer's.

585
00:25:10,024 --> 00:25:12,072
对她来说都是真的,alzheimer's.

586
00:25:12,498 --> 00:25:14,993
传教士,Kalpana.
The missionary. Kalpana...

587
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:18,023
oh,天啊
[groans] God! Thank you!

588
00:25:18,123 --> 00:25:19,769
-谢谢. -Ow.
Ow!

589
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:22,186
没必要.
Uncalled for!

590
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:27,390
- Izzie. How have her studies been? - I've been looking for that everywhere.

591
00:25:25,028 --> 00:25:27,832
-Hey, izzie,她的进展如何? -Hey, 我到处找那病历.

592
00:25:27,952 --> 00:25:28,966
阴性, 对吗?
Negative, right?

593
00:25:29,687 --> 00:25:32,600
Oh, 回波测试显示 只是轻微的二尖瓣狭窄而已.
Oh! The echo test showed mild mitral stenosis, the tilt test was negative.

594
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,901
tilt测试也是阴性. 我们正在做 e.p.测试.
We're doing EP studies.

595
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:36,378
我能告诉你她到底怎么了
I know what's wrong without sticking electrodes in her heart.

596
00:25:36,478 --> 00:25:38,169
而且不用把电极粘到她的心里.

597
00:25:38,269 --> 00:25:39,840
是吗? 就凭病历.
- Really. Just by the chart? - No, from the pill she took.

598
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,368
不,凭她吃的药.
They were contraceptives. Why are you so obsessed with this? Just go back to bed.

599
00:25:41,468 --> 00:25:42,734
那是避孕药,cristina.

600
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:45,592
你为什么对这个如此执着? 回到你的床上去.

601
00:25:45,692 --> 00:25:48,132
-我觉得她是在自己骗自己 -你觉得她自己在
- She's doing this to herself. - Inducing ventricular arrhythmias?

602
00:25:48,232 --> 00:25:50,465
诱导心律不齐? 她一定是疯了才这么做.
- She'd have to be crazy. - No, she'd have to have Munchausen's.

603
00:25:50,565 --> 00:25:52,366
不,不,不,不. 她只是需要夸大其词.

604
00:25:52,739 --> 00:25:55,510
Okay, 等一下,你觉得她 在偷偷的吃下什么东西
Wait. You think she's secretly ingesting something to produce real symptoms?

605
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:57,525
来制造出真正的征兆?你认真的吗?
- Seriously? - Yep. Just run it by Burke.

606
00:25:57,625 --> 00:25:59,946
对,告诉burke这件事, 然后再回来告诉我他怎么想的.
- Tell me what he thinks. - Tell him yourself. He's behind you.

607
00:26:00,097 --> 00:26:01,368
你自己告诉他吧,他就站你后面呢.

608
00:26:01,568 --> 00:26:02,520
Burke医生.

609
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:11,759
[Husband and wife talk quietly]

610
00:26:13,682 --> 00:26:14,172
我们说到哪里了?
- Where are we? - OR Two in 30 minutes.

611
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:17,141
2号手术室,30分钟之后 他准备好了,差不多到时候了.
He's prepped, transpo's on the way.

612
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,734
[Woman] Do you understand that? 21 years!

613
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,182
21年
- What's that all about? - I haven't got a clue.

614
00:26:21,282 --> 00:26:22,265
-那是什么? - 多少次

615
00:26:22,365 --> 00:26:23,736
-我也没线索 -需要我道歉吗?
I love you. I forgive you.

616
00:26:23,836 --> 00:26:26,265
我爱你,okay?我原谅你.

617
00:26:26,463 --> 00:26:29,545
你竟然搞外遇,你搞外遇,
You cheated on me. You cheated on me.

618
00:26:29,645 --> 00:26:31,201
你用不着在这里装烈士
- You do not get to play the martyr. - I got a bullet in my head.

619
00:26:31,301 --> 00:26:33,719
-我脑子里有颗子弹. -即使这样也无法让我俩平衡.
- And that doesn't make us even. - You shot me!

620
00:26:33,985 --> 00:26:35,039
你向我开枪.
I think we need to get the police up here right now.

621
00:26:35,308 --> 00:26:36,981
我想我们应该 现在就把警察叫来.

622
00:26:38,568 --> 00:26:40,452
我是说,很明显她喜欢扮演病人.
She obviously loves the patient role. She practically lives in hospitals.

623
00:26:40,552 --> 00:26:42,310
就是说她实践住院
And we're like an imaginary family to her

624
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:45,511
同时...我们这些人 好像是她的假想家人一样

625
00:26:45,611 --> 00:26:47,425
因为她真正的家庭放弃了她
because her real family blows her off to go take care of other people.

626
00:26:47,525 --> 00:26:48,721
而去照顾其他人
- And I saw her take something. - That's not enough.

627
00:26:48,821 --> 00:26:50,502
我看到了她在吃什么药片.

628
00:26:50,602 --> 00:26:51,529
这还不够.
We have to rule out everything else.

629
00:26:52,075 --> 00:26:54,162
我们必须排出其他所有的可能 所有的身体方面患病的可能.

630
00:26:54,262 --> 00:26:56,412
她甚至胡诌了一个职业. 她是药剂师方面的,
She lied about her job. She's a pharmacy tech, not a Ph.D.

631
00:26:56,512 --> 00:26:59,950
-不是博士. -所以她是个骗子,我以前也被骗过.
So she's a liar. I've been lied to before.

632
00:27:02,763 --> 00:27:04,120
喂,我们不能在这里谈这个.
- We're not talking about us here. - Maybe we should be.

633
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,077
-也许我们可以. -我没撒谎.
- I didn't lie. - You withheld the truth.

634
00:27:06,177 --> 00:27:08,683
-你一直隐藏真相,我如何能知道... -好,知道吗?
OK, you know what? I remember you breaking things off with me.

635
00:27:08,783 --> 00:27:10,854
我很清楚的记得 是你先提出和我分手的,

636
00:27:10,954 --> 00:27:12,395
而你并没有因为这个而难过.
You didn't seem so upset about it. This? This is not a relationship.

637
00:27:12,495 --> 00:27:15,191
Okay, 这个... 这不是... 这不是拍拖.

638
00:27:15,291 --> 00:27:17,041
-这不是真的. -Cristina.
- This is not real. - Cristina!

639
00:27:17,141 --> 00:27:18,513
Okay, 那么... 那么即使假扮受伤的戏剧,
OK, and so what's with the big fake display of hurt and drama?

640
00:27:18,613 --> 00:27:20,309
又有什么大不了的?

641
00:27:22,696 --> 00:27:24,348
-Cristina. -我应该躺在床上.
- Cristina! - I'm supposed to be in bed.

642
00:27:24,604 --> 00:27:25,508
Cristina.
Cristina!

643
00:27:41,487 --> 00:27:42,820
警官,谢谢您赶来.
Officers, thanks for coming.

644
00:27:43,811 --> 00:27:44,528
女士,您能坐下吗?
Ma'am, why don't you have a seat? We need to ask you a few questions.

645
00:27:44,605 --> 00:27:45,768
我们需要问你一些问题

646
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:48,305
Oh, 嗯,当然.
Uh, of course.

647
00:27:49,054 --> 00:27:50,867
看起来并不像是场家庭内战
Well, nothing like a domestic dispute to liven up a pre-op, huh?

648
00:27:50,967 --> 00:27:51,945
导致的一个大手术,嗯?

649
00:27:56,419 --> 00:27:57,340
我应该在哪里签字?
- [Jeremiah] Where do I sign? - [Bailey] Here, for consent.

650
00:27:57,646 --> 00:27:58,994
这里,同意签字..

651
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,162
这里是同意d.n.r的签字. 不需要额外抢救.
And here for DNR and no extraordinary measures.

652
00:28:07,954 --> 00:28:09,257
很好,请抬起来一下.
[Bailey] Good. OK, lift up for me.

653
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:16,055
Ow. 你真应该 把我父母叫来.
You should probably call my parents.

654
00:28:17,581 --> 00:28:19,326
你出院的时候自己叫.
Call them yourself when you walk out of here.

655
00:28:27,903 --> 00:28:29,220
Grey医生, 我拿到了这些结果...
Dr. Grey, I have those labs...

656
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:31,955
oh, 不,你没有.
Oh, no you didn't. You lost her again? Again?

657
00:28:32,802 --> 00:28:35,274
你又把她丢了?再一次?

658
00:28:35,374 --> 00:28:38,578
我是个医生,医生.
I am a surgeon. A surgeon!

659
00:28:38,678 --> 00:28:41,655
Yeah, 是啊.当webber医生 发现你又把ellis grey丢了的时候
[Chuckles] Yeah, well.

660
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:42,545
You won't be when Dr. Webber finds out you lost Ellis Grey again.

661
00:28:41,755 --> 00:28:42,916
你就不是个医生了
[Laughs]

662
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:46,587
<i>[Beeping]</i>

663
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:50,059
我们正在使用3种不同的导管.
We're using three different catheters. Why are we doing that, Dr. Stevens?

664
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,564
为什么这么做,Stevens医生?
Programmed electrical stimulation maps the heart's electrical system

665
00:28:51,715 --> 00:28:53,254
检验电极刺激

666
00:28:53,354 --> 00:28:54,752
绘图心脏的电极系统
- to find the focus of the irregular... - Doctors? Sorry to interrupt.

667
00:28:54,852 --> 00:28:56,579
-来找出不规则的中心... -um, 医生?

668
00:28:57,487 --> 00:28:58,586
-打扰一下. -嗯.
- [Burke] Yes? - Her urine's blue.

669
00:28:59,894 --> 00:29:00,748
她的尿样是蓝色的.

670
00:29:02,795 --> 00:29:03,553
什么?
What?

671
00:29:06,376 --> 00:29:07,599
为什么她尿样是蓝色的?
Why is her urine blue?

672
00:29:11,153 --> 00:29:13,532
她说她预约了shepherd医生 的一个手术.
She says she has a surgery scheduled with Dr. Shepherd?

673
00:29:13,632 --> 00:29:14,456
我只不过转身5分钟而已.
- I turned my back for... - Why did you turn your back?

674
00:29:14,556 --> 00:29:15,588
为什么你转身离开?
I told you to take care of her!

675
00:29:15,688 --> 00:29:16,659
我告诉过你照顾她.

676
00:29:22,229 --> 00:29:23,140
你走吧.
Just get out of here.

677
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,992
你想找个带劲的手术,那去找吧.
You want to find a hot surgery, then find one.

678
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:29,932
没你事儿了,我会照顾她的
You're free.

679
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,134
I'll take care of her.

680
00:29:38,437 --> 00:29:39,796
这是个有病的混蛋.
[Alex] This is one sick bastard. We should flip him over, give him a spine.

681
00:29:39,896 --> 00:29:41,576
真应该射穿他,然后刺他一刀.

682
00:29:41,676 --> 00:29:43,944
Karev医生,把牵引器向后拉.
Pull back on the retractor, Dr. Karev. A little suction.

683
00:29:44,044 --> 00:29:45,099
小吸血器?
Covering for his wife after she shot him?

684
00:29:45,199 --> 00:29:47,221
替他老婆遮掩开枪射他

685
00:29:47,321 --> 00:29:48,495
他在外面搞外遇.
- He did cheat on her. - And that's worth a bullet in the head?

686
00:29:49,012 --> 00:29:50,627
对啊,这罪行够 吃颗子弹的了?

687
00:29:52,053 --> 00:29:53,804
感情是建立在牺牲的基础上的.
Relationships are built on sacrifice.

688
00:29:53,904 --> 00:29:56,420
-但不是这种牺牲. -Mm, 我不知道.
- Not that kind of sacrifice. - I don't know.

689
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,199
有时子弹值这个了.
Sometimes a bullet's worth it.

690
00:30:09,719 --> 00:30:10,548
Oh, richard.
Richard, I thought you'd never get here.

691
00:30:11,649 --> 00:30:14,932
我以为你永远不会来这里呢. 看呢,手术室是空的.
Look, the OR's empty, I have a little time before my surgery.

692
00:30:15,214 --> 00:30:16,858
手术之前我还有一点时间.

693
00:30:31,001 --> 00:30:32,486
我不认为我应该来这里
I don't think I'm supposed to be here.

694
00:30:34,728 --> 00:30:35,457
不.
No.

695
00:30:38,368 --> 00:30:39,160
不,你不应该.
No, you're not.

696
00:30:40,712 --> 00:30:43,532
来吧,我带你回病房去
Come on, I'll take you back to your room.

697
00:30:58,403 --> 00:31:00,128
我需要更多的牵引,grey医生.
[Bailey] I need more traction. Dr. Grey?

698
00:31:00,228 --> 00:31:01,945
这里,帮我多抽入一下.
Here, give me some suction there.

699
00:31:04,792 --> 00:31:06,454
现在, grey,把十二指肠放回去.
Grey, retract the duodenum. Good.

700
00:31:07,256 --> 00:31:08,772
好,他怎么样?
How's he doing?

701
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:09,936
呼吸更困难.
- Hard to ventilate and no urine output. - He's shutting down.

702
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:12,354
-从我们开始就没排过尿. -他快不行了.

703
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:13,789
你加大他的压力峰值了吗?
- Did you increase peak pressures? - Any higher, I blow his lungs.

704
00:31:13,889 --> 00:31:15,355
最高了已经,他的肺很受伤.
Bradycardia. Pushing one of atropine.

705
00:31:16,419 --> 00:31:19,218
-心博减慢了. -注射一个单位的阿托品.

706
00:31:20,716 --> 00:31:22,041
试试手动鼓风.
[Addison] Try ventilating him manually, see if he starts coming back up.

707
00:31:22,141 --> 00:31:23,199
看他是否能开始好转.
- [Bailey] Did we miss any bleeders? - Surgical field is clear.

708
00:31:24,271 --> 00:31:26,929
-我们错过什么细节了吗? -过程完全没错.

709
00:31:27,129 --> 00:31:28,176
濒死迹象.
- Agonal rhythm. - [Bailey] Any pulse with that?

710
00:31:28,276 --> 00:31:30,908
-有什么脉搏吗? -颈动脉没反应.
- [Anesthesiologist] No carotid. - Starting CPR. Push one of epi.

711
00:31:31,008 --> 00:31:33,608
Okay, 开始心肺复苏术,注视一单位epi

712
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:36,018
不用额外抢救了,Bailey医生. 他签了d.n.r.
No extraordinary measures, Dr. Bailey. He's DNR.

713
00:31:36,118 --> 00:31:37,407
这是好药啊.
No, this is just good medicine.

714
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:39,456
<i>[Rapid beeping]</i>

蓝色尿样?
Blue urine?

716
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:46,138
二级药物检查为阿莫曲替林阳性.
A second drug screen was positive for amitriptyline,

717
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:50,364
我知道你了解 这个就是造成心律不齐的原因.
which, I'm sure you know, causes ventricular arrhythmias.

718
00:31:50,464 --> 00:31:52,496
你明白一般性的药物检查中 这个结果不会显示,
You knew it wouldn't show on a drug screen,

719
00:31:52,596 --> 00:31:53,853
但是我猜你并没有意识到
but I'm guessing you didn't realize it turns urine blue.

720
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:54,990
它可以让你的尿变蓝.
I didn't do this to myself. You have to believe me. I'm sick.

721
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:56,490
这不是我自己做的.

你们要相信我,我有病.

723

我生病了,而且我还...

你只是看到你期望看到的东西...

727
00:32:08,524 --> 00:32:10,470
浪费我们的时间,资源
Wasting our time, our resources, and throwing away your own life.

728
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:12,247
而且还在放弃你自己的生命.

让我来继续,Bailey医生.

736

Bailey医生,他的肠已经青紫色了.
[Addison] Dr. Bailey, his intestines are cyanotic. There's no blood circulating.

737
00:32:41,771 --> 00:32:43,371
血液停止循环了.
It's been shunted to his brain where he needs it. You call those compressions?

00:32:43,471 --> 00:32:45,402
血液只不过都跑到 最需要的脑子里而已.

It's your call, Dr. Bailey.

It's hard to accept the end when you're too close.

But if there's the slightest chance that he does, I'm not leaving Seattle.

她怎么和警察说的?
What did she tell them?

That you cheated on her, that she was drunk,

759
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:15,047

No. No.

816
00:38:20,013 --> 00:38:20,908
-不! -不!
[Both] No!

817
00:38:22,756 --> 00:38:24,733
我已经试过了,只会让情况更糟.
I already tried that. It just made it worse.

818
00:38:25,101 --> 00:38:27,876
我知道她或早或晚都会崩溃的 不过是时间的问题.
I knew she'd break sooner or later. Just a matter of time.

819
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:30,254
我要杀了她!
I will kill her!

820
00:38:31,331 --> 00:38:32,565
我是她妈妈.
I am her mother.

821
00:38:32,665 --> 00:38:34,910
我们这里对待妈妈不是太好.
We don't do well with mothers here. Why don't you leave and come back later?

822
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,775
你为什么不离开一下过会再回来?

823
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,127
Cristina.
Cristina.

824
00:38:40,227 --> 00:38:43,567
让这停止..让这停止啊
Make it stop. Make it stop.

825
00:38:45,391 --> 00:38:47,324
谁给我点镇静剂!
Somebody sedate me! [sobs]

826
00:38:51,778 --> 00:38:54,526
有时候, 现实有点鬼祟
<i>[Meredith] Sometimes reality has a way</i> <i>of sneaking up and biting us in the ass.</i>

827
00:38:54,626 --> 00:38:55,924
在我们背后袭击我们...

828
00:38:59,623 --> 00:39:00,848
当大坝决口的时候,
<i>And when the dam bursts</i> <i>all you can do is swim.</i>

829
00:39:00,877 --> 00:39:02,532
你所能做的,就是游泳

830
00:39:08,001 --> 00:39:11,476
伪装的世界是一个鸟笼,而不是蚕茧.
<i>The world of pretend is a cage,</i> <i>not a cocoon.</i>

831
00:39:14,911 --> 00:39:17,403
我们只能跟自己长时间的撒谎.
<i>We can only lie to ourselves</i> <i>for so long.</i>

832
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,512
[& Merrick: <i>Infinity]</i>

833
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:35,177
我们都很疲惫.
<i>We are tired. We are scared.</i>

834
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,998
我们也很恐惧.
<i>Denying it doesn't change the truth.</i>

835
00:39:37,888 --> 00:39:39,721
否认并不能改变事实.

836
00:39:51,283 --> 00:39:53,176
Hi. Tate太太?
Hi, Mrs. Tate?

837
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:56,823
我是miranda.Miranda bailey.
It's Miranda. Miranda Bailey.

838
00:39:56,923 --> 00:40:01,469
我打电话是因为jeremiah.

839
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,594
I'm calling about Jeremiah.

840
00:40:07,194 --> 00:40:08,229
非常抱歉
I'm so sorry.

841
00:40:48,137 --> 00:40:49,485
她不想被碰
She doesn't want to be touched.

842
00:41:15,928 --> 00:41:19,354
或迟或早,我们必须 把我们的否认放一边
<i>[Meredith] Sooner or later,</i> <i>we have to put aside our denial</i>

843
00:41:21,066 --> 00:41:24,774
面对迎面而来的世界,炙热的燃烧
<i>and face the world head-on,</i> <i>guns blazing.</i>

844
00:41:32,701 --> 00:41:33,426
Hi.
- Hi. - Hey.

845
00:41:34,202 --> 00:41:35,116
-Hi. -你看起来不错.
- You look great. - Thanks.

846
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:36,348
谢谢
- Are you OK? - Yeah, you ready to go?

847
00:41:37,065 --> 00:41:37,584
Yeah.

848
00:41:37,684 --> 00:41:38,974
-你没事吧? -嗯,可以走了吗?

849
00:41:40,543 --> 00:41:43,859
Yeah, 你... 你只是... 你看起来不太像你自己了.
Yeah, you just... You don't seem like yourself.

850
00:41:43,997 --> 00:41:47,098
不. Uh, 我们预定了晚餐的位置了.
No. Look, we got dinner reservations. We should go so, let's go.

851
00:41:47,198 --> 00:41:48,077
我们应该走了. 那么, uh...
OK.

852
00:41:48,607 --> 00:41:49,640
-走吧. -Okay.
<i>[Meredith] Denial. It's not just a river</i> <i>in Egypt. It's a freaking ocean.</i>

853
00:41:50,959 --> 00:41:53,771
否认... 不仅仅只是埃及的一条河流而已.

854
00:41:54,253 --> 00:41:55,791
那是个怪异的海洋.

855
00:41:57,684 --> 00:41:58,655
真高兴我们这样
I'm glad we're doing this.

856
00:41:59,378 --> 00:42:01,615
我也是,想喝点什么吗?
Me too. Want a drink?

857
00:42:01,715 --> 00:42:02,959
Yes. Oh.
- Yes. Oh... - That's OK, I got it.

858
00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:04,169
-我来 -我来.
I'll get it.

859
00:42:15,012 --> 00:42:17,697
那么你如何从中逃生呢?
<i>[Meredith] So how do you</i> <i>keep from drowning in it?</i>
