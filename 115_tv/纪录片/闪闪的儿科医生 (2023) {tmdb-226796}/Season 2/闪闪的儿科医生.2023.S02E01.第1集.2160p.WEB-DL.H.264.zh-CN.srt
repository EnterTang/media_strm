00:00:01,046 --> 00:00:03,130
前季回顾
<i>[narrator]</i> <i>Last season on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

3
00:00:03,231 --> 00:00:05,918
你该走了. 我要迟到了. 我说真的. 再见...
You have to go. l'm late. Seriously. Goodbye... uh...

4
00:00:07,964 --> 00:00:09,617
- Derek. - 是的.
- Derek. - Yeah.

5
00:00:10,871 --> 00:00:13,857
一个月以前你们在医学院，医生教你们.
A month ago you were in med school being taught by doctors.

6
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:16,807
现在你们是医生了.
- Today, you are the doctors. - [Bailey] You're interns. Grunts.

7
00:00:16,908 --> 00:00:20,967
你们是实习医生, 新兵, 什么都不是 外科的食物链的最底层.

8
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:21,151
Nobodies. Bottom of the surgical food chain.

9
00:00:21,068 --> 00:00:23,869
像糖果一样, 但是有血, 比糖果好多了.
lt's like candy, but with blood, which is so much better.

10
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,475
Shepherd医生在那里.
Dr. Shepherd? He's over there.

11
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:29,222
这里有谁觉得自己不知道在做什么?
[George] Who feels like they have no idea what they're doing?

12
00:00:29,639 --> 00:00:32,129
- 别这样看着我. - 怎么样看了?
- Stop looking at me like that. - Like what?

13
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:33,676
像你看着我裸体一样.
Like you've seen me naked.

14
00:00:33,907 --> 00:00:36,036
我不是因为和我老板睡觉才被选进外科的
l don't get picked 'cause l slept with my boss

15
00:00:36,137 --> 00:00:38,468
我不是因为有一个有名的妈妈才进医学院的.
and didn't get into med school 'cause l have a famous mother.

16
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:40,843
我想我以前是一个医生.
l used to be a doctor, l think.

17
00:00:40,944 --> 00:00:43,516
好吧,George 和Izzie, 你们可以搬进来了.
[Meredith] Fine, George and lzzie, you can move in.

18
00:00:43,772 --> 00:00:46,224
你和我分手仅仅是因为一瓶tequila（龙舌兰酒）
[Derek] You blew me off for a bottle of tequila.

19
00:00:46,818 --> 00:00:48,589
意识到真相真是没有什么好处.
lt's not nearly as much fun to wake up to.

20
00:00:49,993 --> 00:00:51,997
你们不介意把车挪一下吧?
You mind movin' this tail wagon?

21
00:00:52,098 --> 00:00:55,095
下次我再看到你以任何方式对Meredith Grey表示出好感,
The next time l see you favoring Meredith Grey in any way,

22
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:58,168
我保证让她一个月进不了手术室.
l'll make sure she doesn't see the inside of an OR for a month.

23
00:00:58,269 --> 00:00:59,361
你要知道，我是你的上司.
- l'm your boss. - You don't scare me.

24
00:00:59,462 --> 00:01:00,811
你不用吓我.

25
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,128
你应该知道 Richard 同时向我们两个人 承诺说要提拔我们当主任.
- Richard promised chief to both of us. - Keep friends close and enemies closer.

26
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,969
善待朋友，更要善待敌人.

27
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,258
早上好,模特医生.
- Morning, Dr. Model. - Dr. Evil Spawn.

28
00:01:06,884 --> 00:01:07,648
恶魔之子医生.
You're not the enemy. You're just the competition.

29
00:01:07,749 --> 00:01:08,851
你不是敌人.

30
00:01:09,321 --> 00:01:10,575
你只是竞争对像.

31
00:01:11,428 --> 00:01:13,561
我们在干吗?
What is this that we're doing here?

32
00:01:13,731 --> 00:01:15,159
你需要弄清楚吗?
[Yang] You need a definition?

33
00:01:16,526 --> 00:01:18,099
还有别的选择.
[Meredith] There are other options.

34
00:01:20,944 --> 00:01:23,621
这个是肿瘤, 它压迫了你的视神经.
lt's a tumor. lt's pressing against your optic nerve.

35
00:01:23,722 --> 00:01:24,511
你得梅毒了.
You've got syphilis.

36
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,474
我不知道是怎么得的.
[George] l don't know how this happened.

37
00:01:26,749 --> 00:01:27,802
你和 Alex?
You and Alex?

38
00:01:28,393 --> 00:01:30,105
你把梅毒传染给我的?!
You gave me syphilis?

39
00:01:31,197 --> 00:01:33,037
有人说这个是艳情.
[Derek] Some people would call this a relationship.

40
00:01:33,138 --> 00:01:34,688
- 谁? - 我.
- Who? - Me.

41
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:36,752
哦，我的天.
My God, you're falling for him.

42
00:01:36,853 --> 00:01:38,056
你爱上他了

43
00:01:38,157 --> 00:01:40,760
是什么能让一个好医生放弃优厚的待遇到西雅图来?
What makes a hotshot doc leave the Big Apple?

44
00:01:41,455 --> 00:01:44,082
- 你好，我是Addison Shepherd. - Shepherd?
- Hi. l'm Addison Shepherd. - Shepherd?

45
00:01:44,232 --> 00:01:47,017
你就是那个勾引我丈夫的女人吧.
You must be the woman who's been screwing my husband.

46
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:53,855
要成为一个好的外科大夫 你必须像外科大夫那样思考.
<i>[Meredith] To be a good surgeon</i>, <i>you have to think like a surgeon</i>.

47
00:01:54,165 --> 00:01:55,895
情感是凌乱的.
<i>Emotions are messy</i>.

48
00:01:55,996 --> 00:01:59,554
把它们整齐地藏好步入无菌室
<i>Tuck them neatly away</i> <i>and step into a clean, sterile room</i>

49
00:01:59,655 --> 00:02:01,417
一个程序简单的地方...
<i>where the procedure is simple</i>.

50
00:02:02,492 --> 00:02:04,873
切开,缝合,关上.
<i>Cut, suture and close</i>.

51
00:02:07,942 --> 00:02:09,287
你看上去很眼熟.
You look familiar. You been here before?

52
00:02:09,388 --> 00:02:10,300
你以前来过?

53
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:11,556
来过一次.
Once. That worked out really well.

54
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:13,340
这酒很管用.

55
00:02:14,374 --> 00:02:16,772
只有两件事
l know that look. lt's one of two things.

56
00:02:16,873 --> 00:02:19,863
你老板让你不爽,或者是你男朋友. 是哪个?
Either your boss is giving you hell or your boyfriend is. Which is it?

57
00:02:20,477 --> 00:02:21,229
都是.
Both.

58
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,624
但是有时你要面对一个不会愈合的伤口
<i>But sometimes</i>, <i>you're faced with a cut that won't heal</i>.

59
00:02:26,234 --> 00:02:29,314
我男朋友是我的老板, 这曾经是个问题.
My boyfriend is my boss, which was a problem.

60
00:02:29,543 --> 00:02:33,748
但是比起我的男朋友有个老婆的事实还算不上什么.
But not as big a problem as the fact that my boyfriend has a wife.

61
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:34,959
告诉你吧,
Tell you what, this one, it's on the house.

62
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,933
这杯是免费的.

63
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:40,842
一个伤口的线开了,敞开着.
<i>A cut that rips its stitches wide open</i>.

64
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,208
Addison, 你在这里干嘛?
- What are you doing here? - Your hair's different.

65
00:02:43,309 --> 00:02:44,175
你的发型变了.

66
00:02:44,276 --> 00:02:48,140
- 很多事情都不一样了. - 比以前长了.我很喜欢,很像Russell Crowe.
- A lot of things are different. - lt's longer. lt's very Russell Crowe.

67
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:49,832
- 你在这里干嘛? - 你在这里干嘛?
- What are you doing here? - You just pick up and leave everything?

68
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:51,264
你把你拥有的都扔掉了

69
00:02:51,402 --> 00:02:53,186
你的房子, 你的事业, 你的朋友?
Your house, your practice, your friends? You had a life in Manhattan.

70
00:02:53,287 --> 00:02:55,633
- 在曼哈顿你曾经有你的生活. - 曾经.

71
00:02:56,762 --> 00:02:59,109
现在你在西雅图有了个女友.
Had.

72
00:02:57,243 --> 00:03:00,178
And now you have a girlfriend in Seattle.

73
00:03:00,679 --> 00:03:02,127
她看起来... 很甜.
- She seems sweet. - The ice you're on. Thin.

74
00:03:02,228 --> 00:03:04,517
你很...心虚.

75
00:03:04,694 --> 00:03:05,910
她很年轻
She's young.

76
00:03:06,034 --> 00:03:08,792
她睁着大大的眼睛, "哦, 他是个脑外医生" 事情就发生了
That wide-eyed, he's-a-brain-surgeon thing, but still sweet.

77
00:03:08,893 --> 00:03:11,260
但还是很甜, 正是你期待的那样, 对吗?
Which was what you were going for. The anti-Addison?

78
00:03:11,361 --> 00:03:12,410
反Addison?
lf you came to try to win me back, forget it.

79
00:03:12,511 --> 00:03:14,859
你如果来这里是想重新得到我, 你休想

80
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,787
我是的. 我横跨全国飞过来去回忆
l did. l flew across the country to reminisce over wedding photos,

81
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:22,011
结婚照片, 醉酒, 跌在床上, 让你认识到你不能离开我.
get drunk, fall into bed, and make you realize you can't live without me.

82
00:03:23,147 --> 00:03:24,867
放松,Derek.
Relax. Derek, l'm here for work.

83
00:03:24,968 --> 00:03:26,038
我是来这里工作的.
l'm helming the TTTS case you guys admitted last week

84
00:03:26,364 --> 00:03:28,868
我接管你们上周接受的T.T.T.S病例

85
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:32,302
- 根据Richard的简报,我应该是... - Richard 知道你来这里?
and from Richard's briefing...

86
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,406
- He knew you were coming? - He asked me. Didn't he say?

87
00:03:32,403 --> 00:03:33,334
他让我来的.
- No. He didn't. - Hm. Surprise.

88
00:03:33,435 --> 00:03:34,875
- 他没有告诉你? - 不，他没有.

89
00:03:34,976 --> 00:03:36,352
惊讶吧.

90
00:03:38,165 --> 00:03:39,402
这头发, 尽管...
The hair, though. You know l've always had a thing for Russell Crowe.

91
00:03:39,577 --> 00:03:42,080
你知道我一直都喜欢Russell Crowe.

92
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:48,408
让我看看.
Let me see it.

93
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,425
没有伤口, 一般性肿胀.
No lacerations, minimal swelling.

94
00:03:52,526 --> 00:03:54,001
George 真是把你揍得不轻
- George really knocked you around. - He's a lightweight.

95
00:03:54,102 --> 00:03:54,978
那家伙是个轻量级.
- Could've pinned him in a second. - Why didn't you?

96
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,686
我想揍他马上就可以揍

97
00:03:56,787 --> 00:03:57,983
是啊, 但是你为什么不揍呢?
Are you kidding? l'm riding a career in Plastics all the way to the bank.

98
00:03:58,084 --> 00:03:58,813
你开玩笑吗?

99
00:03:58,914 --> 00:04:01,265
我想当整形科医生.

100
00:04:01,793 --> 00:04:03,391
损伤了我这对宝贝手我可担负不了
Can't afford to injure these babies.

101
00:04:05,016 --> 00:04:06,391
特别是用在O'Malley这种人身上.
- Especially over O'Malley. - You had it coming.

102
00:04:06,492 --> 00:04:07,283
你自找的.
The dude punches like my sister.

103
00:04:07,384 --> 00:04:09,108
那家伙打人的力气像我妹妹一样.

104
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:12,750
哦,照你的说法, 你被一个女孩扁了?
So, by your definition then you got beat up by a girl.

105
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:13,950
[chuckles]

106
00:04:16,285 --> 00:04:17,739
大家都来欢呼吧!
- All hail the champ! - [whooping]

107
00:04:19,323 --> 00:04:21,247
这么说我们的Alex终于罪有应得了?
So my guy Alex finally got what was coming to him.

108
00:04:21,348 --> 00:04:23,207
George一拳就把他打倒了.
- George knocked him down in one punch. - l don't want to talk about it!

109
00:04:23,308 --> 00:04:24,009
你应该看看.
Brag, champ, brag! You've earned it!

110
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:24,893
我不想说这个了.

111
00:04:24,994 --> 00:04:27,433
好好吹吹吧.应该的.

112
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:28,741
来瓶啤酒?
Can l have a beer, please?

113
00:04:30,173 --> 00:04:32,975
咱们赌谁最倒霉吧.
Let's play a game of whose life sucks the most.

114
00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:34,541
我会赢的.
- l'll win. l always win. - No, you don't want to play with me.

115
00:04:35,105 --> 00:04:37,202
- 我总是赢. - 你不会想和我赌这个的

116
00:04:37,542 --> 00:04:38,562
我就要赌.
Oh, l do. l'll even go first.

117
00:04:38,999 --> 00:04:40,379
我还要第一个说.

118
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,794
Derek结过婚.
Derek's married.

119
00:04:44,695 --> 00:04:48,109
George, 啤酒从你的鼻孔滴下来.
George, beer is dripping from your nostrils.

120
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:51,324
我说过我会赢.
- Told you l'd win. - No, you don't win.

121
00:04:52,765 --> 00:04:53,930
不,你没有赢.

122
00:04:55,432 --> 00:04:56,512
你听到我了没有?
Did you hear me? l said Derek is married.

123
00:04:56,851 --> 00:04:58,505
我说Derek结过婚了.
As in pigheaded, adulterous, liar married.

124
00:04:58,982 --> 00:05:02,553
这个猪头, 通奸的, 骗子是结过婚的.

125
00:05:02,654 --> 00:05:04,493
你说什么都不可能超过这个了.
Nothing you could say could top that.

126
00:05:05,033 --> 00:05:06,296
我怀孕了.
l'm pregnant.

127
00:05:07,976 --> 00:05:08,985
我赢了.
l win.

128
00:05:10,073 --> 00:05:11,195
Joe, 你没事吧?
- [groans] - [man] Joe, you all right?

129
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,744
- [smashing] - [man] Hey, Joe!

130
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,450
可能是Joe赢了.
OK. Maybe Joe wins.

131
00:05:26,306 --> 00:05:27,703
Joe, 躺下.
- Lie down. - [man] The medics are coming.

132
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:29,406
你们叫警察了?
- You called the gurney patrol? - Sit back and relax.

133
00:05:29,507 --> 00:05:30,682
坐好放松.
- The hospital will run some tests... - Tests? l don't need tests. l'm fine!

134
00:05:30,783 --> 00:05:32,715
我们要把你送到医院做一些检查.

135
00:05:32,816 --> 00:05:34,442
检查? 不. 我不需要任何检查,我很好.
You collapsed! On the floor. lt's your bar. You know how filthy this floor is.

136
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:36,432
伙计,你瘫倒在地板上了.

137
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:38,417
这你的酒吧.你知道这里的地板有多脏.

138
00:05:38,518 --> 00:05:40,720
- 脉博有力. - 小范围颅骨挫伤.
- Pulse is strong. - Minor skull contusions.

139
00:05:40,821 --> 00:05:42,716
- 你和人上床了? - 什么? 谁?
- You're sleeping with someone? - What?

140
00:05:42,817 --> 00:05:45,279
这有什么奇怪的? george都有做这种事.
- Even George got some action. - Correction. George got some syphilis.

141
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,765
没错. George 得梅毒了.
- How could l not know? - Forget this.

142
00:05:46,866 --> 00:05:48,597
你和别人上床了我怎么不知道?

143
00:05:48,698 --> 00:05:51,796
算了吧. 医院就在路对面.
The hospital is right across the street.

144
00:05:51,897 --> 00:05:54,411
我怎么都相信我能自己走到马路对面.
l can sure as hell walk across the street by myself.

145
00:05:54,512 --> 00:05:57,389
-我想我们应该... -不，我来吧. Joe!
- l think we should... - No, l got him. Joe!

146
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,945
好吧,详细一点.
All right.

147
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,286
Details. You're pregnant?

148
00:06:04,046 --> 00:06:05,103
你怀孕了?
What are you gonna do?

149
00:06:05,204 --> 00:06:06,358
你打算怎么办?
Look, you know what happens to pregnant interns.

150
00:06:07,463 --> 00:06:09,602
你知道实习生怀孕了会怎么样.

151
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:14,091
我可不要去妇科或者整天和丘疹打交道
l'm not switching to the vagina squad or spending my life popping zits.

152
00:06:14,192 --> 00:06:15,360
我太有天赋了.
l'm too talented. Surgery's my life.

153
00:06:15,461 --> 00:06:16,374
外科是我的生活.
Which begs the question: Who are you sleeping with?

154
00:06:16,475 --> 00:06:19,692
- 别回避话题, 你和谁上床了? - 一个男的.

155
00:06:19,793 --> 00:06:20,978
就这些？
- Just a guy. - That's all l get?

156
00:06:22,368 --> 00:06:26,036
- 你不能把这个事情告诉我了又想让我不管. - 那就盯着我吧.
You can't just bring something like this up and expect me to drop it.

157
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:26,718
Well, watch me.

158
00:06:28,098 --> 00:06:29,129
你今天晚上怎么回来了?
Don't you have a date with McDreamy?

159
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,784
- 你不是在和梦幻麦克约会吗? - 大概是已婚麦克吧.
- More like McMarried. - McWhat?

160
00:06:31,885 --> 00:06:32,619
麦克什么?
l came to check on Joe.

161
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,298
我来看看Joe.
- You think he's gonna be OK? - Will he need an operation?

162
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:35,675
你认为他应该会没有事吧?

163
00:06:35,776 --> 00:06:37,325
你觉得他需要手术吗?
[Derek] Operation, yes. OK, hard to tell.

164
00:06:37,426 --> 00:06:38,727
手术... 是的.

165
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,296
不太好说.
Basilar artery's like a balloon. Subarachnoid bleeding.

166
00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:42,842
基底动脉涨的像气球一样, 蛛网膜下腔出血

167
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,891
动脉瘤想高尔夫球一样大.
- Aneurysm the size of a golf ball. - No way to clip something like that.

168
00:06:45,243 --> 00:06:46,871
没有办法用血管钳夹住它.
- Not without magic fingers. - Or a standstill operation.

169
00:06:46,972 --> 00:06:48,188
除非有魔术手指.

170
00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:49,706
或者是静止手术.
You're doing a standstill... He's doing a standstill operation.

171
00:06:50,122 --> 00:06:54,176
你要做静止手术... 他要做静止手术.

172
00:06:54,277 --> 00:06:54,996
我想试试.
l'd like to try. First l need some additional patient history,

173
00:06:55,097 --> 00:07:00,030
但是首先我需要一些病例资料, 通宵实验室和脑部诊断.

174
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:59,482
overnight labs, and a cerebral angio.

175
00:07:01,006 --> 00:07:01,880
我喝醉了.
- l'm drunk. - [Derek] Meredith...

176
00:07:01,981 --> 00:07:02,914
Meredith...

177
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,620
混蛋麦克.
[lzzie, softly] McBastard.

178
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,262
Ahem.

179
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:19,779
你在干嘛？
- What are you doing? - Uh...

180
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:24,990
我站在她一边, 但是我们在讨论静止手术的可能性.
l am on her side. But we're talking a possible standstill here.

181
00:07:25,091 --> 00:07:26,045
考虑.
Recognize.

182
00:07:29,588 --> 00:07:30,296
Meredith.
- Meredith! - Go away!

183
00:07:30,397 --> 00:07:31,855
- 走开. - 等下.
Just wait. We should discuss this.

184
00:07:32,188 --> 00:07:33,127
我们需要谈谈
Here's a thought. No! Quit following me!

185
00:07:33,228 --> 00:07:34,097
我有一个想法.

186
00:07:34,198 --> 00:07:35,789
不. 别跟着我.
- At least let me explain. - Explain?

187
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,623
听我解释下好吧.

188
00:07:38,037 --> 00:07:40,311
解释? 你知道应该什么时候解释吗?
You should have explained the night we met in the bar.

189
00:07:40,412 --> 00:07:43,376
我们在酒吧里见到的晚上 在任何事情发生以前.
Before any of the rest of it.

190
00:07:43,477 --> 00:07:45,490
是的，那时解释才是合适的.
- That would have been a good time. - Look, l know how you feel.

191
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:47,013
我知道你的感觉.
Do you? Somehow l doubt that.

192
00:07:47,323 --> 00:07:48,022
你知道?

193
00:07:48,123 --> 00:07:49,535
我才不相信.
Because if you did, you would shut up,

194
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:54,288
如果你知道, 你应该闭嘴 转身回去,

195
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,902
and you would turn around and go back inside,

196
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:58,183
你应该知道我马上就要进我的车里
because you would realize that l am this close to getting in my car

197
00:07:58,284 --> 00:08:00,513
我会在停车场把你撞倒!
and running you down in the parking lot!

198
00:08:03,697 --> 00:08:04,586
给我钥匙.
- Where're your keys? - l'm fine!

199
00:08:04,698 --> 00:08:06,546
- 我很好. - Meredith, 给我钥匙.
Meredith, give me your keys.

200
00:08:07,668 --> 00:08:08,850
咱们走，好吗?
[George] Let's go home.

201
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,681
[man and woman laugh]

202
00:08:14,075 --> 00:08:15,874
这个丈夫是最差劲的.
- ...and the husband was the... - [Richard laughs]

203
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,135
[clears throat]

204
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,331
[sighs, clears throat]

205
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:30,681
我早上回来再汇报我的工作
Well, l will be back in the morning to report for duty.

206
00:08:31,114 --> 00:08:34,624
你休息一下.
And you... get some rest.

207
00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:41,596
她在这里干嘛?
What is she doing here?

208
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,332
你我都知道她在她的领域里是最强的.
You and l both know she's the best in the field.

209
00:08:46,113 --> 00:08:49,286
引进Addie是医院的决定,没有私情
Bringing Addie out was a business decision, nothing personal.

210
00:08:49,387 --> 00:08:51,734
多么轻松的事啊.
Oh, well, what a relief.

211
00:08:51,844 --> 00:08:52,926
这个不是私事.
lt's not personal. lt is personal to me.

212
00:08:53,484 --> 00:08:54,432
这对我来说是私事.
The workings of my surgical unit don't have any...

213
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:56,585
在我的手术组里工作

214
00:08:56,686 --> 00:08:58,150
-别弄出任何事情... -别把我老婆搅和进去!
- Don't include my wife! - Don't include your private life!

215
00:08:58,251 --> 00:09:00,824
别把你的私生活弄进去.

216
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:09,959
Burke会代理主任直到我回来.
Burke will act as chief of surgery until l'm back on my feet.

217
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,149
你让Burke当主任?
You gave chief to Burke.

218
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,036
我说过,要成为主任医师就不要闹私人情绪.
There's no room for personal in being chief.

219
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,119
你这么说是什么意思?
- What is that supposed to mean? - You have been sleeping with an intern.

220
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,167
你和实习生上床有多长时间了?

221
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:20,815
[chuckles]

222
00:09:22,197 --> 00:09:24,411
我猜成为主任并不是完全没是有私情的
So l guess part of being chief is personal.

223
00:09:26,235 --> 00:09:27,669
你出去的时候把门关上.
Close the door on your way out.

224
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,019
Allis.
L.S.

225
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,781
<i>[woman on PA]</i> <i>IV nurse call ICU, extension 323</i>.

226
00:09:48,537 --> 00:09:49,543
Babcock.
Babcock.

227
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:51,850
<i>IV nurse call ICU, extension 323</i>.

228
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:54,065
直角钳.
Right-angle clamp.

229
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,913
我弄完了会消毒的.
Oh. l'm gonna sterilize everything when l'm done.

230
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,834
器械护士都不会知道我在这里.
The scrub nurses won't know l was here.

231
00:10:00,415 --> 00:10:01,931
我守口如瓶.
My lips are sealed.

232
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:05,364
<i>Dr. Tucker to Radiology</i>. <i>Dr. Tucker to Radiology</i>.

233
00:10:07,793 --> 00:10:10,326
我有一个问题要问.
So, l have a question to ask.

234
00:10:11,254 --> 00:10:15,814
我看了时间安排，咱们两个今天晚上都不用值班
l checked the schedule and l noticed that you and l are both off tonight.

235
00:10:16,236 --> 00:10:17,547
我为晚餐预订了位置.
l made reservations.

236
00:10:18,298 --> 00:10:20,150
一个我很喜欢的餐馆.
l have a favorite restaurant.

237
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,155
这些都不算是问题.
None of those were questions.

238
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,615
你愿意今天晚上和我出去吃饭吗?
Would you like to go out to dinner with me tonight?

239
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:40,768
手术室是我唯一可以去的和思考的地方..
You know, the OR is the one place where l can come and think.

240
00:10:43,526 --> 00:10:45,219
我现在正在思考，行不行？
l'm thinking right now, OK?

241
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,742
好吧.
Of course.

242
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:50,245
[metal scrapes]

243
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:51,911
我明白了.
l get it.

244
00:10:57,714 --> 00:10:59,236
我不是一个暴力的人.
l'm not a violent person. l'm a pacifist.

245
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,196
我是个和平主义者, 但是, 你知道
But, you know, he just kept pushing and push...

246
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,737
他不停的弄我
He pushed me, l pushed back.

247
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:06,272
他弄我, 我也返过来弄他.
l was pushed. And now he...

248
00:11:06,815 --> 00:11:09,372
我被他弄,而他现在

249
00:11:09,473 --> 00:11:12,184
你知道吗? Alex 再想把你怎么样，就告诉我
lf Alex tries to lay a hand on you, just tell me, l'll take care of it.

250
00:11:12,285 --> 00:11:13,232
我会处理的.
You... [laughs]

251
00:11:15,057 --> 00:11:16,647
我不需要你...
l don't need you to take care of it.

252
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:17,742
管这件事.
lf Alex starts something l'll handle it myself.

253
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,111
如果Alex来找事，我自己解决.

254
00:11:20,866 --> 00:11:22,030
我能处理.
l can handle it.

255
00:11:22,981 --> 00:11:24,499
好了大伙，有任务了.
OK, people, assignments.

256
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,990
Yang,你今天休息.
Yang, you're on discharges. O'Malley report to room E1 9.

257
00:11:26,091 --> 00:11:27,788
O'Malley,到E19房报道.
Grey come see me, and who was on call last night?

258
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:31,833
Grey,来见我,昨天晚上谁值班?

259
00:11:31,934 --> 00:11:33,684
邋遢, 邋遢,邋遢.
Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy.

260
00:11:33,785 --> 00:11:37,435
- 重新做这些然后午饭前把它们给我, 明白吗? - 明白.
Redo these and return them to me before lunch, understood?

261
00:11:37,535 --> 00:11:38,940
Karev,别试我.
- Understood. - Karev, don't tempt me.

262
00:11:39,538 --> 00:11:40,943
有人受欢迎.
- Somebody's popular. - Meaning?

263
00:11:41,317 --> 00:11:42,061
什么意思?
There's been a special request, just for you.

264
00:11:42,162 --> 00:11:44,511
有一个对你的特别要求.

265
00:11:44,847 --> 00:11:46,699
这些主任医师全都要管?
[Burke] The chief runs through all of this?

266
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,769
在午饭前.
Before lunch. After, you've got calls to return, a budget to approve,

267
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:51,249
然后, 你要回电话, 批准预算,

268
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:55,365
两个员工会议,四个Richard的手术, 包括你的.
two staff meetings, and four of Richard's surgeries, including your own.

269
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,534
没有问题.
Absolutely. No problem.

270
00:11:58,039 --> 00:11:59,062
新手...
[chuckles] Virgins.

271
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:01,448
祝贺词都到位了.
So. Congratulations are in order.

272
00:12:01,549 --> 00:12:03,959
别吓我了, Shepherd. 我就当你的老板几天.
Don't sweat it, l'll only be your boss for a few days.

273
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,600
我很了解Richard的康复时间.
l'm aware of Richard's recovery time. l operated on him, remember?

274
00:12:05,701 --> 00:12:07,526
我给他做的手术，不记得了?

275
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:08,261
我记得.
l do. He survived and chose me to take over while recruiting your wife.

276
00:12:08,362 --> 00:12:11,647
你给他做手术,他手术后选我代理他 还雇用你老婆

277
00:12:11,748 --> 00:12:13,250
很清楚，他脑子有毛病.
Clearly, he has brain damage.

278
00:12:13,351 --> 00:12:14,666
还是你的前妻?
Or is it your ex-wife? l'm a little fuzzy on that.

279
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,016
我在弄不清这个事情.
- We're separated. - Sorry to interrupt, Dr. Burke.

280
00:12:16,117 --> 00:12:17,358
我们分居了.

281
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:19,614
对不起打扰了,Burke医生.

282
00:12:19,715 --> 00:12:21,453
- 没关系. - 她总是很烦人.
- You're never interrupting. - She always is.

283
00:12:21,554 --> 00:12:22,619
我正在查看
l was checking to see if Dr. Burke secured the intern...

284
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,005
- Burke是否提供了 - 你要的实习生.

285
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:27,341
The intern you requested? He did.

286
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,479
他提供了.

287
00:12:42,477 --> 00:12:43,564
T.T.T.S的定义.
[Addison] Define TTTS.

288
00:12:43,665 --> 00:12:46,372
双胞胎输血综合症, 连在一起的孪生双胞胎.
Twin-twin transfusion syndrome. Conjoined fetal twins.

289
00:12:46,473 --> 00:12:47,627
通过什么连接?
Connected by?

290
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:49,477
胎盘内的血管.
- Blood vessels in the placenta. - Meaning?

291
00:12:49,578 --> 00:12:50,636
意味着?

292
00:12:52,233 --> 00:12:55,853
一个胎儿得到的血太多了, 另一个太少了 两人都有生命危险.
One twin gets too much blood, the other too little, endangering both.

293
00:12:55,954 --> 00:12:57,129
我本以为你知道, Grey.
l'd expect you to know that, Grey.

294
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,388
你告诉我治愈的机会不多，但是...
You said probably nothing could be done.

295
00:12:59,489 --> 00:13:04,056
T.T.T.S.一般无法治愈, 除非你是世界上某些极少数的
TTTS is usually impossible to correct.

296
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,010
Unless you are one of a handful of surgeons in the world

297
00:13:04,157 --> 00:13:09,479
知道怎么分离胎儿血管的医生， 你很幸运, 我会.
who knows how to separate fetal blood vessels.

298
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,915
Which, luckily for you, l am.

299
00:13:09,797 --> 00:13:11,668
所有你明天就可以手术.
So we'll get you into surgery tomorrow.

300
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:14,941
如果你还有什么问题,就问Grey医生.
lf you have any questions at all, please ask Dr. Grey.

301
00:13:15,042 --> 00:13:20,312
在我看来, 她是本医院最受欢迎的实习医生.
From what l have seen, she is one of the hospital's most popular interns.

302
00:13:20,915 --> 00:13:23,161
如果你给我机会，我能回答你问我的问题
l could've answered your question given a chance.

303
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:24,101
闭嘴, Grey.
Chin up. l'm this tough on everyone, not just the women my husband sleeps with.

304
00:13:24,202 --> 00:13:27,013
我对谁都不好, 不仅仅是对和我丈夫上过床的女人.

305
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,715
预约B超...
Order an ultrasound for her and pre-op labs in...

306
00:13:31,148 --> 00:13:33,522
我能看看E19的病例吗?
Hi. Can l have the chart for E1 9, please? Thank you.

307
00:13:33,681 --> 00:13:34,640
谢谢.

308
00:13:41,969 --> 00:13:43,159
好的，你来了
Oh, good, you're here. Let's get started.

309
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,020
- 咱们开始吧. - 好吧.
OK.

310
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,273
- O'Malley?
- O'Malley. - Yeah?

311
00:13:50,374 --> 00:13:52,656
- 你碰我了. - 是的
- You're touching me. - Yeah.

312
00:13:52,757 --> 00:13:53,892
不要.
No. Carmen...

313
00:13:54,424 --> 00:13:55,510
Carmen...

314
00:13:59,773 --> 00:14:02,007
我想让你认真地听我说.
l want you to listen to me very carefully.

315
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:09,459
自从我来这里, 我不知道我的医生们 病人们、医院怎么了.
As long as l'm in here, l don't know what's happening out there.

316
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:08,975
With my doctors. My patients. My hospital.

317
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,642
你现在是我的耳目.
You are my eyes today. My ears.

318
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,863
我想让你当我的内探.
- l want you to be a sponge. - A sponge?

319
00:14:14,964 --> 00:14:15,789
内探?
You report any and everything happening in this hospital to me.

320
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:19,318
你向我报告这个医院里面发生的任何事情

321
00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:21,132
我是个调查内探.
- l'm an investigative sponge. - l'm not fooling around.

322
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:22,554
我不是瞎搅和的, O'Malley.
There's too much been happening lately under my radar.

323
00:14:22,655 --> 00:14:25,094
我感觉最近发生了不少事情.

324
00:14:26,456 --> 00:14:28,122
这样的情况不能再发生了.
lt stops today.

325
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:39,673
<i>[woman on PA]</i> <i>IV nurse, call ICU extension 323 1</i>.

326
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:43,408
<i>IV nurse, call ICU extension 323 1</i>.

327
00:14:45,466 --> 00:14:47,503
Burke, 你把Grey交给Addison了?
Burke. You gave Grey to Addison. Are you sure about that?

328
00:14:48,042 --> 00:14:49,154
你确定吗?
That's not your call, Shepherd. And for the record, l'm always sure.

329
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,553
那不是你能决定的, Shepherd.

330
00:14:50,654 --> 00:14:52,505
对于记录, 我总是很确信.

331
00:14:54,813 --> 00:14:55,812
你需要我做什么吗?
Did you need me? As the new chief, l'm...

332
00:14:55,913 --> 00:14:58,022
- 因为我是新主任, 我是... - 临时主任.
- lnterim chief. - ''Chief' nonetheless.

333
00:14:58,146 --> 00:14:59,299
尽管是主任.
Ever attempt a standstill surgery?

334
00:14:59,496 --> 00:15:01,208
试过静止手术吗?

335
00:15:02,306 --> 00:15:04,861
主要是因为动脉瘤的位置让手术变得很难.
[Derek] lt's the location of the aneurysm that makes it tricky.

336
00:15:04,962 --> 00:15:09,184
你的体温会降得很低来，你不会受损伤 但你的心跳会停止.
Your body temperature would be lowered to protect it and stop the heart.

337
00:15:09,285 --> 00:15:12,401
脑部血流停止, 降低动脉瘤破裂的危险.
Which stops blood flow to the brain which reduces the risk of rupture.

338
00:15:12,502 --> 00:15:14,530
我有45分钟来夹住动脉瘤
l'll have 45 minutes to clip the aneurysm.

339
00:15:14,631 --> 00:15:16,311
然后我再让心脏复跳.
- Before l get the heart started again. - You wanna freeze my body,

340
00:15:16,412 --> 00:15:20,308
你想冷冻我的身体，抽干我的血 停跳我的心脏？

341
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:20,781
- drain my blood, and stop my heart? - And bring you back.

342
00:15:20,409 --> 00:15:21,181
然后再让我复苏.
- ln under 45 minutes? - [Derek] Right.

343
00:15:21,282 --> 00:15:22,523
在45分钟以内.

344
00:15:23,201 --> 00:15:24,308
如果你超时了，能免费吗?
- lf you go over, is it free? - No.

345
00:15:24,409 --> 00:15:25,186
不能.
Dr. Yang, you can go and handle the pre-op labs now.

346
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:29,317
杨大夫,你可以去做术前检查了.

347
00:15:31,369 --> 00:15:32,254
多少钱?
How much? How much does something like this cost?

348
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,223
这种手术一般要花多少钱?
[Derek] Don't worry about that right now.

349
00:15:35,324 --> 00:15:36,915
我觉得你现在最好不要担心.

350
00:15:37,016 --> 00:15:40,987
你们说你能把我杀了然后救活我
Look, you guys say that you can kill me and bring me back, l believe you.

351
00:15:41,088 --> 00:15:42,495
我相信你，你们是医生
You're doctors, but l own a bar.

352
00:15:42,596 --> 00:15:43,813
但是我有一个酒吧.
l don't got any insurance so l'm not that concerned about the surgery

353
00:15:43,938 --> 00:15:47,083
我没有医疗保险, 所以我不是那么关心手术

354
00:15:47,184 --> 00:15:49,947
只要我能活着.
so much as what l'm gonna do when l survive it.

355
00:15:50,048 --> 00:15:51,127
你给我个数
l need a number. Ten grand? Twenty?

356
00:15:51,228 --> 00:15:53,752
1万? 2万?

357
00:15:56,026 --> 00:15:56,923
3万?
- Thirty? - lt's a couple hundred at least.

358
00:15:57,061 --> 00:15:58,447
至少要好几十万吧.
At least.

359
00:15:58,838 --> 00:15:59,859
至少.

360
00:16:04,544 --> 00:16:05,721
谁是Halloran?
[Alex] Who's Halloran?

361
00:16:06,374 --> 00:16:08,275
4115房间的病号.
Patient in 41 1 5.

362
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,897
- <i>[woman on PA] Dr. Cole, call the</i> O<i>R</i>. - Red hair?

363
00:16:09,365 --> 00:16:10,280
红头发?
Wife knits all the time? He had the colectomy?

364
00:16:10,381 --> 00:16:11,781
夫妻关系良好?

365
00:16:12,206 --> 00:16:13,260
他做了结肠切除术?
Ah, colon dude. That's right. Who's Monterroso?

366
00:16:13,361 --> 00:16:14,822
花花肠子，是的.

367
00:16:15,105 --> 00:16:16,135
谁是Monterosso?
4238. Mom with the really cute kids.

368
00:16:16,236 --> 00:16:18,908
4238. 有两个可爱孩子的妈妈.

369
00:16:19,027 --> 00:16:20,531
她昨晚体温骤升.
She spiked a post-op fever. You spent two hours with her.

370
00:16:20,632 --> 00:16:23,113
- 你花了两个小时观察她. - 疝气.
Hernia chick. That's right.

371
00:16:23,214 --> 00:16:25,186
你上周一直在治这些人.
You've treated them for a week and you don't know their names?

372
00:16:25,287 --> 00:16:26,514
你怎么都知道他们的名字?
ln Surgery we don't waste time getting to know the patients.

373
00:16:26,615 --> 00:16:29,980
外科是唯一一个不用浪费时间了解病人的专业.

374
00:16:30,081 --> 00:16:32,095
- 他们是一大块肉, 我们是屠夫. - 他们是人.
- They're meat, we're butchers. - They're humans.

375
00:16:32,196 --> 00:16:33,461
你知道人是什么,
You do know what a human is, Evil Spawn?

376
00:16:33,562 --> 00:16:35,287
- 不是吗, 恶魔之子? - 我不是魔鬼.
l'm not evil. Unless evil turns you on.

377
00:16:35,388 --> 00:16:36,784
除非魔鬼把你开启了.

378
00:16:38,424 --> 00:16:43,197
你有没有早晨醒来，感觉到没有人喜欢你 我不知道你关不关心这个
Do you ever wake up, realize nobody likes you, and, l don't know, care?

379
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:46,464
Oh. [chuckles] l think somebody likes me.

380
00:16:45,157 --> 00:16:46,744
我想有人喜欢我.

381
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,210
[Yang] Hey.

382
00:16:54,996 --> 00:16:57,503
你当了主任就不说话了,嗨,Burke!
What, you don't speak now you're chief? Burke!

383
00:16:57,754 --> 00:16:58,800
你想要什么?
- What do you want? - What?

384
00:16:59,834 --> 00:17:00,556
什么?
What do you want? You don't want to go out to dinner.

385
00:17:00,657 --> 00:17:01,623
你想要什么?

386
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:02,948
你不想出去吃饭.
You don't want to meet me in the on-call room, and you don't want to talk to me.

387
00:17:03,049 --> 00:17:06,374
你不想在值班室见我， 肯定是你不想和我说话

388
00:17:06,787 --> 00:17:10,162
我可以装着我知道,但是, 我连你家电话号码都没有.
l could pretend l know, but l don't have your home phone number.

389
00:17:10,289 --> 00:17:12,072
告诉我，你到底想要什么?!
- So tell me, what do you want? - Don't yell at me.

390
00:17:12,557 --> 00:17:13,856
别对我吼.

391
00:17:15,477 --> 00:17:17,373
- 我们在这里说话的. - 你想干吗?
- We're having a conversation. - What do you want?

392
00:17:17,474 --> 00:17:18,725
我不知道！
l don't know!

393
00:17:25,774 --> 00:17:26,881
自己想想.
Figure it out.

394
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,035
今天有什么报告?
What's the report?

395
00:17:48,552 --> 00:17:49,694
没有报告.
No report. lt's very quiet today, sir.

396
00:17:49,795 --> 00:17:51,619
今天没有什么事情发生.
There's no gossip? Surgeries l should know about?

397
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,326
没有新闻, 闲话,手术吗？我都想知道?

398
00:17:54,427 --> 00:17:55,721
得了,嚷嚷什么,O'Malley?
- Now come on, what's the buzz? - You know, not in halls, not in OR.

399
00:17:55,822 --> 00:17:59,875
大厅里没事，手术室里没事, 楼梯间也没事.

400
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:59,706
Not in the stairwells.

401
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,538
特别是，你知道。没有事情发生在...
Especially nothing happening in the, you know... They're just stairwells.

402
00:18:04,475 --> 00:18:05,741
只是楼梯间而已.

403
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:12,586
[Alex wolf whistles]

404
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,215
他们说你穿着女睡衣, 但是我想自己来看看.
They told me you were in a nightgown, but l thought l'd come see.

405
00:18:16,316 --> 00:18:17,550
不错.
Very nice, huh.

406
00:18:17,651 --> 00:18:20,138
听说O'Malley扁了你.漂亮的眼睛.
Heard O'Malley laid you out cold. Nice eye.

407
00:18:21,281 --> 00:18:22,481
谁送来的?
- Whoa, who sent that? - We all pitched in. The whole floor.

408
00:18:22,582 --> 00:18:23,559
我们都在内.
Well, please, tell the whole floor a big thank you.

409
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,455
整层楼的人.

410
00:18:24,556 --> 00:18:27,627
谢谢整层楼的人

411
00:18:27,728 --> 00:18:28,801
好的我会的.
Yeah, l will.

412
00:18:29,193 --> 00:18:31,565
Alex,你一定要把我弄出去.
Alex, you gotta get me out of here, man. Get me transferred to County Hospital.

413
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,495
把我转到县医院或者别的医院.
Not County. Here, they can kill you and bring you back,

414
00:18:33,596 --> 00:18:34,886
你可别去县里.

415
00:18:34,987 --> 00:18:36,532
我的意思是说 这里他们知道怎么让你心跳停止然后复苏
but at County, they can just kill you. No joke.

416
00:18:36,633 --> 00:18:38,958
但是县医院只知道怎么让你心跳停止 不是开玩笑

417
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:40,584
我花不起钱啊.
l can't afford this place, man. l'm gonna lose the bar.

418
00:18:40,685 --> 00:18:41,848
我会失去酒吧的.
- Hey, Joe, how you doing? - Hey, Scooter.

419
00:18:41,949 --> 00:18:42,833
Joe, 你好吗?

420
00:18:42,934 --> 00:18:44,314
Scooter.

421
00:18:45,797 --> 00:18:47,779
好了.那是我的.
OK. That's mine?

422
00:18:47,911 --> 00:18:48,865
重要的事情先来.
- We'll start by saving your life. - The bar is my life. You know that.

423
00:18:48,966 --> 00:18:50,598
我们要从救命开始.

424
00:18:50,699 --> 00:18:51,660
这个酒吧是我的命啊.
You've been at last call every night since you moved here.

425
00:18:51,761 --> 00:18:55,063
你知道的.至少你可以让我随叫随到 ，你搬到这里的每天晚上都可以.

426
00:18:55,641 --> 00:18:58,558
我现在要把它关掉或者卖掉.
l'm gonna have to shut it down or sell it.

427
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:00,073
你不能这样做.
You can't do that. Place is an institution.

428
00:19:00,174 --> 00:19:01,503
那个地方是公共机构.
l've owned the bar across the street for 1 4 years,

429
00:19:01,604 --> 00:19:03,868
我拥有街对面的酒吧14年了,

430
00:19:03,969 --> 00:19:06,246
到现在我还没有来过一次医院
and l've never been inside this hospital till now.

431
00:19:06,347 --> 00:19:07,570
我现在把我的钱付了?
l'll pay my tab. That's gotta be good for something. How much is it?

432
00:19:07,671 --> 00:19:08,603
这样还不错

433
00:19:08,704 --> 00:19:09,570
多少钱?
Close to a grand.

434
00:19:09,671 --> 00:19:11,197
快一千了.

435
00:19:13,468 --> 00:19:16,261
你看60块怎么样...
How about l pay, like, 60?

436

这不错了.
That's good. And l'll pay you back later.

437
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:19,787
剩下的以后再还你.

偷别人的丈夫会怎么样?
What does it take to go after another woman's husband?

441
00:19:34,182 --> 00:19:34,991
什么意思?
- Excuse me? - lt happened to me.

442
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:36,120
我在说我.
Jeff moved in with a long-legged miniskirt who answers his phones

443
00:19:36,417 --> 00:19:40,820
Jeff和一个长腿的穿超短裙的女人同居了 我怀孕3周了都是她替我丈夫接的电话

444
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:41,977

很抱歉，我是说关于你的丈夫.

447
00:19:45,739 --> 00:19:48,371
你对Montgomery Shepherd医生的丈夫抱歉吗?
Are you sorry about Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd's husband?

448
00:19:50,518 --> 00:19:52,905
我今天要给你做一些检查.

00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:19,683
Move.

553
00:25:21,682 --> 00:25:23,101
让Pete每天晚上冲洗水管
[Joe] Tell Pete to wash out the taps every night. Not every other night.

554
00:25:23,202 --> 00:25:24,975
不是隔一天一次,是一天一次.
And remind him that the delivery truck comes at 6:00a.m. Kegs go in the back.

555
00:25:25,263 --> 00:25:29,198
提醒他送货车每天早晨6点到,小桶在后面.

556
00:25:29,631 --> 00:25:30,606
还有一件事,
Oh, another thing. There's petty cash on the top shelf in the storage closet.

557
00:25:30,707 --> 00:25:34,324
零钱在储藏柜最上面的架子上

558
00:25:36,747 --> 00:25:38,459
我们只给病人做手术.
We're operating on patients. That's it.

559
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,243
- 我知道,但是... - 我很同情.真的
- l know, but... - l sympathize. l do.

560
00:25:40,344 --> 00:25:42,424
但是解决Joe的经济问题不是我管的
But solving Joe's finances is not my job, it's not your job,

561
00:25:42,525 --> 00:25:46,418
这也不是你的事情 我也确定这不是我今天给你分配的任务.
and it's sure as hell not the job l assigned you today.

562
00:25:47,229 --> 00:25:50,672
把他切开、缝起来就不管了是不对的 他什么都没有剩下了.
lt seems wrong to cut him open, sew him up, and leave him, left with nothing.

563
00:25:50,773 --> 00:25:53,523
如果我们能救他的命, 我们不可能让他一无所有
lf we can save his life, we'll hardly be leaving him with nothing.

564
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,049
<i>[steady beeping]</i>

565
00:26:01,537 --> 00:26:03,235
这是所有我能做的.
That's as far as l can go for now. Let's start cooling him.

566
00:26:03,607 --> 00:26:04,700
开始给他降温.

567
00:26:21,865 --> 00:26:23,749
从后面看不到什么东西的, O'Malley.
Can't see much from back here, O'Malley.

568
00:26:23,938 --> 00:26:26,447
我知道.我正在找一个能帮助Joe的缺口.
l know. l'm trying to find a loophole to help Joe.

569
00:26:28,298 --> 00:26:29,195
你认识Joe吗?
- [George] You know Joe? - Oh, yeah.

570
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:33,286
那年我是这里唯一的一个女实习生
l was the only female intern my year.

571
00:26:33,731 --> 00:26:36,408
我谁都不认识, 除了Joe也没有人认识我.
l didn't know anybody and nobody knew me except Joe.

572
00:26:36,925 --> 00:26:38,049
他了解我.
He knew me.

573
00:26:39,417 --> 00:26:42,073
你和Joe...
Oh. So, you and Joe?

574
00:26:42,829 --> 00:26:45,643
你这种人想的事情就是怎样和人上床.
All you people ever think about is how to get into somebody's pants.

575
00:26:45,744 --> 00:26:46,827
你真恶心.
You're nasty. That's why you got syphilis.

576
00:26:46,928 --> 00:26:48,465
所以你得了梅毒.
Joe was the first person here to say l'd make a good surgeon.

577
00:26:48,658 --> 00:26:53,290
Joe是这里第一个告诉我我可以当个好的外科大夫的人 不是你想的那些东西

578
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:56,370
Not that he knew anything about it. But it was somethin' when l had nothin'.

579
00:26:53,801 --> 00:26:56,226
但是这对什么都没有的我来说可是一件大事.

580
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,705
是的,我是铁石心肠的人, 你带来了点心.
Oh, sure. l'm the guy with the heart of stone and you brought snacks.

581
00:27:02,827 --> 00:27:03,896
这个是工作餐.
- lt's a working lunch. - Snacks to watch Joe die.

582
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,153
吃着点心看着Joe死.
He's not gonna ''die'' die. They'll bring him back.

583
00:27:05,254 --> 00:27:07,140
他不会死翘翘的.他们能给他弄回来.

584
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,706
他要体验一次死,没有脉搏.
He is going to ''die'' die. No ''pulse'' pulse. He'll be ''dead'' dead.

585
00:27:09,807 --> 00:27:11,008
他会死翘翘的.
lt's a granola bar, Alex.

586
00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:15,800
这是格兰诺拉麦片饼干，不是一包 看电影时吃的巧克力薄荷糖和爆米花
Not a bag of supersize popcorn and a box of chocolate movie mints.

587
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:16,752
对了.
That's it.

588
00:27:18,974 --> 00:27:19,865
死了.
Dead!

589
00:27:21,449 --> 00:27:22,708
不好意思.
Excuse me.

590
00:27:24,436 --> 00:27:26,825
Julie我们要给你做宫腔镜.
[Addison] Julie, we're gonna go in laparoscopically.

591
00:27:26,976 --> 00:27:28,579
你不会有感觉的.
You're not gonna feel anything. And neither are the twins.

592
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:30,105
你的双胞胎也不会.
OK, let's get going!

593
00:27:30,296 --> 00:27:31,649
咱们开始吧.

594
00:27:32,924 --> 00:27:33,931
薄刀片.
Ten blade. Begin with a three-millimeter incision.

595
00:27:35,117 --> 00:27:37,419
从三毫米的切口开始.

596
00:27:46,257 --> 00:27:47,400
阻断血流?
- [Burke] We stop the blood flow? - To protect the brain.

597
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:51,716
为了保护大脑, 在没有血流的空间做手术 动脉瘤不会破裂
Operate in a bloodless field so the aneurysm won't rupture.

598
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:52,985
身体降温呢?
- [Burke] And cool the body? - To induce hypothermia.

599
00:27:53,086 --> 00:27:54,364
降低体温.
Keeps the tissue viable until the blood is restored.

600
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:57,195
血液重新灌流之前保持组织活性

601
00:27:58,089 --> 00:27:59,873
体温60华氏
Body temp is at 60 degrees.

602
00:28:00,635 --> 00:28:02,665
好了, Joe.死的时间到了.
OK, Joe. Time to die.

603
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:10,143
[whirring]

604
00:28:19,046 --> 00:28:20,063
血流平稳.
- <i>[continuous beep]</i> - Flatline.

605
00:28:21,398 --> 00:28:22,028
好的.
- We've got 45 minutes, people. - Start the clock.

606
00:28:22,129 --> 00:28:24,349
- 我们只有45分钟了. - 开始计时.

607
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,059
Got it.

608
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:37,245
[chatter]

609
00:28:39,013 --> 00:28:40,580
你和Joe有什么故事?
[Derek] So what's your ''Joe'' story? Seems like everybody here has one.

610
00:28:40,696 --> 00:28:42,552
看来这里每个人都有一个.

611
00:28:43,415 --> 00:28:44,287
你先来.
You first.

612
00:28:44,418 --> 00:28:48,192
我来这里工作前先去找Joe了
OK. l went to Joe's place the night before l started working here.

613
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,562
我只在市中心呆了几天.
l'd only been in town, you know, a few days.

614
00:28:50,734 --> 00:28:53,731
我认识了这个女人.我喝醉了 她趁人之危
l met a woman. l got drunk and she took advantage of me.

615
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:55,671
或者是她喝醉了,我趁她之危.
Or she got drunk and l took advantage of her.

616
00:28:55,772 --> 00:28:57,205
我喝醉了她没有喝酒.
l got drunk and she took... No. We were drunk. Definitely.

617
00:28:57,306 --> 00:28:58,677
我们一定都醉了.
Somebody took advantage. Either way, l look at it as my initiation to Seattle.

618
00:28:58,968 --> 00:28:59,929
有人趁人之危了

619
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:03,217
不管怎么样 我希望把这事看作我在西雅图的开始.

620
00:29:03,318 --> 00:29:04,206
你呢?
- What about you? - Oh, l don't have one.

621
00:29:04,497 --> 00:29:05,970
我没有.
l just wanted to hear yours.

622
00:29:06,366 --> 00:29:07,838
我只想听听你的.

623
00:29:15,674 --> 00:29:18,108
原则上说书面材料要
[George] So, technically, the paperwork just needs to be submitted

624
00:29:18,209 --> 00:29:20,838
在手术开始那天中午以前上交?
by midnight of the day of the surgery to be considered?

625
00:29:21,701 --> 00:29:22,592
好的.
Oh, good. Well, thank you very much. Thanks.

626
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:23,951
太谢谢你了.

627
00:29:24,382 --> 00:29:25,198
谢谢.

628
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:29,691
你那里怎么样, Grey?
How you doing there, Grey?

629
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:31,401
很好.
Good. l'm good.

630
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:33,009
我很好.

631
00:29:39,501 --> 00:29:42,382
- 你要是了解我了我还是很不错的. - 你不是.
You know, l'm very sweet once you get to know me.

632
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:43,341
- No, you're not. - We could be good friends.

633
00:29:42,742 --> 00:29:45,391
- 我们可以做好朋友. - Alex, 永远不可能.
- Alex. Never, ever. Ever. - Why not?

634
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:47,709
- 永远. - 为什么?
Give me one reason why we could? What about you is even remotely human?

635
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,726
你给我一个可以的理由.

636
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:51,915
你为什总是那么难接近?

637
00:29:53,557 --> 00:29:54,893
太慢了.
lt's going too slowly.

638
00:29:55,518 --> 00:29:56,986
我希望Joe能挺过去.
- l hope Joe can pull through this. - He can. He will. He has to.

639
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:58,559
他能的.

640
00:29:58,869 --> 00:29:59,922
他不得不.

641
00:30:00,831 --> 00:30:01,993
天哪.
<i>[Derek] Damn it</i>. <i>I can't get the clamp to hold</i>.

642
00:30:02,785 --> 00:30:04,383
我用这个钳子夹不住.
Give me the bipolars. l'm gonna go in at a different angle.

643
00:30:04,863 --> 00:30:07,432
给我--好的, 我们要换一个角度.

644
00:30:09,126 --> 00:30:09,989
还剩多少时间?
Time remaining?

645
00:30:10,828 --> 00:30:12,821
- 重新灌流,快. - 17分钟.
- [Derek] lrrigation, please. - 1 7 minutes.

646
00:30:13,131 --> 00:30:15,952
Shepherd,我需要8分钟让他复苏
Shepherd, l need eight minutes to get him back, to warm him up.

647
00:30:16,821 --> 00:30:18,725
计时下一个17分钟.
Time to make the next 1 7 minutes count.

648
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:21,505
- 从这里进. - 你看到了?
[Derek] Right there, go in from there. See it?

649
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:23,551
See, that's why we can't do it right there.

650
00:30:26,427 --> 00:30:31,514
他死了，原则上说，这是科学，这是件大事
[George] He's dead. Technically.

651
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,992
Which is science, and this is a huge thing.

652
00:30:31,615 --> 00:30:34,677
所以我认为有的科研基金应该对这个有兴趣.
So some research foundation has to be interested.

653
00:30:34,778 --> 00:30:37,422
你的意思是说你想捐Joe的身体给科学研究
So, in essence, you want to donate Joe's body to science?

654
00:30:38,434 --> 00:30:40,120
至少剩下 17 分钟是
At least for the next 1 7 minutes.

655
00:30:40,221 --> 00:30:43,050
- 一个私人捐助的基金. - 教育目的.
- ''Privately funded grant.'' - For educational purposes.

656
00:30:43,151 --> 00:30:44,241
这是教学医院.
We're a teaching hospital. The standstill surgery qualifies.

657
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,205
有资格做静止手术.
l didn't peg you for the type to ignore my instructions.

658
00:30:46,366 --> 00:30:49,280
你不要无视我的指挥O'Malley.

659
00:30:49,381 --> 00:30:51,258
我很尊重的对您说，这个值得去做.
All due respect, sir, it's worth a shot. lt's someone's life.

660
00:30:51,626 --> 00:30:52,535
这是某人的生命.
lt's always someone's life, O'Malley.

661
00:30:52,636 --> 00:30:54,352
总是关于某人的生命, O'Malley.

662
00:31:02,317 --> 00:31:03,296
你迷茫了.
You're hovering.

663
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,930
你可以走了.
- You can leave now. - OK.

664
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,368
[grumbles]

665
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,594
8分钟.
[nurse] Eight minutes.

666
00:31:15,051 --> 00:31:16,664
我们现在开始复温, Shepherd.
We need to start rewarming, Shepherd.

667
00:31:17,066 --> 00:31:18,472
拿着两极，谢谢
Take the bipolars, please. Thank you.

668
00:31:18,573 --> 00:31:21,972
- Shepherd, 我们现在开始复温 - 拿好.
Shepherd, we need to start warming him up, now!

669
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:24,883
- 现在, 我现在就要接手他, Shepherd. - 我够不着.
- Hang on. - Now. l need it now, Shepherd.

670
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:27,073
l can't seem to get... l just can't get behind the aneurysm.

671
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:30,143
lf l could get behind the aneurysm, l could... There it is.

672
00:31:29,438 --> 00:31:30,490
就这样了.

673
00:31:32,089 --> 00:31:32,898
好了.
Got it. That's it.

674
00:31:33,781 --> 00:31:34,631
就这样.
- Are you sure? - l'm always sure.

675
00:31:34,761 --> 00:31:35,626
你确定?

676
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,809
我总是肯定.
[Derek] Good work, everybody. lt's all yours there, Chief.

677
00:31:37,453 --> 00:31:38,679
好了，大家干得不错.

678
00:31:39,056 --> 00:31:40,529
全是你的功劳，主刀.

679
00:31:41,606 --> 00:31:44,455
好的，伙计们，咱们在Joe见上帝前抓住他
OK, let's grab Joe before he decides to go into the light.

680
00:31:44,556 --> 00:31:45,748
开始给他复温.
Start warming him up.

681
00:31:46,734 --> 00:31:48,320
松掉钳子.
Clamps are coming off.

682
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:50,447
打开泵.
Turn the pump on.

683
00:31:54,201 --> 00:31:56,610
观察脑灌注压.
Watch cerebral perfusion pressures.

684
00:31:56,663 --> 00:31:58,569
Keep M.A.P. Greater than 60, please.
Keep M.A.P. at greater than 60, please.

685
00:32:06,568 --> 00:32:08,065
I know you're enjoying yourself, Preston.
[Richard] l know you're enjoying yourself, Preston.

686
00:32:08,292 --> 00:32:09,787
It's a power kick to be the chief.
lt's a power kick to be the chief.

687
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:13,203
You're never more surrounded, never more alone.

Oh, you're ending this?

721
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,030
我觉得最好结束的彻底一点.
l think it's best to make a clean break.

722
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:04,344
好吧.
OK.

Before it gets too involved. Before it gets...

Messy. Right, right. That would be bad.

725
00:34:09,106 --> 00:34:10,511
那样会很糟糕

726

这不是针对你的.
lt's nothing personal.

进来, O'Malley.
Get in here, O'Malley.

728

我尽力了，我真的尽力了.
OK. l tried. l really tried.

729

但是最近这里有很多事情发生,
But there's a lot of stuff happening out there. Stuff l can't tell you.

我不能告诉你，不会告诉你.
Stuff l won't tell you.

都是不能想像的事情
Crazy stuff.

732
00:35:14,448 --> 00:35:16,176
我想起来就做噩梦的事情.
Stuff l'm gonna have nightmares about.

733
00:35:18,028 --> 00:35:21,727
但是我不准备告诉你任何一件事情 因为都是无关紧要的.
But l'm not gonna tell you about any of it.

734
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,581
Because it doesn't matter.

735
00:35:22,322 --> 00:35:24,414
和我们都认识的喜欢的那个人无关
Not when there's a guy who we all know and love

736
00:35:24,515 --> 00:35:27,952
他会因为要做手术而破产.

737
00:35:28,077 --> 00:35:29,887
- 我整天都在干这个. - O'Malley!
- l spent the whole day on it. - O'Malley...

738
00:35:29,988 --> 00:35:31,185

Let me finish.

739
00:35:33,626 --> 00:35:34,755
你错了,先生.
You're wrong, sir.

740
00:35:35,472 --> 00:35:39,382
现在你可以解雇我 或者让我老老实实地遵守规矩，怎么样都可以
Now you can fire me, or bring me up on disciplinary action or whatever.

741
00:35:39,779 --> 00:35:43,317
-但是我告诉你, Joe应该得到我们的... - 应该得到我们的帮助.
l'm telling you, Joe deserves...

742
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:45,575
Deserves our help. Couldn't help yourself, could you?

743
00:35:44,651 --> 00:35:46,079
你控制不住，对吗?
Whether or not it'd win you any points, even from me.

744
00:35:46,197 --> 00:35:49,771
不管你甚至是我要为此付出多少.

745
00:35:50,694 --> 00:35:52,283
我签了你的申请.
l signed your request.

746
00:35:52,596 --> 00:35:54,705
把它给Patricia. 她知道该怎么办.
Give it to Patricia, she'll know what to do.

747
00:35:54,925 --> 00:35:57,686
- 看来Joe终于能保住他的酒吧了. - 谢谢你
- Joe may keep his bar after all. - Thank you, sir.

748
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,234
- O'Malley. - 在.
- O'Malley! - Yes?

749
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:03,149
再这样朝我吼 我就把你整得像小树枝一样顺从.
Yell at me again, and l'll snap you like a twig.

750
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,174
遵命.
Yes, sir.

751
00:36:08,247 --> 00:36:10,471
看到了？就是一个小伤疤.
See? Just a small scar.

752
00:36:11,151 --> 00:36:12,734
我的孩子呢?
And my babies?

753
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,028
<i>[PA] Dr. Cole, call the</i> O<i>R</i>.

754
00:36:14,457 --> 00:36:16,334
你的孩子们很好.
Your babies are doing very well.

755
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:22,830
Grey医生一会就会回来给你检查.
And Dr. Grey will be back to check on you a little bit later.

756
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:25,382
事实上,我更希望Grey医生可以不再参与.
l'd prefer it if Dr. Grey were taken off the case.

757
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,364
为什么?有问题吗？
Why, is there a problem?

758
00:36:27,465 --> 00:36:29,523
我想起了一些我不喜欢的人
Just reminds me of someone l don't like. Someone my husband likes a lot.

759
00:36:29,643 --> 00:36:32,987
我丈夫喜欢的人, 特别是穿紧身内衣的.
Particularly in lingerie. You understand.

760
00:36:33,364 --> 00:36:34,556
你知道.
No, no, l don't understand.

761
00:36:34,657 --> 00:36:37,303
不，我不明白.

762
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:39,472
她不是和你的老公上床了吗?
Well, she's sleeping with your husband, right?

763
00:36:41,994 --> 00:36:43,259
Phillips太太...
Ms. Philips, l lack Dr. Grey's class and patience

764
00:36:44,019 --> 00:36:49,527
我喜欢Grey医生的层次和耐心 让我把这事情说清楚

765
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:48,838
so, let me set the record straight.

766
00:36:49,697 --> 00:36:51,839
我老公没有背叛我，我背叛了他.
My husband didn't cheat on me, l cheated on him.

767
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,452
所以被误解的女人是
So the wronged woman here, Dr. Grey.

768
00:36:53,553 --> 00:36:54,612
Grey医生.
So, l think you owe her one hell of an apology.

769
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:58,675
所以我认为你该给她道歉.

770
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:15,866
一天晚上我停了车，进了家门 有些东西不对劲.
One night l parked my car,

771
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:15,231
l unlock my front door, go inside my house, and something's different.

772
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:20,743
没有什么不对劲, 什么都没有变 但是还是...
Nothing's different, everything's the same

773
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:23,406
but yet, still, something's different.

774
00:37:22,244 --> 00:37:23,620
不太对劲.

775
00:37:25,734 --> 00:37:27,269
我在那里站了一会...
And l stand there for a while.

776
00:37:31,122 --> 00:37:32,229
然后我知道.
And then l know.

777
00:37:34,884 --> 00:37:39,565
有时候，我知道有事情要发生 在手术室也是
See, there are moments for me, you know, usually when l'm in the OR,

778
00:37:40,979 --> 00:37:43,383
我能预感到下面要发生什么.
when l just know what's gonna happen next.

779
00:37:50,809 --> 00:37:52,369
所以我上楼了.
So l go upstairs.

780
00:37:52,544 --> 00:37:57,165
我正在大厅里, 做好心理准备.
As l walk down the hall, l try to prepare myself for what l'm gonna see

781
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:56,897
when l go into my bedroom.

782
00:37:57,336 --> 00:37:59,852
我踩到了一个男人的夹克上，那夹克不是我的.
l step on a man's jacket that doesn't belong to me.

783
00:38:01,933 --> 00:38:03,495
我想我全都知道了...
And everything l think l know... just shifts.

784
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:06,742
只是代替

785
00:38:08,662 --> 00:38:11,713
因为虽然不是我的夹克 但是我能认出来.
Because the jacket that doesn't belong to me is a jacket that l recognize.

786
00:38:13,236 --> 00:38:18,986
我知道如果我走进卧室 不仅仅会看到我的妻子不忠.
And what l know now is that when l go into my bedroom,

787
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:18,490
l'm not just gonna see that my wife is cheating on me.

788
00:38:19,189 --> 00:38:23,770
会看到我的妻子在背叛我, 和Mark一起 而Mark恰恰是我最好的朋友.
l'm gonna see that my wife is cheating on me with Mark,

789
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:23,729
who happened to be my best friend.

790
00:38:27,715 --> 00:38:32,681
多么俗套肮脏残酷的故事.
lt's just so pedestrian, common and dirty,

791
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:32,966
and cruel.

792
00:38:34,974 --> 00:38:36,572
大部分是残酷.
Mostly just cruel.

793
00:38:39,107 --> 00:38:40,692
我出来了. 我来到这里.
l left. Came out here.

794
00:38:42,727 --> 00:38:45,085
-你见到了我 -我见到了你
- And you met me. - And l met you.

795
00:38:55,036 --> 00:38:56,872
那我对于你来说算什么?
Well, what was l to you?

796
00:38:57,993 --> 00:39:00,514
你为了熬过痛苦期而搞的女孩?
The girl you screwed to get over being screwed?

797
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,859
你像吹来的清风.
You were like coming up for fresh air.

798
00:39:07,062 --> 00:39:09,105
好像我在堕落，你拯救了我.
lt's like l was drowning and you saved me.

799
00:39:12,908 --> 00:39:13,942
这都是我想说的.
That's all l know.

800
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,887
还不够
lt's not enough.
