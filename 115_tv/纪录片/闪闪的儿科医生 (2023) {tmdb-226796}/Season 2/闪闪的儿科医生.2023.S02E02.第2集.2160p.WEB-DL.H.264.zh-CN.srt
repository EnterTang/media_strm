00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,570
很晚了

闭上眼睛睡觉

你想干吗 clance?
What do you want,clance?

10
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,430
Oh 爸爸
Oh. Hi,dad.

11
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,310
睡觉去
Go to bed.

12
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,740
我能开着电视睡吗?
Can I turn the tv on?

13
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,030
电视只能白天看
Tv is only for the daytime.

14
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,960
我会把音量调小的 我想屋子里有光
I'll keep the volume down. I just like the light.

15
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,460
睡觉
Go to bed.

16
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,550
爸爸 如果...
Dad,what if...

17
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,470
如果他们又来抓我怎么办?
what if they cometo get me again?

18
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,430
没有人要抓你
Nobody is comingto get you.

19
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,650
好好睡觉 快点
Go to bed. Now.

20
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,670
妈妈!
Mom!

21
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,440
妈妈!
Mom!

22
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,370
妈妈!
Mom!

23
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,290
快点 clance 起床了
Come on,bud. It's time to get up--

24
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,180
哈 我想他已经起来了
I guess he's already up.

25
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,840
这可是头一次
That's a first.

26
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,510
我 呃 我去问他想吃什么
I-I will,uh,I'll seeif he needs breakfast.

27
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,840
嘿 clance 饿不饿?
Hey,clance,you hungry?

28
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,770
亲爱的 他不在楼下啊
Hon,he's not down here.

29
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,910
是吗?
You sure?

30
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,210
Clancy?
Clancy?

31
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,680
Clancy?
Clancy?

32
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,540
Clancy?
Clancy?

33
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,440
你在哪里?
Where are you?

34
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,230
亲爱的 你躲在哪儿了?
Sweetie,are you hiding?

35
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,490
- Clancy? - 他去哪了?
- Clancy? - Where is he?

36
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,900
Clancy!
Clancy!

37
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,490
Clancy?
Clancy?

38
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,750
等我找到你 有你好看
You're gonna bein big trouble when i find you.

39
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,160
亲爱的 不管你躲哪了 快点出来 这可不是好玩的
honey,come out right now,wherever you are. This is not funny.

40
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,790
Clancy!
Clancy!

41
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,680
Clancy?
Clancy?

42
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:14,490
<font color="#ffff00">-=豪斯医生=- S03E02 "Cane & Able"</font>
<font color="#ffff00">House Season 03 Episode 02</font>

43
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,700
啊 满身臭汗不见了?
Where's the sweat and the B.O.?

44
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,430
你曾经那么喜欢 让我们沉浸在你的汗臭中
You've taken such pride in bathing us all in your musk.

45
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,520
在家冲凉了
Showered at home.

46
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,500
你还比平时早
And yet you're earlier than usual.

47
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,820
这算是心理治疗么?
Is this an intervention?

48
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,380
现在已经晚了 因为我已经戒了
It's a little late, since I'm not using drugs anymore.

49
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,540
但是我对字母的瘾还没有戒
I am,however,still hooked on phonics.

50
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,810
如果你真的晨跑了 还在家冲凉的话 应该会比平时晚的
If you did your morning run and showered at home, you'd be later than usual.

51
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,480
我冲凉的时候想你了
Thought of you in the shower.

52
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,940
你腿怎么样了?
How's your leg?

53
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,700
你好像喜欢用左腿
You seem to be favoring your left side.

54
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,330
我昨天把右边裤脚放长了 就这点区别
I was hanging down my right pant leg yesterday. Makes all the difference in the world.

55
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:18,270
- 你每天都爬楼梯 - 是不是要有法庭令你们才不烦我?
- You've taken the stairs every day. - Did I need a restraining order?

56
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:21,260
康复过程中不锻炼的话 肌肉会萎缩
You slack on your rehab, the muscle will weaken.

57
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,080
你的腿又会疼
And your leg will hurt again.

58
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,100
看来k他命的治疗好像效果不佳
Looks like the ketamine treatment might not stick.

59
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,610
也许是我们让他情绪低落 因为我们对他说谎了
Or maybe we've made him depressed because we're lying to him.

60
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,110
说他的病例诊断错了
Telling him he got that case wrong.

61
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,350
我们没有伤害他 疼痛不是...
We didn't hurt him. The pain isn'T...

62
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,420
他变消极了 不做运动了
he gets depressed,he stops exercising.

63
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,650
他不运动的话 肌肉会萎缩
He stops exercising,the muscle atrophies.

64
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,390
肌肉一萎缩 疼痛就开始了
The muscle atrophies,the pain returns.

65
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:45,760
也许他停止运动是因为 他腿上的伤口真的很痛
Maybe he stopped exercising because the giant hole in his leg actually hurts.

66
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:51,260
k他命的治疗没问题 现在他又要大吞止疼药了
The ketamine could work perfectly and he would still be back on his cane popping vicon again.

67
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,810
不能告诉他
You can't tell him.

68
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,750
纯属运气 没有医学根据...
He got lucky. There was no medical...

69
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,290
他是对的
he was right.

70
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:00,240
告诉他他是对的 等于纵容他的毛病
We tell him he was right,and we're feeding his addiction.

71
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,690
没有了止疼药 他只剩下一项嗜好
Without vicodin,he's only got one to focus on.

72
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,740
猜病人的病症总好过服药过量
Well,he's not gonna O.D.On puzzles.

73
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,050
他自己的确没事
No,it's not gonna hurt him.

74
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,990
他可能会害死病人
But he could just as easily have killed that patient.

75
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,450
我们有一个微小的机会 让House回归理性
We have a tiny window of time here where house may be healthy enough to change.

76
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:19,910
从刚才他跛行的样子来看 这个机会正在逝去
And based on that limp,the window's closing fast.

77
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:28,400
小孩是试管婴儿 接种过疫苗
Kid is a product of an in vitro fertilization pregnancy.Had all his vaccinations.

78
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,270
3岁时右手尺骨骨折 5岁出水痘
Fractured his right ulna at age three, chicken pox at age fivE...

79
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,270
感情上有没有创伤?
did he ever get his feelings hurt?

80
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,610
这我也要知道
I'll need to know that too.

81
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:41,370
你回来以后还一分未得 我们至少想确认...
You are 0 for 1 since you came back. We just wanna make sure...

82
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,860
直肠出血还有外星人绑架的幻觉 很可能是性虐待症状
rectal bleeding plus alien abduction fantasies, most likely sexual abuse.

83
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,340
插入导致流血 精神创伤导致幻想
Penetration causes the bleed, trauma causes the fantasy.

84
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,930
急诊做过检查 未发现撕裂 精液和阴毛
E.R. Ran a rape kit,found no evidence of tearing,semen,or pubic hairs.

85
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,070
应该和孩子谈谈
I think we should talk to the kid.

86
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,410
为什么?
Why?

87
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,290
难道他说的会是真话?
In case he's telling the truth?

88
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,090
你信这些的 对不对?
You're a believer,aren't you?

89
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:03,160
我只是没那么自大 毕竟有500亿个星系
I'm just not arrogant enough to think that of the 50 billion galaxies,

90
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:07,580
每个星系有1000亿个恒星 宇宙间有几亿亿个行星
100 billion stars per galaxy and ten million billion planets in the universe,

91
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,340
我们不会是唯一的生命
that we're the only ones with life.

92
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,310
不会
No.

93
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:13,220
不过我们是唯一一种 喜欢往后庭里插东西的生物
But I'm guessing we're the only ones who like shoving things through our backdoors.

94
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:17,140
研究表明神经问题和出血紊乱有关联
There is new research indicating a link between neurological problems and bleeding disorders.

95
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,970
是啊 特别是当病人有神经症状时
Perfect. Especially if there wereneurological problems.

96
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,230
外星人绑架幻觉还不是神经症状?
What part of hallucinating an alien abduction isn't neurological?

97
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,890
不是幻觉
It wasn't a hallucination.

98
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,040
什么?
What?

99
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,470
- 你认为孩子真的遭绑架? - 是做噩梦
- You think the kid... - is having nightmares.

100
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,440
噩梦不是病状 只表明小孩需要和妈妈睡
Nightmares aren'ta symptom of anything other than wanting to sleep with mommy.

101
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:36,410
现在只剩下一个症状 流血的屁屁
Which just leaves uswith one symptom, the bloody tuchus.

102
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:39,720
消化道疾病或出血性疾病可以解释
Which can easily be explained by a G.I. Problemor a bleeding disorder.

103
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,060
做血凝检查 PT/PTT(凝血酶原) 还有出血时间
Check his coags with a pt,ptt,and bleeding time.

104
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,740
上下消化道都要做内镜
Prep him for endoscopiesfrom above and below.

105
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,110
要在你胳膊上轻轻扎一下
Gonna make a tiny nick in your forearm,okay?

106
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,390
然后看你要多长时间停止流血
Then I'm gonna time how longit takes for you to stop bleeding.

107
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,940
有点点疼 你转过头去
This is gonnasting a little, so you might want tolook the other way.

108
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,740
窗户是锁着的吗?
Are those windows locked?

109
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,070
这些窗户根本打不开 只是放进阳光
Those windowsdon't even open. They're just hereto let sunshine in.

110
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:18,300
好 因为他们知道我在这里
Good. 'Cause they know I'm here.

111
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,670
Clancy
clancy...

112
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,590
别跟医生胡说
don't bother the doctorwith this stuff.

113
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,040
没事的 他们怎么知道你在哪?
No,it's okay. How do they know you're here?

114
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,800
他们在我脖子里装了芯片 可以追踪我
They put a chip in my neck so they cankeep track of me.

115
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,190
我能感觉到
I can feel it back there.

116
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,870
Clancy 你知道那里什么也没有
Clancy,you knowthere is nothing back there.

117
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,030
有的
There is.

118
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,440
我看看 向前倾
Let me see. Lean forwards.

119
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:40,280
还装了别的东西 放在这两根肋骨中间
And they havethis other thing. And they put it...in between these two ribs.

120
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,020
一直在这边
Always on this side.

121
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:46,010
然后这东西在我身体里移动 很疼
And then they move itaround my insides. It hurts.

122
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,880
知道吗 Clancy?
You know what,clancy?

123
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,470
我可能找到芯片了
I think I might havefound the chip back there.

124
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,380
我可以取出来
And I think I might be able to get it out.

125
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,720
- 真的 - 嗯
- Really? - Mmm-hmm.

126
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,900
好的 向前倾
Okay,lean forwards.

127
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,890
坐稳了不要动
Now hold very still,okay?

128
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,650
好了
Got it.

129
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,750
我7岁 不是3岁
I'm seven... not three.

130
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,280
你只不过捏了一下我的脖子
All you didwas pinch my neck.

131
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,920
不好意思
Sorry.

132
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,950
他的外星劫持的故事 详细的程度...
His alien abduction story, the level of detail is...

133
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,430
我不知道他从哪里听来的
I don't knowwhere he gets it from.

134
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,770
他父母说他不看科幻片 不看漫画书
The parents sayhe doesn't watch sci-fi, he doesn't read comic books.

135
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:30,390
好极了 你做了医学上的事情没有?
Great. You do any of thatmedical stuff we talked about?

136
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,400
上下消化道的内镜都没发现问题
Upper d lower endoscopieswere clean.

137
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,140
那么 就只是一种出血性疾病
So,it's a simplebleeding disorder.

138
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,020
不 血液测试全都正常 他的血液在六分钟内凝结
No. Blood testswere all normal. And he clotted insix minutes.

139
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:41,010
这么说 是简单的出血性疾病 你的测试做错了
So it's a simplebleeding disorder and you screwed upthe test.

140
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,740
我没有做错
I didn't screw upthe test.

141
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,380
那么 这就是一个U.F.O.
So it's a U.F.O.

142
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,660
不明出血孔
Unidentified flowing orifice.

143
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,790
或者你检查出错 或者我的分析出错
Either youscrewed up the test or i screwed upmy analysis of this case.

144
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,590
如果是你搞砸了 我不用负责
If you screwed up,I don't have to cry myself to sleep.

145
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:57,300
是简单的出血性疾病 Foreman 重做测试
It's a simplebleeding disorder. Foreman,redo the test.

146
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,090
我怎么可能会搞砸一个 简单的出血时间试验?
How could I screw up a simplebleeding time test?

147
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,340
也许当时你被劫持了
Maybe you were abductedand lost time.

148
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,420
这个孩子有出血性疾病
Kid's got a bleeding disorder.

149
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:15,910
你确定?
You're sure?

150
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:18,630
流血25分钟 最后还是我止的血
I had to stopthe bleeding myself after 25 minutes.

151
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,430
所以 你是说Chase出错了
So you're sayingchase did screw up.

152
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,240
或者说Foreman出错了
Or foreman screwed up.

153
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,720
长针指示分钟  也许你搞混了
Big hand points to minutes. Maybe you got itmixed up.

154
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,930
噢 被鄙视了
Oh,snap.

155
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:35,540
Foreman在跟你打嘴仗呢 在文化上你可是大大的劣势 Chase (playing dozens是黑人强项)
Foreman's playin'the dozens. You're at a huge cultural disadvantage here,chase.

156
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,490
花几分钟来想一个聪明的反击
Take a couple minutesto think of a witty retort.

157
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,470
我们出血时间试验结果相互矛盾
So we have contradictingbleeding time tests.

158
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,660
如果我们在试验室检测他的凝血因子 我们就可以确定谁是对的
If we run labsto check his clotting factors, we can confirmwhich one's right.

159
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,140
测试 好主意
Yeah,testing. Nice idea.

160
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,760
比瞎猜哪个医生不合格好多了
Way better than trying to guess which doctor's incompetent.

161
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,700
而且写在病历上也好看些
Looks betterin the paperwork too.

162
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,710
嘿 Foreman 你妈妈好肥
Hey,foreman,your mama's so fat,

163
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,860
她的呼机响起来的时候 人们都以为要倒车
when her beeper goes off, people thinkshe's backing up.

164
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,040
Clancy在哪里?
Where's clancy?

165
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,940
他睡着了 他...
He's asleep. He'S...

166
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,470
House!
house!

167
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,090
Clancy不见了
Clancy's gone missing.

168
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,780
哦,不!
Oh,no!

169
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,490
你去人马座α星搜寻 Foreman去塔图音(星战地名)
You take alpha centauri, foreman can look on tatooine,

170
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:26,580
Cameron在星系间设卡堵截
and cameron can set upan intergalactic checkpoint.

171
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,760
祈祷一下他还没有进入超光速状态
Let's pray he hasn'tgone into hyperdrive.

172
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,330
那样就永远抓不到了
We'll never catch him.

173
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,220
Clancy?
Clancy?

174
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,350
我得到没有窗户的地方 那样我可以把芯片取出来 像你说的那样
I had to gowhere there are no windows so I could getthe chip out like you said.

175
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,120
上帝啊
GoD.

176
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:48,560
- 我可以感觉的到 就是拿不出来 - Clancy 停下来!
- I can feel it,I just can't grab it. - Clancy,stop!

177
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,820
没有什么芯片
There is no chip.

178
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,450
我们会把你洗干净 然后把你送回房间
We're gonna clean you upand we're gonna go back to your room.

179
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,090
你不能这样子做
You can't do thingslike this.

180
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,760
你的父母--
Your parents--

181
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,660
这东西可能不是地球上的
Said it might noteven be terrestrial.

182
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,490
真的?
Really?

183
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,830
不是 你个笨蛋 这是钛
No,you idiot,it's titanium.

184
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,030
比如因为手术植入的销子
Like from a surgical pin.

185
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:19,350
比如说这孩子四年前钉入断臂
Like the kind the kidhad inserted into his broken armfour years ago.

186
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,570
不错的病史
Nice medical history.

187
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,360
那个销子在那之后六个月就被移除了
That pin was removedsix months after--

188
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,960
有一小块在移除过程中断掉了
so a little piece broke offduring removal.

189
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,440
钛被用来建造核潜艇 不会就这么断掉
Titanium is used to build nuclear subs. Pieces don't just break off.

190
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,410
告诉这家伙库尔斯克的事
Tell that to guyson the kursk.

191
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,790
那它到底怎么从他的手臂 转移到他的脖子后面
And how exactly did it getfrom his arm to the back of his neck?

192
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,610
身体排斥任何的外物
Body attacksany foreign object.

193
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:39,490
炎症反应会使销子进入血管 碎片搭了个便车
Inflammatory reactioncould erode it into a vein,fragment gets a free ride.

194
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:42,090
也许会到肺里面 而不是颈部
To his lungs,maybe. Not his neck.

195
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:45,140
对 外星人的芯片更说得通
Yeah,an alien chipmakes more sense.

196
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,630
奇怪的是你没有搞砸
The real mystery is that you didn'tactually screw up.

197
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,090
你还好吧?
You okay?

198
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,830
没事 绊倒了
Fine. Tripped.

199
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:58,160
孩子在他的脖子后面挖了个洞 却没有因流血过多致死
Kid carved a hole in the back of his neck... and apparentlydidn't bleed to death.

200
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,470
这才是奇怪的
Now,that's weird.

201
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,210
他的血液自己凝固了?
He clotted on his own?

202
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,630
显然是的
Sure did.

203
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:06,610
所以开始没有出血性疾病 然后有了 现在又没有了
So first there wasno bleeding disorder, then there was,now there is not again.

204
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,880
这不可能
Which is impossible.

205
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,630
或者说是Foreman搞砸了 三个测试中有两个和我的结论一致
Or foreman screwed up. Two out of three testsagree with my findings.

206
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:15,140
算我们运气 第四个检查就见分晓了
Well,lucky for us, the fourth test will be the charm.

207
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,180
你们还要割他?
So you're just gonnakeep cutting him?

208
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,830
直到什么时候?
Until what?

209
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,500
这个测试不一样
This test is different.

210
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:28,700
我们抽取一些血样 看看是否有凝血因子不足或者缺失
We draw some blood and see if any clotting factorsare low or missing.

211
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,330
但是为什么其他的测试没能够--
But whyhaven't the other tests--

212
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:33,810
我们得到三个不一致的结果 肯定其中有一个是错的
we've got three resultsthat haven't been consistent.One of themmust be wrong.

213
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,450
或者其中两个
Or two of them.

214
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:38,810
有没有可能问题不是出在他的血液?
Is it possible the problemisn't his blood?

215
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,170
只是心理上的问题
It's just psychological.

216
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,130
我是说 他几乎杀死了自己
I mean,he almost killed himself.

217
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:46,120
他不是想要伤害自己
He wasn't tryingto hurt himself.

218
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,420
不...
No...

219
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,510
他只是在找一个外星跟踪装置
he was just looking for an alien tracking device.

220
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,020
我有时间再接一个病人
I have timefor one more.

221
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,790
你跑到这里加班 情有可原
Don't blame youfor spending extra time down here.

222
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,400
听说楼上的一个跛子行为艺术家回来了
Heard the artistformerly known as gimp is back upstairs.

223
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,290
哦,Cuddy医生要了那个病例
Oh,dr.Cuddywants that one.

224
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,260
她很忙 我来接手了
She's busy. I'll take it.

225
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,860
哦 天哪 你是...
Oh,my god. You're...

226
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,770
怎么会...
how...

227
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:14,570
你好了
you're okay.

228
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,430
我们见过么?
Have we met?

229
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,110
我是你其中一个医生
I was one of your doctors.

230
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,720
上个星期你离开这里的时候 你还是植物人的状态
You were ina vegetative state when you left here last week.

231
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,520
阿狄森氏病
Addison's disease.

232
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,200
我需要的就是一针可的松
All I needed was cortisol

233
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,020
就像按下开关一样我的大脑被启动了
and my brain turned onlike a switch.

234
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,400
这太让人惊讶了
This is amazing.

235
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,770
很惊讶你不知道
Surprised you didn't know.

236
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,050
我怎么会知道?
How would I know?

237
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,050
还没有完全回到过去的状态
Not quitemy old self yet.

238
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,600
婴儿学步 医生跟我说的
Baby steps,the doctors tell me.

239
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,010
就功能恢复来讲 你做的非常好 你去的是什么医院?
With rehab,you'll do great. What hospital did you go to?

240
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:44,210
- 我怎么会... - 我想要和我的妻子共享鱼水之欢
- How would I... - I wanna have sexwith my wife.

241
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,830
我想也许你可以...
And I was hoping that maybe...

242
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:47,940
你可以...
you could...

243
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,540
伟哥? 你来这里是为了要伟哥?
viagra? You're here for viagra?

244
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:53,180
多开一些
A bucketfulwould be nice.

245
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,900
Cuddy医生
Dr.Cuddy.

246
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,750
嗨
Hi.

247
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,560
这完全不道德
It's completely unethical.

248
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,560
- 他对待病人不顾后果 - 他是正确的
- He was recklesswith a patient. - He was right.

249
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,080
但是他不知道这些 他需要至少谦卑一点点
But he didn't know that. He needs at leastsome glimmer of humility.

250
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,790
为什么他需要这么做? 因为其他人是这样的?
Why doeshe need that? Because other peoplehave that?

251
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,150
他为什么需要像其他人一样?
Why does he need to belike other people?

252
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,130
他需要更多的考虑后果
He needs to beless reckless.

253
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,470
你成功了
Well,you did it.

254
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,970
他心不在焉 不求甚解 他很痛苦
He's dismissing symptoms, looking for easy solutions.He's in pain.

255
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,650
- 多痛? - 为什么问?
- How much pain? - Why?

256
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,430
你知道这会影响到他 是么?
You know this isaffecting him,don't you?

257
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:38,010
告诉他他解决了上一个病例 不会对他有任何帮助
Telling him that hegot his last case right won't do anything to help him.

258
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:40,370
- 这会减轻他的抑郁 - 这可能不会对他的腿有帮助
- It'll make himless depressed. - Which might nothelp his leg.

259
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,290
但是你说不准的
But you don't know.

260
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,730
就让我对他的丘脑做一个PET扫描 看看是不是感知到疼痛
Just let merun a pet scan on his parietal thalamic area to see if it's sensing pain.

261
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,860
如果是的 K他命不会再起效果 而他就面临一个很大的消沉
If it is,the ketamineisn't working anymore and he's headed fora huge crash.

262
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:57,100
如果不是 腿痛就是我的错误造成的 我会告诉他事实的
If it's not,the leg pain is my fault and I willtell him the truth.

263
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,940
太紧么?
Too tight?

264
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,020
我父母认为我疯了
My parentsthink I'm crazy.

265
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,370
不 他们没有
No,they don'T.

266
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:10,970
他们只是为你担心 就只是这样
They're justworried about you,that's all.

267
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,420
我不是怪人
I'm not weird.

268
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:15,610
只是怪事老是发生在我身上
It's just that weird thingskeep happening to me.

269
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,080
轻轻一下
Slight pinch.

270
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,680
如果你让我好转 外星人就不会来找我了吧
If you make me better,do you think the alienswill leave me alone?

271
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,420
我想他们不会打扰你很长时间了
I don't thinkthey're gonna be bothering you for much longer.

272
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,410
- 你又撒谎了? - 没有
- You lying again? - No.

273
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,250
我们找出病因 一切都会没事的
We figure this out,everything's gonna be okay.

274
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,660
你还清醒么?
You still with us?

275
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,660
肺水肿 高血压危象
Pulmonary edema,stage two hypertensive crisis.

276
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,310
- 发生了什么? - 到外面等
- What is happening? - Wait outside.

277
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,490
给他输氧 开始静脉点滴硝普钠
Get him oxygen. Start him on an iv drip of sodium nitroprusside.

278
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:02,050
让他们出去!
Get them outside!

279
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:05,710
他现在在重症监护病房 收缩压在170mmHg左右波动
He's in icu. Systolic is hoveringaround 170.

280
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:09,340
我下了医嘱 要缓慢降压 不能冒险 会造成器官供血不足
I left instructionsto lower it slowly so we don't riskhypoperfusing his organs.

281
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:14,010
保持这么高的血压 会有中风 心梗和失明的危险
The trade-off being thatleaving his blood pressure that high risks stroke,M.I.,And blindness.

282
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,960
我广开言路的
I'm open to suggestions.

283
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,680
解决病例
Solve the case.

284
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,610
- 肾脏可以用来解释... - 肾脏没有问题
- Kidneys could explain... - kidneys are clean.

285
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,400
告诉我他是一个变异的人种
Tell me he's a mutant/human hybrid.

286
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,170
是出血性疾病 clancy的血友病检测阳性
It is a bleeding disorder. Clancy tested positive for von willebrand'S.

287
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,150
我没有搞砸
I didn't screw up.

288
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,840
他怎么可能三次里面两次 靠自身凝血止住出血
How could he clot on his owntwo out of three times?

289
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,210
- 也许他作弊了 - 是啊
- Maybe he cheated. - right.

290
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,760
孩子总是在出血时间试验上作弊
Kids always cheat ontheir bleeding time tests.

291
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,790
她是在打比喻 她试着在模仿我
she was being metaphorical. She's tryingto sound like me.

292
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:47,670
我不知道你的意思是什么 但是我大概知道你葫芦里卖的是什么药
I have no ideawhat you meant, but I could smellwhat the rock was cooking.

293
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:51,250
我是说他现在血液可以凝结 而且他处在高血压危象中
I meanthe's clotting right now and he's inhypertensive crisis.

294
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,870
也许这两者有联系
Maybe the two e related.

295
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,390
可能另外两次他血液凝结的时候 是处于高血压中
What if he was hypertensive the other two times that he clotted?

296
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:58,430
高血压危象可以激发凝血因子
Hypertensive crisiscan activate clotting factors.

297
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,970
如果von willebrands因子减少 理论上可以促进凝血
Someone low onvon willebrands could theoretically clot.

298
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:05,840
而第一次Clancy凝血的时候 他都在激动的讲述他的外星劫持
And the first timeclancy clotted,he was all worked uprecounting his alien abduction.

299
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,540
很可能会血压升高
He could have easilybeen hypertensive.

300
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,850
如果要我把脖子里的芯片取出 我也会变激动的
I know I get worked up when I cut microchip trackingimplants out of my neck.

301
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,170
在我听起来像是作弊
Sounds like a cheat to me.

302
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:14,130
我们知道
Yeah,we get it.

303
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,180
多次高血压危象的七岁男孩 他的鉴别诊断是什么
Okay,what's the differentialfor seven-year-old boys suffering multiplehypertensive crises?

304
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,370
我们认为问题是在你们儿子的心脏上
We think the problemis in your son's heart.

305
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,330
我们得做一个经食道超声检查
We need to do a procedurecalled a transesophegeal echo.

306
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,300
好的 这可以治好他的心脏?
Okay,and that willfix his heart?

307
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,310
这可以告诉我们问题出在何处
That will tell uswhere the problem is.

308
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,450
希望如此
Hopefully.

309
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:36,330
然后我们可以治好他
Then we can fix him.

310
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,160
听着...
Listen...

311
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:49,100
这不是我的职责 但是...
this isn't reallypart of my job,but...

312
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,530
他担心你们认为他疯了
he's worried that you thinkhe's crazy.

313
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,840
难道没疯么?
Well,isn't he?

314
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:58,320
还有非常多其他的的解释
There are stillplenty of other explanations for what's going on.

315
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,980
重要的是他知道你们相信他
It's important he knowsyou believe in him.

316
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,110
即使你们不相信
Even if you don'T.

317
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,760
没有问题 心脏不是问题所在
it's clean. His heartisn't the problem.

318
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,280
为什么我的办公室 就没有高清屏幕?
Why don't I have a hi defin my office?

319
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,120
我是部门头头
I'm a department head.

320
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,540
- 没有结构性缺陷 - 瓣膜完整
- There are nostructural defects. - Valves are intact.

321
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:24,020
象素点这么小 怎么辨认组织?
Tissue characterizationis impossible when the pixelsare the size of legos.

322
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,580
看 这才像话!
See,this iswhat I'm talking about.

323
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,990
Foreman 帮我偷一个这
Foreman,you gottasteal this thing for me.

324
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,680
那我找找道上的朋友
Let me ring upone of the homies.

325
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,670
越清晰的图像 越证明没有肿块 没血块 没损伤
The clearer the image,the clearer it is that there are no masses,no clots,no tears.

326
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,710
问题一定出在别处
The problem's got to be somewhere else.

327
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,330
我们需要更大的船
We're gonna needa bigger boat.

328
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,280
你错了 House
You're wrong,house.

329
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:54,390
他不会闹到IMAX影院才肯认错吧
Think he'll make usbreak into the imax before he admits it?

330
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,620
- 那里 - 哪?
- There. - Where?

331
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,240
那里 左边 没有动
Right there.Left side. No movement.

332
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,840
别暂停
Well,don't freeze it.

333
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,330
某处没有动 全都不动怎么能看出某处没动
Something's not moving.How do you seesomething not move if nothing's moving?

334
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,350
我要个激光笔
I need a laser pointer.

335
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,930
- 要激光笔干嘛? - 为什么不可以?
- We don't havea laser pointer. - Well,why not?

336
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,710
没有激光笔太不像那么回事
Who's gonnatake us seriously if we don't have a laser pointer?

337
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,230
这里
Right here.

338
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,690
几千个心肌细胞没有跟随其它的一起动
A few thousand myocytesnot beating with the rest.

339
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,720
你发现心律不齐
So you foundan arrhythmia.

340
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,180
不是心律不齐 是根本没心率
That's not an arrhythmia. That's a no-rhythmia.

341
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,000
心肌细胞会收缩 这些根本没动
Myocytes contract. These aren't movingat all.

342
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,010
把它们切下来
Go get methose myocytes.

343
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:33,210
我要在办公室对它们训话
I want to talk to themin my office.

344
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,440
孩子怎么样?
How's the kid doing?

345
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,260
心脏几乎爆炸
Heart nearly exploded.

346
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,330
但还在跳动
Still beating,though.

347
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,150
至少大多数
Most of it anyway.

348
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,230
搞什么年龄限制 简直多此一举
Why do they botherputting age restrictions on these things

349
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,940
总要点一下 "我已满18"
when all you have to do is click"yes,I am 18"?

350
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,630
17岁的也知道怎么做
Even a 17-year-oldcan figure that out.

351
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,960
你的腿怎么了?
What's going onwith the leg?

352
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:00,240
先告诉我你的胸怎么了
First tell me what's going onwith the boobs.

353
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,190
- 如果你感到疼痛 - 它们好似更挺了
- If you're feeling pain... - they're firmer.

354
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,760
因为有钢丝!
It's called an underwire.

355
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,340
我要对你的大脑做PET扫描
I wanna geta pet scan of your brain.

356
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,470
我想是荷尔蒙作用
I think it's hormones.

357
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,960
如果丘脑部没有异常
As long as there'sno increased activity in the thalamus--

358
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,010
要我说简直可以加入乳品行业
looks to melike those puppies are going intothe dairy business.

359
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,950
那么疼痛是好事
Then the pain can be good.

360
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,460
可能是肌肉再生
It could be muscleregenerating.

361
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:21,910
你锻炼 肌肉会酸痛 疼痛不代表K他命治疗失效
After you work out,you get sore. Pain doesn't meanthe ketamine failed.

362
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:25,340
也许我应该恭喜你 孩子爹是谁?
Guess I should be sayingmazel tov. Who gets to pass outthe cigars?

363
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,920
我没怀孕!
I'm not pregnant.

364
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,550
我要对你的大脑做PET扫描
I need to geta pet scan of your brain.

365
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,970
男孩女孩? 想好名字没有?
Boy or girl? You got a name picked out?

366
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:31,780
- 我没怀孕 - 我的腿不疼
- I'm not pregnant. - My leg doesn't hurt.

367
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,720
- 你在逃避 - 不 我没有
- You're in denial. - No,I'm not!

368
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,370
好吧 算你赢
Oh,you got me.

369
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:45,470
如果我的腿在恶化
If I thought thatmy leg was deteriorating,

370
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,550
你以为我不会采取措施吗?
don't you think I'd want totake steps to prevent that?

371
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,470
好吧
Okay.

372
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,030
要走了
Gotta go.

373
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:04,000
哈
Ha.

374
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,550
这是Clancy的DNA
Here's clancy's dna.

375
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:15,300
那是从心脏病灶活检取得的DNA
And here's the dnafrom that piece of his heart we just biopsied.

376
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,790
不可能
That is impossible.

377
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,340
再做一次
Run it again.

378
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,020
已经重复过
We already did.

379
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,860
重复两遍
And once moreafter that.

380
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:33,890
心肌细胞的DNA和其它部位的不一致
The genesfrom clancy's myocytes don't match the genesfrom the rest of his body.

381
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,890
异型DNA
Alien dna.

382
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,930
谁看科幻片的给点提示
Anybody watch any x-files that inspired an explanation?

383
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:46,990
DNA有可能变异
there are waysdna can become mutated.

384
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,680
如果暴露在强紫外线下
Extreme uv radiation.

385
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,920
要有那么强的阳光 他的皮肤会变成健康的古铜色
That much sun,he'd be dying with a healthy bronze glow.

386
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,270
亚硝酸或者溴化乙锭
Nitrous acid or ethidium bromide exposure.

387
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:56,520
他爸爸原先是性虐狂 现在成化学家了
First daddy was a rapist,now he's a chemist.

388
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,890
多种真菌能导致DNA变异
various species of fungus have been proven mutagenic.

389
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:03,320
除非他狂吃芹菜 要么他住在印尼 或者两者皆有
Not unless the kid'sbeen eating barrels of celery or livingin indonesia or both.

390
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,320
- 你的腿又疼了 - 这种问题有用么?
- Is your leg hurting? - Is that question helping?

391
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,460
- 你站歪了 - 你坐着
- You're leaning. - You're sitting.

392
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,280
- 你在单脚站 - 我头疼
- You're evading. - My head's hurting.

393
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,510
请给我一个合适的
Please,someone give mea plausible,

394
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:15,550
不涉及外星生物的解释 关于孩子的异型DNA
terrestrial explanationfor this kid's alien dna.

395
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:18,860
我们可以到他家寻找毒物 真菌或者辐射源
We could search his homefor toxins, fungals,and radiation.

396
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,640
管他是什么导致的
Who cares what caused it?

397
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,190
小孩喉咙感染链球菌 我们会治好他
A kid comes in with a strep, we don't conduct a search to see

398
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,540
而不是去研究哪个同学传染给他
which classmatehe got it from,we cure it.

399
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,190
知道有东西在他体内 那就切掉
We know he's got this inside him. Let's get a scalpeland cut it out.

400
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:30,250
在哪儿切?  也许不仅在心脏
Where do we cut? Chances are it's notjust in his heart.

401
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,760
发现心脏的毛病是我们走运
we got luckywith the heart.

402
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,290
肌细胞会收缩 所以 能看出那些细胞没有动
Myocytes contract,we could see that these weren't working.

403
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:37,440
别的地方有毛病怎么发现?
I don't know how the hellwe're gonna find it anywhere else.

404
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:43,920
我们在带有不正常DNA的心肌上取样 然后标记它们怎么样?
What if we takethe heart cells with the bad dnaand we tag them?

405
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,090
能打个比方吗?
Can you phrase thatin the form of a metaphor?

406
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:49,960
和我们寻找肿瘤是一个办法
It's the same waywe search for cancer.

407
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,390
异常DNA会在细胞表面 产生独特的蛋白质
The bad dna creates a unique protein on the surface of the affected cells.

408
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:56,090
我们再合成一种 只能识别那种蛋白质的抗体
We create an antibodythat recognizes only that protein.

409
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:59,900
然后向他体内注入大量这样的抗体 那些相应的细胞就会...
We flush it throughout his system and the similar cells light up like...

410
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,950
像灯泡一样亮起来
lightbulbs.

411
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,740
好 就这么干了
Okay. Let's do that.

412
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,990
你们得告诉他
You have to tell him.

413
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:20,060
- 他说他一点也不疼 - 他在骗你们
- He said he wasn'tin any pain. - He's lying.

414
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,450
那是当然
Of course he's lying.

415
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:22,960
得订一个新计划
We need another plan.

416
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,370
别那么说
Don't talk about itthat way.

417
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:25,660
别怎么说?
What way?

418
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:28,760
计划 听起来就像 我们在对他耍什么阴谋诡计
Plan. Sounds likewe're conspiring against him.

419
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,760
- 我要去告诉他 - 你不能说
- I'm gonna tell him. - No,you're not.

420
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,610
那就赶紧订一个巧妙的计划
Then come upwith a cunning plan and fast.

421
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:40,690
她一定也不像她想象的那样讨人喜欢
She's not nearly as delightfulas she thinks she is.

422
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,260
这机器是干嘛的?
What's this machine do?

423
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,210
它制造出好多噪音
It makes a lot of noise.

424
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,040
同时帮我们看看你到底出啥问题了
And it's gonna help usfigure out what's wrong with you.

425
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,310
你认为 House 走错了一步?
You think househas lost a step?

426
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:54,100
他没事
He's fine.

427
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:59,790
在那 股骨骨髓中有一团受侵袭的细胞
There,a clump of affected cellsin the bone marrow of the femur.

428
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,650
解释了为什么有断断续续的出血紊乱
Explains the intermittentbleeding disorder.

429
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:05,120
如果House不比我们强 我不必屈服于他的折磨
'Cause I don't need tosubject myself to house's tortureif there's no upside.

430
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,420
我说了 他没问题
I'm telling you,he's fine.

431
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:12,250
我们还遗漏了其他受侵袭的心肌细胞
We missed some affected cells in his heart.

432
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,660
这解释了他持续的高血压问题
Explains the continuinghypertensive issues.

433
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:17,580
你说他的上一个病例打击了House 怎么你现在突然...
You said the last casereally threw him. And now suddenly...

434
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,920
我说错了
I was wrong.

435
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,060
所以你改变主意了
So you changedyour mind.

436
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,570
为什么?
Why?

437
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,480
他在这个病例上的 所有天才想法都是你的
His brilliant ideason this case have all been yours.

438
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,440
他为什么需要带眼镜?
There's the reason for him needing glasS.

439
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:32,690
很明显这是一种病症 说明他的病很早就...
Apparently it's a symptom. Means the condition predates--

440
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:34,610
没原因的话你是不会改变主意的
you don't change your mindwithout a reason.

441
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,260
你知道什么了?
What do you know?

442
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,480
House...
House...

443
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,910
在上个病例里没有错
didn't blow the last case.

444
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:47,380
Cuddy用House的建议治好了那人
Cuddy cured the guyusing house's idea.

445
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,780
但Cuddy和 Wilson想教他学会谦虚
Cuddy and wilsonare trying to teach him some humility.

446
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,760
扫描完了 三个病灶 但是没有一个在大脑中
Scan is complete. Three hot spots,but nothing in his brain.

447
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,200
House 原来的理论是对的
House's original theorywas right.

448
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,820
不是神经方面的问题
It is not neurological.

449
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,370
以后他还能走路吗?
is he gonna be able to walk?

450
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:07,880
恢复后他的腿应该还是有功能的
his leg should be functional after some rehab.

451
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:11,280
有功能? 什么意思?
Functional? What does that mean?

452
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,550
他能走 但是不能跑? 他会瘸吗?
He's be able to walkbut not run? He'll have a limp?

453
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,140
如果一切顺利的话 他能走也能跑
If everything goes well,he'll walk,he'll run.

454
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,840
甚至会比现在更强壮
He'll probably beeven stronger than he is now.

455
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:24,310
当他被麻醉后 我们打开他的腿
Whwhen we close him up,we'll move over to his other leg.

456
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:27,640
把一根导管从股动脉插进去直到心脏
Snake a catheter up through the femoral artery and into his heart.

457
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,100
当异常细胞被移走后 正常组织就可以行使功能
Once the affected areas are removed, his normal tissue will set back in and do its job.

458
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,690
他也不该再会有血压方面的问题了
He should have no more problemswith his blood pressure.

459
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:40,200
当我们确定那些区域已经清除干净后 就会进行最后的程序
After confirmingthose areas are clear, we'll startthe final procedure.

460
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:45,150
我将向瞳孔中插入一根针 把视网膜上的那些异常细胞清除掉
I'm gonna insert a needlethrough the pupil and get rid of theabnormal cells in the retina.

461
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,190
把右眼闭上
Close your right eye.

462
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,190
能看到我的脸吗?
Can you see my face?

463
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,230
能 很清楚
Yeah. It's clear.

464
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,700
你可以把你的眼镜扔掉了 一切搞掂
You can throw awayyour glasses. We got it all.

465
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,910
睡会儿吧
Get some sleep.

466
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,780
明天你就回家了
You're going home tomorrow.

467
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:08,940
谢谢你
Thank you.

468
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,200
想出去跑跑吗?
You wannago for a run?

469
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,810
你想干啥?
What do you want?

470
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:27,190
我想你没事跑跑
I want you to run.

471
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,860
你什么时候变成一个促进者了?
When did youbecome an enabler?

472
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,200
我想敦促你多运动运动
I'm enabling youto exercise.

473
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:40,000
Vicodin(止痛药)阻止了疼痛 你挺过了你的恢复期
Vicodin blocks the pain, you get through your rehab.

474
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,100
肌肉力量增强 疼痛减少
Muscle strength increases,and pain decreases.

475
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,430
我可不想靠止痛片来过日子
I'd rather not becomedependent on pain pills to get through my day.

476
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:50,220
你和其他病人真是太像了
You're just likeany other patient.

477
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:53,590
装作不知道不会使你快乐
Running away from knowledgethat won't make you happy.

478
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,130
我就像个撇大条的小猪一样快乐
I'm as happyas a pig in poop.

479
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:58,340
你害怕K他命的治疗效果会逐渐消失
You're scared the ketaminetreatment's wearing off.

480
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,270
那只是一个...
That it was just A...

481
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:02,320
通向美好生活的一个痛苦窗口
torturous windowto the good life.

482
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,510
是哪一部分大条难道你不知道吗?
What part of poopdidn't you understand?

483
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:07,470
为什么你如此肯定那不是肌肉酸痛?
How can you be so sureit isn't just a sore muscle?

484
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,010
因为这是我的腿
It's my leg.

485
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,410
我们认识彼此很久了
We've known each othera long time.

486
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,950
你并不总是对的 House
You're not always right,house.

487
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,330
你近来已有证明
You've proven that lately.

488
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,270
- 他怎么了? - 他癫痫发作了
- What's happening to him? - He's seizing.

489
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:01,130
- 给我氯硝安定 - 我以为你们都治好了!
- I need clonazepam. - I thought you got it all!

490
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:03,310
好 继续朝我吼 那样孩子就能治好了
Yeah,yell at me. That'll fix the kid.

491
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:07,220
显然我们遗漏了某些外来的组织 还有一些在他的体内
bviously we missedsome foreign tissue. There's somethingstill in him.

492
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:10,980
幻觉的发作意味着颞前叶出了问题
The hallucinationsand seizures indicate problemsin the temporal lobe.

493
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:13,620
对不起 House 这是个神经上的问题
Sorry,house,it is neurological.

494
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,530
看起来你又错了一次
Looks likeyou were wrong,again.

495
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:17,120
我们什么也没漏掉
We didn't miss anythinG.

496
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,200
大脑的扫描一点问题也没有
The brain scanwas completely clean.

497
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:27,310
我们的标记物一定没有穿透血脑屏障
Our tag must not have penetratedthe blood brain barrier.

498
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:30,680
这次不要走静脉了 直接进大脑
Don't use an iv this time, get it right into the brain.

499
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,370
没有细胞亮起来
no cells are lighting up.

500
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,560
他的大脑没问题
His brain is clean.

501
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,630
不是神经问题
It is not neurological.

502
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,800
他的症状是神经性质的
His symptomsare neurological.

503
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,840
肯定是由神经引起的
His conditionhas to be neurological.

504
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,570
扫描了两次都没问题
His scan was clean twice.

505
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,370
不在大脑里
It's not there.

506
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:01,070
会不会它就在那里 而只是扫描不出来呢?
What if it is there, but didn't show up on the scan?

507
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:03,510
会不会标记物在大脑里没用了呢?
What if the tagjust doesn't work in his brain?

508
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:07,170
大脑细胞的结构是不同的 他们表达不同的蛋白质
Brain cellsare structurally different. They express a different protein.

509
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,770
那我们怎样才能发现它?
So how do we find it?

510
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,950
我们去哪?
Where are we going?

511
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,740
我去思考
I am going to think.

512
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:55,700
把那孩子送回家
Send the kid home.

513
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,460
你是什么意思?
What do you mean?

514
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:01,520
确保他的血压正常 把他送回家
Make sure his blood pressureis stabilized and send him home.

515
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,560
就像什么事都没发生一样?
Like nothing ever happened?

516
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,760
我们治好了他的出血紊乱
We curedhis bleeding disorder

517
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,990
清除了所有我们能发现的被损坏细胞
and removed all the damagedcells we could find.

518
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:11,570
我们并不知道我们治好了什么 这才一天
We don't knowthat we fixed anything. It's only been a day.

519
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:14,100
也许这些症状就会像 出血紊乱一样间歇发作
Maybe these symptoms come and go like the blood disorder.

520
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,270
更有可能他其余的症状仅仅只是
It's more probablethat his remaining symptoms are

521
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,800
一个恶梦
just a nightmare.

522
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,120
可他产生了惊厥
He had a convulsion.

523
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,500
也许是癫痫 也许是心理疾病
Maybe epilepsy,maybe psychological.

524
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,890
也许什么都不是
Maybe nothing.

525
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:29,490
如果孩子又病了 会给我们 新的线索 我们再次调查
If the kid gets sick again,that'll give us another clue and we'llstart searching again.

526
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:32,270
如果没有 那就没事了
If he doesn't,it doesn't matter.

527
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:34,840
送他回家吧
Send him home.

528
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,430
House!
House!

529
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,470
你就这么放弃这个孩子了
You're just giving upon this kid?

530
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,150
你得知道什么时候该停手
You gotta knowwhen to stop.

531
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:53,890
可你不会停手
You don't stop.

532
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:56,960
你从不会停手 你会一直坚持下去直到做出一些
You never stop,you just keep on going until you come up

533
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,250
常常是正确的疯狂事情
with something so insane that it's usually right.

534
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:02,600
除了上个病例
Except on my last case.

535
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:05,190
别装可怜
Don't be pathetic.

536
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:07,120
忘了上个病例吧
Just forgetthe last case.

537
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,430
这孩子明显有些不对头
This kid obviouslyhas something wrong with him.

538
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:15,840
什么时候你对我的病人 有如此强硬的主张了?
When did you developsuch strong opinions about my patients?

539
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,270
上星期你还确信我的病人没病
Last week you were convinced that my patient wasn't sick.

540
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,870
现在你又确信这个有病
Now you're convincedthis one is.

541
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,710
因为这是一个小男孩
This oneis a young boy.

542
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,470
他爸妈都绝望了
His parents are desperate.

543
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:27,710
只需回到你的团队 多花一点时间...
Just get togetherwith your team, spend a few extra hours...

544
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,140
好吧 我想我们可以切除他的左腿
well,I guess we couldamputate his left leg.

545
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:33,800
在那里发现最多 还要把受侵袭的眼球摘掉
It's wherewe found most of it.Maybe we should just removehis affected eye completely.

546
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,460
如果你相信那养对他好...
If you have reason to believethat that might help...

547
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:39,340
我不会去切他的身体
I'm not gonna startlopping off body parts.

548
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,900
但是很有意思 你给我开了绿灯
But it's interesting that yougive me the green light.

549
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,940
我只是想你有所作为
I just want youto do something.

550
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:48,850
这一个星期来你的支持已经过头了
You've been overly supportivethis entire week.

551
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:52,220
要么是受到荷尔蒙 要么是负罪感的驱使
Well,either you're hormonal or you're guilt-ridden.

552
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,250
当然对于怀孕来说 受到荷尔蒙影响还早了些
And it's too earlyin the pregnancy for this to be hormonal.

553
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,710
- 我没有怀孕 - 那你做错什么了?
- I'm not pregnant. - Then what did you do wrong?

554
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,190
他确实有阿狄森氏病
He had addison'S.

555
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:10,860
你的上个病人 你是对的
Your last patient. You were right.

556
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:17,070
我给他打了一针可的松 然后他就像 Rip Van Winkle 一样醒来 (美国短篇小说，其主人公一觉睡了20年)
I gave him one shot of cortisoland he work up like rip van winkle.

557
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:24,320
噢 你妈妈碰到麻烦了
Oh,your mommy'sin such trouble.

558
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,160
她是个骗子
She's such a liar.

559
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,350
这就是你为啥没有老爸 为啥她不得不...
That's why youdon't have a daddy. That's why she had to...

560
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,520
一个人怎么可能...
how does one person...

561
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:42,620
带着两套不同的 DNA?
end up withtwo different sets of dna?

562
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,910
- 我们已经谈过了 - 我们的假设不对
- We've been through this. - Our assumptions are faulty.

563
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:49,400
我们已经确认有两套 DNA 序列测了不止一次
We've confirmedtwo different sets of dna. We re-ran the sequence.

564
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,780
我没说实验室搞错了 我是说我们的假设错了
I didn't say the lab workwas faulty, I said our assumptionswere faulty.

565
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,890
我们假设他是一个人
We assumedhe's a person.

566
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:58,770
当然了 外星人不仅仅拜访了他 还把他给换了
Of course.The aliensdidn't just visit him, they replaced him.

567
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:01,050
你真笨
You're being silly.

568
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,900
如果他不是一个人 而是两个人?
What if he's not a person? What if he's two persons?

569
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,010
- 我不懂你的比喻 - 没有比喻
- I'm not gettingthe metaphor. - No metaphor.

570
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,630
Chase说他妈妈曾接受过人工授精 对吗?
Chase said the mom used in vitro fertilization,right?

571
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,030
是的 他们无法受孕
Yeah,they had troubleconceiving.

572
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:14,290
孩子一直没问题 直到他被植入了某些东西
Kid was right all along. He was implanted with something.

573
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,150
回到他小时候 我是说 很小的时候 比如只有12个细胞时
Back when he was young. I mean,really young.Like 12 cells young.

574
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,100
体外培养增加了双胞胎的可能性
In vitro increasesthe likelihood of twinning.

575
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,530
可是他没有孪生兄弟
But he doesn't havea twin.

576
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:23,970
别绕远了...
Not walking around...

577
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,370
但人工授精费用是2万5千美金
but in vitro fertilization costs around 25 grand a pop.

578
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:30,930
所以要移植2到6个胚胎 以使物有所值
So doctors implant two to six embryos to make sure you get your money's worth.

579
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:34,700
问题是 并不总有足够的卧室 给这些小宝贝们住
The problem is,there's not always enough bedrooms for all the kiddies.

580
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,940
所以两兄弟就不得不分享一个空间 却没有上下铺
Two brothers get stuck sharing, but there's no bunk beds.

581
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:40,570
所以他们就抱在一起取暖 而且再也不会分开
So they cuddle up to keep warm and they never untangle.

582
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,220
他是合二为一
He's two people in one.

583
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,650
这就叫嵌合体 (Chimera 希腊神话中的合体怪物)
It's called chimerism.

584
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,340
不幸的是 他兄弟...
Unfortunately,his brother'S...

585
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,250
像是一个坏的替身
like a bad doubles partner.

586
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,010
那家伙只是占据空间 拦在路上
The guy just takes up space,gets in the way.

587
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:59,400
Clancy的身体认为能将他轻松干掉
Clancy's body thinks he's gonnaput away the easy winners,

588
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,780
但他兄弟一直发挥出色
his brother just keepsswatting the balls into the net.

589
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,910
我们得把他从球场上拽下来了
We gotta get himoff the court.

590
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:10,150
你能找出他大脑中的坏细胞? 能还是不能?
So does that meanthat you can find the bad cellsin his brain or not?

591
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:14,290
好吧 不用比喻形式也可以
Sure,abandon the metaphor. Fine.

592
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:19,080
Clancy 和他兄弟想得不一样 因为他也在思考
Clancy thinks differentlythan his brother... because he thinks.

593
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,900
如果我们诱导一个外星人诱拐行动...
If we inducean alien abduction...

594
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,600
等等 你到底在说什么?
wait,what the hellare you talking about?

595
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,520
你儿子的脑中一直有外来DNA
The foreign dnahas got to be in the portionof your son's brain

596
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,780
所以他相信自己被诱拐了
that makes him believe that he's being abducted.

597
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:33,510
用电极刺激这些神经元 就能哄骗你儿子的大脑产生幻觉
If we stimulate those neuronswith an electric probe,we can trick your son's braininto hallucinating.

598
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:38,440
你儿子的神经元就会亮起来 而他兄弟的细胞会继续保持黑暗
Your son's neurons will light up, and his brother's cellswill remain dark.

599
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:40,990
那就是我们要切除的部分
Those are the oneswe cut out.

600
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:43,050
你是在说一个脑外科手术
You're talking aboutbrain surgery.

601
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:46,380
我说的是一个很酷的脑外科手术
I'm talking aboutreally cool brain surgery.

602
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,170
你的一个儿子会死
One of your sons will die.

603
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:51,300
但是个子高的那个 再也不会有人烦他
But the taller one won't beso annoying anymore.

604
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,510
这么说我有一个孪生兄弟?
So I have a twin?

605
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,850
不一定
Not really.

606
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:57,220
卡片上有什么?
What's on the card?

607
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,410
电灯泡
Light bulb.

608
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:00,010
让我们从10开始
Start us out at ten.

609
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:07,240
我没有动
I'm not doing that.

610
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,000
是我做的 孩子 对不起
It was all me,kid. Sorry.

611
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,400
你在活动区域
You're in motor function.

612
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,820
试着往后退2厘米
Try two centimeters back.

613
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,910
他住在我身体里
He lives inside me.

614
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,290
差不多
Sort of.

615
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,520
好痒 别挠我的脚了
That tickles. Stop tickling my feet.

616
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:22,680
你到了感知区域 再近点
You're in sensory. Getting closer.

617
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:25,600
- 这张上你看到了什么? - 月亮和星星
- What do you seeon this one? - Moon and stars.

618
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,270
那么...
So...

619
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,280
我是不是很奇怪?
I am kind of weird?

620
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,410
我们都很奇怪
We're all kind of weird.

621
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,570
不!
No!

622
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,760
- Clancy? - 有状况
- Clancy? - We got something.

623
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,790
- 你看到什么了? - 光
- What do you see? - The light.

624
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:45,470
他们来了 我想
Here they come. I think.

625
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:47,590
脑电波显示轻度幻觉
Brain waves indicate mild hallucination.

626
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,880
- 神经元亮起来了 - 那些暗点呢?
- Neurons are lighting up. - Any dark spots?

627
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,640
- 区域太模糊了 - 幻觉还不够强烈
- area's too fuzzy. - Hallucinationisn't strong enough.

628
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,380
提高刺激强度
Turn up the juice.

629
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:59,340
他的血压已经160/110了 再高的话...
His blood pressure's alreadyat 160 over 110. Any higher and...

630
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,510
变傻瓜总比没命好
riding the short bus is betterthan not breathing.

631
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,290
加到100
Take us to 100.

632
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,260
区域还是太模糊了 无法区别
Area's still too fuzzy to make any kind of distinction.

633
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,550
再加高
Crank it up higher.

634
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,550
你已经超过预设的最大值了
You've already exceededthe pre-set maximum.

635
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,050
再加下去大脑就要被毁了
Next step's brain damage.

636
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:28,060
他们要抓走你 他们正穿过围墙
They're gonna get you. They're comingthrough the walls.

637
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,370
他们要抓走你 折磨你
They're gonna take you,torture you.

638
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,970
你再也看不到你爸妈了
You'll never see your parents again.

639
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:58,440
Clancy 能听到我说话吗?
Clancy,can you hear me?

640
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,320
Clancy?
Clancy?

641
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:08,350
你抓到他们了
You got them.

642
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,300
一点没错
Yep.

643
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,680
把他们全抓住了
We got 'em all.

644
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,370
收尾吧
Close him up.

645
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:19,580
一切再次恢复正常
Everything's gonnabe normal again.

646
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:34,450
你相信Cuddy会耍我吗?
You believe what cuddytried to pull?

647
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:36,910
又怎么了?
What now?

648
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:38,980
她骗了我
She lied to me.

649
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,550
她利用我的诊断治好了我的病人 然后她撒了谎
She cured my patientwith my diagnos, then she lied about it.

650
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,510
听起来可不像她
That doesn'tsound like her.

651
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:45,750
没错
You're right.

652
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,480
但是像你
Does soundlike you,though.

653
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,630
Cuddy到底跟你说了什么?
What exactlydid cuddy tell you?

654
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:59,340
和你现在的身体语言所告诉我的一样
Nothing thatyour body language isn't telling me right now.

655
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,140
计划是怎样的?
So what was the plan?

656
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:08,660
由于无法治好一个病人 而变得如此谦逊...
I'd feel so humbled by missing a case...

657
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:14,760
重新评估我的整个生活 领悟真和善 变成 Cameron?
that I'd re-evaluatemy entire life,question the natureof truth and goodness,and become cameron?

658
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,580
差不多是那样的
Something like that.

659
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,270
如果我们告诉你真相
More that if we told you the truth,

660
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:23,910
你解决了一个病例 却不基于任何医学证据
that you'd solved a casebased on absolutely no medical proof,

661
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,030
你会认为自己是上帝的
you'd think you were god.

662
