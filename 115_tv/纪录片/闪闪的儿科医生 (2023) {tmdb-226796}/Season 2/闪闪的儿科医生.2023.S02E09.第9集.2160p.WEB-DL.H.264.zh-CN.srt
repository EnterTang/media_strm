00:00:00,598 --> 00:00:03,222
Announcer: <i>Calamari  stolen the lead, but Ample Parking is making strides,</i>

3
00:00:03,289 --> 00:00:07,659
<i>and is now at fourth, third, and holding second place, while Blue Calamari is at steady speed.</i>

4
00:00:07,743 --> 00:00:11,326
<i>And down the stretch they come! Ample Parking comes from behind.</i>

5
00:00:11,514 --> 00:00:14,115
<i>It's Ample Parking by a nose!</i>

6
00:00:15,528 --> 00:00:17,957
<i>This is the last call for the third race.</i>

7
00:00:18,088 --> 00:00:21,815
<i>You may still wager if you hurry. Here's your information on the race ...</i>

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,290
让开，瘸子来了
Out of the way. Cripple coming through.

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,960
6号买金子输
Um, 6 race at Golden Downs. I'll take the two and the four.

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,690
2块买4号

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,370
嘿，那是我的生日
Hey, that's my birthday. February 4th, 1963. I think that's a good bet?

12
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:36,150
2月4号

13
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,910
我看这会是个不错的赌注
Oh, wh-what's your birthday?

14
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,020
你的生日是多少？
Take your time. Don't worry. There's only 30 seconds to post.

15
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,370
慢慢来
Is there any way I can bet on the 6 and the 3 also?

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,630
别担心只有30秒钟下注的时间
You know, for the year? All four horses. Can I do that?

17
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,660
有没有办法我再买3号第2位 一整年，我可以那么做么？
He wants a $2.00 exacta box - 2, 4, 6, 3. Give him $24.

18
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,900
他要买2号整注，给他24块

19
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,200
该你了
Mm-hmm.

20
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,170
3号马买赢，终结者赢
Your turn.

21
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,620
整个一注，复合赛胜出
9th at Gulfstream Park. 500 on the three horse. Seminal Uprising to win.

22
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,770
干脆烧钱算了

23
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,740
我要燃烧我的胜利
Might as well burn your money.

24
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,710
火焰更烈
I'll burn my winnings. Bigger flame.

25
00:01:09,226 --> 00:01:10,631
Announcer: <i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

26
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,630
买同样的注
Same race, TermiGator to win.

27
00:01:13,143 --> 00:01:14,262
<i>Flag is up.</i>

28
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,930
终结者赢
- Sorry, race just closed. - Damn it.

29
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,740
对不起，到时间了

30
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,730
真该死
She was 14 to 1, too.

31
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,220
是1/14的赔率
That fat ass over there just saved you money.

32
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,860
那就用那个胖屁股去省钱吧
- No way Seminal Uprising is... - I don't bet on the horses.

33
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,030
你不必那么辛辣吧
I bet on the jocks. My rider is bulimic.

34
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,550
我意思是马屁股

35
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,480
我的坐骑会赢
Purses after his weigh-ins.

36
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,850
在最终的第8局
Leave a 2-pound pile at the starting gate, shaves valuable time of that final 8th.

37
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,700
它一定会胜出的

38
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,970
有小道消息真棒
Nice to have inside information.

39
00:01:36,917 --> 00:01:41,990
<i>Leads at the stretch by a length, the Burning Bush. And on the level is Andy right up on the inside...</i>

40
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:43,978
[Clash and thud]

41
00:01:45,236 --> 00:01:47,656
[Breathes with difficulty]

42
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,740
这有医生吗?
Is anybody here a doctor?

43
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:54,303
[Breathes with difficulty]

44
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,980
找感觉呢?
You tryin' to cop a feel?

45
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,890
我在青年会学过急救课程
I took a CPR class at the Y.

46
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,380
如果她不是抽筋而是犯 心脏病那没准有用
That would be useful if she was having a heart atack instead of seizure.

47
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,500
抽筋？要把她的舌头压下去么？
Seizure? Hold her tangue down?

48
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:07,990
如果你想把手指咬掉的话
If you wanna get a finger bitten off. Call an ambulance.

49
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,180
叫急救车
Methodistis 3 blocks down. I could drive her.

50
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,670
急救站就在3条街外

51
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,230
－我可以开车送她 －打电话吧
Just make the call.

52
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,080
那是什么鬼东西?
Man: What the hell is that?

53
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,590
我怎么会知道?
How should I know?

54
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,260
告诉急救人员把她送到PP医院去
Tell the paramedics to take her to Princeton-Plainsborough.

55
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,910
医生名叫豪斯
The doctor's name is House.

56
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,790
终结者以两个身长获胜
<i>And it's TermiGator winning by 2 lengths!</i>

57
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:38,826
2x09 - Deception

58
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,960
House - [豪斯医生] 第二季 第九集

59
00:03:00,804 --> 00:03:04,284
Original Airdate (FOX): 13-DEC-2005

60
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,680
我真纳闷豪斯怎么会 对那些电视屏那么上瘾
This is one does House hang out at OTB?

61
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:08,670
那家伙是个瘾君子
Man's an addict.

62
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,510
是，是对药品成瘾，不是赌博
Right, addicted to pills, not gambling.

63
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:14,020
那是同类事件：药品成瘾，酗酒，赌博
Same thing - drug abuse, drinking, gambling.

64
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,680
它们都可以激活脑部欣快中枢
They all fire up the same pleasure centers in the brain.

65
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,320
成瘾就是成瘾……
An addict is an addict is...

66
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,340
赌博又不能把他的痛感带走
Gambling doesn't take away his pain.

67
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,840
我赢了的话就可以
It does when I win.

68
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,320
火辣的赌马宝贝
Hot OTB babe has grand mal and inexplicable bruising.

69
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,010
癫痫发作

70
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,260
身上有不明原因的瘀伤

71
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,910
-那又怎样? -她开始抽搐的时候你就在边上 那么站着么？
What up with that?

72
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:32,173
You were just standing there and she started to seize?

73
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,760
花点跟我一样多的时间跟真人在一起
Spend as much time around the real people as I do, someone gets sick.

74
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,780
会有人生病的
Platelets are 89. She's anemic.

75
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,360
血小板89

76
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:38,900
她贫血

77
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,550
而且她血液酒精浓度是1.3
And she has a blood alcohol level of .13.

78
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,410
火辣的赌马宝贝?
Hot OTB babe?

79
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,830
显然是个妓女
Obviously a working girl. Probably an STD, infection.

80
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,710
没准是站街的，感染

81
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,530
不发热，没感染
No fever, no infection.

82
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,380
酒精滥用可以解释
Alcohol abuse explains it all.

83
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,190
导致抽搐并影响她血液的凝结能力
Causes seizures and affects her blood's ability to clot, which causes bruising.

84
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,520
从而导致瘀伤
Start her on heparin. She'll be fine by morning.

85
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,280
给她一点肝磷脂，早晨就没事了

86
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,140
但是她的瘀伤并没有斑点
Except for the fact that the bruises are not petechial, which means it's not DIC.

87
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,620
所以不是dic

88
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,650
那瘀伤就是由外伤造成的
So the bruises were caused by trauma.

89
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,580
她也许被她男朋友痛打 或是批条客
She probably got beat up by her boyfriend. Or her pimp.

90
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,890
未见其人先行评价叫什么来着？
What's that called when you judge someone before ever meeting them?

91
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,150
她是场外赌博的常客
She's a regular at OTB.

92
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,060
反正不觉得她是朝九晚五族 家庭主妇族
Somehow I don't see her holding down a 9-to-5 and going to PTA meetings.

93
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,060
我在场
I was there.

94
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,610
我有个朝九晚三的工作
I have a "9-to-3" job.

95
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,850
可能是sle 家族毛细血管扩张症
It could be SLE, familial telangiectasis,

96
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,050
甚至是库辛症
- or even Cushing's. - Good. Start with those.

97
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,710
好，由这些入手吧

98
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,260
－哪一个？ －库辛症
- Which one? - Cushing's.

99
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,970
可以解释抽搐和瘀伤
Explains the seizure and the bruising.

100
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,040
但不能解释贫血
Not the anemia.

101
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,430
她没吃很多肉
So she doesn't eat a lot of meat.

102
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,440
酗酒导致Dic更贴切
DIC brought on by alcohol abuse is far more likely. Do a full workup.

103
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,680
做全套检查吧
H and P. And lab her up, LP, MRI.

104
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,530
H和P，给她建实验室档案

105
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,950
lp和mri.
Wh-Whoa!

106
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,890
哇……

107
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:43,520
你刚才是明确下令 让我去找她的医疗记录么?
Did you just ever-so-subtly order me to get her medical history?

108
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,390
卡迪上周起让我负责了，所以……
Cuddy put me in charge last week. So...yeah.

109
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,390
对的

110
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,310
是假装负责
It was a pretend in charge.

111
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,630
在诉讼结束前遮掩一下
Formality to get past the suits in legal.

112
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,790
对，那些许可证批准人员喜欢化装 舞会和假装的玩意
Right, those licensing board folk love to play dress-up and pretend.

113
00:04:58,970 --> 00:04:59,980
嘿，别担心
Hey, no worries. I'll let you keep your parking space.

114
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,450
我会让你留着你的停车位

115
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,520
你可以用
You can have it.

116
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,780
你还需要我的残疾人授勋仪式
You'll also need my handicapped placard.

117
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,120
俯身过来
Bend over.

118
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,730
好了，你的论点够明确的了
Well, you make a pretty convincing argument.

119
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,130
小蔡杀了那女人 现在福满又负责了？
Chase killed that woman. Now Foreman's in charge?

120
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,120
对，我们是论资排辈的
Yeah, we have a pecking order here.

121
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,780
如果卡麦伦杀了什么人 就又轮到小蔡了
If Cameron kills somebody, Chase takes over. There's a flow chart in the lobby.

122
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,590
大厅里有流程表

123
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,340
在接下了的3周里 你直接向福满医生报告
For the next three weeks, you answer directly to Dr. Foreman.

124
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,070
而我希望你能9点来参加查房
And I expect you here for grand rounds at 9:00.

125
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,220
顺便提...
By the way... I like sugar in my coffee.

126
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,740
我的咖啡里喜欢加糖

127
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:28,760
如果不灵光，那是你的不灵光
If there's a screw-up, it's your screw-up.

128
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,000
你别指望豪斯医生给你兜底
You won't have Dr. House to fall back on.

129
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,390
"你系安全带了么?"
<i>"Do you wear a seat belt?"</i>

130
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,150
- 那真的跟抽搐有关么? - 跳
Is that really relevant to a seizure?

131
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,840
“你接种过牛痘么？” 这问题怎么样？
Skip it.

132
00:05:41,326 --> 00:05:42,344
How about, um...

133
00:05:42,428 --> 00:05:43,959
<i>"Were you vaccinated for polio?"</i>

134
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,540
我觉得你是为了得到fdr才给我表格的
I think you gave me the form intended for FDR.

135
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,570
你真喜欢第5名的那个小莫么?
You really like Teeny Tiny Mo in the 5th?

136
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:51,080
我昨天赌中了6局中的4
I went 4 for 6 yesterday.

137
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,960
你想赢，先把我治好
You want winners, cure me first.

138
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,490
"你对你的人生大体上还满意么?"
<i>"Are you generally satisfied with your life?"</i>

139
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,520
才没问那样的问题呢
It does not ask that.

140
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:09,420
你知道，我其实正打算问一位有名望的 医生在场外赌马大厅干嘛？
You know, I was going to ask

141
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,472
what a respectable doctor was doing in an OTB parlor.

142
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,360
可不知怎么，那个问题不重要了
Somehow that question doesn't seem relevant anymore.

143
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:13,500
你的借口呢?
- What's your excuse? - Turns me on.

144
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,850
让我兴奋莫名
Yeah? What else turns you on?

145
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:16,750
是么？还有什么让你兴奋莫名的？

146
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,080
药品?
Drugs?

147
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,380
不经意的性生活?
Casual sex?

148
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,210
粗野的性生活?
Rough sex?

149
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,780
不经意的粗野的性生活?
Casual rough sex?

150
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,220
我是医生，我需要知道
I'm a doctor. I need to know.

151
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,090
没性生活，刚搬来的
No sex.

152
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,620
甚至都还没找到工作呢 谁都不认识
Just moved here.

153
00:06:28,312 --> 00:06:30,642
Haven't even found a job yet. Don't know anybody.

154
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,750
没工作就跑这来？
Came here without a job.

155
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,050
那意思是你并不是搬到这来
That means you didn't move here.

156
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,610
你是从什么地方逃走到这的
You moved away from somewhere else.

157
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:37,962
Whew.

158
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,250
- 疼么? - 不
- Does that hurt? - No.

159
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,460
在吃出处方药么？ 荷尔蒙？强的松？
You on prescription meds? Hormones? Prednisone?

160
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,850
我已经回答过那个问题了
I already answered that one. I think it was question number 20-something.

161
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,810
我想是第20号问题什么的

162
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,630
对，我可以一伸手就拿到
Yeah, and I could reach down and get it,

163
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,820
可那不就破坏我的整体酷形象了么？
but that would kind of spoil the whole cool move.

164
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,600
我没吃什么药
I'm not on any medications.

165
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:55,680
你吃素么?
- You vegetarian? - No. Why?

166
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,780
不是，为什么问？

167
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,310
因为你可能得了所谓库辛综合症
Because you might have something called Cushing's Syndrome.

168
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,230
那意思是……
Which basically means...

169
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,060
我的垂体分泌过量促肾上腺皮质激素
My pituitary is overproducing ACTH,

170
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,020
导致我的肾上腺
which is causing my adrenal glands

171
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,940
向我的血流中推进过多皮质醇
to push too much cortisol into my bloodstream.

172
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,510
很巧合，我也是个医生
By coincidence,

173
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,320
我从去年患上的
I'm a doctor too.

174
00:07:12,816 --> 00:07:14,319
Yeah, I had it last year.

175
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,910
他们动了脑科手术
They did brain surgery.

176
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:19,170
从我的垂体里移除了一个腺瘤
Removed an adenoma from my pituitary.

177
00:07:23,663 --> 00:07:28,830
[Whistles a tune]

178
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:30,530
嗯?
Huh?

179
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,250
你刚才说什么?
What did you just say?

180
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:35,160
"你是对的，豪斯，她的腺体瘤又长了
"You were right, House, her pituitary tumor regrew.

181
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,720
是库辛症，你真神了"
It is Cushing's. Uncanny how you do that."

182
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,690
其实，那是卡麦伦的主意
Actually, it was Cameron's idea.

183
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,490
不，卡麦伦有过3个主意
No, Cameron had three ideas.

184
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,320
我选了其一进行鼓励和培养
I chose one to encourage, to nurture.

185
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,130
没错，你就是养分
Yeah, you're all about the nurturing.

186
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,870
你需要拥抱么?
Do you need a hug?

187
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,260
我没看到又长的痕迹
I don't see any regrowth.

188
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,380
你拿到她医疗记录的传真了么?
You get a medical records fax over?

189
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,380
聪明的工作，不是勤奋的工作 那是我的哲学，老板
Work smart, not hard. That's my philosophy, boss.

190
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,520
我当你说没拿
I'll take that as a no.

191
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,620
安尼卡，我需要你纹丝不动
Foreman: <i>Anica, I need you to stay completely still.</i>

192
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,550
对不起
Sorry.

193
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,920
还是什么都没看到
Still don't see anything.

194
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,930
好，那就是微型瘤，肉眼看不到
Okay, so it's a micro adenoma, too small to see.

195
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,520
微型到根本不在那的程度
It's so small, it's not even there.

196
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,430
对，我能预言她在一年前
Right, it's just a coincidence that I predicted a rare condition that shehappened to have a year ago.

197
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,990
发生稀有症状完全是出于偶然

198
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,370
她的LP检查结果出来了么?
Results from her LP back yet?

199
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,270
没做LP，我知道她怎么回事
Didn't do an LP. I knew what she had.

200
00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:25,664
Window Closed [control panel: open_winMRI-1]

201
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,240
去做LP
Go do the LP.

202
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,870
好，我需要你向一侧翻身
Okay, I need you to roll over on your side, kiss your kneecaps.

203
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,730
吻你的膝盖

204
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,630
舞会时间到
Party time.

205
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,950
－我以为只需要一位医生做这个 －我来观察
I thought it only took one doctor to do this. I'm observing.

206
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,060
她到这来是要保证我不把你搞瘫痪
She's here to make sure I don't paralyze you.

207
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,870
以前你做过这个，对吧?
You've done this before, right?

208
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:48,930
成功的么?
Successfully?

209
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,850
他在开玩笑，他是个超凡的医生
He's kidding. He's an excellent doctor.

210
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,670
我要用利多卡因使你局部麻醉
House: I'm gonna numb the area with some lidocaine.

211
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,290
然后我们就结束比赛了
And then we're off to the races. See what I did there?

212
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,570
看我在那是怎么干的了么?
I used horse racing jargon to make the patient feel more comfortable.

213
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:00,590
我用赌马的行话使病人感觉更舒适

214
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,230
好，来吧
Okay, here we go.

215
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,750
感觉上是骨头，那样疼么?
[Gasps] Ow!

216
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:06,900
Felt like bone. Does that hurt?

217
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,250
一点点，你干嘛呢？ 嗷！
A little bit. What are you doing? Oww!

218
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,990
试试把背往后一点
Try running your back a bit more.

219
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,860
现在这样就挺好
Perfect is the way you are.

220
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,690
哦，都赖我
- [Gasps] - Oops. That was all me.

221
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,580
该向下挪一节椎骨
Ow!

222
00:09:16,846 --> 00:09:18,432
Might wanna move down one vertebrae.

223
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,870
这比我记忆中难多了
This is actually much harder than I remember.

224
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,820
哦!
[Gasps] Ohh!

225
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,660
我的胸部有压迫感
My chest feels a little tight.

226
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,300
深呼吸
Try taking a deep breath.

227
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,850
豪斯医生，还是由我来接手吧
Dr. House, maybe I should take it from here.

228
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,210
第8次是魔法次数
Eighth time's the charm.

229
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,540
啊!
Aah!

230
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,380
你想惹福满生气么?
You trying to piss off Foreman?

231
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,930
让……
[Monitor stars beeping] Let...

232
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,460
血压是240比140
Cameron: EP's 240 over 140.

233
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,010
把那个东西关了，好么?
Turn that thing off, will you?

234
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,570
把针拔出来
Take the needle out.

235
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,820
- 把针拔出来 - 好吧
- Take the needle out! - Okay!

236
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,430
是高血压临界点
It's a hypertensive crisis. Start her on an IV Lopressor drip.

237
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,630
给她挂水

238
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:50,010
滴速不高于140，她会没事的
Titrate to systolic less than 140. She'll be fine.

239
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,210
卡麦伦，到我办公室来
House: Cameron, meet me in my office.

240
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,970
探通术既冒险又多余...
House: At the risk of sounding redundant...

241
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,100
而且，没错...
and right...again...

242
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,020
她有库欣症
she has Cushing's.

243
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,280
库欣症
Cushing's.

244
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,760
对，也就是说 你扰乱了她的lp
Right...the fact that you mangled her LP has nothing to do with it?

245
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,860
是没有关联的?
Actually, it has everything to do with it.

246
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,860
实际上是完全有关联的

247
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:10,470
库欣症加上压力等于高血压临界点
Cushing's plus stress equals hypertensive crisis.

248
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,020
干的不错，送了个新手来
Smart move, sending the rookie.

249
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,560
她最初的症状可能由酗酒导致
Her initial symptoms could have been caused by alcohol-induced DIC.

250
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,110
她到达高血压临界点
She hada hypertensive crisis because it's been at least six hours since she hadher last drink.

251
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,410
是因为她已经6个小时没喝酒了

252
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:20,340
她在戒酒
She's detoxing.

253
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,480
就在我要给她做LP检查的时候么?
The exact same moment that I'm futilely trying to give her an LP?

254
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,590
没错，一个在垂体上肉眼 看不到的瘤倒更象真的
Right, an invisible tumor on her pituitary is much more likely.

255
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,320
如果瘤确实存在其他地方呢?
Chase: What if the tumor is somewhere else?

256
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,770
可能是在肺部或胰脏上长的 促肾上腺皮脂激素瘤
There could be an ACTH-secreting tumor on her lung or pancreas.

257
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,740
太罕见了
It's awfully rare.

258
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,610
那也比肉眼看不见多见
Not as rare as an invisible tumor.

259
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:38,110
他们干嘛不让你代替福满来负责呢?
Why didn't they put you in charge instead of Foreman?

260
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,990
哦，对，你是杀了那个女人的人
Oh, yeah, you're the guy that killed that woman.

261
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:45,280
在她死于皮质醇前做个平铺扫描吧
Get a pan-man scan before she dies of cortisol OD.

262
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,120
拜托?
[Whimpers] Please?

263
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,350
好，做吧
Fine, do it.

264
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:52,910
但如果找不到东西
But when you don't find anything,

265
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,480
就给她吃利眠宁
put her on a Librium taper for the withdrawal and get her a bed in a rehab clinic.

266
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,920
再找个诊所给她做康复好了

267
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,510
肺部正常
Chase: Lungs look clean.

268
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:13,400
她的淋巴结没有肿大
Her lymph node's not enlarged.

269
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,320
卡迪让福满负责这个部门
Cuddy tapped Foreman to run the department.

270
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,050
都没人问我
- I didn't even get asked. - Neither did I.

271
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,060
- 也没问我 - 你被停职了
- You were suspended. - I was kidding.

272
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,310
我开玩笑呢
It's the irony of women in charge. They don't like other women in charge.

273
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,050
是对女人当权的讥讽

274
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,450
他们就是不喜欢其他女人管事

275
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,350
怎么？你觉得是其他原因么？
Hmph!

276
00:11:27,534 --> 00:11:29,195
What? You think it's something else?

277
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,560
是你自己搞砸了
You sabotaged yourself.

278
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:35,080
你跟豪斯约会，又跟我睡觉
You went on a date with House. You slept with me.

279
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,360
让你负责这个部门
Putting you in charge of this department is like a sexual harassment suit waiting to happen.

280
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,590
就象是等待性骚扰案件发生一样

281
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,620
是啊，就象我真能 创造个敌对环境似的
Yeah. They're really worried that I'm gonna create a hostile work environment.

282
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,120
没准就是这个问题
Maybe that's the problem.

283
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,500
做主管就象对豪斯说不一样
Being in charge means having to say "no" to House.

284
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,550
你会那样做么?
Would you hire you for that?

285
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:57,420
安德森强势出场
[On TV] <i>Anderson coming out strong.</i>

286
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,500
他在想什么?
<i>What is he thinking? He watched what Tom Meents just did.</i>

287
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,330
他看到了汤母的作为

288
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,410
你让做的妇科整体核磁共振检查么?
You ordered MRIs for the entire maternity ward?

289
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,300
我当时状态癫狂
I was in a crazy mood.

290
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,390
还好我有个新老板来收拾烂摊子
Good thing I got a new boss to back me up.

291
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,570
尽管我觉得这中间有有用的东西
Although I think one of those is actually necessary.

292
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,080
在你都取消前还是梳理一下吧
Better comb through before you cancel them all.

293
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,970
豪斯，你到底想让我怎样?
What do you expect me to do, House?

294
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,020
放弃？哭？
Quit? Cry?

295
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,940
其实，我希望你能名副其职
Actually, I expect you to act like what you are.

296
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:27,300
我的雇员、我的属下
My employee. My subordinate.

297
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,680
我的婊子
My bitch.

298
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,180
对啊，既然你好意询问……
Yeah. Well, since you asked nicely--

299
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:35,620
上帝，我不能相信 我拉下了整年的离职摘要
God. I can't believe I got more than a year behind

300
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,140
得赶紧赶上来
on my discharge summaries. Gotta get caught up.

301
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,160
哦，不，等等
Oh, no. Wait.

302
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,130
我已经没有授权签这些东西了
I'm not authorized to sign these anymore. Only you are.

303
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,510
但你能

304
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:45,690
放马过来吧，我不会崩溃的
Keep it coming. I'm not gonna break.

305
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,840
扫描显示她的胰脏有问题
Scan showed a mass on her pancreas.

306
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:53,230
看上去是恶性的，可能不宜动手术
It looks malignant. Probably inoperable.

307
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,070
我看至多挺两个月
I'd give her two months.

308
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:04,190
从好的方面看，我是对的
[Sighs]

309
00:13:00,058 --> 00:13:03,820
On the bright side, it still means I was right.

310
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,920
豪斯医生在哪?
Where's Dr. House?

311
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,290
福满医生接手了你的病例
Dr. Foreman's overseeing your case.

312
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,840
他认为我跟你说比较恰当
He thought it'd be best if I spoke with you.

313
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:19,580
我们在你的胰脏发现了一个肿块
We found a mass in your pancreas.

314
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,920
象癌症
It looks like cancer.

315
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,530
也就是说胰脏的东西导致我抽搐?
So something in my pancreas caused me to have a seizure?

316
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,180
或许
Probably. But the bigger point is...

317
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,510
但更重要的问题是...

318
00:13:31,468 --> 00:13:37,299
[Inhales deeply and exhales] A one year survival rate for pancreatic cancer is less than 20%.

319
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:37,010
胰脏癌症成活超过 一年的病例不足两成

320
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,050
那治疗方案呢?
So what's the treatment?

321
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:44,760
我们要对肿块进行活检以验明正身
We need to biopsy the mass to see what we're dealing with. And...

322
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,730
然后...

323
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:51,040
我们会提供选择
Then we can recommend options from there.

324
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,120
听起来不错
Sounds good.

325
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,580
活检需要得到你的同意
I need your consent to do the biopsy.

326
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:09,660
谢谢，祝我好运吧
Thanks.

327
00:14:07,754 --> 00:14:09,382
Wish me luck.

328
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,580
祝你好运
Good luck.

329
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:16,730
奇怪，她好像根本没反应似的
Cameron: It was weird. She barely reacted at all.

330
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,270
我会希望人们拥抱我
I've had people hug me

331
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,110
摇摇我
and people take a swing at me.

332
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,370
这有点象她没听见我说话似的
This was more like she didn't even hear me.

333
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,760
放大三倍
Magnify three times.

334
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,480
豪斯援助
House assisting. That is funny.

335
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,240
真有趣

336
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,570
福满要死了真遗憾
Too bad Foreman's gonna die.

337
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,720
下午好
Good afternoon.

338
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,940
我是豪斯医生，我要看你的……
I'm Dr. House.

339
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:52,907
I'm going to be looking at your...

340
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,910
太好了
Perfect.

341
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,910
请原谅
Excuse me.

342
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,290
我需要福满医生在1号诊疗室督导
I need Dr. Foreman in Exam Room One for a consult.

343
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,120
什么时候开始的?
So, when did this start?

344
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,520
几周前
A couple weeks ago.

345
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,200
我不想怀孕
I didn't want to get pregnant.

346
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,340
杰不愿带避孕套 我就用了避孕胶
Jake's not into rubbers, so I got on the jelly.

347
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,170
你看我是不是过敏还是什么?
You think I'm allergic or something?

348
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,430
你感染了，需要样品
You have an infection. Gonna need a sample.

349
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,970
我带瓶子来了
I brought the jar.

350
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,400
不，我的意思是你的……
No, I meant a sample of your...

351
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,780
好，我们有个神经学问题……
Okay. We have a neurological problem here.

352
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,670
我的脑子有问题么?
There's something wrong with my brain?

353
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,410
哦，对
Oh, yeah.

354
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:43,440
你穿上吧，我得到需要的了
You can cover yourself up. I got what I need.

355
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,300
怎么了?
What's up?

356
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,380
闻闻
Smell this.

357
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,950
闻起来象阴道
[Sniffs] Smells like vaginosis.

358
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,470
但其实并不是我叫的
But it's not really my call.

359
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,350
太好了，我会记得在你的名字后面 加个金质的星星
Great. I'll be sure to put a gold star by your name on the board.

360
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,180
安妮卡的胰脏癌症活检
Anica's biopsy for pancreatic cancer

361
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,320
是阴性的
was negative.

362
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,440
好，我给你点抗生素
Okay. I'm gonna give you some antibiotics

363
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,170
你要一阵子别过性生活了
and you probably shouldn't have sex for a while.

364
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,420
多久？
How long?

365
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,840
以进化论的基础来说，我认为永远
On an evolutionary basis, I'd recommend forever.

366
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,400
胰脏肿块是良性的
The mass in the pancreas is benign.

367
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,030
可能只是个疤痕组织
It's probably just scar tissue.

368
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,000
好消息，她没病
Good news. She's not sick all. Other than being an alcoholic.

369
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,310
不过是个酒鬼而已
The labs you sent yesterday put her ACTH at 64 pico-grams per milliliter.

370
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,830
昨天你送检的东西

371
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,130
使她分泌64毫克促肾上腺皮质激素

372
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,450
她发库欣症，有事引发了症状
She's got Cushing's. Something set it off.

373
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,160
该是大脑
It's gotta be in her brain.

374
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,400
给她做个静脉取样
Set her up for a venous sampling.

375
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:37,640
还有另一个可能性
There is another possibility.

376
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,400
小蔡，等等
Chase, hold on.

377
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,270
你怎么能把他训练的这么快的?
How'd you get him trained so fast?

378
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,660
电领子？口袋里有零食么？
Electronic collar?

379
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:46,730
胰脏活检的报告她都没读
Got treats in your pocket?

380
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,887
She didn't even read the consent form for the pancreatic biopsy.

381
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,740
谁读啊?
Who reads those things?

382
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,730
她不读，也许是因为她知道
Maybe she didn't read it because she KNEW that there was nothing wrong with her.

383
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,120
自己根本就没病

384
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,010
库欣症还有其他解释
There is another explanation for the Cushing's. Maybe she injected herself with the ACTH.

385
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:55,340
或许是她自己注射的激素

386
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,270
她的举止很象妄想症
Her behavior suggests Munchausen's.

387
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,960
过去的4个月里她有4次入院记录
She's had four hospitalizations in the last four months.

388
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:04,560
哦，很多入院治疗的记录对你来说 就是没事找事
Well, being hospitalized a lot certainly points to nothing being wrong with you.

389
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,230
她自打入院后就没有任何症状
She's had zero symptoms since she got here.

390
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,970
她的胰脏伤痕累累
The scarring on her pancreas could be be caused from injecting herself with the benzene and setting offthe seizures.

391
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,790
说明她注射苯而导致抽搐

392
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,700
她做过脑外科手术
House: She's had brain surgery.

393
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:16,130
你可以装胃疼 但无法装出脑部肿瘤
You can fake a stomach ache. You can't fake a brain tumor.

394
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,490
但可以装出个肉眼看不见的来
You can fake an invisible one.

395
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,230
我们该查她的住所找药品和耳咽管
We should check her apartment. Look for medications, syringes.

396
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,460
- 静脉取样更容易 - 也更危险
- Venous sampling's easier. - And more dangerous.

397
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:26,860
比非法闯入好点吧
Not if you get caught breaking in.

398
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:30,520
那就别被抓，豪斯
So don't get caught, House.

399
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,720
你觉得卡迪为什么挑福满不挑我?
Why do you think Cuddy picked Foreman over me?

400
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,530
是不是我做错了什么 或需要改进什么
If I done something wrong or if there's something I needed to improve on...

401
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:36,500
如果我告诉你她想要黑人
Would it make you shut up if I told you she wanted someone black?

402
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:37,960
是不是可以让你住嘴?

403
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,550
你怎么评价我的领导才能?
How would you describe my leadership skills?

404
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,880
不存在，或很好
Nonexistent. Otherwise excellent.

405
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,740
当领导总比当傻子强吧
There's more to being a leader than being a jerk.

406
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:48,110
无人知晓
The world will never know.

407
00:17:49,817 --> 00:17:51,891
[Starts engine]

408
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,860
不，没门，刚下完雪
No. No way.

409
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,090
昨天，路挺好
- It just snowed. - Yesterday.

410
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:56,972
The streets are clear.

411
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,350
我的车在那
My car is right there.

412
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,940
榆树街有路障
There's construction on Elm. Bike'll be faster.

413
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,830
摩托车快些
[Guns the motor]

414
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:27,000
浴室里都有书
Cameron: There's even books in the bathroom.

415
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,450
要么她就很聪明
Well, either she's very smart or she has a severe fiber deficiency.

416
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,850
要么就是纤维缺乏

417
00:18:32,023 --> 00:18:36,555
"Tuesday 1 pm Opthalmologist,  Dr. Peterson" "Thursday 10 am Gynecologist, Dr. Lachowicz"

418
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,400
她跟她的眼科医生在周二有约
She's got an appointment with her ophthalmologist on Tuesday

419
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:43,170
周4和妇科医生有约
and an appointment with her gynecologist on Thursday.

420
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,190
同时跟多个医生有约
Multiple appointments with multiple doctors.

421
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,100
妄想症症状
Symptom of Munchausen's.

422
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:51,670
或者跳出束缚思考
Or, just thinking outside the box here, she has a vagina and trouble reading.

423
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:55,130
她有个阴道同时阅读有困难

424
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,780
这有3副阅读眼睛 是不同配方的
There's three pairs of reading glasses. Each with different prescriptions.

425
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,570
正可以解释脑瘤压迫视觉神经
Which would be explained by a tumor pressing on the optic nerve.

426
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,440
因为你在为她得癌找佐证
Because you're looking for her to have a tumor.

427
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,510
而你在找...
And you are looking for...

428
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,710
妄想症的佐证
A person with Munchausen's Syndrome

429
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:11,600
喝电池酸并不需要 他们去眼科医生那里去扩瞳
drinks battery acid. They don't go to an ophthalmologist to get their pupils dilated.

430
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,180
眼科医生也是医生
An ophthalmologist is a doctor. Attention is attention.

431
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,940
注意力是注意力

432
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:17,030
你联系了几家医院?
How many hospitals have you contacted?

433
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,810
有任何一位医生说她疯了么？ 她不是妄想症
Has one doctor said she's crazy? It's not Munchausen's.

434
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,010
不是你的期待
It's not your call.

435
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,890
如果你觉得她有妄想症
If you think she's got Munchausen's, then obviously you got something to show the man.

436
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,110
那你该有明显的事实给他

437
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,570
一个灌洗器，一瓶激素
A syringe in her apartment. A bottle of ACTH.

438
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,660
妄想症的病人很善于隐藏他们的行踪
Munchausen patients are good at covering their tracks.

439
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,520
哦，对啊，所以我们什么都没找到
Oh, right. So the fact that we found nothing

440
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:35,380
倒能证明问题了
proves there's something.

441
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:38,300
看看芝加哥她的医生们的报告啊
Look at the pathology reports from the surgery she had in Chicago.

442
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,200
他们切除了她30％的垂体
They removed 30% of her pituitary.

443
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,190
他们没发现瘤
They found no tumor.

444
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,960
可能是医生没找到
It's possible the surgeons just missed it.

445
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,120
我的意思是那种手术 切开然后希望
I mean that kind of surgery. You're just cutting and hoping.

446
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,160
当然，我们都对
Of course! We're both right. Excellent solution. Everybody's happy.

447
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,580
完美的结论，大家都高兴

448
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,570
拜托，提高点，福满
Come on. Step up, Foreman.

449
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:54,150
如果你觉得我对 让我往病人脑袋里插针
If you think I'm right, order me to stick a needle in her brain.

450
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,590
如果你觉得卡麦伦对 送病人回家
If you think Cameron's right, send the patient home.

451
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,870
她要么死，要么活
Either she'll be fine, or she'll die.

452
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:02,970
征求她的意见，做静脉取样
Do the venous sampling. Get her consent.

453
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:12,010
干的不错，老板 可以保住你的屁股了
Nice move, boss. Way to cover your ass.

454
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,400
我只是赞同你罢了
I just agreed with you.

455
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:14,980
并不是你觉得我对
Not because you think I'm right.

456
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,950
你只是选择了安全通道
You're just taking the safe route.

457
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,670
你是软脚虾
You're a wuss.

458
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:22,090
别担心，我会守口如瓶的
Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.

459
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:28,250
嘿，威尔森 猜刚才福满干了什么?
House: Hey, Wilson! Guess what Foreman just did?

460
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,320
嗨
Hi.

461
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:40,770
这是往你脑子里放置导管的同意书
This is a consent form to stick a wire into your brain.

462
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,780
对医院来说这是很重要的程序
It's important for hospitals to get these signed for procedures that are completely unnecessary.

463
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:45,290
但其实根本没必要

464
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,240
那你干嘛还做?
Then why are you doing it?

465
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,550
因为你精神有问题
Because you're mentally ill.

466
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,190
你为吸引医生注意给自己
You injected yourself with ACTH to induce Cushing's to get attention doctors.

467
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,190
注射激素导致抽搐

468
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,280
到目前为止有效
And so far it's worked.

469
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,830
我要见其他医生
I'd like to see another doctor.

470
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,250
我没给你要的东西么?
I'm not giving you what you want?

471
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,820
我不要个婊子
I don't want a bitch.

472
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,730
签了这个表格，我就走
Just sign the forms, okay, and I'll get out of here.

473
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,970
希望无论你给自己注射什么
Hopefully for you, what ever you injected yourself with won't wear off

474
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,650
在一个真正关心你的医生
before you get fun of a caring and concerned doctor cutting into your head.

475
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,900
打开你的脑袋前别用光了

476
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:30,420
你选我让豪斯感觉悲惨是吧？
You chose me to make House miserable, didn't you?

477
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,860
很明显他让你觉得很悲惨
Apparently he's making YOU miserable.

478
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,460
真感人
That's impressive.

479
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,800
另请高明吧
Find someone else.

480
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,900
不，6年了，我头一次可以拿到
No.

481
00:21:37,423 --> 00:21:42,111
For the first time in six years I'm getting copied on all experimental tests and procedures.

482
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,060
试验单副本和所有程序副本

483
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,160
问诊时间充足
Clinic hours have been logged and completed.

484
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,400
在豪斯听政前你给了我4个月
You've given me four months of House's dictations

485
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,750
使我可以找保险公司算账
so I can finally bill insurance companies.

486
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,080
而我只证明了豪斯可以让我很悲惨
I only did that stuff to prove he couldn't make me miserable.

487
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,730
干的不错
Well, way to go.

488
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,380
现在所有人都得其所哉了 连豪斯也是
Now everybody's getting what they need. Even House.

489
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,920
他可以扮演科学狂人 这个部门运转顺畅
He gets to play mad scientist, and this department runs smoothly.

490
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,890
而我在接下来的3个星期 还得继续卡在那么
So I'm stuck with this for the next three weeks.

491
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,090
没准更长呢
Maybe longer.

492
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:11,500
如果这一切不是假装你会有兴趣么?
Would you be interested if this wasn't just pretend?

493
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,300
妈妈怎么说?
What did Mommy say?

494
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,860
我袜子里没有糖果
I don't get any candy in my stocking.

495
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,710
病人准备做静脉取样么?
Patient being prepped for the venous sampling?

496
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,560
对
Yeah.

497
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,190
精神有问题的病人正准备 进行一个无意义的程序
Mentally ill patient is right on track for a pointless procedure.

498
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:23,380
好，我们知道你的异议了
Yeah, we get your objection. [Phone starts ringing]

499
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,100
福满
Foreman.

500
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,710
你肯定吗?
Are you sure?

501
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,590
那没理由，再查一下
That doesn't make any sense. Check it again.

502
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:39,070
我们得暂停取样检查了
Haw! We gotta delay the venous sampling.

503
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:42,830
为什么？ 她的尿变橙色了么？
Why? Her urine turning orange?

504
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,590
你怎会知道?
How would you know that?

505
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,380
因为那是利福平的功效
Because that's what rifampin does.

506
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,040
她并没用抗生素?
She's not on antibiotics?

507
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:52,930
但如果一个妄想症病人 发觉她的把戏要被揭穿了
But if a Munchausen's patient thinks she's about get busted,

508
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:57,080
她看到一个标着“危险”字样 的药瓶就会拿几片
she sees pills labeled "Dangerous: might cause seizures," she might grab a couple.

509
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,470
而如果那个贴标签的 瓶子碰巧是抗生素
And if that label were accidentally on a bottle of antibiotics

510
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,870
而那个瓶子又碰巧是放在了她屋里...
and if that bottle were accidentally left in her room...

511
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,020
- 你陷害她? - 没准
- You set her up? - Might have.

512
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,690
是妄想症
It's Munchausen's.

513
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,190
这些都是她自找
All this she did to herself.

514
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,230
我不知道你到底说什么
I don't  what the hell you're talking about.

515
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,920
我抽筋了
I had a seizure. I'm sick. I need your help.

516
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,830
我病了，我需要你的帮助

517
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,580
不是这个科
Not from this department.

518
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,370
利福平半衰期3个小时
The half-life of rifampin is three hours. After that, you'll get your psych referral

519
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,340
然后会推荐你精神科医生

520
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,660
和你的账单
and your discharge papers.

521
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,790
你知道，不因为你把手指插到喉咙里
You know, just because you stick your fingers down your throat

522
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,160
我们大家都被你搞了
doesn't mean the rest of us are screwed up.

523
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,320
我看当合作失败后 你就会变得敌意了
I guess when cooperation fails, you move onto hostility.

524
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,850
我不是蓄意这样做的
I didn't do this to myself.

525
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,670
100% 承诺
Chase: 100% commitment.

526
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,080
由说谎的人签署
Sign of a good liar.

527
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,010
也是反社会的人签署的
[Scoffs] Also the sign of a sociopath.

528
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,270
你在干嘛?
What are you doing?

529
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:12,420
改正你最后一个笔记
Correcting your last note.

530
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,990
我们不能放走她，她有病
We can't discharge her, she's sick.

531
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:17,440
有人告诉你你笔迹象姑娘么？
Anybody ever tell you you write like a girl?

532
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,430
什么?
What?

533
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,720
你对橙色尿液有其他解释么?
You got some other explanation for orange urine?

534
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:23,030
- 是妄想症 - 对，但不完全
- It's Munchausen's. - Correct, but not complete.

535
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,410
你就是无法承认她使你惨败的事实
You just don't wanna admit that she skunked you.

536
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,870
叫“狼来了”的孩子
At the end of "The Boy Who Cried Wolf"

537
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,030
结果是狼真的来了
the wolf really does come.

538
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,690
他吃了孩子、羊还有孩子的父母
And he eats the sheep and the boy and his parents.

539
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:33,920
羊没吃父母
- The wolf doesn't eat the parents. - It does when I tell it.

540
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,430
- 我讲的时候就吃了 - 现在不由你讲故事，我在讲
You're not telling the story now. I am.

541
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,480
看，我查了她的记录
Look, I checked her records.

542
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,800
她所有的住院记录所为理由不同
All her hospitalizations were for different things.

543
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:45,770
脑瘤、昏厥、皮疹、抽搐
Brain tumor, fainting spells, skin rashes, seizures.

544
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,610
她的验血记录到处都是
She's had every blood test known to man and the results were all over the map.

545
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:51,710
结果只有一个：低ACT
There's only one constant. Low HCT.

546
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,010
贫血是真的
The anemia's real.

547
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,260
能导致那个症状的药品 她能吃到的多了
There's a million things she could have taken to have done that.

548
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,950
对，也可能根本就是月经闹的
True. Could just be her M.O.

549
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:00,200
她自找了两种病，一种老变 另一种从来不变
She self-induces two illnesses. One always changes, one never does.

550
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,710
又或许她得了妄想症和 再生障碍型贫血
Or maybe, she has Munchausen's and aplastic anemia.

551
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,860
也就是说，没有适当的治疗
Which would mean without the proper treatment, she'll continue to get sicker, weaker,

552
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:09,660
她会变得越来越虚弱、严重 之至内出血而死
eventually she'll start bleeding internally and die.

553
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,810
- 她不会变得更重 - 她会的
- She's not getting sicker. - She will.

554
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:15,040
如果她的骨髓在衰亡 那整个血液系统都会出问题的
If her bone marrow was dying, the entire blood panel would be affected.

555
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,910
- 她的白血球读数正常 - 目前而言
- Her white count's normal. - So far.

556
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,300
我们要做骨髓活检
We need to do a bone marrow biopsy.

557
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,080
- 不，不做检查了 - 你看
- No. No more tests. - Look.

558
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:22,430
你看，如果你用妄想症把她 踢到一边
You kick her to the curb with a Munchausen's diagnosis,

559
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,070
今后保证再也没有 医生会相信她的话了
you're guaranteeing that no doctor will ever listen to her again.

560
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,850
我们做再多的检查也只是喂养了 她的精神而已
We do more tests, we'll only be feeding her psychosis.

561
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,580
我们给予她越多注意，她就越贪婪
The more attention we give her, the more she'll want.

562
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:34,570
如果她不知道我们在检查她如何?
What if she doesn't know we're testing her?

563
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:37,200
豪斯，你错了 认命吧
House. You were wrong. Live with it.

564
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,790
早前的检查还剩下些血液
There's probably some blood left over from previous tests.

565
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:42,240
只验血无法证实再生障碍性贫血
Blood tests alone can't confirm aplastic anemia.

566
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:45,490
对，我知道，所以才要做骨髓活检
Yes, I know. That's why I wanna do a bone marrow biopsy.

567
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:49,090
血液检查可以显示系统疾病 或滤过病毒或毒素的成因
The blood tests could show a systemic disease, or a virus or toxin that could be the cause.

568
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:52,050
好，你想要多查点血么？ 把你自己敲晕吧
Fine. You wanna test the extra blood? Knock yourself out.

569
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,980
但病人已经超限了
But the patient is off-limits.

570
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,840
如果结果是阳性的……
And if the results are positive...

571
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:58,090
我可以活检么?
I get my biopsy?

572
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,430
是条安全的路
It's a safe way to go.

573
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:21,100
我需要做所有检查和PCR
I need all of these tests and a PCR done on this sample.

574
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:23,230
只能用这些样品

575
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:25,060
需要更多血
You're gonna need more blood.

576
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,390
病人没血了
Patient's empty.

577
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,480
那我就不能做
Then I can't do it.

578
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,920
- 你可以试试 - 我还想试试做名模呢
You can try.

579
00:26:30,867 --> 00:26:33,085
You can try to look like Salma Hayek.

580
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,880
可那是不会发生的
It's not gonna make it happen.

581
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,950
你或许没有名模的屁股
You may not have Salma's ass, but she doesn't have your eyes.

582
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,700
可她没有你的眼睛啊

583
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,750
对，是啊
Yeah, right.

584
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,800
你多久要?
How soon do you need it?

585
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:57,790
韦森大夫，我能私下跟你谈谈么?
[Knocking on door]

586
00:26:55,471 --> 00:26:57,932
Dr. Wilson. Can I talk to you about something in confidence?

587
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:58,940
当然
Of course.

588
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,250
- 关于豪斯 - 哦，那算了
- It's about House. - Oh. Then no.

589
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:02,790
好吧
Fine.

590
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:05,240
我什么都不说
I won't say anything.

591
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,220
你认为豪斯有可能把我
Do you think there's any way

592
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,250
当成他的真老板么?
House would take me seriously as his boss?

593
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:14,020
哦，这是从何而来啊?
Uh...where is this coming from?

594
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,680
卡迪没说什么么?
Did Cuddy say something?

595
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:18,120
我们谈了，她提的
We talked. She intimated.

596
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,340
而你征求我的意见去篡他的权?
And you want my advice on how to usurp him?

597
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,510
在远古你需要袍儿、
It's very ancient Rome. He'll need a toga, of course. A...

598
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,700
剑……
sword.

599
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:29,510
不是政变，是找到与他共存的方法
It's not a coup.

600
00:27:26,939 --> 00:27:29,393
I just wanna figure out some way we can work together.

601
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,390
我的意思是从管理角度我运作团队
I mean, I keep the team running from an administrative point of view.

602
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,100
豪斯无需应付红胶带
House doesn't have to deal with the red tape.

603
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:36,920
- 双赢 - 我肯定他也那么看
- It's a win-win. - I'm sure he'll see it that way.

604
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,810
你对于接近他,
You have any advice on how to approach him,

605
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,300
应付他有任何建议么?
- how to deal with the guy? - No.

606
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:42,690
没有

607
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,310
但你不会告诉他我们谈过是吧?
But you won't tell him we talked?

608
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,150
不会
No.

609
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:56,380
根本没门这会发生的
There is no way this is gonna happen.

610
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,240
哦，他多么甜蜜
[Singing The Beatles' "Aint She Sweet"] <i># Oh, ain't he sweet #</i>

611
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,800
看他走在大街上
<i># See him walkin' down that street #</i>

612
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:09,980
所以我充满信心的问
<i># So I ask you very confidentially #</i>

613
00:28:07,646 --> 00:28:09,742
<i># Ain't he sweet #</i>

614
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,390
艾泼指数到顶了
Epstein-Barr titers are through the roof.

615
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,100
最普通的病毒导致了再障贫血
Most common viral cause of aplastic anemia.

616
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,960
我说的是...
So what I'm saying is...

617
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,470
只向目标望一眼
<i># Just cast an eye in his direction #</i>

618
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:27,420
哦，我，我的天，多专业
<i># Oh me, oh my, ain't that perfection #</i>

619
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:29,270
胎儿血红蛋白也提高了
Fetal hemoglobin's also elevated.

620
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,280
对，一点点，可能……
Yeah, just a wee bit.

621
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,790
哦，可以在镰状细胞中看出来
- Could indicate... - Uh, you see that in Sickle Cell.

622
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:34,820
不是所有的镰状细胞病人是黑人
Not all Sickle Cell patients are black.

623
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,630
她其他的血样并未显示镰状细胞
None of her other blood panels showed any sign of Sickle Cell.

624
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,360
也就是说昨天发生了什么突变
Which means either something's changed drastically since yesterday,

625
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:42,770
或者这不是她的血液
- or this isn't her blood. - Oh course it is!

626
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,940
当然是

627
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,430
比喻性的
Metaphorically.

628
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,810
看，我不能再做检查了
Look, I couldn't do the tests.

629
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,060
我试了，但血液不够
I tried, and there wasn't enough blood left over.

630
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,390
你就让我做活检吧
You just let me do the biopsy.

631
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,920
没门，我刚复职
Chase: No way.

632
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,128
I just got back from a suspension.

633
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,270
如果不是我，你就被炒了
And if it wasn't for me, you would have been fired.

634
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,900
你干嘛不自己去搞样品?
Why don't you just get the sample yourself?

635
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,810
从几时起你开始在乎老板说的话了?
Since when have you cared what your boss said?

636
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,350
我不在乎他们说什么 我在乎他们做什么
I don't care what anybody says, I care what they do.

637
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,390
现在，需要黑白分明
And right now, Blackpoleon Blackaparte has got the nurses on red alert.

638
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:15,890
他们给护士发了红色警报 不允许我接近病人
I can't get into the patient's room.

639
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:17,960
所以，来吧，我吸引敌人的火力
So come on. I'll draw the enemy fire,

640
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,570
你走侧翼，进去搞到骨髓样品
you outflank them, get in there, get the bone marrow sample.

641
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:22,050
不能
Can't.

642
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:25,020
你更怕谁?
Who are you more afraid of?

643
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,820
我不怕福满，我跟他意见相同
I'm not afraid of Foreman. I agree with him. All the tests back him up.

644
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,200
所有检查都支持他
All the tests have not been done.

645
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,510
并没完成所有检查

646
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,870
你该知道那黑家伙的统治是暂时的吧
You do realize that Blackaparte's reign is only temporary.

647
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,860
我也知道无论我怎么做
I also realize that no matter what I do, you're still gonna treat me like crap.

648
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,440
你都还是会象对待废物一样的对待我

649
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,220
废物是相对的
Crap is a relative term.

650
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,250
我甚至没能进她的房间
I never even made it into the room.

651
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:59,440
才要了一个套针管护士就叫了主治医
Nurses called the attending as soon as a Trocar was ordered.

652
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,750
你用了她的真名?
You used her real name?

653
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,580
我刚签了你病人的账单
I just processed your patient's discharge papers.

654
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:06,580
她正要出院
She's on her way out right now.

655
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,370
哎
Whoa! Whoa. Whoa.

656
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,160
等等
Wait up.

657
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,170
没事了，她要留下
It's all right. She's gonna stay.

658
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:17,980
- 太好了 - 哦，咬我吧
- Wonderful. - Oh, bite me!

659
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,360
我 不想再听混话了
I don't need to hear the riot act again.

660
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,490
那再做一个试验呢?
How would you like another medical test?

661
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,430
- 什么? - 坐
- What? - Sit.

662
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,220
为什么?
Why?

663
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,410
那样你晕过去的时候不会 磕碎你的头骨
So you don't crack your skull when you pass out.

664
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:32,850
你就听话吧
Just do it.

665
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:37,500
- 你知道秋水仙碱是什么么? - 不
- You know what colchicine is? - No.

666
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:39,900
别在意，是加味的
Well, don't feel bad. It's for gout.

667
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:42,670
跟你的假装症状毫无关系
It's got nothing to do with anything you've ever pretended to have.

668
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:45,460
- 我没假装 - 闭嘴
- I'm not pretending... - Shut up.

669
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:50,520
秋水仙碱大量杀死你的白血球 不留痕迹
Colchicine decimates your white blood cells

670
00:30:49,174 --> 00:30:50,609
and leaves almost no trace.

671
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,090
用此假装入院很高明
It's great for faking your way into hospitals.

672
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:54,730
- 我没假装…… - 闭嘴
- I didn't fake my way... - Shut up.

673
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,950
你经年累月这样做
You've beeing this for years.

674
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,800
别担心，这也许不是你的错
Don't worry, it's probably not your fault.

675
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:05,170
在你小的时候，你有个近亲有慢性病
When you were a kid, you had a close relative who had a chronic disease,

676
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,460
可能是姐妹
probably your sister.

677
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:12,480
当你被忽视的时候 你看到她得到的注意
You saw all the attention she got while you were left alone, ignored.

678
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:15,550
而那当真把你伤害了
And it really seriously crewed you up.

679
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:18,110
- 我没有…… - 闭嘴
- I do not have a relative... - Shut up!

680
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,580
我给你你想要的
I'm trying to give you what you want.

681
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:27,090
挽救你的生命
And save your life.

682
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,910
你得了再障贫血
You have aplastic anemia.

683
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:32,570
什么，你想吓唬我么?
What, are you trying to scare me now?

684
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,900
也就是说你不光只脑子有毛病
It means you're not just sick in the head.

685
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,300
问题是你的其他部分良好
The problem is, the rest of you appears well.

686
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:40,970
所以我需要让你看上去病的很重
So I've got to make you seem as sick as you're supposed to be

687
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,570
我得给你注射与你症状相符的药物 使你看上去病情严重
by injecting you with a drug

688
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:45,802
that simulates symptoms that you actually have.

689
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:50,820
你需要知道的是……
All you need to know is...

690
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,470
你击中了妄想症的筹码
you've hit the Munchausen's jackpot.

691
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:56,370
我会给你一份胰岛素鸡尾酒让你抽搐
I'm gonna give you a cocktail of insulin for a seizure

692
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:59,640
用秋水仙碱来杀死白血球
and colchicine to kill your white count,

693
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:03,270
这就会完全证实 我关于再障贫血的诊断
this will absolutely confirm my diagnosis of aplastic anemia.

694
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:06,500
有一个小问题
There is one...small catch.

695
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:10,020
如果你真做了什么导致自己贫血
If you've actually done something to yourself to cause the anemia,

696
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:11,990
那我就错了
then I'm wrong.

697
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,870
而如果我做了我要做的
And if I do what I plan to do,

698
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:17,860
那治疗会导致你死亡而不是生存
then the treatment will kill you instead of saving you.

699
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,050
所以我需要知道
So I need to know.

700
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:24,540
除了胰岛素和激素
Have you been taking anything besides the insulin, the ACTH,

701
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:27,670
以及卡麦伦留下的药以外还吃了什么?
and the pills Cameron left in your room?

702
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,360
没
No.

703
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:40,460
好，把胳膊给我
Good.

704
00:32:38,047 --> 00:32:39,576
Give me your arm.

705
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:52,270
是我妈妈
It was my mom.

706
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:54,280
她得了ms
She had MS.

707
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,360
她总出入医院
She was in and out of hospitals all the time.

708
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:01,650
人们总在为她做事
People were always trying to do things for her.

709
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,740
给她拿吃的，帮她梳头...
Bring her food or brush her hair, or...

710
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,180
让她快乐
make her happy.

711
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,220
人们记挂她
People cared.

712
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:15,820
我16岁时她死了
She died when I was 16.

713
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:22,130
然后就谁都没了
Then there was no one.

714
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:27,390
哦吼
Boo hoo.

715
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,460
你去哪?
Where are you going?

716
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,590
哦，当事情发生时我不能在场
Well, I obviously can't be around when it happens.

717
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,650
你要干嘛？你就打算……
Well, what are you gonna do? You're just gonna...

718
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,590
放松，你知道细节
Relax. You know the drill.

719
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:44,450
总有人路过，你会没事的
People walk by here all the time. You'll be fine.

720
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,760
她又抽筋了
**So fairly off the door and she has another seizure.

721
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:11,130
她肯定是在出去的时候 顺手拿了点胰岛素
She must've somehow grabbed insulin on her way out.

722
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,360
等她稳定了，我们得把她弄走
Once she's stable, we need to get her out of here before she does more damage to herself.

723
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,460
在她再伤害自己之前.

724
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:16,900
我们不能
We can't.

725
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,540
她白血球下降了
Her white count's down.

726
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:22,040
对不起，我错过了
Sorry, I missed that.

727
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,870
理奇马丁音乐会后听力下降了
Hearing's been off since the Ricky Martin concert.

728
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:26,550
有人踢了我的头
Some cholo kicked me in the head.

729
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:29,720
白血球、血总值和血小板都没了
White count, hematocrit, and platelets are all off.

730
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,070
她的骨髓关闭了
Her bone marrow's shutting down. She actually has aplastic anemia.

731
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,680
她真有再障贫血

732
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,780
说什么?
Say what?

733
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:37,420
-她其他数据都没事 - 数据狗屁
Cameron: All her other labs show nothing that would...

734
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:41,000
好的诊断专家可以从数据中找问题
Lab ***. A good diagnostician reads between the labs.

735
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:42,310
你对了
You were right.

736
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:45,540
嘿，我们可不是在这抱怨
Hey, hey, hey. We're not here to play the blame game.

737
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,040
会发生这样的事
These things happen.

738
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:50,410
有时医生会把病人撵出去受死
Sometimes doctors send people out on the street to die

739
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:54,270
在被别的医生警告后依然把病人 撵出去受死
after other doctors warn them that they're sending people out on the street to die.

740
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,420
你不可能知道
There's no way you could know.

741
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,890
我去给她这个消息
I'll go give her the news.

742
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,680
你是谁?
Who are you?

743
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:10,300
我是福满医生
I'm Dr. Foreman. I'm in charge of your case.

744
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,700
我负责你的病例

745
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:16,130
你得了再障贫血
You have aplastic anemia.

746
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,780
意味着你的骨髓失效了
Which means your bone marrow has shut down.

747
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,780
你的身体拒绝造血
And your body can't make new blood anymore.

748
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,970
你肯定吗？
Are you sure?

749
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,300
我查了你的旧病例
I went back and checked your old records.

750
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,240
是合理的
It makes sense.

751
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,250
再障贫血已经发展几个月了
The aplastic anemia's apparently been developing for months.

752
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:35,690
我很抱歉，我们该早发现的
I'm sorry, we should've caught it earlier.

753
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:37,130
那……
So...

754
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,770
并不是最近的白血球读数导致的……
It's not just the latest white count that's leading you to feel this...

755
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,220
我知道这很可怕
I know this is scary.

756
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,500
但骨髓移植可以治愈
But a bone marrow transplant could cure you.

757
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:52,090
骨髓移植会要我命
A marrow transplant could kill me.

758
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:55,460
还有个方法是周换血
The other option is weekly blood transfusions.

759
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,040
注射gcsf
Injections of GCSF.

760
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,910
是终生制的
- It's a life-long regimen. - Yeah, I don't want that.

761
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,800
对，我不要

762
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,550
你肯定?
Are you sure?

763
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:08,610
我不想狠心
I-I don't want to be ruel here, but...

764
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:12,130
但你做了很多努力得到这样的注意
you jumped through a lot of hoops to get this sort of attention.

765
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,410
我就是想健康
I just wanna be healthy.

766
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:19,790
而你病的时候就没那么多乐趣了
It's not so much fun when you're actually sick.

767
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,900
不
No.

768
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,250
我们会……查查登记处
We'll um... we'll check the registry.

769
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:32,470
看是否有捐赠者
See if there's a donor match.

770
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,000
谢谢
Thank you.

771
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:46,020
在找到新骨髓前 我们要杀死所有老的
We have to kill all the old bone marrow before we give you the new stuff.

772
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,150
你就没有免疫系统了
You'll have no immune system.

773
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,330
我们会把你留在无菌室 确保一切都死了
We'll keep you in a sterile room for two weeks to make sure everything's dead.

774
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:53,090
然后给你捐赠的骨髓
Then we'll give you the donor marrow.

775
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,860
然后再用数周使其稳定
It'll take another couple of weeks until it takes hold.

776
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,880
你感觉不到什么
You won't feel a thing.

777
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,110
如果你觉得不舒服，或需要什么
If you get uncomfortable for any reason I need to talk, don't yell.

778
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,350
别喊
Walls are four inches thick. Lead.

779
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,020
墙有4英尺厚

780
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,120
向前
Use the microphone.

781
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,210
用麦克风

782
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:08,520
准备好了么?
Are you ready?

783
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:10,590
好
Okay.

784
00:37:10,014 --> 00:37:11,851
[Irradiation starts]

785
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,920
豪斯医生在哪?
Where's Dr. House?

786
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:08,030
关掉
Turn it off.

787
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:11,330
- 怎么了? - 她在里面多久了?
[Monitor starts beeping] Now what?

788
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:13,470
3分钟，怎么了?
How long has she been in there?

789
00:38:11,511 --> 00:38:13,285
Three minutes. What's going on?

790
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:15,420
她没有再障贫血
She doesn't have aplastic anemia.

791
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:16,930
她感染了
She has an infection.

792
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,080
不，她的白血球高的惊人
No. Her white count would be through the roof. Hers is one the floor.

793
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,620
这就是

794
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,440
身体干疯狂的事
- Well, the body does crazy things. - "The body does crazy things."

795
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,420
"身体干疯狂的事"

796
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:25,490
那就都解释了
Well, that explains everything.

797
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,580
她不发热
She had no fever.

798
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:30,170
因为她自己制造库欣症压制免疫系统
'Cause her self-inflicted Cushing's suppressed her immune system.

799
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:33,720
使她不发热，抑制感染
Stopped her from having a fever. Hid the infection.

800
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:39,070
梭菌可导致瘀伤、细胞分裂和贫血
Clostridium perfringens could cause the bruises, schistocytes, the anemia...

801
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,910
都能解释除了白血球的问题
Explains everything except the white count.

802
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,310
查证比摧毁她的免疫系统安全的多
Augmentin is a lot safer than destroying her immune system. Why don't we try that?

803
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,510
干嘛不试试?

804
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,500
你要选择安全路径?
Ww-you're taking the safe course?

805
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,290
怎么回事?
What's going on?

806
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,610
白血球低有很多原因
There's lots of explanations for a low white count.

807
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,970
说一种符合她的症状
Name one that fits her case.

808
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,670
秋水仙碱
Colchicine.

809
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:12,180
我猜她能拿到
I figure that she'd gotten her hands on it and, uh, just self-medicated.

810
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,500
就自己给药了

811
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:16,810
她多聪明
That's brilliant of her!

812
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:22,290
用了正好可以证实你诊断的药
Take the exact medication that would confirm your diagnosis.

813
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,050
人们会做疯狂的事
People do crazy things.

814
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,930
你给她用药 违背她的意愿以证实自己对?
You injected her against her will just so you could be right?

815
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,250
- 她同意 - 她精神有病
- She consented. - She's mentally ill!

816
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,870
她闻上去非常甜美
But she smells oh so sweet.

817
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,430
我让说她严重的时候她该变严重
She would've gotten sicker when I said she was gonna get sicker,

818
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,520
而卡麦伦给了她抗生素
except Cameron dosed her with antibiotics. Just hold this.

819
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:40,620
拿好
- Is everything okay? - Pull my finger.

820
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,730
一切都好么?

821
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,770
拉我的手指

822
00:39:44,052 --> 00:39:45,247
[Gasps]

823
00:39:45,742 --> 00:39:47,007
[Sniffs]

824
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,450
象葡萄似的
Grapey.

825
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,850
你有细菌
You have a bacterium.

826
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,350
大家都有
It's on all of us. But...

827
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:55,800
而你给自己库欣症的伤痕 却给了它一个家
the bruises you gave yourself with the Cushing's made a lovely home.

828
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:00,600
细菌搬进来，做了邻居
Bacteria moved in,

829
00:39:57,793 --> 00:40:00,505
parked their cars on the lawn. There goes the neighborhood.

830
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:04,050
邻居的意思是跟你的内脏
By "neighborhood" I mean your internal organs.

831
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:06,780
那么我们是不是该给她做点什么?
So, should we put her on the Augmentin, boss?

832
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:09,710
还是你觉得她自己注射了葡萄?
Or do you think she injected herself with grapes? [Sniffs]

833
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:13,880
我喜欢闻这个
I love the smell of pus in the morning.

834
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,000
闻上去象...
Smells like...

835
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,530
胜利的味道
victory.

836
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,440
如果你正式提议
If you were serious about the offer,

837
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,740
我会严肃接受
I'm serious about accepting.

838
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:29,150
我想掌管部门
I'd like to run the department.

839
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,240
而且你自己说事情很顺畅
And you said it yourself, things run smooth.

840
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:35,060
除了豪斯在你背后的行为
Except for the part where House went behind your back

841
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:38,360
给病人用胰岛素和秋水仙碱
and KO'd the patient with insulin and colchicine.

842
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,040
没理由怀疑是感染
There was no reason to suspect an infection.

843
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:43,780
连豪斯也没那么怀疑
Even House didn't think it was an infection.

844
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:45,640
你也会做同样的事
You would've done the same thing I did.

845
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:47,840
而我同样也会错
And I'd be just as wrong.

846
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,870
豪斯的作为很疯狂 却保存了她的性命
What House did was insane. But he saved her life.

847
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:51,790
他很幸运
He got lucky.

848
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,980
他让她承认自己有病
He got her to admit she's got a problem.

849
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,420
她同意做院外处理
She's agreed to out-patient treatment.

850
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:58,550
他太走运了
He gets lucky a lot.

851
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,360
你真的有意要给我这个工作么?
Did you ever really intend to give me this job?

852
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:08,170
还是你只是在阻止我走下坡路？
Or were you just trying to stop me from stepping down?

853
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:10,930
你还有两周负责
You've got two more weeks in charge.

854
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,820
希望下个病例能成功
Hopefully the next case will go better.

855
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:22,830
她本来会死
She should've died.

856
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,460
豪斯不是英雄
House is not a hero.

857
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:28,340
敢于打破陋习的人
A person who has the guts to break a bad rule,

858
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:30,330
才是英雄
they're a hero.

859
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,120
豪斯没打破陋习，他忽视它们
House doesn't break rules. He ignores them.

860
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:35,310
他不是罗莎帕可
He's not Rosa Parks.

861
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:37,360
他是无政府主义者
He's an anarchist.

862
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,270
他所维护的是
All he stands for is the right

863
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:43,110
所见所得所需
for everyone to grab whatever they want whenever they want.

864
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,680
你告诉医生那没事
You tell doctors that's okay,

865
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:49,130
你的死亡率会高过屋顶
your mortality rate is gonna go through the roof.

866
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:56,960
福满负责的事挺好
Kinda digging this whole Foreman-in-charge thing.

867
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,520
你知道
You know.

868
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:02,850
让我有空看连续剧
It frees me up to watch my soaps.

869
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:04,690
下午看电影
Catch a movie in the afternoon.

870
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,350
跟你一起吃晚餐
Have lunch with you.

871
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,190
对，对你是个大变化
Yeah, that's a big change for you.

872
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:12,750
现在卡迪要看的是福满的屁股 不是我的了
Now Cuddy's up Foreman's ass, not mine.

873
00:42:14,684 --> 00:42:18,219
<i># Carols everywhere...#</i>

874
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:20,890
你受不了福满做你的老板
You couldn't live with Foreman as your boss.

875
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,090
为什么不?
Why not?

876
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:25,410
人会变，你知道
People can change, you know.

877
00:42:28,896 --> 00:42:33,261
<i># Sleigh bells in the air #</i>

<i># Beauty everywhere... #</i>

879
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:38,830
你的白血球降下去了
- White count is way down. - Oh.

880
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:40,300
我们会接纳你
We're going to need to admit you. Just run a few more tests.

881
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:41,600
再做点检查
Whatever you think is best.

882
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,310
你觉得好就做吧
