<i>[Narrator] Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

3
00:00:03,626 --> 00:00:05,456
你已经无法为她做任何事了
You can't help her now.

4
00:00:05,496 --> 00:00:07,596
你并不关心私人问题
You don't ask a lot of personal questions.

5
00:00:08,866 --> 00:00:10,446
而且你非常难相处
And you're very hard to get to know.

6
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:11,467
Yes.

7
00:00:11,426 --> 00:00:12,046
是的
With your reputation, Seattle Grace will become

8
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:14,516
以你多年的经验，seattle grace将成为

9
00:00:14,516 --> 00:00:16,216
曼哈顿西部的知名产科医院之一.
one of the foremost neonatal hospitals.

10
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:17,376
我们这里有一个三级烧伤患者.
Got a third trimester burn victim, Dr. Bailey. I need help.

11
00:00:17,376 --> 00:00:20,576
Dr. Bailey,我需要帮忙

12
00:00:20,576 --> 00:00:22,286
你在我的领域有不错的天赋
You show a real gift with my specialty.

13
00:00:22,286 --> 00:00:24,456
我会在这里呆上一阵子的
I'll be staying in town for a while.

14
00:00:24,456 --> 00:00:25,886
再见,derek.
Goodbye, Derek.

15
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:27,836
再见,meredith.
Bye, Meredith.

16
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,046
想请我喝杯东西吗?
Do you wanna buy me a drink?

17
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,158
[Giggling]

18
00:00:41,746 --> 00:00:42,936
当你还是孩子的时候,
<i>[Meredith] When you were a kid,</i> <i>it was Halloween candy.</i>

19
00:00:42,936 --> 00:00:44,626
你喜欢万圣节的糖果.

20
00:00:50,936 --> 00:00:54,486
你从父母那里骗来，然后一直吃到恶心
<i>You hid it from your parents</i> <i>and ate it until you got sick.</i>

21
00:00:59,686 --> 00:01:01,636
这里就是... 你住的地方?
[Cristina] So, this is where you live?

22
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:03,018
[Giggles]

23
00:01:04,326 --> 00:01:06,976
而在大学的时候，变成了猛烈的混合物
<i>In college, it was the heady combo</i> <i>of youth, tequila, and, well, you know.</i>

24
00:01:06,976 --> 00:01:10,046
年轻，酒，和那个...你知道.

25
00:01:14,966 --> 00:01:17,656
作为一个医生，你需要
<i>As a surgeon, you take</i> <i>as much of the good as you can get,</i>

26
00:01:17,656 --> 00:01:19,066
尽可能的做到尽善尽美...

27
00:01:21,906 --> 00:01:25,696
因为改正错误的机会,并不是经常发生
<i>because it doesn't come around</i> <i>nearly as often as it should.</i>

28
00:01:35,176 --> 00:01:37,896
因为好事永远不是表面看起来那样
<i>Good things</i> <i>aren't always what they seem.</i>

29
00:01:40,176 --> 00:01:41,426
太棒了.
That was amazing.

30
00:01:42,146 --> 00:01:43,376
是啊,爽
Yeah.

31
00:01:43,826 --> 00:01:45,276
什么东西太多了的话..
<i>Too much of anything, even love,</i> <i>is not always a good thing.</i>

32
00:01:45,276 --> 00:01:46,536
即使是爱情...

33
00:01:46,536 --> 00:01:48,566
也不会永远那么美好了
Did you...

34
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:49,196
你有(高潮吗?)...

35
00:01:51,586 --> 00:01:53,356
恩
Yeah. I did.

36
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:58,278
- [Meredith] There's a boy in my bed. - <i>[Cristina] What's his name?</i>

37
00:01:56,436 --> 00:01:57,966
我床上有个男人

38
00:01:57,966 --> 00:01:59,046
叫什么?
Um... Steve.

39
00:01:59,046 --> 00:02:01,036
Um,steve.
- Where'd you find him? - <i>joe's.</i>

40
00:02:01,036 --> 00:02:02,086
你哪里找到的?

41
00:02:02,086 --> 00:02:02,836
Joe的酒吧.

42
00:02:02,836 --> 00:02:05,706
猜猜我在哪里
- Guess where I am? - <i>Where?</i>

43
00:02:05,706 --> 00:02:06,616
哪里?
Burke's apartment. He went to the hospital.

44
00:02:06,616 --> 00:02:08,306
Burke的公寓

45
00:02:08,306 --> 00:02:09,856
他去医院了
[Spits]

46
00:02:11,066 --> 00:02:13,466
他把我自己留在这里了
He left me here alone.

47
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,546
你要对他的东西彻底检查,对吧?
<i>You're going through his stuff,</i> <i>aren't you?</i>

48
00:02:15,546 --> 00:02:18,126
哦,根本没有什么值得我检查的.
There's no stuff to go through. It's a freak show.

49
00:02:18,126 --> 00:02:19,336
他这是个怪地方
You can do surgery in here.

50
00:02:19,336 --> 00:02:20,856
我是说,你都能在这里做手术了

51
00:02:21,696 --> 00:02:22,856
Oh...
Oh...

52
00:02:25,206 --> 00:02:28,626
他按照杜威图书分类法给他的书籍归类
He arranged his books using the Dewey Decimal system.

53
00:02:28,626 --> 00:02:29,646
Mer,我害怕
- Mer, I'm scared. - Get out. Get out of the house now.

54
00:02:29,646 --> 00:02:32,156
离开那里,现在就离开那公寓

55
00:02:32,156 --> 00:02:33,666
和谁说话呢?
Who you talking to?

56
00:02:34,426 --> 00:02:37,126
我要挂了
Uh... I gotta go.

57
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:38,352
<i>[Phone beeps]</i>

58
00:02:39,636 --> 00:02:41,356
Uh...
Uh... I have to go take a shower.

59
00:02:41,356 --> 00:02:43,576
我要去洗个澡
And when I get back, you won't be here. So, um... goodbye, Steve.

60
00:02:43,576 --> 00:02:45,986
当我回来的时候,希望你就不在这里了

61
00:02:45,986 --> 00:02:48,806
那么,再见了,steve.

62
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:10,636
新"西雅图未眠夜"啊
Another sleepless night in Seattle.

63
00:03:10,636 --> 00:03:13,416
是啊,这次又是谁?背上长毛的家伙?
Who was it this time? "Hairy Back Guy"?

64
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:14,346
知道我想谁吗?
You know who I miss? "Inappropriate Facial Hair Guy."

65
00:03:14,346 --> 00:03:15,976
那个胡须不对称的家伙.
You know, he did his own dishes.

66
00:03:16,436 --> 00:03:18,356
知道吗他洗了自己的盘子?
"Tattooed Ass Guy" made coffee.

67
00:03:18,356 --> 00:03:21,206
屁股上有文身的家伙还煮过咖啡呢

68
00:03:21,206 --> 00:03:22,626
是啊,他是个看门的
Yeah, he was a keeper.

69
00:03:24,406 --> 00:03:25,456
怎么了?
What? What? Meredith?

70
00:03:26,286 --> 00:03:27,156
Meredith?
- I am over her. - OK.

71
00:03:27,156 --> 00:03:29,146
我早不迷恋她了

72
00:03:29,216 --> 00:03:30,296
Okay.
- I am. - Yeah, I can see that.

73
00:03:30,296 --> 00:03:31,476
我的确放弃了

74
00:03:31,476 --> 00:03:33,076
是啊,我看出来了
But, is she trying to set some kind of record?

75
00:03:33,076 --> 00:03:36,006
尽管如此,她是在试图创造什么记录吗?

76
00:03:36,006 --> 00:03:37,346
至少她还有个目标
At least she has a goal.

77
00:03:39,206 --> 00:03:40,316
Oh. Oh.
Oh.

78
00:03:41,086 --> 00:03:42,156
哦,他是新的哦
- He's new. - And I shall name him: "Running Guy."

79
00:03:42,156 --> 00:03:44,656
那我就叫他"逃跑小子"吧

80
00:03:45,566 --> 00:03:49,626
知道昨晚我听到Alex和谁一起回家来了吗?
You know who I heard Alex come home with last night?

81
00:03:50,526 --> 00:03:51,096
你
- You. - I don't want to talk about it.

82
00:03:51,096 --> 00:03:52,486
我不想聊这个
- [Chuckles] - I really do want to talk about it.

83
00:03:53,126 --> 00:03:54,876
事实上,我挺想聊聊这个的
He doesn't want to talk about it because there were technical difficulties.

84
00:03:54,876 --> 00:03:56,296
但是他不想

85
00:03:56,296 --> 00:03:59,686
因为那个...技术上的困难

86
00:03:59,686 --> 00:04:00,416
什么?
- What? - You know, he didn't... He...

87
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:03,076
那个,他没有...他....

88
00:04:03,996 --> 00:04:05,506
-不 -别说了
- No. - Stop it.

89
00:04:05,506 --> 00:04:07,426
你不许乱说话
You can't say anything.

90
00:04:08,696 --> 00:04:09,806
George,别笑了
- George, stop it. - I...

91
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:11,256
我...下次我见到他的时候
I'm gonna at least think about making fun of him when I see him.

92
00:04:11,256 --> 00:04:13,436
至少我能想想如何取笑他

93
00:04:13,436 --> 00:04:15,076
他说他以前从没做过
- He said it never happened before. - That's what we all say.

94
00:04:15,076 --> 00:04:16,656
哦,这是大家都在说的

95
00:04:17,476 --> 00:04:20,326
我认真的,所有人都是这么说的
And I mean, "they." That's what "they" all say.

96
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:21,496
我不知道
I don't know. Maybe this relationship just isn't meant to be.

97
00:04:21,496 --> 00:04:23,796
也许这段感情根本就不到那个地步
I mean, I just need some sex, George, you know?

98
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:25,476
我是说,我只是...

99
00:04:25,476 --> 00:04:29,056
只是需要做爱罢了 george

100
00:04:29,056 --> 00:04:29,946
明白吗?我不过...
I need sex now! You know what I mean?

101
00:04:29,946 --> 00:04:32,036
我现在就要做爱.明白我说什么吗?

102
00:04:34,486 --> 00:04:36,616
无论你怎么求我...
No matter how hard you beg, I am not doing you.

103
00:04:37,036 --> 00:04:38,786
我也不会做你的

104
00:04:46,276 --> 00:04:47,906
欢迎你的加入
- Nice to have you on board. - Thank you, Patricia.

105
00:04:47,906 --> 00:04:49,136
谢谢patricia.

106
00:04:50,606 --> 00:04:52,186
你工作自由
Your own service, a state-of-the-art NICU,

107
00:04:52,186 --> 00:04:54,136
艺术级的工作待遇
and a salary that makes you one of the highest-paid surgeons in the northwest.

108
00:04:54,136 --> 00:04:56,386
以及一份高薪-

109
00:04:56,386 --> 00:04:58,246
足以让你成为西北地区最高收入的医生
- You better be worth it. - Quintuplets, Richard.

110
00:04:58,246 --> 00:04:59,926
你最好对得起这薪水

111
00:04:59,926 --> 00:05:02,106
五胞胎产妇,richard.对吗?
- That's a go. - Mother-to-be checked in today.

112
00:05:02,106 --> 00:05:03,746
今早这个即将临盆的孕妇送了进来
Nothing I like more than a high-profile case.

113
00:05:03,746 --> 00:05:05,886
没什么比一个特殊病例更让我喜欢的了

114
00:05:05,886 --> 00:05:07,636
别把结论下的太早
Don't go calling the press in yet. It's a high-risk pregnancy.

115
00:05:07,636 --> 00:05:09,706
这是个极度高危险的怀孕
Three babies are surgical. I'll need people from all departments.

116
00:05:09,706 --> 00:05:11,326
至少三个婴儿是可以手术治愈的

117
00:05:11,326 --> 00:05:13,446
事实上,我需要从所有的科系调人手过来帮忙
You're my star. Whatever you need.

118
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:14,366
你说了算

119
00:05:15,266 --> 00:05:16,196
无论你需要什么

120
00:05:17,846 --> 00:05:20,156
这航班上有餐点供应吗?
Is there meal service on this flight?

121
00:05:20,156 --> 00:05:22,476
Robert martin,45岁,昏倒的时候撞击了头部
Robert Martin, 45, hit his head, causing a small subdural hemorrhage.

122
00:05:22,476 --> 00:05:24,306
导致小面积脑硬膜出血
Also, uncontrolled eye movement and delirium.

123
00:05:24,306 --> 00:05:26,276
同时伴有眼睛失控,以及暂时性精神狂乱

124
00:05:26,276 --> 00:05:28,316
酒精和毒性测试均为阴性
Alcohol and tox screens were negative, but sodium level is 112.

125
00:05:28,316 --> 00:05:29,626
但是他体内的钠指数只有112.
- A little too low for my taste. - <i>[Martin] Hey! Hey!</i>

126
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:31,666
我觉得有点低

127
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,196
hey. Hey!

128
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:36,206
Mr. Martin,你那边还好吗?
Mr. Martin, how are you doing in there?

129
00:05:36,206 --> 00:05:39,766
我还在等我要的喝的呢.你是空姐吗?
<i>I'm still waiting on that drink.</i> <i>Are you the stewardess?</i>

130
00:05:39,766 --> 00:05:41,416
我们马上就去叫空姐
We're called flight attendants now.

131
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:42,496
Hey!
<i>Hey!</i>

132
00:05:42,496 --> 00:05:45,236
Hey! Oh,看这里.
Hey!

133
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:46,910
There it is. On his pituitary, it's a Rathke's cleft cyst.

134
00:05:45,236 --> 00:05:47,206
在他的垂体上方,一个小小的裂开的囊肿.

135
00:05:47,206 --> 00:05:48,856
-那么他是hyponatremic了(钠指数低于135mmol/l) -没错
He's hyponatremic. Thirst is a side effect.

136
00:05:48,856 --> 00:05:50,636
经常性的口渴就是一个普遍的副作用
- Water's screwing up his sodium levels. - Causing his delirium.

137
00:05:50,636 --> 00:05:52,116
水能够提高他的钠指数

138
00:05:52,116 --> 00:05:53,046
并且导致他的精神错乱
How do you treat hyponatremia?

139
00:05:53,046 --> 00:05:55,336
那么你如何治疗hyponatremia?

140
00:05:55,336 --> 00:05:57,986
3%高渗亚生理盐水静脉注射
Three percent hypertonic saline solution IV, 300 CCs over three hours.

141
00:05:57,986 --> 00:06:00,096
3个钟头内要注射300 cc以上
Great. Call me when he stabilizes.

142
00:06:00,096 --> 00:06:01,656
做的好,带他回病房吧

143
00:06:01,656 --> 00:06:03,976
稳定下来后叫我,做的不错dr. Karev.
- Nicely done, Dr. Karev. - Hey! When does the movie start?

144
00:06:03,976 --> 00:06:04,506
Hey!

145
00:06:04,506 --> 00:06:05,896
电影什么时候开始?
Dorie, this is Dr. Stevens. She'll be working with us.

146
00:06:05,896 --> 00:06:07,836
Dorie,这是 dr. Stevens.

147
00:06:07,836 --> 00:06:09,196
她会帮我跟进你的病情的
- The more, the merrier. - How far along are you?

148
00:06:09,196 --> 00:06:12,726
-人越多越热闹 -显然.你怀孕多久了?

149
00:06:12,726 --> 00:06:13,736
32周.
- 32 weeks. - How long is a normal gestation period?

150
00:06:13,736 --> 00:06:15,586
一般的怀孕周期是多久?
40 weeks, but with twins 36 weeks is considered full term,

151
00:06:15,586 --> 00:06:17,436
40周,但是如果是双胞胎的话

152
00:06:17,436 --> 00:06:19,276
36周就算是满周期了
so with quints 34 weeks is considered extremely successful.

153
00:06:19,276 --> 00:06:22,666
而就五胞胎来说,34周就算非常成功了

154
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,806
给他们一些退烧药就好了
Mom, give him some acetaminophen. It's in the medicine cabinet.

155
00:06:24,806 --> 00:06:26,026
在药柜里面呢
I plan on going 36 weeks. No one's leaving this uterus until I say so.

156
00:06:26,026 --> 00:06:27,576
我是计划到36周再生

157
00:06:27,576 --> 00:06:30,166
谁也不能离开这子宫,直到我同意为止

158
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,616
积极想法的力量,恩?
Power of positive thinking?

159
00:06:31,616 --> 00:06:32,876
恩,卧床修养期
That, bed rest and all your medical care.

160
00:06:32,876 --> 00:06:34,406
以及所有你给我的医疗关怀
We're with the doctors now. So, I'll talk to you later.

161
00:06:34,406 --> 00:06:37,826
医生现在在做检查呢,过会我再打给你

162
00:06:38,846 --> 00:06:39,796
Okay,bye.
OK, bye.

163
00:06:41,206 --> 00:06:43,386
adam有点发烧
[Sighs]

164
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,593
Adam's got a fever, so soon they'll all have a fever.

165
00:06:43,386 --> 00:06:45,306
那将意味着过不了多久他们都会染上的
Mom won't make it through lunch.

166
00:06:45,306 --> 00:06:47,136
我想妈妈在午餐时间搞不定这个了
We have four-year-old boys. Adam, Oliver, and Graham.

167
00:06:47,136 --> 00:06:49,886
我们家里有4岁的男孩...

168
00:06:49,886 --> 00:06:52,846
-adam,oliver和graham. -三胞胎? 你... 你们已经有了个三胞胎了?
Triplets? You already have triplets?

169
00:06:53,486 --> 00:06:55,686
我猜当你们在服用那些避孕药的时候
When you take fertility pills, you should read the fine print.

170
00:06:55,686 --> 00:06:56,726
真应该好好读读上面的说明
- Dr. Stevens... - I'm sorry, I just... I meant...

171
00:06:56,726 --> 00:06:58,206
Dr. Stevens.

172
00:06:58,206 --> 00:07:00,396
对不起,我只是,我是说..
It's OK. I'm used to it. I just really wanted a girl.

173
00:07:00,396 --> 00:07:03,346
没关系,我都习惯了,我只是很想要个女儿

174
00:07:03,346 --> 00:07:05,136
是啊,我们只是没想到会同时来5个女儿
- We just didn't bank on five girls. - But think of all the clothes.

175
00:07:05,136 --> 00:07:08,776
但是想想那些美丽的衣服和小可爱们吧
- And all that pink cuteness. - That's your happy place, remember?

176
00:07:08,776 --> 00:07:10,436
亲爱的,那是你高兴的地方,记得吗?
Oh, yeah.

177
00:07:10,436 --> 00:07:11,146
Oh,yeah.

178
00:07:14,256 --> 00:07:17,316
试着别把所有闯进你大脑的东西都说出来
Try not to say everything that pops into your brain.

179
00:07:21,176 --> 00:07:24,036
当我把他们踢出去的时候他们总是看起来挺难过
[Sighs] They always look so sad when I kick them out.

180
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,540
[Both chuckle]

181
00:07:26,496 --> 00:07:29,166
认真的问,为什么
Seriously, why do guys not understand that when you pick them up in a bar

182
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,336
男人都不明白当你在酒吧里遇到他们
and take them home for sex, there are no picket fences or kids in your future?

183
00:07:30,336 --> 00:07:31,406
然后带他们回家上床

184
00:07:31,406 --> 00:07:33,546
根本不意味着你们会有一个大房子和一群孩子的未来?

185
00:07:39,046 --> 00:07:40,256
Burke把钥匙给你了?
- Burke "keyed" you? - I got freaking "keyed" before coffee.

186
00:07:40,256 --> 00:07:42,136
得到咖啡之前弄到了一把钥匙

187
00:07:42,136 --> 00:07:44,336
那怎么了?
- What is wrong with them? - They're like these 1950s debutantes.

188
00:07:44,336 --> 00:07:46,246
他们就像50年代的社交活动那样
One dance, and there's a shotgun to your head.

189
00:07:46,246 --> 00:07:48,946
跳支舞,然后冲你的头开枪

190
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,026
Meredith.
Meredith.

191
00:07:53,566 --> 00:07:57,226
-你在这里工作? -你在这里干吗steve?
- You work here? - What are you doing here, Steve?

192
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,006
我有一点小问题
- I'm having a little problem. - "Steve," Steve?

193
00:07:59,006 --> 00:08:00,286
那个"steve"的steve?
Actually, I'm having a big problem.

194
00:08:00,286 --> 00:08:02,236
事实上,我遇到麻烦了

195
00:08:03,796 --> 00:08:04,706
什么?
- What? - Steve, hi. Cristina.

196
00:08:04,706 --> 00:08:07,056
Steve,hi. Cristina.

197
00:08:08,236 --> 00:08:12,236
自从我和你... 它就持续勃起.
Ever since you and I... It won't go away.

198
00:08:14,816 --> 00:08:15,356
Cristina!
- Cristina! - What? It's right there, looking at me.

199
00:08:15,356 --> 00:08:17,156
怎么了? 它就在那里看着我呢.

200
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:24,416
呵呵,此时此刻我有好多话想和你说
There are so many things I could say right now.

201
00:08:26,616 --> 00:08:27,366
你真是冠军.
Champ.

202

206
00:08:59,744 --> 00:09:00,864
你们觉得这严重吗?
Do you think it's serious? It hurts like it is.

207
00:09:00,864 --> 00:09:04,034
-我疼的厉害 -你意识到这个有多愚蠢了吗?
You realize this is insane.

208
00:09:04,034 --> 00:09:05,394
听着,我们必须把他藏在哪里
We have to stash him somewhere until we figure this out.

209
00:09:05,394 --> 00:09:06,744
直到我们找出到底什么原因为止
- I can't have people finding out. - I'm not going down for this.

210
00:09:06,744 --> 00:09:09,534
-我不能让这个传遍整个医院 -我不会到处传这个的

211
00:09:09,534 --> 00:09:11,684
你弄坏了这家伙的小弟弟不是我的错
- It's not my fault you broke his penis. - You broke his what?

212
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:14,334
弄坏他的什么?快点... hey,hey.

213
00:09:14,334 --> 00:09:16,754
别让我到处追你们,我这里可养着个孩子呢
Don't make me chase you down. I'm growing a person here.

214
00:09:16,754 --> 00:09:19,264
我要去看看检查结果了
I gotta check on some labs.

215
00:09:28,704 --> 00:09:29,574
看起来如何?
How's it look?

216
00:09:30,584 --> 00:09:31,474
不错
- Not bad. - Not bad?

217
00:09:31,474 --> 00:09:33,054
不错?
"Not bad" is good when you have five babies in your uterus.

218
00:09:33,054 --> 00:09:34,444
不错就是很好

219
00:09:34,444 --> 00:09:35,934
当你有5个孩子在你子宫里的时候

220
00:09:38,914 --> 00:09:39,914
Oh.
[Sighs]

221
00:09:39,914 --> 00:09:41,644
这是kate.
It's Kate. She kicks me so hard it's like a belly burn every time.

222
00:09:41,644 --> 00:09:43,384
她踢我还挺狠的

223
00:09:43,384 --> 00:09:45,634
每次都像肚子要破了一样

224
00:09:45,634 --> 00:09:47,134
你已经给他们起好名字了?
You've named them already?

225
00:09:47,704 --> 00:09:49,134
我知道你觉得我很疯狂
I know you think I'm crazy, or maybe just a little bit stupid?

226
00:09:49,534 --> 00:09:51,364
或者也许只是 一点点愚蠢?

227
00:09:52,474 --> 00:09:53,694
Mrs. Russell,对不起
Mrs. Russell, I'm sorry if I've offended you...

228
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:55,354
如果我做了什么冒犯你的事情
The only thing that will offend me is if you pretend

229
00:09:55,354 --> 00:09:56,644
只有一件事情会冒犯我

230
00:09:56,644 --> 00:09:58,414
就是如果你假装你从来没有评价过我
you didn't judge me immediately.

231
00:09:58,414 --> 00:09:59,374
自从我们相遇的那刻起

232
00:10:01,024 --> 00:10:02,634
我们会在一起共渡一段时间的
We'll spend a lot of time together, so we may as well be honest.

233
00:10:02,634 --> 00:10:04,424
所以诚实点对我们会好一些对吗?

234
00:10:08,914 --> 00:10:11,284
如果你能减少婴儿即使只是两个
If you had reduced the fetuses even by two,

235
00:10:11,284 --> 00:10:13,774
其他3个就会在你子宫里孕育久一些
the others could've been carried longer, been more developed and healthier.

236
00:10:13,774 --> 00:10:16,014
吸收足够的营养,并且健康的生下来

237
00:10:16,014 --> 00:10:18,674
你是第16个告诉我这些话的医生了
You're about the sixteenth doctor who's told me that.

238
00:10:23,994 --> 00:10:25,564
这个在这上面...
This one up here, this is Charlotte.

239
00:10:25,564 --> 00:10:27,654
这是charlotte.
She's the stubborn one.

240
00:10:27,654 --> 00:10:28,954
她是最顽皮的那个
Lodged under my rib cage and won't budge.

241
00:10:28,954 --> 00:10:31,354
留在我的胸腔里面,不肯移动

242
00:10:32,074 --> 00:10:34,654
而这边...
Over here, Lucy.

243
00:10:34,654 --> 00:10:36,334
lucy.

244
00:10:36,984 --> 00:10:38,564
她是个坏孩子
She's a badass.

245
00:10:39,394 --> 00:10:41,024
如果她被踢到,她一定会踢回去.
She gets kicked, she kicks back.

246
00:10:41,834 --> 00:10:43,994
Emily.
Emily, she has the hiccups almost every day.

247
00:10:45,574 --> 00:10:47,694
她几乎每天都打嗝

248
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,004
[Dorie laughs]

249
00:10:49,664 --> 00:10:52,134
而这边是julie. 她是个成熟的孩子
And over here is Julie, she's pretty mellow.

250
00:10:52,134 --> 00:10:53,964
每过一小会,她就要翻身调整姿势
Every once in a while she just turns over,

251
00:10:53,964 --> 00:10:56,744
然后现在我们又回到了...
which brings us back to Kate.

252
00:10:57,864 --> 00:10:59,724
kate.

253
00:11:01,434 --> 00:11:02,704
那个让你肚子爆炸的孩子
- Who gives you belly burn. - Every time she kicks.

254
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,134
每次当她踢我的时候

255
00:11:06,804 --> 00:11:08,664
我们只是把他带来这里
We were just bringing him up here because he's got this problem.

256
00:11:08,664 --> 00:11:12,664
因为他只是有这个....问题,看到了?

257
00:11:12,664 --> 00:11:15,184
他只是个朋友而已.
And he's a... a friend.

258
00:11:15,184 --> 00:11:17,934
你朋友吃什么了?
What did your friend take?

259
00:11:17,934 --> 00:11:20,314
-吃什么? -那些勃起功能障碍的药物?
- Take? - Which erectile dysfunction drug?

260
00:11:20,314 --> 00:11:22,074
-你吃... -绝对没有,我发誓
- You took... - Absolutely not, I swear.

261
00:11:22,074 --> 00:11:24,184
-我们之间完全是自然反映 -闭嘴
- It was all natural between us. - Shut up.

262
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:27,684
你这种情况叫做priapism(阴茎持续勃起症)
Your condition is called priapism,

263
00:11:27,684 --> 00:11:30,594
一般是因为过度服用e.d.s(勃起功能障碍药物)
usually brought on by the overuse of EDs.

264
00:11:30,594 --> 00:11:31,944
我什么都没吃
I didn't take anything.

265
00:11:31,944 --> 00:11:34,364
我们只能相信你所说的
We'll have to take your word for it. There's no test to see if you're lying.

266
00:11:34,364 --> 00:11:35,984
因为如果你一直撒谎的话,根本没任何测试可以看到
We'll have to look for other causes.

267
00:11:35,984 --> 00:11:38,224
我们需要找出其他成因

268
00:11:38,224 --> 00:11:39,864
很多检查需要做
There'll be lots of labs, lots of procedures.

269
00:11:39,864 --> 00:11:42,214
还有很多...其他程序...

270
00:11:42,214 --> 00:11:44,084
疼痛程序...
Painful procedures.

271
00:11:44,084 --> 00:11:47,534
这测试会让你觉得,恨不得就没长过小弟弟
Procedures which might make you wish you never had a penis.

272
00:11:47,534 --> 00:11:49,004
你确定你不想改变你的说法?
- Sure you won't change your story? - I swear I'm clean.

273
00:11:49,004 --> 00:11:51,114
我发誓我是清白的

274
00:11:51,114 --> 00:11:53,634
好吧Grey,去开始做他的测试吧
All right. Grey, start his workup.

275
00:11:53,634 --> 00:11:57,064
做一些血测试,注射一些度冷丁来止痛
Get some blood. Get him some meperidine for his pain.

276
00:11:57,064 --> 00:11:59,244
你的朋友现在已经肯定他的说法了
As of now, your friend is admitted.

277
00:12:02,184 --> 00:12:04,484
Dorie russell...将要产下五胞胎
Dorie Russell, she's giving birth to quints.

278
00:12:04,484 --> 00:12:05,834
恩richard说了我们要随时侯命
Richard said we were on standby.

279
00:12:05,834 --> 00:12:07,674
这没什么,真的.因为这并不是
Which is no problem. It's not like I have a neurosurgery department to run.

280
00:12:07,674 --> 00:12:09,494
好像我有个神经外科或者其他什么忙着要管理一样

281
00:12:09,984 --> 00:12:12,944
是啊,很明显我们的科都在她的管理之下
Yes. Apparently our departments are at her disposal.

282
00:12:12,944 --> 00:12:15,014
你们现在有时间和妈妈聊聊吗?
Do you have time to talk to the mom? I want her to meet all her surgeons.

283
00:12:15,014 --> 00:12:18,204
-我想她见见其他手术组的成员 -好的,没问题
- Yes, no problem. - I'll come by after I finish in the OR.

284
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:19,924
我一从手术室出来就去
- Thank you, Dr. Burke. - Sure!

285
00:12:19,924 --> 00:12:21,774
-谢谢dr. Burke -没问题

286
00:12:23,804 --> 00:12:25,644
我没听到你今早离开酒店房间
I didn't hear you leave the hotel room this morning.

287
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:26,584
我在早饭的时候想你了
I had an early surgery.

288
00:12:26,584 --> 00:12:27,904
我有一个很早的手术

289
00:12:28,644 --> 00:12:30,554
你确定就因为这个?没其他了?
You're sure that's all? Nothing's wrong?

290
00:12:30,554 --> 00:12:32,704
没有,就像我说的,我只是有个很早的手术而已
No, like I said, I had an early surgery.

291
00:12:33,464 --> 00:12:34,234
Okay.
OK.

292
00:12:34,234 --> 00:12:36,444
我觉得像一只搁浅的鲸鱼一样
[Sighs] I feel like a beached whale.

293
00:12:36,444 --> 00:12:39,784
Dorie,这是dr. Shepherd. 他是我们的神经科主任
Dorie, this is Dr. Shepherd, he's our head of neurosurgery.

294
00:12:39,784 --> 00:12:41,584
-Hi,dorie -Hi. 又一个dr. Shepherd.
- Another Dr. Shepherd? - He's my husband, actually.

295
00:12:41,584 --> 00:12:43,874
-事实上他是我的老公 -真的吗?
Seriously? Wow, look at you two. Everybody must hate you.

296
00:12:44,324 --> 00:12:46,594
哦,看看你们俩

297
00:12:46,594 --> 00:12:48,254
大家肯定都嫉妒你俩

298
00:12:48,254 --> 00:12:49,774
哦,你可不知道
[Both] You have no idea.

299
00:12:50,934 --> 00:12:51,834
dorie,
Anyway, Dorie, Dr. Shepherd wants to talk to you about Baby "C."

300
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:53,854
dr. Shepherd想和你谈谈婴儿c.

301
00:12:53,854 --> 00:12:57,044
-Lucy. -是的lucy有脑水肿
- Lucy. - Lucy has hydrocephalus.

302
00:12:57,044 --> 00:12:58,524
这因为累积了过多的
It is a build-up of cerebrospinal fluid on the brain.

303
00:12:58,524 --> 00:13:00,214
脑脊髓液而流到大脑形成的
OK, and that means...

304
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:02,094
好吧,那将意味着...
The fluid puts pressure on the baby's brain,

305
00:13:02,094 --> 00:13:03,184
过多的液体积聚而成

306
00:13:03,184 --> 00:13:04,774
然后压力推向婴儿的大脑
which could result in brain damage.

307
00:13:04,774 --> 00:13:06,384
这个能导致脑损伤

308
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:11,494
好消息是,我们发现的早
Here's the good news.

309
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,414
We caught it early. We can take care of it quickly.

310
00:13:11,494 --> 00:13:12,914
我们能很快的处理好这个
How?

311
00:13:12,914 --> 00:13:13,454
如何处理?
I'll install a shunt to drain the fluid.

312
00:13:13,454 --> 00:13:16,134
我将会做一个手术使液体排出

313
00:13:16,134 --> 00:13:16,964
没有任何并发症
You're looking at a full recovery.

314
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:18,454
而且你会完全康复
- No brain damage? - No brain damage.

315
00:13:18,454 --> 00:13:20,954
-没有脑损伤? -没有

316
00:13:21,794 --> 00:13:25,034
好的,真的...
OK, really, couldn't you have led with that?

317
00:13:25,034 --> 00:13:27,744
你就不能从好消息开始说吗?

318
00:13:28,414 --> 00:13:29,264
说的好.
Good point.

319
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,734
这是什么?
What the hell is this?

320
00:13:32,734 --> 00:13:34,224
钥匙
- It's a key. - Why?

321
00:13:34,224 --> 00:13:36,274
-为什么 -为什么是钥匙?
Why is it a key? Are we feeling existential this morning?

322
00:13:36,924 --> 00:13:38,924
我们今早讨论存在主义哲学了吗?

323
00:13:39,664 --> 00:13:42,944
如果一把钥匙打开一把锁,而没人要这把钥匙
If a key turns in a lock, and no one asked for the key or even wanted it,

324
00:13:42,944 --> 00:13:44,354
或者即使要这钥匙
does it make a sound?

325
00:13:44,354 --> 00:13:45,844
不会发出声音吗?
Hey.

326
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,184
Hi.

327
00:13:49,354 --> 00:13:51,354
我要把握这个机会
I'm going to take this opportunity to be someplace else.

328
00:13:51,354 --> 00:13:53,064
离开你

329
00:13:56,064 --> 00:13:58,724
-Steve的结果出来了,全部没问题 -如何?
- Steve's labs came back clean. - So?

330
00:13:58,724 --> 00:14:01,404
那么某人需要做血管收缩
So, someone needs to induce vasoconstriction.

331
00:14:01,584 --> 00:14:03,564
哦,真是有趣的词汇
Nice try with the fancy word. He needs an enema and the answer is "no."

332
00:14:03,564 --> 00:14:05,214
他需要灌肠,答案是不

333
00:14:06,034 --> 00:14:07,134
我不能做这个
I can't do it.

334
00:14:07,134 --> 00:14:07,894
哦算了吧
You let a guy you picked up in a bar see you naked

335
00:14:07,894 --> 00:14:10,444
你让一个从酒吧带回来的男子看你裸体

336
00:14:10,444 --> 00:14:12,964
-但是你不能帮他灌肠? -完全两码事
- and you can't give him an enema? - Uncalled for.

337
00:14:12,964 --> 00:14:14,994
我紧张而乖僻的.
- Well, I'm keyed up and cranky. - I'd do it for you.

338
00:14:14,994 --> 00:14:15,924
我会帮你做这个的
Oh, really? You'd give Burke an enema?

339
00:14:16,574 --> 00:14:19,724
是吗?你会帮burke灌肠?

340
00:14:19,724 --> 00:14:20,924
-是的 -是吗?
- Yes. - Uh-huh.

341
00:14:20,924 --> 00:14:21,644
-也许 -哦?
- Maybe. - Mm-hm.

342
00:14:21,644 --> 00:14:23,714
不会做,但是这不是重点
No. But that's not the point.

343
00:14:23,714 --> 00:14:25,484
Oh,yeah. Okay.不如这样
Oh, yeah. OK, here's how it goes.

344
00:14:25,484 --> 00:14:27,474
我帮你这次
I do this for you and you do every enema I'm assigned to for a month.

345
00:14:27,474 --> 00:14:30,794
-然后你帮我做这个月我所有分到的灌肠病人 -成交
Deal.

346
00:14:30,794 --> 00:14:32,474
看来你是真不想做这个啊
You really don't wanna do this.

347
00:14:37,224 --> 00:14:38,904
卖家中介那边有什么消息吗?
- Have we heard from the seller's agent? - I've been calling.

348
00:14:38,904 --> 00:14:40,044
我整个早上都在联系
Mr. Martin, it's good to see you back on solid ground. I'm Dr. Shepherd.

349
00:14:40,044 --> 00:14:42,864
Ah,mr. Rtin. 真高想看到你恢复正常

350
00:14:42,864 --> 00:14:45,774
-我是dr. Shepherd. -我的助手doyle ss
My assistant, Doyle, says I passed out and hit my head.

351
00:14:45,774 --> 00:14:47,114
我昏倒了而且撞了我的头
This guy says it's some kind of cyst.

352
00:14:47,324 --> 00:14:49,404
这家伙说什么囊肿.
- I want you to say when I can leave. - A Rathke's cleft cyst.

353
00:14:49,404 --> 00:14:52,754
-我想要你告诉我什么时候我可以出院 -早期裂口囊肿

354
00:14:52,754 --> 00:14:53,334
管他呢
- Whatever. - A congenital tumor on your pituitary.

355
00:14:53,334 --> 00:14:55,284
那是个先天瘤在你的垂体上
- Is it treatable? - You'll need surgery.

356
00:14:55,284 --> 00:14:57,694
-是可治愈的对吗? -你需要做手术

357
00:14:57,694 --> 00:14:59,774
我想要帮你做一个endonasal手术
- I'm gonna use an endonasal approach. - Endonasal?

358
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:00,914
Endonasal? Mm-hmm.
You're going to pull it out through my nose?

359
00:15:01,554 --> 00:15:03,254
-你要把那东西从我鼻子排出来? -是的

360
00:15:03,964 --> 00:15:05,734
查查他的声誉度
Look him up. Check his credentials.

361
00:15:05,734 --> 00:15:07,744
这是很小的入侵式手术
It's minimally invasive so there won't be scarring.

362
00:15:07,744 --> 00:15:11,004
-所以不会有任何疤痕留下 -很好,那么什么时候?
- Good. So, when? - When we stabilize your sodium levels.

363
00:15:11,004 --> 00:15:13,074
一旦我们完全稳定住你的钠指数的时候
- That means no more water. - I'm thirsty.

364
00:15:13,074 --> 00:15:15,474
-那意味着不能喝过多的水 -我渴

365
00:15:15,474 --> 00:15:17,244
这是脑瘤的副作用
It's a side effect. We'll keep you hydrated intravenously.

366
00:15:17,244 --> 00:15:18,444
我们会保持你的液体经脉注射
OK?

367
00:15:18,444 --> 00:15:19,634
Right. Okay?

368
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,614
你tmd觉得自己在干吗?
What the hell are you doing?

369
00:15:23,614 --> 00:15:25,744
我只是按照医生的嘱咐.
I'm just following the doctor's orders.

370
00:15:31,904 --> 00:15:33,804
我无法相信这个要发生
- I cannot believe this is happening. - Try being me.

371
00:15:33,804 --> 00:15:35,414
试着以我的角度想想
I mean, you meet someone in a bar, you have a few drinks, a few laughs,

372
00:15:35,414 --> 00:15:36,854
我是说,你在酒吧遇到某人

373
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:39,084
你喝了一些酒,讲了一些笑话

374
00:15:39,084 --> 00:15:40,354
在车里做爱
- you make out in the car... - Roll over to your side.

375
00:15:40,354 --> 00:15:42,494
翻过去你那边,另外一边
Other side.

376
00:15:44,814 --> 00:15:46,354
把你的膝盖抬到前胸上来
- Bring your knees up to your chest. - You have a good time.

377
00:15:46,354 --> 00:15:47,484
你过了段快乐时光.
Spend the night, wake up the next morning and...

378
00:15:47,484 --> 00:15:50,294
黑夜放纵,早上醒来

379
00:15:50,294 --> 00:15:51,444
然后... okay!
- OK! - Mm-hm.

380
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:56,477
<i>[Woman on PA]</i>

381
00:16:01,684 --> 00:16:03,104
你还不和我说话吗?
- Still not talking to me? - You gave me syphilis.

382
00:16:03,104 --> 00:16:04,304
你把梅毒传给我

383
00:16:05,204 --> 00:16:06,474
而且我在和你说话了
And I am talking to you. I just don't have anything to say.

384
00:16:06,474 --> 00:16:07,634
我只是没话可说

385
00:16:11,254 --> 00:16:12,624
george怎么样了?
- How's George? - O'Malley's a fetus.

386
00:16:12,914 --> 00:16:14,144
O'malley是婴儿
He's all whiny and afraid of the light.

387
00:16:14,144 --> 00:16:15,974
他总是嘀咕不停,而且害怕灯光

388
00:16:16,754 --> 00:16:19,074
你没告诉他我和你上床了,这是个大事情
So you didn't tell him you were doing me. Big deal.

389
00:16:19,074 --> 00:16:21,514
最小的暴露,这是我的政策
Minimal disclosure, that's my policy.

390
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:30,504
Hey. 我到处找你呢
Hey. I've been looking for you.

391
00:16:30,504 --> 00:16:31,234
Hey.
Hey.

392
00:16:32,004 --> 00:16:33,304
我在跟着那五胞胎的病例
- I'm on the quints case. - Yeah, I heard.

393
00:16:33,304 --> 00:16:34,274
我听说了
They'll need multiple surgeries.

394
00:16:34,524 --> 00:16:35,284
是啊,他们需要
I put you on the pager list. So you're in too.

395
00:16:35,284 --> 00:16:36,714
多重手术,一旦他们生下来

396
00:16:36,714 --> 00:16:39,034
我把你的名字写在外援名单里了,那么你也会加入的
Yeah, I kind of got my own cases to worry about, so...

397
00:16:39,034 --> 00:16:40,864
是啊,我还有我自己的病人

398
00:16:40,864 --> 00:16:41,964
来担心照顾,所以...

399
00:16:42,744 --> 00:16:46,234
okay,alex... 是我吗?
OK, Alex, was it me?

400
00:16:46,234 --> 00:16:49,874
因为我们看起来应该有段正常的时光
Because we seemed to be actually having a normal time, a good time.

401
00:16:49,874 --> 00:16:50,944
快乐的时光.
Yeah, we were having a good time.

402
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:52,454
是啊,我们的确过的很愉快
Well, then, was it me? Was it something I did?

403
00:16:52,874 --> 00:16:56,574
那么是因为我吗?是因为我做了什么或者...

404
00:16:56,574 --> 00:16:58,104
听着,不是因为你,好吗?
It wasn't you, OK? It was just...

405
00:16:58,104 --> 00:16:59,024
是因为...
Look, I didn't feel like doing it. I was tired, you know.

406
00:16:59,544 --> 00:17:01,434
我只是不想做那个而已

407
00:17:01,434 --> 00:17:02,874
我很累,你知道?

408
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,914
那么你今晚想做吗?
Well, do you feel like doing it tonight?

409
00:17:07,634 --> 00:17:09,194
恩...
[Short laugh]

410
00:17:10,174 --> 00:17:11,554
我今晚值班,那么...
- I'm on call, so... - [short laugh]

411
00:17:12,654 --> 00:17:14,314
好吧...
OK. Well, do you feel like doing it now?

412
00:17:15,554 --> 00:17:17,374
你想现在做吗?

413
00:17:19,584 --> 00:17:20,754
什么,现在?
Right now?

414
00:17:20,754 --> 00:17:22,934
好多人都在这医院里做爱
People have sex in this hospital all the time.

415
00:17:37,504 --> 00:17:38,644
听说那五胞胎了吗
- You hear about the quints? - Yeah, I heard.

416
00:17:38,644 --> 00:17:40,944
恩,听说了

417
00:17:40,944 --> 00:17:42,904
恩,我要参加那手术
I gotta get in on that.

418
00:17:42,904 --> 00:17:44,864
是啊,那是addison的.
Yeah, well, that's Addison, so I'm guessing I don't stand a chance.

419
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:46,274
所以我猜我是不会被选中的.

420
00:17:49,124 --> 00:17:51,024
你是如何弄坏那家伙的小弟弟的?
So how do you break a guy's penis?

421
00:17:52,254 --> 00:17:55,494
你知道steve?
You know about Steve?

422
00:17:56,344 --> 00:17:58,004
为什么我遇到的每个人
Why does every guy I meet

423
00:17:58,004 --> 00:18:01,254
都有着与众不同的恶梦似的羞辱?
come with his own unique set of nightmarish humiliations?

424
00:18:02,244 --> 00:18:04,204
也许是因为量?
- Maybe it's a matter of volume. - Volume? What's that supposed to mean?

425
00:18:04,204 --> 00:18:06,374
量? 你什么意思?
I'm just... There's quality and then there's quantity.

426
00:18:06,374 --> 00:18:09,554
只是,你知道,质量和数量

427
00:18:09,554 --> 00:18:11,524
你的意思是我和太多的男人上床了?
So, you think I'm sleeping with too many guys? You think I'm some kind of slut?

428
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:13,594
你认为我是什么荡妇?
I think you are taking some risks.

429
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:14,744
我认为你在冒险.
I think you'll find yourself in some guy's basement

430
00:18:15,374 --> 00:18:18,374
我认为你会在什么人的地下室的角落里找到你自己

431
00:18:18,374 --> 00:18:19,694
正被安排着,在皮肤上涂满乳液
being ordered to do things or you'll get the hose again.

432
00:18:19,694 --> 00:18:21,554
-或者你又穿上一双长筒袜 -别说了
- Come on. - I'm talking.

433
00:18:21,554 --> 00:18:22,484
我认为...对不起我还没说完
So you're not over Derek. You want to be, but you're not.

434
00:18:22,484 --> 00:18:25,744
所以你并没有忘记derek.你想忘记,但是你没有

435
00:18:25,744 --> 00:18:28,004
你在试着找某些代替品
You're trying to find a replacement, a way to feel better.

436
00:18:28,004 --> 00:18:29,404
某些暂时性的解决方法来让自己感觉好过些
But it's not going to work because a future of meaningless one-night stands

437
00:18:29,404 --> 00:18:31,214
但是并没有成功,而且也不会成功

438
00:18:31,214 --> 00:18:33,654
因为一场无意义的一夜情的未来

439
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,744
或者有问题的小弟弟,都不是你想要的东西
and problematic penises is not what you want.

440
00:18:36,964 --> 00:18:39,124
你要的是更好的
You want better, and you deserve better.

441
00:18:39,124 --> 00:18:40,354
而且你值得更好的

442
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,144
不是所有人都是个恶梦
And not every guy is a nightmare.

443
00:18:51,204 --> 00:18:53,814
如果是我的原因,告诉我是因为我
- If it's me, just tell me it's me. - It's not you.

444
00:18:53,814 --> 00:18:54,534
并不是你
Well, then is it a medical thing, or a problem?

445
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:57,234
那么是医学的问题了

446
00:18:57,234 --> 00:18:58,984
或者.. 或者什么疾病?
Because guys have problems sometimes.

447
00:18:58,984 --> 00:19:01,054
因为男人有时候有问题

448
00:19:01,054 --> 00:19:02,974
我没病.
I don't have a problem.

449
00:19:04,024 --> 00:19:05,154
回来
Get back down here. We're gonna do this until we do it.

450
00:19:05,154 --> 00:19:07,114
我们继续做,直到做成了为止

451
00:19:07,984 --> 00:19:08,774
好吧
OK.

452
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,973
[Giggles]

453
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:16,878
[Giggles]

454
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,881
<i>[Pager beeps]</i>

455
00:19:21,084 --> 00:19:25,754
Oh...9-1-1. 对不起

456
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:25,255
911. I'm sorry.

457
00:19:28,844 --> 00:19:29,784
该死
Damn it.

458
00:19:40,134 --> 00:19:41,094
你去哪里了?
- Where have you been? - I um... I... The nurse was here.

459
00:19:41,094 --> 00:19:43,424
我...

460
00:19:43,424 --> 00:19:45,114
护士在这里呢
I've loaded her up with magnesium. Start monitoring her for toxicity.

461
00:19:46,114 --> 00:19:47,674
我放了一些镁在这里

462
00:19:47,674 --> 00:19:49,064
然后开始监视她的毒性测试
It's too soon. They can't come yet.

463
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:52,544
哦,太快了,他们不能出来

464
00:19:53,374 --> 00:19:55,114
妈妈说graham开始呕吐了
Mom says Graham started puking.

465
00:19:56,084 --> 00:19:57,634
这是什么?怎么了?
What is it? What's going on?

466
00:19:57,634 --> 00:20:00,804
Dorie开始宫缩,婴儿们的情况稳定
- She's having contractions. - Vital signs are stable.

467
00:20:00,804 --> 00:20:02,074
但是你的胎盘下垂
Your placenta is laying low. We'll keep an eye on that.

468
00:20:02,074 --> 00:20:03,724
我们会继续观察
We want them in there longer.

469
00:20:03,724 --> 00:20:05,434
我们想要这些孩子尽可能久的留在子宫里
How, if she's already having contractions?

470
00:20:05,434 --> 00:20:07,634
如果她开始宫缩的话如何留着他们?

471
00:20:07,634 --> 00:20:09,364
没关系,亲爱的,他们可以做到
They can stop them. You're going to Trendelenburg me, right?

472
00:20:09,364 --> 00:20:11,074
你要帮我做trendelenberg,对吗?
Yes, I am. You've done your reading, Dorie.

473
00:20:11,074 --> 00:20:14,194
是的我会的,你读了好多相关材料,dorie.

474
00:20:14,194 --> 00:20:15,624
他们对三胞胎也是这样做的
I did it with the triplets.

475
00:20:15,624 --> 00:20:17,844
重力,记得吗,tom?
Gravity, remember, Tom?

476
00:20:17,844 --> 00:20:20,794
那时候就做的很好,现在也会没事的
It worked fine then and it'll be fine now.

477
00:20:20,794 --> 00:20:21,954
继续犹豫吧,tom.
Hang in there, Tom. No time for second thoughts now.

478
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:23,414
现在甚至没有一秒钟可让你思考
We didn't think that we'd survive a week with the boys, and we did.

479
00:20:23,414 --> 00:20:26,334
我们第一周的时候都没想过可以和孩子们一起活下来

480
00:20:26,334 --> 00:20:28,084
但是我们挺过来了,而现在我们会和女儿们再次活下来的
We'll be the same with the girls. We're ready.

481
00:20:28,084 --> 00:20:29,534
准备好了

482
00:20:30,474 --> 00:20:33,384
这就是我们现在所能做的
[Sighs]

483
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:35,225
That's all we can do for now. Dr. Stevens, are you on call tonight?

484
00:20:33,384 --> 00:20:35,904
Dr. Stevens,你今晚值班吗?

485
00:20:35,904 --> 00:20:37,184
不是
- No. - You are now.

486
00:20:37,184 --> 00:20:38,194
你现在是了

487
00:20:48,354 --> 00:20:49,634
灌肠不起作用.
- Enema didn't work. - Enema didn't work?

488
00:20:49,634 --> 00:20:52,674
灌肠不起作用?灌肠不起作用
Enema didn't work.

489
00:20:52,674 --> 00:20:55,814
那可是个非常棒的灌肠
Huh.

490
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,116
- It was an excellent enema. - So, what's the next step?

491
00:20:55,814 --> 00:20:57,924
下一步该怎么办?
A needle aspiration.

492
00:20:57,924 --> 00:20:59,064
扎针

493
00:21:00,274 --> 00:21:01,044
扎针?
A needle? My penis?

494
00:21:01,044 --> 00:21:02,354
我的小弟弟?
We have to drain the blood.

495
00:21:02,354 --> 00:21:04,064
我们需要放血

496
00:21:06,434 --> 00:21:08,414
不可以,绝对不行,算了吧
No way! No! Forget it!

497
00:21:08,414 --> 00:21:10,994
那么你就会阳痿,
Then you're looking at impotence, penile infarction, or gangrene.

498
00:21:10,994 --> 00:21:13,164
阴茎僵死或者腐败
- So if you want it to fall off... - No. No, I really don't want that.

499
00:21:13,164 --> 00:21:14,404
如果你想它倒下来...

500
00:21:14,404 --> 00:21:16,534
不,不,我真的不想要这个

501
00:21:16,534 --> 00:21:19,664
那么让我们开始吧,什么让它起来,一定会有东西让它倒下的
Then let's get to it. What goes up must come down.

502
00:21:19,664 --> 00:21:21,354
我感觉恶心
- I feel nauseous. - [Blows]

503
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:25,064
往后躺,闭上眼睛,试着放松自己
Just lie back, close your eyes, and try to relax.

504
00:21:25,064 --> 00:21:27,094
如果我能放松的话,我就不会在这里了
If I could relax, I wouldn't be here!

505
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,943
[Woman] Doctor.

506
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:32,224
他怎么样了?
How is he?

507
00:21:32,694 --> 00:21:34,904
手术排到明天了,所以..
- Surgery's scheduled for tomorrow. - Anything I can do?

508
00:21:34,904 --> 00:21:36,084
还有什么需要我做的吗?
Don't let him drink any water. Even if he begs.

509
00:21:36,084 --> 00:21:38,194
别让他喝水,即使他恳求

510
00:21:38,194 --> 00:21:40,784
有什么家人需要我们联络的吗,朋友?  没有
Any family we should contact?

511
00:21:40,784 --> 00:21:43,634
他不太擅长和其他人相处
- No. - Friends?

512
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:44,263
He doesn't get on with most people. Not big on social skills.

513
00:21:43,634 --> 00:21:45,544
不太擅长社交   悲哀的家伙
- Sad guy. - Well, he has me.

514
00:21:45,544 --> 00:21:48,194
他有我,3年的助手
Three years as his assistant. I guess I'm his friend.

515
00:21:48,194 --> 00:21:50,034
我猜我是他的朋友
Doyle!

516
00:21:50,034 --> 00:21:50,834
Doyle!

517
00:21:58,914 --> 00:22:00,354
如果我把钥匙还给你会怎样?
What if I just give him back the key?

518
00:22:01,504 --> 00:22:04,444
他会很难过   那如果我根本不用呢?
- He'll be hurt. - What if I don't use it?

519
00:22:04,444 --> 00:22:06,864
这样说来,如果你没有想过要用它
If you had no intention of using it, you shouldn't have taken it.

520
00:22:06,864 --> 00:22:08,044
你就跟本不该拿走它
Come on. Fishing a key out of a cup isn't like some binding legal contract.

521
00:22:08,044 --> 00:22:09,174
算了你

522
00:22:09,174 --> 00:22:10,484
从咖啡杯里钓上来一把钥匙

523
00:22:10,484 --> 00:22:13,614
会不会像是什么法律约束的契约?

524
00:22:13,614 --> 00:22:15,744
你男朋友把他家钥匙给你了?
Your boyfriend gave you a key to his place?

525
00:22:16,694 --> 00:22:17,704
他为什么会说话?
Why's he talking?

526
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:18,854
我只是说说
The guy put himself out. He's taking the next step. You can't not use it.

527
00:22:18,854 --> 00:22:21,444
一个男人都做了这些了,就是打算好下一步该怎么办了

528
00:22:21,444 --> 00:22:22,784
你不能不用
Do you think you might not be in the best position right now

529
00:22:22,784 --> 00:22:26,444
你有想过你此时此刻并不是什么好姿势

530
00:22:26,444 --> 00:22:28,064
来建议我如何处理感情吗?
to be handing out relationship advice?

531
00:22:28,064 --> 00:22:31,594
他把钥匙给你了,你带走了
Hey, he offered the key, you took the key.

532
00:22:31,594 --> 00:22:33,054
只是因为我...
Just because I'm...

533
00:22:33,054 --> 00:22:34,944
快看啊
Look at that!

534
00:22:36,744 --> 00:22:38,164
恭喜
Congratulations. You're flaccid.

535
00:22:38,164 --> 00:22:39,444
你软下来了

536
00:22:40,784 --> 00:22:43,104
从没想过我是如此高兴听到这句话
Never thought I'd be so happy to hear that.

537
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:49,031
<i>[Man on PA] Dr jones to Radiology.</i> <i>Dr jones to Radiology.</i>

538
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:50,625
Dorie? Tom?

539
00:22:53,754 --> 00:22:55,224
Hey,dorie,tom,
Hey, Dorie. Tom, this is Dr. Burke, he's the head of cardiothoracic surgery,

540
00:22:55,224 --> 00:22:56,134
这是dr. Burke.

541
00:22:56,134 --> 00:22:57,944
他是心胸外科主任
and Dr. O'Malley, who'll be assisting him.

542
00:22:57,944 --> 00:23:00,094
以及帮助他的dr. O'malley

543
00:23:00,094 --> 00:23:02,984
Dr. Burke想和你聊聊关于emily的心脏手术
Dr. Burke wanted to talk about Emily's heart surgery.

544
00:23:02,984 --> 00:23:04,714
Emily需要心脏手术? 是的
- Heart surgery? - Yes.

545
00:23:04,714 --> 00:23:06,344
你的女儿得了一种叫做
She has a condition called hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

546
00:23:06,344 --> 00:23:09,644
左心室发育不全的综合症.这个手术就是要扩大它
The surgery will be extensive, and the odds are...

547
00:23:09,644 --> 00:23:10,854
而成败几率是...
- We don't believe in odds. - Good. Neither do I.

548
00:23:10,854 --> 00:23:14,004
我们不相信几率.   很好,我也不信

549
00:23:14,004 --> 00:23:16,034
但是重要的是你们都明白
But it's important that you understand medically what's going on.

550
00:23:16,034 --> 00:23:17,794
在你们女儿身上发生的医学转变
After she's born, there won't be much time to ask questions.

551
00:23:17,794 --> 00:23:20,504
她出生之后,就没有时间再问问题了,所以...

552
00:23:20,504 --> 00:23:21,334
okay.
OK.

553
00:23:22,244 --> 00:23:24,234
我们在听.
- We're listening. - What's wrong with Emily's heart?

554
00:23:24,234 --> 00:23:26,224
emily的心脏怎么了?
The left-side chambers are underdeveloped.

555
00:23:26,224 --> 00:23:29,054
左侧的心室是发育不完全的

556
00:23:29,054 --> 00:23:30,554
而且,用来连接两个心室的
And the mitral valve, which connects these chambers, is abnormally narrow.

557
00:23:30,554 --> 00:23:32,104
二尖瓣

558
00:23:32,104 --> 00:23:33,364
