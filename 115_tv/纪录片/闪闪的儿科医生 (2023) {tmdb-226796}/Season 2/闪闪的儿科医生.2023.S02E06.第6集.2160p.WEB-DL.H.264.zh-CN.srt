00:00:01,522 --> 00:00:04,182
前情提要
<i>[Narrator] Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

3
00:00:04,182 --> 00:00:05,602
你到底怎么回事？
What is going on with you?

4
00:00:05,612 --> 00:00:06,632
医院同意了你可以
We grant you four months to retake the medical board exam.

5
00:00:06,662 --> 00:00:08,982
四个月后补考临床医理

6
00:00:09,002 --> 00:00:12,342
Karev,接着解剖刀. Alex! 接啊!
- Karev, take the scalpel. - Alex, come on.

7
00:00:12,372 --> 00:00:16,042
你的选择? 非常简单，她还是我.
Your choice. It's simple. Her or me.

8
00:00:16,062 --> 00:00:17,772
Addison是我的家人. 然后有一天,
Addison is my family. I'm supposed to sign a piece of paper and end my family?

9
00:00:17,802 --> 00:00:19,922
我需要签一张纸 来断绝和家人的关系?

10
00:00:19,952 --> 00:00:21,502
你要和那个人约会? 那是我老公.
- Your date? - My husband.

11
00:00:21,532 --> 00:00:23,552
你已经结婚了? 今天整整10年.
- You're married? - Ten years today.

12
00:00:23,592 --> 00:00:25,202
Burke想和我确立关系
Burke wants a relationship.

13
00:00:25,232 --> 00:00:27,022
Okay,我们是一对了.
OK. We're a couple.

14
00:00:27,092 --> 00:00:30,092
那么选我. 要我.
So pick me. Choose me. Love me.

15
00:00:30,192 --> 00:00:32,852
爱我. 我今晚会在Joe的酒吧.
I'll be at Joe's tonight. If you decide to sign the papers, meet me there.

16
00:00:32,852 --> 00:00:36,982
如果你决定签那张纸了 过来找我.

17
00:00:37,002 --> 00:00:38,692
告诉我，该怎么办.
Tell me what to do.

18
00:00:47,632 --> 00:00:49,562
我竟然说了 "选我."
I actually said "Pick me." Right? I did? "Pick me"?

19
00:00:49,592 --> 00:00:51,932
对吗? 我说了? "选我"?

20
00:00:51,962 --> 00:00:54,802
-我觉得这挺浪漫的. -一点也不浪漫,joe.
- I think it's romantic. - It's not romantic, it's horrifying.

21
00:00:54,832 --> 00:00:55,942
那是恐怖.
Horror movie horrifying. Carrie at the prom with the pig's blood horrifying.

22
00:00:55,962 --> 00:00:57,572
恐怖片的恐怖情节. （恐怖片《Carrie》）

23
00:00:57,592 --> 00:01:00,192
就像Carrie在一场舞会上 满身猪血的恐怖.

24
00:01:00,212 --> 00:01:02,252
Okay,好吧, 的确恐怖.
OK, fine, it's horrifying.

25
00:01:02,252 --> 00:01:06,082
但是作为报复， Carrie带走了所有高年级生.
But Carrie took out an entire senior class as revenge.

26
00:01:06,092 --> 00:01:08,052
我必须承认 我就喜欢那种姑娘.
Gotta say, I like that in a girl.

27
00:01:08,082 --> 00:01:10,432
我说了 "选我."
I said "Pick me."

28
00:01:10,472 --> 00:01:12,482
当你告诉某人我晚一些时候 会在酒吧等你,
When you say "I'll meet you later"

29
00:01:12,502 --> 00:01:15,602
到底意味着你会等多久?
how long does that mean you should wait?

30
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:18,210
- Do you think he's really not coming? - It is getting a little hard to watch.

31
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:17,702
你认为他真的不会来吗?

32
00:01:17,732 --> 00:01:19,402
即使在这里看着都有点难
It was hard to watch an hour ago. Now it's pathetic.

33
00:01:19,432 --> 00:01:22,872
一个钟头前就够难了 现在不过是可悲而已.

34
00:01:23,172 --> 00:01:25,292
谁可悲?
Who's pathetic?

35
00:01:26,342 --> 00:01:26,882
什么?
- What? - You, who pretend to be my friends,

36
00:01:26,922 --> 00:01:29,602
你们应该算是我的朋友吧

37
00:01:29,632 --> 00:01:32,852
竟然说我可悲? 在我背后
are calling me pathetic behind my back in front of my face.

38
00:01:32,882 --> 00:01:34,502
在我面前.
Why don't you just dump the pig's blood on me now and get it over with?

39
00:01:34,532 --> 00:01:36,612
为什么你们不把猪血倒我身上

40
00:01:36,652 --> 00:01:39,012
你们不就完成任务了吗?

41
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,128
<i>[Beeping]</i>

42
00:01:45,002 --> 00:01:47,542
看来他真不会来了.
He's really not coming.

43
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:48,130
<i>[Beeping]</i>

44
00:01:50,412 --> 00:01:52,382
Joe,把电视声音调大些.
[Man] Joe, turn up the TV.

45
00:01:52,492 --> 00:01:53,502
(女主播) 一场大规模的火车失事
<i>[TV] A massive train wreck occurred</i> <i>just outside Seattle minutes ago.</i>

46
00:01:53,542 --> 00:01:55,712
几分钟前发生在西雅图近郊

47
00:01:55,742 --> 00:01:58,442
911? 我们刚刚工作了30个钟头啊.
- 911. - We just worked a 30-hour shift.

48
00:01:58,472 --> 00:02:00,512
我都没有干净的内裤穿了
- I don't have any clean underwear. - [They sigh]

49
00:02:01,372 --> 00:02:02,352
vancouver驶来的火车
<i>The Vancouver-bound train</i> <i>was carrying 300 passengers.</i>

50
00:02:02,392 --> 00:02:04,492
满载300名乘客
- Looks ugly. - <i>Paramedics are helping victims.</i>

51
00:02:04,522 --> 00:02:07,312
看起来真糟糕. 救护人员正在现场帮助救治伤者

52
00:02:07,352 --> 00:02:09,842
你要走了? 不不不,你不能走.
You're leaving? No, you can't leave.

53
00:02:09,882 --> 00:02:12,562
对不起.我要去帮助其他人的"火车失事"了.
Sorry, gotta go tend to someone else's train wreck.

54
00:02:12,582 --> 00:02:14,832
你至少要留下来再喝杯咖啡
You gotta at least stay for a cup of coffee.

55
00:02:14,832 --> 00:02:16,592
你现在绝对不适合给别人开刀.
You're in no shape to cut people open. I want to hear the ending.

56
00:02:16,612 --> 00:02:18,802
另外,我不想错过大结局.
Meredith?

57
00:02:19,032 --> 00:02:19,972
Meredith?
Maybe it's for the best. Maybe I don't want to know.

58
00:02:20,532 --> 00:02:23,172
也许现在就是最好的结局了. 也许我根本不想知道结局如何
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

59
00:02:23,272 --> 00:02:25,662
这是我从来没听过的最愚蠢的说法.

60
00:02:25,752 --> 00:02:26,472
(meredith) 大致来说,
- <i>[Meredith] In general...</i> - Bye, Joe.

61
00:02:28,182 --> 00:02:30,922
人可以被划分为2种类型...
<i>...people can be categorized</i> <i>in one of two ways.</i>

62
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:31,940
[Man] He was in the front of the train.

63
00:02:33,282 --> 00:02:35,322
一种是喜欢突发事件的
<i>Those who love surprises,</i> <i>and those who don't.</i>

64
00:02:36,042 --> 00:02:38,112
以及另外一种不喜欢的.

65
00:02:39,032 --> 00:02:39,742
我...
<i>I don't.</i>

66
00:02:40,102 --> 00:02:41,372
不喜欢.

67
00:02:47,192 --> 00:02:48,532
(女主播) 一个损坏的发动机部件

68
00:02:48,562 --> 00:02:50,062
在火车离开车站的两小时前得到确认

69
00:02:50,362 --> 00:02:51,582
但却致使火车准时出发.
Dude, you're late.

70
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:52,712
伙计,
<i>[TV] Once again, a massive train wreck</i> <i>occurred outside of Seattle minutes ago.</i>

71
00:02:52,762 --> 00:02:54,322
你迟到了.

72
00:02:59,092 --> 00:03:01,832
我从没遇到过一个外科医生是喜欢突发事件的
<i>[Meredith] I've never met a surgeon</i> <i>that enjoys a surprise,</i>

73
00:03:01,862 --> 00:03:05,312
因为做为医生, 我们更喜欢了解全局.
<i>because, as surgeons,</i> <i>we like to be in the know.</i>

74
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,022
我们必须要了解全局.
<i>We have to be in the know.</i>

75
00:03:07,042 --> 00:03:10,372
因为有时候, 当我们无法了解全局时,
<i>Because when we aren't,</i> <i>people die and lawsuits happen.</i>

76
00:03:11,002 --> 00:03:13,622
患者死亡 然后官司就跟着来了.
<i>Am I rambling? I think I'm rambling.</i>

77
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:19,642
我散漫吗? 我觉得我挺散漫的.
[Cristina] I think I saw a pneumothorax. I hope I get a pneumothorax.

78
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,060
- Hey. - Thought you weren't talking to me.

79
00:03:20,802 --> 00:03:22,062
我好像看到了一个气胸患者. 真希望能分到一个气胸的.
Thought you needed a friend, so I'm rising above.

80
00:03:22,092 --> 00:03:22,122
我以为你再也不理我了

81
00:03:22,152 --> 00:03:25,492
-我以为你只是把我当朋友 所以我也就只把你当朋友而已. -那么为什么你这样认为呢?

82
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,399
- Why would you think that? - Because you freaked out.

83
00:03:25,522 --> 00:03:27,382
因为你在电梯里吓傻了?
- I did not. - Missed out on open-heart surgery.

84
00:03:27,402 --> 00:03:29,252
-我才没吓傻呢. -失去了一个表演心脏手术的机会?

85
00:03:29,272 --> 00:03:31,302
O'malley只不过用手指堵住了洞而已
- O'Malley plugged the hole. - I thought you needed to talk.

86
00:03:31,332 --> 00:03:32,922
-我以为你会找什么人聊聊 -我没有想过.
- Well, I don't. - To someone who cares about you.

87
00:03:32,952 --> 00:03:35,722
-找个真正关心你的人聊聊 -谢谢你的关心,但是我不需要

88
00:03:38,162 --> 00:03:41,302
Wow. 你们看什么呢?
- What are you looking at? - Is that a dress?

89
00:03:41,342 --> 00:03:43,012
什么也没看. Oh,没什么.
Nothing. What?

90
00:03:43,072 --> 00:03:45,952
Hey,你, 去把的鞋拿来.
Go get me my damn shoes.

91
00:03:45,952 --> 00:03:46,912
这里.
Let's move, people.

92
00:03:47,192 --> 00:03:48,532
大家动起来.

93
00:03:50,422 --> 00:03:51,212
Hello.
Hello. I seem to be a little bit drunk. I was off duty.

94
00:03:51,762 --> 00:03:53,752
我看起来有点醉了

95
00:03:54,202 --> 00:03:55,382
今天我不值班.
So was I. Anybody else half in the bottle?

96
00:03:55,512 --> 00:03:58,102
我也不值班. 还有人喝了半瓶以上酒的吗?

97
00:03:58,142 --> 00:03:59,322
Uh,no. No.
- No. - [Bailey] All right then.

98
00:03:59,432 --> 00:04:00,282
那么好吧.
Stay out of the way. I'll deal with you later.

99
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:02,202
Grey,站旁边去吧. 我过会儿再处理你.
The rest, stick with me and wait for assignments.

100
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,932
其他人跟着我来 等我给你们分配工作.

101
00:04:04,972 --> 00:04:07,452
我知道当你们看到鲜血和脏器 的时候激动的浑身颤抖,
I know you get all a-quiver at the sight of blood,

102
00:04:07,502 --> 00:04:09,412
但是这个将持续整夜 而你们已经很累了.
but it'll be a long night and you're tired. I want no mistakes. Come on.

103
00:04:09,452 --> 00:04:11,452
我不希望你们犯任何错误. 快点啊!
I'm done. Done.

104
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,617
[Patient groaning]

105
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,882
<i>[Monitors beep]</i>

106
00:04:18,482 --> 00:04:20,952
-我一点一点也不累了. -我也不,一点也不累.
- I'm so not tired anymore. - Me neither.

107
00:04:24,002 --> 00:04:25,782
我这里有一个三度烧伤患者
I've got a third-trimester burn victim here. I'll need some help.

108
00:04:25,802 --> 00:04:27,412
Bailey医生,我需要帮忙
- Izzie, go. - Yes. Have a nice nap.

109
00:04:27,592 --> 00:04:29,662
Uh,izzie,去吧.

110
00:04:29,722 --> 00:04:32,042
Yes! 睡个好觉!

111
00:04:32,637 --> 00:04:35,217
有宫缩了吗? 没有.
- Have you had any contractions? - No.

112
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:39,740
Hey. Joe told me to tell you that McSteamy came looking for you.

113
00:04:38,267 --> 00:04:42,187
-joe让我告诉你,"美闷先生"过去找你来着 -你是说"美梦先生"

114
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:43,407
You mean McDreamy? Joe said McDreamy came looking for me?

115
00:04:42,207 --> 00:04:44,137
Joe说"美梦先生"去找我了?
No, I'm pretty sure it was McSteamy. Yeah. Yeah.

116
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:46,627
No,我很确定是"美闷先生".

117
00:04:47,267 --> 00:04:48,027
Yeah.

118
00:04:48,437 --> 00:04:49,387
Yeah.

119
00:04:57,037 --> 00:04:58,657
Shepherd医生,能看看这个吗?
Dr. Shepherd, could you take a look at this?

120
00:05:00,537 --> 00:05:01,357
这是意味着他选她了吗?
Does that mean he picked her?

121
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:04,957
如果是的话,我刚刚输了50块钱
If it does, I just lost 50 bucks.

122
00:05:05,617 --> 00:05:06,807
腿来了!
Got the leg!

123
00:05:09,157 --> 00:05:12,337
-我要那条腿! -他在现场就大量失血.
- I want that leg. - He lost a lot of blood at the scene.

124
00:05:12,367 --> 00:05:16,207
-伤口已经止血了, 两个注射针头已经插入动脉了. -给什么止痛的了吗?
Pressure dressings applied, two large-bore IVs started.

125
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,977
- Anything for pain? - Morphine. Five migs given so far.

126
00:05:16,237 --> 00:05:18,637
基本用量的吗啡,现在为止给了5毫克了

127
00:05:18,907 --> 00:05:20,227
Bailey医生, 你那有谁?
Dr. Bailey, who you got?

128
00:05:20,297 --> 00:05:21,707
Oh! Oh!

129
00:05:21,827 --> 00:05:22,687
Cristina,去.

130
00:05:24,717 --> 00:05:26,997
-取消其他一切伤患,预约一个手术室 -Yes,sir.
Rule out other injuries and book an OR.

131
00:05:27,017 --> 00:05:29,407
-Webber医生. -我们有个火车失事,derek.
- Dr. Webber? - We have a train wreck, Derek.

132
00:05:29,427 --> 00:05:31,747
我们需要全部人手 所以现在就帮我做清理手术
We need all hands on deck. Clear me for surgery or you're fired.

133
00:05:31,767 --> 00:05:33,267
-否则你就下岗. -今天头疼了吗?
- Any headaches today? - No.

134
00:05:33,297 --> 00:05:35,367
-没有. -眩晕?恶心?视力模糊?

135
00:05:35,397 --> 00:05:38,837
-没有没有就没有. 现在别档着我的路. -好吧,那我跟你一起去.

136
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:40,600
Fine. But I'm coming with you. Or I'm fired. Up to you.

137
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:41,047
或者我下岗,你决定.

139
00:05:49,127 --> 00:05:51,147
-他是对你点头了吗? -是
- Was that a nod? - Yes.

140
00:05:51,247 --> 00:05:53,397
-我们知道那是什么意思吗? -不知道
- Do we know what it meant? - No.

我是隐形人吗?
Am I invisible?

142
00:05:56,567 --> 00:05:59,627
Okay, 其实我要说的重点是,
<i>[Meredith] OK, so my point actually,</i> <i>and I do have one,</i>

143
00:05:59,647 --> 00:06:01,277
我的确是有重点的
<i>has nothing to do with surprises</i> <i>or death or lawsuits or even surgeons.</i>

144
00:06:01,307 --> 00:06:03,127
对待突发事件,我们无计可施

145
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:06,847
或者死亡或者吃官司 即使是医生也无法避免.

146
00:06:06,887 --> 00:06:09,397
我想说的是... 某人说过
<i>My point is this; whoever said,</i> <i>"What you don't know can't hurt you"</i>

147
00:06:09,447 --> 00:06:11,777
"未知的事物是无法伤害你的"

148
00:06:11,867 --> 00:06:14,097
真是个宇宙超级无敌大白痴
<i>was a complete and total moron.</i>

149
00:06:14,127 --> 00:06:16,387
因为就大多数我认识的人来说,
<i>Because for most people I know,</i>

150
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:19,777
一无所知是世界上第一糟糕的事情了
<i>not knowing</i> <i>is the worst feeling in the world.</i>

151
00:06:27,427 --> 00:06:29,167
Okay,算了.
<i>OK, fine, maybe it's the second worst.</i>

152
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:31,677
也许是第二糟糕的

153
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:38,307
Grey's Anatomy  206 Into You Like A Train

154

他的血压保持在90上下.
His BP's steady at ninety over palp.

155
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:47,761
她曾出现两次低血压,均低于70
She's had two hypotensive episodes to the low seventies.

156
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,091
-你在现场的时候找不到一个锯吗? -找不到
- Couldn't get a saw in? - Not without moving them.

157
00:06:50,141 --> 00:06:52,941
那肯定是个坏主意.
- Which would've been a bad idea. - [Burke] Did you bolus her with fluids?

158
00:06:53,081 --> 00:06:55,131
你把那药丸给她吃了吗?
[Paramedic] We're pushing it open...

159
00:06:56,871 --> 00:06:59,471
这是你见过的最疯狂的事情吗?
Is this the craziest thing you've seen?

160
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:04,091
Um,yeah.
Uh... Yeah.

161
00:07:04,851 --> 00:07:08,061
Yeah. 我也是.
Yeah. Me too.

162
00:07:13,031 --> 00:07:14,991
那么好吧,你们从这里接手吧.
OK, then. You guys got it from here.

163
00:07:15,821 --> 00:07:19,091
Hey,uh,你当时在现场吗?
Hey, uh... You were at the scene?

164
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:23,403
Yeah. Won't be too bad for you. Lot of carnage. Not a lot of survivors.

165
00:07:19,811 --> 00:07:21,201
Yeah.对你来说不会太糟糕

166
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:23,911
血流遍野,没有几个幸存者

167
00:07:24,431 --> 00:07:26,141
他俩肯定没办法做c.t了.
They're never gonna fit into CT. We're gonna be flying blind.

168
00:07:26,181 --> 00:07:27,461
我们要靠运气了.
Get X-rays and labs, then page me.

169
00:07:27,491 --> 00:07:30,191
做x-rays和所有测试 做好了就传呼我

170
00:07:30,221 --> 00:07:31,371
请问.
Excuse me?

171
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,761
Hi,我是Burke医生.
Hi, I'm Dr. Burke.

172
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:36,081
你不应该转头.
You shouldn't turn your head. You want to try to move as little as possible.

173
00:07:36,141 --> 00:07:38,511
你现在试着移动,尽可能的小幅度.

174
00:07:38,561 --> 00:07:40,041
Oh,okay.
Oh. OK.

175
00:07:40,821 --> 00:07:44,611
你会把这根竿子尽快拔出来吗
So are you gonna pull this pole out of us anytime soon?

176
00:07:44,671 --> 00:07:46,411
这个碰起来不是很舒服.
Touch uncomfortable.

177
00:07:46,511 --> 00:07:48,731
对不起,我们现在无法移动它.
Sorry, we can't until we get a better look at what's going on internally.

178
00:07:48,741 --> 00:07:50,391
除非掌握了里面的情况.
I assure you we will work as quickly as possible.

179
00:07:50,431 --> 00:07:52,921
但是我向你们保证,我们会尽快解决

180
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:57,501
那么,既然这样的话, 谁有薄荷口香糖?
Well, in that case, does anybody have a breath mint?

181
00:07:59,901 --> 00:08:02,661
给我的,不是给你.
For me, not for you.

182
00:08:04,631 --> 00:08:05,871
带他们去吧.
- Keep them going. - O'Malley? Get them to X-ray.

183
00:08:05,921 --> 00:08:08,011
Uh,o'malley,带他们去做x-ray.

184
00:08:09,371 --> 00:08:10,171
谢谢.
- Thanks. - Move them extremely carefully.

185
00:08:10,211 --> 00:08:13,731
移动的时候千万小心

186
00:08:13,851 --> 00:08:16,111
这个在"电梯急救"之前,绝对没希望发生.
This never would've happened before the elevator.

187
00:08:17,561 --> 00:08:19,451
去吧,george.
You go, George.

188
00:08:21,161 --> 00:08:23,931
Alex,去急诊室帮忙缝合吧.
Alex, cover the ER.

189
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:26,264
You can do sutures while you get over your newfound fear of scalpels.

190
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,991
那样可以帮助你平复对手术刀的恐惧.

191
00:08:28,411 --> 00:08:31,031
那意味着,即使对你而言
That was mean, even for you.

192
00:08:32,631 --> 00:08:36,121
你可是真醉了 去拿袋葡萄糖
You are drunk.

193
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:37,071
Go get yourself a banana bag IV, put it in your arm and then find me.

194
00:08:36,161 --> 00:08:37,761
注射在你自己胳膊上,然后过来找我.
Do not speak to any more patients, do not practice any medicine.

195
00:08:37,801 --> 00:08:39,661
不许和任何病人说话.

196
00:08:39,691 --> 00:08:41,481
不许帮助救治
Well, should I just go home?

197
00:08:41,531 --> 00:08:43,461
那我干脆回家算了?
Unless you drank the whole bottle, you'll be sober in a few hours.

198
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:45,691
除非你喝了整整一瓶龙舌兰

199
00:08:45,731 --> 00:08:47,301
你过一会就会镇静下来了.
And the IV fluids will head off your hangover.

200
00:08:47,341 --> 00:08:49,931
静脉注射能阻止你宿醉.

201
00:08:49,971 --> 00:08:52,331
然后你就能帮助救治那些危急的伤者了
Then you can assist with the many mangled victims here.

202
00:08:52,361 --> 00:08:53,611
你看到了你面前这一片一片的病人.
Besides, if I'm not going home, nobody's going home.

203
00:08:53,641 --> 00:08:55,961
另外还有,如果我没回家的话, 谁也不许回家

204
00:08:56,611 --> 00:08:58,041
结婚十周年.
Ten years of marriage. I didn't even get to finish my damn lobster.

205
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:00,411
我甚至还没吃完那该死的龙虾呢.

206
00:09:02,201 --> 00:09:04,271
Well,um,你需要我给你的什么人打电话吗
Well, is there anyone you'd like me to call?

207
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:06,091
No,他们已经在救护车上给我老婆打电话了.
They called my wife from the ambulance.

208
00:09:06,121 --> 00:09:09,621
还有我未婚夫.他们正一起 从vancouver飞过来呢.
And my fiancé. They're flying down from Vancouver together.

209
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:11,341
一般来说amanda 肯定会有点生气
Normally, Amanda would be upset to find me pressed up against another woman.

210
00:09:11,371 --> 00:09:13,231
当她看到我和另外一个女人挤在一起的话

211
00:09:13,311 --> 00:09:15,851
但是现在这种情况,我想我没事的.
But in this case, I think I'll get a pass.

212
00:09:15,891 --> 00:09:17,751
你们俩不是一起旅行的吗?
- You two weren't traveling together? - No. We just met.

213
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,651
No,我们刚刚认识.
- [Man] Bit of an awkward introduction. - You have very nice pores.

214
00:09:19,781 --> 00:09:21,721
这个出场介绍有点难看

215
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,131
你毛孔非常细致.
[Laughs, groans] Hurts to laugh.

216
00:09:23,201 --> 00:09:26,051
Oh,笑起来可真疼.

217
00:09:27,461 --> 00:09:29,331
Hey. Hey.
- Hey. - Hey.

218
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:30,341
Whoa.
- Whoa. You can go ahead and just... - Oh, thanks.

219
00:09:30,381 --> 00:09:32,671
你可以先来. Oh,thanks.

220
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,397
- [Clears throat] - Oh, wow.

221
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:36,251
Oh,wow.
- Do you think I could... - Yeah, go ahead.

222
00:09:36,281 --> 00:09:38,821
你觉得,uh, 我可以... yeah,过去吧.

223
00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:52,541
Stevens医生, 你有什么需要的吗?
Dr. Stevens, did you need something?

224
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:53,861
没有.
No.

225
00:09:55,401 --> 00:09:56,461
Ow.
- Ow! - I'm sorry. Am I doing this too...

226
00:09:56,521 --> 00:09:57,851
Oh,对不起. 我做的这个太..

227
00:09:57,891 --> 00:09:59,861
ow! Ow!
- Ow! Was that a... Did I have... - A contraction.

228
00:09:59,921 --> 00:10:01,991
那是...

229
00:10:02,071 --> 00:10:02,771
我是...
It was definitely a contraction. We need to book an OR.

230
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,041
一次宫缩. 绝对是一次宫缩.

231
00:10:05,081 --> 00:10:06,261
我们需要去找个手术室
You are in no shape to push, and the baby is still in some distress,

232
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:07,811
听着,虽然你并没有有意的向外推

233
00:10:07,851 --> 00:10:09,621
但是婴儿还是处在一个危险的状态.
so we're gonna have to proceed with a C-section.

234
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:11,951
我们还是要做剖腹产手术

235
00:10:13,891 --> 00:10:15,591
Okay.
OK. OK.

236
00:10:15,671 --> 00:10:19,591
Okay,可以先把我律师叫来吗?
But can we call a lawyer first?

237
00:10:20,001 --> 00:10:21,551
我还没立遗嘱呢
I don't have a will. And there's no father.

238
00:10:21,591 --> 00:10:24,241
而且孩子没有父亲.

239
00:10:25,241 --> 00:10:27,581
万一我发生什么意外的话
And in case something happens to me...

240
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:31,591
根本不需要惊慌, brooke,我们有大把时间呢,okay?
There's no cause for panic, Brooke. We have some time, OK?

241
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:33,181
Okay.
OK.

242
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:35,351
Hello.
- <i>[cell phone rings]</i> - [Woman] Hello.

243
00:10:35,481 --> 00:10:38,051
Oh,不,不 我们挺好的,亲爱的
Oh, no, no, no, we're fine, honey.

244
00:10:38,091 --> 00:10:40,411
Yeah,一些农民想要超火车
Some redneck tried to outrun the train.

245
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:43,231
亲爱的,火车撞上他的屁股了 然后滚了几圈.
The train slammed into his ass and then it rolled...

246
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:44,641
这疼吗? Unh-unh.
- That hurt? - Uh-uh.

247
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:47,171
Oh,不不不不 那哥们都傻B了.
Oh, no, no, that dude is toast.

248
00:10:47,221 --> 00:10:49,141
亲爱的,他和其他200多人呢.
Him and about 200 other people.

249
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:51,161
mary的整个脸都撞变形了
- And Mary got her face all cut up. - Does it hurt anywhere else?

250
00:10:51,201 --> 00:10:53,671
-这疼吗?其他地方呢? -这里
Here.

251
00:10:53,731 --> 00:10:55,691
他们急刹车的时候
A whole bunch of luggage, when they hit the brakes, it just came flying at us.

252
00:10:55,731 --> 00:10:57,521
一整排的行李都冲我们飞过来了.

253
00:10:57,891 --> 00:10:59,191
嗯,好了, 我们要带你去拍个x-ray,
We'll do an X-ray, see if anything's broken, or if there's internal injuries.

254
00:10:59,251 --> 00:11:02,541
看哪里有破损,或者有什么内伤

255
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:03,741
Okay.
OK.

256
00:11:04,181 --> 00:11:05,371
Yeah,等等,等会
Yeah. Wait. Hold on. I'm gonna have to call you back.

257
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:06,641
我一会再打给你
- Hey. Excuse me. Where you going? - I'm taking your friend for an X-ray.

258
00:11:06,701 --> 00:11:08,071
Hey,hey,hey, 对不起,请问

259
00:11:08,121 --> 00:11:11,551
-Um,你们去哪里啊? -我带你朋友去拍x-ray.

260
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,706
[Laughs] No offense, little boy, but you look like my oldest son,

261
00:11:12,641 --> 00:11:13,761
没有恶意,小男孩

262
00:11:13,811 --> 00:11:15,721
你看起来跟我大儿子一样大(这还没恶意?)
- and he's nothing but trouble. - Yvonne, shut up.

263
00:11:15,761 --> 00:11:16,811
他除了到处惹麻烦之外,还基本是个好孩子

264
00:11:16,851 --> 00:11:20,411
-Yvonne,闭嘴吧. -我说了"没恶意",我刚刚说了
I said "no offense." I'm just saying, sure you're a doctor?

265
00:11:20,441 --> 00:11:22,241
你确定你是个医生吗
<i>[Cell phone rings]</i>

266
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,761
Yeah? Oh,yeah,yeah, 我们没事

267

Yeah,没错,一些农民开着汽车超火车
Yeah, this redneck tried to outrun the train...

Ow.

Ow.
- What are you doing? - Trying to insert my banana bag.

00:11:37,521 --> 00:11:38,651
你干吗呢?

272
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:40,761

00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:43,541
听起来有点暧昧不清嗯?但其实一点都不.

274
00:11:44,631 --> 00:11:45,881
我来吧.
I can do it.

275
00:11:46,031 --> 00:11:48,411
那个..addison那婆娘怎么样?
So, how's it going with Addison?

276
00:11:49,031 --> 00:11:51,521
坏心情?还是好心情
Bad mood? Good mood? "Yay, my husband picked me" mood?

277
00:11:51,641 --> 00:11:53,971
还是"Yay,我老公选我啦"的心情?

278
00:11:54,431 --> 00:11:55,731
Uh,我觉得更像是
I think it's more of an "I hate the smell of charred flesh" mood.

279
00:11:55,771 --> 00:11:58,971
"我讨厌那菜鸟的味道"的心情

280
00:12:00,601 --> 00:12:01,281
在你对我下判断之前,
Before you judge me, I know there was a train accident.

281
00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:03,901
我了解刚刚一起火车事故
People are very badly hurt.

282
00:12:03,921 --> 00:12:05,961
人们都伤的很重
And that I'm a vapid narcissist when you mix me with alcohol.

283
00:12:06,031 --> 00:12:07,641
而我又如此顾影自怜的自我安慰

284
00:12:07,681 --> 00:12:09,801
当你们灌我喝酒的时候
In case you were wondering, I know that.

285
00:12:09,981 --> 00:12:12,691
只是防止万一你想知道这些 我知道你想.

286
00:12:13,601 --> 00:12:15,221
那么,看看到底哪个值得,
Well, for what it's worth, I take issue with her salmon-colored scrubs.

287
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:17,601
我觉得她丫是在那儿装没事
I mean, what self-respecting surgeon wears salmon-colored scrubs?

288
00:12:17,651 --> 00:12:19,711
我是说,丫可真是个自尊自爱的好医生

289
00:12:19,751 --> 00:12:21,311
穿一身保护色伪装自己?
- This is what I'm saying. - Yeah.

290
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:23,671
这就是我要说的 Yeah.

291
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,713
[Richard] Thank you.

292
00:12:27,811 --> 00:12:28,681
谢谢.
[Richard] Yang, how's that wound looking?

293
00:12:29,951 --> 00:12:32,181
Yang,那个伤口看起来怎样?
[Cristina] Pretty clean. Some dirt and gravel.

294
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:34,761
还挺干净的.大部分只是泥土和沙砾

295
00:12:34,811 --> 00:12:37,101
这家伙还挺幸运的.这可是致命伤害啊
He was lucky. It's a guillotine injury.

296
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:42,071
如果我们做的没错的话... 他还能继续使用一对完整的大腿.
We do this right, he'll have full use of his leg.

297
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:41,418
- [Richard] More irrigation. - <i>[pager beeps]</i>

298
00:12:42,121 --> 00:12:43,641
Shepherd医生?
Dr. Shepherd?

299
00:12:45,551 --> 00:12:46,911
它得等着.
[Derek] lt'll wait.

300
00:12:48,871 --> 00:12:51,311
我没事,derek. 只是需要调整一下灯光.
I'm fine, Derek. Just adjusting to the light.

301
00:12:51,341 --> 00:12:52,591
我只是想说,不用觉得可耻
There's no shame in taking more time off.

302
00:12:52,621 --> 00:12:53,831
不过是需要多一点时间休息罢了.
It doesn't make you old or tired or rusty, it...

303
00:12:53,851 --> 00:12:57,021
并不意味着你老了, 或者疲劳了,抑或反映迟钝了.

304
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,140
<i>[pager beeps]</i>

305
00:12:57,931 --> 00:12:59,621
Yeah,okay, 说这些有点过火了.
OK, that came out wrong.

306
00:12:59,651 --> 00:13:01,501
你是唯一的神经科主治医生
You're the only attending neurosurgeon, you're needed elsewhere. I'm fine here.

307
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:04,771
很明显,其他地方更需要你 我在这里没问题.

308
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,907
[Nurse] Dr. Shepherd?

309
00:13:07,211 --> 00:13:09,401
如果需要我的话,呼我
[Derek] OK. Page me if you need me.

310
00:13:09,851 --> 00:13:12,051
当你清理干净那伤口的时候
[Richard] When you're finished cleaning that wound, you can help me, Dr. Yang.

311
00:13:12,081 --> 00:13:14,341
你可以过来帮我,yang医生

312
00:13:18,651 --> 00:13:20,551
那伤口干净了吗yang?
Is the wound clean, Yang?

313
00:13:20,751 --> 00:13:22,701
Yes,sir. 那个...但是...
- Yes, sir, I... But... - But what?

314
00:13:22,981 --> 00:13:24,651
但是什么?
If your plan is to be a watchdog for Dr. Shepherd

315
00:13:24,891 --> 00:13:27,351
如果你是想给Shepherd医生做只看门狗

316
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:30,131
或者你认为你的职责是做我的保姆的话
or if you think your job here is to baby-sit me, then you can think again.

317
00:13:30,161 --> 00:13:31,421
那你就继续想下去吧
I've been a surgeon longer than you've been breathing.

318
00:13:31,451 --> 00:13:33,691
我当医生的日子比你吃饭的日子都长

319
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:35,731
如果我没做好准备就站在这手术室里的话
If I were not ready to be in this OR, I would say so. Is that understood?

320
00:13:35,771 --> 00:13:39,131
-我会直接说出来,够清楚吗? -是的,先生

321
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:39,943
- Yes, sir. - Now do we have a problem, Yang?

322
00:13:39,171 --> 00:13:41,991
-那我们现在还有问题吗 yang? -Uh,yes.
Yes. No, sir.

323
00:13:42,581 --> 00:13:45,861
没有,先生,我诚惶诚恐的跟您学习.
I'm thrilled to learn. And I'm grateful to be here.

324
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:48,411
非常感激可以做您的助手,只不过...
It's just that...

325
00:13:48,941 --> 00:13:50,221
那个...
Um...

326
00:13:50,421 --> 00:13:51,751
um...
Sorry. His legs...

327
00:13:51,801 --> 00:13:54,331
对不起,他的两条腿...

328
00:13:54,371 --> 00:13:55,681
两条腿怎么了?
[Richard] What about them?

329
00:13:57,761 --> 00:13:59,581
两条腿都是左腿
[Cristina] They're both left.

330
00:14:03,631 --> 00:14:05,901
去把这爷们的腿找回来,yang.
- Find the man's leg, Yang. Find it now. - Yes, sir.

331
00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:07,681
-现在就去找. -是的先生.
Is it going straight through her spine?

332
00:14:08,621 --> 00:14:11,101
这个是将直接穿过她的脊骨吗?

333
00:14:11,131 --> 00:14:13,541
是啊.T8脊神经完全破碎了.
It is. T8's completely crushed.

334
00:14:14,371 --> 00:14:15,351
Hey.
Hey.

335
00:14:17,251 --> 00:14:18,471
怎么了?
What happened?

336
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,661
Uh,龙舌兰.
Uh, tequila.

337
00:14:22,851 --> 00:14:25,011
我一直看着她呢.
I'm keeping an eye on her.

338
00:14:26,501 --> 00:14:27,781
看这个.
[Derek] Look at this. These people are still alive?

339
00:14:28,511 --> 00:14:31,101
-这俩人还活着呢吗? -他们还闲聊的挺开心呢.
They're still making small talk.

340
00:14:31,761 --> 00:14:33,261
竿子把那伤口全部填塞了
Pole's tamponading the wounds as far as we can see.

341
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,871
挡的我们什么都看不到了
It's hitting the aorta.

342
00:14:34,911 --> 00:14:36,601
这竿子正撞向大动脉呢.
And look at him. It's right in line with his inferior vena cava.

343
00:14:36,641 --> 00:14:40,351
看那男人那边,正好在他右边 次级腔静脉的那条线上.

344
00:14:40,431 --> 00:14:43,131
有什么办法能不分开他们而同时手术吗?
Is there any way to operate without separating them?

345
00:14:43,191 --> 00:14:44,151
No.
- No. - But if we move the pole then...

346
00:14:44,271 --> 00:14:47,591
-如果我们移动那竿子... -他俩都会大量出血
They'll both bleed out.

347
00:14:49,941 --> 00:14:52,691
如果我们不移动那竿子会如何?
What if we don't move the pole?

348
00:14:52,801 --> 00:14:54,691
如果我们只把其中一个病人 从竿子上弄下来
What if we move one of the patients off the pole to get the saw in there?

349
00:14:54,721 --> 00:14:56,461
用锯在那儿切开会如何?

350
00:14:57,311 --> 00:15:00,071
然后我们就可以握着竿子 而稳定住另外一个了.
Then we can hold the pole steady in the other one.

351
00:15:00,211 --> 00:15:01,591
非常非常慢的移动
Move it very slowly, and repair the damage as we go.

352
00:15:01,611 --> 00:15:03,321
然后再救治那伤口.
Who? Which would you move?

353
00:15:03,381 --> 00:15:06,641
谁? 你打算移动哪个?

354
00:15:07,501 --> 00:15:09,341
照情况来看,那女人大动脉损伤严重,
With her aortic injuries,

355
00:15:09,381 --> 00:15:11,891
她能生存下来的机会微乎其微
her chances of survival are extremely slim no matter what we do.

356
00:15:11,951 --> 00:15:13,931
无论我们怎么做,都于事无补.
But if we move her, we have a real shot at saving him.

357
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:16,021
但是如果我们把她先弄下来

358
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,161
我们能及时把那男人救回来.
Well, I could argue since her injuries are more extensive, we should move him.

359
00:15:18,221 --> 00:15:20,611
既然这样,我有不同意见 正因为她的伤害比较宽大.

360
00:15:20,641 --> 00:15:21,991
我们应该把那男人先弄下来
Give her the best shot we can.

361
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:24,361
我们可以全力以赴救治她.

362
00:15:26,441 --> 00:15:30,231
如此说来,无论移动哪个,都是有机会救治的?
So basically whoever you move doesn't stand a chance?

363
00:15:33,591 --> 00:15:35,271
那么你如何选择呢?
So how do you choose? How do you decide who gets to live?

364
00:15:35,891 --> 00:15:38,371
你如何决定谁应该活下来? (共器私用,完全是针对Derek)

365
00:15:44,586 --> 00:15:46,386
我们需要尽快决定 如果想要
We have to decide soon if we want to save one of them.

366
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:47,516
救治其中一个的话
- I'd like to examine them first. - I'll wait for your page.

367
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:50,656
-我想在决定之前对他们做个检查 -那我就等你呼我了.

368
00:15:50,686 --> 00:15:54,886
-Grey医生... -Grey医生需要做一个血液酒精浓度测试
Thank you. Dr. Grey?

369
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:55,882
Dr. Grey needs to get a blood alcohol test before practicing medicine tonight.

370
00:15:54,906 --> 00:15:56,906
在今晚做任何医学实践之前
What? No, I'm totally fine, look. Totally fine.

371
00:15:56,926 --> 00:15:59,886
什么?不用吧.我完全没事了,看着

372
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:01,796
完全没事

373
00:16:04,216 --> 00:16:05,616
好吧,okay.
Right. OK.

374
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:08,076
我真的没事
- I'm fine. - Regretting that last shot about now?

375
00:16:08,116 --> 00:16:10,856
现在为上一个射手后悔了吧你?

376
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:16,316
你在这里做什么呢?
What are you doing in here?

377
00:16:16,356 --> 00:16:18,396
Uh,那个你带来的切断手术患者的腿...
The leg you brought with the amputee...

378
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:19,866
我没带什么切断手术患者来
- I didn't bring in an amputee. - OK, well, one of you did and it's...

379
00:16:19,886 --> 00:16:22,566
Okay,好,um, 其中一个你...

380
00:16:22,596 --> 00:16:25,526
因为所有的救护人员都和你长的一样 对吗,医生?
'Cause all paramedics look alike to you?

381
00:16:25,556 --> 00:16:29,796
Okay,此时此刻,我实在没时间 和你辩论什么自负自大之类的话题.
OK. Really. I cannot straddle another giant ego right now.

382
00:16:29,816 --> 00:16:31,296
我已经在做那手术了
I'm already doing the splits. I need a right leg, right now,

383
00:16:31,316 --> 00:16:33,816
所以我现在就需要那只右腿
or the Chief of Surgery will take away my pretty blue scrubs.

384
00:16:33,836 --> 00:16:36,156
否则主治医生就会脱掉我 美丽可爱的蓝色医生袍.

385
00:16:36,176 --> 00:16:38,496
当那火车出轨的时候正好撞到一个天桥
When the train derailed, it hit an overpass.

386
00:16:38,516 --> 00:16:40,046
餐车的车顶转开飞了出去
The dining car roof sheared off and sliced through a passenger car.

387
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:41,586
然后切开了一个旅客的汽车.
There were multiple decapitations. Your guy can live without his leg.

388
00:16:41,606 --> 00:16:44,356
造成了大量的伤亡.

389
00:16:44,456 --> 00:16:47,046
你那家伙没有腿也能活.

390
00:16:48,266 --> 00:16:51,236
这绝对不仅仅是关于那条腿或那个人.
This is so not about the leg. Or the guy.

391
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:52,956
但是谢谢
But thank you. For all that you do. Really. Thanks.

392
00:16:52,976 --> 00:16:56,656
为所有你做的那些而感谢,真的

393
00:16:59,606 --> 00:17:02,946
Mm-hmm,yeah. Oh,yeah,亲爱的,我们没事
Yeah, honey, we're fine.

394
00:17:02,986 --> 00:17:04,726
Yeah,但是一些农民开着汽车超火车
Some redneck tried to outrun the train, then they give us this boy doctor.

395
00:17:04,756 --> 00:17:06,226
然后他们就走了, 留给我们这个乳臭未干的小医生
All right, scar shouldn't be too bad.

396
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:09,456
好了,疤痕不会太明显

397
00:17:10,506 --> 00:17:13,376
能告诉我,我朋友怎么了吗?
Can you tell me... My friend... She's pregnant too.

398
00:17:13,406 --> 00:17:15,196
她也怀孕了
She went in a different ambulance. She was burned. Do you know where she is?

399
00:17:15,216 --> 00:17:17,686
她被送进另外一个救护车了

400
00:17:17,766 --> 00:17:19,536
她有烧伤

401
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:21,286
你知道她在哪里吗
If she's not here, she should be in Maternity.

402
00:17:21,296 --> 00:17:23,046
如果她不在这左右的话 她应该在妇产科那边.

403
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:26,046
Okay,我要去看她
I need to see her.

404
00:17:26,576 --> 00:17:27,816
我们这里还没完呢,你还需要做一个全面的检查
- We're not finished here. - My baby's fine. I feel her kicking.

405
00:17:27,906 --> 00:17:28,696
我孩子没事
- I've got to see Brooke. - You can't just leave.

406
00:17:28,726 --> 00:17:30,676
我能感觉到她在踢我,我要去看brooke.

407
00:17:30,706 --> 00:17:32,306
uh,等等,你不能就这样走了
[Alex] Just wait. Come here, come here.

408
00:17:32,346 --> 00:17:34,216
等等.过这边来
Ow! Ow!

409
00:17:34,246 --> 00:17:37,706
Ow. Ow!

410
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:40,716
-Sorry. -你之前刚刚做了个心脏手术,george.
Sorry.

411
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,685
So you operated on a heart earlier. You'd think you could draw blood.

412
00:17:40,746 --> 00:17:43,066
你要想想你抽点血根本没问题.

413
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:44,436
我玩那心脏玩好久呢.
- I rocked that heart. - Yeah, you did.

414
00:17:44,476 --> 00:17:45,916
是啊,的确.
I think I'm strung out on the scalpel.

415
00:17:46,776 --> 00:17:50,656
我觉得我对解剖刀上瘾了,

416
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:52,996
没什么不好的
Nothing wrong with that.

417
00:17:55,966 --> 00:17:58,896
那个,有什么消息吗?.关于...
So any news? About...

418
00:17:58,986 --> 00:18:02,076
没有. 我搞不清楚他.
No. I can't read him.

419
00:18:03,066 --> 00:18:04,406
我觉得这有点令人惊讶
I think it's pretty amazing you even gave him the choice.

420
00:18:04,436 --> 00:18:06,266
你甚至连选择都给他了
And I think, for what it's worth,

421
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:09,396
我觉得为了值得的事情

422
00:18:09,486 --> 00:18:11,656
如果他没选你的话,他可是疯到家了.
I think he's crazy if he doesn't pick you.

423
00:18:13,216 --> 00:18:15,286
拜托告诉我你们见到了一只右腿
Please tell me you've seen a right leg, a cleanly severed right leg.

424
00:18:15,326 --> 00:18:17,386
一只干净整洁的右腿.
No.

425
00:18:17,516 --> 00:18:18,876
没看到.

426
00:18:20,506 --> 00:18:22,676
这工作到底多变态?
How weird is this job?

427
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:25,456
变态.
Weird.

428
00:18:26,116 --> 00:18:27,396
Brooke?
- Brooke? - Jana?

429
00:18:27,446 --> 00:18:29,036
Jana?

430
00:18:31,846 --> 00:18:33,106
谢天谢地.
- Thank God. - Dr. Karev?

431
00:18:33,156 --> 00:18:36,346
-Karev医生? 她也在火车上? -我阻止不了她,她要过来看她
- I couldn't stop her. - She was on the train?

432
00:18:36,396 --> 00:18:38,826
-是的 -你做了超声波吗?
- Yes, but... - Have you done an ultrasound?

433
00:18:38,856 --> 00:18:40,626
清除了她的C脊骨?
Cleared her C-spine?

434
00:18:40,696 --> 00:18:42,376
有什么原因你可以认为这个病人
Is there a reason why she is wandering around the hospital unattended?

435
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:44,926
可以随意在医院里到处漫游而无人照料?
She's not unattended. I came up with her. She's...

436
00:18:44,966 --> 00:18:47,296
她不是没人照料的,我和她一起来的

437
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:49,636
你现在可以走了,
You can leave now, Dr. Karev.

438
00:18:49,686 --> 00:18:51,306
Karev医生.

439
00:18:54,496 --> 00:18:57,256
太不负责任了, 即使对一个实习生来说.
Irresponsible even for an intern.

440
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,316
怎么,你不同意?
What? You disagree?

441
00:19:00,576 --> 00:19:01,806
她要来看她的朋友.
She wanted to see her friend. I mean, what was he supposed to do, tackle her?

442
00:19:01,846 --> 00:19:04,226
我是说,他能怎么办? 把她捆起来?

443
00:19:04,906 --> 00:19:08,106
Stevens医生,为什么你不去 把我们的新患者送上床呢?
Dr. Stevens, why don't you get our new patient into a bed? Shall we?

444
00:19:08,266 --> 00:19:09,566
可以吗?

445
00:19:13,126 --> 00:19:15,196
能感觉到这个吗, krasnoff小姐?
Can you feel that, Miss Krasnoff?

446
00:19:15,256 --> 00:19:17,136
你是个帅医生.
You're a cute doctor. Cute doctors get to call me by my first name.

447
00:19:17,206 --> 00:19:20,246
帅医生应该直接叫我名字

448
00:19:21,586 --> 00:19:22,746
Bonnie.
- Bonnie? - Mmm.

449
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,116
Okay,bonnie.
OK, Bonnie. Can you feel that, Bonnie?

450
00:19:26,146 --> 00:19:27,626
能感觉到这个吗bonnie?
Can I feel what? Oh. Well, I guess that's a no.

451
00:19:27,656 --> 00:19:29,546
我能感觉到什么?

452
00:19:29,606 --> 00:19:32,266
Oh. Oh,那我猜是感觉不到了.

453
00:19:32,826 --> 00:19:34,606
-对不起 -shepherd医生? -嗯?
- [George] Dr. Shepherd? - Yes.

454
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:36,466
我拿到检查结果了.
- I got the labs. - Great, thank you.

455
00:19:36,516 --> 00:19:38,206
oh,太好了,谢谢
Here you go. Hold that, please.

456
00:19:38,286 --> 00:19:40,136
拿着这个.
Could you try to wiggle your toes, Mr. Maynard?

457
00:19:40,386 --> 00:19:43,866
你能试着动动你的脚趾吗 Maynard先生?

458
00:19:44,886 --> 00:19:46,176
动了吗?
- Are they moving? - Yes, they are.

459
00:19:46,246 --> 00:19:47,116
是的,动了.
- Good. That's good, right? - Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

460
00:19:47,156 --> 00:19:49,616
好,好现象对吗?

461
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:51,116
是的,那是.
What about me? Are mine moving?

462
00:19:51,146 --> 00:19:53,546
我呢?我的动了吗?

463
00:19:56,756 --> 00:19:58,386
是的,也动了
Yes, they are.

464
00:19:58,876 --> 00:20:00,956
Yay 我
Yay me.

465
00:20:02,296 --> 00:20:05,406
Shepherd医生,对吗? 嗯,对
- [Man] Dr. Shepherd, is it? - Yes, it is.

466
00:20:05,536 --> 00:20:07,146
Shepherd医生,
Dr. Shepherd, Bonnie and I...

467
00:20:07,366 --> 00:20:09,356
bonnie 和我..

468
00:20:10,606 --> 00:20:12,066
我们要一直这样生活吗?
- are we going to live through this? - Now that's just morose, Tom.

469
00:20:12,106 --> 00:20:14,426
这问题可有点郁闷了,tom.
I'm sorry, dear.

470
00:20:14,466 --> 00:20:16,216
对不起,亲爱的.

471
00:20:17,446 --> 00:20:18,966
医生?
Doctor?

472
00:20:20,646 --> 00:20:23,366
我们会尽全力做所有我们能做的,Maynard先生.
We're going to do everything we can, Mr. Maynard.

473
00:20:30,586 --> 00:20:31,506
时间啊,yang.
About time. I was starting to think my work here would be wasted.

474
00:20:31,536 --> 00:20:33,566
我都开始考虑,我在这里工作简直是一种浪费

475
00:20:33,616 --> 00:20:36,516
真对不起,不太好找啊
So sorry. It wasn't easy to find.

476
00:20:36,556 --> 00:20:38,086
我检查了伤口
I checked the wound and it's very clean cut, well preserved.

477
00:20:38,116 --> 00:20:40,186
切面很好,而且保存的不错
Dr. Webber?

478
00:20:40,246 --> 00:20:42,076
Webber医生?

479
00:20:50,646 --> 00:20:51,296
先生?
Sir?

480
00:20:51,346 --> 00:20:53,396
注意到那关于那腿的其他事情了吗?
Notice anything else about that leg? Anything other than that very clean cut?

481
00:20:53,436 --> 00:20:56,466
除了非常整洁的切面之外的任何其他事情?

482
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:58,296
你是否真的注意到其他,例如
Did you happen to notice, for example, that it was shaved recently?

483
00:20:58,336 --> 00:21:00,416
最近是不是刮腿毛了
And manicured? Take a look at my patient, Dr. Yang.

484
00:21:00,446 --> 00:21:02,386
修过指甲吗?

485
00:21:02,426 --> 00:21:05,156
仔细看看我的病人,yang医生

486
00:21:05,196 --> 00:21:06,896
他是那种看起来像是
Does he look like a man who woke up and shaved one of his legs this morning?

487
00:21:06,926 --> 00:21:10,216
今早只刮一只腿的腿毛的男人吗?

488
00:21:10,406 --> 00:21:11,866
不像.
No.

489
00:21:11,926 --> 00:21:14,896
我马上去找,那个um,对的
I'll go find the right... the right right leg.

490
00:21:14,946 --> 00:21:16,506
那个对的右腿...对的右腿...
- The right... - Thank you.

491
00:21:16,546 --> 00:21:18,256
谢谢

492
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:25,253
有什么进展了
- Where are we? - You were right. Vitals are erratic.

493
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:30,615
Pulse is weak. The spine's severed. I was hoping that it didn't hit.

494
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:33,817
But from that angle, it just can't have missed the aorta.

495
00:21:34,342 --> 00:21:36,912
那男人如何了?觉得他能活下来?
What about him? Think he can live?

496
00:21:37,732 --> 00:21:39,372
他有更大的机会
- He's got better odds. - Let OR One know we're coming.

497
00:21:39,422 --> 00:21:41,942
那好吧,去通知手术室我们马上过来

498
00:21:43,812 --> 00:21:45,162
o'malley?
And, O'Malley, close off the gallery. We don't need an audience for this.

499
00:21:45,292 --> 00:21:46,442
把展示窗关上

500
00:21:46,482 --> 00:21:48,482
我们不需要任何观众围观

501
00:21:50,522 --> 00:21:52,572
她还在开玩笑呢
She's cracking jokes.

502
00:21:52,862 --> 00:21:54,842
你如何告诉某人她马上就要死了,
How do you tell someone she'll be dead soon when she's cracking jokes?

503
00:21:54,882 --> 00:21:56,982
还在她坐在那里开玩笑的时候

504
00:22:03,852 --> 00:22:04,782
请问.
Excuse me? Is there any chance that we can get out of here some time this year?

505
00:22:04,822 --> 00:22:06,912
有什么机会我们能离开这里吗

506
00:22:06,932 --> 00:22:09,272
-今年某些时候? -那个,测试结果还没出来
Well, the lab's backed up and so is Radiology.

507
00:22:09,302 --> 00:22:11,472
X光结果也没出来.
I can't discharge her until I know she has no internal injuries.

508
00:22:11,492 --> 00:22:14,252
在我没确定她没有任何内伤之前 我不能让你朋友出院.

509
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:14,926
<i>[Cell phone rings]</i>

510
00:22:16,822 --> 00:22:19,312
Hello? Yeah,我们还在这里呢
[Yvonne] Hello? Yeah, we're still here,

511
00:22:19,372 --> 00:22:21,812
因为我们的医生真tmd没用.
'cause the doctor's friggin' useless. Mm-hm.

512
00:22:22,302 --> 00:22:23,922
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
I realize you're dealing with a lot of carnage.

513
00:22:23,962 --> 00:22:26,732
我了解你正在处理大量的伤亡患者.

514
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:30,632
我只想问问,如果你可能从那伤亡人口中
I'm asking if you could maybe sift through some of that carnage

515
00:22:30,662 --> 00:22:33,012
筛下什么来,或者找到...
and find a... Hello... Dammit.

516
00:22:33,182 --> 00:22:35,542
hello?该死.
Cristina. You paged me?

517
00:22:35,592 --> 00:22:37,442
Cristina,你呼我了?
If I don't find this leg, the chief is gonna cut me from this program.

518
00:22:37,542 --> 00:22:39,032
如果我找不到那只腿

519
00:22:39,052 --> 00:22:40,952
头就会把我从这个手术中赶出来
And I cannot go back home, Burke. It is too sunny in Los Angeles.

520
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:42,822
我不能回家去burke.

521
00:22:42,842 --> 00:22:45,872
L.A实在是太阳光普照了. 而且是每天都那么阳光明媚
It's sunny every day.

522
00:22:47,022 --> 00:22:49,192
那么你呼我是因为?
And you paged me because?

523
00:22:49,252 --> 00:22:51,782
我需要你帮我找到那条腿
I need you to help me find the leg.

524
00:22:51,822 --> 00:22:55,272
我检查了公告版,你没有手术对吧?
I checked the board. You're not in surgery, right?

525
00:22:57,312 --> 00:22:59,802
你是我男朋友!我是说...
You're my boyfriend. I mean...

526
00:23:00,242 --> 00:23:01,882
我知道,对这种事情我没什么经验
I know I don't have much experience with this kind of thing,

527
00:23:01,912 --> 00:23:03,672
但是...
but aren't boyfriends supposed to help in situations like this?

528
00:23:03,692 --> 00:23:05,072
男朋友不是用来救场的吗

529
00:23:05,102 --> 00:23:06,792
尤其是在这种情况下?
Cristina, when we're on duty, I can't be your boyfriend.

530
00:23:06,812 --> 00:23:10,272
Cristina,当我们在值班的时候,我不能做你男朋友

531
00:23:10,332 --> 00:23:11,662
Okay?
OK, so when we're on duty, I can have sex with someone else?

532
00:23:12,222 --> 00:23:14,682
Okay,所以,当我们在值班的时候,

533
00:23:14,722 --> 00:23:16,912
我能和其他什么人做爱?

534
00:23:18,622 --> 00:23:21,082
Yang医生,我可走了啊
Dr. Yang, I'm walking away now.

535
00:23:21,352 --> 00:23:22,652
好,很好.
Fine. Fine. But when the chief cuts me, you might rethink this.

536
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:26,242
但是当头儿一旦把我赶出来, 你就会重新考虑这个了

537
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:29,722
Addison在病人面前大声训斥你?
Addison yelled at you in front of a patient?

538
00:23:29,772 --> 00:23:31,352
她倒没有特别大声.
She didn't exactly yell.

539
00:23:34,222 --> 00:23:35,822
好吧,她是魔鬼的妓女.
- Fine, she's Satan's whore. - Thank you. So did you yell back?

540
00:23:35,852 --> 00:23:38,152
谢谢,那你跟她喊回去了吗?

541
00:23:38,182 --> 00:23:39,562
没有
- No. - Dude, you lost your mojo.

542
00:23:39,642 --> 00:23:42,542
-伙计,你真失去你的本性了 -再说一次?
- Excuse you? - I was trying to talk boy.

543
00:23:42,582 --> 00:23:44,062
我只是试图和你聊天,小子.
O'Malley plugs a hole with his finger and he's a hero.

544
00:23:44,262 --> 00:23:45,832
O'malley 只不过把手指塞在个洞里罢了

545
00:23:45,862 --> 00:23:47,572
周围的人全都把他当成什么了不起的大英雄了.
- I have one off day... - You chickened out.

546
00:23:47,602 --> 00:23:50,442
-我有权利休息一天.. -你胆小如鼠

547
00:23:50,482 --> 00:23:54,362
-我只不过犹豫了一小会儿而已 -为什么你不吻izzie?
I hesitated briefly.

548
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,521
Why didn't you kiss lzzie?

549
00:23:54,402 --> 00:23:55,492
嗯..我要走了
- And now I'm leaving. - It's not in the morgue.

550
00:23:55,532 --> 00:23:56,592
也不在太平间
I've looked in the ambulances, in the ER...

551
00:23:56,632 --> 00:23:58,852
我找过救护车了,找过急诊室

552
00:23:58,892 --> 00:24:02,472
为啥一个tmd的流血的毛腿 就这么毁了我的职业生涯了?
How is one bloody, hairy leg going to destroy my career?

553
00:24:03,292 --> 00:24:04,992
Karev医生?
[Man] Dr. Karev?

554
00:24:08,352 --> 00:24:10,012
我希望你找回原来个性的自己alex.
I hope you find your mojo, Alex. I find you disturbing without it.

555
00:24:10,042 --> 00:24:13,382
-我发现没有那个性,你有点心烦意乱 -我也希望.
[Alex] Me too.

556
00:24:14,222 --> 00:24:15,392
Ow.
- [Thud] - Ow!

557
00:24:17,592 --> 00:24:20,612
这个有点难度,因为你们的身体
[Derek] This is hard, because your body is in a certain amount of shock.

558
00:24:20,652 --> 00:24:23,722
正处在一定数量级的振荡当中.

559
00:24:23,772 --> 00:24:25,622
可以防止你们感觉到疼痛
It's preventing you from feeling pain, feeling the extent of your injuries.

560
00:24:25,642 --> 00:24:27,412
也可以防止

561
00:24:27,452 --> 00:24:29,292
你们伤口的扩大.

562
00:24:29,852 --> 00:24:31,612
Shepherd医生?
[Bonnie] Dr. Shepherd.

563
00:24:31,662 --> 00:24:34,022
这金属竿子在我们体内
We have a metal pole cutting a path through our insides.

564
00:24:34,052 --> 00:24:36,442
开出一条小路来穿过我们.

565
00:24:36,802 --> 00:24:38,102
我不知道tom如何想的
I don't know about Tom here,

566
00:24:38,122 --> 00:24:39,902
但是我没期待
but I didn't expect to walk out of here anytime soon, so...

567
00:24:39,942 --> 00:24:43,442
什么时候能从这里走出去...

568
00:24:43,652 --> 00:24:45,082
无论是什么方法,决定 你需要告诉我们的
whatever it is you have to say, just please, say it.

569
00:24:45,132 --> 00:24:48,222
请你尽管说.

570
00:24:48,272 --> 00:24:50,172
Okay,bonnie.
[Derek] OK, Bonnie.

571
00:24:52,712 --> 00:24:54,742
为了给Maynard先生做手术,
In order to operate on Mr. Maynard, we have to separate you two.

572
00:24:54,772 --> 00:24:57,172
我们必须把你们俩先分开.

573
00:24:57,542 --> 00:24:59,612
为了手术而分开
In order to do that, we have to move you backwards off the pole.

574
00:24:59,802 --> 00:25:02,592
我们需要把你向后移动,直到移下竿子.

575
00:25:04,312 --> 00:25:06,692
你不能同时把竿子从我俩中拉下来吗?
Can't you just pull the pole out of both of us?

576
00:25:06,732 --> 00:25:08,532
如果我们这样做
If we did that, you would both start bleeding very quickly. Too quickly.

577
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:11,722
你们俩都会大量出血,非常迅速

578
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:14,242
此时那竿子正塞住伤口.
Right now the pole is plugging the wounds.

579
00:25:14,272 --> 00:25:15,732
一旦移动
Once removed, the organs will shift.

580
00:25:16,062 --> 00:25:18,682
所有脏器全部跟着移动
And there is a great deal of damage.

581
00:25:18,762 --> 00:25:21,382
同时会造成大量的毁坏

582
00:25:23,062 --> 00:25:26,022
那么如果你们移动我的话...
So, if you move me, I'll die?

583
00:25:26,092 --> 00:25:28,142
我就会死?

584
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:34,642
我们会做一切我们能做的...
We're gonna do everything we can to...

585
00:25:34,682 --> 00:25:37,042
no. No.
[Tom] No. No. If anybody has to go, it should be me.

586
00:25:37,122 --> 00:25:38,132
如果有人需要死的话
- You just move me... - No, Mr. Maynard.

587
00:25:38,152 --> 00:25:40,412
那应该是我. 你们就移动...

588
00:25:40,462 --> 00:25:43,612
Maynard先生,Maynard先生,
Mr. Maynard.

589
00:25:44,582 --> 00:25:48,062
你的伤害扩张的可能比较小
Your injuries are less extensive.

590
00:25:48,302 --> 00:25:52,152
如果我们把竿子从你这边拿出来 并在那四周手术的话
If we pull the pole from you as we operate around it,

591
00:25:52,192 --> 00:25:55,192
我们有更大的机会来救治创伤.
we have a better chance of repairing the damage.

592
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:01,862
这不对
It's not right.

593
00:26:02,912 --> 00:26:04,582
这不公平.
It's not fair.

594
00:26:04,642 --> 00:26:06,272
Tom...
Tom.

595
00:26:06,722 --> 00:26:09,642
任何一种方法都不公平
It's not fair either way.

596
00:26:14,082 --> 00:26:16,032
那个,um...
Is um... Is my Danny... Is he here yet?

597
00:26:16,342 --> 00:26:18,802
我家danny...他来了吗?

598
00:26:18,842 --> 00:26:20,192
班机延迟了.
There are delays at the airport. The storm...

599
00:26:20,242 --> 00:26:21,582
Um,因为暴风雪...
We could wait.

600
00:26:21,612 --> 00:26:25,562
我们可以等, 但是我们等的越久
But the longer we do, the higher the risk of infection for...

601
00:26:25,592 --> 00:26:28,582
感染的危险性就越高...

602
00:26:28,612 --> 00:26:30,472
不,不用等.
No. No.

603
00:26:30,532 --> 00:26:32,642
这个更好一些
This is better.

604
00:26:33,562 --> 00:26:36,472
Danny 不会理解的
Danny, he wouldn't understand.

605
00:26:38,102 --> 00:26:42,632
我已经有几个小时来处理所有这些
I've had a couple of hours to, you know, process all of this,

606
00:26:42,672 --> 00:26:47,812
但是如果他看到我了, 和我说一些话,我...
but if... if he had to see me, talk to me like this...

607
00:26:51,002 --> 00:26:53,582
well,我只是觉得那将会非常难过
Well, I just think it would be too hard.

608
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:08,819
[Both inhale and exhale]

609
00:27:11,812 --> 00:27:14,842
就在那里... 在脊椎间隔里.
[Addison] Right there. In between the vertebral spaces.

610
00:27:14,882 --> 00:27:16,982
不要害怕加压.
Don't be shy about pressure.

611
00:27:17,172 --> 00:27:19,732
很好,你做的很好
That's good. You are doing so good.

612
00:27:19,782 --> 00:27:21,792
有人叫公证人了吗?
- Somebody called for a notary? - I asked for a lawyer.

613
00:27:21,832 --> 00:27:23,092
我是想找个律师
I couldn't get one at this time of night.

614
00:27:23,122 --> 00:27:24,952
在这夜深人静的时候我可找不到.
But the hospital has pretty standard forms.

615
00:27:24,952 --> 00:27:27,262
但是医院有多种多样的标准表格.

616
00:27:27,292 --> 00:27:28,762
比如如果意外死亡
It says that in the case of death or permanent vegetative state,

617
00:27:28,792 --> 00:27:30,262
或者变成植物人,
your child remains in the custody of... We put her name in.

618
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:32,052
那样的话,你的子女将会在某人的监护下

619
00:27:32,102 --> 00:27:33,732
我们会把她的名字放上去
Wait. What? What are we... Who's dying here?

620
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:36,942
等等,什么? 我们是什么? 这里谁要死了?

621
00:27:36,972 --> 00:27:40,362
有些危险. 任何手术都有危险
There's some danger. With any surgery, there's danger.

622
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:42,452
就brooke的烧伤来说
But with the trauma of Brooke's burns, there's an additional risk of shock.

623
00:27:42,472 --> 00:27:44,342
有休克的额外风险.
- She wants to be certain. - That's ridiculous.

624
00:27:44,382 --> 00:27:47,912
-她只是想有个保障而已. -这可真荒谬,你太荒谬了.

625
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:48,355
You're going to be fine, do you hear me?

626
00:27:47,942 --> 00:27:50,022
-你马上就没事了,你听到我的话了吗? -我听到了.
I hear you. But we still have to sign the forms

627
00:27:50,062 --> 00:27:52,322
但是我们还是需要签字

628
00:27:52,322 --> 00:27:54,912
除非你想把我们的儿子最后交给我妈.
unless you want our son to end up with my mom.

629
00:27:59,782 --> 00:28:02,142
你们俩在一起多久了?
How long have you two been together?

630
00:28:02,182 --> 00:28:04,292
从3年级开始.
Since third grade.

631
00:28:05,342 --> 00:28:07,842
我们不是爱人,只是最好的朋友而已
We're not lovers, we're best friends. We wanted our kids to have two parents.

632
00:28:07,862 --> 00:28:10,172
我们只是希望我们的孩子有两个父母.
- So we got a sperm donor... - The same donor?

633
00:28:10,202 --> 00:28:12,412
所以我们找了个精子捐赠人

634
00:28:12,562 --> 00:28:15,832
同一个捐赠人?那么你们的孩子是兄妹了?
So your babies are brother and sister?

635
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:17,722
Oh,太牛X了啊
How cool is that?

636
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,272
-真是... -wow.
- That's... Wow. - [Trickling]

637
00:28:19,302 --> 00:28:21,612
-湿了. -什么?
- Wet. - What?

638
00:28:21,682 --> 00:28:22,922
我湿了
I'm wet. I think my water just broke.

639
00:28:22,972 --> 00:28:24,832
-Oh,天. -我猜我的羊水刚刚破了.

640
00:28:27,192 --> 00:28:28,312
好消息
Good news. You've got a broken rib, we're gonna give you some painkillers.

641
00:28:28,352 --> 00:28:29,272
你的一根肋骨坏了.

642
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:31,842
我们会给你一些止痛药...

643
00:28:31,882 --> 00:28:34,532
-之后,你就应该可以出院了 -谢谢.
- After that you should be good to go. - Thank you.

644
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:35,970
<i>[Cell phone rings]</i>

645
00:28:37,142 --> 00:28:39,272
Yvonne,接电话.
Yvonne, answer your phone.

646
00:28:39,942 --> 00:28:42,242
Yvonne? Yvonne?
Yvonne? Yvonne?

647
00:28:43,812 --> 00:28:45,122
Yvonne?!
Yvonne!

648
00:28:45,562 --> 00:28:47,252
蓝色警报, 我这里需要帮忙
- Code blue! I need some help here! - [Mary] Yvonne!

649
00:28:47,302 --> 00:28:48,532
Yvonne?!

650
00:28:50,633 --> 00:28:52,163
一个epi.拿住 c.p.r.
Push one of epi. Hold CPR.

651
00:28:52,203 --> 00:28:54,123
她的腹部正在扩张,有固体在里面
Her abdomen is rock solid. She's lost too much blood.

652
00:28:54,153 --> 00:28:56,473
她失了很多血,她必然是流血流了几个钟头.
- She's been bleeding for hours. - There's no blood.

653
00:28:56,493 --> 00:28:58,123
但是根本没有血啊,她没流血.
- She was bleeding internally. - She didn't say anything.

654
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,513
她是内出血

655
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:02,233
她什么都没说 她没有...
- <i>[continuous beep]</i> - She was... She wasn't even a patient.

656
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:03,833
她甚至都不是个病人.
I didn't know.

657
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:06,323
我不知道

658
00:29:07,093 --> 00:29:09,293
Karev医生,她死了
[Nurse] Dr. Karev, she's gone.

659
00:29:09,343 --> 00:29:11,273
不不不!!!
[Mary] No! No!

660
00:29:12,743 --> 00:29:15,683
不不不!!! Yvonne!
No! No! Yvonne!

661
00:29:15,723 --> 00:29:16,593
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

662
00:29:19,193 --> 00:29:20,883
死亡时间... 2:51.
Time of death, 2:51.

663
00:29:20,913 --> 00:29:21,763
No! No! No!
[Mary] No, no, no, no.

664
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:24,033
No! No! No!
Don't. Try again. Try again.

665
00:29:25,543 --> 00:29:28,313
再试试,再试!

666
00:29:34,203 --> 00:29:36,383
Jana,这是我们妇产科主治医生Hoffman医生.
Jana, this is our OB resident, Dr. Hoffman.

667
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:38,323
她从现在开始接管你.
She's gonna be taking care of you from here.

668
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:38,765
Uh-huh.

669
00:29:39,633 --> 00:29:42,043
你做的非常好jana. 继续呼吸.
You're doing great, Jana, keep breathing.

670
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:43,663
我现在要检查一下你的宫颈.
I'm gonna check your cervix now.

671
00:29:44,063 --> 00:29:45,163
Brooke, 我们预约了一个手术室
We've booked an OR but they won't hold it for long

672
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:47,613
但是他们不会保留太久,所以我们现在就要过去了.
- so we need to go now. - Right now?

673
00:29:47,643 --> 00:29:48,303
现在?
But we're supposed to be together. We took classes.

674
00:29:48,943 --> 00:29:51,873
但是我们应该是在一起的啊,我们一起上的产前培训课.

675
00:29:51,903 --> 00:29:53,473
我很抱歉,我们等不了了.
- I'm sorry, but we can't wait. - That's OK, Brookie.

676
00:29:53,513 --> 00:29:56,683
这没什么,brookie.你先去做你的剖腹产手术
You go have your C-section. And enjoy those drugs.

677
00:29:57,193 --> 00:29:58,643
好好享用那麻醉药品咯
- This is already not fun for my vagina. - Dr. Stevens?

678
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:00,913
这对我的阴道来说可一点都不好玩

679
00:30:00,973 --> 00:30:02,573
Stevens医生.
- No. If I have to go, she has to stay. - Someone has to stay with Jana. Please.

680
00:30:02,623 --> 00:30:03,523
No.

681
00:30:03,563 --> 00:30:05,803
如果我必须去的话,她必须留下来

682
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:07,963
至少留个人来照顾jana吧,拜托了?
Brooke, Dr. Stevens is a surgeon, but I'm gonna...

683
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:10,333
Brooke,Stevens医生是个外科医生

684
00:30:10,353 --> 00:30:12,473
-但是我会帮你找一个... -我可以.
It's OK. I'll stay.

685
00:30:12,513 --> 00:30:14,193
我留下来.

686
00:30:15,833 --> 00:30:17,113
Okay.
OK.

687

Easy, killer. Jill said you guys were freaking out looking for this leg.

693
00:30:38,273 --> 00:30:39,193
放松点

694
00:30:39,233 --> 00:30:42,583
Jill说你们找这条破腿都找疯了啊

695
00:30:44,523 --> 00:30:45,123
-谢谢 -不用谢

00:30:59,373 --> 00:31:00,603
我找到了这腿.
[Richard] You missed out on this, but I'm sure they could use a hand in ER.

701
00:31:00,633 --> 00:31:02,223
你错过这场好戏了,yang.

702
00:31:02,253 --> 00:31:04,853
但是我肯定急诊室那边肯定需要人手帮忙

703
00:31:04,883 --> 00:31:06,823
Karev和我从现在开始完全可以处理这个了.
Karev and I can handle it from here.

I barely touched her. This isn't my fault.

750

It's nobody's fault. We need to remove her now.

00:38:42,094 --> 00:38:44,444
她走的很痛苦吗?

833
00:38:45,024 --> 00:38:48,864
不,她的伤害正好阻止了...
No. Her injuries prevented her from...

834
00:38:51,284 --> 00:38:53,784
没有,她一点痛苦都没有
No, she wasn't in any pain.

835
00:38:54,174 --> 00:38:55,784
很好.
Good. That's...

836
00:38:56,404 --> 00:38:58,144
这个...

837
00:39:02,344 --> 00:39:04,084
她让我...
She asked me to... to tell you that...

838
00:39:04,724 --> 00:39:06,564
告诉你...

839
00:39:10,084 --> 00:39:11,474
她想让你知道,
She wanted you to know that if love were enough...

840
00:39:12,564 --> 00:39:14,504
如果爱的力量足够伟大的话...

841
00:39:17,134 --> 00:39:18,024
如果爱的力量足够伟大的话,
that if love were enough, that she'd still be here with you.

842
00:39:18,074 --> 00:39:20,624
她还是会一直陪在你身边的

843
00:39:40,764 --> 00:39:42,734
做为医生...
<i>[Meredith] As surgeons,</i>

844
00:39:45,274 --> 00:39:48,204
太多的事情我们需要了解了.
<i>there are so many things</i> <i>we have to know.</i>

845
00:39:48,244 --> 00:39:49,884
做的不错 Karev医生.
- Fine work, Dr. Karev. - Thank you, sir.

846
00:39:49,924 --> 00:39:51,354
谢谢,先生.
<i>We have to know we have what it takes.</i>

847
00:39:51,794 --> 00:39:55,154
我们要了解我们需要掌握的.

848
00:40:09,154 --> 00:40:11,734
我们要了解如何照顾病人
<i>We have to know</i> <i>how to take care of our patients.</i>

849
00:40:11,774 --> 00:40:13,754
Tom现在情况非常好.
[Burke] Tom is doing just fine.

850
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:16,374
[& Emiliana Torrini: <i>Today Has Been Okay]</i>

851
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:17,744
[Chime]

852
00:40:28,474 --> 00:40:31,584
还有如何彼此照顾
<i>And how to take care of each other.</i>

853
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,851
<i>[Bell rings]</i>

854
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:43,029
[Derek sniffles]

855
00:40:51,184 --> 00:40:51,634
Okay?
- OK? - Yeah.

856
00:40:51,684 --> 00:40:52,974
Yeah.

857
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,275
<i>[Ringing stops]</i>

858
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,654
最终..
<i>Eventually we even have to figure out...</i>

859
00:41:11,894 --> 00:41:14,054
我们更要了解

860
00:41:15,104 --> 00:41:18,044
如何照顾我们自己.
<i>how to take care of ourselves.</i>

861
00:41:23,684 --> 00:41:25,134
作为医生,
<i>As surgeons, we have to be in the know.</i>

862
00:41:25,174 --> 00:41:27,774
我们必须一直了解

863
00:41:30,954 --> 00:41:33,874
但是作为人类,
<i>But as human beings,</i>

864
00:41:34,794 --> 00:41:38,174
有时候处在黑暗中其实更好一些
<i>sometimes</i> <i>it's better to stay in the dark.</i>

865
00:41:41,184 --> 00:41:43,324
因为...
<i>Because in the dark,</i> <i>there may be fear...</i>

866
00:41:44,124 --> 00:41:47,604
黑暗中也许会有恐惧...

867
00:41:53,294 --> 00:41:55,704
但同时也有希望.
<i>but there's also hope.</i>

868
00:42:04,064 --> 00:42:05,924
你们最好去洗个澡把自己弄干净.
Better get cleaned up. Rounds. Five minutes.

869
00:42:05,964 --> 00:42:09,334
自由活动5分钟.
