2
00:00:01,061 --> 00:00:03,178
不让你搭车了 你自己走路上班吧

3
00:00:03,262 --> 00:00:07,669
明白了 你在精神上被强奸了 我们可以继续了吗? 下面来的可是猛料

4
00:00:07,763 --> 00:00:12,163
你怎么能给这样的事找到理由的? 你闯进Stacy的心理医生的办公室...

5
00:00:12,273 --> 00:00:12,984
借了个钥匙

6
00:00:13,068 --> 00:00:15,291
...而且偷了她的档案!

7
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:17,245
没有!我复印了

8
00:00:17,372 --> 00:00:19,685
Mark是 我证明

9
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:25,100
"孤僻 被动的好斗 不愿交流 就好像他在嫉妒我能走路"

10
00:00:25,184 --> 00:00:26,262
我不想听这个

11
00:00:26,374 --> 00:00:28,756
盘子堆在水池里 坐便器的垫子掀着

12
00:00:29,027 --> 00:00:31,629
同时 她情不自禁的想...

13
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:36,499
我看不懂这个 是她困扰于一个叫Grey Horse的? 还是我?

14
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:39,511
这上面说她认为你是个讨厌的蠢货

15
00:00:39,595 --> 00:00:41,013
那是个宠物的名字

16
00:00:41,578 --> 00:00:43,009
重点是这个

17
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,578
他们没有爱爱?

18
00:00:52,148 --> 00:00:54,735
医生允许了 但是没点火

19
00:00:54,876 --> 00:00:57,525
她很沮丧 所以她在想法子修理我

20
00:00:57,732 --> 00:01:00,764
文书 开会 管我的病人的闲事

21
00:01:00,848 --> 00:01:02,472
好极了 你现在有了想要的证据 ...

22
00:01:02,556 --> 00:01:06,743
把这些个人治疗文件拿给Cuddy 证明Stacy失去控制了

23
00:01:07,396 --> 00:01:08,790
你忽视我?

24
00:01:08,962 --> 00:01:12,492
在找我的报纸 很有效率吧?

25
00:01:12,926 --> 00:01:14,421
这儿呢!

26
00:01:15,832 --> 00:01:20,051
Wilson医生 这位是我的跟踪者

27
00:01:20,135 --> 00:01:21,965
你的等待室真糟

28
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,575
我不会治你的

29
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,645
什么 因为你是个玻璃?

30
00:01:25,714 --> 00:01:29,035
呃...我们不是... 呃...那个那个

31
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:31,518
他是不大愿意

32
00:01:31,784 --> 00:01:34,405
嗯 我们要走了 下班再见...

33
00:01:34,489 --> 00:01:36,927
不 不 不! 啊...

34
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,104
没人能诊断出我怎么了

35
00:01:42,622 --> 00:01:46,104
你看 你的衬衫领口有空隙 说明你在丧失体重 你在脸红

36
00:01:46,188 --> 00:01:48,461
那是发烧 而且你喘不过气

37
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:51,314
最后 你脸上有卡波西肉瘤(KS)病灶

38
00:01:51,398 --> 00:01:54,008
说明你患有HIV 你正发展成晚期AIDS

39
00:01:54,092 --> 00:01:57,112
你生病是因为我们的免疫系统被入侵了 而且有人对你擤鼻涕

40
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,440
我现在可以走了吗?

41
00:01:58,524 --> 00:02:02,416
好强啊 但我的免疫系统很好

42
00:02:02,528 --> 00:02:06,515
你的集中营体形师有问题 去重做你的T细胞计量

43
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,729
我已经做过了

44
00:02:07,813 --> 00:02:09,739
他们查了T细胞淋巴瘤?

45
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:11,062
阴性的

46
00:02:11,146 --> 00:02:14,243
这些都会吸引一个HIV专家的

47
00:02:14,462 --> 00:02:16,885
现在松开我的拐杖 不然它就是你的新男朋友

48
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:19,551
亲爱的 如果你看看我的档案 我就嫁给你

49
00:02:19,635 --> 00:02:21,411
国会说你不行 所以...

50
00:02:32,335 --> 00:02:33,761
我没碰他

51
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:37,062
他这是过敏性休克

52
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,188
2x07 - Hunting

53
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:13,391
- 去见Stacy. - 我们给他用了肾上腺素 他好了

54
00:03:13,475 --> 00:03:15,749
你需要一个律师 去见Stacy

55
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,002
你打了个病人

56
00:03:17,061 --> 00:03:18,560
4个字 两个错误

57
00:03:18,675 --> 00:03:20,428
他不是病人 而且我没打他

58
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:22,003
当然你没有 去见Stacy

59
00:03:22,087 --> 00:03:24,068
不是我造成的过敏反应

60
00:03:24,153 --> 00:03:26,651
可能是他的某种HIV药abacavir

61
00:03:26,735 --> 00:03:29,920
我会告诉急诊室医生让他们停药的

62
00:03:30,059 --> 00:03:31,047
去见Stacy

63
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,188
你必须治好他

64
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,649
以医学的标准来说这只是小菜一碟

65
00:03:36,734 --> 00:03:37,997
AIDS加感染

66
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:40,079
你不治他 他会指控你人身攻击

67
00:03:40,163 --> 00:03:42,537
只是他说我打他并不说明这是真的

68
00:03:42,673 --> 00:03:46,037
看 我正被裸体的啦啦队长们包围着

69
00:03:46,402 --> 00:03:47,438
明白了?

70
00:03:48,552 --> 00:03:51,475
虽然我喜欢今早的某些行动

71
00:03:51,996 --> 00:03:55,218
我忘了 周三 狂欢夜 这个可以等等!

72
00:03:56,514 --> 00:03:58,698
你让我来你家见你

73
00:03:59,002 --> 00:04:01,441
你老公碰巧不在

74
00:04:01,525 --> 00:04:03,071
Mark去理疗了

75
00:04:03,156 --> 00:04:05,365
我在等灭鼠公司

76
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:07,861
昨晚看见一只老鼠

77
00:04:08,217 --> 00:04:11,537
我很惊讶你居然还敢站在地上

78
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,080
我几乎没睡

79
00:04:13,164 --> 00:04:14,658
Mark去干吗了?

80
00:04:15,185 --> 00:04:20,117
我想想 快速攀登Gregory峰而你在一次猎海豹中一直打瞌睡 (本句翻译有疑点)

81
00:04:20,308 --> 00:04:21,885
打扑克 尖叫

82
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,427
你在干什么?

83
00:04:24,628 --> 00:04:26,426
抱歉 我快疯了

84
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,320
你讨厌洗盘子

85
00:04:29,983 --> 00:04:31,714
人是会变得

86
00:04:35,514 --> 00:04:38,931
我能让你夜里睡的像个宝宝

87
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:44,050
我宁愿自己来
I'd rather take care of it myself.

88
00:04:44,705 --> 00:04:46,320
我说的是老鼠
I was referring to the rat.

89
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,830
Trenton Pests会派一个家伙过来
Trenton Pest is sending a guy.

90
00:04:53,325 --> 00:04:54,597
怎么了?
<i>What's going on?</i>

91
00:04:57,386 --> 00:04:58,654
不是你想的那样
It's not what you think.

92
00:04:58,838 --> 00:05:01,856
我知道这看上去像我们俩在洗盘子 实际上 我们是在做爱
I know it looks like we're cleaning dishes,

93
00:05:00,108 --> 00:05:01,240
but actually, we're having sex.

94
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,979
我们在工作
We're working.

95
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,546
我好想自己也是个医生
Wow, wish I'd become a doctor.

96
00:05:05,631 --> 00:05:07,597
这地方还真干净
Place'd be spotless.

97
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:13,490
花十分钟 把这个家伙治好 不要叫唤了
Take ten minutes, cure the guy,

98
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,874
and stop whining.

99
00:05:15,787 --> 00:05:17,967
新病人Kalvin Ryan
I give you Kalvin Ryan.

100
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:21,882
人很浮夸 档案很无聊
So flamboyant in person, so boring on paper.

101
00:05:21,966 --> 00:05:26,783
很明显是机会性感染 可能是肺结核(TB)或者囊虫性肺炎(PCP)
Obviously got an opportunistic infection,

102
00:05:23,874 --> 00:05:26,707
probably TB or PCP.

103
00:05:27,553 --> 00:05:29,010
你看了他的病历了吗?
Have you read his file?

104
00:05:29,094 --> 00:05:32,597
我看了两眼 忽然发现那些文字没什么深度
I started, but I found the characters

105
00:05:30,974 --> 00:05:32,041
two-dimensional.

106
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:34,840
他上个星期去了个HIV门诊
He went to an HIV clinic last week.

107
00:05:35,023 --> 00:05:38,991
检查排除了肺结核 囊虫性肺炎(PCP) 鸟型分支杆菌群感染(MAC) 细胞巨化病毒(CMV) 单纯疱疹病毒(HSV)
Tested negative for TB, PCP, MAC, CMV, HSV.

108
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,035
不是感染
It's not an infection.

109
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:44,170
HIV门诊 就几个病人 赚那么多钱 重做检查
HIV clinic, so few patients, so much money.

110
00:05:44,254 --> 00:05:45,518
结果都讲的通
Redo the tests.

111
00:05:43,874 --> 00:05:45,108
The results make sense.

112
00:05:45,584 --> 00:05:48,723
Kalvin的T细胞水平有200 足够对付感染的了
Kalvin's T-cells are at 200.

113
00:05:46,974 --> 00:05:48,207
That's strong enough to fight infection.

114
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,176
好吧 寄生虫
Fine, parasite.

115
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,923
不是 粪便检验是阴性的
Nope, stool sample was negative.

116
00:05:53,028 --> 00:05:55,934
两个月前 他的T细胞降到30 然后他改吃别的药
Two months ago he was down to 30 T-cells.

117
00:05:56,018 --> 00:05:58,095
他的免疫系统反弹了 他的病毒拷贝数降低了 (病毒拷贝数 衡量HIV病毒数量的标准)
Then he changed his meds, his immune system rebounds,

118
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,108
his viral load drops.

119
00:05:58,179 --> 00:06:00,706
所有指标都在恢复正常 他的病情却越来越严重
Everything's getting better, but he's getting sicker.

120
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:06,220
直面现实吧  这个病例挺有趣
Face it, this might be an interesting case.

121
00:06:11,713 --> 00:06:15,501
有没有可能是他的免疫系统太强了
What if his immune system is too strong?

122
00:06:16,062 --> 00:06:19,273
自体免疫性疾病 和HIV一起 不可能
And autoimmune disease? With HIV, that's impossible.

123
00:06:19,741 --> 00:06:23,795
他的新HIV药物 唤醒了他原本沉睡的免疫系统
His new HIV meds kicked his system

124
00:06:21,907 --> 00:06:23,841
out of a sound sleep.

125
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:27,312
苏醒后饥饿 暴躁 到处找事
Wakes up hungry, cranky, spoiling for a fight.

126
00:06:27,396 --> 00:06:29,504
如果找不到主动感染源
When it doesn't find an active infection,

127
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,870
它就要开始攻击曾经的感染遗留下来的无害残余
it starts attacking the harmless remnants

128
00:06:31,173 --> 00:06:32,707
of old infections.

129
00:06:33,087 --> 00:06:35,462
免疫重建综合症
Immune Reconstitution Syndrome.

130
00:06:35,588 --> 00:06:39,426
他的药物让他的病情过于好转 搞得他病了
His meds made him so much better,

131
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,273
he made himself sick.

132
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:41,872
- 听来很... - 无聊!
Sounds pretty--

133
00:06:40,374 --> 00:06:41,440
Boring!

134
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,616
真的很无聊
<i>This is so not interesting.</i>

135
00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:47,117
X光胸透寻找可能的旧感染 给他用类固醇
Chest x-ray to find the old infections.

136
00:06:45,173 --> 00:06:46,173
Start him on steroids.

137
00:06:51,522 --> 00:06:55,007
如果你错了 类固醇就会把他的免疫系统毁了的 病情会加重的
If you're wrong, steroids will tank

138
00:06:52,807 --> 00:06:53,641
his immune system.

139
00:06:55,074 --> 00:06:57,227
那样才有意思
He'll get worse.

140
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:56,807
Now that would be interesting.

141
00:06:57,336 --> 00:06:58,287
可密定(抗凝血剂)在哪里?
Where's theCoumadinCoumandin?

142
00:06:58,371 --> 00:07:01,376
如果你的病人血液有问题 那血液稀释剂就不是...
<i>If your patient's</i> <i>got a blood problem,</i>

143
00:06:59,674 --> 00:07:01,540
then blood thinner's aren't exactly...

144
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,492
是给Stacy的老鼠用的 得血栓病死的
It's for Stacey's rat.

145
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,008
Death by anticoagulation.

146
00:07:05,576 --> 00:07:09,704
靠杀一只动物来赢回Stacy...
Trying to win Stacy back by killing an animal.

147
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,952
太原始人了
Very caveman.

148
00:07:11,053 --> 00:07:12,913
我不想要她回来
I don't want her back.

149
00:07:13,061 --> 00:07:15,398
我只是想让她承认对我的感觉
I just want her to admit her feelings for me.

150
00:07:15,482 --> 00:07:21,199
我去找Cuddy Cuddy炒了她或者给她换岗 我都会高兴
<i>I go to Cuddy.</i>

151
00:07:16,841 --> 00:07:19,607
Cuddy fires her or reassigns her.

152
00:07:19,674 --> 00:07:21,340
<i>Either way, I'm happy.</i>

153
00:07:21,921 --> 00:07:27,758
如果你想她回来 要么你告诉她... 要么 更好的办法 闭嘴...
If you want her back,

154
00:07:22,574 --> 00:07:24,607
<i>either tell her...</i>

155
00:07:24,674 --> 00:07:27,440
Or better yet, shut up...

156
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,889
然后像其他人一样哭到睡着
and cry yourself to sleep like everybody else.

157
00:07:29,973 --> 00:07:33,874
嗨 我是Mark Warner Spring大街1724号
Hi, this is Mark Warner.

158
00:07:31,641 --> 00:07:33,507
<i>1724 Spring Street.</i>

159
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:37,109
听着 你们不需要派那个人来了 我们抓住他了(老鼠)
Uh, listen, you don't need to send that guy down.

160
00:07:35,207 --> 00:07:36,507
We caught him.

161
00:07:37,493 --> 00:07:41,051
不 你应该把帐单送到普林斯顿Plainsboro医院
<i>No, you should</i> <i>send the bill</i>

162
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,008
to Princeton Plainsboro Hospital.

163
00:07:41,135 --> 00:07:43,512
James Wilson医生收
Attention Dr. James Wilson. Yeah.

164
00:07:43,513 --> 00:07:44,694
对

165
00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:51,523
你的淋巴结没有肿胀 好事
Your lymph nodes aren't swollen, that's good.

166
00:07:51,862 --> 00:07:53,945
也许Chase医生应该检查一下
<i>Maybe Dr. Chase</i> <i>should check.</i>

167
00:07:54,511 --> 00:07:56,878
抱歉 抽不出手来
Sorry, my hand's full.

168
00:07:57,254 --> 00:08:00,638
他太帅了 没有安全感 你做过模特吗?
He's too pretty to be straight.

169
00:07:58,807 --> 00:08:00,108
You ever done any modeling?

170
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,648
难道有人整天想着做模特吗?
Does anyone actually fall for that line?

171
00:08:02,714 --> 00:08:06,015
每天都有 你想我为什么会成为一个摄影师?
Every day.

172
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:05,440
Why do you think I became a photographer?

173
00:08:06,163 --> 00:08:10,489
我在想你们这些家伙 在上班的时候没有考虑过约会的事
I'm guessing you guys didn't think about dating

174
00:08:08,474 --> 00:08:09,374
on career day.

175
00:08:12,057 --> 00:08:14,211
- 我喜欢我的工作 - 真的?
I love my job.

176
00:08:12,674 --> 00:08:14,108
Really?

177
00:08:14,277 --> 00:08:18,652
你看上去像那种 “发现做医生能给自己异常的满足”的类型
You seem more the

178
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,307
"find it exceptionally satisfying" type.

179
00:08:19,422 --> 00:08:21,379
我不确定这有什么区别
I'm not sure there's a difference.

180
00:08:21,463 --> 00:08:24,235
你妈妈是因为糖尿病死的 你爸爸的身体怎么样?
Your mom died of diabetes.

181
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,348
最后一次听说 他得了肝硬化
How's your dad's health?

182
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,140
Last I heard, he had cirrhosis.

183
00:08:26,433 --> 00:08:34,030
喜欢就是喜欢 满足感是社会认定 娱乐可以等待
Love is love.

184
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:31,741
Satisfying is social validation.

185
00:08:31,807 --> 00:08:33,207
Fun can wait.

186
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:35,499
我喜欢这个
I have fun.

187
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,059
对 她已经订好2月的计划了
Yeah, she's got some scheduled for February.

188
00:08:38,144 --> 00:08:40,194
你上一次听到你爸爸的事?
Last you heard of your father?

189
00:08:40,258 --> 00:08:42,226
我16岁被他赶出家门
He threw me out when I was 16.

190
00:08:42,372 --> 00:08:47,100
也就是那一次 我当时过生日不想再要玩具枪了 想出去来顿烧烤
It's just as well.

191
00:08:42,841 --> 00:08:45,041
I got tired of getting BB guns for my birthday

192
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,641
when I'd asked for a Barbie.

193
00:08:47,488 --> 00:08:49,476
爸爸可以成为真正的情人
Dads can be real sweethearts.

194
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:52,758
嗯 机敏 可爱
Mmm, sensitive <i>and</i> cute.

195
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,009
他很可爱
He's cute.

196
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:07,759
它跑到那个油烟机口去了
He ran into that heating vent right there.

197
00:09:10,721 --> 00:09:13,641
希望Mark最后能消除怒火
Hopefully Mark's anger will go away eventually.

198
00:09:13,707 --> 00:09:15,967
他没有生气 他只是不喜欢你
He's not angry, he just doesn't like you.

199
00:09:16,052 --> 00:09:17,698
这儿没什么特别的
Nothing unique there.

200
00:09:17,782 --> 00:09:20,281
他看上去对你也不是很狂野
Didn't seem really wild about you either.

201
00:09:21,192 --> 00:09:22,683
他和我很好
He's fine with me.

202
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,843
他很生气 他在治疗小组里说的
He's angry. He said so in group.

203
00:09:25,927 --> 00:09:29,417
他当然生气 他要做好几个月痛苦的理疗
Of course he's angry.

204
00:09:26,974 --> 00:09:28,374
He's looking at months of painful physio.

205
00:09:29,501 --> 00:09:31,519
他在生你的气
He's mad at you.

206
00:09:31,603 --> 00:09:33,528
他不可能这样说
There's no way he said that.

207
00:09:34,732 --> 00:09:39,489
不会 但却是事实

208
00:09:36,273 --> 00:09:38,540
No. But it's true.

209
00:09:39,809 --> 00:09:42,545
他嫉妒你可以走路
He resents you for being able to walk.

210
00:09:46,705 --> 00:09:48,316
我也曾经这样
I've been there.

211
00:09:51,735 --> 00:09:54,694
我嫉妒你了好长一段时间
I resented you for a hell of a long time.

212
00:09:55,848 --> 00:09:58,068
过去式?
Past tense?

213
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,781
可能是医院打来的
Might be the hospital.

214
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:16,768
什么!?
What?

215
00:10:16,887 --> 00:10:19,369
不是时候? 你在哪里?
Bad time? Where are you?

216
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,676
在你女朋友的家里 别管那些叫床声
<i>(House)</i> <i>At your girlfriend's place.</i>

217
00:10:20,874 --> 00:10:22,507
<i>Ignore the moaning</i> <i>and squeaking.</i>

218
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,094
他的肺胆子太小了 不告诉我们是什么感染引发了他的免疫重建
His lungs are too scarred to tell which infection

219
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,041
triggered the immune reconstitution.

220
00:10:27,396 --> 00:10:28,755
他吸烟吗?
He a smoker?

221
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:31,378
对 而且可能不只抽烟
<i>(Cameron)</i> <i>Yes, and possibly more</i> <i>than cigarettes.</i>

222
00:10:31,462 --> 00:10:34,593
毒理检验证实 他曾经使用违禁药物
His tox screen came back positive

223
00:10:32,774 --> 00:10:34,641
for recreational drugs.

224
00:10:34,677 --> 00:10:37,303
没什么奇怪的 也不关诊断的事
<i>(House)</i> <i>Not surprising,</i> <i>not medically relevant.</i>

225
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:38,898
他的心脏看上去有点肥大
His heart looks a little enlarged.

226
00:10:38,982 --> 00:10:41,469
典型的艾滋病药物副作用
<i>(House)</i> <i>That's a typical</i> <i>side effect of AZT.</i>

227
00:10:41,554 --> 00:10:43,575
Kalvin近期的感染都是什么?
<i>What were Kalvin's</i> <i>most recent infections?</i>

228
00:10:43,641 --> 00:10:46,224
弓形虫(Toxo) 细胞巨化病毒(CMV)和囊虫性肺炎(PCP)
Toxo, CMV, and PCP.

229
00:10:49,124 --> 00:10:51,993
让我们假设就是其中一个
[whispering] Well, let's assume it's one of those.

230
00:10:52,077 --> 00:10:54,286
用更昔洛韦对付细胞巨化病毒感染(CMV)...
<i>Give me ganciclovir</i> <i>for CMV...</i>

231
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,399
我们根本听不到你说什么 你在哪里?
We can hardly hear you. Where are you?

232
00:10:56,483 --> 00:11:00,136
阁楼里 你女朋友的另外一个男朋友出现了
<i>In a closet.</i>

233
00:10:57,207 --> 00:11:01,273
Your girlfriend's other boyfriend showed up.

234
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,045
更昔洛韦治疗细胞巨化病毒感染(CMV)
Ganciclovir for the CMV.

235
00:11:04,442 --> 00:11:09,636
磺胺嘧啶治疗弓形虫(Toxo) Bactrim治疗囊虫性肺炎(PCP)
Sulfadiazine for the toxo.

236
00:11:06,841 --> 00:11:10,507
Bactrim for PCP.

237
00:11:11,054 --> 00:11:14,664
得挂了 杀戮时间
Gotta go.

238
00:11:12,374 --> 00:11:14,474
It's killin' time.

239
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,642
你的毒理检验结果显示...
<i>(Cameron)</i> <i>Your tox screen</i> <i>came back positive for...</i>

240
00:11:44,726 --> 00:11:48,519
甲安菲他明和摇头丸阳性
Crystal meth and ecstasy.

241
00:11:48,743 --> 00:11:52,363
违禁药物是危险的 但对于HIV患者...
Recreational drugs are dangerous to begin with.

242
00:11:50,707 --> 00:11:52,374
But for someone with HIV...

243
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:55,144
我没有把他们错当维生素吃
I didn't mistake them for vitamins.

244
00:11:55,198 --> 00:11:57,586
我喜欢P&P
I'm a PNP boy.

245
00:11:57,587 --> 00:12:00,053
狂欢作乐(Party & Play)
Party 'N' Play.

246
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:02,371
毒品和做爱
Drugs and sex.

247
00:12:07,772 --> 00:12:09,594
你好像不大喜欢?
You don't approve.

248
00:12:09,407 --> 00:12:11,874
Does the sex include condoms?

249
00:12:11,112 --> 00:12:13,300
你用安全套吗?
If he's negative, sure.

250
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:16,844
如果我主动 当然 如果他主动...

251
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,674
If he's positive...

252
00:12:17,786 --> 00:12:19,959
都淋湿了干嘛再穿雨衣?
why put on a raincoat if you're already wet?

253
00:12:20,043 --> 00:12:22,423
你这样可能会感染肺炎 或者其他种类的HIV病毒
You could get hepatitis or another strain of HIV.

254
00:12:22,507 --> 00:12:23,791
或者我会被汽车撞死
Or I could get hit by a bus.

255
00:12:23,858 --> 00:12:25,497
艾滋病不再是死刑判决了
AIDS isn't a death sentence anymore.

256
00:12:25,581 --> 00:12:27,947
我不想有遗憾
I don't wanna have any regrets.

257
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,281
你咳嗽多长时间了?
How long have you been coughing?

258
00:12:34,851 --> 00:12:40,548
啊...大概一个小时
Uh, about an hour or so.

259
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,306
深呼吸
Try to take a deep breath.

260
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:46,384
什么东西?
What is it?

261
00:12:46,872 --> 00:12:48,396
我想这是血
I think it's blood.

262
00:13:00,909 --> 00:13:03,860
我建议你接受暴露后治疗
?????? hylaxis.

263
00:13:03,944 --> 00:13:06,139
你被传染的可能微乎其微
Your chances of conversion are slim,

264
00:13:06,224 --> 00:13:09,885
不过我还是想开给你三种药
<i>but I'd like to put</i> <i>you on three</i>

265
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,807
<i>anti-viral medications.</i>

266
00:13:10,072 --> 00:13:14,279
Finavir zidovudine和lamivudine (都是抗病毒药物)
<i>Nalphenovair,</i> <i>Zedovudine,</i>

267
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,407
<i>and Lamivudine.</i>

268
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:19,480
它们都有副作用 头疼 反胃 噩梦
<i>There are side-effects.</i>

269
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,474
<i>Headache, nausea,</i> <i>vivid dreaming.</i>

270
00:13:19,564 --> 00:13:26,028
你要分别在6周后 3个月后 6个月后进行HIV测试...
<i>You'll be tested for HIV</i> <i>at six weeks, three months,</i>

271
00:13:23,173 --> 00:13:27,207
<i>six months...</i>

272
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:31,307
Very interesting.

273
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,419
太有意思了

274
00:13:31,521 --> 00:13:36,042
他咳出的血溅进了Cameron的眼睛和嘴里 这有意思?
He coughs infected blood in Cameron's eyes and mouth.

275
00:13:36,213 --> 00:13:39,570
我说的是他咳嗽那部分 不是说Cameron什么什么的
<i>That's interesting.</i>

276
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,841
The coughing part, not the "in Cameron" part.

277
00:13:39,654 --> 00:13:43,222
新的症状 肺部血管破裂
New symptom.

278
00:13:40,574 --> 00:13:42,741
Blood vessel ruptured in his lung.

279
00:13:43,306 --> 00:13:44,856
我已经止住血了
I closed the tear.

280
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,954
这样一来就把免疫重建给排除了
Well, it takes immune reconstitution

281
00:13:46,374 --> 00:13:47,941
off the table.

282
00:13:48,038 --> 00:13:49,868
那把什么给展示出来了呢?
What's it put on the table?

283
00:13:50,903 --> 00:13:53,518
好了 她又不在 你们不用扮演好孩子了
It's okay, she's not here.

284
00:13:51,907 --> 00:13:53,407
You can skip the nice guy acts.

285
00:13:53,602 --> 00:13:56,961
你要知道 人类是有感情的动物
You know, some human beings

286
00:13:54,807 --> 00:13:56,140
are actually capable of human feelings.

287
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:00,001
我关不关心她也不会改变未来要发生的事
My giving a damn or not is not gonna

288
00:13:58,574 --> 00:14:00,108
change what happened.

289
00:14:00,085 --> 00:14:02,040
可能是卡波西肉瘤(KS)
Could be Goodpasture's syndrome.

290
00:14:02,232 --> 00:14:04,348
没有水肿 没有血尿
No edema. No bloody urine.

291
00:14:04,432 --> 00:14:07,842
脸上有卡波西肉瘤(KS) 那肺里也有可能有 病灶处出血
KS on his face could mean KS in his lungs

292
00:14:07,926 --> 00:14:10,326
那我在修复他肺部的破裂时应该能看到的
with bleeding from the lesions.

293
00:14:07,607 --> 00:14:08,741
I would have seen them when I repaired

294
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,173
the tear in his lung.

295
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,078
Wegener肉芽肿?
Wegener's granulomatosis?

296
00:14:12,164 --> 00:14:14,563
那就会对类固醇类药物产生反应了
<i>Wegener's would have</i> <i>responded to steroids.</i>

297
00:14:16,068 --> 00:14:17,941
你应该回家去休息一下
Maybe you should go home, take the rest of the day.

298
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:19,183
我没事
<i>I'm fine.</i>

299
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:26,058
哦 真不错 他假装关心 你假装不在意
Oh, this is good.

300
00:14:22,607 --> 00:14:25,207
He's pretending to care, you're pretending not to.

301
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:29,928
我想我们应该重新考虑毒品的问题 Kalvin用过甲安非他明结晶
I think we should reconsider drugs.

302
00:14:28,008 --> 00:14:29,307
Kalvin uses crystal meth.

303
00:14:30,795 --> 00:14:33,276
因为关心自己的健康跟踪我
Concerned enough about his health to stalk me,

304
00:14:33,425 --> 00:14:36,801
同时用着这些致命的药
while indulging in deadly street drugs.

305
00:14:36,872 --> 00:14:38,859
可以写一篇矛盾论的论文了
A study in contradictions.

306
00:14:39,277 --> 00:14:41,430
很有趣 但是医学上还是不相关
Interesting, still not medically relevant.

307
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:43,963
有可能是他的药物被污染了
It could be if his drugs were tainted.

308
00:14:44,063 --> 00:14:46,887
他们用电池酸液 碱和燃油制造毒品...
They cook meth with battery acid,

309
00:14:45,474 --> 00:14:46,807
lye, lantern fuel.

310
00:14:46,984 --> 00:14:49,635
找到Kalvin的药 查查有没有毒
Find Kalvin's pills, test for toxins.

311
00:14:48,807 --> 00:14:51,974
Foreman, you're with me.

312
00:14:50,578 --> 00:14:53,515
Foreman 你跟我来

313
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,479
我还有个病例 需要会诊
I need a consult on another case.

314
00:15:00,587 --> 00:15:01,590
我们还有病例?
We have another case?

315
00:15:01,674 --> 00:15:03,776
私下的交易
It's a hip-pocket deal.

316
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:06,543
病人送来时处于一种奇特的抬颈状态
Patient presents with a distinct neck tilt.

317
00:15:06,628 --> 00:15:08,943
斜颈 他是个运动员?
Wry neck. Is he an athlete?

318
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,643
他是个赛跑选手
He's a regular runner.

319
00:15:10,727 --> 00:15:12,468
运动时有没有痛感
Any pain associated with movement?

320
00:15:12,532 --> 00:15:14,610
他没提到过
None that he's complained of.

321
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:18,509
最好的可能性 耳部或肺部的感染
Best case scenario,

322
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:18,273
an infection in the ear or lungs.

323
00:15:18,574 --> 00:15:20,539
最坏的 脑干肿瘤
Worst case, brain stem tumor.

324
00:15:20,626 --> 00:15:23,271
应该做核磁共振 CT扫描 全套的检查手段
Should do an MRI, CAT scan, full workup.

325
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,327
嗯...我不这么想
Uh, I don't think so. No insurance.

326
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:28,408
病人没有保险

327
00:15:32,175 --> 00:15:35,752
这里没有毒品 我去查查浴室
No drugs in here.

328
00:15:33,774 --> 00:15:34,574
I'll take the bathroom.

329
00:15:37,407 --> 00:15:40,597
下班后去喝一杯如何? 不要想已经发生的事了
How about a drink after work?

330
00:15:38,607 --> 00:15:41,807
Take your mind off what happened.

331
00:15:45,973 --> 00:15:47,174
Cameron?
Cameron?

332
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,536
我可能感染了HIV 喝一次酒不会把它冲走的
I might have HIV.

333
00:15:48,474 --> 00:15:50,108
A drink's not gonna wash it away.

334
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,302
你被感染的机会基本上是零
There's, like, zero chance of you

335
00:15:51,507 --> 00:15:52,874
contracting the virus.

336
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:55,941
"基本上是零" 和 "零" 之间有很大区别
Big difference between like zero and zero.

337
00:15:56,712 --> 00:15:59,193
感染控制中心的家伙是怎么给你说的?
What did the infection control guy tell you?

338
00:15:59,746 --> 00:16:05,280
那个人还算不错 一直在提醒我医院会报销我所有的费用
He was very reassuring.

339
00:16:01,507 --> 00:16:02,707
Kept reminding me that the hospital

340
00:16:02,774 --> 00:16:05,307
covers all my medical costs.

341
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:07,712
不过很明显他忘了告诉我 如果我的结果是阳性
Apparently forgot to mention that if I do test positive,

342
00:16:07,796 --> 00:16:12,137
他们就会移交给法律部处理 法律部会想方设法挖掘我所有的污点 用来证明我...
that they'll pass it on to legal.

343
00:16:08,607 --> 00:16:10,273
And legal will dig up any dirt they can

344
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,440
trying to prove that I'm a...

345
00:16:12,308 --> 00:16:16,042
吸毒或者行为不检 所以我感染了HIV
drug user or a tramp and that's why I have HIV.

346
00:16:16,126 --> 00:16:18,589
他们什么也找不到的 是不是?
It's not like they're gonna find anything, right?

347
00:16:17,774 --> 00:16:20,207
Right.

348
00:16:19,342 --> 00:16:20,634
对
Check this out.

349
00:16:21,538 --> 00:16:23,108
看看这个
<i>Kalvin's a photographer.</i>

350
00:16:23,412 --> 00:16:26,013
Kalvin是一个摄影师 这些坏了的东西都是些小道具
<i>The broken bulbs</i> <i>were props.</i>

351
00:16:26,196 --> 00:16:28,307
玻璃是30年代的荧光玻璃
The glass is from 1930s fluorescents.

352
00:16:28,391 --> 00:16:29,595
有些东西上还盖了日期邮戳
Some of the bulbs are date-stamped.

353
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:32,675
二次大战前荧光制品含有大量的铍元素
Pre-World War II, fluorescent bulbs contained

354
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:36,501
铍元素的粉末损坏肺部 使肺硬化 病人不能呼吸
large amounts of beryllium.

355
00:16:32,507 --> 00:16:34,108
Beryllium dust inflames the lungs,

356
00:16:34,173 --> 00:16:35,741
they get rigid, patient can't breathe.

357
00:16:38,088 --> 00:16:41,474
我爸爸曾经和人合写过一篇关于急性铍中毒的论文
My father co-authored a paper

358
00:16:39,607 --> 00:16:40,641
on acute berylliosis.

359
00:16:41,532 --> 00:16:44,764
唉! 有一瞬间我还以为你很聪明呢
Phew!

360
00:16:42,707 --> 00:16:45,207
For a moment there, I thought you were smart.

361
00:16:45,258 --> 00:16:48,175
Cameron 给Kalvin的肺做活检
<i>Cameron, get a biopsy</i> <i>of Kalvin's lung tissue.</i>

362
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,718
用光谱仪分析一下
Run a spectrographic analysis.

363
00:16:49,802 --> 00:16:50,668
我可以做
I can handle it.

364
00:16:50,794 --> 00:16:53,507
没必要让整个团队冒险
No reason to risk exposing the entire team.

365
00:16:53,695 --> 00:16:55,644
我到时折磨谁去?
Then who would I torment?

366
00:17:01,871 --> 00:17:03,377
抱歉
I'm sorry... about what happened.

367
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,651
对于刚发生的一切
It's best not to talk.

368
00:17:05,861 --> 00:17:07,882
最好不要说话
You'll feel a sharp pinch.

369
00:17:08,876 --> 00:17:10,884
你会感到剧烈的阵痛

370
00:17:10,981 --> 00:17:14,167
这实际上就是抓取一部分你的肺部组织
This actually is gonna grab a piece of your lung.

371
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:22,180
你们在我的房间里找什么?
What were you guys looking for at my hotel?

372
00:17:22,305 --> 00:17:26,410
你的药 我们认为你可能吃了有毒的药
Your drugs.

373
00:17:23,607 --> 00:17:25,774
Thought maybe you'd used toxic meth.

374
00:17:26,674 --> 00:17:29,448
几个小时后我们就会知道你是不是铍中毒
We'll know if you were exposed to beryllium

375
00:17:27,774 --> 00:17:29,207
in a few hours.

376
00:17:29,532 --> 00:17:34,801
如果你们还是很好奇 ... 就在那边的椅子上我的包里
Well, if you're still curious,

377
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:35,108
it's in my bag over there on the chair.

378
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:38,063
你把毒品带进医院?!
You brought drugs into the hospital?

379
00:17:38,498 --> 00:17:40,792
白跑到你房间里找了一通
Glad I wasted my time at your hotel.

380
00:17:40,876 --> 00:17:43,776
我告诉你了我用过的 你又没问我要
<i>I told you I used.</i>

381
00:17:41,874 --> 00:17:43,841
<i>You didn't ask me</i> <i>for a sample.</i>

382
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:48,005
你不是因为这件事生气 你生气是因为我把血咳到你脸上了
You're not pissed about this.

383
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:47,240
You're mad because I coughed blood on you.

384
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:49,078
那只是个意外
That was an accident.

385
00:17:49,162 --> 00:17:54,425
能不能不要装好人了 没用的 更糟的是 很无聊的
Stop being nice, it's useless.

386
00:17:52,307 --> 00:17:53,807
And worse, it's boring.

387
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:57,351
生气吧! 我蠢了一次 结果染上HIV
<i>Get angry.</i>

388
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:56,173
<i>I had one stupid night.</i>

389
00:17:57,435 --> 00:18:00,239
你知不知道我有多生气?
I end up with HIV.

390
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,273
Do you have any idea how pissed-off I was?

391
00:18:00,841 --> 00:18:02,674
这不是你的错
This wasn't your fault.

392
00:18:08,874 --> 00:18:12,874
You broke into my house?

393
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,511
你破门进来的?

394
00:18:12,928 --> 00:18:15,302
没办法 Mark不在家
Well, I had to. Mark isn't here.

395
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,663
他去理疗了
He has physio.

396
00:18:16,747 --> 00:18:18,328
噢 真的? 他怎么样了?
Oh, really? How's he doing?

397
00:18:18,412 --> 00:18:20,309
这些奶酪是怎么回事?
What happened with all the cheese?

398
00:18:20,406 --> 00:18:23,865
Steve McQueen吃掉可嘧啶之前必须把它们藏起来
Well, I had to get rid of it before Steve McQueen

399
00:18:21,641 --> 00:18:22,607
ate any Coumadin.

400
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,245
我给你的老鼠起的名字
I named your rat.

401
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:32,307
Steve's tilting his head.

402
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,867
Steve的脑袋歪了

403
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:37,581
随便哪个神经科医生都会告诉你 这是感染或者脑干肿瘤
Any neurologist will tell you

404
00:18:34,607 --> 00:18:36,841
that suggests an infection or a brain stem tumor.

405
00:18:37,665 --> 00:18:39,739
死了就不用担心了
Death cures both those things.

406
00:18:39,823 --> 00:18:41,427
我们不能杀了他
Oh, we can't kill him.

407
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:45,673
如果是感染 可能是你屋里的某样东西引起的
If it's an infection,

408
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,974
it could be caused by something in your house.

409
00:18:45,979 --> 00:18:48,486
也有可能影响你们
Something that could affect you guys.

410
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:51,879
闻一闻
Smell this.

411
00:18:53,075 --> 00:18:55,278
- 像不像尿? - 恶!
Does it smell like urine?

412
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:54,841
Oh!

413
00:18:56,613 --> 00:18:58,504
你丢了芦笋吗?
You missing any asparagus?

414
00:18:59,794 --> 00:19:05,404
好了 把这个塞满 如果他没有好转 那就是肿瘤
Okay, stuff these.

415
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:05,607
If he doesn't get better, then it's a tumor.

416
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,648
然后呢? 化疗?
Then what, chemo?

417
00:19:09,063 --> 00:19:11,189
秃头的Steve McQueen?
Steve McQueen without hair?

418
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:14,016
它会宁可英年早逝的
It's a blessing he died young.

419
00:19:21,466 --> 00:19:22,655
你好
Hello.

420
00:19:23,823 --> 00:19:29,058
嗨 亲爱的 抱歉我错过你了 对 我回家了
Oh, hi, honey.

421
00:19:25,841 --> 00:19:27,707
I'm sorry I missed you. Yeah.

422
00:19:29,238 --> 00:19:32,576
好 几分钟后见
<i>I came home.</i>

423
00:19:29,173 --> 00:19:30,674
<i>All right, I'll see you</i> <i>in a few minutes.</i>

424
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,175
好 再见
Okay. Bye, hon.

425
00:19:49,212 --> 00:19:51,179
胸部很疼!
Chest hurts.

426
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:53,499
心律100并且还在攀升 可能是过敏反应
Heart rate's 100 and climbing.

427
00:19:51,974 --> 00:19:53,207
Could be an allergic reaction.

428
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:56,504
颈部动脉鼓胀 肯定是心包膜积水
Neck veins are up.

429
00:19:54,407 --> 00:19:55,173
Must be pericardial effusion.

430
00:19:57,632 --> 00:19:58,632
没有呼吸音
No wheezing.

431
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,564
他肺部的破裂肯定又开了
The tear in his lungs must have re-opened.

432
00:20:01,025 --> 00:20:04,045
Kalvin 你的心脏周围在充血
Kalvin, you're bleeding into the area around your heart.

433
00:20:04,129 --> 00:20:06,717
我要死了? 我不能呼吸!
I'm dying. I can't breathe.

434
00:20:06,801 --> 00:20:10,298
血液在冲击你的心脏 等我们把血液转移走 你就会没事了
The blood's crushing your heart.

435
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,273
<i>Once we remove it,</i> <i>you'll be fine.</i>

436
00:20:10,382 --> 00:20:12,372
如果我死了 请告诉我爸爸...
If I die, please tell my dad...

437
00:20:12,456 --> 00:20:13,827
你不会死
You're not going to die.

438
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:16,955
...告诉...他...对不起
Tell him sorry.

439
00:20:28,865 --> 00:20:30,154
血呢?
Where's the blood?

440
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:32,348
没有血
It's clear.

441
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,946
只剩下一种可能
??????

442
00:20:35,253 --> 00:20:36,849
心脏里有肿瘤
?????

443
00:20:43,087 --> 00:20:47,258
CT扫描证明Kalvin的心脏里有异常物质 肺中也有几个小的
?????

444
00:20:45,508 --> 00:20:47,441
and several smaller ones in his lungs.

445
00:20:47,342 --> 00:20:49,599
那就是为什么他的心脏肥大了 不是艾滋病药物
That's why his heart's enlarged.

446
00:20:49,683 --> 00:20:50,879
你没事吧?
Not the AZT.

447
00:20:49,474 --> 00:20:51,007
You okay?

448
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,873
她没事 可能已经开始厌烦这个问题了
<i>(House)</i> <i>She's fine.</i>

449
00:20:52,274 --> 00:20:53,807
Probably getting bored with the question.

450
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:56,900
心脏和肺部的异常物质 可能是是什么癌症?
Masses in the heart and lungs.

451
00:20:55,307 --> 00:20:56,740
kind of cancer are we looking at?

452
00:20:56,984 --> 00:20:58,181
不一定就是癌症
They may not be cacancerous.

453
00:20:58,265 --> 00:21:00,269
这是典型的非霍奇金症淋巴癌
This is classic non-Hodgkins lymphoma.

454
00:21:00,354 --> 00:21:02,384
HIV阳性的病人外加心脏中有异常物质
HIV positive patient with a primary heart mass?

455
00:21:02,468 --> 00:21:03,796
可能是肉状瘤
It could be sarcoidosis.

456
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,606
肺部活检显示正常
His lung tissue is negative.

457
00:21:06,417 --> 00:21:08,866
淋巴瘤就是死刑 肉状瘤可以治愈的
Lymphoma's a death sentence, sarcoidosis is treatable.

458
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:12,395
那耳朵也应该有感染 但那个也不是阳性...
So's an ear infection.

459
00:21:10,608 --> 00:21:12,174
Since he didn't test positive for that either.

460
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,680
我想做一下Kveim-siltzbach测试
I wanna do the Kveim Siltzbach test.

461
00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:21,147
你知道那样的话Cuddy要签多少份文件吗?

462
00:21:17,374 --> 00:21:19,274
Do you have any idea how much paperwork

463
00:21:19,341 --> 00:21:20,141
Cuddy's gonna need signed?

464
00:21:24,757 --> 00:21:26,244
去做吧
Do it.

465
00:21:29,851 --> 00:21:31,237
对了...
So...

466
00:21:32,468 --> 00:21:34,457
病人的爸爸是怎么回事?
how is the patient's father?

467
00:21:35,311 --> 00:21:35,816
嗯...
"Tell my dad I'm sorry."

468
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,916
告诉我爸爸我对不起他?

469
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,044
可能当年把老爷子给惹毛了
Might as well have waved a red flag at a bull.

470
00:21:41,144 --> 00:21:42,634
他不会来的
He's not coming.

471
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,488
还好不算是悲剧
Well, it's not a tragedy.

472
00:21:45,998 --> 00:21:48,958
爸爸不想见他 他也不想见爸爸
Dad doesn't wanna see him, he doesn't wanna see the dad.

473
00:21:49,097 --> 00:21:51,079
你是唯一一个希望他们见面的
You're the only one who wants them together.

474
00:21:51,163 --> 00:21:54,148
- 他说的! - 他认为自己要死了
He asked--

475
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,342
人之将死 一样说谎 (老黑的翻译 一字不改放上来)
He thought he was dying. Dying people lie too.

476
00:21:56,530 --> 00:22:01,472
希望他们工作少点 希望他们人变好些 希望他们为小猫们开孤儿院
Wished they'd worked less.

477
00:21:57,007 --> 00:21:59,773
They'd been nicer.

478
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,740
They'd opened orphanages for kittens.

479
00:22:01,662 --> 00:22:06,259
如果你真的想做些什么 做吧 别存着了
If you really wanna do something,

480
00:22:02,874 --> 00:22:04,608
<i>you do it.</i>

481
00:22:04,673 --> 00:22:08,341
You don't save it for a sound bite.

482
00:22:09,254 --> 00:22:11,852
如果你要死了 你会说什么?
What did you say when you thought you were dying?

483
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,179
另一方面讲
On the other hand...

484
00:22:18,206 --> 00:22:20,402
他爸爸抛弃了他
His dad tossed him out.

485
00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:23,475
他为什么要道歉呢?
So what's our guy want to apologize for?

486
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,561
每个人都有遗憾
Everybody has regrets.

487
00:22:32,629 --> 00:22:35,949
如果你心脏和肺部的组织是肉状瘤
If the growths in your lungs and heart are sarcoid,

488
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:38,376
你的身体就会认出这个
your body will recognize this material.

489
00:22:38,671 --> 00:22:41,088
我们会在你的胳膊上看到反应
And we'll see a reaction on your arm.

490
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:45,651
你真的想见你的爸爸?
Did you really want to see your dad?

491
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,378
你给他打电话了?
You called him?

492
00:22:50,189 --> 00:22:51,596
谢谢
Thanks.

493
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:55,648
他会来 试着让我变好
He would've come and tried to straighten me out.

494
00:22:55,982 --> 00:22:57,694
你怎么样了?
How are you holding up?

495
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,545
- 我很好 - 真可信
I'm fine.

496
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,174
Convincing.

497
00:23:02,029 --> 00:23:03,726
我的药你们怎么处理了?
What'd you do with my drugs?

498
00:23:04,026 --> 00:23:06,187
实验室分析完了就扔掉了
The lab disposes of them after analysis.

499
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,651
可惜
Too bad.

500
00:23:08,001 --> 00:23:10,006
也许对你有点用呢
They could have done you some good.

501
00:23:11,158 --> 00:23:13,102
我可不喜欢那个
They're not really my thing.

502
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,502
你要知道 我不希望你吃那个玩意儿 但...
You know, I hope you don't have it.

503
00:23:18,853 --> 00:23:23,114
但是感染HIV病毒可能是发生在我身上的最好的事了
But getting HIV might have been

504
00:23:20,474 --> 00:23:22,141
the best thing that ever happened to me.

505
00:23:24,378 --> 00:23:26,288
我曾经是个好孩子
I used to be a good boy.

506
00:23:26,372 --> 00:23:29,335
从不想惹别人生气...
Never wanted to piss anybody off.

507
00:23:30,217 --> 00:23:35,730
遵纪守法 助人为乐
<i>Playing by the rules</i> <i>makes everybody else happy.</i>

508
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,926
现在 我很快乐
Now <i>I'm</i> happy.

509
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:46,664
就是说只有他做理疗的时候 你才会出现?
So you just show up every time he's at physio?

510
00:23:46,748 --> 00:23:52,584
当然不是! 他去集体治疗小组 或者和朋友出去吃饭的时候也去
Of course not.

511
00:23:49,074 --> 00:23:50,407
Also when he's at group therapy

512
00:23:50,474 --> 00:23:52,441
or out for dinner with friends.

513
00:23:52,668 --> 00:23:56,524
当她没注意向Mark提到 你来过...?
And when she happens to mention to Mark

514
00:23:54,508 --> 00:23:57,040
that you dropped by...

515
00:23:56,591 --> 00:23:58,585
你把什么都告诉你老婆?
You tell your wife everything?

516
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:03,259
这是个...过程
It's a...process.

517
00:24:04,602 --> 00:24:08,280
但是Stacy没有什么理由向Mark隐瞒这个
But Stacy doesn't have any reason

518
00:24:06,474 --> 00:24:08,541
to hide this from Mark.

519
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:11,368
据她现在所知 Mark对你的出现还算可以忍受
As far as she knows,

520
00:24:11,452 --> 00:24:14,029
我打赌她尽可能不向Mark提到我
Mark's okay with you being there.

521
00:24:11,307 --> 00:24:12,807
My bet is she mentions me to Mark

522
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:17,611
因为她认为Mark认为她对我还有感觉
as little as possible.

523
00:24:14,574 --> 00:24:16,174
She thinks that he thinks that she still

524
00:24:17,695 --> 00:24:19,624
你知道她为什么这么想吗?
has feelings for me.

525
00:24:18,007 --> 00:24:20,207
And you know why she thinks that?

526
00:24:20,047 --> 00:24:22,836
因为她对你还有感觉?
Because she still has feelings for you?

527
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,523
如果你说的没错 她确实告诉他了 我想今晚我就会进不去门
If you're right, she did tell him,

528
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,174
and I don't get through the door tonight.

529
00:24:27,661 --> 00:24:29,454
如果我说对了...
If I'm right...

530
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:41,294
我们要在这里呆多长时间?
So how long do we stay here?

531
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,398
直到有什么事发生
Until something happens.

532
00:24:44,665 --> 00:24:47,112
他不会出来陪我们了
He's not gonna come out with us right here.

533
00:24:48,682 --> 00:24:53,078
我们在下风处 而他看上去有点听力衰弱
We are downwind, and he seems to have

534
00:24:51,474 --> 00:24:53,241
a hearing loss.

535
00:24:53,162 --> 00:24:55,302
他又不瞎
He's not blind.

536
00:24:55,302 --> 00:24:58,818
Steve McQueen不会逃避危险
Steve McQueen does not run from danger.

537
00:25:01,073 --> 00:25:04,209
抗生素 从另一方面讲...
Antibiotics, on the other hand...

538
00:25:04,412 --> 00:25:08,289
他在咬药片周围? 真聪明!
He ate around the pill?

539
00:25:08,388 --> 00:25:11,256
承认吧 你喜欢他
Smart.

540
00:25:08,274 --> 00:25:10,974
Admit it, you like him.

541
00:25:11,628 --> 00:25:14,603
他很好...作为一个老鼠来说
He's all right. For a rat.

542
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,750
你想知道他有多酷吗?
You wanna know how cool he is?

543
00:25:17,945 --> 00:25:23,826
他的尿液显示身体内有氰化氢 甲醛 铅
His urine showed traces of hydrogen cyanide,

544
00:25:21,174 --> 00:25:24,207
formaldehyde, lead.

545
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,477
他抽烟
He's a smoker.

546
00:25:28,323 --> 00:25:30,580
你老公开始抽烟...
Your husband's been lighting up.

547
00:25:31,068 --> 00:25:34,557
很愚蠢的想法 会导致他的AIP...
Which is particularly stupid, given that it could

548
00:25:34,641 --> 00:25:38,743
好了 我把我的烟灰倒通风孔里了 Mark就不会知道了
'cause his AIP to--

549
00:25:35,174 --> 00:25:36,773
Okay, I blow my smoke into the vent

550
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,241
so Mark doesn't know.

551
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,617
我一直知道
I always knew.

552
00:25:41,724 --> 00:25:42,999
吹牛!
You're bluffing.

553
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:47,772
我手术后两个星期你开始的
You started two weeks after my surgery.

554
00:25:47,988 --> 00:25:50,366
先是薄荷醇 一个月后开始抽烟了
Menthols...

555
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,214
你当时怎么不说啊?
then lights after a month.

556
00:25:50,574 --> 00:25:52,074
Why didn't you say anything?

557
00:25:52,298 --> 00:25:55,145
因为它可以帮助我监控你的痛苦水平
'Cause it helped me monitor your misery level.

558
00:25:57,001 --> 00:26:01,831
一天一次很舒服 多于六次 你就是在地狱里了
One trip outside was a good day.

559
00:25:58,274 --> 00:26:02,574
Upwards of six, you were in hell.

560
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:06,045
你应该问我过怎么样的!
You could have asked me how I was.

561
00:26:06,007 --> 00:26:10,474
I already knew.

562
00:26:07,758 --> 00:26:10,251
我已经知道了

563
00:26:10,541 --> 00:26:14,174
I'm sorry you were miserable.

564
00:26:12,125 --> 00:26:14,385
抱歉让你很痛苦

565
00:26:17,403 --> 00:26:20,496
抱歉让你这么痛苦
Sorry I caused you so much pain.

566
00:26:33,323 --> 00:26:35,025
啊哈

567
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:43,984
很高兴你改主意了
Thought you'd change your mind about that drink.

568
00:26:44,068 --> 00:26:45,448
请进
Come on in.

569
00:26:46,253 --> 00:26:49,440
你应该有改变的 校园里有个新地方...
You should get changed.

570
00:26:47,574 --> 00:26:51,074
There's this new place on campus that looks--

571
00:26:58,126 --> 00:27:00,822
- 你很high? - 嗯
Are you high?

572
00:27:03,484 --> 00:27:06,024
我以为你把药都扔掉了
I thought the lab disposed of the drugs.

573
00:27:06,128 --> 00:27:07,780
不是全部
Not all of it.

574
00:27:10,592 --> 00:27:13,574
呃 等等...
Uh, slow down.

575
00:27:14,025 --> 00:27:16,092
你的瞳孔在扩大!
Your pupils are dilated. You're not...

576
00:27:16,406 --> 00:27:19,503
好了 Chase 别把我变成那个好孩子
Come on, Chase, don't turn into

577
00:27:17,673 --> 00:27:18,574
a good guy on me now.

578
00:27:52,478 --> 00:27:56,738
你迟到了 而且宿醉
You're late.

579
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,107
And hung over.

580
00:27:58,502 --> 00:28:00,262
也许不是
Or maybe not.

581
00:28:00,992 --> 00:28:02,980
你干嘛拿着一只老鼠?
Why do you have a rat?

582
00:28:03,502 --> 00:28:06,460
嫉妒吗?
Jealous?

583
00:28:09,425 --> 00:28:13,941
出去! 你怎么能这么对我!
<i>(Kalvin)</i> <i>Out of my room!</i>

584
00:28:11,707 --> 00:28:14,740
<i>(Michael)</i> <i>Don't you dare</i> <i>put this on me!</i>

585
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:16,100
我不会求你的 爸爸!
<i>(Kalvin)</i> <i>I'm not gonna grovel, Dad.</i>

586
00:28:16,184 --> 00:28:17,721
我要的不是这个的
That's not what I'm asking for.

587
00:28:17,805 --> 00:28:20,356
谁他妈信! 你说过没有打电话!
<i>(Kalvin)</i> <i>Like hell it isn't.</i>

588
00:28:18,673 --> 00:28:19,640
You said you didn't call.

589
00:28:22,926 --> 00:28:25,046
不用管我 我是来看戏的
Don't mind me.

590
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:27,721
随便 这里没什么好看的
Just here for the show.

591
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,940
Well, there's not gonna be any.

592
00:28:28,287 --> 00:28:32,378
伟大的道歉怎么没了? 昨天 他还说 "爸爸 对不起"
What happened to the big apology?

593
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:30,807
<i>Yesterday, he was all,</i>

594
00:28:30,874 --> 00:28:32,341
"Daddy, I'm so sowwy."

595
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:33,650
这不关你的事
This is none of your business.

596
00:28:33,734 --> 00:28:36,193
你跟踪我之前就应该想到的
You should have thought of that

597
00:28:34,707 --> 00:28:36,374
before you stalked me.

598
00:28:36,413 --> 00:28:37,670
现在我忽然有兴趣了
Now I'm interested.

599
00:28:37,754 --> 00:28:40,751
他要为什么道歉? 是你把他踢出家门的
So what's he got to apologize for?

600
00:28:40,835 --> 00:28:41,904
我为什么要那样做?
You're the one who tossed him out.

601
00:28:41,988 --> 00:28:44,800
不知道 因为你很难向你的打猎的伙伴们吹嘘
Now, why would I do that?

602
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,407
I don't know,

603
00:28:44,885 --> 00:28:46,654
说你的儿子没完没了的咳嗽
'cause it's tough to brag to your hunting buddies

604
00:28:45,074 --> 00:28:46,474
that your son knows all the words to <i>The Wiz.</i>

605
00:28:46,738 --> 00:28:47,418
假话!
That's a lie.

606
00:28:47,502 --> 00:28:49,287
42街?
<i>42nd Street.</i>

607
00:28:49,356 --> 00:28:53,105
喝多了然后打他 太容易了 可以解释他为什么恨你
<i>Much easier just to</i> <i>get drunk and beat him.</i>

608
00:28:53,205 --> 00:28:54,922
也可以解释你的肝硬化
<i>Explains his hating you.</i>

609
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:58,589
也可以解释为什么我说的越多 你出汗越多
Also your cirrhosis.

610
00:28:55,307 --> 00:28:58,940
Also why the more I talk, the more you sweat.

611
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:03,259
它不能解释的是... 为什么他要向你道歉
What it doesn't explain...

612
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:04,508
is why he's gotta apologize to you.

613
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:08,029
你对自己的同性恋行为 还有点愧疚之心?
Residual guilt for sharing

614
00:29:06,107 --> 00:29:07,974
your special toy with other boys?

615
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:10,152
不要胡说
Just leave it alone.

616
00:29:10,236 --> 00:29:12,528
还是说你想这个老顽固在你死后内心能平静一点?
You just wanna leave the bigot

617
00:29:12,612 --> 00:29:16,358
听着 这个事和他搞同性恋没有一丁点的关系!
with some peace of mind after you're gone?

618
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,840
Look, this has got nothing, and I mean nothing,

619
00:29:14,907 --> 00:29:16,007
to do with him being gay.

620
00:29:16,442 --> 00:29:19,996
Kal他自作自受 还害了他妈妈!
Kal brought this on himself

621
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,508
with what he did to his mother.

622
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,706
他偷了她用来炫耀的衣服?
He steal her signature look?

623
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:25,365
不是 他杀了她
No

624
00:29:22,907 --> 00:29:24,874
??

625
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:32,810
Kalvin在撒谎!
Kalvin lied.

626
00:29:32,915 --> 00:29:35,360
对 当然让人震惊
Yeah, that certainly is shocking.

627
00:29:36,497 --> 00:29:40,856
妈妈的肾脏衰竭了 她需要移植一个 他们检查了Kalvin 配型成功
<i>Mom's kidneys</i> <i>were failing,</i>

628
00:29:38,241 --> 00:29:39,807
she needed a transplant.

629
00:29:40,968 --> 00:29:45,781
他同时也是HIV阳性 妈妈再也没找到合适的捐赠人 她死了
<i>They tested Kalvin,</i> <i>he was a match.</i>

630
00:29:42,174 --> 00:29:43,441
He was also positive for HIV.

631
00:29:43,507 --> 00:29:45,207
Mom never found a qualified donor.

632
00:29:45,274 --> 00:29:47,974
She dies.

633
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:48,909
悲剧
<i>(House)</i> <i>Tragic tale.</i>

634
00:29:49,097 --> 00:29:52,790
穿这么紧身 说话速度这么快 不停地来回移动
Undercut slightly by the rapid-fire delivery

635
00:29:52,881 --> 00:29:54,502
今天早晨咖啡喝多了?
and constant movement.

636
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:57,768
他没有杀她 我们身体并不是给父母提供器官的农场
<i>Too much coffee</i> <i>this morning?</i>

637
00:29:54,974 --> 00:29:56,474
He didn't kill her.

638
00:29:57,852 --> 00:30:01,123
这不是80年代 我们都知道HIV是怎么传染的!
Our bodies aren't donor farms for our parents.

639
00:29:57,974 --> 00:29:59,474
It's not 1980.

640
00:29:59,541 --> 00:30:01,907
<i>We know how</i> <i>HIV is transmitted.</i>

641
00:30:01,207 --> 00:30:05,293
如果Kalvin因为无保护性交 导致感染HIV 爸爸有理由发怒!
If Kalvin got HIV through unprotected sex,

642
00:30:05,377 --> 00:30:06,796
你一直用安全套吗?
Dad has every right to be pissed.

643
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,151
呃... 当然!
So you always use a condom?

644
00:30:08,296 --> 00:30:10,071
社会下层的兄弟 没办法
Uh, yeah.

645
00:30:10,155 --> 00:30:12,216
嗯 还没准备好要个小Foreman
Brothers on the down-low got to.

646
00:30:12,324 --> 00:30:12,843
你?
Not ready for any Foreman Juniors yet.

647
00:30:12,927 --> 00:30:15,091
工作的女孩都很顽固
You?

648
00:30:13,807 --> 00:30:15,740
Working girls are sticklers.

649
00:30:16,473 --> 00:30:18,360
你不准备找Chase的碴?
You're not gonna poll Chase?

650
00:30:20,609 --> 00:30:22,229
我不是白痴
I'm not an idiot.

651
00:30:22,567 --> 00:30:24,108
你当然不是
Obviously not.

652
00:30:24,193 --> 00:30:27,621
如果有机会 谁不会去和一个 吃了药的同事睡觉?
Who doesn't sleep with a drugged-out colleague

653
00:30:26,807 --> 00:30:28,873
when they have a chance?

654
00:30:33,228 --> 00:30:34,718
Wilson在哪里?
Where's Wilson?

655
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,448
我们有了病人Kveim检查的结果
We got the results of the Kveim test.

656
00:30:44,684 --> 00:30:49,483
所以... 我得了癌症?
So, I have cancer?

657
00:30:50,122 --> 00:30:53,034
最大的可能性 是的
In all likelihood, yeah.

658
00:30:53,615 --> 00:30:55,900
非霍奇金淋巴瘤
Non-Hodgkins lymphoma.

659
00:30:57,552 --> 00:31:01,815
所以我...要死了?
And I am...dying.

660
00:31:05,957 --> 00:31:09,818
我们需要肿瘤的活体进行检验 它在你的主动脉附近 所以...
We need to biopsy the tumor.

661
00:31:09,954 --> 00:31:12,315
做这个活体取样危险性非常大
It's near your aorta, so getting that sample

662
00:31:12,315 --> 00:31:14,364
我爸爸还在这里吗?
<i>carries serious risks.</i>

663
00:31:13,374 --> 00:31:14,807
Is my dad still here?

664
00:31:15,663 --> 00:31:17,503
他没进来?
He hasn't been in?

665
00:31:22,081 --> 00:31:26,230
我们会把你心脏附近的组织染色 让肿瘤在CT上显形
We'll inject the dye

666
00:31:23,807 --> 00:31:25,807
<i>around your heart</i> <i>to make the tumor visible</i>

667
00:31:26,315 --> 00:31:30,389
然后会做一个小手术 植入一根引线通到心脏中
<i>on the CT.</i>

668
00:31:27,574 --> 00:31:29,740
<i>Then a surgeon</i> <i>inserts a guidewire,</i>

669
00:31:30,473 --> 00:31:34,956
然后截取一点肿瘤的组织 以便我们用显微镜观察
<i>runs it up</i> <i>into your heart,</i>

670
00:31:31,274 --> 00:31:33,207
<i>where he takes a small piece</i> <i>of that tumor</i>

671
00:31:33,274 --> 00:31:36,708
<i>so we can look at it</i> <i>under the microscope.</i>

672
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:39,505
阿提凡 帮你镇定一下 (镇静剂 不是阿凡提)
Atavan.

673
00:31:39,589 --> 00:31:41,324
你怎么这么镇定?
It'll help settle you down.

674
00:31:41,408 --> 00:31:43,581
药效还没过去呢
Why are you so calm?

675
00:31:41,807 --> 00:31:46,608
Not coming off meth helps.

676
00:31:45,866 --> 00:31:48,448
昨晚的事也许不该再发生了
Last night probably shouldn't happen again.

677
00:31:48,591 --> 00:31:50,508
你以为我想吗?
Do you think I want it to?

678
00:31:51,458 --> 00:31:54,187
两个人发生了关系 除非情况很糟糕
When two people have had sex,

679
00:31:54,272 --> 00:31:56,893
如果他们能再做 他们还会再做
unless it sucks,

680
00:31:55,241 --> 00:31:57,574
if they can do it again, they're gonna do it again.

681
00:31:56,977 --> 00:31:59,542
然后事情就复杂了
And that's when things get complicated.

682
00:32:00,967 --> 00:32:03,048
昨晚还算不错
And it didn't suck.

683
00:32:07,602 --> 00:32:11,964
你现在又找了个借口 去找你的老情人叙旧
So now you've gotta drum up another excuse

684
00:32:10,708 --> 00:32:12,674
to be around the love of your life.

685
00:32:12,524 --> 00:32:14,318
再打一个病人
Could hit another patient.

686
00:32:14,402 --> 00:32:17,743
不是 不想重复自己 人们会认为我很刻板
Nah, don't like to repeat myself.

687
00:32:17,827 --> 00:32:20,301
看样子你不会再让老鼠跑掉 然后你再抓回来了
People will say I'm formulaic.

688
00:32:18,608 --> 00:32:20,007
Well that rules out letting the rat go

689
00:32:20,385 --> 00:32:21,463
我不能那样做
so you can catch him again.

690
00:32:21,464 --> 00:32:24,330
Steve 需要两个星期的抗生素 和一个无烟的环境
I can't do that.

691
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:23,940
Steve needs two weeks antibiotics

692
00:32:24,414 --> 00:32:26,536
烟草会加剧他的感染
and a smoke free environment.

693
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,655
老鼠真的病了?
Cigarettes aggravated his infection.

694
00:32:28,797 --> 00:32:30,325
那个东西会传染整个医院的!
The rat is actually sick?

695
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:33,493
Steve的感染不会传染人类
That thing could infect the entire hospital.

696
00:32:31,374 --> 00:32:34,541
Steve's infection is not contagious to humans.

697
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:37,155
我是个白痴 我怎么忘了支原体感染? 那个是病人的父亲?
I'm an idiot. How do I miss mycoplasmosis?

698
00:32:37,267 --> 00:32:40,344
对 你记得黑死病吗? 就是从老鼠开始的
Was that the kid's father?

699
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,974
Yeah.

700
00:32:40,428 --> 00:32:42,811
他在走廊里干什么? 那个孩子的活检准备好了吗?
Remember the black death? Started with rats.

701
00:32:40,974 --> 00:32:42,407
Well, what's he doing in the hallway?

702
00:32:42,895 --> 00:32:43,958
他只是不想进病房
Is the kid getting his biopsy already?

703
00:32:44,101 --> 00:32:46,824
谁知道还有没有什么别的原因? 寄生虫? 细菌感染?
He just won't go in the room.

704
00:32:45,107 --> 00:32:46,174
Who knows what else he has.

705
00:32:46,929 --> 00:32:49,898
- 这孩子没有寄生虫 - 不是孩子 是老鼠
Parasites, bacterial infection?

706
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,040
The kid doesn't have parasites.

707
00:32:50,531 --> 00:32:51,947
他还出汗吗?
Not the kid, the rat.

708
00:32:50,341 --> 00:32:52,507
Was he still sweating?

709
00:32:52,133 --> 00:32:54,311
老鼠只能通过尾巴流汗
Rats only sweat through their tails.

710
00:32:54,395 --> 00:32:56,270
不是老鼠 是爸爸!
Not the rat, the dad.

711
00:32:58,870 --> 00:32:59,996
他们从哪儿来的?
Where are they from?

712
00:33:00,077 --> 00:33:02,573
呃...蒙大拿 怎么了? (蒙大拿 美国打猎胜地)
Uh, Montana. What's going on?

713
00:33:02,657 --> 00:33:04,276
你是对的 就是寄生虫
You were right, it's a parasite.

714
00:33:04,361 --> 00:33:06,760
取消活检 会杀了他的
Cancel the biopsy, it'll kill him.

715
00:33:08,015 --> 00:33:09,785
嘿 老爹 跟我来!
Hey, daddy, come with me.

716
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,389
好 啊... 我不去那里
Yeah, uh, I'm not going in there.

717
00:33:16,552 --> 00:33:18,671
你儿子要和你说话
Your son asked to talk to you.

718
00:33:21,897 --> 00:33:23,632
他来这里干什么?
Why is he here?

719
00:33:26,161 --> 00:33:27,514
他想和你说话
He wanted to talk to you.

720
00:33:27,584 --> 00:33:28,666
啊哈
Oh.

721
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:31,143
你们两个曾经一起打猎?
Did you two used to hunt together?

722
00:33:31,498 --> 00:33:33,274
狐狸 你们杀过狐狸吗?
Foxes. Did you kill foxes?

723
00:33:33,358 --> 00:33:34,973
蒙大拿州啊
It's Montana.

724
00:33:36,061 --> 00:33:38,808
你胸部的组织不是肿瘤
Those masses in your chest are not tumors.

725
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:42,421
他们是寄生虫囊肿 这个虫子叫棘球绦虫
They're parasitic cysts from a bug called

726
00:33:42,506 --> 00:33:46,116
你们碰过死狐狸 它们登陆你们的身体 它们可以潜伏几十年
echinococcosis.

727
00:33:43,207 --> 00:33:44,840
Touch a dead fox, they jump aboard,

728
00:33:46,258 --> 00:33:49,264
- 生长 繁殖 购物 化装演出
they can hunker down for decades.

729
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,773
Growing, spawning, shopping.

730
00:33:49,348 --> 00:33:51,860
我查过寄生虫了
Putting on plays.

731
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,040
I've been tested for parasites.

732
00:33:52,136 --> 00:33:55,005
好吧 是癌症 高兴了?
Okay, it's cancer.

733
00:33:55,306 --> 00:33:57,589
囊肿隔离了寄生虫
You happy?

734
00:33:55,441 --> 00:33:59,007
The cysts isolate the parasites.

735
00:33:57,673 --> 00:34:00,768
粪便检验的时候就查不来 甚至血检 心脏...
Keep them from showing up in stool samples.

736
00:34:00,852 --> 00:34:02,542
好了 你根本不需要我
Even a blood test, cardiac--

737
00:34:02,626 --> 00:34:04,666
但你的肝里也有同样的东西
All right, you don't need me for this.

738
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:04,740
But you've got the same things in your liver.

739
00:34:07,323 --> 00:34:08,905
我有肝硬化
I have cirrhosis.

740
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:13,122
肝脏囊肿的症状和它一样 不过还多一个 发烧
Liver cysts have identical symptoms.

741
00:34:13,206 --> 00:34:15,134
肝脏囊肿我们可以查出来的
With one addition, fever.

742
00:34:13,608 --> 00:34:15,608
<i>And liver cysts</i> <i>we can test for.</i>

743
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,260
你的诊断结果可以确诊Kalvin的
Your diagnosis could confirm Kalvin's.

744
00:34:19,022 --> 00:34:20,939
那么 选项A 我们抽点血...
So, option A-- we draw some blood--

745
00:34:21,023 --> 00:34:22,792
不 不 听着 不要碰我
No, no, look, you're not touching me.

746
00:34:22,876 --> 00:34:24,461
看到没 这就是为什么我找你来
See, this is why I need you here.

747
00:34:24,569 --> 00:34:30,149
我想让你告诉你儿子 你不想做个简单而无痛的血检来救他的命
I want you to tell your son

748
00:34:26,708 --> 00:34:28,241
that you won't take a simple

749
00:34:28,307 --> 00:34:30,140
painless blood test to save his life.

750
00:34:44,369 --> 00:34:51,100
你从来没有对你妈妈的事表示过一点遗憾
You never expressed a shred of regret

751
00:34:51,226 --> 00:34:52,189
天哪 爸爸...
for what happened to your mother.

752
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:54,838
如果你带了那该死的安全套 你就会没事
Jeez, Dad.

753
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,241
<i>If you'd have worn</i> <i>a damn rubber,</i>

754
00:34:54,922 --> 00:34:59,021
你就能救她的命 你就不会躺在这里!
<i>you'd have been fine.</i>

755
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,574
<i>You could have</i> <i>saved her life.</i>

756
00:34:57,641 --> 00:34:58,873
<i>You wouldn't be lying here.</i>

757
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:02,257
好好 好好 我知道了!
<i>(House)</i> <i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,</i> <i>I get it.</i>

758
00:35:02,406 --> 00:35:05,791
他在毁灭自己也在毁灭你爱的东西 你对此非常非常生气
You're really mad at him for killing himself

759
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:08,353
我没有时间搞这个 你要道歉吗?
and for destroying everything you love.

760
00:35:06,474 --> 00:35:07,641
<i>I don't have time for this.</i>

761
00:35:08,462 --> 00:35:10,413
我在用我想的方式生活
Are you gonna apologize?

762
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:11,765
你给我点血吗?
I'm living my life the way I want.

763
00:35:11,849 --> 00:35:14,368
如果他不在乎 我也不!
Are you gonna give me some blood?

764
00:35:12,541 --> 00:35:13,674
Look, if he doesn't give a damn,

765
00:35:14,452 --> 00:35:16,510
好 B选项
then neither do I.

766
00:35:14,641 --> 00:35:17,474
Okay, option B.

767
00:35:16,827 --> 00:35:19,215
为什么你的妻子要自杀? 她恨你吗?
Why did your wife kill herself?

768
00:35:19,299 --> 00:35:21,154
她有糖尿病!
<i>Did she hate you?</i>

769
00:35:21,238 --> 00:35:23,351
你一点也不了解我的Susan
She was a diabetic.

770
00:35:23,435 --> 00:35:27,386
要么Susan想死 要么她又肥又蠢
You know, you don't know a thing about my Susan.

771
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,274
Either Susan wanted to die,

772
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,016
吃高糖饼干来代替枪
or she was both fat and stupid.

773
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,164
能吃的女人 她们永远没有吃饱的时候!
<i>Used a Twinkie</i> <i>instead of a gun.</i>

774
00:35:29,507 --> 00:35:30,740
And girls with big appetites,

775
00:35:32,256 --> 00:35:32,669
闭嘴!
well, they just can't get enough of anything.

776
00:35:32,753 --> 00:35:34,679
也许尝过这个国家的每种饼干!
Shut up.

777
00:35:34,763 --> 00:35:35,305
闭嘴!
Probably nibbled on every Devil Dog in the county.

778
00:35:35,389 --> 00:35:38,004
如果我没说清楚 我不是说那些美味的小吃...
Shut up! Jeez, I'm not making myself clear.

779
00:35:38,084 --> 00:35:40,303
你这个婊子养的!
I don't mean the delicious snack.

780
00:35:39,074 --> 00:35:41,341
You son of a bitch!

781
00:35:41,805 --> 00:35:43,793
啊? 来啊!
Yeah?

782
00:35:44,671 --> 00:35:46,974
谢谢你 这代表我可以这样做了
<i>Come on!</i>

783
00:35:45,507 --> 00:35:47,507
Thank you. That means I can do this.

784
00:35:48,789 --> 00:35:50,594
我们需要些肾上腺素 快!
We're gonna need some epi in here, stat!

785
00:35:50,678 --> 00:35:52,024
你疯了吗?!
Are you out of your mind?

786
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,337
你说了你不介意
You said you didn't care.

787
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,306
注意到没有你是为什么不能呼吸的?
Notice how you can't breathe?

788
00:35:57,844 --> 00:35:59,185
要么是我的拐杖
Now either that's the cane,

789
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:02,047
要么就是我刚弄破了一个我们刚刚在讨论的包囊
or I just ruptured one of those liver cysts

790
00:36:02,121 --> 00:36:03,733
你正在经历过敏性休克
we were chatting about.

791
00:36:03,817 --> 00:36:07,771
和你儿子意外撞到我朋友的车后 的症状一模一样
And you've gone into anaphylactic shock.

792
00:36:04,474 --> 00:36:06,807
<i>Exactly the same when your son</i> <i>did when he accidentally</i>

793
00:36:07,882 --> 00:36:10,061
我太兴奋了 没有判断能力了!
tripped against my friend's car.

794
00:36:08,441 --> 00:36:10,407
I['m just so excited to find out which.

795
00:36:17,312 --> 00:36:19,121
我去安排手术
I'll go schedule the surgery.

796
00:36:23,545 --> 00:36:24,664
夹子
Clamp.

797
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,356
血压稳定
Pressure's holding.

798
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:13,973
两个成功的手术 两条人命
Two successful surgeries, two lives saved.

799
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:17,356
超出定量了 下个星期能不能放我假?
I'm over my quota.

800
00:37:16,241 --> 00:37:17,740
Can I have next week off?

801
00:37:18,398 --> 00:37:20,629
攻击两个家庭成员
Two family members assaulted.

802
00:37:20,772 --> 00:37:23,433
- 正当防卫 - 你引诱他下手
[scoffs] It was self-defense.

803
00:37:23,583 --> 00:37:25,625
你说的对 我活该
You baited him.

804
00:37:24,107 --> 00:37:26,241
You're right, I was asking for it.

805
00:37:25,813 --> 00:37:28,547
低胸衬衫 写着“干我”之类的胸部
The low-cut blouse, the "do-me" pumps.

806
00:37:28,816 --> 00:37:31,871
你利用寄生虫让他的内脏出血 他可以起诉你
You flooded his gut with a parasite, he could sue.

807
00:37:33,716 --> 00:37:35,476
去见Stacy
Go see Stacy.

808
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:38,178
好
Okay.

809
00:37:38,774 --> 00:37:44,996
什么? 好? 没有骂人? 没有诉苦? 没有撕衣服?
That's it? "Okay"?

810
00:37:41,441 --> 00:37:42,708
No name-calling, no squawking,

811
00:37:42,773 --> 00:37:44,541
no rending of garments?

812
00:37:45,438 --> 00:37:47,286
我喜欢这件T恤
I like this T-shirt.

813
00:37:52,582 --> 00:37:54,076
你骗我
You lied to me.

814
00:37:55,096 --> 00:37:56,711
如果这和我妈妈相关...
If this is about my mom--

815
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:59,359
这和你孤独悲惨的生活有关
This is about your lonely, miserable life.

816
00:37:59,483 --> 00:38:01,275
我不悲惨
I'm not miserable.

817
00:38:01,578 --> 00:38:05,592
不论哪里 只要有同性恋酒吧 我就不孤独
And as long as there's a gay bar around, I'm never lonely.

818
00:38:05,947 --> 00:38:08,547
除了你爸爸 都没人来看你
You haven't had a single visitor except for your dad.

毒品很伟大 HIV给了你自由

你爸爸恨你 你这么高兴
Your dad hates you. You're so happy.

821

全都是谎言!
Everything's a lie.

822
00:38:15,027 --> 00:38:17,272
你因为妈妈的死责怪自己
You blame yourself for your mom's death.

823
00:38:17,357 --> 00:38:20,017
你不是在自娱自乐 你是在毁灭自己
You're not trying to have fun, you're trying to self-destruct.

824
00:38:20,101 --> 00:38:23,585
你想自杀吗? 好 但是干脆一点!
You wanna kill yourself? Fine.

825
00:38:22,441 --> 00:38:23,773
But stop recruiting.

826
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,926
听说你又打了一个病人
Heard you hit another patient.

827
00:38:35,336 --> 00:38:38,684
嗯 对 为什么不呢?
[scoffs] Yeah, sure. Why not?

828
00:38:39,324 --> 00:38:40,807
他先打我
He hit me first.

829
00:38:40,891 --> 00:38:43,959
Cuddy没有和我提到这个 让我看看
Cuddy didn't mention that. Let me see.

830
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:49,708
I'm the doctor.

831
00:38:47,935 --> 00:38:49,100
我是医生

832
00:38:49,209 --> 00:38:51,285
我是纯粹出于法律上的关心
My concern is purely legal. Looks okay.

833
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:54,763
看着没事 疼吗?

834
00:38:55,017 --> 00:38:56,103
一点
A little.

835
00:38:57,458 --> 00:38:59,155
需要冷敷一下
You need some ice.

836
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,492
Mark不可能不知道...
There's no way that Mark doesn't know.

837
00:39:09,511 --> 00:39:11,231
你抽烟的事
About the smoking.

838
00:39:11,936 --> 00:39:13,698
他应该说点什么的
He would have said something.

839
00:39:16,763 --> 00:39:19,323
看来他已经好几个月没碰你了
Then he hasn't been near you in months.

840
00:39:19,873 --> 00:39:23,873
We're fine.

841
00:39:21,499 --> 00:39:23,294
我们很好

842
00:39:26,017 --> 00:39:27,692
没这么简单
Can't be easy.

843
00:39:27,776 --> 00:39:29,434
别乱动
Stop squirming.

844
00:39:37,463 --> 00:39:39,364
你为什么要撒谎?
Why would you lie about this?

845
00:39:39,547 --> 00:39:41,072
我没在撒谎
I'm not lying.

846
00:39:42,837 --> 00:39:45,522
我并不在意你是不是在和他睡觉 但如果你没有 那么...
I don't care if you're sleeping with him or not,

847
00:39:45,582 --> 00:39:46,618
我有
but you're not, so--

848
00:39:46,702 --> 00:39:48,424
你在说谎
I am.

849
00:39:47,507 --> 00:39:48,674
You're lying.

850
00:39:49,495 --> 00:39:52,964
你知道我什么时候做爱? 你连这个也能闻出来?
You know when I have sex?

851
00:39:50,907 --> 00:39:52,708
You can smell that on me too?

852
00:39:54,423 --> 00:39:57,767
唯一能知道我和Mark之间的事的人 就是我和Mark
The only people that know about

853
00:39:56,207 --> 00:39:57,507
what's going on with me and Mark,

我也了解你
And I know you.

857
00:40:08,186 --> 00:40:13,179
你自信 你傲慢 但是你从来不确定除非有个理由能让你确认
<i>You're confident,</i> <i>arrogant,</i>

858
00:40:10,407 --> 00:40:11,740
<i>but you are never certain</i>

859
00:40:11,807 --> 00:40:13,341
<i>unless there's</i> <i>a reason to be certain.</i>

860
00:40:13,696 --> 00:40:17,011
还有一个人知道 我告诉你了我在看Harper医生
One other person knew.

861
00:40:15,474 --> 00:40:17,674
I told you I was seeing Dr. Harper.

862
00:40:17,095 --> 00:40:20,996
你可以很简单的进入她的办公室 你读了我的档案
You can easily get into her office.

863
00:40:19,341 --> 00:40:21,740

00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:33,082
你读了我的档案?
You read my file.

865
00:40:34,469 --> 00:40:38,489
那些盘子 关心 哦...
<i>The dishes,</i>

866
00:40:36,407 --> 00:40:41,274
the concern, the, oh, acting like a human being.

867
00:40:38,634 --> 00:40:40,651
装得像个人?

868
00:40:40,736 --> 00:40:42,136
你...
You have--

869
00:40:45,316 --> 00:40:47,485
一直在欺骗我?
This whole time, you've been manipulating me.

870
00:40:47,588 --> 00:40:52,759
从我把洗洁精倒刷子上时你就知道我在使坏
You knew that I had an angle the moment I--

871
00:40:50,873 --> 00:40:53,807
poured soap onto a scrub brush.

872
00:40:53,977 --> 00:40:55,724
你应该把我扔出去的
You could've thrown me out.

873
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:58,106
或者忽略我 或者再找一个灭鼠公司
Or ignored me, or found another exterminator.

874
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:00,348
但是你没有告诉Mark我经常来
But you didn't even tell Mark that I kept coming by.

875
00:41:00,432 --> 00:41:03,282
你让这些事发生 因为你想和我一起
You let this happen because you wanna be with me.

876
00:41:06,233 --> 00:41:08,461
不再需要了
I don't anymore.

877
00:41:10,571 --> 00:41:12,090
滚
Get out.
