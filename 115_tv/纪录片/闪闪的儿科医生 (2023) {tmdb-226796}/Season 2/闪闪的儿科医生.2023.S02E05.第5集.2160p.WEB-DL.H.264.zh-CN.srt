00:00:20,644 --> 00:00:21,344
Yeah. 可以走了吗?

13
00:00:21,444 --> 00:00:22,144
我没撒谎.
- Had I known you were pregnant... - You broke off with me.

14
00:00:22,244 --> 00:00:23,644
你一直隐藏着真相 我如何能知道你

15
00:00:23,744 --> 00:00:26,244
我清楚的记得是你先提出和我分手的.

16
00:00:26,544 --> 00:00:27,044
Yang医生.
- Dr. Yang! - Cristina!

17
00:00:27,144 --> 00:00:27,544
Cristina
[Addison] It's an extrauterine pregnancy. She's bleeding out.

18
00:00:27,744 --> 00:00:29,744
她是宫外孕 而且大出血

19
00:00:30,444 --> 00:00:31,644
我认为我不该在这里.
- [Ellis] I'm not supposed to be here. - [Richard] No, you're not.

20
00:00:32,044 --> 00:00:33,344
不，你不该.
I don't want someone who doesn't want me,

21
00:00:33,444 --> 00:00:35,644
我不想要一个不要我的人, Meredith,

22
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:39,044
但是如果有万分之一的机会他可能会要我 我不会离开西雅图的.
but if there's the slightest chance that he does, I'm not leaving Seattle.

23
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:46,444
疼痛来自于所有不同的形式...
<i>[Meredith] Pain comes in all forms.</i>

24

我过的很愉快，真的.
I had a good time. Really. Thank you.

25
00:00:49,044 --> 00:00:51,244
谢谢，真是一个美好的夜晚.
It was the perfect evening. Best date ever.

26
00:00:51,344 --> 00:00:53,444
从没有过的约会，从未.
- Whatever. - Izzie.

27
00:00:53,544 --> 00:00:54,044
Izzie.
I especially liked the part where you treated me like crap the entire night.

28
00:00:54,144 --> 00:00:58,244
还有，我最喜欢的部分就是 整个晚上你对待我就像对待废物一样.

29
00:00:58,344 --> 00:00:58,744
真有意思.
- That was fun. - I had a good time.

30
00:00:58,844 --> 00:00:59,644
我过的很愉快.

31
00:01:00,544 --> 00:01:01,244
真的?
- Really? - Yeah.

32
00:01:01,544 --> 00:01:01,944
Yeah.
<i>The small twinge, a bit of soreness,</i> <i>the random pain.</i>

33
00:01:02,744 --> 00:01:06,344
阵痛，轻微疼痛，没有规律的痛,

34
00:01:06,944 --> 00:01:09,744
正常的疼痛每天都伴随着我们...
<i>The normal pains we live with every day.</i>

35
00:01:09,844 --> 00:01:10,744
我该走了.
I gotta go.

36
00:01:14,244 --> 00:01:15,344
你认真的?
Seriously?

37
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:17,944
真的吗?
Seriously?

38
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:20,544
有一种疼痛你无法忽视.
<i>Then there's the kind of pain</i> <i>we can't ignore.</i>

39
00:01:20,744 --> 00:01:21,844
真的吗?
Seriously?

40
00:01:22,144 --> 00:01:26,244
一级疼痛真是太棒了. 它能阻挡任何其他的事情..
<i>A level of pain so great</i> <i>that it blocks out everything else.</i>

41
00:01:26,344 --> 00:01:27,544
oh,我都睡着了.
- [George] I'm sleeping. - Oh, shut it.

42
00:01:28,144 --> 00:01:28,444
Oh, 给我闭嘴.
Shut...

43
00:01:30,744 --> 00:01:33,044
让世界的其他部分逐渐凋谢...
<i>Makes the rest of the world fade away.</i>

44
00:01:33,144 --> 00:01:34,644
我不想再谈这个了
- [Meredith] I don't want to talk. - [Derek] Meredith...

45
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:35,244
Meredith.
You didn't sign the divorce papers. Fine. End of discussion.

46
00:01:35,544 --> 00:01:37,144
你并没有签离婚协议.

47
00:01:37,244 --> 00:01:38,044
很好，我明白了.
- Meredith... - What?

48
00:01:38,144 --> 00:01:39,344
讨论到此结束. Meredith.

49
00:01:40,344 --> 00:01:41,044
干吗?!
<i>Until all we can think about</i> <i>is how much we hurt.</i>

50
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:43,144
直到我们都能仔细考虑...

51
00:01:43,844 --> 00:01:45,444
到底我们伤了多少...
I usually just say "Meredith" then you yell at me.

52
00:01:45,544 --> 00:01:47,444
每次当我刚刚叫你 "meredith," 的时候，你就开始对我大喊大叫了.

53
00:01:47,644 --> 00:01:49,644
我以前没想过这点.
I haven't thought past that point.

54
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:51,544
我事实上根本没有任何计划.
I actually didn't have anything planned.

55
00:01:51,844 --> 00:01:54,344
如何来控制我们的疼痛，全由我们自己作主.
- <i>How we manage our pain is up to us.</i> - What is that? Hey. Stop it.

56
00:01:54,544 --> 00:01:55,144
Hey, 别打了!
Seriously? Seriously!

57
00:01:56,244 --> 00:01:58,444
你认真的吗?! 真的吗?

58
00:01:58,744 --> 00:01:59,744
真的吗?
Seriously!

59
00:02:00,944 --> 00:02:02,444
这是一张非常非常小的床.
This is a very small bed.

60
00:02:03,744 --> 00:02:05,244
他是个脑外科医生.
He's a brain surgeon.

61
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:08,825
I look fantastic. I shaved my legs.

62
00:02:07,944 --> 00:02:09,144
我把腿毛都剃了.
He's a brain surgeon. How can he be so brainless?

63
00:02:09,244 --> 00:02:10,344
他是个脑外科医生.

64
00:02:10,444 --> 00:02:11,944
可是他怎么能如此没大脑呢?
- Hello? Seriously! - Seriously!

65
00:02:12,044 --> 00:02:14,144
Hello? 真的啊.

66

67
00:02:15,444 --> 00:02:17,344
Shh.

68
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,244
痛...
<i>Pain.</i>

69
00:02:21,644 --> 00:02:27,644
让我们麻痹，安全度过，拥抱它，忽视它...
- <i>We anesthetize...</i> - [lights pop]

70
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:26,910
<i>Ride it out, embrace it, ignore</i> it...

71
00:02:33,844 --> 00:02:39,044
对于我们当中的一些人来说 对待疼痛最好的办法就是咬牙挺过去.
<i>And for some of us, the best way to</i> <i>manage pain is to just push through it.</i>

72
00:02:45,844 --> 00:02:46,944
你正在滴水.
- You're dripping. - I'm back.

73
00:02:47,044 --> 00:02:48,444
我回来了.我只是想你明白
I just want to make that clear. I'm ready to work.

00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:49,844
我回来了,已经准备好重返工作岗位了.
- Has anyone seen Dr. Shepherd? - His name's on the OR board.

75
00:02:49,944 --> 00:02:51,644
今早有人见过Shepherd医生吗?

76
00:02:51,844 --> 00:02:53,944
他的名字在手术公告栏上. 他应该在这里的什么地方.
- He should be here somewhere. - I'm good. Ready to scrub in.

77
00:02:54,644 --> 00:02:56,244

81
00:03:00,544 --> 00:03:02,144
Mm-hmm. 你们过来吧.

怎么回事?
What? You're not talking to me anymore?

83

你再也不想和我说话了?
OK, what happened last night? What is going on with you?

84
00:03:07,744 --> 00:03:09,244
Okay, 昨晚到底怎么了?

85
00:03:09,444 --> 00:03:10,444
你到底怎么了?

86
00:03:11,244 --> 00:03:12,044
我很好.
I'm fine.

87
00:03:12,944 --> 00:03:13,844
你有什么问题?
- What's your problem? - [Snorts]

88
00:03:15,544 --> 00:03:16,344
没事.
Fine. You know what, Alex? No, I'm not talking to you anymore.

89
00:03:16,744 --> 00:03:17,644

90
00:03:17,744 --> 00:03:18,944

毛片.
Porn?

毛片?
- As in porn? - All right.

100
00:03:38,444 --> 00:03:39,244

and what you do in the privacy of your own...

105
00:03:49,944 --> 00:03:52,644
你们不能在这里看毛片. 这里是医院
Look, we can't have porn in here. This is a hospital.

106
00:03:52,844 --> 00:03:53,744
这是因为我的疼痛.
It's for my pain. My doc said it releases endorphins in the brain

107
00:03:54,244 --> 00:03:56,544
我医生说这个可以让我的大脑释放快感,

108
00:03:56,644 --> 00:03:59,244
这样可以帮助我的疼痛在一个可控制的范围内.

Hey, life is short. Times are hard.

一路上艰难险阻层出不穷.
The road is long with many a winding turn.

132
00:05:16,044 --> 00:05:17,544
他要你过去的,那你就过去吧.
He asked for you. Take it up with him.

141
00:05:40,344 --> 00:05:41,144
你甚至没下指令.
- You didn't call him. - I was here first.

142
00:05:41,244 --> 00:05:42,044
我不用下指令.
You got her first because I let you. Where's the chest films?

143
00:05:42,144 --> 00:05:42,644
我是第一个来的.

144
00:05:42,744 --> 00:05:44,144
你第一个来是因为我让你的

145
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:45,644
胸片在哪里?
I got it. You always get the surgery. Today, I'm getting a surgery.

146
00:05:46,044 --> 00:05:47,344
Unh.我来吧.

147
00:05:47,544 --> 00:05:49,944
你总是参加手术. 今天,轮到我了.

148
00:05:50,044 --> 00:05:51,144
你俩,有完没完.
Guys. Knock it off. He's one of Seattle's finest.

149
00:05:51,244 --> 00:05:52,344
他是西雅图的警察.
You've got an entire police force watching you.

150
00:05:52,844 --> 00:05:55,044
你俩让整个的警察队伍都在看着呢

151
00:05:59,244 --> 00:06:00,244
传呼Burke医生.
[George] Page Dr. Burke.

152
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,644
告诉他我这里有一个枪伤
- Let him know I'm bringing up a GSW. - "We" are bringing up a GSW.

153
00:06:07,844 --> 00:06:09,844
看起来你今天能回家了ellis.
Looks like you'll be able to go home today, Ellis.

154
00:06:09,944 --> 00:06:11,244
但是我还有病人要看.
- But I still have patients to see. - No. No more patients.

155
00:06:11,444 --> 00:06:14,144
不,没有病人了

156
00:06:14,844 --> 00:06:16,244
我过一会回来对你检查, okay?
I'll be back to check on you later, OK?

157
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:19,044
你应该知道我正在考虑离开cher.
You should know I'm thinking of leaving Thatcher.

158
00:06:20,744 --> 00:06:21,944
我根本就不该和他结婚.
I should never have married him.

159
00:06:22,644 --> 00:06:23,944
我要离开他,你离开adele.
I'll leave him. You leave Adele.

160
00:06:24,444 --> 00:06:26,044
然后当我们的实习期结束的时候,
Then when our residency's over we can both get jobs at the same hospital.

161
00:06:26,144 --> 00:06:27,844
我们可以在同一家医院找到工作

162
00:06:28,044 --> 00:06:30,844
护士你能去准备一下她出院需要的药吗?
Why don't you get her meds ready for discharge, nurse? Thank you.

163
00:06:30,944 --> 00:06:31,644
谢谢.

Ellis...
Ellis, that was a long time ago, remember?

166
00:06:39,244 --> 00:06:40,944
那是很久很久以前的事情了,记得吗?

167
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:44,344
我们在21年之前就讨论过这个.
We had this discussion 21 years ago.

168
00:06:44,444 --> 00:06:45,344
考虑考虑吧, richard.
Think about it. We should make the break now.

169
00:06:45,544 --> 00:06:46,644
我们应该现在就做
If we wait till residency's over, you'll be at one hospital, I'll be in another.

170
00:06:47,444 --> 00:06:49,944
如果真等我们实习期结束 你会在一个医院里

171
00:06:50,044 --> 00:06:50,944
而我在另外一间医院了.
We could end up at opposite ends of the country. It'll be too late.

172
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:54,544
最后我们可能会相隔十万八千里. 那时候就什么都晚了

- Meredith. - Your wife is looking for you.

175

你老婆正到处找你呢.
Oh, my God, this is hard for me, Meredith.

176
00:07:02,844 --> 00:07:03,844
Oh, 天.

177
00:07:03,944 --> 00:07:05,344
这个对我来说很难, meredith.
Let me make it easy. I'm not going to be that woman.

178
00:07:05,444 --> 00:07:06,344
那好,我来把它简单化

179
00:07:06,744 --> 00:07:07,944
我不会是那种女人...
The one who breaks up a marriage or begs you to want me.

180
00:07:08,144 --> 00:07:10,844
破坏你的婚姻 或者求你和我在一起.

181
00:07:10,944 --> 00:07:14,044
你可以签字离婚,也可以不签 你自己的选择
You can sign the papers or you can not. The choice is yours.

182
00:07:14,244 --> 00:07:16,844
当其中任何一个决定影响我们的关系时 我退出
Either way, when it comes to this relationship, I'm out.

183
00:07:17,144 --> 00:07:19,244
现在,你要我来帮助你的那个病人在哪里?
Now, where's this patient I'm supposed to be helping you with?

184
00:07:20,244 --> 00:07:21,244
那边.
Down there.

185
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:25,844
你不应该带着狗狗在雨中散步.
You shouldn't have walked the dog in the rain.

186
00:07:26,044 --> 00:07:28,744
Oh, lou, 和雨没有关系 我只不过昏倒了一下.
Oh, Lou, it wasn't the rain. I just passed out.

187
00:07:29,144 --> 00:07:30,244
事实上, Bradley太太--
- Actually, Mrs. Bradley... - Verna.

188
00:07:30,444 --> 00:07:30,944
verna.
Verna. You presented with lateral ST elevations

189
00:07:31,344 --> 00:07:36,744
Verna, 你的症状显示你的血小板很高 以及非常差的相反一致性改变并发心急梗塞

190
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:36,620
and reciprocal inferior changes consistent with an MI.

191
00:07:36,844 --> 00:07:37,744
也就是说,心脏病发作.
- A heart attack. - [Lou] Oh, my God.

192
00:07:37,844 --> 00:07:38,844
oh, 天.
Lou, don't worry.

193
00:07:39,244 --> 00:07:40,044
Lou, 别担心
I've had little chest pains before and it turned out to be nothing.

194
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:44,044
我之前也有过这样的胸部小疼痛 后来也没什么事了.

195
00:07:44,344 --> 00:07:44,944
没事的.
This is nothing.

196
00:07:47,844 --> 00:07:49,444
Lou, 别在医生面前.
Lou, not in front of the doctor.

197
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,344
我后背的阵痛持续了一段时间了
[Woman] I've had a twinge in my back for a while.

198
00:07:52,544 --> 00:07:56,244
我以为马上就会消失的 但是昨晚,我的腿失去知觉了,
I thought it would go away, but then last night, my legs went numb.

199
00:07:56,344 --> 00:07:58,244
然后今天早上,我的后背--
This morning, my back... The pain is just too much.

200
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:00,244
太疼了.

201
00:08:01,644 --> 00:08:03,244
Chue小姐,我会帮你按上一个P.C.A.仪器, (疼痛渗透控制仪)
Miss Chue, we'll put you on a PCA pump, give you morphine to control the pain.

202
00:08:03,644 --> 00:08:05,744
我会给你一些吗啡, 这个能帮你控制住疼痛.

203
00:08:05,844 --> 00:08:06,544
谢谢.
- Thank you. - OK. But there's a greater problem.

204
00:08:07,144 --> 00:08:08,244
但是有个更大的问题.
- I've just looked at your MRI... - Anna!

205
00:08:08,544 --> 00:08:09,644
我刚刚看了你的磁共振成像.--

206
00:08:09,644 --> 00:08:10,244
Anna...

207
00:08:12,844 --> 00:08:14,344
为什么你来之前没给我们打电话?
- Why didn't you call us before coming? - I'm sorry. These are my parents.

208
00:08:14,544 --> 00:08:15,044
对不起.

209
00:08:15,944 --> 00:08:16,844
这是我父母.

210
00:08:17,744 --> 00:08:18,244
Hi.
- Hi. - What's going on?

211
00:08:18,544 --> 00:08:19,044
怎么回事?
Anna's MRI has shown that she has a myxopapillary ependymoma.

212
00:08:19,344 --> 00:08:21,244
我刚刚想解释一下anna的磁共振成像.

213
00:08:21,344 --> 00:08:23,444
显示她有一个室鼓膜瘤--

214
00:08:23,844 --> 00:08:25,844
是在脊椎槽道里面的肿瘤,
It's a tumor in her spinal canal.

215
00:08:26,244 --> 00:08:28,044
好消息是,我们可以做手术取出.
But the good news is that we can operate.

216
00:08:28,444 --> 00:08:32,744
你有95%的机会可以完全康复 如果我们尽快准备手术的话.
You have a 95% chance of fully recovering

217
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,506
if we get you to surgery as soon as possible.

218
00:08:32,844 --> 00:08:34,044
一刻也不能再等了
We can't wait. With a tumor this aggressive

219
00:08:34,144 --> 00:08:35,244
这个肿瘤的侵略性相当快,
even waiting another day puts you at risk for permanent paralysis.

220
00:08:35,344 --> 00:08:38,144
即使只是晚一天手术的话 你都会有终身瘫痪的危险

221
00:08:39,844 --> 00:08:40,644
爹?
Father?

222
00:08:42,844 --> 00:08:43,844
不
No. No surgery.

223
00:08:44,744 --> 00:08:45,444
绝不手术
Mr. Chue, without surgery, Anna will be paralyzed within the next 24 hours.

224
00:08:46,444 --> 00:08:47,644
Chue先生,如果不手术的话,

225
00:08:47,844 --> 00:08:50,344
anna很可能在未来24小时内瘫痪.

226
00:08:50,844 --> 00:08:51,944
今天绝不手术
No surgery today. We're taking her home.

227
00:08:52,044 --> 00:08:53,144
我们带她回家.
- Anna needs surgery. - She can have it another time.

228
00:08:53,244 --> 00:08:54,344
Anna需要手术

229
00:08:54,644 --> 00:08:56,044
那她可以其他时间再做
- Mr. Chue... - We are taking our daughter home.

230
00:08:56,144 --> 00:08:56,744
Chue先生--

231
00:08:56,844 --> 00:08:58,844
我们要把女儿带回家

232
00:09:02,144 --> 00:09:03,244
Anna, 你已经过18岁了
Anna, you're over 18. You don't need your father's consent.

233
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:05,644
你不需要你父亲的同意

234
00:09:09,344 --> 00:09:11,844
我是hmong信徒,我父亲是长者
I'm Hmong, and my father is the elder.

235
00:09:13,244 --> 00:09:14,844
如果他让我回家,我就回家
If he says I go home, I go home.

236
00:09:19,844 --> 00:09:21,544
Hmong? 找找什么意思.
Hmong? Let's find out what that means.

237
00:09:21,844 --> 00:09:22,944
Okay.联络社工.
Contact Social Services, see if we can get somebody to talk to them.

238
00:09:23,144 --> 00:09:25,244
看看我们是否能找个人下来和他谈谈.

239
00:09:25,644 --> 00:09:27,344
我还需要继续处理她出院的要求吗?
- Do I process her discharge? - Yeah. It's insane, but we have to.

240
00:09:27,444 --> 00:09:28,844
Yeah,我们必须这么做,虽然太愚蠢了, 我们还是需要这么做
It reminds me of a case I had in New York where a woman...

241
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:31,544
这个病例让我想起来我在纽约的时候 有一次这个女人来我的办公室--

242
00:09:31,844 --> 00:09:33,844
你还需要我做什么和工作有关的吗?
Look, do you need me for anything else work-related?

243
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:40,244
听着,我结婚11年了
Look. I was married for 11 years. Addison is my family.

244
00:09:40,644 --> 00:09:44,744
Addison是我的家人. 那是11个感恩节,11个生日,11个圣诞节,
That is 11 Thanksgivings, 11 birthdays, and 11 Christmases.

245
00:09:44,844 --> 00:09:47,644
然后有一天,我要来签字 来结束我的家人?
In one day, I'm supposed to sign a piece of paper and end my family?

246
00:09:48,344 --> 00:09:50,744
一个正常的人不会这么做的- 不会一点都不犹豫.
A person doesn't do that. Not without hesitation.

247
00:09:51,044 --> 00:09:52,844
我有权利有一点点的不确定.
I'm entitled to a little uncertainty. A moment to understand the magnitude

248
00:09:53,244 --> 00:09:57,144
只是需要一点时间来弄明白 从我生命中夺走一个人到底对我意味着什么.
of what it means to cut somebody out of my life.

249
00:09:57,544 --> 00:10:02,244
我有权至少有那么一分钟,痛苦的怀疑
- I'm entitled to at least one moment... - [door opens]

250
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:02,264
...of painful doubt.

251
00:10:02,344 --> 00:10:05,144
如果你能有那么一点点谅解的话,一定很好.
And a little understanding from you would be nice.

252
00:10:09,244 --> 00:10:10,744
Shepherd医生,还没走呢,我明白了.
- Dr. Shepherd. Still here, I see. - I couldn't leave you.

253
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:11,944
我不能离开你们.
- Have you seen the other Dr. Shepherd? - I'll tell him you're looking for him.

254
00:10:12,344 --> 00:10:13,744
见过Shepherd医生吗?

255
00:10:13,944 --> 00:10:15,144
我会转告他你在找他

256
00:10:16,944 --> 00:10:20,244
那个,谢谢,就是,陪着我.
- So, thanks for, you know, being there. - No thanks needed.

257
00:10:20,544 --> 00:10:21,244
不需要感谢
- OK. - So where are we?

258
00:10:21,744 --> 00:10:22,344
Okay.

Oh, 我可以回来工作了.
- Oh, I'm getting back on my feet. - Fine.

262
00:10:28,944 --> 00:10:29,344
很好.
- That doesn't mean that... - Cristina...

00:16:42,821 --> 00:16:43,421
我知道.
- Derek. - Yes?

413
00:16:44,521 --> 00:16:44,921
Derek.
Talk to Anna's father. I'd do it myself but having testicles is a requirement.

414
00:16:45,021 --> 00:16:45,421
Yes.

415
00:16:46,021 --> 00:16:47,021
你需要和anna的父亲谈谈.

416
00:16:47,121 --> 00:16:50,121
我已经做了,但是我猜 最好是找个带种的来和他谈.

417
00:16:50,221 --> 00:16:51,321
社工怎么了?
- What happened to Social Services? - According to Anna, they can't help us.

418
00:16:52,121 --> 00:16:53,921
按照anna说法,他们根本帮不了什么.
Anna's father believes she's missing something she needs for surgery.

419
00:16:54,321 --> 00:16:57,721
很显然,anna的父亲认为 手术会导致她失去一些东西.

420
00:16:57,821 --> 00:16:59,221
失去一些东西?什么?
- Missing something? Missing what? - One of her souls.

421
00:16:59,321 --> 00:17:00,721
她的一个灵魂.

422
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:03,921
我们不需要社工了,我们需要一个巫师.
We don't need a social worker. We need a shaman.

423
00:17:04,821 --> 00:17:06,221
巫师?
Shaman?

424
00:17:07,521 --> 00:17:09,221
Cardio告诉我你的心脏导管插入干的不错.
Cardio tells me your cath went just fine.

425
00:17:09,521 --> 00:17:11,021
那些擦伤是正常的吗?
- Is that much bruising normal? - Your wound looks good.

426
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:13,421
Bradley太太,你的伤口看起来没事,
So do the results on your cath. You have no blockages in your arteries.

427
00:17:13,521 --> 00:17:14,821
心脏导管插入的结果也没事.

428
00:17:14,921 --> 00:17:16,621
你没有动脉血塞.
- Which means? - You did not have a heart attack.

429
00:17:16,921 --> 00:17:17,421
你的意思是?

430
00:17:17,521 --> 00:17:19,221
你绝对没有心脏病

431
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:21,239
[Both chuckle]

432
00:17:22,021 --> 00:17:22,821
那么我能回家了?
- So I can go home? - Not yet.

433
00:17:23,321 --> 00:17:23,721
还没.
Your EKG shows significant changes.

434
00:17:24,321 --> 00:17:25,721
你的心电图有很大的变化,

435
00:17:26,021 --> 00:17:28,821
我要在你出院之前找到原因.
And I'm going to find out why before you leave the hospital.

436
00:17:33,421 --> 00:17:34,821
Hey, pete,你干吗呢?
- Hey, Pete, what are you doing? - I have to get home.

437
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:36,421
我要回家.
- Pete, you're in the hospital. - Need to get home. Need to get home.

438
00:17:36,821 --> 00:17:37,821
Pete, 你在医院呢.

439
00:17:38,421 --> 00:17:39,421
我要回家

440
00:17:40,721 --> 00:17:41,221
我必须回家
- What's his blood pressure? - It's not reading. He's too agitated.

441
00:17:41,821 --> 00:17:42,621
他血压如何?

442
00:17:43,121 --> 00:17:44,421
读不出来,他太激动了.
- How's his pulse? - Thready, but still there.

443
00:17:44,921 --> 00:17:45,721
脉搏呢?

444
00:17:45,821 --> 00:17:46,821
像线一样,不过至少还有
- Do you have instruments? - A code box and gloves.

445
00:17:46,921 --> 00:17:48,021
你们那边有什么工具吗?

446
00:17:48,421 --> 00:17:49,821
只有密码箱和几副手套.
You didn't bring an open chest tray?

447
00:17:49,921 --> 00:17:51,121
你们没带个开胸盘?
- We thought... - No time for excuses.

448
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:52,521
没有,我们以为--
- Blood pressure. - I've taken it three times.

449
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:54,321
你没时间找借口.O'malley,血压.

450
00:17:54,621 --> 00:17:55,721
我已经测了3次了.
- And? - I can't hear a systolic over 50.

451
00:17:55,821 --> 00:17:56,221
然后呢?

452
00:17:56,421 --> 00:17:57,921
我听不到50次以上的心跳.

453
00:18:01,821 --> 00:18:02,421
他快要挂了.
He's gonna die.

454
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,219
[Pete groans]

455
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,521
插喉,我马上回来.
- Intubate him. I'll be back. - Where are you going?

456
00:18:10,621 --> 00:18:11,321
等等,你去哪里?
To get an instrument tray. You guys are going to have to open up his chest.

457
00:18:12,021 --> 00:18:13,221
去拿一件开胸的工具.

458
00:18:13,421 --> 00:18:15,221
你们要把他的胸腔打开

459
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,061
[Pete groans]

460
00:18:19,421 --> 00:18:20,321
你确定吗?
- Are you sure about that? - No.

461
00:18:21,021 --> 00:18:21,421
不.

462
00:18:38,521 --> 00:18:39,521
burke什么时候回来?

463
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:43,177
When's Burke coming back?

464
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,950
[Distant thunder]

465
00:18:48,236 --> 00:18:49,836
Burke医生什么时候回来?
When is Dr. Burke coming back?

466
00:18:51,036 --> 00:18:51,636
Alex?
- Alex... - Oh, would you shut up?

467
00:18:51,736 --> 00:18:52,436
Oh,你能闭嘴吗?

468
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,794
[Thunder]

469
00:18:59,636 --> 00:19:00,536
Chue先生...
Mr. Chue. You want to take Anna home for a healing ritual?

470
00:19:01,936 --> 00:19:03,736
你要把anna带回家做个治疗法事?
When sickness comes, it means that one of our souls is missing.

471
00:19:04,336 --> 00:19:07,236
当疾病降临的时候, 那意味着我们其中的一个灵魂正在丢失.

472
00:19:07,936 --> 00:19:10,336
Anna需要在手术前,找回她完整的灵魂.
Anna needs to have her souls intact before surgery.

473
00:19:11,036 --> 00:19:12,036
她需要个巫师.
- She needs a shaman. - Well, you could have told me that.

474
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:13,636
你可以告诉我这个.
Why? So you could call me a fool?

475
00:19:14,636 --> 00:19:16,736
为什么? 那样你就可以把我看成傻瓜了?

476
00:19:17,136 --> 00:19:19,736
我尊重你的传统 尽管我不理解
I respect that you have traditions that I can't understand.

477
00:19:20,436 --> 00:19:22,936
但是你穿着这身3000美元的西装,
But you're standing beside me in a $3,000 suit

478
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:25,336
我相信你同时也尊重我告诉你的事实
so I know you respect that I'm telling you

479
00:19:25,736 --> 00:19:29,236
Anna如果想要继续行走的话, 她需要在未来的24小时内尽快手术
Anna needs surgery in the next 24 hours if she's going to continue to walk.

480
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:31,336
她不能离开医院.
She can't leave this hospital.

481
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:39,036
她不能在没有灵魂的情况下手术,她会死的.
She can't undergo surgery without her soul. She'd die.

482
00:19:39,036 --> 00:19:39,736
那么好吧
All right then.

483
00:19:41,136 --> 00:19:44,336
我们就找来一个巫师吧,今天,就在医院里.
We're just gonna have to get a shaman. Today. In the hospital.

484
00:19:45,036 --> 00:19:46,936
巫师并没有在电话薄上登记.
Shamans aren't in the Yellow Pages.

485
00:19:47,136 --> 00:19:48,936
我们的巫师离这里有50英里.
Our shaman is 500 miles from here. You are an arrogant man.

486
00:19:49,136 --> 00:19:50,436
你真是个自大狂.
No. I'm just a guy with access to a helicopter.

487
00:19:50,836 --> 00:19:53,536
不,我仅仅是个有权使用直升飞机的人罢了

488
00:19:58,836 --> 00:19:59,236
谢谢
Thank you.

489
00:20:01,736 --> 00:20:03,136
找到她的灵魂并不容易.
- Finding her soul won't be easy. - It never is.

490
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:04,236
决不.

491
00:20:06,236 --> 00:20:07,336
这太不合理了.
[Richard] This is unconscionable. Not enough power to move those elevators?

492
00:20:07,636 --> 00:20:09,436
难道没有足够电力来移动电梯吗?
They're replacing the backup. Fire department is standing by.

493
00:20:09,536 --> 00:20:11,736
他们正在努力取代备用发电机.

494
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:12,936
消防队随时准备
- Critical patients? - Moved to south wing.

495
00:20:13,036 --> 00:20:13,936
所有的重病患者呢?
- Incoming trauma? - Rerouted to Mercy West.

496
00:20:14,036 --> 00:20:14,936
搬到南翼去了.

497
00:20:15,036 --> 00:20:15,536
外伤患者呢?

498
00:20:15,936 --> 00:20:17,136
都送去 mercy west医院了.
- That backup should have been replaced. - Yes, sir.

499
00:20:17,236 --> 00:20:19,436
备用发电机应该去年就换了.

500
00:20:19,536 --> 00:20:20,036
是的,先生
- Why didn't it happen? - Chief, you'd have to ask maintenance.

501
00:20:20,236 --> 00:20:20,936
为什么没有?

502
00:20:21,236 --> 00:20:24,936
头儿,你应该去问维修部.

503
00:20:25,236 --> 00:20:26,536
我不想知道
- I wouldn't know. - Dr. Bailey, you know everything.

504
00:20:26,936 --> 00:20:27,436
Bailey医生,

505
00:20:27,836 --> 00:20:29,136
你知道所有的事情
Tell me whose butt to kick.

506
00:20:29,536 --> 00:20:30,836
告诉我谁应该开除.

507
00:20:32,136 --> 00:20:33,936
那应该是你,头儿
That would be your butt, Chief.

508
00:20:34,236 --> 00:20:38,436
你没有批准发电机的更新, 省钱要买一个新的磁共振成像仪.
You didn't authorize the replacement generator,

509
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,635
saving money for the new MRI machine.

510
00:20:39,336 --> 00:20:44,936
Um... 我需要回去处理..手术室
Um...

511
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:44,202
I need to get on back down to the... OR.

512
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:48,502
<i>[Monitor beeps]</i>

513
00:20:55,136 --> 00:20:55,936
Hey.
Hey, this isn't gonna be too sterile, but we can still try.

514
00:20:56,336 --> 00:20:57,436
这个不可能太危险了,

515
00:20:57,736 --> 00:20:58,436
但是我们还是要试试.
Prep and drape the patient.

516
00:20:59,136 --> 00:21:00,136
准备病人开胸.

517
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:30,715
[Thunder]

518
00:21:33,336 --> 00:21:36,536
Hey, 能给我 verna bradley所有的病历吗?
Can you get me copies of all Verna Bradley's records and page me?

519
00:21:36,636 --> 00:21:38,336
然后呼我,我会在手术室那层
- I'll be on the OR floor. - <i>[PA] Dr. Bennett...</i>

520
00:21:39,136 --> 00:21:40,336
hey, 哪里, um,
Hey! Wait... Where are you two going so fast?

521
00:21:40,836 --> 00:21:42,236
hey, 你们俩这么急着去哪里啊?
Burke is talking George and Alex through heart surgery in the elevator.

522
00:21:42,336 --> 00:21:45,036
Burke正在教george和alex如何在电梯里做心脏手术.

523
00:21:45,736 --> 00:21:47,936
Shepherd在准备一个巫师手术前法事.
Shepherd's setting up a shaman healing ritual.

524
00:21:48,836 --> 00:21:49,436
动起来啊.
Rock on.

525
00:21:50,636 --> 00:21:51,836
我还有个毛片大王呢.
I have porn guy.

526
00:21:54,436 --> 00:21:56,136
救命啊.
[Mr. Lamott] Help! Please!

527
00:21:57,836 --> 00:21:58,836
Lamott先生,怎么了?
Mr. Lamott? What's wrong?

528
00:22:00,436 --> 00:22:01,436
你的血压提高了
Your pressure's elevated.

529
00:22:03,236 --> 00:22:04,336
脉搏很快.
Pulse is racing. You're really in pain.

530
00:22:04,836 --> 00:22:05,936
这次你可是真的疼了哦.
What? Do you think?

531
00:22:06,036 --> 00:22:06,636
那你想什么呢?
Are you telling me the porn actually sedated you?

532
00:22:08,236 --> 00:22:11,036
你是要告诉我,那毛片的确让你镇静下来吗?

533
00:22:11,236 --> 00:22:12,736
你想什么呢?我是那种变态
You think I'm a pervert, watching that stuff in front of you?

534
00:22:12,836 --> 00:22:14,136
在你面前看毛片?
Well... yes.

535
00:22:15,436 --> 00:22:16,036
是啊
OK, OK.

536
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:18,636
Oh, okay. Okay.

537
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:24,837
[Sighs] You're allergic to most narcotics and NSAIDs.

538
00:22:22,136 --> 00:22:25,036
你对大部分的止痛剂过敏

539
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:29,736
我猜,我们可以试试droperidol和diphenhydramine.
I suppose we can try droperidol and diphenhydramine.

540
00:22:29,836 --> 00:22:31,536
去年这些让我昏迷了.
That put me into a coma last year.

541
00:22:32,736 --> 00:22:35,636
那我去找一个麻醉师来吧.
Well, I can get an anesthesiologist down here.

542
00:22:36,036 --> 00:22:37,836
Oh, 不行,你明天就手术了
But with your surgery tomorrow, he won't give you an epidural block.

543
00:22:37,936 --> 00:22:39,336
我觉得他不会给你个局部麻醉.
- What am I gonna do? - Uh... hold on.

544
00:22:39,836 --> 00:22:40,636
那我怎么办啊?

545
00:22:41,436 --> 00:22:41,553
Uh, 等一下.

546
00:22:52,203 --> 00:22:52,335
我们真要这么做啊?
We're really gonna do this.

547
00:23:01,675 --> 00:23:01,777
接着.
Take these.

548
00:23:08,479 --> 00:23:08,626
Karev, 接着手术刀.
Karev, take the scalpel.

549
00:23:15,954 --> 00:23:16,101
Alex,快点
Alex! Come on.

550
00:23:20,227 --> 00:23:20,300
Alex.
Alex!

551
00:23:35,043 --> 00:23:35,248
鼓风.
Ventilate!

552
00:23:38,499 --> 00:23:38,587
我来.
[George] I got it.

553
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:48,375
现在我做什么
What do I do?

554
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:52,151
Make a large, anterior, lateral, midaxillary incision

555
00:23:50,337 --> 00:23:51,204
在腋中前面偏一点的位置 尽量大的切开直至第五条动脉间的空隙.

556
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,892
in the fifth intercostal space.

557
00:23:59,712 --> 00:23:59,844
多大?
- How... How large? - [Burke] As long as possible.

558
00:24:01,554 --> 00:24:01,848
尽量大.你需要两只手都能伸进去.
You need to get two hands in there. It needs to be long and deep.

559
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,180
要够长够深
- Use the scissors if you have to. - OK.

560
00:24:05,858 --> 00:24:06,049
如果有需要,可以用剪刀

561
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:07,632
Okay.

562
00:24:11,111 --> 00:24:11,331
但是要小心别切到肺或者心脏.
- Don't cut into the lung or heart. - How can I be sure of that?

563
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,447
我们如何小心这个?
You just have to be sure.

564
00:24:15,822 --> 00:24:15,969
你就需要小心就对了.

565
00:24:28,163 --> 00:24:28,354
我们不是在堪撒斯了.
We're not in Kansas any more.

566
00:24:49,673 --> 00:24:49,834
你的巫师迟到了
Your shaman's late.

567
00:24:51,873 --> 00:24:53,573
我们的巫师从来不迟到.
My shaman is never late.

568
00:24:58,573 --> 00:24:59,773
你们能看到什么吗?
Can you see anything? Poor George, he doesn't have the steadiest hands.

569
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:02,173
可怜的george. 他胳膊一直在颤抖.

570
00:25:02,973 --> 00:25:03,873
Izzie. Yeah.
- Izzie. - Yeah?

571
00:25:03,973 --> 00:25:06,473
他能听到你
He can hear you.

572
00:25:07,773 --> 00:25:09,473
o'malley...下面怎么样了?
O'Malley? How you doing down there?

573
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,673
The fire department's here.

574
00:25:13,473 --> 00:25:15,473
消防队的人来了,他们能打开门.
- They can get the doors open... - No.

575
00:25:15,573 --> 00:25:17,673
不,谁也别动 谁也别动电梯
Nobody works on the elevator.

576
00:25:18,273 --> 00:25:20,473
我有一个正在开胸并且非常紧张的实习生在那里.
I have an open chest and a very nervous intern in there. Keep them back.

577
00:25:20,573 --> 00:25:21,973
没有我的命令不要让他们过来
- OK, guys, we're not going... - O'Malley?

578
00:25:22,573 --> 00:25:23,473
Okay,  你们,我们不要....

579
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:24,373
o'malley...

580
00:25:26,873 --> 00:25:28,173
我没有切到心脏或者肺.
Dr. Burke, I didn't cut the heart or the lungs.

581
00:25:28,273 --> 00:25:29,873
Burke医生,我没有切到心脏或者肺.
Good, good, O'Malley. Really good.

582
00:25:30,273 --> 00:25:30,973
Okay, 很好

583
00:25:31,073 --> 00:25:32,173
好o'malley. 非常好.
Now, check for injuries and do a pericardiotomy.

584
00:25:32,773 --> 00:25:35,673
现在检查伤口,然后做心包切开术.

585
00:25:35,873 --> 00:25:39,873
我需要一些包垫,镊子,以及夹钳.
I'll need some lap pads, forceps, Metzenbaums and Satinsky clamps?

586
00:25:43,373 --> 00:25:44,173
遵命.
Yes, you will.

587
00:25:45,973 --> 00:25:48,473
你要是告诉其他人我为你做了这个,
You tell anyone I did this for you,

588
00:25:48,573 --> 00:25:51,873
不仅我会杀了你, 我还会把你尸体切成小块换钱花.
not only will I kill you, I will sell your body parts for cash.

589
00:25:54,273 --> 00:25:58,373
Okay. 那么....那些女人们
OK. So...

590
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:59,789
There were these women. Nurses.

591
00:25:59,473 --> 00:26:01,473
护士,3个护士
Three nurses. And they were... naughty.

592
00:26:01,573 --> 00:26:04,573
他们正在...淘气

593
00:26:05,873 --> 00:26:07,573
他们非常非常淘气
They were really, really naughty. They were three naughty nurses. Saucy, even.

594
00:26:08,273 --> 00:26:09,273
他们是三个淘气俏护士

595
00:26:09,673 --> 00:26:13,973
很漂亮--他们又漂亮,又不乖,又调皮.
They were saucy and bad and naughty. Three saucy, bad, naughty nurses.

596
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:15,973
三个漂亮的调皮小护士--
They were taking a shower. Together.

597
00:26:16,473 --> 00:26:18,473
他们在谈论洗澡.

598
00:26:19,173 --> 00:26:20,173
在给彼此擦浴液,
Soaping each other up. And then this doctor walks in

599
00:26:20,673 --> 00:26:22,573
就在这个时候,医生进来了,

600
00:26:23,073 --> 00:26:26,573
他看到了那3个调皮的小护士
and he sees these three naughty, bad nurses

601
00:26:27,073 --> 00:26:29,173
和她们那很大的...
with these great big...

602
00:26:29,573 --> 00:26:34,973
Bradley太太, 你有意识到在过去的7年中 在这同一天里你都会住进医院吗?
Mrs. Bradley, do you realize that you've been admitted to the hospital

603
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,921
on this date for the past seven years?

604
00:26:35,073 --> 00:26:35,973
Oh,不可能
That can't be.

605
00:26:37,073 --> 00:26:38,873
我不确定具体的日子,但是--
- I don't remember the date exactly... - I have the medical records.

606
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:40,073
我有医疗记录.
On this date for the past seven years you have what looks like a heart attack.

607
00:26:40,773 --> 00:26:44,573
在过去7年的同一天里, 你一直都像心脏病发作一样.

608
00:26:45,373 --> 00:26:49,073
不,不,我知道我有一些害怕 但是我没有--
No. No, I know I've had some scares but I don't...

609
00:26:49,173 --> 00:26:50,973
每年的今天吗?
Every year on this date?

610
00:26:52,073 --> 00:26:54,673
这一天对你个人来说有什么特别的意义吗?
Is there significance to this date for you?

611
00:26:54,773 --> 00:26:56,473
没有
No. Nothing.

612
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,973
第一年你在做什么,
What were you doing the first time you had a cardiac episode?

613
00:26:58,073 --> 00:26:59,973
你第一次有心脏病的时候?
Who can remember back that far?

614
00:27:00,473 --> 00:27:02,473
Oh,谁能记着那么久的事情啊?

615
00:27:02,873 --> 00:27:05,773
我们在院子里 我能记着,因为我们的邻居--
We were in the yard. I remember because our neighbor... What was his name?

616
00:27:05,873 --> 00:27:06,773
他叫什么?
- Ted. - That's right. He died.

617
00:27:07,573 --> 00:27:08,173
Ted.

618
00:27:08,673 --> 00:27:11,673
对,我想他死于动脉瘤.
Of an aneurysm, I think.

619
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:15,173
我们看着殡仪馆的人把他抬走,
And we watched as the funeral home people took him away

620
00:27:15,573 --> 00:27:17,273
之后你就第一次发作心脏病了
and you had your first attack.

621
00:27:17,573 --> 00:27:18,673
你和ted很亲近吗?
- And you were close to Ted? - No. We barely knew Ted.

622
00:27:18,873 --> 00:27:22,073
不. Oh, 我们对ted了解很少.

623
00:27:22,373 --> 00:27:25,773
那让人很难过 但是这和verna心脏有什么关系呢?
That was all very sad, but what does that have to do with Verna's heart?

624
00:27:32,073 --> 00:27:34,073
我从心包膜中取出了一个小血块.
I removed a small clot from the pericardium.

625
00:27:35,073 --> 00:27:36,473
没有显著的心脏损伤.
- No obvious cardiac injuries. - Change in the vitals?

626
00:27:36,773 --> 00:27:37,673
情况有改变吗?
- BP's still too low to register. - We need to cross-clamp the aorta.

627
00:27:37,773 --> 00:27:39,873
B.P.还是很低,无法显示

628
00:27:39,973 --> 00:27:41,273
我们需要交叉夹住大动脉.

629
00:27:47,173 --> 00:27:51,973
一直夹着,直到你能感觉到 两个管状结构再松开
Stick your hand in and bluntly dissect down

630
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,533
until you feel two tube-like structures.

631
00:27:52,373 --> 00:27:55,173
食道应该在中间偏前的位置.
The esophagus will be more medial and anterior.

632
00:27:56,473 --> 00:27:58,673
Um,我能感觉到一个血管像衣领一样,
I feel one tube that's easily collapsible

633
00:27:59,373 --> 00:28:02,873
另外一个,更多肌肉,很柔软
and the other's more muscular, spongy.

634
00:28:03,573 --> 00:28:06,373
我能感觉到脊骨就在下面
I feel... I can feel the spine just underneath it.

635
00:28:06,473 --> 00:28:07,773
对,你正在触摸大动脉.
- Yes! You're touching the aorta. - I'm touching the aorta.

636
00:28:09,373 --> 00:28:10,573
我在触摸大动脉.
Wrap the index finger of your left hand around it

637
00:28:10,973 --> 00:28:16,073
绕着你左手的食指缠上 然后用你的右手拿着夹钳.

638
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:16,087
and apply the Satinsky clamp with your right hand.

639
00:28:23,073 --> 00:28:23,673
搞定了.
Got it. Wait, I... I think I can localize the bleeding.

640
00:28:24,573 --> 00:28:27,373
等下,我想我能止住流血

641
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:29,973
我想流血来自于次级腔动脉.
It's coming from the inferior vena cava.

642
00:28:30,173 --> 00:28:31,073
能找到伤口吗?
- Can you find the lesion? - Yeah. Yeah, I think I can feel it.

643
00:28:31,973 --> 00:28:32,573
Yeah.

644
00:28:33,473 --> 00:28:34,673
Yeah, 我想我能感觉到.

645
00:28:36,773 --> 00:28:37,973
处理起来有点远.
- It's too far in to repair. - How big is it?

646
00:28:38,073 --> 00:28:39,273
有多大?
Small, maybe... smaller than a dime.

647
00:28:39,273 --> 00:28:41,673
很小,可能比一个一角硬币还小.

648
00:28:41,973 --> 00:28:45,273
Okay, o'malley, 我要你把你的手指插到那个洞里面.
OK, O'Malley. I want you to take your finger and plug the hole.

649
00:28:50,473 --> 00:28:52,973
我能感觉到他的心脏开始填满了.
I can feel his heart starting to fill more. It's beating a little stronger.

650
00:28:53,673 --> 00:28:54,873
跳动比以前强一些了.
- Excellent. Keep your finger there. - OK. Now what?

651
00:28:55,073 --> 00:28:55,473
好极了.

652
00:28:55,873 --> 00:28:56,773
你手指继续留在那边.

653
00:28:57,273 --> 00:28:58,373
Okay. 现在怎么办?

654
00:29:00,073 --> 00:29:00,673
就这些.
- That's it. - That's it?

655
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:02,373
就这些?

656
00:29:06,973 --> 00:29:09,673
我就这么站着,手指插在洞里?
[George] I just stand here with my finger plugging the hole?

657
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:12,973
直到我们把你们弄出来,送到手术室为止
Until we can get you out of that elevator and into the OR.

658
00:29:13,973 --> 00:29:14,773
Bailey医生,
Bailey, you can tell the firemen to get my guys out of there.

659
00:29:15,173 --> 00:29:17,073
你可以让消防员过来把我的人弄出来了
Will do. OK. We're ready.

660
00:29:17,373 --> 00:29:17,973
马上就去.

661
00:29:18,573 --> 00:29:19,373
Okay,我们准备好了

662
00:29:22,173 --> 00:29:22,973
O'malley.
- O'Malley. - Yes, sir?

663
00:29:23,373 --> 00:29:23,873
是的先生.
You just flew solo.

664
00:29:24,673 --> 00:29:25,673
你刚刚干的很漂亮.

665
00:29:28,873 --> 00:29:29,573
谢谢先生.
Thank you, sir.

666
00:29:41,573 --> 00:29:44,373
Okay, anna,我们现在要关掉PCA机器了,
OK, Anna, we're going to shut off the PCA pump now,

667
00:29:44,473 --> 00:29:47,373
这意味着你会感觉很痛--
which means you'll be in a lot of pain for the duration of...

668
00:29:47,473 --> 00:29:48,373
在治疗法事期间.
- The healing ritual. - Are you OK with that?

669
00:29:48,873 --> 00:29:49,773
你对这个没问题吧?
Yeah. They can't find my soul if I'm medicated.

670
00:29:50,073 --> 00:29:53,773
是的,如果我在用药的话,我就找不到我的灵魂了.

671
00:29:54,673 --> 00:29:56,073
没有痛苦没有收获,对吗?
- No pain, no gain, right? - It's not just for your father.

672
00:29:56,173 --> 00:29:57,373
这不仅仅是为了你父亲.
You believe it too, right?

673
00:29:57,573 --> 00:29:58,773
你也相信这个,对吗?
I know it sounds like a load of crap but watch the ritual. You'll see.

674
00:29:59,273 --> 00:30:00,773
我知道这听起来很不可思议,

675
00:30:00,873 --> 00:30:03,773
但是看看法事,你们就会明白了.

676
00:30:03,973 --> 00:30:04,673
看什么?
- See what? - The moment it happens.

677
00:30:05,673 --> 00:30:06,873
出现的那一刻.
[& Mike Doughty: <i>I Hear The Bells]</i>

678
00:30:28,073 --> 00:30:28,873
我准备好了.
I'm ready.

679
00:30:35,342 --> 00:30:38,942
Oh, yes, 我是这么这么淘气的
"Oh, yes! I'm so very, very naughty,"

680
00:30:40,342 --> 00:30:43,542
bianca 说就像她一样,把听诊器掉了.
Bianca said as she dropped her stethoscope.

681
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:46,442
"我也是," crystal说
"Me too!" said Crystal as she snapped on her surgical glove.

682
00:30:46,642 --> 00:30:48,842
然后她大力的吮吸她的医用手套

683
00:30:49,242 --> 00:30:51,642
然后还有marta...
And then there was Marta...

684
00:31:02,442 --> 00:31:03,042
我说到哪儿了?
- Where was I? - Marta.

685
00:31:03,542 --> 00:31:04,242
Marta.
Oh, yes. Marta was the naughtiest nurse of all because she knew how...

686
00:31:04,742 --> 00:31:09,942
Oh, yes. marta是他们中最淘气的护士了 因为她知道如何--

- Oh, thank God. - [Man] We're back up.

689
00:31:13,142 --> 00:31:13,842
回来了.

690
00:31:26,842 --> 00:31:28,842
你认为找回一个迷失的灵魂需要多久?
How long do you think it takes to retrieve a lost soul?

691
00:31:35,342 --> 00:31:36,142
我不知道
I don't know.

692
00:31:38,242 --> 00:31:39,342
准备走了, george.
- Way to go, George. - I have my finger in a heart.

693
00:31:39,742 --> 00:31:40,842
我手指还在他的心脏里呢.

大部分时候,疼痛可以控制.
<i>[Meredith] Most of the time,</i> <i>pain can be managed.</i>

842
00:41:29,498 --> 00:41:30,498
再给我倒一杯
Pour me another one.

843
00:41:31,498 --> 00:41:34,998
但是有时候,疼痛在你 最不期待的时候出现...
<i>But sometimes, the pain gets you</i> <i>when you least expect it.</i>

844
00:41:35,098 --> 00:41:37,198
我在告诉你呢,任何时候.
I'm telling you. Any second.

845
00:41:39,298 --> 00:41:42,998
疼痛来的不择手段而且无法停止.
<i>Hits way below the belt</i> <i>and doesn't let up.</i>

846
00:41:48,198 --> 00:41:51,198
我到处找你.
I have been looking... everywhere for you.

847
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:52,369
Well...

848
00:41:52,198 --> 00:41:56,398
那...你现在找到我了.

849
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:56,540
- You found me. - So...

850
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:57,698
所以...
you going to sign those divorce papers or not?

851
00:41:57,998 --> 00:41:59,798
你会在离婚协议书上签字,还是不会?

852
00:42:03,098 --> 00:42:03,998
疼痛--
<i>Pain. You just have to fight through.</i>

853
00:42:04,498 --> 00:42:08,198
你只需要奋力与之搏斗

854
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:09,115
<i>Because the truth is</i> <i>you can't outrun it.</i>

855
00:42:08,598 --> 00:42:13,098
因为事实是,你没办法逃脱, 而且生活只会制造更多的疼痛
<i>And life always makes more.</i>
