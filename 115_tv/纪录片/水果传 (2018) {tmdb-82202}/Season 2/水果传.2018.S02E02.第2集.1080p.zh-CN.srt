1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:06,760
Good evening. Welcome to the show.
The extra buttons.

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,120
Yeah.

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,760
What kind of a sicko, really,
would save these...

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,360
...have them in a huge file?

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,520
Drawers that wide.
You know, you just...

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,480
"Where the hell is that but..."

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,720
I mean, is it that hard to get
black, round buttons...

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,680
...that they make it
into a whole thing?

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,400
Like this is such a great jacket.

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,560
These buttons are so unique,
so one-of-a-kind.

11
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,040
You'll never find them.
We'll save you the trouble...

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,240
...of knocking your brains out.
We know they're going to fall off too.

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,960
That's the other point that
they're trying to make here.

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,560
Everyone in my family's creative.

15
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,840
And even though I'm working
as an accountant right now...

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,240
...I'd really like to eventually
work exclusively...

17
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,600
...on my papier-mache hats.

18
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,520
I don't understand.
Papier-mache hats?

19
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,960
What if it rains?

20
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,120
They're art.
You hang them on the wall.

21
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,760
Art.

22
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,280
It's my creative outlet,
one of my passions.

23
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,720
Any money in it?

24
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,960
"Who so belongs only to his age...

25
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,760
...reverences only its popinjays
and mumbo jumbos. "

26
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,960
Of course. Right.

27
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,640
-Thomas Carlyle, 1864.
-Tommy C.

28
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,840
These are the receipts from '85.

29
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,240
-And I'm gonna do '86.
-I'm sorry.

30
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,880
I thought it was a legitimate charity.
I didn't know you'd get audited.

31
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,240
I don't blame you. I blame myself.

32
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,640
-No, blame me.
-Okay, I blame you.

33
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,200
-No, no, don't blame me.
-What was I supposed to do?

34
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,920
I was on my first date with Elaine.

35
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,600
You come barging in here,
asking me to contribute money...

36
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,320
...to a volcano relief fund
for Krakatoa.

37
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,000
It was supposed to erupt.

38
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,800
I find the whole thing embarrassing.

39
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,960
Well, you know what
my feelings are about this.

40
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,320
I don't even pay taxes.

41
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,720
Yeah. That's easy when
you have no income.

42
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,760
-Hi.
-Hi.

43
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,200
Kramer, do me a favour, will you?

44
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,160
If you insist on making pasta
in my apartment...

45
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,440
...please don't put the tomato sauce
on the pasta while it's in the strainer.

46
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,040
All the little squares have
hardened red sauce in them.

47
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,840
What's so funny?

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,200
Oh, I don't know. Kramer dating
your roommate, it's funny.

49
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,200
It's a riot, Alice.

50
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,000
When do you put the sauce on?

51
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,720
Any other time.

52
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,520
No, no, no. I like to strain the sauce.

53
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,280
And I could really live without...

54
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,920
...the tribal music and the make-out
sessions in the living room.

55
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,480
Yeah, Tina likes the couch.

56
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,080
-What are you doing? What is all this?
-Oh, he's helping me sort my receipts.

57
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,640
I'm being audited.

58
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,960
You're being audited? What for?

59
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,360
Oh, I contributed money to a charity
that turned out to be fraudulent.

60
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,520
-It's really very boring.
-When was this?

61
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,920
A long, long time ago...

62
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,120
...in a galaxy far, far away.

63
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:29,360
I remember you donated to some
volcano thing on our first date.

64
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,800
Volcano? Really?

65
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,800
Oh, wait a minute.
Don't tell me that that was...

66
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,720
Something to drink?

67
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,680
What, did you think
that would impress me?

68
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,120
You've got me all wrong.

69
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,440
I was thinking only
of the poor Krakatoan.

70
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,560
Like you'd make this donation
for 50 bucks...

71
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,560
...and I'd start tearing my clothes off?

72
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,320
Those brave Krakatoans...

73
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,120
...east of Java...

74
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,360
...who sacrificed so much,
for so long.

75
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,160
Now you're being audited
because of it.

76
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,560
-See, that's karma.
-No, that's Kramer.

77
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,840
-So, what are you gonna do?
-It's all taken care of.

78
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,240
How is that?

79
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,760
An old friend of mine,
whom you may have met...

80
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,480
...George Costanza,
has recently become intimate...

81
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,000
...with a female accountant
who was formerly...

82
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,600
...a highly placed official
with a little outfit...

83
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,720
...known as the IRS.

84
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,800
And as we speak,
at this very moment...

85
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,240
...he is handing over to her
all of my pertinent tax information...

86
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,560
...and she has assured us...

87
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,960
...that the matter is well within
her field of expertise.

88
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,600
Why is she doing this?

89
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,680
I don't know. It must be love.

90
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,320
I don't think we should see
each other anymore.

91
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,440
You're great...

92
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,560
...but I'm riddled
with personal problems.

93
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,960
-What's wrong? What did I do?
-Nothing. It's not you.

94
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,920
It's me. I have a fear of commitment.

95
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,880
-I don't know how to love.
-You hate my earrings, don't you?

96
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,080
-No, no.
-And you didn't comment...

97
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,440
...on the chopsticks.

98
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,680
I love the chopsticks. I personally
prefer a fork, but they look very nice.

99
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,160
You're not telling me the truth.
I must have done something.

100
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,680
-I have a fear of intimacy. L...
-Don't give me cliches.

101
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,480
I have a right to know.
What did I do?

102
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,920
Nothing. It's not you.

103
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,440
I want the truth!

104
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,600
The truth? You want the truth?!

105
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,360
It is your earrings!

106
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,840
It is your chopsticks.

107
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,520
But it's so much more.
You're pretentious.

108
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,840
You call everyone by their full name.

109
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,400
You called my doorman Sammy,
"Samuel."

110
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,160
But you didn't even say Samuel.
You went "Samuel."

111
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,920
Papier-mache?

112
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,440
What is papier-mache?

113
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,960
Keep going.

114
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,360
I think I made my point.

115
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,400
I'm sorry if I was a little harsh.

116
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,440
No. I asked for the truth.

117
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,880
Thank you for being so honest.

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,440
Can I...?

119
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,320
-Can I walk you back to work?
-I really prefer to go alone.

120
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,160
How much do I owe?

121
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,720
Oh, please.

122
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,800
Four dollars is fine.

123
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,040
If this audit had happened to me and
I didn't have this woman to help me...

124
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,760
...I would've killed this man. I would've
strangled him with my bare hands.

125
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,880
-I don't blame you.
-Ever been through an audit?

126
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,640
-No.
-It's hell.

127
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,160
It's the financial equivalent
of a complete rectal examination.

128
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,000
I would've killed this man.

129
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,560
Torn him limb from limb.

130
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,760
Ripped the flesh right off his bones.

131
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,560
-Yeah?
-It's George.

132
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,000
Come on up.

133
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,320
There he is, the man himself...

134
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,280
...George Louis Costanza.

135
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,680
Here I am, about to go
to the electric chair...

136
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,400
...and my oldest friend
is dating the governor.

137
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,520
My whole life has been
a complete waste of time.

138
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,280
And there's so much more to go.

139
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,120
Now I know what I'm supposed
to do. It is so simple.

140
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,000
Tell the truth. That's all.
Just tell the truth.

141
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,360
-You give her my tax papers?
-What?

142
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,280
My papers?

143
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,040
What?

144
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,960
Oh, the papers.

145
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,640
-You didn't give her the papers?
-No, I did.

146
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,440
So?

147
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,360
I broke up with her.

148
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,320
-You what?
-I broke up with her.

149
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,920
I'm being audited...

150
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,640
-...and you broke up with her?
-It's okay. It's fine.

151
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,520
-She'll do it. I'm sure she'll still do it.
-Why? Why will she still do it?

152
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,840
She hates you now. People don't
do you favours after you dump them.

153
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,520
No, no. We left on good terms.

154
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,520
How is that possible?

155
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,000
Because l...
I told her the truth.

156
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,400
-Oh, my God.
-Okay.

157
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,680
-It's unheard of.
-She asked me to.

158
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,080
So you lie.

159
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,600
-What did you tell her?
-I told her that she was pretentious.

160
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,120
Pretentious?

161
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,760
The woman has my tax papers.
You told her she's pretentious?

162
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,320
The IRS...

163
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,760
...they're like the Mafia.
They take anything they want.

164
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,240
How would you like it if
someone told you the truth?

165
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,000
-What? What could they say?
-There are plenty of things to say.

166
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,480
Like what? I'm bald?
What is it specifically?

167
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,680
Is there an odour I'm not aware of?

168
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,920
-George, please.
-Give me one.

169
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,360
-You sure?
-Yes.

170
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,040
Okay.

171
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,160
You're extremely...

172
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,280
...careful with money.

173
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,440
I'm what?

174
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,680
-Forget it.
-I'm cheap? You think I'm cheap?!

175
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,240
How could you say that to me?
I can't believe this!

176
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,720
-How could you say that to me?
-You asked me to.

177
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,760
-You should've lied.
-So should you!

178
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,000
Okay, wait a second.
What happened to my papers?

179
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,680
-I'm not really working right now.
-I know.

180
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,640
When I was working, I spent, baby!

181
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,160
Yeah, I know.
Champagne, limos, cigars.

182
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,840
What happened to the papers?

183
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,360
She put them in her pocketbook.
I guess she took them.

184
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,520
-A pocketbook or a handbag?
-Is that relevant? She took them.

185
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,960
Call her office.

186
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,560
Give me the phone.

187
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,320
Yeah, hi, I'd like to speak to Patrice.

188
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,560
What?

189
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,280
Oh, really.

190
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,000
Oh, okay. Thank you.

191
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,440
What? What?

192
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,120
She never came back from lunch.

193
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,880
This is no good.

194
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,280
This is no good.

195
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,320
Call her house.

196
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,800
Hi. Are you okay?

197
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,800
No, no. No...

198
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,480
She hung up.

199
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,080
Not good.

200
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,960
All right, look,
there's nothing to be worried about.

201
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,160
She's just a little annoyed right now.

202
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,240
Tomorrow, I'll personally
go over there.

203
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,320
I'll apologize. I'll get the papers.

204
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,800
Don't worry. Don't worry.

205
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,200
Not good.

206
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,160
Yeah, it's a windshield.

207
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,120
I can see that. What's it for?

208
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,200
I found it on the road.

209
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,560
-Yeah?
-I just finished working out.

210
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,480
-Are you busy?
-No. Come on up.

211
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,840
Can you believe somebody
threw this out?

212
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,160
I'm gonna make a coffee table
out of this and surprise Tina.

213
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,480
Well, wouldn't it be invisible?

214
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,720
I mean, what, are you gonna just
sense it's in front of the couch?

215
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,920
Well...

216
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,080
Hello.

217
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,200
What's with you two?

218
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,080
-You haven't told him?
-Told me what?

219
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,640
Go ahead, tell him.

220
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,000
I saw her naked.

221
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,200
He saw me naked.

222
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,040
Kramer saw me naked.

223
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,840
Well, it was an accident.

224
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,800
Who walks into a woman's bedroom
without knocking? I wanna know.

225
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,120
I thought it was a closet.

226
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,880
Completely naked?

227
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,640
Completely naked.

228
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,680
Jerry, how can I go on?

229
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,360
All right, if it's gonna make you feel
any better, you can see me naked.

230
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,120
No, thank you.

231
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,040
-No, I want you to see me naked.
-No, no, no.

232
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,440
-I wanna show you.
-No! Jerry!

233
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,720
Hold it. Just a second.

234
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,040
Let's not lose our heads here.

235
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,880
Kramer, you know you're always
welcome in my home...

236
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,360
...but as far as Mr. Johnson
is concerned...

237
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,800
...that's another story.

238
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,480
-What is this?
-It's a windshield.

239
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,920
It's going to be
your new coffee table.

240
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,560
I'm gonna kill myself on that thing.
You can't even see it.

241
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,160
You'll sense it.

242
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,440
Well? What happened?
Was she there?

243
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,440
No. No, she wasn't.

244
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,840
-You didn't get my papers?
-No, I didn't.

245
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,120
Well, where is she?

246
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,560
A mental institution.

247
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,320
Why is it so difficult,
uncomfortable to be naked?

248
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,440
It's because we have clothes on...

249
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,080
...you can always make those little
adjustments, which people love to do.

250
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,400
You feel like you're getting it together.
"Yeah, I look pretty good.

251
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,680
Feeling good, looking good. "

252
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:10,040
But when you're naked, it's like...
It's so final. You're just, "Well...

253
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,000
...that's it.

254
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,120
There's nothing else I can do. "

255
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,200
That's why I like to wear
a belt when I'm naked.

256
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,960
Because I feel
it gives me something.

257
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,840
Some, you know,
"I'm naked, but, you know..."

258
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,320
I'd like to get pockets to hang
off of the belt. That would be...

259
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,320
Wouldn't that be the ultimate thing?

260
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,480
To be naked
and still be able to do this.

261
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,640
I think that would really help a lot.

262
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,120
A mental institution?

263
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,440
You know what they do in there?
Did you see Cuck oo's Nest?

264
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,920
They put those electrodes
in your head.

265
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,800
It's not really a mental institution.

266
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,600
It's more like a depression clinic.

267
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,120
She went out to Woodhaven and
checked herself in. I'm sick over this.

268
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,200
-Who told you this?
-Her roommate.

269
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,080
I've driven women
to lesbianism before...

270
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,120
...but never to a mental institution.

271
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,360
My friend Bob Sacamano
had shock treatments.

272
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,640
But his synapses were so large,
had no effect.

273
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,440
You know, I hate to raise
a crass financial concern...

274
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,240
...but was there any information
as to the whereabouts of my papers?

275
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,680
She put them in her pocketbook. She
probably took them out there with her.

276
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,960
-So, what now?
-I don't know.

277
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,320
Can we go out there?

278
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,720
-Where?
-Woodhaven.

279
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,240
We could.

280
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,640
I'm very nervous about this.

281
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,040
I've never spoken
to a mental patient before.

282
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,960
My cousin Douglas
was in a place like this one time.

283
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,720
Came over to my house for dinner,
there was no soda...

284
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,880
...and he went berserk.

285
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,680
He was screaming, "Where's
the Pepsi? Where's the Pepsi?"

286
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,320
I should be in a place like this.

287
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,680
I envy this woman.

288
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,600
Get to wear slippers all day.

289
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,000
Friends visit, they pity you.

290
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,800
Pity's very underrated. I like it.
It's good.

291
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,080
Plus, they give you those word-
association tests. I love those.

292
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,320
They're great.
There's no wrong answer.

293
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,120
-Potato.
-Tuberculosis.

294
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,080
-Blanket.
-Leroy.

295
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,160
-Grass.
-Tuberculosis.

296
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,640
Oh, boy. Here she comes.

297
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,080
Oh, my God.

298
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,640
Oh, Kram...

299
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,760
Kramer! Kramer, could you please...

300
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,360
...put something on?

301
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,720
Well... Oh, boy.

302
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,120
Listen, you want some leftovers?

303
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,400
I made some African food.
There's yambalas and sambusa.

304
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,480
Sweetie.

305
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,800
-Are you coming back to bed?
-Yeah, yeah. I'll be right there, babe.

306
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,320
Hi, Elaine.

307
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,680
What did you think
of the coffee table?

308
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,560
It's invisible.

309
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,000
So is everything cool or what?

310
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,680
Yeah, you seem
a little bit dysfunctional.

311
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,640
-Well...
-Come on, Elaine...

312
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,400
...just tell us the truth.

313
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,520
The truth?

314
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,120
You want the truth?

315
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,800
Who are you?

316
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,480
This is my friend...

317
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,360
...Jerry.

318
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,720
Why are you talking like that?

319
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,040
And what do you want?

320
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,600
Want? What could I possibly want?

321
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,880
I just came because I heard so many
nice things about you from George.

322
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,800
George thinks I'm pretentious.

323
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,960
Pretentious. Who isn't pretentious?
I mean...

324
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,800
...if everyone that was pretentious
was in a mental institution...

325
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,880
Obviously,
this isn't a mental institution.

326
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,680
You're trying to take it back because
you're feeling guilty I'm in here.

327
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,920
-No, that's not it at all.
-Don't lie, George!

328
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,200
I'm not a liar.

329
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,080
We're cool. Everything's cool.

330
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,640
-No problem. We're good.
-Just chatting.

331
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,120
Very friendly.

332
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,240
Alrighty.

333
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,000
No reason for us to raise our voices.

334
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,440
I know what you said.
You can't change that.

335
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,640
What I said.
I say stupid things all the time.

336
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,960
I can't go two minutes
without saying something dumb.

337
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,880
It's one stupid thing after another.

338
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,600
So let me ask you, when you come
to one of these places...

339
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,400
...do you bring your pocketbook?

340
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,880
You should be the one criticizing me.

341
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,560
I'm lucky to even know
someone like you.

342
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,640
-Do you mean that?
-Of course.

343
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,280
-I'm incapable of guile.
-He's never guiled.

344
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,120
You know, some women keep a lot of
important papers in their pocketbooks.

345
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,160
Like, for example...

346
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,280
...someone else's
personal financial papers.

347
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,720
Papers.

348
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,760
Oh, Jerry. You're the Jerome
with the tax problem.

349
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,600
You know,
after that date with George...

350
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,400
...I got so cuckoo,
I threw out all your papers.

351
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,960
So I'd love to help you,
but I'll just need the copies.

352
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,320
There are no copies.

353
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,600
So...

354
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,200
...are you saying you want
to continue seeing me?

355
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,680
Who makes copies?

356
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,280
The truth is...

357
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,520
...I think...

358
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,560
...you make a very nice couple.

359
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,720
Oh, Kramer.

360
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,320
-Here, Kramer?
-No, no.

361
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,560
Let's go to the couch.

362
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,160
Yes, I'm trying to get
a copy of a receipt...

363
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,360
...for a computer that I bought there.

364
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,320
It was 1987.

365
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,800
I remember I talked to a guy,
had, like, a maroon sport jacket...

366
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,640
...and he might have had a toupee.
Oh, it was a weave?

367
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,680
Okay, well, then I'll come by.

368
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,080
Okay, bye.

369
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,960
Anybody want to take a walk down
to 48th Street?

370
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,480
I think I may have tracked
down another receipt.

371
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,680
I can't. I got to go visit Tina
in the hospital.

372
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,840
-George?
-I'm going to a poetry reading...

373
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,240
...with Patrice.

374
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,320
First-time poets.

375
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,400
It's in a burnt-out building
down by the docks.

376
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,720
It's supposed to be good.

377
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,920
Are you going to the hospital now?

378
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,600
-Yeah, I suppose I am.
-All right. Great, great.

379
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,920
We'll share a cab.

380
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,800
You going by 48th.
You can give me a ride.

381
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,240
I'm getting in on that.

382
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,200
-Yeah.
-You know you're chipping in.

383
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,360
You're going that way anyway!

384
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,320
Come on.

385
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,960
I was audited last year.
I have been through an audit.

386
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,040
At first, I thought, "Well,
IRS kind of sounds like Toys 'R' Us.

387
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,280
Maybe it won't be so bad. Maybe they
have a sense of fun about it. "

388
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,040
You know?
But it's bad. It's an ordeal.

389
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,920
And they don't do anything
to keep your spirits up...

390
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,640
...through the ordeal.

391
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,480
I think they should take all
your receipts and put them...

392
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,760
...in one of those big,
Lucite sweepstake drums...

393
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,680
...and just kind of crank
it around there.

394
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,080
Give you a feeling like you might win
something. You know what I mean?

395
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,960
Then they can pull them out and go:

396
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,720
"Oh, I'm sorry.
That's another illegal deduction...

397
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,680
...but we do have some lovely
parting gifts for you. Jail. "
