却克服不了内心的阴暗

你打算什么时候把真相告诉佩吉

你来除掉它
You're going to get rid of it.

50
00:03:06,866 --> 00:03:10,535
好好想想 这是你的难题 露丝
Think again. This is your problem, Ruth.

51
00:03:12,973 --> 00:03:15,539
- 你卖了多少法术了 - 你不会的
- How many spells have you sold? - You wouldn't.

女巫协会会毁了你的护身符的
The Coven will crush your talisman.

53

你会被剥夺一切

你要告诉大家这是一个死胎
You're going to tell the Coven that it was a stillborn.

But first...

56
00:03:23,984 --> 00:03:26,317
你要来解决一下我的错误
you're going to get rid of my mistake.

57

你想让我干什么

58
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,162
你知道你该怎么做

我在哪
Where am I?

63
00:05:13,274 --> 00:05:15,040
你还好吗
You all right?

64
00:05:15,042 --> 00:05:17,076
他们给我注射了别人的血液
They injected me with someone's blood.

65
00:05:17,078 --> 00:05:18,844
他们给你注射了埃琳娜的血液吗
Did they inject you with Elena's blood?

66
00:05:18,846 --> 00:05:20,912
那会让我变成狼吗
Would that turn me into a wolf?

67
00:05:20,914 --> 00:05:22,982
我见到过她 罗根
I saw her, Logan!

68
00:05:22,984 --> 00:05:25,017
他逼我看埃琳娜
He forced me to watch Elena.

69
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:26,585
她变成了狼
She became a wolf!

70
00:05:26,587 --> 00:05:28,515
我可以跑掉 但是回头来找你了 
I could've run but I came back for you, 

71
00:05:28,516 --> 00:05:29,487
所以请说实话
so just be honest!

72
00:05:31,223 --> 00:05:33,725
你是他们其中之一 是吗
You're one of them, aren't you.

73
00:05:33,727 --> 00:05:34,901
宝贝 听着 我不知道
Baby, listen. I don't know 

74
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:36,194
他们给你注射了什么毒药
what kind of drugs they gave you...

75
00:05:36,196 --> 00:05:39,197
别说谎 我应该更好的 我应该知道真相
Don't lie. I deserve better. I deserve the truth.

76
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,523
我一开始就该知道 
I deserved it from the beginning. 

77
00:05:40,524 --> 00:05:41,700
我们在一起两年了
Two years we were together!

78
00:05:41,702 --> 00:05:44,402
两年来 我爱你
Two years that I loved you,

79
00:05:44,404 --> 00:05:47,505
而且这两年你也爱着我
and it's two years that you loved me back.

80
00:05:51,676 --> 00:05:53,711
孩子呢
And the baby?

81
00:05:53,713 --> 00:05:55,513
我怀着的是什么
What am I pregnant with?

82
00:05:57,082 --> 00:05:59,583
听着 我们的孩子会有好多年
Listen, our child will have plenty of years

83
00:05:59,585 --> 00:06:03,120
- 都很正常... - 正常
- of being normal before... - Normal?

84
00:06:03,122 --> 00:06:04,622
然后呢
And then what?

85
00:06:04,624 --> 00:06:08,492
然后他就会和他爸一样
And then he becomes like his father.

86
00:06:08,494 --> 00:06:10,694
成为狼人
A werewolf.

87
00:06:10,696 --> 00:06:12,462
你为什么没给我说过
Why didn't you tell me?

88
00:06:12,464 --> 00:06:14,097
我该怎么向你解释
How am I going to explain that to you

89
00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:15,699
能让你觉得我没疯
without you thinking I'm insane?

90
00:06:15,701 --> 00:06:19,369
我该怎么给其他人说 你让我怎么做
How do I tell anybody that? What would you have me do?

91
00:06:20,805 --> 00:06:24,174
我们要离开这
We're going to get out of here.

92
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:25,475
离开这儿以后
And when we do,

93
00:06:25,477 --> 00:06:28,145
我不希望再见到你
I want you to walk away from me.

94
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:42,158
- 再试一次 - 我不行
- One more try. - I can't.

95
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,060
手放在上面
Picture your hand on top.

96
00:06:44,062 --> 00:06:45,728
手掌在球上方慢慢感受
Feel the cool metal on your palm.

97
00:06:47,531 --> 00:06:49,331
闭上眼
Close your eyes.

98
00:06:58,641 --> 00:07:00,742
噢我做不到 对不起
Oh, I can't, I'm sorry.

99
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,317
这是一种伟大而古老的力量
This is a great and ancient power

100
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:11,086
我们生来就有
you and I possess.

101
00:07:11,088 --> 00:07:13,989
没有护身符我没办法获得巫力
Without the talisman, I can't connect to the Coven.

102
00:07:13,991 --> 00:07:16,224
很长时间来 我也没有护身符
For the longest time, I didn't have one either.

103
00:07:16,226 --> 00:07:19,260
但我坚持下来了 你也可以
I survived. So will you.

104
00:07:19,262 --> 00:07:21,463
这是你们巫师团控制你的另一种方式
It's another way for your Coven to control you.

105
00:07:23,432 --> 00:07:24,799
她们爱我
They love me.

106
00:07:27,035 --> 00:07:28,869
埃琳娜也这么说
Elena even said so.

107
00:07:32,274 --> 00:07:33,841
我是锁
I am the lock.

108
00:07:33,843 --> 00:07:35,477
我就是钥匙
And I am the key.

109
00:07:37,314 --> 00:07:39,080
很好
Good.

110
00:07:39,082 --> 00:07:41,148
那你为什么心烦意乱
Then why are you distracted?

111
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:43,283
埃琳娜还好吗
Is Elena okay?

112
00:07:43,285 --> 00:07:44,986
为什么这么说
What makes you think she isn't?

113
00:07:44,988 --> 00:07:48,355
我能感觉到她 她不太好
I can just... feel her. Something's not right.

114
00:07:48,357 --> 00:07:52,192
我不想她出事
I don't want anything bad to happen to her.

115
00:07:52,194 --> 00:07:55,129
埃琳娜对你没有影响
Elena has no influence on you.

116
00:07:55,131 --> 00:07:56,568
你会忘了她说的话 
You will forget what she said. 

117
00:07:56,569 --> 00:07:58,165
她不会出现在你脑海中
She is no longer in your mind.

118
00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:01,401
她们想控制我
They want to control me.

119
00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:19,418
你要是把床弄塌了
If you tear your bed apart,

120
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,221
就只能睡地板了
you'll just have to sleep on the floor.

121
00:08:22,223 --> 00:08:24,223
你在意什么
What do you care?

122
00:08:24,225 --> 00:08:26,026
什么也没有
I don't.

123
00:08:26,028 --> 00:08:27,994
但萨凡纳是个心思敏感孩子
But Savannah is a sensitive girl.

124
00:08:29,329 --> 00:08:32,298
因为某些原因 她越来越依赖你
And for some reason she's grown attached to you.

125
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,267
她总能感受到你在身边
She can feel you from across the compound

126
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:37,470
我希望她集中精神
and I need her to concentrate.

127
00:08:37,472 --> 00:08:38,771
你有什么目的
For what?

128
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,775
毁灭
The Undoing.

129
00:08:42,777 --> 00:08:44,544
我希望她平静下来
I want her to be calm

130
00:08:44,546 --> 00:08:47,245
这就要求你必须先平静下来
which requires you to be calm.

131
00:08:47,247 --> 00:08:50,749
你要失控了
You're losing control.

132
00:08:50,751 --> 00:08:52,384
如果她能感受到我
If she can sense me,

133
00:08:52,386 --> 00:08:55,154
那她就知道 我是不会让你成功的
then she knows that I won't let you go through with it.

134
00:09:10,604 --> 00:09:13,705
你们狼人真是个
You werewolves are such an...

135
00:09:13,707 --> 00:09:15,574
有趣的物种
interesting species.

136
00:09:18,011 --> 00:09:20,344
哪种咒语下在你身上有用哪种没用
I wish I could spend more time figuring out

137
00:09:20,346 --> 00:09:23,547
有时间的话真想让你尝个遍
which spells work on you and which don't.

138
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,055
最强大的狼人
The most powerful werewolf...

139
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,658
我不是最强大的
I'm not the most powerful.

140
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:38,028
要不是有人让我看到了 我都不知自己多强大
I didn't know how powerful I was until someone showed me.

141
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:41,365
世间唯一的男巫
The only male witch.

142
00:09:41,367 --> 00:09:45,135
与唯一的狼女
The only female werewolf.

143
00:09:45,137 --> 00:09:47,705
我们有很多地方是一样的
We have so much in common.

144
00:09:47,707 --> 00:09:50,241
我们一点都不一样
We have nothing in common.

145
00:09:56,313 --> 00:10:00,050
我想知道什么才能摧毁你
I wonder what it would take to break you?

146
00:10:00,052 --> 00:10:03,820
也许你需要自我突破
Maybe you need to break yourself.

147
00:10:06,225 --> 00:10:08,591
九界
Novem tibi orbibus.

148
00:10:15,466 --> 00:10:17,267
很快就结束了
It will all soon be over.

149
00:10:25,408 --> 00:10:27,143
好好享受
Enjoy your day.

150
00:10:52,003 --> 00:10:54,743
魁北克省东方镇

151
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:10,584
森林面积三千英亩 有十条通路
There are 3,000 acres of forest and 10 access roads.

152
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:14,054
就是狼也没法及时搜索全面
Even as a wolf I couldn't search all this in time.

153
00:11:14,056 --> 00:11:16,256
我们得找些当地人 也许他们知道它在哪儿
We can find some locals. Maybe they know where it is.

154
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,891
最近的小镇离这儿二十英里
The nearest town is 20 miles away.

155
00:11:17,893 --> 00:11:20,194
我觉得 我们快来不及了
We're running out of time, I can feel it.

156
00:11:20,196 --> 00:11:21,252
萨凡纳已经成年了
Savannah's passed into womanhood, 

157
00:11:21,253 --> 00:11:22,496
就像空气中的静电
it's like static electricity in the air.

158
00:11:22,498 --> 00:11:24,465
你能顺着找到她吗
Can you follow it to her?

159
00:11:24,467 --> 00:11:26,266
就像追逐一场雷暴
That would be like chasing a thunderstorm.

160
00:12:17,752 --> 00:12:19,352
不会再来一次吧
Not again.

161
00:12:19,354 --> 00:12:20,462
有事情发生了 
Something's happening. 

162
00:12:20,463 --> 00:12:21,887
另一场仪式要开始了
There's going to be another ritual.

163
00:12:23,556 --> 00:12:26,358
一定有法子离开这里
There's got to be some kind of way to get out of here.

164
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,194
万一我们就是祭品呢
What if we're the ritual?

165
00:12:29,196 --> 00:12:29,872
什么 
Wh... Like what? 

166
00:12:29,873 --> 00:12:31,630
他们在我身上做了全部测试
All the tests they've been doing on me.

167
00:12:31,632 --> 00:12:33,965
他们不在乎我 他们关心的是孩子
They don't care about me, it's the baby they're after!

168
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:35,667
罗根 万一他们想拿走他怎么办
Logan, what if they want to take him?

169
00:12:35,669 --> 00:12:37,568
喂 看着我 这是不会发生的好吗
Hey. Look at me. That's not going to happen, all right?

170
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,304
我没在开玩笑 我要疯了
I'm not joking, I'm losing my mind.

171
00:12:39,306 --> 00:12:41,273
我不想死在这
I don't want to die down here.

172
00:12:41,275 --> 00:12:44,175
那是什么
What's that?

173
00:12:44,177 --> 00:12:45,977
我猜是割到电线了
Guess I clipped a wire.

174
00:12:45,979 --> 00:12:47,512
嘘
Sh...

175
00:12:47,514 --> 00:12:49,547
天呐
Oh, god...

176
00:15:27,966 --> 00:15:30,006
你们巫师能和自然沟通
You witches with your talk of communing with nature,

177
00:15:30,008 --> 00:15:31,978
难道不知道别穿高跟鞋进森林吗
you don't know enough not to wear heels in the forest.

178
00:15:32,002 --> 00:15:33,334
我哪里有时间
It's not like I had time

179
00:15:33,336 --> 00:15:34,736
去鞋店买鞋
to stop at a shoe store.

180
00:15:35,905 --> 00:15:37,439
知道吗 我们面对的是更糟的事
We have worse to face too, you know,

181
00:15:37,441 --> 00:15:39,274
比如我们会不会死
like whether or not we're all going to die.

182
00:15:39,276 --> 00:15:40,943
你别想拖累我
You're not going to slow me down.

183
00:15:40,945 --> 00:15:42,310
我不会等你的
I'm not stopping.

184
00:15:42,312 --> 00:15:43,845
我得找到埃琳娜
I'm going to find Elena.

185
00:15:43,847 --> 00:15:45,680
别傻了 你需要我在你身边
Don't be such a meathead. You need me with you.

186
00:15:45,682 --> 00:15:47,748
我只需要埃琳娜给我信号
Elena will signal. That is all I need.

187
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,150
如果她没法给我们信号呢
What if she can't signal us?

188
00:15:49,152 --> 00:15:50,651
她会给的
She will!

189
00:15:50,653 --> 00:15:52,087
你对她有信心 这很好
You know, your confidence in her is really sweet,

190
00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:53,654
但是 万一呢
but still. What if.

191
00:15:56,325 --> 00:15:58,393
只要我们离使用魔法的人够近
Anyone who uses magic, if we're close enough,

192
00:15:58,395 --> 00:16:01,261
通过这个我就能找出他们
I can spot them with this.

193
00:16:01,263 --> 00:16:03,297
你需要我在你身边
You need me with you.

194
00:16:05,934 --> 00:16:08,636
跟上我否则我就拽着你的头发上路
Keep up or I drag you by the hair.

195
00:16:08,638 --> 00:16:10,404
我没法呼吸了
I can't breathe.

196
00:16:10,406 --> 00:16:11,939
贴着门上的那个孔
Stay close to the holes in the door.

197
00:16:20,749 --> 00:16:22,282
快脱掉你的胸罩
Your bra. Take it off!

198
00:16:22,284 --> 00:16:23,450
你开什么玩笑
You kidding me?

199
00:16:23,452 --> 00:16:24,918
- 快 - 你搞什么鬼
- Come on. - What are you doing?

200
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,220
我需要你胸罩里的铁丝 快给我
I need the wire! The wire in your bra, give it to me.

201
00:16:26,222 --> 00:16:27,554
我们会逃出去的
We're going to get out of here.

202
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:43,670
埃琳娜
Elena.

203
00:16:45,006 --> 00:16:47,674
亲爱的你安全了 我在你身边
I'm here, darling. You're safe.

204
00:16:47,676 --> 00:16:49,509
克莱 你怎么找到我的
Clay, how did you find me?

205
00:16:49,511 --> 00:16:51,477
无论你去世界上的哪个地方
There's no place in this world you can go

206
00:16:51,479 --> 00:16:52,878
我都能找到你
where I won't find you.

207
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:56,849
杰里米还有其他人呢
Where are the others? Jeremy?

208
00:16:56,851 --> 00:16:59,218
这里只有我们
It's just us.

209
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,553
我和你
You and me.

210
00:17:00,555 --> 00:17:03,189
就像注定的那样
The way it's supposed to be.

211
00:17:03,191 --> 00:17:04,490
我得走了...
I have to go...

212
00:17:04,492 --> 00:17:06,159
别 别
No, no.

213
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,994
自我第一次见你 我就知道...
The first time I saw you...

214
00:17:11,665 --> 00:17:14,166
我的所有一切都属于你
I knew every part of me belonged to you.

215
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:19,304
克莱...
Clay...

216
00:17:19,306 --> 00:17:22,808
我咬你是为了给你我的一切
I bit you so you could have it all.

217
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:28,304
快啊...
Come on...

218
00:18:37,014 --> 00:18:38,214
你能走吗
Can you walk?

219
00:18:38,216 --> 00:18:40,383
- 我还跑的动 - 那就好
- I can run. - All right.

220
00:18:43,454 --> 00:18:44,621
你看到什么东西了吗
Did you see anything?

221
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,055
可能吧 我看到东边有闪光
Maybe. I saw a glint in the east,

222
00:18:46,057 --> 00:18:47,322
就在森林的深处
deeper into the forest.

223
00:18:47,324 --> 00:18:48,724
但是一晃就不见了
But it was quick and then it was gone.

224
00:18:48,726 --> 00:18:49,925
是魔法吗
Was it magic?

225
00:18:49,927 --> 00:18:51,193
反正绝对不寻常
Oh, it was something.

226
00:18:51,195 --> 00:18:52,361
告诉我准确的地点
Tell me exactly where.

227
00:18:52,363 --> 00:18:53,629
告诉你干吗 你能干什么
Why, what are you going to do?

228
00:18:53,631 --> 00:18:54,864
像猎狗一样跑来跑去
Run around like a bloodhound

229
00:18:54,866 --> 00:18:56,298
到处乱嗅吗
sniffing for who-knows-what?

230
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,733
态度敢不敢再差一点
I don't think your attitude's very cute.

231
00:18:57,735 --> 00:18:59,568
留些暴脾气给尼克吧
Save it for Nick.

232
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:02,471
我的意思是 我们二十分钟内就能赶到那里
I'm saying that we can make it there in 20 minutes.

233
00:19:02,473 --> 00:19:04,839
我能看到魔力 就意味着有进入的通道
I saw power lines, which means an access road.

234
00:19:04,841 --> 00:19:06,341
我能在地图找出它来
I can find it on the map.

235
00:19:20,489 --> 00:19:21,790
感觉怎么样
What do you think?

236
00:19:24,093 --> 00:19:26,294
我从没有过...
I've never had...

237
00:19:26,296 --> 00:19:28,096
任何...
anything...

238
00:19:28,098 --> 00:19:29,430
这么美的东西
like this before.

239
00:19:30,332 --> 00:19:31,766
也该是时候了
Well, isn't it time?

240
00:19:32,868 --> 00:19:34,602
所有东西都准备好了
Everything is ready.

241
00:19:35,771 --> 00:19:36,937
所有人也都到了
Everyone is here

242
00:19:36,939 --> 00:19:39,239
只为了给你庆祝 萨凡纳
to celebrate you, Savannah.

243
00:19:39,241 --> 00:19:40,941
今天
Today,

244
00:19:40,943 --> 00:19:42,743
你能掌控你的能力
you can use your powers.

245
00:19:42,745 --> 00:19:46,146
今天就是毁灭的日子
Today is the day of the Undoing.

246
00:19:46,148 --> 00:19:48,683
我希望埃琳娜能看到这些
I wish Elena could see it.

247
00:20:02,898 --> 00:20:04,164
萨凡纳
Savannah!

248
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,326
戴安
Diane?

249
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:41,800
我哥哥
My brother,

250
00:20:41,802 --> 00:20:44,102
他因你而死
he's dead because of you!

251
00:20:45,338 --> 00:20:48,273
如今我也将步他的后尘
And now so am I.

252
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,114
我一定要找你报仇
I am coming for you.

253
00:21:27,312 --> 00:21:29,514
这一切...
You...

254
00:21:29,516 --> 00:21:32,616
是你造成的 埃琳娜
did this, Elena.

255
00:21:32,618 --> 00:21:34,484
你会付出代价的
And you will pay!

256
00:21:38,322 --> 00:21:40,690
这一切是你造成的 埃琳娜
You did this, Elena!

257
00:21:40,692 --> 00:21:43,727
你会付出代价的
And you will pay!

258
00:21:43,729 --> 00:21:46,530
你会付出代价的
You will pay!

259
00:21:46,532 --> 00:21:47,798
你会付出代价的
You will pay.

260
00:21:49,066 --> 00:21:52,235
你会... 付出... 代价
You... will... pay!

261
00:22:26,535 --> 00:22:28,001
看这里
Over here.

262
00:23:13,314 --> 00:23:15,181
萨凡纳
Savannah?

263
00:23:15,183 --> 00:23:16,648
埃琳娜 你还好吗
Elena, are you okay?

264
00:23:17,584 --> 00:23:19,318
我怎么知道你是真的
How do I know you're real?

265
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,453
什么意思
What do you mean?

266
00:23:21,455 --> 00:23:24,957
我当然是... 真的
Okay, of course I'm... real.

267
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:26,325
我感觉到你有麻烦
I felt you were in trouble.

268
00:23:26,327 --> 00:23:27,860
我就从亚雷斯塔那跑出来了
I got away from Aleister.

269
00:23:27,862 --> 00:23:29,795
他对我动了手脚
He did something to me.

270
00:23:31,898 --> 00:23:34,099
搅乱我的神智
Messing with my mind.

271
00:23:34,101 --> 00:23:35,734
我知道
I know.

272
00:23:35,736 --> 00:23:38,203
我们要离开这里
We need to get out of here.

273
00:23:38,205 --> 00:23:40,472
跟着我 我 我知道怎么走
Follow me, I... I know the way.

274
00:23:53,819 --> 00:23:55,686
杰里米说他们发现两百英里外的另一个
Jeremy said they found the other military base

275
00:23:55,688 --> 00:23:57,555
军事基地 那里什么都没有
200 miles away. There's nothing there.

276
00:23:57,557 --> 00:24:00,125
大楼紧锁 场地封闭了好些年 
Buildings have been knocked to the ground years ago.

277
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:01,592
这里太安静了
It's quiet.

278
00:24:02,861 --> 00:24:04,662
一定是在这附近某个地方
It's got to be somewhere around here.

279
00:24:04,664 --> 00:24:07,698
秘密军事基地不可能这么简单就被找到
Hidden military bases aren't supposed to be easy to find.

280
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,300
如果我可以 我去做
If I could, I would,

281
00:24:09,302 --> 00:24:10,367
但我不能四处飞着找
but I can't fly around 

282
00:24:10,368 --> 00:24:11,669
有红屋顶和薰衣草的地方
looking for red roofs and lavender.

283
00:24:11,671 --> 00:24:13,638
总之 我们要找的是什么类型的信号
What type of signal are we looking for, anyway?

284
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,172
不管是什么类型的 越明显越好找
Whatever it is, it better be big.

285
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:20,510
我等不下去了
I can't take the waiting.

286
00:24:20,512 --> 00:24:22,612
你真的很爱她 是吧
You really do love her, don't you.

287
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,318
比你想的还要爱
More than you can imagine.

288
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,188
我小时候就被教导要学会怎样独处
When I was a little girl, I was taught how to be alone.

289
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:33,523
怎样形影相吊 怎样自娱自乐
How to stay alone, how to be happy alone.

290
00:24:33,525 --> 00:24:34,992
我曾经也是这样
I thought that way, once.

291
00:24:36,194 --> 00:24:37,994
现在不是了
Not anymore.

292
00:24:37,996 --> 00:24:39,996
我十三岁时 有个男孩
There was a boy, when I was 13.

293
00:24:39,998 --> 00:24:41,431
他和我同住一条街
He lived on my street.

294
00:24:41,433 --> 00:24:42,866
他叫杰夫
His name was Jeff.

295
00:24:44,836 --> 00:24:47,971
还有比这个更无聊的名字了吗 "杰夫"
Is there a more boring name than that? "Jeff"?

296
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,240
他总是很安静
He was quiet.

297
00:24:51,242 --> 00:24:53,776
害羞
Shy.

298
00:24:53,778 --> 00:24:55,811
从不敢跟我说一句话
Never really said a word to me.

299
00:24:55,813 --> 00:24:57,213
有一天
And then one day

300
00:24:57,215 --> 00:24:58,814
我在信箱里找到绑头发的发带
I found this ribbon for my hair in the mailbox.

301
00:24:58,816 --> 00:25:01,584
接下来又有另一个发带 之后每个星期都有
And then another one, and then one every single week.

302
00:25:02,886 --> 00:25:04,920
发带很漂亮
They were beautiful ribbons.

303
00:25:04,922 --> 00:25:06,990
然后我绑上这些发带走在街上
And I'd wear them and I'd walk down the street

304
00:25:06,992 --> 00:25:11,760
我看到杰夫对我微笑
and I would see Jeff and he'd be smiling at me.

305
00:25:11,762 --> 00:25:13,395
我觉得我要疯了
And then I felt like I was going crazy

306
00:25:13,397 --> 00:25:15,631
因为这只让我想到
'cause all I could think about was the...

307
00:25:15,633 --> 00:25:16,999
无聊的小子
boring kid.

308
00:25:17,001 --> 00:25:18,734
在无聊的街上
On the boring street.

309
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:24,740
之后我拿到了这个
And then I got this.

310
00:25:26,209 --> 00:25:27,876
做了个女巫
Became a witch.

311
00:25:29,145 --> 00:25:30,612
再没有时间跟愿意
Didn't have any more time for boys

312
00:25:30,614 --> 00:25:32,714
给我买发带的男生一起
who wanted to buy me ribbons for my hair.

313
00:25:34,517 --> 00:25:36,718
我自己选择的
I made a choice.

314
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,420
该来的总会来
When it happens,

315
00:25:38,422 --> 00:25:40,955
你也别无选择
you don't get a choice.

316
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:42,724
你不会再孤单了
You never want to be alone again.

317
00:25:44,259 --> 00:25:45,693
我有我妈
I have my mother.

318
00:25:45,695 --> 00:25:47,328
女巫团
My Coven.

319
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:48,763
我一点都不孤单
I am not alone.

320
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,034
走吧 罗密欧 
Let's get going, Romeo.

321
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,240
我们会找到她的
We will find her.

322
00:26:05,347 --> 00:26:06,980
我们为什么会在这
Why are we here?

323
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,282
你在做什么
What are you doing?

324
00:26:10,785 --> 00:26:12,753
这不是出去的路
This isn't the way out of here.

325
00:26:14,122 --> 00:26:16,222
有东西要你看看
You need to see something.

326
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:42,282
不 不
No... No...

327
00:26:42,284 --> 00:26:44,350
这不可能
That's not possible.

328
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,286
这不可能
That's not possible.

329
00:26:48,722 --> 00:26:50,856
一切都是假的
Nothing's real.

330
00:26:50,858 --> 00:26:54,026
你还是困在牢笼里
You're still in your cell.

331
00:26:55,997 --> 00:26:57,930
幻觉
Hallucinating.

332
00:26:57,932 --> 00:27:01,100
你发不出信号给你的朋友
You can't signal your friends.

333
00:27:01,102 --> 00:27:02,902
我知道我是真实的
I know I'm real.

334
00:27:02,904 --> 00:27:04,303
你骗我
You lied to me.

335
00:27:04,305 --> 00:27:06,972
你从来没有打算要帮我
You were never going to help me.

336
00:27:06,974 --> 00:27:08,574
你只想着要逃出这里
You just wanted to get out.

337
00:27:08,576 --> 00:27:09,774
不
No...

338
00:27:09,776 --> 00:27:13,212
你只在乎你自己 埃琳娜
You only care about yourself, Elena.

339
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:15,214
逃不出自己的掌心
Can't escape your own mind.

340
00:27:17,617 --> 00:27:19,151
自私
Selfish!

341
00:27:19,153 --> 00:27:21,786
他们都会因你而死
They're all going to die because of you.

342
00:27:21,788 --> 00:27:23,722
因你而死
For you.

343
00:27:23,724 --> 00:27:25,156
求求你
Please...

344
00:27:25,158 --> 00:27:26,591
别
Stop...

345
00:27:27,728 --> 00:27:29,628
你就是个怪物
You are a monster!

346
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:33,131
你就该这样
And you deserve to suffer for it!

347
00:27:34,734 --> 00:27:37,502
你就呆在这里
You are going to stay here...

348
00:27:40,372 --> 00:27:42,006
永远
forever.

349
00:28:15,565 --> 00:28:17,800
慢着 他们离开草坪了
Wait. They're heading out to the field.

350
00:28:17,802 --> 00:28:19,101
我们得从树林那边穿过去
We have to go through the woods.

351
00:28:19,103 --> 00:28:20,502
哦 不 不 不 我们不能走太远
Oh, no no no, we're not going to get far

352
00:28:20,504 --> 00:28:22,504
如果这些鬼东西又开始沸腾起来
if these things start heating up again.

353
00:28:22,506 --> 00:28:23,839
我们可以让他们停止行动
We can disable them.

354
00:28:23,841 --> 00:28:25,273
这个不可见的封印
The entire invisible perimeter.

355
00:28:25,275 --> 00:28:26,875
我们得去亚雷斯塔的房间
We have to get to Aleister's quarters.

356
00:28:26,877 --> 00:28:28,510
在院子的另一边
It's on the other side of the compound.

357
00:28:28,512 --> 00:28:29,811
我们走
Let's go.

358
00:28:39,154 --> 00:28:41,590
埃琳娜 我们要做的只有离开
Elena. All we have to do is walk away

359
00:28:41,592 --> 00:28:43,191
一切都会好起来的
and everything will be all right.

360
00:28:45,428 --> 00:28:47,428
那里面有什么
What's down there?

361
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:49,530
安详
Peace.

362
00:28:49,532 --> 00:28:51,365
你所寻找的安详
The peace you're looking for.

363
00:29:00,042 --> 00:29:02,110
我辜负了萨凡纳
I failed Savannah.

364
00:29:04,546 --> 00:29:06,447
我答应过要保护她
I promised I'd protect her.

365
00:29:07,382 --> 00:29:08,682
跟我走吧
Come with me.

366
00:29:11,353 --> 00:29:13,487
这都是为你好
It's for your own good.

367
00:29:13,489 --> 00:29:15,422
你可以放下这一切
You can let it all go.

368
00:29:15,424 --> 00:29:16,657
不
No.

369
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,160
我不想就这样一走了之
I don't want to let it go.

370
00:29:22,196 --> 00:29:24,197
这不是我想要的
That's not what I want.

371
00:29:24,199 --> 00:29:25,866
那你想要什么
Then what do you want?

372
00:29:30,304 --> 00:29:31,537
爱
Love.

373
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,708
爱
Love?

374
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:38,210
到最后 这才是最重要的
In the end, it's all that matters.

375
00:29:39,813 --> 00:29:42,214
这才是关键
It is the key.

376
00:29:47,421 --> 00:29:49,422
我们不是怪物
We're not monsters.

377
00:29:51,057 --> 00:29:54,493
因为我们...
Because we...

378
00:29:54,495 --> 00:29:56,796
我们能相爱
we can love?

379
00:29:56,798 --> 00:29:58,330
你现在只能靠自己了
You're on your way back, now.

380
00:30:02,602 --> 00:30:04,736
你会用到那些 亲爱的
You're going to need those, darling.

381
00:30:05,872 --> 00:30:08,507
出去外面 向我示意
Get outside. Signal me.

382
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,528
...我们的信仰
...the one true path.

383
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:35,066
他是一道即将指引我们走向毁灭的光芒
He is the light that will guide us to the Undoing.

384
00:30:35,068 --> 00:30:37,936
他是我们的信仰
He is the one true path.

385
00:30:37,938 --> 00:30:42,072
他是一道即将指引我们走向毁灭的光芒
He is the light that will guide us to the Undoing.

386
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:48,379
向依然在我们心中的两位鞠躬
Bow before the two who shall remain.

387
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:54,719
聚集力量
Gather the power.

388
00:31:37,427 --> 00:31:39,028
...毁灭
...the Undoing.

389
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,197
他是我们的信仰
He is the one true path.

390
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:44,767
他是一道即将指引我们走向毁灭的光芒
He is the light that will guide us to the Undoing.

391
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:46,769
他是我们的信仰
He is the one true path.

392
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:50,406
他是一道即将指引我们走向毁灭的光芒...
He is the light that will guide us to the Undoing...

393
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,274
停下
Stop!

394
00:31:55,177 --> 00:31:56,645
给我那女孩
Give me the girl!

395
00:31:56,647 --> 00:31:57,979
埃琳娜
Elena.

396
00:31:57,981 --> 00:31:59,648
我要萨凡纳
I want Savannah.

397
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:00,883
现在
Now!

398
00:32:11,661 --> 00:32:13,261
那不像是个仪式
Okay, that did not sound like a ritual.

399
00:32:13,263 --> 00:32:16,298
我不在乎 赶紧离开这吧
I don't care. Let's just get out of here.

400
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,800
看 这就是能量所标记的东西
There. That's what powers these marks.

401
00:32:23,071 --> 00:32:25,573
你应该提醒我
You know, you could've warned me.

402
00:32:25,575 --> 00:32:28,509
瑞秋... 我爱你
Rachel... I love you.

403
00:32:28,511 --> 00:32:29,327
好吧 对不起 
All right? And I'm sorry, 

404
00:32:29,328 --> 00:32:31,078
我不是故意让事情变成这样的
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.

405
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,580
你回来找我
You came back for me.

406
00:32:32,582 --> 00:32:34,582
这也算有点价值了
It counts for something.

407
00:32:39,354 --> 00:32:40,720
我们赶紧离开这里吧
Let's just get out of here.

408
00:32:42,457 --> 00:32:43,723
亚雷斯塔
Aleister!

409
00:33:00,908 --> 00:33:02,776
去找埃琳娜和萨凡纳
Find Elena and Savannah.

410
00:33:02,778 --> 00:33:04,177
剩下的我来解决
I'll take care of this.

411
00:33:14,488 --> 00:33:17,056
萨凡纳
Savannah.

412
00:33:17,058 --> 00:33:19,459
我们得走了
We have to go.

413
00:33:19,461 --> 00:33:21,227
抱歉 埃琳娜
Sorry, Elena.

414
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:25,264
我试过反抗
I tried to resist.

415
00:33:26,867 --> 00:33:29,434
但他太厉害了
But he's too strong.

416
00:33:29,436 --> 00:33:31,336
他没有施放魔咒
He didn't do the spell.

417
00:33:31,338 --> 00:33:35,508
他没有杀死那些女巫 我们可以离开
He didn't kill all of the witches. We can go.

418
00:33:38,812 --> 00:33:41,480
我不能
I can't.

419
00:33:41,482 --> 00:33:44,449
我得留下
I have to stay.

420
00:33:44,451 --> 00:33:47,619
她们并不爱我
They don't love me.

421
00:33:47,621 --> 00:33:49,821
她们想要控制我
They want to control me.

422
00:33:49,823 --> 00:33:53,725
你不需要做别的
You don't have to do anything.

423
00:33:53,727 --> 00:33:55,560
好吗 你只要...
Okay? Just...

424
00:33:55,562 --> 00:33:58,263
跟我走 我们离开这 好吗
Come with me. We'll get out of here. Okay?

425
00:33:58,265 --> 00:34:01,432
萨凡纳 你清楚你哪都不会去
Savannah, you know you aren't going anywhere.

426
00:34:03,702 --> 00:34:05,069
斗争直到最后一刻
Fight to the end.

427
00:34:05,071 --> 00:34:06,905
我很佩服
I'm impressed.

428
00:34:06,907 --> 00:34:09,607
我希望我能够多跟你在一起
I wish I could've spent more time with you.

429
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:14,078
我想从你身上得到的一切都得到的
I have everything I need from you.

430
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,613
我不明白
I don't understand

431
00:34:15,615 --> 00:34:18,315
你为什么这么在意这些女巫
why you would care so much about these witches.

432
00:34:18,317 --> 00:34:20,651
不久前 你甚至不知道她们的存在
Not long ago, you didn't even know they existed.

433
00:34:20,653 --> 00:34:22,920
没有她 我是不会走的
I'm not leaving here without her.

434
00:34:22,922 --> 00:34:24,488
那真是太糟了
That's too bad.

435
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:26,290
这就是你的结局
This is how it ends for you.

436
00:34:51,615 --> 00:34:52,815
佩吉
Paige!

437
00:34:52,817 --> 00:34:55,117
放开萨凡纳
Let Savannah go!

438
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,086
佩吉
Paige.

439
00:34:57,088 --> 00:34:58,820
我很高兴是你
I'm glad it's you.

440
00:34:58,822 --> 00:35:01,090
我们从没好好地了解过彼此
We never got the chance to know each other.

441
00:35:01,092 --> 00:35:02,524
我不想了解你
I don't want to know you.

442
00:35:02,526 --> 00:35:05,327
这就是你跟你哥说话的方式
That's no way to talk to your big brother.

443
00:35:11,434 --> 00:35:13,134
不
No.

444
00:35:13,136 --> 00:35:14,535
不可能
It's not possible.

445
00:35:14,537 --> 00:35:16,838
露丝・温特伯恩有一个儿子
Ruth Winterbourne had a son.

446
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,740
是我
Me.

447
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:19,975
你撒谎
You're lying.

448
00:35:19,977 --> 00:35:21,643
她不想要我
She didn't want me.

449
00:35:21,645 --> 00:35:22,553
现在她可以尝尝
But now she'll know the pain of 

450
00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:24,112
失去她在意的孩子的痛苦了
losing the child she did want.

451
00:35:24,114 --> 00:35:25,480
啊 啊 啊 小心点
Ah-ah-ah, careful.

452
00:35:25,482 --> 00:35:28,216
你攻击我 她会受伤的
You come at me, she might get hurt.

453
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:30,585
萨凡纳.
Savannah.

454
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:33,988
他的能量没你强
He doesn't have any power over you.

455
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:36,257
没人能够控制你
No one can control you.

456
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:39,827
让他们瞧瞧 萨凡纳
Show them who you trust, Savannah.

457
00:35:39,829 --> 00:35:41,329
我就是锁
I am the lock.

458
00:35:42,764 --> 00:35:45,532
萨凡纳 我就是锁
Savannah. I am the lock.

459
00:35:48,603 --> 00:35:50,337
我是你的朋友
I am your friend.

460
00:36:17,457 --> 00:36:18,856
佩吉
Paige!

461
00:36:21,893 --> 00:36:23,995
没事了 萨凡纳
It's okay, Savannah.

462
00:36:23,997 --> 00:36:25,163
我们在这
We have you.

463
00:36:25,165 --> 00:36:27,865
你把亚雷斯塔传送到哪了
Where did you send Aleister?

464
00:36:27,867 --> 00:36:29,166
我也不知道
I'm not sure.

465
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,060
成像
Imago.

466
00:36:57,062 --> 00:36:58,495
我就是锁...
I am the lock...

467
00:37:19,082 --> 00:37:20,516
那件事已经结束了
That thing is over!

468
00:37:20,518 --> 00:37:22,618
除非我们离开这 快上来
Not until we're miles away from here. Get in.

469
00:37:24,254 --> 00:37:26,088
罗根 这回
Logan! This time,

470
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:28,391
你得听我的 上车
you're going to do what I say. Get in!

471
00:38:08,396 --> 00:38:09,831
埃琳娜在哪
Where's Elena?

472
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:12,666
她很好 她正带着萨凡纳过来
She's okay. She's taking Savannah to the car.

473
00:38:19,041 --> 00:38:20,507
这是你干的
Did you do this?

474
00:38:22,944 --> 00:38:25,946
是吧
I guess I did.

475
00:38:25,948 --> 00:38:27,281
他死了
He's dead.

476
00:38:30,518 --> 00:38:31,719
终于结束了
It's finally over.

477
00:38:31,721 --> 00:38:34,388
我要找到埃琳娜
I need to find Elena.

478
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:36,123
克莱
Clay!

479
00:38:39,927 --> 00:38:41,361
符号不见了
The symbol's gone.

480
00:38:43,998 --> 00:38:45,132
我在哪里
Where am I?

481
00:38:45,134 --> 00:38:46,366
你记得过去的事吗
Do you remember anything?

482
00:38:46,368 --> 00:38:50,137
我在谢里丹公园喂鸽子
I was feeding pigeons in Sheridan Park,

483
00:38:50,139 --> 00:38:51,972
和一个男人在说...
talking to a man...

484
00:38:51,974 --> 00:38:53,306
哪个城市
What city?

485
00:38:53,308 --> 00:38:55,742
这里不是奥尔巴尼吗
This isn't Albany?

486
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:58,578
发生了什么
What's happening?

487
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,346
我的天呐
Oh my God.

488
00:39:00,348 --> 00:39:01,981
你们是谁
Who are you people?

489
00:39:01,983 --> 00:39:03,383
发生了什么
What happened?

490
00:39:03,385 --> 00:39:05,752
睡吧
Dormi.

491
00:39:05,754 --> 00:39:07,953
他们都醒来的时候 我们就有麻烦了
We're going to have problems when they all wake up.

492
00:39:07,955 --> 00:39:09,188
我能让他们一直睡
I can keep them sleeping.

493
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,823
如果他们在别的地方醒来
But it would be better if they could wake up

494
00:39:10,825 --> 00:39:12,591
会好点
somewhere other than here.

495
00:39:12,593 --> 00:39:13,619
好吧 我们最后再来调查
Okay, the last thing we need is 

496
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,459
这里究竟发生了什么
an investigation into what happened here.

497
00:39:14,461 --> 00:39:16,095
杰里米和尼克会在一小时后到
Jeremy and Nick will arrive in an hour.

498
00:39:16,097 --> 00:39:18,197
让他们来把这些人弄走
They'll figure out how to get these people far away.

499
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:19,516
别让他们记起这发生了什么 
Just as long as they don't remember any of this. 

500
00:39:19,517 --> 00:39:20,132
他们不会的
No, they won't.

501
00:39:20,134 --> 00:39:21,700
我会看着他们的
I'll watch out for them!

502
00:39:24,637 --> 00:39:25,871
睡吧
Dormi.

503
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,986
你还好吗
You okay?

504
00:39:41,988 --> 00:39:43,388
还好
Yeah.

505
00:39:56,568 --> 00:39:58,502
你信守了你的承诺
You kept your promise.

506
00:39:58,504 --> 00:40:01,306
我不想让我的朋友失望
I don't like letting my friends down.

507
00:40:01,308 --> 00:40:03,040
埃琳娜 我们能做朋友吗
Elena, can we stay friends?

508
00:40:03,042 --> 00:40:06,043
不是那种偶尔发发短信的那种
I don't mean texting each other every now and then.

509
00:40:06,045 --> 00:40:07,911
我的意思是...
I mean...

510
00:40:07,913 --> 00:40:10,848
我们可以经常见面
We actually can get to see each other.

511
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:12,115
我也如此
I'd like that.

512
00:40:21,192 --> 00:40:23,026
埃琳娜
Elena!

513
00:40:23,028 --> 00:40:24,361
哦 你没事...
Oh, you're safe...

514
00:40:31,102 --> 00:40:33,370
你成功了
You made it.

515
00:40:33,372 --> 00:40:35,104
没什么能阻止我
Nothing would've stopped me.

516
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:40,977
带我离开这 越远越好
Get me as far away from here as possible.

517
00:40:40,979 --> 00:40:43,380
我带你回家 怎么样
I'll get you home, how about that.

518
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:51,287
他们有没有伤到你
Did they hurt you?

519
00:40:53,257 --> 00:40:54,924
我看见了些东西 克莱
I saw things, Clay.

520
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,594
我几乎失去理智
I almost lost my mind.

521
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:02,131
我会在你身边的
I'll be here for you.

522
00:41:04,467 --> 00:41:06,335
你一直都在
You always were.

523
00:41:33,496 --> 00:41:35,463
这里没有瑞秋和罗根的迹象
There's no sign of Rachel and Logan.

524
00:41:35,465 --> 00:41:36,831
他们肯定逃走了
They must've escaped.

525
00:41:36,833 --> 00:41:38,599
那我们都安全了
Then we're all safe.
