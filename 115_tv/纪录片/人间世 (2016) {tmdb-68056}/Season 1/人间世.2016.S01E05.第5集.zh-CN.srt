1
00:01:48,260 --> 00:00:53,213
In 2015,China has stopped using organs from prisoners of death row

2
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:58,213
So the donation from citizens is the only leagal organ source now

3
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,813
Take a bowl

4
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:09,813
In this year alone,2699 people donated their organs after their death

5
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,813
We don't know the donator

6
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,813
For every donator there is a sad story

7
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,813
We have suffered a lot

8
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,813
The donators have enabled more people to live on

9
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,813
Every effort people made in donation is telling us that

10
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:37,813
The hope of organ transplantation lies in the hospital but not the execution ground 

11
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,890


12
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,852
Reunion

13
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,852
We can go to anywhere as long as there is liver source there

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,852
Show me some confidence,not to panic,not to fear

15
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,552
The liver transplantation is our only hope

16
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,852
I was in great anxiety that I almost cried

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,852
I'm been always thinking about what can I do

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,852
Icteric index is used to indicate the level of 
waste accumulated in our body

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,952
A healthy man's icteric index is below 17

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,952
But Guohong Xu's icteric index has reached 700,
which is 40 times the standard

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,952
Now Xu's liver has been badly hardened

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,952
Xu's life will be over without immediate liver transplantation

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,952
There are a lot of patients like him in this city

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,952
There is nothing we can do,we liver source are not enough

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,952
We can't find any other solutions either

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,952
Since there's no supply of liver,Xu's wife's brother 
decides to donate a part of his liver to Xu

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,952
We have registered in the infestion department

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,952
We have searched a lot of hospitals

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,952
We can't find liver source

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,952
I as his wife wanted to donate my liver,but found mismatch

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,952
His son's liver also don't match his father

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,952
We were worrying when finally my brother stood out

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,952
He said he'd be the donator

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,952
He must save Xu's life

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,852
My brother is really a great man
Really

36
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,952
This is my youngest brother
He is the donator

37
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,952
Yes,he is.He has passed the examination

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,952
The transplantation would have been done 
if not for the examination

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,952
The operation was scheduled yesterday

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,952
The operation room is also really

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,952
- Ready to cut his liver
- Yes,ready

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,952
We are lucky everthing is really now

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,952
She is his wife

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,952
- Then do you agree to your husband's donation?
- She totally agreed that

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,552
I must agree,it's for saving a life

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,952
When he is about to be sent into operation room

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,952
Liver source has been found 

48
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,952
Thank you for your donation,you have done great contribution 
to your country and all the human society

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,952
Now let's mourn

50
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,952
The one lying there is a man aged 50

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,952
He was declared brain dead

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,652
After making sure he was unable to revive

53
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,952
His parents with great sorrow decided to donate 
all his available organs to hospital

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,952
His blood type is O,which matches that of Guohong Xu

55
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,952
We are really grateful to the donator

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,952
But we don't know who the donator is

57
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,952
According to regulation,both sides can't know each other's information

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,952
So Xu's families don't know who is the donator

59
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,952
We have met the families of the donator

60
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,952
His elder sister told us that their parents who are 
80 years old made the decision to donate

61
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,952
That night the two elders really have 
considered for a long time

62
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,952
But they finally signed it on the paper:We are willing 
to donate all the available organs of my son

63
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,952
Ying Yang works in the donation department of Ruijing hospital

64
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,952
She is the only medical personnel to come into 
contact with donator's families

65
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,952
She eyewitnessed the moment when they made 
the decision of donation

66
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,952
I see a lot of papers with words been crossed and 
revised for many times

67
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,952
Maybe because they were hestating,they were wondering if 
they should make the decision or not

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,952
Despite of this,they all made the right decision 
that is to donate organs

69
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:49,952
They want it to be confidential,they don't want more of their 
families to know it in case they object

70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,952
The anaesthesia is used for taking away organ

71
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,952
Other than his liver,the donator also donated both his kidneys

72
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,952
According to the result of matching test and evaluation of severity

73
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,952
The hospital has informed two other patients

74
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,952
Xingsheng Sun,aged 60,with double renal failure

75
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,952
He has been taking peritoneal dialysis for ten years

76
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,952
The hospital phoned us,we were quite excited and came here immediately

77
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,952
The principle is to save the young ones first,we understand that

78
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,952
So we already had prepared to accept that

79
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,952
Assume he is not to live for long

80
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,952
We want him to live happily everyday

81
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,952
Jianyong Zhang,age 48,is a uremic patient

82
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,052
He has been taking hemodialysis for five years

83
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,952
I'm from another city,I was so thrilled

84
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,952
My families drove me here,it took three hours to come here

85
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,952
He is the support of his family

86
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,552
He has both his children and parents to raise

87
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,952
We really can't lose him

88
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,952
- Everyone's life is precious,we will save all of their lives
- Thank you

89
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,952
Three lives,which was about to be gone

90
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,952
Just because of the donator,the candle of hope light up again

91
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,952
With the agreement of the donator's families

92
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,052
We are allowed to shoot the transplantation scene

93
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,952
This is the first time I eyewitness the organs being taken out

94
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,952
The red lines on the sphygmomanometer has become a straight line 

95
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,952
The belly of the donator begin to sink in

96
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,952
He has donated almost all of his available organs in his body

97
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,952
After the transplantation,the doctors sew up the cut
and wipe his body

98
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,952
Change new clothes and shoes for him

99
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,952
When the donator is carried out of the room,everyone
spontaneously stand beside his both sides

100
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,952
They make a final farewell to the body

101
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,952
Now comes to the real chanllege for the doctors doing 
transplantation operation for the three patients

102
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,552
Xianghui Wang and Peijun Zhou are two of the surgeons 
doing transplantation



104
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,952
Oh my god,my fingers are gonna freeze

105
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,952
Hold it tight,be careful

106
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,952
The interface of blood vessels and ureter in the organs
must fit with that of patients

107
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,952
Every single move tolerant no minor mistake

108
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,952


109
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,952
He must have been on dialysis for four or five years

110
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,952
More than that

111
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,952
Two hours of work,finally the patient has got new kidneys
after waiting for two years

112
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,952
Look the urine,we are happy to see that
It's the great reward to us

113
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,952
We made it

114
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,952
What surgeons see as the most valuable thing is the urine bag

115
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,952
Because it means the recovery of the patient's urination functions

116
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,952
- Let's have a close-up
- This is very important

117
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,952
It's OK,he can do the urine nomarlly

118
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,952
The speed is also good

119
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,552
We are reassured to see him peeing,it claims our success
We can have a nice sleep at night

120
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,952
Peijun Zhou is smiling while holding the urine bag of the patient

121
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,952
The patients are still unconscious

122
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,052
After twenty minutes,the two patients wake up

123
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,952
- When does the operation begin?
- The operation is done,it's successful

124
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,952
He can't feel that he has been transplantated

125
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,952
But Guohong Xu and his families are still waiting anxiously

126
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,552
High on jaundice and poor coagulation function

127
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,952
He also has thrombocytopenia

128
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,952
His number of platelet is one tenth of that of a healthy people

129
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,952
Under these circumstances,the operation will be rather difficult

130
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,952
The liver is the central organ of the digestive system

131
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,952
It connects the gallbladder through the bile duct

132
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,952
It also has countless blood vessels in it

133
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,952
A minor mistake may lead to hemorrhea

134
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,552
The risk of this operation is very high

135
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,552
Guohong Xu's liver has been cut off finally,
his liver is hard and black

136
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,552
At 1:34 in the morning,Xu has been transplanted a new liver successfully

137
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,952
For us doctors the operation is finished

138
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,952
But for the patient he still has a lot to do in the future

139
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,952
He has to take care of himself in the best way

140
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,952
As a doctor this job is really tiring

141
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,952
Even my child told me he would never be a doctor 
because it's way too tiring

142
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:17,952
