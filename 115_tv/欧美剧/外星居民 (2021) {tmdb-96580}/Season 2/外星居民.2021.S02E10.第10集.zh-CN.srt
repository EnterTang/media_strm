这满办公室的水是哪来的
What is the office water come from?

27
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,810
我想是管子爆了
I think a pipe burst.

28
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,220
好吧  这房间进入人管大战

真是太棒了
Crazy cool.

143
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,950
我按地理坐标排列了所有我喜欢的地方
So, I have arranged all my favorite places by geographical location

144
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,550
然后给每个活动分配了半个小时
and allotted one half-hour per activity.

145
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,730
最后几页空白的是用来贴照片的
The last few pages are blank for scrapbooking!

146
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:15,790
布特库思能参加你们的欢乐一日游吗
Can the Butkus get in on your day of fun?

147
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,030
亲爱的  我不确定你能不能跟得上
Oh, darling, I'm just not sure you can keep up.

148
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,920
拜托了  美女  至少让我穿上鞋子
Puh-lease, girl. Let me just put on my kicks.

149
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,340
小兔子穿过了地下隧道
The baby rabbit goes through the tunnel

150
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,940
越过了小树  不
and over the log and-- no!

151
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,270
翻过围墙  越过小树
Over the fence and through the log

152
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,270
穿过隧道

153
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,520
不
No!

154
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,780
小兔子在树旁乱跑...
The baby rabbit goes around the log...

155
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,560
好好玩吧
Have a great day.

156
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,160
我去拿外套
I'll just get my coat.

157
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,690
我们来张自拍吧
Let's do a selfie.

158
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,060
孙子  你头发看起来没平时那么翘了
Grandson, your hair looks a little less proud than usual.

159
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,250
-怎么了  -韦弗一家发大水了
- Is something wrong? - The Weavers had a flood,

160
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,090
让我意识到我没有什么精彩的经历
and they made me realize I've got no cool stories.

161
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,170
但我一定会想出一个快要害死我的一个
But I'm gonna come up with one if it kills me.

162
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,100
迪克  和我一起[也有侧踢的意思]

谢你啊  现在过来帮忙
Thank you. Now come help me.

164
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,650
他刚才是说韦弗一家发大水了吗
Did he just say the Weavers had a flood?

165
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:10,560
是的
Yes, he did.

166
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,330
也许我们应该去看看
Perhaps we should go check on them.

167
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,270
-他们也许需要我们的帮忙  -太棒了
- They may need our help. - Yes!

168
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,230
准备好了吗
Are you ready?

169
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,500
他们人呢
Where are they?

170
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,650
也许这算是个好事  你知道吗
Maybe it's good that this happened, you know?

171
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,380
让我们能重新彻底的整理家庭办公室

173
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,310
那边有只死老鼠在玩水上漂
It's a dead mouse floating over there.

174
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,350
弄走它  弄走它
Power through. Power through!

175
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,490
这是我原来的联盟棒球手套
Hey! This is my old little-league mitt!

176
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,410
我还记得那天我爸爸给我时的情形
I remember the day my dad gave me this.

177
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:40,160
他说  "给你  小笨蛋
He said, "Here you go, moron.

178
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,320
"也许这手套有助于你比赛  因为现在
"Maybe this glove will help your game, because right now,

179
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,600
"我看不出你是在打外场
"I can't tell if you're playing the outfield

180
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,840
还是在出柜"
or coming out of the closet."

181
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,360
是啊  他是个好人
Mm. Yeah, he's sweet.

182
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,150
有人吗  有人吗  大家还好吗
Hello, hello! Is everybody okay in here?

183
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,010
伙计们  我们很好  我们很好
Oh, hey, guys. Yeah, we're fine. We're fine.

184
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,580
别想说几句话就把我们赶走
Don't try to talk us out of it.

185
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,750
我们是来帮忙的  我们擅长处理洪水
We're here to help. Floods are kind of our thing.

186
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,050
让我猜猜  你是来面试的
Let me guess-- job interview.

187
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,850
和很多人一样
One of many.

188
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,030
我也是
Me, too.

189
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,300
这些公司根本不知道
These companies are incapable of realizing

190
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,010
我能给他们带来多少好处
how much I have to offer.

191
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,000
可不是嘛
Tell me about it!

192
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,300
我上了四年大专
I went to junior college for four years,

193
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,740
而这些人力资源部的代表却问这种问题
and these H.R. Reps keep being like,

194
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,360
"你想在收发室里干活吗"
"Want to work in the mailroom?"

195
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,990
不  粉碎梦想的大魔头  我不想
No, dream killer, I don't.

196
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,480
我再也不想应聘这些弱爆了的工作了
I'm done applying for lame jobs.

197
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,120
我不是那种"从底层做起"的人
I'm not a "Work your way up" kind of guy.

198
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,880
我可是扎克伯格一样
I'm a Zuckerberg.

199

Oh, me, too, but in the body of a Winklevoss.

201
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,520
文克莱沃斯:扎克伯格校友  起诉扎克伯格并获赔

202
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,850
显而易见
No need to state the obvi.

203
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:34,830
我叫拉菲
I'm Raffi.

204
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,850
我叫拉里
Larry.

205
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,100
你应该和我一起去咖啡店见见我的朋友
You should come hang out with me and my buddies at the coffee shop.

你有兴趣吗
You insky?

208
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,410
老实说
Got to be honest.

209
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,890
你说的话我大概只听懂了三分之一
I'm only getting maybe one out of every three words,

210
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:53,560
但是  拉菲  我太感兴趣了
but, Raffi, I am so insky.

211
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,680
拉里  这就是我的朋友们
Larry, this is my crew.

212
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,760
-哟 -哟

213
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,140
这就是我们工作的地方
And this is where we work.

214
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,740
你是做咖啡的

做咖啡  不  发关于咖啡的东西  马上
Make coffee? No. Blog about coffee? Soon.

216
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,400
你知道网页设计师吗
You know a good web designer?

217
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,080
你是说你在这里坐一整天
You mean you just stay here all day,

218
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,620
做自己的事情  看起来轻松又酷炫
working on your own stuff, looking effortlessly cool?

219
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,900
差不多吧
Eh, pretty much.

220
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,960
这才是我的小伙伴们
My people.

221
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:45,660
拉里・伯德  和那个篮球运动员一样

这是我的照片博客
This is my photo blog.

225
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,460
我给创口贴写了三行诗
I write haikus on band-aids,

226
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,970
然后我把它们写在身上  给自己拍照
then I put them on my body and photograph myself.

227
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,250
所以  我做什么都可以
So, I can work on anything,

228
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,800
哪怕和莫莱的一样不知所谓
even if it's stupid like Mole's thing?

229
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,000
天哪  莫莱啊
Holy Mole?

230
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,830
我应该给我的博客起这个名字的
That's what I should have named my blog.

231
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,800
撑着门
All right, hold the door.

232
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,790
伙计们  我们租了一个真空吸湿器
Okay, guys, we rented a wet vac.

233
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,160
怎么了  伙计们
What's going on, guys?

234
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,920
我们根据我们原来帮助
Well, we came up with a rudimentary organizational system

235
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,410
木星上熔岩海啸受难者的经历
based on what we used to help the victims

236
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:25,230
想出了这个基本组织系统
of the lava tsunami on jupiter.

237
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,550
黛比  我找到了一张你和马蒂的照片
And, Debbie, I found this picture of you and Marty.

238
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,280
-你还穿着白裙子呢  -是的
- And you're in a white dress. - Oh, yes.

239
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,850
那是我们结婚时拍的
Oh, that's our wedding.

240
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,630
我妈妈觉得这条裙子有点夸张了
My mom thought the dress was a bit too much

241
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,610
发型也让我看起来很疯狂
and the hairdo made me seem desperate.

242
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,710
你看起来完美极了
You look perfect!

243
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,300
-我有吗  -看看你嫁的这个人
- I do? - Hey, and check out that stud you're marrying.

244
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,370
真不知道你身上发生了啥
I don't know what happened to you!

245
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,860
我知道  我知道  我爸爸说我一到30岁
I know. I know. My dad says once I hit 30

246
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,710
我就会发福  所以...
that I lost what little looks I had, so...

247
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,960
我本来是想说你变帅了的
Well, I was gonna say you've only gotten handsomer.

248
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,930
什么  小黛  怎么了
What? Deb, what's happening?

249
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,500
我觉得  如果你父母都很好
Well, I think this is what it's like

250
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,390
或父母很清醒的话  就该是这样的
when you have good parents, or at least ones that are sober.

251
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,600
你们在这里啊  我到处找你们
There you are. I've been looking all over.

252
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,560
如果我们现在动身的话
If we leave now,

253
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,780
就可以在洗车场关门之前去一趟
we can go through the car wash before it closes.

254
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,180
简直像重生
It's like being born.

255
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,110
亲爱的  我觉得我们今天不能去
Uh, sweetheart, I don't think we're gonna be able

256
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,440
参观你在地球上的最爱的地方了
to tour your favorite places on earth today.

257
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:15,550
-韦弗家遭洪水了  -他们需要我们
- You see, the Weavers had a flood. - They need us.

258
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:18,190
不然我们明天再做这些好吗
Maybe we could do your day tomorrow, hmm?

259
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,130
当然  再等一天也无妨
Of course. What's another day?

260
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,190
我也来帮忙吧
And maybe if I pitch in,

261
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,030
这样早点完成  也许还有时间再去参观
we can finish up in time to do a few of the things on my list.

262
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,920
太好了
Yes!

263
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:31,010
我四年级的成绩报告单
Oh, oh, my fourth-grade report card!

264
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,390
你能不能看看这些A  说点什么
Could you look at all the As and say something

265
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,990
除了"别让男孩们知道你多聪明"
besides "Don't tell boys you're smart"?

266
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:40,020
你喜欢冒险型还是安全型
Now, do you want the safe option or the risky option?

267
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,110
恶作剧电话要是安全
The prank call didn't become

268
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,650
人气就不可能这么高了
a crazy-story staple by playing it safe.

269
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,810
冒险型
Risky me.

270
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,220
-你好  -女士您好
- Hello? - Hello, ma'am?

271
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,400
-您有女儿吗  -对
- Do you have a daughter? - Yes.

272
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,740
她刚刚遭遇了一场可怕的交通事故
Well, she's been in a horrible car accident.

273
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,920
不不  当我没说
Uh, no, never mind.

274
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,650
-不  她没有  -你到底在说什么
- No, no, she hasn't. - What are you talking about?

275
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,090
我很抱歉
I am so sorry.

276
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,860
迪克  你怎么回事
Dick, what's wrong with you?

277
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,380
我心理很阴暗的
I'm a dark, little dude.

278
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,960
你们分类整理的如何啦
How's the sorting going out there?

279
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,050
人呢
Hello?

280
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,540
妈妈  爸爸
Mommy? Daddy?

281
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,990
本人穿起来更漂亮
Even more beautiful in person.

282
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,950
真的吗
Really?

283
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,820
看我穿白色  你会不会在想
And seeing me in white, you're not thinking,

284
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,320
"你到底想骗谁  黛比拉"
"Who are you trying to fool, Deborah?"

285
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,320
我都不知道那是什么意思  亲爱的
I don't even know what that means, sweetheart.

286
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,670
你是世界上最好的妈妈
You're the best mom.

287
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,980
是啊  看看多漂亮
Yeah! Look at you.

288
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:34,680
其实  虽然我没见过其他人扔棒球
Now, you know, I may have never seen anybody throw a baseball before,

289
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,790
不过你刚刚那绝对是完美的一击
but if that wasn't perfect form, I don't know what is.

290
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,790
谢谢您  乔伊娜-柯西先生
Well thank you, Mr. Joyner-Kersee.

291
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,100
拜托  马蒂
Oh, come on, Marty.

292
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,840
叫我的扎波隆名字吧
Call me by my Zabvronian name.

293
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,010
叫老爸
It's Daddy.

294
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,060
这个嘛
Oh, well, you know what?

295
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,560
可能会有一点奇怪
That would probably be a little bit weird

296
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,310
因为在地球上的意思是...
Because here on earth, that means --

297
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,780
-接得不错  马蒂  -谢谢  老爸
- Great catch, Marty! - Thanks, Daddy!

298
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,030
你居然打算这样做
I can't believe you're doing this.

299
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,720
-媒体上会全是绯闻的  -我知道
- It's got scandal written all over it. - I know.

300
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,100
不过麦莉・赛勒斯教会了我
But as Miley Cyrus taught me,

301
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,530
想有好故事  绝对不能穿衣服
you don't get a good story by keeping your clothes on.

302
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,120
来吧
Let's do this!

303
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,730
哥哥  不要啊
Brother, don't!

304
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,010
我成功了
I'm doing it.

305
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,800
我在裸泳
I'm skinny dipping!

306
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:25,060
其实  这情景没我想得震撼
Turns out, this is not an "Omg" Moment.

307
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,580
穿好衣服  流浪汉
Cover up, tramp.

308
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,480
我决定在微博客展示一下[社交分享网站]
I've decided to work on a Tumblr

309
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,350
怎样才能优雅  睿智
about how to have the grace, intellect,

310
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,710
拥有卓越领袖的能力
and "X" Factor of a supreme leader.

311
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,210
"这些只能与生俱来
"You're either born with an 'x' factor or you aren't,

312
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,680
所以努力生好点吧"
so try to be born with it."

313
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,320
太棒了
Ooh, that is epic!

314
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,680
等等
Wait a minute.

315
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,180
连接错误
无法连接到网络

316
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,400
怎么回事  我的人生建议网站不见了
What -- what happened to my life-advice website?

317
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,770
试用时间结束了
Your trial period expired.

318
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,490
新规定是  五美元消费
There's a new policy where you only get

319
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:56,540
可以换得一小时的无线网络使用时间
an hour of Wi-fi for every $5 purchase,

320
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,780
所以得充值了  兄弟
so time to muffin up, hombre.

321
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,240
我应该跟谁反映
Who do I talk to about this?

322
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,460
我是拉里・伯德
I am larry bird,

323
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,540
"像我一样卓越"网站的财务总监
CFO, president, and sole subscriber

324
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,220
董事长  以及唯一用户
of the website "Supreme like me,"

325
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,200
也是Hollymolly网站的资深顾问
as well as consulting producer of Holymolly.org.

326
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,590
我有权免费使用wifi
And I deserve free wi-fi!

327
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,220
这里的规矩不是我定的
Look, I don't make the rules around here.

328
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,970
买一杯咖啡  我就把密码给你
You buy a cup of coffee, I give you a slip.

329
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,530
好吧  这是你逼我的
Fine. You're going to force my hand.

330
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,310
大家都免费用吧
Free internet for everyone!

331
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,220
快来拿密码
Come get your password!

332
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,380
无线网络送给你
Viva la wi-fi! Ha ha!

333
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,960
这是wifi密码  不需要任何消费
Here's a wi-fi password. No purchase necessary.

334
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:52,760
博客里写到我时  写好点
When you blog about me, blog well.

335
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,630
wifi密码
Wi-fi password.

336
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,320
这他妈是怎么回事
What the hell's going on here?

337
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,230
有免费wifi的美好世界  你谁啊
Just free wi-fi utopia. Who are you?

338
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,230
-老板  -是吗
- The owner. - Oh.

339
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,850
抱歉  艾伦
Uh, sorry about that, Alan.

340
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:05,840
这样吧  给所有人来杯拿铁寄我老爹账上
Here. Put a round of lattes on my old man.

341
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,820
-应该可以抵消免费网络的费用吧  -什么
- That should cover the free internet. - What?

342
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,250
你爸爸给了你一张信用卡
You have a credit card from your father?

343
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,440
是啊
Uh, yeah.

344
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,590
我们大多都这样  不然怎么付钱
Most of us do. That's how we pay for stuff.

345
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:16,150
我的天哪
Oh, my god.

346
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,930
你们这些被宠坏的富二代
You' just a bunch of spoiled, rich kids

347
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,490
只会啃父母的钱
living off your parents!

348
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,570
怪不得找不到工作
No wonder you can't find jobs!

349
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,060
你们这群臭小子
You lazy, self-entitled...

350
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,570
懒惰无用  自恋至极
trust-fund brats.

351
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:32,490
说得真狠  我才34岁
Harsh, man, I am only 34.

352
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,560
听着  这都是我干的
Listen, this is all my doing.

353
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,990
我最近很不顺  我岳父岳母搬来了
I've had a tough time lately. My in-laws have moved in.

354
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:39,910
而且我失业了
I'm unemployed.

355
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,350
由于冬天  我的头发很干
Winter's really drying out my hair.

356
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,020
兄弟  出来讨生活的
Look, pal, you're not the only one

357
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:44,910
不只你一个
out there trying to make it.

358
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,800
大家都不容易  好吗
It's tough out there for everyone, all right?

359
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,470
我孩子上高中  每个月
I got a high-schooler who can't seem to stay

360
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,070
要发上千条短信
under a thousand texts a month,

361
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,700
我刚刚花了五百元
and I just dropped a half a grand

362
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,760
送我家小孩去参加贾斯汀・比伯的音乐会
taking my littlest to the Justin Bieber concert.

363
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,290
不过至少她抓到了他的背心  那可是无价的
But at least she caught his tank top, so priceless!

364
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,430
我孩子花费也很多
I, too, have expensive children.

365
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,810
如果钱买不到幸福  怎么不告诉我家孩子
If money can't buy you happiness, no one told my kids.

366
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,080
是啊  我就是这意思
Well, yeah, that's what I'm talking about, you know?

367
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,710
所以我才开始了新的网络规定
That's why I got the new internet policy.

368
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,480
不打不相识
In light of today's debacle,

369
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,740
我知道这话有点冒昧
I know this is a pretty long shot,

370
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,440
不过你还招人吗
but do you have any openings here?

371
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,160
我什么都可以做  你需要什么我就做什么
I'll do anything -- whatever you need.

372
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,890
我准备好从基层做起了
I'm ready to start at the bottom.

373
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,560
我的天  你在干什么呢
Oh, my god. What are you doing?

374
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,960
我要做件值得跟你提及的事情
I'm going to do something worth telling you about,

375
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,180
哪怕这事会害死我
even if it kills me!

376
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,500
这很有可能害死我  所以我现在就得告诉你
And it might literally kill me, so I got to tell you right now

377
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,950
你穿那件高翻领毛衣帅极了
that you look slamming in that turtleneck.

378
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,220
抱歉  我现在如此邋遢
I'm sorry for being so raunchy!

379
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,740
你说什么值得跟我提及的故事
What do you mean, a story worth telling me?

380
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,040
我没什么可以跟你说的
I have nothing to tell you,

381
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,820
我担心你会觉得我无聊
and I'm worried that you're gonna get bored of me!

382
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,100
你疯了吗
Are you insane?

383
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,600
雷吉  每一天
Reggie, every day,

384
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,260
你都会看着我觉得理所当然的东西
you look at something I take for granted

385
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,270
好像那就是全世界最酷的一样
like it's the coolest thing in the world.

386
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:52,860
还有  现在这样  我在屋顶下和你说话
And by the way, this right here, me talking you off a roof,

387
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:56,220
就能算是一个疯狂的故事了
this counts as a crazy story.

388
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,210
谢谢你
Oh, thank you.

389
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,090
我这就下来
I'll be right down.

390
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,280
穿着那高翻领毛衣你得小心点
And you better watch yourself in that turtleneck,

391
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:07,450
因为我一下来就要紧紧抱着你
because when I get down, I'm going to...hug you close.

392
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,700
这是什么
Oh. What's this?

393
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:15,820
那是”尽情吃”自助餐的礼券
Oh, that's a gift certificate to an all-you-can-eat buffet.

394
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,660
我妈妈给我的  因为她错过了我的毕业典礼
My mom gave it to me because she missed my graduation.

395
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,890
她说第二天我们要去吃顿丰富的午餐
She said that we were gonna have a big celebration lunch

396
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,610
庆祝一下  就我们两人
the next day, just the two of us.

397
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:26,940
简单说吧  证书还在
Oh. Well, let's just say I still have the certificate.

398
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,310
我相信她没去一定是有很好的理由
Oh. I'm sure there's a very good reason why she wasn't there.

399
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,600
一家叫做”砰砰”的卖山寨抹胸的商店
There was a fire sale at a store called Boom Boom

400
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,840
在搞大甩卖
that sold irregular tube tops.

401
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:36,860
再说了  我不觉得
Besides, I don't think

402
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,990
忽视自己的孩子会有什么好理由
there's ever a good reason to ignore your child.

403
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,200
你说得对
No.

404
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,450
丈夫
Husband!

405
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:48,030
-怎么了  -我们得走了
- What's the matter? - We have to go.

406
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,830
我们的乐于助人耽误了
We've let our helpfulness get in the way

407
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,660
我们该陪伴女儿的时间
of spending time with our daughter!

408
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,720
该死  总是这样
Oh, damn! This always happens!

409
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,110
-你们现在就要走了  是吗  -是的
- You're leaving now, aren't you? - Mm-hmm.

410
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,560
-但是我们需要搭个车  -我开车送你们
- But we need a ride. - Oh! I'll drive you.

411
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,360
老爸  你去哪了
Daddy, where did you go?!

412
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,190
别这样看着我
No. It's okay,

413
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,960
他名字就是老爸  这么叫不奇怪
because his name is Daddy, so it's not weird.

414
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,070
谢谢你们送我们来  韦弗夫妇
Thanks for the ride, Weavers.

415
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,030
不  是谢谢你们的帮忙
Well, no. Thank you for all your help.

416
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,920
是啊  我们那些东西都会带来糟糕的回忆
Yeah, and all that stuff we have that brought back bad memories?

417
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,940
现在终于有个好事了
Well, we now have good ones to go with them.

418
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,700
-谢谢  -晚安  你们俩
- Thank you. - Good night, guys.

419
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,030
-晚安  -拜
- Good night. - Bye.

420
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,300
-又无父无母了  -至少我们还有孩子们
- Parentless again. - Well, at least we have our kids.

421
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:30,010
-有吗  他们抛弃了我们  -是啊
- Do we? They abandoned us. - Yeah, they did.

422
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,170
我们的父母很糟糕  我们也变成了糟糕的父母
We had lousy parents, we became lousy parents,

423
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,900
现在我们的孩子也很糟糕
and now we have lousy kids.

424
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:36,340
-吃点冻酸奶吗  -必须的
- Froyo? - Always.

425
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,330
最后一站  隐山购物中心停车场
Last stop -- Hidden Hills mall parking lot.

426
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,040
你们清理完韦弗家的洪灾了吗
You done cleaning up the Weavers' flood?

427
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,280
没有  只是我们意识到有个更重要的地方
No, we just realized there was someplace more important

428
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,560
我们必须要去
that we needed to be.

429
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,010
非常抱歉  杰西
We're so sorry, Jackie.

430
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,470
只是拥有了全世界
It's just that when you have

431
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,700
最能干的女儿之后
the world's most capable daughter,

432
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,300
很容易就忘了她也需要你
it's easy to forget that she needs you, too.

433
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,010
的确是
Well, she does.

434
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:13,570
那么告诉我  为什么这个停车场
So...tell me, why is this parking lot

435
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:16,450
是你在地球最爱的地点之一呢
one of your most favorite places on earth?

436
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,020
我爱的不是停车场
It's not the parking lot.

437
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,400
而是那个十字路口
It's that four-way intersection.

438
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,700
糟糕了
Oh, oh, this will not end well.

439
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,380
我都瞧见了
Now I've seen everything!

440
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,940
你觉得这样的布局
You think a setup like that

441
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,290
肯定会变成大灾难
Would end in constant catastrophe.

442
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,470
但不知为何  每个人都会搞清楚该如何相处
But somehow, everyone figures out how to coexist.

443
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,810
有时人们会落得坏名声
Humans get a bad rap sometimes.

444
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,820
但我发现多半情况
But I've found that more often than not,

445
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,310
他们都能够照顾好其他人
they manage to look out for one another...

446
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,520
在你最意想不到的时候
...and come through for each other

447
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,730
帮助你安然度过困境
when you least expect it.

448
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,250
也许我刚刚说的那些事情
And maybe all those things I just said

449
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,600
并不完全适用于十字路口
don't totally apply to intersections.

450
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:18,520
但这就是为什么这是地球上我最爱的地点之一
But that is why this is one of my favorite places on earth.

451
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:23,130
谢谢你和我们分享
Thank you for sharing it with us.

452
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,030
我能明白你为什么喜欢这里
I can see why you love it here.

453
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,900
这是我的荣幸
It's my pleasure.

454
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,610
你们又要走了  是吗
You're leaving again, aren't you?

455
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,940
在邻近的月球上有一个部落
There's a tribe on a neighboring moon

456
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,270
遭受着一场严重的饥荒
that's suffering a terrible famine.

457
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:44,300
而你父亲  非常擅长灌溉
And your father has such a way with irrigation.

458
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,920
当然  我理解
No, of course. I understand.

459
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,270
拍张照片放在剪贴簿里
For the scrapbook.

460
00:19:58,910 --> 00:19:59,980
我回来啦
I'm home!

461
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,470
这个还在享受信托基金的女婿
And this trust-fund brat of a son-in-law

462
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,890
刚刚自己找到了一个入门级的工...
just got himself an entry-level jo-- oh.

463
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,860
你说过你不想在这里
You said you didn't want to be here

464
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,490
收拾残局  你可以走了
to pick up the pieces, so you can just go.

465
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,920
我亲爱的  你不知道吗
Oh, my darling, don't you know?

466
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:19,280
帮你收拾残局是我做过的唯一不收费的工作
Picking up your pieces is the only job I'd do for free.

467
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,190
十字路口怎么样
How was the four-way intersection?

468
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,010
没有我是不是不一样了
Not the same without me, right?

469
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,510
完全不同
Not at all.

470
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,780
今天真的好漫长
Really slow day.

471
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,620
你在说谎
You're lying.

472
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,340
我错过了什么
What did I miss?

473
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,650
好吧  好吧
All right, fine.

474
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,290
同时来了四辆车
There were four cars at once.

475
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,500
最终优先权的那辆车不乐意了
The ultimate right-of-way challenge.

476
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,280
好极了
Hot damn!

477
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,530
-跟我描绘一下  -微风徐徐
- Paint the scene for me. - It was a little bit windy.

478
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:15,230
-接得好  猛虎  -谢了  黛比
- Ooh, great catch, tiger. - Thanks, Debbie.

479
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,830
你看起来容光焕发
You look radiant, by the way.

480
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:17,900
你一看就像那种男人想要
You look like the kind of girl

481
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,630
共度一生的女孩
a man would want to spend a life with.

482
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:24,610
你的手臂可以媲美专业棒球手
And you have the arm of a professional ballplayer.

483
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,610
-不一样  -不一样
- It's not the same. - Nope.

484
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:30,830
-冻酸奶吗  -必须的
- Froyo? - Yeah. Always.
