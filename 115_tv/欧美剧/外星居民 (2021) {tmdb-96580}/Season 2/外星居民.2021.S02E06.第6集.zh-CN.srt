1
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,680

Spring.

2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,110

The birds are singing, the flowers are blooming,

3
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,710

the sun warms the Earth.

4
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,220

Somewhere. Not here.

5
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,420

It's 30 degrees out.

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,550

It snowed 9 feet last winter,

7
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,760

and four frozen sodas just exploded in my truck.

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,260

Welcome to Patience, Colorado.

9
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,220

So this is the "Doctor by the lake"

10
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,550

everybody was talking about?

11
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,650

He's owned the cabin since 2004.

12
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,760

Comes and stays for a week at a time.

13
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,260

Until last winter, he came late December, been here ever since.

14
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,030

Huh. What is he, retired or something?

15
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,170

What does he do out here?

16
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,730

I think he's fishing.

17
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,870

I am in the middle of nowhere.

18
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,210

A tiny town three hours from the nearest city

19
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,880

on roads that are impassable half the year.

20
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,550

Nobody in their right mind would live in a place

21
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,050

like this,

22
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,990

unless they have something to hide.

23
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,290

Excuse me, sir. You Dr. Harry Vanderspeigle?

24
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,430

Yes, that's me.

25
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,370

Yeah, I'm Sheriff Mike Thompson.

26
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,300

Everybody calls me Big Black.

27
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,310

‐ Because of your truck? ‐ Because of‐‐oh.

28
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,580

Oh, you funny, huh? You funny?

29
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,950

This here's my deputy, Liv Baker.

30
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,380

You can just call me Liv.

31
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:37,320

Or Deputy‐‐Deputy Liv.

32
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,920

Stupid.

33
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,420

What can I help you with?

34
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:44,960

Well, we had ourselves a murder in town last night.

35
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,530

You're a doctor.

36
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,300

We need you to come down and take a look at the body.

37
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,970

Isn't there a town doctor who can help you out?

38
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,600

Yeah, well, see, that's the thing.

39
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:57,310

The victim is the town doctor... Doctor.

40
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,490

When Neil Armstrong became the first human

41
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,120

to step on their moon, he said

42
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,990

he wasn't chosen to be first.

43
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:19,130

It was merely circumstance.

44
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:22,500

Circumstance put him in the pilot seat on that mission,

45
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,400

and circumstance pulled me from the pilot seat on mine.

46
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,110

When I first came to Earth,

47
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,580

I didn't expect to even set foot on the planet.

48
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,500

Circumstance.

49
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,830

Stranded on an alien planet.

50
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,700

In order to survive and complete my mission,

51
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,600

I would have to somehow fit in with the human life forms.

52
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,480

Is there someone in here?

53
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,660

I got news for you, Cosette.

54
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:42,160

There's no such thing as hooker‐client confidentiality.

55
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,570

I got news for you, Cosette.

56
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:53,040

I got news‐‐Cose...

57
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,580

I got news for you, Cosette.

58
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,780

I've got news for you, Cosette.

59
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,250

I got news for you, Cosette.

60
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,190

I've got news for you, Cosette.

61
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,360

I got news for you, Cosette.

62
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,730

I've got news for you, Cosette.

63
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,370

When my ship crashed, I lost precious cargo,

64
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,940

a device I need to complete my mission.

65
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,440

I have to find it before the snow melts,

66
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,240

or someone else will.

67
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,550

Put it in my truck. I'll bring it back.

68
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,190

I've never been into town before.

69
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,430

It's just too risky.

70
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,700

Plus, they don't have a pizza place

71
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,930

and the internet said that parking was a nightmare.

72
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,600

But here I am.

73
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,110

My first real test.

74
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,680

To say my species is more advanced than humans

75
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,410

would be a massive understatement.

76
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:11,020

If the universe had a scale for intelligence,

77
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,420

humans would land right below lizards.

78
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,600

Well, we're waiting.

79
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,300

Ah, hello, doctor. I'm Ben.

80
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,700

I'm the mayor.

81
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,010

Thanks for getting him, Mike.

82
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,010

I told you to call me Big Black.

83
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:38,580

Yeah. I'm not comfortable with that.

84
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,150

Thank you so much for coming.

85
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,650

Obviously, we had to close down the clinic,

86
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:42,820

which has been a bit of a problem

87
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,950

since the nearest hospital is over three hours away.

88
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:50,130

The body is right down here.

89
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,080

I'd say, from the smell,

90
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,580

she's been dead at least six hours.

91
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,720

What the mother hell?

92
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,950

‐ You're not dead. ‐ Yeah, no shit.

93
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,250

I was sleeping.

94
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,090

She's not the dead doctor.

95
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,720

He's over there.

96
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,960

Asta's the nurse.

97
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,500

She's the one who found him here this morning

98
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,670

when she got to work. 

99
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,130

I know this is hard for everyone.

100
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,540

But a grief counselor is coming

101
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,070

to speak to each and every one of us.

102
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,740

Oh, yeah. Good job, snowflake.

103
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,270

Is that coming out of the town budget,

104
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,580

or is he working for hugs?

105
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,610

‐ Who are you? ‐ I'm Harry Vanderspeigle.

106
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:45,810

I'm a doctor.

107
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,580

Mayor Snowflake had them bring me down

108
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,050

to look at the dead body.

109
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:52,020

‐ Please don't call me that. ‐ Isn't that your name?

110
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,790

‐ Pretty much. ‐ Okay, all right.

111
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:57,630

So this is Sam Hodges.

112
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,830

He was the town doctor.

113
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,560

Abigail was the doctor's wife. She's been out of town.

114
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,870

‐ Let me know when she calls. ‐ You'll know.

115
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:08,200

‐ I gave her your number. ‐ What?

116
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,900

Well, you're the mayor.

117
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,370

And I don't know how to tell someone their husband died.

118
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,580

Yeah, give her my number. I'll tell her he's dead.

119
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,940

I don't give a shit.

120
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,280

Who was the last person to see him alive?

121
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,650

Me.

122
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:23,150

I left him here alone probably around 9:00.

123
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,320

When I came in this morning, he was...

124
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,450

‐

125
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,890

I covered him with the sheet.

126
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:36,430

This... is...

127
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,770

awesome.

128
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:41,270

What? What's awesome?

129
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,240

A good mystery, figuring out what happened,

130
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,640

like "Law and Order."

131
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,610

Clung‐clung!

132
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,150

That was fun.

133
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,720

‐ Fun? ‐ Yeah. I know who killed him.

134
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,720

‐ Who? ‐ He did.

135
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,460

The angle of the wounds,

136
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,300

the way the blood is on his hand.

137
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,030

He murdered himself.

138
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,540

And why in the hell would he do that?

139
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,870

I don't know. I wasn't here.

140
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,050

All right, look, that's one creepy son of a bitch, right?

141
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,520

That ain't just me, right? Y'all all see that, right?

142
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,960

Yeah, but it's okay for people to be

143
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,490

a little bit different sometimes.

144
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:38,060

Look at what he did. What was‐‐what's a chung‐chung?

145
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:41,730

‐ Can you not talk to me? ‐ Wait.

146
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,430

Please don't tell me that you're leaving.

147
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,000

Okay, I won't.

148
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,640

Um...

149
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,510

No, but we still need your help.

150
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,510

I was asked to come look at a dead body.

151
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:57,350

I did that. Do you have more dead bodies?

152
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,980

‐ No. ‐ Then I have to go.

153
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:08,260

Wait. You looked at the body for two seconds.

154
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,430

Look, maybe you're right. Maybe he killed himself.

155
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:15,630

But if he didn't, there is a killer out there, okay?

156
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,670

We need to do an autopsy.

157
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,030

Do you mean cut into the body

158
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,400

and pull out the organs autopsy?

159
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,440

Yeah. Yes, that kind. Yeah.

160
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,940

The paths got snowed in last night,

161
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,410

and the coroner won't come until the roads clear.

162
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:30,080

But lucky for us, the man who used

163
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,910

to run the pathology lab at Rutgers lives in town.

164
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:36,850

Well, don't call that guy. I'll do the autopsy.

165
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:39,990

That guy is you, I...

166
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,790

I looked you up. You ran the lab at Rutgers.

167
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:45,060

Of course I ran the lab. I knew that.

168
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,160

I was making a joke. I'm a very funny person.

169
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,200

Okay, good.

170
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,270

Okay, well, I got to go. But you've got this. Okay?

171
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:06,480

We'll get one, right? Max?

172
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,650

‐

173
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:14,490

Max?

174
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:17,260

Max! Hey.

175
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,960

Let me in the car.

176
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,940

How is this possible?

177
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,040

Only 1 in 1 million humans have the genetic mutation

178
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,110

that enables them to see

179
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,610

through our molecular reconstruction,

180
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:38,410

yet somehow in a town of a thousand people

181
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,350

there is a runny‐nosed kid

182
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:43,080

who can see me in my true form?

183
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,450

That means there are more people in this town

184
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,190

who can see me as an alien

185
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,660

than there are slices of pizza.

186
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,930

Humans have a term for this:

187
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:54,430

"Bad luck," And "Raw deal,"

188
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:57,070

and "This is some bullshit."

189
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,410

Why are you standing in here?

190
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:08,980

Because I'm assisting you with the autopsy.

191
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,010

No, you're not.

192
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,050

You're still standing here.

193
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,250

Sam Hodges has been my doctor since I was a kid.

194
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,490

And I'm not going anywhere

195
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,820

until I know what happened to him.

196
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,660

Fine.

197
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,360

You can stand there...

198
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,130

and take notes.

199
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,530

Do I look like a stenographer?

200
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:35,200

‐ Then why are you here? ‐ 'Cause I don't trust you.

201
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,210

You said he killed himself, but he would never do that.

202
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,040

There are multiple cuts in the neck.

203
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,180

The angle of all of them is consistent with the cuts

204
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,110

coming from his own hand,

205
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,110

the back of which was covered in blood but not the palm

206
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,020

because it was clenched around the scalpel.

207
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,990

Sounds great.

208
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,860

He didn't kill himself.

209
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,220

I'm smarter than you.

210
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,660

‐ What are you, 12? ‐ Don't feel bad.

211
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,160

It's just a fact.

212
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,660

Once you accept it, you will stop fighting me.

213
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,170

You want facts?

214
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,500

Okay, I'll give you two. Um...

215
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,900

You're kind of a dick.

216
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,480

That is just one.

217
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,940

Sam loved his life.

218
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,610

And he would never kill himself.

219
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,310

And if for some reason he did,

220
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,580

he sure shit wouldn't stab himself

221
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,790

over and over again in the front of the neck.

222
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,520

Okay, you're so smart.

223
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,020

Where would be have stabbed himself?

224
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,220

Probably his carotid artery.

225
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,100

He was a doctor. If he wanted to kill himself,

226
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,340

he would have sliced his carotid.

227
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,470

How did I miss that? I'm smarter than a lizard.

228
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:47,140

‐ So you admit he was murdered? ‐ No.

229
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,980

Wait, did you just call me a lizard?

230
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,380

No. I compared you to a lizard.

231
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:01,190

Okay. We don't have to talk while we do this.

232
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,810

Look, I know you really didn't want to do this.

233
00:16:55,810 --> 00:17:01,080

So I just wanted to say that I appreciate you helping us.

234
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,580

You‐‐you did a good job.

235
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,490

You just gave me a compliment.

236
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,090

Yeah?

237
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:18,130

You know, pandas are so stupid,

238
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:20,870

sometimes they don't even realize they're pregnant.

239
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:24,140

And when they give birth, they're like, "What is this?"

240
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,970

And then they kill their crying babies.

241
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,410

What?

242
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,210

I compared you to a lizard before.

243
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:35,220

But that's not so bad. Pandas are really dumb.

244
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,920

Um, if that was you returning the compliment,

245
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,320

you should try again.

246
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,690

I like your brown skin.

247
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,660

I guess I should quit while I'm ahead.

248
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,860

I'm gonna go across the street to The 59

249
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,070

to get a drink if you want to come.

250
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:55,100

‐ I have work to do. ‐ The autopsy's done.

251
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,900

What work do you have to do at 8:00 at night?

252
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,640

I strangled and drowned a guy four months ago

253
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,710

and I have to search the lake for his bloated corpse

254
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,410

before some fisherman finds it.

255
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,510

Just stuff.

256
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,120

Suit yourself.

257
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:13,350

Feel free to come by if you ever stop being a weirdo.

258
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,730

Weirdo? That's not good.

259
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,530

Now I have to meet her over there

260
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,200

and prove to her I fit in,

261
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,400

that I'm normal like them.

262
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,700

But first I'm going to cut Sam Hodges' brain

263
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,940

out of his head and squish it in my hands.

264
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,730

This is amazing.

265
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,740

Who's the weirdo now?

266
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,970

Hi. I'm Abigail Hodges. Sam's wife.

267
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,240

He's not home. Is he here?

268
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,950

Yeah.

269
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,580

She walked in?

270
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,850

What did you do?

271
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,790

I put down the brain to shake her hand.

272
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,920

She ran out.

273
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,990

Her voice goes very loud.

274
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:25,990

Jesus!

275
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:29,400

Sam's first wife Rosy died years ago.

276
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,700

She was like a mother to me. God knows I needed one.

277
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,670

This is when you're supposed to ask me about my childhood.

278
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,510

Why? I don't care.

279
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,010

Nobody cares.

280
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:50,120

That's not the point.

281
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,550

I left home when I was 16,

282
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,520

then I married a biker in Denver.

283
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,290

Jimmy and I split four months ago,

284
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:02,000

which is the reason I'm buying you dinner.

285
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,170

Why?

286
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,500

'Cause you have a pick‐up truck.

287
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,170

And I was hoping you could take me tomorrow

288
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,640

to get the rest of my things.

289
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,670

I'll buy him dinner for less than that.

290
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:14,710

Hi, D'arcy. This is Harry.

291
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,910

He's a doctor, and he's new in town.

292
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,350

He's been helping us out.

293
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,350

Ooh, doctor.

294
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:23,650

Oh. Oh, shit, right, 'cause of Sam.

295
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:27,820

I'm so sorry, Asta. They find out who did it yet?

296
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,390

Nope. Not yet.

297
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:32,530

Why are the walls covered in old mining equipment?

298
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:35,760

You are new, aren't you? The 59!

299
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,600

The 59!

300
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,270

Died to save one. Town motto.

301
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:44,870

Maybe stick around long enough, you'll find out what it means.

302
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:48,240

To The 59.

303
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,050

And to finding the bastard who killed Sam.

304
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,450

I'll drink to that.

305
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,120

Wow. What is that?

306
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,530

That's our local whiskey.

307
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:08,030

‐ It's pretty great, right? ‐ No. It's awful.

308
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,570

Why do I want more?

309
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,900

That's because you're bad. You like being bad,

310
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,510

which is great news because I like bad boys.

311
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:27,850

Is there more?

312
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,120

Ting, ting, ting.

313
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,130

All right, man, you're on.

314
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,120

Yes! D'arc, D'arc!

315
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:39,220

Harry, yeah! 

316
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:56,970

Shot, shot, shot!

317
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,650

Harry, Harry. No, no, no, no.

318
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,680

You okay to drive home or you gonna dance home?

319
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,880

That would be fun but impractical.

320
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,990

Hey, pick me up at the clinic at 10:00?

321
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,690

Sure.

322
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,560

Good night, Harry the Doctor.

323
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,870

Harry the Doctor!

324
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,840

It's over.

325
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,210

I just spent a whole day with them

326
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:12,480

and I fit in perfectly.

327
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:18,350

Nobody could tell I was different.

328
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,890

Almost nobody.

329
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,530

The answer's simple.

330
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:33,870

It's nighttime.

331
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,600

I'll just break into that kid's house

332
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,070

and kill him.

333
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:39,240

I'll say one thing about whiskey,

334
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:44,040

it's allowing me to make smart, rational decisions.

335
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,940

Do not make a sound.

336
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,640

That's good. Don't worry.

337
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,640

I'm not going to hurt you.

338
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,880

I'm just going to kill you.

339
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,020

‐ Oh! ‐ Max?

340
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,860

Hey, what's going on?

341
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,330

There's an alien under the bed!

342
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:45,200

Let's go, sweetie.

343
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,830

Come on, buddy. No more stories, okay?

344
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,140

It's not a story!

345
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,170

Hey, Max, I can't do it, okay?

346
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:52,240

I can't have another night with no sleep. Let's go.

347
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,370

‐ No! ‐ Max, you can sleep with us.

348
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:55,880

‐ You don't want to die! ‐ We're not gonna die, Max.

349
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,580

I'm gonna give you the count of three. Get down.

350
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,010

No!

351
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:01,080

There's nothing under the bed. One, two‐‐

352
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,920

There you go.

353
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,920

I told you not to let him watch those movies.

354
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:10,420

I watched "E. T." When I was his age.

355
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,030

It's all right. Come on.

356
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:44,690

Whiskey, headache, nausea,

357
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:46,430

severe dehydration.

358
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:56,570

Alcohol must not affect humans the way it does us.

359
00:27:56,570 --> 00:28:01,240

If it did, they obviously would never drink it.

360
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,940

What the‐‐the hell are you doing?

361
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,340

I just thought we could listen

362
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,480

to some music or something.

363
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,940

Music?

364
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,210

Girl, I got your music right here.

365
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,380

Shh, shh. Quiet.

366
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,050

Hot damn!

367
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,490

I thought I'd never see your face again

368
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,320

after what you did last night.

369
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,330

You know about last night?

370
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,530

Yeah, I knew there was something off about you.

371
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:30,330

Sheriff thinks you took Sam's body.

372
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:32,870

Yep, that's right, amigro.

373
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,840

Yeah, you're getting that twitching, aren't you,

374
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,240

down in your taint? You know why?

375
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,510

That's your body's way of telling you you're guilty.

376
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:44,010

Now why don't you go and admit what your taint already knows.

377
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:47,250

You took that doctor's body, didn't you? Didn't you?

378
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:50,320

‐ Of course I took his body. ‐ What?

379
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:56,190

This ain't right.

380
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:58,460

What was he supposed to do after the autopsy?

381
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,490

Put Sam in the freezer next to the ice cubes?

382
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:01,700

I considered that,

383
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,300

but I would have had to saw him in half.

384
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,530

Oh, you think this is funny, huh?

385
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:05,870

You think this is funny?

386
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,430

Ain't you got no respect for the dead?

387
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,270

Of course I do.

388
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:14,370

Ms. Twelvetrees? I'm done with the intake forms.

389
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:16,040

Jay, this is Dr. Vanderspeigle.

390
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,750

‐ He'll be helping us out. ‐ Hi.

391
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,250

You have a fly on your neck.

392
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,420

It's a birthmark, douchebag.

393
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:30,420

Douche... bag.

394
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:36,900

Sorry, Jay is having a hard time with Sam's murder.

395
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,230

She helps us out at the clinic.

396
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:43,600

There's not a lot going on here for kids her age.

397
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,540

Having her work at the clinic keeps her off the street.

398
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,410

What's wrong with the street?

399
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,180

This town looks like a slice of Americana,

400
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,220

but trust me, it has an underbelly.

401
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,220

That's why I help kids like Jay.

402
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,460

This is it.

403
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:18,910

Are you coming?

404
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,010

Yes, in one minute.

405
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:31,790

"Douche... bag."

406
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,620

"A small syringe for douching the vajeena."

407
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,460

Images.

408
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,230

What the hell?

409
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,830

"Taint."

410
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,080

Hey, you can just put that stuff in the box.

411
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:17,460

Some people believe the buck symbolizes protection

412
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,270

and rebirth.

413
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,470

Protection from what?

414
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:23,940

Everything.

415
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:36,280

Thank you so much for helping me.

416
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,750

You okay? You got it?

417
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,550

All right, thank you.

418
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,130

What are you doing home?

419
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:49,260

‐ So this is the new man? ‐ There's no new man.

420
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,200

We work together at the clinic. I needed his truck.

421
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:57,070

Well, why don't you take your truck and head home?

422
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:59,240

Me and Asta got some catching up to do.

423
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,910

I don't think that's what she had in mind.

424
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,120

It's what I had in mind.

425
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,390

Harry, just‐‐hey, just go. It's fine.

426
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:17,160

We have, actually, a lot to talk about, right? Right?

427
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,990

And I'll come get my things tomorrow.

428
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:22,060

Okay?

429
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,460

‐ Fine. ‐ Okay.

430
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,770

Jesus Christ, Jimmy.

431
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,570

‐ Who is this guy? ‐ Let's go.

432
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,350

Keep driving.

433
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,150

Of course she's in danger.

434
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,550

The guy had a skull on his arm

435
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:49,820

with a snake coming out of its eye socket.

436
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,730

But she's not your problem.

437
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:54,060

Your only problem is you're no closer

438
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,560

to completing the mission than you were four months ago,

439
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,100

so get focused.

440
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,330

No more stupid moves.

441
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,470

Dammit!

442
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:27,090

I'll bring someone home. How about that?

443
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:28,700

You think that's gonna be fun for me?

444
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,130

You want to embarrass me like that?

445
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,070

You know what the funny part is?

446
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,770

I actually came here to forgive you.

447
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:37,140

And I come home to that.

448
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,710

Four months, I come home to that.

449
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,940

Where are you going?

450
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,310

Where do you think you're going?

451
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:42,910

Get back. Hey.

452
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:45,850

I don't want to talk to you.

453
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,620

This is the last time, you understand me?

454
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:51,150

I told you if you did it again, this is what would happen.

455
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,920

You're making me look stupid.

456
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,260

No, you don't need my help.

457
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,390

Let go!

458
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:16,480

Harry!

459
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,980

Stop. Stop.

460
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,280

You're killing him.

461
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,920

Harry, Harry, Harry.

462
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,050

Hey, it's not worth it. Okay? It's not worth it.

463
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,510

Bitch.

464
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:20,710

You gonna tell me how you did that?

465
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,110

Did what?

466
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:30,220

You just dragged a 220‐pound man through a wall.

467
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:33,950

Yoga.

468
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:39,290

Why did you want to come out here?

469
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:10,390

I've always been an outsider.

470
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:12,830

Maybe that's why I understand you.

471
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:20,330

What makes you think I'm an outsider?

472
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:23,870

'Cause wherever you learned to do that stuff back there,

473
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,440

it wasn't around here.

474
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:30,510

You're just different.

475
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,020

I know what that feels like.

476
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:40,950

Sometimes just feeling human is alien to me.

477
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,290

Yeah, me too.

478
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,300

Why would you marry that guy?

479
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:56,870

God knows I've asked myself that question for years.

480
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:02,310

When I was 16, I got pregnant.

481
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:06,150

Jimmy convinced me we were too young to raise a child,

482
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:10,480

so I‐‐I gave the baby up for adoption.

483
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,190

Whenever I got sad about it, he would remind me

484
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:21,960

in his own special way that I did the right thing.

485
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,640

I think I felt like,

486
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,170

if I left him...

487
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:34,870

I gave the baby up for nothing.

488
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:44,050

One day, four months ago,

489
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:46,390

I had enough.

490
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:49,720

I got in my car and never went back.

491
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:06,370

"The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want.

492
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:09,380

"He maketh me lie down in green pastures.

493
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,850

"He leadeth me beside the still waters.

494
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,750

"He restoreth my soul.

495
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:17,050

He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness."

496
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:19,150

Why is everyone in town calling my phone

497
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:22,360

thinking I'm the new town doctor?

498
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:27,230

Well, you know, everyone has the right to medical care.

499
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,730

And as the mayor, it's my job to do what's best

500
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:33,070

for the people of this town. And then that is to fight

501
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:36,200

to make sure that they have a doctor.

502
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,910

Also, I had a standing 4:00 therapy appointment

503
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,910

on Tuesdays with Sam, so...

504
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:45,950

And now you want to talk to me instead?

505
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,450

Well, yeah, I love Kate so much,

506
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:50,980

I just‐‐sometimes when we're screwing,

507
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,190

I don't want to look her in the face.

508
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,790

‐ Okay. ‐ Yeah.

509
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:56,620

I'll see you Tuesday. Okay.

510
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:59,660

"I walk through the valley of the dead...

511
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:02,700

I will fear no evil."

512
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,300

I'm really glad you came.

513
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,300

You're kind of a breath of fresh air in this place.

514
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:14,470

"Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me."

515
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:17,280

Air.

516
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,250

"Thou preparest a table before me..."

517
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:22,220

Where are you going?

518
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,980

"In the presence of mine enemies."

519
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:26,020

Harry. Excuse me.

520
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,320

"Thou anointeth my head with oil..."

521
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,920

I'm so sorry. Excuse me.

522
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,320

"My cup runneth over."

523
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,560

Oh, yeah.

524
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,790

That ain't weird at all.

525
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:36,760

I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Hey, Harry.

526
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,800

What is he doing?

527
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,770

He really misses the doctor.

528
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:43,170

Harry, this is not the time or the place.

529
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:47,270

Has to be now.

530
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:49,180

In an hour, he'll be underground with the worms.

531
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,350

Mm! So intense. I like it.

532
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:54,510

But not for everybody.

533
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:58,250

Harry. I'm so sorry. Keep praying. I'm sorry.

534
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:01,350

"Unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul."

535
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:05,020

‐ I know how he died. ‐ What?

536
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:07,660

His windpipe‐‐he needed air.

537
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,700

It's the only thing that would explain what happened.

538
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:20,840

He tried to give himself a tracheotomy.

539
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,410

He couldn't do it in time.

540
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,510

Yeah.

541
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:30,020

That makes sense, but I don't get it.

542
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,150

Why would his throat close up?

543
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:34,320

Because Sam Hodges was poisoned.

544
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:39,430

And one of the people here is the murderer.

545
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,760

Clung‐clung!

546
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,830

Humans are dangerous.

547
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:50,240

My people have always known that.

548
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:58,040

My mission was simple:

549
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:01,580

Drop my device onto their planet and head back home.

550
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:16,700

I had no intentions of getting close to any of them.

551
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,400

Don't you walk away from me!

552
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,430

Don't tell me what to do!

553
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:59,270

Come on! Asta, come on!

554
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:00,270

I'm sorry.

555
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:52,760

I was taught that the biggest problem

556
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:57,530

with the human race was their need for connection.

557
00:43:57,530 --> 00:44:01,370

We always saw that as a weakness.

558
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:07,170

But now I realize it may be their greatest strength.

559
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:14,580

In 1884, the local mine caved in.

560
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:16,050

When the miners escaped,

561
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:18,950

they realized there was one man still trapped.

562
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:21,890

There's still one in there.

563
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:24,790

59 men went back into the compromised mine,

564
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:27,790

risking their own lives to save him.

565
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:36,740

59 died to save one.

566
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:53,990

Maybe there's something redeemable

567
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:57,660

about the human race after all.

568
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:01,060

Unfortunately for them, it's too late.

569
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:03,200

It's only a matter of time before I find

570
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,700

the rest of my device,

571
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:09,240

and when I do, I can finally complete my mission

572
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,740

and kill them all.

573
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:15,410

Every single one of them.

574
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:18,080

Yeah, thanks, bye.

575
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,110

Hi, Harry.

576
00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:21,710

Hi.

577
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:28,550

You okay?

578
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:36,300

Yeah.

579
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:42,670

You have a patient in the exam room.

580
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,320

Yeah.

581
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,890

This is some bullshit.
