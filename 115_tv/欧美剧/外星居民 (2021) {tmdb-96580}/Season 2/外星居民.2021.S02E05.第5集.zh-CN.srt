是阿斯塔的女儿
That's Asta's daughter.

21
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,190
这是个大秘密  并且如果被揭露
That's a really big secret, and it's gonna hurt

22
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,570
会伤害很多人
a lot of people when it comes out.

23
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,650
放手
Let go!

24
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,270
我以为没有我她会过得更好
I thought she'd be better off without me,

25
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,260
但如果不是那样呢
but what if that's not true?

26
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,030
住手  他不值得
Stop! He's not worth it.

27
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,870
如果她应该和我在一起呢
What if she's supposed to be with me?

28
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,240
-我听说他们发现了一具尸体  -不  只有一只脚
- I hear they found a body.  - No, just a foot.

有具尸体还没找到
There's a dead body out there somewhere,

30
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,430
我们找不到就誓不罢休
and we're not gonna rest until we find it.

31
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,300
我儿子麦克斯告诉我你是外星人
My son Max told me you're an alien.

32
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,480
坦白说  他快把我逼疯了
Frankly, he is driving me crazy.

33
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,290
我相信你  我有个计划
I believe you. I've got a plan.

34
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:40,310
有人吗

00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,350
-看看这个   -不
- Check this out.  - No!

36
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,580
你是怎么进来的
How did you get in here?

37
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,040
我有钥匙
I have a key.

38
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,660
我仍然是你的妻子
I am still your wife.

39
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,540
{\an8}五年前
纽约市

40
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:01,030
哈里用组织样本来追踪感染
Harry used the tissue samples to track back the infection

41
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,800
发现其来自患者人工主动脉瓣的涂层
to the coating on the patient's artificial aortic valve.

42
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,830
-干得太棒了  哈利  -谢谢
- It was amazing work, Harry.  - Thank you.

43
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:08,100
只要不是我自己的心脏就好
I'm great with the heart as long as it's not my own.

44
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,110
失陪
Excuse me.

45
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,060
当然
Yes, of course.

46
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,060
你能帮帮我吗  不好意思
Hi, can you help me? I'm sorry.

47
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,180
你觉得这幅画在表达什么
What do you think this painting is saying?

48
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,670
我其实正在努力不去想它
I'm rather trying not to think about it, actually.

49
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,350
但是我觉得...
But I'd say...

50
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,210
它让我觉得有点上下颠倒
makes me feel a bit upside down.

51
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,960
上下颠倒
Upside down.

52
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,850
你有什么感觉
What's it make you feel?

53
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,090
我不知道
I don't know.

54
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,770
但我喜欢谜团
But I love the mystery.

55
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,340
好吧
Right.

56
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,800
很有趣
That's very interesting.

57
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,290
你真的应该和作者分享这种解读
You really ought to share that interpretation with the artist.

58
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,060
那就是我
Oh, that's me.

59
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,660
我是伊莎贝尔
Hi, I'm Isabelle.

61
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,830
但我还以为你是女服务员
But I thought you were the waitress.

62
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,960
我在潜伏
I'm undercover.

63
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,450
我是女服务员  那你是谁
I'll be the waitress.Who will you be?

64
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,610
我是离婚的医生...

65
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,480
也在潜伏

我是个艺术爱好者
I'm an art afficionado.

67
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,870
作为一个艺术爱好者  你对此有何看法
As an art afficionado, what do you say about this?

68
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:24,940
我喜欢这幅画

-斯本格 -斯本格

73
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,630
可惜有个混蛋出价比你高
Unfortunately, some bastard has outbid you.

74
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,880
一个混蛋出价比我高
A bastard outbid me?

75
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,360
-的确如此  -混蛋

我得搞定它

00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:45,560
等等
Hold on.

一万
$10,000.

79
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,580
我是说  这是有原因的
I mean, it's for a good cause.

80
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,010
是的
Right.

00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,210
的确
Indeed.

82
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,860
那我可不能错过

83
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,250
我想解开这个谜团

人类有一种奇怪的行为

00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,740
他们称之为"扯淡的艺术"

92
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,940
{\an8}现在

93
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,130
那个小杂种麦克斯就是扯淡界的米开朗基罗

你想假装是我的朋友
You want to pretend to be my friend

96
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,400
然后偷了我的钥匙闯进我的小屋

97
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:08,680
没问题

你刚才没检查壁橱吗
You didn't check the closet?

105
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,750
看看里面有没有我们熟睡的儿子吗

没有  我没有检查壁橱或袜子抽屉
No, I didn't check the closet or the sock drawers.

他有时会在这里露营
He camps out in here sometimes.

108
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,840
你一定是睡着了

好了  我需要知道
All right, now, I'm gonna need to know

113
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,270
男孩的血型

114
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,440
还需要一个头发样本
and I'm gonna need a hair sample.

115
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,490
我们要乐观  但要做好最坏的准备
We gonna hope for the best but be prepared for the worst.

116
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,430
副警长  你上去他的房间收集指纹
Now, Deputy, you go up, and you dust his room for prints.

117
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,430
告诉我  上次见到那个男孩还活着
Now, tell me, when was the last time

118
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,610

119
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,990
麦克斯闹乌龙了
Well, so, funny story about Max.

120
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,390
他刚才在壁橱里
He was in the closet.

121
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,150
你在开玩笑吗
Are you kidding me?

122
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,730
妈的  我还为了这事刮了车上的冰
Shit, I scraped ice off the truck for this?

123
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,520
事实上  是我刮的
Actually, I scraped the ice.

124
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,850
很抱歉把你拖到这里来
Yeah, we're really sorry to drag you out here.

125
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,450
然后趁他喝咖啡的时候给车里开暖了空调
Then I warmed up the car while he finished his coffee.

126
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,660
你不如给你儿子系条绳子
Look, you might want to tie a rope

127
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,520
这样他就不会丢了
around your boy so you don't lose him.

128
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,680
你知道吗  我今天看到他骑自行车
You know I caught him riding his bike

129
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,460
沿着16号公路出城
way out on Route 16 today?

130
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,970
什么  麦克斯  是真的吗
What? Max, is that true?

131
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,010
你知道我们不允许你
You know you're not allowed

132
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,350
骑自行车离家那么远的
to ride your bike that far from home.

133
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,710
你被禁足一年
You are grounded for a year.

134
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,990
-亲爱的  -一天
- Honey.  - A day?

135
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,420
你不能让我禁足  我有充分的理由
You can't ground me! I had a good reason!

136
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,830
是得有点理由
This should be something.

137
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,820
如果我儿子说他有充分的理由
Hey, if my son says he has a good reason,

138
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,760
那他肯定没说谎  说吧  麦克斯
he had a good reason. Go ahead, Max.

139
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,040
谢谢你  妈妈
Thank you, Mother.

140
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,810
我得趁万德斯本格医生工作的时候
I had to break in to Dr. Vanderspeigle's house

141
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,330
-闯进他的家  -等等  什么

接受道歉
Apology accepted.

143
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,430
你们家教的
What type of criminal mastermind

144
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,080
这是什么犯罪主谋啊
you are raising in this house, huh?

145
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,770
我找到了证据能证明他是外星人
I found proof that he's an alien!

146
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,200
是吗  什么样的证据
Oh, really? What kind of proof?

147
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:49,730
比如...飞行的球体  或是...
Like, uh, flying orbs or a loss of, uh...

148
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,340

他的地下室有外星人的科技
He has alien technology in his basement!

150
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,550
麦克斯  你不能再说谎了
Max, you have to stop lying.

151
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,720
我没说谎  萨哈尔也在
I'm not lying! Sahar was there!

152
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,160
她都看到了
She saw everything!

153
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,520
我不记得看到了什么
I don't remember seeing anything.

154
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,850
什么
What?

155
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,790
我记得在骑车  但...

156
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,380
我不记得去过医生的小屋
I don't remember going to the doctor's cabin.

157
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,300
对不起  麦克斯
I'm sorry, Max.

158
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,340
你还没走
You're still here.

159
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,900
你不能穿那个
You can't wear that.

160
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,290
那是男人的衣服
That is a man's shirt!

161
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,030
我飞了大半个国家来找你谈谈
I flew across the country to talk to you,

162
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,480
而你却转身开车走了
and you left and drove away.

163
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,530
你去哪了
Where did you go?

164
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,580
买牛奶
To get milk.

165
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:39,770
那牛奶呢
So where's the milk?

166
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,500
我喝了
I drank it.

167
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,450
她在扫描我
She's scanning me.

168
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,320
幸好我没杀了那两个孩子
It's a good thing I didn't murder those kids.

169
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,980
不然一裤子都得是血
There'd be blood all over my pants.

170
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,480
那我就只能把她也杀了
And then I'd have to murder her.

171
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,560
对  我做了正确的决定
Yes. I made the right choice.

172
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,420
这是我的强项
I'm very good at this.

173
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,220
你有什么不一样了
What's different about you?

174
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,620
我刮了胡子
I shaved my mustache.

175
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,000
你以前也不留胡子
You didn't have a mustache.

176
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,160
长出来了  然后我给刮了
I grew it, and then I shaved it...

177
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,440
刮完才喝的牛奶
before I drank the milk.

178
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,670
你嗑药了吗
Are you high?

179
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,980
对
Yes.

180
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:10,610
我抽了超强效的大麻
I am high on the skunk's...weed.

181
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,400
我非常生你的气
I'm very cross with you.

182
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,280
你那语气就像詹姆斯·邦德
You sound like James Bond.

183
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,440
非常生你的气
Very cross with you.

184
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,500
我非常生你的气
I'm very cross with you.

185
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,410
我都准备好签离婚协议了
I was ready to sign the divorce papers,

186
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,700
而你却拖了律师们好几个月
and then you stonewalled the lawyers for months.

187
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,650
电话  邮件  短信  通通不回
Phone calls, emails, texts, all unanswered.

188
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,310
我不知道你有没有收到
I don't know if you saw any of them.

189
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,560
这完全是精神折磨
This has been absolute emotional torture.

190
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:35,990
如果你准备好离婚了
If you're ready to have a divorce,

191
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,390
就把字签了
just sign the papers!

192
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,360
谢谢
Thank you.

193
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,750
你还签得真痛快啊
wow, that was so easy for you.

194
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,240
42号出口有家汽车旅馆
There's a motel at Exit 42.

195
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,460
而这起居室里有个混蛋
And there's an asshole in the living room.

196
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,050
我还以为我们至少能像正常人一样好好谈谈
I thought we could at least talk about this like humans.

197
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,670
那是我睡觉的地方
That's where I sleep.

198
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,640
这是什么情况
What's happening here?

199
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,490
她明明同意了结束关系
She agreed to end the relationship;

200
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,760
我都白纸黑字写下来了
I've got it in writing.

201
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,410
别动  别发出声响
Don't move. Don't make a sound.

202
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,960
你就装死  可能她就会放手了
Just play dead, and maybe she'll let go.

203
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,900
说实话  感觉还不赖
Actually, this isn't bad.

204
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,140
她很温暖  就像块巨大的火腿肉
She's warm, like a giant ham.

205
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,630
也许我终究还是能睡着的
Maybe I can sleep after all.

206
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,560
该死
Shit.

207
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:58,920
早啊  亲爱的
Morning, love.

208
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,650
几点了  闹钟...
What time is it? The alarm...

209
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,810
我给关了
Oh, I turned it off.

210
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,570
我想着咱们可以休息一下
I thought we could use the rest.

211
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,490
-我得走了  -什么  那我们什么时候谈
- I have to go.  - What? When are we gonna talk?

212
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,540
我们刚谈过了
We just did.

213
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,670
现在我得去工作了
Now I have to go to my job.

214
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,090
你什么时候在佩西恩斯找了份工作
Since when have you got a job in Patience?

215
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,600
镇医被人杀了
The town doctor was murdered.

216
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,120
现在我是镇医了  因为我是活人
Now I am the town doctor because I am alive.

217
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,350
你在老家不干医生了
You've abandoned your practice back home,

218
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:30,680
却跑到科罗拉多州扮演救死扶伤医生
and now you're in Colorado playing Dr. Fix-it?

219
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,040
他们只叫我万德斯本格医生
They just call me Dr. Vanderspeigle.

220
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:34,600
再见
Goodbye.

221
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,180
你回家之前  把垃圾带出去
Before you go home, take out the trash.

222
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,660
我很注重回收
I recycle.

223
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,890
我很生气
I am angry.

224
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,670
我应该早起  现在应该已经在山上
I was supposed to be up early and already on the mountain

225
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,080
寻找我的设备了
to search for my device.

226
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,950
那女人让我分心了
That woman is a distraction.

227
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,260
为什么这种生物会选择
Why do these creatures choose to spend their lives

228
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,600
跟别人一起生活
with someone else?

229
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,540
他们在各自的家庭里
It's bad enough they're already tethered

230
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,950
就已经很难互相容忍了
to each other through family.

231
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,030
我的族人对待家庭的方式就很正确
My people do family the right way.

232
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,890
我们不在乎彼此是死是活
We don't care if they live or die.

233
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,780
一粒白的一粒红的  就着鸡蛋吃
Take one white one and one red one with your eggs.

234
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,150
这黄黄的东西叫鸡蛋吗
Is that what they call these yellow things?

235
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,160
看起来就像大鸟在这盘子里爆炸了
Looks like Big Bird exploded on this plate.

236
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,360
要不是因为你  我们这会都在嗡嗡家
Wasn't for you, we'd be eating

237
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,950
吃半熏的香肠了
those half-moke sausages at Bee-bee's.

238
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,600
我知道这里不是华盛顿  但...
Yeah, I know, it's not exactly D. C., but...

239
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,040
山里的空气对你有好处
the mountain air out here is good for you.

240
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,780
是为了这个吗
Oh, is that what we're going with?

241
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,910
所以我们来了这里吗
Is that why we're here?

242
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:32,080
是啊  搬来这里都怪我
Yeah, blame moving out here on me,

243
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,520
反正什么事都怪我
just like you blame me for everything else.

244
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,620
可能山姆被杀也是我的错
Probably my fault Sam got killed, too.

245
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,380
那案子破了吗  麦克
You crack that one yet, Mikey?

246
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:45,650
我猜也没有
Didn't think so.

247
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:49,380
看来山姆死错了镇子
Looks like Sam chose the wrong town to die in.

248
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,110
你...
You just...

249
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,740
该死
Shit!

250
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,270
你到底怎么回事
What's wrong with you?

251
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,280
这些人居然放心让你带着枪
And these people trust you with a gun.

252
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:57,850
对不起  爸爸
I'm sorry, Dad.

253
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,450
求你把药吃了好吗
Can you just take your pills, please?

254
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,180
好好好
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

255
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,210
哈里
Harry!

256
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,440
怎么了  在里面抓浣熊吗
What's going on? Chasing a raccoon in there?

257
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:15,450
我没事
I'm fine.

258
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,120
没有浣熊
There is no racoon.

259
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,880
我只是在穿裤子
I'm just putting on my pants.

260
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:24,360
不是吧
Oh, shit.

261
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,620
你住在你的卡车上吗
Are you living in your truck?

262
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,400
没什么好羞耻的
Hey, it's nothing to be ashamed of.

263
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,420
我每周有三天会睡在59号  我懂的
I...I sleep at the 59, like, three nights a week, so I get it.

264
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,850
我没住在卡车上
I'm not living in my truck.

265
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,280
我...
Oh, I...

266
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,680
我确实睡在59号
I do sleep at the 59.

267
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,320
这咖啡是给我的吗
Is that coffee for me?

268
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:43,120
你是说我没递给你的这杯咖啡吗
Oh, this coffee that I have not offered to you in any way?

269
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:44,940
不是给你的
No.

270
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,250
总之  很高兴遇见你  因为
Anyway, glad I ran into you because, um...

271
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,620
我们很愉快  我们接吻过
you know, we had fun, and we kissed,

272
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,610
那感觉  很有趣
which was...interesting.

273
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:01,000
但我觉得是时候
But I i kind of think we shouldn't drag this whole

274
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,560
把话说清楚了
"Will they, won't they" thing out more than we need to.

275
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,620
我不想再和你约会了
I don't want to date you anymore.

276
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,640
我能嗦一口吗
Can I just have a sip?

277
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,830
-这能帮助我排便  -好吧
- It will help me move my bowels. - Okay.

278
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,850
我知道你此刻很受伤
No, I can see that you're hurting,

279
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,570
也很理解
and I get it.

280
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,440
我们能做朋友  只是
We can be friends, I just it's just...

281
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,070
你不是我的菜
You're just not my type.

282
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,620
就是说  这世上最聪明
So your type is not the smartest

283
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,700
最好的男人不是你的菜
and the best person in the world.

284
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:25,950
看吧
See, there it is.

285
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,120
你的这种自恋
I think it's just your ego.

286
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,590
就像
It's...

287
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,370
我甚至都不知道该怎么形容
I don't even know how to describe it.

288
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,030
看来你不是很聪明
So you're not very smart?

289
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,380
我他...你说什么
what the...?Did you just say to me?

290
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,600
糟了  人类男人不能对女人太刻薄
Oh, no. Human men must not say mean things to women.

291
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,920
如果不道歉  她会发现我是外星人
If I don't apologize, she'll know I'm an alien.

292
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,720
刚刚太刻薄了
That was mean.

293
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,490
我不该那样说的
I should not have said that.

294
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:51,650
没错
Yeah.

295
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,200
我是男人  一个人类男人  你很聪明
I am a man, a human man, and you are smart,

296
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,620
相对于
relative to...

297
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,310
我们种族来说
our species.

298
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,180
再见
Goodbye.

299
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,810
混蛋
Asshole!

300
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,230
你这个渣男竟然骗我
You lying, cheating bastard.

301
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,980
{\an8}山姆·霍奇斯病人档案

302
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,640
你好  万德斯本格医生
Oh, hello, Dr. Vanderspeigle.

303
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,210
没想到你还在这儿
I'm surprised you're still here.

304
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,970
霍索恩镇长还没找到替代我的医生
Mayor Hawthorne hasn't found my replacement yet

305
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,790
因为他办事效率低
because he's bad at his job.

306
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,010
这些是山姆的私人医疗档案
Well, these are Sam's private medical files.

307
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,460
我想你可能会需要
I thought you might want them.

308
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:16,840
不用了
No.

309
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:18,970
不过好吧
But okay.

310
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,630
既然我都在这儿了
You know, since I'm here,

311
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:23,440
请问你完成山姆的尸检报告了吗
can I ask if you've finished Sam's autopsy report?

312
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,490
我得等到丹佛实验室那边的
I can't until I get the toxicology results

313
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,920
毒物检测结果才能知道
back from the lab in Denver.

314
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,770
听到他自杀了  我真的很伤心
So sad to find out he committed suicide.

315
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:33,060
他是被谋杀  就没什么好伤心的了
Because if he was murdered, it would not be so sad.

316
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,080
如果是自杀
Well, if he committed suicide,

317
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,870
将无法获得保险赔付
his insurance claim would be null and void.

318
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,160
我只能指望你了  医生  做正确的事吧
So I'm counting on you, Doctor, to do the right thing.

319
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,860
你需要剪剪头发了
You know, you could use a haircut.

320
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,170
不如到楼下的美发店坐坐
Why don't you come down to the salon?

321
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,280
我亲自给你造型
I'll cut it for you.

322
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,110
我都自己剪
I cut my own hair.

323
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:51,720
看得出来
I see that.

324
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,760
你俩说什么呢
What was that about?

325
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,810
她支持谋杀
She's pro-murder.

326
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:03,460
并且她希望你把这个盒子
And she wanted you to take this box

327
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,410
和其他死人的盒子放一块儿
to where the other dead people boxes go.

328
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,030
行吧
Okay, then.

329
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:13,120
霍奇斯太太带来的  我不知道该放哪里
Mrs. Hodges brought this. I don't know where to put it.

330
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,360
还有  我妈妈很感激
Also, my mom wanted to thank you

331
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,430
那晚你帮我的事
for helping me out the other night.

332
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,610
她想邀请你吃晚餐
She wants to make you dinner.

333
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,140
这很棒  她不用这么客气的
That's nice. She doesn't have to do that.

334
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,390
我们能详细聊聊
we can talk about that.

335
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,530
我先把这盒子放好
So I'm gonna take this box.

336
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,510
我有麻烦了
I have a problem.

337
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,480
我也是  这盒子甩不掉了
So do I. That box keeps following me.

338
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,710
我搞砸了
I messed up.

339
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,630
我就不该带杰伊来这里
I never should've brought Jay here.

340
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:39,260
她很无辜
She's just so innocent.

341
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,510
根本不知道实情
Walking around, not knowing the truth.

342
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,240
告诉她你是她亲妈
Tell her you're her mother.

343
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,780
是我丢弃了她
I gave her up.

344
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:48,030
我现在不能因为私心就这样要回她
I can't just drag her back now that it suits me.

345
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,790
她有自己的生活和家庭
She has a life and a family.

346
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,760
得等她自己想知道真相
You know, knowing the truth should be on her terms

347
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:53,870
等她准备好了
when she's ready.

348
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,500
杰伊不能再待在这儿了
Jay should not be here.

349
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:56,770
真有趣
This is interesting.

350
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:59,880
她想把杰伊送走是因为她爱她
She's willing to send Jay away because she loves her,

351
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,310
而不是因为讨厌她
not because she hates her.

352
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,480
炒了她
Fire her.

353
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,600
不行
No.

354
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,020
我不能这样做
I can't do that.

355
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,040
那我能吗
Can I?

356
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,570
不过
Although...

357
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,770
她快结课了
her class is almost over.

358
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,810
我能保证她取得个好成绩
I could make sure she gets a good grade.

359
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,790
哈里
Harry.

360
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,430
哈里
Harry.

361
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:17,570
这条围巾是谁的
Whose scarf is this?

362
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,110
我面前这女人吗
Girl up front? This woman?

363
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:23,130
什么"这女人"
Excuse me. "This woman"?

364
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,920
哈里  请告诉你的女朋友
Harry, why don't you tell your girlfriend

365
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,230
这里是医生办公室
that this is a doctor's office

366
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,510
她不能就这样闯进来
and she cannot barge into an exam room?

367
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,970
我可不是女朋友
I'm not his girlfriend.

368
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,060
我是他老婆
I'm his wife.

369
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,900
老婆
His wife?

370
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,460
哈里跟我说过你早死了
Harry here told me you were dead.

371
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,920
我对你来说是死了是吗  哈里
Do I look dead to you, Harry?

372
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,940
那死人会这样吗
Would a dead person do this?

373
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:47,900
或这样
Or that?

374
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,880
对不住  那么
Ooh, I'm so sorry. All right, then.

375
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,880
那这怕不是见鬼了
Ooh, and this must be a ghost.

376
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,840
你也死了  我们都死了
You're dead, too. I guess we're all dead.

377
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:54,530
都死了
Dead!

378
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,520
抱歉  对了
Wow, sorry. Um, right.

379
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,140
你就是个恶魔
You're a monster.

380
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,900
我要回纽约
I I I'm going back to New York.

381
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,960
我不能
I I can't.

382
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,960
"恶魔"是个奶酪牌子吗
"Monster" Is a cheese, right?

383
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,680
来杯你们这儿最烈的酒
Can I have a glass of your driest white, please?

384
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,700
我们这儿从万圣节开始
Well, we've been using the same box of wine

385
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,020
就用的同一种酒  所以
as a stepladder since Halloween, so...

386
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,610
威士忌  你的最佳选择
whiskey... That's your best bet.

387
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:25,660
天
Oh, dear.

388
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,630
幸运的是
And you're in luck.

389
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,580
现在还算特价早餐时间
Still in time for the breakfast special,

390
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,020
如果你想  还能加个蛋进去
if you want me to crack an egg into it.

391
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,870
我是在离婚中
I am going through a divorce,

392
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:36,250
但我还没到需要"威士忌加生鸡蛋"的程度
but I'm not quite at "Egg in my whiskey" phase yet.

393
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,150
离婚  那的确不简单  我理解
Divorce. That's rough. I hear ya.

394
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,660
你离婚了吗
You're divorced?

395
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,420
不  还没有
Oh, no. Not yet, anyway.

396
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,060
有朝一日会的
You know, someday.

397
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,990
我还处于离婚前
Still kind of working on that pre-divorce part.

398
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:48,900
别费心了
Don't bother.

399
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,460
上帝  人们都是怎么...
Ah, God. How do people...

400
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,430
真是出其不意
Really sneaks up on you.

401
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:56,960
没错  就像是中风一样
Yeah. It's like a stroke.

402
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:00,860
我就是不明白一个人怎么可以有如此大的转变
I just don't understand how people can change so much.

403
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:04,890
他以前非常有活力而且善于展示自己
He used to be so alive and present,

404
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,750
而现在他  很迟钝
and now he's, like, blunt.

405
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,800
我懂迟钝的家伙
I know blunt guys.

406
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,020
我交往的那个人  就好像
Yeah, the guy I'm dating, it's like,

407
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,160
他很直率  这点很与众不同
he's so direct, you know, which is refreshing.

408
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,360
有点性感  但是
It's kind of hot, but...

409
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,710
有时就  就真的很无情
Sometimes it's... it's really brutal.

410
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,690
完全正确  上帝  他们都是一个样
Exactly. God, they're all the same.

411
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:23,480
-可能是同一个人呢  -或许  有两个他
- Probably dating the same guy. - Maybe there's two of them.

412
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,070
你可真能想象
Can you imagine?

413
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,230
不好意思  我以为你是我的老婆
I'm sorry. I thought you were my wife.

414
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,800
麦克斯有些事想跟你说
Max has something he would like to tell you.

415
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,320
说吧  麦克斯
Go ahead, Max.

416
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,050
我为了溜进你的小屋 偷了你的钥匙
I stole your keys and made a copy of them

417
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,360
并重新配了一副
to sneak into your cabin.

418
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:45,460
什么
What?

419
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:49,240
我对这个控告感到十分惊恐
I am horrified at this accusation!

420
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,710
不  他没有指控你什么
Oh, no, he didn't accuse you of anyth...

421
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,260
我不接受你的道歉
I don't accept your apology!

422
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,920
他还没有道歉
Well, he hasn't apologized yet.

423
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,500
我说的有点超前了
I'm getting ahead of myself.

424
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,640
麦克斯  继续说把
Max. Go on.

425
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,450
对不起
I'm sorry.

426
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:02,880
很好
Good.

427
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,620
现在  我  不接受你的道歉
Now I...do not accept your apology!

428
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,270
你  你必须得接受
Well, you... You have to accept it.

429
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,200
为什么
Why?

430
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,440
这是条例规定的
Those are the rules.

431
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:16,740
那他不是真的抱歉  所以我不接受这次道歉
Well, he's not really sorry, so I'm not accepting it.

432
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,220
万德斯本格医生说得没错
Dr. Vanderspeigle is right.

433
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,160
麦克斯
Max

434
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,610
真心说出你的歉意
say it like you mean it.

435
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:22,800
但是我并不是真心的
But I don't mean it!

436
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,660
你的行为愚弄不了我  外星人
Your act doesn't fool me, alien.

437
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,460
我知道你在你的地下室里发现了我们
I know you found us in your basement

438
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,860
然后用某种手段偷偷地把我们送回家
and somehow snuck us home.

439
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:31,180
我感觉我被攻击了  我很敏感的
I'm feeling attacked. I am snowflaking.

440
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,180
麦克斯  够了
Max, that's...that's enough.

441
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,800
你看到我们的情况了吧  万德斯本格医生
Do you see what we're dealing with, Dr. Vanderspeigle?

442
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,620
他就是不肯放下
He just won't let up.

443
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,660
我有个办法
I have an idea.

444
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,990
他们很显然疼爱这个孩子
They obviously love this kid.

445
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,010
我不确定为什么
I'm not sure why.

446
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,650
他是个威胁
He's a menace.

447
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,760
我从阿斯塔那学到爱
I learned a lesson from Asta about love.

448
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,010
它可以被用做武器
It can be used as a weapon.

449
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,140
好了  麦克斯
Okay, Max.

450
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,610
我将给你做一个简单的测试
I'm going to give you a simple test.

451
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,350
这些人中  哪一个是我
Which one of these people... is me?

452
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,260
你知道我没法这样辨认出你
You know I can't tell by this.

453
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,320
如果这里有一个恶心的外星人的照片
If there was a picture of a gross alien

454
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,280
或是个愚蠢的鼻涕虫  我很愿意指出来
or a dumb slug, I'd point to it.

455
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,610
-真伤人  -麦克斯
- Hurtful. - Max.

456
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,430
请别再瞎胡闹了
Please stop fooling around.

457
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,490
这是很严肃的
This is serious.

458
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:09,430
行吧
Fine.

459
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,700
-这个人  -不
- This one! - No!

460
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,120
别再耍把戏了  小兄弟  那个是罗素·克劳
Enough games, buddy. That's Russell Crowe.

461
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,270
不对  那个是山姆·尼尔
No, that's Sam Neill.

462
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,300
不  他是那个澳大利亚人
No, the Australian guy

463
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,900
演过一个关于数学天才的电影
from the genius movie with the math.

464
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,900
-不对  我保证  不是的  -好了
- No, I promise you, it's not... - Hey!

465
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:20,690
够了
Snap out of it!

466
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,340
麦克斯指错了
Max got it wrong.

467
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,970
甜心  他是谁
Sweetie, who is this?

468
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,720
-你认不出来他吗  -不
- Don't you recognize him? - No!

469
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:31,860
我这辈子从没见过这个男人
I've never seen that man before in my entire life.

470
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,120
我原谅你
I forgive you

471
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,760
闯入我的房子  麦克斯
for breaking into my house, Max.

472
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:35,540
我原谅你
I forgive you

473
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:38,630
因为你是一个生病了的小孩
because you are a sick little boy.

474
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,510
而且  她说对了  他是山姆·尼尔
And she's right. It's Sam Neill!

475
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:45,610
他演过侏罗纪恐龙纪录片
From the Jurassic-era dinosaur documentary!

476
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:47,060
-我  -他在说谎
- I... - He's lying!

477
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,990
他给我设了套  他在骗你
He's setting me up! He's tricking you!

478
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,740
他根本不是真的医生
He's not even a real doctor!

479
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,880
-麦克斯  -我玩得很开心
- Max. - Well, this has been fun.

480
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,310
我赶紧从窗户跳出去好了
I'm just gonna go jump out a window real quick.

481
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,270
麦克斯
Max.

482
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,040
这比我想的还要严重
It's worse than I thought.

483
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,890
他很显然
He obviously suffers

484
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:05,430
患有严重的"怪兽恐惧症"
from a severe case of teraphobia.

485
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,310
怪兽恐惧症
Teraphobia?

486
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,790
总是看见怪物或是其他可怕的东西
Seeing monsters and other scary things.

487
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:14,530
这是你最需要担心的
If you worry about one thing, it should be that.

488
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:15,460
另外
Also...

489
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,180
他可能患有脸盲症
he might suffer from face blindness

490
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,770
和焦虑症
and anxiety...

491
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,490
而且  参考你的头骨
and looking at your skull...

492
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,500
他有可能还会发际线后移
he's probably gonna have a receding hairline.

493
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,400
这太可怕了
This is horrible.

494
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,400
如果怪兽恐惧症没有加以治疗
If teraphobia is untreated,

495
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,900
麦克斯就会有很严重的问题
Max can have severe issues,

496
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,160
一生都没有多少头发可不是什么趣事
and going through life without hair is no fun.

497
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:37,580
但是
But...

498
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:41,600
有一所特殊学校
there is a special school

499
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,570
{\an8}唐纳利学院

500
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,650
针对像麦克斯这样的小孩
for kids like Max...

501
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,520
在佐治亚州
in Georgia.

502
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,620
佐治亚州
Georgia?

503
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,230
{\an8}唐纳利学院

504
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,610
我们只需要一个确凿的证据[冒烟的枪]
We just need a smoking gun.

505
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,310
我们没有找到烟  甚至  我们连枪都没找到
We ain't got no smoke. Hell, we ain't even got a gun.

506
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,610
我询问了所有可能的目击证人
I interviewed every possible witness,

507
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,860
我也检查了所有证物  我
and I examined all the evidence. I...

508
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,820
你现在在逗我玩吗
Are you shitting me right now?

509
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,340
你在玩悠悠球吗
Are you playing with a yoyo?

510
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,130
抱歉  长官  它  它能让我冷静
Sorry, sir. It, uh...it calms me.

511
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,330
我也需要冷静  把它给我
Well, I need to be calm. Give me this.

512
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:24,250
没有可能的嫌疑人
Got no viable suspects.

513
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,790
没有动机  我们什么都没有
We got no motive. We got nothing!

514
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,000
该死  我们甚至还不能确定
Hell, we don't even know for sure yet

515
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,250
他是否是被谋杀的
if he was even murdered!

516
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,160
真棒  你把它弄坏了
Great, you broke it.

517
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,400
长官  山姆不像是会自杀的人
Sir, Sam doesn't seem the suicide type.

518
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,720
我觉得他是被谋杀的
I think he was murdered,

519
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,790
我也认为那和湖里的脚有关
and I really do think it's somehow related to the foot in the lake.

520
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,240
别管那只脚了
You know what? Screw that foot.

521
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,300
据我们所知  那玩意是从北边顺流而下的
For all we know, that thing floated downriver from up north.

522
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,070
现在甘尼森可能有个一只脚的混蛋
There's probably some one-footed sumbitch up in Gunnison,

523
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:56,500
正单脚跳着嘲笑我们呢
hopping around, laughing at our asses right now.

524
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,640
我不觉得他还能笑得出来
I don't think he laughs much.

525
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,010
我以为有连环杀手时  太开心了
I was so happy when I thought we had a serial killer.

526
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,080
感觉很棒
It felt good.

527
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,410
看看这些街道
I mean, look at these streets!

528
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:10,950
一点也不危险  漂亮极了
They're not mean! They're beautiful!

529
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,870
你知道科罗拉多斯普林斯
You know how many violent crimes

530
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:15,400
去年有多少起暴力犯罪吗
Colorado Springs had last year, hmm?

531
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,130
超过五百起
Over 500.

532
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:18,730
五百
500!

533
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,860
幸运的混蛋们
Lucky bastards.

534
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:24,600
别灰心  长官  明天是宾果之夜[猜数字游戏]
Cheer up, sir. Tomorrow is bingo night.

535
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,470
拉贝勒太太说不定又会突然开始揍神父
Maybe Mrs. Labelle will sucker‐punch the priest again.

536
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:30,110
她比西葫芦蛋糕还疯狂
Yeah, she is crazier than zucchini cake.

537
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:30,950
是啊
Yeah.

538
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,740
其实她是我姨妈
Actually, s‐she is my aunt.

539
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:35,230
好吧  那也不能在蛋糕里放蔬菜
Okay. Still shouldn't put vegetables in cake.

540
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,050
那样不对
It's wrong.

541
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,530
我们是聪明有魅力的独立女性
We're smart, attractive, independent women.

542
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,670
不需要什么臭男人决定我们的未来
We don't need some guy to determine our future.

543
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:45,670
我们很坚强
We are strong!

544
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:47,350
我们很坚强  我们无所畏惧
We're strong. And we're fearless!

545
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,870
你无所畏惧
You are fearless!

546
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:49,810
说的太对了
Damn right.

547
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,330
除了这个家伙
Except about this guy.

548
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,820
我觉得你和他分手
I think you broke up with him

549
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,650
是因为你害怕受到伤害
because you were afraid of getting hurt.

550
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,140
你是这么想的吗
You think so?

551
00:23:58,910 --> 00:23:59,470
我还以为是因为
'Cause I thought it was 'cause

552
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,680
他接吻就像马吃甜筒冰淇淋
he kissed like a horse eating an ice cream cone.

553
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,950
实在抱歉
I'm so sorry.

554
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:08,520
-每个真男人都会爱上你的  -是啊
- Any real man would be in love with you. - Yeah.

555
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,950
相信我这个艺术家
Take it from an artist.

556
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,150
没有风险  就没有收获
Without risk, there's nothing.

557
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:12,970
确实
Yeah.

558
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:14,710
真正的女人不会逃避
Real women don't run away.

559
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:15,680
没错
That's right.

560
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,130
我们不逃避
We don't run away.

561
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:20,940
因为我们很坚强  因为我们互相支持
Because we're strong because we support each other.

562
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,800
没错
Right.

563
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,650
你见到丹尼了吗
Have you seen Danny?

564
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,940
白天就喝得醉醺醺  修点歌机的丹尼吗
Day Drunk Danny that fixes the karaoke machine?

565
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,790
天啊  朱迪
Jesus, Judy.

566
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:29,780
你只是嫉妒我有个手指伸进小洞也很灵活的男友
You're just jealous I got a guy who can work in tight spaces.

567
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,930
说得你真有似的
Like you have any.

568
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:32,390
你不想知道吗
Oh, wouldn't you like to know?

569
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,010
全镇都知道  朱迪
The whole town knows, Judy!

570
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,080
我知道
I know.

571
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,560
-你好啊  -你好
- Hello. - Hello.

572
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,330
真漂亮
Pretty.

573
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,240
-伙计们  -敬互相扶持的女人
- You guys! - To women supporting women.

574
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:46,770
干杯
Yes.

575
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,370
杰伊
Hey, Jay.

576
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,640
谢谢你把文件捡起来
Thanks for picking up the files.

577
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:00,990
我知道你很喜欢这里
I know you like it here,

578
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:03,510
而且和你相处也很愉快
and it's really been great having you.

579
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,240
我们只是...
Um, we're just...

580
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:08,510
我们没有几个月前那么忙了
we're not as busy as we were a couple months ago.

581
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,540
你在听我说话吗
Are you listening to me?

582
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:17,000
这个文件上说你有个孩子
This paper says you had a baby.

583
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:22,920
而且你的孩子和我同一天生
And your baby was born on my exact birthday.

584
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:29,830
没关系  反正我知道自己是被领养的
It's fine. It's not like I didn't know I was adopted.

585
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,600
我...
I...

586
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,360
这很...
It's...

587
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,490
这很复杂
it's complicated.

588
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,100
你知道吗...
You know...

589
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,350
好像也不怎么复杂...
it seems simple.

590
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:45,740
你先是把我送走  然后又对我撒谎
You gave me away and then lied to me.

591
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,270
等等
Wait.

592
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:54,030
如果你是我的亲生母亲  那我的亲生父亲是谁
If you're "Mommy", and who's "Daddy"?

593
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:57,020
不会是那个混蛋吉米吧
It's not that dick Jimmy, is it?

594
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,530
我一下子就猜中了  对吧
I really won the lottery with that one, didn't I?

595
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,690
难怪你要把我送走
No wonder you gave me away.

596
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,260
-我真的很抱歉  -不必了
- I'm so sorry ‐ Don't.

597
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,850
我本来刚要炒她的
I was going to fire her.

598
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,700
{\an8}佩西恩斯
科罗拉多州

599
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,400
你在等公交车吗
Are you waiting for a bus?

600
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,890
我喜欢寒冷  能帮助我思考
I like the cold. It helps me think.

601
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:47,250
佛教僧人认为持续思考使人痛苦
Buddhist monks believe that suffering comes from the thinking mind.

602
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:50,370
他们还能锻炼大脑免受痛苦
They can also train their minds not to feel pain.

603
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:53,100
其中一个人自焚了
One of them lit himself on fire.

604
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,570
我觉得他肯定感到痛苦了
I think that one felt pain.

605
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,060
你在试图宽慰我吗
Trying to make me feel better

606
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,750
我可是刚伤透了一个十七岁女孩的心
after tearing the heart out of a 17‐year‐old girl?

607
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,210
你没有伤她的心
You didn't tear her heart out.

608
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:04,220
你只是骗了她  假装是她朋友
You just lied to her and pretended to be her friend.

609
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,130
你想讨论骗人的事吗
You want to talk about lying?

610
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:09,580
什么样的人会谎称自己妻子死了
What kind of person lies about their wife being dead?

611
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,410
人类就是会说谎
Humans lie.

612
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,900
这是他们的天性
It's what they do.

613
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:17,600
为什么
Why?

614
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:23,190
或许他们不想让别人看清自己的真实面目
Maybe they don't want people to know who they really are.

615
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,690
我说了在餐馆见
I told you I'd meet you at the diner.

616
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,330
我也很高兴见到你
Nice to see you, too.

617
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:41,580
我是哈里·万德斯本格  我想我们见过一面
Harry Vanderspeigle. I think we met briefly.

618
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,120
你想找茬吗  伙计
Are you fu‐‐ with me, man?

619
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,380
当然不是
No, of course not.

620
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,540
真是个怂蛋
Chicken‐ass bitch.

621
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,290
好了  走吧
Okay. Let's go.

622
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:53,770
咱们走
Let's go!

623
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,560
别这样
Don't.

624
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,210
我不是为了这个联系你
That is not why I texted you.

625
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:08,770
你总是这么说
You always say that.

626
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,460
你得听我说
I need you to listen.

627
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,460
很难开口  事关那个孩子
This is hard. It's about the baby.

628
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:17,450
她发现了我们的身份
She found out who we are.

629
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,630
她是怎么知道你的
How did she find you?

630
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,630
是杰伊
It's Jay.

631
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:32,400
接电话的那个坏脾气女孩吗
The girl with the attitude that answers the phone?

632
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,650
对  她是我们的女儿
Yeah. She's our daughter.

633
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,650
没错  我雇她的时候就知道
And, yes, I knew that when I hired her.

634
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,880
天啊  阿斯塔
Jesus, Asta.

635
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:40,430
你是怎么搞的
That is messed up.

636
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,680
他在这里做什么
What the hell is he doing here?

637
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,740
他是你新男友还是怎样
What, is he your new boyfriend or something?

638
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:54,470
-不是  -不是
- No. - No.

639
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,450
我只是来这里吃蛋糕
I'm just here eating cake.

640
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,200
-你现在成她的保镖了吗  -哈里
- You her bodyguard now? - Harry.

641
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,990
-我更喜欢你叫我忍者  -哈里
- I prefer ninja. - Harry.

642
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,190
你没必要这么做的  无视他就好了
You don't have to do this. Just ignore him.

643
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,330
你不应该无视忍者
You shouldn't ignore ninjas.

644
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:07,090
你不要理睬他就好了
Just don't pay any attention to him.

645
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:09,870
他最近在读跟僧侣和忍者相关的书
He's reading books about monks and ninjas.

646
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,710
你知道多久了
How long have you known?

647
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,690
一直知道
Always.

648
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,720
从你劝我送走我自己的孩子开始
Since you talked me into giving up my own baby.

649
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,200
该死  阿斯塔
Damn it, Asta!

650
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,320
你当时也没准备好
You weren't ready either!

651
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,680
你认真的吗
Are you serious?

652
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,560
我告诉你  只是因为想让你先从我口中得知
I'm only telling you so that you will hear it from me first.

653
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,570
如果杰伊来找你
If Jay comes to find you,

654
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,080
我不想你冲她发火
I don't want you flipping out on her.

655
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,720
你是她人生中最不需要的人
You're the last person she needs in her life.

656
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,970
行啊
Oh, right.

657
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:39,070
你总是把我说成神经病
You always make me out to be the psycho.

658
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,000
知道吗
You know what?

659
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,600
你自己之前做的事也不正常
Doing what you did, that shit ain't normal.

660
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,170
你真的想要保护她的话
You really wanted to protect her,

661
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:46,080
你根本就不应该走进她的生活
you should've stayed the hell out of her life.

662
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,560
她知道真相的话更好
It's better that she knows.

663
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,800
这不是你的问题
This isn't your problem.

664
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,620
不应该由你来解决
You shouldn't have to deal with it.

665
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,240
你当时太小了  记不住
You're too young to remember...

666
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,240
但是那一晚
but that night,

667
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,120
在我意识到你妈妈不回来之后
when I realized your mother wasn't coming back,

668
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,550
我把你抱得更紧  并对你发誓
I tucked you in extra tight, and I made a promise to you

669
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:16,430
我永远不会让你独自一人面对自己的人生
that I'd never leave you to do this life alone.

670
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,890
我怎么能离开她
How could I leave her?

671
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,050
你当时也没有更好的主意
Well, you didn't know any better.

672
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,920
但是我向你保证
But I promise you,

673
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,110
她有一个爱她的家
she has a family that loves her

674
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,910
他们将她视如己出
as if she was their own.

675
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:36,100
哈里去哪了
Where did Harry go?

676
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,320
忍者
Ninja.

677
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:57,040
她为什么还在这里
Why is she still here?

678
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,150
她在我家的话
How am I supposed to get into my underwear

679
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:02,470
我该怎么只穿着内裤看杰里·奥尔巴赫
and watch Jerry Orbach with that hot ham in my house?

680
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,940
你说过你会永远离开的
You said you were going away forever.

681
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:27,050
恐怕我今天是有点失态
I'm afraid I didn't handle things very well today.

682
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:29,340
我真的很想能补偿你
I'd really love to make it up to you.

683
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,050
希望你饿了
Hope you're hungry.

684
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,190
你从哪里拿到的这些牛排
Where did you get these steaks?

685
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,520
从楼下的冷冻柜里
They were in the freezer downstairs.

686
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:42,620
这不可能  因为门是
That's impossible, because the door is...

687
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,210
开着的
Open!

688
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:47,750
怪胎  我不知道你为什么把一切都锁起来
You freak, I don't know why you locked everything like that.

689
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,200
我觉得我们在这里不用这样
I don't think we have to do that out here.

690
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,580
我不得不把冰柜的锁给撬开
I had to break the lock of the icebox

691
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,790
好拿到  牛排
just to get the...steaks.

692
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:54,270
还得去拿些冻豌豆
Got to get some frozen peas.

693
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:57,580
我去拿
I'll get them.

694
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:00,650
你真好
You're lovely.

695
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,250
你真安静  你在想什么
You're so quiet. What are you thinking?

696
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,270
想我能不能把你的尸体塞进冰柜
If I could fit your body in the freezer

697
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,500
和另一个家伙放在一起
next to the other guy.

698
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,340
想很多事情
So many things.

699
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:46,950
你完全不一样了
You're so different.

700
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,310
自从我来到这以后  你就很不像原来的你
You haven't been yourself since I got here.

701
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,660
我就是我
I am myself.

702
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:54,440
我一直都是我
I've always been myself.

703
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:55,930
一个男人
A man...

704
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,150
而不是别的什么
and nothing else.

705
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,150
看  这就是我在说的
See, that's what I'm talking about.

706
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,380
我知道你是怎么回事
I know what's going on with you.

707
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,080
你在害怕
You're afraid.

708
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:09,900
这么说没错
I'll go with that.

709
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:11,140
我也很害怕
I'm scared, too.

710
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,310
好多人突然来到我们的公寓
Men showed up at the apartment

711
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:15,070
说他们需要跟你谈谈
and said they needed to talk to you.

712
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:17,690
听着  我不在乎你惹了什么麻烦  真的
Look, I don't care what trouble you're in. I really don't.

713
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,430
不管你发生了什么事情
Whatever's going on with you,

714
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:22,570
我都会在你身边  不论什么事
I'll be there with you, no matter what.

715
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,170
好的  达茜
All right, D'arce.

716
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:45,770
你想要孤注一掷吗
You want to put yourself out there?

717
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,420
那就来吧
Let's do this.

718
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,900
来吧  猛男  我们来跳舞
Come on, you beast. Let's have a dance.

719
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:21,040
该死
Shit.

720
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:25,770
真是浪费我的体香剂
That was a waste of deodorant.

721
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,450
晚餐结束了
Well, dinner's over.

722
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,120
接下来做什么
What next?

723
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,340
我只能想到一件事
I can only think of one thing.

724
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:52,070
在你离开前把平底锅洗了
Scrub the pans before you leave.

725
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,050
*有一位男孩*
*There was a boy*

726
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:04,120
*一位非常奇怪*
*A very strange*

727
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:07,500
*被施了魔法的男孩*
*Enchanted boy*

728
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,710
*他们说他游荡了好远*
*They say he wandered very far*

729
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,010
*好远*
*Very far*

730
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,150
*经过了天涯海角*
*Over land and sea*

731
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:23,910
*然后有一天*
*And then one day*

732
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:27,590
*在神奇的一天  他来到了我面前*
*One magic day, he passed my way*

733
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:32,280
*我们谈论了许多事情*
*And while we spoke of many things*

734
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:35,650
*有弄臣和国王*
*Fools and kings*

735
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:40,980
*他还对我说*
*This he said to me*

736
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:48,270
*我们能遇到最美好的事情*
*The greatest thing you'll ever learn*

737
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:51,620
*就是爱*
*Is to love*

738
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:54,270
*和被爱*
*And be loved*

739
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,820
*只管去爱*
*Just to love*

740
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,620
*只管*
*And be*

741
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,320
*被爱*
*Loved*

742
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,100
你想要把他送到佐治亚州
You want to send him to Georgia?

743
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,730
我当然不想把他送走
Of course I don't want to send him away.

744
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:39,300
但是我们的孩子精神出了问题
But we have a broken child.

745
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,770
唯一比将他送走更可怕的事情
The only thing scarier than being away from him

746
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,610
就是如果我们不采取行动  他的情况会更糟糕
is him getting worse if we don't do something about it.

747
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,560
但是  也许他长大后就好了
But maybe he'll outgrow it on his own.

748
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,450
就像吐字不清和...和吮大拇指一样
You know, like the lisp or the‐‐or the thumb sucking.

749
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:49,540
不  我觉得
No. I just‐‐I think‐‐

750
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,940
我觉得  我们应该给他更多时间
I just think that we should give it more time.

751
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,390
这不一样
This is different.

752
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:55,350
那个地方是专门帮助他的  而我们做不到
This place is equipped to help him in ways that we can't.

753
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,480
说实话
Be honest.

754
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:00,980
你觉得麦克斯是个正常的小孩吗
Does Max seem like a normal little boy to you?

755
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,710
不  我想不是
No, I‐I guess not.

756
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,600
我是不是掉发了
Am I losing my hair?

757
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,390
什么  没有  怎么突然
What? No. What?

758
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:15,580
你不觉得我的发际线往后退了一点吗
Don't you feel like it's gone back a little bit?

759
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,860
没有
No.

760
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,520
{\an8}《圣餐》
一个真实的故事

761
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:19,830
麦克斯呼叫萨哈尔  你听到了吗
Max for Sahar. Do you read me?

762
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:22,950
萨哈尔收到  完毕
Sahar here, over.

763
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:26,040
我知道你不相信我说的关于外星人的事
I know you don't believe me about the alien.

764
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:28,700
我父母要把我送走了
My parents are sending me away.

765
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,990
完毕
Over.

766
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:32,690
我只是说我不记得
All I said was that I didn't remember.

767
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:34,380
我当然还是相信你的
Of course I still believe you.

768
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,320
没人要把你送走
And nobody's sending you away.

769
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,430
我有一个主意  完毕
I have an idea. Over.

770
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,200
不需要害怕
There's no need to be frightened.

771
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:51,380
我会照顾好你的
I'll take care of you.

772
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,780
告诉巴贝特哪里疼
Tell Babette where it hurts.

773
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:55,500
我不知道巴贝特是谁...
I don't know who Babette is‐‐

774
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,390
感觉好棒
Ooh, that feels good.

775
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:16,160
天啊  你真帅
God, you're handsome.

776
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,220
你也是
So are you.

777
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,270
我不知道我们在干什么
I don't know what we're doing.

778
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,090
我们在重燃爱火
We're reconnecting.

779
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,640
我就知道你依然爱着我
I knew you still loved me.

780
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,920
你甚至不想把那个取下来
Didn't have the heart to take it down.

781
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,120
我们将会永远在一起的
We're gonna be together forever.

782
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:28,080
我以为你现在应该在佐治亚州被肛测了
I thought you'd be in Georgia by now getting probed.

783
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,530
人类才不会肛测  只有愚蠢的外星人才会这么干
Humans don't probe. Only stupid aliens do that.

784
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:32,930
我们的人不会这么干
My people don't.

785
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:35,670
灰种才喜欢屁股
It's the greys that have the ass fetish.

786
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:38,510
只有大人之间才能说这种话  我们不喜欢
That's adult language, and we don't appreciate it.

787
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,870
你来这里干什么
What are you doing here?

788
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:41,690
你见到我不该这么惊讶
You shouldn't be that surprised to see me.

789
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:44,330
碰到你那浮在空中的苹果也许是消除了我的记忆
Touching your floating apple may have knocked out my memory,

790
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:46,490
但没有弄死我
but it didn't kill me.

791
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:48,020
也许下次就会了
Maybe next time.

792
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,470
不会再有下次了
There won't be a next time.

793
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:52,840
别  麦克斯  大人说话呢
Hold on, Max. The adults are talking.

794
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,700
麦克斯不会去那个机构
Max isn't going to that institute.

795
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,740
我曾经为了逃离苏菲祈祷圈
I once held my breath for two minutes

796
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:00,560
憋气整整两分钟
just to get out of a Sufi prayer circle.

797
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:02,400
我会教他的
I'll teach him.

798
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,480
我敢打赌他将憋气一小时
I'll bet he'll hold his breath for an hour

799
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,600
成功逃出佐治亚州
to get out of Georgia.

800
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,010
很好  那他肯定死了
Good. Then he'll be dead.

801
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:09,580
我会找到他的坟墓并吐上口水
I'll find his tombstone and spit on it.

802
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,900
你没办法那么做
You won't be able to

803
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,890
因为他将会被火化
because he's going to be cremated

804
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:15,470
骨灰将会撒进海里
and have the ashes sprinkled into the ocean.

805
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:19,510
很好  那我也吐上口水  吐在你DNA上
Fine. Then I'll spit on it, and it'll hit your dead DNA.

806
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:21,870
不  那也不可能  因为我骗了你
No, it won't. Because I tricked you.

807
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:24,700
他的骨灰没有被撒进大海
He didn't really have his ashes put into the ocean.

808
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,590
我藏在了你的口袋里
I snuck them into your pocket.

809
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:29,100
所以你往大海里吐口水时
So, when you were spitting into the ocean,

810
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:32,860
他就一直在你的口袋里嘲笑你
he was in your pocket laughing at you the whole time.

811
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:35,360
你的口水永远不可能吐中他
Your spit will never get near him.

812
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,000
我们又赢了
We win again.

813
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:40,860
吐中了
I got you.

814
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:48,960
我觉得我刚刚做的应该
I don't think what I just did was...

815
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:51,000
不是正常的人类行为
normal human behavior.

816
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,820
我们把你逼疯了吗
Are we driving you crazy?

817
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,100
赶紧习惯吧
Get used to it.

818
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,200
我们俩都会憋气
We're both holding our breath

819
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,840
等你保证你会永远不会烦他
until you promise to leave him alone.

820
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:03,100
等我们晕过去了  他们就会觉得是你干的
When we pass out, they'll think you did it.

821
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,620
很好  那样安静多了
Good. It'll be quieter.

822
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:18,050
太好了  我有更多空气了
Great. More air for me.

823
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,900
谢谢  我要再来点
Thank you. I'll have some more.

824
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,600
你们看上去好蠢
You look silly.

825
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,430
听着  你们还要憋多久
Look, I mean, how long is this?

826
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,070
好吧
Okay.

827
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,020
好了  停下
Okay, stop!

828
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:44,300
-你们想要什么  -休战
- What do you want? - A truce.

829
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:47,140
你和我爸妈说我没有疯  让我能继续留在家里
You tell my parents I'm not crazy so I can stay home,

830
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:49,360
我就不会告诉所有人你是外星人
and I'll stop telling everyone you're an alien.

831
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,750
杀掉他行不行  我还能杀掉他吗
What about killing him? Can I still kill him?

832
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:52,970
不行
No!

833
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,990
"休战"这个词就暗示了这一点
That's pretty much implied in the word "truce."

834
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,810
来吧
Go ahead.

835
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:01,820
握手言和
Shake on it.

836
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,380
好吧
Fine.

837
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:08,900
还有什么问题吗  麦克斯
Any questions, Max?

838
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,360
有  我为什么能看到你
Yeah. Why can I see you?

839
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:14,080
你了解多空间时空穿梭吗
Are you familiar with multidimensional space travel?

840
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,060
很了解
Very.

841
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,720
有的人基因上就和其他空间的频率
Some humans are genetically more tuned

842
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,220
更加和谐
to the frequencies of other dimensions,

843
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,810
所以他们能看穿我们的分子构造
so they can see beyond my molecular reconstruction.

844
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:22,790
就像那件蓝黑的衣服
Like that was blue and black

845
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,900
但有的人觉得那是白金的
but some people saw it as white and gold?

846
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,350
那不是白金的吗
It wasn't white and gold?

847
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:27,370
不是
No!

848
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,170
我有一个问题
I have a question.

849
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:35,470
人类吃披萨的时候为什么要折起来
Why do humans fold pizza when they eat it?

850
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,920
基础工程学
Basic engineering.

851
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,730
平摊着吃太软了
It's too floppy when it's flat.

852
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:42,010
纳斯卡地画到底是什么
What are the Nazca lines?

853
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:43,800
古老的外形涂鸦
Ancient alien graffiti.

854
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,200
外星人会大便吗
Do aliens poop?

855
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,640
人人都会大便
Everybody poops.

856
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:50,520
跟书上说的一样  我就知道
Just like the book. I knew it.

857
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,820
我刚发现麦克斯发现了我本来的身份时
When I first discovered that Max knew who I really was,

858
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,750
我很恨他
I hated him for it.

859
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:01,090
也许我其实并不恨他
Maybe I did not actually hate him.

860
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:05,810
我只是恨他给我带来的感受
I just hated how he made me feel inside.

861
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,490
我感到暴露在众人眼中  非常脆弱
I felt exposed, vulnerable.

862
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:12,570
也可以说是我憎恨我自己
In a way, I hated myself.

863
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:50,780
但是和这些孩子聊了短短十分钟后
But after talking to those kids for just ten minutes,

864
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,670
我就感觉到我的恨烟消云散了
I could feel my hatred going away.

865
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,060
也许还有比恨更加强大的东西
Maybe there's something out there stronger than hate.

866
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,210
饿了吗
Hungry?

867
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,450
我的钱只能买得起一杯咖啡
I've only got enough for coffee.

868
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,650
没关系
Well, that's okay.

869
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:06,970
家人之间不用付钱
Family don't pay.

870
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,890
既然这样  我要两个汉堡
In that case, I'll get two burgers‐‐

871
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,340
一个堂吃  一个带走
one for here and one to go‐‐

872
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:14,770
还有一块派
and a slice of pie.

873
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:17,610
好的
Yeah, all right.

874
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:23,030
警长
Sheriff?

875
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,670
山姆的毒理报告出来了
Sam's toxicology results are in.

876
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,220
肉毒杆菌毒素A的含量水平超高
Botulinum toxin A levels are through the roof.

877
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,840
山姆是被毒死的
Sam was poisoned.

878
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:35,740
上帝老爷啊  我们这儿出了个杀人凶手
Holy shit sticks! We got ourselves a murder!

879
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:43,000
-副警长  -是  警长
- Deputy. - Yeah. Sheriff.

880
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,180
-好了  继续查  -好
- All right. Get on it. - Okay.

881
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:45,400
-继续  -嗯  请享受你的早餐
- Get on it. - Yeah. Enjoy your breakfast.

882
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,890
-好  谢谢  女士  -好
- All right, thank you, ma'am. - Okay.

883
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:55,200
我对她有很多感觉
I feel many emotions about this one.

884
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,520
我觉得和她很亲近
I feel close to her.

885
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:04,320
但有时候  我希望能远一点
Yet sometimes, I want to be far away.

886
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:18,610
我不恨她
I don't hate her.

887
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:23,240
我只是...需要...睡眠
I just...need...sleep.

888
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:31,160
看来能让她再多活一天
I guess she can live another day.
