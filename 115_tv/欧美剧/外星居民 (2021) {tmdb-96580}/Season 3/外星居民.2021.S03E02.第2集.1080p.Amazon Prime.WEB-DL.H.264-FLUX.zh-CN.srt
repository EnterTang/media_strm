{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Previously on "Resident Alien."

18
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,680
被困在外星上
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Stranded on an alien planet.

19
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,340
为了活下来  并完成我的任务
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}In order to survive and complete my mission,

20
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,810
我得想办法用人形融入这里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I would have to somehow fit in with the human life forms.

21
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,920
哈里·万德斯本格医生
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Dr. Harry Vanderspeigle?

22
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,460
昨晚镇上发生了一起谋杀案
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We had a murder in town last night.

23
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,890
我们要你来帮我们看看尸体
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We need you to come down and take a look at the body.

24
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,220
-搞什么鬼  -你没死
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- What the mother hell? - You're not dead.

25
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,480
阿斯塔是护士
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Asta's the nurse.

26
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,410
是新来的那个医生
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's the new doctor.

27
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,250
-他是外星人  -等等  外星人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- He's an alien. - Wait, an alien?

28
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,790
你到底教了这孩子什么鬼啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What the hell are you teaching this kid, huh?

29
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,360
一个错误
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}One mistake.

30
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,980
一个为了生存而犯下的小错误
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Just one mistake made out of necessity for survival.

31
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:52,800
我别无选择
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I had no choice

32
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,890
只能杀死了那个叫哈里·万德斯本格的人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but to kill the human known as Harry Vanderspeigle.

33
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,680
我是在保护自己
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I was just defending myself.

34
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,780
在我把他
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How was I supposed to know

35
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,490
从冰上扔下去时
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}when I threw him on top of the ice

36
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,350
我怎么知道他会消失在湖里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}he would disappear into the lake?

37
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,550
我是一个外星人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I am an alien.

38
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,660
我根本不知道地球是怎么样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't know every little detail about how Earth works.

39
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,050
一切都会没事的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Everything will be fine.

40
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:16,080
我只需要赶在别人之前找到尸体
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I just need to find that body before someone else does.

41
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,200
{\an8\bord1\fs18\b1}外星居民

睡觉  人类弱小又低效的另一个有力实例
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sleep: another example of humans being weak and inefficient.

43
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:44,020
他们的身体每天必须休眠八小时
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Their bodies must shut down for eight hours every single day,

44
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,120
不然就不能正常工作
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}or they don't work properly.

45
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,890
拜托到六点了  拜托到六点了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Please be 6:00 A. M. Please be 6:00 A. M.

46
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,180
有好多事要做
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So much to do.

47
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,270
我要找到湖里的那具尸体  找到我的设备
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I have to find that body in the lake, find my device,

48
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,650
我在山上炸裂的飞船碎片
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}the pieces of my ship that broke off over the mountains,

49
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,560
我要杀了那个孩子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I have to kill that kid--

50
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,500
差点就忘了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}mm, almost forgot about that.

51
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,340
灭绝人类
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Exterminate the human race.

52
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,200
牛奶  得弄点牛奶
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Milk, gotta get milk.

53
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,390
别忘了牛奶
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't forget the milk.

54
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,220
也许可以弄点碎片
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Maybe some cereal.

55
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,340
要是我睡不着
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If I can't sleep,

56
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,080
至少可以学学提升我的医术
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I can at least learn to be a better doctor.

57
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,000
环切包皮
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Circumcision.

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,270
这是什么  眼部手术吗  点击
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What is that, eye surgery? Click.

59
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,070
他们是野蛮人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They are a savage people.

60
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,250
焕然一新
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Refreshed.

61
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,980
有足够的能量去登山了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Plenty of energy to climb a mountain.

62
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,330
你听说剧院边的那家中国餐馆
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Did you hear that Chinese restaurant next to the theater

63
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,560
要关门了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}is shutting down?

64
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,430
不是吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No way.

65
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,130
我超喜欢那家店
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I love that place.

66
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,490
李太太说她丈夫出轨
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, Mrs. Lee accused her husband of cheating.

67
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,070
他们应该要离婚了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I guess they're splitting up.

68
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,590
什么  他们俩明明很般配
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What? They're such a great couple.

69
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,700
可能只是一些误会
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's probably a misunderstanding.

70
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,990
我会找她聊聊的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'll talk to her.

71
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,200
我听说有人想要把那里改成披萨快餐店
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I hear someone wants to turn it into a gourmet pizza joint.

72
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,500
从另一方面来说
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}On the other hand,

73
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,140
他的确很有女人缘  所以吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}he was handsy with the ladies, so.

74
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,240
她也是迫于无奈了吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}She's gotta do what she's gotta do.

75
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,790
好了  你往高处扔  我往低处扔
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Right. You throw high, I'll throw low?

76
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,440
-引线开  -引线开
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Spinner's on. - Spinner's on.

77
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,060
-保险移除  -保险移除
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Safety off. - Safety off.

78
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,890
三  二  一  拉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Three, two, one, pull.

79
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,140
漂亮的勾手
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Nice hook shot.

80
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,070
球是命
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Ball is life.

81
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,190
再说一遍试试
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, say that again.

82
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,870
-球是命  -不  别
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Ball is life. - No, don't--

83
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,990
-别说两遍...  -球是命
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- don't say it twi-- - Ball is life.

84
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,490
你总是这样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You always do that.

85
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,530
这是我找到的第三片飞船碎片
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This is the third piece of my ship that I've found.

86
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,550
我的设备肯定就在附近
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}My device has to be nearby.

87
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,270
这里不止我一个人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm not alone up here.

88
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,860
这可不妙
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This is bad.

89
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,170
我感觉到我的后虹膜皱褶和我的睾丸收紧了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I just felt my rear iris pucker and my testicles tighten.

90
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,900
我的味道没有变
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}My taint remains unchanged.

91
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,090
雪崩覆盖了我的搜索区域
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That avalanche covering my search area

92
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,560
让我的工作几乎倒退了一周
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}has set me back at least a week.

93
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,170
这些人类自以为总是能跑来破坏我的计划
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}These humans think they can constantly thwart my plans.

94
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,850
不可能了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, no more.

95
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,440
真是太扯淡了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This is some bullshit!

96
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,750
你好  我叫凯特·霍索恩
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hi, I'm Kate Hawthorne.

97
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,580
我的丈夫是本  镇长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}My husband is Ben, the mayor.

98
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,130
我见过他  身上一股汤味
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I met him. He smells like soap.

99
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,990
就是他
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, that's him.

100
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,100
我的儿子几天前从你的诊所逃走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}My son ran out of your office a few days ago.

101
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,270
我能进去吗  拜托
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Can I come in? Please?

102
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,340
好  稍等一下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yes, just one minute.

103
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,980
我有事要和你说
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I need to talk to you about something.

104
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,860
我的儿子麦克斯和我说你是外新人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}My son Max told me you're an alien.

105
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,440
然后呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What's that then?

106
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,540
他还和我说你闯进了他的卧室
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He also told me that you broke into his bedroom

107
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,310
想要杀死他
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and tried to kill him.

108
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,810
有意思
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's interesting.

109
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,210
他到底怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What is wrong with him?

110
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,660
他为什么要编这些事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Why is he making things up?

111
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,620
-你觉得他在说谎  -他当然在说谎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- You think he's lying. - Of course he's lying.

112
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,580
你显然不是外星人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're obviously not an alien.

113
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,030
他之前从诊所跑了  我真是尴尬死了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm so embarrassed that he ran out of the clinic.

114
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:32,870
真抱歉打扰你了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm sorry to bother you.

115
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,910
这种事我通常是跟山姆聊的  可他...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I normally talk to Sam about this stuff, but he's--

116
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:38,970
你知道的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}well, you know.

117
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,260
他死了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He's dead.

118
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,180
-对  -你没什么好担心的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Yeah. - Well, you don't have anything to worry about.

119
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,000
我不是外星人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm not an alien.

120
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,480
太可惜了  我听说外星人还挺酷的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Unfortunately. I hear they're pretty cool.

121
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,550
谢谢你过来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thank you for coming over.

122
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:56,620
只是...我没法让我儿子放下这个想法
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's just-- I can't get my son off of this.

123
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,090
他不只是编造故事  他...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And it's not just the stories, he's--

124
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,780
他还画了画
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}he's drawn pictures.

125
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:06,090
非常多的画  你看看
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Lots and lots of pictures. Look at them.

126
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,670
太让人担心了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They're disturbing.

127
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,520
还有那个外星人  他...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And that alien? I mean--

128
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,880
他居然说服副警长画了这个
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}he even convinced the deputy to draw this.

129
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,390
你看看  恶心死了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Look at this, it's disgusting.

130
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,870
我光是看着就想吐了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Makes me want to throw up just looking at it.

131
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,430
有的人以为人类就够丑了呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Some people think humans are ugly.

132
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,180
我不知道该怎么办了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I just don't know what to do.

133
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,660
麦克斯不肯睡觉  不肯吃东西
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Max won't sleep, he won't eat,

134
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,640
实话说吧  他快把我逼疯了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and, frankly, he is driving me crazy.

135
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,090
你是医生
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're a doctor.

136
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,220
有什么我们能做的吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is there anything that we can do?

137
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,370
搬走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Move.

138
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,170
-什么  -搬得远远的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- What? - Far away from here.

139
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:43,000
找所新学校  开始新生活
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}A new school, a new life.

140
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,760
如果麦克斯知道自己再也不会踏入科罗拉多州
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If Max knows that he is never setting a foot in Colorado

141
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,150
或是美国西部
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}or the Western United States again,

142
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,490
我觉得他会成为一个快乐的孩子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I think that he will be a happy kid.

143
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,890
我们在这里有工作
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Uh, we have jobs.

144
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,910
我丈夫是镇长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}My husband is the mayor.

145
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,980
苏格兰也招镇长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Scotland needs mayors.

146
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:01,130
我在书上看到的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I read it in a book.

147
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,630
我们不会搬家
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We're not moving.

148
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,730
当然了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Ah, of course!

149
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,940
不搬
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Not.

150
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,650
他可能只是在寻求关注
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He's probably just looking for attention.

151
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,450
对
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah.

152
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,040
可能有道理
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I guess that makes sense.

153
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,120
我白天会尽量避开麦克斯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I try and steer clear of Max during the day.

154
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:30,200
有一个在学校工作的妈并不轻松
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Having a mom who works at school isn't the easiest thing.

155
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,410
忽视  是你的错
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Neglect. It's your fault.

156
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,420
这样的话  你可以走了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And with that, you can go.

157
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,930
嗯...我...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Uh... yeah, well, I...

158
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:42,240
看来我就尽量多陪陪他吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}guess I'll just try spending more time with him.

159
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:46,600
我得承认  我觉得自己都快疯了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Gotta be honest, I feel like I'm losing my mind.

160
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,150
麦克斯再不放弃外星人的事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Max doesn't drop the alien thing,

161
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,980
我就要杀了他
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm gonna kill him.

162
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,470
你我都是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You and me both.

163
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,010
谢谢你做的一切
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thank you so much for everything--

164
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,370
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}'Kay.

165
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,580
早啊  混蛋
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Good morning, dickhead.

166
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,000
你不能那么叫我  那是个不好的词
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Can't call me that. That's a nasty word.

167
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,570
对不起了  小杂碎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, I'm sorry, shit-for-brains.

168
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,660
你没礼貌  你还偷了我的传单
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're inappropriate and you stole my flyers.

169
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,410
你还想把它们贴回去吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Do you wanna put them back up?

170
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,610
尽管去啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Go ahead.

171
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:42,860
反正也没人相信你  连你父母都不信
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No one believes you, anyway, not even your parents.

172
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,930
去跟人说我是外星人啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Tell people I am an alien.

173
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:48,710
爬到镇上最高的塔上
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Climb to the highest tower in town

174
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:51,200
昭告天下啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and shout it to everyone.

175
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,150
现在没有塔了  傻子外星人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We don't have towers, you dumb alien.

176
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,250
不  我...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, I--

177
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,000
我知道没塔  我那是个比喻
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I know that; it was a figure of speech.

178
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,460
才不是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, it wasn't.

179
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,300
我的天  你还真以为我们有塔
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, my God, you actually thought we had towers.

180
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,380
-我没有  -你太笨了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- I did not! - You're so stupid.

181
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,450
"你好  我是外星人  我以为这是有城堡的年代
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}"Hi, I'm an alien and I think it's castle times

182
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,040
还有塔这种东西"
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and there are towers."

183
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,180
我是在试探你是不是以为这里有塔
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I was testing to see if you thought there were towers,

184
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:16,510
算你走运  你过关了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and you're lucky you passed.

185
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,780
-我现在要去上学了  -等等
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Well, I'm gonna go to school now. - Wait.

186
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,470
希望不会有塔砸在我身上
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I hope a tower doesn't fall on me

187
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,900
因为我们活在自欺欺人的时代
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}because we live in make-believe times.

188
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,340
是你以为现在还有塔
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're the one who thinks there's towers!

189
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,250
混蛋
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Dickhead.

190
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,530
垃...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Assh--

191
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,370
垃圾
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Asshole.

192
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,860
阿丝儿塔
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, Ass-ta.

193
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,100
是阿斯塔  艾伦  你知道的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's Ah-sta, Ellen. You knew that.

194
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,400
抱歉  肯定是我的加拿大基因在作祟
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sorry. Must be the Canadian in me.

195
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,530
在你假想的国界线这头  我叫阿斯塔
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, on this side of the imaginary border, it's Ah-sta.

196
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:56,180
帕斯塔  抓马  阿斯塔  还有什么能帮你的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Pasta, drama, Ah-sta. What else can I do for you?

197
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,610
阿斯塔  V医生需要些处方签
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Ah-sta, Dr. V needs some prescription pads,

198
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,090
可我找不着
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but I can't find any.

199
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,810
你都找了哪里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, where have you looked?

200
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,850
我还没找呢  你去帮他拿行吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I haven't looked yet. Can you get them?

201
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:33,000
{\an8\bord1\fs18\b1}员工间

202
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:33,270
你在干什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Whoa, what are you doing?

203
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:36,060
-我太想要了  -什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- I want that so badly. - Excuse me?

204
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,220
睡觉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sleep.

205
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,390
我晚上睡不着  现在正努力学习怎么睡
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I can't sleep at night. I'm trying to learn how.

206
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:44,390
好吧  停下来  怪瘆人的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay, well, please stop. It's creepy.

207
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,480
起来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Get up.

208
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,280
杰伊  醒醒
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Jay, Jay, wake up.

209
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,060
醒一醒
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Please wake up.

210
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:52,260
你在周围看到山姆的处方笺了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Have you seen one of Sam's prescription pads laying around?

211
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,180
少了一个
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There's one missing.

212
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,710
我不知道他有没有带回家
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't know if he took it home, I...

213
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,360
他以前总把它们放在办公室
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}he always used to keep them here.

214
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,120
这就是你叫醒我的原因吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's why you woke me up?

215
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,570
那你有没有看到
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, have you seen it or not?

216
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,810
没有
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Not.

217
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,520
我只是在这打工挣学分
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I just work here for school credit.

218
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,090
我都不知道压舌板在哪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I barely know where the tongue depressors are.

219
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,410
我以为睡觉能让人感觉好点
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I thought sleep was supposed to make you feel better.

220
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:16,500
放她一马吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Cut her some slack.

221
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,660
她可能跟我们一样整晚没睡
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}She was probably up all night reeling like the rest of us.

222
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:23,630
你都不认识山姆  你为什么睡不着
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You didn't even know Sam. Why can't you sleep?

223
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,380
湖里漂着一个死去的我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There's a dead me floating in the lake.

224
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:30,160
我找不到大脑的开关
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I can't find the on/off switch in my brain.

225
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,500
你有冥想过吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Do you ever meditate?

226
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,250
你说的冥想  是指安静地坐着
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}By meditate, do you mean sit peacefully

227
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,620
然后思考我想要杀的人吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and think of all the people I want to kill?

228
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:42,020
有  我非常喜欢冥想
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yes. I like it very much.

229
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,390
-很好  -万德斯本格医生
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Good.  - Uh, Dr. Vanderspeigle,

230
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,580
我们需要你去市政厅一趟
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}we need you down at the town hall.

231
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,160
发生什么事了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What's going on?

232
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,510
又发现了一具尸体  这次是在湖里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There's another dead body. This time in the lake.

233
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,560
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay.

234
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:02,050
{\an8\bord1\fs18\b1}市政厅
警长办公室

235
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,290
好了  好了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All right, all right,

236
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,420
现在外面有很多不实传言  好吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}now there's a lot of misinformation out there, okay?

237
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,580
大家都冷静一下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Everybody just needs to calm down.

238
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,040
得有人打开该死的窗户
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And somebody need to open up a damn window

239
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,510
因为这里闻起来像汗津津的户外用品商店
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}'cause it smell like a sweaty REI store up in here.

240
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,650
什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What?

241
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,140
我听说他们发现了一具尸体
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I hear they found a body?

242
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,190
不  只有一只脚
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, just a foot.

243
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,350
杰克·鲁尼在湖里钓鱼时发现的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Jack Rooney found it fishing the lake.

244
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,020
哪个湖  我的湖吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Which lake? My lake?

245
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,370
不是你的湖
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Not your lake.

246
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,520
科罗拉多州的湖
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Belongs to the state of Colorado.

247
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:29,970
你是想唬我吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, are you trying to impress me?

248
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,730
让我以为你有个湖
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}By making me think you own a lake?

249
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,050
没有  我不是那个意思
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, I'm not doing that.

250
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:34,740
你能不能别那么自我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Can maybe you be just a little less needy

251
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,010
稍微察言观色一下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and a little bit more sensitive?

252
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,560
毕竟有人死了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Because somebody's died, so.

253
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,730
拜托  我们能看看那只脚吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Come on, can we see the foot?

254
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:42,050
怎么回事  那只脚是谁的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What's going on? Who does the foot belong to?

255
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,130
对啊  我们能摸摸吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yes, and can we touch it?

256
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,780
他们是被谋杀的吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Were they murdered?

257
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,220
-好了  各位  各位  -脚是什么尺码
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Okay, folks, folks, folks.  - What size is it?

258
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,940
我们正在调查
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This is an ongoing investigation

259
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,760
而我们现在只有...只有一只死者的脚
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and all that we have now is...Is...Is a dead foot.

260
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,400
那只脚是我杀的那个人的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That foot belongs to the guy I killed.

261
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,620
据我们所知  只是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}For all we know, you know, it's just, uh,

262
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,640
某个徒步者的脚被熊咬掉了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}some hiker who got his foot ripped off by a bear.

263
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,540
有只杀人的熊逍遥法外吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There's a killer bear on the loose?

264
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,850
我知道  是我的错
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I know it. It's my own fault.

265
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,630
我应该多花点时间在湖里找
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I should've spent more time searching the lake

266
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:10,850
然后少追超长电视剧《法律与秩序》
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and less time watching "Law & Order" Marathons.

267
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,040
好了  所有人都闭嘴
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All right! I want everybody to shut up!

268
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,090
我希望这里安静到
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I want it so quiet in here,

269
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:16,850
能听到老鼠在棉花上尿尿的声音  明白吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you can hear a mouse piss on cotton, you understand me?

270
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,550
不明白
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No.

271
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,790
-好了  -好吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Now...  - Okay.

272
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,360
你们都知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}As you all know,

273
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,520
我们最近失去我们的山姆·霍奇斯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}we recently lost one of our own, Sam Hodges,

274
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,840
他被谋杀了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}who was murdered.

275
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,640
现在  在这里找到一只脚
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now, finding this here foot in there?

276
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:31,270
这是件好事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This is a good thing,

277
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:34,990
因为这意味着我们镇上没有杀人犯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}'cause it means that we don't have a murderer in our town.

278
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,200
没有吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We--we don't?

279
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,800
我们有一个连环杀手  大伙
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We got ourselves a serial killer, y'all.

280
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,510
这算什么好事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How the hell is that a good thing?

281
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:45,060
连环杀手不会逃跑  躲藏
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Serial killers don't run away and hide.

282
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:48,330
他们潜伏等待再次出手  所以更容易抓到他们
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They lie in wait to strike again, so they're easier to catch.

283
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,410
如果我是个连环杀手
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hell, if I was a serial killer,

284
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:52,820
我现在就在这个房间里寻找下一个受害者
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'd be in this room right now looking for my next victim.

285
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,590
好了  别担心
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All right. Whoa, whoa, whoa, don't worry!

286
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:57,310
我们要把这只脚送去丹佛做DNA检测
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We're gonna send the foot to Denver for DNA testing.

287
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,260
只要我们查出是谁  就能抓住凶手
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Once we find out who it is, we gon' catch this killer.

288
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,160
我不能让他们拿到DNA
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I can't let them get that DNA.

289
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,550
他们会知道我就是湖里的那个死者
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They'll know I'm dead lake man.

290
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,850
医生  你有什么...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Doctor, do you have anything that...

291
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,740
有什么要补充的吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}that you could...That you could add?

292
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:16,550
我好害怕
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I am so scared!

293
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:20,100
真不错  医生  非常应景
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Real nice, Doc. Real smooth, real smooth.

294
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:24,190
害怕是真的  我具有全部的迹象
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fear is real. I have all the signs.

295
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,880
手心出汗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sweaty palms...

296
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,330
心跳加速
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Elevated heartbeat...

297
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,000
帽子不错  怪胎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Nice hat, freak.

298
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:37,500
现在我的身体  能感受人类的情感
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now that I'm in this body, I'm feeling human emotions.

299
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,530
对不起咯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sorry.

300
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:58,880
可怜的家伙
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Poor guy.

301
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:05,290
我猜可能是船的螺旋桨打中了尸体
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}My guess is a boat propeller probably hit the dead body

302
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:08,930
把脚直接切下来了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and just chopped the foot right off.

303
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,290
白人男性
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}White male.

304
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:15,360
我觉得有四十多岁  八十公斤
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm thinking late 40s, 180 pounds,

305
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,840
一米八以上
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}over six feet tall.

306
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,410
这是十二码的脚
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's a size twelve shoe.

307
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,770
天啊  要不是你有两只脚
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Heck, if you didn't have two feet,

308
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:25,080
我都会以为这是你的脚
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'd think this thing was yours.

309
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,010
你真是个幽默的人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You are a funny, hilarious person.

310
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:31,110
总之  如果查出了匹配的DNA
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Anyway, the medical examiner will let us know

311
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:33,100
法医会通知我们的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}if we get a hit on the DNA.

312
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:37,020
对  我知道有可能匹配不到
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, I know there's a chance that there won't be,

313
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,150
但现在基因库里有那么多人的信息
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but with so many people in the database these days,

314
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:43,080
还有那些祖先基因测试
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}all those ancestry testing kits.

315
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,440
我都做过一次
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Even I did one.

316
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,000
结果我发现
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Uh, I found out that, um,

317
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,810
我的亲生父亲
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}my real father

318
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:50,200
其实是我爸爸最好的朋友比尔
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}is actually my dad's best friend, Bill,

319
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,860
所以我告诉了我爸爸
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}so I told my dad

320
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,840
他就和我妈妈分手了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and he and my mom broke up

321
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:58,840
然后他离开搬去了俄亥俄州  所以...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and then he left town and he moved to Ohio, so...

322
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,950
我不推荐那些测试
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't recommend those tests.

323
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,880
不管怎样  很快基因库里就只缺
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Anyway, soon the only people who won't be in the database

324
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,620
隐士和婴儿的信息了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}are hermits and babies.

325
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,030
绝对是我的脚
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Definitely my foot.

326
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,640
我的种族进化出了令人惊叹的能力
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's amazing how my people have developed the ability

327
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,400
能够从细胞层面模仿其他生命体
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to mimic other life forms on the cellular level.

328
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,750
我们是种无与伦比的...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We are an incredible...

329
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,460
我忘记关门了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And I forgot to close the door.

330
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,370
等你又古怪完了以后
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}When you're doing being next-level weird,

331
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,540
布里斯科一家在诊室等着
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}we have the Briscoes in the exam room.

332
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,190
找到我的袜子了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, there's my sock.

333
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,060
在这呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's here.

334
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,720
我的那只脚去哪了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Where's my goddamn foot?

335
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,880
你偷了我那个死人的小脚丫
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You stole my five dead little piggies,

336
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,700
更别提还有丽芙最爱的铁桶了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}not to mention Liv's favorite bucket.

337
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,020
她总把汽水放在那里面
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}She puts her soda pop in there.

338
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,920
我可以帮忙  我是个病理学家
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I can help. I am a pathologist.

339
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,280
你不需要把整只脚送到丹佛去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You don't need to send the whole foot to Denver.

340
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,940
那就把这玩意病理一下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, then pathologize the damn thing

341
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,770
给我整份DNA样本
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and get me a DNA sample.

342
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,920
{\an8\bord1\fs18\b1}美国著名连环杀手

343
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,920
我们这出了个泰德·邦迪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We got some Ted Bundy shit going on around here,

344
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,890
我得在他下次出手之前阻止他
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and I need to put a stop to it before he strikes again.

345
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,080
或者是她
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Or she.

346
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,590
杀手可能是个女人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The killer could be a woman.

347
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,670
那是性别歧视  你这性别主义者
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's sexist. You're sexist.

348
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:12,710
让我来告诉你吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let me tell you something.

349
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:16,030
我说"他"的时候  我指的是男女统称
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}When I say he, I mean he or she.

350
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:16,990
我们两个之间
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know, between you and me,

351
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,750
还说什么政治正确的屁话
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}what is this PC bullshit anyway now?

352
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,220
还得用"他/她"代指"他"吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You gotta say "he/she" for "he"

353
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,750
"他"本来指的就是"他/她"  懂我意思吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}when "he" already mean "he/she," you know what I mean?

354
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,330
我只觉得那样更尊重人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I just think it'll be more respectful

355
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:28,280
如果你觉得杀手也能是女人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}if you think of the killer as a woman.

356
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,770
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay.

357
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,620
告诉你我觉得什么叫尊重吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, let me tell you what I think would be respectful...

358
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,850
那就是你给我从这只脚上取下一块皮肤样本
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}is if you got me a skin sample off this foot

359
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:37,350
别让我等得要吃伟哥了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}before I start needing dick pills.

360
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:40,460
现在我去候诊室等着你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now, I'ma be in the waiting room waiting.

361
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:58,430
没人知道伟大想法的来源
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No one knows where great ideas come from,

362
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:02,110
但你总会记得灵光乍现的地点
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but you always remember where you were when they came.

363
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,780
好了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There.

364
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:07,020
{\an8\bord1\fs18\b1}包皮环切术
优缺点

365
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:07,040
而这次  我的好主意来自于这一刻
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And in this case, my great idea came the moment

366
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,220
当我走进诊室并且想到
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I entered the exam room and realized

367
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,960
我要把这个婴儿的包皮切下来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I was going to cut the foreskin off this baby's dick

368
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,190
然后交给警长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and hand it to the sheriff.

369
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,170
-他生病几天了  -就两天
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- How long has he been sick? - Just two days.

370
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:20,710
他没有发烧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He doesn't have a fever.

371
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,140
不幸中的万幸
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's a relief.

372
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,600
他的胸腔声音正常
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}His chest is clear.

373
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,310
他割过包皮了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is he circumcised?

374
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,620
-什么  -什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- What? - What?

375
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,890
对  我这个问题太蠢了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Right, how dumb of me to ask.

376
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:36,210
我就在这呢  可以直接自己检查
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm right here. I can just check myself.

377
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,970
来看看你下面是什么情况吧  小家伙
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let's see what you're packin' down there, champ.

378
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:40,030
哈里...  万德斯本格医生
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Harry... Dr. Vanderspeigle,

379
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,730
你不用这么做的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you don't need to do that.

380
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:44,870
他没有割包皮  至少现在还没有
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He's not circumcised. Not yet, anyway.

381
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:47,350
我们在考虑  但还没决定好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We were thinking about it but hadn't made a decision.

382
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,140
你不需要现在就做决定
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And you don't need to make a decision right now.

383
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,570
越早越好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The sooner the better.

384
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:54,490
割掉包皮可以降低尿路感染的风险
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Removing the foreskin reduces the risk of urinary tract infection.

385
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,890
-还有性病  -性病
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Also STDs. - STDs?

386
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,760
你想让你的孩子得淋病吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Do you want your baby getting gonorrhea?

387
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,560
-你是认真在问我吗  -不  不是的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Is that a real question? - No, it's not.

388
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,820
你应该考虑一下  那是个非常简单的手术
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You should consider it. It's a very simple procedure.

389
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:10,140
我只需要通过手术切除
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All I do is surgically remove the skin

390
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,820
包裹着你孩子老二顶端的皮肤
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}which covers the tip of your baby's prick.

391
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,860
给你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Here you go.

392
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,680
我要留着那只脚  保存好它
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm keeping the foot so it can be stored properly.

393
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,810
{\an8\bord1\fs18\b1}死者脚上取下的DNA样本

394
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,220
我没意见
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fine by me.

395
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,900
它让我的办公室闻起来一股坏寿司味
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thing made my whole office smell like bad sushi.

396
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,890
我得把这个还给丽芙
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I gotta get this back to Liv.

397
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,700
你懂的  女人都喜欢水桶
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know ladies love they buckets.

398
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:35,220
你可别说这是性别歧视  事实如此
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Before you say that's sexist, that's just a fact.

399
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:57,370
-小麦  -妈妈  你来这儿干什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Hey, Maxie. - Mom, what are you doing?

400
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:59,680
我不能被人瞧见还在和自己妈妈玩
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I can't be seen hanging out with my mother.

401
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,810
傻孩子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't be silly. Hey.

402
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,420
老师也是有午休时间的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Teachers get lunch breaks, too.

403
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:06,480
我只是顺路过来看看你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Just wanted to stop by and see how you're doing.

404
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,940
拜托快走吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Please go!

405
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,940
我可以给你钱
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'll literally pay you.

406
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,770
这钱是我早上给你的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's the money I gave you this morning.

407
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,770
那也是钱
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Money is money.

408
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:17,610
好吧  但
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay, just... Hey.

409
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,710
我只是想让你知道我爱你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I just wanted to tell you that I love you.

410
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,380
行吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay.

411
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:26,570
-我能抱抱你吗  -不行
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Can I just get a hug? - No!

412
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:29,350
行吧  再见
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay, great. Okay, bye.

413
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,920
爱你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Love you.

414
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,140
他就是那个贴外星人海报的小孩儿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Dude, that's the kid with the alien poster.

415
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:53,000
{\an8\bord1\fs18\b1}小麦
有人见过这个外星人吗
请联系小麦

416
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,850
演太空男孩儿呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What, Space Boy?

417
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,300
就是他贴的外星人海报吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He's the one with the alien posters?

418
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,500
你也是来笑话我的吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You wanna make fun of me too?

419
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,280
不
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No.

420
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,540
我相信你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Because I believe you.

421
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:17,260
压力  恐惧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Stress, fear.

422
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:20,090
难怪人类晚上会睡不着觉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No wonder humans can't sleep at night.

423
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,260
这水冷得能冻坏你的蛋
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Imagine what that water would do to your balls?

424
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:26,140
至少我不会再想那小孩或是断脚的事儿了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}At least I don't have to worry about the kid or the foot anymore.

425
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:35,310
发生什么事了  为什么你们会出现在我家湖边
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What's going on here? Why are you on my beach?

426
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,300
警察办案  医生
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's official police business, Doc.

427
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,190
尸体其他部分一定在这儿的哪个地方
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Rest of that body's got to be out there somewhere,

428
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,870
我打算找看看
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and I plan on finding it.

429
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:44,350
你们太努力了  需要休息休息
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You work too hard. You should take some time off.

430
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,900
请遵医嘱
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Doctor's orders.

431
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,310
我有点担心
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I am a little concerned about

432
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:51,920
这次行动的规模
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}the overall scale of this operation.

433
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,440
搜遍整个湖可不在我的预算范围内
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know, we don't have the budget to drag this whole lake.

434
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,070
那你的预算里包括
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You got it in your budget

435
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,560
住在一个尸体遍布的小镇上吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to live in a town littered with dead bodies?

436
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:00,550
帐可不是这样算的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Not really how budgets work.

437
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,940
整个搜查  真的太贵了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And this whole thing... It's just too expensive.

438
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,860
镇里绝对不会为零食付款的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I mean, the town is definitely not paying for snacks, okay?

439
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,590
那是克里特斯的狗粮
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Those are Cletus's dog treats.

440
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,680
别吐
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, don't be spittin' that out!

441
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,960
那可是真的野牛肉  你到底啥毛病
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's real bison meat. What the hell's wrong with you?

442
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,260
-我去  这味道像怪味花生  -听着各位
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Dang it! God, it's like a gamey peanut. - Listen,

443
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,620
在场的各位都得打起精神
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}everyone here needs to get their head in the game.

444
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,150
必须将整个湖搜个遍
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We're searching this entire lake.

445
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,100
找到尸体之前绝不停歇
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We ain't gon' stop till we find that body.

446
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,580
是的  护士
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yes, nurse.

447
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:48,470
我屁股为了供你检查
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I have very bad ass rash

448
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,310
起了一大片疹子  请吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}for you to examine, please.

449
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,400
来吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay?

450
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,400
天  吓我一跳
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, my God, you scared me.

451
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,260
行了  走吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Come on, let's go.

452
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,320
最近你总是闷闷不乐的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You've been so mopey lately.

453
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:01,800
你知道的  我朋友山姆死了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You do know my friend Sam died.

454
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,580
我知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yes, I know.

455
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,030
我知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I know, I know,

456
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:10,370
很抱歉这真的太糟糕了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and I'm very sorry and it sucks,

457
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,070
但是为了让你不再去想这件事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but maybe to get your mind off of it,

458
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:16,170
跟我出去吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you come out with me.

459
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:18,410
你这是又要带我去喂小松鼠吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You taking me to feed baby squirrels again?

460
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,710
比这更好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This is even better.

461
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:27,920
他们要是能找到尸体  我就去自杀
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They find that body, I'm gonna legit shit myself.

462
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,110
你说找点儿乐子的时候
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}When you said "Have some fun,"

463
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:33,760
我还以为是指吃顿美食或看场电影
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I thought you meant dinner or maybe a movie.

464
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,390
得了吧  这可有场直播
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Come on, we got a live show here.

465
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:40,160
万众期待得压轴大戏是出现一具被水泡胀的尸体
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The finale, fingers crossed, is a bloated, dead corpse.

466
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,630
就这了吗  一场浮尸秀
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So this is our night? A floater watch party?

467
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,070
就这个小镇来说已经很不错了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This town, I'll take what I can get.

468
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:51,750
而且  跟我约会的那个人  他鸽了我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Besides, I was dating this guy, and he sort of ghosted me.

469
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,030
完全断了联系
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I mean, he stopped calling entirely

470
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:57,180
我甚至希望那个尸体就是他的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and I'm kind of hoping that's him out there, you know?

471
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,650
有个了结
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Get some closure.

472
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:04,520
你猜我听说了什么  JT晚点有个趴
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Also, you know what I heard? JT is having a party later.

473
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,000
JT
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}JT.

474
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,210
都快忘了这号人了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I haven't thought about him in forever.

475
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,750
简直不敢相信他还住在这里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I can't believe he's still around.

476
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,590
大家都住在这里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, I mean, everybody's still around.

477
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,190
没人会离开
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Nobody gets out of here.

478
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,370
我们会的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We did.

479
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,460
一定会的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'll give us that.

480
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:22,110
我俩都能实现自己的梦想
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We both got out and chased our dreams.

481
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,860
-说得好  -是啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Damn right. - Yeah.

482
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,750
即使现实在身后追逐着我们
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And reality chased us right back.

483
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,190
没错
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah.

484
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:38,140
竟然有点儿羡慕湖里的那具死尸
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, starting to envy that body in the lake.

485
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:44,700
副警长  你怎么靠岸了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Deputy, why is your boat headed to shore?

486
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,630
镇长说他必须得回去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The mayor has to be brought back in.

487
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:50,080
他还有个会
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He has an appointment.

488
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,870
船上是有人吐了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is there somebody throwing up on that boat?

489
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,140
警长  我是镇长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Uh, hi, Sheriff. This is the mayor speaking.

490
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,520
我有个预先约定好的会
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I just have a pre-existing appoi...

491
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:03,280
你晕船了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Are you seasick?

492
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,550
我们不会就因为
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We don't halt justice

493
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,040
你肚子有点不舒服  就暂停司法
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}just 'cause your tummy's a little upset.

494
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,440
如果你想要小便  呕吐或是大便
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If you gotta piss, puke, or shit,

495
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,910
你就去船侧边解决掉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you do it over the side of the boat.

496
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,730
与此同时  我们仍按计划行事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}In the meantime, we stick to the plan.

497
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:14,120
你负责湖东边  我负责湖西边  完毕
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You do the east lake grid; I do the west lake grid. Over.

498
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,060
收到  警长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Aye-aye, Sheriff.

499
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:17,690
要不  你喝点水
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Perhaps if you drank some water?

500
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:19,720
我满嘴只有野牛味
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All I taste is bison.

501
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,980
我不喜欢这种感觉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't like this feeling.

502
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,660
甚至这条狗都让我感到紧张
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Even this dog is making me nervous.

503
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:27,760
我还记得我不知道恐惧是什么感觉的时候
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I remember when I didn't know the meaning of fear.

504
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,660
我的飞船坠毁后  我独自生活了两周
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}After my ship crashed, I was on my own for two weeks.

505
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:31,750
{\an8\bord1\fs18\b1}四个月前
新墨西哥州

506
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:36,010
外星人在一个外星球上  处处危机四伏
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}An alien on an alien planet, danger everywhere.

507
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,220
没有什么能让我担心
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}None of it concerned me.

508
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:02,930
没有恐惧感能让我做出大胆的时尚选择
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Not knowing fear allowed me to make bold fashion choices.

509
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,510
我不认为他们会找到尸体
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't think they're gonna find a body.

510
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,480
别这样  积极点
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Come on, stay positive.

511
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:52,250
那里应该是哈里的小屋
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I think that's Harry's cabin over there.

512
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:54,260
真奢华啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fancy.

513
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:58,720
我好奇当我们分手的时候  一半的小屋能值多少钱
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I wonder what half of it will be worth when we split up.

514
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,820
我记起来哈里会让我想到谁了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I remember who Harry reminds me of.

515
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,270
-谁  -丹尼·奥利弗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Who? - Danny Oliver.

516
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:10,730
-老天  是带你去毕业舞会的那个  -是的  是他
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- My God, he took you to prom. - Yes, he did, right?

517
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,990
-是他带我去的  -天呐
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Yes, he did. - Oh, God.

518
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:15,140
你还记得他跳的那支《爷钱够你花》
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You remember him dancing to "Got Your Money"?

519
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:19,020
*小淫猫*
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}*Hey, Dirty!*

520
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:22,590
*宝贝  爷钱有的是  你别担心*
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}*Baby, I got your money, don't you worry*

521
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,500
*你最好把钱都给我*
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}*You better give me that money, ooh!*

522
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,870
-我的天  -就现在
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Oh, my damn. - Right now!

523
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,050
*宝贝  给你的份爷有的是*
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}*Baby, I got your money*

524
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:29,960
-没错  -*别但心*
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Yes! - *Don't you worry*

525
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,260
*我说*
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}*Said hey*

526
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:33,730
*宝贝  爷的钱够你花*
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}*Baby, I got your money*

527
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:36,060
*我说*
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}*Hey, said hey*

528
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:39,520
*宝贝  爷钱有的是  别担心*
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}*Baby, I got your money, don't you worry*

529
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,530
警长  或许  我应该上岸  搜寻下海岸线
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sheriff, maybe I should go in and check the shoreline?

530
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:45,680
根据现状
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Based on the current,

531
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:49,070
尸体很有可能已经被水冲上岸了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}it is highly probable the body has already washed up.

532
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,960
我知道是怎么回事  镇长还是不舒服
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I know what's going on. The mayor's still sick.

533
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:54,760
你继续执行任务  副警长  我们还有具尸体要找
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You stay on mission, Deputy. We got a body to find.

534
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,970
这个人不会停手的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This guy's not going to give up.

535
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,920
我不能慌张  我只是需要一个计划
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I can't panic. I just need a plan.

536
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,240
如果他们找到了尸体
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If they find the body,

537
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,040
我就说那是我的双胞胎兄弟  弗雷德里克
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'll say it's my twin brother, Frederico.

538
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,550
花花公子  酗酒  不怎么会游泳
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Playboy, drinker, bad swimmer.

539
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,110
下来  小家伙
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Whoa. Down, boy.

540
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,630
快下来  小家伙
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Down, boy.

541
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,830
下来  这是我的尸体
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Down! This is my body.

542
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,300
这是我的尸体
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This is my body.

543
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,160
不  快放开
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, let go!

544
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,550
哈里  你在家吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Harry? Are you home?

545
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:59,980
是的  我在家  我就是站在这  啥也没做
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yes, I'm home just standing here doing nothing.

546
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:03,770
不错  看上去像是个有趣的夜晚
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, cool. Looks like a fun night.

547
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:05,200
你们在这干什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What are you doing here?

548
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,070
我们本来在沙滩上看着他们在湖里打捞
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We were down at the beach watching the lake being dragged.

549
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:10,750
就像我们小镇版的汽车电影院那样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's like our town's version of a drive-in.

550
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,370
我们可以借用一下你的厕所吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Can we use your bathroom?

551
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,430
麻烦了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Please?

552
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,940
厕所在后面
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's back there.

553
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,550
但是之后你们得立马离开
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But then you have to leave right away.

554
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:22,390
-我非常忙  -是的  我们知道  忙着闲
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- I'm very busy. - Yeah, we know, doing nothing.

555
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,820
我不喜欢他了  是非常不喜欢他了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm over him. Like, so over him.

556
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:34,290
我甚至因我喜欢过他而感到尴尬
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Like, I'm embarrassed that I was into him.

557
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,870
你为什么要翻他的东西
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Why are you going through his stuff?

558
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,320
你能以此更多的了解一个人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You can find out a lot about a guy this way.

559
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,560
他所有的维生素都有
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He's got all the vitamins.

560
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,180
维生素A B C  天呐
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}A, B, C--oh, my God.

561
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:51,350
都是按照字母表顺序储藏的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They're stored in alphabetical order.

562
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,940
他是个疯子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He's a maniac.

563
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:55,330
我太"性奋"了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm so turned on.

564
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,750
我们准备走了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We are gonna go.

565
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:09,270
你千万别进去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Do not go in there.

566
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,770
我是开玩笑的  我没有在你浴室里大便
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm just kidding. I didn't shit in your bathroom.

567
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,380
我得去参加派对了  不好意思  你没被邀请去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Gotta go to a party. Sorry, you're not invited.

568
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:18,070
差不多算是个女生之夜
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Kinda a girl's night thing, so yeah.

569
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,710
-好的  -认真的  没什么大不了的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Okay. - Seriously, it's not a big deal.

570
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:23,890
就是  我的前任  JT  他非常成功
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's just, like, my ex, JT, he's, like, really successful

571
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:27,770
他在山上有个超级大的房子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and he's got this, like, really big house in the hills

572
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:30,550
他求着我过去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and he's, like, begging me to go,

573
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:33,490
这...对他来说很尴尬
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}which...embarrassing for him, you know?

574
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,160
那我很疑惑你为什么还在这
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Then I'm confused why you're still here.

575
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,610
-快去吧  -好了  没事了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Go. - No, we're good.

576
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:41,820
我懂了  那我们下次再见
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I get it. So we'll see you another time.

577
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,240
谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thank you.

578
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:50,420
就像是他吃醋了但几乎没藏住
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's like he's jealous but barely hiding it.

579
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,510
他藏得挺好的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He's hiding it pretty well.

580
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,850
他可能会跟踪我们
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He's probably gonna follow us.

581
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:55,590
不  他不会的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, he's not.

582
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,810
-我的天呐  -你太古怪了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Oh, my God. - You're so weird.

583
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,810
姑娘们  你们带身份证了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, you girls got ID?

584
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,150
你们在这干什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, what are you doing here?

585
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:10,980
那个贱人打电话搬救兵了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This bitch called in for reinforcements.

586
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,760
达茜
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Aww, D'arce.

587
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,200
谢谢  该死的  我们开始吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thank you. Let's do the damn thing.

588
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,270
这给你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Give it to you.

589
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,370
你有更给力的东西吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Ugh, do you have anything stronger?

590
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,080
我吸了足够塞奇喝一周的奶
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Pumped Sage enough milk for a week.

591
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,830
-我要出来浪一浪  -你看起来真性感
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- I'm trying to be out‐out. - Ooh, you look hot.

592
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,450
你为什么打扮得像个黑帮老大的妻子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Ooh, why are you dressed like a mob wife?

593
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:29,410
你为什么不这么穿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Why aren't you?

594
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:32,010
我有丈夫  你只有猫
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I have a husband. You have a cat.

595
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:32,940
而且
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Besides,

596
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:35,400
这是塞奇出生以来我第一次晚上出来浪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}this is the first night I've been out since Sage was born.

597
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:39,030
我才不要穿野马队卫衣和牛仔裤
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm not gonna waste it on a Broncos jersey and jeans.

598
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,500
我看中一个人了  我想跟他
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I see somebody I wanna talk to...

599
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,570
用臀部交流感情
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}with my butt.

600
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,010
好吧

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}so maybe we could have him just kick your ass right out of here.

605
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:04,470

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Did you invite me to a high school party?

609
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:19,700

我浪费时间开了48公里车  雇了保姆
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I wasted a 30‐mile drive, a babysitter,

612
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,690
还抹上了最好的口红来到这
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and I smeared my best lipstick to be here.

613
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:27,800
-抱歉  -天啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- I'm sorry. - Oh, my God.

你跳得真好

617
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:37,170
你很苗条
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And you're skinny.

618
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:38,790
像蟋蟀一样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Like a cricket.

619
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:42,520
-你想要上楼吗  -为什么  楼上有什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- You wanna take it upstairs? - Why, what's upstairs?

00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:43,910
不不
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, no, no, no.

621

622
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:51,560
高中派对
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Ugh, high school party.

623
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:55,200

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How's your new boyfriend. You get into his Pull‐Ups yet?

624
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,610
我觉得刚才那是他第一次勃起
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I think that was his first boner.

625
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:01,170
我猜你忘了JT的儿子也叫JT
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I guess that you forgot that JT also has a son named JT?

626
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:03,880
他自恋又不是我的错
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's not my fault that he is a narcissist.

627
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,870
好吧  好吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Wow, okay, okay.

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Why? - You guys want some?

630
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:14,070
太好了  我们在Z时代毒品老巢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, great. We're in a Gen Z drug den.

631
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:16,880
那是山姆的  你是从哪搞来的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, these are Sam's. Where'd you get these?

632
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,300
我的口袋里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}From my pocket.

633
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:20,840

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Burnout, she means who gave them to you?

634
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,580
这个处方是他死后开的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This prescription was written after he died.

635
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,120
医生没有给你开这些药
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You weren't prescribed these.

636
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,780
我要把这个拿走  如果你对此有意见
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm taking them, and if you have a problem with that,

637
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,620
我要报警了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm gonna call the cops.

-这是怎么回事  -我们走吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- What was that about? - Let's just get out of here.

639
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,190

641
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,950

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How are all these children more wasted than us?

642
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:51,460
够了  我要回家去抱我的宝宝了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay, yeah, I'm going home to snuggle my baby.

643
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,800

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You two, you need families.

644
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,060
又或者是需要律师
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Or maybe a lawyer.

645
00:34:57,810 --> 00:34:58,680
真是太难为情了  帮我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This is embarrassing. Help me.

646
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,740

649
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,410
你还太年轻了  不知道那个派对到底有多糟糕
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're too young to know how sorry that party really was.

650
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,110
-谢谢  -不客气
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Thanks. - Course.

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I know you've been going through a hard time lately.

654
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,640
不管你什么时候遇到了困难
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Whenever you're having a rough time,

就烧一些雪松  给自己熏香吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}just burn some of this cedar and pull the smoke around you.

656
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:31,420
这是我爸教我的  会有帮助的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Something my dad taught me. It'll help.

657
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,250

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but we'll be back tomorrow.

671
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:06,600
有具尸体还不见着呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There's a dead body out there somewhere

672
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,910
我们找不到就誓不罢休
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and we're not gonna rest until we find it.

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay, well, there's nothing to see here.

690
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,040
至少我想吃肉时知道去哪儿找了  对吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}At least I know where I can come if I need meat, right?

691

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I thought she'd be better off without me,

702

但如果这不是真的呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but what if that's not true?

703
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:25,210

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What if--what if she's supposed to be with me?

00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,640
{\an8\bord1\fs18\b1}仓库锁

720
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,420
你到底是谁  哈里·万德斯本格
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Who even are you, Harry Vanderspeigle?

721
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,720
就是一个...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Just a...

722
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,660
人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}guy.

723
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,710
人人都有秘密
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Everybody has secrets.

724
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,370
恐惧是很好的动力
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fear is such a great motivator.

725
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,090
让人把秘密锁起来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It makes people lock those secrets away.

726
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,330
但每有一个人把秘密锁起来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But for every one person locking away their secrets,

727
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:46,230
就有两个人想发现真相
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}there are two more people seeking to uncover the truth.

728
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,940
吓人吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Scary, right?

729
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,440
好恶心
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He's disgusting.

730
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:57,500
肯定是他把你的自行车刹车弄坏的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He definitely cut the brakes on your bike.

731
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,820
我要走近看看
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I need to get a closer look.

732
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:03,530
别  别去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, don't. Don't do it.

733
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:19,600
什么鬼
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What the hell?

734
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:12,410
{\an8\bord1\fs18\b1}不友好的獾  烧烤酒吧

735
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,410
{\an8\bord1\fs18\b1}新墨西哥某地

736
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:17,210
于是我盯着那个外星人的黄眼睛
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So I look that alien son of a bitch right in his jaundiced eyes

737
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:19,090
直截了当地说道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and I said in no uncertain terms,

738
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:21,640
"别惹我"
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}"I'm not the one to mess with."

739
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:24,320
我说  "小子  我不知道你是从哪儿来的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I said, "Boy, I don't know where you're from

740
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:26,780
我他妈也不在乎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}"And I don't much give a flying duck's fart.

741
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:29,570
有一件事是肯定的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}"One thing's for certain, two things for sure.

742
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:31,870
你最好离我远点"
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You best stay the hell away from me."

743
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,770
他向我走来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, he come at me.

744
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:37,780
我一脚踢在他的屁股上  把他踢飞了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I kicked his alien ass all the way to the next county.

745
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:42,070
该死的东西顺走了我的马儿和帽子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Damn thing got away with my horse and my hat,

746
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,050
但我知道他不敢再惹我了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but I knew he wouldn't mess with me again.

747
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:48,240
难以置信  这就是为什么我们要四处旅行
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Unbelievable. See, this is why we like traveling around

748
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,930
和其他遭遇外星人的人见面
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}meeting other alien experiencers.

749
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,580
像这样的故事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Stories like that.

750
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,810
我们在网上看到你的视频
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}When we saw your videos online,

751
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:55,690
就知道一定要跟你谈谈
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}we knew we had to come speak with you.

752
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:58,760
你说你在哪儿见到外星人来着
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Where did you say you actually saw the alien again?

753
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,990
你知道他去哪儿了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Do you know where he was headed?

754
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:00,950
小娘子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, little lady,

755
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:02,500
一喝酒就打开了话匣子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I've been letting this liquor speak for me

756
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,810
我想我已经说得够多了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and I think I said too much already.

757
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:08,730
不过你可以在我的书里看到
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But you can read about that in the book I'm writing.

758
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:12,500
酷  你在写书
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, cool. You're writing a book.

759
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,050
小娘子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, well, little lady.

760
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:28,340
你干什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What are you doing--

761
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:35,990
天啊  你疯了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, my God! Are you insane?

762
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,660
你杀了他
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You killed him?

763
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:40,120
我们不应该杀人的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We're not supposed to kill people!

764
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,690
我们的任务不是这样的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Those aren't our orders!

765
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:44,400
看来我们接的是不同的任务
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Looks like you and I have different orders.
