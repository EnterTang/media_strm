1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:15,000


3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:25,500


4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:35,500


1
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:04,250
好啊 胡安!
Hey, Juan!

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,800
- 早啊 胡安! - 早啊 胡安
- Morning, Juan! - Morning, Juan.

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,430
嗨 胡安!
Hi, Juan!

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:11,620
好啊 胡安!
Hello, Juan!

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,170
这周六又可以看见他了
Another Saturday he returns.

6
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:16,680
喔 宝贝
Whoo, baby.

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,690
问候胡安 我们亲爱的园丁
Greetings, Juan the garden maker,

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,610
带来鲜花 带走杂草 
bringer of flowers, cutter of grass.

9
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,520
马克斯 你的汉堡好了
Max, your burger's ready when you are.

10
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,050
不吃了 谢谢 胡安要教我怎么除草
Oh, no, thanks. Juan's gonna teach me how to mow!

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,350
他很喜欢胡安
He loves Juan.

12
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,740
胡安确实不错
Oh, Juan's the best.

13
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:30,680
拉里 说实话 
I'm telling you, Larry,

14
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,410
你们外星人错过了很多好东西 伙计
you aliens are missing out, man.

15
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:36,040
吃培根芝士汉堡是人生的一大享受
The bacon cheeseburger is one of the finest joys of life.

16
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,760
你们这些人类不过是穿着网球鞋的猴子
You humans are just monkeys in tennis shoes.

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,890
拉里 吃点东西又能怎样? 
Larry, what would happen if you ate food?

18
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:41,550
我不知道
I have no idea.

19
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,880
察布隆人的身体极度敏感
Zabvronians' bodies are extremely sensitive.

20
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,820
怎么 你害怕吗?
What are you, afraid?

21
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,770
- 你真的是害怕啊 - 噢 马蒂
- You're afraid. - Oh! Marty...

22
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:51,540
我可是高级生命体
I am a higher life form.

23
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,190
- 激将法对我没用 - 拉里害怕了 拉里害怕了
- Taunts and threats have no effect on me. - Larry's afraid. Larry's afraid.

24
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,190
- 拉里是个... - 吃就吃!
- Larry's a... - Give it here!

25
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,520
我不喜欢
No, I don't like it.

26
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,080
跑得真爽
Great run!

27
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,050
我还是不明白我们为什么要跑步
I still don't understand why we did it.

28
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:18,720
为了好看
To look good!

29
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,860
但是你现在难看极了 是我见过的最丑的一次
But you look terrible, like the worst I've ever seen.

30
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,110
好吧 谢谢你这么说
Okay. Thanks for that.

31
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,300
不喝?
No?

32
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,930
知道吗?
Oh... You know what?

33
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,760
我觉得我该去冲个澡
I think I'm gonna take a bath.

34
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,180
没有比脱掉所有的衣服
There's nothing like stripping down

35
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,720
好好泡个热水澡更惬意的事情了
to what you were born with and having a good, hot soak.

36
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,520
肌肉也可以放松放松
It really relaxes the muscles.

37
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,670
我的肌肉一点都不酸
Well, my muscles are not sore.

38
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,330
你假装一下能死吗?
Would it kill you to act like they were?

39
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,660
我知道 很酸是不是?
I know, right?

40
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,080
脱掉所有衣服
Stripping down to what I was born with.

41
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,780
夫人!
Wife!

42
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,450
马蒂・韦弗逼我吃了一头牛!
Marty Weaver made me eat a cow!

43
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,910
夫人!我需要听众!
Wife! I demand an audience!

44
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,980
我在楼上 拉里・伯德!
I'm upstairs, Larry Bird!

45
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,280
哦 嗯 胡安?
Oh. Uh, Juan?

46
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,460
等你在地上一动不动躺够了
When you're done lying motionless on the ground,

47
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,030
你能到绕到前面
perhaps you could come round the front

48
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,550
给那些灌木浇点水吗 它们有点干了
and water the shrubbery. It's a bit dry.

49
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,400
胡安?
Juan?

50
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,640
我叫救护车了 他们马上到
I called 9-1-1. They're on their way.

51
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,600
好的 伙计们 这到底怎么回事? 
Good. Now what the hell, guys?

52
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,450
这也太诡异了!
This is really weird!

53
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,960
我也这么想 是吧?我们想叫醒他
I know, right? We tried to get his attention,

54
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,140
但是我们不会西班牙语
but we don't speak spanish.

55
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,570
我的天啊 不要碰他! 
Oh, my god, don't touch the body!

56
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,480
一定不能碰他的身体!
 You never touch the body!

57
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,060
我觉得这话已经说晚了
Well, I think it's a little late for that.

58
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,700
伙计们 胡安不是不理你们
Guys, Juan isn't ignoring you.

59
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,510
他只是...你懂得
He's... You know.

60
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,160
死了
Dead.

61
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,150
- 死了? - 是的 死了
- Dead? - Dead.

62
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,270
- 没错死了 - 那就让他别死了
- Dead. - Well, make him stop.

63
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,590
- 我们做不到 - 为什么做不到?
- We can't. - Why not?

64
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,910
好了 知道吗?
Okay, you know what?

65
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,630
马蒂 孩子们随时有可能进来!
Marty, the kids could come in any second!

66
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,760
而我们沙发上坐着个死人
We have a dead man on our sofa!

67
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,530
他不能待在这!对不起 胡安
He can't stay! I'm sorry, Juan.

68
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,280
可怜的胡安 但是他必须走!
Oh, poor Juan. He's gotta go!

69
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,280
稍等一下 我觉得这挺有意思的
Hold on a second, 'cause I find this fascinating.

70
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,450
你们不知道死亡是什么?
Do you guys not know what death is?

71
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,950
我们当然知道 自从变成人类
Of course we do. Since taking human form,

72
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,300
我们每天晚上死六个小时 
we die every night for six hours.

73
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,520
个人觉得八个小时更好
Preferably eight.

74
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,960
然后到了早上 我们再活过来 神清气爽
And in the morning, we un-die, refreshed.

75
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,710
有时候跟杰西爱爱之后我也会死一会儿 
Sometimes I die after mating with Jackie.

76
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,430
我是在做的时候死
I die during.

77
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,360
我明白了 
I see.

78
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,540
那是睡觉啊!你们说的是睡觉啊!
Sleep! You're talking about sleep!

79
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,480
而这是死亡 是生命的终结! 
This is death, the end of life!

80
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,680
杰西 不要再动胡安!
Jackie, stop touching Juan!

81
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,570
好吧 听好了 伙计们
Okay... Listen up, guys.

82
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:31,020
对于人类来说 死亡就是终结!
For humans, death is it the end!

83
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,590
就好像灯泡烧坏了再也不会亮了
It's like a light burning out that never comes back!

84
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,390
嗨 伙计们 哦 嗨 胡安
Hey, guys. Oh, hey, Juan.

85
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,190
谢谢让我玩你的车
Thanks for letting me ride in your cart.

86
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,700
小意思!
No problemo!

87
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,280
哦 我的天啊!
Oh, my god!

88
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,070
没错 我就是那么做的
Yep, I did that.

89
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,870
胡安 再见
Good-bye, Juan.

90
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,940
真不知道我们挥什么手 他又看不见
I don't know why we're waving. He can't see us.

91
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,490
因为难受 他是那么好的一个人
Because it's sad. He was a sweet man.

92
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,610
没错 他确实是
Yeah, he was.

93
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,350
看来我们得回去告诉马克斯这个坏消息了
Guess we should go break the news to Max.

94
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,590
哦 我也不想
Ohh, I don't want to, either.

95
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,050
但是马克斯喜欢胡安
But Max loved Juan.

96
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,960
你知道 他们总是在一起
You know, they spent a lot of time together.

97
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,720
胡安让他帮忙浇水
Juan let him help with the watering,

98
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,370
除草 清理除草机
pulling the weeds, emptying the mower bag.

99
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,360
你就没想过胡安是拿咱儿子当免费劳动力呢?
You ever think Juan might have been using our son for free labor?

100
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,850
马蒂 这是件很严肃的事儿 好吗?
Marty, this is a big deal, okay?

101
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,320
我是说 马克斯知道死亡是什么
I mean, Max knows about death,

102
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,140
但是他还从没有失去过这么亲近的人
but he's never had anyone close to him pass away.

103
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,430
他的爷爷奶奶都健在 也从没有死过宠物
He has all of his grandparents. He's never lost a pet.

104
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,140
我是说 至少他自己不知道
I mean, not one that he knows of.

105
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,260
是啊 那次我们火速把死掉的寄居蟹换走了
Yeah, we did pull off that impressive hermit crab switcheroo.

106
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,160
稍等一下 你认为我们可不可能...
Wait a minute. Do you think that we could possibly...

107
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,850
- 马蒂 - 没错 这不是什么好主意
- Marty. - Right. That's a bad idea.

108
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,470
好的 我们可以做到的 你知道?
Okay, we can do this, you know?

109
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,180
我们坐下来 和他好好谈谈
We'll just sit him down, have a conversation like we did

110
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,850
把他当成杰西・乔伊娜・柯西和拉里・伯德
with Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Larry Bird.

111
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,290
我们和他们谈的不错 不是吗? 
That went well, right?

112
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:37,860
是的
Yeah.

113
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,060
大限将近

114
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:52,880
啊 你们来了
Ah, there you are.

115
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,150
拉里 这到底是怎么回事?
Larry, what the hell is going on?

116
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,920
我跟他们解释了下死亡是什么
Oh, I explained death to the community,

117
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,930
然后他们问及死亡发生的具体时间
and they asked specifically when it happens,

118
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,480
而我不得不向他们承认我不知道
and I had to confess that I did not know,

119
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,110
由此引发了小小的恐慌
and it caused a bit of a panic.

120
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,950
也许你们可以解释一下?
Maybe you can clear things up?

121
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,400
不过我们需要和马克斯先谈谈
Well, actually, we need to talk to Max.

122
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,030
好极了 同志们
Excellent. Community.

123
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,150
集合
Your attention!

124
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:15,530
马蒂・韦弗将向大家解释死亡是如何
Marty Weaver will now explain how death comes...

125
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,190
在一个预先设置好的时间
At a prearranged moment,

126
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,510
当你在身体上和精神上都准备好时发生的
when you're physically and mentally prepared,

127
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:23,280
而且合情合理 公平且毫无痛苦
and it's always reasonable, fair, and painless.

128
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:24,880
马蒂
Marty.

129
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,660
好吧 实际上是这样的
Okay, here's the thing.

130
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,940
它不会在预先设置好的时间发生 好吗?
It's doesn't come at a prearranged moment, okay?

131
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,120
你也不会准备好 
And you're never prepared,

132
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,570
而且死亡也不是什么毫无痛苦的
and it is never painless.

133
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,840
也许你可以回答几个问题
Maybe you could answer some questions.

134
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,020
好吧 没问题
Yeah, okay, fine.

135
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,300
但是就几个 你 印度人
But just a couple. Uh, you, the indian one?

136
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,850
我们都会死吗?
Are we going to die?

137
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,520
我不知道 
I don't know.

138
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,610
左面第三个 裤子提到胸口的那位?
 The third from left, the pants too high?

139
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,640
既然知道你会死 你还活什么啊? 
How do you go on, Knowing you're going to die?

140
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,770
活着还有什么意义?
What's the point?

141
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,320
活着的意义在于不去考虑死亡 
The point is to enjoy life while you can

142
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,770
尽可能的享受生活
and not think about when it's going to end.

143
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,640
我们称之为否认
It's called denial.

144
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,750
就你 前面那个 矮个子双性人
You... up front, little man-woman?

145
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,480
什么是否认?
What is this denial?

146
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,980
就是让自己忙个不停
Well, it's keeping yourself busy,

147
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,230
还有其他的消遣 比如 美食 购物 啤酒
distractions... you know, food, shopping, alcohol,

148
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,620
这样你就不用考虑这种事了
So you don't have to think about things.

149
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,310
没错没错 拿我来说
Yeah, yeah, take me, for instance, okay?

150
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,070
我家里一半的人都有心脏病
Over half my family had heart attacks.

151
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:13,030
- 我想过这事儿吗? - 一次都没有!
- Does that ever cross my mind? - Not once!

152
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:16,210
相反的是 他上网打扑克 经常吃芝士汉堡
Instead, he plays computer poker and eats cheeseburgers

153
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,540
从没想过要戒掉
with reckless abandon.

154
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,730
没错 我的心脏状况很不好
Yeah, my heart's so bad,

155
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,680
实际上它跳动的时候跟哨子里的小珠子似的
it practically whistles when it beats.

156
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,390
真的吗?
It does?

157
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,920
我只是想让他们安心
Well, I just want to put their mind at ease.

158
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,190
- 配合我一下就行 - 哦 好的
- So just go with me. - Oh. Okay.

159
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,980
说实话 我的意思是如果像这样继续吃下去
I mean, honestly, if I keep stuffing my face like this,

160
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,560
五年之后我还在这的话就是奇迹了
it'll be a miracle if I'm even around in five years.

161
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,450
所以你看 说白了 我是个活死人
Look, basically, I'm a dead man walking,

162
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,900
但我觉得这没什么
and I'm okay with it.

163
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,510
他觉得这没什么
And he's okay with it.

164
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:36,370
我会死 
I'm gonna die.

165
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,650
多大点事儿啊
Big whoop.

166
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:38,950
多大点事儿啊
Big whoop.

167
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,280
你要死了?!
You're gonna die?!

168
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,950
马克斯 我们本打算和你谈谈这事儿的
Oh, Max, we were going to talk to you about this.

169
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,880
不是关于你爸 而是胡安
Not about daddy, about Juan.

170
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,910
胡安出事了?
There's something wrong with Juan?

171
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,570
嗯...
Well, um...

172
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,630
哦 我的天啊!
Oh, my gosh!

173
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,110
马克斯!
Max!

174
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,810
我真不敢相信胡安死了
I can't believe Juan died.

175
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,540
我不希望爸爸也死了
I don't want daddy to die, too.

176
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,270
亲爱的 不会的
Honey, that is not going to happen.

177
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,730
是的 我说我有哨子心 
Yeah, I only said I had a whistling heart

178
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,320
只是想让那些外星人好受点
to make the aliens feel better.

179
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,440
但是胡安死了
But Juan died.

180
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,890
没错 但是胡安已经很老了
That's true, but Juan was very old.

181
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,810
他都...
He was...

182
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,520
- 黛比 他多大了? - 四十五岁
- Debbie, how old was he? - 45.

183
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,390
四十五?!老天爷啊
45?! Oh, my god,

184
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,130
他太阳底下呆太久了
He spent a lot of time in the sun.

185
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,540
只有老人会死吗?
Only old people die?

186
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,070
- 不 - 是的
- No. - Yes.

187
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,140
- 是的 - 不
- Yes. - No.

188
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:28,470
如果你们死了 就剩我一个人了
But if you guys die, i'll be all alone.

189
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,530
嗨 如果我向你保证
Hey, what if I promised you

190
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,760
我们都会一起死呢?
that we all die at exactly the same time?

191
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,810
你会觉得好受点吗 儿子?
Would that make you feel better, sport?

192
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,910
你脑子进水了吗?
Are you nuts?

193
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,580
我怎么会觉得好受呢?
How would that make me feel better?

194
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,440
你刚刚是在让自己的儿子选择自杀还是被杀吗?
Did you just promise our son a murder/suicide pact?

195
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,810
我后悔了
I'm regretting the choice.

196
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,120
宝贝 你不需要为这些事担心
Honey, you don't have to worry about any of this.

197
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,150
没有人会死
Nobody's going to die.

198
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,020
你们都会死的
You're all going to die.

199
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,500
你们发什么神经?我们儿子被你们吓死了
What the hell was that? We got a freaked-out kid in there.

200
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,890
很抱歉打扰你们
So sorry to bother you,

201
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,730
但是我们是来谈谈一些善后事宜的
but we've come to terms with your eventual demise,

202
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,880
我们在此道别
and we are here to say farewell.

203
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,330
非常感谢 杰西 但是你有点反应过度了
Appreciate that, Jackie, But you're being a little ridiculous.

204
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,770
我反应过度?
We are being ridiculous?

205
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,040
你们才是向死亡妥协的人
You're the ones that are so accepting of death!

206
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,180
抗争啊!解决问题啊!
Fight it! Solve the problem!

207
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,880
我一生都在解决问题
I've been a problem solver my entire life.

208
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,420
我玩西洋棋很厉害 还很擅长俄罗斯方块 
I'm great at checkers. I own tetris.

209
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,640
这不过是数学而已
It's simple math.

210
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,010
你们可以活下去 你们却要死
You're capable of being alive. You die.

211
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,420
你们应该可以再活一次
You should be capable of being alive again.

212
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,310
这个问题无解
It's not a solvable problem.

213
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:24,440
事实是我们对于胡安的离世
The fact is that we were all rather taken by surprise

214
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,120
感到万分的震惊
by Juan's passing.

215
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,420
我们不希望这样的事再发生
We don't want that to happen again,

216
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,430
所以我们必须保护自己免受伤害
so we must protect ourselves from future hurt.

217
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,060
所以我们想和那些不会死去的东西做朋友
So we're thinking of becoming friends with things that don't die,

218
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,670
比如金鱼 狗啊
Like goldfish or dogs.

219
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:38,080
你们在来地球前做过调查吗?
Did you guys do any research before you came to this planet?

220
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,490
我只是好奇而已
I'm just wondering.

221
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,340
知道吗 我有个想法
You know what? I got an idea.

222
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,980
马蒂 你知道胡安的葬礼在哪举行吗?
Marty, do you know where they're having Juan's funeral?

223
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,780
是的 因为我脑子里有本葬礼信息查询表
Yes, because I have a direct feed of all funeral information that goes right into my head.

224
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,240
哦 好了 哨子心
Ah! Okay, you know what, heart whistle?

225
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,570
别再用这词儿了 好吗?
Let's lose the smart-ass remarks, okay?

226
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,040
这是件好事
It'll be a good thing.

227
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,750
他们需要理解所发生的事情
They need to process what has happened.

228
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,000
而且不仅仅是他们
And they're not the only ones.

229
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:00,990
告诉我
Tell me something...

230
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,930
你既然知道俄罗斯方块 怎么会不知道死亡呢?
How do you know about tetris, but you don't know about death?

231
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,000
殡仪馆 萨尔加多葬礼十点举行

232
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,760
好了 在我们进去之前
All right, now before we go in,

233
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,060
切记 这是一个悲伤肃穆的仪式 好吗?
remember, this is a somber event, okay?

234
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,440
- 因此几条规矩 - 问个问题!
- So a few ground rules... - A question!

235
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,520
- 为什么我们要穿成这样?
Why are we dressed like this?

236
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,390
我不知道 我特别告诉拉里
I don't know. I specifically told larry

237
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,500
不要穿成这样 他却固执己见
not to dress that way. He insisted.

238
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,050
有人告诉我这是为了庆祝胡安一生的庆典
I was told this was a celebration of Juan's life.

239
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,760
我们察布隆人总是衣着得体的参加庆典
We Zabvronians always dress appropriately for a celebration.

240
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,370
好吧好吧 是我的错
Okay, well, yeah, my bad.

241
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,250
我确实说过是"生命的庆典"
I did use the term "celebration of life."

242
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,240
但我不是说夏威夷烤猪宴
I did not mean a luau.

243
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,750
我觉得自己傻到家了
Well, I fell silly.

244
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,670
但是也没问题 说明你们关心在意
But okay, you know, it shows that you care,

245
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,840
这也就是葬礼的意义所在
and that's what this is about...

246
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,780
给认识胡安的人一个机会
Giving the people who knew Juan

247
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,370
告诉大家胡安对他们来说有多重要
an opportunity to express how important he was to them,

248
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:43,550
同时也让这些人知道即使胡安已经去世了
and then letting those people know that even though Juan is gone,

249
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:46,640
他也会永远活在他们心中
he will live in their hearts forever.

250
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,370
那些心里会永远记着胡安的人都哪去了?
So where are all these people In whose hearts Juan will live forever?

251
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,710
不好意思
Excuse me.

252
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,950
我们来早了吗?其余的人哪去了?
Do we have the wrong time? Where is everyone?

253
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,600
萨尔加多先生的妻子几年前就过世了
Mr. Salgado's wife passed several years ago,

254
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,860
他唯一的亲人是住在新不伦瑞克省的表弟
and his only family is a cousin who lives in new brunswick

255
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,860
位于加拿大 毗邻美国

256
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,610
但是他无法前来
But couldn't make the trip.

257
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,740
新不伦瑞克?
New Brunswick?

258
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,030
离这好像也就一小时的路程吧
That's, like, an hour away.

259
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,610
他们平时不怎么往来
They weren't close.

260
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,820
胡安的离开让我们意识到生命是多么的短暂
Juan's death reminds us how short life is.

261
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:22,420
也让我们意识到眼下的时光是多么宝贵
But it also reminds us how precious every moment can be...

262
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,860
来说说那个木船是什么玩意
So tell me about the wooden boat.

263
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:29,720
那不是船 是棺材 胡安的遗体躺在里面
It's not a boat. It's a coffin. It's where Juan's body is buried.

264
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:34,200
也就是说仪式结束要把船带去湖里漂走咯
And is part of the ceremony taking the boat to a lake to sail it about?

265
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,740
再声明一下 那不是船
Again, not a boat.

266
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,770
这个其实是要埋到地下去的
It actually gets buried in the ground.

267
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,640
也就是说你们埋葬你们深爱的人
So you bury the people you love,

268
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,620
却把一个填满材料的麋鹿头挂在墙上?
but a moose you just met you stuff and mount on a wall?

269
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,830
他说的有道理
He makes a good point.

270
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,870
现在请认识胡安的人和我们分享一下
This is a good time for anyone who knew Juan

271
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,890
对他的回忆
to share some words.

272
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,010
我想说几句
I'd like to say something.

273
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,020
胡安对我们意义非凡
Juan was important to us.

274
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,150
尽管我们认识他没多久
Although we did not know him for a long time,

275
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,300
他把我们的花园打理得漂漂亮亮
he kept our gardens beautiful,

276
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:10,980
对我们也很和善 我们会想念他的
and he was sweet to us, and we will miss him.

277
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,170
胡安是我们搬到这儿后最早遇到的人类之一
Juan was one of the first people we met when we moved here.

278
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,660
一开始我们以为他是和机器连在一起的
At first we thought he was attached to his machine,

279
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:20,830
类似于半人半割草机
sort of a half-man, half-mower.

280
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,450
他有一次碾过了我的脚
He once ran over my foot.

281
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:26,530
我疼死了!
Oh, yeah. It hurt!

282
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:33,280
不好意思 我刚才发觉在这里发光发热
I'm sorry, guys. I just feel that the energy expended here will be better spent

283
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,160
比费力解决死亡的问题好受多了
trying to solve this death thing.

284
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,280
这是献给你的 胡安
This is for you, Juan.

285
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,460
死亡再难也不会难过七级俄罗斯方块啊
It can't be harder than tetris level seven.

286
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,830
你在开玩笑吗?
Are you kidding me?

287
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:44,370
和飞机餐一起送来的是什么?
What is it with airplane food?

288
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,940
餐叉不会觉得尴尬吗?
Aren't forks weird?

289
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:50,180
胡安对我而言如父亲一般
Juan was like the father I never had.

290
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,380
- 啥? - 呃
- What? - Oh.

291
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,510
大家一起来为他献上一曲
Let us sing to him the song we all know.

292
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,250
我一直在铁路上工作
I've been working on the railroad

293
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:02,440
一生都是
all the live-long day

294
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:06,210
我一直在铁路上工作
I've been working on the railroad

295
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:10,510
只是为了打发时间
Just to pass the time away

296
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,700
马克斯 如果你觉得难过 这很正常
If you're sad, Max, it's okay.

297
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:14,930
男子汉可以哭
Men can cry.

298
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,240
你也知道你爹看大都会队比赛时是什么德行
You've seen daddy watch the mets.

299
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,520
谢谢你 黛比・韦弗
Thank you, Debbie Weaver.

300
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,600
你是对的 我们确实感觉好多了
You were right. We do feel better.

301
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,790
- 那你呢 小伙子?感觉好点了吗? - 嗯
- How about you, buddy? You feel better? - Yeah.

302
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:27,230
我是说 这虽然挺悲伤 但只要我记得他
I mean, it's sad, but as long as I can remember him,

303
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,520
即使见不到他也没什么关系
maybe it's okay I won't get to see him again.

304
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,270
诸位 好消息
Good news, everyone.

305
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,890
我知道如何战胜死亡了
I figured out how to beat death.

306
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,530
胡安归来
Juan has returned.

307
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,130
他让咱们的园丁起死回生了
He bought our gardener back from the dead.

308
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,520
不错 是我干的
Yes, I did.

309
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,810
我不懂
I don't understand.

310
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:57,600
你只需要知道拉里・伯德一比零战胜了死神
All you need to know is, Larry Bird 1, death 0.

311
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,600
我知道我抱怨过这鬼地方
I know I complain a lot about living in this cul-du-wack,

312
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,910
不过这确实是我见过的最奇妙的事情
but this is the greatest thing I've ever seen.

313
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,960
胡安到底是死是活?
Is Juan dead or alive?

314
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,270
- 死 - 活
- Dead. - Alive.

315
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,370
- 活 - 死
- Dead. - Alive.

316
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,490
夫君 我不太确定我对此的感受
Husband, I'm not quite sure how I feel about this.

317
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:12,950
可能是我的原因 可是胡安看起来有点...
Maybe it's just me, but Juan seems a little bit...

318
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,600
不一样
Different.

319
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,460
才没呢 他现在焕然一新
No, no, he's as good as new.

320
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,600
真的?你这么觉得?
Really? Is that what you think?

321
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,560
如果把这事传到Facebook上会怎样?
What's our policy on facebooking this?

322
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,140
嘿 大家都在看什么呐?
Hey, what's everyone looking at?

323
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,060
看瓢虫! 
A ladybug!

324
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,060
我能看看吗?
Can I see?

325
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,740
不能!它飞走了!
No! Flew away!

326
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,780
琥珀 我知道你想和艾比一起玩洋娃娃
Amber, I know you want to play dollies with Abby,

327
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,700
你妈不是在征求意见 而是命令你
your mother says, not asking, but commanding.

328
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,790
没错 既然有洋娃娃玩
Ah, yes. Why bear witness to a resurrection

329
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,720
我们还管什么起死回生的神迹啊?
when there are dolls to be played with?

330
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,540
拉里 你到底对他做了什么?
Larry, what the hell did you do to him?

331
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,380
这有什么关系?反正他复活了
What does it matter? He's back.

332
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:48,620
我还以为人死后你就再也见不到他了
I thought when someone died, you never saw them again.

333
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,330
- 先等等 马克斯 - 我不懂了
- Hold on a second, Max. - I'm confused.

334
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,250
宝贝 爸爸妈妈要先解决一些问题
Honey, mommy and daddy are trying to fix something.

335
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,670
- 已经解决了! - 来个人回答我啊!
- Fixed it! - Somebody answer me!

336
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,340
这事违反自然规律的 拉里
This is not natural, Larry.

337
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,210
你吃的大部分食物也不合自然规律
Well, neither is most of the food that you eat,

338
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,450
- 可你不还是挺享受的 - 他说得有道理
- but you seem to enjoy that. - He's got a point.

339
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,660
别把我吃什么扯进来! 
Don't bring my food into this!

340
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,040
你的饮食习惯和野兽没啥区别
You eat like an animal.

341
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,480
嘿 胡安
Hey, Juan.

342
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,630
我有好多事情不懂
I'm confused about a bunch of things.

343
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,980
你能回答我几个问题吗?
Will you answer some questions?

344
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,110
你死了吗?你见到上帝了吗?
Are you dead? Did you meet god?

345
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,090
你去过天堂了吗?
Did you go to heaven?

346
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:15,310
会不会很疼?那里黑吗?
Did it hurt? Was it dark?

347
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,970
你有没有见到我的寄居蟹?
Did you see my hermit crab?

348
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,880
我爸妈说就是现在的那只
My parents say it's the same one,

349
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,650
不过我深表怀疑
but I'm suspicious.

350
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,760
大家都死了吗?
Does everyone die?

351
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,290
还是说没有人死?你死了
Does no one die? You died.

352
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,550
我爸爸也快死了吗?
Is my dad going to die?

353
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,670
拉里 我知道现在气氛很紧张
Okay, Larry, I know tempers are high,

354
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:34,090
但是你不能说我丈夫是猪脑子
but it is not appropriate to call my husband a poopy-head.

355
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,510
- 他本来就是 - 我才不是
- Well, he is. - I am not.

356
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:38,400
- 傻子说傻话 - 拉里 你必须把胡安弄回他应有的状态
- Are, too. - Larry, you have to put Juan back the way he was.

357
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,150
我已经解决了死亡这个难题
Look, I have solved the problem of death.

358
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,790
- 接受我的大礼吧 - 拉里・伯德 你必须告诉我们真相
- Accept it as a gift. - Larry Bird, you need to tell them the truth.

359
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,940
- 真相是什么? - 真相是你老公是猪脑子
- What is the truth? - That your husband is a poopy-head.

360
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,970
拉里・赫伯特・沃克尔・伯德!
Larry Herbert Walker Bird!

361
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,560
他什么也没有解决 他都不知道自己是怎么做到的
He hasn't solved anything. He doesn't even know how he did it.

362
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,660
我知道!
I do know how I did it!

363
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,810
只是再也做不了了而已
I just can't do it again.

364
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,250
拉里 你们在说什么?
Larry, what are you talking about?

365
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,680
在我来这个星球之前 我父亲给了我一小瓶药
Before I came to this planet, my father gave me one vial of medicine,

366
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:04,980
他告诉我 除非万不得已 否则不能喝它
and he told me, should the worst happen, only then should I use it.

367
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,240
当时我不懂他什么意思 但是胡安一死我就明白了
And I didn't know what he was talking about until Juan died.

368
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:12,860
拉里 你只有一瓶药 而你把它给了胡安?
Larry, you only had one, and you used it on Juan?

369
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,150
- 你把它用给了胡安? - 事情就这样发生了
- You used it on Juan? - It just happened!

370
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:20,080
我当时...站在胡安的棺材船旁边
I was... standing next to Juan's coffin boat...

371
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,750
- 再说一次 不是船 - 先别纠正
- Again, not a boat. - Not the time.

372
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:25,100
有种难以名状的感觉淹没了我
And this indescribable wave of emotion came over me, and...

373
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,950
哦 拉里 这叫悲伤
Oh, Larry, it's called sadness.

374
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,700
这很正常
It's natural.

375
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,450
不过接下来的事就不叫正常了 
Just what came after was not.

376
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,610
不 不是悲伤
No, I didn't feel sad.

377
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,730
我觉得很无力
I felt powerless.

378
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,650
对
Yes.

379
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,320
我 伟大的拉里・伯德
I, the great Larry Bird,

380
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,210
感到无力
powerless.

381
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,110
你们没什么反应?
Really? Nothing?

382
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:49,390
- 无力啊 - 我被吓呆了 难以置信
- Powerless, yeah. - Shocking. I can't believe it. Wow.

383
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:50,800
问题在于
The thing is,

384
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:54,830
我和我夫君还不是很懂人类身体怎样运作
my husband and I still don't quite understand how these bodies work.

385
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:57,750
自从变成人类 我们也得睡觉
Since taking human form, we now sleep.

386
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:00,510
要是我们也...死了怎么办?
What if we now also... die?

387
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,270
好吧
Okay.

388
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:06,320
打扰一下 年幼的马克斯・韦弗正坐在你家屋顶上
Excuse me. Young Max Weaver is sitting on your roof.

389
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,580
什么?
What?

390
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,300
马克斯 你在上面做什么?!
Max, what are you doing up there?!

391
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,120
没人愿意和我说话
Nobody will talk to me.

392
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:19,250
我很迷惑 我有好多问题 我才八岁
I'm confused. I have questions. And I'm 8.

393
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,530
我现在想和妈妈谈谈
I want to talk to mommy now.

394
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,900
没问题 马克斯 妈妈马上就来
All right, Max, mommy's coming.

395
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:31,320
嘿 你们没事吧?你俩在那儿呆了好久了
Hey. You guys okay? You've been out here a long time.

396
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,020
马克斯和我还没聊完呢
Max and I have been hanging.

397
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:38,430
关于为什么有些问题这么复杂还有...
Talking about how all this has been confusing and how...

398
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,120
死亡怎么这么复杂
death is confusing.

399
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,750
不过他现在冷静多了
But he's calmer now.

400
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:45,610
我告诉他他今晚可以问我们
And I told him that tonight he can ask us

401
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:48,050
所有他有疑惑的问题
anything he wants to about all of this,

402
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,830
而我们会尽量告诉他真相 即使真相会很忧伤
and that we would try to answer truthfully, even if it's sad.

403
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:53,050
这样的话你就会好多了 小伙子?
Yeah? That make you feel better, kiddo?

404
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,030
对
Yeah.

405
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,010
好 那我们干嘛不去里面聊
Okay, so why don't you head on inside,

406
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,410
你躺在床上
you get ready for bed,

407
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,440
我们去找你 然后我们深入探讨一下死亡的话题
and then we'll come in and we'll have a nice, long conversation about death,

408
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,730
然后你就可以进入梦乡了
and then it's off to dream land.

409
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,560
- 待会儿见 - 当心点
- See you in there, buddy. - Just be careful. Okay.

410
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,600
好了 准备好了吗?数三下 一 二 三!
All right. Ready? On 3. 1, 2, 3!

411
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,440
亲娘咧!
Oopsie-daisy!

412
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,560
你没事吧?
You okay?

413
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,910
马蒂 我不喜欢你每天都吃芝士汉堡
Marty, I don't like that you eat cheeseburgers every day,

414
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,910
也不喜欢你拿你的哨子心开玩笑
and that you make jokes about your whistling heart.

415
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,100
我不想让你变成胡安那样
I don't want you to end up like Juan

416
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,110
不管是拉里动手前还是动手后的那种
before Larry got to him... or after, for that matter.

417
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:33,630
好啦 听我说好吗?
All right, listen to me, okay?

418
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,760
你一定要记得
There's something that you need to know.

419
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,180
我哪儿也不去
I'm not going anywhere.

420
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,100
除非是海豹突击队
It would take a team of navy S.E.A.L.S.

421
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,060
带着一队海豹亲自来
with a team of real seals

422
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,540
才可能把我从你和孩子们身边拖走
to drag me away from you and the kids.

423
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,800
明白吗?
Okay?

424
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,380
好 不过答应我以后偶尔吃点沙拉什么的
Okay. But promise me you'll try to eat a salad every once in a while,

425
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,580
或者和我一起去慢跑
and maybe you'll jog with me.

426
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,560
我以我的哨子心起誓
I cross my whistling heart.

427
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,460
好吧 这样说不好笑 我以后不会再说了
Okay, that's not even funny. I'gonna stop saying that.

428
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,380
最后一次了 好吧
Last time. Okay.

429
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,620
你还好吧?
You okay?

430
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,830
自从你把胡安安顿好后就一直坐在这儿了
You've been out here ever since you put Juan in the shed for the night.

431
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,740
我没事
I'm fine.

432
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,840
那就好
Okay.

433
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,330
我理解你
You know, I get you.

434
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:35,990
今天这么离奇 不过以后也许会变成好事
I mean, sometimes the best thing you can do after a crazy day like this

435
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:38,760
就这样坐在路边
is just sit on the curb

436
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,550
让黑夜洗去一切
and let the night wash over you.

437
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:43,440
马蒂 我不知道如果你...
Marty, I don't know if you...

438
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,150
只是...
It's just...

439
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:48,800
我以前可以解决各种问题
I've always been able to solve any problem.

440
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:51,270
在我们来这里之前
And we were prepared for some uncertainty

441
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,190
我们对未知尽量做了些准备
when we came to this planet.

442
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:56,200
我的孩子还不怎么了解这个世界
And my children really don't know this world.

443
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,090
而且...
And...

444
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:03,010
如果杰西和我出了什么事...
if anything should happen to Jackie and me...

445
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:06,130
虽然这只是也许 可是作为父亲...
Not that it can or will, but as a father, it...

446
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,910
嘿 嘿
Hey. Hey.

447
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:11,140
会有人照顾你的孩子们的
Your children will be taken care of.

448
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,730
好了吗?
Okay?

449
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,130
谢谢
Thank you.

450
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,470
不过你也得考虑到
You should probably know that

451
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:24,310
万一你 我 黛比 还有杰西出了什么事...
if anything happens to you and Debbie, Jackie and I...

452
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,270
还有我妹妹呢
My sister's on it.

453
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,060
所以没问题的
So it's okay.

454
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:30,780
不过还是谢谢你关心 谢谢
But thank you. Thanks.

455
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,580
好了好了 时候到了
Okeydokey, it's time.

456
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,420
嘿 老兄 时间差不多了
So, uh, hey, buddy. It's time.

457
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,370
出发去新不伦瑞克了
Huh? Off to New Brunswick.

458
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:53,300
我想你表弟看到你一定会大吃一惊
I think your cousin's gonna be pretty surprised to see you.

459
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,480
你钱带够了吗?
You got enough, uh, cash to last?

460
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,000
我知道拉里一向慷慨
I know that Larry was very generous.

461
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,850
好吧 你该走了
Okay. Here you go.

462
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:10,150
我羡慕你即将面对的冒险
I envy you the adventure that awaits you,

463
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,520
胡安・萨尔加多
Juan Salgado.

464
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,960
多保重 好好享受这个世界
Be good. Enjoy the world.

465
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,590
记住 这种事我只能做一次
Remember, I was only able to do this once.

466
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,690
不要让我失望
Earn it.

467
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,400
好了好了
All right. Okay. All right.

468
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,270
让他走吧 他得走了 好了
Let him go now. He's gotta go. Okay.

469
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,710
马蒂 有关你孩子的监护权
Marty, about the guardianship of your children...

470
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,050
排在我们前面的有多少人?
How many people are ahead of us?

471
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,110
除非我们认识的所有人都死了你才有可能
Pretty much everyone we know would have to die.

472
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:41,600
也就是说我们还有机会了?
Oh, so we have a chance?

473
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,140
外

474
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:30,140
星

475
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,140
邻

00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,140
