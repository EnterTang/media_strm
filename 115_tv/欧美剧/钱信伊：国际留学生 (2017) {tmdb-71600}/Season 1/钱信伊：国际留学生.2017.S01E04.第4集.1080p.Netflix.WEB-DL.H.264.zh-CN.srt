00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,200
Hi,Mike

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,560
Are you studying again?

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,150
Do you realize how depressing that is to come home to?

4
00:00:08,502 --> 00:00:10,502
As depressing as coming home to an empty lasagna tray?

5
00:00:12,703 --> 00:00:13,803
Touch? michael.

6
00:00:15,604 --> 00:00:18,704
It's just a reminder of the fact that I have no social life out here.

7
00:00:19,405 --> 00:00:20,405
I'm having  the worst dry spell ever.

8
00:00:20,306 --> 00:00:22,306
My dry spell's lasted 20 years, but go on.

9
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:27,007
I mean, in new york, if you see a pretty girl, you can just walk right up to her, you know?

10
00:00:27,308 --> 00:00:31,308
But here, they're all in cars. They go whipping past me at, like, a million miles an hour.

11
00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:35,309
You know, like today, I saw this pretty girl driving toward me,

12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,210
so I make a u-turn ,and get a ticket for 800 bucks!

13
00:00:40,211 --> 00:00:42,311
$800 for a u-turn?

14
00:00:42,612 --> 00:00:43,512
Yeah.

15
00:00:44,313 --> 00:00:46,213
We may have been on a freeway at the time, but...

16
00:00:49,314 --> 00:00:51,514
I just wish I had a regular place where I could go and meet women

17
00:00:52,515 --> 00:00:53,915
Well, you could go to bars.

18
00:00:54,116 --> 00:00:55,616
No, I'm getting too old for that.

19
00:00:56,417 --> 00:00:59,217
Plus, I'm not great at telling whether or not they're gay bars before I go in.

20
00:01:01,218 --> 00:01:03,218
Oh, by the way, if ramon calls, I am not here

21
00:01:05,562 --> 00:01:08,262

Joey 104
Enjoy！

21
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:39,329
Hey

22
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,320
Joey, come here .Look at this.

23
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:42,621
The world is a freakin' joke

24
00:01:45,322 --> 00:01:48,222
Cargo pants are five minutes ago? The world is a freakin' joke!

25
00:01:49,823 --> 00:01:51,823
No, the thing about the celebrity hairstylist.

26
00:01:52,224 --> 00:01:54,124
I went to cosmetology school with that girl

27
00:01:54,325 --> 00:01:57,425
She burned way more hair than I did, and I burned some hair.

28
00:02:00,226 --> 00:02:03,226
And now I have to read about her living the glamorous life, and rubbing elbows with celebrities.

29
00:02:04,027 --> 00:02:05,027
That should be me.

30
00:02:05,328 --> 00:02:06,428
You cut my hair. I'm on tv

31
00:02:06,929 --> 00:02:07,129
No offense

32
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,230
but you're only slightly more famous than my client who shot her husband.

33
00:02:13,001 --> 00:02:14,531
Hello, giant plate of sandwiches

34
00:02:16,232 --> 00:02:17,332
Joey, listen...

35
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,003
oh, hey, michael. Didn't even see you there.

36
00:02:21,234 --> 00:02:21,934
Hands off.

37
00:02:22,235 --> 00:02:23,035
These are for my book club tonight

38
00:02:24,036 --> 00:02:25,336
A book club here,

39
00:02:26,037 --> 00:02:26,737
in my own home?

40
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:29,038
God, it's like I'm living at the playboy mansion.

41
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:32,039
Stay away from the sandwiches. Watch him, mom.

42
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,540
I can't believe this.

43
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:45,821
It's so upsetting when people with less talent than you are more successful.

44
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:48,242
Yeah, like that dog from my beer commercial.

45
00:02:48,743 --> 00:02:51,043
Couldn't catch a frisbee on cue. Works all the time.

46
00:02:52,904 --> 00:02:54,344
You should ask your agent to hook me up.

47
00:02:55,045 --> 00:02:57,045
She has lots of famous clients that need to get their hair done

48
00:02:57,846 --> 00:02:59,646
Just show her my portfolio. I am sure she will be impressed

49
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,347
Well, I can show it to her, but I'm not so sure she'll be impressed.

50
00:03:02,748 --> 00:03:05,048
All the hairstyles are modeled by michael-- even the women'S

51
00:03:06,749 --> 00:03:07,249
So?

52
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,450
So,that dorothy hamill haircut with the heavy makeup?

53
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:13,151
We're lucky he's not burying bodies in the backyard.

54
00:03:19,352 --> 00:03:19,652
Joey

55
00:03:20,103 --> 00:03:20,853
what are you doing here?

56
00:03:21,653 --> 00:03:23,353
Why aren't you out there getting work?

57
00:03:25,254 --> 00:03:26,554
Uh, I didn't have any auditions today.

58
00:03:26,955 --> 00:03:29,855
Oh, sure, put it all on me

59
00:03:31,356 --> 00:03:31,656
What's that?

60
00:03:32,357 --> 00:03:34,457
Oh, it's a portfolio of hairstyles.

61
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:35,458
what?

62
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:41,659
Oh! Who's the model?

63
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,760
Oh, I'd like to keep that little piece of chicken in my pocket and snack on him all day

64
00:03:53,061 --> 00:03:53,861
Uh, that's my nephew.

65
00:03:54,262 --> 00:03:56,262
Oh, we can see who has the looks in your family

66
00:03:58,863 --> 00:03:59,263
Anyway,

67
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,864
my sister is a hairdresser

68
00:04:01,965 --> 00:04:05,465
that's her portfolio I was hoping maybe you could show it to some of your clients.

69
00:04:07,466 --> 00:04:08,966
Oh, absolutely.

70
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:15,896
Hi, halle berry?

71
00:04:16,897 --> 00:04:19,897
My client has a sister who's a barber.

72
00:04:22,398 --> 00:04:24,698
Could she do your hair for the oscars?

73
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,000
What did she say?

74
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:30,600
Joey,

75
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:33,301
I'm not here to do you personal favors.

76
00:04:33,902 --> 00:04:35,902
Let me explain how this agent thing works.

77
00:04:36,803 --> 00:04:39,003
First you become famous, and then

78
00:04:39,504 --> 00:04:41,204
I'll kiss your ass.

79
00:04:43,605 --> 00:04:46,205
But until then, let's keep it strictly professional.

80
00:04:46,606 --> 00:04:47,306
Okay.

81
00:04:47,507 --> 00:04:48,907
Sorry. I understand.

82
00:04:49,908 --> 00:04:51,508
Leave the pictures of the boy toy.

83
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:01,309
Well, hello.

84
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,010
Are you here for book club?

85
00:05:03,911 --> 00:05:04,311
I am now.

86
00:05:06,312 --> 00:05:07,412
What did you think of this week's book?

87
00:05:09,213 --> 00:05:11,413
I... found it extremely fictional

88
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:15,614
Uh, joey, joey, can I just talk to you for one second?

89
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:16,815
Uh, yeah.

90
00:05:17,616 --> 00:05:18,116
Sorry.

91
00:05:21,217 --> 00:05:22,017
What are you doing?

92
00:05:22,318 --> 00:05:24,218
You didn't tell me there were pretty ladies in the nerd club.

93
00:05:26,019 --> 00:05:26,519
You got to let me in.

94
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,020
Look, I don't know.

95
00:05:28,221 --> 00:05:28,921
Hey, come on, michael.

96
00:05:29,222 --> 00:05:31,022
You can't keep me out of a room full of women.

97
00:05:31,223 --> 00:05:34,023
If I was in charge of a room full of boring stuff, I'd let you in.

98
00:05:35,224 --> 00:05:37,624
This isn't one of those book clubs where people come to mingle, all right?

99
00:05:38,525 --> 00:05:40,825
It's a place to discuss literature, not pick up girls.

100
00:05:41,526 --> 00:05:42,826
Oh, my god, jane's here. Jane.

101
00:05:44,627 --> 00:05:45,327
Hi, michael. I brought an ice cream cake.

102
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,628
That's great. It's great to see you.

103
00:05:46,829 --> 00:05:48,629
Uh, great book, huh?

104
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,730
So great. It was little slow at the beginning,

105
00:05:51,931 --> 00:05:53,831
but great overall.Did you think it was great?

106
00:05:55,032 --> 00:05:56,432
The cake is cold. My hands are getting numb.

107
00:06:02,533 --> 00:06:04,433
Not a place to pick up girls ,huh?

108
00:06:05,534 --> 00:06:07,734
What, jane? No way. No, are you kidding?

109
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:09,135
No, I would never...

110
00:06:09,206 --> 00:06:12,828
great, great, g-great, great, g-g-great, great, great, g-g-g-g-great, great

111
00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:13,150
all right.

112
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:15,238
I love her so much.

113
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,039
So, so, ask her out.

114
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,040
No, book club has a strict no-datingule, and I'm the president.

115
00:06:21,241 --> 00:06:25,041
She's my vice-president. The scandal would tear our administration apart.

116
00:06:26,242 --> 00:06:29,342
Michael, you have to seize this moment.

117
00:06:29,943 --> 00:06:32,543
he love between two nerds is a rare and fragileT thing.

118
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,344
I want to. I can't go against the rules

119
00:06:36,545 --> 00:06:37,545
without a motion being passed.

120
00:06:37,746 --> 00:06:39,046
So, I'll make a motion.

121
00:06:39,117 --> 00:06:40,847
You're not a member. There's an approval process.

122
00:06:41,348 --> 00:06:43,248
Well, I motion you suspend it on account of me 

123
00:06:42,348 --> 00:06:46,848
being the sole payer of rent for the book club's headquarters.

124
00:06:47,049 --> 00:06:48,649
I second the motion. The motion is passed.

125
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,050
I motion for a presidential exemption to the no-dating rule.

126
00:06:52,151 --> 00:06:53,751
I second the motion; the motion is passed.

127
00:06:53,952 --> 00:06:56,552
I motion that you and me eat that entire ice cream cake right now!

128
00:06:58,223 --> 00:06:59,203
Motion denied!

129
00:06:59,554 --> 00:07:00,504
Mr. Chairman, you're out of order!

130
00:07:06,455 --> 00:07:07,755
Great book club tonight.

131
00:07:08,256 --> 00:07:09,456
Lively discussion,

132
00:07:09,667 --> 00:07:10,357
and I got five phone numbers.

133
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:13,658
Yeah, the girls were crazy about you.

134
00:07:14,359 --> 00:07:15,159
What's your secret?

135
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,460
There's no trick.

136
00:07:16,861 --> 00:07:18,261
Women just want to be listened to.

137
00:07:19,062 --> 00:07:21,062
So, when they talk, I pretend to listen and go like this.

138
00:07:25,363 --> 00:07:26,963
Hey, so, how'd it go with jane?Did you ask her out?

139
00:07:27,564 --> 00:07:30,264
No, I want to wait till next week's meeting so I can set the mood.

140
00:07:31,265 --> 00:07:33,665
So, I picked a romantic book, and I asked her to come over right

141
00:07:33,766 --> 00:07:35,766
 before to help me write out the discussion questions.

142
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,466
Nice, nice. What's the book?

143
00:07:39,067 --> 00:07:40,067
Jane austen's pride and prejudice.

144
00:07:40,268 --> 00:07:43,568
It's a tale of manners and courtship set in 19th century rural england.

145
00:07:44,369 --> 00:07:45,569
I hope you enjoy reading that.

146
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,370
Joey,

147
00:07:47,371 --> 00:07:49,371
if you're going to be in this book club, you have to read the book.

148
00:07:50,172 --> 00:07:51,872
The whole notion of... stop that!

149
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:54,573
 Stop it!

150
00:07:56,674 --> 00:07:56,974
Hey, guys.

151
00:07:56,975 --> 00:07:57,975
Hi, mom.

152
00:07:58,905 --> 00:08:00,475
So, is your agent going to send me any clients?

153
00:08:01,476 --> 00:08:04,876
Uh, no. Actually, bobbie's been very busy, so I don't know if you should expect a call.

154
00:08:05,177 --> 00:08:05,577
Your agent?

155
00:08:06,078 --> 00:08:06,578
She did call.

156
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,309
Really?

157
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,780
Yeah, it was weird. She called me her little chicken nugget, then made a bunch of slurping noises.

158
00:08:14,481 --> 00:08:16,281
That's just showbiz talk 

159
00:08:17,382 --> 00:08:19,182
I can't believe you don't know anyone famous.

160
00:08:19,383 --> 00:08:22,783
If you hadn't turned down that hit show you'd have so many connections that could help me right now.

161
00:08:23,484 --> 00:08:25,684
Yeah, that's what I regret most about that decision.

162
00:08:27,685 --> 00:08:30,585
hey, I'm sorry to bug you, but, uh, did you get some of my mail by mistake?

163
00:08:30,686 --> 00:08:33,886
I didn't get my people magazine and the post office said they delivered it today.

164
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,087
Gina, weren't you reading that earlier?

165
00:08:39,488 --> 00:08:41,488
What's the problem? I'm not good enough to steal your magazine?

166
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,589
Alex, I think it's upstairs. Have a seat.

167
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,290
No, that's okay. You don't have to leave us alone.

168
00:08:50,751 --> 00:08:51,991
So, tell me, do you...?

169
00:08:52,092 --> 00:08:53,892
This isn't a social hour. What famous people
you know?

170
00:08:56,393 --> 00:08:58,093
Oh. Well, um, my college friend jessica

171
00:08:58,494 --> 00:09:00,924
is married to a big-time movie producer.

172
00:09:01,225 --> 00:09:04,625
So, does she wear really expensive gowns and get her hair all done up and go to big premieres?

173
00:09:05,026 --> 00:09:07,176
Yeah, all the time. She goes to one every week.

174
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:10,227
Oh, you're lying to impress me.

175
00:09:11,228 --> 00:09:13,528
No, I'm not lying. She's a really good friend of mine.

176
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:16,929
Yeah, right. I'd like to see you ask her to let me do her hair for her next premiere.

177
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:18,430
All right, I will.

178
00:09:18,731 --> 00:09:20,221
Wait, what just happened?

179
00:09:21,532 --> 00:09:23,532
I'm really good, I swear. I just need a chance.

180
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:26,133
If you call her and set it up, I'll be nice to you.

181
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:28,534
For how long?

182
00:09:30,435 --> 00:09:31,235
Name your terms.

183
00:09:31,336 --> 00:09:31,936
Two weeks.

184
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:32,223
Done.

185
00:09:32,824 --> 00:09:33,524
I should have said three.

186
00:09:33,925 --> 00:09:35,025
Now you're down to one.

187
00:09:34,226 --> 00:09:35,226
oh

188
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:42,897
Hey.

189
00:09:43,228 --> 00:09:43,500
Hello.

190
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,529
Tonight at book club, don't have diane sit next to maureen.

191
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,230
Why?

192
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:50,231
I may be dating both of them exclusively.

193
00:09:53,532 --> 00:09:54,232
oh, my god, that's jane.

194
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:58,000
All right, I'll get out of your hair until book club startsI'll be in my room reading the book

195
00:09:58,001 --> 00:10:00,451
and listening to some soft rock hits of the '70s

196
00:10:00,452 --> 00:10:02,346
Can you believe someone threw this out?

197
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:07,750
Hi.

198
00:10:09,152 --> 00:10:11,787
Whoa! Uh, come in. I'm sorry. You just, you look great.

199
00:10:12,355 --> 00:10:14,055
Thanks. You look... I don't know.

200
00:10:14,256 --> 00:10:17,003
I can't see without my glasses.

201
00:10:18,157 --> 00:10:19,357
I probably shouldn't have driven here.

202
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:23,658
So, uh...

203
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,359
did you enjoy the book?

204
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:27,960
Oh, yeah.

205
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:29,561
It's pretty romantic.

206
00:10:31,062 --> 00:10:31,462
Very.

207
00:10:33,063 --> 00:10:33,803
So, I wanted to ask you...

208
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,004
Don't mind me! Just grabbing a snack.Reading makes me hungry

209
00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:40,005
I'm sorry. He'S... um, so...

210
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:41,266
just call me angel of the morning, angel

211
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:47,067
just touch my cheek before you leave...

212
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:55,568
so, I was, I was just thinking that maybe we could...

213
00:10:55,869 --> 00:10:57,369
loosen up the rules of book club.

214
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,470
Oh, okay.

215
00:10:58,671 --> 00:11:02,271
Like maybe we could strike the no-dating rule from the bylaws?

216
00:11:02,472 --> 00:11:03,272
Oh, yes, let's do that!

217
00:11:03,673 --> 00:11:05,173
Okay. Consider it stricken.

218
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:06,974
Okay, great. So, we can date people in book club?

219
00:11:07,475 --> 00:11:08,605
Yes, we can.

220
00:11:10,016 --> 00:11:10,947
So, what's up with your uncle?

221
00:11:12,077 --> 00:11:12,277
I'm sorry?

222
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:15,678
Do you think he would go out with me?

223
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:18,679
He mentioned he was single last time, and I was hoping you could say something for me

224
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,080
I'm going to go read in the courtyard!

225
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,381
Give you two some privacy.

226
00:11:33,682 --> 00:11:35,522
Four down, 371 to go.

227
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:37,383
Hey.

228
00:11:37,584 --> 00:11:37,999
Hey.

229
00:11:38,784 --> 00:11:40,284
I just wanted to tell you guys to be sure to watch tv tonight.

230
00:11:40,485 --> 00:11:43,985
I just did alex's frand she's going to be on the red carpet.iend's hair for a premiere,

231
00:11:44,486 --> 00:11:44,986
Oh, how did it go?

232
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:48,487
Oh, I was a little nervous at first. She's a very fancy lady.

233
00:11:48,988 --> 00:11:52,188
She was drinking martinis, and sitting with her legs crossed.

234
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:56,089
But then I got into it, and instinct just took over.

235
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,990
I did this beautiful old hollywood style up-do.

236
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,957
Congratulations. All right!

237
00:12:01,392 --> 00:12:01,992
I'm gonna go tell michael.

238
00:12:02,393 --> 00:12:04,093
No, no, no no, no, no, no. He's in there with a girl.

239
00:12:04,895 --> 00:12:08,895
Okay, he's in there with a girl, and you're reading books?
What is this, freaky friday?

240
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,806
All right. I guess I'll go tell blondie how it went.

241
00:12:12,097 --> 00:12:14,256
Uh, call her alex. You promised you were gonna be nice.

242
00:12:14,798 --> 00:12:17,508
Yeah, only one more day of that, and some stuff is gonna happen.

243
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,899
five minutes left. I got to buckle down.

244
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,000
Hey, little snail!

245
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:29,600
Hi, joey.

246
00:12:31,311 --> 00:12:33,902
Diane. Maureen. Uh, you two know each other?

247
00:12:34,203 --> 00:12:35,203
Oh, yeah, we're good friends.

248
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:36,804
I did not know that.

249
00:12:38,005 --> 00:12:38,605
Come on in.

250
00:12:42,106 --> 00:12:42,906
Hi, joey.

251
00:12:43,007 --> 00:12:43,507
What's up?

252
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:50,008
listen, michael, I didn't exactly finish the book, okay? So, don't call on me.

253
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:51,509
You're unbelievable.

254
00:10:58,510 --> 00:12:52,610
What?

255
00:10:59,511 --> 00:11:00,511
Come here.

256
00:12:56,812 --> 00:12:58,112
What's the matter?Did you ask jane out?

257
00:12:58,313 --> 00:13:00,430
 No, I didn't ask her out, 'cause she wants to go out with you!

258
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,614
Oh, dude, I'm so sorry. Ob-obviously, I would never...

259
00:13:04,715 --> 00:13:06,005
you totally screwed this up for me!

260
00:13:06,516 --> 00:13:08,416
But I didn't mean to. I barely said two words to her.

261
00:13:08,517 --> 00:13:13,117
You didn't have to. You came to last week's meeting with your game face on,looking to score, and it worked, all right?

262
00:13:13,218 --> 00:13:16,418
You're like a big blob of sex, and you...

263
00:13:16,819 --> 00:13:19,000
you oozed your charm all over the girl I like.

264
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,440
I am not a sex blob. Okay?

265
00:13:22,441 --> 00:13:26,400
And this is not my fault! Look, I'm sorry if she likes me, but I didn't do anything wrong.

266
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,600
I should never have let you in.

267
00:13:30,823 --> 00:13:32,023
Uh, should we get started?

268
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,824
 Come, joey,let's go talk about the book we all read.Yes.

269
00:13:35,225 --> 00:13:35,825
Okay, nothing past page four.

270
00:13:49,026 --> 00:13:51,026
Hey, I wanted to call and tell you what a great time...

271
00:13:51,327 --> 00:13:54,027
uh, book club is starting, everybody. Book club! Hee-hee. Book club.

272
00:13:55,328 --> 00:13:57,028
Okay, so, who wants to start?

273
00:13:57,109 --> 00:13:58,009
I thought...

274
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,700
joey, what did you think of pride and prejudice?

275
00:14:01,801 --> 00:14:03,431
Let's hear it. What were some of the central themes?

276
00:14:11,002 --> 00:14:12,132
Uh... uh, well, pride was one.

277
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:12,733
Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

278
00:14:15,134 --> 00:14:17,634
And, of course, prejudice, which is wrong.

279
00:14:20,035 --> 00:14:21,905
Uh, uh-huh. And what did you think of darcy?

280
00:14:22,006 --> 00:14:22,936
She was good.

281
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,037
Darcy's a man.

282
00:14:25,338 --> 00:14:26,738
But not in the modern sense

283
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:28,987
Is that what you're saying, joey?

284
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,540
Uh, yes, it is. Yes, it is, maureen. Thank you.

285
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:35,841
that's interesting.

286
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:38,042
That's very interesting.

287
00:14:40,642 --> 00:14:42,642
Look, he didn't read the book! The only reason he's here is to pick up women!

288
00:14:40,643 --> 00:14:44,243
Now, in the interest of maintaining the integrity of book club

289
00:14:44,444 --> 00:14:48,844
,I motion that we kick joey out. Who seconds?

290
00:14:51,945 --> 00:14:53,545
Come on! He didn't read theook.

291
00:14:53,646 --> 00:14:54,646
Neither did I.

292
00:14:54,947 --> 00:14:55,047
Me, neither.

293
00:14:55,148 --> 00:14:56,388
I saw the movie.

294
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,309
There was a movie?!

295
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,050
Did-did anyone here read the book?

296
00:15:02,551 --> 00:15:05,051
You put too muchressure on us, michael. A book a week?

297
00:15:05,252 --> 00:15:07,052
It's just really gotten very stressful.

298
00:15:07,253 --> 00:15:09,253
How is reading stressful?!

299
00:15:09,354 --> 00:15:10,454
Reading is fun! 

300
00:15:11,255 --> 00:15:11,655
It's fun!

301
00:15:12,156 --> 00:15:16,456
OK,Let's not turn to a hostage situation

302
00:15:18,157 --> 00:15:19,457
If you want me to leave, I will.

303
00:15:19,758 --> 00:15:20,758
No!

304
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:24,458
Okay, you know what? I'm-I'm just gonna go.

305
00:15:31,659 --> 00:15:34,859
 okay, it's almost time for the big premiere. I made popcorn.

306
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,160
 Nice place.

307
00:15:37,461 --> 00:15:38,261
Oh. Who's the knockout in the tiara?

308
00:15:38,762 --> 00:15:42,162
  Oh, that's my sister nancy. She was queen of the rose parade.

309
00:15:43,163 --> 00:15:45,763
Hmm. You're cute,  but maybe you shouldn't stand next to her in family pictures

310
00:15:47,564 --> 00:15:49,364
 Yeah, that's what my mom says.

311
00:15:51,765 --> 00:15:55,365
Yeah, I really appreciate you helping me out. I mean, I know I mess with you sometimes, 

312
00:15:55,366 --> 00:15:56,666
but it's just for fun.

313
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:59,136
Oh, yeah. That is fun.

314
00:16:01,868 --> 00:16:04,868
So, this is actually kind of nice. Being friendly.

315
00:16:04,969 --> 00:16:07,369
Maybe we could keep it up a little longer than a week.

316
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,270
 Mm. I physically can'T.

317
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:11,471
 Oh. Oh, my god, it's on!

318
00:16:14,572 --> 00:16:17,072
Oh. Mmm-mmm. Look at george clooney. I would wear him down to a nub.

319
00:16:19,367 --> 00:16:23,167
Yeah, I would... have bunches of sex with him.

320
00:16:24,868 --> 00:16:26,368
Oh, my god, i think that's jessica's husband getting out of the limo!

321
00:16:26,869 --> 00:16:28,869
Oh, my god, this is exciting! Oh, there she is!

322
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,270
 O Oh, wow. 

323
00:16:30,571 --> 00:16:32,271
She actually looks really good.

324
00:16:32,272 --> 00:16:36,472
Uh, uh, not that I'm surprised.I mean, when I said "actually," I didn't mean that...

325
00:16:37,073 --> 00:16:37,573
what?

326
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:39,374
What's wrong?

327
00:16:40,175 --> 00:16:41,075
Sh-she took it down. 

328
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:42,376
 What?! 

329
00:16:43,477 --> 00:16:46,877
That wasn't the style I gave her. Sh-she must have taken it out in the limo.

330
00:16:47,478 --> 00:16:48,578
 Sh... she hated it.

331
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:51,579
I can't believe this.

332
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,180
Oh, I'm so sorry.

333
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,581
  I knew when I walked in there,  I was out of my league, 

334
00:16:57,682 --> 00:16:59,482
but I spent two hours trying to fake it.

335
00:17:01,483 --> 00:17:01,983
Oh, no. 

336
00:17:04,084 --> 00:17:05,284
 Um, there, there.

337
00:17:06,885 --> 00:17:09,005
 I can't believe I ever thought I could do this.

338
00:17:09,506 --> 00:17:12,006
 I just don't fit in with rich people.They look down on me. They always have,and they always will.

339
00:17:12,107 --> 00:17:15,452
With their grammar and their leg-crossing, and...

340
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:19,588
 hey,

341
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:22,309
 don't be saying that, girlfriend.

342
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:29,010
 Okay, look, I grew up with money, and I don't look down on you.

343
00:17:29,511 --> 00:17:31,411
If anything, I envy you.

344
00:17:31,612 --> 00:17:32,412
Oh, come on.

345
00:17:32,513 --> 00:17:33,313
It's true.

346
00:17:33,514 --> 00:17:36,614
    I wish I were as strong and as confident as you.

347
00:17:36,815 --> 00:17:40,015
 And if it were me, I'd be more than happy to have you do my hair. 

348
00:17:41,816 --> 00:17:42,416
Really? 

349
00:17:43,817 --> 00:17:44,217
You mean that?

350
00:17:44,618 --> 00:17:45,618
 Absolutely.

351
00:17:47,419 --> 00:17:48,619
 So, can we do it right now?

352
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,520
 Now?

353
00:17:51,921 --> 00:17:53,351
 Oh, now seems so soon.

354
00:17:58,222 --> 00:18:01,022
Look, michael, it's joey. I know you're mad,

355
00:18:01,103 --> 00:18:05,523
  but I hope you come home soon so we can talk about how you're feeling and work this out.

356
00:18:06,424 --> 00:18:10,024
And also, if you get a chance to pick up some tacos or something on your way home

357
00:18:11,325 --> 00:18:12,125
that would be great.

358
00:18:17,926 --> 00:18:18,426
 hey.

359
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,926
 Look, uh,

360
00:18:21,027 --> 00:18:24,627
I know you're upset because jane liked me, all right?

361
00:18:25,028 --> 00:18:28,028
But I hope you know, I would never come between you and a girl, all right?

362
00:18:28,129 --> 00:18:30,829
 And I really did not mean for that to happen.

363
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,530
 Oh, I know you didn'T.

364
00:18:34,431 --> 00:18:35,331
 That... that's the problem.

365
00:18:38,222 --> 00:18:38,632
  What?

366
00:18:40,433 --> 00:18:43,033
It'S... it's gonna happen whether yotry or not

367
00:18:43,134 --> 00:18:47,534
you know? Any time I actually get a girl and bring her home she'll take one look at you, and she'll forget I'm even here.

368
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,235
Hey, come on, give yourself some credit. 

369
00:18:51,036 --> 00:18:53,536
 Michael, you have so many gifts that I don't have.

370
00:18:54,337 --> 00:18:56,237
You're really smart.

371
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,838
People respect your opinion about stuff. That's a great thing.

372
00:19:01,339 --> 00:19:01,939
Maybe, you know?

373
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,540
I'd still rather have your gifts

374
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,841
Yeah, me, too.

375
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:12,142
Hey, but believe me

376
00:19:12,643 --> 00:19:14,543
you are on your way to big things

377
00:19:15,004 --> 00:19:17,644
Okay, because you're only gonna get better with girls and stuff

378
00:19:18,545 --> 00:19:20,145
but I'll always suck at math.

379
00:19:22,006 --> 00:19:25,406
You know? In, like, five years, you are gonna be a force to be reckoned with. 

380
00:19:27,007 --> 00:19:27,407
Yeah? 

381
00:19:29,508 --> 00:19:31,008
And in five years 

382
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:32,509
you'll be 40.

383
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,910
You got a lot of your mother in you, don't you?

384
00:19:42,311 --> 00:19:49,141
 Okay, ladies and gentlemen, modeling an original gina tribbiani hairstyle called the nice 'n nasty...

385
00:19:51,342 --> 00:19:53,742
I give you alex garrett.

386
00:19:56,103 --> 00:19:57,943
Whoa! Now that's a neighbor. 

387
00:19:59,544 --> 00:20:02,344
come on. Get your camera.I want to get some pictures.

388
00:20:02,545 --> 00:20:05,445
 You look so different. I-I can't believe you own an outfit that slutty.

389
00:20:05,146 --> 00:20:08,246
 Hey, that's mine. I wear that to church.

390
00:20:11,447 --> 00:20:13,247
 You're very nice to be such a good sport.

391
00:20:14,048 --> 00:20:14,648
 Can I tell you something? 

392
00:20:15,349 --> 00:20:16,049
I love it. 

393
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,850
I feel like julia roberts in pretty woman.

394
00:20:21,851 --> 00:20:23,051
 Oh. You know she was a hooker, right?

395
00:20:23,882 --> 00:20:26,552
 Yes. I have to go look at myself in the mirror again.

396
00:20:38,553 --> 00:20:41,653
Joey,I've got a great news

397
00:20:41,754 --> 00:20:43,054
did I get that commerical?

398
00:20:43,155 --> 00:20:45,255
No, I bought a horse.

399
00:20:47,256 --> 00:20:49,156
Joey,come on I gotta get to school

400
00:20:50,057 --> 00:20:51,557
OH,hi,I'm Michael

401
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:56,058
Have a seat

402
00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:00,259
Joey I completely forgot

403
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,160
There's a 重播的支票 in the accounting department

404
00:21:04,361 --> 00:21:06,461
Why don't you go and grab it

405
00:21:07,662 --> 00:21:09,662
All right I'll be right back

406
00:21:19,163 --> 00:21:21,163
So, Michael

407
00:21:22,064 --> 00:21:24,364
How do you feel full frontal nudity

408
00:21:27,265 --> 00:21:28,265
I'm not an actor

409
00:21:29,001 --> 00:21:30,666
Oh,yes,I know
