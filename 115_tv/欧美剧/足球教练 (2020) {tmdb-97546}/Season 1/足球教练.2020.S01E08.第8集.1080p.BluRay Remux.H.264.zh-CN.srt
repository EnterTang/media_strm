1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,700
我叫梅林达·戈登
My name is Melinda Gordon.

2
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,700
刚结婚  刚搬来这个小镇
I just got married, just moved to a small town,

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,700
刚开了间古董店
just opened up an antique shop.

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,900
我也许和你相似
I might be just like you.

5
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,600
但当我还是小姑娘时
Except from the time that I was a little girl,

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,400
我就能同亡者交流
I knew that I could talk to the dead.

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,100
没事的  亲爱的
It's all right, honey.

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,300
祖母称他们为地缚灵
Earthbound spirits, my grandmother called them,

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,000
他们在人间滞留
the ones who have not crossed over

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,000
是因为他们有未了的心愿
because they have unfinished business with the living.

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,800
他们找我帮忙
And they come to me for help.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,100
讲述我的故事  就是讲述他们的故事
To tell you my story, I have to tell you theirs.

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,200
救命
Help me!

14
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,600
谢天谢地你终于回来了
Thank God you're home.

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,900
这电影一个人看太恐怖了
This is not the kind of movie you wanna watch alone.

16
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,600
等等  这电影你看过
Wait. You've seen this before.

17
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,900
怎么还害怕
How is it still scary?

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,800
不知道  就是害怕
I don't know. It just is.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
你还好吧
You okay?

20
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,600
不怎么好
I had a hard day.

21
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,100
但现在没事了
I'm fine now.

22
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,300
能抓着我的手陪我一起看吗
Will you hold my hand and watch this with me?

23
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,400
行  那我先洗个澡
Sure. I should hop in the shower first.

24
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,800
好的  快点
Okay. Hurry up.

25
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,400
你有没有过这种感觉
You ever have one of those days

26
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,900
好几天都怪怪的
where everything just feels weird?

27
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,300
别进去  为什么
Don't go in there. I mean, why?

28
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,500
为什么要那样做
Why do you do that?

29
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,800
就好像
You know, it's like I'm...

30
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,500
好像戴错了眼镜
Like I'm wearing the wrong pair of glasses or something.

31
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,700
怪就怪在我从不戴眼镜
Which is weird since I don't wear glasses.

32
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,900
开灯啊  白痴
Turn the lights on, bimbo!

33
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,900
怎么了
What?

34
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,900
吉姆
Jim?

35
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,800
没事
No, I'm fine.

36
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,900
我昨天修过水管
It's just the plumbing job I did yesterday.

37
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,500
可能铁锈跑进管子了
Must've knocked some rust into the pipes.

38
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,000
我忘记跟你说了  对不起
Oh, I should've told you. I'm sorry.

39
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,000
还洗了脸  真恶心
Washing my face? Gross.

40
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,100
怎么了
What's the matter?

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,800
没事  我去关水阀
Nothing, I'm just gonna lock up.

42
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,300
你看电影  我很快回来
Watch the movie. I'll be right back.

43
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,500
鬼语者  第一季  第8集
白鸽展翅

44
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:27,900
鲍比
Bobby!

45
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,300
是  救出来了
Yeah, I got it.

46
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,400
可能吸入过多烟雾了
It looks like smoke-induced asthma.

47
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,700
昏迷  呼吸微弱
All closed up. Agonal respiration.

48
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,200
氧气罩  支气管舒张剂
Let's get a paediatric mask, start an albuterol treatment.

49
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,700
快点  给我氧气罩
Come on, get that mask.

50
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,500
血压  90/140
BP 140 over 90.

51
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,400
有烧伤吗
Do you see any burns?

52
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,200
血压在降
Blood pressure is dropping.

53
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,100
吉姆  吉姆
Oh, Jim. Hey, Jim.

54
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,300
吉姆  血压还在降  她快不行了
Jim, BP's dropping. We're losing her.

55
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,900
要救活她
We're not losing her.

56
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,600
-快点  伙计  -是  快点
- Come on, man! - Yeah. Come on.

57
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,400
一定要救活她  呼吸
We're not losing her. Breathe.

58
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,900
来吧
Let's go.

59
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,300
好了  呼吸稳定了
Okay. Respiration's stabilising.

60
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,900
-她缓过来了  -带她走吧
- She's coming back. - Take her out.

61
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,800
你确定没事吗
You sure you're okay?

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
没事
I'm all right.

63
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,300
-好  带她离开  -送上车
- Okay, let's take her in. - Just take her up.

64
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,200
你说话了吗
Did you say something?

65
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,500
我  没有  我遇上
Me? No. I ran into...

66
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,600
你是不是告诉我  对不起
Do you tell me... Sorry.

67
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,900
-你说  -不  你说吧
- Go ahead. - No. You.

68
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,800
我告诉你什么
Do I tell you...

69
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,300
每当你看到鬼魂
Do you always tell me,

70
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,300
都会告诉我吗
you know, when you see spirits,

71
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,800
还是有太多鬼魂
or are there so many of them,

72
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,000
你没告诉我
you don't even mention it?

73
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,000
没告诉你
Door number two.

74
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,200
我只是
I just...

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,300
你是怎么应付的
I don't know how you deal with that.

76
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,200
接受他们  继续生活
I just factor it in, move on.

77
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,300
否则我会疯的
I guess I'd go crazy if I didn't.

78
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,300
现在有鬼吗
Is there someone here now?

79
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,000
没有
No.

80
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,000
你确定吗
Are you sure?

81
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,300
吉姆  你怎么了
Jim, what's going on?

82
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,600
你最近总是怪怪的
You've been acting really weird lately.

83
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,100
有什么烦心事吗
Is something bothering you?

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,600
我不知道是不是
Okay. I don't know if it's

85
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,300
因为和你在一起
just being with you, you know,

86
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,000
而受到你的影响
if it's rubbing off on me or something,

87
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,200
最近我总是有一些感觉
but lately I've been having these feelings.

88
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,600
什么感觉
What kind of feelings?

89
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,800
像被监视着
Like I'm being watched.

90
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,500
感觉一来  我就变得
And when it happens, I'm just

91
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,300
焦虑不安
flooded with this sense of anxiety

92
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,100
甚至是绝望
or, I don't know, with despair or something.

93
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,100
我好像处在一种
And it's like I'm in the presence of just...

94
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,200
濒临疯狂的状态
Talk about going crazy.

95
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,900
为什么  发生过什么事吗
Why, has something already happened?

96
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,700
可能只是紧张过度  我没事
You know, it's probably just nerves. I'm fine.

97
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,100
-还要吗  -不用
- Do you want some more? - No.

98
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,400
好的
All right.

99
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,300
他看上去像变了个人
He just seems so different.

100
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,500
怎么说
Different how?

101
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,600
心不在焉  闷闷不乐
Distracted. Moody.

102
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,100
也许是感情淡化了
Maybe the romance is fading.

103
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,700
不是吧
Are you serious?

104
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,100
吉姆那么爱你
Jim is nuts over you.

105
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,400
从冥王星上都能感受到爱意
You can feel the chemistry from, like, Pluto.

106
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,900
那是怎么回事
Then what's wrong?

107
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,700
不好意思  这个
Excuse me, but this...

108
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,000
梅格斯
Migs?

109
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,400
亚历西斯
Alexis.

110
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,800
你在这干什么
What are you doing here?

111
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,400
我住这儿
I live here.

112
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,000
太意外了
Well, this is incredible.

113
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,600
来  抱抱
Come here, hon. Give me a hug.

114
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,200
你来这干什么
So, what are you doing here?

115
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,800
为一家杂志写游记
I'm writing a travel article for a magazine.

116
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,200
你好  我是勒西·福格蒂
Hi. Lexi Fogarty.

117
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,700
你好

118
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,000
我和她以前是死党中的死党
Melinda and I were best friends for, like, ever.

119
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,500
对吧  梅格斯
Right, Migs?

120
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,300
我和安德里亚一起开的店
Andrea co-owns the store with me.

121
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,600
是的  幸会
Yeah. It's nice to meet you.

122
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,800
我
Wow. I...

123
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,900
我好想和你叙叙旧  梅格斯
I have so much I want to say to you, Migs.

124
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,500
我知道过去有些不愉快  但是
I know we left things a little bumpy, but...

125
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,400
一起吃午饭怎么样
Hey, can I take you to lunch?

126
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,800
不行  亚历西斯
Oh, I can't, Alexis.

127
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,500
我很忙
I'm very busy right now.

128
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,900
要不这样
Tell you what.

129
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,100
我这周都在这  联系我
I'll be here all weekend, so give me a call.

130
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,800
这是我的手机号
Here's my cell phone number.

131
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,700
再见
Bye.

132
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,200
怎么回事
Whoa. What was that?

133
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,500
怎么了
What?

134
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,600
你对那个女孩如此冷淡
You just totally iced that girl.

135
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,100
我没有
No, I did not.

136
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,600
梅林达  我都快被你的寒意冻伤了
Melinda, I have like freezer burn over here.

137
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,900
我们以前是死党  现在不是了
Okay, we used to be best friends and we're not any more.

138
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,200
了解
I got that.

139
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,300
怎么回事
What happened?

140
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,200
就是分道扬镳了
We just drifted apart.

141
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,100
你怎么来了
What brings you here?

142
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,500
给你送午饭
Bringing you lunch.

143
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,300
怎么了  支票跳票了
Well, what happened? A cheque bounce?

144
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,100
才怪  给我丈夫送个饭不行吗
No. Just felt like feeding my husband.

145
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,700
顺道看看你怎么样了
And, you know, seeing how you're doing...

146
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,300
我没事  我知道怎么回事了
You know, I'm fine. I think actually, I figured it out.

147
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,100
-是吗  -是的
- You did? - Yeah.

148
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,000
五年前的这周  我爸过世了
My dad died this week, five years ago.

149
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,100
每年此时  我都会感觉有点沮丧
You know, about this time I always start to go into a kind of funk.

150
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,200
只是  今年我把这事忘了
I think the only difference is this year I forgot,

151
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,400
可能为此有点闹心
so, you know, maybe it's just been weighing on me

152
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,600
我甚至都没注意到
and I didn't even notice it.

153
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,700
好吧  你现在好些了吗
Okay, so you're feeling better now?

154
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,900
是的  当然
Yeah, absolutely.

155
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,300
-你确定  -是的
- You sure then? - Yeah.

156
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,300
你多虑了
You worry too much.

157
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,300
这应该担心  我去工作了
I worry just enough. I'm going to work.

158
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,600
好的
All right.

159
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,600
-我爱你  -我也爱你
- Love you. - Love you back.

160
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,700
请注意  标准护理教学录像
Attention. A mandatory training video on standard care

161
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,400
将于11:30上映
will be shown at 11:30.

162
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,000
全员均需按时参加
All personnel are required to attend.

163
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,500
女士  我在找我的马车和车夫
Young lady, I'm looking for my carriage and driver.

164
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,100
-你看到他们了吗  -抱歉  没有
- Have you seen them? - No. Sorry.

165
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,600
天啊  剧院已经关了很久了
Good Lord. The theatre's been out for ages.

166
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,500
我怎么和妻子说去
What will I tell my wife?

167
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,500
我只瞥了他一眼
I only saw him for a second,

168
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,400
就把我吓得要死
but this guy scared the hell out of me.

169
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,800
我可不是胆小的人
And I don't scare that easy.

170
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,800
算了吧  我们一起看《午夜凶铃》
Please. We saw The Ring together.

171
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,300
你还躲在沙发下不敢看呢
You spent the whole movie under your seat.

172
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,200
那是科幻  这是现实
That was fiction. This is real life.

173
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,100
我阅鬼无数  唯独这个让我窒息
I've seen a lot of ghosts. This guy made my blood run cold.

174
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,100
靠近他就像走进了无尽的邪恶
It was like the evils of the universe were just seeping out of him.

175
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,200
你觉得是有鬼魂缠着吉姆不放
And you think one of these things has attached itself to Jim?

176
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,000
是的  他寝食难安
Well, it makes sense. He's moody. He's not eating.

177
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,200
深感绝望
He has these waves of despair.

178
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,100
他以前不是这样的
I mean, nothing like this has ever happened to him.

179
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,900
就算你的假设成立
So, assuming you're right,

180
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,700
你要怎么摆脱此等恶鬼
what do you do to get rid of a malevolent spirit?

181
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,100
不知道  我祖母没教过我
I don't know. My grandmother never walked me through this one.

182
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,000
梅林达  一点也不安慰
Melinda, not comforting.

183
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,600
知道吗  该开门营业了
You know what? It's time to open.

184
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,900
你慢慢画  不用急
You finish up. No hurry.

185
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,600
以下情况下  需施行心肺复苏
Be prepared to provide resuscitation

186
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,300
病人呼吸停止
if the patient stops breathing

187
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,900
或者心脏停跳
or experiences sudden cardiac arrest.

188
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,700
条件允许  可携带自动除颤器
So when available, bring an automated external defibrillator

189
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,300
前往病人所在地
to the patient's location.

190
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,400
作为专业的医护人员  应当具备
A professional medical-care provider should evaluate anyone

191
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,200
评估病人是否患有心脏病的能力
suspected of experiencing a heart problem.

192
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,600
吉姆  救我  儿子
Jim. Help me, Son.

193
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,500
求你了  吉姆
Please, Jim!

194
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,900
求你了
Please!

195
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,400
吉姆  救我  儿子
Jim. Help me, Son.

196
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
求你了  救我
Please. Help.

197
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,600
求你了  吉姆
Please, Jim.

198
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,000
吉姆
Jim?

199
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,000
吉姆
Jim?

200
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,500
在这
In here.

201
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,900
你还好吧
Are you okay?

202
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,200
他们说把你送回家了
They told me you were sent home.

203
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,500
我看到我爸了  梅林达
I saw my dad, Mel.

204
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,400
在枯燥的教学影片里
In this stupid training film.

205
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,300
刚开始不是他  但后来明显是
I mean, it wasn't him at first, but then it was clearly him.

206
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,500
他向我大声呼救  究竟怎么回事
And he's yelling for me to help him. What is going on?

207
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,300
我想我错了
I think I was wrong.

208
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,100
有个灵魂一直缠着你
There is a spirit attached to you and...

209
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,300
-可你谁也没看到啊  -不  现在没有
- But you didn't see one. - Well, no. Not now.

210
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,800
但今早在消防队旁看到一个
But I saw someone at the firehouse this morning

211
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
把我吓坏了
and he really scared me.

212
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,600
他长得什么样
What did he look like?

213
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,500
平头  黑眼睛
Shaved-down hair, dark eyes,

214
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,700
满身的纹身
and completely covered in tattoos.

215
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,800
梅林达  他是在翻车事故中死去的病人
Mel, it's the patient who died when we flipped the rig,

216
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
我们的车爆胎了  记得吗
when we blew the tyre, remember?

217
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,400
想回家谋杀妻子的那个
That guy who was on his way to kill his wife?

218
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,500
他想干什么
What does he want?

219
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,700
难怪他会缠着你
No wonder he attached himself to you.

220
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,500
你是他死前见的最后一个人
You're the last person that he saw as he died.

221
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,600
他要我为他的死负责  要复仇吗
Does he blame me for his death? Does he want revenge?

222
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,200
我不知道
I don't know.

223
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,500
至少我没疯
At least I'm not crazy.

224
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,800
我们会解决的  好吗
We're gonna figure this out, all right?

225
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,100
我会像胶水一样粘着你
And I'm gonna stick to you like glue

226
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,400
等这个鬼魂出现
until I see this ghost again.

227
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,700
伙计们
Hey, Guys.

228
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,900
一切还好吗
Everything okay?

229
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,000
是的  很好
Yeah. Everything's fine.

230
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,300
怎么了
Why?

231
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,700
没什么
No reason.

232
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,500
我只是来修理柜子
You know, I just came to fix the cabinet.

233
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,900
谢了  吉姆  我们快被这逼疯了
Thanks, Jim. 'Cause it's driving us crazy.

234
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,400
天啊  怎么了
God. What happened?

235
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,100
你走得这么匆忙
You ran out of here so fast.

236
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,100
吉姆发生了一点小插曲
Jim had some kind of an episode.

237
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,800
以为他看到死去的父亲了
Thought he saw his dead father.

238
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
吉姆能看到鬼魂
Jim is seeing ghosts?

239
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,700
不  我觉得是那鬼魂
No. No. I just think the spirit, or whatever it is,

240
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,700
在干扰他的思想
is messing with his head.

241
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,300
太恐怖了
Creepy.

242
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,600
你准备怎么做
What are you gonna do?

243
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,500
除了等  别无他法
There's nothing I can do except wait until I see the ghost.

244
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,200
所以才带他来
You know, that's why he's here.

245
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,400
没什么
Nothing.

246
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,100
要不我们走吧  我不想吓着你
Do you want us to go? 'Cause I don't wanna freak you out.

247
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,700
不  没关系
No. Of course not.

248
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,900
在你俩身边  有一两个恶鬼算什么
What's a malevolent spirit or two between friends, right?

249
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,000
那是从哪来的
Where did those come from?

250
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,400
很漂亮吧  勒西带回来的
Aren't they pretty? Lexi brought them by.

251
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,800
她真的很想跟你和好
She is really trying to reach out to you.

252
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,600
我不知道你们为什么会闹翻
I mean, I don't know why you guys drifted apart, but...

253
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,300
好吧  我说谎了  我们没有闹翻
Okay, I lied. We didn't drift.

254
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,400
更像是玉石俱焚
It was more like crash and burn.

255
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,300
能谈谈吗
You wanna talk about it?

256
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,900
大一那年
Freshman year college.

257
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,700
勒西把我的能力告诉了别人
Lexi, she started telling people about my abilities.

258
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,800
在我知道之前
And before I knew it,

259
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,200
我早就成了一个笑柄
I had become some kind of laughingstock.

260
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,900
我忿然离开了学校
It got so uncomfortable, I finally left school.

261
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,100
梅林达
Melinda.

262
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,900
可笑的是  我心底还希望跟她
You know, the funny thing is, there's a part of me that wishes

263
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,500
是朋友
Alexis and I were still friends.

264
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,600
不  你开玩笑吧
No! Are you kidding me?

265
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,900
你不要再搭理她了
You can never, ever speak to her again.

266
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,700
永远都不要
Never, ever.

267
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,100
-有发现吗  -没有
- Anything?  - No.

268
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,700
缠身不是应该缠着不放的吗
I thought attached meant attached.

269
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,300
来了又走算什么
Why do they come and go?

270
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,100
他们侵蚀我们的精力和感情
They feed off our energy, off our emotions.

271
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,600
就像给他们充电一样
It's like recharging their batteries, you know?

272
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,800
然后就能四处游荡
And then they're free to wander off for a while.

273
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,300
那他们会游荡回来吗
Well, do they ever wander off and never come back?

274
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,100
我不清楚
Not that I know of.

275
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,600
就知道你会这么说
I thought you were gonna say that.

276
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,400
你冻坏了 抱歉
You're chilly. I'm sorry.

277
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,800
我去开电热器
I'll turn on the space heater.

278
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
好的
Yeah.

279
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,100
保险丝烧断了
I blew a fuse.

280
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,000
是吗  那就回床上吧
Really? Well, why don't you come back to bed

281
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,300
明天再修吧
and we'll fix it tomorrow?

282
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,700
为什么  亲爱的
Why, honey?

283
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,900
你害黑吗
You're afraid, are you now?

284
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,800
不  不是
No, I'm not scared.

285
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,300
但我要和你一起去
I'm gonna come with you, though.

286
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,800
只是烧了保险丝  电路超负荷了
I just blew a fuse, you know. I overloaded the circuit.

287
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,100
我马上就回来
I'll be right back.

288
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,500
蜡烛要吗
Candle?

289
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,000
你留着吧
You keep it.

290
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,000
你到了吗
Are you there now?

291
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,100
还没  我还在摸着去地下室
Not yet. I'm just feeling my way down to the basement.

292
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,500
帮个忙  能把电热器关掉吗
You wanna do me a favour? Can you unplug the space heater?

293
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,000
好的
Okay.

294
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,700
我能看到你
I can see you.

295
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,700
你吓不倒我的
And you don't scare me. You don't.

296
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,000
你是谁  你对我丈夫有何企图
Who are you? And what do you want with my husband?

297
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,600
我找的不是你丈夫
It's not your husband I want.

298
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,900
是你
It's you.

299
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
我
Me?

300
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,700
你找我干什么
What do you want with me?

301
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,100
我需要帮助
I need help.

302
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,500
你能看见我们
You see us.

303
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,300
所有亡灵
All the lost souls.

304
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,600
我从你身上感受到一股邪气
I feel very dark things coming from you.

305
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,800
如果不了解情况  我无法帮你
I can't help you if I don't understand what I'm feeling.

306
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,100
我杀了个人
I killed a man.

307
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,000
你叫什么名字
What's your name?

308
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,800
朱利安·博基亚
Julian Borgia.

309
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,700
我不会装好人
I don't pretend to be a good man.

310
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,200
你杀了什么人
Who did you kill?

311
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,500
一个无辜者
Someone innocent.

312
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,300
我们刚抢劫完
We had just pulled a robbery

313
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,400
正准备逃跑
and we were trying to get away.

314
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,800
快滚出车子
Get out of the car!

315
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,500
好的  好的
Okay. All right.

316
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,900
我不是有意的
I didn't mean for it to happen.

317
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,800
很多事  我并非有意为之
There are a lot of things I never meant to do.

318
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,500
快走
Go! Come on!

319
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,000
我的同伙被捕了  但我没有
My partners were arrested, but I ran.

320
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,500
我知道我妻子搬走了
I knew my wife had moved away,

321
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,300
但我还是找到了她
but I managed to find her.

322
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,900
我见到了我的孩子  约瑟
I saw my child, Joseph.

323
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,800
一个陌生的儿子
The son that I never knew.

324
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,800
我以为一家三口可以重新开始
And I thought maybe that the three of us could start over.

325
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,800
但瑞秋早已不再爱我
But l'd lost Rachel's love a long time ago.

326
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,100
她不想让我见孩子
She didn't want my son exposed to me.

327
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,600
当晚  警察来抓我
I shouldn't have been surprised

328
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,900
我就知道是她告的密
when the police showed up at the house that night.

329
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,700
入狱之后  我开始看清真相
In prison, I started to see the truth.

330
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,100
我挥霍了青春
I had wasted my life.

331
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,000
伤及无辜
I hurt innocent people.

332
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,300
伤害爱我的人
And people who loved me.

333
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,700
我发誓出狱后
And I made a promise that when I got out,

334
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,200
一定要洗心革面
that I would start over clean.

335
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,600
出狱当天
The day I was released,

336
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,000
有人让我出去后帮他做点事
I was asked to do a job on the outside.

337
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,600
我拒绝了
I refused.

338
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,000
我脑海中只有一件事
My mind was on only one thing.

339
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,900
寻求宽恕并重新开始
To find forgiveness and to begin again.

340
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,900
我真的以为
I truly believed that I could do this,

341
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,100
可以改邪归正
that I could make amends.

342
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,100
然而我错了
I was wrong.

343
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,000
帮帮忙  我们这边需要帮手
Give us a hand. We need help in the back here.

344
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,000
我以为你缠着我丈夫
I think that you're haunting my husband

345
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,600
是因为他是你最后见到的人
because he was the last person you saw before you died.

346
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,700
不  是因为你
No. It's because of you.

347
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,000
你想再见见你的妻儿吗  
Is it your wife and son? Do you wanna see them again?

348
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,900
不  瑞秋根本不知道我死了
No. Rachel doesn't even know I'm dead.

349
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,600
那我怎么帮你
Then how can I help you?

350
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,700
我死的那天
The day that I died,

351
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,000
正准备去找我错杀的那人的家人
I was going to find the family of the man that I killed

352
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,300
乞求他们的原谅
and I was gonna beg for forgiveness.

353
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,200
我现在只想完成这个心愿
I wanna see that through now.

354
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,900
和你一起
With you.

355
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,600
你愿意帮我吗
Will you help me?

356
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,000
我不知道该不该相信你
I don't know if I can trust you.

357
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,500
我听说你想伤害你妻子
I've heard that you wanted to hurt your wife.

358
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,100
不
No!

359
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,000
我没有
I never...

360
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,400
绝对没有
I never...

361
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,800
说这话的人骗了你
Whoever told you that, lied.

362
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,000
我爱我妻子  我从没想过要伤害她
I loved my wife. I never wanted to harm her.

363
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,400
我只要  求你相信我了
I just need... Would you please just believe me?

364
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,200
你是我最后的希望了
You're my only hope, man.

365
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,100
亲爱的  可以开电热器了
Honey, go ahead and plug in the space heater.

366
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,700
我修好电路了
I got to rewire some of the circuits...

367
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,100
他在这里
Is he here?

368
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,300
告诉我  他想怎样
Tell me what he wants.

369
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,600
不  告诉我你想干嘛
No, no. Tell me what you want!

370
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,000
对不起
I'm sorry.

371
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,400
这可不是个善良的灵魂
This is not a benign spirit, okay?

372
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,200
以我的感受来看  绝不是
Not after the stuff I've been feeling.

373
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,500
也许用善良形容不恰当
Okay, so maybe 'benign' was a bad word,

374
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,800
但他明显非常悲伤
but the man is obviously deeply unhappy,

375
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,500
被人误解  苟且偷生
tortured and has had a horrible life.

376
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,850
但不代表
That does not mean that

377
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,000
他心中不存丝毫善念
there's not some spark of good in him.

378
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,500
亲爱的  我知道你想相信
Honey, I know you wanna believe that, but this guy...

379
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,900
但他要我们横跨半个州
This guy wants us to drive halfway across the state

380
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,500
去找被他错杀的人的父母
and help him find the parents of the man he killed?

381
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,700
是的  我们要帮他实现
Yeah, and that's exactly what we're gonna do.

382
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,000
你觉得这样能有什么结果
How well do you think that is gonna go over, okay?

383
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,300
你告诉他们
When you tell them

384
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,400
你代表凶手而来吗
you represent the man who killed their son?

385
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,400
我知道这不简单
Well, I don't think it's gonna go over very well at all.

386
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,700
但不能为此而拒绝帮助他
But that is not a reason not to help him.

387
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,400
知道吗  你顽固得就像
You know what? You are... You are as stubborn as a...

388
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,600
我
Me.

389
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,900
我只是不想那鬼魂再缠着我
I just don't want this guy attached to me any more

390
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,600
或逗留在家里
or in my house.

391
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,500
对不起  你说得对
I'm sorry. You're right.

392
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,400
你别无选择
You don't have another choice.

393
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,100
等等我
Hey. Wait up.

394
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,600
你也喜欢晨跑
So you're an early-morning jogger, too?

395
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,900
是的
Uh, yeah.

396
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,000
我很喜欢这个时间段
I just love this time of day.

397
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,500
我和梅格斯在高中时就常一起晨跑
When Migs and I were in high school, we used to do this...

398
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,500
我还是想一个人晨跑
You know, I really prefer to run by myself.

399
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,800
谢谢
Thanks.

400
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,100
好吧
Okay, then.

401
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,300
听着
Look,

402
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,200
我也不想对你刻薄
I'm not trying to be a bitch.

403
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,200
我只是觉得
I guess I'm just one of those people

404
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,700
忠诚是优秀品质
who thinks that loyalty is a personal asset.

405
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,200
肯定因为化妆舞会的事
Oh, this is about that costume party.

406
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,100
天啊  我希望她能走出那个阴影
God, I wish she'd get over that.

407
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,900
我不知道什么化妆舞会
I don't know anything about a costume party.

408
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,500
那只是个玩笑
It was a joke.

409
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,000
几个孩子想办一场化妆舞会
Some kids decided to throw this costume party,

410
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,800
每人都要打扮成自己梦想中的样子
and everyone was supposed to come as their favourite fantasy.

411
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,300
至少她们是这么和梅林达说的
At least that's what they told Melinda.

412
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,900
这么说  你令她在朋友面前当众出丑
So you humiliated her in front of her friends.

413
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,800
我
I...

414
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,000
我高中时一直替她保密
I kept her secret all through high school.

415
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,900
她朋友里只有我参加了她祖母的葬礼
I was practically her only friend at her grandmother's funeral.

416
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,100
我倾听她所有的困扰
I've listened to all of her problems,

417
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,700
-一向如此  -亚历西斯
- all the time. - Alexis,

418
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,200
朋友本该如此
that's just what friends do.

419
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,200
真是遗憾
What a shame.

420
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,000
我们第一次有机会远行  却是为了这事
Our first chance to get away, look what we're doing.

421
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,100
这又不是什么私奔
It's not exactly a romantic getaway, huh?

422
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,300
他在车里吗
Is he here?

423
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,400
是的  他好像很入神
Yes. He seems very preoccupied.

424
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,000
朱利安
Julian.

425
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,400
我想向你道歉
Look, I just wanted to say I was sorry

426
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,800
事故当晚  没能把你抢救回来
for the way things went down on the night of the accident.

427
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,700
我当时已经死了  我并不怪他
I was already dead. I don't blame him.

428
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,000
他说他不怪你
He says he doesn't blame you.

429
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,900
谢谢  朱利安
Thanks, Julian.

430
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,600
现在  事实对我来说很明了
The truth is clear to me now.

431
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,100
这些都注定要发生
This was all meant to happen

432
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,000
我才能认识你
Because it led me to you.

433
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,000
帮我赎罪
And so to my salvation.

434
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,500
他说不客气
He says you're welcome.

435
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,900
请问是法雷尔夫人吗
Uh, Mrs. Farrell?

436
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,700
-是  -你好
- Yes? - Hi.

437
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,300
我叫梅林达·戈登  这是我丈夫吉姆
My name is Melinda Gordon. This is my husband Jim.

438
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,700
你不认识我们
You don't know us,

439
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,600
但我们最近认识了
But we've recently become acquainted with...

440
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,500
某个认识您儿子的人
With someone who was familiar with your son.

441
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,200
不好意思
Oh, I'm sorry.

442
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,700
你刚才说你是谁
Who did you say you were?

443
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,600
梅林达·戈登
Melinda Gordon. I...

444
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,800
我
I...

445
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,600
我的妻子有一种天赋
My wife has a gift.

446
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:43,300
这很难解释
And this is going to be kind of hard to explain,

447
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,300
但是她能够
But she has the ability

448
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,300
看见并和亡者交谈
to talk to and see people who have died.

449
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,300
-她可以帮助他们  -稍等
- She can help them... - Wait a minute.

450
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,700
你是说
Are you telling me

451
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,300
你和我儿子有联系吗
that you've been in contact with my son?

452
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,300
其实  没有
Actually, no.

453
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,600
我和杀害他的人联系上了
I've been in contact with the man who killed him.

454
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,100
天呐
Oh, my God.

455
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,400
他并非故意伤害你儿子
He never meant to hurt your son.

456
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,400
是一场意外  我从来不杀人
It was an accident. I would never take a life.

457
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,300
他说是一场意外  还有他从不
He said that it was an accident and that he would never...

458
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,800
算了
It doesn't matter.

459
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,500
我知道我是罪人
I know I'm guilty.

460
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,800
因为我给他们带来这么多痛苦
You see, because I'm the cause for their pain.

461
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,700
他出狱后  就想来这里
He was on his way to beg you for your forgiveness

462
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,000
乞求你们原谅他
when he was released.

463
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,600
他出狱了吗
He was let out?

464
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,900
-怎么没通知我们  -我不知道
- Why didn't they tell us? - I don't know.

465
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,700
但他改变了想法
But he changed his thinking,

466
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,500
以及过去的生活方式
everything about the way he lived.

467
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,500
他想开始新的生活
He wanted to start his life over,

468
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,500
但事情未能如他所愿
but it didn't work out that way.

469
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,700
-为什么  -他被杀了
- Why not? - He was killed.

470
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,800
就在他前来祈求你们谅解那晚
The night he came to ask you to forgive him.

471
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,900
别告诉他们我的麻烦
Don't tell them about my troubles.

472
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,700
告诉他们  我会尽我所能
You tell them that I would give anything,

473
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,600
把他们的儿子带回来
anything to bring back their son.

474
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,800
-你还好吗  -没事
- You okay? - Yeah.

475
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,300
我没事  继续  跟他们讲
I'm fine. Go on. Tell them.

476
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,500
他希望能把你们的儿子带回来
He wishes that he could bring back your son.

477
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,900
够了
That's enough.

478
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,600
-我有一个问题  -请说
- I have one question. - Yes.

479
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,200
为什么我们要听他说话
Why do we have to listen to him?

480
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,100
为什么我们不能和儿子说话
Why can't we talk to our son?

481
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,100
很有可能  你们的儿子毫无牵挂地走了
Well, most likely, your son passed over easily

482
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,400
没有未了的心愿
without issues to keep him earthbound.

483
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,200
而朱利安
Julian, on the other hand,

484
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,300
则为自己的作为饱受煎熬
is tortured by the memory of what he did.

485
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,300
很好
Good.

486
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,000
什么
I'm sorry?

487
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,500
我很高兴他饱受煎熬
I'm glad he was tortured.

488
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,500
他知不知道
Does he have any idea

489
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,800
我们曾多少次希望
how many times we wished we were dead

490
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,100
以死来终止伤痛吗
just to stop the pain?

491
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,800
我们的儿子是个好孩子  
He was a good boy, our son.

492
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,700
他关心  帮助别人
He cared. He wanted to help people.

493
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,350
他正准备大展宏图
He was going to build things.

494
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,800
出人头地
He was going to make a difference.

495
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,500
而那个凶手却无情杀了他
And that's who that murderer took out of the world.

496
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,800
他说枪杀是个意外  我相信他
I believe him when he said that the shooting was an accident.

497
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,900
他的枪上膛了  瞄准了
He had a loaded gun, he pointed it,

498
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,800
子弹脱膛  杀死了我们的儿子
it went off and killed our son.

499
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,600
这算什么意外
What kind of an accident is that?

500
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:05,200
他还想要宽恕
And he wants forgiveness?

501
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,500
要我们宽恕
From us?

502
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,800
休想
Never.

503
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,600
-你还好吗  -没事
- Are you okay? - Yeah.

504
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,500
头痛怎么样了
How's your headache?

505
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,800
好些了
Better.

506
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,000
太可怕了
That was horrible.

507
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,500
我提醒过你
I warned you.

508
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,300
我真替法雷尔一家难过
I just feel so badly for the Farrells.

509
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,800
无法想象他们是怎么走过来的
I can't imagine what they went through.

510
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,400
你以为呢
Well, what did you expect?

511
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,600
他们唯一的儿子被杀了
Their only son was killed.

512
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,900
抱歉
I'm sorry.

513
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,800
抱歉  我不知道我在说什么
I'm sorry. I don't know what I'm saying.

514
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,600
我不清楚我是谁  他在吗
I don't know who I am. Is he here?

515
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,800
不在
No.

516
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,100
我好像被他传染了似的
I mean, it's like I'm infected with him or something.

517
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,700
为什么他仍要这样对我
Why is he still doing this to me?

518
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,300
因为他的能量很强大
Because his energy is really powerful.

519
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
但我并不认为朱利安是坏人  吉姆
But I don't think that Julian is an evil man, Jim.

520
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,100
至少不再是坏人了
At least not any more.

521
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,300
真希望法雷尔一家能听他忏悔
I just wish the Farrells could have heard him speak.

522
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,000
即使那样也无济于事
It wouldn't have made any difference.

523
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,500
我知道你看见我了
I know you see me.

524
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,800
你好  亚历西斯
Hello, Alexis.

525
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,900
你不喜欢我  对吧
You don't like me, do you?

526
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,100
-有关系吗  -你是对的
- Does it matter? - Look, you were right.

527
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,900
我不该跟别人透露梅林达的天赋
I shouldn't have told anyone about Melinda's gift.

528
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,600
那是大学的第一年
It was my first year at college.

529
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,200
我拼命想要融入圈子
I was desperately trying to fit in and...

530
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,400
你应该明白
You know how it is.

531
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,000
好吧  可能你不明白
Okay, maybe you don't know how it is,

532
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,500
但对我而言就是如此
but that's how it was to me.

533
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,200
我想说的是
What I'm trying to say is

534
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,750
你能不能帮我制造一个机会
I wonder if you could set up a meeting

535
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,200
让我和梅林达见一面
between me and Melinda.

536
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,500
我知道有时宽恕难求
I know it's not easy to forgive sometimes.

537
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,500
能否试着和她谈谈
Maybe just try to talk to her?

538
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,200
要点什么
What can I get you?

539
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,300
我要金枪鱼三文治  你要点什么
I'll have the tuna sandwich. What do you wanna order?

540
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,400
吉姆
Jim?

541
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,900
吉姆
Jim.

542
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,500
我不饿
I'm not hungry.

543
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,600
但也得吃啊
Well, you have to eat.

544
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,000
我不饿
I am not hungry.

545
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,600
-你感觉怎么样  -没关系
- Tell me what you're feeling. - It doesn't matter.

546
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,600
有关系  我可以帮你
It does matter. I can help you.

547
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,500
我觉得非常
I feel totally,

548
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,900
极其的孤单
completely alone.

549
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,900
这与我和谁在一起无关
It doesn't matter who I'm with.

550
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,900
我觉得我会一直这样
And I feel like it will always be like this.

551
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:49,800
这不是你的感受  你知道  是他的
Those are not your feelings, you know that. They're his.

552
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,200
太强烈了
They're strong.

553
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,300
我爱你
I love you

554
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,300
非常爱你
so much.

555
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,900
你知道吗
You know that?

556
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,400
你只需记住这点
Well, then, just focus on that.

557
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,400
和朱利安保持安全距离
Keep Julian at a safe distance.

558
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,450
他对法雷尔一家的拒绝
He just feels hopeless,

559
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,300
感到无望
you know, 'cause the Farrells denied him.

560
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,600
他觉得孤单是因为
And he feels lonely because...

561
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,800
我们要去找他的妻儿
We have to find his wife and son.

562
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,100
-不  不行  -不行
- No. We can't.  - We can't.

563
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,500
我对他们不抱希望
Beyond hope with them.

564
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,000
并非没有希望
It is not beyond hope with them.

565
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,200
或许他的妻子得知他的死讯后
Maybe if his wife knows that he's dead,

566
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,300
会改变心意
you know, she'll have a change of heart.

567
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,600
我妻子恨我  我不怪她
My wife hates me and I don't blame her.

568
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,000
我曾无数次地背叛过我妻子
I betrayed her in every way that a husband can betray a wife.

569
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,900
那你的儿子呢
What about your son?

570
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,200
我无时无刻都想他
I think about my son all the time.

571
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,100
可我甚至没试着去了解他
Do you know, I didn't even try to know him.

572
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,300
难道不值得去祈求宽恕吗
Isn't it worth a try at forgiveness?

573
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,400
我已失去我的儿子
I lost my son.

574
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:08,400
我根本无权向他祈求任何东西
And I don't have the right to expect anything from him, okay?

575
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,600
朱利安
Julian.

576
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:17,000
你要相信我  仍有希望
You have to trust me when I say that there is hope.

577
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,300
我帮许多灵魂度过难关
I've been through it with others.

578
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:25,300
我知道失去爱人  对生者的影响
I've seen how the loss of a loved one can affect the survivors.

579
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,500
但我不管你说什么
But I don't care what you say.

580
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,400
并不是没有希望
It is not beyond hope.

581
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,900
朱利安  这是你的机会
Julian, this is your chance, huh?

582
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,500
你要抓住
You got to take it.

583
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,000
朱利安  拜托
Julian, come on.

584
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,000
好吧
Okay.

585
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:16,100
不管事态发展如何
Hey. However this goes down,

586
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,800
我要你知道  我尊重你的做法
I just wanted you to know that I respect what you do.

587
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,700
这种使命感以及
I mean, this calling and...

588
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,400
-吉姆  -不是  我
- Jim... - No, I...

589
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,400
如果情况依然不顺
And so if this doesn't go well...

590
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,500
会顺利的
Hey. It's gonna go well.

591
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,600
你会没事的
You're gonna be okay.

592
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,700
在那儿
There.

593
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,400
瑞秋
Rachel.

594
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,100
打扰一下
Excuse me.

595
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,400
瑞秋  你好
Rachel, hi.

596
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,400
我叫梅林达·戈登  这是我丈夫吉姆
My name is Melinda Gordon. This is my husband Jim.

597
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,000
我们能和你谈一谈吗
Can we talk to you for a few minutes?

598
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,600
你怎么知道我的名字
How do you know my name?

599
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,000
你丈夫  朱利安告诉我的
Through your husband, Julian.

600
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,900
那杀千刀的又犯了什么事
What has that son of a bitch done now?

601
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,300
他什么也没做  他
Oh, he hasn't done anything. He...

602
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,400
死了
Except die.

603
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,700
我知道这是迟早的事
I knew it would happen sooner or later.

604
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,100
只是早了点
I guess it's sooner.

605
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,700
我都说了这是馊主意
Hey, I told you this was a bad idea.

606
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,000
他留了些遗言给你
He has some last words to share with you.

607
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,400
他死的时候  你在他身边
You were with him when he died?

608
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,200
不  我丈夫在
No, but my husband was.

609
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,300
事情要复杂的多  我们可以
It's more complicated than that. Can we...

610
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,500
进去说吗
Can we please come in?

611
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,700
约瑟  我的儿子
Joseph? My son.

612
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,000
都
All...

613
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,600
都长大了
All grown up.

614
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,700
就一会儿
Just for a minute.

615
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,100
好吧  到此为止
Okay, okay, back up here.

616
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,800
你是说  你和朱利安对过话
You're telling me you're talking with Julian?

617
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,600
和他的魂魄对话吗
Like his dead ghost or something?

618
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,700
是的
Yes.

619
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,800
连我都能感觉到他的存在
Even I feel his presence.

620
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,600
你能感觉到他的存在
Oh, you feel his presence, yeah?

621
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,700
我敢说  你还有过很多不眠之夜吧
Bet you've had a few sleepless nights.

622
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,000
我很久以前就离开朱利安了
Look, I left Julian behind a long time ago.

623
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,200
我有生活  有工作  独自抚养儿子
I got a life, I got a job, I raised my son.

624
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,600
我知道她能感觉到我
She can feel me. I can tell.

625
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,400
朱利安说  你能感觉到他
Julian says that you can feel him.

626
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,600
我不相信鬼魂一说
I don't believe in that spirit stuff.

627
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,000
你相信
You did.

628
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,500
我们去科尼岛上找那位占卜师时
When we went to see that fortuneteller on Coney Island.

629
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,500
他说我们注定会结婚
You know, the one who told us that we were gonna get married?

630
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,200
记得科尼岛的占卜师吗
What about the fortuneteller at Coney Island?

631
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,800
谁告诉你的
Who told you about that?

632
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,400
朱利安正和我说呢
Julian's telling me about it.

633
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,700
他说  那是他记忆中最美好的一天
Said it's the best day he can remember.

634
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,100
你那天是那么得美
You were so beautiful that day.

635
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,000
记得吗
Remember?

636
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,500
别说了
Stop it.

637
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,200
你穿着背心裙和凉鞋
In your sundress and sandals.

638
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,200
凉鞋坏了  他不得不背着你
Did a sandal break? Did he have to carry you?

639
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,500
住口
Stop it!

640
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,500
你怎么知道的  这不可能
How do you know about that? You can't!

641
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,700
你不可能知道
You can't know that!

642
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,000
告诉她  我爱她
You tell her that I love her.

643
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,600
他爱你
He loves you.

644
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,500
告诉她一切
Tell her everything.

645
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,200
他很抱歉伤害了你
And he's sorry for the pain he caused.

646
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,200
告诉她  我死有余辜
Tell her that I deserved to die.

647
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,000
我说不出口
I can't say that.

648
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,500
说什么
Say what?

649
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,200
告诉我
Tell me.

650
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,200
他说  他伤害了你  死有余辜
He said that he deserved to die for hurting you.

651
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,400
他再也不会伤害任何人了
And he can't hurt anyone any more.

652
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,500
告诉她  我原谅她
And tell her that I forgive her

653
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,600
向警察告发我
for turning me in to the police.

654
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,300
告诉她  她做得对
Tell her that she did the right thing.

655
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,300
他说  你向警察告发他
He says you did the right thing,

656
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,600
是对的
turning him in to the police.

657
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,600
我没有告发他
I didn't turn him in.

658
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,100
这就是你们的目的吗  你们想让我
Is that what this is about? Are you trying to get me

659
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,300
承认我检举了我丈夫吗
to admit that I blew the whistle on my husband?

660
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,800
不  朱利安以为
No. No. Julian thought...

661
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,300
我才不管他怎么想
I don't care what he thought!

662
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,400
我告诉你
I'm telling you,

663
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,200
我没有告发朱利安
I didn't turn Julian in.

664
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,900
是我
I did.

665
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,200
约瑟  是你报警来抓你爸爸的
Joseph, you called the police on your father?

666
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,800
为什么
Why?

667
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,300
因为我不想让你为他难过
Because I didn't want him making you miserable.

668
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,400
我看不下去了  但我不知道他会死
I couldn't stand to watch any more, but I didn't know he'd die.

669
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,000
我只想让他离开一阵子
I just wanted him to go away for a while.

670
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,900
-约瑟  -别碰我
- Joseph... - Don't touch me!

671
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,700
他会死  全是我的错
Because of me he's dead.

672
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,000
这是怎么了
What's happening?

673
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,400
朱利安在笑
Julian's laughing.

674
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,900
为什么
Why?

675
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,700
因为告发我的人  是我儿子
Because it was my son who turned me in.

676
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,200
不是你  瑞秋  是我的儿子
Not you, Rachel. My son.

677
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,400
为了保护他妈妈
Protecting his mother.

678
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,600
他很高兴
He's happy

679
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,200
你为了保护你妈妈
that you were protecting your mother.

680
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,600
他在告诉你  你做得对
He's telling you you did the right thing.

681
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,900
知道吗  这让我想拥抱他
You know what? That makes me wanna hug him.

682
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,300
你撒谎
You're lying!

683
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,700
-不  我没有  -你能看见他吗
- No, I'm not. - You see him?

684
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,800
是的
Yes.

685
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,400
那他右耳背后有什么
Then what's behind his right ear?

686
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,800
-什么  -在他右耳后面
- What? - Behind his right ear!

687
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,400
他说为了我的出生而纹上的
He put a tattoo there that he said was for me when I was born.

688
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,000
是什么
What is it?

689
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,000
是一只白鸽
It's a white dove.

690
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,200
展翅翱翔
Wings outstretched.

691
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,600
他还说了什么
What else does he say?

692
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:37,800
他想让你成为  他希望成为的人
He wants you to become the man he was trying to be.

693
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,000
学会宽恕他人
To learn forgiveness.

694
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,000
他说记仇
He says that being unforgiving...

695
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,000
就像喝毒药
Is like drinking poison.

696
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,100
就像自己喝毒药
...is like drinking poison

697
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,900
还期望别人去死
and waiting for the other person to die.

698
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,500
问问瑞秋有没有收到我的信
Ask Rachel if she got my letters.

699
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,400
他想问关于信的事
He's asking about some letters.

700
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,000
我没有看过
I didn't open them.

701
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,900
我当时很生他的气
I was mad at him.

702
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,200
你还留着吗
Do you still have them?

703
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,100
他想让你们都看看
He wants you both to read them.

704
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,000
他说能帮助你们理解
He said it'll help you understand.

705
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,000
看看他们
Look at them.

706
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,400
我漂亮的妻儿
My beautiful wife and son.

707
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,900
我曾经一度拥有
I had it all, you know?

708
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,200
我却离弃了他们
And I just threw it away.

709
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,900
他很抱歉  他抛弃了你们的爱
He's sorry that he threw your love away.

710
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,100
他没有抛弃
He didn't throw it away.

711
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,300
朱利安
Julian!

712
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,900
就算你试过
Even though you tried.

713
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,200
天知道  你入狱时  我也试过
God knows, when you went to jail, I tried.

714
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:44,100
但是  该死的  我一直爱你
But, damn it, I always loved you.

715
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,100
他现在需要超度
He needs to cross over now.

716
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,000
但他必须取得你们的原谅才能走
But he can't do that until he knows that you forgive him.

717
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,300
我们原谅了
We do.

718
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,000
我们原谅他了
We do forgive him.

719
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,800
告诉他
And tell him

720
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,400
我也爱他
that I love him, too.

721
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,200
真希望我能为他做点什么
I wish there was something I could do.

722
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,600
告诉他  可以做一件事

723
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,800
去找我错杀的人的父母
Go to the parents of the man that I killed,

724
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,800
想方设法去帮助他们
find a way to befriend them.

725
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,700
但别告诉他们你是谁
But don't tell them who you are.

726
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,300
为他们做些好事
Do good things for them.

727
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,900
让他们的生活更轻松些
Make their lives easier.

728
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,600
不要像我
Make a difference.

729
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,500
我会告诉他的
I'll tell him.

730
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,900
吉姆
Jim?

731
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,800
他走了吗
Is he gone?

732
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,800
真高兴安德里亚能说服你和我共进午餐
I am so glad Andrea talked you into having this lunch with me.

733
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,200
其实  安德里亚让我别来
Actually, Andrea told me not to come.

734
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,500
什么
What?

735
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:48,300
但这个周末非常特别
But it's been an extraordinary weekend and...

736
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,700
我一直在思考如何宽恕他人
I've just been doing a lot of thinking about forgiveness

737
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,900
互相帮助
and what people do to each other.

738
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,700
梅格斯  你真是太好了
That is so cool of you, Migs.

739
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,700
现在应该可以谈谈
So then, now, I guess, would be a good time

740
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,400
大一那年发生的事情了
for us to talk about what happened freshman year.

741
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,000
梅格斯
Migs, look...

742
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,500
我想说
The thing...

743
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,500
我想说的是  别耿耿于怀了
My thing is, don't dwell, you know?

744
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,800
耿耿于怀
Dwell?

745
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,200
不管过去发生过什么
No matter what happened back then,

746
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:24,800
我完全相信你的能力
I totally, totally believe in what you can do.

747
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,900
其实  这也是我来的目的
In fact, it's why I'm here.

748
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,500
什么
What?

749
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,200
你还记得我的露丝阿姨吗
Do you remember my aunt Ruth?

750
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,900
很讨人厌  口臭
Kind of a pain in the butt, bad breath.

751
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,300
她就住在美景镇旁
She lived outside Grandview.

752
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,300
她去年夏天病了
She got sick last summer.

753
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,200
我陪她熬了好几周
I put in some long, hard weekends

754
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,800
直到她去世
with that woman toward the end,

755
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,800
她才答应
and she totally promised me

756
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,600
把那条翡翠项链留给我
she was leaving me this emerald necklace.

757
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,600
真翡翠啊  梅林达
Like real emerald, Melinda,

758
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,900
周围还镶着一圈钻石呢
with diamonds all around it and everything.

759
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,200
总之  她死了
Anyway, she died.

760
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:54,900
你猜怎么着  找不到项链
And guess what? No necklace.

761
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,000
我翻遍了整栋房子
I combed the entire house.

762
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,000
我见到你  我就想
So when I saw you, I thought...

763
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,500
怎么了
What?

764
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,900
我突然感觉好多了
I suddenly feel much better.

765
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,800
好极了
Oh. Good.

766
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,100
很好  我也是
Good. You know, me, too.

767
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,150
因为我发现
Yeah, because I realise that

768
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:12,000
跟你每天对自己的作为相比
what you did to me is nothing

769
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,200
你对我做的不算什么
compared to what you do to yourself every day.

770
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,700
这让我看清了某些东西
And it gives me some perspective, you know?

771
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:22,800
时光飞逝啊
Wow. Time has just zoomed right by.

772
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,000
我得走了
I got to run.

773
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,500
勒西  和你吃饭很愉快
This was fun, Lexi.

774
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:32,700
至于项链的事  我会
And as far as the necklace goes, well, I would...

775
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,400
我会继续找的
I would keep looking.
