{\an8}《局外人》前情提要

19
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,140
从现在起  我们要假定
From now on, we have to assume that

20
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,300
它能通过克劳德看和听
whatever Claude sees and hears it sees and hears.

21
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,920
你问我我家人葬在哪
You asked me where my people are buried around here.

22
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,470
那个古老的熊洞  1947年后就被封住了
The old Bear Cave. It's been sealed since 1947.

23
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,140
他在那里面  我们找到他了
He's in there. We found him.

24
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,750
我们几小时后就回来了
We're gonna be back in a couple of hours.

25
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,710
这不对  不告诉他到底发生了什么
It's not right. Not telling them that that thing's out there.

26
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,190
如果它无法受控呢
What if it doesn't cotton to being contained?

27
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,650
那我们就在它杀死我们之前杀了它
Then we kill it before it can kill us.

28
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,250
如果它永生不灭呢
What if it can't be killed?

29
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,110
你知道你刚刚做了什么吗
Do you know what you just did?

30
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:45,080
我当然知道
I know what I just did.

31
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,060
我让你保住了小命
I gave you the heads up of your life.

32
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,860
他在我的脑子里  西里
He's in my head, Seale.

33
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,080
所以你刚刚告诉了这个玩意
So, you just told that thing

34
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,450
所有人都冲他去了
that all of those people are coming for it.

35
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,490
好嘞
There you go!

36
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:41,020
-天啊  -该死
- Jesus Christ! - Fuck!

37
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,100
我们得离开这里
We gotta get outta here.

38
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,250
-去哪  -我不知道  但我们得离开这里
- And go where? - I don't know. Just to get the fuck outta here.

39
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,670
枪手是谁
Who's the shooter?

40
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,320
杰克  我们可以谈谈
Jack! We can talk about this!

41
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,150

Oh, yeah, get in there.

47
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,970
-天啊  -别停  走

48
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,920
-那是佩里吗  -快走

00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,560

来自地狱的面包屑
Breadcrumbs from hell.

154
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,560
{\an8}熊洞

155
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,610
停下
Stop.

156
00:16:58,290 --> 00:16:59,770
他原本陷入了疯狂
He was in a frenzy.

157
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,590
-豪丽  -怎么了
- Holly. - Hmm?

158
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,220
你看
Look.

159
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,360
一切始于这里
This is where it happened.

160
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:23,410
他们的名字都在这
They're all in there.

161
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,100
它肯定一直在疯狂地找他们
Must have been going crazy trying to get to them.

162
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,340
-豪丽  -怎么了
- Holly. - Hmm?

163
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,180
看见了吗
See it?

164
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,960
光
The light?

165
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,780
进来时小心脚下
Watch your step coming in.

166
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,710
地面很滑
It's very slippery.

167
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:47,530
不想滑倒时要扶什么  就靠墙走
Stay close to the walls in case you need to grab onto something.

168
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:52,820
你们好不容易来这里  可不想回去吧
You haven't come all this way just to turn back now, have you?

169
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,920
你好  警长
Well, howdy there, sheriff.

170
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,850
你肯定就是那位美丽的豪丽小姐
And you must be the lovely Miss Holly.

171
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,170
克劳德不知道你姓什么
Claude doesn't know your last name,

172
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,770
但他一直想着你
but he thinks about you all the time.

173
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,200
我姓吉布尼
It's Gibney.

174
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,180
豪丽·吉布尼
Holly Gibney.

175
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:42,760
我陷入这种处境
It's you I have to thank

176
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:45,830
还得谢谢你  不是吗
for this situation I find myself in, ain't it?

177
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,260
我想知道是什么让你这么
I wanna know what made it so easy for you

178
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,900
轻易地相信我的存在
to believe in me,

179
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,230
她又是如何设法说服
and how on earth did she manage

180
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,440
你这样的牛仔的  警长
to convince a cowpoke like you, sheriff.

181
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:02,750
你是什么
What are you?

182
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,550
-你叫什么  -知道吗
- What is your name? - Oh... you know.

183
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,500
你来自哪里
Where did you come from?

184
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,300
-我不记得了  -你的本来面目是什么
- I don't remember. - What is your nature?

185
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,300
我们是不是不太擅长回答彼此的问题  
We're not very good answering each other's questions, are we?

186
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,370
-你们还有更多吗  -为什么这么问
- Are there more of you? - Why?

187
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,680
你之前见过我这样的吗
Have you seen someone like me before?

188
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,790
还有其他的睡仙吗
Are there others?

189
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,890
因为我也曾经觉得...
'Cause there have been times when I...

190
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,720
-有更多的...  -闭嘴
- sense there could be more-- - Shut up.

191
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,840
你不是想真的开枪吧  警长
You really gon' pull that trigger, sheriff?

192
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,000
如果你不怕死的话
Well, you go ahead and do it...

193
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,730
可以开枪试试
if you don't mind dying.

194
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:02,920
真的克劳德·博尔顿会站起来吗
Will the real Claude Bolton please stand up?

195
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,500
-看见没  -退后
- You see? - Step back!

196
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,450
别喊了
Stop yelling.

197
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:33,080
他们在这  那些死人
They're here, you know. The dead.

198
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:37,040
营救的人都救不了自己
The rescuers that couldn't even rescue themselves.

199
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:40,190
但你找不到他们  对吧
But... you couldn't get to them, could you?

200
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:45,700
那无所谓了  我能感知他们的存在
Well, it don't matter. I still feel their presence.

201
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:50,490
尤其是四个博尔顿家的  他们散发着光芒
Especially the four Boltons. They give off such a glow.

202
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,410
光芒
Glow?

203
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:58,340
他们是我慢慢成为的血液
They're the blood that I'm becoming.

204
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,670
这感觉
It feels like...

205
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,200
感觉有东西进入了我
like I'm being entered.

206
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,650
无论那是什么  都充满了我全身
And what enters me, fills me.

207
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,570
你根本不知道那种感觉
You have no idea what it feels like to have

208
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,390
浑身充满各种情感
all of that emotion inside of me.

209
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:16,500
为什么选孩子
Why children?

210
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,260
别再问问题了
Stop asking him questions!

211
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,970
我进食是为了生存  和你一样
I eat to survive, just like you.

212
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:25,770
-闭嘴  -为什么选孩子
- Shut up. - Why children?

213
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,220
因为他们的味道更甜美
'Cause they taste the sweetest.

214
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,910
-禽兽  -站住
- Motherfucker! - Stop!

215
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:35,950
他有毒
He's poison.

216
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,120
我不能让你们离开
I can't let you leave.

217
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,730
你知道  对吧
You know that, right?

218
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,710
不
No.

219
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,090
是我们不能让你离开
We're the ones who can't let you leave.

220
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,770
杰克留了一个我们的人在外面
Jack left one of us out there.

221
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:02,160
他知道我们在里面  他也知道你是什么
He knows we're in here and he knows what you are.

222
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,460
他会派增援
He'll send more.

223
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:05,760
这样
I see.

224
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,330
但我得进食
But I need to eat.

225
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,180
克劳德
Claude.

226
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,840
把枪放下
Put the gun down.

227
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,220
别开枪
Don't shoot.

228
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:28,990
别开枪  如果你开枪
Don't shoot. If you shoot,

229
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,540
整个地方都会塌
the whole chamber will fall on our heads.

230
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:33,650
克劳德
Hey, Claude.

231
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:37,390
把手指从扳机上移开  好吗
Just take your finger off the trigger, okay?

232
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,510
克劳德  就...
Claude, just...

233
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,060
看着我们
Just look at us.

234
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,770
看着我们
Just look at us.

235
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,080
就这样
That's it.

236
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,940
把枪放下
Now-- Now put the gun down.

237
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,570
我的天
Oh, my God.

238
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,050
开始坍塌了
It's collapsing.

239
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,770
逃  快逃  豪丽
Move! Now! Now! Holly!

240
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:31,120
克劳德
Claude!

241
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,610
豪丽
Holly!

242
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,720
护住脑袋  缩进衣服
Cover your head! Tuck your head!

243
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,930
这边
Over here.

244
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,990
-我动不了  -等等  见鬼
- I can't move. - Hold on-- Oh, shit.

245
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,820
好吧
Okay.

246
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,330
准备好了吗
Ready?

247
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:37,010
-三  二  一  -好了
- Three, two, one. Yeah. - Okay.

248
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,080
好了吗
You got it?

249
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,880
天哪
Oh, man.

250
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,110
-你还好吗  -嗯  死不了
- You okay? - Yeah, I'll live.

251
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,440
说了让你别开枪
Told you not to shoot.

252
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,260
好了  我们马上回来  抓紧
Okay. We'll be back in a moment, okay? Hold tight.

253
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:01,480
好的
All right.

254
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,580
该死
Ah, fuck.

255
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,900
你有刀之类的东西吗
Do you have some kind of knife?

256
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:37,500
很好
Good.

257
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,160
豪丽  别管了  不用拔了
Yeah, Holly. Leave it. Leave it. Leave it.

258
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,330
如果我们说是这东西杀了
If we were ever to claim that this thing

259
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,040
弗兰基·皮特森  他们会以为是我们疯了
killed Frankie Peterson, they'll write us off as loons.

260
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,910
就无法证明泰瑞是清白的
Terry's name will never be cleared.

261
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,590
泰瑞是谁
Who's Terry?

262
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,590
我杀死他了吗
Did I kill him?

263
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:16,600
对  对
Yeah. Yeah.

264
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,700
好了  兄弟
Okay, buddy.

265
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,440
我们数到三一起  好吗
We do this on three, yeah?

266
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,220
-好的  三  二  一  -二  一
- Okay. Three, two, one. - Two, one.

267
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:29,830
该死
Ah, shit.

268
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,810
-小心碰头  -好的
- Watch your head. - All right.

269
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,170
该死
Ah, man.

270
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,340
怎么了
What's wrong?

271
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,370
-没事  我马上来  -好的
- Nothing, I'll catch up. - Okay.

272
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,310
现在看着你装死
Now look at you playing possum.

273
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,250
我怎么知道的吗
How I know?

274
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,970
你心脏左边是什么
What's left of your heart.

275
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,580
无论是什么  它还在跳动
Whatever it's called, it's still pumpin'.

276
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,590
而且你没流出什么东西
Otherwise, you got nothin' comin' out.

277
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,690
木屑
Sawdust.

278
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,190
我不知道你能不能被杀死
I didn't know whether or not you could be killed.

279
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:53,210
我曾觉得你像其他人一样可以  但
I thought you could be like anyone else, but...

280
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,480
我不再那么确定了
I'm not so sure anymore.

281
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:01,290
我知道  那把刀确实
I know that, uh, this knife's certainly...

282
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:05,860
没有达到预期的效果  依我看
isn't doing the trick. Here's how I see it.

283
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,430
你很虚弱  你变得越来越虚弱
You're weak. You're getting weaker.

284
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,290
你没法跑
You can't run.

285
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:12,180
你无处藏
You can't hide.

286
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,000
你不能捕猎
You can't hunt,

287
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,290
这意味着你无法喂饱自己
which means you can't feed and fill yourself.

288
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:22,050
我可以马上轻易地离开这里了
There's nothing stopping me from just walking outta here right now,

289
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:24,810
带回一大车的游客  就看着他们
come back with a bus load of tourists and just watch them

290
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:27,010
他妈的推推搡搡
fucking push each other out of the way,

291
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,990
不顾一切地试图找到最好的角度
desperate, trying to get the best angle of

292
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:31,220
看看你残破的臭脸
what's left of your fucking face.

293
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:47,380
然后轮到好奇的科学团体
And then comes the ever curious scientific community.

294
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:50,520
他们一定会对你很感兴趣
They're gonna be real interested in you.

295
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:54,840
刺探  调查  注射  提取
Poking, probing, injecting, extracting.

296
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,630
他们会在你身上做切片
They'll cut little pieces of you off,

297
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,080
带回实验室
take it back to the lab,

298
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:04,240
就一直他妈的一片  一片  一片切你的肉
Just keep fucking carving you and carving you and carving you

299
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,520
直到
until...

300
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:09,800
对  你不想那样  对吧
Yeah, you wouldn't want that, would ya?

301
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:21,140
如果没有人知道你的存在
And it would serve our purposes

302
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,160
那样
much better...

303
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:28,000
对我们来说更好
if no one ever knew that you ever existed.

304
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,270
所以
So...

305
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:01,000
你必须消失
you gotta go.

306
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,900
他
He, uh...

307
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,470
他是为了我才来的
He came here to be with me.

308
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,270
这是唯一的理由
That was the only reason.

309
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:46,430
豪丽  当地警方随时都会来
Holly, the locals could appear at any stage.

310
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:48,890
我们需要赶快讨论一下
We need to talk pretty fast.

311
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:51,630
统一一下我们的说辞
Get our story straight.

312
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,220
佐治亚州调查局萨布洛副队来电
Lieutenant Sablo from GBI.

313
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,640
-我是海耶斯  -海耶斯  我是萨布洛
- Hayes. - Hayes, it's Sablo.

314
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:58,090
我们在田纳西州的西塞尔镇
We're down here in Cecil, Tennessee.

315
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,630
在一停车场发生了枪战
There was a shootout in the parking lot.

316
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:03,450
礼品店外  亚力克·佩里死了
The gift shop, Alec Pelley's dead.

317
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:07,120
霍伊·所罗门和杰克·霍斯金也死了
Howie Saloman is dead. Jack Hoskins is dead.

318
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,050
他们死了
They're dead?

319
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:14,460
枪手是个警察  你们自己人
The shooter was a cop. One of your own.

320
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:17,520
但他不是自己作的案
But he didn't act alone.

321
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,810
事实上  他是被人强迫的
In fact, he was compelled to kill by someone else.

322
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,430
他还有同伙吗
Like... he had an accomplice?

323
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,510
{\an8}杰克·霍斯金

324
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,530
不  我不是说霍斯金有同伙
No, I'm saying Hoskins was the accomplice.

325
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:28,270
我觉得杀害弗兰基·皮特森的真正凶手
The alpha who I believe killed Frankie Peterson

326
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:29,470
仍未被我们抓到
is still out there.

327
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,130
在两天前  他企图
He attempted to grab another boy

328
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:33,490
抓住这里的另一个男孩
down here two nights ago.

329
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:34,500
他逃跑了
He got away,

330
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:38,040
但是有人拍到他了  我给你发链接
but we got him on video, so I'm gonna send you the link.

331
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:39,530
等等  等等  慢着
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on, just, uh...

332
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,930
这不是谁的错  好吗
It's nobody's fault, okay?

333
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,670
但我觉得你办公室做出的一些决定
But I believe certain decisions coming out of your office

334
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,730
需要重新推敲一下  你同意吗
need to be revisited. Wouldn't you agree?

335
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:52,650
西里·博尔顿接到了一通
So, Seale Bolton receives a phone call

336
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:55,700
匿名电话  他自称是我的同事
from an unknown individual who says he works with me.

337
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:59,720
此无名氏自称他知道
This individual claims to have knowledge of the whereabouts

338
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,610
很可能是弗兰基·皮特森凶案嫌疑人的下落
of a more likely suspect in the Frankie Peterson murder.

339
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,210
告诉我到底发生了什么  克劳德
You wanna tell me what happened, Claude?

340
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:09,360
-我跟你说过了  -我想再听一遍
- I already told you. -Well, I'd like to hear it again.

341
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,990
萨布洛警探和安德森警探
Detective Sablo and Anderson,

342
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:16,210
在诺基郡地检打算重审弗兰克·皮特森凶案时
they came to interview me when the Cherokee County DA

343
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:19,190
来找我进行询问
was considering reopening the Frank Peterson homicide.

344
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,420
为什么找你
Why you?

345
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:22,840
因为我说是他们逮捕的嫌疑人
Because I identified the man they arrested for it,

346
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,130
泰瑞·梅特兰  走进桃子瓣时
Terry Maitland, when he walked into the Peach Crease,

347
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:25,820
全身是血
covered in blood.

348
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,250
但你越仔细想
But the more you thought about it...

349
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,560
但我越仔细想
Well, the more I thought about it,

350
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,120
我越意识到我犯了错  那不是他
the more I-- I realized I made a mistake. It wasn't him.

351
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,630
那只是和他长得有些相似的人  只是这样
It was just someone who looked a little like him. That's all.

352
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:37,840
皮特森凶案的证人
Witnesses from the Peterson homicide.

353
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,150
把审问记录拿给我
I need the transcripts from the interviews.

354
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:54,090
这个打电话的人明确说让你去哪找他了吗
This caller, did he specifically tell you where to find him?

355
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:57,730
是的  山那边废弃的礼品店
Yeah, the abandoned souvenir shop on the side of that hill,

356
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:58,940
所以我们就过去调查
so we went to investigate.

357
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:01,130
-你们去了那边  -是的  我的怀疑是
- You went there? - Yeah. My assumption is that

358
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:03,050
他是为了干掉克劳德·博尔顿才去的
he's there to take out Claude Bolton,

359
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,610
他觉得克劳德是个威胁
who he perceives as a threat.

360
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:05,960
你说的他是杰克·霍斯金吗
Him being Jack Hoskins.

361
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:08,720
他是你的队伍里的警探
The detective from your squad

362
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,630
因绑架  谋杀未遂而失踪
who's been in the wind for kidnapping, attempted murder.

363
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:12,910
同一个人
The same.

364
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:17,570
所以我把这通电话理解为
Yeah, so, I, uh... interpreted the phone call

365
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:20,090
一个陷阱
as being made to set up an ambush.

366
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,300
老实说  我以为整件事
Frankly, I thought the whole thing

367
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,120
会是一个骗局
was gonna turn out to be bullshit.

368
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,670
我错了
Was wrong.

369
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,490
他们会扣留我弟弟的遗体多久
How long they gonna keep my brother's body for?

370
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,400
希望不会太久
Hopefully not for too long.

371
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,480
不太久是多久
Well, how long is not too long?

372
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,820
克劳德  跟我说说电话的事
Claude, tell me about the phone call.

373
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,700
三月三日到七日
March 3rd through the 7th,

374
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,420
梅特兰最后一次去探望他父亲...
Maitland's last visit to see his father, um...

375
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:56,840
我在调查的过程中  遇见了卡卡瓦奇先生
On my investigation, I encountered Mr. Katcavage,

376
00:38:57,450 --> 00:39:01,780
...前代顿警察局探员  他这些年来
uh... former Dayton PD detective who had worked dozens

377
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:05,260
经手了十几起凶杀案  我发现他...
of homicides over the years. I found him...

378
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:10,910
我发现他能力很强
I found him, uh, highly competent,

379
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,100
所以我推荐我的雇主...
so I recommended that my employer...

380
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,150
雇请他加入团队
hire him as part of the team.

381
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,760
嗨  亲爱的  是我
Hey, darlin', it's me.

382
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,380
珍妮  如果我们要结束这件事
So if we're gonna pull this off, Jeannie,

383
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,030
我需要你做点事
there's something I need you to do.

384
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,030
谢谢  谢谢
Thank you. Thank you.

385
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:00,360
不管你接受还是拒绝那东西的存在
Whether you accept or reject the reality of that thing,

386
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,970
现在不重要  重要的是...
it's not important right now. What is important...

387
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:06,560
当他们问你
is that when they ask you,

388
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:08,660
他们肯定会问你
and they will definitely ask you

389
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:11,100
和豪丽·吉布尼见面的事
about that meeting with Holly Gibney,

390
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,870
请不要提到变形
please don't mention anything about shape shifters

391
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:21,280
睡仙  或其它听起来超自然的内容
or El Cucos or anything that might sound supernatural.

392
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,740
好吗
Okay?

393
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:25,160
否则...
Otherwise...

394
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,330
可以
I can do that.

395
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:57,040
梅特兰夫人  我今天过来告诉你  
What I've come to tell you today, Mrs. Maitland...

396
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,230
弗兰基·皮特森被害案件
is that there have been certain developments

397
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:05,590
已经取得一定进展
in the Frankie Peterson homicide case.

398
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:11,430
已经展开一些新的调查途径
Some new avenues of inquiry have opened.

399
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:19,860
我们正在重新启动这件案子
We're reopening the case.

400
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,280
那你们所谓一锤定音的法医鉴定呢
What about your slam dunk forensics?

401
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:31,390
我们重新检验了犯罪现场
Well, we reexamined the perp DNA

402
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:33,460
得到的罪犯基因
we got from the crime scene

403
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:36,810
发现我们实际拿到的是罪犯和受害者基因
and discovered that what we actually had was a mixture of samples,

404
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:39,390
混在一起的样本  这在法庭上是无效的
perp and the victim, which makes it unreliable in court.

405
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:42,710
孩子们  请回到楼上去
Girls, I need you to go upstairs, please.

406
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:55,580
星期一  我会举行一个记者招待会
On Monday, I'm holding a press conference

407
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:58,190
宣布重新开启调查...
to announce the reopening of the investigation...

408
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:05,380
正式对外宣布撤销
and to officially go on record regarding the dropping

409
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,450
对泰瑞·梅特兰的指控
of charges against Terry Maitland.

410
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:12,630
你们一家已经受够了折磨
Your family has suffered enough,

411
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,580
我只想尽可能...
and I just want to do whatever I...

412
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:27,260
因为你在起诉我和我办公室...
Because of your pending lawsuits against me and my office...

413
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:33,180
我不能向你表达我的心声
I have to refrain from telling you what is in my heart.

414
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,310
我完全理解
I completely understand.

415
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,580
他是来谴责你的吗
Was he mean to you?

416
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,500
不  亲爱的  他不是来谴责我的
No, my love, he wasn't mean to me.

417
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:32,820
飞机还是开车
Flying or driving?

418
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,580
开车
Driving.

419
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:39,580
大概要十小时吧  去芝加哥
About ten hours, right? Chicago?

420
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,010
-是的  -十小时吧
- Yeah. - Ten hours?

421
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:45,210
我在路上还要去几个地方
I have a couple of stops I have to make along the way.

422
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:49,340
要是以后还有机会
You know, I wouldn't mind teaming up again,

423
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,340
我不介意继续合作
the opportunity ever arose.

424
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:53,280
最好下次能有一些简单点的活
I mean, preferably on something simple

425
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,260
比如三重黑帮谋杀案之类的
like a gangland triple homicide. Something like that.

426
00:45:58,070 --> 00:45:59,680
我在东雪莉的时候
When I was in the caves,

427
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,540
睡仙问我  我为什么这么容易
El Cuco asked me, uh, why I was so open

428
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,730
接受了它的存在
to believing in its existence.

429
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:11,000
我的父亲曾经是军人  我小时候
My father was ex-military and when I was little,

430
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,280
他会说  "人才是最了解人的"
he would say, "A man knows a man."

431
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:19,800
要是我当时在洞穴里有时间思考
Well, if I had the time to think in that cave

432
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,560
并且要好好回答那个问题的话
and the inclination to answer that thing,

433
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,670
我会说
I would have said...

434
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:27,750
"局外人最了解局外人"
"An outsider knows an outsider."

435
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:54,820
霍莉  那里还有什么
Holly. What else is out there?

436
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,990
我从来没有告诉你  但是...我看到了德雷克
I never told you but... I saw Derek.

437
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:20,910
他...和我说话了
He... spoke to me.

438
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:24,510
-他说了什么  -那...
- What did he say? - Well, it--

439
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:26,910
那并不是德雷克  所以...
it wasn't Derek, so...

440
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,880
拉夫  告诉他说了什么  让我高兴一下也好
Ralph-- Tell me what he said. Just humor me.

441
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:34,630
他说我应该放他离开
He said that I need to let him go.

442
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:38,090
放他离开
Let him go?

443
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:42,390
想得美
Well, fat chance of that.

444
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:54,270
我不知道
I don't know.

445
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,700
我倒是觉得这次的经历
I like to think the way this whole experience...

446
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,280
打开了新的世界
cracked the world open.

447
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,870
也许他下一次再出现
Maybe the next time he appears,

448
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:07,330
就会是真正的德里克了
maybe it's gonna be the real Derek.

449
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:12,080
或者也许再过几年
Or maybe after a few years pass,

450
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,040
很多年
many more years,

451
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:16,090
我们就能去看他了
