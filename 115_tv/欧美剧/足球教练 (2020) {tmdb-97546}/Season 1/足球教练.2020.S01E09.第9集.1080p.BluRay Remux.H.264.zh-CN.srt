1
00:00:08,584 --> 00:00:11,084
我叫梅林达·戈登
My name is Melinda Gordon.

2
00:00:12,796 --> 00:00:15,673
刚结婚  刚搬来这个小镇
I just got married, just moved to a small town,

3
00:00:15,674 --> 00:00:17,800
刚开了间古董店
just opened up an antique shop.

4
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:20,301
我也许和你相似
I might be just like you.

5
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:22,680
但当我还是小姑娘时
Except from the time that I was a little girl,

6
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:25,850
我就能同亡者交流
I knew that I could talk to the dead.

7
00:00:25,851 --> 00:00:27,101
没事的  亲爱的
It's all right, honey.

8
00:00:27,102 --> 00:00:29,479
祖母称他们为地缚灵
Earthbound spirits, my grandmother called them,

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,855
他们在人间滞留
the ones who have not crossed over

10
00:00:30,856 --> 00:00:33,107
因为他们有未了的心愿
because they have unfinished business with the living.

11
00:00:33,108 --> 00:00:35,828
他们找我寻求帮助
And they come to me for help.

12
00:00:35,944 --> 00:00:40,464
讲述我的故事  就是讲述他们的故事
To tell you my story, I have to tell you theirs.

13
00:00:42,164 --> 00:00:46,099
不要调你的电视机

14
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:57,464
你现在听到的是超自然电子异象
俗称白噪声

15
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:01,377
服务员貌似没听懂你的幽默
You know, I don't think that waiter got your sense of humour.

16
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:03,462
是呀  因为他只顾着看你
Yeah, I think it's because he was looking at you so much,

17
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,381
根本就没听我说
he didn't even hear me.

18
00:01:05,382 --> 00:01:07,466
你明天去车站接你妈吗
Are you gonna pick up your mom tomorrow at the train?

19
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:10,386
不  她坚持坐出租车
No. No, no. She insists on taking a cab, you know.

20
00:01:10,387 --> 00:01:11,970
她从不轻易接受帮助
She likes to think she's low-maintenance.

21
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:14,306
我们不都一样
Ah, don't we all?

22
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:16,642
她总有自己的理由
She always has her reason.

23
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:19,143
怎么了
What?

24
00:01:19,521 --> 00:01:21,939
我明明把车停在这里了
This is exactly where I parked the car.

25
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,106
你确定
Are you sure?

26
00:01:23,107 --> 00:01:26,617
当然  我们差点被这裂缝给绊倒
Yeah. Remember? When we almost tripped over that crack there.

27
00:01:31,699 --> 00:01:34,535
真不爽
I am not enjoying this moment.

28
00:01:37,121 --> 00:01:40,624
晚上好  我车被偷了
Evening. I need to report a stolen car.

29
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:45,845
奥文顿大道415号  车主是梅林达·戈登
415, Ovington Avenue. Vehicle belongs to a Melinda Gordon.

30
00:01:49,467 --> 00:01:50,884
动作真快  比利
That was quick work, Billy.

31
00:01:50,885 --> 00:01:52,636
又没啥事儿  帮个忙而已
Hey, slow night. What can I say?

32
00:01:52,637 --> 00:01:54,638
他在附近交通违规  被我们抓住
We caught him running a stop sign a few blocks away.

33
00:01:54,639 --> 00:01:55,264
是吗
Oh, yeah?

34
00:01:55,265 --> 00:01:57,265
差点冲进这家的草坪
Damn near drove right over the lawn of this house.

35
00:01:57,266 --> 00:01:58,892
估计是飙车党
A joyride, I'm guessing.

36
00:01:58,893 --> 00:02:00,602
一个人飙车吗
A joyride of one?

37
00:02:00,603 --> 00:02:03,188
多次行为不端  但没有前科
He's got a couple of misdemeanours, no major priors.

38
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:05,398
你们准备怎么办
What you guys wanna do?

39
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,150
迈尔斯·詹森  男孩的父亲
Miles Jensen, the boy's father.

40
00:02:07,151 --> 00:02:08,818
我为此向你们道歉
I really apologise for this.

41
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:12,405
我儿子正值逆反心理旺盛期
My son, he's in that troublemaker phase, I guess.

42
00:02:12,406 --> 00:02:14,574
值得庆幸的是  没有人受伤
No one was hurt. That's all that matters.

43
00:02:14,575 --> 00:02:17,160
我有个不情之请
I know this is asking a lot,

44
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:19,287
能否不起诉他
but would you consider not pressing charges?

45
00:02:19,288 --> 00:02:21,788
我会赔偿一切损失
I'll pay for the damage.

46
00:02:23,334 --> 00:02:25,834
可以
Sure. Yeah. It's okay.

47
00:02:25,836 --> 00:02:27,921
万分感谢
I really appreciate that.

48
00:02:27,922 --> 00:02:30,507
我不知道这孩子怎么了
I don't know what is with the kid.

49
00:02:30,508 --> 00:02:32,238
真希望他能一觉醒来突然开窍
Sometimes I wish he'd wake up, be 21

50
00:02:32,238 --> 00:02:34,568
别再这么不懂事
and have all this teen crap behind him.

51
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:47,031
亲爱的
Honey.

52
00:03:04,374 --> 00:03:06,994
他把你的电台调乱了
He messed with your stations.

53
00:03:07,586 --> 00:03:10,786
我们真该起诉他  调头回去
We should prosecute. Let's go back.

54
00:03:10,798 --> 00:03:11,832
知道我怎么想吗
Hey, you know what my problem is?

55
00:03:11,832 --> 00:03:13,566
我想一觉醒来能回到16岁
I need to wake up, be 16

56
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:16,507
不用管成人的烦心事
and get over all this adult crap.

57
00:03:16,637 --> 00:03:19,357
等一下  靠边停一下
Hold on. Pull over for a sec.

58
00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:27,980
这是手机信号  还是什么
What, are those cell phone transmissions? What?

59
00:03:27,981 --> 00:03:29,440
恐怕不是
I don't think so.

60
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:31,275
我觉得这是灵魂的声音
I think these are spirit voices.

61
00:03:31,276 --> 00:03:33,000
慢着  我是正常人  怎么能听见
Wait a minute. Normal guy. How come I can hear them?

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,417
我不知道
I'm not sure.

63
00:03:34,418 --> 00:03:35,710
你怎么知道那是灵魂
How do you know they're spirits?

64
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:38,271
感觉  我能感觉到
I feel it. I can feel them.

65
00:03:38,505 --> 00:03:40,047
怎么  车闹鬼了
What, the car's haunted?

66
00:03:40,048 --> 00:03:41,716
我不清楚
I don't know.

67
00:03:41,717 --> 00:03:43,280
我从没遇到过
I've never run into this before.

68
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,844
这现象还有个名字来着
There's a name for it.

69
00:03:44,845 --> 00:03:47,345
酷  其实是毛骨悚然
Cool. I mean, creepy.

70
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:58,733
我在这
I am here.

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
鬼语者  第一季  第9集
灵异之音

72
00:04:33,809 --> 00:04:38,469
有人吗  护理帅哥跑哪去了
Hello? Is there a handsome paramedic in this house?

73
00:04:39,565 --> 00:04:41,941

You have 4 messages.

You were right about the estate sale in Lakemont.

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,489

Give me a call.

78
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:49,235
吉姆  我是汤米

Can you take the 4:00 to 12:00 shift next Tuesday?

80
00:05:11,888 --> 00:05:13,264
你没事吧
You all right?

81
00:05:13,265 --> 00:05:15,765
你听见这个没
Do you hear that?

82
00:05:15,976 --> 00:05:19,676
一点点  不知道是啥
Barely, but yeah. Don't know what it is.

83
00:05:20,355 --> 00:05:21,564
没事吧
You okay?

84
00:05:21,565 --> 00:05:23,983
还好  就是突然有点头疼  
Yeah. Yeah, except for a headache all of a sudden.

85
00:05:23,984 --> 00:05:25,818
好了
All right.

86
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:27,319
没事了
It'll be all right.

87
00:05:29,197 --> 00:05:33,807
我妈刚到你就头疼  有意思
You get a headache, my mother arrives. Interesting.

Melinda, darling.

92
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:45,129

见到你很高兴
Nice to meet you.

101

Isn't he sweet?

103
00:06:06,275 --> 00:06:07,484
他是谁
Who is he?

104
00:06:07,485 --> 00:06:09,027
你知道的
Well, you know who.

105
00:06:09,028 --> 00:06:10,404
我不知道
I don't.

106
00:06:10,405 --> 00:06:12,364
他是...
He's my...

107
00:06:12,365 --> 00:06:14,700
说男朋友太荒唐了  是不是
Well, boyfriend is just ridiculous, isn't it?

108
00:06:14,701 --> 00:06:16,910
他是一位特别的朋友
He's a special friend.

109
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:19,204
男朋友  妈  你没说过
Boyfriend. Mom, you didn't mention this.

110
00:06:19,205 --> 00:06:21,832
没有吗  梅林达  你真是美极了
Didn't I? Melinda, you look wonderful.

111
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,209
挚友  你也是楚楚动人
And you, Faith, you're just glowing.

112
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:25,377
妈...
Mom...

113
00:06:25,378 --> 00:06:28,505
吉姆  别问了  我自会解释的
Jim, please don't be boring about this. I'll explain more later.

114
00:06:28,506 --> 00:06:30,423
这房子真漂亮
What a fantastic house, gee.

115
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:32,676
-我来拿  -谢谢
- Yeah. Great. I got it. - Thanks.

116
00:06:32,677 --> 00:06:33,885
亲爱的  这边走
Here, darling.

117
00:06:36,973 --> 00:06:38,139
饿了吗
Anyone hungry?

118
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,640
饿极了
Yeah. Sure.

119
00:06:40,935 --> 00:06:42,852
真是美味
This is yummy.

120
00:06:42,853 --> 00:06:44,053
太棒了
Wonderful.

121
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:49,754
你应该先付钱的
Hey. You're supposed to pay for those.

122
00:06:49,755 --> 00:06:51,548
先记下
Keeping track.

123
00:06:51,549 --> 00:06:54,926
好吧  你和埃利斯怎么了
All right. What's up with you and Ellis?

124
00:06:54,927 --> 00:06:56,261
我们怎么了
What about me and Ellis?

125
00:06:56,262 --> 00:06:58,542
你俩没说过半句话
You haven't spoken two words to the guy.

126
00:07:00,308 --> 00:07:02,008
没什么
It's nothing.

127
00:07:03,102 --> 00:07:04,811
你看不惯他和你妈妈在一起吧
Does it bother you that him and your mom...

128
00:07:04,812 --> 00:07:08,315
嘿  嘿  非得说穿吗
Hey, hey, hey. Do we have to put a name on it, huh?

129
00:07:08,316 --> 00:07:10,442
真搞不懂  他看上去挺不错
I don't get it. He seems like a perfectly nice guy.

130
00:07:10,443 --> 00:07:12,431
那他干嘛搭讪那金发女孩
Then how come he's checking out that blonde

131
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,945
而不是我妈妈
who is clearly not my mother?

132
00:07:13,946 --> 00:07:15,397
吉姆  因为
Because, Jim, 

133
00:07:15,398 --> 00:07:19,993
那个金发女孩拿着甜点
that blonde is a Nordic goddess with huge pastries.

134
00:07:19,994 --> 00:07:22,120
看一眼可不是什么罪过
A priest would be forgiven for glancing.

135
00:07:22,121 --> 00:07:24,789
那可不是看  那是秋波  拜托
That's not a glance. That's a leer. Come on.

136
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:27,542
我不清楚  只是感觉有些不对
I don't know. It just... Something doesn't feel right.

137
00:07:27,543 --> 00:07:30,128
你父亲去世后  你妈妈有约会过吗
Has your mom dated anybody since your dad passed away?

138
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:31,963
据我所知没有
Not that I know of.

139
00:07:31,964 --> 00:07:34,464
那不就得了
Say no more.

140
00:07:40,973 --> 00:07:42,807
不敢相信
I can't believe

141
00:07:42,808 --> 00:07:45,226
你居然安排他们住不同的房间
you tried to put their bags in separate rooms.

142
00:07:45,527 --> 00:07:46,853
我开玩笑的
I was kidding.

143
00:07:46,854 --> 00:07:49,391
-他们是成年人了  -我总觉得
- They are adults. - I don't know.

144
00:07:49,392 --> 00:07:51,566
那个埃利斯哪里不对劲
Something about this Ellis guy just doesn't seem right.

145
00:07:51,567 --> 00:07:53,043
你知道他们怎么认识的吗
You know how they met?

146
00:07:53,044 --> 00:07:54,861
他帮我妈安装新的警报系统
He was installing her new alarm system.

147
00:07:54,862 --> 00:07:56,696
我觉得他很温柔很有魅力
He seems sweet and charming to me.

148
00:07:56,697 --> 00:07:59,657
好吧  你喜欢就喜欢呗
Yeah, yeah, if you like that sort of thing.

149
00:07:59,658 --> 00:08:01,451
到底怎么了
What is this really about?

150
00:08:01,452 --> 00:08:03,786
我不知道  只是  你知道吗
I don't know. It's just... You know what it is?

151
00:08:03,787 --> 00:08:05,621
他太好了  我不信他
He's too nice. I'm not buying it.

152
00:08:05,622 --> 00:08:07,373
疑心病
Oh. Cynical.

153
00:08:07,374 --> 00:08:09,884
我爸爸去世五年了
Dad's been dead five years.

154
00:08:13,755 --> 00:08:16,132
他真是和我爸爸太不一样了
He's just... He's really different from my dad.

155
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:18,200
你要接受事实
You know, maybe you should just get used to the idea

156
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,260
你妈妈在谈恋爱
that your mother is dating.

157
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:26,383
-你怎么了  -没什么  又头疼
- Are you all right? - Yeah. Damn headache.

158
00:08:26,384 --> 00:08:28,385
手给我  和上次一样的症状吗
Give me that. Is it the same as the ones before?

159
00:08:28,386 --> 00:08:31,388
恩  留言机里又发出奇怪声音了
Yeah. There were weird voices again on the answering machine.

160
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:35,100
我听了两次  整晚都很难受
I listened to them twice and I've been sick all night.

161
00:08:35,101 --> 00:08:37,601
不要再听了
Don't listen to them.

162
00:08:38,563 --> 00:08:40,981
够男人  我喜欢
That is so male. I love that.

163
00:08:40,982 --> 00:08:42,858
本色而已
It seems simple to me.

164
00:08:42,859 --> 00:08:44,651
你肯定这现象无法解释吗
Look, are you sure these things aren't explainable,

165
00:08:44,652 --> 00:08:47,154
-比如手机信号  -恩  没解释
- I mean, like cell phone transmissions? - No, they're not.

166
00:08:47,155 --> 00:08:49,531
你知道我如何感知灵魂的吗
You know how I can sense spirits,

167
00:08:49,532 --> 00:08:51,325
我能感受到他们的感受
like I can feel what they're feeling?

168
00:08:51,326 --> 00:08:52,458
现在我超负荷了
Now I'm on overload.

169
00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:55,621
就像一次吃得太撑了
It's like tasting too many foods at once.

170
00:08:55,622 --> 00:08:58,082
我不愿见你为此难受
I don't like this is making you sick.

171
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,710
我去帮你拿阿司匹林
Should I get you some aspirin?

172
00:09:01,711 --> 00:09:05,130
你知道治头痛的特效药是什么
You know what always makes my headaches go away?

173
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:07,631
当然
Oh, yeah.

174
00:09:26,778 --> 00:09:29,405
等一下  别关门
Wait. Hold those doors.

175
00:09:29,489 --> 00:09:31,989
请等一下  谢谢
Please. Thank you.

176
00:09:32,617 --> 00:09:34,659
谢谢  你真好
Thanks. You're a pal.

177
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,995
帮我省了半小时
Probably saved me about a half an hour.

178
00:09:36,996 --> 00:09:38,205
你去哪层
Which floor?

179
00:09:38,206 --> 00:09:40,706
和你一样
Well, same as you.

180
00:09:41,334 --> 00:09:42,792
你是要去找霍夫曼博士吗
Are you here to see Dr. Huffman?

181
00:09:42,793 --> 00:09:44,586
-你怎么知道  -我通灵
- How did you know? - Psychic.

182
00:09:44,587 --> 00:09:47,505
再说三楼只有他一间办公室
That, and there's only one office on the third floor.

183
00:09:47,506 --> 00:09:50,635
这么说你就是霍夫曼博士
Which makes you Dr. Huffman.

184
00:09:51,469 --> 00:09:52,802
你好像有点惊讶
You seem a little surprised.

185
00:09:52,803 --> 00:09:54,800
没有  非常抱歉  只是
Oh, no. No. I'm sorry. It's just...

186
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,059
-打电话时觉得你会年长些  -哦
- You sounded older on the phone. - Yeah.

187
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,393
事实上我好几位女朋友
I've actually had a lot of blind dates

188
00:10:00,394 --> 00:10:02,321
起初都这么说我
which began with that same phrasing.

189
00:10:03,522 --> 00:10:04,648
我是梅林达·戈登
Melinda Gordon.

190
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:06,603
今早找你谈过我的留言信息
We talked this morning about my messages.

191
00:10:06,664 --> 00:10:09,069
是的
Oh, yes! Of course.

192
00:10:09,737 --> 00:10:11,529
超自然电子异像
Electronic voice phenomenon.

193
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:13,948
我们研究噪音的简称为EVP
EVP, as we noise geeks like to say.

194
00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:15,492
对了  你对这东西了解多少
Well, how much do you know about it?

195
00:10:15,493 --> 00:10:17,368
不多  就从网上看到过
Oh, not much. Just what I learnt on the net.

196
00:10:17,369 --> 00:10:19,579
你的名字不断出现在搜索结果中
Your name kept coming up in my searches.

197
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:23,375
正是我要找的EVP专家
You seem to be the go-to guy for EVP.

198
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:26,670
协会主席可不这么认为
Yet the chairman of my department remains unimpressed.

199
00:10:27,671 --> 00:10:29,505
要来点儿奶酪吗
Would you care for some cheese?

200
00:10:29,506 --> 00:10:30,882
熏制的荷兰干酪
Smoked Gouda.

201
00:10:30,883 --> 00:10:33,677
不用了  谢谢
Oh. I'm good. Thanks.

202
00:10:33,927 --> 00:10:37,096
你大部分时间都在研究超自然现象吗
So do you mostly work in paranormal studies?

203
00:10:37,097 --> 00:10:40,058
我不认为这是超自然
Well, I don't think of it as paranormal.

204
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:43,895
我试图用科学来解释
I'm simply trying to apply scientific explanation

205
00:10:43,896 --> 00:10:46,022
这些不可解释的现象
to phenomena that seem unexplainable.

206
00:10:46,023 --> 00:10:47,690
EVP现象很普遍吗
Is EVP common?

207
00:10:47,691 --> 00:10:50,234
不好说  我们没做过统计
Hard to know. We don't exactly keep statistics.

208
00:10:50,235 --> 00:10:52,029
大多数声音都传播于
Most of the voices seem to mostly come through

209
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:55,114
广播电台的空频带中
the vacant bandwidth between regular broadcast stations.

210
00:10:55,115 --> 00:10:56,824
但它不仅出现在电台中
But it's not just radio, you know.

211
00:10:56,825 --> 00:10:58,159
任何电子设备都有可能
It could happen with anything electronic.

212
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,538
包括电视  显示屏  录像机等等
TVs, monitors, VCRs, et cetera.

213
00:11:01,622 --> 00:11:05,791
大多数人不知其所以然
Most people really don't know exactly how or why it works.

214
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:08,262
所以认为是鬼魂发出的
Most people believe it's caused by ghosts.

215
00:11:09,463 --> 00:11:12,882
-你相信鬼魂吗  -你呢
- Do you believe in ghosts? - Do you?

216
00:11:12,883 --> 00:11:14,467
我若如实回答
I'd answer that truthfully,

217
00:11:14,468 --> 00:11:16,093
估计会掉饭碗
but I may be endangering my tenure.

218
00:11:16,094 --> 00:11:20,664
这么说吧  我比较开明
Let's just say I... I like to keep an open mind.

219
00:11:21,308 --> 00:11:26,061
-你说收到几条留言  -是的
- Now, you said you have messages. - Oh. Yes.

220
00:11:26,062 --> 00:11:29,023
那声音在其它留言之后
The voices are hidden under my other messages.

221
00:11:29,024 --> 00:11:36,237
我在车载广播里也听过  给你
And I'm also hearing voices on my car radio.Here.

222
00:11:41,995 --> 00:11:44,748
还好你没吃奶酪  难吃死了
Good call on the cheese, by the way. It's dreadful.

223
00:11:45,749 --> 00:11:47,082
我都被弄疯了
It's just been driving me crazy

224
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,543
完全不明白说的是什么
that I can't understand what's being said.

225
00:11:49,544 --> 00:11:53,484
看  这有很多音频变形  看这儿
See, there's a lot of warping. Watch this.

226
00:11:56,843 --> 00:11:58,761
非常典型
Very typical.

227
00:11:58,762 --> 00:12:01,054
大部分的声音像是在谈话
Most of the voices seem to be in mid-conversation,

228
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:03,056
一部分是在提问
some asking questions.

229
00:12:03,057 --> 00:12:05,684
突然有个女人的声音
There's one female voice which seems to pop.

230
00:12:05,685 --> 00:12:07,186
她好像不是在谈话
She doesn't seem to be in conversation

231
00:12:07,187 --> 00:12:11,064
像是想让别人听她说话
as much as trying to get someone to hear her.

232
00:12:11,065 --> 00:12:12,649
你看上去不太舒服
You suddenly seem unwell.

233
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,151
不  我没事
No, I'm good.

234
00:12:14,152 --> 00:12:18,012
你能告诉我他们在说什么吗
Can you just tell me what they're saying?

235
00:12:23,286 --> 00:12:25,786
我在
I am...

236
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,540
我在等
I am waiting...

237
00:12:30,585 --> 00:12:33,085
我在等你
I am waiting for you.

238
00:12:35,223 --> 00:12:38,267
你认为是这声音让你不舒服吗
And you think these voices are making you sick?

239
00:12:38,268 --> 00:12:39,476
跟声音没什么关系
It's not so much the voices.

240
00:12:39,477 --> 00:12:42,437
只是一次出现太多鬼了
It's just a lot of spirit stuff happening all at once.

241
00:12:42,438 --> 00:12:43,647
我的头都震痛了
I feel like my head's vibrating.

242
00:12:43,648 --> 00:12:46,608
你面色有些苍白
You are looking a little green around the gills.

243
00:12:46,609 --> 00:12:48,402
你的面色也不错
You look good, too.

244
00:12:48,403 --> 00:12:49,528
你为什么不回家休息
Why don't you just go home?

245
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:50,654
店里的事我能应付
You know, I can handle things here.

246
00:12:50,655 --> 00:12:53,455
别傻了  我好得很
Don't be ridiculous. I'm fine.

247
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:23,270
克莱蒙在树丛里
Claremont in the woods.

248
00:13:25,356 --> 00:13:27,315
克莱蒙是谁
Claremont?

249
00:13:27,316 --> 00:13:29,985
抱歉  我得走了
I'm sorry. I have to go.

250
00:13:45,985 --> 00:13:48,585
克莱蒙小径

251
00:13:49,421 --> 00:13:50,921
现在怎么办
Now what?

252
00:14:19,867 --> 00:14:23,328
你是谁  来这干什么
Who are you? What are you doing here?

253
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,038
我是谁
Who am I?

254
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:26,823
我是被你偷过车的那位
I'm the woman whose car you stole.

255
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,500
你应该对我礼貌些
And you should try being polite.

256
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:31,503
要谢谢我没把你送进监狱
Thanks to me, you're not stuck in jail right now.

257
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:32,796
回答我的问题
Answer my question.

258
00:14:32,797 --> 00:14:35,924
你先回答  你来这干什么
You first. What are you doing here?

259
00:14:35,925 --> 00:14:38,510
我在散步  这是天然小径
I'm walking. It's a trail, man.

260
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:40,470
你也是被引到这来的吗
Were you led here, too?

261
00:14:40,471 --> 00:14:43,598
你在说什么  谁会引我到这
What are you talking about? Led here by who?

262
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:45,642
有人告诉我到这来
Someone told me to come here.

263
00:14:45,643 --> 00:14:48,523
一个女人  她也告诉过你吗
A woman. Did she tell you, too?

264
00:14:49,271 --> 00:14:52,601
你也听到那声音了是吗
You hear the voices, too, don't you?

265
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,443
你
You're...

266
00:14:55,444 --> 00:14:56,694
你这疯子
You're nuts, okay?

267
00:14:56,695 --> 00:15:00,315
我不知道你胡说八道些什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

268
00:15:08,832 --> 00:15:11,042
你不必这样  我睡一觉就好了
You don't have to do this. I'll feel better in the morning.

269
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:13,795
当然要做  反正我也睡不着
Of course I do. I can't sleep anyhow.

270
00:15:13,796 --> 00:15:16,676
别告诉我  你在烦你妈的事
Don't tell me you're obsessing.

271
00:15:17,466 --> 00:15:19,133
如果他是骗子怎么办
What if he's a gold digger?

272
00:15:19,134 --> 00:15:20,885
如果他看上我妈的钱怎么办
I mean, what if he's just after her money?

273
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:23,388
你希望门当户对是吧
This is a class thing, isn't it?

274
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:25,098
我以为你了解我
I think you know me better than that.

275
00:15:25,099 --> 00:15:26,404
拜托  承认吧
Come on, admit it.

276
00:15:26,405 --> 00:15:28,309
你觉得他配不上你妈
You don't think he's good enough for your mother.

277
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,644
不是的
It's not that.

278
00:15:29,645 --> 00:15:32,145
那是怎样
What then?

279
00:15:33,148 --> 00:15:36,028
我认为他配不上我妈
I don't think he's good enough for my mother.

280
00:15:37,611 --> 00:15:38,903
感觉好点了吗
Feel better?

281
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:42,740
我早就好了  刚才都是装的
I felt better hours ago. I've been totally milking it.

282
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:45,241
乖宝贝
That's my girl.

283
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:50,155
我能问你个问题吗
You know... Can I ask you a question?

284
00:15:54,878 --> 00:15:58,881
你跟那么多鬼魂对阵过了
You've been through a lot with this whole spirit game, right?

285
00:15:58,882 --> 00:16:00,091
你也是
We both have.

286
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:04,178
没错  但我从没见过哪个能让你不舒服
True enough. But I've never seen it make you sick before.

287
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:05,814
不必小题大做
Don't make it bigger than it is, you know.

288
00:16:05,815 --> 00:16:08,557
只不过这次失控了
I just can't get control of this one.

289
00:16:08,558 --> 00:16:11,186
我觉得  这不是好事
My point. It's a bad thing.

290
00:16:12,312 --> 00:16:15,189
你有没有想过  也许你能说
Look, do you ever think there'll be a day where you can say,

291
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:18,359
对不起  我帮不了你
you know, "Sorry. I can't help you.

292
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,777
你对我有害
"You're not good for me.

293
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:24,073
你让我不舒服  让我流泪
"You're making me sick. You're making me cry"?

294
00:16:24,074 --> 00:16:27,484
会有这么一天吗
Do you think that day will ever come?

295
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:30,286
我不知道  该有吗
I don't know. Should it?

296
00:16:35,251 --> 00:16:37,252
我去楼下倒杯水
I'm gonna go downstairs and get a glass of water.

297
00:16:37,253 --> 00:16:39,254
你要些什么
You want anything?

298
00:16:39,255 --> 00:16:41,048
智慧和耐心
Wisdom and patience.

299
00:16:41,049 --> 00:16:43,008
那可是抢手货
Always in short supply.

300
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:46,459
我就拿些椒盐饼干来吧
Saltine crackers are gonna have to do and those are for me.

301
00:17:04,197 --> 00:17:06,697
让他听
Make him listen.

302
00:17:07,492 --> 00:17:09,992
你是谁
Who are you?

303
00:17:10,495 --> 00:17:13,581
让他听
Make him listen!

304
00:17:13,664 --> 00:17:16,164
还有谁的声音
Who are the other voices?

305
00:17:22,757 --> 00:17:25,667
你在场  却什么也没做
You were there. You did nothing!

306
00:17:28,763 --> 00:17:31,263
我在等待
I'm waiting...

307
00:17:38,856 --> 00:17:41,066
怎么回事
What's going on?

308
00:17:42,318 --> 00:17:43,568
抱歉
I'm sorry.

309
00:17:43,569 --> 00:17:44,861
没事了  你还好吗
It's all right. You all right?

310
00:17:44,862 --> 00:17:48,907
-抱歉  -没事了  没事了
- I'm sorry. - It's all right. It's all right.

311
00:17:48,908 --> 00:17:51,408
拜托
Come on.

312
00:17:53,829 --> 00:17:56,329
回去  回去
Go back. Go back.

313
00:18:41,793 --> 00:18:43,586
你想告诉我什么
What are you trying to tell me?

314
00:18:43,587 --> 00:18:46,087
我的儿子
My son.

315
00:18:46,256 --> 00:18:48,756
我的儿子
My son.

316
00:18:52,304 --> 00:18:54,263
我的儿子
My son.

317
00:18:54,264 --> 00:18:57,644
他在哪里  你一定要告诉他
Where is he? You've got to tell him.

318
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,714
该死的  我忘记给你赔偿的支票了
Damn. I forgot to send the cheque for the car.

319
00:19:28,715 --> 00:19:30,132
我现在就开给你
You know, I can do that right now.

320
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:32,259
不用  保险公司赔了
No, no, no, no. The insurance company's taking care of it.

321
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,345
我只是顺路来看看柯克
I just wanted to come by and check on Kirk.

322
00:19:34,346 --> 00:19:35,554
柯克
Kirk.

323
00:19:35,555 --> 00:19:37,181
是的  看看他近况如何
Yeah. Just see how he's doing.

324
00:19:37,182 --> 00:19:39,850
你说过你们不会起诉他的
You said you weren't going to press charges.

325
00:19:39,851 --> 00:19:41,435
当然不会
Honestly, I'm not.

326
00:19:41,436 --> 00:19:43,520
我只想  和他谈谈
I just, I don't know, wanted to talk to him.

327
00:19:43,521 --> 00:19:46,440
安抚一下他的心情
You know, make sure there was no hard feelings.

328
00:19:46,441 --> 00:19:49,109
你是社工吗
Are you a social worker or something?

329
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:52,154
我做了不少公益  不过我不是
I get that a lot. Not really. No.

330
00:19:52,155 --> 00:19:54,907
那好  谢谢你的关心
Well, it's nice of you to take an interest.

331
00:19:54,908 --> 00:19:57,784
但是他不在这  再也不住这了
But he's not here. He's never here.

332
00:19:57,785 --> 00:19:58,952
他去哪里了
Where does he go?

333
00:19:58,953 --> 00:20:01,830
我也不清楚他去哪了
I'm not privy to that information any more.

334
00:20:01,831 --> 00:20:03,999
就你们二人吗
It's just the two of you?

335
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,167
什么
Excuse me?

336
00:20:05,168 --> 00:20:07,044
我只是好奇
Oh, I was just wondering.

337
00:20:07,045 --> 00:20:10,414
我妻子过世了  你是不是要问这个
My wife passed away, if that's what you're asking.

338
00:20:10,715 --> 00:20:13,258
我儿子一直是个好孩子
You know, my son was a good kid until then.

339
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:15,427
成绩优秀  生活幸福
Made good grades. He was happy.

340
00:20:15,428 --> 00:20:19,718
他母亲过世后  他就开始吸毒和惹事
When his mother passed away, he just spiralled.

341
00:20:20,058 --> 00:20:23,185
不久就沾上了毒品等恶习
All of a sudden, it was drugs and petty crime.

342
00:20:23,186 --> 00:20:25,353
他对谁都不说一句话
You know, he doesn't say a word, not to me or anyone else.

343
00:20:25,354 --> 00:20:27,355
相信我  我尽力了
And believe me, I try.

344
00:20:27,356 --> 00:20:28,565
我真的尽力了
I really try.

345
00:20:28,566 --> 00:20:29,774
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

346
00:20:29,775 --> 00:20:31,151
算了  我要赶飞机了
Anyway, I got to catch a plane.

347
00:20:31,152 --> 00:20:33,069
好吧
Right.

348
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,363
对不起  请留步
Hey, I'm sorry to hold you up.

349
00:20:35,364 --> 00:20:36,615
我能留张名片吗
Can I just leave a card?

350
00:20:36,616 --> 00:20:38,366
万一他想找人谈谈呢
You know, just in case he does wanna talk.

351
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:40,911
你是社工  是吧
You are a social worker, aren't you?

352
00:20:40,912 --> 00:20:42,412
也许你说对了
Maybe you're right.

353
00:20:42,413 --> 00:20:46,958
行  他确定我走后也许会回家的
Go ahead. He'll probably come home when he's sure I'm gone.

354
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:49,377
抱歉
Excuse me.

355
00:20:49,378 --> 00:20:51,878
她母亲是怎么死的
How did his mother die?

356
00:20:52,923 --> 00:20:56,863
是场意外  她死在了树林里
It was an accident. She died in the woods.

357
00:21:06,604 --> 00:21:09,104
去找红...
Find the red...

358
00:21:09,565 --> 00:21:11,691
去找红手套
Find the red glove.

359
00:21:11,692 --> 00:21:15,321
红手套
Red glove.

360
00:21:15,404 --> 00:21:18,115
去找红手套
Find the red glove.

361
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,116
红手套
Red glove.

362
00:21:20,117 --> 00:21:22,617
红手套
Red glove.

363
00:21:42,688 --> 00:21:44,189
-比利  -吉米
- Billy. - Hey, Jimmy.

364
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,899
你来培训的吗
Doing a training thing here or something?

365
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,776
-不  能跟你谈谈吗  -行  边走边说
- No. Actually, can I talk to you? - Yeah, sure, come on.

366
00:21:47,777 --> 00:21:50,528
你不是想拿我练海姆立克急救法吧
You're not gonna try to Heimlich me or something, are you?

367
00:21:50,529 --> 00:21:52,363
算你运气好  放过你
Maybe if you're lucky, next time.

368
00:21:52,364 --> 00:21:53,573
什么事  兄弟
What you need, baby?

369
00:21:53,574 --> 00:21:56,659
听着  我是无事不登三宝殿
Look, I wouldn't ask you this if I wasn't...

370
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,911
怎么了
What?

371
00:21:57,912 --> 00:22:01,122
我妈跟一个男人在约会
Well, my mom started seeing this guy.

372
00:22:01,123 --> 00:22:03,207
不知为何  我总觉得他怪怪的
And I don't know. Just got a weird feeling about him.

373
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:04,417
怎么个怪法
Weird how?

374
00:22:04,418 --> 00:22:05,668
说不上来  比利
I don't know, Billy.

375
00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:07,503
我想让你帮我查查他的底细
I was just wondering if you could run a check on him.

376
00:22:07,504 --> 00:22:08,755
他住在费城
He lives in Philadelphia.

377
00:22:08,756 --> 00:22:10,340
费城
Philadelphia.

378
00:22:10,341 --> 00:22:12,342
我不太清楚能查到些什么
I don't know what I can get from here.

379
00:22:12,343 --> 00:22:14,448
查查车管局  找找庭审记录
Maybe DMV. Maybe some court records.

380
00:22:14,448 --> 00:22:15,344
我碰碰运气吧
It'd be a shot in the dark.

381
00:22:15,345 --> 00:22:16,929
无论结果怎样  感激不尽
I'd appreciate anything you could do.

382
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,139
好吧  那么...
Okay, well...

383
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,434
你们怎么了  减薪了吗
What's wrong with you guys? Cutbacks?

384
00:22:21,435 --> 00:22:24,585
-他叫什么  -埃利斯·康威
- What's his name? - Ellis Conway.

385
00:22:25,105 --> 00:22:28,125
是个电工  费城人
He's an electrician. Philadelphia.

386
00:22:29,443 --> 00:22:33,196
有意思  他总对挚友的男朋友疑神疑鬼
Oh, it is so cute. He's all twitchy about Faith's boyfriend.

387
00:22:33,197 --> 00:22:34,488
谢谢
Thank you.

388
00:22:34,489 --> 00:22:35,823
但他看上去人不错啊
He seems like such a nice guy.

389
00:22:35,824 --> 00:22:37,658
没错  他的确如此
Oh, he is. He really is.

390
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:38,951
但她可是吉姆的妈妈
But, you know, it's Jim's mom,

391
00:22:38,952 --> 00:22:41,037
他一定会替她把关的
And he's always gonna look after her.

392
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:42,455
毕竟她有点感情用事
She's a little impulsive.

393
00:22:42,456 --> 00:22:45,656
真好  我喜欢感情用事的人
Oh, that's great. I love impulsive.

394
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,600
喂  等等
Hey! Stop!

395
00:23:07,355 --> 00:23:08,255
你好
Hi.

396
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,400
我能帮你

397
00:23:13,361 --> 00:23:15,861
你能让这声音消失吗
Can you make this stop?

398
00:23:18,366 --> 00:23:20,367
红手套
Red glove.

399
00:23:20,368 --> 00:23:22,868
红手套
Red glove.

400
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:26,090
红手套
Red glove.

401
00:23:26,191 --> 00:23:27,983
你觉得是谁的声音
Who do you think it is?

402
00:23:27,984 --> 00:23:30,986
不管是谁  我只想让它消失
I don't care who it is. I just want it to stop.

403
00:23:30,987 --> 00:23:33,547
是你妈妈  对吧
It's your mother, isn't it?

404
00:23:36,409 --> 00:23:37,951
你妈妈是干什么的
What did your mother do?

405
00:23:37,952 --> 00:23:41,205
她是电气工程师  设计电路板
She was an electrical engineer. Designed circuit boards.

406
00:23:41,206 --> 00:23:42,706
那又能说明什么
What difference does that make?

407
00:23:42,707 --> 00:23:45,459
说明她非常精通电子
So she knew a lot about electronics.

408
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,668
应该吧
I guess.

409
00:23:46,669 --> 00:23:49,254
灵魂摄取人的能量才能表达意愿
Spirits need our energy to manifest.

410
00:23:49,255 --> 00:23:50,250
她死在树林里
She's out in the woods.

411
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,757
那里没有她可利用的能量
There's no one there for her to draw on.

412
00:23:51,758 --> 00:23:52,800
于是她就试图利用
She's probably trying to communicate

413
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,386
唯一熟悉的东西进行交流
On the only thing that's familiar.

414
00:23:56,387 --> 00:23:57,971
你怎么知道这些
How do you know all this?

415
00:23:57,972 --> 00:24:01,672
我有这本事  能跟灵魂打交道
It's what I do. The spirit part, anyway.

416
00:24:01,726 --> 00:24:04,144
我觉得你妈妈想向你传达某种讯息
Look, I think your mother's trying to get a message to you.

417
00:24:04,145 --> 00:24:05,604
她在树林里等着你
And she's there. She's waiting for you.

418
00:24:05,605 --> 00:24:07,230
我不想听她的任何讯息
I don't want any messages from her.

419
00:24:07,231 --> 00:24:10,111
我只想让这声音消失
I just want the voices to stop.

420
00:24:10,485 --> 00:24:12,904
你说能帮助我  帮我啊
You said you could help me, so do it.

421
00:24:13,905 --> 00:24:17,555
你知道红手套的事吗
Do you know anything about a red glove?

422
00:24:22,622 --> 00:24:24,873
我妈妈是个骗子
My mother's a liar.

423
00:24:24,874 --> 00:24:29,844
无论她是生是死  都跟我毫不相干
I don't want anything to do with her, living or dead.

424
00:24:53,944 --> 00:24:57,224
当时在树林里到底发生了什么
What happened to you in these woods?

425
00:25:00,534 --> 00:25:03,788
那天  秋高气爽  风和日丽
An autumn day. Beautiful sun.

426
00:25:05,706 --> 00:25:09,585
一切都如此舒适  如此惬意
Everything felt so good, so right.

427
00:25:11,462 --> 00:25:14,342
我仿佛重回少女时代  自由自在
Free. I felt like a girl again.

428
00:25:15,174 --> 00:25:17,258
他为我带来了这一切
He did that for me.

429
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:19,759
我们已相识多年
We met years ago.

430
00:25:19,762 --> 00:25:21,888
我们当时只是好友
We were friends, that's all.

431
00:25:21,889 --> 00:25:24,494
但我的婚姻冷若冰霜
But my marriage was so cold,

432
00:25:24,494 --> 00:25:27,099
是鲍勃让我有了爱的感觉
And Bob made me feel loved.

433
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,520
我轻轻地摔了一跤
It was just a little fall.

434
00:25:31,774 --> 00:25:34,274
一点都不疼
Didn't hurt.

435
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:50,580
坑里有一条裸露的输电线
There was a broken power line at the bottom of the well.

436
00:25:50,626 --> 00:25:52,043
我触电了
I had been electrocuted.

437
00:25:52,044 --> 00:25:53,252
莱西
Lacy!

438
00:25:53,253 --> 00:25:56,339
我还来不及求救就已死了
I was dead before I could even yell or shout out.

439
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,840
救命  救命
Help! Help!

440
00:25:59,092 --> 00:26:01,592
我该如何解释
How could I explain?

441
00:26:03,305 --> 00:26:07,475
我儿子柯克信任我  他永远不会理解的
My son Kirk trusted me. He would never understand.

442
00:26:07,476 --> 00:26:09,976
后来消息就传开了
That's when everybody knew.

443
00:26:10,145 --> 00:26:13,272
-什么消息  -我们是情人
- Knew what? - That we were lovers.

444
00:26:13,273 --> 00:26:15,316
我们有婚外情
We were having an affair.

445
00:26:15,317 --> 00:26:17,151
我的家庭土崩瓦解 
My family was devastated.

446
00:26:17,151 --> 00:26:18,986
每个人都无法容忍我的背叛
And everyone felt betrayed.

447
00:26:18,987 --> 00:26:21,906
连我儿子柯克也对我丧失了信任
Even my son Kirk lost faith in me.

448
00:26:21,907 --> 00:26:23,574
他很愤怒
He was so angry.

449
00:26:23,575 --> 00:26:25,576
他开始荒废自己的天分
He started wasting his talent.

450
00:26:25,577 --> 00:26:26,785
他的父亲呢
What about his father?

451
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:28,537
迈尔斯根本不理解
Miles doesn't understand.

452
00:26:28,538 --> 00:26:29,955
不理解什么
Doesn't understand what?

453
00:26:29,956 --> 00:26:33,446
红手套  他根本不知道...
The red glove. He doesn't know that...

454
00:26:37,547 --> 00:26:40,047
红手套
Red glove.

455
00:26:46,455 --> 00:26:48,706
你好  这里是詹森家  请留言
Hi. This is the Jensens. Leave us a message.

456
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:50,416
你好  柯克  还是我梅林达·戈登
Hey, Kirk, it's Melinda Gordon again.

457
00:26:50,417 --> 00:26:52,300
我想和你谈谈  五分钟就好
If I could just talk to you for, like, five minutes.

458
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,419
真的很重要
It's really important.

459
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,005
请回电到我店里或打我手机
If you could just call my store or my cell.

460
00:26:56,006 --> 00:26:58,506
谢谢
Thank you.

461
00:26:58,675 --> 00:27:00,760
你还好吧  看上去很焦虑
Hey. Are you okay? You look worried.

462
00:27:00,761 --> 00:27:03,012
对  我已经习惯这种焦虑了
Yeah. I guess I'm always worried about something.

463
00:27:03,013 --> 00:27:06,599
你切这些  其它的交给我
Here. You chop these, and I will take care of the rest.

464
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,352
真有趣  我从未回家吃过午饭
This is fun. You know, I never come home for lunch.

465
00:27:09,353 --> 00:27:11,145
总算知道吉姆为何厨艺精湛了
Now I know why Jim's such a good cook.

466
00:27:11,146 --> 00:27:12,551
跟你说实话吧
To tell you the truth,

467
00:27:12,551 --> 00:27:14,607
反而是我从他身上学到的更多
I learnt more from him than he did from me.

468
00:27:14,608 --> 00:27:17,902
他对烹饪一直有着浓厚的兴趣
He has always been interested in food.

469
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:21,405
希望他至少能给埃利斯留点面包屑
Let's hope he gives poor Ellis a few crumbs at least.

470
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:23,282
你为此而困扰吗
Does it bother you?

471
00:27:23,283 --> 00:27:24,909
我料到他会如此
It's what I expected, pretty much.

472
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:26,535
他的保护欲很强
He's very protective.

473
00:27:26,536 --> 00:27:29,163
但他会想通的  埃利斯能征服所有人
But he'll come round. Ellis can win anybody over.

474
00:27:29,164 --> 00:27:31,436
不得不承认
You know, I have to admit.

475
00:27:31,436 --> 00:27:33,709
我羡慕你和吉姆的母子情
I envy what you and Jim have.

476
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:34,877
真希望我和我母亲...
I wish that my mother and I...

477
00:27:34,878 --> 00:27:37,788
千万别这么说
Whoa. Careful what you wish for.

478
00:27:37,881 --> 00:27:42,141
不容易啊  特别是他的成长期
It's not easy, especially the growing-up part.

479
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,886
我都记不清有多少次
I can't even count the number of times

480
00:27:43,887 --> 00:27:46,013
我们互相大发雷霆
We were furious with each other.

481
00:27:46,014 --> 00:27:47,236
现在也会
Still happens.

482
00:27:47,236 --> 00:27:50,059
但他知道  有个人永远支持他
But he always knew someone had his back.

483
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,546
有个人永远都理解他
He always knew someone was out there who understood him.

484
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:56,294
你和吉姆母子情深
Well, you and Jim have quite a bond.

485
00:27:56,294 --> 00:27:57,341
永远不会改变
Nothing's gonna change that.

486
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:02,972
得让他明白埃利斯没想改变这点
Now we just have to make him see that Ellis isn't trying to.

487
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:11,689
真迅速
That was fast.

488
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,649
如果是我妈妈  我也会很快
Hey, if it was my mom's, I'd be fast too, now.

489
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,776
-我请你喝咖啡  -不不不  我还有事
- Can I get you a coffee? - No, no, no. Look, I got to run.

490
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:18,245
-好吧  查到多少  -很多  看起来不妙
- All right, what do you got? - Plenty, and it isn't good.

491
00:28:18,246 --> 00:28:20,280
还有什么需要  尽管给我打电话
Look, you call me later if there's anything else you want me to do.

492
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:23,041
-谢谢  比利  欠你个人情  -小意思
- All right, Billy, thanks. I owe you one. - Hey, no problem.

493
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,737
儿子
Son.

494
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:14,502
我爱你
I love you.

495
00:29:35,439 --> 00:29:38,609
求你了  别再折磨自己
Please, stop hurting yourself.

496
00:29:45,699 --> 00:29:47,033
妈妈
Mom.

497
00:29:47,034 --> 00:29:49,684
求你了  别再折磨自己
Please, stop hurting yourself.

498
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,472
-我爱你  -妈妈
- I love you. - Mom!

499
00:29:52,473 --> 00:29:54,973
求你了  别
Please! No!

500
00:30:04,485 --> 00:30:06,319
-又是你  -柯克在吗
- You again? - Is Kirk here?

501
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,237
你可真会挑时间
You have amazing timing, I'll give you that.

502
00:30:08,238 --> 00:30:09,363
怎么了
What's wrong?

503
00:30:09,364 --> 00:30:11,783
欢迎来看我儿子最新的犯罪闹剧
Welcome to my son's latest crime spree.

504
00:30:11,784 --> 00:30:13,409
他刚闯入了一家电器商店
He just broke into an electronics store

505
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:14,952
把那里弄得翻天覆地
and trashed the place or something.

506
00:30:14,953 --> 00:30:16,496
我能帮上什么忙吗
Oh, is there anything I can do?

507
00:30:16,497 --> 00:30:20,541
他像是专挑我最忙的时候
You know, it's almost like he waits until he knows I'm at my busiest

508
00:30:20,542 --> 00:30:21,834
才来给我惹祸
before he pulls this crap.

509
00:30:21,835 --> 00:30:24,545
我认为这与你无关  詹森先生
I doubt that it has anything to do with you, Mr. Jensen.

510
00:30:24,546 --> 00:30:27,632
那你告诉我  这事关系什么
Well, please, tell me, what is it about?

511
00:30:27,633 --> 00:30:29,926
他因丧母而伤心欲绝
He's grieving. He lost his mother.

512
00:30:29,927 --> 00:30:34,889
我也丧妻了  那可谓釜底抽薪啊
I lost,too.Talk about having the rug pulled out from underneath you.

513
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:36,307
我已竭尽全力养育那孩子
You know, I've done my best for that kid.

514
00:30:36,308 --> 00:30:38,309
我教他做男子汉  要坚强
I taught him to be tough, with a thick skin.

515
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:40,227
不然如何在这世上生存
How else can you survive in this worid?

516
00:30:40,228 --> 00:30:44,998
他倒好  就会用垃圾桶砸店铺窗户
Instead he throws garbage cans through store windows.

517
00:30:47,402 --> 00:30:50,682
詹森  你家门
Oh, Mr. Jensen, you left your door...

518
00:30:51,531 --> 00:30:54,031
没关
...open.

519
00:30:56,912 --> 00:31:00,624
就在这里  过来
Right here. Come.

520
00:31:24,939 --> 00:31:27,439
找出来
Find it.

521
00:31:29,152 --> 00:31:31,652
在这里找
Find it here.

522
00:31:46,377 --> 00:31:48,503
红手套
Red glove.

523
00:31:48,504 --> 00:31:51,841
应该就在下面
Underneath, where it should be.

524
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:54,551
床垫
Mattress.

525
00:31:54,552 --> 00:31:57,052
红手套  找出来
Red glove, find it.

526
00:32:07,552 --> 00:32:09,352
《红手套》  作者:柯克·詹森

527
00:32:21,329 --> 00:32:23,874
抱歉  我能和我儿子单独谈谈吗
Excuse me, can I have a moment? It's my son.

528
00:32:24,174 --> 00:32:26,219
谢谢
Thanks.

529
00:32:27,001 --> 00:32:30,628
你为什么这么做  你昏头啦
Why are you doing this? I mean, is it that bad?

530
00:32:30,629 --> 00:32:33,381
我说过  再惹事就送你去看心理医生
I told you I'd send you to a psychiatrist or a counsellor.

531
00:32:33,382 --> 00:32:34,966
也许你真对谁敞开过心扉
Maybe if you actually talked to somebody.

532
00:32:34,967 --> 00:32:36,484
可你不能再这样堕落了
But you can't keep doing this.

533
00:32:36,485 --> 00:32:39,971
那你找个人来让我敞开心扉啊
Well, you let me know when you find me somebody to talk to.

534
00:32:39,972 --> 00:32:42,472
好了  孩子  跟我走
All right, son, let's go.

535
00:32:56,238 --> 00:32:58,738
谢谢
Thank you.

536
00:33:02,344 --> 00:33:03,594
你来这里干什么
What are you doing here?

537
00:33:03,595 --> 00:33:05,638
他们说没人保释你
They told me no one's bailed you out.

538
00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:08,599
对  他要给我教训
Yeah. He's teaching me a lesson.

539
00:33:09,685 --> 00:33:12,311
只有在美景镇监狱受会儿罪
Nothing like doing some hard time in the Grandview jail

540
00:33:12,312 --> 00:33:13,855
才能让浪子回头
to turn a guy around.

541
00:33:13,856 --> 00:33:15,106
抱歉
I'm sorry.

542
00:33:15,107 --> 00:33:17,692
没关系  至少我能安心睡一晚
It's fine. At least I'll get a good night's sleep.

543
00:33:17,693 --> 00:33:19,694
他们这里不让用电
They don't allow anything electronic in here.

544
00:33:19,695 --> 00:33:23,072
我知道母亲的遭遇了
I know what happened with your mother.

545
00:33:23,073 --> 00:33:24,198
你怎么知道
How?

546
00:33:24,199 --> 00:33:26,492
她告诉我的
She told me.

547
00:33:26,493 --> 00:33:27,868
对  好  随便
Yeah, okay. Whatever.

548
00:33:27,869 --> 00:33:31,119
她知道你对她很生气
She knows how angry you are at her.

549
00:33:32,374 --> 00:33:33,499
我不信
I doubt it.

550
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,168
是人都会犯错  她为此内疚不已
People make mistakes. She feels badly.

551
00:33:36,169 --> 00:33:39,214
她应得的  她骗了我
She should feel bad. She lied.

552
00:33:39,923 --> 00:33:41,799
我知道她为何要骗我爸
I know why she had to lie to my old man.

553
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,926
但为什么连我也要骗
But why did she have to lie to me?

554
00:33:43,927 --> 00:33:47,077
我对她毫无保留
I told her everything about myself.

555
00:33:49,933 --> 00:33:53,435
她不爱他  也许她也不爱我
She didn't love him. Well, maybe she didn't love me, either.

556
00:33:53,436 --> 00:33:55,479
你知道她爱你
You know that's not true.

557
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,316
有时他人的所做所为  我们无法理解
Look, sometimes we don't understand why people do what they do.

558
00:33:59,317 --> 00:34:02,337
每个人都有其苦衷
Everybody fights their own battle.

559
00:34:04,155 --> 00:34:07,325
而我们却不知道
We may not even know what that is.

560
00:34:12,622 --> 00:34:14,164
你从哪弄来的
Where the hell did you get this?

561
00:34:14,165 --> 00:34:16,665
她引导我找到的
She led me to it.

562
00:34:19,712 --> 00:34:21,213
你知道里面内容吗
You know what it's about?

563
00:34:21,214 --> 00:34:22,756
讲的是一个年轻人不知如何
It's about a young man who doesn't know

564
00:34:22,757 --> 00:34:25,217
开口告诉他爸  他是同性恋
how to tell his father that he's gay.

565
00:34:36,553 --> 00:34:38,888
别以为保释我出来就能弥补你的过错
Bailing me out doesn't make up for what you did.

566
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:40,181
对我而言可以弥补
Maybe to me it does.

567
00:34:40,182 --> 00:34:41,349
你无权阅读这份稿子
You had no right to read this.

568
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:43,935
写得很美  我都感动得哭了
It was beautiful. It made me cry.

569
00:34:43,936 --> 00:34:46,729
显然这是性情中人所写
And it was obviously written by somebody with a great heart.

570
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:48,106
你该继续写下去
You should keep writing.

571
00:34:48,107 --> 00:34:49,857
关你什么事
Look, it's none of your business.

572
00:34:49,858 --> 00:34:51,192
你算哪根葱
Who the hell are you anyway?

573
00:34:51,193 --> 00:34:52,860
为什么非得卷进这事
Why are you even involved with this?

574
00:34:52,861 --> 00:34:55,655
因为你偷的是我的车
Because it was my car you chose to steal.

575
00:34:55,656 --> 00:34:58,486
也许那是命中注定
And maybe that was no accident.

576
00:34:59,785 --> 00:35:01,577
你爸知道你写作吗
Does your father know that you write?

577
00:35:01,578 --> 00:35:03,120
你觉得呢
What do you think?

578
00:35:03,121 --> 00:35:05,498
为什么不告诉他
Well, why not?

579
00:35:05,499 --> 00:35:09,469
他不会理解  你也不会
He wouldn't understand, and neither do you.

580
00:35:11,213 --> 00:35:14,173
谢谢你保释我  钱我会还你
Look, thanks for the bail. I'll pay you back.

581
00:35:14,174 --> 00:35:15,716
谢谢你爸
Thank your father.

582
00:35:15,717 --> 00:35:18,844
是他许可我接你出来的
He was the one that gave me permission to pick you up.

583
00:35:18,845 --> 00:35:21,473
太好了  我该走了
Fantastic. I'm out of here.

584
00:35:31,483 --> 00:35:32,733
账单  先生
Check, sir.

585
00:35:32,734 --> 00:35:34,026
谢谢
Thank you.

586
00:35:34,027 --> 00:35:37,196
本以为这里的意大利菜不咋的
I was sure I wouldn't get any good Italian food out here.

587
00:35:37,197 --> 00:35:39,657
我错了  不用  我来付
I was wrong. No, I got it.

588
00:35:39,658 --> 00:35:43,178
你话不多  吉米  我欣赏你这点
You're a man of few words, Jimmy. I admire that.

589
00:35:44,788 --> 00:35:46,997
你做电工多久了  埃利斯
How long have you been an electrician, Ellis?

590
00:35:46,998 --> 00:35:48,374
电...
Electric...

591
00:35:48,375 --> 00:35:52,169
我干这行十四五年了
Well, I've been in the business a good 14, 15 years now.

592
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:55,130
真的吗  没有其它副业吗
Really? Ever done anything on the side?

593
00:35:55,131 --> 00:35:57,383
副业
On the side?

594
00:35:57,384 --> 00:35:59,218
我一天到晚忙不停
I keep myself busy enough.

595
00:35:59,219 --> 00:36:01,178
不见得
I bet you do.

596
00:36:01,179 --> 00:36:02,888
我没听懂你的意思
I don't think I get you.

597
00:36:02,889 --> 00:36:06,069
空头支票  网上诈骗
Writing bad cheques, Internet scams,

598
00:36:06,351 --> 00:36:08,685
电话欺诈
telephone fraud.

599
00:36:08,686 --> 00:36:12,105
我妈知道你在联邦监狱呆过两年吗
My mother know you spent two years in a federal prison?

600
00:36:12,106 --> 00:36:14,616
你查我  吉姆
You checking up on me, Jim?

601
00:36:14,692 --> 00:36:17,492
我是在查你  埃利斯
I'm checking up on you, Ellis.

602
00:36:18,321 --> 00:36:20,821
能让我看看吗
May I see that?

603
00:36:25,036 --> 00:36:26,203
就知道
Right.

604
00:36:26,204 --> 00:36:28,954
你看   问题出在这里
Well, you see, a problem here.

605
00:36:29,165 --> 00:36:32,167
我是叫埃利斯  但那是中间名
I go by "Ellis," but that's my middle name.

606
00:36:32,168 --> 00:36:34,878
我本名是  文森特·文尼·康威
My real name is Vincent Vinny Conway.

607
00:36:34,879 --> 00:36:38,298
你说的这个埃利斯·康威不是我
This here "Ellis Conway," that's somebody else.

608
00:36:38,299 --> 00:36:40,926
你可以让你的朋友
So, why don't you go back to your guy

609
00:36:40,927 --> 00:36:43,303
去查一下文森特·埃利斯·康威
And you give him the name "Vincent E. Conway,"

610
00:36:43,304 --> 00:36:45,639
看看他做过什么
See what he comes up with.

611
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:50,140
你知道吗  吉米  你妈妈给我提过醒
You know, Jimmy? Your mother warned me about you.

612
00:36:50,311 --> 00:36:52,811
等一下
Hey, wait a minute.

613
00:36:53,689 --> 00:36:55,774
这么说  你改名字了
What? So, what, did you change your name or something?

614
00:36:55,775 --> 00:36:57,763
我没改  只是扔了一个名
I didn't change it. I just dropped it.

615
00:36:57,763 --> 00:36:59,152
谢谢
Thank you.

616
00:36:59,153 --> 00:37:01,112
我刚开始工作时
Look, when I got my business started,

617
00:37:01,113 --> 00:37:05,700
我觉得埃利斯这名字能提高身价
I thought going by "Ellis" would make me sound more high-class.

618
00:37:05,701 --> 00:37:11,164
你知道的  有些人很在乎这个
You know how narrow-minded some people could be about these things.

619
00:37:11,165 --> 00:37:14,210
吉米  我理解你  是真的
Look, Jimmy, I understand. I do.

620
00:37:14,543 --> 00:37:16,628
我们都知道你妈妈非常好
Your mother's a wonderful woman. We both know that.

621
00:37:16,629 --> 00:37:21,309
但她的心受过伤  迷惘过  很容易再受伤
But she's been hurt, she's lost, she's vulnerable.

622
00:37:21,967 --> 00:37:25,053
你一直在照顾她  这也是我欣赏你的地方
You're looking out for her. That's something else I admire.

623
00:37:25,054 --> 00:37:27,931
埃利斯  我不知该如何向你抱歉
Ellis, I don't know where to begin to apologise.

624
00:37:27,932 --> 00:37:32,018
没关系  我自己也经历过很多事
Forget it, huh? I've been through a few things myself, you know.

625
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:36,147
生意时好时坏  妻子撒手人寰
Ups and downs in business. First wife passed away.

626
00:37:36,148 --> 00:37:39,150
每个人都有自己的苦痛  对吧  孩子
Yeah, we all have our wounds, kid. Right?

627
00:37:39,151 --> 00:37:42,987
我真想好好惩罚自己一下
Not as big as the one I'd like to inflict on myself right now.

628
00:37:42,988 --> 00:37:45,281
我是没受过好的教育
I may not be a college guy,

629
00:37:45,282 --> 00:37:49,192
但我做过不少正确的选择
But I've made some good moves in my time.

630
00:37:49,578 --> 00:37:52,413
遇见你妈妈就是其中之一
Meeting your mom was one of them.

631
00:37:52,414 --> 00:37:54,415
来点冰激凌吗
Hey, wanna go get some ice cream?

632
00:37:54,416 --> 00:37:55,750
我们去吃点冰激凌
I say we get some ice cream.

633
00:37:55,751 --> 00:37:58,837
走吧  去吃冰激凌  你请客
Then let's go get some ice cream. And you can pay.

634
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:03,457
难以置信  你竟然保释了那孩子
I can't believe it. I can't believe you bailed the kid out.

635
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:05,676
我怎能眼睁睁地看他蹲监狱
I couldn't just let him sit there in that cage.

636
00:38:05,677 --> 00:38:08,846
没花多少钱  你生气了吗
It didn't cost that much. Are you mad?

637
00:38:08,847 --> 00:38:11,347
生气  让我想想
Mad? Let me see.

638
00:38:12,601 --> 00:38:16,145
我自信爱你足够深了
Just when I think I can't possibly love you more,

639
00:38:16,146 --> 00:38:18,646
你却让我更爱你了
You prove me wrong.

640
00:38:18,857 --> 00:38:20,512
你能想象吗
Can you imagine

641
00:38:20,512 --> 00:38:21,567
要对一个本该无条件爱你的人
having to keep a secret like that from the one person

642
00:38:21,568 --> 00:38:24,028
隐藏这样一个秘密
who's supposed to love you no matter what?

643
00:38:24,029 --> 00:38:25,613
说到秘密...
Speaking of secrets...

644
00:38:25,614 --> 00:38:28,114
奥文顿大道415号
415  Ovington

645
00:38:31,161 --> 00:38:32,870
奥文顿大道415号
415  Ovington

646
00:38:32,871 --> 00:38:35,373
柯克
Kirk.

647
00:38:35,999 --> 00:38:37,374
我好想记得这地方
How do I know that address?

648
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:38,709
警察的报告
It was on the police report.

649
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:41,462
那孩子偷我们车所去的地方
That's where the kid took our car when he stole it.

650
00:38:41,463 --> 00:38:43,255
-你干吗  -当然是和你一起去
- What are you doing? - I'm coming with you. Are you kidding?

651
00:38:43,256 --> 00:38:45,758
大半夜我们同时出去  邻居会起疑的
We can't both leave in the middle of the night.It'll look weird.

652
00:38:45,759 --> 00:38:47,509
有事会给你打电话的
I'll call you if I need your help.

653
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,636
快点
Hurry!

654
00:38:48,637 --> 00:38:51,137
我不会有没事的
I'll be fine.

655
00:38:57,145 --> 00:38:58,520
你来这儿干什么
Hey, what are you doing here?

656
00:38:58,521 --> 00:38:59,980
这是他住的地方
This is his house.

657
00:38:59,981 --> 00:39:02,149
这才是我妈向往的地方
This is where my mother really wanted to be,

658
00:39:02,149 --> 00:39:03,317
陪她的情人
with her lover.

659
00:39:03,318 --> 00:39:05,277
别这样  跟我说说怎么回事
Come on. Don't do this. Just talk to me.

660
00:39:05,278 --> 00:39:08,030
别担心  他不住这里了
Don't worry. He doesn't live here any more.

661
00:39:08,031 --> 00:39:11,241
她的真爱  已经搬走了
The man my mother really loved, he moved away.

662
00:39:12,869 --> 00:39:15,959
她知道你有多生气
She knows how mad you are at her.

663
00:39:15,997 --> 00:39:17,873
她知道外遇这事伤你很深
She knows how much the affair hurt you.

664
00:39:17,874 --> 00:39:20,417
但不仅如此  对吗
But it's not just that, is it?

665
00:39:20,418 --> 00:39:23,921
她说你受的伤害超乎你的想象
She says you hurt even more than you know.

666
00:39:23,922 --> 00:39:27,675
是吗  超乎我的想象吗
Really? More hurt than even I know? Wow.

667
00:39:27,759 --> 00:39:29,384
真痛苦啊
That's a lot of hurt.

668
00:39:29,385 --> 00:39:31,219
你痛苦是因为只有她
And you hurt because she was the only one

669
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:36,040
能够理解你  支持你
Who could possibly understand you. She had your back.

670
00:39:40,563 --> 00:39:43,073
这不是她的错  对吗
It wasn't her fault, right?

671
00:39:43,649 --> 00:39:46,149
至少去世不是她的错
The dying part, at least.

672
00:39:48,029 --> 00:39:50,699
她希望你能节哀
She wanted you to have peace.

673
00:39:52,158 --> 00:39:54,284
她就像是我的地图
She was like my map, you know.

674
00:39:54,285 --> 00:39:55,744
只要我跟她说会儿话
She could always figure out where I was

675
00:39:55,745 --> 00:40:00,291
她就能知道我怎么了  要去干什么
Or where I wanted to go just by talking to her.

676
00:40:03,294 --> 00:40:06,094
甚至当我自认为是个另类时
Even when I felt like a freak,

677
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:10,592
她还能看着我  让我知道
She could look at me and I knew that

678
00:40:10,593 --> 00:40:14,723
不管怎样  都会没事的
Everything was gonna be okay, no matter what.

679
00:40:15,681 --> 00:40:18,181
我信任她
And I believed her.

680
00:40:21,187 --> 00:40:23,697
可我连跟她说再见的机会都没有
I never got to say goodbye.

681
00:40:29,862 --> 00:40:32,362
我能和她说说话吗
Can I talk to her?

682
00:40:32,698 --> 00:40:34,866
她就在这儿
She's here.

683
00:40:34,867 --> 00:40:39,417
你的爱给了她走出来的能量
She can feel your love. It's giving her strength.

684
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:45,625
我非常想你
I miss you so much.

685
00:40:46,545 --> 00:40:49,045
我感觉很迷茫
I feel so lost.

686
00:40:51,383 --> 00:40:54,552
现在谁来告诉我一切会好的
Who's gonna tell me that everything's gonna be okay now?

687
00:40:54,553 --> 00:40:57,598
-你自己  -那正是她所想看到的
- You will. - That's what she wants.

688
00:40:59,391 --> 00:41:02,101
你可以通过写小说把她留在你身边
You can keep her alive in everything that you write.

689
00:41:02,102 --> 00:41:04,437
我为你自豪
I'm so proud of him.

690
00:41:04,438 --> 00:41:08,649
她想告诉你  她为你自豪
And she wants you to know that she's proud of you.

691
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:11,319
告诉他对他爸爸好一点
Tell him to be kind to his father.

692
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:14,030
她说你爸爸是个好人
She's saying that your father's a good man.

693
00:41:14,031 --> 00:41:16,574
只是他不敢再付出感情
He's just afraid of his heart.

694
00:41:16,575 --> 00:41:19,702
他需要你告诉他如何去爱
And he needs to be taught how to love.

695
00:41:19,703 --> 00:41:21,829
这太难了
It's so hard.

696
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:24,330
我明白
I know.

697
00:41:24,374 --> 00:41:26,874
但值得一试
But it's worth it.

698
00:41:28,545 --> 00:41:31,045
谢谢你
Thanks.

699
00:41:33,342 --> 00:41:35,384
她在和你说再见
She's saying goodbye.

700
00:41:35,385 --> 00:41:36,844
这么快
So soon?

701
00:41:36,845 --> 00:41:39,345
时间到了
It's time.

702
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:50,439
再见  妈妈
Goodbye, Mom.

703
00:41:55,697 --> 00:41:58,197
你还好吧
Are you okay?

704
00:41:59,367 --> 00:42:01,867
没事  你呢
Yeah. You?

705
00:42:02,037 --> 00:42:04,706
没事  我很好
Yeah. Yeah, really okay.

706
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,980
头痛消失了  感觉好多了
No more headaches. I feel much better.

707
00:42:11,046 --> 00:42:13,546
只剩一件事没做
One more thing left to do.

708
00:42:14,257 --> 00:42:17,510
我做不到  我没勇气给他
I can't. I can't give it to him.

709
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:31,607
妈  我对埃利斯做了件很蠢的事
Mom, I did a pretty stupid thing. This is about Ellis.

710
00:42:32,308 --> 00:42:34,108
对  他跟你提过吗
Yeah. Did he mention it?

711
00:42:34,235 --> 00:42:36,735
没
No.

712
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:40,489
我跟他说了对不起
I apologised to him,

713
00:42:41,618 --> 00:42:43,994
我也想跟你说声对不起
And I'd like to apologise to you,

714
00:42:43,995 --> 00:42:48,832
埃利斯来的时候  我像个混蛋一样
Because I've been kind of a jerk when it comes to Ellis.

715
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:50,500
只是像吗
Kind of?

716
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:53,545
好吧  我就是  完全发挥到极致的混蛋
A total, complete, you don't even wanna know, kind of jerk.

717
00:42:53,546 --> 00:42:56,206
我要认为他应付不了  就不会带他来
I wouldn't have brought him if I thought he couldn't handle it.

718
00:42:56,207 --> 00:42:57,549
什么  你知道...
Wait, wait. You knew that I was...

719
00:42:57,550 --> 00:43:01,511
我的直觉告诉我  由着你们去
My instinct said just show up and let Ellis be Ellis and Jim be Jim,

720
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:04,062
你们会相处好的
And it'll all just sort itself out.

721
00:43:04,765 --> 00:43:08,025
也许你会后悔"由着我"的
I think you might regret the "let Jim be Jim" part.

722
00:43:11,939 --> 00:43:14,816
你知道我儿子在哪吗  我很担心他
Do you know where my son is? I'm worried about him. He hadn't...

723
00:43:14,817 --> 00:43:17,110
他很好
He's okay now.

724
00:43:17,111 --> 00:43:19,611
这是他给你的
This is for you.
