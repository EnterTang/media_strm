1
00:00:08,755 --> 00:00:10,420
我叫梅林达·戈登
My name is Melinda Gordon.

2
00:00:11,373 --> 00:00:13,959
我结了婚  住在一个小镇上
I'm married, I live in a small town,

3
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:16,816
经营一家古董店
and I own an antique shop.

4
00:00:16,841 --> 00:00:18,219
我也许和你相似
I might be just like you.

5
00:00:18,835 --> 00:00:20,830
但当我还是小姑娘时
Except that from the time I was a little girl,

6
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:22,464
我就能同亡者交流
I knew that I could talk to the dead.

7
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:24,191
没事的  亲爱的
It's all right, honey.

8
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,549
祖母称他们为地缚灵
Earthbound spirits, my grandmother called them.

9
00:00:27,811 --> 00:00:30,283
他们在人间滞留  因为他们有未了的心愿
They're stuck here because they have unfinished business with the living

10
00:00:30,318 --> 00:00:31,799
他们找我寻求帮助
and they come to me for help.

11
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:38,746
讲述我的故事  就是讲述他们的故事
In order to tell you my story, I have to tell you theirs.

12
00:00:49,052 --> 00:00:51,363
救救我
Help me.

13
00:00:51,363 --> 00:00:53,488
能救我出去吗
Can you get me out of here?

14
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:54,999
谁能听见我说话吗
Can anybody hear me?

15
00:00:54,999 --> 00:00:56,925
我能听到
I can hear you.

16
00:00:57,834 --> 00:01:00,181
我知道你的秘密
And I know your secret.

17
00:01:00,402 --> 00:01:02,015
什么秘密
What secret?

18
00:01:02,015 --> 00:01:05,925
童心不改的秘密
That you are seriously in touch with your inner child.

19
00:01:05,925 --> 00:01:08,238
怎么说呢  我很会找乐子
What can I say? Easily amused.

20
00:01:08,238 --> 00:01:09,863
我喜欢你这一点
No, I love that about you.

21
00:01:09,863 --> 00:01:12,925
套上大鞋子  红鼻头  我就可以扮小丑
You know, large shoes, big, red nose, and I'm all set.

22
00:01:12,925 --> 00:01:14,362
内德去哪了
Where did Ned go?

23
00:01:14,362 --> 00:01:15,800
胡迪尼[魔术大师]
Hey, Houdini.

24
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,425
出来露个面如何
How about making an appearance?

25
00:01:17,425 --> 00:01:18,925
你说过我不用留在这儿
You said I wouldn't have to stay.

26
00:01:18,925 --> 00:01:20,863
但我也说了
Yeah. I also said

27
00:01:20,863 --> 00:01:23,050
你得给我个合适的理由
That you would have to explain why.

28
00:01:23,238 --> 00:01:25,550
我得赶明天的数学作业  非常重要
I have a really important math project due tomorrow.

29
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:29,300
但我今天也很需要人帮忙
I was actually counting on another pair of hands today.

30
00:01:29,988 --> 00:01:30,862
这样吧
Will these do?

31
00:01:30,862 --> 00:01:32,363
我留下
I'll stay.

32
00:01:32,863 --> 00:01:34,300
希望你不介意
I hope you're not upset.

33
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,237
只要你愿意
As long as you're ok with it.

34
00:01:36,237 --> 00:01:37,988
棒极了  谢谢老妈  谢谢梅林达
Cool. thanks, mom. thanks, Melinda.

35
00:01:37,988 --> 00:01:41,613
要是他这次还只得个C
If he even cracks a "c" on this project,

36
00:01:41,613 --> 00:01:44,188
我就让他好看
I can live with getting a "c" on my parenting.

37
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,800
那么  我该做些什么
So, what do you need me to do?

38
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,175
关门  
Close up.

39
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:49,550
我们去采购
We're going shopping.

40
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:04,175
我在这儿住了20年
I lived at this place for the last 20 years

41
00:02:04,175 --> 00:02:05,999
从没想过要离开
I never thought I'd have to leave.

42
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:07,425
生意很差吗
Business is that slow?

43
00:02:07,425 --> 00:02:09,988
易趣网流行之后  就很惨淡了
Ever since ebay dead as a doornail.

44
00:02:09,988 --> 00:02:12,500
你也可以在网上卖啊
Well, you could sell your stuff online, too,

45
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,380
或者
Or,

46
00:02:14,438 --> 00:02:15,862
雇个人帮忙
Get somebody else to do it

47
00:02:15,862 --> 00:02:18,558
你就可以舒服地在家做生意了
and sell your stuff from the comfort of your own home.

48
00:02:18,558 --> 00:02:20,344
才不  我喜欢人多热闹
Nah. I'm too much of a people person.

49
00:02:20,344 --> 00:02:21,863
讨价还价多爽啊
I'd miss talking to folks.

50
00:02:21,863 --> 00:02:23,925
梅林达  过来看看这个
Melinda, you have to look at these.

51
00:02:23,925 --> 00:02:25,487
瞧见了吧
See what I mean?

52
00:02:27,627 --> 00:02:30,237
我好像没把这些摆出来
I didn't know that I had put those out.

53
00:02:30,237 --> 00:02:31,237
这些不卖吗
Are these not for sale?

54
00:02:31,237 --> 00:02:34,550
不不  卖  清仓处理
No. no, they're for sale. everything must go.

55
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,175
我知道你为何不愿离开它们了
I can understand why you wouldn't want to part with them.

56
00:02:37,175 --> 00:02:38,175
多漂亮
They're gorgeous.

57
00:02:38,175 --> 00:02:40,050
表面是手绘的
Handpainted on the front.

58
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,488
是圣诞节饰品吗
Are they christmas ornaments?

59
00:02:41,488 --> 00:02:43,050
只要你喜欢  什么节日都能用
Oh, well, could be,or whatever you like.

60
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:43,999
如果你不要
If you don't get these,

61
00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:45,487
那我就买了自己要
I'm gonna get them for the store myself.

62
00:02:45,487 --> 00:02:46,863
好吧  我买了
Ok, I'll take them.

63
00:02:47,363 --> 00:02:48,737
你眼光真好  迪莉娅
You have a good eye, Delia.

64
00:02:48,737 --> 00:02:50,363
要采购  欢迎随时找我
You can go shopping with me anytime you want.

65
00:02:50,363 --> 00:02:52,800
别后悔哦
Oh, you're gonna be sorry you said that.

66
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,500
鬼语者  第二季  第4集
自闭其中

67
00:03:55,741 --> 00:03:57,862
把它们摆哪里好
So where do you want me to put these?

68
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:00,019
不急着摆出来
Oh, we don't have to do that now.

69
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:00,988
你开玩笑吧
Are you kidding?

70
00:04:00,988 --> 00:04:02,878
卖出第一套房子后  我就再没这么兴奋过
I haven't been this jazzed since I sold my first house.

71
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:05,488
这感觉太怀旧了
Seems like a thousand years ago.

72
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:14,113
千万别告诉内德
And please don't tell Ned.

73
00:04:14,113 --> 00:04:16,363
我要他觉得  我替他给你帮忙
I want him to think that covering his hours

74
00:04:16,363 --> 00:04:18,363
是做出了天大的牺牲
Was a huge sacrifice for me.

75
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:35,093
这书架不太稳
You know what, I think this shelf isn't level.

76
00:04:35,093 --> 00:04:37,363
你该在这条腿下垫块木头
You wanna put a piece of wood right underneath this leg.

77
00:04:37,363 --> 00:04:38,050
也许
You know,

78
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,675
我们该暂时把饰品留在盒子里
Maybe we could just keep the ornament in the box for now.

79
00:04:40,675 --> 00:04:43,000
POP  购物的目的
P.O.P. "point of purchase. "

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,040
就是要摆在醒目之处
You always wanna put some out front

81
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,425
让所有人都看到
Where everyone can see them.

82
00:04:48,425 --> 00:04:50,425
我会考虑
I'll think about that.

83
00:04:50,425 --> 00:04:51,362
这就对了
That's the point.

84
00:04:51,362 --> 00:04:53,487
不要光想  买才重要
You don't wanna think. You just wanna buy.

85
00:04:53,487 --> 00:04:56,800
把它们收起来  好吗
Can you just put them back, please?

86
00:04:57,433 --> 00:04:58,535
当然
Sure.

87
00:04:58,535 --> 00:04:59,800
我不是那意思
I didn't mean to it.

88
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,275
只是有时  到了新货
It's just sometimes when I have new things,

89
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:03,237
我喜欢先收着
I like to hold off on putting them out

90
00:05:03,237 --> 00:05:04,924
直到有合适买主出现
Until I'm really sure where they're going.

91
00:05:04,924 --> 00:05:06,612
我理解
I understand.

92
00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:26,425
梅林达  真的很抱歉  
Melinda, I am so sorry.

93
00:05:26,425 --> 00:05:29,175
我有时太忘乎所以了
I just get carried away sometimes.

94
00:05:29,175 --> 00:05:32,824
我也很抱歉  我有点焦躁
Me, too. I guess I'm just a little on edge.

95
00:05:32,824 --> 00:05:34,984
我知道自己当老板不容易
I know it's not easy being your own boss.

96
00:05:34,984 --> 00:05:37,238
我过去也常想能有自己的地方
I used to think that I was gonna open up my own place,

97
00:05:37,238 --> 00:05:40,034
开一家这样的小店
Have a little store like this one.

98
00:05:40,034 --> 00:05:42,987
店名叫"迪莉娅饰品店"
I was either gonna call it Delia's decorations

99
00:05:42,987 --> 00:05:45,422
或"街边收藏馆"
Or the curbside curator.

100
00:05:45,422 --> 00:05:47,363
那为什么没呢
And why didn't you?

101
00:05:47,737 --> 00:05:49,613
我结婚了  生了内德
I got married, I had Ned,

102
00:05:49,613 --> 00:05:52,488
过去的想法
And then the concept of someday

103
00:05:52,488 --> 00:05:55,363
就变得不切实际了
Just becomes a little more abstract.

104
00:05:55,425 --> 00:05:58,175
你怎么会做房地产呢
Uh, how did you get into real estate?

105
00:05:58,675 --> 00:06:01,288
我丈夫过世之后
When my husband died.

106
00:06:01,288 --> 00:06:03,863
我不得不赶紧改变计划
I had to think of a plan "b" in a hurry.

107
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,300
因为小生意来钱太慢
There's no time to grow a small business.

108
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,800
我必须出去赚钱回来  所以
I had to get out there and make some money, so

109
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,175
我取得了地产执照
Got my real estate license.

110
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,175
你能买些报纸来吗
Could you grab some newspapers

111
00:06:12,175 --> 00:06:15,050
或者看看房地产广告
And maybe check for estate sales?

112
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,988
当然  没问题
Sure. No problem.

113
00:06:16,999 --> 00:06:19,988
越快越好  以免售罄
As soon as you can, before they run out.

114
00:06:20,495 --> 00:06:22,487
要我顺路给你带些什么吗
On my way, want anything else?

115
00:06:22,487 --> 00:06:23,588
不用  谢谢  
No. Thanks.

116
00:06:23,588 --> 00:06:24,988
好的
Ok.

117
00:06:45,513 --> 00:06:46,800
你是谁
Who are you?

118
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:51,613
你怎么了
What's going on?

119
00:06:52,473 --> 00:06:54,531
发生什么事了
What's happening?

120
00:06:54,531 --> 00:06:57,090
告诉我  我可以帮你
Talk to me. I can help.

121
00:06:58,475 --> 00:07:00,339
住手
Stop it.

122
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:02,003
别这样
Don't do that.

123
00:07:02,003 --> 00:07:04,925
快停下
Just please stop it.

124
00:07:10,384 --> 00:07:11,988
求你
Please.

125
00:07:12,002 --> 00:07:13,362
住手
Stop it!

126
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,838
住手
Stop!

127
00:07:14,838 --> 00:07:16,237
求你了
Please.

128
00:07:35,042 --> 00:07:37,175
你能看见我吗
Can you see me?

129
00:07:55,546 --> 00:07:58,108
这么说你能看见他  听到他
So you can see and hear this ghost,

130
00:07:58,108 --> 00:08:00,050
但他却看不见  也听不到你
But he can't see or hear you?

131
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,999
是啊  太悲哀了
Yeah. How's that for a cruel twist of fate?

132
00:08:02,499 --> 00:08:04,425
也许他又聋又瞎
Maybe this ghost is deaf and blind.

133
00:08:04,425 --> 00:08:06,863
他好像被困住了
It's like he's trapped here,

134
00:08:06,863 --> 00:08:09,300
受那些圣诞饰品的折磨
Being tormented by these christmas ornaments.

135
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,047
不是每个人都喜欢节日
Not everybody likes the holidays.

136
00:08:11,047 --> 00:08:12,675
他一定想摆脱它们
He's definitely trying to get rid of them.

137
00:08:12,675 --> 00:08:14,675
它们仿佛有生命  能呼吸似的
It's like they're alive, breathing.

138
00:08:14,675 --> 00:08:16,425
我从见过这种情形
I've never seen anything like it.

139
00:08:16,847 --> 00:08:18,925
东西在哪儿
Where are they now?

140
00:08:21,248 --> 00:08:23,399
我还以为被你藏起来了
Well, I was hoping the answer was hidden,

141
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:25,925
比如在店里某个隐蔽的角落
You know, deeply away somewhere in the store.

142
00:08:27,777 --> 00:08:28,984
真漂亮 
Well, they're pretty.

143
00:08:28,984 --> 00:08:31,197
真希望你也能看见
I wish you could see this.

144
00:08:38,113 --> 00:08:39,999
我想抱你
Let me hold you.

145
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:41,487
我能碰你吗 
Can't I touch you?

146
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:43,113
不
No!

147
00:08:43,113 --> 00:08:44,300
住手
Stop it!

148
00:08:44,555 --> 00:08:46,596
别管我
Leave me alone!

149
00:08:49,637 --> 00:08:50,753
撑住
Come on.

150
00:08:51,006 --> 00:08:51,999
保持呼吸
Keep breathing.

151
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:53,362
站好了  没事了
Stand up. You're all right.

152
00:08:53,362 --> 00:08:54,800
刚才怎么了
What happened?

153
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,738
我还想问你呢  你刚才晕了
You tell me.you just blacked out there for a while.

154
00:08:57,738 --> 00:09:01,613
我感到很害怕  又很愤怒
I felt scared and really angry.

155
00:09:01,613 --> 00:09:03,000
让我难以承受
It was overwhelming.

156
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,999
坐下休息会儿
Maybe you should sit down.

157
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,925
不  不行  我想出去走走
No, I don't think I can. I should walk it off.

158
00:09:08,563 --> 00:09:10,050
你看到东西了
Did you see anything?

159
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,675
是的  有两个人在打架
Yeah, I did. 2 people hitting each other

160
00:09:12,675 --> 00:09:14,488
有什么冲突
And some kind of fight.

161
00:09:26,214 --> 00:09:29,113
好吧  得弄走这个鬼魂
Ok, I want this ghost out of here.

162
00:09:37,084 --> 00:09:39,603
如果他想毁了这些饰品
If the ghost wants to destroy these ornaments,

163
00:09:39,603 --> 00:09:41,175
又不能自己解决
He can't do it himself,

164
00:09:41,175 --> 00:09:44,524
火烧是毁掉木制品的最好方法
Fire is the best way that I know to destroy something made of wood.

165
00:09:44,524 --> 00:09:46,300
我替他完成  他就能超度了
If I do it for him, he can cross over.

166
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,124
他走了吗
Is he gone?

167
00:10:08,972 --> 00:10:10,273
是的
Yes.

168
00:10:10,273 --> 00:10:11,285
好吧
All right.

169
00:10:11,285 --> 00:10:14,298
进屋吧
Come on.

170
00:10:17,176 --> 00:10:18,737
我饿死了
Oh, I am so hungry.

171
00:10:24,384 --> 00:10:26,050
它们又回来了
They're back.

172
00:10:40,835 --> 00:10:42,988
还有他
So is he.

173
00:11:02,243 --> 00:11:04,282
佩恩教授
Professor Payne?

174
00:11:06,737 --> 00:11:08,300
佩恩教授  
Professor Payne.

175
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,425
走开
Go away!

176
00:11:09,425 --> 00:11:12,050
我改主意了  今天不接待学生
I changed my mind! No student office hours today!

177
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,363
我不是学生
I'm not a student.

178
00:11:13,363 --> 00:11:15,488
我是梅林达·戈登  你之前帮过我
It's Melinda Gordon. You helped me before.

179
00:11:15,722 --> 00:11:17,863
我该提醒自己
Note to self

180
00:11:17,863 --> 00:11:19,300
别再帮人
Stop helping people.

181
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,343
你在找什么
What are you looking for?

182
00:11:21,343 --> 00:11:22,925
在撞到头之前  我正在找午餐
Well, before I hit my head, I was looking for my lunch.

183
00:11:22,925 --> 00:11:24,821
应该在一个纸袋里
It's in a paper bag.

184
00:11:24,821 --> 00:11:27,113
自带午餐  这不像你啊
Brown bagging lunch. That doesn't sound like you.

185
00:11:27,113 --> 00:11:29,738
戈登女士  好吧
Ms. Gordon. All right.

186
00:11:29,738 --> 00:11:30,925
你又找我什么事
What do you have for me, huh?

187
00:11:30,925 --> 00:11:32,175
一堆你已经知道答案的
Bunch of ambiguous questions that

188
00:11:32,175 --> 00:11:33,863
模棱两可的问题
You probably already know the answers to?

189
00:11:33,863 --> 00:11:34,925
过奖了
You give me too much credit.

190
00:11:34,925 --> 00:11:37,112
哪里  岂止
Maybe not enough credit. hmm?

191
00:11:37,112 --> 00:11:39,488
在你的研究中  有遇到过
In your studies, have you ever come across a situation

192
00:11:39,488 --> 00:11:42,050
鬼魂能变出某件实体的情况吗
Where a spirit can make an object appear in our world?

193
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,737
物质化  
Materialization?

194
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:45,362
也许吧  但我是指
I guess. what I'm talking about is

195
00:11:45,362 --> 00:11:47,425
那样东西  不仅鬼魂能看到并碰触到
An object that the spirit can see and touch and that

196
00:11:47,425 --> 00:11:48,863
我们也能
We can see and touch, too.

197
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,863
希望是珠宝或钞票
Let's hope it's jewelry and cash then, huh?

198
00:11:50,863 --> 00:11:52,362
有或没有
Yes or no?

199
00:11:52,934 --> 00:11:55,488
我听说过  但我不信
Look, I've heard of it, but I don't believe it.

200
00:11:55,488 --> 00:11:56,300
为什么
And why not?

201
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,800
因为我不信鬼魂之说
Because I don't believe in ghosts!

202
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,800
你怎能研究这个  却又不信它呢
How can you study this stuff and not believe in it?

203
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,613
我不研究鬼怪  戈登小姐
I don't study the stuff, Ms. Gordon.

204
00:12:02,613 --> 00:12:06,239
我研究的是产生信仰的根源
I study people's need to believe in the stuff,

205
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:07,863
就像我面前的你
People like you standing in front of me,

206
00:12:07,863 --> 00:12:09,461
看上去
Looking

207
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:10,613
秀色可餐
Looking beautiful.

208
00:12:10,613 --> 00:12:12,175
香水味芬芳诱人
And smelling delicious is what that perfume,

209
00:12:12,175 --> 00:12:13,737
是法国货吗
Is that french?

210
00:12:13,737 --> 00:12:14,738
让我闻闻
Let me smell it.

211
00:12:14,738 --> 00:12:17,175
好吧  我们假设一下
Ok, let's just assume for a minute

212
00:12:17,175 --> 00:12:20,088
鬼魂真实存在  并能移动物体
That spirits exist and they can move objects.

213
00:12:20,088 --> 00:12:22,113
这叫"幻象"
Yeah. They called apports.

214
00:12:22,113 --> 00:12:24,316
源自法语"Apporter"  表示"带来"
It's from the french word apporter. It means "to bring. "

215
00:12:24,316 --> 00:12:25,550
带来什么
Bring what?

216
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,503
比香水厉害多了
More of that perfume you're wearing,

217
00:12:26,503 --> 00:12:29,416
老实说  这味儿让人兴奋
'cause seriously, it's making me bananas.

218
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,862
开玩笑呢  也许是真的
I'm kidding. Unless I'm not.

219
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:35,852
好吧  开玩笑的
Ok, I'm kidding.

220
00:12:35,852 --> 00:12:36,925
带来"透彻"
Um, it brings clarity,

221
00:12:36,925 --> 00:12:39,197
深究其意  脱离字面
Deeper understanding, aside from the literal,

222
00:12:39,197 --> 00:12:41,241
有种解释说  "幻象"是
You know, interpretation that an apport is

223
00:12:41,241 --> 00:12:43,286
亡灵向活人传达其意
Sent from beyond to the living,

224
00:12:43,286 --> 00:12:46,635
也许是要揭示非常重要的事情
Maybe it's a manifestation of something that's so important,

225
00:12:46,635 --> 00:12:47,800
具有很强的象征性
You know, something really symbolic.

226
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,675
那么  如果鬼魂不能说话
So, if a ghost couldn't talk,

227
00:12:50,675 --> 00:12:52,526
他们可能会变出东西
They would maybe make an object appear

228
00:12:52,526 --> 00:12:53,862
以此进行交流
As a way of communicating.

229
00:12:53,862 --> 00:12:55,550
这些幻象能自己移动吗
And can these apports move on their own?

230
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,363
没错  猫都能滑水
Yeah, and cats can waterski.

231
00:12:57,363 --> 00:12:58,675
所以它们发光
Is that why they glow?

232
00:12:58,675 --> 00:12:59,863
猫不会发光
Cats don't glow!

233
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:01,817
-幻象  -我知道你说的幻象
- Apports.  - I know you're talking about apports!

234
00:13:01,817 --> 00:13:03,300
-你吼什么  -我没有吼
- Why are you yelling?!  - I'm not yelling.

235
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,363
我在吼  行了吧
I'm yelling, right?!

236
00:13:04,363 --> 00:13:06,057
我错了
I make that mistake.

237
00:13:06,057 --> 00:13:08,254
抱歉  我只是想区分开
I'm sorry. I tend to disassociate.

238
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,739
真会掩饰
That's an understatement.

239
00:13:09,739 --> 00:13:10,925
你想要什么
What do you want?

240
00:13:10,925 --> 00:13:11,675
你来这干什么
Why are you here?

241
00:13:11,675 --> 00:13:13,488
你家出现幻象了
Do you have an apport at home,

242
00:13:13,488 --> 00:13:16,300
而且还幽幽发着鬼光吗
And it's just glowing with ghostly energy?

243
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,237
要是真的  你干嘛不带来测试一下
Well, if that's true, why don't you bring it in so we can test it?

244
00:13:21,938 --> 00:13:23,238
我怎么会看见幻象
Why would I have an apport?

245
00:13:23,238 --> 00:13:26,175
根本没这回事  都是假的  行了吧
I mean, there's no such thing. It's make believe, right?

246
00:13:32,886 --> 00:13:36,458
你  你嘲笑我
You, you baffle me!

247
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,675
臭娘们
You little minx.

248
00:13:45,853 --> 00:13:47,933
我就知道你会回来
I had a feeling you'd be back.

249
00:13:47,933 --> 00:13:48,675
是吗
Really?

250
00:13:49,112 --> 00:13:51,988
谁是回头客  我一看就知
I know a repeat customer when I see one.

251
00:13:51,988 --> 00:13:53,300
还有些东西剩下  
Still got a few things left.

252
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,705
还有饰品吗
Any more ornaments?

253
00:13:54,705 --> 00:13:57,063
没了  你全都买走了
No, don't worry. You've got the only ones.

254
00:13:57,063 --> 00:13:59,353
能告诉我  你从哪进货的吗
I was hoping you could tell me where you got them.

255
00:13:59,353 --> 00:14:00,350
为什么
Why?

256
00:14:00,425 --> 00:14:01,894
万一他们还有呢
In case they have any more.

257
00:14:01,894 --> 00:14:04,114
我看不一定
Well, I doubt that there are.

258
00:14:04,114 --> 00:14:06,135
也是啊  独一无二的
Yeah. Pretty unique.

259
00:14:06,135 --> 00:14:07,963
我不知道它们从哪来的
Well, I don't know where they came from.

260
00:14:07,963 --> 00:14:09,357
如果我知道  会告诉你的
If I did, I'd let you know.

261
00:14:09,357 --> 00:14:12,205
失陪  我要去收拾了
Now, if you excuse me, I gotta get back to my packing.

262
00:14:12,205 --> 00:14:15,612
也许那些饰品是突然冒出来的
Maybe the ornaments just appeared out of nowhere.

263
00:14:18,444 --> 00:14:22,285
什么叫"突然冒出来"
How do you mean "just appeared"?

264
00:14:22,285 --> 00:14:25,425
昨晚  有一套一模一样的饰品
Last night, a set of ornaments just like the ones that you sold me

265
00:14:25,425 --> 00:14:28,766
突然出现在我厨房里
Just appeared on my kitchen table.

266
00:14:29,613 --> 00:14:31,675
看来我没疯
I thought I was going crazy.

267
00:14:31,675 --> 00:14:32,738
你没有
You're not.

268
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:35,342
我昨天绞尽脑汁回想
I racked my brain trying to remember

269
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:38,103
是我是从谁那买的
If I picked 'em up from someone yesterday

270
00:14:38,103 --> 00:14:40,602
还是谁落在店里了
Or if I saw someone drop 'em here at the stall.

271
00:14:40,602 --> 00:14:43,487
有没有一个30多岁的男人
What about a man in his midthirties,

272
00:14:43,487 --> 00:14:46,813
棕色短发  胡子拉茬  肤色苍白
Short brown hair, stubble, pale skin,

273
00:14:46,813 --> 00:14:49,704
衣衫褴褛  不太喜欢直视的男子
A little disheveled, doesn't like to look you in the eye?

274
00:14:49,704 --> 00:14:52,112
我尽力回忆  但没有 
Shifty I tend to remember, but no, no,

275
00:14:52,112 --> 00:14:53,625
实在没印象
He's not ringing a bell.

276
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:56,115
如果看到这样的人  我会告诉你
If I see anybody like that, I'll let you know.

277
00:14:56,115 --> 00:14:58,609
拜托了
Please.

278
00:15:00,804 --> 00:15:02,113
梅林达
Melinda,

279
00:15:03,016 --> 00:15:04,050
等等
Wait.

280
00:15:07,845 --> 00:15:09,785
我刚发现这个
I just found this.

281
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,425
我买了
I'll buy it from you.

282
00:15:14,425 --> 00:15:15,165
不  不  不
No, no, no.

283
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:18,175
你拿着吧  它该属于你
Yyou take it. I think you should have it.

284
00:15:39,265 --> 00:15:40,612
好吧
Ok.

285
00:16:49,623 --> 00:16:52,295
我需要你用专业知识来帮我找这座房子
I need your real estate expertise to find this house.

286
00:16:52,295 --> 00:16:54,162
这房子听起来不错
It sounds like an amazing house,

287
00:16:54,162 --> 00:16:55,643
但你不记得在哪了
But you don't remember where it is?

288
00:16:55,643 --> 00:16:58,362
我没去过  是一位顾客告诉我的
I've never been. A client of mine told me about it.

289
00:16:58,362 --> 00:17:00,195
他不记得地址了
He can't remember the address?

290
00:17:00,195 --> 00:17:01,800
他不住这附近
He's not from around here.

291
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,982
他想买吗
Is he looking to buy?

292
00:17:02,982 --> 00:17:04,675
有生意做吗
Do I have a shot?

293
00:17:04,675 --> 00:17:07,300
我不知道他是否有能力抵押贷款
I'm not so sure he could swing a mortgage,

294
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,672
但他让我很好奇  我想看看
But he's got me curious. I'd love to see it.

295
00:17:09,672 --> 00:17:11,762
这个网站里面
This is the website that tracks

296
00:17:11,762 --> 00:17:14,104
有本地区所有的物业资料
All of the residential properties in the area.

297
00:17:14,104 --> 00:17:16,142
你可以用我的账户查看
You can go ahead and use my account number

298
00:17:16,142 --> 00:17:17,824
输入尽可能多的细节
And just put in as many details as you can

299
00:17:17,824 --> 00:17:19,153
在数据库里找找
And then search the database

300
00:17:19,153 --> 00:17:20,483
看看能否找到
And see if you find the house.

301
00:17:20,683 --> 00:17:22,312
如果你说服他购买
If you convince him to buy,

302
00:17:22,312 --> 00:17:23,584
就把他带过来吧
Will you steer him my way?

303
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,112
多谢
Thank you.

304
00:17:31,034 --> 00:17:33,800
这鬼魂终于肯和你交流了
Well, at least now the ghost is communicating with you.

305
00:17:34,196 --> 00:17:35,800
对  就像这样
Oh, yeah. We're like this.

306
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,999
他不说话  不看我  完全无视我的存在
He won't talk to me, look at me, or even acknowledge my presence.

307
00:17:38,999 --> 00:17:42,253
你说过  他需要更多时间 来适应死亡
Well, you did say it takes some longer than others to adjust to death.

308
00:17:42,253 --> 00:17:44,550
是的  面对死亡  每人反应都不一
Yeah. everybody deals with death differently.

309
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:47,533
迪莉娅到现在还没熬出来呢
I think Delia's having a hard time with it.

310
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:48,987
你告诉她了
Oh, yeah? Did you talk to her?

311
00:17:48,987 --> 00:17:51,738
我想说  但还没找到好时机
I've been meaning to, but I haven't really had the chance.

312
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,550
找到了
That's it.

313
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,113
就是这房子
That's the house.

314
00:18:43,673 --> 00:18:45,362
有人吗
Hello?

315
00:18:46,066 --> 00:18:47,862
有人在家吗
Is anybody home?

316
00:18:49,384 --> 00:18:51,487
有人吗
Hello.

317
00:19:01,255 --> 00:19:02,550
你好
Hello.

318
00:19:13,744 --> 00:19:15,175
小姐
Miss.

319
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,488
等我一下
Give me a minute.

320
00:19:50,425 --> 00:19:51,612
她还好吗
She ok?

321
00:19:51,612 --> 00:19:53,200
身体无大碍
Physically, she's fine.

322
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,175
她只是非常自闭  不愿讲话
She's just completely withdrawn. she won't talk.

323
00:19:56,175 --> 00:19:58,562
跟某人很像
Sounds like somebody else I know.

324
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,554
她叫克莉斯汀·纳尔逊
The woman's Christine Nelson.

325
00:20:00,568 --> 00:20:02,556
在屋内找到了她的身份证
Found her picture I.D. inside.

326
00:20:02,556 --> 00:20:03,720
那男的
And he's,

327
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,410
他叫丹尼斯·海托华
Well, he was Dennis Hightower.

328
00:20:05,428 --> 00:20:06,738
希望能对你有所帮助
I don't know if that does you any good.

329
00:20:07,028 --> 00:20:08,989
这房子里肯定发生过恐怖的事情
Something terrible must have happened in this house.

330
00:20:08,989 --> 00:20:10,736
还记得我第一次看见的意象吗
I mean, do you remember the first vision I had?

331
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,758
两个人打斗 
2 people fighting.

332
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:13,505
我必须要让他跟我谈谈
I have to get him to talk to me.

333
00:20:13,509 --> 00:20:14,621
你找到他的尸体
Look, you found his body.

334
00:20:14,621 --> 00:20:17,236
也许这样就够了  他可以超度了
Maybe that's all he needed to resolve before he could cross over.

335
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,265
但他还在这
But he's still here.

336
00:20:19,281 --> 00:20:22,084
是的  警察也快来了  所以
Yeah, well, the police will be, too, so...

337
00:20:36,866 --> 00:20:37,966
丹尼斯·海托华
Dennis Hightower.

338
00:20:40,133 --> 00:20:42,377
我知道你的名字  你吃惊吗
Are you surprised that I found out your name?

339
00:20:42,816 --> 00:20:45,924
-你的名字  -梅林达
- Your name?  - Melinda.

340
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:48,145
真的很高兴见到你
It's really nice to meet you.

341
00:20:48,699 --> 00:20:50,845
一切都会好的
Everything's gonna be ok now.

342
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,226
我们找到了你的尸体  你可以超度了
We found your body.You can cross over.

343
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:56,105
你只需走进那道光里就行了
All you have to do is go into the light.

344
00:20:59,249 --> 00:21:01,404
丹尼斯  你能看到那道光吗
Dennis, can you see the light?

345
00:21:02,538 --> 00:21:06,734
-你看见一道光   -没有  只有你能看到
- You see the light?  - No. I can't. Only you can.

346
00:21:10,121 --> 00:21:12,233
你还有什么心事吗
Is there something else that you need?

347
00:21:13,328 --> 00:21:16,425
我能帮上你忙的
Something that I can help you with?

348
00:21:16,429 --> 00:21:18,514
告诉我  你出什么事了
Tell me what happened to you.

349
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:20,575
你出什么事了
What happened to you.

350
00:21:21,531 --> 00:21:23,713
你知道  你已经死了  对吧
You know that you're dead, right? 

351
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,815
-对  -谁杀了你
- Right.  - Who did this to you?

352
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:30,193
-你  你  -你怎么听不懂我说的话
- You. You.  - Why don't you understand me?

353
00:21:30,201 --> 00:21:31,966
听懂我说的话
Understand me.

354
00:21:34,948 --> 00:21:37,615
验尸报告说  丹尼斯似乎是被毒死的
Coroner's report says it looks like dennis was poisoned.

355
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,774
他为什么不告诉我
Why didn't he tell me about that?

356
00:21:39,778 --> 00:21:41,784
也许我该告诉克里斯汀
Maybe I'd be better off if I talked to Christine.

357
00:21:41,788 --> 00:21:42,935
交给警察去说吧
Let the police do that.

358
00:21:42,939 --> 00:21:44,902
他明显是想要我找到她
I mean, he obviously led me to her for a reason.

359
00:21:44,902 --> 00:21:46,654
她也许是他生命中很重要的人
She might be an important part of his life.

360
00:21:46,659 --> 00:21:48,665
也可能是他死亡的重要一部分
She might be an important part of his death.

361
00:21:49,168 --> 00:21:50,606
不  你这么认为
No. You think?

362
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,100
丹尼斯和克里斯汀
Dennis and Christine 

363
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,285
也许就是在你的意象里打架的人
might be the 2 people you saw fighting in your vision.

364
00:21:55,289 --> 00:21:56,621
为什么她要毒死丹尼斯
Why would she poison Dennis

365
00:21:56,621 --> 00:21:57,954
又留在尸体旁边
And then stay with the body?

366
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,336
有时内疚感是克制不住的
Guilty don't always run and hide.

367
00:21:59,339 --> 00:22:01,076
也许丹尼斯让你去那房子
Maybe Dennis led you to the house

368
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,443
并不是让你去帮助克里斯汀
not to help christine,

369
00:22:02,443 --> 00:22:03,806
而是找到凶手
But to help you find his killer.

370
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:05,964
他为什么不超度
Why didn't he cross over?

371
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:09,423
说不过你  你应该去找克里斯汀
You're right. You should try and talk to Christin.

372
00:22:12,478 --> 00:22:14,493
[康复中心]

373
00:22:14,854 --> 00:22:15,886
你有预约吗
Do you have an appointment?

374
00:22:15,886 --> 00:22:20,023
没有  我来找个病人  克里斯汀·纳尔逊
No. I'm, uh, looking for a patient, Christine Nelson.

375
00:22:20,031 --> 00:22:23,023
仁济医院急诊室说  她转来这里了
The emergency room at Mercy hospital told me that she was taken here.

376
00:22:23,029 --> 00:22:24,091
今早送来的
This morning.

377
00:22:24,091 --> 00:22:25,154
为什么要转移
And why was she moved?

378
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,925
病人太多  床位太少
Too many heads, not enough beds.

379
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:29,683
如果不是病重  濒死或致命伤的患者
If your condition isn't serious, Life-threatening, or fatal,

380
00:22:29,688 --> 00:22:31,703
就会被转走  跟我来
you get turfed out. Follow me.

381
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:35,805
克里斯汀  有人来看你了
Christine, you have a visitor.

382
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,175
我们昨天在你的房子里见过
We met yesterday at your house.

383
00:22:38,216 --> 00:22:40,226
我是梅林达·戈登
I'm Melinda Gordon.

384
00:22:42,471 --> 00:22:44,633
我先回去工作了
I should get back to my desk.

385
00:22:48,499 --> 00:22:50,372
我知道警察来过
I know that the police were here

386
00:22:50,372 --> 00:22:52,245
你不想跟他们说
And you wouldn't talk to them.

387
00:22:52,631 --> 00:22:56,465
我不是警察  你告诉我吧
I'm not the police, and I need you to talk to me.

388
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:58,843
我认识丹尼斯
I knew Dennis.

389
00:22:59,058 --> 00:23:01,265
我知道他是怎么死的
I think I know how he died,

390
00:23:01,265 --> 00:23:03,473
但我想弄清其中缘由
But it would help to know why.

391
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,280
克里斯汀  你听到我说话了吗
Christine, can you hear me?

392
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,686
克里斯汀恢复交流能力
It's gonna take some time before Christine's

393
00:23:10,688 --> 00:23:13,526
可能还需要点时间
communicatmmn skills are back to where they were.

394
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:17,055
戈登女士  我是希拉里·斯隆医生
Ms. Gordon, Dr. Hillary sloan.

395
00:23:17,068 --> 00:23:19,998
我以为她没有遭受物理伤害
I thought that she didn't suffer any physical damage.

396
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:21,231
的确没有
She didn't.

397
00:23:21,231 --> 00:23:22,521
但这场突然的变故
But this kind of change

398
00:23:22,521 --> 00:23:25,265
对自闭症患者来说  打击不小
Is a lot for a person with autism to process.

399
00:23:27,229 --> 00:23:30,353
等等  你说克里斯汀患有自闭症
Wait. Did you just say that Christine is autistic?

400
00:23:32,531 --> 00:23:34,505
你现在有时间吗
Do you have a minute?

401
00:23:51,167 --> 00:23:56,155
如你所见  他们喜欢猜谜和游戏
As you can see, they like puzzles and games.

402
00:23:56,155 --> 00:24:00,193
踱步  拍手  来回走动
Pacing, hand flapping, rocking back and forth-

403
00:24:00,197 --> 00:24:04,110
这全是自闭症的典型表现
they are all coping mechanisms for people with autism.

404
00:24:04,115 --> 00:24:07,551
有些高功能自闭症患者
You know, there are high-functioning people with autism

405
00:24:07,551 --> 00:24:10,580
已经能在一定程度上与他人相处
who've learned to behave in a more socially acceptable way.

406
00:24:10,586 --> 00:24:12,583
但大多数都不合群
A lot of them are loners.

407
00:24:12,587 --> 00:24:15,611
他们更喜欢与物相处  而不是人
They relate better to objects than they do to people.

408
00:24:15,617 --> 00:24:17,543
不喜爱说话
They don't like to talk.

409
00:24:17,545 --> 00:24:19,683
也不看对方的眼睛
Or look you in the eye.

410
00:24:20,037 --> 00:24:23,221
他们不遵守我们的社交习惯
They don't follow a lot of our social rules.

411
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:25,060
丹尼斯也患有自闭症
Dennis is autistic.

412
00:24:25,066 --> 00:24:28,312
克里斯汀和丹尼斯20岁开始就住一起了
Christine and Dennis had lived together since their twenties.

413
00:24:28,316 --> 00:24:29,442
他们是夫妻吗
They were a couple.

414
00:24:29,447 --> 00:24:32,731
是的  他们请了一个保姆  每周来一次
Yes. They had a home-care worker who came over once a week.

415
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:36,152
除此之外  就只有丹尼斯照顾她
Other than that, Dennis took care of her.

416
00:24:46,187 --> 00:24:48,672
她从哪里弄来的
Where did she get this?

417
00:24:49,105 --> 00:24:51,202
这是我的
Oh. Um, that's mine.

418
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:55,250
我店里卖这个  她一定是从我包里找到的
I sell those in my store. She must have taken it from my purse.

419
00:24:55,618 --> 00:24:57,391
很漂亮
It's beautiful.

420
00:27:17,848 --> 00:27:20,043
-是烤炉  -什么
- It was the oven.  - I'm sorry?

421
00:27:21,527 --> 00:27:23,950
我知道丹尼斯怎么死的了
I know how Dennis died.

422
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:35,932
等等  如果真是一氧化碳中毒
Wait, if it was carbon monoxide poisoning,

423
00:27:35,937 --> 00:27:37,553
为什么克里斯汀没事 
how come Christine wasn't affected?

424
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:39,371
因为她习惯  回到家后
Because it's her ritual every time she comes home

425
00:27:39,371 --> 00:27:40,559
打开所有的窗户
to open up all the windows.

426
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,450
我看到了
I saw it in a vision.

427
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:43,631
她不是杀人犯
She's not a murderer.

428
00:27:43,636 --> 00:27:45,700
-女杀人犯  -说得好
- Murderess.  - Touche.

429
00:27:47,475 --> 00:27:49,320
问题是为什么丹尼斯还不走
Question is why is Dennis still here?

430
00:27:49,326 --> 00:27:51,603
我找到了克里斯汀  她很安全  还有什么
I found Christine. She's safe. What more is there?

431
00:27:51,605 --> 00:27:53,921
我倒想知道  为何丹尼斯还是那么自闭
What I wanna know is Why is Dennis still autistic.

432
00:27:53,928 --> 00:27:55,560
他死后  就应该痊愈了  不是吗
If he's dead, he should be cured, right?

433
00:27:55,567 --> 00:27:57,620
理论上说是这样  所有灵魂都是完美的
Mmm, technically, yes. Every soul is perfect.

434
00:27:57,625 --> 00:27:58,773
他们超度时
When they cross over,

435
00:27:58,773 --> 00:28:00,401
所有的缺陷都不会再影响他们
The handicaps they had in life no longer affect them,

436
00:28:00,407 --> 00:28:01,814
但如果他是地缚灵
but if they're earthbound,

437
00:28:01,814 --> 00:28:03,221
它们有时会和以前一样
Sometimes they cling to the familiar.

438
00:28:03,226 --> 00:28:04,513
他们不能忘记过去的自己
They can't let go of who they were.

439
00:28:04,528 --> 00:28:06,632
他也算是回答了你  是吧
He did answer your questions at some point, didn't he?

440
00:28:06,635 --> 00:28:08,522
他学我说话  叫做模仿言语
He's been mimicking me. It's called echolalia.

441
00:28:08,528 --> 00:28:10,596
他通过学你讲话  来让你知道
It's when they echo whatever you say so you know

442
00:28:10,596 --> 00:28:12,793
虽然他们不回答  但是听到你说话了
that they can hear you, even if they can't respond.

443
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:15,790
就是说  他一直在和你交流
Ok, so all this time, he has been communicating with you,

444
00:28:15,797 --> 00:28:17,805
-只不过是用他的方法  -是的  通过这些装饰品
- ... just in his own way.  - Yes, through the ornaments.

445
00:28:17,805 --> 00:28:19,593
我最后碰过的那个  告诉了我他怎么死的
The last one that I touched showed me how he died.

446
00:28:19,596 --> 00:28:22,671
但愿其中一块饰品能解释他不走的原因
Let's hope the answer to why he's still here is in one of those.

447
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,404
这些东西
These objects,

448
00:28:27,404 --> 00:28:29,313
跟平常的物件没什么两样
They don't vibrate any more or less than your average object.

449
00:28:29,316 --> 00:28:32,723
你一点都看不到  听不到他们的内心吗
And you can't see or hear anything coming from inside them?

450
00:28:32,726 --> 00:28:34,162
看到啥  电影吗
Like what? What, a movie?

451
00:28:34,165 --> 00:28:36,275
我会看到电影吗  还是听到口技
What am I gonna see, a movie? Listen to, show tunes?

452
00:28:36,275 --> 00:28:37,693
这是木头的  跟我脑袋一样
It's wood. It's like my head.

453
00:28:37,693 --> 00:28:39,090
再普通不过了
Lady, it's normal.

454
00:28:39,096 --> 00:28:41,410
它们一点也不普通
There's nothing normal about them.

455
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:44,569
你朋友说
So your "friend" said

456
00:28:44,569 --> 00:28:47,723
她拿着这些饰品时  能感觉到自己在移动
She felt transported after she held these ornaments?

457
00:28:47,845 --> 00:28:50,481
-是的  -好  我正拿着这些饰品
- Yes.  - Ok. Well, I held these ornaments.

458
00:28:50,488 --> 00:28:51,940
我一动也没动
I'm still here.

459
00:28:52,675 --> 00:28:56,300
你朋友看到这意象是什么时候
What time of day did your friend say she had these visions?

460
00:28:56,306 --> 00:28:58,200
发生时间很重要吗
Why is the time of day important?

461
00:28:58,207 --> 00:29:00,250
当然  如果是快活完后发生的
Well, yeah. If she did it right after happy hour,

462
00:29:00,257 --> 00:29:02,563
-就非常重要   -是的  是很有趣
- I'd say it's very important.  - Yeah, that's real funny.

463
00:29:02,598 --> 00:29:05,101
我以为你至少对此会有职业上的好奇心
I thought you would at least have a professional curiosity about this.

464
00:29:05,107 --> 00:29:06,220
我很好奇
Oh, I'm curious.

465
00:29:06,226 --> 00:29:07,954
我对你很感兴趣
I have a lot of curiosity about you,

466
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:09,683
特别是你来做什么
About what you're doing here.

467
00:29:09,688 --> 00:29:12,613
我只想知道  你能否从饰品里看到东西
I just wanna know If you can see anything in these ornaments.

468
00:29:12,616 --> 00:29:14,383
梅林达  从你进来开始
Melinda, you haven't touched any of these ornaments

469
00:29:14,386 --> 00:29:16,300
你就没碰过这些饰品   一个也没有
since you've been here, not directly, not one.

470
00:29:16,306 --> 00:29:19,292
我想知道你碰它们时会发生什么
I wanna know what happens when you touch these ornaments.

471
00:29:19,505 --> 00:29:22,591
-我不知道   -我想找出答案
- I don't know.  - Yeah, well, I'd like to find out.

472
00:29:22,597 --> 00:29:24,749
这个  这兔子图案的
This one, the bunny,

473
00:29:24,749 --> 00:29:27,401
比其它饰品的能量更高
Had a higher energy rating than the other ornaments.

474
00:29:27,406 --> 00:29:29,640
当你碰它时  会发生什么
What happens when you touch that guy?

475
00:29:37,498 --> 00:29:38,990
我以为你是个信科学的人
You know, I thought you were a man of science,

476
00:29:38,998 --> 00:29:40,951
你这也太不科学了
And there's nothing scientific about this.

477
00:29:40,966 --> 00:29:44,222
收集经验数据  怎么不科学了
What's more scientific than collecting my own empirical data?

478
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,922
你要呆在这里
You're going to stay here right now, Christine.

479
00:30:03,515 --> 00:30:06,317
我爱你  亲爱的
I love you, sweetie.

480
00:30:06,958 --> 00:30:11,353
不  别  妈妈  不要离开我
No! Stop it!  Mami... Don't leave me!

481
00:30:12,986 --> 00:30:14,482
怎么  发生了什么
What? What happened?

482
00:30:15,238 --> 00:30:16,883
你看见了什么
What did you see?

483
00:30:17,427 --> 00:30:20,762
我看见一个孩子被人从母亲身边带走
I saw a child being taken from her mother.

484
00:30:21,005 --> 00:30:23,061
你说真的吗
Are you telling me the truth?

485
00:30:23,068 --> 00:30:25,510
教授  我只能说  如果我走出这扇门之后
All I can say, professor, if I could walk out of here

486
00:30:25,517 --> 00:30:27,773
发现我们所说的这些都是虚构的
knowing that everything we've talked about was made up,

487
00:30:27,777 --> 00:30:29,649
我就是世上最幸福的女孩
I would be the happiest girl on earth.

488
00:30:29,649 --> 00:30:31,521
等等  灵媒
Wait. Psychometry.

489
00:30:31,836 --> 00:30:35,221
你刚刚说的叫作灵媒
What you're talking about is called psychometry.

490
00:30:35,228 --> 00:30:37,079
就是说  你能通过触碰物件
It's when you get visions or flashes

491
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:38,931
看到过去发生的事情
of the past from touching these objects.

492
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:43,163
-有道理  -你见到了  当然信
- That makes sense.  - Easy for you to say.

493
00:30:44,295 --> 00:30:46,613
你能不能对这些饰品做更多试验
Maybe if you did some more tests on the ornaments.

494
00:30:46,615 --> 00:30:48,782
我想在你身上做些试验
I'd like to actually do some tests on you, Melinda.

495
00:30:48,786 --> 00:30:49,771
感谢你的讲解
Thanks for your time.

496
00:30:49,777 --> 00:30:51,552
梅林达  我不是要把你绑手术台上
Melinda, I'm not talking about root canal here.

497
00:30:51,556 --> 00:30:54,520
而是科学的  受控制的试验
I'm talking about very scientific, controlled tests.

498
00:30:54,526 --> 00:30:56,222
这能帮助我们
They could- they can help us.

499
00:30:56,225 --> 00:30:59,921
-我不是实验品  -梅林达  听我说
- I'm not an experiment.  - Melinda, listen.

500
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:05,493
你若再看到灵媒  过来找我
When you get a chance, just come by.

501
00:31:05,506 --> 00:31:07,462
告诉我更多的事情
Come by and talk to me some more.

502
00:31:07,467 --> 00:31:09,340
这很重要
This is important.

503
00:31:19,805 --> 00:31:21,039
我认为这不止关系到他
I don't think it's about him.

504
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,273
而是他们俩
I think it's about both of them.

505
00:31:22,277 --> 00:31:24,090
对了  那个也卖的
Oh, that's on sale, by the way.

506
00:31:24,095 --> 00:31:26,144
这像是他对两人生活的记忆
It's like it's his memories of their life together,

507
00:31:26,144 --> 00:31:27,591
他怎么死的  初次邂逅的情景
you know, how he died, when he first saw her.

508
00:31:27,606 --> 00:31:29,042
-是的  -无论丹尼斯要什么
- That makes sense. - Well, whatever Dennis wants,

509
00:31:29,042 --> 00:31:30,651
都跟克里斯汀有关
it has something to do with Christine somehow.

510
00:31:30,657 --> 00:31:32,132
真可惜  她不能和你说话
It's too bad she won't talk to you.

511
00:31:32,137 --> 00:31:33,793
也许她对这些饰品有反应
Maybe she'll respond to the ornaments.

512
00:31:34,137 --> 00:31:35,839
我把这些拿到医院去
I thought that I would take them down to the hospital

513
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:37,542
看能不能达到效果
And see if it could spark anything

514
00:31:37,547 --> 00:31:40,091
我如果现在出发  还能赶上探视时间
Besides, if I leave now, I can still make visiting hours.

515
00:31:40,097 --> 00:31:42,680
好  我想帮你看店  不过
Well, I'd offer to mind the store, but...

516
00:31:42,686 --> 00:31:44,593
没关系  我知道你忙于救活人
it's ok. I know that you're busy saving lives

517
00:31:44,593 --> 00:31:46,101
我忙于救死人
While I'm saving the dead.

518
00:31:47,437 --> 00:31:49,060
-拜  -再见
- Bye. - See ya.

519
00:32:11,545 --> 00:32:13,732
内德今天表现怎样
How'd, uh, Ned do today?

520
00:32:13,736 --> 00:32:16,153
-我提早让他回家了  -真的
- Oh, I sent him home early.  - Really?

521
00:32:16,155 --> 00:32:17,980
-他又犯什么事儿了  -没犯事儿
- What did he do now?  - Oh, no. Nothing.

522
00:32:17,987 --> 00:32:20,372
没事  我关店了
It's fine. It's just I had to close up.

523
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:21,403
我要去做件事
I have an errand to run.

524
00:32:21,978 --> 00:32:24,391
那我就不耽误你了
Well, don't let me keep you.

525
00:32:24,407 --> 00:32:26,690
他给你添麻烦了就告诉我  好吗
You just let me know if he causes you any trouble, ok?

526
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:28,693
我最讨厌的就是  明明自己不好受
You know, what I hate is when people ask if you're ok

527
00:32:28,707 --> 00:32:31,000
别人还问我好不好
when you're so obviously not.

528
00:32:34,437 --> 00:32:37,140
是啊  我也讨厌
Yeah. I hate that, too.

529
00:32:37,646 --> 00:32:40,510
所以  你还好吗
So, are you ok?

530
00:32:41,905 --> 00:32:44,590
不  只是
I- no. It's just...

531
00:32:45,206 --> 00:32:47,811
说不清  日子每天都一样
I don't know. It's just been one of those days.

532
00:32:47,928 --> 00:32:50,552
我卖房子卖到吐了
I am so sick of selling houses.

533
00:32:51,176 --> 00:32:52,563
我每溜达一圈
Every time I turn around,

534
00:32:52,568 --> 00:32:55,840
都能遇见新婚夫妇首次买房
There's this new couple buying their house for the first time.

535
00:32:55,906 --> 00:32:59,472
相互争论哪间房作书房  哪间作客厅
They're arguing about where to put the office or the guest room.

536
00:33:00,277 --> 00:33:03,302
不是新婚夫妇  就是初为父母者
And if it's not newlyweds, then it's new parents, and...

537
00:33:04,736 --> 00:33:07,211
讨论哪间房作婴儿房
They're trying to figure out where the baby room goes.

538
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:10,222
每个人都有自己的生活
Everybody has their whole life ahead of them.

539
00:33:11,158 --> 00:33:13,550
你和查理结婚多久了
How long were you and Charlie married?

540
00:33:15,826 --> 00:33:18,461
有时我感觉我们仍是夫妇
Sometimes it feels like we're still married.

541
00:33:19,827 --> 00:33:21,930
他去世三年了
He's been dead for 3 years now.

542
00:33:23,078 --> 00:33:26,531
我刚刚从悲痛中走出来
I've just been having such a hard time moving on.

543
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:28,562
内德也很坚强
And Ned's been acting out.

544
00:33:29,068 --> 00:33:30,109
我知道他需要我
I know he needs me,

545
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:34,151
我也在尽我所能地守着他
And I am doing everything I can to be there for him.

546
00:33:35,387 --> 00:33:37,122
我明白
I understand.

547
00:33:39,297 --> 00:33:40,970
随便了
Anyway-heh.

548
00:33:41,697 --> 00:33:44,401
你还没告诉我你的秘密
Why don't you tell me your secret?

549
00:33:44,405 --> 00:33:47,512
找份喜欢的工作  能帮你转移注意力
Oh, well, having work that you love takes your mind off things.

550
00:33:47,518 --> 00:33:50,551
不过我的工作却恰恰相反
Ah. Well, my work does just the opposite.

551
00:33:50,556 --> 00:33:52,892
也许你该换份新工作
Well, maybe you should try something new.

552
00:33:52,895 --> 00:33:55,953
换什么  脑外科医生  战斗机驾驶员
Like what? Brain surgeon? Fighter pilot?

553
00:33:55,955 --> 00:33:58,777
你应该挑个更有挑战性的
Heh. I was thinking of something even more challenging,

554
00:33:58,777 --> 00:33:59,600
比如
Like...

555
00:34:00,427 --> 00:34:02,830
不如来和我一起工作吧
Why don't you come and work with me?

556
00:34:03,566 --> 00:34:06,870
-什么  -我真的需要人手
- What?  - I need the help really bad,

557
00:34:06,887 --> 00:34:09,253
虽然我付的工钱比不上你的售房佣金
And I can't pay as much as one of your sales commissions,

558
00:34:09,266 --> 00:34:11,622
但却是份稳定的收入
but it's a steady check everyweek.

559
00:34:11,722 --> 00:34:13,866
我想你会喜欢的
And I think you will really like it.

560
00:34:13,866 --> 00:34:16,141
-你说真的  -是的
- You're serious?  - Yeah.

561
00:34:19,338 --> 00:34:22,492
-干嘛  -我真是看不透你
- What?  - I just can't figure you out.

562
00:34:22,497 --> 00:34:24,203
你就像是个
You're like some kind of...

563
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:26,491
守护天使
Guardian angel or something.

564
00:34:29,146 --> 00:34:32,173
答应我  好好考虑一下
Promise me that you'll at least think about it.

565
00:34:41,017 --> 00:34:42,502
小兔子
Bunny.

566
00:34:44,135 --> 00:34:45,640
树
Tree.

567
00:34:48,536 --> 00:34:50,333
蝴蝶
Butterfly.

568
00:34:52,728 --> 00:34:54,101
蛋糕
Cake.

569
00:34:55,206 --> 00:34:56,771
房子
House.

570
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,570
自行车
Bike.

571
00:35:00,617 --> 00:35:02,613
摇椅
Rocking chair.

572
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:06,190
这些对你有什么含义  克里斯汀
What do these mean to you, christine?

573
00:35:07,025 --> 00:35:09,322
小兔子带我上学
Bunny took me to school.

574
00:35:10,177 --> 00:35:13,251
她戴一只蝴蝶在颈边
She wore a butterfly around her neck.

575
00:35:13,257 --> 00:35:16,632
她教我骑自行车
She taught me how to ride a bike.

576
00:35:17,347 --> 00:35:19,860
我们坐在房前的树下
We sat under the tree in front of the house.

577
00:35:20,828 --> 00:35:22,430
谁是小兔子
Who is bunny?

578
00:35:23,198 --> 00:35:26,360
谁戴着蝴蝶项链带你去学校
Who wore a butterfly necklace and took you to school?

579
00:35:26,365 --> 00:35:29,513
-她   -她是谁
- She did.  - who is she?

580
00:35:30,397 --> 00:35:33,872
妈妈  她是妈妈
Mommy. Mommy is she.

581
00:35:37,346 --> 00:35:38,870
是她妈妈
It's her mother.

582
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:42,080
这些饰品象征着她妈妈
These ornaments symbolize mommy to Christine.

583
00:35:42,095 --> 00:35:44,472
这就是你想要我做的吗
Is that what you wanted me to do...

584
00:35:45,115 --> 00:35:47,302
找到克里斯汀的妈妈
Find Christine's mother?

585
00:35:47,307 --> 00:35:49,993
找到克里斯汀的妈妈
F- find Christine's mother.

586
00:35:50,925 --> 00:35:52,562
是的
I did.

587
00:36:06,258 --> 00:36:08,239
不  不  不  是正面朝上的
Oh, no. No, no, no. They're faceup.

588
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:10,221
这样放不对
That's- that's the wrong way.

589
00:36:16,158 --> 00:36:19,091
-这是拼图  -这是拼图
- This is a puzzle? - This is a puzzle.

590
00:36:27,327 --> 00:36:29,113
小兔子
Bunny.

591
00:36:31,478 --> 00:36:33,730
这是她母亲
That's her mother?

592
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:40,963
我想这些是你的
I believe these were meant for you.

593
00:36:52,758 --> 00:36:55,142
你为什么把克里斯汀送走
Why did you give Christine away?

594
00:36:55,317 --> 00:36:59,652
你要知道  克里斯汀出生那时
You have to understand that back when Christine was born,

595
00:36:59,655 --> 00:37:02,371
人们对自闭症了解不多
people didn't know that much about autism.

596
00:37:03,347 --> 00:37:05,935
你能想象你的孩子
Can you imagine having a child

597
00:37:05,935 --> 00:37:08,523
不能看着你或对你微笑吗
that won't look at you or smile,

598
00:37:09,316 --> 00:37:12,834
你能想象你一碰她
A child that starts to cry every time

599
00:37:12,834 --> 00:37:14,953
她就会哭吗
You try to touch her?

600
00:37:15,447 --> 00:37:17,949
我带克里斯汀去看医生
I took Christine to a doctor,

601
00:37:17,949 --> 00:37:20,451
医生说是我的错
And he told me it was my fault.

602
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:23,708
他说她得自闭症
He said the reason she was autistic was

603
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:26,312
是因为我这个母亲不称职
Because I was a bad mother.

604
00:37:26,315 --> 00:37:28,190
这太可怕了
That's terrible.

605
00:37:28,197 --> 00:37:29,912
不过  不止说我一个人
Well, I wasn't the only one.

606
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:33,311
他们管我们叫冷酷的母亲
Said we were refrigerator mothers

607
00:37:33,316 --> 00:37:35,742
因为我们对孩子太冷酷
because we were so cold and frigid

608
00:37:35,746 --> 00:37:39,004
孩子找不到人安慰自己
that our children had no one to turn to for comfort,

609
00:37:39,004 --> 00:37:41,999
于是转而自我封闭
so they turned inside themselves.

610
00:37:44,086 --> 00:37:45,921
所以你让医生带走了她
So you let them take her.

611
00:37:45,926 --> 00:37:49,871
我曾想去看她  但他们不让
I tried to see her, to visit, but they said I couldn't,

612
00:37:51,646 --> 00:37:53,544
他们说  若想让她好起来
Said if she was ever gonna get any better,

613
00:37:53,544 --> 00:37:55,443
我就不能见她
I had to stay away.

614
00:37:56,295 --> 00:37:59,130
她成年后你去看过她吗
Didn't you see her when she was a grown-up?

615
00:38:01,598 --> 00:38:03,220
有过一次
Once.

616
00:38:06,647 --> 00:38:10,103
她和一个年轻人住在一起
She was living with a young man.

617
00:38:11,138 --> 00:38:13,592
他也是自闭症患者
He was autistic, too.

618
00:38:14,597 --> 00:38:16,403
但是死在一次争吵中
But it ended up in a fight...

619
00:38:16,417 --> 00:38:17,912
别管我
Leave me alone!

620
00:38:19,318 --> 00:38:21,361
我看到了那次争吵
I saw that fight.

621
00:38:22,475 --> 00:38:25,022
-什么  -这不重要
- Wh-what? - It's not important.

622
00:38:25,418 --> 00:38:27,000
重要的是
What is important is that

623
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,701
你要再去见克里斯汀
You have to try again with Christine.

624
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,080
她需要你
She needs you.

625
00:38:53,738 --> 00:38:57,800
我的小宝贝  长大了
It's my baby girl, all grown up.

626
00:38:58,735 --> 00:39:01,262
她依然封闭在自己的世界里
She's still in her own little world.

627
00:39:01,267 --> 00:39:04,802
克里斯汀  你妈妈来看你了
Christine, your mother's here to see you.

628
00:39:11,508 --> 00:39:14,052
克里斯汀  我是妈妈
C- Christine, it's-it's mommy.

629
00:39:18,627 --> 00:39:22,432
-真的对不起  -真的对不起
- I am so sorry. - I am so sorry.

630
00:39:25,725 --> 00:39:30,703
没关系  她听着呢  告诉她你的感受
It's ok. She hears you. Just tell her how you feel.

631
00:39:31,488 --> 00:39:33,092
她没有怨恨你
She's not holding a grudge,

632
00:39:33,696 --> 00:39:36,970
我保证  她没生你的气
and I promise that she is not angry with you.

633
00:39:36,976 --> 00:39:39,118
我是否在这儿
Doesn't make one bit of difference to her

634
00:39:39,118 --> 00:39:41,260
对她丝毫没有影响
Whether I'm here or not.

635
00:39:43,315 --> 00:39:45,531
不是这样的
That- that is not true.

636
00:39:46,266 --> 00:39:50,281
说"爱需要耐心"  说"爱需要耐心"
S- say, "love is patient. " Say, "love is patient. "

637
00:39:50,285 --> 00:39:52,401
你需要耐心些
You just have to be patient.

638
00:40:03,716 --> 00:40:06,011
亲爱的
Sweetheart...

639
00:40:29,275 --> 00:40:31,683
莉斯  莉斯  等等
Liz, Liz, wait.

640
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,857
我根本不该来
This was a mistake.

641
00:40:35,857 --> 00:40:37,450
她现在最需要你
She needs you now more than ever.

642
00:40:37,456 --> 00:40:40,631
我的孩子不需要我  从来不需要
My child doesn't need me. She never has.

643
00:40:40,636 --> 00:40:42,563
谁都需要母亲
Everyone needs their mother.

644
00:40:42,568 --> 00:40:46,251
可再也不可能爱我  梅林达
But she will never be able to love me, melinda.

645
00:40:46,256 --> 00:40:48,660
她甚至不知道什么是爱
She doesn't even know what love is.

646
00:40:48,668 --> 00:40:51,225
你错了  克里斯汀是爱你的
That's not true. Christine loves.

647
00:40:51,225 --> 00:40:52,283
她只是不知道如何表达
She just doesn't know how to show it.

648
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:54,113
她男朋友  一直在教他如何表达
Her boyfriend, he was teaching her how.

649
00:40:54,116 --> 00:40:56,008
爱是教不会的
You can't teach somebody how to love.

650
00:40:56,008 --> 00:40:57,901
感受不到就是感受不到
They either feel it, or they don't.

651
00:40:57,907 --> 00:41:01,331
-问她  -你爱克里斯汀吗
- Ask her.  - Do you love christine?

652
00:41:02,005 --> 00:41:03,871
我想爱  但是
I want to, but...

653
00:41:05,167 --> 00:41:08,091
我不懂如何单方面地爱
I don't know how if she can't love me back.

654
00:41:08,575 --> 00:41:10,352
那你就该先让她感受到你的爱
Well, then you have to show her love first,

655
00:41:10,358 --> 00:41:12,913
哪怕她不知道怎么去爱你
Even if it means she doesn't know how to love you.

656
00:41:13,598 --> 00:41:15,094
丹尼斯只是希望
I think all Dennis wants is

657
00:41:15,094 --> 00:41:17,590
你能回到克里斯汀身边
Just for you to be in Christine's life again.

658
00:41:24,535 --> 00:41:27,513
我也希望这样
That's what I want, too.

659
00:41:33,745 --> 00:41:35,650
谢谢你
Thank you.

660
00:41:39,217 --> 00:41:40,679
希望这是你的心愿
I hope this is what you wanted.

661
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:42,141
这是你的心愿  对吧
This is what you wanted, right?

662
00:41:42,146 --> 00:41:44,780
-是的  -你准备好了吗
- Right.  - Are you ready to go?

663
00:41:44,785 --> 00:41:48,262
-去哪  -走进光里  你依然看不见吗
- Where?  - Into the light. Can't you still see it?

664
00:41:50,525 --> 00:41:54,750
-我看见太阳  -不是太阳  那是光
- Mm-hmm. I see the sun.  - No, not the sun. The light.

665
00:41:54,755 --> 00:41:56,450
太阳就是那道光
The sun is the light.

666
00:41:56,578 --> 00:41:59,191
你看见那道光了
I thought you could see the light.

667
00:41:59,525 --> 00:42:02,363
你还有什么需要我帮你的吗
Is there something else than I can help you with?

668
00:42:03,278 --> 00:42:08,180
你知道爱是什么  什么是爱
You know what love is. What is love?

669
00:42:10,357 --> 00:42:12,511
是什么感觉
What does it feel like?

670
00:42:16,216 --> 00:42:20,452
丹尼斯  你帮助莉斯和克里斯汀重聚
Dennis, what you did to bring Liz and Christine together,

671
00:42:21,498 --> 00:42:24,010
这就是爱
That's what love is.

672
00:42:24,548 --> 00:42:28,103
说什么不重要  重要的是行动
It's not about what we say. It's about what we do.
