2
00:00:11,121 --> 00:00:12,121
Hello.

3
00:00:12,121 --> 00:00:14,001
Ricky here with your
Thursday Newsround.

4
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:17,641
First up, President Trump has
stopped travel from lots of European

5
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:21,481
countries to America to try to stop
the spread of the coronavirus there.

6
00:00:21,481 --> 00:00:23,881
New rules will come into force
tomorrow but won't affect

7
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:25,841
those travelling from the UK.

8
00:00:25,841 --> 00:00:28,081
Meanwhile Prime Minister Boris
Johnson has a big coronavirus

9
00:00:28,081 --> 00:00:30,801
meeting later today to decide
what the government's next steps

10
00:00:30,801 --> 00:00:32,921
are for this country.

11
00:00:32,921 --> 00:00:38,601
Mr Trump says he's focussed
on keeping Americans safe.

12
00:00:38,601 --> 00:00:41,881
To keep new cases from
entering our shores,

13
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:44,761
we will be suspending all travel
from Europe to the United States

14
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:48,281
for the next 30 days.

15
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:54,041
The new rules will go
into effect Friday at midnight.

16
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:56,441
In Italy, many shops,
public areas and schools have been

17
00:00:56,441 --> 00:00:58,841
closed to help stop the spread
of the coronavirus there.

18
00:00:58,841 --> 00:01:00,521
So what's it like living like that?

19
00:01:00,521 --> 00:01:02,721
Well, we asked Evie
who's in northern Italy.

20
00:01:02,721 --> 00:01:04,761
Hi, Newsround.

21
00:01:04,761 --> 00:01:06,441
I'm Evie and I'm 11 years old.

22
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:09,401
I live with my family here in Italy.

23
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:18,641
It's kind of boring.

24
00:01:18,641 --> 00:01:21,001
I don't have my friends
so I've got nobody really

25
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:22,561
to talk to about school.

26
00:01:22,561 --> 00:01:24,961
At first it was quite
nice because it was only

27
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:30,241
two weeks, we thought.

28
00:01:30,241 --> 00:01:33,601
It was like, "Oh, it's a little
holiday," but now it's proving to be

29
00:01:33,601 --> 00:01:35,441
a bit more difficult.

30
00:01:35,441 --> 00:01:37,841
It is a sensible idea
to be on lockdown because

31
00:01:37,841 --> 00:01:40,961
it means less people

32
00:01:40,961 --> 00:01:43,841
and less people in hospitals
and less rush, so I do think

33
00:01:43,841 --> 00:01:51,401
it is a better idea.

34
00:01:51,401 --> 00:01:57,161
For me, it sounds a lot scarier
than it really is because it's

35
00:01:57,161 --> 00:02:00,041
really just like a holiday with work
and it's not that scary.

36
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,841
You don't have to be scared.

37
00:02:01,841 --> 00:02:08,041
It's just, you know,
you'll be limited.

38
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:12,441
Sometimes we do go out for hikes.

39
00:02:12,441 --> 00:02:16,041
I have been once with my mum and dad
to the supermarket and we actually

40
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:18,681
all went as a family trip
because everybody was getting kind

41
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:23,001
of fed up so we had a family
trip to the supermarket.

42
00:02:23,001 --> 00:02:26,081
Everybody knows that they need
to keep their distance and they do.

43
00:02:26,081 --> 00:02:33,161
You kind of have
to live like a ghost.

44
00:02:33,161 --> 00:02:36,041
When you are walking to school have
you ever had to step

45
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:38,921
onto the road or squeeze past a car
because a driver has

46
00:02:38,921 --> 00:02:39,961
parked on the pavement?

47
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:43,401
Well, a new ban could be coming.

48
00:02:43,401 --> 00:02:46,041
It already exists in London and now
more local authorities around

49
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:50,401
the country could get powers
to tackle the issue.

50
00:02:50,401 --> 00:02:53,041
OK, time for a quick
round-up of some of the big

51
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,601
sport stories today.

52
00:02:54,601 --> 00:02:57,041
It was bad news
for the Lionesses after England

53
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,441
failed to defend their She Believes
trophy after a seventh

54
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:01,161
defeat in 11 games.

55
00:03:01,161 --> 00:03:06,121
They lost 1-0 to Spain
in their final match

56
00:03:06,121 --> 00:03:09,521
of the tournament while USA beat
Japan 3-1 to win the competition.

57
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:11,001
Last year's
European champions Liverpool

58
00:03:11,001 --> 00:03:13,641
are out of the Champions League
after they were beaten 3-2

59
00:03:13,641 --> 00:03:15,801
by Atletico Madrid last night
with some goalkeeping mistakes

60
00:03:15,801 --> 00:03:22,961
by Adrian costing them dearly.

61
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:25,241
And Neymar helped French
champions Paris St Germain

62
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:27,401
beat Borussia Dortmund to reach
the quarter finals.

63
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:30,281
But due to the coronavirus,
the game took place in an empty

64
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:35,481
stadium because fans are banned
from attending matches.

65
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,881
Keepy-uppies are tricky
at the best of times but how

66
00:03:37,881 --> 00:03:42,001
about doing them while crossing
the world's largest frozen lake?

67
00:03:42,001 --> 00:03:46,321
That's what Kickabout's freestyler
John Farnwoth's latest

68
00:03:46,321 --> 00:03:47,921
charity challenge is all about.

69
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:51,721
Let's get going!

70
00:03:51,721 --> 00:03:55,881
I think we are, well,
maybe halfway through.

71
00:03:55,881 --> 00:04:01,321
I'm not sure exactly where we are.

72
00:04:01,321 --> 00:04:04,441
It's very hard to get a perspective
because it's just miles and miles

73
00:04:04,441 --> 00:04:11,281
and miles of ice and snow.

74
00:04:11,281 --> 00:04:14,841
Non-stop keepy-uppies across this
frozen lake in Siberia,

75
00:04:14,841 --> 00:04:17,481
that's half a million touches
across 50 miles, and at times

76
00:04:17,481 --> 00:04:18,921
the pain is just too much.

77
00:04:18,921 --> 00:04:21,321
The back of my left knee
has just seized up.

78
00:04:21,321 --> 00:04:22,361
It's really, really painful.

79
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:24,681
I can't even move.

80
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:28,601
So I've had to stop
and massage it out.

81
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,721
I was in pain but I feel a little
bit lighter actually.

82
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:34,121
It's good to know we've got
supplies in the van.

83
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:42,081
We'll just see how it goes.

84
00:04:45,321 --> 00:04:50,201
Back on the move and John Farnworth
completed his challenge in just 48

85
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:52,041
hours to raise money for charity.

86
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,681
Time to put your feet
up, John, I think.

87
00:04:54,681 --> 00:05:01,721
Grab a cuppa and settle down
in front of Kickabout.

88
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:05,321
And talking of charity challenges.

89
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:08,201
it's Sport Relief on Friday
when loads of you will be putting

90
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:11,441
on your PE kit and getting
sporty for good causes.

91
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:14,321
So we want to hear from you about
what you've got planned.

92
00:05:14,321 --> 00:05:18,401
Head to the Newsround website to let
us know what you'll be doing.

93
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,801
Just take a look at this view.

94
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:23,881
You're seeing one

95
00:05:23,881 --> 00:05:25,521
of the world's highest
outdoor sky decks.

96
00:05:25,521 --> 00:05:27,441
It's just opened its
doors in New York.

97
00:05:27,441 --> 00:05:30,321
The mega platform is on the 100th
floor of a new skyscraper

98
00:05:30,321 --> 00:05:32,721
in the heart of New York City
in the US.

99
00:05:32,721 --> 00:05:35,601
Visitors can walk over this glass
floor and if you're feeling brave

100
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:38,481
you can even take a selfie
with the rest of the city

101
00:05:38,481 --> 00:05:39,521
as your backdrop.

102
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:40,961
That's all from us for now.

103
00:05:40,961 --> 00:05:43,841
Head online for loads more including
the Harry Potter book that

104
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:46,241
sold for a fortune and
everything you need to know

105
00:05:46,241 --> 00:05:54,201
about Little Mix's new talent show.
