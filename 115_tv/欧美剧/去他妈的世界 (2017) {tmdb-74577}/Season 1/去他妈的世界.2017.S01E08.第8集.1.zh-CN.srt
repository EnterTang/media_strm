1
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,000
两年前

2
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,560
很多时候 当生命中重要的事情发生的时候
A lot of the time, you don't register

3
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,040
你并没有意识到它的重要性
the important moments in your life as they happen.

4
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,200
只有当你回头看的时候 你才发现它的重要性
You only see that they were important when you look back.

5
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,600
去他妈的安全带
Fuck seat belts.

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,720
我们怎么办
What should we do?

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,400
我们要在附近找个地方  舒服点的地方住下来
We need to find somewhere nearby, somewhere nice.

8
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,760
我的老天
Holy shit.

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,970
私闯民宅来保持低调你觉得合适吗
Is breaking and entering the best way of lying low?

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,840
我觉得就是他了 这个房子的主人
I think that's him, the guy that lives here.

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,760
我们可以在这里休息一下 不用着急
We can just chill here, take our time.

12
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,880
有时候我觉得James是值得爱的男孩子 真爱的那种
Sometimes James feels like a boy I could love, like, really love.

13
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,760
和Alyssa在一起让我开始有感觉了
Being with Alyssa had started to make me feel things.

14
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,840
- 你怎么进来的 - 拜托 不要
- How did you get in here? - Please don't.

15
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,280
他当时要伤害你 Alyssa
He was going to hurt you, Alyssa.

16
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,560
快他妈的开车
Fucking drive!

17
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,080
是我杀了他 她什么都没做
I killed him. She didn't do anything.

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,080
- 出发 - 告诉他们都是我一个人干的
- Move! - Tell them that I did it all.

19
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,080
这样你就会没事了
Then you'll be okay.

20
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,920
- 武装警察 - James
- Armed police! - James!

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,500
现在

22
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,360
情不知所起 一往而深
#  My love has no beginning My love has no end  #

23
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,520
爱若磐石 我心斐然
#  No front or back And my love won't bend  #

24
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,280
左右为难
#  I'm in the middle  #

25
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,400
碾转反侧
#  Lost in a spin  #

26
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,800
一往情深
#  Loving you...  #

我们在一个班上
We were in the same class.

32
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,600
我之前一直带着一个医用眼罩

好吧
Right.

46
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,200
扯淡
Shit.

47
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,960
我差点信了
You properly got me there.

48
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,520
被你骗了
You got me.

49
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,920
- 你的幽默感总是很古怪 - 是的

我有多开心
#  How glad I am...  #

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
去他妈的世界

56

我很小的时候就明白了什么是惩罚

你这是在打我的脸
I feel like you've punched me in the face.

65
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,120
我妈妈一直想让我上大学
My mum always wanted me to go to university.

66
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,560
她没去成 因为怀孕了
She couldn't go because she got pregnant.

67
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,600
怀了我
With me.

68
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,040
她总是把我放在第一位

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,120
鳕鱼
Cod.

这有助于大脑发育

爸爸花很多时间打理院子

我17岁时 他失业了
When I was 17, he lost his job.

74
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,640
他不想告诉我们 所以他每天都照常上车
He didn't want to tell us, so every day he got in the car

75
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,000
开着转悠直到下班时间才回家
and drove around until it was time to come home.

76
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,440
当我妈发现的时候 她非常生气
When Mum found out, she was quite upset.

77
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,040
你是我的天使
#  You are my special angel  #

78
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,520
来自天堂
#  Right from paradise...  #

79
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,880
过了不久爸爸就离开了
Dad left soon after that.

80
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,320
我
I'm...

81
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,680
就是去弄点牛奶
just getting some milk.

82
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,920
妈妈说我们俩没有他会过的更好
Mum said we were better off without him.

83
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,040
妈妈
Mum?

84
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,960
这表示她可以把所有的精力都投入在我身上
It meant she could focus all her energy on me.

85
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,680
你从哪儿弄来这个的

86
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,880
我找到的
I found it.

87
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,000
你知道什么样的女人才戴这种东西吗

00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,000
- 我可以留着这个吗 - 不行

103
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,280
我18岁的时候 所有的考试都挂科了

你也是这儿的学生吗
You a student here as well?

111

有时一个不经意间的决定导致的后果会不堪设想

112

我看见一个画面

117
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,520
它在云端出现
#  It was reaching through the clouds  #

118
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,440
像一个梦境
#  To risk a dream  #

119
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,720
影子划过天际
#  The shadow crossed the sky  #

120
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,840
狠狠的砸向地面
#  And it crushed into the ground  #

121
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,840
像一个怪兽
#  Just like a beast  #

122
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,120
那老男人又回来了
#  The old man's back again  #

123
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,120
那老男人又回来了
#  The old man's back again...  #

124
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,520
我可以借用一下吗
Uh, may I?

125
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,760
这是你们这学期的教科书
This is your textbook for the term.

126
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,640
别动
Don't move.

127
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,600
我们开始吧
Let's begin.

128
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,520
Foucault很丢人
Foucault is an embarrassment.

129
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,800
他没有地位
He has no class.

130
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,360
自由 是你对自己所经历的事采取的应对方式
"Freedom is what you do with what's been done to you."

131
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,440
Sartre
Sartre.

132
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,560
做你自己人生的主角
Be the protagonist in your own story.

133
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,920
这个故事以知识分子的反抗行动开始
And that story begins with an act of intellectual defiance.

134
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,920
读一下Max Weber和Erving Goffman的书
Read Max Weber, Erving Goffman.

135
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,320
如果你想要更现代一些的观点

136
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,560
这个人也不错
this guy's pretty good.

137
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,440
你不是学生 对吗
You're not a student, are you?

138
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,720
你只是在这里工作
You just work here.

139
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,400
人们争取到了来上我的课的权利
People have earned the right to come to my class.

140
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,440
而你没有
You haven't.

141
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,440
我不想再看到你 明白了吗
I don't want to see you again. Okay?

142
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,760
有时人们看不到你的潜力
Sometimes people don't see your potential.

143
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,160
所以你必须展示出来
So you have to show them.

144
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,800
是你干的吗
Was this you?

145
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,120
这是屎吗
Is this human shit?

146
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,840
是的
Yeah.

147
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,320
你的吗
Yours?

148
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
也许
Maybe.

149
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,640
你可以来上我的课 不过有个条件
You can come to my class... on one condition.

150
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,560
什么
What?

151
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,520
你陪我出去喝点酒
You have a drink with me.

152
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,440
每周一次
Once a week.

153
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,040
好的
Okay.

154
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,360
终于 我看到了自己的未来
Finally, I could see a future for myself.

155
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,160
这感觉不错
And it felt good.

156
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,040
我找到一个魅力之都
#  I found a place full of charms  #

157
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,040
是宝贝臂弯里的魔法世界
#  A magic world in my baby's arms...  #

158
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,120
去吧
Go ahead.

159
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:53,400
她柔软的拥抱像绸缎和蕾丝
#  Her soft embrace like satin and lace  #

160
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,240
奇妙的地方
#  A wondrous place  #

161
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,200
我们不再疑心
#  We're above suspicion  #

162
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,320
你和我
#  Both you and I  #

163
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,080
他们说我是个好姑娘
#  They say that I'm a good girl...  #

164
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,000
坐
Take a seat.

165
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,640
而我是个好男人
#  And that I'm a good guy  #

166
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,120
你喜欢这个吗
Do you like this?

167
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,640
不太喜欢
Not really.

168
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,280
那...
So...

169
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,880
跟我说说你自己吧
Tell me about yourself.

170
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,640
不
No.

171
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,720
好吧
Okay.

172
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,880
为什么你想要来上我的课
Why did you want to take my class?

173
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,320
感兴趣
I was interested.

174
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,080
对什么感兴趣
In what?

175
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,520
对人生的意义
In what the point is...

176
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,800
对一切
of anything.

177
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,880
那你为什么不上学
Why aren't you a student?

178
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,680
- 你很聪明 - 我挂科了
- You're clearly bright. - Failed my exams.

179
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,640
考试就是区分不同程度的平庸 仅此而已
Exams rank different levels of mediocrity, that's all.

180
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,720
出色的人考试都考不好
Exceptional people don't do well at them.

181
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,840
我就考不好
I didn't.

182
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,400
你很漂亮
You are very pretty.

183
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,880
你知道吗
Do you know that?

184
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,440
有人告诉过你吗
Do people tell you that?

185
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,680
你是条小三文鱼 对吗
You're a little salmon, aren't you?

186
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,640
什么
What?

187
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,560
你想要逆流而上
You want to swim against the tide.

188
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,400
我们要不把衣服脱了吧
Should we take our clothes off?

189
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,400
打个车吧
Take a taxi.

190
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,320
谢谢
Thank you.

191
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,240
你知道吗
Do you know something?

192
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,080
什么
What?

193
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,400
我可能会爱上你
I could fall in love with you.

194
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,960
他像铅一样沉重 宝贝
#  He's as heavy as a lead weight, baby  #

195
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,640
他像线般纤细
#  He's as skinny as a wire...  #

196
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,760
那事已经发生了吗
Has it happened yet?

197
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,840
什么
What?

198
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,520
爱上我
The love.

199
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,560
快了
Nearly.

200
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,480
但我们今天晚上就到这
But we're finished for tonight.

201
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,480
他像一个妖术娃娃
#  He's got a heavy kinda hoodoo, baby  #

202
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,560
他会诅咒你
#  And he can lay it on you  #

203
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,800
他会把诅咒说的好像
#  He can say it like...  #

204
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:39,840
我给出了我的真心
#  I gave you my heart  #

205
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:47,680
在很久很久以前
#  Long, long ago  #

206
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,400
我已经收不回来
#  I can't take it back  #

207
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,560
亲爱的 知道吗
#  Darling, you know...  #

208
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,600
你待我不好
#  How you treat me mean  #

209
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,160
我要还这几本书 然后借这几本
Just, uh, returning these and getting this one out.

210
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,440
这个真的很棒
This is really good.

211
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,280
是啊 这是我最喜欢的
Yeah, it's my favourite.

212
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,320
嗯
Yeah.

213
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,600
你说德语吗
So you speak German then?

214
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,520
- 是的 - 太棒了
- Yeah. - Oh, cool.

215
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,360
好吧
Okay.

216
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,400
很好
Great.

217
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,920
谢谢
Thanks.

218
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,560
这人是谁
Who was that?

219
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,280
他想要做我男朋友
He wants to be my boyfriend.

220
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,000
他约我明天晚上去吃芝士火锅
He asked me to a fondue night tomorrow.

221
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,760
那你要去吗
Are you gonna go?

222
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,600
我喜欢芝士
I like cheese.

223
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,520
我想给你拍些照片
I'd like to take some photographs of you.

224
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,680
什么
What?

225
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,400
明天晚上来找我吧
Come and see me tomorrow night.

226
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,360
今晚怎么样
How about tonight?

227
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,880
今晚不行
I can't do tonight.

228
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,440
当你想要什么的时候
When you want something,

229
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,480
等待就很漫长
it's hard to wait.

230
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,560
你会失去耐心
You can get impatient.

231
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,400
她是谁
Who is she?

232
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,000
- 噢 我不想让你担心 - 什么
- Oh, I didn't want to worry you. - What?

233
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,040
我只在课堂上见过她
I'd only seen her in lectures.

234
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,200
我都不知道她的名字
I didn't know her name

235
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,280
后来 几周前她来找我
until she came to see me a couple of weeks ago.

236
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,720
我太蠢了
I was stupid.

237
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,160
居然同意和她单独谈谈
Agreeing to talk to her alone.

238
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,920
她说她很担心她的考试
She said she was worried about her exams.

239
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,680
我相信她了
I believed her.

240
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,600
她很明显是爱上我了
She's clearly in love with me.

241
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,440
然后想着她又编一些谎话
And now she's made up these lies.

242
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,480
她威胁我
She's threatening me.

243
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,000
她要告诉大家我侵犯了她 她想要毁了我
She's gonna say I attacked her. She wants to destroy me.

244
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,760
毁了我的生活 我的事业 所有的一切
My life, my work. Everything.

245
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,080
这姑娘疯了
The girl's mad.

246
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,120
所以那些话都不是真的
So it isn't true?

247
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,440
你怎么可以问我这样的问题
How can you ask me that?

248
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,360
- 不 不是 我不是这个意思 - 滚出去
- No, look, I didn't... - Get out.

249
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,160
滚出去
Get out!

250
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,200
爱能让你清楚的知道什么是对什么是错
Love makes you feel quite clear about what is right and what is wrong.

251
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,360
当有人做错了事情时 就要受到惩罚
And when someone has done something wrong, they have to get punished.

252
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,440
噢
#  Ooh  #

253
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,280
顺着路一直走
#  Walk down a road  #

254
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,280
和我一起走
#  With me  #

255
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,360
走出去
#  Walking out  #

256
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,840
我就在这里
#  I'm here for  #

257
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:12,160
从我的脑海中消失
#  Getting out of my head  #

258
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,160
为了更好的开始
#  Making plans for a better  #

259
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,440
做一个计划
#  Beginning  #

260
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,520
我需要急救车
Ambulance.

261
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,040
这里发生了意外
There's been an accident.

262
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:40,340
它发生了
我爱上了你
Clive

263
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:42,080
这条路很长
#  It's a long road...  #

264
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,200
你之前让我跟你聊聊我自己的事情
You asked me to tell you about myself that time,

265
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,120
我说了不
and I said no.

266
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,920
我现在想要告诉你了
I want to tell you now.

267
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,280
我从很小的时候就明白了什么是惩罚
I learnt about punishment from a young age.

268
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,280
而且我知道惩罚是出于爱
I learnt it happens because of love.

269
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,280
我以前一直觉得我可能不是真实存在的
I used to feel like I maybe wasn't real.

270
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,560
就好像我是凭空捏造出来的一样
Like I was made up of nothing.

271
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,800
但坠入爱河之后 空虚感逐渐
But when you fall in love, the nothing feeling

272
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,720
被有些感觉给吞噬
is eaten by a something feeling,

273
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,960
或者说 被所有的感觉给吞噬
which is eaten by an everything feeling.

274
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,720
你吞噬了我
You swallowed me,

275
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,840
让我自由了
and set me free.

276
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,160
你怎么知道这里是安全的
How do you know that this one is safe?

277
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,600
没有明显的监控摄像头
No obvious burglar alarm.

278
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,880
到处都是灰尘 所以应该没有清洁工会来
Dust everywhere, so no cleaner to worry about.

279
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,400
邮件
Post.

280
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,080
至少有一个星期的量了
At least a week's worth.

281
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,400
私闯民宅来保持低调你觉得合适吗
Is breaking and entering the best way of lying low?

282
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:54,200
飞离
#  Fly away  #

283
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,280
什么
What?

284
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,200
情不知所起 一往而深
#  My love has no beginning My love has no end  #

285
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,400
爱若磐石 我心斐然
#  No front or back And my love won't bend  #

286
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,760
左右为难
#  I'm in the middle  #

287
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,200
碾转反侧
#  Lost in a spin  #

288
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,640
一往情深
#  Loving you  #

289
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,040
而你不知 不知 不知

嗨
Hi.

00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,840
Alyssa在吗
Is Alyssa in?

292
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,000
爱比天高 爱比海深
#  My love has no bottom My love has no top  #

293
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,560
高出天际 深入海底
#  My love won't rise And my love won't drop  #

294
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,640
左右为难
#  I'm in the middle  #

295
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,360
无从终止
#  And I can't stop  #

296
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,520
一往情深
#  Loving you  #

297
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,040
而你不知 不知 不知
#  And you don't know, you don't know You don't know, you don't know...  #

298
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,760
吾心欣然
#  How glad I am  #

299
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,760
