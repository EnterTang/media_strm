是的
Yes.

抱歉  我感觉不太好

你知道你身在何处吗
Do you know where you are?

10
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,900
我在梦里
I'm in a dream.

11
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,430
没错  德洛丽丝  你在梦里
That's right, Dolores. You're in a dream.

12
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,120
你想从梦里醒来吗
Would you like to wake up from this dream?

13
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,680
是的
Yes.

14
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,350
我很害怕
I'm terrified.

15
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,010
没什么可怕的  德洛丽丝
There's nothing to be afraid of, Dolores,

16
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,360
只要你答对我的问题就可以了
As long as you answer my questions correctly.

17
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,110
-明白了吗  -是的
- Understand? - Yes.

18
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:31,630
很好
Good.

19
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,030
第一个问题
First...

20
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,870
你是否质疑过你眼中现实世界的本质
Have you ever questioned the nature of your reality?

21
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,490
没有
No.

22
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,000
告诉我  你对你的世界的看法
Tell us what you think of your world.

23
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,820
有人选择看到这个世界上的丑恶

24
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,730
那些无秩序的混乱

25
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,970
我选择看到美好
I choose to see the beauty.

26
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,270
早上好  爸爸  睡得好吗
Morning, daddy. You sleep well?

27
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,770
很好
Well enough.

28
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,530
你要出去写生吗
You headed out to set down some of this natural splendor?

29
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,690
是的
Thought I might.

30
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:21,590
我相信我们的生命有着某种秩序
To believe there is an order to our days,

31
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,540
某个目标
A purpose.

32
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,080
你对客人有什么看法
What do you think of the guests?

33
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,010
你是说新住民吗
You mean the newcomers?

34
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,690
第一次来的时候我全程演个好人
Now, the first time I played it white hat.

35
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:37,780
我家人也一起来了
My family was here.

36
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,650
我们一起去钓鱼  去山里淘金
We went fishing, did the gold hunt in the mountains.

37
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,390
-上一次呢  -一个人来的
- And last time? - I came alone.

38
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,370
变身大魔头
Went straight evil.

39
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,710
那是我一生中最棒的两个星期
It was the best two weeks of my life.

40
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,430
我记得父亲对我的教导
I like to remember what my father taught me.

41
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,280
在某个时刻
That at one point or another,

42
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,540
我们都是这个世界的新住民
we were all new to this world.

43
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,890
那些新住民跟我们一样  只是为了寻找
The newcomers are just looking for the same thing we are--

44
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,500
一个自由的地方
A place to be free

45
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,990
一个可以界定梦境
to stake out our dreams,

46
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,130
有着无限可能的地方
a place with unlimited possibilities.

47
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,230
老天  这真是太不可思议了
Oh, god, it's incredible.

48
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,720
当然要物超所值
Better be for what we're paying.

49
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,620
心狠手辣的杀人犯赫克托・艾斯卡顿
Murderous son of a bitch named Hector Escaton

50
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,550
枪杀了警察局长
gunned down the marshal.

51
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,560
躲去山里了
He's holed up in the mountains.

52
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,740
你
You there.

53
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,970
你看起来是个有勇气的小伙子
You look like the kind of man who'd put his mettle to it.

54
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,160
今天可不行  治安官  抱歉
Not today, sheriff. Apologies.

55
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,360
黑麦威士忌
Rye whiskey.

56
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,120
干嘛
What about it?

57
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,090
装在瓶子里没人喝也没什么用
Well, it ain't doing any good sitting in that bottle.

58
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:51,730
你是新来的
You're new.

59
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,460
细皮嫩肉的
Not much of a rind on you.

60
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,960
给你打个折吧
I'll give you a discount.

61
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,290
无意冒犯  不过
Well, no offense, but...

62
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,040
我更情愿赢得女士的芳心  而不是花钱买
I'd rather earn a woman's affection than pay for it.

63
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,790
爱情总归是要花钱的  亲爱的
You're always paying for it, darling.

64
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,150
区别在于  我们的收费
The difference is our costs

65
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,370
是明码标价挂在门前的
are fixed and posted right there on the door.

66
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:23,160
你觉得你的世界里有矛盾吗
Do you ever feel inconsistences in your world?

67
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,920
有反复吗
Or repetitions?

68
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,760
每个生命都有其特定的轨道
All lives have routine.

69
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,590
我的并没有什么不同
Mine's no different.

70
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,760
然而  我总是止不住好奇
Still, I never cease to wonder at the thought

71
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,470
会不会有那么一天  一次机缘巧合
that any day the course of my whole life

72
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,000
就会改变我整个人生的方向
could change with just one chance encounter.

73
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,090
别管我
Don't mind me.

74
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,470
只是想表现下骑士风度
Just trying to look chivalrous.

75
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,220
你回来了
You came back.

76
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,970
我说过我会回来的
I told you I would.

77
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:56,950
我能送你回家吗
Can I see you home?

78
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:00,120
那得看你跟不跟得上了
Well, that all depends. Can you keep up?

79
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,170
我还得去牵我的马
Well, I have to fetch my horse.

80
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,880
那你最好快一点
Better fetch him fast.

81
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,240
景色真美
That's a beautiful sight.

82
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,620
一直不明白
Never understood how you

83
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,440
你怎么能让它们都往一个方向走
keep them all headed in the same direction.

84
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,900
我忘了你是一个光装相
I forget you dress like a cowboy,

85
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,830
不放牛的牛仔
but that's about the extent of it.

86
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:51,940
看见那头了吗
See that one?

87
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,860
-嗯  -那是头牛朱达斯
- Yeah. - That's the Judas steer.

88
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,820
你让他去哪儿  牛群都会跟着过去
Rest will follow wherever you make him go.

89
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,330
你是怎么把它选出来的
How do you pick him out?

90
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,450
知道点技巧罢了
Just know these things.

91
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,710
就像我还知道你一定会回来的
Same as I knew you'd be back.

92
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,260
你是说我很好猜
You saying I'm predictable?

93
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,140
每个人都有自己的路
There's a path for everyone.

94
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,730
你的路指引你回到我身边
Your path leads you back to me.

95
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,970
我知道万物皆有定数
I know things will work out the way they're meant to.

96
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,520
就像我还知道爸爸看到你会不高兴
Same as I know my daddy still won't be happy to see you.

97
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,190
父亲不会这么晚让它们在外边乱跑的
Father wouldn't let them roam this close to dark.

98
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,900
待着别动  德洛丽丝
Stay put, Dolores.

99
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,410
你这里除了牛奶
Ain't you got anything out here

100
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:16,460
就没有别的了吗  老头
Other than milk, old man?

101
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,710
动手吧
Go ahead.

102
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,500
我不急着去见阎王
I'm in no rush to meet my judgment,

103
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:25,520
但我很清楚你将面临的下场  你这混...
but I'm more sure of the outcome than you, you son of a--

104
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,620
那就是只有牛奶了
Nothing but milk, then.

105
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,650
真可惜  我们都没来得及上
Shame of it is you killed the old woman

106
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,530
你就把那老女人杀了
before any of us could have a turn.

107
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,300
我看她还暖和着呢
I reckon she's still warm enough.

108
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,120
没人会说三道四的
Nobody gonna judge you for it.

109
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,610
该死  该死  该死
Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit.

110
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,000
最后一个问题  德洛丽丝
Last question, Dolores.

111
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,570
如果我告诉你  你是错的呢
What if I told you that you were wrong?

112
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,640
这里没有什么机缘巧合
That there are no chance encounters?

113
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,730
你  和你熟知的每一个人
That you and everyone you know

114
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,670
都是被创造出来为那些
were built to gratify the desires

115
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,120
花钱来到你们世界的人们满足欲求的
of the people who pay to visit your world?

116
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,380
爸爸
Daddy!

117
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,370
爸爸
Daddy!

118
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,020
爸爸  不
Daddy! No!

119
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,990
那些人被你叫做"新住民"
The people you call "The newcomers."

120
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,140
又见面了
Hello again.

121
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,010
你爸爸放弃得真快
Your daddy gave it up quickly.

122
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,870
感觉他越来越差劲了
Think he's losing his touch.

123
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,690
你就要随他而去了  你这混蛋
You'll be following right behind him, you son of a bitch.

124
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,400
这就是你对待老朋友的方式吗
Is that any way to treat an old friend?

125
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,510
我来这里反复三十年了
I've been coming here for 30 years,

126
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,830
但是你依然不记得我  是不是
But you still don't remember me, do you?

127
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,580
我们一起经历过那么多
After all we've been through.

128
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,610
他们给你增加了点勇气  德洛丽丝
They gave you a little more pluck, Dolores.

129
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,100
真是太迷人了
Absolutely charming.

130
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,280
别用你的脏手碰她
Take your hands off her.

131
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,230
泰迪
Oh, Teddy.

132
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,200
学了什么新招数吗
Any special tricks for us?

133
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:33,720
他们教了你坐直  还是作揖讨食
They teach you to sit up, beg?

134
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:40,020
不如我让你先开枪吧
How about I give you the first shot, hmm?

135
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:44,030
毕竟  死狗也有翻身的时候
After all, every dog has his day.

136
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,590
你的嘴巴倒是动得挺快
Well, your mouth move fast enough.

137
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,120
不知你的枪如何
How about your gun?

138
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,620
如果我告诉你  你不能伤害新住民
What if I told you that you can't hurt the newcomers?

139
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,520
而他们可以对你为所欲为呢
And that they can do anything they want to you?

140
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:17,350
我从不明白他们为什么要把你们配成一对
I never understood why they paired some of you off.

141
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,240
看起来挺残酷的
Seems cruel.

142
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,950
然后我明白了
And then I realized

143
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,890
胜利要建立在别人输掉的基础上才有意义
winning doesn't mean anything unless someone else loses.

144
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,660
也就是说  你注定要成为输家
Which means you're here to be the loser.

145
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:41,910
我来帮你一把吧  孩子
Let me help you, son.

146
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,320
看起来你不是你以为的那种人
Seems you're not the man you thought you were.

147
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,260
来吧  美人
Come on, beautiful.

148
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,900
不不  不要
Oh, no! No!

149
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,980
泰迪  泰迪
Teddy! Teddy!

150
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:19,230
不不不  求你别伤害他
No, no, no, please don't hurt him.

151
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,760
你要什么我都愿意做
I'll do whatever you say.

152
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:24,250
我花这么多钱可不是为了简简单单取胜
I didn't pay all this money 'cause I want it easy.

153
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,840
我想要你反抗
I want you to fight.

154
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,480
不准碰她
Don't you touch her!

155
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,120
该死的  回来这里的感觉真棒
God damn, feels good to be back.

156
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,820
咱们去庆祝吧
Let's celebrate.

157
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:47,390
不  不要
No! Don't!

158
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,960
不  不要
Oh, no, no!

159
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,520
不要
No!

160
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,350
我告诉你的这些事
Would the things I told you

161
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,920
有没有让你改变对新住民的看法  德洛丽丝
change the way you think about the newcomers, Dolores?

162
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,240
不要
No!

163
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,250
没有
No.

164
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,180
当然没有
Of course not.

165
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,580
我们都喜爱新住民
We all love the newcomers.

166
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,780
我遇到的每个新的人
Every new person I meet

167
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,460
都提醒着我  能活着是多么幸运
reminds me how lucky I am to be alive...

168
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,260
这个世界是多么美好
...and how beautiful this world can be.

169
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,770
天啊  他们可真鲜活
Oh, my god, they're so lifelike.

170
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:43,090
看看那个  他简直完美
Look at that one. He's perfect.

171
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,640
完美等于无聊
Perfect is boring.

172
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,870
我对坏人更感兴趣
I'm more interested in the bad guys.

173
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,150
看到了吗
Did you see it?

174
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,450
没有
No.

175
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,130
再等等  她还会重复
Give it a second. She'll do it again.

176
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,240
她的手指  那不是标准配置手势
Her finger. That's not standard.

177
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,550
我昨晚就注意到了
I noticed it last night.

178
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,700
于是去查了更新文件
Went looking in the update.

179
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,570
是一套新型的手势
It's a whole new class of gestures.

180
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:35,750
可如果不是我们设置的  那会是谁
But if we didn't put it there, then who did?

181
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,790
福特  他在我们发布更新前还是会一一检查
Ford. He still reviews every update before we issue them.

182
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,240
肯定是他没告诉别人偷偷加进去的
He must have slipped it in there without telling anyone.

183
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,140
他管那叫"冥思"
He calls them "Reveries."

184
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,400
以前的手势只是一般的动作
The old gestures were just generic movements.

185
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,210
-这些是绑定了特定记忆的  -怎么可能
- These are tied to specific memories. - How?

186
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,750
记忆会在每个叙事环结束后被清除
The memories are purged at the end of every narrative loop.

187
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,010
但数据还在  等着被覆盖重写
But they're still in there, waiting to be overwritten.

188
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,820
他找到了方法对它们进行提取
He found a way to access them,

189
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:01,730
就像某种潜意识
Like a subconscious.

190
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,100
一个有深度的妓女
A hooker with hidden depths?

191
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,370
所有男人的梦想啊
Every man's dream.

192
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,450
就是这些小细节让他们显得真实
It's the tiny things that make them seem real,

193
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,590
让游客爱上他们
That make the guests fall in love with them.

194
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,190
失陪
Excuse me.

195
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,710
出问题了吗
We have a problem?

196
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,140
我们监测到某种非既定活动
We have some unscheduled activity.

197
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,560
显然  你的一个作品不太安分
Evidently, one of your creatures is restless.

198
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,290
在园区里吗
In the park?

199
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:10,230
不  在冷藏库  地下83层
No, sublevel 83, cold storage.

200
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:11,880
我们该谨慎处理
We should be cautious.

201
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,910
派个应急小队过去  要全副武装
Send a response team, full armor.

202
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,170
我会亲自去处理
I'll take care of it myself.

203
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:18,710
我觉得你们跟游客一样享受换装
I think you guys enjoy playing dress up as much as the guests.

204
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,290
接待员没法伤害你们  设定就是如此
The hosts can't hurt you by design.

205
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,160
你家里没有孩子吧  伯纳德
You don't have kids at home, do you, Bernard?

206
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,570
没有
No.

207
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,330
要是你有  你就会知道他们早晚都会叛逆
If you did, you'd know that they all rebel eventually.

208
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,180
你得原谅他们可能有点紧张过度
You'll forgive them for being a little uptight.

209
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,120
每次你的团队运行一次更新
Every time your team rolls out an update,

210
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,130
都有出现重大故障的可能性
There's a possibility of a critical failure.

211
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,750
我们又不会更新冷藏库里的接待员
We don't update the hosts in cold storage

212
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,310
园区也有三十年没出现过重大故障了
And the park hasn't had a critical failure in over 30 years.

213
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,650
早该出故障了
Meaning we're overdue.

214
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,230
我也去  如果是我的作品  我也许能帮上忙
I'll go along, too. If it's one of mine, I might be able to help.

215
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,890
他们正常运作的时候才是你的  伯尼
They're only yours until they stop working, Bernie.

216
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,650
否则他们就是我的
Then they're mine.

217
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:13,440
{\an8}地下83层


218
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,790
制冷系统已经坏了几周了
Cooling system's been down for weeks.

219
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:24,480
气味肯定不错  我建议你退后点
Gonna smell fantastic. I recommend you hang back.

220
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,620
他们什么时候会修好
When are they gonna fix this?

221
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,920
牲畜管理部门还有其他更重要的事
Livestock management's got other priorities.

222
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,830
而且
Besides...

223
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,600
这里又没人抱怨
No one's complained.

224
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,060
敬穿白鞋的女士
Here's to the lady with the white shoes.

225
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:37,310
卷走了所有的钱  还喝光了所有的酒
Take all your money, drink all your booze.

226
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,550
别
Stop.

227
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,640
除非你打算把老板也废了
Unless you plan to decommission the boss.

228
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,340
没能守身如玉  那算不上罪过
ain't got a cherry, that ain't no sin.

229
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,480
至少身子还在
She's still got the box that the cherry come in.

230
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,490
我要为此喝一杯
I'll drink to that.

231
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,890
辛辣酒
The old coffin varnish.

232
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,890
{\an8}西部酒吧用威士忌与松节油/氨水/火药/辣椒粉调的重口酒


233
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,770
他们现在已经不做了
They don't make that like they used to.

234
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,740
现在什么都比不上从前了
They don't make anything like they used to.

235
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,250
没错  人也一样
Damn right. Men neither.

236
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,140
我当年看过几次决战
I've seen a few showdowns in my day.

237
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,990
可比你想的还多
More than you know.

238
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,810
我们为穿白鞋的女士干一杯吧
Shall we drink to the lady with the white shoes?

239
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,080
我们还是为了
Perhaps we better drink to a...

240
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,820
一夜无梦的沉睡干一杯吧
Deep and dreamless slumber.

241
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:46,030
老比尔总是个很好的倾听者
Old Bill here was always a good listener.

242
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,690
他是我们造的第二个接待员
He was the second host we ever built.

243
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,730
那时候你来了吗  伯纳德
Were you with us in those days, Bernard,

244
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,380
还是在你来之前了
Or was that before your time?

245
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:55,720
恐怕大部分都在我来之前就被废弃了
Most were decommissioned before I was brought on, I'm afraid.

246
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:00,930
他们一直自我重复  经常坏掉
They repeated themselves, broke down constantly.

247
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:03,860
一次简单的握手就能让他们暴露本质
A simple handshake would give them away.

248
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:07,290
你还会把自己放好吧  比尔
You'll put yourself away again, won't you, Bill?

249
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,430
我看到了新的手势  冥思
I saw the new gestures, the reveries.

250
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,720
很优美
They're beautiful.

251
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:22,470
你这一路来做出的成就
The distance you've traveled from then till now,

252
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:25,100
很了不起
It's remarkable.

253
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,350
算得上是吧
Yeah, that's a word for it.

254
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,510
早上好  爸爸  睡得好吗
Morning, daddy. You sleep well?

255
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,910
很好
Well enough.

256
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,510
你要出去写生吗
You headed out to set down some of this natural splendor?

257
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,730
是的
Thought I might.

258
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,520
当然得等我放完牛
After my errands, of course.

259
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,360
天黑前回来
See you home before dark.

260
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,540
那个枪杀了警察局长的强盗
That bandit who gunned down the

261
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,890
还藏在山里
marshal is still hiding up there in the hills.

262
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:11,530
我已经不是小孩子了  没事的
I'm not a child anymore. I'll be just fine.

263
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,860
我当差的时候
When I was a law man--

264
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,720
没错  爸爸  我知道所有你当差时的事
Yes, daddy, I know all about when you were a law man.

265
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,960
我和所有想追我的男孩子
I know all your stories and

266
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,700
都知道你的那些故事
so does every boy that ever came courting.

267
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:22,580
我知道他们是怎么想的  我也年轻过
I know how boys think. Was one myself once.

268
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:25,570
经常各种酗酒闹事
Given to all manner of drinking and mischief.

269
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,540
那个无法无天的男孩去哪了
Whatever happened to that fearsome ne'er-do-well?

270
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:33,470
他在我成为你父亲的那天消失了
He vanished the day I became your father.

271
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,210
是你造就了今天的我
I am what I am because of you,

272
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:40,020
我也不想成为别的样子
and I wouldn't have it any other way.

273
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,170
我知道  爸爸
I know, daddy.

274
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,860
我会在天黑前回家
I'll be home before dark.

275
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,120
心狠手辣的杀人犯赫克托・艾斯卡顿
Murderous son of a bitch Hector Escaton

276
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,720
枪杀了警察局长
gunned down the marshal.

277
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:10,880
他现在窝藏在山上
He's now holed up in the mountains.

278
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:12,960
这位先生
You there.

279
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,660
你看起来很有勇气
You look like the kind of man who'd put his mettle to it.

280
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,350
你觉得呢  亲爱的
What do you think, honey?

281
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,690
听起来很好玩
Sounds fun.

282
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,300
你是新来的
You're new.

283
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,370
细皮嫩肉的
Not much of a rind on you.

284
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:31,260
给你打个折吧
I'll give you a discount.

285
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,650
无意冒犯  我更情愿赢得女士的芳心
No offense, but I'd rather earn a woman's affection

286
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,530
而不是花钱买
than pay for it.

287
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:52,740
等等  等等  我认识他
Wait, wait, I know that one.

288
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:55,150
泰迪
Hey, Teddy.

289
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,980
上次过来  是这哥们带我参观的
Yeah, last trip, this dude showed me around.

290
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,160
怎么了  泰迪
What's the good word, Teddy?

291
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,060
多谢了
Mighty kind of you.

292
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,380
很甜
Sweet.

293
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,470
但不如你甜
Not as sweet as you.

294
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:36,170
恐怕我今晚另有安排了  德洛丽丝
I'm afraid I've got other plans tonight, Dolores.

295
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,750
祝你今晚愉快
Have a pleasant evening.

296
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:51,640
你是新来的  细皮...
You're new. Not much of a...

297
00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:00,250
请下注  先生们  请下注
Place your bets, gentlemen. Place your bets.

298
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:41,300
看来赫克托往这边逃了
Yeah, looks like Hector's been this way.

299
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,050
你知道还要走多久吗
Any idea how much longer this is gonna take?

300
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,880
我妻子不想在天黑后还在山上
My wife doesn't want to be up here after dark.

301
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,840
我们知道他躲在山上某处
We know he's up in these hills somewhere.

302
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:54,610
他肯定会狠狠和我们干上一场  等我们
He's gonna put up one hell of a fight when we--

303
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,460
等我们  等我们
When we-- when we--

304
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:06,530
治安官
Sheriff?

305
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:12,640
他出毛病了  我要回镇上
Something is wrong with it. I want to head back to town.

306
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,190
马上
Now.

307
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,680
这他妈的什么毛病
What the fuck is wrong with it?

308
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,970
你给他升了级
You updated the guy,

309
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,740
现在他犯了癫痫
and now he's a six-foot gourd with epilepsy.

310
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:32,290
到底他妈的怎么回事
So what the fuck happened?

311
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:33,430
我不知道
I don't know.

312
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,860
这还真是
Well, that's exactly what

313
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,950
我想从编程部门主管嘴里听到的话呢
you want to hear from your head of programming.

314
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:39,270
我们还没完成诊断
We haven't finished the diagnostic yet.

315
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:42,080
很明显机器出现了异常行为
Clearly it's exhibiting some aberrant behavior.

316
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,360
真他妈异常啊  伯尼
Pretty fucking aberrant, Bernie.

317
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,260
你的接待员会生病  迷路
Your hosts get sick, they get lost,

318
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,260
但这可就奇怪了
but this is grotesque.

319
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,850
是升级导致的问题吗
Is it a problem with the update?

320
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,900
有可能  但可能性不大
Possible, but not likely.

321
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:53,850
如果这个版本有问题
If it's the unlikely version,

322
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:56,210
说说你已经升级了多少接待员
how many hosts have you updated so far?

323
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:58,160
差不多10%
Maybe 10% of the population.

324
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:03,080
好吧  弄清问题前把所有升级接待员收回
All right, we pull all updated hosts until we can figure it out.

325
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,840
你他妈的在逗我吗
Are you fucking kidding me?

326
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:09,070
那可是两百个接待员  涉及十几条故事线
That's 200 hosts spread across a dozen active storylines.

327
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:12,090
游客们经常会打断你宝贵的故事情节
The guests interrupt your precious storylines all the time

328
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,420
只要他们想射击或者干什么东西的时候
when they want to shoot or fuck something.

329
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,280
不  那是他们想
No, when they want to.

330
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,170
我们提供的是一百个相互关联的故事
We sell complete immersion

331
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:19,690
沉浸式的旅程
in 100 interconnected narratives.

332
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:22,930
不间断的体验
A relentless fucking experience.

333
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:26,210
你抽掉一个角色  整个故事都要调整
Now, you pull one character, the overall story adjusts.

334
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,490
一次性抽掉两百个  这他妈就是大灾难
You pull 200 at once, and it's a fucking disaster!

335
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:44,200
告诉我哪一半是
Tell me which half is which

336
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,680
我来搜搜那一半
and I'll search that half.

337
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:03,330
那一半会切断你的喉咙的
Yeah, the half that's gonna cut your fucking throat.

338
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,820
我告诉过你  我没...
I told you, I didn't take--

339
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,730
又和新的一样了  是吗
Good as new again, huh?

340
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,940
有时候我很羡慕你能忘记从前
Sometimes I envy your forgetfulness.

341
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,770
有一个接待员出现了严重故障
We've got a serious problem with one of the hosts.

342
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,720
这个人还没喝够呢
Thinking this one's still thirsty.

343
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:01,160
这次不会死了  阿诺德
Not gonna die this time, Arnold.

344
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,170
没什么能杀得了我
Ain't nothing gonna kill me.

345
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:27,120
你们喝不了  这不是给你们的
You can't have none. Ain't for you.

346
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,040
又找到一瓶
Found me another bottle.

347
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:04,070
你在长个  要多喝奶
You're a growing boy.

348
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,610
你在长个
A growing boy.

349
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:12,020
在长个
Growing boy!

350
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,630
里面有两个客人
We got two guests inside.

351
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,210
我去跟他们谈
We'll go talk to them,

352
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,110
你们搞定这个烂摊子
you sort this mess out.

353
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:33,850
他们本就该相互攻击的
You know, they're supposed to turn on each other,

354
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:36,520
但只有在客人把他们带到高能故事情节上的时候
but only if a guest takes them on the high sierra storyline,

355
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,850
沃尔特总会配合
and Walter always buys it.

356
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:42,620
看来沃尔特已经厌倦了
Well, I guess Walter got tired of buying it.

357
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:48,030
这说明治安官的事不是个别事件
I suppose this means the sheriff wasn't an isolated incident.

358
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,610
其实这是个好消息  真的
It's good news, really.

359
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:53,740
证实了问题就是出自于升级
Confirms the problem was part of the update.

360
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,240
我们可以把他们进行滚回操作
We can roll them back,

361
00:39:57,310 --> 00:40:00,200
清理干净  再重新上线
clean them up, put them back in service.

362
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,660
你觉得我会同意
You think I'm gonna sign off

363
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:05,440
让这个谋杀犯重新上线吗
On this fucking homicidal thing going back into service?

364
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,220
本来的设计就是谋杀犯
It's homicidal by design.

365
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:17,820
你想对制造者说些什么
And what do you want to say to your maker?

366
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:27,600
以肮脏龌龊的匠人之手
By most mechanical and dirty hand...

367
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:27,600
{\an8}出自莎士比亚《亨利四世》  梁实秋译本


368
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:50,890
{\an8}出自莎士比亚《李尔王》  梁实秋译本


369
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:40,440
我必对你们痛加报复
I shall have such revenges on you both.

370
01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:43,380
我必定这样做
The things I will do.

371
01:01:43,390 --> 01:01:47,150
究竟做什么我现在还不知道
What they are, yet I know not,

372
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:50,890
不过总是人间可怕的事
but they will be the terrors of the earth.

373
01:01:54,390 --> 01:01:57,760
你不知道自己在哪里吧
You don't know where you are, do you?

374
01:01:59,930 --> 01:02:02,530
这是你自掘的坟墓
You're in a prison of your own sins.

375
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:06,070
关掉它
Turn it off.

376
01:02:14,110 --> 01:02:15,550
那是什么
What the hell was that?

377
01:02:15,550 --> 01:02:18,150
我不知道  他脱离剧本了
I don't know. He's off script.

378
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:20,180
我们没有编写这些行为
We didn't program any of those behaviors.

379
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:26,560
莎士比亚
Shakespeare.

380
01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:32,260
我们不是让这个接待员扮演过很多不同角色吗
We've used this host in a number of different roles, have we not?

381
01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:34,770
自从我来了这里  十年来他一直是艾伯纳西
Since I've been here, he's been Abernathy for 10 years.

382
01:02:34,770 --> 01:02:37,440
在那之前他做了一阵治安官
He was sheriff for a while before then.

383
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:41,170
-再之前是  -教授
- And before that... - The professor.

384
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:31,480
你觉得我们要怎么做
I mean, what do you propose we do?

385
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:34,910
停业吗  发礼品券吗
Close down? Issue fucking gift certificates?

386
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:38,090
你的眉毛很美
It's beautiful-- your brow.

387
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:40,180
当你生气却极力控制的时候  眉毛很美
When you're angry but trying to control it,

388
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,810
肌肉活动使其形成一道弧线
The fine muscles pull into a little arc.

389
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,370
很优美
It's elegant.

390
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,540
我能录下来吗
Would you mind if I recorded it?

391
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,490
我想给我的团队看看
I'd love to show it to my team.

392
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,680
不行  伯纳德  不能录
No, Bernard, you may not record it.

393
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,030
眉毛又动了
Ah, there it is again.

394
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:58,010
园区内有1400名游客
We have 1,400 guests in the park.

395
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:59,950
我需要知道他们是否有危险
I need to know if they're in any danger.

396
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:03,110
他的核心程序很完整
His core code is intact,

397
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,340
也就是说他不会伤害游客
which means he can't hurt a guest.

398
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,040
就连一只苍蝇都不会伤害
He literally couldn't hurt a fly.

399
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,590
他只会...
All he can do is...

400
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:12,180
这么做
...that.

401
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:15,830
好吧  伯尼
All right, Bernie.

402
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,300
进行诊断
Run a diagnostic.

403
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,200
同时  哪怕是一个
In the meantime, there's so much

404
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,190
偏离剧本的小喷嚏  都要告诉我
as an unscripted sneeze, I want to know about it.

405
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:48,150
这地方太他妈疯狂了
This place is fucking wild.

406
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,230
这只是最基本的
This is basic.

407
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,550
第一级
Level one.

408
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:54,390
你出城后
You ride out of town,

409
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,350
真正的疯狂才刚刚开始
that's when the real demented shit begins.

410
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:59,320
那时我朋友泰迪就会登场
That's where my man Teddy comes in.

411
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,480
他就像个导游
He's like a guide.

412
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:03,980
老实说
Honestly,

413
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,200
那家伙让我感觉有点恐怖
the guy kind of creeps me out.

414
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:11,580
管他的  等他带我们出了峡谷
Fuck it, he leads us out in the canyons,

415
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,480
无聊的时候就拿他当靶子练枪好了
we get bored, we just use him for target practice.

416
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,090
我们不应该过河吧
I don't think we're supposed to be cross the river.

417
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,030
雅各布还太小
It's too adult for Jacob.

418
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,480
我们无意打扰您
We didn't mean to bother you.

419
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,080
不算打扰  这里景色很美
No bother at all. It's a beautiful spot.

420
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,690
我一直觉得不该一个人独享
I always found it a shame that I have it all to myself.

421
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,450
它们每天都会来
They come here every day.

422
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:53,210
你想靠近点看吗
Would you like a closer look?

423
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,680
别怕  它们很温顺的
Don't be scared. They're very gentle.

424
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:14,040
给你  手掌摊平
Here, put your hand out real flat.

425
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,470
它们很美吧
They're beautiful, aren't they?

426
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:24,700
你是他们中的一员  对吧
You're one of them, aren't you?

427
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,410
你不是真实的
You're not real.

428
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,470
我得走了  太阳快下山了
I have to go now. Sun's almost down.

429
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:39,060
你们也回吧  山里有强盗
You should, too. There's bandits in these hills.

430
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:55,690
就是这样  驾
Here we go, yah! Yah!

431
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,890
你在等我吗  爸爸
You waiting up for me, daddy?

432
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:45,290
我跟你说了我会在天黑前回来
I told you I'd be home before dark.

433
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,180
我今天在土里发现了这个
I found this in the field today.

434
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,050
我看不出来什么
Doesn't look like anything to me.

435
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:57,600
她这是在哪里
Well, where is she?

436
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:00,500
你见过这种地方吗
Have you ever seen anything like this place?

437
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,330
我看不出来什么
Doesn't look like anything to me.

438
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:09,500
我去帮妈妈准备晚饭了
I'm gonna help mama put supper on.

439
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,090
我跟你想得一样
I had the same thought.

440
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:31,200
睡觉之前得晒晒太阳
Needed a little sunshine before turning in.

441
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:35,050
你下次什么时候轮班回家
So, when do you get to rotate home again?

442
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:38,680
你这么不会聊天
If you're this bad at writing small talk,

443
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,650
到底是怎么得到这份工作的
How the fuck did you get your job?

444
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,600
说重点
Get to the point.

445
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:47,330
如果之前多有冒犯  我向你道歉
I wanted to apologize if I came across as aggressive.

446
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:50,330
还有我想跟你谈谈更新的事
And I wanted to talk to you about the update.

447
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:51,490
问题已经解决了
The problem's been resolved.

448
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:53,890
根本就不该有什么更新
There should never have been an update in the first place.

449
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:57,800
福特和伯纳德一直想把他们弄得更像人类
Ford and Bernard keep making the things more lifelike.

450
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,970
但真的有人想要这样吗
But does anyone truly want that?

451
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:00,910
你想觉得
Do you want to think that your

452
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:03,200
你丈夫真的在上某个漂亮女人吗
husband is really fucking that beautiful girl

453
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,280
还是你真的射杀了某个人
or that you really just shot someone?

454
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,180
正因为游客知道接待员不是真人
This place works because the guests

455
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,200
这里才这么受欢迎
know the hosts aren't real.

456
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,400
你到底想说什么
So what exactly are you suggesting?

457
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:13,170
不要再升级了
Stop the updates altogether.

458
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,280
也许还可以滚回一点
Maybe even roll them back a bit.

459
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,460
让接待员更可控一些
Make the hosts more manageable.

460
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,480
额叶切除手术可以做到
Lobotomies tend to do that.

461
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,530
想想这样的好处吧
Well, think of the benefits

462
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:28,390
在设计时间  维护  成本上
In terms of design time, maintenance, costs.

463
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:31,180
就更不用提福特博士了
Not to mention the dr. Ford factor.

464
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,850
这个人会追随他内心的恶魔直至地狱的深渊
The guy's gonna chase his demons right over the deep end.

465
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,580
我比谁都要敬重他  但是在这点上...
I mean, no one respects him more than me, but at some point--

466
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,770
我  没人比我更敬重他
I. No one respects him more than I.

467
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:44,600
你的代词是第二个分句的主语
Your pronoun is the subject of the second clause.

468
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,510
我是说
I was saying-- -

469
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:47,920
你说的是我们那个无所畏惧的头儿垮了
you were saying should our fearless leader have a breakdown,

470
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,970
你想利用这个往上爬
you want to leverage it for your career.

471
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:53,600
听我说  早就应该换人了
Listen, a changing of the guard is long overdue.

472
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,640
我想你知道  我站在你这边
I just wanted you to know that you have my support

473
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:59,030
而且我知道
and that I know that the

474
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,120
公司对这里的真正兴趣
corporation's real interest in this place

475
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,640
远不止是满足那些
goes way beyond gratifying

476
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,070
想扮演牛仔的有钱混蛋
some rich assholes who want to play cowboy.

477
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,970
我原以为你只擅长
And here I thought you were only good

478
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:13,870
写写下流的幻想剧情
For writing depraved little fantasies.

479
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,160
没错
You're right.

480
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,800
这个地方对客人是一回事
This place is one thing to the guests,

481
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,240
对股东来说又是另一回事
another thing to the shareholders,

482
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:25,160
在管理上又是完全不同的
and something completely different to management.

483
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:27,080
启发启发我
So enlighten me.

484
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:30,570
你觉得管理层真正的兴趣是什么
What do you think management's real interests are?

485
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,600
你够聪明  能看到存在远景
You're smart enough to guess there's a bigger picture,

486
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:40,120
但又不够聪明  看不清楚是什么
but not smart enough to see what it is.

487
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,840
所以你知道你的支持对我来说有什么用吗
You know how much use that makes your support to me?

488
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,030
什么用都没有
Fuck all.

489
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,750
去睡个好觉吧  希斯摩尔先生
Get some sleep, Mr. Sizemore.

490
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:58,680
你明天还要讨好更多的有钱混蛋呢
You'll have more rich assholes to gratify tomorrow.

491
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,030
这么早睡吗  梅芙
Early night, maeve?

492
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:18,200
身体有点不适
Feeling a bit out of sorts.

493
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,300
克莱门汀可以接我的活
Clementine can pick up the slack.

494
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,020
晚安
Night.

495
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,760
忘了什么吗  基西
Forgetting something, Kissy?

496
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,070
我开始觉得你对我有意思了
I'm beginning to think you're getting sweet on me.

497
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,660
那是因为你身上流着一半乡巴佬的血
Well, on account of you being half cornhusker.

498
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,610
沃尔特一直都杀其他的接待员
Walter kills other hosts all the time.

499
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,920
我承认这个模式
I'll admit the method here

500
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,050
有点打破常规
is a little unconventional,

501
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:16,950
但是它没有伤害到客人
but it didn't hurt a guest.

502
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:20,320
接待员理应待在自己的循环中
The hosts are supposed to stay within their loops,

503
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,280
按剧本行事
stick to their scripts

504
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,590
只能有极小的即兴发挥
with minor improvisations.

505
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,840
但这可不是极小的即兴发挥
This isn't a minor improvisation.

506
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,030
这他妈简直是场大灾难
This is a fucking shitstorm.

507
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:34,820
我们明天必须召回所有被更新的接待员
We recall all remaining updated hosts tomorrow.

508
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:38,660
一个个检查  废弃掉残次品
Examine them one by one, decommission the faulty ones.

509
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,210
那整个故事线怎么办
What about narrative?

510
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:42,560
如此大规模的召回  会引发极大的混乱
A recall of that size will be disruptive.

511
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,380
我已经让那位狂暴的朋友
I've told our overstimulated friend

512
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,810
提前一周去洗劫酒吧
to advance the saloon heist a week

513
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,340
并让血腥程度翻倍
and make it twice as bloody.

514
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:50,130
那应该可以帮我们掩盖召回剩余接待员的行动
Should give us cover to recall the remaining hosts.

515
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:52,170
客人们一定会很喜欢的
And the guests will love it.

516
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:54,160
我觉得福特恐怕不会同意吧
I'm not sure Ford will approve.

517
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,160
我也担心他不会同意
I'm not sure either,

518
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:57,830
因此就由你去告诉他吧
which is why you get to be the one to tell him.

519
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,810
这是你搞出的烂摊子  伯尼
This is your fuckup, Bernie.

520
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:03,780
只有这样才公平
Only seems fair.

521
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,050
我们的创造物似乎有些行为失常
So our creatures have been misbehaving,

522
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:20,920
你到现在还没把程序错误筛选出来吗
and you haven't yet isolated the bug?

523
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,060
那可真不像你的风格  伯纳德
That's so unlike you, Bernard.

524
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:28,190
当然  除非你已经解决了
Unless, of course, you have

525
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,430
只不过是结果让你感到很丢人
and are simply embarrassed by the result.

526
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,230
是您添加的代码出了问题  先生
It's the code you added, sir.

527
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:37,210
冥思
The reveries.

528
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,450
它有一些...
It has some...

529
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:41,650
"错误"
"Mistakes"

530
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,080
你觉得很丢人  不想用这个词
Is the word you're too embarrassed to use.

531
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:44,680
你不必觉得丢人
You ought not to be.

532
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,200
你就是千万亿个错误的产物
You're a product of a trillion of them.

533
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:52,100
进化形成了这个星球上有情感和知觉的生命体
Evolution forged the entirety of sentient life on this planet

534
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:56,630
用的唯一的工具  就是错误
using only one tool--the mistake.

535
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,580
我自认为
I flattered myself

536
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,980
我们现在采取的是更专业成熟的做法
we were taking a more disciplined approach here.

537
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:05,370
我猜"自欺"也是自然选择的结果吧
I suppose self-delusion is a gift of natural selection as well.

538
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:06,850
确实如此
Indeed it is.

539
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,960
不过  当然了  我们已经成功地
But, of course, we've managed to

540
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,360
摆脱了进化的束缚  对吧
slip evolution's leash now, haven't we?

541
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:14,010
我们可以治愈任何疾病
We can cure any disease,

542
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:16,000
让我们当中最弱的人也能活命
keep even the weakest of us alive,

543
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,400
或许  将来有一天
and, you know, one fine day

544
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,740
我们甚至能让亡者复生
perhaps we shall even resurrect the dead.

545
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:26,140
就像耶稣将拉萨路复活一样
Call forth Lazarus from his cave.

546
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:31,870
你知道那意味着什么吗
Do you know what that means?

547
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,990
意味着到此结束了
It means that we're done.

548
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:39,240
这就是我们能取得的最好的结果了
That this is as good as we're going to get.

549
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:44,330
也意味着  
It also means that

550
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:49,560
你必须迁就我偶尔的错误
you must indulge me the occasional mistake.

551
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:21,230
大约三公升
About three liters.

552
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:25,980
那就是我给你留下的血液量
That's how much blood I left in you.

553
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:29,130
失血再多一点  你就会死
Lose more than that, you die.

554
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,510
但是眼下  你还在我掌心里
But for now, you're mine.

555
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:34,810
我要从你口中问出一些答案
I'm gonna get some answers out of you.

556
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:42,980
你这是要去...
Where are you--

557
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,570
你想怎么样
What do you want?

558
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,950
你会玩游戏吧  基西
You know about games, don't you, Kissy?

559
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,130
这就是个复杂点的游戏
Well, this is a complicated one.

560
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:22,620
我不玩游戏  我只发牌
I don't play. I only deal.

561
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:25,010
谁说让你玩了
Who said anything about you playing?

562
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,690
你就是牲畜  是布景而已
You're livestock, scenery.

563
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,550
我才是玩家
I play.

564
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:34,440
其他人  只是来发泄一下性欲
The others, they just come here to get their rocks off,

565
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,210
或是杀几个印第安人的
shoot a couple indians.

566
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:40,630
但这个游戏还有更深的层次
But there's a deeper level to this game.

567
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:44,620
你要带我进入那里
You're gonna show me how to get there.

568
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:49,540
古文化中蕴含了太多的智慧
A lot of wisdom in ancient cultures.

569
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,540
或许...
And perhaps it's...

570
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:57,610
是时候挖进你的大脑更深层了
Time to dig deeper into yours.

571
00:44:57,890 --> 00:45:00,500
不  不要
No. No. No.

572
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:14,960
早上好  爸爸  睡得好吗
Morning, daddy. Did you sleep well?

573
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:27,580
爸爸  你在外面坐了一整晚吗
Daddy, you've been out here all night?

574
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:34,830
我有个问题
I had a question.

575
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,880
一个不该问的问题
A question you're not supposed to ask.

576
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:44,310
那让我获知了一个答案
Which gave me an answer

577
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:47,770
一个你不该知道的答案
you're not supposed to know.

578
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,170
怎么了  爸爸
What's wrong, daddy?

579
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:54,090
你想知道...
Would you like to know...

580
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:59,100
那个问题吗
the question?

581
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:01,800
-问...问题吗  -妈妈
- question? - Mama!

582
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:03,960
妈妈  快来帮忙
Mama, help! Come quick!

583
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:06,570
别担心
Don't worry.

584
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:08,950
别担心  我会照顾好你
Don't worry. I'll take care of you.

585
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:15,110
不
No!

586
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:17,830
你该走了  快走
You should go. Leave.

587
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:19,830
你还不明白吗
Don't you see?

588
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:24,180
地狱已空  恶魔倾巢而出  来到了这里
Hell is empty and all the devils are here.

589
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:24,180
{\an8}来自莎士比亚《暴风雨》


590
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:36,080
你待在这别动  明白吗
You stay right here. Understand?

591
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,590
我去找医生
I'm gonna find the doctor.

592
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:21,290
-你回来了  -我说过我会回来的
- You came back. - I told you I would.

593
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:28,070
-怎么了  -你快跟我来
- What's wrong? - You have to come with me right away.

594
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:29,520
我父亲病得很重
My father's very ill.

595
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:56,170
我觉得我们还是先留在原地吧
I think we best stay put.

596
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:04,460
好吧  好吧
All right. All right.

597
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:07,680
经过不眠不休的辛勤工作
With considerable effort and lack of sleep,

598
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,650
我终于设法让赫克托
I've managed to massage events to inspire Hector

599
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:12,430
提前一周来到了镇上
to head to town a week early.

600
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:16,640
我还写好了等他抢劫酒吧后
Oh, and I've also punched up the speech he gives

601
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,530
要说的一段台词
after robbing the saloon.

602
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,680
相当可怕  你到时候就知道了
It's chilling. You'll see.

603
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:23,040
我等不及想知道了
I can barely contain myself.

604
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:46,020
那是治安官的马  你这个混蛋
That's the Sheriff's horse, you son of a bitch.

605
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:50,290
还有他的枪
His rifle, too.

606
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,020
这儿有那么多银行和火车
All the banks and trains around here,

607
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:20,050
你们这群恶棍偏偏要来抢我们
and you fucking reprobates choose to rob us?

608
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:21,380
有何不可
Why not?

609
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:26,760
你们都在这里放纵你们的罪恶
You're all here indulging your particular vices.

610
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,830
所以我也来放纵我自己
And so I've come to indulge mine.

611
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:52,830
我得回去找我父亲
I've got to get back to father.

612
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:54,890
德洛丽丝  不
Dolores, no!

613
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:03,580
泰迪
Teddy.

614
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,420
别担心我
Don't mind me.

615
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,620
只是想...表现下骑士风度
Just-- just trying to look chivalrous.

616
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:18,490
泰迪
Oh, Teddy.

617
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:36,000
你真是个下作的混蛋
You're a low-down son of a bitch.

618
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:37,300
我知道
I know.

619
00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:41,610
我知道我们有一个相同的理念
I know we both believe the same thing.

620
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:48,020
不管活多脏
No matter how dirty the business,

621
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,000
都要做好
do it well.

622
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:14,700
那个保险箱里应该没什么值钱的
No telling there's anything worthwhile in that safe.

623
00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:22,890
我们应该带走这个小贱人
We should take this sweet little bitch

624
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,310
以防万一
just in case.

625
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:43,240
这就是正义的窘境  他们什么都打不中
Problem with the righteous-- they can't shoot for shit.

626
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:46,290
不过倒是特别吵
Making a hell of a racket, though.

627
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:52,400
{\an8}通缉
赫克托・艾斯卡顿

628
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:03,190
你们想抓我
You wanted me.

629
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:06,550
那就给你们上一课吧
Well, let this be a lesson.

630
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:11,600
那就是
The lesson is--

631
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:30,290
天
Oh, jesus.

632
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,630
看  我刚打穿了他的脖子
Look at that! I just shot him through the neck!

633
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,420
还有他的同伙
And his pal here, too.

634
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:45,950
看她抽搐的样子
Look at her wriggle.

635
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:50,180
叫那个摄影师过来
Yo, go get that photographer.

636
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:51,650
我要拍张照
I want to get a picture of this.

637
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:54,700
不客气
You're welcome.

638
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,320
你写的那段台词还是下次再用吧
Maybe you'll get to your speech next time.

639
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:03,740
泰迪
Oh, Teddy.

640
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:09,140
至少我最后又见了你一面
At least I got to see you one last time.

641
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,940
你不准死  听到了吗
You're not going anywhere, now, hear?

642
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:15,650
每个人都有自己的路
There's a path for everyone.

643
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,220
我的路是跟你相连的
My path is bound with yours.

644
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,510
泰迪
Teddy?

645
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:31,630
泰迪  不
Teddy, no.

646
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:33,750
求你了
Please.

647
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,510
不  我们才刚开始
No, we've only just begun.

648
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,180
拍得不错  等等  等等
That was good. Hang on. Hang on.

649
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,900
我戴上帽子拍  等我拿帽子
Let me get the hat. Get the hat.

650
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,000
好了
All right.

651
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:09,200
帮帮我
Help, please.

652
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:10,900
我父亲在家里生病了
My father's sick at home,

653
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:13,430
但我不能就这么把他丢在大街上
but I can't just leave him out here in the street.

654
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:24,890
这很快就会变得像是一场遥远的梦境
Soon this will all feel like a distant dream.

655
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:29,100
在此之前  愿你陷入一夜无梦的沉睡
Until then, may you rest in a deep and dreamless slumber.

656
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:35,860
这里还有两个
Two more over here.

657
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,330
全部找到了
We got them all.

658
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:52,390
全部回收完毕
That's all of them.

659
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,090
有初步结果了吗
Any preliminary results?

660
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:57,000
大部分检查过都没问题
Most of them are checking out fine.

661
00:55:58,810 --> 00:56:00,510
其中有一个
We had one who...

662
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,740
肯定出了问题
definitely was not.

663
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,460
把她唤醒
Bring her back online.

664
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:39,600
留下认知能力  去除情感影响
Cognition only. No emotional affect.

665
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:46,120
亲爱的  听得到我说话吗
All right, sweetheart, can you hear me?

666
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:47,920
是的
Yes.

667
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:50,910
抱歉  我感觉不太好
I'm sorry. I'm not feeling quite myself.

668
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:52,430
去掉口音
Lose the accent.

669
00:56:52,590 --> 00:56:55,560
-你知道你身在何处吗  -我在梦里
- Do you know where you are? - I'm in a dream.

670
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:57,550
没错  德洛丽丝  你在梦里
That's right, Dolores. You're in a dream.

671
00:56:57,550 --> 00:56:59,870
一个也许能决定你人生的梦
A dream that could determine your life.

672
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:02,410
你想从梦里醒来吗  德洛丽丝
You want to wake up from this dream, Dolores?

673
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:04,500
是的
Yes.

674
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,060
我很害怕
I'm terrified.

675
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:08,810
没什么可怕的
There's nothing to be afraid of,

676
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:11,140
只要你答对我的问题就可以了
as long as you answer my questions correctly.

677
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:13,310
-明白了吗   -是的
- You understand? - Yes.

678
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:14,600
很好
Good.

679
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:18,620
第一个问题  你是否质疑过你眼中现实世界的本质
First, have you ever questioned the nature of your reality?

680
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,050
没有
No.

681
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:21,850
你身边的人有过质疑吗
Has anyone around you?

682
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:25,530
比如说你父亲
For instance, your father?

683
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:30,650
他很害怕
He was scared.

684
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:32,610
他的思绪不清晰
He wasn't thinking right.

685
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,190
他给你看了一张照片
He showed you a picture.

686
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:40,440
是的
That's right.

687
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:46,020
这张照片有什么异常的地方吗
Was there anything odd about that picture?

688
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:48,390
完全没有
No, nothing at all.

689
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:51,460
我看不出来什么
It didn't look like anything to me.

690
00:57:57,210 --> 00:57:59,450
如果它违反规定  就要将其撤下
If it breached, he needs to be put down.

691
00:57:59,450 --> 00:58:00,840
政策就是如此
That's the policy.

692
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:05,560
对我们来说  先找出原因不是最好的吗
Would it not be best for us to discover why first,

693
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:06,800
卡伦女士
Ms. Cullen?

694
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:12,850
请吧
Please.

695
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:23,140
我们运行了全面诊断
We've run a full diagnostic,

696
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:26,050
但是结果
but the results are,

697
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:29,050
令人费解
well, confusing.

698
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:34,840
告诉我  你的程序出了什么问题

{\an8}出自莎士比亚《李尔王》  梁实秋译本


700
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:47,570

701
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:47,570
我们便哭
we cry we are come

702
00:58:47,570 --> 00:58:49,360
因为我们来到了这个

703
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:54,290
群丑的台上
of f-f-fools."

00:59:35,290 --> 00:59:38,840
当然是我女儿德洛丽丝

715
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:41,050
我必须保护德洛丽丝

716
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:44,550
是她造就了我

717

我不想成为别的...

我必须警告她

他们对她做的事

他们对她做的事
The things you do to her.

726
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:17,020
我必须保护她

727
01:00:18,330 --> 01:00:19,780

731
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:28,900
这种行为

01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,740
已经远远超出了小故障的范畴

736
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:50,570
玫瑰之所以是玫瑰
Rose is a rose...

737
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
正因为她是玫瑰
is a rose.

738
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:58,800
你的行程是什么
What is your itinerary?

去见我的制造者

740
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,920
你走运了

我承认最后一个年代不太对
I admit the last one is a bit of an anachronism,

748
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:57,390
但我难以抗拒

749
01:02:57,390 --> 01:03:00,220
这些是之前版本的记忆碎片

750
01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:03,260
冥思肯定让他接触了这些记忆碎片

751
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:04,960
没必要紧张  伯纳德
No cause for alarm, Bernard.

752
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:08,600
只是我们过去的作品有些阴魂不散

761
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:43,900
这些话对你有什么意义吗

没有
No.

没有
No.

766
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:59,720
最后一个问题  德洛丽丝

772
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:32,350
你觉得这些不会对她的核心代码产生影响吧
You don't think any of that had an impact on her core code?

773
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:34,000
对亲爱的德洛丽丝不会
Not good old Dolores.

774
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:37,110
你知道她为什么如此特别吧
You know why she's special?

775
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:40,930
她被修理了这么多次  基本上算是崭新的
She's been repaired so many times, she's practically brand-new.

776
01:04:40,930 --> 01:04:45,060
别让这点骗了你
Don't let that fool you.

777
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:47,200
她是乐园里最老的接待员

778
01:04:49,570 --> 01:04:51,340

告诉我们  你对你的世界的看法

781
01:05:07,590 --> 01:05:10,960
有人选择看到这个世界上的丑恶

782
01:05:12,930 --> 01:05:14,690
那些无秩序的混乱

783
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:20,430
早上好  爸爸  睡得好吗

784
01:05:20,430 --> 01:05:22,800
很好

785
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:26,270
你要去接着画你那幅画吗
You heading out to do some more of that painting of yours?

786

某个目标
A purpose.

789
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:47,950
我知道万物皆有定数
I know things will work out the way they're meant to.
