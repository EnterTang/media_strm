00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:33,890
【负 重 前 行】

2
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,890
妈
Ma.

3
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,260
好棒
That's it.

4
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,800
妈妈
Mama.

5
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,760
凯伊？
Kay?

6
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,600
你们好啊
Hey!

7
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,800
- 安迪 - 你们好啊
- Andy - Hello!

8
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,220
（隔离救助包）

9
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,800
我们的粮食够吃三餐
So we have three meals.

10
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,220
最多能吃四餐
Four at a stretch.

11
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,390
知道了
Okay.

12
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:56,220
也就是说我们剩下四分之一的粮食
So that means we're down to quarter rations.

13
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,640
明白了
Okay.

14
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,140
有什么我不知情的计划你想让我知道吗？
Is there a plan I'm not aware of? Want to fill me in on it?

15
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,930
- 不 我喜欢你的计划 - 哪一个计划？
- No, I like your plan. - Which is?

16
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,970
吃笔的计划
That we eat the pens.

17
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,010
听着 这里有个小镇
Look, there's a town here.

18
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,510
距离这里不超过30或40公里
Can't be more than 30 or 40 km from where we are.

19
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,890
那是个农村 人不多
Right? It's rural. There's not a lot of people.

20
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,430
我们去弄台车 塞满补给 去看看那里有什么
I say we get a car, fill it with supplies, we just see what's out there.

21
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:23,010
- 我们已经看过外面的情况了 - 我们看到的是几周前的情况
- We've seen what's out there. - We've seen what's back there. Weeks ago.

22
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,800
- 那里岸边很安静... - 我们讨论过这事了
- It's quiet on the banks... - We talked about this.

23
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,100
- 要是我们能逃出去呢？- 要是逃不出去呢？
- What if we've outrun it? - What if we haven't?

24
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,510
我们必须要待在这里
Where we need to be, actually, is here.

25
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,640
这条河已经把我们带到这里
The river has got us this far.

26
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,550
若我们做了正确决定 就能抵达这里 所以我们必须做有把握的事
If we play it smart, it'll get us there, but we have to stick to what we know.

27
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:42,550
有把握的事？在我们发现这艘船前 你根本没上过船
What we know? You had barely set foot on a boat before we found this thing.

28
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,050
这船比我们的年龄加在一起还老
I mean, it's older than both of us put together.

29
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,390
要是引擎坏了呢？那会发生什么事？
What if the engine goes? What happens then?

30
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,970
我们还要考虑到萝西
We have to think about Rosie.

31
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:52,640
是吗？抱歉 我没想到 不然你以为我在搞什么？
Do we? I hadn't thought of that. What the fuck do you think I'm doing?

32
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,740
听着 上岸是我们最后的选择
Look, we can't set foot on the shore until it is our last and only option.

33
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,680
事情就是这样 我很抱歉
That's just the way it is, I'm sorry.

34
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:05,220
那会发生在我们女儿被饿死之前还是之后？
So is that going to be before or after our daughter starves to death?

35
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,470
嘘
Shh.

36
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,720
天啊
Jesus Christ.

37
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,550
我的天啊
My God.

38
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,680
天啊
Wow.

39
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,550
- 有鱼上钩吗？- 嗯 还没
- Any bites? - Um-mm. Not yet.

40
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,260
- 等一下 - 快点 用那个东西直接钩上来
- Oh, hang on a second. - Quick. Hook him with the thing.

41
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,100
- 什么东西？钩子吗？- 对 把它拉上来 快点
- What, with the hook? Whoa. - Yeah, bring him in, quick!

42
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,100
- 什么？- 这是什么？
- What? - What's that?

43
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,970
- 这是你从哪里弄来的？- 从那艘坏掉的游艇
- Where did you get this from? - From the wrecked yacht.

44
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,300
说谢谢就行了 看看这个
Say thank you. Look at this.

45
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,720
这至少够我们吃三个月了
There's enough there for three months, at least.

46
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,640
- 这是个好消息 小蓝 - 这是很棒的消息
- Hey, this is good news, Blue. - It's great news.

47
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,390
你不用担心 这不是什么难事
You're not worried. It was a one - man job.

48
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,140
进去 出来 简单又安全
In and out. Easy. Safe.

49
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,350
拜托 这是件好事 小蓝 好极了
Come on, this is a win, Blue. This is a win.

50
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,640
当好事降临
We must celebrate those

51
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,430
- 我们该庆祝一下 - 好吧
- when they come along, just a little bit. - No, okay.

52
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,430
- 你确定这是安全的？- 我确定
- You sure it was safe? - Safe.

53
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,760
你有找到刮胡刀吗？
Is there a razor in that stash of yours?

54
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,390
为何要刮掉？这样看起来比较沉稳
Why? I'll have you know, this is rugged.

55
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,220
- 我觉得有点邋遢 - 是沉稳
- I think it's a bit ragged. - Rugged.

56
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,300
是沉稳
Rugged.

57
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,390
她还好吗？那只小猴子怎么样了？
How is she? How is little monkey?

58
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,800
她已经起床一阵子了
She's been down a while.

59
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,390
或许你该去跟她打声招呼
Maybe you should go say hello.

60
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,720
我不确定她会喜欢我去吵她
I'm not sure she'd like that much.

61
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,260
去睡一下吧
Hey, go and have a lie down.

62
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,760
- 可以吗？- 当然 去吧
- Yeah? - Yeah. Go.

63
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,010
男子汉
Man.

64
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,970
- 你才是 - 配美女
- You are. - Woman.

65
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,140
好女孩 萝西 好乖
Good girl, Rosie. Yes.

66

67
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,680
太好了
Yes.

68
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,510
好了
Okay.

69
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,800

妈咪在哪里？
Where's Mommy then?

75
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,550
她上哪去了？
Where is she?

76
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:09,890
凯伊？
Kay?

77
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,720
凯伊 你在里面吗？
Kay? Are you in there?

78
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,680
凯伊 让我进去 宝贝
Kay! Come on, let me in, babe.

79
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,550
让我进去
Let me in.

80
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,930
该死 凯伊 怎么...
Shit, Kay, what...

81
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,640
你做了什么？
What have you done?

82
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,510
- 不 别... 别看 - 让我看看
- No, don't... - Let me see.

83
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,220
- 别看 - 继续压着
- No. - Well, keep pressure on it.

84
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,510
- 没事的 没事了 - 妈妈
- Mama. - It's all right. It's okay.

85
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,510
该死
Oh, shit.

86
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,390
（48小时）

87
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,140
来 让我看看
Come on, let me see.

88
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,970
可恶
Oh, fuck.

89
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,260
好了 凯伊 我来... 你做了什么？
Right, Kay, just... Oh, what have you done?

90
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,100
- 我很抱歉 亲爱的 - 没关系 没事的
- I'm sorry, sweetheart. - It's all right. It's okay.

91
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:09,350
好 继续压着 继续加压
All right, keep that pressure on it. Keep pressure on.

92
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,220
该死
Shit.

93
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,100
- 可以吗？没事吧？- 没事
- Okay. All right? You okay? - Yeah.

94
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,300
可以吗？看着我
All right? Look at me.

95
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,850
- 没事了 - 不会有事的

给你
Hey.

99
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:45,300
- 告诉我 你在想什么？- 我们不能再待在这里了
- So talk to me. What are you thinking? - Well, we can't stay here.

100
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:49,510
但现在才过一小时 症状至少要三小时...
But it's only been an hour. Symptoms take at least three hours to...

101
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,350
我知道会怎么样 我们可能没有那么多时间
Yeah, I know how it works. We might not have that time.

102
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,510
- 我们不能冒险 - 现在上岸又变成冒险了？
- We can't take the risk. - Oh, so today it's a risk.

103
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,350
因为我现在受了伤 没错 这样就是在冒险
Out there, with this? Yes, it's a risk.

104
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:02,100
在还不知道要面对什么情况前 我们不能让萝西陷入危险
Let's not put Rosie in danger till we know what we're dealing with.

105
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,010
有数十种生物居住在这河里
There are dozens of things that live and eat in this river.

106
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,760
- 我们不知道是什么东西咬了你 - 那东西有手指 安迪
- We have no idea what bit you. - It had fingers, Andy.

107
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,430
靠
Fuck!

108
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:17,850
听着 若你被感染了 你只剩48个小时可活
Look, if you are sick, then you've got 48 hours,

109
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,350
那我们可以再做打算
and we'll deal with that.

110
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:22,100
但若你是错的 你没被感染
But if you're wrong, right, and you're not infected,

111
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:26,180
照你的失血速度来看 你顶多只能活2-3个小时
then at the rate you're bleeding, you've got two hours, three, tops.

112
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,760
我不会冒这样的风险
That's a risk I'm not gonna take.

113
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:32,100
我们必须去医院 就像你说过的
We need to get to the hospital, where you said.

114
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,640
有人会替你治疗 我们也能确认你是否被感染
Someone will patch you up and we'll hedge our bets.

115
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,850
要是我真的被感染了呢？
What if we lose?

116
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,220
要是我真的被感染了呢？
What if we lose?

117
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,100
让我做决定吧
It's gonna be my call.

118
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,890
好吧
Yeah.

119
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,390
来吧
Come on.

120
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,550
别看
Don't look.

121
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,600
来吧 小宝贝
Come on, little darling.

122
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,930
好了
Okay.

123
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,680
乖宝贝 来吧
Oh, good girl. Come here.

124
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,680
你在里头待一下 来吧
Put you in here for a minute. There we go.

125
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,220
快点
Come on.

126
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,300
好样的
Oh, you beauty.

127
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,350
好了
Right.

128
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,680
搞定
Just like that.

- 给我吧 - 谢谢 亲爱的
- Come here. - Thanks, sweetheart.

- 来吧 你待在车里就行了 好吗？- 好
- Come here. I just need you in the car, all right? - Ok.

131
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:21,890
真不容易
Impossible.

132
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,100
让我来 你去休息吧
I'll get in. Have a fiddle around with it.

133
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,510
好了 我等一下马上就上车
Okay, I'll be two secs.

134
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,640
好了
Right.

135
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,220
好了 宝贝
There you are, poppet.

136
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,550
这是为你挑的新车
There, the new mobile's sorted for you.

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,100
乖宝贝
Good girl.

139
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,850
快走
Go!

140
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,100
你还好吗？
How're you feeling?

141
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,180
没什么变化
Like me.

142
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,140
很好
Good.

143
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:15,550
小猴子 亲爱的 怎么了？
Hey, monkey, what is it, darling?

144
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,350
她需要换尿布
She needs a change.

145
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,890
- 我来吧 - 我来弄就好
- I'll do it. - No, it's fine.

146
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,260
她比较不会闹脾气
She'll make less fuss.

147
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,470
- 是啊 - 来吧 臭屁屁
- 'Course she will. - Come on, stinky trunks.

148
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,760
我们来把你弄干净
Let's get you cleaned up.

149
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,550
来了
There we go.

150
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,760
乖
Hey!

151
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,140
哇
Eww!

152
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,720
萝西小乖乖
Hey, Rosie posie.

153
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:48,930
凯伊
Kay!

154
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,600
乖 萝西
Hey, Rosie.

155
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:03,050
凯伊 头靠在我身上
Kay, give me your head.

156
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:06,470
好了 嘘...
All right. Shh...

157
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,260
嘘
Shh.

158
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,600
- 凯伊 深呼吸 - 停车
- Kay? Just breathe. - Stop the car.

159
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,260
- 看着我 - 停车
- Look at me now. - Stop the car!

160
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,760
- 我们需要冷静下来... - 让我出去
- We need to keep calm... - Let me out now!

161
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:13,300
天啊 等等
Jesus! Wait!

162
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:17,010
妈啊
Christ!

163
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,760
凯伊
Kay.

164
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,680
凯伊
Kay.

165
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,220
听着 你能否...
Hey, listen. Will you just...

166
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,800
你他妈的别碰我
Fuckin' don't touch me!

167
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,760
安迪 你控制不了这个的
Andy, you can't control this.

168
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,800
你根本无法替我治好这鬼玩意
You don't fucking keep this from me!

169
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:38,640
我们还要拖多久？直到我攻击你？
How long were you going to play along for? What, until I turn on you?

170
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,220
- 还是她？- 不
- On her? - No.

171
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,930
- 你必须带她走 - 你是什么意思？
- You must take her. - What?

172
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:45,260
- 你在说什么？要我离开你？小蓝？- 你得带她走
- What are you talking about? Leaving you? - You must take her.

173
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,970
住口 别说了
Stop. Just stop.

174
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,350
够了
Come on.

175
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,300
我在这里 好吗？
I'm here, all right?

176
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,220
不会有事的
It'll be all right.

177
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,760
来吧 我拉你起来
Come on, let's get you up.

178
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,140
我们不去医院
We're not going to the hospital.

179
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,140
我们就快到了
We are so close.

180
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,100
那会让你和萝西离这条河更远
It puts you and Rosie further from the river.

181
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,010
我们现在什么也没有了
There's nothing there for us now.

182
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,680
我们有时间 看到这个了吗？
Yeah there is. Time is there. See this?

183
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,050
这是你剩下的时间 我们要把握每分每秒
That's yours. All of it, every second, and we're gonna make it count.

184
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:42,350
但若你一直流血 很快就会变成行尸的
But if you bleed out, you'll turn sooner.

185
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,050
要让我做决定 记得吗？
It's my call, remember?

186
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,760
所以我就无权说话？我没选择权？
So I get no say in that? I don't have a choice?

187
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:49,430
对 亲爱的 你没有权利
No, sweetheart, you don't.

188
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,050
凯伊
Kay.

189
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,850
我不能那么做
I can't do that.

190
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,260
小心 当心这只脚
Watch the leg.

191
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,050
该死
Shit!

192
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,510
凯伊？
Kay?

193
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,550
萝西？
Rosie?

194
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,350
嘿 还好吗？
Hey, how're we doing?

195
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,050
萝西？
Rosie? Rose.

196
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,680
凯伊
Kay.

197
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,010
乖
Hey.

198
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:29,260
（救她）

199
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,180
小蓝？
Blue?

200
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,430
萝西
Rosie!

201
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,470
该死
Fuck!

202
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,470
可恶
Oh, fuck!

203
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,470
他们要来了
They're coming.

204
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,010
我要你当个乖女儿 乖乖待在这里
I need you to be a very good girl. Stay here.

205
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,260
乖乖在这里等爸爸
Nice and calm for Daddy.

206
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:02,140
我马上就回来 好吗？萝西 我马上回来
And he'll be right back. Hey, Rosie? Be right back.

207
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:37,930
哦
Oh.

208
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,140
不 不
No. No.

209
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,390
没事了
Mmm? It's all right.

210
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,760
我知道你喜欢什么
I know what you like.

211
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,640
嗯
Umm.

212
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,180
萝西 是妈咪的味道
Hey, Rosie. It's Mommy.

213
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,600
我闻得到妈咪的味道
I can smell Mommy.

214
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,300
我也闻得到妈咪的味道
I can smell Mommy too.

215
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,260
等等
Hey.

216
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:02,010
你这家伙
Hey!

217
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,930
你知道自己刚做了什么吗？
Do you know what you just did?

218
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:10,600
你离我远点 不准过来
You stay away. Stay back.

219
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,140
离我爸远一点
Leave my dad alone!

220
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,760
那玩意显示剩下多少时间？
What's the count left on that business?

221
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,600
嗯...
Uh...

222
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:41,600
差不多还有46小时
It's 46 hours, give or take.

223
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:44,390
坐吧
Sit.

224
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:01,890
让我看看你的手臂
Give us your arm.

225
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,260
这恐怕起不了多大作用
Won't do much, I'm afraid.

226
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,300
但或许能帮把你的伤口藏起来
But it might help you hide it.

227
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,220
最好把伤口都包起来
Best to do that around these parts.

228
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:27,600
没事了 亲爱的
It's all right, darling.

229
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,890
这是谁？
Who's this then?

230
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,050
萝西
It's Rosie.

231
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,970
- 妈妈 - 小可爱
- Mama. - Little flower.

232
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,720
大家都叫我爱塔
Folks call me Etta.

233
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,890
我叫安迪
Andy.

234
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:49,180
这地方看起来比地图上小很多
This place looked bigger on the map.

235
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:52,220
- 我们总是让人失望 - 医院是不是...
- We never fail to disappoint. - The hospital, is it...

236
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:55,260
- 那称不上医院 只是隔壁的一栋楼 - 好的
That's a generous description. It's the next building over. - Um.

237
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:58,050
那里没剩什么了 他们几年前削减了我们的资金
There's not much left. They cut our funding years back.

238
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,260
- 你是个老师？- 曾经是
- Are you a teacher? - I was.

239
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,510
你的学生们都上哪去了？
Where are they now, your students?

240
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,600
都走了
Gone.

241
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,720
真遗憾
I'm sorry.

242
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,680
不是死了 是离开了去过传统的生活了
No, not dead. Gone. Living in the old ways.

243
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:15,720
没什么好遗憾的 他们过得比我们其他人都好
Nothing to be sorry about. They're doing better than the rest of us.

244
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:18,720
全国各地的暴民都聚集在一起了
Mobs from all over the country coming together.

245
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:21,850
那些还有在联系的人都感觉到了
They sensed it, those who stayed connected.

246
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:27,800
这里原本的居民都离开了 回他们自己的国家去
The whole community up and left back to their country.

247
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,390
若你想住在这里的话 这里还有多余的床
There's a spare bed if you want one.

248
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,890
你怎么想 萝西？我们喜欢她吗？
What do you think, Rosie? Do we like her?

249
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,050
我们喜欢她吗？
Do we like her?

250
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:52,390
我想我们可能喜欢她
I think we might like her.

251
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:22,970
好了
Okay.

252
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:50,300
图米
Thoomi!

253
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,550
图米
Thoomi!

254
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,970
图米
Thoomi!

255
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:07,350
快回家
Come home!

256
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:14,180
嘘
Shh.

257
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,010
嘘
Shh.

258
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:28,180
- 我们现在要拿这些做什么？- 要做矛吗？
- what are we gonna do with this? - Make spears?

259
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:34,100
有点像妈妈做的意大利面 对吧？
Bit like Mom's spaghetti, eh?

260
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,180
爸
Dad!

261
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:39,390
以前我们会从动物身上取得这个
Back in the old days, we used to take this from an animal.

262
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,220
智者先生
Mr. Clever Man!

263
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,300
他们在毒害这片土地 你们知道吗？
They're poisoning this land, you know?

264
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,600
这个国家在改变
This country, changing.

265
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,430
这国家病了
It's sick.

266
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,970
我们都会生病
We all get sick.

267
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,300
你也会生病
You get sick too.

268
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:50,640
（32小时28分钟）

269
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,010
好乖
Yeah.

270
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:00,220
你好啊 爱塔
Hey, Etta.

271
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:04,470
你不能那么做 不能放弃希望
You can't do that. You can't lose hope.

272
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:13,220
这位是威利贝尔
This is Willie Bell.

273
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:18,100
他是个好人 也是我朋友 他女儿图米是我的学生之一
He's a good man. A friend. His daughter Thoomi was one of mine.

274
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:20,760
她聪明伶俐
Smart as a whip.

275
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:24,180
- 跟她爸一个样 - 我见过他们
- Her daddy's shadow. - Yeah, I've seen them.

276
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,180
你回去告诉威利是爱塔要你去的
Well, you just head right back and tell Willie that Etta sent you.

277
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,890
若你想给这个宝宝第二次机会
If you want to give this baby a second chance,

278
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:32,390
你就该去找他
that's where you go.

279
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,680
好吗？
Yeah?

280
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:35,600
谢谢你
Thanks.

281
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,890
- 你看到那些火了吗？- 看到了
- Have you seen the fires? - Yeah.

282
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:42,970
那些狩猎团在清理岛上受感染的人 你必须离远一点
Hunting parties are cleansing the land of the sick ones. You just stay away.

283
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,260
萝西
Hey, Rosie.

284
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:49,260
再见 亲爱的
Bye bye, darling. Bye bye.

285
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:52,180
再见
Bye bye.

286
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:54,930
你自己小心点
Now you take care.

287
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,680
（闪边去 注意 天然气井）

288
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,300
（军事基地）

289
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,930
有人吗？这里是哪里？
Hello, what's here?

290
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,180
给你一些水喝 亲爱的
Let's give you some water, darling.

291
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,050
那是我的
That's mine.

292
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:04,640
靠
Fuck.

293
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:07,640
军事基地已经沦陷
Army base is overrun.

294
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:10,220
还会有更多
There'll be more.

295
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,680
他们在数公里外就能听见那枪声
They would have heard that shot for miles.

296
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,010
最好让那宝宝安静一点
Better keep that baby quiet too.

297
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:21,470
听着 你把我弄出去 我也会带你离开这里
Listen, how about you get me out of here and then I'll get you out of here?

298
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:22,600
去哪里？
To where?

299
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,890
一个能让你稍微躲一下的地方
A place you could hole up for a bit.

300
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:30,100
那小家伙还是要有女人照顾比较好
The little one, be real nice for the wife to have that around.

301
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,550
你最好想快一点 把我拉出来
You better think fast. Tow it off me.

302
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,640
该死
Shit.

303
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,350
- 快点 - 你有钥匙吗？
- Come on. - Got the keys?

304
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,050
你别搞我
Don't you fuck me.

305
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,100
好家伙 拿着这个
Good man. Take this.

306
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:02,260
来吧 我们走
Come on. Let's go.

307
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,010
这家伙在公路上挥手要搭我的便车
Flagged me down on the highway, this bloke.

308
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,300
他被一些挖土人困住了
Put himself in a spot with some diggers.

309
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,800
你好
Hello.

310
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,220
你好
Hello.

311
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,640
乖女孩 闭上你的眼睛
Attagirl. Close your eyes.

312
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,930
挺不错的 不 这很美丽
It's nice. No, it's beautiful.

313
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:41,930
萝伦会带你去安顿一下
Rainey'll get you settled.

314
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:53,850
我能放她下来吗？
Do you mind if I put her down?

315
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,760
他不曾带人回来的
He doesn't bring people back.

316
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:22,510
我们很高兴成为他的例外 对吧？
Well, we're very glad he made an exception, aren't we?

317
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,720
谢谢
Thanks.

318
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:34,180
- 那就是我们在这里的原因 - 因为天然气？
- That's why we're here. - What, the gas?

319
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:38,010
维克已经规划好回归正轨后的生活
Vic has plans for when things get back to normal.

320
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,260
根本不会有这种事 对吧？
It's not going to happen. Is it?

321
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,100
我觉得应该没那么快
I don't think normal is on the horizon.

322
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:48,550
（危险 高压天然气管）

323
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,300
你们在天然气公司工作吗？
You worked on the lines?

324
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,100
我在食堂工作
In the canteen.

325
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:55,390
我负责做菜
I cooked.

326
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:58,470
这是最重要的工作
Right, well, that's the most important job of all.

327
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:00,470
男人一定都很爱你
Men must have loved you.

328
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:02,550
曾经有个人很爱我
One did.

329
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:13,470
你是我看见的第一个活人
You're the first people I've seen.

330
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:17,850
第一个还是人的人类
The first people who are still people.

331
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,300
是啊
Yeah.

332
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:29,050
好了 老兄 我们走吧
All right, mate, let's go.

333
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:31,550
他们才刚到 维克
They've only just arrived, Vic.

334
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,600
若他习惯了 就会离不开了
Well, if he's in, he's all the way in.

335
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:39,050
萝伦会照顾她 带她上去 抱抱她
Rainey'll look after her. Take her up there, cuddle her.

336
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:40,680
她根本不会知道你离开了
Won't even notice you're gone.

337
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:44,850
我会保护她的安全
I'll keep her safe.

338
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:49,510
很好
Great.

339
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:53,300
拜托照顾好她
Please look after her.

340
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:54,930
好吗？
Okay.

341
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:58,720
来吧 萝西 这是...
Come on, Rosie. This is...

342
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:01,260
- 没问题吧？- 妈妈
- You okay? - Mama!

343
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:02,510
好
Yes.

344
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,600
乖
Hey.

345
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,890
这能让她冷静下来
This calms her down.

346
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,640
好的
Okay.

347
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,260
- 好了... - 回头见
- All right... - See you soon.

348
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:12,350
是啊
Yeah.

349
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:14,430
回头见
Yeah.

350
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:25,010
（反对提炼天然气？滚出去吧 ）

351
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:33,350
维克
Vic.

352
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:36,470
这是什么？
What's this?

353
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:40,600
用过这玩意吗？
Ever used one of these?

354
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:42,350
没有
No.

355
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,550
往前站 站45度角
Move forward. Stand forty - five.

356
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:52,350
和目标物呈45度
Forty - five degrees to the target.

357
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:54,470
然后顶在肩窝...
Now move the stock into your shoulder...

358
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:56,010
我们要射杀他们？
We're going to shoot them?

359
00:47:56,890 --> 00:47:57,930
没错
Yeah.

360
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,260
反正你也不会想亲他们 对吧？现在把脸颊贴在垫腮板上
You're not gonna kiss 'em, are ya? Now cheek to the cheek plate.

361
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:04,640
如果目标变得模糊 代表你做对了
If the target's blurry, you're doing it right.

362
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,510
- 是吗？- 懂了吗？
- Yeah? - You got it?

363
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:10,300
- 我不太确定 可能吧 - 先压着扳机 但别扣下
- Uh, I'm not sure. I think so. - Squeeze the trigger but don't pull it.

364
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:11,680
- 真的吗？- 没错
- Really? - Yeah.

365
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,390
若你扣了板机 准心就会跑掉 试试看吧
If you pull it, then you throw your sights out. So back up.

366
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:17,140
现在压着扳机
Now squeeze.

367
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:20,680
会越来越紧 继续压...
Feel the resistance. Squeeze...

368
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:23,760
好了
All right.

369
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:29,760
现在继续射击直到对方倒下 除非全都打倒了... 否则别停下来
Now keep shooting till you drop him... and don't stop till we got 'em all.

370
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:38,300
快点 我可帮不了你 老兄
Come on, I can't carry you, mate.

371
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:17,850
我以为我们是为了天然气而来
I thought we were here for gas.

372
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:20,970
- 这叫额外的收入 - 那她怎么办？
- Call it a side earner. - What's that got to do with her?

373
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,510
没有鱼饵 鱼就上不了钩
Can't catch a fish without bait.

374
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:27,390
当国家回到正轨 大家就会开始有物欲
When this country gets back on track, people are gonna want things.

375
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:31,140
能控制市场 能源 天然气
Whoever controls the market, power, gas...

376
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,930
拥有闪亮亮的东西的... 人就能享受安乐的生活
all the shiny shit... will be sitting pretty.

377
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,890
打铁要趁热嘛
I'm just making hay while the sun shines.

378
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:40,640
你想太多了 维克
The sun's not shining, Vic.

379
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,260
什么对你来说才重要？
What's it worth to ya?

380
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,640
一个让你和孩子安全的地方？
A safe place for you and your kid?

381
00:49:57,470 --> 00:50:00,390
你只需要担心自己的女儿就好
Only girl you need to be worried about is your own.

382
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:02,510
把这个装满
Fill it up.

383
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:23,470
没事的
Hey, it's okay.

384
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:26,680
别怕 只是天然气快没了
No, just low on gas, that's all.

385
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,140
天然气快没了而已
Just low on gas.

386
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:29,800
嘘
Shh.

387
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:32,220
萝西
Hey, Rosie.

388
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:06,180
我告诉过你
I told you mob.

389
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:09,260
那些天然气井是我的 里面的东西也是我的
The wells are mine along with what's in 'em.

390
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,010
若敢跟我斗
Fuck with me...

391
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:26,510
我就绝不会放过你
and I'll fuck with you.

392
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:35,350
你在里面看起来挺孤单的
You look lonely in there.

393
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:39,010
放点音乐给你召几个朋友过来吧
See if we can drum you up some company.

394
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,680
∮ Full of pain and misery ∮

395
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,760
∮ A crazy thing ∮

396

∮ With your love tonight ∮

400
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:59,050
∮ Trust me It will be all right ∮

401
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:01,890
∮ I'm in Heaven when he's in my hand... ∮

402
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:18,550
她在睡觉
She's sleeping.

403
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:42,010
你今天做得不错
You did well today.

404
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:45,760
或许我们可以考虑让你住下来
Maybe we can talk about you staying on permanent.

405
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:50,220
我帮她洗过澡了
I cleaned her up.

406
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,470
∮ 一闪一闪亮晶晶 ∮
∮ Twinkle, twinkle, little star ∮

407
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:26,140

∮ 满天都是小星星 ∮
∮ How I wonder what you are ∮

409
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:40,220
好了 你乖乖睡吧
Come on. You're all right. Come on.

410
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:47,010
天啊
Oh.

411
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:09,470
嘿 萝西
Hey, Rosie.

412
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,640
我爱你
I love you.

413
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:24,100
快动手啊 孬种
Come on, you fucker.

414
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:26,970
快动手 孬种
Come on, you fucker.

415
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:30,470
拜托你别那么做
Please don't.

416
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:35,550
萝伦
Lorraine.

417
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:37,300
你不该来这里的
You shouldn't be here.

418
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:40,550
我知道你想做什么 我也知道原因
I know what you're doing, and I know why.

419
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:43,260
拜托你 帮我照顾她
Please, just look after her for me.

420
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:44,390
我会的
I will.

421
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:46,010
但我在这里无法保护她
But not here.

422
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:48,930
- 萝伦 这里最安全了 - 在他身边就不安全
- Lorraine, this is as safe as it gets. - Not from him.

423
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:53,010
- 你剩几小时？- 大概20小时
- What's your count? - It's around 20.

424
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:56,600
- 带我们去别的地方 - 他虽然不完美 但这里很安全
- Take us somewhere else. - He is not perfect, but here it's secure.

425
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,640
- 你先生... - 他不是我先生
- Your husband... - He's not my husband.

426
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:02,970
那家伙眼睁睁看着我先生和其他人死在天然气厂
That man left my husband to die at the gas plant with everyone else.

427
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:04,850
他为了让自己活命 把他们锁在里面
Locked them in to save his own skin.

428
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:09,010
我绝对会比他更能保护这小女孩
I could protect this little girl more than he ever will.

429
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,760
但在这里没办法
But not here.

430
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:26,850
河边有一户人家 但我不确定他们是否活着
There is a family by the river. I don't know if they're still alive.

431
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:30,470
- 我不确定我们能否及时赶到 - 这里看起来挺舒适的
- I don't know if we can make it in time. - This looks cozy.

432
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:37,930
要是我不知道的话 我还以为你想拐走我的女人 安迪
If I didn't know better, I'd think you were trying to steal my girl, Andy.

433
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:39,260
你别想太多了
You do know better.

434
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:00,720
萝西
Rosie!

435
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:38,220
维克
Vic!

436
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:46,890
快让我出去 混蛋 我不会伤害你的
Come on, let me out, you fuck! I'm not going to hurt you.

437
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:48,680
我不会伤害你的 好吗？
I'm not going to hurt you, okay?

438
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:54,100
好 你来一下 我得研究这个锁
Okay, come with me. I need to have a look at this.

439
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:57,700
天啊 听着 我不会伤害你 我保证
God, look, I'm not going to hurt you, I promise you.

440
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:01,100
当我我看见你... 我昨天看见你的时候
When I saw you... when I saw you yesterday...

441
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:03,800
我很抱歉 你可以对我生气 我不介意
I'm sorry about that. You can be mad at me.

442
00:58:03,890 --> 00:58:06,300
但若你想出去 只能靠我了 我们一起合作吧
If you want out, I'm your ticket. Let's play ball.

443
00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:09,430
你想去找你的朋友？
Do you want to see your friend?

444
00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:12,010
他不是我的朋友 我只是要把女儿抱回来
He's not my friend. I just want my daughter back.

445
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:16,260
- 我也想要某个东西 - 你要什么？
- I want something too. - What do you want?

446
00:58:16,970 --> 00:58:19,430
他那把能打开智者先生笼子的钥匙
His keys to the Clever Man's cage.

447
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:21,350
不管你要什么都可以
Whatever that is, you can have 'em.

448
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:35,140
- 他们要来了 - 什么？
- They're coming. - Huh?

449
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,260
那些鬼 他们闻到味道了
The ghosts. They smell it.

450
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:25,850
再加把劲
Come on.

451
00:59:41,350 --> 00:59:42,680
该死
Shit.

452
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:45,760
等这栅栏被拉起 你就马上出来
When this lifts up, you gotta slide out straight away.

453
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:48,550
很好 就是这样
Come on. That's it.

454
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:55,640
快 就是现在 我们走
Come on! That's it! Let's go!

455
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:27,050
快走
Go!

456
01:01:31,470 --> 01:01:34,140
来 萝伦 我来抱她吧
Here, Lorraine, give her to me.

457
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:36,970
该死的小偷
Fucking thief!

458
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:39,050
给我回来
Get back here!

459
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:40,680
- 安迪 - 不
- Andy! - No!

460
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:45,050
维克 不要
Vic, no!

461
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:13,430
萝伦
Rainey!

462
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:16,550
萝伦
Rainey!

463
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:39,970
他不见了 来吧 我们走吧
He's gone. Come on, let's go.

464
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,010
等等
Wait.

465
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:14,680
我闻到你的臭味了 你这小人
I can smell your rot, you weasly cunt!

466
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:18,100
- 你带走不属于你的东西 - 该死
- What you took didn't belong to you! - Shit.

467
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:32,550
把那他妈的黑婊子还给我
You give me back the fucking black bitch!

468
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:34,510
她是我的
She's mine!

469
01:03:35,390 --> 01:03:39,760
若你把她还给我 或许我能放你女儿一马
If you give her to me, then maybe there'll be a happy ending for your kid!

470
01:03:40,890 --> 01:03:43,140
但如果你让我找到你们
But if I have to fucking come looking,

471
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:46,760
你就死定了 而且她们会更惨
then it'll be bad for you and worse for them.

472
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:50,220
嘘
Shh.

473
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:57,800
或许我在这等个两天就行了吧？
Maybe I'll just wait a couple of days, huh?

474
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,600
直到你已经不是你自己
Until you're not you anymore.

475
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:04,930
我就可以眼睁睁...
And I'll just watch...

476
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,760
看着你把她们吃了
while you eat their fucking faces off.

477
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:11,800
好孩子
Good girl.

478
01:06:00,970 --> 01:06:04,260
图米 我得回到河边 你能带我去吗？
Thoomi, I need to get back to the river. Can you show me the way?

479
01:06:04,350 --> 01:06:05,930
我必须要找到智者先生
I've gotta find the Clever Man.

480
01:06:06,010 --> 01:06:09,890
听着 我没时间... 智者先生到底是什么？
Oh, look, I don't have time for... What is a Clever Man, anyway?

481
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:12,050
是一个聪明的人还是什么？
Is he just a smart guy, or what?

482
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:14,550
他是一个魔法师
He's a magic man.

483
01:06:16,350 --> 01:06:19,100
若你生病了 他能给你良药
If you're sick, he can give you good medicine.

484
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:23,470
若有人偷走了你的灵魂 他可以帮你要回来
And if someone steals your spirit away, he can put it back again.

485
01:06:24,050 --> 01:06:28,390
嘿 你觉得你爸变成那样是因为他失去了灵魂？
Hey, you think your dad is acting the way he is because he lost his soul?

486
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:32,850
图米 有很多人都像你爸那样走路
There are lots of people walking around like your dad.

487
01:06:32,930 --> 01:06:35,430
- 我爸跟其他人不一样 - 不 我并不认同
- My dad's different. - I don't think that's true.

488
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:38,430
我跟你爸都无药可救了
There's no fixing what your father and I have.

489
01:06:38,510 --> 01:06:40,390
有很多聪明的人都试过了
Lots of other smart guys have tried.

490
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:47,260
你要去哪里？
Where are you going?

491
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:49,050
我要去看个东西
I've gotta check something.

492
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:50,930
看什么？
Check what?

493
01:06:51,010 --> 01:06:52,640
图米 你要看什么？
Thoomi, check what?

494
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:54,510
我的老天
For fuck's sake.

495
01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:08,010
（威利）

496
01:08:29,890 --> 01:08:32,050
天啊 图米
Jesus, Thoomi.

497
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:33,140
快住手
Hey, stop!

498
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:34,430
走开
Go away!

499
01:08:35,050 --> 01:08:37,720
这是缅怀仪式 你只是个愚蠢的“嘎把”
This is sorry business. You're just a stupid gubba.

500
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:39,140
你什么都不懂
You don't know anything.

501
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:48,600
那是我爸
That's my dad.

502
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:54,350
我们会把死者埋在树中 鬼魂就无法唤醒他们
We get buried in the trees so the ghosts can't wake us.

503
01:08:56,550 --> 01:08:58,430
他的灵魂仍不在他身上
His spirit's still loose.

504
01:08:58,510 --> 01:08:59,550
这都是我的错
It's my fault.

505
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:01,430
我浪费太多时间了
I took too long.

506
01:09:03,550 --> 01:09:04,640
不 不是你的错
No you didn't.

507
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:07,470
你没有浪费太多时间 这不是你的错
No you didn't. This isn't your fault.

508
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:10,430
我把他绑在这里 好让我能把智者先生带来
I tied him here till I could bring the Clever Man back.

509
01:09:10,510 --> 01:09:12,300
族人不该找到他的
They weren't supposed to find him.

510
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:14,970
他们认为自己在做正确的事
They thought they were doing the right thing.

511
01:09:16,390 --> 01:09:17,470
他们做得也没错
They did.

512
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:20,970
他已不再是你爸了
That wasn't your dad anymore.

513
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:24,180
很遗憾 但他已经变了
I'm sorry, but it wasn't.

514
01:09:25,510 --> 01:09:28,970
我应该把智者先生带来 而不是带你来
I should have been here, with him, not you.

515
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:37,390
图米 我得走了 对不起
Thoomi, I have to go. I'm sorry.

516
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:44,140
我觉得萝西希望你跟我们一起走
I think Rosie would like it if you came with us.

517
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:45,970
你跟我们一起走的话 我会比较开心
I'd be happier if you did.

518
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:50,260
我根本不在乎你和你的女儿
I don't care about you or your baby.

519
01:09:54,050 --> 01:09:55,510
我觉得你不是真心说这话的
I don't think you mean that.

520
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:10,760
她不会有事的
She'll be okay.

521
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:13,760
她不会有事的 该死
She'll be okay. Shit.

522
01:10:14,550 --> 01:10:15,720
该死
Shit.

523
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:24,720
（9小时2分钟）

524
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:25,680
萝西？
Rosie?

525
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:30,890
河往这边走
River's this way.

526
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:01,220
你弄那些树叶干什么？
What's with the leaves?

527
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,350
这样可以隐藏我的脚印
They hide my footprints.

528
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:07,850
你怕谁看到？那些鬼吗？
From who? The ghosts?

529
01:13:07,930 --> 01:13:09,470
不 我妈
No, my mom.

530
01:13:18,930 --> 01:13:20,100
有人吗？
Hello?

531
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:25,260
饿吗？
Hungry?

532
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:45,680
太好了
Yes.

533
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:48,350
找到了
Bingo.

534
01:13:50,390 --> 01:13:52,640
可能会有点刺痛
This might sting a little bit.

535
01:13:53,260 --> 01:13:54,220
伤口在哪边？
Where is it?

536
01:13:54,850 --> 01:13:56,050
这里吗？准备好了吗？
There? Ready?

537
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:03,220
你为什么要那么做？
Why'd you do that?

538
01:14:04,180 --> 01:14:05,390
那是传统的生活
It's from the old ways.

539
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:07,970
但已经不再是我们的传统了
But not our ways anymore.

540
01:14:08,050 --> 01:14:09,550
为什么？
Then why?

541
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:12,260
因为很痛
'Cause it hurts.

542
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:15,930
当这里的伤口愈合 或许心里的伤口也会愈合
When this hurt heals, maybe this hurt heals too.

543
01:14:19,890 --> 01:14:21,390
住这里的人去哪里了？
Where did all the people go?

544
01:14:23,350 --> 01:14:24,550
应该没走远
Not far.

545
01:14:25,010 --> 01:14:26,350
食物还很新鲜
The food's still fresh.

546
01:14:27,050 --> 01:14:28,550
你为什么要找他们？
Why do you want 'em?

547
01:14:28,930 --> 01:14:30,850
因为我想请他们帮忙
'Cause I want to ask them a favor.

548
01:14:30,930 --> 01:14:33,260
你女儿吗？他们会让她留下吗？
About bub? Are they gonna keep her?

549
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:36,100
我们应该要想想你该怎么办
We should think about what we're gonna do with you.

550
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:37,720
或许他们不会回来了
Maybe they won't come back.

551
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:40,010
我觉得他们应该会
I think they will.

552
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:41,300
要是他们没回来呢？
What if they don't?

553
01:14:44,390 --> 01:14:45,680
那你就是我最后的希望了
Then you're all I've got.

554
01:15:37,470 --> 01:15:38,510
你好
Hello?

555
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:47,850
露营车可以给你
The caravan's yours.

556
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:50,930
只要你能发动 车子也给你
Car too, if you can start it.

557
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,140
我需要的不是车子
It's not the car I need.

558
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:12,640
听着
Look.

559
01:16:14,180 --> 01:16:16,140
我有六发子弹 好吗？
I've got six, okay?

560
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:19,720
若你变成行尸 最后两颗留给你
