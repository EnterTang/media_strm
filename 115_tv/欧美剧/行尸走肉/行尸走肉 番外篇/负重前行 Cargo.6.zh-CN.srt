00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:33,795
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs20}【负 重 前 行】

00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,795
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}妈
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Ma.

3
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:58,170
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}好棒
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}That's it.

4
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,712
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}妈妈
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Mama.

5
00:02:26,587 --> 00:02:27,670
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}凯伊？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Kay?

6
00:02:35,462 --> 00:02:36,504
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}你们好啊
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Hey!

7
00:02:37,712 --> 00:02:38,712
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 安迪 - 你们好啊
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- Andy - Hello!

8
00:03:42,545 --> 00:03:45,129
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}（隔离救助包）

9
00:03:47,004 --> 00:03:48,712
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我们的粮食够吃三餐
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}So we have three meals.

10
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:50,129
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}最多能吃四餐
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Four at a stretch.

11
00:03:50,212 --> 00:03:51,295
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}知道了
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Okay.

12
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,129
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}也就是说我们剩下四分之一的粮食
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}So that means we're down to quarter rations.

13
00:03:57,545 --> 00:03:58,545
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}明白了
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Okay.

14
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:02,045
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}有什么我不知情的计划你想让我知道吗？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Is there a plan I'm not aware of? Want to fill me in on it?

15
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,837
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 不 我喜欢你的计划 - 哪一个计划？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- No, I like your plan. - Which is?

16
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,879
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}吃笔的计划
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}That we eat the pens.

17
00:04:08,004 --> 00:04:09,920
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}听着 这里有个小镇
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Look, there's a town here.

18
00:04:10,004 --> 00:04:12,420
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}距离这里不超过30或40公里
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Can't be more than 30 or 40 km from where we are.

19
00:04:12,504 --> 00:04:14,795
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}那是个农村 人不多
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Right? It's rural. There's not a lot of people.

20
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,337
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我们去弄台车 塞满补给 去看看那里有什么
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}I say we get a car, fill it with supplies, we just see what's out there.

21
00:04:19,004 --> 00:04:22,920
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 我们已经看过外面的情况了 - 我们看到的是几周前的情况
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- We've seen what's out there. - We've seen what's back there. Weeks ago.

22
00:04:23,337 --> 00:04:25,712
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 那里岸边很安静... - 我们讨论过这事了
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- It's quiet on the banks... - We talked about this.

23
00:04:25,795 --> 00:04:28,004
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 要是我们能逃出去呢？- 要是逃不出去呢？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- What if we've outrun it? - What if we haven't?

24
00:04:28,504 --> 00:04:31,420
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我们必须要待在这里
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Where we need to be, actually, is here.

25
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:33,545
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}这条河已经把我们带到这里
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}The river has got us this far.

26
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:37,462
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}若我们做了正确决定 就能抵达这里 所以我们必须做有把握的事
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}If we play it smart, it'll get us there, but we have to stick to what we know.

27
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:42,462
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}有把握的事？在我们发现这艘船前 你根本没上过船
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}What we know? You had barely set foot on a boat before we found this thing.

28
00:04:42,545 --> 00:04:44,962
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}这船比我们的年龄加在一起还老
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}I mean, it's older than both of us put together.

29
00:04:45,045 --> 00:04:47,295
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}要是引擎坏了呢？那会发生什么事？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}What if the engine goes? What happens then?

30
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:48,879
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我们还要考虑到萝西
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}We have to think about Rosie.

31
00:04:48,962 --> 00:04:52,545
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}是吗？抱歉 我没想到 不然你以为我在搞什么？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Do we? I hadn't thought of that. What the fuck do you think I'm doing?

32
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:58,645
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}听着 上岸是我们最后的选择
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Look, we can't set foot on the shore until it is our last and only option.

33
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,587
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}事情就是这样 我很抱歉
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}That's just the way it is, I'm sorry.

34
00:05:01,462 --> 00:05:05,129
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}那会发生在我们女儿被饿死之前还是之后？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}So is that going to be before or after our daughter starves to death?

35
00:05:12,129 --> 00:05:13,379
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}嘘
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Shh.

36
00:07:12,337 --> 00:07:13,629
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}天啊
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Jesus Christ.

37
00:07:23,462 --> 00:07:24,462
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我的天啊
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}My God.

38
00:07:35,545 --> 00:07:36,587
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}天啊
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Wow.

39
00:08:43,712 --> 00:08:46,462
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 有鱼上钩吗？- 嗯 还没
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- Any bites? - Um-mm. Not yet.

40
00:08:48,045 --> 00:08:51,170
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 等一下 - 快点 用那个东西直接钩上来
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- Oh, hang on a second. - Quick. Hook him with the thing.

41
00:08:51,254 --> 00:08:54,004
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 什么东西？钩子吗？- 对 把它拉上来 快点
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- What, with the hook? Whoa. - Yeah, bring him in, quick!

42

{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 什么？- 这是什么？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- What? - What's that?

43
00:08:58,087 --> 00:09:00,879
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 这是你从哪里弄来的？- 从那艘坏掉的游艇
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- Where did you get this from? - From the wrecked yacht.

44
00:09:00,962 --> 00:09:03,212
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}说谢谢就行了 看看这个
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Say thank you. Look at this.

45
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,629
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}这至少够我们吃三个月了
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}There's enough there for three months, at least.

46
00:09:08,212 --> 00:09:10,545
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 这是个好消息 小蓝 - 这是很棒的消息
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- Hey, this is good news, Blue. - It's great news.

47
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,295
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}你不用担心 这不是什么难事
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}You're not worried. It was a one - man job.

{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}In and out. Easy. Safe.

{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}拜托 这是件好事 小蓝 好极了
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Come on, this is a win, Blue. This is a win.

50
00:09:18,337 --> 00:09:19,545
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}当好事降临
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}We must celebrate those

51
00:09:19,629 --> 00:09:22,337
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 我们该庆祝一下 - 好吧
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- when they come along, just a little bit. - No, okay.

{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}你有找到刮胡刀吗？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Is there a razor in that stash of yours?

54
00:09:37,754 --> 00:09:40,295
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}为何要刮掉？这样看起来比较沉稳
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Why? I'll have you know, this is rugged.

55
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,129
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 我觉得有点邋遢 - 是沉稳
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- I think it's a bit ragged. - Rugged.

{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Rugged.

57

{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}她还好吗？那只小猴子怎么样了？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}How is she? How is little monkey?

58
00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:51,712
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}她已经起床一阵子了
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}She's been down a while.

59
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:54,295
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}或许你该去跟她打声招呼
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Maybe you should go say hello.

60
00:09:56,004 --> 00:09:57,629
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我不确定她会喜欢我去吵她
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}I'm not sure she'd like that much.

61
00:09:59,795 --> 00:10:01,170

{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Hey, go and have a lie down.

00:14:41,962 --> 00:14:45,212
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 告诉我 你在想什么？- 我们不能再待在这里了
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- So talk to me. What are you thinking? - Well, we can't stay here.

100
00:14:45,962 --> 00:14:49,420
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}但现在才过一小时 症状至少要三小时...
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}But it's only been an hour. Symptoms take at least three hours to...

101
00:14:49,504 --> 00:14:52,254
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我知道会怎么样 我们可能没有那么多时间
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Yeah, I know how it works. We might not have that time.

102
00:14:52,754 --> 00:14:55,420
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 我们不能冒险 - 现在上岸又变成冒险了？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- We can't take the risk. - Oh, so today it's a risk.

103
00:14:55,504 --> 00:14:58,254
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}因为我现在受了伤 没错 这样就是在冒险
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Out there, with this? Yes, it's a risk.

104
00:14:58,837 --> 00:15:02,004
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}在还不知道要面对什么情况前 我们不能让萝西陷入危险
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Let's not put Rosie in danger till we know what we're dealing with.

105
00:15:02,087 --> 00:15:04,920
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}有数十种生物居住在这河里
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}There are dozens of things that live and eat in this river.

106
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,670
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 我们不知道是什么东西咬了你 - 那东西有手指 安迪
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- We have no idea what bit you. - It had fingers, Andy.

107
00:15:08,087 --> 00:15:09,337
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}靠
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Fuck!

108
00:15:13,462 --> 00:15:17,754
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}听着 若你被感染了 你只剩48个小时可活
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Look, if you are sick, then you've got 48 hours,

109
00:15:17,837 --> 00:15:19,254
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}那我们可以再做打算
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}and we'll deal with that.

110
00:15:19,337 --> 00:15:22,004
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}但若你是错的 你没被感染
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}But if you're wrong, right, and you're not infected,

111
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:26,087
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}照你的失血速度来看 你顶多只能活2-3个小时
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}then at the rate you're bleeding, you've got two hours, three, tops.

112
00:15:27,962 --> 00:15:29,670
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我不会冒这样的风险
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}That's a risk I'm not gonna take.

113
00:15:29,754 --> 00:15:32,004
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我们必须去医院 就像你说过的
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}We need to get to the hospital, where you said.

114
00:15:32,087 --> 00:15:34,545
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}有人会替你治疗 我们也能确认你是否被感染
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Someone will patch you up and we'll hedge our bets.

115
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:35,754
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}要是我真的被感染了呢？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}What if we lose?

116
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:38,129
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}要是我真的被感染了呢？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}What if we lose?

117
00:15:43,462 --> 00:15:45,004
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}让我做决定吧
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}It's gonna be my call.

118
00:15:48,712 --> 00:15:49,795
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}好吧
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Yeah.

119

{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}来吧
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Come on.

120
00:16:21,295 --> 00:16:22,462
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}别看
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Don't look.

121
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,504
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}来吧 小宝贝
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Come on, little darling.

{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Come on.

126
00:18:03,212 --> 00:18:05,212

{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Oh, you beauty.

{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}搞定
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Just like that.

129
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,379
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 给我吧 - 谢谢 亲爱的
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- Come here. - Thanks, sweetheart.

130
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:18,004
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 来吧 你待在车里就行了 好吗？- 好
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- Come here. I just need you in the car, all right? - Ok.

131
00:18:20,795 --> 00:18:21,795
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}真不容易
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Impossible.

132
00:18:21,879 --> 00:18:24,004
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}让我来 你去休息吧
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}I'll get in. Have a fiddle around with it.

{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}好了 我等一下马上就上车
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Okay, I'll be two secs.

{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}好了
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Right.

{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}好了 宝贝
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}There you are, poppet.

{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}这是为你挑的新车
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}There, the new mobile's sorted for you.

137
00:18:36,295 --> 00:18:38,004
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}妈妈在这里
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Mama's here.

138
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,004
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}乖宝贝
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Good girl.

{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}你还好吗？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}How're you feeling?

141
00:20:07,004 --> 00:20:08,087
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}没什么变化
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Like me.

142
00:20:09,587 --> 00:20:11,045
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}很好
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Good.

143
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:15,462
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}小猴子 亲爱的 怎么了？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Hey, monkey, what is it, darling?

144
00:20:16,129 --> 00:20:17,254
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}她需要换尿布
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}She needs a change.

145
00:20:17,337 --> 00:20:18,795
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 我来吧 - 我来弄就好
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- I'll do it. - No, it's fine.

146
00:20:18,879 --> 00:20:20,170
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}她比较不会闹脾气
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}She'll make less fuss.

147
00:20:20,962 --> 00:20:23,379
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 是啊 - 来吧 臭屁屁
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- 'Course she will. - Come on, stinky trunks.

148
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,670
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我们来把你弄干净
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Let's get you cleaned up.

149
00:20:31,212 --> 00:20:32,462
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}来了
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}There we go.

150
00:20:33,712 --> 00:20:35,670
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}乖
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Hey!

{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}凯伊
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Kay!

154
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:56,504
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}乖 萝西
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Hey, Rosie.

155
00:21:00,879 --> 00:21:02,962
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}凯伊 头靠在我身上
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Kay, give me your head.

156
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:06,379
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}好了 嘘...
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}All right. Shh...

157
00:21:09,212 --> 00:21:11,170
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}嘘
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Shh.

158
00:22:05,212 --> 00:22:07,504
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 凯伊 深呼吸 - 停车
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- Kay? Just breathe. - Stop the car.

159
00:22:07,587 --> 00:22:09,170
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 看着我 - 停车
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- Look at me now. - Stop the car!

160
00:22:09,254 --> 00:22:11,670
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 我们需要冷静下来... - 让我出去
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- We need to keep calm... - Let me out now!

161
00:22:11,754 --> 00:22:13,212
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}天啊 等等
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Jesus! Wait!

162
00:22:15,795 --> 00:22:16,920
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}妈啊
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Christ!

163
00:22:21,504 --> 00:22:22,670
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}凯伊
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Kay.

164
00:22:23,545 --> 00:22:24,587
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}凯伊
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Kay.

165
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:26,129
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}听着 你能否...
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Hey, listen. Will you just...

{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}你他妈的别碰我
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Fuckin' don't touch me!

167
00:22:28,504 --> 00:22:30,670
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}安迪 你控制不了这个的
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Andy, you can't control this.

168
00:22:31,462 --> 00:22:33,712
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}你根本无法替我治好这鬼玩意
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}You don't fucking keep this from me!

169
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,545
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我们还要拖多久？直到我攻击你？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}How long were you going to play along for? What, until I turn on you?

170
00:22:38,629 --> 00:22:40,129
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 还是她？- 不
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- On her? - No.

171
00:22:40,212 --> 00:22:41,837
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 你必须带她走 - 你是什么意思？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- You must take her. - What?

172
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,170
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 你在说什么？要我离开你？小蓝？- 你得带她走
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- What are you talking about? Leaving you? - You must take her.

173
00:22:45,254 --> 00:22:46,879
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}住口 别说了
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Stop. Just stop.

174
00:22:48,129 --> 00:22:49,254
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}够了
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Come on.

175
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,212
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我在这里 好吗？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}I'm here, all right?

176
00:22:57,795 --> 00:22:59,129
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}不会有事的
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}It'll be all right.

177
00:23:20,129 --> 00:23:21,670
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}来吧 我拉你起来
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Come on, let's get you up.

178
00:23:23,254 --> 00:23:25,045
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我们不去医院
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}We're not going to the hospital.

179
00:23:25,129 --> 00:23:26,045
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我们就快到了
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}We are so close.

180
00:23:26,129 --> 00:23:29,004
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}那会让你和萝西离这条河更远
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}It puts you and Rosie further from the river.

181
00:23:31,254 --> 00:23:32,920
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我们现在什么也没有了
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}There's nothing there for us now.

182
00:23:33,004 --> 00:23:35,587
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我们有时间 看到这个了吗？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Yeah there is. Time is there. See this?

183
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:38,962
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}这是你剩下的时间 我们要把握每分每秒
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}That's yours. All of it, every second, and we're gonna make it count.

184
00:23:39,754 --> 00:23:42,254
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}但若你一直流血 很快就会变成行尸的
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}But if you bleed out, you'll turn sooner.

185
00:23:43,212 --> 00:23:44,962
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}要让我做决定 记得吗？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}It's my call, remember?

186
00:23:45,295 --> 00:23:47,670
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}所以我就无权说话？我没选择权？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}So I get no say in that? I don't have a choice?

187
00:23:47,754 --> 00:23:49,337
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}对 亲爱的 你没有权利
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}No, sweetheart, you don't.

188
00:24:03,837 --> 00:24:04,962
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}凯伊
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Kay.

189
00:24:05,504 --> 00:24:06,754
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我不能那么做
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}I can't do that.

190
00:24:07,545 --> 00:24:09,170
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}小心 当心这只脚
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Watch the leg.

191
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:43,962
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}该死
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Shit!

192
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:05,420
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}凯伊？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Kay?

193
00:25:09,212 --> 00:25:10,462
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}萝西？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Rosie?

194
00:25:17,212 --> 00:25:19,254
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}嘿 还好吗？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Hey, how're we doing?

195
00:25:19,337 --> 00:25:20,962
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}萝西？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Rosie? Rose.

{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}等等
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Hey.

{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}你这家伙
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Hey!

217
00:30:02,337 --> 00:30:03,837
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}你知道自己刚做了什么吗？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Do you know what you just did?

218
00:30:08,337 --> 00:30:10,504
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}你离我远点 不准过来
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}You stay away. Stay back.

219
00:30:12,629 --> 00:30:14,045
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}离我爸远一点
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Leave my dad alone!

220
00:32:32,462 --> 00:32:34,670
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}那玩意显示剩下多少时间？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}What's the count left on that business?

221
00:32:35,379 --> 00:32:36,504
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}嗯...
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Uh...

{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}差不多还有46小时
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}It's 46 hours, give or take.

{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}让我看看你的手臂
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Give us your arm.

225
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,170
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}这恐怕起不了多大作用
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Won't do much, I'm afraid.

226
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:18,212
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}但或许能帮把你的伤口藏起来
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}But it might help you hide it.

227
00:33:19,087 --> 00:33:21,129
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}最好把伤口都包起来
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Best to do that around these parts.

228
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,504
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}没事了 亲爱的
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}It's all right, darling.

{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}大家都叫我爱塔
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Folks call me Etta.

233

{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我叫安迪
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Andy.

234
00:33:45,754 --> 00:33:49,087
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}这地方看起来比地图上小很多
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}This place looked bigger on the map.

235
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:52,129
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 我们总是让人失望 - 医院是不是...
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- We never fail to disappoint. - The hospital, is it...

236
00:33:52,212 --> 00:33:55,170
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 那称不上医院 只是隔壁的一栋楼 - 好的
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- That's a generous description. It's the next building over. - Um.

237
00:33:55,254 --> 00:33:57,962
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}那里没剩什么了 他们几年前削减了我们的资金
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}There's not much left. They cut our funding years back.

238
00:33:58,045 --> 00:34:00,970
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 你是个老师？- 曾经是
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- Are you a teacher? - I was.

239
00:34:02,587 --> 00:34:04,420
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}你的学生们都上哪去了？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Where are they now, your students?

240
00:34:04,504 --> 00:34:05,504
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}都走了
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Gone.

241
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:07,629
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}真遗憾
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}I'm sorry.

242
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:11,587
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}不是死了 是离开了去过传统的生活了
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}No, not dead. Gone. Living in the old ways.

243
00:34:12,379 --> 00:34:15,629
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}没什么好遗憾的 他们过得比我们其他人都好
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Nothing to be sorry about. They're doing better than the rest of us.

244
00:34:16,045 --> 00:34:18,629
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}全国各地的暴民都聚集在一起了
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Mobs from all over the country coming together.

245
00:34:19,087 --> 00:34:21,754
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}那些还有在联系的人都感觉到了
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}They sensed it, those who stayed connected.

246
00:34:24,087 --> 00:34:27,712
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}这里原本的居民都离开了 回他们自己的国家去
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}The whole community up and left back to their country.

247
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,295
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}若你想住在这里的话 这里还有多余的床
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}There's a spare bed if you want one.

248
00:34:42,504 --> 00:34:44,795
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}你怎么想 萝西？我们喜欢她吗？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}What do you think, Rosie? Do we like her?

{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Do we like her?

{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}I think we might like her.

{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 我们现在要拿这些做什么？- 要做矛吗？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- what are we gonna do with this? - Make spears?

259
00:36:32,254 --> 00:36:34,004
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}有点像妈妈做的意大利面 对吧？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Bit like Mom's spaghetti, eh?

260
00:36:34,087 --> 00:36:35,087
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}爸
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Dad!

{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}以前我们会从动物身上取得这个
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Back in the old days, we used to take this from an animal.

{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}最好让那宝宝安静一点
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Better keep that baby quiet too.

297
00:42:17,504 --> 00:42:21,379
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}听着 你把我弄出去 我也会带你离开这里？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Listen, how about you get me out of here and then I'll get you out of here?

298
00:42:21,462 --> 00:42:22,504
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}去哪里？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}To where?

299
00:42:23,045 --> 00:42:24,795
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}一个能让你稍微躲一下的地方
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}A place you could hole up for a bit.

300
00:42:26,295 --> 00:42:30,004
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}那小家伙还是要有女人照顾比较好
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}The little one, be real nice for the wife to have that around.

301
00:42:35,545 --> 00:42:38,462
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}你最好想快一点 把我拉出来
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}You better think fast. Tow it off me.

302
00:42:38,545 --> 00:42:39,545
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}该死
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Shit.

303
00:42:39,629 --> 00:42:41,254
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 快点 - 你有钥匙吗？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- Come on. - Got the keys?

304
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:55,962
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}你别搞我
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Don't you fuck me.

305
00:43:17,587 --> 00:43:19,004
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}好家伙 拿着这个
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Good man. Take this.

306
00:44:00,962 --> 00:44:02,170
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}来吧 我们走
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Come on. Let's go.

307
00:44:11,504 --> 00:44:13,920
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}这家伙在公路上挥手要搭我的便车
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Flagged me down on the highway, this bloke.

308
00:44:14,004 --> 00:44:16,212
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}他被一些挖土人困住了
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Put himself in a spot with some diggers.

309
00:44:17,629 --> 00:44:18,712
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}你好
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Hello.

310
00:44:20,004 --> 00:44:21,129
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}你好
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Hello.

311
00:44:21,629 --> 00:44:23,545
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}乖女孩 闭上你的眼睛
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Attagirl. Close your eyes.

312
00:44:34,704 --> 00:44:35,734
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}挺不错的
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}It's nice.

313
00:44:37,984 --> 00:44:39,134
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}不 这很美丽
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}No, it's beautiful.

314
00:44:40,254 --> 00:44:41,837
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}萝伦会带你去安顿一下
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Rainey'll get you settled.

315
00:44:52,045 --> 00:44:53,754
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我能放她下来吗？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Do you mind if I put her down?

316
00:45:17,504 --> 00:45:19,670
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}他不曾带人回来的
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}He doesn't bring people back.

317
00:45:19,754 --> 00:45:22,420
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我们很高兴成为他的例外 对吧？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Well, we're very glad he made an exception, aren't we?

318
00:45:25,504 --> 00:45:26,629
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}谢谢
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Thanks.

319
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:34,087
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 那就是我们在这里的原因 - 因为天然气？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- That's why we're here. - What, the gas?

320
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,920
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}维克已经规划好回归正轨后的生活
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Vic has plans for when things get back to normal.

321
00:45:38,545 --> 00:45:41,170
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}根本不会有这种事 对吧？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}It's not going to happen. Is it?

322
00:45:42,045 --> 00:45:44,004
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我觉得应该没那么快
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}I don't think normal is on the horizon.

323
00:45:46,087 --> 00:45:48,462
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}（危险 高压天然气管）

324
00:45:49,587 --> 00:45:51,212
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}你们在天然气公司工作吗？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}You worked on the lines?

325
00:45:51,712 --> 00:45:53,004
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我在食堂工作
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}In the canteen.

326
00:45:54,129 --> 00:45:55,295
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我负责做菜
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}I cooked.

327
00:45:55,837 --> 00:45:58,379
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}这是最重要的工作
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Right, well, that's the most important job of all.

328
00:45:58,962 --> 00:46:00,379
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}男人一定都很爱你
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Men must have loved you.

329
00:46:01,254 --> 00:46:02,462
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}曾经有个人很爱我
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}One did.

330
00:46:11,254 --> 00:46:13,379
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}你是我看见的第一个活人
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}You're the first people I've seen.

331
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:17,754
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}第一个还是人的人类
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}The first people who are still people.

332
00:46:19,629 --> 00:46:21,212
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}是啊
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Yeah.

333
00:46:27,379 --> 00:46:28,962
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}好了 老兄 我们走吧
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}All right, mate, let's go.

334
00:46:29,462 --> 00:46:31,462
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}他们才刚到 维克
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}They've only just arrived, Vic.

335
00:46:32,545 --> 00:46:34,504
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}若他习惯了 就会离不开了
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Well, if he's in, he's all the way in.

336
00:46:36,087 --> 00:46:38,962
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}萝伦会照顾她 带她上去 抱抱她
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Rainey'll look after her. Take her up there, cuddle her.

337
00:46:39,045 --> 00:46:40,587
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}她根本不会知道你离开了
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Won't even notice you're gone.

338
00:46:43,462 --> 00:46:44,754
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我会保护她的安全
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}I'll keep her safe.

339
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:49,420
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}很好
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Great.

340
00:46:51,795 --> 00:46:53,212
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}拜托照顾好她
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Please look after her.

341
00:46:53,795 --> 00:46:54,837
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}好吗？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Okay.

342
00:46:56,879 --> 00:46:58,629
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}来吧 萝西 这是...
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Come on, Rosie. This is...

343
00:47:00,087 --> 00:47:01,170
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 没问题吧？- 妈妈
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- You okay? - Mama!

344
00:47:01,254 --> 00:47:02,420
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}好
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Yes.

345
00:47:02,504 --> 00:47:03,504
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}乖
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Hey.

346
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:04,795
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}这能让她冷静下来
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}This calms her down.

347
00:47:07,504 --> 00:47:08,545
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}好的
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Okay.

348
00:47:09,545 --> 00:47:11,170
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 好了... - 回头见
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- All right... - See you soon.

349
00:47:11,254 --> 00:47:12,254
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}是啊
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Yeah.

350
00:47:13,254 --> 00:47:14,337
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}回头见
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Yeah.

351
00:47:21,879 --> 00:47:24,920
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}（反对提炼天然气？滚出去吧 ）

352
00:47:32,254 --> 00:47:33,254
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}维克
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Vic.

353
00:47:35,254 --> 00:47:36,379
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}这是什么？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}What's this?

354
00:47:39,254 --> 00:47:40,504
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}用过这玩意吗？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Ever used one of these?

355
00:47:41,212 --> 00:47:42,254
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}没有
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}No.

356
00:47:47,212 --> 00:47:48,462
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}往前站 站45度角
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Move forward. Stand forty - five.

357
00:47:50,295 --> 00:47:52,254
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}和目标物呈45度
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Forty - five degrees to the target.

358
00:47:52,337 --> 00:47:54,379
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}然后顶在肩窝...
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Now move the stock into your shoulder...

359
00:47:54,462 --> 00:47:55,920
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我们要射杀他们？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}We're going to shoot them?

360
00:47:56,795 --> 00:47:57,837
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}没错
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Yeah.

361
00:47:58,712 --> 00:48:02,170
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}反正你也不会想亲他们 对吧？现在把脸颊贴在垫腮板上
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}You're not gonna kiss 'em, are ya? Now cheek to the cheek plate.

362
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:04,545
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}如果目标变得模糊 代表你做对了
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}If the target's blurry, you're doing it right.

363
00:48:05,129 --> 00:48:06,420
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 是吗？- 懂了吗？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- Yeah? - You got it?

364
00:48:06,754 --> 00:48:10,212
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 我不太确定 可能吧 - 先压着扳机 但别扣下
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- Uh, I'm not sure. I think so. - Squeeze the trigger but don't pull it.

365
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:11,587
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 真的吗？- 没错
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- Really? - Yeah.

366
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:15,295
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}若你扣了板机 准心就会跑掉 试试看吧
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}If you pull it, then you throw your sights out. So back up.

367
00:48:15,837 --> 00:48:17,045
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}现在压着扳机
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Now squeeze.

368
00:48:17,129 --> 00:48:20,587
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}会越来越紧 继续压...
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Feel the resistance. Squeeze...

369
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:23,670
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}好了
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}All right.

370
00:48:25,587 --> 00:48:29,670
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}现在继续射击直到对方倒下 除非全都打倒了... 否则别停下来
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Now keep shooting till you drop him... and don't stop till we got 'em all.

371
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:38,212
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}快点 我可帮不了你 老兄
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Come on, I can't carry you, mate.

372
00:49:16,212 --> 00:49:17,754
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我以为我们是为了天然气而来
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}I thought we were here for gas.

373
00:49:17,837 --> 00:49:20,879
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 这叫额外的收入 - 那她怎么办？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- Call it a side earner. - What's that got to do with her?

374
00:49:21,545 --> 00:49:23,420
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}没有鱼饵 鱼就上不了钩
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Can't catch a fish without bait.

375
00:49:23,879 --> 00:49:27,295
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}当国家回到正轨 大家就会开始有物欲
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}When this country gets back on track, people are gonna want things.

376
00:49:28,379 --> 00:49:31,045
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}能控制市场 能源 天然气...
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Whoever controls the market, power, gas...

377
00:49:32,004 --> 00:49:34,837
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}拥有闪亮亮的东西的... 人就能享受安乐的生活
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}all the shiny shit... will be sitting pretty.

378
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:38,795
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}打铁要趁热嘛
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}I'm just making hay while the sun shines.

379
00:49:38,879 --> 00:49:40,545
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}你想太多了 维克
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}The sun's not shining, Vic.

380
00:49:42,004 --> 00:49:43,170
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}什么对你来说才重要？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}What's it worth to ya?

381
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:46,545
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}一个让你和孩子安全的地方？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}A safe place for you and your kid?

382
00:49:57,379 --> 00:50:00,295
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}你只需要担心自己的女儿就好
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Only girl you need to be worried about is your own.

383
00:50:01,379 --> 00:50:02,420
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}把这个装满
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Fill it up.

384
00:50:20,337 --> 00:50:23,379
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}没事的
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Hey, it's okay.

385
00:50:23,462 --> 00:50:26,587
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}别怕 只是天然气快没了
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}No, just low on gas, that's all.

386
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:28,045
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}天然气快没了而已
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Just low on gas.

387
00:50:28,129 --> 00:50:29,712
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}嘘
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Shh.

388
00:50:30,587 --> 00:50:32,129
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}萝西
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Hey, Rosie.

389
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:06,087
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我告诉过你
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}I told you mob.

390
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:09,170
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}那些天然气井是我的 里面的东西也是我的
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}The wells are mine along with what's in 'em.

391
00:51:15,629 --> 00:51:16,920
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}若敢跟我斗...
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Fuck with me...

392
00:51:25,087 --> 00:51:26,420
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我就绝不会放过你
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}and I'll fuck with you.

393
00:51:33,837 --> 00:51:35,254

{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}There's no fixing what your father and I have.

490
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:40,295
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}有很多聪明的人都试过了
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Lots of other smart guys have tried.

491
01:06:46,045 --> 01:06:47,170
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}你要去哪里？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Where are you going?

492
01:06:47,254 --> 01:06:48,962
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我要去看个东西
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}I've gotta check something.

493
01:06:49,545 --> 01:06:50,837
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}看什么？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Check what?

494
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:52,545
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}图米 你要看什么？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Thoomi, check what?

495
01:06:53,129 --> 01:06:54,420
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我的老天
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}For fuck's sake.

496
01:07:04,962 --> 01:07:07,920
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}（威利）

497
01:08:29,795 --> 01:08:31,962
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}天啊 图米
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Jesus, Thoomi.

498
01:08:32,045 --> 01:08:33,045
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}快住手
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Hey, stop!

499
01:08:33,129 --> 01:08:34,337
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}走开
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Go away!

500
01:08:34,962 --> 01:08:37,629
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}这是缅怀仪式 你只是个愚蠢的“嘎把”
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}This is sorry business. You're just a stupid gubba.

501
01:08:37,712 --> 01:08:39,045
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}你什么都不懂
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}You don't know anything.

502
01:08:47,337 --> 01:08:48,504
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}那是我爸
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}That's my dad.

503
01:08:50,212 --> 01:08:54,254
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我们会把死者埋在树中 鬼魂就无法唤醒他们
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}We get buried in the trees so the ghosts can't wake us.

504
01:08:56,462 --> 01:08:58,337
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}他的灵魂仍不在他身上
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}His spirit's still loose.

505
01:08:58,420 --> 01:08:59,462
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}这都是我的错
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}It's my fault.

506
01:09:00,087 --> 01:09:01,337
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我浪费太多时间了
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}I took too long.

507
01:09:03,462 --> 01:09:04,545
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}不 不是你的错
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}No you didn't.

508
01:09:05,129 --> 01:09:07,379
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}你没有浪费太多时间 这不是你的错
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}No you didn't. This isn't your fault.

509
01:09:07,462 --> 01:09:10,337
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我把他绑在这里 好让我能把智者先生带来
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}I tied him here till I could bring the Clever Man back.

510
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:12,212
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}族人不该找到他的
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}They weren't supposed to find him.

511
01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:14,879
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}他们认为自己在做正确的事
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}They thought they were doing the right thing.

512
01:09:16,295 --> 01:09:17,379
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}他们做得也没错
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}They did.

513
01:09:19,045 --> 01:09:20,879
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}他已不再是你爸了
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}That wasn't your dad anymore.

514
01:09:22,587 --> 01:09:24,087
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}很遗憾 但他已经变了
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}I'm sorry, but it wasn't.

515
01:09:25,420 --> 01:09:28,879
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我应该把智者先生带来 而不是带你来
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}I should have been here, with him, not you.

516
01:09:35,379 --> 01:09:37,295
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}图米 我得走了 对不起
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Thoomi, I have to go. I'm sorry.

517
01:09:41,712 --> 01:09:44,045
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我觉得萝西希望你跟我们一起走
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}I think Rosie would like it if you came with us.

518
01:09:44,129 --> 01:09:45,879
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}你跟我们一起走的话 我会比较开心
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}I'd be happier if you did.

519
01:09:47,129 --> 01:09:50,170
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我根本不在乎你和你的女儿
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}I don't care about you or your baby.

520
01:09:53,962 --> 01:09:55,420
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我觉得你不是真心说这话的
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}I don't think you mean that.

521
01:10:09,337 --> 01:10:10,670
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}她不会有事的
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}She'll be okay.

522
01:10:12,045 --> 01:10:13,670
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}她不会有事的 该死
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}She'll be okay. Shit.

523
01:10:14,462 --> 01:10:15,629
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}该死
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Shit.

524
01:10:23,087 --> 01:10:24,629
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}（9小时2分钟）

525
01:11:24,504 --> 01:11:25,587
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}萝西？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Rosie?

526
01:11:29,587 --> 01:11:30,795
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}河往这边走
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}River's this way.

527
01:12:59,879 --> 01:13:01,129
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}你弄那些树叶干什么？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}What's with the leaves?

528
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:04,254
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}这样可以隐藏我的脚印
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}They hide my footprints.

529
01:13:06,129 --> 01:13:07,754
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}你怕谁看到？那些鬼吗？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}From who? The ghosts?

530
01:13:07,837 --> 01:13:09,379
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}不 我妈
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}No, my mom.

531
01:13:18,837 --> 01:13:20,004
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}有人吗？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Hello?

532
01:13:24,129 --> 01:13:25,170
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}饿吗？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Hungry?

533
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:45,587
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}太好了
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Yes.

534
01:13:47,004 --> 01:13:48,254
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}找到了
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Bingo.

535
01:13:50,295 --> 01:13:52,545
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}可能会有点刺痛
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}This might sting a little bit.

536
01:13:53,170 --> 01:13:54,129
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}伤口在哪边？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Where is it?

537
01:13:54,754 --> 01:13:55,962
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}这里吗？准备好了吗？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}There? Ready?

538
01:14:02,004 --> 01:14:03,129
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}你为什么要那么做？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Why'd you do that?

539
01:14:04,087 --> 01:14:05,295
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}那是传统的生活
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}It's from the old ways.

540
01:14:06,545 --> 01:14:07,879
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}但已经不再是我们的传统了
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}But not our ways anymore.

541
01:14:07,962 --> 01:14:09,462
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}为什么？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Then why?

542
01:14:11,045 --> 01:14:12,170
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}因为很痛
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}'Cause it hurts.

543
01:14:12,545 --> 01:14:15,837
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}当这里的伤口愈合 或许心里的伤口也会愈合
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}When this hurt heals, maybe this hurt heals too.

544
01:14:19,795 --> 01:14:21,295
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}住这里的人去哪里了？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Where did all the people go?

545
01:14:23,254 --> 01:14:24,462
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}应该没走远
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Not far.

546
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:26,254
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}食物还很新鲜
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}The food's still fresh.

547
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:28,462
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}你为什么要找他们？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Why do you want 'em?

548
01:14:28,837 --> 01:14:30,754
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}因为我想请他们帮忙
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}'Cause I want to ask them a favor.

549
01:14:30,837 --> 01:14:33,170
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}你女儿吗？他们会让她留下吗？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}About bub? Are they gonna keep her?

550
01:14:33,545 --> 01:14:36,004
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我们应该要想想你该怎么办
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}We should think about what we're gonna do with you.

551
01:14:36,087 --> 01:14:37,629
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}或许他们不会回来了
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Maybe they won't come back.

552
01:14:38,587 --> 01:14:39,920
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我觉得他们应该会
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}I think they will.

553
01:14:40,004 --> 01:14:41,212
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}要是他们没回来呢？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}What if they don't?

554
01:14:44,295 --> 01:14:45,587
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}那你就是我最后的希望了
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Then you're all I've got.

555
01:15:37,379 --> 01:15:38,420
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}你好？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Hello?

556
01:15:46,545 --> 01:15:47,754
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}露营车可以给你
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}The caravan's yours.

557
01:15:49,004 --> 01:15:50,837
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}只要你能发动 车子也给你
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Car too, if you can start it.

558
01:15:51,670 --> 01:15:53,045
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我需要的不是车子
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}It's not the car I need.

559
01:16:11,587 --> 01:16:12,545
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}听着
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Look.

560
01:16:14,087 --> 01:16:16,045
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我有六发子弹 好吗？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}I've got six, okay?

561
01:16:17,004 --> 01:16:19,629
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}若你变成行尸 最后两颗留给你
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}The last two are yours, if you go that way.

562
01:16:19,712 --> 01:16:22,879
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}- 拜托你别那么做 - 不 我不能丢下他们
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}- Please, don't do that. - I can't leave them.

563
01:16:23,379 --> 01:16:25,587
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我会说到做到 所以...
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}I said I wouldn't and I won't, so...

564
01:16:29,295 --> 01:16:30,295
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}冷静点
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Hey.

565
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:34,545
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}你看 爸爸 那个人抱着宝宝
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Look, Daddy, that man has a baby!

566
01:16:35,337 --> 01:16:36,629
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}是啊
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Yes, he does.

567
01:16:39,795 --> 01:16:41,462
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我们跟宝宝说再见 好吗？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Should we say goodbye to the baby?

568
01:16:41,545 --> 01:16:42,837
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}好
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Yeah.

569
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:44,462
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}他们要走了
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}They're leaving now.

570
01:16:44,545 --> 01:16:46,629
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}再见 宝宝
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Bye bye, baby!

571
01:16:52,504 --> 01:16:53,629
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}老兄
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Hey, mate.

572
01:16:54,670 --> 01:16:55,754
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}你就用那两颗子弹吧
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Just take the two.

573
01:16:56,295 --> 01:16:57,420
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}就算是为了她好
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}For her sake.

574
01:17:08,837 --> 01:17:11,295
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我的海盗们在哪里？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Where's my pirate, ey?

575
01:17:11,879 --> 01:17:14,129
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我们要去寻找宝藏了吗？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}We gonna come and find this treasure?

576
01:17:14,212 --> 01:17:15,337
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}走吧
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Hey? Come on.

577
01:18:46,879 --> 01:18:48,004
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}爸
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Dad.

578
01:18:49,504 --> 01:18:50,754
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}爸爸
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Daddy.

579
01:18:58,712 --> 01:19:00,379
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}来抱抱 萝西
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Come here, Rosie.

580
01:19:04,712 --> 01:19:06,754
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}你好啊 图米
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Hey, Thoomi.

581
01:19:06,837 --> 01:19:07,837
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}你好 爸
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Hey.

582
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:10,795
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}你好啊
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Hey.

583
01:19:15,254 --> 01:19:17,004
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}你脚下的树叶呢？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}What's happened to your leaves?

584
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:19,462
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我想回家了
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}I wanna go home now.

585
01:19:20,379 --> 01:19:21,420
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}真的吗？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Really?

586
01:19:23,587 --> 01:19:24,879
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}你想见见我家人吗？
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}You want my people?

587
01:19:27,087 --> 01:19:28,045
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}好啊
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Yeah.

{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}我想
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs10}Yeah, I do.

589
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:38,504
{\fn方正黑体简体\fs16}图米 若我没能爬到山上 你...
