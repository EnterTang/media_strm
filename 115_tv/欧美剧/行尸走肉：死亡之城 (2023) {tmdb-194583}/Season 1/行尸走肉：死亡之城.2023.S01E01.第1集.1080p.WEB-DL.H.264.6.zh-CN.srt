1
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,410
我猜想我的声音早已没机会被你听见
I guess I'm losing hope that you can hear me.

2
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,300
但机会永远存在  不是吗
But there's always that chance, isn't there?

3
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,310
那渺茫的机会
That slim chance.

4
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,480
现在而言  一切机会都是渺茫的
It's all about slim chances now.

5
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,460
我试着把每件事做对
I tried to do everything right.

6
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,110
确保人们的安全
Keep people safe.

7
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:36,970
我尽力了  摩根
I tried, Morgan.

8
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,760
我尽力了
I tried.

9
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,670
我们的团体变得更小了
Our group's smaller now.

10
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,670
我们又失去了一员  就在前天
We lost another, day before last.

11
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,910
那是她的选择
It was her choice.

12
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,820
我并不能去责怪她
I won't say I blame her,

13
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:55,970
但她失去了生存的信念
But she lost faith.

14
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,620
疾控中心那是条死路
The C.D.C. was a dead end.

15
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,170
我在那里遇见了一个男人
I met a man there,

16
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,070
一位科学家
A scientist.

17
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,500
他对我说了一些事
He told me something.

18
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,030
他对我说...
He told me...

19
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,820
那已经无关紧要了
It doesn't matter.

20
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,900
重点是  我们要前进了
What matters is we're moving on.

21
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,390
亚特兰大这边沦陷了
Atlanta's done.

22
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,360
我们要去本宁堡军事基地那边
We're gonna try for fort benning.

23
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,340
我们要面对一个漫长艰险的旅途
We're facing a long hard journey,

24
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,030
也许比我想象中还要来的艰难
maybe even harder than I can imagine.

25
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,270
但它并不会比我们至今经历的困难
But it can't be harder than our journey's been so far.

26
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,230
不是吗
Can it?

27
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,140
125里路...
125 miles...

28
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,880
还有这么长的路要赶
That's what lies ahead.

29
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,190
我试着不丧失信念
And I'm trying hard not to lose faith.

30
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,790
我也不能丧失  否则  其他的人...
I can't. If I do, the others...

31
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,090
我的家庭  我的老婆...
My family, my wife...

32
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,600
我的儿子
My son.

33
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,470
我们现在剩下的人不多了
There's just a few of us now.

34
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,860
所以我们要万众一心
So we've got to stick together,

35
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,480
互相鼓励
fight for each other,

36
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,130
把我们的性命互相托付
be willing to lay down our lives for each other

37
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,600
如果情势所迫的话
if it comes to that.

38
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,750
小伙儿  出发吧
Son, let's saddle up.

39
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,150
这是我们唯一的机会
It's the only chance we've got.

40
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,470
摩根  你在外边小心点儿
Be careful out there, Morgan.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
希望你和杜安父子平安
I hope you and Duane are okay.

42
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,830
远离马路
Stay off the road.

43
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,320
别停下来
Keep moving.

44
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,870
眼观六路
Keep your eyes open.

45
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,410
我也不知该说啥
I don't know, just--

46
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,790
总之小心点儿
Just be safe.

47
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,880
本宁堡:乔治亚州西部城镇
也许我们能在本宁堡再相会
Maybe we'll see you in Fort Benning someday.

总监：lemony

68
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,540
刚想起和卡尔去大峡谷的那次旅行
Just thinking about our trip to the Grand Canyon with Carl.

69
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,260
我不记得这事儿了
I don't remember that.

70
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,560
不  你记不得  你那时只是个婴儿
No, you wouldn't. You were just a baby.

71
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,070
况且  我们其实连沃斯堡都还没到
Besides, we never made it past Fort Worth.
沃斯堡:德克萨斯州东北部城市

72
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,610
还真没  你那时病了
No, you got sick.

73
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,320
我从不知道婴儿能吐得这么厉害
I never knew a baby could throw up so much.

74
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,740
真恶心
Ick.

75
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,180
是啊  很恶心
Yeah, ick.

76
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,300
德州的医生说你能活下来
The doctor in Texas said you'd live.

77
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,940
所以我们就掉头回家了
Then we turned around and drove home.

78
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:56,790
真没劲儿
That sucks.

79
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,800
不  那次旅行很棒
No, it was a good trip.

80
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,000
最棒的一次
The best.

81
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,730
我们能去看看吗  去大峡谷
Can we go see it? The Grand Canyon?

82
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,840
我想去
I'd like to.

83
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,190
我也想去
I would too.

84
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,090
我们能去吗
Can we go?

85
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,030
去的话一定会带上你和你妈妈的
We'd never go without you and your mom.

86
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,450
我保证
That's a promise.

87
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,450
看起来很复杂啊
Looks complicated.

88
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,730
诀窍在于  怎么拆的
The trick is getting all these pieces

89
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,220
就怎么装回去
back together the same way.

90
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:37,880
我能把你的也清洗一下
I could clean yours,

91
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,370
给你示范一下
show you how.

92
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,330
真不错
Oh yeah.

93
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,810
这是把好枪
It's a sweet piece.

94
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,700
它是份礼物
It was a gift.

95
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,900
我爸爸送的
From my father.

96
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:01,200
他在我和艾米出门旅行前交给我的
He gave it to me just before amy and I took off on our road trip.

97
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:03,920
他说  两个姑娘出门在外
He said two girls on their own

98
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,680
要能够保护自己
should be able to defend themselves.

99
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,350
你爸爸是个聪明人
Smart man, your father.

100
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,210
你看这枪
Look, it's a--

101
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,680
这枪弹容有限
It's a limited capacity.

102
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,660
瞧  只能装七发子弹
See? Only holds seven rounds.

103
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,790
天呐
Oh Jeez.

104
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:23,680
这下完了
Aw no.

105
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,950
有路能过去吗
See a way through?

106
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,400
也许我们该往回走
Uh, maybe we should just go back.

107
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:59,030
-那边有跨州的辅路  -咱们油不够
- There's an interstate bypass.  - We can't spare the fuel.

108
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,430
天呐
Jeez.

109
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,690
我们能从这儿过去吗
Can we get through here?

110
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,600
我早就说过了  不是吗
I said it. Didn't I say it?

111
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,220
说了几千遍了  没水散热终究是不行的
A thousand times. Dead in the water.

112
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,450
有问题吗  戴尔
Problem, Dale?

113
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,290
没什么  不过是被困在在荒郊野外
Just a small matter of being stuck in the middle of nowhere

114
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,660
没有希望而已
with no hope of--

115
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,510
好吧  我说错了
Okay, that was dumb.

116
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,170
如果在这儿都找不到软胶管的话...
If you can't find a radiator hose here...

117
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,900
这里能找到一大堆东西呢
There's a whole bunch of stuff we can find.

118
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,840
我可以用水管多抽出点燃料以便启动
I can siphon more fuel from these cars for a start.

119
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,420
-也许能还能找到水  -或者食物
- Maybe some water. - Or food.

120
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,730
这是个坟场
This is a graveyard.

121
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,570
我真不知道自己作何感受
I don't know how I feel about this.

122
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,190
好了好了  开始吧
All right, all right, here we go.

123
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,440
大家赶紧  看看周围
Come on, y'all. Just look around,

124
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,560
收集能利用的一切东西
gather what you can.

125
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,060
孩子们  别去看它
Kids, don't look.

126
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,180
-要哪个  -平头螺丝刀
- Which one? - The flathead.

127
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,830
散热片软管的夹片从来都用平头的
Radiator hose clamp is always a flathead.

128
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,120
给  你来弄
Here, you do it.

129
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,140
学点技术
Learn something.

130
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,720
爱德从不让我穿这样漂亮的衣服
Ed never let me wear nice things like this.

131
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,530
我们会需要这些衣服的
We're gonna need clothes.

132
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:37,920
卡尔
Hey, Carl.

133
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,530
别离开我的视线  好吗
Always within my sight, okay?

134
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,900
你也是  索菲亚
You too, Sophia.

135
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,270
一切安好
It's all good.

136
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,640
好吧
Okay.

137
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,700
我能行的
All right.

138
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,410
格伦
Glenn.

139
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,560
我们缺水吗
Were we short on water?

140
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,190
给我留点
Save me some!

141
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,000
这简直像在接受洗礼  伙计
It's like being baptized, man.

142
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,610
我的上帝
Oh christ.

143
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,730
洛莉  躲到车底下
Lori, under the cars.

144
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,820
卡尔  索菲亚  赶快趴下
Carl, Sophia, get down now.

145
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,740
卡尔和索菲亚  索菲亚
Carl and Sophia. Sophia.

146
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,330
嘘  到下面来
Shh shh. Get under.

147
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:44,640
怎么回事
What?

148
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:46,930
小声点
Shh.

149
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,340
洛莉
Lori.

150
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,650
有两个行尸在追我的孩子
There's two walkers are after my baby.

151
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,630
嘘  安静
Shh shh!

152
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,990
-你还好吗  没事吧  -开枪打它们
- Are you all right? Are you okay? - Shoot them!

153
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,550
不  不行
No. No!

154
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,180
那些在马路上的行尸会听见的
Those walkers on the road would hear it.

155
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,490
那时就不止两个了  会有几百个过来
Then it wouldn't be just two, it'd be hundreds.

156
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,790
来我这  快点
Come here. Come on.

157
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,520
好了  在这等一下
All right, just hold here.

158
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,070
你别动  等着
You stay there. Wait.

159
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,750
快来
Come on.

160
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,300
索菲亚  你要完全按照我说的去做
Sophia, you have to do exactly as I say.

161
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,320
躲到那儿  越里面越好
Hide in there. Squeeze in tight.

162
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,550
-我去把它们引开  -不不  别丢下我
- I'll draw them away from you. - No no, don't leave me.

163
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,180
听我说  听我说
Listen listen listen listen.

164
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,360
它们不会气喘吁吁  而我会
They don't get winded. I do.

165
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,170
每次我只能解决其中的一个
I can only deal with them one at a time.

166
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,570
所以我就没法保护你
I wouldn't be able to protect you.

167
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,790
只有这样我们才能都活下来  明白吗
This is how we both survive. You understand?

168
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:22,050
好吗  去  去躲起来
Okay? Go go go go.

169
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,380
要是我没能回来  你就跑回公路去
If I don't make it back, run back to the highway,

170
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,630
从我们来的路直接跑回去找其他人
back to the others straight the way we came.

171
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,550
保证阳光落在你的左肩上
Keep the sun on your left shoulder.

172
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,310
来啊
Come on!

173
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,940
你们这些丑陋的狗崽子  来啊
You ugly son of a bitch. Come on!

174
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,830
来啊
Come on!

175
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,760
来啊
Come on!

176
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,890
过来
Come on!

177
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,430
快来啊
Come on!

178
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,580
你确定是这里吗
You sure this is the spot?

179
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,150
我就将她留在这里的
I left her right here.

180
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,530
我将行尸们沿着小河向上游引走了
I drew the walkers way off in that direction up the creek.

181
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,990
也没有船桨使唤  估计也就是这地方了
Without a paddle-- seems where we've landed.

182
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,550
我回来的时候她已经走了
She was gone by the time I got back here.

183
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:22,540
我以为她刚刚离开去找其他人了
I figured she just took off and ran back to the group.

184
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,760
我告诉她沿着那条路
I told her go that way

185
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,550
并且要保证阳光落在左肩上
and keep the sun on her left shoulder.

186
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,870
小短腿  站那边去
Hey, short round, why don't you step off to one side?

187
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,150
你这样会毁掉踪迹的
You're mucking up the trail.

188
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:33,880
希望她分得清左右
Assuming she knows her left from her right.

189
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,550
肖恩  她明白我说的话
Shane, she understood me fine.

190
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,810
她又累又害怕  伙计
Kid's tired and scared, man.

191
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,800
她刚刚从两个行尸身边死里逃生
She had her a close call with two walkers.

192
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:41,890
你说的话有多少能起作用很值得怀疑
Got to wonder how much of what you said stuck.

193
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,750
这里有清晰的脚印
Got clear prints right here.

194
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,100
她按你说的做了  向公路边走去
She did like you said, headed back to the highway.

195
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,290
我们分散开沿来路返回
Let's spread out, make our way back.

196
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:49,670
她不可能走太远的
She couldn't have gone far.

197
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,090
我们会找到她的
Hey, we gonna find her.

198
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,270
她一定是藏在某个灌树丛中
She'll be tuckered out hiding in a bush somewhere.

199
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,730
到这之前她都没问题
She was doing just fine till right here.

200
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,190
她就一直走着
All she had to do was keep going.

201
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:11,340
但从这里她就向那边偏离了
She veered off that way.

202
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,240
为什么要这么做
Why would she do that?

203
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:16,060
也许是看到什么东西  受到惊吓
Maybe she saw something that spooked her,

204
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:16,940
被迫向那边跑去
made her run off.

205
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:17,970
行尸吗
A walker?

206
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,840
看不到其他脚印啊
I don't see any other footprints.

207
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,920
只有她的
Just hers.

208
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,360
现在怎么办  我们所有人再继续找下去吗
So what do we do? All of us press on?

209
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,150
不行  最好是你和格伦回到公路那边
No, better if you and Glenn get back up to the highway.

210
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,000
否则其他人会惊慌失措的
People are gonna start panicking.

211
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:32,940
告诉他们我们正在尽力追踪她的踪迹
Let them know we're on her trail doing everything we can.

212
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,640
但是最重要的是  让大家保持冷静
But most of all, keep everybody calm.

213
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,530
我会让他们继续在车辆之中搜寻宝物
I'll keep 'em busy scavenging cars.

214
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,680
想些其他的事情  我会让他们保持忙碌的
Think up a few other chores. I'll keep 'em occupied.

215
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,010
走吧
Come on.

216
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,960
我们为什么不一起出去找
Why aren't we all out there looking?

217
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,160
为什么要把车子挪开
Why are we moving cars?

218
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,690
我们必须清理出足够的空间
We have to clear enough room so I can get the R.V.

219
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:19,470
这样房车修好之后才能掉头
turned around as soon as it's running.

220
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:21,370
既然有了燃料  我们可以原路返回
Now that we have fuel we can double back

221
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:24,400
往格伦在地图上标记的那个支路上开
to a bypass that Glenn flagged on the map.

222
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,510
比起清理这些破烂玩意
Going back's going to be

223
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,760
原路返回要容易的多
easier than trying to get through this mess.

224
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,350
在我女儿回来之前  我们哪也不能去
We're not going anywhere till my daughter gets back.

225
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,290
那还用说
Hey, that goes without saying.

226
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,170
瑞克和达里尔已经去找了不是吗
Rick and daryl, they're on it, okay?

227
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:37,130
-只是时间问题  -越快越好
- Just a matter of time. - Can't be soon enough for me.

228
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,100
我仍然对路过我们的那群畜生心有余悸
I'm still freaked out from that herd that passed us by,

229
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:42,660
-不管你们叫它什么  -那是什么情况
- or whatever you'd call it. - Yeah, what was that?

230
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,400
像游街一样走过去
All of them just marching along like that.

231
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,730
畜生  还真是那么回事
A herd. That sounds about right.

232
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,340
我们之前也遇到过
We've seen it.

233
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,620
跟那晚帐篷遭到的攻击一样
It's like the night camp got attacked.

234
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,520
一群行尸而已  没上次那么多罢了
Some wadering pack, only fewer.

235
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,410
好了
Okay.

236
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,610
干活吧  我们还有很多事要做
Come on, people. We still got a lot to do.

237
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,690
别闲着  来吧
Let's stay on it. Let's go, come on.

238
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,190
足迹消失了
Tracks are gone.

239
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,150
没有  只是变模糊了
No, they're faint,

240
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,270
并没有消失
But they ain't gone.

241
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:20,790
她来过这
She came through here.

242
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,410
你怎么知道的
How can you tell?

243
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,640
除了泥土和杂草我什么也看不到
I don't see anything. Dirt, grass.

244
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,930
你想让我给你上堂追踪课
You want a lesson in tracking

245
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:29,500
还是想赶紧找到那个女孩离开这
or you want to find that girl and get our ass off that interstate?

246
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,720
- 肖恩  - 卡尔  怎么了
- Shane. - Carl, what happened?

247
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:55,660
妈  我找到一个很酷的东西
Mon, I found something cool.

248
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,090
肖恩  你看
Shane, check it out.

249
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:00,970
是个武器匣
It's an arsenal.

250
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,620
确实很酷  送到戴尔那去吧
That's cool, bud. Go give 'em to Dale.

251
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,680
你看这个
Check this one out.

252
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,650
哇  是把斧头
Whoa, it's a hatchet.

253
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,190
小心点  别碰这些东西
be careful. Don't play with those.

254
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:09,900
真锋利啊
They're really sharp.

255
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:12,490
-你没听见我说的话吗  -我能留一个吗
- What did I just say? - Can I keep one?

256
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,350
-你疯了吗  -别这样
- Are you crazy? - No way.

257
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,920
肖恩  肖恩  让她给我留一个
Shane. Shane, tell her to let me keep one.

258
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:23,300
小兄弟  快送到戴尔那去  快
Hey, man, go give them all to dale now. Go.

259
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,110
-你那是什么态度  -什么
- What was that? - What was what?

260
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,590
你刚刚把他支走的口气
The way you blew him off just now.

261
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,860
你让他很难堪
You crushed him.

262
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,530
真不敢相信  你竟然对我这么冷淡
I don't believe you. You're giving me the cold shoulder?

263
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,900
这不是正和你意吗
Isn't that what you want?

264
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:53,350
你不是让我滚远点吗  让我离你们远点吗
Aren't you the one who said stay the hell away from him and you?

265
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,450
你忘记在疾控中心发生的事了吗
You forget what happened at the C.D.C.?

266
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:58,240
忘记你在娱乐室干的蠢事了吗
Your little meltdown in the rec room slip your mind?

267
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,830
-你打算...  -我打算干嘛
- When you tried-- - When I tried to what?

268
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:01,930
你认为我想干嘛
What do you think that was?

269
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,610
我很清楚你当时想干嘛
I think it is pretty plain what that was.

270
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:08,470
那是个错误  我承认
A mistake. One that I admit to.

271
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,960
我做过很多错事  洛莉
I have a few mistakes under my belt, Lori.

272
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,930
你也一样
So do you.

273
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,170
我不否认
No debate there.

274
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,710
可是肖恩  我们不能再这样下去了
But Shane, we need to stop this.

275
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,580
不然你觉得我准备新车干嘛
Why do you think I'm prepping my new ride?

276
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,430
我要走了
I'm leaving.

277
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,320
走
Leaving?

278
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,040
再也不回来了
As in gone for good.

279
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,410
一找到机会就悄悄离开
Gonna quietly slip away first chance I get.

280
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:40,100
"紧急预警系统已启动"
"The emergency alert system has been activated."

281
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:43,180
"民防办公室发布以下信息"
"The Office of Civil Defense has issued the following message:"

282
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,770
"立即终止常规广播"
"Normal broadcasting will cease immediately."

283
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:48,600
-"现在是非常时刻"  -这是当地信号吗
- "This is a civil emergency." - Is that a local signal?

284
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,470
信号源肯定在50英里之内
It's got to be within 50 miles of here.

285
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,910
"不惜一切代价避免感染  保持镇定"
"Avoid anyone infected at all costs. Remain calm."

286
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:55,370
"救援马上就到"
"Help is on the way."

287
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,540
"紧急预警系统已启动"
"The emergency alert system has been activated."

288
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,330
"民防办公室..."
"The Office of Civil Defense..."

289
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,040
去他妈的
Asshole.

290
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,860
好了  继续干活吧
Okay, let's get back to work.

291
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,210
索菲亚
Sophia!

292
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:18,920
你在找什么
What are you looking for?

293
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:21,750
指甲里有皮肤残屑
Skin under the fingernails.

294
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,290
它刚用过餐
It fed recently.

295
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,530
牙缝里还有肉
There's flesh caught in its teeth.

296
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,260
那是什么肉啊
Yeah, what kind of flesh?

297
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,560
只有一种办法能够确定
Only one way to know for sure.

298
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:52,900
我来吧
Here, I'll do it.

299
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,630
你这辈子开过几次膛啊
How many kills you skin and gut in your life?

300
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:58,000
不管怎样  我这把更锋利
Anyway, mine is sharper.

301
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,180
接下来就比较恶心了
Now comes the bad part.

302
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:09,620
看来这王八蛋刚吃了顿大餐
Yeah, hoss had a big meal not long ago.

303
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,850
我能摸到
I feel it in there.

304
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,300
-胃给你  -我来吧
- here's the gut bag. - I got this.

305
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:47,400
这恶心的家伙午餐吃的是土拨鼠
This gross bastard had himself a woodchuck for lunch.

306
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:52,300
至少搞清楚了
At least we know.

307
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,730
至少搞清楚了
At least we know.

308
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:10,980
很晚了  天要黑了
It's late. Gonna be dark soon.

309
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,060
他们会找到她的
They'll find her.

310
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,110
我的手枪在哪儿
Where's my gun?

311
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:26,720
你没有权力拿走它
You have no right to take it.

312
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,440
你现在也用不着  不是吗
You don't need that just now, do you?

313
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,270
那是父亲给我的  它是我的
My father gave it to me. It's mine.

314
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:32,970
我先替你保管
I can hold onto it for you.

315
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,610
还是还给我吧
Or you can give it back to me.

316
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,020
怎么了
Everything cool?

317
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,490
没事  我只想要回我的枪
No, I want my gun back.

318
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,270
我觉得那不是个好主意
I don't think it's a good idea right now.

319
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:42,650
为什么
Why not?

320
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:47,270
我不愿意
I'm not comfortable with it.

321
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:53,910
事实是
The truth is,

322
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,540
营地里的流动枪支越少越好
less guns we have floating around camp the better.

323
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,600
你自己的武器上交了吗
You turning over your weapon?

324
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,650
没
No.

325
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,660
但我受过训练
But I'm trained in its use.

326
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,270
你们都需要接受枪支训练
That's what the rest of y'all need is proper training.

327
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:08,640
在那之前
But until that time I think

328
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,780
我觉得最好先让戴尔保管
it's best if Dale keeps them all accounted for.

329
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,460
到底怎么回事
Mind telling me what that's about?

330
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,920
天哪  他们回来了
Oh god, they're back.

331
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,210
你们没找到她吗
You didn't find her?

332
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,820
她的足迹中途消失了
Her trail went cold.

333
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,180
我们明天一早再去找
We'll pick it up again at first light.

334
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,760
你们不能把我女儿丢在荒郊野岭
You can't leave my daughter out there on her own

335
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,740
让她独自在丛林里过夜
to spend the night alone in the woods.

336
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:35,050
天黑了没法找
Out in the dark's no good.

337
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,950
容易伤着自己人
We'd just be tripping over ourselves.

338
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,190
会有更多人走失的
More people get lost.

339
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:40,550
但她只有十二岁  没法独自在外过夜
But she's 12. She can't be out there on her own.

340
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,670
-你们什么都没找到吗  -我知道你很难接受
- You didn't find anything? - I know this is hard.

341
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,150
但我希望你不要自乱阵脚
But I'm asking you not to panic.

342
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,540
我们知道她就在里面
We know she was out there.

343
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,050
我们找了很久
And we tracked her for a while.

344
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:49,460
我们得有计划地追踪
We have to make this an organized effort.

345
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,390
达里尔对丛林最熟悉
Daryl knows the woods better than anybody.

346
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,030
我把这件事交给他全权负责
I've asked him to oversee this.

347
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,490
那是血吗
Is that blood?

348
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:01,940
-我们击毙了一个行尸  -有行尸  我的老天
- We took down a walker. - Walker? Oh my god.

349
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,960
他没有碰到索菲亚
There was no sign it was ever anywhere near Sophia.

350
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,070
你怎么知道
How can you know that?

351
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:13,090
我们把那玩意剖开了
We cut the son of a bitch open,

352
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,310
已经确认过了
made sure.

353
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,450
天啊
Oh god.

354
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,580
你一开始就不应该把她丢在那
How could you just leave her out there to begin with?

355
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,500
你怎么可以离开她
How could you just leave her?

356
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,940
有两个行尸在追我们
Those two walkers were on us.

357
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:36,870
我得引开它们
I had to draw them off.

358
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:38,290
这样她才最安全
It was her best chance.

359
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:40,050
他真的别无选择  卡萝尔
Sounds like he didn't have a choice, Carol.

360
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:42,500
她要怎么才能自己找回来
How was she supposed to find her way back on her own?

361
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:45,690
她还是个孩子  她还是个孩子
She's just a child. She's just a child.

362
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:49,690
当时我真的别无选择  我只能这么做
It was my only option. The only choice I could make.

363
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,670
大家都相信你
I'm sure nobody doubts that.

364
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:01,780
我的小宝贝一个人在丛林里
My little girl got left in the woods.

365
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:36,050
大家每人拿一件武器
Everybody takes a weapon.

366
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,910
这不是我们需要的武器
These aren't the kind of weapons we need.

367
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,390
-枪呢  -我们讨论过这个问题了
- What about the guns? - We've been over that.

368
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,760
我  达里尔和瑞克拿枪
Daryl, Rick and I are carrying.

369
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,980
防止某人一听到风吹草动就狂放子弹
We can't have people popping off rounds every time a tree rustles.

370
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,740
风吹草动可吓不倒我
It's not the trees I'm worried about.

371
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,870
假如有人在不恰当的时机开枪
Say somebody fires at the wrong moment,

372
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,100
而那群畜生又恰巧经过
a herd happens to be passing by.

373
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,180
那我们就全部玩儿完了
See, then it's game over for all of us.

374
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,840
所以你就别想着拿枪了
So you need to get over it.

375
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:58,770
我的计划是沿河而上走五英里
The idea is to take the creek up about five miles,

376
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,430
然后掉头从河对岸再找回来
turn around and come back down the other side.

377
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:02,550
她很可能就在河边
Chances are she'll be by the creek.

378
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,300
那是她唯一熟悉的地方
It's her only landmark.

379
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,180
保持安静  提高警觉
Stay quiet and stay sharp.

380
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,240
彼此保持距离
Keep space between you

381
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,230
但不要离开大家的视线
but always stay within sight of each other.

382
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:11,170
大家收拾东西
Everybody assemble your packs.

383
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,250
戴尔
Dale.

384
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,210
你继续修车
Keep on those repairs.

385
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:15,250
我们得让这辆房车随时待命
We've got to get this R.V. ready to move.

386
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,680
我们可不会无故在这多待一分钟
We won't stay here a minute longer than we have to.

387
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,400
祝你们好运
Good luck out there.

388
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,490
把索菲亚找回来
Bring Sophia back.

389
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:24,960
帮我们照顾一下卡尔
Keep an eye on Carl while we're gone.

390
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,360
我要和你们一起去
I'm going with you.

391
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:28,830
你们需要人手  对吧
You need people, right?

392
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:30,200
这样才能搜寻更多的地方
To cover as much ground as possible.

393
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,070
你决定吧  坏人不能总让我当
Your call. I can't always be the bad guy.

394
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,360
所有人都能照看他
Well, he has all of you to look after him.

395
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,850
他应该会很安全
I'd say he's in good hands.

396
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,350
好吧  好吧
Okay. Okay.

397
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,690
跟大家一样  千万不要脱离我们的视线
But always within our sight, no exceptions.

398
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:02,220
安德莉亚  我求你了  不要逼我
Andrea, I'm begging you. Don't put me in this position.

399
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,850
拿不到枪  我是不会去的
I'm not going out there without my gun.

400
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,170
我也求你了
I'll even say please.

401
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,600
我这么做是为了你好
I'm doing this for you.

402
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:10,990
不  戴尔  你是为了自己
No, Dale, you're doing it for you.

403
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:14,520
别再这样了  你觉得我会怎么做
You need to stop. What do you think's gonna happen?

404
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,490
你一把枪还给我
I'm gonna stick it in my mouth

405
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,580
我就会把它伸进嘴里  饮弹自尽吗
and pull the trigger the moment you hand it to me?

406
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:19,820
我知道你在生我的气
I know you're angry at me.

407
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,170
我明白你的意思
That much is clear.

408
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:24,190
但如果我当时不那么做的话
But if I hadn't done what I did,

409
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:26,410
你已经死了
you'd be dead now.

410
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:29,100
詹纳给了我们选择的机会  我选择留下
Jenner gave us an option. I chose to stay.

411
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:29,830
你选择自杀
You chose suicide.

412
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:32,100
那跟你有什么关系  你根本就不了解我
So what's that to you? You barely know me.

413
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,630
我知道艾米的死让你伤心欲绝
I know Amy's death devastated you.

414
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,510
别扯上她
keep her out of this.

415
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:37,580
这跟艾米没关系  这是我们之间的事
This is not about Amy. This is about us.

416
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:41,160
如果我觉得没有活下去的意义
And if I decided that I had nothing left to live for,

417
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,240
你他妈有什么资格阻止我
who the hell are you to tell me otherwise?

418
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,400
逼着我放弃自己的选择
To force my hand like that?

419
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,980
-我救了你  -不  戴尔
- I saved your life. - No, Dale.

420
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,400
是我救了你  是你逼我的
I saved yours. You forced that on me.

421
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:53,240
我不想让你为了我而送命
I didn't want your blood on my hands

422
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,480
那是我离开那座大楼的唯一理由
and that is the only reason I left that building.

423
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:58,530
你以为会怎样  你以为我会幡然顿悟
What did you expect? What, I'd have some kind of epiphany?

424
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:00,610
想要坚定地活下去吗
Some life-affirming catharsis?

425
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,510
也许会心存感激
Maybe just a little gratitude.

426
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:04,460
感激
Gratitude?

427
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:07,210
我想在爆炸中死去
I wanted to die my way,

428
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,760
而不是被那些流着口水的怪物撕碎
not torn apart by drooling freaks.

429
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,100
那才是我的选择
That was my choice.

430
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:14,930
你剥夺了我选择的权利  戴尔
You took that away from me, Dale.

431
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,940
-但是...  -你觉得很了解我吗
- But-- - But you know better?

432
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:22,450
自从我妹妹死了之后
All I wanted after my sister died was to get out

433
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:25,130
我一心只想从这无尽的噩梦中解脱出来
of this endless horrific nightmare we live every day.

434
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:27,390
我没有伤害到其他人
I wasn't hurting anyone else.

435
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,040
你剥夺了我选择的权利  戴尔
You took my choice away, Dale.

436
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:34,160
你还期待我态度好点?
And you expect gratitude?

437
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,880
我不知道要说什么了
I don't know what to say.

438
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:46,510
我不是你女儿
I'm not your little girl.

439
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,260
不是你老婆  肯定也不是你的负担
I'm not your wife. And I am sure as hell not your problem.

440
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,900
这就是我要说的
That's all there is to say.

441
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:30,910
沙恩  看
Shane, look.

442
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,140
老爸说我可以拿着它  老妈说只要我
Dad said I could carry it and mom said as long as I was--

443
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,620
小点声  我们在找索菲亚
Keep it down. We're looking for sophia.

444
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,460
注意力放在找人上
You need to focus on the task.

445
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,670
-跟上  -跟着呢
- Got to keep up. - I am.

446
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:49,650
-没事吧  -我觉得沙恩讨厌我
- You okay? - I think shane's mad at me.

447
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,130
-我做错事了吗  -没
- Did I do something wrong? - No.

448
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,670
真的没有  宝贝  我保证
No, honey, I promise you.

449
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:58,310
他只是  只是担心索菲亚  仅此而已
He's just-- he's worried about Sophia, that's all.

450
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:20,300
走  她可能在里面
Come on. She could be in there.

451
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:23,350
里面也可能有其他东西
Could be a whole bunch of things in there.

452
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:03,400
卡萝尔
Carol.

453
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:10,260
轻声叫
Call out softly.

454
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:14,020
如果她在里面  让她第一个听到你的声音
If she's in there, yours is the first voice she should hear.

455
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:18,760
索菲亚  宝贝
Sophia, sweetie,

456
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:20,290
你在里面吗
Are you in there?

457
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,500
索菲亚  我是妈妈
Sophia, it's mommy.

458
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:26,400
索菲亚  我们都在这儿  宝贝
Sophia. We're all here, baby.

459
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:27,290
我是妈妈
It's mommy.

460
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,420
达里尔
Daryl?

461
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:09,500
达里尔
Daryl?

462
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,700
不是她
It ain't her.

463
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,070
-谁在里面  -无名氏
- What's in there? - Some guy.

464
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,820
像詹纳说的那样  选择退出了
Did what Jenner said. Opted out.

465
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:28,210
他是这么说的吧
Ain't that what he called it?

466
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:42,940
哪个方向
What direction?

467
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:45,580
我想是那边  我肯定
I think that way. I'm pretty sure.

468
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,380
见鬼  在这里很难辨别
Damn, it's hard to tell out here.

469
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,290
我们都听到了  索菲亚肯定也听到了
If we heard them, maybe sophia did too.

470
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:52,530
有人在敲钟  也许是在召集什么人
Someone's ringing those bells, maybe calling others.

471
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:53,810
或是表明他们已经找到了她
Or signaling they found her.

472
00:45:53,810 --> 00:45:56,220
也许是她自己敲的  快走
She could be ringing them herself. Come on

473
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,760
你不去修引擎吗
Ain't you supposed to be fixing that radiator?

474
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:05,270
要是他们带着索菲亚回来
What if they come back with Sophia

475
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:06,770
瑞克想继续前进怎么办
And Rick wants to move on right away?

476
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:11,500
-昨天我就修好了  -什么
- I had it fixed yesterday. - What?

477
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,590
那又磨又搓是为什么
What was all that rubbing and sanding for then?

478
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:16,840
-是你胡说的吗  -可以这么说
- That's just bullshit? - Yeah, that's one word.

479
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:20,300
也可以说是演哑剧
Another word would be pantomime--

480
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,270
只是为了现一下
Just for show.

481
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,960
别告诉别人
No one else needs to know that.

482
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:28,430
哑剧
Pantomime.

483
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,390
要是其他人知道车修好了
If the others know we're mobile,

484
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,220
他们又会组织起来继续走
They'll want to mobilize and move on.

485
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:36,140
那么你觉得他们找不到索菲亚  是吗
So you don't think they're gonna find sophia, that it?

486
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:37,990
我只是做最坏的打算
I'm just guarding against the worst.

487
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:40,480
早晚  要是找不到她
Sooner or later, if she's not found,

488
00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:43,060
大家又会算来算去
People will start doing math.

489
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:47,820
我只想避开那些过多的争锋相对
I want to hold off the needs-of-the-many-

490
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:49,960
还有一些争吵
versus-the-needs-of-the-few arguments

491
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,110
越远越好
as long as I can.

492
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,380
明哲保身嘛
That is one tricky hose, huh?

493
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:58,510
正是
Very.

494
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,920
不对劲  没有尖塔也没有钟
That can't be it. Got no steeple, no bells.

495
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:13,200
瑞克
Rick.

496
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:38,340
索菲亚
Sophia!

497
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:43,780
耶稣  你在聆ste听祷告吗
Yo, J.C., you taking requests?

498
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,610
我告诉你  不是这座教堂
I'm telling you, it's the wrong church.

499
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:46,900
它没有尖塔  瑞克
It's got no steeple, Rick.

500
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:47,930
这儿没有尖塔
There's no steeple.

501
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:06,220
是个电子钟  定时的
A timer. It's on a timer.

502
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:11,390
我要进去待会儿
I'm gonna go back in for a bit.

503
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:38,600
你真的要离开吗
Are you really leaving?

504
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:41,790
你不觉得这对大家都好吗
Don't you think it's best for all of us?

505
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:44,790
没错  什么使你做的决定
I think it is. What made you decide?

506
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,130
我打退堂鼓了  只想在这里做个好人  洛莉
Gotta back away. Just trying to be the good guy here, Lori,

507
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:51,150
即使你无法理解  这不是刻意的
Even if you don't see it. None of this was intended.

508
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:53,280
我希望你能明白
I hope you know that.

509
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,770
无关紧要了  我都已经说了
Well, don't matter. As long as I said it.

510
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:00,800
你就这么凭空消失  你连瑞克都不告诉一声
You're just gonna disappear? You're not even gonna tell Rick?

511
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,820
他只会试着阻止我  这正合你意
He'd only try to stop me. That's on you.

512
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,270
你告诉他你想怎么样  要么啥也别说
You tell him what you want. Or tell him nothing at all.

513
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:06,550
你是他老婆
You're his wife.

514
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:08,940
那卡尔呢  我们把他牵扯进来了
And Carl? We dragged him into this.

515
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:10,560
-我爱卡尔  -他觉得你讨厌他
- I love Carl. - He thinks you hate him.

516
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,490
我是在试着保持点距离
I'm trying to put some distance.

517
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:12,610
我想让事情变得容易点
I'm trying to make this easier.

518
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:14,840
可这样对我们谁都不容易  尤其是我
This ain't easy on any of us, least of all me.

519
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:16,470
我才是失去你的那个人
I'm the one who loses you.

520
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,080
神父  原谅我
Father, forgive me.

521
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,800
我不配得到您的怜悯
I don't deserve your mercy.

522
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:58,360
我曾祈祷安全离开亚特兰大而您应允了
I prayed for safe passage from Atlanta and you provided.

523
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,890
我曾祈祷爱德会因为打我
I prayed for Ed to be punished

524
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:03,640
因为用他内心深处萌生的邪恶想法
for laying his hands on me

525
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,920
看他的亲生女儿
and for looking at his own daughter

526
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:10,040
而受到惩罚
with whatever sickness was growing in his soul.

527
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:13,710
我祈祷您能阻止那一切
I prayed you'd put a stop to it,

528
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:17,600
让我有机会好好地抚养她
give me a chance to raise her right,

529
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,560
帮助她不要重蹈我的覆辙
help her not make my mistakes.

530
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:21,940
她害怕极了
She's so fearful.

531
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,060
她还太小了
She's so young in her way.

532
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,050
她还有很多路要走
She hasn't had a chance.

533
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:38,380
祈祷爱德死是我罪恶深重
Praying for Ed's death was a sin.

534
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:44,530
求求你  不要让我受到如此的惩罚
Please, don't let this be my punishment.

535
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,720
护她平安
Let her be safe,

536
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,630
平安的活着
alive and safe.

537
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:55,640
拜托了  上帝
Please, lord.

538
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,680
我任由你惩治
Punish me however you want,

539
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:03,390
但是请保佑她
but show mercy on her.

540
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:21,810
我要和你一起走
I'm coming with you.

541
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,770
我不知道你到底在说什么
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

542
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:25,780
我不是傻子  我也没聋
I'm not stupid and I'm certainly not deaf.

543
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:28,670
-我不知道有什么故事  -没有故事
- Look, I don't know the story. - There is no story.

544
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:29,520
那好  我不管
Fine, I don't care.

545
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:31,010
别拿忽悠别人那招来应付我
Don't confuse me with someone who does.

546
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:32,970
我现在只关心如何离开这里
Look, all I care about is getting out of here

547
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,680
走得越远越好  和你一样
As far away as I can, like you.

548
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:37,730
然后我们一起在夕阳下远航吗
We're gonna sail off into the sunset together?

549
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:39,060
手牵着手吗
We gonna hold hands?

550
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:41,060
我不是想和你在一起  沙恩
I'm not asking you to go steady, Shane.

551
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:42,130
我想让你把我带走
I'm asking for a ride,

552
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:45,120
一个另寻他处重新开始的机会
A chance to start over somewhere else.

553
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:47,670
你最近观察过这个队伍吗
You observe this group lately?

554
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:50,880
我有  我发现两个人不属于这
I have. I see two people who don't belong.

555
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:52,730
就是我们
We're the odd men out.

556
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:55,710
我们把彼此隔的太远
Between the two of us, we make a great third wheel.

557
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:58,960
即使这样又如何  逃走吗
So what? Say we do, we just run off.

558
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,850
我又凭什么要帮你这个累赘呢
What's in it for me except for the extra ass I got to cover?

559
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,180
有机会为别人做点事
The chance to do something for someone else.

560
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,790
-好的  -换位思考一下
- Yeah. - And a door that swings both ways.

561
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:09,770
给我把枪  我也会保护你
Put a gun in my hand, I'll cover your ass too.

562
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:14,280
好好想想吧
Think it over.

563
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:23,920
我们得走了  伙计
Got to move here, man.

564
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:26,830
这帮人累坏了
These people are spent.

565
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,950
还有几个小时就要天黑了
There's only so many hours of daylight left.

566
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:32,540
-回去的路还很长  -我不能停下
- We still got a long way back. - I can't stop yet.

567
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,790
我们还有很多地方没找
We still got a lot of ground to cover,

568
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:36,110
包括整条小溪的对岸
whole other side of the creek bed.

569
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:37,290
我们可以在回去的路上找
So we search that on the way back.

570
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:38,910
她也许会听到钟声
She would have heard those church bells.

571
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:39,670
也许就在附近
She could be nearby.

572
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:42,420
-可能的事情太多了  -我不能回去
- She could be a lot of things. - I can't go back.

573
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:45,480
她被落到这里是我的错
Her being out here is my fault.

574
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:46,940
这下好了
That's great.

575
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:49,130
他们让你怀疑自己了
Now they got you doubting yourself, huh?

576
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,520
你呢  你怀疑我吗
What about you? You doubt me?

577
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,720
我们每个人都犯过错
Hey, we can assign all kinds of blame.

578
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,910
找到她对我们意义重大
This means something, finding her.

579
00:53:56,910 --> 00:53:57,840
天呐
Oh man.

580
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,450
我们需要奇迹发生  决不能放弃
It would be the miracle we need. We can't give up.

581
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:12,360
你们顺着河边往回找
Y'all gonna follow the creek bed back,

582
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:13,850
达里尔  你带队
Okay? Daryl, you're in charge.

583
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:15,560
我和瑞克负责断后
Me and Rick, we're just gonna hang back,

584
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,050
进行一个小时左右的搜索
Search this area another hour or so just to be thorough.

585
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:20,960
这样我们就分开了  确定吗
You're splitting us up. You sure?

586
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:22,880
确定  我们会赶上的
Yeah, we'll catch up to you.

587
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:24,810
我也想留下
I want to stay too.

588
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:27,670
我是她的朋友
I'm her friend.

589
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:37,580
-多加小心  -好的
- Just be careful, okay? - I will.

590
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:40,350
你什么时候长大了
When did you start growing up?

591
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:48,250
我很快就来
I'll be along soon enough.

592
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:54,760
拿着它
Here, take this.

593
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:56,020
还记得怎么用吗
Remember how to use it?

594
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:58,080
我不会拿走你的枪  让你赤手空拳的
I'm not taking your gun and leaving you unarmed.

595
00:54:58,430 --> 00:55:01,810
我还有一把  拿着吧
Here, got a spare. Take it.

596
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,030
-等我一会儿  -好的
- Give me a minute? - Yeah.

597
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:21,650
拜托
Come on.

598
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:36,720
我不明白你这个眼神是什么意思
I don't know if you're looking at me with what?

599
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:41,220
悲伤
Sadness?

600
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:43,330
轻蔑
Scorn?

601
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:45,700
怜悯
Pity?

602
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:48,510
还是爱?
Love?

603
00:55:52,430 --> 00:55:54,050
也许只是漠不关心
Maybe it's just indifference.

604
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:04,310
我想你已经知道我不是什么虔诚的信徒
I guess you already know I'm not much of a believer.

605
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:07,510
我只是把信念放在别的地方了
I guess I just chose to put my faith elsewhere.

606
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:11,370
大部分放在家庭
My family, mostly.

607
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:13,400
朋友
My friends.

608
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:16,380
和工作上
My job.

609
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:23,530
问题是  我们
The thing is, we--

610
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:32,410
我需要点东西帮我们前行
I could use a little something to help keep us going.

611
00:56:35,110 --> 00:56:36,060
一点
Some kind of...

612
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:38,670
肯定
Acknowledgement.

613
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:41,720
一些我做的事是正确的迹象
Some indication I'm doing the right thing.

614
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:46,230
你不知道有多难
You don't know how hard that is to know.

615
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:56,280
也许你知道
Well, maybe you do.

616
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:08,350
听着  我不需要所有的答案
Hey look, I don't need all the answers.

617
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,790
只想要一点动力  一个暗示
Just a little nudge. A sign.

618
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:15,740
什么暗示都行
Any sign will do.

619
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:28,690
-得到你想要的了?  -我想我会自己找到
- Get what you needed? - guess I'll find out.

620
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,530
这就完了?
So this is it?

621
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,430
这就是整个计划吗
This the whole plan?

622
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,290
这计划是要把队伍
I guess the plan is to whittle us down

623
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:54,780
消减的越来越小吧
Into smaller and smaller groups

624
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,860
随身携带刀和尖木棒
Carrying knives and pointy sticks.

625
00:57:58,130 --> 00:57:59,290
我看到你的枪了
I see you have a gun.

626
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:00,900
怎么  你想要这枪么
Why, you want it?

627
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:03,570
来  拿去
Here, take it.

628
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:07,880
我受够你看我的眼神了
I'm sick of the looks you're giving me.

629
00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:12,720
你们所有人的眼神
All of you.

630
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:20,300
亲爱的  我不能想像出你正经历的痛苦
Honey, I can't imagine what you're going through.

631
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:21,850
而且我愿意做任何事去平复它
And I would do anything to stop it.

632
00:58:21,850 --> 00:58:23,840
但你必须停止责怪瑞克
But you have got to stop blaming Rick.

633
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,790
每次你看他时都表露出来
It is in your face every time you look at him.

634
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:29,720
索菲亚跑走时他没有犹豫  对么
When Sophia ran he didn't hesitate, did he?

635
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:30,730
一秒都没有
Not for a second.

636
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:32,940
我不知道谁
I don't know that any of

637
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:34,810
还能像他那样追着她去
us would have gone after her the way he did

638
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:37,080
或是像他做那么艰难的决定
Or made the hard decisions that he had to make

639
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:40,140
谁能做的不同
Or that anybody could have done it any differently.

640
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:45,870
谁能
Anybody?

641
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,200
你们依靠他还责怪他的不完美
Y'all look to him and then you blame him when he's not perfect.

642
00:58:57,730 --> 00:58:59,760
如果你们认为没有他也照走  恕不挽留
If you think you can do this without him, go right ahead.

643
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,170
没人拦着你们
Nobody is stopping you.

644
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,300
我们该继续走了
We should keep moving.

645
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:30,580
沙恩
Shane.

646
01:01:47,790 --> 01:01:58,930
不  不要
Oh no. No.

647
01:01:58,930 --> 01:02:12,410
不  不  不
No no no no!
