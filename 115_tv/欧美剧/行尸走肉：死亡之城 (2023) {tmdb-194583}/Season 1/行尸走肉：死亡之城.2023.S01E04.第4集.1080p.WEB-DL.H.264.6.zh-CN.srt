我从警局的证物柜里偷了两袋海洛因
I stole two bags of heroin from the evidence closet at work

121
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,870
把它们栽赃到了凯莉的车上
and I planted them in Carrie's car.

122
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,820
我希望她能在路上被拦下
I was hoping that she'd get pulled over

123
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,100
然后因为持有毒品而被捕
and arrested for possession.

124
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,280
结果适得其反了
But it backfired, and, um...

125
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:31,450
头儿知道是我干的  所以我被停职了
Chief, uh, knows it was me, and I've been suspended.

126
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,830
我的天  梅丽安
My God, Marianne.

127
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,830
我不知道该说什么了
I-- I-- I don't know what the hell to say.

128
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,130
等等  我想起来了  太蠢了
Oh, wait. It just came to me. That was stupid!

129
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,630
你他妈脑残吗
Goddamn idiotic!

130
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,170
你是欠抽了吧  居然干出那种事
You're a complete smacked-ass for doing that.

131
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,850
谢了  妈
Thanks, Mom.

132
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,140
凯莉知道是你干的吗
Does Carrie know it was you?

133
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,480
-不  她没法证明  -谢天谢地
- She can't prove it, no. - Well, thank God.

134
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,690
她要是知道  我们就得永远失去德鲁了
Otherwise, we'd lose Drew forever.

135
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,110
你有什么想法吗
Any thoughts?

136
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,090
我觉得外婆总结得很到位了
I think Gran summed it up nicely.

137
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,960
不过如果是要分享生活的话  我今天跟贝卡分手了
But if we're sharing, I split up with Becca today.

138
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,130
你...你有别人了吗
You-- Did you meet somebody else?

139
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,800
没有  就是顺其自然分手了
No. No, it just ran its course.

140
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,800
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

141
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,270
你有什么想分享的事吗  妈
Do you have anything you'd like to share, Mom?

142
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:42,560
你似乎还想说点什么
You seem like you wanna say something else.

143
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,200
没有  只是不知道我他妈要怎么办
No. Just wondering what the hell I'm gonna do,

144
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,860
天天跟你困在一起
stuck in the house with you all day.

145
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,180
格兰姆医生吗
Dr. Graham?

146
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,330
-我是梅尔・希安  -你好
- Mare Sheehan. - Hi.

147
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,730
你肯定见过不少警察吧
So, I bet you see a lot of cops, huh?

148
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,390
对  这些年来确实见过几个
Oh, I've seen a few over the years, yes.

149
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:14,770
都是硬骨头吧  就好像...他们不想来
Hard cases, right? Like, they don't wanna be here.

150
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,220
他们不觉得自己需要帮助
They don't think they need the help.

151
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:19,860
-有些是的  不过大部分...  -我只想说
- Oh, some, but most are-- - You know, I just wanna say

152
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,270
在这点上你不用担心我
you don't have to worry about that with me.

153
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,310
我会准时来报道  不缺席
I'll be here on time, every time.

154
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,060
-太好了  -很好
- Wonderful. - Awesome.

155
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,320
其实你来得早了一点
You're actually a little bit early.

156
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,990
这事到底怎么进行
So, how does this work, exactly?

157
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:31,360
比如  我过来  我们聊开
Like, you know, I come in, we talk it out,

158
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,040
你向局里提交报告说我很合作
you submit a report to the department saying I cooperated,

159
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,860
我们坚持一段时间  然后就能完事了
and we do that for a while and we're good to go?

160
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,450
-基本是的  -好
- Basically, yes. - Okay.

161
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,330
只是...
It's just, um...

162
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,160
在我们开始之前...
you know, before we get into all this...

163
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,670
我希望你别有挫败感  仅此而已
I don't want you to get discouraged. That's all.

164
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,290
挫败感
Discouraged?

165
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,800
就是  如果没有什么重大突破之类的
Like, you know, if there's not, like, a big breakthrough

166
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,970
你懂吗  那不是你的错
or something, you know? It's not you.

167
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,560
我以前也做过这些  心理治疗
I've done this before. Therapy.

168
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,720
我和我丈夫  我们做过婚姻咨询
Me and my husband, we saw this marriage counselor.

169
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,640
那是什么感觉
What was that experience like?

170
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,180
我们最后离婚了
We're divorced.

171
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,770
好吧  这就是我想说的  好吗
Right. So, like, that's what I mean. You know?

172
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,450
我了解这种事
I mean, I understand this kind of thing

173
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,070
对某些人可能会有帮助
can be helpful for some people.

174
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,200
我以前跟一个警察共事过  叫斯威尼  是个混蛋
This cop I used to work with, Sweeney, fucking prick,

175
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,410
他以前...
he, uh, used to, you know,

176
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,290
就是...有一天晚上他出去巡逻
like he-- he-- he was out on patrol one night

177
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,790
开车撞到了一个老太太
and, um, ran his car into an old lady

178
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,410
她死了  你懂吗  把他折腾得不轻
and killed her, you know? Really messed him up.

179
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,050
于是他开始见心理医生
So he started seeing a therapist.

180
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:30,210
两个月后  他辞职了  买了条狗
Two months later, he, uh, quits his job, buys a dog,

181
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,750
开始...随时都会拥抱他老婆
starts, like, hugging his wife all the time.

182
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,640
现在他在福吉谷当公园导游
And now he's a park guide over at Valley Forge.

183
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,380
幸福得不得了  万岁
Happy as a clam. Bingo.

184
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:43,010
只是  对我来说  我...
It's just, for me, I, you know...

185
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,310
-还没起过作用  -对
- Hasn't worked yet? - Right.

186
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,060
对  你懂的
Right. You know.

187
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,280
总之  我只是想先说清楚
Anyway, so I just wanna throw that out there.

188
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,360
以免你失望
So you're not, like,

189
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:01,870
如果没有那种"阿弥陀佛"式的开悟的话
disappointed if there's not a big "Hallelujah" Moment.

190
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,200
明白  我们试试看吧
Understood. Why don't we try?

191
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,670
让治愈开始吧
Let the healing begin.

192
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,810
马克执事  我是扎博尔警探
Deacon Mark, Detective Zabel.

193
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,560
-你好  -你好
- Yes. Hello. - Hi.

194
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,360
过去这几天我一直在联系你
Been trying to get a hold of you for the past few days.

195
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,030
你收到我的语音留言了吗
Did you get my voicemails?

196
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,120
有  收到了  抱歉
Yes. Yes, I did. Sorry. Sorry.

197
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,490
教堂那边有点忙
Things have been busy over at the church.

198
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,280
我都要以为你是在故意躲我了
I was beginning to think you were avoiding me.

199
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,070
你有吗
Were you?

200
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,330
我能怎么帮你  警探
What can I help you with, Detective?

201
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,790
我只是想问问你是在
Well, uh, I just wanted to ask you some questions

202
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,220
什么情况之下调来
about the circumstances

203
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,090
圣迈克尔教堂的
of your transfer here to St. Michael's.

204
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,390
恐怕我帮不上什么忙
Well, I'm afraid I won't be much help.

205
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,930
所有奥古斯丁教团教士的调动安排
All Augustinian reassignments

206
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:02,230
都是由教区办公室定的  所以...
are dealt with the provincial's office, so--

207
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:05,060
具体点说吧  我想问问你之前的教区中
Well, more specifically about the sexual misconduct complaint

208
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,810
一位14岁女孩的父母投诉
filed against you at your previous parish

209
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,770
你有不正当性行为的情况
by, uh, the parents of a 14-year-old girl.

210
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,730
大主教管区叫我
Uh, I've been instructed by the archdiocese

211
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,440
不要谈论那次事件
not to speak about that case.

212
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,950
执事  我...  我从小在天主教家庭中长大
Look, Deac, I-- I-- I was raised Catholic.

213
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,570
我在努力站在你这一边
I'm trying to be on your side here.

214
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,860
但你可以理解我为什么对这件事很关注  对吧
But you can understand why I'd be concerned, right?

215
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,330
我发现艾琳・麦克梅纳明
I find out that the last person

216
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,290
遇害当晚和她最后讲过话的人
to speak with Erin McMenamin on the night she's murdered

217
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:26,080
可能曾与另一位少女
potentially had an inappropriate relationship

218
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,960
有不正当关系
with another young girl.

219
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,460
大主教管区调查过那件事了  警探
The archdiocese investigated the incident, detective,

220
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,470
并确信并未发生什么事  什么都没发生
and believe nothing happened. Nothing.

221
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,880
那我该相信什么呢
And what should I believe?

222
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,340
你最好把你的事说清楚  马克
You better start getting your story straight, Mark.

223
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,390
因为如果有人告诉了我你的历史
'Cause if I got the tip about your past,

224
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,300
要不了多久  大家都会知道的
it won't be long till everyone finds out.

225
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,310
谢谢
Thank you.

226
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,910
我是说...  我的意思是  我花了好久
Well, I mean-- I mean, it took me a long time

227
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,200
才明白这点  但现实就是
to realize this, but the reality is,

228
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,490
我可能不是大作家的料
I, you know, maybe I'm just not a great writer.

229
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,950
我...  只能写出一本书  但是呢
I-- I only had one book in me, you know. But you know what?

230
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,620
我可以坦然接受
I'm okay with that.

231
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,830
至少你还成功过一次
Well, at least you had your one shot.

232
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,710
大多数人连那个成就都没有
Most people never even get that.

233
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,960
你也有过啊  鹰夫人
You got yours, Lady Hawk.

234
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:25,260
-你喜欢做老师吗  -我...  我开始喜欢了
- You like being a teacher? - Um, well, I've-- I've grown to.

235
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,940
我之前一向把教书看作
Um, I always used to look at teaching

236
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,060
看作是
as the-- the thing that you did

237
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,180
如果你做不来你想做的  就可以去做的那种事
if you couldn't do the thing you wanted to do.

238
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,780
所以这是一种善意的提醒
So it's kind of a nice reminder

239
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,730
提醒我  我的人生在稳步倒退
that my life is steadily declining.

240
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,110
我真幸运  在你走下坡路时遇到了你
Lucky me. Catch you on the down slide, huh?

241
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,650
你和德鲁的妈妈谈过了吗
Hey, did you talk to Drew's mother?

242
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:49,160
-嗯  谈过了  -结果呢  结果怎么样
- Uh, yeah. Yeah, I did. - And? How did that go?

243
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:53,330
结果...  就是车祸现场
It was a... it was a car crash.

244
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,870
我去  我很遗憾  为什么  出了什么事
Oh, shit. I'm sorry. Why? What happened?

245
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:00,790
我...  我把事情搞砸了  她...
I just, um, I fucked it up, uh, and she's...

246
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,670
听着  她...
Oh, look, she's...

247
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:08,770
那弗兰克呢
What about Frank?

248
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:11,060
他...  他和她讲过话吗
Does he, you know, does he ever talk to her?

249
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,890
没有  他是唱红脸的
Uh, no, he's the good cop.

250
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,850
你给自己放过假吗
You ever give yourself a break?

251
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:25,650
我意思是  你有给过自己时间吗
I mean, do you ever just get to take time for yourself?

252
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,710
你是要告诉我  我看着精疲力尽吗
Are you about to tell me I look exhausted?

253
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,120
不  不
No. No.

254
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,540
但看起来你好像背负着很多沉重的东西
But it seems like you're carrying a lot of heavy stuff,

255
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,590
我很好奇是否有人
and I, you know, I wonder if anybody

256
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,210
会为你做点什么
ever does anything for you.

257
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,210
听着...
Listen...

258
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,760
周六是我生日  我并非想要个礼物
Saturday is my birthday. Not that I expect a gift,

259
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,180
但要不让我带你出去吧
but why don't you let me take you out?

260
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:51,930
我们要去哪儿
Where are we goin'?

261
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,940
我还不确定  但我会想出主意的
I don't know, but I will figure it out,

262
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,610
7点钟我去接你时
and I will surprise you when I pick you up

263
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,440
会给你惊喜
at seven o'clock.

264
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,260
有天晚上有人给我打了电话
So, someone called me the other night,

265
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,630
跟我说凯蒂还活着
telling me that Katie was alive

266
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,100
并且知道她人在哪里
and that they knew where she was.

267
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,960
天啊  他们怎么说的
Oh, my God. Well, what did they say?

268
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,520
如果我想知道她在哪里的话
If I wanted to find out where,

269
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,260
我就得付给他五千块
I'd have to give 'em five thousand dollars.

270
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:33,730
这是骗人的  这事我听着不太对
Okay. Well, that's a scam. That is-- I don't like that.

271
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:34,930
你得去告诉梅尔
You need to tell Mare about that.

272
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,730
你说得对  我确实应该
Yeah, you're right. I should.

273
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,410
不过梅尔现在不上班了
Mare's not working anymore, though.

274
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,110
什么
What?

275
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,940

你的事还不够多吗
With everything you've got going on? No.

292
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:47,840

如果他在我身边的话
and I feel like if he's here with me,

299
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,570
我就知道他没有飘荡在外
then I know that he's not just out there.

300
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,130
没事  我很好  抱歉
It's okay. I'm fine. I'm sorry.

392
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,120
我只是想让你走之前

我们好几个月没碰面了
We hadn't seen each other in a few months.

397
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,180
她和我说她读了那篇关于你的文章
She was telling me that she read the article about you.

398
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,230

她的长女现在住在东城

然后我告诉她说你刚被派遣
And I told her that you had just been sent in

401
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,290
去协助一个案子  在克里顿小溪
to help out on the case of that poor girl

402
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:00,180
发现的一个可怜女孩尸体

她女儿觉得这事挺好的

而且所有人对警局处理案件的方式
And everyone's up in arms

407
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:13,890
都非常不满
over how the police are handling that case.

408
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:18,270
我觉得他们不了解那个案件多复杂
I don't think they understand how hard of a case that was.

409
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,080
梅尔是个好警探
Mare's a good detective.

410
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,890
他们刚解雇的是梅尔吗
Is Mare the one they just let go?

411
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:30,820
听起来似乎她力不从心
Well, it sounds like she was maybe in over her head.

412
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,030
他们很幸运能有你帮助
They're lucky they have you.

413
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,230
保佑我们吧  我们的上帝...
Bless us, O Lord...

414
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:43,650
感谢我们即将从基督我主那里...
And these thy gifts which we're about to receive...

415
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:48,340
得来的慷慨的赐予
from thy bounty through Christ our Lord.

416
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,750
阿门
Amen.

417
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,150
-你在这做什么呢  -看见那些新闻了
- What are you doing here? - Saw the news.

418
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:11,200
好吧  进来吧  请进  请进
Right. Uh, come in, come in, come in.

419
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:16,140

Mom, this is my Mare-- my partner, Mare,

421
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,220
你好
Hello.

422
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,890
嗨  梅尔  我们刚还谈到你了
Hi, Mare. We were just talking about you.

423
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,880
你饿吗  我们做了好多吃的
Are you hungry? We made plenty.

424
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:30,520
不  我...我不饿  谢谢你
No, I'm-- I'm good, thank you.

425
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,080
-来瓶啤酒吗  -可以
- Want a beer? - Sure.

426
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,930
好的  谢谢了
Great. Thank you.

427
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,320
好吧  米西・赛格
Okay. Missy Sager,

428
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,700
以太阳谷高中全班第一名的成绩毕业

430
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,090
她被库兹敦大学的护理专业录取
She enrolled in the nursing program at Kutztown University.

431
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:50,400
大一那年  她过马路时
Freshman year, she's crossing the street,

432
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,310
一个老妇人闯红灯撞了她  导致髋部骨折
an old lady runs a stop sign and hits her. Fractures her hip.

433
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:57,350
之后  她奥施康定上瘾  接着吗啡
Soon after, she starts on Oxy, then morphine.

434
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:59,000
剩下的故事你都知道了
You know the rest of the story.

435
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:02,000
她的手机在周五凌晨两点23分关机
Her phone was shut off at 2:23 a.M. Friday.

436
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:04,160
社交媒体账号也毫无消息
Social media accounts all went dark as well.

437
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,100
自此她父母  姐姐  朋友都没她消息了
No contact with her mom, dad, sister, friends since.

438
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:12,490
豪瑟不觉得这些案件是相关的
Hauser doesn't think these cases are related.

439
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,220
米西・赛格和凯蒂・贝里的案件可能有联系
Missy Sager and Katie Bailey maybe,

440
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,150
但艾琳不是
but not Erin.

441
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,950
豪瑟是来替我的吗
Hauser my replacement?

442
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:22,300
在警校的时候他是我们的教官
He was our PT instructor at the academy.

443
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,150
我们六个人在他的后车厢里
As a graduation gift,

444
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:25,400
拉了泡屎作为毕业礼物
all six of us took a shit in his trunk.

445
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:34,120
那你怎么想的
So, come on. What do you think?

446
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,700
我觉得她们的生活习惯都太不相同了
I think their lifestyles are too different.

447
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,450
凯蒂和米西是瘾君子
Katie and Missy were drug abusers

448
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,450
为了吸毒她们都以卖淫为生
who had turned to prostitution to support their habit.

449
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:44,570
两人也都有侧门账号
Both had active Sidedoor accounts.

450
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,250
目前没有证据证明
There's no evidence to suggest

451
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,280
艾琳也是妓女
that Erin was involved in prostitution.

452
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:52,940
没有证据  但是她有可能是
No evidence. But she could have been.

453
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:55,080
她手机或电脑什么都没发现
Nothing turned up on her phone or computer.

454
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,900
没有帖子  照片  或者邮件
No postings, pictures, or e-mails.

455
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:00,860
我们知道她儿子耳朵的手术需要钱
We know she needed the money for her son's ear surgery.

456
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:04,120
耳鼻喉科室告诉我她预订了手术
ENT office told me she scheduled it,

457
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,430
又取消了两次
cancelled, twice.

458
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,430
如果你是一个少女
If you're a teenage girl,

459
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,730
家里有孩子  爸爸又是肯尼那样的人
baby at home and a dad like Kenny,

460
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:13,550
你不会用这样的照片在你电脑上
you're not gonna open an account on Sidedoor

461
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:16,480
注册一个侧门账号
with pictures like this on your own computer.

462
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:21,020
相信我  青春期少女相当狡猾
Trust me, teenage girls are fucking sneaky.

463
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,850
你想跟我说下你被停职的真正原因吗
Wanna tell me the real reason they put you on leave?

464
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:39,020
以后吧   如果你不介意的话
One day. Right now, I just wanna drink these beers

465
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,370
现在我只想喝点啤酒  聊聊怎么找寻这些少女
and talk about finding these girls, if that's okay.

466
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,600
所以我们想知道的是
So, what we're trying to figure out

467
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,680
为什么艾琳会跟迪伦撒谎说他是孩子爸爸
is why Erin would lie to Dylan about him being the father?

468
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:55,480
为什么不直接告诉他真相
Why not just tell him the truth?

469
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,970
因为她一直说他的父母对她很好
Because she always said how nice his parents were to her.

470
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,100
他们人有多好
How they were good people.

471
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,480
她希望DJ生活中能一直
She liked the idea of DJ always having

472
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,360
拥有这种爱  明白吗
that kind of love in his life, you know?

473
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:12,870
她有说过需要钱给DJ做耳朵手术吗
Did she talk about needing money for ear surgery for DJ?

474
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:16,400
只说过她想让迪伦付这个钱
Just that she wanted Dylan to pay for it.

475
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,070
但他一直跟她说他没钱
But he kept telling her he didn't have the money.

476
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:21,670
那她说过如果迪伦付不起的话
Did she say how she would get it

477
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,590
她要怎么筹钱吗
if Dylan couldn't pay for it?

478
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,480
杰茜
Jess.

479
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,850
我明白你想保护你的朋友  好吗
I understand you wanna protect your friend, all right?

480
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:40,780
这非常令人佩服
That's admirable.

481
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,700
但艾琳已经不在了  亲爱的
But Erin's gone, sweetie.

482
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,400
所以你继续保持沉默  唯一得益的
So the only person you're helping by keeping silent

483
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,730
是那个杀了她的人
is the person who killed her.

484
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:51,630
这个人可能还杀了其他两个女生
Same person who might've killed two more girls.

485
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,230
杰茜
Jess.

486
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,490
她和你说过她打算
Did she tell you how she was planning

487
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:03,840
怎么搞到耳朵手术的钱吗
on getting the money for that ear surgery?

488
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:17,640
侧门陪伴服务
贾思敏

489
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:15,530
她叫我帮她创建一个账号
She asked me to create an account for her.

490
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,610
她不想在家里创建
She didn't wanna make one at home

491
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:20,100
因为她不想她爸爸发现
'cause she didn't want her dad to find out.

492
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:26,490
那些照片是你拍的吗  亲爱的
Did you take those pictures, sweetie?

493
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:30,920
没事
It's okay.

494
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:40,200
可是  她只打算做一段时间的
But... she was only gonna do it for a little while

495
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,310
直到她存够手术钱
until she saved up enough money for the surgery.

496
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:45,120
做什么  跟男人做爱吗
Do what? Have sex with men?

497
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,920
是的  但她从没有过
Well, yeah. But she never did.

498
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,830
没有  她跟我说
No, she told me that

499
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:55,390
她实在做不到
she couldn't bring herself to do it, you know.

500
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,480
杰茜
Jess.

501
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,640
这很重要
It's really important.

502
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:03,440
你确定她一次都没有出去
Are you sure she never once went out

503
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,440
跟那些给她发信息的男人

- who messaged her? - No, I'm sure.

505
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:15,910
好的  好的
Okay. All right.

506
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,610
你有账号密码吗
Do you have the login and password?

507
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,860
-该死  -怎么了
- Shit. - What's the matter?

508
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:38,830
我忘拿手机了  等我一下
I left my phone. Give me a sec.

509
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,140
那个  有件事我忘了问
Hey, just, uh-- I had something I forgot to ask.

510

好的  杰茜
Sure. Jess?

511
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,640
杰茜  你知道她日记放哪里吗
Jess, do you know where she kept her journals?

512
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,860
她房间角落里有个化妆台
Uh, there's a dresser in-- in the corner of her room.

513
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,560
她把日记放在最下面两个抽屉之间
And she keeps them in between the two bottom drawers.

514
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,590
好的  谢谢  谢谢
Okay. Thanks. Thanks.

553
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:47,400
你们俩以前很亲近
So, you two were pretty close?

554
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:52,530
有时候  我感觉他是我最好的朋友
Mm. Sometimes, I felt like he was my best friend,

555
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:55,980
而有时  我又感觉我完全不认识他
and other times, I felt like I didn't know him at all.

556
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:59,810
你有想好你想说什么了吗
Mm. Have you figured out what you wanna say yet?

557
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:09,480
我觉得我是想试图明白他为什么那么做
I think it's my attempt to try and understand why he did it.

558
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,850
进展不是很顺利
It's not going very well.

559

我们没有  我们分崩离析了
We didn't. We fell apart.

561
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,670
所以你才想在这上大学吗
Is that why you wanna stick around here for college?

562
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,050
你害怕如果你离开
You're afraid if you leave,

563
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,840
你们又会散架
everything will fall apart again?

564
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:36,320
