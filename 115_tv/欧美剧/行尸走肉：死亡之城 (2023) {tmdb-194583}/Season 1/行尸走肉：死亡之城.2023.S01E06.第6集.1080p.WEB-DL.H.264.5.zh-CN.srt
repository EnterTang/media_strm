00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,140
You're afraid.

00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,570
Or you justcan't do it.

6
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,830

25
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,500
The new guy learned stuffthis week.

But he sucks,so don't expect too much.

27
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,440
I'm glad reverend purdybrought
back the faith heritagewinterfest.

28
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,730

the sleigh ridesand the snow fights.

29
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,970
Hot chocolateand pie-eating contests.

30
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,550
Now it's justanother opportunity
for stillsonto make a speech,man.

31
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,170
Well,I don't careabout the speech.

32
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,280
I'm all aboutthe pie eating.

33
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,710
Yeah,me too.

34
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,740
Johnny,you hear the namewe
made up for the baby?

35
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,250
Don't even know if it's
a boy or a girl yet.

36
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,390
Gretzky bannerman.

37
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,200
The great one.

38
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,060
Gretzky bannerman?

39
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:14,800
-I like that.
--I was kidding.

40
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,440
That's good,though. I like that.

41
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,610
Bannerman.

42
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,510

-Yeah.
-Thank you.

45
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,470
One second,sarah. Be right back.

46
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,400
Hey...is everything okay?

47
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,750
Yeah,sure.

48
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,300
You're not mad that I
didn'ttell you about the baby?

49
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,690
I mean,I could.

50
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,910
We don't have to tell walt.

51
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,240
I'm not so sure walt careseither way.

52
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,880
Come on,of course he does.

53
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,120
Yeah,I know.

54
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,540
It's just he's beenso busy lately.

55
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,250
Well,work,a new house,right?

56
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,930
No,it's not the houseor work.

57
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,560
It's something else.

58
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,880
I saw him emailingon the computer the other
night and when I came in,he turned it off.

59
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,360
I don't know,think he has a girlfriend?

60
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,310
Oh,sheriff walt?

61
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,670
A girlfriend?

62
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,080
Come on.

63
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,460
Why don't you just
ask himwhat he's doing?

64
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,910
You thinkI haven't tried?

65
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:11,840
all right,let's get going.

66
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,350
Time to set upsome bingo.

67
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,520
And,hey,on theirst encore,I want
to hear layla,got it--remember?

68
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,620

69
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,320
Oh,man!

70
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,540
And I don't thinkyou guys are getting
any preferentialbingo treatment.

71
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,770
This is gonna be a clean game here.

72
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,270
And you,john,no visionsabout
what number's next,huh?

73
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,650
sometimes fate deals us a strange hand.

74
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,810
On the day of the
faith heritage festival

75
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:18,330
,a day when normally we
would celebrate community,

76
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:25,410
the people of cleaves mills lost one of
its most beloved citizens-- walt bannerman.

77
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,490
Walt.

78
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:31,010
Hey,come on,bingo waits for no man.

79
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:35,330
I,H... I just had a vision...

80
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,600

81
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,550
Come on.

82
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,180
What,are you serious?

83
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,860
Today.

84
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,690

Every day's dangerous.

92

94
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:12,750
In the vision,purdy says that it

00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,270
How dangerouscan that be?

97
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,830
Well,we needto take this seriously.

98
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,970
John,after allwe've been
through,I do take this seriously.

99
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,930
I can also take careof myself,you know?

100
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,520
All right,but todayyou have no choice.

00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,550
All right,well,do me a favor.

103
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,570
Don't tell sarah.

104
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,440

00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,100
Nope.

Subject matter:Global warming.

164
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,380
And you will beprepared.

165
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,830
You underestimate me,malcolm.

166
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:12,000
No,sir,that's one thingI never do.

167
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,620
I've made some changesto your speech.

168
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,740
Please look them over.

169
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,800
The vice president has reconsidered.

170
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,990
He won't be havingthe hotdog after all.

171
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,980
bobby,I'll take one with extra relish.

00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,600
I'll give you botha fish,how's that?

175
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:38,360
What's the deal with youkeeping
eagle eyes on walt all day?

176
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,380
Who says I'm doing that?

177
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,480
Well,zero reactionwhen I
mentioned my job offer earlier.

178
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,720
Job offer?

179
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:46,520
You got a job offer?

180
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,130
My point exactly.

181
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,130
It's a great gig.

182
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,140
Sports trainer for all
kindof professional athletes.

183
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,110
Sweet paycheck.

184
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,890
Congratulations.

185
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,030
It sounds perfect,man.

186
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,750
Almost--it's
out of state.

187
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,620
Listen,if it'sa good opportunity for you---

188
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,380
come on,and let youfight stillson by yourself?

189
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,840
I'm not leaving you alonewith
armageddon out there.

190
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,590
Walt!

191
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,670
whoa,whoa,whoa,hey.

192
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,040
You wanna see what the
insideof a jail cell looks like?

193
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:19,840
Keep that up.

194
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,820
It's a really good way to find out.

195
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,270
Come on,let's go.

196
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,310
{\a6}Faith Heritage
University

197
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:30,250
we didn't support faith heritage,
give you money,a satellite,

198
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:35,990
a bigger audience than ever for you to throwa
carnival for cleaves millscountry bumpkins.

199
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,500
You should be concentratingon stillson.

200
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:42,300
Fundraising for hisfuture
run for the presidency.

201
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:47,900
That's our objective,not sipping
hot cider,or making s'mores.

202
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:55,330
I have been thinking lessabout stillson,
admittedly,and more about faith heritage.

203
00:08:55,390 --> 00:09:01,650
I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the
directionwe're headed in these days.

204
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,250
Who are you to makethat decision?

205
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,250
The founder of faith heritage.

206
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,540
You have a short memory,gene.

207
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,750
Remember?

208
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,760
I put you backon your feet.

209
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:15,430
I've decidedto take faith heritage
back to where it used to be.

210
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:18,230
A churchfor the community.

211
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,630
Not a global interestthat
serves politicians.

212
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,210
Did johnny smithput you up to this?

213
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,890
Johnny has nothingto do with this.

214
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:31,790
Your agenda isat cross
purposes with god's work.

215
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,040
You don't understandanything,gene.

216
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:48,010

Oh,we have a
winner--come on up here.

222
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,300
Hey,buddy,can I get a hotdog?

223
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,670
Thanks.

224
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,460
Give me the money!

225
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,990
Hurry up!

226
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,240
Give me the money.

227
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,990
Stop!

228
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,640
Stop that man!

229
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,810
I've been robbed!

230
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,820
Walt,come back!

231
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,580
stop!

232
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,390
Stop that man! I've been robbed!

233
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,540
stop that man! I've been robbed!

234
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,570
Heads up! Watch out!

235
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,120
Don't move or you'll
feela whole lot worse.

236
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,470
I think I owe you one,john.

237
00:11:55,390 --> 00:12:00,490
"We fix our eyes not on
what is seen..."

238
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,500
well? It's not over.

239
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,430
So what's going on?

240
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,570
A guy with two strikes looking
at someserious jail time.

241
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:25,530
All in a day's work.

242
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,140
But what about the phone
callat the house this morning?

243
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,740
Walt,I'm not letting goof this.

244
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,530
All right,I am working on
somethingoutside of work.

245
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:40,060
Well,that doesn'ttell me much.

246
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,990
Look,john,we've been friendsa long time.

247
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,580
You help me with my
stuff,I help you with yours.

248
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,220
But you've gotta trust meon this one.

249
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,530
It's not dangerousand it's not
something that sarah needsto know,a'ight?

250
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,170
I'm still keeping my eye on you.

251
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,450
Fine.

252
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,340
Where are you going now?

253
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,750
I'm goingto the bathroom.

254
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,420
You wanna follow mein there too?

255
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,240
Now really.

256

261
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,690
Don't know if I can
handlea whole day of this.

262
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,380
Yeah,you and me both.

263
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,820
No.

264
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,040
Well?

265
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,380
I got nothing.

266
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,530
Which means what?

267
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,890
I didn't see anything.

268
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,210
Okay,good.

269
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,200
Now you can stopbothering me

Oh,the usual.

Wow,he's gotyour musical talent,huh?

276
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,240
He's good.

277
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,450
He's a big ham,like you.

278
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,390
Oh,stop.

279
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,300
Cut it out.

280
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,100
Bannerman.

I'll see you thereat
the park in ten minutes.

285
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:16,110
Okay,thank you very much.

286
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,230
Listen,I gotta run,okay?

287
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:19,560
I gotta see somebody,but
I'll be back really soon.

288
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,750
You're leaving?

289
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,450
I'll be back shortly,okay?

290
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,190
Walt.

291
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,820
Look,it's nothingto worry about,sarah.

292
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,780
No,I am worried.

293
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,970
The way you'vebeen acting
lately-- hiding things.

294
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:30,650
Have you noticed?

295
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,960
I'm having a baby.

296
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,080
And your son isexpecting you to
come congratulate himin a minute.

297
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,250
I wouldn't be doing
thisif it wasn't important.

298
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,160
More important than J.J.?

299
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,040
You know,the pastcouple of weeks,your
family's beencoming in second place.

300
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,920
I'll make it up to you...and J.J.

301
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,610
Really?

302
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,600
I mean,you're not
listeningto me anymore.

303
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,650
I feel like I'm speakinga
different language.

304
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,870
Je t'aime.

305
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,730
Very funny.

306
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,740
Well,it used to be when we learnedto say
"I love you" in eight differentlanguages.

307
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:02,260
I'm too mad to playthat game right now.

308
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,530
I want you to stay hereand see J.J.

309
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,180
I've been waitingfor
this lead for a long time.

310
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,260
I gotta go deal with this
nowand then I'll be back.

311
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,230
Ti amo.

312
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,340
Ti amo.

313
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,650
So,gene,what'd you thinkof
the new introduction?

314
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,760
It's not gonnabe necessary.

315
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:38,240
I'll be making the speech.

316
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,500
I wasn't made awareof this.

317
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,620
Well,I decided thatit's more
appropriate for me to deliver the speech.

318
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,490
After all,this isn'ta political rally.

319
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,540
It's the faith heritagefestival.

320
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,280
Gene-

321
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:55,700
-mr.Vice president,with all due respect,
I used to believewhat you stood for.

322
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:01,620
But now I havesome serious
concerns about the peoplebehind you.

323
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,660
Don't you?

324
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,680
Where'd walt go?

325
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,840
He didn't tell me.

326
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:33,340
You didn't see anything?

327
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,830
Visions about walt.

328
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,890
I mean,you'd tell me,right?

329
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,910
Yeah.

330
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,040
I haven't seen anything.

331
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,820
What do you think?

332
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,110
Did you like my song?

333
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:45,190
Well,I know the bass playerwas
off tune,but otherwise,was it okay?

334
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,080
You were great.

335
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:46,710
You were great.

336
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,740
The solo was awesome!

337
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,390
Where's dad?

338
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:51,680
He had some business.

339
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,390
But he'll be back as soon as he's done.

340
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,530
What's that?

341
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:56,870
Oh,it's a gift card.

342
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,070
Reverend purdy gave itto us for playing.

343
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:01,730
We get to buy mp3 songs.

344
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,210
on the day of the
faith heritage festival,

345
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:23,560
the people of cleaves mills mourn the
loss of one of our most beloved citizens.

346
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:37,820
sheriff bannerman,do you know
how longI've held on to this?

347
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,620
If this is true...

348
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,600
john
smith's in fora big surprise.

349
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:12,200

me,ask reverend purdy.

a message after the tone.

351
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:16,810

352
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,650

353
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,780
It's important.

354
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,510
Thank you.

355
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,730
Are you gonna actually tell
mewhat's going on with walt?

356
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:25,550
Listen,I had a visionthat walt died.

357
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,190
I thought I stopped it.

358
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,740
Now I thinkI put purdy in danger.

359
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:29,910
Have you seen him?

360
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,000
Not in a while.

361
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,830
But we'll find him.

362
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,600
Let's split up.

363
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,610
Let's split up.

364
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,130
Good job.

365
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,660
Here you go.

366
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:46,000
Well,congratulationson the,uh-
- bowling ball.

367
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,160
That's what my mom calls it.

368
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,440
J.J.

369
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,150
wow,you threw that just like a girl.

370
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,750
Ahem.

371
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,050
Sorry.

372
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:15,500
Girls can throw great.

373
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:16,960
Especially my mom.

374
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,770
Yeah.

375
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,030
Yeah,I'm sure she can.

376
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,110
-Oh,you were closerthat time.
-So here's the deal,J.J.

377
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,740
If I miss this thirdand final shot

378
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,880
I will give you a rideon air force two.

379
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,960
Or air force one,if
you wait a couple years.

380
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,910
How's that sound?

381
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,050
Wow!

382
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,860
Oh....

383
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,340
That's all right.

384
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:50,070
We can pretend I
missed.How's that sound?

385
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:55,450
If it's okay with your mom,you
pick a weekend,I'll take you up.

386
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:01,660

387
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,880

****

394
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:29,020
Hey,have you seenreverend purdy?

395
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,590
I left just a while ago.

396
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:31,730
What did he say wherehe was going?

397
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:34,680
We're about readyto
broadcast--he's gotta come back.

398
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,660
He left his notes.

399
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,220
Let get set up ***

400
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:55,490

401
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,870
walt,listen to me.

402
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,340
I just got a bad
vision.Purdy's gonna die.

403
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:01,130
You know the chapel at faith heritage?

404
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,230
There's a stained glassof st.Michael.

405
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:05,320
It's gonna explode.

406
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,950
I'm meeting him hereright now.

407
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,410
You're meeting him

408
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,690
-Walt.
-oh,my god.

409
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,200
Walt.

410
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,270
janus.

411
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,010
Oh,my god.

412
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,400
Come on...come on.

413
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:16,050
He's not responding.

414
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,010
He's not responding.

415
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,340
He's gone.

416
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,320
Walt,no.no..

417
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:36,880
no....

418
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,230
There's my man.

419
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,490
How you doing,buddy?

420
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,140
Okay.

421
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,340
You need some help?

422
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,060
No,I got it.

423
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:11,220
That's the tricky part right there.

424
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:15,240
The guy that came upwith
that,I wanna smack.

425
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,190
You got it now just pull the big part

426
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,080
over the top.

427
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,920
Down--drop it
through there.

428
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,530
Perfect.

429
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,180
You did great.

430
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,510
Okay,watch me.

431
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:32,610
There you go.

432
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,340
See that,you're
alreadyin the homestretch.

433
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:43,660
And voila.

434
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:47,800
-Perfect.
-Dad!

435
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,380
******

436
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,620
I've never really done
itby myself before.

437
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,130
My dad used to do itfor me.

438
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,910
You're doing fine,J.J.

439
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:16,550
He was gonna teach mea
lot of stuff this summer.

440
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:20,170
He was gonna teach me howto water ski.

441
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:24,700
He was gonna let me
ride the atvon the lake.

442
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:27,750
But we weren't gonna tell mom.

443
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:30,890
You won't tell her,will you?

444
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,510
No.

445
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:42,490
We would always joke about howhe was gonna
have to teach me to shave pretty soon.

446
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,820
"None of those electric
blades,"he'd say.

447
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,840
A real blade.

448
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:52,190
That's what a real guy uses.

449
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:02,390
I just-- I can't
believe he's gone.

450
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:08,740
Hey...

451
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:15,880
Me either.

452
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,900
People are startingto show up.

453
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,630
I don't wantto see anybody.

454
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:46,360
I'll just tell people
you're not feeling well.

455
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:49,540
I haven't cried yet.

456
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,390
Isn't that weird?

457
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,890
I mean,what will people say when
they seeI haven't been crying?

458
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:03,240
First I lose you and now I lose walt.

459
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:10,630
I must have banked
upsome really lousy karma.

460
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:18,150
It's not karma.

461
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,390
Then what the hell is it?

462
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,010
Can you explain it to me?

463
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:26,390
Because I don't understand it.

464
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,120
And can you explain how

465
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,800
you with all your visions

466
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,140
never saw this coming?

467
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,680
I mean,how could you miss this one?

468
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:52,240
Sarah,whatever happenedin the chapel...

469
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,820
whatever he was doing...

470
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,540
I'm sure that he died doing
something that he always did.

471
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,340
Something heroic.

472
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:07,370
That really doesn'tmake
me feel any better.

473
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,900
Walt tried to save someone and
so now I don't havea husband

474
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,310
and J.J.Doesn't havea father.

475
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,650
You know,our last
conversation was a fight.

476
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:20,180
And I think thatthat's the hardest part.

477
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:27,570
You know,the thought that he died
thinking that I was mad at him.

478
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:33,760
I never got to say good-bye.

479
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:39,710
And it's just somethingI'm
gonna have to live with.

480
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:45,620
And there's nothingyou
can do or say to help me.

481
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:54,630
We should go.

482
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,000
Man,I can't believe it.

483
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,160
Oh... never misses an
opportunityfor a photo-op.

484
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,090
never misses an
opportunityfor a photo-op.

485
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,190
I'm sorry.

486
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,820
It's a terrible tragedy.

487
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:40,980
Yeah,it is.

488
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:43,110
If there's anythingI can
do for you or the family

489
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,980
anything at all... let
me tell you something.

490
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:51,400
-If I find out you had anything to do with this
-his wife is pregnant with their child.

491
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,370
Walt was a good man.

492
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:56,360
We're all gonna miss him.

493
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:59,830
Certainly no one's
gonnamiss malcolm janus.

494
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:05,330
Agreed?

495
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,430
I'm not the man you think I am.

496
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:28,130
Sometimes fate deals usa strange hand.

497
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,900
On the day of the
faith heritage festival

498
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,910
a day when normally we
would celebrate community

499
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:42,360
cleaves mills lost oneof
its most beloved citizens

500
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,090
walt bannerman.

501
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:52,420
Cherished husband of
sarah,devoted father to J.J.

502
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,900
walt faced danger every day

503
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:05,380
with courage and con...

504
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:09,270
conviction.

505
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:16,050
We will never allow ourselvesto
forget walt bannerman.

506
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:21,270
We will not forget his sacrifice.

507
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,790
"There fore,we do not lose heart.

508
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,340

wasting away,"yet inwardly

00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:36,290
we are being ren ewed "day by day.

510

511
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,970
an eternal glory "that

512
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:48,290

513
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:51,420

00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:07,520
" Lovely eulogy,reverend purdy.

517
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,790
Thank you.

518
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,300
Gene.

519
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:20,670
Walt,is that you?

520
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,210
You denied stillson

521
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:28,160
the satellite feed and you thought
there wouldn't be consequences?

522
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:31,100
That is very braeof you,gene

523
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,380
I'm doing what's right.

524
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,500
Stillson is moving forward

525
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,900
ard and you will make that happen! -no!

526
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,320
You can keepleading stillson astray.

527
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,790
It stops right now with me.

528
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,730
I in tend to reclaimmy church!

529
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:52,120
Your church?!

530
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:55,970
It doesn't belongto you anymore!

531
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:57,580
No--unh!

532
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:02,420
I am reclaiming my church!

533
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,570
Gene,we gotta go.

534
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:24,140
Get the hell out of
here,get down--go,go,go

535
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,020
You were there.

536
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:43,630
Walt died saving you.

537
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,820
I still think you need
to goto the authorities

538
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,150
and just tell them what happened.

539
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,850
That I killedmalcolm janus?

540
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,850
In self defense.

541
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,050
The police will neverbelieve me.

542
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,090
I left walt there.

543
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,470
I saw what happenedat the chapel,gene.

544
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,380
There was nothing you could have done.

545
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:12,380
I'm responsible for
the deathsof two men.

546
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:16,660
How do I go aboutforgiving
myself for that?

547
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,620
Why was waltat the chapel?

548
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,320
He said we had to meet.

549
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,100
Why?

550
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,250
Something about you.

551
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,230
Me?

552
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,720
What about me?

553
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:45,660
I don't know.

554
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,560
I have to leave.

555
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,340
-To go where?
-I have no idea.

556
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,120
Ashes to ashes.

557
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:01,170
Gene.

558
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,880
I'm gonna turn downthat job offer.

559
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,950
Why?

560
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,640
Janus is dead.

561
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:13,730
Armageddon's over.

562
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:16,850
Take that job.

563
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,650
Try something new.

564
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:23,630
It's not gonna be the same,you know

565
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:27,020
having a psychicin my back pocket.

566
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,580
You know whereto find me.

567
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:33,610
Where am I going?

568
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:36,170
There's still somethingyou're
not telling me.

569
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:42,800
I saw gene die.

570
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,770
I called walt.

571
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:51,420
He went in to tryto save purdy.

572
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:57,250
-But if I hadn't done that...
-you tried to save

573
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:01,150
no,no,no,you know what
you did save him...twice.

574
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,070
What are you saying,that
walt was fated to die?

575
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:08,210
People maketheir own destiny.

576
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:13,380
Walt tried to save purdy.

577
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:16,270
He was doing his job.

578
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:22,170
-That case that walt wasworking on
-let it go.

579
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:25,660
I just feel likeI need to tell sarah

580
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:29,350
that I saw walt's death,you know?

581
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:31,850
I couldn't do anything.

582
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,640
Sarah does not need to know.

583
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:37,210
-Trust me on that.
-She deserves the truth.

584
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:41,420
-No,what sarah doesn't know
-would be a lie.

585
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:59,340
J.J.Said you were here.

586
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:08,130
What are you doing here?

587
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:12,230
I thought if I looked around,maybe I'd

588
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,330
... find out something.

589
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:16,560
I don't know...

590
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:21,710
maybe explain things

591
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:24,480
if I had justmade him stay.

592
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,270
It was his decision,sarah.

593
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:29,130
This mysterious case

594
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,550
walt did what he always did.

595
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:33,550
He put other people first.

596
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:36,120
But why did he cometo the chapel?

597
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,970
No one will tell me what happened.

598
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,910
All they did was give me his effects.

599
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:49,020
This is all I have left.

600
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:16,480
sarah...

601
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:20,250
what do you see?

602
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,320
Sarah...sarah...

603
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:28,790
he's saying your name.

604
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:34,290
No,you're--you're
just making that up.

605
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:38,770
Tell J.J.That I love him.

606
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:43,220
I've been the luckiest manalive.

607
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:46,480
Ti amo,sarah.

608
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:51,950
Ti amo.

609
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,060
Ti amo.

610
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:15,360
Ti amo,sarah.

611
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:21,420
Oh,my god,you saw him.

612
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:26,070
What else did he say?

613
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:42,880
To tell J.J.How muchhe loved him.

614
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:51,400
And that you made him feel
likethe luckiest man in the world.

615
00:39:56,890 --> 00:40:00,570
Did he suffer?

616
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,790
No.
