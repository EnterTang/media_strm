61
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:36,178
不过你们都错了
You guys are wrong. Yes, there is a chronological age difference.

但是我都感觉不到 为什么？因为她很成熟
But l never notice it, because she is very mature.

64
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:46,049
况且我根本不在意你们的看法
lt doesn't matter what you guys think. l'm dating Elizabeth, not you.

65
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,218
跟她交往的是我，不是你们

66
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,193
她昨晚可不是这么说的
Not what she said last night.

67
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,767
他配她就够幼稚
See, now, he could date her.

68
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:00,733

-So, what's going on here? -Well, this is a silent auction.

85
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,566
这是一场不喊价拍卖会

They lay the stuff here. You write down your offer.

87
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,073
出价最高的就是得主
Then the highest bid gets it.

88
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,208
我知道什么叫不喊价拍卖会
l know what a silent auction is. What's going on with your hair?

89
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,549
我是说你的头发怎么了？

怎么说？
-Why? -No, it's nice.

112
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,786

00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:20,456
什么？
What?

141
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:23,766
我没有2万
l don't have $20,000.

142
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,601
恭喜你购得新船… 乔伊崔比亚尼
Congratulations on your new boat, Joey Tribbiani.

143
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,304
坐下啦
Joey, sit down.

144
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:35,312
别理她，开心就好
Forget her. You enjoy this.

145
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,727
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

146
00:08:55,768 --> 00:09:00,102
一个国家，在神之下
''One nation...

147
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:02,970
...under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.''

148
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,573
不可分割，全民拥有 自由公正

149
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,735
我记得是这样背，香槟来了
l remembered it. The champagne is here.

150
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,039
你没事吧？
-You okay? -Yes. l'm good. Are you good?

151
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:13,244
我很好，你好吗？ 这一切…你很好吗？

152
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,650
ls everything--? Are you perfect?

153
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:16,185
还好，其实我有点冷
Yeah. l'm okay.

154
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:18,053
Actually, l'm a bit cold. Can l have your jacket?

155
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:17,813
外套可以借我吗？ 可以

156
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:20,788
不行，我的外套不能借你
No, you can't have my jacket.

157
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,029
因为那样我就会冷
Because then l would be cold.

158
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:28,123
你要是觉得会冷 应该自己带外套
lf you thought you'd be cold, you should've brought a jacket.

159
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:33,366
除此之外你好吗？
But, other than that, are you okay?

160
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,337
你真的没事吗？
-Are you sure you're okay? -Yes. l'm fine.

161
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:39,002
对，我很好

162
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:43,514
我这段日子一直都很好 我觉得…
ln fact, l've been fine for a long time now and l think...

163
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,246
都是拜你所赐
...the reason is you.

164
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,512
好甜蜜喔
That's sweet.

165
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,020
好…

166
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:57,221
认识你之前 我的人生微不足道
Before l met you, l had really little life.

167
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,424
我无法想像一个人…
-And l couldn't imagine growing old-- -Oh, my God.

168
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,660
我的天哪 我知道，不过让我说完
-l know. But let me say it. -Richard.

169
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,167
我的天哪，理查
What? l'm Chandler.

170
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,204
什么？我是钱德

171
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:10,239
那是理查
Oh, that's Richard.

172
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:14,345
天哪，也许他会没看见 理查
Maybe he won't see us. Richard!

173
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,442
摩妮卡，钱德
Monica. Chandler.

174
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:25,056
我不知道我为什么要抱你
l don't know why l did that.

175
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:27,622
见到你真好
-Good to see you. -You too. You let your hair grow.

176
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,025
彼此彼此，你把头发留长了

177
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,121
没错，你一直希望我留长
That's right. You always wanted me to.

178
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:34,961
你又开始留胡子了
-l see your mustache is back. -Well, my nose got lonely.

179
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:37,729
我的鼻子感到寂寞

180
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:40,772
你没留胡子，很好
You don't have a mustache, which is good.

181
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,069
我是钱德，我一蹩扭就开玩笑
Chandler. l make jokes when l'm uncomfortable.

182
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:48,043
我是丽莎
-Hi, l'm Lisa. -Hi.

183
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,377
抱歉，丽莎
l'm sorry. Lisa, Monica, Chandler. We used to date.

184
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,145
摩妮卡，钱德 我们交往过

185
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:56,380
理查，我们的事应该保密
Richard, no one's supposed to know about us.

186
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:00,519
我又来了
See? l did it again.

187
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:04,427
钱德，我们坐下吧 好，我坐
-Chandler, sit down. -l'll sit down.

188
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,762
很高兴见到你
-Good to see you. -Your table's ready, sir.

189
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,662
您的桌子准备好了

190
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,632
很高兴遇见你们 好
Good to see you guys.

191
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:11,726
这一桌也是空的
lf you prefer, this table's available.

192
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:15,005
一起坐应该不错
That might be fun.

193
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:23,476
你在想什么？
-What were you thinking? -l didn't know it was an auction.

194
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:25,516
我不知道这是拍卖会 什么？

195
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:29,714
我以为是猜一猜 帮助慈善团体，免费得帆船
l figured l'd take a guess. Help a charity. Free boat!

196
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:33,489
慈善团体为什么要送帆船？
Why would a charity give away a boat?

197
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:36,152
我哪知，做慈善吗？
l don't know. Charity?

198
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,589
你就买吧
Well, just buy the damn boat.

199
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,797
菲比，你喝得够多了吧？
Don't you think you've had enough to drink?

200
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:45,803
我只是在帮助儿童
l'm just helping the kids.

201
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:50,174
你喝酒怎么能帮助儿童？
How is you drinking helping the kids?

202
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:54,576
我喝得越多 孩子们能喝的就越少
Because the more l drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.

203
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,749
崔比亚尼先生
Mr. Tribbiani, your contribution brings us...

204
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:04,482
你的慷慨解囊 让兴建活动中心的事大有进展
...a step closer to building the youth center.

205
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:08,890
我很高兴你带他来 我也是
-l'm so happy you brought him. -So am l.

206
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,827
我很好奇，那艘船值多少？
l'm curious. How much is that boat worth?

207
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:14,263
差不多是1万9
-l think it was valued at 1 9,000. -Hey, l was pretty close.

208
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,425
我猜得蛮准的

209
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:25,534
坏消息 我不能买那艘船，我没有钱
So, bad news.

210
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:25,936
l can't buy the boat. l don't have any money.

211
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:33,450
乔伊，你真幽默
Joey! Joey, good one. He's silly.

212
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,645
你真会演
Good! Very good!

213
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,853
好吧，我来闪了
-So l think l'm gonna take off now. -You can't leave, Joey!

214
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:45,089
你不能走，乔伊

215
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:48,291
你答应要买船，具有约束力
You agreed to buy that boat. lt's a contract.

216
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,301
而且你走了 我的主管会宰了我
Plus, if you leave, my boss will kill me.

217
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:54,065
那怎么办？我没有那么多钱
l don't have that kind of money.

218
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:56,266
我知道，好…
l know. Okay, okay. This is what we'll do.

219
00:12:56,375 --> 00:13:00,004
好，这样吧 我们去找出价第二高的人
We'll let the next highest bidder buy it.

220
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:04,173
然后让他们去买 你只要付差价

221
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,046
Then you'll pay the difference.

222
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,250
好
Okay. l don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway.

223
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:08,411
这些小孩要活动中心干嘛

224
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:11,149
放了学跟我一样看电视就好了
They should just watch TV after school like l did. l turned out fine.

225
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,952
我现在也蛮好的

226
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:16,285
但是不优秀
Not great.

227
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:22,094
我帮助贫童帮到想吐
l'm helping the kids so much l think l'm gonna throw up.

228
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,730
我们躲在洗手间里
So we're hiding in the bathroom....

229
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:28,136
然后我溜出来
l get out. But before she can, her parents come in.

230
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,401
但摩妮卡还没出来 她父母就进去了

231
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:35,173
于是我躲到浴帘后面 接着他们就在地上做起来了
l hide in the shower. They start going at it on the floor.

232
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:36,373
我的天哪
Oh, my God!

233
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,915
我有一个，我有一个
l got a good one.

234
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:42,010
我有一次撞见我父母 跟同一个男人做爱
l once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.

235
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:53,731
遇见你们真的好开心 我想敬酒
lt's so great seeing you guys again. l'd like to make a toast.

236
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,098
正如一位诗人所说 “在友谊的甜蜜里”
As a poet once said, ''ln the sweetness of friendship...

237
00:13:57,203 --> 00:14:00,798
“尽情欢笑，分享欢乐吧”
...let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures.

238
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:05,741
“人心正是从中获得朝气” “焕然一新”
ln the dew of little things, the heart finds its morning and is refreshed.''

239
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:10,274
什么？
What?

240
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,587
天哪，你们
Oh, my God! You guys!

241
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,217
在你开口之前，我们有事要说
Have we got a story for you. Guess who we bumped into?

242
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,353
你猜我们吃饭时遇见谁？ 谁？
-Who? -Richard!

243
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:26,294
理查 什么？

244
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,296
没错，那里也是理查的最爱
Right, that's Richard's favorite place too.

245
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:34,804
所以你知道？很好
-Oh, you knew that? Good. -Weren't you going out with Elizabeth?

246
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,704
你不是要跟伊丽莎白约会？

247
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:41,576
没错，但是她忙着打水球仗
l was. She was a little busy with a water balloon fight.

248
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,309
有时大人就是会有事无法脱身
Sometimes grownups have commitments they can't get out of.

249
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,713
也许她真的太年轻了
Maybe she is too young for me.

250
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:53,349
当我看到她跟朋友横冲直撞 我觉得我好像保姆
When l was over there, l felt like l was a babysitter.

251
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:56,519
我终于开始了解你们的话
l see what you were talking about. l don't know what to do.

252
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:57,391
我不知道该怎么办
Weigh the good stuff about her against the bad.

253
00:14:57,496 --> 00:15:01,364
你可以比较这段感情的利弊

254
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,901
我当初就是这样…
That's what l did when l first started...weighing stuff.

255
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,493
比较东西的

256
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,134
好，弊
Okay, bad stuff. l'm 1 2 years older than she is.

257
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,709
我比她大12岁

258
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,710
学校发现会开除你
The school could fire you.

259
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:16,280
她要离开3个月 去参加夏令营
-She's leaving for three months. -For camp.

260
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,452
好，利
Okay, good stuff.

261
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:23,578
她很甜很漂亮…
Well, she's sweet and pretty and--

262
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,554
性爱方面很赞吧？
And the sex is probably great, huh?

263
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:31,328
如果你是指很温柔又互相尊重
lt's tender and respectful, if that's what you mean.

264
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:37,860
罗斯，你只需要问你自己 你看得见未来吗？
The only thing you need to ask is, ''Do you see a future?''

265
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,406
你能想像跟她结婚吗？
Do you see yourself marrying her?

266
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:44,499
天哪，你已经娶她了对不对？
My God. You married her, didn't you?

267
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:50,648
没有啦，我只是…
No, l didn't do that. lt's just....

268
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:56,346
好吧，我觉得我们没什么未来
Okay, honestly, no. l don't see a big future with her.

269
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,288
那这就是你的答案了
Okay, l think that's your answer.

270
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:02,292
我得告诉她 我最恨这个步骤了
l gotta talk to her. l hate this part.

271
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:03,861
你必须忘记伊丽莎白
Forget Elizabeth. lf you're not careful...

272
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:08,423
你要是不小心 今年可能会结不到婚
...you may not get married at all this year.

273
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,067
你今晚不是要做某件事？
-Weren't you supposed to do something? -Good luck with Elizabeth, my man.

274
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,644
祝分手顺利

275
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:36,618
天哪，菲比，你喝了几杯？
My God, Phoebe, how many have you had?

276
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:39,459
一，二，三… 七乘以三，二十一杯
1 , 2, 3.... Seven times three-- 21 !

277
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:43,931
你一定醉翻了
-You must be just wasted! -l'm a little tired.

278
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:45,435
是有点累

279
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,338
瑞秋
-Next highest bidder is at table one. -Great.

280
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,000
出价第二高的人在一号桌 太好了

281
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,307
标到巴黎之旅的人坐四号桌 好
The guy with the Paris trip is at table four.

282
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,438
你干嘛管谁赢得巴黎之旅？
-Why do you care about who won? -lt's a trip for two.

283
00:16:56,548 --> 00:17:00,109
那是双人之旅，失陪

284
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,384
Excuse me.

285
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:09,554
抱歉，标到巴黎之旅的人 在这一桌吗？
ls the person who won the Paris trip at this table?

286
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:10,889
我就是
-That was me. -Enchant茅.

287
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:12,463
真迷人

288
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:20,231
抱歉，有没有一位波芒先生？ 我就是
-ls there a Mr. Bowmont at this table? -That's me.

289
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:25,605
你好 你今天走运了，波芒先生
Well, hello. This is your lucky day, Mr. Bowmont.

290
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,579
那艘帆船又要卖了
The Gentleman Daysailer has become available again...

291
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:32,946
你开了1万8的价格
...and l believe you made a bid of $ 1 8,000.

292
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,486
你得付钱，不是猜好玩的
You have to pay that. lt's not just a guess.

293
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:43,794
我没标到船还松了一口气 我老婆会宰了我
l was relieved l didn't win. My wife would've killed me.

294
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,830
不会吧？她会爱死这艘船
You kidding? She'll love this boat!

295
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:48,161
是啊，尊夫人芳名？
-What is your wife's name? -Pam.

296
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:49,097
她叫潘

297
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:52,534
潘，天哪，想像一下

298
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:54,469
Just imagine this: The Pam.

299
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,265
“潘号”

300
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:58,206
我想她不会喜欢
l don't think she'd like that.

301
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:02,970
那想像…“波芒先生号”
Okay. lmagine this: The Mr. Bowmont.

302
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:04,873
还是不要了
-l don't think so. -Let me paint you a little picture.

303
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:07,383
让我为你描绘一下

304
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,977
你在哈德逊河上航行
You are setting sail up the Hudson. You've got the wind in your...arms.

305
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,058
风吹过你的头…左手

306
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:18,954
你得到你企盼已久的安宁
You get all that peace and quiet you've always wanted.

307
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:22,124
你回到大自然怀抱 你可以钓鱼
You get back to nature. You can go fishing.

308
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:25,965
你可以买一顶帽子 让大家叫你船长
You get one of those hats. People call you captain.

309
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:28,596
等你老了就是老船长
And then when you're old, Cappy.

310
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,476
管他的，不买说不过去 我买了
-lt's for a good cause. All right. -No way! lt's mine!

311
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:34,546
你别想，船是我的

312
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:35,908
什么？
What?

313
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:37,982
什么？
-The stuff you said, l want that! -But you don't have $20,000!

314
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,051
你刚才说的那些事我也要

315
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:42,780
但是乔伊，你没有2万

316
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:46,380
管他的，我分期，怎样都好 我要“波芒先生号”
Who cares? l'll make payments! l want the Mr. Bowmont!

317
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,098
天哪，你们回来了
-Oh, my God. You're back. -Let me see it. Let me see your hand.

318
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:56,861
让我看你的手，让我看你的手

319
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,327
你为什么要看我的手？
Why do you wanna see my hand?

320
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:02,669
我想看你手上拿的垃圾
l wanna see what's in your hand. l wanna see the trash.

321
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:08,813
好脏，你最好拿去扔
lt's all dirty. You should throw this out.

322
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:11,846
好

323
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:15,920
你们搞什么？
-What did you just do? -What happened?

324
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:16,953
怎么回事？
-Richard was there. l couldn't do it. -Oh, no.

325
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:18,784
理查也在，我无法开口

326
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,415
不会吧

327
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:25,054
我要延到明天，给她惊喜 却被你们破坏了
l was gonna surprise her tomorrow.

328
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,893
-Now you've ruined it. -We didn't.

329
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,028
我们没有破坏
Who walks in a room and asks to see a person's hands?

330
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:29,498
谁会一进门就要看别人的手？

331
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:34,732
算命师、修指甲的小姐 手部医生…
A palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor....

332
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,365
手套推销员 漂亮
-Glove salesman. -Good one!

333
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,745
真惨，我该怎么办？
This is terrible. What will l do?

334
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:46,784
她只是在怀疑，又不是确定 你可以唬她
She only suspects something. So just throw her off the track.

335
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:50,321
也对，我可以让她觉得 我完全不考虑结婚
l'll pretend marriage is the last thing on my mind.

336
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:53,391
没错，让她相信你很害怕承诺
Convince her you're scared of commitment, that you're a coward.

337
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,460
让她相信你有点孬种

338
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:58,428
我做得到，我练了30年
l can do that. l've had years of practice.

339
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,328
你这个人总算有价值了
Being you is finally gonna pay off!

340
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:04,735
我跑去地下室扔
Some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes.

341
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:08,966
某个白痴小孩老是用披萨盒 把垃圾槽堵住

342
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,508
那个家伙还是没改？
That guy is still doing that?

343
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,311
天哪，你们回来了 我看看你的手
Oh, my God. Let me see your hand!

344
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:19,578
来不及了 她已经把垃圾拿去扔了
You're too late! She already took out the trash!

345
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:41,071
伊丽莎白，我们得谈一谈
Look, Elizabeth, we have to talk.

346
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:52,841
我跟别人分手没这么平和过
I have never had such a healthy breakup.

347
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:56,879
她表现得好成熟
She was such a grownup about it.

348
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,890
我觉得她一点也不幼稚
She didn't seem too immature for me.

349
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:04,384
我是不是犯了个大错？
Did I just make a huge mistake?

350
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:06,225
罗斯，等等
Ross! Wait!

351
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:09,562
伊丽莎白，太好了 我正在想说…
Elizabeth, thank God. l was just thinking about--

352
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,966
你最烂了
You suck!

353
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,435
什么？
What?

354
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:23,442
好，分手还是有效

355
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:23,278
Breakup's still on.

356
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:37,955
她来了 我像不像不想结婚的人？
Here she comes. Do l look like l don't wanna get married?

357
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:42,693
像，还有点像法国人
And, also, a little like a French guy.

358
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:47,497
我第一次发现
l never noticed that before.

359
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,874
你们在干什么？
-What are you up to? -Hanging out. Talking about websites.

360
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:55,105
只是在杀时间，聊网站

361
00:21:57,516 --> 00:22:03,079
有一个网站在讨论婚姻 及婚姻的一无是处
We saw this interesting website about marriage...

362
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:05,950
...and how unnecessary it is, a way for the government to keep tabs.

363
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,656
说那只是政府监视你的方式

364
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:07,520
是啊，专制
Yeah, Big Brother.

365
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:14,793
有点夸张，不过你们总算上了 其他类别的网站
That's a bit crazy.

366
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:15,395
Although l am glad you're looking at other things on the lnternet.

367
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:19,860
不过我就想 为什么会有人想要结婚？
Got me thinking. Why would anybody want to get married?

368
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:24,237
为什么？因为要赞颂这段感情 要巩固你们的承诺
To celebrate the relationship, solidify the commitment...

369
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,403
要向全世界宣布你们的爱
...declare your love for one another to the world.

370
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:33,447
能知道你的反应真好
Well, that's good to know.

371
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,053
“波芒先生号”来了
The Mr. Bowmont is here!

372
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:46,724
摩妮卡 有一位客人想向主厨致意
A diner wants to compliment you. Shall l let him in?

373
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:47,628
要让他进来吗？
Sure. l love this part.

374
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,792
当然，我最爱这种事了

375
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:52,030
进来吧
-Come on in. -Hi.

376
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:55,439
理查
-Richard. -l'm not here to compliment the chef.

377
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,974
其实我不是来向主厨致意的

378
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:01,740
没关系 我最讨厌客人跑来致意
l hate when people come back to compliment the chef.

379
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,508
好像我很闲似的
Like l have nothing better to do.

380
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:06,651
你有什么事？
So, what's up?

381
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,744
那天晚上遇见你很开心
lt was great seeing you the other night.

382
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:11,288
我也很开心
Good to see you too.

383
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:14,816
你就是来说这个的？
-You came to tell me that? -l came to tell you something else.

384
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:18,123
不是，我是来说别的

385
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:23,828
我是来说我仍然爱你
l came here to tell you l still love you.

386
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:28,804
什么？你刚才…什么？
What? What did you--? What?

387
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:32,607
我仍然爱你
l still love you.

388
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:36,340
我知道我甚至不该告诉你
l know l shouldn't even be here telling you this.

389
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,678
你跟钱德在一起，我很喜欢他
You're with Chandler, who l like.

390
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:41,082
你说他是异性恋，我就相信你
lf you say he's straight, l'll believe you.

391
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:46,881
但见到你之后 我知道我不说会后悔一辈子
After seeing you, l knew if l didn't tell you l'd regret it.

392
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:50,052
放弃你是我所做过最蠢的事
Letting you go was the stupidest thing l ever did.

393
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:54,230
你不该到厨房来的
You're really not supposed to be back here.

394
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:56,027
我知道，对不起
l'm sorry. l know this is the wrong time and the wrong place...

395
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:59,228
我知道时机地点都不对 但是…

396
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:01,737
我一定要说
...but l had to tell you.

397
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,570
我想跟你共度一生，我想娶你
l wanna spend my life with you. l wanna marry you.

398
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:08,370
我想跟你生儿育女
l wanna have kids with you.

399
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,975
这里为什么没摆椅子？
Oh, my God. Why don't they put chairs back here?

400
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,548
我知道我很扯 已经来不及了吗？
Look, l know this is crazy, but am l too late?

401
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:23,094
没错 你3年前怎么不说这些话？
You're too late. Where was all this three years ago?

402
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:25,823
我知道，我是个白痴
l know. l was an idiot.

403
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:28,456
我也想忘记你，真的
l tried to forget you. l really did.

404
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:30,000
我们去年吃完饭
After our last lunch, l spent six months in Africa trying to forget.

405
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:33,662
我跑去非洲6个月想忘记你

406
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:36,969
你去非洲做什么？ 帮助盲童
-What did you do there? -Work with blind kids.

407
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:39,236
你折磨我嘛
What are you doing to me?

408
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:41,635
Look, l....

409
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:45,640
很抱歉，我们之间是不可能的
l'm sorry, but this is not gonna happen.

410
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:49,379
好，我会离开 再也不会来烦你
That's fine. l'll walk away. l'll never bother you again.

411
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:53,788
但前提是 钱德也愿意给你这一切
Only if you say Chandler's willing to give you everything l am.

412
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:55,416
他愿意
Well, he is. l mean...

413
00:24:55,527 --> 00:25:00,260
没错，他成天把婚姻挂在嘴边
...marriage is all he talks about. My goodness!

414
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:03,198
事实上是我在让他等
ln fact, l'm the one making him wait.

415
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:04,632
是吗？ 对
You are? Why?

416
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:06,363
为什么？
Why?

417
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:09,468
因为政府的阴谋
Because of the government.

418
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:19,514
很棒吧？ 摩妮卡和钱德要结婚了
lsn't it incredible?

419
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:19,407
Monica and Chandler are getting married.

420
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:23,019
就是啊，他们会很幸福
l know. They'll be so happy together.

421
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:25,851
两个最要好的朋友坠入爱河 这种机率有多大？
How often do two best friends fall in love?

422
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:27,720
并不太大 没错
-Not that often. -No.

423
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:30,724
我好替他们开心
-l'm so happy for them. -Me too. So happy for them.

424
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:33,855
我也是，好开心

425
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:36,866
我很高兴，毫无嫉妒之心
l'm so happy and not at all jealous.

426
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:40,199
没错，当然没有
Oh, no! God, definitely not jealous.

427
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:49,613
我可能是98%开心2%嫉妒
l'm probably 98% happy and maybe 2% jealous.

428
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:52,615
2%等于没有 没错
-l mean, what's 2%? That's nothing. -Totally.

429
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,850
我是九比一 我也是
-l'm like 90/1 0. -Yeah. Me too.

430
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,954
你们有见到钱德吗？
Have you guys seen Chandler?

431
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:13,429
没有，但你知道谁来找过你？
No. But you know who was looking for you?

432
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:15,165
坦妮尔 （“船长与坦妮尔”为乐团）
Tennille.

433
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:27,041
你昨天说的那些话
The marriage stuff you were saying yesterday? You don't believe that.

434
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:30,121
应该不是真心话吧？ 当然是
Sure, l do. ln fact, l think the concept of marriage is unnatural.

435
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:34,021
事实上我觉得婚姻本身 就很不近人情

436
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:38,494
你看猪嘛，我们来看一下猪
Look at pigs. Let's take a second here and look at pigs.

437
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,292
猪不会有固定配偶
Pigs don't mate for life.

438
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:44,095
猪的一生可以有一百个性伴侣
A pig can have 1 00 sexual partners in a lifetime.

439
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:47,763
那还只是普通的猪 而不是擅长运动的猪
That's an ordinary pig, not even a pig that's good at sports.

440
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:53,806
对，但那是猪不是人
Yeah, but that's pigs, not people.

441
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:58,349
如果结婚行得通，我绝对支持 但是你知道美国的离婚率吗？
lf marriage worked, l'd be for it. Do you know the divorce rate?

442
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,174
Ninety-seven percent!

443
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:03,813
等一下
Wait a minute.

444
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:07,653
你是说你可能永远都不想结婚
Are you telling me you may never want to get married?

445
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:11,388
谁晓得？ 你啊，你晓得
-Who's to say? -You! You are to say!

446
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:14,522
话不能说死，不过应该是…
Never say never, but, probably...

447
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,760
永远不会
...yeah, never.

448
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:21,066
天哪，那我们在干什么？ 现在是怎样？
Oh, my God. Then what are we even doing? What is this?

449
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:24,232
干嘛对我施压？
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What is all this pressure?

450
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:27,143
这是某种新策略吗？
ls this some new strategy?

451
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:30,908
你别再搞尔虞我诈那一套了
Why don't you put down your copy of The Rules, huh, mantrap?

452
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:34,041
你知道吗？我要走了
You know what? l gotta go.

453
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:39,382
放心，我自有打算
lt's okay. l got a plan.

454
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:48,092
我们会找到真爱的 一定会的
-We're gonna find love. -Definitely.

455
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,361
我对这点有信心
Yeah, l'm pretty confident about that.

456
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:56,373
所以我可以有八成 替摩妮卡和钱德高兴
That's what makes it so easy to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler.

457
00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:59,937
不过要是有保障就好了
-A guarantee would be nice. -What do you mean?

458
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:00,875
什么意思？
Some friends make a deal.

459
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:04,437
有些人不是会跟朋友约定

460
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:08,383
要是两个人到了40都没结婚 他们就要结婚
Like if neither of them are married by 40, they marry each other.

461
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:10,386
你是指备胎？ 没错
-A backup? -Exactly.

462
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:11,748
我已经找好了
Yeah, l've got that.

463
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,117
你找好了？
You do?

464
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:16,625
是谁？ 乔伊
-Who? -Joey.

465
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:18,719
乔伊？ 对
-Joey? Are you serious? -l locked him in years ago.

466
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:22,322
真的还假的？ 我好几年前就锁定他了

467
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:28,636
所以要是你们40岁还没结婚
Wait. So if neither of you are married by 40, you'll marry Joey?

468
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,866
你就要嫁给乔伊
Yep. We shook on it.

469
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:31,669
对，我们握手为定

470
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:36,207
不过他可不想就此打住
But believe me, that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.

471
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:38,877
是吗？
Oh, seriously?

472
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:41,383
对，他说的是…
l think his exact words were--

473
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:46,119
真迷人
Charming.

474
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,816
只是个备胎
He's just a backup.

475
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:57,934
摩妮卡
-Hey, Monica. -Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?

476
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:00,266
你有见到瑞秋吗？或是镜子？

477
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:04,073
这是我的船长装，酷吧？
-lt's for my boat. Pretty cool, huh? -Yeah, it's great.

478
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:05,665
很酷
What's wrong? Talk to the captain.

479
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:07,904
怎么了？告诉船长

480
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:13,744
我又发现这段感情是死路一条
Just realizing l'm in a dead-end relationship.

481
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,513
钱德欺负你是吧？
-Chandler being difficult? -l don't want marriage tomorrow.

482
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,588
我又不是明天就要结婚

483
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:22,456
我只是想知道 我不是在原地打转，浪费时间
But l wanna know we're going somewhere, that l'm not wasting time.

484
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,584
你也了解钱德
-You know Chandler. -No, l don't know Chandler.

485
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:26,789
我已经不了解钱德了

486
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:30,231
仿佛有什么事变了
Not anymore. lt's like something's changed.

487
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:32,200
也许是你变了？
-Maybe you changed. -l didn't change.

488
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:34,100
我才没变

489
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:36,002
也许问题就在这里
Maybe that's the problem.

490
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:38,601
什么？
-What? -Chandler is a complex fellow.

491
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:42,942
钱德很复杂，不太可能成亲

492
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,308
One who is unlikely to take a wife.

493
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:47,517
这是跑船人的用语吗？
ls that some kind of boat talk?

494
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:51,647
我还没想好在船上的说话风格
l haven't totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.

495
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:57,326
他以为我会空等下去吗？
Does he think l'll wait around for nothing?

496
00:29:57,428 --> 00:30:03,162
面对现实吧，钱德反对婚姻 他是不会变了
Face it. Chandler is against marriage.

497
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:02,897
And always will be.

498
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:07,066
有些人可是真心想娶我
There's some people who do wanna marry me.

499
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:08,104
有吗？
-There are? -Yeah. Richard.

500
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:10,106
有，理查

501
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,608
理查说他想娶你？
Richard said he wants to marry you?

502
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:17,309
钱德说他痛恨婚姻？ 没错
-And Chandler says he hates marriage? -That's right.

503
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:19,679
钱德热爱婚姻
Chandler loves marriage!

504
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:24,152
你刚才说他痛恨婚姻
You just said he hates marriage!

505
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:27,816
说他很复杂，不太可能娶妻
''He's a complex fellow who's unlikely to take a wife'' !

506
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:30,918
说他会永远反对婚姻
''He's against marriage and always will be'' !

507
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:33,691
你的解读是这样？
You got that from what l said?

508
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:43,299
白垩纪结束，恐龙也从此绝迹
After the Cretaceous Period, the dinosaurs were gone.

509
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:45,774
你们究竟怎么了？
What happened, you guys?

510
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:55,176
瑞秋 帅哥
-Rach. -Hey, you.

511
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,316
请进 谢谢
-Come on in. -Thank you.

512
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:02,450
很遗撼你跟伊丽莎白分手了
l'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.

513
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,826
谢谢，我以为我们能克服万难 不过…
Thanks. l really thought we'd be able to make it work.

514
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:09,058
这大概是命中注定的
l guess it wasn't meant to be.

515
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:13,399
是啊，爱情…爱情真是微妙
Yeah. Love. lt's a tricky business, isn't it?

516
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:16,506
是啊
-l guess so. -So, what do you say we make a pact?

517
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:18,906
我们要不要来做个约定

518
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:22,605
要是我们到了40都还没结婚 我们就结婚
lf you and l are both single by 40, we get married.

519
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,877
我们互相认识，互相喜欢
l mean, we know each other, we like each other...

520
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:29,647
我们已经上过床，不会有意外
...we've already slept together, so there'll be no surprises.

521
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:31,813
不会觉得“搞什么？”
No, like, ''What's that?''

522
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:39,955
你想找我当备胎？ 没错
-Oh, you want me to be your backup. -Exactly.

523
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,964
我已经有备胎了
Yeah. l already have one.

524
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:44,733
是谁？ 菲比
-What? Who? -Phoebe.

525
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:46,827
菲比？
Phoebe?

526
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:49,736
但是她说乔伊是她的备胎
But she just said Joey is her backup.

527
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:51,638
才不是呢
Oh, l don't think so.

528
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:56,946
罗斯，我刚跟她聊过 她说她和乔伊约好了
We just spoke. She said that she and Joey made a deal.

529
00:31:57,048 --> 00:32:01,849
不可能的，我们早就约好了 还握手为定
That's impossible. We have had a deal for years. We shook on it.

530
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:05,354
只不过她觉得握手还不够…
Although, believe me, she wanted to do a lot more than that.

531
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:11,588
阿甘，我是乔伊，钱德在吗？
Gunther, it's Joey. ls Chandler there?

532
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:15,154
我问你，跑船都吃哪一种松糕
Listen. What kind of muffins do they serve at sea?

533
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:20,403
你上哪去了？
Where the hell have you been?!

534
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:23,565
我在跟教授做椰子电话
l was making a coconut phone with the Professor.

535
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,707
理查跟摩妮卡说他想娶她
Richard told Monica he wants to marry her.

536
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:29,472
什么？
-What? -l've been trying to find you.

537
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,447
就是啊，我一直想去找你 叫你别玩了

538
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:37,044
可是这双鞋子跑一跑就掉
And l would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!

539
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:39,623
我的天哪 就是啊，烂死了
-Oh, my God! -l know! They suck!

540
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:43,183
他不该向我的女朋友求婚 该求婚的人是我
He's not supposed to ask her to marry him! l am!

541
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,921
我知道 那…
-l know! -What--?

542
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:48,430
你知道吗？我要去找他教训他
You know what l'll do? l'll go over there and kick his ass!

543
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,566
你愿意帮忙吗？
Will you help me?

544
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:57,267
钱德，被他海扁一顿不是办法
Look, l don't think us getting our asses kicked is a solution, okay?

545
00:32:57,375 --> 00:33:00,276
赶快去找摩妮卡吧
-Look, just go and find Monica. -You're right.

546
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:01,811
你说得对，好
Okay. l'm gonna get the ring...

547
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:04,143
我去拿戒指，我去拿戒指

548
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:07,183
我要找到她，直接向她求婚
...l'm gonna go find her and l'm gonna propose!

549
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:08,411
好
Dude! Dude! Dude!

550
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,009
老兄 怎样？

551
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:13,284
你的椰子电话 也许很适合摆在船上
That coconut phone might be good for the boat.

552
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,434
Hi.

553
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:33,273
Hi.

554
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,378
我不知道我来干什么
l don't know why l'm here.

555
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:39,973
我又没问
l didn't ask.

556
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,250
你要进来吗？ 我不知道
-You wanna come in? -l don't know.

557
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:47,719
好吧
Oh, okay.

558
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:52,019
那我把门开着，回去坐下
l'll just leave the door open and sit on the couch.

559
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:56,857
钱德真是个白痴
-Chandler is such an idiot! -Drink?

560
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:58,128
喝酒？

561
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:03,604
好，我要威士忌加… 冰块和莱姆片？我记得
-Scotch on the-- -Rocks with a twist?

562
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,897
l remember.

563
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,573
还在抽雪茄？
You still smoking cigars?

564
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:12,680
没有，那是艺术
No, no. That's art.

565
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,646
如果你不喜欢 我可以把艺术熄掉
lf it bothers you, l can put my art out.

566
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:19,346
没关系
No, that's okay.

567
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,889
摩妮卡，我问你一件事
So, Monica, let me ask you a question.

568
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:30,832
我们分手后，你想过我吗？
Since we broke up, do you ever...

569
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,627
...think about me?

570
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:34,496
我2个月前还想到你
Actually, l thought about you a few months ago.

571
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:35,367
是吗？
-Really? -But it's because...

572
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:40,206
不过是因为我去做眼睛检查 又不喜欢我的新医生
...l had an eye exam, and l don't like my new eye doctor.

573
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:43,637
是谁？ 爱德华奈夫斯基
-Who is it? -Edward Nevsky.

574
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,477
他的确很差
He's no good.

575
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:53,090
你有想过非眼科医生的我吗？
Do you ever think about me...

576
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:54,116
-...in a non-eye-doctor way? -No.

577
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:54,215
没有

578
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:02,130
但忘记你是我这辈子最难的事
Because getting over you was the hardest thing l've ever done.

579
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,701
我不让自己想到你
l never let myself think about you.

580
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:08,095
Wow.

581
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,100
菲比
Phoebe, you picked Joey and Ross?

582
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:18,615
你找了乔伊和罗斯？ 你不能有两个备胎

583
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:20,048
-You can't have two backups! -Of course l can.

584
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:23,176
当然可以 眼光独到才会替备胎找备胎

585
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:23,118
lt's good sense to back up your backup.

586
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,915
我已经折损钱德了 什么？
-Look, l've already lost Chandler. -What?

587
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:29,860
菲比，我们都是你的备胎？
Hey, Phoebe! We're both your backup?

588
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:33,089
菲比，你怎么可以这样？
How could you do this to me?

589
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:37,600
我不知道你们在抱怨什么 你们都知道这个状况
Why are you complaining? You were both aware of the situation.

590
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:39,795
我们不知道 我不知道
-l was not! -No, we weren't!

591
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:43,340
婚后你们可不能这样顶嘴
This kind of backtalk won't fly when we're married.

592
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:46,675
菲比，你不能独占他们 你得选一个
You can't have both. Pick one.

593
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:50,304
选我 不，选我，我不想当老处女
-Pick me! -No, pick me!

594
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:53,473
-l don't wanna end up an old maid. -All right. Well, let's see.

595
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:52,943
好吧，我看看

596
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:56,344
罗斯是个好爸爸
Ross is a good father.

597
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:59,787
但是乔伊有船，好难选喔
But...

598
00:35:57,755 --> 00:36:00,087
...Joey has a boat. This is hard.

599
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:02,753
太扯了，我要换成瑞秋
This is crazy. l wanna switch to Rachel.

600
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,225
我也要换成瑞秋
-l wanna switch to Rachel too. -No, wait. Just wait.

601
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,626
不，等一下

602
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:10,360
你们别急着做决定
Wait, guys. Don't make any rash decisions.

603
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:15,838
记得我的承诺吧？结婚之后 1星期三次
Just remember my promise:

604
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:15,663
lf we get married, three times a week.

605
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:20,070
天哪，菲比 我是说按摩
Oh, my God. Phoebe....

606
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:20,076
l'm talking about massages.

607
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:22,438
No, I'm not.

608
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,447
我知道该怎么解决了 办法就是
l know how to settle it. We'll do this.

609
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:35,686
我在一张纸巾上写乔伊 一张纸巾上写罗斯
l'm gonna write ''Joey'' on one napkin...

610
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:37,224
...and ''Ross'' on the other napkin and we're gonna pick one.

611
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:39,354
然后我们一人选一张 那个人就是我们的备胎

612
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:40,226
That person will be our backup. Okay?

613
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:40,361
好吗？
-Sounds fair. -All right.

614
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:41,954
很公平

615
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:43,863
那好，我来弄乱
Good. Switching them up.

616
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,370
选一边 左边
-Pick one. -Left.

617
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:52,570
谢谢 不客气
-Thank you. -You're welcome.

618
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:59,640
罗斯 乔伊
-Ross. -Joey.

619
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,411
我们交换好了 没错
-We should switch. -Absolutely.

620
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:09,658
我想念你 丑不啦叽的扁脸老怪物
l missed you, you ugly flat-faced old freak.

621
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:13,830
你说什么？
Excuse me?

622
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:16,266
他啦
Him.

623
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:24,368
我想念这间房子 这才是大人的房子
l missed this apartment. Now, this is a grownup's apartment.

624
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:26,739
我应该跟大人在一起，你懂吧
l should be with a grownup, you know?

625
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:29,244
懂，你是说
You're saying you need to be with someone more mature.

626
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:32,316
你要跟比较成熟的人在一起

627
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:37,854
也许是一个…有医师执照的人
Maybe someone with...

628
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:37,614
...a license to practice medicine.

629
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:39,422
或是有胡子的人
Or a mustache.

630
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:43,785
说真的，我不是小孩子了
Let's face it. l'm not a kid anymore.

631
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:46,863
我需要一个目标相同的人
l need someone who wants the same things.

632
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:51,060
来我工作的地方跟我示爱 我要的是那样
Coming to my work and telling me you love me, l want that!

633
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:55,302
吃饭时聊猪的性爱 我不要那样
Talking about pig sex over lunch, l don't want that!

634
00:37:57,141 --> 00:37:58,904
很公平
l think that's fair.

635
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:02,275
公平？别跟我提公平
Please, don't even talk to me about fair.

636
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:05,372
公平的意思是你当年想娶我
Fair would've been you wanting to marry me then.

637
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:07,974
或是钱德现在想娶我
Or Chandler wanting to marry me now.

638
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:10,178
这整件事一点也不公平
Believe me, nothing about this is fair. Nothing.

639
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:14,725
不公平不公平不公平… 别激动
-Nothing! Nothing! -lt's okay.

640
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:20,328
不公平
Nothing.

641
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:28,136
我不…我不知道
l don't know.

642
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,197
l don't know.

643
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,269
我知道
l know.

644
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:39,048
我得先把事情想清楚

645
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:37,211
l have to figure some--

646
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,077
Some stuff, before l can....

647
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,448
然后才能… 我懂
l understand.

648
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:44,783
你只管慢慢想
Take as much time as you want.

649
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:48,557
10分钟、20分钟都行
Ten, even 20 minutes, if you need it.

650
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:53,126
我会在这里，不会抽烟
l'll be here. Not smoking.

651
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:09,268
钱德
Where is she?

652
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,543
她人呢？我可不怕你

653
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:13,083
l'm not scared of you.

654
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:17,185
她不在，请进
She's not here. And please come in.

655
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:22,987
威士忌加冰和莱姆片 放在杯垫上？
Scotch on the rocks...

656
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:22,959
...with a twist, on a coaster.

657
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:24,618
摩妮卡，摩妮卡
Monica?

658
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:29,160
好吧，她来过，又走了
Okay, she was here. But she left.

659
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:30,324
她去哪里？
Where did she go?

660
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:33,562
她说她要想清楚
She said she had to think things over.

661
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:36,731
天哪，我真不敢相信 我以为…
Oh, my God. l can't believe this. l thought you were a good guy.

662
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:38,035
我以为你是个好人
Look, nothing happened.

663
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:39,871
我们又没怎样？

664
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:41,911
没怎样？没怎样？
Nothing? So you didn't tell my girlfriend you love her?

665
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:44,378
你没跟我女朋友示爱？

666
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:47,246
好吧，只有这样
Well, all right, one thing happened.

667
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:49,046
我真不敢相信 你知道你做了什么？
You know what you did? My girlfriend is thinking things over.

668
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:51,678
我的女朋友在想事情

669
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:53,848
你让我的女朋友思考
You made my girlfriend think!

670
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:57,025
我很抱歉
Well, l'm sorry.

671
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:00,789
她还需要想什么？我爱她
-What's to think about? l love her. -Well...

672
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:05,164
我愿意给她你不愿意给的东西
...l'm willing to offer her things that you aren't.

673
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:10,571
但是我愿意给 我只是故意要让她失望
l'm willing to offer her those things. l had a plan...

674
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:14,142
...to throw her off so when l offered all these things, she'd be surprised.

675
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:14,303
等真相大白，她就会很惊喜

676
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,506
那效果真的很好
lf it helps, it worked very well.

677
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,544
直到你杀出来，水泥墙
lt was working till you showed up, you big tree.

678
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:26,256
这样不公平
This isn't fair.

679
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:29,952
你曾经有机会，结果你搞砸了
You had your chance with her, and you blew it!

680
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:34,724
现在轮到我了，我不会搞砸 因为我们是天生一对
This is my chance. l won't blow it, because we are meant for each other.

681
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:37,801
而这一切只是个愚蠢的错误
And this has all just been one stupid mistake!

682
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,665
我本来打算今晚求婚的
l was gonna propose tonight.

683
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:45,971
你要求婚？
-You were gonna propose? -Yeah, l even...

684
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:47,600
对，我还…

685
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:52,280
准备了戒指，你有吗？
...got a ring. Did you get a ring?

686
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:54,010
没有，我没准备
No, l don't have a ring.

687
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:01,349
你去找她吧，钱德
You go get her, Chandler.

688
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:08,595
我可以给你一个忠告吗？ 要是你得到了她
And can l give you a piece of advice?

689
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:08,962
lf you do get her...

690
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:13,597
一定要好好把握，相信我
...don't let her go.

691
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:13,336
Trust me.

692
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,267
理查…你的确是个好人
You know, Richard, you are a good guy.

693
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:23,240
我知道

694
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:26,242
真讨厌
l hate that.

695
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:40,791
钱德
-l've gotta find Monica. -She's gone.

696
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:43,423
待会再说，我得去找摩妮卡 她走了

697
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:44,262
什么？
-What? -She had a bag and she left.

698
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:47,098
她走了，提着一个包包走了

699
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:48,136
你在说什么？
-What? -She was all crying....

700
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:51,606
她哭得很伤心 说你们要的东西不一样
She said you guys want different things.

701
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:52,835
说她需要时间思考
-Why didn't you tell her it was a plan? -l told her everything.

702
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:55,104
你为什么不拦住她？ 不说出我的打算？

703
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:58,875
我有啊，我都说了 但是她不信

704
00:41:57,314 --> 00:42:01,580
-But she wouldn't believe me. -Well, where--? Where did she go?

705
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:01,611
那她…她上哪去了？

706
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:04,620
她父母家，她叫你不要打给她
To her parents' . She said you shouldn't call. But if l were you, l would.

707
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:07,714
要是我就会打

708
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:09,622
我居然搞砸了
-l can't believe l ruined this. -l am so sorry, man.

709
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:11,490
我很遗撼

710
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,267
你希望是个惊喜的
You wanted it to be a surprise.

711
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:36,713
天哪
Oh, my God.

712
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:48,997
钱德…我这辈子…
Chandler...

713
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,398
...in all my life...

714
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:51,693
从来没想过我会这么幸运
...l never thought l would be so lucky...

715
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:58,864
可以…爱上我最要好的…
...as to fall in love with my best....

716
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:02,971
我最要好的…
My best....

717
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,447
所以说都是男人求婚嘛 好好好
There's a reason why girls don't do this!

718
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:09,644
我来，我以为…
l'll do it. l thought....

719
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:15,915
等等，我一定行
Wait, l can do this.

720
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:26,959
我以为开口的时间地点很重要
l thought that it mattered...

721
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:26,328
...what l said or where l said it.

722
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:33,704
后来才发现唯一重要的是你…
Then l realized...

723
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:32,307
...the only thing that matters is that you....

724
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:41,241
让我得到超乎想像的幸福
You make me happier than l ever thought l could be.

725
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:46,246
所以如果你愿意
And if you let me...

726
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:50,316
我愿意用下半生 让你跟我一样幸福
...l'll spend all my life trying to make you feel the same way.

727
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:01,061
摩妮卡…
Monica...

728
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:04,474
你愿意嫁给我吗？
...will you marry me?

729
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,407
我愿意
Yes.

730
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:25,118
我就知道你应该会成亲
l knew you were likely to take a wife!

731
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:31,193
可以进去了吗？我们快憋死了
Can we come in yet? We're dying out here!

732
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:33,098
进来，进来
Come in! Come in!

733
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,703
我们订婚了
We're engaged!

734
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,872
这是我最不嫉妒的时候
This is the least jealous l've ever been.

735
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:50,818
等等，不行啦，罗斯不在
Oh, no, wait! This is wrong! Ross isn't here!

736
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:56,022
他都玩三次了 知道是怎么回事
Hell, he's done it three times. He knows what it's about!
