00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:04,429
Hi, you guys.

1
00:00:04,704 --> 00:00:06,171
What's the matter?

2
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:09,375
Well, it's just... lt's one of these
situations that l just hate.

3
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:12,043
A massage client gave me three tickets...

4
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:14,906
...to the Helmut Peltz Exhibit
at the Morgan Chase Museum.

5
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:17,739
Now you're thinking
you gotta sleep with him.

6
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:22,512
No. No. lt's just that he gave me
three tickets and there are six of us.

7
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:24,916
-l'll give up my ticket.
-Me too.

8
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:27,256
Okay. That's so generous.

9
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:29,689
And l think Ross is generous too.

10
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,864
Great! Then it's just us girls.

11
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:34,532
-Great.
-Yeah.

12
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,326
So what is the exhibit?

13
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,164
lt's mostly just photographs...

14
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:45,333
...of lesbian love scenes interspersed
with video games and free sandwiches.

15
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,277
Oh, man!

16
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:56,183
-Hi.
-Hi.

17
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:57,481
Hey, Ross, listen.

18
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:01,820
Chandler got you out of going to the
lesbian sandwich museum this weekend.

19
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:08,426
Thanks, but l have plans.
Elizabeth and l are going out of town.

20
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:09,965
-That's great!
-Yeah.

21
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,400
Think about all the money
that you're gonna make.

22
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:13,606
Why? What?

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,707
Well, her father pays you
for babysitting, right?

24
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,042
That's funny.
But maybe it's time to move on.

25
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,215
You know, let it go. Stop it!

26
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:26,308
Besides, Rachel's going out
with Elizabeth's father...

27
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:29,420
...so he's much older than she is.

28
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:33,917
Looks like l'm not the only one
interested in fossils.

29
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:39,328
All that does is remind us
that you're interested in fossils.

30
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:42,328
Okay, okay.

31
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:47,529
Rachel's gonna need to yell
sweet nothings in his ear.

32
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:54,245
-Ross?
-Come on! That's funny.

33
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:57,109
Because he's gonna...
He's got, like, a hearing aid.

34
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:00,811
Because he's all old.

35
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,285
One second.

36
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:12,789
Okay, look, Ross.

37
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:16,635
Just so you know,
since Lizzie likes you so much...

38
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:19,202
...l've accepted the fact
that you're dating her.

39
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,031
Really? That's great.

40
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,476
Yeah, but then l changed my mind.

41
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:26,375
l'm funny like that.

42
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,911
So l told Lizzie, now l'm telling you.

43
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,549
l don't want you
seeing my daughter anymore.

44
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:34,048
Look, l realize it upsets you.

45
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:35,982
Yes, it does.

46
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,616
But Elizabeth and l are both adults...

47
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,660
...so l don't think there's
anything you can do about it.

48
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,731
l'll tell the university about
your relationship and have you fired.

49
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,162
Oh, a man with a plan!

50
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:57,336
The One Where Paul's The Man

53
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:34,745
This is so exciting. You can get your picture
back up on the wall of fame.

54
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,778
He's got all the big actors.

55
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,247
lt was so cool when l was up there.

56
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:42,888
Me and Jim Belushi would just be
cracking up about something.

57
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:46,554
l get fired off Days of Our Lives
and he takes me down.

58
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:49,227
Now he's just laughing at me.

59
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:53,296
Look at him.
That smug Belushi bastard!

60
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:57,826
Okay. Maybe when they put
your picture back up...

61
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,868
...they could put you by Matt Lauer.

62
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:02,506
Look at him just smiling at me.

63
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:07,375
Yeah, l know.
We'd be great together.

64
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:14,050
-So l'm back.
-Who are you?

65
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,486
Joey Tribbiani.

66
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:19,354
From the wall?

67
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:22,994
Okay, maybe this
will jog your memory.

68
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,089
Okay, anyway.

69
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:32,031
l'm ready to go back up on the wall.
l'm the star of a new TV show.

70
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:36,503
-Show me in the TV book.
-lt's not on TV yet.

71
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:39,507
Well, then it's not on the wall yet.

72
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:43,971
Okay, fine. l will bring you a tape.

73
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:48,085
So, now, do you have any
of Matt Lauer's clothes?

74
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:51,586
Maybe? Just ones that
haven't been cleaned yet?

75
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:55,054
God.

76
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:00,193
l love museums.

77
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,730
-Soaking up all the culture.
-Yeah.

78
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,665
-Where do you want to start?
-The gift shop!

79
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:09,699
-And then lunch.
-Yes, but l can't eat too much.

80
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:14,208
Paul's taking me out to dinner tonight.
He said he has a big surprise planned.

81
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:17,641
Do you think maybe
he's gonna tell you he's gay?

82
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:20,248
What? No, why?

83
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:24,115
No reason. That would just be
a really big surprise, right?

84
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:28,391
You could put the aisle over here
and have the wedding ceremony over here.

85
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,562
l didn't know you could get married here.

86
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:33,061
This would be a beautiful place
to get married.

87
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:36,861
But l wouldn't put the aisle there.
And l would never have the ceremony there.

88
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,163
You'd have the ceremony
under a beautiful arch.

89
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,264
May l help you?

90
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:44,733
Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt.
lt's just such a beautiful space.

91
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:47,378
-Do you do a lot of weddings?
-Yes, we're popular.

92
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:50,275
There's a two-year waiting list.
Sorry.

93
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,775
Monica, you should put
your name down for this place.

94
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,715
What? Are you crazy?

95
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:58,852
l'm not getting married.
l'm not even engaged.

96
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:02,421
But there's a two-year wait.
What if you get engaged in two years?

97
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,830
Then you've got to wait
another two years?

98
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:07,828
That's four years.
Chandler's not gonna wait that long.

99
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,001
He's gonna find somebody else.

100
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,602
Someone who did put their name
on the list.

101
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:16,001
lt can't hurt to put your name down.

102
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:19,905
lf, in two years, you're not engaged,
you just don't use it.

103
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:22,979
l guess there is no harm
in putting my name down.

104
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,748
l'm gonna do it too.

105
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:25,951
Me too!

106
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:30,487
-Really? Who would you marry?
-l don't have anyone right now.

107
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:31,747
Oh, Pheebs.

108
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:36,418
Don't feel too sorry for me.
At least my boyfriend isn't gay.

109
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,095
Phoebe, that's not...

110
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:42,233
Don't even get me started on yours.

111
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,571
-Did you watch the tape of my show?
-l did.

112
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,504
-Let's get me back up there.
-You don't go up on the wall.

113
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:57,840
-What? But you saw the show.
-lt was very offensive to my people.

114
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:01,445
Dry cleaners?

115
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:06,489
Russians. lt showed them
as terrorists and villains.

116
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:10,093
Okay, okay.
Look, you got Harrison Ford up there!

117
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,593
That's right.
Mr. Ford is a very good customer.

118
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:15,096
He brings us a lot of clothes.
You bring nothing!

119
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:16,866
Okay, that may be true.

120
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:21,267
But in Air Force One, okay,
the Russians were terrorists and evil!

121
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:24,908
And plus, he kills a bunch of them.
That's offensive to Russians.

122
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:28,671
-l've never seen it.
-You should. lt's great!

123
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,478
This place is really beautiful.

124
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:40,590
l've been coming here since l was
a kid. This used to be my grandma's.

125
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:44,024
The only thing l got
from my grandmother was her eyes.

126
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:47,124
l mean, not her actual eyeballs.

127
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:50,199
But people say that my eyes look....

128
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:52,026
Do you wanna make out?

129
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:53,761
Sure.

130
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:58,971
Are you okay?

131
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:00,638
What's wrong?

132
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,145
Yeah. l was just thinking
about your father.

133
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:05,975
Well, whatever works for you.

134
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,686
No.

135
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:14,420
He just really freaked me out before.

136
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,925
So we have to hide our relationship
from one more person.

137
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,188
Big deal.

138
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,525
Besides, we've had fun hiding it.

139
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:23,057
Yeah.

140
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,764
-Yeah?
-You brought protection, right?

141
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,637
Why, are there, like, bears or something?

142
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:40,975
Protection. Yeah. No, yeah.
That... That l forgot.

143
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:47,189
l can't believe l brought two cans
of bug spray and forgot that.

144
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:51,992
-l'll run to the store and get some.
-l'm the guy. l'll get it.

145
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,825
-Do you know where the store is?
-No.

146
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:58,400
Do you wanna ride around town
on my little pink bicycle?

147
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,039
A little bit.

148
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:06,640
l'll be back in 1 0 minutes. Get in
the hot tub and l'll meet you there.

149
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,180
Okay.

150
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:26,454
Oh, my God! What a great surprise!
This is such a beautiful house!

151
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:30,294
Thank you. lt used to be my mother's.
This is the kitchen.

152
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,438
-Hey, Chandler.
-Hey, Joe.

153
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:45,580
Everybody's gotta be doing something.

154
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,783
You've reached Monica and Chandler's.

155
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,788
lf you're listening to this message,
we're probably screening.

156
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:55,220
Yeah, we are.

00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:59,320
Hi, this is Hildy
from the Morgan Chase Museum.

158
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:03,558
l'm calling for Monica Geller. l wanted to
let her know that there was a cancellation.

159
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:07,796
lf she's still interested in having the
Bing-Geller wedding in our facility...

160
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,632
...it is available...

161
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,637
This is Chandler Bing!
This is Chandler Bing!

162
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:14,506
Yes, the groom.

163
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,078
No, not the groom!

164
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,214
lt's so secluded up here.

165
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,422
l know. That's why l like it here.

166
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,728
l feel like we're the only two people
in the world.

167
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:32,664
Sorry.

168
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,832
What's the matter, honey?

169
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:43,433
-Did you see a little mouse?
-No! Big bear! Big bear outside!

170
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,610
l think l....

171
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:49,440
-Actually, would you go check on that?
-We don't have any bears here.

172
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:50,876
Well, okay.

173
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,017
Would you get me a Diet Coke?

174
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:56,481
-Okay. Be right back.
-Okay.

175
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:04,285
-What are you doing here?
-What are you doing here?

176
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,556
-l came with Paul!
-Yeah. l recognized the ankles.

177
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:11,367
-Where is Elizabeth?
-She's at the store.

178
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,538
-You make the girl go to the store?
-Do l know where the store is?

179
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:17,565
Hurry up. Get out.

180
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:20,111
Here you go, honey.

181
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:23,846
-Thank you!
-Diet Coke.

182
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,073

183
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,243
l need ice.

184
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:31,211
Okay.

185
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:33,122
-Thank you.
-Be right back.

186
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,326
Okay.

187
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,092
You and your ice.

188
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:41,526
Get out! Get out! Go! Come on!

189
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,663
No, not in there! Not in there!
He's in there!

190
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,033
-Did you really hear a bear?
-Go!

191
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,113
Here you go, honey.

192
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:58,683
One Diet Coke with ice.

193
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:01,616
Thank you.

194
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:05,186
l am so happy that you're here.

195
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,119
-Here l am!
-Elizabeth!

196
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,390
Look! Elizabeth's here!

197
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,158
Who were you talking to?

198
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:16,595
You guys?

199
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:20,696
How did you know we were here?

200
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:26,037
She obviously saw the tire tracks
leading up to the closed garage.

201
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,640
Obviously.

202
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:33,679
What are you doing here?

203
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,651
Did you come up here to work on
that term paper or something?

204
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:44,985
Yeah.

205
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:48,591
Well, why don't you go in that room
and do your homework?

206
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:52,301
l wouldn't do it in there.
That's my dad's bedroom.

207
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,838
That's your dad's bedroom.

208
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,575
That's your dad's bedroom!

209
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:04,875
Why are you yelling?

210
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:08,047
That Diet Coke, l think,
just straight to my head!

211
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:15,251
Hi, honey.

212
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,621
See you later.

213
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,458
Wait. l bought groceries.
l was gonna make you dinner.

214
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,097
Well, next time, ask!

215
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,563
Or at least wait for me to ask!

216
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:41,018
Hi, this is Hildy
from the Morgan Chase Museum.

217
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:44,120
-l'm calling for Monica Geller.
-Oh, no.

218
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:47,085
l wanted to let her know
that there was a cancellation.

219
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:50,854
lf she's still interested in having
the Bing-Geller wedding in our facility...

220
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:52,256
...it is available....

221
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,159
Please. He didn't hear it!

222
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,994
This is Chandler Bing!
This is Chandler Bing!

223
00:13:58,804 --> 00:13:59,828
No!

224
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,806
Can l help you?

225
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:08,778
Yeah, where's the guy who decides
whose pictures go up on the wall?

226
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,949
-He's not here right now.
-You're kidding me!

227
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:16,348
Make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani
stopped by to drop off all these clothes.

228
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,353
l'm an actor. l'm trying to get
my picture on the wall.

229
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:23,351
You know, there are two people
who could get your picture up there.

230
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:25,388
Oh, really?

231
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,496
Well, maybe you and l go out
for drinks.

232
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,766
You're the other one, right?

233
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,505
So, Lizzie, are you planning on
staying the night?

234
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:42,278
No, no. Believe me,
l'm leaving as soon as possible.

235
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:47,343
Good. Not that we don't want you
to stay. Obviously, you're welcome.

236
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:49,679
How much more homework
do you have?

237
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,485
l just have one problem left
that l do not know how to solve.

238
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:58,026
Rachel, maybe you wanna come
upstairs and help me figure it out?

239
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,553
Really?

240
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:01,390
Okay.

241
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,797
Okay, l'll go upstairs...

242
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,735
...if you get me something
from the car.

243
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:09,907
What do you need from the car?

244
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:11,676
Surprise me.

245
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:15,146
Okay.

246
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:19,311
So you're gonna be in the car!
l will be upstairs!

247
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,610
That's where everybody's gonna be!

248
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:48,545
Just relax. Relax, Paul.
You're doing great.

249
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,881
She likes you.

250
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:53,582
l think she likes you. She likes you.

251
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,582
You know why?
Because you're a neat guy.

252
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,651
You are the man.

253
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,419
You are the man!

254
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,062
Still got it.

255
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,467
Still sexy.

256
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,735
You're just a love machine.

257
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,389
Showtime.

258
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,001
-Phoebe?
-Yeah?

259
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:44,930
-Have you seen Chandler?
-No, why?

260
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,934
The museum called and said
that there was a cancellation...

261
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:51,233
...and that we could move up our
wedding. And Chandler heard.

262
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:53,443
l know. How bad is this?

263
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:57,443
Well, with a regular guy, it's bad.
With Chandler, oh, dear God!

264
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:02,448
l know! And he totally freaked out.
l can't find him anywhere!

265
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,816
-What are you gonna do?
-l'm never going to listen to you again.

266
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:08,856
''What harm can it do
if you put your name down?''

267
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,925
-Rachel said that.
-Well, Rachel's not here!

268
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:21,602
You really think she put
your picture up already?

269
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,638
Did she put my picture up?

270
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:25,434
You kidding, after the date we had?

271
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:28,511
l wouldn't be surprised if she put
1 0 of my pictures up there.

272
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:33,242
Except for the fact that l only gave her one.
l don't know where she'd get the other nine.

273
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,487
Here it is!

274
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:40,723
Joey, why did you sign it
''son of a bitch''?

275
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:47,297
-l didn't do that. Who would do that?
-Son of a bitch!

276
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:49,757
Okay. Maybe ask this guy.

277
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,429
-You! Get out of my shop!
-What did he do?

278
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:55,765
-He went out with my wife!
-Joey!

279
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:00,301
l did not go out with your wife! Okay?

280
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,179
l went out with her.

281
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,245
That's my wife!

282
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:08,314
l'm not pointing at her, no.
l'm pointing at her.

283
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:11,420
''Zelda McMurray. ''

284
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,915
Who the hell...?
How did she get up there?!

285
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:15,150
Get out!

286
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:20,228
-Well, we should go.
-Yeah.

287
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:23,657
Ross?

288
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,168
Elizabeth!

289
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:36,646
Okay. l'm gonna go out this window.

290
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:40,450
l'll meet you at the front door.
Tell them you're going home.

291
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:43,052
-Okay.
-Wait! No, don't go in there!

292
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:46,046
Don't go in there!
l need another soda!

293
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:48,315
Ross!

294
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:53,798
Oh, my God, Ross!
What in heaven's name are you doing here?

295
00:18:56,768 --> 00:19:00,204
And that is why
we cannot see each other anymore.

296
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:06,870
Ross, you and l are gonna have
to have a little talk.

297
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,272
-Daddy, l...
-You're next!

298
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,448
Okay. l didn't know he was here.

299
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:15,582
Let me just see if l got this straight.

300
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:19,086
l tell you to stay away from
my daughter or l'll have you fired.

301
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,656
What you heard was:
''Take my daughter...

302
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,761
...come up to my country house
and ruin my weekend with Rachel. ''

303
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:29,794
-Please, Paul. Just let me explain.
-No! Let me explain! Fired!

304
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,931
Okay, fine. Fine. Have me fired.

305
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,034
But l want you to know...

306
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:43,272
...that you and l are not
all that different. l mean...

307
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:46,177
...l, too, am a ''neat guy. ''

308
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:56,885
What?

309
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:00,621
And l, too...

310
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,427
...am ''just a love machine. ''

311
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:30,126
-Let me show you the guest room.
-Okay.

312
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:44,107
l'm so sorry.
Please stop freaking out.

313
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:46,667
l'm not freaking out.

314
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:52,642
Why would l? A woman named Hildy called
and said we were getting married.

315
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:54,647
But that happens every day.

316
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:00,883
Honey, we were at
this beautiful place...

317
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:03,219
...and l just put our names down for fun.

318
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:06,192
-l mean, what's the harm in that?
-Right here.

319
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:11,428
Please don't think l was trying
to pressure you.

320
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,934
-Phoebe and Rachel thought...
-Phoebe and Rachel?

321
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:17,505
So the people that knew about
our wedding before me were you...

322
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:22,305
...Phoebe and Rachel, Hildy, and some
band called the Starlight Magic Seven...

323
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:24,606
...who are available, by the way.

324
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:28,117
lt was a mistake.

325
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,947
Please don't take this to mean
anything, because it doesn't.

326
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,818
Okay.

327
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:37,820
Really?

328
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:42,492
Yes. lf it really doesn't mean anything,
because you know l'm not ready.

329
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:43,701
l know.

330
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:45,260
l know.

331
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,162
Okay.

332
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:49,164
All right.

333
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:52,036
l'm gonna go tell Joey
that you're back.

334
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:55,045
We were really worried about you.

335
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,408
And that guy that
never delivered his burrito?

336
00:21:57,616 --> 00:22:00,016
He thought there was
some sort of connection.

337
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,748
Did she buy it?

338
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:08,381
Totally.

339
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:11,824
-So did Hildy show you the place?
-Yeah. lt's beautiful.

340
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:16,093
l can't believe
you're gonna ask Monica to marry you.

341
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,359
l know.

342
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:33,083
-Hey, Gunther.
-Take these cappuccinos to table 1 1 .

343
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:35,878
And that guy wants some biscotti.

344
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:39,481
l just actually came in
for a cup of coffee.

345
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:42,887
Do you still work here?

346
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:46,822
No. l quit a long time ago.

347
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,224
Did l forget to tell you that?
l'm sorry.

348
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:53,362
-Cool. l was gonna fire you anyway.
-Great!
