1
00:00:01,782 --> 00:00:04,979
Chandler, Mon, there's only
one muffin left.

2
00:00:05,152 --> 00:00:08,610
- I ordered mine first.
- Yeah, but I'm so much faster.

3
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,320
- Give it to me.
- No.

4
00:00:12,959 --> 00:00:14,824
Give it to me!

5
00:00:14,995 --> 00:00:17,486
Okay, you can have it.

6
00:00:24,671 --> 00:00:27,765
There you go. Enjoy your coffee.

7
00:00:28,175 --> 00:00:30,837
That was there when I got here.

8
00:00:33,246 --> 00:00:36,841
Hey, you'll never guess
who's coming to New York.

9
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,041
Tell us before he can swallow.

10
00:00:39,486 --> 00:00:42,148
Ryan, that guy I dated
who's in the Navy.

11
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,349
You dated a guy in the Navy?

12
00:00:45,525 --> 00:00:48,016
I met him while playing guitar.

13
00:00:48,228 --> 00:00:51,527
Ryan threw in saltwater taffy.
He had no change.

14
00:00:51,732 --> 00:00:55,168
Is that when you wrote
"Saltwater Taffy Man"?

15
00:00:56,737 --> 00:01:00,503
He's my submarine guy.
He resurfaces every couple years...

16
00:01:00,707 --> 00:01:03,505
...and we have an amazing
three days together.

17
00:01:03,677 --> 00:01:08,341
Only, he's coming for two weeks.
Two whole weeks, which means yea!

18
00:01:10,016 --> 00:01:14,476
So, wait, this guy goes down
for, like, two years at a time?

19
00:01:16,723 --> 00:01:19,624
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.

20
00:01:23,397 --> 00:01:24,887
Hi.

21
00:01:25,632 --> 00:01:29,500
- Oh, no. What happened?
- Ben's got the chickenpox.

22
00:01:30,904 --> 00:01:34,237
So if you haven't had it,
chances are you will.

23
00:01:34,441 --> 00:01:36,170
- I've had it.
- I've had it.

24
00:01:36,376 --> 00:01:37,365
Had it.

25
00:01:37,544 --> 00:01:41,310
I've never had it. I feel so left out.
Oh, look!

26
00:01:44,584 --> 00:01:46,711
The One With the Chicken Pox

27
00:02:34,434 --> 00:02:37,164
Honey, you made the bed again.

28
00:02:37,337 --> 00:02:40,670
You don't have to do that.
This isn't camp.

29
00:02:40,841 --> 00:02:44,971
I guess the panty raid last night
was totally uncalled for.

30
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:51,178
Okay, I'm taking a shower. Today
I'll sing Jim Croce's "Leroy Brown."

31
00:03:03,363 --> 00:03:05,729
Hey, Mon, I have a question.

32
00:03:05,932 --> 00:03:09,163
Is Leroy the baddest man
in the whole damn town...

33
00:03:09,336 --> 00:03:11,998
...or the fattest man?

34
00:03:12,172 --> 00:03:16,233
The baddest. Or the song
would be "Fat, Fat Leroy Brown."

35
00:03:17,077 --> 00:03:19,238
What are you doing?

36
00:03:19,946 --> 00:03:22,915
I'm just waiting for you, sweetie.

37
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:27,411
Are you remaking the bed?

38
00:03:28,054 --> 00:03:31,353
I'm sorry. The way you did it,
it was just fine.

39
00:03:31,558 --> 00:03:33,992
Then you're redoing it because?

40
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,889
You'll think I'm crazy.

41
00:03:36,062 --> 00:03:39,463
You're pretty much
running that risk either way.

42
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,995
Okay. You see...

43
00:03:43,303 --> 00:03:46,966
...the duvet tag shouldn't be
at the top left corner...

44
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,836
...it should be
at the bottom right corner.

45
00:03:50,043 --> 00:03:52,443
- It's not crazy.
- I'm easing you in.

46
00:03:53,413 --> 00:03:54,505
All right.

47
00:03:55,081 --> 00:03:59,541
You see these flower blossoms?
They should be facing up, not down...

48
00:03:59,753 --> 00:04:03,917
...because the head of the bed
is where the sun would be.

49
00:04:07,193 --> 00:04:09,957
You don't love me anymore, do you?

50
00:04:11,331 --> 00:04:14,391
Actually, if it's possible,
I love you more.

51
00:04:15,135 --> 00:04:16,727
Really?

52
00:04:17,971 --> 00:04:20,132
Wow. Well, then, come on!

53
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,538
I wanna show you how to fold
the toilet paper into a point.

54
00:04:27,914 --> 00:04:29,973
Look, if you need something...

55
00:04:30,183 --> 00:04:32,981
...I can get you a job here
as a processor.

56
00:04:33,153 --> 00:04:36,748
- Don't you need experience?
- It's not hard to learn.

57
00:04:36,923 --> 00:04:40,723
As far as not knowing
what you're doing, you're an actor.

58
00:04:40,927 --> 00:04:45,387
Act like a processor,
people will think you're a processor.

59
00:04:45,565 --> 00:04:48,056
Here's this morning's projections.

60
00:04:48,234 --> 00:04:50,794
Thanks.
Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbiani.

61
00:04:51,338 --> 00:04:53,932
Joey is a fellow processor.

62
00:04:54,574 --> 00:04:55,734
No kidding?

63
00:04:57,444 --> 00:04:59,241
Yeah.

64
00:04:59,613 --> 00:05:04,641
I process. People want the processing,
I'm the one they call.

65
00:05:04,818 --> 00:05:08,083
- Where do you work?
- Well, I'm in between things.

66
00:05:08,421 --> 00:05:11,720
You know, one day
you're processing, the next day...

67
00:05:11,925 --> 00:05:14,120
...not so much processing anymore.

68
00:05:14,828 --> 00:05:17,353
I told Joey about Fleischman's group.

69
00:05:17,564 --> 00:05:19,122
Fleischman's group?

70
00:05:19,332 --> 00:05:23,098
Whatever you do,
don't touch his sandwiches.

71
00:05:25,705 --> 00:05:27,866
Are all you processors dorks?

72
00:05:33,913 --> 00:05:36,473
This lipstick looks just great on you.

73
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:39,251
You look fabulous, really.

74
00:05:39,552 --> 00:05:42,146
Yeah, are you sure? Really?

75
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,990
See, you look beautiful.
For God's sakes, dim the lights.

76
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:51,153
I'm hideous!

77
00:05:51,331 --> 00:05:52,798
It's gonna be okay.

78
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:54,490
Ryan's been underwater.

79
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:59,195
He's just gonna be so glad
you don't have barnacles on your butt.

80
00:06:10,984 --> 00:06:12,679
Come in.

81
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,853
Hey, baby, I'm back...

82
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:17,512
Hey, Ryan. What's up?

83
00:06:19,793 --> 00:06:23,820
- What's going on?
- No, no. You have to stay back.

84
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,429
I have the pox!

85
00:06:28,168 --> 00:06:30,500
Chicken or small?

86
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:34,834
Chicken, which is so ironic
considering I'm a vegetarian.

87
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:39,203
- Why aren't you at home?
- My grandma's never had it.

88
00:06:39,612 --> 00:06:44,879
Please tell me you have, because
oh, my God, I forgot how cute you are.

89
00:06:45,085 --> 00:06:47,383
I'm sorry, I never had them.

90
00:06:49,622 --> 00:06:53,149
If I had one wish,
I'd go back to when I was 7...

91
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:58,092
...when Jimmy Hauser had chickenpox,
and I'd rub him all over my face.

92
00:06:58,264 --> 00:07:01,756
Yeah, or you could wish
that I didn't have them now.

93
00:07:02,135 --> 00:07:03,534
Can I see your face?

94
00:07:03,703 --> 00:07:06,570
You don't wanna see a face
covered with pox.

95
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,971
It could be covered with lox,
I wouldn't care.

96
00:07:10,477 --> 00:07:11,967
And you hate fish.

97
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,877
So sweet. All right.

98
00:07:16,049 --> 00:07:18,244
Okay, all right. You can see.

99
00:07:19,185 --> 00:07:20,982
This is me.

100
00:07:26,126 --> 00:07:27,650
Sorry!

101
00:07:27,827 --> 00:07:29,226
I am scary!

102
00:07:29,395 --> 00:07:33,491
Sorry, the lightning was
an unfortunate coincidence.

103
00:07:34,067 --> 00:07:37,434
- You look lovely! Lovely!
- I hate this.

104
00:07:37,971 --> 00:07:41,168
I had the most amazing
two weeks planned for us.

105
00:07:41,374 --> 00:07:45,743
And everything I had in mind,
we had to be closer than this.

106
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:51,278
Phoebe, I've spent the last eight
months in a steel tube with men...

107
00:07:52,018 --> 00:07:54,612
...thinking about this moment.

108
00:07:54,821 --> 00:07:57,221
I am not gonna let a bunch...

109
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,688
...of itchy spots stand between us.

110
00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:10,629
Okay. This is the most
romantic disease I've ever had.

111
00:08:17,377 --> 00:08:20,005
- How's the first day?
- It's like you said.

112
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,514
It's mostly just putting numbers
from one column into another.

113
00:08:24,684 --> 00:08:29,280
Everybody's so nice. I just had
a good talk with that lady, Jeannie.

114
00:08:29,722 --> 00:08:33,158
Jeannie? The head
of East Coast operations?

115
00:08:33,326 --> 00:08:36,056
Turns out our kids
go to the same school.

116
00:08:39,065 --> 00:08:41,226
Yeah. Small world, huh?

117
00:08:42,202 --> 00:08:44,067
Weird world.

118
00:08:44,504 --> 00:08:48,804
- Your kids?
- I figure my character has kids.

119
00:08:49,676 --> 00:08:53,942
There isn't a part of that sentence
I don't need explained.

120
00:08:54,113 --> 00:08:57,105
In acting, you need
to think about that stuff.

121
00:08:57,317 --> 00:09:00,616
My character, Joseph,
the processing guy...

122
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,483
...has two little girls,
Ashley and Brittany.

123
00:09:05,725 --> 00:09:09,092
Ashley copies everything
Brittany does.

124
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,831
Well, invisible kids
can be that way sometimes.

125
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:22,701
You know, Joseph and his wife, Karen,
are thinking of having a third kid.

126
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:24,909
You know what?

127
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:26,942
Just did.

128
00:09:27,714 --> 00:09:32,845
Wow, that's some pretty powerful
imaginary sperm you must have there.

129
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:49,134
- Know what makes the itching worse?
- That you don't stop talking about it?

130
00:09:49,869 --> 00:09:52,167
- Fine.
- Let's just play, okay?

131
00:09:52,872 --> 00:09:56,433
Good, okay. Here we go, double sixes.

132
00:09:56,609 --> 00:09:58,736
Here we go...

133
00:10:00,046 --> 00:10:04,813
Here we go. Come to Mama. Just getting
ready to roll the dice...

134
00:10:05,018 --> 00:10:10,183
- What're you doing? Are you scratching?
- No. This is what I do for luck, okay?

135
00:10:11,324 --> 00:10:14,088
- You're scratching. Give me the dice.
- No.

136
00:10:14,294 --> 00:10:16,854
- Give me the dice.
- No! Here. There!

137
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,520
Look, double sixes!

138
00:10:20,099 --> 00:10:22,363
We can't scratch. We'll scar.

139
00:10:22,835 --> 00:10:26,532
I can't stop thinking about it.
It's just so hard.

140
00:10:26,773 --> 00:10:30,072
I wanna grab these houses
and rub them on my body.

141
00:10:30,343 --> 00:10:33,335
- No!
- Give it! Yeah, come on!

142
00:10:33,546 --> 00:10:36,276
You know you want it too.
Come on.

143
00:10:36,482 --> 00:10:38,973
Let's just be bad.
It'll feel so good.

144
00:10:39,185 --> 00:10:40,652
Come on.

145
00:10:41,955 --> 00:10:43,786
Oh, God help me.

146
00:10:45,692 --> 00:10:47,660
- Oh, yeah.
- Good. Now do me.

147
00:10:47,827 --> 00:10:50,694
Do my back.
Oh, come on. Harder!

148
00:10:50,897 --> 00:10:52,956
- There you go. Don't move.
- Why?

149
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,930
- Don't move.
- What are you?

150
00:10:59,305 --> 00:11:01,899
Stop that! Stop that right now.

151
00:11:02,075 --> 00:11:07,672
I might've expected this of Phoebe.
But, Ryan, you're a military man.

152
00:11:09,115 --> 00:11:11,049
She made me do it.

153
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,150
That's a nice color on you.

154
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:16,618
Yeah, well, it comes in pink
and blotchy, baby.

155
00:11:17,023 --> 00:11:19,890
I hope you get a weenie pock.

156
00:11:23,162 --> 00:11:26,859
You and Milton have to join us
on the boat.

157
00:11:27,033 --> 00:11:31,436
- We'll make a day of it.
- That sounds lovely. We'll set it up.

158
00:11:31,604 --> 00:11:34,767
I better get back.
Hope the baby feels better.

159
00:11:34,941 --> 00:11:38,604
- Thanks. Bye-bye, Jeannie.
- Bye-bye, Joseph.

160
00:11:39,345 --> 00:11:40,869
What a phony.

161
00:11:43,783 --> 00:11:48,584
You'll teach her a lesson when she
steps off the dock onto nothing.

162
00:11:48,921 --> 00:11:50,650
- Hey, Mr. Douglas.
- Sir.

163
00:11:50,857 --> 00:11:55,260
Bing, I got your memo. We won't
see the report till next Friday?

164
00:11:55,428 --> 00:12:01,128
- My group wants the weekend for family.
- I have a family. I'm gonna be here.

165
00:12:01,334 --> 00:12:04,826
Yeah, Bing. What's that about?

166
00:12:08,474 --> 00:12:11,500
It's about cutting people
slack for morale.

167
00:12:11,811 --> 00:12:14,609
I can get some rough numbers
by Wednesday.

168
00:12:14,781 --> 00:12:17,045
Rough numbers?

169
00:12:17,917 --> 00:12:22,047
This company wasn't built
on rough numbers. Right, Mr. Douglas?

170
00:12:22,522 --> 00:12:25,457
Have the final numbers
on my desk by Tuesday.

171
00:12:25,658 --> 00:12:28,149
If you say so, sir.

172
00:12:28,561 --> 00:12:31,086
Joseph's good, isn't he?

173
00:12:32,698 --> 00:12:34,359
I'm going to kill you.

174
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:39,904
Hey, I figure Joseph's the kind of guy
who likes to mix it up.

175
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:43,370
You know, get in there,
ruffle some feathers.

176
00:12:44,577 --> 00:12:45,976
Why?

177
00:12:47,747 --> 00:12:51,376
Look, I'm sorry,
but that's what Joseph does.

178
00:12:51,584 --> 00:12:55,918
Okay? If you try to pull something,
he'll call you on it.

179
00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:58,717
"What're you trying to pull?"
He'll say.

180
00:13:03,496 --> 00:13:04,895
Duct tape.

181
00:13:05,498 --> 00:13:08,433
Was I supposed to bring something too?

182
00:13:08,868 --> 00:13:13,430
This is for the scratchy twins.
I taped oven mitts to their hands.

183
00:13:13,906 --> 00:13:17,433
- You're strict.
- Well, it's for their own good.

184
00:13:17,677 --> 00:13:22,410
You know, I like the way you have
efficiently folded this tab under.

185
00:13:22,615 --> 00:13:27,814
See, in a tape emergency you could
shave valuable seconds off your time.

186
00:13:28,254 --> 00:13:30,017
Exactly!

187
00:13:30,556 --> 00:13:34,959
God, I love that I can be
totally neurotic around you now.

188
00:13:35,228 --> 00:13:39,756
Don't you like it better with
everything on your desk perpendicular?

189
00:13:39,932 --> 00:13:43,129
If it's not a right angle,
it is a wrong angle.

190
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,265
- Very good.
- Thank you.

191
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:48,839
Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.

192
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:52,568
- You're gonna do what to them?
- Set them to my time.

193
00:13:55,148 --> 00:13:58,709
I'm confused.
I thought we shared time.

194
00:13:59,585 --> 00:14:05,046
No. See, in my bedroom, I set my clock
six minutes fast. Know why?

195
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:09,728
Because it's in a slightly different
time zone than the kitchen?

196
00:14:09,996 --> 00:14:12,487
- Forget it.
- No, come on, tell me.

197
00:14:12,765 --> 00:14:16,792
You don't understand. You don't
have any of these obsessions.

198
00:14:17,003 --> 00:14:18,834
No, that's not true.

199
00:14:19,071 --> 00:14:21,130
Oh, yeah? Tell me one of yours.

200
00:14:22,108 --> 00:14:23,666
Okay.

201
00:14:28,147 --> 00:14:32,675
One of my things is,
I always separate my sweat socks...

202
00:14:32,952 --> 00:14:35,944
...from my dress socks.

203
00:14:38,391 --> 00:14:42,828
- What if they get mixed up?
- Boy, I would just...

204
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:45,156
I would freak out.

205
00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:47,966
You would not.

206
00:14:48,201 --> 00:14:51,796
I can't believe this.
I hate this. You're too normal.

207
00:14:52,004 --> 00:14:56,873
I can't believe you don't have a thing.
My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.

208
00:14:57,043 --> 00:15:01,241
See, if anyone overheard that,
I didn't come off well there.

209
00:15:06,686 --> 00:15:08,085
Hey!

210
00:15:09,522 --> 00:15:14,357
- Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
- Why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?

211
00:15:15,161 --> 00:15:19,291
He has a suspicion you dropped
the ball on the Lender project.

212
00:15:19,498 --> 00:15:22,058
Why? Why does he suspect that?

213
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:28,163
At first, he thought it was Joseph.
But after he asked Joseph about it...

214
00:15:28,341 --> 00:15:30,468
Turns out it was you.

215
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:34,746
- I thought you should know.
- All right. That's it!

216
00:15:34,981 --> 00:15:39,350
Look, Joey, I realize this
is the role of a lifetime for you...

217
00:15:39,518 --> 00:15:43,818
...and if I could just fire Joseph,
I would. But that's not possible.

218
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:46,754
So I'm gonna have to let
both of you go.

219
00:15:47,727 --> 00:15:51,993
- What? Everybody loves Joseph.
- I don't. I hate Joseph.

220
00:15:52,865 --> 00:15:55,493
I think he's a brownnosing suck-up.

221
00:15:56,736 --> 00:16:01,264
Oh, yeah? Well, you can't fire Joseph.
He's not in your department.

222
00:16:06,379 --> 00:16:09,746
All right, okay.
So I can't fire Joseph...

223
00:16:10,249 --> 00:16:12,740
...but I can sleep with his wife.

224
00:16:15,254 --> 00:16:16,278
Not Karen!

225
00:16:16,455 --> 00:16:19,913
Yeah, I'm thinking about
having an affair with her.

226
00:16:20,092 --> 00:16:21,957
You know what?

227
00:16:22,128 --> 00:16:23,755
I just did.

228
00:16:26,565 --> 00:16:29,796
- What the hell are you doing?
- Oh, it's not me.

229
00:16:30,036 --> 00:16:31,867
It's my character!

230
00:16:32,271 --> 00:16:33,829
Chandie.

231
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,041
The rogue processor who seduces
his coworkers' wives...

232
00:16:38,244 --> 00:16:40,109
...and then laughs about it.

233
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:43,837
I have her panties
right there in my drawer!

234
00:16:44,016 --> 00:16:46,541
- Really?
- No, freak! She's fictional!

235
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:49,210
All right. Hey, take it easy.

236
00:16:49,722 --> 00:16:54,091
If it means that much to you,
I'll go find something else.

237
00:16:55,127 --> 00:16:56,651
Thank you.

238
00:16:58,331 --> 00:17:02,324
It's just that I'm gonna miss Joseph.

239
00:17:02,535 --> 00:17:04,662
I liked him. His wife?

240
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,961
She was hot.

241
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:12,736
And the kids. You know he was gonna
put in a pool next summer.

242
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:19,143
Take these off.
I swear I won't scratch.

243
00:17:19,452 --> 00:17:21,784
No, sorry, hon. Monica's orders.

244
00:17:23,723 --> 00:17:26,214
Well, that wasn't easy.

245
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:29,425
Okay, dinner's on.

246
00:17:29,762 --> 00:17:32,162
There's a peach cobbler
in the oven.

247
00:17:32,331 --> 00:17:37,030
So the plate's gonna be hot, but that
shouldn't be a problem for you.

248
00:17:37,903 --> 00:17:39,928
All right, you kids. Bye, now.

249
00:17:40,106 --> 00:17:42,040
- Bye.
- Oh, look.

250
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,073
A low-budget puppet show.

251
00:17:46,212 --> 00:17:49,943
It's a shame you can't see
what finger I'm holding up.

252
00:17:53,719 --> 00:17:56,415
- Wine?
- Please.

253
00:18:05,831 --> 00:18:08,561
- Spilled some.
- I got it.

254
00:18:19,812 --> 00:18:22,474
I must say,
you look beautiful tonight.

255
00:18:22,648 --> 00:18:24,115
What?

256
00:18:25,418 --> 00:18:26,817
Sorry.

257
00:18:29,455 --> 00:18:31,184
You look beautiful.

258
00:18:47,473 --> 00:18:50,306
Okay. You know what? That's it.

259
00:18:58,217 --> 00:18:59,616
Oh, yes.

260
00:19:01,454 --> 00:19:02,853
Good.

261
00:19:07,893 --> 00:19:09,292
You guys, did you...?

262
00:19:19,138 --> 00:19:21,299
Monica, wake up.

263
00:19:22,608 --> 00:19:25,406
- What's up?
- I thought of a thing.

264
00:19:29,949 --> 00:19:32,144
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

265
00:19:32,451 --> 00:19:37,047
I have to sleep, have to,
on this side of the bed.

266
00:19:38,524 --> 00:19:41,823
No. You have to sleep
on this side of the bed...

267
00:19:42,027 --> 00:19:45,963
...because I have to sleep
on this side of the bed.

268
00:19:46,632 --> 00:19:50,033
Or so I would have you believe.

269
00:19:52,438 --> 00:19:56,568
So you have a side of the bed.
Everybody has a side of the bed.

270
00:19:56,775 --> 00:19:59,471
Come on. You haven't
heard my reason yet.

271
00:19:59,879 --> 00:20:02,780
- All right, go on.
- Okay.

272
00:20:02,982 --> 00:20:05,576
I have to sleep on the west side...

273
00:20:05,784 --> 00:20:10,778
...because I grew up in California,
and otherwise...

274
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:14,391
...the ocean would be
on the wrong side.

275
00:20:18,964 --> 00:20:20,363
Oh, my God.

276
00:20:20,566 --> 00:20:23,399
- You're a freak!
- Yeah.

277
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:25,469
How about that?

278
00:20:29,441 --> 00:20:32,569
- Where are you shipping off to?
- I can't say.

279
00:20:32,745 --> 00:20:36,875
- Do you have nuclear weapons onboard?
- I can't say.

280
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:39,882
Do you get to look
through a periscope?

281
00:20:40,052 --> 00:20:41,986
I'm sorry, but I can't say.

282
00:20:42,154 --> 00:20:45,123
Wow, it's neat learning
about submarines.

283
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,783
- I better get out of here.
- I'll walk you out.

284
00:20:48,961 --> 00:20:52,260
- Bye, Ryan.
- A pleasure. Take care.

285
00:20:57,069 --> 00:21:02,336
So do you think we could get you
one of those uniform things?

286
00:21:02,775 --> 00:21:05,801
- You like that, do you?
- Oh, yeah.

287
00:21:06,045 --> 00:21:09,173
- I'll make some calls.
- Okay.

288
00:21:09,848 --> 00:21:14,444
- Can you believe how we spent our time?
- We didn't do anything I planned...

289
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:19,284
...like having a picnic in Central Park
and coffee at Central Perk.

290
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,858
Oh, I just got that!

291
00:21:30,336 --> 00:21:31,735
Taxi!

292
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:39,334
Bye, you.

293
00:21:52,358 --> 00:21:53,882
I'm sorry, we're clo...

294
00:21:57,196 --> 00:22:00,222
- Hey, sailor.
- Is this what you had in mind?

295
00:22:01,967 --> 00:22:03,434
I'll say.

296
00:22:08,907 --> 00:22:11,137
I'm shipping out tomorrow.

297
00:22:11,343 --> 00:22:12,742
Well, then...

298
00:22:14,813 --> 00:22:17,680
...we better make this night count.

299
00:22:19,251 --> 00:22:22,482
Wait, I forgot to turn off
the cappuccino machine.

300
00:22:30,796 --> 00:22:32,991
Anchors aweigh.

301
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:37,295
Oh, wait, wait!
My purse, my purse!

302
00:22:43,308 --> 00:22:45,742
Oh, I forgot to turn off the light.

303
00:22:45,944 --> 00:22:49,004
Why don't I just meet you upstairs?

304
00:22:53,085 --> 00:22:54,950
Honey!

305
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,050
