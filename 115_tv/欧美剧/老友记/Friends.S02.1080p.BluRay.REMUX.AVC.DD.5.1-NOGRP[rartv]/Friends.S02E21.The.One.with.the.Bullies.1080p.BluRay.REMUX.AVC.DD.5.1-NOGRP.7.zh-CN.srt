1
00:00:02,249 --> 00:00:04,240
Stocks and bonds are moving higher....

2
00:00:04,518 --> 00:00:06,850
Why are we watching
the Business Channel?

3
00:00:07,254 --> 00:00:11,987
Because the other day l saw there was
a stock with my initials, MEG, on it.

4
00:00:12,326 --> 00:00:14,954
Sometimes it takes two or three hours
before it comes up again.

5
00:00:15,262 --> 00:00:17,127
But when it does, it's exciting.

6
00:00:18,665 --> 00:00:21,259
Okay, honey, you really need a job.

7
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:25,065
Dad says he knows someone
you can call for an interview.

8
00:00:25,372 --> 00:00:28,933
Right there! That's the third
sign today. Right there.

9
00:00:30,177 --> 00:00:33,340
On behalf of everyone,
l'd just like to say, ''Huh?''

10
00:00:34,214 --> 00:00:37,479
No, you just said ''dad.''
And everywhere l go today...

11
00:00:37,751 --> 00:00:40,219
...l keep getting signs
telling me to go see my father.

12
00:00:40,554 --> 00:00:43,717
Like when l was walking over here
and l passed a buffet.

13
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:48,125
Which is my father's last name.

14
00:00:49,363 --> 00:00:51,092
And they were serving franks...

15
00:00:51,398 --> 00:00:54,265
...which is his first name
minus the ''s'' at the end.

16
00:00:55,669 --> 00:00:59,435
And there was a rotisserie
with a spinning chicken.

17
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,605
His lndian name?

18
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,909
No. Because l chickened out
the last time...

19
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:11,139
...when l tried to meet him.
So coincidences? l don't think so.

20
00:01:11,452 --> 00:01:13,579
-Very freaky.
-Eerie.

21
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:15,582
Who wants the last hamburger?

22
00:01:15,923 --> 00:01:17,948
That's it.
Now l have to go see him.

23
00:01:18,459 --> 00:01:19,255
Why?

24
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,051
Hamburger? McDonald's?

25
00:01:22,796 --> 00:01:25,663
Old McDonald had a farm.
My dad is a pharmacist.

26
00:01:28,068 --> 00:01:29,933
The One With the Bullies

28
00:02:15,249 --> 00:02:17,274
Man, l am so beat.

29
00:02:18,418 --> 00:02:20,443
You wanna forget racquetball
and hang out?

30
00:02:20,787 --> 00:02:22,118
Yeah, all right.

31
00:02:25,492 --> 00:02:28,689
-Hey, you're in our seats.
-Sorry, we didn't know.

32
00:02:28,996 --> 00:02:30,463
We were sitting there.

33
00:02:31,098 --> 00:02:33,828
Okay.
There is one more way to say it.

34
00:02:34,134 --> 00:02:35,624
Who knows it?

35
00:02:37,371 --> 00:02:41,671
-Was that supposed to be funny?
-Actually, l was going for colorful.

36
00:02:42,142 --> 00:02:44,303
-What's with this guy?
-What's with you?

37
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:46,602
Nothing. Nothing's with him.

38
00:02:46,914 --> 00:02:48,313
Enjoy your coffee.

39
00:02:55,355 --> 00:02:56,845
What just happened?

40
00:02:58,425 --> 00:03:01,690
l just took your hat.
See, l can be funny too.

41
00:03:02,029 --> 00:03:04,862
My joke is that l took your hat.

42
00:03:05,165 --> 00:03:07,224
That is funny.

43
00:03:08,435 --> 00:03:09,402
Can l have it back?

44
00:03:18,045 --> 00:03:20,741
You know what?
l think you're very funny.

45
00:03:21,048 --> 00:03:23,539
lKudos on that hat joke.

46
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:28,786
But come on, guys,
just give him back the hat.

47
00:03:29,523 --> 00:03:30,353
Why should we?

48
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,559
Because it's a special hat.

49
00:03:34,761 --> 00:03:37,457
He bought it because
he was feeling down one day.

50
00:03:37,764 --> 00:03:38,924
So he got the hat...

51
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:41,494
...to cheer himself up, you know?

52
00:03:42,135 --> 00:03:45,263
-Chandler--
-Stop talking. Stop talking now.

53
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,370
Let me get this straight.
You're stealing my hat?

54
00:03:49,776 --> 00:03:50,606
You got a problem?

55
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:53,707
l just want to make sure
we're on the same page.

56
00:03:56,717 --> 00:03:58,344
How'd the interview go?

57
00:03:58,819 --> 00:03:59,786
lt bit.

58
00:04:01,255 --> 00:04:03,120
lt was a '50s theme restaurant.

59
00:04:03,557 --> 00:04:06,924
l'd have to cook in a costume
and dance on the counter.

60
00:04:07,361 --> 00:04:09,852
l was a sous chef
at CafÃ© des Artistes.

61
00:04:10,163 --> 00:04:14,031
How can l take a job where l have
to make Laverne-and-Curly Fries?

62
00:04:14,735 --> 00:04:16,532
-Don't do it.
-How can l not do it?

63
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,531
l have $1 27 in the bank!

64
00:04:18,905 --> 00:04:21,738
Monica, relax. Go get a beer.

65
00:04:22,075 --> 00:04:23,269
l don't want a beer.

66
00:04:23,543 --> 00:04:24,908
Who said it was for you?

67
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,914
What's the matter?

68
00:04:35,255 --> 00:04:38,281
Some mean guys at the coffeehouse
took my hat.

69
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:40,251
-No!
-You're kidding?

70
00:04:40,594 --> 00:04:42,960
lt was ridiculous.
These guys were bullies.

71
00:04:43,263 --> 00:04:45,128
Actual bullies.

72
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:49,233
We're grownups. This kind of stuff
isn't supposed to happen anymore.

73
00:04:52,372 --> 00:04:54,840
Oh, no, wait a minute.
l have no one.

74
00:04:58,745 --> 00:05:01,179
Let's go down there
and get your hat back.

75
00:05:01,581 --> 00:05:05,574
Forget it. lt's probably stripped
and sold for parts by now.

76
00:05:08,055 --> 00:05:09,716
-l went up!
-What?

77
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:13,218
My stock, MEG, it went up two points.

78
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,656
Do you realize that if l'd invested
my $1 27 in myself yesterday...

79
00:05:17,898 --> 00:05:21,561
...that l'd, like, have
a lot more than that today.

80
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:24,630
You know what?
l'm going to do it.

81
00:05:25,706 --> 00:05:27,799
-Do what?
-Put all my money in me.

82
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:30,838
You don't know a thing
about the stock market.

83
00:05:31,178 --> 00:05:34,204
What's to know?
Buy, sell. High, low. Bears, bulls.

84
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:35,641
Yes, Manhattan.

85
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,643
Telephone number for the stock...

86
00:05:39,252 --> 00:05:40,913
...selling store.

87
00:05:51,498 --> 00:05:54,228
See? l told you these pillows
would be a good idea.

88
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:55,990
Oh, God.

89
00:05:57,003 --> 00:05:58,061
Here we go.

90
00:05:59,306 --> 00:06:02,798
For the first time in my life,
l'm gonna say, ''Hi, Birth Father!''

91
00:06:03,844 --> 00:06:05,368
-We love you. We're here for you.
-Good luck.

92
00:06:05,746 --> 00:06:06,804
Thanks.

93
00:06:10,817 --> 00:06:13,081
Hey, Rach, you want some sandwich?

94
00:06:13,453 --> 00:06:14,886
What is in that?

95
00:06:15,188 --> 00:06:17,247
Olive loaf and ham spread. No mayo.

96
00:06:17,591 --> 00:06:20,355
No, because mayo,
that would make it gross.

97
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:27,032
-Run, Phoebe, run!
-No, no, doggy, please!

98
00:06:27,334 --> 00:06:30,826
l do so want to love all animals.
Please, no. Back off!

99
00:06:31,204 --> 00:06:33,172
-You got a bone?
-Are you kidding?

100
00:06:33,473 --> 00:06:35,566
Look, kibbles! Bits!

101
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:39,738
Get the hell off my leg,
you yippity piece of crap!

102
00:06:46,987 --> 00:06:49,285
Okay. All right. We have a problem.

103
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,390
Why don't you take his trampoline?

104
00:06:53,093 --> 00:06:54,958
Okay, here, l know what we can do.

105
00:06:57,464 --> 00:07:00,399
Okay, doggy, get the sandwich!

106
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:04,403
Go get the sandwich!
Good doggy. Get the sandwich!

107
00:07:05,138 --> 00:07:08,630
The dog will lick himself
but he will not touch your sandwich.

108
00:07:09,075 --> 00:07:10,406
What does that tell you?

109
00:07:11,411 --> 00:07:15,040
-lf he's not going to eat it, l will.
-Are you crazy?

110
00:07:15,348 --> 00:07:16,906
He's just a little dog.

111
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,315
-Hey.
-What?

112
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:28,955
Do you have to be a Century 21
real-estate agent...

113
00:07:29,262 --> 00:07:31,492
...to get to wear those cool jackets?

114
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,294
Do you say this stuff to girls?

115
00:07:39,105 --> 00:07:42,097
lsn't that the guy
who used to wear your hat?

116
00:07:42,442 --> 00:07:44,171
And look where they're sitting.

117
00:07:47,247 --> 00:07:51,479
You're joking, right?
You guys just walked through the door.

118
00:07:51,852 --> 00:07:53,945
Maybe we didn't make it clear enough.

119
00:07:54,287 --> 00:07:56,812
This couch belongs to us.

120
00:07:57,157 --> 00:08:00,149
l'll tell you what,
you call the couch...

121
00:08:00,861 --> 00:08:03,091
...and then we'll call the couch...

122
00:08:04,831 --> 00:08:07,095
...and we'll see who it comes to.

123
00:08:08,034 --> 00:08:11,629
You know, l keep wondering
why you two are still sitting here.

124
00:08:11,972 --> 00:08:13,200
All right, that's it.

125
00:08:14,207 --> 00:08:15,834
l have had enough of this.

126
00:08:16,476 --> 00:08:17,340
Gunther.

127
00:08:18,912 --> 00:08:21,506
These guys are trying
to take our seat.

128
00:08:22,816 --> 00:08:24,943
Fellas, these guys were here first.

129
00:08:25,318 --> 00:08:27,047
Oh, sorry, didn't realize.

130
00:08:27,554 --> 00:08:28,486
There you go.

131
00:08:28,788 --> 00:08:30,653
Thank you, Gunther.

132
00:08:33,793 --> 00:08:36,353
We didn't want to have
to go and do that.

133
00:08:37,063 --> 00:08:39,031
He told on us?

134
00:08:39,633 --> 00:08:40,725
You told on us?

135
00:08:41,067 --> 00:08:44,230
Well, pal, you didn't
give me much of a choice.

136
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,000
-Don't play with his thing.
-l know.

137
00:08:50,477 --> 00:08:51,341
All right.

138
00:08:52,345 --> 00:08:54,006
Let's take this outside.

139
00:08:56,516 --> 00:08:59,644
''Let's take this outside?''

140
00:09:02,188 --> 00:09:04,281
Who talks like that?

141
00:09:04,658 --> 00:09:08,890
The guy who's about to kick your ass
talks like that.

142
00:09:09,296 --> 00:09:10,763
You had to ask.

143
00:09:14,601 --> 00:09:16,831
Okay, okay, look. See...

144
00:09:17,203 --> 00:09:21,071
...the thing is, we're not gonna
fight you guys.

145
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,467
Here's the deal.

146
00:09:23,777 --> 00:09:28,612
You won't have to, so long as you
never ever show your faces here again.

147
00:09:34,187 --> 00:09:36,815
l think you played
the Gunther card too soon.

148
00:09:43,263 --> 00:09:45,424
Hey, Pheebs, l think you're good to go.

149
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,292
Yeah, l don't know.

150
00:09:49,402 --> 00:09:50,426
What's the matter?

151
00:09:50,737 --> 00:09:53,467
l just think that this was
a really bad sign.

152
00:09:53,807 --> 00:09:56,742
Like the beast at the threshold.

153
00:09:58,311 --> 00:10:03,044
lt's just l have no family left,
except for my grandmother.

154
00:10:03,383 --> 00:10:06,250
But let's face it, she's not
gonna be around forever.

155
00:10:06,586 --> 00:10:07,917
Despite what she says.

156
00:10:09,689 --> 00:10:14,524
And l have a sister who l've barely
spoken to since we shared a womb.

157
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:17,963
l don't know. This is my real father...

158
00:10:18,264 --> 00:10:21,495
...and l want things to be,
like, just right.

159
00:10:21,835 --> 00:10:23,325
l completely understand.

160
00:10:23,703 --> 00:10:24,727
Whatever you need.

161
00:10:26,406 --> 00:10:28,067
Hey, you want to go home?

162
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:30,568
Okay, thanks. Sorry, again.

163
00:10:50,096 --> 00:10:51,654
What was that?

164
00:10:56,102 --> 00:10:58,832
l'm guessing the threshold's clear now.

165
00:11:03,109 --> 00:11:05,339
l want to buy five shares of SGJ.
Now.

166
00:11:05,645 --> 00:11:07,875
Come on, time is money, my friend!

167
00:11:08,348 --> 00:11:09,337
Thank you!

168
00:11:11,351 --> 00:11:13,182
''Time is money, my friend?''

169
00:11:13,453 --> 00:11:15,478
You missed
''Takes money to make money''...

170
00:11:15,789 --> 00:11:19,623
...and ''Don't make me come down there
and kick your Wall Street butt.''

171
00:11:20,393 --> 00:11:23,692
l made $1 7 before breakfast.
What have you done?

172
00:11:23,963 --> 00:11:27,490
l had breakfast here,
so technically l saved $3.50.

173
00:11:29,035 --> 00:11:30,400
How did you make $1 7?

174
00:11:30,704 --> 00:11:32,899
Well, my financially
challenged friends...

175
00:11:33,306 --> 00:11:36,434
...l split my money and l bought
some shares of CHP and ZXY.

176
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,602
How come those?

177
00:11:39,012 --> 00:11:43,449
Well, CHP because l used to have a
crush on Erik Estrada.

178
00:11:44,651 --> 00:11:47,950
And ZXY because l think
it sounds ''zexy.''

179
00:11:49,055 --> 00:11:50,920
What happened to MEG?

180
00:11:51,257 --> 00:11:53,589
MEG was good for me, but l dumped her.

181
00:11:53,993 --> 00:11:56,985
My motto is, ''Get out
before they go down.''

182
00:11:58,398 --> 00:12:01,196
That is so not my motto.

183
00:12:07,907 --> 00:12:08,896
How's the dog?

184
00:12:09,242 --> 00:12:12,609
Okay. l talked to the vet.
People are so nice upstate.

185
00:12:12,912 --> 00:12:16,439
He said the little fella's gonna be
okay, and l can get him tomorrow.

186
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,274
-Good.
-Thank God.

187
00:12:18,585 --> 00:12:21,247
But he did have to have
a bunch of stitches.

188
00:12:21,554 --> 00:12:25,490
And he said that only once in a blue
moon does a dog's ear grow back.

189
00:12:26,192 --> 00:12:28,251
So still hoping.

190
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:35,463
Now are you going to call your dad
to let him know that his dog is okay?

191
00:12:35,902 --> 00:12:39,303
l don't want to meet my father
over the phone.

192
00:12:39,706 --> 00:12:42,140
What will l say,
''Hi, l'm the daughter you abandoned.

193
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:44,909
Oh, by the way, l broke your dog.''

194
00:12:46,146 --> 00:12:48,546
Hey, Pheebs, if you want, l'll do it.

195
00:12:50,617 --> 00:12:54,075
Listen, just don't say anything
about me, okay?

196
00:12:54,888 --> 00:12:55,820
Don't...

197
00:12:58,057 --> 00:12:59,991
...be too long with the phone.

198
00:13:00,894 --> 00:13:03,954
She'll be a much better friend
once the market closes.

199
00:13:07,033 --> 00:13:07,761
lt's a woman.

200
00:13:08,234 --> 00:13:09,428
So talk to her.

201
00:13:13,072 --> 00:13:14,334
Hello, Mrs. Buffay.

202
00:13:16,142 --> 00:13:18,337
l know where your dog is.

203
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:23,773
l want you to know he'll be returned
to you almost as good as new...

204
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,845
...within 24 hours.

205
00:13:26,152 --> 00:13:27,551
Goodbye.

206
00:13:34,527 --> 00:13:36,495
-Why the voice?
-Hard to say.

207
00:13:40,266 --> 00:13:41,460
Your cappuccino, sir.

208
00:13:41,768 --> 00:13:42,962
Thank you.

209
00:13:46,506 --> 00:13:49,805
-This is better than the coffeehouse.
-Absolutely.

210
00:13:58,985 --> 00:14:01,351
How come it's not mixing
with the water?

211
00:14:01,621 --> 00:14:03,987
The package says to keep it moving.

212
00:14:04,357 --> 00:14:06,621
Stir and drink, never let it settle.

213
00:14:12,265 --> 00:14:13,994
This is ridiculous.

214
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,928
After l get back from
my niece's christening...

215
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:21,536
...l'll go to the coffeehouse with you
and we'll have a cup of coffee.

216
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,207
No problem. Joey's there.

217
00:14:29,349 --> 00:14:34,184
l don't want to have to have Joey with
me every time l want decent coffee.

218
00:14:34,621 --> 00:14:38,022
And l don't want to drink
cappuccino with a ''k.''

219
00:14:38,391 --> 00:14:41,383
l say you and l go
and stand up to those guys.

220
00:14:41,661 --> 00:14:44,027
All right, hang on
a second there, Custer.

221
00:14:45,665 --> 00:14:48,031
Ross, have you ever
been beaten up before?

222
00:14:48,334 --> 00:14:49,198
Yeah, sure.

223
00:14:49,702 --> 00:14:52,193
By someone besides Monica?

224
00:14:53,573 --> 00:14:54,335
So what?

225
00:14:54,641 --> 00:14:58,577
So we get beaten up. Maybe that's
something a man has to go through.

226
00:14:58,878 --> 00:15:01,745
Like a rite of passage or something.

227
00:15:02,181 --> 00:15:05,116
Couldn't we just lose
our virginities again?

228
00:15:06,352 --> 00:15:09,014
Because l think actually
mine's growing back.

229
00:15:11,457 --> 00:15:13,516
-l need $100.
-What?

230
00:15:13,826 --> 00:15:15,316
Welcome home.

231
00:15:16,095 --> 00:15:17,426
-l need $100.
-For what?

232
00:15:17,697 --> 00:15:20,097
-To get back in the game.
-When did you get out?

233
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,062
l lost it all. l lost it.

234
00:15:23,536 --> 00:15:26,664
l've come to terms with it,
you have to, too.

235
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:32,974
Look, Mon, l'm really sorry.

236
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,906
Where are we on the $100?

237
00:15:35,248 --> 00:15:36,340
l don't have it.

238
00:15:36,616 --> 00:15:38,106
But l need it!

239
00:15:39,085 --> 00:15:41,417
Otherwise, l'll have to
take that diner job.

240
00:15:41,688 --> 00:15:45,784
You know, with the dancing
and the costumes.

241
00:15:49,095 --> 00:15:52,121
l don't want to have to wear
flame-retardant boobs.

242
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:55,767
Nobody does, honey.

243
00:15:59,806 --> 00:16:00,966
Noodle!

244
00:16:01,274 --> 00:16:05,608
Oh, my God. What the hell
happened to my dog?

245
00:16:05,979 --> 00:16:07,003
lt was an accident.

246
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,511
And the woman who did this
would never hurt a dog on purpose.

247
00:16:10,817 --> 00:16:12,375
She's a vegetarian.

248
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,878
Are these stitches?

249
00:16:15,254 --> 00:16:18,746
Yeah, eight of them.
That's 56 to him.

250
00:16:19,726 --> 00:16:22,354
lf it's raining, you can't
let him look up...

251
00:16:22,729 --> 00:16:24,788
...because that cone
will fill up fast.

252
00:16:26,766 --> 00:16:28,358
Thanks for bringing back
what's left of him.

253
00:16:28,668 --> 00:16:31,694
-ls Frank home?
-How do you know Frank?

254
00:16:32,005 --> 00:16:34,974
Just from a long time ago.
ls he here?

255
00:16:40,913 --> 00:16:41,777
What?

256
00:16:44,017 --> 00:16:45,348
l mean Frank Senior.

257
00:16:45,618 --> 00:16:47,245
He went out for groceries.

258
00:16:47,587 --> 00:16:48,747
Will he be back soon?

259
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:52,620
He left four years ago.
We're expecting him back any minute.

260
00:16:55,061 --> 00:16:56,085
l'm gonna go.

261
00:16:56,396 --> 00:16:58,591
l'm sorry about the dog.
Everything.

262
00:16:58,898 --> 00:16:59,830
l'm sorry.

263
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,667
Hey, lady!

264
00:17:02,201 --> 00:17:03,759
Hey, wait up!

265
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:12,033
-How do you know my dad?
-Well, l don't really.

266
00:17:12,345 --> 00:17:15,041
Just genetically.

267
00:17:15,681 --> 00:17:17,842
He's kind of my dad too.

268
00:17:18,451 --> 00:17:19,315
Heavy.

269
00:17:21,888 --> 00:17:25,517
So did he ever talk about me...Phoebe?

270
00:17:25,825 --> 00:17:28,293
No, but he didn't really talk
about anything.

271
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,097
Except stilts.

272
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,600
-Stilts?
-Yeah, he loved stilts.

273
00:17:35,868 --> 00:17:39,702
One time, l was upstairs stealing
cigarettes out of my mom's purse...

274
00:17:40,473 --> 00:17:42,737
...and all of a sudden l look over...

275
00:17:43,109 --> 00:17:45,839
...and there's Dad's head,
bobbing past the window.

276
00:17:47,747 --> 00:17:50,614
He just had this big smile on his face
and he was waving...

277
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:53,780
...because he was happiest
when he was on his stilts.

278
00:17:58,524 --> 00:18:00,355
l don't know what to do with that.

279
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,057
Me neither.

280
00:18:05,531 --> 00:18:07,897
So are you, like, my big sister?

281
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:11,595
This is huge. You can buy me beer!

282
00:18:12,905 --> 00:18:13,894
l'm not gonna.

283
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:18,836
But you know what's cool? lf you had
a friend named Pete, l could say...

284
00:18:19,212 --> 00:18:21,680
...''l know Pete.
He's friends with my brother.''

285
00:18:22,515 --> 00:18:25,279
-l got a friend named Mark.
-That'll work too.

286
00:18:25,618 --> 00:18:26,346
Cool. All right.

287
00:18:27,553 --> 00:18:31,512
So maybe, you know,
l could give you a call sometime.

288
00:18:32,592 --> 00:18:34,116
We could talk or something.

289
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,655
-Yeah, that'd be okay.
-All right.

290
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:38,453
l'm in the book.

291
00:18:43,202 --> 00:18:45,067
So stilts, huh?

292
00:18:45,905 --> 00:18:50,171
lf you want, l can show you where
he hit his head on the rain gutter.

293
00:18:55,114 --> 00:18:58,880
We did it. We're here.
We are standing our ground.

294
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,851
-How long does coffee take?
-Would you come on? Come on!

295
00:19:06,025 --> 00:19:07,049
Thank you.

296
00:19:18,604 --> 00:19:20,902
-There we go.
-l think we proved our point.

297
00:19:23,276 --> 00:19:25,836
-You burn your mouth?
-Cannot feel my tongue.

298
00:19:30,616 --> 00:19:32,083
Bullies! Big bullies!

299
00:19:32,752 --> 00:19:35,812
Look who's here.
lt's the weenies.

300
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,218
Did we not make ourselves clear
the other day?

301
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,857
That's why we're here.

302
00:19:42,195 --> 00:19:44,390
Yes, we're standing our ground.

303
00:19:44,997 --> 00:19:46,726
Apparently.

304
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,599
Let's do this already.

305
00:19:48,968 --> 00:19:49,900
You got a weapon?

306
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,866
A nice watch.
l don't want to break it on your ribs.

307
00:19:54,173 --> 00:19:55,333
All right, let's do this.

308
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:01,738
Question: lf l don't care about
my watch, can l use it as a weapon?

309
00:20:02,148 --> 00:20:04,139
-What do you mean?
-lt's sharp, it's metal.

310
00:20:04,483 --> 00:20:07,213
l think l can do some
serious damage with it.

311
00:20:08,087 --> 00:20:09,816
No, you can't use your watch.

312
00:20:11,524 --> 00:20:13,151
Or your keys.

313
00:20:14,026 --> 00:20:15,323
Here's what we'll do.

314
00:20:15,695 --> 00:20:19,028
We'll put all keys and watches
in the hat over there.

315
00:20:19,532 --> 00:20:20,464
All right?

316
00:20:22,568 --> 00:20:24,968
All right, come on, man. Let's do it!

317
00:20:25,371 --> 00:20:28,772
Before l forget, are we hitting faces?

318
00:20:29,175 --> 00:20:30,870
Of course. Why wouldn't you hit faces?

319
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:34,373
l have to work on Monday.
l have a big presentation.

320
00:20:35,715 --> 00:20:38,582
Actually, l gotta show
this apartment tomorrow...

321
00:20:38,918 --> 00:20:42,115
...and this no-faces thing
might not be a bad idea.

322
00:20:43,522 --> 00:20:44,750
Nothing from the neck up.

323
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:48,317
Or the waist down.

324
00:20:49,395 --> 00:20:52,125
-Dana's ovulating.
-Really? You guys trying again?

325
00:20:53,532 --> 00:20:56,501
Let me get this straight.
We're talking about the middle?

326
00:20:56,836 --> 00:20:57,632
Come on!

327
00:20:58,104 --> 00:21:01,665
You want a piece of this?
l'm standing here!

328
00:21:03,609 --> 00:21:05,474
Those guys are taking our stuff!

329
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:12,779
God, that was amazing.
That was incredible.

330
00:21:13,152 --> 00:21:15,950
-You guys kicked butt!
-Us? What about you guys?

331
00:21:16,255 --> 00:21:18,951
You really gave it to
old Mr. Clean back there.

332
00:21:19,325 --> 00:21:21,953
-He was a big guy.
-Yeah, he was, wasn't he?

333
00:21:22,261 --> 00:21:24,126
l wouldn't know,
having missed everything.

334
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,464
Don't do that to yourself.

335
00:21:26,766 --> 00:21:30,497
Any one of us could have tripped
over that little girl's jump rope.

336
00:21:32,872 --> 00:21:35,363
So listen, guys...

337
00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:38,035
...are we okay here?

338
00:21:40,479 --> 00:21:41,468
We're okay.

339
00:21:42,181 --> 00:21:43,808
So can l have my hat back?

340
00:22:00,499 --> 00:22:02,228
Oh, my God. Look at her.

341
00:22:03,402 --> 00:22:04,232
Hi, Monica!

342
00:22:05,805 --> 00:22:06,897
How's it going?

343
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:08,536
Hey, nice boobs.

344
00:22:10,109 --> 00:22:11,838
Guys, guys. Check this out.

345
00:22:30,996 --> 00:22:32,429
Excellent.
