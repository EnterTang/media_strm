1
00:00:06,253 --> 00:00:07,447
Hey.

2
00:00:07,621 --> 00:00:12,251
- What you guys doing?
- Monica's making us watch Old Yeller.

3
00:00:13,126 --> 00:00:17,654
Why are you guys upset?
It's Old Yeller. It's a happy movie.

4
00:00:17,831 --> 00:00:23,736
- What are you talking about?
- Happy family gets a dog. Frontier fun!

5
00:00:25,572 --> 00:00:27,403
Pheebs, what about the end?

6
00:00:27,574 --> 00:00:30,737
When Yeller saves the family
and everyone's happy?

7
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:32,105
That's not the end.

8
00:00:33,447 --> 00:00:37,645
That's when my mother would
shut off the TV and say, "The end."

9
00:00:37,851 --> 00:00:39,682
What about when he has rabies?

10
00:00:39,853 --> 00:00:43,289
He doesn't have rabies.
He has babies.

11
00:00:44,324 --> 00:00:45,916
That's what my mom said.

12
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:51,458
I don't think she'd want you
to see what's about to happen.

13
00:00:51,631 --> 00:00:55,294
Why? What's about to happen?
I've never seen this part.

14
00:00:55,669 --> 00:00:58,536
Hey, Travis, what you doing
with that gun?

15
00:01:01,174 --> 00:01:02,300
Oh, no.

16
00:01:02,476 --> 00:01:04,774
No, Travis, put down the gun.

17
00:01:05,178 --> 00:01:07,703
No, he's your buddy.
He's your Yeller.

18
00:01:08,014 --> 00:01:09,379
No! The end! The end!

19
00:01:12,986 --> 00:01:17,480
Okay, what kind of a sick
doggy snuff film is this?

20
00:01:18,158 --> 00:01:20,285
The One Where Old Yeller Dies

21
00:02:05,038 --> 00:02:10,032
Have you eaten? Richard and I
just finished, and we have leftovers.

22
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,337
Chicken and potatoes.

23
00:02:12,913 --> 00:02:14,813
What am I wearing?

24
00:02:15,682 --> 00:02:18,583
Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.

25
00:02:23,824 --> 00:02:27,316
One day, you'll really be naked
and we won't come over.

26
00:02:28,528 --> 00:02:31,292
That'd teach me a lesson.

27
00:02:32,232 --> 00:02:34,894
I've got a leg, three breasts
and a wing.

28
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:37,229
How do you find clothes that fit?

29
00:02:38,638 --> 00:02:40,697
Hey, Monica? We got a question.

30
00:02:40,974 --> 00:02:44,307
Yes, I see other women
in the shower at the gym.

31
00:02:44,578 --> 00:02:46,705
And no, I don't look.

32
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,177
No, not that one.

33
00:02:48,482 --> 00:02:51,315
We have an extra ticket
to the Knicks game.

34
00:02:51,551 --> 00:02:56,079
Ross can't go, so it's between my
friend Eric, who has breath issues...

35
00:02:56,723 --> 00:03:00,181
...and Dan, with the poking.
"Did you see that play?"

36
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,686
"You want more beer?
Is that Spike Lee?"

37
00:03:06,066 --> 00:03:08,398
Why don't you ask Richard?

38
00:03:08,735 --> 00:03:12,102
Richard, if you had
an extra ticket to the Knicks...

39
00:03:14,908 --> 00:03:18,071
...and you had to choose between
a friend who smells...

40
00:03:18,278 --> 00:03:21,975
...and one who bruises you,
who would you pick?

41
00:03:22,148 --> 00:03:23,445
Wow.

42
00:03:23,617 --> 00:03:25,448
Being a Knicks fan myself...

43
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:29,655
...I think you should take someone
who's a huge Knicks fan.

44
00:03:30,257 --> 00:03:31,622
Okay.

45
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,452
That's Eric.

46
00:03:34,628 --> 00:03:36,789
Glad to be of help.
Matches.

47
00:03:38,265 --> 00:03:41,598
I meant, why don't you
take Richard to the game?

48
00:03:42,235 --> 00:03:43,395
What?

49
00:03:44,871 --> 00:03:46,862
- I don't know.
- Come on!

50
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:51,440
He keeps his fingers to himself,
and he's always minty fresh.

51
00:03:51,711 --> 00:03:55,477
Richard's really nice.
We just don't know him really well.

52
00:03:55,649 --> 00:03:57,173
Plus, he's old...

53
00:03:59,553 --> 00:04:01,953
...er than some people.

54
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:05,947
But younger than some buildings.

55
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:09,659
So he's a little older. Big deal.

56
00:04:09,963 --> 00:04:11,396
He's important to me.

57
00:04:11,565 --> 00:04:15,331
If you ask him,
he might take you in his Jag.

58
00:04:19,406 --> 00:04:20,805
How do we say yes...

59
00:04:20,974 --> 00:04:25,138
...and make it seem like
it's not just to ride in the cool car?

60
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:27,604
Okay, this could be tough.

61
00:04:28,682 --> 00:04:30,081
Monica?

62
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,911
We'll bring him,
but only if he takes the Jaguar.

63
00:04:36,323 --> 00:04:38,223
You almost had it.

64
00:04:44,564 --> 00:04:46,759
No, no, you're fine. You're fine.

65
00:04:49,135 --> 00:04:50,762
Hi, honey.

66
00:04:50,937 --> 00:04:53,462
You are not gonna believe
what happened!

67
00:04:53,673 --> 00:04:56,836
We were on the floor,
and he grabs the table...

68
00:04:57,043 --> 00:04:59,739
...and he pulls himself up!

69
00:05:00,547 --> 00:05:02,640
He pulled himself up!

70
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:04,339
Standing man!

71
00:05:05,552 --> 00:05:09,215
Sorry you missed it,
but I taped it if you wanna see.

72
00:05:10,156 --> 00:05:14,616
- He already did it last week.
- You can watch our tape if you want.

73
00:05:14,794 --> 00:05:19,288
See, I don't believe this.
I miss the first time of everything.

74
00:05:19,532 --> 00:05:23,628
The first time he rolled over,
the first time he crawled.

75
00:05:23,803 --> 00:05:28,035
Has he spoken? Is he driving?
Does he have a favorite liqueur?

76
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,802
He is getting closer
on the talking thing.

77
00:05:31,044 --> 00:05:34,309
He can't quite say "mama,"
but once he said, "Yemen."

78
00:05:34,547 --> 00:05:38,347
See, I don't know.
I'm so sick of missing stuff.

79
00:05:38,652 --> 00:05:42,088
I want him for more than a day.
I want a weekend.

80
00:05:42,355 --> 00:05:44,949
- Listen. I feel...
- That would be great.

81
00:05:47,894 --> 00:05:50,590
Really? I had a whole speech prepared.

82
00:05:50,764 --> 00:05:53,733
Shoot, that would've been fun.

83
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:57,362
Did you just see that?

84
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:00,095
Did you see? He just waved!
He just waved!

85
00:06:00,273 --> 00:06:02,571
He's never waved before!

86
00:06:02,742 --> 00:06:05,734
Yes, he has. Very good.

87
00:06:08,648 --> 00:06:10,240
Hey, what you got there?

88
00:06:10,517 --> 00:06:14,385
Love Story, Brian's Song and
Terms of Endearment.

89
00:06:15,522 --> 00:06:20,960
All you need now is The Killing Fields
and guacamole, and you've got a party!

90
00:06:21,394 --> 00:06:24,386
I talked to my grandma
about Old Yeller...

91
00:06:24,631 --> 00:06:28,397
...and she said my mom didn't show us
the ends of sad movies...

92
00:06:28,702 --> 00:06:31,466
...to shield us from
the pain and sadness.

93
00:06:31,638 --> 00:06:34,106
You know, before she killed herself.

94
00:06:37,977 --> 00:06:40,138
Where's Richard?
Did you ditch him?

95
00:06:40,747 --> 00:06:44,615
After we stole his lunch money
and gave him a wedgie.

96
00:06:45,051 --> 00:06:47,315
What's with you? He's parking.

97
00:06:47,987 --> 00:06:51,889
- Did you guys have fun?
- Your boyfriend is so cool.

98
00:06:52,158 --> 00:06:56,254
He let us drive his Jaguar.
Joey for 12 blocks. Me for 15.

99
00:06:58,031 --> 00:06:59,521
He must like you best.

100
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,463
And when he tipped the guy
who showed us to our seats?

101
00:07:03,636 --> 00:07:05,797
You never saw the money.
Like this:

102
00:07:05,972 --> 00:07:09,237
Hey, Chandler, thanks
for showing us to our seats.

103
00:07:09,642 --> 00:07:12,770
You're welcome.
Hey, thanks for parking the car.

104
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:14,674
No problem.

105
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:18,918
- Hey, Chandler...
- I think they get it.

106
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,720
There's the man!

107
00:07:24,124 --> 00:07:25,853
You're getting better.

108
00:07:26,626 --> 00:07:28,958
I'm gonna keep this, by the way.

109
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,059
He kept my dollar.

110
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:42,198
- Your first weekend without Ben.
- We're going to colonial Williamsburg.

111
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:47,005
A woman I went to college with
is the first female blacksmith there.

112
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,014
They're a little behind the times
in colonial Williamsburg.

113
00:07:51,184 --> 00:07:54,119
I better go before Mommy
starts weeping.

114
00:07:54,888 --> 00:07:57,186
- We love you.
- Bye, Mommy.

115
00:07:57,357 --> 00:07:59,257
- Bye.
- Have a good time.

116
00:08:01,594 --> 00:08:03,858
Ross? Look.

117
00:08:11,037 --> 00:08:14,871
Joey, do you know
we can see you from here?

118
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,703
How come Richard
looks cooler with these?

119
00:08:17,877 --> 00:08:22,211
You may want to light it
and lose the spatula.

120
00:08:23,082 --> 00:08:25,607
It's cute, trying to be like Richard.

121
00:08:25,785 --> 00:08:30,484
Not like him, per se.
Just not unlike him.

122
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,867
It's the artist formerly known
as Chandler.

123
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:47,134
I'm just trying something here,
you know?

124
00:08:47,307 --> 00:08:50,401
- Why didn't you grow a mustache?
- We flipped for it.

125
00:08:50,577 --> 00:08:53,444
I got the cigar,
he got the mustache.

126
00:08:54,013 --> 00:08:57,244
If we both grew them,
we'd look like dorks.

127
00:08:57,417 --> 00:09:00,181
You really sidestepped
that land mine.

128
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,681
- We gotta meet Richard downstairs.
- You're meeting Richard?

129
00:09:04,858 --> 00:09:06,587
- Hockey.
- Didn't he tell you?

130
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:10,092
He said he'd be with the guys.
I didn't know that's you.

131
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,556
You hear that?

132
00:09:11,798 --> 00:09:13,561
We're the guys!

133
00:09:15,034 --> 00:09:17,525
That mustache reminds me
of Aunt Sylvia.

134
00:09:17,737 --> 00:09:19,762
Thank you!

135
00:09:28,047 --> 00:09:29,981
Hi. We're visiting.

136
00:09:30,717 --> 00:09:33,743
It's Ben and his dada.

137
00:09:36,522 --> 00:09:42,222
Can you say "dada"? I'm gonna tell
your mommies you said it anyway.

138
00:09:42,395 --> 00:09:43,953
No luck, huh?

139
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,496
A while ago,
I got a "se" out of him...

140
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:51,634
...which I thought might turn into
"secondary caregiver," but...

141
00:09:54,607 --> 00:09:58,373
Would you hold him for a sec?
I gotta take this off.

142
00:09:58,578 --> 00:10:00,478
Sure. Okay.

143
00:10:06,185 --> 00:10:07,413
What are you doing?

144
00:10:07,587 --> 00:10:09,646
I'm holding Ben.

145
00:10:11,858 --> 00:10:14,588
He's a baby, not a bomb.

146
00:10:15,695 --> 00:10:20,530
- Hold him like you'd hold a football.
- This is how I would hold a football.

147
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,930
Here. Here. There we go.

148
00:10:23,102 --> 00:10:27,562
Sorry, I'm not very good with babies.
I haven't been around them.

149
00:10:27,774 --> 00:10:29,867
I mean, since I was one.

150
00:10:30,109 --> 00:10:32,839
- It's all right. No big deal.
- Really?

151
00:10:33,012 --> 00:10:36,004
You'll feel different
when it's our baby.

152
00:10:36,182 --> 00:10:37,911
- What?
- What?

153
00:10:38,785 --> 00:10:41,345
You think about stuff like that?

154
00:10:41,521 --> 00:10:43,546
Yeah.

155
00:10:44,624 --> 00:10:48,993
Actually, I kind of think
that we'll have two babies.

156
00:10:49,662 --> 00:10:51,926
Two babies?

157
00:10:52,098 --> 00:10:54,191
You know, a boy and a girl.

158
00:10:54,467 --> 00:10:58,927
Hopefully, the girl will come first,
so Ben won't feel competitive.

159
00:11:00,573 --> 00:11:02,302
Then what's gonna happen?

160
00:11:02,475 --> 00:11:07,378
We won't wanna raise kids in the city,
so we'll move to Scarsdale.

161
00:11:08,548 --> 00:11:11,949
It's far enough from our parents
not to see them...

162
00:11:12,118 --> 00:11:14,586
...but close enough
for them to babysit.

163
00:11:14,754 --> 00:11:19,020
And yes, I know the taxes are
a little higher than Nassau County...

164
00:11:19,258 --> 00:11:22,125
...but the school system's great.

165
00:11:24,564 --> 00:11:26,828
Wow, that's great! Great!

166
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:31,763
Okay, you know what?
I'm off my break now.

167
00:11:33,106 --> 00:11:34,630
Here. You take this.

168
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,568
I'm gonna go pour
these very nice people some coffee.

169
00:11:41,514 --> 00:11:46,213
Look at that. I don't have a pot.
Maybe I've got one at home.

170
00:11:46,452 --> 00:11:48,750
Or in Scarsdale.
Hey, is that a door?

171
00:11:56,529 --> 00:11:59,293
- Hey.
- Hey, Pheebs. What's happening?

172
00:11:59,465 --> 00:12:03,959
Murder, cancer, soccer teams
eating each other in the Andes.

173
00:12:04,337 --> 00:12:08,330
- I was really just making small talk.
- Well, I was just venting.

174
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:11,336
So you watched the movies?

175
00:12:11,511 --> 00:12:14,002
What is happening to the world?

176
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,415
I mean, because E.T. Leaves...

177
00:12:17,617 --> 00:12:20,415
...and Rocky loses. Charlotte dies.

178
00:12:20,586 --> 00:12:22,247
Charlotte who?

179
00:12:22,422 --> 00:12:25,858
With the web. The spider.
She has babies and dies.

180
00:12:26,092 --> 00:12:30,222
It's like, "Welcome home
from the hospital." Thud!

181
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,023
- You wanna feel better?
- Yeah.

182
00:12:35,268 --> 00:12:37,930
Here. Watch this.

183
00:12:38,104 --> 00:12:40,664
It's a Wonderful Life.
I've heard of this.

184
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:43,501
You can't lose.
It's there in the title.

185
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:45,506
Wonderfulness is baked in.

186
00:12:45,678 --> 00:12:48,238
I thought so with
The Pride of the Yankees.

187
00:12:48,414 --> 00:12:54,011
I thought it was about Yankee pride,
and the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease.

188
00:12:55,421 --> 00:12:59,721
The guy was Lou Gehrig.
Didn't you kind of see it coming?

189
00:13:01,694 --> 00:13:05,391
Watch that. It'll restore
all your faith in humanity.

190
00:13:05,631 --> 00:13:07,292
Hey, big guy. Game time.

191
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:10,334
- Hey! Be right there!
- There's a game?

192
00:13:10,503 --> 00:13:13,734
I just got my Pik-Up Stiks
back from the shop.

193
00:13:14,874 --> 00:13:17,365
Bring your nerves of steel.

194
00:13:19,212 --> 00:13:21,146
It's the basketball playoffs.

195
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:25,817
I appreciate this, but you don't
have to hang out with them for me.

196
00:13:26,052 --> 00:13:27,542
They have each other.

197
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,915
Oh, no, honey. Don't worry.

198
00:13:30,156 --> 00:13:34,058
I like hanging out with them.
They're not like my other friends.

199
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:38,890
They don't start sentences with,
"Guess who just died shoveling snow?"

200
00:13:39,499 --> 00:13:42,229
All right, that's great.
Then just go.

201
00:13:42,568 --> 00:13:44,092
Go Knicks!

202
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,999
It's the college playoffs.

203
00:13:46,172 --> 00:13:48,606
- Then, go Vassar!
- They're not in it.

204
00:13:48,774 --> 00:13:50,605
- Okay, then just go.
- Okay.

205
00:13:52,979 --> 00:13:54,810
Why does this bother me?

206
00:13:55,081 --> 00:13:59,780
I'm not one of those people who wants
to spend 24 hours a day together.

207
00:13:59,952 --> 00:14:01,214
Sure.

208
00:14:01,387 --> 00:14:04,550
He just doesn't have much free time.
What do I do?

209
00:14:04,724 --> 00:14:09,889
Does it matter? You'll ultimately die,
divorce or blow your pet's head off.

210
00:14:12,765 --> 00:14:13,754
Me too!

211
00:14:13,933 --> 00:14:17,391
I got a question.
Richard made plans with the guys...

212
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,538
Ross made plans for the century.

213
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,969
I'm gonna go read Cosmo.
Maybe there's something helpful in it.

214
00:14:24,143 --> 00:14:28,773
If not, I can learn how to do
a bikini wax with Christmas candles.

215
00:14:31,817 --> 00:14:33,910
What happened back there?

216
00:14:34,086 --> 00:14:37,487
You tell me.
One minute I'm holding Ben.

217
00:14:37,657 --> 00:14:41,957
Then I have two kids and live in
Scarsdale, complaining about taxes!

218
00:14:42,128 --> 00:14:44,653
Well, I'm sorry.
I think about stuff.

219
00:14:44,897 --> 00:14:48,594
You're at work, assembling bones.
Your mind wanders.

220
00:14:48,768 --> 00:14:52,431
You planned ahead 20 years.
We've dated for six weeks!

221
00:14:52,638 --> 00:14:54,697
You never think about our future?

222
00:14:54,874 --> 00:14:57,900
I think about whose apartment
we'll sleep at...

223
00:14:58,144 --> 00:15:00,169
...and where we'll have dinner!

224
00:15:00,346 --> 00:15:03,804
I do not think about
our children's names!

225
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,742
You know what our children's names
are gonna be?

226
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,357
No. I mean, I read a book,
and there was a girl named Emily.

227
00:15:12,558 --> 00:15:15,686
And I thought that might be good.

228
00:15:16,729 --> 00:15:18,424
What was the book?

229
00:15:18,931 --> 00:15:21,866
The Big Book of Children's Names.

230
00:15:22,134 --> 00:15:24,568
Okay, Ross. Listen.

231
00:15:24,837 --> 00:15:26,429
What we have is amazing.

232
00:15:26,606 --> 00:15:29,302
But I do not want everything
decided for me!

233
00:15:29,475 --> 00:15:33,969
I spent my whole life like that.
That's the reason I left Barry.

234
00:15:34,146 --> 00:15:36,137
I like not knowing right now.

235
00:15:36,315 --> 00:15:40,376
Sorry if that scares you,
but if you want me, deal with that!

236
00:15:40,553 --> 00:15:42,316
- Okay, fine!
- Thank you!

237
00:15:42,488 --> 00:15:45,218
- We're not done!
- I didn't know that.

238
00:15:45,391 --> 00:15:49,452
You're with a guy who won't stop
planning his future with you.

239
00:15:49,662 --> 00:15:51,493
He knows we'll be together.

240
00:15:51,764 --> 00:15:54,858
If that scares you, tough!
Deal with that.

241
00:15:55,034 --> 00:15:57,025
- I will!
- Good, because I love you!

242
00:15:57,203 --> 00:15:58,830
Oh, yeah? I love you too!

243
00:15:59,005 --> 00:16:01,235
That's the first time we said it!

244
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,931
- I'm gonna kiss you!
- You better!

245
00:16:11,851 --> 00:16:13,409
Thanks for the movie.

246
00:16:13,586 --> 00:16:15,520
- Did you like it?
- Oh, yeah.

247
00:16:15,688 --> 00:16:19,180
Was I happier when George
destroyed the business...

248
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:24,452
...or Donna Reed cried or when
the pharmacist made his ear bleed?

249
00:16:25,097 --> 00:16:28,066
I'll give you that,
but wasn't the ending great?

250
00:16:28,234 --> 00:16:32,933
I was too depressed to watch it.
It should've been called:

251
00:16:33,172 --> 00:16:38,075
It's a Sucky Life, and Just When You
Think It Can't Suck Anymore, It Does!

252
00:16:40,212 --> 00:16:41,645
Kick, save! And...

253
00:16:41,881 --> 00:16:43,143
...denied!

254
00:16:43,849 --> 00:16:47,216
He gets it back.
Pass to the middle, lines it up...

255
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,420
Yes! Could that shot be any prettier?

256
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,519
- Man, you are incredible.
- We had a table in college.

257
00:16:56,696 --> 00:16:59,961
I didn't know they had foosball
in the 1800s.

258
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:05,467
Nice mustache. When puberty hits,
that thing will really kick in.

259
00:17:08,908 --> 00:17:12,571
Not to sound too Florence Henderson,
but dinner's ready.

260
00:17:12,812 --> 00:17:13,870
One more point.

261
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:18,314
Score!

262
00:17:19,719 --> 00:17:21,243
Now can we go?

263
00:17:21,821 --> 00:17:24,119
That's why we don't let her play.

264
00:17:26,325 --> 00:17:27,917
Is everything all right?

265
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:32,793
Don't be mad at him.
It's our fault.

266
00:17:32,965 --> 00:17:37,299
- Sorry we're hogging his time.
- He's just great to hang out with.

267
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:40,268
We were just talking about this.

268
00:17:40,439 --> 00:17:43,431
He is so much cooler than our dads.

269
00:17:45,311 --> 00:17:48,610
Our dads are okay and all,
but Richard is just...

270
00:17:48,781 --> 00:17:50,908
What are you kicking me for?

271
00:17:51,784 --> 00:17:54,116
I'm trying to talk here.

272
00:17:56,522 --> 00:17:58,422
You guys see me as a dad?

273
00:17:58,591 --> 00:18:00,559
- Oh, yeah!
- No!

274
00:18:01,761 --> 00:18:03,626
No.

275
00:18:04,296 --> 00:18:08,426
You're clearly not familiar
with our young persons' vernacular.

276
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:11,932
When we say "dad," we mean "buddy."

277
00:18:12,872 --> 00:18:14,601
We mean "pal."

278
00:18:14,774 --> 00:18:17,572
No, seriously. Joey's my dad.

279
00:18:20,312 --> 00:18:22,143
Monica's my dad.

280
00:18:22,581 --> 00:18:25,448
I've even got some dads down at work.

281
00:18:25,985 --> 00:18:27,043
That's fine.

282
00:18:27,219 --> 00:18:31,383
Well, your other dad and I are gonna
go have a romantic evening.

283
00:18:31,624 --> 00:18:33,649
I'll just see you kids around.

284
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:35,221
Nighty-night.

285
00:18:35,394 --> 00:18:37,021
You're not a dad!

286
00:18:38,464 --> 00:18:40,728
I can't believe you got us
into trouble.

287
00:18:55,014 --> 00:18:58,108
- So are you okay?
- Yeah.

288
00:18:58,584 --> 00:18:59,573
Just...

289
00:18:59,852 --> 00:19:02,320
...I feel like I'm about 100.

290
00:19:02,988 --> 00:19:05,650
I thought I was just one of the guys.

291
00:19:06,258 --> 00:19:07,418
Come here.

292
00:19:07,693 --> 00:19:10,287
I'll make you feel like
one of the guys.

293
00:19:16,268 --> 00:19:20,102
For a really cool guy,
you suck at foosball.

294
00:19:20,272 --> 00:19:22,035
What? I was killing them.

295
00:19:22,374 --> 00:19:24,604
Yeah, well they suck too.

296
00:19:27,713 --> 00:19:31,444
Take the poopy diaper
and put it in the poopy diaper pail.

297
00:19:31,617 --> 00:19:36,816
Calling it a poopy diaper
doesn't make this process any cuter.

298
00:19:39,325 --> 00:19:40,622
- Hello?
- It's us.

299
00:19:40,793 --> 00:19:43,387
Come on up.
I'll get his stuff together.

300
00:19:43,562 --> 00:19:46,622
Okay, we can do this now,
can't we, Ben?

301
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:51,093
Yes, we can.
Yes, we can.

302
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,970
There! I did it!

303
00:19:55,174 --> 00:19:56,436
I did it!

304
00:19:57,443 --> 00:19:59,343
Look at that!

305
00:19:59,812 --> 00:20:01,905
It stays on and everything.

306
00:20:02,414 --> 00:20:04,939
- Hi!
- Hi.

307
00:20:08,954 --> 00:20:12,549
I'm sorry. What did you just say?
Did you just say hi?

308
00:20:12,758 --> 00:20:15,750
Oh, my God! Ross?
Ben just said hi!

309
00:20:16,462 --> 00:20:18,987
- Ben just said hi!
- The word "hi"?

310
00:20:19,164 --> 00:20:21,029
No, my Uncle Hi.

311
00:20:22,101 --> 00:20:25,070
Great, I missed that too!
I miss everything!

312
00:20:25,237 --> 00:20:29,071
Oh, I'm sorry. I guess I just
bring it out in him.

313
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:32,033
- Hello! Where is he?
- We missed you.

314
00:20:32,278 --> 00:20:35,839
We missed you so much!
Come here, Ben.

315
00:20:36,015 --> 00:20:39,178
Guess what?
Ben just said his first word.

316
00:20:39,351 --> 00:20:42,286
- What did he say?
- Something about, "Hi."

317
00:20:43,656 --> 00:20:46,989
- That's so exciting!
- Mommy's so proud of you!

318
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:48,854
Hi!
Hi?

319
00:20:49,395 --> 00:20:52,523
You know, actually,
it's more like, "Hi!"

320
00:20:57,136 --> 00:21:01,163
- This could go on for a while.
- Yeah, we've got a cab waiting.

321
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,069
Well, this was fun.

322
00:21:03,242 --> 00:21:07,144
We should do it again sometime, Ben.
What do you say?

323
00:21:07,646 --> 00:21:10,308
- All right, so I've got him?
- Tuesday.

324
00:21:10,616 --> 00:21:12,641
- Bye, you guys.
- Take care.

325
00:21:12,818 --> 00:21:14,877
- Bye, Ben.
- Bye.

326
00:21:17,723 --> 00:21:21,284
Did he just say bye?
He said bye!

327
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,892
You said bye!
He said bye to me!

328
00:21:24,063 --> 00:21:25,655
Yes, he did!

329
00:21:25,898 --> 00:21:29,425
Suddenly I'm seeing him
go off to college!

330
00:21:29,635 --> 00:21:32,729
We've gotta go.
We've got that cab downstairs.

331
00:21:33,472 --> 00:21:34,769
See you later.

332
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,999
- Bye!
- Bye.

333
00:21:52,358 --> 00:21:54,986
Look at this nice deep hole I dug.

334
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,958
Hey, Bert, isn't this a nice hole?

335
00:21:58,764 --> 00:22:04,669
This is the part where Ernie buries
Bert in the sand and can't find him.

336
00:22:05,137 --> 00:22:09,437
I've looked ahead on the tape,
and he does find him again.

337
00:22:10,175 --> 00:22:13,804
But before that happens,
there's some rough going.

338
00:22:14,013 --> 00:22:16,106
But I think we can handle it.

339
00:22:16,415 --> 00:22:21,352
And there's just the alphabet,
but we know that ends well, so...

340
00:22:21,854 --> 00:22:23,583
Here we go.

341
00:22:23,756 --> 00:22:26,122
Bert? Bert?

342
00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:30,186
What happened to Bert?
He was here a moment ago.

343
00:22:30,362 --> 00:22:32,694
Oh, no! My old friend Bert is lost.

344
00:22:32,865 --> 00:22:34,696
I'm so glad you're here.

345
00:22:34,796 --> 00:22:35,796
