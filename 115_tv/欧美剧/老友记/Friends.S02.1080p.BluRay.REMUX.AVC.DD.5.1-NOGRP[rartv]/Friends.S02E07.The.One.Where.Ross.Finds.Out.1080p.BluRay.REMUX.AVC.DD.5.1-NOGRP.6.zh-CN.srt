1
00:00:02,449 --> 00:00:05,509
Okay, what is it about me?
Do I not look fun?

2
00:00:05,686 --> 00:00:09,554
Is there something
repellent about me?

3
00:00:09,723 --> 00:00:10,917
How was the party?

4
00:00:11,091 --> 00:00:15,494
It couldn't have been worse.
A woman literally passed through me.

5
00:00:15,696 --> 00:00:17,664
Am I hideously unattractive?

6
00:00:18,065 --> 00:00:20,863
No, you are not.
You are very attractive.

7
00:00:21,034 --> 00:00:22,763
I do the same thing.

8
00:00:22,969 --> 00:00:27,463
When I put on a little weight,
I question everything.

9
00:00:30,577 --> 00:00:32,738
I致e put on weight?

10
00:00:33,113 --> 00:00:35,047
Did you want to...?

11
00:00:37,117 --> 00:00:40,484
No, not weight.
More like insulation.

12
00:00:42,155 --> 00:00:44,885
I知 unemployed,
in need of a project.

13
00:00:45,158 --> 00:00:47,558
Wanna work out?
I can remake you.

14
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:51,356
That might get in the way
of my lying-around time.

15
00:00:51,732 --> 00:00:54,826
-Please?
-Come on, let her do it!

16
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:55,990
All right.

17
00:00:56,203 --> 00:01:00,264
But if my boobs are bigger
than yours, I知 going home.

18
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:05,608
Your boobs are fine. I never
should have said anything. Come here.

19
00:01:08,348 --> 00:01:11,681
Can't make hands meet!

20
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,413
The One Where Ross Finds Out

21
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:09,600
Let's do it!

22
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:15,470
What?

23
00:02:15,982 --> 00:02:19,918
Just never seen your
little stretchy pants before.

24
00:02:20,787 --> 00:02:22,516
It's cute.

25
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,888
And we're changing.

26
00:02:40,407 --> 00:02:42,466
Come on, give me five more!

27
00:02:42,676 --> 00:02:44,541
Five more!

28
00:02:45,912 --> 00:02:47,573
Five more and I値l flash you.

29
00:02:47,747 --> 00:02:49,180
One...

30
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:51,912
...two...

31
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:54,848
...two and a half.

32
00:02:57,424 --> 00:02:58,618
Just show me one of them.

33
00:03:15,642 --> 00:03:17,906
She's insane.
The woman's insane.

34
00:03:18,111 --> 00:03:20,705
Before work, after work,
during work.

35
00:03:20,914 --> 00:03:24,247
She's got me doing
butt-clenches at my desk.

36
00:03:24,417 --> 00:03:27,352
Now they won't
bring me my mail anymore.

37
00:03:28,021 --> 00:03:29,318
Tell her to stop.

38
00:03:29,523 --> 00:03:32,617
No, while she's unemployed
I知 all she's got.

39
00:03:32,826 --> 00:03:36,626
Why don't we all pitch in
and buy her a restaurant?

40
00:03:38,532 --> 00:03:40,432
How'd it go with Scott?

41
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,931
It was nice.
Went to a romantic restaurant...

42
00:03:44,104 --> 00:03:46,072
...ordered champagne. Nice.

43
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:50,039
-He still won't put out?
-Nope. Zilch. Nothing.

44
00:03:50,877 --> 00:03:52,401
Sorry, Pheebs.

45
00:03:53,213 --> 00:03:56,546
I don't mind taking it slow.
I like him a lot.

46
00:03:56,783 --> 00:03:59,843
He's interesting,
and he's really sweet.

47
00:04:00,053 --> 00:04:01,953
Why won't he give it up?

48
00:04:03,156 --> 00:04:06,421
Maybe he drives on
the other side of the road.

49
00:04:06,626 --> 00:04:08,787
If you know what I mean.

50
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:12,462
No. What do you mean?
He's not British.

51
00:04:15,435 --> 00:04:17,096
Maybe he's gay.

52
00:04:19,506 --> 00:04:21,565
I don't think that's it.

53
00:04:21,775 --> 00:04:24,335
We went dancing
the other night...

54
00:04:24,544 --> 00:04:28,071
...and the way he held me
and looked into my eyes...

55
00:04:28,281 --> 00:04:30,841
...I definitely felt something.

56
00:04:31,017 --> 00:04:33,451
How much can you tell
from a look?

57
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,589
No, I felt it on my hip.
I could tell.

58
00:04:39,192 --> 00:04:41,717
Yo, Bing!
Racquetball in 20 minutes.

59
00:04:42,829 --> 00:04:46,458
Joey, be a pal.
Lift my hand and smack her with it.

60
00:04:48,602 --> 00:04:51,196
-Oh, Rachel! Don't look.
-What?

61
00:04:53,306 --> 00:04:56,571
I don't care.
I have a date tonight.

62
00:04:56,776 --> 00:04:59,711
-You have a date?
-Monica's setting me up.

63
00:05:00,547 --> 00:05:02,640
What about Ross and....

64
00:05:02,816 --> 00:05:05,114
My whole insane jealousy thing?

65
00:05:05,318 --> 00:05:07,912
Well, as much fun as that was...

66
00:05:08,121 --> 00:05:10,453
...I致e decided to opt for sanity.

67
00:05:11,024 --> 00:05:12,685
You're okay about this?

68
00:05:12,859 --> 00:05:15,123
Oh, yeah, come on!
I知 moving on.

69
00:05:15,462 --> 00:05:19,125
He can press her up against
that window all he wants.

70
00:05:19,332 --> 00:05:23,564
For all I care, he can throw her
through the damn thing.

71
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:25,933
Hi, guys.

72
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:30,303
Monica, I値l come by
and pick up Fluffy's old cat toys.

73
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:33,110
Only if you say his full name.

74
00:05:33,313 --> 00:05:38,979
Can I come over tomorrow and pick up
Fluffy Meowington's cat toys?

75
00:05:39,653 --> 00:05:40,677
All right.

76
00:05:40,887 --> 00:05:44,846
-You're getting a cat?
-Actually, we're getting a cat.

77
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:46,822
Together?

78
00:05:46,993 --> 00:05:49,086
Both of you? Together?

79
00:05:49,262 --> 00:05:52,754
It'll live with each of us
half the time.

80
00:05:53,266 --> 00:05:56,099
Well, isn't that just lovely?

81
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,195
That's something you'll enjoy...

82
00:05:59,472 --> 00:06:01,997
...for a really,
really long time.

83
00:06:02,175 --> 00:06:03,767
Hopefully.

84
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,307
Look at that.
I gotta go! I got a date!

85
00:06:07,514 --> 00:06:09,004
With a man.

86
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,348
You guys have a really good night...

87
00:06:12,619 --> 00:06:16,555
...and you two have a really good cat.

88
00:06:21,061 --> 00:06:24,724
We're not supposed to take these
when we leave.

89
00:06:30,303 --> 00:06:35,331
Monica might've mentioned that this
is my first date since my divorce.

90
00:06:35,742 --> 00:06:39,143
If I seem a little nervous, I am.

91
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,446
How long do cats live?

92
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,519
-I知 sorry?
-Cats. How long do they live?

93
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,622
Figuring you don't throw them
under a bus, or something.

94
00:06:51,558 --> 00:06:56,359
-Maybe 15, 16 years.
-Well, that's just great.

95
00:06:57,664 --> 00:06:59,097
Cheers!

96
00:06:59,532 --> 00:07:01,159
Right. Clink.

97
00:07:07,907 --> 00:07:11,809
Monica told you I was cuter
than this, didn't she?

98
00:07:12,278 --> 00:07:15,304
No, Michael, it's not you.

99
00:07:15,515 --> 00:07:18,245
Sorry. It's this thing.

100
00:07:18,518 --> 00:07:20,486
It's not as bad as it sounds...

101
00:07:20,653 --> 00:07:24,453
...but my friend is getting a cat
with his girlfriend.

102
00:07:24,624 --> 00:07:27,218
Oh, that does sound....

103
00:07:29,696 --> 00:07:32,859
He just started going out with her.

104
00:07:33,066 --> 00:07:36,661
Is this guy an old boyfriend?

105
00:07:38,505 --> 00:07:40,700
Yeah, he wishes.

106
00:07:43,076 --> 00:07:44,941
I知 sorry. Look at me.

107
00:07:45,178 --> 00:07:48,875
-Michael, let's talk about you.
-All right.

108
00:07:49,082 --> 00:07:50,743
Okay.

109
00:07:51,284 --> 00:07:52,751
So....

110
00:07:55,054 --> 00:07:58,251
Did you ever get a pet
with a girlfriend?

111
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:02,192
-So I figured it out.
-What?

112
00:08:02,428 --> 00:08:04,828
Why Scott won't sleep with me.

113
00:08:05,031 --> 00:08:07,397
I知 not sexy enough.

114
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,727
Phoebe, that's crazy.

115
00:08:09,936 --> 00:08:12,666
When I first met you,
know what I said?

116
00:08:12,872 --> 00:08:15,932
I said, ''Excellent butt, great rack.''

117
00:08:19,112 --> 00:08:21,910
Really? That's so sweet.

118
00:08:23,483 --> 00:08:27,476
I mean, I知 officially offended.
But that's so sweet.

119
00:08:28,254 --> 00:08:32,691
If you wanna know what the deal is,
you have to ask him.

120
00:08:32,892 --> 00:08:34,826
You're right. You're right.

121
00:08:35,228 --> 00:08:37,423
You are so yum!

122
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:00,886
I mean, it's a cat, you know?
It's a cat.

123
00:09:02,422 --> 00:09:05,721
Why can't they get a bug?
Those fruit flies.

124
00:09:05,925 --> 00:09:10,225
Those things that live for a day.
What are they called?

125
00:09:11,364 --> 00:09:13,696
-Fruit flies?
-Yes!

126
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:15,095
Thank you.

127
00:09:15,301 --> 00:09:18,930
-Would you like dessert?
-No! No dessert.

128
00:09:19,105 --> 00:09:21,403
Just the check. Please.

129
00:09:22,242 --> 00:09:25,268
Oh, no.
You're not having fun, are you?

130
00:09:25,445 --> 00:09:27,003
No, no, I am.

131
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:32,843
But only because I致e been playing
the movie Diner in my head.

132
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,219
Oh, look at me.

133
00:09:35,622 --> 00:09:36,714
Look at me.

134
00:09:36,956 --> 00:09:40,619
I知 on a date
with a really great guy.

135
00:09:40,793 --> 00:09:45,196
All I can think about is Ross,
and his cat...

136
00:09:45,398 --> 00:09:47,366
...and his Julie.

137
00:09:48,234 --> 00:09:50,862
Look, do you want a piece of pie?

138
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,038
No!

139
00:09:54,307 --> 00:09:58,573
Too late for that, man.
I致e screwed this all up.

140
00:09:58,778 --> 00:10:02,339
I just want to get over him.
Why can't I do that?

141
00:10:04,183 --> 00:10:08,051
I致e been through a divorce.
Trust me, you'll be fine.

142
00:10:08,288 --> 00:10:10,984
You just haven't had any closure.

143
00:10:12,325 --> 00:10:13,952
Closure!

144
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,385
That's it!
That's what I need!

145
00:10:16,663 --> 00:10:18,494
God, you're brilliant!

146
00:10:20,566 --> 00:10:24,058
Why didn't I think of that?
How do I get that?

147
00:10:24,804 --> 00:10:28,706
Well, there's no one way, really.

148
00:10:28,975 --> 00:10:32,001
Whatever it takes
so that you can say to him:

149
00:10:32,211 --> 00:10:34,270
''I知 over you.''

150
00:10:34,881 --> 00:10:36,246
Over you.

151
00:10:36,549 --> 00:10:38,278
That's what it is.

152
00:10:39,319 --> 00:10:41,014
Closure.

153
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:44,085
Hello? Excuse me?

154
00:10:44,524 --> 00:10:46,253
Excuse me. Hel--

155
00:10:47,093 --> 00:10:48,287
-Hang on.
-Excuse me?

156
00:10:48,494 --> 00:10:50,189
-What?
-Hi. I知 sorry.

157
00:10:50,396 --> 00:10:53,729
I need to borrow your phone
for one minute.

158
00:10:54,734 --> 00:10:56,099
I知 talking.

159
00:10:56,269 --> 00:11:01,104
One phone call, I値l be very quick.
I値l even pay for it myself.

160
00:11:02,342 --> 00:11:05,800
You're being a little weird
about your phone.

161
00:11:07,947 --> 00:11:10,040
I値l call you back.

162
00:11:12,218 --> 00:11:14,083
Thank you.

163
00:11:15,655 --> 00:11:18,123
I知 so good with people.

164
00:11:23,363 --> 00:11:24,830
Machine.

165
00:11:25,365 --> 00:11:28,095
-Just waiting for the beep.
-Good.

166
00:11:29,235 --> 00:11:32,636
Ross! Hi, it's Rachel.

167
00:11:32,905 --> 00:11:35,465
I知 just calling to say that...

168
00:11:35,675 --> 00:11:39,509
...everything's fine,
and I知 really happy for you.

169
00:11:39,912 --> 00:11:41,777
And your cat.

170
00:11:42,315 --> 00:11:46,445
Who, by the way, I think
you should name Michael.

171
00:11:49,255 --> 00:11:51,689
See, I知 thinking of names...

172
00:11:51,924 --> 00:11:55,257
...so obviously I am over you.

173
00:11:55,528 --> 00:11:58,588
I am over you.

174
00:11:58,865 --> 00:12:04,030
And that, my friend,
is what they call ''closure.''

175
00:12:16,983 --> 00:12:18,974
No, no, no...

176
00:12:19,152 --> 00:12:21,086
...no, no, no!

177
00:12:22,255 --> 00:12:25,383
It's Sunday.
I知 not running on a Sunday.

178
00:12:25,591 --> 00:12:28,219
-Why not?
-Because it's Sunday!

179
00:12:28,761 --> 00:12:30,626
It's God's day.

180
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:35,429
If you say stop, then we stop.

181
00:12:35,968 --> 00:12:36,957
Stop.

182
00:12:37,136 --> 00:12:41,368
Come on, we can't stop!
We got three more pounds to go!

183
00:12:41,574 --> 00:12:44,907
I am the energy train
and you are onboard!

184
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:01,624
Hey, Rach.

185
00:13:04,163 --> 00:13:06,358
And how was the date?

186
00:13:06,532 --> 00:13:09,262
I think there was a restaurant.

187
00:13:09,735 --> 00:13:12,363
I know there was wine.

188
00:13:13,406 --> 00:13:16,603
Well, actually, Julie's getting a cab.

189
00:13:16,843 --> 00:13:20,006
I just need the cat toys.
Did Monica say....

190
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:22,875
Why are you looking at me
like that?

191
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,475
I知 sorry. I don't know, l....

192
00:13:26,018 --> 00:13:28,316
I think I had a dream
about you...

193
00:13:28,588 --> 00:13:31,022
...but I don't remember.

194
00:13:31,757 --> 00:13:33,588
Okay.

195
00:13:34,694 --> 00:13:36,753
There they are.

196
00:13:37,463 --> 00:13:39,693
Did you call me last night?

197
00:13:39,966 --> 00:13:43,402
No. I stayed at Julie's last night.

198
00:13:44,137 --> 00:13:47,971
I haven't been home yet.
Can I check my messages?

199
00:13:48,141 --> 00:13:49,938
Oh, yeah, go ahead.

200
00:13:53,713 --> 00:13:56,705
Rach, I got a message from you!

201
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,280
-Who's Michael?
-Oh, my God!

202
00:14:03,523 --> 00:14:06,617
Hang up the phone.
Give me the phone!

203
00:14:08,995 --> 00:14:10,326
Give me the--

204
00:14:16,302 --> 00:14:18,031
You're over me?

205
00:14:18,337 --> 00:14:20,532
Oh, God!

206
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,831
-You're--
-Oh, God.

207
00:14:23,042 --> 00:14:24,907
You're over me?

208
00:14:29,282 --> 00:14:32,718
When were you...

209
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:35,183
...under me?

210
00:14:38,691 --> 00:14:39,919
Rach.

211
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:41,760
Rachel, do you...?

212
00:14:42,495 --> 00:14:44,360
I mean, were you?

213
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,221
-What?
-Okay, okay.

214
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:52,869
Basically, lately, I致e....

215
00:14:54,373 --> 00:14:57,433
I致e sort of had feelings for you.

216
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,243
You've had feelings for me?

217
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:07,682
So? You had feelings for me first!

218
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:13,252
You know about my--
You know I had--

219
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:14,949
You know?

220
00:15:16,662 --> 00:15:20,393
-Chandler told me.
-When did he? When did he?

221
00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:25,037
When you were in China.

222
00:15:25,204 --> 00:15:27,104
Meeting Julie.

223
00:15:27,306 --> 00:15:30,139
Julie. That's--
Oh, God!

224
00:15:32,645 --> 00:15:34,977
I need to lie down.

225
00:15:35,314 --> 00:15:38,613
No, I知 gonna stand.
I知 gonna stand...

226
00:15:38,784 --> 00:15:42,015
...and I知 gonna walk.
I知 walking and standing.

227
00:15:42,221 --> 00:15:45,213
So you--
And now, now....

228
00:15:46,158 --> 00:15:48,649
Now you're over me?

229
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:52,991
Are you over me?

230
00:16:01,274 --> 00:16:03,765
That's Julie.

231
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:08,473
-Hi, Julie.
-I've got a cab waiting.

232
00:16:08,681 --> 00:16:11,081
I値l be right down!

233
00:16:14,587 --> 00:16:16,145
Wait, so you're going?

234
00:16:16,322 --> 00:16:19,951
Well, I have to.
I can't deal with this right now.

235
00:16:20,226 --> 00:16:24,287
I mean, I致e got a cab.
I致e got a girlfriend.

236
00:16:24,497 --> 00:16:26,829
I知 gonna go get a cat.

237
00:16:30,336 --> 00:16:31,633
Cat!

238
00:16:48,321 --> 00:16:50,414
-Hey, Joey.
-Hey, Pheebs.

239
00:16:52,158 --> 00:16:56,151
How come you're watching
a rabbi play electric guitar?

240
00:16:56,696 --> 00:16:59,494
I can't find the remote.

241
00:17:02,201 --> 00:17:03,532
Thank you.

242
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:08,531
Scott asked me to come over
for lunch and I did.

243
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,539
And we did.

244
00:17:10,776 --> 00:17:14,143
-All right! Way to go!
-Yay, me!

245
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,841
So how did it happen?

246
00:17:17,016 --> 00:17:19,917
I finally asked him what was going on.

247
00:17:20,086 --> 00:17:21,246
What did he say?

248
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:25,322
He understands how sex can be
very emotional for a woman.

249
00:17:25,524 --> 00:17:28,721
He was afraid
that I was going to get all:

250
00:17:28,928 --> 00:17:32,455
''Will he call me the next day?
Where is this going?''

251
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,528
He said he wanted to hold off
until he was ready to be serious.

252
00:17:39,739 --> 00:17:40,967
-Wow.
-Yeah.

253
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,769
So I said, ''Okay. Relax, please.''

254
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:50,415
Sex can be just about two people
in the moment.

255
00:17:50,616 --> 00:17:54,643
If he wants to see me again,
he can call. If not, fine.

256
00:17:55,054 --> 00:17:58,820
So after a lot of talking...

257
00:18:00,493 --> 00:18:02,688
...I convinced him.

258
00:18:06,132 --> 00:18:11,001
Let me get this straight.
He got you to beg to sleep with him.

259
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:14,933
He got you to say
he never has to call you again.

260
00:18:15,141 --> 00:18:18,872
And he got you thinking
this is a great idea?

261
00:18:22,915 --> 00:18:25,076
This man is my God!

262
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,323
Oh, this one's cute.

263
00:18:34,527 --> 00:18:37,462
Yeah, and this one, and that one.

264
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:41,566
They're all cute. They're kittens.
Just wrap one up.

265
00:18:42,435 --> 00:18:44,130
-You okay?
-Yeah, me?

266
00:18:44,303 --> 00:18:47,170
Yeah, yeah. Yeah?

267
00:18:48,073 --> 00:18:50,405
Ross, honey. Hey.

268
00:18:50,609 --> 00:18:55,239
I know this is a big step,
but I think we'll be okay.

269
00:18:56,749 --> 00:18:59,047
Yeah, I know. I know.

270
00:18:59,385 --> 00:19:03,845
So do you have any cats that are
really old or incredibly sick?

271
00:19:06,192 --> 00:19:08,786
I don't want one that's about to die.

272
00:19:08,961 --> 00:19:12,897
We should've worked that out
before we came down here.

273
00:19:13,098 --> 00:19:14,190
Okay, sweetie.

274
00:19:14,366 --> 00:19:17,392
I値l narrow it down
to this one here...

275
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,970
...and this one with the stripes.

276
00:19:20,172 --> 00:19:21,264
You pick.

277
00:19:21,574 --> 00:19:23,940
Whoa, hey, I have to pick?

278
00:19:24,109 --> 00:19:26,304
Yeah, whichever one you want.

279
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,405
Well, I don't know.

280
00:19:30,616 --> 00:19:32,743
It's not that easy to choose.

281
00:19:32,952 --> 00:19:37,150
Both cats are beautiful...

282
00:19:39,258 --> 00:19:41,226
...and funny.

283
00:19:43,963 --> 00:19:47,364
I知 sure I壇 be happy with either cat.

284
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:51,334
-Well, do you want to take both?
-Both? Both!?

285
00:19:51,537 --> 00:19:54,973
I can't have two cats!

286
00:19:56,242 --> 00:19:59,871
Joey's the kind of guys
who could have two cats.

287
00:20:03,782 --> 00:20:05,716
Goodnight, Gunther.

288
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:17,354
-Hi.
-I didn't get a cat.

289
00:20:18,597 --> 00:20:21,657
Oh, that's interesting.

290
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:25,770
No, it's not interesting.
It's very not interesting.

291
00:20:25,971 --> 00:20:28,940
It's actually 100%
the opposite of interesting.

292
00:20:29,108 --> 00:20:30,439
I got it, Ross.

293
00:20:30,609 --> 00:20:34,409
You had no right to tell me
you had feelings for me.

294
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,242
I was doing great before I knew!

295
00:20:37,483 --> 00:20:39,314
I was doing great too!

296
00:20:39,585 --> 00:20:41,951
It's hard to see you with Julie.

297
00:20:42,121 --> 00:20:44,214
You should've said so before!

298
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:47,689
I didn't know!
How come you never said anything?

299
00:20:47,893 --> 00:20:49,588
There wasn't a good time.

300
00:20:49,762 --> 00:20:53,163
You had a year.
And we only hung out every night!

301
00:20:53,332 --> 00:20:55,266
Not...

302
00:20:55,501 --> 00:20:57,662
...every night.

303
00:20:58,304 --> 00:21:01,967
It's not like I didn't try.
Things got in the way.

304
00:21:02,174 --> 00:21:06,201
Like Italian guys,
or ex-fiances...

305
00:21:07,012 --> 00:21:09,344
...or Italian guys.

306
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:14,779
There was one Italian guy.
Do you have a point?

307
00:21:14,954 --> 00:21:17,787
The point is,
I don't need this now!

308
00:21:17,957 --> 00:21:19,720
Okay? It's too late.

309
00:21:19,892 --> 00:21:22,884
I知 with someone else.
This ship has sailed!

310
00:21:23,062 --> 00:21:26,293
You're gonna put away
your feelings for me?

311
00:21:26,465 --> 00:21:29,127
I致e done it since ninth grade.

312
00:21:29,301 --> 00:21:31,792
All right.
Go ahead and do that.

313
00:21:31,971 --> 00:21:34,371
-I don't need your ship!
-Good!

314
00:21:35,975 --> 00:21:39,001
And you know what?
Now I got closure!

315
00:22:31,697 --> 00:22:33,255
Try the bottom one.

316
00:23:00,726 --> 00:23:04,162
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning.

317
00:23:04,463 --> 00:23:07,023
We're not working out.
It's over.

318
00:23:07,566 --> 00:23:10,000
With one pound to go?
Come on!

319
00:23:10,235 --> 00:23:13,898
We're working, we're moving,
we're grooving!

320
00:23:15,007 --> 00:23:17,066
I don't mind the last pound.

321
00:23:17,276 --> 00:23:19,904
In fact, I kind of like the last pound.

322
00:23:21,146 --> 00:23:23,876
Don't make me do anything I値l regret.

323
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:27,448
What you gonna do, fat boy?

324
00:23:28,353 --> 00:23:29,411
What?

325
00:23:31,356 --> 00:23:35,759
Nothing. Except say it's wonderful
how much energy you have.

326
00:23:36,228 --> 00:23:37,889
Well, thanks.

327
00:23:38,063 --> 00:23:41,624
Especially with how tough
it's been to find work.

328
00:23:42,267 --> 00:23:44,098
Well, you know....

329
00:23:45,771 --> 00:23:51,334
You can't tell your parents you were
fired, because they'd be disappointed.

330
00:23:53,378 --> 00:23:58,077
It's not as if you have
a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.

331
00:23:58,884 --> 00:24:00,511
Well, no, but l....

332
00:24:00,953 --> 00:24:05,947
If it were me, I壇 have difficulty
getting out of bed at all.

333
00:24:10,796 --> 00:24:13,560
You know, I try to stay positive.

334
00:24:13,966 --> 00:24:15,263
So...

335
00:24:16,034 --> 00:24:19,197
...you feel like going for a run?

336
00:24:21,273 --> 00:24:22,740
All right.

337
00:24:22,908 --> 00:24:28,107
Because you don't have to.
You could just take a nap right here.

338
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:31,415
Okay.

339
00:24:32,184 --> 00:24:34,948
-Just for a little while.
-Okay.
