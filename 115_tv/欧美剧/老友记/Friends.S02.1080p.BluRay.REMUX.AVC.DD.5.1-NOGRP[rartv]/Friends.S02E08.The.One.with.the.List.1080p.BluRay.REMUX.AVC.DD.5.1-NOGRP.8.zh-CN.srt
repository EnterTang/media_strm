You've agreed to testify, and you know that your immunity

Is it true that you left your family?

Answer the question, Mr. Parks.

and tell me what time it is? Oh, wait. I know.

She caught me off guard.

I want to keep her around. She pays well.

Okay, so here's the deal. Um...

Evan was just gonna take Katie to the daddy-daughter dance

because I didn't know that you were gonna be home.

Oh, I get it.

00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:49,607
You are keeping this dirty, little secret

all to yourself.

781
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,643
Well, didn't anyone ever tell you

782
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:54,277
you can't bury past sins?

783
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:57,080
I'm not afraid to bury more than that.

784
00:36:57,115 --> 00:37:01,151
You come back here again, you're gonna find that out.

785

to get enough of those strong hands of yours.

Lisa, we need to talk.

790
00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:26,644
Something tells me you're not about to invite me

791
00:37:26,678 --> 00:37:30,848
on a romantic weekend to South Padre Island.

792
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:32,683
I am sorry, but you pay me for an hour

793
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:34,117
to make you feel good.

794

[ Sighs ]

The divorce is just making me so sad.

798
00:37:49,034 --> 00:37:52,036
I was only looking for a distraction.

799

[ Sighs ] Don't cry, please.

801

I wasn't trying to be harsh.

00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:02,646
Hey.

803
00:38:02,681 --> 00:38:04,848
I mean, if we'd met under different circumstances,

804

I'm sure we'd be great.

Will you accept the watch?

Thanks.

812
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:33,844

Parts. And?

He doesn't even know everything

824

'cause he can't know everything.

825
