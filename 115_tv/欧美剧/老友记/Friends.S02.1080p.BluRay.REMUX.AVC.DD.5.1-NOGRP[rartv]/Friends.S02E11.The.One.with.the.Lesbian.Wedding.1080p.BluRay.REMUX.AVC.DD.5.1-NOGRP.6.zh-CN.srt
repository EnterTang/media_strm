1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:07,858
Okay, here's his diaper bag
and his Mr. Winky.

2
00:00:08,496 --> 00:00:10,291
And...

3
00:00:11,063 --> 00:00:12,757
...him. Hi!

4
00:00:13,363 --> 00:00:15,523
- How did everything go?
- Great!

5
00:00:15,731 --> 00:00:20,926
There was a projectile throwing up
incident, but he started it.

6
00:00:22,099 --> 00:00:23,929
We've gotta go.

7
00:00:24,934 --> 00:00:26,628
Oh, right.

8
00:00:26,801 --> 00:00:29,199
I've got some news.
It's about us.

9
00:00:29,435 --> 00:00:32,459
- You and me?
- No. Susan and me.

10
00:00:32,636 --> 00:00:34,398
The other "us."

11
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,100
We're getting married.

12
00:00:46,107 --> 00:00:49,699
As in, "I now pronounce you
wife and wife" married?

13
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:54,206
We'd like you to come.
We understand if you don't want to.

14
00:00:54,443 --> 00:00:58,536
Why wouldn't I want to come?
I had fun at the first wedding.

15
00:00:59,612 --> 00:01:01,044
I just thought that...

16
00:01:01,279 --> 00:01:05,770
Why shouldn't I be happy for you?
What would it say about me...

17
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,038
...if I couldn't revel
in your joy?

18
00:01:09,248 --> 00:01:11,714
And I'm reveling, baby!
Believe me!

19
00:01:12,249 --> 00:01:15,739
Is your finger caught in that chair?

20
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:19,008
Want us to go?

21
00:01:20,618 --> 00:01:22,778
The One With the Lesbian Wedding

22
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,199
This is cool.
You're actually on television.

23
00:02:11,368 --> 00:02:17,530
I know. It really hit me last night.
I'm gonna be on Days of Our Lives.

24
00:02:17,703 --> 00:02:23,297
Then I started thinking about us,
and how these are the days of our lives.

25
00:02:25,038 --> 00:02:26,834
- Yes!
- What?

26
00:02:27,006 --> 00:02:30,269
Carol and Susan's caterer
had a bike accident...

27
00:02:30,474 --> 00:02:32,997
...and she's in a full-body cast.

28
00:02:33,774 --> 00:02:35,638
Yes!

29
00:02:36,042 --> 00:02:39,373
They asked me, which is cool
since I've never catered...

30
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,009
...and I need money.
Is this a problem?

31
00:02:42,244 --> 00:02:45,768
- Would it matter?
- You're so great! Thank you!

32
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:48,571
- You're really not going?
- I'm really not.

33
00:02:48,779 --> 00:02:52,645
They already live together.
Why do they need to get married?

34
00:02:52,814 --> 00:02:54,280
They love each other.

35
00:02:54,481 --> 00:02:58,574
They wanna celebrate that love
with the people close to them.

36
00:02:58,749 --> 00:03:01,580
If you wanna call that a reason.

37
00:03:02,117 --> 00:03:05,710
Who's the bitterest man
In the living room?

38
00:03:06,151 --> 00:03:08,710
The bitterest man
In the living room?

39
00:03:10,053 --> 00:03:11,882
Hi, neighbor.

40
00:03:13,554 --> 00:03:17,681
- I thought you were over this.
- That has nothing to do with it.

41
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:21,515
If she were marrying a guy,
you wouldn't expect me to go.

42
00:03:21,724 --> 00:03:26,249
If she were marrying a guy,
she'd be the worst lesbian ever.

43
00:03:28,492 --> 00:03:29,890
Did I miss it?

44
00:03:30,093 --> 00:03:33,527
No, I'm on right after this guy
shoots himself.

45
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,227
She's pretty.

46
00:03:36,395 --> 00:03:40,920
And she's nice. She taught me
about how to work with the cameras...

47
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:43,858
...and smell-the-fart acting.

48
00:03:46,064 --> 00:03:48,553
- I'm sorry, what?
- Excuse me?

49
00:03:48,732 --> 00:03:51,199
Smell-the-fart acting.

50
00:03:51,933 --> 00:03:55,264
You got so many lines
to learn that sometimes...

51
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,399
...you need a minute
to remember your next.

52
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:00,330
So while you're thinking...

53
00:04:00,502 --> 00:04:03,992
...you take this big pause
where you look all intense.

54
00:04:04,204 --> 00:04:05,932
Like this...

55
00:04:12,339 --> 00:04:14,704
Here's my scene!
Here's my scene!

56
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,564
Mrs. Wallace?

57
00:04:18,742 --> 00:04:21,334
Dr. Drake Ramoray,
your sister's neurosurgeon.

58
00:04:21,576 --> 00:04:23,667
Is she going to be all right?

59
00:04:23,876 --> 00:04:27,776
I'm afraid the situation is
much more dire than we'd expected.

60
00:04:27,944 --> 00:04:30,810
Your sister's suffering from a...

61
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,203
...subcranial hematoma.

62
00:04:40,048 --> 00:04:43,914
Perhaps we can discuss this
further over coffee.

63
00:04:50,084 --> 00:04:51,482
Nice!

64
00:04:52,885 --> 00:04:56,785
For a minute, I thought you were
actually smelling something.

65
00:04:59,087 --> 00:05:00,519
- Again!
- All right!

66
00:05:00,721 --> 00:05:02,950
- That was so good!
- Do it again.

67
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:07,254
Damn it, Braverman!
It's right there on the chart!

68
00:05:08,357 --> 00:05:12,313
I gotta get to work.
I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.

69
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:15,959
- No, no, that's me.
- Oh, right.

70
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:22,255
Oh, thanks. Couldn't...

71
00:05:24,262 --> 00:05:26,694
- Is everything okay?
- No.

72
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:33,028
One of my clients died
on the massage table today.

73
00:05:33,265 --> 00:05:34,925
Oh, my God!

74
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:38,258
That's a little more relaxed
than you want them.

75
00:05:40,701 --> 00:05:43,566
She was, you know,
82 years old...

76
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:46,930
...and her name was
Mrs. Adelman.

77
00:05:47,136 --> 00:05:50,763
- Oh, honey.
- It's just so strange.

78
00:05:50,971 --> 00:05:53,699
She probably woke up today
and thought...

79
00:05:53,872 --> 00:05:57,703
...l'll have breakfast,
take a walk, then have my massage.

80
00:05:57,873 --> 00:06:02,239
Little did she know God was thinking,
"Okay, but that's it."

81
00:06:04,775 --> 00:06:07,537
Oh, but the weirdest thing was...

82
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,971
...I was cleansing her aura
when it happened.

83
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:17,167
And when her spirit left her body,
I don't think it went very far.

84
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:21,710
- What do you mean?
- I think it went into me.

85
00:06:30,483 --> 00:06:34,007
This is so hard.
I can't decide between lamb or duck.

86
00:06:34,184 --> 00:06:35,878
Lambs are scarier.

87
00:06:36,118 --> 00:06:39,881
Or the movie would have been called
Silence of the Ducks.

88
00:06:41,087 --> 00:06:42,712
Okay, who ordered what?

89
00:06:42,887 --> 00:06:47,583
I had the half-drunk cappuccino
with the lipstick on the rim.

90
00:06:47,755 --> 00:06:51,052
This with the cigarette butt
in it, that's decaf?

91
00:06:51,257 --> 00:06:52,883
Oh, God.

92
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,216
You're so uptight
about your mom coming.

93
00:06:55,425 --> 00:06:57,983
I just don't want her to think that...

94
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:01,456
...because I didn't marry Barry,
my life is crap.

95
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,491
Talk about crap,
listen to Stella Neidman...

96
00:07:04,727 --> 00:07:09,457
...tell her story about Rod Steiger
for the hundredth time.

97
00:07:12,863 --> 00:07:18,525
I'm sorry. At least you guys don't
have to hear what she says in my head.

98
00:07:20,533 --> 00:07:25,159
Pheebs? How long do you think
this lady will be with us?

99
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,834
I don't know. She obviously
has unfinished business.

100
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:30,626
Sit up!

101
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,600
There she is!

102
00:07:34,837 --> 00:07:37,326
- Mom!
- Hey, sweetie!

103
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:45,466
So this is where you work!

104
00:07:45,641 --> 00:07:47,800
Oh, it's wonderful!

105
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:52,372
Is it a living room?
Is it a restaurant? Who can tell?

106
00:07:52,543 --> 00:07:54,305
I guess that's the fun.

107
00:07:54,476 --> 00:07:56,534
Pretty much.
Meet my friends.

108
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,643
Monica! You look gorgeous!

109
00:07:59,845 --> 00:08:04,074
Oh, my! The last time I saw you,
it was eat or be eaten.

110
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:09,174
This is Joey, this is Phoebe,
and this is Chandler.

111
00:08:09,347 --> 00:08:11,940
- You remember Ross?
- Oh, hello, Ross.

112
00:08:12,115 --> 00:08:13,604
Mrs. Gree...

113
00:08:15,616 --> 00:08:20,050
What do you think of my daughter,
in the apron with the big job?

114
00:08:20,452 --> 00:08:22,577
Oh, Mom!

115
00:08:23,052 --> 00:08:27,782
If you didn't pour the coffee,
no one would have anything to drink.

116
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,779
Believe me, sometimes that happens.

117
00:08:32,788 --> 00:08:36,278
This is just so exciting!
You know, I never worked.

118
00:08:36,457 --> 00:08:39,856
I went from my father's house
to a sorority house...

119
00:08:40,024 --> 00:08:43,583
...to my husband's house.
I am just so proud of you!

120
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:47,281
- Really?
- Yes. Let's make a day of it.

121
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:52,019
We'll have lunch, shop, get our nails
done. Whatever you want.

122
00:08:52,195 --> 00:08:54,627
I have to work.

123
00:08:54,795 --> 00:08:58,092
What, no one else can pour coffee?

124
00:08:58,263 --> 00:09:01,923
I know who it is you remind me of.
Evelyn Durmer.

125
00:09:02,164 --> 00:09:07,497
That's before the lousy face-lift.
Now she looks like Soupy Sales.

126
00:09:10,601 --> 00:09:13,090
Pheebs, who's Evelyn Durmer?

127
00:09:14,368 --> 00:09:17,494
I don't know.
Who's Soupy Sales?

128
00:09:19,436 --> 00:09:20,902
Oh, my God!

129
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:25,095
There's an unattractive
nude man playing the cello.

130
00:09:25,905 --> 00:09:30,134
Just be glad he's not playing
a smaller instrument.

131
00:09:33,007 --> 00:09:35,167
You have some life here, sweetie!

132
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:38,866
I realize you were upset
when I didn't marry Barry...

133
00:09:39,076 --> 00:09:42,703
...and get a house in the suburbs
with all the security.

134
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,934
This is so much better for me.

135
00:09:45,178 --> 00:09:49,111
I know.
You didn't love Barry, honey.

136
00:09:49,346 --> 00:09:51,904
And I've never seen you this happy.

137
00:09:52,114 --> 00:09:56,548
I look at you and I think,
"This is what I want."

138
00:09:57,748 --> 00:09:59,408
For me.

139
00:10:00,383 --> 00:10:04,077
- Well, not just for you.
- What do you mean?

140
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:09,344
I'm considering
leaving your father.

141
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,677
All right, tell me
if this is too cute.

142
00:10:14,855 --> 00:10:18,515
Lesbian wedding...
chicken breasts.

143
00:10:21,723 --> 00:10:24,781
Oh, God.
I think I'm gonna be sick.

144
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:28,889
What? It's not like I'm putting
little nipples on them.

145
00:10:30,626 --> 00:10:35,992
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
Please don't be mad at me.

146
00:10:36,161 --> 00:10:37,752
What can I do?

147
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:42,328
You want me to make those
marshmallow treats you used to like?

148
00:10:42,497 --> 00:10:46,294
I can call up Carmela
and find out how.

149
00:10:46,664 --> 00:10:49,597
I don't understand.
I thought you were happy.

150
00:10:49,765 --> 00:10:52,323
Yeah, well, so did I.

151
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,763
Know how sometimes
you're driving on the highway...

152
00:10:55,934 --> 00:11:01,197
...and you get home and you can't
remember having driven there?

153
00:11:01,402 --> 00:11:03,925
That's what my life's been like.

154
00:11:04,103 --> 00:11:07,730
Well, couldn't you listen
to the radio more?

155
00:11:08,171 --> 00:11:11,332
I wish it were that easy.
Then I see you...

156
00:11:11,506 --> 00:11:14,496
...and I think,
"Why can't I have this?"

157
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:19,300
I want adventures, I want
to hang out, I want a Chandler.

158
00:11:21,142 --> 00:11:27,270
Mom, believe me, Chandler is
no reason to leave Daddy.

159
00:11:27,477 --> 00:11:32,036
You think I'm having fun,
but it's really hard. Really hard.

160
00:11:32,212 --> 00:11:37,578
I've got a lousy job, I barely make
rent, and forget about buying stuff!

161
00:11:37,747 --> 00:11:40,737
Oh, honey, you don't understand.

162
00:11:40,915 --> 00:11:45,076
I'd be doing what you're doing,
but with money.

163
00:11:46,016 --> 00:11:49,006
It's very different.

164
00:11:53,086 --> 00:11:55,552
- You had no idea?
- None.

165
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,277
They didn't fight a lot?

166
00:11:57,454 --> 00:12:00,182
No, they didn't even talk
to each other.

167
00:12:00,388 --> 00:12:04,253
How was I supposed to know
they were having problems?

168
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:09,054
You know, in my day,
divorce was not an option.

169
00:12:09,258 --> 00:12:11,622
Hey, look who's up!

170
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:16,051
I just can't believe
this is happening!

171
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,022
When I was little,
all parents got divorced.

172
00:12:19,194 --> 00:12:22,355
I figured as an adult,
I wouldn't have to worry.

173
00:12:22,528 --> 00:12:27,690
Can't you look at this as flattering?
She wants to be more like you.

174
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:32,227
Well, then, couldn't she have
just copied my haircut?

175
00:12:32,398 --> 00:12:35,263
When my parents divorced,
I went to a shrink...

176
00:12:35,466 --> 00:12:38,524
...and she told me
that kids blame themselves.

177
00:12:38,766 --> 00:12:41,665
But in your case,
it's actually kind of true.

178
00:12:42,301 --> 00:12:43,733
Oh, that's him.

179
00:12:44,601 --> 00:12:48,399
Damn! My mail-order
grandfather hasn't come yet.

180
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:50,629
- Phoebe?
- Hi, Mr. Adelman.

181
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:52,895
- Nice to see you.
- Thanks for coming.

182
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:58,129
That's okay. Although you did
cut into my busy day of sitting.

183
00:12:58,973 --> 00:13:00,439
Do you wanna sit?

184
00:13:00,606 --> 00:13:05,063
No, I spent most of midmorning
trying to stand up.

185
00:13:05,975 --> 00:13:07,964
What can I do for you, dear?

186
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:11,199
Okay, I don't know
how to say this...

187
00:13:11,377 --> 00:13:15,209
...but I think when your wife's spirit
left her body...

188
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:18,107
...it kind of stuck around in me.

189
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:21,109
You're saying my wife is in you?

190
00:13:21,914 --> 00:13:24,403
Yeah. You don't have
to believe me...

191
00:13:24,614 --> 00:13:27,911
...but can you think of
any unfinished business she had?

192
00:13:28,116 --> 00:13:30,082
Any reason to hang around?

193
00:13:30,316 --> 00:13:34,273
I don't know what to say.
All I can think of is that...

194
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,612
...she said that before she died,
she wanted to see everything.

195
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:41,549
- Everything?
- Everything.

196
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:44,743
- That's a lot of stuff.
- Oh, wait, I...

197
00:13:44,954 --> 00:13:49,945
I remember she also said she wanted
to sleep with me one last time.

198
00:13:57,891 --> 00:14:02,053
I'm sorry.
There's laughing in my head.

199
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:06,152
Worth a shot, huh?

200
00:14:10,896 --> 00:14:13,488
Look at this!

201
00:14:14,063 --> 00:14:17,792
- These are Halloween, three years ago.
- My little martini.

202
00:14:17,965 --> 00:14:21,193
I love your olive head.

203
00:14:21,365 --> 00:14:25,662
Oh, and look, here's Barry.
Did he come straight from work?

204
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,357
Oh, no. That was his costume.

205
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:35,098
See, he's actually an orthodontist,
but he came as a regular dentist.

206
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:38,567
Yeah, he thought
that was really funny.

207
00:14:38,771 --> 00:14:42,967
You guys? Remember when I said
before I don't need your help?

208
00:14:43,172 --> 00:14:48,334
Actually, you said, "Don't touch that
and get the hell out of my kitchen."

209
00:14:48,508 --> 00:14:51,634
Really? Weird. Anyway...

210
00:14:51,942 --> 00:14:54,535
I planned well.
I planned and planned.

211
00:14:54,943 --> 00:14:57,672
I just didn't plan
enough time to do it.

212
00:14:58,144 --> 00:15:00,770
- You want some help?
- Lf you want.

213
00:15:05,646 --> 00:15:08,772
What a day!
I took her everywhere.

214
00:15:11,782 --> 00:15:16,478
The Museum of Modern Art,
Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.

215
00:15:16,717 --> 00:15:18,047
She's still with you?

216
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:22,843
Yes. I guess she hasn't
seen everything yet.

217
00:15:23,018 --> 00:15:26,816
Be right back. She has to go
to the bathroom again.

218
00:15:28,254 --> 00:15:31,415
Such a pretty face!

219
00:15:34,156 --> 00:15:37,645
Oh, this is so much fun!
Just the girls!

220
00:15:37,856 --> 00:15:41,620
You know what we should do?
Does anybody have marijuana?

221
00:15:41,824 --> 00:15:43,586
God!

222
00:15:44,892 --> 00:15:48,223
Did my mother just ask if we have pot?

223
00:15:48,427 --> 00:15:51,588
Look, no one's smoking pot
around all this food.

224
00:15:51,795 --> 00:15:53,761
Well, that's fine.

225
00:15:53,928 --> 00:15:57,726
I never did it.
I just thought I might.

226
00:15:58,797 --> 00:16:01,161
So, what's new in sex?

227
00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:04,764
What's new in sex?

228
00:16:04,932 --> 00:16:07,398
I've only been with your father.

229
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:10,897
I'm dicing. I'm dicing.
I don't hear anything.

230
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:15,933
This is no offense to your dad, but
I was thinking there might be more.

231
00:16:16,102 --> 00:16:19,501
I'm sorry. I can't have
this conversation with you.

232
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,658
All right.

233
00:16:20,837 --> 00:16:24,895
You come here and drop this bomb
on me before you tell Daddy.

234
00:16:25,172 --> 00:16:28,764
Do you want my blessing?
Want me to talk you out of it?

235
00:16:28,939 --> 00:16:32,896
- Then what do you want?
- I guess I figured you'd understand.

236
00:16:33,107 --> 00:16:35,574
Why on earth would I
understand this?

237
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:39,503
You didn't marry your Barry, honey.

238
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:42,506
But I married mine.

239
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:52,235
We're in trouble. We only have
12 hours and 36 minutes left.

240
00:16:52,413 --> 00:16:53,902
Move, move, move!

241
00:16:54,448 --> 00:16:58,643
Monica, I feel like you should
have German subtitles.

242
00:16:59,616 --> 00:17:00,946
Joey, speed it up!

243
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:05,845
I'm sorry! It's the pigs!
They're reluctant to get in the blanket!

244
00:17:06,418 --> 00:17:09,680
How did this happen?
You had this all planned out.

245
00:17:10,253 --> 00:17:12,685
Do you want me to cry?

246
00:17:13,087 --> 00:17:17,077
Is that what you want?
Do you wanna see me cry?

247
00:17:17,388 --> 00:17:18,718
Sir, no, sir!

248
00:17:22,457 --> 00:17:23,548
All right, you!

249
00:17:23,724 --> 00:17:27,418
No. Look, I told you,
I am not a part of this thing.

250
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:32,025
I know you have issues with Carol
and Susan, and I feel for you.

251
00:17:32,226 --> 00:17:35,284
But if you don't help,
I'll take those hot dogs...

252
00:17:35,527 --> 00:17:38,756
...and create an appetizer
called "Pigs In Ross."

253
00:17:39,562 --> 00:17:41,028
Ball a melon!

254
00:17:41,263 --> 00:17:45,492
How come I'm stuck dicing
when he gets to ball a melon?

255
00:17:49,565 --> 00:17:52,396
- How's it going?
- Great! Right on schedule.

256
00:17:52,633 --> 00:17:55,395
Got my little happy helpers.

257
00:17:56,434 --> 00:17:58,866
That's fine. Whatever.

258
00:17:59,035 --> 00:18:01,263
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

259
00:18:02,869 --> 00:18:07,098
Okay, everything.
I think we're calling off the wedding.

260
00:18:07,604 --> 00:18:10,469
You're still gonna pay me, right?

261
00:18:11,772 --> 00:18:14,398
Or something a little less selfish.

262
00:18:14,573 --> 00:18:16,631
What's the matter?
What happened?

263
00:18:16,807 --> 00:18:20,137
- My parents said they weren't coming.
- Oh, my God.

264
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:23,707
I knew they were having
trouble with this...

265
00:18:23,943 --> 00:18:28,206
...but they're my parents.
They're supposed to give me away.

266
00:18:28,411 --> 00:18:32,242
Susan and I fought because
I said maybe we should call it off.

267
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:35,469
She said, "This isn't for them.
It's for us."

268
00:18:35,713 --> 00:18:39,441
And if I couldn't see that,
maybe we should call it off.

269
00:18:39,614 --> 00:18:41,944
I don't know what to do.

270
00:18:43,382 --> 00:18:48,146
I can't believe I'm gonna say this,
but I think Susan's right.

271
00:18:48,317 --> 00:18:49,783
You do?

272
00:18:49,951 --> 00:18:53,975
Do you love her? And don't be
too emphatic about this.

273
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:57,216
Of course I do.

274
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:59,047
Well, then, that's it.

275
00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:04,745
And if George and Adelaide can't
accept that, then the hell with them.

276
00:19:04,956 --> 00:19:08,320
If my parents didn't want me
to marry you...

277
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:11,457
...no way that would have stopped me.

278
00:19:11,624 --> 00:19:16,081
Look, this is your wedding.
Do it.

279
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,549
You're right. Of course you're right.

280
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:22,120
So we're back on?

281
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:23,887
We're back on.

282
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:27,391
You heard the woman!
Peel! Chop! Devil!

283
00:19:29,096 --> 00:19:31,927
Can't believe I lost two minutes!

284
00:19:42,134 --> 00:19:43,828
It just seems so futile.

285
00:19:44,001 --> 00:19:48,128
You know?
All these women, and nothing!

286
00:19:50,237 --> 00:19:54,295
I feel like Superman
without my powers, you know?

287
00:19:54,471 --> 00:19:58,962
I have the cape,
and yet I cannot fly.

288
00:20:00,307 --> 00:20:05,003
Well, now you understand
how I feel every single day. Okay?

289
00:20:05,175 --> 00:20:09,108
The world is my lesbian wedding.

290
00:20:19,346 --> 00:20:20,676
Butterscotch?

291
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:26,437
No one?
All right, you'll be sorry later.

292
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:03,857
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

293
00:21:06,361 --> 00:21:07,349
Ross.

294
00:21:12,263 --> 00:21:14,127
Nothing makes God happier...

295
00:21:14,296 --> 00:21:18,128
...than when two people,
any two, come together in love.

296
00:21:18,931 --> 00:21:21,524
Friends, family,
we're gathered here...

297
00:21:21,699 --> 00:21:24,666
...to join Carol and Susan
in holy matrimony.

298
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,163
Oh, my God!

299
00:21:26,334 --> 00:21:29,028
Now I've seen everything!

300
00:21:32,135 --> 00:21:33,601
She's gone!

301
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:35,998
She's gone! She's gone.

302
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:39,296
Go ahead, get married.
Go, go!

303
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:52,699
- Would you look at them?
- Yeah. Can't help but.

304
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:01,475
How's that pig in a blanket
working out for you?

305
00:22:01,645 --> 00:22:04,407
I wrapped those bad boys.

306
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,673
- I miss Rose.
- Oh, yeah?

307
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,746
I know it's kind of weird,
but she was a big part of my life.

308
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:15,348
I don't know, I feel alone.

309
00:22:15,516 --> 00:22:20,313
You know, I couldn't help
overhearing what you just said.

310
00:22:20,918 --> 00:22:25,716
I think it's time for you to forget
about Rose, move on with your life.

311
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:30,512
- How about we get you a drink?
- Okay. So nice!

312
00:22:37,457 --> 00:22:41,083
I shouldn't even bother
coming up with a line, right?

313
00:22:43,624 --> 00:22:45,352
Hey, Mom, you having fun?

314
00:22:45,525 --> 00:22:50,619
Am I! I just danced
with a wonderfully large woman.

315
00:22:50,794 --> 00:22:54,625
And three other girls made eyes
at me over at the buffet.

316
00:22:54,795 --> 00:22:57,887
I'm not saying it's something
I wanna pursue...

317
00:22:58,063 --> 00:23:00,495
...but it's nice to have options.

318
00:23:02,997 --> 00:23:05,623
There's more alcohol, right?

319
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,757
How you doing?

320
00:23:12,101 --> 00:23:13,692
Okay.

321
00:23:14,668 --> 00:23:17,635
You did a good thing today.

322
00:23:21,803 --> 00:23:25,703
- You wanna dance?
- No, that's fine.

323
00:23:25,939 --> 00:23:27,529
Come on.

324
00:23:27,705 --> 00:23:29,865
I'll let you lead.

325
00:23:48,212 --> 00:23:52,543
Look, penis, schmenis!
Okay? We're all people.

326
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:05,413
Which one of us will be
the first one to get married?

327
00:24:05,784 --> 00:24:07,444
Mon, I was married.

328
00:24:07,685 --> 00:24:10,618
- Yeah, me too, technically.
- I had a wedding.

329
00:24:10,786 --> 00:24:13,878
Just trying to start
an interesting discussion.

330
00:24:14,054 --> 00:24:18,647
Which one of us do you think
will be the last to get married?

331
00:24:22,223 --> 00:24:24,588
- Isn't Ben in this?
- Of course!

332
00:24:24,823 --> 00:24:26,847
Absolutely.

333
00:24:26,847 --> 00:24:27,846
