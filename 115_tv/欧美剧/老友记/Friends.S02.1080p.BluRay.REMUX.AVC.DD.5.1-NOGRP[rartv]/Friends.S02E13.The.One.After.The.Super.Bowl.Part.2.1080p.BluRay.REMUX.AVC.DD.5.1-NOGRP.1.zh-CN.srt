…西碧雪佛（著名电视明星）

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,900

So you guys in the movie or you just really paranoid?

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,260

00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,770
杰利是导演吗？他是哪一个？
Jerry is the director? Which one's he?

8
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,740
就是坐在导演椅子那个 我懂了
-The one in the director's chair? -Gotcha.

9
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,620
菲比，我们走
Pheebs,walk with me.

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,550
我干嘛要跟你走？
Why am I walking with you?

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,210
我们只是要走过来这里 远离那些…
We're just going over here so that we can get away from...

12
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,950
…嗜血肉的可怕病毒
...the horrible flesh-eating virus!

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,560
看在老天的份上，听我说
For the love of God,woman,listen to me!

14
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,030
他有没有在看？有没有在看？
Is he looking? Is he looking?

15
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,950
（茱莉亚罗伯茨）我有个难题 告诉我啊
-We've got a problem. -Tell me.

16
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,550
我没有办法帮克丽化妆
I can't do Chris' makeup.

17
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,120
她拒绝承认她的嘴巴上有胡子
She refuses to acknowledge her mustache.

18
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,520
很多吗？ 像眉毛掉到嘴上似的
-ls it bad? -lt looks like her eyebrow fell down.

19
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,290
除非有人说服她 让我帮她漂白…
Unless we convince her to let me bleach it...

我去跟她谈谈
I'll talk to her.

22
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,140
我讨厌演员
I hate actors.

23
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,970
老兄，伪装得不错 我刚才差点没看到你
Nice camouflage. For a minute there,I almost didn't see you.

24
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,050
抱歉
Excuse me.

25
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,750

我是苏西莫斯
I'm Susie Moss.

30
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,330
四年级呀，戴眼镜
Fourth grade? Glasses?

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,090
我常常像拿手提包一样 拿一包动物饼干
I carried a box of animal crackers like a purse?

32
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,340
苏西莫斯
Susie Moss!

33
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,540

记得班上的话剧吗？
Remember the class play?

39
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:59,420
你掀我的裙子 全礼堂的人都看到我的内裤了
You pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants?

40
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:05,260
对，那个时候 我用我的幽默感来保护自己
Yes. Back then,I used humor as a defense mechanism.

41
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,870
谢天谢地，我现在不用那样了
Thank God I don't do that anymore.

42
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:14,000
那么，儿童时代以来你一直在干什么呢？
So? What have you been doing since childhood?

43
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,260

00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,420
你看过“时空特警”吗？
Did you see Time Cop?

51
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,090
没有啊，他演得很好吗？

52
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,980
瑞秋，他完全改变了时空

你过去告诉他，他很可爱 最糟能怎样呢？
Go tell him he's cute. What's the worst that could happen?

55

他会听到的
He could hear me.

56
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,060

65
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:20,950
我不知道
I don't know.

你觉得你可爱吗？
Do you think you're cute?

67
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,270

…我朋友她觉得你很可爱

70
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,310
告诉她 我觉得她的朋友，很可爱

75
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,950
化妆  叫我了，我得走了

How many times must I touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date?

77

居然没人听到这句话？
No one was around to hear that?

83
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,650
他怎么说？
So what'd he say?

84
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,590
他真浑蛋
What a jerk!

85

…约我…

I'll get it.

101
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,780

If I ask you to,you'll end up drinking it yourself.

102
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,860
好不公平啊 我知道
-That is so unfair. -I know.

116
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,260
那吃我吧，我熟了
Okay,then eat me,I'm done!

我遇见完美的女人了

我们坐在沙发上 我们在亲热…
We're sitting on her couch,fooling around...

119
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:43,500
…突然她转过来对我说：

“你有想过在电梯里做吗？”
"Did you ever want to do it in an elevator?"

那你说什么？
What did you say?

122
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,820
我相信我的回答是…
I believe my exact words were....

123
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,690
你怎么知道 要不要在电梯里做？
How do you know if you wanna do that?

124
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,980
你就是知道
You just know.

125
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,670
我们得走了 三十分钟后订了餐厅位置
We gotta go. Got a reservation in 30 minutes.

00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,450
…我有个主意
... here's an idea.

130
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,450
你有没有穿过女人的内衣呀？
Have you ever worn women's underwear?

131
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:33,190
这个事实上，有…

132
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,120
…是我艾达姑妈的

133
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,030
一条裤子里挤了三个人
And there were three of us in there.

134
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:43,400
我在想，如果你今天…
I was thinking it would be kind of sexy...

135
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,770
…晚饭的时候穿我的内衣 会蛮性感的
...if you wore mine tonight at dinner.

136
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,610
你要我穿你内裤？
You want me to wear your panties?

137
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,150
可以吗？
Could you?

138
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,280
若我穿了你内裤的话，那么…
If I was wearing your underwear...

139
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,420
…你要穿什么？
...then what would you be wearing?

140
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,820
你太棒了
You're swell!

141
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,820
音乐准备好了，饭菜也好了
Got the music. Got the dinner.

142
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,000
我做了马修最喜欢吃的菜 香蕉蛋糕…
I made Marcel's favorite dish,banana cake...

143
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,230
…加了虫虫
...with mealworm.

144
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,600
蜡烛啊
Candle.

145
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,610
你以为今天晚上 这儿会发生什么事啊？
What do you think's gonna happen here tonight?

146
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,020
你正要过来…
Hi,are you on your way over

147
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,930
不会…我理解 我是说，猴子得工作嘛
No,I understand. A monkey's gotta work.

148
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,530
不，没什么大不了的
It's no big deal.

149
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:55,830
又不是说… 我计划了什么特别的
It's not like I had anything special planned.

150
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:35,130
是的，没问题
Yeah. Okay.

151
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,170
好的，再见
Okay. Bye.

152
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,250
真遗憾
I'm sorry, man.

153
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,630
-觉得怎么样 -什么？
-Feel that? -What?

154
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:21,190
我们是不是应该松开手了
The moment we should have stopped holding hands?.

155
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,770
瑞秋 那我们就由你先开始说好了
Rachel,why don't you start talking first?

156
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,630
好吧，我觉得 她这样是完全没道理的
I feel that this is totally unjustified.

157
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,970
她说我可以的 我又没做什么…
She gave me the green light,I did nothing

158
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,980
你以为 我在电视上看不到你吗？
Do you think I can't see you in the TV set?

159
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,490
好了，莫妮卡 你有什么话要说就说好了…
If there's something you'd like to share

160
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,320
你没有这个权利跟他出去
You had no right to date him!

161
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:51,580
你这么说太荒唐了吧 你出卖我
-That's the most ridiculous -You sold me out!

162
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,660
我才没有出卖你呢 有，你有
-I did not! -You absolutely

163
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,830
你让我讲好不好？
Would you let me talk!

164
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,460
你刚刚弹我的头？
Did you just flick me?

165
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:05,010
你不让我说完，我只是想…
Well,you wouldn't let me finish and I was

166
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,340
好痛啊
That hurt!

167
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,010
别弹了
Quit flicking!

168
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,270
你，你别弹了
Stop flicking!

169
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,140
是你先弹的，是你先弹的
You flicked me first!

170
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,060
别这样，别这样嘛
Let's not do this!

171
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,530
想点快乐的事！
Happy thoughts!

172
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,200
好吧，我要教训人了
Now I'm gonna kick some ass!

173
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:50,020
好吧 你们住手的话我就放手
All right. Now,I will let go if you both stop.

174
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,220
你要我不再见他吗？
You want me to stop seeing him?

175
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:57,820
你要我打电话给他 告诉他你要替我跟他约会吗？
You want me to just tell him you're seeing him instead?

176
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,090
你想这样吗？
Is that what you want?

177
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,270
你就是想这样？ 是的
That's what you want?

178
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,070
很好 很好
-Fine! -Fine!

179
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,700
好了
There we go.

180
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:15,570
我们要是在监狱里的话 你们就会是我的贱女人
If we were in prison,you guys would be,like,my bitches.

181
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,320
谢谢你们让我跟你们一起
Thanks for letting me tag along.

182
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,850
没什么
Forget about it.

183
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,920
你觉得怎么样，扭动先生？
How you doing there,squirmy?

184
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,950
我窝在里面
I'm hanging in.

185
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,660
有一点出来
And a little out.

186
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,200
你是导演的助理？
So assistant to the director?

187
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:44,340
你的工作一定很有意思 你一定有很多很酷的责任…
That's an exciting job. You must have a ton of responsibilities

188
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,010
我跟选角完全无关
I don't do the casting.

189
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:48,140
你们大家想吃什么？
So what are you guys gonna eat?

190
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:54,180
为什么我满脑子 都想着把那冰块放进嘴里…
How come all I can think about is putting that ice in my mouth...

191
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:57,290
…然后舔遍你的全身？
...and licking you all over?

192
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:03,320
因为我上的高中是男校 现在神要补偿我？
Because I went to an all-boys high school,and God is making up for it?

193
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,670
我现在就要你…
I want you right here...

194
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,490
…在这里
... right now.

195
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,360
现在？在这里？
Right now,right here?

196
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,400
你不认为这里是公共场所吗？
Don't you think we're in kind of a public place?

197
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,030
这里有活虾
They do have the shrimp.

198
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,710
到洗手间等我
Meet me in the bathroom.

199
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,090
现在我要去洗手间了
I'm going to the bathroom now.

200
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:49,090
他喜欢把我们留在圈里面
He likes to keep us in the loop.

201
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,000
来呀
Come on.

202
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
不敢相信我们在做这事
I can't believe we're doing this.

203
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,600
好，先生
All right,mister.

204
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:07,060
给我看那条内裤
Let's see those panties.

205
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:09,770
遵命
Alrighty.

206
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:16,680
你知道怎么样会更性感吗？
But you know what would be even sexier?

207
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,910
怎么样？
What?

208
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,450
你没把你的衬衫塞进去的话
If you didn't have your shirt tucked into them.

209
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:28,750
好，现在呢 我想看你只穿那件内裤
All right. Now,I would like to see you wearing nothing but them.

210
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,260
把衣服脱下来
Take your clothes off.

211
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:36,030
好吧，但是你要知道这表示 我们会错过特餐的介绍
I hope you realize this means we'll miss hearing about the specials.

212
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:38,800
来，快点…
Come on,hurry!

213
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,940
你要我快点弄好 还是要我做得好？
Do you want this done quick or done right?

214
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,900
好，转过去，我要看你的后面
All right,turn around. I wanna see you from behind.

215
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:50,980
有人跟着 “钢铁玻璃”录影带做运动哦
Somebody's been doing his Buns of Steel video.

216
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,810
所以你要我缩紧什么吗？ 或者是…
So you want me to clench anything or...?

217
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:58,720
苏西…
Susie?

218
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,060
这个就是报四年级的仇
This is for the fourth grade.

219
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,870
什么意思啊？ 什么“什么意思”？
-What do you mean? -What do I mean?

220
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,130
什么意思？！
What do I mean?!

221
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,970
我的意思是内裤，先生 那就是我的意思
I mean underpants,mister! That's what I mean!

222
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,570
什么意思？
What? What do you mean?

223
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,970
我的裙子…
My skirt...

224
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,010
…你掀开了，大家笑了
...you lifted. IKids laughing!

225
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,750
到十八岁大家还叫我内裤苏西
I was Susie Underpants till I was 18!

226
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:29,080
那是四年级的事了 你怎会到现在都还在生气呢？
That was in fourth grade! How could you still be upset?

227
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,690
你二十年后打电话给我 告诉我你是不是还在生气
Call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about this.

228
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:43,270
我也要告诉你 你这条内裤我是不会还你的
I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back!

229
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,940
我真不敢相信
I can't believe this.

230
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:58,480
两个礼拜前 我还在看“绝命杀阵”…
Just two weeks ago,I was watching Sudden Death...

231
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:02,020
…现在我竟然在跟尚格云顿约会
...and now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme.

232
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,120
你能打扁那个家伙吗？
Can you beat up that guy?

233
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:08,350
扁这个呢？当然
-Can you beat up that guy? -Sure.

234
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,650
这太疯狂了
This is so wild.

235
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:16,130
我得承认我有点奇怪 你会同意跟我来个盲目约会
I gotta admit,I was surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.

236
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,300
通常我是不会答应的
Normally,I would not do it.

237
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:22,740
是吗？ 那你为什么会为我破例呢？
What made you make the exception for me?

238
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,070
因为瑞秋告诉我说…
Rachel told me...

239
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:28,040
…你想跟我还有茱儿芭莉摩 来个“三人行”啊
...you were dying to have a threesome with me and Drew Barrymore.

240
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,410
对了，茱儿她有一些规矩的…
By the way,Drew has some ground rules and....

241
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,180
-说你对不起我 -不
-Say you're sorry -No

242
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,410
说！
Say it!

243
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,520
不，我才不要跟你说抱歉呢
No! I'm not gonna!

244
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,680
快说…好极了
Say it! Say it! Great!

245
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:49,870
瑞秋，道歉 不然你的毛衣就遭殃
Say you're sorry or your sweater gets it.

246
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,600
那是我最喜欢的毛衣 我第三次约会的毛衣
That is my favorite sweater! That is my third-date sweater!

247
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,670
说，你很抱歉
Say you're sorry.

248
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:02,450
你想玩，是不是？
You wanna play? Okay,let's play.

249
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,770
好，咱们就来玩
Let's play.

250
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:10,580
你想怎么样？
What'll you do?

251
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,620
把毛衣还给我 否则这就变成番茄酱皮包了
Give me back my sweater or it's handbag marinara.

252
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,190
你才不敢这么做
You don't have the guts.

253
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,730
是吗？至少我不会不敢 告诉男人，我觉得他很可爱
Yeah? At least I wasn't too chicken to tell some guy he was cute.

254
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,040
好了，住手，疯婆子
Stop! Stop the madness!

255
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,280
你们两个疯了
This is crazy!

256
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:44,480
现在你们谁还记得 你们本来在吵些什么东西吗？
Who can remember why you're fighting in the first place?

257
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,560
对，没错
Yes,that's right.

258
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,590
但是…
But still....

259
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,260
看看你的皮包
Look at your purse!

260
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,570
看看你的毛衣
Look at your sweater!

261
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,500
看看你们自己
Look at yourselves!

262
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,970
我会帮你补毛衣的
I'll help you fix your sweater.

263
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,640
我会帮你…
I'll help you...

264
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,680
…丢掉皮包
...throw out your purse.

265
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,620
对不起，我阻止你再见他
I'm sorry I made you stop seeing him.

266
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:22,620
对不起 我知道你喜欢他还跟他约会
I'm sorry I went out with him when I knew you liked him.

267
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:27,520
对不起，我…借了你的手套
I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves.

268
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,150
乔伊？
Joey?

269
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,340
妈？
Ma?

270
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:58,220
钱德？你在这儿干嘛？ 我以为你们走了
Chandler？What are you doing here? I thought you guys took off.

271
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,390
不不不，是她走了，带着我的衣服
She took off with my clothes!
