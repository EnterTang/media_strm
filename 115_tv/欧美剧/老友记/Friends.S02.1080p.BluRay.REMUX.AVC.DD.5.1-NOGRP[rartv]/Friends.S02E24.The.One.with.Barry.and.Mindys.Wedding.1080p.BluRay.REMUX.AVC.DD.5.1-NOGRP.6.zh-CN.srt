1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,660
- Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?
- Incredible!

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,500
I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,870
- Who?
- All right. I'll give you one hint.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:12,870
Warren Beatty.

5
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,400
Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem.

6
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,180
See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,250
'Cause he was just so darn cute.

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,890
No, as part of the audition.
See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,920
Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it.

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,430
Or you just do it.

11
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,730
I did do it, I'm a professional.

12
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:42,800
Then what's the problem?

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,870
See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says

14
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,040
'good actor, bad kisser'.

15
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,870
Can you believe that, me not a good kisser,

16
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:56,150
that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother.

17
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:01,890
Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing Ooh.

18
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,740
Hey, what did your agent say?

19
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:02,880
Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday.

20
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,850
Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong.

21
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,120
Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me.

22
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,020
- What, forget it!
- Yeah, right.

23
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,790
Come on, I need your help here.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,620
All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again.

25
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,890
You see this, this is a friend.

26
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,230
Uh-huh, let's go.

27
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,660
Oh, wait I have gum.

28
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:25,900
Okay.

29
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,880
Good, very good, firm but tender.

30
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,910
I'd recommend you to a friend.

31
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,190
Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?

32
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,790
Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men,

33
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,790
maybe you just tensed up a little, 

34
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,490
maybe that's what you need to work on.

35
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,730
Yeah, that makes sense.

36
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,970
Over my dead body!

37
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,940
And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.

38
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,180
Come on out, honey! I'm telling you look good!

39
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,110
Tell her she looks good, tell her she looks good.

40
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,230
Oh my God,

41
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,660
you look so good!

42
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:33,460
I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people

43
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,680
looking like something you drink when your nauseous.

44
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:43,010
So don't,
I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding.

45
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,340
Because I promised Mindy I would.

46
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,850
Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him.

47
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,120
Look you guys, I have to go, I'm the Maid-of-Honor.

48
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,590
And besides you know what I just need

49
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,100
to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself.

50
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,880
Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action?

51
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,170
- I may have.
- Woo-hoo, stuud!

52
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,080
- What's she look like?
- Well, we haven't exactly met,

53
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,480
we just stayed up all night talking on the internet.

54
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,450
Woo-hoo, geeek!

55
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,320
I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl,

56
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,290
you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy...

57
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,430
- Get out!
- Nooo!

58
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,800
Well she totally called me on it, okay. She said, 'cut it out, get real',

59
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:39,600
and I did.

60
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,070
Wow! What's that like?

61
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,110
It's like this,

62
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,710
me, no jokes.

63
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,080
All right, stop it, you're freaking me out.

64
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,820
Oh, yeah, I don't like you this way.

65
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,160
- All right, I'll see you guys later.
- Bye, Richard.

66
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,350
Bye sweetie,

67
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,860
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

68
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,500
I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy,

69
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,110
I wonder what our wedding's gonna be like.

70
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,640
What are you talking about? What wedding?

71
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,440
Come on, like you never talk about that.

72
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,920
Nooo! Never! 

73
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,020
I mean, we're living in the moment. 

74
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,420
God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'

75
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,990
- Afraid to ask him?
- Could not be more terrified.

76
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,790
Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing,

77
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:42,000
give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.

78
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,570
Where's Benny?

79
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,210
There he is!

80
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,240
Where's Benny,

81
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,010
there he is.

82
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,950
Awww! You know that's probably why babies learn to talk,

83
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,880
so they can tell grown ups to cut it out.

84
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:07,930
Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure.

85
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:08,820
Okay.

86
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,260
Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?

87
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:15,730
Sure I do.

88
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,000
Yeah, am I in it?

89
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,430
Honey, you are it.

90
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:26,270
Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky.

91
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,110
Keep talkin'.

92
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:36,320
Well, uh, sometimes I think about selling my practice, 

93
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,320
we could move to France,

94
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,950
make French toast.

95
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:48,470
Okay, so, uh, we're in France,

96
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,500
 we're making the toast.

97
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,100
Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?

98
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,010
Like a hound?

99
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,820
Not a basset, a bassinet.

100
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,650
You really need the bassinet?

101
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,620
Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog.

102
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,790
Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future.

103
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,200
Oh, hey, I love children,

104
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,190
I have children.

105
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,600
I just don't want to be 70

106
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:28,040
when our kids go off to college, and our lives can finally start.

107
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:36,080
Look I want you, now.

108
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,780
That's Great.

109
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,680
You know we don't need to talk about this now.

110
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,690
Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future,

111
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:49,590
I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet.

112
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,800
Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much.

113
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,430
Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone.

114
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,600
Joey, no means no!

115
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,540
I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep.

116
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,080
Aww, Rach, I think you look cute

117
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,450
And you, uh, you,

118
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,420
- you I could eat with a spoon
- Get away from me I said no!

119
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,260
- Richard buzzed. He's waiting downstairs.
- Oh, Richard's here.

120
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,340
 I should run down say bye to him

121
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:37,940
 Bye.

122
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,820
So how's your date with your cyberchick going.

123
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,410
 Ooh, hey, what is all that?

124
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,110
Oh, it's a website, it's the, uh, the Guggenheim museum.

125
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,550
See, she likes art,

126
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,060
and I like funny words.

127
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,660
What does she mean by HH?

128
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,190
It means we're holding hands.

129
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,540
Are you the cutest?

130
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,330
I'm afraid I might just be.

131
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,210
You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person

132
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,840
and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads,

133
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,650
or. It could be a guy.

134
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,320
Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her.

135
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,390
It could be like a big giant guy.

136
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,730
Man, I got this close to him and Monica kneed me in the back.

137
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,130
What's going on?

138
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,870
We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.

139
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,370
Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live.

140
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,030
Women live longer than men.

141
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,450
How do you not fall down more?

142
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:52,350
Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'

143
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:53,710
All right.

144
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,450
"My husband is sleeping with his secretary."

145
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:02,790
She's married!

146
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,690
Well at least we know she's a woman.

147
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,290
I can't believe she's married.

148
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,340
Aw, man I'm sorry.

149
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,380
This must be very tough for ya, huh.

150
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:26,150
So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings,

151
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,610
because when pigeons eat rice it kills them.

152
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,380
Oh, that's why you never see pigeons at sushi bars.

153
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,360
- See, we're having fun.
- Oh, absolutely.

154
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,800
Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not going to be thinking about.

155
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,660
Neither am I.

156
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,070
Hi, there. Are you all right?

157
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:49,870
Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding,

158
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,450
and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't,

159
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,980
people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time.

160
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,710
Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right. It's a wedding,

161
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,860
generally people focus on the bride.

162
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,690
God I know, you're right.

163
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,450
All rightie, everybody look at me. Good.

164
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,720
All right, its time. Bridesmaids and ushers let's see two lines, thank you.

165
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,560
Okay, I'll see you after the thing.

166
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,260
- Okay, good luck
- Thank you

167
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,770
Okay, Okay.

168
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,310
Why the hell didn't you tell me!

169
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,820
I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do

170
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,420
stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!'

171
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,350
Oh my God this is sooo humiliating.

172
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,020
I think the only thing that tops that was, was,

173
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:44,530
was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school.

174
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,260
I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out.

175
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,200
Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes.

176
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,340
Rach, hey look, I remember that, it wasn't so bad.

177
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,740
Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you.

178
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,840
Rachel!

179
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,800
Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg.

180
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,310
It's so wonderful to see you again, my dear,

181
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:06,250
in fact I hardly expected to see so much.

182
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,590
You told me you didn't see anything.

183
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,090
I tell ya a lot things!

184
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:17,020
Well it's wonderful to have you up and about, again, dear.

185
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,360
Stay well.

186
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:24,070
Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today.

187
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,270
Rach! Rach!

188
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,540
- Oh my God, I'm married!
- I know.

189
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,110
I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter hyphen Farber.

190
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,310
Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min.

191
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,050
Min.

192
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,040
Oh Rach, you're still here,

193
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,680
at our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now.

194
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,750
Yeah, I love that story.

195
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:47,960
Um, I got a question for you guys.

196
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,560
Why do people keep is saying that is good to see me up and about?

197
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,630
Well uh, after you ran out on your wedding,

198
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,900
Barry's parents told people that you were sort of....insane.

199
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,140
Insane!

200
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,240
...from the syphilis.

201
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,170
What?!

202
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,750
Yeah, what are they gonna say you didn't love me anymore. Come on.

203
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,780
Angela? Joey Tribiani.

204
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,180
Listen, what are ya doing tonight?

205
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,430
I know your seeing that guy, I was thinking maybe you could bring him.....

206
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,090
Hello? Hello?

207
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,730
Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent.

208
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,110
- She wants to know what's wrong?
- What's wrong? What's wrong?

209
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,750
You're married that's what's wrong.

210
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,490
- Oh, my.
- What?

211
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,420
She wants to meet you in person.

212
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,490
Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too,

213
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:56,030
okay, but she's married, she has a husband.

214
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,820
What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy.

215
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,360
I mean you don't get chances like this all the time,

216
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,900
if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself

217
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,630
when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip.

218
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,310
Okay, I'll do it!

219
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,110
Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! 

220
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,220
Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and meet her!

221
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,820
Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a shower, 'cause, eww.

222
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,750
No, you know what you have to answer her, answer her first.

223
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,480
No, no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much.

224
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:36,030
Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will.

225
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,800
Okay, last chance.

226
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,510
Again, I'm sorry.

227
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,250
You know what, maybe I don't need to have children.

228
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,960
You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society, 

229
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,650
and by that I mean my mom,

230
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,980
has always convinced me that I...

231
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,130
I do, 

232
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,100
I have to have children, I'm sorry. I just do.

233
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:16,510
Yo! Can I have your attention, please,

234
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,770
Best Man, making a toast here. 

235
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,140
Thank you.

236
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,970
I remember when Barry got home from his first date with Rachel...

237
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:28,990
What?!

238
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,960
What, you hired the same band I can't use the same speech.

239
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,060
Thank you, thank you very much.

240
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:39,560
Anyway, I wish you both a wonderful life together.

241
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:41,760
And Rachel...

242
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,070
- What.
- No, no, no now in all seriousness,

243
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:48,300
its not a lot of women would've had the guts to come back here tonight,

244
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,470
and even fewer, who would do it with their asses hanging out!

245
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,850
Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that...

246
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,280
- Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?

247
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:09,400
Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend.

248
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,390
Oh dear God.

249
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,660
Ross,

250
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:19,260
 uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight.

251
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,440
And, uh, for the record

252
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,440
she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis.

253
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,850
What are you doing I'm serious. 

254
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:38,990
Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him,

255
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:42,500
which incidentally worked out pretty well for me

256
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:50,990
Cheers!

257
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,700
- See you in the parking lot.
- No, Rach!

258
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,910
And once again she is out of here.

259
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,020
Okay who had 9:45? Um?

260
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:19,590
Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave.

261
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,700
I probably should, but I'm not,

262
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:27,500
see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings.

263
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,910
See now, tonight, all I really wanted was 

264
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,420
to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity.

265
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,910
Well, I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen.

266
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:52,830
There's nothing really left to say except....

267
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:04,910
"Her name was Lola. She was a showgirl. 

268
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:14,210
With yellow feathers, feathers in her hair, and a dress cut down to there.

269
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,310
She would..."

270
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,580
- Marenge,
- "...marenge, thank you honey,

271
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,530
and do the cha-cha.

272
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,730
And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar. 

273
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,990
At the, wait, wait, everybody.."

274
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,620
Okay, I'll do it.

275
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:56,790
You'll do what?

276
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,860
If kids is what I takes to be with you then kids it is.

277
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,100
Oh my God!

278
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,060
If I have to I'll, I'll do all again,

279
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,370
I'll do the 4 o'clock feeding thing, 

280
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,470
I'll go to the P.T.A. meetings,

281
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,410
I'll coach the soccer team.

282
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,580
- Really?
- Yeah, if I have to.

283
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,180
Monica, 

284
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,610
I don't wanna lose you, 

285
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:27,020
so if I have to do it all over again, then I will.

286
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,130
You're the most wonderful man.

287
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:41,510
And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times,

288
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,200
then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'

289
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,110
But you're not.

290
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,180
Oh my God,

291
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,180
I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say.

292
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,720
I wanna have a baby,

293
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,990
but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one.

294
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,100
God.

295
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,180
I love you.

296
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,680
I know you do.

297
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:30,920
Me too. 

298
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:39,660
So what now?

299
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,460
I guess we just

300
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,260
keep dancing.

301
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,110
Where is she, Where is she?

302
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,220
Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she?

303
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:09,320
Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here.

304
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:13,890
Ooh, oh, oh, that's her.

305
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,700
Yeah, 'cause life's just that kind.

306
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:21,610
Chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door. It's like a watched pot,

307
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:25,070
you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil.

308
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:29,250
I think what you have to do is try not to...

309
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,520
Oh my God!  

310
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:44,030
OH.....MY.....GAWD!! 

311
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:57,680
OH.....MY.....GOD!!

312
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:09,710
All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this,

313
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:14,420
