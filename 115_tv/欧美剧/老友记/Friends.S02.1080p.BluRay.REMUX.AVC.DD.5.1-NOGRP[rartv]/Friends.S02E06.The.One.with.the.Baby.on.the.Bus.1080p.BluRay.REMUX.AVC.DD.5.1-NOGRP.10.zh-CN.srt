1
00:00:03,448 --> 00:00:05,277
Who the winny-binny boy?

2
00:00:06,148 --> 00:00:10,274
You the winny-winny-binny-binny boy!
Yes.

3
00:00:11,948 --> 00:00:13,971
Now, don't cry.

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,272
Don't cry.

5
00:00:17,982 --> 00:00:20,311
Why is he still crying?

6
00:00:20,848 --> 00:00:25,746
Don't worry. It's nothing that can't
be solved by ''happy keys.''

7
00:00:26,181 --> 00:00:30,273
I feel better when someone
shakes jagged metal in my face.

8
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:32,276
All right, here.

9
00:00:32,882 --> 00:00:34,939
Let me hold him for a sec.

10
00:00:35,148 --> 00:00:36,546
Here we go.

11
00:00:37,815 --> 00:00:39,508
There we are.

12
00:00:40,181 --> 00:00:41,738
Maybe it's me.

13
00:00:42,015 --> 00:00:45,879
Don't be silly. Ben loves you.
He's being Mr. Cranky Pants.

14
00:00:46,181 --> 00:00:49,409
You know, I once dated
a Miss Cranky Pants.

15
00:00:50,015 --> 00:00:52,537
Lovely girl. Kind of moody.

16
00:00:53,381 --> 00:00:55,176
There we go. All better.

17
00:00:55,782 --> 00:00:57,771
There's my little boy.

18
00:01:04,214 --> 00:01:06,510
Can I see something?

19
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:23,907
-Cool!
-He hates me. My nephew hates me!

20
00:01:24,581 --> 00:01:27,911
-I知 unemployed and he hates me.
-Don't do this.

21
00:01:28,115 --> 00:01:30,444
You're just unemployed.

22
00:01:31,481 --> 00:01:34,276
What if my own baby hates me?
What do I do?

23
00:01:34,481 --> 00:01:36,072
Monica, this is nuts!

24
00:01:36,281 --> 00:01:40,338
You know how long it'll be
before you have to deal with this?

25
00:01:41,082 --> 00:01:44,014
You don't even have a boyfriend yet.

26
00:01:46,048 --> 00:01:48,513
Joey, she does not look fat.

27
00:01:49,414 --> 00:01:51,573
The One With the Baby on the Bus

28
00:02:35,115 --> 00:02:37,546
-Here you go.
-Hey, Mon.

29
00:02:41,748 --> 00:02:43,611
Goo, goo, goo!

30
00:02:46,115 --> 00:02:49,013
That is so funny!
Let me see that a sec.

31
00:02:56,915 --> 00:02:59,245
-You okay, Ross?
-I don't know.

32
00:03:01,249 --> 00:03:02,805
What's in this pie?

33
00:03:03,015 --> 00:03:06,674
I don't know. Butter and eggs,
flour and lime and kiwi--

34
00:03:06,882 --> 00:03:09,075
Kiwi? Kiwi?!

35
00:03:09,482 --> 00:03:11,175
You said it was key lime.

36
00:03:11,382 --> 00:03:15,246
No, I said kiwi lime.
That's what makes it special.

37
00:03:15,615 --> 00:03:18,013
That's what's gonna kill me.

38
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,846
I知 allergic to kiwi.

39
00:03:21,282 --> 00:03:25,078
No, you're not. You're allergic
to lobster, peanuts and--

40
00:03:27,149 --> 00:03:28,547
Oh, my God!

41
00:03:28,748 --> 00:03:33,010
-It's definitely getting worse.
-Is your tongue swelling up?

42
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:36,313
Either that or my mouth
is getting smaller!

43
00:03:36,882 --> 00:03:39,075
We're going to the hospital.

44
00:03:39,282 --> 00:03:41,544
-Is he okay?
-He's gotta get a shot.

45
00:03:41,748 --> 00:03:45,112
You know, actually
it's getting better. It is.

46
00:03:45,315 --> 00:03:47,712
Let's not go.
Anyone for Scrabble?

47
00:03:48,882 --> 00:03:50,643
Jacket, now!

48
00:03:51,082 --> 00:03:54,912
What about Ben? We can't
bring a baby to the hospital.

49
00:03:55,115 --> 00:03:56,740
We'll watch him.

50
00:03:57,115 --> 00:03:58,638
I don't think so.

51
00:03:59,915 --> 00:04:04,211
I have seven Catholic sisters.
I take care of hundreds of kids.

52
00:04:04,715 --> 00:04:08,977
-We wanna do it. Don't we?
-I was gonna play basketball but...

53
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:11,477
...I guess that's out the window.

54
00:04:12,315 --> 00:04:15,406
If you take him for a walk,
remember his hat.

55
00:04:15,616 --> 00:04:18,411
There's milk in the fridge
and extra diapers.

56
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:20,080
Hat, milk....

57
00:04:20,282 --> 00:04:23,077
-Got it!
-Let's go.

58
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:32,046
Consider it done!

59
00:04:32,549 --> 00:04:37,038
-You understood that?
-My uncle Sal has a really big tongue.

60
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:41,040
Is he the one
with the beautiful wife?

61
00:04:46,783 --> 00:04:50,215
Want to hear the song
I知 singing this afternoon?

62
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,779
-I wrote it this morning in the shower.
-Okay.

63
00:04:55,282 --> 00:04:59,738
I'm in the shower
And I'm writing a song

64
00:05:00,315 --> 00:05:04,042
Stop me if you've heard it

65
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:10,213
My skin is soapy and my hair is wet

66
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:14,643
And Tegrin spelled backward is Nirget

67
00:05:18,415 --> 00:05:22,541
Rachel, sweetheart,
could I see you for a minute?

68
00:05:26,315 --> 00:05:27,713
What's up?

69
00:05:28,115 --> 00:05:29,809
FYI:

70
00:05:30,015 --> 00:05:34,277
I致e decided to pay a professional
musician to play on Sundays.

71
00:05:34,482 --> 00:05:38,608
Her name's Stephanie something.
She's supposed to be very good.

72
00:05:38,816 --> 00:05:42,043
-But what about Phoebe?
-Rachel...

73
00:05:42,249 --> 00:05:44,613
...it's not that your friend is bad.

74
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:47,540
It's that she's so bad...

75
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:53,810
...she makes me want to put my finger
through my eye into my brain...

76
00:05:54,048 --> 00:05:55,708
...and swirl it around.

77
00:05:57,783 --> 00:06:00,214
Okay, so you're not a fan.

78
00:06:01,048 --> 00:06:04,708
But, I mean, come on.
You cannot do this to her.

79
00:06:06,016 --> 00:06:07,777
Oh, no.

80
00:06:07,983 --> 00:06:09,471
I have to do this?

81
00:06:09,682 --> 00:06:11,841
Lather, rinse, repeat

82
00:06:12,049 --> 00:06:14,241
And lather, rinse, repeat

83
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:17,938
And lather, rinse, repeat

84
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:19,877
As needed

85
00:06:26,582 --> 00:06:28,207
We didn't bring enough.

86
00:06:28,415 --> 00:06:31,575
Did you forget to pack
the baby's anvil?

87
00:06:31,783 --> 00:06:33,079
It'll be worth it.

88
00:06:33,649 --> 00:06:36,115
It's a fact that women love babies.

89
00:06:36,315 --> 00:06:40,771
Women love guys who love babies.
It's the sensitive thing.

90
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:45,075
Aim him at that pack of babes.
Maybe one will break away.

91
00:06:45,482 --> 00:06:48,812
Wait, forget them.
We got one. Hard left.

92
00:06:49,016 --> 00:06:50,879
-Give me the baby.
-I got him.

93
00:06:51,116 --> 00:06:54,707
-Come on, seriously.
-Oh, seriously you want him?

94
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:56,380
Hello.

95
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,048
Hello.

96
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,639
Who is this cutie-pie?

97
00:07:01,116 --> 00:07:03,775
Well, don't think me immodest, but...

98
00:07:03,983 --> 00:07:05,448
...me.

99
00:07:06,883 --> 00:07:10,145
-Want to smell him?
-We're talking about the baby?

100
00:07:12,816 --> 00:07:17,146
He's got that great baby smell.
Get a whiff of his head.

101
00:07:18,382 --> 00:07:20,871
My uterus just skipped a beat.

102
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,681
What'd I tell you?

103
00:07:22,883 --> 00:07:26,747
-It's great you're doing this.
-Well, we are great guys.

104
00:07:26,983 --> 00:07:30,074
My brother and his boyfriend
are trying to adopt.

105
00:07:30,315 --> 00:07:33,146
What agency did you two go through?

106
00:07:37,382 --> 00:07:38,973
But this is my gig.

107
00:07:39,183 --> 00:07:40,614
This is where I play.

108
00:07:40,816 --> 00:07:43,373
My name is written out there in chalk.

109
00:07:43,582 --> 00:07:46,810
You know, you can't just erase chalk.

110
00:07:49,516 --> 00:07:50,914
Honey, I知 sorry.

111
00:07:51,116 --> 00:07:53,411
And he's going to
be pay this woman?

112
00:07:53,616 --> 00:07:56,810
Why doesn't he give her a throne
and a crown?

113
00:07:57,016 --> 00:08:01,744
And, like, a gold stick
with a ball on top?

114
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:06,108
Terry is a jerk! That's why we say,
''Terry's a jerk!''

115
00:08:06,383 --> 00:08:09,042
That's where that came from.

116
00:08:10,183 --> 00:08:14,047
Yeah, okay. You probably did
everything you could.

117
00:08:15,283 --> 00:08:19,544
Okay, you know what? Let me just see
what else I can do.

118
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:25,045
All right. Let her go on after
Stephanie whatever-her-name-is.

119
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,647
You won't be here. Don't pay her.

120
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:31,579
-I don't know.
-I値l clean the cappuccino machine!

121
00:08:31,783 --> 00:08:35,045
You don't clean
the cappuccino machine?

122
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:38,578
Of course I clean it.

123
00:08:38,816 --> 00:08:41,543
I mean, I will clean it.

124
00:08:41,749 --> 00:08:46,478
-I mean, I will clean it.
-All right, fine!

125
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,847
-Done.
-Really?

126
00:08:53,049 --> 00:08:55,072
Who's working for you, babe?

127
00:08:55,283 --> 00:08:59,908
Oh, my God! This is so exciting!
How much am I gonna get?

128
00:09:00,116 --> 00:09:01,548
What?

129
00:09:01,883 --> 00:09:04,940
You said he's paying
the people who play.

130
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:10,148
I meant, he's paying that other woman
because she's a professional.

131
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:14,208
I知 not gonna be the only one
not getting paid.

132
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,507
-But Pheebs--
-No, I知 sorry, no!

133
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:21,314
No, I知 not some sloppy second,
you know, charity band.

134
00:09:21,517 --> 00:09:23,982
There are thousands of places...

135
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,977
...where people would pay
to hear me play.

136
00:09:27,183 --> 00:09:29,046
When I play, I play for me

137
00:09:29,283 --> 00:09:31,306
I don't need your charity

138
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,981
Thank you!

139
00:09:41,183 --> 00:09:44,479
I知 not getting a shot.
They can take the needle...

140
00:09:44,716 --> 00:09:47,807
...and squirt it in my mouth.
Like a squirt gun.

141
00:09:48,016 --> 00:09:49,879
See what the doctor says.

142
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:53,709
They've got to do something.
These are the '90s.

143
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,515
Hello, there. I知 Dr. Carlin.

144
00:09:56,883 --> 00:10:00,543
I see someone's having
a little allergic reaction.

145
00:10:00,849 --> 00:10:03,906
Doctor, can I see you
for just a moment?

146
00:10:05,383 --> 00:10:09,247
My brother has a slight phobia
about needles.

147
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,712
Did you tell him
about my squirt gun idea?

148
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,212
My brother would like to know...

149
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,678
...if there's a way
to treat this orally?

150
00:10:19,883 --> 00:10:24,975
Under these circumstances, it has to
be an injection and it has to be now.

151
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,548
So?

152
00:10:28,983 --> 00:10:32,881
Have a seat. The doctor says
it's gotta be a needle.

153
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:38,072
You're just gonna have to be brave.
Can you do that for me?

154
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,546
-Okay.
-Okay. Oh, boy!

155
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,443
You are doing so good.

156
00:10:45,517 --> 00:10:47,415
You want to squeeze my hand?

157
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,373
Ross, don't squeeze it so hard.

158
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,208
Honey, really.
Don't squeeze it so hard!

159
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,177
Ross, let go of my hand!

160
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,181
Good. Next time we pick up women...

161
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:04,211
...we should go to the park
and make out.

162
00:11:04,517 --> 00:11:06,005
Taxi! Taxi!

163
00:11:08,283 --> 00:11:11,443
Hey, look at that talent.

164
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,907
Just practicing. You're good.

165
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,810
Carry on.

166
00:11:17,016 --> 00:11:19,039
Wait, wait, wait!

167
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:22,541
Hey, you. He is just adorable.

168
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:27,011
Can you tell him that?
Because he thinks he looks too pink.

169
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:31,983
-What are you guys out doing today?
-We're not out.

170
00:11:33,483 --> 00:11:36,415
We're two hetero guys
hanging with the son...

171
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:41,605
...of our other heterosexual friend,
doing the usual straight-guy stuff.

172
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,239
-You done?
-Yeah.

173
00:11:44,717 --> 00:11:46,273
There's our stop.

174
00:11:46,483 --> 00:11:49,176
Get out of here! This is our stop.

175
00:11:49,383 --> 00:11:51,178
You guys live here too?

176
00:11:51,517 --> 00:11:54,381
We live in the building
by the sidewalk.

177
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,548
Do you know it?

178
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:04,180
Since we're neighbors, what do you say
we get together for a drink?

179
00:12:08,483 --> 00:12:10,642
So you wanna go to Marquel's?

180
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,073
Sure, they love us.

181
00:12:13,617 --> 00:12:16,015
Where's your baby?

182
00:12:20,817 --> 00:12:23,510
Ben! Ben!

183
00:12:23,884 --> 00:12:27,509
That's good. Maybe he'll
hear you and pull the cord!

184
00:12:27,683 --> 00:12:29,808
-Stop the bus! Hey!
-No!

185
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:33,074
-We need the baby!
-Wait!

186
00:12:37,917 --> 00:12:40,348
You sure it didn't break?
It hurts.

187
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:43,914
No, it's just a good bone bruise.

188
00:12:44,617 --> 00:12:49,141
And right here is the puncture wound
from your ring.

189
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:52,178
-I知 really sorry.
-It's okay.

190
00:12:52,383 --> 00:12:53,781
Sorry.

191
00:12:54,184 --> 00:12:57,980
Sorry! Hey! I got my ''S''s back!

192
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,976
Which we can celebrate later.

193
00:13:01,617 --> 00:13:04,310
Celebrate. Celebrate....

194
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,647
He was a double, double

195
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:10,248
Double-jointed boy

196
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:15,473
Hey, so are you the professional
guitar player?

197
00:13:16,084 --> 00:13:17,572
Yeah, I知 Stephanie.

198
00:13:18,217 --> 00:13:22,081
Right. My name was on there.
Now it just says carrot cake.

199
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:27,448
-Okay.
-So how many chords do you know?

200
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,481
-All of them.
-So you know D?

201
00:13:31,683 --> 00:13:35,013
-Yeah.
-Okay. Do you know A-minor?

202
00:13:36,184 --> 00:13:40,673
Okay, do you know
how to go from D to A-minor?

203
00:13:41,117 --> 00:13:43,582
-Yeah.
-Okay.

204
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:46,948
So does your guitar have a strap?

205
00:13:48,384 --> 00:13:50,815
-No.
-Mine does.

206
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,449
Stephanie knows all the chords

207
00:13:59,384 --> 00:14:01,849
Come on! Pick up, pick up! Hello.

208
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:06,976
Transit Authority? Yes. Hello.
I知 doing research for a book.

209
00:14:07,184 --> 00:14:12,378
I was wondering what somebody might do
if they left a baby on a city bus.

210
00:14:13,084 --> 00:14:15,811
Yes, I realize that would be stupid.

211
00:14:16,017 --> 00:14:18,642
We lost a car seat on a bus today.

212
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,283
It's white plastic
and it fits onto a stroller.

213
00:14:22,484 --> 00:14:24,745
And there was a baby in it.

214
00:14:25,683 --> 00:14:27,808
He wants to talk to you again.

215
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:32,283
Everybody, let's give a warm
Central Perk welcome to--

216
00:14:32,484 --> 00:14:35,314
Terry's a jerk
And he won't let me work

217
00:14:35,518 --> 00:14:37,450
And I hate Central Perk

218
00:14:42,117 --> 00:14:44,912
To Stephanie Schiffer!

219
00:14:49,618 --> 00:14:54,448
I壇 like to start with a song I wrote
for the first man I ever loved.

220
00:14:57,451 --> 00:14:58,848
Zachary--

221
00:14:59,084 --> 00:15:02,016
Are all invited to bite me

222
00:15:11,117 --> 00:15:14,776
We're the guys that called
about the baby! Is he here?

223
00:15:15,618 --> 00:15:17,208
He's here.

224
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,410
Is one of you the father?

225
00:15:21,651 --> 00:15:23,446
-That's me.
-I知 him.

226
00:15:25,718 --> 00:15:29,945
Actually, we're both the father.

227
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,873
-Oh, Ben!
-Hey, buddy.

228
00:15:47,718 --> 00:15:50,616
Tell me you know
which one is our baby.

229
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:54,840
One has ducks on his shirt
and one has clowns.

230
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:58,948
And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.
Or clowns.

231
00:16:00,818 --> 00:16:05,147
That one's Ben! Remember, he had
that little mole by his mouth!

232
00:16:05,618 --> 00:16:08,743
Hey, Ben! Remember us?

233
00:16:09,084 --> 00:16:11,016
Okay, the mole came off.

234
00:16:12,317 --> 00:16:14,442
What are we gonna do?

235
00:16:15,618 --> 00:16:17,516
Flip for it.
Ducks or clowns.

236
00:16:17,718 --> 00:16:19,809
We're gonna flip for the baby?

237
00:16:20,084 --> 00:16:22,516
All right, call it in the air.

238
00:16:23,484 --> 00:16:26,075
-Heads.
-Heads, it is.

239
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,982
We have to assign heads to something!

240
00:16:32,918 --> 00:16:35,713
Right! Okay.

241
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:41,005
Ducks is heads
because ducks have heads.

242
00:16:45,417 --> 00:16:48,975
What kind of scary-ass clowns
came to your birthday?

243
00:19:44,318 --> 00:19:46,909
-Hey.
-Oh, hi.

244
00:19:47,118 --> 00:19:49,811
Here. I thought you might be cold.

245
00:19:50,051 --> 00:19:51,449
Thank you.

246
00:19:58,785 --> 00:20:00,580
Look at you!
You did well.

247
00:20:01,051 --> 00:20:04,017
8 dollars and 27 cents.

248
00:20:04,185 --> 00:20:07,981
But not really
because I put in the first two.

249
00:20:08,185 --> 00:20:12,140
Just to get the ball rolling
and to make myself feel better.

250
00:20:12,718 --> 00:20:15,310
-Do you?
-No.

251
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:19,451
This whole playing for money thing
is so not good for me.

252
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,676
I don't know, when I sang
''Su-Su-Suicide''...

253
00:20:25,118 --> 00:20:28,573
...I got, like, $1 .75.

254
00:20:29,085 --> 00:20:30,914
But then ''Smelly Cat''?

255
00:20:32,785 --> 00:20:36,013
I got 25 cents and a condom.

256
00:20:37,252 --> 00:20:41,344
So, you know, now I just feel
really bad for ''Smelly Cat.''

257
00:20:43,485 --> 00:20:47,577
Honey, I don't think
everybody gets ''Smelly Cat.''

258
00:20:47,951 --> 00:20:52,883
I mean, if all you've ever actually
had are healthy pets, then whoosh!

259
00:20:54,818 --> 00:20:57,148
But it's not even that, you know?

260
00:20:57,385 --> 00:21:00,215
I played my songs
because it made me happy.

261
00:21:00,418 --> 00:21:04,350
Now it's just all
about the money, you know?

262
00:21:07,051 --> 00:21:09,142
People missed you in there.

263
00:21:09,418 --> 00:21:12,543
In fact, there was a request
for ''Smelly Cat.''

264
00:21:12,951 --> 00:21:14,417
Really? From who?

265
00:21:14,985 --> 00:21:16,974
Well, me.

266
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:22,077
I know it's not your big money song,
but it's my favorite.

267
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:29,813
Hi. Did I accidentally drop a condom
in your case?

268
00:21:33,585 --> 00:21:36,016
-It's kind of an emergency.
-Yeah.

269
00:21:36,951 --> 00:21:38,417
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

270
00:21:38,652 --> 00:21:40,845
Hey, Christine! I got it!

271
00:21:47,051 --> 00:21:50,040
I want to thank you
for being there for me.

272
00:21:50,252 --> 00:21:52,582
Sorry I almost broke your hand.

273
00:21:52,786 --> 00:21:56,582
That's okay.
I知 sorry I poisoned you.

274
00:21:57,552 --> 00:22:00,712
Remember when I jammed
a pencil into your hand?

275
00:22:01,085 --> 00:22:05,347
Remember it? What do you
think this is, a freckle?

276
00:22:06,385 --> 00:22:10,181
What about the time I hit you
in the face with a pumpkin?

277
00:22:10,418 --> 00:22:13,043
Remember, I stuck a broom
in your spokes...

278
00:22:13,218 --> 00:22:16,912
-...and you hit your head on a curb?
-No.

279
00:22:17,118 --> 00:22:20,141
But I remember
people telling me about it.

280
00:22:21,285 --> 00:22:24,877
-I hope Ben has a little sister.
-Yeah.

281
00:22:25,085 --> 00:22:27,950
And I hope she can kick his ass.

282
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:31,084
I知 gonna get a new Band-Aid.

283
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:34,917
How about when I cut the legs
off your Malibu Ken?

284
00:22:35,118 --> 00:22:36,516
That was you?

285
00:22:38,986 --> 00:22:42,043
They were infected.
He wouldn't have made it.

286
00:22:46,218 --> 00:22:47,616
My little nephew.

287
00:22:47,786 --> 00:22:49,445
Come here, little one!

288
00:22:50,252 --> 00:22:53,946
There's my little baby Ben!

289
00:22:54,152 --> 00:22:56,744
Hey, my little boy.

290
00:22:58,152 --> 00:23:00,516
Hey, he's not crying!

291
00:23:04,352 --> 00:23:06,875
Hey, he's not crying!

292
00:23:09,986 --> 00:23:11,383
Yes!

293
00:23:12,719 --> 00:23:14,810
There's still pie!

294
00:23:15,585 --> 00:23:18,017
I知 here. I知 here.

295
00:23:18,719 --> 00:23:20,708
How's my little boy?

296
00:23:21,153 --> 00:23:25,642
You want Daddy to change
your diaper? I know, I know.

297
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:30,380
Did you have fun with Uncle Joey
and Uncle Chandler today?

298
00:23:30,585 --> 00:23:33,676
Yeah. He rode the bus today.

299
00:23:37,086 --> 00:23:39,984
Big boy riding the bus--

300
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:42,682
Hey, I have a question.

301
00:23:45,318 --> 00:23:49,341
How come it says ''Property
of Human Services'' on his butt?

302
00:23:50,886 --> 00:23:52,545
You....

303
00:23:53,153 --> 00:23:55,744
You are gonna love this.

304
00:23:56,485 --> 00:23:58,542
Can you hold Ben for a sec?

305
00:23:58,752 --> 00:23:59,809
Come here.

306
00:24:00,086 --> 00:24:04,041
Stay back! I致e got kiwi!
Run, Joey, run!

307
00:24:09,318 --> 00:24:12,217
Smelly cat, smelly cat

308
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:14,975
What are they feeding you?

309
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:20,152
No, no. I知 sorry, it's:
Smelly cat, smelly cat

310
00:24:24,552 --> 00:24:28,212
Smelly cat, smelly cat

311
00:24:28,452 --> 00:24:30,248
-Better!
-Yeah?

312
00:24:30,452 --> 00:24:32,078
Much better. Good.

313
00:24:32,286 --> 00:24:35,683
Don't feel bad
because it's a hard song.

314
00:24:36,253 --> 00:24:39,117
-You want to try it again?
-From the top?

315
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:41,841
There is no ''top,'' all right?

316
00:24:42,052 --> 00:24:44,882
