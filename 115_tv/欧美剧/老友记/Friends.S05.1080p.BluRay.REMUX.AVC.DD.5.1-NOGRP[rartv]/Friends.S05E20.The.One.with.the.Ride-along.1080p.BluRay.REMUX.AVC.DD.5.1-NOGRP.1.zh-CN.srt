00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,080
But we have no right to erase his message.
但我們還是沒有權力 擅自洗掉給羅斯的留言

158
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,920
Look,I'm his sister and I love him. I don't want to see him get hurt.
我可是他的妹妹 我愛他，不想看他受到傷害

160
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,290
Doesn't that give me the right to control him?
得了 我這樣還沒有權控制…

161
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,920
Help him?
幫助他嗎？

162
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,130
He's not the one who needs help.
我覺得需要幫忙的不是他

163
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,930
She's obviously unstable.
艾蜜莉非常不穩定

164
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,570
She's thinking about running out on her wedding day.
她竟然想在結婚當天落跑

165
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:15,840
Okay,fine. But look at the position she's putting him in.
好啦，但你看看 她讓羅斯陷入了什麼處境

166
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,250
And what's he gonna do?
你要羅斯怎麼辦？

167
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:21,510
Run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?
難不成在艾蜜莉結婚當天 跑去破壞婚禮？

168
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,620
Who would do that?
誰做得出那種事？

169
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,860
Okay,fine. All right. But that was different.
好啦，不過這是兩碼子事

170
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,460
Although it did involve a lot of the same people.
雖然有很多人都是重複的

171
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,170
This is some twisted joke she's playing on him.
艾蜜莉顯然想用變態的笑話 來惡整羅斯

172
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,540
You are crazy. She sounded genuinely upset.
夠了，你瘋了 她聽起來真的很沮喪

174
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,000
I mean,listen.
你聽聽就知道

175
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,540
Your messages have been erased.
您的留言已經清除

176
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,440

00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,750
Well,that worked out well. Margarita?
這樣就省事多了 來杯瑪格莉特？

179
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,860
Okay,but we're safe, right? Nothing bad's gonna go down.
我們很安全，對吧？ 不可能會有厄運降臨

180
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,400
No. But that reminds me. Sign this.
對，不過我倒想起來了 簽一下這個

181
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,720
What is it?
這是什麼？

182
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,660
It just says you can't sue if you scrape your knee...
沒什麼，只是不能告到市政府頭上 就算斷腿...

183
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,530
...or get your head blown off.
...或者腦袋開花

184
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,010
Oh,hurry up. I want to sign that.
快點喔，我要簽

185
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,070
Here he comes.
好，他來了

186
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,910
What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?
他在幹嘛？搞什麼鬼？

187
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,140
What is it?
什麼？…怎麼了？

188
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,810
-ls everything okay? -What?
沒事吧？ 發生什麼事？

189
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:27,380
He sees us. Don't move. And don't look at him!
他看到我們了，別動 不要看他

190
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,610
Hey,it's okay. It was just a car backfire.
沒事的，只是車子逆火

191
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,440
Hey, look at that. You tried to save your buddy.
看看，你想用身體掩護朋友

192
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,840
You see that?

You see what he did?

Thanks,Joey.
喬伊，謝了

196
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,620
Hello?
那我呢？

197
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,890
Hi.
嗨

198
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,490

We should go.

00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,060
Oh,yeah. Right.
對，錢拿走

202
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,770
No. Monica.
不是啦，摩妮卡…

203
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,880
Monica,we have to fix this.
摩妮卡，我們得補救這個

204
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,210
What can we do? You erased the message.
我們無能為力啊 你已經把留言洗掉了

205
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,350
Yeah,but maybe I could call his machine and re-create the message.
或許我可以再打電話進來 重新假造一段同樣的留言

206
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,990
All right,okay....
我來試試…

207
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,280
Hello,Ross,this is Rachel Emily.

God,what is it with those two names?
天啊 我怎麼連名字都說不好

210
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:47,960
I do so wanted to say that I'm going to be getting married...
我打來只是要說我就快要…

212
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,370
...to another British person.

And I'm having doubts and scones....
我心裡很疑惑…

215

-I can't remember what she said. -Yeah,that's the problem with this plan.
我忘記她說了什麼 是啊，計劃的問題就在這裡

217
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,250
Rachel,come on. The message is erased, there's nothing we can do.
瑞秋，留言已經洗掉了 我們無能為力

218
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,910
He's never gonna find out.
羅斯永遠不會發現的

219
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,580
I could tell him about it.
我可以老實跟他說啊

220

If you want to be rational, I can't argue with you.
如果你想要這麼明理的話 我也爭不過你

221
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,890
All right?

222
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,930
Fine,tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.
你要說就說 我不想介入

223
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,030
Maybe that's Emily leaving the exact same message.
或許又是艾蜜莉打來的 她想說一樣的話

224
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:29,780
Hey,Ross,it's you. I just want you to remember this feeling.
羅斯，是你啊 我只是要你記得這種感覺

You are lucky to be alive.

So live every day to the fullest.

Love yourself, okay?

And also get stamps. Bye.

Play that message for Emily, and this problem goes away.
只要把這留言放給艾蜜莉聽 所有的問題就都解決了

230
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,720
Right?
是嗎？

231
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,090
Anybody want to meet a hero?
誰要來見見英雄？

232
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,460
John Glenn is here?
約翰葛林來了？

233
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,230
No. Joey.
不，是喬伊

234
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,640
Joey's never been in outer space.
喬伊沒有上過太空啊

235
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,370
We had the most incredible night.
菲比，今晚真是太不可思議了

236
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,870
-We're in the car -Wait. Hold on.
我們在警車裡… 慢著…

237
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:08,640

00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,680
Okay,go ahead.

239
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,290
So we're in the car,and bang! A shot was fired.
好…我們在警車裡 突然呯一聲 有人開槍

242
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,020
And Joey,with no regard for his own safety...
喬伊完全不顧自己的安危 

243
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,320
...throws himself on me.
撲到我身上保護我

244
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,620
My God!
天啊，喬伊

245
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,370
It was a car backfire.
那是汽車逆火放屁的聲音

246
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,070
But he didn't know that.
對，但是當時他並不知道 

247
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,000
Yeah,I didn't know that.
對，我不知道

248
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,910
It could just as easily have been a bullet.
那很有可能會是子彈的

249
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,170
Ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.
喬伊，有沒有想過要當警察？ 警界很需要你這種人

250
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,470
Who jumps at loud noises.
聽到巨響就嚇得跳起來

251
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,540
Wow. I could have died tonight.
我今晚有可能喪命的

252
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,650
Yeah,if the car that backfired had run over you!
對，如果那部放屁的車 把你碾過去的話

253
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:53,160
I'm gonna go home,before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.
我先回家去了 省得羅斯大談人生新發現

254
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:57,090
I do have a newfound respect for life.
我的人生的確有了新發現

255
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,770
Oh,my God!
天啊

256
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,830
Ross,I could have told you you weren't gonna die today.
羅斯，我早該跟你說 你今天不會有死劫的

257
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,570
What? You know when I'm gonna die?
你知道我為什麼會死？

258
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:15,210
-You want to get some dinner? -Sure.
親愛的，你要吃晚餐嗎？ 好啊，當然

260
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,580
You know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.
你知道嗎，若現在聽到槍聲 我一定會撲倒你身上

261
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,450
Maybe we should walk in a bad neighborhood.
是嗎？那我們或許應該 去窮兇惡極的社區散步

262
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,950
Okay.
好

263
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,350
Bye.
再見 再見

264
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,560
Cut it out.
羅斯，你別再鬧了

265
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:38,530
I'd hate to save your life and kick your ass on the same day.
我不想在同一天裡 先是救你又痛扁你一頓

266
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,240
Why'd you take off?
你剛才怎麼先閃了？

267
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,710
Just going for a walk.
我只是去散步 

268
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,410
Around the living room,whatever.
在客廳裡繞來繞去

269
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,990
-ls something wrong? -No. No,I'm just tired.
有什麼不對嗎？ 沒有，我只是累了

271
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,490
You know,from the walk.
走路走累了

272
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,090
You dove in front of Ross!
好吧 你撲上去救羅斯

274
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,890
Ross!
羅斯耶！

275
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,070
That's what this is about.
原來是這麼一回事

276
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,940
Oh,my God. You hate Ross!
天啊，你恨羅斯

277

I don't hate Ross.
我沒有恨羅斯 

278
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,280
Of course you do. I saved him. You're mad at me. It adds up.
你當然有！ 我救了他，你生我的氣 這樣全都說得通了

279
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,080
You want Ross out of the picture.
你想剷除羅斯？ 

280
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,780
What picture?
剷除什麼？

281
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:30,650
I don't know. But I don't like what I'm hearing.
不知道，但是你說的話很嚇人

282
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:34,820
I'm glad you saved Ross in the car backfire. But it could've been a bullet.
我很高興你在汽車放屁事件中 救了羅斯一命 但那若真的是子彈怎麼辦？

284
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,290
And you didn't try to save me.
你竟然救他不救我

285
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,530
You're upset because you think I chose Ross over you.
原來你是在氣這個 你以為我覺得羅斯比你重要

286
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:46,970
No,I knew you could take care of yourself.
不是這樣的… 我知道你能照顧自己

288
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,380
You know? I mean,Ross needs help. He's not "street" like us.
羅斯需要別人幫忙 他不像你我見過大場面

289
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:55,210
You'd risk your life for Ross before you would for me.
話說到頭，你寧願先去救羅斯 也不來救我

290
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,110
That's the bottom line.
這才是重點

291
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,040
No,not exactly.
不完全是這樣

292
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,880
All right,look.
好吧，好吧

293
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,120
I wasn't trying to save Ross.
其實我那不是要救羅斯

294
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,020
Okay?

295
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,960
My sandwich was next to Ross.
我的三明治在羅斯旁邊

296
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,890
All right?

297
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:18,470
I was trying to save my sandwich.
我是要救我的三明治

298
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,040
From a bullet?
怕它被槍打到？

299
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,410
-I know it doesn't make much sense. -"Much" sense?
我知道這說來沒啥道理… 豈止沒啥道理

301
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:29,810
Look,it was instinct! I just went for it.
錢德，那是本能反應 當下就撲過去了

302
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,420
You risked your life for a sandwich?
所以你冒命去救三明治

303
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,680
I know it sounds crazy...
我知道這聽起來很誇張

304
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:38,720
...but this is the greatest sandwich in the world!
但這可是世界上最棒的三明治

305
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,330
So you didn't choose Ross before me?
所以你並不覺得羅斯比我重要

306
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,000
No. I would never do that.
是啊，我絕對不會那樣

307
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,100
You're like my brother.
你就像是我的親兄弟

308
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,060
-Really? -Yeah.
真的？ 對

309
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:56,370
In fact,to prove how much you mean to me....
為了證明你對我的意義

310
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,020
Here.
給你

00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,250
-Thanks. -Easy, it's not a hot dog!

313
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,190
How good is that?

See?
看吧

315
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,760
What are you doing?
慢著，你在幹嘛？

316
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,700
You're showing me how much I mean to you.
你不是要證明我對你的意義？

317
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,270
With a bite.
是啊，咬一口來證明

318
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,540
Jeez!
你也幫幫忙

00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:44,587
嗨

320
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,580
What are you doing here?
瑞秋，你在這裡幹嘛？

321
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,780
Hey,you know what?

322
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,660
You are in our apartment all the time!
你動不動就往我們的公寓跑 

323
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,390
This is just a drop in the bucket,mister!
我這只是小巫見大巫而已

324
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,430
It doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here.
沒關係啦，重點是你來了

325
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:03,640
You're my friend and you're here.
你是我朋友，而你來到了這裡

326
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,250
Okay,just a little scared. What's going on?
好，我有一點點害怕 羅斯，你是怎麼了？

00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:15,010
The most amazing thing happened tonight.
今晚發生了最不尋常的事

328
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,950
I thought my number was up.
我還以為自己要去見閻王了

329
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,650
I had an actual near-death experience.
我真正面臨到了瀕死經驗

330
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,120
What happened?
什麼？…怎麼回事？

331
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:26,800
We were on the ride-along with Gary and somebody took a shot at me!
我們不是跟蓋瑞 坐警車兜風嗎？ 有人朝我開槍！

333
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,190
Really?
真的嗎？

334
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,530
No. A car backfired.
不是，是車子放屁

336

But I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And,Rach...

...I survived!

I want to experience every moment.

340
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,550
I want to seize every opportunity.

341
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:57,460
I am seeing everything so clearly now.
現在的一切都變得好清晰

342
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,860
Because a car backfired?
全都是因為汽車放屁？

343
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,530
Okay. Why are you here?
好吧，你來這裡幹嘛？

344
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,470
I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing...
我不知道這件事符不符合 你所謂的「把握今朝」

345
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,230
...but Emily called you today.
不過艾蜜莉今天打了電話給你

But it kind of got erased.
不過留言被洗掉了

349
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:19,710
I mean,there's something wrong with your machine.
你的答錄機有問題

350
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,320
What did she say?
那她說了什麼？

351
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,920
Something about having second thoughts about the wedding...
說什麼對結婚的事有點反悔

352
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,190
...and did you guys make a mistake breaking up?

And she wants you to call her.
她要你回電

354
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:33,720

That was a good thing that I told you, right?

Because she didn't want
因為你知道嗎？她不希望… 

360
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,180
Not important. Point is, I was right. Your decision.
那不重要 重點是我是對的，你自己決定

361
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:53,440

I guess I should call Emily.

366
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,690
No, that's not the right decision.
不對，你的決定不對…

367
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,400
That's not right.

368

...that woman made you miserable!

Do you really want to get back into that?

372
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,910
Okay,look. Yesterday...

...I wouldn't have even considered calling her back.

...I have a near-death experience?
我的前妻正好打電話來

376
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,910
That's gotta mean something.
這一定有所含意

377
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:34,720
That was not a near-death experience. That was barely an experience.
羅斯，那不是瀕死經驗 就連經驗都談不上了

378
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,160
You weren't there!
當時你並不在場

379
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:42,930
Maybe this is something that I'm supposed to seize, you know?

Okay. You know what?

00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:50,170
Maybe this is not about seizing stuff.

...getting back together with Emily.

388

Because I do want to seize some opportunity...

393
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,280
..."close call" day.

Oh, honey. No problem.

Wait, wait. The message is blinking.

397
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,190
Maybe you didn't erase it.

Hey,Ross,it's you

I want my money back.

404
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,320
Has Gary ever been shot at for real?
