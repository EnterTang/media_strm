1
00:00:00,086 --> 00:00:01,462
Come on, Joey!

2
00:00:01,713 --> 00:00:04,048
I told you everything I knew
last night.

3
00:00:04,298 --> 00:00:07,927
It's not that big a deal.
So they're doing it.

4
00:00:08,177 --> 00:00:10,805
I cannot believe you would say that!

5
00:00:11,055 --> 00:00:15,643
Sorry. Monica and Chandler
are making love.

6
00:00:15,893 --> 00:00:19,522
No, I mean, come on.
This is a huge deal!

7
00:00:19,772 --> 00:00:23,151
I need more details.
Who initiated the first kiss?

8
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:25,778
I don't know.

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,364
Is he romantic with her?

10
00:00:28,614 --> 00:00:30,992
I don't know.

11
00:00:31,617 --> 00:00:33,619
Are they in love?

12
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,247
I don't know.

13
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:37,999
You don't know anything.

14
00:00:38,249 --> 00:00:39,876
I know one thing.

15
00:00:40,126 --> 00:00:42,920
They did it right there.

16
00:00:43,755 --> 00:00:46,716
The One with Chandler's Work Laugh

17
00:01:35,932 --> 00:01:38,142
Could I have a scone?

18
00:01:38,393 --> 00:01:39,936
Want to hear some good news?

19
00:01:40,186 --> 00:01:42,188
Someone I know is getting married.

20
00:01:42,438 --> 00:01:47,527
Weddings are happy occasions.
Oh, it's my ex-wife, Emily!

21
00:01:47,985 --> 00:01:48,861
Sorry, man.

22
00:01:49,112 --> 00:01:52,448
- Here's your scone.
- Thanks.

23
00:01:53,908 --> 00:01:58,079
Stupid British snack food!

24
00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:02,417
Did they teach you that
in anger management?

25
00:02:02,542 --> 00:02:05,294
You know what might
help you deal with it?

26
00:02:05,545 --> 00:02:08,881
You two are in the past.
You can't be mad about the past.

27
00:02:09,132 --> 00:02:14,554
Are you still mad about, you know,
the Louisiana Purchase?

28
00:02:14,929 --> 00:02:16,347
Nobody's mad about that.

29
00:02:16,597 --> 00:02:20,810
Exactly!
Because it's in the past.

30
00:02:22,478 --> 00:02:25,815
Anybody going to eat that?

31
00:02:28,526 --> 00:02:32,280
Look at us all dressed up for the party.
What are we celebrating?

32
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,992
We had a lot of liquor
left over from Christmas.

33
00:02:36,242 --> 00:02:40,955
Our friends aren't here. We can be
a real couple. We don't have to hide.

34
00:02:41,205 --> 00:02:43,916
I know. I can do this.

35
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:47,295
And I can do this.

36
00:02:47,503 --> 00:02:50,048
We can't do that.

37
00:02:50,298 --> 00:02:53,217
Hey, Bing!

38
00:02:53,468 --> 00:02:58,097
Who's the pretty lady,
and what is she doing with you?

39
00:02:58,348 --> 00:03:00,767
I asked myself
that very question, sir.

40
00:03:01,017 --> 00:03:01,934
My boss, Doug.

41
00:03:02,185 --> 00:03:03,770
- This is Monica.
- Hi.

42
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,149
- This is my wife, Kara.
- Nice to meet you.

43
00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:12,403
Did you hear about the new law firm
working for us?

44
00:03:12,653 --> 00:03:15,490
Dewey, Cheatem & Howe.

45
00:03:18,534 --> 00:03:21,954
Let's go drink our body weight.

46
00:03:22,955 --> 00:03:24,332
What was that?

47
00:03:24,582 --> 00:03:25,625
That noise you made?

48
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,669
Oh, my work laugh.

49
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:28,836
Your work laugh?

50
00:03:29,087 --> 00:03:33,299
If you're going to survive this party,
come up with one too.

51
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:36,594
All right. Check me out.

52
00:03:36,636 --> 00:03:40,973
He says, "$30, Father.
Same as in town."

53
00:03:46,938 --> 00:03:49,732
Everybody at work loved you last night.

54
00:03:49,982 --> 00:03:52,944
And they like me more
just because I was with you.

55
00:03:53,194 --> 00:03:57,657
You repaired the damage
from when they met Joey.

56
00:03:57,949 --> 00:04:01,452
Doug wants to play tennis.
He never talks to me outside of work.

57
00:04:01,703 --> 00:04:05,540
Except for that time
at that strip club.

58
00:04:06,457 --> 00:04:09,585
Strip church.

59
00:04:10,211 --> 00:04:12,964
- I'll go find a racket.
- I thought you had one.

60
00:04:13,214 --> 00:04:17,301
I used to, but then Joey thought
it'd be fun to go hit rocks...

61
00:04:17,552 --> 00:04:20,346
...at bigger rocks.

62
00:04:20,596 --> 00:04:22,306
Do you have a tennis racket?

63
00:04:22,557 --> 00:04:26,227
I lent it to Joey and
I've never gotten it back.

64
00:04:26,477 --> 00:04:29,188
Good luck with that.

65
00:04:32,275 --> 00:04:33,401
What's up?

66
00:04:33,651 --> 00:04:36,154
Why are you here?
I thought you had inventory.

67
00:04:36,404 --> 00:04:38,823
I do, but I decided I'd take
a long lunch...

68
00:04:39,073 --> 00:04:42,577
...and spend some time
with my friend, Monica.

69
00:04:42,827 --> 00:04:45,371
You know, I feel like
we don't talk anymore.

70
00:04:45,621 --> 00:04:46,998
How are you?

71
00:04:47,248 --> 00:04:50,335
What is new with you?

72
00:04:52,337 --> 00:04:54,547
Not much. Work's good.

73
00:04:54,797 --> 00:04:59,469
We don't have to talk about work.
Talk about anything.

74
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,097
You know what?

75
00:05:03,348 --> 00:05:04,891
Let's talk about relationships.

76
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:06,434
What's going on?

77
00:05:06,684 --> 00:05:09,020
Nothing.

78
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,314
You go.

79
00:05:11,564 --> 00:05:14,901
There was this guy at the bank
that I thought was cute.

80
00:05:15,151 --> 00:05:17,737
But I don't anymore.

81
00:05:17,987 --> 00:05:20,615
That's juicy.

82
00:05:20,865 --> 00:05:24,035
You know what? I actually do
have a lot of work to do.

83
00:05:24,285 --> 00:05:27,789
You're sure there's just
not anything else?

84
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:31,417
I'm sure. Is there something
you want to talk to me about?

85
00:05:31,668 --> 00:05:34,462
No!

86
00:05:37,423 --> 00:05:41,052
If there was, I wouldn't tell you.

87
00:05:47,433 --> 00:05:50,311
Then what happened?

88
00:05:55,149 --> 00:05:57,151
You'll get your turn.

89
00:05:57,402 --> 00:05:59,946
- Hey, Pheebs. What's going on?
- Nothing.

90
00:06:00,196 --> 00:06:02,365
This is not over.

91
00:06:02,615 --> 00:06:04,575
No, no, no!

92
00:06:04,826 --> 00:06:08,246
I was up all night writing
this nasty letter to Emily.

93
00:06:08,496 --> 00:06:11,332
It was perfect,
and now it's all covered in...

94
00:06:11,582 --> 00:06:13,876
Actually, thanks!

95
00:06:14,127 --> 00:06:16,838
All right!
Ready to go to the movies?

96
00:06:17,088 --> 00:06:19,090
Actually, I think I'll skip it.

97
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,133
Really?

98
00:06:20,383 --> 00:06:23,845
I'll read my book.
I just want to be alone right now.

99
00:06:24,095 --> 00:06:25,388
Sure you don't want to?

100
00:06:25,638 --> 00:06:31,227
Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan.
They get mail and stuff.

101
00:06:31,477 --> 00:06:32,854
That's okay, Joe.

102
00:06:33,104 --> 00:06:36,232
Let's go, Pheebs.

103
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,416
Game!

104
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:58,379
I got to tell you, that partner
of yours is a real tiger.

105
00:06:58,629 --> 00:07:01,716
Are you all right?

106
00:07:02,467 --> 00:07:06,429
We'll just get
a little sip of water.

107
00:07:06,679 --> 00:07:09,390
Am I on fire today or what?

108
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:14,395
Those birds are browned,
basted and ready to be carved.

109
00:07:14,645 --> 00:07:17,940
Okay, easy, Martina.

110
00:07:18,149 --> 00:07:20,651
I think we should let them
win the next game.

111
00:07:20,902 --> 00:07:24,947
I'm sorry, I don't understand
what you just said.

112
00:07:25,198 --> 00:07:26,240
Let them win one.

113
00:07:26,491 --> 00:07:30,745
Are you crazy? We own those two.
Look at them!

114
00:07:30,995 --> 00:07:34,832
He can't even breathe,
and she's popping pills.

115
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,709
You're not giving them a chance.

116
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,004
They have rackets.

117
00:07:41,964 --> 00:07:43,758
We'll make this the last game.

118
00:07:44,008 --> 00:07:45,927
Yes, sir. Put me out of my misery.

119
00:07:46,177 --> 00:07:48,596
Are you sure you never played pro?

120
00:07:48,846 --> 00:07:49,972
Please let them win.

121
00:07:50,223 --> 00:07:55,520
I'll take it down to 95%,
but that's the best I can do.

122
00:07:59,482 --> 00:08:03,194
- Missed it!
- I got it!

123
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:08,074
Nice shot.

124
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,292
I got it!

125
00:08:18,543 --> 00:08:21,671
Long!

126
00:08:26,592 --> 00:08:28,803
I can't believe you let them win.

127
00:08:29,053 --> 00:08:32,348
Well, at least you hid
your feelings well about it.

128
00:08:32,598 --> 00:08:33,683
I was frustrated.

129
00:08:33,933 --> 00:08:34,851
It's my racket.

130
00:08:35,101 --> 00:08:36,352
Frustrated with you!

131
00:08:36,602 --> 00:08:41,107
If we hadn't lost, they would never have
invited us to dinner tomorrow.

132
00:08:41,357 --> 00:08:42,358
What bothers me...

133
00:08:42,608 --> 00:08:45,069
...is how different
you act around them.

134
00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:48,156
The throwing the tennis games,
the fake laugh...

135
00:08:48,406 --> 00:08:53,494
...the "See you later, Bing!"
"Not if I see you first, Doug!"

136
00:08:54,871 --> 00:08:58,166
I don't like "work Chandler".
The guy's a suck-up.

137
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,251
Because you said that...

138
00:09:00,501 --> 00:09:03,921
...I'm not putting out tonight!

139
00:09:09,635 --> 00:09:12,805
Something's wrong.
My brother doesn't stay out all night.

140
00:09:13,056 --> 00:09:16,726
Maybe we should check
the trash chute.

141
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:19,103
Ross couldn't fit
down the trash chute.

142
00:09:19,354 --> 00:09:21,606
That's right. He almost could.

143
00:09:21,856 --> 00:09:25,860
Which is exactly
how I got stuck there.

144
00:09:27,445 --> 00:09:29,530
Oh, my God!

145
00:09:29,781 --> 00:09:32,033
Where the hell have you been?

146
00:09:32,283 --> 00:09:34,494
Just, you know, out.

147
00:09:34,744 --> 00:09:39,415
Oh, out! God, I don't know
why we didn't think to check there.

148
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:40,958
What were you doing?

149
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:44,003
I went to a bar and then...

150
00:09:44,253 --> 00:09:47,674
...I just walked around for a while.

151
00:09:47,924 --> 00:09:52,595
You walked around all night
in the city by yourself?

152
00:09:52,845 --> 00:09:55,640
He hooked up!

153
00:09:56,057 --> 00:09:57,350
He hooked up.

154
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,770
I don't have to answer your questions.
I'm a big boy.

155
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,313
I can do what I want.

156
00:10:02,563 --> 00:10:05,358
He hooked up!

157
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:08,611
Tell us about her!

158
00:10:08,861 --> 00:10:11,864
Ross, you left your scarf...

159
00:10:18,246 --> 00:10:21,708
Hey, you guys.

160
00:10:29,507 --> 00:10:34,971
I know what you all are thinking,
but Chandler is in Yemen.

161
00:10:35,263 --> 00:10:38,391
I'm a young woman. I have needs.
I can't wait forever.

162
00:10:38,641 --> 00:10:42,270
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

163
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:47,066
So I'm asking you, please
just take a moment before you judge me.

164
00:10:47,316 --> 00:10:50,153
Nobody's judging you.

165
00:10:51,904 --> 00:10:56,159
Mr. Right-place-at-the-right-time...

166
00:10:56,743 --> 00:10:59,662
...call me.

167
00:11:06,753 --> 00:11:09,213
I know what you guys are going to say.

168
00:11:09,464 --> 00:11:13,634
You two would have
very hairy children.

169
00:11:13,843 --> 00:11:16,512
I didn't know you'd say that.

170
00:11:16,763 --> 00:11:18,681
Ross! Janice?

171
00:11:18,931 --> 00:11:20,850
All right. Hold on, hold on.

172
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,852
This is Ross.

173
00:11:23,102 --> 00:11:26,230
He's our friend.
He obviously went crazy.

174
00:11:26,481 --> 00:11:28,483
He obviously lost his mind.

175
00:11:28,733 --> 00:11:32,987
I didn't lose my mind, okay?
Janice and I have a lot in common.

176
00:11:33,237 --> 00:11:37,325
We've both been divorced.
We both have kids.

177
00:11:37,575 --> 00:11:39,452
Are you going to see her again?

178
00:11:39,702 --> 00:11:42,455
- Don't put ideas in his head!
- I will see her.

179
00:11:42,705 --> 00:11:46,292
Damn it, Phoebe!

180
00:11:49,045 --> 00:11:52,131
I have to tell you something
that I've never admitted.

181
00:11:52,382 --> 00:11:56,594
In high school, I made out with James
even though I knew you liked him.

182
00:11:56,844 --> 00:12:01,599
That feels so good to get off my chest.
Okay, you go.

183
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:05,687
My turn? What are you talking about?

184
00:12:06,604 --> 00:12:10,108
I know about you and Chandler.

185
00:12:10,942 --> 00:12:13,319
I overheard you
on the phone the other day.

186
00:12:13,569 --> 00:12:17,740
You said, "I'll tell Rachel I'm doing
laundry for a couple of hours."

187
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,910
And he said, "Laundry?
Is that my new nickname?"

188
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,037
And you said:

189
00:12:23,287 --> 00:12:28,835
"You know what
your nickname is, Mr. Big."

190
00:12:32,964 --> 00:12:37,385
You're writing yourself
a little play there, Rach.

191
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,638
Let me know how it turns out.

192
00:12:40,888 --> 00:12:45,226
I wouldn't know because I got
so freaked out I hung up the phone.

193
00:12:45,476 --> 00:12:47,854
Well, if you had kept listening...

194
00:12:48,104 --> 00:12:51,649
...you would have heard me
call him Mister...

195
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:53,818
...Bigot.

196
00:12:54,068 --> 00:12:57,280
Mr. Bigot.

197
00:12:57,822 --> 00:13:01,826
He tells the most racist jokes.

198
00:13:02,076 --> 00:13:04,329
All right. So that's it.

199
00:13:04,579 --> 00:13:08,291
There's nothing going on
between you and Chandler?

200
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:12,295
Me and Chandler?

201
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,716
Put your $20 down.

202
00:13:16,966 --> 00:13:20,178
First one to find
the tasty treat wins, okay?

203
00:13:20,428 --> 00:13:25,391
All right, let's get the contestants
out of their isolation booths.

204
00:13:25,641 --> 00:13:28,644
And they're off!

205
00:13:28,853 --> 00:13:30,980
Get your foot off my contestant!
Judge?

206
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:34,692
Judge rules no violation.

207
00:13:38,363 --> 00:13:42,533
It's so weird to say this,
but I just had a great date with Janice.

208
00:13:42,784 --> 00:13:45,161
- What?
- Are you serious?

209
00:13:45,411 --> 00:13:49,248
I opened up to her about all
the stuff that's been happening to me.

210
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:51,334
I mean, I talked for hours.

211
00:13:51,584 --> 00:13:52,710
It is amazing...

212
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,631
...to have someone give you
such focused attention.

213
00:13:56,881 --> 00:13:59,634
You don't need Janice for that.
You've got us.

214
00:13:59,884 --> 00:14:02,845
The duck gets the Nutter Butter!

215
00:14:03,096 --> 00:14:05,848
That's not a Nutter Butter.
That's an old won ton!

216
00:14:06,099 --> 00:14:07,392
Judge rules...

217
00:14:07,642 --> 00:14:09,602
...Nutter Butter.

218
00:14:09,852 --> 00:14:12,855
Tough call.

219
00:14:15,858 --> 00:14:20,613
Seriously, I strongly believe that
we should support President Clinton...

220
00:14:20,863 --> 00:14:24,242
...and her husband, Bill.

221
00:14:25,493 --> 00:14:27,203
How do you like your coffee?

222
00:14:27,453 --> 00:14:29,372
- None for me.
- A little sugar.

223
00:14:29,622 --> 00:14:34,752
I'll have Monica stick her finger in it.
That will sweeten it up.

224
00:14:37,797 --> 00:14:40,633
- That laugh doesn't give you a headache?
- You get used to it.

225
00:14:40,883 --> 00:14:42,301
I don't think that I can.

226
00:14:42,552 --> 00:14:44,971
This will be it for me
on the work things.

227
00:14:45,221 --> 00:14:47,598
I laugh at my boss's jokes.
What's the big deal?

228
00:14:47,849 --> 00:14:50,393
I'd rather not be with
this work-weasel guy...

229
00:14:50,643 --> 00:14:55,398
...when I can be with my boyfriend,
who I actually respect.

230
00:14:58,234 --> 00:15:02,655
I got to apologize for Kara's coffee.
I'd feel sorry for it in a fight.

231
00:15:02,905 --> 00:15:07,243
It's not strong enough
to defend itself.

232
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:11,914
Hear what I said?

233
00:15:12,165 --> 00:15:14,042
What?

234
00:15:14,292 --> 00:15:16,586
It's a joke.
What's the matter with you?

235
00:15:16,836 --> 00:15:19,881
Well, I just didn't think
it was funny, sir.

236
00:15:20,131 --> 00:15:22,383
Excuse me?

237
00:15:22,633 --> 00:15:24,761
- Well, I just...
- Honey?

238
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:28,222
I just don't think
you understood the joke.

239
00:15:28,473 --> 00:15:29,349
Really?

240
00:15:29,599 --> 00:15:33,936
I mean, it was really funny.
I just don't think that you got it.

241
00:15:34,187 --> 00:15:37,190
You see, Kara's coffee
is weak-tasting.

242
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,987
But what Doug did was imply
that it was weak physically.

243
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:48,284
- You get it now, honey?
- I think I do!

244
00:15:50,828 --> 00:15:55,041
- Thank you, Monica.
- I thought you could use the help.

245
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:58,920
Coffee in a fight!

246
00:16:02,757 --> 00:16:06,844
You mind if I read
my comic books in here?

247
00:16:07,261 --> 00:16:09,764
Sure. Why?

248
00:16:10,014 --> 00:16:14,852
Chandler and Monica are over there.
It's kind of hard to concentrate.

249
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:18,648
She just called and said
she was going to be working late.

250
00:16:18,898 --> 00:16:20,608
She keeps lying to me.

251
00:16:20,858 --> 00:16:26,447
That's it! I'm going over there
and confronting them right now.

252
00:16:35,623 --> 00:16:40,503
All right, so you're telling me
that I have to tell racist jokes now?

253
00:16:40,753 --> 00:16:42,714
I'm just not very good at this.

254
00:16:42,964 --> 00:16:45,758
I'm a terrible liar.
I hate having to lie to Rachel.

255
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:48,720
- But we're not ready to tell yet.
- I know.

256
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:53,683
Ever since high school, Rachel was the
one person that I told everything to.

257
00:16:53,933 --> 00:16:55,935
I miss that so much now.

258
00:16:56,185 --> 00:16:59,814
She's my best friend.

259
00:17:07,655 --> 00:17:10,742
Oh, my God, Rachel!

260
00:17:12,702 --> 00:17:15,830
What are you doing here?

261
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,209
Well, I actually came over here
to borrow this lamp...

262
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:23,004
...to look at my books.

263
00:17:23,254 --> 00:17:26,758
You know, see them a little better.

264
00:17:26,841 --> 00:17:29,886
Okay, great.

265
00:17:30,136 --> 00:17:33,556
Well, what I was doing
in Chandler's room is that...

266
00:17:33,806 --> 00:17:36,601
...I was cleaning it.

267
00:17:36,684 --> 00:17:39,103
He pays me to clean it.

268
00:17:39,354 --> 00:17:43,775
What a great way to make
some extra pocket money.

269
00:17:44,025 --> 00:17:47,236
When I said to you earlier
that I was at work...

270
00:17:47,487 --> 00:17:49,572
...I'm at my new work.

271
00:17:49,822 --> 00:17:53,701
Good enough. Right?

272
00:17:55,912 --> 00:17:59,123
I'll go look at my books.

273
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:03,628
Go get back to my new job.

274
00:18:08,216 --> 00:18:12,136
Congratulations on your new job!

275
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,354
Man, she is really gullible.

276
00:18:25,942 --> 00:18:28,069
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

277
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:30,863
- Actually, I should get going.
- You're sure?

278
00:18:31,114 --> 00:18:33,199
I can stay out as late as you want.

279
00:18:33,449 --> 00:18:35,576
I told you I'm on
sabbatical from work...

280
00:18:35,827 --> 00:18:38,788
Yes, yes. You did.

281
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:42,083
- Oh, man!
- What is wrong now?

282
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,377
This isn't what I ordered.

283
00:18:44,627 --> 00:18:49,173
Man! Can't anything
go right in my life?

284
00:18:49,424 --> 00:18:52,510
First, my marriage falls apart,
and then...

285
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,803
I know!

286
00:18:54,053 --> 00:18:56,681
You lose your apartment,
you lose your job...

287
00:18:56,931 --> 00:19:02,437
...your ex-wife gets married so fast!
And now the coffee!

288
00:19:03,896 --> 00:19:06,357
We need to talk.

289
00:19:06,607 --> 00:19:09,944
- Sometimes I feel...
- No, no, don't.

290
00:19:10,194 --> 00:19:12,822
I'm going to talk.

291
00:19:13,072 --> 00:19:14,490
I believe...

292
00:19:14,741 --> 00:19:17,535
...that the sun has set...

293
00:19:17,785 --> 00:19:22,540
...on our day in the sun.

294
00:19:23,624 --> 00:19:28,504
You're a very sweet person, Ross.

295
00:19:29,714 --> 00:19:31,049
Unfortunately...

296
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:36,888
...I just don't think I can take
another second of you whining!

297
00:19:38,306 --> 00:19:42,643
Let me make sure
I'm hearing this right.

298
00:19:42,894 --> 00:19:46,397
You're ending this with me because...

299
00:19:46,647 --> 00:19:49,692
...I'm too whiny?

300
00:19:51,569 --> 00:19:53,363
So you're saying...

301
00:19:53,613 --> 00:19:56,783
...I've become so whiny...

302
00:19:57,033 --> 00:19:58,660
...that I...

303
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:02,538
...annoy you...

304
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:04,499
...Janice.

305
00:20:04,749 --> 00:20:06,000
Well, yeah!

306
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:10,338
Oh, my God!

307
00:20:11,673 --> 00:20:12,757
Will you be okay?

308
00:20:13,007 --> 00:20:16,260
I am now.

309
00:20:26,854 --> 00:20:29,774
I guess, that's two out of three...

310
00:20:30,024 --> 00:20:32,735
...Joey!

311
00:20:41,244 --> 00:20:44,247
Dude, we got to talk.

312
00:20:44,497 --> 00:20:48,292
I want to tell you something before
you heard it from someone else.

313
00:20:48,543 --> 00:20:52,672
I hope this isn't too weird but...

314
00:20:52,922 --> 00:20:57,051
...I had a thing with Janice.

315
00:21:00,346 --> 00:21:01,764
You're not mad?

316
00:21:02,015 --> 00:21:03,182
Why would I be mad?

317
00:21:03,433 --> 00:21:06,602
Because there's certain rules
about this kind of stuff.

318
00:21:06,853 --> 00:21:12,108
You don't fool around with
your friends' ex-girlfriends...

319
00:21:12,108 --> 00:21:16,696
...or possible girlfriends
or girls they're related to.

320
00:21:20,658 --> 00:21:23,703
I am mad.

321
00:21:23,911 --> 00:21:26,372
But you know,
I'm going to forgive you.

322
00:21:26,622 --> 00:21:28,583
Because that's what friends do.

323
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:33,087
They forgive their friends when
they do everything you just said.

324
00:21:33,338 --> 00:21:34,589
Thank you.

325
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:36,466
But I want you to remember...

326
00:21:36,716 --> 00:21:40,595
...that I forgave you.

327
00:21:41,262 --> 00:21:45,808
I also want you to remember
that I let you live here rent-free.

328
00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:47,352
All right.

329
00:21:47,602 --> 00:21:51,064
And I want you to remember
that I gave you...

330
00:21:51,314 --> 00:21:54,317
...twenty-seven dollars.

331
00:21:54,567 --> 00:21:55,693
No strings attached!

332
00:21:55,943 --> 00:21:57,320
If you can't remember that...

333
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:01,824
...we should write it down.
Let's write it down!
