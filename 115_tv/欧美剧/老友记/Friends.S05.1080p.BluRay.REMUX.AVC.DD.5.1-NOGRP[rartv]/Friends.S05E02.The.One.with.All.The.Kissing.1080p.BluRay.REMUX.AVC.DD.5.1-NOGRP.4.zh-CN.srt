1
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,850
你全身泡泡好可爱
You look cute in bubbles.

2
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,790
你喝太多眼花了
You're just all liquored up.

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,520
是我，我进去了
Hey,it's me. I'm coming in.

4
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,510
我今天上班累死了
I've had a very long,hard day.

5
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:34,380
你提早回家
-You're home early. 

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,140
因为我的约会对象吐了一地
-Yeah,my date threw up.

7
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,940
我要去买炸鸡，你要不要？
Want some chicken?

8
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:40,850
不了，谢谢，再见
No,thanks. No chicken. Bye-bye.

9
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,660
你确定？有额外的脆脆的大米哦？
You sure? Some extra-crispy,dirty rice?

10
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,450
我最后一次说我不要了 出去，乔伊
For the last time,no! Get out,Joey!

11
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,790
知道了
All right.

12
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,200
你没事吧？抱歉，他死都不走 缠着我问要不要炸鸡
Are you okay? I'm so sorry!He wouldn't leave.He kept asking me if I wanted chicken.

13
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,460
炸鸡？
Chicken?

14
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,800
我想吃炸鸡
I could eat some chicken.

15
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:05,910
乔伊
Hey Joey

16
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:13,510
我要三块鸡、沙拉 豆子、可乐
Could I get a three-piece,some coleslaw,some beans and a Coke?

00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,880

我非告诉你们不可
-I have to tell you this story.

28
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,260
刚才载我来的司机…
I was coming over and this cabdriver

29
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,170
那人是不是叫做安格斯？
Was his name Angus?

30
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,170
什么？
What?

31
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,330
我们在伦敦碰到的计程车司机
He was a cabdriver we had in London.

32
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,840
好吧，总之…
All right. Anyway

33
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,140
他载我们去的酒馆叫什么？
What was that pub he took us to?

34
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:17,870
麦子酒馆
The Wheat Sheaf!

35
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,210
对，那里有一种啤酒…
And they had that beer....

36
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,010
柏丁顿
Boddington's!

37
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,140
就是柏丁顿
Boddington's!

38
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,710
菲比有话要说
Phoebe was going to tell a story.

39
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,980
他的帽子很好笑… 我不想说了
So he had a really funny hat.I don't want to talk about it.

40
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,770
罗斯，柏丁顿
-Hey. -Hey,Ross!Boddington's!

41
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,300
是啊
Oh,man!

42
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:46,370
若是能再喝一杯 要我走回伦敦都行
I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.

43
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,140
世贸附近的英国酒馆好像有
They have them at the British pub by the Trade Center.

44
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,210
回头见
Later!

45
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,470
瑞秋不是应该回来了吗？
Shouldn't Rachel be back?

46
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,280
可是班机在雅典误点
Her plane got delayed.

47
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,980
不过现在也该到了
But she should be here by now.

48
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,350
你跟她通过电话 她很生气吗？
So you talked to her? Did she sound mad?

49
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,390
不会，那是因为她喜欢我
No. But she likes me.

50
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:04,960
你丢下她让她独自飞到希腊去
You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.

51
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,620
我才没有丢下瑞秋
I did not "abandon" Rachel. Okay?

52
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,700
艾蜜莉出现在机场 我当然得去追她
Emily showed up at the airport.I had to go after her. 

53
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,740
我别无选择 毕竟她是我妻子，瑞秋是我妻子
I did what I had to do.She's my wife. Rachel is my wife.

54
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,310
是…艾蜜莉
Emily!

55
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,910
艾蜜莉是我老婆 我是怎么了？
Emily is my wife.Man,what is that?

56
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,120
你还没有艾蜜莉的消息？
You haven't heard from Emily?

57
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,690
我在机场追丢之后就没有了
Not since I lost her at the airport.

58
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,760
她竟然跑得比你快
I can't believe she can outrun you.

59
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,830
她是很快，好吗？
Hey! She's fast,okay?

60
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,390
你自以为能快过我？ 我们现在就去外头较量
You think you can beat me? Let's go! Outside!

61
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,990
抱歉，我太…
-I'm sorry. I'm just a little

62
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:44,930
慢了？
-Slow?

63
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,900
你要跟我比比吗？
Oh,you want some?!

64
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,870
走啊，去穿球鞋，我们去赛跑
Okay,get the shoes on! Let's go,man!

65
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,670
别激动，你跑得最快
It's cool,okay?You're the fastest!

66
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,110
嗨
-Hi! 

67
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,650
瑞秋 嗨
-Oh,my God,Rachel!

68
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,580
瑞秋，我很抱歉
Rach,I am so sorry.

69
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,150
非常对不起你
 I am so,so sorry.

70
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,090
罗斯，你没做错
Come on. You just did what you had to do.

71
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,160
嗨，菲比
Hi，Phoebe

72
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,160
就这样？你不生气？
That's it? You're not mad?

73
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,920
你应该很火大
 It must've been terrible.

74
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:16,330
火大？我可是在希腊
Terrible? Hell,I was in Greece!

75
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:20,430
那间饭店非常棒 海滩很美，人又和善
There was a nice hotel,nice beach,met the nice people.

76
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,370
对我瑞秋来说可不差
It's not too shabby for Rachel.

77
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:28,200
就这样？不生气？
So,what,that's it?

78
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:32,410
对，我没生你的气
We're cool. Totally cool.

79
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,610
谢谢，你真好
Thanks,Rach. You're the best.

80
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,520
你才好呢
Oh,no. You're the best.

81
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,390
我要去花店一趟
Oh,I got to go to the flower store.

82
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:44,460
听我说，大家都不肯说 艾蜜莉在哪里
No one will tell me where Emily is...

83
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,900
我决定买72朵长茎红玫瑰 送去艾蜜莉爸妈家
...so I'm sending 72 long-stemmed,red roses to her parents' house.

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,990
每朵代表我认识她 并且深爱她的每一天
One for each day I've known and loved her.

85
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,800
她一定会感动地软化
That should get her talking.

86
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:57,710
罗斯，写卡片时别忘了 对方是“艾蜜莉”
When you make out the card,be sure to make it out to "Emily."

87
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,110
瑞秋，太好了 幸好你在希腊玩得开心
It's good that you had such a good time in Greece.

88
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,520
什么？
What?

89
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,690
我在希腊才不开心
I didn't have a good time in Greece!

90
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,450
罗斯丢下我一人
Ross abandoned me!

91
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,620
我买不到机票回来 只好住在他们的蜜月套房
I couldn't get a plane out. I had to stay in their suite!

92
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,460
每个人都要来问我
People came up to me going,

93
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:24,260
“盖勒太太，你哭什么？”
"Mrs. Geller! Why are you cry?"

94
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:30,870
简直丢死人了，我真是个白痴
I mean,it was so humiliating!I felt like such an idiot!

95
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,310
这都是我的错
It's all my fault. 

96
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:36,850
你们知道为什么吗？ 因为我的决定都不对
You know why?Because I make very bad decisions.

97
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:37,920
不要这么说
Oh,that's not true.

98
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:42,010
就是这样，我没胡说 我跑去蠢伦敦追罗斯
Yes,it is true. I went after Ross in stupid London!

99
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,550
伦敦的确是个蠢地方！太蠢了
London is stupid! Stupid!

100
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:49,730
打扮得像个啦啦队长 倒追约书亚
I put on a cheerleading outfit to seduce Joshua.

101
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:54,460
约了四次会就叫他娶我 把他吓死了
Then I lost him because I asked him to marry me after four dates.

102
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:59,060
然后我还去希腊渡别人的蜜月
And then I went to Greece on somebody else's honeymoon. Okay?

103
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:02,440
你们觉得这些决定正确吗？
Do those sound like very good decisions to you?

104
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,740
我喜欢你的小辫子
I like your little braid.

105
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,140
我不应该做任何决定
I just shouldn't be allowed to make decisions anymore.

106
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,010
菲比，你说得对 我根本不该去伦敦
Phoebe,you were right. I should've never gone to London.

107
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,210
从现在开始由你帮我做决定
From now on,you make all my decisions for me.

108
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,310
不行，我以前就这么做过
Oh,no. I did that for someone once.

109
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,380
我不喜欢主宰别人的生活
I'm not comfortable having that power over someone's life.

110
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,890
那我来
I'll do it.

111
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,960
很好，莫妮卡 以后由你主宰我的感情生活
Fine. Monica,you are now in charge of my love life.

112
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,490
我该去上班了
Okay. I got to go to work.

113
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,010
瑞秋，很高兴看到你回来
And Rachel,great to have you back.

114
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,780
菲比
Phoebe

115
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,330
真开心
Always a pleasure.

116
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,140
瑞秋，亲爱的，你看
Rachel? Sweetie,look.

117
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,040
这是你跟乔伊在招待会的照片
Here's a cute picture of you and Joey.

118
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,440
他已经结婚了
He's married.

119
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,070
罗斯结婚了 我到现在还不敢相信
Ross is married. I still can't believe it.

120
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,880
亲爱的，抓旁边就好
Honey,sweetie,by the edges.

121
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,840
看来我只好接受事实
I'll just have to accept it.

122
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,780
这都要怪我
I mean,it's my fault.

123
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,590
别抓中间，指纹会弄脏照片
Edges! Fingers! Smudgy!

124
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:26,750
天啊
Oh,my God!

125
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,350
算了
That's okay.

126
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,530
我知道你心情低落 不是故意找我麻烦
 I know that you're very upset right now.I know that wasn't about me.

127
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,490
我看她就是跟她作对
I bet it was about her a little.

128
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:44,240
你要是肯放下罗斯一分钟 就会发现到处有帅哥
If you'd stop thinking about Ross...you'd notice there are great guys everywhere.

129
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,800
你看，例如甘瑟
Look. Gunther.

130
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,840
他既善良又可爱
He's nice. He's cute.

131
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,480
甘瑟的确…
Yeah. I guess Gunther is....

132
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,350
还有那边那个家伙
What about that guy over there?

133
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,820
记得吗？你以前 跟他打情骂俏过
That's the guy you flirted with at the counter.

134
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,730
我不知道…
-Oh,I don't know. I don't know.

135
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,160
你现在就去跟他说话
-You're going to talk to him.

136
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:09,320
我们说好由我发号施令 我命令你去跟他说话
I make your decisions,and I say you're going to talk to him.

137
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,230
好吧，你说了算
All right.You're the boss. 

138
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,500
看来我只好照办
I got to do what you tell me.

139
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,400
他听到这句话肯定上钩
Say that to him,and you're golden.

140
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,140
菲比
Hey,Phoebe.

141
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,840
伦敦的照片洗出来了
 We got our pictures back from London.

142
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,350
这张是所有人在伦敦塔拍的
Here's all of us at the Tower of London....

143
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,920
大家都在照片中
Here we all are.

144
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,850
有罗斯、乔伊、你…
There's Ross and Joey and you and

145
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,250
和我
And me.

146
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,820
你一定听烦我们说伦敦的事了
We've been talking about London too much.

147
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,900
是我不好，因为我去不了
Sorry,it's just because I couldn't be there.

148
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,560
我只能大着肚子 烦都快烦死了
All I get to do now is pregnant stuff. It bums me out.

149
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,370
很抱歉…
-I'm sorry. -Sorry.

150
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,670
你知道我伤心时都怎么做吗？
Know what I like to do? 

151
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,140
有时候事情不太顺利
It sounds a little corny...but sometimes when I'm bummed out,

152
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:59,240
我就闭上眼睛 想想人生实在挺美好
I like to just close my eyes...and think about what a wonderful gift life is.

153
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,690
有用吧？
See?

154
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,130
怎么样？
-What happened? 

155
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,460
总之我们东扯西扯
-A little of this,a little of that.

156
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,360
明天晚上要出去约会
I got myself a date tomorrow.

157
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:20,430
看吧？你就要忘记罗斯了
See? Didn't I tell you? You're getting over Ross already.

158
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,540
滚出去 “我们有权利拒绝服务”
Get out.

159
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,160
你怎么去那么久？
What took so long?

160
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,420
公事担搁了
I got caught up at work. 

161
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:44,090
不过我明天就辞职
But I'm quitting tomorrow.

162
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,290
谢谢你邀我过来
So thanks for having me over.

163
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,700
瑞秋
Rachel

164
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,170
菲比
Phoebe

165
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,250
再见
See you,man.

166
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,020
他发什么神经？
What the hell was that?

167
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,590
可能在伦敦学到的欧洲风俗
Probably some European goodbye thing he picked up in London.

168
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,660
那才不是欧洲风俗
That's not European.

169
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,030
比较像法式热吻
It felt French.

170
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,500
换我跟各位老友说再见了
Well,I guess it's time for me to say goodbye too,mon frere.

171
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,840
过来给我点甜头吧
Come here and give me a little sugar.

172
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,480
我玩得好开心
I really had a good time.

173
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,850
我也是
Yeah,me too.

174
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,250
看来今天要结束了
I guess this is it.

175
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,660
除非你想进来 好
Unless you want to come inside? Yeah

176
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:59,700
等等，我无法自做主张
Wait a minute. You know what? I can't decide this.

177
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,270
等我一下 好
Okay. Just hold on a second.

178
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,610
莫妮卡在吗？我有事要问她
Where's Monica? I have to ask her something.

179
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,650
她去洗衣服
Doing her laundry.

180
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,580
那是什么？
What's that?

181
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,490
我今天收到的包裹
It came in the mail today.

182
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:28,720
72朵代表我深爱艾蜜莉 的红玫瑰给剪成碎片
It's 72 long-stemmed red roses.One for each day I've known and loved Emily cut up into mulch.

183
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,930
真是糟糕
Honey,that's awful.

184
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,240
还好啦，莫妮卡要用来做香料
It's not so bad.Monica's going to make potpourri.

185
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:45,210
我要去淋雨散散心
I think I'm going to go wander out in the rain for a while.

186
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,680
外面没下雨
It's not raining.

187
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,810
我的运气真不好
I can't catch a break!

188
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,880
罗斯，你哪也别去
You're not going anywhere. 

189
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:58,050
就坐这里 我们喝茶聊天，好吗？
Sit right here.I'll make you some tea and we'll talk this out.All right?

190
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,200
大卫 怎么样？
Hey,Dave.

191
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:09,240
改天再请你进来 我的室友病得很重，再见
I need to take a rain check. My roommate is really sick.Okay. Bye!

192
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:19,610
亲爱的，听着，我知道你现在一定很伤心
Honey,listen.I know things seem so bad...and that they won't get any

193
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,180
瑞秋
Rachel

194
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,810
我可以跟你谈谈吗？
Could I talk to you?

195
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,250
我掉了几支袜子
I dropped some socks.

196
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,790
好
Ya

197
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,060
你哪根筋不对？
What is the matter with you? 

198
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:40,730
你又想跳回去自找苦吃？
Do you want to fall into the trap?

199
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,810
你根本没掉袜子
You did not drop any socks!

200
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,270
我刚碰到大卫 他说你打发他走
I saw Dave,and he said you blew him off!

201
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,570
你给我听好，这里由我当家
You listen to me!I'm calling the shots!

202
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,610
我要你离开罗斯去追大卫
 I say you leave Ross and go get Dave.

203
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,840
你到底想怎么样？
What are you doing?

204
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:56,780
其实我想…我打算…
Well,ultimately I was trying,you know,I wanted...

205
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:00,120
告诉他我还爱他
...to tell him that I'm still in love with him.

206
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,920
什么？你不准说
What? You cannot tell him that!

207
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:07,360
为什么？ 大家都喜欢听到这种话
Why? Why not?People love to hear that!

208
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,470
我爱你
Come on,I love you.

209
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,500
你不喜欢听吗？
-Wasn't that nice? -No.

210
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,700
这里由我做决定，我不准你说
I make the decisions and I say no!

211
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:20,300
你不能帮我做决定 因为我要开除你
You know what? No,you don't make my decisions,because...you're fired.

212
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,240
你不能开除我
You can't fire me.

213
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,750
你的事情由我来决定 我说：我没被开除
I make your decisions,and I say I'm not fired! Ha!

214
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,110
既然如此…
Well....

215
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,200
瑞秋，让我进去
Come on,let me in!

216
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,560
怎么了？
Having some trouble?

217
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,490
瑞秋把我锁在门外
Rachel locked the door.

218
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,800
你肯亲我，我就帮你撞开
I'll kick that door in if you give me some sugar.

219
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,510
罗斯，我有话要告诉你
Ross,there's something I wanna talk to you about.I just need to 

220
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,750
瑞秋，开门！
Rachel,open this door!

221
00:13:58,850 --> 00:13:59,910
门锁着吗？
-What,is it locked? 

222
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,480
别管她，听我说
-She's fine. Listen....

223
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:05,310
我可以在外面鬼叫一整晚
Rachel,I can do this all night if I have to!

224
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,790
要不要我去开门？
-You want me to get that?

225
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,920
别理她，我们说我们的
No. Just let her do her thing...and we'll do our thing. 

226
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,650
我要告诉你…
Because I really need to tell you

227
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,200
谢谢
Thank you.

228
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:26,000
瑞秋，我可以跟你谈谈吗？
Rachel? Can I talk to you outside for a sec?

229
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,480
不可以
No

230
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,180
我真的有话要跟你说
We really need to talk.

231
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:34,080
那就说啊 那我就说咯
Well,then talk.Okay,I will.

232
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:40,080
记得我们刚说你要做的事吗？
Remember that thing we just discussed that you wanted to do?

233
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,520
记得
Yes

234
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,990
什么事？
What thing?

235
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,320
瑞秋要去学摇摆舞
Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons.

236
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,230
我非常不赞成
Which I think is a really stupid idea.

237
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,560
因为这种舞很危险
It's dangerous. 

238
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:58,310
她一定学不会 而且搞不好还会撞伤人
She won't get what she wants.And who knows who she might end up hurting?

239
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,220
莫妮卡说得对 摇摆舞有点危险
Monica's right. Swing dancing can be tricky.

240
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:15,980
我要打电话取消 五只送给艾蜜莉的泰迪熊
I have to use the phone.I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily.

241
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,580
上帝啊，想想这个惨状
My God! Think of the massacre.

242
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:20,890
我就是要说
I'm going to do it.

243
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,090
瑞秋，我知道你认为我疯了
I know you think I'm crazy.

244
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,530
但是在你告诉他之前 至少找到一个人支持你
But before you tell him,try to find one person...who thinks it's a good idea. 

245
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,570
我打赌你找不到
I bet you can't.

246
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,110
可是… 拜托
But I…Please?

247
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,540
好吧
All right. Fine.

248
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,240
乔伊，我已经进来了
Joey! I'm in!

249
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,180
好，做得好
All right. Good deal.

250
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:51,920
瑞秋
-Hi. -Hey,Rach.

251
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,930
你找到谁支持你了吗？
-Did you find anyone who agrees with you? 

252
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:59,470
还没，我决定问男性的意见
No.But you know what? I think I need a male point of view.

253
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:00,700
乔伊
Joey.

254
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,100
你是男人
-You're a man.

255
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,610
货真价实
-You got that right.

256
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,940
你觉得我该告诉罗斯 我还爱他吗？
Do you think it would be a good idea if I told Ross that I was still in love with him?

257
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,140
不
Nope.

258
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,180
菲比
-Phoebe! -Hey,Phoebe.

259
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,920
菲比 怎样？
-Phoebe? -Yeah.

260
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:27,790
你上次说你都不能去伦敦 觉得自己遭大家遗弃
You know how you were saying you didn't get to go to London...and you were feeling left out?

261
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,660
如何？
Ya

262
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,730
我们很愧疚
Well,we all felt really bad about that...

263
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:35,570
决定大家一起去旅行
...so we decided to take a little trip together!

264
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,770
太好了
Oh,that's so nice!

265
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,900
要去哪里？…
How great! Where's the trip?

266
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:44,010
我们可以一起去野餐
Well,we thought we would all go to a picnic...

267
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,680
就去中央公园
...in Central Park!

268
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,410
中央…公园
Central Park?

269
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,890
对，大家一起去个一整天
All of us. All day.

270
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,820
什么鸟地方？！
That sucks!

271
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,320
那根本不算旅行 我才刚从公园过来
That's not a trip! I just came from there.

272
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:58,520
大家去中央公园有什么好兴奋
What'll we high-five about at the stupid park?

273
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:01,120
“好耶，就在我家旁边”
It's right by my house. All right!

274
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:07,330
我决定回家反省这个烂主意
I'm going home to bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.

275
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,500
等一下，热吻先生
Hold on a sec there,Mr. Kissy.

276
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:17,750
我一直想跟你讨论 你新学的欧洲民情
I wanted to talk to you about...this whole new European thing you've got going on.

277
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:23,120
你搞得我非常不自在 拜托你别再亲了
And I need to say it makes me very uncomfortable...and I just,you know,just stop it!

278
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,390
我只是想 介绍大家认识欧洲文化
Just bringing some culture to the group.

279
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:29,890
只要不要介绍到我嘴里就好了
That's fine. Just don't bring it in my mouth.

280
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,860
我都快吐了
It makes me want to puke.

281
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,270
各位，菲比来了
Hey,everybody! Phoebe is here!

282
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,700
菲比！嗨
-Phoebe! Woo! -Okay. Woo! Hi!

283
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:55,310
我们认为野餐的主意… 实在烂透了
Phoebe,we decided that the picnic idea was a little....It didn't have any.... Well,it blew.

284
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:03,460
所以今天下午决定 到大西洋城去渡周末
We thought that this afternoon we'd all go away for the whole weekend...to Atlantic City.

285
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,830
大西洋城，太好了 谁想到的？
Atlantic City! Oh,that's a great plan! Whose plan was that?

286
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:08,960
我
Mine!

287
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,430
等等，是我提议的
-Wait. It was my plan. 

288
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,470
错 我说我们应该想个新的计划
-No...I said we needed a new plan.

289
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,130
然后我想到要去大西洋城
And I came up with Atlantic City.

290
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,540
这就是新的计划啊
Which is the new plan.

291
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:26,250
大家一小时后楼上见
Why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour.

292
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,780
我要去打包了 我要摇着大屁股好好打包
I'm going to go pack. I'm going to go pack my ass off.

293
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,590
我去叫杯咖啡 因为我已经摇屁股打包完了
Well,I think I'm gonna grab some coffee because my ass is already packed.

294
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,150
瑞秋，我们走吧
Let's go.

295
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:45,460
我等一下再上去找你
You know what? I'll meet you in a minute.

296
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:49,230
不行，瑞秋，没有人支持你 所以你不能说
Rachel,you didn't find anyone,so you can't tell him.

297
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,400
无所谓
You know what? That doesn't matter.

298
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,100
你知道对方不能回应你的爱意 会有多痛苦吗？
Do you know how painful it is to tell someone you love them...and not have them say it back?

299
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,450
知道，我不在乎
I don't care.

300
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,250
好吧，可是我看不下去
I can't watch.

301
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,070
你在看什么？
What you reading?

302
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,170
报纸 上面说了什么？
Paper.Yeah? What's it about?

303
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:33,110
世界各地的新闻
Events from around the globe.

304
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,140
是啊
Okey

305
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,190
罗斯，我有件事要告诉你
There's something I have to talk to you about.

306
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:42,850
虽然大家都叫我别说
Everyone's saying I shouldn't.

307
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,900
但是他们都错了 有时候别人就是看不清楚
But I think they're wrong. People can be wrong.

308
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,020
当然，有一次上班时 我说放射性碳测定法太老旧…
Sure，Once at work...I thought carbon dating is fossilized

309
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,360
罗斯，我说正经的
I'm really trying to tell you something here.

310
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,600
说吧
Go ahead.

311
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,200
我这就说了，现在就告诉你
I think I'm just going to say it.I'm just going to say it.

312
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:15,380
我还爱着你，罗斯
I'm still in love with you,Ross.

313
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:34,180
我不知道现在该怎么回答
I'm not sure what to do with that right now.

314
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:42,480
怎么了？你跟我开玩笑？ 这就太恶劣了
What? Was that a joke? Because it's mean.

315
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:49,560
我很正经，不能再正经了
I'm so dead serious!I'm totally serious!

316
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,920
那你笑什么？
Why are you laughing?

317
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,820
因为我刚听到自己的话
Because I just heard it!

318
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,090
我听到了，而且觉得很荒谬
I heard it. And it's ridiculous!

319
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,970
毕竟你已经结婚
I mean....You're married!

320
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:03,560
你结婚了，我说这话太可笑
You're married,and it's just ridiculous!

321
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:07,510
我说话的时候似乎灵魂出壳
When I said it,I sort of floated up out of my body.

322
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:13,070
我的灵魂听到肉身说话
And then I heard myself say it,and then the floating Rachel....

323
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:18,650
瑞秋的灵魂认为 自己实在很白痴
I was like,"You are such an idiot!"

324
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,190
我的确已经结婚。我知道
-Well,I am married. -I know.

325
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:29,030
虽然婚礼后就没跟老婆说过话
Though I haven't spoken to her since the wedding.

326
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:34,030
抱歉，这不好笑
I'm sorry. That's not funny.

327
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:39,210
其实还蛮好笑的
Actually,it kind of is.

328
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,140
我老婆不回我电话
My wife won't return my calls.

329
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,180
我不知道老婆在哪里
I don't know where my wife is.

330
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:55,680
“罗斯，你老婆呢？” 我也不知道
"Hey,Ross! Where's the missus?" "Don't know!"

331
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,590
天啊
Oh,God!

332
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:07,100
你可以忘记我刚说的话吗？
You know what? Could you forget I told you this?

333
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:12,170
我不忘记也不行 因为事实是…
Well,I kind of have to.Because the thing is

334
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,210
事实就是你已经娶了艾蜜莉
The thing is,you know,that you're married to Emily.

335
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:21,250
事实正是如此
That is what the thing is.

336
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,580
天啊
Oh,God.

337
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:32,590
罗斯，我们还是好朋友吧 我说自己还爱你真是蠢毙了
Things won't be weird between us,right? Was that stupid?Me telling you that?

338
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,720
不会，我很高兴你告诉我
I'm glad you did.

339
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:43,230
就算日子很顺利 听到有人说爱你还是很开心
If nothing else...it's always great when someone tells you they love you.

340
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,070
我早说过了
That's what I said!

341
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,480
谢谢你对我这么好
-Thank you for being so nice.

342
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,740
我才该谢谢你
-No. Thank you for....

343
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:54,310
谢谢你
Thank you.

344
00:22:55,050 --> 00:23:00,180
幸好我没给你 我录的那卷录音带
Oh,God. I'm just glad I didn't give you the cassette I made of all of our songs.

345
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:02,380
你录了哪些歌曲？
-What songs? -Oh,you know:

346
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:05,120
“有没有你”
-"With or Without You." -Oh,yeah.

347
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,290
“大家都会受伤”
-"Everybody Hurts." -Oh,yeah.

348
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,600
“瑞安娜”
-"Rhiannon." 

349
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,360
为什么选这首？
-Why "Rhiannon"?

350
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,960
你不记得了？
Come on,you remember!

351
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:15,000
就是在客厅啊
 In the living room?

352
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:18,070
在莫妮卡洗好的衣服上啊
On Monica's laundry?

353
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,640
那不是我
Not me.

354
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,080
不是？
Really.

355
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:31,750
怎么样了？
So,what happened?

356
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,620
我很难说出口
Well,it was really hard...

357
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,020
但是幸好我说了
...but I'm glad I did it.

358
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,430
你做得对吗？
So was I right or wrong?

359
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,960
这种事情无关对错
-Oh,come on,honey,does it really matter? 

360
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,760
是啊 没错
-No -Right

361
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,700
但是我要记在记分簿上
Yes. I need it for my score book.

362
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,300
我是说日记
Diary.

363
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,200
大家走吧
-Okay,let's go! 

364
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,670
前往大西洋城
-Yeah,Atlantic City!Come on!

365
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,440
去大西洋城咯
Atlantic City,baby!

366
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:01,310
我们去大赌一笔 乔伊，赌博万岁
Let's roll some bones. Hey,Joey!High-five for rolling bones.

367
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,220
菲比，你尿失禁？
Phoebe,you're leaking.

368
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:10,620
天啊，你羊水破了
Oh,my God! Your water broke!

369
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,890
别放在心上，我要坐副驾驶！
Well,don't worry. I call shotgun.

370
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,760
等一下
Wait

371
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:19,840
菲比，我们得送你去医院
Phoebe,we have to take you to the hospital now.

372
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:23,130
去大西洋城路上应该有医院
Okay. Well,there's probably one on the way to Atlantic City.

373
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,540
菲比，你快要生了
Phoebe,the babies are coming now.

374
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,170
击掌，你要生了！
Honey! High-five! The babies are coming!

375
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:33,070
等一下，记不记得 我羊水破的那天？
Remember when my water broke?

376
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:40,420
菲比竟然快生了
I can't believe Phoebe's going to have her babies!

377
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,930
我知道，真是太棒了
I know. It's beautiful and amazing.

378
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,460
你知道吗，我竟然每次离开 都得亲菲比跟瑞秋
I can't believe I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left the room.

379
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,770
可惜她们没看到我们做爱
It's too bad they didn't see us having sex.

380
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,070
你到底了不了解女人？
Do you know anything about women?

381
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,570
不了解
No

382
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,410
算了 好
-It's all right. -Okay.
