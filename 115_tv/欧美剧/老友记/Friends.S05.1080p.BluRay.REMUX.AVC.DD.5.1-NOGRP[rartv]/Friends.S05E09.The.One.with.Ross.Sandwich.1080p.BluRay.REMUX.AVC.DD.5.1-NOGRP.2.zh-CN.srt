1
00:00:04,683 --> 00:00:06,241
我是坐到什么东东啊?
What am I sitting on?

2
00:00:06,485 --> 00:00:09,454
世界顶端?河堤码头? (歌词)
Top of the worId?

3
00:00:08,186 --> 00:00:09,949
Dock of the bay?

4
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:12,113
想不出来了
I'm out.

5
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:15,456
内裤
Oh, undies!

6
00:00:18,363 --> 00:00:20,331
老实说,谁的?
Whose are they?

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,694
谁的?
-Whose are they? -Not mine.

8
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:23,790
不是我的
Joey's! Got to be Joey's.

9
00:00:23,902 --> 00:00:25,563
是乔伊的,一定是他的

10
00:00:30,442 --> 00:00:31,431
的确是我的
They're mine.

11
00:00:31,543 --> 00:00:34,011
看吧?就是乔伊的,乔…伊的
See, Joey's. They're Joe-Joe-Joey's.

12
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,647
怎么会在这里?
Why are they here?

13
00:00:37,182 --> 00:00:38,479
我不知道…
I don't know.

14
00:00:41,053 --> 00:00:42,645
因为我是乔伊
I'm Joey.

15
00:00:43,722 --> 00:00:47,681
我生性龌龊 随便在别人家脱内裤
I'm disgusting.

16
00:00:44,823 --> 00:00:47,553
I take my underwear off in other peopIe's homes.

17
00:00:49,528 --> 00:00:52,463
快拿走,你哪里有病啊?
Get them out of here. What's wrong with you?

18
00:00:52,564 --> 00:00:53,929
对啊 好恶

19
00:00:56,201 --> 00:00:57,634
拿去啊
-Take them! -I got them.

20
00:00:58,704 --> 00:01:01,673
乔伊,你干嘛不敢碰 这是你的内裤
You can touch them. They're yours.

21
00:01:06,712 --> 00:01:09,044
钱德,借一步说话 好
ChandIer? A word?

22
00:01:16,822 --> 00:01:19,120
我受够了 不想再帮你们说谎了
I'm tired of covering for you two. This has got to stop.

23
00:01:19,224 --> 00:01:20,623
这种鸟事不能再发生了

24
00:01:22,594 --> 00:01:24,186
而且还是白色三角裤?
Tighty-whiteys? What are you, 8?

25
00:01:24,296 --> 00:01:25,320
你8岁吗?

26
00:01:26,632 --> 00:01:28,827
谢谢你,乔伊,感激不尽
Thank you, Joey, so much.

27
00:01:28,934 --> 00:01:30,663
我家不欢迎你
You're not weIcome, okay?

28
00:01:30,769 --> 00:01:32,066
我讨厌这样
Look, I hate this. You guys keep embarrassing me.

29
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:34,502
你们害我拼命出丑

30
00:01:34,606 --> 00:01:37,074
昨天瑞秋在这里的浴室 看到你的剃刀
Yesterday, RacheI found your razor in our bathroom.

31
00:01:37,175 --> 00:01:38,164
我不知道怎么回答
I said it was mine, and that I was pIaying a woman in a pIay.

32
00:01:38,276 --> 00:01:39,573
只好说是我的

33
00:01:39,678 --> 00:01:42,772
还说我要在话剧里演女人

34
00:01:43,882 --> 00:01:46,544
结果还得一不做二不休
Then one thing Ied to another, and....

35
00:01:52,024 --> 00:01:54,959
连脚踝周围都剃光了 那里很不好刮哩
And around the ankIes, that is a tough spot.

36
00:01:55,327 --> 00:01:57,192
没错,告诉你们,我不能…
It was. AII right, Iisten--

37
00:01:57,295 --> 00:01:59,559
我们要说谎也不好受
AII this Iying has been hard on us too.

38
00:01:59,665 --> 00:02:02,429
是喔,不过至少你们有上床
Yeah, I bet aII the sex makes it easier.

39
00:02:04,202 --> 00:02:05,692
那倒是
Yeah, actuaIIy.

40
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:09,804
瑞秋不仅把你的内裤 凑到我面前
MeanwhiIe, I get RacheI shoving your underwear in my face...

41
00:02:09,908 --> 00:02:12,968
还问什么时候 可以看我演出丑女人
...and asking when she can come see me star in Ugly Woman.

42
00:02:14,413 --> 00:02:15,937
我们下次一定会更小心
We'II be more carefuI.

43
00:02:16,048 --> 00:02:20,747
因为我们实在太甜蜜了 所以不想告诉别人
We don't want them to know because it's going reaIIy weII.

44
00:02:20,852 --> 00:02:23,946
搞不好就是保密才能这么顺利
And maybe it's going weII because it's a secret.

45
00:02:24,056 --> 00:02:27,856
我知道你觉得很怪 但我们都不太会处理感情问题
It sounds weird, but we're so bad at reIationships.

46
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:29,893
没错,帮帮忙 拜
-We are. HeIp us! -HeIp!

47
00:02:31,863 --> 00:02:33,592
好吧,不过…
AII right. But you do it with me once.

48
00:02:34,266 --> 00:02:35,893
你要跟我上床一次

49
00:02:39,771 --> 00:02:42,069
乔伊 就知道你不肯
-Joey! -Didn't think so.

50
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:46,773

52
00:03:32,424 --> 00:03:34,255
不能换个话题吗?
-Can we pIease just drop this? -But I don't get it.

53
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:35,485
可是我实在不懂
Does anybody eIse just take off their underwear when they're hot?

54
00:03:35,594 --> 00:03:38,722
别人一热也会随便 在朋友家脱内裤吗?

55
00:03:42,033 --> 00:03:42,829
菲比

56
00:03:42,934 --> 00:03:44,026
菲比 嗨,菲比
What are you reading?

57
00:03:44,136 --> 00:03:45,398
你在看什么?

58
00:03:45,504 --> 00:03:46,937
“咆哮山庄”
Wuthering Heights.

59
00:03:47,038 --> 00:03:51,202
我在纽恩大学上文学课 明天之前必须看完
I have to finish it by tomorrow for my Iiterature cIass.

60
00:03:51,309 --> 00:03:53,174
我不知道你在上课,真酷
You're taking a cIass? That's so cooI.

61
00:03:53,278 --> 00:03:56,509
上次上拉梅兹课很好玩
I reaIIy Iiked that Lamaze cIass I took.

62
00:03:57,282 --> 00:04:01,309
所以我决定换种课来上 换点比较要用脑袋
I thought this time I'd go for something more inteIIectuaI...

63
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:03,410
期末考又不用那么痛苦的
...with a Iess painfuI finaI exam.

64
00:04:04,823 --> 00:04:05,983
听起来很有意思
That sounds Iike fun.

65
00:04:06,091 --> 00:04:08,651
你也可以一起来
Oh, you shouId come with me!

66
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,990
就有人可以跟我一起坐了
Then I'II have someone to sit with.

67
00:04:11,596 --> 00:04:12,585
好啊

68
00:04:12,697 --> 00:04:15,530
不过你有时间看书吗?
Do you have time to read it?

69
00:04:15,634 --> 00:04:16,965
我高中就过那本了
I read it in schooI.

70
00:04:17,068 --> 00:04:19,434
一定很好玩 制片：珊

71
00:04:19,538 --> 00:04:21,096

00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:24,205
几点要上课?
But what time does the cIass start?

74
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:25,833
别吵

75
00:04:29,447 --> 00:04:31,176
嗨 编剧：安德鲁瑞屈、泰德柯恩

76
00:04:32,184 --> 00:04:33,208
你怎么啦?
What's wrong, buddy?

77
00:04:33,318 --> 00:04:35,786
有同事偷吃我的三明治
Someone at work ate my sandwich.

78
00:04:37,756 --> 00:04:39,348
条子怎么说? 导演：盖瑞哈瓦森
What did the poIice say?

79
00:04:40,826 --> 00:04:45,786
那是感恩节剩下的三明治 竟然给人偷吃掉
My Thanksgiving Ieftover sandwich.

80
00:04:43,895 --> 00:04:45,760
I can't beIieve someone ate it.

81
00:04:45,897 --> 00:04:47,762
不过是个三明治嘛
It's just a sandwich.

82
00:04:47,866 --> 00:04:49,424
不过是个三明治?
Just a sandwich?

83
00:04:49,534 --> 00:04:54,164
我今年30岁,已经离婚两次 还没地方可住
I am 30 years oId, okay?

84
00:04:51,503 --> 00:04:53,835
I'II be divorced twice and I got evicted.

85
00:04:54,272 --> 00:04:57,469
那个三明治是我人生中 唯一美好的事情
That sandwich was the onIy good thing in my Iife!

86
00:04:57,576 --> 00:05:01,842
结果唯一美好的事情 竟然给人偷吃掉
Someone ate the onIy good thing going on in my Iife!

87
00:05:03,648 --> 00:05:05,138
这件毛背心不错
That's a nice sweater vest.

88
00:05:06,985 --> 00:05:09,783
我还有材料可以再做一个
I have enough for one more sandwich.

89
00:05:09,888 --> 00:05:12,516
我本来自己要吃…
I was going to eat it myseIf, but....

90
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:17,425
太好了,真是谢谢你
Mon, that wouId be incredibIe. Thank you so much.

91
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:20,930
我到现在还不相信有人偷吃了
I stiII can't beIieve someone ate it!

92
00:05:22,234 --> 00:05:25,328
我还留了一张纸条在上面
Look, I Ieft a note and everything.

93
00:05:25,971 --> 00:05:27,666
“叩叩叩”,“谁啊?”
''Knock-knock.'' ''Who's there?''

94
00:05:27,772 --> 00:05:29,239
“罗斯盖勒的午餐”
''Ross GeIIer's Iunch.''

95
00:05:30,408 --> 00:05:32,706
“哪个罗斯盖勒的午餐?”
''Ross GeIIer's Iunch, who?''

96
00:05:32,811 --> 00:05:35,871
“这是罗斯盖勒的午餐 请勿偷走我”
''Ross GeIIer's Iunch. PIease don't take me. Okay?''

97
00:05:38,183 --> 00:05:40,481
你没被扁就该偷笑了
I'm surprised you didn't wear it home.

98
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,851
不想让别人偷吃你的东西?
Want to keep your food? Scare peopIe off.

99
00:05:43,955 --> 00:05:47,049
那就得吓跑他们 这是我在街头流浪学到的
I Iearned that on the street.

100
00:05:47,158 --> 00:05:50,787
真的?不然你怎么说,菲比?
ReaIIy?

101
00:05:48,727 --> 00:05:50,524
What wouId you say, Pheebs?

102
00:05:50,896 --> 00:05:54,491
例如“脏手少碰我的馊水”?
Stuff Iike: ''Keep your mitts off my grub.''

103
00:05:56,601 --> 00:06:00,901
罗斯,你以为菲比 当年是在演温苦女流浪记吗?
Do you picture Phoebe on the street with the entire cast of Annie?

104
00:06:03,308 --> 00:06:05,708
贴上这张纸条就没人敢偷吃了
This'II keep them away from your stuff.

105
00:06:09,748 --> 00:06:11,147
哇

106
00:06:13,051 --> 00:06:15,417
菲比,你真狠
Phoebe, you are a badass!

107
00:06:16,621 --> 00:06:19,283
下次再告诉你们 我拿刀捅条子的事
Someday I'II teII you how I stabbed the cop.

108
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,050
菲比
He stabbed me first!

109
00:06:20,158 --> 00:06:21,887
是他先捅我的

110
00:06:25,931 --> 00:06:29,697
布朗蒂姐是当代的杰出女性
The Bront? sisters were remarkabIe women for their time.

111
00:06:29,801 --> 00:06:31,962
当时是父系社会
They Iived in a patriarchaI society.

112
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,061
抱歉迟到,因为我太晚出门
Sorry I'm Iate, but I Ieft Iate.

113
00:06:36,942 --> 00:06:39,809
菲比,这本书在说什么?
So, what is the book about?

114
00:06:39,911 --> 00:06:41,344
你说你高中过
Didn't you read it in high schooI?

115
00:06:41,446 --> 00:06:45,075
对,后来我想起我开始看时 正好碰上要为球队打气
I started it, but then there was this pep raIIy.

116
00:06:45,183 --> 00:06:47,344
我又是啦啦队队长
And I was on top of the pyramid.

117
00:06:47,452 --> 00:06:50,512
就是这样啦…到底在说什么?
But anyway...

118
00:06:48,987 --> 00:06:49,976
...what's the book about?

119
00:06:50,622 --> 00:06:54,786
这是凯西跟希克里夫 的悲惨爱情故事
It's a tragic Iove story between Cathy and HeathcIiff.

120
00:06:54,893 --> 00:06:58,385
故事发生在英国可怕的山庄
It takes pIace on these creepy moors in EngIand.

121
00:06:58,496 --> 00:07:02,660
场景就代表 男主角性格中狂野的一面
Which I think represent the wiIdness of HeathcIiff's character.

122
00:07:02,767 --> 00:07:04,701
我对象征主义很有一套
I totaIIy get symboIism.

123
00:07:06,204 --> 00:07:09,469
这本书的主题是什么?
How wouId you characterize the theme of this book?

124
00:07:09,574 --> 00:07:11,337
看看找谁…瑞秋葛林
Let's see.... RacheI Greene?

125
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,050
这是个…爱情悲剧
I wouId have to say that it's a tragic Iove story.

126
00:07:21,152 --> 00:07:25,020
非常明显,不过你说得也没错
That's sort of a given...

127
00:07:25,123 --> 00:07:26,181
还有谁有意见?
...but, yes. Anyone eIse?

128
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,191
还有象征性的意义
SymboIism!

129
00:07:29,861 --> 00:07:39,668
狂野的场景…反映出 男主角性格中桀傲的一面
And the wiIdness of the moors...

130
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:36,099
...which I think, is mirrored...

131
00:07:36,334 --> 00:07:39,770
...in the wiIdness of HeathcIiff's character.

132
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:42,533
非常好
ExceIIent! What RacheI has shrewdIy observed here....

133
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,473
瑞秋读得相当透彻

134
00:07:46,378 --> 00:07:48,642
你根本就是照我说的回答
You compIeteIy stoIe my answer!

135
00:07:48,747 --> 00:07:50,772
亲爱的,随便读读就知道了
Honey, that was pretty obvious.

136
00:07:50,882 --> 00:07:53,112
你哪晓得?你根本没过
How wouId you know? You didn't read it!

137
00:07:54,619 --> 00:07:56,746
你有何意见呢?
What do you think? You in the bIue shirt?

138
00:07:56,855 --> 00:07:58,880
穿蓝衬衫这位同学?

139
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:05,662
我认为这个问题 有很多可能的答案
I think that yours is a question with many possibIe answers.

140
00:08:06,898 --> 00:08:09,162
那就麻烦你举出一个
WouId you care to venture one?

141
00:08:10,135 --> 00:08:11,932
你愿意说一个吗?
WouId you care to venture one?

142
00:08:13,405 --> 00:08:15,339
你是重复我的话吗?
Are you just repeating me?

143
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,738
你是重复我的话吗?
Are you just repeating me?

144
00:08:19,978 --> 00:08:22,446
好吧,我们看下去
AII right. Let's move on.

145
00:08:22,547 --> 00:08:23,946
好
Okay, then.

146
00:08:27,352 --> 00:08:30,651
你为什么不直接说你没看过?
Why didn't you say you hadn't read the book?

147
00:08:30,755 --> 00:08:33,155
我不希望他认为我很蠢
I didn't want him to think I was stupid.

148
00:08:33,258 --> 00:08:35,522
你看看你多糗
That was reaIIy embarrassing, what happened to you.

149
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,864
菲比 什么?

150
00:08:40,965 --> 00:08:44,025
你那张纸条真是了不起
Your note?

151
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,489
Amazing!

152
00:08:44,135 --> 00:08:50,096
不但没人敢碰我的三明治 而且还开始对我敬畏三分
Not onIy did no one touch my sandwich...

153
00:08:46,604 --> 00:08:49,402
...but peopIe at work are actuaIIy afraid of me.

154
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:54,076
还有人叫我疯子,疯子盖勒
A guy caIIed me ''MentaI.''

155
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,377
''MentaI GeIIer.''

156
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:56,443
我一直梦想有这种超酷外号
I've aIways wanted a cooI nickname Iike that.

157
00:08:57,982 --> 00:09:01,509
以前你最酷的外号 就是“尿裤子盖勒”
The best you got in high schooI was ''Wet Pants GeIIer.''

158
00:09:01,853 --> 00:09:03,787
那是饮水机喷到的
It was the water fountain, okay?!

159
00:09:05,757 --> 00:09:13,789
现在有人愿意帮我写报告 我爱什么时候交就什么时候交
Anyway...

160
00:09:08,526 --> 00:09:10,517
...peopIe are writing reports for me...

161
00:09:10,728 --> 00:09:13,253
...pushing back deadIines to fit my scheduIe.

162
00:09:13,898 --> 00:09:18,301
原来对人耍狠就可以呼风唤雨
I teII you, you get tough with peopIe...

163
00:09:15,934 --> 00:09:18,732
...and you can get anything you want.

164
00:09:18,937 --> 00:09:21,929
崔比亚尼,咖啡拿来
Hey, Tribbiani! Give me that coffee! Now!

165
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,317
今天真有意思
This was reaIIy fun.

166
00:09:34,886 --> 00:09:37,013
我本来还怀疑你会不会约我
I've been wondering if you'd ask me out.

167
00:09:37,122 --> 00:09:39,488
你还在怀疑吗?
So you stiII wondering?

168
00:09:40,325 --> 00:09:42,486
我们已经去约会啦
No. We just went out.

169
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:48,198
你真聪明,我喜欢
You're smart.

170
00:09:46,898 --> 00:09:48,729
I Iike that.

171
00:09:56,207 --> 00:09:58,300
还有蜡烛啊
Oh, candIes!

172
00:09:59,911 --> 00:10:04,007
这是什么?毯子?摄影机? 我的天啊
What is that, a bIanket?

173
00:10:01,412 --> 00:10:03,937
A video camera? Oh, my God!

174
00:10:04,115 --> 00:10:05,377
不是这样…等等啊
I can't beIieve you thought you'd tape us having sex on the first date!

175
00:10:05,483 --> 00:10:10,443
你竟然第一次约会 就想拍下我们上床过程

176
00:10:15,693 --> 00:10:16,785
你好

177
00:10:18,429 --> 00:10:20,954
乔伊,她刚说的…
Joey, is what she just said....

178
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,299
天啊,你还真打算…
Oh, my God!

179
00:10:23,434 --> 00:10:24,867
You're actuaIIy going--

180
00:10:29,807 --> 00:10:31,934
这是怎么回事?
What is going on here?

181
00:10:34,112 --> 00:10:37,741
而且钱德还在家 你是…你是变态吗?
And with ChandIer in the next room. What are you, sick?

182
00:10:42,554 --> 00:10:43,953
我是乔伊啊
I'm Joey.

183
00:10:47,091 --> 00:10:49,286
我本来就恶心
I mean, I'm disgusting.

184
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:54,293
还拍低成本的A片
I make Iow-budget aduIt fiIms.

185
00:11:05,376 --> 00:11:07,606
你们答应我要更小心的
You promised to be more carefuI!

186
00:11:07,712 --> 00:11:11,113
乔伊的好名声都给你们毁了
The good Joey name's been dragged through the mud!

187
00:11:12,984 --> 00:11:14,008
对不起 抱歉
We're so sorry.

188
00:11:14,118 --> 00:11:15,813
我要把你们的事情说出去
I'm teIIing everyone.

189
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,687
否则内裤跟摄影机的事情 只会让人觉得我是变态猪猡
It's the onIy expIanation that doesn't make me Iook Iike a pig!

190
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:22,922
等一下,一定有其他方法
No, there's a better expIanation.

191
00:11:23,027 --> 00:11:28,829
你可以说你在拍A片 因为你在…上A片课
TeII them you had to make an aduIt fiIm for your...

192
00:11:26,564 --> 00:11:28,828
...aduIt fiIm cIass.

193
00:11:30,201 --> 00:11:31,031
这理由还不错
I Iike that. But no!

194
00:11:31,135 --> 00:11:35,697
不行,瑞秋在你家 发现我内裤的事又怎么说?
How does that expIain my underwear at your pIace?

195
00:11:36,975 --> 00:11:37,805
不知道
I don't know.

196
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:41,804
看来你们得出柜承认了
Get ready to come out of the non-gay cIoset.

197
00:11:42,847 --> 00:11:45,111
拜你等等 我保证一定会想出理由
I promise to come up with something. Just give us time.

198
00:11:45,216 --> 00:11:46,706
再多给我们缓几天

199
00:11:47,585 --> 00:11:51,954
好吧,最好让我保住面子
AII right.

200
00:11:49,254 --> 00:11:51,814
But it better make me Iook reaIIy good.

201
00:11:53,324 --> 00:11:56,657
还有…摄影机?
And another thing:

202
00:11:54,993 --> 00:11:56,358
The video camera?

203
00:11:56,761 --> 00:11:58,752
神来之笔!
Nice!

204
00:12:03,101 --> 00:12:04,728
“史前历史博物馆”

205
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:08,837
罗斯,可以跟你谈谈吗?

206
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,237
当然,唐诺
May I have a word?

207
00:12:09,007 --> 00:12:10,304
Of course, DonaId.

208
00:12:11,342 --> 00:12:15,608
有同事抱怨你最近脾气火爆
We've been getting reports of very angry behavior on your part.

209
00:12:15,713 --> 00:12:16,372
什么?
-What? -Threatening Ietters...

210
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:20,247
写信威胁大家 拒绝按时交报告
...refusaI to meet deadIines.

211
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,343
还有人说你是疯子
ApparentIy peopIe now caII you MentaI.

212
00:12:24,555 --> 00:12:25,783
是啊

213
00:12:27,492 --> 00:12:30,461
我们希望你找精神科医生谈谈
We want you to speak to a psychiatrist.

214
00:12:30,561 --> 00:12:36,056
不,你不懂,其实是误会

215
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:35,231
You don't understand. This is so siIIy.

216
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:39,625
一切要从我的三明治说起
This is aII just because of a sandwich.

217
00:12:39,737 --> 00:12:40,704
三明治?
A sandwich?

218
00:12:40,805 --> 00:12:46,300
我非常会做火鸡三明治
You see, my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches.

219
00:12:46,411 --> 00:12:51,542
她的秘诀就是 多夹一片浸过肉汁的面包
Her secret is, she puts an extra sIice of gravy-soaked bread in the middIe.

220
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:53,583
我称那片为“多汁秘方”
I caII it ''The Moistmaker.''

221
00:12:54,385 --> 00:12:58,014
有一次我把三明治放在冰箱
Anyway, I put my sandwich in the fridge....

222
00:12:58,122 --> 00:12:59,555
你知道吗? 什么?
Oh, you know what?

223
00:12:59,657 --> 00:13:03,457
对不起,应该是我吃掉了
I'm sorry.

224
00:13:01,526 --> 00:13:03,221
I beIieve I ate that.

225
00:13:07,865 --> 00:13:09,799
你吃了我的三明治?
You ate my sandwich?

226
00:13:09,901 --> 00:13:12,062
我一时看错,谁都可能拿错
A simpIe mistake. It can happen to anyone.

227
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:13,728
是吗?
Oh, reaIIy?

228
00:13:15,773 --> 00:13:22,042
难道你的三明治 也有“多汁秘方”?
Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moistmaker?

229
00:13:22,146 --> 00:13:28,608
没有 难道你没看到上面的纸条?
Do you, perhaps, remember...

230
00:13:24,882 --> 00:13:28,443
...seeing a note on top of it?

231
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,850
我以为那是有人开玩笑 或是随手写的打油诗
There may have been a joke or Iimerick of some kind.

232
00:13:32,957 --> 00:13:37,758
上面清楚地写着那是我的
That said it was...

233
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:36,890
...my sandwich!

234
00:13:37,862 --> 00:13:39,591
你别激动
Now, caIm down.

235
00:13:39,697 --> 00:13:42,962
可以到我办公室找找 可能垃圾筒里还有剩
Look in my office. Some may be in the trash.

236
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:47,032
什么?

237
00:13:47,138 --> 00:13:48,969
那个三明治很大
It was quite Iarge. I had to throw most of it away.

238
00:13:49,073 --> 00:13:50,700
我哪里吃得了那么多

239
00:13:50,808 --> 00:13:56,041
你…丢掉我的三明治

240
00:13:52,443 --> 00:13:55,139
You threw my sandwich away?

241
00:13:56,147 --> 00:13:58,411
我的三明治
My sandwich?!

242
00:13:58,516 --> 00:14:01,417
我的三明治

243
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,978
嗨 嗨
What's this book about?

244
00:14:04,088 --> 00:14:05,817
这本书在讲什么?

245
00:14:05,923 --> 00:14:07,220
你这本也没看?
You didn't read it, either?

246
00:14:07,325 --> 00:14:11,091
我本来要看,结果看了别本书
I was going to, but I accidentaIIy read something eIse.

247
00:14:11,195 --> 00:14:12,025
什么?
Vogue.

248
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,461
“时尚杂志”

249
00:14:14,966 --> 00:14:16,900
这个简爱是干嘛的?
So teII me about Jane Eyre.

250
00:14:17,001 --> 00:14:18,764
不行,你应该自己看
No, read it yourseIf.

251
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,600
菲比,别这么假正经嘛
Come on, don't be such a goody-goody.

252
00:14:22,673 --> 00:14:24,698
好吧
Fine.

253
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:31,715
简爱呢…你会以为她是女人 其实不然,她是生化人
AII right. So, Jane Eyre?

254
00:14:27,412 --> 00:14:30,006
First, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not.

255
00:14:30,281 --> 00:14:31,646
She's a cyborg.

256
00:14:34,285 --> 00:14:37,652
生化人?就是机器人?
A cyborg? Isn't that Iike a robot?

257
00:14:37,755 --> 00:14:40,724
这本书在当时超级先进
This book was Iight years ahead of its time.

258
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,194
抱歉迟到,开始上课吧
Sorry I'm Iate. Let's get started.

259
00:14:45,296 --> 00:14:48,732
大家对简爱有何感想?
What did you think of Jane Eyre?

260
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:54,169
瑞秋刚跟我讨论过 她有些看法非常有趣
RacheI and I were discussing it, and she had very interesting insights.

261
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:56,697
请说,瑞秋
Go ahead, RacheI.

262
00:14:57,975 --> 00:14:59,203
谢谢你,菲比
Thank you, Phoebe.

263
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:07,844
简爱最让我震惊的就是 这本书非常惊世骇俗
What struck me most when reading Jane Eyre...

264
00:15:04,482 --> 00:15:07,645
...was how the book was so ahead of its time.

265
00:15:07,952 --> 00:15:12,048
如果你指的是女性主义 这么说也成
If you're taIking about feminism, I think you're right.

266
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:17,326
当然有写到女性主义 不过还有机器人
WeII, feminism, yes. But aIso the robots.

267
00:15:21,966 --> 00:15:23,831
嘿 嘿

268
00:15:23,935 --> 00:15:27,837
既然上次要拍摄不成功
Since that video camera thing didn't work out...

269
00:15:29,373 --> 00:15:33,434
我先给你一点预告片段
...I thought that I wouId give you just a IittIe preview.

270
00:15:34,745 --> 00:15:36,269
你没穿衣服
You're naked!

271
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,369
我知道
I know!

272
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,288
罗斯

273
00:15:51,395 --> 00:15:52,521
钱德

274
00:15:54,131 --> 00:15:56,156
摩妮卡

275
00:15:56,267 --> 00:15:57,825
罗斯,你没事吧?
Are you okay?

276
00:15:57,935 --> 00:15:59,197
我很好
I'm fine.

277
00:15:59,303 --> 00:16:02,670
我今天上班去看过精神医生
I saw a psychiatrist at work today.

278
00:16:02,773 --> 00:16:03,671
为什么?
Why?

279
00:16:03,774 --> 00:16:05,298
因为我脾气太暴躁
On account of my rage.

280
00:16:06,811 --> 00:16:10,008
而且最近越来越严重
Which, if I may say, right now is out of controI.

281
00:16:11,382 --> 00:16:13,145
所以他开药丸给我
He gave me a piII for it.

282
00:16:15,453 --> 00:16:16,818
药丸?
A piII?

283
00:16:16,921 --> 00:16:22,188
医生说我对上司大吼大叫 所以应该请假
When the psychiatrist toId me to take a Ieave of absence...

284
00:16:20,424 --> 00:16:24,724
...because I yeIIed at my boss, I started to get worked up again.

285
00:16:22,293 --> 00:16:24,818
我又开始暴跳如雷

286
00:16:24,929 --> 00:16:27,864
所以他要我吃颗镇定剂
So he offered me a tranquiIizer.

287
00:16:27,965 --> 00:16:30,297
我觉得这主意不错
And I thought it was a good idea.

288
00:16:30,401 --> 00:16:31,800
所以就吃了
So I took it.

289
00:16:33,938 --> 00:16:36,805
等等,他们逼你请假?
They're making you take time off work?

290
00:16:36,908 --> 00:16:38,671
而且你也同意?
And you're okay with that?

291
00:16:38,776 --> 00:16:39,743
我不晓得
I don't know.

292
00:16:40,845 --> 00:16:43,313
刚开始不工作可能不习惯
It's going to be weird not having a job for a whiIe.

293
00:16:43,414 --> 00:16:47,077
不过我已经不在乎三明治了
But I definiteIy don't care about my sandwich.

294
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,284
公司逼我看心理医生时 我也很火大
I hate it when they make me see the shrink at my office.

295
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:57,350
他老说“如果你多爱自己 同事就会更喜欢你”
He's aIways Iike, ''Your coIIeagues wiII Iike you better if you Iike yourseIf better.''

296
00:16:57,461 --> 00:16:59,019
谁需要这套垃圾?
Who needs that?

297
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:00,825
你啊 我知道
-You do. -I know.

298
00:17:03,467 --> 00:17:08,131
我丢脸丢大了 你竟然还让我说下去
It's so embarrassing! I can't beIieve you Iet me go on Iike that!

299
00:17:08,239 --> 00:17:09,137
对不起
I'm sorry.

300
00:17:11,976 --> 00:17:15,912
你把简爱比做机器战警 实在太爆笑了
It was so funny when you compared Jane Eyre to Robocop.

301
00:17:17,782 --> 00:17:19,943
一点也不好笑
That was not funny!

302
00:17:20,051 --> 00:17:21,643
我太气了
I snapped, okay? You weren't taking the cIass seriousIy.

303
00:17:21,752 --> 00:17:23,811
你根本不想好好上课

304
00:17:23,921 --> 00:17:26,151
菲比,这有什么了不起?
Come on! What is the big deaI?

305
00:17:26,257 --> 00:17:30,660
我以为我们就是一起出去 上课打发时间闹着玩
I thought it'd be something we couId do together.

306
00:17:29,126 --> 00:17:30,457
I thought it wouId be fun.

307
00:17:30,761 --> 00:17:32,092
好玩很重要
Fun is good.

308
00:17:32,196 --> 00:17:34,596
但是我也想学点东西
But I aIso wanted to Iearn.

309
00:17:34,699 --> 00:17:39,159
大家老说在高中学东学西 我却没上过高中
PeopIe taIk about what they Iearned in high schooI. I never went.

310
00:17:41,672 --> 00:17:44,436
所以你真心想上课
So you reaIIy wanted to Iearn.

311
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,870
但是我只想找点乐子
You know, Pheebs, I just wanted to have fun.

312
00:17:50,481 --> 00:17:51,641
你知道你该拉谁去吗?
You know who shouId go?

313
00:17:51,749 --> 00:17:53,478
我知道…
I know! I know! I know!

314
00:17:55,686 --> 00:17:59,178
摩妮卡,问题是你提的
Monica, you asked the question.

315
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,707
天啊,是摩妮卡
Oh, my God, that's Monica!

316
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:23,004
不是这样…你别误会

317
00:18:23,114 --> 00:18:27,346
离我远点,你这个大变态
You get away from me, you sick, sick, sicko!

318
00:18:27,451 --> 00:18:28,247
怎么啦?
What's going on?

319
00:18:28,352 --> 00:18:31,219
乔伊偷看大家
Joey has got a secret peephoIe!

320
00:18:33,157 --> 00:18:34,749
天啊…
-Oh, no! -Yes, he has a naked picture of Monica!

321
00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:36,850
他有摩妮卡的裸体照片

322
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:38,292
他拍下我们裸体的样子
He takes naked pictures of us, then he eats chicken and Iooks at them!

323
00:18:38,396 --> 00:18:40,489
还一边吃鸡块一边看

324
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:46,365
你们看 那是我老耶
Oh! Dude, that's my sister!

325
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:50,270
给我 等一下,大家先别激动
Give me that!

326
00:18:47,972 --> 00:18:50,304
Wait! Everybody caIm down, okay?

327
00:18:50,374 --> 00:18:54,970
要给我们的老友乔伊 有机会解释他为何如此病态
Let's give our friend a chance to expIain why he's such a big pervert!

328
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,844
我不是变态好吗?
I am not a pervert, okay?

329
00:18:58,949 --> 00:19:01,884
只是…我…其实…
It's just....

330
00:19:00,484 --> 00:19:01,473
I just kind of....

331
00:19:01,986 --> 00:19:05,615
大家听我说,我可以帮他解释
I think I can expIain this.

332
00:19:05,723 --> 00:19:07,054
谢谢
Thank you.

333
00:19:08,092 --> 00:19:09,957
乔伊是性爱狂
Joey's a sex addict.

334
00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:13,497
什么?才怪
What?! No, I'm not!

335
00:19:13,597 --> 00:19:17,294
没关系,不怪你
It's okay! It's good!

336
00:19:17,401 --> 00:19:19,392
这只是一种病
It's a disease.

337
00:19:19,503 --> 00:19:21,698
胡说,我才不是性爱狂
I am not a sex addict!

338
00:19:21,806 --> 00:19:24,274
你明明就是
Yes, you are!

339
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,969
这才能解释最近这一连串的事
That's the onIy way to expIain aII this stuff!

340
00:19:27,078 --> 00:19:28,943
事实不是这样
No, it isn't. It's not.

341
00:19:29,046 --> 00:19:31,981
你也可以说出真相
Because you couId aIso expIain it with the truth!

342
00:19:32,783 --> 00:19:34,080
什么真相?
What is the truth?

343
00:19:34,185 --> 00:19:36,346
怎么回事? 你在说什么?
-What's up? -What's going on?

344
00:19:41,926 --> 00:19:44,224
我跟摩妮卡上床了
I sIept with Monica.

345
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:53,933
听听大家怎么说?
WeII, Iet's see what everybody thinks of that.

346
00:19:57,141 --> 00:19:58,472
天啊

347
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:01,605
你跟我老上床?
You sIept with my sister?

348
00:20:02,913 --> 00:20:06,713
对,只在伦敦发生过一次
Yes, but it was--

349
00:20:04,215 --> 00:20:06,274
We just did it once, in London.

350
00:20:06,817 --> 00:20:09,115
这会让我开始抓狂
This is not good for my rage.

351
00:20:12,323 --> 00:20:15,588
摩妮卡,是真的吗?

352
00:20:15,693 --> 00:20:17,786
当然是真的
Is this true?

353
00:20:15,626 --> 00:20:16,888
Of course, it's true.

354
00:20:17,895 --> 00:20:21,524
否则怎么解释这些怪事?
How eIse wouId you expIain aII the weird stuff that's been going on?

355
00:20:23,734 --> 00:20:25,167
是真的
Yes, it's true.

356
00:20:26,704 --> 00:20:28,365
如果只发生过一次
If it happened once, how come we found your underwear in our apartment?

357
00:20:28,472 --> 00:20:31,532
你的内裤 怎么会出现在我们家?

358
00:20:34,078 --> 00:20:38,515
那件内裤是我当天在伦敦穿的 对不对,摩妮卡?
That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London.

359
00:20:37,314 --> 00:20:38,645
Right, Monica?

360
00:20:42,086 --> 00:20:46,750
我想留下来…当纪念品
I guess I wanted to keep it...

361
00:20:45,256 --> 00:20:46,416
...as a souvenir.

362
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:51,523
天啊,摩妮卡
My God, Monica!

363
00:20:51,629 --> 00:20:54,996
你确定,乔伊? 你确定你不是性爱狂?
Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?

364
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,659
要是有人是性爱狂 那也是摩妮卡
If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica.

365
00:21:02,139 --> 00:21:06,041
没错,打从我们自伦敦回来 她就想再勾引我上床
She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!

366
00:21:07,278 --> 00:21:10,304
所以她才拍裸照给你
That's why she gave you a naked picture of herseIf.

367
00:21:10,414 --> 00:21:11,847
这样说得通
That makes sense.

368
00:21:13,317 --> 00:21:15,444
录影机呢?
And the video camera?

369
00:21:15,553 --> 00:21:16,747
摩妮卡?

370
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:23,483
我架好录影机是为了 引诱乔伊上钩
I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.

371
00:21:24,962 --> 00:21:28,056
可惜我不吃这套
But, sadIy, I couId not be enticed.

372
00:21:29,567 --> 00:21:33,003
摩妮卡,你不能再这样下去
Monica, this has to stop now.

373
00:21:34,705 --> 00:21:38,163
我知道…不会的
I know, I know.

374
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,934
I know. I wiII, and I wouId appreciate if we aII couId just...

375
00:21:38,275 --> 00:21:44,214
希望大家立刻忘了这件事 以后再也别提起

376
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:44,774
...drop it immediateIy, and forever.

377
00:21:46,517 --> 00:21:48,985
只要你能抵抗我的魅力
Okay. That is, if you can resist me.

378
00:21:50,454 --> 00:21:51,921
我会尽量努力
-I'II give it my best shot. -Good Iuck.

379
00:21:52,022 --> 00:21:53,182
祝你好运了

380
00:21:55,059 --> 00:21:59,359
不可思议 你还留下乔伊的内裤?
UnbeIievabIe!

381
00:21:56,293 --> 00:21:58,921
You reaIIy kept Joey's underwear?

382
00:21:59,463 --> 00:22:01,863
为什么?你为什么这么做?
Why? Why wouId you do that?

383
00:22:05,736 --> 00:22:08,261
因为我是摩妮卡
I'm Monica.

384
00:22:08,372 --> 00:22:09,669
生性下流
I'm disgusting.

385
00:22:11,508 --> 00:22:14,966
我会跟踪男人 留下他们的内裤
I staIk guys and keep their underpants.

386
00:22:18,315 --> 00:22:24,254
现在终于知道谁是恶心鬼了
I think we've aII Iearned who's disgusting and who's not.

387
00:22:25,389 --> 00:22:29,257
好了,我要开始吃炸鸡了
Now, I'm going to get back to my bucket.

388
00:22:30,895 --> 00:22:33,989
我只吃鸡皮,你们可以吃鸡肉
I'm onIy eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.

389
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:41,870
你说得很有道理
You were making a good point.

390
00:22:41,972 --> 00:22:44,702
可惜后来被打断
I mean, tiII you got cut off.

391
00:22:44,808 --> 00:22:46,901
那个摩妮卡哪里有病啊?
What's up with that girI Monica?

392
00:22:47,011 --> 00:22:48,842
谁晓得?她不是我朋友
I don't know. I didn't come with her.

393
00:22:50,748 --> 00:22:53,478
好消息,各位 你们猜怎么了?
Hey, everybody! Everybody, guess what!

394
00:22:53,584 --> 00:22:56,018
我说服保罗下周考试
I just convinced CarI to give us a test.

395
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,382
考试?
Test?

396
00:22:57,488 --> 00:23:00,355
开心点,有考试才有进步
Come on! Tests make us aII better Iearners!

397
00:23:02,426 --> 00:23:05,657
对了,应该考申论题
Oh, yeah! We shouId have essay questions!
