1
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,470
不准这样，还住在我屋里 就得守规矩
None of that. Not while you're under my roof!

2
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:11,800
什么？
What？

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,900
就算我知道内幕 也不代表我喜欢看你们亲热
Just because I know about you doesn't mean I like looking at it.

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,240
你试镜不是还有一小时 才结束？
Aren't you supposed to be at an audition?

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,650
很抱歉我不是中年黑人妇女
I'm sorry I'm not a middle-aged black woman.

6
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:28,790
而且还走错试镜场地
I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition.

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,690
你们要我假装不知道 就得假装你们没怎样
If I pretend to not know about you...then you pretend there's nothing to know.

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,200
好
okay

9
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,420
抱歉 对不起
Sorry.

10
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,270
我听到了
I can hear that!

11
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,440
瑞秋还在上班
Rachel's at work.

12
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,710
我还是听得到
I can still hear you!

13
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,510

大卫修蒙

20
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,970
嗨
Hi

21
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:49,730
那是什么？
What's that?

22
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,830
我妈寄给我的原属于外婆的祖传宝物
My mom sent me an heirloom that belonged to my grandmother.

23
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,910
你们相信吗？
Can you believe it?

24
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:59,170
一年前我连家人都没有 现在竟然有祖传家产
A year ago I had no family,and now I have heirlooms!

25
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,280
我小时只有一条羽毛围巾
The only heirloom I ever got was a feather boa.

26
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,680
我爷爷传给我老爸再传给我
Got if from my dad. He got it from his dad.

27
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,050
真不知道我是怎么出生的 
How did I ever get born?

28
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,970
天啊
Oh,God!

29
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,540
好软
Soft.

30
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,070
这是貂皮吗？
Is this mink?

31
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,240
对，我妈为何寄皮草给我？ 
Why would my mother send me a fur? 

32
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,940
她完全不了解我吗？
Doesn't she know me but at all?

33
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:38,040
我已经有外套了 而且还没牺牲任何可怜动物
I have a fine coat that no innocent animals suffered to make.

34
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:43,110
只不过是时薪12分钱的 九岁菲律宾童工卖命做的
Just Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody...for 12 cents an hour.

35
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,790
别听我的，我胡说的
That didn't happen,I made that up.

36
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:51,760
嘿
Hey

37
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,130
罗斯，你不能在这里贴广告
Ross，You can't put up flyers in here.

38
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,400
为什么？别人都可以
How come? Everybody else does.

39
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,130
就是你不行
You can't.

40
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,680
什么东西？
What is that?

41
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,950
我要处理掉一些家具
I'm getting rid of some things.

42
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,310
这可是你的所有家当
This is all of your things.

43
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,720
没错
Yes,it is.

44
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,350
没关系，艾蜜莉说 我们应该买新家具
It's good. Emily thinks we should get all new stuff.

45
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,430
光属于我们俩的家具 也就是全新的东西
Stuff that's just ours. Together. Brand new.

46
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,900
基本上这是 “瑞秋碰过家具”大拍卖
So it's a get-rid-of-anything- Rachel-ever-touched sale.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,020
摸过、用过 坐过、睡过都不行
Touched,used,sat on,slept on....

48
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,830
我全买了
I'll take it all.

49
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,900
罗斯，你不反对？
You're okay with that?

50
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:36,880
只要顺着艾蜜莉 她来纽约后就没事了
If I can just do what Emily wants...and get her to New York,it will be fine.

51
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,210
但是这种做法也太极端了吧
Isn't that a little extreme?

52
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,280
毕竟我说错名字 你能怪她吗？
After what I did,can you blame her?

53
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,440
你已经算轻松了
You got off easy.

54
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:48,990
我朋友席薇的老公在床上喊错名字 结果遭到了她最恶毒的诅咒，那玩意都变绿了
When my friend Silvie's husband said another name in bed...she cursed him and turned his thingy green.

55
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,230
幸好艾蜜莉不会法术
I guess I'm lucky Emily is not magic.

56
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:59,030
她会，我们都会
Oh,she is.We all are.

57
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,370
他这是做什么？
What is he doing?

58
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,780
艾蜜莉觉得罗斯的家具 会沾上瑞秋的虱子吗？
Emily thinks Ross' furniture has got Rachel cooties?

59
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,480
乔伊，别激动
Calm down,Joey.

60
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,310
我偏要，事情搞得乱七八糟
Everything's getting all messed up!

61
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,350
艾蜜莉不准罗斯见瑞秋
Emily won't let Ross see Rachel.

62
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:24,550
可是我们会继续见瑞秋 因此罗斯再也不能见我们
We won't stop seeing Rachel.Hence,Ross stops seeing us.

63
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,820
我也不开心，一切都变了
I hate this. Everything's changing.

64
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:30,460
我知道，我们不能再见罗斯 乔伊还会用“因此”
We're losing Ross. Joey said "hence."

65
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,230
我也不高兴
I'm not happy about this either,

66
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,400
但是如果罗斯能开心
but if Ross says he's happy...

67
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,500
我们不该说出 自己对艾蜜莉的心情
...then we have to keep our feelings to ourselves.

68
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,370
大家愿意吗？
Are you cool with that?

69
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,810
不要
No

70
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,770
不过我是演员
But,you know,I'm an actor.

71
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,580
我可以装得无所谓
I'll act cool.

72
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:55,150
这真是我演过最难的戏
Probably be some of the hardest acting I've ever done.

73
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,420
我应该装上假胡须演
Maybe I'll play it with a mustache.

74
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,730
天啊，我怕死储藏室了
Storage rooms give me the creeps.

75
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,340
亲爱的，请快点
Please hurry up,honey.

76
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,840
瑞秋，你要吃小圆松饼 就得让我先找到煎盘
If you want little round waffles,wait till I find the iron.

77
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,950
我想吃小圆松饼
I want the little round waffles.

78
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,810
找到了
Here it is!

79
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:24,080
就在杀虫药下面
Right underneath the can of bug bomb.

80
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:28,750
锅碗瓢盆怎么可以 放在毒药下面
Is the best place to put something that cooks food underneath poison?

81
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,760
好吧，我吃土司就好了
You know what? I'll have toast.

82
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,970
天啊，喷他喷他
Fog him! Fog him!

83
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,870
我不知道该如何处置这件皮草
I don't know what to do about this coat.

84
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,070
可以给我
I'll take it.

85
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,340
好主意
That might work.

86
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,450
真好，怎样？你们觉得如何？
What do you think?

87
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,520
五分钟后换你上台 明妮莉小姐
You're on in five,Ms. Minnelli.

88
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:07,250
不…只是有点突然
No,it's just a bit sudden.

89
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,730
其实我很高兴，也全力赞成
It's great,okay? I am totally onboard.

90
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,600
我也爱你，好，再见
I love you too. All right,bye.

91
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,400
怎么了，罗斯？
What's the matter?

92
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:21,870
没事，其实是件好消息
Nothing. No,actually...great news!

93
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:26,940
我刚跟艾蜜莉通过电话 看来我要搬家了
I just spoke with Emily...and looks like I'm moving to a new apartment.

94
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,220
为什么？
Why?

95
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,080
她认为…而且我也同意
Her thought is,and I agree...

96
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:38,520
既然要换崭新家具 干脆换间公寓
...fresh new furniture,why not a fresh new apartment?

97
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,590
她表妹有个地方要分租
Her cousin has a place to sublet.

98
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,660
一边可以看到河 一边可以看到哥伦比亚
It's got a view of the river and Columbia on the other.

99
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,200
那是上城很远的地方 大概要转搭三站火车
That's way uptown! That's three trains away...

100
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,730
太棒了
...which is great!

101
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,170
我喜欢搭火车
I love to ride that rail.

102
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,430
你真的同意？
You're okay with this?

103
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,600
当然，离上班地点是有点远
It's kind of far from work...

104
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:00,200
但是我路上就有很多时间
...but I'll get so much done on the commute.

105
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:03,720
她算是送了我一份大礼 那就是时间
I've been given the gift of time.

106
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,580
有意思，上次圣诞节 我得到很多空间
That's so funny. Last Christmas I got the gift of space.

107
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,820
你和我的加起来就有个小宇宙了
We should get them together and make a continuum.

108
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,370
现在还要搬家？
Now he's moving?

109
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,700
艾蜜莉到底做了什么？
Man,what is Emily doing to him?

110
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,160
他又不在这里
He's not even here!

111
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,170
大家听我们说
You guys!

112
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,900
我们刚刚去储藏室 看到一个很可怕的人
We were in the storage area,and we saw this creepy man.

113
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,980
眼神凶残，全身毛茸茸
It was this crazy-eyed,hairy beast-man.

114
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,070
就像大脚哈利或喜马拉雅雪人
It was like a Big Foot or a yeti or something.

115
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,120
而且他还拿着斧头 瑞秋只好拿杀虫药喷他
He came at us,so Rachel used a bug bomb on him.

116
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,560
我拉开拉环拼命喷他
I pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass.

117
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,720
深色头发，满脸胡须？ 对
Like,dark hair,bushy beard?

118
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,270
你们喷的是丹尼
Yeah,you fogged Danny.

119
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,200
拜托，才不是丹尼
Please! We did not fog Danny.

120
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,270
丹尼是谁？
Who's Danny?

121
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,930
丹尼刚搬到楼下
Danny just moved in.

122
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,270
那家伙去安地斯山四个月 才刚回国，人很好
He just got back from a four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.

123
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:11,310
什么人很好…每次我们喷谁 你就帮他说话
He's nice. You know,you always...stick up for the people we fog.

124
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,130
什么事？ 嗨
Yep -Hi

125
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:27,070
你大概不记得 我们就是上次喷你的人
You might not remember us,but we're the girls that fogged you.

126
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,600
我们很抱歉乱喷一通
We're really sorry we fogged you.

127
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,700
好
okay

128
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:42,280
嗨，我们只是要告诉你 我们不是故意的
Just so you know,we didn't mean to fog you.

129
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,340
我们以为你是雪人或是怪物
We thought you were like a yeti or something.

130
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,620
好
okay

131
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,260
什么事？
Yes？

132
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,420
嗨，抱歉打扰你
Sorry to bother you,

133
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:59,060
但是你接受我们道歉的态度 让我们很难接受
but we can't accept your acceptance of our apology.

134
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,500
听起来一点也不真心
It doesn't really seem like you mean it.

135
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,730
对
Yes

136
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,730
好
okay

137
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:10,280
那家伙真恶劣
That guy is so rude!

138
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,810
没错，他哪里有病？
Really! What is with that guy?

139
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,140
换做我喷你，你早就原谅我了
You'd forgive me if I fogged you.

140
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,510
其实你有喷到一点点
You did,a little bit.

141
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,050
天啊，我很抱歉
Oh,my God,honey. I'm so sorry.

142
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,480
我完全不介意
-I totally forgive you. 

143
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,080
真的？ 对
-Really -Yes

144
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,160
嘿 嘿
Hey -Hey

145
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,720
你知道我那个开火葬场的 朋友克里斯吧？
You know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?

146
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,760
火葬场那个克里斯？当然
Crematorium Chris? Sure.

147
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,800
他说他愿意免费帮我烧皮草
He said he would cremate my fur coat for free...

148
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,470
只要我介绍下个要死的朋友 去那里火化
...if I bring in the next person I know who dies.

149
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:53,140
天啊…好漂亮的皮草
Oh,my God!Oh,my God. Look at these pelts!

150
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,690
别太喜欢，她要烧掉了
Don't get too attached. She's having it cremated.

151
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:56,880
什么？
What？

152
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,820
亲爱的菲比
Phoebe，honey

153
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:03,920
我知道你很怪 大家平时也欣赏你这点
You're quirky,and I get a big kick out of it. We all do.

154
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:10,060
但是你毁掉这么棒的皮草 实在是不合天理
But if you destroy a coat like this...that is like a crime against nature.

155
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,700
说错了，是有违时尚流行
Not nature. Fashion!

156
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,300
这叫做流行？
This is fashion?

157
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:17,210
尸体叫做流行？
So to you,death is fashion?

158
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,370
实在有意思
That's funny.

159
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:25,820
接下来菲比为各位展示 最新的毛茸茸尸体
Here's Phoebe sporting cutting-edge hairy carcass

160
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,750
这些动物死于寒冷的俄罗斯
 from,you know,the steel traps of wintry Russia.

161
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,660
你们真认为好看？
You really think this looks good?

162
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,460
因为我觉得不赖
Because I do!

163
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,600
我也想念你，希望快点见到你
I miss you too. I can't wait to see you.

164
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,970
我爱你，再见
I love you. Bye.

165
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,770
里面是什么？石头吗？
What is in here,rocks?

166
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,210
不，我收集的化石样本
No,it's my collection of fossil samples.

167
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,250
就是石头嘛
So,rocks.

168
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,460
我一定会想念这里
I'll miss this apartment.

169
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,390
小班就在那边学会走路
You know,Ben took his first steps right over there.

170
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,690
记不记得我上次撞到这里 还因此昏倒？
Remember when I ran into this and it knocked me out?

171
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,030
我很喜欢这间公寓
I love this place.

172
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,500
老实说，我真希望别搬家
To tell the truth,I wish I didn't have to move.

173
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:25,440
你的意思是你也不想走？
Are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?

174
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:30,610
如果艾蜜莉给我选择的机会… 你本来就有机会
If Emily gave me a choice…You do have a choice!

175
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,680
罗斯，你为什么要听她的？ 你疯了吗？
Why are you listening to her? Are you crazy?

176
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:35,450
什么？
What？

177
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,920
艾蜜莉这些要求太过分
It's not right what Emily wants you to do. 

178
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,960
她根本就是…
She's totally

179
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,050
不要再捏我了
Stop pinching me!

180
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,400
你们都说只要罗斯快乐 我就该闭嘴对吧
You guys said to keep my mouth shut if Ross was happy,right?

181
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,870
可是他刚说他也不开心
He just told me that he's not entirely happy.

182
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,800
这是怎么回事？
What's going on?

183
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,210
我们都讨厌艾蜜莉
We all hate Emily!

184
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,270
不
No,

185
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,040
罗斯，我们不讨厌艾蜜莉
Ross,we do not hate Emily.

186
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:07,140
我们只是认为你为了讨她开心 牺牲太多
We just think that you're having to sacrifice...a whole lot to make her happy.

187
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,520
对
Yes

188
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,120
大家都认为她有点不可理喻
We just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.

189
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,990
对，就是不可理喻
Yes,unreasonable.

190
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,260
不可理喻？
Unreasonable?

191
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:22,390
要是以后你们谁结婚 大伙也有这种反应呢？
How about we have this conversation when one of you marries?

192
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,800
你们根本不知道如何维持婚姻
You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work.

193
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,770
婚姻就是互相妥协 永远都会开心吗？不会
It's compromise. Do you always like it? No.

194
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,970
但是你愿意吗？愿意
Do you do it? Yes.

195
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:35,640
因为婚姻不是只有欢乐 只有梦幻，只管上咖啡馆
Because it's not all laughing,happy,candy in the sky...coffee at Central Perk.

196
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,080
婚姻是真实生活
It's real life,okay?

197
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,090
婚姻只适合成年人
It's what grownups do.

198
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,720
他说得有道理
I think he's right.

199
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:51,960
你们太常泡咖啡馆了
You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.

200
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,710
我对罗斯很抱歉
-I feel so guilty about Ross. 

201
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,210
我知道
-I know.

202
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,330
我觉得似乎都怪我
I kind of feel like it's my fault.

203
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:07,700
似乎？
Kind of?

204
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,150
要不是你大嘴巴 也不会有这种下场
If you just kept this to yourself none of this would have happened.

205
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:15,810
我最近知道的秘密太多 总有说溜嘴的时候
I'm keeping so many things to myself,something was bound to slip out!

206
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,150
其实你很勇敢
I think it's very brave what you said.

207
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:26,160
我坐不住了，我得去走走
I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.

208
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:29,760
菲比，你怎么还穿那件外套？ 你不是关心动物吗？
What's with the coat? How about the animal rights thing?

209
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,400
我最近读了一些书
I've been reading up,

210
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:35,370
告诉你们，貂不是好动物
and for your information...minks aren't very nice.

211
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,640
所以给人杀死活该？
-So they deserve to be killed? 

212
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,610
貂真的很坏
-Well,they are real bad.

213
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:47,120
好，我承认，我喜欢这件外套
Okay,I admit it. I love this coat,okay?

214
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:52,120
这是裹在我身上最棒的东西 菲尔杭利的拥抱都不够好
It's the best thing I ever had wrapped around me,including Phil Huntley.

215
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:55,430
你还记得菲尔吗？ 他很不错
Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine.

216
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,770
嗨
Hi

217
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,580
原来你比较喜欢短发
So you like the short hair better?

218
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,540
什么？
What？

219
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:18,310
雪人…丹尼？
Yeti? Danny?

220
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:24,650
我得剪头发 因为杀虫剂的味道洗不掉
I had to cut my hair to get rid of...the fogger smell.

221
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:29,890
抱歉，我绝对不会乱喷
Listen,I'm so sorry. I would have never fogged you...

222
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,400
要不是你的样子实在…
...if you hadn't looked so....

223
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,690
当然
Absolutely.

224
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,360
有些人只会以貌取人
 Some people are just into appearances.

225
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,500
什么？
What?

226
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,600
没关系，无所谓
It's cool.

227
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:44,200
什么？等等，什么无所谓 你根本不了解我
No,that is not cool.You don't even know me.

228
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:47,370
你提着一堆购物袋 还拿着百货公司目录
You got the shopping bags and the Saks catalog.

229
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,680
你以为这样就能看透我？
From that,you've got me all figured out?

230
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,250
才怪
Well,you don't.

231
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:57,480
搞不好我的袋子里装满 要给贫困儿童的玩具
You know,I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here.

232
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,560
是吗？
Do you?

233
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,220
如果他们喜欢拿紧身裤当玩具
You know,if kids like to play with capri pants.

234
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,090
好
okay

235
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,460
不准你再说这话，很刺耳
Stop saying that. I hate that!

236
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:10,730
好
okay

237
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,380
好，我不该光看你外表
Fine，I judged you.

238
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,580
当时我只靠第一印象 可是你也一样
 I made a snap judgment.But you did it too, 

239
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:26,550
而且更糟糕
and you're worse.

240
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:29,380
因为你只相信第一印象
You're sticking to your judgment.

241
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:34,760
甚至不肯反省自己对不对 你有什么资格说别人？
You can't even open your mind to see you might be wrong.What does that say about you?

242
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,830
对面那家披萨店好吃吗？
That pizza place across the street any good?

243
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,400
什么？ 我饿了，要不要去吃披萨？
What -I'm hungry. You want some pizza?

244
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,330
你还想骂人也可以继续吼
You can keep yelling.

245
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,870
好
okay

246
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:46,970
好
okay

247
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:49,040
不准说这话，很刺耳
Stop saying that. I hate that.

248
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,310
罗斯？
Ross

249
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,780
你还在生我们的气吗？ 对
Are you still mad?

250
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,650
很好，因为我们写了一首 “很抱歉”的歌
Good! We have an "I'm Sorry" song.

251
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,520
告诉你们，我现在心情不好
You know what? I'm not in the mood.

252
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:07,320
罗斯，我很难过
Look,Ross.I feel really bad. 

253
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:12,300
你生活发生巨大改变 我却乱讲话
You're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.

254
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,200
对，我们都很对不起
-We are so sorry. 

255
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,290
你们说出歌词了
-You're stepping on the song.

256
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:21,540
我们实在太离谱了 其实我们都站在你这边
We were way out of line,all right? We totally support you.

257
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,080
无论你做什么决定 我们都赞成
Whatever you decide,whatever you do.

258
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,740
歌词被你们说完了 我还唱什么？
Now you're just taking lines out of the song.

259
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,820
搬家已经够难过了
This is hard enough,okay? 

260
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,150
现在真的很需要你们
I really need you guys right now.

261
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,740
没错，所以我们才要…
Yes,exactly! And that's why....

262
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,960
你今晚过来 我帮你煮几道你爱吃的菜
Why don't you come over tonight,and I'll make your favorite dinner.

263
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,220
好
okay

264
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,170
谢谢你们
Thanks,you guys.

265
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,830
菲比，你身上这件是貂皮吗？
Are you wearing fur?

266
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:53,840
别再大惊小怪了，这又不是 用导盲犬的皮做的
Let's get some perspective,people.It's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!

267
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:03,220
罗斯，我知道 我为什么突然爆发了
You know,I think I kind of understand why I lost it today.

268
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,480
是吗？
You do,huh?

269
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:08,420
你知道我是个演员
You see...I'm an actor,right?

270
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,520
所以我的情绪比较丰富 你了解吗？
So I got to keep my emotions right at the surface.

271
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:16,460
我要同时面临多种情绪 你懂吗？
I got a lot of balls in the air,you know?

272
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:23,090
我这种人的生活实在不容易 必须到处流浪，孤孤单单…
It's tough. Guys like me,you wander around,you're alone.

273
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:26,030
你想说什么？
What are you talking about?

274
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,040
我也不晓得
I'm not sure.

275
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,580
嗨
Hi

276
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,240
看看你，你刚上哪去了？
Look at you! Where have you been?

277
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:36,320
我去吃披萨，跟丹尼去
I went to have pizza.With Danny.

278
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,580
怎么可能？
-How did that happen? 

279
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,850
那个雪人口才真好
-That yeti is one smooth talker.

280
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:44,860
雪人都是这样 所以从来没人能拍下雪人的照片
Yetis are smooth-talkers. That's why you never see any pictures of them.

281
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,830
乖，宝贝，把照相机交给我
"Come here,baby. Give me the camera."

282
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,530
希望你还吃得下 因为晚餐快好了
I hope you're not full. Dinner's almost ready.

283
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,620
我回房间去就好了
I think I'll probably just hang out in my room.

284
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,070
为什么？
Why?

285
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,430
拜托你们
Come on,you guys!

286
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,410
要是艾蜜莉知道 我跟你们一起吃饭
If Emily knew I was having dinner with you,

287
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,940
她一定会抓狂，你们也很清楚
she'd flip out.You know it

288
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,870
没关系…我无所谓
It's okay. I really don't mind.

289
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,440
等等…请你留下来
Wait,wait. You know what? Just stay.

290
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,540
拜托
Please.

291
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:15,250
我希望你留下来
It would mean a lot for me if you stay.

292
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:20,920
罗斯… 拜托你，跟我们一起吃饭
Ross,I just -Please,just have dinner with us!

293
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,270
好好好，乔伊，别激动 对不起，抱歉
okay Joey，Settle down.All right. I'm sorry.

294
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,730
瑞秋，因为我是演员…
You see,Rach,I'm an actor.

295
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:37,470
看，那个光屁股的丑八怪 又出现了
Hey,look! Ugly Naked Guy's back.

296
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,740
我好久没看到他了
We haven't seen him in so long.

297
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:44,550
天啊，我真想念这个死胖子
Oh,God! I really missed that fat bastard.

298
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,390
这可真怪
This is so weird.

299
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:53,930
我刚想到这可能是 大家最后一次在一起了
I realized this may be the last time we hang out together.

300
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,300
他似乎也知道
It's almost as if he knew.

301
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,190
我来接
I'll get it.

302
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,560
喂
Hello

303
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:07,330
嗨，艾蜜莉
Hi,Emily.

304
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:12,010
他在这里，你等等
You tracked him down. Hold on.

305
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,440
嘿
Hey

306
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,680
对，我们正在吃饭
Yeah,we're just having dinner.

307
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:23,310
好，你等等，她跟大家打招呼
Sure,hold on.She wants to say hi.

308
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,430
嗨，艾蜜莉 嗨
Hi,Emily!

309
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:30,090
大家好
Hello,everyone.

310
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,320
你们有谁在啊？
So who am I saying hello to?

311
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:38,890
我不知道这里有谁 不过瑞秋肯定不在
Well,I don't know about who's here...but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here,and that's Rachel!

312
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,630
最好是这样
I should hope not. 

313
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,970
罗斯应该很清楚了
Ross knows better than that by now.

314
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,720
你知道吗，其实瑞秋也在
You know what? Rachel is here.

315
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,180
她也在？
She's there?

316
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:55,280
对，她在那边
Oh,yeah,there she is!

317
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,420
她在这里
She's here.

318
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:01,720
罗斯，关掉免提
Take me off speakerphone.

319
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,260
嗨
Hi

320
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,890
你怎么可以这样？
How could you do this to me?

321
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,130
我以为我已经把瑞秋的事 说得够清楚了
I made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear.

322
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,400
艾蜜莉，我只是跟朋友吃饭
I'm just having dinner with my friends,okay?

323
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,240
你就是喜欢跟她粘在一起
-You can't keep away from her. 

324
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,280
你太夸张了
-That's ridiculous.

325
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,940
你是谁？
-Hello? Hello? -Who is this?

326
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,070
我是罗斯，你干嘛？
It's Ross. What are you doing?

327
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,280
抱歉，老兄，我要打电话
Sorry,dude,I had to make a call.

328
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,810
乔伊
Joey.

329
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,560
虽然这里有两支电话 但是只有一条电话线
Joey,they don't have two lines,they have two phones.

330
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,290
这样啊
Gotcha.

331
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,940
对不起，艾蜜莉 我从来没骗过你
I'm sorry. Emily,listen. I have never cheated on you.

332
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,240
我愿意为你搬家
I'm moving for you.

333
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,540
愿意为你不见朋友
 I'm cutting friends out of my life for you.

334
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:56,240
求求你快搭飞机来纽约
Please,get on the plane and come to New York,okay?

335
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:59,620
你就知道我只想跟你在一起
You're the only one I want to be with.

336
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,650
如果我在那边 就不会这么紧张了
I'll feel better when I'm there.

337
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,190
也可以随时知道你在哪里
 I can know where you are all the time.

338
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:11,760
你不可能永远掌握我的行踪
You can't know where I am all the time.

339
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:15,860
如果你不信任我 这个婚姻永远有问题
This marriage will never work if you don't trust me.

340
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:18,700
你说得对
You're right.

341
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:23,770
你能相信我吗？
Can you trust me?

342
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,650
不能
No

343
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,880
好像很顺利
I think it's going okay.

344
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,220
他好像在微笑
Looks like he's smiling.

345
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:41,060
你怎么知道？ 你只看得到他的背影
How can you tell? You can only see his back.

346
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,060
当然看得出来
You can totally tell!

347
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,360
你们看
Here,look,watch me.

348
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:50,140
微笑，皱眉，微笑，皱眉
Smile.Frown. Smile.Frown.

349
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,400
微笑
Smile.

350
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,840
结束了
I guess that's it.

351
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,150
怎么了？ 怎么回事？
Why? What happened?

352
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,460
我的婚姻完了 什么？
My marriage is over.What？

353
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,820
亲爱的
Oh，sweetie

354
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:17,960
看看你，全身发抖
Look at you,you're shivering.

355
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,260
给你
Here.

356
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:25,460
罗斯，需要我们做什么吗？
Honey,is there anything we can do?

357
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:33,950
是的，帮我跟甘瑟要回家具
You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.

358
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,500
别再折磨我了
Stop tormenting me!

359
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,170
这是貂皮，貂很坏
This is mink,okay? They're mean,

360
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,100
而且貂讨厌松鼠
and they hate squirrels.

361
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,670
很多貂都想被做成貂皮
Most of these probably wanted to be coats.

362
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,670
好好好，我知道了
Fine. No,I get it.

363
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,810
拿去
Here.

364
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,640
给你
You take it.

365
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:15,190
高兴了吧？我快冷死了
Are you happy now? I'm cold!
