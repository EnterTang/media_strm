1
00:00:00,712 --> 00:00:05,842
Guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy's
putting stuff in boxes.

2
00:00:07,886 --> 00:00:10,680
I'd say our naked buddy is moving.

3
00:00:10,931 --> 00:00:15,769
Ironically, most of the boxes
seem to be labeled "Clothes".

4
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:18,438
I'm going to miss that big
old squishy butt.

5
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:22,943
And we're done
with the chicken fried rice.

6
00:00:23,193 --> 00:00:27,113
If he's moving, maybe I should
try to get his place!

7
00:00:27,364 --> 00:00:30,033
It would be so cool
to live across from you guys.

8
00:00:30,283 --> 00:00:32,327
We could do that telephone thing...

9
00:00:32,577 --> 00:00:35,163
...where you have a can,
we have a can...

10
00:00:35,413 --> 00:00:38,708
...and it's connected by a string.

11
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:43,046
Or we could do
the actual telephone thing.

12
00:00:43,296 --> 00:00:46,591
The One Where
Everyone Finds Out

13
00:01:30,844 --> 00:01:33,847
Oh, my God. I love this apartment!

14
00:01:34,097 --> 00:01:35,390
Isn't it perfect?

15
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,227
I can't believe I never realized
how great it is!

16
00:01:39,477 --> 00:01:43,231
Because your eye goes
to the big naked man.

17
00:01:43,481 --> 00:01:44,774
It's amazing!

18
00:01:45,025 --> 00:01:49,529
Hurry up with an application,
or I'll beat you to it.

19
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,288
Well, I'm going to use
Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom.

20
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:05,045
Look! There's Monica and Chandler.

21
00:02:05,128 --> 00:02:08,381
Hey, you guys!

22
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,768
Chandler and Monica!

23
00:02:20,018 --> 00:02:22,938
Oh, my God!

24
00:02:24,773 --> 00:02:25,732
Oh, my eyes!

25
00:02:25,982 --> 00:02:28,568
My eyes!

26
00:02:29,027 --> 00:02:30,070
It's okay!

27
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,239
- They're doing it!
- I know!

28
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:34,449
- I know!
- You know?

29
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:38,828
Yes, I know it. Joey knows,
but Ross doesn't, so stop screaming!

30
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:41,706
What's going on?

31
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,626
- What?
- Nothing!

32
00:02:44,876 --> 00:02:48,421
We are so excited
that you'll get this apartment!

33
00:02:48,672 --> 00:02:49,631
Looks really good.

34
00:02:49,881 --> 00:02:52,592
Looks pretty good!

35
00:02:52,843 --> 00:02:55,428
Get in here!
Come on!

36
00:03:01,893 --> 00:03:04,229
You mean whenever
Monica and Chandler...

37
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:07,649
...were doing laundry
or going grocery shopping?

38
00:03:07,899 --> 00:03:10,986
The time Monica spent on the phone
with Linda from camp?

39
00:03:11,236 --> 00:03:14,406
Doing it, doing it, phone, doing it.

40
00:03:14,656 --> 00:03:16,366
I can't believe it!

41
00:03:16,616 --> 00:03:19,035
I think it's great. For him.

42
00:03:19,286 --> 00:03:22,289
She could do better.

43
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:23,874
Hey, you guys.

44
00:03:24,124 --> 00:03:25,458
Come here!

45
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:27,878
Phoebe found out
about Monica and Chandler.

46
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:32,174
You mean how they're friends
and nothing more?

47
00:03:32,966 --> 00:03:34,384
Joey, she knows.

48
00:03:34,634 --> 00:03:38,346
We saw them doing it
through the window.

49
00:03:38,597 --> 00:03:43,435
Actually, we saw them doing it
up against the window.

50
00:03:43,602 --> 00:03:47,022
So they know you know,
and they don't know Rachel knows?

51
00:03:47,272 --> 00:03:50,275
Yes, but it doesn't matter
who knows what.

52
00:03:50,525 --> 00:03:53,695
Now enough of us know
that we could just tell them we know.

53
00:03:53,945 --> 00:03:56,948
All the lying and the secrets
will finally be over.

54
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:02,454
Or, we could not tell them we know,
and have a little fun.

55
00:04:02,996 --> 00:04:04,080
What do you mean?

56
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:09,794
If they say they are doing laundry,
we'll give them laundry to do.

57
00:04:10,086 --> 00:04:12,464
I would enjoy that.

58
00:04:12,714 --> 00:04:16,510
You know what would be even more fun?
Telling them.

59
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,720
No, I want to do Phoebe's thing.

60
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:19,846
I can't take...

61
00:04:20,096 --> 00:04:23,683
You don't have to do anything.
Just don't tell them we know.

62
00:04:23,934 --> 00:04:25,685
I can't take anymore secrets.

63
00:04:25,936 --> 00:04:30,690
I got your secrets, their secrets,
secrets of my own.

64
00:04:30,982 --> 00:04:33,735
You don't have any secrets.

65
00:04:33,985 --> 00:04:39,157
Well, you don't know about Hugsy,
my bedtime penguin pal.

66
00:04:43,995 --> 00:04:46,623
How are we going to mess with them?

67
00:04:46,873 --> 00:04:49,376
You could use your position
as the roommate.

68
00:04:49,626 --> 00:04:53,213
And I would use the strongest tool
at my disposal.

69
00:04:53,463 --> 00:04:55,966
My sexuality.

70
00:04:56,216 --> 00:04:59,010
Hello, children.

71
00:04:59,261 --> 00:05:03,056
Watch. Learn.
And don't eat my cookie.

72
00:05:06,309 --> 00:05:09,312
That jacket looks great on you.

73
00:05:09,563 --> 00:05:11,731
- Really?
- The material is so soft.

74
00:05:11,982 --> 00:05:15,318
Hello, Mr. Bicep.

75
00:05:16,278 --> 00:05:17,404
You're working out?

76
00:05:17,654 --> 00:05:21,199
I try to squeeze things.

77
00:05:26,121 --> 00:05:27,455
Are you okay?

78
00:05:27,706 --> 00:05:29,833
If you really want to know...

79
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,335
I can't tell you this.

80
00:05:32,586 --> 00:05:34,296
You can tell me anything.

81
00:05:34,546 --> 00:05:37,716
Actually, you are the one person
I can't tell this to.

82
00:05:37,966 --> 00:05:42,053
And the one person I want to the most.

83
00:05:43,305 --> 00:05:45,432
What's going on?

84
00:05:45,682 --> 00:05:48,935
I just haven't been
with a guy in so long...

85
00:05:49,186 --> 00:05:51,730
...and sometimes you're
looking for something...

86
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:55,650
...and it's right there
in front of you, sipping coffee...

87
00:05:55,901 --> 00:05:59,696
Oh, no. Have I said too much?

88
00:06:00,697 --> 00:06:05,410
Just something to think about.
I know I will.

89
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,132
You are so cute.

90
00:06:19,382 --> 00:06:21,718
How did you get to be so cute?

91
00:06:21,968 --> 00:06:24,179
My grandfather was Swedish.

92
00:06:24,429 --> 00:06:28,600
And my grandmother was
a tiny little bunny.

93
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:31,978
Now you're even cuter.

94
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:36,483
You know, that is a popular
opinion today, I must say.

95
00:06:36,733 --> 00:06:39,319
The weirdest thing happened
at the coffeehouse.

96
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:42,197
Phoebe was hitting on me.

97
00:06:42,447 --> 00:06:44,115
What are you talking about?

98
00:06:44,366 --> 00:06:47,911
I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.

99
00:06:50,247 --> 00:06:52,707
It's not possible.

100
00:06:55,585 --> 00:06:59,005
I'm sorry, Phoebe's just
always thought you were charming...

101
00:06:59,256 --> 00:07:01,341
...in a sexless kind of way.

102
00:07:01,591 --> 00:07:05,554
You know, I can't hear that enough.

103
00:07:05,804 --> 00:07:08,014
I just think you misunderstood her.

104
00:07:08,265 --> 00:07:10,851
I didn't, okay?
She was all over me.

105
00:07:11,101 --> 00:07:13,895
She touched my bicep,
for crying out loud.

106
00:07:14,145 --> 00:07:15,355
This bicep?

107
00:07:15,605 --> 00:07:19,776
Well, it's not flexed right now.

108
00:07:24,447 --> 00:07:27,951
Mon, you want to come
see a movie with us?

109
00:07:28,201 --> 00:07:32,539
Actually, I was going
to do some laundry.

110
00:07:33,748 --> 00:07:35,083
Want to do it with me?

111
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:38,378
Sure, I'll do it with you.

112
00:07:38,628 --> 00:07:42,507
Okay, great.
Hold on a second.

113
00:07:43,758 --> 00:07:46,011
Here you go.

114
00:07:46,261 --> 00:07:50,390
That would really help me out a lot.
Thanks.

115
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,101
You know what?
I don't have enough quarters.

116
00:07:53,351 --> 00:07:56,730
I have quarters!

117
00:07:59,566 --> 00:08:01,776
Hey, any word on the apartment yet?

118
00:08:02,027 --> 00:08:05,614
I called there, and it turns out
Naked Guy is subletting it.

119
00:08:05,864 --> 00:08:08,283
He's already had 100 applicants.

120
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:09,910
No, I've got the edge.

121
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,913
It's not exactly ethical,
but I sent him a bribe...

122
00:08:13,163 --> 00:08:15,624
...to tip the scales in my direction.

123
00:08:15,874 --> 00:08:19,002
You can see it from the window.

124
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:25,467
Is it that pinball machine
with the big bow on it?

125
00:08:25,884 --> 00:08:29,221
That new mountain bike?

126
00:08:30,847 --> 00:08:32,098
What did you send?

127
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:36,019
A basket of mini muffins.

128
00:08:36,269 --> 00:08:40,565
There's a whole table of them.
Which one did you send?

129
00:08:40,815 --> 00:08:43,360
The small one.

130
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:48,490
You actually thought that basket
was going to get you the apartment?

131
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:53,411
Someone sent us a basket at work, and
people went crazy over those muffins.

132
00:08:53,662 --> 00:08:55,288
It was the best day.

133
00:08:55,539 --> 00:08:59,000
Your work makes me sad.

134
00:08:59,251 --> 00:09:02,254
Oh, man, I want that place so much!

135
00:09:02,504 --> 00:09:05,215
And I was so sure
that was going to work.

136
00:09:05,465 --> 00:09:09,177
There's 12 bucks
I'll never see again.

137
00:09:09,427 --> 00:09:12,430
We'd better go if we want
to catch that movie.

138
00:09:12,681 --> 00:09:14,266
Bye.

139
00:09:14,516 --> 00:09:18,854
Bye, Chandler.
I miss you already.

140
00:09:22,524 --> 00:09:25,402
Did you see that? The inappropriate,
and the pinching?

141
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:26,736
Actually, I did.

142
00:09:26,987 --> 00:09:31,032
So do you believe
that she's attracted to me?

143
00:09:31,533 --> 00:09:34,494
Oh, my God!
She knows about us!

144
00:09:34,744 --> 00:09:35,662
Are you serious?

145
00:09:35,912 --> 00:09:38,623
She knows, and she's trying
to freak us out!

146
00:09:38,874 --> 00:09:42,419
That's the only explanation!

147
00:09:44,254 --> 00:09:48,842
But what about my pinchable butt
and my bulging biceps?

148
00:09:49,092 --> 00:09:51,761
She knows!

149
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,689
Phoebe knows about us.

150
00:10:02,939 --> 00:10:04,232
I didn't tell them!

151
00:10:04,482 --> 00:10:05,525
Them?

152
00:10:05,775 --> 00:10:08,195
Who's "them"?

153
00:10:08,445 --> 00:10:12,407
Phoebe and Joey.

154
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:15,911
And Rachel.

155
00:10:16,161 --> 00:10:19,372
I would have told you,
but I promised not to tell.

156
00:10:19,623 --> 00:10:20,457
I'm sorry.

157
00:10:20,707 --> 00:10:22,417
But it's over now, right?

158
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:28,632
You can tell them you know they know,
and I can go back to knowing nothing!

159
00:10:28,715 --> 00:10:30,091
Unless...

160
00:10:30,342 --> 00:10:32,844
Not "unless"!
This must end now!

161
00:10:33,094 --> 00:10:36,598
They think they are so slick
messing with us.

162
00:10:36,848 --> 00:10:41,520
But they don't know
that we know that they know.

163
00:10:41,561 --> 00:10:42,354
So...

164
00:10:42,604 --> 00:10:47,984
The messers become the messees!

165
00:10:50,237 --> 00:10:52,739
Honey, you got to stop
torturing yourself.

166
00:10:52,989 --> 00:10:54,991
Why don't you find another apartment?

167
00:10:55,242 --> 00:10:58,078
I've already looked
at 1000 apartments this month.

168
00:10:58,328 --> 00:11:00,997
None of them even compares
to that one.

169
00:11:01,248 --> 00:11:02,457
You know what?

170
00:11:02,707 --> 00:11:06,837
You should find out his hobbies
and use that to bond with him.

171
00:11:07,087 --> 00:11:09,005
Like if I wanted something from Joey...

172
00:11:09,256 --> 00:11:14,970
...I would strike up a conversation
about sandwiches...

173
00:11:15,804 --> 00:11:18,265
...or my underwear.

174
00:11:18,515 --> 00:11:21,434
I'm listening.

175
00:11:22,978 --> 00:11:25,313
That is a great idea!

176
00:11:25,564 --> 00:11:30,110
And I know Ugly Naked Guy because
we've been watching him for five years.

177
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,738
So that gives me back my edge!

178
00:11:33,989 --> 00:11:36,741
Let's see now.
He had the trampoline.

179
00:11:36,992 --> 00:11:37,909
He broke that.

180
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:41,955
- He had gravity boots.
- He broke those too.

181
00:11:42,205 --> 00:11:46,710
So he likes to break stuff.

182
00:11:47,627 --> 00:11:51,631
I've got to go pick up Ben.
But I will figure something out.

183
00:11:51,882 --> 00:11:53,633
Didn't he used to have a cat?

184
00:11:53,884 --> 00:11:56,595
I wouldn't bring that up.
It would bum him out.

185
00:11:56,845 --> 00:12:01,224
Poor cat never saw
that big butt coming.

186
00:12:05,604 --> 00:12:07,898
Hold on a second,
she's right here.

187
00:12:08,148 --> 00:12:10,525
It's Chandler.

188
00:12:12,652 --> 00:12:14,613
Hello, you.

189
00:12:14,863 --> 00:12:19,242
Phoebe, I've been thinking
about you all day.

190
00:12:20,869 --> 00:12:24,831
You know that thing you said before?
I was intrigued.

191
00:12:25,081 --> 00:12:26,208
Really?

192
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,043
Joey won't be here tonight.

193
00:12:28,293 --> 00:12:32,130
Why don't you come over?
I'll let you feel my bicep.

194
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,926
Or maybe more.

195
00:12:36,927 --> 00:12:40,722
I'll have to get back to you on that.

196
00:12:41,473 --> 00:12:45,685
He wants me to come over
and feel his bicep and more!

197
00:12:45,936 --> 00:12:47,062
Are you kidding?

198
00:12:47,312 --> 00:12:51,358
I cannot believe
he would do that to Mon...

199
00:12:58,615 --> 00:13:02,911
Joey? Do they know that we know?

200
00:13:04,246 --> 00:13:05,038
They know you know.

201
00:13:05,288 --> 00:13:07,707
I knew it!

202
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,001
I cannot believe those two!

203
00:13:10,252 --> 00:13:15,549
They thought they could mess with us?
Trying to mess with us?

204
00:13:16,341 --> 00:13:20,971
They don't know that we know
they know we know.

205
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:23,139
Joey, you can't say anything.

206
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:26,726
Couldn't if I wanted to.

207
00:13:32,148 --> 00:13:36,987
Good evening, sir. I'm Ross Geller.
I'm one of the applicants.

208
00:13:37,237 --> 00:13:42,826
I realize that the competition
is fierce but...

209
00:13:42,951 --> 00:13:49,124
I'm sorry, I can't help but notice
that you're naked.

210
00:13:51,376 --> 00:13:53,003
I applaud you.

211
00:13:53,253 --> 00:13:56,131
Man, I wish I was naked.

212
00:13:56,381 --> 00:13:59,926
I mean, this looks so great.

213
00:14:00,177 --> 00:14:04,347
That is how God intended it.

214
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,892
Look. They're panicked!

215
00:14:07,142 --> 00:14:10,103
They'll totally back down.

216
00:14:10,395 --> 00:14:13,273
If he wants a date,
he's going to get a date.

217
00:14:13,523 --> 00:14:15,108
I'm going to go in.

218
00:14:15,358 --> 00:14:18,320
Be sexy.

219
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,947
Please.

220
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:34,669
I'd love to come by tonight.

221
00:14:37,214 --> 00:14:38,006
Really?

222
00:14:38,256 --> 00:14:41,927
Absolutely.
Say, around seven?

223
00:14:44,804 --> 00:14:50,352
I'm really looking forward to you
and me having sexual intercourse.

224
00:14:54,898 --> 00:14:56,316
Hey, check it out!

225
00:14:56,566 --> 00:14:59,903
Naked Guy's got a naked friend.

226
00:15:07,452 --> 00:15:11,373
Oh, my God!
That's our friend!

227
00:15:11,623 --> 00:15:15,252
It's Naked Ross!

228
00:15:19,214 --> 00:15:21,132
Showtime!

229
00:15:21,383 --> 00:15:22,926
Rachel, get me perfume.

230
00:15:23,176 --> 00:15:27,597
Joey, can you get me
a bottle of wine and glasses?

231
00:15:33,186 --> 00:15:38,984
Make her think you want to have
sex with her and it will freak her out.

232
00:15:39,234 --> 00:15:41,528
How far would I have to go with her?

233
00:15:41,778 --> 00:15:43,738
She'll give in way before you do.

234
00:15:43,989 --> 00:15:44,865
How do you know?

235
00:15:45,115 --> 00:15:49,536
Because you're on my team.
My team always wins.

236
00:15:49,786 --> 00:15:52,038
At this?

237
00:15:52,289 --> 00:15:56,376
Just go get some! Go!

238
00:15:56,835 --> 00:15:59,546
Now, I'm going to try to listen
from right here.

239
00:15:59,796 --> 00:16:01,464
Oh, wait.

240
00:16:01,715 --> 00:16:02,966
Good idea.

241
00:16:03,216 --> 00:16:06,970
Don't give away the farm.

242
00:16:15,478 --> 00:16:17,772
Come on in.

243
00:16:18,023 --> 00:16:20,650
I was going to.

244
00:16:22,152 --> 00:16:24,404
I brought some wine.
Would you like some?

245
00:16:24,654 --> 00:16:27,449
Sure.

246
00:16:33,997 --> 00:16:35,457
So here we are.

247
00:16:35,707 --> 00:16:36,750
Nervous?

248
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,044
Me? No. You?

249
00:16:39,294 --> 00:16:42,214
I want this to happen.

250
00:16:42,923 --> 00:16:45,509
So do I.

251
00:16:57,979 --> 00:17:00,023
I'm going to put on some music.

252
00:17:00,273 --> 00:17:04,528
Maybe I'll dance for you.

253
00:17:22,254 --> 00:17:25,423
You look good.

254
00:17:25,465 --> 00:17:27,217
Thanks.

255
00:17:27,467 --> 00:17:31,346
You know, when you say
things like that, it makes me...

256
00:17:31,596 --> 00:17:36,893
...want to rip that
sweater vest right off.

257
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:39,187
Why don't we move into the bedroom?

258
00:17:39,437 --> 00:17:40,272
Really?

259
00:17:40,522 --> 00:17:44,067
Do you not want to?

260
00:17:44,276 --> 00:17:47,362
First I want to take off
all my clothes...

261
00:17:47,612 --> 00:17:51,616
...and have you rub lotion on me.

262
00:17:51,867 --> 00:17:55,203
That would be nice.

263
00:17:56,538 --> 00:18:00,000
I'll go get the lotion.

264
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,505
It's way out of hand.
She wants me to put lotion on her!

265
00:18:05,755 --> 00:18:08,425
- She's bluffing!
- She's not backing down.

266
00:18:08,675 --> 00:18:11,887
She went like this...

267
00:18:12,637 --> 00:18:17,017
He's not backing down.
He went to get lotion.

268
00:18:18,351 --> 00:18:20,353
Aren't you guys done yet?

269
00:18:20,604 --> 00:18:23,440
I want to sit in my chair!

270
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:28,737
The sooner Phoebe breaks him, the sooner
it's over and out in the open.

271
00:18:28,987 --> 00:18:31,406
I like that.

272
00:18:31,656 --> 00:18:36,995
Show him your bra.
He's afraid of bras. Can't work them.

273
00:18:42,876 --> 00:18:45,378
You didn't rip off any buttons.

274
00:18:45,629 --> 00:18:48,715
It's not my first time.

275
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:52,427
Go back there and seduce her
till she cracks!

276
00:18:52,677 --> 00:18:54,721
Give me a second.

277
00:18:54,971 --> 00:18:59,434
- Did you clean up in here?
- Of course!

278
00:19:03,813 --> 00:19:05,232
You're going?

279
00:19:05,482 --> 00:19:09,027
Not without you, lover.

280
00:19:12,572 --> 00:19:17,285
So, this is my bra.

281
00:19:19,371 --> 00:19:23,250
It's very, very nice.

282
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:26,086
Well, come here.

283
00:19:26,336 --> 00:19:30,590
I'm very happy we're going
to have all the sex.

284
00:19:30,715 --> 00:19:35,637
You should be.
I'm very bendy.

285
00:19:38,849 --> 00:19:40,141
I'll kiss you now.

286
00:19:40,392 --> 00:19:43,770
Not if I kiss you first.

287
00:20:02,497 --> 00:20:06,042
I guess there's nothing
left for us to do but kiss.

288
00:20:06,293 --> 00:20:08,962
Here it comes.

289
00:20:09,212 --> 00:20:12,299
Our first kiss.

290
00:20:21,183 --> 00:20:23,185
You win!

291
00:20:23,435 --> 00:20:24,269
I can't have sex with you!

292
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:26,563
- And why not?
- I'm in love with Monica!

293
00:20:26,813 --> 00:20:29,733
You're what?

294
00:20:30,692 --> 00:20:31,651
Love her!

295
00:20:31,902 --> 00:20:33,111
I love her!

296
00:20:33,361 --> 00:20:37,449
I love her!

297
00:20:40,327 --> 00:20:42,829
I love you, Monica.

298
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:46,625
I love you too, Chandler.

299
00:20:50,754 --> 00:20:55,675
I thought you were doing it.
I didn't know you were in love!

300
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,930
Dude!

301
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:04,226
Hats off to Phoebe.
Quite a competitor.

302
00:21:04,643 --> 00:21:06,895
May I say your breasts
are still showing?

303
00:21:07,145 --> 00:21:09,314
God.

304
00:21:09,564 --> 00:21:11,107
All right!
So that's it?

305
00:21:11,358 --> 00:21:13,068
It's over.
Everybody knows!

306
00:21:13,318 --> 00:21:14,819
Actually, Ross doesn't.

307
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:19,074
We'd appreciate it
if no one told him yet.

308
00:21:25,413 --> 00:21:27,457
A new place for a new Ross.

309
00:21:27,707 --> 00:21:31,461
I'll have you and the guys from work
over, once it's furnished.

310
00:21:31,711 --> 00:21:33,839
It's nice to see you
back on your feet.

311
00:21:34,089 --> 00:21:38,051
I am that, and the whole rage thing
is definitely behind me.

312
00:21:38,301 --> 00:21:41,388
I wonder if it's time for you
to rejoin our museum team?

313
00:21:41,638 --> 00:21:43,014
That would be great.

314
00:21:43,265 --> 00:21:48,144
I am totally ready
to come back to work.

315
00:21:52,649 --> 00:21:55,485
What are you doing?

316
00:21:55,735 --> 00:22:00,240
Get off my sister!
