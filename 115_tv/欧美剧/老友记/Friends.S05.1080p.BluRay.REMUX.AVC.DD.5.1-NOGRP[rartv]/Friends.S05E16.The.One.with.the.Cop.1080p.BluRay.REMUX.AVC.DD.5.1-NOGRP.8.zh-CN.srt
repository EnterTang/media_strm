1
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:11,598
- What are you guys doing up?
- Finishing the crossword.

2
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:15,477
Do you know a six-letter
word for "red"?

3
00:00:15,728 --> 00:00:18,439
Dark-red.

4
00:00:18,647 --> 00:00:23,777
Wrong, but there's a connect-the-dots
in here for you later.

5
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:26,905
Hey, how about maroon?

6
00:00:27,156 --> 00:00:30,951
Yes! You are so smart!

7
00:00:31,368 --> 00:00:32,745
You guys are so cute.

8
00:00:32,995 --> 00:00:35,039
I know.

9
00:00:35,289 --> 00:00:38,459
See you in the morning.

10
00:00:51,055 --> 00:00:53,807
I love doing crossword
puzzles with you.

11
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:54,892
Me too.

12
00:00:55,142 --> 00:00:57,728
Now let's finish this
and go to bed.

13
00:00:57,978 --> 00:00:59,313
Only one left.

14
00:00:59,563 --> 00:01:03,984
Three-letter word.
Not dog, but...

15
00:01:04,234 --> 00:01:06,987
Cat.

16
00:01:08,655 --> 00:01:11,867
You are so smart!

17
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:13,911
I love you.

18
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:17,122
I love you too.

19
00:01:29,885 --> 00:01:33,138
The One with a Cop

20
00:02:21,562 --> 00:02:22,896
We still need a tip.

21
00:02:23,147 --> 00:02:25,607
All right. Hold on.

22
00:02:25,858 --> 00:02:27,818
I got it.

23
00:02:28,068 --> 00:02:29,903
Nickel.

24
00:02:30,154 --> 00:02:33,073
- How much do we need?
- Couple of bucks.

25
00:02:33,323 --> 00:02:35,409
Okay, dime.

26
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:38,662
You guys keep talking.
This could take a while.

27
00:02:38,912 --> 00:02:41,623
Wait, look it!

28
00:02:41,874 --> 00:02:43,751
This is a police badge!

29
00:02:44,001 --> 00:02:49,631
Cool. But why would a cop come
in here? They don't serve doughnuts.

30
00:02:50,257 --> 00:02:55,179
Can you discover the badge again?
I can do better than that.

31
00:02:55,429 --> 00:02:57,473
I bet somebody's
missing that badge.

32
00:02:57,723 --> 00:03:00,934
I should take it back.
But at the police station...

33
00:03:01,185 --> 00:03:03,103
...I'll check their
Ten Most Wanted.

34
00:03:03,354 --> 00:03:08,650
My friend's been Number 11 forever.
This could be her year!

35
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,614
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey, Joey.

36
00:03:14,448 --> 00:03:16,825
Is that my sweatshirt?

37
00:03:17,076 --> 00:03:20,454
Yes, it is. I'm sorry.
I was cold. I hope it's okay.

38
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:24,208
It's just that if you wear
someone's sweatshirt...

39
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,710
...shouldn't it be your boyfriend's?

40
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,880
And I'm not him.

41
00:03:30,089 --> 00:03:32,549
I'm sorry.
I'll give it back.

42
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,011
It's going to be all
smelling like Monica.

43
00:03:36,261 --> 00:03:38,347
Do I smell bad?

44
00:03:38,597 --> 00:03:42,643
You smell like a meadow.

45
00:03:43,602 --> 00:03:45,979
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:47,731 --> 00:03:48,774
What's with him?

47
00:03:49,024 --> 00:03:54,905
The last time Joey went to a meadow,
his mother was shot by a hunter.

48
00:04:10,671 --> 00:04:12,881
I still don't know.

49
00:04:13,132 --> 00:04:17,052
I want to make sure I bought
the right couch, one that says...

50
00:04:17,302 --> 00:04:21,557
..."Kids welcome here",
but that also says...

51
00:04:21,807 --> 00:04:24,852
..."Come here to me."

52
00:04:26,311 --> 00:04:30,691
What? You say that to kids?

53
00:04:31,358 --> 00:04:36,530
The "Come here to me" is,
you know, for the ladies.

54
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,410
Honey, it's a nice couch,
not a magic couch.

55
00:04:41,952 --> 00:04:44,288
Well, you picked a great couch.

56
00:04:44,538 --> 00:04:46,999
- Sign here please.
- Sure.

57
00:04:47,249 --> 00:04:51,253
The delivery charge
is almost as much as the couch!

58
00:04:51,503 --> 00:04:54,465
That's ridiculous.
He lives three blocks away.

59
00:04:54,715 --> 00:04:58,052
I'll take it myself.
Thank you.

60
00:04:58,302 --> 00:05:02,473
All right, Rach, come on.
Let's go.

61
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,021
Are you kidding?

62
00:05:09,271 --> 00:05:14,943
Come on. It's only three blocks.
It's not very heavy. Try it.

63
00:05:18,739 --> 00:05:20,783
Oh, I can do it.

64
00:05:21,033 --> 00:05:24,119
You two will really
enjoy that couch.

65
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,665
We're not together.

66
00:05:27,915 --> 00:05:32,127
Something didn't quite add up there.

67
00:05:37,549 --> 00:05:40,010
What's that supposed to mean?

68
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,596
Well, you. Her.

69
00:05:42,846 --> 00:05:44,640
I mean, she's very...

70
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,100
...you know.

71
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,102
And you're, like...

72
00:05:48,352 --> 00:05:50,854
...you know?

73
00:05:52,523 --> 00:05:56,318
Not that it's any of your business,
but we did go out.

74
00:05:56,568 --> 00:05:58,987
Really? You two?

75
00:05:59,238 --> 00:06:02,700
I don't want to do this now.
I'm carrying a heavy couch.

76
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,577
Then tell him quickly.

77
00:06:05,828 --> 00:06:07,663
Fine. We went out.

78
00:06:07,913 --> 00:06:10,207
Not only did we go out...

79
00:06:10,457 --> 00:06:14,795
...we did it 298 times!

80
00:06:17,506 --> 00:06:22,094
You kept count?
You are such a loser!

81
00:06:22,344 --> 00:06:27,808
A loser you did it with 298 times!

82
00:06:32,771 --> 00:06:37,026
Excuse me, ma'am. You can't put
your cigarette out on a tree.

83
00:06:37,276 --> 00:06:39,570
Yeah, I can.
It worked well.

84
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,865
But you shouldn't.
So don't ever do that again.

85
00:06:43,115 --> 00:06:46,035
I won't till I have
my next cigarette.

86
00:06:46,285 --> 00:06:47,494
Hold it!

87
00:06:47,745 --> 00:06:51,206
NYPD. Freeze, punk!

88
00:06:51,665 --> 00:06:55,127
That's right. You are so busted.

89
00:06:55,377 --> 00:06:58,005
Book them.

90
00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:01,383
- Who are you talking to?
- Save it, red!

91
00:07:01,633 --> 00:07:05,888
Apologize to the tree or
spend the night in the slammer.

92
00:07:06,138 --> 00:07:08,932
I am not apologizing to a tree.

93
00:07:09,183 --> 00:07:14,313
Apologize to the tree now,
or I am calling for backup.

94
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,482
Backup! Backup!

95
00:07:16,732 --> 00:07:18,317
I'm sorry! Sorry!

96
00:07:18,567 --> 00:07:23,197
Okay, cancel backup!
Cancel backup!

97
00:07:24,573 --> 00:07:27,701
Didn't you say there was
an elevator in here?

98
00:07:27,951 --> 00:07:32,247
Yes, I did, but there isn't.
Here we go!

99
00:07:32,665 --> 00:07:34,416
Okay, go left.

100
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:36,335
Left. Left.

101
00:07:36,585 --> 00:07:40,631
Okay, you know what?
There's no more left left.

102
00:07:40,881 --> 00:07:43,217
Lift it straight up over your head.

103
00:07:43,467 --> 00:07:45,636
Straight up. You can do it!

104
00:07:45,886 --> 00:07:47,179
You can do it!

105
00:07:47,429 --> 00:07:48,972
Okay. You got it?

106
00:07:49,223 --> 00:07:50,766
- Go, go.
- Good, good.

107
00:07:51,016 --> 00:07:55,604
You got it, right?
You got it, right? You got...

108
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:03,278
Any chance you think
it looks good there?

109
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:05,698
This guy was all...

110
00:08:05,948 --> 00:08:09,660
And I'm all,
"Buffay! Homicide!"

111
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,912
It was just so cool!

112
00:08:12,162 --> 00:08:17,167
- You were supposed to take it back.
- I'm having fun doing good deeds.

113
00:08:17,418 --> 00:08:21,088
You can get arrested
for impersonating a police officer.

114
00:08:21,338 --> 00:08:25,009
You could get arrested
right now!

115
00:08:26,427 --> 00:08:31,515
I'd better take it back.
I'm totally drunk with power.

116
00:08:40,524 --> 00:08:43,485
Yeah. I didn't know
you guys would be here.

117
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:47,322
- Do me a favor. Taste this.
- What? Why?

118
00:08:47,573 --> 00:08:49,199
- What is with you?
- Nothing.

119
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,410
You're acting strange.

120
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,247
All right. There is something.

121
00:08:55,497 --> 00:08:58,500
I kind of had a dream.

122
00:08:58,751 --> 00:09:01,003
But I don't want to talk about it.

123
00:09:01,253 --> 00:09:05,632
What if Martin Luther King
had said that?

124
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:09,136
I kind of have a dream.

125
00:09:09,386 --> 00:09:13,015
I don't want to talk about it.

126
00:09:13,265 --> 00:09:15,517
Look, it involved Monica.

127
00:09:15,768 --> 00:09:18,562
You dreamt about the girl I'm seeing?
Cool.

128
00:09:18,812 --> 00:09:21,023
I dreamt about the girls he was seeing.

129
00:09:21,273 --> 00:09:25,069
Let's talk about your dream.
I love you. Your dream?

130
00:09:25,319 --> 00:09:28,489
There was no sex.
I haven't dreamt of her like that...

131
00:09:28,739 --> 00:09:32,910
...since I found out
about you two-ish.

132
00:09:36,205 --> 00:09:39,833
What was the dream about?

133
00:09:40,542 --> 00:09:44,171
You were my girlfriend.
We were doing the crossword puzzle.

134
00:09:44,421 --> 00:09:46,215
Like you did last night.

135
00:09:46,465 --> 00:09:49,635
That's it. I'm in love
with Monica. I'll move out.

136
00:09:49,885 --> 00:09:54,098
Joey, come on. That doesn't mean
you're in love with me.

137
00:09:54,348 --> 00:09:55,307
It doesn't?

138
00:09:55,557 --> 00:09:57,267
It could mean anything.
Like...

139
00:09:57,518 --> 00:10:01,647
...you're jealous that I've become
the apartment stud.

140
00:10:01,897 --> 00:10:05,150
Sounds like your dream.

141
00:10:06,318 --> 00:10:11,281
Or it could mean you saw Chandler
and me being close and stuff...

142
00:10:11,532 --> 00:10:13,450
...and you want that too.

143
00:10:13,701 --> 00:10:16,495
In the dream
I did enjoy the closeness.

144
00:10:16,745 --> 00:10:18,789
Are you attracted to Monica?

145
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:24,253
Right here, right now,
are you attracted to her?

146
00:10:24,962 --> 00:10:27,006
- Not really.
- There you have it!

147
00:10:27,256 --> 00:10:31,885
Well, sure!
I'm just wearing sweats!

148
00:10:32,136 --> 00:10:33,220
But that's good!

149
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,557
You're not in love with me.
You just want a girlfriend.

150
00:10:36,807 --> 00:10:39,393
It's not just about
getting a girlfriend.

151
00:10:39,643 --> 00:10:44,189
I could get a girlfriend.
We could sit and do crossword puzzles.

152
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,568
But could we have
the closeness like you have?

153
00:10:47,818 --> 00:10:51,780
Monica and I were friends
before we dated. Maybe that's it.

154
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,949
Friends first?

155
00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:56,660
That's interesting.

156
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:01,665
- You become friends after?
- No, never done that either.

157
00:11:01,915 --> 00:11:04,084
Do you guys have the tape measure?

158
00:11:04,335 --> 00:11:07,921
Yeah. It's actually in my bedroom.

159
00:11:08,172 --> 00:11:11,091
That's right.

160
00:11:22,561 --> 00:11:25,606
What's up, Joey?

161
00:11:26,815 --> 00:11:29,985
How you doing?

162
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,621
Excuse me. Is this your car?

163
00:11:40,871 --> 00:11:44,041
Don't park here.
You're blocking the entrance.

164
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,168
Don't worry.
It's not a problem.

165
00:11:46,418 --> 00:11:52,883
It's a problem for me, so it's a
problem for you because I'm a cop.

166
00:11:53,676 --> 00:11:56,595
So am I.

167
00:12:01,225 --> 00:12:04,311
Okay. So you're a cop.
You can park anywhere.

168
00:12:04,561 --> 00:12:06,563
I know because I'm a cop too.

169
00:12:06,814 --> 00:12:09,191
Keep up the good work.
Ten four.

170
00:12:09,441 --> 00:12:12,444
Wait. So what precinct
are you with?

171
00:12:12,695 --> 00:12:14,947
I'm with the 57th.

172
00:12:15,197 --> 00:12:18,492
- I know a guy in Homicide up there.
- I'm in Vice.

173
00:12:18,742 --> 00:12:23,747
In fact, I'm undercover
right now. I'm a whore.

174
00:12:24,581 --> 00:12:26,750
Who else is in Vice there?

175
00:12:27,001 --> 00:12:28,293
Do you know...

176
00:12:28,544 --> 00:12:30,379
...Sipowitz?

177
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:32,589
Sipowitz? I don't think so.

178
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,135
Yeah. Sipowitz. Yeah.
Big guy, kind of bald.

179
00:12:36,385 --> 00:12:39,221
I don't know him.

180
00:12:39,471 --> 00:12:42,766
Don't try to call him.
He's not there. He's out.

181
00:12:43,017 --> 00:12:46,520
His partner just died.

182
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:49,481
Tell Sipowitz I'm real sorry
for his loss.

183
00:12:49,732 --> 00:12:52,192
I sure will. Take care.

184
00:12:52,443 --> 00:12:55,070
By the way, Sipowitz
will be all right.

185
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,742
That kid from "Silver Spoons"
is really good.

186
00:13:01,285 --> 00:13:04,538
Where'd you find my badge?

187
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:16,967
Could you give me and Ross
a hand moving his couch?

188
00:13:17,217 --> 00:13:20,721
I'd love to but I got acting class.
But you know what?

189
00:13:20,971 --> 00:13:25,684
I guess I could blow that off...
...or you.

190
00:13:29,438 --> 00:13:33,692
Let me ask you something.
I was talking with Monica and Chandler.

191
00:13:33,942 --> 00:13:35,861
Boy, they are really tight.

192
00:13:36,111 --> 00:13:37,071
I know.

193
00:13:37,321 --> 00:13:41,742
That's not a bad situation
they got there.

194
00:13:41,742 --> 00:13:45,204
Think I'll get me one of those.

195
00:13:46,914 --> 00:13:48,791
What's up, Joe?

196
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:52,211
I think Monica and Chandler
are so great...

197
00:13:52,461 --> 00:13:55,047
...because they were friends first.

198
00:13:55,297 --> 00:13:59,593
So I asked myself, who are my friends?
You and Phoebe.

199
00:13:59,843 --> 00:14:03,681
I saw you first, so...

200
00:14:05,265 --> 00:14:11,271
- What are you saying?
- Maybe you and I crank it up a notch.

201
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:15,234
You know, honey...

202
00:14:15,484 --> 00:14:17,778
...as flattered as I am...

203
00:14:18,028 --> 00:14:21,198
...that you saw me first...

204
00:14:21,448 --> 00:14:26,412
...I just don't think we should be
cranking anything up.

205
00:14:26,662 --> 00:14:30,541
I'll treat you real nice.

206
00:14:35,337 --> 00:14:38,716
Yeah. Well, you know...

207
00:14:39,008 --> 00:14:44,013
I think it's a great idea to become
friends with someone before you date.

208
00:14:44,263 --> 00:14:48,350
But the way you do it is you
meet someone, become their friend...

209
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,062
...build a foundation,
then ask them out on a date.

210
00:14:52,312 --> 00:14:56,316
Don't hit on your existing friends.

211
00:14:56,567 --> 00:15:00,571
Won't that take longer?

212
00:15:01,697 --> 00:15:03,615
Oh, but once you find it...

213
00:15:03,866 --> 00:15:07,494
...it's so worth the wait.

214
00:15:08,162 --> 00:15:09,330
I understand.

215
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,332
Good.

216
00:15:11,582 --> 00:15:15,711
Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first.

217
00:15:17,796 --> 00:15:20,466
Come here to me.

218
00:15:20,924 --> 00:15:24,762
No, no. You come here to me.

219
00:15:26,096 --> 00:15:29,808
- I brought reinforcements.
- Great! You brought Joey?

220
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:32,978
The next best thing.

221
00:15:33,854 --> 00:15:38,609
You brought Chandler?
The next best thing would be Monica!

222
00:15:38,859 --> 00:15:43,197
I would be offended, but Monica
is freakishly strong, so...

223
00:15:43,447 --> 00:15:45,866
I drew a sketch
of how we'll do it.

224
00:15:46,116 --> 00:15:47,993
Rach, that's you.

225
00:15:48,243 --> 00:15:50,871
That's the couch.

226
00:15:51,121 --> 00:15:52,539
What's that?

227
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,793
That's me.

228
00:15:58,629 --> 00:16:02,466
Certainly think a lot of yourself.

229
00:16:02,675 --> 00:16:06,095
No. That's my arm.

230
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:14,603
I see. I thought you just really,
really liked your new couch.

231
00:16:16,146 --> 00:16:19,400
Just follow my lead.

232
00:16:20,442 --> 00:16:23,487
Come on, Chandler.

233
00:16:23,737 --> 00:16:25,072
- All right.
- Okay.

234
00:16:25,322 --> 00:16:27,491
Here we go.

235
00:16:27,741 --> 00:16:30,160
All right. Ready?

236
00:16:30,411 --> 00:16:31,453
Turn!

237
00:16:31,704 --> 00:16:32,705
Turn!

238
00:16:32,955 --> 00:16:34,957
Turn!

239
00:16:35,207 --> 00:16:39,294
- I don't think we can turn anymore!
- I don't think it'll fit!

240
00:16:39,545 --> 00:16:42,589
Yeah, it will.
Come on! Up, up, up!

241
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,009
Up! Yes!

242
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:47,720
Here we go! Pivot!

243
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,597
Pivot!

244
00:16:50,806 --> 00:16:52,599
Pivot!

245
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:55,394
Pivot!

246
00:16:55,686 --> 00:16:58,022
Pivot!

247
00:16:58,272 --> 00:16:59,064
Pivot!

248
00:16:59,314 --> 00:17:03,610
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

249
00:17:06,405 --> 00:17:08,824
I don't think it'll pivot anymore.

250
00:17:09,074 --> 00:17:11,994
You think?

251
00:17:12,786 --> 00:17:18,083
All right, let's bring it
back down and try again.

252
00:17:24,631 --> 00:17:28,677
I think it's really stuck now.

253
00:17:28,761 --> 00:17:32,306
- I can't believe that didn't work.
- I know. Me neither.

254
00:17:32,556 --> 00:17:35,726
I mean, you had a sketch.

255
00:17:36,268 --> 00:17:40,272
What did you mean when
you said "pivot"?

256
00:17:44,902 --> 00:17:47,446
How's it going?
Make any new friends?

257
00:17:47,696 --> 00:17:51,283
Yeah.
I met this woman.

258
00:17:52,326 --> 00:17:53,911
What's she like?

259
00:17:54,161 --> 00:17:55,704
Well, she's...

260
00:17:55,954 --> 00:17:58,832
...really good in bed.

261
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:03,337
- You were going to be friends first.
- Hey, it's all your fault.

262
00:18:03,587 --> 00:18:04,380
Why?

263
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,675
You didn't give me advice.
You gave me a pickup line.

264
00:18:07,925 --> 00:18:11,720
I told her I wanted to
"build a foundation and be friends".

265
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:17,559
Suddenly, through no fault of my own,
I became irresistible to her!

266
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:20,604
And her roommate!

267
00:18:21,313 --> 00:18:23,232
What about the "closeness"?

268
00:18:23,482 --> 00:18:29,321
Closeness, schmosness! There was
three of us, for crying out loud!

269
00:18:32,449 --> 00:18:34,034
Who wants pizza?

270
00:18:34,284 --> 00:18:36,161
I do! I do! I do!

271
00:18:36,412 --> 00:18:41,834
This is great! Can you believe
I found it on the second floor?

272
00:18:43,252 --> 00:18:45,254
- Who is it?
- NYPD.

273
00:18:45,504 --> 00:18:47,631
Oh, my God!

274
00:18:47,881 --> 00:18:51,051
Just a minute, officer!

275
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:03,605
- I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay.
- My God, it's him! It's that cop!

276
00:19:03,856 --> 00:19:08,068
- I can't believe he found me!
- Are you going to go to jail?

277
00:19:08,318 --> 00:19:12,698
If I go down,
you guys go down with me.

278
00:19:13,282 --> 00:19:16,910
Harboring a fugitive?
That's one-to-three years minimum.

279
00:19:17,161 --> 00:19:20,622
Good luck, Chandler.

280
00:19:22,499 --> 00:19:26,420
Arrest me, but you'll never
make it stick and you know it.

281
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:29,965
I have no choice, it's my job.
You understand, right?

282
00:19:30,215 --> 00:19:33,010
And you understand that
I'm calling my lawyer.

283
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:38,640
And once he puts you on the stand
he'll make you look like a fool!

284
00:19:38,974 --> 00:19:41,143
I don't like looking foolish.

285
00:19:41,393 --> 00:19:45,522
Maybe I don't arrest you today.
Maybe I came by and you weren't here.

286
00:19:45,773 --> 00:19:48,400
I'd love it if I weren't here!

287
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:52,696
Since you're not going to jail tonight,
I was wondering if you'd...

288
00:19:52,946 --> 00:19:55,616
...like to go to dinner with me?

289
00:19:55,866 --> 00:19:57,034
Me?

290
00:19:57,284 --> 00:20:01,121
Ever since you flashed my badge,
I can't stop thinking about you.

291
00:20:01,372 --> 00:20:06,710
You're the prettiest fake
undercover whore I've ever seen.

292
00:20:06,794 --> 00:20:09,546
Nice.

293
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:14,218
Wow, I didn't see that coming.
You're asking me out.

294
00:20:14,468 --> 00:20:18,514
I could've done it better,
but they're staring at me.

295
00:20:18,764 --> 00:20:22,893
I'd like to go out
with you, officer.

296
00:20:23,143 --> 00:20:24,895
- Gary.
- Gary.

297
00:20:25,145 --> 00:20:27,022
Okay, so it's a date.

298
00:20:27,272 --> 00:20:29,900
I got to ask you, though.
How'd you find me?

299
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:33,028
I ran your fingerprints
through the computer.

300
00:20:33,278 --> 00:20:35,989
This was listed
as your last known address.

301
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,241
Impressive.

302
00:20:37,491 --> 00:20:42,329
Not as impressive as you. Your record
shows you've done some weird stuff.

303
00:20:42,579 --> 00:20:45,207
We'll talk at dinner.

304
00:20:45,374 --> 00:20:48,961
- So I'll come by and pick you up?
- I can't wait.

305
00:20:49,211 --> 00:20:53,632
Don't worry, I won't just
take you out for doughnuts.

306
00:20:55,426 --> 00:20:58,345
He has a gun!

307
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:08,522
I'd like to return this couch.
I'm not satisfied with it.

308
00:21:11,859 --> 00:21:15,612
You want to return this couch?

309
00:21:15,863 --> 00:21:19,241
It's cut in half.

310
00:21:19,408 --> 00:21:24,788
- That's what I'm telling you.
- Did you cut this couch in half?

311
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:29,335
This couch is cut in half!

312
00:21:29,585 --> 00:21:34,590
I would like to exchange it for one
that is not cut in half.

313
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,344
You're saying this couch was
delivered to you like this?

314
00:21:38,594 --> 00:21:40,679
Look, I'm a reasonable man.

315
00:21:40,929 --> 00:21:44,558
I will accept store credit.

316
00:21:44,808 --> 00:21:50,356
I'll give you store credit
in the amount of four dollars.

317
00:21:52,358 --> 00:21:55,402
I will take it.
