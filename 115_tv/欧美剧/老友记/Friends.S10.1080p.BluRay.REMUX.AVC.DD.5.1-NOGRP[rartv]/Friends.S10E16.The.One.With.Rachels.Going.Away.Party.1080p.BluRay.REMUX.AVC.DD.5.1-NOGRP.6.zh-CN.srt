1
00:00:01,527 --> 00:00:03,757
All right,
let's play one more time, okay?

2
00:00:03,927 --> 00:00:06,839
And remember, if I win,
you do not move to Paris.

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,999
Okay. I can't believe
I'm risking this again, but you're on.

4
00:00:10,167 --> 00:00:13,637
All right, Joe, you remember the rules.
Heads, I win. Tails, you lose.

5
00:00:13,807 --> 00:00:15,126
Just flip.

6
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,837
- Tails!
- Damn it!

7
00:00:19,847 --> 00:00:22,919
So we thought we'd throw you
a little going-away party around 7.

8
00:00:23,087 --> 00:00:24,600
Oh, that sounds good.

9
00:00:24,767 --> 00:00:27,645
Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow.
Shouldn't you be packing?

10
00:00:27,807 --> 00:00:30,275
- It's all done.
- Oh, yeah, right.

11
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:34,759
And after I took a shower this morning,
I just threw my towel on the floor.

12
00:00:35,087 --> 00:00:37,601
- Oh, God, it hurts to even joke about it.
- I know.

13
00:00:38,007 --> 00:00:41,682
Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage
that I'm taking is in the bedroom.

14
00:00:41,847 --> 00:00:45,362
This is Emma's Paris stuff. These are
the boxes that I'm having shipped...

15
00:00:45,527 --> 00:00:47,722
...and that's the sandwich
I made for the plane.

16
00:00:47,887 --> 00:00:50,117
- Okay, so you've done some good work.
- Yeah.

17
00:00:50,287 --> 00:00:51,606
What about your carryons?

18
00:00:51,767 --> 00:00:54,839
Oh, well, everything that I need
is in here...

19
00:00:55,007 --> 00:00:57,362
...and my travel documents
are on the counter...

20
00:00:57,527 --> 00:01:00,485
...organized in the order that
I will be needing them.

21
00:01:00,647 --> 00:01:04,117
Oh, my God.
I have nothing left to teach you.

22
00:01:06,127 --> 00:01:09,358
- Where's your passport?
- It should be next to my plane ticket.

23
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:12,678
- Well, it's not.
- What? Well, maybe I put it in here?

24
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,326
Oh, it's not in there!

25
00:01:15,487 --> 00:01:17,955
Oh, no, I must have packed it
in one of these boxes!

26
00:01:18,247 --> 00:01:21,000
- Here, let me help you.
- Shoot.

27
00:01:22,847 --> 00:01:24,326
I can't believe I did this.

28
00:01:24,487 --> 00:01:28,036
At what point did it stop being funny
that I took her passport?

29
00:02:17,127 --> 00:02:19,561
Oh, wow, can you believe
you're only three weeks away?

30
00:02:19,727 --> 00:02:21,001
I know.

31
00:02:21,167 --> 00:02:24,762
- You don't mind me touching your belly?
- I don't mind you touching my belly...

32
00:02:24,927 --> 00:02:28,715
...but your hand's kind of blocking the
part where the baby's gonna come out.

33
00:02:31,327 --> 00:02:32,601
- Hey!
- Hey.

34
00:02:32,767 --> 00:02:37,158
Hi, Erica. Welcome back to town.
Wow, look how big you've gotten.

35
00:02:37,327 --> 00:02:39,318
That's because I'm pregnant.

36
00:02:40,047 --> 00:02:42,880
- Right. No, I understand.
- Oh, okay.

37
00:02:43,047 --> 00:02:46,483
I'm just always afraid that people think
I'm just fat with big breasts.

38
00:02:47,407 --> 00:02:49,159
No, no, I knew.

39
00:02:52,847 --> 00:02:56,078
- Okay, well, stop staring at them.
- She brought them up.

40
00:02:57,887 --> 00:02:59,957
I didn't realize
you were coming back so soon.

41
00:03:00,127 --> 00:03:02,163
In a couple weeks
I won't be able to travel.

42
00:03:02,327 --> 00:03:05,763
And I wanted her to get to know the
doctors and get settled into the hotel.

43
00:03:05,927 --> 00:03:09,886
- Why isn't she staying with you guys?
- Because we're moving in a couple days.

44
00:03:10,047 --> 00:03:14,040
Plus, hotels are fun! My room has
this little fridge full of free snacks.

45
00:03:15,247 --> 00:03:16,919
Erica, those things aren't free.

46
00:03:17,087 --> 00:03:20,079
They have one of the highest markups
of any consumer product...

47
00:03:20,247 --> 00:03:24,001
Ross, she's giving us her baby.
She can eat you if she wants.

48
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:27,558
I'll be right back.

49
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:32,720
Oh, man, I can't believe you guys
are leaving this place.

50
00:03:32,887 --> 00:03:35,321
I know. I know.

51
00:03:35,487 --> 00:03:38,923
You know, you could take it if you want.
The lease is still in Nana's name.

52
00:03:39,087 --> 00:03:42,682
No, no. This will always be your place.
It would be too sad.

53
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,156
Plus, how much a month does it cost
to feed Joey?

54
00:03:45,327 --> 00:03:47,363
Yeah, it takes two incomes.

55
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:49,882
Is Chandler here?
We talked about catching a movie.

56
00:03:50,047 --> 00:03:52,003
Oh, no, he doesn't have time for that.

57
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:54,556
You can go help him and Joey
pack up the guest room.

58
00:03:54,727 --> 00:03:57,560
Packing. Sexy cheerleader comedy.

59
00:03:58,247 --> 00:04:02,240
Helpful brother.
Creepy Ioner at teen movie.

60
00:04:03,767 --> 00:04:05,564
"Creepy..."

61
00:04:13,207 --> 00:04:17,086
- What are you guys doing?
- Try it. I can't feel a thing.

62
00:04:24,087 --> 00:04:25,884
Are you kidding?

63
00:04:27,487 --> 00:04:29,603
- This is packing?
- We're taking a break.

64
00:04:29,767 --> 00:04:31,041
From?

65
00:04:31,207 --> 00:04:33,198
Jumping on the bed.

66
00:04:33,767 --> 00:04:37,203
All right, Rachel's party is in a couple
of hours, and there's a lot to do.

67
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:40,404
Ross, you've got Geller blood.
You're in charge of these yahoos.

68
00:04:40,567 --> 00:04:41,966
- You got it.
- All right.

69
00:04:42,127 --> 00:04:44,243
All right, she's right.
We gotta get serious.

70
00:04:44,407 --> 00:04:47,285
Let's put Styrofoam peanuts
down his pants and kick him!

71
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:52,842
No, guys, she's right. We should get
to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet.

72
00:04:53,007 --> 00:04:56,363
Joey, you pack them, and Ross,
you repack whatever Joey packs.

73
00:05:00,727 --> 00:05:02,080
You guys hear a ringing?

74
00:05:03,967 --> 00:05:09,280
- What the hell is this?
- Hey, handcuffs. And fur-lined. Nice.

75
00:05:09,447 --> 00:05:11,722
I didn't know you guys had it in you.

76
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:15,365
Chandler, you don't have a sister,
so you can't understand...

77
00:05:15,527 --> 00:05:18,087
...how much this bums me out.

78
00:05:18,607 --> 00:05:21,201
I didn't know Monica had these.

79
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:25,326
Maybe she used them
with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard.

80
00:05:27,487 --> 00:05:31,082
Why would she use them with Richard
and not me? I can be kinky.

81
00:05:31,647 --> 00:05:36,084
I once did a naked dance for her
with scarves.

82
00:05:38,607 --> 00:05:40,563
Bumming hard, guys.
Bumming hard.

83
00:05:47,767 --> 00:05:49,166
- Hey.
- Hey. Where's Mike?

84
00:05:49,327 --> 00:05:50,760
Oh, he has a gig.

85
00:05:50,927 --> 00:05:53,646
It's kind of like being married
to a rock star, you know?

86
00:05:53,807 --> 00:05:55,798
My husband has a gig.

87
00:05:56,887 --> 00:05:58,161
Yeah? Where is it?

88
00:05:58,327 --> 00:06:02,366
Oh, he's playing organ
for a children's roller-skating party.

89
00:06:04,007 --> 00:06:05,599
Rock on!

90
00:06:06,647 --> 00:06:09,320
Wow, this is quite a spread.
What is all this stuff?

91
00:06:09,487 --> 00:06:12,684
I thought this would be a great
opportunity to use up all the food...

92
00:06:12,847 --> 00:06:15,680
...that I don't want to move
to the new house with me.

93
00:06:15,847 --> 00:06:20,682
So enjoy. Smoked oyster casserole
with a breakfast-cereal crust.

94
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:27,358
kidney beans in their own juices,
and for dessert, a questionable orange.

95
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,881
- Hey.
- Hey.

96
00:06:30,047 --> 00:06:31,958
- Where's Rach?
- She's putting Emma down.

97
00:06:32,127 --> 00:06:35,244
She'll be over in a second.
It just hit her that she's leaving.

98
00:06:35,407 --> 00:06:39,161
She's kind of emotional, so no one
say anything to set her off, okay?

99
00:06:40,407 --> 00:06:41,681
- Hey, Rach.
- Hey.

100
00:06:41,847 --> 00:06:43,724
There she is.

101
00:06:44,127 --> 00:06:46,322
Hi, you guys.

102
00:06:46,727 --> 00:06:48,160
What did I just say?

103
00:06:50,127 --> 00:06:52,766
Oh, no, no, no, it's okay. It's okay.
I'm gonna be fine.

104
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:55,395
- Come here, I'll make you a drink.
- Okay.

105
00:06:56,407 --> 00:06:58,967
Oh, man, I can't believe
she's actually leaving.

106
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,879
How am I gonna say goodbye
to Rachel?

107
00:07:01,247 --> 00:07:03,556
I know, she's been
such a big part of my life.

108
00:07:03,727 --> 00:07:06,287
It feels like when Melrose Place
got cancelled.

109
00:07:10,527 --> 00:07:12,119
I mean...

110
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:15,406
Forget it, I miss Melrose Place.

111
00:07:16,927 --> 00:07:19,282
- I had a chance to stop her too.
- Yeah?

112
00:07:19,447 --> 00:07:22,962
Who loses 57 coin tosses
in a row? You know?

113
00:07:23,127 --> 00:07:25,925
Heads, she wins. Tails, I lose.

114
00:07:30,687 --> 00:07:32,325
Wait a minute.

115
00:07:32,487 --> 00:07:36,526
- Yes, Joe?
- I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning.

116
00:07:39,847 --> 00:07:41,997
So you doing okay?

117
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:45,523
Well, I've been better.
You guys are gonna come visit, right?

118
00:07:45,687 --> 00:07:48,918
Yes! You know, in six months,
the statute of limitations runs out...

119
00:07:49,087 --> 00:07:51,681
...and I can travel internationally again.

120
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:56,838
- I'm gonna miss you so much.
- I know.

121
00:07:57,607 --> 00:08:00,565
You know what? I have some
goodbye stuff that I wanted to say...

122
00:08:00,727 --> 00:08:05,642
...to each of you. I was gonna save it
till the end of the night, but come here.

123
00:08:07,967 --> 00:08:10,401
Hey, what do you think
they're doing in there?

124
00:08:10,567 --> 00:08:12,239
If I had to guess, I'd say...

125
00:08:12,407 --> 00:08:15,877
...Rachel's putting on the bubble wrap,
and Phoebe's doing the punching.

126
00:08:19,287 --> 00:08:21,403
Pheebs, I don't even know
where to start.

127
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:25,480
Okay, well, before you do, I know we
weren't supposed to get you presents...

128
00:08:25,647 --> 00:08:27,877
...but I do have something for you.

129
00:08:30,687 --> 00:08:32,837
- What is it?
- Well, it's a cotton swab...

130
00:08:33,007 --> 00:08:34,725
...with a bit of my saliva on it...

131
00:08:36,447 --> 00:08:39,917
...so that if they perfect the cloning
process while you're over there...

132
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:43,204
...you can use the DNA
to create your own Pheebs.

133
00:08:47,167 --> 00:08:48,919
I'm gonna throw this away...

134
00:08:50,487 --> 00:08:54,196
...but thank you so much
for the gesture.

135
00:08:55,447 --> 00:08:57,039
Chandler?

136
00:08:57,407 --> 00:09:01,241
I was just in our bedroom,
and I found these on my pillow.

137
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:04,763
Oh, yes, I decided to leave those
out for you in case Richard stops by...

138
00:09:04,927 --> 00:09:09,000
...and you want to engage in a little
light bondage and mustache play.

139
00:09:10,527 --> 00:09:12,085
What? These aren't mine.

140
00:09:12,247 --> 00:09:13,521
Oh, yeah, right!

141
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:16,520
Good luck getting another scarf dance
from me.

142
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,876
That would be a terrible punishment.

143
00:09:21,607 --> 00:09:23,677
But I'm serious,
I've never seen these before.

144
00:09:23,847 --> 00:09:26,725
Really? Then what are they doing
in our guest room?

145
00:09:27,087 --> 00:09:28,805
Rachel used to live in that room.

146
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:32,403
Rachel. With handcuffs.

147
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:34,159
Interesting.

148
00:09:34,727 --> 00:09:36,319
Joey's bare ass.

149
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,044
Well played.

150
00:09:47,407 --> 00:09:50,285
- I love you, Phoebe.
- I love you too.

151
00:09:52,767 --> 00:09:54,041
Please...

152
00:09:54,207 --> 00:09:55,481
Please don't...

153
00:09:55,647 --> 00:09:59,083
Don't turn into, you know,
a French bitch.

154
00:09:59,727 --> 00:10:01,319
I won't.

155
00:10:03,007 --> 00:10:05,840
All right. Well, if I'm gonna do this,
I better keep going.

156
00:10:06,007 --> 00:10:07,281
- Okay.
- Okay.

157
00:10:07,447 --> 00:10:08,721
- Monica?
- Yeah?

158
00:10:08,887 --> 00:10:11,720
- Will you come with me for a minute?
- Sure.

159
00:10:13,207 --> 00:10:15,562
- Are you wearing waterproof mascara?
- No.

160
00:10:15,727 --> 00:10:17,683
Oh, you're so screwed.

161
00:10:22,887 --> 00:10:24,206
Hey.

162
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:25,641
What was that all about?

163
00:10:26,087 --> 00:10:29,159
She's gonna say goodbye
to each of us individually.

164
00:10:29,847 --> 00:10:31,838
Are you kidding? Oh, my God.

165
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:35,397
Yeah, I know.
It's gonna be even worse for you. God.

166
00:10:35,567 --> 00:10:38,081
Well, just get ready
to do some serious crying.

167
00:10:38,647 --> 00:10:41,525
Man, I'm not gonna be able
to handle this.

168
00:10:42,567 --> 00:10:46,446
Now I know how my students feel
at the end of each year.

169
00:10:47,367 --> 00:10:51,883
And why they act out
by giving me such bad evaluations.

170
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:57,683
Mon. Okay.

171
00:10:57,847 --> 00:11:01,920
I better just say what it is
I'm gonna say.

172
00:11:04,727 --> 00:11:09,482
None of the amazing things that have
happened to me in the last 10 years...

173
00:11:09,647 --> 00:11:11,842
...would have happened
if it wasn't for you.

174
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:18,285
No one has been more like a sister
to me.

175
00:11:18,687 --> 00:11:20,439
I know what you mean.

176
00:11:20,607 --> 00:11:22,279
You're like a sister to me too.

177
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:31,202
I don't know what I'm going to do
without you.

178
00:11:32,647 --> 00:11:35,400
You're the greatest friend I ever had.

179
00:11:35,887 --> 00:11:39,243
- Seeing you every day.

180
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,159
What?

181
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:45,356
I... I... I...

182
00:11:45,527 --> 00:11:48,963
- see you every day!

183
00:11:49,287 --> 00:11:51,437
That is so sweet!

184
00:11:57,727 --> 00:11:59,797
Oh, no, she took down Monica.

185
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,682
And I'm the crier in the family.

186
00:12:05,327 --> 00:12:07,079
Oh, God, I could be next.

187
00:12:07,407 --> 00:12:10,717
Maybe she won't talk to me if it
looks like we're deep in conversation.

188
00:12:10,887 --> 00:12:13,037
Oh, so that thing you said
about the thing...

189
00:12:13,207 --> 00:12:15,596
...it really made me think
about that other thing.

190
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:18,406
- Rach?
- Oh, it's okay, Chandler's talking to her.

191
00:12:18,567 --> 00:12:20,842
I really made you think
about that thing, huh?

192
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:29,081
Rach, I think I have something
that belongs to you.

193
00:12:32,807 --> 00:12:38,120
I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh
at your weird jokes that I don't get.

194
00:12:39,407 --> 00:12:42,797
No, no, they're really yours.
We found them in your old room.

195
00:12:42,967 --> 00:12:45,606
These aren't mine.
Maybe Monica used to use them with...

196
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:47,280
Don't say Richard.

197
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:52,357
Well, if they're not Monica's and
they're not yours, then whose are they?

198
00:12:52,527 --> 00:12:55,678
I think you're forgetting the kinkiest
former resident of that room.

199
00:12:56,167 --> 00:12:58,442
- Pheebs!
- Yeah!

200
00:13:00,487 --> 00:13:02,079
I think these are yours.

201
00:13:03,127 --> 00:13:07,359
These are not mine.
Look how flimsy they are. Come on.

202
00:13:09,007 --> 00:13:12,204
My God, you try to hang a guy
from a water pipe with these...

203
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:15,325
...they'll snap like a piece of licorice.

204
00:13:16,327 --> 00:13:19,046
- Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
- Sure.

205
00:13:22,127 --> 00:13:25,642
You don't really handcuff guys
to water pipes do you?

206
00:13:25,807 --> 00:13:28,446
Where do you think Mike really is?

207
00:13:37,127 --> 00:13:38,401
Oh, honey...

208
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,400
Let me just saying something
because once we get into this...

209
00:13:41,567 --> 00:13:45,321
...I'm gonna get all uncomfortable
and probably make some stupid joke.

210
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:50,086
I just want to say that l...
I love you.

211
00:13:51,887 --> 00:13:54,355
And I'm gonna miss you.

212
00:13:55,087 --> 00:13:57,601
And I'm so sad that you're leaving.

213
00:14:00,087 --> 00:14:02,157
Oh, you know what?

214
00:14:03,247 --> 00:14:05,522
Let's not say anything else.

215
00:14:05,687 --> 00:14:07,325
I love you.

216
00:14:09,287 --> 00:14:10,606
Not so tight.

217
00:14:13,847 --> 00:14:15,917
- I'm sorry, give me one more chance.
- Okay.

218
00:14:16,087 --> 00:14:17,679
Okay.

219
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:23,958
I'm sorry. Just go. Just go.
I can't. I can't.

220
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:31,965
- So I guess you're next. You ready?
- I don't think so.

221
00:14:32,127 --> 00:14:35,642
Oh, you're definitely not.
I haven't cried like that in years.

222
00:14:35,807 --> 00:14:38,002
You cried yesterday
at the 6:00 news.

223
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:41,398
That old woman was being scammed
by her mechanic.

224
00:14:42,807 --> 00:14:45,844
God, I can't believe
she saved me for last.

225
00:14:46,007 --> 00:14:47,679
Why are they taking so long?

226
00:14:47,847 --> 00:14:52,238
I don't know. But, God, Joey seems
to be handling it surprisingly well.

227
00:14:55,607 --> 00:14:57,677
- No!
- No! Joey!

228
00:15:05,127 --> 00:15:07,357
Okay, here we go.

229
00:15:10,447 --> 00:15:13,086
- Well...
- Yeah.

230
00:15:13,927 --> 00:15:16,122
I think I'm gonna take off.

231
00:15:20,447 --> 00:15:24,486
Oh, you guys, this was an amazing
night. Thank you so much.

232
00:15:24,647 --> 00:15:26,205
I love you.

233
00:15:26,367 --> 00:15:27,959
Good night.

234
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:33,439
What?!

235
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:38,642
I don't get a goodbye?

236
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:40,638
Lucky bastard.

237
00:15:47,727 --> 00:15:50,958
Unbelievable.
She says goodbye to everyone but me!

238
00:15:51,127 --> 00:15:54,358
Well, maybe she thought that
with all of your history, it could be...

239
00:15:54,527 --> 00:15:58,600
...you know, implicit.
- Well, it needs to be "plicit."

240
00:15:58,767 --> 00:16:02,203
All right, let's think about this.
I mean, there's gotta be an explanation.

241
00:16:02,367 --> 00:16:06,201
- Did you do anything to make her mad?
- No, I don't think so.

242
00:16:06,367 --> 00:16:09,837
You know, maybe she was just
really spent from our talk.

243
00:16:10,007 --> 00:16:11,838
- It was pretty intense.
- Yeah, mine too.

244
00:16:12,007 --> 00:16:13,963
- Mine was a humdinger.
- Okay!

245
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:20,761
I mean, don't I deserve anything?
I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug?

246
00:16:22,807 --> 00:16:25,082
Not from you!

247
00:16:26,167 --> 00:16:28,920
Ross, if you're this upset,
you should go and talk to her.

248
00:16:29,087 --> 00:16:31,442
And say what?
You owe me a goodbye?

249
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:34,883
- I mean, he's got more pride than that.
- The hell I do!

250
00:16:38,687 --> 00:16:40,962
- I don't get a goodbye?
- What?

251
00:16:41,127 --> 00:16:45,245
Everyone gets a goodbye but me?
What do I gotta do to get a goodbye?

252
00:16:45,407 --> 00:16:48,365
Be best friends with you?
Go out with you?

253
00:16:48,527 --> 00:16:49,880
Have a baby with you?

254
00:16:50,047 --> 00:16:53,244
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute!
I did all those things!

255
00:16:53,687 --> 00:16:55,723
- Ross...
- Or maybe I'm just not giving you...

256
00:16:55,887 --> 00:17:00,358
...enough credit. I mean, it is difficult
to say goodbye to five people.

257
00:17:00,527 --> 00:17:03,280
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,
goodbye, g...

258
00:17:03,447 --> 00:17:05,199
It's physically impossible!

259
00:17:08,247 --> 00:17:10,556
You know what?
After all we've been through...

260
00:17:10,727 --> 00:17:13,844
...I can't believe this is how
you want to leave things between us.

261
00:17:14,007 --> 00:17:16,157
Have a good time in Paris.

262
00:17:21,087 --> 00:17:24,159
- I hope Ross isn't too upset.
- I'm sure he's not more bummed out...

263
00:17:24,327 --> 00:17:26,238
...than I am.
- Tell me about it.

264
00:17:26,407 --> 00:17:29,205
Well, you can't say
we don't know how to throw a party.

265
00:17:30,127 --> 00:17:32,038
I think I'm gonna head out.

266
00:17:33,007 --> 00:17:36,602
- Where do you think you're going?
- I thought I was going home to bed...

267
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,679
...but I'm sensing there's something
less fun for me to do here.

268
00:17:40,767 --> 00:17:43,440
We're moving,
and we got a lot of packing to do.

269
00:17:43,607 --> 00:17:47,566
- It'd be great if you guys could pitch in.
- Joey and I can finish up the guest room.

270
00:17:47,727 --> 00:17:49,399
Yeah, good idea.

271
00:17:50,647 --> 00:17:52,956
Oh, no. You and Phoebe
are gonna help me in here.

272
00:17:54,367 --> 00:17:55,880
You couldn't be cool.

273
00:17:57,447 --> 00:17:58,960
We're gonna start in the kitchen.

274
00:17:59,127 --> 00:18:02,119
Plates get put into plate protectors
and stacked 10 to a box.

275
00:18:02,287 --> 00:18:06,075
The silverware gets bundled in rubber
bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?

276
00:18:06,247 --> 00:18:08,078
- Yeah.
- Good. I need you to be careful...

277
00:18:08,247 --> 00:18:10,807
...and efficient. And remember,
if I'm harsh with you...

278
00:18:10,967 --> 00:18:13,686
...it is only because
you're doing it wrong.

279
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:18,605
Hey, Mon, I think I figured out
whose handcuffs they are.

280
00:18:18,767 --> 00:18:21,361
- You did? How?
- Well, I was cleaning out the closet...

281
00:18:21,527 --> 00:18:23,802
...and I found some pictures of them...

282
00:18:23,967 --> 00:18:27,721
...being used.
- Oh, my God, let me see.

283
00:18:29,367 --> 00:18:30,766
Who's that dirty old lady?

284
00:18:32,247 --> 00:18:33,646
Monica's grandmother.

285
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:38,517
Oh, my God.
Nana liked it rough!

286
00:18:40,047 --> 00:18:41,685
- Hi.
- Hey.

287
00:18:41,847 --> 00:18:43,166
- Oh, here, have a seat.
- Yeah.

288
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,204
- How was your night?
- Oh, it was okay.

289
00:18:45,367 --> 00:18:48,006
I went to a movie with my cousin
then out for dinner.

290
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:50,397
We went to this place that had...

291
00:18:55,607 --> 00:18:59,043
Anyway, they had these
really amazing cheeseburgers.

292
00:19:01,727 --> 00:19:04,844
- Erica, are you okay?
- Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much.

293
00:19:05,007 --> 00:19:09,523
I keep getting these stomachaches.
They come and go every few minutes.

294
00:19:11,247 --> 00:19:15,479
- Oh, my God.
- Relax, we'll just get her some antacids.

295
00:19:16,007 --> 00:19:18,396
She doesn't have a stomachache!
She's in labor!

296
00:19:18,567 --> 00:19:20,922
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah, you gotta get to the hospital!

297
00:19:21,087 --> 00:19:24,875
Chandler, get the coats! Erica, let's go!
Phoebe and Joey, keep packing!

298
00:19:25,047 --> 00:19:27,481
Oh, my God, we're gonna have a baby.

299
00:19:28,207 --> 00:19:29,925
We're gonna have a baby!

300
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:32,078
Oh, my God,
we're gonna have a baby!

301
00:19:32,247 --> 00:19:35,319
Oh, God, I've gotta sit down!
I've gotta sit down!

302
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:40,357
- Honey, it's gonna be okay.
- You can do this. Just breathe.

303
00:19:40,767 --> 00:19:43,440
Okay. Okay.

304
00:19:43,607 --> 00:19:45,006
Okay, I feel a little better.

305
00:19:46,287 --> 00:19:47,959
Are you sure?

306
00:19:49,207 --> 00:19:51,675
- Yes, I'm sure. Oh, honey, let's go.
- Okay.

307
00:19:51,847 --> 00:19:53,803
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay, bye, everyone!

308
00:19:53,967 --> 00:19:55,446
- We're having a baby!
- Good luck!

309
00:19:55,607 --> 00:19:57,325
- Chandler, wait, wait, wait!
- What?

310
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:00,843
If you get a second, find out
where she got that cheeseburger.

311
00:20:08,087 --> 00:20:10,920
You think I didn't say goodbye
to you because I don't care?

312
00:20:11,087 --> 00:20:12,566
That's what it seemed like.

313
00:20:12,727 --> 00:20:17,243
I cannot believe that after 10 years
you do not know one thing about me!

314
00:20:17,407 --> 00:20:22,481
- Then why didn't you say something?
- Because it is too damn hard, Ross!

315
00:20:22,647 --> 00:20:27,084
I can't even begin to explain to you
how much I am gonna miss you.

316
00:20:27,687 --> 00:20:31,726
When I think about not seeing you
every day, it makes me not want to go.

317
00:20:32,727 --> 00:20:35,525
Okay? So if you think that
I didn't say goodbye to you...

318
00:20:35,687 --> 00:20:39,316
...because you don't mean as much
to me as everybody else, you're wrong.

319
00:20:39,487 --> 00:20:42,126
It's because you mean more to me.

320
00:20:42,287 --> 00:20:44,642
So there, all right?
There's your goodbye!

321
00:20:45,087 --> 00:20:46,440
- Rach!
- What?

322
00:20:46,607 --> 00:20:48,723
- You keep... You can't...
- What?

323
00:21:09,607 --> 00:21:11,757
- A little more.
- Okay.

324
00:21:12,567 --> 00:21:14,922
- A little more. A little more.
- All right.

325
00:21:16,247 --> 00:21:18,397
Little more.

326
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:23,047
- All right. All right, let's do this.
- All right, ready?

327
00:21:23,207 --> 00:21:25,675
Yep. Now give me your best shot.

328
00:21:26,407 --> 00:21:28,637
All right. Here goes.

329
00:21:33,607 --> 00:21:35,757
Doesn't work.

330
00:21:38,087 --> 00:21:40,078
