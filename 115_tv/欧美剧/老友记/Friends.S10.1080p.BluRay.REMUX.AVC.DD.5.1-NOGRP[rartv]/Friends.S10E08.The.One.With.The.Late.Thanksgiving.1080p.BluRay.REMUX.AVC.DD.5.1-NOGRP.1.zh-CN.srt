1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,394
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

2
00:00:03,572 --> 00:00:05,398
- Hi.
- Hey.

3
00:00:05,616 --> 00:00:07,193
We need to talk about something.

4
00:00:07,367 --> 00:00:10,533
Yeah. We don't feel like we can
host Thanksgiving this year.

5
00:00:10,745 --> 00:00:12,239
- What?
- Are you kidding?

6
00:00:12,414 --> 00:00:15,165
Well, it's just with work
and the stress of adoption...

7
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,242
...we don't feel like
we have the energy.

8
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:21,913
Plus, we don't think it's fair
that every year the burden falls on us.

9
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:25,422
That doesn't sound like you.

10
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:27,584
That's Monica talking.

11
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:34,513
- No, we made this decision together.
- She's putting words in your mouth.

12
00:00:34,725 --> 00:00:38,307
Don't you put words in people's mouths.
You put turkey in people's mouths.

13
00:00:39,438 --> 00:00:42,936
I can't believe this.
This is Emma's first Thanksgiving.

14
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:47,313
- No, it's not.
- It's not? When was she born?

15
00:00:48,738 --> 00:00:51,987
Well, personally, I think it's great
you're giving yourself a break.

16
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,821
- Thank you, Pheebs.
- Sure. It's just as well.

17
00:00:55,035 --> 00:00:58,818
I mean, last year wasn't very good.
I think she's losing her touch.

18
00:00:59,122 --> 00:01:03,249
- What? You are way off, lady.
- Am I? Really? Am I?

19
00:01:03,418 --> 00:01:06,916
Well, why don't you cook
Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong.

20
00:01:08,005 --> 00:01:11,669
Well, think about it. You'd be trying
to top what you did last year.

21
00:01:11,842 --> 00:01:15,044
You'd be in competition with yourself.

22
00:01:16,388 --> 00:01:18,214
That's my favorite kind.

23
00:01:18,723 --> 00:01:20,964
Okay, we are doing this.

24
00:01:21,142 --> 00:01:23,348
Don't let yourself
get manipulated this way.

25
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,267
Stay out of this, Chandler.
This is between me and me.

26
00:01:29,066 --> 00:01:32,648
We are supposed to make
these decisions together.

27
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,541
Did you not watch
the Dr. Phil I taped for you?

28
00:01:37,584 --> 00:01:39,656
The One With The Late Thanksgiving

29
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,290
- Hey.
- Hi. Happy Thanksgiving.

30
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:34,161
Happy Meatless Turkey-Murder Day.

31
00:02:35,332 --> 00:02:38,611
You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies
from that bakery on Bleeker.

32
00:02:38,787 --> 00:02:41,699
- Could you pick them up for me?
- You're not making the pies?

33
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,282
I don't make chocolate pies.

34
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:46,114
When I was younger,
I entered this pie-eating contest.

35
00:02:46,282 --> 00:02:48,898
I ate so many that the
thought of them makes me sick.

36
00:02:49,113 --> 00:02:50,770
Did you at least win the contest?

37
00:02:50,986 --> 00:02:54,064
Two minutes, twelve pies
and a part of one tin.

38
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,683
- Okay, I'll see you guys at 4.
- Can't wait.

39
00:02:57,856 --> 00:03:02,888
This dinner is gonna be so great.
In your face, last-year me.

40
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,511
- Hey, Rach?
- Yeah.

41
00:03:05,683 --> 00:03:07,174
What's Emma doing today?

42
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:11,043
Well, let's see, I know that she has
a meeting with her lawyer...

43
00:03:11,221 --> 00:03:14,998
...and then she has to make
a very big poop.

44
00:03:16,092 --> 00:03:19,869
- Why?
- I want to enter her in a baby pageant.

45
00:03:20,089 --> 00:03:23,866
Oh, my God. That's the creepiest thing
I've ever heard.

46
00:03:24,044 --> 00:03:27,407
Okay, but before you say no,
my friend Suzanne is entering her kid.

47
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,116
And compared to Emma,
she's a real dog.

48
00:03:30,872 --> 00:03:34,069
- Phoebe, all babies are beautiful.
- Oh, okay.

49
00:03:34,245 --> 00:03:38,531
No. Phoebe, just the idea
of pitting one baby against another...

50
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,027
...I mean, you know, and judging
who's cuter just for a trophy...

51
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,099
- And a thousand dollars.
...is something I'm very interested in.

52
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,846
Oh, please, do not tell Ross.

53
00:03:50,066 --> 00:03:52,766
He still believes that what's
on the inside is important.

54
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:56,881
Okay. And Emma needs
a cowgirl outfit for the competition.

55
00:03:57,102 --> 00:03:59,802
Where am I gonna get
a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?

56
00:04:00,017 --> 00:04:01,046
Well, I was thinking...

57
00:04:01,266 --> 00:04:04,463
Take the clothes
off Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid!

58
00:04:13,548 --> 00:04:15,336
Did someone drop the baton again?

59
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:18,955
Why come all the way
from Kansas to do that?

60
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,947
I don't get older, I just get better.

61
00:04:25,455 --> 00:04:27,112
You know what just occurred to me?

62
00:04:27,287 --> 00:04:29,903
This could be our last Thanksgiving
just the two of us.

63
00:04:30,077 --> 00:04:32,361
I mean, we could be getting a baby soon.

64
00:04:32,575 --> 00:04:35,026
- You don't know that.
- Somebody's gonna pick us.

65
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,773
But we haven't heard a thing
from the adoption agency.

66
00:04:37,946 --> 00:04:40,018
I'm telling you, it's gonna happen.

67
00:04:40,194 --> 00:04:44,480
Next year, it's gonna be
you, me and little Hemingway Bing.

68
00:04:46,106 --> 00:04:49,137
- What? He's my favorite author.
- Name one of his books.

69
00:04:55,058 --> 00:04:56,597
The Firm?

70
00:04:58,055 --> 00:05:01,548
Okay, let's see. Okay, the turkey's
in the oven. The stuffing is ready.

71
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:05,839
You know, you always cook this meal
all by yourself. Let me help this year.

72
00:05:06,008 --> 00:05:07,665
Oh, Chandler, that's sweet.

73
00:05:07,881 --> 00:05:11,492
But you don't have to do everything
Dr. Phil tells you to do.

74
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:17,081
I'm serious, let me do something.
Just not the turkey. Nothing high-profile.

75
00:05:17,332 --> 00:05:19,783
Okay, let's see. Oh, the cranberry sauce.

76
00:05:19,997 --> 00:05:22,992
It's easy to make,
and no one really cares about it.

77
00:05:23,869 --> 00:05:25,277
Tell me more.

78
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:30,111
I'm gonna go check on something across
the hall. You start by washing these.

79
00:05:32,238 --> 00:05:34,440
Not with soap!

80
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,852
You obviously haven't tasted
my Palmolive potatoes.

81
00:05:43,271 --> 00:05:46,965
- Hi. Hey, guess what Joey has.
- Three tickets to today's Rangers game!

82
00:05:47,184 --> 00:05:49,930
Dude, I wanted him to guess.

83
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,673
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, they're great seats too.

84
00:05:52,888 --> 00:05:55,670
- Guess where they are.
- Center ice.

85
00:05:56,844 --> 00:05:58,749
Did I do something to you?

86
00:06:01,299 --> 00:06:02,920
- The game's at 1.
- So?

87
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:07,161
- Dinner's at 4. We'll never make it back.
- So we'll leave before it's over.

88
00:06:07,377 --> 00:06:09,945
But it could take us
a long time to get back home.

89
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:14,494
Plus, Joey could get lost and they could
have to page us to go pick him up.

90
00:06:15,538 --> 00:06:17,941
Dude, two times that happened!

91
00:06:19,451 --> 00:06:21,440
Look, Monica's
been working hard all day.

92
00:06:21,616 --> 00:06:24,564
She didn't want to host
in the first place. We shouldn't go.

93
00:06:24,781 --> 00:06:26,059
He's right, man.

94
00:06:26,238 --> 00:06:29,269
- Yeah, I guess. So we'll see you at 4.
- Okay.

95
00:06:29,485 --> 00:06:32,350
And get ready to taste
my very special cranberries.

96
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:36,018
Or should I say "Chan-berries"?

97
00:06:39,686 --> 00:06:42,598
That's some gentle comedy, dude.

98
00:06:43,516 --> 00:06:46,594
- We're still going to the game, right?
- Yeah.

99
00:06:51,427 --> 00:06:54,872
This is contestant number 16,
Rebecca Hope from Yonkers.

100
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:57,121
- Hey.
- Phoebe, listen, I think we gotta go.

101
00:06:57,297 --> 00:06:58,753
This place is freaking me out.

102
00:06:58,921 --> 00:07:02,911
I've been watching this guy over there.
I don't think he came with a kid.

103
00:07:03,126 --> 00:07:04,321
But we can't leave now.

104
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,821
There was this one baby, Haley,
who was favored to win...

105
00:07:06,998 --> 00:07:08,987
...she got croup,
so she had to stay home.

106
00:07:09,163 --> 00:07:12,075
This competition
just blew wide-open, folks.

107
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,649
Phoebe, it's just too weird.

108
00:07:14,825 --> 00:07:17,311
I just saw a 1 -year-old
with pantyhose on.

109
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,604
Oh, I know. We should've
been more prepared.

110
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,940
It's okay. Now, the way I see it,
our real competition now is Cameron.

111
00:07:26,108 --> 00:07:28,013
My God, they just took her sweater off.

112
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,511
Look at those arms.
Hello, Michelin Man.

113
00:07:30,688 --> 00:07:34,429
Phoebe, come on.
You know what, it's already 3:00.

114
00:07:34,644 --> 00:07:37,758
They haven't even gotten
to Emma's group yet. We got dinner.

115
00:07:37,974 --> 00:07:40,886
But Emma's got what it takes.
She could go all the way!

116
00:07:42,971 --> 00:07:46,878
- Phoebe, you have to calm down.
- Okay.

117
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:52,581
Rachel, the hottest babies in the tri-state
area are in this room right now.

118
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:58,328
I overheard a judge say that
not one of them holds a candle to Emma.

119
00:07:58,542 --> 00:07:59,784
- Really?
- Yeah.

120
00:07:59,957 --> 00:08:02,739
- You heard him say that?
- Yeah.

121
00:08:02,955 --> 00:08:06,815
All right. Okay. All right, let's give
these babies something to cry about.

122
00:08:06,994 --> 00:08:10,984
Good. Let's get down to business.
Emma needs some makeup.

123
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,394
What?

124
00:08:12,614 --> 00:08:14,816
She's gonna look washed-out
next to the others.

125
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:17,396
No, I'm not letting you
put makeup on my baby.

126
00:08:17,611 --> 00:08:19,813
- Why not?
- Because I already did.

127
00:08:26,396 --> 00:08:30,800
You suck!
Get off the ice, you idiot!

128
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:34,171
- What a game.
- I know. Yeah.

129
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:37,545
- I can't believe Chandler's missing this.
- I'm sorry he's not here.

130
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,924
But I gotta say,
I am really enjoying nacho chair.

131
00:08:42,217 --> 00:08:46,456
Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more
if you didn't keep batting my hand away.

132
00:08:48,254 --> 00:08:49,626
- Yeah!
- These seats are great.

133
00:08:49,794 --> 00:08:52,991
I know, I know.
When I was here for "Holidays on Ice"...

134
00:08:54,749 --> 00:08:59,201
...I was sitting so far away,
Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner.

135
00:08:59,745 --> 00:09:02,906
We'd better get going. If we don't
leave now, we're gonna be late.

136
00:09:03,117 --> 00:09:06,480
But it's a tie game. So we're a little late.
The girls will be there.

137
00:09:06,656 --> 00:09:08,940
Let's just stay for one more goal.

138
00:09:09,196 --> 00:09:10,652
- I don't know.
- One more fight.

139
00:09:10,861 --> 00:09:12,731
- Okay.
- Okay.

140
00:09:16,357 --> 00:09:18,559
Where is everybody?
They're 45 minutes late.

141
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:23,881
I can't believe they're not here.
I slave and I slave for what?

142
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,469
They've ruined Cranberry Day.

143
00:09:28,473 --> 00:09:30,627
- How late are we?
- Forty-five minutes.

144
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:33,255
- Here.
- Okay.

145
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,253
Rachel and Phoebe are already there,
so they probably started without us.

146
00:09:37,424 --> 00:09:40,668
We could just slip in, and
no one needs to know where we were.

147
00:09:41,754 --> 00:09:45,826
- You may want to lose the foam finger.
- Oh, no, no, no.

148
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:48,701
You just want to put it on your hand.

149
00:09:52,413 --> 00:09:55,692
- You're not at Thanksgiving?
- No, we're late.

150
00:09:55,869 --> 00:09:58,106
- What are you doing here?
- We're late too.

151
00:09:59,324 --> 00:10:01,988
We figured we could be late
because you'd be on time.

152
00:10:02,197 --> 00:10:05,275
Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani.

153
00:10:05,444 --> 00:10:08,853
- Nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us.
- Yeah, where were you?

154
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,351
- Well...
- Yeah, what's with the trophy?

155
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:15,099
Well, we were at a spelling bee.

156
00:10:16,353 --> 00:10:18,093
And I won.

157
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:22,799
You won an adult
Thanksgiving Day spelling bee?

158
00:10:23,431 --> 00:10:26,509
Yes. Y-E-S. Yes.

159
00:10:26,678 --> 00:10:32,124
Let me see this. "Grand Supreme
Little Darling, New York Division"?

160
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:34,744
That's me.

161
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:39,372
You entered Emma in a beauty pageant?

162
00:10:39,543 --> 00:10:43,533
And it looks like she put makeup on her.

163
00:10:43,915 --> 00:10:47,857
Wait a second. Where have I seen
that cowgirl outfit before?

164
00:10:49,244 --> 00:10:51,446
I can't believe this. She's our daughter.

165
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:55,317
That you would treat her like
some kind of show dog is inexcusable.

166
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:59,521
- She won a thousand dollars.
- So this is an annual thing?

167
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:06,062
That's Alicia May Emory's outfit!

168
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,511
Guys, there are people in there
who are not getting any happier.

169
00:11:10,728 --> 00:11:14,339
- What are we gonna do?
- I gotta put Emma down for a nap.

170
00:11:14,558 --> 00:11:17,802
And, Rach, while you're in there,
throw something on Alicia May.

171
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:23,502
- All right, what are we gonna say?
- We'll say that we were mugged.

172
00:11:23,676 --> 00:11:26,244
You can't get mad at someone
who's been mugged.

173
00:11:26,424 --> 00:11:28,578
Good. But you don't look
like you were mugged.

174
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:31,123
No. Here.

175
00:11:34,751 --> 00:11:36,123
Hey!

176
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:40,527
Do you hear something?

177
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:48,735
- They're out there.
- Let me see.

178
00:11:49,365 --> 00:11:54,978
I can't believe this. They're an hour late,
and they're just standing there talking.

179
00:11:55,152 --> 00:11:59,971
Everything's so distorted.
It looks like Joey has a giant hand.

180
00:12:01,397 --> 00:12:04,511
That says "Rangers" on it.
They went to the game.

181
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:08,346
Oh, they are in for a world of pain.

182
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:14,379
- Ross' shirt is torn.
- They're late and they're sloppy.

183
00:12:16,344 --> 00:12:18,960
All right, Emma's napping.
What happened to your shirt?

184
00:12:19,258 --> 00:12:22,952
I got mugged, and they stole my pocket.

185
00:12:24,296 --> 00:12:27,078
We're just trying
to figure out an excuse.

186
00:12:27,794 --> 00:12:29,415
How about this?

187
00:12:29,584 --> 00:12:33,953
We could say that Monica told us 5:00,
not 4:00. That way we're right on time.

188
00:12:34,122 --> 00:12:40,480
Or we could plant PCP in the
apartment and call the cops on her.

189
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:46,734
That would be a good way to get rid
of all the PCP we have lying around.

190
00:12:46,904 --> 00:12:48,893
We'll just say that she said it was 5:00.

191
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:52,810
We'll just act casual.
We're not late, we're right on time.

192
00:12:57,854 --> 00:13:00,802
"We know you're out there."

193
00:13:03,475 --> 00:13:05,926
Who do you think it's from?

194
00:13:14,383 --> 00:13:17,083
Oh, God, this is bad. This is so bad.

195
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:19,707
Well, let's just go in there
and face them.

196
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:25,071
I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on
Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.

197
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:29,068
I hate that thing.
It's like a bolt of lightning.

198
00:13:29,288 --> 00:13:33,278
Why don't we play rock, paper, scissors,
and whoever loses, goes in first.

199
00:13:33,493 --> 00:13:36,026
- All right, I'm in.
- Ready.

200
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,401
I win.

201
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:46,264
- What is that?
- That's fire. It beats everything.

202
00:13:46,483 --> 00:13:49,514
Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon?

203
00:13:51,729 --> 00:13:54,926
Well-played, Phoebe Buffay.
Well-played.

204
00:13:55,102 --> 00:13:57,386
All right,
let's all go in at the same time.

205
00:13:57,558 --> 00:13:59,925
- Okay.
- Okay.

206
00:14:01,721 --> 00:14:05,332
- It's locked.
- What? Oh, sure, now they lock it.

207
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,499
When they're having sex on the couch,
it's like:

208
00:14:07,675 --> 00:14:11,002
"Come on in,
my butt is surprisingly hairy!"

209
00:14:12,755 --> 00:14:16,697
All right, come on. All right, you guys,
we're so sorry we're late.

210
00:14:16,877 --> 00:14:19,410
Please let us in so we can have
dinner together.

211
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:24,153
No, everything's cold. The turkey's
dried out and the stuffing's all soggy.

212
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:27,277
Yeah, and there's a bowl
of cranberry sauce that's...

213
00:14:27,452 --> 00:14:29,240
What happens to cranberry sauce?

214
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:32,570
- Nothing, it's fine.
- Oh, thank God.

215
00:14:32,781 --> 00:14:36,274
Come on, you guys, we're sorry.
Our subway broke down.

216
00:14:36,445 --> 00:14:40,139
That's a lie! You went to the game.
I can see Joey's hand.

217
00:14:40,358 --> 00:14:42,393
For the love of God, take it off!

218
00:14:45,771 --> 00:14:48,601
Guys, it doesn't matter
why we're late. We're all here now.

219
00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:51,930
Please let us in so we can have
some of your delicious turkey.

220
00:14:54,931 --> 00:14:58,009
I had a dream once
about a fax machine that did that.

221
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,629
That's all the turkey you're gonna get.

222
00:15:01,842 --> 00:15:05,749
- How are we gonna decide who gets this?
- Water balloon!

223
00:15:10,294 --> 00:15:12,958
What are we gonna do? I'm starving.

224
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:15,369
I just remembered,
we do have something to eat.

225
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,156
Monica put something
in our oven this morning.

226
00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:20,613
You touch that,
and you will be sorry!

227
00:15:20,827 --> 00:15:25,196
Guys, I'd listen to her.
The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it!

228
00:15:28,821 --> 00:15:31,142
Oh, my God, it's Brussels sprouts!

229
00:15:31,361 --> 00:15:33,728
That's worse than no food.

230
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:38,477
All you got was
Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts.

231
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:39,849
Stinky?

232
00:15:40,063 --> 00:15:43,390
Please let me stay on this side
of the door.

233
00:15:43,602 --> 00:15:47,095
Oh, I know!
I still have my old key.

234
00:15:47,265 --> 00:15:49,467
We can just unlock the door.

235
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:52,634
I don't know if that's a good idea.
They don't wanna be with us.

236
00:15:52,803 --> 00:15:54,507
I don't wanna be with them either...

237
00:15:54,676 --> 00:15:58,252
...but it's Thanksgiving, and we should
not want to be together together.

238
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:01,254
If I could just get in there,
make a face-to-face apology...

239
00:16:01,421 --> 00:16:04,085
...Iook them in the eye,
I could get them to forgive us.

240
00:16:04,252 --> 00:16:06,998
- I don't know.
- I'm telling you...

241
00:16:09,582 --> 00:16:12,577
...I can do it.

242
00:16:12,746 --> 00:16:15,067
Yeah, he can do it.

243
00:16:24,195 --> 00:16:26,349
It all looks so beautiful.

244
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:30,304
- The turkey, the stuffing.
- The cranberries.

245
00:16:30,524 --> 00:16:33,685
Enough! A monkey could've made them.

246
00:16:38,851 --> 00:16:42,130
Hey, listen, guys,
we feel really terrible.

247
00:16:42,598 --> 00:16:45,463
He's doing that weird eye-contact thing.

248
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:48,123
Don't look at him. Don't look at him.

249
00:16:48,344 --> 00:16:52,914
Come on, you guys. We want
you to know we're very, very sorry.

250
00:16:54,131 --> 00:16:56,203
Right, guys?

251
00:16:56,379 --> 00:17:01,079
- I feel terrible.
- Oh, so sorry.

252
00:17:01,292 --> 00:17:03,825
But let's not ruin this day.
You've worked so hard.

253
00:17:03,998 --> 00:17:07,242
Let's move past this and try to have
a nice meal all together, huh?

254
00:17:07,454 --> 00:17:10,568
The floating heads
do make a good point.

255
00:17:11,493 --> 00:17:13,363
Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.

256
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,107
- So bad.
- So bad.

257
00:17:17,613 --> 00:17:19,518
Okay.

258
00:17:19,695 --> 00:17:24,313
Okay, you two go get the dessert,
and I'll let you in.

259
00:17:24,941 --> 00:17:27,178
Dessert?

260
00:17:27,397 --> 00:17:31,885
Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up
the pies. You did remember, right?

261
00:17:32,102 --> 00:17:36,174
Pies. Oh, we thought you said "prize."

262
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,673
Here.

263
00:17:42,136 --> 00:17:46,624
- "Grand Supreme Little Darling"?
- Congratulations!

264
00:17:48,298 --> 00:17:51,909
Oh, my God, you forgot the pies?
Well, I cannot believe this.

265
00:17:52,128 --> 00:17:54,614
You forced me to make dinner,
you're an hour late...

266
00:17:54,793 --> 00:17:57,788
...and you forget the one little thing
that I asked you to do.

267
00:17:57,998 --> 00:18:00,993
Really, girls, not cool.

268
00:18:02,328 --> 00:18:05,773
Well, you man-heads aren't any better.
You lied about going to the game.

269
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,272
You knew it'd make you late,
and you went anyway.

270
00:18:08,449 --> 00:18:11,361
Hey, I'm getting a little tired of this.
We said we're sorry.

271
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:15,106
It's Thanksgiving, for Pete's sakes!
A day of forgiveness.

272
00:18:15,277 --> 00:18:19,397
- It's a day to be thankful.
- Don't make me come up there!

273
00:18:19,607 --> 00:18:21,063
It's too late for apologies.

274
00:18:21,231 --> 00:18:24,143
Fine, let's just go.
I don't need your stupid dinner.

275
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:27,218
That would be a lot more convincing
if you weren't drooling.

276
00:18:27,726 --> 00:18:30,923
- Oh, is that what that is?
- Sorry.

277
00:18:32,222 --> 00:18:34,790
Come on, you guys,
let's just do our own Thanksgiving.

278
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:38,249
- Yeah, I'll cook.
- Yeah, let's go out.

279
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,712
Yeah, you three
have a nice Thanksgiving.

280
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:46,249
- The three of us?
- Yeah. You, Chan and the vein.

281
00:18:57,911 --> 00:19:00,148
- I'm stuck.
- Joey, that is not gonna work.

282
00:19:00,326 --> 00:19:02,445
No, seriously.

283
00:19:02,616 --> 00:19:05,019
- I'm really wedged in here.
- I'll pull you through.

284
00:19:05,197 --> 00:19:06,357
Okay.

285
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:09,562
Stop, stop, I'm worried
about damaging my head.

286
00:19:09,777 --> 00:19:12,098
It's a little late for that.

287
00:19:12,983 --> 00:19:14,640
Hurry up, you gotta do something.

288
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:17,266
All right, well,
this does not change anything.

289
00:19:17,438 --> 00:19:19,510
We need to get something
to grease his face.

290
00:19:19,686 --> 00:19:21,840
- We got turkey grease.
- Bring it.

291
00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:26,096
I just want to say that I'm sorry I referred
to the vein as a separate person.

292
00:19:26,722 --> 00:19:28,545
Here you go.

293
00:19:29,512 --> 00:19:31,915
Oh, that smells good.

294
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:42,328
- Okay?
- Okay, try it.

295
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,114
It isn't working.

296
00:19:46,332 --> 00:19:49,825
- We're gonna have to unscrew the chain.
- Hurry, I can't feel my ears.

297
00:19:50,037 --> 00:19:52,358
Can you ever feel your ears?

298
00:19:52,536 --> 00:19:54,820
Interesting.

299
00:19:55,283 --> 00:19:59,225
- Chandler, where are your tools?
- Oh, I left them on my bulldozer.

300
00:20:02,486 --> 00:20:04,605
I don't have tools.

301
00:20:05,109 --> 00:20:08,187
- Well, I do, but Rachel borrowed them.
- I lent them to Ross.

302
00:20:08,357 --> 00:20:11,766
- I gave them to Joey.
- I left them at the park.

303
00:20:13,894 --> 00:20:16,261
I'm finding it really hard
not to mess with him.

304
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:18,465
I stuffed Brussels sprouts
down his pants.

305
00:20:18,641 --> 00:20:19,801
Nice.

306
00:20:21,097 --> 00:20:22,885
Okay, I have to get that.

307
00:20:23,054 --> 00:20:26,333
Now, when I get back,
I want you and your friends to be gone.

308
00:20:26,509 --> 00:20:30,830
Thanksgiving is over.
The vein has spoken.

309
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:36,160
- It's really starting to hurt.
- Look, I'm gonna pull on the door...

310
00:20:36,377 --> 00:20:40,319
...and you guys push. Maybe we can get
enough room to wiggle him out, okay?

311
00:20:40,499 --> 00:20:42,156
Okay, so push.

312
00:20:42,331 --> 00:20:45,740
Just a sec. We're kind of
in the middle of something here.

313
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,865
Hey, stop putting things
down my pants.

314
00:20:49,034 --> 00:20:51,899
- Come on, guys, push!
- Yeah, come on, push!

315
00:20:52,073 --> 00:20:54,310
Push! Push!

316
00:21:03,856 --> 00:21:09,350
- My cranberries!
- Man, I got food all over me.

317
00:21:11,225 --> 00:21:14,007
I can't believe what you did.
Monica's gonna kill you.

318
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:18,843
Look! Look! Look what the...
Look what the floating heads did!

319
00:21:20,718 --> 00:21:22,339
I don't care.

320
00:21:24,257 --> 00:21:26,660
What's going on?

321
00:21:26,838 --> 00:21:28,910
That was the adoption agency.

322
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:31,539
And?

323
00:21:31,709 --> 00:21:35,829
- We're getting a baby!
- Are you serious?!

324
00:21:41,577 --> 00:21:44,691
There's a pregnant woman in Ohio,
and she picked us.

325
00:21:44,908 --> 00:21:48,152
- Oh, my God, that's great!
- That's incredible.

326
00:21:49,571 --> 00:21:52,566
I'm so happy for you.

327
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,528
This Thanksgiving
kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!

328
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:12,676
To Monica and Chandler
and that knocked-up girl in Ohio.

329
00:22:17,738 --> 00:22:20,745
I'm just so happy you guys
are finally getting a kid.

330
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:25,333
- I know.
- Have you considered pageanting?

331
00:22:26,976 --> 00:22:31,898
I can't believe they called.
I mean, we're actually getting a baby.

332
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:33,947
I know how you feel.

333
00:22:35,963 --> 00:22:37,544
- Really?
- Sure.

334
00:22:37,719 --> 00:22:40,810
I went through the exact same thing
with Alicia May Emory.

335
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,907
The waiting, the wondering.

336
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:50,549
Then one day,
I get that call from Toys"R"Us.

337
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:53,643
She was in stock.

338
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,401
That is the exact same thing.

339
00:22:58,996 --> 00:23:00,029
