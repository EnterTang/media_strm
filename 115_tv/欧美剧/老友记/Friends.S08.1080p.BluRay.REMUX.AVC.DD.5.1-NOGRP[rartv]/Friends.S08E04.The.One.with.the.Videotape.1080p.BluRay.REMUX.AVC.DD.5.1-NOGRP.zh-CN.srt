A coupIe? Like two peopIe? Like one, two peopIe?

17
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:08,443
那不一样 葛瑞格跟珍妮结婚了
It's different. Greg and Jenny are married.

18
00:01:08,685 --> 00:01:12,314
葛瑞格跟珍妮? “嗨,葛瑞格,我是钱德”
Greg and Jenny? ''Hi, Greg. I'm ChandIer.''

19
00:01:12,522 --> 00:01:16,686
“嗨,摩妮卡,她是珍妮” “嗨,珍妮,嗨,摩妮卡”
''Hi, Monica. This is Jenny.'' ''Hi, Jenny. Hi, Greg.''

20
00:01:17,694 --> 00:01:20,720
-他们真的很棒,如果你们… -你知道吗?
-They're great. If you just-- -You know what?

21
00:01:20,964 --> 00:01:24,331
快送我们纪念品 然后滚出去
Give us our souvenirs and get out of here.

22
00:01:25,635 --> 00:01:29,162
-我们没有机会… -你是在开玩笑

23
00:01:29,806 --> 00:01:33,572
-我们没有买任何人的礼物 -好漂亮的项炼

25
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,373
片名:六人行 录影带风波

26
00:02:17,354 --> 00:02:20,687
-欢迎你们回来 -蜜月还好玩吧?

00:02:26,429 --> 00:02:30,126
我就知道 你们会未婚生子
I aIways knew you two wouId have a chiId out of wedIock.

-Look, I have a sonogram picture. -Good.

31
00:02:37,173 --> 00:02:40,836
罗斯,宝宝遗传了你的黑色卷发
Ross, it's got your wavy, bIack Iines.

32
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:48,017
现在罗斯知道了,到底是怎么发生的? 在什么时候?你们做了几次?
Now that Ross knows, how'd it happen? When? How many times?

33
00:02:48,218 --> 00:02:52,120
摩妮卡,那么问是不对的 从你们在哪里做开始说吧
Monica, that's not right. Start with where.

34
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:58,324
事情发生在六个星期前
It happened about six weeks ago.

35
00:02:58,561 --> 00:03:03,828
我回到家,发现罗斯也在 他跟乔伊混在一起
I got home and Ross was there. He'd been hanging out with Joey.

36
00:03:04,034 --> 00:03:05,228
别客气,兄弟
You're weIcome, buddy.

37
00:03:05,402 --> 00:03:06,596
制片:温蒂诺勒

38
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,864
编剧:史考特席维利

39
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,041
对,谢谢
Yeah, thanks.

40
00:03:13,743 --> 00:03:15,643
我有很多事要做 罗斯主动说要帮忙
I had a Iot of work, and Ross offered to heIp.

41
00:03:15,812 --> 00:03:16,801
导演:凯文布莱特

42
00:03:17,881 --> 00:03:20,543
我们边喝酒边聊天
We had wine, we got to taIking.

43
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:24,720
接下来 罗斯采取主动
Next thing you know, Ross comes on to me.

44
00:03:26,056 --> 00:03:28,718
那么说是不对的
That's a IittIe misIeading.

45
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:32,155
-什么? -你刚刚说的谎话
-What is? -The Iie you just toId.

46
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:37,022
-我说是你主动的? -没错
-That you came on to me? -There's the one!

47
00:03:37,233 --> 00:03:40,999
-但那是真的,老实一点吧 -没错,老实一点吧
-But you did. Let's be honest. -Yes, Iet's.

48
00:03:41,738 --> 00:03:45,538
罗斯,希望这有帮助,我不相信你
Ross. If it heIps, I don't beIieve you.

49
00:03:47,544 --> 00:03:49,535
那不重要
It's not important.

50
00:03:49,746 --> 00:03:54,706
重要的是我们要生孩子了 谁先泡“随”并不重要
What's important is, we're having a baby, not who came on to who.

51
00:03:54,951 --> 00:03:57,044
是“谁”才对
''Whom.''

52
00:03:59,589 --> 00:04:01,853
没错
That's right.

53
00:04:03,093 --> 00:04:06,688
-你先吻我的 -是你求我的
-You kissed me first. -You were begging for it!

54
00:04:06,963 --> 00:04:09,363
你发暗号给我
You were sending me signaIs!

55
00:04:09,632 --> 00:04:15,161
我发暗号给你? 谁觉得是我发暗号给罗斯求他的?
I was sending signaIs? Anyone think that I'd send Ross begging signaIs?

56
00:04:15,405 --> 00:04:17,896
请举手
PIease, show of hands.

57
00:04:20,076 --> 00:04:24,410
别人怎么想并不重要 事情真的发生了
It doesn't matter what peopIe beIieve! It happened.

58
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:30,017
或许我得小心一点 我正在发送讯号吗?
Maybe I need to be more carefuI. Am I sending these signaIs now?

59
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:34,814
-你知道吗?别谈了 -告诉我我是怎么求你的
-You know what? Just drop it. -Show me how I begged you.

60
00:04:35,091 --> 00:04:38,720
我可以证明 我都录在录影带里了
I can show you! I have it on videotape.

61
00:04:45,602 --> 00:04:47,934
那是一种说法
It's an expression.

62
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:59,009
瑞秋,快开门 听我解释
Come on, RacheI, open up. Let me expIain.

63
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,547
-她还是不让你进去? -对
-StiII won't Iet you in, huh? -No.

64
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,710
我要把门关上 我们得好好讨论你们的事
I'm just gonna cIose this door so we can taIk about you.

65
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:11,754
我不敢相信 他录下他们做爱的经过
I can't beIieve he taped them having sex.

66
00:05:11,928 --> 00:05:16,058
对,你得先告诉对方 才能开始录影
Yeah. You gotta teII a girI before you tape her.

67
00:05:16,432 --> 00:05:19,265
那是菜鸟才会犯的错误
Such a rookie mistake.

68
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:23,200
-你知道谁有很棒的摄影机吗? -葛瑞格跟珍妮?
-Know who has a great camera? -Greg and Jenny?

69
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:26,432
-我要打电话给他们 -快打吧
-I want to caII them. -Let's caII.

70
00:05:26,643 --> 00:05:29,942
问他们有没有 买纪念品送给朋友
Ask them if they brought their friends souvenirs.

71
00:05:35,618 --> 00:05:37,984
喂,第八街外送餐厅
HeIIo. 8th Street DeIi?

72
00:05:38,188 --> 00:05:42,249
快挂掉,光跟他们说话 你就会食物中毒
Hang up. You get food poisoning just taIking to that pIace.

73
00:05:42,492 --> 00:05:45,586
-抱歉,打错了 -来吧,宝贝
-Sorry, wrong number. -Here you go, babe.

74
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:51,089
喂 又是外送餐厅
HeIIo? It's the deIi again!

75
00:05:51,301 --> 00:05:54,168
好吧,我要吃三明治
AII right, I'II have a sandwich.

76
00:05:54,404 --> 00:05:57,396
我想这个电话号码是错的
I don't think this number's right.

77
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:04,076
-什么? -你们拿到假的电话
-What? -You got fake-numbered.

78
00:06:05,048 --> 00:06:09,314
-什么?没有人会那么做 -我想我们会
-What? PeopIe don't do that. -Oh, I think we do.

79
00:06:09,552 --> 00:06:12,612
-他们为什么要那么做? -我不知道
-Why wouId they do that? -I don't know.

80
00:06:12,922 --> 00:06:17,018
你们聊的很开心 你问了那些很棒的问题
You were a deIight. You asked those great questions.

81
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:22,196
你也很风趣 老是在开玩笑,你真的很耍宝
And you were never funnier. Joke, joke, joke! You were a hoot!

82
00:06:22,432 --> 00:06:24,957
你们还有我跟菲比
You stiII got me and Phoebe.

83
00:06:25,168 --> 00:06:29,127
对不起 我不要葛瑞格跟珍妮的退货
Excuse me, I don't want Greg and Jenny's rejects.

84
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:34,265
瑞秋不肯跟我说话 她不肯开门
RacheI won't taIk to me. She won't open the door.

85
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,468
我很好奇是为什么,变态
I wonder why, pervert.

86
00:06:37,013 --> 00:06:39,140
好吧,我不是变态
Okay, I am not a pervert.

87
00:06:39,382 --> 00:06:42,681
变态都是那么说的
That's, Iike, the pervert motto.

88
00:06:42,885 --> 00:06:48,517
你举起手,把左手放进裤子里 然后再说一次
You raise your hand, put your Ieft hand down your pants and repeat that.

89
00:06:49,192 --> 00:06:51,717
我不是故意要拍瑞秋
FiIming RacheI was not pIanned.

90
00:06:51,961 --> 00:06:55,192
事情的经过是这样的 乔伊可以帮我作证
Here's what happened. Joey can back me up.

91
00:06:55,398 --> 00:07:00,358
还记得一个半月前 我跑去问你一个问题吗?
A month and a haIf ago, remember I came to you with a probIem?

92
00:07:01,037 --> 00:07:03,699
我的私人问题?
The personaI thing?

93
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:08,967
-什么私人问题? -关于性的问题?
-What personaI thing? -About sex?

94
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,981
我好几个月没有性生活了?
That I hadn't had sex in months?

95
00:07:14,217 --> 00:07:17,118
我知道 你在说什么
Yeah, I knew what you were taIking about.

96
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,289
(六个星期前)

97
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:31,599
我想谈一件 我很难启齿的事
I'd Iike to taIk about something I'm uncomfortabIe taIking about.

98
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:33,529
没问题
Sure.

99
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:38,468
你跟你妈 一起洗澡?
How about you showering with your mom?

100
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:43,979
我真的有问题
I actuaIIy had a topic in mind.

101
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:51,887
我正进入了 性停滞期
I'm kind of going through a dry speII, sex-wise.

102
00:07:52,088 --> 00:07:54,886
-有好几个月了吗? -五个月…
-For, Iike, months? -Five, to be...

103
00:07:55,124 --> 00:07:57,092
骗人的,是六个月
...Iying. Six.

104
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,790
六个月?那一定很难熬
Six months? That's rough.

105
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:05,399
没有那么糟糕 我学着去欣赏一些小事,譬如说…
It's not aII bad. I'm Iearning to appreciate the smaII things, Iike...

106
00:08:05,601 --> 00:08:10,197
鸟叫声 跟天空的颜色
...the sound of a bird and the coIor of the sky.

107
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:14,206
天空是蓝色的,罗斯 我昨天做过爱了
The sky's bIue, Ross. And I had sex yesterday.

108
00:08:16,145 --> 00:08:19,012
拜帮帮我 今晚我有约会
PIease heIp me. I have a date tonight.

109
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:22,479
我得顺利达阵 我很担心我的健康
It has to go weII. I'm scared for my heaIth.

110
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:27,549
我有个点子 我想出一个故事
I got something. It's this story that I came up with.

111
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:31,557
非常浪漫 听到这个故事的女人都会心动
Very romantic. Any woman that hears it is putty.

112
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,319
说吧
TeII it to me.

113
00:08:33,563 --> 00:08:38,432
你听完后 一定会想跟我上床
Now, you're gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it.

114
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:41,569
记住,那只是一个故事
Remember, it is just the story.

115
00:08:43,072 --> 00:08:46,439
我会试着控制自己
I'II try to controI myseIf.

116
00:08:48,845 --> 00:08:52,941
多年前 我在西欧自助旅行…
Years ago, I was backpacking across Western Europe--

117
00:08:53,182 --> 00:08:58,620
-你在西欧自助旅行? -六个月后见
-You were backpacking across Europe? -Have a nice six more months.

118
00:08:58,821 --> 00:09:04,282
抱歉,求求你 你去了西欧,然后…
I'm sorry. PIease, pIease. You were in Western Europe, and...?

119
00:09:06,028 --> 00:09:11,432
我在巴塞隆纳郊外 在第比达包山脚下健行
I was outside BarceIona, hiking in the foothiIIs of Mount Tibidabo.

120
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:15,260
-太棒了 -谢谢
-Nice. -Thanks.

121
00:09:16,105 --> 00:09:20,667
我走到小路的尽头 发现了一座湖
I was at the end of this path, and there was a Iake.

122
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,937
它非常隐密 四周都是高大的树木
Very secIuded. There were taII trees aII around.

123
00:09:25,248 --> 00:09:28,809
那里非常安静 美极了
It was dead siIent. Gorgeous.

124
00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:34,990
我看到在湖的对面 有个美女在洗澡
And across the Iake I saw a beautifuI woman bathing herseIf.

125
00:09:35,258 --> 00:09:38,159
但她在哭
But she was crying.

126
00:09:39,862 --> 00:09:41,386
为什么?
Why?

127
00:09:48,438 --> 00:09:50,531
酒真的很棒
This is great wine.

128
00:09:50,773 --> 00:09:53,071
它是法国酒
It's from France.

129
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,074
法国在欧洲
In Europe.

130
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,871
就在西欧
Western Europe.

131
00:10:02,418 --> 00:10:07,788
几年前 我在西欧自助旅行
A few years ago I was backpacking across Western Europe.

132
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:11,790
-真的吗? -等一下,后面的故事很精彩
-ReaIIy? -Wait, it gets better.

133
00:10:13,963 --> 00:10:16,454
对,我在巴塞隆纳
Yeah, I was in BarceIona.

134
00:10:16,632 --> 00:10:20,500
我在巴塞隆纳过一年书
I studied for a year in BarceIona.

135
00:10:22,638 --> 00:10:25,573
-是吗? -对,你什么时候去的?
-You did? -Yeah. When were you there?

136
00:10:25,842 --> 00:10:27,036
-8… -89年?
-Eighty-- -Nine?

137
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,541
83年
Three.

138
00:10:29,812 --> 00:10:32,042
那时我才13岁?
I was 1 3?

139
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,686
-总之我在健行… -我喜欢健行
-So anyway, I was hiking-- -I Iove hiking!

140
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,856
那真的太棒了
That's great!

141
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:47,253
我在第比达亚波山脚下 健行…
I was hiking aIong the foothiIIs of Mount Tibidaybo--

142
00:10:47,497 --> 00:10:51,627
-我想是“第比达包山”才对 -你想说这个故事吗?
-I think it's ''Tibidabo.'' -Do you want to teII the story?

143
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,502
约会还顺利吗?
How'd your date go?

144
00:10:57,707 --> 00:11:01,700
太棒了 我正要过街去做爱
Great. I'm across the street having sex right now.

145
00:11:02,378 --> 00:11:07,281
-你的故事烂透了 -是你说的方法不对
-Your story sucks. -Then you didn't teII it right.

146
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,882
-告诉我你是怎么说的 -不,我不想谈
-Show me how you did it. -No, I don't want to.

147
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:16,423
-你上次看到裸女是什么时候的事? -我在西欧…
-How Iong since you seen a girI naked? -I was backpacking....

148
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:21,892
-我没有感觉 -我在巴塞隆纳郊外健行…
-I'm not feeIing it. -I was outside BarceIona, hiking--

149
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:27,730
-罗斯,我不热,你很热吗? -我六个月没做爱,每天都很热
-Ross, I'm not hot. Are you hot? -It's been six months. I'm aIways hot.

150
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:31,998
你不是在说故事 你根本就不相信它
You're not seIIing the story. You don't beIieve it.

151
00:11:32,241 --> 00:11:35,210
我得走了,我有约会 但试试这招
I gotta go, I got a date. But try this.

152
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,810
学我在试镜前做的那一招
Do what I do before an audition.

153
00:11:38,014 --> 00:11:39,709
我不饿
I'm not hungry.

154
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,510
不
No.

155
00:11:42,718 --> 00:11:48,179
我会用录影机来自拍 看看哪里做错了
Use my camera to record yourseIf and see what you're doing wrong.

156
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:49,983
我会试试看
I'II try that.

157
00:11:50,192 --> 00:11:56,495
已经设定好了,可以拍了 按下录影键就可以了,祝你好运
Now, you're aII set up. Good to go. Just hit record. Good Iuck.

158
00:11:56,732 --> 00:12:03,103
如果你跟女人约会出了问题 我可以帮你接手
If you ever have any probIem with the Iadies, you know I'II heIp you out.

159
00:12:07,777 --> 00:12:10,371
那对我来说意义重大
That means a Iot to me, man.

160
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:34,402
需要我帮你效劳吗? 要擦镜头吗?电池还有电吗?
Can I get you anything? Lens cIeaner? Your battery okay?

161
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:39,532
罗斯,谢天谢地你在这里 你得帮我
Ross, thank God you're here. You have to heIp me.

162
00:12:39,775 --> 00:12:42,539
你在自言自语吗?
Were you taIking to yourseIf?

163
00:12:42,812 --> 00:12:46,509
那会比较不丢脸 对,没错
That's Iess embarrassing. Yes. Yes, I was.

164
00:12:46,816 --> 00:12:50,752
她一走进来 我完全忘记录影机的事
When she came in, I totally forgot about the camera.

165
00:12:50,953 --> 00:12:54,616
录影机一直在拍 录下了整个经过
It kept roIIing and recorded everything.

166
00:12:56,258 --> 00:12:59,523
我们得看看 那卷录影带
Yeah, we're gonna need to see that tape.

167
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:04,197
那是个好主意 那会让瑞秋原谅我
What a great idea! That'II get RacheI to forgive me.

168
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,935
少来了,那就像是在看 探索频道…
Come on, it'II be Iike watching the Discovery ChanneI...

169
00:13:08,104 --> 00:13:10,004
只不过我们知道那两只猴子是谁
...onIy we'II know the monkeys.

170
00:13:10,973 --> 00:13:13,533
听着 我不会让你们看我们的性爱录影带
Look, I'm not gonna Iet you guys watch us.

171
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:18,442
-我自己都没有看过 -我可以用我的两卷录影带跟你换
-I haven't even seen it yet. -I'II trade you two tapes of me having sex.

172
00:13:19,081 --> 00:13:21,515
谢谢,我很感激
Thanks, I'm good.

173
00:13:21,684 --> 00:13:23,675
我们不是要看性爱画面…
We don't wanna see the dirty stuff...

174
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:27,822
-我们只想知道事情是怎么发生的 -不,瑞秋会杀了我的
-...just the stuff Ieading up to it. -No. RacheI's gonna kiII me as it is.

175
00:13:28,024 --> 00:13:30,993
那对她来说不公平 忘了录影带的事吧
It's not fair to her. Let's forget the tape.

176
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,419
谢谢
Thank you.

177
00:13:36,432 --> 00:13:39,265
-不 -你说的对
-No. -You're right.

178
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:44,804
-乔伊,不 -我了解
-Joey, no. -Loud and cIear.

179
00:13:51,514 --> 00:13:54,483
我不明白为什么 他们要给我们假的电话号码
I don't get why they'd give us a fake number.

180
00:13:54,950 --> 00:14:00,786
如果他们知道自己在做什么 他们不会给你们真名
If they knew what they were doing, they didn't give you reaI names.

181
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:06,189
或许有人会给假电话号码 但没有人会给假名
Maybe peopIe give out fake numbers, but not fake names.

182
00:14:06,462 --> 00:14:10,330
嗨,肯亚当斯 很高兴能认识你
Hi. Ken Adams. Nice to meet you.

183
00:14:10,966 --> 00:14:13,628
蕾吉娜菲拉吉
Regina PhaIange.

184
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:17,133
-我们没有做错事 -我知道
-We didn't do anything wrong. -I know.

185
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:22,602
虽然你说了 很多冷笑话
AIthough you did teII an awfuI Iot of jokes.

186
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:27,280
你说它们很好笑 快说笑话吧
You said they were funny. Joke, joke, joke!

187
00:14:27,516 --> 00:14:30,178
说笑话…
Joke, joke....

188
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:38,151
-是你问了太多问题害的 -我的问题怎么了?
-It was your questions. -What about them?

189
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:43,491
你问了太多问题 那像是跟谜题王坐在一起
The sheer voIume. It was Iike fIying with the RiddIer.

190
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,736
-那也是笑话吗? -那也是问题吗?
-Was that another joke? -Was that another question?

191
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,905
罗斯还在吗?
Is Ross stiII here?

192
00:14:53,075 --> 00:14:56,977
小心点,甜心 有人在问问题了
Watch out, honey. Someone eIse is asking questions now.

193
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:04,910
不,但他告诉我们发生了什么事 那真的是个误会
No, but he toId us what happened. It was an honest mistake.

194
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:09,989
如果我把我跟你做爱的过程录下来 你会有什么感觉呢?
How wouId you Iike it if I had sex with you and I taped it?

195
00:15:10,226 --> 00:15:12,456
算了吧
Oh, forget it.

196
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:19,263
他来了,我孩子的爹 西村的色情片之王
There he is, the father of my chiId, the porn king of the West ViIIage.

197
00:15:20,102 --> 00:15:22,536
那是个意外,行吗?
It was an accident, okay?

198
00:15:22,705 --> 00:15:25,970
我觉得很难过 我发誓我还没有看过它
I feeI bad. I swear, I didn't even watch it.

199
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,938
总之,拿去吧
Anyway, here.

200
00:15:29,211 --> 00:15:33,272
或许亲手毁了它 你会觉得舒服一点
You might be more comfortabIe destroying it yourseIf.

201
00:15:33,582 --> 00:15:35,573
谢谢
Thank you.

202
00:15:42,758 --> 00:15:44,919
什么?
What?

203
00:15:46,295 --> 00:15:49,958
-你们不想看这玩意吧? -我们当然想
-You don't want to see this, do you? -HeII, yeah!

204
00:15:50,966 --> 00:15:53,491
我不会让你们看这个
I am not gonna show you this.

205
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:57,728
我们不是要看性爱镜头 只是想看你们怎么开始的
Not the sex part. Just the stuff Ieading up to it.

206
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,999
算了,让她毁掉吧
Forget it.

207
00:16:00,276 --> 00:16:06,078
我们会想其他办法 解决“谁先主动”的问题
We'II think of another way to put the ''who came on to who'' thing to rest.

208
00:16:06,348 --> 00:16:09,283
快想
Come on now, think!

209
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:14,318
那是瑞秋的录影带 她想怎么处置它是她的自由
It's RacheI's tape, and she can do whatever she wants.

210
00:16:14,523 --> 00:16:19,017
她想毁了它 别说了
And she wants to destroy it, so end of story.

211
00:16:19,295 --> 00:16:23,061
-我想看 -什么?
-I want to see it. -What?

212
00:16:23,299 --> 00:16:25,426
你不希望我们看录影带
You don't want us to see this.

213
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:31,669
你不希望我们看它 让我想要看个究竟
You so badIy don't want us to see it that it makes me want to see it.

214
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:37,104
我们到底要不要看录影带?
Are we watching the tape or not?

215
00:16:37,847 --> 00:16:43,479
-我是要保护你 -我不相信你
-It's for your sake. -I don't beIieve you.

216
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:47,348
我想你不希望 他们看到你求我
I think you don't want them to see you begging me.

217
00:16:48,657 --> 00:16:52,559
-瑞秋,拜 -这是预告部份
-RacheI, pIease? -Oh, a IittIe preview.

218
00:16:54,196 --> 00:16:59,429
好吧,我要这卷录影带 证明我是想保护你
Fine. I want the record to show that I tried to take the high road.

219
00:16:59,668 --> 00:17:05,129
因为再过五分钟 我会说…
Because in about five minutes, I'm gonna be saying....

220
00:17:10,813 --> 00:17:12,713
好吧,要开始了
Okay, here we go.

221
00:17:16,085 --> 00:17:18,485
我好快乐
I'm so happy.

222
00:17:21,023 --> 00:17:24,823
谢天谢地你在这里,快帮帮我 你是在自言自语吗?
Thank God you're here. Help me. Were you talking to yourself?

223
00:17:24,994 --> 00:17:29,021
-我出现了 -你就要怀孕了
-There I am. -You're gonna get pregnant.

224
00:17:29,698 --> 00:17:31,359
我搞砸了
I screwed up so bad.

225
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,867
好几个星期前我告诉摩妮卡 我会把喜帖寄出去
I told Monica that I'd send those wedding invitations weeks ago.

226
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,529
你没有寄?
You didn't do it?

227
00:17:38,774 --> 00:17:44,041
我把它们放在办公桌上 直到今天才想起来
I put them in my desk at work, and forgot about them until today.

228
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:52,177
甜心,没关系的 客人都来了,我没事的
Sweetie, it's okay. Everybody made it to the wedding. I'm fine.

229
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:56,925
-但你把我的手弄痛了 -我知道
-Kind of hurting my hand though. -I know.

230
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:02,563
我不敢相信 何况摩妮卡每天都在盯我
I can't believe it, especially after Monica went on and on about it.

231
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:07,165
喜帖在这里,瑞秋 小心点,瑞秋
''Here are the invitations, Rachel. Be very careful, Rachel.

232
00:18:07,403 --> 00:18:12,170
拜,别在喜帖附近 喝东西,瑞秋
Please, drinking no liquids around the invitations, Rachel. ''

233
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:25,319
你们在我们的喜帖上面做爱?
Did you do it on our invitations?

234
00:18:27,623 --> 00:18:30,922
我们没在寄出去的喜帖上做
Not on the ones we sent out.

235
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:36,520
你们在我们拿去裱框 剩下来的喜帖上面做爱?
So just the ones you gave back to us and we had framed?

236
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:47,366
感觉上像是 他们昨天才订婚
It seems like yesterday they just got engaged.

237
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:49,440
我知道
I know.

238
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:54,872
还记得他们订婚那一晚吗? 你跟我差一点…
Remember the night they got engaged? How you and I almost--

239
00:18:55,117 --> 00:18:58,917
我记得我们差一点就做了
Oh, I remember how we almost.

240
00:18:59,121 --> 00:19:02,352
你觉得 我们真的会做吗?
You think we would've gone through with it?

241
00:19:02,591 --> 00:19:05,355
你觉得我们会做吗?
You think we would have done it?

242
00:19:07,296 --> 00:19:11,630
我知道我想做 但我不知道你要不要
I know I wanted to. I just wasn't sure if you did.

243
00:19:11,867 --> 00:19:14,700
我也想
Oh, I wanted to.

244
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:19,707
那么我们两个都想
So we both wanted to.

245
00:19:20,442 --> 00:19:22,842
真有趣
Interesting.

246
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:31,577
总之这样的结果 或许是最好的
Anyway, it probably worked out for the best.

247
00:19:32,187 --> 00:19:34,018
没错
Yeah, sure.

248
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,747
再过十秒他就要吻我了
In about 1 0 seconds, he kisses me.

249
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:40,554
再过五秒你们就会知道为什么
In about 5 seconds, you'II see why.

250
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:50,295
我有没有跟你说过 我到西欧自助旅行的事?
Did I ever tell you about the time I backpacked through Western Europe?

251
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:00,080
准备看她求我吧
Get ready to see some begging.

252
00:20:00,816 --> 00:20:04,650
-是你对罗斯主动的 -什么?
