1
00:00:03,867 --> 00:00:05,701
What are you Iooking at?

2
00:00:05,935 --> 00:00:09,939
A poster for that WWI movie I'm in.
Check it out.

3
00:00:10,206 --> 00:00:12,775
Wow! It Iooks reaIIy vioIent!

4
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:15,444
I know. I'm coming soon
to a theater near you.

5
00:00:15,612 --> 00:00:18,214
I'm in THX.
I'm unsuitabIe for chiIdren!

6
00:00:19,984 --> 00:00:23,854
-I cannot wait to see this.
-It's generating Oscar buzz.

7
00:00:24,054 --> 00:00:27,357
-I started that!
-I thought I did!

8
00:00:27,592 --> 00:00:29,660
I just taIked to my agent...

9
00:00:29,961 --> 00:00:33,865
...and the premiere is next week
and you're aII invited!

10
00:00:34,065 --> 00:00:36,034
-WiII we take a Iimo?
-Sure!

11
00:00:36,468 --> 00:00:40,138
I Iove taking Iimos
when nobody died.

12
00:00:40,372 --> 00:00:42,508
WeII, I won't be abIe to come.

13
00:00:42,775 --> 00:00:47,046
For those who haven't checked
their caIendars, today's my due date.

14
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:49,749
You shouId come.
Maybe you'II have the baby in the Iimo.

15
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:53,721
That way for the first few moments of her
Iife, she'II think we're reaIIy fancy.

16
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:59,526
I want to thank you guys
for how great you've been during this.

17
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:03,964
I couIdn't have done it without you.
I Ioved these Iast 9 months.

18
00:01:04,165 --> 00:01:06,434
I'm Iooking forward
to the next part...

19
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:09,370
...I am reaIIy gonna miss
being pregnant.

20
00:01:14,877 --> 00:01:17,546
That's right. StiII no baby.

21
00:01:19,014 --> 00:01:21,516
What's the matter? Is the puffy,
sweaty pregnant Iady...

22
00:01:21,751 --> 00:01:23,819
...disturbing your precious
coffee time?

23
00:01:25,521 --> 00:01:27,790
Come on, peopIe, make some room.

24
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:31,828
Sweetie, maybe you'd be
more comfortabIe here.

25
00:01:33,164 --> 00:01:34,731
You.

26
00:01:37,502 --> 00:01:40,405
Like you haven't done enough.

27
00:01:41,573 --> 00:01:45,843
I know you're miserabIe.
I wish there was something I couId do.

28
00:01:46,044 --> 00:01:49,481
I wish I were a sea horse.

29
00:01:51,884 --> 00:01:56,054
Because with sea horses, it's the maIe.
They carry the babies.

30
00:01:58,792 --> 00:02:02,529
And then aIso,
I'd be far away in the sea.

31
00:02:15,143 --> 00:02:16,711
God.

32
00:02:17,378 --> 00:02:22,583
I have never been so uncomfortabIe
in my entire Iife.

33
00:02:22,884 --> 00:02:25,253
I know. I remember toward the end--

34
00:02:25,454 --> 00:02:30,459
That's a great story. TeII it whiIe
you're getting me some iced tea.

35
00:02:33,295 --> 00:02:37,433
Oh, God, get out!
Get out, get out, get out!

36
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:40,870
Let's.

37
00:03:22,483 --> 00:03:25,452
Hey, did you have the baby yet?

38
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:31,192
Do you want me to sit on you?
Because I'II do it.

39
00:03:31,893 --> 00:03:35,429
-What are you doing here?
-They sent me home from work.

40
00:03:35,663 --> 00:03:39,100
They said, ''Start your maternity
Ieave now. Just rest.''

41
00:03:39,334 --> 00:03:41,303
You know what? Screw them!

42
00:03:41,504 --> 00:03:45,374
If they don't want me there,
I'II hang out with you guys.

43
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:49,745
Or you couId do voIunteer work.

44
00:03:51,247 --> 00:03:53,916
-HeIIo?
-Joey, it's EsteIIe.

45
00:03:54,217 --> 00:03:59,188
I was abIe to get you and one guest
tickets to your premiere.

46
00:03:59,423 --> 00:04:04,228
-You toId me I couId have six tickets.
-I soId four on eBay.

47
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:09,200
You'II be sitting next to HotGuy372.

48
00:04:10,902 --> 00:04:14,105
So that's it? I onIy get
to bring one guest?

49
00:04:14,372 --> 00:04:18,509
Yeah. What time you
wanna pick me up?

50
00:04:18,944 --> 00:04:20,578
HeIIo?

51
00:04:21,447 --> 00:04:24,883
You hear that?
I onIy get one extra ticket to my premiere.

52
00:04:25,084 --> 00:04:29,355
So somehow I have to pick
between you three and Ross.

53
00:04:31,058 --> 00:04:34,561
-What about me?
-You said you didn't want to go.

54
00:04:34,895 --> 00:04:37,765
I don't. But I wouId
stiII Iike to be acknowIedged.

55
00:04:37,998 --> 00:04:42,936
-Because I'm pregnant, I'm invisibIe?
-DefiniteIy not invisibIe.

56
00:04:45,106 --> 00:04:48,776
Ross didn't care enough
to be here, so he's out.

57
00:04:49,077 --> 00:04:52,847
-You snooze, you Iose.
-He's not snoozing. He's teaching.

58
00:04:53,082 --> 00:04:55,317
WeII, then somebody's snoozing.

59
00:04:55,517 --> 00:05:00,889
And, Joey, not that this shouId affect
you at aII, but if you pick me...

60
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:06,729
...I was pIanning on wearing
a sequin dress cut down to here.

61
00:05:07,798 --> 00:05:10,466
-I haven't seen this dress.
-Star in a movie.

62
00:05:12,403 --> 00:05:17,274
Pick whoever you want. Listen
to your heart. What does it teII you?

63
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:19,443
Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe.

64
00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:23,680
WeII....

65
00:05:26,351 --> 00:05:28,820
I think I want to take ChandIer.

66
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:31,756
Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe.

67
00:05:34,427 --> 00:05:38,397
-You want to take me?
-Yeah, I wish I couId take everybody.

68
00:05:38,631 --> 00:05:41,600
But ChandIer's aIways
supported my career.

69
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:45,238
He's paid for acting cIasses,
headshots and stuff.

70
00:05:45,505 --> 00:05:48,207
This wiII be my way
of paying you back.

71
00:05:48,442 --> 00:05:52,546
So you're never actuaIIy
going to pay me back?

72
00:05:54,048 --> 00:05:58,318
Just because he paid for your headshots,
you're gonna take him?

73
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:03,624
I don't think you're comprehending
just how sIutty this dress is.

74
00:06:04,492 --> 00:06:09,063
It's not just the stuff he paid for.
It's everything, you know?

75
00:06:09,365 --> 00:06:13,335
He read Iines with me. He went with me
on auditions when I was nervous.

76
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:16,838
Then he consoIed me
after I didn't get parts that I wanted.

77
00:06:17,106 --> 00:06:20,642
You aIways beIieved in me, man,
even when I didn't.

78
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:25,047
I aIways knew you were gonna make it.
I'm so proud of you.

79
00:06:25,248 --> 00:06:28,418
Thanks, that means a Iot to me.

80
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:35,726
Mon, maybe one of these guys
wants to wear your dress.

81
00:06:36,194 --> 00:06:41,332
-I'm gonna go shave.
-Yeah, weII, I'm gonna go spit.

82
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:47,806
I have to pee.

83
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:53,378
If I don't come out, it's because I've
choked to death on the potpourri stink.

84
00:06:54,947 --> 00:07:01,186
You hoId her nose, I'II bIow in her
mouth and the kid'II just...out of her.

85
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:06,026
She's a week Iate.
She's got to have it today.

86
00:07:06,227 --> 00:07:10,631
I don't know. I think
it's stiII gonna be a whiIe.

87
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:13,334
Care to make it interesting?

88
00:07:13,568 --> 00:07:16,971
-I bet you she'II have it tomorrow.
-You're on.

89
00:07:17,172 --> 00:07:20,708
-Okay, how much?
-One hundred thousand doIIars.

90
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:27,082
-How about 50 bucks?
-I'II caII Zurich and move some money.

91
00:07:27,316 --> 00:07:30,786
AII right, whose turn is it
to heIp me get up?

92
00:07:32,155 --> 00:07:33,922
No one's here.

93
00:07:36,493 --> 00:07:38,762
Oh, damn it!

94
00:07:51,842 --> 00:07:56,947
This is exciting. So gIamorous! PeopIe
taking our picture. How do I Iook?

95
00:07:57,482 --> 00:08:00,117
-A IittIe taII.
-What?

96
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:04,623
WouId you crouch down a bit
so that I Iook taIIer?

97
00:08:05,858 --> 00:08:08,194
There you go.

98
00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:12,531
It's just so gIamorous.

99
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:19,006
Oh, hey, Mon? Rach is here.

100
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:22,109
And you're stiII pregnant.

101
00:08:22,343 --> 00:08:25,346
I'm sorry. I know
how uncomfortabIe you are.

102
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:30,518
You know what? You Iook great.
Yeah, Iike 50 bucks.

103
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:38,092
I have to go pee. ApparentIy this baby
thinks my bIadder is a squeeze toy.

104
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:43,498
Damn it. Here's your 50 bucks.

105
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:48,904
That's interesting that you Iost.
Now, I forget, do you Iike to Iose?

106
00:08:49,105 --> 00:08:51,307
AII right, stop it.

107
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:54,710
-DoubIe or nothing she has it tomorrow.
-Fine.

108
00:08:54,945 --> 00:09:00,651
UntiI then, GeneraI Grant, why don't
you set up camp...right there?

109
00:09:01,819 --> 00:09:05,422
-RacheI here? We have an appointment.
-In the bathroom.

110
00:09:05,723 --> 00:09:08,926
-Rach, we gotta go.
-In a minute!

111
00:09:11,096 --> 00:09:16,468
PeopIe ask why we're not together.
I just don't know what to teII them.

112
00:09:16,669 --> 00:09:18,103
AII right, Iet's go.

113
00:09:19,572 --> 00:09:21,540
Oh, wait a minute.

114
00:09:21,707 --> 00:09:23,375
Do I have to pee again?

115
00:09:23,576 --> 00:09:25,644
No, I'm good.

116
00:09:25,845 --> 00:09:28,147
Do you want to go change first?

117
00:09:28,381 --> 00:09:32,285
The doctor's staying open Iate for us,
but if you hurry....

118
00:09:33,587 --> 00:09:37,123
-No, I'm fine.
-You don't think that's inappropriate?

119
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:41,061
-What?
-Good God, man. Don't anger it.

120
00:09:44,699 --> 00:09:50,605
Ross, it is 1 00 degrees outside.
For the first time in weeks, I am--

121
00:09:50,772 --> 00:09:54,409
Fine. Whatever you want.
You're the mommy.

122
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,578
No! Don't caII me ''Mommy.''

123
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:00,617
It's bad enough you caII
your own mother that.

124
00:10:01,317 --> 00:10:03,719
I'm actuaIIy with her on this one.

125
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:07,324
Come on, Ross.
We're gonna be Iate.

126
00:10:09,492 --> 00:10:11,260
Either of you want to be Ross?

127
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:22,005
I thought I knew who the enemy was,
but it was you.

128
00:10:22,273 --> 00:10:26,744
Okay, this is it. This is
my big fight scene coming up.

129
00:10:27,212 --> 00:10:30,983
I'm fighting for every man
in the 82nd Ground Division.

130
00:10:39,592 --> 00:10:43,128
Ross?
Can I ask you something?

131
00:10:43,429 --> 00:10:47,367
When CaroI was pregnant with Ben...

132
00:10:47,934 --> 00:10:50,603
...were you this irritating?

133
00:10:54,175 --> 00:10:56,343
-Excuse me?
-Nothing. You're just....

134
00:10:56,544 --> 00:11:01,783
You've been a IittIe short with me
IateIy. I'm not trying to irritate you.

135
00:11:01,983 --> 00:11:05,953
WeII, then, you must have
a naturaI taIent for it.

136
00:11:06,221 --> 00:11:10,758
The doctor wiII be in soon.
Why don't we not speak untiI then?

137
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,227
Okay.

138
00:11:16,665 --> 00:11:19,968
SeriousIy. Breathe Iouder, Ross.
That's great.

139
00:11:23,273 --> 00:11:26,376
We shouId ask the doctor
if she even knows...

140
00:11:26,576 --> 00:11:32,015
...how to deIiver a baby
that's haIf human, haIf pure eviI!

141
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:37,555
-Hi, Dr. Long. How are you?
-You're nice to her.

142
00:11:37,788 --> 00:11:40,758
She has the drugs.

143
00:11:41,727 --> 00:11:44,029
We'II do a quick check.

144
00:11:44,263 --> 00:11:48,000
Eight days Iate, huh?
You must be getting uncomfortabIe.

145
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,736
Yeah, just a tad.

146
00:11:51,738 --> 00:11:56,676
You're 80% effaced. You're on your way.
It stiII couId Iast a whiIe.

147
00:11:56,943 --> 00:12:02,048
-There are ways to heIp things aIong.
-Do them!

148
00:12:03,016 --> 00:12:06,787
ActuaIIy, they're things
that you can do. Home remedies.

149
00:12:07,054 --> 00:12:10,791
In my experience, I've found
some are very effective.

150
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:16,631
-WeII, we are ready to try anything.
-There's an herbaI tea you can drink.

151
00:12:16,898 --> 00:12:20,501
You can take some castor oiI.
There's spicy foods.

152
00:12:20,735 --> 00:12:22,503
We wiII do aII of those.

153
00:12:22,805 --> 00:12:25,074
-Taking a Iong waIk.
-Good. Done.

154
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:29,044
And there's the one that's
proved most effective: sex.

155
00:12:35,051 --> 00:12:38,521
You've got to be kidding me!

156
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:54,372
Good job, Joe! WeII done! Top-notch!

157
00:12:55,073 --> 00:12:58,276
-You Iiked it? You reaIIy Iiked it?
-Oh, yeah!

158
00:12:58,543 --> 00:13:02,980
-WeII, which part exactIy?
-The whoIe thing! Here we go!

159
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,651
No, no, no. Give me some specifics.

160
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:09,888
I Ioved the specifics.
The specifics were the best part.

161
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:15,962
Hey, what about the scene with
the kangaroo? Did you Iike that part?

162
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:21,802
I was surprised to see a kangaroo
in a WorId War I epic.

163
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,105
You feII asIeep!

164
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:30,445
There was no kangaroo! They didn't
take any of my suggestions!

165
00:13:32,347 --> 00:13:35,850
-I can't beIieve you feII asIeep.
-I can't beIieve it either.

166
00:13:37,286 --> 00:13:39,888
Maybe it didn't happen.

167
00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:43,225
Maybe you feII asIeep
and dreamt the whoIe thing.

168
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,596
And this conversation we're having
right now is part of that dream.

169
00:13:48,097 --> 00:13:49,765
Wake up, Joe!

170
00:13:54,805 --> 00:13:59,743
-Thanks for coming. See you Iater.
-Don't go. I'm so sorry.

171
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:04,081
Look, this guy feII asIeep!
He feII asIeep too! Be mad at him!

172
00:14:05,349 --> 00:14:07,185
Or caII an ambuIance!

173
00:14:12,124 --> 00:14:16,028
What did the doctor say?
Any news on when the baby wiII come?

174
00:14:16,195 --> 00:14:19,631
No. She gave us ideas
on how to induce Iabor.

175
00:14:19,832 --> 00:14:21,266
We tried them aII.

176
00:14:21,434 --> 00:14:27,173
We went for a waIk, we tried tea,
castor oiI, spicy food. Nothing worked.

177
00:14:27,473 --> 00:14:29,775
There is one thing we didn't try.

178
00:14:29,976 --> 00:14:34,047
But someone thinks that
that wiII open up a can of worms.

179
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:38,152
If it's gonna heIp
bring the baby here, today...

180
00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:40,854
...I think you shouId do it.

181
00:14:42,289 --> 00:14:45,726
-It's sex.
-Do it!

182
00:14:46,128 --> 00:14:49,764
-Monica.
-It's been a reaIIy Iong time for you.

183
00:14:49,998 --> 00:14:55,370
I mean, women have needs.
Do it. Get yours.

184
00:14:56,139 --> 00:14:58,507
Oh, I don't know about that.

185
00:14:59,843 --> 00:15:06,149
I think if the two of you had sex, the
repercussions wouId be catastrophic.

186
00:15:07,117 --> 00:15:09,319
AII right, Iet's be practicaI.

187
00:15:09,619 --> 00:15:15,625
If Ross isn't wiIIing, he's not
the onIy guy you can have sex with.

188
00:15:15,893 --> 00:15:19,196
You couId borrow ChandIer.
ChandIer is good.

189
00:15:20,731 --> 00:15:24,401
Okay, okay. Yeah,
I don't think I wanna do that.

190
00:15:25,303 --> 00:15:27,405
You sure? I'm just saying...

191
00:15:27,606 --> 00:15:30,075
...the baby's head
isn't getting any smaIIer.

192
00:15:33,212 --> 00:15:36,148
Monica, what is the matter with you?

193
00:15:36,415 --> 00:15:39,851
-I just want the baby to be born today.
-Why today?

194
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,754
Okay, fine.

195
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:48,028
I bet Phoebe that you're gonna have
the baby, and I don't want to Iose.

196
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:53,934
What? WhiIe she's been going through
this heII, you've been making money?

197
00:15:54,135 --> 00:15:58,639
You're betting on your friend
staying in this misery?

198
00:16:00,942 --> 00:16:04,445
-I'II take that bet.
-What?

199
00:16:04,646 --> 00:16:08,683
I'm miserabIe. I may as weII
make some money out of it.

200
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,186
Can I get some of that action?

201
00:16:11,487 --> 00:16:13,756
I'm betting against aII of you?

202
00:16:13,989 --> 00:16:16,959
I reaIIy feeI Iike
tomorrow it's gonna happen.

203
00:16:17,193 --> 00:16:18,894
Okay.

204
00:16:22,265 --> 00:16:25,501
Sixty, 80, 1 00.

205
00:16:25,702 --> 00:16:27,804
And 50.

206
00:16:28,672 --> 00:16:30,006
And two.

207
00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:33,611
Yeah, baby.

208
00:16:40,352 --> 00:16:43,521
Hey, SIeeping Beauty.

209
00:16:43,722 --> 00:16:47,893
Where have you been?
I want to taIk to you. I stiII feeI bad.

210
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:51,664
Oh, no. Were you upset?
Did you Iose sIeep?

211
00:16:52,531 --> 00:16:53,899
I'm so sorry.

212
00:16:54,133 --> 00:16:58,637
The reason I came over is to settIe things
between us. You've done a Iot for me.

213
00:16:58,838 --> 00:17:02,275
I wanted to pay you back
with the premiere, but you missed it.

214
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:04,778
-So how much do I owe you?
-What?

215
00:17:05,045 --> 00:17:08,615
-I don't want to owe you anything.
-You don't owe me.

216
00:17:08,883 --> 00:17:11,385
-I don't want your--
-We're doing this!

217
00:17:11,652 --> 00:17:14,455
You got me my first headshots.
How much?

218
00:17:14,856 --> 00:17:19,127
-I don't know, $500.
-Okay, $500. What eIse?

219
00:17:19,328 --> 00:17:24,100
Then there was the second set.
The infamous ''booger'' headshots.

220
00:17:25,234 --> 00:17:29,471
Okay, so that's another $500.
That's 500 and 500. That's....

221
00:17:33,843 --> 00:17:36,846
-You want a caIcuIator?
-PIease.

222
00:17:38,148 --> 00:17:39,816
Here.

223
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:45,756
AII right, what eIse?

224
00:17:45,957 --> 00:17:50,895
WeII, there's acting cIasses,
stage-combat cIasses, tap cIasses--

225
00:17:51,095 --> 00:17:53,998
Which we're stiII keeping
under our hats.

226
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:58,637
That diaIect coach who heIped you
with a Southern accent.

227
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:03,308
Which, after 20 hours of Iessons,
stiII came out Jamaican.

228
00:18:04,243 --> 00:18:09,782
What the heII are you taIking about?
The South wiII rise again, man.

229
00:18:12,485 --> 00:18:15,187
Yes, money weII-spent.

230
00:18:15,422 --> 00:18:17,558
Okay, what eIse? Rent.

231
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:22,429
Two, three years of rent,
utiIities, food....

232
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:27,168
Okay, so I'm writing you
a check for....

233
00:18:28,203 --> 00:18:34,209
So you feII asIeep during my movie.
Big deaI, right?

234
00:18:34,509 --> 00:18:36,611
How do you cIear this thing?

235
00:18:41,784 --> 00:18:43,786
Finish your enchiIada.

236
00:18:43,987 --> 00:18:47,957
Ross, we've tried aII the spicy food.
It's not working.

237
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:51,460
Okay, here, have one of these peppers.

238
00:18:54,331 --> 00:18:58,902
Oh, God. So hot. Oh, my God.

239
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:04,775
By the way, you don't want to touch
the pepper and then touch your eye.

240
00:19:06,577 --> 00:19:10,080
I am feeIing nothing.

241
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,255
Speaking of hot,
watching you do that...

242
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:20,125
...reaIIy makes me want
to have sex with you.

243
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:24,096
-Stop it.
-Come on! Why are we wasting time?

244
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:28,801
We know it's gonna work.
It's doctor-recommended.

245
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:34,808
I'm sorry. But we have to have
some boundaries. My God, I'm dying.

246
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:37,978
We've done it before.
We'II do it again.

247
00:19:38,246 --> 00:19:41,315
It'II be a nice way
to bookend the pregnancy.

248
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:45,086
I'm not gonna make Iove to you
so you'II go into Iabor.

249
00:19:45,354 --> 00:19:47,822
Make Iove? What are you, a girI?

250
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:53,862
AIways a great way to get
into a man's pants.

251
00:19:54,129 --> 00:19:58,667
You'II be performing a service.
Think of me as a ketchup bottIe.

252
00:19:58,868 --> 00:20:03,539
Sometimes, you have to bang on
the end of it to get it to come out.

253
00:20:05,576 --> 00:20:07,844
I Iove when you taIk dirty to me.

254
00:20:10,214 --> 00:20:13,150
I know it. You're right.
That's not sexy.

255
00:20:16,588 --> 00:20:20,024
Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork.

256
00:20:20,325 --> 00:20:22,794
Let me just bend over and get it.

257
00:20:30,236 --> 00:20:31,770
Oh, God!

258
00:20:34,808 --> 00:20:38,277
Okay, enough.
This is not going to happen.

259
00:20:38,545 --> 00:20:41,047
Come on, Ross. I'm miserabIe here.

260
00:20:41,315 --> 00:20:45,119
Come on, you started this,
now you finish it!

261
00:20:45,752 --> 00:20:48,688
Come on, wuss. Make Iove to me.

262
00:20:50,357 --> 00:20:53,493
-You know what?
-What?

263
00:20:53,828 --> 00:20:55,796
Forget it.

264
00:20:56,731 --> 00:21:00,000
What now, Ross,
you're not gonna taIk?

265
00:21:00,201 --> 00:21:03,905
How on earth wiII you ever annoy me?

266
00:21:04,206 --> 00:21:07,243
Oh, wait a minute, I know.

267
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:14,650
You'd think the jaIape?o wouId
cIear up your sinuses, but no!

268
00:21:14,917 --> 00:21:17,486
That's not enough--
What are you doing?

269
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,222
I'm getting that baby out of you!

270
00:21:27,398 --> 00:21:29,199
-Oh, God!
-I know.

271
00:21:29,467 --> 00:21:31,569
Oh, no, no, no.

272
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:35,206
I think my water just broke.

273
00:21:35,807 --> 00:21:37,876
I am good!

274
00:21:39,911 --> 00:21:43,982
Okay, I got the piIIow.
I got the bag.

275
00:21:44,183 --> 00:21:46,885
-You got the keys?
-I got the keys.

276
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,826
We're having a baby.

277
00:22:07,274 --> 00:22:12,213
I didn't have time to read this part
of the books, but do we have time--?

278
00:22:12,447 --> 00:22:15,317
-Not so much.
-Okay, Iet's go.

279
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,123
-200.
-Thank you.

280
00:22:21,324 --> 00:22:25,294
That's it. I don't care when
the baby comes. No more betting.

281
00:22:25,528 --> 00:22:26,695
Okay.

282
00:22:28,564 --> 00:22:30,265
HeIIo?

283
00:22:37,741 --> 00:22:39,909
I guess we couId bet
one more time.

284
00:22:41,345 --> 00:22:44,148
-Is RacheI having the baby?
-How did you know that?

285
00:22:46,084 --> 00:22:49,287
-Joey! ChandIer!
-They're at the coffee house.

286
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,989
You know everything!

287
00:22:52,223 --> 00:22:55,526
Wait. I bet you the baby
is over 7 pounds.

288
00:22:56,828 --> 00:23:00,498
I bet you it has hair!
I bet you it's a girI.

289
00:23:00,733 --> 00:23:04,471
-We know it's a girI.
-I'II give you reaIIy good odds.
