1
00:00:02,802 --> 00:00:05,430
Aren't you excited we're going on our honeymoon?

2
00:00:05,638 --> 00:00:06,798
Yeah, I am.

3
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:12,470
That's right, get it out of your system while we're alone.

4
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:17,075
- Hey. We came to say goodbye. 
- Yeah. Have a great honeymoon.

5
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:19,012
- Thanks.
- I better go pack.

6
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:22,711
No, I already packed. The only thing I couldn't find, though, was your Speedo.

7
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:29,253
Speedo? I don't have a Speedo.

8
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:33,592
I'm gonna go pack my regular, long bathing suit.

9
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:39,094
Good, you're still here! 
I wanted to tell you to have a good honeymoon.

10
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:40,738
Thank you!

11
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,933
And I also wanted you guys to know that I am telling the father today.

12
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:50,748
What? What?

13
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:55,682
- We know it's Ross. 
- How? How do you know?

14
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,722
It was his sweater. But, oh, my God!

15
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:03,023
I so wanted Ross to know first. 
But I am so relieved that you guys know!

16
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,595
That is so great. 
And I'm gonna be your baby's aunt!

17
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:06,924
I know.

18
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:08,634
Me too!

19
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,867
And I'm gonna be an uncle! Come here.

20
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:16,670
- You're all gonna be aunts and uncles. 
- Yeah, but I'm the only one related by blood.

21
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:23,438
So now that you all know, you can help me. 
Give me some advice on how to tell Ross.

22
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,878
What were you gonna say?

23
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:29,214
I was gonna tell him that I'm gonna have it, and he can be as involved as he wants.

24
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,014
Well, that sounds good.

25
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:35,490
Yeah, but, you know, how do I start? 
I mean, what's the first thing that I say?

26
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:42,263
- Okay, great. Thanks.
- Hey, good luck.

27
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:44,096
Yeah, bye.

28
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:46,765
Hey, what was that all about?

29
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:51,069
Guess there's no harm in telling you now. 
Rachel and Ross are going to have a baby.

30
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:56,681
What?! I didn't even know that...! 
Why didn't you tell me?

31
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,380
Why am I talking like this?

32
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,151
- I didn't think you could keep it a secret. 
- What?!

33
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:07,689
What?!

34
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,555
I am an excellent secret-keeper. 
I have kept all our secrets.

35
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,395
- What secrets?
- No, no, Joey.

36
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:18,401
I'm not gonna tell you, because I am an excellent secret-keeper.

37
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:24,366
- You'll tell me later? 
- You already know.

38
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:29,880
The One Where Rachel Tells Ross

41
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:07,617
It's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon.

42
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:11,981
You know, Monica and Chandler are married. 
Ross and Rachel are having a baby.

43
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:17,323
- Maybe you and I should do something. 
- All in good time, my love. All in good time.

44
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:23,663
Shoot! I left my guitar in their apartment. 
Well, you can let me in later, right?

45
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:26,235
No, I don't have a key. They took mine to give to you.

46
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:31,274
- What? They took mine to give to you. 
- Why would they take away our keys?

47
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:32,842
Maybe they don't trust us.

48
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,809
They let me keep my key the last time they were out of town.

49
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:40,611
The time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it with Monica's guest towels?

50
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,583
- Hey, I washed those.
- No, you didn't.

51
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:45,951
Yeah, that didn't sound like me.

52
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:50,955
- What will I do? I really need my guitar. 
- I have stuff in there too.

53
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:55,498
- What stuff? 
- Monica's chicken parm. I'll take care of it.

54
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,305
Hey, Mr. Treeger? It's Joey Tribbiani.

55
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:03,669
Listen, I need to get into Monica and Chandler's apartment. 
It's an emergency!

56
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,246
Gas leak. Oh, and bring garlic bread.

57
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,683
- Hey, did Monica and Chandler take off yet? 
- Yeah.

58
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:18,781
Damn. They left without my pass to the Nassau Fossil and Natural History Museum.

59
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,618
There goes the honeymoon.

60
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,259
- Did Rachel find you?
- No, why?

61
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,958
She was looking for you.

62
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,033
Well, I guess I'll catch up with her later.

63
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:35,299
- She really wanted to talk to you now. 
- Yeah, it seemed pretty important.

64
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:39,111
Oh, no.

65
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:40,643
What?

66
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:44,009
I think I might know what this is about.

67
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,280
Really?

68
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,753
Yeah. We promised we weren't gonna tell anybody this, but...

69
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,526
About a month ago, Rachel and I slept together.

70
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,429
And?

71
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:06,262
Wow, I thought you'd be a little more shocked.

72
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:09,171
Oh, sorry. And?!

73
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:17,042
Well, we said we'd just do it that one time...

74
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:20,946
...but now I think she may wanna start things up again.

75
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,714
Yeah, I don't think that's what it is.

76
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:29,424
- Why? What else could it be? 
- Oh, wow, I don't feel well.

77
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:34,165
I'm telling you, that's what it is.

78
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:38,336
No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding.

79
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,364
She didn't say anything to you?

80
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:44,109
- Maybe it's something you ate. 
- Could be, yeah.

81
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:48,670
- Please, just go and talk to Rachel. 
- Yeah, I guess I should.

82
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:53,349
Man, you know what I have to realize?

83
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:58,081
Maybe I'm not the type of guy women can have just one night with.

84
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:03,620
You know, they always seem to want a little bit more.

85
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:07,132
I should remember that.

86
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,000
Next.

87
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:22,303
- They're kissing. Let's just go around them. 
- Leave them alone. They're in love.

88
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:25,746
I'm in love too. But in an orderly fashion.

89
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,214
Next.

90
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,015
Hi. Can you do that and walk? 
Because she said, "Next."

91
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:35,926
Sorry, we didn't hear you. We're on our honeymoon.

92
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:41,930
Let me see what I can do. 
There are some first-class seats available.

93
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:45,626
They bumped them up to first class because they're on their honeymoon!

94
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:50,070
- Let's act like we're on our honeymoon. 
- We are on our honeymoon.

95
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:51,937
Grab my ass.

96
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:56,179
- Next.
- Hi. Sorry, I almost didn't hear you.

97
00:06:56,382 --> 00:07:00,512
You know, I'm just so in love with my new husband. 
We're on our honeymoon.

98
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,449
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

99
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:07,615
Okay, Mr. Bing, you'll be in 25J, and Mrs. Bing, you're in 25K.

100
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,320
We're on our honeymoon, so can you do your little thing and bump us to first class?

101
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:16,127
I'm sorry, all the first-class seats are taken. 
That couple got the last two.

102
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:21,773
See? If we'd gone around them like I said, 
she'd have given us those tickets! Damn it!

103
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:25,569
25J and K, any chance those aren't together?

104
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:37,319
I still can't believe they took away my key. 
I mean, you trust me with yours.

105
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:39,957
Of course I do! And I'm gonna get it back to you...

106
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:43,651
...just as soon as they're done with it at the key-shining place.

107
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,392
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.

108
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:52,700
Treeger, what are you doing?

109
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:55,465
- You said there was a gas leak. 
- Why not use your key?

110
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:58,974
By the time I found it on this thing, the whole place might have exploded.

111
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:02,636
If that happens at another building I manage, people will ask questions.

112
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,373
Come on, hurry up!

113
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:09,516
Well, we could have done that.

114
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:15,555
Look at that! They're going into the first-class lounge.

115
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:17,626
- Do you know what they have in there?
- No.

116
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:20,059
Me neither. We have to get in!

117
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:25,460
- Just act like you belong. 
- Oh, my God! Oranges!

118
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:31,672
- Nice to see you again. 
- Sir, may I see your tickets, please?

119
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:34,070
Yes, of course.

120
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,615
Would you move your thumb? 
I can't see the seat number.

121
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,718
That's all right. I have it memorized. 
It's 1 A.

122
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:47,087
- Sir, this isn't a first-class ticket. I'm sorry. 
- Apology accepted. Excuse us.

123
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:51,422
Sir, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

124
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:53,763
Fine.

125
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,293
Go, go!

126
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:10,813
- Hi.
- Hi.

127
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,377
Hi.

128
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:16,879
I think there's something that we really need to talk about.

129
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:20,957
I think we do. Why don't we go inside.

130
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:30,992
- Look, I know why you're here. 
- You do?

131
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:34,229
Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment...

132
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,204
...I think maybe I should talk first.

133
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,775
- Okay.
- Okay?

134
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:50,218
Ross and Rachel.

135
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,288
Rachel and Ross.

136
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,827
That's been one heck of a seesaw, hasn't it?

137
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,225
What?

138
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:06,928
I mean, look, that one night we had was fun and certainly passionate.

139
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:11,371
But don't you think it's better if we just stay friends?

140
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,509
Seriously, what?

141
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:19,076
Okay. You know what?

142
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:23,846
If you want to, we can do it one more time.

143
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:29,922
I mean, I'd be okay with that. 
In fact, I have some time right now...

144
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,096
Okay.

145
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,161
You know what? Can I talk now?

146
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,163
- Oh, sure.
- Okay.

147
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,001
I'm pregnant.

148
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:48,674
Ross?

149
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,717
Ross?

150
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:58,417
Okay, whenever you're ready.

151
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:07,995
And you're the father, by the way. But you got...

152
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:16,304
- Can I get you some water?
- I'm good.

153
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:22,710
Ross, there is no pressure on you, okay? 
I mean, you can be as involved as you want.

154
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:28,286
Yeah, I...

155
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,786
I'm just, I don't know. I don't understand...

156
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,724
...how this happened.

157
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:41,498
- We used a condom.
- I know.

158
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:46,570
But you know, condoms only work, like, 97 percent of the time.

159
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:48,530
What?

160
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:52,166
What?!

161
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,906
Well, they should put that on the box!

162
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,719
- They do.
- No, they don't!

163
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:11,687
Well, they should put it in huge block letters!

164
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:17,028
- Ross, let's just forget about the condoms. 
- Well, I may as well have!

165
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:21,432
Listen, you know what? I was really freaked out too...

166
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,302
...when I found out.
- Freaked...? 
Hey, I'm not freaked out.

167
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:28,538
I'm indignant as a consumer!

168
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:34,042
- You know what? Let's talk later. 
- No, I wanna talk now.

169
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,278
In fact, I wanna talk...

170
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:40,425
...to the president of the condom company.

171
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:42,924
Okay, you know what? 
Maybe I should come back... Okay.

172
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:46,357
Yeah, I'll press one!

173
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:55,572
- I looked everywhere. There's no gas leak. 
- So then I can heat this up?

174
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:58,403
Anyway, I'll get moving on that new door.

175
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:03,343
Great. Listen, could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler and Monica about this?

176
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:07,040
Because, you know, they don't have any kids of their own...

177
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:10,381
...and this door was like a child to them.

178
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:14,685
Well, I'm gonna have to put on a new lock. 
They'll find out anyway.

179
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:20,895
It's looking like an all-day job.
 I'm gonna have to cancel my yoga class.

180
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,428
Hey, Ross. Could you tell Jasmine I can't make it to yoga class today?

181
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:25,831
Sure.

182
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:34,842
- Oh, my God! What happened to the door? 
- So it's noticeable, huh?

183
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:38,780
- Look, is Rachel here? I need to talk to her. 
- didn't you two already talk?

184
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:40,485
Yeah, but...

185
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,718
Okay. Look, you guys know that Rachel and I slept together...

186
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:46,858
...but there's something else.

187
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,125
Rachel's pregnant.

188
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,991
- Holy mother of God! 
- Oh, my God, I can't believe that!

189
00:13:56,101 --> 00:14:00,470
- With my child. 
- That is brand-new information!

190
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:07,644
- You already know, don't you?
- Little bit.

191
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:12,008
- How you doing? 
- Okay. I mean, I'll be okay.

192
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,550
It's just, I don't think I handled it very well.

193
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:16,948
- What'd you say to her? 
- Nothing.

194
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:21,092
But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful.

195
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,456
- Then when I turned around, she was gone. 
- Oh, Ross.

196
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:30,260
I know. But in my defense, 
I just found out that condoms are only, like, 97% effective.

197
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:33,063
- What?
- I gotta go find her.

198
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:36,105
Hey. Hold on! Are you serious?

199
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:39,243
So, like, 3 percent of the time, they don't even work?

200
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:43,271
They should put that on the box!

201
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,943
- Evidently, they do.
- What?!

202
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,287
Well, I'll be.

203
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:05,199
- I can't believe we're here. 
- You've gotta be kidding.

204
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,837
What?

205
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:12,473
As a wedding gift to you, 
the hotel would like to give you the honeymoon suite.

206
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,670
No! You have been screwing us all day!

207
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:20,082
- Who are you? 
- We're you. Just 10 seconds later!

208
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:25,420
You already got the first-class tickets, the lounge. 
We should get free stuff too!

209
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:28,058
You're not the only ones on your honeymoon!

210
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:33,826
You can have the suite if you want. 
We don't care about where we stay.

211
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:36,297
We're here to celebrate our love for each other.

212
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:40,131
We don't have to get free stuff. 
We just want to be together.

213
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:45,107
We need the stuff.

214
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:51,544
Monica, it's Joey. 
Phoebe and I smell gas coming from your apartment.

215
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:56,210
- What? Are you serious? Joey smells gas. 
- What else is new?

216
00:15:56,689 --> 00:16:01,388
- We'd check it out, but you took our keys. 
- Well, do something. Get in there!

217
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:05,859
- How? I guess I could break down your door. 
- Yeah, do that.

218
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:09,159
- And you won't blame us for any damage? 
- No.

219
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:15,540
- Are you doing it? I don't hear anything. 
- Okay, I'll break it down.

220
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:22,610
Hi. He's doing it, he's breaking down the door.

221
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,283
Okay, we're in.

222
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:36,724
- Okay, Rachel, are you comfortable? 
- If I said I was, would you judge me?

223
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:39,360
The doctor'll be here in a minute to do your sonogram.

224
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:40,589
Okay.

225
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:48,333
Oh, man, I swear, if they sold these at Pottery Barn...

226
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:52,167
- Hi.
- Hi.

227
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:53,811
We need to talk.

228
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:58,575
Right now? Because I kind of got an alfresco situation going on over here.

229
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:02,987
Please, I really... 
I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today.

230
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:06,851
- That's fine. Can you stay up near my head? 
- What? Oh, yeah, sorry.

231
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:12,464
I went crazy. I was thinking about myself when I should've been thinking about you...

232
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:14,791
- Okay, head, Ross! Head, Ross! 
- Right.

233
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:19,401
I want you to know that I'm gonna be there through this whole thing. Okay?

234
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:24,541
The doctor's appointments, the Lamaze classes, baby-proofing the apartment.

235
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:27,211
Although, we can worry about that after we get married.

236
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,879
- Married?
- Well, yeah, I think we should get married.

237
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:32,880
Because that's your answer to everything?

238
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:37,683
No. Because that's the right thing to do.

239
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:43,192
Yeah, maybe, if you're in love. But Ross, we are not in love, are we?

240
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:48,799
No. But still, I mean, you can't possibly do this alone.

241
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,496
Excuse me?

242
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:55,935
- You can't even eat alone in a restaurant. 
- What?

243
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:59,872
If you can't eat by yourself, how do you expect to have a baby by yourself?

244
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:03,481
- I can too eat by myself ! 
- When have you ever?

245
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:08,085
When certain people leave the table and I am not finished!

246
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:11,586
Well, certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!

247
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,951
Oh, please. You inale your food.

248
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:17,960
I grew up with Monica. 
If you didn't eat fast, you didn't eat!

249
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,527
Am I interrupting?

250
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:26,226
No, Dr. Long. Please come in. 
This is Ross. He is the father.

251
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,771
But not the husband, because, evidently, she can do this alone.

252
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:33,906
Nice to meet you. I'll get started on this.

253
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:40,779
- Why you can't admit you need me? 
- I need you to stay near my head!

254
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:47,484
Okay. Everything looks good. 
Here it is on the screen.

255
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:50,384
Here's your uterus...

256
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:54,497
...and right here is your baby.

257
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,899
Oh, my God.

258
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:04,137
There it is. I see it.

259
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:07,608
Congratulations. I'll give you two a minute.

260
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,940
- Okay.
- Thank you.

261
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:19,148
Pretty amazing, huh?

262
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,719
I don't see it!

263
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:33,334
- What?
- I can't see it.

264
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,739
But you just said that you did.

265
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:39,308
I know. I lied. 
I didn't want her to think I was a terrible mother.

266
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,206
I can't even see my own baby!

267
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:47,113
Oh, sure. Come here. Sure, you can. 
Come here. Look, it's right there.

268
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,721
Oh, it's beautiful.

269
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:57,461
I see it now.

270
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,898
- Do you really?
- No, I don't see it!

271
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,068
Okay. Come on. All right. Okay.

272
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:10,435
You see this tiny thing that looks like a peanut?

273
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:12,136
Yeah.

274
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,740
Sweetie, that's it.

275
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,838
That's it?

276
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,407
Well, I saw that.

277
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,555
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

278
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:35,196
Wow, I can't believe that's our baby.

279
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:40,763
Yeah, that's our baby.

280
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,470
Well, they put up the new door.

281
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,546
- So it's all locked up and secure? 
- Yeah. Why?

282
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:57,012
I was trying to figure out how bad I want one of Monica's turkey pot pies.

283
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,225
- Hi.
- Hey.

284
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:03,485
- So how was the doctor? 
- Everything went great.

285
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:07,028
- Good. 
- Hey, show them the picture of your uterus.

286
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:14,566
I don't see the baby. Where is it?

287
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:18,402
Oh, no, I know. 
I couldn't see it either at first. 
But it's right...

288
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:22,004
Ross, I lost it again.


288
0:21:25,004 --> 0:21:28,004
The following scenes were deleted

288
0:21:28,004 --> 0:21:31,004
from the episode "THE ONE WHERE RACHEL TELLS ROSS"

288
0:21:31,004 --> 0:21:35,004
and are being presented here for the first time

288
0:21:35.15 --> 0:21:38.90
The story involved Chandler joking with security at an airport

288
0:21:38.92 --> 0:21:42.50
and was to air two weeks after the events of Sep.11, 2001

288
0:21:42.92 --> 0:21:46.75
In light of this, we decided to replace the original story

288
0:21:46.80 --> 0:21:51.19
As part of the history of the show,

288
0:21:51.20 --> 0:21:53.25
we hope that the scenes can now be viewed

288
0:21:53.30 --> 0:21:56.25
in the spirit which they were originally intended


289
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:04,117
No problem getting a cab. Notraffic.

290
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:08,319
My way totally works. I feel totally relaxed and calm.

291
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:09,417
Go, go, go!

292
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:14,789
Let's see, you're on the flight to Nassau.

293
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:19,701
Mr. Bing, you'll be in 25J. 
Mrs. Bing, you'll be in 25K.

294
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:21,898
Mrs. Bing. It is a funny name.

295
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:28,401
She's not laughing at the name.
We just got married. We're going on our honeymoon.

296
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,108
Really? Congratulations.

297
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,845
You know what, let me see what I can do.

298
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:38,584
There was a cancelation, I can bump you into first class.

299
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:39,885
Thanks.

300
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:43,894
We were here any earlier, those seats may have been gone 

301
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:45,930
Compromise works.

302
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:51,196
My name is "Mrs. Bing." Haven't I compromised enough

303
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,373
Could you hurry up?

304
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:02,971
I have never set one of these off, and I won't start now.

305
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:10,215
My anklet. That was a close one.

306
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:19,122
Hey Hey, look at that 
Federal law prohibits any joking regarding aircraft highjacking or bombing

307
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:23,190
You don't have to worry about me, man. I take my bombs very seriously.

308
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:27,068
Sir, come with us. No, wait! Chandler!

309
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,471
That doesn't count. Backwards doesn't count!

310
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:39,414
This is ridiculous. I was just making a joke.

311
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:45,150
I mean I know the sign says, "No jokes about bombs"
but shouldn't the sign really say,"No bombs"?

312
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:50,923
I mean isn't that the guy we really have to worry about here
the guy with the bombs, not the guy who jokes about his bombs

313
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:54,227
not that I have bombs, because if I did, I probably wouldn't joke about it.

314
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:57,200
I'd probably wanna keep that rather quiet.

315
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:01,137
I'm sorry, you had some questions for me?

316
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:03,071
Miss, what is your association with this man?

317
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:05,302
- He's my husband. 
- I see.

318
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:09,040
Oh, but only for a few days.I mean I don't know what he does when he's outside the house

319
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,079
Thanks, darling.

320
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:17,588
You see, this is the first time we're traveling my way
so it's very important that we make this flight

321
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:20,523
See it's one of those her plan versus my plan, kind of things

322
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:23,925
What do you mean by "plan"?

323
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:28,261
You really should just ask me yes or no questions.

324
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:30,665
Oh no, That's not his bag, that's my bag.

325
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:35,502
It's just procedure. Yes but, you don't understand, see everything is packed perfectly.

326
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:41,535
It took me forever to do this. OK, there are like over 50 folded pieces

327
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:43,080
You're mean.

328
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,116
All right, you're free to go.Thank you, thanks.

329
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:54,090
And listen about those speedos, I don't know how they got in there

330
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:03,630
- Hello
- Hey, it's Joey. Listen, Phoebe and I smell gas coming from your apartment.

331
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,192
What? Are you serious?

332
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:09,036
Joey smells gas. What else is new?

333
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:12,907
-And we go check it out, but you took away our keys.
-Well, do something!

334
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:16,004
-You want us to break down your door?
-Yes!

335
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:19,744
- And you won't blame us for any damage?
- No!

336
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:22,787
OK then, you sure you wanna us do this?

337
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:26,984
No, I want you to stand there and wait for the whole place to blow up.

338
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:28,753
Step back inside, please.
