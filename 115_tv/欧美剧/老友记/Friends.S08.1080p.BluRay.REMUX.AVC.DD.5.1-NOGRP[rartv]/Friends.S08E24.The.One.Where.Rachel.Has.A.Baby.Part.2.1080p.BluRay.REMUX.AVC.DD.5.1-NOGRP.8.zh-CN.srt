1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,600
Previously on Friends:

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,840
I've been at this for 17 hours.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,120
- How many centimeters am I dilated?
- Three.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,600
Just three? I'm dilated three!

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,840
- We talk about having babies someday.
- We're gonna try?

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,240
- Right here?
- No, not here.

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,520
Maybe here.

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,240
Your grandma's engagement ring,
I want you to give it to Rachel.

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,560
- Mom, no.
- This isn't some girl...

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,760
...you picked up in a bar
and humped.

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,200
I take it you're just visiting someone?

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,520
- Wanna visit someone else?
- I would like that.

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,600
- That's him.
- Great. Go get him!

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,480
Maybe you could go in first.

15
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,320
I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray.
I have a few routine questions.

16
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,920
Do you sleep with women
and never call them again?

17
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,240
Oh, my God!

18
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,720
Should we tell Rachel there's an empty
room right next to hers?

19
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,880
We could. Or we could have sex in it.

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,880
Well, let me think about that.
While I remove my pants!

21
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,080
Okay, mister! Fertilize me!

22
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,520
Does that sound like Janice?

23
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,520
If it's not, then there's two of them.

24
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,280
And that would mean
it's the end of the world!

25
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,960
The One Where Rachel has a Baby - Part II

26
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,760
Hey.

27
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,920
- Hey.
- Hi.

28
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,160
I can't believe this is taking so long.
How are you?

29
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:32,160
Not bad. You know that feeling, trying
to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?

30
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,160
Weirdest thing. Did I hear...?

31
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,720
Mother of God, it's true!

32
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,040
Chandler Bing!

33
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,200
Janice.

34
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,840
Not just Janice. Janice in labor.
Contracting and everything.

35
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,480
Oh, this should be easy.
I have a very wide pelvis.

36
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,000
You remember, Chandler.

37
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,400
I didn't know you were pregnant.

38
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,200
Who's the unwitting human
whose essence you've stolen?

39
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,520
It's you.

40
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,920
This is yours.

41
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,680
What?

42
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,720
Look how nervous he gets!
We haven't slept together in years!

43
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,560
That's funny. Does it hurt?
Does the labor hurt?

44
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,880
Okay, I have one.
If you had to, which would you eat?

45
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,280
A Seeing Eye dog or a talking gorilla?

46
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,760
I'd have to say the talking gorilla.

47
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,520
'Cause at least I could explain to him
that you're making me eat him.

48
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,480
- Oh. Somebody went to college.
- Yeah.

49
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,800
Wow. What is it? I'm sorry.

50
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,840
I'm sorry. My foot itches like crazy.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,680
Oh. I'll get it.

52
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,520
I usually get to know a girl better
before I let her spoon me.

53
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,840
Relax. It's not like we're forking.

54
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,360
Oh, that's five, Ross.
Five women have had five babies...

55
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,880
...and I have had no babies.

56
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,760
Why doesn't she want to come out?

57
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,800
I think you made such a nice
home for her...

58
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,080
...the last nine months,
that she just doesn't want to leave.

59
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:36,000
Oh, look at you making up crap for me.

60
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,120
- Oh, God.
- Okay. Okay.

61
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,800
Twenty-one hours. You're a hero.

62
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,200
Do something! Get me drugs...

63
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,240
...or you light a fire up in there
and just smoke it out!

64
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,000
I think you're ready to go
to the delivery room.

65
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,160
What?

66
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,520
Ten centimeters.
You're about to become a mom.

67
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,080
Oh, my God. Okay.

68
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,480
Beat you, sucker! Oh, baby.

69
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:18,040
Oh, my God! That's the doctor
who was in my room before.

70
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:23,240
Oh. Okay, Mr. Percocet.

71
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,840
I'm telling you, the guy
from that show was here...

72
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,880
...asking me all these weird questions.

73
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,080
Do you really believe that a character
from a TV show was here?

74
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,640
Rachel's having her baby!

75
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,920
That's him! You know him?

76
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,040
Okay. Okay. I... Okay.

77
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,080
I sent my friend, Joey,
in here to find out stuff about you.

78
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,040
If it, you know, if it helps,
you came off great.

79
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,760
A lot better than I'm coming off
right now.

80
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,880
I don't believe this. You had him
pretend he was a fake doctor?

81
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,520
Fake? Excuse me? Hello?

82
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:12,200
- You tried making me think I was crazy?
- That was wrong. I'm so sorry.

83
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,480
It's just that I liked you so much.
Can we just start over?

84
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,800
I don't think so.

85
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,760
If I may? You told me a lot
of personal stuff about you, right?

86
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,760
Now, maybe it would help if you knew
some personal stuff about her.

87
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,200
She was married to a gay ice dancer.

88
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,640
She gave birth to her
brother's triplets.

89
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,520
Her twin sister used to do porn.

90
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,640
- We're trying to dial down the crazy.
- Right.

91
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,080
We don't know each other,
so it'd be easy to forget this...

92
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,240
...but there's something between us.
I don't know about you...

93
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,960
...but that doesn't happen to me a lot.

94
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,680
- It doesn't happen to me, either.
- Me, neither!

95
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,040
Push. Push. We're gonna push
for five more seconds.

96
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,880
Five, four...

97
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,280
Three, two, one! Oh!

98
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,160
The next contraction will be
in 20 seconds.

99
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,120
- I can't push anymore!
- You're doing great.

100
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,360
Oh, God! Twenty seconds, my ass!

101
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,800
Here we go. Okay, keep pushing.

102
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,760
- Come on.
- Push. Wait.

103
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,440
- I see something.
- What, you do? You do? Oh, my God!

104
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,640
- Don't say "Oh, my God!" What?!
- What is that?

105
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,240
The baby's buttocks. She's breech.

106
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,440
- I thought she had two heads.
- Oh, God!

107
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,800
Will she be okay?

108
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,360
- She'll be fine.
- Yeah.

109
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,600
She's in a difficult position,
so push hard.

110
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,040
- Okay.
- Go. Come on. Go! Go!

111
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,040
You'll have to push harder.

112
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,600
- I'm sorry, I can't! I can't!
- Yes, you can. I know you can do this.

113
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,960
I can't do it.
Please, you do it for me!

114
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:10,440
Let's go. One more time.
One final push. Ready? One, two, three.

115
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,760
Good.

116
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,480
Keep pushing!

117
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,040
Are you okay?

118
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,640
You have no idea how much this hurts.

119
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,720
Keep going! Keep going!

120
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,200
Here we go!

121
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,280
She's upside down, but she's coming!

122
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,000
- Oh, God!
- Oh! Oh, my God!

123
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,000
Oh, my God, she's here.

124
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,880
Oh, she's perfect.

125
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,880
Oh, wow! Oh, she's so tiny.

126
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,840
- Where'd she go?
- They're just wrapping her up.

127
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,080
Okay. Well, be careful with her,
she's really tiny.

128
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,760
Here she is.

129
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,640
Oh, thanks for coming out of me.

130
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,480
I know. Oh.

131
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,880
She's looking at me. Hi. I know you.

132
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,480
- Do we have a name yet?
- No, not yet.

133
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,080
Fine. For now we'll just
call her Baby Girl Greene.

134
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,760
Oh, no. Baby Girl Geller-Greene.

135
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,880
Hello, Baby Girl.

136
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,520
- Can we come in?
- Oh, come on in.

137
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,280
- Oh, there she is.
- Oh, she's so beautiful.

138
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,920
Here.

139
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,000
Oh, my God. She's amazing.

140
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,960
Oh, I'm so glad you guys got drunk
and had sex.

141
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,520
It's incredible. I mean,
one minute she's inside you...

142
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,760
...and then 47 hours later,
here she is.

143
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,760
She looks so real.

144
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,040
You know what I mean.

145
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,520
- Okay, my turn. My turn.
- Aunt Phoebe.

146
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,560
Oh, baby. Oh, you're so cute!

147
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,640
Oh, I could squeeze your little head.

148
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,120
I won't.

149
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:04,080
- Honey, what's the matter?
- Nothing. I just can't stop crying.

150
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,960
The doctor said it's normal,
plus you're sleep-deprived.

151
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,200
You guys are all sleep-deprived.

152
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:15,240
I don't see you weeping because you
put your slippers on the wrong feet.

153
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,240
Oh, God.

154
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,840
- What's the matter now?
- I was reliving it.

155
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,680
Do you know what you're gonna
call her yet?

156
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,920
Wait, it's not gonna be Baby Girl?
I thought that was so original.

157
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,440
Actually, we've narrowed it
down to two.

158
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:40,320
And you know what? I love them both.
So just pick one, and that'll be it.

159
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,000
Wow, okay. Everyone?

160
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,080
This is Isabella.

161
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,000
- Hi, Isabella!
- Hi.

162
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,640
What?

163
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,520
That's not her name.

164
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,040
I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel
like an Isabella.

165
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,560
- What was the other one?
- Delilah.

166
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,360
Oh, great! At least she
sounds like a biblical whore.

167
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,720
So, I guess we're back to Baby Girl.

168
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,480
What will we do?

169
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,280
- You'll find a name.
- Easy for you to say.

170
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,160
You know what your
kids' names will be.

171
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,560
- You do?
- I had them picked out since I was 14.

172
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,520
Oh, no, it's gonna be named after
some snack or baked good, isn't it?

173
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:43,520
- Well, tell us, what are they?
- Okay. If it's a boy, it's Daniel.

174
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,960
- And if it's a girl?
- I don't want to say.

175
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,040
Oh, stop. Tell us.
We're not gonna want it.

176
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,600
Okay. It's Emma.

177
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,720
Emma.

178
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,240
See, I don't want it.

179
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,360
- Take it.
- What?

180
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,520
She's clearly an Emma.

181
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,880
Oh, honey, but you love that name.

182
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,480
Yeah. But I love you more.

183
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,600
Besides, nothing goes with Bing.
So I'm screwed.

184
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:36,440
Aaron Lipman-Guralnick would like
to say hello to his future bride.

185
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,680
Oh.

186
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,960
Wow, he kind of takes your breath away,
doesn't he?

187
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,760
He's a keeper.

188
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,680
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, I'm fine.

189
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:02,440
I really admire what you're doing.
Just raising her all alone.

190
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,120
I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.

191
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:10,560
Sure. Now. But what happens when he
meets somebody else and gets married?

192
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,840
Well, then he gets a divorce.
It's Ross.

193
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,760
I'm telling you. Listen to Janice.

194
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:25,840
They all say they're gonna be there,
until they start their real family.

195
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,280
- That's never gonna happen with Ross.
- That's what I thought.

196
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,520
I'm lucky if my kid gets to spend
a weekend with her father...

197
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,960
...and little Miss New Boobs.

198
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,800
Really?

199
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,480
I hate to be the one to say it...

200
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,480
...but, honey, you two are on your own.

201
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,360
Well, that's, you know, that's...

202
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,640
We've been alone for the last
20 minutes and we're doing okay.

203
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,440
Maybe we won't be alone.

204
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,360
Because lately things have been
happening between me and Ross.

205
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:08,080
And right before I went into labor,
we had this kiss. You know?

206
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,920
So it might be the beginning
of something.

207
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,120
- Hey, Janice.
- Oh, hi.

208
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,560
Who's this little guy?

209
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,960
- Aaron, your future son-in-law.
- Oh, no, no.

210
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,560
- I'm gonna leave you three alone.
- Okay.

211
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,160
Man, you see the kid on that nose?

212
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,080
You know what I was thinking about?

213
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:48,000
That kiss before we left the apartment.
That was something, huh?

214
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,960
Yeah. Yeah, it really was.

215
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,760
But we, we gotta be careful.

216
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,160
We... You know, we can't let
that happen again, you know?

217
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,560
Right.

218
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:09,040
- We don't want to go down that road.
- No. That's why I brought it up.

219
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,080
- They didn't have any sodas?
- Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

220
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,160
I was talking to this nurse.
Completely forgot.

221
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,600
And so it begins.

222
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,000
She in there?

223
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,520
Yeah. She's putting her down now.
That's her.

224
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,280
- Look at Emma.
- I can't decide who she looks like.

225
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,680
Oh, what, are you kidding?
She's gorgeous! It's all Rachel.

226
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:53,520
I'm sorry. For the last time,
why aren't you two together again?

227
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,480
No, I know.
Because you're not in that place.

228
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,720
Which would be fine,
except you totally are.

229
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,440
It's complicated, okay?

230
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:09,400
You love her, you always have,
you have a child together.

231
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,880
There's no right answer.

232
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,080
Look, we've been together.
Then apart. Then together, then apart.

233
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,120
And now we have a baby.

234
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:27,960
It's just, if we got together again
and it didn't work out?

235
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,560
I could never do that to Emma.

236
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:38,760
I mean, she came into this world
thinking everything... Now me.

237
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,520
What, do they put something
in the water here?

238
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,480
It's just, Rachel and I,
we're doing really well now.

239
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,320
I know. If you try to make it more,
you might wreck it.

240
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,280
- Yeah, exactly.
- Right.

241
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,880
Or you might get everything
you've wanted since you were 15.

242
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,120
Hey.

243
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,720
I saw a woman breastfeeding
twins at the same time.

244
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,520
It is like a freak show up here.

245
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,000
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

246
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,760
What is it? Hey?

247
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:24,080
- Really, it's nothing. I'm...
- Rach, come on. What?

248
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,680
I've just been thinking about how
my baby and I are gonna be all alone.

249
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,800
What are you talking about?
What about Ross?

250
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,960
Please. He'll be with his real family.
The twins and little Miss New Boobs.

251
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,160
Okay, how long
was I watching that woman?

252
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,280
I'm just saying that, you know...

253
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,480
...someday Ross is gonna
meet somebody...

254
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,400
...and he's gonna have his own life.

255
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,840
Right?

256
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,720
Yeah, I guess so.

257
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,800
I just never thought I'd be raising
this baby all by myself.

258
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,640
That's pretty dumb, huh?

259
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,840
Hey, you listen to me. Listen to me.

260
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You are never, ever gonna be alone.

261
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,720
Okay? I promise I
won't let that happen.

262
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:23,320
Joey. Oh, sweetie,
what would I do without you?

263
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,920
You don't have to worry about that,
okay?

264
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,360
Could you grab me my other box
of tissues?

265
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,000
- They're under Ross' coat.
- Sure.

266
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,000
Oh, my God!

267
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,400
Joey?

268
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,840
Oh, my God.

269
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,920
Okay.

270
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,080
- That was amazing.
- I know.

271
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:45,560
Hey, do you realize that we may have
just changed our lives forever?

272
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,880
We may have started our family.
In nine months we could be here...

273
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,200
...having our own baby.

274
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,720
And if not, we got to do it
on a bucket.
