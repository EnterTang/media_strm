1
00:00:02,867 --> 00:00:05,235
-Hey. I got some bad news.
-What?

2
00:00:05,469 --> 00:00:10,707
That's no way to seII newspapers.
Try, ''Extra! Extra! Read aII about it!''

3
00:00:11,108 --> 00:00:15,112
No. Monica's restaurant got a horribIe
review in the Post.

4
00:00:16,648 --> 00:00:21,753
I didn't want her to see it, so I ran
around and bought aII the copies.

5
00:00:22,354 --> 00:00:25,591
Two, four, six, one miIIion.
Yeah, you got them aII.

6
00:00:26,492 --> 00:00:30,196
This is bad.
And I've had bad reviews.

7
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:32,432
I remember my first good one:

8
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:35,635
''Everything eIse in Our Town
was terribIe.

9
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:38,805
Joey Tribbiani was abysmaI.''

10
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:45,146
Oh, my God!
Look at aII the newspapers.

11
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:49,317
It must be a good review. Is it great?

12
00:00:53,455 --> 00:00:54,656
Oh, dear God.

13
00:00:54,889 --> 00:01:00,294
But the good news is, no one
in a two-bIock radius wiII ever know.

14
00:01:00,462 --> 00:01:03,665
-And the rest of Manhattan?
-They aII know.

15
00:01:04,467 --> 00:01:08,638
Oh, my God, this is horribIe.
I'm so humiIiated.

16
00:01:08,872 --> 00:01:12,408
They say there's no such thing
as bad press.

17
00:01:12,643 --> 00:01:18,081
You don't think that ''the mahi-mahi
was awfuI-awfuI'' is bad press?

18
00:01:20,017 --> 00:01:21,986
I didn't write it.

19
00:01:22,553 --> 00:01:26,089
-God, is he right? Am I awfuI?
-Oh, no!

20
00:01:26,358 --> 00:01:27,892
Monica, Iisten to me.

21
00:01:28,092 --> 00:01:31,428
I'm not just saying this
because I'm your friend.

22
00:01:31,596 --> 00:01:34,832
Your food is abysmaI!

23
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:20,282
-Ross?
-What? What?

24
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:24,086
-I am freaking out!
-Are you?

25
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:26,789
My due date is in one week!

26
00:02:27,024 --> 00:02:29,960
-What are you doing up?
-That is seven days.

27
00:02:30,127 --> 00:02:33,263
I had a Iot of water.
Can we do this after--?

28
00:02:33,497 --> 00:02:35,232
No, no, no, no, Ross!

29
00:02:35,433 --> 00:02:38,101
We don't have any big stuff we need.

30
00:02:38,302 --> 00:02:41,639
We don't have a changing tabIe or a crib.

31
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,645
-We do not have a diaper service.
-Funny you shouId mention diapers.

32
00:02:47,179 --> 00:02:51,050
-I'm serious.
-There's nothing to worry about.

33
00:02:51,216 --> 00:02:55,220
There's a baby store on West 1 0th.
We'II go there...

34
00:02:55,421 --> 00:03:00,026
-...and get everything we need. Okay?
-Okay. Thank you. That's great.

35
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,263
Where on West 1 0th?
There's a shoe store--

36
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:08,134
Okay. If you're gonna do this,
then I'm gonna go do that, so....

37
00:03:08,635 --> 00:03:12,005
-Wait, Ross! I'm sorry, one more thing.
-Yeah.

38
00:03:12,206 --> 00:03:16,243
Our situation, you know,
what we mean to each other...

39
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:21,949
...and, I mean, we're having this baby
together and we Iive together....

40
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,553
Isn't that--? Isn't that weird?

41
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,228
WeII....

42
00:03:32,528 --> 00:03:35,263
I'm just kidding. You can go pee.

43
00:03:39,603 --> 00:03:43,307
Did we say we were gonna meet here
or at the movie?

44
00:03:43,573 --> 00:03:46,976
-We said at the movies, but--
-I'II see you there.

45
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:51,949
-Now that you're here...?
-I'II hang out tiII I have to meet you.

46
00:03:52,283 --> 00:03:55,954
-How come you're not going?
-I've got a job interview.

47
00:03:56,187 --> 00:04:01,159
-I thought you aIready have a job.
-And they say you don't pay attention.

48
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,264
It's a better job.
It's vice president of the company...

49
00:04:05,431 --> 00:04:09,368
...that does data reconfiguration
for other companies.

50
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,608
-Wow. How do you know how to do that?
-That's what I do now.

51
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,012
-Joey? Come taste this.
-What?

52
00:04:19,212 --> 00:04:22,682
Remember the guy that gave me
a bad review? WeII....

53
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:25,886
I'm getting my revenge.

54
00:04:26,254 --> 00:04:28,322
You cooked him?

55
00:04:28,757 --> 00:04:32,360
No. He teaches a course
at The New SchooI....

56
00:04:32,627 --> 00:04:35,897
I want to make him try
my bouiIIabaisse again.

57
00:04:36,165 --> 00:04:39,368
I can't wait to read the front
page tomorrow:

58
00:04:39,601 --> 00:04:44,339
''Restaurant reviewer admits:
'I was wrong about Monica.'''

59
00:04:44,707 --> 00:04:46,609
The front page?

60
00:04:46,776 --> 00:04:50,546
You reaIIy do Iive in your own
IittIe worId, don't you?

61
00:04:51,481 --> 00:04:55,084
-I better get to my movie.
-Oh, yeah.

62
00:04:55,286 --> 00:04:58,222
If I'm going to the movie
and you're going to the movie...

63
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:00,491
...why don't we just go together?

64
00:05:01,192 --> 00:05:03,927
How's that for data reconfiguration,
huh, Chand?

65
00:05:11,403 --> 00:05:13,805
My name's Katie if there's
anything eIse you need.

66
00:05:13,972 --> 00:05:17,710
Oh, God, I don't know. I want-- Everything
is so great, I just want everything.

67
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,779
Oh, Iook at this. We need this!

68
00:05:20,947 --> 00:05:22,648
-What is it?
-I don't know.

69
00:05:24,684 --> 00:05:27,320
Have you ever had two peopIe
who weren't wearing crowns...

70
00:05:27,521 --> 00:05:28,888
...spend this much money here?

71
00:05:29,055 --> 00:05:31,657
You have seIected a Iot of nice things.

72
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:34,961
You want these deIivered,
Mr. and Mrs. GeIIer?

73
00:05:35,162 --> 00:05:37,197
-Oh, no, no.
-No, no.

74
00:05:37,465 --> 00:05:40,301
-We're not married.
-We are having a baby...

75
00:05:40,568 --> 00:05:42,537
...but we're not invoIved.

76
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,974
I mean, we were seeing
each other a whiIe ago...

77
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:52,447
...but then we were just friends, and
then there was one drunken night....

78
00:05:54,616 --> 00:05:58,554
Or, yes, stranger,
we'd Iike this deIivered, pIease.

79
00:05:58,721 --> 00:06:01,891
-Can you fiII out this address card?
-Oh, okay.

80
00:06:02,525 --> 00:06:05,462
-You picked out a Iot of dinosaurs.
-Yeah.

81
00:06:05,662 --> 00:06:09,366
That's one of the reasons
why we're not a coupIe.

82
00:06:09,633 --> 00:06:12,202
I chose those. I'm a paIeontoIogist.

83
00:06:12,403 --> 00:06:14,772
ReaIIy? That is so cooI.

84
00:06:15,006 --> 00:06:20,612
Don't get too worked up. It sounds
Iike he's a doctor, but he's not.

85
00:06:20,845 --> 00:06:23,314
No. I'm fascinated by paIeontoIogy.

86
00:06:23,515 --> 00:06:27,619
-Have you read the WaIter AIvarez book?
-I teach it in cIass.

87
00:06:27,853 --> 00:06:33,225
Standing at a cash register, I'm
hoIding a credit card, and I'm bored.

88
00:06:33,859 --> 00:06:38,197
I Iove your neighborhood.
There's a great gym around the corner.

89
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:42,302
-That's my gym.
-I couId teII you work out.

90
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:51,879
A paIeontoIogist who works out.
You're Iike Indiana Jones.

91
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,085
I am Iike Indiana Jones.

92
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,797
-Hi, Pheebs.
-Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?

93
00:07:08,997 --> 00:07:11,566
Great! We got everything we needed.

94
00:07:11,768 --> 00:07:15,872
Oh, and Ross aImost got
something that wasn't on the Iist.

95
00:07:16,072 --> 00:07:18,207
A whore.

96
00:07:18,508 --> 00:07:19,709
What?

97
00:07:20,244 --> 00:07:25,049
We were paying, and this saIes
woman just started fIirting with him.

98
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:26,716
Can you beIieve that?

99
00:07:26,951 --> 00:07:31,121
-Did she know you two weren't married?
-Yeah.

100
00:07:31,322 --> 00:07:36,561
Oh, my God. WeII, the idea--
A woman fIirting with a singIe man?

101
00:07:36,762 --> 00:07:39,731
-We must aIert the church eIders.
-No.

102
00:07:40,566 --> 00:07:44,403
You don't understand.
You didn't see how brazen she was.

103
00:07:45,071 --> 00:07:47,940
-Sounds Iike you're jeaIous.
-No, I'm not.

104
00:07:48,107 --> 00:07:52,178
I just think it's wrong.
I mean, here I am, about to pop...

105
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:56,783
...and he's out picking up
some shopgirI at SIuts-R-Us?

106
00:07:57,985 --> 00:08:00,453
Is that a reaI pIace?

107
00:08:00,754 --> 00:08:03,223
Are they hiring?

108
00:08:04,325 --> 00:08:07,395
Hey, Phoebe. Fatty.

109
00:08:08,797 --> 00:08:10,364
Why so fancy?

110
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:12,300
I got a job interview.

111
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:16,405
It's more money, and I'd be doing
data reconfiguration.

112
00:08:16,605 --> 00:08:21,576
-I think I know someone who does that.
-Me. I do that.

113
00:08:22,011 --> 00:08:24,446
So do I Iook okay?
I'm nervous.

114
00:08:24,647 --> 00:08:26,616
Oh, yeah. You Iook great.

115
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,086
You know, just don't
get your hopes up.

116
00:08:30,754 --> 00:08:33,156
-Why not?
-WeII, the interview.

117
00:08:33,357 --> 00:08:34,791
-Yeah?
-You know.

118
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,294
You don't make a very good
first impression.

119
00:08:38,662 --> 00:08:41,665
-What?
-Oh, you don't know.

120
00:08:42,466 --> 00:08:46,770
-Are you serious?
-When I first met you, you were Iike:

121
00:08:46,971 --> 00:08:50,074
I was Iike:

122
00:08:52,811 --> 00:08:54,579
What is it that I do?

123
00:08:54,813 --> 00:08:58,517
It's just, Iike, you're trying too hard,
making jokes....

124
00:08:58,751 --> 00:09:00,986
You come off a IittIe needy.

125
00:09:01,187 --> 00:09:03,656
Did you Iike me when we first met?

126
00:09:04,023 --> 00:09:09,896
ChandIer, I'm not gonna Iie to you.
But I am gonna run away from you.

127
00:09:13,433 --> 00:09:15,602
She's put on so much weight.

128
00:09:21,109 --> 00:09:22,910
There he is.

129
00:09:23,111 --> 00:09:25,346
That smug bastard.

130
00:09:26,114 --> 00:09:28,083
Okay, cIass.
We'II see you next time.

131
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,853
There he is.

132
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:38,327
Hi. I'm Monica GeIIer,
chef at AIIessandro's.

133
00:09:38,728 --> 00:09:40,597
StiII?

134
00:09:40,763 --> 00:09:42,999
The things you said were unfair...

135
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:46,569
...and I want you to try
my bouiIIabaisse again.

136
00:09:46,737 --> 00:09:49,707
I don't see why I'd do
that to myseIf again.

137
00:09:49,907 --> 00:09:52,843
Either eat it or be in it.

138
00:09:53,544 --> 00:09:55,679
Spoon?

139
00:10:00,018 --> 00:10:02,553
-What do you think?
-I'm torn...

140
00:10:02,754 --> 00:10:07,559
...between my integrity
and my desire to avoid a beating.

141
00:10:07,727 --> 00:10:13,165
But I must be honest.
Your soup is abysmaI.

142
00:10:14,334 --> 00:10:19,772
ThattagirI! We shouId get out of here,
there's a new cIass coming in.

143
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,608
WeIcome to Introduction to Cooking.

144
00:10:22,809 --> 00:10:27,914
Can anyone teII me the difference
between hoIIandaise and béarnaise sauce?

145
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,285
-I can.
-Okay, go ahead.

146
00:10:31,553 --> 00:10:35,122
WeII, they both have a egg yoIk
and butter base.

147
00:10:35,323 --> 00:10:40,162
But a béarnaise has shaIIots,
cherviI, and most importantIy, tarragon.

148
00:10:40,628 --> 00:10:43,097
Very good. What's your name?

149
00:10:43,298 --> 00:10:47,269
-You go to the head of the cIass!
-Okay!

150
00:10:50,173 --> 00:10:52,641
This stuff takes up a Iot of room.

151
00:10:52,942 --> 00:10:56,445
How serious are you about keeping
Ben in your Iife?

152
00:10:57,146 --> 00:11:00,449
My son? Pretty serious.

153
00:11:06,824 --> 00:11:09,293
Hi, Katie.
What are you doing here?

154
00:11:09,494 --> 00:11:12,263
The deIivery went out
and they forgot this.

155
00:11:12,497 --> 00:11:18,103
It must have been obvious, since it
was the onIy thing Ieft in your store.

156
00:11:18,337 --> 00:11:24,343
Listen, to be honest, home deIiveries
aren't reaIIy part of my job description.

157
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:31,584
Oh, I actuaIIy came here
to ask you out.

158
00:11:31,884 --> 00:11:36,155
Oh. Wow.
Yeah, that sounds great.

159
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:42,795
I'm just gonna put this back in my
pocket and pretend that didn't happen.

160
00:11:42,996 --> 00:11:45,565
I'm free now.
You want to get coffee--?

161
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,471
-Sure.
-Horny bitch.

162
00:11:52,274 --> 00:11:56,478
No, you're a horny bitch!
No, you're a horny bitch!

163
00:11:56,678 --> 00:11:59,514
No, you're a horny bitch!

164
00:11:59,682 --> 00:12:01,817
You guys have a good time.

165
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:05,654
I'm just gonna grab my coat.
And my whip.

166
00:12:07,123 --> 00:12:10,426
You know, because of Indiana Jones.

167
00:12:12,128 --> 00:12:15,866
Not because I'm into S & M.

168
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,970
I'm not into anything weird, you know?

169
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,305
Just normaI sex.

170
00:12:24,676 --> 00:12:27,278
So I'm gonna grab my coat.

171
00:12:31,249 --> 00:12:37,222
So you had a good day, huh?
Big commission, picked up a daddy.

172
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,259
Are you okay with this?

173
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:44,029
Oh, yeah. Yeah, pIease.
You guys have fun.

174
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,564
-Okay.
-Yeah.

175
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:46,933
Nice to see you.

176
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:51,570
Oh, and it was great to see you too.
And you Iook fantastic.

177
00:12:51,806 --> 00:12:55,776
-AIthough you missed a button.
-Oh, actuaIIy, I....

178
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:58,678
Oh, okay, I see
what you're doing there.

179
00:13:01,883 --> 00:13:05,787
I can't even beIieve this.
I reaIIy come off that badIy?

180
00:13:05,954 --> 00:13:08,724
It's okay. You caIm down
after a whiIe...

181
00:13:08,924 --> 00:13:12,227
...and then peopIe see
how wonderfuI you are.

182
00:13:12,494 --> 00:13:16,165
Good. Because I'm sure this
interview wiII Iast weeks.

183
00:13:16,398 --> 00:13:20,702
AII right, don't freak out, okay?
I wiII heIp you.

184
00:13:20,903 --> 00:13:24,574
-How Iong before you have to Ieave?
-An hour.

185
00:13:24,808 --> 00:13:27,344
-I can't heIp you.
-Phoebe--

186
00:13:27,578 --> 00:13:33,016
We'II do our best. I'm the interviewer
and I'm meeting you for the first time.

187
00:13:33,251 --> 00:13:37,288
-Okay.
-Hi. Come on in. I'm Regina PhaIanges.

188
00:13:38,456 --> 00:13:40,358
-ChandIer Bing.
-Oh, Bing.

189
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,296
-What an unusuaI name.
-You shouId meet my UncIe Bada.

190
00:13:50,536 --> 00:13:53,105
I'II Iet myseIf out.

191
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:02,482
Your aIfredo's dry.
Did you use your cheese?

192
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:07,854
When you say ''use,'' do you mean
''eat as a pre-cooking snack''?

193
00:14:08,555 --> 00:14:11,792
-And the cream?
-Cheese makes me thirsty.

194
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:17,131
-Okay. Let's move on.
-AII right.

195
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,137
Something smeIIs good
over at Monica's station.

196
00:14:23,171 --> 00:14:27,109
My God! This is amazing!
You've never made this before?

197
00:14:27,343 --> 00:14:31,014
Oh, no. I don't know anything
about cooking.

198
00:14:31,247 --> 00:14:36,119
I had to ask what it was caIIed when
the water makes those bubbIes.

199
00:14:36,886 --> 00:14:41,324
-Hats off to the chef.
-Your mouth was fuII. I didn't hear.

200
00:14:41,525 --> 00:14:43,493
-Hats off to who?
-The chef!

201
00:14:44,261 --> 00:14:46,062
That's right!

202
00:14:47,932 --> 00:14:53,504
You'II find that I don't micromanage.
I don't shy away from deIegating.

203
00:14:53,705 --> 00:14:58,344
That's good to know. But Iet's stop
focusing on what you don't do...

204
00:14:58,544 --> 00:15:00,646
...and focus on what you do do.

205
00:15:03,883 --> 00:15:06,252
What I do do...

206
00:15:08,488 --> 00:15:13,426
...is create an atmosphere of support
for the peopIe working with me.

207
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,228
Nice sidestep on the ''do do'' thing.

208
00:15:16,496 --> 00:15:20,132
-Hardest thing I've ever done.
-Oh, you gotta go!

209
00:15:20,601 --> 00:15:23,070
-Don't worry. You're ready.
-ReaIIy?

210
00:15:23,337 --> 00:15:28,776
AbsoIuteIy! Just fight aII your
naturaI instincts, and you'II be great.

211
00:15:29,978 --> 00:15:32,246
Monica, check these out.

212
00:15:33,648 --> 00:15:35,149
Those Iook Iike cookies.

213
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,386
I know, yeah.
And I made them aII by myseIf.

214
00:15:37,586 --> 00:15:40,555
I mixed the ingredients,
I put them in the oven, I took them out.

215
00:15:40,723 --> 00:15:44,126
Granted, I shouId have used
the oven mitts, but stiII.

216
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,696
Monica, my star student.

217
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:52,168
You caIIed me that before,
so I fashioned a star out of foiI.

218
00:15:52,469 --> 00:15:56,740
Now, no pressure. If you Iike my
cookies, you give me the star.

219
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:03,780
Wow, a star!

220
00:16:04,482 --> 00:16:08,753
I know you aII hate me,
and I'm sorry, but I don't care.

221
00:16:09,187 --> 00:16:12,590
-Okay, Joey, you're up next.
-Yeah.

222
00:16:14,393 --> 00:16:17,496
Oh, my God! This is amazing!

223
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,665
You get an A.

224
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:24,504
I got an A? In schooI?
Hey, I'm a dork!

225
00:16:26,005 --> 00:16:28,074
Joey, I'm so proud of you.

226
00:16:28,275 --> 00:16:31,311
-I think you shouId give him your star.
-Excuse me?

227
00:16:32,947 --> 00:16:36,984
-He doesn't know what he's doing.
-Nobody knows what they're doing.

228
00:16:37,218 --> 00:16:40,388
I do. I'm a professionaI chef!

229
00:16:40,655 --> 00:16:43,624
Oh, reIax. It's not a courtroom drama.

230
00:16:43,825 --> 00:16:46,695
Why are you taking
Introduction to Cooking?

231
00:16:46,895 --> 00:16:48,596
Yeah!

232
00:16:50,031 --> 00:16:53,935
I'm sorry. I cook at this restaurant,
AIIessandro's...

233
00:16:54,103 --> 00:16:56,205
...and I just got a bad review.

234
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:59,376
-AIIessandro's? I Iove that pIace!
-You do?

235
00:16:59,542 --> 00:17:02,712
You're a great chef.
As a person you're a IittIe--

236
00:17:02,946 --> 00:17:06,784
-Oh, I'm crazy, but you Iiked the food?
-Very much.

237
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:11,354
Okay, then. I don't stink.
I'm a good chef! Okay.

238
00:17:11,522 --> 00:17:13,957
I don't want to go. I'm having fun.

239
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,827
Did either of you pay for this cIass?

240
00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:20,965
Hey, if my friend says
it's time to go, it's time to go!

241
00:17:28,608 --> 00:17:34,247
I was the point person on my company's
transition from the KL5 to GR6 systems.

242
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,784
-You must have had your hands fuII.
-That I did. That I did.

243
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:43,089
So Iet's taIk a IittIe bit
about your duties.

244
00:17:46,827 --> 00:17:48,929
My duties?

245
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:53,400
AII right.

246
00:17:53,635 --> 00:17:58,072
You'II be heading a whoIe division,
so you'II have a Iot of duties.

247
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:04,780
-I see.
-But there'II be 30 peopIe under you...

248
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,983
...so you can dump
a certain amount on them.

249
00:18:11,988 --> 00:18:15,124
-Good to know.
-We couId go into detaiI--

250
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:17,327
No, don't, I beg of you.

251
00:18:17,527 --> 00:18:21,431
AII right. We'II have a definite
answer for you on Monday.

252
00:18:21,598 --> 00:18:25,735
But I can say with some
confidence, you'II fit in weII here.

253
00:18:26,103 --> 00:18:29,039
-ReaIIy?
-AbsoIuteIy.

254
00:18:30,141 --> 00:18:33,144
-You can reIax. You did great.
-Yeah, thanks.

255
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:37,315
I was reaIIy nervous.
I'm toId I come on too strongIy.

256
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:41,653
And then it was reaIIy hard
to sidestep that ''duty'' thing.

257
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,757
Duties?

258
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,826
Doodies?

259
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,863
Poo?

260
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:54,367
Poo?

261
00:18:55,568 --> 00:19:00,006
Oh, my God. This doesn't count. Okay?
The interview was over.

262
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:03,978
That was the reaI ChandIer Bing.
This is some crazy guy.

263
00:19:04,245 --> 00:19:08,182
CaII security! There's a crazy guy
out in the haII!

264
00:19:08,917 --> 00:19:10,952
Poo?

265
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,489
I'II Iook forward to your caII.

266
00:19:20,062 --> 00:19:21,530
-Hey.
-Hey.

267
00:19:21,731 --> 00:19:23,899
-You're back.
-How are you?

268
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:29,439
I'm fine. But that's not important.
What's important is how was she?

269
00:19:29,606 --> 00:19:32,175
It was fun.
We just had coffee.

270
00:19:32,409 --> 00:19:37,014
Oh, uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee,
a IittIe rub-rub-rub under the tabIe?

271
00:19:37,849 --> 00:19:40,852
What's going on?
Do you not Iike Katie?

272
00:19:41,118 --> 00:19:47,091
No. No, she was nice. I mean,
she was a IittIe sIutty, but who isn't?

273
00:19:47,292 --> 00:19:48,526
WeII, I Iiked her.

274
00:19:48,761 --> 00:19:53,632
Of course you did. You'd date a goriIIa
if it caIIed you Indiana Jones.

275
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:58,604
Did you get a fresh batch
of pregnancy hormones today?

276
00:19:58,771 --> 00:20:02,374
No. It's just that--
Katie bothered me.

277
00:20:02,609 --> 00:20:05,344
Why? What was wrong with her?

278
00:20:05,645 --> 00:20:09,082
There was nothing wrong with her.
She was IoveIy.

279
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:13,320
-Okay. So, what's the matter?
-I don't want you to date her.

280
00:20:13,621 --> 00:20:16,891
Why? What, are you jeaIous?

281
00:20:17,124 --> 00:20:21,028
Yes. And not because
I want you to go out with me.

282
00:20:21,196 --> 00:20:24,732
Because I don't want you
to go out with anybody.

283
00:20:24,966 --> 00:20:28,870
It's terribIe to even think this
and it's inappropriate...

284
00:20:29,071 --> 00:20:34,110
...but I want you to be at my constant
beck and caII, 24 hours a day.

285
00:20:34,443 --> 00:20:38,480
I'm very sorry, but that is
just the way that I feeI.

286
00:20:41,484 --> 00:20:43,953
-Okay.
-What?

287
00:20:44,221 --> 00:20:48,225
I won't date. I'II....

288
00:20:48,459 --> 00:20:51,329
I'II be here with you aII the time.

289
00:20:53,064 --> 00:20:55,166
ReaIIy?

290
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,170
But I'm being so unreasonabIe.

291
00:21:00,272 --> 00:21:05,677
True, but you're aIIowed to be
unreasonabIe. You're having our baby.

292
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:14,119
Oh, Ross, thank you. Thank you.

293
00:21:16,957 --> 00:21:19,425
You feeI better?

294
00:21:19,726 --> 00:21:23,697
No, not reaIIy. You're pressing
the baby into my bIadder...

295
00:21:23,964 --> 00:21:26,266
...and now I have to pee.

296
00:21:26,467 --> 00:21:27,668
-Okay.

297
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:31,105
-Yeah?
-Just one thing....

298
00:21:31,939 --> 00:21:37,879
We Iive together. You're having our
baby. I'm not gonna see anybody eIse.

299
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,017
Are you sure you don't want
something more?

300
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:48,524
Wow. I don't know, maybe--

301
00:21:48,757 --> 00:21:52,294
Oh, Rach, I was just messing around.

302
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:57,834
-Like you did when I had to pee?
-Oh! I knew that.

303
00:21:58,035 --> 00:22:01,205
I knew that!
I was just messing with you too!

304
00:22:03,574 --> 00:22:06,577
Okay. Because for a minute

305
00:22:06,844 --> 00:22:09,847

306
00:22:10,048 --> 00:22:12,984
That's just because I'm such
a good messer!

307
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:20,492

-Yeah?

308
00:22:20,726 --> 00:22:23,194

-Right.

309
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,869
I had a great time. I Iearned how to bake,
ate great food.

310
00:22:30,103 --> 00:22:35,375
It's my first A since 7th grade and
I didn't even sIeep with the teacher.

311
00:22:36,109 --> 00:22:38,979

00:22:43,084 --> 00:22:45,553
Let's start with some basics.

314
00:22:45,787 --> 00:22:51,460
Can anybody teII me what the difference
between upstage and downstage is?

315
00:22:57,533 --> 00:23:00,436
Yeah, this was a stupid idea.
