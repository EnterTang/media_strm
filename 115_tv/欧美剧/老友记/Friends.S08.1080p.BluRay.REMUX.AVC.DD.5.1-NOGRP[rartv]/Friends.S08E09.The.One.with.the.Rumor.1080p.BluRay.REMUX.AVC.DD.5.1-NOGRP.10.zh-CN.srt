1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,334
(当你怀孕时,你该期待什么)

2
00:00:08,738 --> 00:00:11,339
你知道怀孕的时候…
Did you know that during pregnancy...

3
00:00:11,607 --> 00:00:16,810
你的手指会肿成两倍大 而且再也不会消了吗?
...your fingers sweII up to twice their size and never go back?

4
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:19,612
天啊,让我看看
Oh, my God! Let me see that.

5
00:00:20,746 --> 00:00:23,915
你每次都会上当
You faII for it every time.

6
00:00:24,749 --> 00:00:27,785
我把我的旧孕妇装 拿来给你
Hey! I brought you my oId maternity cIothes.

7
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:32,954
菲比,那真的是太棒了 好可爱喔!
Oh, Pheebs, that's so sweet. Oh, those are so cute!

8
00:00:33,255 --> 00:00:37,425
你看,宝宝越长越大 它们也会跟着撑开来
Look. See how they expand as the baby grows?

9
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:42,928
宝宝出生后 可以穿它去偷西瓜
And after the baby's born they're great for shopIifting meIons.

10
00:00:44,998 --> 00:00:48,300
太好了,你们都在 感恩节,明天四点
Good, you're aII here. Thanksgiving, 4:00.

11
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:52,903
你猜我邀请了谁? 还记得高中同学威尔卡佛特吗?
Guess who I invited? Remember WiII CuIvert from high schooI?

12
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,771
-不 -他跟罗斯同班
-No. -He was in Ross' cIass.

13
00:00:56,006 --> 00:01:00,642
他是仪队的,有点胖 他是个大胖子
Marching band, was kind of overweight. ReaIIy overweight.

14
00:01:00,942 --> 00:01:02,876
我属于他瘦朋友那一群
I was his thin friend.

15
00:01:04,745 --> 00:01:09,148
我不记得 你是说你假想的男朋友吗?
I don't remember. Are you taIking about your imaginary boyfriend?

16
00:01:09,381 --> 00:01:12,317
不,那是贾拉德
No, that was Jared.

17
00:01:13,484 --> 00:01:17,320
我好久 没有想起他了
Wow. Haven't thought about him in a Iong time.

18
00:01:19,589 --> 00:01:23,992
威尔来城里出差,他没地方可去 所以我邀请他过来
WiII's here on business, and he didn't have a pIace to go, so I invited him here.

19
00:01:24,226 --> 00:01:28,595
-那很好啊 -他减肥成功
-That's nice. -Oh, he's Iost a bunch of weight.

20
00:01:28,795 --> 00:01:32,297
他看起来很不错 好吧,他真的是帅呆了
He Iooks good. Okay, I mean reaIIy gorgeous.

21
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:41,471
-我还爱着钱德 -偶尔说一下不会要你命的
-I stiII Iove ChandIer. -WouIdn't hurt you to say it once in a whiIe.

22
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,475
先说好了 今年我不煮火鸡…
Just so you know, I'm not gonna make a turkey this year..

23
00:01:47,075 --> 00:01:49,376
-什么? -菲比不吃火鸡
-What? -Phoebe doesn't eat turkey.

24
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:54,013
-菲比 -火鸡是漂亮聪明的动物
-Phoebe! -Turkeys are beautifuI, inteIIigent animaIs.

25
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:59,284
不是的
No, they're not! They're ugIy and stupid and deIicious!

26
00:01:59,451 --> 00:02:01,418
而且吃火鸡是传统
PIus, eating them is Iike a tradition.

27
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:06,356
这得回溯至第一次过感恩节时 印第安人跟牛仔坐在一起
It goes back to the first Thanksgiving when the Indians sat down with the cowboys.

28
00:02:07,057 --> 00:02:12,293
对,那个时候 他们在普利茅斯石办牛仔表演
Oh, right. That's when they had that big rodeo at PIymouth Rock.

29
00:02:12,727 --> 00:02:16,964
不只是菲比,威尔还在节食 钱德不吃感恩节食物…
It's not just Phoebe. WiII's stiII on a diet, ChandIer doesn't eat Thanksgiving food...

30
00:02:17,164 --> 00:02:20,532
-瑞秋对家禽类反胃 -是吗?
-...RacheI's having her aversion to pouItry. -She is?

31
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,135
对,记得吗? 那天你吃鸡肉时我得走开
Yeah. Remember? I had to Ieave the other day when you had that chicken.

32
00:02:24,335 --> 00:02:26,603
我以为那是因为 我手里…
I thought that was because I put the whoIe thing...

33
00:02:26,804 --> 00:02:28,938
拿着鸡要在桌上走的关系
...on my hand and made it waIk across the tabIe.

34
00:02:30,173 --> 00:02:35,076
为了三个人做一只火鸡太不划算了 那真的很费功夫
It's not worth it to make a whoIe turkey for just three peopIe. It's a Iot of work.

35
00:02:35,343 --> 00:02:37,778
但感恩节一定要吃火鸡啊
But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving!

36
00:02:38,012 --> 00:02:42,748
感恩节不吃火鸡 就像国庆日不吃苹果派
Thanksgiving with no turkey is Iike Fourth of JuIy with no appIe pie.

37
00:02:42,983 --> 00:02:46,151
或是星期五不吃两个披萨
Or Friday with no two pizzas.

38
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:50,821
好吧,如果它真的对你很重要 但到时候一定会剩下很多
Fine, if it means that much to you. But there's gonna be a ton Ieft over.

39
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:53,555
不,我发誓我会把那只火鸡吃完
No. I promise I wiII finish that turkey.

40
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:57,693
你是说你可以一次 吃掉一整只火鸡?
You're teIIing me you can eat aImost an entire turkey in one sitting?

41
00:02:57,926 --> 00:03:03,830
没错,因为我是崔比亚尼家的人 这是我们的专长
That's right. Because I'm a Tribbiani! This is what we do.

42
00:03:04,098 --> 00:03:08,033
我们不是伟大的思想家 或世界领袖…
We may not be great thinkers or worId Ieaders...

43
00:03:08,301 --> 00:03:13,004
我们书念的不多,跑不快 但该死,我们是大胃王
...we don't read a Iot or run fast, but damn it, we can eat!

44
00:03:13,971 --> 00:03:16,039
片名:六人行 (谣言)

45
00:03:48,763 --> 00:03:51,732
第四次长传,第三次18码
Four wide receivers. On third and 1 8.

46
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:57,569
明年桌边会坐一个宝宝 感觉真的很奇怪吧?
Isn't it weird how next year there wiII be a baby at the tabIe?

47
00:04:00,572 --> 00:04:04,341
我是指瑞秋的孩子 但我很高兴你还有在听我说话
RacheI's. But good to know where you're at.

48
00:04:05,042 --> 00:04:06,342
-嘿 -嘿
-Hey! -Hey!

49
00:04:06,576 --> 00:04:08,444
-感恩节快乐 -你也是
-Happy Thanksgiving. -You too!

50
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,578
-需要我帮忙吗? -好啊
-Can I heIp? -Yes.

51
00:04:10,812 --> 00:04:13,881
通常钱德会帮忙 但他看球赛看得正入迷
ChandIer usuaIIy heIps, but he's into the game.

52
00:04:14,148 --> 00:04:19,084
麻烦你帮忙摺餐巾 我要去对面看看地瓜泥好了没
CouId you foId these napkins? I'm gonna go across the haII to check on the yams.

53
00:04:19,352 --> 00:04:23,087
不,甜心,不是那样的
No, sweetie. No, not Iike that.

54
00:04:23,421 --> 00:04:26,423
我们不是在办农场舞会
We're not at a barn dance.

55
00:04:26,723 --> 00:04:30,359
把它们折成天鹅的形状 我在耶诞节时教过你,记得吗?
FoId them Iike swans. I showed you at Christmas. Remember?

56
00:04:30,526 --> 00:04:34,095
记得,一切历历如新
Yeah, it aII just came screaming back to me.

57
00:04:35,797 --> 00:04:37,164
制片:温蒂诺勒
-So how's the game? -I have no idea.

58
00:04:37,365 --> 00:04:40,132
-球赛还好看吗? -我不知道

59
00:04:40,433 --> 00:04:42,601
-什么? -我假装看球赛…
-What? -I'm pretending to watch...

60
00:04:42,835 --> 00:04:45,003
那样子就不必帮忙
...so I don't have to heIp out.

61
00:04:45,537 --> 00:04:47,372
编剧:莎纳高博米汉
I don't beIieve you! That is briIIiant!

62
00:04:47,605 --> 00:04:51,340
我不敢相信 这招太高明了

63
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,741
导演:盖瑞哈佛森
-And Monica has no idea? -No.

64
00:04:52,942 --> 00:04:54,410
-摩妮卡不知道? -对
Once in a whiIe, I just yeII stuff at the TV.

65
00:04:54,578 --> 00:04:57,813
偶尔 我会对着电视大叫

66
00:04:58,747 --> 00:05:01,816
嘿,什么?啊
Hey! What? Aw! Hey!

67
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,119
-你的球队赢了吗? -安德森刚刚又得分了
-Your team winning? -Anderson just scored again.

68
00:05:07,353 --> 00:05:10,155
根本就没有安德森这号人物
There is no Anderson.

69
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,525
我也想如法炮制,摩妮卡
I wanna get in on this. Hey, Mon?

70
00:05:14,725 --> 00:05:19,095
我真的没办法帮你 我不知道球赛打到哪里了
I can't heIp you after aII. I didn't reaIize this game was on.

71
00:05:19,328 --> 00:05:22,230
-你喜欢美式足球? -通常我是不喜欢
-You Iike footbaII? -NormaIIy, I don't.

72
00:05:22,464 --> 00:05:26,333
但今天是绿湾队在比赛
But, you know, Green Bay is pIaying.

73
00:05:26,867 --> 00:05:31,204
-你喜欢绿湾队? -那是我最喜欢的海湾
-You Iike Green Bay? -It's onIy my favorite bay.

74
00:05:42,845 --> 00:05:46,914
-感恩节快乐 -威尔,我很高兴你能来
-Happy Thanksgiving. -WiII, I'm so gIad that you came.

75
00:05:47,148 --> 00:05:48,949
你看起来帅呆了,你一定减掉了…
You Iook great. You must've Iost--

76
00:05:49,217 --> 00:05:53,853
150磅 我会是潜水艇三明治广告的下一号人选
1 50 pounds. I'II be on one of those Subway commerciaIs.

77
00:05:55,855 --> 00:06:00,225
-是派 -零脂肪,无糖,也没有奶
-A pie! -It's no fat, no sugar, no dairy.

78
00:06:00,491 --> 00:06:03,993
-它不好吃,丢了它 -我来介绍你们认识
-It's no good. Throw it out. -Meet some peopIe.

79
00:06:04,261 --> 00:06:07,230
他是我丈夫钱德 他是威尔
This is my husband, ChandIer. This is WiII.

80
00:06:07,496 --> 00:06:12,266
我很想跟你握手 但我忙着看球赛
Oh, hey. I'd shake your hand but I'm reaIIy into the game.

81
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,170
而且我们两个只要不站在一起 就不会伤了我的自尊
PIus, it'd be better for my ego if we didn't stand next to each other.

82
00:06:19,204 --> 00:06:20,772
-她是菲比 -嗨
-This is Phoebe. -Hi.

83
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:25,042
嘿,哇
Hey. Wow!

84
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,578
做的好
WeII done.

85
00:06:29,812 --> 00:06:34,982
-你要帮我吗? -我真的觉得你很漂亮
-Wanna give me a hand? -I can't get over how great you Iook.

86
00:06:35,216 --> 00:06:40,920
-你也很帅,你的身材真棒 -我在看球赛,但我没聋
-You Iook incredibIe too. You're so fit. -I'm watching the game, but I'm not deaf.

87
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:46,191
-我一直想告诉你,罗斯也会来 -太棒了,我喜欢罗斯
-I meant to teII you, Ross is coming. -Great, I Iove Ross.

88
00:06:46,391 --> 00:06:49,260
很好,瑞秋葛林也会来
Good. And RacheI Greene too.

89
00:06:52,528 --> 00:06:56,030
-有问题吗? -没有,没关系的
-Is there a probIem? -No. It's okay.

90
00:06:56,265 --> 00:07:00,200
那只是…天啊,我恨她
It's just.... God, I hated her.

91
00:07:00,868 --> 00:07:02,402
-什么? -我恨她
-What? -I hated her.

92
00:07:02,603 --> 00:07:05,838
高中时她对我很凶
She was horribIe to me in high schooI.

93
00:07:06,072 --> 00:07:12,009
但那是很久以前的事了,现在我很好 或许再见到她会很有趣
But hey, that was a Iong time ago. I'm in a good pIace. Might be fun to see her again.

94
00:07:12,243 --> 00:07:15,712
你有蛋糕或饼干吗?
Got any cakes or cookies or something?

95
00:07:17,213 --> 00:07:20,148
不,威尔
No, WiII! No!

96
00:07:20,383 --> 00:07:22,950
我们很久没大叫了 或许我们该大叫一下
It's been a whiIe since we screamed. Maybe we shouId.

97
00:07:23,218 --> 00:07:26,220
-好吧,不! -加油
-Oh, okay. No! -Come on!

98
00:07:26,453 --> 00:07:30,289
该死的裁判,下地狱去吧!
Damn you, ref! You burn in heII!

99
00:07:33,892 --> 00:07:38,261
你在做什么? 你还得吃掉一整只火鸡
What are you doing? You've got an entire turkey to eat.

100
00:07:38,496 --> 00:07:42,098
让我跟你解释一下 人体的运作方式
Let me expIain to you how the human body works.

101
00:07:42,331 --> 00:07:45,099
我得先让我的胃暖暖身
I have to warm up my stomach first.

102
00:07:45,401 --> 00:07:49,003
-吃薯片像是在做拉筋运动 -好吧
-Eating chips is Iike stretching. -Okay.

103
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:54,106
-别担心,崔比亚尼永远吃不饱 -我要告诉你一件事
-Don't worry, Tribbianis never get fuII. -I'm here to teII you something.

104
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:58,676
你可以吃个不停 但你无法填满内心的空虚
You can eat and eat, but nothing wiII ever fiII that void.

105
00:08:00,444 --> 00:08:05,647
-这家伙到底是谁? -他是我们的高中同学威尔,他是乔伊
-Who the heII is this guy? -This is WiII, from high schooI. This is Joey.

106
00:08:05,815 --> 00:08:07,816
-要来点薯片吗? -不
-Want some chips? -No.

107
00:08:10,084 --> 00:08:11,384
-威尔 -罗斯
-WiII! -Ross!

108
00:08:11,619 --> 00:08:17,556
你来了 天啊,你看起来棒极了,大帅哥

109
00:08:18,658 --> 00:08:21,960
-大帅哥? -很高兴能见到你
-Hot stuff? -It's good to see you, man.

110
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:24,962
我也是,你是做哪一行的?
Yeah. You too. So, what are you up to?

111
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:29,464
-我是期货经纪人 -听起来很有趣
-I'm a commodities broker. -That sounds interesting.

112
00:08:29,665 --> 00:08:32,266
-才怪 -喔
-Yeah, it's not. -Oh.

113
00:08:32,501 --> 00:08:35,570
-但我现在既有钱又苗条 -喔
-But I'm rich and thin. -Oh.

114
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:40,473
自从兰西戴维斯的毕业派对之后 我就没有见过你
I haven't seen you since Lance Davis' graduation party.

115
00:08:40,706 --> 00:08:42,474
那一晚真的很疯狂
That was such a fun night.

116
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:46,911
如果我们都有被邀请就好了 但那还是很疯狂
WouId've been good if we had gotten in, but stiII fun.

117
00:08:47,111 --> 00:08:51,781
那时我们逊呆了 你还记得我们多迷恐龙吗?
We were Iame. Do you remember how into dinosaurs we were?

118
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,485
-对 -你是做哪一行的?
-Yeah. -So, what do you do now?

119
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,888
你要在城里待多久?
So how Iong are you in town?

120
00:09:03,057 --> 00:09:06,625
-嗨 -嘿,甜心,太好了
-Hi. -Hey, sweetie. Oh, good.

121
00:09:06,825 --> 00:09:08,293
瑞秋葛林
RacheI Greene.

122
00:09:10,028 --> 00:09:12,763
啊,对了 你没事吧?
Oh, that's right. Are you gonna be okay?

123
00:09:12,997 --> 00:09:19,101
我没事,只是… 天啊,罗斯,我恨她
Oh, I'II be fine. It's just-- God, I hate her, Ross! I hate her!

124
00:09:21,136 --> 00:09:23,437
高中是很久以前的事了
High schooI was a Iong time ago.

125
00:09:23,671 --> 00:09:26,739
看看她拿着地瓜泥 站在那里的样子
Look at her standing there with those yams.

126
00:09:26,974 --> 00:09:32,578
我的两个死对头 瑞秋葛林跟碳水化合物
My two greatest enemies: RacheI Greene and compIex carbohydrates.

127
00:09:33,979 --> 00:09:35,846
天啊,那是谁?
Oh, my God. Who is that?

128
00:09:37,147 --> 00:09:42,350
-他是我们的高中同学威尔 -我不记得他了
-That's WiII, from high schooI. -Oh! I do not remember him.

129
00:09:42,618 --> 00:09:48,054
他真的 越来越性感了
Wow, reaIIy got that sexy smoIdering thing going on.

130
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:56,027
天啊 看他盯着我瞧的样子
Oh, my God. Look at the way he's just staring at me.

131
00:09:56,328 --> 00:09:58,896
他用唇语跟我说话
He's trying to mouth something to me.

132
00:09:59,197 --> 00:10:02,799
我恨你
I hate you!

133
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,267
-好了,晚餐准备好了 -好吧
-Okay, dinner's ready! -Okay!

134
00:10:06,502 --> 00:10:10,370
-真的很精彩 -谁赢了?
-SoIid effort. SoIid effort. -Oh, so who won?

135
00:10:10,571 --> 00:10:12,906
-绿湾队 -底特律队
-Green Bay. -Detroit.

136
00:10:13,107 --> 00:10:15,641
-什么? -技术上来说狮队赢了
-What? -The Lions technicaIIy won.

137
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:20,812
但在士气方面 是绿湾美人鱼队赢了
But it was a moraI victory for the Green Bay Mermen.

138
00:10:23,781 --> 00:10:27,984
嗨,你是威尔吧? 嗨,我是瑞秋葛林
Hi! WiII, right? Right, hi. I'm RacheI Greene.

139
00:10:28,184 --> 00:10:33,287
-我记得你 -真的吗?你真好
-Oh, I remember you. -ReaIIy? Aren't you sweet?

140
00:10:33,522 --> 00:10:38,691
我得告诉你 我真的很难记得你的样子
I gotta teII you, I'm having the hardest time pIacing you.

141
00:10:38,926 --> 00:10:41,327
等一下,我想我记得你
Hang on! I think I remember you.

142
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:47,030
我们在兰西戴维斯的毕业派对上 厮混过?
Did we fooI around at Lance Davis' graduation party?

143
00:10:47,698 --> 00:10:50,934
-你真是不可思议 -谢谢你
-You are unbeIievabIe. -Thank you.

144
00:10:51,868 --> 00:10:57,071
瑞秋,你坐这边 威尔,你坐到那边去
RacheI? Why don't you sit here? And WiII, you sit way over there.

145
00:11:02,976 --> 00:11:06,445
就那样?即使没有人帮我 我也可以吃掉它,没问题
That's it? Even if nobody heIps me, I can eat that. No probIem.

146
00:11:06,712 --> 00:11:11,982
-至少给我一点挑战 -这是钱德的鸡肉
-At Ieast give me a chaIIenge. -This is ChandIer's chicken.

147
00:11:13,584 --> 00:11:16,719
这才是火鸡
This is the turkey.

148
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,856
那有多大呢?
Oh. How big is that?

149
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:26,459
-大约19磅 -它跟我刚出生时差不多大
-About 1 9 pounds. -It's Iike me when I was born.

150
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,629
-谁想吃地瓜泥?威尔? -你喜欢那样做,对吧?
-Who wouId Iike some yams? WiII? -You'd Iike that, wouIdn't you?

151
00:11:34,265 --> 00:11:37,233
什么? 拜把鸡肉…
What? Oh, can we pIease keep the chicken...

152
00:11:37,434 --> 00:11:39,935
跟火鸡放到另一边去
...and the turkey on the other side?

153
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:43,938
-那个味道真的… -太典型了
-The smeII is just-- -TypicaI.

154
00:11:45,774 --> 00:11:48,108
-什么? -我说那太典型了
-What? -I said it was typicaI.

155
00:11:48,376 --> 00:11:54,446
你的典型作风,瑞秋女王 在瑞秋王国想做什么就做什么
TypicaI of you. Queen RacheI does whatever she wants in RacheI-Iand.

156
00:11:58,883 --> 00:12:00,717
说真的,这家伙是谁?
SeriousIy, who is this guy?

157
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:04,887
抱歉,你对我有问题吗?
Sorry, do you have a probIem with me?

158
00:12:05,088 --> 00:12:10,124
-我不知道,我有吗? -我想你有
-I don't know. Do I? Do I? -I think you do.

159
00:12:11,792 --> 00:12:14,526
你在高中时对他有点凶
You were a IittIe mean to him in high schooI.

160
00:12:14,761 --> 00:12:19,431
-有点凶?你让我活在痛苦深渊 -我不知道,抱歉
-A IittIe mean? You made my Iife miserabIe. -I had no idea. I'm sorry.

161
00:12:19,631 --> 00:12:23,333
你应该抱歉的 去他的,把地瓜泥拿过来给我
WeII, you shouId be. Screw it. Bring on the yams.

162
00:12:23,767 --> 00:12:25,335
但你很努力在减肥
But you worked so hard.

163
00:12:25,535 --> 00:12:27,969
-地瓜泥 -好的
-Yams! -Okay.

164
00:12:30,672 --> 00:12:35,275
不论在高中时我对你做了什么 我都非常抱歉
I'm reaI sorry for whatever I did to you in high schooI.

165
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:38,412
不只是我,我们组了一个社圃
It wasn't just me. We had a cIub.

166
00:12:38,645 --> 00:12:43,515
-你们组了一个社圃? -《我恨瑞秋葛林社》
-You had a cIub? -The ''I Hate RacheI Greene CIub'' !

167
00:12:43,782 --> 00:12:47,418
你们全都聚在一起恨我?
So you aII just joined together to hate me?

168
00:12:47,651 --> 00:12:51,954
-还有谁加入那个社圃? -我跟罗斯
-Who eIse was in this cIub? -Me and Ross.

169
00:12:56,458 --> 00:13:00,327
你不必指我 她知道罗斯是谁
No need to point. She knows who Ross is.

170
00:13:06,598 --> 00:13:10,901
-你参加《我恨瑞秋社》? -没错
-You were in an ''I Hate RacheI'' cIub? -Yes, he was.

171
00:13:11,135 --> 00:13:12,368
不
No, no.

172
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:19,974
-还有谁参加了你们的社圃? -那个来自泰国的交换学生
-So who eIse was in this cIub? -That exchange student from ThaiIand.

173
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:24,345
但我想他不知道那是怎么一回事
But I don't think he knew what it was.

174
00:13:24,645 --> 00:13:26,912
你们太酷了
You guys were cooI.

175
00:13:27,747 --> 00:13:29,514
罗斯,我们交往了两年…
So, Ross, we went out for two years...

176
00:13:29,682 --> 00:13:32,517
你没有告诉我 你参加过《我恨瑞秋社》?
...and you never toId me you were in an ''I Hate RacheI CIub''?

177
00:13:32,684 --> 00:13:36,119
你跟她交往过?我们说好的
You went out with her? We had a pact.

178
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:43,458
-那不是永久的约定 -我们的确说了“永远”
-It's not Iike it was binding forever. -It had the word ''eternity'' in it.

179
00:13:44,725 --> 00:13:47,761
我考虑要加入《我恨火鸡社》
I'm thinking of joining an ''I Hate Turkey CIub.''

180
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:50,563
虽然我喜欢吃火鸡三明治
AIthough, I do Iove a turkey cIub.

181
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,367
摩妮卡,你知道这件事吗?
Monica? Did you know about this?

182
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,735
我不知道 所以你们才会常把房门锁上吗?
I didn't. Is that why you used to Iock the bedroom door?

183
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:03,472
-对 -我得说我松了一口气
-Yeah. -A IittIe reIieved, I gotta say.

184
00:14:05,307 --> 00:14:09,943
听着,瑞秋,我很抱歉,好吗? 那时我是个愚蠢的孩子
Look, Rach, I'm sorry, okay? I was a stupid kid, okay?

185
00:14:10,211 --> 00:14:12,579
-我会加入社圃是因为… -是一起成立
-The onIy reason I joined-- -Cofounded.

186
00:14:12,746 --> 00:14:14,614
一起成立
Cofounded.

187
00:14:16,082 --> 00:14:19,650
我会一起成立那个社圃 因为我那时疯狂地爱着你
Cofounded the cIub, was that I was in Iove with you.

188
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:23,887
我处理的不好 如果你把《我恨瑞秋社》…
I didn't handIe it very weII. If you think about it, the ''I Hate RacheI CIub'' ...

189
00:14:24,188 --> 00:14:27,123
想成《我爱瑞秋社》
...was reaIIy the ''I Love RacheI CIub.''

190
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,492
但它真的是 《我恨瑞秋社》
Except that it was reaIIy the ''I Hate RacheI CIub.''

191
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:35,062
你们一起说我的坏话?
So you'd get together and say mean things about me?

192
00:14:35,296 --> 00:14:39,632
-不只是那样 -不
-We did a IittIe more than that. -No, no, no.

193
00:14:40,065 --> 00:14:41,500
你们还做了什么?
What eIse did you do?

194
00:14:41,734 --> 00:14:45,869
-我们散布一个谣言 -什么谣言?
-We started a rumor. -What rumor?

195
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:50,106
快点,威尔 挣脱束缚告诉我们
Come on, WiII, just take off your shirt and teII us.

196
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:56,076
-罗斯 -那真的没什么
-Ross? -It was no big deaI.

197
00:14:56,377 --> 00:15:02,148
我们说…那个谣言是…
We said that-- The rumor was that...

198
00:15:02,415 --> 00:15:07,751
你同时有 男性跟女性的生殖器官
...you had both maIe and femaIe reproductive parts.

199
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,921
-什么? -没错,我们说你爸妈…
-What? -That's right. We said your parents...

200
00:15:11,088 --> 00:15:17,592
丢铜板决定把你当成女孩养大 但你还是有小鸡鸡
...fIipped a coin, decided to raise you as a girI, but you stiII had a hint of a penis.

201
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,628
-天啊 -那是你们编的?
-Oh, my God! -You started that?

202
00:15:20,862 --> 00:15:25,365
-你也听过? -我们学校里每个人都听过
-You heard that? -Everyone at our schooI heard it!

203
00:15:25,565 --> 00:15:28,867
我的学校里每个人都听过 你就是那个双性啦啦队员?
Everyone at my schooI heard it. You were the hermaphrodite cheerIeader?

204
00:15:29,101 --> 00:15:31,069
不
Oh, no!

205
00:15:32,337 --> 00:15:36,673
现在我终于懂了 所以亚当卡特不想跟我约会
It makes sense now. This is why Adam Carter wouIdn't go out with me.

206
00:15:36,906 --> 00:15:39,875
为什么比利 只想停留在这一区
Why BiIIy wouId just stay in this region.

207
00:15:40,143 --> 00:15:44,278
比利成了男同志 所以那不是我们的错
BiIIy's gay now, so that one's not reaIIy our fauIt.

208
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,048
-你为什么不告诉我? -我想或许那是真的
-Why didn't you teII me? -I thought it might be true.

209
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:53,618
我担心你会大哭 把它掏出来给我看
I was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me.

210
00:15:59,289 --> 00:16:02,758
别看了,那里面没有东西 那不是真的
Stop staring! There's nothing there! It's not true!

211
00:16:02,992 --> 00:16:05,426
恐怕我需要证据
I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.

212
00:16:06,962 --> 00:16:08,262
快掏出来吧
Come on, whip it out.

213
00:16:25,141 --> 00:16:28,177
你是我的圣母峰
You are my Everest.

214
00:16:28,377 --> 00:16:32,746
-你不必吃完它 -我要,不然接下来是什么?
-You don't have to finish. -I do. Otherwise, what's next?

215
00:16:33,014 --> 00:16:38,217
今天我吃不完一只火鸡 明天我只能吃一半的三明治…
Today I can't finish a turkey, but tomorrow I eat haIf a PowerBar...

216
00:16:38,485 --> 00:16:41,753
把剩下的东西包起来 放在冰箱?不
...wrap it up and put it in the fridge? No!

217
00:16:41,987 --> 00:16:47,190
我得去换条裤子,我在想什么? 牛仔裤根本没有伸缩性
I gotta change my pants. What was I thinking? Jeans have no give.

218
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:51,260
大家来帮我洗碗 要洗的锅子真的很多
Guys, heIp me with the dishes. There's a Iot of pots and pans.

219
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,095
甜心,我很想 但第二场比赛快开始了
Honey, I'd Iove to, but the second game is about to start.

220
00:16:54,229 --> 00:16:58,932
对,第二场比赛 菲比队要看足球赛
Oh, yeah, the second game. More footbaII for the Pheebster.

221
00:16:59,099 --> 00:17:01,333
-哪一队要比赛? -洛杉矶队
-Who's pIaying? -Los AngeIes.

222
00:17:01,501 --> 00:17:04,369
据我所知 洛杉矶没有美式足球队
Last time I checked, Los AngeIes didn't have a footbaII team.

223
00:17:04,536 --> 00:17:08,405
我说洛杉矶吗? 我是说以前在洛杉矶…
Did I say Los AngeIes? I meant the team that used to be in Los AngeIes...

224
00:17:08,572 --> 00:17:12,308
现在在圣路易斯队的球队 我真的知道这件事
...and is now in St. Louis. I actuaIIy knew that.

225
00:17:12,509 --> 00:17:15,477
快说出 那只球队的三个球员
Okay, quick, name three pIayers on that team.

226
00:17:15,644 --> 00:17:17,078
葛瑞斯基…
Gretzky...

227
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:20,548
阿格西…
...Agassi....

228
00:17:22,883 --> 00:17:25,351
我是个小美女
I'm a pretty IittIe girI.

229
00:17:29,421 --> 00:17:34,490
你们看史恩麦马洪 在我的纪念册上写了什么
Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote in my yearbook senior year.

230
00:17:34,691 --> 00:17:39,661
“亲爱的瑞秋,你真是个好人” 我不是女孩,我是“人”
''Dear Rach, you're such a great person.'' Not girI, ''person.''

231
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:43,697
我想你太敏感了
I think you're reading a IittIe too much into it.

232
00:17:43,998 --> 00:17:47,867
“你是个好人 关于你有小鸡鸡的事我很遗憾”
''You're a great person. Sorry about your teeny weenie.''

233
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,071
你要我怎么做? 你要我…
What do you want me to do...

234
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:56,473
打电话给全校的人 告诉他们那不是真的?
...caII everyone in the entire schooI and teII them it wasn't true?

235
00:17:56,674 --> 00:17:59,208
-对 -顺便告诉他们我变瘦了
-Yes. -AIso, teII them I'm skinny now.

236
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:02,277
还有我
Oh! Me too!

237
00:18:02,478 --> 00:18:06,013
我不会打电话给任何人 那是很久以前的事了
I won't caII anybody. It was a miIIion years ago.

238
00:18:06,214 --> 00:18:11,684
我不在乎 你们告诉大家我是双性人
I don't care. You toId peopIe that I was haIf and haIf!

239
00:18:11,952 --> 00:18:15,687
在高中时 我没有做过任何伤害你的事
I never did anything to hurt you in high schooI.

240
00:18:16,488 --> 00:18:18,322
那不完全是真的
That's not totaIIy true.

241
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,823
-什么? -什么?
-What? -What?

242
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:22,860
你告诉大家罗斯…
You did start that rumor about Ross...

243
00:18:23,093 --> 00:18:27,863
跟50岁大的图书馆员 亚特曼太太亲亲抱抱
...making out with Mrs. AItmann, our 50-year-oId Iibrarian.

244
00:18:28,464 --> 00:18:30,598
你怎么知道那个的?
How did you know that?

245
00:18:33,734 --> 00:18:37,136
-那是真的? -不
-It's true? -No.

246
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:41,839
不,那是真的,我看到你们 躲在书卡柜的后面
Yes, it is. I saw you guys going at it behind the card cataIog.

247
00:18:42,007 --> 00:18:47,043
-你在图书馆里做什么? -图书馆里有杂志
-Hey, what were you doing in the Iibrary? -They had magazines.

248
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,744
亚特曼太太,她在…
Mrs. AItmann? She aIso made out...

249
00:18:50,012 --> 00:18:54,047
塔塔卡奇奇回泰国前一晚 也跟他耳鬓厮磨了一下
...with Ta-Taka-Ki-Kek the night before he went back to ThaiIand.

250
00:18:55,183 --> 00:18:58,885
高中时 你跟50岁的女人耳鬓厮磨?
In high schooI you made out with a 50-year-oId woman?

251
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:03,254
-她看起来不像50岁了 -她看起来像16岁吗?
-Hey, she didn't Iook 50! -Did she Iook 1 6?

252
00:19:03,489 --> 00:19:07,591
事实上纪念册里 有她的照片
There's a picture of her in the yearbook actuaIIy.

253
00:19:08,092 --> 00:19:11,994
-哇 -她不太上相
-Wow. -She didn't photograph weII!

254
00:19:12,228 --> 00:19:14,596
或者她不知道 该怎么…
She probabIy wasn't famiIiar with the process...

255
00:19:14,763 --> 00:19:17,865
花时间 练习坐下来当油画模特貌
...having spent most of her Iife sitting for oiI paintings.

256
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:24,070
这是怎么发生的? 她一放学就请你吃晚餐引诱你?
How did this happen? Did she Iure you to an earIy-bird dinner?

257
00:19:30,174 --> 00:19:35,778
有一天下午我在图书馆里看书看得很晚 馆里只有我们两个
I was working Iate in the Iibrary one afternoon. It was just the two of us.

258
00:19:35,979 --> 00:19:39,948
她需要人帮忙玩填字游戏
She needed some heIp with her word jumbIe.

259
00:19:40,349 --> 00:19:44,084
事情很自然就发生了
And one thing Ied to another.

260
00:19:44,652 --> 00:19:50,323
我得告诉你们 安妮塔非常仁慈温柔
If you must know, Anita was very gentIe and tender.

261
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,759
希望她能得到安息
May she rest in peace.

262
00:19:57,194 --> 00:20:01,597
-她不是柱着收茸呗仿? -只有在天气潮湿时
-Didn't she waIk with a cane? -OnIy when it was damp!

263
00:20:02,064 --> 00:20:07,100
我不相信你告诉大家这件事 大家都知道吗?
I can't beIieve you toId peopIe about this. Everybody knew?

264
00:20:07,368 --> 00:20:11,704
-好了,我要重回社圃 -耶
-You know what? I'm back in the cIub! -Yeah!

265
00:20:11,871 --> 00:20:14,740
-我要召开大会吗? -大家都得来吗?
-ShaII I caII the meeting to order? -Is everybody present?

266
00:20:14,907 --> 00:20:17,342
只有塔塔卡没有
With the exception of Ta-Taka.

267
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:19,376
-我要加入 -菲比
-I wanna join! -Phoebe?

268
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:23,947
抱歉,我从来没有加入过社圃 我没有念过高中
I'm sorry, but I never got to be in a cIub. I didn't go to high schooI.

269
00:20:24,213 --> 00:20:28,816
但我们三个 可以躲在垃圾箱后面学法文
But three of us wouId meet behind a dumpster to Iearn French.

270
00:20:29,084 --> 00:20:31,986
好吧 你们可以继续那个愚蠢的小社圃
Fine, you can have your stupid, IittIe cIub.

271
00:20:32,153 --> 00:20:36,589
但你对我做的事 比我对你做的事更糟糕
But what you did to me is way worse than what I did to you.

272
00:20:36,822 --> 00:20:40,258
-你说我有小鸡鸡 -对
-You gave me a teeny weenie. -Yeah!

273
00:20:43,461 --> 00:20:47,463
你真的太傻了 瑞秋,即使有那个谣言…
You're just being siIIy. RacheI, even with that rumor...

274
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:51,900
你还是最受欢迎的女孩 大家都希望能跟你一样
...you were one of the most popuIar girIs. Everyone wanted to be Iike you.

275
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:55,935
有个女孩太想变得跟你一样 她把棒条糖塞进裤档里
One girI wanted to be Iike you so much, she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie RoII.

276
00:20:56,136 --> 00:20:57,937
哇
Wow.

277
00:20:59,273 --> 00:21:03,476
罗斯,要不是她的谣言 没有人会知道你是谁
And Ross, if it weren't for her rumor, no one wouId've known who you were.

278
00:21:03,676 --> 00:21:08,712
-是她让你成名 -以老女人的情人成名
-She put you on the map. -As a romancer of the eIderIy.

279
00:21:09,946 --> 00:21:13,148
可以看得出来亚特曼太太 她以前很漂亮
Mrs. AItmann, you can teII, she used to be pretty.

280
00:21:13,349 --> 00:21:17,385
她的眼睛还是会发光
The eyes did stiII sparkIe.

281
00:21:18,186 --> 00:21:22,722
这是很久以前的事了 你们也经历过很多事
This stuff is so way in the past. You've been through so much since then.

282
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,725
你们的未来 还有许多更重要的事
You got so much more important stuff going on in your Iife.

283
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:29,426
你们不能忘了这件事吗?
Can't you just Iet this go?

284
00:21:31,862 --> 00:21:35,631
-她说的对 -我们的孩子快出生了
-She's right. -We are having a baby together.

285
00:21:35,865 --> 00:21:37,766

-你们要结婚了? -不
-Are you getting married? -No.

288
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:49,508
你搞大她的肚子 但你不娶她,兄弟
So you knocked her up but you're not gonna marry her. Dude.

289
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:55,679
-有人要吗? -好吧
-Anybody? -Okay.

290
00:22:00,049 --> 00:22:02,717
它跟我想像中完全一样
It's exactIy how I imagined it wouId be.

291
00:22:05,453 --> 00:22:08,187
好吧,火鸡在哪里?
AII right, where's that turkey?

292
00:22:12,892 --> 00:22:18,630
-那是我的孕妇裤 -不,这是我的感恩节裤
-Those are my maternity pants! -No, these are my Thanksgiving pants!

293
00:22:25,067 --> 00:22:28,236
好了,我吃完了
WeII, that's it. I'm done.

294
00:22:30,704 --> 00:22:32,739
留下了肉汗
Here come the meat sweats.

295
00:22:37,209 --> 00:22:39,977

WeII, Joey, we're aII very proud of you.

296
00:22:40,211 --> 00:22:44,180

I beIieve we can expect a caII from the president any moment now.

297
00:22:45,182 --> 00:22:49,585
-有什么我们可以帮忙的吗? -不必了,但千万别压我的胃
-Anything we can do? -No. Just nobody press on my stomach.

298
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,820
还有,那条裤子你不用还了
You can keep those pants, by the way.

299
00:22:54,021 --> 00:22:58,123
那是什么? 那是派吗?
What you got there? What is that, pie?

300
00:22:58,324 --> 00:23:02,460
-对,你要吃一点吗? -切一小块给我就行了
