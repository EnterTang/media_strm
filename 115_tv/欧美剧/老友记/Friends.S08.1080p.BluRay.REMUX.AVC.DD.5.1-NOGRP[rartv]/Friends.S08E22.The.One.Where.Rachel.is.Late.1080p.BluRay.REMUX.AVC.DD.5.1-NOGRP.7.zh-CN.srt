1
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:06,600
What are you looking at?

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,640
A poster for that WWI movie I'm in. 
Check it out.

3
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:13,378
Wow! It looks really violent!

4
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:15,910
I know. I'm coming soon to a theater near you.

5
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:18,550
I'm in THX. I'm unsuitable for children!

6
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:23,949
- I cannot wait to see this. 
- It's generating Oscar buzz.

7
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,318
- I started that!
- I thought I did!

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,528
I just talked to my agent...

9
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:33,560
...and the premiere is next week and you're all invited!

10
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:35,667
- Will we take a limo?
- Sure!

11
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:39,594
I love taking limos when nobody died.

12
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,864
Well, I won't be able to come.

13
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:46,202
For those who haven't checked their calendars, today's my due date.

14
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:48,812
You should come. 
Maybe you'll have the baby in the limo.

15
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:52,574
That way for the first few moments of her life, 
she'll think we're really fancy.

16
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:58,148
I want to thank you guys for how great you've been during this.

17
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:02,384
I couldn't have done it without you. 
I loved these last 9 months.

18
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:04,756
I'm looking forward to the next part...

19
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:07,631
...I am really gonna miss being pregnant.

20
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:15,464
That's right. Still no baby.

21
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,276
What's the matter? Is the puffy, sweaty pregnant lady...

22
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:21,480
...disturbing your precious coffee time?

23
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:25,242
Come on, people, make some room.

24
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:29,114
Sweetie, maybe you'd be more comfortable here.

25
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,890
You.

26
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,324
Like you haven't done enough.

27
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:42,594
I know you're miserable. 
I wish there was something I could do.

28
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:46,067
I wish I were a sea horse.

29
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:52,367
Because with sea horses, it's the male. 
They carry the babies.

30
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:58,540
And then also, I'd be far away in the sea.

31
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,130
God.

32
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:17,792
I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life.

33
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,368
I know. I remember toward the end...

34
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:25,340
That's a great story. 
Tell it while you're getting me some iced tea.

35
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:32,016
Oh, God, get out! Get out, get out, get out!

36
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,284
Let's.

37
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:40,824
The One Where Rachel Is Late

40
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:18,026
Hey, did you have the baby yet?

41
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:23,565
Do you want me to sit on you? 
Because I'll do it.

42
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,637
- What are you doing here? 
- They sent me home from work.

43
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:31,138
They said, "Start your maternity leave now. Just rest."

44
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,276
You know what? Screw them!

45
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,142
If they don't want me there, I'll hang out with you guys.

46
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:41,314
Or you could do volunteer work.

47
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:45,314
- Hello?
- Joey, it's Estelle.

48
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:50,357
I was able to get you and one guest tickets to your premiere.

49
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:55,226
- You told me I could have six tickets. 
- I sold four on eBay.

50
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,997
You'll be sitting next to HotGuy372.

51
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:04,700
So that's it? I only get to bring one guest?

52
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:08,947
Yeah. What time you wanna pick me up?

53
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:10,872
Hello?

54
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:15,016
You hear that? I only get one extra ticket to my premiere.

55
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:19,282
So somehow I have to pick between you three and Ross.

56
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,293
- What about me? 
- You said you didn't want to go.

57
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:27,395
I don't. But I would still like to be acknowledged.

58
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:32,333
- Because I'm pregnant, I'm invisible? 
- Definitely not invisible.

59
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:37,932
Ross didn't care enough to be here, so he's out.

60
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,839
- You snooze, you lose. 
- He's not snoozing. He's teaching.

61
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,174
Well, then somebody's snoozing.

62
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:49,514
And, Joey, not that this should affect you at all, but if you pick me...

63
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:55,126
...I was planning on wearing a sequin dress cut down to here.

64
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:58,686
- I haven't seen this dress. 
- Star in a movie.

65
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:05,263
Pick whoever you want. Listen to your heart. 
What does it tell you?

66
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,336
Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe.

67
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,401
Well...

68
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:16,345
I think I want to take Chandler.

69
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:19,109
Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe.

70
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:25,487
- You want to take me? 
- Yeah, I wish I could take everybody.

71
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:28,558
But Chandler's always supported my career.

72
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:32,026
He's paid for acting classes, headshots and stuff.

73
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,926
This will be my way of paying you back.

74
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:39,070
So you're never actually going to pay me back?

75
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,601
Just because he paid for your headshots, you're gonna take him?

76
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:49,679
I don't think you're comprehending just how slutty this dress is.

77
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:54,885
It's not just the stuff he paid for.
It's everything, you know?

78
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,954
He read lines with me. 
He went with me on auditions when I was nervous.

79
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:02,317
Then he consoled me after I didn't get parts that I wanted.

80
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:05,961
You always believed in me, man, even when I didn't.

81
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:10,224
I always knew you were gonna make it. 
I'm so proud of you.

82
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,462
Thanks, that means a lot to me.

83
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:20,476
Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.

84
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:25,816
- I'm gonna go shave. 
- Yeah, well, I'm gonna go spit.

85
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,023
I have to pee.

86
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:37,355
If I don't come out, it's because I've choked to death on the potpourri stink.

87
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:44,859
You hold her nose, I'll blow in her mouth and the kid'll just... out of her.

88
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:49,498
She's a week late. She's got to have it today.

89
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:53,940
I don't know. I think it's still gonna be a while.

90
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:56,511
Care to make it interesting?

91
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:59,980
- I bet you she'll have it tomorrow. 
- You're on.

92
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:03,553
- Okay, how much? 
- One hundred thousand dollars.

93
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:09,657
- How about 50 bucks? 
- I'll call Zurich and move some money.

94
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:13,228
All right, whose turn is it to help me get up?

95
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,261
No one's here.

96
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,899
Oh, damn it!

97
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:38,288
This is exciting. So glamorous! People taking our picture. 
How do I look?

98
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,326
- A little tall.
- What?

99
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:45,654
Would you crouch down a bit so that I look taller?

100
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,096
There you go.

101
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:53,263
It's just so glamorous.

102
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,474
Oh, hey, Mon? Rach is here.

103
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:02,442
And you're still pregnant.

104
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:05,513
I'm sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are.

105
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:10,484
You know what? You look great. 
Yeah, like 50 bucks.

106
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:17,721
I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks my bladder is a squeeze toy.

107
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:22,968
Damn it. Here's your 50 bucks.

108
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:28,136
That's interesting that you lost. 
Now, I forget, do you like to lose?

109
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:30,433
All right, stop it.

110
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:33,712
- Double or nothing she has it tomorrow. 
- Fine.

111
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:39,350
Until then, General Grant, why don't you set up camp... right there?

112
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,921
- Rachel here? We have an appointment. 
- In the bathroom.

113
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:47,283
- Rach, we gotta go.
- In a minute!

114
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:54,560
People ask why we're not together. 
I just don't know what to tell them.

115
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,132
All right, let's go.

116
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,401
Oh, wait a minute.

117
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,163
Do I have to pee again?

118
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:03,341
No, I'm good.

119
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,737
Do you want to go change first?

120
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:09,709
The doctor's staying open late for us, but if you hurry...

121
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:14,316
- No, I'm fine. 
- You don't think that's inappropriate?

122
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:18,081
- What? 
- Good God, man. Don't anger it.

123
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:27,224
Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. 
For the first time in weeks, I am...

124
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:30,925
Fine. Whatever you want. 
You're the mommy.

125
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,002
No! Don't call me "Mommy."

126
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:36,867
It's bad enough you call your own mother that.

127
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,841
I'm actually with her on this one.

128
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:43,315
Come on, Ross. We're gonna be late.

129
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:47,045
Either of you want to be Ross?

130
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,351
I thought I knew who the enemy was, but it was you.

131
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:01,930
Okay, this is it. This is my big fight scene coming up.

132
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:05,962
I'm fighting for every man in the 82nd Ground Division.

133
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,579
Ross? Can I ask you something?

134
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:21,648
When Carol was pregnant with Ben...

135
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:24,746
...were you this irritating?

136
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,252
- Excuse me?
- Nothing. You're just...

137
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:35,490
You've been a little short with me lately. 
I'm not trying to irritate you.

138
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:39,501
Well, then, you must have a natural talent for it.

139
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:44,105
The doctor will be in soon. 
Why don't we not speak until then?

140
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:45,503
Okay.

141
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,909
Seriously. Breathe louder, Ross. That's great.

142
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:59,057
We should ask the doctor if she even knows...

143
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:04,456
...how to deliver a baby that's half human, half pure evil!

144
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,800
- Hi, Dr. Long. How are you? 
- You're nice to her.

145
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:12,867
She has the drugs.

146
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,000
We'll do a quick check.

147
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:19,802
Eight days late, huh? You must be getting uncomfortable.

148
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,446
Yeah, just a tad.

149
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:28,080
You're 80% effaced. You're on your way. 
It still could last a while.

150
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:33,256
- There are ways to help things along. 
- Do them!

151
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,788
Actually, they're things that you can do. Home remedies.

152
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:41,658
In my experience, I've found some are very effective.

153
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:47,269
- Well, we are ready to try anything. 
- There's an herbal tea you can drink.

154
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,976
You can take some castor oil. 
There's spicy foods.

155
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:52,870
We will do all of those.

156
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,339
- Taking a long walk.
- Good. Done.

157
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:59,106
And there's the one that's proved most effective: Sex.

158
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:08,223
You've got to be kidding me!

159
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:23,440
Good job, Joe! Well done! Top-notch!

160
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:27,169
- You liked it? You really liked it? 
- Oh, yeah!

161
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,644
- Well, which part exactly? 
- The whole thing! Here we go!

162
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:34,214
No, no, no. Give me some specifics.

163
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:38,287
I loved the specifics. 
The specifics were the best part.

164
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:44,087
Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? 
Did you like that part?

165
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:49,733
I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.

166
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:52,896
You fell asleep!

167
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:58,007
There was no kangaroo! 
They didn't take any of my suggestions!

168
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:03,212
- I can't believe you fell asleep. 
- I can't believe it either.

169
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:07,051
Maybe it didn't happen.

170
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:10,222
Maybe you fell asleep and dreamt the whole thing.

171
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:14,422
And this conversation we're having right now is part of that dream.

172
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:16,485
Wake up, Joe!

173
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:26,099
- Thanks for coming. See you later. 
- Don't go. I'm so sorry.

174
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:30,264
Look, this guy fell asleep! 
He fell asleep too! Be mad at him!

175
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,239
Or call an ambulance!

176
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:41,680
What did the doctor say? 
Any news on when the baby will come?

177
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:45,118
No. She gave us ideas on how to induce labor.

178
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:46,688
We tried them all.

179
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:52,353
We went for a walk, we tried tea, castor oil, spicy food. Nothing worked.

180
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:54,893
There is one thing we didn't try.

181
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:59,002
But someone thinks that that will open up a can of worms.

182
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:02,902
If it's gonna help bring the baby here, today...

183
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:05,508
...I think you should do it.

184
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:10,177
- It's sex.
- Do it!

185
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:14,017
- Monica. 
- It's been a really long time for you.

186
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:19,383
I mean, women have needs. 
Do it. Get yours.

187
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,389
Oh, I don't know about that.

188
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:29,759
I think if the two of you had sex, the repercussions would be catastrophic.

189
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:32,795
All right, let's be practical.

190
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:38,839
If Ross isn't willing, he's not the only guy you can have sex with.

191
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:42,272
You could borrow Chandler. Chandler is good.

192
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:47,218
Okay, okay. Yeah, I don't think I wanna do that.

193
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,088
You sure? I'm just saying...

194
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:52,654
...the baby's head isn't getting any smaller.

195
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:58,492
Monica, what is the matter with you?

196
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:02,063
- I just want the baby to be born today. 
- Why today?

197
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:04,830
Okay, fine.

198
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:09,898
I bet Phoebe that you're gonna have the baby, and I don't want to lose.

199
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:15,574
What? While she's been going through this hell, you've been making money?

200
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:20,047
You're betting on your friend staying in this misery?

201
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:25,621
- I'll take that bet.
- What?

202
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:29,658
I'm miserable. I may as well make some money out of it.

203
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:32,056
Can I get some of that action?

204
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,525
I'm betting against all of you?

205
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,633
I really feel like tomorrow it's gonna happen.

206
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:39,495
Okay.

207
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,835
60£¬80£¬100
Sixty, 80, 100.

208
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,036
And 50.

209
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:50,142
And two.

210
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,581
Yeah, baby.

211
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:03,051
Hey, Sleeping Beauty.

212
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:07,254
Where have you been? I want to talk to you. 
I still feel bad.

213
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,900
Oh, no. Were you upset? Did you lose sleep?

214
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,032
I'm so sorry.

215
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:17,605
The reason I came over is to settle things between us. 
You've done a lot for me.

216
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,075
I wanted to pay you back with the premiere, but you missed it.

217
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,473
- So how much do I owe you?
- What?

218
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:27,115
- I don't want to owe you anything. 
- You don't owe me.

219
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,785
- I don't want your... 
- We're doing this!

220
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:32,717
You got me my first headshots. How much?

221
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:37,186
- I don't know, $500.
- Okay, $500. What else?

222
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:41,991
Then there was the second set. 
The infamous "booger" headshots.

223
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:47,128
Okay, so that's another $500. 
That's 500 and 500. That's...

224
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:54,210
- You want a calculator?
- Please.

225
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,072
Here.

226
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,717
All right, what else?

227
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:07,654
Well, there's acting classes, stage-combat classes, tap classes...

228
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:10,623
Which we're still keeping under our hats.

229
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:15,095
That dialect coach who helped you with a Southern accent.

230
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:19,565
Which, after 20 hours of lessons, still came out Jamaican.

231
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:25,773
What the hell are you talking about? 
The South will rise again, man.

232
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,974
Yes, money well-spent.

233
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,207
Okay, what else? Rent.

234
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:37,888
Two, three years of rent, utilities, food...

235
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:42,422
Okay, so I'm writing you a check for...

236
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:49,196
So you fell asleep during my movie. Big deal, right?

237
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,503
How do you clear this thing?

238
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,373
Finish your enchilada.

239
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:02,376
Ross, we've tried all the spicy food. It's not working.

240
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:05,708
Okay, here, have one of these peppers.

241
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:12,856
Oh, God. So hot. Oh, my God.

242
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:18,453
By the way, you don't want to touch the pepper and then touch your eye.

243
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:23,599
I am feeling nothing.

244
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:29,507
Speaking of hot, watching you do that...

245
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:33,199
...really makes me want to have sex with you.

246
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:37,011
- Stop it. 
- Come on! Why are we wasting time?

247
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:41,515
We know it's gonna work.
It's doctor-recommended.

248
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:47,249
I'm sorry. But we have to have some boundaries. 
My God, I'm dying.

249
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:50,291
We've done it before. We'll do it again.

250
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:53,497
It'll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.

251
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:57,131
I'm not gonna make love to you so you'll go into labor.

252
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,768
Make love? What are you, a girl?

253
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:05,568
Always a great way to get into a man's pants.

254
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:10,178
You'll be performing a service. 
Think of me as a ketchup bottle.

255
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:14,819
Sometimes, you have to bang on the end of it to get it to come out.

256
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:18,915
I love when you talk dirty to me.

257
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:24,024
I know it. You're right. That's not sexy.

258
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:30,631
Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork.

259
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,301
Let me just bend over and get it.

260
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:41,912
Oh, God!

261
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:48,115
Okay, enough. This is not going to happen.

262
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,753
Come on, Ross. I'm miserable here.

263
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:54,651
Come on, you started this, now you finish it!

264
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:58,092
Come on, wuss. Make love to me.

265
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:02,723
- You know what?
- What?

266
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:04,933
Forget it.

267
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,965
What now, Ross, you're not gonna talk?

268
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:12,701
How on earth will you ever annoy me?

269
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,912
Oh, wait a minute, I know.

270
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:22,976
You'd think the jalape? 
It would clear up your sinuses, but no!

271
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,689
That's not enough... What are you doing?

272
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,324
I'm getting that baby out of you!

273
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:36,962
- Oh, God!
- I know.

274
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,227
Oh, no, no, no.

275
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:42,700
I think my water just broke.

276
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:45,276
I am good!

277
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:51,114
Okay, I got the pillow. I got the bag.

278
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:53,876
- You got the keys? 
- I got the keys.

279
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,516
We're having a baby.

280
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:18,171
I didn't have time to read this part of the books, but do we have time...?

281
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:21,139
- Not so much.
- Okay, let's go.

282
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:26,676
- 200.
- Thank you.

283
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:30,684
That's it. I don't care when the baby comes. 
No more betting.

284
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,014
Okay.

285
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,451
Hello?

286
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,726
I guess we could bet one more time.

287
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,800
- Is Rachel having the baby? 
- How did you know that?

288
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:53,702
- Joey! Chandler! 
- They're at the coffee house.

289
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,311
You know everything!

290
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:59,675
Wait. I bet you the baby is over 7 pounds.

291
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:04,444
I bet you it has hair! I bet you it's a girl.

292
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:08,251
- We know it's a girl. 
- I'll give you really good odds.
