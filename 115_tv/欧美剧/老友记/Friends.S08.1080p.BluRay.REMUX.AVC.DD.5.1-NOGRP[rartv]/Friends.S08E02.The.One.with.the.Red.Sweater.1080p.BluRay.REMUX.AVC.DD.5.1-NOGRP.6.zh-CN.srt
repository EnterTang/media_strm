1
00:00:01,287 --> 00:00:05,690
听着,先生,我最后一次告诉你 我不在乎电脑上登记了什么
Listen, sir, for the Iast time, I don't care what the computer says.

2
00:00:05,925 --> 00:00:09,156
我们没有从房间冰箱 拿走一包糖果
We did not take a bag of Mashuga Nuts from the minibar.

3
00:00:09,329 --> 00:00:13,095
我们没有看《热心助人的医生》
And we did not watch Dr. Do-Me-A-Little.

4
00:00:15,568 --> 00:00:19,698
-乔伊,昨晚你到过我们房间? -没有
-Joey, were you in our room Iast night? -No.

5
00:00:27,513 --> 00:00:31,347
他们说电影片名 不会出现在帐单上
I was toId the name of the movie wouId not appear on the biII.

6
00:00:32,218 --> 00:00:37,349
-我们要退掉新房了 -没错,我不再是新娘
-We're checking out of the bridaI suite. -That's right, I'm no Ionger a bride.

7
00:00:37,557 --> 00:00:41,789
我永远都当不了新娘 现在我是某人的太太
I'II never be a bride again. Now I'm just someone's wife.

8
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:46,096
现在我是全世界最快乐的男人
And I'm the happiest guy in the worId.

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,601
甜心,别难过 我们还是有很光明的未来
Honey, don't be upset. We stiII have so much to Iook forward to.

10
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,169
对
Yeah, right.

11
00:00:52,338 --> 00:00:55,364
-我们还要去度蜜月 -那是星期四的事
-We got the honeymoon. -That's not tiII Thursday.

12
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:58,032
-还有婚纱照 -那得等上好几个星期
-The wedding pictures. -It won't be ready for weeks.

13
00:00:58,211 --> 00:01:00,771
但婚宴上用即可拍 拍的照片马上可以洗好
Not the disposabIe cameras from the tabIes.

14
00:01:00,947 --> 00:01:04,041
没错 我就知道我嫁给你是有原因的
That's true. I knew I married you for a reason!

15
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:08,281
听着,我拿照片去洗 你先回家吧
TeII you what, I wiII go get them deveIoped, and you can go home.

16
00:01:11,657 --> 00:01:15,024
-什么?你拍了什么? -没什么
-What? What did you take a picture of? -Nothing.

17
00:01:15,194 --> 00:01:16,855
一定很精彩
It was something.

18
00:01:17,964 --> 00:01:20,626
即可拍在罗斯那里 他还没有退房吗?
Ross has the cameras. Has he checked out yet?

19
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,031
你在开玩笑吗? 退房时间是中午
Are you joking? Checkout is not tiII noon.

20
00:01:24,203 --> 00:01:28,469
-他还有11分钟 -所以呢?
-And he has a good 1 1 minutes Ieft. -So?

21
00:01:28,641 --> 00:01:31,940
罗斯从来不会 提早退房
So Ross had never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.

22
00:01:32,145 --> 00:01:34,943
我们在交往的时候 有一次延后退房
One time, when we were dating, we got a Iate checkout.

23
00:01:35,114 --> 00:01:38,550
他非常兴奋 那是我们最棒的性经验
He got so excited, it was the best sex we ever had.

24
00:01:38,885 --> 00:01:42,412
直到他最后 大叫着“拉迪森”
UntiI he screamed out ''Radisson'' at the end.

25
00:01:43,723 --> 00:01:48,023
好吧,我去找罗斯拿照相机 然后把底片拿去洗
Okay, weII, I'm gonna get Ross, get the cameras and get them deveIoped.

26
00:01:49,929 --> 00:01:52,762
乔伊,你32岁了
32, Joe. You're 32!

27
00:01:55,134 --> 00:01:57,568
-这是你的帐单 -谢谢
-Here's a copy of your biII. -Thanks.

28
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:01,133
香槟,草莓…
Champagne, strawberries....

29
00:02:01,707 --> 00:02:06,872
天啊,我不敢相信 钱德在我们的新婚之夜看黄色电影
Oh, my God! I can't beIieve ChandIer ordered porn on our wedding night.

30
00:02:08,681 --> 00:02:12,549
对,那真的很惨 糖果?
Yeah, that's sad. Mashuga Nut?

31
00:02:13,953 --> 00:02:16,114
片名:六人行 红色毛衣

32
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,000

40
00:02:55,895 --> 00:02:57,157
是我
It's me.

41
00:03:02,068 --> 00:03:05,629
肥皂,洗发精 你真的要这些东西带走?
Soaps, shampoos. Are you reaIIy taking aII this stuff?

42
00:03:05,805 --> 00:03:08,831
为什么不行? 这全包含在房费里
Why not? It's buiIt into the price of the room.

43
00:03:09,142 --> 00:03:12,737
对,但你不需要… 这是什么?
Yeah, but you don't need-- What is this?

44
00:03:12,912 --> 00:03:14,641
针线包
Thread.

45
00:03:15,882 --> 00:03:17,474
答对了
Score!

46
00:03:18,484 --> 00:03:21,920
-即可拍在哪里? -什么即可拍?
-Where are the disposabIe cameras? -What cameras?

47
00:03:22,088 --> 00:03:25,023
-昨晚我把它们交给你 -才没有
-Last night I asked you to take them. -No, you didn't.

48
00:03:25,224 --> 00:03:28,523
就是有,记得吗? 在切蛋糕前我说…
Yes, remember? Right before we cut the cake, I said--

49
00:03:28,694 --> 00:03:31,185
对,你问我 能不能帮你一个忙
Yeah, you asked me if I couId do you a favor.

50
00:03:31,364 --> 00:03:33,730
这时墨瑞叔叔走过来 交给你一张支票
Then my UncIe Murray came up to you and handed you a check.

51
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,889
制片:温蒂诺勒
Then you said, ''Why is it caIIed a check? Why not a YugosIavian?''

52
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:37,001
然后你说“它为什么叫做支票? 为什么不叫南斯拉夫人?”

53
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,159
编剧:戴娜克莱恩布考

54
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:46,038
然后你那么做 墨瑞叔叔这样看着我
Then you did that, and my UncIe Murray Iooked at me Iike:

55
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,071
-即可拍不在你手上? -没错,抱歉
-So you don't have the cameras? -No, sorry.

56
00:03:50,249 --> 00:03:52,945
什么?相机不见了? 摩妮卡会气疯的
So, what? They're gone? Monica's gonna freak!

57
00:03:53,152 --> 00:03:54,847
我相信它们应该就在某个地方 我帮你找
I'm sure they're here somewhere. I'II heIp you Iook.

58
00:03:55,054 --> 00:03:55,986
导演:大卫修蒙
-Great. -In three minutes.

59
00:03:56,222 --> 00:03:58,383
-太棒了 -再等三分钟

60
00:04:17,143 --> 00:04:19,475
你要丢下钱德 自己拆礼物?
Are you gonna open the presents without ChandIer?

61
00:04:19,645 --> 00:04:22,671
不,我只是…
No! I'm just....

62
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:28,910
它们在呼换我 这个小家伙甚至爬到我的膝盖上
They're caIIing out to me. This IittIe guy even crawIed up in my Iap.

63
00:04:29,322 --> 00:04:34,089
钱德不会介意我拆开一样礼物 你觉得它是什么?
ChandIer wouIdn't mind if I opened just one present. What do you think it is?

64
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,457
是一面小镜子 只要你一照它…
A IittIe mirror that, when you Iook into it...

65
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,428
你会发现自己变成了老太婆
...you see yourseIf as an oId woman.

66
00:04:42,635 --> 00:04:44,865
是一个迷你盐罐
A tiny saIt shaker!

67
00:04:45,037 --> 00:04:48,939
天啊,是用来装迷你盐的
Oh, my God, for tiny saIt!

68
00:04:49,108 --> 00:04:53,272
好吧,那真的很好玩 很好玩
Oh, wow! Okay. WeII, that was fun. That was fun.

69
00:04:53,446 --> 00:04:56,779
我会等钱德 一起拆开其他礼物
Okay, I'II just wait for ChandIer to open up the rest of them.

70
00:04:58,417 --> 00:05:03,855
但这只是调味瓶组的 一部份
AIthough, you know, this is part of a saIt-and-pepper set.

71
00:05:04,223 --> 00:05:07,590
或许它只算半项礼物 你觉得呢?
It may just count as onIy haIf a present. What do you think?

72
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,129
我猜如果它是一套的,再拆开一样 应该没关系,或许是这个
I guess it's okay to open one more if it's part of a set. It's probabIy this one.

73
00:05:12,298 --> 00:05:14,061
或是这个
Or this one!

74
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:21,868
-你好吗?会害喜吗? -男生们还不知道吧?
-How are you? Got any morning sickness? -The guys don't know yet, do they?

75
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:25,533
乔伊跟罗斯什么都不知道 钱德认为是菲比怀孕了
Joey and Ross don't know anything. ChandIer thinks Phoebe's pregnant.

76
00:05:25,711 --> 00:05:28,874
没错 钱德还是以为我怀孕了
That's right. ChandIer does stiII think I'm pregnant.

77
00:05:29,348 --> 00:05:33,182
他没有问我感觉如何 也没有帮我提袋子
He hasn't asked me how I'm feeIing or offered to carry my bags.

78
00:05:33,386 --> 00:05:36,685
我为跟他在一起的女人 觉得难过
I feeI bad for the woman who ends up with him.

79
00:05:38,157 --> 00:05:40,785
我是指在你之后的女人
After you, of course.

80
00:05:40,993 --> 00:05:44,451
别担心,你只需要 再假装怀孕几小时…
Don't worry. You onIy have to be pregnant for a few more hours...

81
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,564
因为今天我要告诉孩子的爸
...because I'm teIIing the father today.

82
00:05:46,732 --> 00:05:49,758
他就住在这栋公寓吗? 是一楼那个高个貌吗?
Is it someone in the buiIding? That taII guy on the first fIoor?

83
00:05:49,935 --> 00:05:53,701
-不 -什么?我觉得他很可爱
-No! -What? I think he's cute.

84
00:05:53,873 --> 00:05:57,206
-那么你可以去怀他的孩子 -相信我,我正在努力
-Then you have his baby. -BeIieve me, I'm trying.

85
00:05:58,544 --> 00:06:01,911
这真的好奇怪 你今天要告诉这个男人…
It's so weird. You're gonna teII this guy today...

86
00:06:02,081 --> 00:06:04,675
他不知道 会发生什么事
...and he has no idea what's gonna happen.

87
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:09,844
你要敲敲他的门 永远地改变他的一生
You're just gonna knock on his door and change his Iife forever.

88
00:06:10,056 --> 00:06:13,492
你就像艾德麦马汉 只不过手上没有拿大额支票
You're Iike Ed McMahon, except without the big check.

89
00:06:13,859 --> 00:06:16,453
也没有原始的性吸引力
Or the raw sexuaI magnetism.

90
00:06:18,064 --> 00:06:21,329
对,我猜 那是个大消息
Yeah, weII, I guess it is pretty big news.

91
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,799
大消息?它是超级大消息 天啊,这个男人什么都不知道
Pretty big? It's huge! God, this guy doesn't have a cIue.

92
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:29,930
他走在街上心想 “我跟瑞秋葛林做爱,太帅了”
He's just waIking down the street thinking, ''I had sex with RacheI Greene. I rock!''

93
00:06:30,142 --> 00:06:33,543
然后,碰,他当了爸爸 一切都不一样了
Then, bam! He's a father, everything's different.

94
00:06:33,713 --> 00:06:37,877
除非他真的想当爸爸 我不会对他提出任何要求
It's onIy different if he wants it to be. I'm not gonna ask him for anything.

95
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,109
他还是得做出 重大的决定
He stiII has this huge decision to make.

96
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,346
现在他边走边想 “我要当爸爸吗?”然后,碰
Now he's waIking around thinking, ''Do I want to be a dad?'' Then, bam!

97
00:06:44,557 --> 00:06:46,320
这次怎么了?
What was that ''bam''?

98
00:06:46,492 --> 00:06:50,189
我不知道 他可能是撞上巴士了
I don't know. He's hit by a bus, or something.

99
00:06:52,565 --> 00:06:57,969
乔伊,如果跟你上过床的女人 告诉你她怀孕了,你会怎么办?
Joey, what wouId you do if someone you sIept with toId you she was pregnant?

100
00:07:04,243 --> 00:07:05,972
谁打电话到这里来?
Who caIIed here?

101
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,940
她听起来像金发美女吗?她有口音吗? 我得去打个电话
Did she sound bIond? Did she have an accent? I gotta make a caII.

102
00:07:12,151 --> 00:07:15,120
我不该到 那家太阳眼镜专卖店的
ShouId have never waIked into that SungIass Hut!

103
00:07:16,188 --> 00:07:19,282
不是你 你没有让任何人怀孕
It's not you! You didn't get anybody pregnant.

104
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:23,994
你为什么要那样子吓我? 发生了什么事?
Why wouId you scare me Iike that? What the heII's going on?

105
00:07:26,098 --> 00:07:28,498
有人怀孕了吗?
Is somebody pregnant?

106
00:07:29,635 --> 00:07:31,500
对,我怀孕了
Oh, yeah! That's me.

107
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:36,897
天啊,菲比 你要生孩子了?
Oh, my God, Pheebs! You're gonna have a baby?

108
00:07:37,076 --> 00:07:41,945
对 天啊,我要生孩子了
Yes, I am. Oh, my God, I'm gonna have a baby!

109
00:07:42,882 --> 00:07:45,783
-等一下,孩子的爸是谁? -你不认识他
-Wait a minute, who's the father? -You don't know him.

110
00:07:45,985 --> 00:07:50,445
那不重要 他不希望跟我或孩子扯上关系
It's not important. He wants nothing to do with me or the baby.

111
00:07:53,826 --> 00:07:58,991
这家伙是谁? 因为我要把他找出来,痛扁他一顿
Who is this guy? Because I wiII track him down and kick his ass!

112
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:02,597
-大卫林恩 -大卫林恩
-David Linn. -David Linn!

113
00:08:06,138 --> 00:08:10,131
-谁是大卫林恩? -我在健身房认识的人,他很讨厌
-Who's David Linn? -Some guy from my gym. LittIe annoying.

114
00:08:15,614 --> 00:08:18,742
-钱德 -你找到即可拍了吗?
-ChandIer? -Did you find the cameras?

115
00:08:18,984 --> 00:08:20,645
-没有,你呢? -我找到了
-No. Did you? -Yes.

116
00:08:20,853 --> 00:08:23,845
那就是我躲在桌下的原因 我想要庆祝
That's why I'm under the tabIe, ceIebrating.

117
00:08:24,757 --> 00:08:29,057
我去失物中心问过管理员 没有人捡到即可拍
I checked in the Iost and found. I taIked to the manager. No one's turned them in.

118
00:08:29,228 --> 00:08:34,165
太棒了,今天只有那些即可拍 能让摩妮卡打起精神来
Great. Those cameras were the onIy thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today.

119
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:37,131
你们刚刚结婚 她为什么要心情不好?
You just got married. Why is she so depressed?

120
00:08:37,303 --> 00:08:41,637
我没有力气 问她那个问题
AII my energy is going into not asking that question.

121
00:08:41,807 --> 00:08:45,868
-我不敢相信我搞砸了 -我很遗憾,兄弟
-I can't beIieve I screwed this up! -I'm sorry, man.

122
00:08:48,113 --> 00:08:52,140
我有个点子 你们在这个宴会厅请客
Here's a thought. This is the same baIIroom.

123
00:08:52,351 --> 00:08:55,809
这里有乐队 等一下会有很多人盛装前来
There's a band. There's gonna be pIenty of dressed-up peopIe.

124
00:08:56,021 --> 00:08:59,081
你建议 我们可以丢下问题不管?
Are you suggesting we dance our troubIes away?

125
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:02,920
不,我是说我们到礼品店 买一些即可拍…
No, I'm saying we buy more of these at the gift shop...

126
00:09:03,095 --> 00:09:05,620
换上礼服 拍几张照片
...throw our tuxes back on and take a few pictures.

127
00:09:05,798 --> 00:09:08,733
我们只要 不拍到任何人的脸
We just have to make sure not to get anybody's faces.

128
00:09:08,901 --> 00:09:10,391
你是认真的吗?
Are you serious?

129
00:09:10,569 --> 00:09:12,935
我想到 在家等你的新娘
I'm thinking about your new bride at home.

130
00:09:13,105 --> 00:09:16,268
你想在你们共度一生的第一天 就让她失望吗?
Do you want to start your Iife together by Ietting her down?

131
00:09:16,442 --> 00:09:19,502
你真的要给我关于婚姻的建议?
Marriage advice? ReaIIy?

132
00:09:21,514 --> 00:09:24,642
我是在告诉你 这看起来很像你的婚宴
I'm teIIing you, this Iooks exactIy Iike your wedding.

133
00:09:24,817 --> 00:09:28,014
-这些花都一样吧? -我不知道,花是摩妮卡挑的
-Aren't these the same fIowers? -I don't know. Monica picked them.

134
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,313
-椅子呢? -也是
-What about the chairs? -Those too.

135
00:09:30,523 --> 00:09:32,286
-布置呢? -她挑的
-The pIace settings? -Her.

136
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:35,621
-你做了什么? -我负责看好照相机
-What did you do? -I was in charge of the cameras.

137
00:09:35,794 --> 00:09:37,523
礼品店?
Gift shop?

138
00:09:43,335 --> 00:09:46,634
-你说了吗? -还没有
-Did you do it yet? -Not yet.

139
00:09:46,805 --> 00:09:50,536
那么你在这里做什么? 你真的要说吗?
Then what are you doing here? Are you about to do it?

140
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:52,540
是阿甘吗?
Is it Gunther?

141
00:09:54,547 --> 00:09:58,881
-不是阿甘 -谢天谢地,还好宝宝不会有他的头发
-It's not Gunther! -Thank God. Because that hair on a baby?

142
00:10:00,452 --> 00:10:03,819
孩子的爸不在这里,好吗? 我还没有告诉他
The father is not here, okay? I haven't toId him yet.

143
00:10:03,989 --> 00:10:07,425
-我想现在我没办法告诉他 -为什么?
-I don't think I can teII him at aII now. -Why not?

144
00:10:07,593 --> 00:10:13,327
我在街上边走边想 “我要告诉孩子的爸”,然后,碰
I was waIking down the street, thinking, ''I'm gonna teII the father.'' And then, bam!

145
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,024
你撞到了巴士?
Bus?

146
00:10:17,136 --> 00:10:22,438
不,是你,你吓了我一跳 你一直在提醒我这是件大事
No, you! You freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this aII is.

147
00:10:22,608 --> 00:10:23,939
但它的确是件大事
But it is huge.

148
00:10:24,109 --> 00:10:27,545
我知道,我只是在想 它对我来说有多重要
I know. But I was just thinking about how huge it was for me.

149
00:10:27,713 --> 00:10:30,580
我根本不知道 这对孩子的爸来说有多重要
I didn't even go to how huge it'II be for the father.

150
00:10:30,749 --> 00:10:35,311
你想太多了 告诉他,把事情做个了断
You're thinking about this way too much. Just teII him and get it over with.

151
00:10:35,521 --> 00:10:39,753
它就像撕掉OK绷一样 越快越不痛,你看
It's Iike ripping off this Band-Aid, quick and painIess. Watch.

152
00:10:39,925 --> 00:10:41,825
天杀的…
Oh, mother of--!

153
00:10:44,196 --> 00:10:45,823
看吧?
See?

154
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:56,503
-我们要拆礼物了吗? -不,我根本不该拆开礼物
-Are we opening presents? -No. I shouIdn't have even opened these.

155
00:10:56,976 --> 00:11:01,675
乔伊,我控制不了自己 你得帮我一个忙
Joey, I am out of controI! You have to do me a favor.

156
00:11:01,847 --> 00:11:04,179
不论我说什么 不论我做什么…
No matter what I say, no matter what I do...

157
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:07,410
拜,不要让我 再拆开任何礼物,好吗?
...pIease, do not Iet me open another present. Okay?

158
00:11:10,823 --> 00:11:12,654
再给我一个礼物
Give me one more.

159
00:11:15,995 --> 00:11:19,954
很好,你来了 菲比,听我说…
Oh, good, you're here. Pheebs? Listen....

160
00:11:20,232 --> 00:11:23,759
-坐下,我要告诉你一件事 -好吧
-Sit down, I got something I wanna say. -AII right.

161
00:11:30,676 --> 00:11:36,137
外面的世界很可怕 特别是对单亲妈妈来说
It's a scary worId out there, especiaIIy for a singIe mom.

162
00:11:36,348 --> 00:11:40,114
我一直觉得 我跟你之间很特别
I've aIways feIt that you and I have a speciaI bond.

163
00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:41,786
所以…
So....

164
00:11:43,522 --> 00:11:46,685
菲比布非,你愿意嫁给我吗?
Phoebe Buffay, wiII you marry me?

165
00:11:50,496 --> 00:11:52,589
我的天啊

166
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,291
我愿意嫁给你
Oh, yeah, I'II marry you.

167
00:11:58,804 --> 00:12:03,366
-你不能嫁给他 -小姐,你结过婚了,这次轮到我
-You can't marry him! -Hey, Iady, your day's over. It's my turn.

168
00:12:04,576 --> 00:12:07,977
-她为什么不能嫁给我? -我可以,我也愿意
-Why can't she marry me? -I can and I wiII.

169
00:12:09,815 --> 00:12:14,149
她没有怀孕 是瑞秋怀孕了
She's not pregnant. RacheI's the one who's pregnant.

170
00:12:14,353 --> 00:12:16,253
天啊
Oh, my God!

171
00:12:17,022 --> 00:12:19,752
九个月后你生不出孩子 他会发现的
He'd notice when you didn't have a baby in nine months!

172
00:12:19,925 --> 00:12:21,950
他是乔伊
It's Joey!

173

我爱你
I love you.

Wait, I can't beIieve it! RacheI's pregnant? Who's the father?

175

We don't know.

176
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,942
-不知道是不是那个家伙 -哪个家伙?
-I wonder if it's that dude. -There's a dude?

177

是谁呢?
Who is it?

178
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:43,976
大约一个月前 这家伙跟瑞秋共度春宵
About a month ago this guy spent the night with RacheI.

179
00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:46,617
我没有看到他,但是…
I didn't see who it was, but....

180
00:12:52,157 --> 00:12:54,125
他把故事说完了吗?
Was that story over?

181
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,998
那个家伙留下这个
The guy Ieft this.

182

对,我会帮你们拍照
Oh, yeah. I'II take your picture.

195
00:14:03,128 --> 00:14:05,358
你的手指挡到镜头了
Your finger was covering the Iens.

196
00:14:05,497 --> 00:14:08,489
你是安瑟亚当斯吗? 快滚吧
Who are you, AnseI Adams? Get out of here!

197
00:14:09,802 --> 00:14:12,032
(中央咖啡厅)

Look, I feeI reaIIy bad about how I freaked you out before...

199
00:14:16,775 --> 00:14:19,938
所以我请孩子的爸到里面等你 你可以告诉他事实
...so I asked the father to meet you here so you couId teII him.

200
00:14:20,145 --> 00:14:24,172
什么?等一下 你怎么知道孩子的爸是谁?
What? Wait a minute. How do you even know who the father is?

201
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:27,613
或许有时候我傻傻的…
I may pIay the fooI at times...

202
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:32,382
但事实上我是个勇不放弃的 金发美女
...but I'm more than a pretty bIond girI with an ass that won't quit.

203
00:14:34,059 --> 00:14:37,586
我相信 这是孩子爸的衣服…
I beIieve this beIongs to the father of your baby...

204
00:14:37,763 --> 00:14:42,860
天啊,他就在里面?
Oh, God. He's in there right now?

205
00:14:43,035 --> 00:14:48,871
你可以转身离开或是长痛不如短痛 你打算怎么做?
You can turn around, or you can go rip the Band-Aid off. What do you want to do?

206
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:52,601

Why don't you go up on-stage. I'II get a picture of you doing the speech.

WiII the owner of a 1 995 Buick LeSabre pIease see the front desk?

这是怎么一回事?
So, what's this about?

220
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,525
瑞秋有事 要告诉你
RacheI has something she wants to teII you.

221
00:16:24,703 --> 00:16:28,969
我相信 这是你的红毛衣

227
00:16:50,395 --> 00:16:54,764
没事 菲比弄错了
Nothing. Phoebe kind of made a mistake.

228
00:16:55,067 --> 00:17:00,130
但你的确常穿那件毛衣 你在做什么冒险的事吗?
But you do wear that sweater a Iot. Are you invoIved in some kind of dare?

229
00:17:00,739 --> 00:17:04,072
事实上我很高兴能接到菲比的电话
I'm actuaIIy gIad Phoebe caIIed.

230
00:17:08,814 --> 00:17:12,545

I know we broke up because you thought I was immature, but I've grown up.

231

我想我们应该复合
I think we shouId get back together.

232
00:17:15,287 --> 00:17:17,812
时机不对

时机非常恰当 我做了万全的准备

你拆开了我爸妈的礼物
You got my parents' gift.

241
00:17:58,897 --> 00:18:02,697
-那是什么? -应该是跟义大利腊肠有关的东西
-What is that? -I think it does something to saIami.

242
00:18:06,838 --> 00:18:09,238
-情况如何? -泰格怎么说?
-How'd it go? -What did Tag say?

243
00:18:09,408 --> 00:18:12,809
泰格不是孩子的爸 乔伊知道了?
Tag is not the father. And Joey knows now?

244
00:18:12,978 --> 00:18:16,937
我知道了,瑞秋 我为你感到高兴

-是吗? -不,听着…
-I'm not? -No. Listen....

249

外面的世界很可怕 特别是对单亲妈妈来说
It's a scary worId out there, especiaIIy for a singIe mom.

What? I proposed to you. It baIances out.

259
00:19:36,928 --> 00:19:39,089
我不能说我不心痛

260
00:19:41,133 --> 00:19:43,533
但我会原谅你,乔伊崔比亚尼

We're hanging in the kitchen. Let's stay in the kitchen.

我没想到这一点
Didn't see that coming.

273
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,440
这不是 我们第一次接吻的照片…
So this isn't a picture of our first kiss...
