1
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:07,196
Phoebe. Will you check out that guy by the window.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,002
That guy back there? He's awfully short. 
And I think he's talking to himself.

3
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:14,840
And to be completely honest, he's not that good in bed.

4
00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:17,716
Really?

5
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:22,116
What is wrong with me lately? 
It's like, every guy I see.

6
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:24,187
I mean, look at that guy, for example.

7
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:27,224
That's not someone I would be attracted to.

8
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,392
But right now, with the way I'm feeling...

9
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:33,623
...all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.

10
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,792
Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?

11
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,869
- Yeah. 
- This is completely normal.

12
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:42,371
Around the fourth month, your hormones start going crazy.

13
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:45,702
- Really? So this has happened to you? 
- Absolutely!

14
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:48,105
And keep in mind now, I was carrying triplets.

15
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:52,476
So in medical terms, I was thrice as randy.

16
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:55,251
Wow, this explains so much!

17
00:00:55,522 --> 00:01:00,118
Last weekend, I went from store to store, sitting on Santas' laps.

18
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:04,122
Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout...

19
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,265
...of Evander Holyfield from a Foot Locker.

20
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:11,636
Well, I go see my doctor tomorrow. I'll ask her about this.

21
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:13,634
Maybe she can give me a pill or something.

22
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:16,205
Yeah, that's what you need. A good pill.

23
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:23,616
Oh, no. Short, crazy guy recognizes me. Worst mistake of my life.

24
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:26,611
Call me.

25
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:36,827
The One With The Creepy Holiday Card

28
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,327
I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.

29
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:11,691
Great. Hey, Joey, want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice-skating?

30
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:17,966
Ordinarily, I would love to, but I am just swamped right now.

31
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:25,666
Where are the pictures that that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?

32
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:28,277
Oh, yeah. Probably at the end.

33
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:32,483
Oh, my God! All he took were pictures of my breasts.

34
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:34,277
I'm missing picture time!

35
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:42,251
You know, she has a face, Ross.

36
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:47,424
I didn't take these, okay? 
I didn't even know my camera had a zoom lens.

37
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,499
"Comma, officer."

38
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:54,303
- Okay, here's a good one of us.
- Wow, that is a good one!

39
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:56,234
It looks like a holiday card.

40
00:02:56,442 --> 00:03:00,344
With the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.

41
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,879
Good job, pretzel pervert.

42
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,175
Every year, I say I'm gonna send out holiday cards and I never do it.

43
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,752
Do you want to send this one out together?

44
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:16,056
Together? Like, to people?

45
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:20,595
Yeah. "Happy holidays, from Mona and Ross. " lt'll be cute, okay?

46
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,663
Okay.

47
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:25,529
- I gotta get to work. Call me later? 
- Sure, sure.

48
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:27,829
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

49
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:33,176
Congratulations! You just got married!

50
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:35,944
I know. Can you believe that?

51
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:38,878
I'm sorry. What's the big deal about a holiday card?

52
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:42,417
Married couples send out cards. 
Families send out cards.

53
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:45,886
People who have been dating for a couple of months don't send out cards.

54
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:49,323
- What is she, crazy? 
- That's your wife you're talking about!

55
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:54,294
No, really. I mean, that would be like a huge step forward.

56
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,627
I like things just the way they are.

57
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:59,464
I'm finally in a relationship that's not moving too fast.

58
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:03,301
You know, ordinarily, I'd be divorced by now.

59
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:07,172
Okay, so just tell her you don't wanna send out the card. What's she gonna do?

60
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,574
This.

61
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:12,411
Oh, okay. I didn't mean to put pressure on you...

62
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:15,611
...I just thought it would be something fun for us to do together...

63
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:18,484
...but okay, that's okay.

64
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,497
Okay, stop. Stop. You're right, it's not that big a deal. I'll do the card.

65
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:32,127
- What? I said I'd do it. 
- I know, it's just...

66
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:34,033
Can I have $20?

67
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:46,412
- Hi. You ready for lunch?
- One second.

68
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:54,052
- That's cute.
- Bing! And the Bingette!

69
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,785
I thought it felt a little hotter in the office today.

70
00:04:57,363 --> 00:05:01,094
- Oh, honey, you remember my boss, Doug. 
- Yes. Hi.

71
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,395
Good news! The divorce is final. I signed the papers this a. M.

72
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,867
I didn't know you and Kara divorced. I'm sorry.

73
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:10,200
Sorry? I finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap.

74
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,812
- Congratulations to you guys, though. 
- No leg-chewing for us, sir.

75
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,279
Well, give it time.

76
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:22,619
So the divorce, the marriage, we got a lot to celebrate.

77
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:25,449
How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night.

78
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:28,226
I can't think of anything we're doing.

79
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:31,225
Why can't I think of anything we're doing?

80
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:33,830
Tomorrow night it is. I should be out of court by 6.

81
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:36,363
They keep throwing sexual harassment cases at me...

82
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:39,163
...and I keep knocking them out of the park!

83
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:41,430
Okay, see you tomorrow.

84
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,108
Just so you know, we're not seeing him tomorrow.

85
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:47,602
Honey, once you get to know him, he's much, much worse.

86
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,145
I can't do this alone.

87
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:53,550
Honey, I'm sorry. I can't help you. 
I can't spend another evening with that man.

88
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,280
Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?

89
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:58,582
That's because he wasn't invited.

90
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,292
Because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.

91
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:05,520
Oh, yeah! Urine cuts right through an ice sculpture, doesn't it?

92
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,905
Oh, what the hell? B plus.

93
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,982
Hi! I went by the photo shop. Take a look.

94
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:33,589
Here is a mockup of our card. What do you think?

95
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:38,563
Wow, that's great.

96
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:42,196
Do you think it should say, "Love, Ross and Mona"?

97
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:46,469
Well, we haven't said that to each other yet...

98
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,366
...but I guess it's okay to say it to other people.

99
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:54,478
- How many did you want? I'll get 100. 
- A hundred?

100
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:59,742
Well, I guess I'll take...

101
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,886
Mona?

102
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:07,756
I'm not sure about the whole card thing.

103
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,392
Really? Why not?

104
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:13,960
Sending out a holiday card together?

105
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:18,727
I just don't know if we're really quite there yet.

106
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,699
I didn't think of it that way. You're right.

107
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,238
- So can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

108
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,110
Where are we?

109
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:36,854
You know, where are we? 
Where is this relationship going?

110
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:47,262
I love spending time with you. 
I just hope we're moving forward.

111
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:50,696
We should talk about that, don't you think?

112
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,104
Let's do the card!

113
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:05,214
- What? 
- The card! I think we're there!

114
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,886
Okay. But I still think we should have this conversation.

115
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,850
Really?

116
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,955
Even with the card?

117
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:24,130
Just so you know, Dr. Long can't be here today, so Dr. Schiff will be seeing you.

118
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,567
Oh, okay. Can I ask you a question?

119
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,140
Was it me, or was the guy who took my blood sample really cute?

120
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:36,745
You know who I'm talking about? 
Bowl haircut, hairy fingers?

121
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:41,215
Actually, never mind. I just answered my own question.

122
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:46,417
- Hi, Rachel? I'm Dr. Schiff. 
- Yes, you are.

123
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:50,123
- Okay, now he's cute, right? 
- Oh, God, yes.

124
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,654
So, how's it going?

125
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:56,391
It's going really good. But enough about me! Come on.

126
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:58,831
Where are you from? What do you do?

127
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,803
- I'm a doctor.
- Right. I meant...

128
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,876
...in your spare time. Do you cook? So you ski?

129
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:09,137
Or just hang out with your wife, or girlfriend?

130
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:12,475
I don't have a wife or a girlfriend, but I do like to ski.

131
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:16,779
I love to ski! How amazing is this?

132
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:21,789
- Are you experiencing any discomfort? 
- No, I'm very comfortable.

133
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:25,429
- Any painful gas?
- No!

134
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:30,764
Dr. Schiff! What kind of question is that?

135
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,337
Okay, then. Would you like to lie down on the table?

136
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,202
Would you like me to lie down on the table?

137
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:41,610
- Is there something going on here? 
- Do you feel it too?

138
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:49,445
- Hi.
- How did your doctor's appointment go?

139
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:53,624
Well, let's see, they gave me "cute boy" doctor today.

140
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:57,852
In the middle of the exam, I put my pinkie in his chin dimple.

141
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,224
- Oh, my God! 
- Why did you do that?

142
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,197
Remember that little problem I was having during my fourth month of pregnancy?

143
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,100
Oh, yeah! The Evander Holyfield phase.

144
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:12,277
Oh, man! You were so hard up, you practically came on to me.

145
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,638
You wish.

146
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:16,978
Hey, I could have had you if I wanted you.

147
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:20,685
Oh, yeah? Come and get it.

148
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:26,124
Okay, even this is turning me on. You guys, I got problems.

149
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,853
Oh, hey. Hey, Ross! How's it going with you and Mona?

150
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:34,226
Are you guys still together?

151
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:39,001
Yeah, we're moving forward. You'll be getting our card.

152
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,807
You're doing a holiday card?

153
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:45,168
We're not just doing a card. She also wants to have the conversation...

154
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:47,276
...about where the relationship is going.

155
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,377
Women!

156
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:53,575
I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?

157
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:57,244
No self-respecting man would ask a woman, "So where is this going?"

158
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:59,150
Ross, you asked me that.

159
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:04,056
You were a closed book, okay? 
I'm not a mind reader!

160
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:08,223
What are you gonna say to her? 
Where is this relationship going?

161
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:12,565
I don't know. I really like her and I wanna keep dating her.

162
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,865
- So tell her that.
- No, I can't.

163
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:18,009
Because then she's gonna say, "Well, it's not moving anywhere...

164
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:21,111
- then we should just break up." 
- Yeah, that's true.

165
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:27,783
Besides, I hate those conversations. I'm horrible at them. Really.

166
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:30,512
Maybe I need some kind of a gesture...

167
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:34,123
...something that says we're moving forward without having to talk about it.

168
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,726
Like asking her to move in with you?

169
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,827
Smaller than that.

170
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:42,462
- Making her a mix tape?
- Bigger than that.

171
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:47,502
- Give her a key to your apartment. 
- We were closer with the mix tape.

172
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,038
Have you said, "I love you"? You could say, "I love you."

173
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:53,142
I don't think I'm quite there yet.

174
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:56,745
But I could say, "I love spending time with you."

175
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:59,450
- We hate that. 
- That is a slap in the face.

176
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:04,316
Forget it. You know what? I'll just have the conversation.

177
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:09,492
I'll just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best.

178
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,724
What do you think, Rach?

179
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:15,125
I think if it was a little colder in here...

180
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:17,835
...I could see your nipples through that sweater.

181
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:25,541
Bing? We're all set for tonight, 8:00.

182
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:28,245
As it turns out, we can't do it. 
Monica has to work.

183
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,982
My ex-wife didn't work.

184
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:34,516
Unless you call turning into her mother "work."

185
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:38,055
Fine. Tomorrow night then.

186
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:41,818
- Tomorrow's no good for her, either. 
- Why not?

187
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,953
It's the semifinals...

188
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:49,292
...of her bocce ball tournament.

189
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,470
Okay. The night after that then.

190
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:55,129
Well, that's the finals, and I think she's gonna go all the way, sir.

191
00:12:56,108 --> 00:13:02,047
What's going on, Bing? 
Does your wife have a problem with me or something?

192
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,749
Well, now you're just talking crazy.

193
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:07,612
Then why can't the three of us go out together?

194
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,855
Because we split up.

195
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,057
Monica and I split up.

196
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:15,149
Hold me.

197
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:20,927
Good God, Bing. Well, I can't say I'm altogether surprised.

198
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,103
I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there.

199
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:30,906
And the way she looked at me, pure lust.

200
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:35,477
What would really help me through this tough time is choking someone.

201
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:38,646
I know how you feel. Oh, yeah.

202
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,910
I know what it's like to give a woman all your love...

203
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,645
...and then have that love thrown back in your face.

204
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:49,021
And then the court decides to give you custody of those fat, left-handed twins.

205
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:54,064
Well, they're lucky to have you, sir.

206
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,728
Bing, my boy, we're gonna get you over this.

207
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:01,439
Here's the plan: Grab your coat, we're going to a strip club!

208
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:04,505
Oh, no! Monica would freak.

209
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:07,936
But to hell with that bitch!

210
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:12,710
Here we go.

211
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:19,582
Mona, it's time we had a conversation about where things are with us.

212
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:23,295
Yeah, I think I suggested that.

213
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:26,022
We are so...

214
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:36,540
Well, I really like you. And I love hanging out with you.

215
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:40,836
And I'm having a lot of fun.

216
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,707
Okay.

217
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:51,514
There's no point in spending time with someone if it's just fun.

218
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,726
It's gotta be going somewhere, right?

219
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,896
So where is it going?

220
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:07,632
That's the real question.

221
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:13,539
And the answer is...

222
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:17,180
...it's going somewhere...

223
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,543
...fun.

224
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:25,580
I know what you're thinking. 
Fun was fine for you 10 years ago.

225
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:29,157
But you're not getting any younger.

226
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:31,886
No! I mean, not you. Not you.

227
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,964
You are getting younger!

228
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:40,466
You're getting younger by the second. What's your secret?

229
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:45,803
I'm sorry, so where are we?

230
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:48,339
Well, to sum up...

231
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:56,815
...we're having fun. You look young.

232
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:03,122
- Okay...
- But that's not enough.

233
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:08,128
So...

234
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:14,601
...here's a key to my apartment.

235
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:17,706
- Really?
- Really.

236
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,813
You don't think this is too fast?

237
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,074
You gave her a key to your apartment?

238
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:31,780
Not just a key. I gave her the only key!

239
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:37,525
I am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship!

240
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:43,027
- Why did you give her a key? 
- She talked me into a corner, okay?

241
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:46,568
She's like this conversational wizard.

242
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:50,604
So you had the conversation you didn't wanna have...

243
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:53,539
...and you made the gesture you didn't wanna make.

244
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:57,842
Did I start this by saying, "Hey, I did something awesome today"?

245
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:02,044
- Do either of you have a key to my place? 
- I don't think you've ever given us keys.

246
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:03,881
Yeah, why would I? It's my home.

247
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:11,463
- Ross, how did the conversation go? 
- Great. I live on the street.

248
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,658
Where?

249
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:17,561
- Hi.
- Okay, Monica, Rachel...

250
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:20,397
...this is my friend Roger.
- Hi, Roger.

251
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:24,401
I'll get us some drinks. Could you help me?

252
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:26,906
Yeah, okay.

253
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,611
He's here to have sex with you.

254
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,455
- What?
- You're welcome.

255
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,993
- Phoebe, no!
- It's okay. He's a virgin.

256
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:54,163
Rachel, I was talking to this guy. 
I think he'll have sex with you.

257
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,801
Let's leave these two alone.

258
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:02,378
No! I don't care what my hormones are doing! 
I won't do it with some random guy!

259
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:06,545
Fine! Then you tell Roger, because he was really looking forward to this!

260
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,970
Bing! Look at those twin sisters dancing together.

261
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,968
Let me buy you a lap dance with those girls.

262
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:35,306
That's all right, sir. And that's just one girl.

263
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,380
- Bing, what's this?
- It's a hand.

264
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:41,778
It's a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder.

265
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:46,888
It's a wedding ring. Get rid of it. 
We'll throw it in the East River!

266
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:48,490
- No!
- Yes!

267
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:53,460
I did it, and I felt a lot better! You might even hit a seagull in the head.

268
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:59,133
Okay. I'm gonna need a bunch of extra keys.

269
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:02,305
Apparently, I give them away for no reason at all.

270
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:08,074
Ross, what's going on? You're changing the lock?

271
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,542
No.

272
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:11,613
That guy is.

273
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:15,852
You give me a key to your apartment, and then you change the lock?

274
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:19,186
Good luck, buddy.

275
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:27,631
I thought we were moving forward. 
Now you're sending me all these mixed signals.

276
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,662
What are you trying to tell me?

277
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,298
I'm trying to tell you...

278
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:37,735
...I made you a mix tape.

279
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:41,612
- What?
- I love you.

280
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:49,819
And I love spending time with you.

281
00:19:55,994 --> 00:20:00,055
- Hi, honey, I'm home. 
- From the tequila factory?

282
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:02,328
It was awful.

283
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,697
To get out of going to dinner with Doug, 
I told him you and I split up.

284
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:08,736
So then he took me to these strip clubs and sleazy bars.

285
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:13,535
When I wouldn't give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird.

286
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:17,774
Come here. I can breathe through my mouth.

287
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:20,845
- Oh, sweetie.
- You know what the worst part was?

288
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,317
I got to see what my life would be like without you.

289
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:27,784
It was like It's a Wonderful Life with lap dances.

290
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,492
Please promise me that you'll never leave me...

291
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:37,292
...that we'll grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives.

292
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:39,168
I promise.

293
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:44,698
Speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?

294
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:47,468
I don't know if we're there yet.

295
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:54,216
I'd like to order a pizza. Can I ask you a question?

296
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:59,718
Is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? 
Very "Abercrombie & Fitch."

297
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,426
- I'll call you back.
- Who was that?

298
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:06,687
- It's just the pizza place. 
- You hung up on the pizza place?

299
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:09,798
I don't hang up on your friends.

300
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:13,335
- Sorry, honey, I'm just having a rough day. 
- What's wrong?

301
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:17,575
- You don't want to hear about it. 
- Then why did I ask?

302
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:22,507
Okay, this is really embarrassing, but lately, with this whole pregnancy thing...

303
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:26,047
...l'm just finding myself...

304
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,444
How do I put this?

305
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,319
Erotically charged.

306
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:36,016
Is that college talk for "horny"?

307
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:41,722
Yeah. I have all of these feelings, and I don't know what to do about them.

308
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,926
I can't date like a normal person, which is fine because I don't need a relationship.

309
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:49,833
All I really want is one great night! Just sex.

310
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,576
No strings attached. No relationship.

311
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:57,144
With someone I feel comfortable with, and who knows what he's doing.

312
00:21:57,449 --> 00:22:02,751
For just one great night. I mean, is that really so hard...

313
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:06,251
...to find?

314
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,829
So how was your day?

315
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:17,127
Good. I saw a pretty big pigeon.

316
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,675
Well, I gotta get up early, and it's almost 7:00.

317
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,174
- I gotta go to my room.
- Good night!

318
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:29,312
Good night!

319
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,350
- I can't do it! 
- I didn't ask you to do it!

320
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:35,950
- You're Rachel!
- You're Joey!

321
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:37,781
- You're my friend!
- Right back at you.

322
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:42,085
Yeah. Plus, it would be wrong, and weird and bad!

323
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:46,094
So bad! But I don't know what you're talking about. 
I didn't ask you to do anything!

324
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:47,856
I know!

325
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:57,906
- You wanna do it?
- No!

326
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:01,739
- I'm just testing you! 
- Well, that's the end of this conversation!

327
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:04,177
- This conversation never happened! 
- Never happened!

328
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,544
- Good night!
- Good night!

329
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,949
Get back in there!

330
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,095
Listen, I'm sorry about that whole thing with Roger.

331
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:27,999
It really wasn't right. And I want to make it up to you.

332
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:33,143
So I brought you something I think you'll really enjoy.

333
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:45,651
Now this is just a loan, okay?
I'm gonna want him back.

334
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:48,591
I'm gonna go now.

335
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,528
I'm sorry. I thought I could do it, and I can't.
