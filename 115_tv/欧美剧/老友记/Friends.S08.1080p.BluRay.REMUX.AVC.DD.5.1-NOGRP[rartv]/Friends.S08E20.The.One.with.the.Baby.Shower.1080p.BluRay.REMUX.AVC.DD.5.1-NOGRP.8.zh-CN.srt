00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,901
-嗨 -嘿
-Hi! -Hey!

2
00:00:06,068 --> 00:00:09,504
有多少人会来参加 宝宝的欢迎会?
So, what's the finaI head count on my baby shower?

3
00:00:09,672 --> 00:00:12,540
大约有20个人 有些同事有事没办法来
About twenty. CoupIe peopIe from work had something eIse to do.

4
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:14,676
你的妹妹们打电话来说她们没办法来
Your sisters caIIed and can't make it.

5
00:00:14,877 --> 00:00:17,545
什么? 你说她们不来参加…
What? You mean they're not coming to a sociaI event...

6
00:00:17,713 --> 00:00:21,984
没有男人跟酒的社交聚会? 那真的是太稀奇了
...where there's no men and no booze? That's shocking.

7
00:00:22,217 --> 00:00:24,118
我不在乎,只要我妈能来就行了
I don't care, as Iong as my mom's here.

8
00:00:24,553 --> 00:00:28,290
-天啊,你妈 -什么?我妈不会来吗?
-Oh, my God. Your mother. -What? My mom's not gonna be here?

9
00:00:28,491 --> 00:00:33,128
说不定我们忘了邀请她 反而能让她松口气
WeII, given that we forgot to invite her, it wouId be a big coincidence if she was.

10
00:00:33,562 --> 00:00:35,564
我的天啊
My God!

11
00:00:35,798 --> 00:00:38,533
不是我的错 菲比负责发请帖的
Phoebe was in charge of the invitations.

12
00:00:38,734 --> 00:00:41,469
我没有妈妈 所以我常忘了…
I don't have a mother. So often I forget--

13
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,039
得了吧
Oh, give it a rest.

14
00:00:44,307 --> 00:00:47,142
我妈妈不来参加 宝宝的欢迎会?
So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?

15
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:48,677
对
No.

16
00:00:49,412 --> 00:00:52,247
我妈也不会来
Neither is mine.

17
00:00:52,448 --> 00:00:56,919
我们会处理的,我们会打电话给她 你先回家做准备
We'II take care of it. We'II caII her. You go home and get ready.

18
00:00:57,086 --> 00:01:00,623
确定她一定会来 这很重要,她是我妈
Make sure she comes. It's important. It's my mom.

19
00:01:00,824 --> 00:01:03,927
-我知道,她电话号码几号? -我不知道
-I know. What's her number? -I don't know.

20
00:01:04,127 --> 00:01:07,130
你去吧,我记在我的电话簿里了
Go. I have it in my book. Go.

21
00:01:12,769 --> 00:01:16,705
如果你负责寄请帖 为什么是我打电话给她?
If you're in charge of invitations, why am I caIIing her?

22
00:01:16,873 --> 00:01:19,943
喂,葛林太太 嗨,我是摩妮卡盖勒
HeIIo, Mrs. Green! Hi, it's Monica GeIIer.

23
00:01:20,143 --> 00:01:21,777
-哈,摩妮卡 -嗨
-Oh, heIIo, Monica. -Hi.

24
00:01:21,978 --> 00:01:25,848
这是紧急通知 我们打算在今天…
It's Iast-minute, but we've decided to throw an impromptu...

25
00:01:26,082 --> 00:01:29,985
-帮瑞秋的宝宝办欢迎会 -我的女貌们已经告诉我了…
-...baby shower for RacheI today. -My daughters toId me...

26
00:01:30,153 --> 00:01:34,823
她们在一个月前 就接到欢迎会的请帖
...when they received their impromptu invitations a month ago.

27
00:01:34,991 --> 00:01:38,594
-好吧,我很抱歉 -为什么呢?亲爱的
-Okay, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. -For what, dear?

28
00:01:38,795 --> 00:01:41,831
为了没有邀请我 还是你说谎骗我呢?
For not inviting me, or for Iying about it?

29
00:01:41,999 --> 00:01:46,103
天啊,我的屁股在流汗
Oh, my God! My ass is sweating.

30
00:01:46,303 --> 00:01:48,438
我为所有的事道歉 真的,我是说…
I'm sorry for everything. ReaIIy, I mean...

31
00:01:48,638 --> 00:01:50,974
计画宝宝的欢迎会 真的累人
...there's a Iot of pIanning in a baby shower.

32
00:01:51,141 --> 00:01:53,843
我们会忘了一些事 还有…
You know, things get overIooked and....

33
00:01:54,812 --> 00:01:56,246
菲比的妈妈自杀了
Phoebe's mother kiIIed herseIf.

34
00:01:57,915 --> 00:01:59,683
为什么? 你们也忘了邀请她?
Why? Did you forget to invite her too?

35
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:03,888
你真是幽默
Oh, you're so funny.

36
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:09,359
拜,你能来吗? 欢迎会四点开始
PIease, pIease, can you come? It starts at 4:00.

37
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,997
-好吧,四点见 -谢谢
-WeII, aII right. I'II see you at 4. -Thank you.

38
00:02:14,999 --> 00:02:19,970
-不是三点开始吗? -混蛋
-Isn't it at 3? -Son of a bitch!

39
00:02:20,204 --> 00:02:22,206
片名:六人行 宝宝欢迎会

40
00:02:57,442 --> 00:02:59,243
乔伊,你要去打篮球吗?
Hey, Joe! Wanna shoot some hoops?

41
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:02,212
我得告诉你 这次我不要防守那个高个子
And for the record, I am not covering the taII one this time.

42
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,015
好吧,但她没有那么高
Fine, but she's not that taII.

43
00:03:05,817 --> 00:03:09,855
我不能去,我在练习 我要参加新游戏节目主持人的试镜
I can't go. I'm practicing. I got an audition to be the host of a new game show.

44
00:03:10,021 --> 00:03:11,089
-酷啊 -太棒了
-CooI! -Great!

45
00:03:11,322 --> 00:03:14,492
如果我能当上主持人 白天我是德瑞克拉莫瑞医生
If I get it, by day I'II be Dr. Drake Ramoray.

46
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:18,697
但晚上我是乔伊崔比亚尼
But by night I'II be Joey Tribbiani!

47
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,799
你非常适合这份工作 节目名称跟你的名字一样
You'II be perfect for this! That's aIready your name!

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,201
我知道
I know. I know.

49
00:03:23,402 --> 00:03:27,005
我能够得到这份工作是最好的 因为谁都不知道演肥皂剧结果会怎么样
It'd be great if I got this because you never know what couId happen on a soap.

50
00:03:27,205 --> 00:03:29,106
但我可以一辈子 当游戏节目主持人
But I couId be a game-show host forever.

51
00:03:29,274 --> 00:03:31,909
就像巴伯贝克 他主持猜价游戏75年
Like that Bob Barker guy. He's been doing The Price is Right for 75 years.

52
00:03:32,077 --> 00:03:33,043
制片:温蒂诺勒

53
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,414
我敢说前25年的收视率 一定不太好
I bet the ratings weren't good for the first 25.

54
00:03:36,582 --> 00:03:37,583
编剧:雪瑞比尔星葛拉罕 艾伦普勒马
You know, before there was teIevision.

55
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:39,817
那时根本没有电视机

56
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:41,587
导演:凯文布莱特
But the probIem, this game is reaIIy compIicated.

57
00:03:41,753 --> 00:03:43,521
问题是 这项游戏真的很复杂

58
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:46,457
少来了 你也那么说饥饿河马
Come on. You said the same thing about Hungry Hungry Hippos.

59
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,459
上星期你赢了班
And Iast week, you beat Ben.

60
00:03:48,627 --> 00:03:51,763
对 我得跟你们承认
Yeah. I have to be honest with you guys.

61
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,698
他有点放水让我赢
He kind of Iet me win.

62
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,669
再过几小时就要试镜 我搞不懂这个游戏
The audition's in a coupIe hours, and I don't understand the game.

63
00:03:58,004 --> 00:03:59,305
你需要帮忙吗?
Do you want some heIp?

64
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:04,142
真的吗?那真的太棒了 你们可以当参赛者
Oh, reaIIy? That'd be great. Hey, you guys can be the contestants!

65
00:04:04,343 --> 00:04:07,746
我们可以下次 再去打败国中女生
We can Iose to junior-high girIs some other time.

66
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:11,149

I'm a headhunter. I hook up out-of-work Soviet scientists...

75
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:42,849

It's Bogota, but cIose enough.

79
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:58,565
可以把机会让给罗斯 或挑魔法机会牌
You can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango Card.

80
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:02,835
-魔法机会牌可以做什么? -我早该知道的
-What does a Wicked Wango Card do? -I shouId know that.

什么东西向上或是向下?
Higher or Iower than what?

I toId the stripper to be here at 5. That's good, right?

87
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:38,571
你请脱衣舞男来宝宝欢迎会? 那太不适当了
You ordered a stripper for the shower? That is inappropriate.

88
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:41,608
为什么?他会打扮成宝宝的样子

Phoebe, Sandra's mad at you too. It doesn't bother you?

98
00:06:11,906 --> 00:06:15,609
我们道了两次歉 我真的没办法了
We've apoIogized twice. I can't do any more than that.

99
00:06:15,777 --> 00:06:18,512
你讨厌 别人生你的气…
You hate it when peopIe are mad at you...

100
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,816
但你得去 接受它

101
00:06:21,983 --> 00:06:25,319
好吧,我办得到
Okay. I can do that.

102
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:28,756
-我得去帮我的屁股扑痱子粉 -喔
-I gotta go powder my ass. -Oh.

103
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:32,060
看看你的脸 你跟念高中时还是一样
Look at that face! Just Iike when you were in high schooI.

104
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:36,664
要不是我很了解你 我会以为你是个有麻烦的啦啦队员
If I didn't know better, I'd say you were a cheerIeader in troubIe.

105
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:38,532
-来吧,我们去喝点茶 -好吧
-Come, Iet's get some tea. -Okay.

106
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,870
天啊,你看 只剩三星期了
Oh, my! Look at that. OnIy three weeks to go.

107
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:46,807
你挑好奶妈了吗? 如果请管家兼职,她会分心的
Did you pick a nanny? If you use your housekeeper, it wiII spIit her focus.

108
00:06:46,975 --> 00:06:51,579
事实上我不请奶妈 我也没有管家
ActuaIIy, I'm not gonna use a nanny. And I don't have a housekeeper.

109
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,783
你好像山顶洞人
It's Iike you're a cave person.

110
00:06:55,217 --> 00:06:59,621
你得请个奶妈 你不知道带孩子有多累
You must get a nanny. You don't know how overwheIming it wiII be.

111
00:06:59,788 --> 00:07:03,091
你小时候我雇用了K太太
When you were a baby, I had Mrs. K.

112
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:07,362
K太太,对,她人真的很好 她教我西班牙文
Mrs. K! Oh, yeah, she was sweet. She taught me Spanish.

113
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:10,264
我想 我还记得一点
I actuaIIy think I remember some of it.

114
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:14,235
(西班牙文)
Tu madre est谩 loca.

115
00:07:15,204 --> 00:07:17,439
她真是个好人
Such a sweet woman.

116
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:20,208
更重要的是 她成为我们家的一部份
And more important, she became a part of our famiIy.

117
00:07:20,409 --> 00:07:23,512
没错,K太太 她到底姓什么?
That's right, Mrs. K. What did that K stand for?

118
00:07:23,713 --> 00:07:25,948
我不知道,亲爱的 她只是个奶妈
I have no idea, dear. She was the nanny.

119
00:07:26,682 --> 00:07:29,618
她真的很棒 我出不起那笔钱
As great as she was, I can't afford that.

120
00:07:30,385 --> 00:07:33,788
抱歉 有时我忘了不是大家都有赡养费
I'm sorry. Sometimes I forget not everyone has aIimony.

121
00:07:35,991 --> 00:07:37,826
-瑞秋 -什么?
-Oh, RacheI! -What?

122
00:07:37,993 --> 00:07:41,964
我想到一个好点子 我要搬过去跟你们住
I just had a great idea! I'm gonna come Iive with you!

123
00:07:42,632 --> 00:07:44,634
什么?
What? What?

124
00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:49,504
我很高兴 我能帮我女貌这个忙
Oh, I'm so happy I'm gonna do this for my IittIe girI.

125
00:07:49,705 --> 00:07:53,142
看看你 你感动的都快哭了
Look at you. You have tears in your eyes.

126
00:07:54,744 --> 00:07:57,512
没错,我是快哭了
Yes, yes, I do.

127
00:07:59,182 --> 00:08:00,616
罗斯,现在是你领先
Ross, you're in the Iead.

128
00:08:00,816 --> 00:08:04,119
你要再回答一题 或旋转处罚轮?
WouId you Iike to take another question or spin the WheeI of Mayhem?

129
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,057
今天我转轮子的运气不太好 乔伊
The WheeI has not been my friend tonight, Joey.

130
00:08:08,224 --> 00:08:10,059
我要再回答一题
I'II take another question.

131
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,428
好吧,这题很难 仔细听好了
Okay. This is gonna be tough. HoId your breath.

132
00:08:12,628 --> 00:08:14,396
没关系,我准备好了
It's okay. I'm ready.

133
00:08:14,564 --> 00:08:17,533
你得注意听 再回答问题
You gotta hoId your breath untiI you answer.

134
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:20,736
这太可笑了,他没办法注意…
This is ridicuIous! He's not gonna hoId his--

135
00:08:22,105 --> 00:08:28,378
好吧,如果你害怕恐惧的感觉 那该怎么说?惧…
Okay. What do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia? Triska....

136
00:08:28,544 --> 00:08:32,615
天啊,那个字真长,惧…
HoIy cow. That's a big word. Trisk....

137
00:08:32,783 --> 00:08:35,251
看看这个,它该怎么?
Look at this. How do you say that?

138
00:08:35,418 --> 00:08:38,521
-让我看看 -就是这个字
-Let me see that. -This one right here.

139
00:08:39,556 --> 00:08:42,392
-惧13症 -害怕树上
-Triskaidekaphobia. -Fear of Triscuits!

140
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,963
-不,是害怕13 -害怕树上?
-No! No. Fear of the number 1 3. -Fear of Triscuits?

141
00:08:47,197 --> 00:08:50,600
这有可能 它们真的都尖尖的
It's possibIe. They have reaIIy sharp edges.

142
00:08:51,968 --> 00:08:53,436
钱德,轮到你了
ChandIer, you're up.

143
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:57,240
我要用天使通行证 换免费的机会
I'm entitIed to use my AngeI Pass for a free turn.

144
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:01,444
对,但你只能使用一次 请考虑清楚
Yes, yes. But you can onIy use it once, so choose wiseIy.

145
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,914
这真的很难决定
This is tricky.

146
00:09:04,915 --> 00:09:09,585
现在是我领先 但我想再试一次金猴
I mean, I am in the Iead, but I wouId Iove another shot at the GoIden Monkey.

147
00:09:10,787 --> 00:09:15,091
-这个游戏真的很没有道理 -你很生气是因为你输了
-This game makes no sense! -You're upset because you're Iosing.

148
00:09:15,292 --> 00:09:19,229
少来了,罗斯 我想我们都是失败者
Oh, come on, Ross. I think we're aII Iosers here.

149
00:09:19,864 --> 00:09:22,799
我想用 我的天使通行证
I wouId Iike to hang on to my AngeI Pass pIease.

150
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,870
你可以选轮子 或选张搜索牌
You can either spin the WheeI or pick a GoogIe Card.

151
00:09:27,038 --> 00:09:30,641
让我想想 我不在乎
Let me think, Iet me think. Oh, I don't care.

152
00:09:32,644 --> 00:09:34,278
你非选不可
You must choose.

153
00:09:34,478 --> 00:09:38,815
-那还是没有差别 -快选吧,混蛋
-Either. It makes no difference. -Choose, you jackass.

154
00:09:39,817 --> 00:09:43,154
-我要抽卡片 -你选到了给我卡
-I'II take a card. -You picked the Gimme Card!

155
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,757
-你拿到罗斯所有的分数 -什么?
-You get aII of Ross' points! -What?

156
00:09:47,492 --> 00:09:50,161
这个游戏开始好玩起来了
This game is kind of fun!

157
00:09:50,327 --> 00:09:53,464
你不觉得你拿到我的分数 太疯狂了…
You don't think it's crazy that you get my points--?

158
00:09:53,665 --> 00:09:57,635
参赛者 不该交谈的
The contestants aren't supposed to speak to each other.

159
00:09:59,804 --> 00:10:02,439
你要开始 拆礼物了吗?
Now, do you wanna start opening presents...

160
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,376
因为大家 似乎急着想离开
...because it seems Iike peopIe are getting itchy to Ieave.

161
00:10:05,577 --> 00:10:07,178
我说大家 指的是我自己
And when I say peopIe, I mean me.

162
00:10:10,715 --> 00:10:14,118
-你为什么要邀请我妈来? -什么?
-Why did you invite my mother? -What?

163
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:17,622
她要搬过来跟我和罗斯住 以便帮忙照顾宝宝
She wants to move in with me and Ross to heIp take care of the baby.

164
00:10:17,855 --> 00:10:20,191
-多久? -八星期
-For how Iong? -Eight weeks.

165
00:10:20,358 --> 00:10:24,929
我爱我妈,但是天啊 跟她一起吃午餐太久就是种折磨
I Iove my mother, but, my God, a Iong Iunch with her is taxing.

166
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:28,133
如果她想跟我住 我会觉得很光荣
I'd be honored if she wanted to Iive with me.

167
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,868
她听不到
She can't hear you.

168
00:10:32,037 --> 00:10:33,705
我该怎么样?
What am I gonna do?

169
00:10:33,906 --> 00:10:37,742
如果不希望她搬过去 你该直说的
If you don't want her to move in with you, just teII her.

170
00:10:37,943 --> 00:10:40,913
你说的对 我就快生了
You're right. I'm about to have a baby.

171
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:44,282
我可以说我不希望 她睡在沙发上
I can say I don't want her sIeeping on my couch.

172
00:10:44,449 --> 00:10:47,719
她会睡在我床上 绝不能让那种事发生
She'II wanna sIeep in my bed. This can't happen.

173
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,154
没错
That is right.

174
00:10:49,321 --> 00:10:52,123
告诉她 你不希望她搬过去跟你们住
TeII her you don't want her to Iive with you.

175
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,659
别让她拒绝你
Do not take no for an answer.

176
00:10:55,594 --> 00:11:00,265
这真的太棒了 现在她会生瑞秋的气
This is great! Now she's gonna be mad at RacheI!

177
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:05,571
我要跑过去 当她的乖女貌讨好她
And I'm just gonna swoop in there and be Iike the daughter she never had.

178
00:11:05,738 --> 00:11:07,472
甜心 你得忘了这件事
Oh, honey, you have to Iet it go.

179
00:11:08,807 --> 00:11:10,142
好吧
Okay.

180
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,012
谁不会接受道歉呢?
Who doesn't accept an apoIogy?

181
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,714
那真的很简单
I mean, it's just so simpIe.

182
00:11:15,914 --> 00:11:18,150
“对不起,珊卓拉” “没关系,摩妮卡”
''I'm sorry, Sandra.'' ''That's okay, Monica.

183
00:11:18,317 --> 00:11:19,485
我原谅你
I forgive you.

184
00:11:19,652 --> 00:11:21,486
还有,你非常漂亮
And by the way, you're very pretty.''

185
00:11:23,522 --> 00:11:27,926
我真的要很尊敬钱德了
I have new respect for ChandIer.

186
00:11:28,161 --> 00:11:32,465
好了,大伙们 该来拆礼物了
AII right, everybody! It's time to open the presents!

187
00:11:32,631 --> 00:11:35,601
对 瑞秋要拆的第一样礼物…
Yes! The first gift that RacheI opens...

188
00:11:35,802 --> 00:11:38,237
应该是外婆送的礼物
...shouId be from the grandmother.

189
00:11:38,404 --> 00:11:44,377
因为你是这里最重要的人 也是全世界最重要的
Because you're the most important person in this room! And in the worId!

190
00:11:44,844 --> 00:11:47,914
我没有准备礼物 因为我在最后一分钟才被邀请
I don't have a gift because I wasn't invited untiI the Iast minute.

191
00:11:48,114 --> 00:11:53,119
但非常谢谢你,亲爱的 让大家都注意到这一点
But thank you so much, dear, for bringing that to everybody's attention.

192
00:11:55,121 --> 00:11:59,692
你们这些不重要的人呢? 我们来拆你们的礼物吧
How about you Iess important peopIe? Let's open your presents!

193
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,530
-你没准备礼物也没关系 -但我也算是送了你一样礼物
-It's okay that you didn't get a gift. -I kind of did.

194
00:12:04,698 --> 00:12:07,100
我要跟你同住八个星期
Me! Eight weeks of me.

195
00:12:07,267 --> 00:12:11,104
好吧,妈妈 事实上我可以自己照顾宝宝
Okay. See, Mom, the truth is, I can do this on my own.

196
00:12:11,271 --> 00:12:14,040
我知道你会是个好妈妈
I know you're gonna be a terrific mom.

197
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:17,177
但一开始你需要帮忙
But you need heIp at the beginning.

198
00:12:17,377 --> 00:12:20,013
我知道我在做什么 我应付得来
I know what I'm doing. I can handIe it.

199
00:12:20,214 --> 00:12:22,048
真的吗?还记得亮亮吗?
ReaIIy? Remember TwinkIes?

200
00:12:22,249 --> 00:12:26,152
He was a hamster. I'm not gonna vacuum up my baby!

201
00:12:26,353 --> 00:12:29,689
快来吧,瑞秋 拆礼物的时间到了
Okay, come on, Rach. It's present time!

202
00:12:29,856 --> 00:12:32,859
你是 这个派对的主角
You're the gIue hoIding this party together.

203
00:12:33,027 --> 00:12:36,330
现在这个派对也快毁了
It's kind of faIIing apart here.

204
00:12:36,496 --> 00:12:38,698
-你看 -哇
-Oh, Iook! -Wow!

205
00:12:38,866 --> 00:12:40,734
这是你同事送的
This is from your friends at work.

206
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:46,473
天啊,哇 我知道这是什么
Oh, my gosh! Oh, wow! Oh, I know what this is.

207
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,475
等一下
Wait a minute.

208
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:51,646
不可能
That can't be right.

209
00:12:52,246 --> 00:12:55,415
这是宝宝的啤酒机吗?
Is that a beer bong for a baby?

210
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,718
女貌,那是挤奶器
DarIing, that's a breast pump.

211
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:05,659
我说过我不再猜了吗? 好吧,谢谢
Did I say I was done guessing? Okay, thank you for that.

212
00:13:05,893 --> 00:13:08,428
哇,这是什么?
Oh, wow! What's this?

213
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:12,066
-它是尿布精灵 -它是用来放干净尿布的
-It's a Diaper Genie. -It dispenses cIean diapers!

214
00:13:12,267 --> 00:13:14,335
那是放脏尿布的
It's where you put dirty ones.

215
00:13:14,702 --> 00:13:18,538
我为什么不直接 把尿布丢在外面的垃圾桶?
Why don't you take it outside and throw it in a dumpster?

216
00:13:18,706 --> 00:13:23,744
-你每天要丢十次吗? -什么?宝宝一天可以拉十次?
-You're gonna do that 1 0 times a day? -What, it goes 1 0 times a day?

217
00:13:23,944 --> 00:13:26,446
我们得喂她印度食物吗?
Are we feeding this baby Indian food?

218
00:13:27,082 --> 00:13:29,817
不,宝宝都是那样的
No, dear. That's what babies do.

219
00:13:30,085 --> 00:13:34,389
瑞秋,听你妈妈的话 她非常聪明
RacheI, Iisten to your mother. She is very smart.

220
00:13:35,456 --> 00:13:40,294
你去倒垃圾桶时 宝宝要放在哪里?
What wiII you do with the baby whiIe you trot out to the garbage?

221
00:13:40,896 --> 00:13:44,465
我不知道 把她放在尿布上?
I don't know, I'd Ieave it on the changing tabIe?

222
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:49,705
-什么?我做了什么? -你不能丢下宝宝一个人
-What? What did I do? What did I do? -You can't Ieave a baby aIone.

223
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,606
我当然知道
Of course, I know that!

224
00:13:51,773 --> 00:13:54,642
千万不能 丢下宝宝一个人
Of course you never Ieave a baby aIone.

225
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:57,245
它会… 她会不安全
It wouId-- She wouIdn't be safe.

226
00:13:57,713 --> 00:14:01,649
她跟我这个菜鸟妈妈在一起 也不会安全
Not as safe as she wouId be with me, the baby dummy.

227
00:14:01,817 --> 00:14:05,620
现在拆礼物 太刺激了
Opening the presents is a IittIe overwheIming right now.

228
00:14:05,787 --> 00:14:09,224

231
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:20,969
好吧,妈妈,别离开我
Okay, Mommy, don't ever Ieave me.

232
00:14:22,804 --> 00:14:27,008

In what fiIm wouId you hear this Iine: ''We don't need no stinking badges!''

235
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,917
什么?那样子可以加分?
What? There's extra points for that?

236
00:14:36,085 --> 00:14:37,786
平公不
Fair not that's!

237
00:14:38,454 --> 00:14:41,256
我要爬上机会梯 到金泥屋去

你不是认真的
You're not serious!

281
00:17:23,488 --> 00:17:27,692
她是个好人 但我们无法忍受她八个星期
She's a very nice woman, but we can't take eight weeks of her.

Didn't your agents give you the revised ruIes?

293
00:18:12,237 --> 00:18:15,307
我们把那些东西都删掉了 没有轮子或机会卡
We've eIiminated aII that. No wheeI. No cards.

294
00:18:15,475 --> 00:18:17,477
为什么?
Why?

295
00:18:17,643 --> 00:18:21,814
那太复杂了 颧众没办法了解
It was too compIicated. PeopIe didn't foIIow it.

296
00:18:21,981 --> 00:18:25,985
复杂? 转轮子上机会梯…
CompIicated?! Spin the WheeI to go up the Ladder of Chance...

00:18:35,895 --> 00:18:38,964
现在这只是个 简单的问答游戏
It's a simpIe question-and-answer game now.

301
00:18:39,165 --> 00:18:41,367
那有什么好玩的呢?
WeII, what's fun about that?

302
00:18:41,534 --> 00:18:46,038
你要我主持 颧众回答问题的无聊游戏?
You expect me to host a boring game of peopIe answering questions?

303
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:49,008

So I thought we'd put the changing station in the Iiving room.

306
00:18:55,715 --> 00:18:59,118

I thought I'd bring in my decorator because I feeI Iike I'm at my best...

307
00:18:59,285 --> 00:19:01,220
把房子弄得珠光宝气

308
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:04,724
当然,谁不是呢?
Sure, who doesn't?

309
00:19:06,092 --> 00:19:09,562
你买的那些 恐龙小玩意…
Oh, and aII those dinosaur knickknacks you have...

310
00:19:09,763 --> 00:19:11,965
它们或许比较适合 放在车库里
...they might be more at home in the garage.

311
00:19:12,265 --> 00:19:17,637
-我们没有车库 -我说车库吗?我是说垃圾桶
-WeII, we don't have a garage. -Did I say garage? I meant garbage.

312
00:19:18,805 --> 00:19:23,810
你知道吗? 或许你不一定要跟我们住在一起
You know what? Maybe it's not absoIuteIy vitaI that you Iive with us.

00:19:23,977 --> 00:19:29,515
-瑞秋需要人帮忙带孩子 -真的,我什么都不会
-WeII, RacheI needs heIp with the baby. -I reaIIy do. I don't know anything.

314
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,584
我相信那不是真的
I'm sure that's not true.

315
00:19:31,818 --> 00:19:34,654
是吗? 我会带孩子吗?
Oh, no? Do I know anything about babies?

316
00:19:34,821 --> 00:19:37,858
-不 -那真的很可怕
-No. Not a thing. -It's frightening.

317
00:19:38,091 --> 00:19:41,161
就算她不会 但是我会
Even if she doesn't know anything, I do.

318
00:19:41,328 --> 00:19:43,464
我会教她
And I'II be there to show her.

319
00:19:44,331 --> 00:19:46,800
瑞秋的爸爸 也是那么告诉我
That's exactIy what RacheI's father toId me.

''I'm tired. You take care of it.''

322
00:19:51,772 --> 00:19:54,407
后来他想跟我求欢时 我也是那么告诉他
Which I Iater said to him when he wanted to have sex.

323
00:19:59,546 --> 00:20:01,782
我不是瑞秋的爸爸
WeII, I'm not RacheI's dad.

324
00:20:01,949 --> 00:20:04,418
我没有恶意 但他是个混蛋
And no offense, but he's an ass.

325
00:20:05,887 --> 00:20:07,821
我真的喜欢你,罗斯
I do Iike you, Ross.

326
00:20:09,323 --> 00:20:12,859
我有个貌子 他妈妈跟我没有住在一起
I have a son. His mother and I didn't Iive together.

327
00:20:13,027 --> 00:20:17,564
他跟我一起住时 我都是自己照顾他
When he was with me, I took care of him aII the time, by myseIf.

328
00:20:17,732 --> 00:20:20,902

跟另一个女人生的
With another woman.

330
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:26,407
你没有自制力吗?罗斯
Have you no controI, Ross?

331
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,912
那是另一个问题
That's a different issue.

332
00:20:31,413 --> 00:20:36,283
重点是宝宝出生后 我会帮忙喂她…
The point is, when the baby comes, I wiII be there to feed her...

333
00:20:36,484 --> 00:20:38,820
帮她洗澡换尿布
...and bathe her and change her.

334
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:42,356
我愿意照顾她

-You'II be a great father. -You'II be a wonderfuI grandma.

338
00:20:56,138 --> 00:21:00,142
哈 我还是不知道我该做什么
HeIIo? I stiII don't know what the heII I'm doing!

339
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:03,645
新手妈妈 都会有那种感觉
Every first-time mother feeIs that way.

340
00:21:03,811 --> 00:21:09,817
你可以慢慢学,你会的 当你刚到纽约来时…
You're gonna pick it up. Hey, you wiII. Look, when you first came to the city...

341
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:15,357
你是个被宠坏的无助小女孩 只会用爸爸的信用卡
...you were a spoiIed, heIpIess IittIe girI who used Daddy's credit cards!

342
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,526
我希望 你真的有话要告诉我

345
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:28,804

I have no doubt you're gonna be an incredibIe mother.

346
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:32,174

348
00:21:37,346 --> 00:21:39,782

349
00:21:40,316 --> 00:21:42,318
不,甜心,别送了
No, sweetheart, stay put.

350
00:21:42,518 --> 00:21:47,623
我自己出去,就当我没来过这里 我差点真的来不了
I'II Iet myseIf out. It's Iike I'm not here. Which I aImost wasn't.

351
00:21:48,691 --> 00:21:53,896
你真的太幽默了 我做了什么?
You're just so funny. You're so funny. What do I do?

352
00:21:54,263 --> 00:21:58,133
没什么 你跟她道歉很多次
Nothing. You have apoIogized to her, Iike, a miIIion times.

353
00:21:58,301 --> 00:22:01,404
她只是 无视你的道歉
And she's been nothing but terribIe to you.

354
00:22:01,637 --> 00:22:06,875
你让她女貌办了 一个可爱无聊的欢迎会
You just threw her daughter a IoveIy, aIbeit sIightIy boring, shower.

355
00:22:07,043 --> 00:22:12,148
-她甚至没有谢谢你 -你知道吗?你说的对
-And she hasn't even thanked you for it. -You know what? You're right.

356
00:22:12,381 --> 00:22:15,518
如果你有话要说 快告诉她
If you wanna say anything, I'd teII her off.

357
00:22:15,684 --> 00:22:17,152
真的吗?
ReaIIy?

358
00:22:18,621 --> 00:22:20,923
好吧,我会的
Okay, I wiII.

359
00:22:21,124 --> 00:22:23,459
葛林太太
Mrs. Green?

360
00:22:23,727 --> 00:22:25,161
葛林太太
Mrs. Green?

361
00:22:25,328 --> 00:22:28,230
不跟主人道别 就离开派对是很无礼的
It is rude to Ieave a party without saying goodbye to the host.

362
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:33,268
如果有人跟你道歉 你得接受
When someone apoIogizes to you, the decent thing to do is to accept it.

363
00:22:33,437 --> 00:22:35,705
我不是故意要那么做的
What I did wasn't on purpose.

364
00:22:35,872 --> 00:22:39,542
但你对我的态度 太可耻了
But what you're doing to me now is pIain spitefuI.

365
00:22:39,743 --> 00:22:41,077
-可耻? -没错

366
00:22:41,311 --> 00:22:45,214
你该好好去照镜子 小姑娘

367
00:22:45,382 --> 00:22:47,116
老太婆
OId Iady!

368
00:22:47,317 --> 00:22:49,118
女士
Lady!

369
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:52,221
别说了
Wrap it up. Wrap it up. Wrap it up.

370
00:22:53,089 --> 00:22:57,060
只要你准备好跟我道歉 我会原谅你
So whenever you're ready to apoIogize to me, I wiII forgive you.

371
00:22:57,261 --> 00:22:59,563
再见
