1
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:05,200
This one's rare. This one's medium-well. Go!

2
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:07,202
Hey, Phoebe! How was dinner?!

3
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:10,808
Dinner was good! Just saying hi! Now I'm gonna go!

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:15,008
- Well, hello there.
- Hi.

5
00:00:15,281 --> 00:00:17,749
I didn't see this on the menu.

6
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:20,818
Tim, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, this is Tim, my new sous chef.

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,319
- So you're Monica's boss? 
- No, she's my boss.

8
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:27,050
- "Sous" is French for "under." 
- I "sous-stand."

9
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:32,120
Tim, I need a calamari and a caesar salad. 
And could you get me the pesto?

10
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:34,823
- You made pesto?
- Yes, I did.

11
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:38,004
Would you say your pesto is the best-o?

12
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:41,469
I don't know. I would say it's pretty good-o.

13
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:45,842
I still need the calamari and salad.

14
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:47,636
I like your necklace.

15
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:51,374
"Coming up, Monica.
I have to obey you, otherwise the system breaks down."

16
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:54,747
"I know that. " "Then why are we having this conversation?"

17
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:57,286
- I made it myself.
- You are so talented.

18
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,617
Well, it's no pesto.

19
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,861
Let's just cut to the chase. 
You're single. You're single.

20
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,794
He gets off work at 11. 
She'll be waiting for your call.

21
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:11,800
I'll give him your number if I could just get one calamari and one caesar salad!

22
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:17,335
I did not yell. I am not putting a dollar in the jar.

23
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:25,815
The One With Rachels Date

26
00:01:56,449 --> 00:02:00,545
- Wow, Bing! Burning the midnight oil. 
- You know me, sir.

27
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:04,654
Do you know how I can get around the office computer network...

28
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:07,759
...so I can access the really good Internet porn?

29
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:11,020
You're a joker, Bing.

30
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:14,432
What's funny about that?

31
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:19,737
- Sorry I kept you waiting so long. 
- That's okay. Where do you wanna go?

32
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:21,837
I think you know where I wanna go.

33
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,475
- The Hard Rock Cafe?
- Yeah.

34
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:27,175
- Again?
- Yeah.

35
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:32,446
- I'm telling you, I like the food. 
- You like the Purple Rain display.

36
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:37,215
- Hey, Bob.
- Hey, Toby. Have a good night.

37
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:42,884
- Did that guy just call you Toby? 
- Yeah, he thinks that's my name.

38
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:47,792
- Why don't you correct him? 
- It's been going on way too long now.

39
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:51,399
The first time, we were just passing each other, so I didn't say anything.

40
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:54,801
The next time he said, "Toby, want a doughnut?"

41
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,568
I wanted the doughnut.

42
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:02,044
Five years later, the doughnut's gone and I'm still Toby.

43
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:06,183
- Chandler, you have to tell him. 
- That would be so awkward.

44
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:09,546
We don't work together. He's on the sixth floor.

45
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:12,587
So he calls me Toby once in a while.

46
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:15,385
It's not like he's calling me Muriel.

47
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:20,155
Muriel. Why would he call you Muriel?

48
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,801
Oh, my God.

49
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:29,805
Chandler "M." Bing.

50
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:35,604
It's not just an "M." Your middle name is Muriel!

51
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:38,373
It is a family name.

52
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:42,213
Chandler Muriel Bing.

53
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:46,788
Your parents never even gave you a chance, did they?

54
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:50,896
Drake, I've discovered the reason for your memory loss.

55
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,028
What is it?

56
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:55,131
Your brain transplant wasn't successful.

57
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,097
Your body's rejecting Jessica's brain.

58
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,363
Is it serious?

59
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,937
Not if we extract tissue from the original body...

60
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:08,842
...and synthesize antibodies to stop you from rejecting the brain.

61
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:12,515
That sounds simple enough. Let's just do that.

62
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:16,381
We would, but when we went to exhume Jessica's body...

63
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,784
...it was gone.

64
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,195
Very nice, people.

65
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:26,465
I'll change and we can go.

66
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:31,067
- What happened to Jessica's body? 
- You'll have to see it on TV.

67
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:34,204
- You don't know, do you? 
- Couldn't care less.

68
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:38,208
- Good scene, man.
- You too.

69
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:43,407
What? You weren't in it.

70
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:48,351
Kash, this is my friend Rachel. Rachel, Kash.

71
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:52,284
- Hi. 
- Why haven't I seen you here before?

72
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:58,155
Joey just thinks I'll embarrass him. 
He thinks I'm a soap opera nut.

73
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,625
Which I'm not. I'm not.

74
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,935
Although, I do know your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan.

75
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:10,434
And your dog's name is Wally.

76
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:13,803
- Look, I'm just stroking your arm.
- Here we go.

77
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:16,877
Bye, Kash. Say hi to Wally.

78
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,012
- Monica.
- Hi.

79
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:28,020
I had the best time with Tim last night. 
He is so sweet.

80
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,796
I can't wait to get "sous-neath" him.

81
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,666
- I have to fire him.
- Why?

82
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:38,062
He's terrible. He's slow. He burns things.

83
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,898
He lit my pastry chef on fire.

84
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,242
He was nervous. You can be intimidating.

85
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,139
And your pastry chef can stand to be taken down a peg.

86
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:51,839
Well, now she has no eyebrows. 
Mission accomplished.

87
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:55,211
But, Monica, he loves his job so much.

88
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:58,980
Can't you just give him another chance, please?

89
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,395
All right. But if he lights someone else on fire, he's gone.

90
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:07,088
That's fair. Thank you so much.

91
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:10,931
Looks like he got you a little bit too.

92
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:14,062
I paid to have this done.

93
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:18,242
Love it!

94
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,048
Hey. You know, Kash really liked you.

95
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:27,252
He thought you were charming.

96
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:31,318
- I thought I was an idiot.
- I'm with you.

97
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:37,590
- He asked if you'd go out with him. 
- I think I'm gonna throw up a little.

98
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,855
- What did you say?
- "No."

99
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,861
What?

100
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:47,061
I figured since you're pregnant, 
you're not gonna be seeing people.

101
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:52,474
First of all, Kash Ford? Not people.

102
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:55,112
Did you tell him I was pregnant?

103
00:06:55,381 --> 00:07:00,842
No. I didn't know if you told people. 
This was when Kash was still "people."

104
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:04,681
- Good. Just have him call me. 
- I don't think that's...

105
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:09,417
Go do it or I'll come back to that set. 
I'll meet more actors.

106
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:14,658
- Hey, Bob. 
- How's my pal Toby doing today?

107
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,664
If I see him, I'll ask.

108
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:23,998
Was that Bob from six you were just talking to?

109
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,835
- Yeah.
- You know him?

110
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:28,443
We're on a semi-first-name basis.

111
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:33,247
- What about adding him to our team? 
- Bob?

112
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:39,185
Working here with us? Every day? 
I don't know if he has what it takes.

113
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:43,054
- They love him down on six. 
- But this is 11.

114
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:46,264
It's almost twice as hard up here.

115
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:50,265
- Okay, Bob will stay put. 
- I think it's best, sir.

116
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:54,028
We do need to find somebody. 
Work is starting to pile up.

117
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,266
I've got a stack of documents this high.

118
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:01,708
Just toss them in the shredder and claim you never got them.

119
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,714
That's a good one, Bing.

120
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:09,585
What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?

121
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:17,854
I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go.

122
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:21,498
I called the chef who recommended him to me.

123
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:24,862
He said, "Ha, ha! Gotcha!"

124
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,765
- But don't fire him today.
- Why?

125
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,737
- Because I'm dumping him today. 
- You said he was sweet.

126
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:35,607
He's too sweet. He calls me all the time.

127
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:39,179
"Did you get home okay? Was your shower okay?"

128
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,010
- Don't pick up the phone. 
- Then he comes over!

129
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:45,452
"I was so worried about you." Be a man!

130
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,922
So I can't fire him?

131
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,254
And dump him the same day? He'll kill himself.

132
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:53,829
I'll fire him, and you go out with him another week.

133
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,766
Are you kidding? Another week with that simp, I'll kill myself.

134
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,098
We'll both do it today and he'll just have to deal with it.

135
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:07,279
Okay. But who's gonna go first? 
Whoever goes second is the bitch.

136
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:10,480
- What?
- Fire a guy that's just been dumped?

137
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:14,149
Bitch! And dump a guy that's just been fired?

138
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:16,216
Blond bitch!

139
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:20,687
I wanted to do this days ago, so I think I should go first.

140
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:23,188
All right, that makes sense.

141
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,260
But screw you! I'm going first!

142
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,762
- Toby, you got a sec?
- Sure. What's up?

143
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,704
I wanted to get transferred up here, but it's not gonna happen.

144
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:43,142
Apparently somebody thinks I'm not "11 th-floor material."

145
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:47,280
Say, who the hell is this Chandler?

146
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:52,987
What's the best excuse for why I'm not drinking on this date tonight?

147
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,057
"I'm a recovering alcoholic," "I'm a Mormon"...

148
00:09:56,362 --> 00:10:00,492
...or "I got so hammered last night I'm still a little drunk"?

149
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,529
You're not gonna tell him you're pregnant?

150
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:06,136
I don't think so. Books say wait till the third date to tell the guy...

151
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,306
...you got something growing in your uterus.

152
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:11,008
- Hey.
- Hi.

153
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,677
What do you want to do tonight?

154
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,746
There's a powerful Ukrainian film playing. Interested?

155
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:22,181
No. But I'll go see a normal-person movie with you.

156
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:26,357
- Rach, you wanna come? 
- I can't. I've got a date.

157
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:30,051
- A date? 
- Yeah. Why, is that weird for you?

158
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:34,892
Why, no. It's the opposite of weird. It's regular.

159
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:39,103
It's mundane. It's actually a little dull.

160
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:42,102
It's no Ukrainian film.

161
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:44,366
Earrings!

162
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:50,572
- She's got a date? With who? 
- I set her up with this actor.

163
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:55,276
- You set her up?
- No.

164
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:58,581
- What were you thinking? 
- That it was okay...

165
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,589
...because you two haven't dated in five years.

166
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:06,924
I'm worried about my baby. 
Whoever she dates, my baby dates.

167
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:13,172
- Where is this "actor" taking them? 
- Hey! I'm an "actor" too.

168
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,904
They're taking the ferry to a place on Staten Island.

169
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:23,946
My baby's going on a ferry? 
Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?

170
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:28,119
Arert we talking about those big boats that go really slow?

171
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:33,986
Why not just jump out of an airplane or burn each other with matches?

172
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,391
- Hey, Joey. 
- Hey, Kash. Ross, this is Kash.

173
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:44,830
Hey, I hear you're going on a ferry tonight.

174
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,299
Bit of a daredevil, are we?

175
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:52,210
Do you guys think this is too slutty? Hi, Kash.

176
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:57,005
- Hey, Rachel. You ready to go? 
- Yeah. See you guys later.

177
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:01,777
Have a great time, you guys. And yes, it is too slutty!

178
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,716
Hi.

179
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:10,554
Hi.

180
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:14,722
I'm glad you called. 
I feel like I'm always calling you.

181
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,832
What's up? Is everything okay with Phoebe?

182
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:22,368
It will be in a minute.

183
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:27,068
- Tim, you're a really great guy. 
- That's because I'm with you.

184
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:34,417
It's just, I'm in a place in my life right now where...

185
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:38,481
So sorry. "This just in."

186
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,160
It's the restaurant. Monica needs me right away.

187
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:45,852
No, she doesn't! I know what that is. You can stay.

188
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:48,899
I'll miss you too, Pheebs.

189
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:53,732
And I will be holding you right here.

190
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:05,078
What movie do you wanna see?
And not one I have to read.

191
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,285
I get that from books.

192
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:11,619
- Books?
- Okay, car magazines, cereal boxes...

193
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:13,154
...but it's enough!

194
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:18,358
Let's not see a movie. We'll just stay here and hang.

195
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:24,729
- Just wait for Rachel to come back? 
- Hey, if that's what you wanna do.

196
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,336
Dude, what is going on?

197
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,734
- I have to find out how it went.
- Why?

198
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:36,037
- He could be my baby's stepfather. 
- One date and they're getting married?

199
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,509
He's not you!

200
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,351
I can't believe she's dating!

201
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:46,718
- What did you think she was gonna do? 
- I don't know.

202
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:51,463
- I can't believe this is happening. 
- What do you mean?

203
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:55,929
I thought when I had another kid, it'd be different.

204
00:13:56,569 --> 00:14:01,973
I love Ben. But every time I drop him off at Carol and Susars...

205
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,936
...it breaks my heart a little.

206
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:09,741
I've always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed...

207
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:15,511
...my kid comes running in, leaps up on the bed and we all read the paper.

208
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:18,881
Maybe fight over the science section.

209
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:25,531
- That's nice. You can still have that. 
- No. Rachel's out with some guy.

210
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:28,597
My baby went with her.

211
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:33,528
If anything, that picture keeps moving further away.

212
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,505
Hey, can I ask you something?

213
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:42,781
In this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel?

214
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,917
It used to be.

215
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:50,286
Now she doesn't really have a face.

216
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:53,652
Smokir body, though.

217
00:14:55,227 --> 00:15:00,096
Good call. But the face, Ross, the face isn't Rachel.

218
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:04,166
No. But how much easier would it be if it were?

219
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:06,437
That's not what she wants.

220
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:10,539
I know. And I can't force myself to fall in love with her.

221
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:13,939
Ross, maybe you need a new picture.

222
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:17,842
It won't be what you thought. 
But no matter what...

223
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:22,554
...there's gonna be a brand-new little baby. Your baby.

224
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:26,086
Who cares what the picture looks like?

225
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,088
Yeah.

226
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:32,158
Let's you and me go out and have some fun.

227
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:34,898
Whatever you want. Come on.

228
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:39,964
- We can catch that Ukrainian film. 
- No, I said fun.

229
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,569
- Hey, Toby?
- Hey, Bobby.

230
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,571
It's Bob, actually.

231
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,716
You work up here. Where's Chandler Bing's office?

232
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:55,509
Yeah, it's right...

233
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:59,356
Right there. Let me ask you, why?

234
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:01,923
I wanna talk to that bastard, see what his problem is.

235
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,061
Okay, Bob. Listen.

236
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:08,258
I'm the reason you didn't get the job.

237
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:10,432
- Toby, don't.
- Bob.

238
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:15,003
Toby, I'm not gonna let you cover for him.

239
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:19,404
Anything you say will just get me more upset with Chandler.

240
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:22,841
That puts me in a difficult position.

241
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:26,717
You do anything to Chandler, it's gonna bring you down to his level.

242
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:31,486
I guess you're right.

243
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:35,820
Don't give him the satisfaction. 
You're better than Chandler. We all are.

244
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:38,393
Especially me, Toby.

245
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:45,331
- Is everything okay?
- That depends.

246
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:49,437
- How are you and Phoebe? 
- Great. Thanks for introducing us.

247
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:54,510
My pleasure. Okay, I'm afraid I've got some bad news.

248
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,647
- Phoebe!
- Monica!

249
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,745
- You're fired! 
- I'm breaking up with you!

250
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,881
I'm breaking up with you.

251
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:06,148
- You're fired.
- Why?

252
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:10,351
I'm sorry. I'm not ready for a relationship right now.

253
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:14,826
I'm sorry too. But I like things done a certain way.

254
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:20,197
- The chemistry's just not right. 
- The chemistry thing for us too.

255
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,303
Wow. Okay.

256
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:32,481
I realize I came on a little strong. 
It's because I think you're amazing.

257
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:38,682
I wanna tell you how much I appreciate you giving me an opportunity.

258
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:42,256
You're the most talented chef I've ever worked for.

259
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,726
Anyway...

260
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,933
- Tim, wait.
- Yeah?

261
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:58,735
I spoke too quickly. There's a learning curve with this job.

262
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:01,468
Maybe we could try it again.

263
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:05,079
Thank you so much. I know I can be better.

264
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:10,878
And, Tim, I just want to say good luck here.

265
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,889
- Hello.
- Hi.

266
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:22,429
How was the date?

267
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:27,936
I'm alone and I just bought $ 15 won'th of candy bars. What do you think?

268
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:32,371
- What happened? 
- I told him I was pregnant.

269
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:37,172
- He didn't take it so well?
- Well, better than you.

270
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:40,452
- But still not what you want.
- Oh?

271
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:44,122
Yeah. He got all weird and sputtery. Then he said:

272
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:47,187
"I hear those hemorrhoids are a bitch."

273
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:50,286
- He sounds swell.
- Doesn't he?

274
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:55,530
You want a little cheering up? Sit down.

275
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:59,936
Guess whose middle name is Muriel.

276
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:07,935
Chandler M. Bing. Oh, my God.

277
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,518
- I'm sorry about your date. 
- It's all right.

278
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:18,051
I guess I'm just done with the dating thing.

279
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:22,521
Just one more thing in my life that's completely different.

280
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:26,525
- This is hard.
- Yeah, I know.

281
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:34,268
On the other hand, in seven months you're gonna have something...

282
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:40,172
...that you're gonna love more than any guy you've ever gone out with.

283
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:43,138
Just wait.

284
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:48,581
Wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger.

285
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:51,117
You have no idea.

286
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,890
Thanks, sweetie.

287
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:04,193
- You wanna grab some coffee? 
- No. I'm gonna go eat 10 candy bars.

288
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:08,963
- I thought I cheered you up. 
- You did. There are 20 in here.

289
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,173
- Good night.
- Good night.

290
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:22,780
Ross? Hey, it's Mona. From the wedding.

291
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,523
- Oh, hi!
- Hi.

292
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:30,588
- How are you? 
- I'm good, except you owe me a dance.

293
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:36,425
That's right. Well, would you be interested in seeing a Ukrainian film?

294
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:40,363
Oh, you're serious. Sure.

295
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,372
Great. Well...

296
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:49,877
- I think I need another cup of coffee. 
- Sure, let me get it for you.

297
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,154
Bob?

298
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:07,730
Bob!

299
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:09,691
Bob!

300
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:14,838
- What the hell are you doing? 
- This is Chandler's office.

301
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,007
Come on, Toby. 
Give me a hand!
