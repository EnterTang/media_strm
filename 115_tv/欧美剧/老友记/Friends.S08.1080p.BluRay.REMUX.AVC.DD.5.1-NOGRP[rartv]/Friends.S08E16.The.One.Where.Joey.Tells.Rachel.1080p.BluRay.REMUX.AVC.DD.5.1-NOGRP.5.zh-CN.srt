1
00:00:03,703 --> 00:00:07,104
There's this woman that I like a lot.

2
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:09,399
But it's complicated.

3
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:12,805
She was with this other guy for a long time.

4
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:16,241
I could never do that to the guy. We're friends.

5
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:20,385
So this guy she used to go out with, is he a good guy?

6
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:23,148
The best.

7
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:25,789
- Then talk to him.
- I don't know.

8
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:29,186
It's won'th finding out, if you like her.

9
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:30,986
I do, so much.

10
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:33,891
I can't stop thinking about her. I can't sleep...

11
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:37,464
You know what? You have to go for it.

12
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:42,231
How often does this happen to you? 
You owe it to yourself.

13
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,273
It's Rachel.

14
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:57,755
I'm sorry, did you just say it's Rachel?

15
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:00,749
Yes.

16
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,427
You like Rachel?

17
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:10,396
Yes. I like Rachel.

18
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:18,744
Rachel?!

19
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:22,146
Yeah. Okay, but look, you know...

20
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,576
You know who else I like? You.

21
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:28,410
And it doesn't get said enough.
 I like you, Ross.

22
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:32,953
- "Rachel" Rachel?
- It's not a big deal.

23
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:36,458
It's not a big deal? I'm sorry, I just...

24
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:39,822
What about the stuff you said?

25
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:44,593
How you can't stop thinking about her? 
How you can't sleep?

26
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:46,499
I'm an actor, you know?

27
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,469
As a group, we tend to be overdramatic.

28
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,770
Rachel-who's-carrying-my-baby Rachel?

29
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:57,175
I know it's bad. And I know it's wrong, okay?

30
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,385
It's not like anything's ever gonna happen.

31
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:03,451
These are just feelings. They'll go away.

32
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,155
You know, I gotta go.

33
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,619
Hey, Ross...

34
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:11,592
You know, I just have one... Rachel?!

35
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:24,400
Rachel?!

36
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:36,820
The One Where Joey Tells Rachel

39
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:04,142
Okay, she's kicking.

40
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:07,450
She's growing inside you.

41
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:13,254
- That was a big one. 
- That's the youngest girl to reject me.

42
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,591
- You guys!
- Hey there.

43
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,989
Let me ask you. Do you believe in soul mates?

44
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:20,459
Oh, yes, I do.

45
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:23,295
There's one person out there for everyone.

46
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:26,366
You know how you find him? Stop looking.

47
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:29,506
I've stopped looking for Russell Crowe.

48
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:31,470
He'll find me.

49
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:32,804
And you?

50
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:37,948
No. I believe that certain people are more suited for each other, but...

51
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,685
- Soul mates? I don't think they exist. 
- Good.

52
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:43,582
- Why?
- Well, last night, I met Monica's.

53
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:49,420
What?

54
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:53,359
I had a date with this guy. 
I swear he's her other half.

55
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,537
You don't think there's somebody better suited for Monica than me?

56
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,508
Well, what's he like?

57
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:06,969
- He's tall. He has brown hair. 
- Of course.

58
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:11,411
A tall guy with hair similar to mine? 
Oh, unknowable universe!

59
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:14,518
- He works with food. 
- Oh, sure. Older?

60
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:18,154
- Obviously. And he's British. 
- I was just gonna ask!

61
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:22,657
And he's so centered, and mature and confident.

62
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,227
It's so sad they never met.

63
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:29,800
Luckily, the guy she settled for can't hear you.

64
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,704
Oh, I'm so sorry. Maybe I'm wrong.

65
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,736
We're going out again. I'll find out more.

66
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:38,773
He's meant for her, and you're gonna date him?

67
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:42,072
He may not be my soul mate, but a girl's gotta eat.

68
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:49,955
Rachel?!

69
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,626
I didn't know Joey was on JAG.

70
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:05,696
- Hey.
- Hey.

71
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:09,032
I talked to Joey. I wanted to see you.

72
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:13,177
I still can't believe it. Joey and Rachel?

73
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:16,382
It's like you and me going out, only weirder.

74
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:19,283
I know you're hurting...

75
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,483
...but don't say that again.

76
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:27,115
What if they marry? 
He'd be the stepfather of my child.

77
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,361
You don't need to worry.

78
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,926
He'll never tell her how he feels.

79
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:34,961
If he did, you don't know how she'd react.

80
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:39,069
Sure, women never like Joey. I think he's a virgin.

81
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,806
- He isn't thinking about going for her. 
- He's not?

82
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,568
All he's thinking about is how you're taking this.

83
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,577
It's freaking him out. He wants to move to Vermont.

84
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:55,918
- Why? 
- He wants to leave the country.

85
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,088
He thinks you hate him.

86
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,763
Hate him?

87
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:08,759
No, I don't hate him.

88
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,968
It's just, it's Rachel. You know?

89
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,142
I can't even imagine how hard this must be for you...

90
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:22,177
...but I don't want you to lose Joey over it.

91
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:26,612
Right now, he needs to know that you're still his friend.

92
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,752
Okay, I'll talk to him.

93
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:32,547
I'd do it soon.

94
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:37,455
He just asked me how to convert his dollars into Vermont money.

95
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,536
- Hi!
- Hi.

96
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:48,969
- Chandler, Monica, this is Don. 
- Hello.

97
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,108
Hello, nice to meet you. How are you?

98
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,834
Soul mate.

99
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:59,079
- What are you guys doing? 
- We had lunch at Adriatica.

100
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:03,754
- What's with the sun-dried tomatoes? 
- I know! Is this 1985?

101
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,482
- That's what I said! Isn't it strange? 
- Not really.

102
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:11,229
What's wrong with sun-dried tomatoes?

103
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,761
On a barbecued-chicken pizza?

104
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:17,366
No?

105
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:22,207
- What restaurants do you like? 
- Octavio. 27-and-7.

106
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:26,571
- There's this place, Alessandro's. 
- Oh, my God! I'm the chef!

107
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:29,508
You're kidding! Your food is fantastic!

108
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:33,650
I want to talk about your menu. 
Anyone want coffee?

109
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:36,980
If you're talking about me, I'll go with you.

110
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,216
I'll have a mocha-ccino.

111
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,125
What are you doing?

112
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:53,233
I swear, I didn't know you guys would be here.

113
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:55,837
You don't believe in soul mates, so...

114
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:59,806
I believe in handsome strangers who hit on my wife.

115
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:04,983
Just because I think they're soul mates doesn't mean anything'll happen.

116
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:07,445
Phoebe? Good work.

117
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:10,155
He's great. I love him.

118
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:15,561
Don't worry, we'll find you someone else.

119
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,803
I understand if you came by to hit me. I deserve it.

120
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,206
No, I don't want to hit you.

121
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:36,779
What, then? Kick me?

122
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,242
No.

123
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:40,879
Bite me?

124
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,953
I don't want to do anything to you.

125
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,282
I just want to say I'm not mad at you...

126
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:51,856
...and that I certainly do not hate you.

127
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,523
I just came here to say that.

128
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,996
Hey, wait, Ross?

129
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:02,967
You wanna come in for a beer or something?

130
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:07,008
Yeah, sure.

131
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,118
You got any beer?

132
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:18,915
All I got is melon stuff that Rachel left.

133
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:20,655
Okay.

134
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:31,036
You need to understand something.

135
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:39,004
I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay?

136
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:43,807
I wouldn't do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you.

137
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,484
Thank you.

138
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:06,531
Anyway, it'll just...

139
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:09,970
It'll take me a while to get over her.

140
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:14,178
I'm not sure how to do that. I've never been in love, so...

141
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,846
What?

142
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,717
You're in love with her?

143
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:25,447
- Yeah. I thought you knew that.
- No.

144
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:31,491
Look, if it helps, I don't want to feel this way, honest.

145
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:35,996
I just keep thinking, "I'll get over this," you know?

146
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:39,966
But it just keeps getting harder.

147
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:43,471
I don't know what to do, you know?

148
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,968
What do I do?

149
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:58,456
- You need to tell her how you feel. 
- That's the green stuff talking.

150
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:03,726
I'm serious. You need to find out where she is.

151
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,727
If she's not where you are, you can start to move on.

152
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:11,002
But what if, and I'm not saying she will be...

153
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:14,400
If she is where you are...

154
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:20,903
...then my feeling weird shouldn't stand in the way.

155
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,814
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

156
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:27,742
If she ends up with somebody else...

157
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,683
...the truth is, she couldn't find a better guy.

158
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,153
Hey, thanks.

159
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:40,456
- So when are you gonna talk to her? 
- Oh, my God. I have to tell her.

160
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:44,899
I haven't thought about it. What should I say?

161
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:48,800
I'm understanding, but let's not get carried away.

162
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,173
What am I gonna say?

163
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,248
Yeah, tell me about it.

164
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:17,792
I'm phasing out the wine importing and focusing more on the cheese.

165
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,833
Cheese, you say?

166
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:23,267
That's some pretty smelly work, huh, Don?

167
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:27,312
- Excuse me?
- Cheese. It's smelly.

168
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,479
You must smell a lot of the time too.

169
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:37,656
Not really. But with cheese, I think the smellier, the better.

170
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:42,351
Me too! Chandler hates it. 
I can't have blue cheese in the house.

171
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,530
And you're still married to him?

172
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:55,029
I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and cheese.

173
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,400
Not even bread. Just cheese.

174
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,474
No, I want the bread.

175
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,977
And pastries.

176
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,215
And pate.

177
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:08,075
I'm really not high. I just used to be fat.

178
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:12,221
I have a villa in the Loire Valley you can stay in.

179
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,449
Is it made of cheese?

180
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:20,763
No. A house made of cheese, wouldn't that be incredible?

181
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:23,763
- I'd move in tomorrow! 
- Oh, come on!

182
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:27,598
- Listen to this!
- I'm so sorry.

183
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:31,903
- What do we do? 
- They both want a house of cheese.

184
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:35,341
I don't know how you fight that.

185
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:45,619
Okay, okay. I can do this. 
I can tell her how I feel.

186
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:48,086
Okay, stand up straight.

187
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:51,123
Take a couple deep breaths.

188
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:54,494
Look confident.

189
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,135
Joey? What's up?

190
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:04,536
I came by because I want to talk to you about something.

191
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:05,971
What's up?

192
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:09,045
Here, in the hall? What are we, animals?

193
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:12,513
I'm late for a meeting. Could you make it quick?

194
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:16,188
I just came by to tell you that...

195
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:20,252
...I want to have dinner with you.

196
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,120
Sure. Just tell me where to meet you.

197
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:28,265
Okay. That's good.

198
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:31,695
That gives you a couple of hours to prepare.

199
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,038
Don't you people ever knock?

200
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,204
I'd like to have Don and Phoebe over. 
Wouldn't that be nice?

201
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:40,809
Sure. Set it up.

202
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,140
I'll just be browsing through the personals.

203
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,448
Are you okay? You're acting weird.

204
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,188
Yeah. Fine. Not perfect.

205
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,253
But good enough.

206
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:54,215
Jeez, what's with you?

207
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:57,360
I'm sorry, did you say "cheese"?

208
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:02,858
- What's going on? 
- Phoebe says you and Don are soul mates.

209
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:06,128
I don't believe in that, but you two get along.

210
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:11,433
I'll step aside if you wanna go with Don and live in a house of cheese.

211
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:16,546
- You don't believe in soul mates? 
- No, but I'm sure "tomahtoes" does.

212
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:20,750
I don't believe in soul mates, either.

213
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,181
- You don't?
- Nope.

214
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:24,888
We weren't destined to end up together.

215
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:28,591
We fell in love and work hard at our relationship.

216
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:31,419
Some days we work really hard.

217
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:36,092
So you don't want to live with Don in a cheese house?

218
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:42,001
No, I've had second thoughts. 
Do you know how hard it'd be to clean?

219
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,606
- I love you.
- I know.

220
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:47,243
I'm gonna take you out to dinner.

221
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:51,644
I found this place that makes the greatest jalape? 
O poppers.

222
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,250
No? They taste so good.

223
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:04,694
It happens whenever Chandler touches my stomach.

224
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,660
I'm worried the baby won't like him.

225
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:13,697
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, sure.

226
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,970
Look, the reason...

227
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:22,877
Is it hot in here?

228
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:26,174
Why don't you take off your sweater?

229
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:29,019
This is a nice place...

230
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:33,883
...and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin doing Hobbes.

231
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:37,721
Oh, my God, really? Can I see it?

232
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:39,123
Yeah, sure.

233
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,358
I wouldn't think Hobbes would like that so much.

234
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:53,877
How long have we known each other?

235
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:55,910
Seven, eight...

236
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:58,582
Eight years. Wow.

237
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:00,244
A long time.

238
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:04,451
But over the past few weeks, I...

239
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:09,023
Okay! Sorry about the wait, but it is mega-jammed in here.

240
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:10,853
Our specials tonight...

241
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,598
- Could you give us a second? 
- Sure.

242
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:15,094
Second's up!

243
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:21,669
Not that kind of table.

244
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,309
So you were saying?

245
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:29,409
I'm not sure.

246
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:33,984
You asked how long we knew each other, and I said eight years.

247
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:38,483
Then the waiter came over and cut his tip in half...

248
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,056
...and now here we are.

249
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:45,327
Yeah. Here we are.

250
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,473
I think I'm falling in love with you.

251
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,044
What?

252
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,844
I'm falling in love with you.

253
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,760
Who are you talking to?

254
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:19,923
Oh, you're kidding. It's a joke.

255
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,796
Funny. It's funny!

256
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,036
I don't get it.

257
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,546
Okay.

258
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,608
Wow.

259
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:44,247
Okay, so the specials are...

260
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:54,892
Are you...?

261
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:00,333
How did...?

262
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,566
When?

263
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,209
Does it really matter?

264
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,543
Wow. Wow.

265
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,876
It is hot in here.

266
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,711
I know this is a lot.

267
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:19,081
You don't have to say anything.

268
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:23,353
You take as much time as you need.

269
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,297
Okay, you gotta say something.

270
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:37,541
Joey, I love you so much.

271
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:39,744
- But...
- But.

272
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:41,935
Joey?

273
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,647
Right. Hey, that's...

274
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,110
That's okay. That's fine.

275
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:52,050
It's pretty much what I was expecting.

276
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,825
It's no big deal, all right?

277
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:02,560
- I think I'm gonna go. 
- Please don't leave like this.

278
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:06,362
You can't do this to a pregnant woman!

279
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:08,763
Don't start doing that.

280
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,408
You can't do that, because you're gonna make me...

281
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,509
Oh, there we go!

282
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,883
- Can I?
- Sure.

283
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:24,187
Oh, Joey. I don't want to lose...

284
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,391
Hey, hey.

285
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:31,685
You can't, okay? Ever.

286
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:35,289
I'm so sorry.

287
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:38,469
Please don't be sorry.

288
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,797
Okay? Don't be sorry.

289
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:51,582
You know, I was only kidding.

290
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:54,979
Yeah, that was a real good one.

291
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,096
- Is this your table?
- Yeah.

292
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,699
- You'll be here all night. 
- I know.

293
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:13,437
I haven't even read the specials.

294
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,338
What's the matter?

295
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:20,136
I don't know. I think maybe one of them is dying.

296
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:25,243
I kind of hope it's the girl.

297
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:29,143
The guy is really cute!
