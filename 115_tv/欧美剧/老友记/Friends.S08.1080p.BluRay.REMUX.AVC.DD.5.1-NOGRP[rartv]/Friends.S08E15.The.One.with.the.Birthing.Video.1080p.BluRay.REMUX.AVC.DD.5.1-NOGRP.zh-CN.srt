131
00:09:07,986 --> 00:09:10,788
甜心， 别碰我
-See, honey, there's-- -Don't touch me!

132
00:09:13,226 --> 00:09:15,894
-嗨 -嘿

133
00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:19,131
-亚特兰大好玩吗? -很好玩
-How was AtIantic City? -Good.

134
00:09:19,398 --> 00:09:21,900
我帮你买了礼物
I brought you back a present.

135
00:09:22,135 --> 00:09:23,936
你不必…
You didn't have to--

136
00:09:24,203 --> 00:09:26,405
咸水太妃糖?
SaItwater taffy?!

137
00:09:27,306 --> 00:09:29,174
谢谢
Thanks.

138
00:09:29,408 --> 00:09:32,277
有趣的是 它没有加任何海水
InterestingIy, it isn't made with seawater.

139
00:09:32,445 --> 00:09:35,714
事实上 它是用加盐淡水做的
It's actuaIIy made with saIted fresh water.

140
00:09:37,383 --> 00:09:39,752
那一点都不有趣
That's not interesting.

141
00:09:39,953 --> 00:09:43,389
-我觉得很有趣 -我也是,我想你
-I think it's interesting. -Me too. I missed you!

142
00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:44,556
我也是
Me too.

143
00:09:44,758 --> 00:09:46,625
-这星期你过得如何? -非常好
-How was your week? -Good.

144
00:09:47,426 --> 00:09:50,228
-宝宝开始会踢人了 -太棒了
-The baby started kicking. -How exciting!

145
00:09:50,396 --> 00:09:55,267
太神奇了 只不过第一次我并不在场
It was amazing. The onIy thing is, I wasn't there the first time.

146
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:59,539
-不 -我错过了所有的过程
-Oh, no. -I was missing out on aII this stuff.

147
00:09:59,739 --> 00:10:04,811
-乔伊建议瑞秋搬过来跟我住 -想得美
-Joey suggested RacheI move in with me. -Yeah, right.

148
00:10:05,912 --> 00:10:08,681
-什么? -乔伊害我笑得肚子痛
-What? -Joey cracks me up.

149
00:10:08,948 --> 00:10:12,952
“让你的前妻搬进去 那一点也不别扭”
''Have your ex-wife move in. That wouIdn't be awkward.''

150
00:10:17,924 --> 00:10:20,293
想像我离开了几天…
Imagine, I go away for a few days...

151
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:24,363
我男朋友跟怀了他孩子的女人 住在一起
...and my boyfriend is Iiving with a woman he got pregnant.

152
00:10:27,934 --> 00:10:29,602
你怎么跟他说?
So, what'd you teII him?

153
00:10:41,048 --> 00:10:43,717
你没有告诉蒙娜 瑞秋搬过去了?
You didn't teII Mona RacheI moved in?

154
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:47,554
她似乎觉得 那是个疯狂的点子
She seemed to think it was such a crazy idea.

155
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:51,892
而且她送我太妃糖
PIus, she got me taffy.

156
00:10:52,092 --> 00:10:54,928
-真的吗?我没吃过太妃糖 -真的?
-ReaIIy? I've never had any. -Ever?

157
00:10:55,129 --> 00:11:00,033
我妈忙着计画自杀 没空买海滩小吃给我
My mom was too busy pIanning her suicide to provide saItwater treats.

158
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,269
谢谢
Thank you.

159
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,004
你要告诉她吗?
Are you gonna teII her?

160
00:11:05,205 --> 00:11:07,907
我想我得先哄哄她
I wiII. I want to butter her up first.

161
00:11:08,175 --> 00:11:12,612
我要带她去吃晚餐 做一些浪漫的事
I'm gonna take her to dinner, do aII this romantic stuff.

162
00:11:12,913 --> 00:11:16,050
当她觉得 我是有史以来最棒的男朋友时…
When she thinks I'm the best boyfriend ever...

163
00:11:16,317 --> 00:11:20,288
我会告诉她我怀孕的前女友 跟我一起住
...I'II teII her my pregnant ex-girIfriend is Iiving with me.

164
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:25,459
或许我没有说过 她是个非常幸运的女人
If I haven't said it before, she's a Iucky, Iucky Iady.

165
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:30,531
我们… 这个玩意怎么了?
So where are--? What the crap is up with this stuff?

166
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:36,403
它是口香糖吗?它是食物吗? 怎么了?
Is it gum? Is it food? What's the deaI?

167
00:11:38,706 --> 00:11:41,108
好好吃 我能试试粉红色的吗?
Oh, it's nice. May I try a pink one?

168
00:11:43,811 --> 00:11:47,381
我得计画 这个完美的夜晚
So I just have to pIan the perfect night.

169
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:49,584
你最棒的约会经验 是什么?
Hey, what's the best date you ever had?

170
00:11:50,118 --> 00:11:53,354
去年葛瑞格海曼 带我去吃很好吃的寿司大餐
Last year, Greg Hayman took me to a very nice sushi dinner.

171
00:11:53,521 --> 00:11:56,456
我们散步 到附近的研究室…
Then we took a romantic waIk to a nearby research Iab...

172
00:11:56,624 --> 00:11:59,226
我们闯进里面 放走二十只猴子
...where we trashed the pIace and freed 20 monkeys.

173
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:05,065
我就知道 我就知道我没有发疯
I knew it! I knew I wasn't crazy!

174
00:12:05,634 --> 00:12:09,104
去年的确有一只猴子 在公车站攻击我
Last year, a monkey did attack me at the bus stop!

175
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:17,078

So between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross...

176
00:12:17,346 --> 00:12:19,381
这种事绝不能发生
...it just isn't gonna happen.

177
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:23,885
那就像是 你爱上一只猫
It'd be Iike you faIIing in Iove with a cat.

178
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,388
-嘿 -嘿

179
00:12:27,656 --> 00:12:32,327
我最喜欢的狗怎么了?
How's my favorite dog, huh? How's my favorite dog?

180
00:12:33,195 --> 00:12:34,930
你太压抑了
You're subdued.

181
00:12:35,131 --> 00:12:38,934
-你让喝啤酒了? -不
-Did you give him a beer? -No.

182
00:12:39,401 --> 00:12:43,104
-对不起,我们需要谈一谈 -当然
-WiII you excuse us? We need to taIk. -Sure.

183
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:46,241

185
00:12:52,982 --> 00:12:55,417
-我们聊了一些事 -什么事?
-We taIked about stuff. -What stuff?

186
00:12:56,285 --> 00:12:58,019
关于瑞秋的事
RacheI stuff.

187
00:12:58,654 --> 00:13:04,059
乔伊,你害得很难过
Oh, Joey, you bummed him out! This is the happiest dog in the worId.

188
00:13:04,293 --> 00:13:06,728
He spends a day with you, and Iook!

189
00:13:08,665 --> 00:13:10,466
He's breathing.

190
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:14,936
好吧,在看着我们 表现的快乐一点,好吗?
Okay, weII, he's watching us so just Iook happy, okay?

-I'II take him to Wendy's. -He's fine.

192
00:13:23,513 --> 00:13:24,647
你看
Look.

193
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:26,248
快接球
Here's your baII!

194
00:13:26,516 --> 00:13:29,752
去接球 去接球
Get your baII! Get your baII!

195
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:32,288

当然
Of course.

197
00:13:34,891 --> 00:13:36,792
你不要网球
You don't want a tennis baII.

198
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,962
因为你可以吃肉球
Not when you can have a meatbaII.

199
00:13:41,831 --> 00:13:43,900
来吧,去接肉球
Come on, get the meatbaII.

200
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:50,039
天啊,我对你做了什么?

201
00:13:50,273 --> 00:13:53,876

I'm going to pick up Mona. What are you doing tonight?

204
00:14:10,227 --> 00:14:12,662
我有很棒的情人节计画
Oh, I got big VaIentine's pIans.

205
00:14:12,896 --> 00:14:17,167

I got my Chinese food on the way, and your saItwater taffy.

206
00:14:17,635 --> 00:14:21,639
真有趣 它没有加海水…
InterestingIy, it isn't made with seawater--

207
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,108
我们是一起 看那部纪录片的
We actuaIIy watched the documentary together.

208
00:14:26,544 --> 00:14:29,479
我的外卖来了 我去拿钱

我应该去接你的

212
00:14:43,194 --> 00:14:47,030
我帮你做了情人节晚餐 大惊喜

213
00:14:50,534 --> 00:14:54,905
-蒙娜 -嗨,瑞秋
-Oh! Hey, Mona! -Hi, RacheI.

214
00:14:55,106 --> 00:14:57,208
她在这里做什么?
What's she doing here?

215
00:14:57,575 --> 00:14:59,743
我不知道
I have no idea.

216
00:15:00,711 --> 00:15:04,047
如果你们要找我 我在房里看电视

217
00:15:04,715 --> 00:15:06,149

218
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,720
最近 她喜欢待在这里

219
00:15:09,988 --> 00:15:13,291
-为什么? -我想她很寂寞
-Why? -I think she's IoneIy.

220
00:15:14,092 --> 00:15:17,428
但今天是情人节 我们能请她离开吗?
But it's VaIentine's Day. Can't we ask her to go?

221
00:15:17,696 --> 00:15:20,965
不行,她太激动了
WeII, no, she's way too emotionaI.

222
00:15:21,232 --> 00:15:24,602
我是说她疯了
And by emotionaI, I mean crazy!

223
00:15:27,471 --> 00:15:30,140
我的外卖来了
That's just my Chinese food.

224
00:15:30,341 --> 00:15:32,309
她叫外卖送到这里来?
She has food deIivered here?

225
00:15:32,544 --> 00:15:37,315
对,她很激动,但她大胆
Yes, she's emotionaI, but baIIsy.

226
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:43,387
我要去换运动服 躺在床上吃饭
I'm gonna get in my sweats and eat this in bed.

227
00:15:46,325 --> 00:15:50,261
你还以为 她会妨碍到我们
And you thought she was gonna be in our way!

228
00:15:50,829 --> 00:15:55,166
打开香槟 我马上回来
Open the champagne, and I wiII be right back.

229
00:15:55,434 --> 00:15:59,738
-我有大惊喜 -你另一个前妻也藏在里面?
-I've got a surprise. -You got another ex-wife back there?

230

00:16:12,617 --> 00:16:15,353
我希望 你不会误会
I hope you don't take this the wrong way.

233
00:16:15,654 --> 00:16:18,990
-你在做什么? -你要打电话吗?
-What are you doing? -Do you need the phone?

234
00:16:19,491 --> 00:16:20,992
不
No.

235
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:25,196
罗斯太好心了没办法说出口 但这是他的公寓
Ross is too nice to say it, but this is his apartment.

236
00:16:25,397 --> 00:16:29,768
我们需要隐私 你为什么不回你家呢?
We need boundaries, so why don't you go back to your pIace.

237
00:16:29,969 --> 00:16:32,972
蒙娜,我住在这里
But, Mona, I Iive here.

238
00:16:35,174 --> 00:16:38,843
情人节快乐
Happy VaIentine's Day!

239
00:16:43,115 --> 00:16:47,686
或者这能让你在分手后记得我
Or, something to remember me by.

240
00:16:55,695 --> 00:16:59,298
-这次是多久? -九十秒
-How Iong has it been this time? -Ninety seconds.

241
00:16:59,532 --> 00:17:03,368
九十秒没想到它 真的很久
Ninety seconds is a Iong time not to think about it.

242
00:17:03,603 --> 00:17:06,305
但我满脑子都是它
Except aII I did was think about it.

243
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:08,173
我知道,我也忘不了
I know. It haunts me.

244
00:17:08,408 --> 00:17:14,179
在这之前我看过最糟糕的事 是我爸跟服务生上床
TiII now, the worst thing I'd seen was my dad doing shots off the houseboy.

245
00:17:14,414 --> 00:17:18,551
在这之后我会很乐意 把他们的照片做成银幕保护程式
After this, I wouId gIadIy make that my screen saver.

246
00:17:18,818 --> 00:17:23,856
我们得忘了这件事 我们得假装它不存在
We have to get past this. We'II pretend it never existed.

247
00:17:24,357 --> 00:17:25,525
我可以那么做
I couId do that.

248
00:17:30,931 --> 00:17:34,534
我们只需要 丢掉那张椅子
Now aII we gotta do is get rid of this chair.

249
00:17:48,882 --> 00:17:51,384
-谢天谢地 -我知道
-Oh, thank God! -I know.

250
00:17:52,085 --> 00:17:53,519
请进
Come in!

251
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,790
我很抱歉 破坏了你们的情人节
Hi. I'm sorry to barge in on your VaIentine.

252
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:00,793
我得远离那些叫骂声 蒙娜要跟罗斯分手
I had to get away from the yeIIing. Mona's dumping Ross.

253
00:18:00,994 --> 00:18:03,363
-天啊 -可怜的罗斯
-Oh, my God. -Poor Ross.

254
00:18:06,967 --> 00:18:11,972
我们看过他穿内裤做瑜珈 但这次他更惨
We watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he cIoses the drapes.

255
00:18:13,407 --> 00:18:16,577
关于那卷 你想看的生产录影带
You know that birthing tape you wanted to see?

256
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:17,844
它在这里
It's here.

257
00:18:18,045 --> 00:18:22,149
我们得在你看它之前警告你 千万别看它
We shouId warn you before you watch it. Don't watch it.

258
00:18:23,084 --> 00:18:24,885
你们看过了?很可怕吗?
You saw it? Is it scary?

259
00:18:25,086 --> 00:18:28,622
讽刺的是 生孩子的画面…
It's ironic how footage of someone being born...

260
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:31,859
让人想要自杀
...can make you want to kiII yourseIf.

261
00:18:33,327 --> 00:18:36,863
甜心,她不必看它 但她非生孩子不可
Honey, she may not have to watch it but she's going to have to do it.

262
00:18:37,031 --> 00:18:41,035
现在我吓坏了 你们能跟我一起看吗?
Now I'm aII freaked out. WiII you watch it with me?

263
00:18:41,268 --> 00:18:45,872
不,但我会把有我体味的毛衣 放在你旁边
No, but I'II Ieave a sweater that smeIIs Iike me right next to you.

264
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,374
摩妮卡,少来了 你想生孩子
Monica, come on. You want to have kids.

265
00:18:48,542 --> 00:18:50,410
没错
I do.

266
00:18:50,578 --> 00:18:52,947
但送子鸟 会把宝宝送来给我
But the stork is gonna bring mine.

267
00:18:54,281 --> 00:18:57,851
说真的 你们不能逼我一个人看这个
SeriousIy, you're not gonna make me watch this aIone.

268
00:19:01,122 --> 00:19:03,690
她说的对,当然不行
She's right. Of course not.

269
00:19:03,925 --> 00:19:06,060
甜心,去拿录影带
Honey, get the tape.

270
00:19:13,134 --> 00:19:17,138
这让我想起了 录影带里某一段内容
This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape.

271
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:21,508
当然,如果你把鸡腿放在那里 你是个烂室友
Oh, sure. But if you Ieave a drumstick under there and you're a bad roommate.

272
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:25,280
来吧
Here we go.

273
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,181
好吧
Okay.

274
00:19:29,317 --> 00:19:30,985
天啊
Oh, my.

275
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,656
加油
Come on, come on.

276
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:38,226
为什么宝宝要折磨那个女人?
Why is that baby torturing that woman?

277
00:19:38,426 --> 00:19:41,896
为什么我要看这个玩意三次?
Why have I seen this thing three times?

278
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,167
好美
It's beautifuI.

279
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:51,005
-好可怕 -我知道,我为你感到难过
-It's horribIe! -I know, I know! I'm so sorry for you!

280
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,776
我该怎么办?我不要做这个 我要怎么把宝宝丢掉?
What do I do? I don't want to do this! How do I get out of it?

281
00:19:56,078 --> 00:20:00,215
-大家快看 -什么?她的屁股爆炸了吗?
-You guys! You guys, Iook! -What? Did her ass expIode?

282
00:20:02,718 --> 00:20:05,854
不,宝宝出来了,你们看
No, the baby's out. Look.

283
00:20:07,556 --> 00:20:11,694
看看那些小手指跟小脚趾
Look at those IittIe fingers and toes.

284
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,029
看看妈妈现在有多高兴
Look how happy the mom is now.

285
00:20:15,263 --> 00:20:19,667
-瑞秋 -去你们的,你们不必生小孩
-Oh, Rach. -Screw you! You don't have to do it!

286
00:20:23,772 --> 00:20:25,573
-嘿 -嘿
-Hey. -Hey!

287
00:20:25,841 --> 00:20:29,377
-怎么了? -蒙娜刚刚甩了我
-What's up? -Mona just dumped me.

288
00:20:29,578 --> 00:20:32,347
天啊,我很遗憾,为什么?
Oh, man, I'm sorry. Why?

289
00:20:32,548 --> 00:20:37,052
最近我不是 完美男友
LateIy, I haven't exactIy been the perfect boyfriend.

290
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,888
我没有告诉她 我让瑞秋怀孕
I didn't teII her I got RacheI pregnant.

291
00:20:40,189 --> 00:20:45,228
我给她我家的钥匙 然后换了锁
I gave her a key to my apartment and then had the Iocks changed.

292
00:20:45,528 --> 00:20:48,997
我骗她 瑞秋搬到我家的事
Then I Iied to her about RacheI moving in with me.

293
00:20:49,265 --> 00:20:54,203
在某方面 我怪她不早点跟我分手
In a way, I judge her for not breaking up with me sooner.

294
00:20:54,403 --> 00:20:58,206
那真的很烂 特别是在情人节
That reaIIy sucks. EspeciaIIy on VaIentine's Day.

295
00:20:58,407 --> 00:21:02,110
等一下 你在这里做什么?
Wait a minute. What are you doing here?

296
00:21:02,311 --> 00:21:05,180
乔伊在情人节 没有约会?
Joey without a date on VaIentine's Day?

297
00:21:05,414 --> 00:21:08,717
发生了什么事?你跟女人有麻烦?
What's going on, huh? GirI troubIe?

298
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:12,521
-可以那么说 -真的吗?
-Sort of. -ReaIIy?

299
00:21:12,756 --> 00:21:15,624
你不必表现得这么高兴
You don't have to seem so happy about it.

300
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:18,427
或许我能帮忙
Maybe I can heIp.

301
00:21:20,263 --> 00:21:23,632
不论发生了什么事 我相信我也有相同的经验
Whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me.

302
00:21:24,768 --> 00:21:28,738
事实上 我有次在做爱时被甩了
You know, actuaIIy, once I got dumped during sex.

303
00:21:33,777 --> 00:21:37,781
-到底发生了什么事? -算了,没什么大不了的
-So anyway, what is it? -Forget about it. It's no big deaI.

304
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:40,516
-少来了,怎么了? -没事
-Come on, what is it? -It's nothing.

305
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,519
是我 你为什么不告诉我?
Hey, it's me. Why can't you teII me?

306
00:21:46,023 --> 00:21:49,626
好吧,坐下
Okay. Sit down.

307
00:21:53,497 --> 00:21:57,300
我很喜欢一个女人
There's this woman that I Iike a Iot.

308
00:21:57,467 --> 00:21:59,669
但那是不可能的
But it can't happen.

309
00:22:00,838 --> 00:22:02,439
她不会是你的姐妹吧?
She's not a Tribbiani?

310
00:22:05,142 --> 00:22:06,276
不
No!

311
00:22:07,712 --> 00:22:10,647
她是你的同事?
So is she someone from work?

312
00:22:12,182 --> 00:22:13,250
对
Yes.

313
00:22:13,951 --> 00:22:15,819
她喜欢你吗?
WeII, does she Iike you?

314
00:22:17,822 --> 00:22:20,124
有时候我觉得是的
Sometimes I think she couId.

315
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,959
但我什么事都不能做
But I can't do anything about it.

316
00:22:23,193 --> 00:22:24,294
为什么?
Why not?

317
00:22:24,595 --> 00:22:26,330
事情很复杂
It's compIicated.

318
00:22:27,865 --> 00:22:30,367
她跟另一个男人 交往了很久
She was with this other guy for a Iong time.

319
00:22:30,668 --> 00:22:32,837
他也是我的同事
Someone from work too.

320
00:22:34,372 --> 00:22:37,908
我没办法那样对他 我们是好朋友
I couId never do that to the guy. We're friends.

321
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:40,745
等一下 我以为你讨厌所有的同事
Wait, I thought you hated everyone at work.

322
00:22:40,945 --> 00:22:43,948
不,我会那么说…
No, no. I onIy say that...

323
00:22:44,415 --> 00:22:49,019
钱德才不会觉得被威胁了 因为我是他唯一的朋友
...so ChandIer won't feeI threatened because I'm his onIy friend.

324
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,324
你说什么?
Excuse me?

325
00:22:53,524 --> 00:22:55,993
抱歉 我也是你唯一的朋友
Sorry, sorry. And I'm your onIy friend too.

326
00:22:59,965 --> 00:23:05,170
以前跟她交往过的那个男人 还爱着她吗?
So this guy she used to go out with, is he stiII in Iove with her?

327
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:08,272
-我想应该不爱了 -好吧
-No, I don't think so. -Okay.

328
00:23:08,506 --> 00:23:10,274
他是好人吗?
Is he a good guy?

329
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,844
对,他是最棒的
Yeah, he's the best.

330
00:23:14,045 --> 00:23:16,781
-跟他谈一谈 -我不知道
-Then taIk to him. -I don't know.

331
00:23:16,982 --> 00:23:20,151
如果你喜欢她 这值得试一试
It's worth finding out, if you Iike her.

332
00:23:20,351 --> 00:23:21,986
我真的非常喜欢她
I do, so much.

333
00:23:22,253 --> 00:23:25,055
我没办法不想到她 我睡不着…
I can't stop thinking about her. I can't sIeep--

334
00:23:25,323 --> 00:23:28,793
你知道吗? 你得尽力去争取
You know what? You have to go for it.

335
00:23:29,027 --> 00:23:34,132
你常遇到这种事吗? 你应该为自己这么做的
How often does this happen to you? You owe it to yourseIf.

336
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,802
你的温牛奶来了
Here's your warm miIk.

337
00:23:41,373 --> 00:23:44,443
我要回家 加点波本酒
I'm gonna put the bourbon in it at home.

338
00:23:46,445 --> 00:23:51,417
说真的 跟那个男的谈一谈,好吗?
Anyway, seriousIy, just taIk to the guy, okay?

339
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:54,019
告诉我结果
Let me know how it goes.

340
00:23:55,421 --> 00:23:57,355
是瑞秋
It's RacheI.

341
00:24:07,199 --> 00:24:10,369
你要生孩子了 你得做好准备
You're having a baby and you need to prepare.

342
00:24:10,569 --> 00:24:15,473
你得看完整只录影带 看吧
You're gonna make yourself watch the whole thing. Just do it!

343
00:24:18,677 --> 00:24:22,247
我来到这个大城市 希望成为大明星
I came to the big city to become a star.

344
00:24:22,882 --> 00:24:27,053
-为了圆梦我任何事都愿意做 -任何事?
-I'll do anything to make that happen. -Anything?

345
00:24:27,219 --> 00:24:31,757
或许我该从她 怎么怀孕开始看起
Maybe it starts with how she gets pregnant.

346
00:24:34,627 --> 00:24:37,096
不知道哪个男人 是孩子的爸
I wonder which one of these guys becomes the father.

347
00:24:40,367 --> 00:24:42,435
不 那样子是不会怀孕的
No, no. Can't get pregnant that way.
