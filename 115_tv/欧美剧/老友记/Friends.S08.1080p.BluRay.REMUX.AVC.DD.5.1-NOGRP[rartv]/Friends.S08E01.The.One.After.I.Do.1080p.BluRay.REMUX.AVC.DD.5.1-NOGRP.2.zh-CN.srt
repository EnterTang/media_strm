1
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:07,305
Oh, my God, we did it!

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,270
We just got married. Right there!

3
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:12,510
Is that your ring?

4
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:17,309
We're off to a good start.

5
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:21,886
- And, you sure you're not pregnant? 
- Yeah. I'm sure.

6
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:24,716
But if you're ready to have kids we got a room upstairs.

7
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:27,688
I mean, I'll blow off this party right now. I'll do it!

8
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:38,570
Okay, you guys, that ceremony was so beautiful.

9
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:42,263
Was it?! Was it perfect?! Is it too soon to see the video?!

10
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:47,905
Can we just please take a moment? 
Our two best friends just got married.

11
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:52,244
We are so blessed to be able to share in this incredible joy.

12
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:54,647
That is so true.

13
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:58,151
Mon, is it too late to switch from chicken to steak?

14
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:04,429
I'm so happy for you guys. And you are both so lucky!

15
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:07,998
I mean, you both said the right names

16
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,931
And nobody was drunk.

17
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:13,298
Okay.

18
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,031
And nobody was gay.

19
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,008
And on your first try.

20
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:30,821
The One After I Do

23
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:00,949
Great. Great. Just give me a sec to change film.

24
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:05,784
I know I'm not supposed to know, but I do and I'm so excited for you.

25
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:08,586
- What's going on? 
- Monica's pregnant.

26
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:13,060
Oh, my God. 
Is that why you guys had to get married?

27
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:17,559
- Guys, I'm not pregnant.
- Oh, slow swimmers?

28
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,005
What?! What do you mean? You're not pregnant?

29
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:25,609
- You didn't tell anybody I was, did you? 
- No.

30
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,177
I'll be right back.

31
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:31,272
You. Take a lot of pictures.

32
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,176
Why don't we get a shot of Monica and the bloody soldier.

33
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:37,151
About that, Joey, you have to change before the party.

34
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:40,417
- I can't. I don't have any other clothes here. 
- Find some, please.

35
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:44,358
Anything that doesn't say, "I died tragically in France."

36
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:47,197
- Fine!
- And be careful who you hug, okay?

37
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,564
My father's upstairs in tears because you got blood on his dress.

38
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:55,737
Why don't we see the bride and the groom, and the bridesmaids.

39
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,536
Hey, Mon, why'd you tell the guys that you weren't pregnant?

40
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:03,238
- Because I'm not.
- We found your tests.

41
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:05,007
If you're not pregnant...

42
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,580
...it's because I am.

43
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:14,860
What are you talking about?

44
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:18,360
Yes, I am with child.

45
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:22,157
I didn't want to say anything because it's your day.

46
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:26,031
- I didn't wanna steal your thunder. 
- So you told people I was pregnant?

47
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:29,270
Does this look like a conversation I want to remember?

48
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,278
- Who's the father?
- Yeah.

49
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:34,207
I can't say.

50
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:35,711
- Why?
- Why not?

51
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,510
I can't say because he's famous.

52
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,547
Oh, my God. Who is it?

53
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:45,621
Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.

54
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:48,953
Okay, okay, it's James Brolin.

55
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:53,058
James Brolin is the father of my baby.

56
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:56,393
As in Barbra Streisand's husband James Brolin?

57
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:58,368
What?!

58
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,670
Well, he never said that to me.

59
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,739
Monica, if you step away, we'll get Chandler and the bridesmaids.

60
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,879
How about just the bridesmaids?

61
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,379
I am the groom. I was told it was a big deal.

62
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,278
- It is.
- Yeah.

63
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:15,548
Oh, my God.

64
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,451
Thank you for that. I can't deal with the stress quite yet.

65
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,387
Instead you told me Monica was pregnant?

66
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,084
You said she was. I didn't disagree with you.

67
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,694
Sneaky.

68
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:26,956
Smile, ladies!

69
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:31,262
- By the way, James Brolin? 
- I know.

70
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:35,168
I could only think of two names: Him and Ed Begley Jr.

71
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:41,203
- Then I remembered he's gay, so... 
- Ed Begley Jr. Is not gay.

72
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:42,745
Really?

73
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:47,848
Congratulations!

74
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,716
Look who's married! And just in time too, I hear.

75
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:52,185
What? Ross!

76
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:58,029
So if you've got this all under control, I'm just gonna...

77
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:02,963
I just wanted you to know that you have made us happier

78
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:05,160
You have given us more joy...

79
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:06,963
I'm not pregnant.

80
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:08,367
What?

81
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,705
I'm not pregnant.

82
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:14,775
Oh, well.

83
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,980
But I did still get married today.

84
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:19,742
Whatever.

85
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,254
Thank you very much.

86
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:36,366
Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you:

87
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:38,969
Mr. And Mrs. Chandler Bing.

88
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:49,478
- Before we go out there, I got a present. 
- I'm not gonna put my hand in your pocket.

89
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,947
- No. I've been taking dancing lessons.
- What?

90
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:57,020
For the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you'd never forget.

91
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:58,713
That is so sweet.

92
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:02,189
So would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?

93
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,589
Yes.

94
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:11,662
- What's the matter? 
- It's these new shoes, they're all slippery.

95
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,431
- Are you gonna be able to do this? 
- Not well.

96
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:24,311
Well, the good news is, I don't think anyone's looking at us.

97
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:27,879
So are you ready to talk about it?

98
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:29,852
No.

99
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,689
Now?

100
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,321
No!

101
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,253
- We'll talk about something else then. 
- Thank you.

102
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:40,261
Who's the father?

103
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,530
Honey, I haven't told him yet...

104
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:46,330
...so, until I do, I don't think I should tell anybody else.

105
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:48,507
That's fine. That's fair.

106
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,732
- Is it Tag?
- Phoebe!

107
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:53,002
Okay, I'm sorry. I'll stop.

108
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,736
Is it Ross? It's Ross, isn't it?

109
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:57,711
- Oh, my God, it's Joey! 
- Stop it. Okay?

110
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,477
I am not gonna tell you until I tell him.

111
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,620
At least we know it's a him.

112
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,558
Oh, sweet Lord.

113
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,993
I'm sorry, okay? I went down to the gift shop.

114
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,259
It was either this or a bathrobe. What's more important:

115
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,801
The way I'm dressed, or being with you today?

116
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,496
Honey, I'm not gonna even pretend I was listening. Hey! Hey!

117
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:33,148
I'm Ross, I don't believe we met. I'm Monica's older brother.

118
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:36,321
Hi, I'm Mona from her restaurant.

119
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:40,056
Hello, Mona from her restaurant.

120
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,896
Mona. What a beautiful name.

121
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,761
You think so? I always kind of hated it.

122
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,096
Come on! Mona Lisa.

123
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,670
Mona...

124
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,305
...Llegglachen.

125
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:59,503
The famous botanist.

126
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:03,504
Oh, no, she's... Well, she's dead now, but...

127
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:08,387
Supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world.

128
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:09,747
Really?

129
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,925
- See, I never knew about her.
- Linda Llegglachen...

130
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:20,058
So, what table are you at?

131
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:23,262
Me too.

132
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:26,267
Good. Now there'll be someone there who likes my name.

133
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:28,201
Yes, there will.

134
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:39,641
Guess what, Molly Gilbert. 
You've just been bumped up to table one.

135
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:44,346
And if it's all right with you, I'll take your place at table six.

136
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,855
Martin Llegglachen.

137
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:52,387
That's better. Now, just bend your arms a little bit. 
Now look straight ahead.

138
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:55,863
This time I want you to really put your ass into it.

139
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:02,336
Who's slippery now?

140
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:07,839
Isn't that just the best feeling? 
Rubbing a fork on the bottom of your shoe?

141
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:12,484
Chandler, darling, look, my date has finally arrived.

142
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:17,246
I'd like you to meet Dennis Phillips. 
Dennis, this is my son, Chandler.

143
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:19,651
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

144
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,884
Dennis is a dear old friend...

145
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,892
...and a fantastic lover.

146
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,859
Are my ears bleeding?

147
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:33,900
Don't mind Chandler. He's always been shy.

148
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,301
Oh, you're right.

149
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:38,636
Bravo, Dennis. Thanks for pleasing my mother so.

150
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,409
I'm so sorry I missed the ceremony. I was stuck at auditions.

151
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:46,379
Yes, Dennis is directing a new Broadway show.

152
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:48,577
I don't believe we've met. Joey Tribbiani.

153
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:51,619
- Dennis Phillips. 
- I've admired your work for years.

154
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:54,655
- You've done some really amazing stuff. 
- Thank you.

155
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,260
If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go get myself a drink.

156
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:58,862
I'll be back in a moment.

157
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:02,832
Okay. You stop.

158
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:09,098
Dennis Phillips. That's great. 
How did you guys meet?

159
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:13,608
- Well, it's a funny story.
- Funny, "ha-ha"? Or funny:

160
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:26,891
Thank you. 
If everyone will please take your seats, dinner will be served.

161
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:42,368
- I thought you were at table six.
- No. Nine.

162
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:49,971
See, before, when you showed it to me, you held it that way...

163
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:52,514
...which was misleading.

164
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,391
Hello.

165
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:14,863
Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips?

166
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:20,171
Well, they've kind of locked themselves in one of the mers room stalls right now.

167
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,314
Perhaps when they get out.

168
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:26,943
If I could get in a Broadway show, then I would've done it all.

169
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,814
Film, television and theater.

170
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,286
The only thing left would be radio. But that's just for ugly people.

171
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:36,889
- What size shoes do you wear?
- 11, 11 half.

172
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:40,896
My shoes give me a problem on the dance floor. 
Can I borrow your boots?

173
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,001
I don't really even know where I left those.

174
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:49,702
- Those aren't 11 half.
- Okay, fine, I'm a 7!

175
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:54,039
I have surprisingly small feet. But the rest of me is good. 
I'll show you.

176
00:11:57,683 --> 00:12:00,243
Who am I kidding? I belong in radio.

177
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:08,023
- Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant? 
- Let's not talk about that right now.

178
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:11,956
- This is so huge. 
- Sure, but as big as your wedding?

179
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:14,462
Of course not. Nothing is.

180
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:18,098
Between me and you, in this day and age...

181
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,534
...how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?

182
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,836
Sometimes you can do everything right. 
Everyone wears what they're supposed to...

183
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,705
...and one of those little guys just gets through.

184
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,812
- How? 
- I don't know. Maybe they have tools.

185
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:36,317
Well, I talked to her, and she's definitely gonna have the baby.

186
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:39,218
She said she's gonna raise it on her own.

187
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,728
- Well, maybe that's really brave.
- Maybe.

188
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:46,056
I just hope she realizes how hard it's gonna be.

189
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,634
Maybe she hasn't really thought it through that much.

190
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:53,938
Well, there's a lot to think about.

191
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:59,201
How is she gonna handle this financially? 
How is she gonna juggle work?

192
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:04,212
Does she realize she's not gonna have a date again for the next, like, 18 years?

193
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:08,813
I don't know.

194
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,156
Are you okay?

195
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:18,089
I'm just thinking about Phoebe. Poor, knocked-up Phoebe.

196
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:22,132
- Champagne? 
- Oh, yes! Thank you very much.

197
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,382
That's actually how the French drink it.

198
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:46,651
Well, I just got off the phone with my lover James Brolin.

199
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:51,690
- Oh, really? 
- Apparently, he is married to some singer.

200
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:58,294
But he said he'd leave her for me. And I said, "James Brolin, are you sure?"

201
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,231
- James Brolin said... 
- Rachel's the one who's pregnant?

202
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:02,906
What?!

203
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,502
Why bother?

204
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:10,274
- How do you feel?
- I don't know how I feel.

205
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:14,885
This is all happening so fast. 
I have to make all these decisions that I don't wanna make.

206
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:17,412
Someone just take this away from me!

207
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:20,990
- Calm down. Maybe you're not pregnant.
- What?!

208
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:25,152
When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test, like, three times.

209
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:29,926
Yes. Maybe it's a false positive. 
Are you sure you peed on the stick right?

210
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,133
How many ways are there to do that?

211
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:37,066
I'm just saying, don't freak out until you're 100 percent sure.

212
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,670
All right, I'll take it again when I get home.

213
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,878
I can wait until then.

214
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,978
Oh, this is such a good party. How late does it go till?

215
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:51,985
- You gotta take it now. 
- No, this your wedding.

216
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:56,321
You're not gonna be able to have fun until we know. 
Do it as a present to me.

217
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:58,557
Okay, thank you.

218
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:01,790
- I'll run out and get you one. 
- You girls are so great.

219
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:05,265
- Wait a minute. Who's the father? 
- She won't tell us.

220
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,167
Come on! It's my wedding. That could be my present!

221
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:13,073
- I just gave you peeing on a stick. 
- See, this is why you register.

222
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,918
It was the chair again. Okay? I'm not doing it!

223
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:27,183
Dad. Can't you go back to your table?

224
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:33,623
No. 
Apparently little Molly Gilbert is enjoying her grown-up salmon en croute.

225
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,209
Look, I don't... You know what?

226
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,275
- Would you like to dance?
- Sure.

227
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:54,782
Great.

228
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,852
- Dr. Geller.
- I wasn't farting!

229
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,595
A little game from our table.

230
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,457
Dr. Geller, will you dance with me?

231
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:14,902
Maybe later. Right now, I'm about to dance with this lady.

232
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:23,945
Unless this lady wouldn't mind letting you go first.

233
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,777
I'd be happy to. You are very sweet.

234
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:29,848
Yes, I am.

235
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,958
In fact, let's try my special way. You can dance on my feet.

236
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,424
- Sure.
- Yeah? Hop on.

237
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,767
Is the pretty lady looking? Keep dancing.

238
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:59,312
And the world will never know.

239
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,048
Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?

240
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:06,713
I told him how talented you were and all about Days of our Lives.

241
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:11,055
You don't tell a Broadway guy that! Now he thinks I'm just a soap actor.

242
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,230
But you're not just a soap actor.

243
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:16,991
You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.

244
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:22,634
He has no idea what kind of range I have.

245
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:25,074
Don't move.

246
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:30,113
It's like he's running on tiny little pegs.

247
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,650
- Thank you. 
- No, thank you, Miranda.

248
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:40,324
- Melinda.
- All right.

249
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:46,223
- How cute was that? 
- Oh, were you watching?

250
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,333
Can I go next?

251
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:53,030
Of course you can. Hop on.

252
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:56,071
Okay, but I get to hop on after her.

253
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:05,344
- I am so gonna score.
- What?

254
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:07,678
I like your bow.

255
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:16,991
I'd like to propose a toast to Monica and Chandler...

256
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:21,359
...the greatest couple in the world, and my best friends.

257
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:26,095
When I first found out they were getting married, I was a little angry.

258
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:31,208
I was like, "Why, God? Why? 
How can you take them away from me!"

259
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:38,416
But then I thought back over all our memories together. 
Some happy memories.

260
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,351
And there were some sad memories.

261
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,160
I'm sorry.

262
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:52,261
And some scared memories.

263
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:02,998
And then I realized I'll always be their friend.

264
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,700
Their friend who can speak in many dialects...

265
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:11,315
...and has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity.

266
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,713
To the happy couple.

267
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,190
- Thank you. 
- That was very nice, Ashley.

268
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:26,364
- Can we do it again?
- No, no.

269
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:31,332
- So, is it my turn now?
- I'm next.

270
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:38,404
- That's okay, you can dance with her first. 
- Are you sure?

271
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:43,239
- So, what's your name?
- Gert.

272
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:45,313
That's pretty.

273
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,056
What are you doing there, Gert?

274
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:58,554
Dancing on your feet like the other girls did it.

275
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:04,261
Hop on, Gert.

276
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:12,335
- Why aren't you moving your feet? 
- I'm trying.

277
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:17,013
Faster. You're not going fast enough.

278
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,741
Maybe I should stand on your feet!

279
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,659
So did you happen to catch my toast up there?

280
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:32,455
- Oh, my God. That was for my benefit? 
- There was a little something for everyone.

281
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:37,897
- I know you're casting for this new show. 
- I don't think you're right for this project.

282
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:39,570
You're wrong.

283
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:43,434
Whatever it is, I can do it. If you didn't see it up there, just try me.

284
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:47,578
It's an all Chinese cast. Can you be Chinese?

285
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:54,075
- Well, I'm not proud of this, but... 
- Oh, my God. Please don't!

286
00:20:56,288 --> 00:21:00,122
- Ready to get back to the dance floor? 
- Did it turn into sand?

287
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:05,456
- Come on, I love this song. You'll be fine. 
- No. No, I won't.

288
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,263
Do you know why I took all those lessons?

289
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:12,870
I didn't want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor...

290
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:14,470
...with some clumsy idiot.

291
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,438
Oh, sweetie, you could never embarrass me.

292
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:22,012
Okay, you could easily embarrass me. But it doesn't matter, all right?

293
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:23,647
I married you.

294
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:26,908
No matter what you do, I'm gonna come home with you, okay?

295
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:30,121
So I'm gonna dance on my wedding night with my husband. 
Come on.

296
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:35,054
But I'll tell you, that's the last time I buy shoes at the Slippery Fun Shoe store.

297
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,757
Just try not to move your feet at all.

298
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:48,305
There you go.

299
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:52,608
- I'm gonna have you arrested.
- Why?

300
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,244
You stole my moves!

301
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:00,717
Oh, Chandler, you're quite the dancer!

302
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:04,920
- Thanks, Mrs. Geller. 
- Oh, come on, you can call me Mom.

303
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:06,684
Really?

304
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:08,052
I will.

305
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,598
Sorry, Mom.

306
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:28,546
- How much longer?
- 30 seconds.

307
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:30,305
Thirty seconds, okay...

308
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,176
Did I miss it?

309
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:42,417
I want you to know that if it's positive, we're gonna...

310
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:45,357
- I know. I know.
- You do. Okay.

311
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,357
It's time.

312
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:56,398
Go ahead, Rach.

313
00:22:57,109 --> 00:23:01,478
Wait. You know what? I can't look at it. 
Somebody else tell me.

314
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:07,612
It's negative.

315
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:11,889
- What?
- It's negative.

316
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,999
Well, there you go.

317
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:30,830
That is... That's great. That is really great, great news.

318
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,977
You know, because the whole...

319
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:42,083
...not being ready and, kind of, the financial aspects, all that...

320
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:48,482
This is so just the way that this was supposed to be.

321
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,621
Then, great.

322
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:59,562
God, this is so stupid.

323
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:05,106
How can I be upset over something I never had?

324
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:09,574
- It's negative?
- No, it's positive.

325
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:18,211
- What?
- It's not negative, it's positive.

326
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:22,621
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I lied before.

327
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:31,130
- Now you know how you really feel about it. 
- That's a risky little game.

328
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,501
Are you really gonna do this?

329
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:39,271
Yeah.

330
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:41,308
I'm gonna have a baby.

331
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:44,348
I'm gonna have a baby.

332
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,414
I'm gonna have a baby!

333
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:55,856
- With who?
- No, it's still not the time.

334
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:06,427
I just didn't see the fast song coming.

335
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:10,540
Don't talk, we'll get you up to your room, soak your feet. 
You'll be okay.

336
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:13,243
- Thank you.
- That is so sweet!

337
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:16,936
No, I mean it. 
There are so few genuinely nice guys out there.

338
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:20,777
Tell me about it. I feel like I'm holding down the fort by myself.

339
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,086
- It's Joey, right?
- Yeah.

340
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:25,950
Wait a minute! No!

341
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:27,624
I'm the nice one!

342
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:31,853
I'm the one that danced with the kids all night. I...

343
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:33,894
How small are your feet?!
