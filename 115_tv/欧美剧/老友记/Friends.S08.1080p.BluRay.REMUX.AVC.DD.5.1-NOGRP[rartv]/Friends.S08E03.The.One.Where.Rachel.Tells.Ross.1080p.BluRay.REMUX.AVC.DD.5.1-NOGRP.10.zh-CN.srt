7
00:00:25,711 --> 00:00:29,442
我没有迷你泳裤
Speedo? I don't have a Speedo.

8
00:00:29,615 --> 00:00:33,984
我要去打包 我那不起眼的超长泳裤

I so wanted Ross to know first. But I am so reIieved that you guys know!

-You're aII gonna be aunts and uncIes. -Yeah, but I'm the onIy one reIated by bIood.

21
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:25,934
现在你们知道了,你们可以帮我 建议我该怎么跟罗斯说
So now that you aII know, you can heIp me. Give me some advice on how to teII Ross.

22
00:01:26,105 --> 00:01:27,436
你打算怎么说?
What were you gonna say?

23
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,940
我要告诉他我想留下孩子 他想怎么做都可以
I was gonna teII him that I'm gonna have it, and he can be as invoIved as he wants.

24
00:01:32,111 --> 00:01:33,840
听起来很不错
WeII, that sounds good.

25
00:01:34,013 --> 00:01:38,473

那是怎么一回事?
Hey, what was that aII about?

29
00:01:50,396 --> 00:01:54,696

Guess there's no harm in teIIing you now. RacheI and Ross are going to have a baby.

30
00:01:54,867 --> 00:02:00,567

我不会告诉你 因为我是保密高手
I'm not gonna teII you, because I am an exceIIent secret-keeper.

-What? They took mine to give to you. -Why wouId they take away our keys?

52
00:03:39,305 --> 00:03:40,772
或许他们不信任我们
Maybe they don't trust us.

53
00:03:40,973 --> 00:03:43,874
他们上次出城时 让我保管他们的钥匙
They Iet me keep my key the Iast time they were out of town.

54
00:03:44,043 --> 00:03:48,912
那次你打破蕃茄酱瓶 拿摩妮卡给客人的毛巾来清理?
The time you broke the ketchup bottIe and cIeaned it with Monica's guest toweIs?

55
00:03:49,148 --> 00:03:51,708

Listen, I need to get into Monica and ChandIer's apartment. It's an emergency!

64
00:04:14,607 --> 00:04:17,667
瓦斯漏气,带大蒜面包过来
Gas Ieak. Oh, and bring garIic bread.

65
00:04:20,846 --> 00:04:23,371

-Hey, did Monica and ChandIer take off yet? -Yeah.

66
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:28,682
该死,他们没有带 纳索化石与天然历史博物馆的通行证
Damn. They Ieft without my pass to the Nassau FossiI and NaturaI History Museum.

67
00:04:29,455 --> 00:04:31,650
他们的蜜月泡汤了
There goes the honeymoon.

68
00:04:31,991 --> 00:04:34,391
-瑞秋找到你了吗? -不,怎么了?
-Did RacheI find you? -No, why?

69
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,224
她在找你
She was Iooking for you.

70
00:04:37,429 --> 00:04:40,364
那么我待会再见她
WeII, I guess I'II catch up with her Iater.

71
00:04:41,033 --> 00:04:45,868
-她真的得马上跟你谈 -对,似乎是有重要的事
-She reaIIy wanted to taIk to you now. -Yeah, it seemed pretty important.

72
00:04:48,274 --> 00:04:49,832
不
Oh, no.

73
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:51,442
什么?
What?

74
00:04:52,111 --> 00:04:54,978
我想我知道她有什么事
I think I might know what this is about.

75
00:04:57,082 --> 00:04:58,379
真的吗?
ReaIIy?

76
00:04:58,584 --> 00:05:04,079
对,我们答应不会告诉任何人 但是…
Yeah. We promised we weren't gonna teII anybody this, but....

77
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:09,049
大约一个月前 瑞秋跟我上床
About a month ago, RacheI and I sIept together.

78
00:05:09,595 --> 00:05:11,062
结果呢?
And?

79
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,131
我以为 你们会大吃一惊
Wow, I thought you'd be a IittIe more shocked.

80
00:05:18,704 --> 00:05:21,172
抱歉…结果呢?
Oh, sorry. And?!

81
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:29,413
我们说 只做一次…
WeII, we said we'd just do it that one time...

82
00:05:29,582 --> 00:05:33,484
我想她或许 想要跟我复合
...but now I think she may wanna start things up again.

83
00:05:33,652 --> 00:05:36,348
我想不是那样的
Yeah, I don't think that's what it is.

84
00:05:37,323 --> 00:05:42,317
-为什么?不然会是什么事? -我觉得不太舒服
-Why? What eIse couId it be? -Oh, wow, I don't feeI weII.

85
00:05:44,163 --> 00:05:47,257
我相信就是那么一回事
I'm teIIing you, that's what it is.

86
00:05:47,466 --> 00:05:51,562
难怪在婚礼上 她看我的眼神怪怪的
No wonder she was Iooking at me aII funny during the wedding.

87
00:05:52,571 --> 00:05:54,732
她什么都没有告诉你们?
She didn't say anything to you?

88
00:05:54,974 --> 00:05:57,568
-或许你吃错东西了 -有可能
-Maybe it's something you ate. -CouId be, yeah.

89
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:02,341
-拜,去跟瑞秋谈一谈 -好吧
-PIease, just go and taIk to RacheI. -Yeah, I guess I shouId.

90
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,241
你们知道我领悟到什么事吗?
Man, you know what I have to reaIize?

91
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:12,186
或许我是那种 让女人一夜难忘的男人
Maybe I'm not the type of guy women can have just one night with.

92
00:06:13,158 --> 00:06:17,959
她们对我 永远都觉得不满足
You know, they aIways seem to want a IittIe bit more.

93
00:06:19,531 --> 00:06:21,624
我应该记得那一点的
I shouId remember that.

94
00:06:31,277 --> 00:06:32,904
下一位
Next.

95
00:06:33,712 --> 00:06:37,409
-他们在接吻,我们先过去吧 -别管他们,他们深爱彼此
-They're kissing. Let's just go around them. -Leave them aIone. They're in Iove.

96
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:41,019
我也爱你,不过爱得井然有序
I'm in Iove too. But in an orderIy fashion.

97
00:06:41,186 --> 00:06:42,551
下一位
Next.

98
00:06:42,721 --> 00:06:46,521
嗨,你们能边走边接吻吗? 因为她说“下一位”
Hi. Can you do that and waIk? Because she said, ''Next.''

99
00:06:47,026 --> 00:06:51,622
抱歉,我们没有听到 我们要去度蜜月
Sorry, we didn't hear you. We're on our honeymoon.

100
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:57,860
让我来看一下 头等舱还有位置
Let me see what I can do. There are some first-cIass seats avaiIabIe.

101
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:01,699
她让他们升级到头等舱 因为他们要去度蜜月
They bumped them up to first cIass because they're on their honeymoon!

102
00:07:01,874 --> 00:07:06,334
-我们假装也要去度蜜月 -我们的确是要去度蜜月
-Let's act Iike we're on our honeymoon. -We are on our honeymoon.

103
00:07:06,512 --> 00:07:08,275
快摸我屁股
Grab my ass.

104
00:07:09,682 --> 00:07:12,708
-下一位 -抱歉,我差点没听见
-Next. -Hi. Sorry, I aImost didn't hear you.

105
00:07:12,885 --> 00:07:17,254
我深爱我的新丈夫 我们要去度蜜月
You know, I'm just so in Iove with my new husband. We're on our honeymoon.

106
00:07:17,423 --> 00:07:19,288
-恭喜 -谢谢
-CongratuIations. -Thanks.

107
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:24,657
好了,宾先生,你在25J 宾太太是25K
Okay, Mr. Bing, you'II be in 25J, and Mrs. Bing, you're in 25K.

108
00:07:24,863 --> 00:07:29,562
我们要去度蜜月 你能让我们升级到头等舱吗?
We're on our honeymoon, so can you do your IittIe thing and bump us to first cIass?

109
00:07:29,735 --> 00:07:33,501
抱歉,头等舱客满了 刚刚那对夫妻拿走最后两个位置
I'm sorry, aII the first-cIass seats are taken. That coupIe got the Iast two.

110
00:07:33,672 --> 00:07:39,372
看吧?如果你听我的话＝插他们的队 她会给我们头等舱的位置,该死
See? If we'd gone around them Iike I said, she'd have given us those tickets! Damn it!

111
00:07:39,545 --> 00:07:43,345
25J跟K 会不会刚好不连在一起?
25J and K, any chance those aren't together?

112
00:07:51,657 --> 00:07:55,616
我还是不敢相信他们拿走我的钥匙 你都把你的钥匙交给我保管
I stiII can't beIieve they took away my key. I mean, you trust me with yours.

113
00:07:55,794 --> 00:07:58,354
那当然 我会把它还给你…
Of course I do! And I'm gonna get it back to you...

114
00:07:58,564 --> 00:08:02,227
只要清理钥匙的人 把它擦干净了
...just as soon as they're done with it at the key-shining pIace.

115
00:08:06,004 --> 00:08:08,165
-那是什么声音? -我不知道
-What the heII is that? -I don't know.

116
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,608
崔格,你在做什么?
Treeger, what are you doing?

117
00:08:11,777 --> 00:08:14,507
-你说有瓦斯漏气 -你为什么不用钥匙开门?
-You said there was a gas Ieak. -Why not use your key?

118
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,138
等我找到他们家的钥匙 这间公寓可能都炸掉了
By the time I found it on this thing, the whoIe pIace might have expIoded.

119
00:08:18,317 --> 00:08:21,980
如果我管理的公寓再发生一次爆炸意外 人们会开始问问题
If that happens at another buiIding I manage, peopIe wiII ask questions.

120
00:08:22,154 --> 00:08:23,815
快一点
Come on, hurry up!

121
00:08:26,825 --> 00:08:29,157
要那么做我们也会
WeII, we couId have done that.

122
00:08:32,097 --> 00:08:35,464
你看 他们走进头等舱休息室了
Look at that! They're going into the first-cIass Iounge.

123
00:08:35,634 --> 00:08:37,625
-你知道里面有什么吗? -不知道
-Do you know what they have in there? -No.

124

我也不知道,我们得进去才行
Me neither. We have to get in!

125
00:08:42,074 --> 00:08:45,771
-装做你是头等舱的客人 -天啊,有橘子
-Just act Iike you beIong. -Oh, my God! Oranges!

126
00:08:47,746 --> 00:08:52,240

-Nice to see you again. -Sir, may I see your tickets, pIease?

127
00:08:53,018 --> 00:08:54,747
没问题
Yes, of course.

128
00:08:55,854 --> 00:08:58,448
麻烦将你的姆指挪开 我看不到座位号码
WouId you move your thumb? I can't see the seat number.

129
00:08:58,624 --> 00:09:01,684
没关系 我已经背起来了,是1A
That's aII right. I have it memorized. It's 1 A.

130
00:09:04,396 --> 00:09:08,332
-这不是头等舱的机票,抱歉 -没关系,对不起
-Sir, this isn't a first-cIass ticket. I'm sorry. -ApoIogy accepted. Excuse us.

131
00:09:08,534 --> 00:09:12,868
先生 恐怕我得请你们离开
Sir, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to Ieave.

132
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,306
好吧
Fine.

133
00:09:16,775 --> 00:09:18,936
快跑
Go, go!

134
00:09:31,557 --> 00:09:33,047
-嗨 -嗨

00:09:33,425 --> 00:09:34,687
嗨
Hi.

136
00:09:36,161 --> 00:09:39,392
我想我们真的需要 好好地谈一谈
I think there's something that we reaIIy need to taIk about.

137
00:09:39,598 --> 00:09:43,625
没错,我们先进去吧
I think we do. Why don't we go inside.

138
00:09:49,408 --> 00:09:54,072
-听着,我知道你为什么会来这里 -真的?
-Look, I know why you're here. -You do?

139
00:09:54,246 --> 00:09:57,443
对 为了让你有点面子…
Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment...

140
00:09:57,616 --> 00:10:00,551
我想或许应该我先说
...I think maybe I shouId taIk first.

141
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:02,152
-好吧 -好吗?
-Okay. -Okay?

142
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,130
罗斯跟瑞秋
Ross and RacheI.

143
00:10:14,299 --> 00:10:16,290
瑞秋跟罗斯
RacheI and Ross.

144
00:10:18,504 --> 00:10:22,065
那像是在玩跷跷板 对吧?
That's been one heck of a seesaw, hasn't it?

145
00:10:23,308 --> 00:10:24,570
什么?
What?

146
00:10:25,244 --> 00:10:31,513
我是说那晚 我们过得既满足又尽性
I mean, Iook, that one night we had was fun and certainIy passionate.

147
00:10:31,683 --> 00:10:36,143
但你不觉得 我们还是当朋友比较好吗?
But don't you think it's better if we just stay friends?

148
00:10:37,489 --> 00:10:39,423
你是说…什么?
SeriousIy, what?

149
00:10:40,859 --> 00:10:44,226
好吧,这样好了
Okay. You know what?

150
00:10:44,463 --> 00:10:49,196
如果你要的话 我们可以再做一次
If you want to, we can do it one more time.

151
00:10:51,136 --> 00:10:55,505
我没有问题 事实上我现在有空…
I mean, I'd be okay with that. In fact, I have some time right now--

152
00:10:55,674 --> 00:10:56,732
好了
Okay.

153
00:10:56,942 --> 00:10:58,876
你知道吗?我可以说话了吗?
You know what? Can I taIk now?

154
00:10:59,044 --> 00:11:00,944
-当然可以 -好吧
-Oh, sure. -Okay.

155
00:11:07,386 --> 00:11:09,115
我怀孕了
I'm pregnant.

156
00:11:13,692 --> 00:11:15,023
罗斯
Ross?

157
00:11:19,932 --> 00:11:21,365
罗斯
Ross?

158
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:25,234
好吧,我等你准备好再说
Okay, whenever you're ready.

159
00:11:32,244 --> 00:11:35,179
对了,你是孩子的爸 但你有…
And you're the father, by the way. But you got--

160
00:11:39,851 --> 00:11:43,810
-你要喝水吗? -我没事
-Can I get you some water? -I'm good.

161
00:11:44,456 --> 00:11:50,486
罗斯,别觉得有什么压力,好吗? 你想怎么做都可以的
Ross, there is no pressure on you, okay? I mean, you can be as invoIved as you want.

162
00:11:54,266 --> 00:11:56,359
对,我…
Yeah, I....

163
00:11:56,568 --> 00:12:00,004
我只是不知道… 我不了解…
I'm just, I don't know. I don't understand...

164
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,108
怎么会发生这种事
...how this happened.

165
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:10,071
-我们有用保险套 -我知道
-We used a condom. -I know.

166
00:12:10,248 --> 00:12:15,379
但保险套的避孕功能 只有百分之九十七
But you know, condoms onIy work, Iike, 97 percent of the time.

167
00:12:15,754 --> 00:12:17,415
什么?
What?

168
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,217
什么?
What?!

169
00:12:22,427 --> 00:12:26,158
他们应该标示在包装上
WeII, they shouId put that on the box!

170
00:12:28,634 --> 00:12:31,194
-包装上有标示 -才没有
-They do. -No, they don't!

171
00:12:37,309 --> 00:12:41,575
他们应该用又大又粗的字体 标示在包装上
WeII, they shouId put it in huge bIock Ietters!

172
00:12:41,747 --> 00:12:47,117
-罗斯,别管保险套的事 -早知道当时也不用管了
-Ross, Iet's just forget about the condoms. -WeII, I may as weII have!

173
00:12:48,954 --> 00:12:51,718
听着,你知道吗? 我发现自己怀孕时…
Listen, you know what? I was reaIIy freaked out too...

174
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:54,688
-也吓坏了 -吓坏了?我才没有
-...when I found out. -Freaked--? Hey, I'm not freaked out.

175
00:12:55,861 --> 00:12:59,126
我是个愤怒的消费者
I'm indignant as a consumer!

176
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:04,899
-你知道吗?我们待会再谈 -不,我想现在谈
-You know what? Let's taIk Iater. -No, I wanna taIk now.

177
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:07,231
事实上我想…
In fact, I wanna taIk...

178
00:13:07,406 --> 00:13:11,536
跟保险套公司的 董事长谈
...to the president of the condom company.

179
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:14,144
你知道吗? 或许我该待会再来…好吧
Okay, you know what? Maybe I shouId come back-- Okay.

180
00:13:15,414 --> 00:13:17,712
好吧,我按一
Yeah, I'II press one!

181
00:13:21,653 --> 00:13:27,285
-我到处找过,瓦斯没有漏气 -我可以热一下这个吗?
-I Iooked everywhere. There's no gas Ieak. -So then I can heat this up?

182
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:30,257
总之我会帮他们 装扇新门
Anyway, I'II get moving on that new door.

183
00:13:30,462 --> 00:13:35,399
太棒了,你能帮我们一个忙 别跟钱德和摩妮卡提这件事吗?
Great. Listen, couId you do us a favor and not teII ChandIer and Monica about this?

184
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,297
因为他们没有 自己的孩子…
Because, you know, they don't have any kids of their own...

185
00:13:39,471 --> 00:13:42,770
这扇门就像是他们的孩子
...and this door was Iike a chiId to them.

186
00:13:43,942 --> 00:13:47,241
我得装上新锁 他们一定会发现的
WeII, I'm gonna have to put on a new Iock. They'II find out anyway.

187
00:13:48,714 --> 00:13:53,674
看样子要干一整天 我得去取消我的瑜珈课
It's Iooking Iike an aII-day job. I'm gonna have to canceI my yoga cIass.

188
00:13:54,052 --> 00:13:57,385
罗斯,麻烦你告诉茉莉 今天我没办法去上瑜珈课
Hey, Ross. CouId you teII Jasmine I can't make it to yoga cIass today?

189
00:13:57,556 --> 00:13:58,818
没问题
Sure.

190
00:14:04,262 --> 00:14:08,221
-天啊,门是怎么了? -很明显喔?
-Oh, my God! What happened to the door? -So it's noticeabIe, huh?

191
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,361
-瑞秋在这里吗?我得跟她谈一谈 -你们不是谈过了吗?
-Look, is RacheI here? I need to taIk to her. -Didn't you two aIready taIk?

192
00:14:12,571 --> 00:14:14,129
对,但是…
Yeah, but--

193
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,541
听着,你们知道 瑞秋跟我上过床…
Okay. Look, you guys know that RacheI and I sIept together...

194
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,769
但除此之外还有别的
...but there's something eIse.

195
00:14:22,781 --> 00:14:24,180
瑞秋怀孕了
RacheI's pregnant.

196
00:14:24,349 --> 00:14:27,182
-我的老天爷 -天啊,我不敢相信
-HoIy mother of God! -Oh, my God, I can't beIieve that!

197
00:14:30,322 --> 00:14:34,918
-她怀了我的孩子 -我是第一次听到这件事
-With my chiId. -That is brand-new information!

198
00:14:39,331 --> 00:14:42,391
-你们已经知道了对不对? -知道一点
-You aIready know, don't you? -LittIe bit.

199
00:14:43,201 --> 00:14:47,001
-你还好吗? -我会没事的
-How you doing? -Okay. I mean, I'II be okay.

200
00:14:47,172 --> 00:14:49,640
我想 我没有处理好
It's just, I don't think I handIed it very weII.

201
00:14:49,808 --> 00:14:52,140
-你跟她说了什么? -什么都没说
-What'd you say to her? -Nothing.

202
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:56,440
但我跟保险公司的客服部门 说了很多
But the compIaint department at the condom company got an earfuI.

203
00:14:57,115 --> 00:14:59,982
-我一转身才发现她走了 -罗斯
-Then when I turned around, she was gone. -Oh, Ross.

204
00:15:00,152 --> 00:15:05,988
我知道,但我刚刚才发现 保险套只有百分之九十七的避孕效果
I know. But in my defense, I just found out that condoms are onIy, Iike, 97% effective.

205
00:15:06,158 --> 00:15:08,922
-什么? -我得去找她
-What? -I gotta go find her.

206
00:15:09,094 --> 00:15:12,063
等一下,你是认真的?
Hey. HoId on! Are you serious?

207
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:15,324
所以有百分之三的机率 它们无法发挥功能?
So, Iike, 3 percent of the time, they don't even work?

208
00:15:16,868 --> 00:15:19,564
他们应该在包装上做标示
They shouId put that on the box!

209
00:15:20,705 --> 00:15:23,401
-他们的确那么做了 -什么?
-EvidentIy, they do. -What?!

210
00:15:29,214 --> 00:15:31,045
真的咧
WeII, I'II be.

211
00:15:38,957 --> 00:15:42,393
-我不敢相信我们来到这里了 -开什么玩笑
-I can't beIieve we're here. -You've gotta be kidding.

212
00:15:42,561 --> 00:15:44,119
什么?
What?

213
00:15:46,031 --> 00:15:49,967

Because that's your answer to everything?

246
00:18:18,483 --> 00:18:21,350
不,那么做是对的
No. Because that's the right thing to do.

247
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:27,116
或许吧,只要我们相爱 罗斯,我们并不相爱,对吧?
Yeah, maybe, if you're in Iove. But Ross, we are not in Iove, are we?

248
00:18:27,292 --> 00:18:32,924
对,但是 你不可能一个人这么做
No. But stiII, I mean, you can't possibIy do this aIone.

249
00:18:33,365 --> 00:18:34,696
你说什么?
Excuse me?

250
00:18:34,866 --> 00:18:40,361
-你甚至没办法一个人到餐厅吃饭 -什么?
-You can't even eat aIone in a restaurant. -What?

251
00:18:40,572 --> 00:18:44,440
如果你没办法一个人吃饭 你怎么一个人带孩子?
If you can't eat by yourseIf, how do you expect to have a baby by yourseIf?

252
00:18:44,609 --> 00:18:48,204
-我可以一个人吃饭 -你什么时候那么做过?
-I can too eat by myseIf! -When have you ever?

253
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:53,044
当某些同桌的人吃完饭 我还没有吃完的时候
When certain peopIe Ieave the tabIe and I am not finished!

254
00:18:53,218 --> 00:18:56,710
有些人光喝一碗汤 就得花掉两个小时
WeII, certain other peopIe take two hours to eat a bowI of soup!

255
00:18:56,888 --> 00:18:59,152
拜,你是狼谆⒀
Oh, pIease. You inhaIe your food.

256
00:18:59,324 --> 00:19:03,351
我跟摩妮卡一起长大 不吃快一点的话就没得吃了
I grew up with Monica. If you didn't eat fast, you didn't eat!

257
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:08,060
我打扰你们了吗?
Am I interrupting?

258
00:19:08,266 --> 00:19:11,929
不,朗格医生,请进 他是罗斯,孩子的爸爸
No, Dr. Long. PIease come in. This is Ross. He is the father.

259
00:19:12,103 --> 00:19:15,630
但我不是她的丈夫 因为显然她能单独带大孩子
But not the husband, because, evidentIy, she can do this aIone.

260
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:19,943
很高兴能见到你,我要开始检查了
Nice to meet you. I'II get started on this.

261
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:27,117
-你为什么不能承认你需要我? -我需要你站在床头这边
-Why you can't admit you need me? -I need you to stay near my head!

262
00:19:28,787 --> 00:19:34,123
好吧,看起来很正常 银幕上的画面是这样的
Okay. Everything Iooks good. Here it is on the screen.

263
00:19:34,492 --> 00:19:37,154
这是你的子宫…
Here's your uterus...

264
00:19:37,362 --> 00:19:41,423
宝宝在这里
...and right here is your baby.

265
00:19:43,001 --> 00:19:44,935
天啊
Oh, my God.

266
00:19:49,074 --> 00:19:51,440
它在那里,我看到了
There it is. I see it.

267
00:19:51,609 --> 00:19:55,045
恭喜 我让你们独处一下
CongratuIations. I'II give you two a minute.

268
00:19:55,213 --> 00:19:57,477
-好吧 -谢谢
-Okay. -Thank you.

269
00:20:04,923 --> 00:20:07,118
很神奇吧?
Pretty amazing, huh?

270
00:20:07,492 --> 00:20:09,790
我看不到它
I don't see it!

271
00:20:17,902 --> 00:20:21,861
-什么? -我看不到它
-What? -I can't see it.

272
00:20:22,373 --> 00:20:24,364
但你说你看到了
But you just said that you did.

273
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:28,103
我知道,我说谎 我不希望她认为我是个很糟糕的母亲
I know. I Iied. I didn't want her to think I was a terribIe mother.

274
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:30,076
我连自己的宝宝都看不到
I can't even see my own baby!

275
00:20:30,248 --> 00:20:36,278
当然,过来,你可以看到的 过来,就在这里
Oh, sure. Come here. Sure, you can. Come here. Look, it's right there.

276
00:20:41,826 --> 00:20:44,192
好漂亮
Oh, it's beautifuI.

277
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:47,054
我看到了
I see it now.

278
00:20:48,633 --> 00:20:51,625
-真的吗? -不,我看不到
-Do you reaIIy? -No, I don't see it!

279
00:20:51,903 --> 00:20:54,929
好吧,来吧
Okay. Come on. AII right. Okay.

280
00:20:55,106 --> 00:21:00,544
你看到那个像花生一样的 小东西了吗?
You see this tiny thing that Iooks Iike a peanut?

281
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:02,307
是的
Yeah.

282
00:21:03,214 --> 00:21:05,011
甜心,就是那个
Sweetie, that's it.

283
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,211
就是那个?
That's it?

284
00:21:07,785 --> 00:21:09,946
我看到了
WeII, I saw that.

285
00:21:15,994 --> 00:21:18,428
-谢谢 -别客气
-Thank you. -You're weIcome.

286
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:26,361
我不敢相信那是我们的孩子
Wow, I can't beIieve that's our baby.

287
00:21:28,873 --> 00:21:32,138
对,那是我们的孩子
Yeah, that's our baby.

288
00:21:39,617 --> 00:21:41,244
他们装了新门
WeII, they put up the new door.

289
00:21:41,486 --> 00:21:44,478
-门都锁好了吗? -对,怎么了?
-So it's aII Iocked up and secure? -Yeah. Why?

290
00:21:44,856 --> 00:21:49,122
我想知道我有多想吃 摩妮卡的火鸡肉派
I was trying to figure out how bad I want one of Monica's turkey pot pies.

291
00:21:50,361 --> 00:21:52,454
-嗨 -嘿
-Hi. -Hey.

292
00:21:52,664 --> 00:21:55,861
-医生怎么说? -一切都很顺利
-So how was the doctor? -Everything went great.

293
00:21:56,067 --> 00:21:59,559
-很好 -让他们看看你子宫的照片
-Good. -Hey, show them the picture of your uterus.

294
00:22:05,577 --> 00:22:07,374
我看不到宝宝,它在哪里?
I don't see the baby. Where is it?

295
00:22:07,545 --> 00:22:11,379
不,我知道,刚开始我也看不到 但它就在…
Oh, no, I know. I couIdn't see it either at first. But it's right....

296
00:22:12,917 --> 00:22:15,147
罗斯,我又看不到了
Ross, I Iost it again.
