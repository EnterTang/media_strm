1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,801
我们买了纸巾吗?
Did we get paper toweIs?

2
00:00:03,968 --> 00:00:06,003
你是指我们打算 去店里买的东西吗?

00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:07,604
没有

10
00:00:30,562 --> 00:00:32,631
我不知道该把它放到哪里去
I didn't know where to put it.

11
00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:36,602
-我们可以把它放在客房 -好吧
-We can put it in the guest bedroom. -Yeah, okay.

14
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:47,714
我小时候 都待在游乐场里

00:00:55,255 --> 00:01:00,427
把铜板放进去 一拉把手,就能拿到糖果
You'd put a quarter in, puII some handIes and win a candy bar.

18
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:02,896
自动贩卖机?
A vending machine?

19
00:01:03,097 --> 00:01:06,867
别为我难过 每次我都会赢
Don't feeI bad for me. I won every time!

Do you think he saw us, or can we stiII sIip out?

24
00:01:54,551 --> 00:01:58,655
系主任诺曼教授 要退休了,所以…
Professor Newman, the department head, is retiring, so....

25
00:01:58,922 --> 00:02:03,994
-他们让你当系主任 -我要教他的高级课
-They made you head of the department! -I'm teaching his advanced cIass!

26
00:02:05,062 --> 00:02:07,598
我为什么没有当上系主任?
Why didn't I get head of the department?

27
00:02:07,765 --> 00:02:10,301
太棒了 你一直想教高级课
Great. You've aIways wanted to teach an advanced cIass.

...was the break Professor Newman was waiting for.

32
00:02:18,343 --> 00:02:20,312
不是诺曼教授 在等待的机会

33
00:02:20,478 --> 00:02:21,479
但是…
But, hey.

34
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:25,884
瑞秋,我有个重要约会 你知道哪家餐厅不错吗?

带她到四季饭店喝东西

39
00:02:38,732 --> 00:02:42,035
或是到城里听爵士乐

或跳舞,带她去跳舞

41
00:02:45,038 --> 00:02:48,574
你真的很会拖延性爱游戏
You sure are naming a Iot of ways to postpone sex.

42
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:53,847
我想念约会的感觉 盛装打扮去好餐厅吃饭
I miss dating. Dressing up, going to a fancy restaurant.

43
00:02:54,548 --> 00:02:58,952
我很久都无法再那么做了 那真的很有趣
I won't be abIe to do that for so Iong. And it's so much fun.

44
00:02:59,386 --> 00:03:03,857
我不是说坐在这里 担心生产的事不好玩
Not that sitting around worrying about giving birth isn't fun.

45
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,063
知道吗?我们为什么不去约会?
Hey, you know what? Why don't I take you out.

46
00:03:09,364 --> 00:03:12,300
你不想跟孕妇约会
You don't want to date a pregnant Iady.

47
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,302
我想我们会玩得很开心
Yes, I do. We're gonna have a good time.

48
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:20,007
我会让你忘了生孩子剖腹生产…
I'II take your mind off of chiIdbirth, and C-sections...

49
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,477
宝宝的头扩大了…
...and baby heads stretching out--

50
00:03:22,711 --> 00:03:24,345
好吧,我答应你
Okay, I'II go with you.

51
00:03:24,546 --> 00:03:26,982
-那会很好玩的 -好吧

00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,867
抱歉,我赢得太开心 听不到你说话
Sorry, I couIdn't hear you over aII the winning.

58
00:03:45,202 --> 00:03:48,771
-菲比在霸占游戏 -那是个愚蠢的游戏
-Phoebe's hogging the game. -It's a stupid game.

59
00:03:48,972 --> 00:03:51,909
你觉得它蠢 因为你很逊
You think it's stupid because you suck.

60
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,012
我不逊,它才逊
I don't suck. It sucks.

61
00:03:55,278 --> 00:03:57,514
你很逊
You suck.

62
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:03,821
如果这游戏会引起你们的困扰 我应该留下它
If this game is gonna cause probIems, I shouId keep it.

63
00:04:04,022 --> 00:04:06,891

No, I Iove it. It is a great present.

64
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:11,195
你为什么不回家等谢卡呢?
Why don't you go home and wait for the thank-you card?

65
00:04:11,462 --> 00:04:16,734
-你为什么要玩这个游戏? -它不会吐出糖果
-Why do you want to pIay this game? -It doesn't spit out a CIark Bar.

66
00:04:17,336 --> 00:04:20,639
好吧,菲比,够了 快下来
Okay. Phoebe, that's it. Out of the chair.

67
00:04:22,207 --> 00:04:24,443

68
00:04:24,609 --> 00:04:28,480

Wow, it's amazing how weII I can pIay with you yapping around my head...

73

And a brownie.

82
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,119
只有一半
WeII, haIf a brownie.

83
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:38,487
事实上它只剩袋子
ActuaIIy, it's just a bag.

84
00:05:38,688 --> 00:05:43,493
从花店走回来真的很远 我觉得头晕,所以…
It's a Iong waIk from the fIower shop and I feIt faint, so....

85
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,697
这真的是太棒了 我觉得好像真的在约会
This is so great! I actuaIIy feeI Iike I'm on a reaI date.

86
00:05:48,965 --> 00:05:54,170
但我会害喜 我穿的内裤裤头高到…
But I have morning sickness and I have on underwear that goes up to...

87
00:05:54,371 --> 00:05:55,839
这里
...there.

88
00:05:56,073 --> 00:05:58,875
少来了,这是真的约会
Hey, come on. This is a reaI date.

89
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,545
你家好漂亮
So nice pIace you got here.

90
00:06:02,413 --> 00:06:05,883
桌上足球,披萨盒
FoosbaII. Pizza box.

91
00:06:06,117 --> 00:06:10,055
还有花花公子杂志 你是我喜欢的那种女人
Oh, a subscription to Playboy. My kind of woman.

92
00:06:10,255 --> 00:06:12,223
那是我室友的杂志
That's my roommate's.

93
00:06:12,423 --> 00:06:16,227
我想见见他 他似乎是个好男人
I'd Iike to meet him. He sounds Iike a standup guy.

94
00:06:16,427 --> 00:06:20,598
他很保护我 你最好小心一点
He's protective of me, so you'd better watch yourseIf.

95
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:23,669
你室友很帅吗?
Your roommate, is he good-Iooking?

96
00:06:25,771 --> 00:06:28,974
你一定很努力控制自己 不爱上他
Must be tough to keep your hands off him.

97
00:06:29,475 --> 00:06:31,342
我相信他是男同志
I'm pretty sure he's gay.

98
00:06:32,278 --> 00:06:36,515
不是的 你为什么要毁了这个游戏?
No! No, he's not! Why are you trying to ruin the game?

99
00:06:38,285 --> 00:06:42,054
这让我想起葛瑞利的骨牌理论
Which brings us back to GreeIy's Theory of Dominance.

100
00:06:42,555 --> 00:06:44,223
今天到此为止
That's it for today.

101
00:06:44,691 --> 00:06:47,894
有人知道费利曼楼在哪里吗?
Does anyone know where the Freeman BuiIding is?

102
00:06:48,095 --> 00:06:50,397
那是A大道的新大楼
It's the new buiIding on Avenue A.

103
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:54,635
它在城里的另一边 我10分钟内得赶到那里上课
That's across town. I'm teaching there in 1 0 minutes.

104
00:06:54,868 --> 00:06:57,004
那是不可能的
Dude, that's not gonna happen.

105
00:07:00,274 --> 00:07:01,942
快闪开
Move it! Move it!

106
00:07:02,176 --> 00:07:04,645
我是老师
Hey! I'm the teacher!

107
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,928
哈
HeIIo.

108
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:28,270
抱歉我迟到了 我严重迟到
Sorry I'm a IittIe Iate. Whoa, a Iot Iate.

109
00:07:28,971 --> 00:07:32,274
我从自我介绍开始吧
WeII, Iet me start by introducing myseIf.

110
00:07:32,508 --> 00:07:34,877
我是盖勒教授

111
00:07:35,911 --> 00:07:38,347
总而言之…
So to sum up...

112
00:07:38,581 --> 00:07:42,552
我是盖勒教授 今天大家做得很好

113
00:07:45,288 --> 00:07:49,125
-菲力牛排搭配什么? -蒸蔬菜
-What comes with the fiIet mignon? -Steamed vegetabIes.

114
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,265
除了蔬菜…
Instead of the vegetabIes...

115
00:07:54,498 --> 00:07:58,769
我可以用什么东西搭配…
...is there any way that I couId substitute the...

116
00:07:59,003 --> 00:08:01,138
三磅的龙虾?

117
00:08:02,807 --> 00:08:04,909
知道吗?帮她把两道菜都送上来
You know what? Bring her both.

118
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:07,544
我要点跟她一样的东西
And I'II have the same.

119
00:08:07,845 --> 00:08:11,783
这真的是个很棒的约会
Wow, this is shaping up to be a pretty good date.

120
00:08:12,017 --> 00:08:15,053
我差点忘了 我没给你房租
I aImost forgot. I didn't pay you the rent.

121
00:08:15,253 --> 00:08:17,522
别当我们是室友,我们在约会
No roommate stuff. It's a date.

122
00:08:17,723 --> 00:08:22,327
我想知道乔伊崔比亚尼 怎么跟女人约会
Wow, so I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is Iike on a date.

123
00:08:22,561 --> 00:08:23,829
你有什么招数?
Have any moves?

124
00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:28,433
不,我只会做我自己 如果她们不喜欢我…
No, I'm just myseIf, and if they don't Iike me for--

125
00:08:30,904 --> 00:08:34,007
抱歉 我无法想像那种事
I'm sorry, I couIdn't even get through that.

126
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,443
我就知道,告诉我你有什么招数
I knew it. TeII me your moves.

127
00:08:37,644 --> 00:08:39,212
好吧

128
00:08:39,446 --> 00:08:40,680
嗯…
WeII....

129
00:08:40,947 --> 00:08:45,752
我会假装有影迷送一瓶红酒给我们
I start by having a bottIe of wine sent to my tabIe from a fan.

130
00:08:45,952 --> 00:08:49,422
天啊,有用吗?
Oh, my God. And that works?

131
00:08:49,623 --> 00:08:54,928
你得加上“这真是太不好意思了 我只想过正常人的生活”
If you add, ''This is embarrassing. I just want to have a normaI Iife.''

132
00:08:55,129 --> 00:08:57,631
你们这些可怜的名人
You poor IittIe famous man.

133
00:08:58,032 --> 00:09:00,467
好吧,这个呢?
Okay, how about this one?

134
00:09:01,369 --> 00:09:04,405
我本来想等到送你回家再吻你…
I was gonna wait untiI the end of the night to kiss you...

135
00:09:04,572 --> 00:09:08,208
但你真的太美了 我想我做不到
...but you're just so beautifuI, I don't think I can.

136
00:09:10,145 --> 00:09:11,579
天啊
Oh, my God!

137
00:09:13,615 --> 00:09:17,886
那真的太棒了 我差点就被你骗了
Wow, that was fantastic! I aImost Ieaned in. ReaIIy.

138
00:09:18,086 --> 00:09:20,255
告诉我你用的是什么招数
So teII me one of your moves.

139
00:09:20,456 --> 00:09:22,458
好吧
AII right.

140
00:09:25,327 --> 00:09:27,796
你是在哪里长大的?
So where'd you grow up?

141
00:09:28,564 --> 00:09:30,231
那就是你的招数?
That's your move?

142
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:33,302
瑞秋,还好你长得很美
Boy, Rach, you're Iucky you're hot.

143
00:09:33,503 --> 00:09:37,474
-快回答我的问题 -皇后区
-Come on, just answer the question. -Queens.

144
00:09:37,774 --> 00:09:40,076
你跟父母亲近吗?
Were you cIose to your parents?

145
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,513
-我跟妈妈亲,跟爸爸不太说话 -为什么?
-With my mom. Not so much my dad. -Why not?

146
00:09:43,781 --> 00:09:46,784
我不知道 我们之间有距离
I don't know. There's just this distance.

147
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:50,587
我们都假装没有 但事实上不然
We both try to pretend it's not there, but it is.

148
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,791
那一定很辛苦
It's gotta be rough.

149
00:09:54,024 --> 00:09:57,961
对,那真的很辛苦 有时候我认为…
Yeah, it's reaIIy tough. Sometimes I think....

150
00:09:58,162 --> 00:10:00,030
哇
Wow!

151
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,269
太帅了
Nice move!

152
00:10:05,503 --> 00:10:09,106
-“你在哪里长大的?”,太简单了 -谢谢
-''Where'd you grow up?'' So simpIe. -Thank you.

153
00:10:09,341 --> 00:10:12,344
对不起,我要去洗手间
Now, excuse me. I'm gonna use the restroom.

154
00:10:15,347 --> 00:10:19,518
-你正看着我走开 -没错,太简单了
-Now you're watching me waIk away. -Yes, I am! So simpIe!

155
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:28,627
-你一定不相信今天我做了什么 -很明显地你没洗澡或刮胡子
-You won't beIieve what I did today. -CIearIy not shower or shave.

156
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:32,197
我玩了这玩意一整天 现在我是第一名
I pIayed this aII day, and now I ruIe.

157
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,801
他们应该把它改名为 “钱德小姐”
They shouId change the name to ''Ms. ChandIer.''

158
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,872
还是不要好了
AIthough, I hope they don't.

159
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:45,411
你待在家里玩小精灵 我出门像牛一样在工作?
You stayed home and pIayed Ms. Pac-Man whiIe I went to work Iike a chump?

160
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:50,517
我包办了前10名 把菲比给挤掉了,庆祝一下吧
I got the top 1 0 scores. I erased Phoebe off the board. High-five!

161
00:10:51,953 --> 00:10:54,922
你的手是怎么了?
What is the matter with your hand?

162
00:10:57,792 --> 00:10:59,861
我打了八小时的电动
I pIayed for eight hours.

163
00:11:00,061 --> 00:11:02,964
它会放松的,看看我的记录
It'II Ioosen up. Check out the scores.

164
00:11:03,164 --> 00:11:06,567
看看我编的名字 它们全是脏话
AIso, Iook at the initiaIs. They're dirty words.

165
00:11:06,801 --> 00:11:10,972
-钱德,你为什么要那么做? -因为它很棒
-ChandIer, why wouId you do that? -Because it's awesome.

166
00:11:11,173 --> 00:11:12,774
你觉得那么做很聪明?
You think it's cIever?

167
00:11:12,975 --> 00:11:18,146
我只能写下三个字母 除了屁股外,其他的名字可是个大挑战
They onIy give you three Ietters, so after A-S-S, it is a chaIIenge.

168
00:11:18,614 --> 00:11:20,348
但你全都想出来了
But cIearIy you're up to the task.

169
00:11:21,817 --> 00:11:25,721
-这不是脏话 -把它跟那个连在一起
-This one's not dirty. -Put it together with that one.

170
00:11:25,921 --> 00:11:27,189
喔
Oh.

171
00:11:27,423 --> 00:11:32,361
如果你没办法把它清掉 我不会答应你的
If you don't cIear this off, you won't get one of those from me.

172
00:11:32,896 --> 00:11:35,664
班明天会过来 不能让他看到这个
Ben's coming over tomorrow. This can't be there.

173
00:11:35,865 --> 00:11:39,736
-他不知道它们的意思 -他七岁了,他不笨
-He won't know what they mean. -He's 7, not stupid.

174
00:11:39,936 --> 00:11:44,240
-最近你跟他谈过吗? -我要把＝插头拔掉
-Have you taIked to him IateIy? -I'm gonna unpIug it.

175
00:11:44,474 --> 00:11:48,177
我没办法证明我今天做了什么 就跟我的工作一样
I'II have nothing to show for my day. Like work.

176
00:11:48,846 --> 00:11:50,147
不
No!

177
00:11:51,181 --> 00:11:53,250
你看,画面还在
Hey, Iook! It's stiII there!

178
00:11:53,484 --> 00:11:57,254
这玩意一定是用 原始的记忆晶片
This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM chip!

179
00:11:57,722 --> 00:12:01,091
你会说脏话 又懂电脑
Wow. The dirty words and the computer taIk.

180
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:03,161
这是你做过最酷的事
This is just the cooIest you've ever been.

181
00:12:04,729 --> 00:12:07,765
-你得打败自己的成绩 -我的手指都张不开了
-You gotta beat your scores. -With the cIaw?

182
00:12:07,966 --> 00:12:11,402
好吧,让我来 我们得把这个消掉
Fine, I'II do it. We gotta get this off.

183
00:12:11,637 --> 00:12:15,574
卡萝还在气 你教他“拉我的手指”
CaroI's stiII upset that you taught him ''PuII my finger.''

184
00:12:15,841 --> 00:12:19,510
拉我的手指,我的手毁了
PuII my finger. My hand is messed up!

185
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:27,653
-我不会回答那个问题 -来吧,快挑一个
-I am not gonna answer that. -Oh, come on. Just pick one.

186
00:12:27,887 --> 00:12:31,423
在摩妮卡,菲比 钱德跟罗斯之间…
Between Monica, Phoebe, ChandIer and Ross...

187
00:12:31,658 --> 00:12:34,160
如果你非那么做不可 你会打谁?
...if you had to, who wouId you punch?

188
00:12:34,794 --> 00:12:38,030
我们是朋友,我不会打他们
We're friends. I wouIdn't punch any of them.

189
00:12:38,531 --> 00:12:40,199
钱德吗?
ChandIer?

190
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:43,202
对,但我不知道为什么
Yeah, but I don't know why.

191
00:12:44,437 --> 00:12:47,507
-我玩得很开心 -我也是
-I'm having a wonderfuI time! -Me too!

192
00:12:47,741 --> 00:12:51,579
-这是我最棒的约会经验 -我知道
-This is the best date I ever had. -I know!

193
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:55,448
我笑得好厉害 你看到酒从我鼻子喷出来吗?
I Iaughed so hard. Did you see the wine come out my nose?

194
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,318
乔伊,我想大家都看到了
Joey, I think everybody saw it.

195
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:04,092
我不知道我会这么喜欢 没有性爱的约会
I never knew I couId enjoy the non-sex part of a date so much.

196
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:09,197
那是因为 你没有跟我约会过
That's because you have never been on a date with me before.

197
00:13:10,565 --> 00:13:12,634
好吧,别批评我
AII right. Now don't judge me.

198
00:13:12,867 --> 00:13:17,505
通常我会等我的对象离开了再这么做 但我真的饿坏了
I normaIIy wait tiII my date Ieaves, but I'm ripping into the swan.

199
00:13:17,707 --> 00:13:20,409
好吧,你也别批评我
Okay, then you don't judge me.

200
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,146
我要去舔蛋糕的包装纸
I'm gonna suck on the ceIIophane from that brownie.

201
00:13:33,256 --> 00:13:35,024
对
Oh, yeah.

202
00:13:36,026 --> 00:13:39,963
告诉我乔伊崔比亚尼 说晚安的招数是什么
So teII me, what are Joey Tribbiani's end-of-the-night moves?

203
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:46,137
如果我要那个女孩吻我…
WeII, if I want the girI to kiss me...

204
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:49,773
首先我会让我的嘴巴 看起来难以抵抗
...first, I make my Iips Iook irresistibIe.

205
00:13:49,974 --> 00:13:51,242
你都是怎么做的?
How do you do it?

206
00:13:51,608 --> 00:13:55,345
你不能告诉任何人,但是…
Now you can't teII anyone, but...

207
00:13:55,613 --> 00:13:59,016
我会涂上护唇膏
...I put on shiny Iip baIm.

208
00:13:59,651 --> 00:14:04,789
-天啊 -女人就跟飞蛾扑火一样
-Oh, my God. -Like a moth to a fIame, I teII you.

209
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:08,726
-好吧,轮到你了 -不,我不想告诉你
-Okay, now you go. -No, I don't want to teII you.

210
00:14:08,961 --> 00:14:10,795
-为什么? -那太丢脸了
-Why not? -It's embarrassing.

211
00:14:11,196 --> 00:14:14,799
比涂覆盆子口味的护唇膏 还丢脸?
More embarrassing than shiny raspberry Iip baIm?

212
00:14:15,768 --> 00:14:18,570
我刚刚没说覆盆子口味吧?
I didn't say raspberry before, did I?

213
00:14:19,071 --> 00:14:22,274
快告诉我,瑞秋
Just teII me, Rach. Just teII me.

214
00:14:22,575 --> 00:14:23,642
好吧
Okay.

215
00:14:23,876 --> 00:14:25,878
站起来
AII right, stand up.

216
00:14:28,281 --> 00:14:30,616
我们走到门边时…
WeII, when we're at the door...

217
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:35,689
我会将我的嘴唇 轻轻压在他的嘴唇上
...I IightIy press my Iips against his.

218
00:14:35,889 --> 00:14:40,126
将身体靠向他 一秒钟
Then move into his body, just for a second.

219
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,862
然后我会发出这样的声音
And then I make this sound:

220
00:14:48,535 --> 00:14:51,538
听起来没什么 但很有效
It doesn't sound Iike anything, but it works.

221
00:14:51,806 --> 00:14:55,042
对,那的确有效
Oh, yeah. That wouId work, yeah.

222
00:14:56,177 --> 00:15:00,715
好吧,我得睡了 我玩得很开心
AII right, I gotta go to bed. I had such a wonderfuI time.

223
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,824
我也是
Me too.

224
00:15:20,369 --> 00:15:23,705
你迟到了50分钟? 你是用爬的吗?
You were 50 minutes Iate? Did you crawI?

225
00:15:24,106 --> 00:15:26,742
不,我用跑的,那真的很远
No, I ran, okay? It's reaIIy far.

226
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:31,213
人们什么时候开始听不懂 “别挡我的路”?
When did peopIe stop understanding ''Get out of my way''?

227
00:15:31,881 --> 00:15:33,783
你为什么不搭计程车?
Why didn't you take a cab?

228
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:38,888
塞车太严重,那是单行道 搭计程车得花两倍的时间
With the traffic and one-way streets, it'd take me twice as Iong.

229
00:15:39,156 --> 00:15:43,894
我一星期有三堂课 我是洛克菲勒吗?
And I have cIass three times a week. Who am I, RockefeIIer?

230
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:47,097
你没办法再继续下去
You won't be abIe to keep doing this.

231
00:15:47,331 --> 00:15:51,034
我不那么做 他们会取消我这堂课
If I don't, they'II take the cIass away from me.

232
00:15:51,302 --> 00:15:54,272
我把它登在我家的通讯报上
And I put it in my famiIy newsIetter.

233
00:15:55,273 --> 00:15:58,876
-什么? -你看过的,盖勒通讯报
-Your what? -You've seen it, The Geller Yeller.

234
00:16:00,311 --> 00:16:03,381
对
Right. Wow.

235
00:16:03,582 --> 00:16:08,720
我想出一条比较快的路线 我想这次我能及时赶到
I figured out a faster route. I'm sure I can make it this time.

236
00:16:08,987 --> 00:16:14,125
我不能害怕 被车子撞到
I just can't be afraid to get a IittIe bit hit by cars.

237
00:16:15,594 --> 00:16:18,029
-嘿 -嗨
-Hey. -Hi!

238
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:21,300
还记得我们谈过《狂犬惊魂记》吗?
Remember when we taIked about Cujo?

239
00:16:21,534 --> 00:16:24,804
我不敢相信你没看过《狂犬惊魂记》
I can't beIieve you haven't seen Cujo.

240
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,039
别紧张,它不是《大国民》
ReIax, it isn't Citizen Kane.

241
00:16:27,273 --> 00:16:30,443
你看完了《大国民》?
Have you ever sat through Citizen Kane?

242
00:16:30,676 --> 00:16:34,747
对,它真的很无聊 但它是名片
Yeah, it's reaIIy boring. But it's, Iike, a big deaI.

243
00:16:35,181 --> 00:16:38,318
总之,我想去租《狂犬惊魂记》
Anyway, I was thinking about renting Cujo.

244
00:16:38,552 --> 00:16:40,921
我们今晚一起看吧
WeII, Iet's do it tonight.

245
00:16:41,121 --> 00:16:44,724
-你不是有约会吗? -对
-Don't you have that big date? -Oh, right.

246
00:16:44,925 --> 00:16:48,328
-乔伊,我能问你一件事吗? -问吧
-Hey, Joey, can I ask you something? -Yeah.

247
00:16:48,595 --> 00:16:51,431
昨晚约会后你觉不觉得怪怪的?
After our date, did you feeI weird?

248
00:16:51,632 --> 00:16:56,336
天啊,你也是吗? 我吓坏了,那是什么?
Oh, my God. You did too? It freaked me out. What was that?

249
00:16:56,604 --> 00:17:02,076
我不知道 我想应该是龙虾的问题
I don't know. I'm kind of thinking it was the Iobster.

250
00:17:05,113 --> 00:17:08,150
对,龙虾
Oh, yeah. Yeah, the Iobster.

251
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:11,719
-我吐了一整晚 -我也是
-I was up sick aII night. -Me too. AII night.

252
00:17:11,954 --> 00:17:14,622
真的吗?我没看到你
ReaIIy? We didn't cross paths.

253
00:17:14,823 --> 00:17:17,760
对,那是因为…
Yeah, weII, that's because...

254
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,462
我都待在房里
...I stayed in my room.

255
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:24,099
你不会想看我的洗衣篮的
You don't want to Iook in my hamper.

256
00:17:28,872 --> 00:17:30,339
我懂了
Okay, I got that.

257
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,610
我要逃离那里 回到这里
I'II escape there. I'II come back here.

258
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,545
来吧,小精灵
AII right. Come on, Ms. Pac-Man.

259
00:17:38,382 --> 00:17:41,885
你是个混蛋,对吧?
WeII, you're just a IittIe bitch, aren't you?!

260
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,056
大家好
Hey, you guys?

261
00:17:46,323 --> 00:17:49,726
抱歉之前 我霸占着电动玩具
I'm sorry that I was hogging the game before.

262
00:17:49,927 --> 00:17:53,097
如果你不快下来,我会杀了你
But if you don't get off soon, I wiII cut you.

263
00:17:55,300 --> 00:18:01,339
天啊,你朋友名字的缩写真难听
Oh, my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initiaIs.

264
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,007
那都是钱德干的
They're aII ChandIer.

265
00:18:03,274 --> 00:18:05,543
钱德不可能有这么厉害
ChandIer couIdn't get this good.

266
00:18:05,811 --> 00:18:10,649
我很厉害,但那是要付出代价的
I did. But it came at a price.

267
00:18:11,317 --> 00:18:13,985
班要过来,他不能看到这个
Ben's coming, and he can't see this.

268
00:18:14,186 --> 00:18:17,656
七岁的孩子应该都看过杂交
By age 7, kids have aIready seen orgies.

269
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,295
还是只有我而已?
Was it just me?

270
00:18:26,966 --> 00:18:28,367
总之…
So...

271
00:18:28,535 --> 00:18:30,069
我们没时间了
...we're about out of time.

272
00:18:30,237 --> 00:18:34,707
我知道我提供你们很多新资讯
Now, I know I've given you a Iot of new information.

273
00:18:36,409 --> 00:18:38,611
那或许很吓人
And it may seem a IittIe overwheIming.

274
00:18:41,649 --> 00:18:43,684
但今天…
But, if there's one thing...

275
00:18:43,884 --> 00:18:46,153
在课堂上 你们得学会一件事…
...you need to take away from cIass today...

276
00:18:48,756 --> 00:18:49,990
那就是…
...it's that...

277
00:18:50,158 --> 00:18:53,561
恐龙永远都不会复活
...dinosaurs ain't never coming back.

278
00:18:54,128 --> 00:18:56,564
下次再见
I'II see you next time.

279
00:19:09,711 --> 00:19:13,347
我办到了,我及时赶到
Yes, I made it! I'm on time!

280
00:19:17,987 --> 00:19:21,090
好了,请大家…
Okay, why don't we aII...

281
00:19:23,092 --> 00:19:25,894
翻到第23页…
...open our books to page 23...

282
00:19:26,129 --> 00:19:27,530
你们…
...where...

283
00:19:28,965 --> 00:19:31,902
你们将会看到…
...where you wiII see...

284
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:37,874
很多红点
...a bunch of red spots.

285
00:19:39,343 --> 00:19:44,315
请大家先看一下 我要…
Okay, why don't you aII start to read whiIe I....

286
00:19:51,255 --> 00:19:53,123
这真的是太不好意思了
This is so embarrassing.

287
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:56,327
我只想过正常人的生活
I just want to have a normaI Iife.

288
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:59,430
那瓶红酒很贵的
Wow, that's an expensive bottIe of wine.

289
00:19:59,597 --> 00:20:01,499
是吗?
It is?

290
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:04,001
真有趣 通常我的影迷不会那么做
That's funny, my fans don't normaIIy do that.

291
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:15,981
你没事吗? 你似乎有点心不在焉
Are you aII right? You seem a IittIe distracted.

292
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,652
不,我没事,我只是…
No, no, I'm fine. It's just....

293
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:22,955
我能问你一件事吗?
Hey, can I ask you something?

294
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:26,059
你有没有这样的经验 看着你认识的人…
Have you ever Iooked at someone you know...

295
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:29,862
突然间有不一样的感觉?
...and suddenIy seen them in a different way?

296
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,098
你是说从背后看吗?
You mean Iike from behind?

297
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:40,006
没错,就是那样
Yeah. That's exactIy it.

298
00:20:40,207 --> 00:20:44,511
我从背后看这个家伙 觉得他真的很普通
I saw this guy from behind, and he seemed totaIIy normaI.

299
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:48,482
他一转身 我才知道他是史蒂芬鲍德温
And then he turned around and it was Stephen BaIdwin!

300
00:20:49,617 --> 00:20:50,918
对
Yeah.

301
00:20:51,252 --> 00:20:53,621
你完全了解我的意思
So you know exactIy what I mean.

302
00:20:53,854 --> 00:20:57,124
没错
TotaIIy! Wow.

306
00:21:17,513 --> 00:21:19,515
-别碰我 -别碰她
-Don't touch me! -Don't touch her!

307
00:21:19,716 --> 00:21:22,018
左边,右边,右边
Go Ieft! Go right! Go right!

308
00:21:22,218 --> 00:21:23,885
我办不到
I can't! I can't!

309
00:21:24,153 --> 00:21:27,289
不,你这个天杀的…

310
00:21:40,404 --> 00:21:42,105

00:21:42,606 --> 00:21:46,376
嗨,班 不,别看机器
Oh, hi, Ben. No, don't Iook at the machine!

312
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:59,290
谢天谢地你回来了 我在看《狂犬惊魂记》
Thank God you're home! I'm watching Cujo.

313
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:04,128
-你一个人? -对,这只狗是怎么了?
-AIone? -Yes! What is wrong with this dog?

314
00:22:04,463 --> 00:22:08,500
你看到库裘 自己去撞车的那一幕了吗?
Did you get to the part where Cujo throws himseIf at the car?

315
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,637
不,真的 这只狗是怎么了?
No, seriousIy, what's wrong with the dog?

316
00:22:12,972 --> 00:22:15,307
等一下,你不是去约会了吗?
Wait, what happened to your date?

317
00:22:15,741 --> 00:22:17,910
我们之间不来电
Oh, it didn't work out.

318
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:22,814
-你要跟我一起把电影看完吗? -好吧
-Want to watch the rest of the movie? -Oh, okay. Yeah.

319
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:25,418
我没有想过我会这么说…
I never thought I'd say this...

320
00:22:25,651 --> 00:22:27,920
但我希望这只狗死掉
...but I hope this dog dies.

321
00:22:30,123 --> 00:22:33,093
你在做什么? 坐在这里保护我
What are you doing? Sit here. Protect me.

322
00:22:33,326 --> 00:22:36,529
没问题,有何不可呢?
Oh. Sure, yeah. Why not?

323
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:42,102

00:22:54,616 --> 00:22:59,887

Oh, my God. What's he gonna do now? I can't watch.

327
00:23:02,324 --> 00:23:05,227
你怎么能看这个? 你不害怕吗?
How can you watch this? Aren't you scared?

328
00:23:09,064 --> 00:23:11,099
我怕极了
Terrified.

329
00:23:21,144 --> 00:23:25,982
