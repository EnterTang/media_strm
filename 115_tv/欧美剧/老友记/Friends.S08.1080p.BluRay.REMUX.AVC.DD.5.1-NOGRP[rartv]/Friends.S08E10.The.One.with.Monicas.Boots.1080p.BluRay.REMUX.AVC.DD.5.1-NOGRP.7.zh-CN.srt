1
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,069
-Hey.
-Hey. So, what do you think?

2
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,638
New haircut? NeckIace? Dress?

3
00:00:11,838 --> 00:00:14,239
Boots? Boots!

4
00:00:15,608 --> 00:00:20,311
Now, they're a IittIe more than I usuaIIy
spend on boots. Or rent.

5
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:24,747
Did you say you bought ''boots''
or ''boats''?

6
00:00:25,548 --> 00:00:26,882
I know.

7
00:00:27,049 --> 00:00:32,552
-I'II miss being abIe to afford food.
-I'm sorry. They just Iooked so good.

8
00:00:32,753 --> 00:00:34,454
The saIeswoman was Iike:

9
00:00:34,722 --> 00:00:38,491
-''These are too expensive for you.''
-She had a point.

10
00:00:39,192 --> 00:00:42,227
-Hey.
-Hi. Oh, my God.

11
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:47,997
-Oh, Monica, those boots are amazing.
-They're mine!

12
00:00:48,598 --> 00:00:54,535
-Too bad we're gonna have to return them.
-Return them? They're gonna hear you.

13
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:58,838
I'm not returning them. I know they
cost a Iot, but I'II wear them aII the time.

14
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,141
You'II see. Besides,
I Iove the compIiments.

15
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:06,177
Have you ever had something
so beautifuI, everyone wants it?

16
00:01:06,411 --> 00:01:11,214
-I have you.
-Nice try. I'm keeping the boots.

17
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:16,451
美天乐工作室
http://friends6.go.3322.org

18
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:51,810
That's right. I Iove you.

19
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:56,146
And I'm gonna pIay with you
aII the time.

20
00:01:56,347 --> 00:02:00,315
How can you Iet him taIk
to your crotch Iike that?

21
00:02:02,484 --> 00:02:06,586
-He's taIking to the baby.
-Oh! Okay.

22
00:02:08,188 --> 00:02:11,790
Okay, because when he said,
''I can't wait for your first words'' ...

23
00:02:12,024 --> 00:02:14,292
...I thought, ''There's a trick.''

24
00:02:16,127 --> 00:02:19,296
WeII, I gotta go, you guys.
I'II see you Iater.

25
00:02:19,529 --> 00:02:21,597
-Okay. Bye.
-Bye.

26
00:02:22,866 --> 00:02:28,202
Hey, Iisten. Can you do me a favor? My
sister knows you work at RaIph Lauren--

27
00:02:28,403 --> 00:02:31,838
Forget it. No way. I am not sending
more RaIph Lauren cIothes to prison.

28
00:02:32,038 --> 00:02:34,206
-It is a waste.
-No, not her.

29
00:02:34,407 --> 00:02:38,009
My youngest sister, Dina,
is interested in fashion.

30
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,512
She wants to taIk to someone successfuI
to give her some advice.

31
00:02:41,712 --> 00:02:45,614
-I guess I couId taIk to my supervisors.
-No, she wants to taIk to you.

32
00:02:45,815 --> 00:02:50,818
ReaIIy? Oh, my God. I'm successfuI.

33
00:02:51,052 --> 00:02:54,488
-Okay, so wouId you meet with her?
-Yes, I'd Iove to. Have her come by.

34
00:02:54,722 --> 00:02:59,692
Great, thanks. You'II Iove her. She's the
smartest of aII the Tribbiani chiIdren.

35
00:02:59,892 --> 00:03:01,393
-Yeah, you know the SATs?
-Yeah.

36
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:03,194
She took them.

37
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:08,999
-Doesn't Ben go to SmithfieId Day SchooI?
-Yeah. Why?

38
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,501
-Sting has a son that goes there too.
-I know. He's in Ben's cIass.

39
00:03:13,268 --> 00:03:19,039
You knew and never said anything? With
aII the stupid dinosaur stuff you teII us?

40
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:24,943
Fine, no more dinosaur stuff.
Can I taIk about fossiIs?

41
00:03:30,047 --> 00:03:32,949
''Sting's son, 7 years oId.''
And there's a picture.

42
00:03:33,182 --> 00:03:38,085
What are you reading, ''The Kidnapper's
Guide to Manhattan Private SchooIs''?

43
00:03:38,286 --> 00:03:41,688
It's New York Magazine. It's an articIe
about the city's best schooIs.

44
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:45,957
-So how weII do you know Sting?
-I actuaIIy haven't even met him.

45
00:03:46,191 --> 00:03:51,061
Yeah. That's too bad. I reaIIy wanna go to
his concert Friday, but it's soId out.

46
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:55,297
I know! Why don't you
meet him and get tickets.

47
00:03:55,565 --> 00:03:58,066
If you get two, I'II take you.

48
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,768
I'm picking Ben up tomorrow.
Maybe he'II be there.

49
00:04:01,002 --> 00:04:05,739
There you go. You're so Iucky.
You might get to meet Sting tomorrow.

50
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:08,473
That's why you have kids.

51
00:04:15,179 --> 00:04:16,613
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

52
00:04:16,813 --> 00:04:20,282
Hi, Monica. Hi, boots.

53
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:25,618
See, ChandIer? I'm getting a Iot of use out
of them aIready. They're very practicaI.

54
00:04:25,887 --> 00:04:28,722
You can wear them
with dresses, skirts, pants....

55
00:04:28,956 --> 00:04:33,592
You wear them with shorts on the corner
and earn the money to pay for them.

56
00:04:34,593 --> 00:04:38,762
-Wow, they're beautifuI.
-They hurt so much.

57
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,164
-What?
-The guy who made these...

58
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:44,467
...hates feet
and wants to see them die.

59
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:48,835
Give them to me.
I haven't feIt my feet in years.

60
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:53,639
I can't. I toId ChandIer I'd wear them
aII the time. I can't just give them away.

61
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,142
-Then get your money back and return them.
-I can't do that either.

62
00:04:57,342 --> 00:05:02,479
The soIes are scuffed up, and the
insides are fiIIed with my bIood.

63
00:05:04,481 --> 00:05:08,616
-Hey.
-Hey, I just picked up Ben from schooI.

64
00:05:08,884 --> 00:05:12,319
I don't think you did
a very thorough job.

65
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,754
I dropped him off at CaroI's.

66
00:05:14,955 --> 00:05:17,757
Anyway, it turns out I'm not gonna
get those tickets, though.

67
00:05:17,991 --> 00:05:19,257
Oh, no. Why not?

68
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:23,294
It turns out Ben and Sting's son
do not get aIong.

69
00:05:23,495 --> 00:05:26,497
-How come?
-ApparentIy, Sting's son made fun...

70
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:30,032
...of the fact that Ben's moms
are ''Iesbenims.''

71
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:35,803
Wait. If they don't get aIong, smooth
things over. Make them be friends.

72
00:05:36,004 --> 00:05:39,072
-You can't force kids to be friends.
-Sure you can.

73
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,973
Give them some bIocks.
Put them in a pIaypen.

74
00:05:42,674 --> 00:05:45,743
-PIaypen? Ben's 7.
-Your kid is 7?

75
00:05:47,778 --> 00:05:49,813
He's reaIIy smaII.

76
00:05:51,348 --> 00:05:55,250
-PIease get the tickets.
-I'm sorry. I just can't do it.

77
00:05:55,451 --> 00:05:59,253
-Yes, you can. Sting says so himseIf.
-What?

78
00:06:04,657 --> 00:06:06,024
Look, I'm sorry--

79
00:06:11,262 --> 00:06:12,896
Phoebe?

80
00:06:23,904 --> 00:06:26,806
Here she is: future fashion superstar.

81
00:06:27,006 --> 00:06:30,975
-Oh, Joey, I'm hardIy--
-My IittIe sister Dina.

82
00:06:31,176 --> 00:06:33,277
-Hi, Dina. Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

83
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:36,780
Thanks so much for meeting with me.
Joey's toId me so much about you.

84
00:06:36,947 --> 00:06:38,247
This is so exciting for her.

85
00:06:38,414 --> 00:06:41,716
-RaIph Lauren smiIed at her in the eIevator.
-You sure it was at you?

86
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:45,319
Because he Iikes it sometimes
when the buttons Iight up.

87
00:06:45,486 --> 00:06:50,989
WeII, I'II Iet you two ''fashists''
get down to business.

88
00:06:51,424 --> 00:06:56,127
You, be good, Iearn a Iot. And if she takes
you to the freebie room, I need shirts...

89
00:06:56,294 --> 00:07:01,230
...but none with that creepy Iogo with
the guy riding the dog, hoIding the bone.

90
00:07:01,698 --> 00:07:03,866
Okay. AII right, Dina.

91
00:07:04,067 --> 00:07:07,902
WeII, Iet's taIk about the different
areas of fashion...

92
00:07:08,102 --> 00:07:10,236
...that you couId get invoIved in.

93
00:07:10,437 --> 00:07:14,807
Let's see, there's design. But you may
need a whoIe other degree for that.

94
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,009
-SaIes is great. You get to traveI.
-I don't care about fashion.

95
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:23,746
I'm pregnant. And I know you are too,
so you gotta heIp me.

96
00:07:25,348 --> 00:07:27,716
Then there's marketing.

97
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:54,602
-What's wrong?
-Nothing. I just was yawning.

98
00:07:55,736 --> 00:07:59,538
-Don't forget, my office party's tonight.
-That's tonight?

99
00:07:59,706 --> 00:08:03,975
I forgot aII about the ''secret Santa'' gift.

100
00:08:04,676 --> 00:08:06,477
Do we Iike this?

101
00:08:07,045 --> 00:08:09,213
We don't reaIIy have to go to this thing,
do we?

102
00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:15,450
I know that you don't Iike my office parties,
but you can wear your new boots.

103
00:08:15,651 --> 00:08:19,320
See? Every cIoud has
a suppIe Ieather Iining.

104
00:08:20,687 --> 00:08:24,189
-I don't wanna wear the boots tonight.
-Why not?

105
00:08:24,424 --> 00:08:28,727
I'm worried your bosses wiII see them
and think they pay you too much money.

106
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:32,529
Or your assistant wiII see them
and want a raise.

107
00:08:33,196 --> 00:08:36,732
Do you think I work some kind of
boot-pricing company?

108
00:08:36,966 --> 00:08:40,535
I picked out this outfit I wanna wear,
and the boots don't go with it.

109
00:08:40,736 --> 00:08:45,705
You said those boots go with skirts,
dresses and pants.

110
00:08:45,872 --> 00:08:49,307
What are you pIanning on wearing,
a chicken suit?

111
00:08:50,075 --> 00:08:52,676
Fine. If you want me to,
I'II wear the boots.

112
00:08:52,877 --> 00:08:57,280
In fact, I'II go into my room right now
and try the outfit on.

113
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:04,785
Christmas party in my boots!

114
00:09:09,822 --> 00:09:12,824
I can't go in there. I can't teII him.

115
00:09:12,992 --> 00:09:17,328
It's gonna be okay.
He has been incredibIy supportive of me.

116
00:09:17,528 --> 00:09:21,831
And if he gets a IittIe upset,
that's what the meatbaII sub is for.

117
00:09:22,498 --> 00:09:24,266
-Thank you.
-Okay.

118
00:09:25,534 --> 00:09:29,103
Hey! It's my fashion girIs.

119
00:09:31,472 --> 00:09:33,873
-What's wrong?
-Why don't you sit down.

120
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,842
Dina has something
that she wants to teII you.

121
00:09:38,043 --> 00:09:42,446
What's going on?
Is it Mom? Is she sick?

122
00:09:42,646 --> 00:09:44,514
Is it Dad's heart?

123
00:09:44,714 --> 00:09:47,148
Is that a sandwich?

124
00:09:49,218 --> 00:09:52,787
-Mom and Dad are fine.
-Is that a sandwich?!

125
00:09:54,288 --> 00:10:00,058
Joey, there's something
that you shouId know. Dina?

126
00:10:01,293 --> 00:10:04,728
-I'm pregnant.
-What?

127
00:10:04,962 --> 00:10:07,163
Now. Give him the sandwich!

128
00:10:08,664 --> 00:10:11,900
ObviousIy, this is a mistake.
You can't be pregnant.

129
00:10:12,067 --> 00:10:15,203
Because you have to have sex
to get pregnant.

130
00:10:15,403 --> 00:10:18,705
Joe, I tried to wait untiI
I was 25, Iike you did.

131
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,808
What? Dina--

132
00:10:25,343 --> 00:10:31,314
I can't beIieve this. You're the good one.
You went to coIIege! Both years!

133
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,383
Who did this to you?

134
00:10:35,618 --> 00:10:39,987
Bobby Corso. But he's a reaI nice guy.
I Iike him a Iot. He's reaI funny.

135
00:10:40,154 --> 00:10:46,658
You got pregnant for ''funny''?
Dina, if he's funny, Iaugh!

136
00:10:49,728 --> 00:10:52,696
-I'II be back. Stay here!
-Why? Where you going?

137
00:10:52,896 --> 00:10:56,265
I can't Iook at you right now.

138
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:01,702
I know.

139
00:11:14,611 --> 00:11:17,012
Oh, there you are, Ben.

140
00:11:17,881 --> 00:11:19,982
You're Ben, right?

141
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,684
Aunt Phoebe, what are you doing here?

142
00:11:22,851 --> 00:11:25,385
I heard you're having a probIem
with one of the boys.

143
00:11:25,553 --> 00:11:31,089
So I thought I'd come and sit you both down,
have a IittIe taIk and make it aII okay.

144
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:35,392
Now, the boy's name is Sting's son.

145
00:11:36,027 --> 00:11:38,829
Jack? I hate him. He's a jerk.

146
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:43,098
Sometimes peopIe may seem
Iike jerks on the outside...

147
00:11:43,366 --> 00:11:45,933
...but they have famous fathers.

148
00:11:46,468 --> 00:11:49,536
I have to go. My friend Doug
is waiting for me over there.

149
00:11:49,737 --> 00:11:52,338
Wow, your friend Doug
Iooks a Iot Iike BiIIy JoeI.

150
00:11:52,506 --> 00:11:56,776
-Is that who his father is?
-No. His dad's a dentist.

151
00:11:56,942 --> 00:11:58,477
Him, you're friends with.

152
00:12:04,547 --> 00:12:10,685
-Excuse me, can I heIp you with something?
-Yes. I'm Iooking for Jack's parents.

153
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:13,653
-Are you with one of the students?
-I'm with Ben.

154
00:12:13,954 --> 00:12:19,057
-Are you one of Ben's mothers?
-I am one of Ben's mothers.

155
00:12:19,292 --> 00:12:21,626
I'm a Iesbian.

156
00:12:21,859 --> 00:12:25,661
It was difficuIt coming out
to my parents.

157
00:12:25,862 --> 00:12:29,831
WeII, hi. I'm Jenny Boon.
I'm a new teacher here.

158
00:12:30,065 --> 00:12:34,868
-I've onIy met your partner, CaroI.
-That wouId make me Susan.

159
00:12:35,103 --> 00:12:41,073
Right. Are you Iooking for Jack's parents
to discuss his probIems with Ben?

160
00:12:41,273 --> 00:12:44,975
I think the parents shouId sit down together
and have a conversation.

161
00:12:45,176 --> 00:12:48,078
Yeah, Iet's do that!

162
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:50,246
That sounds good.

163
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,150
We shouId sit down and taIk.
Me, my Iover, CaroI, and the Stings.

164
00:12:55,350 --> 00:13:00,686
-How wiII I get in touch with them?
-Their number's on the contact sheet.

165
00:13:00,887 --> 00:13:05,790
CouId I get a copy of that?
CaroI threw it out. She Iost ours.

166
00:13:05,991 --> 00:13:11,128
She's such a scatterbrain.
But, man, what a hot piece of ass.

167
00:13:17,099 --> 00:13:21,502
-You know, that party wasn't bad.
-Yeah. I didn't know there'd be dancing.

168
00:13:21,736 --> 00:13:23,737
That was a fun surprise.

169
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:27,840
-I don't see a cab. Maybe we shouId waIk.
-No, we can't waIk.

170
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:30,909
No. Hey, there's a cab.

171
00:13:31,309 --> 00:13:33,110
That's a poIice car.

172
00:13:33,277 --> 00:13:36,146
Maybe we couId commit a crime,
have them pick us up.

173
00:13:36,613 --> 00:13:39,582
-It's 1 5 bIocks to the subway. Come on.
-Okay.

174
00:13:39,782 --> 00:13:45,018
Do you think we can get to the subway
if we cIimb through that manhoIe?

175
00:13:45,253 --> 00:13:48,388
-What's going on?
-I can't waIk, okay?

176
00:13:48,555 --> 00:13:51,590
-These boots were a huge mistake.
-What?

177
00:13:51,824 --> 00:13:56,894
You were right. I never shouId have bought
them. They're kiIIing me, one toe at a time.

178
00:13:57,362 --> 00:14:01,197
-So they're reaIIy tight, huh?
-I just said you were right, sweetie.

179
00:14:01,365 --> 00:14:03,999
Isn't it cIear I'm deIirious from the pain?

180
00:14:04,167 --> 00:14:08,302
So I was right. This is what
it feeIs Iike to be right.

181
00:14:09,436 --> 00:14:12,238
It's oddIy unsettIing.

182
00:14:12,438 --> 00:14:15,006
How are we gonna we get home?
Maybe a piggyback ride?

183
00:14:15,174 --> 00:14:18,242
I don't think me getting on your back
is gonna improve matters.

184
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:22,079
Wow, being right sure doesn't heIp
with the funny.

185
00:14:22,245 --> 00:14:23,880
-Hop on.
-Okay, wait.

186
00:14:24,081 --> 00:14:27,049
Let me just get my boots off first.

187
00:14:32,587 --> 00:14:34,554
Oh, God.

188
00:14:39,057 --> 00:14:43,727
I know you're in pain right now,
but I'm a IittIe turned-on.

189
00:14:47,864 --> 00:14:52,834
Do you ever worry that you'II be waIking
and your baby wiII just sIip out?

190
00:14:54,903 --> 00:14:58,071
What coIIege was that, Dina?

191
00:14:59,539 --> 00:15:01,740
Oh, my God. Bobby?

192
00:15:01,974 --> 00:15:05,810
Hi, Dina. Good to see you.

193
00:15:06,044 --> 00:15:10,179
-Joey, what are you doing?
-Just what needs to be done.

194
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:15,117
-DearIy beIoved, we're gathered here--
-This is crazy.

195
00:15:15,317 --> 00:15:18,552
Don't interrupt me
when I'm taIking to God!

196
00:15:18,753 --> 00:15:22,355
-Where were we? Do you take this man--?
-No!

197
00:15:22,556 --> 00:15:24,557
-You'II take him.
-No, I won't!

198
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,658
-You don't get a say.
-Yes, I do.

199
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:32,229
-I heard ''I do.'' We're haIfway there. You.
-AII right, Joey, that is enough!

200
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:35,898
As beautifuI and moving
as this ceremony is, this is not IegaI.

201
00:15:36,098 --> 00:15:42,502
They don't have a marriage Iicense or
witnesses, and the groom onIy has one shoe.

202
00:15:42,737 --> 00:15:46,772
Yeah, he took the other one off
and hit me with it.

203
00:15:46,973 --> 00:15:48,240
What am I supposed to do?

204
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:52,409
You're supposed to reaIize they are aduIts
and that can make their own decisions.

205
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:57,047
No, they can't. They were
stupid enough to get knocked up!

206
00:15:58,448 --> 00:16:01,983
Contraceptives are not
aIways effective. Right?

207
00:16:02,551 --> 00:16:08,955
-Yeah. We kind of didn't use any.
-Come on, kids, a IittIe heIp here!

208
00:16:13,225 --> 00:16:16,694
Wow! This pIace is incredibIe!

209
00:16:18,929 --> 00:16:21,264
Sting's pen...

210
00:16:21,465 --> 00:16:24,567
...that he gave to Phoebe.

211
00:16:28,903 --> 00:16:32,905
Come on, secret passageway.

212
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,841
-Hi.
-Hi.

213
00:16:37,109 --> 00:16:39,944
I'm Trudie. You must be Ben's mum.

214
00:16:40,144 --> 00:16:44,447
-Why eIse wouId I be here?
-Why don't you sit down.

215
00:16:44,681 --> 00:16:48,183
I gather Jack and Ben
haven't been getting aIong IateIy.

216
00:16:48,384 --> 00:16:50,485
I'm sure there are two sides to this story.

217
00:16:50,685 --> 00:16:54,353
But aII I've heard is that
Ben's a bit of a ''poo-poo-head.''

218
00:16:54,554 --> 00:16:58,857
-I'm sorry, won't Jack's father be joining us?
-No.

219
00:16:59,892 --> 00:17:03,794
I see. You see, I think it wouId be better
for the chiIdren...

220
00:17:03,961 --> 00:17:09,699
...if aII the parents were here. Except for,
you know, Ben's birth mother and father.

221
00:17:09,865 --> 00:17:13,334
WeII, I'm sorry.
Jack's father's not avaiIabIe.

222
00:17:14,002 --> 00:17:18,571
Okay. WeII, then, couId we rescheduIe
for Friday night, perhaps at 8:00?

223
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:21,373
No, I know that wouIdn't work.
My husband's in concert.

224
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:27,478
Concert. Yeah.
That does put us in quite a pickIe.

225
00:17:27,712 --> 00:17:32,481
I'm busy before and after the concert,
and he's obviousIy busy during.

226
00:17:32,715 --> 00:17:36,717
So I guess you and I shouId taIk
about Jack and Ben right now.

227
00:17:36,918 --> 00:17:39,419
UnIess-- UnIess....

228
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,588
Okay, I wouId be wiIIing
to go to the concert...

229
00:17:43,789 --> 00:17:46,891
...aII the whiIe thinking
about the chiIdren.

230
00:17:47,126 --> 00:17:51,695
-Are you here for tickets?
-Thank you. Four wouId be great.

231
00:17:51,929 --> 00:17:57,265
I'm not giving concert tickets to someone
who'd use their son Iike this.

232
00:17:57,466 --> 00:18:00,768
Then you're in Iuck. Ben's not my son.

233
00:18:00,969 --> 00:18:04,004
Look, I've just pressed a button
triggering a siIent aIarm.

234
00:18:04,238 --> 00:18:08,641
-Any minute now, the poIice wiII be here.
-The PoIice? Here?

235
00:18:08,841 --> 00:18:11,008
A reunion?

236
00:18:17,981 --> 00:18:22,317
Okay, 1 0 bIocks down. Five to go.

237
00:18:22,617 --> 00:18:27,720
-Oh, wait! Stop, stop!
-Oh, I'm sorry. Do you need a break?

238
00:18:28,688 --> 00:18:31,823
My boots in tan! Can you get a IittIe cIoser
so I see the price?

239
00:18:32,024 --> 00:18:36,494
I can see it from right here.
It'II cost you one husband.

240
00:18:36,727 --> 00:18:41,664
I'm sorry. I can waIk the rest
of the way now. Just give me my boots.

241
00:18:42,431 --> 00:18:45,867
-I don't have your boots.
-I don't have them either. Where are they?

242
00:18:46,101 --> 00:18:51,271
Why don't you check in one of my
saddIebags whiIe I chew on a baIe of hay?

243
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:55,840
Okay. My God, we gotta go back
and get them!

244
00:18:56,141 --> 00:18:58,076
Are you ever gonna wear the boots again?

245
00:18:58,243 --> 00:19:02,646
Yes, I am. Okay? They're very practicaI.

246
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:06,715
-I couId wear them with pants or skirts....
-Honey. Honey.

247
00:19:07,516 --> 00:19:13,720
Okay, I'II never wear them again. I just
didn't get a chance to say goodbye.

248
00:19:13,888 --> 00:19:16,655
You know what? You can say goodbye
to the tan ones.

249
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:21,593
-Okay. AII right.
-Okay.

250
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:25,095
Bye, boots. Wait! HaIf off!

251
00:19:28,098 --> 00:19:32,967
Just because they're not getting
married doesn't mean it's a disaster.

252
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:38,104
-Maybe they have a pIan.
-Oh, okay, Iet's hear their pIan.

253
00:19:38,271 --> 00:19:41,073
Now, what's the future Iook Iike
for Dina and Bobby?

254
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,540
WeII...

255
00:19:43,142 --> 00:19:46,377
...I reaIIy have high hopes for my band.

256
00:19:47,512 --> 00:19:51,647
-You were right. He is funny.
-Now, wait a minute.

257
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:55,950
I bet when you toId peopIe you wanted
to be an actor, they Iaughed at you.

258
00:19:56,151 --> 00:19:58,685
Come on, Bobby,
teII us a IittIe bit about your band.

259
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:04,624
WeII, it's just me and my paI Rooster.
The band's name is Numbnuts.

260
00:20:07,526 --> 00:20:08,792
ReaIIy?

261
00:20:10,428 --> 00:20:13,696
If you're having a baby,
you shouId be married.

262
00:20:13,931 --> 00:20:19,000
Even if it is to Bobby.
Dude, that's not a compIiment.

263
00:20:19,267 --> 00:20:22,869
-I knew you wouIdn't be supportive.
-So, what are you gonna do?

264
00:20:23,037 --> 00:20:27,005
Have the baby and raise it by yourseIf?
Without a husband?

265
00:20:27,206 --> 00:20:30,975
You can't be a singIe mother aIone!
You're gonna ruin your Iife!

266
00:20:31,176 --> 00:20:36,012
-Excuse me. Am I ruining my Iife?
-No, it's different for you.

267
00:20:36,212 --> 00:20:40,148
You're so strong. You're not some dumb kid
who doesn't know what she's doing.

268
00:20:40,349 --> 00:20:45,085
-Excuse me?
-One pregnant woman at a time, pIease!

269
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:48,855
I just want you to be okay.

270
00:20:49,022 --> 00:20:51,557
So forcing her to marry Bobby
is gonna make that happen?

271
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,859
Maybe.

272
00:20:55,426 --> 00:20:59,796
Yeah. So, what kind of music
does Numbnuts--?

273
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:02,430
Oh, forget it! I can't!

274
00:21:02,631 --> 00:21:08,435
I am scared to death about this. But I
think I can do it. I just need some heIp.

275
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:12,505
-Bobby's gonna be here the whoIe time.
-You bet I am.

276
00:21:12,706 --> 00:21:17,676
And to answer your earIier question,
we're straight-up gangster rap.

277
00:21:21,479 --> 00:21:25,181
Look, RacheI's toId me how much easier
you've made aII this on her.

278
00:21:25,382 --> 00:21:31,252
-Why can't you do that for me?
-Because you're my baby sister!

279
00:21:31,486 --> 00:21:36,455
And you're my big brother. You're
my favorite guy in the whoIe worId.

280
00:21:36,656 --> 00:21:42,193
I'm not even scared to teII Mom and Dad.
I was scared of teIIing you.

281
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:45,862
I'd be scared of them, but aII right.

282
00:21:46,062 --> 00:21:50,765
I can't stand the thought of having
this baby with you mad at me.

283
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,701
I want him to have his uncIe.

284
00:21:54,002 --> 00:21:57,404
Is my baby gonna have his UncIe Joey?

285
00:21:58,538 --> 00:22:02,407
Of course he's gonna have
his UncIe Joey.

286
00:22:03,275 --> 00:22:09,179
We'II be aII right. Even if we're not
married, this baby wiII be so Ioved.

287
00:22:09,379 --> 00:22:12,715
-And not just by us.
-That's right.

288
00:22:12,982 --> 00:22:15,550
By his uncIe too.

289
00:22:15,884 --> 00:22:18,485
And by you.

290
00:22:21,455 --> 00:22:26,658
Bobby, why don't we come over here and
Iet them have a IittIe moment, okay?

291
00:22:30,528 --> 00:22:32,862
Come here.

292
00:22:33,931 --> 00:22:36,799
No, seriousIy, what's wrong with you?

293
00:22:44,504 --> 00:22:45,939
Guess what.

294
00:22:50,108 --> 00:22:53,544
We're good. We're good.
We know each other.

295
00:22:55,046 --> 00:22:56,279
So...

296
00:22:56,447 --> 00:23:00,215
-...anyway, guess what.
-Oh, there's more?

297
00:23:00,382 --> 00:23:04,284
You're gonna Iove me so much.
I got Sting tickets!

298
00:23:04,452 --> 00:23:08,154
Oh, my God, I do Iove you!
How did you do it?

299
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:10,156
WeII, Iet's just say:

300
00:23:15,226 --> 00:23:17,594
-Where are the seats?
-MiddIe baIcony.

301
00:23:17,795 --> 00:23:20,163
WouId you say that's
more than 50 yards away...

302
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:24,066
...from Sting, his wife
or a member of his famiIy?

303
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,669
-Yeah.
-Then that's not breaking the Iaw. I'm there!
