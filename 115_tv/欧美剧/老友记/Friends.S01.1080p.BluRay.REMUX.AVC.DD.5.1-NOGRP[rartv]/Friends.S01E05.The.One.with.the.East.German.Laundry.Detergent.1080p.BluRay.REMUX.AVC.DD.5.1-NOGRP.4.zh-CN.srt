1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,900
别再争了好吗? 这又没什么大不了的
Let it go. It's not a big deal.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:09,040
没什么大不了?这简直是太神奇了 你够到之后，把它扯下来
Not a big deal? It's amazing. You reach in,there's one maneuver and bam!

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,400
胸罩就从袖子出来了
A bra. Right out the sleeve.

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:16,640
据我所知，男生可没有那样简单的事情 对不对?
As far as I know,guys don't do anything that comes close. Right?

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,870
拜托，男生可以站着尿
Come on! You guys can pee standing up.

6
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,640
我们行吗?我倒要试试看
We can? Okay,I'm trying that.

7
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,710
知道什么最令我嫉妒?
Know what blows my mind?

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,120
女人随时都可以看自己的胸部
Women can see breasts anytime they want.

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,560
低头一看…它就在那里
You look down,and there they are.

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,700
真搞不懂你们怎么会有心工作
How you get any work done is beyond me.

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,290
知道我搞不懂什么吗? 男人可以做许多下流的事…
I don't get how guys can do so many mean things...

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,900
…却能毫不在乎
...and not even care.

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,770
多重性高潮  没错
-Multiple orgasms! -There you go.

14
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,010
六人行 第1季 第05集 洗衣服
The One With the East German Laundry Detergent

15
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,430
了不起,周末夜,重要的夜晚
Saturday night. The big night!

16
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,540
约会的夜晚…周末夜…
Date night! Saturday night. Saturday night!

17
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:55,170
- 没有计划是吗? - 一个都没有
-No plans,huh? -Not a one!

18
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,200
连和珍妮丝分手的打算都没有?
Not even breaking up with Janice?

19
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,680
对…闭嘴
Right,right. Shut up.

20
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,580
钱德，没有人喜欢分手
Chandler,nobody likes breaking up with someone.

21
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,690
凯文・米勒除外，愿他在地狱里烂掉
Except for Kevin Millmore,may he rot in hell.

22
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,620
-你明白的 -我知道,但是这确实太难了
-You just gotta do it. -I know. But it's just so hard.

23
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,760
你坐在她身旁…而她却一无所知
You're sitting there with her. She has no idea.

24
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,490
最后你鼓起勇气
You finally get up the courage to do it.

25
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:24,370
在这实在尴尬的时刻 当你将纸条拿给她
There's that awkward moment when you've handed her the note.

26
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:30,910
在她看完纸条之前,你尝试着跑出饭店
You try to run out of the restaurant before she's finished the note.

27
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:37,220
干嘛分手?…像个男人样，不再打电话就行了
Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man. Just stop calling.

28
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,650
如果愿意，我和你一起做
If you want,I'll do it with you.

29
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,480
谢了，但这样她会认为 我们是联手来对付她
She'd feel like we're ganging up on her.

30
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,390
你和珍妮丝分手 我和东尼分手
You dump Janice,I'll dump T ony.

31
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,060
-东尼?你要和东尼分手? -他人很好.但是我对他再没新鲜感了
-You're breaking up with T ony? -He's sweet,but it's not fun anymore.

32
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,600
我不知道问题是在于我 还是他的绝食抗议
I don't know if it's me or his hunger strike,I don't know.

33
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,470
还有人需要什么吗?
Do you want anything else?

34
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:04,200
你做了有核果，巧克力之类的派…
You had a nutty,chocolate-y,kind of cake-y,pie thing that

35
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,580
没事，我还好
Nothing. I' m fine.

36
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,390
怎么啦,怪怪的
What's wrong? Why so scrunchie?

37
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:16,520
是我爸…他要买奔驰敞篷车给我
My father wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.

38
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,990
那家伙真叫我生气
That guy,he burns me up.

39
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,390
如果想要奔驰我就得搬回家了
Yeah,it's a Mercedes if I move back home.

40
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,500
太可恶了…他称我为“年轻的女士”
It was horrible! He called me "young lady. "

41
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,730
我最受不了我爸这样叫我
I hate when my father calls me that.

42
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,500
他是不是又说你年纪太轻之类
Did he say "You' re not up to this" again?

43
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:36,700
对,他在这次加长版中说了三次…
I got the extended version with choruses of...

44
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,180
…“你不可能独立”
... "You'll Never Make it on Your Own. "

45
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,380
嘿,乔伊
Hi,Joey.

46
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,790
天呀,安吉拉
Oh,my God! Angela!

47
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:51,150
被你甩掉对她大有好处
Wow! Being dumped by you agrees with her.

48
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:56,300
-你想过去吗? -不,是的，不
-Are you gonna go over there? -No. Yeah. No.

49
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,170
不,我不.我不想显得太渴望了
Okay,but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager.

50
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,540
一个密西西比,两个密西西比
One Mississippi,two Mississippi...

51
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,180
…三个密西西比.那看起来真酷
...three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool.

52
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,710
-安吉拉 -乔伊
-Hey,Angela. -Joey.

53
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,250
你看起来不错
You look good.

54
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,990
因为我的衣服突显出我的胸部
That's because l' m wearing a dress that accents my boobs.

55
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,530
看得出来
You don't say.

56
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,960
瑞秋，你今晚有何节目?
So,Rachel,what are you doing tonight?

57
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:37,300
精彩丰富，我要和莫妮卡去洗衣店
Big glamour night. Me and Monica at Launderama.

58
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:43,740
想知道有个巧合吗? 猜猜谁也要去洗衣店?
You wanna hear a freakish coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?

59
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,340
-谁? -我
-Who? -Me!

60
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,520
难道还不够清楚?
Was that not clear?

61
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,120
何不…
Why don't...?

62
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,450
何不让我加入你们?
Why don't I just join you both there?

63
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,790
你的公寓没有洗衣间吗?
Don't you have a laundry room in your building?

64
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,920
是的
Yes.

65
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:06,530
有，我的公寓有洗衣间
I do have a laundry room in my building.

66
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,300
但是现在有老鼠了
But there's a rat problem.

67
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,070
它们显然对烘干机里的香料纸感兴趣
Apparently,they're attracted to dryer sheets.

68
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:19,140
进入时还好 出来时却毛绒绒的
They're going in fine,but they're coming out all fluffy.

69
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,610
-7点左右见? -好的
-Anyway,7-ish? -Sure.

70
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,420
-免了,我现在和鲍伯交往 -鲍伯?谁是鲍伯?
-Forget it. I' m with Bob now. -Bob? Who the hell's Bob?

71
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:37,390
鲍伯简直是棒透了 聪明，成熟，又有真正的工作
Bob is great. He's smart,sophisticated,and he has a real job.

72
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,400
你每个月面试三次就称自己是演员 但是鲍伯
You go on three auditions a month and you' re an actor. Bob

73
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,830
我们在一起时很开心
Come on! We were great together.

74
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:49,770
不只是寻欢作乐我们也聊得来
And not just at the fun stuff,but,like,talking too.

75
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:57,270
抱歉,乔伊 你曾说我们当朋友就好,那么
Sorry,Joey. You said," Let's be friends. " So guess what?

76
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,610
-什么? -我们只是朋友
-What? -We' re just friends.

77
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,520
行
Fine. Fine.

78
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,590
我们四个何不一起出去吃晚饭? 就像朋友一样
Why don't the four of us have dinner tonight? As friends.

79
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,120
哪四个?
What "four of us"?

80
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,490
你和鲍伯,我和我的女友…
You and Bob,and me and my girlfriend...

81
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,720
…莫妮卡
... Monica.

82
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,700
要我说,这小伙绝对适合你
I' m telling you,this guy's perfect for you.

83
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,840
算了吧,从你那打嗝会嗝出字母表的表兄后 我再也不敢了
Forget it! Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.

84
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,440
没骗你，他真的很棒 他叫鲍伯，安吉拉的…
Come on,this guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's...

85
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:29,110
…哥哥 鲍伯简直是太棒了 聪明，成熟
... brother. He's smart,he's sophisticated...

86
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,110
…又有真正的工作
...and he has a real job.

87
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:35,410
我呢?我每个月面试三次就称自己是演员
I go on three auditions a month and say l' m an actor,but he's

88
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,090
-上帝啊 -什么?
-God help us. -What?

89
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,950
丑陋的裸男在铺厨房瓷砖
Ugly Naked Guy is laying kitchen tile.

90
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,060
我在求你帮忙
Look,l' m asking a favor here.

91
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:50,970
如果我能为她哥哥做点事 或许她会回到我身旁
If I do this for her brother,maybe Angela will come back to me.

92
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,400
你是怎么了? 你和千百个女人约会
What's going on? You go out with tons of girls.

93
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,740
我知道,但是安吉拉很不一样
I know,but Angela's different.

94
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:03,410
她就像那一种…那种雪花或者…
She's like one of a kind,like a snowflake or....

95
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,450
-其他像雪花的东西？ -是的,是的
-Something else like a snowflake? -Yeah,yeah.

96
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:13,420
我犯了天大的错误 我不该和她分手
Look,I made a huge mistake. I never should've broke up with her.

97
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,930
愿意帮我吗?求求你
Will you help me? Please?

98
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:27,900
等等…你能不能不要碰其他的东西
Hold on a sec. You need to not touch any of those.

99
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,980
没问题，再见
Okay,bye.

100
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,710
莫妮卡不能去了 现在只剩我和瑞秋
Monica's not coming. It's just gonna be me and Rachel.

101
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,680
等等，老兄你确定自己仔细想过
Hold on,camper. You've thought this through?

102
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:43,480
只是去洗衣服，没仔细想过
It's laundry. The thinking-through is minimal.

103
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,390
你是说只有你和瑞秋? 只有你们两个?
Just you and Rachel? Just you two?

104
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:50,090
这叫约会 你们要去约会
This is a date. You're going on a date.

105
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,530
-我有一阵子没干这个了啊 -她都不知道能算是约会吗?
-I haven't done that in a while. -ls it a date if she doesn't know?

106
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,480
当然是的 星期六晚上，什么规则都可以用
Yes,absolutely. Saturday night,all rules apply.

107
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:10,650
你在说些什么呢? 该再刮刮胡子或挑瓶美酒?
What are you saying? I should shave again? Pick up some wine?

108
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:14,480
或许你该再考虑你那肮脏的内衣裤
Well,you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear.

109
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,120
因为她将首度见到你的内衣裤 想让她看见你那肮脏的内衣裤吗?
It's the first time she'll see your underwear. You want it dirty?

110
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,990
不想
No.

111
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,890
衣物柔顺剂也有问题
And the fabric softener?

112
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:33,230
我的熊宝贝柔顺剂又怎么了?
Okay,now what is wrong with my Snuggles?

113
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:37,070
这代表我敏感贴心
What? It says I'm a sensitive,warm kind of guy.

114
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,410
就像一只毛绒绒的熊宝贝
You know,like a little fuzzy bear.

115
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:45,150
-好吧，我会在路上买其他牌子 -这才对
-I'll pick something else up. -There you go.

116
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,110
谢谢
Thank you.

117
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,590
鲍伯长什么样? 到底是高还是矮?
What does Bob look like? Is he tall,short?

118
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,290
-什么? -什么什么?
-Which? -Which what?

119
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:04,170
-你没和鲍伯见过面，对不? -对，可是…
-You've never met Bob,have you? -No,but

120
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:08,640
-拜托，这家伙可能相当… 嘿,乔伊
-For all we know,he's horribly -Hey,Joey!

121
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,970
非常的吸引人. 我闭嘴就是了
Horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.

122
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,450
他们在哪儿?他们在哪儿?
Where are they? Where are they?

123
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,420
感觉真好，我们俩从未独处过
This is nice. We never do anything,just the two of us.

124
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:28,150
对，或许明天 我们可以租辆车撞几只小狗
Great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car,run over some puppies.

125
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,830
我不想那样
I don't wanna do that.

126
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:35,060
-她来了 -祝你有个愉快的分手
-Here we go. -Have a good breakup.

127
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,470
-珍妮丝 -真高兴你打电话给我
-Hey,Janice. -My God,I am so glad you called me.

128
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,740
我从来没这么悲惨的一天
I had the most supremely awful day.

129
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,580
不妙
That's not good.

130
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,980
能端杯浓缩咖啡和拿铁来吗?
Can I get an espresso and a latte over here?

131
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:55,350
我们刚在有蔬菜的那个摄影小站拍了照 但那些蔬菜烂透了
We got the proofs from the shoot with the vegetables. They sucked.

132
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,620
我的整个下午就这样毁了 我去逛街购物
I blew off the afternoon. I went shopping.

133
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:01,730
然后就为你买…
And I got you....

134
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,930
我在找…我在找…
I'm looking. I'm looking.

135
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,990
我为你…
I' m looking.

136
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,500
-我为你… -什么?
-I got you -What?

137
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,400
-什么? -你帮我买什么?
-What? -What did you get me there?

138
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,230
我帮你买…
I got you...

139
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,640
…这个
...these.

140
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,810
驯鹿布威图案的袜子（《飞鼠洛基冒险记》中的动画角色）
Bullwinkle socks.

141
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,480
-真可爱 -我知道你已有松鼠洛基的了
-That's sweet. -I knew you had Rockys.

142
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:29,120
你可以穿一双布威的或穿一双洛基的,或混着穿
You can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle or Rocky and Rocky,or you can mix.

143
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,920
驯鹿和松鼠，随你高兴
Moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.

144
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:41,500
我再去叫一杯浓缩咖啡 想再来一杯拿铁吗?
I'm gonna get another espresso. More latte?

145
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,400
不用了，我的还没喝完
No,l' m still working on mine.

146
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,610
-你这样就搞定了？ -是的，你知道这样做很难
-That's it? -Yeah,it was really hard.

147
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:58,720
-没错，那个拥抱真惨烈 -你又不是当事人
-Yeah,the hug looked pretty brutal. -You weren't there.

148
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,450
-对不起 -事情处理的怎样?
-Sorry. -How are things going?

149
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,920
怎样?还没有进展. 她给我买了袜子
Going? Things are not going. She got me socks.

150
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:13,360
可以配你的洛基了啊! 她真的很关心你,对不起
These go with your Rockys. She really cares about you l' m sorry.

151
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,320
借过，让开…
Coming through. Move. Move!

152
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:37,290
抱歉，我用这台洗衣机
Excuse me! I was kind of using that machine.

153
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,920
是吗?不过现在不是了
Yeah,well,now you' re kind of not.

154
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:44,030
但是我占位置了,我放了篮子在上面
But I saved it. I put my basket on top.

155
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,760
抱歉，这是你的篮子吗?
I'm sorry. Is that your basket?

156
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:51,400
真漂亮， 但是我没看到肥皂水
It's pretty. Unfortunately,I don't see suds!

157
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,570
什么?
What?

158
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,940
没肥皂水就不算保留，行吗?
No suds,no save,okay?

159
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,180
怎么了?
What's going on?

160
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:06,220
没什么 这个凶女人抢了我的洗衣机
Nothing. This horrible woman just took my machine.

161
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,890
你有把篮子放上面吗?
Was your basket on top?

162
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,350
-有，但是没有肥皂水? -然后呢?
-Yeah,but there were no suds. -So?

163
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,390
-没肥皂水就不算保留 -没肥皂水,抱歉
-You know,no suds,no save. -No suds,no Excuse me.

164
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,530
等等 这是我朋友用的机器
Hold on a second! This is my friend's machine.

165
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,060
她的东西没在里面
Hey,hey,hey! Her stuff wasn't in it!

166
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,230
你明知根本没这个规矩
Hey,hey,hey! That's not the rule,and you know it!

167
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,340
表演结束
All right. Show's over.

168
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,880
没什么好看的
Nothing to see here.

169
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,020
洗衣服吧
Okay. Let's do laundry.

170
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:51,100
这简直是太神奇了 我连汤都不敢退
That was amazing! I can't even send back soup.

171
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:56,600
因为你是个温柔可爱的
Well,that's because you' re such a sweet,gentle....

172
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:02,100
你?你? 你得用洗衣粉
Do you? Do you? Oh,hey. You must need detergent.

173
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,610
-那是什么? 乌伯怀斯
-What's that? -Uberweiss.

174
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,120
来自德国的新产品 洗净力超强
It's new. It's German. It's extra tough!

175
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,620
瑞秋，你不打算分开洗吗?
Rach,are you gonna separate those?

176
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:22,520
天哪,我像个洗衣大白痴
Oh,God. Am I being a total laundry spaz?

177
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:27,960
我得用一台洗衬衣 用另一台洗裤子吗?
Am I supposed to use one machine for shirts and another for pants?

178
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,330
你没洗过衣服?
Have you never done this before?

179
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:37,770
没有，但我认识这样洗过的人
Well,not myself. But I know other people that have.

180
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:42,140
好吧，被你说对了 我没洗过衣服
Okay. You caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.

181
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:47,610
别担心，我会用轻柔绞洗
Don't worry. I'll use the gentle cycle.

182
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:55,590
你得用一台洗你全部的白衣白衣
Basically,you wanna use one machine for all your whites.

183
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,260
另一台洗其他颜色的衣服
A whole other machine for your colors.

184
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:02,960
第三台洗…
And a third for your...

185
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,730
…贴身.胸罩和…
...delicates. That would be your bras...

186
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,500
…内裤之类的
...and your underpanty things.

187
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,670
这些棉质的白色内裤呢?
These are white cotton panties.

188
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,780
与白衣还是贴身衣物一起洗?
Would they go with whites or with delicates?

189
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,650
随便你
That would be a judgment call.

190
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,090
他好帅
He's so cute!

191
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:30,590
你们在哪儿长大?
Where did you grow up?

192
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,420
-布鲁克林 -克里佛兰
-Brooklyn Heights. -Cleveland.

193
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,400
-怎么会这样? -天哪!
-How'd that happen? -My God!

194
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,200
怎么了
What?

195
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:43,230
我突然感到一阵晕眩
I suddenly had the feeling I was falling.

196
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:46,200
但是没有
But I'm not.

197
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,950
你和安吉拉在一起?
So,you and Angela,huh?

198
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,150
-差不多 -你真幸运
-Yep. Pretty much. -You' re a lucky man.

199
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,430
知道我最想念她什么?
Know what I miss most about her?

200
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:07,570
她轻啃东西的声音
That cute nibbly noise she makes when she eats.

201
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:10,530
好像是快乐的小松鼠…
Like a happy little squirrel...

202
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,730
…或是鼬
...or a weasel.

203
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,910
-我倒是没注意过 -以后注意听
-I never really noticed. -Oh,yeah,yeah. Listen for it.

204
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,700
莫妮卡，莫妮卡很好
Monica. Monica is great.

205
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,210
没错
Yeah,she is.

206
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:27,150
不过不会维持很久
But it's not gonna last.

207
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:30,480
她要的太多了…在床上
She's too much for me in bed.

208
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,760
性方面的
Sexually.

209
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:38,290
我得告诉你,鲍伯简直是太棒了
I've gotta tell you,Bob is terrific.

210
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,970
可不是吗
Yeah,isn't he?

211
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:45,800
能遇上聪明幽默 心智年龄超过八岁的人真棒
It's great to meet a smart,funny guy who's emotionally older than 8.

212
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:50,940
知道吗?他在床上更是不可思议
You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed!

213
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:58,050
我哥从未跟我谈过 他何时失去他的第一次
My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.

214
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,220
真好
That's nice.

215
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:09,390
你能办到的 这就像是拔创可贴一样
You can. It's like pulling off a Band-Aid.

216
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,590
快速拔起…露出伤口
Just do it really fast,and then the wound is exposed.

217
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,840
快去
Go! Go!

218
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,410
珍妮丝…
Hi,Janice.

219
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,620
我是说,我想我们不该再交往下去了
Here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore.

220
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,830
好的
All right.

221
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,230
我知道了…
Well,there you go.

222
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,630
停下来,停下来….
Stop it,stop it,stop it.

223
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,400
这和你无关
This isn't about you.

224
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:00,980
我知道,只是你害怕承诺
I know! It's about your fear of commitment.

225
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,940
我一点也不怕
I' m not afraid.

226
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,480
-拜托. -我不怕
-Please. -I don't!

227
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:08,780
-我不怕!我准备好了随时都可以承诺 -真的吗?
-I don't! I' m ready to commit anytime. -Really?

228
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,890
我知道这听起来很傻…
I know this is gonna sound stupid...

229
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,690
…但是我觉得如果我可以做这些
... but I feel that if I can do this...

230
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,230
…我想如果我可以自己洗衣服的话
...if I can actually do my own laundry...

231
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:21,200
…我就没有办不到的事
...there isn't anything I can't do.

232
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,800
我一点都不觉得傻
That does not sound stupid to me.

233
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:29,170
就像卡萝离开后,我第一次动手做晚饭
The first time I had to cook for myself after Carol left me

234
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,710
抱歉，时间到 接下来到我了
I'm sorry,that's all the time we have. Next on Ross....

235
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,280
怎么了?
-Uh-oh. -What?

236
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,120
衣服洗好了
Uh-oh....the laundry's done.

237
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,980
这是一首歌
It's a song.

238
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,060
我们唱的一首洗衣歌
The laundry song we sing.

239
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:50,460
衣服洗好了
Uh-oh! The laundry's done

240
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,660
-到底怎么了? -没事
-What's the matter? -Nothing.

241
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:55,230
衣服洗好了…
The laundry's done

242
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,590
罗斯，快给我看…
Come on,show me.

243
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:02,430
好吧，白衣中有一只红袜 所以白衣全变成…
It's just that you left a red sock with your whites,and now...

244
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,480
…全变成粉红色
...everything's kind of pink.

245
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,600
全变成粉红色?
Everything's pink?

246
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,650
对，但红袜还是红袜
Except for the red sock,which is still red.

247
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,690
抱歉，别伤心，任何人都可能发生这种事
Don't be upset. It can happen to anyone.

248
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,750
但是对我还是发生了
But it happened to me.

249
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:20,550
我穿这些看来会像一只棉花糖粉红猪
God,I'm gonna look like a big Marshmallow Peep!

250
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,590
我到底是怎么了?
What am I doing?

251
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,990
我爸说得对，我无法独立生活
My father's right! I can't live on my own.

252
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:29,240
我连洗衣服都不会
I can't even do laundry!

253
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:45,510
超狗（感恩节游行中的标志卡通形象）气球出了意外 它的头无法充气
Something went wrong with Underdog and they couldn't inflate his head.

254
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,850
于是…
So anyway...

255
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,450
…于是它的头就落在百老汇了
...his head is flopping down Broadway,right?

256
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:57,890
我心想这实在太不像话了
And I'm thinking how inappropriate this is.

257
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:02,560
有东西跑进我眼睛 能到灯下帮我看看吗?
Something's in my eye. Could we check it in the light,please?

258
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,810
-我的天呀! -怎么啦?
-Oh,my God! -What?

259
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,980
我们是坐在同一桌吗? 这就像是…
Were we at the same table? It's like...

260
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,940
…阿巴拉契亚的鸡尾酒会（太离谱了）
...cocktails in Appalachia.

261

-他们感情很好 -感情很好?她舌头都伸进了他的耳朵
-They' re close. -Close? Her tongue's in his ear.

262
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,750
你和罗斯就不会有小动作?
Like you've never got a little rambunctious with Ross.

263
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:30,620
乔伊，这令人太难受了，让人恶心
Joey,this is sick. It's disgusting. It's...

264
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,130
这不是真的，对不?
... not really true' is it?

265
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,100
谁说是真的?
Who's to say what's true?

266
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:39,310
-你到底在想什么? -好吧，我也不喜欢这样

-真的? -没错
-Really? -Yeah.

271
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:55,250
我想只要我们一起想办法
If we put our heads together,between the two of us...

272
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:57,980
就能让他们分开
...we can break them up.

273
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:02,830
真是抱歉没想到我会这样
I' m sorry. I can't believe I did this.

274

服务生，再来一盘鸡翅
Waiter? One more plate of chicken wings over here.

276

我们是不同类型的人
Here's the thing. We're different.

277
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,220
我就好像丁丁丁 你就好像梆梆梆
I'm bing,bing,bing. You' re boom,boom,boom.

你没事吧
Are you okay?

280
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,690
没事，只是我的隐形眼镜
It's just my lens. It's my lens.

281
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,060
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

282
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,130
我打中她的眼睛,眼睛

The clothes are clean. That's the important part.

293
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:48,330
大概吧…只是衣服都成了睡衣
I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.

294
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:57,240
抱歉，推车本来是我们的
I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.

295
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,140
我的腰围本来是24寸 你丢东西了
I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things.

296

让开，别挡道
Now,come on. Get out of my way.

抱歉，或许我没说清楚 这车是我们的
I' m sorry. Maybe I wasn't being clear. This was our cart.

这上面没有衣服
There weren't clothes in it!

299

你又再乱编规定了

-嘿,怎么样啦? -很好！

312
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:16,420
我们拆散那一对 并将他们占为已有
We ripped that couple apart and kept the pieces for ourselves.

313
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,920
真是美丽动人的故事
