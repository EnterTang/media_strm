1
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:16,391
We're running low on resumes.

2
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,353
You want a job
with Popular Mechanics?

3
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:23,565
If you're gonna work for mechanics,
those are the ones.

4
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:28,654
Guys, I'm going for anything here.
I can't be a waitress anymore.

5
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:33,992
I'm sick of the lousy tips.
I'm sick of being called "Excuse Me."

6
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:38,413
-Paper cut! Paper cut!
-Here.

7
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:43,752
Grapefruit juice! Grapefruit juice!

8
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,881
Okay, we're almost done.
Only 20 more to go.

9
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,678
-Rach, did you proofread these?
-Yeah. Why?

10
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:57,891
Nothing. I'm sure they'll be
impressed with your "compuper" skills.

11
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:03,188
Oh, my God!
Do you think it's on all of them?

12
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:10,112
No, I'm sure the Xerox machine
caught a few.

13
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:21,832
The One With the Poker

14
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:14,760
They call this a love seat but I'm not
feeling anything special towards you.

15
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,522
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

16
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:29,107
Hi, ladies.

17
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:32,778
Can I get you anything?
Did you bring the mail?

18
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:37,282
-Lots of responses.
-Really? Sure, we have scones left!

19
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:38,867
Read them.

20
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:43,664
"Dear Miss Greene:
Thank you for your inquiry. However"

21
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:50,254
-We have apple cinnamon
-"Dear Ms. Greene...." Yeah, yeah! No.

22
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,425
-What?
-Your Visa bill is huge!

23
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,928
Give me that.

24
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,557
Linda's great.
Why won't you go out with her?

25
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,059
-I don't know.
-ls this about her...

26
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:07,563
... "The Flintstones could
have really happened" thing?

27
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:12,401
It's not just that. I want someone
who does something for me...

28
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,611
...who gets my heart pounding.

29
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,698
Who makes me....

30
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:22,327
Little playthings with yarn?

31
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:24,788
What?

32
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:27,791
Could you want her more?

33
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,209
Who?

34
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,921
Dee, the sarcastic sister
from What's Happening!!.

35
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:43,140
Look, I'm totally over her.

36
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,641
-Hi!
-Coffee?

37
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,352
-No, we're fine.
-Okay.

38
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,777
-Shut up!
-We're not saying anything.

39
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:58,614
-What?
-Joey cried last night.

40
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:03,327
-Thank you.
-We were playing poker

41
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:07,789
There was chocolate on the three.
It looked like an eight.

42
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:11,460
You should have seen him.
"Read them and weep!"

43
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,462
And then he did.

44
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:18,467
Now, how come you guys
have never played poker with us?

45
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:22,804
Yeah, what is that?
Like some kind of sexist guy thing?

46
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:27,142
-It's poker, so only guys can play?
-No. Women can play.

47
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:32,147
Then, what is it? Some kind of, like,
some kind of, you know

48
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:34,316
All right, what is it?

49
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,986
There are just no women
in our game.

50
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:41,990
We just don't know any
women who know how to play poker.

51
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:45,619
That is a lame excuse.
It's a typical guy response.

52
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,788
Do you know how to play?

53
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:50,207
No.

54
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,336
-But you could teach us.
-No.

55
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:03,679
Okay, so now we draw cards.

56
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,976
So I wouldn't need any.
I have a straight.

57
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:12,104
-Oh, good for you!
-Congratulations!

58
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:18,402
-Pheebs, how many do you want?
-I just need two.

59
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:22,197
The 10 of spades and the 6 of clubs.

60
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:26,702
-No, you can't
-I have the 10 of spades! Here.

61
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,495
Thanks!

62
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:34,501
-No, you can't do that.
-Don't need them. I'm going for fours.

63
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,378
Oh, you're

64
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:42,009
You're going for fours.
Chandler, could you? Thanks, man.

65
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,182
Here we go.

66
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,476
We've got salmon roulettes
and crudites.

67
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,520
What are you doing?

68
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:57,566
In poker, there's no food
with more than one syllable.

69
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:01,820
It's got to be like chips
or dip or pretz

70
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:08,243
I hope you'll let it slide just
this once. I was all out of "pretz."

71
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:10,996
Now the dealer

72
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:14,917
We got it. Let's play for real.
High stakes. Big bucks!

73
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:20,172
You sure? Phoebe just threw away two
jacks because they didn't look happy.

74
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,803
But I'm ready. So just deal.

75
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,015
Okay, last-minute lesson!
Joey....

76
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:31,642
Three.

77
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,851
Eight.

78
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:36,605
Eight. Three.
All right, very good.

79
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:42,528
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

80
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:46,281
Joey had two fives showing,
so for you to raise was

81
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,158
Yes?

82
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:50,619
Downright gutsy.

83
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,958
-I see, so you were lying.
-About what?

84
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:59,336
-About how good your cards were.
-I was bluffing.

85
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,589
And what is bluffing?

86
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:07,803
Is it not another word for lying?

87
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:13,225
Sorry to break up this party, but I've
got to go fax resumes before work.

88
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,894
-We've got to settle.
-Settle what?

89
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:20,148
The Jamestown colony of Virginia.

90
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:24,987
See, King George is giving us
the land....

91
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:31,869
-The game, Rachel. You owe us money.
-Right.

92
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:35,747
It's their first time.
Let's forget about the money.

93
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,584
Hell, no. We'll pay!

94
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:42,171
Monica, I had another
answer all ready.

95
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:46,133
And you know what?
We want a rematch.

96
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:49,887
That's fine with me.
Could use some money.

97
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:56,476
-You're enjoying this, aren't you?
-Well, yeah, I am.

98
00:07:56,894 --> 00:08:01,106
So you get your ya-yas
by taking money from your friends.

99
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:05,986
Yes, and I get my ya-yas from KEA.

100
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:11,533
You have to put them together
yourself, but they cost less.

101
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:15,078
Look, this is poker.
I play to win.

102
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,748
For me to win,
others have to lose.

103
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:21,502
If you're gonna play,
don't expect me to be nice.

104
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,630
Because once those cards are dealt....

105
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,349
Yeah?

106
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:41,188
I'm not a nice guy.

107
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,196
All right, let's eat.

108
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:53,242
Did you get that
from the "I Love Rachel Pizzeria"?

109
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:57,496
-You still on that?
-What was with that Black Bart speech?

110
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:01,083
"When I play poker,
I'm not a nice guy."

111
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,252
You're way off.

112
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:07,089
No, I don't think so,
because I think you love her!

113
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:12,511
No. I might have had feelings
for her at one time. Not anymore.

114
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:13,762
I just

115
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:17,307
Marcel! Where are you going
with that disk?

116
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:20,018
You are not putting that on again.

117
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:24,189
If you press that button,
you are in very big trouble.

118
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:57,639
You believe what a jerk
Ross was being?

119
00:09:57,848 --> 00:10:01,393
-Yeah, I know.
-He can get really competitive.

120
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:05,314
What?

121
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:08,984
"Hello, kettle? This is Monica.
You're black!"

122
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:10,986
Please!

123
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:15,866
I'm not as bad as Ross.

124
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:19,536
I beg to differ.
The Pictionary incident?

125
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:21,830
That wasn't an incident.

126
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:26,502
I was gesturing and the plate
slipped out of my hand.

127
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,800
-I got an interview!
-You're kidding! Where?

128
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:36,762
Saks Fifth Avenue.

129
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,680
Oh, Rachel!

130
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,601
It's like the mother ship
is calling you home.

131
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:50,067
-What's the job?
-Assistant buyer.

132
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:53,070
I would be shopping!

133
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:56,657
For a living!

134
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:01,954
That's Aunt lris. She's been
playing poker since she was 5.

135
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:05,123
You've got to listen
to every word she says.

136
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:08,544
-ls Tony Randall dead?
-I don't think so.

137
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:12,381
-He may be now. I hit him with my car.
-My God, really?

138
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:16,051
No, that's bluffing.
Lesson number one.

139
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:22,933
Let me tell you something. Everything
you hear at a poker game is pure crap!

140
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,644
-Nice earrings.
-Thank you.

141
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:32,651
-Girls, sit down.
-Aunt lris, this is Phoebe and Rachel.

142
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,780
Listen, I'm parked at a meter.
Let's do it. Okay?

143
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:40,117
We'll start with five-card draw.

144
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:46,248
Then we'll go into the studs and the
hold 'ems. I talked to Cousin Nathan.

145
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:49,877
Don't touch the cards
when somebody is dealing.

146
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:55,716
How is Nathan?

147
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:59,469
Now he thinks he's a man
in a woman's body.

148
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:02,764
Don't you mean
a woman in a man's body?

149
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,434
It should be so simple.

150
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:19,489
Ross, could we please listen
to anything else?

151
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,575
All right.

152
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:39,676
I'm gonna pay for that tonight.

153
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:47,643
Hi. Guys, guess what?

154
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:52,648
The fifth dentist caved, and now
they're all recommending Trident?

155
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,739
No, the interview!

156
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:04,034
Unbelievable!
She absolutely loved me.

157
00:13:04,243 --> 00:13:08,163
We talked for over two hours.
We've the same taste in clothes.

158
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:10,791
And I went to camp with her cousin.

159
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:15,462
-The job is perfect! I can do this.
-That's great!

160
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:19,758
-Then she told a funny story.
-Great, tell us and we'll laugh.

161
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:22,010
Let's play poker!

162
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:27,933
Listen, we talked about it and
if you don't wanna play, it's okay.

163
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:33,063
Yes, we can play some other game.
Like Pictionary?

164
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:36,233
Very funny.

165
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:40,487
-But we'd like to try poker again.
-Yes, I think we should.

166
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:46,368
-Do you want me to shuffle those?
-That's okay, I'm gonna give it a go.

167
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:58,213
So Pheebs owes $7. 50.
Monica owes $10.00.

168
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:01,425
And Rachel, you owe 1 5 big ones!

169
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:07,598
Thanks for teaching us Cross-Eyed
Mary. We gotta play that other way.

170
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:12,352
All right, here's my $7.50.
But this money is cursed.

171
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:15,189
-What?
-I cursed it!

172
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:19,401
Now bad things will happen
to the spender.

173
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:23,572
I'll take it.
Bad things happen to me anyway.

174
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:26,992
This way, I can split them up
with a movie.

175
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:32,498
So that just leaves the big Greene
poker machine, who owes 1 5.

176
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:36,585
Could you be any smugger?

177
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:40,380
Let's see. Rach, I'm opening up
a new art gallery...

178
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:45,594
...and I could sure use the portraits
of Lincoln and Hamilton.

179
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:51,266
It's so typical.
"I'm a man! I have a penis!

180
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:55,687
I have to win money
to exert my power over women!"

181
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:00,275
This isn't over.

182
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:03,695
We'll play you again.
We'll win. You'll lose.

183
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:05,614
You'll beg. We'll laugh.

184
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:11,078
We'll take every last dime you have.
And you'll hate yourselves forever!

185
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:16,333
Kind of stepped on
my point there, Mon.

186
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:19,962
I can't believe you lost!
How much did they take?

187
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,047
Like 30 bucks.

188
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:24,967
-I'll give you that money back.
-Really?

189
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:29,054
No, I'm bluffing!
You guys haven't learned crap!

190
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:34,434
-Hand me the cards!
-Can l?

191
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:36,436
Yes!

192
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:48,490
Wanna give us your money now? We can
skip the formality of really playing.

193
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:53,036
No, that's fine. We'll see who has
the last laugh, monkey boy.

194
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:59,126
Done with chitchat?
Ready for serious poker?

195
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:03,422
You guys, look! The one-eyed jack
follows me wherever I go.

196
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:06,550
Right. Serious poker.

197
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:11,471
-Mon, got any more of those salmon?
-You want to eat or play poker?

198
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,850
-Where are you going?
-To the bathroom.

199
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:17,853
Want to go to the bathroom
or play poker?

200
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:19,688
Go to the bathroom.

201
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,651
-Well, I'm gonna order a pizza.
-No!

202
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:29,740
I'm waiting to hear from that job.
The store closes at 9:00. Eat then.

203
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:34,161
That's fine. I'll just have a Tic Tac
to hold me over.

204
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:39,208
All right. Cincinnati. No blinds.
Everybody, ante.

205
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,375
Yes!

206
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:43,545
Or no.

207
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:50,511
-All right! Your money's mine, Greene.
-Your fly's open, Geller.

208
00:16:56,433 --> 00:17:02,397
You know what I just realized?
Joker is poker with a "J"!

209
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:06,235
Coincidence?

210
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:11,406
That's jo-incidence with a "C"!

211
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,212
-Phoebe?
-Yeah, I'm out.

212
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:28,882
-I'm in.
-Me too.

213
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:30,926
Me too.
What do you got?

214
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:36,348
You better hop out of the shower,
because I got a flush.

215
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:40,894
Well, well, well!

216
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:45,941
Hop back in, bucko,
because I got four sixes!

217
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:50,195
I got four sixes! I won!
I actually won! Oh, my God!

218
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:53,490
You know what?
I'll make a little Ross pile.

219
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:54,867
Look!

220
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:59,997
I think that one was Ross'.
And I think that one was Ross'.

221
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:05,252
Well, I have got your money
And you'll never see it

222
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,713
And your fly's still open

223
00:18:07,963 --> 00:18:09,923
I made you look

224
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:15,387
-I'm in.
-I couldn't be in-er.

225
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:18,182
Monica, in or out?

226
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,684
I hate this game!

227
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:29,985
Joey, your bet.

228
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:33,405
I fold like a hooker
who got hit in the stomach...

229
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:36,658
... by a fat guy
with sores on his face.

230
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:41,371
I'm out.

231
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:46,084
-Ross?
-I'm very in.

232
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,004
-Chandler?
-Couldn't be more out.

233
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:52,007
Me too. Rachel?

234
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:58,388
I will see you and I'll raise you.
Do you wanna waste another buck?

235
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:02,100
No, not this time.
What did you have?

236
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:04,228
-I'm not telling.
-Show them.

237
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:05,479
-No.
-Show them!

238
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:09,775
-Get your hands out of there!
-I've had dates like this.

239
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:15,030
Boy, you really can't stand
to lose, can you?

240
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:20,577
Your whole face is getting red.
Veins popping out of your temple!

241
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:24,164
Plus, that shirt doesn't really
match those pants.

242
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,296
-I'm not losing.
-You're definitely losing.

243
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:33,465
Hello. Rachel Greene.

244
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:38,220
Excuse me. It's about the job!

245
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:41,139
Barbara, hi! How are you?

246
00:19:45,936 --> 00:19:48,230
No, I understand.

247
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:54,027
Come on. No, I'm fine.
Don't be silly. Yeah.

248
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:57,990
But if anything else
opens up, please

249
00:19:58,198 --> 00:19:59,825
Hello?

250
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:19,178
Sorry, Rach.

251
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:22,639
There's gonna be lots
of other stuff.

252
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:24,349
Okay.

253
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:27,186
Where were we?

254
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:33,775
Five-card draw. Jacks are better.
Nothing wild. Everybody, ante.

255
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:39,364
-Look, Rach, we don't have to do this.
-Yes, we do.

256
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:43,785
-All right. Check.
-Check.

257
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:47,289
-I'm in for 50 cents.
-Call.

258
00:20:47,498 --> 00:20:49,291
I'm in.

259
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,294
I see your 50 cents...

260
00:20:52,503 --> 00:20:55,964
...and I raise you $5.

261
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,134
I thought it was a 50-cent limit.

262
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:02,304
I just lost a job,
I'd like to raise it $5.

263
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:04,973
Does anyone have
a problem with that?

264
00:21:05,516 --> 00:21:07,726
-Not at all.
-No.

265
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:13,440
Loser?

266
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:25,160
-No, I fold.
-What do you mean, you fold?

267
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:29,832
I thought that, "Once the cards
are dealt, I'm not a nice guy."

268
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,668
Were you just full of it?

269
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:46,849
I'm in.

270
00:21:47,683 --> 00:21:49,852
-How many do you want?
-One.

271
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:53,272
Dealer takes two.

272
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:56,567
-What do you bet?
-I bet $2.

273
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:01,113
Okay. I see your $2...

274
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:04,032
...and I raise you...

275
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:07,035
... 20.

276
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:13,709
I see your $20...

277
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:16,795
... raise you $25.

278
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:26,388
I see your $25
and Monica, get my purse.

279
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:34,730
Rachel, there's nothing in it.

280
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:38,275
Okay, then get me your purse.

281
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,200
-Here you go. Good luck!
-Thank you.

282
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,245
I saw your $25 and I raise you...

283
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:52,789
...seven.

284
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:54,917
teen!

285
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:05,511
Joey, I'm a little shy.

286
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:09,056
That's okay, Ross. You can ask me.

287
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:16,980
-What do you need?
-1 5.

288
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:19,107
-Here's 10.
-I got 5.

289
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:21,401
-Thank you.
-Good luck.

290
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:25,113
I am calling your 1 7.

291
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:27,157
What do you got?

292
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:39,837
Full house.

293
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:47,845
You got me.

294
00:23:58,522 --> 00:24:01,316
-That's tough to beat.
-I thought we had it!

295
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:05,404
When you don't have the cards,
you don't have the cards.

296
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:08,031
But look how happy she is.

297
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:20,836
-Airmail.
-Airplane. Airport. Airport '75!

298
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:24,256
Airport '77! Airport '79!

299
00:24:24,882 --> 00:24:26,466
Time's up!

300
00:24:26,675 --> 00:24:29,303
Bye Bye Birdie!

301
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:33,223
That's a bird?

302
00:24:33,432 --> 00:24:35,767
That's a bird!

303
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:38,937
Okay, it's my turn.

304
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:41,899
Go!

305
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:46,528
Bean! Bean!

306
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:50,407
The Unbearable Lightness of Being!

307
00:24:53,702 --> 00:24:55,370
That you get?

308
00:24:55,579 --> 00:24:57,873
That you get?!
