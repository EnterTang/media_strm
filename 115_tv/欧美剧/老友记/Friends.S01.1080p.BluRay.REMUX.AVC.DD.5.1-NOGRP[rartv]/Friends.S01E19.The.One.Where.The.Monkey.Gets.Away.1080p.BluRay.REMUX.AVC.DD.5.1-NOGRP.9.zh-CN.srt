

1
00:00:02,902 --> 00:00:04,028
我刚看过了
Okay, I checked.

2
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:07,900
我们有伯爵茶,英式早餐茶,肉桂茶
We have Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon Stick...

4
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:14,807
还有…柠檬派
Wait, there's one more. Lemon Soother!

5
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:20,015
你不是那个要喝茶的人对吧?
You're not the guy that asked for tea, are you?

6
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:25,248
六人行 第1季 第19集 猴子被送走
The One Where The Monkey Gets Away


8
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,632
瑞秋,你有信
Mail call! Rachel Greene, bunk seven.

9
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:16,468
谢谢
Thank you.

10
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:20,942
酷,免费试喝的咖啡
Oh, cool! A free sample of coffee.

11
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:25,049
太好了,因为在哪儿还有免费的咖啡?
Oh, good. Because where else would we get any?

12
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,582
哦,是啊
Oh, right.

13
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:31,589
-太好了 -那是什么?
-Oh, great. -What is it?

14
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,622
乡村俱乐部的每日公报
Country club newsletter.

15
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,661
我妈寄来通知有人要订婚了
My mother sends me the engagement notices for inspiration.

16
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,365
噢,我的天!是巴瑞和明蒂
Oh, my God! It's Barry and Mindy!

17
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:45,467
巴瑞,你几乎…
Barry, who you almost

18
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:47,264
明蒂,你的伴娘
And Mindy, your maid of

19
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:50,032
我看看,那是明蒂?
Let me see. That's Mindy?

20
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,470
真漂亮!
She is pretty!

21
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,040
她真幸运…
Lucky...

22
00:01:56,616 --> 00:02:00,211
有你这样的朋友
...to have had a friend like you.

23
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,545
现在是静默时间
Now it's quiet time.

24
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:12,029
马修,拿饭给我,快…
Marcel, bring me the rice. Come on.

25
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:13,994
好小子.把饭给我
Good boy. Give me the rice.

26
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:15,928
真乖,谢谢
Thank you. Good boy.

27
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:21,468
他终于能分辨“拿来”和“尿在”的差别了
He's mastered the difference between "bring me the" and "pee in the."

28
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,810
瑞秋怎么啦?
"Bring me the" and Rach?

29
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,540
抱歉
Oh, I'm sorry.

30
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,179
我真是太笨了
This is so stupid!

31
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,580
是我不要巴瑞的,对吧?
I mean, I gave Barry up, right?

32
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:37,847
我应该为他们高兴
I should be happy for them.

33
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:39,752
我…真为他们高兴
I am. I'm happy for them.

34
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:42,793
-真的? -不
-Really? -No.

35
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:46,990
如果我和别人在一起就不同了
I guess it would be different if I were with somebody.

36
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,565
谁,什么…
Whoa, what....

37
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:54,034
你不是说要忘了那段感情,不再和男人在一起
What happened to "Forget relationships! I'm done with men!"

38
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,073
厌恶男人吗?
The whole penis embargo?

39
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:02,640
我不知道
I don't know.

40
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:07,080
我想这不是没有男人的问题, 而是合适男人的问题
It's not about no guys. It's about the right guy.

41
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:11,517
和巴瑞在一起安全自在 但是没有激情
With Barry it was safe and easy, but there was no heat.

42
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:15,125
和保罗在一起就充满激情
With Paolo, all there was, was heat.

43
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:19,992
-如野兽般原始的性爱 -好了,我懂
-lt was this raw, animal, sexual -Right. I got it.

44
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,061
我看过你们两个在一起的样子
I was there.

45
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,197
你认为我能两者同时拥有吗?
Do you think you can have both?

46
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:30,172
找到一个能当知己 又能让我感受到激情的人?
Someone who's your best friend but also can make your toes curl.

47
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,469
是呀
Yes.

48
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:35,204
我也这么认为.我真的这么认为
Yes, I do. I really do.

49
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,750
其实说来好笑
In fact, it's funny.

50
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:40,920
时常你认为
Often, someone you wouldn't think could...

51
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,385
无法让你感受到激情的人
...curl your toes...

52
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,956
却是…
... might just be the one who...

53
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:48,792
被打断了
...gets interrupted.

54
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,654
电影如何?
How was the movie?

55
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:52,558
-很不错 -很不错
-Wonderful! -So good!

56
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:55,700
-逊毙了 -根本是小妞们看的嘛
-Suck fest. -Total chick flick.

57
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:02,434
真遗撼这不是枪林弹雨
I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with guns and bombs...

58
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,872
公车速度奇快的那种电影
...and buses going really fast!

59
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:09,807
暴力并不能吸引我
I don't need violence in a movie...

60
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,745
只要有裸体镜头我就满足了
...as long as there's a little nudity.

61
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:16,510
-那电影也有裸体镜头 -我是指女生的裸体镜头
-There was nudity. -I meant female nudity.

62
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:20,090
我不爱看卢葛兰的春宫
I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.

63
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,227
休葛兰特!
Hugh! Hugh Grant!

64
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,288
我得走了
All right, I've got to go.

65
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:27,932
走吧,马修,快
Come on, Marcel.

66
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:31,934
我们去洗澡,对不对?对
We're gonna go take a bath. Yes, we are, aren't we?

67
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:35,431
他们只是朋友吗?
They're still just friends, right?

68
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,805
明天见
And I will see you tomorrow.

69
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,072
对,你明天要到瑞秋阿姨家
You're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's.

70
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,117
等等,摩尼卡阿姨能说句话吗?
Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?

71
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,187
摩尼卡阿姨请说?
Please, Aunt Monica, please?

72
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:53,688
别紧张了,你不会在这儿的
Unclench. You're not even gonna be here.

73
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:05,103
-我无法相信我们竟在讨论此事 -我同意,我也无法相信
-I can't believe we're discussing this. -I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.

74
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:09,130
如果你和瑞秋会爱情产生的话? 还会一直拖到现在吗?
If it was gonna happen, wouldn't it have happened already?

75
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:13,969
她说她在寻找像我这样的人
She said she wants a relationship with someone exactly like me.

76
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:15,475
她真的这样说?
She said that?

77
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:19,014
“像我这样”是我自己加的
I added the exactly like me" part.

78
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:23,879
她说她在寻找某人,而此人今晚就会出现
But she's looking for someone. And someone will be there tonight.

79
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,388
今天晚上?
"Tonight" tonight?

80
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:28,456
这样最好不过了,因为只有我们两个
It's perfect. It'll just be the two of us.

81
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:32,290
她整天都在照顾我的猴子
She spent all day taking care of my monkey.

82
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:38,363
我早已忘记哪个女人照顾过我的猴子
I can't remember the last time a girl took care of my monkey.

83
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,335
总之下班后我要去买瓶酒…
Anyway, I figured after work, I'd pick up some wine...

84
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:50,243
去向她“示爱”
...go over there and try to woo her.

85
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,342
Know what you should do? 知道你该怎么做吗?
Know what you should do?

86
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:57,853
带她回到用“示爱”的十九世纪去
Take her back to the 1 890s when that phrase was last used.

87
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:05,757
如果你继续这样,我发誓这星期内 你就可以和这个浑蛋结束
If you keep this up, you'll be finished by the weekend.

88
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,259
围羽毛围巾的是法博土
The one in the feathered boa is Dr. Francis.

89
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,834
她曾是个男人
Now, she used to be a man.

90
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:13,903
蕾文出现了
Look, there's Raven.

91
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:17,508
我们讨厌她,真高兴她就快死了
We hate her. We're glad she's dying.

92
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,176
什么?马修!
And then What? Marcel!

93
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:24,549
想玩摩妮卡的鞋吗?你不能玩…
Are you playing with Monica's shoes? You're not supposed to

94
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:30,289
马修,你在鞋里大便?
Marcel, did you poo in the shoe?

95
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,254
天啊,坏猴子
Oh, Marcel! Bad monkey!

96
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,422
哦,天哪!
Oh, God!

97
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:42,533
抱歉,巴瑞
Sorry, Barry.

98
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:45,128
一份小小的订婚礼物
A little engagement gift.

99
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:48,306
我相信你没登记
I'm sure you didn't register for that.

100
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:58,212
谁死了?谁死了?
Who died? Who died?

101
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,148
翻过去!好不好,翻过去!
Roll him over! Come on, roll him over!

102
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:06,454
好吧,我们知道不是崔斯勒, 因为…马修?…
Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right, Marcel? Because

103
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:07,648
马修?
Marcel?

104
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:14,131
-你怎会把它弄丢了呢? -天晓得
-How could you lose him? -I don't know!

105
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,736
我正在看电视, 它在摩妮卡的鞋内大便
We were watching TV, he pooped in Monica's shoe....

106
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,872
它在我的鞋里大便?哪一双?
Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?

107
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:23,974
我不知道,左脚
I don't know. The left one!

108
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:25,235
是哪一双?
Which ones?

109
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:29,779
搭配什么都好看的阿米许鞋
Those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.

110
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:36,649
为何一片愁云惨雾?
Why is the air in here so negative?

111
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,319
瑞秋把马修弄丢了
Rachel lost Marcel.

112
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:40,581
不会吧,怎么丢的?
Oh, no! How?

113
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,819
-它在我鞋里大便 -哪只?
-He pooped in my shoe. -Which one?

114
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:45,326
我常穿的那只可爱黑鞋
The cute black ones I always wear.

115
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,690
是哪一只?
No, which one?

116
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,334
左脚还右脚?
The right or left?

117
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,897
因为左脚是幸运鞋
Because the left one is lucky.

118
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,902
大家快想办法!我该怎么办?
Come on! What am I gonna do?

119
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:58,669
有了,如果你是只猴子,迷失在大城市时
All right. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city.

120
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,879
你会去哪儿?
Where do you go?

121
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:05,081
这是它第一次出门, 所以大概和一般游客一样
It's his first time out, so he'll do touristy things.

122
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:11,954
我去百老汇找.你去俄罗斯茶坊
I'll go to Cats. You go to the Russian Tea Room.

123
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:15,187
别再闹了!
Oh, my God! Come on, you guys!

124
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,919
他马上就会回家,他不会饶过我的
He'll be home any minute. He's gonna kill me!

125
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:22,362
我们从这栋公寓开始找起 你们找一楼和二楼,菲比和我找三楼和四楼
Search the building. Take the first floor. We'll take the rest.

126
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:23,967
我该怎么办?
What am I gonna do?

127
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,671
你留在家里等电话
You stay here and wait by the phone.

128
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:30,468
在我鞋内啧芳香剂,顺便等罗斯回来杀你
Spray Lysol in my shoe and wait for Ross to kill you.

129
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,042
有人要交换吗?
Does anybody want to trade?

130
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,786
干嘛?
What do you want?

131
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:45,355
哈克先生,我们朋友遗失了一只猴子 你有看见吗?
Mr. Heckles, have you seen a monkey?

132
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:48,959
我放了威化饼在这儿,是不是你拿了?
I left a Belgian waffle out here. Did you take it?

133
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:53,498
-你怎会放威化饼在走廊? -我还不想吃
-Why'd you leave it in the hall? -I wasn't ready for it.

134
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,991
你有看见猴子吗?
Have you seen a monkey?

135
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,000
我看过“理吉斯菲邦”
I saw Regis Philbin once.

136
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:01,871
谢谢你,哈克先生
Thank you, Mr. Heckles.

137
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,704
你们欠我威化饼
You owe me a waffle.

138
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:10,006
他是一只白脸的黑卷尾猴
He's a black capuchin monkey with a white face...

139
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:15,277
加俄国酱外加腌黄瓜
...with Russian dressing and pickles on the side.

140
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:16,647
好,谢谢
Thanks.

141
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:19,823
今天过得如何?
How did it go today?

142
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,927
很好啊!很好啊.真的很不错
Oh, great! It went great. Really great.

143
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,493
那是酒吗?
Is that wine?

144
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,755
是的,想喝吗?
You want some?

145
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,695
我非常乐意来点
Oh, I would love some.

146
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:31,267
可是我们别在这儿喝
But let's not drink it here.

147
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:35,201
我感觉有点疯狂,我们去纽华克好吗?
I'm feeling crazy. You wanna go to Newark?

148
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:44,515
前往这东北犯罪首府之前…
Okay, but before we head off to the murder capital of the Northeast...

149
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:48,012
…我有些话想说
... I kind of wanted to run something by you.

150
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,847
我们曾谈过…
You know how we were talking before...

151
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,890
…感情的问题
...about relationships, and stuff.

152
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:58,496
-罗斯,我受不了了! -你回绝得倒是很快嘛
-Oh, God, Ross, I cannot do this! -Okay, quick and painful.

153
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,199
哦,上帝啊!
Oh, God!

154
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:11,600
好吧,好吧
Okay, all right. All right, okay.

155
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,836
罗斯,别恨我
Please don't hate me.

156
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:15,035
到底是什么?
What?

157
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,781
马修它…
You know Marcel?

158
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,781
我把它…弄丢了
I kind of lost him.

159
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,337
我真不敢相信
I can't believe this.

160
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,738
我只是麻烦你别让它跑出去
All I asked you to do was keep him in here!

161
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,107
我知道,对不起
I know. I'm sorry.

162
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,215
不,我该负一半的责任
It's partially my fault.

163
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:54,182
我不该叫你照顾猴子
I shouldn't have had you start with a monkey.

164
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:57,345
应该叫你照顾铅笔才对
You should have started with a pencil.

165
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:02,458
罗斯,我已尽最大的努力 我已叫大家分头去找
I'm doing everything I can. Everyone's looking for him and I got

166
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,593
-是谁? -动物控制中心
-Who is it? -Animal Control.

167
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:11,860
-瞧,我甚至打给动物控制中心 -你打给动物控制中心?
-I've even got Animal Control. -You called Animal Control?

168
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:16,537
怎么了?你不喜欢他们?
Why? Do you not like them?

169
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:22,709
马修是非法的外来动物
Marcel is an illegal exotic animal.

170
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:30,915
我是非法饲养.万一被他们找到他们就会带走它
I'm not allowed to have him. If they find him, they'll take him away.

171
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:34,423
好吧,可是,你从来就没有告诉大家
Well, now, see, you never ever told us that.

172
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:39,358
没错,因为我没想到你会请他们来
Because I never expected you to invite them to the apartment!

173
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:46,070
谢谢你来
Thanks for coming.

174
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,433
有人遗失猴子?
Somebody called about a monkey?

175
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:52,133
对,这完全是个误会
You know, that was a complete misunderstanding.

176
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:54,973
我以为我们有养猴子, 但是我们没有
We thought we had a monkey, but we didn't.

177
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:57,082
-结果是帽子 -猫!
-Turned out it was a hat. -Cat!

178
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:01,981
我们查过了,没人看到马修
We checked, no one's seen Marcel.

179
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:06,522
-我叔叔马修 -那猴子是以你叔叔命名?
-My uncle Marcel. -ls that who the monkey's named after?

180
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:10,453
你知道持有非法外来动物
Possession of an illegal exotic is punishable...

181
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:14,157
可判刑两年并没收动物?
... by two years in prison and confiscation of the animal.

182
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:15,323
天啊
Oh, my God!

183
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:19,468
你要把这可怜的小东西关进监牢?
You'd put that poor little creature in jail?

184
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:29,276
菲比,你记得如何先对自己小声说吗?
Remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?

185
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:33,009
记得,但总不是时候
Yes, but there isn't always time.

186
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:40,155
我相信我们能以友善的处理方式,请坐
I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this. Have a seat.

187
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,828
首先,我们还没自己介绍,我叫摩妮卡
We haven't met. I'm Monica Geller.

188
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:45,722
天啊,你是莫尼卡
Oh, my God, you are!

189
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,626
还有,你是瑞秋对吗?
And you're Rachel Greene!

190
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,963
露莎,林肯高中
Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High?

191
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:55,538
我坐在你们后面
I sat behind you guys in homeroom.

192
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:59,473
露莎!哦,天哪!
Luisa! Oh, my God!

193
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,738
摩妮卡,是露莎
Monica! It's Luisa!

194
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:05,817
我也去了那里!
I went there too!

195
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,010
是在后面那个?
Luisa! From homeroom!

196
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,887
你们根本不知道我是谁对不?
You have no idea who I am, do you?

197
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:14,684
-不 -一点也不
-No. -Not at all.

198
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:19,624
或许你们那四年,都在当我不存在
Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me.

199
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:23,598
难道说“早安,露莎”
Would it have been hard to say, "Morning, Luisa"...

200
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,169
或“好漂亮的连身裤”有那么困难吗?
...or "Nice overalls"?

201
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,302
对不起
Oh, I'm so sorry!

202
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:36,846
我不怪你,你当时很胖, 你有自己的烦恼
It's not so much you. You were fat. You had your own problems.

203
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,013
可是你实在是个贱货
But you. What a bitch!

204
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:44,151
什么?
What?

205
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:46,791
别计较了
You know what? Be that as it may...

206
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:51,089
你真认为你能帮我们找猴子? 看在过去的份上?
...could you help us with the monkey thing, for old times'sake?

207
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,265
帮我们找
Go, Bobcats!

208
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:56,801
我可以,我不
I could. But I won't.

209
00:13:57,003 --> 00:14:00,268
如果我找到猴子,它就是我的了
If I find that monkey, he's mine.

210
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,345
抱歉
Sorry.

211
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:11,741
马修?
Marcel?

212
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:13,476
马修?
Marcel?

213
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,859
需要帮忙吗?
Hi, can I help you?

214
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:32,198
我们有急事,我们在找东西
We're having an emergency, and we were looking for something.

215
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:36,068
-猴子 -对,你有看见吗?
-A monkey. -Yes, have you seen any?

216
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,709
我没看见猴子
No, I haven't seen a monkey.

217
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,879
你知道如何修理散热器吗?
Can you fix radiators?

218
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,481
当然!你试过将转钮转回去吗?
Sure! Did you try turning the knob back the other way?

219
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:47,685
-当然! -那之后我就不知道了
-Of course! -Oh. Then, no.

220
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,827
-试试这个是不是加太多兰姆酒了? -等等
-Taste this. Is there too much rum? -Just a second.

221
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:58,588
-希望你们能找到猴子 -不,等等
-Hope you find your monkey. -No, wait!

222
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,534
我们对散热器或许不太懂
We may not know about radiators...

223
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:07,739
我们可是冷暖环境的专家
... but we do have expertise in the heating and cooling milieu.

224
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:13,677
我们不是正在忙吗?
Aren't we in the middle of something?

225
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:17,714
对,她们很热而且需要帮助
But these women are very hot, and they need our help.

226
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:20,715
而且很火辣
And they're very hot!

227
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,422
我们不行
We can't, all right?

228
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:26,089
抱歉你们不知道
We're sorry.

229
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:30,227
我们有多抱歉,我们答应人家要找猴子
You don't know how sorry. We promised to find this monkey.

230
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,558
它约这么高,名叫马修
He's this high and answers to the name Marcel.

231
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:38,100
如果能拥有你们的照片,就算是帮了大忙
So if we could get pictures of you, it'd help us out.

232
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:49,876
从现在起不准你和其他人讲话
From now on, you don't get to talk to other people.

233
00:15:58,324 --> 00:15:59,450
-噢,我的天! -什么?
-Oh, my God! -What?

234
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:02,651
有东西碰到我的右脚
Something brushed up against my right leg.

235
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,689
没什么,是我的左脚
Oh, it's okay. It was just my left leg.

236
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:09,256
看,菲比
Look, Phoebe!

237
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:12,061
马修,过来…
Oh, Marcel! Come here!

238
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,829
站过去,两位小姐
Step aside, ladies.

239
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:18,602
-你要干什么? -打镇定剂
-What are you gonna do? -Just a tranquilizer.

240
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:36,358
快跑,马修,快跑!
Run, Marcel, run!

241
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:37,685
坏了!
Damn!

242
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:41,263
-你还好吧? -还行.哦
-Are you okay? -I think so.

243
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:50,698
哦，糟了!
Oh, gosh!

244
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:06,055
我们把周围的邻居都找遍了, 它不见了,就这么消失了
We've been all over the neighborhood! He's just gone!

245
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:09,387
-罗斯,还不一定 -拜托,天气好冷天又黑
-You don't know that. -It's cold, it's dark.

246
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:11,859
它根本不认识路!
He doesn't know the Village!

247
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:17,001
现在我的脚又受伤了, 猴子没了还换来受伤的脚
And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey and a broken foot!

248
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,498
真的感谢你!
Thank you very much!

249
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,502
罗斯,我已向你道歉过无数次
I've said I'm sorry a million times.

250
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,434
你到底要我怎么样?
What do you want me to do?

251
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:27,610
你也要我的脚受伤?要我也把脚弄伤
You want me to break my foot too? I'll break it right now.

252
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:31,271
瞧,高兴了吧
Oh, my God! There, are you happy now?

253
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:35,250
对,你踢完路标后
Yeah, now that you kicked the sign...

254
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:38,946
我突然不再想念马修了
... I don't miss Marcel anymore!

255
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,955
我真的不是故意的
It's not like I did this on purpose.

256
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,255
当然,这是典型的瑞秋
No, this is just vintage Rachel.

257
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:48,295
这种事常发生在你身上
Things just sort of happen around you!

258
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:52,198
你活在自己的世界中 做着自己的事情…
You're off in "Rachel Land," doing your "Rachel Thing"...

259
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:56,739
完全无视别人的猴子, 或是别人的感觉…
...oblivious to people's monkeys or to people's feelings and

260
00:17:57,009 --> 00:18:00,103
罗斯,我不想听!忘了他,好不好?
I don't want to hear it! Forget it, okay?

261
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,173
什么?
What?

262
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:08,379
嗨,香蕉男!
Hey, banana man!

263
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,692
这下可好
This is so intense!

264
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:20,923
一边的屁股在睡觉, 另一边却毫无所知
One side of my butt is totally asleep and the other side has no idea.

265
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:27,438
-菲比怎么啦? -麻醉枪
-What's with Phoebe? -Tranquilizer dart.

266
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:31,306
你有订香蕉吗?
Hi! Did you order some bananas?

267
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,968
-那是干吗的? -还我的猴子
-What about it? -Give me my monkey back!

268
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:37,546
-我没猴子 -干嘛买一箱香蕉?
-I don't have a monkey. -Then what's with the bananas?

269
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,775
补充钾
Potassium.

270
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,454
马修?它在哪儿?
Okay, where is he?

271
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:49,357
你在浪费时间
You're wasting your time.

272
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:53,258
什么?
What?

273
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:06,233
-你对他干了什么? -这是我的猴子,它叫佩蒂
-What have you done to him? -That's my monkey. That's Patty.

274
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,576
你疯了不成?过来,马修…
Are you insane? Come here, Marcel.

275
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:12,811
过来,佩蒂
Come here, Patty.

276
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:14,509
过来,马修…
Come here, Marcel.

277
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:16,079
过来,佩蒂
Come here, Patty.

278
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:18,087
猴子过来…
Here, monkey.

279
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:19,616
过来,猴子!
Here, monkey!

280
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,589
总算逮到你了
Gotcha!

281
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,823
-把我的猴子还给我 -那是我的猴子
-Give me my monkey back! -It's mine.

282
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:27,022
你们到法官面前去争吧
Take this up with the judge.

283
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:31,795
那不是我的猴子 只有衣服是我的,随时可以送回来
That's not my monkey. The dress is mine. Send it back whenever.

284
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:33,905
好吧,我要我的猴子!
All right, I want my monkey!

285
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:37,099
-露莎,拜托 -抱歉了,舞会皇后
-Oh, come on, Luisa. -Sorry, prom queen.

286
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:40,541
你高中时干嘛那么贱,为何不当个胖妹?
You had to be a bitch in school, instead of fat.

287
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:45,215
在学校我是舞会皇后
In high school, I was prom queen...

288
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:49,080
返校皇后,但是你
...and the homecoming queen and you...

289
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:51,154
你也在的啊
...were also there.

290
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:56,018
但是这不是高中,我们现在都是成年人!
But this isn't high school. We're all adults here!

291
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:59,093
我能要这个吗?
Heckles! Can I have this?

292
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:01,424
随意
For the most part.

293
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:06,162
如果你把猴子带走 我将失去我生命中重要的人
If you take this monkey, I'll lose an important person in my life.

294
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:10,502
你可以恨我,请别折磨他
You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him.

295
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,907
此时你有机会成为大人物
You have a chance to be the bigger person here.

296
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:15,944
把握机会吧
Take it!

297
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:20,109
不
No.

298
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:25,348
那么,我只好告诉你的长官
All right. Then I'll call your supervisor and tell her...

299
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:28,392
你在我朋友的屁股上开了一枪
...you shot my friend with a dart!

300
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:38,432
终于能脱去这件衣服,不是吗?
It'll be nice to get this off, won't it?

301
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:41,607
或是这样也不错
Or we can leave it on. That's fine.

302
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:46,142
配上鞋就是完整的一套
With the right pumps, that would be a great little outfit.

303
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:54,016
抱歉,我对你这么凶
Listen, I'm sorry I was so hard on you before

304
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,348
不,这都是我的错,我差点…
No, it was my fault. I almost lost your

305
00:20:57,557 --> 00:21:01,254
不,它也是你找回来的,你做得很好
Yeah, but you got him back. You were great.

306
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:09,293
那瓶酒还在
We still have that bottle of wine.

307
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:13,403
有心情喝杯葡萄酒吗?
Are you in the mood for something grape?

308
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:16,870
-好呀 -很好
-Sure, that would be good. -All right.

309
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:30,149
隔壁一定在用吸尘器
The neighbors must be vacuuming.

310
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:39,921
只要我们在这儿…
Well, as long as we're here...

311
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:43,432
…不谈那个话题…
...and not on the subject....

312
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:47,035
我在想…
I was thinking about...

313
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:52,401
…我们刚刚实在是恶言相向
... how mad we got at each other before.

314
00:21:56,182 --> 00:21:59,549
大概是因为我们…
And maybe it was partially because of how we

315
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:02,017
-瑞秋? -瑞秋?
-Rachel? -Barry?

316
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:06,815
我办不到.我无法和明蒂结婚
I can't do it. I can't marry Mindy.

317
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:09,551
我想我爱的人依然是你
I think I'm still in love with you.

318
00:22:14,634 --> 00:22:18,502
我们得开始锁门了!
We have got to start locking that door!

319
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:27,843
给我们看看!来吗!
Show us! Come on!

320
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:31,983
-很久很久以前 -好吧
-lt was such a long time ago. -Okay, fine. All right.

321
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:36,349
这是我在“音乐之声”里面, 看见范崔普的孩子吗?
This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?

322
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:39,453
因为我挡在他们前面
That's because I'm in front of them.

323
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,488
大修女!
Big nun!

324
00:22:42,295 --> 00:22:44,525
我以为那是阿尔卑斯山
I thought that was an alp.

325
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,927
我的高中时代并不如意
High school wasn't my favorite time.

326
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:49,294
我爱高中
I loved high school.

327
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:53,302
四年的舞会,约会和做爱
It was four years of parties, dating and sex and

328
00:22:53,506 --> 00:22:56,907
我和400个男孩上的住宿学校
Well, I went to boarding school with 400 boys.

329
00:22:57,176 --> 00:23:01,476
每次做爱都是一次生活方式的重大抉择
Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.

330
00:23:03,316 --> 00:23:06,581
天啊,那不是回到史前时代?
Doesn't it seem like a million years ago?

331
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:13,782
我的屁股醒了
My butt cheek is waking up!
