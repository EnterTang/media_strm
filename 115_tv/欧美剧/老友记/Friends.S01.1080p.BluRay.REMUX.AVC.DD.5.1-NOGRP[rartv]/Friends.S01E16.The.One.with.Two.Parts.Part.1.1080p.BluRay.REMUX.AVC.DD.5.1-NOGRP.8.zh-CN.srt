1
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,430
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Let's go, bud.

2
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,740
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Yeah. Wow. 

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,800
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Wow, nice. 

4
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,010
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}made by PeneloPe^0^just for fun

5
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,920
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Follow me. 

6
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:36,890
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Low-level evasive maneuvers. Come on, bud. 

7
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,870
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}When you're riding a dragon, communication is key. 

8
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,940
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}You almost have to read each other's minds. 

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,600
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Or else. 

10
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,470
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Hey! What are you doing? 

11
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,580
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Are you trying to kill me? 

12
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,140
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}We gotta go back. 

13
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,550
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}I think you missed a branch. 

14
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,690
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Got it. 

15
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,950
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}And you have to have an open mind, 

16
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:08,690
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}because sometimes, your dragon knows better than you. 

17
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,330
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Stormfly, up! 

18
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,130
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Aaaah. 

19
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,570
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}You were right, Stormfly. It was down. 

20
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,400
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Oh! I almost died. 

21
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,970
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Almost died? I would have died. 

22
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,170
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Bleh. - That's a good look for you. 

23
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,540
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Hey, has anyone seen Fishlegs? 

24
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,650
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}I saw him yesterday. Does that count? 

25
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:41,790
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Whoa. There you are, Fishlegs. Are you okay? 

26
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,020
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}I'm fine. Just hanging out. 

27
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,160
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}It's not like I crashed, or anything. 

28
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,230
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Okay, I crashed. There, I said it. 

29
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,170
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Oops. - And there goes my dignity. 

30
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,780
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Yeah, you're pretty stuck. 

31
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,840
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Think I know how to get you down, uh, 

32
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,780
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}but you have to stay perfectly still. 

33
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,620
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Why? What are you gonna do? 

34
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,020
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}careful, bud, he`s not wearing any pants. 

35
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,620
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Huh? Wait a second. 

36
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,560
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}What does my lack of pants have to do...

37
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,890
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Oooh! 

38
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,730
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Thank you. 

39
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,370
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}I believe those are mine. 

40
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,170
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Now, what are we gonna do about Meat...

41
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,970
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}lug? 

42
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,040
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Can you not tell the others that Meatlug broke the trees? 

43
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,180
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}She's sensitive about her weight. 

44
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,640
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}How did this happen? 

45
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,980
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}I don't know, I was just flying along, 

46
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,480
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}taking notes on the flora and the fauna...

47
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,050
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}typical guy stuff...

48
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,920
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}then something weird jumped out of the bushes. 

49
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,090
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}It was like a...like a flaming squirrel. 

50
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,260
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Really? A flaming squirrel? Or a chipmunk. 

51
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,100
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Or some other flammable rodent. 

52
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,570
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}I don't know, Hiccup. It scared us. Isn't that enough for you? 

53
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:05,040
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Did you hear that? A flaming squirrel. 

54
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,040
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Everyone knows there's no such thing as a...

55
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,810
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}flaming squirrel! 

56
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,150
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Whoa! You saw that, right? 

57
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,230
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Hey, little guy. Who are you? 

58
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:31,170
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Ooh, settle down, big fella. 

59
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,500
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Never seen anything like it. 

60
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,650
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}You're not helping. 

61
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,050
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}You know, I think we may have discovered a new species here. 

62
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,220
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Whoa! Hey, Toothless. 

63
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,280
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}What has gotten into you? 

64
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,750
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Looks like he's hurt. 

65
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,620
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Don't be afraid. I'm a friend. 

66
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,920
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Here. 

67
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,860
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}It's okay. It's just a little dragon nip. 

68
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,200
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Hey, come on. Play nice. 

69
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,740
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Ah! 

70
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,900
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Little dragon, big claws. 

71
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,440
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Come on, let's go. We'll fix you right up. 

72
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:17,980
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}This is so exciting! It's a whole new species. 

73
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,150
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Doesn't look like a flaming squirrel to me. 

74
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,150
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}We have no idea what it's capable of. 

75
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,860
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}There's no telling what it might do. - Flame. Do it. 

76
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,790
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Ah! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! 

77
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,960
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Ah! 

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,160
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Ah! Ah! 

79
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,900
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Hey, that is funny. 

80
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,700
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Come on, you guys, this is serious. 

81
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,000
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}We have to figure out what to do with him. He's hurt. 

82
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,340
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}He's hurt? - He's just really scared. 

83
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,810
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}He'll settle down. - Um, new species, remember? 

84
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,040
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}We actually don't know what he'll do. 

85
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,110
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Well, somebody's got to take him home. 

86
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,690
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Well, big guy, here's your somebody. 

87
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,190
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}No, no, no. 

88
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:07,260
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}He's not staying here. I've got a one dragon limit. 

89
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,070
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Oh, come on, he's not a very big dragon. 

90
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,340
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Think of him more like a flaming squirrel. 

91
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,770
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Don't want one of those either. 

92
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,910
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Toothless, what are you waiting for? 

93
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,850
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Ah, looks like you got torched. 

94
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,260
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Oh, that's his name, by the way: Torch. 

95
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,960
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}So he can stay? 

96
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:34,660
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Well, can't throw him out now, I just named him. 

97
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,900
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Okay. 100 for you, and one for you. 

98
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,800
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}There you go, boys. Your first supper together. 

99
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,180
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Whoa, Toothless. 

100
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,820
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}You're sure hungry tonight, aren't you, bud? 

101
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,430
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Okay, Torch. 

102
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,960
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}This is where you're gonna sleep. 

103
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,400
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Aw, look at that. He's made himself at home. 

104
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,250
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Toothless, you don't mind sharing your bed for the night, do you? 

105
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,880
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Hope he sleeps through the night. He hardly ate. 

106
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,480
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}And, you, go to sleep. 

107
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,100
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}All right, Torch. Let's figure out what you are. 

108
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,740
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Oh, this is so exciting! 

109
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,740
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Documenting a whole new species, learning all about it. 

110
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,240
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Wait, learning? - No, thanks. 

111
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,380
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}There's nothing in the Book of dragons that looks anything like him. 

112
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,710
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}We even get todetermine what it's called. 

113
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,050
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Huh, that is...that is a really big responsibility. 

114
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,720
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}I don't know if I'm ready for that. 

115
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,760
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}I am, I'm gonna name the snot out of it. 

116
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,120
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}20 inches for the wings. - That's a big wingspan. 

117
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:32,030
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}"Big wing"! "Big span"? "Big wingspan"! 

118
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,360
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}May I have the honor of administering the claw test? 

119
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,040
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Look at these talons. They're razor-like. 

120
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:45,470
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}"Sharp claw"! "Razor feet"! "Razor sharp claw talon feet"! 

121
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,040
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Hold on. Is he serious? 

122
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,050
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}You know what's next, don't you? - No, not really. 

123
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,920
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Only the single most important test to determine a dragon's reaction to eels...

124
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,020
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}The eel reaction test. 

125
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,330
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}He ate it! He ate the eel! 

126
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:14,070
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}"Eel eater"! Come on, that's perfect. 

127
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,810
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Fishlegs, has there ever been a dragon who wasn't afraid of...

128
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,410
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Never in recorded history. 

129
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,510
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}We're in uncharted waters, my friend. 

130
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,380
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}You hear that, Torch? You're one of a kind. 

131
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,120
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}- Now we need to get it to fly. - Maybe if Torch saw Toothless fly. 

132
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:35,060
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Toothless! Let's take a ride, bud. 

133
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:37,990
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Toothless! 

134
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:41,400
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}So much for the dragon trainer. 

135
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:44,000
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}We've got this. 

136
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,840
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Watch and learn. 

137
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,500
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Hookfang! 

138
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,440
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Aah! 

139
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,880
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Oooh! 

140
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,590
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Aah! 

141
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,990
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Whoa. 

142
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,090
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Okay, your turn. 

143
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,930
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}But don't think you have to live up to that. 

144
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,500
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}What's he doing? - I think something's wrong. 

145
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:23,900
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Oh, man, we broke him! - Maybe he can't fly. 

146
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:38,190
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Oh, my dear! 

147
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:48,160
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}You are one incredible little dragon. 

148
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,160
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Whoa. Look at that burn mark. 

149
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,600
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Huh, and look at this burn mark. 

150
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,670
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Did you see how it flew? It spun like...like a typhoon. 

151
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:59,270
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}And he came back just like a boomerang. 

152
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,580
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}"Hot spinner. ""Flaming come-backer. "

153
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,080
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}No. 

154
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:05,050
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}"Typhoomerang. "

155
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,680
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}"Typhoomerang"? Nah, I don't get it. 

156
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,960
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Okay, Torch, hold still. 

157
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,400
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}I'm trying to draw you. You're getting your own chapter. 

158
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,240
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Rowr! 

159
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,170
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Rowr! Rowr! 

160
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,010
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Rowr! 

161
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,410
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Rowr! Rowr! Rowr! 

162
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:49,060
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Toothless, look what you did. 

163
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:51,190
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}And now I've got to get more charcoal. 

164
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:54,430
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Toothless, you behave yourself while I'm gone. 

165
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:01,170
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Hey, it's okay, big guy. I'll be right back. 

166
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,260
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Toothless! 

167
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,230
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}What...what is going on here? 

168
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:35,730
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Toothless, why did you do this? What is wrong with you? 

169
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,340
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Toothless, wait! 

170
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:47,410
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}It's okay, big guy. He's starting to worry me too. 

171
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,600
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}It's weird. It's like Toothless is jealous. 

172
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:49,440
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Which is great, so...my first girlfriend is a dragon. 

173
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,410
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Another thing we have in common. 

174
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:55,520
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Something must be going on under the surface. 

175
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,780
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Dragons are complex creatures, Hiccup. 

176
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,620
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}They operate on many emotional levels. 

177
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,860
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Me? I've only got the one. 

178
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,660
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Whoa, okay, Toothless! 

179
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,670
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}You see, this is what I've been talking about. 

180
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,270
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Toothless, settle down. 

181
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,580
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Gobber, grab him! 

182
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,480
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}You want to dance, big boy? 

183
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:27,510
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}'Cause I've got my dancing shoe on. 

184
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,120
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Gotcha! Whoa, whoa! 

185
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,590
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Oh! 

186
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:43,160
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}My panpipes! Now I can get the band back together. 

187
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,260
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Toothless! 

188
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,800
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Back down. 

189
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:57,380
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Not helping. - Sorry. 

190
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,410
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}I don't know what's gotten into you, but I don't like it. 

191
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:06,420
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}What? 

192
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,520
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Whoa! Whoa! 

193
00:15:11,962 --> 00:15:16,700
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Toothless! The cove is this way. 

194
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,460
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Where are you going? 

195
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,830
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}No! You're going to the cove. 

196
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,880
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}yeah, you've got to stay here. 

197
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:40,550
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}I never thought bringing Torch home would lead to this. 

198
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:43,190
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}I've got to separate you two until I can figure this out. 

199
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:50,230
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Toothless, this is serious. You've got to stay here. 

200
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:56,630
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Okay. A crazy, out-of-control dragon blocking my way out. 

201
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,800
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Huh! Or not. 

202
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,670
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}You did the right thing with Toothless. 

203
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:19,970
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}He'll snap out of it. 

204
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:24,440
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Yeah, but what if he doesn't? Then you won't have a dragon to ride, 

205
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,880
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}and if you don't have a dragon to ride, 

206
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:29,980
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}then you can't be the leader of the Dragon Academy! 

207
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,620
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Ha! - Yeah. Then I'd take over. 

208
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:33,990
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Do you really want that? 

209
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,060
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}You guys would not believe what we just saw. 

210
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,860
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Excuse me, we're having a power struggle. 

211
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:42,430
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}We're not having a power struggle. 

212
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,530
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}The whole forest. Ultimate destruction. 

213
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:49,640
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}It was beautiful. The whole thing was torched. 

214
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,870
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Torched? 

215
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,710
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Show me. 

216
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,730
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Like we said, ultimate destruction. 

217
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,500
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}We've seen that burn mark before. - Not this big. 

218
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,470
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}You know what this means? Big burn mark...

219
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,200
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Big Typhoomerang. 

220
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,070
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}He looks really mad. 

221
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:31,180
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Uh, it's not a he. It's a she. 

222
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:36,950
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}That's Torch's mother. - Torch is a baby. 

223
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,650
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}That's what Toothless was trying to tell me. 

224
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:43,490
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Whoever gets between that mother and this baby

225
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,860
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}is gonna get fried! 

226
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,260
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}You take it. I don't want it. 

227
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:48,860
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Just leave it, and let's get out of here. 

228
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,950
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Oh-oh. 

229
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,540
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Now, uh, go home to your mama. 

230
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,950
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Run! 

231
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,820
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}You guys go that way. I'll lead her back into the forest, 

232
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,720
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}away from the village. - Hiccup! 

233
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:20,730
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Oh, please stop following me. 

234
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:33,770
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Toothless! 

235
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,940
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Thanks, bud. 

236
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,180
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}I'm so sorry. I should've listened to you. 

237
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,650
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Toothless, evasive maneuvers. 

238
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:55,130
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Oh, why won't she stop? 

239
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,030
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Torch? What are you doing? 

240
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:01,820
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}You need to be with your mother. 

241
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,060
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Toothless, we have to try something else. 

242
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:07,960
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}We'll use her size against her. 

243
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,500
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Toothless, up. 

244
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:14,130
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Now dive! 

245
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,410
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}I hope she's okay. 

246
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:46,800
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Good job, bud. Everybody's back where they belong. 

247
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,810
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Good-bye, Torch. 

248
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:06,090
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Let's go home, Toothless. 

249
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:20,140
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Ah, I wrote this just for the occasion. 

250
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,400
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}I should have known

251
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,410
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}you were just trying to protect me. 

252
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,110
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}That's what you do. 

253
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:40,960
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Communication between dragon and rider goes both ways. 

254
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:43,890
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Not only must the dragon follow the rider's lead, 

255
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:47,590
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}but the rider must listen to the dragon as well. 

256
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:53,170
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}Because sometimes what the dragon is trying to say

257
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,970
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}is what you really need to hear. 

258
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:03,320
{\fncronos Pro Subhead\fs20\1c&H00FFFF&\b0}made by PeneloPe^0^just for fun
