3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,006

拜托,你得再接再厉

7
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:29,791
你和瑞秋的事没指望 你前妻是个女同志
The Rachel thing isn't happening, your ex-wife's a lesbian....

8
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:32,258
我们不想有第三回
I don't think we need a third.

9
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:35,525
抱歉,能给我们个蛋吗?整颗蛋?
Could we get an egg, still in the shell?

10
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:36,824
蛋?
An egg?

11
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:41,906
对,你拿这颗蛋去还她
Go up to her and say, "I'm returning your egg."

12
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:44,842
我们赢定了
I think it's winning.

13
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:48,174
-拜托,这太离谱了 -她会喜欢的
-It's insane. -She'll love it.

14
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:52,642
-谢谢 -谢谢,给
-Thank you. -Thank you. Here.

15
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,546
朋友,带着蛋去
Go with the egg, my friend.

16
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:01,191
快去
Go, go, go!

17
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:06,461
-你想会成功吗? -才怪,这简直是自杀.带蛋的男人
-Think it'll work? -No way. It's suicide.

-罗杰明天要带她出去 -不,菲比难道你忘了为何抛弃他?
-Roger wants to take her out. -No! Remember why you dumped him?

22
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,857
因为他惹人厌
Because he was creepy.

23
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,994
卑鄙又可怖
And mean. And frightening.

24
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:13,599
但情人节有人共渡也不差
Still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!

25
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,860
其他任何一夜跟他约会都无所谓
You can go out with a creep any night.

26
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,334
我知道我会这么做

00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:39,019
-我知道,但她朋友好像是个… -可怜虫,我知道
-But her friend sounds like a -Pathetic mess. I know, but....

31
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,321
但她是如此渴望如此脆弱
Come on. She's needy, vulnerable.

32
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,259
我想.
I'm thinking....

33
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:50,765

我的样子如何?
How do I look?

38
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,324
不关我的事
I don't care.

She's checking her coat.

46
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:51,995
我去洗掉手上的出租车味
I'm gonna wash the cab smell off of my hands.

00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:56,532
你帮我和珍妮丝点萄葡酒和红酒
Get me a white zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.

48
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,104
珍妮丝…
Janice?

49
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:06,141
珍妮丝…

我得逃了,我要从窗子爬出去
Okay, I'm making a break for it!

55
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:30,496
我一直梦想与萝拉妮约会
I've been waiting for, like, forever to go out with Lorraine.

56
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,933
-冷静点.. -冷静?
-Just calm down. -Calm down?

57
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:37,576
你竟撮合我与在五个月内 被我甩掉两次的女人
You set me up with a woman I've dumped twice in the last five months!

58
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:42,675
别这么大声行吗?你害我紧张得…
Can you stop yelling? You're making me nervous and....

59
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:47,879
我一紧张就尿不出来
I can't go when I'm nervous.

60
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,681
抱歉,你说得对

拜托!快点
Come on! Do it, do it!

62
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:02,865
罗杰虽讨人厌 但与彼得卡尼相较还差得远呢
Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete.

63
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,060
-谁? -爱哭鬼彼德
-Who? -Pete the Weeper.

64
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:09,105
我们每次做爱他就哭
The guy that used to cry every time we had sex?

65
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,938
你满足吗?
"Was it good for you?"

66
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:18,279
我每天都想为霍尔那个家伙哭
I'd take crying any day over Howard, the "I win" guy!

67
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,419
“我赢!我赢!”
"I win! I win!"

68
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:25,789
我和他约会两个月一次都没赢过
We went out for two months. I didn't win once.

69
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:29,450
我们怎会和这些浑蛋在一起?
How do we end up with these jerks?

70
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,495
我们可是良家妇女
We're some kind of magnets.

71
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:36,635
我知道我有 所以我不能戴电子表
I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.

No. 不
No.

75
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,878
我那剃光头的朋友
I have this friend who shaves her head.

76
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:55,020
她说想要停止与恶男交往的恶性循环

77

78
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:04,654
菲比,她是个大秃头

79
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:06,788
是的

80
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,793
我们明晚可以试试看

明天情人节是绝佳的时刻
It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect.

82
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,702
什么仪式?
Okay, what kind of ritual?

83
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:19,368
我们可以烧掉他们送的东西
We can burn the stuff they gave us.

84
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,313
或者是?
Or...?

85
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:27,577
或是念经,拿着权杖裸体跳舞
Or we can chant and dance around naked with sticks.

86
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,624
还是烧东西好
Burning's good.

87
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,759
知道吗
You know...

88
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:47,429
我从儿时就能用脚趾夹起25美分

89
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,371
是吗?真厉害
Yeah? Good for you.

90
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:56,340
硬币还是纸币?
Quarters or rolls of quarters?

91
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:05,813
对了,钱德我把照片上的你都剪掉了
By the way, I cut you out of all of my pictures.

92
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:10,894
如果需要,我有一袋你的头
So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.

93
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,826
不用了
That's okay.

94
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:16,895
你可以用它们做傀儡
You could make little puppets out of them.

95
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:21,665
也可以在你的“残酷戏院”中用它们!
And you could use them in your Theater of Cruelty!

96
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:28,143
-不能这么做 -什么?不能做什么?
-We can't do that! -What? What can't you do?

97
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:34,978
能过去和你谈谈吗?
Can I talk to you for a second? Over there?

98
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:43,755
我们得先离开
We might be leaving now.

99
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,955
告诉我“我们”是指你和我
Tell me it's you and me "we."

100
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:51,193
她说她要在我身上涂满东西 然后舔乾净
She wants to slather my body with stuff and lick it off.

101
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:54,430
我甚至不知道涂是什么意思
I'm not even sure what slathering is!

102
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,076
但我绝对不想错过任何部分!
But I definitely want to be a part of it!

103
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:02,375
你不能这样待我
Okay, you cannot do this to me.

104
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:05,080
你说得对,抱歉

我走了
I'm out of here.

107
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:17,254
这是我的信用卡,这一顿算我的
Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me.

108
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:20,261
我希望把她扔在你身上

109

谢谢
Thanks.

110
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:28,302
只剩下我们
-So.... -Just us.

111
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,972
真是糟糕的一夜
What a crappy night!

112
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,835
但我还是一直欣赏
I have enjoyed the fact...

113
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:38,483
你拉链里的衣服
...that your shirt's been sticking out of your zipper.

114
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:46,247
抱歉

115

00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:58,495
他们是我们最要好的朋友?
So do we have the best friends, or what?

117
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:02,835
乔伊哪儿称得上是朋友,他…
Joey's not a friend. He's...

118
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:07,502
他这留下信用卡的笨蛋
...a stupid man who left us his credit card.

119
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,514
想再来一杯?甜点?大银幕电视?
Another drink? Dessert? A big-screen TV?

120
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:14,778

That's right, each. And a rob roy.

123
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,134
我老早就想品尝了
I've always wanted to know.

124
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,683

125
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:03,701
我现在就开始想念你了

-Can you believe this happened? -No, no!

127

139
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,644
很好,乔伊回来了
Good. Joey's home.

140
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,254
这真是太好玩了
This is so much fun!

141
00:10:57,423 --> 00:11:01,291
好像是大团圆一样
This is like a reunion in the hall!

142
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:06,724
罗斯,对,跟某人打个招呼吧
Ross, there's someone I want you to say hi to.

143
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,500
他恰好打电话来
He happened to call.

144
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:14,504
罗斯,对,是我.你怎么会知道?
Hi, Ross. That's right, it's me! How did you know?

145
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:33,486
我是说会如果狗也有时差问题
So, if dogs experience jet lag...

146
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:38,026
因为狗的七年等于人的一年
... because of the seven dog years to one human year thing...

147
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:41,563
那么狗从纽约飞到洛杉矶
...when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles...

148
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:46,737
损失的不是三小时,而是十天
... he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses a week and a half.

149
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:52,333
真好笑
That's funny!

150
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:02,451
他们应该马上就做饭了
They should be cooking the food soon.

151
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,145
oh,好的
Oh, good.

152
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,531
她们是谁?
Who are they?

153
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:21,196
金发的是我前妻,碰她的是她的
The blond is my ex-wife. The woman touching her is her...

154
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:24,701
密友
...close, personal friend.

155
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:31,343
-你是指她们是情人? -如果你硬要这么说的话
-They're lovers? -lf you want to put a label on it.

156
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:37,452
-我还需要知道什么? -不,就这些了
-Anything else I should know? -Nope. That's it.

157
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,856
对了,她怀了我的孩子
Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby.

158
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:48,424
我总是忘了这件事
I always forget that part.

159
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:51,125

我只有牛至叶和佛瑞斯加
All I had is oregano and a Fresca.

162
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,983
那样也行
That's okay!

163
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:17,593
现在我们需要正义男子的精液
Now we need the semen of a righteous man.

164
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:27,762
菲比,如果我们有 现在就无需进行仪式了
If we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.

165
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:32,535
-可以丢东西了吗? -可以了
-Can we start throwing things in? -Yeah, okay!

169
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:52,688
-这是史考帝的裸体照片 -让我看看!
-A picture of Scotty Jared naked! -Let me see!

170
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:56,265
-他穿着毛衣 -没有
-He's wearing a sweater. -No.

171
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,109
-这是谁的MCl卡? -我的.咻!
-Whose MCl card is that? -Mine. Shoot!

172

Wait, isn't it almost pure

175
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,560
我怎能在情人节甩掉她
How can I dump this woman on Valentine's Day?

176
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:28,393
天晓得,但你在新年甩掉她
I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.

177
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:33,270
下辈子我要当马桶刷
In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.

178
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,041
有趣的情人
Hello, funny valentine!

179
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,735
珍妮丝
Hi, just Janice.

180
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:43,882
乔伊,我们的小媒婆
Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker.

181
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,349
我忍不住想吻你
I could just kiss you all over, and I'm gonna.

182
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:56,227
如果你不敢,就让我来开口
If you don't do it, I will.

183
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:20,510
-你真的从纽约来的? -本来不是,我从
-So are you actually from New York? -Not originally. I'm from

184
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:24,782
-你说他们可以自己做 -我以为他们可以
-You said they'd shoot it without you. -I thought they could.

185
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:30,930
最大版都是小菜一碟 最小版当然是更简单一些了啊
The maxi-pads were a piece of cake. Mini-pads should be that much easier.

186
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:35,056
-但现在是情人节 我知道,但这是我的工作
-It's Valentine's Day. -I know, but it's my job.

187
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:38,397
我会尽量赶回来,抱歉
I'll try to get back as soon as I can.

188
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:41,765
但我大部分时间都在教科学
I'm spending most of my time teaching science...

189
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:46,741
真好笑,我又不是主修科学
...which is funny because that wasn't even my major.

190
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,950
真好笑
Now, that is funny!

191
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:08,532
我邀卡萝过来会很奇怪吗?
Do you think it would be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us?

192
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:14,264
因为她现在一个人,怀孕了,心情又不好
Because she's alone now. And pregnant. And sad.

193
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:18,433
-大概吧 -你确定?卡萝!
-I guess. -Are you sure? Carol!

194
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:21,444
-愿意过来坐吗? -不,我没事
-Wanna join us? -No, I'm fine.

195
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,946
来吧,这些人会挪过去的
Come on. These people will scooch down.

00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:53,576
克莉丝汀…
IKristen does something...

202
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:57,310
最好笑的是
...that, funnily enough...

203
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:01,278
是她的工作不是她的主修
...wasn't even her major!

204
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:07,716
-谢谢你们能来 -没关系.这是我们的工作
-Thanks for coming over. -Not at all. It's pretty much our job.

205
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:10,691
这就是我们为什么戴这么酷的帽子啊
That's why we get the cool hats.

206
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:15,334
-里面有什么东西? 一些真丝四角内裤

烧焦的照片

这家伙的体毛比队长的还浓密
That guy's hairier than the chief!

210
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:31,515
这件事说来好笑
It's a really funny story how this happened.

211
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:37,053
我拿出垃圾桶,菲比点燃熏香
I was taking out the trash, and Phoebe was burning incense

212
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,588
没关系.你们不用解释
It's all right.

213
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:43,854
这不是第一件烧毁男友物品失控的事件了
This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire we've seen get out of control.

214
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,930
-这已是今晚的第三件 -真的?
-Third one tonight. -Really?

215
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:51,297
情人节之夜是我们最忙的时刻
Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.

216
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:56,639
下一次烧你们前男友的东西时:
Next time you're burning your ex-boyfriend's stuff:

217
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:59,743
第一,在一个通风好的地方
One, do it in a well-ventilated area.

第二,如果你们要烧衣服,小心合成纤维的
Two, if you wanna burn his clothing, stay away from synthetic fabrics.

Three, try to let go of the anger, and learn to love yourself.

224
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:40,646
嗨,珍妮丝…
Hey, Janice.

225
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:44,720
我不该告诉你
There's no way to tell you this.

226
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,381
至少没有别的方法来告诉你
At least, there's no new way.

227
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:54,659
我觉得我们不会结果
I just don't think things are gonna work out.

228
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:59,630
无所谓
That's fine.

229
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,971
It is? 是吗?
It is?

230
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:08,135
因为我知道我们还没结束
Because I know that this isn't the end.

231
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:11,239
事实上已经结束了
You see, actually, it is.

232
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:14,250
不,还没因为你不会让它发生的
No, because you won't let that happen.

233
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,284
难道你还不懂?
Don't you know it yet?

234
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:20,892
你爱我,钱德.宾
You love me, Chandler Bing!

235
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:25,689
不,我不爱
Oh, no, I don't.

236
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:30,859
那么就扪心自问,我们为何总是会复合? 新年是谁邀谁?
Why do we keep ending up together? New Year's, who invited who?

237
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:35,097
-情人节是谁邀谁上床? -是我,可是…
-Valentine's, who asked who into bed? -I did, but

238
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:36,901
我是你寻找的对象
You seek me out!

239
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:42,071
你的内心深处不断呼喊着我
Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn!

240
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:46,081
珍妮丝…珍妮丝…
Janice! Janice!

241
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:50,413
你推开我,你拉回我!
You push me away, you pull me back!

242
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:53,383
你要我,你需要我
You want me. You need me.

243
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:58,495
你不能没有我.你知道
You can't live without me. And you know it.

244
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:04,336
你只是不知道你知道罢了
You just don't know you know it.

245
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,534
明白吗?
See?

246
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:17,909
打电话给我
Call me!

247
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:28,618
这不是真的.我没说你妈是狼人
It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.

248
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:32,160
你有,我发誓
You did so, I swear to

249
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:38,363
她上洗手间多久了?
How long has she been in the bathroom?

250
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:41,802
我想她不是去上洗手间,她的外套不见了
She isn't in the bathroom. Her coat's gone.

251
00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:45,638
或许是太冷吧
Well, maybe it's cold in there.

252
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:49,676
或许我搞砸了九年来的第一次约会
I screwed up my first date in nine years.

253
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:53,545
-有可能 -天哪
-That could be it. -Oh, God.

254
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:57,622
知道吗,这里还是很热
You know, this is still pretty hot.

255
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:03,091
磨菇
Mushroom.

256
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:05,455
微笑
Smile.

257
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:10,193
不会每次都这样的 还是有些女人会把晚餐吃完的
They won't all be like this. Some might stay through dinner.

258
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:13,600
-抱歉,不好笑 -只是
-I'm sorry. That's not funny. -It's just....

259
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:17,367
人们老说要继续你的人生
You know the whole "get on with your life" thing?

260
00:21:17,577 --> 00:21:19,875
我必须吗?
Well, do I have to?

261
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:24,914
我和这位美女坐在这儿
I'm sitting here with this cute woman...

262
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:28,245
她是那么好
...and she's perfectly nice, but that...

263
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,591
但就这么吹了
...that's it.

264
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:37,729
我现在又和你聊天,轻松又自在
Then I'm here talking to you, and it's easy and it's fun.

265
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:40,431
我何必…
And I don't have to....

266
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:43,324
-我懂 -你懂?
-I know. -You know?

267
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:49,667
我有个疯狂的念头
Here's a wacky thought.

268
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:53,573
我们再试一次好吗?
Let's say you and I give it another shot.

269
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:57,273
我知道你要说你是个女同志
I know what you're gonna say. You're a lesbian.

270
00:21:58,351 --> 00:22:03,254
但何不暂时将它摆在一旁
But what do you say we just put that aside for now.

271
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:06,118
完全不去想它
Let's just stick a pin in it.

272
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:12,231
因为我们在一起很开心 这不容你否认
Because we're great together. You can't deny it.

273
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:16,534
我有一个适合你的戒指
I've got a ring at home that fits you.

274
00:22:16,736 --> 00:22:21,571
我有无数我俩一起的照片
I've got lots of pictures with both of us in them.

275
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:25,972
最美妙的地方是,你怀着我的孩子
And best of all, you're carrying my baby.

276
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:28,875
-这样不是很完美吗? -罗斯
-I mean, how perfect is that? -Ross

277
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:34,714
虽然你一直回绝, 但我仍然想对你说,我爱你
You keep saying that, but there's something right here. I love you.

278
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:44,462
我也爱你
I love you too.

279
00:22:44,931 --> 00:22:47,331
-但是 -不要但是
-But -No "but."

280
00:22:48,568 --> 00:22:53,596
你要知道,暂时拦置一旁的事
You know that thing we put over here with the pin in it?

281
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:59,075
迟早会浮现的
It's time to take the pin out.

282
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:07,752
你会找到对象的,合适的女人正在等着你
You'll find someone. The right woman is waiting for you.

283
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:12,480
你说得倒是轻松,你已找到合适的女人
It's easy for you to say. You found one already.

284
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:17,455
你只需找到爱男人的女人即可
All you need is a woman who likes men, and you'll be set.

285
00:23:20,466 --> 00:23:23,401
不是她
Not her.

286
00:23:34,347 --> 00:23:38,443
你们真的从一个柱子上滑下去?
So, you guys really slide down a pole?

287
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,947
-绝对的 -太酷了
-Absolutely. -That's so cool.

288
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:48,150
那你们怎么回上面的呢?
How do you get back up?

289
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:54,692
我们很少需要像着火一样急的往上去
Well, we rarely have to return from a fire as quickly.

290
00:23:57,737 --> 00:24:00,365
你们这些小伙…
So, would you guys....

291
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:05,442
你们愿意,有时,可能…
Would you like to, sometime, maybe....

292
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:07,613
有时一起出去喝一杯
Go for a drink sometime?

293
00:24:07,814 --> 00:24:09,179
当然,听起来不错
Sure, sounds good.

294
00:24:09,382 --> 00:24:12,715
我们午夜下班之后,来找你们可以吗?
We get off at midnight. We'll pick you up then.

295
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:14,580
好啊,太好了
Okay. Great!

296
00:24:15,555 --> 00:24:19,286
你们会开消防车过来吗?
So will you bring the truck?

297
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:23,220
还会让你们拉警铃
I'll even let you ring the bell.

298
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:27,229
再见了…晚安,再见…
-We'll see you later. -Bye! See you later!

299
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:29,731
天啊
Oh, my God!

300
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:33,634
看到没有?清理仪式奏效了
See? There you go. The cleansing worked.

301
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,900
没错,他们是好男人
You're right. They're nice guys!

302
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:40,944
他们是消防队员
They're firemen guys!

303
00:24:41,113 --> 00:24:45,482
-你们有告诉她们你们已婚吗? -当然没有,连我女友都不知道
-Tell them you're married? -No. My girlfriend doesn't even know.
