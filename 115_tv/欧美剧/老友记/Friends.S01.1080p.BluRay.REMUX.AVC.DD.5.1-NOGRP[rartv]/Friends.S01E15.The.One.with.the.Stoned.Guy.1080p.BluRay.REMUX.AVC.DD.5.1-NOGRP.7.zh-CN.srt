我能说这件衣服真好看吗?

科斯特.力克先生希望你在下班后 能到他办公室去
Mr. Costilick would like you to stop by his office today.

13
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,690
如果他是为搞笑备忘录 不是我干的,
If it's about those prank memos,I wasn't involved.

14
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,830
和我完全没有关系.真的.
Nothing at all. Really.

15
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:50,960
弗兰克,办公室里没有地方容纳这些恶作剧.
And frankly,those shenanigans have no place in an office environment.

16
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,510
各位,
Hey,you guys!

17

钱德说他有天大的好消息

18
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,290
所以他来的时候我们就……
So when he gets here,let's all act,like,you know

19
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,780
不管了,这一定很有意思.
Never mind. But it was gonna be really good.

20
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,160
到底怎么了…
What's going on?

21
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,090
今天和平常没什么两样
So it's a typical day at work...

22
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:19,270
然后艾尔叫我到他办公室 说他要我当电脑处理的主管
...and Big Al tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.

23
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,630

00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,070
所以我就辞职不干了

25
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,940
为什么?

26
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,270
为什么?因为这只是暂时的工作

27
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,370
钱德,你已在公司五年了
Chandler,you've been there for five years.

28
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,810
我知道,但接受升职 不就承认这就是我的目的
I know,but if I took it,I'd be admitting that this is what I do.

29
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:41,080
这是不是意味着我们必须开始自己购买卫生纸？
Does that mean we have to start buying our own toilet paper?

30
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,750
那是有大照片的乔伊，丹?
That was Joey Tribbiani with the big picture. Dan?

31
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,760
那不是能赚更多钱?
Was it more money?

32
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,520
我不在乎,我不想成为 坐在办公室到午夜
Doesn't matter. I just don't want to be a guy who sits in his office...

33
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,720
担心"WEENUS"的人
...worrying about the WENUS.

34
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,570
"WENUS"?
The "WENUS"?

00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,670
"每周估计净值使用系统" 这是电脑处理的术语
Weekly estimated net usage system. It's a processing term.

36
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,310
哦，那个"WENUS"啊
Oh,that WENUS.

37
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,110
你有何打算?
What will you do?

38
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,650
我也不知道该怎么办 我只知道我不会再待在那儿工作了
I don't know. But I won't figure it out working there.

39
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,080
我有一份你可以做的工作
I have something you can do!

40
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,620

他开了一家餐厅
Anyway,he's opening up a restaurant...

42
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,600
他正在寻找总厨师

43
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,200
-你好 -你好.
-Hi,there. -Hi.

44
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,900
我知道你是个厨师,而且我先想到你
I know. You're a chef and I thought of you first.

45
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:36,770
但钱德目前没有工作所以...
But Chandler's the one who needs a job right now,so....

46
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,310
我没有太多厨师的经验
I just don't have a lot of chef-ing experience.

47
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,610
除非那是一家只卖烤面包片的餐厅
Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.

48
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,450
他想要什么菜色?
What is he looking for?

49
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,890
他想要菜色丰富多变
He wants to do something eclectic.

50
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:54,650
因此他在找一个能创造出整个菜单的人
He's looking for someone who can create the entire menu.

51
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,690
意下如何?
So,what do you think?

52
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,670
谢了.我大概没资格戴白色大帽吧
Thanks. I just don't see myself in a big,white hat.

53
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,470
莫妮卡,知道吗?
Oh,Monica! Guess what?

54

一个完美的助跑,然后就自然而然出现了,完美的

你就知道为什么变革仅仅是理论上的事情了.

他告诉我未来餐厅的位置
He showed me where the restaurant's gonna be.

71
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,080
就在第十街不太大也不太小,大小适中
It's not too big or too small. It's just right.

告诉你,那猴子是魅力十足

I had a grape about five hours ago,so I better split this with you.

它本来就应该那么小 这是餐前开胃菜
It's supposed to be small. It's a pre-appetizer.

119
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,980
法国人称它为“阿姆兹布许”
The French call it an amuse-bouche.

126
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:28,590
当然我考虑过你.但...
Of course I thought of you. But....

But it's just this night has to go just perfect,you know?

129

温蒂的经验丰富,是个职业服务生
Wendy's more of a professional waitress.

130
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:50,010
我应该继续保持业余的姿态 将来才能在奥运会上当服务生
And I'm maintaining my amateur status so I can waitress in the Olympics.

131
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:57,620
我不想自吹自擂 但我在76年的因斯布鲁克当过服务生
I don't mean to brag,but I waited tables at lnnsbruck in '76.

132
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,620
带回家一块铜牌.
Took home a bronze.

133
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,590
阿姆兹-布许?
Amuse-bouche?

134
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,120
和我说话
Talk to me.

135
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,300
早上我坐地铁时 发生了一件诡异的事
A weird thing happened on the train this morning

136
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,470
说猥亵的话
Talk dirty.

137
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,740
-这里? -对.
-Here? -Come on. Come on.

138
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:46,540
说点火辣的
Say something hot.

139
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:51,090
什么?什么?
What? What?

140
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,760
外阴.
Vulva.

141
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,080
外阴?
Vulva?

142
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:18,610
我当时好害怕,她吓了我一跳
I panicked,all right? She took me by surprise.

143
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,720
但并未完全失去自我.我们以爱抚收场
But it wasn't a total loss. We ended up cuddling.

144
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,480
爱抚?几次?
You cuddled? How many times?

145
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,420
闭嘴,那种感觉好好
Shut up. It was nice.

146
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:32,690
我不是那种讲猥亵话的人
I don't think I'm a dirty-talking kind of guy.

147
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:37,630
你只要说出你想对她如何 或是你想她对你如何
Just say what you wanna do to her. Or what you want her to do to you.

148
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,200
或是别人想对彼此如何
Or what other people might be doing to each other.

149
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,640
这样吧,对我说吧
I'll tell you what. Try something on me.

150
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,770
开什么玩笑
Please be kidding.

151
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,410
有何不可,
Why not?

152
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,050
只要闭上眼睛告诉我 现在你想干什么
Just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.

153
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,460
好吧…我在我的住处
I'm in my apartment....

154
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,430
-然后呢? -你不在那里.
-Yeah,what else? -You're not there.

155
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:15,630
-我们在进行这样的谈话 -好的,我要开始了,准备好了吗?
-We're not having this conversation. -All right,I'll start. Ready?

156
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,470
噢,罗斯
Oh,Ross...

157
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:24,780
你让我欲火焚身,我要你舔我
...you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now.

158
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:32,580
-该你了 -我看还是算了吧
-Now you say something. -I really don't think so.

159
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:37,450
你喜欢她吧?想再见到她吗?
You like this woman,right? You wanna see her again,right?

160
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:42,000
如果你无法对我说出猥亵的话 你如何对她说呢?
If you can't talk dirty to me,how will you talk dirty to her?

161
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,760
现在告诉我你想爱抚我的屁股
Now tell me you wanna caress my butt!

162
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,910
好吧,转过去
Okay,turn around.

163
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,810
我不想你盯着我看
I don't want you staring at me.

164
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:56,710
好吧,我不看,说吧
All right,I'm not looking. Go ahead.

165
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,750
我要...
I want Okay,I want...

166
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,550
用我的双唇感觉你那光滑的皮肤
...to feel your hot,soft skin with my lips.

167
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,760
这就对了,继续
There you go. IKeep going,keep going.

168
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:22,100
我要用我的舌头…
I want to take my tongue and

169
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,770
快说啊
Say it.

170
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,580
快说
Say it!

171
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:41,980
舔遍你的全身
run it all over your body...

172
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,590
直到你颤抖…
... until you're trembling with

173
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,640
然后呢?
With?

174
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:12,050
-真好笑 -你不会相信的
-Funny story. -You're not gonna believe this.

175
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:16,460
我一向赞成你们两个小子交往
I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.

176
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,860
-颤抖那一段不错 -闭嘴!
-The trembling thing was nice. -Shut up!

177
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,130
你睡觉时以前的公司又打电话来
That guy from your old job called again.

178
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,600
-又打来? -一遍又一遍.
-Again? -And again and again and again.

179
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,440
又打来了
And again.

180
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,380
嘿，科斯特林克先生,15楼的情况如何?
Hey,Mr. Costilick. How's life on the 1 5th floor?

181
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,480
我也想念你.
Yeah,I miss you too.

182
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:48,060
对,偷自己家里的笔不够刺激
It's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home.

183
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,750
你真慷慨,但这不是钱的问题
That's very generous. But this isn't about the money.

184
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:58,490
我需要的不只是一份工作 我要的是我真正想要的
I need more than a job. I need something I really care ab

185
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,900
这是你稍早提过的年终红利之外的津贴?
That's on top of the year-end bonus?

186
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,440
你的梦想…
Your dream!

187
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:07,110
艾尔,我不是在故意为难你
Look,Al,I'm not playing hardball here,okay?

188
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:11,270
这不是交涉,这叫拒绝
This is not a negotiation. This is a rejection!

189
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,070
不,别再讲数字了
Stop saying numbers!

190
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:17,690
告诉你,你看错人了，你看错人了
I'm telling you,you've got the wrong guy!

191
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,480
星期一见
I'll see you Monday!

192
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:38,940
好大,比小格子大多了
Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle.

193
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,300
这是一个格间!
This is a cube!

194
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,840
看这里.
Look at this.

195
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:49,820
你有窗户!
You have a window!

196
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,220
没错,还有美丽的风…
Yes,indeed-y. With a beautiful view of

197
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:56,360
看,有人在小便
Look! That guy's peeing!

198
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,530
风景看够了,看这个
That's enough of the view. Check this out.

199
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,100
坐下
Okay,sit down here.

200
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,630
这个最酷,
This is great.

201
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:08,230
-准备好没? -好了
-You ready? -Yeah.

202
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,970
海伦,能进来一下吗?
Helen,could you come in here?

203
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,950
谢谢你,海伦,没事了
Thank you,Helen. That'll be all.

204
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:23,550
最后一次了,我保证
Last time I do that. I promise.

205
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:32,600
-她看起来不怎么热情 -我知道.她没有个性.
-She doesn't seem very warm. -I know. She has no personality.

206
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,430
温蒂,不要这样对我.
Wendy,don't do this to me.

207
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:44,200
我们约好的.你答应过我
We had a deal. Yeah,you promised.

208
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:55,550
-那是谁? -叛徒温蒂
-Who was that? -Wendy bailed.

209
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,620
我没服务生了
I have no waitress.

210
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,730
真是太糟糕了.再见
That's too bad. Bye-bye.

211
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,560
一小时十元!一小时十二元!
Ten dollars an hour! Twelve dollars an hour!

212
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:12,400
我希望可以 但我已经计划好去走走
I wish I could,but I've made plans to walk around.

213
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,730
你逃婚之后我一直关心你
When you ran out on your wedding,I was there.

214
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:19,910
我让你有地方住 如果这样对你仍毫无意义…
I put a roof over your head! If that means nothing....

215
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:23,050
一小时二十元
Twenty dollars an hour.

216
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,310
成交
Done.

217
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:35,350
欢迎光临莫妮卡家 我能帮你拿外套吗?
Hello. Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?

218
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,350
（喜剧演员 强・洛维兹）
Jon Lovitz

219
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,430
-史提夫 -莫妮卡
-Hi,Steve. -Hello,Monica.

220
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,930

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,500
-她叫瑞秋 -好的,

222
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,130
味道好香
Everything smells so delicious.

223
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,640
我早已忘记这种美味的…
I can't remember ever smelling such a delicious combination of

224
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,110
香味
Okay,smells.

225
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:02,110
-这房子真漂亮 -谢谢,想参观一下吗?
-It's a lovely apartment. -Thank you. Would you like a tour?

226
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,480
我只是客套一下,但,好吧
I was just being polite,but all right.

227
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:11,060
-怎么了? -他坐计程车来时
-What's up? -ln the cab on the way over...

228
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,660
燃了一根草
...Steve blazed up a doobie.

229
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,400
什么?
What?

230
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:21,010
抽了一根大麻… 好了,我懂
Smoked a joint,you know? Lit a bone. Weed,hemp,ganja

231
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,410
我和你在一起,切奇（《大麻》的主演）
I'm with you,Cheech.

232
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:31,010
-你认为他会冷静吗? -这里很干燥吗?
-Do you think he's gonna be cool? -ls it dry in here?

233
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,750
我来为你倒杯酒
Let me get you some wine.

234
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:39,460
我们可以上第一道菜了
I think we're ready for our first course too.

235
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:46,390
这些是石虾小方饺
These are rock shrimp ravioli in a cilantro ponzu sauce...

236
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:49,360
芫萎调味酱加上一点点…
...with just a touch of minced...

237
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,070
碎姜
...ginger.

238
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,710
打我屁股叫我朱蒂
Well,smack my ass and call me Judy!

239
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:06,780
-真是太好吃了 -我真高兴你喜欢
-These are fantastic! -Gosh! I'm so glad you liked them.

240
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:10,510
喜欢?我可以吃下上百个
Like them? I could eat 100 of them!

241
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,750
只有这一些
That's all there is of these...

242
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:18,330
但再过8分半钟 我们就会献上美味的洋葱馅饼
...but in a few minutes,we'll serve some tartlets.

243
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,560
馅饼...
"Tartlets"?

244
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,530
馅饼...
"Tartlets."

245
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,130
馅饼...
"Tartlets."

246
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,740
文字都已失去意义
Word has lost all meaning.

247
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:38,050
请问需要任何帮忙吗?
Excuse me. Can I help you with anything?

248
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,980
你看,我也不知道自己在找什么
You know,I don't know what I'm looking for.

249
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,370
酷,墨西哥馅饼
Cool! Taco shells!

250
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:04,840
这个就像是玉米卷
They're like a little corn envelope,you know?

251
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,910
-你不该影响食欲. -糖
-You don't wanna spoil your appetite. -Hey,Sugar-O's!

252
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:13,580
再等6分钟半
You know,if you just wait another 6 1 /2 minutes

253
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:17,410
干酪通心面!我们要做这个
Macaroni and cheese! We gotta make this!

254
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:25,390
-不,我们不做 -哦,好吧.
-No,we don't. -Oh,okay.

255
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,860
抱歉
Sorry.

256
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,570
我们何不坐这儿
Why don't you just have a seat here?

257
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:43,780
-小熊软糖给我 -不
-Give me the gummy bears. -No.

258
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,840
-把他给我 -好吧,分你一半
-Give them to me. -We'll share.

259
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:51,550
-小熊给我 -你不能全部抢走
-No. Give me the bears. -You can't have any.

260
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,920
这样不值得!
It's not worth it!

261
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,990
小熊落水了,他们快淹死了
Bears overboard! They're drowning!

262
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,300
不要站在那里.打9-1-1.
Don't just stand there. Call 9-1 -1.

263
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,990
嗨,伙计们,抓住糖逃命啊!
Hey,fellas,grab onto a Sugar-O! Save yourselves!

264
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:11,180
救命啊....我淹水了
Help! Help,I'm drowning!

265
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:15,240
-我受够了,晚餐结束 -什么?为什么?
-That's it! Dinner is over! -What! Why?

266
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:20,150
为什么?试想一下我到你的办公室然后开始...?
Why? What if I came into your office and I started...?

267
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,380
我想不出一个合适的例子.
I can't think of an example.

268
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:26,050
这机会我已等了七年
I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this...

269
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:29,890
而你却等不了四分半钟之后 再吃洋葱馅饼
...and you can't wait 4 1/2 minutes for a tartlet?

270
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:41,440
所以我跟他说,"对不起.这就是我的感受."
So I told him,"I'm sorry. That's how I feel."

271
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,440
他居然说我声音太刺耳搞得他耳朵嗡嗡叫
And he told me I harsh-ed his buzz.

272
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:50,310
然后我说,"别吃这个,这是厨房磁铁"
Then I said,"Don't eat that. It's a kitchen magnet."

273
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:56,450
结果他不听,我们只好把他留在急救室了.
And he didn't listen,so we left him in the emergency room.

274
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,060
-莫妮卡，很遗憾 -真是个王八蛋
-Mon,I'm sorry. -What a tool.

275
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:06,320
-你做的很对 -你不会想为那种人工作的
-You did the right thing. -You don't wanna work for that guy.

276
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:09,330
我以为我的机会来了
I just thought that this was it.

277
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:15,630
-不要担心.你是个了不起的厨师 -那些赞美的声音我不是装的
-Don't worry. You're an amazing chef. -Those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.

278
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,280
我能拿到全部三小时工资吗?
Am I gonna get paid for the full three hours?

279
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,040
只是一个问题而已.我们以后再说.
Just a question. We'll talk about it later.

280
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,380
和希莉亚的状况如何?
So,how did it go with Celia?

281
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:35,050
-简直是不可思议 -干得好,罗斯!
-I was unbelievable. -All right,Ross!

282
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,920
我就像是詹姆斯米切纳（历史学家）一样满口猥亵的话
I was the James Michener of dirty talk.

283
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:40,860
天下最具巧思的猥亵话
It was the most elaborate filth ever heard.

284
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:46,330
有人物,剧情,主题
I mean,there were characters,plot lines,themes,a motif.

285
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:49,300
其中一段的主角是村夫与村姑
At one point,there were villagers.

286
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,410
然后呢?
And?

287
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:57,180
猥亵话讲完后已经很晚了
By the time we finished all the dirty talk...

288
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,910
而且我们也已精疲力竭所以…
...it was late and we were exhausted

289
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,820
-你们爱抚? -那种感觉好好
-You cuddled. -Yeah,which was nice.

290
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:06,920
你们想看晚场电影吗?
Do you guys want to try to catch a late movie?

291
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:10,820
-或许吧,但我们不是该等钱德? -他到底跑哪儿去了?
-Shouldn't we wait for Chandler? -Where the hell is he?

292
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,200
我知道现在几点
I know what time it is...

293
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:17,130
但我看着WENUS而且我相当不高兴
...but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!

294
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,740
真的?告诉你吧
Let me tell you something.

295
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:25,170
你会在乎是因为我在乎,明白了吗?很好!
You will care about it because I care about it. Got it? Good!

296
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,790
这样如何?
How's this?

297
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:44,290
不好意思,这边呢?
Sorry. How about over here?

298
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:46,290
这就说明有效果了.
That means it's working.

299
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,620
-痛不痛? -不痛.
-Does this hurt? -No.

300
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:51,090
这样呢?
How about this?

301
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,900
爽啦!
There you go!

302
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:02,710
我快吐了!
I'm gonna throw up!
