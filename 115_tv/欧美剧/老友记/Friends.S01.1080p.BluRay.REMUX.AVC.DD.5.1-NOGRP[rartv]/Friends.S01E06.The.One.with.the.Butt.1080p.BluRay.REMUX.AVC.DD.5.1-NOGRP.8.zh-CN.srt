1
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:07,799
Oh, look! There's Joey's picture!

2
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,259
This is so exciting!

3
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:12,554
You can spot someone who's
never seen his plays.

4
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:16,225
Notice, no fear.
No sense of impending doom.

5
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:22,147
"The role of man number three
will not be played by Vic Shapiro. "

6
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:24,650
We came on the wrong night.

7
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,487
I can't believe I forgot a magazine.

8
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,698
-Come on, this might be good.
-I don't know.

9
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:36,745
The exclamation point scares me.
It's not just Freud, it's Freud!

10
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:39,790
Magic is about to happen!

11
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:42,376
Well, Eva...

12
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:46,255
...we've done
some excellent work here.

13
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:49,258
And I would have to say...

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,512
...your problem is quite clear.

15
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:58,600
All you want is a dinkle

16
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:01,812
What you envy's a schwang

17
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,440
A thing through which you can tinkle

18
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:08,277
To play with or simply let hang

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,252
The One With the Butt

20
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:24,895
I feel violated.

21
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,899
Did anybody else feel like
peeling their skin off...

22
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:31,568
...to have something else to do?

23
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:32,778
Ross, 1 0:00.

24
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:34,738
Is it? It feels like 2.

25
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:39,660
-No, 1 0:00!
-What?

26
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:44,164
There's a beautiful woman
at 8, 9, 1 0:00!

27
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,084
Hello!

28
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:52,965
She's amazing! She makes the women l
dream about look like fat, bald men.

29
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,092
Go over.
She's not with anyone.

30
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:58,720
And what would my opening line be?
Excuse me....

31
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,725
Come on, she's a person.
You can do it.

32
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:06,895
Could she be more out of my league?
Back me up.

33
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:10,607
He couldn't get a woman
like that in a million years.

34
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:15,904
You always see these beautiful
women with "nothing" guys.

35
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,657
You could be one of those guys.

36
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,951
-You could do that.
-You think?

37
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:22,536
Absolutely!

38
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,080
I can't believe
I'm considering this.

39
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:27,791
-l' m very aware of my tongue.
-Come on.

40
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,835
Here goes.

41
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,213
Stand back, everyone.
Incoming ego shrapnel.

42
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:35,924
All right, I can do this.

43
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,763
-Yes?
-Hi.

44
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:45,309
Okay, next word would be...

45
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:46,602
... Chandler.

46
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:50,439
Chandler is my name and....

47
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:52,733
Hi!

48
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:55,485
Yes, you said that.

49
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:58,655
Yes! Yes, I did.
But what I didn't say....

50
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,949
What I wanted to say was...

51
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:04,912
...would you like to go out with me?
Thank you. Good night.

52
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,288
Chandler?

53
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:13,128
-I didn't know you could dance!
-You were in a play!

54
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:15,255
What'd you think?

55
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:18,884
-I didn't know you could dance!
-You were in a play!

56
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,678
It wasn't that bad.
I was the lead.

57
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:26,141
It was better than the troll thing.
At least you got to see my head.

58
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,519
-You're right.
-We saw your head.

59
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:31,021
How about that accent?

60
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:35,984
Yeah. All of your W's were V's.

61
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:38,904
She said yes!

62
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:44,201
Awful play, man!

63
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:48,914
Her name's Aurora. She's ltalian
and she pronounces my name " Chandler. "

64
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,167
I like that better.

65
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:54,127
The usher gave me this.

66
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,506
-What is it?
-The Estelle Leonard T alent Agency.

67
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,467
An agency left its card.
They wanna sign me!

68
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:02,219
Based on this play?

69
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,431
Based on this play!

70
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,809
Look! There's a note on the back.

71
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:12,563
"Loved your work. Call me a sap. "

72
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,942
She was obviously very moved!

73
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,653
You should call her fairly quickly.

74
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:22,406
Yeah! As soon as possible!

75
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:27,160
Come in!

76
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,747
Hi. I'm here to see Estelle Leonard.

77
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:34,418
Just a moment, let me see
if she's in.

78
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:37,254
Hello.

79
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,674
-You' re Estelle?
-I know...

80
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:45,345
...you weren't expecting someone
so fantastically beautiful.

81
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,728
Love lump. T ake a load off already,
darling. Sit already.

82
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:56,273
I can't tell you how excited
I am to be here.

83
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,400
Why not?

84
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:03,739
-What I meant was
-You don't mind if I eat, do you?

85
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:09,995
Joey...

86
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:13,415
...sweetheart, let me ask you
a question.

87
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:17,252
Did you ever see the movie
Sleepless in Seattle?

88
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:20,756
-Wow! Do you represent those actors?
-No.

89
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:24,676
But you know the end,
where they' re happy?

90
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,513
That's gonna be you and me.

91
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:30,349
You mean you wanna sign me?

92
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:35,896
No, I wanna go to the top of the
Empire State Building and make out.

93
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:38,815
Of course I wanna sign you!

94
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:42,027
-Miss Leonard, I'm so
-Oh, boy.

95
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:45,072
-Ride them, cowboy.
-l' m sorry!

96
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:58,293
I don't see it!

97
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:03,048
-T ry to look through it.
-Unfocus your eyes.

98
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:05,801
Focus? There's nothing to focus on.

99
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,930
-It's the Statue of Liberty!
-Right!

100
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,016
-Where's the Statue of Liberty?
-There.

101
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:14,977
I can't not see it now.

102
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,021
Hey, kids!

103
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,607
Come here. Do you see anything here?

104
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:24,194
-lt looks like a boat.
-A boat.

105
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:27,281
Right in front of
the Statue of Liberty.

106
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:33,662
It's been seven seconds, and you
haven't asked me how my date went.

107
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:36,165
How was your date, Chandler?

108
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:37,666
It was unbelievable!

109
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:41,503
I've never met anyone like her.
She's had an amazing life!

110
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:43,505
She was in the Israeli army.

111
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:48,260
None of the bullets hit the engine,
so we made it to the border.

112
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,013
But just barely, and l....

113
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:55,309
I've been talking about myself
all night long. I'm sorry.

114
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,686
What about you? T ell me a story.

115
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,689
All right, once...

116
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:02,691
... I got on the subway.

117
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,693
And it was at night...

118
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:08,030
...and I rode it all the way
to Brooklyn.

119
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,532
Just for the hell of it.

120
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:13,660
We talked until 2:00. It was perfect.

121
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:15,704
More or less.

122
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,415
Suddenly, we realized we were
in Yemen.

123
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,375
I' m sorry, so "we" is...?

124
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,503
"We" is me and Rick.

125
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:23,670
Who's Rick?

126
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:25,214
Who's Rick?

127
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:27,424
My husband.

128
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:33,263
-Oh, so you' re divorced?
-No.

129
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:37,601
I' m sorry. So you' re widowed?
Hopefully?

130
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:40,270
No, l' m still married.

131
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:45,567
So, how would your husband feel
about you sitting here with me...

132
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:51,073
...sliding your foot so far up my leg
you can count the change in my pocket?

133
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:53,617
Don't worry.

134
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:57,538
He'd be okay with you
because he's okay with Ethan.

135
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:00,791
Ethan? There's an Ethan?

136
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:05,379
Ethan is my boyfriend.

137
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:06,755
What?

138
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,177
What kind of relationship
do you imagine us having...

139
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:15,347
...if you have a husband
and a boyfriend?

140
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:18,684
I suppose, mainly sexual.

141
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:23,272
Sorry it didn't work out.

142
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,775
What, not work out?
I'm seeing her again on Thursday.

143
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:29,611
Didn't you listen to the story?

144
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:33,323
Didn't you listen? It's twisted!

145
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,742
How could you get involved
with her?

146
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:39,830
I had trouble with it at first.
But I get the good stuff.

147
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:43,000
All the fun, all the talking,
all the sex...

148
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,044
...and none of the responsibility.

149
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,631
-This is every guy's fantasy!
-That's not true!

150
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,594
-Ross, is this your fantasy?
-No, of course not.

151
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,139
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

152
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:01,560
You'd go out with someone
going out with someone else?

153
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:04,062
-I couldn't.
-Good for you.

154
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:06,773
When l' m with a woman,
I need to know...

155
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:09,943
... I' m going out
with more people than her.

156
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:13,864
Once, I went out with a guy who
just got divorced.

157
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:17,451
It was hard. His kids liked me
better than him.

158
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:20,329
What does this have to do
with Chandler?

159
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:22,998
Nothing.

160
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:26,001
I didn't have anything
on that topic.

161
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,337
So I went another way.

162
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:33,217
You know, monogamy can be
a tricky concept.

163
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:36,386
I mean, anthropologically speaking

164
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:39,848
Fine. Now you'll never know.

165
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:41,683
We' re kidding. T ell us.

166
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:43,519
-We wanna know.
-Come on!

167
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:47,523
All right. There's a theory
put forth by Richard Leakey

168
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:01,870
Are we greeting each other
this way now? I like it.

169
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:05,165
Look! I cleaned!

170
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:07,626
I did the windows.
I did the floors.

171
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:12,840
I used all the vacuum attachments but
the round one. What's it for?

172
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:16,218
Nobody knows.
And we're not supposed to ask.

173
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:17,553
What do you think?

174
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:21,265
-It's very clean.
-Really, it looks great!

175
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:27,729
I see you moved the green ottoman.

176
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,068
How did that happen?

177
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:37,072
I don't know. It looked better there.

178
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:40,617
And it's an extra seat
around the table.

179
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,911
Yeah, it's interesting.

180
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,874
But you know what? Just for fun...

181
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:50,711
...Iet's see what it looked like
in the old spot.

182
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:53,172
Just to compare.

183
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,673
Let's see.

184
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:57,009
Well, it looks good there too.

185
00:11:57,426 --> 00:11:59,553
Let's leave it there for a while.

186
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:03,932
I can't believe you moved
the green ottoman.

187
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:08,979
Be glad you didn't fan the magazines.
She'll scratch your eyes out.

188
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:12,399
-You guys, I am not that bad!
-Yeah, you are.

189
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:17,279
Remember, I lived with you?
You were a little....

190
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:22,784
That is so unfair!

191
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:27,998
When we were kids, yours was the only
Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy.

192
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,127
Okay, so I'm responsible.
I'm organized.

193
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:34,338
But hey, I can be a kook!

194
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,634
All right, you madcap gal!

195
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:41,512
Imagine this.

196
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:45,724
The phone bill arrives,
but you don't pay it right away.

197
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:48,477
-Why not?
-Because you're a kook!

198
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:53,357
You wait until they send a notice.

199
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,484
I could do that.

200
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:59,696
Okay, then you let me
go grocery shopping

201
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:03,158
-No problem.
-I'm not done yet.

202
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,622
And I buy detergent, but it's not
the one with the easy-pour spout.

203
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:11,458
Why would someone do that?

204
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:15,045
One might wonder.

205
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:19,132
But I would be fine with that.

206
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:24,012
A glass is on the table with no
coaster. A cold drink. A hot day.

207
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:29,017
Beads of condensation are inching
closer to the wood....

208
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:30,352
Stop it!

209
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:35,357
Oh, my God!

210
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:37,734
It's true. Who am l?

211
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:40,237
Monica, you' re Mom.

212
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,705
Oh, my God!

213
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:54,084
Okay, I'll be there.

214
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,046
That was my agent.

215
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:05,929
My agent has just gotten me a job
in the new Al Pacino movie!

216
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:08,891
-That's great!
-What's the part?

217
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:13,228
Can you believe it? Pacino!
This guy's why I became an actor!

218
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:19,234
" Out of order? You' re out of order!
This whole courtroom's out of order! "

219
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:21,570
Seriously, what's the part?

220
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:25,490
"Just when I thought I was out,
they pull me back in! "

221
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:28,827
Come on. Seriously, Joey,
what's the part?

222
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,372
You' re.... What?

223
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,170
I' m his butt double, okay?

224
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:44,384
I play Al Pacino's butt.

225
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:49,765
All right? He goes into the shower,
and then...

226
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:52,100
... I' m his butt.

227
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:53,602
Oh, my God!

228
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:55,103
Come on, you guys.

229
00:14:55,354 --> 00:14:58,607
It's a real Pacino movie
and that's big!

230
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:01,485
It's terrific. You deserve this.

231
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:06,532
After years of struggling you've
cracked your way into show business.

232
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:11,620
Fine. Make jokes, I don't care.

233
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:15,332
-This is a big break for me!
-You' re right. It is.

234
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,503
So, will you invite us
to the big opening?

235
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:32,266
-I need some moisturizer.
-For what?

236
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,476
T oday's the big day!

237
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:40,399
You got any tweezers? I think
I have a rogue hair.

238
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:43,986
God. Go in the bathroom.
Use whatever you want.

239
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:46,989
Don't ever tell me what you did
in there.

240
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:48,907
Thank you.

241
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:53,495
-Joey's mom's on the phone.
-ln the bathroom.

242
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:57,249
-You don't wanna go in there!
-Come on, we' re roommates.

243
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:01,044
My eyes! My eyes!

244
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,257
I warned you.

245
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,176
Who is being loud?

246
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:09,136
Oh, that would be Monica.

247
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:13,015
Can I borrow stuff?
I wanna make Aurora breakfast.

248
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:15,017
You got the whole night?

249
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:18,228
Well, I only have 20 minutes
until Ethan, so....

250
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:20,355
Do I sense resentment?

251
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:23,692
No. No resentment. Believe me...

252
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:26,028
...it's worth it, okay?

253
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:31,033
In a relationship, you have moments
you'll remember the rest of your life.

254
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:34,536
Every single second is like that
with Aurora.

255
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:37,414
I've just wasted 35 of them
talking to you.

256
00:16:37,623 --> 00:16:40,751
So, Monica, can you
help me with the door?

257
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:44,671
The old Monica would remind you...

258
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,884
...to scrub that T eflon pan with
a plastic brush.

259
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:52,304
But l' m not gonna do that.

260
00:16:58,477 --> 00:17:03,357
Excuse me? Can they warm it up?
I' m concerned about goose bumps.

261
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:04,733
Everybody ready?

262
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:09,112
I wanna thank you
for this opportunity.

263
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:14,576
I mean, I know this is just a first
step, but I hope that someday

264
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:15,828
Lose the robe.

265
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:19,748
Right. Okay. Losing the robe!

266
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:22,626
Okay, and the robe is lost.

267
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:26,088
I would like to get this in one take.

268
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:27,673
Let's roll it.

269
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,925
Water's working.

270
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,845
And action!

271
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:35,472
And cut!

272
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:38,767
Butt guy, what are you doing?

273
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:40,477
I'm showering.

274
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:42,980
No, that was clenching.

275
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:46,900
The way I see it,
the guy's upset here, you know?

276
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:49,486
His wife's dead,
his brother's missing.

277
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:52,531
I think his butt would be angry here.

278
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:56,785
I think his butt would like
to get the shot before lunch.

279
00:17:56,994 --> 00:17:59,913
Once again, rolling.
Water working.

280
00:18:00,873 --> 00:18:02,833
And action!

281
00:18:04,168 --> 00:18:06,753
And cut! What was that?

282
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,258
I was going for quiet desperation.

283
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,845
But if you have to ask....

284
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:23,020
God, I love these fingers.

285
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,438
Thank you.

286
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:27,774
No, actually, I meant my fingers.

287
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:31,320
Look at them.
Look at how happy they are.

288
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:35,699
-Oh, my God, l' m late!
-Oh, no!

289
00:18:35,991 --> 00:18:38,869
-Don't go.
-Okay.

290
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,997
-I have to.
-Look, she's leaving.

291
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:45,125
I' m sorry. He'll be waiting for me.

292
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:49,046
-I thought you talked to Rick.
-It's not Rick.

293
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:51,632
Ethan? He gets the whole day!

294
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:54,593
No, it's Andrew.

295
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:00,766
I know there'll be moments...

296
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:04,603
...when I'll regret asking
the following question, but....

297
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:07,814
-And Andrew is?
-He's...

298
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:09,858
... new.

299
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:14,780
So you' re not completely fulfilled
by Rick, Ethan and myself?

300
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,449
No, that's not exactly what I was

301
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:19,368
Most women would kill...

302
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:21,745
...for three guys like us.

303
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,291
-So, what do you want?
-You.

304
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,169
-You have me.
-No. Just you.

305
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:33,173
-What do you mean?
-Lose the other guys.

306
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:36,760
Like, all of them?

307
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:40,264
Come on, we' re great together.
Why not?

308
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,516
Can't we have what we have now?

309
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:45,143
Why can't we talk and make love...

310
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:48,230
...without feeling obligated
to each other?

311
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:52,442
Up until tonight, I thought
that's what you wanted too.

312
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:56,822
Well, part of me wants that...

313
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:01,827
... but it's like l' m two guys.
One guy's saying, "This is great! "

314
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:03,912
But there's this other guy.

315
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:07,499
The guy who wells up
when the Grinch's heart grows...

316
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,252
...and breaks that measuring device.

317
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:15,424
He's saying, you know,
"This is too hard. Get out! "

318
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:18,635
So, which one of the guys
will you listen to?

319
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:24,516
I have to listen to both.
They don't let each other finish.

320
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:27,394
Which one?

321
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:32,316
The second guy.

322
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:34,610
I see.

323
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:41,450
Call me if you change your mind.

324
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:53,629
Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.

325
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:08,644
Look at it this way. You dumped her!

326
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:14,149
Right? I mean, this woman was
unbelievably sexy...

327
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:18,529
...and beautiful, intelligent,
unattainable.

328
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:22,074
T ell me why you did this again?

329
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:25,744
Movie star!

330
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:30,791
Wait! Aren't you the guy who plays
the butt in the new Pacino movie?

331
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:32,835
Nope.

332
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:35,712
No? What happened, big guy?

333
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:37,840
Big guy?

334
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:42,135
It felt like a "big guy" moment.

335
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,721
I got fired!

336
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:48,141
They said I acted too much with it.

337
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:51,520
I told everybody about this!

338
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:54,523
-Everybody's expecting to see me.
-lKnow what?

339
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:58,443
-No one will be able to tell.
-My mom will.

340
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:04,449
There's something so sweet
and disturbing about that.

341
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:08,662
I've done crappy plays
for six years...

342
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:12,332
...and I finally get my shot,
and I blow it!

343
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,293
Maybe this wasn't it.

344
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:19,381
I think when it's your shot,
you know it's your shot.

345
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:22,593
Did it feel like your shot?

346
00:22:23,427 --> 00:22:26,138
Hard to tell. I was naked.

347
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:30,392
I don't think this was it.
I don't think you just get one.

348
00:22:30,601 --> 00:22:34,021
I believe things are gonna happen
for you. I do.

349
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:38,108
You've got to think about
the day some kid will go:

350
00:22:38,317 --> 00:22:43,197
"l got the part!
I'm gonna be Joey T ribbiani's ass! "

351
00:22:45,324 --> 00:22:48,410
You think? That's so nice.

352
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:56,960
I' m sorry, Joey.
I' m gonna go to bed, guys.

353
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:59,421
-Good night.
-Good night.

354
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:02,216
You' re gonna leave
your shoes out here?

355
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:08,847
Really? Just casually
strewn about...

356
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:12,935
...in that reckless, haphazard manner?

357
00:23:13,268 --> 00:23:17,773
It doesn't matter.
I'll get them tomorrow. Or not!

358
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:21,151
Whenever.

359
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:26,156
She is a kook.

360
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,631
If it bothers you that much,
just go out and get the shoes.

361
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:46,134
No, don 't do this!

362
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:47,803
This is stupid!

363
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:51,640
I don 't have to prove anything.
I'm gonna get them.

364
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:54,768
But then everyone will know.

365
00:23:55,227 --> 00:23:59,690
Unless I get them, then wake up
really early and put them back.

366
00:23:59,857 --> 00:24:02,234
I need help!

367
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:09,658
-All you want is a dinkle
-Not that song!

368
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:13,871
-All you envy's a schwang
-Come on, you guys.

369
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:17,833
A thing through which you can tinkle

370
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:20,961
Or play with or simply let hang

371
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:25,841
All you want is a dinkle

372
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:29,386
What you envy's a schwang

373
00:24:29,595 --> 00:24:33,140
A thing through which you can tinkle

374
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:37,728
Or play with or simply let hang
