1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,006
Tell him.No.Tell him, tell him.Just...please tell him.Shut up!

2
00:00:05,006 --> 00:00:06,252
Tell me what?

3
00:00:06,252 --> 00:00:07,968
Look at you, you won't even look at him.

4
00:00:07,968 --> 00:00:12,101
Oh, come on tell me.I could use another reason whywomen won't look at me.

5
00:00:12,101 --> 00:00:13,212
All right, all right, all right.

6
00:00:13,212 --> 00:00:18,959
Last night, I had a dream that, uh, youand I, were...

7
00:00:18,959 --> 00:00:22,666
Doing it on this table.

8
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:27,707
Wow!Exellent dream score.

9
00:00:27,707 --> 00:00:32,232
Why, why, why would you dream that?

10
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:36,909
More importantly,was I any good?

11
00:00:36,909 --> 00:00:39,539
Well, you were pretty damn good.

12
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:44,797
Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate.

13
00:00:44,797 --> 00:00:51,376
Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.

14
00:00:51,376 --> 00:00:57,861
I love it, when we share.

15
00:00:57,861 --> 00:00:58,975
You're okay there?

16
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:02,396
I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.

17
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:05,422
I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing.

18
00:01:05,422 --> 00:01:11,000
I was very drunk and i wassomebody else's subconscious.

19
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:02,219
Hello Rachel.Get off.

20
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:03,715
Uh, uh, gimme.

21
00:02:03,715 --> 00:02:06,473
Can you see me operating a drillpress?

22
00:02:06,473 --> 00:02:12,038
I don't know. What are you wearing?

23
00:02:12,038 --> 00:02:15,003
Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?

24
00:02:15,003 --> 00:02:16,304
Just for some short-term-work.

25
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:18,846
You know, until I get back some of mymassage clients.

26
00:02:18,846 --> 00:02:21,436
Pirates again?

27
00:02:21,436 --> 00:02:24,493
No, nothing like that.

28
00:02:24,493 --> 00:02:31,498
I was just such a dummie. I taught this"massage-yourself-at-home-workshop." And they are.

29
00:02:31,498 --> 00:02:34,163
Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.

30
00:02:34,163 --> 00:02:36,913
Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.

31
00:02:36,913 --> 00:02:39,803
What I could, I could do it.What is it?

32
00:02:39,803 --> 00:02:45,683
Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks.She is having one of her boobs redused.

33
00:02:45,683 --> 00:02:47,794
It's a whole big boob story.

34
00:02:47,794 --> 00:02:49,544
I could be a secretary.

35
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:55,630
Well, you know Phoebs.I don't know if it's your kinda thing, becauseit involves a lot of being normal.

36
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,515
For a large portion of the day.

37
00:02:57,515 --> 00:03:00,774
I could do that.

38
00:03:00,774 --> 00:03:02,035
What are you playing with?

39
00:03:02,035 --> 00:03:03,477
Oh, it's my new beeper.

40
00:03:03,477 --> 00:03:06,125
What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?

41
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:11,034
Is it like for dinosaur emergencies.'Help, come quick, they're stillextinct.'

42
00:03:11,034 --> 00:03:13,158
No, it's for when Carol goes into labor.

43
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:19,926
She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.

44
00:03:19,926 --> 00:03:22,392
A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.

45
00:03:22,392 --> 00:03:23,779
All right, I'll see you guys later.

46
00:03:23,779 --> 00:03:25,145
Off to see young Ethan?

47
00:03:25,145 --> 00:03:27,437
Thank you.

48
00:03:27,437 --> 00:03:31,696
How young is young Ethan? Young?

49
00:03:31,696 --> 00:03:33,264
He's... our age.

50
00:03:33,264 --> 00:03:38,349
When we were?

51
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:40,071
Okay, he's a senior in college.

52
00:03:40,071 --> 00:03:42,949
College?Whoa!

53
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:47,472
And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?

54
00:03:47,472 --> 00:03:51,227
No, of course not.It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22.

55
00:03:51,227 --> 00:03:52,680
What?

56
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,682
Oh, I can't pass for 22?

57
00:03:54,682 --> 00:03:56,070
Well, maybe 25-26.

58
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,581
I am 26.

59
00:03:57,581 --> 00:04:01,075
There you go.

60
00:04:11,052 --> 00:04:13,338
Can you hear that?

61
00:04:13,338 --> 00:04:17,543
Yeah?

62
00:04:17,543 --> 00:04:20,141
See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.

63
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:24,820
Oh. Uh, I'm on.

64
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,316
Mr.Bing's office.

65
00:04:29,316 --> 00:04:31,703
No I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now.

66
00:04:31,703 --> 00:04:34,259
I'm not in a meeting.I'm right... Whoops.

67
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:38,407
Will he know what this is in reference to?And he has your number?

68
00:04:38,407 --> 00:04:44,097
All right, I'll see that he gets the message.Bye bye.

69
00:04:44,097 --> 00:04:46,401
What?Ross says hi.Ah!

70
00:04:46,401 --> 00:04:49,112
This is so fun.All right, what do we do now?

71
00:04:49,112 --> 00:04:52,484
Well, now, I actually have to get to work.

72
00:04:52,484 --> 00:04:57,636
Most likely.

73
00:04:57,636 --> 00:04:59,386
Okay, I'm gonna be out there.

74
00:04:59,386 --> 00:05:00,339
Okay.

75
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:01,479
All right. Bye bye.

76
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:06,398
Bye bye.

77
00:05:08,653 --> 00:05:09,707
Yes?

78
00:05:09,707 --> 00:05:15,976
Whatcha doin'?Ooh.

79
00:05:15,976 --> 00:05:18,102
Windows are clean, candels are lit.

80
00:05:18,102 --> 00:05:22,261
Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt.

81
00:05:22,261 --> 00:05:24,861
Did I turn the fish?No, cause I made lasagne.

82
00:05:24,861 --> 00:05:28,528
Am I out of control?Just a touch.

83
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:34,783
Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating thisguy since like, what his midterms?

84
00:05:34,783 --> 00:05:38,850
I mean, why all the sudden are you so...

85
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,198
Oh.

86
00:05:41,198 --> 00:05:42,970
What?

87
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:47,014
Could tonight be the Night?

88
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,625
I don't know.

89
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:53,693
Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but youknow.

90
00:05:53,693 --> 00:05:59,633
Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things.

91
00:05:59,633 --> 00:06:00,448
So, did you shave your legs?

92
00:06:00,448 --> 00:06:01,400
Yeah.

93
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,729
A-ha!

94
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:10,719
Would you let it go Ross.It was just a dream. It doesn't mean

95
00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:10,733
Oh, oh.

96
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:14,475
Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time.

97
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:18,805
All right, relax, relax.Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool.

98
00:06:18,805 --> 00:06:22,246
Yeah, hi, I was just beeped.

99
00:06:22,246 --> 00:06:25,711
No, Andr?is not here.

100
00:06:25,711 --> 00:06:29,483
Third time today.

101
00:06:29,483 --> 00:06:33,535
Yes, I'm sure No, sir. I don't perform thosekind of services.

102
00:06:33,535 --> 00:06:37,868
Services?Oh, services.

103
00:06:37,868 --> 00:06:43,831
Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO.

104
00:06:43,831 --> 00:06:48,981
Yeah, that's right. That's right,JUMBO with a U, sir.

105
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:54,659
No, belive me, you don't want me. Judging by his number, I'dbe a huge disappointment.

106
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:59,785
All rightie, bye bye.

107
00:06:59,785 --> 00:07:01,631
Hey, hey. How was the first day?

108
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:05,845
Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice.

109
00:07:05,845 --> 00:07:08,798
See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes.

110
00:07:08,798 --> 00:07:11,808
Me.

111
00:07:11,808 --> 00:07:13,702
No, I didn't tell anybody that I knew you.

112
00:07:13,702 --> 00:07:14,782
Why not?

113
00:07:14,782 --> 00:07:22,203
Oh, because, you know they don't like you.

114
00:07:22,203 --> 00:07:23,125
What?!

115
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,250
I thought you knew that.

116
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:28,291
Noho. Who doesn't they like me?

117
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:31,993
Everyone. Except for uh...

118
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:36,119
no everyone.

119
00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:37,759
What are you talking about?

120
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,104
Don't feel bad.

121
00:07:39,104 --> 00:07:43,159
You know they used to like you a lot.But then you got promoted, and, you know,

122
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:50,510
now you're like "Mr.Boss Man". You know,Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, "Boss Man Bing"

123
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,125
I can't belive it.

124
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:55,218
Yeah, yeah. They even do you.

125
00:07:55,218 --> 00:07:57,296
They do me?

126
00:07:57,296 --> 00:07:59,353
You know like uh okay...

127
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:07,446
uh... 'Could that report be any later?'

128
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:08,700
I don't sound like that.

129
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,841
Oh, oh Chandler...Oh... Yeah, you do.

130
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:22,106
'The hills were alive with the sound of music.'

131
00:08:22,106 --> 00:08:27,132
My scones.'My scones.'

132
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:32,534
Okay, I don't sound like that.That is so not true.

133
00:08:32,534 --> 00:08:40,030
That is so not... That is so not...That... Oh, shut up!

134
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:46,018
Did not.I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought thatgunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen.

135
00:08:46,018 --> 00:08:48,184
How was that possible?Well, think about it.

136
00:08:48,184 --> 00:08:55,906
It's always on the news. 'A man is being heldup, at gunpoint.' 'Tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.'

137
00:08:55,906 --> 00:09:01,334
And I just kept thinking:why does people continue to go there?

138
00:09:01,334 --> 00:09:03,325
Oh, ah.

139
00:09:03,325 --> 00:09:05,256
I should go.

140
00:09:05,256 --> 00:09:12,090
Okay.

141
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:16,775
Okay.Unless...What?

142
00:09:16,775 --> 00:09:19,751
Uh, ah.Unless you wanna stay over?

143
00:09:19,751 --> 00:09:23,522
I mean, I'm going to, so

144
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:28,622
Yeah, I'd really like that.

145
00:09:32,593 --> 00:09:37,635
Uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff,

146
00:09:37,635 --> 00:09:39,849
there is somethingyou should know.

147
00:09:39,849 --> 00:09:42,456
Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or

148
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:46,406
'I'm secretly married to a goat?'

149
00:09:46,406 --> 00:09:49,705
Well it's somewhere in between.

150
00:09:49,705 --> 00:09:55,237
You see, in a strictly technicalsense, of course,

151
00:09:55,237 --> 00:09:56,592
I'm not uh, well I, I mean I haven't ever uh...

152
00:09:56,592 --> 00:09:58,392
Ethan?Yeah?

153
00:09:58,392 --> 00:10:01,420
Are you a virgin?

154
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:07,897
Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these daysthen, yes I am.

155
00:10:07,897 --> 00:10:13,418
I uh, I've kinda been waiting for the right person.

156
00:10:13,418 --> 00:10:16,789
Really?Yeah.

157
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:25,627
You do know I was talking about you, right?

158
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:30,546
Wow!

159
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,779
You keep saying that.

160
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:35,576
You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies.

161
00:10:35,576 --> 00:10:39,925
Even when you practice it at home, man oh man,

162
00:10:39,925 --> 00:10:44,657
it is nothing like that.

163
00:10:44,657 --> 00:10:48,401
Listen, uh,

164
00:10:48,401 --> 00:10:53,821
you told me something that was really difficult for you.

165
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:57,839
And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.

166
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,762
Oh god, don't tell me, I did it wrong.

167
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,355
No-no. Nothing wrong about that.

168
00:11:04,355 --> 00:11:06,377
Oh.

169
00:11:06,377 --> 00:11:09,780
Um, okay, here it goes.

170
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:15,822
I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25

171
00:11:15,822 --> 00:11:18,952
and thirteen months.

172
00:11:18,952 --> 00:11:20,210
Huh!

173
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:27,718
But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything.I mean, whatthe hell does it matter how old we are.

174
00:11:29,176 --> 00:11:31,734
Uh, listen um,

175
00:11:31,734 --> 00:11:37,084
as long as we're telling stuff, uh, I have anotherone for you.

176
00:11:37,084 --> 00:11:41,281
I'm a little younger than I said.

177
00:11:41,281 --> 00:11:43,211
You're not a senior?

178
00:11:43,211 --> 00:11:48,585
Oh, I'm a senior...

179
00:11:48,585 --> 00:11:56,008
in High School.

180
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:01,628
Ok...ay.

181
00:12:01,628 --> 00:12:02,955
What we did was wrong.

182
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:10,412
Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn'talive during the Bicentennial.

183
00:12:10,412 --> 00:12:14,848
I just had sex.

184
00:12:14,848 --> 00:12:16,633
Ethan, focus.

185
00:12:16,633 --> 00:12:18,162
How could you not tell me?

186
00:12:18,162 --> 00:12:19,536
Well, you never told me how old you were.

187
00:12:19,536 --> 00:12:20,782
Well, that's different.

188
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:25,527
My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48states.

189
00:12:25,527 --> 00:12:27,603
What were you thinking?I wasn't thinking.

190
00:12:27,603 --> 00:12:28,589
I was too busy fallin'

191
00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:32,349
Don't say it....in love with you.

192
00:12:32,349 --> 00:12:33,805
Really?

193
00:12:33,805 --> 00:12:36,327
Sorry.

194
00:12:36,327 --> 00:12:38,402
Well,fall out of it.

195
00:12:38,402 --> 00:12:43,515
You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a schoolnight.

196
00:12:43,515 --> 00:12:57,525
Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'mJoan Collins.

197
00:12:57,525 --> 00:13:03,384

198
00:13:07,225 --> 00:13:11,584
Okay, Andr?should be there in like 45 minutes.

199
00:13:11,584 --> 00:13:12,152
All rightie,

201
00:13:19,309 --> 00:13:21,506
Oh, come on.You told me about the last dream.

202
00:13:21,506 --> 00:13:23,292
No, forget it.

203
00:13:23,292 --> 00:13:30,332
Oh, why not.Was I doing anything particularly saucy?

204
00:13:30,332 --> 00:13:36,035
All right, fine.Um, you were not the only one there.

205
00:13:36,035 --> 00:13:39,331
Joey was there too.

206
00:13:39,331 --> 00:13:42,116

207
00:13:42,116 --> 00:13:46,938

You're sure?Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?

211
00:13:57,554 --> 00:13:59,541
No, it was just the three of us.

212
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,828
Huh!

213
00:14:01,828 --> 00:14:08,353
So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you andme and Chandler?

214
00:14:08,353 --> 00:14:12,307
You know what?What?

215
00:14:12,307 --> 00:14:25,371
There were times when it wasn't even me.

216
00:14:25,371 --> 00:14:32,508
That is so sweet, you guys.

217
00:14:32,508 --> 00:14:39,886
Hey, Mon.Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?

218
00:14:39,886 --> 00:14:42,267

Are you not seeing him anymore?No.

222
00:14:48,853 --> 00:14:51,903
You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.

223
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:59,596
And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to getout of gym.

224
00:14:59,596 --> 00:15:04,441
I, I didn't say any I sw...I did not say anything, I swear. Hestopped by.

225
00:15:04,441 --> 00:15:08,409
Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one thestrongest Power Ranger is?

226
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:11,611
Oh, yeah.

227
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:14,186
Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing.

228
00:15:14,186 --> 00:15:15,048
Could we drop it now?

229
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:17,648

00:15:40,109 --> 00:15:42,379
Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people.

236
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:46,172
Work people? Nobody told me.

237
00:15:46,172 --> 00:15:53,319
No, I know.That's a part of the whole, you know,them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.

238
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:56,345
You know, I don't get this.A month ago, these people were my friends.

239
00:15:56,345 --> 00:15:59,424
You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person.

240
00:15:59,424 --> 00:16:00,846
Well, then you should come tonight.

241
00:16:00,846 --> 00:16:02,409
You know, just hang out with them.

242
00:16:02,409 --> 00:16:04,129
Let them see what a great guy you still are.

243
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,146
You think I should?

244
00:16:05,146 --> 00:16:06,526

245
00:16:06,526 --> 00:16:08,754
Okay.Okay.Okay.

246
00:16:08,754 --> 00:16:11,502
Oh, but, could we not go together?

247
00:16:11,502 --> 00:16:16,751
I,I don't wanna be the geek thatinvited the boss.

248
00:16:18,307 --> 00:16:23,539
I Think last night was great.You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and Idoing Ebony and Ivory.

249
00:16:23,539 --> 00:16:26,561
You were great.But they still made fun of you.

250
00:16:26,561 --> 00:16:27,613
What?

251
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:35,091
You know, now you're more like, you know like,"Mr. Caring Boss,""Mr.", you know, "I'm one of you, Boss,""Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!"

252
00:16:35,091 --> 00:16:38,644
Then, I don't get it.

253
00:16:38,644 --> 00:16:41,044
Well, you know what Chandler?I think you've gotta face it.

254
00:16:41,044 --> 00:16:43,887
You're like,the guy in the big office, you know.

255
00:16:43,887 --> 00:16:46,744
You're the one that hires them, that fires them

256
00:16:46,744 --> 00:16:49,062
They still say you're a great boss.

257
00:16:49,062 --> 00:16:50,837
They do?Uh huh.

258
00:16:50,837 --> 00:16:53,451
But they're not your friends anymore.

259
00:16:53,451 --> 00:16:54,604
I just wan't to...

260
00:16:54,604 --> 00:16:56,017

Oh, Carol and I have a new system.If she punches in 911, it means she'shaving a baby, otherwise I just ignore it.

265
00:17:16,123 --> 00:17:22,541
What about Andr?Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousinNathan, and frankly,

266
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:28,493
it was a little more than I needed to know.

267
00:17:29,467 --> 00:17:32,132
Hey.

268
00:17:32,132 --> 00:17:34,581
That was gonna be my opener.

269
00:17:34,581 --> 00:17:38,436
Hey, did you guyscheck out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?

270
00:17:38,436 --> 00:17:40,514
I thought that was just a rumour.True story.

271
00:17:40,514 --> 00:17:45,167
They're here already?

272
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:51,178
All right, look.I've gotta tell you something. I'm not 17. I onlysaid so that you'd think I was cute and vunerable.

273
00:17:51,178 --> 00:17:56,914
I'm actually 30, I have a wife, I havea job, I'm your Congressman.

274
00:17:56,914 --> 00:18:02,575
Monica, this is ridiculous, we're great together. We cantalk, we make each other laugh, and the sex.

275
00:18:02,575 --> 00:18:07,550
Oh, man, okay i have no frame of graft, but Ithought that was great.

276
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:12,040
It was.Then, what's the problem?

277
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,622
Ethan, it's um...

Icky?

280

You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?

281
00:18:24,023 --> 00:18:26,216
This isn't easy for me either.

282
00:18:26,216 --> 00:18:32,955
I wish things were different, I If youwere a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or

283
00:18:32,955 --> 00:18:35,391
if we lived in biblical times,I would really...

284
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,140
