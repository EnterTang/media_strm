1
00:00:02,648 --> 00:00:06,982
谢谢你煮的好料 随时都欢迎

2
00:00:02,781 --> 00:00:06,842
-Thanks for the tasty dinner. -You're welcome for a tasty dinner.

3
00:00:07,185 --> 00:00:09,085
What are you guys looking at?

4
00:00:07,953 --> 00:00:09,215
你们在看什么？

5
00:00:09,254 --> 00:00:11,654
Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.

6
00:00:09,321 --> 00:00:11,983
罗斯和宇宙无敌第一美女

7
00:00:12,024 --> 00:00:13,855
Yeah, come to Papa!

8
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,580
好骚的娘儿们

9
00:00:19,331 --> 00:00:20,696
l know!

10
00:00:19,431 --> 00:00:20,591
我知道

11
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:24,792
Probably the only time l'll say this...

12
00:00:22,935 --> 00:00:24,596
这实在不像我会说的话

13
00:00:25,003 --> 00:00:27,369
...but did you see the ass on her?

14
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,933
但你们看到她的屁股了吗？

15
00:00:27,606 --> 00:00:29,836
What did you...? When did you...?

16
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:29,832
你是…你是…

17
00:00:30,108 --> 00:00:33,009
How did you...? How did you get a girl like that?

18
00:00:30,275 --> 00:00:32,800
你怎么… 你怎么把到那种货色的？

19
00:00:34,212 --> 00:00:38,512
So what is she, like a spokesmodel? An aerobics instructor?

20
00:00:34,346 --> 00:00:38,407
她是谁，代言模特儿？ 有氧舞蹈教练？

21
00:00:38,517 --> 00:00:43,784
她是古生物学博士候选人 专攻新生代

22
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,049
Actually, she's a paleontology doctoral candidate...

23
00:00:42,254 --> 00:00:44,415
...specializing in the Cenozoic Era.

24
00:00:45,023 --> 00:00:47,253
But that's, like, the easiest era.

25
00:00:45,324 --> 00:00:47,019
不过那是最简单的时代

26
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:51,794
l've seen her at work, but l always figured....

27
00:00:49,094 --> 00:00:51,756
我在馆里见过她，但总觉得…

28
00:00:53,999 --> 00:00:56,490
But l made her dinner.

29
00:00:54,132 --> 00:00:56,362
总之我做饭给她吃

30
00:00:56,802 --> 00:01:00,203
We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow.

31
00:00:57,035 --> 00:01:00,300
我们聊得很愉快 明天还要见面

32
00:01:02,674 --> 00:01:06,804
也许她跟朋友打赌 谁能钓到最怪的怪胎

33
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:06,610
Maybe her friends are betting to see who gets the biggest geek.

34
00:01:06,845 --> 00:01:09,177
Fine by me. Hope she wins.

35
00:01:06,912 --> 00:01:08,777
我无所谓，祝她胜利

36
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,749
Hey, we should have a contest. Yeah.

37
00:01:12,217 --> 00:01:13,548
我们也应该来比

38
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,286
See who can bring home the most beautiful woman.

39
00:01:15,087 --> 00:01:17,146
看谁带回来的女生最漂亮

40
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:21,318
That's a good idea, Joe. We could call it life.

41
00:01:17,856 --> 00:01:20,188
好主意 名称就叫“真实人生”

42
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,455
本集播出：“送礼风波”

43
00:01:22,394 --> 00:01:24,385

45
00:02:09,307 --> 00:02:11,070
You have any wrapping paper?

46
00:02:09,574 --> 00:02:11,041
有包装纸吗？

47
00:02:11,376 --> 00:02:13,173
ls it for my birthday present?

48
00:02:11,843 --> 00:02:13,401
你要包我的生日礼物？

49
00:02:13,912 --> 00:02:15,880
lt was your birthday months ago.

50
00:02:14,112 --> 00:02:16,603
你生日都过了1个月

51
00:02:16,481 --> 00:02:21,214
You said you ordered something special and it just hadn't come yet.

52
00:02:16,715 --> 00:02:20,344
对，但你说订了特别的东西 还没送来

53
00:02:23,555 --> 00:02:25,113
l have a call in about that.

54
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:25,213
我有接到电话

55
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,782
制片：塔德史帝文斯

56
00:02:27,726 --> 00:02:31,526
lt's for Kathy. lt's an early copy of her favorite book.

57
00:02:27,893 --> 00:02:30,088
这是给凯西的生日礼物 是她最喜欢的书的早期版本

58
00:02:30,195 --> 00:02:32,288
编剧：史考特席维利 雪娜高柏格米恩

59
00:02:31,697 --> 00:02:34,222
The Velveteen Rabbit!

60
00:02:32,397 --> 00:02:34,365
是“天鹅绒兔宝宝”

61
00:02:34,466 --> 00:02:37,162
天哪 当男孩的爱让它变成真兔子…

62
00:02:34,499 --> 00:02:37,161
When the boy's love makes the rabbit real....

63
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:40,261
好，别摸，你的手有油污 导演：雪莉詹森

64
00:02:37,402 --> 00:02:40,769
Don't touch it because your fingers have destructive oils.

65
00:02:42,007 --> 00:02:44,908
Then you'd better keep it away from Ross' hair.

66
00:02:42,174 --> 00:02:44,108
那你最好别靠近罗斯的头发

67
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,346
This is pretty rare. How did you get that?

68
00:02:47,012 --> 00:02:49,207
这很珍贵，你是怎么找到的？

69
00:02:49,314 --> 00:02:53,250
没什么，我只是跑了几家书店 问了几个书商

70
00:02:49,581 --> 00:02:52,175
No big deal. l just went to some bookstores...

71
00:02:52,384 --> 00:02:56,753
...talked to some dealers, called some of the author's grandchildren.

72
00:02:53,351 --> 00:02:55,615
联络了几个作者的孙子

73
00:02:57,089 --> 00:02:58,613
Honey, that's so sweet.

74
00:02:57,622 --> 00:02:59,146
真是太感人了

75
00:02:58,924 --> 00:03:03,520
What a great way to say, ''l secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend.''

76
00:02:59,257 --> 00:03:02,351
完全宣告了 “室友的马子，我在暗恋你”

77
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,220
lt doesn't say that.

78
00:03:04,863 --> 00:03:07,764
哪会啊…会吗？

79
00:03:06,898 --> 00:03:07,887
Does it?

80
00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:12,799
How will it look when you get her something incredibly meaningful...

81
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,228
你自己看嘛 你送的礼物别具意义又昂贵

82
00:03:13,038 --> 00:03:17,031
...and expensive, and her boyfriend, Joey, gives her an orange?

83
00:03:13,338 --> 00:03:15,738
她的男朋友却送她一个柳橙

84
00:03:17,576 --> 00:03:20,943
l'll make sure Joey gets her something really great.

85
00:03:17,642 --> 00:03:21,134
好 我会叫乔伊送她很好的礼物

86
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:23,411
lt's got to be better than that book.

87
00:03:21,246 --> 00:03:22,838
可得比那本书还好

88
00:03:23,648 --> 00:03:24,945
像十字弓啦
Like a crossbow!

89
00:03:27,552 --> 00:03:29,144
Once again, l am sorry.

90
00:03:27,853 --> 00:03:29,411
真的很抱歉

91
00:03:29,654 --> 00:03:31,144
Thank you. Bye.

92
00:03:29,855 --> 00:03:31,083
谢谢，再见

93
00:03:32,557 --> 00:03:36,186
l had to turn down a job catering a funeral for 60 people.

94
00:03:32,691 --> 00:03:36,627
我推掉一个60人的丧礼外烩

95
00:03:36,561 --> 00:03:39,394
Oh, my God! What happened?

96
00:03:36,728 --> 00:03:39,629
天哪，出了什么事？

97
00:03:39,898 --> 00:03:41,490
Sixty guests.

98
00:03:40,098 --> 00:03:41,463
是60个“客人”

99
00:03:45,337 --> 00:03:47,168
Why'd you have to turn it down?

100
00:03:45,504 --> 00:03:47,404
你为什么要推掉？

101
00:03:47,372 --> 00:03:49,670
l don't have the money or equipment...

102
00:03:47,506 --> 00:03:51,670
因为我没有钱和用具 可以临时接这种大生意

103
00:03:49,908 --> 00:03:53,366
...to handle something that big on such short notice.

104
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,138
不可能的

105
00:03:53,578 --> 00:03:55,842
Wow, what is with all the negativity?

106
00:03:53,779 --> 00:03:56,043
这么消极是怎样？

107
00:03:56,448 --> 00:03:59,349
You sound like ''Moni-can't,'' not ''Moni-can'' !

108
00:03:56,548 --> 00:03:59,039
你好像“摩妮不可” 而不是“摩妮可”

109
00:04:01,086 --> 00:04:02,314
摩妮“卡”

110
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:02,609
Moni-ca.

111
00:04:04,222 --> 00:04:07,623
You've been playing around with this catering for years.

112
00:04:04,422 --> 00:04:07,619
你办外烩都3年多了

113
00:04:07,726 --> 00:04:10,718
你到底想不想当外烩厨师？ 我不知道

114
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:10,453
-Do you want to be a caterer? -l don't know.

115
00:04:10,695 --> 00:04:12,629
There you go! That's the spirit!

116
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:12,797
这就对了！

117
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,202
你需要钱我借你，你就接吧

118
00:04:14,266 --> 00:04:18,202
lf you need money, l will lend you money. Just get moving!

119
00:04:18,436 --> 00:04:21,872
Really? l'd need $500 for all the food and supplies.

120
00:04:18,603 --> 00:04:22,198
真的？我需要5百元来采买

121
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,702
lt's worth it if it'll get you moving. You haven't worked in months!

122
00:04:22,307 --> 00:04:26,971
好，能让你接就值得 你好几个月没工作了

123
00:04:26,912 --> 00:04:30,541
-Neither have you. -Yes, but l'm doing this.

124
00:04:27,078 --> 00:04:28,306
你也是

125
00:04:28,413 --> 00:04:29,846
但我正在资助你

126
00:04:31,149 --> 00:04:33,276
That would be great! Thank you.

127
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:32,973
太好了，谢谢

128
00:04:38,056 --> 00:04:41,890
-Can l borrow your apartment keys? -Why?

129
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,382
你家的钥匙借我

130
00:04:40,292 --> 00:04:41,020
为什么？

131
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:45,923
You can pee here.

132
00:04:44,896 --> 00:04:46,158
你可以在这里尿啊

133
00:04:50,101 --> 00:04:51,625
也对
Yes, l can, of course.

134
00:04:52,537 --> 00:04:55,597
不好意思 反正刚好鸭子也在用浴室

135
00:04:53,305 --> 00:04:56,399
lt's okay. The duck's using our bathroom anyway.

136
00:04:59,911 --> 00:05:01,936
What are you getting for her birthday?

137
00:05:00,078 --> 00:05:02,205
你要送她什么生日礼物？

138
00:05:02,214 --> 00:05:06,116
We've been dating a couple weeks. l got to get her something?

139
00:05:02,314 --> 00:05:05,010
我们才交往2星期也要送吗？

140
00:05:05,116 --> 00:05:06,140
要啊

141
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:09,220
不但要送，还要送得很好

142
00:05:06,351 --> 00:05:09,047
You have to get her something really nice.

143
00:05:10,188 --> 00:05:12,383
-l know! -And not one of your coupons...

144
00:05:10,322 --> 00:05:14,588
有了！ 1小时的乔伊猛男体验券不算

145
00:05:12,624 --> 00:05:14,353
...for an hour of ''Joey Love.''

146
00:05:20,465 --> 00:05:23,434
-A crossword! Can l help? -No.

147
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:22,690
填字游戏！我可以帮忙吗？ 不行

148
00:05:23,602 --> 00:05:25,797
Last week l got all but three answers...

149
00:05:23,702 --> 00:05:26,603
对不起 可是上星期我几乎全答对了

150
00:05:26,004 --> 00:05:28,598
...and l want to finish one without any help.

151
00:05:26,705 --> 00:05:28,866
我很想独力完成一次

152
00:05:28,907 --> 00:05:29,896
Fine.

153
00:05:28,974 --> 00:05:29,770
好

154
00:05:30,175 --> 00:05:33,906
But you can't help me develop my new universal language.

155
00:05:30,275 --> 00:05:32,800
那你也不能帮我研发新宇宙语

156
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:37,005
How'd it go?

157
00:05:36,348 --> 00:05:37,212
怎么样？

158
00:05:37,282 --> 00:05:40,274
Oh, my God! lt was the best funeral ever!

159
00:05:37,315 --> 00:05:40,216
天哪，这个葬礼太棒了

160
00:05:41,186 --> 00:05:43,086
Everyone loved the food.

161
00:05:41,253 --> 00:05:43,153
每个人都说好吃，还有

162
00:05:43,255 --> 00:05:45,086
我还接了明天的另一场葬礼

163
00:05:43,321 --> 00:05:45,789
l even got another funeral for tomorrow.

164
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,181
是今天的死者的死党

165
00:05:45,991 --> 00:05:48,186
The dead guy from today's best friend.

166
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,323
lt's like l am the official caterer for that accident.

167
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,729
我成了那场事故的指定外烩

168
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,498
Mon, l'm so happy for you!

169
00:05:52,631 --> 00:05:54,690
我真替你高兴

170
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:57,429
Thanks. Check out my new catering stuff.

171
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:57,063
谢了，你看我的新用具

172
00:05:58,003 --> 00:05:59,971
Look! l'm an omelet station!

173
00:05:58,103 --> 00:05:59,798
看，我可以去卖蛋卷

174
00:06:00,372 --> 00:06:02,169
Omelet? Made to order?

175
00:06:00,438 --> 00:06:01,871
要特制蛋卷吗？

176
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,699
l'll have one, please. Plus my money.

177
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,172
请给我一份，还有我的钱

178
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,771
l didn't realize you needed it right away.

179
00:06:08,313 --> 00:06:10,679
我不晓得你马上就要

180
00:06:11,049 --> 00:06:14,507
You told me to go and be a caterer. So l went. l be'd.

181
00:06:11,116 --> 00:06:13,744
你叫我去当外烩厨师 我就去了

182
00:06:15,754 --> 00:06:17,483
我把钱都花掉了

183
00:06:16,054 --> 00:06:17,681
l used it to buy all this stuff.

184
00:06:17,856 --> 00:06:20,120
Aborigine.

185
00:06:17,989 --> 00:06:19,217
“原住民”！

186
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,127
不对

187
00:06:24,429 --> 00:06:27,728
l got another job tomorrow, so l'll pay you back then.

188
00:06:24,562 --> 00:06:28,089
我明天还有生意 到时就能还你

189
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,368
Okay. Sorry l acted like a bank.

190
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,500
好，抱歉刚才一副银行嘴脸

191
00:06:33,338 --> 00:06:37,240
Aborigine. Oh, no, l tried that already.

192
00:06:33,438 --> 00:06:34,462
“原住民”！

193
00:06:35,006 --> 00:06:36,132
不对，刚才就…

194
00:06:50,822 --> 00:06:52,289
Would you like to come in?

195
00:06:50,989 --> 00:06:52,422
你要进来吗？

196
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:56,826
Did Homo erectus hunt with wooden tools?

197
00:06:53,124 --> 00:06:56,287
直立人是用木器打猎吗？

198
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,161
According to recent findings.

199
00:06:58,463 --> 00:06:59,760
最新证据显示是的

200
00:07:11,443 --> 00:07:13,843
Here, Mitzi! Here, Mitzi!

201
00:07:11,576 --> 00:07:13,407
蜜琪来，蜜琪来

202
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,243
Mitzi is...?

203
00:07:15,647 --> 00:07:18,514
蜜琪是… 我的仓鼠

204
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:19,246
My hamster.

205
00:07:20,085 --> 00:07:22,417
l hope she's okay. l haven't seen her in a while.

206
00:07:20,285 --> 00:07:22,253
但愿它没事，好久没见到它了

207
00:07:23,288 --> 00:07:24,482
Have a seat.

208
00:07:23,421 --> 00:07:24,388
请坐

209
00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:26,088
Where?

210
00:07:24,956 --> 00:07:26,014
（坐哪里？）

211
00:07:27,792 --> 00:07:29,623
Oh, hey. Do you....

212
00:07:28,126 --> 00:07:29,616
对了，你…

213
00:07:33,865 --> 00:07:36,834
Do you have any Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?

214
00:07:33,965 --> 00:07:37,230
你有肉桂水果烤吐司吗？

215
00:07:37,335 --> 00:07:39,200
什么？ 我有

216
00:07:37,936 --> 00:07:39,631
Well, l do.

217
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:44,400
我们回我家去，点几根蜡烛

218
00:07:41,006 --> 00:07:44,100
Let's go back to my place, light a couple candles...

219
00:07:44,342 --> 00:07:48,108
...break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties....

220
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:47,603
开一盒肉桂水果烤吐司

221
00:07:49,681 --> 00:07:52,809
-l'd rather not. -Oh, yeah? Why not?

222
00:07:49,781 --> 00:07:51,146
还是不要好了

223
00:07:51,549 --> 00:07:52,709
为什么？

224
00:07:54,285 --> 00:07:56,617
Don't take this the wrong way...

225
00:07:54,352 --> 00:07:56,252
我没有恶意

226
00:07:56,855 --> 00:08:00,291
...but your place kind of has a weird smell.

227
00:07:56,921 --> 00:08:00,379
但是你家有一股怪味

228
00:08:07,499 --> 00:08:10,559
-ls everything in the car? -Did you settle the bill?

229
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,397
东西都上车了？ 对，钱拿到了吗？

230
00:08:10,502 --> 00:08:12,834
还没，我最讨厌要钱了

231
00:08:11,536 --> 00:08:13,299
l hate this part.

232
00:08:14,572 --> 00:08:16,563
Look what we almost left!

233
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,664
差点忘了这个

234
00:08:16,775 --> 00:08:17,833
那不是我的

235
00:08:16,808 --> 00:08:18,241
That's not mine.

236
00:08:18,977 --> 00:08:21,377
Look what we almost took!

237
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,543
差点偷了这个

238
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,347
Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart?

239
00:08:28,953 --> 00:08:30,079
柏卡特太太？

240
00:08:30,855 --> 00:08:32,482
Well, we're all cleaned up.

241
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:32,613
厨房都收拾好了

242
00:08:33,758 --> 00:08:36,124
很好，谢谢你
Good. Thank you.

243
00:08:39,597 --> 00:08:43,499
And, well, there's this small matter of the....

244
00:08:39,731 --> 00:08:43,394
还有一件小事…

245
00:08:44,536 --> 00:08:46,367
-Dear? -The matter of...

246
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:48,196
什么事？ 就是…费用的事

247
00:08:47,672 --> 00:08:48,764
...payment.

248
00:08:49,908 --> 00:08:53,708
Jack used to handle the finances.

249
00:08:49,974 --> 00:08:53,205
钱都是杰克在管

250
00:09:00,452 --> 00:09:03,148
-You get it? -No, but l made a widow cry.

251
00:09:00,652 --> 00:09:03,052
拿到了吗？ 没有，但是把未亡人惹哭了

252
00:09:03,288 --> 00:09:05,620
See you in hell.

253
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:04,445
我们会被打下十八层地狱

254
00:09:12,197 --> 00:09:14,529
You know what we should all do?

255
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:16,560
你知道吗？ 我们应该去看歌舞剧

256
00:09:14,732 --> 00:09:16,859
Go see a musical.

257
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,837
Sure.

258
00:09:19,671 --> 00:09:20,865
好

259
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,539
You know which one?

260
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,135
你知道应该看哪一部？

261
00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:27,710
The 1 996 Tony Award winner.

262
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:30,174
1996年东尼奖得奖作品 那部戏一定赞

263
00:09:28,546 --> 00:09:31,276
l mean, that one's gotta be good.

264
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,981
Do you know the name of that one?

265
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,411
你知道它的名字吗？

266
00:09:34,385 --> 00:09:36,717
l don't know. Grease?

267
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:36,510
不晓得，“火爆浪子”？

268
00:09:38,356 --> 00:09:39,380
不是

269
00:09:41,659 --> 00:09:42,990
Rent?

270
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:42,657
“吉屋出租”？

271
00:09:43,428 --> 00:09:45,293
Yes! Rent!

272
00:09:43,561 --> 00:09:45,153
对！“吉屋出租”

273
00:09:46,164 --> 00:09:47,654
So when do you want to go?

274
00:09:46,331 --> 00:09:47,821
好，什么时候去？

275
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:50,390
What? l'm sorry. l can't, l'm busy.

276
00:09:47,932 --> 00:09:50,400
什么？ 我不行，我很忙

277
00:09:55,807 --> 00:09:59,106
Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.

278
00:09:55,907 --> 00:09:58,899
天哪，女孩子的礼物真难买

279
00:10:00,178 --> 00:10:01,167
Yes, it is...

280
00:10:00,545 --> 00:10:02,706
的确很难…文具店？

281
00:10:01,412 --> 00:10:03,437
...at Office Max!

282
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,073
What did you get her?

283
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,115
你买了什么？

284
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:10,080
A pen.

285
00:10:08,553 --> 00:10:09,918
一支笔

286
00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:15,526
lt's two gifts in one. lt's a pen that's also a clock.

287
00:10:11,222 --> 00:10:14,521
这是二合一，是笔，也是时钟

288
00:10:16,761 --> 00:10:19,457
-You can't give her that. -Why not?

289
00:10:17,395 --> 00:10:19,022
你不能送这个

290
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:21,030
为什么？ 她不是小孩子

291
00:10:19,764 --> 00:10:20,856
She's not 1 1 !

292
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:25,295
And it's not the seventh night of Chanukah.

293
00:10:22,734 --> 00:10:24,395
这也不是光明节结束前夕

294
00:10:27,872 --> 00:10:31,808
What he means by that is, while this is a very nice gift...

295
00:10:28,072 --> 00:10:32,099
他的意思是，这个礼物虽然好

296
00:10:32,043 --> 00:10:34,603
...maybe it's not something a boyfriend gives.

297
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,735
却不适合送给女朋友

298
00:10:34,812 --> 00:10:36,143
Sure it is.

299
00:10:34,846 --> 00:10:36,040
当然适合

300
00:10:36,381 --> 00:10:37,609
She needs a pen for work.

301
00:10:36,481 --> 00:10:37,971
她上班要用到笔

302
00:10:37,882 --> 00:10:42,444
She's writing. She turns it over. ''lt's time for my date with Joey!''

303
00:10:38,082 --> 00:10:39,709
写到一半转过来一看

304
00:10:39,817 --> 00:10:41,808
哇，该去跟乔伊约会了

305
00:10:44,489 --> 00:10:48,687
All right. What did you get for Angela Del Veccio's birthday?

306
00:10:44,622 --> 00:10:49,150
好 你送安琪拉什么生日礼物？

307
00:10:49,494 --> 00:10:51,018
She didn't have one.

308
00:10:49,627 --> 00:10:51,618
我们交往时没碰上生日

309
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:53,463
For three years?

310
00:10:51,729 --> 00:10:52,855
整整3年？

311
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,798
Look, it's too late, and l got an audition.

312
00:10:56,134 --> 00:11:00,503
已经来不及了，我还要试镜 我不能再找了

313
00:10:59,037 --> 00:11:01,028
l can't shop anymore.

314
00:11:02,674 --> 00:11:05,973
l will go out and try to find something for her.

315
00:11:02,874 --> 00:11:06,571
我去帮你找，好吗？

316
00:11:06,678 --> 00:11:08,043
谢了
Thanks, man.

317
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,173
While you're at it, could you get her a card?

318
00:11:09,047 --> 00:11:10,810
你能不能顺便买张卡片？

319
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:15,044
Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?

320
00:11:12,116 --> 00:11:14,846
要不要我顺便写一首小诗？

321
00:11:15,253 --> 00:11:19,212
Or just get a card that has a poem already in it.

322
00:11:15,386 --> 00:11:18,150
或是买张印了诗的卡片

323
00:11:20,258 --> 00:11:26,424
Oh, so it's a card, but it's also a poem-holder.

324
00:11:20,425 --> 00:11:25,419
那是一张卡片，也是一页诗

325
00:11:29,334 --> 00:11:33,464
-You have to get our money. -She couldn't stop crying.

326
00:11:29,634 --> 00:11:33,593
你得把钱要到 但是她哭个不停

327
00:11:33,638 --> 00:11:37,165
With those thick glasses, her tears look giant.

328
00:11:33,705 --> 00:11:36,265
眼泪还被眼镜放大了

329
00:11:37,575 --> 00:11:38,803
l know, it's tough.

330
00:11:37,775 --> 00:11:39,037
我知道很难

331
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:42,241
You know what the first thing l did after my mom's funeral was?

332
00:11:39,143 --> 00:11:42,601
你知道我妈一下葬我做了什么

333
00:11:42,413 --> 00:11:44,313
-What? -Pay the caterer!

334
00:11:42,714 --> 00:11:44,204
什么？ 付钱给外烩厨师

335
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,783
l've had a lot of jobs.

336
00:11:45,883 --> 00:11:47,612
我做过很多工作

337
00:11:46,985 --> 00:11:50,944
And there are some people who always try to get out of paying.

338
00:11:47,719 --> 00:11:51,211
有些人总是想赖帐

339
00:11:51,222 --> 00:11:53,884
lt's either ''That massage wasn't long enough'' ...

340
00:11:51,322 --> 00:11:53,756
不是“按摩时间不够长”

341
00:11:53,858 --> 00:11:55,689
就是“我没听过这几首歌”

342
00:11:54,092 --> 00:11:56,322
...or ''l don't know any of those songs'' ...

343
00:11:55,793 --> 00:11:59,024
或“这些墨西哥草帽不够大” “坏心眼的白妞”

344
00:11:56,527 --> 00:12:00,554
...or ''These sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!''

345
00:12:03,101 --> 00:12:04,864
So you think she's faking?

346
00:12:03,134 --> 00:12:05,159
你觉得她在装？

347
00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:08,696
There weren't any tears till you showed her the bill.

348
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:09,001
你拿出帐单前她根本没哭

349
00:12:08,906 --> 00:12:10,840
She sounded pretty upset to me.

350
00:12:09,107 --> 00:12:10,972
她听起来很难过

351
00:12:18,516 --> 00:12:20,711
She seems fine now.

352
00:12:18,616 --> 00:12:19,947
现在似乎没事了

353
00:12:25,056 --> 00:12:28,253
So you just left? Her place was really that bad?

354
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:28,456
所以你就走了？ 她家真的那么脏？

355
00:12:28,493 --> 00:12:32,088
You throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day.

356
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:32,017
我们下班回家 会把外套扔到椅子上

357
00:12:32,397 --> 00:12:36,197
Like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage.

358
00:12:32,563 --> 00:12:36,192
在她家是扔到一堆垃圾上

359
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:40,761
And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage.

360
00:12:37,835 --> 00:12:40,929
那也不是外套，而是一堆垃圾

361
00:12:42,106 --> 00:12:45,598
And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time...

362
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,800
那也不是下班回家 而是世界末日

363
00:12:44,909 --> 00:12:48,072
只有垃圾存留下来

364
00:12:45,843 --> 00:12:48,107
...and garbage is all that has survived.

365
00:12:50,515 --> 00:12:52,676
-Here. -Wow. Thanks.

366
00:12:50,715 --> 00:12:52,046
拿去 谢了

367
00:12:53,618 --> 00:12:55,085
So what happened?

368
00:12:53,818 --> 00:12:55,285
然后呢？

369
00:12:55,286 --> 00:12:57,618
Nothing. l had to get out of there.

370
00:12:55,386 --> 00:12:57,650
哪有然后，我逃之夭夭

371
00:12:57,855 --> 00:13:00,187
Next time, you take her to your place.

372
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,352
下次你就带她去你家

373
00:13:00,425 --> 00:13:03,223
l tried that. She says it has a weird smell.

374
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:03,222
我试过了，她说我家有怪味

375
00:13:04,362 --> 00:13:07,695
-What kind of smell? -l don't know. Soap?

376
00:13:04,462 --> 00:13:06,555
什么怪味？ 不晓得，香皂味？

377
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,266
-Listen, you like this girl, right? -Yeah.

378
00:13:08,733 --> 00:13:11,327
听着，你喜欢她对吧？ 对

379
00:13:11,436 --> 00:13:12,926
你想再跟她见面？ 对
-You want to see her again? -Yeah.

380
00:13:13,037 --> 00:13:14,664
那你就得在垃圾里跟她做
So you're going to have to do it in the mess!

381
00:13:16,874 --> 00:13:19,069
Yeah, okay. You're right.

382
00:13:17,008 --> 00:13:18,669
好吧，你说得对

383
00:13:19,777 --> 00:13:23,213
l mean, who cares about a little sloppiness?

384
00:13:20,011 --> 00:13:23,606
稍微乱一点又怎样？

385
00:13:24,315 --> 00:13:27,546
其实蛮可爱的 很好

386
00:13:25,383 --> 00:13:27,783
-lt's endearing, really. -All right!

387
00:13:28,052 --> 00:13:30,987
Now you go get that beautiful pig!

388
00:13:28,186 --> 00:13:29,847
去撂倒那只美丽的猪吧

389
00:13:40,832 --> 00:13:44,393
l just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present...

390
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,962
我花了一下午替凯西找一件 比这只兔子好的礼物

391
00:13:44,602 --> 00:13:47,400
...for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.

392
00:13:47,572 --> 00:13:48,561
Any luck?

393
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:48,733
有找到吗？

394
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:53,143
Yeah, l found this great place called ''lnvisible Things for Kathy.''

395
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,606
有，我找到一家店 叫“送给凯西的隐形礼物”

396
00:13:53,411 --> 00:13:56,244
Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?

397
00:13:53,544 --> 00:13:55,273
你能不能帮我搬一这些礼物？

398
00:13:56,581 --> 00:14:00,108
Just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen...

399
00:13:56,814 --> 00:14:00,648
你就把书退回去 让乔伊送她那支时钟笔

400
00:14:00,351 --> 00:14:03,081
...and you get her something worse than that...

401
00:14:00,752 --> 00:14:02,845
你送个更差的东西，例如…

402
00:14:03,321 --> 00:14:04,652
...like a regular pen.

403
00:14:03,421 --> 00:14:04,581
一支普通的笔

404
00:14:05,957 --> 00:14:08,687
She's really going to love this, you know?

405
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,717
她会很喜欢这本书

406
00:14:09,293 --> 00:14:11,921
The bottom line is, l want her to have it...

407
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,394
我希望她拥有这本书

408
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:15,497
...even if l don't get to be the one who gives it to her.

409
00:14:12,263 --> 00:14:15,323
就算不是我送的也行

410
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,700
Honey, that's so sweet.

411
00:14:16,267 --> 00:14:17,757
好感人喔

412
00:14:19,003 --> 00:14:21,130
You don't think it's just pathetic?

413
00:14:19,137 --> 00:14:20,627
你不觉得很可悲吗？

414
00:14:21,472 --> 00:14:23,201
Oh, ''pathetic'' !

415
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:22,733
是“可悲”！

416
00:14:26,811 --> 00:14:29,371
l've been looking all over for you.

417
00:14:26,944 --> 00:14:29,538
我要去见凯西了，我到处找你

418
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,879
-Where? -Our place. The hall.

419
00:14:30,014 --> 00:14:30,810
在哪里找？

420
00:14:30,915 --> 00:14:32,542
家里啦，大厅啦

421
00:14:36,621 --> 00:14:39,317
l got something for her.

422
00:14:36,788 --> 00:14:38,187
我找到礼物了

423
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:46,563
lt's a book.

424
00:14:44,729 --> 00:14:46,026
是一本书

425
00:14:47,532 --> 00:14:48,658
A book?

426
00:14:47,765 --> 00:14:48,754
书？

427
00:14:50,301 --> 00:14:52,667
ls it a book that's also a safe?

428
00:14:50,435 --> 00:14:52,460
是书也是保险盒？

429
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:56,572
它就是一本书
lt's a book that's just a book.

430
00:14:56,941 --> 00:15:00,775
是她小时候最喜欢的书 “天鹅绒兔宝宝”的珍本

431
00:14:57,141 --> 00:15:00,907
lt's the Velveteen Rabbit. lt was her favorite as a kid.

432
00:15:01,212 --> 00:15:03,737
So just let me know if she likes it, okay?

433
00:15:01,412 --> 00:15:04,210
让我知道她喜不喜欢，好吗？

434
00:15:03,981 --> 00:15:07,473
You got it. Thanks for doing this. l owe you one.

435
00:15:04,348 --> 00:15:06,942
没问题 谢谢你，我欠你一次

436
00:15:11,222 --> 00:15:14,419
There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?

437
00:15:12,023 --> 00:15:13,991
那20块没有找钱是吧？

438
00:15:15,226 --> 00:15:17,888
No, it came out to an even twenty.

439
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,655
没有，刚好20块

440
00:15:19,564 --> 00:15:22,727
Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.

441
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,198
哇，跟新书差不多贵

442
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:39,546
-You didn't get the money? -Maybe l can try at intermission?

443
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,277
还是没要到，对吧？

444
00:15:37,381 --> 00:15:38,939
等她暂停再去好了

445
00:15:40,418 --> 00:15:42,682
You know what? Let's just go.

446
00:15:40,618 --> 00:15:42,483
我们就走吧

447
00:15:42,587 --> 00:15:45,420
不行，钱没拿到不能走

448
00:15:43,221 --> 00:15:45,280
We're not leaving till we get paid!

449
00:15:45,756 --> 00:15:47,781
l don't know who she thinks she is.

450
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,090
她以为她是谁啊

451
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:50,459
l talked to the florist. She didn't get paid either.

452
00:15:48,192 --> 00:15:50,717
我问过，花店也没拿到钱

453
00:15:50,628 --> 00:15:56,225
Or the limo driver, or the priest, and he can get the dead guy damned for all eternity.

454
00:15:50,828 --> 00:15:55,094
还有灵车司机和神父 但他可以咒那个死人不得超生

455
00:15:57,268 --> 00:16:00,431
Well, l'm not going back out there.

456
00:15:57,502 --> 00:15:59,527
我不要再去了

457
00:16:00,571 --> 00:16:02,334
Fine. Enough is enough!

458
00:16:00,805 --> 00:16:02,397
好，我受够了

459
00:16:03,841 --> 00:16:05,274
Hey, widow?

460
00:16:03,975 --> 00:16:05,067
喂，未亡人

461
00:16:06,511 --> 00:16:07,535
Widow?

462
00:16:06,811 --> 00:16:07,869
死老公的

463
00:16:08,112 --> 00:16:09,602
Excuse me? Excuse me!

464
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:09,439
打扰一下

465
00:16:11,949 --> 00:16:16,249
Thanks. Clearly this is a very, very hard time for you.

466
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:16,643
谢了 你现在当然十分难过

467
00:16:16,454 --> 00:16:19,685
But we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid...

468
00:16:16,754 --> 00:16:20,417
但我们提供服务 就该领到费用

469
00:16:19,891 --> 00:16:21,791
...because you ate that service.

470
00:16:20,525 --> 00:16:21,924
因为你吃都吃了

471
00:16:22,026 --> 00:16:25,985
钱没付清我们不会走
We are not leaving here until we are paid every penny, because...

472
00:16:26,097 --> 00:16:29,430
因为我们是兼职的，不必赶场

473
00:16:26,531 --> 00:16:30,763
...we're part-time caterers and we have no place else to go.

474
00:16:32,103 --> 00:16:34,435
All right. l'll get my bag.

475
00:16:32,236 --> 00:16:35,433
好，我去拿皮包 很好

476
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:36,734
Good.

477
00:16:43,948 --> 00:16:46,280
l'm going to leave some cards here.

478
00:16:44,081 --> 00:16:45,776
我留几张名片

479
00:16:48,252 --> 00:16:51,585
Please think of us for your next event.

480
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:50,785
下次有需要请考虑我们

481
00:16:57,728 --> 00:16:59,218
So you want to come inside?

482
00:16:57,862 --> 00:16:59,762
你想进来吗？

483
00:17:00,431 --> 00:17:01,625
Yes.

484
00:17:00,565 --> 00:17:01,896
想

485
00:17:03,768 --> 00:17:05,668
Yes, l do.

486
00:17:03,935 --> 00:17:05,527
我想

487
00:17:15,346 --> 00:17:18,144
l'll be right back. Make yourself comfortable.

488
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,104
我马上回来，你随便坐

489
00:17:42,173 --> 00:17:44,539
Guess who?

490
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,604
猜猜我是谁？

491
00:17:45,676 --> 00:17:48,201
Department of Sanitation?

492
00:17:45,743 --> 00:17:47,711
卫生稽查人员？

493
00:17:49,447 --> 00:17:50,505
lt's me.

494
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,740
是我

495
00:18:05,062 --> 00:18:06,051
What?

496
00:18:05,463 --> 00:18:06,623
怎么了？

497
00:18:06,564 --> 00:18:08,156
Oh, Cheryl!

498
00:18:06,731 --> 00:18:08,323
喔！雪柔

499
00:18:13,537 --> 00:18:15,266
天哪…

500
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:33,488
那是我的仓鼠，是蜜琪

501
00:18:30,921 --> 00:18:34,357
-lt's my hamster! lt's Mitzi! -Oh, my God!

502
00:18:33,591 --> 00:18:37,425
天哪，对不起，我吓到了

503
00:18:34,592 --> 00:18:37,186
l'm so sorry. l must have freaked out.

504
00:18:37,395 --> 00:18:38,987
Thank God it's not Mitzi!

505
00:18:37,528 --> 00:18:39,291
幸好不是蜜琪

506
00:18:40,031 --> 00:18:41,293
只是一只老鼠

507
00:18:40,097 --> 00:18:41,860
lt's just a rat.

508
00:18:45,703 --> 00:18:46,897
l did it!

509
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,397
完成了

510
00:18:47,605 --> 00:18:50,597
l finished it! l did it all by myself!

511
00:18:47,738 --> 00:18:50,172
我填完了 我一个人把它填完了

512
00:18:50,808 --> 00:18:52,776
And there's nobody to hug.

513
00:18:50,908 --> 00:18:52,398
却没有人可抱

514
00:18:53,978 --> 00:18:54,967
Move!

515
00:19:01,952 --> 00:19:03,146
Hey, you guys!

516
00:19:02,353 --> 00:19:05,550
你们！ 我一个人把字谜填完了，抱我

517
00:19:03,387 --> 00:19:05,480
l finished it all by myself! Hug me.

518
00:19:06,757 --> 00:19:07,951
太棒了

519
00:19:08,392 --> 00:19:10,121
-Congratulations. -Thank you.

520
00:19:08,426 --> 00:19:09,916
恭喜 谢谢

521
00:19:10,394 --> 00:19:11,486
How did it go?

522
00:19:10,594 --> 00:19:12,892
外烩办得怎样？ 过瘾死了

523
00:19:11,729 --> 00:19:15,756
The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her till she did.

524
00:19:12,997 --> 00:19:15,966
那个寡妇不肯付钱 菲比就骂到她付钱为止

525
00:19:15,966 --> 00:19:18,127
l'm a hard-ass.

526
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:17,364
没错，我是狠角色

527
00:19:20,004 --> 00:19:23,405
And l'm a wuss. We should be partners.

528
00:19:20,137 --> 00:19:21,263
而我是软脚虾

529
00:19:22,573 --> 00:19:23,437
我们应该联手

530
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:26,066
是啊 狠角色和软脚虾打击犯罪

531
00:19:23,641 --> 00:19:26,405
Hard-ass and wuss. We could fight crime.

532
00:19:28,579 --> 00:19:30,103
Wait a minute, Phoebe.

533
00:19:28,612 --> 00:19:32,013
等一下，我们是该联手

534
00:19:30,648 --> 00:19:32,343
We should be partners.

535
00:19:32,717 --> 00:19:34,878
我们应该合伙办外烩

536
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,650
We should be catering partners.

537
00:19:34,852 --> 00:19:38,652
You're not working now, and we have a great time together.

538
00:19:34,985 --> 00:19:38,944
你想嘛，你现在没工作 我们又合作无间

539
00:19:39,056 --> 00:19:41,786
好 我下厨，你管钱

540
00:19:39,857 --> 00:19:42,121
l cook and you take care of the money.

541
00:19:41,892 --> 00:19:44,122
我就像娶了个很传统的老婆

542
00:19:42,326 --> 00:19:45,022
lt'll be like l have a wife in the '50s!

543
00:19:51,001 --> 00:19:52,593
How did she like the gift?

544
00:19:51,035 --> 00:19:52,525
怎样？她喜欢吗？

545
00:19:52,636 --> 00:19:55,935
她爱死了 她拿去隔壁给女生们看

546
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:55,771
She loved it. She's showing the girls right now.

547
00:19:56,006 --> 00:19:57,200
Yeah? That's great.

548
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,302
是吗？太好了

549
00:19:57,408 --> 00:20:02,004
老实说 占了这个功劳我很过意不去

550
00:19:57,441 --> 00:19:58,738
l got to tell you...

551
00:19:58,943 --> 00:20:01,844
...l feel bad taking credit for this, because...

552
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:05,105
...am l going to get a lot of credit for this!

553
00:20:02,113 --> 00:20:04,206
我可有得爽了

554
00:20:12,256 --> 00:20:13,951
生日快乐 谢谢
-Happy birthday. -Thank you.

555
00:20:14,358 --> 00:20:16,758
You know, Chandler got you a gift too.

556
00:20:15,893 --> 00:20:17,360
钱德也有礼物要送你

557
00:20:18,229 --> 00:20:19,560
No, he didn't.

558
00:20:18,763 --> 00:20:19,695
他没有

559
00:20:21,866 --> 00:20:25,267
Yeah, he did. Look, it's right there on the counter.

560
00:20:21,966 --> 00:20:24,366
他有，看，就在餐上

561
00:20:32,176 --> 00:20:33,666
Happy birthday.

562
00:20:32,209 --> 00:20:35,736
生日快乐…我很抱歉

563
00:20:34,678 --> 00:20:36,009
l'm sorry.

564
00:20:38,282 --> 00:20:40,147
You really didn't have to.

565
00:20:38,449 --> 00:20:40,007
你何必破费

566
00:20:42,253 --> 00:20:47,213
你以为这是一支笔 其实转过来还有时钟

567
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,689
You think it's just a pen, but you turn it over and it's also a clock.

568
00:20:49,393 --> 00:20:50,655
No, this is great!

569
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,118
好棒的礼物

570
00:20:51,395 --> 00:20:54,489
-Thank you, Chandler. -Oh, yeah.

571
00:20:51,529 --> 00:20:53,520
谢谢你，钱德 不客气

572
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,231
Want to go to bed?

573
00:20:56,567 --> 00:20:57,761
要睡觉了吗？

574
00:20:59,136 --> 00:21:01,297
l'll be in, in a minute.

575
00:20:59,303 --> 00:21:00,565
我马上就来

576
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:08,002
Don't forget your coupon.

577
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,000
别忘了带猛男体验券

578
00:21:14,218 --> 00:21:15,310
Good night.

579
00:21:14,318 --> 00:21:15,148
晚安

580
00:21:16,921 --> 00:21:19,321
Thank you for the gift.

581
00:21:17,454 --> 00:21:18,819
谢谢你的礼物

582
00:21:20,891 --> 00:21:24,520
l just knew that sometimes when you're writing...

583
00:21:21,058 --> 00:21:23,720
我只是想有时你写字时

584
00:21:23,828 --> 00:21:26,820
不一定知道确切时间

585
00:21:24,728 --> 00:21:27,492
...you don't always know the exact time.

586
00:21:28,532 --> 00:21:32,161
No, l didn't mean the pen. Thank you for the book.

587
00:21:28,732 --> 00:21:32,293
我不是说这支笔 谢谢你那本书

588
00:21:33,671 --> 00:21:34,763
The book?

589
00:21:34,205 --> 00:21:36,605
书？ “天鹅绒兔宝宝”

590
00:21:35,005 --> 00:21:36,563
The Velveteen Rabbit?

591
00:21:36,774 --> 00:21:39,675
l have a feeling you had something to do with it.

592
00:21:36,974 --> 00:21:39,169
我觉得跟你有关

593
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,104
What do you mean?

594
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,042
什么意思？

595
00:21:41,612 --> 00:21:43,705
When Joey gave it to me he said:

596
00:21:41,946 --> 00:21:43,436
乔伊送我的时候说

597
00:21:43,547 --> 00:21:46,983
“因为我知道你喜欢兔子” “也喜欢起司”

598
00:21:43,914 --> 00:21:48,442
''This is because l know you like rabbits, and l know you like cheese.''

599
00:21:51,222 --> 00:21:53,087
Thanks. l love it.

600
00:21:51,355 --> 00:21:53,220
谢谢，我好喜欢

601
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:56,259
l know how hard it must have been for you to find.

602
00:21:53,324 --> 00:21:55,292
你一定花了很多功夫

603
00:21:57,528 --> 00:22:01,555
ln case you missed that, that sound was, ''Oh, well.''

604
00:21:57,628 --> 00:22:00,392
如果你没听到 我的意思是“还好啦”

605
00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:05,598
You must really like Joey to go to all that trouble.

606
00:22:02,433 --> 00:22:05,960
你一定很喜欢乔伊 才会这么费心

607
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,303
Oh, yeah. He's my--

608
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,662
是啊，他是…

609
00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:14,539
He's my best friend.

610
00:22:12,476 --> 00:22:13,909
他是我最要好的朋友

611
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,744
-Well.... -Good night.

612
00:22:17,815 --> 00:22:18,873
晚安

613
00:22:27,992 --> 00:22:31,223
Hey, that coupon expires, you know.

614
00:22:28,225 --> 00:22:30,193
那可是限时体验券

615
00:22:41,705 --> 00:22:45,038
You don't know me. l'm Monica Geller, Ross' sister.

616
00:22:42,907 --> 00:22:45,671
你不认识我 我是摩妮卡盖勒，罗斯的妹妹

617
00:22:45,276 --> 00:22:48,541
You know, it's too bad that didn't work out.

618
00:22:46,443 --> 00:22:48,843
你好，可惜我们合不来

619
00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:51,043
Anyway, he told me about your apartment.

620
00:22:48,946 --> 00:22:51,278
总之他提到你家的情况

621
00:22:51,315 --> 00:22:54,216
Well, l couldn't sleep thinking about it.

622
00:22:51,382 --> 00:22:54,249
我想得睡不着

623
00:22:56,153 --> 00:22:59,247
我可以帮你打扫吗？
So would it be okay if l cleaned it?

624
00:23:01,792 --> 00:23:02,781
不行吗？

625
00:23:04,395 --> 00:23:06,886
l won't be able to sleep.

626
00:23:04,595 --> 00:23:06,085
我会睡不着

627
