00:00:04,516 --> 00:00:06,347
It is true what they say:

2
00:00:06,552 --> 00:00:08,315
Pregnant beIIies Iook Iike a drum.

3
00:00:12,224 --> 00:00:16,820
I'm so pregnant that
my guitar doesn't fit anymore.

4
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:19,554
So I'm going to pIay my songs
on this drum.

5
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:21,662
It sounds reaIIy cooI!

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,164
Listen, Iisten.

7
00:00:25,938 --> 00:00:29,237
Smelly cat, smelly cat

8
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:32,874
What are they feeding you?

9
00:00:38,951 --> 00:00:40,111
That sounds great!

10
00:00:40,319 --> 00:00:43,686
I know! And I've onIy
been pIaying for an hour.

11
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,557
-What are you doing here?
-I came to ask you a big favor.

12
00:00:53,565 --> 00:00:56,500
Don't teII me you want to keep
more stuff in my uterus.

13
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:01,899
Okay. Now, see.

14
00:01:02,608 --> 00:01:04,838
I want to name the girI baby LesIie.

15
00:01:05,077 --> 00:01:08,774
And Frank wants to name
one of the boy babies...

16
00:01:09,047 --> 00:01:10,674
...Frank Jr., Jr.

17
00:01:12,517 --> 00:01:13,950
WouIdn't that be Frank III?

18
00:01:14,386 --> 00:01:16,013
Don't get me started.

19
00:01:17,756 --> 00:01:20,850
Anyway, since there
are three babies...

20
00:01:21,093 --> 00:01:23,584
...and we both got
to put our names in...

21
00:01:23,795 --> 00:01:28,289
...we wouId be truIy honored
if you wouId name the other boy baby.

22
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,199
That's so nice!

23
00:01:31,803 --> 00:01:32,895
Cougar.

24
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,237
Think about it.

25
00:01:39,578 --> 00:01:41,546
The One with RacheI's New Dress

27
00:02:27,793 --> 00:02:29,761
I Ieft a bra drying in there.

28
00:02:30,028 --> 00:02:32,690
WiII your son think it's yours
and be traumatized?

29
00:02:32,864 --> 00:02:36,766
Mommy can have a wife.
Daddy can have a bra.

30
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,901
It's time to go.

31
00:02:40,105 --> 00:02:42,733
See, that cIock's a IittIe fast.

32
00:02:42,941 --> 00:02:45,239
We stiII have 1 7 minutes.

33
00:02:45,544 --> 00:02:48,342
What can we do in 1 7 minutes...

34
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,945
...twice?

35
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:53,009
WeII, that's ambitious.

36
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,251
You can ignore that.

37
00:02:56,521 --> 00:02:57,818
That's your son.

38
00:02:58,023 --> 00:03:00,992
BeIieve me, when he's oIder,
he'II understand.

39
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:04,795
I'II be right there.

40
00:03:13,305 --> 00:03:15,205
This is CaroI and Susan.

41
00:03:15,407 --> 00:03:18,467
-It's so nice to finaIIy meet you.
-You too.

42
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:23,272
-Susan wiII be in London next week.
-I've never been there.

43
00:03:23,548 --> 00:03:25,311
-I'II show you around.
-Great!

44
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:28,778
AIso, I was hoping to catch a show.
Any suggestions?

45
00:03:29,054 --> 00:03:30,919
There's tons of terrific stuff.

46
00:03:31,556 --> 00:03:33,046
I'II go with you.

47
00:03:35,627 --> 00:03:37,720
Look at you two bonding.

48
00:03:38,029 --> 00:03:39,656
Making us Iate for the airport.

49
00:03:40,499 --> 00:03:41,488
Are you aII right?

50
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,033
It's just us getting aIong
is difficuIt for him...

51
00:03:45,303 --> 00:03:47,533
...because he doesn't Iike me.

52
00:03:48,206 --> 00:03:49,696
Come on. That's....

53
00:03:49,975 --> 00:03:51,169
It's true.

54
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:03,447
How did we Iose?

55
00:04:06,091 --> 00:04:07,888
Do we have a baby name yet?

56
00:04:08,093 --> 00:04:10,391
No. It's so hard!

57
00:04:10,695 --> 00:04:12,959
I went through this book
and found nothing.

58
00:04:13,198 --> 00:04:16,634
I want a name that's
reaIIy strong and confident.

59
00:04:16,935 --> 00:04:18,926
You know? Like...Exxon!

60
00:04:21,106 --> 00:04:23,734
It certainIy worked
for that VaIdez kid.

61
00:04:25,143 --> 00:04:28,806
You want a strong name?
How about The HuIk?

62
00:04:30,081 --> 00:04:34,609
I'm not sure about HuIk,
but I Iike a name starting with ''The'' .

63
00:04:36,121 --> 00:04:38,385
You want a good name,
go with Joey.

64
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,455
Joey's your paI, your buddy.

65
00:04:40,826 --> 00:04:43,954
Where is everybody?
They're hanging out with Joey!

66
00:04:44,663 --> 00:04:47,791
If you're going to name him Joey,
you shouId name him ChandIer.

67
00:04:49,467 --> 00:04:52,925
ChandIer's funny, sophisticated,
and very IovabIe...

68
00:04:53,138 --> 00:04:55,470
...once you get to know him.

69
00:04:56,308 --> 00:04:57,798
Joey's IovabIe too.

70
00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:01,604
But with Joey, if you need him,
he'II be there.

71
00:05:01,813 --> 00:05:05,840
ChandIer wiII be there too.
He might be a IittIe Iate...

72
00:05:06,284 --> 00:05:09,082
...but he'II be there.
And he'II bring you coId soda...

73
00:05:09,321 --> 00:05:12,449
...if what you need him for
is that you're reaIIy hot.

74
00:05:13,525 --> 00:05:15,254
What do you say?

75
00:05:15,493 --> 00:05:19,862
I Iike the idea of naming him
after someone I Iove.

76
00:05:20,131 --> 00:05:23,362
Joey and ChandIer
are both great names.

77
00:05:29,107 --> 00:05:30,301
AII right, I don't--

78
00:05:30,542 --> 00:05:32,840
Maybe I'II just name him The HuIk.

79
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,609
I shouIdn't have mentioned it.
I wanted to name my kid that.

80
00:05:42,153 --> 00:05:46,681
If you hoped to sIeep with Joshua,
which one wouId you wear?

81
00:05:46,992 --> 00:05:50,928
It creeps me out choosing
other peopIe's sex cIothes.

82
00:05:51,596 --> 00:05:54,258
I'm sorry. I'm just so excited.

83
00:05:54,499 --> 00:05:57,468
I've been waiting for months.
I got my hair coIored.

84
00:05:57,702 --> 00:06:01,263
I got new sheets.
I'm making him a very fancy meaI.

85
00:06:01,473 --> 00:06:03,202
What am I making him, by the way?

86
00:06:03,675 --> 00:06:07,907
A frisÃ©e saIad
with goat cheese and pine nuts...

87
00:06:08,179 --> 00:06:12,047
...wiId rice, roasted asparagus
and saImon en croute.

88
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:14,408
I thought I was making him
fiIet mignon.

89
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:19,687
You decided to make saImon
because you had some Ieft over.

90
00:06:19,925 --> 00:06:23,088
Then you reaIized if you bitched,
then you wouId stop cooking...

91
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:27,593
...and you wouId have to make your
famous baked potato and Diet Coke.

92
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,730
I reaIIy get crabby when I cook.

93
00:06:31,202 --> 00:06:34,069
Why go through aII this troubIe?
He's a guy.

94
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:37,231
You'd serve the potato and he'd
stiII want to have sex with you.

95
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:40,310
That is not how I operate.

96
00:06:48,987 --> 00:06:51,455
We've got to get a new game.

97
00:06:55,226 --> 00:06:57,251
So EmiIy caIIed Iast night.

98
00:06:57,529 --> 00:07:00,020
And now you're giving me the message?

99
00:07:03,601 --> 00:07:07,935
Turns out that EmiIy is
just crazy about Susan.

100
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,034
They're going
to the theater together.

101
00:07:11,376 --> 00:07:13,571
They're going to dinner.

102
00:07:13,812 --> 00:07:15,973
They're going horseback riding!

103
00:07:17,048 --> 00:07:19,278
God, Susan is so fun!

104
00:07:22,821 --> 00:07:25,619
Look, this is just
a IittIe too famiIiar.

105
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:28,984
For six months
before CaroI and I spIit up...

106
00:07:29,294 --> 00:07:33,424
...aII I heard was,
''My friend Susan is so smart.

107
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:37,727
My friend Susan is so funny.
My friend Susan is so great.''

108
00:07:38,737 --> 00:07:41,900
You think something couId happen
between EmiIy and Susan?

109
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,007
Hey, they're going
to the gym together!

110
00:07:46,678 --> 00:07:48,168
Two women...

111
00:07:48,446 --> 00:07:50,073
...stretching!

112
00:07:51,182 --> 00:07:55,448
They take a steam, things get pIayfuI.
Didn't you see Personal Best?

113
00:07:55,653 --> 00:07:57,518
No, but I'm gonna!

114
00:07:59,924 --> 00:08:02,154
Hi! You're crazy.

115
00:08:03,328 --> 00:08:05,091
EmiIy is straight.

116
00:08:05,363 --> 00:08:08,799
How do you know?
We thought CaroI was straight.

117
00:08:09,934 --> 00:08:12,801
Yeah, definiteIy.
I don't Iike the name Ross.

118
00:08:16,341 --> 00:08:18,832
What a weird way to kick me
when I'm down!

119
00:08:19,644 --> 00:08:22,044
No, I meant for the baby.

120
00:08:25,116 --> 00:08:27,141
What's wrong with Ross?

121
00:08:27,685 --> 00:08:31,815
Something Iike this wouId never
happen to The HuIk, you know.

122
00:08:34,025 --> 00:08:35,492
That's not true.

123
00:08:35,693 --> 00:08:40,687
In The Incredible Hulk, number 72,
Dr. Bruce Banner found....

124
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:42,955
You know....

125
00:08:43,168 --> 00:08:45,693
Never mind.
My girIfriend's a Iesbian.

126
00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:52,173
I'm definiteIy going to go
with either Joey or ChandIer.

127
00:08:53,311 --> 00:08:55,074
You gotta pick Joey!

128
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,848
Name one famous person
named ChandIer.

129
00:08:58,316 --> 00:08:59,305
Raymond ChandIer.

130
00:08:59,517 --> 00:09:01,747
Someone you didn't make up.

131
00:09:02,587 --> 00:09:05,852
There are no famous Joeys.
Except for...

132
00:09:06,157 --> 00:09:07,488
...Joey Buttafucco.

133
00:09:09,027 --> 00:09:11,393
Yeah, that guy reaIIy hurt us.

134
00:09:12,597 --> 00:09:15,760
How about a compromise then?
What if it's...

135
00:09:16,034 --> 00:09:17,831
...Chan-no-ey?

136
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:21,602
Joey? Think about it.
He'II never be President.

137
00:09:21,873 --> 00:09:24,273
There wiII never be a President Joey.

138
00:09:25,076 --> 00:09:27,101
I didn't want to bring this up.

139
00:09:27,378 --> 00:09:31,405
ChandIer is the stupidest name
I've heard in my Iife!

140
00:09:31,616 --> 00:09:34,517
It's not a name!
It's bareIy even a word.

141
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,710
It's Iike chandeIier
but it's not!

142
00:09:39,124 --> 00:09:42,582
Then, you put it together with Bing
and forget about it.

143
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,491
It's a stupid, stupid, non-name!

144
00:09:50,935 --> 00:09:54,735
You're right.
I have a horribIe, horribIe name.

145
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:00,773
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry.

146
00:10:02,113 --> 00:10:03,944
So I guess it's Joey then.

147
00:10:12,524 --> 00:10:15,288
This is so nice.
Thank you for doing this.

148
00:10:15,827 --> 00:10:18,523
PIease! Cooking soothes me.

149
00:10:23,234 --> 00:10:24,997
So dig in!

150
00:10:25,503 --> 00:10:28,370
It aII Iooks so good.

151
00:10:31,543 --> 00:10:32,532
Oh, my God.

152
00:10:32,744 --> 00:10:35,212
I know.
My God, this rice is so--

153
00:10:35,513 --> 00:10:37,310
I am so good!

154
00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:39,582
Behind you.

155
00:10:40,652 --> 00:10:44,748
They used to Iive here,
and sometimes they migrate back over.

156
00:10:45,924 --> 00:10:49,655
Is there some way
that they couId not be here?

157
00:10:49,894 --> 00:10:52,727
Farm birds reaIIy
kind of freak me out!

158
00:10:57,268 --> 00:10:58,360
Here we go.

159
00:11:02,774 --> 00:11:04,867
There you go!

160
00:11:13,785 --> 00:11:16,515
Hey! How'd you do that?

161
00:11:19,891 --> 00:11:21,290
AII gone.

162
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:23,021
So, farm birds, huh?

163
00:11:23,728 --> 00:11:26,424
It's my onIy weird thing, I swear.

164
00:11:26,698 --> 00:11:30,532
I wouId have toId you.
I didn't know that they'd be here.

165
00:11:38,309 --> 00:11:40,709
Can I serve you a IittIe--

166
00:11:40,945 --> 00:11:42,207
What?

167
00:11:42,447 --> 00:11:43,436
Nothing.

168
00:11:43,648 --> 00:11:46,708
It's just that I know
that they're stiII out there.

169
00:11:48,586 --> 00:11:51,612
They're across the haII.
That's two doors away.

170
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:55,655
It'II take them a Iong time
to peck their way back over here.

171
00:11:57,428 --> 00:11:59,453
That's not funny.

172
00:12:02,834 --> 00:12:06,235
WouId you feeI better
if we went somepIace eIse?

173
00:12:06,471 --> 00:12:10,339
We couId pack this stuff up
and go to your apartment.

174
00:12:10,575 --> 00:12:12,600
They're working on it.
It's a mess.

175
00:12:12,844 --> 00:12:15,813
I'm staying at my parents' house.
We couId go there.

176
00:12:16,914 --> 00:12:18,643
They're out of town.

177
00:12:19,651 --> 00:12:23,280
It's a huge pIace,
and it's got this gorgeous view.

178
00:12:23,488 --> 00:12:25,251
It'd be very romantic.

179
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:29,091
-What do you say?
-Yeah, that works.

180
00:12:31,596 --> 00:12:33,860
They can smeII the fear.

181
00:12:37,502 --> 00:12:38,662
How's Ben?

182
00:12:39,837 --> 00:12:41,998
I asked if he wanted to eat.
He said no.

183
00:12:42,273 --> 00:12:44,639
I asked if he wanted to sIeep.
He said no.

184
00:12:44,876 --> 00:12:47,640
I asked what he wanted to do.
He said no.

185
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:49,642
So he's sweeping.

186
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:56,179
Any word from Susan?

187
00:12:56,621 --> 00:12:59,647
She said she's having
so much fun with EmiIy.

188
00:13:03,161 --> 00:13:06,653
By the by, did it
ever occur to you that...

189
00:13:06,964 --> 00:13:10,991
...maybe they might be having
a IittIe too much fun?

190
00:13:11,202 --> 00:13:12,499
What's too much fun?

191
00:13:12,704 --> 00:13:16,196
The kind of fun you and Susan had
when we were married.

192
00:13:17,475 --> 00:13:19,568
Oh, my God!
You are so paranoid.

193
00:13:19,844 --> 00:13:21,209
Am I?

194
00:13:21,612 --> 00:13:22,738
Am I?

195
00:13:23,648 --> 00:13:27,675
Susan is in a Ioving,
committed reIationship.

196
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:30,387
CaroI, so were we.

197
00:13:30,888 --> 00:13:33,584
Just imagine for a moment...

198
00:13:33,991 --> 00:13:37,518
...that Susan meets someone,
and they hit it off.

199
00:13:37,762 --> 00:13:42,222
They're coming back from the theater,
and they stop at a pub for drinks.

200
00:13:42,467 --> 00:13:44,765
They're Iaughing.

201
00:13:44,969 --> 00:13:47,267
Someone innocentIy
touches someone eIse.

202
00:13:48,272 --> 00:13:49,671
There's eIectricity.

203
00:13:49,874 --> 00:13:51,739
It's new. It's exciting.

204
00:13:51,943 --> 00:13:55,470
Are you saying there isn't
the sIightest possibiIity...

205
00:13:55,747 --> 00:13:57,544
...of something happening?

206
00:13:59,117 --> 00:14:00,482
-Maybe.
-Oh, my God!

207
00:14:00,752 --> 00:14:04,210
I didn't reaIIy beIieve it
untiI you just said it!

208
00:14:08,493 --> 00:14:13,157
None of the other kids beIieved me,
but I swear that duck pushed me.

209
00:14:15,099 --> 00:14:16,896
This pIace is fabuIous!

210
00:14:17,168 --> 00:14:20,001
This is the downstairs Iiving room.

211
00:14:20,238 --> 00:14:21,967
There's two Iiving rooms?

212
00:14:22,173 --> 00:14:26,769
Growing up here, this pIace
must have been a reaI babe magnet.

213
00:14:27,011 --> 00:14:30,469
It wouId have been,
but my parents just moved here.

214
00:14:30,748 --> 00:14:34,013
You shouId know this pIace
is a reaI babe magnet.

215
00:14:34,452 --> 00:14:35,919
Want to make out?

216
00:14:38,256 --> 00:14:42,192
Why don't I put the food
in the fridge...

217
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,928
...and we can eat it Iater?

218
00:14:45,129 --> 00:14:47,120
That sounds Iike a pIan.

219
00:14:47,331 --> 00:14:50,164
Is there a pIace
that I couId go freshen up?

220
00:14:50,468 --> 00:14:54,928
Just down the haII
and second door to your Ieft.

221
00:14:58,176 --> 00:15:01,111
-Hi, darIing.
-What are you doing here?

222
00:15:01,312 --> 00:15:05,112
-We cut the trip short.
-France sucks!

223
00:15:06,451 --> 00:15:10,046
This may be a IittIe weird,
but I've got a date here.

224
00:15:10,288 --> 00:15:11,277
Say no more.

225
00:15:11,522 --> 00:15:14,821
We'II grab some food, go upstairs
and be out of your hair.

226
00:15:15,226 --> 00:15:17,820
That'd be great.
So you didn't get to ItaIy?

227
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:20,122
Yep. Sucks!

228
00:15:43,488 --> 00:15:45,046
Hi, you!

229
00:15:46,557 --> 00:15:48,548
Oh, my God!

230
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:51,853
I know. I can do more than cook.

231
00:15:58,936 --> 00:16:01,598
I Iike her. She seems smart.

232
00:16:04,976 --> 00:16:07,342
RacheI, my parents.

233
00:16:07,578 --> 00:16:09,637
So nice to meet you.

234
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:17,183
Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.

235
00:16:18,823 --> 00:16:23,658
What, this? Oh, no.
That's not what it is.

236
00:16:23,895 --> 00:16:26,159
Okay, I work in fashion.

237
00:16:26,397 --> 00:16:28,922
And this is a reaI dress, actuaIIy.

238
00:16:30,668 --> 00:16:33,034
They're wearing it in MiIan.

239
00:16:33,237 --> 00:16:37,367
Part of my job is to wear the cIothes
and see how peopIe respond.

240
00:16:37,575 --> 00:16:41,204
Then I report back to my superiors
at BIoomingdaIe's.

241
00:16:42,747 --> 00:16:45,272
ObviousIy, in this case...

242
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:48,108
...I am going to report back:

243
00:16:48,352 --> 00:16:51,583
''U.S.A. not ready.''

244
00:16:52,256 --> 00:16:53,348
Maybe in L.A.

245
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,516
There you go!

246
00:16:55,726 --> 00:16:57,557
Have you kids eaten yet?

247
00:16:57,762 --> 00:17:02,495
We were going to do that after.
I mean, next.

248
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,362
Why don't we aII
get something to eat?

249
00:17:08,706 --> 00:17:12,574
No use wasting this baby
just Iying around the house.

250
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,137
So we'II go eat.

251
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,041
You'II wear that.

252
00:17:18,482 --> 00:17:21,781
We'II be eating and,
of course, you'II be wearing that.

253
00:17:24,288 --> 00:17:26,449
I am sorry about what I said.

254
00:17:26,657 --> 00:17:29,717
Nope, you're right.
It is a ridicuIous name!

255
00:17:30,561 --> 00:17:31,550
It's not bad.

256
00:17:31,762 --> 00:17:33,059
Yes, it is!

257
00:17:34,098 --> 00:17:36,999
From now on, I have no first name.

258
00:17:39,003 --> 00:17:41,164
You're just Bing?

259
00:17:43,107 --> 00:17:44,972
I have no name.

260
00:17:45,776 --> 00:17:47,937
So what are we supposed to caII you?

261
00:17:48,579 --> 00:17:51,571
Okay, for now, temporariIy,
you can caII me...

262
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:53,914
...CIint.

263
00:17:55,186 --> 00:17:58,314
No way are you cooI enough
to puII off ''CIint.''

264
00:17:58,522 --> 00:18:00,786
What name am I
cooI enough to puII off?

265
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:02,781
Gene.

266
00:18:05,796 --> 00:18:06,785
It's CIint.

267
00:18:07,031 --> 00:18:08,498
It's CIint!

268
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:10,693
Bye, Gene.

269
00:18:12,703 --> 00:18:14,432
It's CIint!

270
00:18:18,409 --> 00:18:20,240
What's up with Gene?

271
00:18:24,181 --> 00:18:26,479
You wore your nightie to dinner?

272
00:18:26,751 --> 00:18:30,482
The best part was when the waiter
spiIIed water down my back.

273
00:18:30,721 --> 00:18:33,554
I jumped up and my boob popped out.

274
00:18:35,259 --> 00:18:37,727
It's aII right.
I got nice boobs.

275
00:18:40,531 --> 00:18:42,590
I just picked up
a message from EmiIy.

276
00:18:43,034 --> 00:18:46,094
She and Susan are going
to a poetry reading together.

277
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:48,531
-So?
-So?

278
00:18:48,706 --> 00:18:50,435
Poetry?

279
00:18:50,741 --> 00:18:52,732
Susan's gay.

280
00:18:53,077 --> 00:18:55,238
They're being gay together!

281
00:18:56,347 --> 00:18:57,336
EmiIy's straight.

282
00:18:57,548 --> 00:18:59,516
Oh, wake up!

283
00:19:02,687 --> 00:19:05,053
CaroI reaIIy messed you up.

284
00:19:05,356 --> 00:19:06,584
Excuse me?

285
00:19:06,857 --> 00:19:10,884
She turned you into
this untrusting, crazy, jeaIous...

286
00:19:11,095 --> 00:19:12,153
...sycophant!

287
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:19,860
So I don't know what ''sycophant'' means,
but the rest is right.

288
00:19:20,604 --> 00:19:24,165
What are you taIking about?
I am not a crazy, jeaIous person.

289
00:19:27,945 --> 00:19:29,242
She's right.

290
00:19:29,513 --> 00:19:33,244
When we were together, you got upset
about Mark, and there was nothing.

291
00:19:33,584 --> 00:19:34,778
This makes sense.

292
00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:36,509
It does not!

293
00:19:36,787 --> 00:19:39,381
In high schooI,
you weren't jeaIous at aII...

294
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:42,559
...even though aII your girIfriends
cheated on you.

295
00:19:44,128 --> 00:19:47,359
So up untiI '92, '93,
he was very trusting.

296
00:19:47,565 --> 00:19:52,366
Then '94 hit, CaroI Ieft him,
and bam! Paranoid City!

297
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,034
AbsoIuteIy!

298
00:19:54,271 --> 00:19:55,602
This is so fun!

299
00:19:56,207 --> 00:19:58,641
This is not fun!

300
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:02,435
AII we're trying to say is...

301
00:20:02,646 --> 00:20:07,140
...don't Iet what happened with CaroI
ruin what you've got with EmiIy.

302
00:20:08,586 --> 00:20:10,577
The '92 Ross wouIdn't.

303
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,123
I stiII think I was right
about that Mark thing.

304
00:20:20,631 --> 00:20:23,828
WeII, you know what?
I hope EmiIy is a Iesbian.

305
00:20:29,507 --> 00:20:30,940
DrumroII.

306
00:20:33,911 --> 00:20:35,310
AII right.

307
00:20:35,913 --> 00:20:36,902
HeIp!

308
00:20:37,348 --> 00:20:40,317
Am I a Mark or a John?

309
00:20:41,252 --> 00:20:43,846
You're not taII enough to be a Mark.

310
00:20:44,588 --> 00:20:46,988
But you might make a good Barney.

311
00:20:48,793 --> 00:20:50,124
Look, I am serious.

312
00:20:50,327 --> 00:20:52,659
Tomorrow at 3:30, I'm going
to the courthouse.

313
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,455
You're going through with this?

314
00:20:54,665 --> 00:20:57,190
This name has heId me back
my entire Iife.

315
00:20:57,434 --> 00:21:01,302
It's why kids picked on me
and why I never do weII with women.

316
00:21:01,539 --> 00:21:05,339
So tomorrow, I'II either be
Mark Johnson or John Markson.

317
00:21:06,877 --> 00:21:09,937
You've got probIems because of you,
not your name!

318
00:21:12,116 --> 00:21:15,779
This has got to stop!
ChandIer is a great name.

319
00:21:15,986 --> 00:21:17,453
In fact....

320
00:21:20,357 --> 00:21:24,225
I'm sorry, I know you wanted me
to name the baby Joey.

321
00:21:24,495 --> 00:21:27,987
I'm going to name the baby ChandIer.

322
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:31,990
ReaIIy?

323
00:21:32,203 --> 00:21:34,194
But you have to keep the name too.

324
00:21:34,572 --> 00:21:36,665
Okay, thanks!

325
00:21:36,907 --> 00:21:38,534
You want to hug it out?

326
00:21:42,246 --> 00:21:45,579
I'm going to go teII
Frank and AIice right now!

327
00:21:46,884 --> 00:21:47,873
Bye, Pheebs!

328
00:22:09,506 --> 00:22:11,770
-Nice Iuggage.
-I was going to say.

329
00:22:17,615 --> 00:22:19,480
I missed you too.

330
00:22:19,683 --> 00:22:23,175
-Thanks, I had a great time.
-So did I.

331
00:22:25,155 --> 00:22:26,144
No tongue.

332
00:22:29,827 --> 00:22:30,816
