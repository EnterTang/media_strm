1
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:05,446
喂

2
00:00:05,183 --> 00:00:07,845
It's me. I know you can't stand to see me.

3
00:00:05,551 --> 00:00:08,247
是我 我知道你不想跟我共处一室

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,612
I'm trying to apologize over the phone--

5
00:00:08,353 --> 00:00:10,753
我想用电话跟你道歉…

6
00:00:16,762 --> 00:00:17,694
喂

7
00:00:19,164 --> 00:00:22,099
I shouldn't have kissed your girlfriend--

8
00:00:19,331 --> 00:00:21,162
我不该亲你的女朋友…

9
00:00:25,971 --> 00:00:27,131
Stop calling!

10
00:00:26,371 --> 00:00:27,429
别再打来了

11
00:00:27,339 --> 00:00:31,469
This is 92.3 WXRK, K-Rock...

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,233
这里是92.3摇滚广播电台

13
00:00:31,677 --> 00:00:34,202
...calling with our $ 1 000 daily challenge!

14
00:00:32,344 --> 00:00:34,437
您是今天的千元挑战者

15
00:00:34,513 --> 00:00:35,673
All right!

16
00:00:34,846 --> 00:00:35,778
漂亮

17
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:37,007
What is the name of...

18
00:00:36,315 --> 00:00:40,718
请问你那位非常抱歉 愿意尽全力…

19
00:00:37,282 --> 00:00:41,446
...your roommate who is very sorry and would do anything--?

20
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:50,495
-Damn it, Chandler, stop calling. -Joey, it's Ross.

21
00:00:47,326 --> 00:00:48,657
钱德，别再打来了

22
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,227
乔伊，我是罗斯

23
00:00:50,696 --> 00:00:51,822
-Sorry. -lt's all right.

24
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:52,126
对不起 没关系

25
00:00:51,964 --> 00:00:53,056
What's up?

26
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,664
什么事？ 也没什么

27
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:59,159
Not much. l got Chandler here and he's really, really sorry--

28
00:00:54,766 --> 00:00:57,633
钱德在我这边，他非常非常…

29
00:00:59,404 --> 00:01:01,668

32
00:01:46,251 --> 00:01:48,151
Oh, turkey!

33
00:01:47,252 --> 00:01:50,517
火鸡…说谢谢

34
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,082
Giving thanks!

35
00:01:51,923 --> 00:01:54,414
看，这就是感恩节的精神

36
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,857
Look, everyone. lt's the spirit of Thanksgiving!

37
00:01:55,761 --> 00:01:57,319
Are things with Joey better?

38
00:01:55,827 --> 00:01:57,419
你跟乔伊好一点了吗？

39
00:01:57,529 --> 00:01:58,393
糟到不能再糟

40
00:01:57,562 --> 00:02:00,292
They couldn't be worse. l spent eight hours calling him...

41
00:01:58,497 --> 00:02:02,627
我昨晚打了8小时电话给他 想让他跟我说上一句话

42
00:02:00,532 --> 00:02:02,432
...trying to get him to talk to me.

43
00:02:02,734 --> 00:02:05,430
8小时

44
00:02:04,136 --> 00:02:05,228
Eight hours.

45
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:09,201
You could probably use a plug-in telephone headset.

46
00:02:05,537 --> 00:02:09,166
你应该用得上耳机吧？

47
00:02:09,441 --> 00:02:13,775
Should we all expect Christmas gifts that are stolen from your office?

48
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:13,769
我们会收到 你从公司偷来的圣诞礼物吗？

49
00:02:14,846 --> 00:02:16,438
制片：塔德史帝文斯

50
00:02:16,381 --> 00:02:17,473
You shouldn't.

51
00:02:16,548 --> 00:02:17,480
你不会

52
00:02:19,451 --> 00:02:20,645
Speaking of Christmas....

53
00:02:19,551 --> 00:02:20,813
讲到圣诞节 编剧：麦可波考

54
00:02:20,886 --> 00:02:24,788
Since Monica and l are starting a new business and have no money...

55
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:24,252
摩妮卡和我刚开业，没有钱

56
00:02:24,356 --> 00:02:27,223
今年就来抽签互送吧 导演：彼得邦纳兹

57
00:02:25,057 --> 00:02:29,653
...this year we could do Secret Santa and each only buy one gift.

58
00:02:27,325 --> 00:02:32,922
这样只要买一份礼物 还可以猜猜看谁抽到谁

59
00:02:29,928 --> 00:02:33,125
And there's the added mystery of who gets who.

60
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,397
Who gets whom.

61
00:02:35,267 --> 00:02:36,359
谁抽到“哪个人”

62
00:02:38,603 --> 00:02:40,628
l don't know why l do that.

63
00:02:38,837 --> 00:02:39,861
我是无意识的

64
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,104
But it is correct.

65
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:43,906
但那样才合文法

66
00:02:45,243 --> 00:02:48,303
Hey, what's this? lt's all of your names.

67
00:02:45,644 --> 00:02:46,668
这是什么？

68
00:02:47,212 --> 00:02:49,237
是你们的名字！来抽吧

69
00:02:48,447 --> 00:02:50,574
Let's pick.

70
00:02:52,017 --> 00:02:53,348
你们在…
Hey, what's going--?

71
00:02:56,021 --> 00:03:00,151
-No, Joey, stay. -We're picking names for Secret Santa.

72
00:02:56,221 --> 00:02:57,415
乔伊，不要走

73
00:02:57,522 --> 00:02:59,854
乔伊，快来，我们要抽签送礼

74
00:03:00,325 --> 00:03:02,293
Okay.

75
00:03:00,492 --> 00:03:01,550
好啦

76
00:03:02,728 --> 00:03:05,561
l invented Secret Santa, you know.

77
00:03:02,894 --> 00:03:04,521
这个做法是我发明的

78
00:03:07,532 --> 00:03:10,899
What are you laughing at? You're the one who said Die Hard was your idea.

79
00:03:07,566 --> 00:03:08,794
你笑什么？

80
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,800
你也说“终极警探” 是你的构想

81
00:03:10,902 --> 00:03:12,233
本来就是

82
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:13,299
lt was.

83
00:03:14,072 --> 00:03:17,473
Don't make me show you the napkin.

84
00:03:14,306 --> 00:03:16,331
别逼我把纸巾拿出来

85
00:03:23,582 --> 00:03:26,676
l'm going to take a nap. Turkey makes me sleepy.

86
00:03:23,682 --> 00:03:26,708
我要去睡个觉，火鸡让我爱

87
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:28,746
We haven't eaten yet.

88
00:03:27,252 --> 00:03:28,446
还没吃耶

89
00:03:29,454 --> 00:03:33,857
l know, but all that work you're doing to get it ready and....

90
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:31,987
我知道，但你那堆准备过程…

91
00:03:35,627 --> 00:03:39,427
Did you pick Rachel for your Secret Santa? l'll trade for her.

92
00:03:35,727 --> 00:03:39,686
你们有人抽到瑞秋吗？我要换

93
00:03:39,798 --> 00:03:41,959
我抽到她，幸好你要她

94
00:03:39,831 --> 00:03:43,198
l picked her. Thank God, you want her!

95
00:03:43,535 --> 00:03:45,833
Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?

96
00:03:43,802 --> 00:03:45,497
你为什么这么想换掉她？

97
00:03:45,604 --> 00:03:50,632
因为她收到什么都拿去换 要让她满意根本不可能

98
00:03:46,037 --> 00:03:47,971
She exchanges every gift she gets.

99
00:03:48,206 --> 00:03:50,606
lt's impossible to get her something she likes.

100
00:03:50,809 --> 00:03:52,003
来换吧
Come on, let's trade!

101
00:03:52,611 --> 00:03:55,307
l got her that backpack and she loved it.

102
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:55,609
哪有这回事 她很喜欢我送她的背包

103
00:03:55,514 --> 00:03:58,381
l remember she cried when that big dog ran off with--

104
00:03:55,714 --> 00:03:59,047
有只大狗把它叼走时 她哭得好…

105
00:04:01,553 --> 00:04:03,350
There was no big dog.

106
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,948
没有什么大狗

107
00:04:04,656 --> 00:04:09,389
This sucks! l already got her a briefcase with ''R.G.'' put on it.

108
00:04:04,823 --> 00:04:08,657
真是的，我已经买了个公事包 还拿去烫了RG

109
00:04:09,861 --> 00:04:12,159
Her initials.

110
00:04:09,928 --> 00:04:11,020
她的姓名缩写

111
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:16,523
Okay, l'm really bad at initials.

112
00:04:13,999 --> 00:04:15,398
我很不会认缩写

113
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:19,066
You got your shopping done early.

114
00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:19,332
你今年礼物买得真早

115
00:04:19,204 --> 00:04:22,833
Yeah, well, my Camel Cash was about to expire.

116
00:04:19,437 --> 00:04:21,632
我的礼券快过期了

117
00:04:23,275 --> 00:04:26,301
Maybe you can give it to somebody else. Like Ross Geller!

118
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:24,931
也许你可以送给别人

119
00:04:25,043 --> 00:04:26,704
像罗斯盖勒（缩写亦为RG）

120
00:04:27,145 --> 00:04:29,477
You know what? lt's a girlie briefcase.

121
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:30,047
那是个女用公事包

122
00:04:29,948 --> 00:04:33,213
Who cares! He works in a museum.

123
00:04:30,348 --> 00:04:31,975
那又怎样，他在博物馆上班

124
00:04:34,586 --> 00:04:36,747
The big game's about to start!

125
00:04:34,753 --> 00:04:36,948
现在几点？球赛要开始了

126
00:04:36,955 --> 00:04:40,118
Ross and Joey aren't here. You can watch the parade if you want.

127
00:04:37,055 --> 00:04:37,919
不必ㄍ一ㄥ了

128
00:04:38,023 --> 00:04:40,924
罗斯乔伊不在，你可以看游行 谢了

129
00:04:40,292 --> 00:04:42,021
Thanks.

130
00:04:43,028 --> 00:04:44,791
这个冷冻库怎么搞的

131
00:04:43,094 --> 00:04:45,187
What is wrong with this freezer?

132
00:04:46,865 --> 00:04:49,265
-What happened? -lce just got in my eye!

133
00:04:46,898 --> 00:04:49,458
怎么了？ 我的眼睛被冰扎到

134
00:04:49,901 --> 00:04:52,927
People are trying to sleep in here!

135
00:04:50,068 --> 00:04:52,093
这里有人要睡觉

136
00:04:53,071 --> 00:04:55,096
摩妮卡的眼睛被冰扎到很痛

137
00:04:53,205 --> 00:04:55,070
Monica got ice in her eye and it hurts!

138
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:58,241
-Open it up. Let me see. -l can't. lt really kills.

139
00:04:55,373 --> 00:04:58,399
张开让我看看 不行，真的很痛

140
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,909
也许你应该冰敷
Maybe you should put some ice on it.

141
00:05:02,948 --> 00:05:05,940
好像很严重 去看医生好了
-lt looks bad. -We should take you to a doctor.

142
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:07,680
No, my eye doctor is Richard!

143
00:05:06,051 --> 00:05:07,985
不行，我的眼科医生是理查

144
00:05:07,953 --> 00:05:10,751
l can't go to him when l don't have a boyfriend.

145
00:05:08,086 --> 00:05:10,054
我没有男朋友不能去见他

146
00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:13,655
He's really picky about his patients.

147
00:05:11,423 --> 00:05:12,890
他对病患还真挑剔

148
00:05:14,326 --> 00:05:16,817
You've got to go. What's his office number?

149
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:17,053
你非去不可 他的诊所电话几号？

150
00:05:17,295 --> 00:05:19,695
Like l remember his office number!

151
00:05:17,429 --> 00:05:19,056
我哪会记得

152
00:05:19,898 --> 00:05:21,388
Speed dial seven.

153
00:05:20,098 --> 00:05:21,087
速拨键七

154
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:26,867
喂，我代表摩妮卡盖勒的眼睛

155
00:05:24,102 --> 00:05:27,037
l'm calling on behalf of Monica Geller's eye.

156
00:05:28,473 --> 00:05:31,135
ls Richard Burke in today?

157
00:05:28,707 --> 00:05:30,902
理查柏克今天在吗？

158
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,074
He's not in. Will she see the on-call doctor?

159
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,470
他不在，她愿意看候诊医师吗

160
00:05:34,312 --> 00:05:37,577
-Yes. -She's very excited about that!

161
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:37,047
愿意！ 愿意！她非常兴奋

162
00:05:38,316 --> 00:05:40,147
Okay, we'll be right in.

163
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:39,815
好，我们马上过去

164
00:05:40,285 --> 00:05:42,253
Okay, so who's gonna take her in?

165
00:05:40,485 --> 00:05:42,646
谁要带她去？

166
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,412
l'll go, you can watch your parade.

167
00:05:42,754 --> 00:05:44,153
我来，你去看游行

168
00:05:49,594 --> 00:05:53,792
lt's so cool. Till Monica gets back, l'm head chef.

169
00:05:49,995 --> 00:05:53,863
酷毙了 摩妮卡回来之前，我是主厨

170
00:05:54,032 --> 00:05:56,523
And l get to make all the decisions.

171
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:56,030
我可以做决定

172
00:05:57,502 --> 00:06:00,369
She told you to follow the recipe exactly.

173
00:05:57,736 --> 00:06:00,796
她叫你完全照食谱来

174
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,334
Get out of my kitchen.

175
00:06:00,906 --> 00:06:01,964
滚出我的厨房

176
00:06:04,042 --> 00:06:07,011
l think l'm making some progress with Joey.

177
00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:07,503
好，我跟乔伊有进展了

178
00:06:07,212 --> 00:06:09,772
When l walked in, he went to his bedroom...

179
00:06:07,612 --> 00:06:11,639
我进门时，他走进他的房间 但只摔了一次门

180
00:06:10,015 --> 00:06:12,984
...but he only slammed the door once.

181
00:06:13,151 --> 00:06:15,745
不过摔的时候有比中指
Yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.

182
00:06:16,955 --> 00:06:21,415
l've got to call my mom and ask her a left-handed cooking question.

183
00:06:17,122 --> 00:06:21,491
我得问我妈左手烹饪的问题

184
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:26,359
l'm gonna be in there.

185
00:06:24,462 --> 00:06:28,159
我要进房里去 我不在的时候…

186
00:06:26,665 --> 00:06:28,895
While l'm gone....

187
00:06:31,403 --> 00:06:34,133
Chandler, you're in charge.

188
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:33,059
钱德，你负责

189
00:06:36,574 --> 00:06:40,567
l picked Monica for Secret Santa, but l'm getting her something for Hanukkah.

190
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:39,500
我抽到摩妮卡

191
00:06:39,611 --> 00:06:42,637
但我已经替她买了光明节礼物 你想换吗？

192
00:06:40,845 --> 00:06:42,506
You want to switch?

193
00:06:43,014 --> 00:06:45,312
l was trying to trade...

194
00:06:43,081 --> 00:06:46,642
其实我想换成你

195
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,574
...for you.

196
00:06:48,954 --> 00:06:51,946
真的？真好，你要送我什么？

197
00:06:48,987 --> 00:06:51,854
Really? That's so nice. What are you getting me?

198
00:06:52,057 --> 00:06:54,890
不晓得，RG 某种女性化的上班用品吧
l don't know, R.G. l was thinking something girlie for your office.

199
00:06:57,762 --> 00:07:00,162
也许菲比会跟我换

200
00:06:57,829 --> 00:07:00,593
Maybe Phoebe will switch with me.

201
00:07:00,632 --> 00:07:05,160
最好不要，那你会抽到瑞秋 她什么礼物都拿去换

202
00:07:00,865 --> 00:07:05,165
Then you'll get stuck with Rachel, and she exchanges every gift.

203
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,137
乱讲 我送她很多东西她都没退

204
00:07:05,403 --> 00:07:08,236
No, l got her lots of stuff she never took back.

205
00:07:08,239 --> 00:07:09,604
像什么？

206
00:07:08,506 --> 00:07:09,495
Like?

207
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:12,176
像我去年送她的金项链
Like that gold necklace l got her last year.

208
00:07:12,444 --> 00:07:13,843
When did she wear it last?

209
00:07:12,477 --> 00:07:14,001
她上次戴是哪时？

210
00:07:14,179 --> 00:07:17,171
她圣诞节整天都戴着，然后…

211
00:07:14,346 --> 00:07:18,282
She wore it all Christmas day and then....

212
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:20,543
Big dog?

213
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,711
大狗？

214
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:28,683
What are you doing?

215
00:07:27,826 --> 00:07:28,724
你在干什么？

216
00:07:28,827 --> 00:07:31,660
把钱德因内疚买的东西退回去

217
00:07:28,893 --> 00:07:31,418
Sending back this stuff Chandler bought.

218
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:35,725
-Even the TV? -No, l'll put that in my room.

219
00:07:32,163 --> 00:07:33,755
全部？包括电视？

220
00:07:33,865 --> 00:07:35,127
不，电视要搬进房里

221
00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:41,565
Listen, Joey. l know what he did was wrong.

222
00:07:37,602 --> 00:07:41,538
乔伊，我知道他做错了

223
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,834
但你就不能听他解释吗？

224
00:07:41,806 --> 00:07:43,535
But can't you hear him out?

225
00:07:44,142 --> 00:07:45,632
你和瑞秋在一起时
lf Chandler had kissed Rachel, would you hear him out?

226
00:07:45,744 --> 00:07:47,905
要是钱德吻了她 你会听他解释吗？

227
00:07:48,713 --> 00:07:50,237
That's a good point.

228
00:07:48,813 --> 00:07:49,802
说得好

229
00:07:51,282 --> 00:07:53,614
How long you going to punish him?

230
00:07:51,316 --> 00:07:54,683
那你要罚他多久？ 5年

231
00:07:53,852 --> 00:07:55,410
Five years.

232
00:07:56,621 --> 00:07:57,610
You've sentenced him?

233
00:07:56,721 --> 00:08:00,213
你还判了刑？ 不敢当就不要做

234
00:07:58,023 --> 00:08:00,856
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.

235
00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:03,020
The guy's your best friend.

236
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:04,858
他是你最要好的朋友 那是以前

237
00:08:03,294 --> 00:08:05,125
Was my best friend.

238
00:08:05,263 --> 00:08:07,322
你干嘛拼命替他说情？

239
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,298
l don't know why you're pushing for him.

240
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,194
少了他碍事 我就没有最要好的朋友了
With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open.

241
00:08:13,538 --> 00:08:16,063
-Who, me? -Yeah.

242
00:08:13,872 --> 00:08:15,305
我吗？ 对

243
00:08:17,108 --> 00:08:21,044
l'm honored. You know what l'm going to do as your best friend?

244
00:08:17,242 --> 00:08:21,008
我真荣幸 你知道我首先要做什么？

245
00:08:21,346 --> 00:08:23,109
拉你去跟钱德说话

246
00:08:21,446 --> 00:08:23,812
l'm going to get you to talk to Chandler.

247
00:08:25,617 --> 00:08:27,141
All right.

248
00:08:25,717 --> 00:08:26,741
好啦

249
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:30,049
But if you weren't my best friend....

250
00:08:27,952 --> 00:08:29,749
若非你是我最好的朋友…

251
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,690
Oh, my God. ls it really that bad?

252
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,954
天哪，真的那么严重？

253
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:37,154
l walk in the room, and he won't talk to me.

254
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,290
我进了门，他根本不理我

255
00:08:37,362 --> 00:08:40,331
He just mumbles something in ltalian.

256
00:08:37,562 --> 00:08:39,826
只念了几句意大利文

257
00:08:41,499 --> 00:08:44,229
And l know he only knows the bad words.

258
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:44,134
我知道他只会脏话

259
00:08:46,071 --> 00:08:49,700
l'm so, so sorry. l feel responsible.

260
00:08:46,171 --> 00:08:49,902
真对不起，都是我不好

261
00:08:49,841 --> 00:08:52,002
lt's not your fault.

262
00:08:50,008 --> 00:08:51,202
不是你的错

263
00:08:54,712 --> 00:08:59,479
-Gunther, have you seen Chandler? -l thought you were Chandler.

264
00:08:54,946 --> 00:08:57,346
阿甘，你有看见钱德吗？

265
00:08:58,216 --> 00:08:59,376
我以为你才是钱德

266
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,184
But one of you is over there.

267
00:09:03,188 --> 00:09:04,212
你们其中一个在那边

268
00:09:12,564 --> 00:09:14,862
Hey, Joe.

269
00:09:13,164 --> 00:09:14,096
乔伊

270
00:09:15,266 --> 00:09:16,961
（意大利文）

271
00:09:23,575 --> 00:09:26,874
l'll be right with you. Thanks for coming in.

272
00:09:23,908 --> 00:09:26,206
我马上就好 谢谢你

273
00:09:27,946 --> 00:09:32,076
Oh, my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?

274
00:09:28,313 --> 00:09:31,612
天哪，这个候诊医生真帅

275
00:09:32,584 --> 00:09:36,452
So cute that l'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.

276
00:09:32,984 --> 00:09:35,714
帅到我想拿笔插我的眼睛

277
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:48,993
你的眼科医生缘真好 我知道

278
00:09:45,363 --> 00:09:50,096
-You have the best luck with eye doctors. -l know.

279
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:52,759
柏克医生可以见你了
Dr. Burke will see you now.

280
00:09:52,871 --> 00:09:57,240
不是柏克医生，柏克医生不在 是候诊医生要帮我看

281
00:09:53,338 --> 00:09:57,035
Not Dr. Burke. The on-call doctor will see me now.

282
00:09:57,342 --> 00:10:01,676
理查柏克医生不在 他儿子提摩西柏克医生帮你看

283
00:09:57,442 --> 00:09:58,704
Dr. Richard Burke is out.

284
00:09:58,977 --> 00:10:02,208
Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see you now.

285
00:10:03,848 --> 00:10:05,543
Ready?

286
00:10:04,082 --> 00:10:05,242
准备好了吗？

287
00:10:12,423 --> 00:10:14,414
Hey, l'm sorry. That--

288
00:10:12,857 --> 00:10:14,347
对不起，刚才…

289
00:10:15,894 --> 00:10:18,590
-Where you going? -My folks' .

290
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,928
你要去哪里？ 我爸妈家

291
00:10:20,398 --> 00:10:21,990
什么时候回来？

292
00:10:20,565 --> 00:10:22,089
When you coming back?

293
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:26,770
l don't know. l might stay there while l look for an apartment.

294
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:26,201
不知道 可能会住几天顺便找房子

295
00:10:27,772 --> 00:10:28,761
What?

296
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:29,131
什么？

297
00:10:29,307 --> 00:10:33,641
l thought we could talk about this. Work it out.

298
00:10:30,975 --> 00:10:32,966
原先我以为我们可以谈开来

299
00:10:33,077 --> 00:10:35,272
但是看到你们在一起…

300
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:35,836
Seeing you two together, l don't....

301
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:39,339
你要我说什么？ 说我不见她吗？

302
00:10:36,114 --> 00:10:39,345
What do you want me to say? Should l stop seeing her?

303
00:10:39,584 --> 00:10:42,075
lt's not about her. Okay?

304
00:10:39,751 --> 00:10:42,242
跟她无关，好吗？

305
00:10:42,353 --> 00:10:45,379
但看到你们在一起 就让我想起你做的事
But seeing you together reminds me of what you did.

306
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:50,584
l won't live with someone who doesn't know what it is to be a friend.

307
00:10:46,124 --> 00:10:49,924
我不跟一个不懂朋友道义的人 住在一起

308
00:10:50,028 --> 00:10:50,892
再见

309
00:10:50,862 --> 00:10:54,923
l know what it is to be a friend. l screwed up.

310
00:10:50,995 --> 00:10:54,897
我懂朋友道义，只是我搞砸了

311
00:10:54,999 --> 00:10:56,728
对，没错

312
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,656
Yeah, you did.

313
00:10:57,669 --> 00:10:59,660
And that's why l'm leaving.

314
00:10:57,802 --> 00:10:59,269
所以我要离开

315
00:11:00,605 --> 00:11:05,099
lf you're not going to stay for me, then at least stay for them.

316
00:11:00,772 --> 00:11:03,502
你不为我留下来 至少为它们留下来

317
00:11:05,977 --> 00:11:09,310
它们这1年很不顺，还被抢

318
00:11:06,311 --> 00:11:10,008
They had a very difficult year. What with the robbery and all.

319
00:11:10,348 --> 00:11:13,442
And that chick used to be very cute.

320
00:11:10,415 --> 00:11:13,077
小鸡本来很可爱的

321
00:11:13,618 --> 00:11:15,176
When that guy was robbing us...

322
00:11:14,118 --> 00:11:18,054
当那个人抢了我们 我在柜子里关了6小时

323
00:11:15,386 --> 00:11:18,219
...and l was locked in the entertainment unit for six hours...

324
00:11:18,156 --> 00:11:22,320
你知道我在做什么？ 我在想我太让你失望了

325
00:11:18,356 --> 00:11:20,017
...do you know what l was doing?

326
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,782
l was thinking about how l let you down.

327
00:11:23,995 --> 00:11:28,455
对，早知道你会见色忘友 我根本不会担心

328
00:11:24,729 --> 00:11:29,291
lf l knew what kind of friend you'd be, l wouldn't have worried.

329
00:11:28,733 --> 00:11:29,529
再见

330
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:34,529
等一下…一定有什么我能做的

331
00:11:30,868 --> 00:11:34,565
Wait one second! There has to be something that l can do.

332
00:11:34,772 --> 00:11:36,171
lf we still had that unit...

333
00:11:35,006 --> 00:11:39,739
如果柜子还在，我会关6小时 检讨我有多让你失望

334
00:11:36,374 --> 00:11:41,107
...l'd get in it for six hours and think about how l let you down.

335
00:11:45,817 --> 00:11:46,806
What?

336
00:11:47,485 --> 00:11:48,850
我们有一个箱子

337
00:11:47,552 --> 00:11:48,712
We got a box.

338
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,088
l remember the last time l saw you.

339
00:11:52,957 --> 00:11:57,087
我记得上次见到你 是去外地念书的早上

340
00:11:55,393 --> 00:11:57,623
lt was the morning l left for college.

341
00:11:58,463 --> 00:12:00,829
你站在乳品店外面

342
00:11:58,496 --> 00:12:00,930
You were standing outside the Dairy Queen.

343
00:12:02,133 --> 00:12:04,829
Just probably waiting for it to open.

344
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,824
八成是在等它开店

345
00:12:05,837 --> 00:12:09,295
-You look great now. -You look great too.

346
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:09,235
你现在好漂亮 你也很帅

347
00:12:09,774 --> 00:12:11,765
You're an excellent patient.

348
00:12:09,841 --> 00:12:11,240
你真是个好病人

349
00:12:12,844 --> 00:12:13,833
How does it look?

350
00:12:12,977 --> 00:12:14,342
情况如何？

351
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:18,174
You have a scratch on your cornea. You have to wear a patch.

352
00:12:14,445 --> 00:12:18,404
你的角膜有刮伤 得戴几天眼罩

353
00:12:18,483 --> 00:12:20,178
Like a pirate?

354
00:12:18,516 --> 00:12:19,847
像海盗那样？

355
00:12:20,952 --> 00:12:22,647
lf that helps you.

356
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,245
你懂就好

357
00:12:26,991 --> 00:12:29,960
How long have you been working with your dad?

358
00:12:27,225 --> 00:12:29,193
你跟着你爸多久了？

359
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:33,259
Come on, one of us had to mention him.

360
00:12:31,129 --> 00:12:32,790
总得有人提到他

361
00:12:34,098 --> 00:12:36,589
l moved back here a couple months ago.

362
00:12:34,198 --> 00:12:36,257
我是2个月前搬回来的

363
00:12:37,602 --> 00:12:39,263
晚上要家庭聚餐？

364
00:12:37,669 --> 00:12:40,103
Big family dinner tonight?

365
00:12:41,205 --> 00:12:42,832
No way!

366
00:12:41,372 --> 00:12:42,430
不会吧

367
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,669
l was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend's.

368
00:12:43,174 --> 00:12:45,142
我本来要去女朋友家吃饭

369
00:12:45,943 --> 00:12:47,137
但我们分手了
But we broke up.

370
00:12:49,947 --> 00:12:52,711
She wasn't ready for a serious commitment.

371
00:12:50,448 --> 00:12:52,279
她还不想定下来

372
00:12:55,286 --> 00:12:58,255
So you made her walk the plank, aye, matey?

373
00:12:55,453 --> 00:12:57,512
所以你让她跳海吃自己？

374
00:12:59,424 --> 00:13:00,948
You're not wearing the patch yet.

375
00:12:59,457 --> 00:13:01,084
你还没戴眼罩呢

376
00:13:04,429 --> 00:13:06,056
l know.

377
00:13:04,495 --> 00:13:05,427
我知道

378
00:13:11,636 --> 00:13:13,365
他要来过感恩节？

379
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:14,761
-He's coming here for Thanksgiving? -l know. lt's sick.

380
00:13:13,471 --> 00:13:15,166
对啊，好变态喔

381
00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:17,801
-Why is it sick? -lt's Richard's son!

382
00:13:15,273 --> 00:13:18,208
为什么变态？ 因为他是理查的儿子

383
00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:21,911
lt's like inviting a Greek tragedy over for dinner.

384
00:13:18,309 --> 00:13:20,869
这跟找希腊悲剧来吃饭一样

385
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,611
lf it were Greek, l'd be blind in both eyes.

386
00:13:22,647 --> 00:13:24,478
希腊人会把两只眼睛都蒙住

387
00:13:26,117 --> 00:13:31,054
l like him because he's handsome and he's nice and smart and handsome.

388
00:13:26,284 --> 00:13:31,085
我喜欢他的英俊、体帖 聪明和…英俊

389
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:35,158
Phoebe, you understand, don't you?

390
00:13:32,857 --> 00:13:34,552
菲比，你了解吧？

391
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,521
我知道你为什么指望我 但是不行
l could see where l'd be your best shot, but no.

392
00:13:39,597 --> 00:13:42,259
Sorry, honey. l think it's twisted.

393
00:13:39,897 --> 00:13:41,592
对不起，我觉得很畸形

394
00:13:42,467 --> 00:13:45,300
什么事畸形？ 我跟理查的儿子交往

395
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:45,263
-What's twisted? -Me going out with Richard's son.

396
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,103
好恶！

397
00:13:48,439 --> 00:13:49,531
恶恶恶

398
00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:53,268
lt sounds like a really bad idea to me.

399
00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:53,436
我觉得实在不太好

400
00:13:56,114 --> 00:13:59,948
-ls he okay in there? -He's fine!

401
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,544
他这样可以吗？ 他好得很

402
00:14:00,551 --> 00:14:03,349
lf things work out between you and Richard's son...

403
00:14:00,585 --> 00:14:05,249
要是你跟理查的儿子有结果 你就可以告诉孩子

404
00:14:03,554 --> 00:14:05,181
...you can tell your kids...

405
00:14:05,356 --> 00:14:06,880
你跟他们的爷爷上过床

406
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,881
...that you slept with their grandfather.

407
00:14:09,627 --> 00:14:11,356
随你们怎么批评

408
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:11,126
Judge all you want to.

409
00:14:11,396 --> 00:14:13,694
Married a lesbian, left a man at the altar...

410
00:14:11,462 --> 00:14:15,125
娶到女同志，临阵逃婚 爱上同性恋冰上舞者

411
00:14:13,965 --> 00:14:15,432
...loved a gay ice dancer...

412
00:14:15,233 --> 00:14:17,531
把女生的木腿丢进火里 睡在箱子里

413
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,694
...threw a girl's wooden leg in the fire, live in a box!

414
00:14:25,643 --> 00:14:29,602
睡箱子的用意到底何在？ 钱德

415
00:14:25,676 --> 00:14:28,736
What exactly is the point of the box?

416
00:14:31,516 --> 00:14:34,110
The meaning of the box is threefold.

417
00:14:31,616 --> 00:14:34,107
有三重意义

418
00:14:34,619 --> 00:14:38,988
第一，让我有时间反省

419
00:14:34,685 --> 00:14:38,746
One, it gives me the time to think about what l did.

420
00:14:39,123 --> 00:14:43,890
Two, it proves how much l care about my friendship with Joey.

421
00:14:39,257 --> 00:14:43,990
第二，证明我有多重视 跟乔伊的友谊

422
00:14:44,562 --> 00:14:46,052
And three...

423
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:48,030
第三…会痛

424
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:49,393
...it hurts.

425
00:14:50,401 --> 00:14:52,995
And if he stays in the box you guys will be friends again?

426
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:53,368
他关在里面，你们就能和好？

427
00:14:53,371 --> 00:14:55,965
Let's just say it's a start.

428
00:14:53,538 --> 00:14:54,937
这是个开始

429
00:14:56,441 --> 00:15:00,605
Remember that necklace l gave you last year?

430
00:14:58,576 --> 00:15:02,068
记得我去年送你的项链吗？ 可以给我看吗？

431
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:02,439
Can l see it?

432
00:15:03,214 --> 00:15:04,511
Why?

433
00:15:03,381 --> 00:15:06,316
为什么？ 我只是想看一下

434
00:15:04,849 --> 00:15:07,044
l just want to check something.

435
00:15:07,485 --> 00:15:08,952
Okay.

436
00:15:07,685 --> 00:15:08,583
好

437
00:15:12,256 --> 00:15:13,689
Now we'll see.

438
00:15:12,557 --> 00:15:13,751
等着瞧吧

439
00:15:13,925 --> 00:15:16,416
Air hole! Air hole!

440
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,752
没气了！没气了

441
00:15:18,262 --> 00:15:21,425
Here it is. l love it. l wear it all the time.

442
00:15:18,663 --> 00:15:20,597
在这里，我很喜欢，我常戴

443
00:15:24,769 --> 00:15:28,296
我送的是金项链，这是银的

444
00:15:24,802 --> 00:15:27,965
The necklace l got you was gold. This is silver.

445
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,642
Well, maybe...

446
00:15:31,342 --> 00:15:34,573
也许它…变色了

447
00:15:33,644 --> 00:15:35,043
...it changed.

448
00:15:35,913 --> 00:15:38,711
Oh, my God! You actually exchanged it.

449
00:15:36,147 --> 00:15:38,672
天哪，你真的拿去换

450
00:15:38,783 --> 00:15:44,119
换一个我喜欢又常用的东西 不是比较好？

451
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:42,113
lsn't it better to exchange it for something l enjoy...

452
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,651
...and can use a lot?

453
00:15:44,055 --> 00:15:45,613
What did you get?

454
00:15:44,222 --> 00:15:46,656
你换了什么？ 换购金额

455
00:15:45,823 --> 00:15:47,450
Credit.

456
00:15:50,094 --> 00:15:53,530
l'll get it. l'll get it. l'll get it. l'll get it. l'll get it.

457
00:15:50,127 --> 00:15:53,585
我来开我来开…

458
00:15:57,235 --> 00:15:58,497
Hi, Tim.

459
00:15:57,401 --> 00:15:58,333
提姆

460
00:15:59,036 --> 00:16:02,199
Thank you. Come meet my friends.

461
00:15:59,136 --> 00:16:01,400
谢谢，来见我的朋友

462
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:05,202
这是菲比 幸会

463
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,099
Phoebe.

464
00:16:05,343 --> 00:16:06,605
And Joey.

465
00:16:05,443 --> 00:16:06,740
乔伊 你好

466
00:16:06,844 --> 00:16:08,436
My brother, Ross.

467
00:16:07,011 --> 00:16:08,569
我哥哥罗斯 你好

468
00:16:08,713 --> 00:16:10,271
And Rachel.

469
00:16:08,746 --> 00:16:09,770
还有瑞秋

470
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:14,718
That's Chandler.

471
00:16:13,351 --> 00:16:15,683
那是钱德 你好

472
00:16:14,952 --> 00:16:16,419
How do you do?

473
00:16:18,356 --> 00:16:20,620
-What's--? -Well, he's....

474
00:16:18,489 --> 00:16:20,616
这是… 他在…

475
00:16:20,725 --> 00:16:22,249
他在反省

476
00:16:20,858 --> 00:16:23,088
He's doing some thinking.

477
00:16:28,566 --> 00:16:31,592
-What happened? -You kissed my girlfriend!

478
00:16:28,766 --> 00:16:31,030
怎么了？ 你亲了我的女朋友

479
00:16:36,274 --> 00:16:37,536
l like those sunglasses.

480
00:16:36,641 --> 00:16:37,699
我喜欢那个墨镜

481
00:16:38,109 --> 00:16:43,240
''Like them'' like them? Or ''l'd like to get store credit'' like them?

482
00:16:38,342 --> 00:16:41,709
是喜欢的喜欢 还是可以换成换购金额的喜欢

483
00:16:44,715 --> 00:16:46,307
（意大利文）

484
00:16:49,787 --> 00:16:52,255
各位，火鸡上桌了

485
00:16:49,954 --> 00:16:52,047
This turkey is ready.

486
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,219
Where can l wash up?

487
00:16:52,657 --> 00:16:55,751
哪里可以洗手？ 来…我带你去

488
00:16:54,992 --> 00:16:56,254
Let me show you.

489
00:16:56,727 --> 00:16:58,490
The towels are hanging next to the sink.

490
00:16:56,827 --> 00:16:58,692
毛巾挂在洗手旁边

491
00:16:58,863 --> 00:17:01,730
-And you can use the fancy soap. -Thank you.

492
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,730
你可以用高级香皂 谢谢

493
00:17:02,867 --> 00:17:05,734
高级香皂？ 我以为要留给教宗用

494
00:17:02,934 --> 00:17:06,563
Fancy soap? l thought we were saving that for the pope.

495
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:09,668
See. He's nice, right?

496
00:17:08,072 --> 00:17:09,437
他人很好吧？

497
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:13,476
但你真的想在谈恋爱时说

498
00:17:09,907 --> 00:17:13,035
Do you want a relationship where you can actually say:

499
00:17:13,277 --> 00:17:15,939
''That's not how your dad used to do it''?

500
00:17:13,578 --> 00:17:15,102
“你爸的做法不同”？

501
00:17:20,585 --> 00:17:23,247
Everything looks great. Where should l sit?

502
00:17:21,385 --> 00:17:24,377
看起来好好吃，我坐哪里？ 我帮你留了

503
00:17:23,454 --> 00:17:24,443
Saved you a seat.

504
00:17:25,556 --> 00:17:27,421
Sick, sick, sick, sick.

505
00:17:25,756 --> 00:17:27,383
变态变态变态变态

506
00:17:29,727 --> 00:17:31,217
l'll get it.

507
00:17:29,827 --> 00:17:30,759
我去开

508
00:17:31,562 --> 00:17:33,223
Got you!

509
00:17:31,762 --> 00:17:32,694
被我骗了

510
00:17:35,733 --> 00:17:38,224
That doesn't sound like thinking to me.

511
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,733
这听起来不像是反省

512
00:17:39,103 --> 00:17:42,038
-Sorry! -You shouldn't be talking at all.

513
00:17:39,403 --> 00:17:42,167
对不起 你不应该说话

514
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:45,402
You've got too much thinking to do to be talking and joking.

515
00:17:42,273 --> 00:17:45,436
你要想的太多了 不该说话开玩笑

516
00:17:45,743 --> 00:17:47,233
好，没问题
Okay, you got it!

517
00:17:47,612 --> 00:17:49,375
Ross, pass me the yams?

518
00:17:47,745 --> 00:17:48,905
罗斯，把蕃薯给我

519
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:53,514
好，你想换的话 乔伊那里有马铃薯泥

520
00:17:50,114 --> 00:17:54,210
Joey's got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.

521
00:17:58,055 --> 00:18:00,285
Will you stop! What's the matter with you?

522
00:17:58,122 --> 00:18:00,590
够了，你是怎么搞的？

523
00:18:00,925 --> 00:18:03,155
We've got company.

524
00:18:01,158 --> 00:18:02,318
有客人喔

525
00:18:04,595 --> 00:18:06,392
Nothing's the matter with me.

526
00:18:04,729 --> 00:18:06,128
我没怎么搞的

527
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:10,496
我不是麻木不仁的人 我也有感觉

528
00:18:06,564 --> 00:18:10,557
l'm not completely devoid of sentiment. l have feelings.

529
00:18:11,369 --> 00:18:13,599
Okay, fine.

530
00:18:11,602 --> 00:18:12,830
好，很好

531
00:18:19,143 --> 00:18:23,375
You can't tell, but l'm breaking the tension by mooning you guys.

532
00:18:19,276 --> 00:18:22,734
你们看不到 但我正在露屁股打圆场

533
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,915
All right, look!

534
00:18:29,587 --> 00:18:30,519
听着

535
00:18:31,255 --> 00:18:34,088
lf this is a big joke to you, forget about it.

536
00:18:31,355 --> 00:18:34,324
如果你把它当成笑话 那就算了

537
00:18:34,325 --> 00:18:36,316
This means something to me.

538
00:18:34,425 --> 00:18:35,790
这对我很重要

539
00:18:36,527 --> 00:18:39,462
lf it doesn't mean anything to you, then get out of there.

540
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,929
要是对你不重要，你就死出来 否则就太白痴了

541
00:18:39,664 --> 00:18:41,894
Otherwise, you're just an idiot in a box.

542
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,697
You're right. l'm sorry. This means a lot to me.

543
00:18:42,667 --> 00:18:43,759
你说得对，对不起

544
00:18:43,868 --> 00:18:47,269
这对我非常重要 我想跟你和解

545
00:18:45,903 --> 00:18:50,237
l want to be friends again. l swear l won't say another word.

546
00:18:47,371 --> 00:18:49,737
我发誓不会再说话了

547
00:18:51,075 --> 00:18:53,771
-So you'll take this seriously? -Absolutely!

548
00:18:51,175 --> 00:18:53,871
你会当一回事？ 绝对会

549
00:18:53,978 --> 00:18:55,912
你又说话罗

550
00:18:54,111 --> 00:18:56,341
That sounds like another word to me.

551
00:18:57,348 --> 00:18:59,612
Are you going to take this seriously?

552
00:18:57,381 --> 00:18:59,372
你会当一回事吗？

553
00:19:03,621 --> 00:19:05,054
Okay!

554
00:19:03,788 --> 00:19:04,812
很好

555
00:19:07,124 --> 00:19:10,025
Don't say that l have no sentiment.

556
00:19:07,324 --> 00:19:09,724
别说我麻木不仁

557
00:19:10,928 --> 00:19:13,829
这是第一次约会的电影票根

558
00:19:10,995 --> 00:19:13,930
This is a movie stub from our first date.

559
00:19:14,165 --> 00:19:18,101
This eggshell is from the first time you made me breakfast in bed.

560
00:19:14,331 --> 00:19:18,324
这是你第一次 为我做床上早餐的蛋壳

561
00:19:18,703 --> 00:19:22,833
This is from the museum, the first time we...

562
00:19:18,736 --> 00:19:21,933
这是博物馆的，我们第一次…

563
00:19:23,107 --> 00:19:24,540
...were together.

564
00:19:23,207 --> 00:19:24,367
在一起

565
00:19:25,443 --> 00:19:30,346
Maybe l exchange gifts sometimes, but l keep the things that matter.

566
00:19:25,609 --> 00:19:29,636
我有时会换礼物 但重要的东西我会留

567
00:19:31,649 --> 00:19:33,947
l don't know what to say. l'm sorry.

568
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:33,441
我不知道该说什么，对不起

569
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:38,855
但是…这个不能拿

570
00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:39,012
Though you're not supposed to take these.

571
00:19:42,626 --> 00:19:44,560
lt's, like, a million years old.

572
00:19:42,727 --> 00:19:45,025
它有百万年的历史

573
00:19:45,563 --> 00:19:49,897
We actually have people looking for that.

574
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:48,722
我们还得派专人去挖

575
00:19:56,073 --> 00:19:59,133
-Mind if l smoke? -Care if l die?

576
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,467
我可以抽烟吗？ 想害死我吗？

577
00:19:59,276 --> 00:20:03,042
No, l'm just kidding, l'm just kidding. Go ahead, smoke.

578
00:20:00,244 --> 00:20:01,939
开玩笑的，你抽吧

579
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,738
This always happens.

580
00:20:03,914 --> 00:20:06,405
老是会卡住 让我来

581
00:20:05,349 --> 00:20:06,782
Here, let me.

582
00:20:07,351 --> 00:20:08,841
Thank you.

583
00:20:07,518 --> 00:20:08,450
谢谢

584
00:20:12,389 --> 00:20:14,357
You have very beautiful...

585
00:20:12,523 --> 00:20:15,981
你的眼睛…很漂亮

586
00:20:15,192 --> 00:20:16,784
...eye.

587
00:20:18,696 --> 00:20:20,391
My friends think this is weird.

588
00:20:18,829 --> 00:20:22,424
我朋友都觉得这样很怪 包括箱子里那个？

589
00:20:21,065 --> 00:20:23,431
Even the one in the box?

590
00:20:24,301 --> 00:20:25,461
lt's not weird, is it?

591
00:20:24,568 --> 00:20:25,967
这样不会很怪吧？

592
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:30,163
l thought it would be. l almost canceled, but it really isn't.

593
00:20:26,403 --> 00:20:30,806
我原先也觉得会，还差点取消 但其实不会

594
00:20:30,674 --> 00:20:34,075
l know. Me and your dad, that's totally separate.

595
00:20:30,941 --> 00:20:34,900
我知道 我跟你爸完全是两回事

596
00:20:34,345 --> 00:20:36,279
l totally agree.

597
00:20:35,012 --> 00:20:35,910
我完全同意

598
00:20:36,881 --> 00:20:43,081
我们只是两个…互相吸引的人 对吧？

599
00:20:37,047 --> 00:20:39,572
We're two people who find each other...

600
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,918
...very attractive.

601
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:43,609
Right?

602
00:20:54,532 --> 00:20:57,592
-What? -Nothing, nothing.

603
00:20:54,698 --> 00:20:56,962
怎么了？ 没事

604
00:20:57,935 --> 00:21:00,631
No, really. Was that not okay?

605
00:20:58,502 --> 00:21:02,836
那个吻不好吗？ 不，很好

606
00:21:00,871 --> 00:21:02,133
No, that was good.

607
00:21:02,873 --> 00:21:04,864
That was a good kiss.

608
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,567
那个吻很好

609
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:09,273
-lt reminded you of-- -Don't say it!

610
00:21:06,343 --> 00:21:08,971
天哪！它让你想到… 别说

611
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,105
-lt did, didn't it? -Yes!

612
00:21:10,347 --> 00:21:11,678
但是有，对吧？ 对！

613
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,510
天哪！ 我知道

614
00:21:13,417 --> 00:21:14,645
l know!

615
00:21:17,454 --> 00:21:21,083
God, l am sorry. l am so sorry.

616
00:21:17,721 --> 00:21:20,690
对不起，我真的很抱歉

617
00:21:21,225 --> 00:21:26,253
lt's okay. lt wouldn't be Thanksgiving without a little emotional scarring.

618
00:21:21,358 --> 00:21:25,021
没关系 少了感情疮疤就不叫感恩节

619
00:21:27,131 --> 00:21:29,190
You know what's even worse?

620
00:21:27,398 --> 00:21:30,799
更糟的是，我朋友说得对

621
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:30,857
My friends were right.

622
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:36,962
You know what's worst for me is you remind me of a younger version of my mom.

623
00:21:31,035 --> 00:21:36,029
最糟的是 我觉得你就像年轻的我妈

624
00:21:59,396 --> 00:22:02,923
-l want you to know how sorry l am-- -lt's okay.

625
00:21:59,597 --> 00:22:02,430
听着，我真的很抱歉… 没关系

626
00:22:03,033 --> 00:22:04,694
我气的是钱德

627
00:22:03,133 --> 00:22:07,661
-Chandler's the one l'm mad at. -Well, l'm still sorry.

628
00:22:05,703 --> 00:22:07,466
我还是很抱歉

629
00:22:08,672 --> 00:22:11,505
-ls he here? -ln the box.

630
00:22:08,873 --> 00:22:11,398
他在吗？ 在箱子里

631
00:22:19,717 --> 00:22:22,515
钱德？ 他现在不能说话

632
00:22:20,684 --> 00:22:23,175
He can't talk right now.

633
00:22:24,054 --> 00:22:25,544
Why not? What's going on?

634
00:22:24,455 --> 00:22:25,979
为什么？怎么了？

635
00:22:25,923 --> 00:22:28,687
He's trying to show Joey how much he means to him.

636
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:28,718
他想表示他很重视乔伊

637
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,954
-By being in a box? -Joey had reasons.

638
00:22:29,994 --> 00:22:33,054
所以窝在箱子里？ 乔伊有他的理由

639
00:22:34,632 --> 00:22:35,929
They were threefold.

640
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:35,992
有三重意义

641
00:22:41,305 --> 00:22:45,799
You not being able to talk might make this easier.

642
00:22:41,538 --> 00:22:44,701
你不能说话反而让事情好办

643
00:22:46,043 --> 00:22:47,943
Listen....

644
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,441
听我说…

645
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:03,084
听我说 我不想介入两个最要好的朋友

646
00:22:58,022 --> 00:23:02,959
l don't want to be someone who comes between two best friends.

647
00:23:04,361 --> 00:23:07,956
l can't stand seeing what this is doing to you guys.

648
00:23:04,528 --> 00:23:10,160
我不忍心看着这件事影响你们 我不想成为罪魁祸首

649
00:23:08,399 --> 00:23:11,163
And l don't want to be the cause of that.

650
00:23:10,668 --> 00:23:14,729
所以我们不该再见面了

651
00:23:12,369 --> 00:23:14,667
l don't think we can see each other anymore.

652
00:23:15,906 --> 00:23:18,238
l'm going to my mom's in Chicago.

l think this could have been something really amazing.

656
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,844
这段感情本来会很美好

657
00:23:30,087 --> 00:23:34,217
But, you know, this is probably for the best.

658
00:23:30,154 --> 00:23:34,090
但这么做最好

659
00:23:34,992 --> 00:23:36,721
You know?

660
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:36,183
