He can't come. He's stuck in Chicago.

You have a very impressive resume, Miss Greene.

107
00:06:34,89 --> 00:06:39,02
Filing system? Those colored labels you put on all the folders?
“档案管理系统”？ 你说资料夹上黏的彩色标签啊

108
00:06:39,23 --> 00:06:41,66
It did brighten up the filing cabinets.
那的确是让档案柜生色不少

109
00:06:44,73 --> 00:06:46,83
They did more than that.

I notice you've been entrusted with a lot of important responsibilities.

Rachel has been incredible at getting my bagels.

Of course, I have more responsibilities than that.

Of course! There's the coffee too.

Rachel can carry two things at once.

Now a big part of this job is...

-Yes, l -She shouldn't have any problem.

121
00:07:26,77 --> 00:07:30,23
Her only problem might be getting too friendly, you know?

122
00:07:31,65 --> 00:07:33,38
I love working with designers.

123
00:07:33,58 --> 00:07:36,55
With them. Under them. What's the difference?

124
00:07:42,59 --> 00:07:44,56
My first review is out.

我会再光顾“亚历山卓”吗？ 当然，但我会点两份餐

129
00:07:58,61 --> 00:08:02,13
One for me, and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head."
一份给自己 一份给拿枪抵着我的人

130
00:08:02,84 --> 00:08:05,24
You really laid into this place.
你真把这家店批得一文不值

131
00:08:05,45 --> 00:08:08,44
They don't pay me a penny a word to make friends.
报社付我钱 可不是要我广结善缘

132
00:08:08,65 --> 00:08:12,02
I found a guy who'd fix up the van for catering.
我得走了，我找到一个人 他能搞定那部外烩厢型车

133
00:08:12,22 --> 00:08:13,24
You want me to go?
要我一起去吗？

134
00:08:13,45 --> 00:08:16,62
It's okay. Are we sure we don't want the waterbed?
不用了，没关系 但你确定我们不要那张水床？

135
00:08:18,79 --> 00:08:23,53
Because it would be silly to take it out if we're just gonna put it back in again.
如果拿下来又要放回去 那不是很蠢吗？

136
00:08:23,80 --> 00:08:25,49
Haven't we made this decision?
我们不是早就说好了？

137
00:08:25,90 --> 00:08:28,03
Yeah, all right.
对啦，算了

138
00:08:28,80 --> 00:08:30,57
再见 再见

139
00:08:36,54 --> 00:08:40,04
-Who is it? -It's Allesandro, from Allesandro's.
谁啊？ 我是亚历山卓的老板

140
00:08:42,98 --> 00:08:46,55

You guys want coffees?
你们要喝咖啡吗？ 对

I don't want to be up too late, so I'll have a decaf.
但我今天想早点睡 所以我要无咖啡因的

280
00:16:39,69 --> 00:16:41,13
Yeah, me too.

281

Actually, could I get some hot water with lemon?
我能来杯热水加点莱姆汁吗？

282
00:16:46,37 --> 00:16:50,83
I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?
我刚才在那家店里都喊到哑了 他们音乐非要开那么大声吗？

283
00:16:51,91 --> 00:16:55,07
I can't hear a word. My ears are ringing so bad.
我听不到你说什么 我耳鸣得厉害

284
00:16:55,31 --> 00:16:57,78
I was glad I had that extra pair of socks.
幸好我多带了一双袜子

285
00:16:57,98 --> 00:16:59,34
I used them as mittens.
拿来当手套用

286
00:16:59,55 --> 00:17:02,54
I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place.
最后那家店脏到我不敢用手碰

287
00:17:06,55 --> 00:17:08,42
How sad are we?

I'm 29 years old, damn it!

...and go to sleep at a reasonable hour.

294
00:17:23,90 --> 00:17:28,57
I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.
我喜欢去安静一点的地方 才能好好跟朋友聊天

295
00:17:28,88 --> 00:17:33,61
And so what if I like to go home, put on Kenny G and take a bath?
就算回家听肯尼吉的音乐洗澡 又有什么大不了？

296
00:17:37,42 --> 00:17:40,08
We're 29. We're not women.
我们是29岁没错 但我们可不是娘儿们

297
00:17:48,03 --> 00:17:49,36
There you are.

298
00:17:50,26 --> 00:17:52,86
I'm glad you decided to hear me out.

I've been doing a lot of thinking.

I came up with a bunch of businesses that you can do with your van.

304
00:18:09,32 --> 00:18:12,01
或是送面包？

305
00:18:12,45 --> 00:18:14,39
Pizza?

I got a whole bunch of stuff in this area.

I guess if you don't want to deliver...

...you probably don't want to pick up stuff either.
八成也不会想去载货

312

Let's do the catering business.

Is Joanna in already?

-Heard what? -Joanna...

333
00:19:51,79 --> 00:19:53,28

Oh, my God! How?

I didn't realize that you were so close.

342
00:20:16,34 --> 00:20:19,18
Yes. So close!
对，好到不行 （亦指：就差那么一点点）

343
00:20:21,78 --> 00:20:26,91
I know that this is an emotional and difficult time for all of us.
林区太太，我知道这个节骨眼 大家在情绪上都很煎熬

...send any paperwork your way before...
乔安娜是不是正好有…

346
00:20:31,63 --> 00:20:35,08
把人事调动公文交给你？

347
00:20:33,63 --> 00:20:37,06
-...it happened? -No, nothing.

348
00:20:35,23 --> 00:20:37,09
完全没有

349
00:20:37,46 --> 00:20:43,40
Imagine, if she'd just stepped off that curb a few seconds later.
只盼当初…

350
00:20:39,10 --> 00:20:42,80
她晚个几秒钟过街就没事了

00:20:43,70 --> 00:20:47,20
Yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us.
对，差个几秒钟 她就还能跟我们在一起

352
00:20:47,44 --> 00:20:49,43
Nothing about an assistant buyer?

虽然开除艾米里欧主厨 让我觉得很过意不去

359
00:21:13,70 --> 00:21:16,36
It is like losing a member of the family.
那就像是失去了一个家人

360
00:21:16,67 --> 00:21:20,73
Of course, that literally is the case for several of you.

361
00:21:22,38 --> 00:21:25,04
Tony, Carlos, Marie...
东尼、卡洛斯、玛莉…

362
00:21:25,28 --> 00:21:29,27
...please tell your father how much we're going to miss him.
请向令尊转达 我们会有多想念艾米里欧

363
00:21:30,62 --> 00:21:34,78
I know Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place.
我知道摩妮卡对这家店 有许多很棒的点子

364
00:21:35,02 --> 00:21:38,05
Well, you all read the review.
你们都看过她那篇评论了

365
00:21:38,29 --> 00:21:40,62
So without much further ado...
所以废话不多说

366
00:21:40,83 --> 00:21:44,79
...I present to you our new head chef.

370
00:22:05,85 --> 00:22:08,01
Are you going to kill me?
