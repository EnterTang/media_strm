1
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,430
我们走运了
We are so in luck!

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:08,230
房东说这些好东西都可以给我们
Treeger said we could have all this cool stuff!

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,730
等一下
Wait right there.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,800
不行，我要划走了
Oh,no. I'm paddling away.

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,310
真的？ 这些生锈的垃圾不要钱？
Really? We got all this rusty crap for free?

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:26,050
还有一堆泡泡棉 有些完全没挤过
This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And some of it is not even popped.

7
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,000
我们真是穷苦的白人吗？
Could we be more white trash?

8
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,960
本集播出：“爱的手铐”

大卫修蒙

15
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,840
我真是绝望透了
How desperate am l?

16
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:30,120
幸好钱德不在，谁也惨不过他
Good thing Chandler's not here. He always wins at this game.

17
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,120
我刚答应帮我妈办宴会
I just told my mom I'd cater her party.

18
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,250
为什么？
-How come?

19
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,650
因为我需要钱
-I need the money.

20
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,760
而且这样正好可以抛开 最后一丝自尊
It'd be a great way to get rid of that last smidgen of self-respect.

21
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,560
别这样，这是好事啊
I think this is a good thing.

22
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,660
要不是觉得你行，妈不会找你 
Mom wouldn't have hired you if you weren't good.

23
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,570
你不必替她说话，她听不到
You don't have to stick up for her. She can't hear you.

24
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,770
你们有果汁吗？
Do you have any juice?

25
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,070
只有腌黄瓜汁
Just pickle.

26
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,940
瑞秋，说来好笑 我昨天在路上遇见乔安娜
Funny story. I bumped into Joanna yesterday.

27
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,320
我的上司乔安娜？一定很尴尬
My boss,Joanna? That must have been awkward.

28
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,020
事实上她找我一起去喝酒
Actually,she asked me if I wanted a drink.

29
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:14,160
你没有答应吧？
You didn't say yes to that,did you?

30
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,960
没有
No,No

31
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,590
瑞秋
Hello,Rachel.

32
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,970
一开始没答应
Well,not at first.

33
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,500
她在这里干什么？
What is she doing here?

34
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,220
我不懂 你上次跟她约会时说她很无聊
Last time you went out with her you said she was a dud!

35
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,720
我太快下定论了 这次我们进展到下一个阶段
I judged her too quickly. This time,we took it to the next level.

36
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:49,790
我上次差点被炒鱿鱼 你马上给我做个了结
Last time I almost got fired. You must end it. You must end it now.

37
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,590
这可不是每天都有的事
It's not an everyday occurrence!

38
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,400
通常我都一个人睡
Usually I'm in there by myself.

39
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,400
钱德！答应我…
Promise.

40
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,450
瑞秋，你快迟到了吧？ 没有啊
-Rachel,aren't you running late? -No

41
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,610
有，你还要帮我买焙果 好
-You are if you pick me up a bagel. -Okay.

42
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,550
钱德，答应我跟她分手
Promise you will end this now.

43
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,450
好，我会跟她分手 谢谢
-I promise. I'll end it. -Thank you.

44
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,290
不过我的牺牲很大
I hope you know what I'm giving up.

45
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:22,690
她可不只是你的上司，懂吗？
She's not just the boss in your office. You know what I mean?

46
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,700
对不起，我懂他的意思
Sorry. I knew what he meant.

47
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,440
雇工忙得怎样？
How's the hired help?

48
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,040
很顺利，乳酪火腿馅饼快好了
Doing great. Quiches are coming along.

49
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,010
这是什么？蓝色指甲油？
What's this? Blue nail polish?

50
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,710
对，我觉得很好看
I thought it was cute.

51
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,580
当我们找到你外婆时她的指甲就是这个颜色
It's what your grandmother's hands looked like when we found her.

52
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,860
我问你一个问题
Let me ask you a question.

53
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,690
你为什么雇我？
Why did you hire me?

54
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,290
理查一直说他的派对餐点很棒
Richard raved about the food at his party...

55
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,090
但你当时在跟他上床
...but you were sleeping with him.

56
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,730
后来我听说 那场同志婚礼的菜很好
Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was nice.

57
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,240
你应该没跟那些人上床吧
I assume you didn't sleep with anyone there.

58
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,430
否则起码很特别
At least that would be something.

59
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,680
天哪！你听到了吗？
Oh,my God! Did you hear that?

60
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,910
她是觉得我很行才雇我
She hired me because she thinks I'm good.

61
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,510
我没听到这个
I didn't hear that.

62
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,820
她不是在可怜我
She didn't hire me out of pity.

63
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,230
不是想在朋友面前刁难我 她是真的觉得我行
It wasn't so she could pick on me. She actually thinks I'm good.

64
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,820
还有，如果你是同志就太酷了
And hey,it's cool if you're a lesbian.

65
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,180
午安，你是这里的家长吗？
Good afternoon. Are you the decision-maker of the house?

66
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,990
你目前拥有一套百科全书吗？
Do you currently own a set of encyclopedias?

67
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:04,000
没有 不过分类广告上什么都有
No,but try the classifieds. People sell everything in there.

68
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,260
我不是要买，我是要卖
Actually,I'm not buying. I'm selling.

69
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,630
我问你一个问题
Let me ask you one question.

70
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,400
你是否曾在朋友们聊天时
Do your friends ever have a conversation...

71
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:17,470
只能跟着点头 却搞不懂他们在说什么？
...and you just nod along,not sure what they're talking about?

72
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:26,910
告诉你，这根本是违宪 没错
I'm telling you,it's totally unconstitutional.

73
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,250
我觉得他应该得诺贝尔奖
I think he deserves a Nobel Prize.

74
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,390
才怪
No

75
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,060
很像阿尔冈昆族（印第安部族）小孩的桌子
It was like the Algonquin kids' table.

76
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,460
抱歉，对不起
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

77
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:46,170
你发了大约2分半钟的呆
You haven't said anything for about two minutes.

78
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,640
你到底有没有兴趣？
Are you at all interested?

79
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,810
有…请进
Come on in.

80
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,820
怪了 什么？
-That's weird. -What?

81
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,150
你的假指甲
Your nails.

82
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,590
我知道，我带了假指甲怕咬指甲被我妈唠叨
I wore fake ones so my mom wouldn't give me grief about biting them.

83
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:06,020
我是说你现在只有九个指甲
I meant,it's weird that you only have nine now.

84
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,560
天哪
Oh,my God!

85
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,260
等一下
Wait a minute.

86
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,100
我之前要烤…
I had them when I put

87
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,700
天哪，在馅饼里面
Oh,my God! It's in the quiche!

88
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,440
完了！ 好，不要慌
-Oh,my God! -Okay,don't panic.

89
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,810
我去帮你买一组新指甲
I'll go buy you a new set of nails.

90
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,070
没有人会知道，你还是很美
No one will know,and you'll look great!

91
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,420
噢，你是怕他们会吃到
It's because they're going to eat That's the problem.

92
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,480
女儿，别咬指甲
Honey,don't bite your nails.

93
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,560
你别生气
Please don't freak out.

94
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,620
不过某个馅饼里有一片假指甲
There's a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups.

95
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:46,430
而且无从找起
And there's no way to know which one.

96
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,100
找到的人可以中大奖
And whoever finds it wins the prize!

97
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,870
我不会生气
I'm not freaking out.

98
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,910
你在笑什么？ 没事，你爸输我5块钱
-Why are you laughing? -Now your father owes me $5.

99
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,310
你赌我会掉指甲？
You bet I'd lose a nail?

100
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,610
别傻了 我只是赌我会用上这个
Don't be silly. I just bet that I'd need these.

101
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,480
冷冻意大利面？
Frozen lasagnas?

102
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,480
你赌我会搞砸？
You bet that I'd screw up?

103
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,260
你还说什么我很行…
All that stuff about how I was good

104
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,120
不，那都是真的
No,that was all true.

105
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,560
这只是怕你太莫妮卡了
This was just in case you "pulled a Monica."

106
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,830
你答应心理医生不再这么说
You promised Dr. Weinberg you'd never use that phrase.

107
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,770
拜托，有点幽默感嘛
Come on. Have a sense of humor.

108
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,000
你总是不懂得自嘲
You're never able to laugh at yourself.

109
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,340
是啊
That's right.

110
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:33,410
我妈对我没信心，好好笑喔
My mom has no faith in me! That's hilarious!

111
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,010
哪里好笑？
I don't get it.

112
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,390
不，我对你有信心
No. I have faith.

113
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,510
不，你有的是意大利面
No. You have lasagnas!

114
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,890
毁掉的馅饼好了
The ruined quiches are ready!

115
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,170
我们不该这么做 好
-I really don't think we should be doing this. -Okay.

116
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,380
这种感觉不像是分手
It just doesn't feel like we're breaking up.

117
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:14,010
是分手啊，我好伤心喔
No,we are. I'm sad.

118
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,820
好吧
Okey

119
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,720
可以等到明天吗？好吧
Can you wait till tomorrow? All right.

120
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,830
不敢相信
Unbelievable!

121
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,030
谢谢
Thanks.

122
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,110
不是，我得去见我的老板 好
That was my boss. I have to go.

123
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,200
你干什么？
What are you doing?

124
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:38,140
穿衣服 为什么？
-I'm getting dressed. -Why?

125
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,370
光着屁股走在路上会被扔东西
When I walk outside naked,people throw garbage.

126
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,320
等一下，给你看个东西
Wait. I want to show you something.

127
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,050
什么东西？
What is it?

128
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,350
别人送的一个小道具
Just a little gag gift somebody gave me.

129
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,120
把手合在一起
Put your hands together.

130
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,190
你又不是我的老板
You're not the boss of me.

131
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,930
你是
Yeah,you are.

132
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,730
火辣啊
Saucy!

133
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,810
我马上回来
I'll be back in two minutes.

134
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,980
你要这样把我挂着？
You're going to leave me like this?

135
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,140
知道你在等我 感觉很令人兴奋
Knowing you're here waiting for me. I think it's exciting,don't you?

136
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,590
好，但要是你不马上回来…
If you don't come back soon...

137
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,250
我也不能怎么样
...there's pretty much nothing I can do about it!

138
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,960
我帮你带了杏仁饼回来
I brought you back a macaroon.

139
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,230
很好，我会把它帖在屁股上
Great. I'll keep it in my butt with your nose.

140
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,410
奇怪，她把门锁上了
That's weird. She locked the door.

141
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:46,710
你知道为什么？ 里面有圣诞奖金名单
You know why? She's got the bonus list in there.

142
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,980
我早上看到她在打
I saw her working on it today.

143
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,680
好，你可别说出去
Swear you won't tell.

144
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,380
马克离职时给了我一把钥匙
When Mark left,he gave me a key to her office.

145
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,220
你想看名单吗？ 想
You want to see the list?

146
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,010
你好吗？
How are you?

147
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,460
喂，乔安娜…
Hello,Joanna…

148
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,200
…的办公室
office.

149
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,240
对不起，我还要一阵子
I'm sorry. I'll be a little longer.

150
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,900
多久？ 2个小时，我急死了
-How little? -A couple hours.

151
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,440
一点也不好玩，马上给我回来
This isn't funny. Get back here now!

152
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,810
我没办法 为什么？
-I can't! -Why not?

153
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,810
我在我老板的车上
I'm in my boss' car.

154
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,680
什么？ 进隧道了
-What? -Tunnel!

155
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,560
干什么？
What?

156
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,160
瑞秋，你能进来一下吗？
Rachel,could I see you for a moment?

157
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,700
好，现在是这样
Okay,here's the situation.

158
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,980
手铐的钥匙挂在门上
The keys to the cuffs are on the door.

159
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,350
你能不能行行好
Could you be a doll...

160
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:33,320
拿了钥匙冲过来帮我解套？
...and grab them and scoot on over here and unlock me?

161
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,120
题外话：好漂亮的套装
And on a totally separate subject,that's a lovely pantsuit.

162
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,290
你答应要跟她分手的
You promised you would break up with her.

163
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,660
我跟她分手啦 只不过她分得很狂野
I did break up with her! She just took it really,really well!

164
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,440
你都没想过 这样会破坏我的事业？
Jeopardizing my career never entered your mind?

165
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,070
我想过啊
It did enter my mind.

166
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:00,050
但后来的事让这个念头飞了
But then something happened that made it shoot right out.

167
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:06,080
你害自己被铐住，就自己脱困
You got yourself into those cuffs,you get yourself out.

168
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,760
不，我没办法自己脱困
I can't get myself right out of them.

169
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,420
你把我跟“不可思议的钱德”搞混了
You must have me confused with the "Amazing Chandler"!

170
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:18,800
帮我解开，她可能要去很久 我好冷，而且…
Unlock me! She could be gone for hours,and I'm cold and....

171
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,770
钱德！好，够了
All right! This is it!

172
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,600
不准你再见她
Never see her again.

173
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:26,640
永远
Never!

174
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,900
不准再进这个办公室
-Never come in here again. 

175
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:29,940
好
-Fine!

176
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,510
把随身听还给我 我…
Give me back my Walkman!

177
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,780
我没借过
I never borrowed it.

178
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,150
那就是我弄丢了，买一台给我
Then I lost it. Buy me one!

179
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:42,290
没问题，快解开吧，太好了
You got it! Here we go! Come on. This is great!

180
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,990
会痛吗？
Does it hurt?

181
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:50,330
不，我只是看别人解开铐子时都会啊一声
No,I always see guys do this when handcuffs are taken off.

182
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,790
亲爱的裤子
Hello,sweet pants!

183
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:59,330
慢着！你要怎么跟乔安娜说？
Wait! What will you tell Joanna?

184
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,370
说什么？
About what?

185
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:04,770
她看你走了会知道是我放的 我会被解雇
She'll see you're gone and know I let you out,and I'll get fired!

186
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,140
我会撒谎，我最会撒谎了
I'll tell a lie! I'm good at lying!

187
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,150
我的确借了你的随身听
I actually did borrow your Walkman!

188
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,810
行不通的，她会知道我有钥匙
She'll know I have a key to her office.

189
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,950
我得把你铐回去
I've got to lock you back up.

190
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,250
你别想
I don't think so.

191
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,270
这样好多了
This is much better.

192
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,630
这个人很有意思
Here's somebody interesting.

193
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,800
你对梵高（画家）认识多少？
What do you know about Van Gogh?

194
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,980
他割掉自己的耳朵 还有呢？
-He cut off his ear. -And?

195
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,840
没了
I'm out.

196
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,580
这是他画的
He painted that.

197
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,120
不赖嘛
That's pretty nice.

198
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,820
我以为他割掉耳朵是因为自己画不好
I thought he cut off his ear because he sucked.

199
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,220
还有什么？ 我看看
-What else you got in there? -Let's see....

200
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,430
教皇住在哪里？ 森林里
-Where does the Pope live? -ln the woods.

201
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:01,170
等等，那是开玩笑的
Wait,that's the joke answer.

202
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,500
他住在梵蒂冈
Actually,it's Vatican City.

203
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:08,870
你知道什么是硫化橡胶？

You need these books.

206
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,080
这里是你的旧房间？
This used to be your room?

207
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,350
你小时候一定很健美
You must have been in really good shape as a kid.

208
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,190
我真是个白痴
I'm such an idiot!

209
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,340
我居然以为她会改变
I can't believe I thought she could change.

210
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,400
谁管你妈妈怎么想？
Who cares what your mom thinks?

211
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,770
太莫妮卡了又怎样
So you "pulled a Monica."

212
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,510
这句话还真流行
I'm glad that's catching on.

213
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:48,680
谁说这一定要是坏话？ 去改变它的意义
Why does that have to be a bad thing? Just change what it means.

214
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,310
去证明你妈是错的
Prove your mother wrong.

215
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:55,290
你把工作顺利完成 我们就管它叫太莫妮卡了
You finish the job,and we'll call that "pulling a Monica."

216
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,390
什么？
What?

217
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:02,720
小孩每一科都拿A，父母会说 “你太莫妮卡了”
If a kid gets straight A's,his parents say,"You pulled a Monica."

218
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:08,160
消防员救出一个宝宝 大家会说“他太莫妮卡了”
A fireman saves a baby,and they go,"He pulled a Monica."

219
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:14,210
有人打全垒打，播报员会说 “这是一支好球”
Someone hits a homer,and they say,"That one's out of here."

220
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,070
当然有些事是不会变的
Because some things don't change.

221
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,010
好，我要下楼去
All right. I'll go down there.

222
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,910
我不上意大利面 我要上我做的菜
I won't serve the lasagna. I'll serve what I make.

223
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,290
我的咪咪真有力
My breasts are really strong.

224
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:47,500
钱德，拜托，我得把你铐回去 我的饭碗快不保了
I have to get you locked back up. I'm so going to lose my job!

225
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:50,340
她很在意办公室的隐私权
She's very private about her office!

226
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,670
我总算知道原因了
Now I know why!

227
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,040
你不管怎样都有麻烦
You're in trouble either way.

228
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,710
她看见我被铐在柜子上
If she sees me locked to this...

229
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:01,650
就会知道你进来过 你还不如让我走
...she'll know you were here. You might as well let me go.

230
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,990
我帮你洗浴室1个月 还是洗不干净
-I'll clean your bathroom for a month. -Still won't be clean.

231
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:11,490
我只要我的自由
All I want is my freedom.

232

你为什么不听 苏菲，救救我
Why won't you hear me! Sophie,help me!

235
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,240
苏菲，坐下
Sophie,sit!

236
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,370
自由
Freedom…

237
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,640
请你冷静好吗
Would you just calm down?!

238
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,480
我再说最后一次
I'm going to say this for the last time.

239
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,360
能不能请你…
Would you please just

240
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,160
我对呕吐的了解还真少
There's a lot I didn't know about vomit.

241
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,430
等一下
In a minute.

242
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,840
你觉得如何？
So what do you say?

That works out to just 50 bucks a book.

245

我完全知道了

00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,670
苏菲知道 莫妮卡、菲比知道
Sophie,Monica and Phoebe know.

274
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,210
她们怎么会知道？ 我打给她们
-How do they know? -I called them.

275
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,580
当她们问我看到什么
When they ask me what I saw...

276
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,210
我可以很大方
...I can be very generous...

277
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,750
也可以很小气
...or very stingy.

278
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,160
说下去
Go on.

279
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,790
我可以让你成为传奇
I can make you a legend.

280

我可以让你成为现代的米尔顿・伯利（演员，传说他伟岸无比）
I can make you this generation's Milton Berle.

281
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,670
而米尔顿・伯利的… 根本比不上你
-And Milton Berle has -Not compared to you.

282
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,970
怎样？ 客人碰都没碰意大利面
They're not even touching the lasagna.

283
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,140
真的？ 他们好喜欢你的砂锅
They love your casserole!

284
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,040
漂亮
Yes！

285
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:16,640
不久前这些都还是材料呢
It's hard to believe a while ago this was just ingredients.

286
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,480
大家都很喜欢你做的菜
Everyone seems to like your dish.

287
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,420
那你呢？
And you?

288
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,950
我觉得…
I thought it was...

289
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,330
很好吃
...quite tasty.

290
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,660
要是大家都喜欢，你也喜欢
So if everyone liked it,and you liked it...

291
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:36,330
那就代表很成功，而你…
...that would make this a success. Which would make you....

292
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,800
就是恶婆娘？
A bitch?

293
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,170
我想说“你就错了” 但你的说法也行
I meant "wrong," but we can use your word.

294
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,980
对，我错了
Yes,well,I was wrong.

295
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,880
我必须要说
And I have to say...

296

你今天让我很感动
...you really impressed me today.

297
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,890
你还可以说她太莫妮卡了
You might even say that she "pulled a Monica."

298
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,820
她不知道我们改过了
She doesn't know we switched it.

299
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:07,290
下次你再帮我办宴会的时候
And the next time you cater for me...

300
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,370
冰箱里除了冰不会存别的东西
...there will be nothing but ice in the freezer.

301
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,600
这是很大的鼓励
That really means a lot.

302
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:15,340
妈，别咬指甲
Mom,don't bite your nails!

303
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,140

我爱你
I love you.

306
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,990

308
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,870
持续了2小时
Two hours,that lasted.

309
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,300
所以你跟乔安娜分手了吗？
So did you break up with Joanna?

310
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:47,670
应该是吧
I think so.

311
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:52,010
幸好她像维苏威火山一样爆发之前 你就闪了
It's good you got out,before she blew up like Vesuvius.

312
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,850
火山？
The volcano?

313
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:59,080
对，讲到火山 那些火成岩还真暴力
Speaking of volcanoes,man,are they a violent igneous rock formation!

314
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,790
什么？ 熔岩乱喷，热灰乱飞

315
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,320
不过有些是休眠火山
Of course,some are dormant.

316
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,890
你怎么突然聊起火山来了？
Why are you talking about volcanoes all of a sudden?

321
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:25,030
有人看那部韩战纪录片吗？ 有
Did anyone see that documentary on the Korean War?

322
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,380
韩国那么美
Korea's a beautiful country.

323
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,140
命运却好悲惨
With such a sad history.

324
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,280
有好多姓金的
