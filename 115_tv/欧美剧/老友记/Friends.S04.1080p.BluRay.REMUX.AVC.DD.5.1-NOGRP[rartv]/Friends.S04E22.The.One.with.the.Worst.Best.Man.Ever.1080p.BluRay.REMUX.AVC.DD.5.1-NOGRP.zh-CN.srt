1
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:09,717
我已经上了十次厕所
That was the 1 0th time I've peed here.

2
00:00:09,821 --> 00:00:11,812
你也跟我们说了十次
It's aIso the 1 0th time you've toId us.

3
00:00:12,925 --> 00:00:15,086
抱歉，你们一定听得很烦
Sorry, it must be hard to hear.

4
00:00:15,193 --> 00:00:20,221
三个宝宝在你的膀胱上 蹦蹦跳跳比较好玩
It's easier having babies pIaying ''Bring in Da Funk'' on your bIadder!

5
00:00:22,568 --> 00:00:25,537
我真是受够怀孕了
I am so sick of being pregnant. God!

6
00:00:25,637 --> 00:00:29,573
我睡不着，除非睡床上 但是又会痛，等于睡不着
I can't sIeep, except on my back, which hurt. So I can't sIeep.

7
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:35,747
我唯一的乐趣来自咖啡 但它是低咖啡因的因为我怀孕
My onIy happiness is from a cup of coffee...

8
00:00:33,478 --> 00:00:36,140
...which is decaf because I'm pregnant!

9
00:00:38,417 --> 00:00:40,942
菲比，你要吃饼干吗？
You want a cookie?

10
00:00:42,621 --> 00:00:44,521
谢谢你
Thank you so much!

11
00:00:46,358 --> 00:00:49,919
你的情绪起伏还好吗？
So, honey, how are those mood swings coming?

12
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,264
我还没有这个困扰
I haven't had any yet.

13
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:57,328

15
00:01:42,981 --> 00:01:44,107
Hey, guys.

16
00:01:44,282 --> 00:01:47,376
AII right, here's the ring.

17
00:01:45,884 --> 00:01:47,647
这就是戒指

18
00:01:47,786 --> 00:01:50,414
我愿意，我愿意，千百个愿意
Yes, yes! A thousand times, yes!

19
00:01:52,157 --> 00:01:54,887
单身派对有想法了吗？
Any ideas for the bacheIor party?

20
00:01:56,328 --> 00:02:01,027
托管戒指办派对前 应该先选个伴郎吧？
Before rings and bacheIor parties, you have to decide who your best man wiII be.

21
00:02:01,133 --> 00:02:03,192
真尴尬，尴尬尴尬
Oh, it's awkward.

22
00:02:05,337 --> 00:02:07,567
我已经找钱德了
I aIready asked ChandIer.

23
00:02:07,906 --> 00:02:10,431
什么？你上次结婚他就当过了
He got to do it at your first wedding.

24
00:02:10,542 --> 00:02:13,909
我以为你会了解 我们认识比较久
I figured you'd understand. I've known him Ionger.

25
00:02:14,012 --> 00:02:18,005
拜托啦，我没有兄弟 我永远都没机会了
I don't have any brothers. I'II never be a best man.

26
00:02:18,116 --> 00:02:20,880
你可以当我的伴郎
You can be the best man when I get married.

27
00:02:21,253 --> 00:02:23,585
我没机会了啦
I'II never get to be a best man!

28
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,254
等一下 制片：塔德史帝文斯
Wait, wait.

29
00:02:26,358 --> 00:02:30,852
我让你当两次 你一次也不让我当？
So you'II be my best man twice, and I won't be yours at aII?

30
00:02:31,763 --> 00:02:35,460
你当然可以当我的伴郎
Of course, you can be my best man.

31
00:02:39,371 --> 00:02:41,339
那我呢？你说我可以当
-What about me? You said I couId. -I'm not getting married!

32
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,032
我又没有要结婚

33
00:02:43,442 --> 00:02:46,434
那是科幻小说要挑战的题材
It's a question for science-fiction writers.

34
00:02:46,712 --> 00:02:49,977
你居然不找我 你怎么可以不找我？
I can't beIieve it's not me.

35
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,048
-How couId it not be me? -I'm not even--

36
00:02:50,082 --> 00:02:51,572
我又没要…我又没要… 剧本：麦可寇帝斯等
You know what? That's it.

37
00:02:51,683 --> 00:02:53,776
好，够了

38
00:02:53,885 --> 00:02:57,184
乔伊，从现在起你当我的伴郎
From now on, Joey wiII be my best man.

39
00:02:57,289 --> 00:03:00,315
帅！不过你真的很烂 导演：彼得邦纳兹
Shame about you, though.

40
00:03:05,097 --> 00:03:07,497
别闹 怎么了？
-Stop it. -What?

41
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,966
有个宝宝在踢 那不是好事吗？
One of the babies is kicking.

42
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:14,061
不是踢我，是踢另一个宝宝
That's a good thing.

43
00:03:10,936 --> 00:03:14,372
It's not kicking me. It's kicking another baby.

44
00:03:15,674 --> 00:03:17,505
别逼我进去
Don't make me come in there!

45
00:03:20,946 --> 00:03:23,141
有碗公可以借我吗？
Do you have a big bowI I can borrow?

46
00:03:23,248 --> 00:03:24,681
子下面有一个
There's one under the cabinet.

47
00:03:26,151 --> 00:03:29,279
干嘛？ 我们明天要开派对，回见
-Why do you need it? -We're having a party tomorrow night.

48
00:03:30,355 --> 00:03:32,220
你们有打算要找我们吗？
-Are you pIanning on inviting us? -No. Later!

49
00:03:32,324 --> 00:03:34,087
没有，回见

50
00:03:34,826 --> 00:03:37,317
崔比亚尼，给我滚回来
Get your ass back here, Tribbiani!

51
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,723
荷尔蒙
Hormones.

52
00:03:43,835 --> 00:03:47,271
菲比的意思是 你们开派对怎么不找我们？
How come you're having a party and we're not invited?

53
00:03:47,372 --> 00:03:50,432
那是罗斯的单身派对 所以呢？
-It's Ross' bacheIor party. -So?

54
00:03:50,776 --> 00:03:52,334
你们是单身汉吗？
Are you bacheIors?

55
00:03:53,145 --> 00:03:55,545
不是 你们是脱衣舞娘吗？
Are you strippers?

56
00:03:57,048 --> 00:03:59,516
不是 那就抱歉了
Then you're not invited.

57
00:04:00,285 --> 00:04:04,016
那你们也别想参加我们的派对
Then you're not invited to our party either.

58
00:04:04,122 --> 00:04:05,521
什么派对？
What party?

59
00:04:09,594 --> 00:04:11,084
菲比的送礼会
Phoebe's baby shower.

60
00:04:11,196 --> 00:04:15,326
送礼会？ 听起来就很不想参加，回见
Baby shower? That so doesn't sound Iike something I want to do.

61
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:21,068
你们居然要帮我办派对
I can't beIieve I'm going to have a party.

62
00:04:21,706 --> 00:04:25,335
太棒了，派对耶
That's so great. A party!

63
00:04:32,651 --> 00:04:34,346
我也不懂
I don't know why.

64
00:04:35,654 --> 00:04:38,418
在酒方面我的计划是
This is what I got going for the party Iiquor-wise.

65
00:04:39,024 --> 00:04:41,015
买一大堆酒 很好
-Get a Iot of Iiquor. -Great.

66
00:04:41,927 --> 00:04:45,988
至于邀请名单有你、我、钱德
In terms of the invite Iist, I got you, me and ChandIer.

67
00:04:46,097 --> 00:04:49,464
我会请阿甘 因为我们讨论得很大声
I'II invite Gunther because we're taIking pretty Ioud.

68
00:04:49,568 --> 00:04:50,762
我会去
I'II be there.

69
00:04:51,636 --> 00:04:57,597
派对是为你办的 但我想限制博物馆怪脚的人数
I know it's your party...

70
00:04:54,072 --> 00:04:57,439
...but I'd Iike to Iimit the number of museum geeks.

71
00:04:57,709 --> 00:05:03,409
那就别找人类学家 找搞恐龙的就好
Let's not invite any anthropoIogists. Just the dinosaur dudes.

72
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,414
好，还得买一手汽水酒
We'II need a six-pack of Zima.

73
00:05:10,388 --> 00:05:11,650
你们在干嘛？
Hey, what are you doing?

74
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:16,488
跟我的伴郎筹划我的单身派对
Just pIanning my bacheIor party with my best man.

75
00:05:16,661 --> 00:05:19,221
祝你们办得比上次好
Good Iuck trying to top the Iast one.

76
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:24,826
不难，因为这次 不会办在必胜客的地下室
It won't be that difficuIt since this one won't be...

77
00:05:23,101 --> 00:05:25,194
...in the basement of a Pizza Hut.

78
00:05:26,371 --> 00:05:29,829
我是罗斯，必胜客配不上我
I'm Ross, I'm Ross. I'm too good for the Hut.

79
00:05:31,476 --> 00:05:34,877
我得去接儿子，看样子没问题
I gotta go pick up Ben. Everything sounds great.

80
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,848
总之不要太疯，大家聚聚打牌
Keep it on the meIIow side. A few guys hanging out.

81
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:42,044
不要找脱衣舞娘，好吗？ 没问题
-No strippers or anything. -You got it.

82
00:05:42,153 --> 00:05:43,177
待会见
See you Iater.

83
00:05:45,557 --> 00:05:48,253
好好办不能疯的派对吧
Have fun pIanning your meIIow party.

84
00:05:49,227 --> 00:05:53,129
会有脱衣舞娘，他没说不要
There wiII be strippers. He didn't say anything about no strippers.

85
00:05:55,634 --> 00:05:57,932
他刚就说不要
He just said, ''No strippers.''

86
00:05:58,036 --> 00:05:59,435
我当做没听到
I chose not to hear that.

87
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:03,671
你看我买了什么
Look what I got, Iook what I got!

88
00:06:08,914 --> 00:06:11,109
居然有这种童装
They make these for IittIe peopIe!

89
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,477
给乡下小孩穿的
LittIe ViIIage PeopIe.

90
00:06:15,987 --> 00:06:20,515
你看这件，我最喜欢这件
Look at this one. This is my favorite.

91
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:26,495
太可爱了 菲比一定会很喜欢打扮他们
That is so sweet.

92
00:06:23,428 --> 00:06:25,419
Phoebe wiII Iove dressing them.

93
00:06:27,866 --> 00:06:32,826
但到时替他们打扮的不是她
Except she won't be the one who gets to dress them.

94
00:06:33,872 --> 00:06:36,773
因为她不能把宝宝留着
She won't get to keep the babies.

95
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:41,335
天哪 这真是最令人沮丧的送礼会
My God, we are throwing the most depressing baby shower!

96
00:06:41,947 --> 00:06:46,907
除非送她产后可以用的礼物
UnIess we give her aII gifts she can use after her pregnancy.

97
00:06:47,018 --> 00:06:50,749
像普通咖啡，龙舌兰 一整盒烟
Like reguIar coffee. TequiIa!

98
00:06:49,287 --> 00:06:51,949
-A carton of cigarettes! -She doesn't smoke.

99
00:06:50,855 --> 00:06:54,518
她又不抽烟 心意最重要
-It's the thought that counts. -It's a great idea.

100
00:06:54,626 --> 00:06:58,926
好主意 还有她一直想要的皮裤
And those Ieather pants she's aIways wanted!

101
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,725
她一定会很高兴
She'II Iove that!

102
00:07:00,832 --> 00:07:02,663
这是什么玩意？
What the heII is this?

103
00:07:03,735 --> 00:07:10,038
送我2个月后才能用的礼物 我的心情会好吗？
You thought it'd make me feeI better?

104
00:07:06,338 --> 00:07:09,830
To give me something I can't use for two months?

105
00:07:10,141 --> 00:07:12,006
烂透了
This sucks!

106
00:07:13,578 --> 00:07:15,512
这是谁送的？
-Who gave me this? -WeII, I--

107
00:07:15,613 --> 00:07:20,050
我…我…她们说你喜欢
They toId me you Iike them.

108
00:07:20,218 --> 00:07:25,986
好吧，我错了 这是我收过最棒的礼物
AII right, then I'm wrong. It's a great gift. The best present I ever got!

109
00:07:26,558 --> 00:07:31,325
下一个礼物呢？ 我们都没带
What's my next present?

110
00:07:28,193 --> 00:07:30,354
We don't have anything.

111
00:07:31,663 --> 00:07:34,097
好吧，送礼会结束
AII right, fine, then this is over.

112
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:38,569
真是的…放什么汽球

113
00:07:36,668 --> 00:07:38,397
BaIIoons!

114
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:43,569
对了，那个脱衣舞娘…
-Listen, about the stripper.... -Yeah?

115
00:07:44,242 --> 00:07:45,834
叫得好
Good caII!

116
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:50,414
知道下次要找谁办了吧
So I'II be hosting your next bacheIor party?

117
00:07:50,515 --> 00:07:53,450
我希望这是最后一次
Joey, I'm kind of hoping this wiII be my Iast one.

118
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,715

120
00:08:04,295 --> 00:08:06,195

121
00:08:07,665 --> 00:08:09,462
中央咖啡馆？

谢谢你没娶瑞秋
Thanks for not marrying RacheI.

123
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:16,507
阿甘，记得拿衣服

00:08:25,884 --> 00:08:28,011
（伴郎乔伊崔比亚尼）

128
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,951

乔伊，谢了 别忘了拿衣服
-Thanks, Joey. -Don't forget your shirt.

137
00:09:03,922 --> 00:09:07,983
博物馆怪胎，派对结束了
Hey, museum geeks! Party's over.

138
00:09:08,093 --> 00:09:10,721
跟小姐说再见，快点
Wave bye-bye to the nice Iady. There you go.

139
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:13,229
回爸妈的地下室去
Back to your parents' basement. AII right.

140
00:09:17,068 --> 00:09:20,231
出来吧，来
Boys, come on out. Here you go.

141
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:24,301
好可爱喔，是你养的？
Look at the birdies! Are those yours?

142
00:09:24,943 --> 00:09:28,071
我不知道可以养鸡鸭当宠物
They Iet you keep chickens and ducks as pets?

143
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:31,546
我把鸭子训练得很好，你看
And I got the duck totaIIy trained too.

144
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,577
盯着墙壁
Stare at the waII.

145
00:09:34,786 --> 00:09:36,720
几乎不动
HardIy move.

146
00:09:37,856 --> 00:09:39,847
白白的
Be white.

147
00:09:41,192 --> 00:09:44,127
你真行
You are good at that.

148
00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:48,125
今晚很愉快，派对办得很棒
I had fun tonight.

149
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:49,891
-You throw one heII of a party. -Thanks. It was great meeting you.

150
00:09:48,233 --> 00:09:50,098
谢了，很高兴认识你

151
00:09:50,201 --> 00:09:55,639
要是我有朋友要结婚 或是过生日、过星期日…
If any of my friends ever get married or have a birthday or a Tuesday....

152
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,571
那就太好了
Yeah, that'd be great.

153
00:09:58,443 --> 00:10:01,412
那就再见了
So, I guess, good night.

154
00:10:01,513 --> 00:10:05,449
除非你想留下来
UnIess you want to hang around.

155
00:10:05,683 --> 00:10:09,175
是吗？ 对，你可以跟我的鸭子玩

156
00:10:07,485 --> 00:10:09,919
I'II Iet you pIay with my duck.

157
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:26,803
跳脱衣舞的
Stripper!

158
00:10:38,316 --> 00:10:41,649
舞娘把戒指偷走了
The stripper stoIe the ring!

159
00:10:41,753 --> 00:10:44,051
钱德，起床 舞娘把戒指偷走了
ChandIer, get up! The stripper stoIe the ring!

160
00:10:45,223 --> 00:10:47,487
什么？ 戒指被偷了
-What? -The ring is gone!

161
00:10:48,793 --> 00:10:52,194
先让我清醒一下
Just give me a minute to wake up for this.

162
00:10:54,933 --> 00:10:58,130
你把戒指弄丢了 你是最烂的伴郎
You Iost the ring. You're the worst best man!

163
00:10:58,803 --> 00:11:03,263
不好笑，怎么办？ 我去睡觉，一切正常
This isn't funny. I go to sIeep, everything's cooI.

164
00:11:03,374 --> 00:11:06,502
等我醒来，舞娘不见了 戒指也不见了
I wake up, the stripper's gone, and the ring is gone!

165
00:11:06,611 --> 00:11:08,909
你跟她上床？ 废话
-You sIept with her? -Of course!

166
00:11:11,616 --> 00:11:14,107
你们两个 菲比
-Hi, guys. -Hi, Phoebe.

167
00:11:15,887 --> 00:11:22,292
我想说声抱歉 我昨天在送礼会上似乎凶了点
I wanted to apoIogize if I seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower.

168
00:11:22,994 --> 00:11:24,552
荷尔蒙作崇
Just the hormones.

169
00:11:24,662 --> 00:11:27,187
别这样，我们… 荷尔蒙嘛
-No, we-- -Hormones.

170
00:11:27,298 --> 00:11:31,291
谢谢你们，你们真有心
I wanted to say thank you. It was so sweet.

171
00:11:36,241 --> 00:11:39,039
你似乎好多了，太好了
You seem to be doing much better.

172
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,275
你现在怎样？ 很好
-How are things going? -Good.

173
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:47,045
最近的注意力都在我 你们呢？
Everything's been about me IateIy. So what's happening with you?

174
00:11:47,151 --> 00:11:51,781
我们正在说 我不去参加罗斯的婚礼
We were just taIking about me not going to Ross' wedding.

175
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:56,258
有那段过往，我可能很难面对
It just might be too hard, given the history and aII that.

176
00:11:56,361 --> 00:12:00,695
这让我想起当年流落街头时
This reminds me of the time when I Iived on the street.

177
00:12:00,798 --> 00:12:03,631
有人说我陪他上床就请我吃饭
This guy offered to buy me food if I sIept with him.

178
00:12:06,838 --> 00:12:08,931
这两件事哪里像？
How is this Iike that?

179
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,874
我想想…的确不像
WeII, Iet's see. It's not reaIIy Iike that.

180
00:12:12,977 --> 00:12:16,003
因为那才算是问题
Because that was an actuaI probIem.

181
00:12:16,114 --> 00:12:22,644
你这只是高中女生无病呻吟 没人在乎
And yours is just a bunch of high-schooI crap...

182
00:12:19,584 --> 00:12:22,246
...that nobody reaIIy gives!

183
00:12:27,725 --> 00:12:29,955
抱歉，我只是…
I'm sorry. I just thought--

184
00:12:30,061 --> 00:12:32,291
泪眼攻势来了
Here come the water works.

185
00:12:34,465 --> 00:12:38,299
我已经没辄了 我打给仲介站，他们不管
I caIIed the company that sent her, and they don't care.

186
00:12:38,403 --> 00:12:42,601
我打119又被吼 这还不算紧急事件吗？
I caIIed 91 1 and they yeIIed at me. This is an emergency!

187
00:12:43,341 --> 00:12:46,310
我真的很想帮忙 但我打算去看“铁达尼号”
I reaIIy wanna heIp you out, but I got pIans to go see Titanic...

188
00:12:46,411 --> 00:12:49,608
所以我要打119问场次
...so I've got to caII 91 1 to find out what time it starts.

189
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:53,014
我来了
Hey, guys.

190
00:12:54,686 --> 00:12:59,919
谢谢你，派对办得很棒 博物馆那伙人玩得很爽
Thanks again for Iast night. What a great party.

191
00:12:57,889 --> 00:12:59,652
The guys from work had a bIast.

192
00:13:00,024 --> 00:13:03,187
其中有一个没参加过单身派对
One of them had never been to a bacheIor party before.

193
00:13:03,294 --> 00:13:07,355
另一个没参加过派对
Another one had never been to a party before.

194
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,069
那个结婚戒指
So that wedding ring.

195
00:13:13,871 --> 00:13:15,736
可真漂亮 漂亮吧
-Man, that is nice. -Yeah, right?

196
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:21,369
我也想买一个，要去哪里买？
I might pick one of those babies up for myseIf.

197
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,674
Where might one get one of those?

198
00:13:22,413 --> 00:13:24,040
那个戒指？
When my grandmother first came to this country...

199
00:13:24,148 --> 00:13:26,548
我奶奶刚来到这个国家时

200
00:13:26,651 --> 00:13:30,417
全身上下只有那只戒指 和一小包衣服
...that ring and the cIothes on her back were aII she had with her.

201
00:13:33,057 --> 00:13:37,016
所以那只戒指可说是无可取代
So you might say that the ring is irrepIaceabIe.

202
00:13:38,296 --> 00:13:41,356
当然，它是我家的传家宝
AbsoIuteIy. It's been in my famiIy for generations.

203
00:13:41,466 --> 00:13:45,596
每个戴上它的新娘 都能幸福到老
Every bride who's worn it has Iived a Iong and happy Iife.

204
00:13:45,703 --> 00:13:49,036
所以简直算是一只魔戒
So you might say it's a magic ring.

205
00:13:53,878 --> 00:13:55,072
被脱衣舞娘偷了
Yeah, the stripper stoIe it.

206
00:13:57,682 --> 00:13:59,013
什么？
What?

207
00:13:59,851 --> 00:14:01,819
你刚才说…
-What did you just-- -I think I heard what he said.

208
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:04,888
我想我听到了，他应该是说…
I beIieve it was, ''The stripper stoIe the ring.''

209
00:14:04,989 --> 00:14:07,719
“被脱衣舞娘偷了”

210
00:14:09,994 --> 00:14:16,524
偷了我的戒指？我的结婚… 脱衣舞娘偷了我的结婚戒指？
My ring? My wedding ring?

211
00:14:12,397 --> 00:14:16,424
The stripper stoIe my wedding ring?

212
00:14:16,634 --> 00:14:18,795
怎么会这样？
How couId this happen?

213
00:14:18,903 --> 00:14:22,964
原因就在于你说了 “乔伊，你来当我的伴郎吧”
It aII started when you said, ''Joey, you be my best man!''

214
00:14:25,476 --> 00:14:28,445
好，我来报警
AII right. I'm going to caII the cops.

215
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:31,671
我搞砸了你也不用报官捉我
I screwed up. But you don't have to turn me in.

216
00:14:32,383 --> 00:14:34,510
不是捉你，是捉那个舞娘
-Not on you, on the stripper. -I aIready did that.

217
00:14:34,619 --> 00:14:40,216
我试过了 他们说等侦破所有谋杀案再说

218
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,113
They said they'd Iook into it after they soIve aII the murders.

219
00:14:40,558 --> 00:14:42,958
那就找仲介站
-We'II caII the company that sent her. -I did that too.

220
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,621
我也试过了 他们不肯透露她的真名或电话
They wouIdn't give me her reaI name.

221
00:14:46,731 --> 00:14:48,631
他们说我再打去就要报警
They said if I bother them again, they'd caII the poIice.

222
00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:51,224
我说“你去啊” “就说我掉了一只戒指”
I said, ''You taIk to the poIice, you teII them I'm missing a ring.''

223
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:56,565
难道一点办法也没有？
So, what are you teIIing me?

224
00:14:54,739 --> 00:14:56,331
There's nothing we can do?

225
00:14:56,674 --> 00:14:57,732
怎么会这样？
-How couId this happen? -Look, Ross, I am so sorry.

226
00:14:57,842 --> 00:15:01,835
罗斯，我真的很抱歉

227
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:11,514
我们可以再叫她一次 用假名把她找去我的办公室
What if we just caIIed her...

228
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:10,911
...used a fake name and had her come to my office?

229
00:15:11,622 --> 00:15:14,420
好像不赖，但我们得找戒指
That sounds Iike fun, but we got a ring to find!

230
00:15:21,566 --> 00:15:23,158
菲比，你的茶
Here's your tea, Phoebe.

231
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,335
感觉真好
It's so good.

232
00:15:32,977 --> 00:15:34,239
谢谢
Thanks.

233
00:15:34,345 --> 00:15:36,370
那就好 你喜欢就好
-Good. -So gIad you Iike it.

234
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:40,379
怎样？茶是她泡的
What? She made the tea.

235
00:15:42,386 --> 00:15:44,946
不是，我刚才阵痛了
I think I just had a contraction.

236
00:15:45,056 --> 00:15:46,683
什么？ 天哪
-What? -My God!

237
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:50,852
几分钟前就有一次 这次绝对错不了
I feIt one a few minutes ago.

238
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:50,590
That definiteIy was one.

239
00:15:50,962 --> 00:15:55,092
你不能在这里生 男生搬走之后我还没消毒
You can't have the baby here.

240
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:55,258
I haven't steriIized the apartment since the guys moved out!

241
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:01,138
没事，别怕，我来烧水撕床单
It's okay. I'II boiI some water and rip up some sheets.

242
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,073
别紧张，可能是假性阵痛
It's probabIy faIse Iabor.

243
00:16:05,176 --> 00:16:08,668
接近预产期会这样，去拿书来
That can happen near the end. Just get the book.

244
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:11,339
瑞秋，拿书来 书，好
-Get the book! -The book!

245
00:16:13,384 --> 00:16:15,375
圣经？ 我哪知啊
-The BibIe? -I don't know!

246
00:16:21,692 --> 00:16:23,489
好，很好
AII right. This is great.

247
00:16:23,661 --> 00:16:25,322
钱德，你站到桌子后面
You get behind the desk.

248
00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:30,264
但愿她一进来不会认得你 因为…她怎么会认得你
When she comes in, she won't recognize you because--

249
00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:30,530
WeII, why wouId she?

250
00:16:31,135 --> 00:16:33,262
然后你对罗斯和我打暗号
And then you buzz Ross and I.

251
00:16:33,371 --> 00:16:37,000
你是冈萨勒斯先生 我是王先生
You be Mr. GonzaIes, and I'II be Mr. Wong.

252
00:16:39,176 --> 00:16:40,370
民族大F炉
Diverse.

253
00:16:42,246 --> 00:16:44,874
有人叫警卫吗？
Anybody caII for security?

254
00:16:46,117 --> 00:16:48,608
冷静
You be cooI.

255
00:16:53,524 --> 00:16:57,051
好，哪位是阿甘中央咖啡馆？
Which one is Gunther CentraI Perk?

256
00:16:58,996 --> 00:16:59,860
乔伊
Joey.

257
00:16:59,964 --> 00:17:03,593
我的戒指呢？ 我过世的奶奶的结婚戒指呢？
Where's my ring? My dead grandmother's wedding ring.

258
00:17:05,703 --> 00:17:07,000
你还真冷静
Way to be cooI, man.

259
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,431
你在说什么？
What?

260
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:14,910
床头柜的丝绒盒里有只戒指 你一走它就不见了
There was a ring in a box. After you Ieft, it was gone.

261
00:17:15,112 --> 00:17:17,546
你们觉得我偷了戒指？
You think I stoIe some ring?

262
00:17:19,684 --> 00:17:23,017
一定是你偷的 少废话，从实招来
We know you took it! Just save yourseIf the time and confess.

263
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,384
你们是少年侦探团吗？
Who are you, the Hardy Boys?

264
00:17:28,693 --> 00:17:33,687
我不必偷什么戒指 我1星期赚1600
I don't need to steaI a stupid ring. I make $ 1 ,600 a week.

265
00:17:33,798 --> 00:17:35,265
你们有人赚那么多吗？
Any of you guys make that?

266
00:17:36,734 --> 00:17:38,065
嫁给我
Marry me.

267
00:17:41,939 --> 00:17:44,407
我不懂，戒指整晚都在我房里
I don't get it. It was in my room aII night. She didn't take it.

268
00:17:44,508 --> 00:17:48,968
她没拿，我没拿，你没拿 那是谁拿的？
I didn't take it. You didn't take it. Then who did?

269
00:17:51,015 --> 00:17:52,812
安静，我们在想事情
We're trying to think.

270
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:10,029
你怎么会知道是假痛？
I don't get how you know it's faIse Iabor.

271
00:18:10,134 --> 00:18:11,999
你有看到宝宝吗？
Do you see any babies?

272
00:18:13,838 --> 00:18:16,636
你感觉如何？ 还好吧
-How do you feeI? -Okay, I guess.

273
00:18:17,808 --> 00:18:23,178
我不知道 大概是知道快要结束了
I don't know.

274
00:18:19,644 --> 00:18:22,841
I know it's going to be over soon so....

275
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,445
那不是很好吗？你说你受够了
But isn't that a good thing?

276
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:29,511
-You said you were sick of this. -I know.

277
00:18:28,686 --> 00:18:35,751
我知道，只是通常怀孕完之后 就是当妈妈
UsuaIIy, when you're done with the pregnant thing...

278
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,020
...you get to do the mom thing.

279
00:18:36,694 --> 00:18:41,893
我却会穿着皮裤喝龙舌兰
But I'II be sitting around in my Ieather pants, drinking tequiIa.

280
00:18:44,035 --> 00:18:45,593
有些妈妈也会那样
Some moms do that.

281
00:18:47,338 --> 00:18:48,805
那样更悲惨
That's even sadder.

282
00:18:50,174 --> 00:18:53,769
我知道这么做的后果
Look, I know what I got myseIf into.

283
00:18:54,578 --> 00:18:56,808
但他们现在在我肚子里
It's just that now that they're in me...

284
00:18:57,615 --> 00:19:02,211
我仿佛了解他们

285
00:18:59,216 --> 00:19:02,617
...it's Iike I know them and....

286
00:19:03,521 --> 00:19:07,787
把他们送走时我会很难受
It just won't be easy when these babies have to go away.

287
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:12,819
我知道，但你并不会一无所有
I know, sweetie.

288
00:19:10,361 --> 00:19:12,795
But it's not Iike you won't have anything.

289
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:16,889
你会有侄子侄女 那样甚至更棒
You'II have nieces and nephews. That's even better.

290
00:19:17,001 --> 00:19:19,492
少来 不，是真的
-Yeah, okay. -No, reaIIy.

291
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:24,573
你不必担心他们的大学学费
You won't be the one worrying about saving for coIIege.

292
00:19:24,675 --> 00:19:27,610
或在他们不乖时骂他们
Or yeIIing at them when they're bad.

293
00:19:27,712 --> 00:19:31,307
或在他们吵个不停时 喂他们吃立得宁
Or putting them on RitaIin when they just won't caIm down.

294
00:19:33,284 --> 00:19:38,244
他们逃家会来找你 会找你讨论性的问题
You'II be the one they run away to. The one they taIk to about sex.

295
00:19:38,355 --> 00:19:41,256
你可以当酷阿姨菲比
You just get to be cooI Aunt Phoebe.

296
00:19:43,027 --> 00:19:44,688
酷阿姨菲比
CooI Aunt Phoebe.

297
00:19:45,796 --> 00:19:47,423
我是蛮酷的
I am pretty cooI.

298
00:19:48,866 --> 00:19:54,065
还有，他们一定会爱死你
And you know what eIse? Are they going to Iove you!

299
00:19:54,205 --> 00:19:55,797
他们会爱死我
They are going to Iove me.

300
00:19:57,641 --> 00:20:00,405
谢谢你们…再次感谢
Thanks, you guys. Again.

301
00:20:00,511 --> 00:20:02,138
谢什么
Oh, sweetie.

302
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,082
怎么了？ 开玩笑的
Thanks.

303
00:20:05,616 --> 00:20:06,605
What?

304
00:20:06,784 --> 00:20:07,808
Just kidding.

305
00:20:09,353 --> 00:20:10,843
怎么了？ 天哪
Oh, my God!

306
00:20:10,955 --> 00:20:13,116
又骗到了，你们真好骗
Got you again. You're so easy!

307
00:20:16,994 --> 00:20:21,192
要是它有事… 乔伊，兽医说手术很简单
If anything happens to him--

308
00:20:18,662 --> 00:20:21,631
The vet said it's a simpIe procedure.

309
00:20:21,298 --> 00:20:25,098
所以呢？搞不好会出错 要是它没撑过来呢？
Things can go wrong. What if he doesn't make it?

310
00:20:25,202 --> 00:20:28,296
它会的 要是没有呢？
-He wiII, Joe. -But what if he doesn't?

311
00:20:29,173 --> 00:20:30,902
它这么乖巧
He's such a good duck.

312
00:21:10,114 --> 00:21:12,207
我好担心它
I'm so worried about him!

313
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,449
有人掉了戒指吗？
Somebody Iose a ring?

314
00:21:15,553 --> 00:21:19,080
天哪！谢谢你，谢谢
Oh, my God! Thank you! Thank you so much!

315
00:21:22,493 --> 00:21:23,687
鸭子怎么样？
How's the duck?

316
00:21:23,794 --> 00:21:26,820
它很好，正在休息 你们可以去见它
Just fine. You'II see him in a bit.

317
00:21:26,931 --> 00:21:28,228
太好了
Great.

318
00:21:28,332 --> 00:21:30,732
罗斯，谢谢你这么好脾气
-Thanks for being so cooI. -No, that's aII right.

319
00:21:30,835 --> 00:21:33,065
没关系 当然有关系
You made me your best man and I totaIIy Iet you down.

320
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:36,628
你找我当伴郎，我却让你失望

321
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,901
又不是你的错 当然是
-It's not your fauIt. -Yeah, it is.

322
00:21:39,009 --> 00:21:41,409
你就不会弄丢戒指
You wouIdn't have Iost it.

323
00:21:41,512 --> 00:21:45,448
你知道吗？罗斯，你是对的 他才应该当你的伴郎
Ross, you were right. He shouId be your best man.

324
00:21:45,549 --> 00:21:47,779
不，应该你当 别吵了
-No, you shouId. -Don't argue.

325
00:21:47,885 --> 00:21:51,116
伴郎是我选的
I get to choose my best man.

326
00:21:52,323 --> 00:21:54,018
你们两个我都要
I want both you guys.

327
00:21:55,659 --> 00:21:57,092
真的？
ReaIIy?

328
00:21:58,429 --> 00:22:01,193
你们都应该陪我站在神父面前
Both you guys shouId be up there with me.

329
00:22:01,498 --> 00:22:03,523
你们是我的…
You two are my--

330
00:22:04,668 --> 00:22:08,126
有一个好朋友就…
I'm Iucky to have just one good--

331
00:22:09,673 --> 00:22:11,231
谢了
Thanks, man.

332
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,471
我去那边看看
I got to go check something, okay?

333
00:22:20,851 --> 00:22:22,785
真孩子气 有够爱哭的
-What a baby! -TotaI wuss.

334
00:22:31,996 --> 00:22:34,487
为什么奶奶的戒指是给你？
-How come you're getting Nana's ring? -Mom gave it to me.

335
00:22:34,598 --> 00:22:35,826
是妈给我的
She said something about it being a wedding ring and that you may not need...

336
00:22:35,933 --> 00:22:39,164
她说有个婚戒比较大 你又可能用不上

337
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,828
...one.

338
00:22:41,972 --> 00:22:43,963
我实在不必说这些
I reaIIy didn't need to teII you aII that.

339
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:48,041
我觉得不公平 我一直很喜欢那个戒指
I don't reaIIy think it's fair. I mean, I've aIways Ioved that ring.

340
00:22:48,145 --> 00:22:52,775
对不起，我原本会让给你 但艾蜜莉对它爱不释手
Oh, Mon, I'm sorry.

341
00:22:49,647 --> 00:22:53,549
I'd Iet you have it, but EmiIy's gotten reaIIy attached to it.

342
00:22:52,883 --> 00:22:54,646
好吧 谢谢
Thanks.

343
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,682
拿去
-Here you go. -Thanks.

344
00:22:57,988 --> 00:23:02,152
你知道那个戒指 在鸭子肚子里摆了2天吗？
EmiIy, did you know that that ring spent two days in a duck's coIon?

345
00:23:04,461 --> 00:23:05,450
