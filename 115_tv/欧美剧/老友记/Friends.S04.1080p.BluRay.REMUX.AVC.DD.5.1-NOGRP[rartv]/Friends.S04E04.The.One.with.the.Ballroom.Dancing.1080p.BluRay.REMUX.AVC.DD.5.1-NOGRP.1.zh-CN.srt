 I know I know some nice gay here. But they're all so quiet.

 笑得很尴尬 手心直冒汗
 Awkward smiles and sweaty palms.

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,920
 我也不指望能在这里见到布拉德.皮特
 I'm not expecting brad pitt to walk into st. Theresa's.

 Fyi...要我说的话 是那些人的错而不是你
 fyi... if you ask me,it's more the guys' fault than yours.

16
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,450
 House也有责任
 and house isn't blameless either.

17
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,320
 要不是他挑拨我们的关系
 if he hadn't pitted us all against each other- -

18
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,180
 是我的错 我的过失

 not often do you get a patient who sees dead people.

25
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,910
 什么文件?
 what file?

26
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,310
 你说什么? 半小时前我就给Bosley了
 what the hell? I gave it to bosley a half hour ago.

27
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,160
 没半小时 就10分钟
 it was not a half hour. it was ten minutes.

28
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,880
 你先复印了急症室记录

29
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,760
 少多嘴 加奶油
 less lip,more whip.

30
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,100
 我之所以接这个病例
 I only agreed to take this case

31
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,240
 是因为你说会给我加奶油的咖啡
 because you said that this mocha frapalicious would have whip on it.

32
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,060

 你怎么知道的? 你在跟踪他的消息?
 how do you know about it? you keeping tabs on him?

37
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,020

00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,360
 当Bosley就这么进来的时候

 24- year- old funeral cosmetician suffered a grand mal seizure at work.

41
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,800
 他怎么变得像Bosley了?
 why does he get to be bosley?

42
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,720
 你也想扮Bosley? Bosley是个无性使者
 you want to be bosley? bosley's like the asexual messenger boy.

43
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,710

45
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,040
 无癫痫史 无脑外伤或吸毒史

48
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,920
 可CT扫描是正常的
 not with a normal ct scan.

49
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,000
 你是说急诊室医生觉得正常
 you mean it appeared normal to the doc in the er.

50
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,460
 你开始恢复了 Thirteen

51
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,280
 - 那是Amber - 不错啊 女暴君

 bullets aren't contagious. but infections,parasites- -

57
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,990

 you said one of us wasn't a doctor,and you called him a fraud.

58
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:48,090
 他不是医生 继续 Boz
 he's not a doctor.  continue,boz.

59
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,610
 - 可能是性传染病 - 为什么不炒了他?
 -  could be an std - why isn't he fired?

60
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,010

 天使们 要小心
 and,angels,be careful.

70
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,420
 他虔诚并不代表他就不会踹你一脚
 just because he's religious doesn't mean he won't kick your ass.

 the guy's a wuss. he's gonna be the next one on the train.

75
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,090
 定义一下"踹你一脚"

76

 - 任何身体上的对质 - 还是口头上的?

 定义"口头上"

00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,580
 任何高于... 70分贝
 anything over...  70 decibels.

79
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,790
 你不能就这么突然对他好了
 and you can't start suddenly being nice to him.

80
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,540
 你知道这里鼓励什么
 you realize what you're encouraging here.

81
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,200
 是啊 有人踹了你一脚

 and then we'll have some nice,warm milk when you're done.

86
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,280
 我宁可要更多安定剂
  I'd rather have more valium.

87
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,550
 再等一会儿 看看效果如何

 Thirteen就是把锁

91
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,210
 他没有行医执照 却还在继续干
 he doesn't have a medical license and he's still around.

92
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,130
 她害死了一个坐轮椅的男人 还有他的狗
 she killed a guy in a wheelchair. and his dog.

93
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,050
 他不关心我们的资格和创意
 he doesn't care about our qualifications or ideas.

94
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,000
 就是想找乐子
 he just wants to have fun.

95
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,910
 而她就是最后的乐子 因为她令人费解
 and she's the ultimate fun 'cause he can't figure her out.

96
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:42,230
 - 真是疯狂的游戏 - 那就辞职吧

97
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,540
 就算输了也高兴
 happy to lose the competition.

98
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:48,190
 要是写在简历上 辞职总比被炒了好看
 if it's gonna be on your resume,it's gotta be better to quit than get fired.

99
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,680
 要么辞职 要么少废话
 either quit or shut up.

100
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:57,970
 其实 炒了House会合适得多
 actually,with house,getting fired might look better.

101
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,860
 House医生是个危险的自大狂
 dr. house is a dangerous egomaniac.

102
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,380
 这也是我离开的原因 我们在行事原则上有分歧
 that's why I left. we had different ideas on how to practice.

103
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,640
 很高兴听你这么讲 说说Mercy医院的事
 glad to hear it. tell me about mercy.

104
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:12,980
 老实说 Schaffer医生并没给我机会
 to be honest,I don't think dr. schaffer really gave me a chance.

105
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,840

106
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,280
 救了一个病人
 saved a patient's life.

107
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,210
 这好像不是解雇的理由
 that's usually not grounds for dismissal.

108
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,080
 - 你和她谈过了? - 是的
 - have you spoken to her? - yes.

109
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,200
 那还为什么问我发生了什么?
 then why are you asking me what happened?

110
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,820
 你有一份很棒的简历
 you have an excellent resume.

111
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,840
 我觉得应该由你自己来说 应该说的事
 I felt I owed it to you to hear what you had to say.

112
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,960
 她跟你说什么了?
 what'd she tell you?

113
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,950
 你违背了她的指示和医院手续
 that you defied her instructions and hospital procedures.

114
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,510
 事情就是这样 我也没什么说的了
 that's what happened. nothing more I can add to that.

115
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,830
 你可以说是你错了
 you could tell me that you were wrong.

116
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:48,340
 似乎你应该早点离开House
 sounds like you didn't leave house quite soon enough.

117
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,190
 尸体是干净的 她的食物也是
 cadavers were clean.  so is her food.

118
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,370
 都是未加工的有机物
 it's all organic unprocessed crap.

119
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,910
 那就是尸体防腐剂的问题了
 it's gotta be the embalming fluid.

120
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,090
 酒精会对人的精神产生作用
 ethanol can have psychoactive effects- -

121
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:02,110
 Bosley! 告诉那个在说话的他是个白痴
 bosley!  tell whoever's talking that he's an idiot.

122
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,600
 Bosley 要么说他是个白痴 或者告诉我是我错了
 bosley. either tell him he's an idiot, or tell me why I'm wrong.

123
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,800
 你是个白痴
 you're an idiot.

124
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,700
 你以为急症室没有排除防腐剂时
 you actually think that I'd take a patient who had a seizure in a funeral home

125
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,270
 我会接下这个病人?
 if the er hadn't already ruled out embalming fluid?

126
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,180
 我想应该相信...
 I thought we weren't supposed to trust- -

127
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,500
 白痴 源自古法语
 idiot,from the old french, "

128
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,230
 "白痴"  意思就是那些 娘娘腔的 脑袋少根筋的摩门教徒
 idiote," meaning effeminate,mentally deficient moor.

129
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,530
 从停尸房05年以来的文件里 我发现了点东西
 I found something in the mortuary's files from '05.

130
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:35,180
 一名被认为死于肺炎的48岁男性
 a 48 - year old male's cause of death was listed as pneumonia,

131
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,900
 但验尸报告显示的症状与此不符
 ibut the symptoms in the autopsy report didn't fit.

 因为情况似乎很"有意思"
 so because the answer might be "cool,"

139

 你想给一个24岁的女性做脑切片检验?

 把他挖出来
 we dig him up.

144
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,300
 没有法院许可我不会去挖尸体
 I am not digging up a body without a court order.

145
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,100
 别想成是挖尸体
 don't think of it as digging up a body.

146
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,700
 这是为了不让下一个人也被埋葬
 think of it as keeping another one from being buried.

147
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,690
 我干不了
 I can't do it.

148
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:23,130
 什么时候我们俩再谈谈
 we gonna have another one of those ecumenical discussions

149
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,810
 到时候让你信服你的信仰有多荒谬?

150
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,810
 我6点钟要回家

 上帝工作了6天 然后就说他得休息一会儿
 the lord works for six days, then tells the union he needs a rest.

153
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,910

 you know,if I was all - powerful,it'd take at least two days.

 你在那儿安了照相机?

158
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,840
 没有 我猜的
 no. I was guessing.

159
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,370
 昨天和前天都沾着
 he had oatmeal on his pants yesterday and the day before.

160
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:55,540
 叫你妻子照顾孩子

161
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,640
 我是单身父亲
 I'm a single dad.

162
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,430
 单身妈妈呢?
 where's the single mom?

163
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,670
 我不知道
 I have no idea.

164
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,720
 有意思 你是说判断上的错误
 interesting. you claim a lapse of judgment,

165
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,850
 还是说判断上的错误 就是信仰上的错误?
 or you gonna admit that a lapse in judgment is a lapse in faith?

166
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,640
 他走了
 he's gone.

167
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:20,070
 合情合理 家最重要
 fair enough.  family comes first.

168
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:32,150
 Cuddy医生 我是Amber Volakis House医生的新同事
 dr. cuddy,I'm amber volakis,one of dr. house's new fellows.

169
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:36,530
 性骚扰投诉去找人力资源部 压力过大可申请职业补偿
 sexual harassment claims go through h. r. stress-related leaves through worker's comp,

170
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,850
 任何犯罪指控
 and any accusations of criminal activities

171
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,670
 直接去找普林斯顿平原市警察局
 go directly to the princeton plainsboro police department.

172
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:46,030
 实际上 我是在想诊所今晚是否需要帮忙
 actually,I was wondering if you needed any extra help in the clinic tonight.

173
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,760
 你这么贴着House不会有进步
 you're not going to score any points with house by kissing my ass.

174
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,730
 了解 不过我听说House医生 不喜欢诊所义务
 understood. but I hear dr. house hates clinic duty.

175
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,310
 要是他听了我自愿加班这样的话
 if he were to hear through the grapevine that I was willing to work overtime,

176
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,030
 帮他减轻点负担...
 take some of it off his hands-

177
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:00,200
 我给你的建议是 House叫你今晚干嘛你就干嘛
 my advice to you is to do whatever house wants you to do tonight.

178
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,710
 至于明晚 你再过来 我会给你额外的任务
 and then tomorrow night,you can come back and I will give you extra clinic duty.

179
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,420
 这儿的人都有信任问题吗?
 does everybody around here have trust issues?

180
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,280
 我不知道House要你干什么 也不想知道
 I don't know what house wants you to do,and I don't want to know.

181
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,630
 但要是你是在干不了 现在就可以辞职
 but if you really have a problem with it,quit now.

182
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,480
 不然只会变得更糟
 it's only gonna get worse.

183
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,330
 - 好了 该谁了? - 不是我
 - all right,who's up? - not me.

184
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:28,840
 你还没挖过
 you haven't done any digging yet.

185
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,980
 我是外科医生 要是手出了什么问题 我就完了
 I'm a surgeon. if anything happens to these hands,I'm screwed.

186
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,590
 让Bosley来吧 只要他还能折衣服...
 let bosley do it. as long as he can keep folding laundry- -

187
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,650
 有人来了
 someone's coming.

188
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,570
 我们还不跑?
 shouldn't we be running?

189
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,340
 是警察的话就跑 要是保安就把他拿下
 if it's a cop,run. security guard,I say we take him down.

190
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,220
 抱歉我来晚了
 sorry I'm late.

191
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,180
 - 你到底去哪儿了? - 我迷了路
 - where the hell have you been? - oh,I got lost.

192
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,410
 我们都到了3个小时了
 been here over three hours.

193
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,430
 真的迷了路
 really lost.

194
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,870
 我带了咖啡和甜甜圈
 I brought coffee and donuts.

195
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,060
 Thirteen 你在这儿长大的?
 so thirteen,you grow up around here?

196
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,670
 我们是在挖坟 你还想闲聊?
 we're digging up a grave,and you want to chit - chat?

197
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:18,340
 我只是找些话说 人们都这样
 I'm just making conversation. it's what people do.

198
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,120
 你为什么隐瞒一切?
 why are you hiding everything?

199
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,490
 我问这个问题就是因为 你的确是在隐瞒一切
 and I'm asking you that question because you're hiding everything.

200
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,640
 我很担心 你肯定有什么问题
 there's something seriously wrong with you. I'm worried.

201
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,290
 不 你不会
 no,you're not.

202
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:34,720
 好吧 但我很恼火 因为我发现你不是个怪人
 fine,but I am freaked,because I don't think you're a freak.

203
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,830
 我想你是故意这样 因为你知道House会感兴趣
 I think you're doing this on purpose because you know house will be intrigued.

204
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,080
 是的 我在这儿长大
 yeah,I grew up around here.

205
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,870
 亲爱的 我回到家了
 honey,I'm home.

206
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:55,750
 - 拿铁撬 - 不 下面地方不够大
 get the crowbar. no,there's not enough room to maneuver a crowbar down here.

207
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,220
 哦 上帝保佑
 oh,god help us.

208
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,960
 - 什么? - 看到什么了?
 - what the hell? - what is it?

209
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,760
 是脚 他们埋反了 
 ankles. they buried the guy the wrong way around.

210
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,780
 休息室里都是泥
 the doctor's lounge is covered in mud.

211
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:23,230
 餐厅里没果冻了 Thirteen和女暴君有点争执
 thirteen and cutthroat bitch had a disagreement, and the cafeteria was out of jell- o.

212
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,310
 还有铁镐
 there were pickaxes.

213
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:28,730
 不是你叫他们去挖死人了 就是你想造铁路
 either you had them dig up a body,or you're building a railroad.

214
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,700
 一小块脑子 都没用了 
 a little tiny piece of his brain. seemed a waste.

215
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,890
 他又不需要
 he wasn't using it anymore.

216
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:35,240
 这就是你的狡辩?  "我们刚把他肢解了"?
 that's your defense? "we just dismembered him"?

217
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:38,730
 他们在查是不是克雅氏病
 they're looking for creutzfeldt - jakob.

218
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,890
 有结果了吗?
 you get the results yet?

219
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,340
 你很喜欢我嘴巴里的气味吗?
 does my breath smell baited to you?

220
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:48,430
 是啊 要是知道什么了就告诉我
 yes. let me know when you hear anything.

221
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:51,250
 顺便把那地方弄干净
 and get that mess in the shower area cleaned up.

222
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,810
 我认识那人
 I know just the guy.

223
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:55,340
 他们多少人同意挖坟?
 how many of them agreed to dig up a grave?

224
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,700
 六个
 six.

225
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,770
 但是别担心 没去的那个不是在原则上不同意
 but don't worry,the one who didn't didn't stand on principle.

226
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:01,030
 他只是要去给孩子换尿布
 he just had a diaper to change.

227
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,190
 我真觉得这个团队不会作出错误的选择
 I really think there are no bad choices in this group.

228
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,230
 你们进来时没把鞋擦干净吗?
 you guys don't wipe your feet when you come in the house?

229
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,960
 休息室 走吧
 doctor's lounge. let's go.

230
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,180
 为什么是我?
 why me?

231
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,820
 我不能叫那个黑炭或者女人去干活 否则会太敏感
 I can't ask the black guy or one of the chicks to do it, that would be insensitive.

232
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:33,750
 你又不能叫Bosley去 否则你就像在雇个不算医生的
 and you can't ask bosley because that'd look like you only hired the non- doctor

233
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,490
 去干不是医生干的活
 to do non - doctor stuff.

234
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:39,320
 你在拖时间 但你还是得去 然后还不给你拖把
 you keep stalling,you're still gonna clean up,but I won't let you have the mop.

235
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,730
 带回来样本的 雅克氏病检验呈阴性
 sample came back negative for creutzfeldt - jakob.

236
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,120
 这样的讨论不会花多少时间
 well,that discussion didn't last long.

237
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,320
 我就不知道还会是什么原因 原来的推测...
 I just don't know what else there is.  we had an idea.

238
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,190
 看来是错的
 it was wrong.

239
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,840
 好啊 那我们都回家
 well,we can go home.

240
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,930
 我是说 既然不知道她出了什么问题
 I mean,we have no idea what's wrong with her.

241
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:03,740
 就是说有可能根本不是什么大毛病
 which means it could be completely benign.

242
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,950
 或者 由于我们的轻率 她会因此丧命
 or,on the off chance that it's killing her,

243
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,430
 我们可以从头再来
 we could take it again from the top.

244
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,260
 你们已经做了能做的一切
 you've already done everything.

245
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,380
 我们可能漏掉了什么
 we may have missed something.

246
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,010
 我就想回家 我确信已经好了
 I just want to go home. I'm sure I'm fine now.

247
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:20,990
 Reena 医生最清楚
 reena,the doctors know best.

248
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,660
 你有些严重的症状 发作时...
 you had some serious symptoms. the seizure- -

249
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,340
 要是我又发作就来医院 行吗?
 if I have another one,I'll come right back,okay?

250
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,930
 要是你在开车时发作...
 if you have it while you're driving...

251
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,470
 你来开车 我没关系
 you can drive me. make sure I take it easy.

252
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,390
 谁开车?
 who can?

253
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,260
 我妈妈
 my mother.

254
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,680
 你妈妈在这儿?
 your mother's here?

255
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,350
 你说什么呢? 她不就在那儿嘛
 what are you talking about? she's right there.

256
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:58,850
 你们检验了所有体液 也看过她的大脑
 you sampled every bodily fluid,  peeked in her brain,

257
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:01,440
 侵犯了尸体的隐私
 violated a cadaver's privacy,

258
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,610
 去挖了尸体
 dug up a body,

259
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:08,840
 但还是忽视了一个事实 她还在看到不存在的事物
 but missed the fact she was still seeing things that weren't there.4

260
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,360
 神经上的病症变糟了
 neurological symptoms are getting worse.

261
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,220
 要是你们这些天使还是低能儿 知道线索该有多好
 it'd be nice if one of you angels/morons had a clue why.

262
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:20,350
 我们都问过了 她从没提过 看到或听到过什么异常事物
 we did a full history. she never mentioned seeing or hearing anything unusual.

263
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:23,610
 哦 要是她什么都不说 你怎么知道的?
 oh,well,as long as she never said anything. how were you to know?

264
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:26,110
 是脊髓的毛病? 她跟你说没问题?
 same thing with the spinal fluid? she tell you that was fine?

265
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,820
 实验室的结果都清楚了
 the labs were all clear.

266
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:32,300
 那么不是我们走到头了 就是你们漏掉了什么
 then either we're about to meet the alpha and omega,or you missed something.

267
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,030
 我们忽视了一个新症状
 we missed the new symptom.

268
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,370
 不是什么新症状 都知道她有幻觉
 it's not a new symptom. we always knew she had hallucinations.

269
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,340
 看到她妈妈是幻觉
 seeing her dead mother's a hallucination.

270
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,170
 不知道她已经死了就是错觉
 not knowing she's dead is a delusion.

271
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:45,660
 说的有理 你都快成精了
 you keep this up,you're gonna have to start wearing sexier clothes.

272
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,140
 一氧化碳可能导致错觉
 uh,carbon monoxide could also cause delusions.

273
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,650
 很多鬼屋...
 a lot of haunted houses- -

274
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,940
 没有头疼 也没有心跳加速
 there's no headache. no tachycardia.

275
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,980
 我想是你在医学院没学好吧
 I guess they didn't cover that at your medical school.

276
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,730
 有没有可能是遗传关系?
 what about a hereditary connection?

277
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:59,070
 她现在24岁 她妈妈25岁时死的
 she's 24. her mother died when she was 25.

278
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:02,310
 在20年前的乌克兰 有这样的记录就不错了
 in ukraine,20 years ago. good luck trying to get those records.

279
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,830
 我们要创造新纪录
 we start new records.

280
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:06,570
 检验所有符合症状的遗传病例
 test for every hereditary disease that fits the symptoms.

281
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:09,970
 至少有40种不同的线粒体异常 另外还有2百多种...
 there are at least 40 different mitochondrial disorders,another couple hundred- -

282
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:13,430
 从淀粉样变性开始 一直查到...
 start with amyloidosis,keep going until you reach...

283
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,280
 "Z淀粉样变性"
 zamyloidosis.

284
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,510
 你们在检查什么?
 now what are you testing for?

285
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,450
 或者我该问你们没在查什么?
 or should I ask what you're not testing for?

286
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,550
 要是能告诉我们你妈妈因何而死 就方便多了
 well,we could narrow it down if you could remember what your mother died from.

287
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,180
 我妈妈没死
 my mother is not dead.

288
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,490
 她就坐在那儿
 she's sitting right there.

289
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,660
 你觉得我们会骗你?
 do you think we're lying to you?

290
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,210
 让她去吧
 leave it alone.

291
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,690
 要她相信她妈妈已经死了不会让她好起来 只会使她更痛苦
 convincing her that her mother's dead isn't gonna make her better,just miserable.

292
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,520
 你也失去妈妈了吗?
 you lose your mother?

293
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,740
 你觉得我们在骗你吗?
 do you think we're trying to trick you?

294
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,260
 我们何必这样?
 why would we do that?

295
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,200
 因为你们很卑鄙
 because you're mean.

296
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,740
 你们的工作很不称职
 and you're not good at your job.

297
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:00,210
 Reena 别这样 你太无礼了
 reena,stop. you're being cruel.

298
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,850
 他们在浪费时间
 they're wasting time- -

299
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:05,250
 尽做些那个坐轮椅的人说的 他们做过的事
 doing exactly what the guy in the wheelchair said they'd do.

300
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,480
 有个坐轮椅的人在这儿?
 a guy in a wheelchair was here?

301
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,020
 你们知道我在说谁
 you know who I'm talking about.

302
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,650
 我被带到这里时他就在转悠了
 he's been hanging around ever since they brought me in

303
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,930
 抱怨这里的人是多么的不称职
 complaining about how incompetent everyone is.

304
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,190
 他还说你们杀了他的狗
 said you killed his dog.

305
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,360
 这样没道理
 it doesn't make any sense.

306
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,440
 我没兴趣
 I'm not interested.

307
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,480
 要是你没兴趣就不会来了
 if you weren't interested,you wouldn't be here.

308
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,200
 我以为只是来吃吃饭
 I thought it was social.

309
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,440
 不 不是 你总是觉得一切都安排好了
 no,you didn't. you always think there's an agenda.

310
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,720
 这就是我离开的原因
 that's why I left.

311
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,620
 你就好在这里
 that's why you're good.

312
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,690
 - 你需要工作 - 我会找一份的
 - you need a job. - I'll find a job.

313
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:44,420
 - 我需要一个能理解House的人 - 让他们慢慢学
 - and I need someone that understands house. - they'll learn.

314
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,410
 要有一个能控制House的人
 I need someone that can control house.

315
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:50,860
 继续找吧 得花点时间
 keep looking. might take awhile.

316
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:56,720
 我会把所有人的工资都降低15% 拿出来给你
 I'll cut the salary of everyone else on the team 15%,give it to you.

317
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,260
 比你另外找工作得到的要好多了
 that's more than you'll get anywhere else.

318
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:01,930
 House怎么说的?
 what does house say about this?

319
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:05,600
 你是这支队伍里他一直尊重的人
 you're the one person on the team that he always respected.

320
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:09,640
 这家餐馆离你住的有20分钟的路 离我住的有半小时的路
 this restaurant is 20 minutes out of your way. half an hour out of mine.

321
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,640
 你选这里就是要确信House不会突然出现
 you picked it to make sure house didn't drop in on us.

322
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,960
 这是我的决定 不是他
 it's my decision,not his.

323
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,210
 那你就去这么跟他说吧 然后自己跑回办公室 我来和他讨价还价
 and you tell him that,then run back to your office while I get to deal with him.

324
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,220
 我离开是有原因的 这个原因一直都没变
 I left for a reason,and that reason hasn't changed.

325
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:35,240
 那么...有什么消息?
 so... what's the news?

326
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,980
 到目前为止都是阴性的
 everything's negative so far.

327
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,210
 好的 为什么不全部弄完了再来跟我说?
 yes. why wait to finish before reporting to me?

328
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,640
 我有事情要做 你知道
 I have things to do,you know.

329
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,000
 她又看到了别的人
 she's seeing someone else.

330
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,400
 这又不是什么新闻 都听过了
 that's not news. that's olds.

331
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,870
 见鬼 上帝为什么要把人设计成这样?
 damn it. why did god design the human body this way?

332
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:51,120
 是个坐轮椅的人
 a guy in a wheelchair.

333
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,960
 这是医院 你是不是有点神经过敏了
 in a hospital.  it's enough to give you the heebie- jeebies.

334
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,760
 那人有一只狗 她看到的是Stark
 he had a dog.  she's seeing stark.

335
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,820
 我们上一个病人
 our last patient.

336
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:02,670
 如果是Stark 不会去纠缠病人
 well,if it's stark,he wouldn't be haunting a patient,

337
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,400
 而会去纠缠那个害死他的医生
 he'd be haunting the doctor who killed him.

338
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,450
 也许她只是无意中听到过别人说...
 she probably just overheard someone talking about it- -

339
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:12,260
 也许? 你认为这种情况有可能吗?
 probably? you think there's a possibility that the alternative is true?

340
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,390
 不
 no.

341
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,160
 那就别傻了
 then go away.

342
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,250
 我们是在浪费时间 检验了32支凝胶 还有100支
 we're wasting time. we ran 32 gels.

343
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,730
 还没搞清楚她妈妈怎么死的...
 without knowing how her mother died- -

344
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,530
 那就去剩下的100支做完
 you're gonna have to run 100 more.

345
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:25,100
 就是说你 一定是那种关心人类生命 以至于不惜花一整天干活的人
 and by you,of course, I'm only referring to the people who care enough about human life to put in a full day.

346
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:27,140
 要一起用车吗?
 you want to carpool?

347
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,900
 要我怎么回应你的问题?
 h- how do you expect me to respond to this stuff?

348
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,930
 就像这样
 exactly like you just did.

349
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,730
 我自己有个理论 也许你能证明
 I have a theory.  maybe you can help me out.

350
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:38,280
 黑人摩门徒象征了性受虐
 black mormon means masochist.

351
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,240
 象征了某些特别嗜好
 means kinky.

352
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,800
 我就觉得有人因为私生子受到了伤害 我说的对吗?
 I'm thinking that someone got hurt making the bastard. am I right?

353
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,070
 别扯上我儿子
 you leave my son out of this.

354
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:47,980
 我没说你儿子伪善 而是在说你
 I wasn't referring to your kid's hypocrisy. I was referring to yours.

355
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,730
 我们为什么不问问她是怎么死的?
 why don't we just ask her how she died,hm?

356
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,570
 她不会告诉我们
 because she won't tell us.

357
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,070
 她觉得她妈妈还活着
 she thinks her mother's still alive.

358
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,960
 我不是指问病人 而是问她妈妈
 I don't mean ask the patient, I mean ask her mother.

359
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,850
 有意思
 cool.

360
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,820
 走吧
 come on.

361
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,330
 到底什么意思?
 what the hell does that mean?

362
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,290
 你们俩在说什么语言?
 you guys talking your own language now?

363
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:15,590
 很抱歉 下次我弄些视频讲解
 I'm sorry. I'll try to include some visual aids next time.

364
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,310
 又想怎样?
 now what?

365
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:27,160
 我是House医生
 I'm dr. house.

366
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,420
 你妈妈在这里?
 is your mom around?

367
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,150
 我为什么要告诉你?
 why should I tell you?

368
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,040
 你们刚说我不是骗人就是疯了
 you're just going to tell me I'm lying or crazy.

369
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,690
 不会那样了
 not gonna do that.

370
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,810
 我真的需要知道她要说的话
 I really need to know what she has to say.

371
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,090
 你想要什么?
 what do you want?

372
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,430
 你小时候 她...
 when you were young,was she- -

373
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,420
 不 没说你 是他
 no,not you. him.

374
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,670
 那个坐轮椅的男人?
 the man in the wheelchair?

375
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,980
 不 他很老
 no.  he's old.

376
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,080
 实际上 他长得像你
 actually,looks like you.

377
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:06,410
 没错 这位是House爷爷
 yeah,that's grandpa house.

378
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,630
 跟他说我会用座机给他回电话
 tell him to call back on a land line.

379
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,730
 里面信号不好
 terrible reception in here.

380
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,500
 你妈妈有多痛苦?
 how much pain was your mom in?

381
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,600
 我是Walter
 it's walter.

382
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,980
 他说他的名字叫Walter
 he says his name is walter.

383
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,320
 有什么需要吗?
 can I help you?

384
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,560
 有位病人在和我的Walt爷爷聊天
 my patient's talking to my grandpa walt.

385
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,840
 你有个Walt爷爷?
 you have a grandpa walt?

386
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,200
 没有
 no.

387
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,960
 所以我怀疑其实她没看见什么灵魂
 which is what made me suspect that maybe she's not actually seeing into the afterlife.

388
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,210
 你怎么突然对灵魂着迷了?
 what is this sudden obsession with the afterlife?

389
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,730
 我唯一着迷的是那些 生活在此时此地
 only obsession is with the idiots in the right- here-

390
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,960
 而又相信有灵魂的白痴
 and - now life who think there's an afterlife.

391
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,710
 那你要我...
 and you want me to- -

392
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:04,450
 没什么 就是来躺会儿
 nothing. just need a place to hang low for awhile.

393
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,420
 我假装被鬼吓到了
 I'm pretending to be spooked.

394
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:07,820
 因为...
 because...

395
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:12,610
 因为如果我这个快要脑死亡的病人 觉得我相信她
 because if my soon- to- be brain dead patient thinks that I believe her,

396
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:15,380
 也许她会让我和她妈妈的鬼魂聊聊
 maybe she'll let me chat with her mother's ghost.

397
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,560
 而你觉得是不存在的
 the one you don't believe exists.

398
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:21,540
 不错 那鬼魂只是她的幻觉 由一种遗传疾病引发
 exactly.  the ghost is a hallucination, which is the result of a delusion,

399
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:26,490
 也就是她四岁的时候  她母亲致死的那种病
 of a hereditary disease that her mother died from when the patient was four.

400
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:29,670
 而你觉得可以通过了解她的幻觉
 and you think you can tap into her subconscious memory

401
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:31,820
 从而了解她的潜意识
 by tapping into her hallucination.

402
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,420
 对头
 hmm.

403
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,600
 也许她不知道她母亲的死因
 she might not know what caused her mother's death,

404
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,010
 但她总知道母亲死前的行为如何吧?
 but she will know how she acted before she died.

405
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:40,440
 你很洋洋自得嘛
 you're quite impressed with yourself right now,aren't you?

406
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,020
 谁不会呢?
 who wouldn't be?

407
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,100
 差不多是时候了
 well,that should be long enough.

408
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,300
 马上回来
 back in a flash.

409
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,480
 慢慢来
 take your time.

410
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,210
 我祖父还在吗?
 is my grandfather still here?

411
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:01,380
 不在了
 no.

412
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,160
 他应该马上就回
 he should be right back.

413
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,760
 他出去买点热奶
 he just went to get some warm milk.

414
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,070
 但你妈妈还在 对?
 but your mom's still here,right?

415
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,970
 恩 当然了
 yes,of course.

416
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:19,110
 我知道她现在没事 但当你四五岁的时候 她生了病
 I know she's fine now,but when you were 4 or 5,she got sick.

417
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,190
 没有
 no.

418
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,440
 肯定吗?
 you sure?

419
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,830
 她就没有感到任何病痛?
 she wasn't in any pain?

420
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,690
 我一点也没有
 I wasn't in pain.

421
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,280
 她只是累了
 she was just tired.

422
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,490
 有时她会在床上躺一整天
 and sometimes she would stay in bed all day.

423
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:29,680
 她有摔倒过吗?
 did she ever fall down?

424
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,110
 当然了 每个人都偶尔会摔倒
 of course. everyone falls down once in awhile.

425
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,260
 有时候 不是经常
 sometimes. not that often.

426
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,290
 多久一次?
 how often?

427
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:41,830
 实际上 也许比"偶尔"要多一点点
 maybe it was actually more than once in awhile.

428
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,120
 还记得在浴室那次吗?
 remember that time in the bathroom?

429
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,120
 有几次
 a few times.

430
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,750
 一次她头摔到洗手池上
 once she hit her head on the bathroom sink.

431
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:54,740
 血流得一地都是 还沾到我衣服上了
 there was blood all over the floor.  I got it on my sweater.

432
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,260
 他们带走了她
 they took her away.

433
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,390
 带她到医院 医生治好了她
 to the place where the doctor made her better.

434
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:07,130
 但在那之后 她手脚还利索不?
 but before that,what about her arms and legs?

435
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,990
 她走路的样子会不会怪? 比如有点驼背?
 did she ever walk funny? like sort of bent over?

436
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:14,510
 我以为那是因为从小农活干多了
 I thought that was from growing up on the farm.

437
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:19,790
 她的手呢? 会不会用手干活的时候有困难呢?
 what about her hands?

438
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:22,150
 没事
 no.

439
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:27,270
 不过有时候 我的手会 呃...抖个不停
 but sometimes,my hands would,um,shiver.

440
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,470
 就像很冷一样 但我不觉得冷 一直都搞不太明白
 like I was cold. but I wasn't. I never quite understood.

441
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:34,930
 她的手以前会好像发冷一样的颤抖
 she used to get the shivers like she was cold.

442
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:52,430
 给她服用左旋多巴(治疗帕金森病 ) 和溴麦角环肽(抗震颤麻痹)
 start her on l - dopa and bromocriptine.

443
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,210
 只不过是帕金森而已
 it's just parkinson's.

444
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,250
Cole  cole.

445
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:09,340
 你病人状况如何?
 how's it going with your patient?

446
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,490
 仍然有幻觉
 still seeing stuff.

447
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,660
 我听说House待你很刻薄
 I hear house is treating you like crap.

448
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,380
 他对每个人都如此
 he treats everyone badly.

449
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,260
 恩 但我听说你的情况不大一样
 yeah,but I heard you're special.

450
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,040
 这个我能搞定
 oh,I can handle it.

451
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,310
 你不该忍声吞气
 maybe you shouldn't.

452
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:23,660
 他会得寸进尺的
 he's gonna walk all over you if you let him.

453
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,650
 那表明问题不在我而在他
 that says nothing about me,just him.

454
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:28,460
 House尊重那些不惧怕他的人
 house respects people who aren't afraid of him.

455
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,410
 勇敢面对他
 get in his face.

456
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:32,480
 必要的时候吼几句
 yell if you have to.

457
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,690
 我不需要他的尊重
 I don't need his respect.

458
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,580
 若你想得到这份工 就必须得这样
 you do if you want the job.

459
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,220
 谢谢你的建议
 thanks for the advice.

460
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:48,690
 你别动啊!
 you have to hold still!

461
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,490
 我在努力了!
 I'm trying!

462
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,360
 - 该死! 按住她! - 不!
 - damn! hold her down! - no!

463
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:56,050
 - 别! - 让我来!
 - stop it! - let me do it!

464
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,099
 按住她!
 hold her down!

465
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,480
 不!
 no!

466
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,470
Irene  irene.

467
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,720
Irene?  irene?

468
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:23,560
 你刺了我
 you stabbed me.

469
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,650
 你在发噩梦 不是真的
 you were having a nightmare. wasn't real.

470
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:28,600
 我手臂在流血
 my arm is bleeding.

471
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,230
 不 现在没事了 你的手没有...
 no,it's okay now. your arm's not-

472
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,840
 帕金森症无法解释她身上的创伤
 lesions aren't explained by parkinson's.

473
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,870
 还有什么见解吗?
 any theories?

474
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,920
 被鬼吓得说不出话了?
 a ghost got your tongue?

475
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,700
 我没事
 I'm fine.

476
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:53,130
 脉管炎呢?  核磁共振成像并无检测出脑缺血
 what about vasculitis?  mrI didn't indicate any cerebral ischemia.

477
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:56,010
 但她出现了局灶的衰弱麻痹 和尿潴留的症状
 but she has shown some focal weakness,urinary retention.

478
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,650
 没错 那就是她身上最令人费解的症状了
 yes,those are her big mystery symptoms.

479
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:00,010
 脉管炎无法解释为什么出现幻觉
 not the hallucinations that vasculitis doesn't explain.

480
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:02,320
 除非是视网膜脉管炎
 unless it's retinal vasculitis.

481
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:07,860
 House 这家伙的确聪明  我也肯定他是个适合喝酒谈心的朋友
 house,this guy may be smart,and I'm sure he's great to share a beer with.

482
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:11,797
 但如果他连视觉症状是一种电子反应 不关血管事都不知道的话
 but if he doesn't know that visual symptoms are an electrical issue,not vascular,two separate systems- -

483
00:28:11,797 --> 00:28:12,980
 这可是两个完全独立的系统呢

484
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,950
 银行与电力网也一样啊
 so are the banks and the power grid.

485
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:18,540
 但如果我不付账 就无电可用
 but if I don't pay my bills,my lights go out.

486
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:28,880
 脉管炎限制了血液流向脑神经 干扰了电信号
 vasculitis restricts blood flow to nerves,messes with electrical function.

487
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,160
 急性间歇性卟啉症更为适合解释这种症状
 acute intermittent porphyria's a better fit.

488
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,070
 若错诊为卟啉症  其治疗手段会破坏掉病人的肾脏
 if you're wrong about porphyria,the treatment could box her kidneys.

489
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:36,750
 用糖皮质激素治疗脉管炎
 vasculitis is treated with corticosteriods.

490
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,600
 相对来说 副作用会小些
 relatively harmless.

491
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,900
 - 给她用类固醇 - House 这家伙...
 - start her on the steroids. - house,this gu- -

492
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,840
 并针对这两种可能病症作检查 免得他又唧唧歪歪
 and test for both so he'll stop whining.

493
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,164
 大爱之子啊 (HBO 以摩门教生活为主题的电视剧)
 big love,have I humiliated you in the last half hour?

494
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,209
 我在这半小时里有没侮辱过你?

495
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,350
 没有
 no.

496
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,970
 查收一下你的电邮
 check your email.

497
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,040
 怎么样?
 how's it going?

498
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,730
 好极了
 great.

499
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:05,530
 他要得到好脸色就得忍受这份痛苦
 the only way he could turn any more cheeks is by pulling down his pants.

500
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:07,900
 他可不弱 要撂倒他可得费大力气...
 he's not a wuss. it takes a lot more strength- -

501
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,190
 喂 我们又不是赌他有多壮
 hey,we didn't bet on how strong he was.

502
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:13,860
 所以你想赢这100块钱然后炒了他 就因为他是个信教的人?
 so you're gonna collect $100 and fire him because he has principles?

503
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,000
 你打算怎样? 很显然你不在乎那100块钱
 what's your agenda here? obviously don't care about the $100.

504
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,780
 他正派又聪明...
 he's a decent,smart- -

505
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,900
 你就不管整个团队了
 you don't care about the team.

506
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,430
 Wilson有没有觉得你很烦? 你喜欢问人问题 又不听人回答
 does it annoy wilson when you ask questions and ignore the answers?

507
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,810
 当然了
 very much.

508
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:27,210
 你只关心我聘了谁 炒了谁
 you only care about who I hire and who I fire,

509
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,570
 因为你没去看我发你的电邮
 'cause you miss going through my mail.

510
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:32,700
 你就是一个劲儿的想控制我
 you can't stop controlling me.

511
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,340
 没人要控制你
 no one controls you.

512
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,010
 - 想要回你份工吗? - 不
 - want your job back? - no.

513
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:37,860
 真可惜 我也没说要请你
 too bad. you can't have it.

514
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,310
 她会搞定的
 she'll take care of this.

515
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,630
 你就等着掏你将要欠我的那100块吧
 you can take it out of the $100 you're gonna owe me.

516
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:47,320
 五年前 我在一个会议上遇见了House
 I met house at a conference about five years ago.

517
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,680
 他可是个人物
 he's quite a character.

518
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,550
 恩 的确
 yes,he is.

519
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:52,150
 也许是我们这代人中 最好的医生了
 probably one of the best medical minds of our generation.

520
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:54,760
 同意 从他身上我学到了很多东西
 I agree. I learned an awful lot from him.

521
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,090
 那当然了
 I'll bet you did.

522
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:59,060
 我看到了 在Mercy医院干过一阵子 很好
 I see here,just did a stint at mercy. great.

523
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,510
 上面写着07年至今
 it says here "'07 to present.

524
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,950
 你在哪儿待了多久?
 " how long were you there?

525
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:07,280
 一个月吧 Schaffer医生很棒  但我们不大合得来
 about a month. dr. schaffer was great,but just wasn't the right fit.

526
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,310
 等等 那个淋巴瘤病人是你和 Schaffer医生一起治疗的?
 wait,was that you with dr. schaffer and the lymphoma patient?

527
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,810
 是的 恩 当时情况的确不乐观
 it was,um,it was a tough situation.

528
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,280
 我本来能做的更好
 I probably could've handled it better.

529
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:18,820
 不 Schaffer医生现在该坐立不安了 恭喜你
 no. dr. schaffer's got a stick up her rear. good for you.

530
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,590
 为什么你那么肯定是淋巴瘤?
 what made you so sure it was lymphoma?

531
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:23,450
 在她一份检测报告中 乳酸指数不太正常
 there was an unusual lactic acid level in one of her labs.

532
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:25,280
 几个月前我有个类似的病例
 I had a similar case a few months ago.

533
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,590
 漂亮
 beautiful.

534
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,780
 天哪 真想有你那份男子汉气概
 god,I wish I had your stones.

535
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,240
 是啊 有男子汉气概不就出来找工作了么
 well,my stones are on the market.

536
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,380
 不是这意思 我是说 我希望有你那份男子汉气概
 no,I mean,seriously,i wish I had your stones.

537
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,960
 这样我就敢把你推荐给管理委员会了
 then I could cram you down the board of directors.

538
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,570
 但我没有
 but I don't.

539
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:44,150
 抱歉 祝好运
 I'm sorry,man. good luck.

540
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:49,800
 当人通过视网膜看到东西 它们就会将电信号传送到大脑
 when your retina sees something, they send electrical signals to your brain.

541
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,090
 这些镜片能接受那些信号
 these lenses will pick up those signals.

542
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:53,850
 若信号不正常 
 if tnals are misfiring,it'll confirm

543
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:57,310
 就说明一个无牌行医的老头都比我们聪明
 that an old man without a medical license is smarter than all of us.

544
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,880
 你的幻觉就是由...
 that your hallucinations were caused by- -

545
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,750
 那些不是幻觉 告诉他们 妈妈
 they're not hallucinations. tell her,mom.

546
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:04,030
 宝贝 他们是医生
 honey,they're doctors.

547
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:06,020
 他们知道自己在做什么
 they must know what they're doing.

548
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:09,500
 若他们知道 那个可怜人的狗就不会死了
 if they know what they're doing,how'd they kill that poor man's dog?

549
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,850
 别这样 你肯定被吓到了
 come on,this has got to be freaking you out a little bit.

550
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,070
 谢谢你的关心
 I appreciate your concern.

551
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,770
 没什么好丢脸的
 there's nothing to be ashamed of here.

552
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:25,370
 若被你害死的那人的鬼魂没有让你心烦意乱 那你才有问题呢
 if the ghost of a man you killed doesn't screw with your head,there's something wrong with your head.

553
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,280
 看到了吗? 那个吓着我了
 see,that freaks me out.

554
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,230
 肯定有人忘在这儿了
 someone must've left it in here.

555
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:40,140
 噢 当然了 这说得过去
 oh,absolutely. that makes sense.

556
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,850
 那只狗在这儿检查眼睛 忘记把它的"项链"戴回去了
 the dog was in here getting his eyes checked and forgot to put his jewelry back on.

557
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:44,340
 这没用
 this isn't working.

558
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:47,080
 你们只是加重了我的病情  就像他说你们...
 you're just making me sicker like he said you- -

559
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,680
 怎么了?
 what's wrong?

560
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,650
 我肚子 好疼
 my stomach,it hurts.

561
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:55,720
 眼科出状况了
 code in the eye lab.

562
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,760
 向前倾 Irene 你得吸气
 lean forward,irene. you're gonna aspirate.

563
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,790
 不行 好疼
 I can't. it hurts.

564
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:03,150
 你们怎么不肯救我?
 why won't you help me?

565
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,960
 脾脏都化脓裂开了
 spleen's ripe to bursting.

566
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,160
 你们还以为这是脉管炎?
 you guys thought it was vasculitis?

567
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,410
 你曾经在House的团队 对吗?
 you used to be on house's team,right?

568
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:16,690
 恩
 yeah.

569
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:18,700
 这里血太多了 海绵
 there's a lot of blood in here. sponge.

570
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,770
 - 有什么建议给我没? - 没
 - you got any advice for me? - nope.

571
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:24,750
 你得经常忍受他那些废话吗?
 did you always put up with his crap?

572
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,320
 对
 yup.

573
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:30,220
 - 这样忍声吞气对吗? - 不相干
 - was it a mistake? - it was irrelevant.

574
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,600
 但他开除了你
 he fired you.

575
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,630
 反正最后无论怎样...他都会炒了你
 he'll fire you either way... eventually.

576
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:36,690
 Cameron医生告诉我...
 dr. cameron told me- -

577
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:38,330
 - 不 不 不 - 为什么不让我说?
 - no,no,no. - why not?

578
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:41,440
 因为...House正在看
 'cause... house is watching.

579
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:44,660
 我不是在打比方 往上看
 not a metaphor. look up.

580
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:52,020
 你们要继续打屁  还是处理一下那个出血部位?
 you guys gonna shoot the breeze or you gonna do something about all that bleeding?

581
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:58,620
 看来出血的不是脾脏 而是肝脏
 that's not coming from the spleen. it's the liver.

582
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,730
 肝脏坏死了
 it's necrotic.

583
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:01,810
 内脏的坏死就快要她的命
 she's dying from the inside out.

584
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,539
 肿大的脾和坏死的肝 这是典型的急性间歇性卟啉病
 enlarged spleen and liver failure are classic a. i. p. it's porphyria and it's moving fast.

585
00:33:11,539 --> 00:33:13,080
 这是卟啉症 而且扩散的很快

586
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,630
 卟吩胆色素原呈阴性... 读过报告就知道了
 pbgs were negative- - if you read the report.

587
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:18,550
 只有在病发时作的卟吩胆色素原测试 才能用于定论
 pbg tests are only conclusive if done during an attack,

588
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:21,190
 若你是个真正的医生  就会知道了
 which you would know if you were a real doctor.

589
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,650
 真是太棒了
 that is just great.

590
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:24,180
 什么太棒了我们中哪一个?
 - what is? - which one of us is?

591
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,280
 你们两个 一起
 both of you. together.

592
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,400
 热烈的争论 急切地想去证明对方 的观点错误
 fighting.  passionate to prove the other one wrong.

593
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,610
 完全抛开了病人  但最后能治好就行了
 couldn't care less about the patient,but it all works out the same.

594
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:33,990
 我讨厌Thirteen
 I hate thirteen.

595
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:35,590
 这不能成为结论
 not as productively.

596
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,360
 继续
 continue.

597
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,560
 仍然有可能是脉管疾病
 it could still be vascular.

598
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:42,110
 脉管炎已被排除了 类固醇治疗没起作用
 vasculitis is off the board. steroid treatment didn't help.

599
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,960
 脉管疾病并不只有脉管炎而已
 vascular isn't just vasculitis.

600
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,130
 一定有什么东西  阻断了肝脏和脾脏的血液供给
 something's gotta be cutting off the blood supply to her liver and spleen.

601
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:49,390
 做个内脏血管造影
 do a visceral angiogram.

602
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,550
 开玩笑的 对吧?
 this is a joke,right?

603
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:53,170
 他不可能每次都对
 he can't be right every single time.

604
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:56,020
 你肯定在给他灌输你自己的看法 从而让我们难堪
 you're feeding him your ideas just to embarrass us.

605
00:33:56,020 --> 00:34:00,040
 若我想刁难你  我就会派你去休息室拖地了
 if I wanted to embarrass you,I'd have you mop up the doctor's lounge.

606
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:38,770
 天父啊 我恳求你圣灵降临于
 heavenly father,I pray thee that thou shalt give the holy ghost

607
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:43,100
 所有信徒们
 unto all them that shall believe in their words.

608
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,070
 Irene 你在干嘛?
 irene. what are you doing?

609
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,540
 我要摸
 I need to touch it.

610
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,490
 Irene 把手放下
 irene,put your hand down.

611
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:51,010
 不 给我! 我想要!
 no,give it to me! I want it!

612
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:53,080
 给我!
 give it to me!

613
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,160
 血管造影结果如何?
 what'd the angio say?

614
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,910
 我们还没做完 她就开始摸我
 we couldn't finish. she started groping me.

615
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:09,560
 为了把测试做完 你就不肯牺牲一下 让她上二垒?
 you couldn't let her get to second base just to get the test done?

616
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:11,000
 我认为那是三垒了
 I think that's third base.

617
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,900
 她在抽搐 神志不清 而且唾液分泌过量
 she was convulsing,delirious,and hyper - salivating.

618
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,030
 我们只好给她打镇定剂
 we had to knock her out with lorazepam.

619
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,640
 好吧 这肯定不是脉管疾病
 well,it's definitely not vascular.

620
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,340
 你想我们怎么办?
 what do you want us to do?

621
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,460
 问题是Joseph Smith会怎么办? (摩门教的创办人)
 question is what would joseph smith do?

622
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,590
 现在不是时候来...
 this isn't the time for- -

623
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,670
 驱魔?
 casting out the demons?

624
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:29,620
 病人没有着魔 她快死了 要嘲笑我的话 明天随便你
 the patient's not possessed.  she's dying. you can mock me tomorrow.

625
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:33,030
 你相信经文中有一切的答案
 you believe that the book has all the answers.

626
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,450
 只对做人而言 并不关科学事
 to morality. not science.

627
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:37,620
 但宗教与科学是两个对立面
 but the book is inconsistent with science.

628
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:40,680
 你知不知道多少癫痫病人受人折磨 只因他们以为这是着魔的表现?
 you know how many epileptics were tortured because they were possessed?

629
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,790
 又有多少女巫被人用石头砸死 只因她们采蘑菇?
 how many teenage witches were stoned to death 'cause they took mushrooms?

630
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:46,230
 闭嘴! 我们的病人生命正岌岌可危!
 just shut up already! we got a patient dying!

631
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:51,110
 要么开个驱魔处方出来 要么就当我面承认Smith是个好色的骗子
 either got to prescribe an exorcism or admit to me that smith was a horny fraud.

632
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,190
 我知道她的病因了
 I know what she has.

633
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:08,260
 你怎么不早10秒钟说出来?
 you couldn't have spoken up ten seconds ago?

634
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,830
 你就可以帮我省下这100块钱了
 you could have saved me 100 bucks.

635
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:12,220
 蘑菇并不止能让人被石头砸死
 mushrooms weren't the only thing that got people stoned to death.

636
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:16,060
 紫曼陀罗 颠茄 曼德拉草根  还有发霉的面包
 jimson weed,belladonna,mandrake root,and moldy bread.

637
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,250
 是麦角中毒
 it's ergot poisoning.

638
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:18,360
 她吃的那种有机黑面包
 you'd need damp grain that had been- -

639
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,820
 是由完全没加工过的
 completely unprocessed and untreated like

640
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,370
 受潮的谷物而做成
 what's in that organic rye bread she's been eating.

641
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,820
 我该走人了吗?
 should I be going home?

642
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,770
 下班时间到了?
 is it 6:00?

643
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:29,850
 所以溴麦角环肽才加重了她的病情 这是一种麦角碱衍生物
 it's why she got worse on the bromocriptine- - it's an ergot derivative.

644
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:31,500
 50年内第一次出现这种病例
 there hasn't been a case in 50 years.

645
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,080
 她一直要喝牛奶  乳制品能中和毒性
 she kept asking for milk.  dairy products counteract the effects.

646
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,880
 你觉得她知道自己什么病 而且还自己进行治疗?
 you think she knew what she had and was treating it?

647
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,790
 渴求基于基本需要  这是人进化中所体现的本能而已
 cravings based on actual needs. it's a fairly common evolutionary development.

648
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,310
 你对进化论没意见吧?
 you okay with an answer based on evolution?

649
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:46,010
 没有
 yeah.

650
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,260
 伪君子
 hypocrite.

651
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:54,210
 这是用来做迷幻药用的 但我们的治疗能使你...
 it's the stuff they make lsd from. the treatment you're on should- -

652
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:57,110
 所以我一直只是在...兴奋而已?
 so I've just been... tripping?

653
00:36:57,110 --> 00:37:00,870
 这解释了幻觉 癫痫和妄想
 it explains the hallucinations,seizures,delusions.

654
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:03,810
 导致了血管的收缩  也解释了内脏的坏死
 constricts the blood vessels, which explains the necrosis.

655
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,240
 所以她不存在?
 she's not here?

656
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:22,050
 抱歉 是的
 I'm sorry. no.

657
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:27,400
 你愿意接受这种解释
 the fact that you're even willing to accept that answer

658
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,080
 说明药已经生效了
 means the medicine is starting to work.

659
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,840
 可你会活下去的
 but you'll live.

660
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:43,160
 你那么漂亮 Reena
 you're beautiful,reena.

661
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:46,640
 你也是 妈妈
 you too,mama.

662
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:21,110
 我会想念你的
 I'm going to miss you.

663
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:26,730
 妈妈
 mama.

664
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:04,570
 如你们所知 你们一共七人 然后...
 as you know,there are seven of you and...

665
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:07,800
 我只有六朵玫瑰
 only six roses.

666
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,990
 那些是牡丹
 those are peonies.

667
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:14,030
 但我肯定它们是玫瑰的同类
 but I'm sure they're part of the rose family.

668
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,810
 实际上 我很奇怪居然还有七个人在这儿
 actually,I'm surprised there are seven of you.

669
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,330
 你打了你老板 居然还跟没事一样的来了?
 you punch your boss and stick around?

670
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:27,030
 把花给我 然后闭嘴
 give me the flower and shut up.

671
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,850
 别太过火咯
 don't overdo it.

672
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,470
 我很想将你们全部人留下
 now I would love to keep all of you.

673
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,950
 但却无能为力
 but not enough to do anything about it.

674
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:38,870
 所以据我的仲裁计划  你们其中一人要走人
 so according to my arbitrary schedule,one of you has to go.

675
00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:00,040
 你开玩笑吧?
 you're kidding.

676
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,040
 我解出了答案
 I came up with the answer.

677
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,730
 我挖了坟 我...
 I robbed a grave. i- -

678
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:09,110
 在检查室摆了个狗圈 扰乱我思维
 planted a dog collar in the procedure room just to screw with my head.

679
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:11,500
 不 我才没...
 no,i never- -

680
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:15,140
 你不相信是她做的?
 you don't believe she did it?

681
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,940
 我当然肯定是她了
 I'm sure she did it.

682
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:19,520
 所以我才要给花她 干得漂亮
 that's why she's getting the flower. it was beautiful.

683
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,240
 虽然有点过分 不过她的确扰乱了你的思维
 she just overreached. she got into your head.

684
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,170
 没有
 no.

685
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,920
 她摆了你一道
 she owned you.

686
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,670
 心理暗示这招不错
 planting the idea was good.

687
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:28,560
 火上添油也做的不错
 letting it fester was good.

688
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,330
 不过放狗圈就愚蠢了
 leaving the collar was stupid.

689
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:33,520
 大家都知道 鬼才不会乱摆东西
 well known fact,ghosts don't leave things lying around.

690
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,610
 那么走人的是我咯?
 so am I gone then?

691
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:53,600
 噢天啊 我完全忘记你们两个了
 oh,my goodness. I had totally forgotten about you two.

692
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,540
 干的不错
 well played.

693
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:12,570
 抱歉 Henry
 sorry,henry.

694
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,980
 我们在一起过得很开心
 we had some giggles.

695
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:20,370
 他说的你全部都同意了 你们连说出来的话都一样
 you agreed with everything he said. you finished each other's sentences.

696
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:22,350
 所以我才出局了
 that's why I gotta go.

697
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:27,500
 你不需要别人来告诉你 已经知道的事情
 don't need someone to tell you what you're already thinking.

698
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,530
 有趣 我本来也要这么说
 funny,I was gonna say that.

699
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,790
 - 如果以后你想一起出去玩 - 恩 我知道了
 - if you want to hang out - yeah,I know.

700
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:37,370
 给Wilson打电话
 um,call wilson.

701
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:41,510
 其他人 明早8点
 rest of you,8:00 tomorrow.

702
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,430
 给钱就好了
 cash will be fine.

703
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,690
 估计你对每个男人都这么说
 I bet you say that to all the guys.

704
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,420
 沾满血泪的金钱 拿去吧
 take your blood money.

705
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:02,430
 下次你打算保护谁?
 who are you gonna protect next?

706
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:06,070
 要是告诉你了 还会管用吗?
 if I told you,it wouldn't work.

707
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:22,010
 我重新考虑了一下
 I've rethought some things.

708
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:23,200
 洗耳恭听
 glad to hear it.

709
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,600
 我打算回来工作 不过有几个条件
 I'm prepared to come back on a number of conditions.

710
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,020
 我想要你承诺过的加薪 再往上加5个百分点
 I want the raise you promised,plus five percent.

711
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:31,730
 我要独立办公室和私人助理
 I want my own office and a personal assistant.

712
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,700
 也不是不可接受
 it's not unreasonable.

713
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:38,060
 我会...一个都不满足你
 I will give you...  none of those.

714
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:41,470
 你可以回来 领原来的薪水
 you can come back at your original salary.

715
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:43,720
 怎么了?
 what's going on?

716
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:48,080
 你根本没重新考虑过 你只不过在别处吃了闭门羹而已
 you haven't rethought anything. you've just been blackballed.

717
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:50,600
 你现在是"House简化版"了
 you're "house light" now.

718
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:54,200
 只有雇用了"House原版"的人  才会愿意用你这种人
 the only administrator that will touch you is the one who hired "house classic.

719
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,350
 好消息是 她会假装她不是在帮你
 " good news is,she'll pretend she's not doing you a favor.

720
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:08,510
 我周一可以开始上班
 I can start monday.
