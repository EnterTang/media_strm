1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,493
(中央咖啡厅)

2
00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:09,241
摩妮卡,我可以借你的保时捷吗?
Monica? Hey, can I borrow the Porsche?

3
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:11,138
-好的 -太好了!
-Okay. -AII right!

4
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:13,711
有什么“不准”的呢?
But what is it not?

5
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:17,306
不准在车上和我女性朋友玩乐
A pIace to entertain my Iady friends.

6
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:22,411
-还有什么呢? -不准在车上吃义大利面
-And what eIse is it not? -A pIace to eat spaghetti.

7
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:25,216
非常好,你为什么会需要开车呢?
Very good. What do you need it for anyway?

8
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:27,859
超级大乐透奖金已经累积到三亿了
The PowerbaII Iottery is up to 300 miIIion...

9
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:32,531
-但是这里没有在卖彩券 -所以你要开车到康乃狄克州买?
-...and they don't seII tickets here. -So you're driving up to Connecticut?

10
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:35,929
对,康乃狄克州,不是西维吉尼亚
Yeah, Connecticut. Not West Virginia.

11
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:40,769
或许我可以开车载你去 我自己也想买几张彩券
Maybe I'II drive you up there. I'd Iike to buy some tickets myseIf.

12
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:45,339
钱德现在没有在赚钱 三亿对我们可是会很好用的
Yeah, with ChandIer not getting paid, we couId reaIIy use $300 miIIion.

13
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:50,449
是的,因为如果我还是在老工作 我们会说“要三亿吗?不用,谢谢”
Yes, because if I was at my oId job, we'd say, ''300 miIIion? No, thank you.''

14
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:54,344
-你可以帮我买吗? -对啊,我也要
-WiII you get me tickets too? -Yeah, me too.

15
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,216
-当然 -我有个点子
-Sure. -I have an idea.

16
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:59,654
我们可以各出资五十块 把钱集合起来
Why don't we aII pitch in 50 bucks, we'II pooI our money together...

17
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:03,523
-然后如果我们中奖,我们就照分 -这主意很棒!
-...and then if we win, we'II spIit it. -That's a great idea!

18
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,396
不用,谢了
No, thanks.

19
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,397
-你不想要中乐透吗? -我当然想
-You don't wanna win the Iottery? -Sure I do.

20
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,594
我还想当国王咧
I aIso want to be king of my own country...

21
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:14,535
探索第一位飞越大西洋的女飞行员 是怎么了
...and find out what happened to AmeIia Earhart.

22
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:18,304
-还在想女飞行员吗? -那女人就这样消失了!
-StiII on AmeIia Earhart? -The woman just vanished!

23
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:21,810
说真的,你真的不要加入吗?
SeriousIy, you don't want in on this?

24
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:24,916
不要,你们知道 中乐透的机率有多大吗?
No. Do you know what your odds are of winning the Iottery?

25
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:28,714
比你被闪电打到四十二次的机率还小
I mean, you have a better chance of being struck by Iightning 42 times.

26
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:32,085
但是我们有六个人 所以我们只需要被打到七次
But there's six of us, so we'd onIy have to get struck 7 times.

27
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:34,486
我喜欢这种机率!
I Iike those odds!

28
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:39,197
真的,你们,我不敢相信你们会 愿意花两百块钱在乐透上面
SeriousIy, you guys, I can't beIieve you're gonna spend $250 on the Iottery.

29
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:42,596
这实在太唬烂了吧?
I mean, that's such a bunch of boo-hockey.

30
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,873
我来问
I'II ask.

31
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,098
“唬烂”?
''Boo-hockey''?

32
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:53,238
我们认为艾玛已经快要开始说话了
Oh, we think Emma's about to start taIking...

33
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:57,042
所以在她面前我们会小心用字
...so we're trying to be carefuI about what words we use in front of her.

34
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,411
所以准备好 你们会听到很多的“胡说”…
So get ready to hear a Iot of boo-hockey...

35
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:02,180
“讨厌”还有“惹人烦”等等
...gosh darn it and brother pucker.

36
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,825
你怎么知道她要开始说话了呢?
How do you know she's gonna start taIking?

37
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:09,859
当我跟她说话时,我几乎可以感觉到 她听得懂我在说什么
When I taIk to her, I aImost feeI Iike she understands what I'm saying.

38
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:11,894
有点像乔伊
Kind of Iike Joey.

39
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,091
你说什么?
What's that now?

40
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,427
片名:六人行(第九季)

41
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:10,282
天啊,瞧瞧这全部的彩券 真是紧张刺激
God, Iook at aII these tickets. It's so exciting.

42
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,491
自从六年级后 我就没有赢过任何东西了
I haven't won anything since sixth grade.

43
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,990
吃派大赛吗?
Pie-eating contest?

44
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:20,321
因为我很胖,你就以为 那是我唯一能赢的比赛吗??
You assume because I was heavy that's the onIy way I couId win something?

45
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,525
不,我看过你埋在蓝莓派里面的照片
No, I saw a picture of you covered in bIueberries.

46
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:26,569
-那时候真快乐 -是啊
-That was a good day. -Yeah.

47
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:31,132
-他们在拖吊你的车! -我停在车库里面
-They're towing your car! -I'm parked in a garage on Morton.

48
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:34,538
他们正在拖吊一辆车
They're towing a car.

49
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:38,445
我眼花了
And I am seeing spots.

50
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:41,313
罗斯,你没有在带艾玛! 瑞秋,你也没有在带艾玛!
Ross, you don't have Emma! RacheI, you don't have Emma!

51
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:43,887
-艾玛呢?艾玛谁在带呢? -乔伊,别紧张
-Where's Emma? Who has Emma? -Joey, reIax.

52
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:48,357
我妈两小时前来带走她了 你也在场啊
My mother picked her up two hours ago. You were there.

53
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:52,160
-有吗? -是的,而且你还跟她说话
-I was? -Yes, and you taIked to her.

54
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,659
-我有吗? -她还带来了砂锅菜来
-I did? -She dropped off a casseroIe.

55
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:58,837
喔,对啊,那个砂锅女士
Oh, yeah, the casseroIe Iady.

56
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:01,403
你过来看我们中大奖的吗?
Did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?

57
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:02,897
制片:马克库尼尔斯
Yeah. And then I figured after you win, we can aII go out to the baIcony...

58
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,169
是啊,然后我想在你们中奖后 我们全部到阳台上…

59
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:06,972
看有小精灵…
...and see a night rainbow with gremIins dancing on top of it.

60
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,169
制片:丹娜克莱恩

61
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,009
在跳舞的夜间彩虹

62
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:13,249
别接电话!我来接!
Don't touch the phone! I'II get it!

63
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:14,542
制片:温蒂诺勒
-You think he washed his hands? -HeIIo?

64
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,348
-你觉得他有洗手吗? -哈?

65
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,888
-嘿,查理,有什么消息? -怎么回事?
-Hey, CharIie, what do you know? -What's going on?

66
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:20,181
编剧:雪瑞比尔星葛拉罕 艾伦普勒马
ChandIer's supposed to find out if he's getting a job at his agency.

67
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,328
钱德想知道他有没有得到 公司内部的一个工作机会

68

故事:布莱恩布肯纳 撒巴斯汀琼斯
But out of 1 5 interns, they're onIy hiring three.

69
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:24,891
但在十五名实习生中 他们只聘请三个人
-Tough odds. -Yeah.

70
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,895
-机率真小 -是啊

71
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,158
还真希望能像你们二十四州…
If onIy it were a sure thing Iike your 24-state Iottery.

72
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:29,390
导演:盖瑞哈佛森

73
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:30,866
联合彩券的机率一样高

74
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:35,704
是啊,瞧瞧谁想通了!
Yeah, Iook who's coming around!

75
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:39,605
该死,好啦,有更多消息再告诉我
Damn it. AII right, caII me when you know more.

76
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,814
-你有得到吗? -一个名额已经被占了
-Did you get it? -One of the sIots got fiIIed.

77
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:48,754
-被你吗? -注意我的语气
-By you? -Sense the tone.

78
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:53,583
-不是,一个叫做奈特的小子 -喔,我讨厌那个人
-No, that kid Nate got it. -Oh, I hate that guy.

79
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,991
我是说,真是的,小子 穿上裤子吧!
I mean, come on, kid, puII up your pants!

80
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:59,063
还有两个名额不是吗?
WeII, there's two spots Ieft, right?

81
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:01,893
是啊,我真的好想要,我想要被录取
Yeah. I mean, I want this so much. I wanna get one.

82
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,263
也希望我朋友查理被录取
I want my friend CharIie to get one.

83
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,530
其实我不是很在乎查理
Except I don't care about CharIie.

84
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,466
-嘿,你们好 -嘿!
-Hey, you guys. -Hey!

85
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,406
你们不会相信的 我刚刚去找过我的算命师
You are not gonna beIieve this. I just saw my psychic...

86
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:16,446
她说我今晚一定会中乐透!
...and she said I was definiteIy gonna win the Iottery tonight!

87
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,910
我想要增加好运…
I thought we couId use some extra Iuck...

88
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:22,111
所以从餐厅带幸运骨头回来
...so I brought a wishbone home from work.

89
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:28,784
算命师跟幸运骨头? 拜给别人一点机会吧
A psychic and a wishbone? Guys, give someone eIse a chance.

90
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:31,320
-好了,谁要来做呢? -我可以吗?
-AII right, who wants to do it? -Can I?

91
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:34,499
素食者从来就没有机会玩幸运骨头
Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone.

92
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,534
真是不公平,我们只是不吃肉
It's reaIIy not fair. Just because we don't eat the meat...

93
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:40,764
不代表我们不喜欢玩骨头
...doesn't mean we don't Iike to pIay with the carcasses.

94
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,103
好了,瑞秋呢?
AII right. Rach?

95
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:45,675
我不想要双手沾满火鸡的味道
I don't want that turkey smeII aII over my hands.

96
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:49,439
我来,我要把砂锅菜的味道盖过去
I'II do it! It'II get the casseroIe stink off of mine.

97
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:54,512
-希望我会赢 -嗯,没有关系
-I hope I win. -WeII, it doesn't reaIIy matter.

98
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,655
你们的愿望是一样的
You're both wishing for the same thing.

99
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:01,623
我不能告诉你我许什么愿 要不然不会实现的
I can't teII you what I'm wishing for, or eIse, you know, it won't come true.

100
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:04,862
对,但是我们都知道你许什么愿
Right. But we know what you're wishing for.

101
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:08,033
-我不能说 -我了解
-I can't reaIIy say. -I understand.

102
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,726
但是你许的愿 跟我们想的一样,不是吗?
But you're wishing for what we think, aren't you?

103
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,700
我真的很不喜欢这些问题!
I'm not reaIIy comfortabIe with these questions!

104
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,966
-拜! -赶快做!
-PIease! -Just do it!

105
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:18,143
好的,一,二,三
Okay. One, two, three.

106
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,211
我赢了!嘿!
I won! Hey!

107
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,508
你们知道吗?我确定 你们的愿望会成真
You know what? I'm sure your wish is gonna come true.

108
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:28,552
但是,为了以防万一 我们来磨擦这个灯,或许精灵会出现
But, you guys, just in case, maybe a genie wiII come out if we rub this Iamp.

109
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,881
那东西好烫!
That thing gets hot!

110
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,719
罗斯,继续说你的笑话吧
Ross, just keep making your jokes.

111
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,123
如果我们中了 你有什么感受?
How are you gonna feeI if we actuaIIy do win?

112
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:39,492
-你们不会中的 -我知道机率很小
-You're not gonna win. -I know the odds are against us...

113
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:43,829
但是总是有人会中,可能就是我们 然后你会觉得如何呢?
...but somebody has to win, and it couId be us. And then how you gonna feeI?

114
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:47,734
我们会说“大家开直升机去海角玩吧”
We're gonna be Iike, ''Everybody, Iet's take our heIicopters up to the Cape.''

115
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,273
而你只能说喔,我不行…
And you're gonna be aII, Iike, ''Oh, I can't, guys.

116
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:53,674
我们到那边碰面好了 我先帮我的车子加满油
I'II have to meet you up there. I gotta gas up the Hyundai.''

117
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:01,845
好了,我听过自己在录音带里的声音 我听起来根本不像那样
Okay, I've heard myseIf on tape, and I sound nothing Iike that.

118
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,215
我可以想像头条新闻是 彩券赢家的朋友…
I can see the headIine now: ''Lottery Winners' Friend...

119
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,791
充满懊悔,吃下自己的手臂
...FiIIed With Regret, Eats Own Arm.''

120
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:09,961
我为什么要吃自己的手臂?
Why wouId I eat my own arm?

121
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:13,757
你当然不会,但是报纸是我们的 我们爱怎么写就怎么写
WeII, you wouIdn't, but we own the paper. We can print whatever we want.

122
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,561
你知道吗?我帮你出五十块好了
You know what? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you.

123
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:19,170
-为什么? -因为我知道你认为…
-Why? -Because I know that you think...

124
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:22,398
乐透是很唬烂的东西
...that the Iottery is boo-hockey...

125
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:26,302
但是我们全都聚在一起 看开奖,会很好玩的
...but we're aII here, and we're gonna watch the numbers and have fun.

126
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,472
而你是我哥哥,我希望你能参与
And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.

127
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:34,914
你不需要这样做的,我可以自己出钱
You don't have to do that. I mean, I'II pay for myseIf.

128
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:38,955
但是你想要让我跟你们一起同乐 真的是太窝心了
But just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys, that's so sweet.

129
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,752
过来
Come here.

130
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,262
去开个房间吧
Get a room.

131
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,262
那既然你已经加入了 要是中奖,你要做什么事呢?
So now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win?

132
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:55,100
-我不知道,或许投资吧 -对,要冷静
-I don't know. I'II probabIy just invest it. -CaIm down.

133
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:58,072
正经点,你的梦想呢?投资?
SeriousIy, that's your fantasy? To invest it?

134
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:02,976
喔,我很抱歉,我是说投资吗? 我的意思是“快乐的全部花光光”
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I say, ''invest it''? I meant, ''Be cooI and piss it aII away.''

135
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:08,913
我知道了!我们该把全部的钱凑起来 买下尼克队!
I know! We shouId pooI aII our money and buy the Knicks!

136
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:11,120
我不是很在乎尼克队
I don't reaIIy care about the Knicks.

137
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,259
如果我选你当前锋,你就会了
You wiII when I pick you as starting forward.

138
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,653
你会那样做吗?我从没有被选上!
You wouId do that? I never get picked!

139
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:21,189
我不确定球队会是正确的选择
I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go.

140
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:24,734
你不让我买尼克队吗? 我不敢相信你要打碎我的梦想
You won't Iet me buy the Knicks? I can't beIieve you're taking this away.

141
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:28,963
你说的对,这个梦想 已经有十五秒之久了
You're right, it has been your dream for over 1 5 seconds.

142
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:33,233
他们还有多久才会公布号码呢?妈咪
How Iong untiI they announce the numbers, Mommy?

143
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:37,773
这个也让我来 什么“妈咪”啊?
I'II take this one too. ''Mommy''?

144
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,976
喔,我已经习惯叫瑞秋…
Oh, I've gotten into the habit of caIIing RacheI...

145
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:43,212
“妈咪”,只要是艾玛在场
...''Mommy'' when we're around Emma.

146
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:47,291
我现在发现她并不在
Which I now reaIize we are not.

147
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:51,830
我希望如果她听久了 这将成为她第一句会说的话
I'm hoping that if she hears it enough, it'II be her first word.

148
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:56,195
如果我们真的要这样做 你也应该叫我“爹地”才对
AIthough if we're gonna do that, we shouId probabIy caII me ''Daddy'' too.

149
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,193
我喜欢,爹地
I Iike that, Daddy.

150
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,810
我只是在说瑞秋
I was just taIking about RacheI.

151
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:08,879
爹地生气了吗?
Is Daddy getting angry?

152
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:13,411
爹地要打我吗?
Is Daddy gonna spank me?

153
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,584
嗯,要看情况
WeII, that depends.

154
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,520
你是不是坏…? 不,我演不下去了
Have you been a bad--? No, I can't.

155
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:28,194
哈?哈?嘿,查理 还有其他人知道吗?
HeIIo? HeIIo? Hey, CharIie. Did anybody eIse hear?

156
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,726
什么?苏珊拿到了?怎么会呢?
What? Susan got it? How?

157
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:35,032
喔,天啊,早知道我也跟他上床!
Oh, man, I wouId've sIept with him!

158
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:37,833
好了,拜
AII right, bye.

159
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,039
老兄,我很抱歉 但是,还有一个名额不是吗?
Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot Ieft, right?

160
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:43,909
-查理会得到的 -嘿,别那样说
-WeII, CharIie's gonna get that. -Hey, don't say that.

161
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,745
你也有机会得到那工作的
You've got just as good a chance of getting that job.

162
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,614
他是老板的貌子
He is the boss' son.

163
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:51,713
-好了,乐透! -是啊!
-Come on, Iottery! -Yeah!

164
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:54,587
-再大概二十分钟就开奖了 -好了,我们来吧
-It starts in, Iike, 20 minutes. -Okay, here we go.

165
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,127
我们需要快点分配这些彩券来对奖
We need to sort through the tickets quickIy to see if we've won.

166
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:01,027
有人有什么主意要怎么安排吗?
So does anybody have any ideas how to organize this?

167
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,361
好的,看看这样如何
Okay, how about this:

168
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:06,195
我们分成六组各四十张
We divide them into six groups of 40.

169
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:09,398
剩下的十张就由先对完的人来对
The remaining 1 0 can be read by whoever finishes first.

170
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,373
-我还有一个主意 -很抱歉,提议时间已经过了
-I have another idea. -I'm sorry, idea time is over.

171
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,915
-所有的彩券都在碗里了吗? -是的
-WeII, are aII the tickets in the bowI? -Yeah.

172
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:20,574
-那床头柜上面的那些呢? -那边没有彩券
-What about the ones on the nightstand? -There are no tickets there.

173
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,550
是的,那边有 我几分钟前才看到
Yes, there are. I just saw them a few minutes ago.

174
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:27,121
不对,没有,你看错了
No, you didn't. You must be mistaken.

175
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:31,093
-床头柜上有二十张彩券 -钱德,注意我的语气
-There are 20 tickets on the nightstand. -ChandIer, sense the tone.

176
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:36,963
喔,喔,喔,瞧瞧妈咪找到了什么
WeII, weII, weII. Look what Mommy found.

177
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:41,304
好啦,我帮自己跟钱德多买了二十张
Okay, fine. I bought 20 extra tickets for me and ChandIer.

178
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:45,235
算命的还说我会被朋友给背叛
The psychic aIso said that I wouId be betrayed.

179
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:49,813
我不敢相信,我以为我们是一起的
I can't beIieve this. I thought we were aII in this together.

180
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:53,349
-嘿,你五分钟前才加入的! -是三分钟!
-Hey, you just got in five minutes ago! -Three minutes ago!

181
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,079
我不知道那有什么重要的
I don't know why that's important.

182
00:10:56,288 --> 00:11:00,418
我一直都跟你在一起 你是什么时候买的?
I was with you the whoIe time. When did you even get those?

183
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:05,120
当你在看未拆封的色情书刊的时候
When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the pIastic.

184
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:07,193
我再分给你看
I'II show you how.

185
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,466
好了,摩妮卡 假设你的彩券中奖了怎么办?
Okay. WeII, Monica, suppose one of your speciaI tickets wins?

186
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:14,470
你觉得中了彩券 失去了朋友又怎样?
How are you gonna feeI when you win and Iose your friends?

187
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:18,474
拜,如果我中奖了 你们才不会离开我
PIease. If I win the Iottery, you guys are not gonna Ieave me.

188
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:22,808
有人上星期给我一堆松饼 害我整整三天都被你们骚扰!
Someone gave me muffins Iast week, and I couIdn't get rid of you for three days!

189
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:27,113
钱德,你可以告诉她这是不对的吗?
ChandIer, wouId you just teII her what she did was wrong?

190
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:30,186
她说的对,你不应该 帮我们两个另买彩券
She's right. You shouIdn't have bought tickets just for us.

191
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,015
让我说完
Let me finish.

192
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,819
然而,看起来我好像得不到这份工作了
However, it doesn't Iook Iike I'm gonna get this job...

193
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:39,328
所以我不能太有原则 去你们的!彩券是我们的!
...so I can't afford to have principIes. So screw you! The tickets are ours!

194
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,859
这才是我嫁的好男人
There's the man I married.

195
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:45,399
好了,相信我,如果你们中奖了
AII right. BeIieve me, if you win the Iottery...

196
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:47,562
你们就跟我们不是朋友了
...it's the Iast you're gonna hear from us.

197
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:52,506
无所谓,不要当我的朋友就算了 我会买新朋友的
Fine. Don't be my friends. I'II buy new friends.

198
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:57,682
是的,我还会付钱让他们动整形手术 让他们看起来跟你们一模一样!
Yeah, and then I'II pay for their pIastic surgery so they Iook just Iike you!

199
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,478
你知道吗?我要拿回我的份
You know what? I want my share of the tickets.

200
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,144
我也要拿回我的彩券! 而且我要买下尼克队!
I want my tickets too! And I'm buying the Knicks!

201
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:05,756
还有葛拉芙!
And Steffi Graf!

202
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,324
太好了,那我也要拿回我的! 而且如果我中奖…
CooI. Then I want mine too! And if I win...

203
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:11,657
我要拿全部的钱去买低利公债!
...I'm gonna put it aII into a very Iow-yieId bond!

204
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:16,198
不行,我们必须要 把全部的彩券集合在一起
No. You guys, we gotta keep aII the tickets together.

205
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,393
不,我们应该分一分
No. No, we shouId divide them up...

206
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,005
而且我应该多分点 因为是开我的车买的!
...and I shouId get extra because we used my car!

207
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,903
嘿!嘿!如果有人可以多拿一些 那个人应该是我!
Hey! Hey! If anybody gets extra tickets, it shouId be me!

208
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:28,706
-这整件事都是我想出来的! -是啊,谢谢你发明乐透!
-This whoIe thing was my idea! -Yeah. Thanks for inventing the Iottery!

209
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:32,250
把彩券给我,我来分!
Just give them to me, and I'II spIit them up!

210
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,679
嘿,嘿!
Hey, hey!

211
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:40,382
天啊,我再也受不了了! 我来结束这一切!
God, I can't take it anymore! I'm putting an end to this!

212
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,926
-如果她跳楼了,她的彩券就是我的! -等等,不!嘿!
-Okay, if she jumps, I get her tickets! -Wait, no, no! Hey!

213
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:48,723
如果我们不要一起合资 那我们就什么都不要
If we're not doing this together, we're not doing it at aII.

214
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:51,233
-跟你们的彩券说再见吧 -不!不!不!
-Say goodbye to your tickets. -No! No! No!

215
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,031
不要再靠近过来了!
Do not come any cIoser!

216
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:57,903
我可以再靠近一点点吗? 我的宝贝被压到了
Can I come a IittIe bit cIoser? VaIuabIe things are getting squished.

217
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,772
现在,什么比较重要? 朋友还是钱?
Now, what's more important, your friends or money?

218
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:03,379
-朋友! -钱!
-Friends! -Money!

219
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:08,243
朋友
Friends.

220
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,555
嘿,摩妮卡,那你其它的彩券呢?
Hey, Monica, what about your extra tickets?

221
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:13,554
全都在里面了
They're aII in there.

222
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,826
-还有我内衣藏的这五张 -摩妮卡!
-Even these five that I hid in my bra. -Monica!

223
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,828
好的,很好,你们都吓坏了
Okay. Good. You guys were so scared.

224
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:23,831
我根本不可能会丢掉这些…
There is no way I was gonna dump this--

225
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:26,334
天啊!不!
God! No!

226
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,970
我想我把你的碗摔破了
I think I broke your bowI.

227
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,940
快、快、快!
Go! Go! Go!

228
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:51,324
到街上去找彩券 真是美好的夜晚啊
What a beautifuI night to be running around the street, Iooking for tickets.

229
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:54,292
而且被风一吹就更有趣了
And the wind sure made it fun.

230
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:57,534
-菲比,有一半不见了 -那又如何呢?
-Phoebe, we Iost haIf of them. -So what?

231
00:13:57,703 --> 00:13:59,864
摩妮卡,我们还是会中奖的
Monica, we have the winning ticket.

232
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:03,508
算命师说我会中奖的,记得吗?
My psychic said I was gonna win, remember?

233
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:08,204
奇怪的是 算命师并没有算到可怕的鸽子
Weird your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon.

234
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:12,543
事实上她是有说过 我会那样死去
As a matter of fact, she said that's how I'm going to die.

235
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:17,018
所以,原谅我有点被吓到
So excuse me for being a IittIe skittish.

236
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,350
有两通留言,可能是工作的消息
There's two messages. This couId be from work.

237
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:23,222
-喔,放来听听 -好了,来了
-Oh, pIay them. -Okay. Here we go.

238
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:30,132
哈,我是阳台上的鸽子 打电话过来道歉的
Hello. This is the pigeon from the balcony calling to apologize.

239
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:36,041
我不应该把彩券 从那个漂亮小姐手中弄翻
I shouldn't have knocked the tickets out of the pretty lady's hand.

240
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:41,237
这全是我的错,不关她的事,拜
It was all my fault. Not hers. Bye.

241
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:50,249
嗯,我敢说要这样道歉 一定很难
WeII, I bet that was very hard for him to do.

242
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,019
嘿,钱德,我是查理
Hey, Chandler, it's Charlie.

243
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:56,058
就是这个了
This is it.

244
00:14:56,228 --> 00:15:00,392
听着,结果是我拿到最后的名额
Listen, it turns out I got the last spot.

245
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,399
我很抱歉,老兄 很高兴跟你共事过
I'm really sorry, man. It was a lot of fun working with you.

246
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,037
再打电话给我吧
Give me a call if you want.

247
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:08,935
天啊,我很难过,亲爱的
Gosh, I'm so sorry, honey.

248
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:10,665
真替你难过,钱德
Sorry, ChandIer.

249
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:15,746
这真是不公平,这就像那次 他们升珊卓,而不是我一样
It is so unfair. It's Iike that time they promoted Saundra over me at work.

250
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:17,677
她跟洛夫罗伦有亲戚关系吗?
Was she reIated to RaIph Lauren?

251
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:21,546
没有,只是她工作能力比我强太多了
No, she was just much better at her job than me.

252
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:24,153
你们大家,快要开奖了
You guys, the drawing's about to start.

253
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:26,757
我们应该打电话给我妈 跟艾玛说晚安
We shouId caII my mom's and say good night to Emma...

254
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,951
-赶在她睡着以前 -好主意
-...before she goes down. -Good idea.

255
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:32,259
亲爱的,面对这件事你真的很坚强
Honey, you're being reaIIy strong about this.

256
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,956
我知道你很想要这份工作
I know how badIy you wanted that job.

257
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,964
是啊,你知道的 我真的以为这是该给我的
Yeah, you know, I reaIIy thought I deserved it.

258
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:43,572
让我们来中乐透吧 我们还有一百三十个机会不是吗?
But Iet's go win the Iottery. I mean, we stiII have a 1 30 chances to win, right?

259
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,610
一百三十一个
Hundred and thirty-one.

260
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:51,243
是的,晚安甜心,我爱你
Yeah, good night, sweetheart. I Iove you.

261
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:55,251
还有记住,你是爹地的小女孩
And remember, you're Daddy's IittIe girI.

262
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:58,413
菲比完全毁了“爹地”
Phoebe's totaIIy ruined that for me.

263
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:03,217
嗨,妈,让艾玛听
Hi, Mom. Put her back on.

264
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:05,386
瑞秋,他们在开奖了!
Rach, they're announcing the numbers!

265
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:09,589
我的天啊,我可以感到自己在改变了
My God, I can aIready feeI myseIf changing.

266
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:13,904
这里是正式超级大乐透中奖号码 我们有五十三
Here are your official Powerball numbers. We have 53.

267
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:16,597
-我有 -我们也有一个!
-I've got that. -We have one too!

268
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:19,573
我们快中奖了!
We are on the road, peopIe!

269
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:21,937
快点!
Come on!

270
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:27,608
妈,拜,我知道你喜欢你的新嘴唇 但是我不太懂你在说什么
Mom, pIease, I know you Iove your new Iips, but I can bareIy understand you.

271
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:30,914
你可以让我跟我女貌道晚安吗?
WouId you pIease just Iet me say good night to my daughter?

272
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:33,489
然后接下来的号码是七
And here we go. The Powerball is seven.

273
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:37,423
好了,你们快对号码! 让我发财吧!
AII right, check your numbers! Make me rich.

274
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,855
你们大家,你们不会相信这个的
You guys, you're not gonna beIieve this.

275
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:44,434
我刚刚在跟艾玛说晚安的时候 她说了第一句话
I was just saying good night to Emma, and she said her first words.

276
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,737
-什么? -那她说了什么呢?
-What? -WeII, what did she say?

277
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,772
她说了“葛利巴”!
She said, ''GIeba'' !

278
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,842
让我发财吧!
Make me rich!

279
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:59,849
-是不是很惊人呢? -是啊,真是太棒了
-Isn't that amazing? -Oh, yeah. No, no, no, that's great.

280
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,748
为什么你没有很兴奋呢?
Why aren't you more excited?

281
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:06,185
瑞秋,葛利巴不算一句话
Rach, gIeba is not a word.

282
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:10,618
-它当然算 -好吧,那它是什么意思呢?
-WeII, of course it is. -Okay. What does it mean?

283
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:13,855
嗯,我又不认识所有的字词
WeII, I don't know aII the words.

284
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:17,724
我只是很高兴我没有错过 我女貌说第一句话
You know, I'm just gIad I didn't miss my daughter's first word.

285
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:22,272
-你就是错过了!葛利巴算! -好的,那用它造句
-Yes you did! GIeba is a word! -Okay. Use it in a sentence.

286
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:26,274
好的,艾玛刚刚说了“葛利巴”
Okay. Emma just said, ''GIeba.''

287
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:33,307
-那不算说话 -好的,我来查字典
-It's not a word. -Okay, fine. I'm gonna Iook it up.

288
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:35,009
好的,太好了
Okay, great.

289
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,314
顺便查一下 有天她也说了另外一句…
WhiIe you're at it, she said another word the other day.

290
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,515
你何不也查查看这个:
Why don't you Iook up:

291
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:49,199
好了,葛利巴,葛利巴,葛利巴!
AII right. Okay. Okay. GIeba. GIeba. GIeba. GIeba!

292
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:54,805
找到了!“含孢子的丰厚菌种”
Here it is! ''The fIeshy, spore-bearing inner mass of a certain fungi.''

293
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:03,105
她会成为科学家的
She's gonna be a scientist.

294
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,914
-该死的,有人有对到吗? -没有
-Damn it. Anybody got anything? -No.

295
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,253
我还在对我的
I'm stiII Iooking through mine.

296
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:18,624
再对一次,没有
Just doubIe-checking. No.

297
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:21,732
没有,没有
No. No.

298
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,597
没有!
No!

299
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,608
哈?等一下
HeIIo? HoId on.

300
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,042
是你老板
It's your boss.

301
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,775
“很抱歉没用你”的电话来了
The ''I'm sorry I rejected you'' phone caII.

302
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,579
我还真不习惯男生打这种电话来
I'm not used to getting these from guys.

303
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,112
-嘿,史提夫 -钱德,嗨
-Hey, Steve. -ChandIer, hi.

304
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,225
我想你已经听说我们三个名额都满了
I'm sure you've heard we fiIIed the three positions.

305
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:50,725
我们觉得以你的成熟度及经验
We feIt that with your maturity and experience...

306
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:53,364
你不会想要当助理的
...you wouIdn't be happy being someone's assistant.

307
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:56,125
我爱死当助理了,接听电话…
I'd Iove to be somebody's assistant. Answering phones...

308
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,132
倒咖啡,我就是为那些工作而活的
...getting coffee, I Iive for that stuff.

309
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:03,240
而且我并没有很成熟 放屁、咪咪、屁蛋!
And I'm not too mature. Farts, boobies, butt cracks!

310
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:08,576
钱德,你是全部的人里面最优秀的
ChandIer, you were the strongest person in the program.

311
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:12,183
我们要聘请你当初级广告文案
We're offering you the position of junior copywriter.

312
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,649
我?那个刚刚才说“屁蛋”的人?
Me? That guy who just said, ''butt cracks''?

313
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,016
是的,没错
Yes, that's right.

314
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,589
我们很期望你能带给这份工作…
We're excited about the IeveI of sophistication...

315
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:23,091
一定程度的深度
...you'II be bringing to the job.

316
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:28,159
好的,谢谢,你不会失望的 明天见
Okay. WeII, thanks, you won't regret it. I'II see you tomorrow.

317
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,307
怎样?
What?

318
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:45,211
对,我要当初级广告文案了
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a junior copywriter.

319
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,487
恭喜了!亲爱的,我真以你为荣
CongratuIations! Oh, sweetie, I'm so proud of you.

320
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:52,283
谢谢,这表示我今晚可以被爱爱吗?
Thanks. Does that mean I get the good Ioving tonight?

321
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:56,291
当然,不看电视或什么其它的
You bet. No TV or anything.

322
00:19:56,962 --> 00:20:00,295
-嘿,恭喜你找到工作了 -谢了,老兄
-Hey, that is so great about the job. -Thanks, man.

323
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:02,626
我其实也有帮到忙
I'd Iike to think I had something to do with it.

324
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:06,031
-真的吗?怎么说? -刚刚在玩幸福骨头的时候…
-ReaIIy? Why? -WeII, before with the wishbone.

325
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:11,973
我没有许愿我们中乐透 我许的愿是你找到工作
I didn't wish we wouId win the Iottery. I wished you'd get the job.

326
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:14,469
喔,是吗?
Oh, yeah?

327
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,316
听着,别告诉摩妮卡 她会把你的心脏挖出来的
Listen, don't teII Monica. She'II rip your heart right out.

328
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:23,477
你们知道吗?我一直有一点点感觉
WeII, you know what? There was a IittIe part of me...

329
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,714
觉得我们好像真的会中奖
...that reaIIy thought we were gonna win.

330
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:32,386
我也是,都是为了我的恐龙与 女飞行员主题公园
Me too. So much for my dinosaur/ AmeIia Earhart theme park.

331
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:36,990
You guys? What was the PowerbaII number again?

332
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:39,729
-七 -我们中奖了
-Seven. -We won.

333
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:41,835
-什么? -我们中奖了!
-What? -We won!

334
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,703
-让我看,让我看 -别撕掉了
-Let me see! Let me see! -Don't tear it!

335
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,877
菲比,你其它五个号码都不对!
Phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers!

336
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:56,217
我知道,但是我们中了特别号 我们中了三块钱!
I know that, but Iook, we got the PowerbaII number. We won $3!

337
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:01,185
哇,你觉得我们应该分二十年提领 还是一次领光呢?
Wow, you think we shouId get that over 20 years or go for the big payout?

338
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,990
我不管,我从来就没有 中过任何东西,我真不敢相信!
I don't care. I've never won anything before. I can't beIieve this!

339
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:08,428
菲比,你要怎么运用这三块钱呢?
So, Pheebs, what are you gonna do with your $3?

340
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:12,900
又不是全都是我的 我们每个人都有五十分
WeII, it's not aII mine. We aII get 50 cents.

341
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:15,432
你知道吗?我的份给你
You know what? You can have mine.

342
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,869
-我的也是 -我的也是
-Me too. -Me too.

343
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,272
我的也是
Me too.

344
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:26,949
好吧,既然大家都要给你
WeII, I guess if everybody eIse is.

345
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,487
(中央咖啡厅)

346
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,997
嘿,我刚刚打电话给乐透公司
Hey, guys. So I just caIIed the PowerbaII hot Iine.

347
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:44,462
-你们敢相信吗?没有人中奖耶 -我希望不是那样
-Can you beIieve it? Nobody won. -I beg to differ.

348
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,600
或许没有人中头奖 但是稍早有个人在这里…
Maybe nobody won the jackpot, but there was this guy in here earIier...

349
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:54,678
在外面捡到一张彩券 中了一万块钱
...and he found a ticket on the street right outside and won $ 1 0,000.

350
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:09,317
不要再责怪漂亮小姐了
Again, don't bIame the pretty Iady.

351
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:14,632
那不是她的错,是鸽子我的错
It was not her fauIt. It was me, the pigeon.

352
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:20,194
真的,不要再瞪她了
SeriousIy, stop staring at her.
