It took you 45 minutes to cross a street.

3
00:00:10,006 --> 00:00:12,741

我似乎是没有选择,不是吗?
WeII, I kind of have to, don't I?

11
00:00:38,566 --> 00:00:41,502
都是因为这个愚蠢的东西
Because of this stupid thing.

12
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:47,975
再也没有比爱妻的支持 更棒的东西了
There's nothing Iike the support of your Ioving wife, huh?

21
00:01:19,673 --> 00:01:22,242
喔,天啊,那真的是不太可能
Oh, God, that is so not gonna happen.

22
00:01:24,645 --> 00:01:26,913
我真不敢相信你们要搬走了

26
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:25,736
你知道吗? 我不确定可不可以喝有咖啡因的东西
You know what? I'm not even sure I can have caffeine.

27
00:02:25,904 --> 00:02:29,940
我养育班还有凯萝的经验告诉我 一杯咖啡不会影响你的母乳的
I went through this with Ben and CaroI. One coffee won't affect your miIk.

28
00:02:30,141 --> 00:02:34,077
为了安全起见 我要打电话给歪愣医师
Just to be sure, I'm gonna caII Dr. Wiener.

29
00:02:37,748 --> 00:02:40,150
这么好笑吗?
Every time?

30
00:02:40,718 --> 00:02:43,921
没有必要每次有问题 都打电话给他,好吗?
You don't have to caII him whenever you have a question, okay?

31
00:02:44,087 --> 00:02:48,891
-相信我,我是有经验的 -好吧,我相信你
-Trust me. I know this. -AII right. I trust you.

有人的名字叫“歪愣” 真是笑死我了

40
00:03:09,546 --> 00:03:13,750
-瞧瞧你就像个大人 -事实上,你知道吗?
-Look at you aII grownup. -WeII, actuaIIy, you know what?

41
00:03:14,216 --> 00:03:15,717

编剧:布莱恩布肯纳 撒巴斯汀琼斯
...that maybe I'm ready for a more serious reIationship, you know?

45
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,624
或许我已经准备好 要接受更认真的交往了

46

善良、成熟、稳重的女孩子
And Iooks aren't as important as....

49
00:03:26,462 --> 00:03:29,564
外表并不是非常…

50
00:03:29,931 --> 00:03:31,499
不,她一定要很辣才行
Nah, she's gotta be hot.

51
00:03:32,468 --> 00:03:34,502
我也许认识这样的人
You know, I might know somebody.

52
00:03:34,703 --> 00:03:37,472
要不要你帮我找个对象 然后我们一起两对约会

Rach, you can't caII peopIe at 3:00 in the morning.

80

You know what? You sound just Iike his wife.

81
00:05:24,175 --> 00:05:26,242
艾玛有怎样吗?

打嗝
Hiccups.

我告诉过你了,不能每次 有鸡毛蒜皮小事都打电话给他
I toId you, you can't caII him every time any IittIe thing comes up.

86
00:05:39,723 --> 00:05:43,726
看来我是真的不能了 他不接我们了!
WeII, not anymore I can't. He fired us!

87

你敢相信吗?

88
00:05:46,097 --> 00:05:50,267
我敢相信如果他在这里 一定会用杂志砸你的头
I couId beIieve it if he came here and hit you over the head with a copy of Highlights.

89
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:53,536
我们该怎么办呢? 我们得再另找一个小貌科医师了
What are we gonna do? We have to find a pediatrician.

90
00:05:53,704 --> 00:05:56,339
等一下,摩妮卡说你们小时候…

91
00:05:56,507 --> 00:05:58,775

93
00:06:01,344 --> 00:06:04,013

Yeah, no, I don't think that's a good idea.

94
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,516
事实上,我想他死了
In fact, I think he's dead.

95
00:06:06,682 --> 00:06:08,750
为什么坏事都发生在我身上?
Why does everything happen to me?

96

But I gotta get up earIy, and I'm not feeIing weII.

98

你不舒服? 是怎么回事呢?德国麻疹吗?
You're not feeIing weII? What do you have? RubeIIa?

99
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:22,398
别靠近艾玛 她还没有注射预防针
Because don't go near Emma, she has not had that shot.

100
00:06:22,698 --> 00:06:26,535
我仔细想想 倒还感觉像是德国麻疹
You know, come to think of it, it does feeI rubeIIa-Iike.

Damn it! Is there no mystery Ieft in romance anymore?!

124

00:08:33,391 --> 00:08:36,060
所以这就是带孩子,是吧?
So this is being a parent, huh?

129
00:08:36,427 --> 00:08:39,463
我想我可以处理得很好的
I think I can handIe this.

130
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,631
太难了,太难了
Too intense. Too intense.

131
00:08:45,903 --> 00:08:47,071
好了,我说了
WeII, I did it.

132
00:08:47,237 --> 00:08:50,006
我告诉餐厅的班底 我要搬到土尔沙了
I toId my crew at the restaurant I'm heading off to TuIsa.

133
00:08:50,174 --> 00:08:53,810
-是吗?他们反应如何? -还不错
-Oh, yeah? How'd they take it. -Pretty weII. Yeah.

134
00:08:53,978 --> 00:08:56,413
他们是勇敢的小尖兵
They were brave IittIe soIdiers.

135
00:08:57,647 --> 00:08:59,615
尽全力冷静
Did their best to be stoic.

136
00:08:59,783 --> 00:09:02,751
有些还互相击掌来掩饰离别的伤痛
Some of them even high-fived each other to mask their pain.

137
00:09:05,322 --> 00:09:09,526
要找好医生真是好难 要如何分辨哪个是好医生…
It's impossibIe to find a good doctor. How do you know the good ones...

138
00:09:09,693 --> 00:09:13,296
哪个又会拿小弟弟 摩擦你的膝盖呢?
...from the ones who'II push their penis against your knee?

139
00:09:14,698 --> 00:09:15,765
什么?
Excuse me?

140
00:09:15,932 --> 00:09:18,167
我知道她的意思
I know what she's taIking about.

141
00:09:20,203 --> 00:09:24,373
你们或许也碰过 会毛手毛脚的钢琴老师吧
You probabIy aIso had the piano teacher with the wandering hands.

142
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:31,513
我们要找新的小貌科医生
WeII, we've gotta find a new pediatrician.

143
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,716
罗斯昨晚不舒服 艾玛或许也被感染到了
Ross was getting sick Iast night, and Emma may have caught it.

144
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:37,819
-你为什么不去找葛曼医生呢? -罗斯说他死了
-Why don't you see Dr. GettIeman? -Ross said he died.

145
00:09:37,986 --> 00:09:41,055
他没死 我上星期才遇到他女貌
He didn't die. I just saw his daughter Iast week.

146
00:09:41,223 --> 00:09:46,661
她说他很好,但是她呢 可被肉毒杆菌搞惨了
She said he was fine. Her, on the other hand, botched Botox.

147
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:49,531
太好了,那我要带艾玛去找他
Great. WeII then, I'm gonna take Emma to see him.

148
00:09:49,697 --> 00:09:51,498
为什么罗斯说他死了呢?
I wonder why Ross said that he died?

149
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:54,535
或许他把他跟 他小时候的心理医生搞混了
Maybe he confused him with his chiIdhood therapist.

150
00:09:54,702 --> 00:09:55,837
他有心理医生?
He saw a therapist?

151
00:09:56,003 --> 00:09:58,972
他以前常常做重复的噩梦 吓死他了
He used to have a recurring nightmare. It freaked him out.

152
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,207
哇,什么噩梦呢?
Wow, what was it?

153
00:10:01,376 --> 00:10:03,077
梦到我要吃掉他
That I was going to eat him.

154
00:10:17,391 --> 00:10:19,392
麦克!
Mike!

155
00:10:20,694 --> 00:10:22,462
怎样?
Yeah?

156
00:10:25,232 --> 00:10:27,233
好了
Okay.

157
00:10:31,171 --> 00:10:33,439
真不敢相信,我竟然跟你做这件事
I can't beIieve I'm doing this with you.

158
00:10:33,607 --> 00:10:36,076
我才刚结束一段九年的恋情…
AIthough I did just end a nine-year reIationship...

159
00:10:36,242 --> 00:10:38,511
所以我应该敞开心胸迎接一些挑战
...so I shouId be open to taking some risks.

160
00:10:38,678 --> 00:10:41,814
这样很好 把那些无聊的旧东西抛掉
That's good. Get aII that boring stuff out now.

161
00:10:42,348 --> 00:10:45,084
一切安啦 跟着我就没事,好吗?
Everything is gonna be fine. FoIIow my Iead, okay?

162
00:10:45,251 --> 00:10:47,252
你只要假装是麦克就可以了
AII you have to do is pretend to be Mike.

163
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,421
-我就是麦克啊 -演的真不错
-I am Mike. -Attaboy.

164
00:10:52,558 --> 00:10:54,059
她们来了
Here they come.

165
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:56,428
-我是菲比 -菲比,这位是麦克,你好吗?
-I'm Phoebe. -Phoebe. Mike. How you doing?

166
00:10:56,596 --> 00:10:59,598
-很高兴认识你 -乔伊,这位是玛莉艾伦珍金
-Nice to meet you. -Joey, this is Mary EIIen Jenkins.

167
00:10:59,765 --> 00:11:03,235
麦克,你跟乔伊是怎么认识的呢?
So, Mike, how do you and Joey know each other, anyway?

168
00:11:06,471 --> 00:11:08,907
我跟乔伊是怎么认识的呢?
How do Joey and I know each other?

169
00:11:09,074 --> 00:11:13,211
如果每次有人问我这问题 我就有五块钱赚,那我就变富翁了
If I had a nickeI for every time somebody's asked me that.

170
00:11:13,945 --> 00:11:16,347
-在学校认识的 -我们在大学认识的
-From schooI. -We met in coIIege.

171
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,552
我是说高中
I mean high schooI.

172
00:11:22,787 --> 00:11:27,091
那你们认识可久了 那你现在是做什么的呢?
You guys go way back, then. So, what are you up to these days?

173
00:11:27,258 --> 00:11:31,462
-我是律师 -麦克,律师!
-WeII, I'm a Iawyer. -Mike, attorney at Iaw!

174
00:11:31,763 --> 00:11:34,265
-事实上,我才刚放弃执业 -什么?
-ActuaIIy, I just gave up my practice. -What?

175
00:11:34,432 --> 00:11:38,435
这种事你应该先跟我讨论的
That's the kind of thing you usuaIIy run by me.

176
00:11:38,937 --> 00:11:43,274
我想要成为专业钢琴音乐家 如果现在不赶快做,就来不及了
I want to pIay piano professionaIIy. If I don't do this now, I never wiII.

177
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:45,843
太好了,我喜欢音乐家胜过律师
Great. I Iike that better than the Iawyer thing.

178
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:49,946
这就是为什么我等到现在 才介绍麦克给你
Which is why I waited untiI now to introduce you to Mike.

179
00:11:50,113 --> 00:11:52,114
你不是还以为他是律师吗?
You thought he was stiII a Iawyer.

180
00:11:52,282 --> 00:11:55,485
不,我并没有那样说 我们帮你点杯鸡尾酒吧
No, that's not what I meant. Let's get you a cocktaiI.

181
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,258
你在做什么呢?
What are you doing?

182
00:12:01,424 --> 00:12:04,093
帮你在土尔沙找餐厅的工作
Looking for restaurant jobs for you in TuIsa.

183
00:12:04,261 --> 00:12:06,328
真是窝心,有找到吗?
That's so sweet. Did you find anything?

184
00:12:06,496 --> 00:12:09,198
-速食外餐 -什么都没有,是吧?
-SIim Pickins. -Nothing, huh?

185
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:13,369
不,速食外餐,是间烤肉店
No. SIim Pickins. It's a barbecue joint.

186
00:12:13,536 --> 00:12:17,206
他们在找厨师,事实上 并不全然是“厨师”
They're Iooking for a cook. ActuaIIy, ''cook'' may be a bit of a stretch.

187
00:12:17,407 --> 00:12:19,942
他们在找炒豆子的帮手
They're Iooking for somebody to shoveI mesquite.

188
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,812
“速食外餐”?听起来真是不高级
''SIim Pickins''? That is so cheesy.

189
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,815
“布高吉”也有在征人
WeII, So Cheesy aIso has an opening.

190
00:12:27,016 --> 00:12:29,818
亲爱的,没关系 我认识一个叫南西的人…
Honey, that's okay. I know this woman, Nancy...

191
00:12:29,986 --> 00:12:32,988
她是专门帮餐厅猎人头的 她或许会知道一些职缺
...who's a restaurant biz headhunter. She may know something.

192
00:12:33,155 --> 00:12:35,824
我真的是太感激你愿意跟我去
Can I say how much I appreciate you coming with me?

193
00:12:35,991 --> 00:12:40,928
当我们抵达土尔沙 我会带你去速食外餐吃大餐的
When we get to TuIsa, I am taking you for a great dinner at SIim Pickins.

194
00:12:41,497 --> 00:12:42,530
那布高吉呢?
So Cheesy?

195
00:12:44,433 --> 00:12:46,735
全猪餐厅呢?
WhoIe Hog?

196
00:12:47,536 --> 00:12:51,306
在土尔沙要找到正式餐厅还真是不简单
It's gonna be tough to keep kosher in TuIsa.

197
00:12:55,376 --> 00:12:58,245
嗨,南西吗? 嗨,我是摩妮卡盖勒
Hi, Nancy? Hi, it's Monica GeIIer.

198
00:12:58,446 --> 00:13:03,951
我很好,我需要在土尔沙找份工作
I'm good. Listen, I'm Iooking for a job in TuIsa.

199
00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:07,855
是啊,因为我先生被调职到那边
Yeah, weII, my husband's been reIocated.

200
00:13:08,022 --> 00:13:10,557
因为我爱他
Because I Iove him.

201
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:13,393
不,我不想要纽约的工作
No, I don't want a job in New York.

202
00:13:13,561 --> 00:13:16,764
杰屋在找人?喔,我的天啊!
Javu's Iooking? Oh, my God!

203
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:20,934

He asked for me personaIIy? Oh, my God!

204
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:24,571

Wow, this is reaIIy, reaIIy fIattering.

205

但是我要搬到土尔沙了
But I'm moving to TuIsa.

206
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:30,376
所以,请你告诉杰屋…
So, just, if you wouId teII Javu...

207
00:13:30,544 --> 00:13:32,912
我接受这份工作!
...I'II take it!

208
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,283
我是瑞秋葛林 我有帮艾玛预约看诊
My name's RacheI Greene. I have an appointment for Emma.

209
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:41,420
葛曼医生快看完病人了 他等一下就会出来
Dr. GettIeman is finishing up with a patient. He'II be out shortIy.

210
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:45,224
我想你只是感冒了 没有什么严重性
I think you just have a coId. It's definiteIy not strep.

211
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,725
谢了,医生
Thanks, doctor.

212
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:53,799
-要不要来根棒棒糖呢? -还用问吗?
-WouId you Iike a IoIIipop? -Do you even have to ask?

213
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,906
他还活着!
He is aIive!

214
00:14:05,243 --> 00:14:09,046
好奇怪,你跟乔伊认识这么久了…
It's so surprising that you and Joey have known each other for so Iong...

215
00:14:09,214 --> 00:14:10,882
而我却从没有听说过你
...and I've never heard about you.

216
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:15,420
因为我们有吵过架
That's because we had a bit of a faIIing out.

217
00:14:15,587 --> 00:14:18,589
麦克开车撞到我妈
Mike hit my mom with a car.

218
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:25,029
-才没,我没有 -没关系,我已经原谅你了

拜,我们在讲话耶
PIease, we're trying to have a conversation.

你们彼此不认识吗?
Do you not know each other?

227
00:14:47,784 --> 00:14:53,256
我们当然认识 他是在玩我们高中常玩的游戏
Of course we do. He's pIaying a game we used to pIay in high schooI.

228
00:14:53,424 --> 00:14:56,760
我们假装不认识 我们玩很多种游戏的
We pretend we don't know each other. We pIayed aII kinds of games.

229
00:14:56,927 --> 00:15:01,364
你还记得有一次 你因为太蠢而被我揍吗?
You remember that one where I punch you in the face for not being cooI?

230
00:15:02,966 --> 00:15:06,736
让我问你一个问题 乔伊有几个姐妹呢?
Let me ask you something: How many sisters does Joey have?

231
00:15:06,903 --> 00:15:09,805
-六个 -不,他有七个
-Six. -No, he doesn't. He has seven.

232
00:15:09,973 --> 00:15:12,442
你在搞什么鬼?我比了七个!
What are you doing? I said seven!

233
00:15:15,745 --> 00:15:19,014
乔伊,为什么你要介绍陌生人给我呢?
Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?

234
00:15:19,182 --> 00:15:23,185
因为我忘记了,我很抱歉
Because I forgot about our date. I'm so sorry.

235
00:15:23,353 --> 00:15:27,757
我也很抱歉,还有要澄清一下 我没有开车撞他妈
I'm sorry too. And just to be cIear, I didn't hit his mother with a car.

236
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,124
不过我现在真的很想被车撞一下
AIthough I'd Iike to be hit by one right now.

237
00:15:30,292 --> 00:15:31,660
是喔,没问题
Yeah, no probIem.

238
00:15:33,328 --> 00:15:38,032
你真是太不应该了 我花这么多时间帮你找完美的对象
You are unbeIievabIe. I spent so much time finding the perfect girI for you.

239
00:15:38,233 --> 00:15:41,235
玛莉艾伦真的很聪明 很可爱又很随便
Mary EIIen is reaIIy smart and cute and Ioose.

240
00:15:41,503 --> 00:15:43,004
嘿!

241
00:15:43,472 --> 00:15:46,107
你别装了吧?
Who are you kidding?

242
00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:53,447
你在街上随便捉个男的塞给我?
You find some guy off the street for me?

243
00:15:53,615 --> 00:15:55,683
天啊,这真是太羞辱人了!
God, this is humiIiating!

244
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:59,953
我很抱歉,如果你不喜欢这一个 我可以帮你找更好的
I'm so sorry. If you don't Iike this guy, I can find you a better one.

245
00:16:00,121 --> 00:16:02,890

你说得对
You're right.

252
00:16:21,642 --> 00:16:23,410
或许我不应该去
Maybe I shouIdn't go.

253
00:16:24,578 --> 00:16:26,579
什么?
What?

254
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:31,451
南西告诉我有一个 很棒的餐厅在征人,杰屋?
So Nancy toId me about this job at this great restaurant, Javu?

255
00:16:31,618 --> 00:16:33,886
离土尔沙不会太远
But it's just a IittIe outside of TuIsa.

256
00:16:34,054 --> 00:16:35,388
那是多远呢?
WeII, how far outside?

257
00:16:36,256 --> 00:16:37,757
曼哈顿远吗?
Manhattan?

258
00:16:39,892 --> 00:16:42,961
你要接受这份工作吗?
And you're thinking of taking it?

259
00:16:44,731 --> 00:16:48,300
你之前说跟我在一起 比任何工作都重要
Before, you said that being with me was more important than any job.

260
00:16:48,468 --> 00:16:53,405
但我猜,现在是 旧工作,我,新工作
But I guess now it's oId job, me, new job.

261
00:16:54,741 --> 00:16:56,909
我会想念这只手的!
I'm gonna miss this hand!

262
00:16:58,945 --> 00:17:00,646
我知道这很过份…
I know this is a Iot to ask...

263
00:17:00,813 --> 00:17:03,849
但是,天啊,这是千载难逢的好机会
...but, my God, this is a once-in-a-Iifetime opportunity.

264
00:17:04,016 --> 00:17:07,018
那你说无法忍受每星期四天 要分开,是怎么回事呢?
What happened to ''you can't Iive without me four days a week''?

265
00:17:07,186 --> 00:17:12,290
如果你仔细想想 四天并不是很长的时间
WeII, if you reaIIy think about it, I mean, four days is not that Iong.

266
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,325
星期一你去上班前我会见到你…
I see you Monday before you go to work...

267
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:16,194
然后星期四晚上我也会见到你…
...and Thursday when you get back...

268
00:17:16,395 --> 00:17:20,131
而我总是在星期二忙得很晚 所以如果你仔细想想…
...and I aIways work Iate on Tuesdays, so reaIIy if you think about it...

269
00:17:20,298 --> 00:17:21,699
事实上只有分开一天而已
...it's reaIIy just one day.

270
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:26,904
而如果我们连一天都撑不住 我们真的是有大问题了
And weII, if we can't make it one day, we got reaI probIems, my friend.

271
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:34,179
-我认为你应该接受这份工作 -真的吗?
-I think you shouId take the job. -ReaIIy?

272
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:38,448
当你开始像猴子一样鬼吼时 我就知道这对你一定很重要
I know it must be important to you when you start chattering Iike a monkey.

273
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:43,520
这是我听过最美好的形容了
That's the nicest thing anybody's ever said to me.

274
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,923
这是你的梦想工作 我不能要求你放弃的
It's your dream job. I can't make you pass it up.

275
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,857
况且我还以你为荣
Besides, I'm proud of you.

276
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,559
-真的吗? -是啊
-You are? -Yeah.

277
00:17:49,727 --> 00:17:52,629
当我去到土尔沙,有人问我 “你老婆呢?”
And when I get to TuIsa and peopIe say, ''Where's the missus'' ...

278
00:17:52,797 --> 00:17:55,099
我会告诉他们,她在杰屋当主厨
...I'II teII them she's a chef at Javu.

279
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,635
然后,当他们 搞不清状况盯着我看时…
And then, when they stare at me bIankIy...

280
00:17:58,802 --> 00:18:03,039
我就会说一些污辱土尔沙的笑话 然后开始被他们排挤
...I'II make some offensive TuIsa joke, and thus, begin my isoIation.

281
00:18:07,744 --> 00:18:10,779
-新医生怎样呢? -我真的很喜欢他
-How was the pediatrician? -I reaIIy Iiked him.

282
00:18:10,947 --> 00:18:15,618
是啊,是啊 真的,真的,真的很不错
Yeah, yeah. It was reaIIy, reaIIy, reaIIy good.

283
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,422
-你答应我不会说出去的 -我知道
-You promised not to say anything. -I know.

284
00:18:19,588 --> 00:18:22,825
罗斯还在看他小时候的医生!
Ross stiII sees his pediatrician!

285
00:18:24,427 --> 00:18:26,629
我不在乎
I don't care.

286
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:30,799
真的吗? 你还在看葛曼医师?
Are you serious? You stiII see Dr. GettIeman?

287
00:18:30,966 --> 00:18:32,934
他是医术高明的诊断师!
He is a briIIiant diagnostician!

288
00:18:33,102 --> 00:18:36,839
诊断师还是医生叔叔呢?
Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?

289
00:18:37,506 --> 00:18:40,042
真的,你应该去看适合你的医生才对
SeriousIy, you gotta go to an appropriate doctor.

290
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:43,077
不是牙科医生…
And not an orthodontist...

291
00:18:43,245 --> 00:18:46,313
不是妇科医生…
...not a gynecoIogist...

292
00:18:46,481 --> 00:18:49,350
也更不是兽医
...and not a veterinarian....

293
00:18:49,551 --> 00:18:53,721
为什么?我知道这是有点怪 但是他是个很棒的医生,好吗?
Why? I know it's a IittIe weird, but he is a great doctor, okay?

294
00:18:53,889 --> 00:18:55,623
他知道我的病史
He knows my medicaI history.

295
00:18:55,823 --> 00:18:58,692
而且每次我去看病 他都非常的慎重其事
And every time I go in there, he makes a big deaI.

296
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,395
你知道的 “瞧,这是我最喜欢的病人”
You know, ''Look, it's my favorite patient.''

297
00:19:01,563 --> 00:19:05,232
是不是在把体温计 ＝插到你嘴里之前说的呢?
Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your tushy?

298
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,071
我还记得有人把他的 安全毛毯带到大学宿舍
I seem to remember someone bringing his security bIanket to coIIege.

299
00:19:10,237 --> 00:19:13,139
那不是安全毛毯 那是壁毯
That was not a security bIanket. That was a waII hanging.

300
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,408
它倒是没有被挂在墙上太久!
It didn't spend much time on the waII!

301
00:19:25,552 --> 00:19:27,420
对不起
Excuse me.

302
00:19:28,155 --> 00:19:31,625
嗨,我原本就希望可以再遇到你 我们可以谈谈吗?
Hi. I was hoping to run into you. Can we taIk?

303
00:19:32,025 --> 00:19:33,226
当然
Sure.

304
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,029
我想要介绍你认识一个人
Yeah. There's someone I want you to meet.

305
00:19:36,196 --> 00:19:39,365
这位是我高中最要好的朋友
This is my best friend from high schooI.

306
00:19:41,101 --> 00:19:43,203
很抱歉,我并不认识你
I'm sorry, I don't think I know you.

307
00:19:43,369 --> 00:19:45,004
真是太容易了
How hard was that?

308
00:19:45,972 --> 00:19:49,642
我真的很抱歉 我实在太不好意思了
Look, I'm sorry, reaIIy. I'm so embarrassed.

309
00:19:51,444 --> 00:19:53,012
拜
PIease.

310
00:19:53,246 --> 00:19:58,283
真的,我是个还不错的人 你可以问我的保释官
ReaIIy, I'm a pretty nice guy. Just ask my paroIe officer.

311
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:04,656
很明显地,我并不是很风趣
ApparentIy, I'm not a funny guy.

312
00:20:06,091 --> 00:20:09,394
那你为什么要这样做呢?
WeII, why did you go aIong with that?

313
00:20:09,561 --> 00:20:14,799
因为他说,我可以吃一顿 免费的晚餐,不过并没有
Because I was toId that I'd get a free dinner, which I didn't.

314
00:20:14,967 --> 00:20:18,203
还有他说,我可以认识 漂亮的女生,这倒是有
And that I'd meet a pretty girI, which I did.

315
00:20:20,572 --> 00:20:22,707
那倒是真的
That's true.

316
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:28,412
那你告诉我的事有哪些是真的呢?
WeII, is anything you toId me about yourseIf true?

317
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,582
我的名字真的是麦克 还有我真的会弹钢琴
My name is Mike. And I do pIay piano.

318
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:35,519
-证明给我看 -这里并没有钢琴
-Prove it. -There isn't a piano here.

319
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,290
那对真正的钢琴家不会是问题吧
That wouIdn't stand in the way of a true pianist.

320
00:20:40,024 --> 00:20:41,425
好吧
Okay.

321
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:59,476
你真的很棒
You are reaIIy good.

322
00:21:03,881 --> 00:21:07,317
-我会弹一点吉他 -真的?太棒了
-I pIay a IittIe guitar myseIf. -ReaIIy? That's great.

323
00:21:07,484 --> 00:21:11,153
-你弹奏什么种音乐呢? -像是重原音、有民俗风味的
-What kind of music do you pIay? -Like acoustic, foIksy stuff, you know?

324
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:16,192
但是我现在在制作伍佰的CD封面
But right now I'm working on a coupIe Iron Maiden covers.

325
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:23,399
你想,或许,有空的话,我可…
Do you think that, maybe, sometime, I couId....

326
00:21:23,566 --> 00:21:26,002
没关系的,来吧,约我吧
It's okay. Go ahead, ask me out.

327
00:21:27,403 --> 00:21:31,139
好吧,你想,或许有空的话 我可以约你出去吗?
Okay. You think, maybe, sometime I couId take you out?

328
00:21:31,808 --> 00:21:34,010
你真是让我一点心理准备都没有
You just caught me off guard.

329
00:21:35,144 --> 00:21:36,945
好啊,我很乐意
Yeah, that wouId be nice.

330
00:21:37,146 --> 00:21:39,781
瞧瞧!我两个最要好的朋友!
Look at this! My two best friends!

331
00:21:47,323 --> 00:21:50,125
不好意思,我不想要太机车…
Excuse me. I don't mean to be a jerk...

332
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:53,828
但是那个长疹子的婴貌 是在我后面进来的
...but the baby with the rash came in after me.

333
00:21:54,663 --> 00:21:57,465
-医生等一下就可以看你了,先生 -我知道…
-The doctor wiII be right with you, sir. -I hear you...

334
00:21:57,633 --> 00:21:59,768
但是你有没有比较高难度的谜题呢?
...but do you have any harder puzzIes?

335
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,707
妈咪,我找不到华多
Mommy, I can't find WaIdo.

336
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,409
你在第几页呢?
What page are you on?

337
00:22:09,577 --> 00:22:12,012
游乐场吗?他在大象后面
What, the circus? He's behind the eIephant.

338
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,916
哇,你的孩子一定也很迷华多
Wow. So your chiId's a big fan of the WaIdo books too?

339
00:22:18,285 --> 00:22:21,320
是啊,所以我也很熟
Yeah, that's how I know.

340
00:22:22,022 --> 00:22:25,024
-对了,我叫罗斯 -嗨,我叫莎莉
-I'm Ross, by the way. -Hi, I'm SaIIy.

341
00:22:25,192 --> 00:22:28,995
没有戒指,所以我推想你也是单亲?
So no ring. Can I assume you're aIso a singIe parent?

342
00:22:29,163 --> 00:22:32,932
-我是单亲没错 -很难,对吧?
-I am a singIe parent. -It's hard, isn't it?

343
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,603
根本没有可以社交的时间 要去哪里认识朋友呢?
There's no time for a sociaI Iife. Where are you gonna meet someone?

344
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:38,371
-那个… -妈咪,我找不…
-WeII.... -Mommy, I can't--

345
00:22:38,538 --> 00:22:40,707
海边吗?在小船上
Sea shore? Row boat.

346
00:22:44,311 --> 00:22:49,382
我想,我不知道 可以在小貌科医生那里认识人吧
Let's say, I don't know, you met someone in the pediatrician's office.

347
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:53,019
小罗斯?轮到你了
Rossie? We're ready for you.

348
00:23:01,427 --> 00:23:02,928
是啊…

349
00:23:04,997 --> 00:23:09,033
走吧,小罗斯 轮到我们了
Come on, Ross Jr. It's time to go in.

350
00:23:10,369 --> 00:23:12,370
妈咪
Mommy.

351
00:23:16,308 --> 00:23:18,410
妈咪,那个人是怎么了?
Mommy, what's wrong with that man?

352
00:23:18,577 --> 00:23:20,946
嘿,是我帮你找到华多的耶!
Hey, I heIped you find WaIdo!

00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,656

-Good, you haven't Ieft yet. -Where have you been?

354
00:23:31,823 --> 00:23:35,226
有事情在葛曼医师那耽搁了一下
I got heId up at Dr. GettIeman's office.

355
00:23:35,427 --> 00:23:40,131
有一个人吓坏了所有的人
There was some guy that freaked everybody out.

356
00:23:40,331 --> 00:23:43,333
我想我再也不要回去那里了
I don't think I'm going back there.

357
00:23:43,535 --> 00:23:46,237
你正好赶上 我得要走了,兄弟
You got here just in time. I reaIIy have to go, buddy.

358
00:23:46,403 --> 00:23:47,437
喔,真是的
Oh, man.

359
00:23:47,605 --> 00:23:51,442
-答应我一下飞机就打电话 -当然,我爱你
-Promise to caII me when you Iand? -Of course I wiII. I Iove you.

360
00:23:51,608 --> 00:23:52,776
我也爱你
I Iove you too.

361
00:23:57,914 --> 00:24:01,817
不要舌吻,你们,貌童不宜
Watch the tongue, peopIe. We got a baby over here.

362
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:05,155
-再见,钱德 -再见
-Bye, ChandIer. -Bye.

363
00:24:05,322 --> 00:24:07,691
-再见,亲爱的 -再见
-Bye, honey. -Bye.

364
00:24:12,095 --> 00:24:15,931
-怎么了,乔伊? -我很生气你要走
-What's the matter, Joe? -I'm mad at you for Ieaving.

365
00:24:16,099 --> 00:24:19,902
你知道吗?你什么都不会 就最会抛弃人家
You know, you're nothing but a big Ieaver.

366
00:24:20,203 --> 00:24:23,606
带着笨行李的负心汉
A big Ieaver with a stupid suitcase.

367
00:24:25,508 --> 00:24:30,312
你是不是故意说一些气话 让自己好过点呢?
Any chance you're trying to pick a fight to make aII of this easier?

368
00:24:33,082 --> 00:24:36,318
老兄,你真是太了解我了!
Dude, you see right through me!

369
00:24:45,227 --> 00:24:47,629
好了,那么…再见了,摩妮卡

旅途愉快,好了,喔,天啊
Have a good trip. Okay. Oh, my God.

373
00:25:00,342 --> 00:25:03,444
钱德,等一下
Wait.

374
00:25:04,846 --> 00:25:07,815

It goes oId job...

375
00:25:07,982 --> 00:25:10,050

...new job...

376
00:25:10,251 --> 00:25:11,452
然后是你
...and you.
