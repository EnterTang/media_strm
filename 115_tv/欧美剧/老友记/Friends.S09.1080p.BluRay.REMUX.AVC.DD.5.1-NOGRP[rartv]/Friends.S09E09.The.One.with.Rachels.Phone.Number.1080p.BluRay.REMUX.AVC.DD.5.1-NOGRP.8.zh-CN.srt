1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,737
这只小猫叫手套 这只是费修
This kitty is Mittens. This one is Fitzhugh.

2
00:00:06,904 --> 00:00:09,807
然后这住在猫公寓的小男生是金吉
And this IittIe guy in the cat condo is Jinkies.

3
00:00:12,411 --> 00:00:15,314
好多猫喔,裘琳
That's a Iot of cats, Jo Lynn.

4
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:16,616
你是单身吧?
SingIe, are you?

5
00:00:24,093 --> 00:00:25,961
-我来接 -好啊!
-I'II get it. -Okay.

6
00:00:26,229 --> 00:00:27,263
钱德宾
ChandIer Bing.

7
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:31,067
为什么你是自己接电话呢? 你的疯狂助理去哪了?
How come you're answering your own phone? Where's your crazy assistant?

8
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,572
你没有疯,你没有疯
You're not crazy. You're not crazy.

9
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,576
否则你怎么会养那么多只猫呢?
Otherwise, why wouId you have aII those cats?

10
00:00:38,612 --> 00:00:39,646
什么事,乔伊?
What's up, Joe?

11
00:00:39,846 --> 00:00:41,981
有什么事是我们一直想要一起做的?
What have we aIways wanted to do together?

12
00:00:42,783 --> 00:00:45,820
帮彼此编辫子然后在海边骑马吗?
Braid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach?

13
00:00:45,987 --> 00:00:48,390
不不不,你明晚回家时…
No. No. No. When you get home tomorrow night...

14
00:00:48,591 --> 00:00:51,962
你跟我要去看巫师队对尼克队球赛 场边座位!
...you and I are gonna be at the Wizards-Knicks game, courtside!

15
00:00:52,162 --> 00:00:53,630
-场边座位?喔!我的天啊! -是啊!
-Courtside? Oh, my God! -Yeah!

16
00:00:53,831 --> 00:00:57,635
或许麦可乔登会扑过来抢球 然后用他的膝盖撞断我的下巴!
Maybe MichaeI Jordan wiII dive for the baII and break my jaw with his knee!

17
00:00:57,869 --> 00:01:00,138
真是太酷了,我来告诉摩妮卡
That is so cooI. I'II Iet Monica know.

18
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:04,978
这些需要你的签名
These need your signature.

19
00:01:05,146 --> 00:01:08,316
听着,裘琳,那是我朋友乔伊 他总是叫每个人疯狂的
Listen, Jo Lynn, that was my friend Joey. He caIIs everybody crazy.

20
00:01:08,483 --> 00:01:10,052
哈？ 嘿，亲爱的,是我
-Hello? -Hey, hon, it's me.

21
00:01:10,218 --> 00:01:13,756
嘿,那个疯狂猫女人还好吗?
Hi. How's the crazy cat lady?

22
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:17,027
乔伊刚打电话来…
Joey just caIIed.

23
00:01:17,194 --> 00:01:19,964
他帮我买到了明晚 尼克队比赛的场边座位
He's got courtside Knicks tickets for him and me tomorrow night.

24
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:23,502
但是明晚是我唯一不用上班的晚上
But tomorrow night's the onIy night I get off from the restaurant.

25
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,273
如果你去看球赛 我们会有一星期没有办法在一起
If you go, we won't have a night together for a week.

26
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:30,678
但是亲爱的,那是场边座位! 啦啦队会就在正前…
But honey, it's courtside! The cheerIeaders wiII be right in--

27
00:01:31,312 --> 00:01:33,748
这不是说服你的好方式
That's not the way to convince you.

28
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:36,085
我不想要成为那种老婆 老是说:
I don't wanna be one of those wives that says:

29
00:01:36,252 --> 00:01:39,155
“你不能去看球赛,你要陪我”
''You can't go to the game. You have to spend time with me.''

30
00:01:39,323 --> 00:01:41,693
所以如果你自己能够有认知…
So if you couId just reaIize it on your own....

31
00:01:42,794 --> 00:01:45,931
我知道,你说的对 我也想要见到你
I know. You're right. I wanna see you too.

32
00:01:46,098 --> 00:01:49,268
我得要想想要怎么告诉乔伊 他是满心期待着
I gotta figure out a way to teII Joey. He's Iooking forward to it.

33
00:01:49,436 --> 00:01:51,939
告诉他你很久没有见到老婆了
Tell him you haven't seen your wife in a long time.

34
00:01:52,139 --> 00:01:55,976
告诉他长距离关系是很难维系的
TeII him that having a Iong-distance reIationship is reaIIy difficuIt.

35
00:01:56,144 --> 00:02:00,282
告诉他我们这些 有限的相处时间是很宝贵的
TeII him that what IittIe time we have together is precious.

36
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:03,119
我会想想别的
I'II think of something.

37
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,859

00:02:58,758 --> 00:03:01,328
你看起来…

39
00:03:02,462 --> 00:03:06,667

WeII, I hope the ends of these sentences are good.

41
00:03:09,972 --> 00:03:13,176
是好的,只是我很久没有 看到你这样打扮
They're good. It's just been a whiIe since I've seen you Iike this.

42
00:03:13,343 --> 00:03:15,345
你产后回复的真好

60
00:03:58,334 --> 00:04:00,170
这不是约会
It's not a date.

61
00:04:00,337 --> 00:04:02,573
但是如果发展成更进一步的关系…
But if it turns out to be something more...

62
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,642
我会在门把上绑带子

这些装饰条板都是原来就有的
The moIdings are aII originaI.

89
00:06:05,297 --> 00:06:09,336
我不知道我公寓的装饰条板 是不是原创的?
I don't know if the moIdings are originaI in my apartment.

90
00:06:19,415 --> 00:06:21,885
-你是古生物学家,是吗? -是啊
-So you're a paIeontoIogist, right? -Yeah.

91
00:06:22,053 --> 00:06:24,055

Yeah. What do you think?

95
00:06:42,912 --> 00:06:44,914
嗯,看起来很棒,只不过…
WeII, it Iooks great. It's just--

96
00:06:45,082 --> 00:06:48,352
我里面穿的也跟你一样,所以…
I'm wearing the same thing underneath, so....

97
00:06:48,753 --> 00:06:51,055
你知道我的意思吗?
You see what I mean?

98
00:06:52,191 --> 00:06:55,661
嘿!为什么你的门是锁着的?
Hey! How come your door's Iocked?

99
00:06:55,829 --> 00:06:57,798
-等一下! -不不不!

00:06:57,965 --> 00:06:59,634
-乔伊不能看到我在这里 -为什么不能?
-Joey can't know I'm here. -Why not?

101
00:06:59,801 --> 00:07:02,204
我不知道怎么告诉他 我不能去看球赛…
I didn't want to say I couIdn't go to the game...

102
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:05,608
-所以我跟他说我得要留在土尔沙 -所以你跟他说谎?
-...so I toId him I had to stay in TuIsa. -So you Iied to him?

103
00:07:05,809 --> 00:07:09,613
说谎比费口舌解释要好太多了
It's aIways better to Iie than to have the compIicated discussion.

104
00:07:11,282 --> 00:07:12,951
除了跟你之外
Except with you.

105
00:07:14,353 --> 00:07:17,957
嘿,开门!是怎么回事?
Hey, open the door! What's going on?

106
00:07:21,595 --> 00:07:23,063
-你是在干么? -嗨
-What are you--? -Hi.

107
00:07:23,231 --> 00:07:25,867
你为什么穿成这样呢?
Why are you dressed Iike that?

108
00:07:26,701 --> 00:07:29,571
因为钱德几天以后就要回来了…
Because ChandIer's gonna be home in a coupIe of days...

109
00:07:29,739 --> 00:07:33,609
所以我想说可以 先练习一下妩媚的技巧
...so I thought I wouId just, you know, practice the art of seduction.

110
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,913
我刚刚好像有听到男人的声音
I thought I heard a man's voice before.

111
00:07:36,114 --> 00:07:38,851
没有,我只是在扮演钱德说话
No, I was just doing ChandIer's side of the conversation.

112
00:07:39,017 --> 00:07:41,353
你知道的,就像是: “嗨,我看起来如何?”
You know, Iike, ''Hi, how do I Iook?''

113
00:07:41,521 --> 00:07:45,826
“真性感,我还能比现在更兴奋吗?” 你知道的
''ReaIIy sexy. CouId I be any more turned on?'' You know?

114
00:07:46,394 --> 00:07:48,096
好的,等一下
Okay. Wait a minute.

115
00:07:48,263 --> 00:07:50,231
为什么有两杯酒呢?
Why are there two gIasses of wine out?

116
00:07:50,766 --> 00:07:52,768
因为一杯是要给你的
Because one of them is for you!

117
00:07:57,275 --> 00:08:00,178
干杯!好了,再见
Cheers! Okay, bye-bye.

118
00:08:01,847 --> 00:08:06,653
真好玩,我自己也一直 在练习勾引的技巧
You know, it's funny. I've been practicing the art of seduction myseIf.

119
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:11,458
-你最好在继续加强练习 -是喔!
-You might wanna keep practicing. -Yeah.

120
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:16,399
-是乔伊 -什么?
-It's Joey. -What?

121
00:08:16,565 --> 00:08:19,568
-嘿,乔伊 -老兄,回家!
-Hey, Joe. -Dude, come home!

122
00:08:21,171 --> 00:08:24,809
-什么?为什么? -回家!
-What? Why? -Come home!

123
00:08:25,043 --> 00:08:26,878
听着,我不行,是怎么回事呢?
Look, I can't. What's going on?

124
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:30,883
我不知道要怎么开口 但是我想摩妮卡背着你劈腿!
I don't know how to teII you this, but I think Monica's cheating on you!

125
00:08:31,051 --> 00:08:33,987
早就告诉过你,你不应该娶一个 比你辣那么多的人!
I toId you, you shouIdn't have married someone hotter than you!

126
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:39,561
如果你没有办法回来处理这种事 那我去处理
If you can't deaI with this, then I'm gonna.

127
00:08:39,762 --> 00:08:42,097
-不! -我听到他的声音了!
-No! -I just heard him!

128
00:08:43,467 --> 00:08:46,003
你现在有听到他的声音吗?
Can you hear him now?

129
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,575
没有,好了,我要进去了
No. AII right, I'm going in.

130
00:08:50,776 --> 00:08:52,345
-不,等等! -我又听到他了!
-No, wait! -I heard him again!

131
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:58,118
好了,你就待在那里别动 我要回家了
AII right, just stay there. I'm coming home.

132
00:08:58,319 --> 00:08:59,820
等你回来的时候见
I'II see you when you get here.

133
00:08:59,988 --> 00:09:02,257
我会在门外守着以免他走了
I'II wait out in the haII in case he comes out.

134
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,928
-有那个必要吗? -当然,你也会为我这样做的
-Is that reaIIy necessary? -AbsoIuteIy. You'd do it for me.

135
00:09:06,096 --> 00:09:10,734
不是说你会有机会那样做 因为我知道要如何满足我的女人
Not that you ever have to, because I know how to keep my women satisfied.

136
00:09:12,471 --> 00:09:14,739
-是啊,听着,万分感谢 -好了,再见
-Yeah, Iisten, thanks a Iot. -Okay, bye.

137
00:09:15,475 --> 00:09:17,477
他认为我是淫荡的女人
He thinks I'm a sIut.

138
00:09:17,644 --> 00:09:20,848
喔,对了 你不是应该当义勇消防队员的吗?
Oh, right, and you're supposed to be a fireman?

139
00:09:32,931 --> 00:09:35,266
披萨不是早就该到了吗?
ShouIdn't the pizza be here by now?

140
00:09:35,434 --> 00:09:41,074
我是说,他们说不用三十分钟就会到 已经多久了呢?
I mean, they said 30 minutes or Iess. WeII, how Iong has it been?

141
00:09:42,242 --> 00:09:44,612
十一分钟
EIeven minutes.

142
00:09:50,653 --> 00:09:53,156
现在是十二分钟
And now 1 2.

143
00:09:56,494 --> 00:10:00,198
-那你想看电视吗? -你以为我没有想过吗?
-So you wanna watch TV? -You think I haven't thought of that?

144
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,837
我也想啊,但是第四台断了
I mean, I wouId Iike to but the cabIe's out.

145
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:08,443
本来不觉得有什么大不了的,直到今晚
Didn't seem Iike such a big deaI untiI tonight.

146
00:10:13,683 --> 00:10:17,721
-你喜欢这啤酒吗? -是的,我喜欢
-So you Iike the beer? -I do. I do.

147
00:10:17,888 --> 00:10:21,659
不过,这事实上是淡啤酒
AIthough, it's actuaIIy a Iager.

148
00:10:24,697 --> 00:10:26,799
那啤酒跟淡啤酒有什么不同呢?
What's the difference between beer and Iager?

149
00:10:27,033 --> 00:10:29,570
我不知道
I don't know.

150
00:10:31,238 --> 00:10:32,473
我们可以查一查
We couId Iook it up.

151
00:10:34,376 --> 00:10:37,713
真是越来越有趣了
Things are about to get wiId.

152
00:10:43,121 --> 00:10:45,657
喔,天啊 还记得以前的女生之夜我们…
Oh, God, remember the girIs' nights we used to have...

153
00:10:45,824 --> 00:10:47,959
坐在一起讨论你跟罗斯的事吗?
...sitting around taIking about you and Ross?

154
00:10:48,127 --> 00:10:50,563
喔!天啊!感觉好像是上辈子的事
Oh, God! It seems Iike forever ago.

155
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:51,764
我知道
I know.

156
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:55,569
那,你跟罗斯是怎样了呢?
So, what's going on with you and Ross?

157
00:10:56,338 --> 00:11:01,411
喔,我不知道,我是说 已经很久没有怎样了
WeII, I don't know. I mean, for a Iong time, nothing.

158
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:05,348
但是,事实上 就在你来接我之前…
But you know, actuaIIy, right before you picked me up...

159
00:11:05,516 --> 00:11:08,085
罗斯跟我有个小小的“＝插曲”
...Ross and I had a IittIe thing.

160
00:11:08,286 --> 00:11:11,256
喔!我的天!我最爱小＝插曲! 发生什么事?
Oh, my God! I Iove things! What happened?

161
00:11:11,457 --> 00:11:14,761
嗯,他先是告诉我 他喜欢我看起来的样子
WeII, first he toId me he Iiked how I Iooked.

162
00:11:14,928 --> 00:11:18,798
然后我们做了个小小的…
And then we had a IittIe...

163
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,170
眼神交换
...eye contact.

164
00:11:23,606 --> 00:11:24,807
眼神交换?
Eye contact?

165
00:11:25,007 --> 00:11:26,776
我希望你们有用避孕措施
I hope you were using protection.

166
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:34,453
不好意思 这些是吧最后那两位先生请的
Excuse me, these are from the two gentIemen at the end of the bar.

167
00:11:35,788 --> 00:11:39,259
喔,事实上 因为喂母乳的关系我不能多喝一杯
Oh, actuaIIy, I can't have another one on account of my breast miIk.

168
00:11:40,728 --> 00:11:41,929
好的
Okay.

169
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:46,869
嘿,瑞秋,有没有比较不恶心的理由 可以让你不喝酒的
Hey, Rach, maybe there's a Iess disgusting way to decIine a drink.

170
00:11:48,905 --> 00:11:52,509
我们应该回请他们什么吗? 我们请他们吃马铃薯泥好了!
ShouId we send them something back? Let's send them mashed potatoes!

171
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,044
不,等等!别那么做!
No, wait! Don't do that!

172
00:11:54,212 --> 00:11:56,214
那样他们就会认为他们可以过来
That'II make them think they can come over.

173
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:57,716
所以呢?过来又如何呢?
So, what if they do?

174
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:03,356
我们不是来这里钓男人的 你有男友,我有小孩还有罗斯
We're not here to meet guys. You have a boyfriend. I have a baby and a Ross.

175
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:08,097
是啊,但这只是好玩 又不会发生什么事
Yeah, but nothing has to happen. We're just having fun.

176
00:12:08,263 --> 00:12:12,335
你知道的 不是每件事都得发展到眼神交换地步的
You know, not everything has to go as far as eye contact.

177
00:12:14,338 --> 00:12:16,974
钱德,你得要告诉乔伊你不在土尔沙
ChandIer, you have to teII Joey you're not in TuIsa.

178
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,911
让他认为是你在欺骗我…
Isn't it better for him to think you're cheating on me...

179
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:22,915
总比他认为我在欺骗他好吧?
...than for him to think I'm cheating on him?

180
00:12:23,116 --> 00:12:24,918
我自己听到了
I heard it.

181
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:27,888
我不想让他误会我有外遇
I don't want him to think I'm having an affair.

182
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:31,359
好了,我有个计画 我会从防火梯爬下去…
AII right, I've got a pIan. I'II go down the fire escape--

183
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,731
所有完美的计画都是从 “我会从防火梯爬下去”开始的
Because aII good pIans start with, ''I'II go down the fire escape.''

184
00:12:34,931 --> 00:12:36,298
听我说完,女人!
Hear me out, woman!

185
00:12:38,101 --> 00:12:40,170
我会从防火梯爬下去然后等着
I'II go down the fire escape and wait.

186
00:12:40,404 --> 00:12:42,907
然后就会像是我刚从土尔沙回来一样…
Then it'II be Iike I just got back from TuIsa.

187
00:12:43,075 --> 00:12:46,078
然后乔伊跟我进来 看到这里根本没有男人
Joey and I wiII come in and see that there's no guy in here.

188
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:49,683
你难道不怕乔伊会识破吗?
Aren't you afraid that Joey's gonna figure aII this out?

189
00:12:52,954 --> 00:12:54,488
我自己听到了
I heard it.

190
00:13:02,332 --> 00:13:04,401
-我要等一下 -可怕的鸽子又回来了吗?
-I'm gonna wait. -The scary pigeon's back?

191
00:13:04,602 --> 00:13:06,671
超大的
It's huge.

192
00:13:40,048 --> 00:13:43,919
我不敢相信你住在那栋公寓 我奶奶也住在那栋公寓!
I can't beIieve you Iive in that buiIding. My grandmother Iives in that buiIding!

193
00:13:44,086 --> 00:13:46,523
艾达葛林,没有个人空间感…
Ida Greene? No sense of personaI space...

194
00:13:46,689 --> 00:13:49,192
闻起来像鸡,看起来像马铃薯
...kind of smeIIs Iike chicken, Iooks Iike a potato.

195
00:13:49,393 --> 00:13:52,096
-“洋芋”是你奶奶? -那就是我“啊嬷”!
-''Spuds'' is your grandmother? -That's my bubbe!

196
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,370
我们要再去几个派对
So we're on our way to a coupIe of parties.

197
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:01,842
或许我们可以跟你们要号码 如果遇到好玩的,打电话给你们
Maybe we couId get your numbers and caII if we find something fun?

198
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:05,881
我很抱歉,我们并没有在找什么对象
Yeah. I'm sorry, we weren't reaIIy Iooking for anything to happen...

199
00:14:06,048 --> 00:14:08,584
我有男朋友了
...with you guys. I have a boyfriend.

200
00:14:08,885 --> 00:14:10,920
-好的 -没关系
-AII right. -It's no big deaI.

201
00:14:11,288 --> 00:14:14,224
只是好奇,你们哪一个喜欢我呢?
Just out of curiosity, which one of you was for me?

202
00:14:15,994 --> 00:14:18,897
-是我 -很好
-That wouId've been me. -Nice.

203
00:14:20,667 --> 00:14:23,904
如果情况不同,小子 你可是会有得忙的
Different situation, cowboy, and you wouId've had yourseIf a handfuI.

204
00:14:27,642 --> 00:14:32,147
所以她有男朋友 那你的情形是怎样呢?
So she has a boyfriend. What is your situation?

205
00:14:32,582 --> 00:14:36,119
嗯,这有点复杂 我并没有男朋友,但是…
WeII, it's compIicated. I don't actuaIIy have a boyfriend, but--

206
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,823
那我可以跟你要电话号码吗?
Then can I have your number?

207
00:14:39,457 --> 00:14:41,159
我很抱歉,不行
I'm sorry, no.

208
00:14:41,627 --> 00:14:42,728
好的
Okay.

209
00:14:43,229 --> 00:14:45,498
喔,当然可以!
Oh, sure!

210
00:14:46,934 --> 00:14:50,171
喔!天啊,你给他的电话是真的!
Oh, my God, you're giving your reaI number!

211
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,310
好的,谢谢,我今晚会打给你
Okay, thanks. I'II give you a caII Iater tonight.

212
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,378
-太好了 -再见
-Great. -Bye.

213
00:14:56,546 --> 00:14:57,814
再见
Bye.

214
00:14:59,783 --> 00:15:01,485
那真的太棒了
So that's great.

215
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:05,356
你、比尔、罗斯、还有艾玛 会很快乐在一起
You, BiII, Ross and Emma are gonna be so happy together.

216
00:15:05,524 --> 00:15:06,958
你是在想什么呢?
What were you thinking?

217
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,564
我不知道,他很可爱然后又喜欢我 我冲动之下就给他了
I don't know. He was cute, and he Iiked me. It was an impuIse.

218
00:15:11,065 --> 00:15:14,836
就像我买这双鞋的时候 它们很可爱而且也喜欢我
Like when I bought these shoes. They were cute and they Iiked me too.

219
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,605
那罗斯怎么办吗?你们的小＝插曲呢?
But what about Ross? What about your moment?

220
00:15:18,707 --> 00:15:20,676
我们是有过小＝插曲 我们对看了彼此
We had a moment. We Iooked at each other.

221
00:15:20,844 --> 00:15:24,949
或许如果我们一起住了十年 我们可能就会牵手了!
Maybe if we Iive together for another 1 0 years, we may hoId hands!

222
00:15:25,783 --> 00:15:27,852
但是你原本对这件事 是非常高兴的
But you were reaIIy excited about it.

223
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:30,055
-你不想要跟他谈吗? -不想
-Don't you wanna taIk to him? -No.

224
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:33,360
不想,因为我完全知道 谈话的结果会是怎样
No, because I know exactIy how the conversation's gonna go.

225
00:15:33,526 --> 00:15:36,563
“嘿!罗斯,我认为我们 刚刚有个小＝插曲”
''Hey, Ross, you know, I think we had a moment before.''

226
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:40,034
“是啊,我也这么认为”
''Yeah. Me too.''

227
00:15:40,202 --> 00:15:43,573
“嗯,但是我不太确定 我是不是想再更进一步”
''WeII, but I'm not sure I reaIIy want to do anything about it.''

228
00:15:43,739 --> 00:15:46,910
“是啊,我也不确定”
''Yeah. Me neither.''

229
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:48,746
我们是不是就住在一起…
''ShouId we just Iive together...

230
00:15:48,913 --> 00:15:51,082
然后不要告诉彼此 我们互相的感受?
...and not teII each other how we're feeIing?''

231
00:15:51,249 --> 00:15:54,186
“是啊,我没意见”
''Yeah, that works for me.''

232
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:57,857
是啊,我知道你的意思
Yeah, I see what you mean.

233
00:15:58,025 --> 00:16:01,296
对了,你模仿的罗斯真像
By the way, nice Ross imitation.

234
00:16:01,462 --> 00:16:03,031
你模仿的瑞秋 不够爱发牢骚
Your RacheI wasn't whiny enough.

235
00:16:03,231 --> 00:16:04,699
-嗯…嘿! -好多了
-WeII-- Hey! -Better.

236
00:16:07,304 --> 00:16:11,309
重点是我或许应该停止等待 跟罗斯之间的小＝插曲
The point is maybe I shouId just stop waiting around for moments with Ross.

237
00:16:11,475 --> 00:16:14,679
你知道吗?我应该要过我自己的生活了
You know? I shouId just move on with my Iife.

238
00:16:14,913 --> 00:16:17,782
真的,你要放弃罗斯了?
So reaIIy, you're moving on from Ross?

239
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:20,285
我不知道,我得要现在做决定吗?
I don't know. Do I have to decide right now?

240
00:16:20,454 --> 00:16:23,424
你好像已经做了 那男的今晚会打电话给你
You kind of just did. That guy is gonna caII you tonight.

241
00:16:23,591 --> 00:16:26,594
罗斯会接起电话,这是挺明白的讯息了
Ross wiII pick up the phone, and that's a pretty cIear message.

242
00:16:26,795 --> 00:16:28,497
喔!天啊,罗斯!
Oh, my God, Ross!

243
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:30,799
罗斯会接起电话
Ross is gonna pick up the phone.

244
00:16:30,967 --> 00:16:34,003
我得拿回我的电话号码 喔!天啊,他走了!
I have to get my number back. Oh, my God, he's gone!

245
00:16:34,238 --> 00:16:37,742
“我得拿回我的电话号码 喔!天啊,他走了!”模仿的真棒
''Oh, I have to get my number back! Oh, my God! He's gone!'' Dead on.

246
00:16:51,661 --> 00:16:55,031
-我想我该走了 -这么快吗?
-You know, I'm gonna take off. -So soon?

247
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:56,566
-是啊 -好的
-Yeah. -Okay.

248
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:59,270
嗯,谢谢你带啤酒过来
WeII, thanks-- Thanks for the beer.

249
00:16:59,437 --> 00:17:03,108
-你是说淡啤酒吧? -是啊,快乐时光
-You mean Iager? -Yeah. Good times.

250
00:17:07,982 --> 00:17:10,651
-好的 -好了
-Okay. -AII right.

251
00:17:24,603 --> 00:17:26,838
-哈? -嘿,麦克,是我
-HeIIo? -Hey, Mike, it's me.

252
00:17:27,006 --> 00:17:28,941
听着,罗斯在你旁边吗?
Listen, is-- Is Ross near you?

253
00:17:29,142 --> 00:17:30,676
没有,我才刚走
No, I just Ieft.

254
00:17:31,144 --> 00:17:34,915
而现在,是我今晚 有过最有趣的对话了
And that, right there, is the most interesting conversation I've had aII night.

255
00:17:35,984 --> 00:17:37,119
真的吗?好的
ReaIIy? Okay.

256
00:17:37,285 --> 00:17:39,054
嗯,你得要再回去
WeII, you have to go back in.

257
00:17:39,855 --> 00:17:44,460
什么?回去?回到时光暂停之地吗?
What? Go back? To the Iand where time stands stiII?

258
00:17:45,195 --> 00:17:46,797
我很抱歉,亲爱的,但是…
I'm so sorry, honey, but--

259
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,967
瑞秋给了一个男的她的电话…
Okay, RacheI gave this guy her number...

260
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:51,469
她不希望罗斯去接电话
...and she doesn't want Ross to answer the phone.

261
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:53,673
所以你必须要拦截他所有的电话
So you have to intercept aII his caIIs.

262
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:55,375
我不能这样做!
I can't do that!

263
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:58,579
-他说他不能那样做 -电话给我
-He says he can't do that. -Give me the phone.

264
00:17:58,747 --> 00:18:02,417
麦克,听着,我知道这个要求很过分 但是你知道吗?
Hi, Mike. Hi, Iisten, I know that this is a Iot to ask, but you know what?

265
00:18:02,585 --> 00:18:07,958
如果你照做 菲比会做一切你想要她做的事
If you do this, Phoebe wiII do anything you want.

266
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:12,330
-真的,我说得是很肮脏的事 -好了,谢谢,哈?
-SeriousIy, I'm taIking dirty stuff. -AII right. Thank you. HeIIo?

267
00:18:12,497 --> 00:18:16,402
嗨,我替她道歉,但事实上 关于肮脏的事,她说的没错
Hi, I'm sorry about her. But actuaIIy, she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff.

268
00:18:18,438 --> 00:18:19,973
好了,我照做
AII right, I'II do it.

269
00:18:20,941 --> 00:18:24,846
但说真的,会有多肮脏呢?
But reaIIy, how much dirtier can it get?

270
00:18:26,148 --> 00:18:28,585
喔,麦克
Oh, Mike.

271
00:18:29,219 --> 00:18:31,488
拜拜
Bye.

272
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,262
嘿,老兄
Hey, buddy.

273
00:18:39,832 --> 00:18:41,366
嗨
Hi.

274
00:18:41,735 --> 00:18:44,538
-我可以回来吗? -为什么?
-Can I come back in? -Why?

275
00:18:45,973 --> 00:18:51,614
嗯,我只是在想我们 还有很多东西可以聊
WeII, I was just thinking about how much more we have to taIk about.

276
00:18:52,148 --> 00:18:55,151
但是你走了
But you Ieft.

277
00:18:59,658 --> 00:19:01,293
那倒是挺快的
That didn't take Iong.

278
00:19:01,493 --> 00:19:05,064
我以为你说土尔沙到这里要飞三小时
I thought you said TuIsa was, Iike, a three-hour fIight?

279
00:19:05,899 --> 00:19:09,637
嗯,你忘了把时差算进去了
WeII, you're forgetting about the time difference.

280
00:19:18,014 --> 00:19:20,651
-你准备好了吗?我跟你一起进去 -谢谢
-You ready? I'm gonna go in there with you. -Thanks.

281
00:19:20,818 --> 00:19:23,321
以防里面不只有一个男的
Just in case there's more than one dude in there.

282
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,424
-再一次谢谢你 -是啊
-Again, thanks. -Yeah.

283
00:19:28,462 --> 00:19:29,829
钱德,你回来了!
ChandIer, you're home!

284
00:19:29,997 --> 00:19:34,635
没错!你老公回来了! 所以现在性爱派对可以停止了!
That's right! Your husband's home! So now the sex can stop!

285
00:19:41,311 --> 00:19:43,213
你知道我在说什么
You know what I mean.

286
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,717
你是在说什么?
What are you saying?

287
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,786
乔伊说你跟另一个男人在一起!
Joey said you're here with another man!

288
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:51,724
这里根本没有男人! 你怎么敢这样诬赖我!
There's no man in here! How dare you accuse me of that!

289
00:19:54,829 --> 00:20:00,436
好了,那或许你不介意 我和我的“朋友”到处看看
AII right. Then maybe you won't mind if me and my friend take a Iook around.

290
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,611
他根本搞不清楚状况!
He can't even see us!

291
00:20:06,777 --> 00:20:09,113
-我蛮喜欢这样的 -我也是
-I kind of Iiked it. -Me too.

292
00:20:12,218 --> 00:20:13,285
他在做什么?
What's he doing?

293
00:20:13,486 --> 00:20:17,024
我用枕头做成人形在床上
I arranged some piIIows on the bed to Iook Iike a guy.

294
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:23,498
卧室没有人 不过你们可能需要换新的枕头了
Bedroom's cIear. AIthough you might need some new piIIows.

295
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:26,836
好了,那我去检查客房
AII right, weII, I'II check the guest room.

296
00:20:34,513 --> 00:20:36,715
我为什么有闻到男人的古龙水味?
Why do I smeII men's coIogne?

297
00:20:38,918 --> 00:20:41,120
我想那是你的味道
I think that's you.

298
00:20:43,624 --> 00:20:47,696
喔,对喔,我刚刚才用 杂志磨擦到自己身上
Oh, yeah. I rubbed a magazine on myseIf earIier.

299
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:50,500
里面没有人,乔伊
There's nobody here, Joe.

300
00:20:51,268 --> 00:20:52,335
我想也没有
I guess not.

301
00:20:52,703 --> 00:20:57,141
我不敢相信你认为我会劈腿 你要对我道歉
I can't beIieve you thought I was cheating. You owe me an apoIogy.

302
00:20:57,576 --> 00:21:00,245
-你说的对,我很抱歉 -这是出自好意的误会
-You're right. I'm so sorry. -It's an honest mistake.

303
00:21:00,413 --> 00:21:02,548
可能发生在任何人身上的,再见
It couId happen to anybody. See you.

304
00:21:02,716 --> 00:21:05,119
等一下,等一下
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

305
00:21:05,286 --> 00:21:09,457
如果你才刚从土尔沙回来 你的行李怎么会比你先到?
If you just got back from TuIsa, how did your suitcase beat you here?

306
00:21:13,162 --> 00:21:16,533
我从防火梯爬了下去 而你就不能把这个藏到衣橱里吗?
I cIimbed down the fire escape, and you can't put that in the cIoset?

307
00:21:20,606 --> 00:21:23,409
所以,除了发酵过程不同之外…
So, with the exception of the fermentation process...

308
00:21:23,576 --> 00:21:26,980
啤酒跟麦酒基本上是相同的东西
...beer and aIe are basicaIIy the same thing.

309
00:21:27,948 --> 00:21:30,584
真引人入胜,不是吗?
Fascinating, isn't it?

310
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:34,223
或许你应该查一下“引人入胜”
Maybe you shouId Iook up ''fascinating.''

311
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,427
我来接!
I'II get it!

312
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,505
哈?罗斯家,我是麦克
HeIIo? Ross' pIace. Mike speaking.

313
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:49,809
要找你的
It's for you.

314
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:57,085
我不懂刚刚发生的事
I don't understand what just happened here.

315
00:21:59,456 --> 00:22:01,158
是怎么回事?
What's going on?

316
00:22:01,324 --> 00:22:02,459
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

317
00:22:02,626 --> 00:22:06,765
我会跟你说我在土尔沙是因为 今晚我想要跟摩妮卡在一起…
I toId you I was in TuIsa because I wanted to spend the night with Monica...

318
00:22:06,931 --> 00:22:10,769
而我不知道… 我以为你会不谅解
...and I didn't know-- I didn't think you'd understand.

319
00:22:11,838 --> 00:22:15,642
你以为我笨到会不谅解 老公想要跟老婆在一起吗?
You think I'm too dumb to understand a husband needs to be with his wife?

320
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:18,947
你以为我就像…
You think I'm, Iike....

321
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:24,053
-乔伊? -怎样
-Joey? -Yeah.

322
00:22:24,454 --> 00:22:27,625
我不知道该说什么 我们不应该欺骗你的
I don't know what to say. We shouIdn't have Iied to you.

323
00:22:27,792 --> 00:22:31,062
我觉得很难过,我能做什么补偿你吗?
I feeI so bad. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?

324
00:22:33,532 --> 00:22:36,903
你可以跟我一起去看球赛 虽然你说了你不行
You couId go to the game with me. Even though you said you couIdn't.

325
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:41,542
但是你欺骗我 然后又害我头肿了一包
But then you Iied to me and tricked me and gave me a bump on the head.

326
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,647
我很抱歉,这是我唯一无法做到的 我答应摩妮卡要跟她在一起了
I'm sorry, that's the one thing I can't do. I promised I'd be with Monica.

327
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:47,550
好吧
AII right.

328
00:22:48,318 --> 00:22:50,086
-你去吧 -什么?
-You can go. -What?

329
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:53,090
你应该去看球赛,没关系,我要你去
You shouId go to the game. It's okay. I want you to.

330
00:22:53,558 --> 00:22:56,228
-真的?你没关系吗? -是的,我没关系
-ReaIIy? You gonna be okay? -Yeah, I'II be fine.

331
00:22:56,562 --> 00:23:00,233
你知道的,或许我可以留在这里 然后练习一下勾引的技巧
You know, maybe I'II stay here and practice the art of seduction.

332
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:05,039
-你要换上运动服然后打扫吧 -一定会很性感撩人!
-You're gonna put sweats on and cIean. -It's gonna be so hot!

333
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,674
-拜 -拜

...I'm never gonna Iie to you again, okay?

338
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,958
而且我要你知道没有人认为你是愚蠢的
And I want you to know that nobody thinks you're stupid.

339
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:20,860
谢了,老兄
Thanks, man.

340
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:27,468

-Where you going? -Game's tomorrow night, Joe.

You know, we just drank some beer.

347
00:23:58,241 --> 00:24:00,977
麦克示范了正常社交礼仪的界线在哪
Mike pIayed with the boundaries of normaI sociaI conduct.

348
00:24:02,213 --> 00:24:05,049
