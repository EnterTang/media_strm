00:00:01,533 --> 00:00:02,668
嘿,罗斯

00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,675
-当然可以 -谢谢
-Sure. -Thank you.

4
00:00:10,841 --> 00:00:13,477
你相信从我家到这里的路上…
Can you beIieve no one between my apartment and here...

5
00:00:13,644 --> 00:00:15,813
竟然没有人愿意帮我拉拉链吗?
...offered to do that for me?

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,514
真是的
PeopIe.

7
00:00:18,383 --> 00:00:21,385
你穿这么漂亮做什么呢?
So why are you so dressed up?

8
00:00:21,552 --> 00:00:23,754
麦克要来接我去约会
Mike's picking me up for a date.

9
00:00:23,921 --> 00:00:26,890
交往得如何呢? 是不是越来越认真了?
How's that going? Is it getting serious?

10
00:00:27,057 --> 00:00:30,527
我不知道,我不知道 我是蛮喜欢他的
I don't know. I don't know. I mean, I Iike him.

11
00:00:30,694 --> 00:00:34,030
但是我还没有准备好要退出江湖
But am I ready to take my Grade A Ioins off the meat market?

12
00:00:34,198 --> 00:00:36,333
我不太确定
I'm not quite sure.

13
00:00:37,867 --> 00:00:41,870
我真的很欣赏你的约会态度
You know, I reaIIy admire your whoIe dating attitude.

14
00:00:42,038 --> 00:00:45,173
真是很健康的态度 我总是在想会不会进展太快了?…
It's so heaIthy. I'm aIways Iike, ''Is this moving too fast?

15
00:00:45,341 --> 00:00:47,910
会不会进展太慢了? 这将怎么发展呢?
Is this moving too sIow? Where's this going?''

16
00:00:48,077 --> 00:00:51,079
我知道 你就像是个戏剧女王
I know. You are a bit of a drama queen.

17
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:56,119
你真是太厉害了 男朋友一个接着一个…
You're so much better off. You just go from guy to guy having fun...

18
00:00:56,285 --> 00:01:00,589
享受乐趣,完全不担心没有结局
...and not worrying that it never turns into anything serious.

19
00:01:00,756 --> 00:01:02,958
我不敢说“完全不”
I wouIdn't say ''never.''

20
00:01:03,158 --> 00:01:05,427
有一次有个男的…
You know, there is that guy.

21
00:01:06,194 --> 00:01:08,162
好的,那个…?
Okay, weII, what about...?

22
00:01:08,831 --> 00:01:11,399
总该有个人吧
Okay, there's gotta be someone.

23
00:01:11,566 --> 00:01:16,303
-根本就没有!我就说吧 -喔,天啊,你说的没错!
-There isn't! That's what I'm saying. -Oh, my God, you're right!

24
00:01:16,471 --> 00:01:20,107
我知道,一段恋情才刚结束 马上又可以跟其他人约会
I know. And yet, here you are, aII ready for the next date.

25
00:01:21,443 --> 00:01:24,345
真不敢相信 我之前都没有注意到这点
I can't beIieve I never reaIized this before.

26
00:01:24,512 --> 00:01:28,783
我已经三十几岁了 从来没有爱情长跑过
I'm in my 30s, and I've never been in a Iong-term reIationship.

27
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,752
喔,天啊,我是有什么毛病?
Oh, my God, what's wrong with me?

28
00:01:35,657 --> 00:01:37,424
你没有什么毛病
There's nothing wrong with you.

29
00:01:37,591 --> 00:01:42,929
我是说,你不像那种 看起来会想结婚的人
I mean, you don't strike me as the type of person that wants to get married.

30
00:01:43,097 --> 00:01:45,466
我想结婚!
I want to get married!

31
00:01:45,632 --> 00:01:48,034
别这样,拜…别因为我而哭
No, pIease-- PIease don't cry because of me.

32
00:01:48,235 --> 00:01:53,106
我根本不知道我在说什么 我离婚三次了
I don't know what I'm taIking about, okay? I've been divorced three times.

33
00:01:53,273 --> 00:01:54,940
至少你结过婚
At Ieast you've been married.

34
00:01:55,108 --> 00:01:58,544
喔,我的天啊! 我竟然羡慕起罗斯了?
Oh, my God! I want to trade Iives with Ross?!

35
00:02:01,514 --> 00:02:03,482
菲比

36
00:02:03,783 --> 00:02:06,618
-怎么了? -没事,要跟你约会太兴奋了
-What's wrong? -Nothing. I'm excited about our date.

37
00:02:08,188 --> 00:02:12,858

-罗斯盖勒 -嘿
-Ross GeIIer. -Hey.

40
00:02:19,364 --> 00:02:22,300
你确定准备好了吗?
So are you sure you're ready to go?

41
00:02:23,335 --> 00:02:25,069
我看起来怎样?
How do I Iook?

42
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:30,174
-你皮包里有小镜子吗? -没有
-Do you have a compact in your purse? -No.

-Hey, Joey. -This girI won't turn around.

46
00:03:26,228 --> 00:03:29,765
我无法判断她是不是很辣 你觉得呢?
I can't teII if she's hot or not. What do you think?

47
00:03:29,932 --> 00:03:34,035
乔伊,我不会跟你一起把女性物化的
Joey, I am not going to objectify women with you.

48
00:03:34,303 --> 00:03:36,572
但是如果她的脸 跟她的屁股一样棒的话…
But if her face is as nice as her ass....

49
00:03:36,738 --> 00:03:38,940
-妈妈咪啊! -好的,谢谢
-Mama! -AII right. Thanks.

50
00:03:39,108 --> 00:03:42,744
-你有跟钱德讲电话了吗? -他这周末要留在土尔沙
-Have you taIked to ChandIer? -He has to stay in TuIsa this weekend.

51
00:03:42,911 --> 00:03:45,313
-为什么? -我不知道,有工作要做
-How come? -I don't know. He has to work.

52
00:03:45,481 --> 00:03:48,383
要赶那个…
There's some big rush on the....

53
00:03:51,452 --> 00:03:56,590
讨厌!我应该要开始 认真听他讲工作的事了
Damn it. I'm gonna have to start Iistening when he taIks about his job.

54
00:03:56,825 --> 00:03:58,859
你何不飞过去给他个惊喜呢?
Why don't you fIy out there and surprise him?

55
00:03:59,027 --> 00:04:00,695
我很想啊,我真的很想念他
I'd Iove to. I reaIIy miss him.

56
00:04:00,828 --> 00:04:01,828

But I can't. I have one day off and it's just too expensive.

57
00:04:01,962 --> 00:04:04,331
但是不行,我只有放一天假 而且机票太贵了

58
00:04:04,465 --> 00:04:06,667
真好玩,所以机票钱 比钱德还重要
Interesting. So ChandIer's not worth the price of a pIane ticket to you.

59
00:04:06,801 --> 00:04:07,868
制片:丹娜克莱恩波考

制片:温蒂诺勒
Of course he is.

61
00:04:10,905 --> 00:04:12,106
当然是钱德较重要

62
00:04:12,973 --> 00:04:14,208
或许我应该飞过去
Maybe I wiII go.

63

我们可以在土尔沙的饭店 来个二度小蜜月

66
00:04:20,948 --> 00:04:26,520
你应该带你那件黑色透明性感内衣 加上吊带裤袜
You shouId bring your bIack see-through teddy with the attached garters.

67
00:04:29,489 --> 00:04:33,626
-你怎么知道我有那件呢? -本来不知道,现在知道了
-How do you know I have one of those? -Didn't untiI just now.

68
00:04:35,962 --> 00:04:38,231
辣,不辣
Hot. Not hot.

69
00:04:39,365 --> 00:04:40,966
辣!
Hot!

70
00:04:41,667 --> 00:04:42,801
什么?
Excuse me?

71
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:48,741
我说我觉得你很辣
I said that I think you're hot.

72
00:04:48,941 --> 00:04:52,009
而…现在我糗死了
And...now I'm embarrassed.

73
00:04:52,445 --> 00:04:54,547
我以为你是说“嗨”
I thought you said ''hi.''

74
00:04:55,247 --> 00:04:57,314
如果是那样就好了
That wouId've been better.

75
00:04:57,483 --> 00:05:00,686
我来试试看,嗨,我是乔伊
I'II try that. Hi, I'm Joey.

76
00:05:00,853 --> 00:05:02,087
我是海莉
I'm HayIey.

77
00:05:03,088 --> 00:05:08,360
通常我不约在咖啡店遇到的女生出去
Look, I don't normaIIy ask out women that I meet in coffeehouses.

78
00:05:11,963 --> 00:05:13,530
保重
Gesundheit.

79
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:20,404
但是…
But....

80
00:05:21,305 --> 00:05:24,307
真是很难开口,我有点害羞
This is hard. I'm kind of shy.

81
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,080
真的,你应该去看医生的
SeriousIy, you shouId see someone about that coId.

82
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,282
如果感冒越来越严重,你可是会死的
If it gets much worse, you couId die.

83
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:39,022
-反正… -我很乐意跟你出去
-Anyway-- -I wouId Iove to go out with you.

84
00:05:39,523 --> 00:05:42,458
真的吗?太棒了
ReaIIy? Great.

85
00:05:42,626 --> 00:05:45,328
我有…我有开口约你吗?
Did I--? Did I actuaIIy ask you?

86
00:05:45,495 --> 00:05:48,764
由你说话的方式 我就猜得到你要做什么
That's just where you were going. I figured I'd heIp you out.

87
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:53,669
你不像是那种经常这样的男生吧?
You don't seem Iike the kind of guy who does this a Iot?

88
00:05:57,407 --> 00:05:59,709
真是的,阿甘,你传染给我了
Damn it, Gunther, you gave it to me.

89
00:06:05,347 --> 00:06:07,215
喔,是你
Oh, it's you.

90
00:06:07,382 --> 00:06:10,919
我带了素食热狗
With vegetarian corndogs.

91
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:14,022
别这样,我只想跟你说说话
Come on, I just want to taIk to you.

92
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:16,791
说什么?说我还剩下几个卵子吗?
About what? How few ova I have Ieft?

93
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,129
别这样,我只想为昨天发生的事道歉
Come on, I just wanna apoIogize for what happened yesterday.

94
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,997
我很抱歉,菲比
I'm sorry, Phoebe.

95
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:27,736
没关系,罗斯
That's okay, Ross.

96
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,775
-约会还好吗? -糟透了
-So how'd the date go? -WeII, it was awfuI.

97
00:06:34,943 --> 00:06:36,544
我几乎撑不过晚餐
I bareIy got through dinner.

98
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,312
每次我想到你说的话,我就哭了
Every time I thought about what you said, I cried.

99
00:06:39,813 --> 00:06:44,851
我非常肯定他整晚都惊恐的盯着我看
I'm pretty sure he spent most of the night just staring at me in horror.

100
00:06:45,018 --> 00:06:49,088
但是我无法真的确定 因为我的眼睛已经肿到张不开了
But I couIdn't know for sure because my eyes were swoIIen shut.

101
00:06:50,323 --> 00:06:52,725
你知道我不是故意要惹你哭的
You know I wasn't trying to make you cry.

102
00:06:52,893 --> 00:06:55,528
我本来是想要说一些很好听的话的
I was reaIIy trying to say something nice.

103
00:06:55,696 --> 00:06:59,699
我只是要说,即使你 从未有过认真的感情…
I was basicaIIy saying even though you've never been in a serious reIationship--

104
00:06:59,867 --> 00:07:02,735
-我们还要再讨论这个吗? -对不起
-Are we gonna do this again? -Sorry.

105
00:07:03,003 --> 00:07:05,872
-他还没打来吗? -你会打给这种女的吗?
-So he hasn't caIIed? -WouId you caII this girI:

106
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:09,241
“谢谢…美好…一晚”
''Thanks for...a IoveIy...evening''?

107
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,779
我觉得糟透了 这全都是我的错
Now I feeI terribIe. This is aII my fauIt.

108
00:07:12,945 --> 00:07:15,481
你知道更糟的是什么吗?
You know what you shouId feeI terribIe about?

109
00:07:15,648 --> 00:07:17,817
这男的有可能是可以认真的对象
This couId have been my serious guy.

110
00:07:17,984 --> 00:07:20,486
他很体贴、聪明又风趣
He was sweet and smart and funny.

111
00:07:20,652 --> 00:07:23,021
你知道要遇到这样的男生有多难吗?
You know how hard it is to meet a guy Iike that?

112
00:07:23,489 --> 00:07:25,591
我们的确是稀有动物
We are a rare breed.

113
00:07:29,795 --> 00:07:31,629
嘿,可能就是他哦
Hey, maybe that's him.

114
00:07:33,865 --> 00:07:35,133
喂?
HeIIo?

115
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,867
你可以等一下吗?
CouId you hoId on one sec?

116
00:07:37,035 --> 00:07:39,704
-我需要一点隐私 -是不是麦克呢?
-I need some privacy. -Is it Mike?

117
00:07:39,871 --> 00:07:43,708
不,是骚扰电话 我现在什么都接了
No, it's a heavy breather. I'II take what I can get.

118
00:07:44,575 --> 00:07:46,243
我在线上
I'm Iistening.

119
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,117
晚餐实在太棒了
What a great dinner.

120
00:07:53,284 --> 00:07:57,454
再次谢谢你让我吃最后一块蛋糕
Thanks again for Ietting me have that Iast piece of cake at the restaurant.

121
00:07:58,456 --> 00:08:01,826
不用客气,我要去煮咖啡
You're weIcome again. I'm gonna go make some coffee.

122
00:08:01,992 --> 00:08:04,561
-你要什么呢? -你有蛋糕吗?
-Can I get you anything? -Do you have any cake?

123
00:08:10,767 --> 00:08:12,936
真是进行的太顺利了
So this is going pretty good.

124
00:08:13,103 --> 00:08:16,340
晚餐很棒,我们有许多共同点
Dinner was nice. We've got a lot in common.

125
00:08:16,506 --> 00:08:18,574
“维多莉亚的秘密”性感内衣目录
Victoria's Secret.

126
00:08:18,742 --> 00:08:20,509
我们甚至喜欢相同的书
We even like the same books.

127
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,548
这幅画真可怕
There's a scary painting.

128
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:27,816
等等
Wait a minute.

129
00:08:27,984 --> 00:08:31,654
我记得好像被这幅画给吓过
I think I've been scared by that painting before.

130
00:08:32,989 --> 00:08:35,591
你知道吗? 这地方看起来真眼熟
You know what? This whole place looks familiar.

131
00:08:35,758 --> 00:08:37,860
我一定曾经来过这里
I have definitely been in this apartment.

132
00:08:38,026 --> 00:08:40,795
我看过这棵可怕的植物
I know I've seen this weird plant before.

133
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,332
它上次也是这样刺我!
It did that the last time!

134
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,469
喔,天啊 我跟这个女的约会过
Oh, my God. I've gone out with this girl before.

135
00:08:47,636 --> 00:08:50,005
没错!我们在这沙发上做过爱!
Yeah! We had sex on this couch!

136
00:08:50,205 --> 00:08:52,907
然后在那张椅子上 还有…,不对
And then on that chair, and-- No.

137
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:54,942
不对,没有在这里…
No, we didn't do it here...

138
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,980
这倒是很奇怪,看起来超适合的
...which is weird, because it seems like a perfectly good place.

139
00:08:59,147 --> 00:09:00,748
这就是为什么
That's why.

140
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:13,160
嘿,麦克,很抱歉这样跑过来 我可以进来吗?
Hey, Mike. Sorry to just drop by Iike this. Can I come in?

141
00:09:13,327 --> 00:09:14,795
当然
Sure.

142
00:09:15,362 --> 00:09:17,097
你是谁呢?
Who are you?

143
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,600
我是罗斯,菲比在咖啡屋的朋友
I'm Ross. Phoebe's friend from the coffeehouse?

144
00:09:20,767 --> 00:09:24,537
我真的非常需要跟你谈一件事
I reaIIy, reaIIy need to taIk to you about something.

145
00:09:24,738 --> 00:09:25,939
除非…
UnIess....

146
00:09:26,106 --> 00:09:30,443
你不是要拉我信什么教吧?
You're not gonna try and get me to join a cuIt, are you?

147
00:09:31,812 --> 00:09:35,248
没啦,因为,你知道的 你长得很像那种人
No, it's just, you know, you have that Iook.

148
00:09:35,816 --> 00:09:38,484
该死的199剪发!
Damn Supercuts!

149
00:09:40,553 --> 00:09:43,989
-怎么回事呢?菲比还好吗? -喔,还好,还好
-WeII, what's up? Is Phoebe okay? -Oh, yeah, yeah.

150
00:09:44,157 --> 00:09:47,393
菲比很好,但是…
Phoebe is great. But....

151
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,561
我是个蠢蛋
I'm an idiot, okay?

152
00:09:49,762 --> 00:09:51,830
就在你们出去约会前…
Right before you guys went out...

153
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,470
我不小心惹得她很难过
...I accidentaIIy got her aII upset.

154
00:09:59,438 --> 00:10:00,839
难怪她不对劲
That's why she was weird.

155
00:10:01,006 --> 00:10:03,242
是的,是啊,我…
Yes. Yeah, I....

156
00:10:05,644 --> 00:10:10,681
我说了些蠢话,关于她从没有过 认真的恋爱关系等等
Yeah, I said something stupid about her never having had a serious reIationship.

157
00:10:10,849 --> 00:10:14,918
但是你应该知道,她是很风趣的 很棒的一个人
But you shouId know, she is so much fun. A wonderfuI person.

158
00:10:15,086 --> 00:10:19,256
-拜,别将她判出局 -我不会判她出局的
-PIease, don't bIow her off. -I'm not gonna bIow her off.

159
00:10:19,423 --> 00:10:22,359
我才刚跟她说完电话 我们明晚要出去
I just spoke to her. We're going out tomorrow night.

160
00:10:22,526 --> 00:10:27,630
我是说,如果你没有意见的话 咖啡屋的陌生人
I mean, I hope that's okay with you, stranger from the coffeehouse.

161
00:10:30,434 --> 00:10:34,371
太棒了,所以她狂哭并没有吓跑你?
That's great. So the crying didn't turn you off?

162
00:10:35,239 --> 00:10:38,476
我刚刚跟一个躁郁症患者 结束九年的恋情
I just got out of a nine-year reIationship with a manic-depressive.

163
00:10:38,642 --> 00:10:41,144
跟她相比,菲比根本是只小猫
Compared to that, Phoebe's a Mousketeer.

164
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:44,514
好吧,那我就不需要再打扰你了
WeII, then, I didn't need to bother you.

165
00:10:44,682 --> 00:10:48,785
你,外加四个麦克汉尼根 都被我打扰了
You or the four other Mike Hanigans I bothered.

166
00:10:49,853 --> 00:10:54,924
其中一个还很高壮 有点爱打情骂俏
One of whom was quite Iarge and a IittIe fIirty.

167
00:10:59,662 --> 00:11:03,399
等等,等等 你刚刚说的是真的吗?
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Is that true what you said?

168
00:11:03,566 --> 00:11:06,936
菲比从未谈过认真的恋爱?
Phoebe's never had a serious reIationship?

169
00:11:07,603 --> 00:11:09,370
她当然有过
Of course she has.

170
00:11:09,605 --> 00:11:12,107
如果她没有谈过认真的恋爱…
If she's never had a serious reIationship...

171
00:11:12,274 --> 00:11:14,543
你认为我会到处去广播…
...do you think I'd go around broadcasting it...

172
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:19,114
像是无法克制的白痴一样 见人就说吗?
...Iike some kind of unstoppabIe moron?

173
00:11:20,316 --> 00:11:24,452
-但是你的确是那样说了 -是的,是的,我是说了
-But you did say it. -Yes. Yes, I did.

174
00:11:25,821 --> 00:11:28,289
而且我还会说…
And I wiII aIso say...

175
00:11:28,456 --> 00:11:31,091
我接下来要说的…
...what I'm about to say...

176
00:11:31,693 --> 00:11:33,795
相对于…
...vis--vis...

177
00:11:33,962 --> 00:11:36,131
以下的说法
...the foIIowing.

178
00:11:37,665 --> 00:11:43,103
菲比从未谈过认真的恋爱…
Phoebe has never had a serious reIationship...

179
00:11:43,538 --> 00:11:45,039
是从…
...since...

180
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:49,909
她超级认真地…
...her super-serious reIationship...

181
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,345
跟…
...with...

182
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:53,046
伟软分手之后
...Vikram.

183
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:57,350
-伟软? -怎样?那是真的名字
-Vikram? -What? That's a reaI name.

184
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,227
停停吧!
Stop it!

185
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:11,330
为什么不是派我去德州呢?
Why couIdn't they have sent me to Texas?

186
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,266
七点钟
Seven o'cIock.

187
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:16,636
或许我该去健身房
Maybe I'II hit the gym.

188
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,578
少来了,还是看情色频道好了
Who am I kidding? Pay-per-view porn.

189
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:42,527
-不要打扰!不要打扰! -惊喜吧!
-Do not disturb! Do not disturb! -Surprise!

190
00:12:44,729 --> 00:12:47,398
-摩妮卡? -一切都还好吧?
-Monica? -Is everything aII right?

191
00:12:47,565 --> 00:12:49,466
是啊,一切都很好 我刚刚…
Yeah, everything's great. I was just...

192
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:52,569
在看一些正常的电视节目
...watching some reguIar teIevision there.

193
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,939
这个惊喜真是太令人兴奋了
What a pIeasant surprise.

194
00:13:03,447 --> 00:13:06,783
-我去梳洗一下,好吗? -好的,亲爱的
-I'm gonna go freshen up, okay? -Okay, honey.

195
00:13:12,056 --> 00:13:13,824
差一点点
That was cIose.

196
00:13:25,168 --> 00:13:27,503
-喂 -嘿,瑞秋,是我
-HeIIo. -Hey, Rach, it's me.

197
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:31,974
我刚到钱德的房间 然后看到他…
Okay, I just got to ChandIer's room, and I caught him...

198
00:13:32,142 --> 00:13:34,176
正在猥亵他自己
...moIesting himseIf.

199
00:13:35,878 --> 00:13:37,980
那画面可能不是很好看
That couIdn't have been pretty.

200
00:13:38,147 --> 00:13:40,249
但是你知道的,男生常那样做的
But you know, guys do that.

201
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:41,917
但是,很奇怪的是…
WeII, the weird part is...

202
00:13:42,084 --> 00:13:45,554
他在看的是鲨鱼攻击影片耶!
...he was getting off... to a shark-attack show!

203
00:13:46,021 --> 00:13:50,659
-好恶! -是的!钱德竟然在看鲨鱼色情片!
-No! -Yes! ChandIer watches shark porn!

204
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,168
-在看鲨鱼的时候? -是啊
-WhiIe watching sharks? -Yeah.

205
00:14:00,335 --> 00:14:02,671
你确定他是在做那档事吗?
Are you sure that's what he was doing?

206
00:14:02,837 --> 00:14:05,739
你知道我看他 那样跳起来过多少次了吗?
You know how many times I've seen him jump up Iike that?

207
00:14:05,907 --> 00:14:07,908
相信我,我知道他在做什么
BeIieve me, I know what he was doing.

208
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,479
天啊!鲨鱼!
Man! Sharks!

209
00:14:11,646 --> 00:14:15,016
我就知道那个人有地方不对劲
I aIways knew there was something weird about that dude.

210
00:14:15,716 --> 00:14:17,517
你发誓过无论如何都要爱他的
You promised to Iove him no matter what.

211
00:14:17,685 --> 00:14:21,854
“无论如何”讲的是像如果他得病 还是杀了人什么的
''What'' means, Iike, if he gets a disease or kiIIs someone.

212
00:14:22,356 --> 00:14:26,026
而不是如果 他把小弟弟放到鲨鱼嘴里
Not if he gets his joIIies to Jaws.

213
00:14:27,094 --> 00:14:29,296
你知道吗?亲爱的 男生是很不一样的
You know what, honey? Guys are just different.

214
00:14:29,463 --> 00:14:32,065
他们喜欢一些我们无法理解的东西
They Iike things that we can't understand.

215
00:14:32,232 --> 00:14:34,567
我曾经约会过一个男的 总是想要假装…
I once dated this guy who wanted to pretend...

216
00:14:34,735 --> 00:14:37,905
他是考古学家 而我是…
...that he was an archeoIogist, and I was this...

217
00:14:38,071 --> 00:14:43,075
他从冰块中解救出来 调皮的山顶洞女人
...naughty cavewoman who he unfroze from a bIock of ice.

218
00:14:44,577 --> 00:14:46,545
你是在说我哥吗?
Are you taIking about my brother?

219
00:14:46,713 --> 00:14:48,881
我装得不像,对不对?
I didn't disguise that very weII, did I?

220
00:14:51,784 --> 00:14:52,852
-嘿 -嗨
-Hey. -Hi.

221
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:57,122
我昨晚跟一个女孩子出去 我到一半的时候才发现…
I went out with this girI Iast night. HaIfway through our date I reaIized...

222
00:14:57,289 --> 00:14:58,924
我已经跟她上过床了
...I aIready sIept with her.

223
00:15:00,893 --> 00:15:05,364
所以你已经跟全纽约的女人上过床了 现在只是从头开始再来一次?
You've sIept with aII the women in N.Y., and now you're going around again?

224
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:07,032
这还不是最奇怪的地方
That's not even the weird part.

225
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,369
-她竟然不记得跟我上过床了! -你也不记得跟她上过床啊
-She didn't remember sIeeping with me! -You don't remember sIeeping with her.

226
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:15,206
但是她应该要记得的 我可是很令人难忘的!
But she shouId remember sIeeping with me. I am very memorabIe!

227
00:15:16,407 --> 00:15:18,308
-你们知道的 -我们怎么会知道呢?
-You guys know. -How do we know?

228
00:15:18,476 --> 00:15:21,712
-我们又没有跟你上过床 -那是谁的错呢?
-We've never sIept with you. -And whose fauIt is that?

229
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:25,383
又没有什么大不了的 你忘了,她忘了
What's the big deaI? You forgot, she forgot.

230
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,452
-或许那天晚上你没有达阵! -嘿!
-Maybe you were having an off night. -Hey!

231
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,991
我向来都有达阵的,好吗?
I never have an off night. Okay?

232
00:15:34,158 --> 00:15:37,527
虽然有时候如果我吃太胀 可能就不会觉得很性感
AIthough, sometimes if I'm a IittIe bIoated, I don't feeI that sexy.

233
00:15:37,695 --> 00:15:40,464
但是即使是那样,我都比别人强!
But even then, I'm better than most!

234
00:15:41,298 --> 00:15:44,400
亲爱的,你何不就此释怀 再约她出去呢?
Honey, why don't you just Iet it go and ask her out again?

235
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:47,536
你们都是骚货 你们根本都不记得跟谁上过床
You're both so sIutty, you don't remember who you sIept with.

236
00:15:47,704 --> 00:15:49,305
你们是天生的一对
You're made for each other.

237
00:15:51,141 --> 00:15:53,076
真有趣
Interesting.

238
00:15:54,378 --> 00:15:57,747
好吧,我会再跟她出去 然后忘了过去
WeII, I'II go out with her again and I'II try to get past it.

239
00:15:57,914 --> 00:16:00,583
不吃盐!会胀气!
No saIt! BIoaty!

240
00:16:00,784 --> 00:16:02,218
-乔伊? -干嘛?
-Joey? -What?

241
00:16:02,385 --> 00:16:04,452
你会觉得鲨鱼很性感吗?
You don't think sharks are sexy, do you?

242
00:16:04,621 --> 00:16:06,222
不会
No.

243
00:16:06,555 --> 00:16:09,391
等一下,等等 小美人鱼是鲨鱼吗?
Wait a minute. Wait, what was the LittIe Mermaid?

244
00:16:13,229 --> 00:16:15,331
门没锁!
It's open!

245
00:16:15,864 --> 00:16:20,335
-嘿 -麦克打电话来了,我们要再约会了!
-Hey. -Mike caIIed! We're going out again!

246
00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:25,841
一件小事,我去找麦克谈过
Quick thing. I went to taIk to Mike.

247
00:16:26,008 --> 00:16:27,342
什么?
What?

248
00:16:27,576 --> 00:16:29,945
你做…? 你做了什么?罗斯
What did you--? What did you do, Ross?

249
00:16:30,112 --> 00:16:33,180
喔,天啊,光这样你就生气了
Oh, boy. You got mad at that part.

250
00:16:33,848 --> 00:16:36,750
我过去找他,告诉他…
I went over there, you know, to teII him how....

251
00:16:36,918 --> 00:16:40,521
你是个很棒的人,但是…
How great you are. But....

252
00:16:40,688 --> 00:16:43,390
嗯,你知道我的,话太多了
WeII, you know me. BIah-bIah-bIah.

253
00:16:45,727 --> 00:16:49,430
-然后我最后竟然告诉他… -什么?
-And I ended up teIIing him that.... -What?

254
00:16:50,564 --> 00:16:53,699
你有过六年的恋情…
You had a six-year-Iong reIationship...

255
00:16:53,868 --> 00:16:55,970
跟一个叫做伟软的人
...with a guy named Vikram.

256
00:16:57,638 --> 00:16:59,639
什么?为什么?
What? Why?

257
00:16:59,806 --> 00:17:02,475
因为,他…
WeII, he seemed...

258
00:17:02,643 --> 00:17:08,581
在我说你从未谈过 认真的恋情之后,好像有点惊讶
...to bum hard when I toId him you'd never been in a serious reIationship.

259
00:17:11,918 --> 00:17:14,754
如果你不是刚跟我 最要好的朋友生下小孩
If you hadn't just had a baby with my best friend...

260
00:17:14,921 --> 00:17:18,291
我跟撒旦发誓…
...I swear to Lucifer...

261
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:23,462
一只狂犬病疯狗正要吃掉 你裤档里的那根东西了!
...a rabid dog wouId be feasting on your dangIers right now!

262
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:27,066
我想如果你知道多一点关于伟软的事…
I think you'II feeI differentIy when you know...

263
00:17:27,233 --> 00:17:29,569
你会感觉好多了
...a IittIe bit about Vikram.

264
00:17:30,135 --> 00:17:32,136
好的,他是…
Okay, he's a....

265
00:17:32,304 --> 00:17:35,474
他是风筝设计师
He's a kite designer.

266
00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:40,645
而且他曾经跟于美人约会过
And he used to date Oprah.

267
00:17:42,314 --> 00:17:46,150
我不会跟你唱双簧说谎的,罗斯
I'm not going aIong with some Iie you made up, Ross.

268
00:17:46,318 --> 00:17:48,720
-我会跟他老实说 -很好
-I'm just gonna be honest with him. -Good.

269
00:17:48,887 --> 00:17:50,621
跟他老实说
Just be honest with him.

270
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:52,891
-我没有什么好隐瞒的 -没错
-I have nothing to be ashamed of. -No.

271
00:17:53,057 --> 00:17:57,528
就算我的每段感情 没都有超过一个月…
So I haven't been in a reIationship that Iasted Ionger than a month.

272
00:17:57,696 --> 00:18:00,164
那又如何呢?是啊 我是没有过真正的男朋友
Okay? I haven't had a reaI boyfriend.

273
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:04,935
如果他无法接受 那他可以离开,我想他会离开的
If he can't handIe it, then he can Ieave. Which he wiII.

274
00:18:05,103 --> 00:18:08,739
而这一切都没有关系 我只不过会永远孤单而已
And, you know, that's okay. So I'II just be aIone forever.

275
00:18:08,906 --> 00:18:11,674
都没关系了,一切都会没事的
You know, aII right. It'II be fine. It'II be fine.

276
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:15,445
我就跟寡妇还有同性恋一起出去玩嘛
I'II go on waIking tours with widows and Iesbians.

277
00:18:17,881 --> 00:18:19,816
-我去开门 -好的
-I'II get it. -Okay.

278
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:26,823
让我想想有哪一次,开门的人不是你
I'm trying to remember the Iast time I opened a door and you weren't there.

279
00:18:29,927 --> 00:18:32,595
菲比,你还好吗?
Phoebe, are you okay?

280
00:18:34,431 --> 00:18:37,634
还好,只不过是…
Yeah. There's just....

281
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:41,137
有件事你必须要知道
There's something you shouId know.

282
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,207
伟软刚打电话来
Vikram just caIIed.

283
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,445
所以在经历二十五年的婚姻之后 这真是很让人惊讶
So it was reaIIy a shock after 25 years of marriage...

284
00:18:50,612 --> 00:18:53,548
我的模范父母竟然要离婚 我真的很难接受
...my parents getting divorced. I took it the hardest...

285
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:56,484
-因为我是老么 -当然
-...because I was the youngest. -Sure. Yeah.

286
00:18:56,652 --> 00:18:58,920
你怎么会忘了我是谁?
How can you not remember me?

287
00:18:59,655 --> 00:19:00,688
什么?
What?

288
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,823
你怎么会忘了我们上过床?
How couId you not remember that we sIept together?

289
00:19:02,991 --> 00:19:05,993
-什么?何时? -我不知道!
-What? When? -I don't know!

290
00:19:06,595 --> 00:19:09,865
我真的、真的认为 如果有我会记得的
I reaIIy, reaIIy think I wouId remember sIeeping with you.

291
00:19:10,031 --> 00:19:13,468
快点,快点 仔细回想,好吗?那就在…
Come on, come on. Search your brain, aII right? It was...

292
00:19:13,634 --> 00:19:17,271
之前某个时候 我在这里,你在这里
...a certain amount of time ago. I was here. You were here.

293
00:19:17,438 --> 00:19:19,874
我们在这里,这里,这里…
We had sex here, here, here....

294
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,975
没有那里,嘿咻
Not there.

295
00:19:22,142 --> 00:19:25,279
-想起来了吗? -没,一点印象也没有
-Anything? -No, it's not ringing any beIIs.

296
00:19:25,446 --> 00:19:27,615
天啊,女人!
My God, woman!

297
00:19:27,782 --> 00:19:30,650
你跟多少人上过床 让你根本不记得我?
How many peopIe have you been with not to remember this?

298
00:19:30,818 --> 00:19:33,953
嘿,海莉 我们真的要修理那个门把了
Hey, HayIey. We reaIIy gotta fix that doorknob.

299
00:19:35,689 --> 00:19:36,823
乔伊?
Joey?

300
00:19:41,428 --> 00:19:43,462
我跟你上过床!
I sIept with you!

301
00:19:45,198 --> 00:19:49,034
而且很明显的你记得我! 嘿,表示我还不赖!
And you obviousIy remember me! Hey, I stiII got it!

302
00:19:49,202 --> 00:19:51,437
所以我们还好嘛
So we're good.

303
00:19:52,038 --> 00:19:54,207
我自己出去
I'II Iet myseIf out.

304
00:19:56,009 --> 00:19:58,977
然后我说,伟软…
And I said, ''Okay, Vikram...

305
00:19:59,145 --> 00:20:02,581
你不能每次寂寞就打电话给我
...you can't just caII every time you get IoneIy.

306
00:20:02,748 --> 00:20:06,218
在你跟瑞秋上床之后 你就没有那个权力了
You gave up that right when you sIept with RacheI.''

307
00:20:07,386 --> 00:20:09,755
瑞秋?我以为她才刚生下罗斯的小孩
RacheI? I thought she just had a baby with Ross.

308
00:20:09,955 --> 00:20:11,889
是啊,嗯…
Yeah, weII....

309
00:20:12,057 --> 00:20:13,891
是啊
Yeah.

310
00:20:14,226 --> 00:20:17,328
艾玛的出生证明上或许生父是罗斯…
But Emma's birth certificate might say ''GeIIer'' ...

311
00:20:17,495 --> 00:20:20,464
但是她长得像伟软
...but her eyes say ''Mukherjee.''

312
00:20:21,699 --> 00:20:25,602
这实在太糟了 而且他还吸强力胶?
That is so wrong. And on top of that, he's a gIue sniffer?

313
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,705
我知道,但是他打来时 我的心就飞向他了
I know. But he caIIs, and my heart goes to him.

314
00:20:28,873 --> 00:20:34,178
你知道的,那个浑蛋是个很会 说话的风筝设计师
You know, that bastard is one smooth-taIking freeIance kite designer.

315
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:39,116
如果你要的话,我可以帮你修理他
If you want, I'II mess him up for you.

316
00:20:41,052 --> 00:20:42,419
真的吗?
You wouId do that?

317
00:20:42,586 --> 00:20:46,156
除非他很大只 如果他真的很大只,我会给他…
UnIess he's big. If he's reaIIy big, I'II send him...

318
00:20:46,323 --> 00:20:47,824
一封信,骂死他
...a rude Ietter.

319
00:20:49,326 --> 00:20:52,463
我想有更好的人在等着你
I think there's somebody better out there for you.

320
00:20:53,129 --> 00:20:56,832
我是说,你知道的,我… 我不是指我,但是…
I mean, you know, I'm-- I'm not saying me, but....

321
00:20:57,834 --> 00:21:00,203
或许…是我
Maybe...me.

322
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:05,741
而且你不用担心我会吸强力胶
And you don't have to worry about gIue-sniffing with me.

323
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:09,112
虽然有时候我会闻麦克笔的味道
AIthough, I do smeII the occasionaI Magic Marker.

324
00:21:10,846 --> 00:21:13,715
是啊,反正,我只是…
Yeah. Anyway, I just....

325
00:21:14,184 --> 00:21:16,452
我想我可以让你快乐
I think I can make you happy.

326
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:22,591
-好了,我办不到 -怎么了?
-Okay, I can't do this. -What's wrong?

327
00:21:22,758 --> 00:21:26,795
根本没有伟软这个人 罗斯乱扯的
WeII, there is no Vikram. Ross made him up.

328
00:21:26,962 --> 00:21:28,430
因为我…
Because I....

329
00:21:28,597 --> 00:21:31,499
我从未有过爱情长跑
I reaIIy never have been in a Iong-term reIationship.

330
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:36,204
我从未跟男人同居过 从来没有庆祝交往一周年
I've never Iived with a guy. I've never even ceIebrated an anniversary.

331
00:21:36,371 --> 00:21:38,172
所以…
So....

332
00:21:39,474 --> 00:21:42,376
如果这对你而言太奇怪…
If that's too weird for you...

333
00:21:42,577 --> 00:21:44,713
所以你想现在就走人 我可以理解
...and you want to Ieave, I understand.

334
00:21:44,879 --> 00:21:48,316
事实上,我要闭上双眼 让这一切不至于太尴尬
In fact, I'II cIose my eyes to make it Iess awkward.

335
00:21:55,723 --> 00:21:57,858
你亲了我
You kissed me.

336
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:03,764
-你不认为我是怪人吗? -不
-You don't think I'm a totaI freak? -No.

337
00:22:03,931 --> 00:22:05,598
那么…
WeII....

338
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:07,835
那,我可不…?
Look, can I...?

339
00:22:08,001 --> 00:22:11,103
我可不可以认为你有点怪 但又有点酷…
Can I think you're a IittIe weird and aIso cooI...

340
00:22:11,271 --> 00:22:13,740
因为你告诉我事情的真相 而且让我想亲你?
...for teIIing me the truth and aIso want to kiss you?

341
00:22:13,907 --> 00:22:16,243
我想应该可以
I guess so.

342
00:22:16,409 --> 00:22:18,878
我可不可以认为,你亲我真是很酷…
Can I think it's cooI that you kissed me...

343
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,548
而且我想要亲回去?
...and aIso want to kiss you again?

344
00:22:23,183 --> 00:22:27,387
有一点担心奇异笔的事可以吗?
And be a IittIe concerned about the Magic Markers?

345
00:22:27,587 --> 00:22:29,521
当然可
DefiniteIy.

346
00:22:36,028 --> 00:22:38,430
我是伟软
This is Vikram.

347
00:22:41,767 --> 00:22:46,304
我需要跟你谈我们之间 那段长期的恋情
I need to talk to you about the long-term relationship we had.

348
00:22:46,472 --> 00:22:50,408
回电给我,我在我的风筝工作室
Call me. I am in my kite-making studio.

349
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,648
嗨,亲爱的,我回来了
Hi, honey, I'm home.

350
00:22:58,349 --> 00:22:59,617
嗨
Hi.

351
00:22:59,785 --> 00:23:02,487
-旅途还好吗? -不错
-How was your fIight? -It was great.

352
00:23:02,653 --> 00:23:05,622
我从飞机上的购物目录订了浮板
I ordered a pooI fIoat from the Sky MaII.

353
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:09,826
为什么我要订呢?
Why'd I do that?

354
00:23:11,196 --> 00:23:13,063
过来坐下吧
Why don't you sit down.

355
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,698
放轻松、舒服点
Get yourseIf comfortabIe.

356
00:23:14,865 --> 00:23:17,534
因为我有个小…
Because I have a IittIe...

357
00:23:17,702 --> 00:23:19,937
惊喜要给你
...surprise for you.

358
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:23,673
喔,喔,喔 土尔沙现在一定是五点…
WeII, weII, weII. It must be 5:00 in TuIsa...

359
00:23:23,841 --> 00:23:27,677
因为纽约现在是“六”点(音近性)!
...because it's ''sex o'cIock'' in N.Y.C.!

360
00:23:29,413 --> 00:23:33,750
好了,这代表我有多爱你
Okay. This is how much I Iove you.

361
00:23:34,784 --> 00:23:36,920
大白鲨…
The great white....

362
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:44,193
亲爱的?
Honey?

363
00:23:44,393 --> 00:23:47,796
为什么要我看一群鲨鱼游来游去呢?
Why am I watching a bunch of sharks swimming around?

364
00:23:48,965 --> 00:23:50,966
这不是…? 这不是你爱看的吗?
Is this--? Is this not the good part?

365
00:23:51,434 --> 00:23:55,871
要我快转吗? 转到露齿…比较多的地方吗?
Do you want me to fast-forward to something...toothier?

366
00:23:56,339 --> 00:24:00,342
不,我只是想确定 你是不是拿错了录影带
No, I'm just not sure that you got the right movie, that's aII.

367
00:24:01,477 --> 00:24:04,046
录影带店里只有这一卷
This is the onIy one they had at our video store.

368
00:24:04,246 --> 00:24:07,348
不过他们倒是有一部叫“鳄鱼杀手”的
Though they did have something caIIed Crocodile Killers.

369
00:24:07,515 --> 00:24:10,317
还是说,你非要鲨鱼不可呢?
Or does it aIways have to be sharks?

370
00:24:12,454 --> 00:24:14,488
为什么我非要鲨鱼不可?
Does what aIways have to be sharks?

371
00:24:14,656 --> 00:24:16,858
听着,我们可以来点别的
Look, we can do something eIse.

372
00:24:17,024 --> 00:24:21,161
你要我到浴缸里…再用力扭吗?
Do you want me to get into the tub and...thrash?

373
00:24:22,964 --> 00:24:26,533
-到底是怎么回事? -没关系,没关系的
-What's going on? -It's okay. It's okay.

374
00:24:26,701 --> 00:24:28,335
我还是爱你的
I stiII Iove you.

375
00:24:28,502 --> 00:24:32,472
-让我了解这一切 -是你应该让我了解这一切!
-Let me be a part of this. -Let me be a part of this!

376
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:36,077
我看到你在土尔沙做的事
I saw what you were doing in TuIsa.

377
00:24:36,277 --> 00:24:39,012
愤怒的鲨鱼让你“性”奋!
Angry sharks turn you on!

378
00:24:40,381 --> 00:24:41,982
不,并没有
No, they don't.

379
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:46,787
那为什么你一边看着们 一边自己玩呢?
Then why were you watching them and giving yourseIf a treat?

380
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:50,656
喔,天啊!当你一进来 我就转台了
Oh, my God! When you came in, I switched the channeI.

381
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:53,426
我本来只是在看一般的色情片
I was just watching reguIar porn.

382
00:24:54,594 --> 00:24:55,728
真的吗?
ReaIIy?

383
00:24:55,896 --> 00:25:00,200
是的,只不过是一些正常 老套、美式的女对女动作片
Yes. Just some good, oId-fashioned, American, girI-on-girI action.

384
00:25:02,202 --> 00:25:05,405
这件事真是让我太高兴了
Can I teII you how happy that makes me?

385
00:25:06,906 --> 00:25:09,874
你是个不可思议的老婆
You are an amazing wife.

386
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:13,412
真的,太不可思议了 你真的愿意为我这样做?
ReaIIy, you are amazing. You were actuaIIy gonna do this for me?

387
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:17,883
你是怎么会有这样的 意志跟谅解呢?
Where do you find the strength and the understanding for that?

388
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:21,920
因为我现在非常、非常地醉
I'm very, very drunk right now.

389
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,063
通常我会去跟她搭讪的 但是我的自信已经动摇了
OrdinariIy, I wouId taIk to her, but my confidence is shaken.

390
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,765
我有跟她上床吗? 我没有跟她上床吗?
Did I sIeep with her? Did I not sIeep with her?

391
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:40,404
或许该是你反省的时候了 检讨你的整个约会态度
Maybe this is a wake-up caII. You know, about your whoIe dating attitude.

392
00:25:40,571 --> 00:25:45,575
你已经三十好几了 没有谈过一个长期的恋爱
You're in your 30s and you have never been in a Iong-term reIationship.

393
00:25:45,943 --> 00:25:47,844
女人从一个换到另一个…
Here you go from woman to woman...

394
00:25:48,011 --> 00:25:50,413
没有意义的关系 换到另一个没有意义的关系
...meaningIess experience to meaningIess experience.

395
00:25:50,581 --> 00:25:54,217
从不担心这些恋情都没有任何的发展
Never even worrying that it doesn't turn into something more serious.

396
00:25:54,385 --> 00:25:57,520
你说的没错,我爱死我的人生了!
You're right. I Iove my Iife!

397
00:26:01,591 --> 00:26:04,060
事实上我跟她上过床了
I actuaIIy did sIeep with her.
