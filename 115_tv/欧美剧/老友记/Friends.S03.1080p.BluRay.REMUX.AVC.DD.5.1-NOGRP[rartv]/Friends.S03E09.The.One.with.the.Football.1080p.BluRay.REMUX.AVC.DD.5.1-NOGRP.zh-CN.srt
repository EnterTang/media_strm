1
00:00:04,192 --> 00:00:05,557
Oh, come on!

2
00:00:06,395 --> 00:00:08,056
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too.

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,755
You know, instead of watching
football, you could help.

4
00:00:10,966 --> 00:00:12,262
We know.

5
00:00:13,868 --> 00:00:17,599
Hey, Rachel, you wanna put the
marshmallows in concentric circles.

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,032
No, Mon, you want to put
them in concentric circles.

7
00:00:22,209 --> 00:00:24,973
I want to do this.

8
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,781
Every year.

9
00:00:36,556 --> 00:00:37,682
The One With the Football

10
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:25,231
To the ten, to the five.
Touchdown, Giants!

11
00:01:25,868 --> 00:01:30,931
You know, for once I am gonna sit down
and try to watch one of these things.

12
00:01:31,707 --> 00:01:33,231
Halftime.

13
00:01:35,177 --> 00:01:36,940
Who wants to throw
the ball around?

14
00:01:37,113 --> 00:01:40,105
- Get a little three-on-three going?
- That would be so much fun.

15
00:01:40,282 --> 00:01:43,876
- Can I play too?
- I've never played football, like, ever.

16
00:01:44,052 --> 00:01:46,919
Great! You can cover Chandler.

17
00:01:48,123 --> 00:01:49,886
No, no. I don't really want to play.

18
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:53,518
You never want to do anything
since you and Janice broke up.

19
00:01:53,695 --> 00:01:57,994
That's not true. I wanted to wear my
bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day.

20
00:01:58,165 --> 00:02:01,498
I wanted to start drinking in the morning.
Don't say I don't have goals!

21
00:02:02,102 --> 00:02:04,696
Chandler, you have to start
getting over her, all right?

22
00:02:04,872 --> 00:02:08,535
If you play, you get some fresh air.
Maybe it'll take your mind off Janice.

23
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:12,439
If you don't play, everyone will be mad
at you because the teams won't be even.

24
00:02:12,612 --> 00:02:15,376
- Come on.
- All right, I'll play.

25
00:02:15,548 --> 00:02:18,415
But I don't like you.

26
00:02:19,986 --> 00:02:22,079
- Let's do it! Ross?
- What?

27
00:02:22,255 --> 00:02:24,155
Wanna play football?

28
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:30,124
Monica and I aren't supposed
to play football.

29
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:32,722
Says who? Your mom?

30
00:02:33,765 --> 00:02:34,754
- Yeah.
- Yes.

31
00:02:36,635 --> 00:02:38,603
"What do you mean?"
She asks her boyfriend...

32
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,135
...really scared to hear the answer.

33
00:02:41,505 --> 00:02:45,373
Every Thanksgiving, we used
to have a touch football game...

34
00:02:45,543 --> 00:02:47,238
...called the Geller Bowl.

35
00:02:47,411 --> 00:02:49,743
No, no, no. You say that proudly!

36
00:02:50,748 --> 00:02:54,184
Anyway, Ross and I
were always captains.

37
00:02:54,351 --> 00:02:57,945
It got kind of competitive,
and one year, Geller Bowl VI...

38
00:02:58,121 --> 00:03:01,522
...I accidentally broke Ross' nose.

39
00:03:02,792 --> 00:03:04,919
It was so not an accident.

40
00:03:05,161 --> 00:03:07,527
She saw I was about to tag her,
so she threw...

41
00:03:07,697 --> 00:03:10,665
...her big fat
grandma-arm elbow in my face...

42
00:03:10,866 --> 00:03:12,800
...and just kept running.

43
00:03:12,968 --> 00:03:14,959
To score the winning touchdown,
by the way.

44
00:03:16,872 --> 00:03:19,670
You did not win the game.
The touchdown didn't count...

45
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:24,868
...because of the spectacularly
illegal, and savage, nose-breaking.

46
00:03:26,047 --> 00:03:27,275
I won the game.

47
00:03:27,481 --> 00:03:31,349
Oh, yeah? Then how come
you didn't get the Geller Cup?

48
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,454
There was a Geller Cup?

49
00:03:35,122 --> 00:03:37,818
Yes, it was the trophy
you got if you won the game.

50
00:03:37,992 --> 00:03:41,324
But our dad said nobody won that game,
and he was sick of our fighting.

51
00:03:41,494 --> 00:03:44,088
So he took the trophy...

52
00:03:49,803 --> 00:03:52,067
...threw it in the lake.

53
00:03:52,839 --> 00:03:54,829
And was the curse lifted?

54
00:03:56,842 --> 00:03:58,036
Anyway...

55
00:03:58,844 --> 00:04:02,007
...that's why Mom said we were
not allowed to play football again.

56
00:04:02,481 --> 00:04:05,382
You know what?
I think we should play a game.

57
00:04:05,651 --> 00:04:07,585
I mean, come on.
It's been 12 years.

58
00:04:08,354 --> 00:04:09,786
Can I see you for a second?

59
00:04:14,993 --> 00:04:18,827
- Wuss!
- All right, we're gonna play.

60
00:04:18,997 --> 00:04:20,521
Wait. How are we gonna get there?

61
00:04:20,698 --> 00:04:22,893
Because my mom
won't let me cross the street.

62
00:04:28,372 --> 00:04:30,465
Pheebs, here you go.

63
00:04:31,408 --> 00:04:33,069
- Okay, let's bring it in.
- Wait.

64
00:04:33,243 --> 00:04:34,403
Honey, throw it to me!

65
00:04:34,578 --> 00:04:35,567
Here you go.

66
00:04:38,681 --> 00:04:41,172
That almost hit me in the face!

67
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,181
All right, we have to pick captains.

68
00:04:43,352 --> 00:04:45,718
And then Tennilles.

69
00:04:47,657 --> 00:04:49,181
Okay, so how do we decide that?

70
00:04:49,358 --> 00:04:51,622
- Well, why don't we just bunny up?
- What?

71
00:04:51,794 --> 00:04:54,193
- Bunny!
- Bunny!

72
00:04:54,796 --> 00:04:57,230
Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains.

73
00:04:57,766 --> 00:05:01,634
There must be a place in heaven for people
who hung out with you in high school.

74
00:05:02,704 --> 00:05:05,969
Okay. So I bunnied first,
which means I get to pick first. Joey.

75
00:05:06,274 --> 00:05:08,104
- Thank you.
- Monica!

76
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:10,106
I'm your best friend.

77
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:14,914
Sweetie, don't worry,
you'll get picked. Chandler.

78
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,413
- Ross!
- Phoebe.

79
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:23,750
Sweetie, now I pick you.

80
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:27,450
You don't pick me.
You're stuck with me!

81
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:29,661
Okay. All right. So let's see.

82
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,923
Let's play from the trash can
to the light post, right?

83
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,656
Two-hand touch. We'll kick off.

84
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:37,528
All right, people, listen.
I've got exactly 28 minutes...

85
00:05:37,703 --> 00:05:39,671
...before I have to baste again.

86
00:05:39,871 --> 00:05:41,964
Wow, just like in the pros.

87
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,107
Come on. Huddle up!

88
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:47,676
- All right, huddle up right over here!
- Wait for me! Wait for me!

89
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,280
Oh, cool! This is my first huddle.

90
00:05:51,249 --> 00:05:52,238
- Okay.
- Okay.

91
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:55,579
So what do you guys
really think of Chandler?

92
00:05:57,221 --> 00:05:59,849
- You know what you're doing, right?
- Yeah.

93
00:06:00,024 --> 00:06:01,252
Joey's going to catch it.

94
00:06:01,425 --> 00:06:04,189
- And you and I are going to block.
- What's block?

95
00:06:04,362 --> 00:06:08,764
- I thought you knew what you were doing.
- I thought you meant in life.

96
00:06:09,366 --> 00:06:10,993
Break!

97
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:15,035
The ball is Janice.
The ball is Janice.

98
00:06:20,377 --> 00:06:21,708
Son of a...!

99
00:06:22,311 --> 00:06:24,211
- Come on!
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

100
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,042
You know what?
We're just gonna throw it.

101
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,512
I got it!

102
00:06:29,752 --> 00:06:31,151
Go, go, go!

103
00:06:39,894 --> 00:06:43,591
Score! Seven to nothing!

104
00:06:44,298 --> 00:06:46,528
Okay, honey,
just so that I'm clear on this.

105
00:06:46,701 --> 00:06:50,637
You said in the huddle that if Joey caught
the ball, you'd be the one to stop him.

106
00:06:50,805 --> 00:06:53,329
Now, you didn't.
So is that like a football strategy?

107
00:06:53,507 --> 00:06:56,806
Yeah, it was part of my plan
to fall instantly behind. So...

108
00:06:56,977 --> 00:06:58,239
Come on. Let's go.

109
00:06:58,779 --> 00:07:00,007
Losers walk.

110
00:07:00,213 --> 00:07:02,875
Yeah? Losers talk.

111
00:07:03,049 --> 00:07:05,574
No. No. No. Actually, losers rhyme.

112
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,053
Forty-three.

113
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:10,347
Seventy-four.

114
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,987
- You wanna go shotgun?
- Yeah.

115
00:07:18,631 --> 00:07:20,462
- Hike.
- One Mississippi, two Mississippi...

116
00:07:20,633 --> 00:07:22,691
Over here! Over here!

117
00:07:23,601 --> 00:07:24,761
I almost caught that one!

118
00:07:26,371 --> 00:07:29,431
Great. Now the score's
7 to almost 7.

119
00:07:30,008 --> 00:07:31,134
Okay.

120
00:07:31,309 --> 00:07:34,437
On this play, I want you to do
a down-and-out to the right, okay?

121
00:07:34,712 --> 00:07:36,474
- Break!
- Wait. What am I gonna do?

122
00:07:36,647 --> 00:07:37,978
You?

123
00:07:38,148 --> 00:07:39,137
You go long.

124
00:07:39,316 --> 00:07:40,544
Well, how long?

125
00:07:40,717 --> 00:07:43,584
- Until we start to look very small.
- Okay.

126
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,517
Break!

127
00:07:46,123 --> 00:07:47,920
- Hike.
- One Mississippi, two Mississippi...

128
00:07:48,091 --> 00:07:49,581
Switch! Switch! Switch!

129
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,865
Hey. Thanks for stopping our ball.

130
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,007
You are playing American football?

131
00:08:05,174 --> 00:08:09,439
Yeah. Wow! You're, like,
from a whole other country!

132
00:08:10,045 --> 00:08:11,103
I'm Dutch.

133
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,543
Hi, I'm Joey.

134
00:08:13,715 --> 00:08:14,977
I am Margha.

135
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,776
I'm sorry, Dutch.
I didn't get that last little bit.

136
00:08:18,954 --> 00:08:21,581
Hey, Joey, you wanna play
football or... Hi, I'm Chandler.

137
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:23,588
Hello, Chandler.

138
00:08:23,858 --> 00:08:27,487
Her name is Dutch and also Margha.

139
00:08:27,862 --> 00:08:28,851
Margha.

140
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:31,293
- Margha.
- Margha.

141
00:08:31,832 --> 00:08:34,096
Mar-hon.

142
00:08:35,335 --> 00:08:36,324
Margha.

143
00:08:36,503 --> 00:08:40,633
Yo, flirty boys.
We're in the middle of a game.

144
00:08:40,807 --> 00:08:43,298
Come on, guys! Let's go!
Come on. Second down!

145
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,304
- Hello? It's third down.
- No, it's not. It's second.

146
00:08:48,414 --> 00:08:50,438
- Wow.
- Wow what?

147
00:08:50,716 --> 00:08:54,618
How it just amazes me
that you're still pulling stuff like this.

148
00:08:55,153 --> 00:08:58,987
- Pulling what? It's second down.
- Okay, it's second down.

149
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,586
Take all the second downs you need.

150
00:09:02,427 --> 00:09:05,088
- I heard that.
- Well, I said it loud.

151
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:09,161
It is okay if I stay and watch?

152
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,823
I can't go home just yet.

153
00:09:11,002 --> 00:09:16,440
My roommate is forshlocking
a big American businessman.

154
00:09:17,608 --> 00:09:20,633
- Just sit right there.
- Yeah, why don't you stick around?

155
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,437
- Well, that went well.
- I think so.

156
00:09:22,712 --> 00:09:25,613
You know, I was thinking
about asking her for her number.

157
00:09:25,882 --> 00:09:30,615
Thanks, man, but it makes a stronger
statement if I ask for it myself, you know?

158
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,478
No. I was thinking about for me.

159
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:36,648
As part of that whole getting-over-Janice
thing you talked about.

160
00:09:37,293 --> 00:09:38,590
Oh, yeah. That.

161
00:09:39,562 --> 00:09:41,621
If it means that much,
I'll let you have her.

162
00:09:41,797 --> 00:09:43,492
Thanks.

163
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:46,561
Let me have her?

164
00:09:46,735 --> 00:09:49,328
What do you mean?
If you didn't, I wouldn't have a shot?

165
00:09:49,904 --> 00:09:52,429
I don't like to say it out loud...

166
00:09:53,107 --> 00:09:54,131
...but yeah!

167
00:09:55,343 --> 00:09:57,607
Don't feel bad, man.
We all have our strengths.

168
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:02,409
- You're better with numbers and stuff.
- Math? You're giving me math?

169
00:10:03,685 --> 00:10:05,811
All right, you know what?
Forget about it.

170
00:10:06,086 --> 00:10:08,452
You go for the girl.
We'll see who gets her.

171
00:10:12,426 --> 00:10:15,759
Chandler, I want you to run
a post-pattern to the left. And, sweetie...

172
00:10:15,996 --> 00:10:17,190
Yeah, I know. Go long.

173
00:10:17,464 --> 00:10:21,126
You know, it's like all I'm doing is
running back and forth from the huddle.

174
00:10:21,767 --> 00:10:25,362
Well, you wanna just stay out there?

175
00:10:26,238 --> 00:10:28,365
Can I see that for a second?

176
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:33,374
- Okay.
- Okay, let's go.

177
00:10:33,613 --> 00:10:34,840
- I got Chandler!
- Hike!

178
00:10:35,113 --> 00:10:38,014
One Mississippi, two Mississippi,
three Mississippi.

179
00:10:38,216 --> 00:10:39,478
Fumble!

180
00:10:45,457 --> 00:10:48,392
What the hell's the matter with you?
This is my favorite jersey.

181
00:10:49,126 --> 00:10:51,356
Well, now you have two.

182
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:55,190
Hey, I am good at math!

183
00:10:55,366 --> 00:10:57,561
That's it. I was still
gonna let you have her.

184
00:10:57,735 --> 00:11:00,533
But now forget about it.
Prepare to feel bad about yourself.

185
00:11:00,704 --> 00:11:04,070
Hey, well, I've been preparing
for that my entire life!

186
00:11:04,774 --> 00:11:06,935
Or something about you that's mean!

187
00:11:07,577 --> 00:11:09,340
All right. Come on, guys. Let's go.

188
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:11,376
Tie score.
We're running out of time.

189
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:13,974
Forty-two, 38, hike!

190
00:11:14,183 --> 00:11:15,207
I got it!

191
00:11:16,252 --> 00:11:18,947
Oh, broken boobs!

192
00:11:19,588 --> 00:11:21,488
- Pheebs, run!
- Run, Phoebe, run!

193
00:11:22,491 --> 00:11:24,254
Touchdown! Touchdown!

194
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:30,592
Hello, the buzzer buzzed.
It doesn't count.

195
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:32,761
- After the snap.
- Before the snap.

196
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,261
- After.
- Before.

197
00:11:34,535 --> 00:11:36,230
- Now, does it really matter?
- Yes!

198
00:11:36,504 --> 00:11:40,031
But I made a touchdown.
It was my first touchdown.

199
00:11:40,207 --> 00:11:42,675
Pheebs, that's great.
Doesn't count.

200
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:45,774
- Does so count.
- Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.

201
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:50,014
Oh, my God!

202
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:54,417
You know what? That's fine.
Maybe you haven't grown up, but I have.

203
00:11:54,587 --> 00:11:57,715
- Oh, okay.
- Dead leg!

204
00:11:58,558 --> 00:12:01,925
Okay, fine. You want to win
by cheating, go ahead, all right.

205
00:12:02,095 --> 00:12:04,153
Phoebe, the touchdown
does count. You win.

206
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,622
No!

207
00:12:07,499 --> 00:12:09,558
I'm not going
to go through this again.

208
00:12:09,735 --> 00:12:11,669
I wanna beat you
when you can't blame...

209
00:12:11,837 --> 00:12:15,466
...it on the broken nose or the buzzer
or the fact that you might have mono.

210
00:12:16,075 --> 00:12:19,100
All right. Let's just call
this tie score and it's halftime.

211
00:12:19,277 --> 00:12:20,972
First, I don't play with cheaters.

212
00:12:21,145 --> 00:12:24,046
And second of all,
you know I had swollen glands!

213
00:12:26,017 --> 00:12:28,349
You know what? I think you'll play.

214
00:12:29,153 --> 00:12:30,745
Oh, really? Why's that?

215
00:12:30,922 --> 00:12:32,786
Because the winner gets this.

216
00:12:32,956 --> 00:12:35,584
The Geller Cup!

217
00:12:38,028 --> 00:12:42,522
Is everybody else seeing a
troll doll nailed to a two-by-four?

218
00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:44,792
Okay, good.

219
00:12:47,837 --> 00:12:49,668
Okay, where the hell did you get that?

220
00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:52,169
When you went to the hospital
for your nose...

221
00:12:52,475 --> 00:12:55,273
...I swam into the lake
and fished it out.

222
00:12:55,478 --> 00:12:56,502
That cup is mine!

223
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:59,910
No, it's not. You want it,
you're gonna have to win it.

224
00:13:00,116 --> 00:13:03,209
All right. So are we not
having dinner at all?

225
00:13:03,885 --> 00:13:06,445
Hey, could you please
set the timer, Margha?

226
00:13:06,621 --> 00:13:08,555
Okay, Beefy.

227
00:13:11,426 --> 00:13:15,294
Come on, Phoebe, let's go. Come on,
it's time to get serious. Huddle up.

228
00:13:15,663 --> 00:13:17,493
Joey, keep your head in the game.

229
00:13:17,765 --> 00:13:21,132
It's hard, you know?
His huddle's close to the Dutch girl.

230
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:26,098
Look, if I take Chandler out of the
running, will you be able to focus?

231
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:29,071
- What are you gonna do?
- Just make sure he catches the ball.

232
00:13:29,243 --> 00:13:30,403
- I'll do the rest.
- Okay.

233
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:33,277
- Come on, you wuss!
- Okay, come on.

234
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,144
- Go, Chan...
- I got it!

235
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,304
Come on! This way!

236
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,472
Hi!

237
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:39,774
Look out!

238
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,083
Tackled by a girl! Bet you don't
see that every day, do you?

239
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:50,760
What's with the tackling?

240
00:13:51,229 --> 00:13:52,218
What?

241
00:13:52,764 --> 00:13:54,664
I just touched him and he went over.

242
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:58,825
Okay. You wanna play rough?
We can play rough.

243
00:13:59,504 --> 00:14:01,937
Let's get ready to rumble!

244
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:44,074
- Go, go, go!
- Get her! Get her!

245
00:14:47,982 --> 00:14:49,711
I love this game!

246
00:14:52,753 --> 00:14:54,050
Hey, where'd you get that?

247
00:14:54,789 --> 00:14:56,654
I went really long.

248
00:14:57,992 --> 00:14:59,857
Forty-two to 21.

249
00:15:00,027 --> 00:15:03,120
Like the turkey, Ross is done!

250
00:15:04,097 --> 00:15:07,294
No surprise. You got to pick first,
so you got the better team.

251
00:15:07,467 --> 00:15:10,402
You're pathetic! Why can't you
just accept that we're winning...

252
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,003
...because I'm better than you?

253
00:15:12,672 --> 00:15:16,072
Oh, what a great argument.
Exhaling!

254
00:15:16,742 --> 00:15:18,573
You know what? I'll prove it to you.

255
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:22,639
I'll trade you Joey for Rachel
and I'll still win the game.

256
00:15:22,815 --> 00:15:26,376
Oh, that's great.
There goes my last shred of self-esteem.

257
00:15:26,685 --> 00:15:30,017
What? The guys against the girls?

258
00:15:30,188 --> 00:15:33,783
See that's ridiculous, Monica, because
I'm only down by three touchdowns.

259
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,619
Oh, then bring it on!

260
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,125
Unless, of course, you're afraid
you might lose to a bunch of girls.

261
00:15:41,366 --> 00:15:44,766
Fine. Fine. Rachel, you're with Monica.
Joey, you're with me.

262
00:15:45,035 --> 00:15:47,765
I cannot believe you are trading me.

263
00:15:47,938 --> 00:15:49,701
You are going to lose.

264
00:15:49,873 --> 00:15:52,535
And you are going to lose.

265
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:54,108
And...

266
00:15:54,278 --> 00:15:56,246
Help me out.
I've never done this before.

267
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,402
That's good. Lose.

268
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:58,775
Lose!

269
00:16:00,249 --> 00:16:03,650
Come on. Let's see what it's like
to be on a winning team for a change.

270
00:16:03,819 --> 00:16:05,480
You're gonna let me play?

271
00:16:05,922 --> 00:16:07,822
All right, then!

272
00:16:08,224 --> 00:16:10,055
The game is over? We eat now?

273
00:16:10,226 --> 00:16:12,217
The game's not over.
We're switching teams.

274
00:16:12,395 --> 00:16:16,660
Yeah. Chandler finds me so intimidating
that it's better if we're on the same team.

275
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:19,063
All right. Okay, let's play. Let's go.

276
00:16:19,234 --> 00:16:20,496
Hold on a second, Joe.

277
00:16:21,569 --> 00:16:23,230
Where do Dutch people come from?

278
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:36,072
Well, the Pennsylvania Dutch
come from Pennsylvania.

279
00:16:36,684 --> 00:16:38,709
And the other Dutch people?

280
00:16:38,986 --> 00:16:41,580
They come from somewhere near
the Netherlands, right?

281
00:16:41,755 --> 00:16:43,723
Nice try.

282
00:16:43,891 --> 00:16:46,290
See the Netherlands
is this make-believe place...

283
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:49,485
...where Peter Pan
and Tinker Bell come from.

284
00:16:50,396 --> 00:16:52,296
Oh, my.

285
00:16:52,465 --> 00:16:56,026
Enough with geography for
the insane, okay. Let's play some ball.

286
00:16:56,235 --> 00:16:59,670
- No. I'm not playing with this guy now.
- Fine with me.

287
00:16:59,838 --> 00:17:02,864
Okay, I've had enough of this.
Let's just cut to the chase.

288
00:17:03,108 --> 00:17:05,235
Heidi, which
of my boys do you like?

289
00:17:06,244 --> 00:17:07,233
What are you doing?

290
00:17:07,512 --> 00:17:09,742
What are you doing?

291
00:17:10,615 --> 00:17:12,242
Which do I like?

292
00:17:12,417 --> 00:17:16,284
Yeah, for dating, general merriment,
taking back to your windmill?

293
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:19,388
Well, if I had to choose right now...

294
00:17:19,557 --> 00:17:22,287
...which, by the way,
I find really weird...

295
00:17:23,694 --> 00:17:25,787
...I would have to say Chandler.

296
00:17:26,163 --> 00:17:27,994
Yes!

297
00:17:28,366 --> 00:17:31,698
Wait a minute. She obviously
didn't understand the question.

298
00:17:31,868 --> 00:17:35,133
Well, why don't you have
Captain Hook explain it to her?

299
00:17:36,406 --> 00:17:38,431
I'm sorry, Joey. That is my truth.

300
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:42,235
You hear that? That is her truth,
Mr. I'll-Let-You-Have-Her!

301
00:17:42,412 --> 00:17:45,141
I win! You suck! I rule all!

302
00:17:45,414 --> 00:17:47,473
Mini-wave in celebration of me!

303
00:17:51,887 --> 00:17:56,950
I am now thinking I would like
to change my answer to no one.

304
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,323
What?

305
00:17:59,494 --> 00:18:01,894
I now find you shallow...

306
00:18:02,163 --> 00:18:04,290
...and a dork.

307
00:18:04,465 --> 00:18:06,228
Bye-bye.

308
00:18:07,301 --> 00:18:10,828
Nice going. You just saved
yourself a couple months of sex.

309
00:18:11,739 --> 00:18:14,832
You know what? It doesn't matter,
because she picked me. Me!

310
00:18:15,008 --> 00:18:16,100
Now I get the dates...

311
00:18:16,276 --> 00:18:20,076
...and you stay home on Saturday
nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!

312
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,444
Save the breakthroughs for therapy.
The clock is ticking.

313
00:18:23,683 --> 00:18:26,379
We have no time
and we are losing to girls.

314
00:18:26,553 --> 00:18:28,179
We're not gonna lose to girls.

315
00:18:28,354 --> 00:18:29,787
It's 42 to 21!

316
00:18:30,022 --> 00:18:33,719
This sucks!
I was just up by that much!

317
00:18:35,227 --> 00:18:36,717
Look, let me put it this way.

318
00:18:36,896 --> 00:18:39,330
If we lose, they will never let us forget it.

319
00:18:39,498 --> 00:18:43,433
Okay, and worse than that, they'll never
let the women you date forget it.

320
00:18:43,601 --> 00:18:46,934
Hey! Are we playing football, or what?
Come on, you hairy-backed Marys!

321
00:18:48,773 --> 00:18:51,867
We have to do this.
We are playing for women everywhere.

322
00:18:52,043 --> 00:18:54,603
Okay, just think about
every lousy date you ever had.

323
00:18:54,879 --> 00:18:57,779
Every guy who kept one eye
on the TV while you were making out.

324
00:18:57,948 --> 00:19:01,179
Oh, my God! You dated
someone with a glass eye too?

325
00:19:02,786 --> 00:19:06,984
Come on, okay? This is for
all womankind. Let's kill them!

326
00:19:07,157 --> 00:19:09,352
Yeah! Kill them!

327
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,425
All right, well,
I want to kill them too.

328
00:19:12,595 --> 00:19:13,960
But they're boys.

329
00:19:14,397 --> 00:19:17,764
You know, how are we gonna
beat three boys?

330
00:19:46,827 --> 00:19:50,160
We still have a minute and a half
left, and we're down by two points.

331
00:19:50,331 --> 00:19:51,628
Two points, ladies.

332
00:19:57,036 --> 00:19:59,266
Phoebe, you do a buttonhook again.

333
00:19:59,506 --> 00:20:00,939
Rachel, you go long.

334
00:20:01,107 --> 00:20:04,838
No, don't make me go long.
Use me. They never cover me.

335
00:20:05,011 --> 00:20:06,774
Honey, there's a reason.

336
00:20:08,047 --> 00:20:11,380
Monica, I'm not lame, okay?
I can do something. I can throw.

337
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:15,316
- Let me throw. This is my game too.
- Come on, Mon. Let her throw the ball.

338
00:20:15,521 --> 00:20:19,252
Rachel, sweep behind, I'll pitch it to you.
You throw it downfield to Phoebe.

339
00:20:19,424 --> 00:20:20,413
Thank you.

340
00:20:20,592 --> 00:20:21,581
- Break!
- Break!

341
00:20:21,994 --> 00:20:23,791
- All right, here we go.
- Okay.

342
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:26,360
Thirty-two, 71, hike!

343
00:20:26,564 --> 00:20:29,124
One Mississippi, two Mississippi,
three Mississippi!

344
00:20:34,372 --> 00:20:35,896
Go, go, go!

345
00:20:36,674 --> 00:20:38,835
Mon, catch!

346
00:20:40,344 --> 00:20:43,870
- I'm so sorry. Are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay!

347
00:20:44,781 --> 00:20:47,682
I'm sorry. They were coming at me
and I didn't know what to do.

348
00:20:47,851 --> 00:20:49,910
Thirty seconds left on the timer.

349
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,651
You are the loser!

350
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:58,449
Okay, okay. So we get
to take that stupid troll thing home.

351
00:20:58,627 --> 00:21:01,596
Come on! Come on! Hurry!
We're running out of time.

352
00:21:01,764 --> 00:21:04,426
- Huddle up!
- Okay.

353
00:21:05,768 --> 00:21:07,736
Oh, this is our last huddle!

354
00:21:08,637 --> 00:21:11,537
All right, Phoebe, get open.
Rachel...

355
00:21:11,706 --> 00:21:12,695
...go long.

356
00:21:12,874 --> 00:21:14,205
Okay.

357
00:21:14,442 --> 00:21:16,307
Break!

358
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:06,186
I did it! Touchdown!
We did it!

359
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:14,094
You know? Rachel, funny thing, actually.
The end zone starts at that pole.

360
00:22:14,331 --> 00:22:16,356
So you're 5 feet short.
So...

361
00:22:17,368 --> 00:22:19,268
...we win!

362
00:22:20,471 --> 00:22:21,995
Yes, yes, yes!

363
00:22:22,172 --> 00:22:24,163
Wait, so explain
something to me, though.

364
00:22:24,441 --> 00:22:28,638
If nobody tagged Rachel,
then isn't the play still going?

365
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:36,407
- Let me in, let me in!
- No way! Let go!

366
00:22:36,586 --> 00:22:39,850
Let go?! I'm a tiny little woman!

367
00:22:40,022 --> 00:22:44,322
Guys, guys, come on. It's Thanksgiving!
It's not important who wins or loses.

368
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,687
The important thing
is, the Dutch girl picked me!

369
00:22:49,464 --> 00:22:53,833
Me, not you! Holland loves Chandler!
Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!

370
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,633
We should definitely
play football more often.

371
00:23:01,809 --> 00:23:04,676
Maybe there's, like, a league
we could join or something.

372
00:23:04,845 --> 00:23:07,746
Isn't there, like,
a national football league?

373
00:23:08,616 --> 00:23:11,448
Yes. Yes, there is. They play
on Sundays and Monday nights.

374
00:23:11,618 --> 00:23:14,212
Oh, shoot! I work Monday nights.

375
00:23:16,823 --> 00:23:19,348
This stuffing is amazing.

376
00:23:19,526 --> 00:23:23,018
- Should we should bring them some?
- When they're hungry, they'll come in.

377
00:23:23,196 --> 00:23:26,096
- Let go!
- No, you let go!

378
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,969
How come it's always us
left on the field, holding the ball?

379
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:35,570
I don't know. I guess the other
people just don't care enough.

380
00:23:40,678 --> 00:23:44,239
Hey, it's starting to snow.

381
00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:51,716
- Give it to me! Let go!
- Let it go! Come on!

382
00:23:55,792 --> 00:23:59,023
There was a time tonight that
I started losing the feeling in my toes.

383
00:23:59,196 --> 00:24:01,130
- I know.
- That's when I realized...

384
00:24:01,298 --> 00:24:04,461
...there's more important things
than beating you at football.

385
00:24:04,634 --> 00:24:06,431
Things like feet.

386
00:24:06,603 --> 00:24:10,231
Yeah, I know. This thing has
caused us too much pain and suffering.

387
00:24:10,406 --> 00:24:12,033
- Yeah.
- It's time.

388
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:13,903
We'll just call it a tie.

389
00:24:14,076 --> 00:24:16,306
- It's a tie.
- All right.

390
00:24:16,479 --> 00:24:17,468
Here.

391
00:24:18,814 --> 00:24:20,145
Okay.

392
00:24:24,452 --> 00:24:27,285
- Good night.
- Good night.

393
00:24:29,624 --> 00:24:30,852
Pheebs, did you get it?

394
00:24:31,025 --> 00:24:33,255
- Yeah, I got it.
- Oh, great.

395
00:24:33,428 --> 00:24:38,126
Bring it up. There's champagne
in my apartment for the winners.

396
00:24:38,298 --> 00:24:41,734
- Ross! What are you doing down here?
- Nothing.

397
00:24:45,406 --> 00:24:46,395
