1
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,720
“前情提要” 我觉得自己好像没有女朋友
-Previously on Friends.... -I don't feel like I have a girlfriend.

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,930
你是不是要我辞职 好让你觉得自己有女朋友？
You want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,030
这又是为了马克吗？ 我的老天爷
-ls this about Mark? -Oh,my God.

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,570
好，不是 我的老天爷
-Okay,it's not. -Oh,my God.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,940
我不能老是跟你 为同一件事情吵架
I cannot keep having this fight with you!

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,410
也许我们应该冷静一下
Maybe we should just take a break.

7
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,640
很好，你说得对 我们冷静一下
Fine. You're right. Let's take a break.

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,820
我们去吃冷冻酸奶
Let's get some frozen yogurt or something.

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,750
我们分手吧
A break from us.

10
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,520
然后我们大吵一架，弄得很僵 我告诉他我想冷静一下
Then we had this big fight,and I said I wanted to take a break.

11
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,520
我不想分开
I don't want to take a break.

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,820
这太荒谬了
This is crazy.

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,760
我们不能沟通吗？
Can't we work on this?

14
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,030
你想喝什么？
What do you want to drink?

15
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:40,400
那是谁？
Who's that?

16
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:42,930
没有人
Nobody.

17
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:44,770
那是马克吗？
Is that Mark?

18
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:46,170
亲爱的，他只是过来…
Honey,look,he just

19
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:47,740
好，我懂了
Yeah. Got it!

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,210
来跳舞吧 你结婚了吗？
Hey,come dance. What,are you married?

21
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,180
也无所谓
Because that's okay.

22
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,190
“第二天早上”

23
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,690
昨晚的 周年纪念日大餐怎么样？
How was the big anniversary dinner?

24
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,300
我们根本没机会吃晚餐
Well,we never actually got to dinner.

25
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:17,870
很好
Nice.

26
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,700
我们分手了
We kind of broke up instead.

27
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:22,880
什么？
What?

28
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,570
我的天，喷到天花板了
My God! It's on the ceiling!

29
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:29,780
没关系
That's okay.

30
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,110
这件事的重要性超过…
This is more important than fruit...

31
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,920
天花板上的水果
...on my ceiling.

32
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,450
你们分手了？
You broke up?

33
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,890
对，不过没关系 罗斯走了以后，马克来了
Yeah,but it's okay because when Ross left,Mark came over.

34
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,620
不会吧，你跟马克？ 没关系，别紧张
-Oh,no! You and Mark? -It's okay. Calm down.

35
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,330
马克跟我聊了很久
Mark and I talked...

36
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,760
我了解自己有多爱你的蠢大哥
...and I realized how much I love your stupid brother.

37
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:53,470
我们有问题，但我真心 想跟他继续交往下去
We got our problems,but I really wanna make it work.

38
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:11,950
早安
Morning!

39
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,600
本集播出：“第二天早上”
The One the Morning After

40
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,950
是我，我找了你一整夜 我好难过
It's me. I've been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful.

41
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,210
我跟马克没有什么
There's nothing between me and Mark.

42
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,890
我们分手这事真是太愚蠢了 对
This whole breakup thing is just stupid.

43
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,230
我这样折磨你，真对不起
I'm sorry I put you through it.

44
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,960
我不想用答录机和好
And I don't want to get back together over a machine.

45
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,060
我爱你
So I love you.

46
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,100
我爱你
I love you.

47
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,710
跟你说，我要睡了
And you know what? I'm gonna go to bed now...

48
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:38,580
但我明天早上上班的时候 八点半过来，再见
...but on my way to work tomorrow,I'll stop by around 8:30. Bye.

49
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,150
克萝伊，你好了没有？
Chloe,how's it coming?

50
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,820
你觉得我应该买什么样的狗？
What kind of puppy do you think I should get?

51
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,020
买只大狗怎么样？
Well,how about a big one?

52
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,820
可是我的公寓… 那买小狗好了
-But my apartment's so -Then a small one.

53
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,460
我们该走了 等等，我的鞋子呢？
-We have to go. -Wait! Where's my shoes?

54
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,720
你要穿鞋子？
You need shoes?

55
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:01,930
我们干嘛这么赶？ 我不是跟你提过我女友吗？
-Do I know why we're rushing? -You know my girlfriend?

56
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,200
结果她想跟我复合
It turns out that she wants to get back together.

57
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,410
找到了
I found it!

58
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,740
那真是太好了
That's so great for you guys!

59
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,310
你一定很高兴
You must be so happy!

60
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,380
对，我是觉得很高兴
Yes,I am. One of the many things I'm feeling.

61
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:18,450
祝你们好运 谢谢
-Good luck with your girlfriend. -Thank you.

62
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,760
你听到我的留言没有？ 你真准时
-You got my message? -You are right on time!

63
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,400
我可以再当你的女朋友吗？
So can I be your girlfriend again?

64
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,140
当然可以，这样最好了
Yes,you can. Very much.

65
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,270
你干嘛拖天花板？ 上面有香蕉
-Why are you mopping your ceiling? -There's banana on it.

66
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,810
有个印第安老女人的灵魂 住在我家客厅里
I have the spirit of an old lndian woman living in mine.

67
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,140
那你知道
So,then,you know.

68
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,650
邮差来过了 我帮你把邮件拿上来
The mailman was here,so I brought your mail.

69
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,060
很好，谢谢 那是法布科技的东西吗？
-Oh,good. Thanks. -Now,what is Fabutech?

70
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,330
不要看不起我，好吗？
Don't judge me too much,okay?

71
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,970
我看到这个 我发誓我从来没有…
I saw this infomercial,and I swear I have never...

72
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,400
买过购物频道的东西
... bought anything on TV before.

73
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,440
除了这只拖把以外
Except for this mop.

74
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,650
不过这个刮腿毛膏很棒
But there was this amazing stuff on leg-waxing

75
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:18,810
刮刮看！
Waxine!

76
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,410
对，你看过？
Yes! Have you seen it?

77
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,170
这太棒了 我早就想当刮刮看女O
It's incredible! I want to be a Waxine Girl!

78
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:24,680
我知道
I know!

79
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:29,460
你觉得这真的不会痛吗？ 怎么会不痛的呢？
Do you think it really doesn't hurt? How can they do that?

80
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:33,130
嗨，最近才在雨林 发现的有机物质？
Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the rain forest?

81
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,030
里面都是上等货
They have the best stuff in there.

82
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,730
我的天
Oh,my God!

83
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,570
我的天
Oh,my God!

84
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:46,500
我们找不到你 还以为你去跟瑞秋和好了
We figured when we couldn't find you,you'd gone to make up with Rachel.

85
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,900
其实应该这样才对
Which is probably what you should have done.

86
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,340
你说呢？
You think?

87
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:56,420
我完蛋了，我该怎么办？
God,I'm in hell. I mean,what am I gonna do?

88
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:00,710
瑞秋满口说着“我爱你” 而我脑子里只想着…
Rachel's all "I love you," and all I can think about...

89
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,820
如果我把实情告诉她 她会怎么样？
...is what is she gonna do when I tell her what I did?

90
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:07,790
首先，我们应该谈 比较重要的问题
First,we should address the more important question...

91
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,400
你到底有多蠢？
...how dumb are you?

92
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:15,400
我们努力想恢复 这份感情，好吗？
Look,we're trying to rebuild a relationship here,right?

93
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:18,230
如果不诚实，还谈什么感情？
How can I do that without being honest?

94
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,740
我也赞成要坦承，真的
I'm onboard about the total-honesty thing. I am.

95
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,540
不过会惹麻烦的事 还是少说为妙
Just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble.

96
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,080
他说的对，这对谁都没好处 只会让你伤害她
He's right. Nobody benefits,and you'll just hurt her.

97
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:32,180
到时候感情也没了
And there won't be a relationship left to rebuild.

98
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,290
你不觉得…
Don't you think

99
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,050
如果你非说不可 至少先等适当的时机再说
If you have to tell her,at least wait till the timing's right.

100
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,250
所以临终之前才要忏悔
And that's what deathbeds are for.

101
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,220
好吧 好
-Yeah,okay. -All right.

102
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:49,600
好，我们必须确定 她不会从其他渠道知道
Okay. Now,we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way.

103
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,040
你觉得有没有串连？
Did you think about the trail?

104
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,980
什么串连？
What trail?

105
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,110
从跟你做这件事的女人
From the woman you did it with...

106
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,650
到你千方百计要隐瞒的女人
...to the woman you hope never finds out you did it!

107
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,320
永远不要忘了中间的串连
Always think about the trail!

108
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,560
我想应该没有任何串连
I don't think there's any trail.

109
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,760
克萝伊的同事艾塞克…
Chloe works with that guy,lsaac.

110
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,090
艾塞克的妹妹洁丝敏 是菲比在按摩中心的同事
Isaac's sister is Jasmine,who works at the massage place with Phoebe.

111
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,290
菲比是瑞秋的朋友 这就是串连，我找到了
Phoebe is Rachel's friend,and that's the trail! I did it!

112
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:28,140
把刮腿毛膏和麻布条 帖在腿毛上
"After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg"

113
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,470
好了
Did that!

114
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:33,080
抓住突出的布条
"Grasp the linen strip by its tab...

115
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,250
瞬间扯下来，完全无痛
...and pull it off in one quick,pain-free motion."

116
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:42,250
这不是无痛的吗？
Was it not "pain-free"?

117
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,420
不，痛死了
No,it was pain-ful!

118
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,220
我的天，这应该叫痛痛膏 加一点腿毛膏
My God,they should call it "Pain-zine,now with a little wax."

119
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,730
广告上的女孩 好像不觉得有这么痛
The girls on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad.

120
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:58,060
那是因为她们太笨 所以神经都死掉了
Because their nerves are deadened from being so stupid.

121
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:04,010
如果你不相信我的话 尽管自己试试看
But you know,if you don't believe me,please,be my guest.

122
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,850
这下你该庆幸我们没有贴比基尼布条了吧？
Now are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips?

123
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,820
克萝伊，嗨
Chloe,hi.

124
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,920
是为了我拿走你的手表吗？
Is this about me taking your watch?

125
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,090
你拿了我的手表？ 对不起，我有这种习惯
-You took my watch? -I'm sorry. I do that.

126
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,430
你留着吧，听我说 你把我们的事跟别人说了吗？
You keep it. Listen,did you tell anyone about us?

127
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:33,800
没有，我觉得不关别人的事
I feel like it really isn't anybody's business.

128
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,140
没错，那你没有 告诉艾塞克？
Exactly. So you didn't mention anything to lsaac?

129
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,110
我什么事都告诉艾塞克 真的？那当然啦
-I tell lsaac everything. -You do? Of course you do.

130
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,480
嗨，艾塞克 我们还没有正式见过面
Hi,lsaac. You know,we haven't actually met.

131
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,310
你这只发情的小狗
You dog!

132
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,560
对，我想我是一只小狗 不过我有个女朋友
Yes,I suppose I am a dog. But see,I happen to have a girlfriend.

133
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,990
对，咖啡厅的瑞秋
Right. Rachel from the coffee place.

134
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,030
就是她 我不想伤害她
That's the one. Listen,I don't want to hurt her.

135
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,000
我知道 不管我们有多爱她们
I know. It doesn't matter how much we love them.

136
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,800
一夫一妻制是违反人性的
Monogamy is too cruel a rule.

137
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,140
听我说 可以替我保守秘密吗？
Listen,can you keep this information to yourself?

138
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,750
没问题 我们要互相关照才行
No problem. We gotta look out for each other.

139
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,750
你跟我是一样的
We're the same,you and me.

140
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,480
其实我们是不一样的
Actually,no,we're not.

141
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,060
一样的
Yeah,we are.

142
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,420
不一样
No,we're not.

143
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,030
一样
Yeah,we are.

144
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,320
不一样
No,we're not.

145
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,900
好，不一样 对
-Okay,we're not. -Right.

146
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,030
不过我们是一样的
But we are.

147
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,280
好，我只想知道 你不会告诉你妹妹
Fine. I just need to know that you won't tell your sister.

148
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,440
我可以保证不会跟她说第二次
I can promise not to tell her again.

149
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:52,680
洁丝敏？我们在菲比的 生日派对见过，我是罗斯
Jasmine? We met at Phoebe's birthday party. I'm Ross Geller.

150
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,190
你做了一件坏事
You did a bad thing!

151
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,030
没错 坏透了
-Yes,I did. -Very bad!

152
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,130
坏透了 不可原谅
-Very bad. -Very,very bad!

153
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,420
我完全同意你的话
I'm agreeing with you.

154
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:05,190
听我说，你告诉菲比没有？
Listen,did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?

155
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:10,400
拜托你不要说
Please. Please don't.

156
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,100
我很爱我的女朋友 希望跟她继续交往
I love my girlfriend very much and I want to work it out with her.

157
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,140
好吧
All right.

158
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,310
谢谢你…
Thank you. Thank you.

159
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,580
不过你应该去找我的室友 我跟他说了，他也认识菲比
But you should talk to my roommate. I told him,and he knows Phoebe too.

160
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,280
你的室友是谁？
Who's your roommate?

161
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:34,160
甘瑟，告诉我你没有告诉瑞秋 我跟影印店那女孩的事
Gunther，Tell me you didn't tell Rachel about me and the girl from the copy place.

162
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,060
对不起
I'm sorry.

163
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,100
难道我不该说？
Was I not supposed to?

164
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:55,620
好吧，我有个主意，咱们何不交换着揭呢
Okay, l got an idea. Why don't you pull off mine, and l pull off yours?

165
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,090
或者你揭你的，我的就留着吧
Or, you pull of yours,and l will leave mine on...

166
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,980
因为我觉得我这样不耽误工作
...because l think l can make this look work.

167
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,880
拜托，菲比，我们能办到的
Come on, Phoebe. We can do this.

168
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,750
-好吧 -好吧
-All right -All right.

169
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,090
好
Okay.

170
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,840
-怎么了 -出什么事了
-What is it -What's going on?

171
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,170
我们没事 不要紧…
-We're all right. -It's okay. It's okay.

172
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,740
我们只是在刮腿 把腿刮掉？
-We were just waxing our legs. -Off?

173
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:29,080
告诉你们，男人永远 不会经历这种痛苦
For your information,this is a pain like no man will ever experience.

174
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:32,050
你最好不要说这种话 除非你的重要部位…
Unless you've been kicked in an area...

175
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,050
曾经被狠狠踢过
...that God only meant to be treated nicely.

176
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:40,060
只不过女人的门槛 比男人低罢了
Women just have a lower threshold for pain than men,that's all.

177
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,890
拜托，只不过是一点腿毛膏
I mean,come on,it's just a little wax.

178
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,760
是吗？过来
Oh,yeah? Come here.

179
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,340
哦，真成熟
Oh,that's mature.

180
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,940
现在撕掉就好了吗？
So now I just pull it off?

181
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,210
没错
That's right.

182
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,980
好吧，铁皮人（《绿野仙踪》中的机器人）
Okay, Tin Man.

183
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,820
瑞秋，拜托你跟我说话
Rachel, come on.Just talk to me. Please!

184
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:14,090
跟你说话？ 我连看都不想看你一眼
Talk to you? I can't even look at you right now.

185
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,860
没事…
Nothing. Nothing.

186
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,600
她之前说没事的 他们在说些什么？
-She said it was okay. -What are they talking about?

187
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:25,400
你滚远一点 我犯错了，好吗？
-Just get away from me! -I made a mistake,okay?

188
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,640
错误？你放到哪里去了？ 她的皮包里？
A mistake? What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?

189
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,110
他放到哪里了？
Where did he put it?

190
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,520
你跟另外一个女人上床
You had sex with another woman!

191
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,750
我的天
Oh,my God!

192
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:46,420
我早就知道有事 我的指甲昨天一点都没长长
I knew something was wrong because my nails didn't grow at all yesterday.

193
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,800
我想是他们吵了一架 他喝醉了…
I guess they had a fight,and he got drunk

194
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,830
你们男生早就知道 却没跟我们说？
You guys knew about this and didn't tell us?

195
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,530
他做爱了，我们却要挨打
He has sex and we get hit in our heads!

196
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,540
我要你马上离开，滚出去
I want you to leave! Just get out! Now!

197
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,670
我要留下来好好谈这件事
I want to stay and talk about this.

198
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,840
好，她怎么样？
All right. How was she?

199
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,980
什么？ 她好不好？
-What? -Was she good?

200
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,210
不要回答
Don't answer that.

201
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:20,020
你说要好好谈谈 我们就来谈，她怎么样？
You said you wanted to talk about it. Let's talk. How was she?

202
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,860
她很… 逊
-She was.... -Awful.

203
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:26,190
不怎么样 烂透了，跟你没得比
-She was not good. -Horrible. Nothing compared to you.

204
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,130
她不一样
She was different.

205
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,870
好的不一样？
Good different?

206
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,180
没有人喜欢改变
Nobody likes change.

207
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,840
够了 什么？好…
-Just stop! -What? Okay! Okay! Okay!

208
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,880
我们该做些什么吗？
Should we do something?

209
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,350
对，永远不要欺骗瑞秋
Yeah. Never cheat on Rachel.

210
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,250
对不起，好吗？我很抱歉 我当时很受不了我自己
I'm sorry,okay? I'm sorry. I was disgusted with myself...

211
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,020
今天早上，我很难过
...and this morning I was upset...

212
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,850
然后收到你的留言 我好高兴
...and then I got your message and I was so happy.

213
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:59,090
我一心只想把她 赶出我的公寓…
And all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment

214
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,270
等一下
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Wait a minute.

215
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,500
你的小朋友是几点离开的？
What time did your little friend leave?

216
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,280
我的天，她在？ 她那时还在你家？
Oh,my God. She was there? She was still there?

217
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:16,680
我在你家的时候她也在？
She was in there when I was in there?

218
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,260
听我说，重点是 她对我毫无意义
Listen,the important thing is she meant nothing to me.

219
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,120
却值得你为她破坏我们的关系
And yet she was worth jeopardizing our relationship!

220
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,890
那时候我不知道 我们还有关系
I didn't think there was a relationship.

221
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,470
我们分手了 只是暂时冷静一下
-We'd broken up. -We were on a break.

222
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,230
对我来说，那可能是一辈子 那就是分手
That,for all I knew,could last forever. That is a breakup.

223
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,200
你想用技术性细节逃掉吗？
You gonna get out of this on a technicality?

224
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,770
我不想逃掉什么
I'm not trying to "get out" of anything.

225
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,780
我以为我们的关系完了
I thought our relationship was dead.

226
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,940
你马上就去享艳福了
Well,you sure had a hell of a time at the wake.

227
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,810
我想我们不该再听下去了
I don't think we should listen to this anymore.

228
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,060
你干嘛？我们不能出去
What are you doing? We can't go out.

229
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,490
为什么不行？我饿了
Why not? I'm hungry.

230
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,590
因为他们会知道我们在偷听
Because they'll know we've been listening.

231
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:04,830
老天，我还得从 甘瑟那里听到这件事
God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!

232
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,900
我到处奔波 就是不想让你知道
I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!

233
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,070
你好体帖
Oh,that is so sweet.

234
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,580
我想我又重新爱上你了
I think I'm falling in love with you all over again.

235
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,420
我们可以出去了 他们有其他的事要担心
We can go out. They have other things to worry about.

236
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,750
不会有事的
We'll be fine.

237
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:28,410
瑞秋，我早就想告诉你 我觉得我应该告诉你
Rachel,I wanted to tell you. I thought I should.

238
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:32,320
但是钱德和乔伊叫我不要说
And then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to!

239
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,660
把门用腊封起来 我们再也不走了
Wax the door shut. We're never leaving.

240
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,040
我是菲比，瑞哈克先生九点来 得有人帮我代班
It's Phoebe. Someone has to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehak...

241
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:47,270
因为现在已经九点一刻 我人还没到
... because it's 9:15 now,and I'm not there.

242
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:53,200
不，我现在处于一个严重的关系斗争中，因此…
No, l'm in the middle of a huge relationship fight, so....

243
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,540
哦，没关系，不是我的事情
Oh, that's all right.lt's not mine.

244
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,620
之所以会发生这种事 都是因为…
None of this would've happened if I didn't think...

245
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,120
我以为那时候 你在跟马克上床
...you were having sex with Mark?

246
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,480
好
All right.

247
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:08,630
就说我跟马克上了床 你可以原谅我吗？
Let's say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?

248
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:12,860
我会的
Yes,I would.

249
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:19,700
你不介意马克吻我 跟我裸体相见
You'd be okay if Mark had kissed me,and been naked with me...

250
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,300
跟我做爱？
...and made love to me?

251
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:28,910
要是你知道我们火热 汗湿、翻滚的身体…
If you knew that our hot,sweaty,writhing bodies were

252
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,260
我会不知如何是好
I would have been devastated...

253
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,120
不过我还是想跟你在一起
... but I would still want to be with you.

254
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:43,060
因为，是你啊
Because,I mean,it's you.

255
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:57,570
说吧，告诉我你在想什么
Come on,tell me what you're thinking.

256
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,040
我想…
I'm thinking...

257
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,720
叫一个披萨
... I'm gonna order a pizza.

258
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,580
叫一个披萨，意思是…
Order a pizza,like...

259
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,420
“我原谅你”？
... "I forgive you"?

260
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,690
老天
Oh,man!

261
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:22,330
披萨？
Pizza?

262
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,090
我喜欢吃披萨
I like pizza.

263
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,000
披萨上面放橄榄
Put olives on the pizza.

264
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,380
我们可以吃腿毛膏 那是有机的
We could eat the wax! It's organic!

265
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,740
太好了，连毛一起吃下去
Oh,great. Food with hair on it.

266
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,280
不，我不是说用过的
No,not the used wax.

267
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,850
因为那样很神经？
Because that would be crazy?

268
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:52,660
可以算我一份吗？ 因为我也饿了
Could I get in on that? Because I'm kind of hungry myself.

269
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:53,920
好
Fine.

270
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:56,930
我想要一份大号的披萨
Yes,I'd like to order a large pizza.

271
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,500
不要放沙丁鱼 多加一份沙丁鱼
-No anchovies. -With extra anchovies.

272
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,840
没关系，我挑掉就好了
That's okay. I'll pick them off.

273
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,380
麻烦你把沙丁鱼剁碎了 搅到酱汁里好吗？
And could you chop some up and put it right in the sauce?

274
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,210
你想吃的话，最后一块给你
You can have the last piece if you want.

275
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:18,290
应该的，你跟别人上床了
Well,I should think so. You slept with someone.

276
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,430
他们应该会和好吧？
They're gonna get through this,aren't they?

277
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,600
当然啦，他们是罗斯跟瑞秋呢
Yeah. Come on,it's Ross and Rachel.

278
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,810
他们非和好不可
They've got to.

279
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,140
万一他们不能和好呢？
What if they don't?

280
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,850
你们觉得 我需要新的走路姿势吗？
You think I need a new walk?

281
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,090
什么？
What?

282
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,160
我从高中开始 走路的姿势都一样
Well,I've been walking the same way since high school.

283
00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:00,330
你知道有些人不管到哪里都会吸引所有人的目光吗？
You know how some guys walk into a room and everybody takes notice?

284
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,530
我想我需要 吸引目光的走路姿势
I think I need a take-notice walk.

285
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,630
你是说了这些话吗？
Are you actually saying these words?

286
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,040
你现在连话都不跟我说了
What,now you're not even talking to me?

287
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:20,150
听我说，对不起 我很抱歉，我当时疯了
Look,Rachel,I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I was out of my mind.

288
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,950
我以为我会失去你 不知道如何是好
I thought I'd lost you.

289
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:25,180
我一定是完全疯了 才会做这种事
How insane must I have been to do something like this?

290
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:29,490
我不是对爱情不忠的人 我不是这种人，我不是乔伊
I don't cheat,right? That's not me. I'm not Joey!

291
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:43,400
现在是半夜三点了 他们还不知道我已经回家了
It's 3 a. m. They don't know that I've come home yet.

292
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,680
他们也没奇怪我到哪里去了
You notice how they aren't wondering where I am?

293
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:50,850
人有时候就是只想到自己
You know,people can be so self-involved.

294
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:56,180
你知道吗？ 不是我要冷静一下的
You know what? I'm not the one that wanted that break.

295
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:59,020
是你要离开的，是你…
You're the one that bailed. You're the one...

296
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:01,420
是你在事情 不顺利的时候逃跑的
...that ran the moment things got rough.

297
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:02,750
那… 那怎么样？
-That's -That's what?

298
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,620
既不是当时，也不是现在 现在我们…
-That is neither here nor there. -Here we are...

299
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,960
又是进退两难 你打算怎么办？
...in a spot again. What do you want?

300
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:11,930
你打算怎么处理？ 你想继续努力还是逃跑？
How do you want to handle it? You want to fight for us or bail?

301
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,870
听我说，我做了一件过份 而且非常愚蠢的事
Look,I did a terrible,stupid,stupid thing,okay?

302
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,910
对不起，我希望能改变历史 但是不可能
I'm sorry. I wish I could take it back,but I can't.

303
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,380
我只是不能眼睁睁看着 一段美好的感情就此破灭
I just can't see us throwing away something we know is so damn good.

304
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:33,520
我好爱你
I love you so much.

305
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,030
不要，罗斯，不要
No,Ross! Don't!

306
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,610
你不能吻我两下 就让整件事烟消云散
You can't just kiss me and make it all go away.

307
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,400
事情不是这样的 这样只会越弄越糟
It doesn't work that way. It doesn't just make it better.

308
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,720
我觉得你应该离开
I think you should go.

309
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,080
什么？
What?

310
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:06,450
我真的觉得你该走了
I really think you need to go now.

311
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:14,930
今天早上你还说 我们什么事情都可以沟通
This morning you said there was nothing we couldn't work out.

312
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,790
我那时候知道什么？
What the hell did I know?

313
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:20,060
我们一定有办法度过这一关
There's got to be a way we can work past this.

314
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:23,240
我不能想像没有你的日子
I can't imagine my life without you.

315
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,610
没有这双手臂
Without these arms...

316
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,380
你的脸孔和你的心
...and your face and heart...

317
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,640
你善良的心，瑞秋…
...your good heart,Rach,and....

318
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:44,560
我办不到 你在我眼里完全变了
I can't. You're a totally different person to me now.

319
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:50,290
我以前总觉得 你永远永远不会伤害我
I used to think of you as somebody that would never,ever hurt me.

320
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:51,660
永远不会
Ever.

321
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,570
现在我满脑子都是 你跟她的画面
Now I can't stop picturing you with her.

322
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:59,470
我做不到 你说什么、做什么都没用
I can't. It doesn't matter what you say or what you do.

323
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,310
一切都不能回头了
It's just changed everything.

324
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,410
永远不能
Forever.

325
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,920
不可能会这样
This can't be it.

326
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,430
那为什么事实就是如此？
Then how come it is?

327
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,240
他们好久没动静了
They've been quiet for a long time.

328
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:42,750
也许她把他杀了
Maybe she killed him.

329
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,350
我们走吧
Let's go.

330
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,980
这是你新的走路姿势吗？
Is that your new walk?

331
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,760
不是，我快尿出来了
No. I really have to pee.
