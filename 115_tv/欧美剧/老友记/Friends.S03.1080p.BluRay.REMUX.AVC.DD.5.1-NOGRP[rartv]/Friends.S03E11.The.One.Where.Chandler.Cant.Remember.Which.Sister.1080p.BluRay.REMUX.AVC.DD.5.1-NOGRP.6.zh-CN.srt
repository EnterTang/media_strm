-Hi. -Hi.

Isn't it great?

对，他简直太完美了

138
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,600
I mean,when he left,I actually used the phrase:
他走的时候，我是这么说的…

139
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,740
"Hummina,hummina,hummina."
哈米娜…（因一见钟情的兴奋又害羞不知所措的胡言乱语）

That's excellent.

So he's "just a nice guy."
这么说他只是个大好人罢了

142
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,050
Do you really think this Mark doesn't want anything for helping you?
你真的认为这个叫马克的 是不求回报地帮你？

143
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:25,310

我想我得跟他一起洗个澡

144
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,080
But that's true of any job.

你去哪里了？你拆了礼物之后 我们就找不到你了

我后来跑到贮藏室 而且不只我一个人

Why,what happened?

I fooled around with Joey's sister.
我跟乔伊的姐妹瞎搞

153
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,850

What is the worst part?

Are you insane?

We didn't fool around with any of them.
我们可没有跟哪个胡搞

It's got to be Veronica. The girl in the red skirt.
一定是薇若妮卡 那个穿红裙子的女孩

Ask Chandler. He fooled around with her.

她告诉我，你对她说 你为她大为倾倒

这是实话？还是你泡我妹妹 只是为了忘记珍妮丝？
