1
00:00:08,185 --> 00:00:12,120
So, what happened?
Did a forest tick you off?

2
00:00:12,788 --> 00:00:17,315
No. You know how we're always
saying we need a place for the mail.

3
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:21,823
Yeah?

4
00:00:22,396 --> 00:00:27,526
I started building one. But then
I decided to take it to the next step.

5
00:00:28,701 --> 00:00:31,032
You're building a post office?

6
00:00:31,937 --> 00:00:35,167
No, an entertainment unit
with a built-in mail cubby.

7
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:39,205
- It's a one-day job, max.
- Okay.

8
00:00:39,743 --> 00:00:42,507
My word, those are snug!

9
00:00:43,847 --> 00:00:46,508
Yeah. These are
my old work pants.

10
00:00:46,815 --> 00:00:48,908
Sergio Valente.

11
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:01,119
Power saw kind of got away
from me there.

12
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:04,889
The One With Frank Jr.

13
00:01:52,034 --> 00:01:54,661
Hey, Pheebs.
Any sign of your brother?

14
00:01:54,836 --> 00:01:56,861
No, but he's always late.

15
00:01:57,071 --> 00:01:59,403
- I thought you only met him once.
- I did.

16
00:02:01,075 --> 00:02:04,510
I think it sounds big sister-y,
"Frank's always late."

17
00:02:05,545 --> 00:02:07,739
Well, relax. He'll be here.

18
00:02:07,913 --> 00:02:09,847
I know.
I'm just nervous.

19
00:02:10,015 --> 00:02:13,211
It's just, Mom's dead,
don't talk to my sister...

20
00:02:13,451 --> 00:02:16,079
...Grandma's been sleeping
a lot lately.

21
00:02:16,686 --> 00:02:20,747
It's just the last-desperate-
chance-to-have-a-family kind of thing.

22
00:02:20,924 --> 00:02:22,550
You're sweet to wait with me.

23
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:26,717
Actually, Gunther sent me. You're not
allowed to have cups out here.

24
00:02:29,797 --> 00:02:32,264
Does anyone else think
David Copperfield's cute?

25
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:37,597
No. But he told me he thinks
you're a fox.

26
00:02:39,405 --> 00:02:41,099
All right. Janice likes him.

27
00:02:41,272 --> 00:02:45,231
In fact, she likes him so much,
she put him on her freebie list.

28
00:02:46,643 --> 00:02:47,735
Her what?

29
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:53,109
We have a deal where we each get to pick
five celebrities we could sleep with...

30
00:02:53,883 --> 00:02:56,009
...and the other one can't get mad.

31
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:59,381
The heart of every
healthy relationship:

32
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:03,011
Honesty, respect
and sex with celebrities.

33
00:03:03,624 --> 00:03:05,215
So who's on your list?

34
00:03:05,391 --> 00:03:06,915
Kim Basinger...

35
00:03:07,093 --> 00:03:09,391
...Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry...

36
00:03:09,695 --> 00:03:11,458
...Yasmine Bleeth...

37
00:03:12,464 --> 00:03:14,658
...and Jessica Rabbit.

38
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,599
You do realize that she is a cartoon
and way out of your league?

39
00:03:20,804 --> 00:03:24,830
I know. I always wondered if I could
get her eyes to pop out of her head.

40
00:03:26,442 --> 00:03:27,841
This is such a great thing.

41
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:32,378
Annie Esposito would never have
dumped me had we had a list like this.

42
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:36,642
And also, of course,
if her sister was famous.

43
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:39,283
Who would yours be?

44
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:42,486
First, I need a boyfriend.
Then I can have a list.

45
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,222
It's just a game, Mon.

46
00:03:47,292 --> 00:03:48,724
Rach, how about you?

47
00:03:48,893 --> 00:03:53,023
I don't know. I guess Chris
O'Donnell, John F. Kennedy Jr...

48
00:03:53,296 --> 00:03:56,959
...Daniel Day-Lewis, Sting
and Parker Stevenson.

49
00:03:58,734 --> 00:04:00,463
Spider-Man?

50
00:04:00,636 --> 00:04:02,433
Hardy Boy.

51
00:04:02,871 --> 00:04:05,839
- Peter Parker.
- Thank you.

52
00:04:06,374 --> 00:04:08,898
What about you, honey?
Who'd be on your list?

53
00:04:09,176 --> 00:04:12,611
That kind of thing
requires some serious thought.

54
00:04:12,778 --> 00:04:16,805
First, I'd divide my prospective
candidates into categories.

55
00:04:16,982 --> 00:04:18,005
What a geek!

56
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,852
Everybody, this is Frank!
My half brother, Frank!

57
00:04:23,086 --> 00:04:24,485
This is everybody.

58
00:04:24,688 --> 00:04:26,485
- This is Ross.
- How are you?

59
00:04:26,657 --> 00:04:28,351
- Chandler.
- Hi.

60
00:04:28,524 --> 00:04:30,992
- Joey.
- Hey.

61
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,621
This is Monica.

62
00:04:35,397 --> 00:04:37,057
And this is Rachel.

63
00:04:40,835 --> 00:04:42,324
I'm gonna get coffee for us.

64
00:04:42,602 --> 00:04:45,298
Hey, how do you guys get
anything done?

65
00:04:45,772 --> 00:04:47,671
We don't, really.

66
00:04:49,074 --> 00:04:50,905
So now,
do you guys have big plans?

67
00:04:51,076 --> 00:04:54,977
Yeah. We're gonna connect
and bond and everything.

68
00:04:55,179 --> 00:04:59,808
I thought we could go down to Times
Square and pick up some ninja stars.

69
00:04:59,983 --> 00:05:04,112
My friend Larry, he wants me
to take a picture of a hooker.

70
00:05:05,754 --> 00:05:08,722
We really don't take advantage
of living in the city.

71
00:05:23,201 --> 00:05:25,395
Sorry. Did I get you?

72
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,869
No, you didn't get me!

73
00:05:28,105 --> 00:05:31,471
It's an electric drill!
You get me, you kill me!

74
00:05:32,575 --> 00:05:34,838
Calm down!
Do you want this unit or not?

75
00:05:35,143 --> 00:05:37,475
I do not want this unit!

76
00:05:37,679 --> 00:05:40,772
You should've told me before.
I'm not a mind reader.

77
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,575
And we're out of beer.
I'm going to Monica's.

78
00:05:46,186 --> 00:05:47,380
Fine!

79
00:05:54,792 --> 00:05:57,522
Where you heading in those pants?
1982?

80
00:05:59,162 --> 00:06:00,254
Monica, listen...

81
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:04,365
...I saw down at the hardware store,
they got those designer tiles on sale...

82
00:06:04,533 --> 00:06:06,694
...if you wanna redo
your bathroom floor.

83
00:06:06,869 --> 00:06:08,836
What's wrong with my bathroom floor?

84
00:06:09,004 --> 00:06:11,871
Nothing. It's just old and dingy,
that's all.

85
00:06:12,774 --> 00:06:16,072
- I highly doubt that.
- Oh, yeah?

86
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:18,972
If you move your hamper...

87
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:22,876
...you can see the color
the tile used to be.

88
00:06:24,616 --> 00:06:27,517
I can't live like this!
What are we gonna do?

89
00:06:27,686 --> 00:06:29,084
Relax. Here, hold this.

90
00:06:29,253 --> 00:06:32,017
This old stuff comes right up.
I'll show you.

91
00:06:34,724 --> 00:06:37,249
A little more than I wanted to see.

92
00:06:39,962 --> 00:06:42,987
Look at that!
Every inch of this is glued down.

93
00:06:43,164 --> 00:06:45,792
It'd take forever to pry this up.

94
00:06:45,967 --> 00:06:48,093
You should just leave it.

95
00:06:48,635 --> 00:06:53,230
I can't leave it! You gouged
a hole in my dingy floor!

96
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,179
There. There you go.

97
00:07:04,648 --> 00:07:05,979
Yeah, that's nice.

98
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:09,915
We can put it back there after the
surgeons remove it from your colon.

99
00:07:11,287 --> 00:07:12,412
Give me a new floor!

100
00:07:12,587 --> 00:07:16,353
I can't. Chandler will kill me
if I don't finish the unit.

101
00:07:16,524 --> 00:07:20,392
- I'll pay you double what he's paying you.
- He's not paying me anything.

102
00:07:20,561 --> 00:07:22,084
Triple.

103
00:07:33,705 --> 00:07:34,694
What?

104
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:37,840
I know what I wanted to ask you.
Can you roll your tongue?

105
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,768
Because I can and my mom couldn't.

106
00:07:41,944 --> 00:07:45,470
And I figured that was
something I got from our dad.

107
00:07:45,647 --> 00:07:48,013
Well, wait, you mean like this?

108
00:07:49,184 --> 00:07:51,378
Yeah, you can do it too. Yeah.

109
00:07:52,653 --> 00:07:53,915
You're not doing it.

110
00:07:54,254 --> 00:07:57,711
Oh, right. Okay.
Yeah, my mom could and I can't.

111
00:07:59,058 --> 00:08:01,082
We don't have that.

112
00:08:06,664 --> 00:08:09,497
- When's your birthday?
- February 16.

113
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:12,129
I know a guy who's the 18th.

114
00:08:14,104 --> 00:08:15,934
That's close.

115
00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:20,571
- When's yours?
- October 25.

116
00:08:24,778 --> 00:08:27,269
That's the same month as Halloween.

117
00:08:31,584 --> 00:08:34,677
So, what kind of things
do you like to do at home?

118
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,985
Melt stuff.

119
00:08:41,425 --> 00:08:45,053
- Okay, I've got three of my five.
- Three of your five what?

120
00:08:45,628 --> 00:08:48,324
Celebrities I'm allowed to sleep with.

121
00:08:48,663 --> 00:08:50,893
God, you're giving this
a lot of thought.

122
00:08:51,066 --> 00:08:53,761
Hey, it's hard, okay?
I only have two spots left.

123
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:57,097
All right. Who you got it
narrowed down to?

124
00:08:57,304 --> 00:09:00,568
- Elizabeth Hurley.
- Very attractive.

125
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,332
Forgiving.

126
00:09:04,576 --> 00:09:06,237
Susan Sarandon.

127
00:09:07,912 --> 00:09:10,107
You know what?
She's too political.

128
00:09:10,281 --> 00:09:14,944
She probably wouldn't let you do it unless
you donated four cans of food first.

129
00:09:16,286 --> 00:09:20,449
- And Isabella Rossellini.
- Very hot. Very sexy.

130
00:09:20,623 --> 00:09:23,921
But she's too international.

131
00:09:24,092 --> 00:09:25,855
She's never gonna be around.

132
00:09:26,027 --> 00:09:28,392
- So?
- So you gotta play the odds.

133
00:09:28,562 --> 00:09:31,725
Pick somebody who's gonna be
in the country all the time.

134
00:09:32,298 --> 00:09:36,893
Yeah. Because that's why you won't
get Isabella Rossellini. Geography.

135
00:09:46,876 --> 00:09:50,243
Okay. So by "melting"
you meant melting.

136
00:09:52,347 --> 00:09:55,578
- So is it, like, art?
- Yeah, you can melt art.

137
00:09:57,718 --> 00:10:00,084
Hey, can I use your phone?

138
00:10:00,521 --> 00:10:04,616
- Sure. You want to call your mom?
- No, I want to melt it.

139
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,492
Just the numbers.
It will still work.

140
00:10:09,995 --> 00:10:12,690
Well, not right now.

141
00:10:18,669 --> 00:10:22,764
I'm gonna go to bed. The fumes
are giving me a headache. So...

142
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:29,841
Good night, bro.

143
00:10:30,411 --> 00:10:31,605
Good night.

144
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:37,175
Here.

145
00:10:37,884 --> 00:10:39,215
Just in case.

146
00:10:39,952 --> 00:10:42,045
Oh, excellent!

147
00:10:55,331 --> 00:10:58,789
- What kind of karate is that?
- No kind.

148
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,226
He just makes it up.

149
00:11:02,637 --> 00:11:06,402
- How's it going with you guys?
- So far it kind of blows.

150
00:11:10,476 --> 00:11:13,933
I don't know, I just thought
he'd feel more like a brother.

151
00:11:14,212 --> 00:11:16,578
Like you and Ross.
Close and connected and...

152
00:11:16,748 --> 00:11:19,477
Honey, we're close now.
You wouldn't believe the years...

153
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:25,713
...of noogies and wedgies and flying
wedgies and atomic wedgies and...

154
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:28,584
That's when the waistband
goes over your head.

155
00:11:31,593 --> 00:11:33,890
We drove each other crazy
playing the shadow game.

156
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:37,030
- How do you play the shadow game?
- How do you play the shadow game?

157
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:39,392
- I just asked you.
- I just asked you.

158
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:41,659
I don't have time for this.

159
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:43,165
That is what the game is.

160
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:46,566
You just gave up really quickly.

161
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:49,867
- You seen Joey?
- What's the matter?

162
00:11:50,108 --> 00:11:52,667
Just this!

163
00:11:57,346 --> 00:12:02,078
It's my fault, really, because the
couch is where we keep the varnish.

164
00:12:03,952 --> 00:12:06,284
Somebody wanna hand me
one of those tiles?

165
00:12:08,756 --> 00:12:11,452
- What's going on?
- He's retiling my floor.

166
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:14,524
Spackle boy!

167
00:12:15,395 --> 00:12:16,622
Get up!

168
00:12:16,795 --> 00:12:20,390
- You started this, you will finish it!
- He started mine first!

169
00:12:20,566 --> 00:12:23,500
Build the unit, Cinderellie
Lay the tile, Cinderellie

170
00:12:29,005 --> 00:12:32,462
- He was helping me first.
- No, I need a bathroom. I'm a girl!

171
00:12:32,641 --> 00:12:34,632
You guys figure it out.
I'm taking a break.

172
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,674
- That's good.
- Take a break?

173
00:12:36,844 --> 00:12:39,506
Yeah. I think even God
rested on the seventh day.

174
00:12:40,348 --> 00:12:42,076
Joey, if this takes seven days...

175
00:12:42,249 --> 00:12:46,241
...you'll be able to meet God
and ask him about it yourself.

176
00:12:53,158 --> 00:12:55,387
Big octopus.

177
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:06,566
Oh, my God! I totally forgot.

178
00:13:06,735 --> 00:13:09,135
Well, can't someone else do it?

179
00:13:09,304 --> 00:13:11,669
But I have company.

180
00:13:14,408 --> 00:13:17,638
Look, that's all right.
I'll come in. Okay.

181
00:13:18,245 --> 00:13:20,678
I'm sorry,
but I have to go into work.

182
00:13:20,913 --> 00:13:24,575
It's one of my regulars.
He's insisting that I do him, so...

183
00:13:24,749 --> 00:13:27,149
Hey, what kind of work do you do?

184
00:13:27,619 --> 00:13:31,019
I'm a masseuse.
I give people massages and stuff.

185
00:13:31,188 --> 00:13:35,089
You work at one of
those massage parlors?

186
00:13:36,092 --> 00:13:39,458
Well, you know, we don't call it that.
But, yeah.

187
00:13:42,664 --> 00:13:44,688
That's wild.

188
00:13:44,965 --> 00:13:49,060
- No, I had no idea.
- Alrighty.

189
00:13:49,969 --> 00:13:53,734
I'll be back in a little bit.
Unless you want to come with me.

190
00:13:53,905 --> 00:13:55,839
You mean, like, watch?

191
00:13:56,808 --> 00:14:01,005
No. No, you can get one yourself.
It'll be on the house.

192
00:14:01,178 --> 00:14:03,168
What are big sisters for?

193
00:14:03,613 --> 00:14:06,605
Well, I don't think this. You know?

194
00:14:06,783 --> 00:14:08,841
No. No, no.
I wouldn't do you myself.

195
00:14:09,051 --> 00:14:10,951
I mean, that would be weird.

196
00:14:12,388 --> 00:14:14,787
I'll get one of the
other girls to do it.

197
00:14:14,956 --> 00:14:17,515
This is so much fun!

198
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,551
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

199
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:25,762
Hey, do Monica and Rachel
work there?

200
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:29,533
It's beautiful!

201
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:33,227
It's like the first bathroom
floor there ever was.

202
00:14:35,072 --> 00:14:37,505
What are you going in there for?

203
00:14:37,674 --> 00:14:39,539
You want, like, a number?

204
00:14:42,978 --> 00:14:45,503
- Hey.
- Hi. Bye.

205
00:14:46,981 --> 00:14:49,575
Okay. I'm done with my choices.

206
00:14:49,784 --> 00:14:52,217
These are final.

207
00:14:53,186 --> 00:14:56,279
- Well, it's about time.
- Yeah. Very official.

208
00:14:56,455 --> 00:15:00,653
Yeah. Well, you know, Chandler
printed it up on his computer.

209
00:15:00,826 --> 00:15:03,259
And who laminated it?

210
00:15:04,262 --> 00:15:06,286
That was me.

211
00:15:06,463 --> 00:15:08,158
All right, let me see.

212
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,564
"Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder,
Elizabeth Hurley...

213
00:15:12,835 --> 00:15:14,132
...Michelle Pfeiffer...

214
00:15:15,171 --> 00:15:17,832
...Dorothy Hamill"?

215
00:15:22,643 --> 00:15:25,111
Hey, it's my list!

216
00:15:25,311 --> 00:15:29,372
You do realize she only spins
like that on ice?

217
00:15:38,255 --> 00:15:40,745
- What's going on?
- She broke my arm!

218
00:15:40,924 --> 00:15:43,757
- He touched my fanny.
- She touched mine first!

219
00:15:43,927 --> 00:15:45,416
That's my job!

220
00:15:45,594 --> 00:15:50,758
So, what's the deal? I can have sex
with you, but I can't touch you?

221
00:15:50,965 --> 00:15:54,331
- You can't have sex with her!
- Did you think I was a hooker?

222
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:59,233
No, okay. I know. You're a masseuse.
It's cool. I'm not a cop!

223
00:16:01,374 --> 00:16:04,467
Ask Mr. Wiffler if he
can wait for five minutes.

224
00:16:04,642 --> 00:16:06,109
Fine.

225
00:16:06,277 --> 00:16:08,677
I don't like you.

226
00:16:09,713 --> 00:16:13,342
So that's what you thought I did?
God!

227
00:16:13,983 --> 00:16:15,746
That's not what I do!

228
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:19,176
Wait, that's not what you do?

229
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,345
No!

230
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:23,081
Why would you think that?

231
00:16:23,257 --> 00:16:26,624
I don't know. This is the city,
you know? I just...

232
00:16:26,894 --> 00:16:28,155
I mean...

233
00:16:28,361 --> 00:16:29,760
...I don't know.

234
00:16:31,297 --> 00:16:35,198
Whatever. It's the perfect end
to the perfect weekend anyway.

235
00:16:36,568 --> 00:16:37,795
Wait.

236
00:16:37,969 --> 00:16:41,666
No, you're right.
No, it was perfect.

237
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,535
I can't believe
I screwed it up so bad.

238
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:50,144
- You thought it was perfect?
- Well, no, maybe it wasn't perfect...

239
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:53,006
...but you know, it was pretty cool,
you know?

240
00:16:53,181 --> 00:16:57,049
Because we had all those
great talks, you know?

241
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:03,350
Which ones in particular
were great for you?

242
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,984
Well, you know, about
the tongue thing, you know?

243
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:10,855
And how I told you about
my likes and my dislikes.

244
00:17:12,463 --> 00:17:17,525
How I like to melt stuff, and how
I dislike stuff that doesn't melt.

245
00:17:18,601 --> 00:17:20,831
Right. Okay.

246
00:17:21,004 --> 00:17:27,339
I feel like I can really talk to you
because you're my sister, you know?

247
00:17:28,676 --> 00:17:31,303
Yeah. I guess I do.

248
00:17:31,478 --> 00:17:35,710
And then I go feel your friend up
and make you mad at me.

249
00:17:36,615 --> 00:17:40,244
Well, I wasn't hopping mad,
you know?

250
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:43,314
You hopped a little bit.

251
00:17:44,756 --> 00:17:48,020
Yeah, I'm really sorry.
You know, I'm really...

252
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:50,892
Okay.

253
00:17:52,562 --> 00:17:56,190
Well, this is my favorite part
of the weekend. Right now. This.

254
00:17:56,364 --> 00:17:58,195
This?

255
00:17:58,366 --> 00:18:00,799
Oh, come on.
We went to Times Square.

256
00:18:01,035 --> 00:18:04,095
We found ninja stars. I almost
get my arm broken by a hooker...

257
00:18:04,305 --> 00:18:06,169
She's not a hooker.

258
00:18:06,339 --> 00:18:09,899
When I tell my friends about her,
she will be.

259
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:22,075
Phoebe, what's that?

260
00:18:22,252 --> 00:18:25,414
Frank Jr. Gave me this before he left.
A present.

261
00:18:25,588 --> 00:18:28,056
It used to belong to our dad.
His garage-door opener.

262
00:18:28,224 --> 00:18:30,384
Until Frank melted it.

263
00:18:32,827 --> 00:18:34,316
Cool!

264
00:18:40,266 --> 00:18:42,894
Sound the bell, gather up
all the men you can find.

265
00:18:43,069 --> 00:18:46,094
We got ourselves
an entertainment unit raising.

266
00:18:49,006 --> 00:18:51,099
No, seriously,
can you help us?

267
00:18:54,377 --> 00:18:56,072
Okay, on three!

268
00:18:56,246 --> 00:18:59,976
- One, two...
- Why don't we just go on two?

269
00:19:00,148 --> 00:19:02,810
- Why two?
- Because it's faster.

270
00:19:02,984 --> 00:19:06,283
I could've counted to three four times
without all the two talk.

271
00:19:06,454 --> 00:19:11,857
- All right, but in the future...
- Heavy thing! Not getting lighter!

272
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:15,983
- One, two...
- So we are going with two?

273
00:19:25,135 --> 00:19:27,864
A good job, Joe.

274
00:19:28,037 --> 00:19:30,767
Wow. It's big.

275
00:19:32,774 --> 00:19:35,538
So big it actually makes
our doors look smaller.

276
00:19:36,378 --> 00:19:40,541
- Maybe my ruler's wrong.
- Maybe all the rulers are wrong.

277
00:19:41,248 --> 00:19:45,707
It's not that bad. So it blocks a
little of your door, a little of mine.

278
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,044
I got a better idea.

279
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:50,814
How about it blocks none of my door
and a lot of your door?

280
00:19:54,025 --> 00:19:58,358
Listen, before I forget,
that side is still wet.

281
00:20:05,934 --> 00:20:08,732
Arm hair stuck!
Arm hair stuck!

282
00:20:13,607 --> 00:20:15,767
Let me just see
if I've got this right.

283
00:20:15,942 --> 00:20:19,378
So this is a half-caf, double-tall,
easy hazelnut...

284
00:20:19,545 --> 00:20:24,641
...nonfat, no foam, with whip,
extra-hot latte, right?

285
00:20:24,816 --> 00:20:26,248
Okay. Great.

286
00:20:26,951 --> 00:20:28,680
You freak.

287
00:20:34,624 --> 00:20:35,749
Thank you.

288
00:20:35,924 --> 00:20:38,188
A coffee to go, please.

289
00:20:41,796 --> 00:20:46,027
- Isabella Rossellini!
- Are you serious? Oh, my God!

290
00:20:46,232 --> 00:20:49,792
Damn! I cannot believe
I took her off my list.

291
00:20:49,969 --> 00:20:52,938
Why? Because otherwise
you'd go for it?

292
00:20:54,906 --> 00:20:56,931
Yeah, maybe.

293
00:20:57,108 --> 00:20:58,939
You lie.

294
00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:01,174
You don't think I'd go up to her?

295
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:06,441
It took you 10 years to finally admit
you liked me.

296
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:12,620
Yeah? Well, missy, you better be glad
that list is laminated.

297
00:21:12,787 --> 00:21:17,120
You know what, honey? You go ahead.
We'll call her an alternate.

298
00:21:18,025 --> 00:21:21,892
- Okay. Hold my cruller.
- Okay.

299
00:21:22,829 --> 00:21:24,762
Are you really gonna
let him do this?

300
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:27,455
He's about to go hit
on Isabella Rossellini.

301
00:21:27,633 --> 00:21:30,294
I'm just sorry we don't got popcorn.

302
00:21:35,505 --> 00:21:36,995
I'm Ross.

303
00:21:37,173 --> 00:21:40,869
You don't know me,
but I'm a big, big fan of yours.

304
00:21:41,043 --> 00:21:42,476
I mean...

305
00:21:42,644 --> 00:21:44,009
...Blue Velvet.

306
00:21:47,248 --> 00:21:51,047
I was wondering if I could maybe
buy you a cup of coffee.

307
00:21:51,218 --> 00:21:53,685
Or reimburse you for that one.

308
00:21:55,721 --> 00:21:57,950
Aren't you with that girl over there?

309
00:22:02,526 --> 00:22:04,153
Well, yeah, kind of.

310
00:22:04,328 --> 00:22:07,057
But that's okay.
We have an understanding.

311
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:12,223
We each have this list of five famous
people, and you were one of mine.

312
00:22:12,401 --> 00:22:15,097
So I'm allowed to sleep with you.

313
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:18,033
No, no, no.
It's flattering.

314
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:24,567
- I don't know...
- Wait. Wait, Isabella.

315
00:22:24,778 --> 00:22:29,271
Don't dismiss this so fast. This is
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

316
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:31,607
Yeah, for you.

317
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:34,781
- Is that the list?
- Yes.

318
00:22:34,952 --> 00:22:36,612
- Can I see it?
- No.

319
00:22:36,787 --> 00:22:39,085
- Come on.
- But... Okay.

320
00:22:39,723 --> 00:22:41,280
I'm not on the list!

321
00:22:41,457 --> 00:22:43,687
But that's not the final draft.

322
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,159
It's laminated.

323
00:22:48,096 --> 00:22:50,757
Okay, see, you were on my list.

324
00:22:50,964 --> 00:22:53,398
But then my friend Chandler...

325
00:22:56,269 --> 00:22:59,397
...brought up the very good point
that you are international.

326
00:22:59,572 --> 00:23:02,836
So I bumped you for Winona Ryder.
Local.

327
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:06,832
You know, it's ironic
because I have a list...

328
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:09,911
...of five goofy coffeehouse guys.

329
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,483
And yesterday, I just bumped you
for that guy over there.

330
00:23:22,256 --> 00:23:24,689
We're just gonna be friends.

331
00:23:28,662 --> 00:23:30,959
You know what?

332
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:34,030
Bet you I could fit in there.

333
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:37,726
I got 5 bucks says you can't.

334
00:23:38,969 --> 00:23:41,267
Get out your checkbook, mister.

335
00:23:41,905 --> 00:23:44,566
I think I have the cash.

336
00:23:49,711 --> 00:23:51,872
You are dog, man!

337
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:54,844
I totally fit!

338
00:23:55,015 --> 00:23:57,142
Yeah. You got me.

339
00:23:57,318 --> 00:24:00,548
I'm out 5 big ones.

340
00:24:03,188 --> 00:24:04,450
There you go.

341
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,717
Thank you.

342
00:24:10,361 --> 00:24:13,261
Well, hello, Mr. Lincoln!

343
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:16,355
Better luck next time, buddy!

344
00:24:16,533 --> 00:24:18,523
And the drinks are on me!

345
00:24:19,869 --> 00:24:20,700
