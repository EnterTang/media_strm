0
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:05,938
So your first sexual experience
was with a woman?

1
00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:09,434
l was 1 5.
lt was my best friend, Ruth.

2
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:12,042
And we got drunk
on that hard cider.

3
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:15,042
And then suddenly,
we were making out.

4
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,081
Tell it again.

5
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:21,654
Seriously.

6
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:28,455
ls that woman capable of talking
about anything else but sex?

7
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:33,094
Yeah, sure. Earlier she was
talking about geography.

8
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:37,969
She was listing the countries
she's done it in.

9
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:40,906
l think we all
learned something.

10
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,772
Hey, you guys. Look what l found!
Look at this.

11
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:47,208
That's my mom's writing.
Look.

12
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:51,111
''Me and Frank and Phoebe,
graduation, 1 965.''

13
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:55,083
-Do you know what that means?
-That you're actually 50?

14
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:58,253
That's not me, Phoebe.
That's her pal Phoebe.

15
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,824
According to her high-school
yearbook, they were BFF.

16
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:05,825
-Best Friends Forever.
-That's great!

17
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:10,264
l know! She probably has all kinds
of stories about my parents.

18
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,233
And she might even know
where my dad is.

19
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,373
l looked her up.
She lives by the beach.

20
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,439
Maybe this weekend
we can go to the beach.

21
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:17,974
Yeah, we can!

22
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:21,272
-Shoot, l can't go. l have to work.
-That's too bad.

23
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:23,608
Big fat bummer.

24
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:27,585
So, great! Tomorrow we're
gonna drive out to Montauk.

25
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:30,153
Hey, Bonnie had sex there!

26
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:38,329
Friends MeitinaFinal V1.0 S03E25

29
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:22,667
Joey will be right down.
He's looking for his mask.

30
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:24,844
-A swim mask?
-No, his gorilla mask.

31
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:29,279
He wears it in the ocean
to scare off the fish.

32
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:33,608
Would you look at them?

33
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:36,922
l'm never gonna find
a boyfriend again.

34
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:39,455
l'm gonna die an old maid.

35
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,923
You're not gonna die an old maid.

36
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:44,688
Maybe an old spinster cook.

37
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:50,502
-Thanks.
-Besides, worse comes to worse...

38
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:52,864
...l'll be your boyfriend.

39
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:56,931
Yeah, right.

40
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:02,113
Why is that so funny?

41
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,374
You made a joke, right?

42
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,984
So l laughed.

43
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,818
A little too hard.

44
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:13,483
What am l,
not boyfriend material?

45
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:16,252
No. You're Chandler.

46
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:20,730
You know. Chandler!

47
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:24,434
Okay, so we've established
my name and hit me.

48
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:28,073
But theoretically, say we weren't
friends. Say it's a blind date.

49
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:32,870
l show up at your door, and l'm,
like, ''Hey, nice to meet you.''

50
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:38,308
l'd probably be scared of a guy
using a fake voice.

51
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,247
Hey. Good!
You bought food.

52
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,922
No, just my luggage.

53
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,225
l am having the best karma this week.

54
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,560
First, l find this woman
who knew my parents...

55
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:58,737
...then my client with the fuzzy back
gives me his beach house.

56
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:01,736
What about that bike
messenger you hit?

57
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:04,273
l wasn't talking about his karma.

58
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,670
Hey, check out the hat!

59
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,815
Wait a minute, l know that hat.

60
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,989
l was taken aboard that hat.

61
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,950
They did experiments on me.
l can't have children!

62
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,559
Seriously, where did you get the hat?

63
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,197
Ross gave it to me.

64
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,163
-l think she looks good.
-Thank you.

65
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,599
Did he buy it for you...

66
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:32,964
...or win it for you?

67
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,007
Excuse me,
my fashion-impaired friends...

68
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,201
...l'm here to tell you
that hats are back.

69
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:43,109
And this time, they've ganged up
and formed one giant superhat.

70
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:50,279
Go, go, go!

71
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,720
Now everybody wants to be
under the hat!

72
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,229
What's with all this sand?

73
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,960
Bob said there might be flood damage.

74
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:07,366
Either that, or he has
a really big cat.

75
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:11,167
You know what this reminds me of?

76
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,943
Why couldn't l be your boyfriend?

77
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:17,440
Are you still on that?

78
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,141
-Would you let it go already?
-Thank you, Joey.

79
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:22,480
But you'd go out with me, right?

80
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:26,386
No. lt's the same as with Chandler.
We're friends.

81
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:29,493
Let's say that we were
the last two guys on the planet...

82
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:32,722
...and you had a gun to your head.
Which one would you pick?

83
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,662
Which one of you
has the gun to my head?

84
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,537
Well, yes.
lt's kind of an unusual house.

85
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:45,575
lt has three beautiful bedrooms
and no baths.

86
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,870
But, you know,
the ocean is right there.

87
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:50,705
Knock, knock, knock.

88
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:53,215
Hang on a second.
Come in, come in.

89
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,410
So think about it and call me back.

90
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:59,487
-Are you Phoebe Abbott?
-Yes.

91
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,991
Surprise, Phoebe Abbott!
l'm your best friend's daughter!

92
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:06,762
You're lrwin's daughter?

93
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,297
No. l mean your old best friend.

94
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:10,469
Here.

95
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,162
-Lily? From high school? Remember?
-Oh, God, Lily.

96
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,036
Yes. Of course l remember Lily.

97
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,236
-Then you must be--
-Phoebe, Phoebe.

98
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,279
She named me after you, l guess.

99
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:28,347
Wow. Well.
Look, there's Frank!

100
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:32,650
Yeah! Yes! Yes, yes!
That's my dad. That's Frank!

101
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,759
l'm sorry l'm getting all flingy.

102
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:38,453
Take it easy.
lf you want, there's cookies.

103
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:41,497
-Or sangria! l could make sangria!
-No, no!

104
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:44,293
Sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.

105
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:50,167
Anyway, l've been
looking for my father.

106
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:54,807
-Have you heard from him or seen him?
-No, l'm sorry.

107
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:58,916
l guess l lost track of everybody
after high school.

108
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,788
Well, so tell me everything
about my parents. Everything.

109
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:08,188
Well, you know,
we were always together.

110
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:11,886
-The other kids had a nickname for us.
-What was it?

111
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,565
The Three Losers.

112
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,493
Poor Lily.

113
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,170
l heard about what happened. That
must have been just terrible for you...

114
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,866
...losing your mother that way.

115
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,811
Yeah, no, it was great.

116
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,751
You know what a really good
rainy-day game is?

117
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,793
-What?
-l mean, naked game.

118
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:47,025
-We should totally play strip poker.
-No!

119
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,598
Are you crazy?

120
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:52,328
Come on. When you go away,
you have to play. lt's, like, a law.

121
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,304
Well, it's not a law.

122
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:58,068
As long as it stays attached to that
tax reform bill, it never will be!

123
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:01,140
-All done.
-Thank you.

124
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,815
Okay. Who's next?

125
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,285
No!

126
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,117
No way!

127
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:13,486
Come on, please. l'm bored.
You let me do it once before.

128
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,129
Well, if that's the rule
this weekend....

129
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,062
-Get away.
-Take it like a man. Come on!

130
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:28,996
Big bullies!

131
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:46,149
-How are we doing?
-Bored and bored.

132
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:50,161
You know what naked card game's
never boring?

133
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,330
No!

134
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:54,928
So, what's Phoebe like?

135
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:58,898
l'm kind, caring and sweet.
What's Monica like?

136
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,531
No, the other Phoebe.
The one you went to see?

137
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:05,369
l think she knows where my dad is!

138
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,603
-Cool!
-Well, where is he?

139
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:10,680
She was pretending she hasn't
heard from him in years...

140
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,817
...but l found this picture
on her fridge.

141
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,715
lsn't this what he would
look like now?

142
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:20,482
-Totally familiar.
-Oh, yeah!

143
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,288
Why would she lie to you?

144
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:25,862
We're having dinner tomorrow night,
so l figured she'll tell me then.

145
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,329
Maybe she just wanted
to give him time...

146
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,798
...to buy me presents.
l don't know.

147
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:34,496
-So you're all bored?
-Yes.

148
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:38,074
l'll close my eyes
and point to someone.

149
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:41,872
Whoever l point to has to come up with
something fun, and we have to do it.

150
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,345
Okay! Fan out! Fan out!

151
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,812
You know, we could just do this!

152
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:57,524
We all have to play strip poker?

153
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,896
Why, all of a sudden,
do you wanna play strip poker?

154
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:05,764
l think because of margaritas
three, four and nine.

155
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,669
Strip Happy Days Game?

156
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:16,143
l couldn't find cards, so it was this
or Strip Bag-of-old-knitting-stuff.

157
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:18,372
Done.

158
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:25,117
''Fonzie gives you two thumbs up.
Collect two cool points.''

159
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:29,854
lf you get five points, you get to make
someone take off one item of clothing.

160
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:32,622
lt hasn't happened yet,
but we're all very excited.

161
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,061
Okay, come on.

162
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:38,093
Daddy needs a new pair
of electromagnetic microscopes...

163
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,467
...for the Prehistoric Forensics
department.

164
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:50,515
Okay. ''Take Pinky Tuscadero
up to lnspiration Point.

165
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:52,946
Collect three cool points.''
Yeah!

166
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,949
Which gives me five.

167
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,214
And let's see, who is gonna
lose their clothes?

168
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:02,383
l think l pick our strip poker
sponsor, Mr. Joey Tribbiani.

169
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:08,396
All right, relax. lt's just a shoe.

170
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,504
''Your band is playing at Arnold's.
Collect three cool points.''

171
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:21,112
Which means l have five,
and that means l get Joey's boxers.

172
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,581
Fine. Gang up on me.

173
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:31,689
l got you all
right where l want you.

174
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,854
Come on! Take them off!

175
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,687
Actually, it's kind of cold.

176
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:39,331
How about l keep my boxers on
and give you a peek at the good stuff?

177
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,995
All right,
l'm gonna make more margaritas.

178
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,170
What are you doing?
Trying to get me drunk?

179
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,931
l'm just making margaritas.

180
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:51,101
Think l'll help her out.

181
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,905
-What is going on here?
-What?

182
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,584
-You're painting his toenails.
-Come on!

183
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:01,616
-Chasing him around the room.
-Please!

184
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,153
He's totally flirting with you too.

185
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,149
He is, isn't he?

186
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:11,788
l don't know. Maybe it's just
being here at the beach together...

187
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:14,056
...l don't know,
but it's like something--

188
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:21,563
-Hi, Bonnie.
-Hi.

189
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:24,641
My boss let me off early,
so l took the train.

190
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,209
What are you guys doing?

191
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,937
We're playing Strip Happy Days Game.

192
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:31,950
Cool! l'll catch up!

193
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,623
So you still don't think...

194
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:44,227
...l'm boyfriend material?

195
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:49,064
l saw you checking me out
during the game last night.

196
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:51,097
You didn't even
take off your pants.

197
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,635
Well, lucky for you.

198
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:56,033
-What?
-l don't know.

199
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:01,942
Well, is everybody else having
just the best time?

200
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,343
Joey's asleep.

201
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,524
After he passed out, we put the
sand around him to keep him warm.

202
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:24,229
Well, l assume the happy couple
isn't up yet?

203
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:26,666
Did you guys hear them last night?

204
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:28,703
l don't know what
they were doing, but...

205
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,240
...sea turtles actually
came up to the house.

206
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,646
Good morning.

207
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,440
-How'd everybody sleep?
-Great.

208
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:39,675
-Like a log.
-Us too.

209
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:42,988
l'm going for a walk.

210
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,562
Good morning.
Nice breasts by the way.

211
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,070
Hey, what happened to you?

212
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:07,712
Nothing. l just felt like
hanging out and reading.

213
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,510
The water was so great. We jumped
off this pier and my suit came off.

214
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:15,518
Sorry l missed that.

215
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:17,888
Joey and Chandler sure are funny.

216
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:22,717
l brought back half the beach
in my hair.

217
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:24,919
lt was so much easier
when l shaved my head.

218
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:32,166
You know, l gotta tell you...

219
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,169
...l just loved your look
when you were bald.

220
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:37,738
Really?

221
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:40,605
l think about shaving it
all off again sometimes.

222
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:42,773
-Really?
-Yeah.

223
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,078
You definitely should do that.

224
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,379
-You know what? l should do it!
-Yeah!

225
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:51,385
You know what? Thank you.
You are so cool.

226
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,683
Stop. Go on.

227
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,589
-Now go shave that head.
-All right.

228
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:07,531
-l know l've asked you this before.
-A hundred times before!

229
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:13,343
-How am l not right for you?
-l don't know.

230
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:15,479
l like guys like Richard.

231
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:18,411
Or Pete,
before he went insane.

232
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:21,643
l don't know.
Just somebody more mature.

233
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:24,379
So l'm not mature enough for you?

234
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,683
Monica needs somebody more mature.

235
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,633
What's the matter?

236
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:38,701
She canceled.
My namesake canceled on me.

237
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:42,340
She claims she had to go out of town
suddenly. She's avoiding me.

238
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:46,068
She doesn't want to tell me where my
father is. She knows but won't tell me!

239
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,439
Pheebs, that sucks.

240
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:52,414
Well, don't
''Pheebs, that sucks'' me yet.

241
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:56,045
-Where are you going?
-She's out of town.

242
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:59,850
There's gotta be something in her
house that tells me where my father is.

243
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,459
Some people call that
''breaking and entering.''

244
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:05,761
-Well, are any of those people here?
-No.

245
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:10,197
Okay. Look,
l'll do something nice, okay?

246
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,529
l'll fill her ice trays. Good?

247
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,504
Hey, everybody!

248
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,545
Look what you did!

249
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,842
-You wanna touch it?
-No, but it's great.

250
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:29,611
Come on, touch it.

251
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:37,359
You can feel all the bones
in your skull.

252
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:52,434
l was having a little chat
with Bonnie, and guess what?

253
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:57,138
She happened to bring up who was
behind the whole head-shaving idea.

254
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,113
And now, who was it?
That's right. lt was you!

255
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,252
That was her idea.

256
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,947
l just gave her a nudge.

257
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:09,684
She said you gave her the razor.

258
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:14,927
So anyone up for a midnight dip
in the ocean?

259
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,759
-No, l'm good.
-No, thanks.

260
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:19,494
-Okay, l'll see you in a bit.
-Okay, have fun.

261
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:25,070
Come on, see?
She doesn't look that bad.

262
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:28,542
You can see the moonlight
bouncing off her head!

263
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:32,575
-What the hell were you thinking?
-l don't know.

264
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,844
You don't know?
You balded my girlfriend!

265
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,146
All right.

266
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,526
Do you think it's easy for me
to see you with somebody else?

267
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,752
You're the one who ended it!
Remember?

268
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:47,955
Because l was mad at you!
Not because l stopped loving you!

269
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,996
-You still love me?
-No.

270
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:54,961
You still love me.

271
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,441
Yeah, so?
You love me.

272
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,239
What does this mean?

273
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:08,147
l mean, do you want
to get back together?

274
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:10,844
No! Maybe!

275
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,614
l don't know.

276
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:22,196
l still can't forgive you
for what you did.

277
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:25,336
l can't. But sometimes when
l'm with you, l just feel so....

278
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:26,862
What?

279
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:30,239
l just feel....

280
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,742
-l just--
-What?

281
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:35,180
l feel--

282
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,418
No! l don't care!

283
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:49,924
l'm not playing one-on-one strip poker
with you for practice!

284
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,256
But l made cards!

285
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:56,825
Good night.

286
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,269
l'm going upstairs.

287
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,234
-Good night.
-Good night.

288
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,910
Wanna play strip poker
for practice?

289
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:29,666
My ass!

290
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,207
No! lt's me! lt's me!

291
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:13,401
-l didn't wanna make any noise!
-Then don't break in!

292
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:17,772
-l'm sorry!
-What are you doing here?

293
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:21,946
l came to fill your ice-cube tray.

294
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,211
What?

295
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:29,823
Okay, look.

296
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:34,758
l took this picture from your fridge.
l know that this is my father.

297
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:38,334
This is Frank Buffay, and you were
standing next to him!

298
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:41,328
Now, look, l deserve
to know where l came from.

299
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,771
All right? So if you can help me
find my father, then you should.

300
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:47,138
Otherwise, you're just mean.

301
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:51,709
So just tell me the truth.

302
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,644
All right.

303
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:58,149
The man in that picture
is Chuck Mangione.

304
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:02,489
My father is Chuck Mangione?

305
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:05,094
No, no!
That's just Chuck Mangione.

306
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,663
l sold him a house last year.

307
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:11,962
And l'm very sorry, but l really
don't know where your father is.

308
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,967
And that's the truth.

309
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,508
But you're right.

310
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:22,071
l think that a person should know
where they come from.

311
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:25,282
Which is why l....

312
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,957
l'm your mother.

313
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,932
l wanted to tell you
yesterday, but l just...

314
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,763
...felt all floopy, and....

315
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,169
You guys are totally
getting back together.

316
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:53,810
That's not true. She doesn't
even know what she wants.

317
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:55,946
Rachel's still mad
about the whole thing.

318
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,379
Then you gotta back away.
You don't need that kind of hurt.

319
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:01,484
Take it from a guy who's...

320
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:04,986
...never had a long-term relationship.

321
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:10,285
l know, but l really want to go
up there and finish that kiss.

322
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:15,064
The water is great.
You should go in.

323
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,565
No, thanks. l just had an M&M.

324
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:19,999
Okay.
Well, good night.

325
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:21,638
Good night.

326
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:25,634
-Don't be too long.
-Okey-dokey.

327
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:29,246
There is not one hair
on that head.

328
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:34,010
lt'll grow back, right?
And she's really fun, and she's cool.

329
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:36,119
And l'm finally moving on.

330
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:38,949
Getting over Rachel was so....

331
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:43,093
l'm finally feeling sane.
And if l go up there...

332
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:45,263
...and l kiss her....

333
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:48,024
God, l want to kiss her!

334
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:52,101
And it doesn't work out, do l wanna
put myself through that again?

335
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:53,669
Let me get this straight.

336
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:58,832
lf you go with Bonnie, you're doing the
smart, healthy thing and moving on.

337
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:02,445
Right? And if you go with Rachel,
Bonnie's free tonight?

338
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:27,271
Hi there.

339
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:31,472
That's that weird voice again.

340
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:32,973
Okay.
Let me try it again.

341
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:36,579
You're gonna wanna date this next guy,
l swear! Okay, come on.

342
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,955
l can only do it
with the voice now.

343
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:47,455
Okay, okay.
Close the door!

344
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:53,631
Hi, l'm Dorf!

345
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,860
Your date for the evening.

346
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,769
Dorf on dating?
That's good stuff!
