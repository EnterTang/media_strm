1
00:00:06,086 --> 00:00:09,180
Welcome, everybody!
Welcome to Amazing Discoveries!

2
00:00:10,624 --> 00:00:11,852
It's on again!

3
00:00:12,092 --> 00:00:14,424
Guys, could we please
not watch this?

4
00:00:15,195 --> 00:00:18,460
This ever happen to you?
You go to get a glass of milk...

5
00:00:18,665 --> 00:00:21,964
...but these cartons are so
flinging, flanging hard to open!

6
00:00:22,169 --> 00:00:24,034
Boy, you said it, Mike.

7
00:00:26,707 --> 00:00:30,040
- There's gotta be a better way.
- There is, Kevin!

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,809
- Can we please turn this off?
- No way, Kevin!

9
00:00:34,014 --> 00:00:37,609
What if I told you there's
a new product that guarantees...

10
00:00:37,851 --> 00:00:40,718
...you'll never have to open up
milk cartons again?

11
00:00:41,021 --> 00:00:43,216
Meet the Milkmaster 2000!

12
00:00:45,459 --> 00:00:48,121
- Intrigued?
- You're flinging, flanging right I am!

13
00:00:49,796 --> 00:00:54,324
This is the first time he's used this.
You'll see how easy this is to do.

14
00:00:55,235 --> 00:00:58,261
- This works in any milk carton.
- Wow, it is easy!

15
00:00:58,472 --> 00:01:00,872
Now I can have milk every day.

16
00:01:03,276 --> 00:01:05,369
I can't watch this anymore.

17
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:08,173
You've suffered enough.
We'll change it.

18
00:01:08,382 --> 00:01:13,479
- How many times has this happened?
- There's gotta be a better way!

19
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:21,325
The One With the Metaphorical Tunnel

20
00:02:04,337 --> 00:02:06,931
It's official.
There are no good movies.

21
00:02:07,107 --> 00:02:09,940
So let's go to a bad one,
and make out.

22
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,774
Perhaps you'd like me to turn so you
can bunny-bump against my back?

23
00:02:21,388 --> 00:02:24,482
- Hey, man. What's up?
- Maybe you can tell me.

24
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:28,320
My agent wants to know why I didn't
show up at my audition today...

25
00:02:28,595 --> 00:02:31,928
...my first good one in weeks. How
could you not give me the message?

26
00:02:32,365 --> 00:02:35,027
I'll tell you, I do enjoy guilt...

27
00:02:35,602 --> 00:02:37,297
...but it wasn't me.

28
00:02:37,504 --> 00:02:40,166
Yes, it was.
It was him!

29
00:02:41,174 --> 00:02:42,732
Okay, it was me!

30
00:02:44,778 --> 00:02:48,270
- How was it you?
- Well, it was all so crazy, you know?

31
00:02:48,515 --> 00:02:51,382
Chandler was in the closet,
counting to 10...

32
00:02:51,651 --> 00:02:54,814
...and I hadn't found a place
to hide yet.

33
00:02:55,055 --> 00:02:59,492
I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all
down on my hand. See? All of it.

34
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,791
Yep, that's my audition.

35
00:03:01,995 --> 00:03:04,896
See? Now, this is why I keep
notepads everywhere.

36
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:08,898
Yep. And that's why we don't
invite you to play.

37
00:03:09,102 --> 00:03:12,663
What is the great tragedy here?
Get yourself another appointment.

38
00:03:12,873 --> 00:03:16,866
Estelle tried. The casting director
told her I missed my chance.

39
00:03:17,077 --> 00:03:18,305
Well, that is unfair!

40
00:03:18,578 --> 00:03:21,172
I'll call her.
I'll tell her it was my fault.

41
00:03:21,381 --> 00:03:24,316
You can't. The casting director
doesn't talk to friends.

42
00:03:24,518 --> 00:03:27,783
- She only talks to agents.
- What a sad little life she must lead.

43
00:03:31,491 --> 00:03:34,324
- What are you doing?
- No, I know, I know.

44
00:03:35,662 --> 00:03:39,029
Hi, this is Caitlin
from Phoebe Buffay's office.

45
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,728
Is Anne there for Phoebe?

46
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:45,228
She'll know what it's about.

47
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:46,928
Hang up. Hang up right...

48
00:03:48,942 --> 00:03:52,537
Annie? Hi. Listen, we've got
a problem with Joey Tribbiani.

49
00:03:52,746 --> 00:03:56,238
Apparently, he missed his audition.
Who did you speak to in my office?

50
00:03:56,516 --> 00:03:58,609
Estelle? I don't know
what to do with her.

51
00:03:58,852 --> 00:04:03,152
So your husband leaves and burns down
the apartment. The world doesn't stop.

52
00:04:04,357 --> 00:04:05,915
Is anybody else scared?

53
00:04:07,527 --> 00:04:11,429
If Joey loses this audition, then
that is it for Estelle. I don't care!

54
00:04:12,432 --> 00:04:16,232
Annie, you are a doll. What time can
you see him? I need a pen. Pen!

55
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:26,804
Get the woman a pad!
Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!

56
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,976
Oh, now you want a pad.

57
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:41,984
That's funny. Ugly Naked Guy's naked,
but his dog's wearing a sweater.

58
00:04:45,665 --> 00:04:46,825
Hey!

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,934
Where's my boy?

60
00:04:49,102 --> 00:04:51,195
Here's my boy!

61
00:04:51,371 --> 00:04:55,398
And here's his Barbie!

62
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,575
What's my boy doing with a Barbie?

63
00:05:03,516 --> 00:05:06,144
He picked it out at the store.
He loves it.

64
00:05:06,353 --> 00:05:08,878
He carries it everywhere,
like a security blanket.

65
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:11,783
But with ski boots and a kicky beret.

66
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:14,956
Yeah, it's cute.

67
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:17,994
Why does he have it again?

68
00:05:18,231 --> 00:05:21,496
So he's got a doll. So what?

69
00:05:22,002 --> 00:05:25,494
Unless you're afraid
he's gonna grow up to be...

70
00:05:25,772 --> 00:05:27,535
...in show business.

71
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,009
This wouldn't have
to do with the fact...

72
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,235
...that he's being raised
by two women?

73
00:05:33,747 --> 00:05:38,810
You know what? It's fine. If you're
okay with the Barbie thing, so am I.

74
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:42,284
Give Daddy the Barbie.
Give me the Barbie.

75
00:05:42,489 --> 00:05:45,856
Don't you wanna play
with a monster truck?

76
00:05:46,793 --> 00:05:48,090
No? Okay.

77
00:05:48,728 --> 00:05:52,425
How about a Dino-Soldier?

78
00:05:56,736 --> 00:05:58,260
You are so pathetic.

79
00:05:58,471 --> 00:06:02,032
Why can't your son
just play with his doll?

80
00:06:08,081 --> 00:06:09,708
I gotta go to work.

81
00:06:11,418 --> 00:06:13,249
Has anybody seen my left boob?

82
00:06:15,121 --> 00:06:17,555
I loved that movie.

83
00:06:20,894 --> 00:06:23,055
Here it is.
What are you doing?

84
00:06:23,663 --> 00:06:25,961
I'm sorry. It just felt nice.

85
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:30,963
Answer the phone.

86
00:06:31,404 --> 00:06:35,500
I only got one arm. You should
do stuff for me. Get me a sweater.

87
00:06:36,476 --> 00:06:38,000
Just do it! It's Janice.

88
00:06:38,278 --> 00:06:41,213
And if I get it, I'll have
to see her tonight.

89
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:45,441
That's great.
I'll have to see her tonight.

90
00:06:45,652 --> 00:06:47,916
Why don't you want to see Janice?

91
00:06:48,121 --> 00:06:50,089
Last night at dinner,
when the meals came...

92
00:06:50,323 --> 00:06:55,260
...she put half her chicken piccata
on my plate and took all my tomatoes.

93
00:06:56,996 --> 00:06:58,987
And that's bad...

94
00:06:59,299 --> 00:07:01,790
...because you hate chicken piccata?

95
00:07:03,603 --> 00:07:08,131
You didn't want to share your tomatoes.
Tomatoes are very important to you.

96
00:07:08,341 --> 00:07:10,104
Suddenly, we were this "couple."

97
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,835
And this alarm started going off
in my head.

98
00:07:13,146 --> 00:07:15,478
"Run for your life!
Get out of the building!"

99
00:07:17,517 --> 00:07:21,647
Men are unbelievable. Janice thought
she was giving you chicken.

100
00:07:21,821 --> 00:07:25,086
She didn't think she was giving you
scary chicken.

101
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:26,815
What is it with you people?

102
00:07:27,127 --> 00:07:29,925
The minute you feel something,
you have to run away?

103
00:07:30,296 --> 00:07:32,389
I know. That...

104
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:38,199
That's why I don't want to go tonight.
I'm afraid I'll say something stupid.

105
00:07:38,471 --> 00:07:41,634
You mean that "guy thing" where
you act mean and distant...

106
00:07:41,841 --> 00:07:43,536
...until we break up with you?

107
00:07:43,743 --> 00:07:44,937
You know about that?

108
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,507
What do I do?
I wanna get past this.

109
00:07:48,782 --> 00:07:51,046
I don't want to be afraid
of commitment.

110
00:07:51,284 --> 00:07:54,651
I want to go through the tunnel
to the other side!

111
00:07:55,488 --> 00:07:58,787
Where there's no fear of commitment.

112
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:01,250
Do we have any...

113
00:08:05,165 --> 00:08:06,928
Do we have any thoughts here?

114
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:10,031
I've never been through
the tunnel myself because...

115
00:08:10,303 --> 00:08:13,602
...you're not allowed through
with more than one girl in the car.

116
00:08:15,842 --> 00:08:20,245
But it seems to me it's pretty much
like anything else. Face your fear.

117
00:08:20,513 --> 00:08:23,414
Fear of heights?
Go to the top of the building.

118
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,675
You're afraid of bugs.

119
00:08:25,985 --> 00:08:27,418
Get a bug.

120
00:08:30,223 --> 00:08:32,088
You have a fear of commitment.

121
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:36,659
So I say you go in there and you be
the most committed guy there ever was!

122
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:39,127
Amazingly, that makes sense.

123
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:43,096
- Do you think?
- Oh, yeah! Go for it, man!

124
00:08:43,336 --> 00:08:44,428
Jump off the high dive!

125
00:08:44,704 --> 00:08:48,401
Stare down the barrel of the gun!
Pee into the wind!

126
00:08:50,109 --> 00:08:52,543
If I'm staring down
the barrel of a gun...

127
00:08:52,745 --> 00:08:55,942
...I'm gonna be pretty much peeing
every which way.

128
00:09:00,453 --> 00:09:03,115
Listen to this and tell me
what you think.

129
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:08,423
That's interesting.

130
00:09:09,596 --> 00:09:12,656
- Honey?
- Oh, because it's a beeper.

131
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:17,635
It's your audition from this morning!
Can I use the phone?

132
00:09:17,837 --> 00:09:22,740
Sure, that's what it's there for.
Emergencies and pretend agents.

133
00:09:23,243 --> 00:09:25,575
Come on, baby! Come on!

134
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,043
Hi. I have Phoebe Buffay
returning a page.

135
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,811
Okay, she's in her car.
I'll have to patch you through.

136
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,681
Very nice touch.

137
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,289
Okay, go ahead.

138
00:09:39,726 --> 00:09:41,751
Talk, talk, talk!

139
00:09:42,262 --> 00:09:43,786
Hi, Annie?

140
00:09:43,963 --> 00:09:45,453
Fantastic. You got it!

141
00:09:48,301 --> 00:09:52,965
Will he work for scale, you ask me?
Well, I don't know about that.

142
00:09:53,172 --> 00:09:55,367
Except that I do and he will.

143
00:09:55,742 --> 00:09:58,210
Great. Oh, you are such a sweetheart.

144
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:03,815
I would love to have lunch with you!
How about we have lunch next...

145
00:10:04,017 --> 00:10:06,008
Went through a tunnel.

146
00:10:06,219 --> 00:10:07,379
Unbelievable.

147
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,383
Oh, thank you so much!

148
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:14,087
It was really fun. I mean, I've never
talked on a car phone before.

149
00:10:14,928 --> 00:10:17,795
You are so amazing!
Could you do me this huge favor?

150
00:10:18,064 --> 00:10:21,431
There's another audition I want,
and Estelle couldn't get me in.

151
00:10:21,634 --> 00:10:24,125
I don't know.
It was fun one time, but...

152
00:10:24,337 --> 00:10:26,828
Please? It would just be
this one more.

153
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,768
- Well, actually it's two.
- Two?

154
00:10:29,976 --> 00:10:35,915
Well, really it's three. Please?
You're so good at it. I love you.

155
00:10:36,482 --> 00:10:39,883
- Okay. But just these three, right?
- No, it's four.

156
00:10:44,324 --> 00:10:46,485
So how come you wanted
to eat in tonight?

157
00:10:47,093 --> 00:10:49,459
Because I wanted...

158
00:10:49,662 --> 00:10:51,653
...to give you this.

159
00:10:52,598 --> 00:10:56,193
Are you a puppy!

160
00:10:59,772 --> 00:11:01,239
Contact paper!

161
00:11:02,775 --> 00:11:05,710
What do you say when someone
you're sleeping with...

162
00:11:05,979 --> 00:11:07,537
...gives you contact paper?

163
00:11:08,214 --> 00:11:12,708
Wait, there's more.
See, the contact paper is to go...

164
00:11:12,986 --> 00:11:15,580
...in your brand new drawer!

165
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:20,056
See, the drawer actually
goes in my dresser.

166
00:11:21,094 --> 00:11:25,292
- You didn't have to do this.
- Yes, I did.

167
00:11:25,465 --> 00:11:28,093
Yes, I did.
Because you're my girlfriend...

168
00:11:28,334 --> 00:11:31,235
...and that's what girlfriends
should get.

169
00:11:33,172 --> 00:11:35,697
Well, I gotta buy a vowel...

170
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:41,010
...because, oh, my God!

171
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,578
Who would've thought that someday...

172
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,719
...Chandler Bing would buy me
a drawer?

173
00:11:47,954 --> 00:11:50,149
Well, not me.

174
00:11:50,923 --> 00:11:54,188
But that's what's happened.
And there's more.

175
00:11:56,229 --> 00:11:58,060
We should take a trip.

176
00:11:58,698 --> 00:11:59,687
We should?

177
00:11:59,966 --> 00:12:02,696
We're a couple,
and that's what couples do.

178
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:05,237
And I wanna meet your parents.

179
00:12:05,438 --> 00:12:08,464
We should take a trip
with your parents!

180
00:12:12,445 --> 00:12:17,849
I don't think we need to because
you're tripping me out right now!

181
00:12:18,017 --> 00:12:20,349
- Are you okay?
- No, I am.

182
00:12:20,887 --> 00:12:22,787
I actually am! This is amazing.

183
00:12:23,056 --> 00:12:26,389
My entire life, I have feared
this place.

184
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:29,858
And now that I'm here, it's like,
what was the big deal?

185
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:33,430
I could probably say, "Let's move in
together," and I'd be okay.

186
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,233
You probably want us
to move in together?

187
00:12:37,403 --> 00:12:40,463
- It doesn't scare me!
- Yeah, well it scares me!

188
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,506
I'm not even divorced yet! You just
invited me over here for pasta...

189
00:12:44,777 --> 00:12:47,837
...and now you're talking
about moving in together.

190
00:12:48,114 --> 00:12:49,809
And I wasn't even that hungry.

191
00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:54,313
You know what? It's getting really
late, and I should just...

192
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,284
Don't go! I've scared you!
I've said too much!

193
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:01,153
I'm hopeless and awkward
and desperate for love!

194
00:13:07,767 --> 00:13:09,632
Hey, Janice, it's me.

195
00:13:10,937 --> 00:13:15,465
I wanted to apologize in advance for
having chased you down the street.

196
00:13:24,183 --> 00:13:26,481
Here you go, honey. This will help.

197
00:13:27,286 --> 00:13:29,277
So I catch up to her
and she says...

198
00:13:29,522 --> 00:13:32,980
...this relationship's going too fast
and we have to slow down.

199
00:13:33,192 --> 00:13:34,989
That is never good.

200
00:13:35,194 --> 00:13:36,354
Then I got all...

201
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,798
...needy and clingy.

202
00:13:40,433 --> 00:13:44,733
- You didn't beg, did you?
- I said please.

203
00:13:44,937 --> 00:13:48,930
Was it please with one E
in the middle or lots of E's?

204
00:13:49,442 --> 00:13:51,137
Oh, dear Lord, I begged.

205
00:13:52,044 --> 00:13:55,411
Wait a minute. Maybe it's
not so bad. How did you leave it?

206
00:13:55,615 --> 00:13:57,014
She said she'd call me.

207
00:13:59,785 --> 00:14:01,616
Oh, God.

208
00:14:01,787 --> 00:14:04,620
Welcome to our side of the tunnel.

209
00:14:05,057 --> 00:14:08,049
This ice cream tastes like crap,
by the way.

210
00:14:08,227 --> 00:14:11,788
Yeah, well, it's that
low-cal-nondairy-soymilk junk.

211
00:14:12,031 --> 00:14:14,499
We save the real stuff
for the truly terminal cases.

212
00:14:15,468 --> 00:14:18,926
When you're getting screwed over all
the time, you gotta switch to low fat.

213
00:14:19,138 --> 00:14:20,969
Yeah, you do.

214
00:14:21,841 --> 00:14:23,809
You don't think I'm terminal?

215
00:14:23,976 --> 00:14:28,276
Not at all. You're not terminal.
We just need some damage control.

216
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:31,973
- Okay. Should I call her?
- No!

217
00:14:32,985 --> 00:14:36,887
Very critical time. If you feel
yourself reaching for that phone...

218
00:14:37,123 --> 00:14:39,557
...go shopping, get your butt
in a bubble bath.

219
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:43,354
If you want her back,
you have got to start acting aloof.

220
00:14:44,063 --> 00:14:46,122
Aloof?

221
00:14:47,767 --> 00:14:50,201
She needs to know you're not needy.

222
00:14:50,403 --> 00:14:55,136
So what you have to do is accidentally
run into her on purpose...

223
00:14:55,308 --> 00:14:57,276
...and then act aloof.

224
00:14:58,377 --> 00:15:01,141
- And then I'll be okay?
- Yeah. I think so.

225
00:15:02,615 --> 00:15:04,606
So I'm not gonna lose her?

226
00:15:04,784 --> 00:15:07,912
Oh, honey, you're not a total loser.

227
00:15:11,157 --> 00:15:13,921
I said, "So I'm not gonna lose her?"

228
00:15:21,367 --> 00:15:22,629
Guess who's here!

229
00:15:22,868 --> 00:15:25,837
It's the toughest guy in Toyland, Ben!

230
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:29,998
Real American hero
I'm G.I. Joe!

231
00:15:30,176 --> 00:15:32,542
Drop the Barbie. Drop the Barbie.

232
00:15:32,745 --> 00:15:36,306
G.I. Joe?
You really think he'll fall for that?

233
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:40,942
G.I. Joe?
Cool! Can I play?

234
00:15:42,655 --> 00:15:46,284
Look, Ben! It's a toy that protects
U.S. Oil interests overseas!

235
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:48,791
Go, Joe!

236
00:15:49,795 --> 00:15:51,160
Hello?

237
00:15:51,364 --> 00:15:53,559
- There you are!
- No, it's not. Sorry.

238
00:15:53,766 --> 00:15:56,428
But, Phoebe, wait, wait.
Phoebe!

239
00:15:56,602 --> 00:15:59,935
Oh, Joey! Oh, okay!
See, I didn't recognize you...

240
00:16:00,206 --> 00:16:01,537
...in those pants.

241
00:16:03,276 --> 00:16:07,076
That TV movie I went in for, did you
hear anything? I think I got a shot.

242
00:16:07,913 --> 00:16:10,143
Yes, they called!
You didn't get it!

243
00:16:10,883 --> 00:16:14,649
Okay? I mean, you didn't get it.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

244
00:16:14,954 --> 00:16:17,320
That's okay. These things happen.

245
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:20,423
But they shouldn't happen.
You know what?

246
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,288
You're in a terrible,
terrible business.

247
00:16:23,996 --> 00:16:27,625
I don't want to be the person
who makes you look like that.

248
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,801
I'm okay. See?

249
00:16:31,637 --> 00:16:33,969
Now you're sad and creepy.

250
00:16:34,507 --> 00:16:36,065
I'm sorry. I quit.

251
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:40,711
No, no, you can't quit!
You're the best agent I ever had.

252
00:16:40,913 --> 00:16:44,440
Rejection is part of being an actor.
You can't take it personal.

253
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:49,144
They said they'd never met an Italian
actor with a worse Italian accent.

254
00:16:49,755 --> 00:16:51,347
They actually said that?

255
00:16:51,557 --> 00:16:55,516
Oh, God, there's that face again.
See? I can't do this job!

256
00:16:55,728 --> 00:16:59,255
This is why you have to do
this job! Agents always lie.

257
00:16:59,465 --> 00:17:02,434
Estelle just says stuff like,
"They went another way."

258
00:17:02,668 --> 00:17:04,465
But this? I can use this.

259
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:07,605
I can work on a new accent.

260
00:17:08,441 --> 00:17:11,774
Yeah, okay. If it
helps you, okay. Yeah.

261
00:17:11,977 --> 00:17:15,640
You'll never get me, Joe!

262
00:17:28,327 --> 00:17:30,227
No, thank you.

263
00:17:32,098 --> 00:17:36,501
- Chandler!
- Hello, Janice.

264
00:17:38,738 --> 00:17:40,535
What are you doing here?

265
00:17:41,173 --> 00:17:42,868
Just a bit of shopping.

266
00:17:43,142 --> 00:17:44,473
How have you been?

267
00:17:46,045 --> 00:17:48,070
Are you being British?

268
00:17:50,383 --> 00:17:51,714
Not anymore.

269
00:17:52,852 --> 00:17:55,980
Why are you shopping here?
You don't live in this neighborhood.

270
00:17:56,322 --> 00:17:58,722
Were you here waiting for me?

271
00:18:02,528 --> 00:18:03,620
I'm just...

272
00:18:04,163 --> 00:18:06,825
...picking up some things for a party.

273
00:18:08,768 --> 00:18:09,860
Barley?

274
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,863
What kind of party serves barley?

275
00:18:13,072 --> 00:18:16,166
I'm sorry if my friends aren't
as sophisticated as yours.

276
00:18:17,643 --> 00:18:20,168
- Where is this party?
- Here in Chelsea.

277
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:22,046
Whose party is it?

278
00:18:22,248 --> 00:18:23,374
A woman's.

279
00:18:23,582 --> 00:18:24,640
What woman?

280
00:18:26,085 --> 00:18:28,246
Chelsea.

281
00:18:29,321 --> 00:18:32,518
Either you're seeing somebody
behind my back...

282
00:18:32,725 --> 00:18:35,421
...which would make you
the world's biggest jerk...

283
00:18:35,628 --> 00:18:37,926
...or you're pretending
to see somebody...

284
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:41,691
...which makes you so pathetic
I could cry right here!

285
00:18:41,901 --> 00:18:45,393
So which of these two guys
do you want to be?

286
00:18:46,439 --> 00:18:48,202
Can I be that guy?

287
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:55,679
Okay, we got some more good
rejections. Lots of stuff to work on.

288
00:18:56,148 --> 00:18:57,274
Okay. Shoot.

289
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:01,111
- Okay. Oh, the zoo commercial.
- I didn't get it?

290
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,848
No. They said that you
"weren't believable as a human being."

291
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:08,784
So you can work on that.

292
00:19:09,795 --> 00:19:10,784
Great.

293
00:19:11,263 --> 00:19:12,252
What else?

294
00:19:12,565 --> 00:19:16,433
The off-Broadway-play people said
that you were "pretty but dumb."

295
00:19:16,602 --> 00:19:19,628
Oh, no wait. I'm sorry.
That's "pretty dumb."

296
00:19:19,905 --> 00:19:22,100
Look, it's okay, no, no, no.
Really.

297
00:19:22,341 --> 00:19:23,399
Look...

298
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:25,936
...I really appreciate this...

299
00:19:26,812 --> 00:19:29,076
...but I'm gonna have to
go back to Estelle.

300
00:19:29,949 --> 00:19:32,850
Don't get me wrong.
You're a better agent than she is...

301
00:19:33,152 --> 00:19:36,918
...but at least with her, I don't want
to blow my pretty dumb brains out.

302
00:19:38,123 --> 00:19:40,114
Yeah, no, I understand.

303
00:19:40,326 --> 00:19:41,793
You do? Thanks. Okay.

304
00:19:42,127 --> 00:19:43,116
Sorry.

305
00:19:46,966 --> 00:19:48,092
Wait a minute.

306
00:19:48,334 --> 00:19:49,596
Wait a minute.

307
00:19:49,835 --> 00:19:53,168
Did you make all that stuff up
to get out of being my agent?

308
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:54,804
Oh, he caught me.

309
00:19:57,209 --> 00:19:58,938
I am so busted!

310
00:20:00,145 --> 00:20:02,306
That's what I suspected!

311
00:20:05,718 --> 00:20:07,777
And then I just, you know...

312
00:20:08,654 --> 00:20:11,953
...threw the bag of barley at her
and ran out of the store.

313
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:16,324
My God, Chandler, we said be "aloof,"
not "a doof."

314
00:20:17,997 --> 00:20:20,830
I've actually ruined this, haven't I?

315
00:20:22,401 --> 00:20:24,926
Is it time for the good ice cream now?

316
00:20:25,938 --> 00:20:27,633
- It's time.
- Yeah, it is.

317
00:20:30,776 --> 00:20:33,472
Everything's gonna be okay.
You know why?

318
00:20:33,646 --> 00:20:37,946
Because you got 65 grams of fat
coming your way.

319
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:43,447
Hello? Hi, Janice.

320
00:20:44,523 --> 00:20:47,253
Can you hold on for a second?
Okay.

321
00:20:47,459 --> 00:20:49,484
Okay. What do I do?

322
00:20:49,695 --> 00:20:51,663
I don't know.
This is unprecedented.

323
00:20:51,864 --> 00:20:54,492
If we did what you did,
a man would never call.

324
00:20:55,267 --> 00:20:58,725
I got it! Pretend you just woke up.
That'll throw her off!

325
00:20:58,938 --> 00:21:01,270
- Be sleepy!
- Yes! And grumpy!

326
00:21:01,473 --> 00:21:04,101
What are you...?
Stop naming dwarfs!

327
00:21:06,845 --> 00:21:09,075
Hello, Janice? Hi.

328
00:21:09,248 --> 00:21:11,910
I'm so glad that you called.

329
00:21:13,118 --> 00:21:17,521
I know I've been acting
really weird lately...

330
00:21:18,857 --> 00:21:21,883
...and it's just because
I'm crazy about you...

331
00:21:24,697 --> 00:21:28,861
...and I just got stupid and scared...

332
00:21:29,068 --> 00:21:31,036
...and stupid a couple more times.

333
00:21:32,137 --> 00:21:33,126
And I'm sorry.

334
00:21:34,707 --> 00:21:35,696
Really?

335
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:38,868
Really?

336
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:42,206
He's so lucky.
If Janice were a guy...

337
00:21:42,381 --> 00:21:45,612
...she'd be sleeping
with somebody else by now.

338
00:21:46,585 --> 00:21:47,950
I love you too.

339
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,844
It's so unfair!

340
00:21:57,896 --> 00:21:59,921
G.I. Joe? G.I. Joe?!

341
00:22:00,099 --> 00:22:04,195
I don't know what to tell you guys.
That's the doll he chose.

342
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,995
What'd you do, dip it in sugar?

343
00:22:07,206 --> 00:22:09,401
Look, G.I. Joe's in, Barbie's out.

344
00:22:09,608 --> 00:22:13,601
And if you guys can't deal with it,
that's just your too bad.

345
00:22:15,114 --> 00:22:18,948
What are you being such a weenie for?
So he has a Barbie. Big deal.

346
00:22:19,184 --> 00:22:21,414
You used to dress up like a woman.

347
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:29,190
What?

348
00:22:29,395 --> 00:22:31,761
The way you used to dress up
in Mom's clothes?

349
00:22:31,964 --> 00:22:33,693
What are you talking about?

350
00:22:33,932 --> 00:22:37,163
The big hat, the pearls,
the little pink handbag?

351
00:22:37,336 --> 00:22:39,804
Okay. You are totally
making this up.

352
00:22:40,172 --> 00:22:42,003
How can you not remember?

353
00:22:42,274 --> 00:22:44,208
You made us call you "Bea"?

354
00:22:50,716 --> 00:22:52,809
Oh, God.

355
00:22:53,152 --> 00:22:56,610
I've literally never been this happy.

356
00:22:56,889 --> 00:22:59,016
Wasn't there a little song?

357
00:22:59,224 --> 00:23:01,624
Oh, please, God,
let there be a song.

358
00:23:01,827 --> 00:23:03,852
There was no song.
There was no song.

359
00:23:04,063 --> 00:23:05,587
- I am Bea
- Okay.

360
00:23:05,964 --> 00:23:07,625
- I drink tea...
- That's enough.

361
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,299
Won't you?

362
00:23:10,402 --> 00:23:11,733
Won't you?

363
00:23:12,805 --> 00:23:14,238
Won't you?

364
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:18,302
Won't you dance around with me?

365
00:23:23,949 --> 00:23:26,474
I am Bea

366
00:23:26,652 --> 00:23:29,348
I drink tea

367
00:23:29,521 --> 00:23:34,982
Won't you dance around with...?

368
00:23:42,468 --> 00:23:43,457
Ross!

369
00:23:47,139 --> 00:23:48,128
