1
00:00:02,416 --> 00:00:05,852
会不会有哪个地方有个城镇
Do you think there's a town in Missouri or someplace...

2
00:00:06,086 --> 00:00:07,485
名叫“样本”？
...called Sample?

3
00:00:07,688 --> 00:00:11,590
当你开车去那里 标志上会写着
And as you're driving into the town, there's a sign and it says:

4
00:00:11,858 --> 00:00:13,917
“你在样本里”
''You're in Sample.''

5
00:00:18,165 --> 00:00:20,156
你跟彼特怎样了？ 快说
-How did it go with Pete? -Tell us.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,698
你们一定不会相信，我去…
You're not gonna believe this. So l go--

7
00:00:22,936 --> 00:00:24,904
很抱歉
l'm sorry. Excuse us.

8
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:31,177
店里有点挤，可以一起坐吗？ 挪一下
-lt's a little crowded. Do you mind? -Could you skooch?

9
00:00:31,578 --> 00:00:33,205
稍微挪一下
Move over just a little bit.

10
00:00:34,614 --> 00:00:35,945
再挪
lKeep on skooching.

11
00:00:37,451 --> 00:00:40,978
总之我去找他，然后…
So, guys, listen. l go over there and, you know, l'm--

12
00:00:41,221 --> 00:00:43,212
为什么？我哪里不好？
Why? What is wrong with me?

13
00:00:43,423 --> 00:00:45,254
怎么了？ 提姆
-What's the matter? -Tim...

14
00:00:45,525 --> 00:00:47,254
我有一种感觉
...l have a feeling...

15
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:51,227
我老婆和她的妇科医生有一腿
...my wife is sleeping with her gynecologist.

16
00:00:54,067 --> 00:00:55,329
你怎么知道？
How do you know?

17
00:00:55,569 --> 00:00:57,059
他有管道 我知道
-He's got access. -l know.

18
00:00:59,172 --> 00:01:00,639
我就是感觉得到
lt's a feeling you get.

19
00:01:00,974 --> 00:01:03,238
就像穿到别人的保龄球鞋？
Like when you're in somebody else's bowling shoes?

20
00:01:03,443 --> 00:01:04,410
没错
That's the one.

21
00:01:06,012 --> 00:01:08,378
你去了彼特家 然后呢？
-So you went to Pete's. -What happened?

22
00:01:08,648 --> 00:01:11,014
我为什么这么倒霉？
Why is this happening to me?

23
00:01:11,218 --> 00:01:12,742
也许是我的伤口害的
Maybe it's my wound.

24
00:01:13,253 --> 00:01:14,117
算了
Forget it.

25
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:17,422
你的伤还没好？
lt's not healed yet?

26
00:01:17,657 --> 00:01:19,022
它一直在渗血
lt's oozing!

27
00:01:19,526 --> 00:01:21,960
请把奶精给我…在那边
Would you pass the cream? There's the cream.

28
00:01:22,195 --> 00:01:23,628
谢谢你
Thank you very much.

29
00:01:24,698 --> 00:01:28,634
汤玛斯，我想亲口告诉你
Tomas, this is gonna be hard, but l wanted it to come from me.

30
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:31,599
什么事？ 是我跟你老婆有一腿
-What is it? -l've been sleeping with your wife.

31
00:01:31,805 --> 00:01:32,829
你是她的妇科医生？
You're the gynecologist?

32
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,802
我在谈私事
l'm trying to have a private conversation.

33
00:01:37,577 --> 00:01:40,478
我要纸巾，请拿给我
Can l have a napkin? Could you please hand me a napkin?

34
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,046
拿来啦！
Just give me the thing, all right?

35
00:01:44,518 --> 00:01:45,416
够了
Enough!

36
00:01:45,652 --> 00:01:47,984
你不是我的朋友了
And you are no longer my friend!

37
00:01:48,221 --> 00:01:50,189
我们恩断义绝！一刀两断！
We are finished! Nada! No more!

38
00:01:50,457 --> 00:01:52,391
你竟然做这种事
You are a bastard for doing that!

39
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:54,126
离我远一点
Stay away from me!

40
00:01:54,995 --> 00:01:55,962
你回来
Come back!

41
00:02:04,404 --> 00:02:07,202
你刚才要说什么？
So what were you gonna tell us?

42
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:09,368
我忘了
l have no idea.

43
00:02:11,678 --> 00:02:13,873

45
00:03:00,861 --> 00:03:03,489
彼特想告诉你什么大消息？
What was the big news Pete wanted to tell you?

46
00:03:03,763 --> 00:03:05,993
我该叫你摩妮卡贝克太太吗？
Or should l say, ''Mrs. Monica Becker''?

47
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,132
保留你的姓，不要冠他的姓
Oh, keep your name. Don't take his name.

48
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:11,494
他没有向我求婚
He didn't ask me to marry him.

49
00:03:11,738 --> 00:03:14,172
那绝对不要冠他的姓
Then definitely don't take his name!

50
00:03:15,675 --> 00:03:19,133
他要参加一个什么…
He wanted to tell me he's going to compete in some Ultimate...

51
00:03:19,346 --> 00:03:21,143
终极格斗比赛
...Fighting Competition thingy.

52
00:03:21,348 --> 00:03:23,680
彼特？ 那是什么？
-Pete? -Why? What is it?

53
00:03:23,984 --> 00:03:26,509
我也不清楚，有点像摔角
l don't know exactly. lt's sort of like wrestling.

54
00:03:27,854 --> 00:03:29,719
但不用穿表演服
But without the costumes.

55
00:03:31,024 --> 00:03:33,151
那是玩真的，非常野蛮
And it's not fake. lt's totally brutal.

56
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:37,658
两个人在场中厮杀 规则是…没有规则
lt's two guys in the ring and the rules are, ''There are no rules''!

57
00:03:38,532 --> 00:03:41,023
可以咬人、扯别人的头发？
You can bite and pull people's hair and stuff?

58
00:03:41,334 --> 00:03:44,565
都可以，除了戳眼睛和鱼钩手
Anything goes except eye-gouging and fish-hooking.

59
00:03:44,838 --> 00:03:47,238
什么是鱼钩手？ 就是…
-What's fish-hooking? -What's fish-hook--

60
00:03:49,876 --> 00:03:52,845
谢了，不然还真难形容
Thanks. That would have been hard to describe.

61
00:03:53,213 --> 00:03:54,703
什么味道？
What is that taste?

62
00:03:55,415 --> 00:03:58,907
我的手很干净 我刚帮鸭子洗完澡
My hands are totally clean. l just gave the duck a bath.

63
00:04:02,822 --> 00:04:04,312
谢谢各位的热烈欢迎
Thanks for the warm welcome.

64
00:04:04,591 --> 00:04:09,028
很高兴有各位的加入 我要大展身手，希望你们也是
lt's good to have you guys on my team. l come to play. l hope you do too.

65
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:11,697
去给他们好看吧，记住
Let's go out there and get them! And remember:

66
00:04:11,965 --> 00:04:14,490
团队当中没有个人
There is no ''l'' in ''team.''

67
00:04:14,768 --> 00:04:18,727
酒后不认帐，回我那里去吧
Yes, but there's two in ''martini.'' So, everybody, back to my office.

68
00:04:19,773 --> 00:04:22,606
那个嬉皮笑脸的，你叫什么？
You! Chuckles. What's your name?

69
00:04:22,876 --> 00:04:24,935
我是宾，很抱歉，我只是…
lt's Bing, sir. l'm sorry. l was just....

70
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:28,544
我听到你说的话了 很有趣，我喜欢
No, no. l heard what you said. Funny. l like funny.

71
00:04:28,915 --> 00:04:31,713
我们要努力，也要尽兴
This team's about hard work, but it's also about having fun.

72
00:04:31,952 --> 00:04:33,943
很高兴有你加入，宾
Good to have you aboard, Bing!

73
00:04:41,194 --> 00:04:42,684
对，瑞德
That's right. Ryder.

74
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,762
薇诺娜瑞德要订六个位子
Winona Ryder for six.

75
00:04:48,435 --> 00:04:49,402
谢谢
Thank you.

76
00:04:49,636 --> 00:04:51,900
订到位子了
Yeah. We have the reservations.

77
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,607
干得好
All right, buddy! Way to go!

78
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,675
老兄，你干什么？
Dude, what are you doing?

79
00:04:59,312 --> 00:05:03,715
说得好，我上司一直拍我屁股 还一脸不在乎
Thank you. My boss keeps slapping my butt, and acting like it's no big deal.

80
00:05:03,917 --> 00:05:05,475
那你怎么办？
What'd you do about it?

81
00:05:05,652 --> 00:05:08,485
没怎么办，我不想当…
l didn't do anything. l didn't want to be the guy...

82
00:05:08,655 --> 00:05:11,556
对上司拍屁股有意见的人
...who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.

83
00:05:12,392 --> 00:05:15,725
我觉得当那个人无所谓
l gotta tell you, l think it's okay to be that guy.

84
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,163
也许他在学运动员
Maybe it's that jock thing.

85
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:22,128
足球员达阵之后 都会拍来拍去
You know, how football players pat each other after touchdowns.

86
00:05:24,471 --> 00:05:26,598
我实在不了解男人
You know, l don't understand guys.

87
00:05:26,873 --> 00:05:30,309
我要称赞摩妮卡煮的炖菜好吃
l mean, l would never congratulate Monica on a great stew...

88
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,774
也不会去捉她的咪咪
...by, you know, grabbing her boob.

89
00:05:34,581 --> 00:05:36,776
如果真的很好吃
l know. For a really great stew, you'd just...

90
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,813
应该直接把脸埋进去
...stick your head in between them.

91
00:05:40,553 --> 00:05:41,952
可以吃饭了吗？
Can we please go eat?

92
00:05:42,188 --> 00:05:45,282
要吃什么？ 不要吃炖菜就好
-Yeah, what are we getting? -Anything but stew.

93
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:49,784
从今以后 别让你的上司逮到机会
So from now on, don't give your boss a chance to get you.

94
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,759
别把背部对着他
Don't turn your back to him.

95
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:54,924
你也可以给他一个教训
Or you could teach him a lesson, you know?

96
00:05:55,201 --> 00:05:59,763
你可以在屁股上涂很臭的东西
What you do is rub something that smells really bad on your butt, right?

97
00:06:00,006 --> 00:06:03,373
他拍了你之后，手就会很臭
Then, when he goes to smack you, his hand will smell.

98
00:06:06,212 --> 00:06:09,807
有什么很臭的东西 可以拿来涂？
Now, what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?

99
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:14,777
如果乔伊是总统该怎么办？
What if Joey was President?

100
00:06:18,224 --> 00:06:19,555
能不能问你一件事？
Can l ask you something?

101
00:06:20,326 --> 00:06:22,021
你可以反对
Okay, you can totally say no...

102
00:06:22,295 --> 00:06:26,322
我可以帮罗斯介绍女朋友吗？
...but would it be okay with you if l set Ross up on a date?

103
00:06:28,568 --> 00:06:29,398
谁？
With who?

104
00:06:29,703 --> 00:06:32,501
我的朋友邦妮 她一直觉得罗斯很可爱
My friend Bonnie. She always thought Ross was cute...

105
00:06:32,739 --> 00:06:35,367
问我能不能牵线
...and she asked if l could set it up.

106
00:06:35,575 --> 00:06:38,271
如果你会在意… 邦妮是哪一个？
-But if that's not cool.... -Which one is Bonnie?

107
00:06:38,545 --> 00:06:41,036
她来参加过我的庆生会
You remember her from my birthday party?

108
00:06:41,281 --> 00:06:43,408
不高不矮
Average height...

109
00:06:43,616 --> 00:06:45,811
不瘦不胖，理光头…
...medium build, bald....

110
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:51,088
没关系
That's fine.

111
00:06:51,725 --> 00:06:54,922
太棒了，很好
Great! Okay! Good for you! All right!

112
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,433
你是铁！你是钢！
You are iron! You are steel!

113
00:07:04,137 --> 00:07:07,698
我问你为何打去 你的电脑客服部
Let me ask you, how come when l call your computer support line...

114
00:07:07,907 --> 00:07:09,966
得等上一个半小时？
...l have to wait an hour and a half?

115
00:07:10,276 --> 00:07:13,734
我们有加派接线生 专心训练，好吗？
We're adding operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?

116
00:07:13,947 --> 00:07:17,383
一想到有邮件却收不到 我就心烦
lt's just hard when l know l have e-mail l can't get.

117
00:07:23,456 --> 00:07:24,354
亲爱的
Hi, honey.

118
00:07:24,557 --> 00:07:26,718
趴上去
On the table. On the table, please.

119
00:07:30,296 --> 00:07:33,527
我的朋友跟我谈到…
So listen, my friends were telling me a little bit about...

120
00:07:33,767 --> 00:07:35,462
终极格斗的事
...this Ultimate Fighting thing.

121
00:07:35,802 --> 00:07:37,770
听起来很危险
lt sounds really dangerous.

122
00:07:38,004 --> 00:07:41,064
我不希望你受伤 因为我蛮喜欢你的
l don't want you to get hurt because l kind of like you.

123
00:07:41,307 --> 00:07:44,743
我也不想受伤，我很精明
l don't want to get hurt either. l'm being smart about this.

124
00:07:44,978 --> 00:07:48,004
你看这些人 他们是世界顶尖的教练
See these guys? They're the best trainers in the world.

125
00:07:48,248 --> 00:07:51,081
星以前是职业杀手
And Hoshi here used to be a paid assassin.

126
00:07:51,818 --> 00:07:54,412
粉刷工人，他以前是粉刷工人
A house painter! He used to be a house painter!

127
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,788
答应我一定要小心 我答应你
-Promise me you'll be careful. -l promise.

128
00:07:59,993 --> 00:08:02,985
今晚照旧吗？ 那好，因为…
Are we still on for tonight? Good. Because...

129
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:05,959
我们也可以来运动一下
...maybe we could have a little workout of our own.

130
00:08:06,266 --> 00:08:07,927
大赛之前不准嘿咻
No boom-boom before big fight!

131
00:08:13,006 --> 00:08:14,303
能不能“嘿”就好？
How about just a boom?

132
00:08:19,012 --> 00:08:21,310
真令人沮丧 刚才卖硬面包给我的
That was depressing. l just bought a pretzel...

133
00:08:21,514 --> 00:08:23,607
是“名扬四海”的演员
...from one of the kids from Fame.

134
00:08:24,517 --> 00:08:27,509
可以去看电影了吗？ 这是邦妮
Ready to go to the movies? Oh, this is Bonnie!

135
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:30,949
这是邦妮？
This is Bonnie?

136
00:08:31,191 --> 00:08:33,159
这是邦妮？你是邦妮？
This is Bonnie? You're Bonnie?

137
00:08:33,359 --> 00:08:36,294
我可以拿身份证给你看
l can show you an l.D. if you want.

138
00:08:36,496 --> 00:08:40,523
不是，你跟上次见面差很多
Oh, no. You look a lot different than the last time l saw you.

139
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:43,701
是啊，我又开始戴胸罩了
Oh, yeah. Well, l just started wearing bras again.

140
00:08:44,504 --> 00:08:46,233
一定是这个原因
Oh, that must be it.

141
00:08:47,807 --> 00:08:49,035
祝你们玩得愉快
Have fun tonight.

142
00:08:49,242 --> 00:08:50,504
谢了，你们也是
Thanks. You too.

143
00:08:57,217 --> 00:08:58,479
你说她是光头
You said she was bald.

144
00:08:58,718 --> 00:09:00,515
以前是，现在不是
She was bald. She's not now.

145
00:09:02,555 --> 00:09:04,455
你怎么没说她有长头发？
How could you not tell me she has hair?

146
00:09:04,691 --> 00:09:07,558
我很少提到别人有长头发
l don't know. l hardly ever say that about people.

147
00:09:07,827 --> 00:09:09,658
真是帅呆了
Oh, well this is just perfect!

148
00:09:10,363 --> 00:09:13,355
对不起，你不是说没关系？
Well, l'm sorry. l thought you said it was okay.

149
00:09:13,566 --> 00:09:18,003
因为我以为她是个光头怪女人
l said it was okay when l thought she was some weird bald chick.

150
00:09:18,238 --> 00:09:20,832
她满头都是头发
That girl has got hair all over her head!

151
00:09:23,243 --> 00:09:27,407
也许罗斯不会喜欢她的个性 她的个性不好吗？
-Maybe Ross won't like her personality. -Does she have a bad personality?

152
00:09:27,614 --> 00:09:29,741
不，邦妮最随和了
Oh, no, Bonnie's the best!

153
00:09:35,421 --> 00:09:36,217
宾
Bing!

154
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:41,392
我看过你的企划案了 非常精彩
Read your CompuTek proposal. Real home run.

155
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:45,559
没有打中，站过来
Barely got you that time. Get over here!

156
00:09:46,532 --> 00:09:47,260
快点
Come on.

157
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:49,491
干得好
Oh, yeah! Good one.

158
00:09:49,802 --> 00:09:52,270
这次表现得很好，要保持
That was a good one. lKeep at it, team!

159
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,601
他是怎么搞的？ 怎么搞的？
-What is with him? -''With him''?

160
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,275
你是他的爱将
You're his favorite. You're his guy!

161
00:09:58,478 --> 00:09:59,911
我们没有被打过
We never get smacked.

162
00:10:01,547 --> 00:10:03,606
没这回事，他打过你一次
That's not true. He smacked you once.

163
00:10:03,816 --> 00:10:06,910
那是巧合 他打完你之后弹到我
Not on purpose. He ricocheted off you and got me.

164
00:10:07,253 --> 00:10:10,245
告诉你，我需要被打
l'm telling you, l need some smacks.

165
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,755
我有个小孩 要上达特茅斯海军学院
l got a kid starting Dartmouth.

166
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,792
达特茅斯？谁在上达特茅斯？ 那里逊毙了
Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth? Dartmouth sucks!

167
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:17,462
你上达特茅斯？ 不是
-You go to Dartmouth? -No, sir.

168
00:10:17,764 --> 00:10:19,254
那就好
There you go!

169
00:10:27,774 --> 00:10:29,332
那是什么？
God, Ross! What is that?

170
00:10:29,609 --> 00:10:31,236
终极格斗超值餐
The Ultimate Fighting Combo.

171
00:10:31,444 --> 00:10:34,572
省30毛，还可以收藏杯子
l saved 30 cents. Plus, l get to keep the cup.

174
00:10:43,823 --> 00:10:47,554
他在商场上以强硬著称
...he's known for his confrontational business style!

175
00:10:48,728 --> 00:10:52,164

彼特，我爱你

178
00:11:06,112 --> 00:11:10,105
他的对手来自加州亨丁顿滩

彼特
Pete?

183
00:11:32,205 --> 00:11:34,400
那家伙好魁梧 你放心
-That guy's pretty huge. -Don't worry.

184
00:11:34,674 --> 00:11:37,142
我会用他的力量反击他
l'll use his strength and weight against him.

185
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:41,642
那他的麻烦大了
Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.

186
00:11:46,753 --> 00:11:48,516
打倒他，加油
You go get him. Let's go!

187
00:11:49,856 --> 00:11:51,517
两位，来吧
Here we go, gentlemen.

188
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,053
准备好了吗？
Are you ready?

189
00:11:56,229 --> 00:11:58,789
准备好了吗？开战吧
Are you ready? Then let's get it on!

190
00:12:21,054 --> 00:12:22,248
是我
lt's me.

191
00:12:23,156 --> 00:12:24,851
摩妮卡
Monica.

192
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,254
我真的很以你为荣
Can l just tell you how proud l am of you?

193
00:12:30,463 --> 00:12:34,422
真窝心，刚才有两万人骂我逊
lt would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant, ''You suck!''

194
00:12:35,735 --> 00:12:37,703
我原本觉得你疯了
l thought you were nuts at first...

195
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,494
但是你做到了
...but you did it.

196
00:12:39,939 --> 00:12:42,908
现在你可以了无遗撼了
Now you can just look back at this with no regrets.

197
00:12:43,142 --> 00:12:44,609
了无遗撼？
Look back?

198
00:12:45,411 --> 00:12:47,276
你不是还要打吧？
You're not gonna keep going?

199
00:12:47,647 --> 00:12:51,310
我问你一件事 我是终极格斗冠军吗？
Let me ask you a question: Am l the Ultimate Fighting Champion?

200
00:12:53,453 --> 00:12:55,114
不是，但是…
Well, no. But--

201
00:12:55,421 --> 00:12:58,652
不当上冠军，我绝不罢休
l'm not gonna stop until l'm the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

202
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:03,559
那家伙踩着你的脖子 把你踩昏
That guy stood on your neck until you passed out.

203
00:13:04,363 --> 00:13:06,058
我告诉你一个故事
Let me tell you a story.

204
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:11,299
我着手研发的摩斯865 你以为是一夕成功？
When l set out to create MOSS 865, do you think it happened overnight?

205
00:13:11,571 --> 00:13:15,974
不是，摩斯一代 烧毁我爸的车库
No. There was MOSS 1 that burned down my dad's garage.

206
00:13:16,242 --> 00:13:20,144
摩斯二代只能排一月的行程表
There was MOSS 2 that would only schedule appointments in January.

207
00:13:20,346 --> 00:13:22,746
此外还有862次的失败经验
And 862 others that l learned from.

208
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:26,749
我从这场比赛就学到 绝不能让对手踩我的脖子
Just like l learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.

209
00:13:26,953 --> 00:13:29,148
你之前不知道？
You didn't know that already?

210
00:13:30,656 --> 00:13:32,647
我会越来越强
Look, l'm gonna get better.

211
00:13:33,493 --> 00:13:35,586
好吗？我保证
Okay? l promise you.

212
00:13:39,365 --> 00:13:41,663
要强很多
Just get a lot better.

213
00:13:42,135 --> 00:13:43,534
而且要快
Fast.

214
00:13:45,705 --> 00:13:46,729
还有一件事
One other thing.

215
00:13:47,006 --> 00:13:50,669
星认为你在场边 会影响我的注意力
Hoshi thinks you being ringside may have affected my concentration.

216
00:13:53,012 --> 00:13:54,775
对，关键就在这里
That was the problem.

217
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,187
彼特的比赛几点开始？ 还有五分钟
-How long until Pete's fight? -About five minutes.

218
00:14:04,457 --> 00:14:06,118
他们在访问他的对手
They're interviewing his opponent.

219
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:10,455
他的训练方式是 去伊朗拔断小偷的手臂
Apparently, he trains by going to lran and pulling the arms off thieves.

220
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:13,992
热狗？ 四根
-Hot dog? -Four, please.

221
00:14:14,634 --> 00:14:16,192
我很紧张
l'm really nervous.

222
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,194
谢谢
Thank you.

223
00:14:20,506 --> 00:14:23,634
你跟邦妮怎么样？
So how did it go with Bonnie?

224
00:14:23,876 --> 00:14:28,074
我一定要说 我没想到我会喜欢她
Oh, l gotta tell you, l wasn't expecting to like her at all.

225
00:14:28,347 --> 00:14:31,214
我目前根本没打算要喜欢别人
l actually wasn't expecting to like anyone right now.

226
00:14:31,484 --> 00:14:33,509
但她真的很棒
But she's really terrific.

227
00:14:33,786 --> 00:14:34,684
真糟糕
lt's too bad.

228
00:14:37,156 --> 00:14:39,556
我是说我喜欢她
No, l'm saying l liked her.

229
00:14:39,825 --> 00:14:41,725
你不必单恋一枝花
There are other fish in the sea.

230
00:14:42,995 --> 00:14:46,226
我觉得她很棒，我们要再见面
l think she's great, okay? We're going out again.

231
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:49,993
我听到了 你可以谈点别的吗？
l hear you. Are you capable of talking about anything else?

232
00:14:51,938 --> 00:14:53,906
我的土鸡汉堡在哪里？
Which one's my turkey burger?

233
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,435
在我脚边…抱歉
The one next to my foot. Sorry.

234
00:14:57,443 --> 00:14:59,673
比赛开始了 马上进去
-Fight's starting! -We'll be right in.

235
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:02,746
你的上司今天又打你了吗？
So did your boss try to slap you again today?

236
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:04,382
九次
Nine times.

237
00:15:05,218 --> 00:15:06,845
害我得擦润肤乳液
l had to put on lotion.

238
00:15:09,088 --> 00:15:11,921
不过没关系 我明天要做个实验
But it'll be okay. Tomorrow, l conduct an experiment.

239
00:15:12,191 --> 00:15:16,150
要是顺利，我的屁股就得救了
And if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack-free.

240
00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:18,023
比赛结束
Fight's over!

241
00:15:23,669 --> 00:15:25,068
道格？
Excuse me, Doug?

242
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,531
超级运动迷！
Hey there, sports fan!

243
00:15:29,909 --> 00:15:32,377
宾，数据做好了吗？
Bing! You got those numbers for me?

244
00:15:32,578 --> 00:15:34,512
没有，我没做
No. l didn't do them.

245
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,611
你忘了？
You forgot?

246
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:39,248
不是，我就是没做
No, l just didn't do them.

247
00:15:39,552 --> 00:15:43,249
我跟朋友出去，喝了两杯
lnstead, l hung out with some friends and had a couple of beers.

248
00:15:43,522 --> 00:15:46,184
所以我不值得表扬 不管是言语上…
So l certainly don't deserve praise. Verbal...

249
00:15:46,425 --> 00:15:48,017
或其他方式
...or otherwise.

250
00:15:48,661 --> 00:15:51,755
我昨晚也醉了 是某个美眉载我回家的
l got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home.

251
00:15:51,998 --> 00:15:54,466
塔本吉桥变得好小
Tappan Zee Bridge never looked smaller.

252
00:15:55,534 --> 00:15:58,662
没关系，你还是我的 头号爱将，宾！
That's okay. You're still my number-one guy! Bing!

253
00:15:59,305 --> 00:16:00,863
道格
Doug!

254
00:16:01,774 --> 00:16:06,268
我对你的表达方式有点不习惯
l'm a little bit uncomfortable with the way that you express yourself.

255
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:09,039
你是说我经常骂脏话？
ls it the swearing? ls it the constant swearing?

256
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:13,208
如果是的话 你可以亲我的屁股
Because l gotta tell you, if it is, you can just kiss my ass!

257
00:16:15,288 --> 00:16:18,018
不是骂脏话的事，而是…
lt's not about the swearing. lt's more about...

258
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:20,748
你偶尔会…
...the way that you occasionally...

259
00:16:21,027 --> 00:16:24,463
把注意力集中在…
...concentrate your enthusiasm...

260
00:16:25,765 --> 00:16:27,255
我的屁股上
...on my buttocks.

261
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:32,670
别误会，我了解你的用意
Don't get me wrong. l appreciate the sentiment.

262
00:16:32,905 --> 00:16:36,671
只不过我的臀部很敏感
lt's just that l have a rather sensitive posterior.

263
00:16:38,577 --> 00:16:41,876
而且别人都在嫉妒
And besides, it's making all the other guys jealous.

264
00:16:42,081 --> 00:16:46,017
别再说了，你确实很有勇气
Well, say no more. You know, it takes guts to bring this up.

265
00:16:46,285 --> 00:16:48,253
宾，很好
Bing, you're okay.

266
00:16:58,564 --> 00:17:02,091
你要住在满身大汗的 巨人的上衣口袋
Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant...

267
00:17:02,368 --> 00:17:04,836
还是他的排水管里？
...or inside his shower drain?

268
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:08,133
天哪
Oh, my God.

269
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,767
你看，是罗斯和那个女的
Look. lt's Ross and that girl.

270
00:17:14,113 --> 00:17:18,573
你看，有一排蚂蚁 他们在同心协力
Look at that! lt's a line of ants! They're working as a team!

271
00:17:20,586 --> 00:17:24,682
他们啊 罗斯好像要跟她分手了
Right. Oh, yeah. lt looks like Ross is breaking up with her.

272
00:17:24,957 --> 00:17:26,424
希望他不要太狠
l hope he lets her down easy.

273
00:17:26,659 --> 00:17:29,651
你看，他们没有要分手
Look at that! They are not breaking up! Look at them!

274
00:17:29,862 --> 00:17:32,922
那只是第二次的约会
You know what that is? A second date, that's what that is.

275
00:17:33,566 --> 00:17:35,830
你看，她把手放到他的大腿上
Look, she just put her hand on his thigh.

276
00:17:36,068 --> 00:17:38,662
小意思，她在性方面很主动
That's nothing. She's very sexually aggressive.

277
00:17:38,971 --> 00:17:39,960
天哪
Oh, God!

278
00:17:40,306 --> 00:17:45,039
都是你不好，他爱上她了 他会娶她，都是你的错
lt's your fault. Now he loves her. He'll marry her. lt's all your fault.

279
00:17:45,745 --> 00:17:47,235
你自己说没关系
You said it was okay.

280
00:17:47,546 --> 00:17:49,571
你说她是光头
You said she was bald!

281
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,381
以前！以前…
Was! Was, was, was!

282
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:58,680
我们得想个办法 我们得拆散他们
We can't let it happen. We have to do something. We have to break them up.

283
00:17:58,991 --> 00:18:03,189
进去帮她剃光头 你欠我一个光头女
Just go in there and shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!

284
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,793
你先深呼吸
Okay, first of all, breathe.

285
00:18:08,067 --> 00:18:10,501
再来，我实在不懂
Second of all, l don't get it.

286
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:13,830
不是你决定要跟罗斯分手的？
Aren't you the one that decided you didn't want to be with Ross?

287
00:18:17,343 --> 00:18:21,040
他不是你的朋友吗？ 你不希望他快乐吗？
Well, isn't he your friend? Don't you want him to be happy?

288
00:18:25,251 --> 00:18:26,377
所以？
So?

289
00:18:30,656 --> 00:18:35,150
但是我没想到会这么快
lt's just, you know, l didn't expect him to be this happy so soon.

290
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:45,937
完了 怎样？
-Oh, no. -What?

291
00:18:46,138 --> 00:18:47,196
它们被我们坐死了
We killed them all!

292
00:19:03,422 --> 00:19:06,289
没这么严重，这是以防万一
lt's not as bad as it looks. lt's a precaution.

293
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,050
我的脊椎骨不能动
l'm not supposed to move my spine.

294
00:19:11,597 --> 00:19:13,428
你要放弃了吧？
Please tell me you're stopping now.

295
00:19:13,899 --> 00:19:16,561
我没事，今晚要我上场都行
l'm fine. l'd fight tonight if they'd let me.

296
00:19:18,304 --> 00:19:20,898
你看这个圆
Now, see this circle l'm marking off here?

297
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,108
这是我的“恐怖区”
This is my Zone of Terror.

298
00:19:25,845 --> 00:19:29,246
你疯了，你一定要放弃
You are insane! You've got to give this up!

299
00:19:29,415 --> 00:19:32,350
除非我拿到格斗冠军
l can't until l'm the Ultimate Fighter.

300
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:33,745
我会成功的
l will do it.

301
00:19:33,953 --> 00:19:38,219
总有一天 小朋友会争辩我和超人…
The day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight...

302
00:19:38,457 --> 00:19:40,391
谁会打赢
...me or Superman.

303
00:19:42,228 --> 00:19:45,288
我赢不过超人 不过小孩子都很笨
Not that l could beat Superman, but kids are stupid.

304
00:19:46,532 --> 00:19:47,760
你先坐下
Just sit down.

305
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,865
听我说
Please listen to me.

306
00:19:50,102 --> 00:19:55,062
你打得很烂，你是史上 最烂的终极格斗手
You are terrible at this, okay? You are the worst Ultimate Fighter ever.

307
00:19:55,608 --> 00:19:56,540
最烂的
Ever!

308
00:19:57,977 --> 00:20:02,038
我的肌腱套破裂 右前臂有轻微骨折
l have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm...

309
00:20:02,281 --> 00:20:06,377
喉结严重瘀伤 但你的话最伤人
...and a severely bruised Adam's apple, but that really hurt.

310
00:20:11,991 --> 00:20:14,255
那么你知道吗？
Well, then, you know what?

311
00:20:16,328 --> 00:20:20,492
我没办法看你这样伤害自己
l care about you too much to watch you hurt yourself like this.

312
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,401
要是你非打不可 我就不奉陪了
So if you have to do this, you'll have to do it without me.

313
00:20:24,904 --> 00:20:26,838
如果你要我放弃
lf you're asking me to quit...

314
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:29,903
就是要我违背本性
...then you're asking me to be someone l'm not.

315
00:20:30,209 --> 00:20:31,676
我非打不可
l've got to do this.

316
00:20:36,015 --> 00:20:37,812
那我要走了
Then l've gotta go.

317
00:20:39,685 --> 00:20:40,652
再见
Bye.

318
00:20:48,961 --> 00:20:51,054
你可以留张字条吗？ 我服了止痛药
Could you leave a note? l'm on painkillers...

319
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,457
明天可能会忘记这件事
...and l might not remember this tomorrow.

320
00:20:58,938 --> 00:21:03,932
总而言之，曲线节节上升 我很满意
So, in conclusion, the lines all go up, so l'm happy.

321
00:21:04,843 --> 00:21:07,175
干得好，明天八点半见
Great job, team! Tomorrow at 8:30.

322
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,806
菲尔，干得好 史蒂芬，漂亮
Phil, nice job! Stevens, way to go!

323
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:13,280
戈博，你这个疯子
Goldberg, you maniac!

324
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:15,043
我爱你
l love you!

325
00:21:18,357 --> 00:21:21,155
宾，没有你可不行 谢谢
-Couldn't have done it without you. -Thank you, sir.

326
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,657
抱歉
Oh, excuse me.

327
00:21:22,861 --> 00:21:26,592
我忘了拿公事包，不小心的
l forgot my briefcase, you know, by accident.

328
00:21:26,899 --> 00:21:30,391
当然是不小心的 你还忘了一件事
Of course, you did. Forgot something else too, you bastard!

329
00:21:33,105 --> 00:21:35,164
你呢？
Well, what about you?

330
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:37,932
不会觉得被冷落了吧？
You're not feeling left out, are you?

331
00:21:39,244 --> 00:21:41,906
一点也不会，开什么玩笑
No, not at all. That's ridiculous.

332
00:21:42,114 --> 00:21:45,311
大家都有 你也想来一下，对吧？
Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Don't you?

333
00:21:48,621 --> 00:21:49,918
没错
Yes, l do.

334
00:21:50,222 --> 00:21:52,349
给我滚吧
Now, get on out of here, you!

335
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,359
彼特贝克绕着格斗场
Pete Becker circles the ring.

336
00:21:59,632 --> 00:22:02,100
似乎想弄清楚自己的情势
Looks like he's just trying to feel him out.

337
00:22:02,301 --> 00:22:03,791
“重伤害”进攻了
Bruiser is charging!

338
00:22:04,103 --> 00:22:06,697
快逃啊，死有钱人
Run, you crazy, rich freak!

339
00:22:08,407 --> 00:22:09,669
我不敢看
l can't watch this.

340
00:22:09,942 --> 00:22:11,569
你看，彼特要赢了
Check it out! Pete's winning!

341
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:12,936
真的？
Really?

342
00:22:16,348 --> 00:22:20,751
“重伤害”把贝克打倒在地 向他最喜欢的部位进攻
Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favorite area!

343
00:22:22,588 --> 00:22:26,456
既然是最喜欢的部位 为何要下这种毒手？
Wait! lf that's his favorite area, why is he being so mean to it?

344
00:22:27,126 --> 00:22:28,388
真是讽刺
This is ironic.

345
00:22:28,627 --> 00:22:31,289
你的前任男友李察不想生小孩
Your last boyfriend, Richard, didn't want to have kids.

346
00:22:31,563 --> 00:22:34,225
现在看情况，彼特是不能生
And from the looks of it, now Pete can't.
