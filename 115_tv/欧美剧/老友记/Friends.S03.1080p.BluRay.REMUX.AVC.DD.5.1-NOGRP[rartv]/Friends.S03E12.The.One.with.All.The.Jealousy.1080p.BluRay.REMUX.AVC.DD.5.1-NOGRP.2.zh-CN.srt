1
00:00:04,216 --> 00:00:07,150
- Does everybody hate these shoes?
- Yeah.

2
00:00:07,585 --> 00:00:11,519
But don't worry. Nobody's gonna focus
on that if you wear that towel-dress.

3
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:14,377
Tell him.

4
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:18,853
It's her first day at this new job.
You're not supposed to start with her.

5
00:00:19,824 --> 00:00:22,348
All right, I suppose I can wait a day.

6
00:00:23,527 --> 00:00:25,289
- What are you doing Friday?
- Why?

7
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:28,291
I need you at a bachelor party
for my weird cousin, Albert.

8
00:00:28,463 --> 00:00:30,225
You know, he's the botanist?

9
00:00:30,398 --> 00:00:31,694
Oh, God!

10
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:33,922
Botanists are such geeks.

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,997
Is that a dinosaur tie?

12
00:00:42,938 --> 00:00:44,030
Morning!

13
00:00:44,406 --> 00:00:46,839
Rach, I'm here with the purses!

14
00:00:48,508 --> 00:00:51,169
It must take you forever
to find your keys.

15
00:00:51,576 --> 00:00:52,940
Thank you, Pheebs.

16
00:00:53,177 --> 00:00:56,111
You're welcome. Please want
the one with the turtles.

17
00:00:56,279 --> 00:00:58,905
No, turtles scare me.
I don't need that today.

18
00:01:00,248 --> 00:01:02,807
Honey, just relax.
It's gonna be fine.

19
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:05,676
Why don't I come down there,
and I'll take you to lunch?

20
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,511
Honey, thank you!
But Mark's taking me out.

21
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:12,682
Mark? Is that the same Mark
that helped you get the job?

22
00:01:12,854 --> 00:01:16,289
Yeah, it's kind of like a "good luck
on your first day" sort of thing.

23
00:01:16,457 --> 00:01:17,684
Is this a lunch box?

24
00:01:18,658 --> 00:01:21,148
No, it's a purse.
And there's a thermos in it.

25
00:01:23,795 --> 00:01:26,194
- So can you make it on Friday?
- What?

26
00:01:26,363 --> 00:01:28,990
Yeah, I think so.
Why am I invited to this again?

27
00:01:29,164 --> 00:01:30,791
Apparently, Albert has no friends.

28
00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:32,966
He's very excited about
the bachelor party.

29
00:01:33,167 --> 00:01:36,498
I think, actually, he's only getting
married so he can see a stripper.

30
00:01:38,236 --> 00:01:41,692
A stripper at a bachelor party.
That is so cliche.

31
00:01:41,972 --> 00:01:44,633
Why don't you guys get a magician?

32
00:01:45,341 --> 00:01:49,139
Well, if a magician can open my beer
with his butt cheeks, then all right.

33
00:01:51,944 --> 00:01:52,967
The One With All the Jealousy

34
00:02:38,571 --> 00:02:41,697
She's having lunch with him?
Lunch with him?

35
00:02:41,872 --> 00:02:44,669
You should've seen the hug he gave her
when she got the job!

36
00:02:44,907 --> 00:02:47,773
And he's really good-looking.

37
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,443
- What am I gonna do?
- You don't do anything.

38
00:02:51,745 --> 00:02:54,269
Keep it inside.
Learn how to hide your feelings.

39
00:02:56,147 --> 00:02:57,205
Don't cry out loud.

40
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,481
Guess who has an audition
for a Broadway musical?

41
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:07,176
I wanna say you, but it seems like
such an easy answer.

42
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:11,586
It is me! It's a musical version
of A Tale of Two Cities.

43
00:03:11,822 --> 00:03:15,313
So I think I'm gonna sing
"New York, New York"...

44
00:03:15,558 --> 00:03:18,253
...and "I Left My Heart
in San Francisco."

45
00:03:20,927 --> 00:03:24,657
Joey, I don't think
you get to pick the cities.

46
00:03:25,397 --> 00:03:28,524
- What?
- Mr. Dickens gets to pick them.

47
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:32,597
Who?

48
00:03:32,768 --> 00:03:34,668
I'll get you the Cliff Notes.

49
00:03:35,002 --> 00:03:38,368
- The what?
- The abridgment.

50
00:03:38,872 --> 00:03:41,601
Okay.

51
00:03:42,206 --> 00:03:43,935
The what?

52
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,667
Then the style number...

53
00:03:50,245 --> 00:03:54,339
...the invoice number
and the shipping date.

54
00:03:54,514 --> 00:03:56,538
Good. Any questions so far?

55
00:03:57,082 --> 00:03:58,742
What kind of discount do we get?

56
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:03,745
- Twenty percent.
- I love this job!

57
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:07,382
- My first call!
- Here, let me.

58
00:04:08,321 --> 00:04:10,185
Rachel Greene's line.
How may I help you?

59
00:04:10,356 --> 00:04:11,618
Hi, is Rachel there?

60
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:14,781
- And who may I say is calling?
- This is Ross.

61
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,016
Ross of?

62
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:19,452
Of Ross and Rachel.

63
00:04:19,628 --> 00:04:21,788
Hi, it's Mark.

64
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:23,895
- Hey, Mark.
- Hey.

65
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,893
Hold on a second.
It's Ross.

66
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:29,329
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

67
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,099
What's Mark doing
answering your phone?

68
00:04:32,369 --> 00:04:34,097
Oh, he's just goofing around.

69
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,361
Oh, that's funny.

70
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:41,464
Why isn't he goofing around
in his own office?

71
00:04:41,641 --> 00:04:45,735
This is his office too. I told you,
we're Joanna's two assistants.

72
00:04:46,343 --> 00:04:48,173
Why does Joanna need two assistants?

73
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:50,468
How lazy is she?

74
00:04:51,612 --> 00:04:53,772
Oh, my God! What did I just do?

75
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,174
I think I just shipped 3000 bras
to Personnel!

76
00:04:56,415 --> 00:04:58,110
Honey, I gotta go!
Mark, I need you!

77
00:04:58,284 --> 00:05:00,615
Okay! Bye-bye!

78
00:05:02,453 --> 00:05:03,646
Ross!

79
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,344
I'm sorry, sweetie.
I was just trying to...

80
00:05:06,621 --> 00:05:08,520
I was dialing another number.

81
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,760
All right, I just got changed in 30
seconds so you could be alone with him.

82
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:27,194
You better go for it.

83
00:05:27,366 --> 00:05:29,458
Please. I'm not going for anything.

84
00:05:29,634 --> 00:05:31,100
Well, if you don't, I will.

85
00:05:31,335 --> 00:05:32,996
Would you please go?

86
00:05:33,603 --> 00:05:35,537
'Night, Mon.

87
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:38,863
'Night, Julio.

88
00:05:49,645 --> 00:05:51,374
Julio, someone left their book here.

89
00:05:52,347 --> 00:05:55,110
Actually, that is mine.

90
00:05:55,783 --> 00:05:57,113
What are you reading?

91
00:05:57,383 --> 00:06:01,784
Flowers of Evil, by Baudelaire.
Have you read it?

92
00:06:01,953 --> 00:06:03,511
Have I read it?

93
00:06:05,021 --> 00:06:07,045
No. Are you enjoying it?

94
00:06:08,556 --> 00:06:11,353
I thought that I would,
but the translation's no good.

95
00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:14,455
You're a poet,
and you don't know it.

96
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:20,023
Actually, I...

97
00:06:20,363 --> 00:06:21,591
I am a poet.

98
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,224
So you do know it.

99
00:06:30,636 --> 00:06:34,661
So, what kind of things
do you write about?

100
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:36,868
Things that move me:

101
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,307
The shadow of a tree...

102
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:41,602
...a child laughing...

103
00:06:43,643 --> 00:06:44,735
...or this lip.

104
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,399
Mine?

105
00:06:47,412 --> 00:06:48,537
Right here?

106
00:06:50,313 --> 00:06:54,646
I could write an epic poem
about this lip.

107
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,513
How would that go?

108
00:07:12,827 --> 00:07:15,488
Well, it didn't rhyme...

109
00:07:15,694 --> 00:07:16,718
...but I liked it.

110
00:07:36,007 --> 00:07:37,371
Lovely.

111
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:38,803
Just lovely.

112
00:07:39,175 --> 00:07:40,574
Really? Thanks.

113
00:07:40,743 --> 00:07:44,268
Listen, Joey. We definitely want
to see you for the callback on Saturday.

114
00:07:44,678 --> 00:07:45,736
Excellent!

115
00:07:46,512 --> 00:07:47,570
- I'll be there.
- Okay.

116
00:07:47,847 --> 00:07:51,281
And listen, don't forget to bring
your jazz shoes for the dance audition.

117
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,785
My agent said that
it wasn't a dancing part.

118
00:07:58,953 --> 00:08:01,750
Joey, all the roles gotta dance a little.

119
00:08:02,022 --> 00:08:05,148
Believe me, with your dance background,
it'll be a piece of cake.

120
00:08:05,323 --> 00:08:08,621
"Three years of modern dance
with Twyla Tharp"?

121
00:08:09,725 --> 00:08:12,557
"Five years with
the American Ballet Theatre"?

122
00:08:14,762 --> 00:08:18,060
Hey, everybody lies
on their resume, okay?

123
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:20,697
I wasn't one of
the Zoom kids either.

124
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:23,962
Well, can you, like, dance at all?

125
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:26,293
Yeah, I can dance.
You know...

126
00:08:35,173 --> 00:08:37,640
Oh, no, no, no, no.

127
00:08:39,109 --> 00:08:40,336
What is that?

128
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:44,437
Sure, it looks stupid now.
There's no music playing.

129
00:08:45,146 --> 00:08:47,375
I have to get that.
But, no, no.

130
00:08:49,215 --> 00:08:52,513
Hello. Hi.

131
00:08:53,117 --> 00:08:58,552
Yeah, listen, I'm in need of a stripper,
and I was told that you do that.

132
00:09:01,822 --> 00:09:05,415
Let me ask you this. What do you do
for the extra hundred?

133
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:10,115
So would I have to provide the grapes?

134
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,749
Hi.

135
00:09:12,394 --> 00:09:14,486
How was last night
with Julio, senorita?

136
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:19,288
It so was amazing. He's so sexy and
smart, which makes him even sexier.

137
00:09:19,465 --> 00:09:22,228
I gotta tell you this. Last night,
we were fooling around...

138
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,391
...and all of a sudden he stops
to write a poem.

139
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:29,170
Get out! I couldn't stop
if a meteor hit me.

140
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:36,235
Okay, we have our stripper,
a Miss Crystal Chandelier.

141
00:09:36,408 --> 00:09:39,842
Sure, you name a kid that, what do you
expect them to grow up to be?

142
00:09:42,245 --> 00:09:44,940
Anyway, when he left, he forgot
to take the poem with him.

143
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:49,706
Now, I am totally dense about poetry,
but I think this is pretty good.

144
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:52,850
Check it out. Read it.

145
00:09:53,318 --> 00:09:56,410
"The Empty Vase."
Translucent beauty...

146
00:09:56,586 --> 00:09:57,814
To yourself.

147
00:10:02,056 --> 00:10:03,647
You know what? That's pretty good.

148
00:10:03,824 --> 00:10:05,189
Good. I think so too.
Phoebe?

149
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:06,484
Yeah.

150
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:08,489
Great! I'm so glad you guys like it!

151
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,423
- All right, I gotta go to work.
- Hold on. I'm not done.

152
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:14,019
All right, give it back when
you're through.

153
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,762
- See you guys.
- Bye-bye.

154
00:10:17,331 --> 00:10:19,662
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Poor Monica!

155
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,266
What? What? What?

156
00:10:21,434 --> 00:10:24,333
What? He was with her
when he wrote this poem!

157
00:10:24,502 --> 00:10:27,868
Look! My vessel so lovely,
with nothing inside?

158
00:10:28,038 --> 00:10:30,801
Now that I've touched you,
you seem emptier still?

159
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,098
He thinks Monica's empty.
She's the empty vase!

160
00:10:34,275 --> 00:10:36,504
- Vase, vase?
- Monica's not an empty vase.

161
00:10:36,676 --> 00:10:38,666
You think vase?

162
00:10:39,244 --> 00:10:42,007
- You really think that's what he meant?
- Totally.

163
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:44,772
Oh, God!
And she seems so happy too.

164
00:10:45,414 --> 00:10:46,972
Done.

165
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:49,571
What happened?

166
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,944
Joey, what do you think
this poem means?

167
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,979
Monica's the vase, right?

168
00:10:55,787 --> 00:10:57,219
You are such a mystery to me.

169
00:11:08,861 --> 00:11:11,226
Do you have the Ralph Lauren file?

170
00:11:11,396 --> 00:11:15,126
Oh, yeah, sure! It's right...

171
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:20,461
What's that?

172
00:11:20,634 --> 00:11:22,897
It's from Ross. It's a Love Bug.

173
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:27,895
Somebody wants people to know
you have a boyfriend.

174
00:11:28,072 --> 00:11:31,040
No, that's not what he's doing.

175
00:11:31,207 --> 00:11:32,537
He's just really romantic.

176
00:11:33,808 --> 00:11:36,640
- Excuse me. Are you Rachel Greene?
- Yes.

177
00:11:39,011 --> 00:11:40,000
One, two, three.

178
00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:43,146
Congratulations on your first week
At your brand-new job

179
00:11:43,814 --> 00:11:45,940
It won't be long
Before you're the boss

180
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,975
And you know who will be there
To support you

181
00:11:50,217 --> 00:11:51,548
Your one and only boyfriend

182
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:53,308
It's nice to have a boyfriend!

183
00:11:53,553 --> 00:11:57,453
Your loyal, loving boyfriend, Ross!

184
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,621
I'm hurt!
I'm actually hurt...

185
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:12,821
...that you'd think I'd send you any of
those things out of anything but love.

186
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:15,192
Hurt! Hurt!

187
00:12:15,366 --> 00:12:17,992
All right, Ross. I get it. You're hurt!

188
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:20,361
Can't a guy send
a barbershop quartet...

189
00:12:20,601 --> 00:12:23,569
...to his girlfriend's office anymore?

190
00:12:25,004 --> 00:12:27,665
Oh, please!
Ross, it was so obvious.

191
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,271
It was like you were
marking your territory.

192
00:12:30,507 --> 00:12:34,669
You might as well have just come in
and peed all around my desk!

193
00:12:36,211 --> 00:12:38,269
I would never do that.

194
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,738
Look, I know what's going
on here, okay?

195
00:12:42,948 --> 00:12:47,280
Mark explained it all to me.
He said this is what you guys do.

196
00:12:47,451 --> 00:12:51,283
Yeah, well, if Mark said that,
then Mark's an idiot.

197
00:12:51,453 --> 00:12:52,784
Mark's a genius.

198
00:12:52,953 --> 00:12:55,012
Why? How?
How is he a genius?

199
00:12:55,288 --> 00:12:56,949
Don't you see what's happening here?

200
00:12:57,123 --> 00:13:00,284
Instead of hitting on her right away,
he's becoming her confidante.

201
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:04,756
Now he's gonna be the guy she goes to,
to complain about you.

202
00:13:07,195 --> 00:13:08,184
You okay over there?

203
00:13:08,463 --> 00:13:11,919
I tried taking a dance class today
to get ready for this callback tomorrow.

204
00:13:12,098 --> 00:13:14,964
- How'd it go?
- Knocked over a girl.

205
00:13:15,934 --> 00:13:19,163
Good work. Can we get back to the
Mark thing? What am I gonna do?

206
00:13:19,335 --> 00:13:21,268
Why don't you send her a musical bug?

207
00:13:21,436 --> 00:13:22,733
No, you already did that.

208
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,466
All right, you're gonna have
to go there yourself now.

209
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:31,538
- Make a few surprise visits.
- I don't know, you guys.

210
00:13:31,776 --> 00:13:34,039
Fine, don't do anything.
Just sit and talk to us.

211
00:13:34,277 --> 00:13:36,904
Meanwhile, she is talking
to him about you.

212
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:38,705
And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive.

213
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,974
She starts thinking, "Maybe this is the
guy for me because he understands me."

214
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:45,241
And before you know it,
she's with him.

215
00:13:45,417 --> 00:13:48,579
And you'll be all, "Oh, man!"

216
00:13:48,752 --> 00:13:50,515
And he'll be all, "Yes!"

217
00:13:52,221 --> 00:13:55,348
And us, we'll be like, "Oh, dude!"

218
00:13:57,357 --> 00:13:59,881
And pretty soon you'll be like:

219
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:02,651
"Hi."

220
00:14:02,826 --> 00:14:07,420
And, "Well, I can't go.
Rachel and Mark might be there."

221
00:14:08,397 --> 00:14:11,194
And we'll be like, "Man, get over it!
It's been four years!"

222
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:16,960
He paints quite a picture, doesn't he?

223
00:14:20,003 --> 00:14:22,334
Here's the Shelley Segal stuff
for December.

224
00:14:22,505 --> 00:14:24,938
Wait, I've got something for you.

225
00:14:25,106 --> 00:14:27,505
- Mark.
- It's okay. Rachel knows.

226
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,640
Yeah, but even so.

227
00:14:30,076 --> 00:14:33,168
I can't help it.
I'm just crazy about you.

228
00:14:33,444 --> 00:14:36,412
Oh, that is so sweet!

229
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,339
I know I'm Mr. Inappropriate today,
but it's just so tough.

230
00:14:41,516 --> 00:14:44,813
I mean, I see you walking around,
and I want to touch you and hold you.

231
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,784
Come on, no one's around.
Just kiss me.

232
00:14:47,952 --> 00:14:50,181
All right, that's it!
Get off of her!

233
00:14:50,354 --> 00:14:51,547
What is going on?

234
00:14:51,721 --> 00:14:54,553
What's going on?
I'll tell you what's going on!

235
00:14:54,723 --> 00:14:56,656
Ross!

236
00:15:01,093 --> 00:15:05,687
I have been down in your store
for 20 minutes, trying to get a tie.

237
00:15:07,763 --> 00:15:10,287
What do I have to do
to get some service?

238
00:15:12,433 --> 00:15:14,333
Hi, Rach.

239
00:15:22,372 --> 00:15:26,068
Joey? Joey Tribbiani?

240
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,340
Joey, I've got a problem.

241
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,668
I just got a call
from my dance captain.

242
00:15:33,945 --> 00:15:37,004
He's having a relationship crisis
and can't get out of Long Island.

243
00:15:37,181 --> 00:15:39,307
So does that mean the audition's off?

244
00:15:39,515 --> 00:15:42,880
Listen, Joey. Seeing as you've got
the most experience...

245
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:46,109
...I want you to take these dancers
and teach them the combination.

246
00:15:48,387 --> 00:15:49,411
What?

247
00:15:49,587 --> 00:15:53,488
Joey, come on. It's easy.
You know, it's hand, hand...

248
00:15:53,657 --> 00:15:55,419
...head, head...

249
00:15:55,591 --> 00:16:00,151
...up, pas de bourree, pas de bourree,
big turn here, rond de jambe.

250
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:02,451
Slide, step, step...

251
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,289
...and jazz hands!

252
00:16:07,398 --> 00:16:10,957
It's steppity-step and jazz hands.

253
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,562
Have fun.

254
00:16:13,367 --> 00:16:15,231
Bye.

255
00:16:18,337 --> 00:16:19,668
- Hey.
- Hey.

256
00:16:19,838 --> 00:16:21,237
What are you wrapping?

257
00:16:21,673 --> 00:16:23,867
Look what I got Julio.

258
00:16:27,108 --> 00:16:28,302
Yeah, it's a vase.

259
00:16:28,477 --> 00:16:31,411
Yeah, just like the one in the poem.

260
00:16:31,611 --> 00:16:34,101
Not exactly like
the one in the poem.

261
00:16:35,247 --> 00:16:36,235
What do you mean?

262
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:39,681
Remember how you said you were
really dense about poetry?

263
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,346
So I'm just an empty vase?

264
00:16:48,554 --> 00:16:50,111
What?

265
00:16:50,288 --> 00:16:52,778
So, I don't read as many
important books as you do.

266
00:16:52,957 --> 00:16:57,415
And I don't write trick poems
that aren't actually what they seem.

267
00:16:57,593 --> 00:17:00,117
And you know what?
I get excited about stupid stuff...

268
00:17:00,294 --> 00:17:02,693
...like when my People magazine
comes on Saturday...

269
00:17:02,863 --> 00:17:05,592
...and the new
Hold Everything catalog.

270
00:17:05,798 --> 00:17:10,062
But that doesn't mean I'm empty. I care
about things, like friends and family.

271
00:17:10,234 --> 00:17:14,191
You have no right to make that kind of
judgment! You don't even know me!

272
00:17:14,803 --> 00:17:16,895
The poem is not about you.

273
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:22,066
- What?
- "The Empty Vase" is not about you.

274
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:26,766
My baby preciosa, you make me so sad
that you would think this.

275
00:17:29,744 --> 00:17:32,234
I'm sorry. It's...
My friend Phoebe said...

276
00:17:32,412 --> 00:17:35,869
No, it's...
It's about all women.

277
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:40,814
Well, all American women.

278
00:17:42,785 --> 00:17:44,046
You feel better now?

279
00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:51,278
All right, let's do it.

280
00:18:11,968 --> 00:18:13,162
What was that?

281
00:18:14,003 --> 00:18:16,470
I know. It's the best
I could get out of them.

282
00:18:18,172 --> 00:18:19,638
Well, people!

283
00:18:19,907 --> 00:18:21,999
People, people, people!

284
00:18:22,508 --> 00:18:27,375
Let's try it again. And this time,
let's everybody watch Joey.

285
00:18:28,912 --> 00:18:30,435
Show them how it's done.

286
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,439
Count it off, Mack.

287
00:18:50,257 --> 00:18:52,952
Did you have fun at
the bachelor party last night?

288
00:18:53,126 --> 00:18:56,150
Yeah, look what I got!
See, she's fully dressed, right?

289
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:59,827
And then you click it,
and she's naked!

290
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:04,291
And then you click it again,
and she's dressed.

291
00:19:04,465 --> 00:19:06,830
She's a business woman,
walking down the street.

292
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,626
She's window shopping,
and she's naked!

293
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,331
Hi.

294
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,735
Hello.

295
00:19:21,675 --> 00:19:24,507
You know what? I'm gonna spend
some alone time with the pen.

296
00:19:33,648 --> 00:19:36,309
I'm sorry. I was an idiot.

297
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,214
A big idiot.

298
00:19:38,451 --> 00:19:39,849
A big idiot.

299
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:45,611
It's just you have to realize this whole
Mark thing is really hard for me.

300
00:19:46,156 --> 00:19:49,555
Honey, why is it hard? We've
been together for almost a year now.

301
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:53,025
Well, I was with Carol
for, like, eight years.

302
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:55,683
And I lost her.

303
00:19:56,861 --> 00:19:59,829
And now, if it's possible,
I think I love you even more.

304
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:03,630
So it's hard for me
to believe I'm not gonna...

305
00:20:03,832 --> 00:20:07,631
...well, that someone else isn't
gonna take you away.

306
00:20:07,801 --> 00:20:10,496
Let it be me. Let it be me!

307
00:20:15,806 --> 00:20:18,797
Honey, that's very sweet.

308
00:20:19,008 --> 00:20:22,840
It just seems to me, though,
that if two people love each other...

309
00:20:23,043 --> 00:20:25,510
...and trust each other, like we do...

310
00:20:25,712 --> 00:20:27,838
...there's no reason to be jealous.

311
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,217
I gotta get going.
Bye, Chandler.

312
00:20:38,752 --> 00:20:43,517
Okay, Ross, this pen's getting kind of
boring. Can you pick me up some porn?

313
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:47,478
Where you going?

314
00:20:47,657 --> 00:20:50,454
I've gotta go pick up Ben.
We got a play-date this afternoon.

315
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:52,250
With who?

316
00:20:52,493 --> 00:20:55,052
Just this woman I met
last night at the party.

317
00:20:55,261 --> 00:20:56,989
There was a woman at...?

318
00:20:59,397 --> 00:21:00,489
The stripper?

319
00:21:01,698 --> 00:21:05,690
- Yeah.
- You have a play-date with a stripper?

320
00:21:07,002 --> 00:21:08,866
Man, I gotta get a kid!

321
00:21:15,706 --> 00:21:19,698
Yeah, we started talking
after she did her thing...

322
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:22,274
...and it turns out she's got a boy
about Ben's age.

323
00:21:22,443 --> 00:21:25,536
So we're gonna take the kids
to a Gymboree class.

324
00:21:26,213 --> 00:21:28,271
- Is that okay?
- Sure. Is she married?

325
00:21:28,514 --> 00:21:30,310
No.

326
00:21:35,718 --> 00:21:36,706
Are you jealous?

327
00:21:38,053 --> 00:21:41,919
No, I just don't see why she has
to play with you. That's all.

328
00:21:42,088 --> 00:21:47,683
I mean, doesn't she, you know, have any
other stripper-mom friends of her own?

329
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,753
You are totally jealous!

330
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:56,424
I'm not jealous, all right.
This is about...

331
00:21:58,297 --> 00:22:01,424
...people feeling certain things...

332
00:22:01,699 --> 00:22:03,257
...you know, about...

333
00:22:03,967 --> 00:22:07,231
...strippers. And, you know...

334
00:22:07,469 --> 00:22:08,628
I love you too.

335
00:22:09,137 --> 00:22:10,126
Bye.

336
00:22:10,571 --> 00:22:11,969
Wait, wait, wait!

337
00:22:12,139 --> 00:22:13,833
What?

338
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,912
Well, there's a kiss he won't forget
for a few hours.

339
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:34,949
Either that or you just turned him on
and sent him to a stripper.

340
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:41,320
All right, I'm jealous.
I'm jealous!

341
00:22:41,488 --> 00:22:46,185
"Oh, no. Chandler, please don't.
No, I beg of you to not..."

342
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,816
Is there a Julio here?

343
00:22:53,662 --> 00:22:55,595
I am Julio.

344
00:22:56,297 --> 00:22:57,786
Mr. Pretentious

345
00:22:58,498 --> 00:23:01,398
You think there's no one finer
Your poems are unpublished

346
00:23:01,801 --> 00:23:03,563
And you work in a diner

347
00:23:03,802 --> 00:23:08,203
You're no God's gift to women
That's all in your head

348
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:11,465
- You are just a butt-munch
- No one likes a butt-munch!

349
00:23:11,639 --> 00:23:15,870
And you're also bad in bed

350
00:23:19,544 --> 00:23:20,533
