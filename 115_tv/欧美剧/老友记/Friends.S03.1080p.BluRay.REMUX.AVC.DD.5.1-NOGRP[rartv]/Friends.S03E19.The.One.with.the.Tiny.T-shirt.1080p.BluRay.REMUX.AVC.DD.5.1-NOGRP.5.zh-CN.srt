00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,060
瑞秋
"Say,Rachel...

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,360
有空要不要一起去看电影…
...I was wondering if you'd go to a movie with me sometime...

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,100
以情侣的身份
...as my lover."

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,670
太明显了
Too out there.

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,710
改天要不要一起吃饭…
"Maybe you'd like to have dinner with me sometime...

7
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,080
以情侣的身份
...as my lover."

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,650
好，买东西去
All right,let's go shopping.

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,260
我的信用卡收入大于支出，我想在花旗银行破产之前使用它
l got a positive balance on my credit card l want to use before Citibank goes under.

10
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,890
好主意，好主意
Good idea. Good idea.

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,990
走之前我有话要说
Before we go,there's something I need to say.

12
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,200
我很喜欢你
I've kind of had this crush on you.

13
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,210
以前有罗斯，我不方便行动
Since you were with Ross,I didn't do anything about it.

14
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:54,370
既然你们分手，我想约你出去
Now that you're not,I'd really like to ask you out sometime.

15
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,040
我现在就是在…
So that's what I'm doing...

16
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,410
约你
... now.

17
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,930
我掉了一个杯子
I dropped a cup.

18
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:20,000
本集播出：“小T恤”
The One With the Tiny T-Shirt

19
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,980
再过几年，语音辨识系统
So within a few years,voice recognition...

20
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,310
将成为电脑基本配备
...will be standard on any computer.

21
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,460
你可以说“去洗车” “去打扫房间”
You know,so you could be,like,"Wash my car." "Clean my room."

22
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,470
电脑办不到，但是听得懂
It won't be able to do any of those things,but it'll understand.

23
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,200
哇哦，如果我这样讲话的话 它能辨别出我的声音吗
Wow. Would it be able to recognize my voice if l talked like this?

24
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:28,030
是的，会懂你的意思，但是也会取笑你
Oh, yeah. lt'll understand you,but it's gonna make fun of you.

25
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,440
好棒喔
Oh,this was so great.

26
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,980
是啊
Yeah,it was.

27
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,880
就这样吧
All right,then.

28
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,810
再见
Bye.

29
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,250
嗨，不住在这里的人
Hello,people who do not live here.

30
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,760
备用钥匙是有急事时用的
I gave you a key for emergencies.

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,130
我们没有多力多滋了（薯片品牌）
We were out of Doritos.

32
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,400
跟百万富翁的约会如何？
Hey,how'd the date go with Mr. Millionaire?

33

35
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,310
他很棒，我们在一起很开心
He's great. We have such a good time together.

36
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,610
他风趣又体帖 而我对他没兴趣
He's so funny and so sweet. And I'm not attracted to him at all!

37
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,120
还是没兴趣？
Still?

38
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,650
我快疯了 他在各方面都很完美
It's driving me crazy. In every other way,he's the perfect guy.

39
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,860
他什么都好，而且什么都有
He has everything. Plus,he actually has everything.

40

00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,100
乔伊和我可以拿来对打吗？
Can Joey and I put them on and fight?

43
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,780
老妈，老爸，我是超级坏小子
Oh,Mommy! Oh,Daddy! I am a big old baddy

44
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:45,210
老妈，老爸，我是超级坏小子
Oh,Mommy! Oh,Daddy! I am a big old baddy

45
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:52,460
他一定得到那出舞台剧了
I guess he must've gotten the part in that play.

46
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,630
或正如葛萝莉亚伊丝特芬（拉丁歌后）所唱
Either that,or Gloria Estefan was right.

47
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,330
人迟早会随节奏起舞（歌名）
Eventually,the rhythm is going to get you.

48
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,300
乔，你好吗？ 很好

你演艾德莉恩？
So you're playing Adrianne?

50
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,310
对，你演智障堂哥？
Yes. Are you one of the retarded cousins?

51
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:23,080
不是，我演你的丈夫维克多 乔伊崔比亚尼
No. I'm playing your husband,Victor. I'm Joey Tribbiani.

52
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,720
很高兴认识你，凯特米勒
Hi. Nice to meet you. Kate Miller.

53
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:35,070
这个剧本很棒吧？
So the play's pretty great,huh?

54
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,770
是啊，我好喜欢 珍妮佛班贝利的作品
Oh,yeah. I love Jennifer Banberry's work.

She's so incisive when it comes to deconstructing the middle class.

00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,610
不用多说，她超厉害
Oh,forget about it. She rocks!

57
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,380
我在哪里见过你？

61
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,590
不是那个
No,that's not it.

62
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,400
原来你是连续剧演员
So you're a soap actor.

63
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,870
能演出舞台剧，你一定很兴奋
This must be exciting for you,being in a real play.

64
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,910
我也演过舞台剧 我是正剧演员
Hey,I've done plays before. I'm a serious actor.

65
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,400
那支公益广告
That infomercial!

66
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,580
倒盒装牛奶那一支
For the milk-carton-spout thing!

67
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,410
你是那个不会倒牛奶的人
You're the guy who doesn't know how to pour milk!

68
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:29,250
我会倒牛奶，我把你骗倒了
I actually can pour milk. But I got you believing that I couldn't.

69
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,080
这就是演技
Now,see,that's acting.

70
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,490
你还被饼干噎到
Right. At the end,you choked on a cookie.

71
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,930
那是真的
That was real.

72
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,430
马克居然约你出去 是啊
-I cannot believe Mark asked you out. -I know.

73
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,470
你要怎么回答？
What are you gonna tell him?

74
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:47,660
我说我会考虑，但是我要拒绝
I told him I would think about it,but I'm gonna tell him no.

75
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,640
我目前不想约会
I think I'd say no to anybody right now.

76
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:59,150
好奇怪，这样一个…
But it was so strange. I mean,I'm standing there...

77
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,750
迷人、英俊的男人约我出去
...with this charming,cute guy who's asking me to go out with him...

78
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,820
而我也可以去
...which I'm allowed to do...

79
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:10,000
但我却有罪恶感 仿佛那样是背叛罗斯
...and I felt guilty,like I'd be cheating on Ross or something.

80
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,760
也许这代表…
Wow. So,okay,maybe that means...

81
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:17,870
你还没有忘情罗斯 而且有父女问题
...you're not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.

82
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,680
我没有父女问题 那就是罗斯的问题了
-I don't have issues with my father. -So it's just the Ross thing.

83
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,980
我恨这个女人，我恨她
I hate this woman! I hate her!

84
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,680
她到处宣传公益广告的事
She told everyone about that infomercial...

85
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:36,020
大家都跑来找我开饮料
...and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks!

86
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:40,560
每次我打不开，他们就笑我
And whenever I can't do it,they're all,like,laughing at me!

87
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,460
瑞秋打电话来
So Rachel called.

88
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,170
说想见我
Wants to see me.

89
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,200
我待会儿就要过去
Going over in a minute.

90
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:58,540
你觉得她有什么事？ 也许是疯狂的烟雾已经消散
-What do you think she wants? -Maybe the crazy fog has lifted...

91
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:01,840
发现没有我的人生…
...and she realizes that life without me...

92
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,210
是糟糕的
...sucks.

93
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,390
有可能，你很可爱 要是我跟你分手，也会想念你
It's possible. You are very lovable. I'd miss you if I broke up with you.

94
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,190
我想表达支持
Just trying to be supportive.

95
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,190
请以男人的方式表达
Be supportive like a guy.

96
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,760
要是我跟你分手，也会想念你
If I broke up with you,I'd miss you.

97
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,900
你想见我？
You wanted to see me?

98
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,540
这一盒是你的东西
Here's a box of your stuff.

99
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:45,020
就是帽子、衣服、CD 一些你留在这里的东西
It's just hats and a shirt and CD's. Just stuff that you've left here.

100
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:49,030
你干什么？想伤害我？
What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me or something?

101
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:59,040
我只是觉得我们该往前走了
It just seems that,you know,it's time we move on.

102
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,760
你不同意吗？
I mean,don't you think?

103
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,870
同意啊 那就好
-Yes,I do. -Good.

104
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,140
我真的同意
I really do.

105
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,940
这是我送你的
This was a gift.

106
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,220
那是博物馆礼品部的赠品
You got that for free from the museum gift shop.

107
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,290
它一样是礼物
It's still a gift.

108
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,990
我是从“礼品部”拿到的
I got it from the "gift" shop.

109
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,790
好，给我，我留着就是了
Okay! All right! Give me the mug! I'll keep the mug!

110
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,470
不必假好心
Don't do me any favors.

111
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,140
既然如此…
In fact...

112
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,570
其他的东西呢？像…
...where's the rest of my stuff? Like my....

113
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,600
这本书是我的
This book is mine!

114
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:44,650
你当成睡衣穿的T恤呢？ 我要拿回来 没错
And that T-shirt you sleep in? I'd like that back too. Yes,I do.

115
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,950
你明知我很喜欢那件衣服 你根本没在穿
You know how much I love that T-shirt. You never even wear that T-shirt.

116
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,820
我是在帮你往前走
I'm just trying to help you "move on."

117
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,320
你真小器
Oh,you are a petty man.

118
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,690
小器…
You are a petty,petty...

119
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,370
小器…
-Petty... -... petty,petty...

120
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,860
小心眼…
-...small.... -...small....

121
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,140
你是故意要气我的
You are so just doing this out of spite.

122
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,340
我会一直穿着，我爱这件衣服
I'm gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!

123
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:20,110
你15岁之后就没穿过了 根本塞不下
You haven't worn it since you were 15! It doesn't even fit you anymore!

124
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,220
（法兰基说：放轻松）

125
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:38,910
不好意思，我要把东西拿走了
If you don't mind,I'm gonna take the rest of my stuff...

126
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,070
我要去放轻松…
...and "relax"...

127
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,470
穿着我最爱的衣服
...in my favorite shirt.

128
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,510
祝你今晚愉快
You have a pleasant evening.

129
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,190
你是亿兆富翁
So you're,like,a zillionaire.

130
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,260
却跟我们差不多大的年纪
And you're our age. You're our age.

131
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,590
你知道吗？你应该买下一个州
You know what? You should buy a state...

132
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,100
取你自己的名字
...and then just name it after yourself.

133
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,070
例如彼达科塔？
Like,"Pete Dakota"?

134
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,400
或是密西西彼特
Or "Mississi-Pete."

135
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,870
我知道了：彼芝加哥
I got it: "Pete Chicago."

136
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,780
芝加哥不是州
That's not a state,Joe.

137
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,720
密西西彼特就是？
Oh,and "Mississi-Pete" is?

138
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,190
我该走了
I gotta go.

139
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,290
改天见
I'll see you guys later.

140
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,120
你跟我们差不多大的年纪
You're our age.

141
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,290
明天再见？
So are we on for tomorrow?

142
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:39,790
好
Absolutely.

143
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,970
快走吧你
Now,get out of here,you!

144
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,370
我快要没地方可以摸了
Okay,I'm running out of places I can touch him.

145
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,540
我有毛病吗？
Is something wrong with me?

146
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,480
我为何总是喜欢没有未来的人
Why am I only attracted to guys with no future?

147
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,380
不是太老，就是太小
Either they're too old,or they're too young.

148
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,580
或者是不尊重妇女的混蛋诗人比如胡里欧
Or they're a big misogynist jerk poet like Julio.

149
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,690
顺便说一下，我还对他有感觉
Who, by the way, l'm still attracted to.

150
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,960
彼特这么喜欢我
And there's Pete,who's crazy about me...

151
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,600
而且这么完美，我们又合得来
...and he's absolutely perfect,and there's zip going on!

152
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,000
我是不是有什么毛病？
Does it sound like something's wrong with me?

153
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,400
好像是
Yeah,kind of.

154
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,580
我应该感到开心吗？
Happy? Is that what I'm supposed to be,Vic?

155
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,140
是吗？
Happy?

156
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,970
不如由你来告诉我
Why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be?

157
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,480
因为我实在搞不懂
Because I sure as hell can't figure it out!

158
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,980
我们的交谈没有感情
I talk to you,and nothing!

159
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,310
你看着我的眼神没有感情
You look at me,and it's nothing!

160
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,190
什么都没有
Nothing.

161
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,920
有意思
Tasty.

162
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:49,730
我开始觉得 你们有渊源了，很好
I'm really starting to feel like you guys have a history. It's nice.

163
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
我对这场戏有个疑问
I have a question about this scene.

164
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:56,840
艾德莉恩为什么会喜欢维克多？
I don't understand why Adrianne's attracted to Victor.

165
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,840
你要拨开洋葱皮
Peel the onion.

166
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,920
第一，他很帅
First of all,he's good-looking.

167
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,580
我的角色需要更好的理由
My character needs a bit more of a reason than that.

168
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,120
这样行不行，因为剧本这么写！
Hey,how about this one? It says so in the script!

169
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,930
我也不知道维克多为什么喜欢你
I don't know why my character likes you either.

170
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,100
剧本上说你是个贱人
I mean,it says in the script that you're a bitch.

171
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:23,230
剧本上没写 我这一本有
-lt doesn't say that in the script. -lt does in mine.

172
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,870
我吹干、上发胶，还是一样
I can blow-dry it,gel it. It doesn't matter.

173
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,940
还是有一撮…
I still wind up with this little...

174
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:35,620
像是被牛舔过的头发，烦死了
...cowlick-y thing on the middle part of my head. It's so annoying.

175
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,980
-你看了烦不烦？ -你比较烦
-Does it bug you? -You bug me.

176
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:54,270
你会不会刚好没看到？
Is there any chance you didn't see that?

177
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,160
罗斯，别再看了
Ross,you gotta stop,okay?

178
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,300
你不能在那里瞄上三小时
You can't stare through the peephole for three hours.

179
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,600
你会得偷窥眼
You're gonna get peep-eye.

180
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,610
我就知道，我就知道她喜欢他
I knew it. I knew it. I always knew she liked him.

181
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:17,640
她一直否认，结果呢 我们才刚分手，她就这么做了
She'd say no,but here we are. We just broke up,first thing she does!

182
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,340
你们没有“才刚分手”
You didn't "just break up."

183
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,450
才三个星期
It's been,like,three weeks!

184
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:25,620
你不到三小时就跟别人上床
You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up.

185
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,190
连子弹都没这么快
I mean,bullets have left guns slower.

186
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,490
他们回来了…
Here they come! Here they

187
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,630
要是她跟他吻别，我会自杀
If she kisses him good night,I'll kill myself.

188
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,360
我看不下去了
I can't watch.

189
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,700
约会该结束了
Come on. Date over! Date over!

190
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,700
没事，她要进去了
Here we go. She's going in.

191
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,540
她要进去了
She's going in.

192
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,640
他也要进去
Wait! He's going in!

193
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,140
他进去了
He's going in!

194
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:53,520
门关了，门关着我看不到
The door's closed! I can't see anything with the door closed!

195
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,480
门的发明者可以安息了
And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.

196
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:00,430
我得想办法阻止
I have to do something. I have to stop it!

197
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,530
阻止什么？ 我不知道
-Stop what? -I don't know.

198
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,390
但只要我过去就行了
But I have a feeling my being there will do it.

199
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:10,030
看，这家伙是个坏消息，钱德， 我能感觉他是个精明的人（有“操作工”的意思）
Look, this guy is bad news, Chandler.l can sense he's an operator.

200
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,710
瑞秋不会跟操作工约会的
Rachel wouldn't date an operator.

201
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,970
他们一年只挣两万块，并且晚上也要工作
They only make 20 grand a year and they have to work nights.

202
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,880
我要过去借东西
I'll go over and I will borrow something!

203
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,950
果汁！我要喝果汁
Juice! I need juice!

204
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,150
不行
You can't!

205
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,550
一定要阻止他们 我是你的朋友
-They must be stopped! -I am your friend...

206
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,790
我不会让你这么做
...and I won't let you do this!

207
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,220
你还真强壮
You are surprisingly strong!

208
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:35,690
我要喝果汁，人都要喝果汁 听我说
-I need juice! People need juice! -Look,man....

209
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,870
人都要喝果汁 听我说！
-People need juice! -Listen to me!

210
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:46,910
她往前走了 就算不是他，也会有别人
She's moving on. If it's not this guy,it's gonna be somebody else.

211
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:50,080
除非你打算租下这个窥视孔
And unless you're thinking about subletting my peephole...

212
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,510
否则你就得面对分手的事实
...you'll have to get used to the fact that it's over!

213
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,480
好吗？结束了
Okay,man? It's over.

214
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,660
我真的很想她
It's just I miss her so much.

215
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,190
我知道
I know.

216
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,770
我知道
I know.

217
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:19,610
只是我这么想，还是说“租下我的偷窥孔”确实听起来很色？
ls it just me, or did ''subletting my peephole'' sound kind of dirty?

218
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,250
咖啡杯为什么有编号？
Why do your coffee mugs have numbers?

219
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,150
这样莫妮卡才方便追踪
Oh,that's so Monica can keep track.

220
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:31,150
要是少了一个 她就可以说27号杯呢？
So if one of them's missing,she can be like,"Where's number 27?"

221
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,170
你知道吗？
You know what?

222
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,100
不知道，也不想知道
No,and I don't think I'm gonna want to.

223
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:48,500
我办不到 我就是不想知道这件事
-I can't do this. -That's what I didn't want to know.

224
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:52,850
我的出发点是错的
Oh,I'm just doing this for the wrong reasons,you know?

225
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,050
我只是想报复罗斯
I'm doing it to get back at Ross.

226
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,840
对不起，这样对你不公平
I'm sorry. It's not very fair to you.

227
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,580
去他的公平
Fair,shmair. You know?

228
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:05,950
你想报复罗斯，尽管找我
You wanna get back at Ross,I am here for you.

229
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,290
真的
Really.

230
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,230
我们就在这张沙发上报复他吧
I say we get back at him right here on this couch. Right here!

231
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:17,030
天哪
Oh,my God.

232
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,300
很抱歉
I'm sorry about this.

233
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,970
没关系
That's okay.

234
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:25,940
你确定？
You sure?

235
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,240
我可以回家自己报复他
I can just go home and get back at him by myself.

236
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,980
将成为21世纪的青霉素
and should become the penicillin of the 2 1st century.

237
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:43,030
所以今天，本院将朝领导改革
And so today,this hospital is about to take major steps...

238
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,700
跨出一大步
...toward leading that revolution.

239
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,960
问你一件事
Can I ask you something?

240
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:53,960
我们在哪里？
Where are we?

241
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,240
有这么多医生、护士在场
Well,with all these doctors and nurses...

242
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,480
应该是小型马术表演
... I'm gonna say,"Midget Rodeo."

243
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,950
跟我说实话
Just tell me the truth.

244
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:11,190
我应该没有告诉你
You know,I don't think I told you this...

245
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:14,760
我刚结束一段很认真的感情
... but I just recently got out of a serious relationship.

246
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,330
一年前对吧？
Oh,right. Wasn't that a year ago?

247
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,960
原来我说过了
So I did tell you.

248
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,730
其实不是这个原因
That's not really the thing.

249
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:28,970
我目前想把注意力 放在自己身上
I'm just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me.

250
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,640
你懂吗？ 我懂
-Do you know what I mean? -Oh,I know.

251
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:38,320
-我也想对你有兴趣 -但是你没有，好
-I so want to be attracted to you. -But you're not. Okay. Good.

252
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,780
对不起
I'm sorry.

253
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,120
不必对不起
You know what? Don't be.

254
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,290
真的，没有那么糟
Don't be,because it's not so bad.

255
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:48,930
真的？
It's not?

256
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:53,650
我又不是约翰邦乔维（最有影响力的流行摇滚歌手）
Yeah. I know I'm no Jon Bon Jovi.

257
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,500
或是什么有魅力的人
Or someone you find attractive.

258
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,600
我只是觉得…
I just think,you know...

259
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,470
你的感觉或许会变
...that you might end up feeling differently.

260
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,780
你别误会
I don't want this to come out wrong...

261
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,980
但是以被拒绝的人来说 你还真有自信
...but you're awfully confident for a guy I said I wasn't attracted to.

262
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,450
傻得很可爱吧？
Stupidly charming,isn't it?

263
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:23,050
要不要去吃饭？ 这里蛮令人沮丧的
You wanna get something to eat? This place is kind of depressing.

264
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,120
我们欢迎促成这件事的功臣 彼特贝克先生
Now the man who made all of this possible,Mr. Peter Becker.

265
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,800
等一下
One second.

266
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:43,240
我不认为这个镇足够大 可以让我们两个在这里休息
I don't think this town is big enough for the both of us to relax in.

267
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,710
拔枪！
Draw!

268
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,220
我什么也没做
I wasn't doing anything.

269
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,160
她又怎么了？
What did she do now?

270
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,100
仅仅因为她来自耶鲁戏剧学院 就认为自己是最伟大的女演员
Just because she went to Yale,she thinks she's the greatest actress...

271
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:10,570
自从有了切片面包以来？（俚语，表示“有史以来”）
...since sliced bread.

272
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:13,770
切片面包 真是伟大的麦克白夫人（莎士比亚戏剧《麦克白》中的恶妇）
Ah,Sliced Bread. A wonderful Lady Macbeth.

273
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:18,210
我恨她，我恨她的 “我好有才华”
I hate her. I hate her with her "Oh,I'm so talented"...

274
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:22,350
“我好漂亮”、“我好香”
...and "Oh,I'm so pretty," and "Oh,I smell so good."

275
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:25,690
有某人喜欢上某人
I think somebody has a crush on somebody.

276
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:30,020
请专心讨论我的问题好吗？
Can we please try and stay focused on my problem here?

277
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:33,560
我就是说你，你这个怪人
I'm talking about you,you big,big freak.

278
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,630
少来了
You're out of your mind!

279
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,600
这48小时以来你开口闭口都是她
You've done nothing but talk about her for 48 hours.

280
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:47,580
要是在学校里你已经 在拉她的辫子、把她推倒在地了
If you were in school,you'd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now.

281
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,110
那为什么我老是想着…
Then how come I keep thinking about her...

282
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,250
要用各种姿势跟她做爱？
...in all these sexual scenarios and stuff?

283
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:03,650
我应该感到开心，是吗？
Happy? Is that what I'm supposed to be,Vic? Happy?

284
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,800
不如由你来告诉我
Why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be,huh?

285
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:09,430
因为我实在搞不懂
Because I sure as hell can't figure it out.

286
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,730
我们的交谈没有感情
I talk to you,and it's nothing.

287
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,640
你看着我的眼神没有感情
You look at me,and nothing.

288
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,180
什么都没有
Nothing.

289
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,850
你们让我爽翻天了
You guys make me fly!

290
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:38,830
爽死了
High!

291
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,870
明天再继续排
Okay,we're gonna pick it up here,tomorrow.

292
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,470
刚才… 好多了？
-Well,that was.... -Better?

293
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,870
对，的确…
Yeah,it was definitely...

294
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,670
有进步
...an improvement.

295
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:56,110
再见 凯特
-Good night. -Kate.

296
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,620
你忘了拿鞋子
You forgot your shoes.

297
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,720
不穿鞋子恐怕不行
I'm probably gonna need those,huh?

298
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:10,990
凯特
Hey,listen...

299
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,330
要不要去喝杯咖啡？
...you feel like getting a cup of coffee?

300
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:16,840
凯特
Kate...

301
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,030
可以走了吗？
...you ready to go?

302
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,140
很好，非常好
Very nice. Very nice.

303
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,210
明天见 好
-See you tomorrow? -Yeah. Sure.

304
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,850
再见 晚安
-Right. -Good night.

305
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,030
为什么没有蜘蛛人？
Why isn't it "Spiderman"?

306
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,530
像是金人、银人
Like Goldman,Silverman?

307
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,740
因为那不是他的姓
Because it's not his last name.

308
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:54,040
不是吗？
It isn't?

309
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,000
他又不叫…
It's not,like...

310
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,900
菲尔蜘蛛人
... Phil Spiderman.

311
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,110
他是个蜘蛛…
He's a Spider-...

312
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,940
人
... man.

313
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:08,080
像金人是姓氏
You know,like,Goldman is a last name.

314
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,790
但是没有金色的人
But there's no Gold Man.

315
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,090
应该会有金色的人
There should be a Gold Man!

316
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,070
工作顺利吗？ 很好
-How was work? -Oh,great.

317
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,200
不过我不小心坐到了地上
Although I did sit down where there wasn't a chair.

318
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,540
罗斯拿了一盒你的东西来
By the way,Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.

319
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:30,800
意料中的事
Oh. Well,I guess I had that one coming.

320
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:34,910
直接扔掉吧，还不是洗发水或者…
I'm just gonna throw it out. It's probably just shampoo and

321
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,050
怎么了？
Something wrong?

322
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,120
没事
No. Nothing.

323
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,070
金人有什么超能力？
So what kind of powers would "Gold Man" have?

324
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:03,480
他能把东西变成金子
Okay. Well,he would turn things to gold.

325
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:08,220
已经是金子的东西呢？ 那就是完成任务了
-And things that are already gold? -His work is done.

326
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,780
我有一个朋友叫吉米塔伯（有“保鲜”的含义） 他有什么能力？
Okay, l have a friend, Jimmy Tupperman,what would his powers be?

327
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:15,420
保鲜人
Tupper Man.

328
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:19,190
他会保持罪犯新鲜直到警察赶来
He would keep criminals fresh until the police came.

329
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,020
来玩我的游戏
Let's play my game.

330
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:28,200
你这个黄色有肚子的，穿制服下垂的…
All right,you yellow-bellied,lily-livered

331
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,460
拔枪！
Draw!
