要是我们的鸡鸭生小宝宝 不是很酷？
Wouldn't it be cool if our duck and our chick had a baby?

2
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:08,682
可以叫它查克
We could call it Chuck.

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,759
或狄克（老二的双关语）
Or Dick.

4
00:00:15,732 --> 00:00:18,064
我要请你们帮忙
Listen, I need a favor.

5
00:00:19,202 --> 00:00:21,602
我刚才洗澡，正在…
I was in the shower, and as I was...

6
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:25,466
洗身体时，发现一件事
...cleansing myself, I felt something.

7
00:00:25,709 --> 00:00:28,701
很像打喷嚏，但是感觉更爽？
Was it like a sneeze, only better?

8
00:00:30,814 --> 00:00:33,112
不是，是我身上长了东西
No. I mean, like, a thing on my body.

9
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:34,977
什么东西？
Well, what was it?

10
00:00:35,218 --> 00:00:38,881
不晓得，它长在我不能…
Well, I don't know. It's kind of in a place that's not....

11
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:43,116
我看不到，我想麻烦你们
It's not visually accessible to me. And I was hoping maybe you guys...

12
00:00:43,393 --> 00:00:44,587
帮我看一下
...could help me out.

13
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,557
拜托，又没什么
Come on, you guys! It's no big deal!

14
00:00:53,903 --> 00:00:56,633
是什么？是痣吗？
Well, what is it? Is it a mole?

15
00:00:58,341 --> 00:01:01,003
不是，太皱了，不是痣
No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.

16
00:01:01,277 --> 00:01:03,108
那是痘子吗？
Is it? What, a pimple?

17
00:01:06,516 --> 00:01:07,676
不是，它…
No, it's...

18
00:01:08,284 --> 00:01:10,252
比青春痘高级
...fancier than a pimple.

19
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,785
你就去看医… 你们在干…
-Ross, just go see a doc -Guys, what's?

20
00:01:18,428 --> 00:01:21,329
确定了，冬天还有两星期
Well, it's definite. Two more weeks of winter.

21
00:01:21,531 --> 00:01:22,327
没错
Yeah, right.

这是咖啡馆，我都在这里表演
And this is the coffeehouse. This is where I play my music.

25
00:02:18,588 --> 00:02:20,613
漂亮 他们是我的朋友
-Good deal. -These are my friends.

26
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,018
各位，这是文斯 文斯，我的朋友
People? This is Vince. Vince, the people.

27
00:02:25,962 --> 00:02:27,452
文斯是消防员
Vince is a fireman.

28
00:02:28,698 --> 00:02:31,166
你从燃烧的大楼里救过人吗？
Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building?

29
00:02:31,434 --> 00:02:33,800
九十八次，队上第一高
Ninety-eight hot saves. Highest on the force.

30
00:02:34,003 --> 00:02:37,996
要是乔伊和我玩火柴 就可以让你累积到一百
If Joey and I play with matches, we could get you up to an even 100.

31
00:02:40,109 --> 00:02:42,339
孩子，不能拿火灾开玩笑
Fire safety is not a joke, son.

32
00:02:44,848 --> 00:02:46,475
你说得对，我知道
You're right. I know.

33
00:02:47,684 --> 00:02:49,811
我要走了，晚上要值班
Look, I gotta go. I'm on call tonight.

34
00:02:50,119 --> 00:02:51,108
星期六见
See you Saturday.

35
00:02:54,624 --> 00:02:55,784
菲比，他好可爱
He's cute, Pheebs.

36
00:02:56,059 --> 00:02:58,118
但你不是刚和那个老师交往？
But you just started dating that teacher.

37
00:02:58,328 --> 00:02:59,226
杰森？
Oh, Jason?

38
00:02:59,529 --> 00:03:01,360
我们晚上要见面
We're seeing each other tonight.

39
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:03,292
菲比？
Well, Pheebs?

40
00:03:03,633 --> 00:03:06,227
脚踏两条船？你不像这种人
Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.

41
00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:09,666
我也知道 我在游戏人间
I know, I know. I'm, like, playing the field.

42
00:03:09,906 --> 00:03:13,808
我在玩弄别人，搞七捻三
I'm juggling two guys. I'm sowing my wild oats.

43
00:03:14,244 --> 00:03:18,374
我是搞七捻三的花心萝N
You know, this kind of, like, oat-sowing, field-playing juggler.

44
00:03:18,715 --> 00:03:20,512
他们知道对方的存在吗？
So do they know about each other?

45
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,482
狗狗念书时，嘴唇会动吗？
Does a dog's lips move when he reads?

46
00:03:27,857 --> 00:03:29,848
他们不知道
Okay, no, they don't know.

47
00:03:31,928 --> 00:03:33,190
各位
Hey, guys.

48
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:38,390
怎么样？ 医生怎么说？
-Well? -How'd it go at the doctor's?

49
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:42,537
他说不用担心，是良性的
He said there's definitely nothing to worry about. It's benign.

50
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:44,900
是什么？ 他根本说不出来
-What is it? -He couldn't even tell me.

51
00:03:45,174 --> 00:03:50,271
他只说是一种皮肤异常
He said it was just some sort of "skin abnormality."

52
00:03:51,114 --> 00:03:54,447
更糟的是他说，由于无法辨认
The worse thing is, he said, being unable to identify it...

53
00:03:54,751 --> 00:03:56,582
他不愿意为我切除
... he was reluctant to remove it.

54
00:03:56,886 --> 00:03:58,251
你应该去找我的医生
You should go to my guy.

55
00:03:58,521 --> 00:04:00,955
我带着第三个乳头去找他时
Because when I went in there with my third nipple...

56
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:04,250
他直接就把它给切了
...he just lopped it right off.

57
00:04:04,594 --> 00:04:06,357
我蛮幸运的
So I guess I'm lucky.

58
00:04:06,596 --> 00:04:10,726
虽然比不上天生两个乳头的人
I mean, not as lucky as people who are born with two nipples.

59
00:04:11,367 --> 00:04:15,303
至少他们知道你长了什么 你的有名字
At least they knew what yours was. You know? Yours had a name.

60
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:18,639
也许医学界会以你为名
Maybe they'll name yours after you.

61
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,570
把它叫做“罗斯”
You know? They'd call it "The Ross."

62
00:04:22,145 --> 00:04:25,945
大家会说 咳，他长了一个罗斯
And then people would be, like, "Oh, he's got a Ross."

63
00:04:27,483 --> 00:04:29,280
是啊，真酷
Yeah, that'd be cool.

64
00:04:31,387 --> 00:04:33,048
彼特要跟我分手
Pete's breaking up with me.

65
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:34,153
什么？
What?

66
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,585
我刚才听留言
I just checked my messages.

67
00:04:36,826 --> 00:04:40,091
他说等他回来 “我们得谈一谈”
He said that when he gets back, "We need to talk."

68
00:04:40,563 --> 00:04:42,053
然后呢？ 就这样
-And? -Well, that's it.

69
00:04:42,265 --> 00:04:45,666
没有人会说“我们得谈一谈” 除非是坏事
People never say, "We need to talk," unless it's something bad.

70
00:04:45,902 --> 00:04:48,666
那不一定代表他要跟你分手
That doesn't necessarily mean he's breaking up with you.

71
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:50,169
真的？
Really?

72
00:04:50,406 --> 00:04:52,499
也许他只是对你不忠
Maybe he just cheated on you.

73
00:04:57,814 --> 00:05:01,250
这么做没有好处 但我还是很高兴
I won't get rich doing it, but I gotta say, it's cool...

74
00:05:01,517 --> 00:05:04,350
我改变了一个孩子
... knowing you're making a difference in a kid's life.

75
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,611
真好
That is so great.

76
00:05:08,024 --> 00:05:09,321
天哪
Oh, my God!

77
00:05:09,826 --> 00:05:11,123
天哪
Oh, my God!

78
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:13,192
赶快通知消防队
We'd better call the fire department.

79
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,455
不必找消防员吧
Well, we don't need a fireman.

80
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:19,532
应该找好的黑手来
We need, like, a good mechanic.

81
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,634
他们来了，快逃
Here they come! We gotta get out of here!

82
00:05:23,873 --> 00:05:24,703
等一下，为什么？
Wait. Why?

83
00:05:24,974 --> 00:05:27,602
要是我想看消防员 我会找消防员约会
If I wanted to see a fireman, I'd date one.

84
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,314
只是一个多出来的乳头
That's all it is. A third nipple.

85
00:05:32,548 --> 00:05:36,109
很普通的第三个乳头
You know? Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple.

86
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,811
你可以把它切掉，直接切掉
You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off.

87
00:05:40,056 --> 00:05:43,184
把上衣脱掉让我看一下
Take your shirt off. Let's see what we're dealing with.

88
00:05:45,895 --> 00:05:47,453
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

89
00:05:48,398 --> 00:05:52,892
让你看那个非常普通 可以直接切掉的乳头
Just showing you my run-of-the-mill, slice-it-right-off third nipple.

90
00:05:53,136 --> 00:05:55,696
这不是第三个乳头
Well, that's not a third nipple.

91
00:05:55,905 --> 00:05:58,339
首先，它长在屁股上
First of all, it's on your ass.

92
00:05:59,342 --> 00:06:00,741
不然是什么？
Well, then what is it?

93
00:06:01,344 --> 00:06:03,141
等一下
Wait a minute. Hold it.

94
00:06:05,381 --> 00:06:07,815
詹森，来一下 我在跟汉弥顿讲话
-Jansen, come in here. -I'm with Hamilton!

95
00:06:08,418 --> 00:06:10,852
他对怪东西很在行，叫他也来
He's good with weird things. Bring him in too.

96
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:15,648
我得去帮彼特浇花
I gotta go water Pete's plants.

97
00:06:15,858 --> 00:06:20,022
你们知道吗？ 如果他想分手，我就不浇了
You know what? If he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water them.

98
00:06:20,263 --> 00:06:24,029
如果他要分手 干脆让乔伊和我去“浇”
If he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should do it...

99
00:06:27,003 --> 00:06:29,028
懂我的意思吧？
...if you know what I mean.

100
00:06:29,572 --> 00:06:30,436
或者…
Or...

101
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,103
我们可以去对着花盆撒尿
...we could go and pee on them.

102
00:06:36,345 --> 00:06:38,006
我受不了了
I can't take it, you know.

103
00:06:38,281 --> 00:06:41,114
我好怕会被捉到
I'm afraid one of them will catch me with the other.

104
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,749
我快疯了
It's making me crazy!

105
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:45,044
何不跟其中一个分手？
Why don't you break up with one of them?

106
00:06:46,522 --> 00:06:49,787
你不是在游戏人间？
What happened to playing the field?

107
00:06:50,059 --> 00:06:52,186
现在不像游戏了
It doesn't feel like playing anymore.

108
00:06:52,428 --> 00:06:55,454
比较像工作 我好像在做田野调查
It's feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field.

109
00:06:56,532 --> 00:06:58,022
那就选一个
So pick one of them.

110
00:06:58,234 --> 00:06:59,360
你比较喜欢哪一个？
Which one do you like more?

111
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:04,006
文斯很棒，他是男人中的男人
Vince is great, you know? Because he's, like, a "guy" guy.

112
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,074
他好壮，真的好壮
He's just so burly, so very burly.

113
00:07:09,912 --> 00:07:12,904
好，那就选文斯吧
Okay, good. So there you go. Go with Vince.

114
00:07:13,116 --> 00:07:14,708
但是杰森好感性
But Jason's really sensitive.

115
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:16,851
感性很重要，选他
Sensitive is important. Pick him.

116
00:07:18,387 --> 00:07:20,912
是啊，听娘娘腔的话
Oh, sure. Go with the sissy.

117
00:07:22,425 --> 00:07:24,620
杰森才不娘娘腔
Jason is not a sissy.

118
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:26,718
我是说钱德
I meant Chandler.

119
00:07:37,807 --> 00:07:40,537
我晚上有约
You know, I have dinner plans.

120
00:07:41,777 --> 00:07:45,304
谢谢各位临时赶来
Thank you so much for coming on such a short notice.

121
00:07:45,581 --> 00:07:50,541
各位先生、女士 我行医23年
Ladies and gentlemen, I've been practicing medicine for 23 years...

122
00:07:50,786 --> 00:07:52,151
现在却被难倒了
...and I'm stumped.

123
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,898
这里是书房
Okay, this is the den.

124
00:08:06,135 --> 00:08:08,433
你们看喔…灯光
All right, check this out. Lights!

125
00:08:09,338 --> 00:08:12,171
少一点光…不好的光
All right, less lights! Bad lights!

126
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:13,499
灯光走开
Lights, go away!

127
00:08:16,012 --> 00:08:18,344
看到了吗？下对指令就行了
See? You just need the right command.

128
00:08:19,148 --> 00:08:21,139
也可以用调的
And the dimmer switch.

129
00:08:22,518 --> 00:08:24,645
他那么有钱，电视还真小
For a rich guy, that's a small TV.

130
00:08:24,887 --> 00:08:26,445
那是视讯电话
That's the video phone.

131
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:29,556
你们不能来的，所以不要乱碰
But you shouldn't be here. So don't touch anything.

132
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,891
宜家砭悖好舒服
IKEA, this is comfortable!

133
00:08:34,897 --> 00:08:37,058
这里太高级了
This place is amazing!

134
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,030
那个厨房好棒 我知道
-Oh, God! That's the nicest kitchen. -I know.

135
00:08:40,236 --> 00:08:41,498
我是褚的
It's the nicest kitchen.

136
00:08:41,737 --> 00:08:44,137
冰箱还会祝我今天愉快
The refrigerator told me to have a great day.

137
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,809
你们看，百万富翁的支票簿
Look, a millionaire's checkbook.

138
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,375
乔伊，放下
Joey, put that down.

139
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,071
天哪，是彼特，快出去！
Oh, my God, that's Pete. Get out!

140
00:08:53,349 --> 00:08:55,840
视讯电话要怎么接？
How the hell do you answer a video phone?

141
00:08:59,255 --> 00:09:00,688
原来是这样
I guess that's how.

142
00:09:01,157 --> 00:09:02,886
摩妮卡，你好吗？
Monica, how's it going?

143
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:05,389
很好
Oh, it's good. It's good.

144
00:09:05,595 --> 00:09:07,358
我来帮你浇花
Just here, watering the plants.

145
00:09:07,563 --> 00:09:09,724
别忘了瑞秋旁边那一盆
Don't forget that ficus there by Rachel.

146
00:09:12,435 --> 00:09:13,834
钱德在沙发上
Chandler's on the couch!

147
00:09:15,838 --> 00:09:18,500
我看到了，你们还真不会躲
I see him. You guys are the worst hiders, ever.

148
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,506
嗨 你好吗？
-Hi. -How you doing?

149
00:09:23,613 --> 00:09:26,446
那天你说要找我谈一谈
The other day when you said you needed to talk...

150
00:09:26,682 --> 00:09:29,412
请问是好消息还是坏消息？
...just so I know, is it good news or bad news?

151
00:09:29,619 --> 00:09:32,019
好消息，绝对是好消息
It's good news. It's definitely good news.

152
00:09:32,555 --> 00:09:34,921
等一下，有另一通电话
Hold on a second, I have another call.

153
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:36,351
你好吗？
How's it going?

154
00:09:37,093 --> 00:09:38,253
还是我
It's still me.

155
00:09:38,594 --> 00:09:40,425
我这里有子画面
I've got picture-in-picture here.

156
00:09:42,798 --> 00:09:45,892
我再回你电话
I'm gonna have to call you back later.

157
00:09:46,535 --> 00:09:49,231
摩妮卡？我再回你电话
Monica? You. I'm gonna have to call you back.

158
00:09:49,772 --> 00:09:51,399
改天见
So I'll see you soon.

159
00:09:51,707 --> 00:09:53,572
好，我爱你 我爱你
-Okay. I love you. -I love you.

160
00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:56,073
我们也爱你
We love you too!

161
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,842
是好消息，是好消息
Well, it's good news. It's good news.

162
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,213
你想是什么好消息？ 你们看
-What do you think the good news is? -Look at this!

163
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:08,720
他开了一张五万元的支票 给一位戒指设计师
He wrote a check for $50,000 to "Hugo Lindgren's Ring Design."

164
00:10:10,893 --> 00:10:13,726
对不起，你想是什么好消息？
Sorry. What do you think the good news is?

165
00:10:15,765 --> 00:10:16,823
天哪
Oh, my!

166
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:18,964
摩妮卡要嫁给百万富翁了
Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!

167
00:10:19,669 --> 00:10:22,900
赶快打给妈，打给妈！打给妈
You gotta get Mom on the phone! Call Mom! Call Mom!

168
00:10:25,675 --> 00:10:27,404
那是彼特的妈妈
And that's Pete's mom.

169
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:37,644
你得办一个主题婚礼 主题可以是…
You have to make it a theme wedding. And the theme could be:

170
00:10:37,853 --> 00:10:39,912
“看我们多有钱啊”
"Look How Much Money We've Got!"

171
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,522
你可以在喜帖里放钱
I mean, you could put money in the invitations.

172
00:10:44,827 --> 00:10:47,421
你可以用钱做成餐具
You could have, like, little-money place settings.

173
00:10:47,663 --> 00:10:50,223
第一道菜可以上钞票沙拉
And you could start with a money salad.

174
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:53,434
虽然干了点，绝对受欢迎
I mean, it'll be dry, but people will like it.

175
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:54,896
别再说了
Would you stop?

176
00:10:55,104 --> 00:10:56,765
我们才交往两星期
We've only gone out a couple of weeks.

177
00:10:57,006 --> 00:10:58,439
也不知道他会不会求婚
We don't know if he'll propose.

178
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,006
他是彼特，跟别人不一样
But this is Pete. He's not like other people.

179
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,074
你们第一次约会就去罗马
On your first date, you went to Rome.

180
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,215
对其他男人来说 那是第三、四次约会的事
For most guys, that's like a third or fourth date kind of thing.

181
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:11,213
如果他要求婚，那就太夸张了
Well, if that's what it is, then it's crazy.

182
00:11:11,787 --> 00:11:14,517
摩妮卡说得对 这可是婚姻大事
Monica's right. We're talking about marriage here.

183
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,191
她不能说嫁就嫁
She can't just rush into this.

184
00:11:17,393 --> 00:11:20,191
你懂什么？你娶了一个女同志
What do you know? You married a lesbian!

185
00:11:26,202 --> 00:11:28,602
我要走了，我要去跟文斯分手
I gotta go. I have to break up with Vince.

186
00:11:28,804 --> 00:11:30,931
你选了那个老师？
So you're going with the teacher?

187
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,940
我很喜欢文斯，但杰森好感性
I like Vince a lot, you know? But Jason is so sensitive.

188
00:11:35,144 --> 00:11:38,580
长期来说，感性应该比…
In the long run, I think sensitive is better than having...

189
00:11:38,814 --> 00:11:42,443
身材很猛来得好
...a really, really, really nice body.

190
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,317
杰森，绝对是杰森
Jason. Definitely Jason.

191
00:11:48,557 --> 00:11:50,582
祝我好运 祝你好运
-Wish me luck! -Good luck!

192
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,391
万岁！
Oh, my God!

193
00:11:57,266 --> 00:11:58,096
对不起
Sorry.

194
00:11:58,334 --> 00:12:01,667
我在想像接到钞票捧花的感觉
I was imagining what it'd be like to catch the money bouquet.

195
00:12:07,676 --> 00:12:09,906
抱歉，文斯在吗？
Excuse me. Is Vince here?

196
00:12:10,179 --> 00:12:11,237
在
Oh, sure.

197
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,579
我不晓得你们会真的滑下来
I didn't know you guys actually used those.

198
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:20,819
什么事？
So what's up?

199
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:26,861
这件事很难启齿
This isn't gonna be easy.

200
00:12:28,097 --> 00:12:31,089
我们还是别再见面了
I don't think we should see each other anymore.

201
00:12:34,036 --> 00:12:35,264
很好
Good deal.

202
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:37,536
对不起
I'm sorry.

203
00:12:37,807 --> 00:12:38,705
没关系
No, it's okay.

204
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:43,805
我还以为我们之间很特别
It's just that I thought we had something pretty special here.

205
00:12:44,046 --> 00:12:48,142
我终于找到可以倾诉的对象
I felt like you were someone I could finally open up to.

206
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,683
我还有好多事没跟你分享
There's so much in me I haven't shared with you yet.

207
00:12:51,987 --> 00:12:53,784
天哪，我不知道你…
My God! I didn't know you were so

208
00:12:53,989 --> 00:12:55,854
抱歉，我说不出话来了
I'm sorry. I can't talk.

209
00:12:57,827 --> 00:13:00,057
我要去写日记
I'm gonna go write in my journal.

210
00:13:03,632 --> 00:13:04,894
等一下
Wait! Wait! Wait!

211
00:13:05,901 --> 00:13:07,334
“中央公园”

212
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:11,301
你如果想解决那个问题 就去找我的药草师
If you wanna take care of that thing, go see my herbal guy.

213
00:13:11,907 --> 00:13:15,035
谢了，我是想切除 不是想做成香料
Thanks. But I wanna remove it, not make it savory.

214
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:21,042
女生发现情人身上长了怪东西
When girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body...

215
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:23,376
都会跟朋友广播
...they tell their friends about it.

216
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,414
拿来
Give me that.

217
00:13:28,524 --> 00:13:32,426
别生我的气，我就是忍不住
Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist.

218
00:13:32,661 --> 00:13:33,855
“新娘杂志”？
Bride's Magazines?

219
00:13:34,096 --> 00:13:36,724
我知道你不会答应求婚
I know you said you'd say no if he asked you...

220
00:13:36,932 --> 00:13:40,060
但是穿这套唐娜凯伦走红毯
... but how great would you look walking down the aisle...

221
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:42,328
会有多美啊
...in this Donna Karan?

222
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,097
一定会很美
You so would!

223
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,235
不结婚也要买
You should get that anyway.

224
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:50,935
可以穿去俱乐部
Well, for clubbing.

225
00:13:52,114 --> 00:13:53,411
很奇怪
It is so weird.

226
00:13:53,616 --> 00:13:56,608
我说过不会答应 但是今天早上…
I know what I said. But this morning...

227
00:13:56,852 --> 00:14:00,288
我躺在床上 想像说“愿意”的感觉
...I was lying in bed, imagining what it'd be like to say yes.

228
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:06,360
我知道有点突然，也很匆促
I know it's a little sudden, and it's rushed...

229
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:09,223
我也不是会做这种事的人
...and it's not like me to do something like this.

230
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:12,400
但我可以这么做，对吧？
But it doesn't mean I can't. Right?

231
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,364
毕竟我那么爱彼特
I mean, I'm crazy about Pete.

232
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:17,403
我们追求同样的东西
And I know that we want the same things.

233
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,904
当我想到说“愿意”的感觉
And when I thought about saying yes...

234
00:14:20,142 --> 00:14:21,905
我觉得很快乐
...it made me really happy.

235
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,442
天哪
Oh, my God!

236
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,407
我知道
I know.

237
00:14:27,383 --> 00:14:28,247
我还要派
I need more pie.

238
00:14:31,253 --> 00:14:35,155
要是你真的结婚 我可以带两个人去吗？
Mon, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?

239
00:14:38,093 --> 00:14:40,288
你没跟消防员分手？
You didn't break up with that fireman?

240
00:14:40,563 --> 00:14:42,121
我就是这个意思
That was my way of telling you.

241
00:14:43,232 --> 00:14:45,723
原来他非常感性
Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive.

242
00:14:45,935 --> 00:14:48,096
他写日记，还画画
He keeps a journal and he paints.

243
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:51,239
他还为我画了一幅炭笔画
He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.

244
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:55,842
他比较想用水彩画 但是手边有很多黑炭
He'd prefer watercolors, but he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.

245
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,346
那你要甩掉杰森吗？
So will you dump Jason?

246
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,914
对，我总得跟其中一个分手
Yeah, because I have to break up with someone.

247
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:08,112
杰森很感性，但文斯也是
So Jason is sensitive. But now, so is Vince.

248
00:15:08,357 --> 00:15:10,518
而文斯又有身材
Plus, Vince has the body. You know?

249
00:15:10,793 --> 00:15:11,817
所以…
So....

250
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,627
这是算术问题
It's really just about the math.

251
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,800
请进
Come on in.

252
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,215
你在电话里的语气很严肃
You sounded serious on the phone.

253
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,315
出了什么事吗？
Is anything wrong?

254
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,896
你一定是罗斯
You must be Ross.

255
00:16:00,409 --> 00:16:02,502
我是萨吉大师
I am Guru Saj.

256
00:16:04,246 --> 00:16:09,115
老实说，我没找过大师 所以…
Listen, I gotta tell you, I've never been to a guru before, so....

257
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:10,250
放轻松
Well, relax.

258
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:13,079
我在中部念过很好的医学院
If it makes you feel any better, I've attended...

259
00:16:13,355 --> 00:16:15,653
这样你比较安心了吧
...fine medical schools in Central America.

260
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,725
来看看你的皮肤异常吧
Well, let's take a look at this skin abnormality of yours.

261
00:16:19,995 --> 00:16:21,656
请坐
Come on, have a seat.

262
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:28,665
跟我想的一样，是昆度斯
As I suspected, it's a kundus.

263
00:16:31,173 --> 00:16:32,265
什么是昆度斯？
What's a "kundus"?

264
00:16:32,508 --> 00:16:35,875
不晓得，对你来说是什么？
I don't know. What's a kundus with you?

265
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:41,507
请趴下
Please lie down.

266
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:45,614
我有一种药膏可以让它缩小
I've got a salve that ought to shrink that right up.

267
00:16:45,888 --> 00:16:47,753
值得一试
I guess it's worth a try.

268
00:16:47,956 --> 00:16:49,685
那当然，效果应该…
Sure. We should see results

269
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:52,556
显然不能这么做
Clearly not the way to go!

270
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,461
为什么？
What? What?

271
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,925
我们似乎惹火它了
We appear to have angered it.

272
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,300
我们惹火它了？
We? We angered it?

273
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,629
我看到症结了
I think I see the problem.

274
00:17:05,207 --> 00:17:08,699
我们得动用更有力的手段
And I'm afraid we're gonna have to use a much stronger tool.

275
00:17:10,546 --> 00:17:11,604
爱
Love.

276
00:17:13,048 --> 00:17:14,140
拜托
Oh, God!

277
00:17:16,218 --> 00:17:19,813
它绝对不可能脱落
There is absolutely no way this is gonna come off...

278
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:21,556
除非你用…
... unless you start to....

279
00:17:22,224 --> 00:17:24,089
怎么了？
What was that?

280
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,120
它掉下来了
Well, it's gone.

281
00:17:27,896 --> 00:17:28,794
怎么会？
How's that?

282
00:17:29,398 --> 00:17:30,990
被我的手表刮掉了
Got caught in my watch.

283
00:17:36,572 --> 00:17:37,596
灯光
Lights.

284
00:17:39,074 --> 00:17:40,769
浪漫的灯光
Romantic lights.

285
00:17:42,277 --> 00:17:43,266
真好
Nice.

286
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,638
我说过有事情要告诉你
So there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about.

287
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:51,780
对喔，我都忘了
Oh, right. I'd completely forgot about that.

288
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,854
我最近想了很多
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

289
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,021
我检讨我的人生
And I look at my life...

290
00:18:00,763 --> 00:18:04,028
觉得我已经征服了商场
...and I feel like I've conquered the business world.

291
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,969
我已经征服了知识界
And I feel like I've conquered the intellectual world.

292
00:18:09,037 --> 00:18:12,438
现在又拥有世界上最美的女人
And now I have the most beautiful woman in the world.

293
00:18:15,778 --> 00:18:17,439
但是还有一个缺撼
But there's one thing missing.

294
00:18:18,814 --> 00:18:20,008
什么缺撼？
What's that?

295
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:24,642
我该征服体育界了
It's time for me to conquer the physical world.

296
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,289
我想成为…
I wanna become...

297
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,395
终极格斗冠军
...the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

298
00:18:37,633 --> 00:18:38,998
你想怎样？
You wanna what?

299
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,295
我想成为终极格斗冠军
I wanna be the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

300
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,371
那是全世界最激烈的体能竞技
It's the most intense physical competition in the world.

301
00:18:45,574 --> 00:18:47,007
在四十九州被禁
It's banned in 49 states.

302
00:18:47,676 --> 00:18:49,405
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

303
00:18:49,678 --> 00:18:51,612
我的教练正在教我…
My trainer, Hoshi, is teaching me...

304
00:18:51,814 --> 00:18:54,078
截拳道和巴西街头搏击
...Jeet Kune Do and Brazilian streetfighting.

305
00:18:54,316 --> 00:18:57,513
我还请人设计了 专用的八角训练场
I even had my own octagon training ring designed.

306
00:18:57,753 --> 00:19:00,745
所以你找了设计师 （戒指字同拳击场）
And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.

307
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,857
我要你在最前排看我赢得胜利
I want you there, in the front row, when I win.

308
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:09,553
我要你近得可以闻到血腥味
I want you close enough to smell the blood.

309
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:12,895
你意下如何？
What do you think?

310
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,697
我的父母会很高兴
My parents will be so happy.

311
00:19:21,977 --> 00:19:24,810
疯狂的内裤，爬上我的屁股
Crazy underwear Creeping up my butt

312
00:19:26,682 --> 00:19:30,015
疯狂的内裤，总是一成不变
Crazy underwear Always in a rut

313
00:19:30,686 --> 00:19:32,984
疯狂的内裤…
Crazy underwear

314
00:19:36,325 --> 00:19:38,020
他来干什么？
What is he doing here?

315
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,251
继续唱
All right, just keep playing.

316
00:19:40,495 --> 00:19:43,089
你会安全过关，不会有事
You'll get through this. You'll be fine.

317
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,568
谢谢大家
Okay, thank you.

318
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:59,274
依照惯例 演唱完不要跟我说话
And as always, no one talk to me after the show.

319
00:20:04,386 --> 00:20:06,513
我刚好路过，看到你在表演
I was passing by and saw you were playing.

320
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:09,052
你在台上的感觉好棒
This is cool, seeing you up there.

321
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,421
怎么回事？他是谁？
What's going on here? Who's this guy?

322
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,956
我不知道，他突然跑来亲我 快捉住他
I don't know! He just started kissing me. Get him, Vince!

323
00:20:20,936 --> 00:20:22,267
什么？
What?

324
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,770
我同时跟你们交往
I've been dating both of you.

325
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:30,236
这种感觉很差，因为…
And it's been really horrible, because it's been...

326
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,379
实在很过瘾
...a lot of fun for me.

327
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:38,442
你们两个我都喜欢
But I like you both...

328
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,915
我不知道该选谁
...and I didn't know how to choose.

329
00:20:41,223 --> 00:20:44,989
对不起，我很差劲 我太差劲了
So I'm sorry. I'm terrible. I'm a terrible person.

330
00:20:46,094 --> 00:20:48,619
别这样，没关系
Relax. It's okay. I mean....

331
00:20:48,897 --> 00:20:51,229
我们又没说只能跟彼此交往
We never said this was exclusive.

332
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,128
我们也是，你别太自责
Neither did we. So give yourself a break.

333
00:20:55,237 --> 00:20:56,295
真的？
Really?

334
00:20:57,472 --> 00:20:59,667
我们交往的时间又不长
We haven't been going out that long.

335
00:20:59,975 --> 00:21:02,603
甚至还没上过床
Come on, we haven't even slept together yet.

336
00:21:03,412 --> 00:21:04,845
你们没有？
You haven't?

337
00:21:07,616 --> 00:21:08,446
你们有？
You have?

338
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,914
这是你们的问题
Well, this is none of my business.

339
00:21:13,755 --> 00:21:16,815
我真不敢相信 你跟他上床了？
I can't believe this! You slept with him?

340
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:19,821
我陪你在公园吃过烛光晚餐啊
Well, I made you a candlelight dinner in the park.

341
00:21:21,997 --> 00:21:25,091
我来替你省掉一个麻烦
I'm gonna make this real easy for you.

342
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:33,204
幸好没有太难看
That could've been really awkward.

343
00:21:36,345 --> 00:21:39,508
你陪他在公园吃烛光晚餐？
You made him a candlelight dinner in the park?

344
00:21:39,781 --> 00:21:43,182
我也可以陪你吃，我会陪你吃
Yeah, but I can do that for you. I'm gonna do that for you.

345
00:21:43,452 --> 00:21:45,886
我居然跟一个…
I can't believe I went out with somebody...

346
00:21:46,188 --> 00:21:49,680
在林木区点火的人交往
...who'd have an open flame in the middle of a wooded area!

347
00:21:59,101 --> 00:22:01,592
不会有事的
Everything's gonna be all right.

348
00:22:02,704 --> 00:22:04,262
好吗，狄克？
Okay, Dick?

349
00:22:07,275 --> 00:22:09,209
你们好，我是萨吉大师
Hello. I am Guru Saj.

350
00:22:12,714 --> 00:22:15,182
他是鸭子吧？否则…
He's a duck, right? Because otherwise...

351
00:22:15,384 --> 00:22:17,409
就超出我的能力范围了
...this is way out of my league.

352
00:22:18,353 --> 00:22:22,312
他咳得很严重，兽医治不好
He's got a really bad cough, and our vet can't stop it.

353
00:22:22,524 --> 00:22:24,287
你有办法吗？
Is there something you can do?

354
00:22:24,693 --> 00:22:26,160
我看看
Let me see.

355
00:22:26,995 --> 00:22:28,656
我看看
Let me see.

356
00:22:30,699 --> 00:22:33,395
你能让他吃下蝙蝠吗？
Do you think you could get him to eat a bat?
