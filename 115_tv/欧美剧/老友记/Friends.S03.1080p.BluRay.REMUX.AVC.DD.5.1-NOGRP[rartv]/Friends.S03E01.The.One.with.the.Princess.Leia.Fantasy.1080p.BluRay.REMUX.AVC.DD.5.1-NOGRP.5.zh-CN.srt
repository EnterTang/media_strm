1
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,960
那个女孩一定在跟我使眼色 她才没有
-She totally winked at me! -She did not wink at you.

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:08,700
你总是以为 别人在跟你使眼色
You always think somebody's winking at you.

3
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,650
本集播出： “莉亚公主的幻想”
The One With the Princess Leia Fantasy

4
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,030
我会认为是 范莫里森（爱尔兰民谣歌手）的“土波罗蜜”
I say "Tupelo Honey" by Van Morrison.

5
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,500
不会吧！
No way!

6
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,600
我会认为 最浪漫的曲子是“往日情怀”
The most romantic song ever was "The Way We Were."

7
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,610
我觉得是艾尔顿约翰为连续剧《妙管家》里的家伙写的歌
I think the one that Elton John wrote for that guy on Who's the Boss?

8
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,170
那是什么歌？
What song was that?

9
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,280
“抱紧我，年轻的汤尼丹佐”（应该是“抱紧我，小舞者”）
Hold me close Young Tony Danza

10
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,920
莫妮卡 莫妮卡
-Hi,Monica. -Hi,Mon.

11
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,490
天啊
Oh,my God!

12
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,630
她到底有没有睡觉？
Has she slept at all?

13
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,600
没有 已经连续三个晚上了
It's been three nights in a row.

14
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,770
从昨天起，她终于不哭了
She finally stopped crying yesterday.

15
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,770
但是她又在阳台发现 理查抽过的雪茄
But then she found one of Richard's cigar butts on the terrace....

16
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,540
好吧，这说明了为何我在 清晨两点接到一通电话
Okay,that explains it. I got a call at 2 in the morning...

17
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,210
而我只能听到一些吱吱的声音
...and all I could hear was this squeaky sound.

18
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,810
我就想“一定是老鼠或负鼠”
So I thought,"It's a mouse or a possum."

19
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,710
然后我就想，好吧…
Then I realized,like,okay...

20
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:09,890
老鼠或负鼠怎么会 有钱打电话呢？
...where would a mouse or a possum get the money to make the phone call?

21
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,520
早安 早啊
-Morning. -Morning.

22
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,060
你做了松饼啊？
You made pancakes?

23
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,000
是啊，你还以为我真的会做呢
Yeah,like there's any way I could ever do that.

24
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,630
莫妮卡和瑞秋有糖浆
Monica and Rachel had syrup

25
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,070
我可以让我的男人开心了
Now I can get my man to cheer up

26
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,910
早安，乔伊
Good morning,Joey.

27
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,180
早安
Good morning.

28
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,540
有人穿着坏脾气的裤子哦
Someone's wearing grumpy pants.

29
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,850
那一定说的是你，我穿着傲慢无礼的裤子
lt's gotta be you, man.l'm wearing smarty-pants.

30
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,890
好了，开始了，一，二
Okay, here we go: One, two...

31
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:48,290
侥幸给你第三个
...and here's my chance to give you a third one.

32
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,800
-乔伊？-不，我只喝果汁就行了
-Joey? -No, no. l'll just have juice.

33
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,870
你干脆别去上班 跟我在一起就好了
Why don't you stay home from work and just hang out with me?

34
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,070
是啊，但愿如此
Oh,I wish.

35
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,080
你有报告要做 而我得去见律师
You have that report to finish,and I've got to see my lawyer.

36
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,970
我真不敢相信 我竟跟要离婚的女生约会
I can't believe I date a girl who's getting divorced.

37
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,010
我真像个大人
I'm such a grownup.

38
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,650
乔伊，嘿，回你的房间
Joey! Hey!Go to your room!

39
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,220
钱德，嘿，去你的
Chandler! Hey!Up yours!

40
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,650
我要走了…
I gotta go,I gotta go.

41
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,220
给我个吻才能走
Not without a kiss.

42
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,490
或者我就不亲你 这样你就会留下来
Maybe I won't kiss you so you'll stay.

43
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,130
快亲她…
Kiss her. Kiss her!

44
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,300
晚点见，甜心 再见，乔伊
I'll see you later,sweetie. Bye,Joey.

45
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,560
再见，珍妮丝
Bye-bye,Janice.

46
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,270
你什么时候要甩掉她？
When are you dumping her?

47
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,500
不会
Nope.

48
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,250
这次不会了
Not this time.

49
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,450
拜托，别整我了
Come on,quit yanking me.

50
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,580
我没有整你
I'm not yanking you.

51
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,180
这个是珍妮丝 对，我知道
-This is Janice. -Yeah,I know.

52
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,920
她让我很愉快
She makes me happy.

53
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,860
好，你看着我的眼睛 告诉我，不可以眨眼睛
You look me in the eye and tell me,without blinking...

54
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,830
说你不会跟她分手 别眨眼睛
...that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.

55
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,500
我不会跟她分手！
I'm not breaking up with her!

56
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,710
天啊，你看我在排水管里 发现什么？
God,look what I found in the drain!

57
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,210
什么？
What?

58
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,190
这些是理查的头发！
It's some of Richard's hair!

59
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,390
我该拿这些怎么办？
What do I do with this?

60
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,560
第一件事就是 把它从我身边拿开
Getting it away from me would be job one.

61
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,820
奇怪，但我并不想把它丢掉
It's weird,but I don't want to throw this away.

62
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,970
这些是我仅有的 属于他的东西
This is all I have left of him.

63
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,730
恶心的…
Gross...

64
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,700
排水管的头发
...drain hair.

65
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:46,140
真好玩，好像有一个小人 在你的麦片里淹死了
Cool! It looks like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal.

66
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:51,880
我是怎么了？ 你需要一些睡眠
-What is wrong with me? -You need to get some sleep.

67
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,150
我需要的是理查
I need to get some Richard.

68
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,190
你跟他分手是有原因的
You broke up with him for a reason.

69
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,390
我知道… 我只是不想再这么想他
I know. I know. I'm just so tired of missing him.

70
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,660
不愿再去想，他为何不打来？ 他为何都没打来？
Tired of wondering why he hasn't called. Why hasn't he?

71
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,930
可能因为你叫他别再打来？
Maybe because you told him not to?

72
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,870
你到底是什么？ 记忆女王吗？
What are you,the Memory Woman?

73
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,040
他们不会分手！ 我是说钱德和珍妮丝
They're not breaking up! Chandler and Janice?

74
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,710
他们不会分手！ 他的眼睛连眨一下都没有
They're not breaking up! He didn't blink!

75
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,710
我一点也不惊讶 你看过他们在一起的样子吗？
I'm not surprised. Have you seen them together?

76
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,080
他们真的好可爱
They're really cute.

77
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,350
“可爱？”那可是珍妮丝！
"Cute"? This is Janice!

78
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,720
你记得珍妮丝吗？
You remember Janice?

79
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,450
我记得啊，她很惹人厌 但是你知道吗？
Yes,I remember. She's annoying. But you know what?

80
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,260
她现在是他的女朋友 那我们能怎么办？
She's his girlfriend now. I mean,what can we do?

81
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:38,130
这就对了，我就是要这种精神 “我们能怎么办？”
There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! "What can we do?"

82
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,710
好，谁先来？罗斯？
All right,who's first,huh? Ross?

83
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,470
钱德是我们的朋友 而珍妮丝能让他快乐
Chandler's our friend,and Janice makes him happy.

84
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,440
所以我们就成熟点，接受她
So I say we be adult about it and accept her.

85
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,540
这个先归类在B计划
We'll call that Plan B.

86
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,210
拜托，我们需要些妙计
Come on, people!We need some inspiration.

87
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,750
好吧，你需要计划？这样
Okay, all right.You want a plan? Here we go:

88
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:02,860
那么，罗斯，你爬进排气管，不要触动警报，好吗
So, Ross, you go in through the air duct and disable the alarm, okay?

89
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,360
剩下的交给我们，放下绳子就行了
Then the rest of us will rappel down ropes.

90
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,890
我们要在十分钟之内进去出来，然后消失在夜色中，好吗？
We're in and out in 10 minutes and disappear into the night. Huh?

91
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,680
甜心…
Honey...

92
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,450
我在想啊…
... I was wondering...

93
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,520
你那套海军制服还在吗？
...do you still have that Navy uniform?

94
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:44,060
不，我拿去戏服店还了
No,I had to return it to the costume place.

95
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,090
我还有一套 高中乐团的旧制服
I think I have an old band uniform from high school.

96
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,930
你记得高中时不能做爱吧？ 是啊
You remember not having sex in high school,right?

97
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,440
甜心，那么你呢…
Well,honey,what about you?

98
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:04,870
你有任何有趣的幻想吗？
Do you have any fun,you know,fantasy-type things?

99
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,080
别这样，你一定有
Come on. You gotta have one.

100
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,120
没有
Nope.

101
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,780
罗斯，你知道吗？
You know what?

102
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,960
如果你跟我说 或许我会帮你实现
If you tell me,I might do it.

103
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,750
你有没有看过《星球大战》的《绝地大反攻》？
Did you ever see Return of the Jedi?

104
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,920
你记不记得那场戏…
Do you remember the scene...

105
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,090
当赫特族的贾霸出现时？
...with Jabba the Hutt?

106
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,130
他真是个胖胖的虫子怪物
He was this really fat worm guy.

107
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,270
哇哦，男人和女人的兴趣果然不一样
Wow. Men and women really are different.

108
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,400
不，不，不
No. No. No.

109
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,440
贾霸带着他的囚犯…
Well,Jabba had as his prisoner...

110
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,080
莉亚公主
... Princess Leia.

111
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:15,040
莉亚公主穿着…
Princess Leia was wearing...

112
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,760
金色的比基尼
...this gold bikini thing.

113
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,190
那样子很好看
It was pretty cool.

114
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:29,160
所以你是说你想让我…
So are you saying that you would like me...

115
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:33,800
打扮成莉亚公主，穿着金色的比基尼？
...to dress up like Princess Leia in a gold bikini?

116
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,840
好
Okay

117
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,950
莉亚公主穿金色比基尼？ 我们这年纪的男人都很喜欢
Princess Leia and the gold bikini? Every guy our age loved that.

118
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:44,850
真的吗？
Really?

119
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:49,660
很重要的！ 那个时刻，她不再是个公主
It's huge! That's the moment when she stopped being a princess...

120
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,660
她变成了…一个女人
...and she became,like,you know,a woman.

121
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,370
你曾扮过莉亚公主吗？
Did you ever do the Leia thing?

122
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,550
真的吗？有那么棒啊？
Really? That great,huh?

123
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:10,490
不，只是我买了新的传呼机 我把它调成“震动”
No,it's just that I got this new pager,and I have it on "vibrate."

124
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,280
再见
See you.

125
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,130
你们好啊
Hi,you guys!

126
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:21,390
你看我在四川龙餐厅外 找到谁了？
Look who I found standing outside the Szechuan Dragon...

127
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,900
她盯着停车收费表看
...staring at a parking meter.

128
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:31,730
你怎么没去上班？ 他们把我送回家了
-Why aren't you at work? -Oh,they sent me home.

129
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,200
为什么？
Why?

130
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:36,410
因为我并不是在四川龙餐厅上班
Because I don't work at the Szechuan Dragon.

131
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,810
你真的需要睡一下
You really need to get some sleep.

132
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,350
我知道
I know I do.

133
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,080
你猜怎么着？ 有人要出版我的论文
Guess what? They published my paper.

134
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,000
-真的吗？-是的
-Really?-Yes

135
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:52,010
藻类化石的碳定年法误差统计：历史还是神秘？
Statistical Deviations in the Carbon Dating of Fossilized Algae:History or Mystery?

136
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,720
瑞秋，你看！
Rach,look!

137
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:05,240
我那强壮的罗斯天行者 何时会来拯救我？
Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me?

138
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,410
他来了！
There he is!

139
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:17,980
-幸运！-的！
-Wheel! -Of!

140
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,340
轮盘！
Fortune!

141
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,350
这个家伙好笨
This guy's so stupid.

142
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,110
是“拉什莫尔伯爵” （应该是拉什莫尔山，刻有美国四位总统头像）
It's Count Rushmore!

143
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,330
你真的该去参加这个节目
You should really go on this show.

144
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:35,860
我有三张今晚巡游者队的票 你觉得如何？
I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What do you say?

145
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,970
我一定去！
I say I am there!

146
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,140
太棒了！
Cool!

147
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,960
罗斯也会去吗？
Is Ross going too?

148
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,440
不，是珍妮丝
No. Janice.

149
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:43,800
珍妮丝？
Janice?

150
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:49,180
因为我会替罗斯难过 你知道吗？
Because I just feel bad for Ross,you know?

151
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,980
我们总是一起去的 我们是曲棍球三兄弟啊
We always go together. We're like The Three Hockey-teers,you know?

152
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:58,990
我可能误会你了 但你是否不喜欢珍妮丝？
I may be way out on a limb here,but do you have a problem with Janice?

153
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,160
没有
No!

154
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:02,690
对啦…
Yes....

155
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,860
天啊，我该怎么说？
Oh,God,how do I say this?

156
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,960
你知道希腊餐厅里 那个头发很蓬的女孩子？
You know that girl from the restaurant with the hair?

157
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,970
那个我很讨厌的女孩子？ 她快把我逼疯了
That girl that I hate? She drives me crazy.

158
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:21,570
听着，我不讨厌珍妮丝 只是她令人难以忍受
Look,I don't hate Janice. She's just a lot to take,you know?

159
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,550
你说出来了吧
Well,there you go.

160
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,550
别那样看着我
Don't look at me like that.

161
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,090
以前她也快把你逼疯了 记得吗？
She drove you nuts before,remember?

162
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,490
但是我现在为她疯狂 这次可能是真的
I'm crazy about her now. This could be the real thing.

163
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,700
我是说“真的”
Capital R,capital T!

164
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,530
别担心，我说的字母是对的
Don't worry,those are the right letters.

165
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,500
你到底要我说什么？
Look,what do you want me to say?

166
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,760
我要你说你喜欢她！ 我不能
I want you to say that you like her! I can't

167
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,270
-喜欢她！-不！
-Like her!-No.

168
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,100
你甚至不想尝试？
So you're not even gonna try?

169
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:56,500
关键是什么，就像化学反应，知道吗
What's the point?lt's like this chemical thing, you know?

170
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:59,680
每次她一开始笑，我就想…
Every time she starts laughing,I just wanna...

171
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:05,550
想把我的手臂拔下来 然后往她身上砸
...pull my arm off so I have something to throw at her.

172
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:08,940
谢谢你的努力
Thanks for trying.

173
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,680
对了，根本就没有拉什莫尔伯爵！
Oh,and by the way,there is no Count Rushmore!

174
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:18,060
那个在拉什莫尔山上化妆假扮总统的人是谁？
Then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?

175
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,370
你怎么可以告诉她？
How could you tell her?

176
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:30,300
我想又没什么大不了的
I didn't think it would be that big a deal!

177
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,440
她认为没什么大不了的？
She didn't think it would be that big a deal!

178
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,880
你这样子是在跟谁讲话？
Who are you talking to when you do that?

179
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:40,450
这些应该是我们之间 很私密的对话
Look,that was supposed to be a private,personal thing between us.

180
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,950
菲比是我的女性好友，好吗？ 我们无话不谈的
Phoebe is my girlfriend,okay? We tell each other everything.

181
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,060
男人也一样啊
Guys do the same thing.

182
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,960
那些更衣室里的对话呢？
I mean,what about all that locker-room stuff?

183
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,600
那又不一样了，我们会谈 像是谁跟脱衣舞娘约会
That's different. That's like,who dated a stripper?

184
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,730
或谁在史坦顿岛渡轮的后舱做爱
Or who did it on the back of the Staten lsland ferry?

185
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,900
这两个都是乔伊吧
Both of those Joey?

186
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,470
但是不会谈女朋友…
But you don't talk about your girlfriend...

187
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,800
还有你们之间亲密的事
...and the intimate stuff you do with her.

188
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,810
连最好的朋友也不谈？
Not even with your best friend?

189
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:10,980
真可悲啊
That is so sad.

190
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,210
你们错过太多乐趣了
You're missing out on so much.

191
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,080
那是种互相连结 与分享的感觉…
I mean,the bonding and the sharing...

192
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:21,830
并知道他们也和你 经历过一样的事
...and knowing they're going through the same thing you are.

193
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:26,490
那你们什么都跟对方说吗？
So,what,you tell each other everything?

194
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,430
差不多啊
Pretty much.

195
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,970
你们有没有谈过 一夜五次的纪录？
Did you talk about the Night of Five Times?

196
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,110
你有没有告诉她们 那次一夜五次的纪录？
Do you tell people about the Night of Five Times?

197
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,470
甜心，你那次是跟卡萝
Honey,that was with Carol.

198
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,840
我知道，我想还是值得一提
I know,but it's still worth mentioning,I think.

199
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,780
全身肌肉放松
Relax every muscle in your body.

200
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:58,120
听着叮叮咚咚的音乐
Listen to the plinky-plunky music.

201
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,000
好，闭上你的眼睛
Okay,now close your eyes...

202
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:04,130
想一个很愉快的地方
...and think of a happy place.

203
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,000
告诉我让你快乐的地方是哪里
Tell me your happy place.

204
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,530
理查家的客厅，一起喝酒
Richard's living room,drinking wine.

205
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:14,940
不…不可以跟理查有关 把酒杯放下，快出来
No,no,no. Not a Richard thing. Just put down the glass and get out.

206
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,050
对不起，那是让我快乐的地方
I'm sorry,but that's my happy place.

207
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,150
好，我的快乐地方借你用 但别乱动东西
Okay,fine. Use my happy place. Just don't move anything in there.

208
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,650
我会试着不乱动
I'll try not to.

209
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,190
好，你现在在草地上…
Okay. All right,so,you're in a meadow...

210
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:32,790
天上有一片繁星
... millions of stars in the sky

211
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,020
你觉得分手是错误的吗？
You think breaking up was a mistake?

212
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,570
快乐的地方不准问问题
There are no questions in the happy place.

213
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:45,040
只有和煦的微风 和从树上撒下的月光
Just the warm breeze and the moonlight flowing through the trees.

214
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,810
我赌他一定忘了我 我打赌他好得很
I'll bet he's over me. I'll bet he's fine.

215
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:51,710
快乐的地方 不允许赌博和下注
Betting and wagering of any kind are not permitted in the happy place.

216
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,850
那里只有…美丽的瀑布
There's just,you know,the lovely waterfalls...

217
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,560
和缓慢流动着的喷泉
...and the trickling fountains...

218
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:04,090
还有低声轻语的小溪 产生平静的音律
...and the calming sounds of the babbling brook.

219
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,490
好，一点用也没有
Okay,this isn't working.

220
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,660
我还是醒着的 而且我得去尿尿
I'm still awake,and now I have to pee.

221
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:14,900
猜猜我是谁
Guess who!

222
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,650
珍妮丝，嗨，钱德刚走
Janice. Hi. You just missed Chandler...

223
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,820
但是，你走之前还是进来吧
but won't you come in before you go?

224
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,650
我听说…
So I hear...

225
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,060
你讨厌我！
...you hate me!

226
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,560
我没说我讨厌你 我可是很小心的
I never said hate. I was very careful about that.

227
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,170
有一只小鸟告诉我 你想扯下手臂，丢到我身上
A little birdie told me you wanted to rip your arm off and throw it at me.

228
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:52,450
这样你就觉得我讨厌你？ 你也太断章取义了吧
And you got "hate" from that? You're taking a big leap there.

229
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,910
好吧…
All right,fine,fine,fine!

230
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,880
这种情形，我们得想点策略
We have got to do something about our little situation here.

231
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,710
这是我的主意
So this is my idea.

232
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:04,860
你和我花点时间，好好相处
You and me spending some quality time together.

233
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,390
但是那有什么关…
But what does that

234
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,030
为了钱德！
For Chandler!

235
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,890
好吧，我加入
Okay. I'm in.

236
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:16,870
好！这就叫做… 乔伊和珍妮丝的逍遥一日游
Okay! This is what we'll call it: Joey and Janice's Day of Fun!

237
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,400
要一整天啊？
A whole day?

238
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:24,940
是的，因为这是让你爱上我需要的时间
Yes,because that's how long it takes to love me.

239
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:29,070
是，我知道 我睡在你们的隔壁
Yeah,I know. I sleep in the next room.

240
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,190
你们也都讨厌珍妮丝了？
So do you guys all hate Janice too?

241
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:41,260
你现在讨厌珍妮丝了？乔伊终于可以松一口气了
You hate Janice now? Joey's gonna be so relieved.

242
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,260
上帝啊
Oh, my God.

243
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,230
上帝啊
Oh, my God.

244
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:53,770
好吧，看，各位，这是在哭泣
Well, look, everybody. lt's Weepy:

245
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:57,240
哑剧：太过担心
The Mime that Cares Too Much.

246
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,280
我今天去了邮局
So I went down to the post office...

247
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:00,480
寄来的是我订的录影带
...and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered...
我今天去了邮局
So I went down to the post office...

248
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,180
寄来的是我订的录影带
...and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered...

249
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,850
是帮理查订的，有关南北战争的
...for Richard about the Civil War.

250
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,550
他很喜欢看南北战争
He loved the Civil War.

251
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,790
你要不要我们带你回家？
Do you want us to take you home?

252
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,460
或者带我到遥远的银河去吧（《星球大战》的开场台词）
Or maybe to a galaxy far,far away.

253
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,300
女人什么事都说，你知道吗？
Women tell each other everything! Did you know that?

254
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,920
不，钱德，我是说全部的事
No,Chandler,everything.

255
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,820
你喜欢的东西，她喜欢的东西
Like stuff you like. Stuff she likes.

256
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,820
技巧，精力，周长
Technique. Stamina. Girth.

257
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,720
“周长”？
Girth?

258
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,650
为什么…？
Why? Why? Why?

259
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,870
她们为何这样做？
Why would they do this?

260
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,370
瑞秋说分享的感觉很棒，而…
Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly...

261
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,510
我们也应该这么做
...we ought to be doing it.

262
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,870
你想要吗？
Do you want to?

263
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,510
我们不会要讨论周长吧？
We're not gonna talk about girth,are we?

264
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,080
好，你先吧
All right,you go first.

265
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,120
好，我先说
Okay. Okay,I'll go first.

266
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,420
有天晚上…
So the other night...

267
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:19,130
瑞秋和我在床上 讨论彼此的性幻想
...Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies...

268
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,630
我就形容了一个画面…
...and I happened to describe a particular...

269
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,300
星球大战里的…
... Star Wars thing

270
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,800
莉亚公主和金色比基尼
Princess Leia and the gold bikini.

271
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,060
我知道！
I know!

272
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,900
这倒挺容易的
Well,that was easy.

273
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,480
好，换你了
Okay,you go.

274
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,910
好，当你跟一个女人在床上…
Okay,you know when you're in bed with a woman...

275
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,650
正在亲热…
...fooling around...

276
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,090
脑袋里突然出现 一些疯狂的念头
...and you get all these mental images in your brain?

277
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:52,090
就像超级名模埃勒麦克弗森 或是影印店的那个女孩
Like Elle MacPherson or the girl at the Xerox place?

278
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,990
穿了肚脐环的那个？ 我知道
-With the bellybutton ring? -I know.

279
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:58,330
但是突然之间 你忽然想到你妈
And then all of a sudden,your mom pops into your head.

280
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,570
然后你就想 “妈，快走开啦！”
And you're,like,"Mom,get out of here!"

281
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:06,100
但从那时起 你的脑袋里就只有你妈
But after that,you can't think of anything else.

282
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:11,180
而你正在做的事又不能停止 所以你就好像…
And you can't stop what you're doing. So it's kind of like you're...

283
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:12,970
你知道的…
...you know...

284
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,310
你知道的…
...you know....

285
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,910
你不知道！
You don't know!

286
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,180
你妈妈？
Your mom?

287
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,650
你是说跟你妈一起？ 你究竟有什么毛病？
You're telling me about your mom? What's the matter with you?

288
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,600
你说… 我说要分享，不是吓人
-You said -I said "share," not "scare"!

289
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,520
你给我坐到那边去
Go sit over there!

290
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,600
我们回来了
We're back!

291
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,640
你们俩在一起干嘛？
What are you guys doing together?

292
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,370
乔伊和珍妮丝的逍遥一日游
Joey and Janice's Day of Fun!

293
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:47,980
真的吗？
Really?

294
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,520
我们去看纽约大都会的比赛 还吃了中国菜
We went to a Mets game. We got Chinese food.

295
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,980
你知道的，我爱这个女人
And,you know,I love this woman.

296
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,690
你有竞争对手了，兄弟
You have got competition,buddy.

297
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,000
我只是上来亲你一下
Well,I just came by to give you a kiss.

298
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:08,330
我得去接孩子了 待会儿见，甜心
I have to go pick up the baby. So,I'll see you later,sweetheart.

299
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:09,870
你也是，钱德
You too,Chandler.

300
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:23,240
你还是受不了她，是吗？ 抱歉，我已尽最大努力了！
-You still can't stand her,can you? -I'm sorry,I tried! I really did!

301
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,060
还是谢谢你的努力
I appreciate you giving it a shot.

302
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,490
但是有一点可喜的是…
But you know,the good thing...

303
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,200
我们整天在一起 而我还能存活
...is that we spent the whole day together and I survived.

304
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:37,520
更了不起的是，她也还活着
And what's even more amazing,so did she.

305
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,730
因为今天是谢伊球场（大都会主场）的“球棒”日
It was Bat Day at Shea Stadium.

306
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,160
我想这还蛮了不起的
I guess that's something.

307
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:45,170
天啊，这可是大事呢！
Oh,man,that's huge!

308
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,600
现在我知道 我可以待在她旁边，表示…
Now I know I can stand to be around her. Which means...

309
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,610
我可以和你们一起出去…
... I get to hang out with you.

310
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,580
反正这就是我的重点
Which is kind of the whole point anyway.

311
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:02,950
我们在咖啡店停了一下 结果遇到罗斯
Oh,hey! We stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.

312
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,360
天啊
Oh,God.

313
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,520
希望这会让你好过点 我也会有这种想法
If it makes you feel any better,I do it too.

314
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,400
真的吗？ 对啊
-Really? -Oh,yeah!

315
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,730
当我在做爱时 我都会想像你妈的样子
I always picture your mom when I'm having sex.

316
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,550
1861年4月12日
April 12,1861.

317
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,950
萨姆特堡的美国要塞遭到炮轰
The United States garrison at Fort Sumter was fired upon.

318
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,960
这场炮轰是由于…
It is now under bombardment by

319
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,830
爸，你怎么来了？
Dad! What are you doing?

320
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:55,670
你妈今晚打桥牌 所以我进城来，抱抱莫妮卡
It's your mother's bridge night,so l came into the city for a Moni-cuddle.

321
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,820
你什么时候开始抽雪茄了？
Since when did you start smoking cigars?

322
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:06,190
我没有，只是喜欢闻它的味道
I don't. I just like the smell of them.

323
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,320
你来这里真正的目的是什么？
So what are you really doing here?

324
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,690
我只想确定一下你还好吧
I just wanted to make sure you're okay.

325
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,090
我为什么会不好呢？
Why wouldn't I be okay?

326
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,660
我看到理查了
I saw Richard.

327
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:22,630
你还好吗？
So how you doing?

328
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,030
我很好
I'm fine.

329
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,200
我只是有点累，但我还好
I'm just a little tired,but I'm okay.

330
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,600
理查怎么样了？ 你不会想知道的
-How's Richard doing? -You don't want to know.

331
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,210
我真的很想知道
No,I really,really do.

332
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:36,280
他的情况很糟！
Well,he's doing terrible!

333
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,020
真的？
Really?

334
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,950
比他失去芭芭拉时还糟
Worse than when he broke up with Barbara.

335
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,960
你不是故意这么说的吧 不，那个男人简直一团糟
-You're not just saying that,are you? -No,the man is a mess!

336
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,460
他有没有哭？
Was he crying?

337
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,030
你觉得他是否等你走后 才一个人开始哭？
Do you think he was waiting till after you left,so he could cry?

338
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,470
或许吧
Maybe.

339
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,840
我想也是
I think so.

340
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,370
宝贝，感情这回事很难说 就像我跟你妈
Honey,relationships are hard. Like with your mom and me.

341
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:08,350
大学毕业后 我们曾分手一阵子
You know,after we graduated from college,we broke up for a while.

342
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,050
她父亲，就是你祖父，似乎…
It seems her father,your grandfather...

343
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,910
希望你妈跟他一样 到欧洲四处旅行…
...wanted her to travel around Europe like he did.

344
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:16,850
当然，他是为了山姆大叔（美国政府）…
Of course,he got to do it on Uncle Sam's nickel...

345
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:21,430
因为当时他也在猛轰德国的军用运输列车
... because he was also strafing German troop trains at the time.

346
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,430
然而…
However....

347
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,960
好吧，开始啰
Okay,here we go.

348
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,410
我是贾霸的囚犯，而你…
I am Jabba's prisoner. And you...

349
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,440
你脸上的表情好怪
... have a really weird look on your face.

350
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,280
怎么了，甜心？ 有什么问题？
What? Honey,what is it?

351
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,970
我的头发不对吗？
Did I get the hair wrong?

352
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,010
还是别的问题？ 跟你想像的不同，还是…？
Or what? Did you just picture it differently? What?

353
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:22,480
不是你的问题，是…
It's not you. It's....

354
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:31,520
怎么了？拜托，甜心 你快把我吓坏了
What is it? Come on,sweetie. You're,like,freaking me out here.

355
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,830
我恨钱德 那个混蛋毁了我的人生！
I hate Chandler. The bastard ruined my life!
