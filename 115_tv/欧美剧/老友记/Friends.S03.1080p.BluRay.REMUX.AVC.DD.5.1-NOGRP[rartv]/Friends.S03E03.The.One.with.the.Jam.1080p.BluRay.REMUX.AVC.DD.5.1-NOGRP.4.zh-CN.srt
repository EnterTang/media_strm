1
00:00:12,844 --> 00:00:16,764
See, Joe, that's why your parents
told you not to jump on the bed!

2
00:00:19,007 --> 00:00:23,666
The One With the Jam

4
00:01:05,124 --> 00:01:08,151
Hey, look at me!
I'm making jam!

5
00:01:08,413 --> 00:01:12,299
- I've been at it since 4 a. m.
- Where'd you get fruit at 4 a. m. ?

6
00:01:12,563 --> 00:01:15,339
Went down to the docks. Betcha
didn't know you can get it wholesale.

7
00:01:16,107 --> 00:01:17,762
I didn't know there were docks.

8
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:21,274
- Hey.
- Hey.

9
00:01:21,472 --> 00:01:22,713
Is it broken?

10
00:01:22,908 --> 00:01:25,238
No, but I gotta wear this
for a couple weeks.

11
00:01:25,527 --> 00:01:28,455
Did you tell the doctor you did it
jumping up and down on your bed?

12
00:01:29,231 --> 00:01:32,355
No. I had a whole story
worked out, but then...

13
00:01:32,647 --> 00:01:34,018
... Chandler sold me out.

14
00:01:34,212 --> 00:01:36,595
I'm sorry, Joe. I didn't think
the doctor was gonna buy...

15
00:01:36,798 --> 00:01:39,248
... that it just fell out of the socket.

16
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:42,637
What is this? Fruit?

17
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:46,946
Monica's making jam.

18
00:01:47,143 --> 00:01:51,672
Oh, jam? I love jam! Hey, how come
we never have jam at our place?

19
00:01:51,965 --> 00:01:53,968
Because the kids need new shoes.

20
00:01:55,254 --> 00:01:58,858
I'm going into business. I'm sick and
tired of being depressed about Richard.

21
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:01,665
I needed a plan.
A plan to get over my man.

22
00:02:01,927 --> 00:02:04,822
What's the opposite of man? Jam!

23
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,914
Oh, Joey, don't! It's way too hot!

24
00:02:15,657 --> 00:02:17,540
This'll just be my batch.

25
00:02:34,815 --> 00:02:35,740
That's it. No.

26
00:02:35,932 --> 00:02:37,391
Hey, you, J. Crew guy...

27
00:02:37,593 --> 00:02:39,345
Why have you been following me?

28
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,706
All week long,
everywhere I look, there's you.

29
00:02:42,191 --> 00:02:43,497
You wouldn't return my calls.

30
00:02:43,691 --> 00:02:45,281
- You sent back my letters.
- What?

31
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:47,678
One more chance, Ursula. Please.

32
00:02:51,163 --> 00:02:52,273
Oh, well, this is awkward.

33
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,736
Yeah, because you want Ursula,
and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters.

34
00:02:58,985 --> 00:03:00,476
Seriously.

35
00:03:01,955 --> 00:03:04,187
That's great.
I'm stalking the wrong woman.

36
00:03:04,381 --> 00:03:06,482
I am such a dingus!

37
00:03:07,032 --> 00:03:08,883
Oh, you're not a dingus.

38
00:03:09,107 --> 00:03:12,645
I just want you to know
I didn't used to be like this.

39
00:03:12,843 --> 00:03:15,173
Before I met your sister,
I was like this normal guy...

40
00:03:15,366 --> 00:03:17,118
... who sold beepers
and cellular phones.

41
00:03:19,005 --> 00:03:21,367
I mean, look,
it's not your fault, you know.

42
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,057
I mean, this is just what she
does to guys, okay? So just...

43
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,066
Well, thanks.

44
00:03:28,488 --> 00:03:30,785
Wait. You know what?
I got a little story.

45
00:03:31,553 --> 00:03:35,190
When I was in junior high, I went through
a period where I thought I was a witch.

46
00:03:35,385 --> 00:03:37,203
And there was this guidance
counselor who...

47
00:03:37,397 --> 00:03:39,596
... said something that
I think will help you a lot.

48
00:03:39,792 --> 00:03:44,005
He said, "Okay, you're not a witch.
You're just an average student. "

49
00:03:44,868 --> 00:03:47,546
- See what I'm saying?
- Not really.

50
00:03:48,732 --> 00:03:50,039
Well, get over it.

51
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:57,188
So... I mean, you just, you seem like
a really nice guy. You know, and just...

52
00:03:57,385 --> 00:03:59,355
Don't be so hard on yourself, okay?

53
00:03:59,588 --> 00:04:03,573
You're right. I know you're right.
And thanks for being so nice.

54
00:04:04,888 --> 00:04:05,814
Here.

55
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,787
Thanks a lot.

56
00:04:08,464 --> 00:04:09,890
Do you want to get a cup of coffee?

57
00:04:10,093 --> 00:04:12,260
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

58
00:04:14,595 --> 00:04:17,110
You don't have
to walk behind me anymore.

59
00:04:18,714 --> 00:04:21,359
- Mon?
- Mon?

60
00:04:22,577 --> 00:04:25,832
"Gone for more jars. Back later.
Monica Geller. "

61
00:04:27,335 --> 00:04:28,990
- Wait a minute. Look!
- What?

62
00:04:29,187 --> 00:04:30,744
- Look. Look. Look.
- What? What? What?

63
00:04:30,943 --> 00:04:33,043
It's an empty apartment.

64
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:36,170
We're all alone
in an empty apartment.

65
00:04:36,372 --> 00:04:39,747
Oh, honey, come on. I have
to be at work in, like, ten minutes.

66
00:04:40,554 --> 00:04:44,572
All right. Well, it's not like
I'm employee of the year or anything.

67
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,602
There it is!

68
00:04:50,803 --> 00:04:52,686
Oh, that's what you're talking about.

69
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:54,882
- Hey.
- Hey.

70
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:56,606
Do I look fat?

71
00:04:57,508 --> 00:04:58,586
- No.
- No.

72
00:04:58,786 --> 00:05:00,691
Okay. I accept that.

73
00:05:00,893 --> 00:05:03,604
When Janice asked me and I said no,
she took that to mean...

74
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:05,998
... that I was calling her a cow.

75
00:05:06,194 --> 00:05:09,448
Okay. Walk us through it, honey.
Walk us through it.

76
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:14,073
Okay, well, Janice said, "Hi. Do I look
fat today?" And I looked at her...

77
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:17,647
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. You looked at her?

78
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:21,514
You never look.

79
00:05:22,702 --> 00:05:26,621
You just answer. It's like a reflex.
"Do I look fat?" "No. "

80
00:05:29,023 --> 00:05:31,832
"Is she prettier than I am?"
"No. "

81
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:33,930
- Does size matter?
- No!

82
00:05:34,132 --> 00:05:35,787
And it works both ways.

83
00:05:38,826 --> 00:05:41,787
Okay, so you both
just know this stuff?

84
00:05:41,987 --> 00:05:45,176
You know, after about 30 or 40 fights,
you kind of catch on.

85
00:05:46,585 --> 00:05:48,011
Okay. For instance:

86
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:52,710
Let's say, Janice is coming back from
a trip and she gives you two options.

87
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:55,617
Option number one: She'll take
a cab home from the airport.

88
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:59,547
Or option two: You can meet her
at baggage claim. What do you do?

89
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,767
- That's easy. Baggage claim.
- Wrong! Now you're single.

90
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:08,133
It's actually secret
option number three.

91
00:06:08,552 --> 00:06:11,644
You meet her at the gate.
That way she knows you love her.

92
00:06:12,768 --> 00:06:13,748
Okay, this is good.

93
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:17,650
All right, listen. I have one.
Janice likes to cuddle...

94
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,206
... at night,
which I'm all for.

95
00:06:20,398 --> 00:06:23,839
But when you want to go to sleep,
you want some space.

96
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:26,750
So how do I tell her that without...

97
00:06:27,072 --> 00:06:30,033
... you know, accidentally
calling her fat or something?

98
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:34,638
Oh, honey. I'm sorry. We can't help you
there, because we're cuddly sleepers.

99
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,289
Okay. I'm late for work. All right.
Are you guys going to come down?

100
00:06:39,493 --> 00:06:42,421
- Yeah. I'm right behind you.
- Okay. Good luck, Chandler.

101
00:06:42,622 --> 00:06:43,797
- Thank you.
- Bye, sweetie.

102
00:06:43,995 --> 00:06:45,105
Bye, honey.

103
00:06:46,805 --> 00:06:49,189
Okay, the sleeping thing.

104
00:06:49,838 --> 00:06:52,287
Very tricky business,
but there is something you can do.

105
00:06:52,488 --> 00:06:55,678
- I thought you were "cuddly sleepers. "
- No.

106
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:59,917
No. Not cuddly.
Not me. Just her.

107
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,187
I'm like you.
I need the room.

108
00:07:02,514 --> 00:07:03,722
Okay, come here.

109
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:10,746
- Okay. You're in bed.
- Yeah.

110
00:07:14,073 --> 00:07:16,402
- I'm gonna use the cushion.
- Yeah.

111
00:07:17,776 --> 00:07:21,478
Okay. You're in bed.
She's over on your side, cuddling.

112
00:07:21,768 --> 00:07:24,631
Now, you wait for her to drift off...

113
00:07:25,121 --> 00:07:27,026
... and then you hug her...

114
00:07:27,675 --> 00:07:31,943
... and roll her over
to her side of the bed.

115
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,891
And then you...

116
00:07:35,274 --> 00:07:37,212
... roll away.

117
00:07:38,946 --> 00:07:40,600
Hug for her.

118
00:07:43,544 --> 00:07:45,579
Roll for you.

119
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,706
Okay. The old "hug and roll. "

120
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:50,913
- Okay. One question.
- Shoot.

121
00:07:51,111 --> 00:07:53,691
You're pretending
the pillow's a girl, right?

122
00:07:56,507 --> 00:08:00,394
Remember when you were a kid and your
mom would drop you off at the movies...

123
00:08:00,595 --> 00:08:03,654
... with a jar of jam
and a little spoon?

124
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,744
You're so pretty.

125
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,320
- Hi!
- Hey, Phoebe!

126
00:08:15,516 --> 00:08:19,185
Hey, you know that guy who's been
following me? I talked to him today.

127
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:20,969
You talked to him?

128
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,334
Are you crazy?

129
00:08:23,946 --> 00:08:27,516
Okay. First, I'm not crazy.
And second, say it, don't spray it.

130
00:08:28,831 --> 00:08:32,085
Anyway, his name is Malcolm,
and he wasn't following me.

131
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,989
I mean, he was, but just
because he thought I was Ursula.

132
00:08:37,356 --> 00:08:40,665
That's why he couldn't just
come up and talk to me.

133
00:08:41,475 --> 00:08:44,186
Because of the restraining order.

134
00:08:46,328 --> 00:08:48,234
Not feeling better about Malcolm.

135
00:08:49,936 --> 00:08:51,819
No, no, no. He's not a kook.

136
00:08:52,012 --> 00:08:55,681
He's just this, like, very passionate,
incredibly romantic guy...

137
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,520
... that just got, like, a teensy bit
carried away, you know.

138
00:08:58,717 --> 00:09:01,776
And we just get along really well,
and he is so cute.

139
00:09:02,804 --> 00:09:07,649
Oh, my God! You've got a crush
on your sister's stalker.

140
00:09:07,976 --> 00:09:10,752
I'm just going to help him.
You know. Get de-Ursula-ized.

141
00:09:10,946 --> 00:09:13,754
Like, you know. Like I did for Joey
after he went out with her.

142
00:09:13,948 --> 00:09:15,221
I didn't stalk her, I mean...

143
00:09:16,374 --> 00:09:19,684
- I asked for the news, not the weather.
- Sorry.

144
00:09:19,886 --> 00:09:22,695
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Mon.

145
00:09:23,016 --> 00:09:26,107
Joey, this is for you.
It's blackberry currant.

146
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,247
Joe, I got to ask.

147
00:09:34,479 --> 00:09:37,156
The girl from the Xerox place,
buck naked...

148
00:09:38,182 --> 00:09:40,217
... or a big tub of jam?

149
00:09:41,918 --> 00:09:43,670
Put your hands together.

150
00:09:47,665 --> 00:09:50,027
Joey, take your time with that.
That's my last batch.

151
00:09:50,763 --> 00:09:52,167
No more jam?

152
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,161
Well, what happened
to your jam plan?

153
00:09:55,393 --> 00:09:58,768
I figured out I'd need to charge
17 bucks a jar just to break even.

154
00:09:58,969 --> 00:10:02,093
So I've got a new plan now.
Babies.

155
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,608
Well, you're gonna
need much bigger jars.

156
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:11,125
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about me having a baby.

157
00:10:11,357 --> 00:10:13,524
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

158
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,008
The great thing about the jam plan
was I was taking control of my life.

159
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,640
So I asked myself, "What is the most
important thing to me in the world?"

160
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,876
And that's when I came up
with the baby plan.

161
00:10:23,076 --> 00:10:25,373
Aren't you forgetting something?

162
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,562
What is that guy's name?
Dad!

163
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:33,761
It took me 28 years to find one man
that I wanted to spend my life with.

164
00:10:33,995 --> 00:10:37,915
If I have to wait another 28 years,
then I'll be 56 before I can have a baby.

165
00:10:38,147 --> 00:10:39,931
And that's just stupid.

166
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,375
That's what's stupid?

167
00:10:44,884 --> 00:10:49,891
I don't need an actual man.
Just a couple of his best swimmers.

168
00:10:50,439 --> 00:10:53,728
And there are places that
you can go to get that stuff.

169
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,923
Down to the docks again?

170
00:11:05,255 --> 00:11:08,096
Night-night, Bing-a-ling.

171
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,960
Night-night...

172
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:12,943
... Janice.

173
00:11:16,558 --> 00:11:19,683
Look at all that room on her side!

174
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,697
You could fit a giant
penguin over there.

175
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:24,886
That'd be weird, though.

176
00:11:26,775 --> 00:11:27,983
Hug and roll time.

177
00:11:28,213 --> 00:11:30,412
I'm hugging. I'm hugging.

178
00:11:30,671 --> 00:11:32,870
You're rolling, and...

179
00:11:33,545 --> 00:11:35,003
Yes! Freedom!

180
00:11:35,748 --> 00:11:37,598
Except for this arm!

181
00:11:38,526 --> 00:11:41,106
I'm stuck. Stuck arm.

182
00:11:41,942 --> 00:11:45,317
Okay. Time for the old tablecloth
trick. One fluid motion.

183
00:11:45,518 --> 00:11:47,401
Quick like a cat. Quick like a cat.

184
00:11:47,594 --> 00:11:50,337
And one, two...

185
00:11:50,531 --> 00:11:52,251
... three!

186
00:11:58,546 --> 00:12:00,266
Here's my binoculars.

187
00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:05,118
Great. You're doing great, you know.
Real strong. Going strong. Keep going.

188
00:12:06,369 --> 00:12:08,470
These are my night-vision goggles.

189
00:12:09,307 --> 00:12:12,845
This is the book I pretend to read
when I'm watching her in the park.

190
00:12:13,745 --> 00:12:17,828
And these are Mad Libs.
They're just for fun.

191
00:12:18,024 --> 00:12:19,450
What's this?

192
00:12:19,652 --> 00:12:23,506
This is the log I kept,
recording her every movement.

193
00:12:23,707 --> 00:12:25,459
You want to hear something from it?

194
00:12:25,655 --> 00:12:27,440
Not even a little bit.

195
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,646
It's about you.

196
00:12:29,838 --> 00:12:31,525
Oh. Okay, then.

197
00:12:36,511 --> 00:12:38,198
"I met Phoebe today.

198
00:12:38,746 --> 00:12:42,480
She was really nice to me
even though I'm such a loser.

199
00:12:42,673 --> 00:12:45,765
And when I was walking home,
I thought about her a lot.

200
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:48,921
It was weird, but kind of cool. "

201
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:50,996
Good.

202
00:12:52,763 --> 00:12:54,254
So, what were you thinking?

203
00:12:55,413 --> 00:12:57,863
I was thinking what
it'd be like to kiss you.

204
00:12:58,095 --> 00:12:59,369
- Really?
- No.

205
00:13:02,534 --> 00:13:05,909
See, that's just something I said now
so that maybe I could kiss you.

206
00:13:06,461 --> 00:13:08,279
Oh, okay.

207
00:13:13,869 --> 00:13:16,862
No, it's all right.
I just had a jar of mustard.

208
00:13:17,987 --> 00:13:22,962
Okay. Sperm donor number 03815,
come on down!

209
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,707
Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds.

210
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:28,802
And he describes himself
as a male Geena Davis.

211
00:13:29,004 --> 00:13:31,333
You mean there's
more than one of us?

212
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,834
You can't do this, Mon.
All right. If you do this, I'm gonna...

213
00:13:36,028 --> 00:13:39,317
- You're gonna what?
- I'm gonna tell Mom.

214
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:43,079
Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right.
I love you, but you're crazy.

215
00:13:43,276 --> 00:13:45,759
Why? Why is this crazy?

216
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,600
- So this isn't the ideal way...
- Oh, it's not the ideal... ?

217
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:50,583
Lips moving. Still talking.

218
00:13:51,802 --> 00:13:53,707
It may not be ideal, but...

219
00:13:54,036 --> 00:13:55,691
... I'm so ready.

220
00:13:56,272 --> 00:13:58,307
I see the way
Ben looks at you.

221
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:01,339
It makes me ache, you know?

222
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,046
Check it out! Jam crackers!

223
00:14:07,606 --> 00:14:09,642
Okay. All right, how's this?

224
00:14:09,969 --> 00:14:12,582
Twenty-seven, Italian-American guy.

225
00:14:12,843 --> 00:14:14,334
He's an actor.

226
00:14:14,631 --> 00:14:16,188
Born in Queens.

227
00:14:16,483 --> 00:14:19,510
Wow! Big family.
Seven sisters...

228
00:14:20,474 --> 00:14:24,012
... and he's the only boy.

229
00:14:26,637 --> 00:14:30,142
Oh, my God! Under personal comments:
"New York Knicks rule. "

230
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,766
Yeah, the Knicks rule!

231
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:37,515
Joey, this is you!

232
00:14:37,717 --> 00:14:39,817
Let me see.

233
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:42,658
Oh, right.

234
00:14:43,911 --> 00:14:45,565
When did you go to a sperm bank?

235
00:14:45,762 --> 00:14:48,407
Oh, right after I did
that sex study down at NYU.

236
00:14:48,636 --> 00:14:51,118
Hey, remember that sweater
I gave you for your birthday?

237
00:14:51,318 --> 00:14:53,680
And that's how you bought it?

238
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:57,475
No. That's what I was wearing
when I donated.

239
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:03,952
I'm kind of surprised there's
any of my boys left.

240
00:15:04,155 --> 00:15:07,856
Honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean,
I've got an actual rocket scientist here.

241
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,085
Maybe I should call this place
and get them...

242
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:12,223
... to put my Days of our Lives
gig on here.

243
00:15:12,425 --> 00:15:14,079
Juice this puppy up a little.

244
00:15:15,968 --> 00:15:17,427
- Hey.
- Hey!

245
00:15:17,628 --> 00:15:18,836
How's the maniac?

246
00:15:19,321 --> 00:15:21,999
He's yummy.
We did a little kissing.

247
00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:24,964
- Phoebe, what are you doing?
- Oh, no.

248
00:15:25,164 --> 00:15:29,943
No. No. You know what? He's not into
that stuff anymore. He quit for me.

249
00:15:30,145 --> 00:15:35,120
This guy has been obsessed with your
sister for God knows how long, okay.

250
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:37,289
You don't just give up
something like that.

251
00:15:37,489 --> 00:15:40,962
So look, he gave me his night-vision
goggles and everything. So...

252
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,461
You're taking the word of a guy
who has night-vision goggles?

253
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:49,332
What? He's not still following her.
You think he's still following her?

254
00:15:49,527 --> 00:15:52,390
Pheebs. Wake up and smell
the restraining order.

255
00:15:54,252 --> 00:15:55,656
What are you saying I should do?

256
00:15:55,849 --> 00:15:58,744
I think that if you really like this
guy, you should just trust him.

257
00:15:58,946 --> 00:16:00,024
Thank you, Monica.

258
00:16:00,224 --> 00:16:02,585
Or you could follow him
and see where he goes.

259
00:16:02,778 --> 00:16:05,139
Oh, that's what I would do.
Forget mine.

260
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,191
Oh, my God! What happened?

261
00:16:09,387 --> 00:16:13,917
Oh, God. Crazy Chandler.
He spun me off the bed.

262
00:16:14,113 --> 00:16:16,824
Wow! Spinning.
That sounds like fun.

263
00:16:18,871 --> 00:16:20,242
I wish.

264
00:16:20,498 --> 00:16:24,929
No. You know, he was just
trying Ross' "hug and roll" thing.

265
00:16:27,363 --> 00:16:28,310
Ross' what?

266
00:16:28,513 --> 00:16:32,759
You know. Like where he hugs you
and then kind of rolls you away, and...

267
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:36,612
Oh...

268
00:16:36,815 --> 00:16:37,958
... my...

269
00:16:38,156 --> 00:16:40,224
... God!

270
00:17:10,564 --> 00:17:12,763
- Phoebe?
- Yes? Yes!

271
00:17:14,587 --> 00:17:15,534
What are you doing?

272
00:17:15,738 --> 00:17:18,829
Oh, I was just here
looking for my...

273
00:17:19,218 --> 00:17:21,668
Part of an old sandwich.
Here it is!

274
00:17:23,432 --> 00:17:25,500
Were you following me?

275
00:17:26,466 --> 00:17:27,478
Perhaps.

276
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:30,864
Yes. Yes. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

277
00:17:31,127 --> 00:17:34,055
I was just afraid that you
were still hung up on my sister.

278
00:17:34,256 --> 00:17:36,585
So you spied on me.

279
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:38,978
I can't believe
you don't trust me.

280
00:17:44,442 --> 00:17:48,710
Oh, well, what do you know?
There goes my identical twin sister!

281
00:17:49,008 --> 00:17:51,458
Just walking along, looking like me.

282
00:17:52,807 --> 00:17:56,574
Well, is this like a freakish coincidence,
or did you know that she takes this train?

283
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:01,715
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I tried to stop, but I couldn't.

284
00:18:02,323 --> 00:18:04,043
I'm so pathetic.

285
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:08,006
No. No, it's not your fault.
You know, it's partly my fault.

286
00:18:08,198 --> 00:18:10,648
It's 'cause I made
you quit cold turkey.

287
00:18:12,189 --> 00:18:15,662
Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you
anymore because you're, you know...

288
00:18:15,925 --> 00:18:17,035
Wow!

289
00:18:18,926 --> 00:18:22,976
But I will definitely, definitely
help you get over my sister. Okay?

290
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,044
Stalk me for a while, huh?

291
00:18:26,877 --> 00:18:30,099
Yeah, and I'll be like an Ursula patch.

292
00:18:31,507 --> 00:18:32,998
- I don't know.
- Yeah! Just...

293
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:35,202
Okay. Look, I'm going!

294
00:18:35,721 --> 00:18:37,408
Come on.

295
00:18:37,828 --> 00:18:41,138
I'm behind the pillar.
Which way am I gonna go?

296
00:18:42,906 --> 00:18:43,984
- Hey.
- Hey.

297
00:18:44,183 --> 00:18:46,414
- Where you going?
- To the bank.

298
00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:48,841
Sperm or regular?

299
00:18:49,707 --> 00:18:51,078
Sperm.

300
00:18:51,303 --> 00:18:56,028
- So you're really doing it, huh?
- Oh, yeah. I picked a guy. 37135.

301
00:18:56,221 --> 00:18:57,331
Sounds nice.

302
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:00,339
I'd say so. He's got
brown hair and green eyes.

303
00:19:00,531 --> 00:19:02,022
No kidding?

304
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:05,090
- What?
- I figured you would have picked a blond.

305
00:19:05,672 --> 00:19:07,609
- Really? Why?
- I don't know.

306
00:19:07,811 --> 00:19:12,406
I always pictured you ending up with a
tall, smart, blond guy with a name like...

307
00:19:12,632 --> 00:19:13,579
... Hoyt.

308
00:19:14,963 --> 00:19:15,889
Hoyt?

309
00:19:16,081 --> 00:19:17,322
It's a name. Yeah.

310
00:19:18,475 --> 00:19:22,841
I saw you in this, you know,
this great house with a big pool.

311
00:19:23,073 --> 00:19:25,588
Yeah? Is he a swimmer?

312
00:19:26,234 --> 00:19:27,540
He's got the body for it.

313
00:19:28,629 --> 00:19:30,697
I like that.

314
00:19:33,004 --> 00:19:34,277
What?

315
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:35,996
You have one of those signs that says:

316
00:19:36,197 --> 00:19:39,190
"We don't swim in your toilet,
so don't pee in our pool. " You know.

317
00:19:39,389 --> 00:19:42,611
- We do not have one of those signs.
- Sure, you do. It was a gift from me.

318
00:19:44,307 --> 00:19:46,887
Oh! And you have these three great kids.

319
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:50,209
- Two girls and a boy?
- Yeah!

320
00:19:50,406 --> 00:19:52,605
And they wear those little water wings,
you know...

321
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,683
... and they're running around
on the deck.

322
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,553
And then Hoyt wraps this big towel
around all three of them.

323
00:19:57,749 --> 00:19:59,436
Sure.

324
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:07,609
But, hey, you know,
this way sounds good too.

325
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,507
Yeah.

326
00:20:13,938 --> 00:20:15,527
Oh, Monica.

327
00:20:22,495 --> 00:20:24,628
Wow! This guy's an astronaut?

328
00:20:26,263 --> 00:20:28,713
That would have been cool...

329
00:20:28,913 --> 00:20:30,731
... for like a day.

330
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:39,071
I called the sperm bank today.

331
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:42,322
They haven't sold a single unit
of Tribbiani.

332
00:20:42,807 --> 00:20:44,298
Nobody wants my product.

333
00:20:46,256 --> 00:20:48,227
I mean, I don't get it, you know.

334
00:20:52,323 --> 00:20:53,466
I mean...

335
00:20:54,366 --> 00:20:56,151
Maybe if they met me in person.

336
00:20:57,878 --> 00:21:00,426
Honey, you got a little thing on your...

337
00:21:04,009 --> 00:21:04,935
Get it?

338
00:21:06,085 --> 00:21:07,674
Yeah.

339
00:21:09,406 --> 00:21:11,158
Hello.

340
00:21:12,215 --> 00:21:14,000
Hello.

341
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:18,661
Okay.

342
00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:23,610
Chan, can I talk to you
for a second?

343
00:21:23,806 --> 00:21:25,743
Sure. What's up?

344
00:21:25,945 --> 00:21:28,841
Just one additional
relationship thought.

345
00:21:29,042 --> 00:21:31,687
Something you're probably
already familiar with.

346
00:21:31,884 --> 00:21:32,929
Women talk.
