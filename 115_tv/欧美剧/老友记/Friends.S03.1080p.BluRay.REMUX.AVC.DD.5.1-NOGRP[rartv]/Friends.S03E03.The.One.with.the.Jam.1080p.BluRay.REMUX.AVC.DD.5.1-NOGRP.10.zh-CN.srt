1
00:00:16,718 --> 00:00:20,882
See, Joe, that's why your parents
told you not to jump on the bed!

2
00:00:23,258 --> 00:00:24,384
The One With the Jam

3
00:01:10,305 --> 00:01:13,502
Hey, look at me!
I'm making jam!

4
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:17,837
- I've been at it since 4 a.m.
- Where'd you get fruit at 4 a.m?

5
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,014
Went down to the docks. Betcha
didn't know you can get it wholesale.

6
00:01:21,783 --> 00:01:23,546
I didn't know there were docks.

7
00:01:25,987 --> 00:01:27,249
- Hey.
- Hey.

8
00:01:27,422 --> 00:01:28,753
Is it broken?

9
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:31,391
No, but I gotta wear this
for a couple weeks.

10
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:34,753
Did you tell the doctor you did it
jumping up and down on your bed?

11
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,829
No. I had a whole story
worked out, but then...

12
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,533
...Chandler sold me out.

13
00:01:40,702 --> 00:01:43,227
I'm sorry, Joe. I didn't think
the doctor was gonna buy...

14
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:45,998
...that it just fell out of the socket.

15
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:49,540
What is this? Fruit?

16
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,042
Monica's making jam.

17
00:01:54,215 --> 00:01:59,016
Oh, jam? I love jam! Hey, how come
we never have jam at our place?

18
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:01,414
Because the kids need new shoes.

19
00:02:02,724 --> 00:02:06,524
I'm going into business. I'm sick and
tired of being depressed about Richard.

20
00:02:06,728 --> 00:02:09,458
I needed a plan.
A plan to get over my man.

21
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:12,757
What's the opposite of man? Jam!

22
00:02:14,736 --> 00:02:17,000
Oh, Joey, don't! It's way too hot!

23
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:26,002
This'll just be my batch.

24
00:02:44,065 --> 00:02:45,054
That's it. No.

25
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:46,791
Hey, you, J. Crew guy...

26
00:02:46,968 --> 00:02:48,799
Why have you been following me?

27
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,268
All week long,
everywhere I look, there's you.

28
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:53,138
You wouldn't return my calls.

29
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:55,002
- You sent back my letters.
- What?

30
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:57,508
One more chance, Ursula. Please.

31
00:03:01,115 --> 00:03:02,309
Oh, well, this is awkward.

32
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:08,052
Yeah, because you want Ursula,
and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters.

33
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:10,915
Seriously.

34
00:03:12,427 --> 00:03:14,793
That's great.
I'm stalking the wrong woman.

35
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:17,192
I am such a dingus!

36
00:03:17,732 --> 00:03:19,700
Oh, you're not a dingus.

37
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:23,598
I just want you to know
I didn't used to be like this.

38
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:26,239
Before I met your sister,
I was like this normal guy...

39
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:28,272
...who sold beepers and cellular phones.

40
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:32,702
I mean, look,
it's not your fault, you know.

41
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,647
I mean, this is just what she
does to guys, okay? So just...

42
00:03:38,553 --> 00:03:39,747
Well, thanks.

43
00:03:40,154 --> 00:03:42,588
Wait. You know what?
I got a little story.

44
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:47,191
When I was in junior high, I went through
a period where I thought I was a witch.

45
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:49,295
And there was this guidance
counselor who...

46
00:03:49,464 --> 00:03:51,796
...said something that
I think will help you a lot.

47
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:56,369
He said, "Okay, you're not a witch.
You're just an average student."

48
00:03:57,238 --> 00:04:00,071
- See what I'm saying?
- Not really.

49
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:02,674
Well, get over it.

50
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:10,146
So... I mean, you just, you seem like
a really nice guy. You know, and just...

51
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:12,445
Don't be so hard on yourself, okay?

52
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:16,851
You're right. I know you're right.
And thanks for being so nice.

53
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:19,181
Here.

54
00:04:19,594 --> 00:04:21,255
Thanks a lot.

55
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,453
Do you want to get a cup of coffee?

56
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:25,929
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

57
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:30,964
You don't have
to walk behind me anymore.

58
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:35,405
- Mon?
- Mon?

59
00:04:36,644 --> 00:04:40,080
"Gone for more jars. Back later.
Monica Geller."

60
00:04:41,616 --> 00:04:43,379
- Wait a minute. Look!
- What?

61
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:45,246
- Look. Look. Look.
- What? What? What?

62
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,649
It's an empty apartment.

63
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:50,915
We're all alone
in an empty apartment.

64
00:04:51,092 --> 00:04:54,653
Oh, honey, come on. I have
to be at work in, like, ten minutes.

65
00:04:55,463 --> 00:04:59,695
All right. Well, it's not like
I'm employee of the year or anything.

66
00:05:04,906 --> 00:05:05,964
There it is!

67
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,131
Oh, that's what you're talking about.

68
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:10,436
- Hey.
- Hey.

69
00:05:11,112 --> 00:05:12,238
Do I look fat?

70
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:14,307
- No.
- No.

71
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:16,507
Okay. I accept that.

72
00:05:16,684 --> 00:05:19,585
When Janice asked me and I said no,
she took that to mean...

73
00:05:19,754 --> 00:05:22,086
...that I was calling her a cow.

74
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:25,692
Okay. Walk us through it, honey.
Walk us through it.

75
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:30,524
Okay, well, Janice said, "Hi. Do I look
fat today?" And I looked at her...

76
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:34,259
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. You looked at her?

77
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,266
You never look.

78
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:43,603
You just answer. It's like a reflex.
"Do I look fat?" "No."

79
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,049
"Is she prettier than I am?"
"No."

80
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:51,276
- Does size matter?
- No!

81
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:53,215
And it works both ways.

82
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:59,485
Okay, so you both
just know this stuff?

83
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,027
You know, after about 30 or 40 fights,
you kind of catch on.

84
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:05,989
Okay. For instance:

85
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:10,866
Let's say, Janice is coming back from
a trip and she gives you two options.

86
00:06:11,072 --> 00:06:13,905
Option number one: She'll take
a cab home from the airport.

87
00:06:14,075 --> 00:06:18,011
Or option two: You can meet her
at baggage claim. What do you do?

88
00:06:18,179 --> 00:06:21,376
- That's easy. Baggage claim.
- Wrong! Now you're single.

89
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:27,017
It's actually secret
option number three.

90
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:30,686
You meet her at the gate.
That way she knows you love her.

91
00:06:31,826 --> 00:06:32,884
Okay, this is good.

92
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,962
All right, listen. I have one.
Janice likes to cuddle...

93
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:39,622
...at night,
which I'm all for.

94
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,395
But when you want to go to sleep,
you want some space.

95
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:46,438
So how do I tell her that without...

96
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:49,869
...you know, accidentally
calling her fat or something?

97
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:54,681
Oh, honey. I'm sorry. We can't help you
there, because we're cuddly sleepers.

98
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,577
Okay. I'm late for work. All right.
Are you guys going to come down?

99
00:06:59,754 --> 00:07:02,848
- Yeah. I'm right behind you.
- Okay. Good luck, Chandler.

100
00:07:03,024 --> 00:07:04,286
- Thank you.
- Bye, sweetie.

101
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,652
Bye, honey.

102
00:07:07,395 --> 00:07:09,920
Okay, the sleeping thing.

103
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:13,158
Very tricky business,
but there is something you can do.

104
00:07:13,334 --> 00:07:16,667
- I thought you were "cuddly sleepers."
- No.

105
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:21,099
No. Not cuddly.
Not me. Just her.

106
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:23,470
I'm like you.
I need the room.

107
00:07:23,778 --> 00:07:25,075
Okay, come here.

108
00:07:28,683 --> 00:07:32,449
- Okay. You're in bed.
- Yeah.

109
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,358
- I'm gonna use the cushion.
- Yeah.

110
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,662
Okay. You're in bed.
She's over on your side, cuddling.

111
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:46,957
Now, you wait for her to drift off...

112
00:07:47,435 --> 00:07:49,426
...and then you hug her...

113
00:07:50,071 --> 00:07:54,565
...and roll her over
to her side of the bed.

114
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:56,601
And then you...

115
00:07:58,012 --> 00:08:00,071
...roll away.

116
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:03,612
Hug for her.

117
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:08,848
Roll for you.

118
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:12,116
Okay. The old "hug and roll."

119
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:14,422
- Okay. One question.
- Shoot.

120
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:17,325
You're pretending
the pillow's a girl, right?

121
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:24,295
Remember when you were a kid and your
mom would drop you off at the movies...

122
00:08:24,472 --> 00:08:27,703
...with a jar of jam
and a little spoon?

123
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:31,977
You're so pretty.

124
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,882
- Hi!
- Hey, Phoebe!

125
00:08:39,053 --> 00:08:42,921
Hey, you know that guy who's been
following me? I talked to him today.

126
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,785
You talked to him?

127
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,257
Are you crazy?

128
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:51,628
Okay. First, I'm not crazy.
And second, say it, don't spray it.

129
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:56,368
Anyway, his name is Malcolm,
and he wasn't following me.

130
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,403
I mean, he was, but just
because he thought I was Ursula.

131
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:05,334
That's why he couldn't just
come up and talk to me.

132
00:09:06,147 --> 00:09:09,014
Because of the restraining order.

133
00:09:11,252 --> 00:09:13,277
Not feeling better about Malcolm.

134
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:17,013
No, no, no. He's not a kook.

135
00:09:17,191 --> 00:09:21,059
He's just this, like, very passionate,
incredibly romantic guy...

136
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:24,026
...that just got, like, a teensy bit
carried away, you know.

137
00:09:24,198 --> 00:09:27,429
And we just get along really well,
and he is so cute.

138
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:33,532
Oh, my God! You've got a crush
on your sister's stalker.

139
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:36,776
I'm just going to help him.
You know. Get de-Ursula-ized.

140
00:09:36,944 --> 00:09:39,913
Like, you know. Like I did for Joey
after he went out with her.

141
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,445
I didn't stalk her, I mean...

142
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:46,143
- I asked for the news, not the weather.
- Sorry.

143
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,289
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Mon.

144
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,855
Joey, this is for you.
It's blackberry currant.

145
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,327
Joe, I got to ask.

146
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:04,368
The girl from the Xerox place,
buck naked...

147
00:10:05,406 --> 00:10:07,567
...or a big tub of jam?

148
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,175
Put your hands together.

149
00:10:15,316 --> 00:10:17,841
Joey, take your time with that.
That's my last batch.

150
00:10:18,586 --> 00:10:20,076
No more jam?

151
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,216
Well, what happened
to your jam plan?

152
00:10:23,424 --> 00:10:26,985
I figured out I'd need to charge
17 bucks a jar just to break even.

153
00:10:27,161 --> 00:10:30,460
So I've got a new plan now.
Babies.

154
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:34,133
Well, you're gonna
need much bigger jars.

155
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:39,864
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about me having a baby.

156
00:10:40,074 --> 00:10:42,372
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

157
00:10:42,543 --> 00:10:46,001
The great thing about the jam plan
was I was taking control of my life.

158
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:49,809
So I asked myself, "What is the most
important thing to me in the world?"

159
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:52,179
And that's when I came up
with the baby plan.

160
00:10:52,353 --> 00:10:54,787
Aren't you forgetting something?

161
00:10:55,356 --> 00:10:58,120
What is that guy's name?
Dad!

162
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:03,554
It took me 28 years to find one man
that I wanted to spend my life with.

163
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:07,860
If I have to wait another 28 years,
then I'll be 56 before I can have a baby.

164
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:09,968
And that's just stupid.

165
00:11:11,372 --> 00:11:13,567
That's what's stupid?

166
00:11:15,109 --> 00:11:20,376
I don't need an actual man.
Just a couple of his best swimmers.

167
00:11:20,915 --> 00:11:24,407
And there are places that
you can go to get that stuff.

168
00:11:24,585 --> 00:11:26,712
Down to the docks again?

169
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:39,422
Night-night, Bing-a-ling.

170
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:42,392
Night-night...

171
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,464
...Janice.

172
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,507
Look at all that room on her side!

173
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,613
You could fit a giant penguin over there.

174
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:56,946
That'd be weird, though.

175
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,216
Hug and roll time.

176
00:12:00,421 --> 00:12:02,753
I'm hugging. I'm hugging.

177
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,322
You're rolling, and...

178
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:07,551
Yes! Freedom!

179
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:10,263
Except for this arm!

180
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:13,928
I'm stuck. Stuck arm.

181
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:18,295
Okay. Time for the old tablecloth trick.
One fluid motion.

182
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:20,463
Quick like a cat. Quick like a cat.

183
00:12:20,641 --> 00:12:23,542
And one, two...

184
00:12:23,711 --> 00:12:25,542
...three!

185
00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:35,518
Here's my binoculars.

186
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:40,589
Great. You're doing great, you know.
Real strong. Going strong. Keep going.

187
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:44,092
These are my night-vision goggles.

188
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:48,629
This is the book I pretend to read
when I'm watching her in the park.

189
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:53,836
And these are Mad Libs.
They're just for fun.

190
00:12:54,008 --> 00:12:55,532
What's this?

191
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:59,770
This is the log I kept,
recording her every movement.

192
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:01,812
You want to hear something from it?

193
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:03,882
Not even a little bit.

194
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:06,208
It's about you.

195
00:13:06,387 --> 00:13:08,184
Oh. Okay, then.

196
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,157
"I met Phoebe today.

197
00:13:15,696 --> 00:13:19,632
She was really nice to me
even though I'm such a loser.

198
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,031
And when I was walking home,
I thought about her a lot.

199
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:26,329
It was weird, but kind of cool."

200
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:28,498
Good.

201
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,902
So, what were you thinking?

202
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,674
I was thinking what
it'd be like to kiss you.

203
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:37,248
- Really?
- No.

204
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:44,115
See, that's just something I said now
so that maybe I could kiss you.

205
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:46,592
Oh, okay.

206
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,527
No, it's all right.
I just had a jar of mustard.

207
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:01,903
Okay. Sperm donor number 03815,
come on down!

208
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:04,771
Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds.

209
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:08,005
And he describes himself
as a male Geena Davis.

210
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:10,650
You mean there's
more than one of us?

211
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:15,388
You can't do this, Mon.
All right. If you do this, I'm gonna...

212
00:14:15,556 --> 00:14:19,014
- You're gonna what?
- I'm gonna tell Mom.

213
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:22,959
Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right.
I love you, but you're crazy.

214
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,758
Why? Why is this crazy?

215
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:28,693
- So this isn't the ideal way...
- Oh, it's not the ideal...?

216
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:30,765
Lips moving. Still talking.

217
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:34,030
It may not be ideal, but...

218
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:36,104
...I'm so ready.

219
00:14:36,677 --> 00:14:38,838
I see the way
Ben looks at you.

220
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:42,006
It makes me ache, you know?

221
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:45,913
Check it out! Jam crackers!

222
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,716
Okay. All right, how's this?

223
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:53,788
Twenty-seven, Italian-American guy.

224
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:55,619
He's an actor.

225
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,557
Born in Queens.

226
00:14:57,831 --> 00:15:01,028
Wow! Big family.
Seven sisters...

227
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:05,700
...and he's the only boy.

228
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:12,105
Oh, my God! Under personal comments:
"New York Knicks rule."

229
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,803
Yeah, the Knicks rule!

230
00:15:17,818 --> 00:15:19,843
Joey, this is you!

231
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,250
Let me see.

232
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:25,218
Oh, right.

233
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:28,256
When did you go to a sperm bank?

234
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:31,226
Oh, right after I did
that sex study down at NYU.

235
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,059
Hey, remember that sweater
I gave you for your birthday?

236
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:36,702
And that's how you bought it?

237
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:40,668
No. That's what I was wearing
when I donated.

238
00:15:43,911 --> 00:15:47,438
I'm kind of surprised there's
any of my boys left.

239
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:51,550
Honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean,
I've got an actual rocket scientist here.

240
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:53,879
Maybe I should call this place
and get them...

241
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:56,113
...to put my Days of our Lives
gig on here.

242
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,053
Juice this puppy up a little.

243
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:01,551
- Hey.
- Hey!

244
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:03,025
How's the maniac?

245
00:16:03,497 --> 00:16:06,330
He's yummy.
We did a little kissing.

246
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:09,394
- Phoebe, what are you doing?
- Oh, no.

247
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:14,598
No. No. You know what? He's not
into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.

248
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:20,008
This guy has been obsessed with your
sister for God knows how long, okay.

249
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,273
You don't just give up
something like that.

250
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:26,146
So look, he gave me his night-vision
goggles and everything. So...

251
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,847
You're taking the word of a guy
who has night-vision goggles?

252
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:34,892
What? He's not still following her.
You think he's still following her?

253
00:16:35,062 --> 00:16:38,088
Pheebs. Wake up and smell
the restraining order.

254
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,467
What are you saying I should do?

255
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:44,695
I think that if you really like this guy,
you should just trust him.

256
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:46,031
Thank you, Monica.

257
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:48,697
Or you could follow him
and see where he goes.

258
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,366
Oh, that's what I would do.
Forget mine.

259
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:55,612
Oh, my God! What happened?

260
00:16:55,782 --> 00:17:00,583
Oh, God. Crazy Chandler.
He spun me off the bed.

261
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:03,621
Wow! Spinning.
That sounds like fun.

262
00:17:05,726 --> 00:17:07,193
I wish.

263
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:12,091
No. You know, he was just
trying Ross' "hug and roll" thing.

264
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:15,590
Ross' what?

265
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:20,229
You know. Like where he hugs you
and then kind of rolls you away, and...

266
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:24,267
Oh...

267
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:25,672
...my...

268
00:17:25,846 --> 00:17:28,041
...God!

269
00:17:59,713 --> 00:18:02,045
- Phoebe?
- Yes? Yes!

270
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:04,975
What are you doing?

271
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:08,417
Oh, I was just here
looking for my...

272
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:11,383
Part of an old sandwich.
Here it is!

273
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:15,388
Were you following me?

274
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:17,455
Perhaps.

275
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:20,993
Yes. Yes. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

276
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:24,294
I was just afraid that you
were still hung up on my sister.

277
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:26,939
So you spied on me.

278
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:29,439
I can't believe
you don't trust me.

279
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:39,643
Oh, well, what do you know?
There goes my identical twin sister!

280
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,514
Just walking along, looking like me.

281
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:47,849
Well, is this like a freakish coincidence,
or did you know that she takes this train?

282
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:53,221
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I tried to stop, but I couldn't.

283
00:18:53,834 --> 00:18:55,631
I'm so pathetic.

284
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:59,761
No. No, it's not your fault.
You know, it's partly my fault.

285
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,534
It's 'cause I made you quit cold turkey.

286
00:19:04,111 --> 00:19:07,774
Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you
anymore because you're, you know...

287
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:09,208
Wow!

288
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:15,451
But I will definitely, definitely
help you get over my sister. Okay?

289
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:18,656
Stalk me for a while, huh?

290
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:22,894
Yeah, and I'll be like an Ursula patch.

291
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:25,923
- I don't know.
- Yeah! Just...

292
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:28,226
Okay. Look, I'm going!

293
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:30,499
Come on.

294
00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:34,396
I'm behind the pillar.
Which way am I gonna go?

295
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:37,369
- Hey.
- Hey.

296
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:39,910
- Where you going?
- To the bank.

297
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,446
Sperm or regular?

298
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:44,806
Sperm.

299
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:49,978
- So you're really doing it, huh?
- Oh, yeah. I picked a guy. 37135.

300
00:19:50,157 --> 00:19:51,351
Sounds nice.

301
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:54,494
I'd say so. He's got
brown hair and green eyes.

302
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:56,253
No kidding?

303
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:59,459
- What?
- I figured you would have picked a blond.

304
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:02,058
- Really? Why?
- I don't know.

305
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:07,070
I always pictured you ending up with a tall,
smart, blond guy with a name like...

306
00:20:07,274 --> 00:20:08,298
...Hoyt.

307
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:10,698
Hoyt?

308
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,208
It's a name. Yeah.

309
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:17,976
I saw you in this, you know,
this great house with a big pool.

310
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:20,880
Yeah? Is he a swimmer?

311
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:22,920
He's got the body for it.

312
00:20:24,024 --> 00:20:26,219
I like that.

313
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:29,960
What?

314
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,757
You have one of those signs that says:

315
00:20:31,932 --> 00:20:35,095
"We don't swim in your toilet,
so don't pee in our pool." You know.

316
00:20:35,268 --> 00:20:38,635
- We do not have one of those signs.
- Sure, you do. It was a gift from me.

317
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:43,103
Oh! And you have these three great kids.

318
00:20:43,276 --> 00:20:46,575
- Two girls and a boy?
- Yeah!

319
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,078
And they wear those little water wings,
you know...

320
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:51,240
...and they're running around
on the deck.

321
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:54,284
And then Hoyt wraps this big towel
around all three of them.

322
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:56,251
Sure.

323
00:21:02,062 --> 00:21:04,792
But, hey, you know,
this way sounds good too.

324
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:08,831
Yeah.

325
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:13,033
Oh, Monica.

326
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,544
Wow! This guy's an astronaut?

327
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:26,845
That would have been cool...

328
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,954
...for like a day.

329
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:39,955
She'll be back at 5.

330
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:41,930
Five!

331
00:21:48,675 --> 00:21:50,165
I called the sperm bank today.

332
00:21:50,377 --> 00:21:53,574
They haven't sold a single unit
of Tribbiani.

333
00:21:54,047 --> 00:21:55,639
Nobody wants my product.

334
00:21:57,651 --> 00:21:59,778
I mean, I don't get it, you know.

335
00:22:04,024 --> 00:22:05,252
I mean...

336
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,059
Maybe if they met me in person.

337
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:12,525
Honey, you got a little thing on your...

338
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:17,191
Get it?

339
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:20,066
Yeah.

340
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,706
Hello.

341
00:22:24,778 --> 00:22:26,678
Hello.

342
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:31,583
Okay.

343
00:22:34,387 --> 00:22:36,753
Chan, can I talk to you
for a second?

344
00:22:36,923 --> 00:22:38,982
Sure. What's up?

345
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:42,219
Just one additional
relationship thought.

346
00:22:42,395 --> 00:22:45,193
Something you're probably
already familiar with.

347
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:46,491
Women talk.

348
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:48,823
