1
00:00:07,954 --> 00:00:09,387
你在笑什么？
What's so funny?

2
00:00:09,623 --> 00:00:13,685
没有，这是演技练习 我在练假笑
Nothing. lt's an acting exercise. l'm practicing my fake laugh.

3
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,737
你在笑什么？
What? What's so funny?

4
00:00:24,645 --> 00:00:26,944
不行，店里不准抽烟
No, no. There's none of that in here.

5
00:00:27,215 --> 00:00:30,276
至少让我抽完这一根
Come on. At least let me finish this last one.

6
00:00:31,455 --> 00:00:33,286
好，但你得分我一口
Only if you give me a drag.

7
00:00:42,003 --> 00:00:45,337
妖女，我又吻上你的唇了
Oh, dark mother, once again l suckle at your smoky teat.

8
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,741
整根都给你吧
Why don't you hold on to that one.

9
00:01:00,263 --> 00:01:03,097
这是最不好玩的游戏
That's like the least fun game ever.

10
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,202
我受够了，我带了一样东西
l'm sick of your smoking, so l brought something...

11
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:09,034
可以帮助你戒烟
...that is going to help you quit.

12
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:17,118
这个戒烟帖布不好用
That patch is no good.

13
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,152
这是催眠录音带
lt's a hypnosis tape.

14
00:01:23,396 --> 00:01:27,094
我一个同事听了 两星期后再也没抽过烟
A woman at work used it for two weeks and hasn't smoked since.

15
00:01:30,306 --> 00:01:31,637
你有什么意见？
What's your problem?

16
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:35,676
没什么，只不过催眠是骗人的
Nothing. lt's just that hypnosis is beyond crap.

17
00:01:37,116 --> 00:01:39,677
我在亚特兰大看过你被催眠
l watched you get hypnotized in Atlantic City.

18
00:01:39,921 --> 00:01:42,322
那家伙没把我催眠，好吗？
That guy did not hypnotize me, okay?

19
00:01:42,658 --> 00:01:46,527
是啊，你总是脱裤子 用屁股“通杀”
You always pull your pants down and play ''Wipe Out'' on your butt.

20
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:49,929
别用催眠了
Forget hypnosis.

21
00:01:50,135 --> 00:01:53,765
想戒烟就得去石南地上裸舞
The way to quit smoking is to dance naked in a field of heather...

22
00:01:54,007 --> 00:01:57,205
然后用六个壮丁的汗水沐浴
...and then bathe in the sweat of six healthy, young men.

23
00:01:58,347 --> 00:02:01,442
我爸管它叫“周四夜狂欢”
Or what my father calls ''Thursday night.''

24
00:02:02,487 --> 00:02:04,648

28
00:02:53,994 --> 00:02:55,359

你怎么来了？
What are you doing here?

32
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:12,848
我本来想先打电话 但是号码弄丢了
l would've called, but l lost your number.

33
00:03:13,088 --> 00:03:17,287
我妈把我锁在门外 我没办法进去找
And then my mom locked me out of the house, so l couldn't find it.

34
00:03:17,695 --> 00:03:22,030
我找了一具公共电话 话筒却被剪断了
Then l tried to find a pay phone, and the receiver was cut off.

35
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:25,295
怎么了？
What happened?

36
00:03:26,341 --> 00:03:27,899
有人破坏公物
Vandalism.

37
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:31,876
那你和你妈怎么了？
But also, what happened between you and your mom?

38
00:03:32,483 --> 00:03:36,614
我们吵架，她说我 不够成熟，不能结婚
We got in a fight. She said that l was too immature to get married.

39
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:38,948
你要结婚了？
You're getting married?

40
00:03:41,663 --> 00:03:44,132
我的弟弟要结婚了
My little brother's getting married!

41
00:03:44,968 --> 00:03:49,201
我就知道你会替我高兴 你想见她吗？
l knew you'd be so cool about this. Do you wanna meet her?

42
00:03:49,475 --> 00:03:50,635
你说呢？
Do l?

43
00:03:51,076 --> 00:03:52,304
你想吗？
Do you?

44
00:03:53,313 --> 00:03:54,337
当然想
Yeah, l do.

45
00:03:54,615 --> 00:03:57,915
太好了，她正在停卡车
Cool, all right. She's just parking the truck.

46
00:03:58,721 --> 00:04:01,748
我去带我的未婚妻来
l gonna go get my fiancée, man!

47
00:04:04,596 --> 00:04:08,863
我就知道他会最早结婚
l'd have bet good money that he'd be the first one of us to get married.

48
00:04:09,336 --> 00:04:10,860
这不是很棒吗？
lsn't it fantastic?

49
00:04:11,205 --> 00:04:14,266
你不觉得他稍嫌年轻？
Don't you think he's a little young to get married?

50
00:04:14,511 --> 00:04:15,535
他已经18岁了
Well, he's 18.

51
00:04:15,812 --> 00:04:19,214
他在最后单身派对上不能喝酒
lt'll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.

52
00:04:19,851 --> 00:04:22,116
也不能叫鸡
Yeah, or to get a hooker.

53
00:04:23,057 --> 00:04:25,287
叫鸡本来就违法
Always illegal, Joe.

54
00:04:27,763 --> 00:04:30,358
这是我的未婚妻
This is my fiancée...

55
00:04:30,634 --> 00:04:32,067
奈特老师
...Mrs. lKnight.

56
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:35,605
那是我姐姐
That's my sister.

57
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:37,332
说来好笑
You know, it's funny.

58
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:41,842
法兰克经常提到你 你却跟我想像的不一样
Frank told me so much about you, but you're not how l pictured you at all.

59
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:44,818
是啊，我很令人意外
Yeah, l'm a big surprise.

60
00:04:46,724 --> 00:04:48,021
坐吧
Here, grab a seat.

61
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:50,820
你们是怎么认识的？
So how did you guys meet?

62
00:04:51,097 --> 00:04:53,726
我去上奈特老师的…
l was in Mrs. lKnight's....

63
00:04:53,934 --> 00:04:57,928
我是说爱丽丝 抱歉，我老是叫错
l mean, Alice. Sorry. l always do that.

64
00:05:00,043 --> 00:05:01,840
我去上她的家政课
l was in her home-ec class.

65
00:05:02,146 --> 00:05:03,545
他是我最好的学生
He was my best student.

66
00:05:03,815 --> 00:05:05,976
她是我最好的老师
She was my best teacher.

67
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,399
真是让学生不跷课的好方法
lf that doesn't keep kids in school, what will?

68
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,499
你们要结婚了？
And so now you guys are gonna be married?

69
00:05:25,012 --> 00:05:28,972
我们本来只考虑同居
We talked about just living together...

70
00:05:30,254 --> 00:05:32,188
但是我们想马上生小孩
...but we want kids right away.

71
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,389
天哪
Oh, my God!

72
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,563
太好了
Great!

73
00:05:40,034 --> 00:05:43,266
小孩？法兰克 你真的准备好了？
lKids. Frank, are you sure you're ready for that?

74
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,298
能有多难？
How hard can it be?

75
00:05:45,576 --> 00:05:49,809
谁不想要小宝宝，对吧？
You know, l mean, babies. Who doesn't want babies? Right?

76
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,483
而且我一直没有爸爸陪伴
And besides, l never had a dad around.

77
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:57,590
以后就有了，因为我就是爸爸
And now l always will, because it'll be me.

78
00:06:01,131 --> 00:06:04,898
我们知道我们的岁数差很多
Really, we do realize that there's an age difference between us.

79
00:06:05,137 --> 00:06:07,732
那就好 你们看起来好像不知道
Good. Because you were acting like you didn't.

80
00:06:08,142 --> 00:06:11,977
但是在爱情里，年龄不是问题
But when it comes to love, what does age matter?

81
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,320
你正在进入梦乡
You are falling fast asleep.

82
00:06:21,661 --> 00:06:24,324
越睡越沉，越睡越沉
Deeper, deeper, deeper.

83
00:06:24,832 --> 00:06:27,233
你已经睡着了
You are now completely asleep.

84
00:06:27,469 --> 00:06:29,664
你不需要抽烟
You don't need to smoke.

85
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:32,500
香烟不能控制你
Cigarettes don't control you.

86
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:35,906
你是坚强、有自信的女性
You are a strong, confident woman...

87
00:06:36,182 --> 00:06:38,651
你不需要抽烟
... who does not need to smoke.

88
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:41,650
坚强、有自信的女性
A strong, confident woman.

89
00:06:44,261 --> 00:06:45,057
你知道吗？
You know what?

90
00:06:45,362 --> 00:06:49,299
我发现去年我只和 李察、胡立欧交往过
l realized in the last year l've only gone out with Richard and Julio.

91
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:53,168
你得帮我牵线，让我重回情场
You gotta help me out, set me up. Get me back in the game.

92
00:06:53,374 --> 00:06:54,398
没问题
Not a problem.

93
00:06:54,675 --> 00:06:58,373
我在时装界工作 身边全是异性恋好男人
l work in fashion, and all l meet are eligible straight men.

94
00:07:01,118 --> 00:07:02,642
你还要什么？
Can l get you something else?

95
00:07:02,887 --> 00:07:05,686
起司蛋糕 和一次约会，如果有的话
Cheesecake and a date, if you're giving them out.

96
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,158
我们不是谈过了吗？
Haven't we covered that topic?

97
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:09,989
你刚才对她说…
You just said to her--

98
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:11,858
你想跟我约会
You wanna go out with me...

99
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:15,401
是因为我是金发、波霸 还端吃的给你
...because of my wig, the big boobs, and l serve you food.

100
00:07:15,706 --> 00:07:18,107
那我找我姑姑就行了
lf that were true, l'd be dating my Aunt Ruth.

101
00:07:20,012 --> 00:07:23,141
我们一起出门两次，都蛮惨的
And the two times we went out, it was plain awkward.

102
00:07:24,218 --> 00:07:27,052
你觉得她应该和我约会吧？
You think she should go out with me, don't you?

103
00:07:30,761 --> 00:07:32,729
你真的想跟她约会？
You sure you wanna go out with her?

104
00:07:32,931 --> 00:07:35,058
早上会惨不忍睹喔
That ain't a pretty picture in the morning.

105
00:07:36,102 --> 00:07:40,734
假发乱成一团 义乳扔在床头柜上
That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the nightstand.

106
00:07:42,345 --> 00:07:43,676
你考虑一下
Think about it.

107
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:44,846
我会的
Oh, l will.

108
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:50,917
我知道这是法兰克的人生
No, l know. l know that this is Frank's life.

109
00:07:52,892 --> 00:07:56,351
我不想批评 但这样是变态、是错的
l don't wanna be judgmental, but it's sick. lt's sick and wrong!

110
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,734
因为年龄的关系？
What, is it the age thing?

111
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,666
我本来不在乎年龄
l'm fine with the age thing...

112
00:08:01,872 --> 00:08:05,001
直到她把舌头往我弟的喉咙伸
...until it sticks its tongue down my brother's throat.

113
00:08:06,513 --> 00:08:08,880
菲比，他看起来很爽
Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.

114
00:08:09,684 --> 00:08:13,348
等他忙着帮一堆宝宝换尿布
You think he'll enjoy it when he's up to his elbows in diapers...

115
00:08:13,556 --> 00:08:16,492
你觉得他还会爽吗？
...of all the babies they have to have right away?

116
00:08:17,228 --> 00:08:21,165
这样对法兰克不公平 也对宝宝不公平
This is not fair to Frank, and it's not fair to the babies.

117
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:23,996
这可不是好的家政
You know what? lt's not good home economics.

118
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:28,635
你跟他说过吗？
Have you told him how you feel?

119
00:08:28,912 --> 00:08:31,279
有，但没有说出声音
Yes. Not out loud.

120
00:08:32,517 --> 00:08:36,750
你不说，他就要结婚了 你会恨你自己
lf you don't tell him, soon he'll be married, then you'll hate yourself.

121
00:08:37,057 --> 00:08:40,459
我要是说了，他会恨我
Yeah, but if l do tell him, then he's gonna hate myself.

122
00:08:41,096 --> 00:08:44,191
你看看他和他妈妈，我不能说
Look at him and his mom. l can't.

123
00:08:46,303 --> 00:08:48,636
但是你们可以，你们去劝阻他
But you guys can. You talk him out of it.

124
00:08:51,144 --> 00:08:52,873
拜托啦
Come on, you guys.

125
00:08:54,582 --> 00:08:57,381
你们没有损失 我却会失去一切
You have nothing to lose. l have everything to lose.

126
00:08:57,619 --> 00:09:00,054
你们要我失去一切吗？
Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?

127
00:09:05,398 --> 00:09:07,389
好，我去找法兰克
Okay, l'm gonna go get Frank.

128
00:09:10,071 --> 00:09:13,337
刚才走在街上，我对你说
We're walking down the street, and l turn to you and say:

129
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:16,705
“去脱衣酒吧坐坐” 记得吗？
''Let's go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes.'' Remember?

130
00:09:16,948 --> 00:09:20,441
然后你说“去你家就好了”
And then you say, ''Let's just hang out at your place.''

131
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,246
好明智啊，猪头
Well, that was a nice move, dumb ass.

132
00:09:24,926 --> 00:09:27,361
你应该跟他约会
l think you should go out with this guy.

133
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,361
他对我一点吸引力也没有
He doesn't do anything for me.

134
00:09:29,566 --> 00:09:33,731
上周六的 “猛龙过江”演什么？
Last Saturday night, what happened on Walker, Texas Ranger?

135
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:38,136
沃克在找一车子的小孩…
Walker was looking for this big busload of kids.

136
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,877
我懂你的意思了
All right, l get your point.

137
00:09:43,453 --> 00:09:46,548
我一年前就忘了它的密码
l forgot the combination to this about a year ago.

138
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,485
我只是拎着装样子
l just carry it around.

139
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,120
你们有护唇膏吗？
You got any Chap Stick?

140
00:09:53,233 --> 00:09:54,825
录音带听得怎样？
How are those tapes working out?

141
00:09:55,069 --> 00:09:57,504
很有效，我今天还没抽烟
Good. l haven't smoked yet today.

142
00:09:57,773 --> 00:10:02,108
清爽又有自信 好漂亮的上衣
l feel great and confident. That is a stunning blouse.

143
00:10:05,518 --> 00:10:06,382
谢谢
Thank you.

144
00:10:07,588 --> 00:10:08,816
拿去 谢了
-Here you go. -Thanks.

145
00:10:10,158 --> 00:10:13,959
给彼特一个机会 他既风趣，人又好
Let's give Pete a chance. He was funny. He seems really nice.

146
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:16,098
而且支票的事好可爱
That check thing was adorable.

147
00:10:16,334 --> 00:10:17,824
什么支票？
What check thing?

148
00:10:18,102 --> 00:10:23,201
有个喜欢我的顾客开玩笑 给我两万元的小费
As a joke, this customer who has a crush on me, gave me a $20,000 tip.

149
00:10:23,477 --> 00:10:26,174
他的电话在支票上 他要我打给他
His number's on the check. He did it so l'd call.

150
00:10:26,448 --> 00:10:28,211
彼特贝克，彼特…
Pete Becker. Pete--

151
00:10:35,561 --> 00:10:36,528
是他吗？
ls this him?

152
00:10:37,231 --> 00:10:38,289
那是总统
That's Bill Clinton.

153
00:10:40,635 --> 00:10:42,125
他抱着谁？
Who's he hugging?

154
00:10:43,974 --> 00:10:47,741
天哪，是彼特 总统为什么抱着彼特？
Oh, my God. That's Pete. Why is Bill hugging Pete?

155
00:10:48,013 --> 00:10:49,708
他发明了摩斯865
This guy invented Moss 865.

156
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,477
全世界的公司都在用这个程式
Every office in the world uses that program.

157
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,813
我们也在用 你看吧
-We use it! -There you go!

158
00:10:56,024 --> 00:10:58,721
摩妮卡要跟百万富翁约会了
Monica's gonna go out with a millionaire.

159
00:10:59,263 --> 00:11:01,288
我才不跟他约会
l'm not gonna go out with him.

160
00:11:01,499 --> 00:11:05,334
这居然是真的两万元支票 好兴奋喔
l can't believe this is a real $20,000 check. This is so exciting.

161
00:11:05,972 --> 00:11:07,837
或是令人火大
Or incredibly offensive.

162
00:11:08,142 --> 00:11:09,507
对，也有
Yeah, sure. That too.

163
00:11:22,496 --> 00:11:24,020
怎样？
What?

164
00:11:25,634 --> 00:11:28,365
我们的意思是，不要操之过急
All we're saying is, don't rush into anything.

165
00:11:28,638 --> 00:11:32,700
你想想：你18岁，她44岁
Come on, think about it. You're 18. She's 44.

166
00:11:33,178 --> 00:11:36,410
等你36岁，她就88岁了
When you're 36, she's gonna be 88.

167
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,146
你以为我不知道？
You don't think l know that?

168
00:11:43,527 --> 00:11:45,154
重点是…
The point is...

169
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:48,933
你还可以跟很多女人上床
...there's a lot of women you haven't had sex with yet.

170
00:11:49,201 --> 00:11:52,171
他说得对，这是你的天下
He's right. He's right. This is your time.

171
00:11:52,406 --> 00:11:56,434
你年轻，你古怪 女生最喜欢了
You're young. You're weird. Chicks dig that.

172
00:11:56,713 --> 00:12:00,844
跟一个你很喜欢的人做 感觉不是更棒？
lsn't sex better when it's with one person that you really care about?

173
00:12:01,386 --> 00:12:03,445
在诗里吧
Yeah, in a poem, maybe.

174
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:08,016
不，他说得对 我跟瑞秋就是那样
No, the man's right. That's what l had with Rachel.

175
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:09,560
现在没有了？
Not anymore?

176
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:13,891
没了，我跟别人上了床
No. l slept with someone else.

177
00:12:14,137 --> 00:12:17,232
等等，那样对事情有帮助吗？
So wait. So how did that make things better?

178
00:12:18,844 --> 00:12:20,334
没有
lt didn't.

179
00:12:22,015 --> 00:12:25,349
你跟瑞秋的感觉 就是我和爱丽丝的感觉
What you used to have with Rachel is what l got with Alice.

180
00:12:25,553 --> 00:12:27,145
那是什么感觉？
Now, what is that like?

181
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,721
很棒的感觉
lt's so cool, man.

182
00:12:28,992 --> 00:12:33,362
因为跟她在一起 比不跟她在一起快乐多了
lt's because being with her is so much better than not being with her.

183
00:12:35,001 --> 00:12:38,062
我为什么找不到？ 我拥有过，却搞砸了
-Why can't l find that? -l had it and l blew it.

184
00:12:38,272 --> 00:12:39,671
我想要！
Well, l want it!

185
00:12:39,908 --> 00:12:40,840
你一定可以拥有
You can have it.

186
00:12:41,076 --> 00:12:43,602
也许我有毛病
Maybe there's something wrong with me.

187
00:12:43,947 --> 00:12:47,679
你会找到的 我见过，也拥有了
No, it's out there, man. l've seen it! l got it!

188
00:12:48,754 --> 00:12:51,383
那你就要好好把握 好
-Then, you hold on to it! -All right, man!

189
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:54,254
死小子，恭喜你
All right! Congratulations, you lucky bastard!

190
00:12:54,963 --> 00:12:56,692
你是法兰克的伴郎？
You're Frank's best man?

191
00:12:59,235 --> 00:13:01,727
我没办法，他们的爱好纯洁
l couldn't help it. Their love is so pure.

192
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:04,899
那你呢？
What about you, huh?

193
00:13:05,545 --> 00:13:06,876
我帮他拿戒指
l'm the ring bearer.

194
00:13:26,007 --> 00:13:29,967
你来了就好 我有一个家政惨案
l'm so glad you could come. l've got a real home-ec emergency.

195
00:13:30,214 --> 00:13:32,945
天哪，谁死了？
Oh, my God. Who died on this?

196
00:13:33,552 --> 00:13:35,349
芥末酱倒了
lt's a real ''mustard-tastrophe.''

197
00:13:36,923 --> 00:13:37,719
你有办法吗？
Can you help?

198
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:42,119
当然有，先用苏打水加盐清洗
Absolutely. First, we'll start with a little club soda and salt.

199
00:13:42,432 --> 00:13:45,459
要是洗不掉，就… 算了，它已经毁了
-Then if that doesn't work-- -Forget it. lt's ruined.

200
00:13:45,736 --> 00:13:49,400
别这么说，要是洗不掉 就剪掉脏污部份
Never say that. lf you can't get it out, cut around the stain...

201
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:53,077
缝一点蕾丝 就是一条漂亮的遮布
...add a little lace, you make a stylish throw.

202
00:13:54,048 --> 00:13:57,485
又或者，你可以 不要嫁给我弟弟
Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother, Frank?

203
00:14:02,327 --> 00:14:05,354
能不能让它小到 可以放在针尖上？
Can we make it smaller? Make it fit on the head of a pin?

204
00:14:05,565 --> 00:14:08,558
我喜欢生产这种小东西
l love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.

205
00:14:10,705 --> 00:14:12,536
摩妮卡盖勒来访
You have Monica Geller here.

206
00:14:12,742 --> 00:14:14,767
好的，让她进来
Absolutely. Yeah, send her in.

207
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:20,109
这是什么意思？
What the hell is this?

208
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,285
等一下…明天早上再谈？
Hang on for a sec. l'll talk to you in the morning?

209
00:14:23,524 --> 00:14:24,354
好的
You got it.

210
00:14:25,694 --> 00:14:26,922
对不起，什么？
l'm sorry. What?

211
00:14:27,196 --> 00:14:28,629
这是什么意思？
What's this supposed to mean?

212
00:14:28,866 --> 00:14:32,030
我一直不会算小费
Well, you know, l never know how much to tip.

213
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,139
把加税乘以二 不是把罗马尼亚的税收乘以二
You double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania.

214
00:14:39,414 --> 00:14:43,215
你要买我吗？ 你都这样约女孩子？
Are you buying me? ls this how you get girls to go out with you?

215
00:14:43,453 --> 00:14:45,752
我还在
I'm still here.

216
00:14:48,828 --> 00:14:51,923
你误会了 要是我没给这笔小费
You're taking this wrong. lf l didn't leave you that tip...

217
00:14:52,132 --> 00:14:55,398
你就不会来，我们不会争吵
...you wouldn't have come, we wouldn't have this argument...

218
00:14:55,638 --> 00:14:58,164
也不会有这种紧张的气氛
...and there wouldn't be this heat between us.

219
00:14:59,242 --> 00:15:03,612
你得承认我们的关系有进展了
You gotta admit that our relationship is hitting a new level now.

220
00:15:03,849 --> 00:15:06,318
以前你是厨师，我是顾客
You were the chef and l was the customer.

221
00:15:06,586 --> 00:15:08,611
现在我们是两个争吵的人
But now we're this couple that fights.

222
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:12,726
你是个疯子
You're a loon.

223
00:15:13,631 --> 00:15:17,568
别管这张支票了，我喜欢你
Look, forget the check, okay? l like you.

224
00:15:17,802 --> 00:15:19,793
我觉得你很棒
l think you're great.

225
00:15:20,707 --> 00:15:22,140
怎么样？
Come on, what do you say?

226
00:15:24,813 --> 00:15:26,110
我不知道
l don't know.

227
00:15:26,415 --> 00:15:27,643
为什么？
Why not?

228
00:15:28,652 --> 00:15:31,053
我不想鼓励这种行为
l don't wanna encourage this behavior.

229
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:36,159
我只求一顿饭，好吗？
One meal. That's all l'm asking for. Please?

230
00:15:36,764 --> 00:15:38,163
我们出去吃饭
We go out, we eat.

231
00:15:38,466 --> 00:15:42,028
要是玩得不开心 我给你一万，我们扯平
lf you don't have a good time, l'll give you 10 grand, we're even.

232
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:58,026
不，把信放下，是我
Wait, no. Just put the mail down. lt's me.

233
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:02,559
对不起，你怎么不开灯？
Sorry. Why were you just all in the dark?

234
00:16:02,802 --> 00:16:07,764
你的衣服好香，我就窝在里面
Your laundry smelled so good that l thought l'd curl up in it.

235
00:16:08,242 --> 00:16:10,142
没关系吧？ 没关系
-ls that all right? -Yeah, sure.

236
00:16:10,446 --> 00:16:11,743
今天过得怎样？
So how was your day?

237
00:16:11,981 --> 00:16:15,884
可能是我有生以来最惨的一天
lt's just probably the worst one since l've been alive.

238
00:16:18,991 --> 00:16:20,652
怎么了？
What happened?

239
00:16:21,395 --> 00:16:24,888
爱丽丝改变心意了
Alice.... She called it off.

240
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:31,564
她有说原因吗？
Did she say why?

241
00:16:32,244 --> 00:16:34,235
没有，她只说我太年轻
No. Just that l was too young.

242
00:16:34,481 --> 00:16:37,144
我怎么突然变年轻了？
l don't see how l could suddenly be too young...

243
00:16:37,351 --> 00:16:40,947
刚交往时，她还说我老成
...because l'm older than l was when we first got together.

244
00:16:45,096 --> 00:16:49,967
不晓得，但是你知道吗？ 或许这样也好
l don't know. But you know what? Maybe it's just all for the best.

245
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:53,698
是啊，但是我好痛苦
Well, yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain.

246
00:16:54,276 --> 00:16:56,005
亲爱的
Oh, sweetie.

247
00:16:56,646 --> 00:16:59,514
我好不容易感到快乐
You know, l was just finally happy.

248
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:02,376
这是生平第一次
For the first time in my life...

249
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:04,912
先是爸爸离开我…
...after my dad left me...

250
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:10,257
然后偷鸟被逮捕…
...and then getting arrested for stealing those birds...

251
00:17:10,633 --> 00:17:14,229
然后又肺穿孔
...and then the whole punctured-lung thing.

252
00:17:15,573 --> 00:17:19,032
天气一冷，我还是很难深呼吸
lt's still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather...

253
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:23,216
但是有了爱丽丝 这些都不见了
...but with Alice, all that stuff kind of went away.

254
00:17:24,486 --> 00:17:28,856
现在我失去了，却不知道原因
And now it's gone, and l don't know why.

255
00:17:30,962 --> 00:17:34,455
我可以告诉你，是我害的
Well, l can tell you why. lt's because of me.

256
00:17:35,769 --> 00:17:39,206
不过我是爱你才这么做
But you know what? l only did it because l love you, okay?

257
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,273
什么？
What?

258
00:17:42,512 --> 00:17:45,346
我跟爱丽丝聊了一下
l kind of had a little chat with Alice...

259
00:17:45,617 --> 00:17:49,452
让她明白你们为何不能在一起
...and l sort of made her see why you two shouldn't be together.

260
00:17:49,689 --> 00:17:52,818
你总有一天也会明白，真的
And you'll see it too, one day. You really, really will.

261
00:17:53,127 --> 00:17:55,596
等一下，是你造成的？
Wait a minute. This is because of you?

262
00:17:57,467 --> 00:18:00,130
我妈反对我们在一起
My mother didn't want us to be together...

263
00:18:00,338 --> 00:18:03,172
但是她顶多把我绑在门廊上
...but the worst thing she did was tie me to the porch.

264
00:18:05,646 --> 00:18:09,242
我觉得你能了解，所以来找你
l came to you because l thought you'd understand.

265
00:18:14,324 --> 00:18:16,349
我很想摔门走人
l would storm out of here...

266
00:18:16,594 --> 00:18:19,996
但是我没钱、没地方去
...if l had some money or a place to go.

267
00:18:26,509 --> 00:18:28,500
天哪，大富豪来了
Oh, my God! The millionaire's here!

268
00:18:28,812 --> 00:18:30,302
天哪
Oh, my God!

269
00:18:35,722 --> 00:18:38,191
我只是要跟他吃顿饭
l'm just gonna have dinner with him.

270
00:18:38,459 --> 00:18:43,023
他请你吃饭 并不代表你欠他什么
Okay, just because he buys you dinner does not mean you owe him anything.

271
00:18:44,869 --> 00:18:45,801
我知道
l know.

272
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,166
那记得点龙虾
Okay, then get the lobster.

273
00:18:58,088 --> 00:19:00,683
你口袋里有多少现金？
How much cash you got in your pocket now?

274
00:19:03,329 --> 00:19:06,595
我就不请你进来坐了
And that's why l'm not inviting you in for a drink.

275
00:19:07,201 --> 00:19:09,431
进来坐一下嘛
Why not? Hey, come in for drink.

276
00:19:10,974 --> 00:19:13,443
你想去哪里？ 喜欢吃披萨吗？
-Where do you wanna go? -You like pizza?

277
00:19:13,711 --> 00:19:16,647
听起来不错 有一家馆子不错
-That sounds great. -l know a great little place.

278
00:19:22,857 --> 00:19:24,825
我不能让你付钱
You're not paying for the pizza.

279
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:28,224
这样很公平，你出了机票钱
Come on, it's only fair. You paid for the flight.

280
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,357
这些里拉够吗？
ls that enough lira?

281
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:32,833
再丢个一千
l'd throw another 1000 on that.

282
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,907
这样是多少？ 大约60毛美金
-How much is that? -That's about 60 cents.

283
00:19:47,426 --> 00:19:49,360
每天晚上都这样
Every night!

284
00:19:51,332 --> 00:19:53,527
你不需要抽烟
You don't need to smoke.

285
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:56,330
香烟不能控制你
Cigarettes don't control you.

286
00:19:56,606 --> 00:20:00,008
你是坚强、有自信的女性
You are a strong, confident woman...

287
00:20:00,545 --> 00:20:02,878
你不需要抽烟

288
00:20:03,315 --> 00:20:06,342
坚强、有自信的女性

289
00:20:06,721 --> 00:20:09,316
不需要抽烟
... who does not need to smoke.

290
00:20:21,542 --> 00:20:25,309
我知道你觉得我做了大坏事
Look, l know that you think l did this totally evil thing.

291
00:20:25,581 --> 00:20:27,071
但是我没有
But l so didn't.

292
00:20:28,118 --> 00:20:31,282
有一个人可以解释得比我清楚
Someone's here who can explain this better than l can.

293
00:20:43,173 --> 00:20:44,936
奈特老师
Hi, Mrs. lKnight.

294
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,438
法兰克，菲比说得对
Phoebe's right, Frank.

295
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:54,018
这话不中听，但我们不该结婚
lt's hard to hear, but it would've been wrong to go through with it.

296
00:20:54,256 --> 00:20:55,917
我太自私了
l was being selfish.

297
00:20:56,126 --> 00:20:59,927
我们现在追求相同的东西
Even though we want the same things right now...

298
00:21:00,165 --> 00:21:02,930
未来却不见得如此
...in the future, we may not.

299
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,562
对不对？ 对，但不只如此
-ls that what it is? -Yes, but not just that.

300
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:08,105
不只如此
Not just that.

301
00:21:11,815 --> 00:21:16,914
虽然我们现在非常相爱
Even though we love each other as much as we do...

302
00:21:17,824 --> 00:21:19,257
然而…
...nonetheless....

303
00:21:21,662 --> 00:21:23,152
然而…
Nonetheless.

304
00:21:28,572 --> 00:21:30,837
你还年轻…
You're too young...

305
00:21:31,343 --> 00:21:34,643
不晓得你要什么
...to really know what you want.

306
00:21:34,915 --> 00:21:36,849
没错
That's right, exactly.

307
00:21:39,188 --> 00:21:41,247
你们在吻别，很好
That's a goodbye kiss. That's good.

308
00:21:43,661 --> 00:21:45,026
再见
Bye-bye.

309
00:21:46,131 --> 00:21:50,466
总之希望你了解我的意思
The important thing is, is that you see what l'm saying.

310
00:21:51,171 --> 00:21:53,436
这么做摆明是错的
This is clearly wrong.

311
00:21:54,944 --> 00:21:57,436
我绝不会袖手旁观
l've decided l'm gonna let this happen.

312
00:21:58,816 --> 00:22:00,716
我要拿皮包
Can l just get my purse?

313
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:03,220
好吧，算了
Okay, all right, good.

314
00:22:08,363 --> 00:22:10,696
香烟不能控制你
Cigarettes don't control you.

315
00:22:10,967 --> 00:22:13,937
你是坚强、有自信的女性

316
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:17,106
你不需要抽烟

317
00:22:19,112 --> 00:22:22,241
乔伊是你最要好的朋友
Joey's your best friend.

318
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:26,951
你要每天为他做起司三明治
You wanna make him a cheese sandwich every day.

319
00:22:29,361 --> 00:22:34,494
你还要送他一条几百块的裤子
And you also wanna buy him hundreds of dollars worth of pants.
