1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:03,040
再见
Bye-bye.

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,540
我在米雪餐厅订好位子了…
I just got us reservations at Michelle's...

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,870
还有《音乐人》的票来庆祝…
...and tickets to The Music Man to celebrate...

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,710
我们成为订婚夫妻后第一个正式的节日
...our first holiday season as a betrothed couple.

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,890
-“订婚 -订婚夫妻
- "Betrothed." - Betrothed couple.

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,250
-嘿! -嘿!
- Hey! - Hi!

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,090
菲比?
Pheebs?

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,860
骷髅头?
Skull?

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,360
是啊，是我妈的
Yeah, it's my mom's.

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,090
我的天!
Oh, my God!

11
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,830
不，不，不是我妈
No, no, no. It's not my mom.

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,530
是属于我妈的
It belonged to my mom.

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,340
她以前每次圣诞节都会拿出来…
She used to put it out every Christmas...

14
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,840
要我们记得即使圣诞节还是会死人的
...to remind us that even though it's Christmas, people still die.

15
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,380
可以放糖果在里面
And you can put candy in it.

16
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,680
-嘿 -嘿
- Hey. - Hey.

17
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,950
甘草霜?
Licorice?

18
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,720
好啊
Sure.

19
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,660
-今年班和我一起过节 -太好了!
- I get Ben for the holidays this year. - That's great!

20
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,460
-你要扮成圣诞老人吗? -不
- Are you gonna dress up as Santa? - Nope.

21
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,460
我知道苏珊每年都这么做…
I mean, I know Susan does every year...

22
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,570
可是今年我想教他了解光明节
...but I want to take this year to teach him about Hanukkah.

23
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,140
也许我能教班…
And maybe I could teach Ben...

24
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,170
有关圣诞骷髅头和人怎么死亡
...about the Christmas skull and how people die.

25
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,370
你可以在今年教班认识菲比
You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.

26
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,610
嘿
Hey.

27
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,690
-你知道他在里面吗? -不知道
- Did you know he was in there? - No.

28
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,930
-我们回来多久了? -大概半小时
- How long have we been home? - About half an hour.

29
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,430
好极了
Lovely.

30
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,330
Friends  S07E10 佳节犰狳
The One With The Holiday Armadillo

31
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,670
你知道我在想什么?我们结婚后，你要不要
You know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna...

32
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,430
改姓“宾”?
...change your last name to "Bing"?

33
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,740
不要
No.

34
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,910
为什么不?
Why not?

35
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,120
“宾”很奇怪
"Bing" is weird.

36
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,380
我明白你的意思，盖勒!
Yeah, I know what you mean. Gellar!

37
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,530
你们好
Oh, hey, you guys.

38
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,460
猜猜怎么着，我房东刚通知我 我的房子快好了
Guess what. My landlord just called. My apartment's gonna be ready soon.

39
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,160
我很快就搬出去了
So I guess I'll be moving out.

40
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,030
菲比，我会想念你的
Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you.

41
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,140
是啊，你会很伤心
Yes, you will be very sad.

42
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:49,830
-我要告诉瑞秋这个好消息 -你们要再一起住?
- I gotta go tell Rachel the good news. - You guys are gonna live together again?

43
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,770
-是啊，为什么不? -她和乔伊住得很开心
- Yeah, why not? - She's just having so much fun with Joey...

44
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,280
我以为她还会继续和他住在一起
...I just assumed she'd still be living with him.

45
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,150
为什么你认为她和乔伊住得很开心?
Why do you think she's having so much fun living with Joey?

46
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,620
没为什么，除了…
No reason, except she...

47
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,580
她这么说
...told me.

48
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,490
真的? 她说她不要和我住?
Really? She said she didn't want to live with me?

49
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,420
没有，她没有这么说
No. No, she didn't say that.

50
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:11,320
我想你该和莫妮卡说话了
I think you should talk to Monica now.

51
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,490
菲比，别担心 我确定她想和你住的
Phoebe, don't worry. I'm sure she wants to live with you.

52
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,290
你确定? 你很肯定?
You're sure? You're absolutely sure?

53
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,870
不，我打赌她大概会
No, but I'll bet she probably does.

54
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,200
大概
Oh, probably?

55
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,770
我不喜欢这个字
I don't like that word.

56
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,640
我知道“大概”真正的意思，是啊，是啊
I know what "probably" really means. Yeah, yeah.

57
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,710
“你妈大概不会自杀”
"Oh, your mom probably won't kill herself."

58
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,750
“葬礼导演大概不认识你”
You know, "No, the funeral director probably won't hit on you."

59
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,520
“那对好心的夫妇大概会收养你” 好了，对不起
"Yeah, that nice couple probably will adopt you. " Okay, I'm sorry.

60
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,890
对不起，我不要把我和瑞秋…
I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes...

61
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,120
住在一起的希望寄托在“大概”上面
...of Rachel and I living together on "probably."

62
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,960
人在这世上要自己照顾自己
You gotta take care of yourself in this world.

63
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,470
历史教训完全没用
History teaches us nothing.

64
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,800
“宾”现在不是那么奇怪了吧?
"Bing" doesn't seem so weird now, does it?

65
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,540
太好了，你在家
Great, you're home.

66
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,080
猜猜菲比送我什么圣诞礼物
Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas.

67
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,320
-鼓? -不，鼓!
- Drums? - No, drums!

68
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,930
请给我们两个墨西哥卷外带
Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?

69
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,910
抱歉，不过没那么抱歉 因为你不用和他在一起生活
I'm sorry. But not that sorry, because you don't have to live with it.

70
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,480
我们用钱德宾的名字订了位子
We have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.

71
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,350
好的，大约再45分钟
Okay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.

72
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,510
45分钟? 《音乐人》的票是8点的
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to The Music Man at 8.

73
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,520
抱歉，圣诞节是最忙的时候
I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.

74
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,950
这是因为墨西哥卷的玩笑吗?
Is this because of the burrito thing?

75
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,830
-要给他钱 -给他钱? 那只是个玩笑!
- You need to give him money. - Give him money? It was a joke!

76
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,740
不，为了我们的位子这种地方都是死要钱的
No. To get a table. Places like this are always shaking you down.

77
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:02,300
-每个人都要小费 -好，镇静，欧玛丽（迪士尼动画《猫儿历险记》里的角色）
- Everybody wants a payoff. - All right, calm down, O'Malley.

78
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,640
-我会塞钱给他 -可是要不着痕迹
- I'll slip him some money. - But you've got to be smooth about it.

79
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,970
嘿，我可以不着痕迹
Hey, I can be smooth.

80
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,310
我们有点赶时间 如果可以让我们早一点
We're in a bit of a hurry, so if you could get us a table...

81
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,180
排到位子，我会很感激
...a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.

82
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,260
-当然，先生  -好
- Of course, sir. - Okay.

83
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,490
-怎么样? -钱在另一只手里
- How'd it go? - Had the money in the wrong hand.

84
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,260
你会不会…
Hey. You don't feel...

85
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,430
-想吐，会不会? -不会
...like you're gonna throw up, do you? - No.

86
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,580
我会，我们…
Well, I do. So let's...

87
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:41,210
班，你…
So, Ben, you...

88
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,880
你知道快过节了，对不对?
You know what holiday is coming up, don't you?

89
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,040
圣诞节
Christmas.

90
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:48,410
对，你知道另一个节日也要到了?
Yeah, and you know what other holiday is coming up?

91
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,950
平安夜
Christmas Eve.

92
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,890
对，但…
Yes, but also...

93
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,920
光明节也是!
Hanukkah!

94
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:01,900
你是一半犹太人，光明节是犹太人的节日
See, you're part Jewish, and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.

95
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,800
圣诞老人有会飞的驯鹿
Santa has reindeers that can fly.

96
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,470
对，但在光明节…
Right, but on Hanukkah...

97
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,900
光明节是庆祝一个奇迹
Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle.

98
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,940
很多年前有一群人叫做玛加伯人
See, years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.

99
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,540
好，对，是的…
Okay, that's right. Yes...

100
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,050
但在光明节，我们唱的是：
...but on Hanukkah, we sing:

101
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,890
好，这不是比赛
Okay, it's not a contest.

102
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,990
圣诞老人什么时候来?
When is Santa coming?

103
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:34,760
这样好不好 今年我们不要圣诞老人
How about this year, instead of Santa...

104
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,700
我们来庆祝光明节?
...we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?

105
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,660
没有圣诞老人?
No Santa?

106
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,500
我不乖吗?
Was I bad?

107
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,800
不，不，你没有不乖 你今年很乖，班
No. Oh, no, no. Hey, you weren't bad. You've been very good, Ben.

108
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:49,350
-圣诞老人生我的气 -不是，嘿，嘿
- Santa's mad at me. - No, hey, hey, come on.

109
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,950
班，圣诞老人没有生你的气，好吗?
Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay?

110
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,280
你是他最喜欢的小孩
You're his favorite little guy.

111
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,950
圣诞老人会来啦?
So Santa's coming?

112
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,780
对!
Yes!

113
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,650
圣诞老人会来
Santa's coming.

114
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,320
他会给我带来蚂蚁窝吗?
Will he bring me an ant farm?

115
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,390
你会放在妈妈那里吗?
Will you keep it at Mommy's?

116
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,660
-是的 -那当然了!
- Okay. - Then sure!

117
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:14,640
可能那小费不管用
Maybe this slipping-him-money thing is not gonna work.

118
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,940
也许我们只能等
Maybe we should just wait.

119
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,770
你不是说看不了《音乐人》就会死吗
You're the one who said you would die if you didn't see Music Man.

120
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,480
我没说“死”
I didn't say "die."

121
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,010
我说“哭”
I said "cry."

122
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,350
很简单，保持轻松
It's easy. Just keep it casual.

123
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,920
说句好话，和他握手，塞钱给他
Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money.

124
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:37,060
-你怎么这么了解? -我不知道
- How do you know so much about this? - I don't know.

125
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,160
理查以前常这么做，是不是?
Richard used to do it, didn't he?

126
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,100
我们现在可能已经在喝汤了
We'd be eating our soup right now.

127
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,440
该死的小胡子
Mustached bastard.

128
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:51,440
这些人刚走，快，给他钱
Okay, those people just left. Come on. Quick, give him the money.

129
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,270
对不起
Excuse me.

130
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,890
我们赶时间，可不可以…?
We're in a bit of a hurry. Can we...?

131
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,630
你喜欢鼓
So you like the drums.

132
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,780
真好
That's great.

133
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,910
我本来还担心它们会造成…
You know, I was worried that they would create maybe...

134
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,140
无法忍耐的居住状况
...an unbearable living situation.

135
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,410
好吧，看来没有，好!
But, okay, well, apparently not. So, yay!

136
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,690
菲比，我们学会了一首歌
Hey, Pheebs, we already learned a song.

137
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,320
准备好了，1，2，3，4
Ready? One, two, three, four.

138
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,060
龙舌兰酒!
Tequila!

139
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,490
很有趣
That's fun.

140
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,370
来了
Here you go.

141
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,680
谢谢，甘瑟，放在这里
Thank you, Gunther. Put her there.

142
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,310
用铜板并不比较容易
Definitely not easier with coins.

143
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,990
-谢谢 -谢谢
- Thank you. - Thank you.

144
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:11,920
-菲比 -嘿
- Hey, Pheebs. - Hey.

145
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:15,120
给你，现在我欠你49块半
Here. Now I only owe you 49.50.

146
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,130
菲比…
Hey, Pheebs...

147
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,130
如果你要送乔伊毁掉整栋楼的圣诞礼物
...if you want to get Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building...

148
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,390
何不送更微妙一点的…
...why not get him something more subtle...

149
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:25,770
像是铁锤…
...like a wrecking ball...

150
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,600
或是天花病毒散播在走廊上?
...or a vial of smallpox to release in the hallway?

151
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,710
不只是鼓的声音，每5分钟…
It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes...

152
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,640
乔伊把鼓棒丢到空中…
...Joey throws his sticks in the air...

153
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:38,380
然后我就会听到“我的眼睛，上帝啊，我的眼睛!”
...and I have to hear: "Oh, my eye! Oh, God, my eye!"

154
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:41,180
-烦死人了 -谢谢你
- I mean, it is so annoying. - Yes, thank you.

155
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:45,980
你看，这是正常人对鼓的反应
You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.

156
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:49,920
菲比，你送乔伊鼓是为了烦瑞秋…
Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel...

157
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,660
让她不想继续住在那里?
...so she wouldn't want to live there anymore?

158
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,830
可能有一点
Maybe on some level.

159
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,540
乔伊，你知道你不用丢鼓棒的
Joey, you know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.

160
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,740
那怎么能算是摇滚乐呢?
What is rock 'r roll about that?

161
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,920
乔伊，送你另一个礼物
Hey, Joey, I got you another present.

162
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,690
等一下! 先不要告诉我是什么…
Hold it! Before you tell me what it is...

163
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,720
是什么?
Okay, what is it?

164
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,160
是一只…
It's a...

165
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,700
毒蜘蛛!
...tarantula!

166
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,970
瑞秋，抱歉，我在想什么…
God, Rachel, I'm sorry. What was I thinking...

167
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:38,300
送乔伊这么一个恶心的 可怕的蜘蛛…
...giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider...

168
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,070
还用这么一个松散的笼子?
...in such a poorly constructed cage?

169
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:45,380
你在说什么? 我喜欢它
What are you talking about? I love them.

170
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:51,490
我小时候就有一只 后来我的猫咪吃掉了它
I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it died because my cat ate it.

171
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,390
然后猫咪死了
And then my cat died.

172
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,550
乔伊，这不是很酷吗?
But, Joey, isn't this cool?

173
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,600
在我身上吗? 我觉得它在我身上，我...
Is it on me? I feel like it's on me. I got...

174
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,090
不是很可爱吗?
Oh, isn't that adorable?

175
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,400
乔伊怕蜘蛛
Joey is afraid of the tarantula.

176
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,010
他好可爱哟
He's so adorable.

177
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,400
老天，他很好玩
God, he's just so much fun.

178
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,310
乔伊是最棒的 很高兴你在这里住得很开心
Joey's the best. I'm glad you're having so much fun here.

179
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,740
等一下
Wait a minute.

180
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,140
怎么回事?
What's the matter?

181
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,470
我们的房子好了
Our apartment is ready.

182
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,260
你不高兴因为…?
And that makes you angry because...?

183
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,080
因为你比较想和乔伊住在这里
Because you'd rather live here with Joey.

184
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,020
-你为什么这么想？ -莫妮卡和钱德
- Where did you get that? - Monica and Chandler...

185
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,600
说你和乔伊住得很开心…
...said that you were having so much fun here...

186
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,500
而且不管是鼓还是毒蜘蛛都不会改变这点
...and apparently no amount of drums or tarantula is gonna change that.

187
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,810
菲比，你送乔伊这些东西…
Phoebe, did you get all this stuff for Joey...

188
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:43,140
是要让我不想住在这里?
...to try and drive me out of the apartment?

189
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,740
你还不如送他一条鱼
You might as well have just gotten him a fish.

190
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,280
你知道我有多怕鱼
You know how fish freak me out.

191
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,740
鱼
Fish.

192
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:56,350
这些都不重要，我们会一起住的
But it wouldn't have mattered. You and I are gonna live together.

193
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,050
我们是室友，讲好的
We're roommates. That's the deal.

194
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,890
对，可是我希望你想和我一起住
Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me.

195
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,760
可是如果你在这里住得这么开心…
But, okay, if you're having so much fun over here...

196
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,060
和你在一起更开心…
It's so much more fun with you.

197
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,000
-我们住在一起时很开心，是不？ -对啊，好玩得不得了
- We did have fun, didn't we - We had so much fun.

198
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,690
记得那时我们玩碰撞球的时候
Remember the time we were playing with the SuperBall...

199
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:15,360
球意外地穿过窗户，玻璃烂了
...and we accidentally threw it through the window and it broke?

200
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,870
我记得那扇窗户 但忘了怎么打烂它的
I remember paying for the window, but I don't remember how it broke.

201
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,410
事情就是这样了
Yeah, stuff like that.

202
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,980
他们说如果愿意的话，今晚可以去看
Well, anyway, they say, if we want, we could see it tonight.

203
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,320
-好啊 -好，好!
- I would love to. - Yay, okay!

204
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,460
-好，好 -好
- Good, good, good. - Great. All right. Good.

205
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:35,460
莫妮卡要我停止鼓声
And Monica asked me to make the drumming stop.

206
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,230
好了
Done.

207
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,740
你好，要退还那件裤子吗?
Hello, sir. You here to return those pants?

208
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,380
不，这是我的裤子
No, these are my pants.

209
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,710
好吧
Okay.

210
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:07,890
-需要什么? -还有没有圣诞老人的衣服？
- How can I help you? - Do you have a Santa outfit left?

211
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,290
圣诞节前两天? 抱歉
Two days before Christmas? Sorry, man.

212
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,090
-你去了服装城吗？ -哪都去过了
- Did you try Costume City? - Yeah, I've tried everywhere.

213
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:16,930
-求求你了．我会额外付钱 -对不起，不过…
- Please, please. I mean, I'll pay extra. - Sorry. But...

214
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,540
…26号时就会到货74件
...I do have 74 of them coming back on the 26th.

215
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,940
好吧，有没有什么比较算是圣诞节的?
Okay, look. Do you have anything Christmas-y?

216
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,770
我答应了我儿子，不想让他失望
I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him.

217
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,040
你们一定有的
Come on, you gotta have something.

218
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:35,720
我是佳节犰狳!
I'm the Holiday Armadillo!

219
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,920
我是圣诞老人的朋友…
I'm a friend of Santa's...

220
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,960
他要我来祝你…
...and he sent me here to wish you...

221
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:46,290
圣诞快乐!
...a merry Christmas!

222
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:50,590
圣诞老人怎么了，佳节犰狳?
What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?

223
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,240
圣诞老人没有空…
Santa was unavailable...

224
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,380
在这么接近圣诞节的时候
...so close to Christmas.

225
00:13:58,410 --> 00:13:59,900
请进，请坐
Come in, have a seat.

226
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:04,050
你一定累坏了，大老远从德克萨斯州跑来
You must be exhausted, coming all the way from Texas.

227
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:09,450
-德克萨斯州? -对，班
- Texas? - That's right, Ben.

228
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,420
我是圣诞老人的…
I'm Santa's representative...

229
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:15,490
西南州代表
...for all the Southern states.

230
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,820
还有墨西哥!
And Mexico!

231
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,960
圣诞老人要我来这里…
But Santa sent me here...

232
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,800
送礼物给你
...to give you these presents, Ben.

233
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:29,270
这位小姐可以帮我拿礼物
Maybe the lady will help me with these presents.

234
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,950
谢谢!
Wow, thanks!

235
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,590
不客气，班
You're welcome, Ben.

236
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:50,130
圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas.

237
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:54,300
光明节快乐!
And happy Hanukkah!

238
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:58,860
你也为光明节而来吗? 因为我是一半犹太人
Are you for Hanukkah too? Because I'm part Jewish.

239
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,440
你是? 我也是
You are? Me too.

240
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:08,240
因为犰狳也在沙漠里晃荡? （犹太人逃出埃及后曾在沙漠中挣扎多年才回到故土）
Because armadillos also wandered in the desert?

241
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,450
你想在走廊晃荡吗?
You want to wander in the hall?

242
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,350
班!
Hey, Ben!

243
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,750
佳节犰狳…
What if the Holiday Armadillo...

244
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:21,480
跟你说光之节的故事好吗?
...told you all about the Festival of Lights?

245
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:22,680
酷!
Cool!

246
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,520
来，班
Come on, Ben.

247
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:30,200
很多年以前…
Years and years ago...

248
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,670
有一群人，叫做…
...there were these people called...

249
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:35,000
-玛加伯人! -呵，呵，呵!
...the Maccabees! - Ho, ho, ho!

250
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:38,040
圣诞快乐!
Merry Christmas!

251
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,640
-圣诞老人! -嘿!
- Santa! - Hey!

252
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,280
你来干什么，圣诞老人?
What are you doing here, Santa?

253
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,020
我来看我的老朋友班
Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben.

254
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,420
你在这儿干什么…
What are you doing here...

255
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:57,500
怪乌龟人?
...Weird Turtle Man?

256
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:02,200
我是佳节犰狳…
I'm the Holiday Armadillo...

257
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,730
你的半犹太人朋友
...your part-Jewish friend.

258
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,040
你要我来送礼物给班
You sent me here to give Ben some presents.

259
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,110
记得吗?
Remember?

260
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,540
什么?
What?

261
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,710
圣诞老人，你有带礼物给我吗?
Did you bring me any presents, Santa?

262
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,550
当然有，班
You bet I did, Ben.

263
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,810
放在这里
Put her there.

264
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:34,190
如果不是他的手太小，会成功的
Well, it would have worked this time if his hands weren't so damn small.

265
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:39,360
呵，呵，呵!
Ho, ho, ho!

266
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,510
班，来开礼物好吗
Ben, why don't you come open more presents.

267
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,440
圣诞老人 佳节犰狳和我要在厨房谈一谈
Santa, the armadillo and I will have a talk in the kitchen.

268
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,740
我绝对想不到会说出这句话
There's a sentence I never thought I'd say.

269
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,880
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

270
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,680
你告诉每个人说 你找不到圣诞老人衣服
You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume...

271
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,050
所以我向同事借了一件
...so I borrowed one from a guy at work.

272
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,750
谢谢，你必须离开
Thank you, but you gotta leave.

273
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,420
-为什么? -因为…
- Why? - Because...

274
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:04,430
我终于让他对光明节有兴趣…
...l'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah...

275
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,000
而你正破坏
...and you're wrecking it.

276
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:10,260
可是我还没摇我那装满果冻的肚子呢
But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowlful of jelly.

277
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:17,240
抱歉，钱德，这对我很重要
I'm sorry, Chandler, but this is really important to me.

278
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,510
好，我去还这件衣服
Fine, I'll give the suit back.

279
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,680
你可以再多借一晚吗?
Hey, you think you can keep it another night?

280
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,920
圣诞老人? 真的?
Santa? Really?

281
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,890
是啊，可以吗?
Yeah, is that okay?

282
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:35,760
你爸有扮过圣诞老人吗?
Did your dad ever dress up like Santa?

283
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,300
-没有 -那就可以!
- No. - Then it's okay!

284
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,760
班，圣诞老人要走了
Okay, Ben. Santa has to go.

285
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,490
说再见
Say goodbye.

286
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,300
不要，他为什么要走?
No, why does he have to go?

287
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:52,810
因为圣诞老人和佳节…
Because if Santa and the Holiday...

288
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,940
犰狳…
...Armadillo...

289
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,480
如果在同一个房子里太久…
...are ever in the same room for too long...

290
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,810
宇宙会爆炸!
...the universe will implode!

291
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,790
圣诞快乐!
Merry Christmas!

292
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:12,030
不要，为什么不是犰狳走呢？ 我要圣诞老人
No, why can't the armadillo leave? I want Santa.

293
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,160
好，我放弃，圣诞老人…
Fine, I give up. Santa...

294
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,930
圣诞老人可以留下来!
Santa can stay!

295
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:21,860
我留下来…
Well, I'll stay...

296
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,640
因为我想听光明节的故事
...but only because I want to hear about Hanukkah.

297
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,010
班，你要不要和圣诞老人…
Ben, will you sit here with Santa...

298
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,380
一起坐下来听光明节的故事?
...and learn about Hanukkah?

299
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,680
好的
Okay, Santa.

300
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,210
-谢谢 -不客气
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

301
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,510
好，来听…
All right, it's time...

302
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,020
光明节的故事
...for the story of Hanukkah.

303
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,360
很多年以前…
Years and years ago...

304
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,360
有一群人叫玛加伯人!
...there were these people called the Maccabees!

305
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,030
圣诞快乐!
Merry Christmas!

306
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:04,340
看看这地方!
Oh, wow, look at this place!

307
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,710
真糟糕
Oh, this is terrible.

308
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,350
他们改了很多…
They've made so many changes...

309
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,920
我感受不到我祖母的存在
...I can't even feel my grandmother's presence anymore.

310
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,620
新的烛台!
Oh, new sconces!

311
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,360
我的天! 怎么?
- Oh, my God! - What?

312
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:23,630
记得你告诉我你祖母做了一道墙…
Okay, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall...

313
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,060
-来隔成两间房? -对
...to make that into two bedrooms? - Yeah.

314
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,570
房东可能发现了…
And that the landlord might find out...

315
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,900
-把它拆了? -对
...and then tear it down? - Yeah?

316
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,040
你真的不知道我说这些的原因?
Do you really not know where I'm going with this?

317
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,940
不，当然知道．是什么?
No, of course I do. What?

318
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,410
墙没有了，是一间大房间
It left. It's one huge room.

319
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,680
哦，不!
Oh, no!

320
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,850
哇
Wow!

321
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:49,850
看到了?
See?

322
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,730
我们必须要把墙弄回来
I guess we'll just have to put the wall back up.

323
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:57,230
-不行，因为新的天窗 -有天窗?
- You can't, because of the new skylight. - There's a skylight?

324
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,740
哇
Wow!

325
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,370
我们该怎么办? 要开始找新地方吗
So, what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?

326
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,380
我感到…
You know, I'm sensing...

327
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:12,520
我祖母可能不喜欢那样
...that my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.

328
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,510
是吗?
Oh, yeah?

329
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,380
又能感觉到她了，是吗?
Starting to feel her again there, are we?

330
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,020
-有一点，对 -是
- A little bit. Yeah. - Yeah.

331
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:26,200
菲比，你祖母是不是说你应该一个人住这里?
Pheebs, is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?

332
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,590
你也听见了? 你有天份
You heard it too? You have the gift.

333
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,390
菲比，没关系
Phoebe, it's okay.

334
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,560
我喜欢和乔伊住
I like living with Joey.

335
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:37,270
-你确定吗? -拜托，我讨厌打包…
- Are you sure? - Please. I hate packing...

336
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,880
那里离公司比较近
...it's closer to work.

337
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,050
我们在一起很开心
And we do have fun.

338
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,740
虽然我真的会想念和你住在一起
Although, I'm really gonna miss living with you.

339
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,550
-我也是 -我知道
- Oh, me too. - I know.

340
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,550
等一下，你有没有听到?
Oh, wait. Did you hear that?

341
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,280
听，我听到你祖母说话
Listen. I'm getting something from your grandmother.

342
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:58,190
她说既然你要一个人住这里…
She said that since you get to keep the one-bedroom apartment...

343
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,560
你该把那紫色椅子给瑞秋
...you should give Rachel the purple chair.

344
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,400
没有，我没有听到
No, I do not hear that.

345
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,840
不，等一下．噢，对了
Oh, no, wait a minute. Oh, okay.

346
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:15,140
她没说“椅子”，她说“分享”你要跟别人分享单卧室公寓
She didn't say "chair," she said "share." You should share the one-bedroom apartment.

347
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,840
噢，紫色椅子．是的，我听到了
Oh, the purple chair. No, yeah, I heard that.

348
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:24,010
奇迹在于那一点点的油…
And the miracle was that that little bit of oil...

349
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:28,060
应该只够烧一天的，却烧了…
...that should have lasted just one day, burned for...

350
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,190
-整整8天 -对
- Eight whole days. - That's right.

351
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,330
这就是为什么我们今天庆祝光明节，故事完结
And that's why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.

352
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,470
-好棒 -是啊
- Awesome. - Yeah.

353
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,890
我最喜欢的部份…
My favorite part...

354
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:42,530
是超人救出全埃及的犹太人
...was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.

355
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:50,380
犰狳不是那么喜欢那部份
The armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part.

356
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:56,220
为什么圣诞老人亲莫妮卡姑姑?
Why is Santa kissing Aunt Monica?

357
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:01,260
因为莫妮卡姑姑今年非常非常好
Because Aunt Monica was very, very good this year.

358
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,430
班，该来点…
Okay, Ben, it's time to light...

359
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,600
光明节蜡烛了!
...the Hanukkah candles!

360
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,910
嘿
Hey.

361
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:23,370
哇！ 好像是复活节兔子的葬礼（复活节的一种化妆形象）
Wow! Looks like the Easter Bunny's funeral in here.

362
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:28,780
来，来，我们要点蜡烛
Come on, come on. We're lighting the candles.

363
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,460
我了解为什么超人在这里…
I understand why Superman is here...

364
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:39,220
但为什么有豪猪参加复活节兔子的葬礼?
...but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny's funeral?

365
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:48,930
-你弄好了吗? -弄好了
- Did you get it? - I got it.

366
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,970
它进笼子了没?
Is it back in the cage?

367
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,210
它在笼子里了
It's back in the cage.

368
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:56,240
笼子关好了吗?
Is the cage closed?

369
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:01,820
乔伊，出来好吗? 别像个小孩一样!
Joey, will you just come out here and stop being such a baby!
