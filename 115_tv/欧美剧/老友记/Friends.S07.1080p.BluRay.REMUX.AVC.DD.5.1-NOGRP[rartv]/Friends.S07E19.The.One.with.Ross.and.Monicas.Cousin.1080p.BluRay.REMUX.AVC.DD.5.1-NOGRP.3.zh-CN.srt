1
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:07,500
Oh, hey! How was your audition?

2
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:10,142
I'm sorry, do I know you?

3
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:12,840
What are you doing?

4
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:16,538
Practicing blowing you off.
I'm gonna be a big movie star!

5
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:17,614
You got it?

6
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:21,275
- Not yet, but the audition went great!
- What's it for?

7
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:24,980
A big-budget period movie
about three Italian brothers...

8
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:28,854
...who come to America
at the turn of the century. It's classy.

9
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:32,998
The director's supposed to be
the next-next Martin Scorsese.

10
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:35,960
The "next-next"?

11
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:39,833
A guy from Chicago's supposed to be
the next Martin Scorsese.

12
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:41,938
This guy's right after him.

13
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,143
Hello?

14
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:51,874
Joey, it's Estelle. I just talked to
the casting people. They loved you!

15
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:53,085
They loved me!

16
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,719
They want to see you again tomorrow.

17
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:58,857
- My God!
- There's just one thing.

18
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:02,720
Do you have a problem
with full-frontal nudity?

19
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:08,058
Are you kidding me? I never
rent a movie without it!

20
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:09,967
Oh.

21
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:14,405
Okay, let me call you back.

22
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:18,143
- What's the matter?
- They want me naked in the movie.

23
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:19,504
- Wow!
- I know.

24
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:24,648
- My grandmother's gonna see this.
- Grandma's gonna have to get in line.

25
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:30,379
S07E19 The One With Ross and Monica's Cousin


28
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:05,914
The wedding's so close.
Are you nervous?

29
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,890
Yeah, but I also can't
wait till it's over.

30
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:11,929
We have a pact not to have sex
again until the wedding.

31
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,692
A "no sex" pact, huh?

32
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:18,896
I have one of those with
every woman in America.

33
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:23,933
Will you give me a hand
making up the guest bedroom?

34
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,578
Cousin Cassie's staying with us
for a few days.

35
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:29,976
Cassie? I haven't seen her
in, like, forever.

36
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,017
I wonder if she still carries
a Barbie everywhere?

37
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:35,585
- She's 25 years old.
- So? I still...

38
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,222
You're probably right.

39
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,358
Pheebs, can I talk to you
over here for a second?

40
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,396
Subtle, guys.

41
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:47,757
What?

42
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:51,765
I know you're planning my
surprise bridal shower.

43
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:56,637
Okay, well, don't ruin it.
Just play along, at least.

44
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,674
Okay. Sorry.

45
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:02,205
We have to throw her a shower?

46
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:10,020
What'd you decide to do
about the movie?

47
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:12,121
I don't know. I mean...

48
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:16,627
It's not like it's porn.
This is a serious, legitimate movie.

49
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,127
Nudity's really important
to the story.

50
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,392
That's what you say about porn.

51
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:24,466
Maybe I shouldn't go on the callback.

52
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:28,607
No, you should. A lot of major
actors do nude scenes.

53
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:31,174
The chance to star in a movie?
Come on!

54
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:36,772
That's true. And I'm only naked in
one scene. It sounds really great.

55
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:39,951
My character's Catholic. He falls
in love with a Jewish girl.

56
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:42,654
We run away and get caught
in a big rainstorm.

57
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:46,951
We go into a barn, undress each other
and hold each other.

58
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,253
It's really sweet and tender.

59
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:51,555
Plus, everyone will see your thing!

60
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,292
When can we have this shower?

61
00:03:57,503 --> 00:04:00,597
She has so much going on,
we have only two options.

62
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:03,605
- We have Friday.
- That's just two days away.

63
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,711
- What is the other option?
- Yesterday.

64
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:10,109
If we make it yesterday, we're done!

65
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:12,648
It's impossible.
We can't do this by Friday.

66
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,353
We have to find a place,
invite people, get food.

67
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:16,681
There's too much to do.

68
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:19,790
- We cannot do it!
- Calm down!

69
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,429
Okay. I'm sorry, you're right.
I'm sorry.

70
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,120
Just calm down, woman!

71
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,598
Phoebe, I already did.

72
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:32,100
All right, then I need to calm down.

73
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,303
I think we can do this
if we just get organized.

74
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:40,640
We have two days to plan this party.
We need to make fast decisions.

75
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,781
Where will we have it?

76
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,984
- Here. What time?
- 4:00. Food?

77
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:48,244
- Finger sandwiches and tea.
- Great! Very Monica.

78
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,752
- And chili!
- You went one too far.

79
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,116
- Flowers or balloons?
- Both.

80
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,328
- We're paying for this.
- Neither.

81
00:04:57,497 --> 00:05:01,695
- What should we do for a theme?
- Lusts of the Flesh!

82
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,363
- What?
- I don't know. Cowboy theme?

83
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:14,969
I'm glad we decided not to sleep
together before the wedding.

84
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,145
Oh, boy. Me too.

85
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:22,981
I was thinking, say we had a big fight,
and broke up for a few hours.

86
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,057
Technically, we could have sex again.

87
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,859
What do you think,
bossy and domineering?

88
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,657
The wedding's off,
sloppy and immature.

89
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,127
That's me. Come on.

90
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:37,564
Wait. Cassie's in the guest room.
We're going to lunch.

91
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,829
Get rid of her, obsessive and shrill!

92
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,206
Shrill? The wedding is back on.

93
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:48,505
I thought I heard voices.
You must be Chandler.

94
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:52,049
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

95
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:54,116
- So, ready to go?
- Yeah.

96
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,499
- Chandler?
- I'll be right with you.

97
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,311
- Cassie needs to stay at your place.
- Why?

98
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:23,276
Because "Pervie Perverson" here
can't stop staring at her.

99
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,540
Chandler, she's our cousin!

100
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:28,618
I wasrt staring.
I was listening intently.

101
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:32,120
It's called being a good
conversationalist. Watch.

102
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:33,686
Say something.

103
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,927
You were staring about eight inches
south of there.

104
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:40,395
Fine. She can stay at my place.

105
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,659
What does Cassie look like now?

106
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,461
Exactly like Aunt Marilyn.

107
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,305
This Aunt Marilyn,
is she coming to the wedding?

108
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,372
Wafer-thin ice.

109
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:56,749
Hey, I'm back.

110
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,679
Hi, Joey.

111
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:01,183
Will I read the same scene again?

112
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:04,356
I tried to call you.
You didn't need to come today.

113
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,115
Oh, great.

114
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,391
I'd have been perfect for this part.

115
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,860
You made a bad decision and
ruined your movie. Good day!

116
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:17,762
You didn't need to come, because the
director saw your tape and loved it.

117
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:22,107
And, scene.

118
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:28,540
Wasrt that fun? We did
a little improv there. Yeah!

119
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,306
So, you were saying?

120
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:34,077
The director wants to meet you
tomorrow.

121
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,251
Wow! Sure! That's great.

122
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,650
Your agent said you're okay
with nudity.

123
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,793
Yeah, sure. As long as
it's handled tastefully.

124
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:44,292
And that barn is not too cold.

125
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,864
Perfect. There's one more thing.

126
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:55,601
It's important to the director that
everything in the movie's authentic.

127
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,969
In your love scene with Sarah...

128
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:02,375
...she talks about how she's never
seen a naked man who wasrt Jewish.

129
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:03,708
So...

130
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:07,913
So... what?

131
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,750
So, the director is insisting
that whoever play that part...

132
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,588
...be authentically, anatomically...

133
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:19,322
...not Jewish.
You know what I'm saying?

134
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:20,965
Yes!

135
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:22,762
No. What?

136
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:29,467
An Italian Catholic immigrant
at this time would not be...

137
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:30,902
Bar mitzvah-ed?

138
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:37,279
Think 13 years earlier, lose the rabbi,
add a scalpel.

139
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:48,652
- To get this part, you can't be...
- No.

140
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:49,759
But you are?

141
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:52,362
- You told them you werert?
- That's right.

142
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:54,390
Wow!

143
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:58,998
It's definitely all gone?
There's nothing there to work with?

144
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,943
- What were you thinking?
- I don't know. I just want this part.

145
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:10,081
They say no matter what you're asked
during an audition, say yes.

146
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:12,809
They want you to ride a horse,
say you can.

147
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,044
You figure out how to do it later.

148
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:21,151
This is not like learning to ride
a horse. This is like learning...

149
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,294
...to grow a turtleneck.

150
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:34,231
I know, okay? Tomorrow,
when I go meet the director...

151
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,637
...I have to take my clothes off so
they can see what my body looks like.

152
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,368
Oh, my God. What are you gonna do?

153
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,347
I have to call my agent
and tell her I can't do the part.

154
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,215
Unless...

155
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:49,887
Unless what?

156
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:54,185
This may sound crazy, but there may
be something we could...

157
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:55,485
...fashion.

158
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:02,366
- Like what?
- Well, I'm not sure yet.

159
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,966
Off the top of my head,
I'm thinking...

160
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:09,369
...double-sided tape
and some sort of luncheon meat.

161
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:19,478
I've got a great idea for party
favors for the shower.

162
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:23,348
We get mahogany boxes
and carve everyone's names in them.

163
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:27,117
Then inside is each persors
individual birthstone.

164
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:30,987
Okay. Okay.

165
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,600
You take care of that.

166
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:40,169
Meanwhile, the party's tomorrow
and we don't have a guest list.

167
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:44,707
Okay. Who do we know that's coming?
Me. Are you?

168
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,472
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

169
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:52,947
I'm making something for Joey.
Can I raid your fridge?

170
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:54,717
Have at it.

171
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:59,857
All right. Turkey? That won't work.

172
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,357
Cheese? That won't work.

173
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:05,960
Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.

174
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,528
Are you making him a sandwich?

175
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:13,133
No, it's more like a wrap.

176
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:17,633
Okay, so I'm gonna go, guys.

177
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:22,177
So you can get back to deciding on
what to get me for a present!

178
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,475
We have to get her a present?

179
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,179
Okay, but look. Look at what I got.

180
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,518
It's her address book.
We have a guest list.

181
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:39,425
You're amazing. Did you pull
that out of her purse?

182
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:43,090
Uh-huh. And a little seed money
for the party.

183
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:52,973
Cassie?

184
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,045
Hey, Ross!

185
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,646
It's been so long!

186
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:00,950
Last time I saw you...

187
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:04,714
...you were setting up your tent
in line for Return of the Jedi.

188
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:06,152
That's right.

189
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:10,658
So you did see me that day.
Because it seemed like you didn't.

190
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:15,364
- Yeah, sorry about that.
- It's okay. Come on in.

191
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:19,401
Thanks for letting me stay here.
Monica's place was nice.

192
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:22,870
But her fiance sure stares a lot.

193
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:47,290
Oh, my God! You do a great Chandler!

194
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,601
I have a knack for impressions.

195
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,831
Maybe after we get re-acquainted
you could do me.

196
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:58,304
Yeah. No!

197
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,780
How you doing on that...

198
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,388
...hot dog?

199
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,359
- I'm all done.
- Thank God.

200
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:23,660
The last time we hung out was when
our parents rented that beach house.

201
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:28,566
Remember the time I pinned you down
and tickled you until you cried?

202
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:33,201
We're probably too old to do that now.

203
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:39,975
I'll always remember that summer.
It's when I got all these freckles.

204
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:45,416
I'll always remember that summer...

205
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:49,185
...because that's when I realized
that we are related.

206
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,927
You know, we're not just
two random people thrown together.

207
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:56,498
We share genetic material.

208
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:58,767
It took you that long
to figure it out?

209
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:00,795
I'm a little slow.

210
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,572
Just as our children would be.

211
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,042
- Hi.
- Hi.

212
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:16,254
How are you? Good. Hi.
Thanks for coming.

213
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,752
Thank you. So nice to see you.

214
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,688
- No, thanks.
- Okay. Hey, Rach?

215
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:24,226
- Yeah?
- Who the hell are all these people?

216
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,831
I don't know.
I called everybody in her book.

217
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:31,730
These are the ones that could
show up on 24 hours' notice.

218
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:34,997
There's a word for people like that:
Losers.

219
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:39,876
Hi, I'm Rachel. This is Phoebe.
I'm the maid of honor.

220
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,571
- How do you know Monica?
- I was her accountant four years ago.

221
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:48,583
I'm interested to find out who's been
doing her taxes the last four years.

222
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:51,078
That's great.

223
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:56,053
- When is Monica supposed to get here?
- I don't know.

224
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:58,657
Excuse us.

225
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:03,534
- You didn't tell her?
- You were supposed to.

226
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:07,365
You were supposed to tell her to come!
I was bringing the cake!

227
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:11,434
- Fine, I'll go call her.
- And please tell her to bring a cake!

228
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:22,178
We have a lot of options. A number
of prototypes for you to try on.

229
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:24,953
Those look great.

230
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:28,991
Okay, this one's a mushroom cap.
This one is made of bologna.

231
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,822
- The toothpicks?
- Just until the glue dries.

232
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:33,157
Thank God.

233
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,529
These are more realistic,
but perishable.

234
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:41,397
Over here, we have pink suede,
which is nice.

235
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,007
But if it gets wet, it'll shrink.

236
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,575
Maybe we'll just
take that one away.

237
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:52,276
I also did a little something in fur,
but that's really just for me.

238
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:59,180
Why don't you try these on? We'll
get a better idea of what works.

239
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:02,792
Thanks, you are such a good friend.
And this is so weird.

240
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:11,726
Okay, the taffy's too sticky.

241
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:13,834
I was afraid of that.

242
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,470
- Toothpick?
- Yeah.

243
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,577
- What are you trying now?
- The Fruit Roll-up.

244
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:22,644
- And?
- Delicious.

245
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:28,412
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
We have a winner!

246
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,917
What? Which one?

247
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:34,387
The Silly Putty.
Not so silly anymore!

248
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:48,339
She's your cousin.
She's your cousin.

249
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:54,206
If she knew what was going on in
your head, she'd think you were sick.

250
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:04,011
Or would she?
Let's back up for a second.

251
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:08,751
She was the one who suggested
opening a bottle of wine.

252
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:11,794
She was the one who
turned down the lights.

253
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:15,558
She was the one that wanted to rent
Logars Run...

254
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:18,566
...the sexiest movie ever.

255
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,805
I know that look.

256
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:28,139
Forget it. I want it. She wants it.

257
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:29,813
I'm going in.

258
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:40,882
What the hell are you doing?

259
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:44,592
Say something clever.

260
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,762
Okay, doesn't have to be clever.

261
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:52,630
Just has to be words. Say some words.

262
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:56,431
Any words will do.

263
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,643
Oh, my God, this is the longest...

264
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:05,078
...that anyone has not talked ever!

265
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:09,413
There is nothing you could say
to make this worse...

266
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:12,590
...so just say something!

267
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,189
I haven't had sex in a very long time.

268
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:24,495
Yeah, you really shouldn't
have said anything.

269
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,267
Phoebe? Rachel? It's Monica.

270
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:33,502
I wonder what you could possibly
need me for on such short notice?

271
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:41,612
- Oh, Monica. We are so sorry.
- For what?

272
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:45,381
First, for forgetting to
throw you a bridal shower.

273
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:47,989
Then, forgetting to invite you to it.

274
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:51,693
You already had it?

275
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:55,298
We called everyone in your phone book.
A bunch of people came.

276
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:59,267
It took us so long to get you here
that they had to leave.

277
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:03,464
We wanted to throw you a big surprise
and a great shower.

278
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,506
Now you don't have either.

279
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,076
We ruined everything.

280
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:11,773
No, wait a minute, that's not true.
What you did was really sweet.

281
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:15,351
- It kind of works out for the best.
- What do you mean?

282
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:19,820
Now I get to spend my shower
with the only people I really love.

283
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:24,722
I get all those presents without
talking to people I don't even like!

284
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,303
- Surprise.
- Surprise, Monica.

285
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:42,071
What's cool is, the character
is from Naples, right?

286
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,612
My whole family's from Naples.

287
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:49,651
That's great. Okay. I've heard
everything I need to hear...

288
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:52,185
We just need to, uh...

289
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:53,756
Leslie?

290
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:58,386
- Joey, this is the awkward part.
- Hey, right. Not a problem.

291
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:00,792
I totally understand you need...

292
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:04,901
...to make sure I don't have any
horrible scars or tattoos.

293
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:06,263
Don't you worry.

294
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:09,271
I have nothing to hide.

295
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:13,338
So, there you go. That's me.

296
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:15,773
One hundred percent natural.

297
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:34,165
I tell you, that has never
happened before.

298
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:42,136
Cassie, are you finding
everything okay?

299
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:45,003
Yeah. Thanks for
letting me stay here.

300
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,235
Oh, it's no problem.

301
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:05,628
What?

302
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:08,597
Say something. Say anything.

303
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,592
Ask her out! She's not your cousin!
