00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:12,229
瑞秋，别这样
Rach, come on.

4
00:00:12,263 --> 00:00:14,231
是你的生日耶！
It's your birthday!

5
00:00:14,265 --> 00:00:16,256
嘿…
Hey....

6
00:00:17,301 --> 00:00:21,260
她不像她29岁时那么漂亮
She's not as pretty as she was when she was 29.

7
00:00:21,305 --> 00:00:25,264
在葛林小姐出来之前 她要先把几件事说清楚
Ms. Green wants to estabIish some ground ruIes before she comes out.

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,279
她希望你们不要用到如“老” 或者“走下坡”等字眼…
She'd appreciate it if you didn't use the words ''oId'' or ''downhiII'' ...

9
00:00:29,313 --> 00:00:32,282
或是“它们看来还是很棒”
...or ''They stiII Iook pretty damn good.''

10
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:39,256
它们还是
They do.

11
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,258
瑞秋，出来
RacheI, come on out.

12
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:43,260
摩妮卡做了早餐
Monica made breakfast.

13
00:00:43,294 --> 00:00:45,262
巧克力碎片松饼
ChocoIate chip pancakes.

14
00:00:45,296 --> 00:00:49,289
我们有礼物给你
We've got presents.

15
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,301
好的礼物？
Good ones?

16
00:00:52,336 --> 00:00:56,295
都是两星期前你给的单子上的
They aII came from the Iist you handed out to us two weeks ago.

17
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,309
我可以只收礼物，而仍然是29岁吗？
Can I keep the presents and stiII be 29?

18
00:00:59,343 --> 00:01:03,279
瑞秋，30岁没什么大不了
Come on, Rach, turning 30 is not that big a deaI.

19
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:06,283
真的？你满30岁也是这么觉得吗？
ReaIIy? Is that how you feIt when you turned 30?

20
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:09,286
为什么，上帝，为什么？
Why, God, why?

21
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,313
我们讲好的了，让其他人变老，我不要！
We had a deaI. Let the others grow oId, not me!

22
00:01:22,366 --> 00:01:26,325
要知道，在关岛我还是29岁
You know, I'm stiII 29 in Guam.

23
00:01:27,371 --> 00:01:30,340
嘿，30岁也不是很老嘛
Hey, 30 is not that oId.

24
00:01:30,374 --> 00:01:34,333
知道地球有多老吗？
Do you know how oId the Earth is?

25
00:01:34,378 --> 00:01:36,369
30好几了？
Late 30s?

26
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:39,316
只有我这样吗？是我反应过度吗？
You guys, is it just me? Am I overreacting?

27
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,343
不，不是只有你，我的30岁生日也不好过
No, it's not just you. My 30th birthday sure wasn't much fun.

28
00:01:44,355 --> 00:01:46,346
现在是钱德了！
And now ChandIer!

29
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:50,327
我们都变得这么老
We're aII getting so oId.

30
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:53,353
你为什么这样对我们？
Why are you doing this to us?

31
00:01:57,401 --> 00:01:59,369
六人行 步入三十大关

33
00:02:32,436 --> 00:02:34,404
（瑞秋30岁生日快乐）

34
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,398
你的生活过得很好 你有很棒的工作，很好的朋友
You're in a great pIace in your Iife. You have an amazing job, good friends.

35
00:02:39,443 --> 00:02:42,412
你的室友是连续剧明星
Your roommate's a soap opera star.

36
00:02:42,446 --> 00:02:46,382
你的角色在昏迷中
Your character is in a coma.

37
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:50,376
我答应自己这个生日一定不哭
I promised myseIf I wasn't gonna cry at this one.

38
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:54,380
我知道我目前过得很好，但我看到一些人…
I know my Iife's going pretty weII, but I see so many peopIe...

39
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:58,384
在30岁以前就完成了他们的目标
...who've accompIished their goaIs before they're 30.

40
00:02:58,429 --> 00:03:02,422
是啊，你不应该和我比
Yeah, but you shouIdn't compare yourseIf to me.

41
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:05,435
来，菲比！你做得到的！
-Come on, Phoebe! -You can do it!

42
00:03:05,469 --> 00:03:07,437
来好了
-Come on. -There you go.

43
00:03:13,477 --> 00:03:17,413
我成功了！我在跳跳球上走了一哩
I did it! One miIe on a Hippity Hop.

44
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:20,417
30岁前我想完成的事
That's everything I wanted to do before I was 30.

45
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:23,420
除了我想和我妹修好关系
Except I wanted to patch things up with my sister.

46
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:25,445
嗯，可是
Oh, weII. But, yeah!

47
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:31,451
女人，这东西是上帝给的礼物 如果你懂我的意思
GirIs, this thing is a godsend, if you know what I mean.

48
00:03:41,505 --> 00:03:44,474
30岁.喔，我是说，30岁
Thirty. Oh, I mean, 30.

49
00:03:44,508 --> 00:03:48,501
摩妮卡，还记得5年级刻薄的老女人 克雷格老师吗？她当时也就是30岁
Monica, you remember mean, oId Mrs. Kreiger in fifth grade? She was 30.

50
00:03:49,513 --> 00:03:52,448
来做点有趣的事吧，你想做什么？
Let's have some fun. What do you want to do?

51
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:54,451
什么也不做，我什么也不想做
Nothing. I don't want to do anything.

52
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:58,478
在30岁生日时什么都不做 总比做笨事好，像罗斯一样
Doing nothing on your 30th is better than doing something stupid, Iike Ross.

53
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:02,459
那是很实际的一项购买
That was a practicaI purchase.

54
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:05,462
我需要那车子做交通工具
I needed that car for transportation.

55
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:08,488
好吗？我有小孩
Okay? I have a chiId.

56
00:04:08,532 --> 00:04:12,491
我在这车里看来很拉风吧？
How hot do I Iook in this?

57
00:04:12,536 --> 00:04:14,504
罗斯，一台跑车？
Ross, a sports car?

58
00:04:14,538 --> 00:04:18,497
在裤子里塞袜子不是比较便宜
WouIdn't it be cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?

59
00:04:18,542 --> 00:04:20,510
这不是为了那个
That's not what this is about.

60
00:04:20,544 --> 00:04:23,479
我是跑车热爱者
I am a sports car enthusiast.

61
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:27,473
我一直都很喜欢车 它的马力多少？
-I've aIways been into cars. -What's the horsepower?

62
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:31,511
不知道，你看它多亮呀！
I don't know, but Iook how shiny!

63
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:36,516
真不敢相信你居然买了 真的，天啊，罗斯，你是怎么想的？
-I can't beIieve you bought this. -ReaIIy. God, Ross, what were you thinking?

64
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:40,497
我知道有点浅薄，但我有点再次想要他了
I know it's reaIIy shaIIow, but part of me wants him again.

65
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:44,524
那就行动吧，小姐
WeII, get in Iine, missy.

66
00:04:44,568 --> 00:04:46,536
帅哥，载我一程吧？
So can I have a ride, stud?

67
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,538
跳上车
Hop in.

68
00:04:49,573 --> 00:04:53,566
准备好你这辈子最稳的一程
Get ready for the smoothest ride of your Iife.

69
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,568
可恶
Damn it.

70
00:05:20,604 --> 00:05:24,563
好了，下一个是谁？
Okay, who's next?

71
00:05:25,609 --> 00:05:29,545
今天我一定要做点什么 我不要像老太太一样闲坐在这儿
I am gonna do something today. I'm not just gonna sit around Iike some oId Iady.

72
00:05:29,613 --> 00:05:32,548
我要在身上打个洞
I want to get something pierced.

73
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,552
像是鼻子，舌头，或是别的地方
Like my nose or my tongue or something.

74
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:37,554
真的，那会很痛的
ReaIIy? Because that hurts.

75
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:39,556
那又怎么样？我是这么想…
So what? The way I see it--

76
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,581
该死的！
Son of a bitch!

77
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:45,562
我知道你经历的
Look, I know what you're going through.

78
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:48,588
我25岁生日时吓坏了
I'm totaIIy freaked out about turning 25.

79
00:05:52,636 --> 00:05:54,604
离开我家
Get out of my apartment.

80
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:58,608
瑞秋，你做的很好
Rach, I think that you're doing great.

81
00:05:58,642 --> 00:06:01,611
正视事实吧，没有人能真的好好处理这件事
Let's face it, no one handIes this weII.

82
00:06:01,645 --> 00:06:04,580
至少你不行
Least of aII you.

83
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:08,608
为什么，你怎么了？你不是要走吗，伙计？
-Why, what did you do? -Weren't you asked to Ieave, sonny?

84
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:16,593
放回去，摩妮卡随时会到家
Put that back on. Monica wiII be here any minute.

85
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:20,620
可是乔伊的苹果会痛
But it hurts my Joey's appIe.

86
00:06:21,665 --> 00:06:25,624
告诉你最后一次 它不是以每一个人的名字命名的
For the Iast time, it's not named after each individuaI man.

87
00:06:30,674 --> 00:06:34,633
钱德，你把宴会办得真好 每样东西都很美丽
You've done a wonderfuI job with this party, ChandIer. Everything's so IoveIy.

88
00:06:34,678 --> 00:06:36,612
没有像你这么美丽
WeII, not as IoveIy as you.

89
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:39,616
不能相信你有位30岁的女儿
I can't beIieve you have a 30-year-oId daughter.

90
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:43,643
不能相信你有件30岁的燕尾服
And I can't beIieve you have a tux that's 30 years oId.

91
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:48,648
这比30年还老 罗斯是在这件燕尾服旁有的
It's oIder than that. Ross was actuaIIy conceived right near this tuxedo.

92
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:54,654
大家躲起来！我看到她了，她来了
Everybody hide! I saw her. She's coming.

93
00:06:54,698 --> 00:06:56,666
大家蹲下！
Everybody down!

94
00:06:58,336 --> 00:06:59,894
Crap.

95
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:08,701
留在这儿，我来看看发生什么事了
Everybody stay here. I'II find out what's going on.

96
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:12,672
嘿，你开门了
Hey, you got the door open!

97
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:16,653
嘿，你喝醉了吗？
Hey, are you drunk?

98
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,678
没有
No.

99
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:22,682
好
Okay.

100
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:27,687
好
Okay.

101
00:07:28,732 --> 00:07:31,701
我对要满30岁…
See, I was a IittIe nervous about turning...

102
00:07:32,736 --> 00:07:34,704
有点紧张
...30.

103
00:07:34,738 --> 00:07:38,697
收碗的小弟带我去喝酒
So the busboys took me out for some drinks.

104
00:07:40,744 --> 00:07:43,713
待会可能会吐在你身上
Might want to puke on you Iater.

105
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:49,709
事情是这样的 我们替你办了一个惊喜宴会
Here's the thing. We've thrown a very formaI surprise party for you.

106
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:53,690
你的朋友和父母都在里面不！
-Your friends are in there, and your parents. -No!

107
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:54,691
是的！是的！不
-Yes! Yes! -No.

108
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:58,684
哦，不！我父母从没看我醉过
Oh, no! My parents have never seen me drunk.

109
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:00,697
就他们所知
That they know of.

110
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:04,724
我们替你弄点咖啡，他们不会知道你醉了
We'II get you some coffee. They'II never know that you're drunk.

111
00:08:04,768 --> 00:08:07,737
你确定？我会处理好的
-You promise? -I'II take care of it.

112
00:08:07,771 --> 00:08:09,739
我好爱你
I Iove you so much.

113
00:08:10,774 --> 00:08:14,733
好了，要对你的口臭想想办法
Okay, we have to do something about your breath.

114
00:08:14,778 --> 00:08:16,746
那你的呢？
What about your breath?

115
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:22,708
那还是你的口臭
That's stiII yours.

116
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:24,721
记住，这是一个惊喜
Now remember, it's a surprise party.

117
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:28,714
你进去时要显得很惊讶
So when you go in, act surprised.

118
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,750
好了吗？
Ready?

119
00:08:37,801 --> 00:08:39,769
惊喜！
Surprise!

120
00:08:44,808 --> 00:08:46,776
好，前进，前进
Okay, forward. Forward.

121
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,801
停止！
Stop!

122
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,771
好，退后，停
Okay, back-- Stop!

123
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:54,751
好，前…停！
Okay, for-- Stop!

124
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:56,753
停！停！
Stop! Stop!

125
00:08:56,787 --> 00:09:00,746
罗斯，忘记它吧，他不舍得下来了
Ross, just forget about it. The guy's got you totaIIy wedged in.

126
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:04,784
这是你的吗？ 不，是我的！是我的
-Is this yours? -No, it's mine! It's mine.

127
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:11,791
兄弟，你真需要这辆车
Dude, you so need this car.

128
00:09:12,836 --> 00:09:14,804
好，我们这么做
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

129
00:09:14,838 --> 00:09:17,807
我打开这台休旅车车门，将它放在空档
I'II break into this minivan, put it in neutraI.

130
00:09:17,841 --> 00:09:21,800
你们把它向前推，罗斯就能开出来了
You push it forward so Ross can drive out of the spot.

131
00:09:21,845 --> 00:09:23,813
好，来吧
AII right. Here we go.

132
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,811
快逃！
HauI ass!

133
00:09:42,866 --> 00:09:45,835
30岁生日快乐！来
Happy 30th birthday! Here.

134
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:50,829
给你里面的孩子，还有女子
It's for the chiId in you. And the woman.

135
00:09:50,874 --> 00:09:51,841
30岁快乐！
Happy 30th!

136
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,843
你为什么一直这么说？
Right. Why do you keep saying that?

137
00:09:53,877 --> 00:09:55,845
因为这是我们的30岁生日
Because it's our 30th birthday.

138
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:59,838
不，我们不是30，我们31岁了
Yeah, no, we're not 30. We're 31 . Okay.

139
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:02,842
等一下
Wait.

140
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:05,822
哦，是你
Oh, it's you.

141
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:07,824
是，怎么？
Yeah. What?

142
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:11,817
对，我们不是30，我们是31
Yeah, we're not 30. We're 31 .

143
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:13,830
我的出生证明上是这么写的
That's what it says on my birth certificate.

144
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:15,855
你有出生证明？
You have a birth certificate?

145
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:19,858
我妈去世时，我拿到了一箱子家庭文件
I got a big box of famiIy stuff when my mom died.

146
00:10:19,903 --> 00:10:20,870
我们的妈
Our mom.

147
00:10:20,904 --> 00:10:22,872
好，好
Right. Okay.

148
00:10:23,907 --> 00:10:27,900
你有我的吗？ 没有，我卖给了一个逃家的瑞典人
-Do you have mine? -No, I soId it to a Swedish runaway.

149
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:32,849
我的老天
Oh, my God.

150
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:35,852
我的老天，我们31了
Oh, my God, we are 31 !

151
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:37,854
是啊
Yeah.

152
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:40,857
我失去了整整一年生命
I just Iost a whoIe year of my Iife.

153
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:42,882
好
Okay.

154
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:46,863
你的纪念名字是潘蜜拉？ 对
-Your middIe name is PameIa? -Yes.

155
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:49,889
我从不知道我的是什么，你记得是什么吗？
I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is?

156
00:10:49,933 --> 00:10:52,902
记得，是菲比
Yes. Phoebe.

157
00:10:52,936 --> 00:10:56,895
那是我的正式名字对，好吧，那我不知道
-That's my first name. -Right. Okay. Then, no.

158
00:11:00,944 --> 00:11:03,879
我们成功地穿过了客厅，你做的很好
We made it across the room. You're doing great.

159
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:04,881
怎么回事？
What's going on?

160
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:06,883
摩妮卡有一点醉了
Monica's a IittIe drunk.

161
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:10,876
我喜欢酒醉的摩妮卡
Yeah! I Iove drunk Monica.

162
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:14,914
她比正常的摩妮卡有趣多了
Oh, she's so much more fun than reguIar Monica.

163
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:19,896
她不想让她的父母知道
She doesn't want her parents to know.

164
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,922
好，好，我们这么做
AII right, aII right. Here's what we'II do.

165
00:11:22,966 --> 00:11:26,925
我来比她醉得厉害两倍 就没有人会注意她了
I'II get twice as drunk, then no one wiII even notice her.

166
00:11:28,972 --> 00:11:32,965
不能让菲比醉好的，你看我的吧
-Drunk Phoebe's mean. -Okay, you watch your tone with me!

167
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:38,915
怎么了？
What's going on?

168
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:40,917
摩妮卡醉了
Monica's wasted.

169
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:43,920
或许能让这个宴会有点生机
Maybe that wiII Iiven up this party.

170
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:46,923
你能不能帮她换衣服？
WiII you just heIp her get changed?

171
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:50,950
照顾酒醉，裸体的女人，好像是乔伊的工作
Taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems Iike a job for Joey.

172
00:11:54,998 --> 00:11:56,966
这是我的礼物
This one's from me.

173
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,959
这不是你的礼物单上，不过它真的很好玩
It wasn't on your Iist, but it's reaIIy fun.

174
00:12:02,005 --> 00:12:04,974
滑板车
A scooter.

175
00:12:05,008 --> 00:12:06,999
照着单子买
Stick to the Iist.

176
00:12:09,012 --> 00:12:11,947
永远记得照着单子买
AIways stick to the Iist.

177
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:15,941
不，不，我很喜欢，谢谢

178
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:15,918
No, no, I Iove it. Thank you.

179
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:17,954
下一个开我们的礼物！下一个开我们的！
Open ours next! Open ours next!

180
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:20,957
你们现在是一对，我们就没两个礼物了？
Now that you're a coupIe, we don't get two gifts?

181
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:24,950
我上一个生日，你送我一个拥抱
For my Iast birthday, you gave me a hug.

182
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:27,987
念卡片！念卡片！
Read the card! Read the card!

183
00:12:31,034 --> 00:12:33,002
“生日快乐”祖母
''Happy birthday, Grandma.

184
00:12:35,038 --> 00:12:38,007
开始走下坡总比…
It's better to be over the hiII...

185
00:12:39,042 --> 00:12:43,001
被埋在坡下要好
...than buried under it.

186
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:46,983
我们爱你，摩妮卡和钱德好好笑
AII our Iove, Monica and ChandIer.'' That's funny.

187
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:49,986
不，不，只是一个玩笑
No, no. That was a joke.

188
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,989
我知道，我懂了，很好笑
I know, I get it. It's funny.

189
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:54,991
因为你不是祖母
Because you're not a grandma.

190
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:58,984
做为一个祖母，必须结了婚有小孩
To be a grandma, you have to be married and have chiIdren.

191
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:03,022
我全都没有，所以真的很好笑
I don't have any of those things. That's why it's so funny.

192
00:13:04,067 --> 00:13:06,035
我要…
I'm just gonna go....

193
00:13:10,073 --> 00:13:14,066
你只需要买张卡片而已
AII you had to do was buy the card.

194
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:22,007
看看谁回来了.是我们的寿星女
Hey, Iook who's back. It's the birthday girI.

195
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:26,045
寿星女感觉如何？
How's the birthday girI feeIing?

196
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:31,050
很好，不过你吓跑了其他孩子
WeII, I feeI fine, but I think you're bumming out the rest of the kids.

197
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:38,057
为没有先生和小孩就不高兴，是很蠢的
It was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids.

198
00:13:38,101 --> 00:13:41,070
我只需要一个计划
AII I reaIIy needed was a pIan.

199
00:13:41,104 --> 00:13:43,072
我想生三个小孩
See, I want three kids.

200
00:13:43,106 --> 00:13:47,099
你要全部同一个时候生把他们给你弟弟
And you want to have them aII at the same time and have them for your brother.

201
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,048
我正在说…
As I was saying....

202
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:55,051
我应该在35岁以前生第一个
I shouId have the first one by the time I'm 35.

203
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:59,044
这样我还有五年
Which gives me five years.

204
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:01,057
我喜欢这个计划.我要和这个计划结婚
I Iove this pIan. I'm gonna marry this pIan.

205
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:05,050
如果你可以的话，我就和嬉皮乐手结婚
If you couId do that, I'd marry the Hippity Hop.

206
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:09,088
如果我35时要生孩子，我34岁时才需要怀孕
If I want a kid when I'm 35, I don't have to get pregnant untiI I'm 34.

207
00:14:09,132 --> 00:14:13,091
PRADA还有四年时间生产孕妇装
Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity cIothes.

208
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:20,098
我想在怀孕之前至少结婚一年
But I want to be married for a year before I get pregnant.

209
00:14:20,143 --> 00:14:24,102
真的？要那么久？
ReaIIy? That Iong?

210
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:31,110
你爱怎么看都行，已经在发生了
Look aII you want, it's happening.

211
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:36,115
我到33岁再结婚就好，我还有3年
I don't have to get married untiI I'm 33. That's three whoIe years.

212
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:38,094
不过，等一下
Wait a minute, though.

213
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:42,121
我需要一年半来筹备婚礼
I'II need a year and a haIf to pIan the wedding.

214
00:14:42,165 --> 00:14:45,134
我希望能认识这个人一年至一年半…
And I'd Iike to know the guy for a year, year and a haIf...

215
00:14:45,168 --> 00:14:47,136
再订婚
...before we get engaged.

216
00:14:49,172 --> 00:14:53,165
这表示我必须在30岁时认识这个人
Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm 30.

217
00:14:54,177 --> 00:14:58,113
没有问题，因为你才刚满…
Which is fine because you just turned...

218
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:00,139
28！
...28!

219
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:03,119
不，罗斯，不，有问题
No, Ross. No, it is not fine.

220
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:07,146
我应该和我要嫁的对象在一起了
I shouId aIready be with the guy I'm gonna marry.

221
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:18,157
你可不可以不要跳？
WiII you quit hogging it?

222
00:15:21,204 --> 00:15:25,163
我告诉你，这就好像看着斑比学走路
I'm teIIing you, it's Iike watching Bambi Iearn how to waIk.

223
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:28,200
你醉了
You're drunk.

224
00:15:29,212 --> 00:15:33,171
爹妈和妈会生气
Mom and Dad are gonna be mad.

225
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:37,176
也许我有一点醉了
Maybe I'm a IittIe drunk.

226
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:40,156
那是蟹饼吗？
Are those crab cakes?

227
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:44,183
我不是告诉你，蟹饼一出来立刻拿来给我？
Did I not teII you to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?

228
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:49,188
觉得怎么样？
How you feeIing?

229
00:15:49,232 --> 00:15:51,200
你好帅
You are so handsome.

230
00:15:53,236 --> 00:15:57,195
我想在此时此地和你上床
I want to make Iove to you right here, right now.

231
00:15:59,242 --> 00:16:02,234
我希望你不会
I reaIIy wish that you wouIdn't.

232
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:12,211
再撑一下，我们就可以带你去睡觉
Just get through a IittIe bit more, then we can put you in bed.

233
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:17,182
只要微笑，不要说话
Just smiIe and don't taIk to anyone.

234
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:21,220
演讲，演讲！寿星演讲
Speech, speech! Let's hear from the birthday girI.

235
00:16:22,265 --> 00:16:23,232
菲比！
Pheebs!

236
00:16:23,266 --> 00:16:26,235
看，大家都在看我
See, everybody's Iooking at me.

237
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:28,237
我的计划很有效
The pIan's working.

238
00:16:28,271 --> 00:16:32,230
我还没脱掉上衣呢
I didn't even have to take off my top yet.

239
00:16:32,275 --> 00:16:34,266
演讲，演讲！
Speech. Come on, speech!

240
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:41,206
你连离开她一秒 钟都不行
You can't keep your hands off her for one second.

241
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:43,219
很好啊
I think it's nice.

242
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:45,244
我必须这样
I think it's necessary.

243
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:56,255
我要谢谢大家来到这里
I want to thank you aII for coming.

244
00:16:56,299 --> 00:16:58,267
我的家人和…
My famiIy and...

245
00:16:58,301 --> 00:17:00,269
我的朋友
...my friends.

246
00:17:03,306 --> 00:17:05,274
我很想说我…
I'd reaIIy Iike to say that I'm....

247
00:17:08,311 --> 00:17:11,246
知道我真的很想说什么吗？
You know what I'd reaIIy Iike to say?

248
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:13,272
我醉了！
I'm drunk!

249
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:18,254
没错，爸，妈
That's right, Mom and Dad.

250
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:21,280
你们的小口琴醉了
Your IittIe Harmomica is hammered.

251
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:25,261
猜猜怎么着？
And guess what?

252
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:28,264
我以前也喝醉过
I've been drunk before.

253
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:30,289
我抽过烟
And I've smoked a cigarette.

254
00:17:31,334 --> 00:17:35,293
我在内衣抽屉里藏了一盒叮当
And I've had a box of Ding Dongs hidden in my underwear drawer.

255
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,309
没关系，没关系，因为…
It's aII okay. It's okay because...

256
00:17:40,343 --> 00:17:43,278
我今天满30岁了
...I turned 30 today.

257
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:46,282
我想做什么就做什么
And I can do anything I want.

258
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:49,308
因为我是成年人了
Because I am a grownup.

259
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:57,316
好，好，替我脱掉
Okay, quick. HeIp me get this off.

260
00:18:01,364 --> 00:18:03,332
我失去了整整一年
I Iost a whoIe year.

261
00:18:03,366 --> 00:18:06,335
我不能相信，真不公平！
I can't beIieve it. This is so unfair!

262
00:18:06,369 --> 00:18:08,337
菲比，没有关系的
Come on, Pheebs, it'II be okay.

263
00:18:08,371 --> 00:18:10,339
是吗？是吗？
WiII it? WiII it?

264
00:18:11,374 --> 00:18:14,343
如果你发现你变31岁了，你会有什么感觉？
How wouId you feeI if you found out you were 31 ?

265
00:18:14,377 --> 00:18:18,336
不会的，因为我们有个新约定
That's not gonna happen. Because we have a new deaI.

266
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:21,317
还有，这毁了我的时间表
PIus, it ruined my scheduIe.

267
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:25,344
我还没做那些我31岁前想做的事
I haven't done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31 .

268
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:30,315
像什么？像是我还不认识任何葡萄牙人
-Like what? -Like I haven't met any Portuguese peopIe.

269
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,329
我还没有完美地接吻过
I haven't had the perfect kiss.

270
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:37,356
我还没去上狙击手学校
And I haven't been to sniper schooI.

271
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,359
我们去吃蛋糕吧
Why don't we go and have some birthday cake.

272
00:18:41,404 --> 00:18:45,363
我只想一个人静一下，待会见，谢谢
I just feeI Iike being by myseIf for a whiIe. See you guys Iater. Thanks.

273
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,378
可怜的菲比
Poor Pheebs.

274
00:18:49,412 --> 00:18:53,371
嘿，你知道吗？我想我要陪她走回家
Hey, you know what, you guys? I think I'm gonna waIk her home.

275
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:59,355
老天什么？
-Oh, man. -What?

276
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:01,380
他会吃了蛋糕
He's gonna eat the cake.

277
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:04,360
菲比！
Pheebs!

278
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:06,362
听着，我…
Listen, I....

279
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,387
闭上眼睛
CIose your eyes.

280
00:19:20,443 --> 00:19:24,402
你可以将这一项从单子上划掉
That's one thing you can cross off your Iist.

281
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:27,406
哦，对
Oh, yeah.

282
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:33,412
还有，我是16分之一的葡萄牙人
PIus, I'm one-sixteenth Portuguese.

283
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,394
好，大家都清楚了？
Okay, is everybody cIear?

284
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:41,420
我们要将它抬起来…
We're gonna pick it up...

285
00:19:42,465 --> 00:19:44,433
然后移动它
...and move it.

286
00:19:45,468 --> 00:19:49,427
只需要团队工作，我们要抬起这台车…
AII we need is teamwork. We're gonna Iift the car...

287
00:19:50,473 --> 00:19:52,441
把它滑出来
...and sIide it out.

288
00:19:55,478 --> 00:19:57,412
抬起来…
Lift...

289
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:59,415
滑出来
...and sIide.

290
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:03,408
罗斯，我真的不觉得这… 抬起来…
-Ross, I reaIIy don't think this-- -Lift...

291
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:05,421
滑出来
...and sIide.

292
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:09,448
好，开始吧好，大伙儿
AII right. Come on, dogs, Iet's Iift this sucker.

293
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:14,430
除非你害怕了.小人儿害怕了？
Oh, unIess you're scared. LittIe weakIings scared?

294
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:16,455
很好的团体合作
Good teamwork.

295
00:20:16,499 --> 00:20:20,458
好吧，开始 好的，大家一起来
-Okay, here we go. -AII right, everyone.

296
00:20:20,503 --> 00:20:22,471
抬起来…
Lift...

297
00:20:25,508 --> 00:20:27,499
移出来
...and sIide.

298
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:35,474
嘿，乔伊…别这样，瑞秋，才刚轮到我
-Hey, Joey-- -Come on, Rach, my turn just started.

299
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:39,455
其实我是要和泰格说话
ActuaIIy, I just want to taIk to Tag.

300
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:42,458
哦，好，我可以到外面溜吗？
Oh, okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?

301
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:45,461
随便，我不是你妈
Whatever. I'm not your mother.

302
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:47,486
不要到街上！
Not in the street!

303
00:20:50,533 --> 00:20:54,492
有没有觉得好一点？有，我很好，我…
-Are you feeIing any better? -Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm....

304
00:20:55,538 --> 00:20:57,506
我们谈谈

305
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,437
Let's taIk.

306
00:20:59,542 --> 00:21:01,510
什么事？
What's up?

307
00:21:01,544 --> 00:21:03,512
泰格…
Oh, Tag....

308
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:08,473
你真是个好男人，我们在一起很开心
You're such a great guy. And we have so much fun together.

309
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:10,486
可是我..等一下
-But I-- -Wait.

310
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,488
我想我知道你要做什么
I think I see where you're going.

311
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:16,515
在你说任何话之前，我可以先说一件事吗？
But before you say anything eIse, can I say one more thing?

312
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:26,535
说的好
WeII said.

313
00:21:28,571 --> 00:21:32,530
正是我所谓很开心的好例子
And a good exampIe of the fun I was referring to.

314
00:21:33,576 --> 00:21:37,535
但是我想我已经过了只要开心的时候
But I think I'm past the point where I can just have fun.

315
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:42,507
瑞秋，不要这样，这只是因为你30岁了
RacheI, don't do this. This is just because you're turning 30.

316
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:44,520
是的
Yeah, it is.

317
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:48,513
而你只是个孩子，你才25岁
But you're just a kid. I mean, you're 25.

318
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:51,550
其实是24岁老天
-Twenty-four, actuaIIy. -Oh, God.

319
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:57,556
你知道我希望什么？我希望你比现在大6岁
You know what I wish? I wish you were six years oIder.

320
00:21:58,601 --> 00:22:02,560
如果是希望的话，其实我希望自己年轻6岁
WeII, if I'm wishing for stuff, I actuaIIy wish I was six years younger.

321
00:22:03,606 --> 00:22:07,599
我也是是啊，对不起
-Me too. -Yeah. Sorry.

322
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:18,554
嘿，谈得怎么样？
Hey, how'd it go?

323
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:22,581
如果我只要生两个孩子 我可以再保留他一年吗？
If I onIy want two kids, can I keep him for another year?

324
00:22:24,594 --> 00:22:26,585
你做的对
You did the right thing.

325
00:22:30,633 --> 00:22:33,602
我不喜欢它了
I don't Iike this anymore.

326
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,633
我们在这儿，一群30岁的人
WeII, here we are. Just a bunch of 30-year-oIds.

327
00:22:42,645 --> 00:22:46,604
你知道再过10年，我们就40岁了？
Do you reaIize in 1 0 years we're gonna be 40?

328
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,588
为什么，上帝？
Why, God?

329
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:56,615
为什么这么对我们？
Why are you doing this to us?

330
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:05,624
太好了！我的宝贝终于自由了
Yes! My baby's finaIIy free.

331
00:23:05,668 --> 00:23:07,636
好极了！
AII right!

332
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:09,638
启动，我们走
Start it up. Let's go!

333
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:19,638
我们拉不拉风？
How hot are we?

334
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:29,648
你要买车吗？
You want to buy a car?
