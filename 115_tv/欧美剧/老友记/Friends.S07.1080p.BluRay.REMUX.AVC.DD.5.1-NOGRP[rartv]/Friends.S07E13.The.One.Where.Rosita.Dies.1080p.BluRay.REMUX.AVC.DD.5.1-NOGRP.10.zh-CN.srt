1
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:06,138
嘿嘿
-Hey. -Hi.

2
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:10,165
你在做什么？我想把沙发搬开
-What are you doing? -I was thinking of moving the couch.

3
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:12,144
你为什么要那么做？
Why wouId you want to do that?

4
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:16,137
那样子我就有好位置可以坐了？
So there'd be a decent pIace for me to sit?

5
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:20,175
瑞秋，你本来就有好位置坐 你的大腿不算
-Rach, there is a decent pIace. -And your Iap does not count.

6
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:25,191
来吧，帮我把它搬开 不
-Come on, heIp me move this. -No, no, no.

7
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:27,193
你不要 我不要
-No? -No.

8
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:30,196
罗希塔不想移开
Rosita does not move.

9
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:34,200
对不起，罗希塔，它是…？
I'm sorry. Rosita? As in--?

10
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:37,169
就是“不想动的罗希塔”
As in ''Rosita does not move.''

11
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,171
它只是一张椅子，它有什么大不了的？
It's just a chair. What's the big deaI?

12
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:42,174
它到浴室跟到厨房的距离是一样的…
It's the exact equaI distance from the bathroom to the kitchen...

13
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:46,201
而且它的角度让你 完全看不到史提夫的闪光
...and it's at an angIe where you don't get any gIare coming off Stevie.

14
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,205
电视机史提夫？
Stevie the TV?

15
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:55,210
有问题吗？没有
-Is there a probIem? -No.

16
00:00:58,258 --> 00:00:59,225
他又知道什么？
What does he know?

17
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:03,218
来吧，罗希塔，我们这些辣妹得合作才行
Come on, Rosita. Us chicas gotta stick together.

18
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,228
你这个臭女人！
You bitch!

19
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,233
六人行 罗希塔之死

21
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,268
（中央公园咖啡厅）

22
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,248
你知道什么是奇怪吗？
Hey, you know what's weird?

23
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:59,251
等你们结婚了 你们向别人介绍我的时候…
After you guys get married, when you introduce me to peopIe...

24
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:03,278
…你得说，“这是我大舅子，罗斯”
...you're gonna have to say, ''This is my brother-in-Iaw, Ross.''

25
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:06,292
而不是“我的朋友，罗斯”，是“大舅子，罗斯”
Not ''my friend, Ross,'' ''brother-in-Iaw, Ross.''

26
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:08,294
很奇怪，对吗？
That's weird, isn't it?

27
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:10,296
难道我不能说，“这是罗斯”吗？
CouIdn't I just say, ''This is Ross''?

28
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,321
可以，随你便！
Sure, do whatever you want.

29
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:15,301
嘿，罗斯？
Hey, Ross?

30
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:18,270
我看过房地产广告版
I checked the reaI estate section.

31
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,272
你看这个
Look at this.

32
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,274
看起来好像爸妈的房子
Looks Iike Mom and Dad's house.

33
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:26,267
院子里的树，正前方也有根断掉的树枝
Even has a tree with a broken Iimb out front.

34
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:30,271
阁楼的窗户…
And the window in the attic....

35
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,284
喔，我的天啊！
Oh, my God!

36
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,311
阁楼的窗户怎么了？
What happened to the window in the attic?

37
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:40,315
我不敢相信他们要把它卖掉 却没有告诉我们
-I can't beIieve they're seIIing it. -And they didn't teII us.

38
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,319
阁楼的窗户怎么了？
What happened to the window in the attic?

39
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:48,357
爸爸吗？摩妮卡和我 刚刚在报纸上看到房子的事
HeIIo, Dad? Monica and I just saw the house in the paper.

40
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:54,306
是的，我们吃了一惊
Yes, we're surprised.

41
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,308
你告诉谁了？
Who did you Ieave a message with?

42
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,333
对不起！
Sorry!

43
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,316
乔伊，真是对不起
Joey, Joey, I'm so sorry.

44
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,343
跟你说过不要动它！ 你会什么感觉如果，我是说…
I toId you not to move it! How wouId you feeI if, say...

45
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:10,356
我要搬动你妈妈，好吧…
...I wanted to move your mom, okay...

46
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,359
…你说，“别”，但我还是那样做了…
...and you said, ''Don't,'' and I did it anyway...

47
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:16,362
…接着她的头掉了？
...and her head feII off?

48
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,364
我会买张新椅子赔你，好吗？
I'II buy you a new one, okay?

49
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:22,391
我们马上到店里去帮你买一张新椅子
We'II go to the store and get you a new chair right now.

50
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,363
她还尸骨未寒
She's not even coId yet.

51
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,345
罗希塔不希望你继续过你的日子吗？
WouIdn't Rosita have wanted you to move on?

52
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:37,372
我是说她永远把你的幸福放在第一位
I mean, you know, she did aIways put your comfort first.

53
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,376
没错
That's true.

54
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:48,383
好吧，你准备好了吗？ 好了
-Okay, you ready? -Yeah.

55
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:52,421
我不想斯蒂维看到她这样
I don't want Stevie to see her Iike this.

56
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:57,369
我不敢相信，我们得跟小时候的家说再见
I can't beIieve we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in.

57
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:01,362
天啊，有个陌生人就要搬进我的房间里
Man, some stranger's gonna be in my room.

58
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,376
十五年来，他们把你房间弄得跟神龛差不多
For 1 5 years they kept it as a shrine to you.

59
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,379
现在一切都该落幕了
It's time the veIvet ropes came down.

60
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,381
他们也保留你房间有一阵子
They kept your room a whiIe.

61
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:13,408
拜托，我搬出来二十分 钟后 爸就把我的房间变成健身房
PIease! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out.

62
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:18,413
我很怀疑，一张日光浴椅 跟一堆维多利亚秘密的目录？
I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria's Secret cataIogs?

63
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,427
那不是健身房
Not a gym.

64
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:24,430
别这样，你知道他们爱你 就跟他们爱你一样
-Come on. You know they Iove you. -As much as they Iove you?

65
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:28,457
我没出生前，他们以为她不会生 那不是我的错
They thought she was barren untiI I was born. It's not my fauIt.

66
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,407
我讨厌今年
I hate this year.

67
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,409
今年有什么不对的？
What's wrong with this year?

68
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:40,412
现在已经是二月，我只接到两个按摩客人…
It's February and I've onIy given two massages...

69
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,415
而且他们给小费都给得很吝啬
...and they were both horribIe tippers.

70
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:47,408
你是指我跟罗斯
That was me and Ross.

71
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,444
喔，没错
Oh, that's right.

72
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,458
如果你需要钱…
If you want some extra cash...

73
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:56,451
我大学的朋友做电话行销赚了不少钱
...some coIIege friends made good money doing teIemarketing.

74
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:59,465
好主意，你打电话很在行
That's a great idea. You're reaIIy good on the phone.

75
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:02,434
他一定比上次我做的电话行销工作还棒
It'd be better than the Iast teIephone job I had.

76
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:06,461
或许我不必常常说“打我屁股吧”
I probabIy won't have to say ''spank'' as much.

77
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,443
什么？
What?

78
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:15,470
对，你从来没打过那种电话
Oh, yeah, Iike you never caIIed.

79
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:23,478
真的很简单，你只要照着稿子念…
This is very easy. You read from the script...

80
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:26,492
试着多卖一点碳粉
...and try to seII as much toner as you can.

81
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,494
好吧，我办得到
Okay, I can do that.

82
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:32,487
对了，我喜欢我的办公室
By the way, I Iove my office.

83
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:36,468
我们为什么不来练习一下？好吧
-Why don't we do a triaI run? -Oh, okay.

84
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,470
好了
AII right.

85
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:41,473
嗨，我是帝国办公室文具公司的菲比
Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office SuppIies.

86
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:45,466
请问总务部经理在吗？我就是总务部经理
-Can I speak to your suppIy manager? -I'm the suppIy manager.

87
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,480
我想跟你谈谈买碳粉的事
I'd Iike to taIk about your toner needs.

88
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,481
我们不需要碳粉
We don't need any.

89
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,484
好吧，抱歉打扰你了，再见
Okay, sorry to bother you. Bye-bye.

90
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,509
你说的对，这真的很容易
Yeah, you're right. This is easy.

91
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:57,523
好吧，那通电话哪里不对劲呢？
Okay. What was wrong with that caII?

92
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:59,525
好吧
Oh, weII, aII right.

93
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:03,518
我没有恶意，但你的态度真的很不好
No offense, but you were kind of rude.

94
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:07,533
他们永远都会说，他们不需要碳粉，没关系
They aIways say they don't need toner. That's okay.

95
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:11,526
不管他们说什么 你都会在稿子里找到标准解答
Whatever they say, you can find the answer to it, here in the script.

96
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,506
我想你准备好要卖碳粉了
So I think you're ready to seII toner.

97
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,509
你还有问题吗？ 没有了
-Do you have any Iast questions? -No.

98
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,511
等一下，对了，我的确有一个问题
Wait, yes, I do have one question:

99
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,536
什么是碳粉？
What is toner?

100
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,541
乔伊？
Joey?

101
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,544
乔伊？
Joe?

102
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,561
原封未动？
FuII bag?

103
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,589
啤酒还是冰的
Beer's stiII coId.

104
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:45,560
这里一定发生了很可怕的事
Something terribIe must have happened here.

105
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,569
喔，不…
Oh, no, no, no!

106
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:01,576
史提夫，我没来过这里
Stevie, I was never here.

107
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,593
爸？ 我在这里！
-Dad? -I'm here!

108
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:09,595
嗨 嗨
-Hey. -Hi.

109
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:13,622
感觉上好像以前你们 跑来这里看我工作的时候
Seems Iike just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.

110
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,568
我们不敢相信你们要卖掉房子
We can't beIieve you're seIIing the house.

111
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,570
也该让新的家庭在这里开始他们的新生活了
Time for a new famiIy to start here.

112
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,573
我希望在支票兑现前他们不会发现…
I hope their check cIears before they find the crack...

113
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:25,600
地基有裂痕，天花板的石棉瓦破了
...in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiIing.

114
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:30,571
我们快把东西拿一拿，离开这里吧
Let's grab our stuff and get the heII out of here.

115
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:34,575
抱歉我们不能收藏你们的东西没关系
-Sorry we can't store your things. -Oh, it's okay.

116
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,611
我等不及要再看到那些东西了
I can't wait to see everything again.

117
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:38,624
我不知道这里放了什么
I don't know what's down here.

118
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:42,617
但阁楼上有六七箱简易烘焙烤箱
But there are six or seven Easy-Bake Ovens in the attic.

119
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,631
我以前最喜欢玩开餐厅的游戏了
I used to Iove to pIay restaurant.

120
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:49,624
但你最爱的还是“吃面粉糊”
Not as much as you Ioved to pIay ''uncooked batter eater.''

121
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:54,629
你不能要求小孩子等着电灯泡把饼干烤好
You can't expect a chiId to wait for a Iight buIb to cook brownies.

122
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,610
我想你的箱子应该都在这里
So I think your boxes are over here.

123
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,612
太棒了
Oh, great.

124
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,614
嘿…
Hey...

125
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,639
这是谁的烟？
...whose cigarettes are these?

126
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,643
我不知道
I don't know.

127
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:10,656
一定是你妈的
They must be your mother's.

128
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:15,650
但求求你别去质问她，我来把烟丢掉
But pIease, pIease don't ask her. I'II throw these away.

129

133
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:43,678
噢，看，你的旧化妆盒

135
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:53,722
不过白色好像不能碰
But the white seems to be untouched.

136
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,672
惨了 怎么了？
-Uh-oh. -What?

137
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,674
你知道每年春天车库都会淹水吗？
You know how the garage fIoods every spring?

138
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:06,667
你要怎么把房子卖掉？
How are you ever gonna seII this pIace?

139
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,681
我想我不小心把摩妮卡的箱子…
I think I accidentaIIy used Monica's boxes...

140
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:13,708
来挡水，免得保时捷进了水
...to keep the water away from the Porsche.

141
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,723

144
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:28,723
爸，她一定会崩溃的
Dad, she's gonna be crushed.

145
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:32,704
你该不会是偷偷在抽烟吧？
You don't secretIy smoke, do you?

146
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,705
不
No.

147
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,731
是你妈在抽烟
So it's just your mother then.

148
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,744

00:09:56,796 --> 00:10:00,755
嗨，厄尔，我是帝国办公室文具公司的菲比
Hi, EarI. This is Phoebe from Empire Office SuppIies.

152
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,735
我想跟你谈谈买碳粉的事
I'd Iike to taIk to you about your toner needs.

153
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,760
我不需要碳粉
I don't need any toner.

154
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:11,766
我知道，但是听了我们的价格 大家都会想买碳粉
I hear what you're saying, but at our prices, everyone needs toner.

155
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,746
我不要
Not me.

156
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,748
能请问你为什么吗？
May I ask why?

157
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:20,741
你想知道为什么？
You want to know why?

158
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:21,775
你想知道为什么？
You want to know why?

159
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:23,789
我真的很想
I sureIy do.

160
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:26,792
好吧
Okay.

161
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,794
我不需要碳粉…
I don't need any toner...

162
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:32,821
因为我就要自杀了
...because I'm gonna kiII myseIf.

163
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:47,768
那是因为你的碳粉用完了吗？
Is that because you're out of toner?

164
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:51,806
好吧，今天我不需要碳粉，谢谢，再见
Okay, so no toner today. Thanks anyway. Bye-bye.

165
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:56,811
等一下！我不能让你挂电话，请你跟我说话
Wait, wait! I can't Iet you hang up. Just pIease taIk to me.

166
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:58,824

00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,827
今天我只需要做一件
I onIy had one thing to do today.

168
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,829
（今天的工作，自杀）

169
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,833
我猜我能把它延期一下吧
I guess I couId push it back.

170
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:11,803
好吧，你为什么要自杀？
Yeah. Now, why do you want to kiII yourseIf?

171
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,806
十年来，我一直在做…
I've been working for 1 0 years now at this...

172
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,809
这份没有意义没有前途的工作…
...meaningIess, dead-end job...

173
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:21,836
办公室里的人根本不知道我的存在
...and nobody here even knows that I exist.

174
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,839
钱德？
ChandIer?

175
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,856
你说什么？
I'm sorry?

176
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:33,859
听着…
Look...

177
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:36,862
我相信他们都知道你的存在
...I'm sure that peopIe know you exist.

178
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,864
是吗？我在一个小房间工作…
Oh, yeah? I work in a cubicle...

179
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,866
四周都是人
...surrounded by peopIe.

180
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,836
我已经跟你谈了五分 钟我要自杀的问题…
I've been taIking to you for five minutes now about kiIIing myseIf...

181
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,829
没有人抬头来看我一眼，等一下
...and no one's even Iooked up from their desk. Hang on.

182
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:49,841
嘿，大伙们…
Hey, everybody...

183
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,866
我要自杀了
...I'm gonna kiII myseIf.

184
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,870
回头跟你们说
I'II get back to you.

185
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,875
没人理我
I got nothing.

186
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,888
等会
Wait.

187
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,890
嘿，马奇
Hey, Marge.

188
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,922
他们不理我
Nothing. Nothing.

189
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:19,871
好漂亮的椅子
Good chair.

190
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,873
好了，如果有人问起…
Now, if anybody asks...

191
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:25,900
你的名字就叫罗希塔
...your name is Rosita.

192
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:45,954
乔伊，我给你买了一张新椅子 商店里最贵的椅子
Come on, Joey. I just bought you a new chair, the most expensive one in the store.

193
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:50,902
知道我在想什么吗？给她取名弗朗塞特
You know what I was thinking? We couId name her Francette.

194
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,904
弗朗塞特？
Francette?

195
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,929
她是谁，沙发？
What is she, a couch?

196
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:04,939
可怜的小东西，她是英年早逝
Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.

197
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,942
乔伊，新椅子一小时内就会送来
Joey, the new chair wiII be here in an hour.

198
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:10,956
或许我们该把罗希塔搬出去
Maybe we shouId move Rosita out of here.

199
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,959
开始疗伤止痛
Start the heaIing process.

200
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,962
好吧，我猜你说的对
Yeah, I guess you're right.

201
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:19,965
也许我要带她去焚化炉
Maybe I'II take her down to the incinerator.

202
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,967
真伤心
It's gonna be so sad.

203
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,969
也有点酷
And kind of cooI.

204
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,992
她好了！
She's heaIed!

205
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,999
那太奇怪了 不，一点都不奇怪
-That's weird. -No, it's not weird.

206
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,001
这是奇迹！
It's a miracIe!

207
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,971
这不是奇迹，我相信这一定有合理的解释
It's not a miracIe. I'm sure there's an expIanation.

208
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:03,998
没错，只要你的心地纯正，奇迹一定会发生
There is. If your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen.

209
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:11,972
我没… 你能告诉我怎么回事吗？
-I don't-- -Can you teII me how this happened?

210
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,008
不 奇迹
-WeII, no. -MiracIe.

211
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:20,014
可能有人进来修好它.或者其他什么的
No, you know what, maybe somebody came in here and fixed it. Or something.

212
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,027
天使？
Someone Iike an angeI?

213
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:30,024
没错，乔伊.椅子天使进来修好了你的椅子
That's right, Joey. The chair angeI came in and heaIed your chair.

214
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:37,031
拿走你那还没送过来的椅子！
Get your non-beIiever ass out of my chair!

215
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:51,045
她会了解的，我不是故意的
She'II understand. I didn't do it on purpose.

216
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:51,046
Dad, that won't matter to her.

217
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:54,059
爸，对她来说那并不重要
Look, aII my stuff is safe and dry.

218
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:56,061
你看，我的箱子完全没事
And aII her stuff is...

219
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,063
她的东西都…
...growing new stuff.

220
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:01,066
长出新的东西了
This is the kind of thing...

221
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,034
就是这样的事
...that makes her think you Iove me more than her.

222
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:06,037
让她认为你们爱我更胜于爱她
My God. Does she think that?

223
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,039
天啊，她真的那么认为？
-Can you bIame her? -I don't know.

224
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,041
你能怪她吗？我不知道
We may have favored you unconsciousIy. You were a marveI.

225
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:14,034
或许我们在潜意识上是偏爱你的 你是个奇迹

226
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:15,611
-The doctors said your mom couIdn't-- -I don't want to hear it.

227
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,038
医生说你妈没办法…我不想听

228
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:18,442
-ReaIIy? -WeII, not right now.

229
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,052
真的吗？现在不想
Monica came here for some memories. Damn it, we'II give her some.

230
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:25,079
摩妮卡来这里找回忆 该死，我们得给她一些回忆

231
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:25,250
Okay, grab....

232
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,092
好吧，拿…
Grab some boxes. We'II take stuff from mine...

233
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:31,085
把空箱子拿过来，我们拿一些我的东西…

234
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:33,093
...and whatever we can pass off as hers, we'II put in there.

235
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:35,123
放在这些箱子里，只要能骗过她就行

236
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:36,934
-Like, this. She couId have made this. -Sure.

237
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:39,070
譬如说这个，这可能是她做的 没错
And this, she couId have won this.

238
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:43,063
这可能是她的 当然
-This couId have been hers. -Sure.

239
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:46,077
这个是什么？ 你的化妆盒？
-Here, what about this? -Your makeup kit?

240
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:49,103
我感觉好多了
I'd feeI better.

241
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:56,110
我好高兴我能把这张椅子留下来给自己用
I am so psyched I kept this chair for myseIf.

242
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,127
对，我也是
Yeah. Me too.

243
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:09,157
嘿，奇迹椅子怎么样？ 很好
-Hey, how's the miracIe chair? -Fine.

244
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:14,128
你知道这张椅子的头垫上还附了喇叭吗？
You know, this thing has speakers in the headrest?

245
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,108
不，真的吗？没错
-No, reaIIy? -Yeah.

246
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:21,135
你可以把它跟电视机 接在一起还可以听收音机
You can hook it to the TV and you get radio.

247
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:29,143
我的椅子有自疗的功能
My chair heaIs itseIf.

248
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:35,149
艾尔，你没听我讲话 我是说，你不孤单.好吗？
EarI, you're not hearing me. AII I'm saying is, you're not aIone, aII right?

249
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:39,187
所有人都讨厌他们的同事
Everybody hates the peopIe they work with.

250
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,169
嘿，伙计
Hey, guy.

251
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,138
等一下，那人好像对你挺好
Wait, that sounded Iike someone being nice to you.

252
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:51,131
不，只是说句“嘿，伙计”的家伙
No, that's just the ''hey, guy'' guy.

253
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:55,135
他对所有人都那样说.他最坏了
He says that to everybody. He's the worst.

254
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,171
我要干掉他
I'd Iike to take him with me.

255
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,152
好吧，我们别提办公室的同事了，好吗？
AII right. Let's just forget about the peopIe at the office, okay?

256
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:05,179
一定有人值得你留恋
There's gotta be someone worth sticking around for.

257
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:09,183
你的家人跟朋友呢？或许你有女朋友？
What about family or friends? Maybe a girlfriend?

258
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,196

喔，抱歉，你的男朋友呢？
Oh, sorry. Boyfriend?

260
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:18,169
天哪 不，随便吧，什么都行
-Oh, God. -No, whatever. Anything.

261
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,194
嘿，伙计
Hey, guy.

262
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,199
没错，他要走了
Yeah, he's gotta go.

263
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,178
好了，我应该…
Okay, I shouId...

264
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:30,181
去做我想做的事了
...be getting back to my thing now.

265
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,183
再见
See you.

266
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:35,209
我还没有说完，你休想挂我电话！
I'm not finished! Don't you dare hang up on me!

267
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:39,213
新来的女同事真的有一套
The new girI's good.

268
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,227
嘿，伙计们
Hey, guys.

269
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:46,254
我定了一些点心.3天内应该准备好了
I just whipped us up some Easy-Bake treats. They shouId be ready in about three days.

270
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:51,202
太好了！听到了吗，罗斯？3天！
That's a good one! You hear that, Ross? Three days!

271
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,205
噢，美好的回忆 好的
-Oh, this'II make a great memory. -Okay.

272
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,207
哪些箱子是我的？
Which boxes are mine?

273
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,210
你的箱子在这里好吧
-These are yours right here. -Okay.

274
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,212
着色簿
A coIoring book.

275
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,214
你喜欢那个玩意
You Ioved that thing.

276
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,239
你去哪里都会…
You never went anywhere without...

277
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,219
都会带着那本着色簿
...without that coIoring book.

278
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,244
真的吗？
ReaIIy?

279
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,257
看起来我老是没办法把颜色涂在线上
Looks Iike I had troubIe staying in the Iines.

280
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,259
不
Nuh-uh!

281
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:20,265
旧手套？ 你以前很喜欢它
-An oId gIove? -Yeah, you Ioved that gIove.

282
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:24,258
去哪里都戴着.没有它你哪都不去
You took it every pIace you went. You never went anypIace without the gIove.

283
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,237
哇，你看这个
Wow, Iook at this.

284
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,239
我不敢相信以前我穿得下这件T恤
I can't beIieve I even fit into this shirt.

285
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,264
（暴龙罗斯）

286
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,246
喔，这是你的
Oh, this is yours.

287
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,249
我不知道它怎么会跑到那里去
I don't know how that got in there.

288
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:41,252
这不是我的东西
This isn't mine.

289
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,277
嘿，这些不是我的东西
Hey, this isn't my stuff.

290
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:47,281
罗斯，这些是你的箱子
Ross, these are your boxes.

291
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:54,288
我的箱子在哪里？
Where are my boxes?

292
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,267
你的箱子…
Your boxes are....

293
00:18:56,301 --> 00:19:00,260
怎么了？ 爸爸？
-What? -Dad?

294
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:04,298
车库淹水，甜心，你的箱子都进了水，对不起
The garage fIooded, sweetie, and ruined your boxes. I'm sorry.

295
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,277
只有我的箱子进水了？
Just mine?

296
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,279
恐怕是那样的
I'm afraid so.

297
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:12,272
为什么罗斯的东西都没坏？
Why wasn't Ross' stuff ruined?

298
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:16,310
如果你说那是“医学奇迹” 我要蒸掉你的头
And if you say the words ''medicaI marveI,'' I'm going to Easy-Bake your head.

299
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:22,316
我用你的箱子挡水来保护我的保时捷
I used your boxes to divert water away from the Porsche.

300
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:25,330
罗斯的东西都没事 但我的回忆都没有了…
Ross' stuff is fine, but I have no memories...

301
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:28,333
只为了你不希望你的汽车底盘碰到水？
...so you couId keep the bottom of your car from water?

302
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:32,326
水里有树叶，泥巴跟杂物
There was aIso Ieaves and gook and stuff.

303
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,330
我不敢相信！
I can't beIieve this!

304
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:46,340
去他的，我要抽根烟
Screw it. I'm having one.

305
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,358
嘿，钱德嘿
-Hey, ChandIer. -Hey.

306
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:57,351
你要不要试试看一张可以平躺…
How'd you Iike to sit in a chair that recIines...

307
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:59,364
有滚轮按摩功能…
...has a roIIing massage...

308
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,366
头垫还附了喇叭的椅子？
...and speakers in the headrest?

309
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,335
我试过很多次…
I've tried that so many times...

310
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:08,328
但他们已经不再让我走进他们店里
...they won't even Iet me in the store anymore.

311
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:12,332
如果我说你可以到我家试坐一下呢？
What if I said you couId do it in my apartment?

312
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,344
你是说…
Are you teIIing me...

313
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:17,337
你买了那张让其他椅子都变成废物的椅子？
...you bought the chair that makes aII others obsoIete?

314
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:21,375
那张《椅子杂志》封为 “年度最佳椅子”的椅子？
The chair that Sit Magazine caIIed ''Chair of the Year''?

315
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,390
我刚刚买了…
I just purchased...

316
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:29,383
懒男孩E倾斜3000型
...the La-Z-Boy E-CIiner 3000.

317
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:32,397
喔，那真的是太棒了！ 太帅了！你为什么买下它？
WeII, that's awesome! That's great! What made you do it?

318
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:35,400
说来话长，但我弄坏了乔伊的椅子…
It's a Iong story, but, I broke Joey's chair--

319
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:38,369
哇…你弄坏了乔伊的椅子？
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You broke Joey's chair?

320
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:42,396
我以为是我干的 所以我用我的椅子跟它调包
I thought I did, that's why I repIaced it with mine.

321
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,377
所以它才会完全没事
That's how it got fixed!

322
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,380
你以为是妖精把它修好的？
You thought that eIves came in and fixed it?

323
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,382
不
No.

324
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,407
是天使干的
AngeIs.

325
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:58,412
我要把我的椅子拿回来
I'm getting my chair back.

326
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:03,417
喔，看起来它根本没有自疗功能！
WeII, Iooks Iike it wasn't heaIed after aII!

327
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:08,456
我猜这张椅子是我的了
I guess this chair's mine now.

328
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,402
乔伊，你弄坏了我的椅子！
Joey, you broke my chair!

329
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:12,403
你的椅子？
Your chair?

330
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:15,406
他以为他把它弄坏了所以他调换了椅子
He thought he broke it, so he switched chairs.

331
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,408
奇迹根本不存在？
So there was no miracIe?

332
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,411
没错，乔伊，奇迹不存在
No, Joe. No miracIe.

333
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,414
喔，不，这真的是太糟糕了
Oh, no! This is devastating!

334
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:27,441
我的信念被击垮了 我很高兴这张新椅子能陪我走过这一切
My faith is shaken. I'm gIad I have a new chair to get me through this.

335
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:32,457
不错的尝试.但你不会再拥有那张椅子了
Nice try, but you don't get that chair anymore.

336
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:36,450
那是我的椅子了.你来坐我的大腿好了
That is my chair now. You can sit on my Iap.

337
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:39,464
不，我收回我的话！
No, I take that back!

338
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:43,457
我想椅子应该是我的
I think I shouId get the chair.

339
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:48,428
为什么呢？ 你弄坏了椅子，你也弄坏了椅子
-How do you figure? -You broke a chair and you broke a chair.

340
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,442
这里没坏的椅子是我的
The onIy one here that hasn't broken a chair is me.

341
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:54,445
不，不，不.这张椅子哪儿都不能去
No, no, no. This chair's not going anywhere.

342
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:57,448
什么逻辑啊？ 逻辑…
-Where's the Iogic in that? -The Iogic...

343
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,451
…就是我们是两个人…
...is that there are two of us...

344
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:04,478
…我们都可以把椅子分成两半
...and we are both strong enough to break a chair in haIf.

345
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:08,482
那么乔伊弄坏我的椅子，而我一无所获？
So Joey breaks my chair, and I get nothing?

346
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,497
没错
That's right.

347
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,523
你们怎么了？黑社会？
What are you guys, Iike, a gang or something?

348
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,495
没错，是的
Yeah, we are.

349
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:26,500
我们是眼镜蛇帮
We're the Cobras.

350
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:32,472
请问厄尔在哪里？他是总务部经理
Where can I find EarI? He's the suppIy manager here.

351
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,484
我不认识厄尔
I don't know any EarI.

352
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,509
我在这里！
I'm right here!

353
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:41,526
厄尔？
EarI?

354
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:44,529
我是菲比
I'm Phoebe.

355
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:46,531
菲比
Phoebe?

356
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,533
卖碳粉的小姐？
The Iady who seIIs toner?

357
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:51,502
听着，你不能自杀
Look, you can't kiII yourseIf.

358
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:54,505
我很感激你赶过来…
Look, I reaIIy appreciate you coming down--

359
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,507
不，我不能让你那么做
No, I can't Iet you do it.

360
00:22:56,541 --> 00:23:00,534
为什么？因为命运让我今天打电话给你
-Why? -Because, fate made me caII you today.

361
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,515
我还以为你是打电话来卖碳粉
I thought it was toner.

362
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:08,508
好好想一想，好吗？这根本不是我的正职
Think about it, okay? This isn't even my reguIar job.

363
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:11,545
我第一天上班就第一个打电话给你
My first day, you're my first caII.

364
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:15,549
其他人可能会挂掉电话，但我不会那么做…
Somebody eIse may have hung up, but I wouIdn't do that...

365
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,562
因为我了解这种事
...because I know about this stuff.

366
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:20,565
我妈是自杀的真的吗？
-My mom kiIIed herseIf. -ReaIIy?

367
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:24,558
她怎么自杀的？我绝不会教你
-How? -I'm not gonna give you tips.

368
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,538
你看不出来…
Don't you see that this...

369
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:31,565
这些都是注定的，所以我才会来阻止你自杀？
...aII came together so I couId stop you from doing this?

370
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:36,536
这不是巧合吗？ 不，这是命中注定
-CouIdn't it just be a coincidence? -No, it's fate.

371
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,550
它看起来不像是命中注定
It doesn't reaIIy seem Iike enough to be fate.

372
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,552
喔，好吧
Oh, weII.

373
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,577
好吧，有件事很奇怪
Okay, here's a weird thing.

374
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:47,581
我妈妈也是总务部经理
My mother was aIso a suppIy manager.

375
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,596
事实上我是办公室经理
I'm actuaIIy the office manager.

376
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,598
我的天啊！她也是！
Oh, my God! So was she!

377
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,566
还有这个，好吧
And get this, okay.

378
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:59,570
你叫厄尔，对吧？她叫做普厄儿
Your name is EarI, right? Her name was PearI.

379
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,595
普…厄尔
Puh-EarI.

380
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,576
还有别的证据吗？
Was there anything eIse?

381
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,601
当然有
Sure.

382
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,581
你是哪里人？
Where're you from?

383
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:14,574
费城喔，我的天啊，她也是！
-PhiIadeIphia. -Oh, my God, so was she!

384
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:17,611
我都起鸡皮疙瘩了
I've got goose bumps.

385
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:21,615
真的吗？我穿太多了，而且这里很热
-ReaIIy? -I'm wearing Iayers, and it's warm.

386
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,629
或许这些混蛋不在乎你…
These jerks might not care about you...

387
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:28,656
但宇宙在乎你，那才是最重要的
...but the universe does, and that says a Iot.

388
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,603
你们听到了吗？
Did you hear that?

389
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,606
我不需要你们在乎我…
I don't need you guys to care about me...

390
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,608
因为宇宙在乎我
...because the universe cares!

391
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:41,635
整个宇宙在乎我！
The whoIe universe!

392
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:48,642
我真的希望他们能在乎我一下
I reaIIy wish they'd care a IittIe bit.

393
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:52,657
我认为不是你的问题，这里太变态了
You know, I don't think it's you. This is a freaky pIace.

394
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:55,660
嘿，伙计们！
Hey, guys!

395
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:59,653
噢，不，是你的原因 好吧
-Oh, no, it's you. -Yeah.

396
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:02,633
喔，这真的是太可怕了
Oh, this is terribIe.

397
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,636
所有的东西都毁了
Everything is destroyed.

398
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,637
你看这个
Look at this.

399
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:10,664
它一定很重要我才会保存它 现在我看不出来它是什么东西
It meant enough for me to save, and now I can't teII what it is.

400
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,669
它还是软软的
It's stiII soft.

401
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:20,640
你觉得它是什么呢？
What do you think this is?

402
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,676
我想它是老鼠
I think it was a mouse.

403
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:33,698
你还好吗？甜心 你觉得呢？
-How are you, honey? -How do you think I am?

404
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:36,667
你毁了我的童年回忆…
You've wrecked my chiIdhood memories...

405
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,669
你们爱罗斯比爱我多
...you Iove Ross more than me.

406
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:42,696
我刚刚还拿死了的老鼠碰我的脸
And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face.

407
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:47,667
甜心，我们爱你就像我们爱罗斯
Sweetheart, we Iove you just as much as Ross.

408
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,680
箱子的事我很抱歉…
I'm sorry about what happened...

409
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:53,673
也许我永远没办法补偿你…
...and I probabIy can't make it up to you...

410
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:57,711
但这是个开始
...but here's a start.

411
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:01,726
这是什么？ 我的保时捷钥匙
-What's this? -It's the key to my Porsche.

412
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,729
你的保时捷钥匙
WeII, the key to your Porsche.

413
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:06,731
什么？
What?

414
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:08,756
什么？
What?!

415
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:13,727
我一直想把它卖掉 有天我在车子看到自己的倒影
I've considered getting rid of it. I saw my refIection the other day.

416
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:18,698
你妈说的对，我看起来像个瘪三
Your mother's right, I do Iook Iike an ass.

417
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:21,712
你要把它送给我？你一定是在开玩笑
You're giving it to me? You're kidding.

418
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,737
等一下
WeII, wait a minute.

419
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:28,742
几箱蠢东西湿掉了，她就可以拿到保时捷？
A coupIe of stupid boxes get wet, and she gets a Porsche?

420
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:32,757
我们去兜过风吧太帅了！
-Let's take a drive? -AII right!

421
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:36,750
我呢？我是医学奇迹！
What about me? I'm a medicaI marveI!

422
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,747
嘿，你们都在
Hey, guys.

423
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,749
你们看到钱德的椅子了吗？
Have you seen ChandIer's chair?

424
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,752
乔伊把它弄坏了，于是他把它丢了
Joey broke it. He got rid of it.

425
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:05,779
你在开玩笑吗？我得到了保时捷 而且巴卡兰格被丢掉了
Are you kidding? I get a Porsche and the BarcaIounger's gone?

426
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:09,783
这是有史以来最棒的一天
This is the best day ever!
