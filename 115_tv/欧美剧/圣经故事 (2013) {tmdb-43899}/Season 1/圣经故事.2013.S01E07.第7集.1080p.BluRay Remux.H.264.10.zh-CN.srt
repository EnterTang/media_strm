00:09:02,816 --> 00:09:04,753
‐求你们 救救我们吧 ‐他们救不了我们
‐Please, help us. ‐They can't help us.

132
00:09:04,786 --> 00:09:06,390
没人能救得了我们
No one can.

133
00:09:06,423 --> 00:09:08,093
我们是在这里被杀死的 所以我们永远逃不出去
We were killed here, so we can never escape.

134
00:09:08,126 --> 00:09:09,830
很抱歉 但她说得对
Sorry, but she's right.

135
00:09:09,863 --> 00:09:12,369
如果你们死在这里 你们将被永远困在这里
If you die here, you're trapped here forever.

136
00:09:12,402 --> 00:09:14,105
也许我们应该试着帮她们一下
Maybe we're supposed to try and help them, though.

137
00:09:14,138 --> 00:09:17,612
这体验可以被叫做"谋杀屋逃离记"
I mean, it is called the "Escape from Murder House Experience."

138
00:09:17,646 --> 00:09:19,048
‐求你们了 ‐求求你们 帮帮我们吧
‐ Please. ‐ Please, help us.

139
00:09:19,081 --> 00:09:21,487
注释：Infantata：出自《美国恐怖故事第一季：谋杀屋》
是塔塔怪婴
It's the Infantata.

140
00:09:26,964 --> 00:09:29,803
这血迹是真的吗?
Is that fake blood?

141
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:33,143
‐它把我划伤了 他妈的真划伤了 ‐这不对劲!
‐It cut me. It really fucking cut me. ‐This isn't right!

142
00:09:33,176 --> 00:09:35,949
‐请停下! ‐我们不喜欢这样! 太过了!
‐ Please, stop! ‐ We don't like it! It's too much!

143
00:09:35,982 --> 00:09:38,153
我们要停下! 求你们了! 现在就停下!
And we want it to stop! Please! Now!

144
00:09:41,427 --> 00:09:44,733
请停下! 我们不喜欢这样! 太逼真了!
Please, stop! We don't like it! It's too real!

145
00:09:44,766 --> 00:09:46,503
你们不应该伤害我们!
You're not supposed to hurt us!

146
00:09:46,537 --> 00:09:48,541
这不是假的 这是真的!
It's not fake. It's real!

147
00:09:48,574 --> 00:09:50,143
出去!
Get out of here!

148
00:09:50,177 --> 00:09:51,847
快!
Now!

149
00:10:00,765 --> 00:10:05,508
不!
No!

150
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,979
我告诉过你你 无脑贱人 你会死在里面的
I told you, dumb bitch. You're gonna die in here.

151
00:10:08,013 --> 00:10:10,451
你在这里干嘛? 你不是死在街上了吗!
What are you doing here? You died on the street!

152
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,589
我们都是从四面八方聚集到这来的
We've all come here from all over.

153
00:10:12,622 --> 00:10:14,559
‐今天是个特殊的日子 ‐什么日子?
‐It's a special occasion. ‐What occasion?

154
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:15,962
你死的日子
The day you die.

155
00:10:20,805 --> 00:10:22,943
这是不可能的!
This isn't possible!

156
00:10:22,976 --> 00:10:24,479
你们全都不该出现在这里!
None of you should be here!

157
00:10:24,513 --> 00:10:26,617
求你了 停止这一切!
Please, make this stop!

158
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:39,710
注释：恐怖小丑：《美国恐怖故事第四季：畸形秀》角色，杀人如麻，手法残忍。
你被恐怖小丑击杀
You were killed by Twisty.

159
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:43,784
游戏结束
你现在被永远困在谋杀屋了
You are now trapped in the Murder House forever.

160
00:10:43,818 --> 00:10:46,924
这操作器太烂了 一直在出现故障
These controls suck. It keeps glitching.

161
00:10:46,957 --> 00:10:48,894
我本来可以逃出去的 但是正当我试图逃跑的时候
I could have escaped, but it froze up again right when

162
00:10:48,928 --> 00:10:50,832
‐它就卡住了 ‐好吧 听着 这个很容易修复的
‐I tried to run. ‐Okay. I mean, look, that's an easy fix.

163
00:10:50,865 --> 00:10:52,636
但整体上你觉得怎么样
But what do you think in general?

164
00:10:52,669 --> 00:10:54,773
拜托 画面很棒 不是吗?
Come on, the graphics are amazing, aren't they?

165
00:10:54,806 --> 00:10:56,577
是的
Yeah.

166
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:57,746
但是呢?
But?

167
00:10:57,779 --> 00:10:59,549
别误会
Don't take this the wrong way,

168
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:02,455
但是 你真的有去看过这部剧吗?
but, like, have you even ever actually watched the show?

169
00:11:02,489 --> 00:11:04,526
是的 我看了这部剧 虽然我没像你
Yes, I've watched the show. I'm not an obsessive fan

170
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:06,664
这么着迷 但是……我确实看过这部剧
like you, but... I've watched the show.

171
00:11:06,697 --> 00:11:08,834
就算最佛的粉丝都会被气走
Even casual fans of the show are gonna be pissed

172
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:10,538
因为阿迪在里面是个鬼魂
because Addie is a ghost there

173
00:11:10,571 --> 00:11:12,107
还有其他几季的其他角色
and there are other characters from other seasons

174
00:11:12,141 --> 00:11:13,811
不可能会到谋杀屋来
who have no business being there.

175
00:11:13,844 --> 00:11:15,782
其次 我认为你可能不知道
Second, I think you're missing the reason

176
00:11:15,815 --> 00:11:18,253
为什么粉丝们这么想回到谋杀屋
why fans keep wanting to go back to Murder House.

177
00:11:18,287 --> 00:11:20,090
并非是说他们想把更多的人困在那里
It's not that they want to trap more people there.

178
00:11:20,123 --> 00:11:22,696
而是他们想要感受新人能不能
They want to feel the tension of whether or not

179
00:11:22,729 --> 00:11:24,733
逃出去的紧张感
the new people are gonna be able to escape or not.

180
00:11:24,766 --> 00:11:26,670
把人们困在这座房子里
The thing that always trips people up in the house

181
00:11:26,704 --> 00:11:29,141
并且引诱他们向下深入 最终被困于此的东西
and leads them down that path to getting stuck there

182
00:11:29,175 --> 00:11:30,912
是他们没做好人的本分
is that they don't deal with their human shit.

183
00:11:30,945 --> 00:11:33,484
他们要么太自私 要么太贪婪
They're too selfish or greedy

184
00:11:33,517 --> 00:11:35,755
要么刻薄 占有欲过强 或者抑郁了
or mean or possessive or depressed,

185
00:11:35,788 --> 00:11:36,991
所以他们被迫待在
so they're forced to stay like that,

186
00:11:37,024 --> 00:11:38,561
或是说被永远困在这座房子里
frozen in the house forever.

187
00:11:38,594 --> 00:11:39,997
行吧 我明白你的意思了
Okay, I hear you.

188
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,567
但这效果挺恐怖的
But it's scary.

189
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,136
是吧?这还不够吗
Right? Isn't it enough

190
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:46,009
如果 如果把它们放置于同一背景 不还是很可怕吗?
if‐if it's in the same basic setting but it's scary?

191
00:11:46,042 --> 00:11:47,912
我不知道
I don't know.

192
00:11:47,946 --> 00:11:51,587
注释：Jaws 2（《大白鲨2》）：是对经典原作的苍白模仿，对观众而言毫无悬念。
可能这就是人们为什么想拍《大白鲨2》吧
That's exactly what the people who made Jaws 2 thought.

193
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,125
好吧 呃…
Okay. Um...

194
00:11:55,962 --> 00:11:57,932
我竭尽全力了
I put everything into this.

195
00:11:57,966 --> 00:12:01,139
我辞职 就为了专心研发它 我把房子抵押出去了
I quit my job to develop it. I mortgaged the house

196
00:12:01,172 --> 00:12:02,876
就为了能雇到程序员
so that I could hire the programmers

197
00:12:02,909 --> 00:12:04,579
他们在我们的车库里昼夜不停地工作
who have been working in our garage day and night.

198
00:12:04,613 --> 00:12:07,819
我需要用它来黏合我们的关系 黏合我们整个家庭
I need this to work out for us. For our family.

199
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:11,927
‐这一切又不是我强迫你做的 ‐我做这一切
‐I didn't ask you to do any of this. ‐I did this

200
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,597
是为了你 因为我觉得…
for you because I thought...

201
00:12:13,631 --> 00:12:16,570
我觉得我们能通过你最爱的剧来重归于好
I thought we could bond over your favorite show.

202
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:18,641
你陪我看看就行了啊
You could've just watched it with me.

203
00:12:18,674 --> 00:12:21,814
我爱你 妈妈 但是你并不是真的懂得这部剧的精髓
I love you, Mom, but you don't really get the vibe of the show.

204
00:12:21,847 --> 00:12:24,753
一点……也不懂
Like... at all.

205
00:12:26,222 --> 00:12:29,296
你是再说 我一点也不懂你
You're saying I don't get you at all.

206
00:12:31,165 --> 00:12:33,002
我在努力了
I'm trying.

207
00:12:33,971 --> 00:12:35,207
等等 亲爱的 你要去哪儿?
Wait, honey. Where are you going?

208
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,012
我点了汉堡外卖
I got HiHo burgers from Postmates.

209
00:12:38,046 --> 00:12:40,016
你要去哪儿?
Where you going?

210
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,920
我今晚要住在爸爸家
I'm gonna stay at Dad's tonight.

211
00:12:41,954 --> 00:12:45,093
事实上 我想我要在那里待上几周吧
Actually, I think I'm gonna stay there for a couple of weeks.

212
00:12:45,127 --> 00:12:46,830
最近这里的事情
Things have gotten

213
00:12:46,864 --> 00:12:49,636
变得很奇怪
so weird around here lately.

214
00:12:50,605 --> 00:12:53,644
罗里
Rory.

215
00:13:17,124 --> 00:13:18,193
园艺剪刀
Garden shears.

216
00:14:10,765 --> 00:14:12,969
无处可逃
There's no escape.

217
00:15:26,917 --> 00:15:29,154
通常我会等到参观结束时
Usually I wait until the end of the tour

218
00:15:29,188 --> 00:15:31,225
再说坏消息 但是…
to give the bad news, but...

219
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:34,399
都家喻户晓了 何必呢?
why bother delaying the inevitable?

220
00:15:34,432 --> 00:15:37,305
一年多前 他们在这座房子里发现了九具尸体
They found nine bodies in the house a year or so ago.

221
00:15:37,338 --> 00:15:39,309
我知道
I know.

222
00:15:39,342 --> 00:15:42,382
我还知道有具尸体是鲁比·麦克丹尼尔
And I know about the body of that girl Ruby McDaniel

223
00:15:42,415 --> 00:15:44,151
他们一个月前在后院里发现的
they found in the backyard a month later.

224
00:15:44,184 --> 00:15:47,257
噢 上帝
Oh, God.

225
00:15:47,292 --> 00:15:48,928
你该不会是那些热衷于谋杀案的粉丝
You're not one of those murder nerds

226
00:15:48,961 --> 00:15:51,065
只是想到房子里来几张自拍
who's just here to take Instagram selfies

227
00:15:51,098 --> 00:15:52,936
发到Instagram上吧? 因为我知道
inside the house? Because I know.

228
00:15:52,969 --> 00:15:55,474
我知道这是全美在售的最烂的房子
I know this is the shittiest listing in America, and I know

229
00:15:55,508 --> 00:15:58,012
还有 我被这栋烂房子缠上
that it says a lot about what the other agents at my office

230
00:15:58,046 --> 00:15:59,783
很能说明我办公室里的其他职员 对我的看法
think about me that I'm the one who's stuck with it,

231
00:15:59,816 --> 00:16:02,322
但是抱歉 对待工作我是认真的
but I'm sorry. I take my job seriously.

232
00:16:02,355 --> 00:16:04,191
对我来说 任何一座在售的房子
To me, every listing

233
00:16:04,224 --> 00:16:07,164
就是 是一个在寻找新家庭的孤儿
is‐is a little orphan child looking for a new family

234
00:16:07,197 --> 00:16:09,402
希望能被收养 确实 这个孩子还自带行李
to adopt it. And, yes, this one has some baggage

235
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:10,905
还有一些真正的传闻
and some real issues,

236
00:16:10,938 --> 00:16:13,009
但它也同样值得被爱
but it is no less deserving of love.

237
00:16:13,042 --> 00:16:14,913
‐多少钱?‐你认真的?
‐How much? ‐Seriously?

238
00:16:14,946 --> 00:16:16,148
我是在投资
It's an investment.

239
00:16:16,182 --> 00:16:19,088
好吧 呃 你很幸运
Okay. Uh, well, you're in luck.

240
00:16:19,121 --> 00:16:22,094
银行基本上是打算单以地价售卖这座房子
The bank is basically willing to sell it for land value.

241
00:16:22,127 --> 00:16:23,364
那是多少钱?
How much is that?

242
00:16:23,397 --> 00:16:25,066
60万美元
$600,000.

243
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,505
但是 对他们来说很不幸的是
But, unfortunately for them,

244
00:16:27,538 --> 00:16:29,108
没有人愿意买
no one's been willing to pay that,

245
00:16:29,141 --> 00:16:32,782
‐所以他们愿意接受任何出价 10万美元
‐so they are open to any offers. ‐$100,000.

246
00:16:36,823 --> 00:16:38,226
我得打个电话
I need to make a call,

247
00:16:38,259 --> 00:16:39,462
但我想你刚刚已经成功把房子买下了
but I think you just bought yourself a house.

248
00:16:39,496 --> 00:16:42,067
当然 恕不退还
As is, of course.

249
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,437
这玩意儿比废料排放场
This thing is harder to move

250
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:46,108
还难搬
than a toxic waste dump.

251
00:16:46,142 --> 00:16:49,382
珍妮? 嗨 嗨 是啊 我想我找到人
Jenny? Hi. Hi. Yeah, I think I found someone

252
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,953
收养我们的小怪崽房子了
to adopt our little devil baby house.

253
00:16:51,987 --> 00:16:53,991
没有意外
No contingencies.

254
00:17:00,905 --> 00:17:03,410
你现在是我的了
You're mine.

255
00:17:03,444 --> 00:17:07,485
我会让你向我袒露一切秘密的
I am going to make you reveal all your secrets to me.

256
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:23,149
罗里 亲爱的 你看起来真可爱
Rory. Honey, you look so cute.

257
00:17:23,182 --> 00:17:25,421
‐瞧瞧你 ‐妈
‐ Look at you. ‐ Mom.

258
00:17:25,454 --> 00:17:28,159
‐你来干嘛? ‐噢 呃 我就给你多送点衣服
‐What are you doing here? ‐Oh, um, I just brought you some extra clothes.

259
00:17:28,192 --> 00:17:30,030
我会出趟远门 要一周左右
I am gonna be going away for about a week or so.

260
00:17:30,063 --> 00:17:31,433
去哪里?
Where?

261
00:17:31,466 --> 00:17:33,437
我要去参加万圣节恐怖大会
I'm going to a Halloween horror convention.

262
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,175
《美国恐怖故事》的编剧们会发表谈话
The writers of American Horror Story are doing a talk.

263
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:37,979
我要向他们问问关于谋杀屋里的一切
I'm gonna ask them to tell me all about Murder House.

264
00:17:38,012 --> 00:17:40,250
这就是 最重要的环节
What it means, what the most important aspects are.

265
00:17:40,284 --> 00:17:41,553
嘿 我在听取你的意见
Hey, I'm taking your advice.

266
00:17:41,586 --> 00:17:43,222
我在努力尝试理解精髓
I'm trying to figure out the vibe.

267
00:17:43,256 --> 00:17:44,826
亲耳去听 听方为实
Right from the horse's mouth.

268
00:17:46,062 --> 00:17:48,099
‐史蒂文 ‐米歇尔
‐Steven. ‐Michelle.

269
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,172
抱歉 我只是无意中听到
I'm sorry, I just overheard

270
00:17:51,205 --> 00:17:52,442
‐你刚和罗里说的 ‐是啊 我也很抱歉
‐what you were telling Rory. ‐Yeah, I'm sorry, too,

271
00:17:52,475 --> 00:17:53,510
因为这不关你的事
'cause it's none of your business.

272
00:17:53,544 --> 00:17:54,979
当你破产
Well, when you go broke

273
00:17:55,013 --> 00:17:56,917
我得一人供养罗里的时候
and I have to pay for everything for Rory,

274
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,186
就与我有关了
it will be my business.

275
00:17:58,219 --> 00:17:59,589
罗里 能让我和你爸爸单独谈谈吗?
Rory, can you give your dad and I a moment?

276
00:17:59,622 --> 00:18:01,326
不 他应该听听 米歇尔
No. He should hear this. Michelle,

277
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:03,029
你太不切实际了
you're in over your head.

278
00:18:03,062 --> 00:18:04,933
你又陷入某种狂热之中了
You're on one of your obsessive kicks again.

279
00:18:04,966 --> 00:18:06,937
你搞出幺蛾子 还蒙上双眼
You pull this shit, and you get blinders on,

280
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,540
然后走啊 走啊 走啊
and you go, and you go, and you go

281
00:18:08,574 --> 00:18:10,076
‐一直走到悬崖边也不肯停下 ‐你知道的
‐until you drive yourself straight off a cliff. ‐You know,

282
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,613
对于你还是总想指责我的梦想
I'm sorry that you've always felt the need

283
00:18:11,646 --> 00:18:13,417
我感到很抱歉 但我们不再是夫妻了
to dump on my dreams, but we're not married anymore,

284
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:15,053
所以我能不用考虑你的想法就去做
so I can do without your opinion.

285
00:18:15,086 --> 00:18:16,590
非常感谢你 史蒂文
Thank you so much, Steven.

286
00:18:16,623 --> 00:18:19,061
如果你能不要再怀恨在心 仿佛那是血海深仇
If you could just look past that giant chip on your shoulder,

287
00:18:19,094 --> 00:18:21,933
你就会明白我只是想帮你
it would be so clear to you that I'm just trying to help you.

288
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:24,037
我曾经娶了你 我爱你
I was married to you, and I love you

289
00:18:24,071 --> 00:18:25,541
尽管发生了这一切
in spite of everything that happened,

290
00:18:25,574 --> 00:18:27,077
我看清了你
and I see you.

291
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,282
如果说你有一个致命的缺点
And if you've got one fatal flaw,

292
00:18:29,315 --> 00:18:31,420
那就是你过于确信
it's that you're so convinced

293
00:18:31,453 --> 00:18:32,955
有什么东西等待你去证明
that you've got something to prove

294
00:18:32,989 --> 00:18:35,026
就算你身死陨首 也非要去证明一番
that you will kill yourself to prove it.

295
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:36,963
如果我是个男人 那就叫雄心壮志
And if I were a man, that would be called drive.

296
00:18:36,997 --> 00:18:38,967
甚至是令人钦佩的雄心壮志
Admirable ambition, even.

297
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:40,404
得了吧 米歇尔
Come on, Michelle.

298
00:18:41,406 --> 00:18:44,211
亲爱的 你能把这个给你爸吗?
Can you give that to your father, sweetie?

299
00:18:46,115 --> 00:18:48,487
给我们一点时间?
Give us a moment?

300
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,593
这次旅行会解决我们所有的烦恼
This trip is gonna be the answer to all our worries.

301
00:18:51,626 --> 00:18:53,363
妈妈 爸爸是对的
Dad's right, Mom.

302
00:18:53,397 --> 00:18:55,166
你不需要向我证明什么
You don't have to prove anything to me.

303
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,037
我觉得你棒极了
I think you're awesome.

304
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,309
谢谢你 我的好孩子
Thank you, my sweet boy.

305
00:18:59,342 --> 00:19:01,546
‐我爱你 ‐我也爱你
‐I love you. ‐Love you, too.

306
00:19:02,515 --> 00:19:03,984
好吧
Okay.

307
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,921
你玩得开心
You have fun.

308
00:19:25,761 --> 00:19:27,965
你会死在里面的
You're gonna die in there.

309
00:19:40,324 --> 00:19:41,493
那么 你们的计划是?
So, what's your guys's plan?

310
00:19:41,526 --> 00:19:42,995
我要去夜店
I'm going to the club.

311
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:44,299
想要一个没死的老二
Desperate for some dick

312
00:19:44,332 --> 00:19:45,501
想了十几年了
that hasn't been dead for a decade.

313
00:19:45,534 --> 00:19:47,003
我也是
Same.

314
00:19:47,037 --> 00:19:48,440
我要去看我的兄弟
I'm going to see my brother.

315
00:19:48,473 --> 00:19:50,276
我要去看看大海
I'm just gonna go look at the ocean.

316
00:19:50,311 --> 00:19:52,013
我想我已经开始对死亡感到沮丧了
Think I'm starting to get depressed about being dead.

317
00:19:52,047 --> 00:19:53,650
如果我是你 我就不会进去
I wouldn't go in there if I were you.

318
00:19:53,684 --> 00:19:55,488
那里面已经挤得要死了
It's already crowded as fuck.

319
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:03,670
‐我能帮你点什么? ‐嗨
‐ Can I help you? ‐ Hi.

320
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:06,141
你们是为了万圣节才打扮的吗?
Do you guys just dress up in time for Halloween?

321
00:20:06,175 --> 00:20:07,578
你是狂热粉丝吗?
Are you superfans?

322
00:20:07,612 --> 00:20:10,317
‐什么的狂热粉丝? ‐得了吧 宝贝!
‐ Superfans of what? ‐ Come on, babe!

323
00:20:10,351 --> 00:20:11,720
时间不等人
Time's a‐wasting.

324
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:13,557
先进来待一会儿
Come in for a little bit first.

325
00:20:24,379 --> 00:20:27,017
噢 呃…你好?
Oh, um... Hello?

326
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:29,522
等等
Wait.

327
00:20:29,556 --> 00:20:35,467
有人吗?
Hello?

328
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:37,204
有人在吗?
Anyone?

329
00:20:38,507 --> 00:20:40,711
有人吗?我是米歇尔
Hello? I'm Michelle.

330
00:20:40,744 --> 00:20:43,149
新房主
The new owner.

331
00:20:43,182 --> 00:20:44,619
有人吗?
Hello?

332
00:20:44,652 --> 00:20:46,723
出来 出来吧 无论你们在哪里
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

333
00:20:46,756 --> 00:20:49,495
有人吗?有人吗?我想如果你们在这
Hello? Hello? I assume if you're here

334
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:51,232
你们就是狂热粉
that you're superfans.

335
00:20:51,265 --> 00:20:53,069
我知道你们能听到我
I know you can hear me.

336
00:20:53,102 --> 00:20:54,839
很乐意和你们聊聊节目的事
Love to chat with you about the show.

337
00:20:54,872 --> 00:20:56,610
有人吗?
Hello?

338
00:20:56,643 --> 00:20:59,214
我正在制作一款基于谋杀屋的游戏
I'm making a game based on the Murder House.

339
00:20:59,248 --> 00:21:01,085
我知道你们在这
I know you're here.

340
00:21:01,118 --> 00:21:03,757
我只是想试图理解精髓 拜托?
I'm just trying to understand the vibe. Please?

341
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:07,331
不管那意味着什么
Whatever that means.

342
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,203
有人吗?
Hello?

343
00:21:13,209 --> 00:21:15,213
有人在吗?
Anyone?

344
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,622
有人吗?
Hello?

345
00:21:37,491 --> 00:21:39,796
如果你能逃出这座房子
If you could escape this house‐‐

346
00:21:39,829 --> 00:21:43,470
不是逃到外面的世界 而是一个…
not out in the world but, like, in a...

347
00:21:43,503 --> 00:21:45,608
能让你的灵魂安息的地方
put your soul to rest kind of way‐‐

348
00:21:45,641 --> 00:21:47,143
你会这么做吗?
would you do it?

349
00:21:47,177 --> 00:21:49,816
也许在我遇见你之前的几年前我会这么想
Maybe a few years ago before I met you.

350
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:53,523
只要这里永远有你在 我就不介意永远地继续待下去
I don't mind going on forever as long as forever includes you.

351
00:21:54,726 --> 00:21:57,632
‐你想要让我解脱吗? ‐不
‐Would you want that? ‐No.

352
00:21:57,665 --> 00:22:00,704
即使这意味着你父亲们也能自由和解脱?
Not even if it meant freedom and relief for your dads?

353
00:22:00,738 --> 00:22:01,840
让我的爸爸们见鬼去吧
Fuck my dads.

354
00:22:01,873 --> 00:22:03,510
让这里所有的鬼魂见鬼去吧
Fuck every ghost in here.

355
00:22:03,543 --> 00:22:05,414
让所有不是你和我的家伙
Fuck anyone and everyone

356
00:22:05,447 --> 00:22:07,183
都见鬼去吧
who isn't you or me.

357
00:22:09,722 --> 00:22:12,395
天啊 外面活人的世界是如此的艰难
God, life is rough out in the world of living.

358
00:22:12,428 --> 00:22:15,501
我不需要钱 但为了不光靠
I don't need money, but I took a shit job at Erewhon

359
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:17,170
看家庭赛乐赛这个节目来打发日子
just to have something to do with my days

360
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:18,907
我在Erewohn找了份差劲的工作
besides watch Family Feud.

361
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,413
我的生活基本上就是在
My life is basically just waiting

362
00:22:21,446 --> 00:22:23,684
等待每年的万圣节的过程中度过的
for Halloween to roll around every year.

363
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:26,188
如果不是盼望着你
If I didn't have you to look forward to,

364
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:27,692
我压根都不想活着
I wouldn't want to be alive at all.

365
00:22:27,725 --> 00:22:30,431
我不会让任何事耽误我们在一起的时间
I won't let anything get in the way of our time together.

366
00:22:30,464 --> 00:22:32,702
即使你会保持年轻性感 而我会
Even though you're gonna stay young and hot and I'm gonna get

367
00:22:32,735 --> 00:22:34,872
‐变老和长满皱纹?‐噢 阴毛都变灰白
‐old and wrinkly? ‐Oh, bring on the gray pubes.

368
00:22:36,776 --> 00:22:39,482
我爱你 我爱你
‐I love you. ‐I love you.

369
00:22:40,551 --> 00:22:42,455
让我们去制造些麻烦吧
Let's go cause some trouble.

370
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:27,845
有人吗?
Hello?

371
00:23:32,822 --> 00:23:34,892
对不起
Sorry.

372
00:23:36,396 --> 00:23:38,867
我通常只有自慰后才会这样哭
I usually only cry like this after I masturbate.

373
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,236
什么?
Pardon?

374
00:23:40,269 --> 00:23:41,639
没什么
Nothing.

375
00:23:43,977 --> 00:23:46,248
你不是前几天我看到的和房地产经纪人
Aren't you that lady I saw talking to the Realtor

376
00:23:46,282 --> 00:23:47,718
交谈的那位女士吗?
the other day?

377
00:23:47,752 --> 00:23:49,789
你不会真的买下了这个地方吧?
You didn't actually buy this place, did you?

378
00:23:49,822 --> 00:23:51,659
不 呃…
No. Um...

379
00:23:51,693 --> 00:23:53,764
我只是得找个办法进来
I just needed to find a way to get in.

380
00:23:53,797 --> 00:23:55,266
交易永远不会结束
Deal's never gonna close.

381
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,671
呃 其实我没有钱
Um, I don't actually have the money.

382
00:23:57,705 --> 00:23:59,642
我在制作一款电子游戏
I'm making a video game,

383
00:23:59,675 --> 00:24:02,348
但我陷入了创作困境
and I am creatively stuck, and this is

384
00:24:02,381 --> 00:24:05,788
而这是我最后一次尝试获得某种灵感
my last effort at getting some sort of inspiration.

385
00:24:05,821 --> 00:24:07,892
我真的不知道还他妈能做些什么了
I actually don't know what else to fucking do.

386
00:24:07,925 --> 00:24:09,896
它暴力吗?
Is it violent?

387
00:24:09,929 --> 00:24:11,633
因为我一直劝告家长们
Because I've always counseled parents

388
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:14,305
暴力电子游戏会对孩子们造成危害
that violent video games are terrible for children.

389
00:24:14,338 --> 00:24:15,707
等等
Wait a minute.

390
00:24:15,741 --> 00:24:18,480
你是 呃……?
Aren't you, um...?

391
00:24:19,715 --> 00:24:21,419
你在这里做什么?
What are you doing here?

392
00:24:21,453 --> 00:24:23,390
偿还我的罪孽
Paying for my sins.

393
00:24:23,423 --> 00:24:26,362
就像这鬼地方的其他人一样
Just like everyone else in this godforsaken place.

394
00:24:26,396 --> 00:24:27,832
你知道什么是永恒幸福
You know what's a bad combination

395
00:24:27,865 --> 00:24:29,836
的坏组合吗?
for eternal happiness?

396
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:32,508
你的妻子 你永远十几岁的女儿
Your wife, your forever teenaged daughter,

397
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:33,810
她的男朋友 一个新生儿
her boyfriend, a newborn

398
00:24:33,844 --> 00:24:36,416
还有你以前的情妇
and your former mistress all trapped

399
00:24:36,449 --> 00:24:37,585
都被困在同一所房子里
in the same house together.

400
00:24:39,722 --> 00:24:42,661
好吧 这肯定是个玩笑 对吧?
Okay, this has got to be some kind of joke, right?

401
00:24:42,695 --> 00:24:43,964
我是说 你在这做什么的?
I mean, what do you do? Do you just

402
00:24:43,997 --> 00:24:45,567
你是不是在万圣节晚上
come in here and fuck with people

403
00:24:45,601 --> 00:24:48,340
来这跟偷溜进来的人上床?是吗?
on Halloween night who sneak in? Right?

404
00:24:48,373 --> 00:24:51,346
这是什么都不可能是个笑话
It's the farthest thing from a joke.

405
00:24:51,379 --> 00:24:52,715
我身处地狱
I'm in hell.

406
00:24:53,683 --> 00:24:55,320
别像这里的另一个治疗师一样
And don't start telling me it's all my fault

407
00:24:55,354 --> 00:24:57,525
跟我说这都是我的错
like that other therapist in here.

408
00:24:57,558 --> 00:24:59,929
我不想背着我妻子乱搞
I didn't want to cheat on my wife.

409
00:24:59,962 --> 00:25:02,668
我在这所房子里
I resisted for years

410
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:04,405
忍了好几年了
in this house.

411
00:25:04,438 --> 00:25:08,480
注释：Hayden（海登）：《美国恐怖故事第一季：谋杀屋》人物。
但海登真的很固执
But Hayden is really persistent,

412
00:25:08,513 --> 00:25:11,319
注释：Vivien（薇薇安）：《美国恐怖故事第一季：谋杀屋》人物，这位男士的妻子。
薇薇安有时也会如此挑剔
and Vivien can be so judgy and sullen

413
00:25:11,352 --> 00:25:13,490
‐阴沉 ‐所以 你因为出轨
‐sometimes. ‐So, you're blaming the women in your life

414
00:25:13,523 --> 00:25:15,427
在责怪你生活中的女人们?好吧
for you being a cheater? Okay.

415
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:19,368
如果你不为自己的行为负责
Um, you can never actually find forgiveness

416
00:25:19,402 --> 00:25:22,608
你永远也得不到宽恕
if you don't take responsibility for your own actions.

417
00:25:22,641 --> 00:25:25,581
我只是再说生活是复杂的
I'm just saying life is complicated.

418
00:25:25,614 --> 00:25:28,085
很显然 死亡也是
And so is death, apparently.

419
00:25:28,118 --> 00:25:30,357
问题是
The problem was

420
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:33,463
我一直以为我可以拥有一切
I always thought I could have it all.

421
00:25:33,497 --> 00:25:35,901
妻子和情妇
A wife and a mistress.

422
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:39,909
家庭和我房子外的生活
A family and a life outside my house.

423
00:25:39,942 --> 00:25:42,515
所以我死在这儿
So I ended up here

424
00:25:42,548 --> 00:25:44,452
一无所有
with nothing.

425
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,923
从你脸上的表情判断
Judging by that look on your face,

426
00:25:46,956 --> 00:25:49,795
我的专业意见是你被出轨了
my professional opinion is that you were cheated on.

427
00:25:49,829 --> 00:25:52,000
‐你看起来很激动 ‐不 呃…
‐You look triggered. ‐No. Uh...

428
00:25:52,033 --> 00:25:55,039
事实上 史蒂文对我是忠诚的
Actually, uh, Steven was faithful.

429
00:25:55,072 --> 00:25:58,647
我评判你只是因为 我不知道 因为我能
I'm judging you just because, I don't know, I can.

430
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,651
我才是我婚姻中的那个麻烦
The trouble in my marriage was me,

431
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,354
老实说
if I want to be honest.

432
00:26:02,388 --> 00:26:04,057
好吧?我总是欲求不满
Okay? I like to want things,

433
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:06,028
然后我就会痴迷于得到它们
and then I get obsessed about getting them.

434
00:26:06,061 --> 00:26:08,132
这在求爱过程中很有吸引力
It's compelling in a courtship.

435
00:26:08,165 --> 00:26:10,404
每个人都想要被需要的感觉
Everybody wants to feel like they're wanted.

436
00:26:10,437 --> 00:26:13,543
‐嗯 ‐一旦我真的得到了 我就不会那么棒了
‐Hmm. ‐I'm just not so great once I actually get it

437
00:26:13,577 --> 00:26:15,881
因为 呃 随着时间的推移 我…
'cause, um, over time, I...

438
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,557
我感到无聊
I get bored.

439
00:26:20,591 --> 00:26:23,663
然后我就会变得很伤人
And then I can be quite hurtful.

440
00:26:23,697 --> 00:26:27,504
你喜欢饥渴而不是满足的感觉
You like being hungry more than being fed.

441
00:26:28,473 --> 00:26:29,575
没错
Yes.

442
00:26:29,609 --> 00:26:31,111
没错 没错 没错
Yes, yes, yes.

443
00:26:31,144 --> 00:26:32,948
好吧 那么……
Okay, so, here's...

444
00:26:32,982 --> 00:26:35,954
我现在真正渴望的是理解
What I'm really hungering for now is an understanding.

445
00:26:35,988 --> 00:26:39,428
告诉我…告诉我这地方是什么样子 我是说
Tell me... Tell me what this place is like. I mean,

446
00:26:39,462 --> 00:26:42,100
我想知道在这里的真实感觉
I want to know what it truly feels like to be here

447
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:45,106
感受渴望 恐惧
and to feel the‐the longing and the‐the fear,

448
00:26:45,139 --> 00:26:46,976
‐还有乐趣 ‐乐趣?
‐the fun. ‐Fun?

449
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:49,415
当你听的唱片一次又一次的重播时
Is it fun when the record

450
00:26:49,448 --> 00:26:52,454
会有趣吗?
you're listening to skips over and over?

451
00:26:52,488 --> 00:26:55,427
几十年来都坐在旋转木马上 会有趣吗?
Is it fun being on a merry‐go‐round for decades?

452
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,796
不
No.

453
00:26:56,829 --> 00:26:59,702
呃 我…我在设计一款电子游戏
Uh, I'm... I'm designing a video game.

454
00:26:59,735 --> 00:27:01,472
要想成功 它必须要有趣
And for it to work, it's got to be fun.

455
00:27:01,506 --> 00:27:03,142
它得有意义
It's got to have purpose.

456
00:27:03,175 --> 00:27:05,112
你知道 必须得有意义
You know, there's got to be a point so that the player's

457
00:27:05,146 --> 00:27:07,918
‐这样玩家才会想继续玩 ‐这里漫无目的
‐gonna want to continue playing. ‐There is no purpose here.

458
00:27:07,952 --> 00:27:10,824
这里毫无意义
There is no point in here.

459
00:27:10,857 --> 00:27:15,467
这里只有无法逃离的无尽枯燥
It's just endless dull with no escape.

460
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,003
我们不在地狱里 这只是
We're not in hell. It's an old house

461
00:27:17,036 --> 00:27:18,840
洛杉矶某个街区的一座老房子
in a neighborhood in L. A.

462
00:27:18,873 --> 00:27:20,944
你知道 它周围都是很普通的房子
You know, it's surrounded by perfectly normal houses.

463
00:27:20,978 --> 00:27:22,848
这一定是有意义的 对吧?
There's got to be a point, right?

464
00:27:22,881 --> 00:27:24,619
我是说 也许甚至有办法逃走
I mean, maybe there's even a way to escape.

465
00:27:24,652 --> 00:27:27,023
只是还没人知道该怎么做
It's just nobody's figured out how yet.

466
00:27:27,056 --> 00:27:30,029
你知道 我儿子说 被困在这里的人之所以无法逃脱
You know, my son says that, uh, the people who are trapped here

467
00:27:30,062 --> 00:27:32,501
可能是因为他们活着的时候从来没能解决自己的问题
are probably stuck because they never resolved their issues

468
00:27:32,534 --> 00:27:35,774
所以他们受到的伤害变成了他们的命运
when they were alive, so their damage becomes their destiny.

469
00:27:35,807 --> 00:27:39,882
也许关键在于你们必须学习和成长
Maybe the point is that you have to learn and grow,

470
00:27:39,915 --> 00:27:42,488
这样你们才能解脱
and only then can you escape.

471
00:27:42,521 --> 00:27:45,460
所以你觉得如果我对每一个鬼魂
So you think if I have intense therapy sessions

472
00:27:45,494 --> 00:27:46,896
都进行大强度的心理治疗
with each of the ghosts,

473
00:27:46,929 --> 00:27:48,032
注释：普通人 潮浪王子 都是讲主角通过找心理医生进行心理治疗并走出困境的电影
他们就会产生一些像电影普通人
they'll have some kind of Ordinary People,

474
00:27:48,065 --> 00:27:49,635
和潮浪王子那样的重大进展
Prince of Tides breakthrough

475
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:50,971
并找到精神上的平静?
and find spiritual peace?

476
00:27:54,077 --> 00:27:55,914
抱歉
Sorry.

477
00:27:55,947 --> 00:27:58,787
那不可能发生 我被困在这里后
Not gonna happen. I tried that with Tate

478
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,056
我和塔特试过了
after I got stuck here,

479
00:28:00,089 --> 00:28:02,026
他还是和以前一样疯狂
and he's just as bananas as he's always been.

480
00:28:03,095 --> 00:28:05,901
好吧 呃…
Okay. Um...

481
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,203
呃…
Well...

482
00:28:07,236 --> 00:28:08,773
呃 我能和
Um, can I speak to somebody

483
00:28:08,807 --> 00:28:10,644
不那么迷失和绝望的人谈谈吗?
who's maybe not so lost and hopeless?

484
00:28:10,677 --> 00:28:12,781
那你可来错地儿了
Then you've come to the wrong house.

485
00:28:14,217 --> 00:28:15,887
好吧
Okay.

486
00:28:15,921 --> 00:28:17,624
呃…
Um...

487
00:28:20,297 --> 00:28:22,200
我们能帮你点什么?
Can we help you?

488
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:25,072
呃 是的
Um, yes.

489
00:28:25,106 --> 00:28:27,143
我试图理解这个地方的精髓
I'm trying to understand the vibe of this place,

490
00:28:27,176 --> 00:28:29,214
但我真正了解的是 与之相关的每个人
but all I'm really getting is that everybody

491
00:28:29,247 --> 00:28:32,654
都太疯狂了
associated with it is just... really crazy.

492
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:36,161
注释：True Blood《真爱如血》是一部共有7季80集的美国电视剧。
我只是要做一款关于《真爱如血》的电子游戏或者…
I'm just gonna make a video game about True Blood or...

493
00:28:36,194 --> 00:28:39,034
‐一些正常的东西 ‐你想真正理解这里吗?
‐something normal. ‐You want to get the vibe?

494
00:28:39,067 --> 00:28:41,939
以下是关于这个地方你需要了解的
Here's what you need to understand about this place.

495
00:28:41,973 --> 00:28:44,979
是的 是有一些鬼魂想出去
Yes, there are a few spirits who want out,

496
00:28:45,012 --> 00:28:47,685
但这里还有其他鬼魂对成长不感兴趣
but there are others here who have no interest in growth,

497
00:28:47,718 --> 00:28:50,156
我们接受自己有多完蛋
who embrace how fucked‐up we all are.

498
00:28:50,189 --> 00:28:52,628
现在 比起被困在自己的痛苦中
Now, the only thing that we love more

499
00:28:52,661 --> 00:28:54,532
我们唯一更爱的事情
than being stuck in our own misery

500
00:28:54,565 --> 00:28:55,967
就算和那些更悲惨的笨蛋
is being stuck here

501
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:58,205
一起被困在这里
with the suckers who are even more miserable.

502
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:01,111
重复就是意义
The repetition is the point.

503
00:29:01,144 --> 00:29:04,117
充斥着痛苦的无尽虚无
The endless nothing filled with pain

504
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,687
就是目的
is the purpose.

505
00:29:05,721 --> 00:29:07,591
我们唯一需要的东西
The only thing that we need

506
00:29:07,624 --> 00:29:09,595
就是用更多的灵魂来滋养痛苦
is more souls to feed the suffering.

507
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:15,072
该死
Shit.

508
00:29:15,106 --> 00:29:16,141
‐多少? ‐作为你的治疗师
‐What? ‐As your therapist,

509
00:29:16,174 --> 00:29:17,678
我的专业意见是
my professional opinion is

510
00:29:17,711 --> 00:29:19,615
‐你应该拼命地逃 ‐什么?
‐that you should run like hell. ‐What?

511
00:29:21,017 --> 00:29:22,821
呃…
Uh...

512
00:29:24,992 --> 00:29:27,331
你根本不了解这个地方
You really don't understand this place at all.

513
00:29:27,364 --> 00:29:30,202
现在就离开 否则你将被迫永远理解这个地方
Leave now or you're gonna be forced to understand forever.

514
00:29:31,773 --> 00:29:33,576
轮到你了
It's your turn.

515
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:35,012
又死了
Dead again.

516
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:06,309
说“不给糖就捣蛋”
Say "trick or treat."

517
00:30:06,342 --> 00:30:07,811
嗨 宝贝
Hi, baby.

518
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:15,159
哦
Oh.

519
00:30:15,192 --> 00:30:16,896
不
No.

520
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:20,770
拜托别这样 我们只有一晚能在一起
Please don't do that. We have one night together.

521
00:30:20,804 --> 00:30:22,941
他们花了一个星期才找到你的尸体
It took a week for them to find your body.

522
00:30:22,975 --> 00:30:24,945
我们甚至都不知道你失踪了三天
We didn't even know you were missing for three days

523
00:30:24,979 --> 00:30:26,616
因为你撒谎
because you lied

524
00:30:26,649 --> 00:30:28,286
还说你要去参加恐怖大会
and said you were going to a horror convention.

525
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:30,857
‐我很抱歉 我不想让你担心 ‐扯淡
‐I'm sorry. I didn't want you to worry. ‐Bullshit.

526
00:30:30,891 --> 00:30:32,193
你不想让我试图阻止你
You didn't want me to try and stop you.

527
00:30:32,226 --> 00:30:33,930
直到我们开始接到电话
It wasn't until we started getting calls

528
00:30:33,963 --> 00:30:36,067
我们发现你想买房子
that we found out you tried to buy a house.

529
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:38,873
我一听到这个消息 就知道你在哪里
As soon as I heard that, I knew where you were.

530
00:30:38,907 --> 00:30:40,176
我再也见不到你了
That I was never gonna see you again.

531
00:30:40,209 --> 00:30:42,046
你那愚蠢的痴迷
That your stupid fucking obsession

532
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:43,783
‐把你给害死了 ‐听我说 嘿
‐got you killed. ‐Listen to me. Hey.

533
00:30:43,817 --> 00:30:45,954
我只是想为我们做点特别的事
I just wanted to build something special for us.

534
00:30:45,987 --> 00:30:47,156
我只是想让你感到骄傲
I just wanted to make you proud.

535
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:49,695
通过制作电子游戏?
By making a video game?

536
00:30:49,728 --> 00:30:51,833
你知道你该怎么做才能打动我吗?
You know what you could have done to impress me?

537
00:30:51,866 --> 00:30:53,770
如果你去看一个他妈的心理医生
If you had went to a fucking shrink

538
00:30:53,803 --> 00:30:55,239
处理好你的破事儿
and dealt with your shit.

539
00:30:55,272 --> 00:30:58,245
如果你向我展示 人是可以改变的
If you had shown me that people can change.

540
00:30:58,278 --> 00:31:00,784
如果你在意识到自己做不到的时候 就停止制作这个该死的游戏
I would've been more proud if you quit making the fucking game

541
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:03,088
而不是让你自己他妈的被杀
once you realized that you couldn't do it,

542
00:31:03,121 --> 00:31:05,427
若不是你被你的痴迷所困住
rather than getting yourself fucking killed

543
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,965
我本会更自豪的
because you‐you get so trapped by your obsessions.

544
00:31:07,998 --> 00:31:09,969
嘿 现在说太晚了
Hey. It's too late for that.

545
00:31:10,002 --> 00:31:11,104
已经太晚了 听着 我…
It's too late for that. Look, I'm...

546
00:31:11,137 --> 00:31:13,108
我已经被困住了 好吗
I'm stuck as I am, okay? I'm stuck

547
00:31:13,141 --> 00:31:14,778
我被困在那儿了
in that place.

548
00:31:14,812 --> 00:31:16,181
没有办法能逃出谋杀屋
There's no escaping the Murder House.

549
00:31:16,214 --> 00:31:18,218
我认为有办法
I think there is.

550
00:31:19,421 --> 00:31:21,359
‐怎么做? ‐火
‐How? ‐Fire.

551
00:31:21,392 --> 00:31:24,264
火能净化一切 你需要烧掉它
Fire purifies everything. You need to burn,

552
00:31:24,298 --> 00:31:25,834
把那破房子烧的片甲不留
burn that motherfucker to the ground.

553
00:31:25,867 --> 00:31:27,871
我非常乐意做这项工作
And I'm more than happy to do the job.

554
00:31:27,905 --> 00:31:29,274
听我的 如果你那么做了
Listen to me. If you do that,

555
00:31:29,308 --> 00:31:30,710
如果它成功的话
if it works,

556
00:31:30,744 --> 00:31:31,879
我就会离开
I'm gone.

557
00:31:31,913 --> 00:31:33,716
我…
I...

558
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,054
我再也不能见到你了 好吧?
I don't see you ever again. Okay?

559
00:31:36,087 --> 00:31:38,793
你很久以前就离开我了
You were gone from me a long time ago.

560
00:31:38,826 --> 00:31:40,229
再说 是时候
Besides, it's time

561
00:31:40,262 --> 00:31:42,401
结束那座房子所造成的一切痛苦了
for all of the misery of that house to end.

562
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:44,270
我再也不想看到或听到
I never want to see or hear

563
00:31:44,305 --> 00:31:46,876
‐任何一件关于谋杀屋的事了 ‐好吧
‐one more thing about Murder House again. ‐Okay.

564
00:31:46,909 --> 00:31:48,413
但是 你看 那里也有好人
But, look, there's good people in there.

565
00:31:48,446 --> 00:31:50,249
他们正努力过着充实的生活
They're trying to live their productive lives,

566
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,419
不管那意味着什么
whatever that means.

567
00:31:51,452 --> 00:31:53,255
就答应我
Just promise me

568
00:31:53,289 --> 00:31:56,829
你不会对那房子做任何事 好吗?
you're not gonna do anything to that house, okay?

569
00:31:56,862 --> 00:31:58,366
答应我
Promise me.

570
00:31:59,468 --> 00:32:01,004
好吧
Fine.

571
00:32:01,037 --> 00:32:03,275
‐嘿 嘿 ‐什么?
‐Hey. Hey. ‐What?

572
00:32:03,309 --> 00:32:05,780
你为什么不打扮一下?
Why aren't you dressed up?

573
00:32:05,814 --> 00:32:07,451
我再也不喜欢万圣节了
I don't like Halloween anymore.

574
00:33:03,195 --> 00:33:04,932
你们进来吗?
You guys coming inside?

575
00:33:04,965 --> 00:33:07,504
‐我们喜欢按照自己的方式道别 ‐嘿
‐We like to do it our own way. ‐Hey.

576
00:33:07,537 --> 00:33:09,073
抱歉把你困在里面
Sorry about trapping you in there.

577
00:33:10,075 --> 00:33:13,081
虽然你拿着刀 但我其实是自作自受
You held the knife, but I did it to myself, really.

578
00:33:17,089 --> 00:33:19,060
离日出还有十秒
Ten seconds to sunrise.

579
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:32,106
‐这他妈的是什么? ‐噢 不
‐The fuck is this? ‐Oh, no.

580
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:34,645
‐你认识他? ‐他是我儿子
‐ You know him? ‐ He's my son.

581
00:34:34,678 --> 00:34:36,181
他想把房子烧了
He's trying to burn the house down.

582
00:34:36,214 --> 00:34:38,386
认为这会让所有的灵魂自由
Thinks it's gonna free all the spirits.

583
00:34:38,419 --> 00:34:39,455
会吗?
Will it?

584
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:41,325
天啊 我希望如此
God, I hope so.

585
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:43,161
那我们这些不想自由的人呢?
Well, what about those of us who don't want to be free?

586
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:46,034
我今天不需要这烂事儿
I do not need this shit today.

587
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,479
罗里
Rory.

588
00:34:51,512 --> 00:34:53,616
我觉得你和你儿子真的应该考虑
I think you and your son should really consider

589
00:34:53,649 --> 00:34:55,520
一些家庭心理治疗 现在 我知道你们已经见过本·哈蒙了
some family therapy. Now, I know that you've already met

590
00:34:55,553 --> 00:34:57,424
但我可以向你保证
with Ben Harmon, but I can assure you

591
00:34:57,457 --> 00:34:59,060
‐和我一起你会看到更好的成果 ‐走开
‐you'll see much better results with me. ‐Move.

592
00:34:59,093 --> 00:35:00,330
坦白说 他没那么厉害
Quite frankly, he's just not that good.

593
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:03,669
我随时都有空
I'm available anytime.

594
00:35:08,513 --> 00:35:10,350
我要将他开膛破肚 让他慢慢失血
I'm gonna gut him but make sure he bleeds out slowly enough

595
00:35:10,383 --> 00:35:12,621
趁他死之前 把他扔出去
to throw him off the property. The last thing we need is

596
00:35:12,654 --> 00:35:14,925
‐我们最不希望的就是这儿再多一个麻烦精 ‐不!
‐ another troublemaker in here. ‐ No!

597
00:35:19,968 --> 00:35:21,372
对不起了 鲁比
Sorry, Ruby.

598
00:35:21,405 --> 00:35:23,976
虽然你和斯嘉丽彼此相爱
What you and Scarlett had was so lovely,

599
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:25,713
但我们现在该走了
but it's time for us to go now.

600
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:32,461
我们再也受不了了
We can't take it anymore.

601
00:35:32,494 --> 00:35:35,065
‐我只想要这一切结束 ‐你们这些愚蠢的婊子
‐ I just need it to be over. ‐ You stupid bitches.

602
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:36,702
你不明白这意味着什么吗?
Don't you understand what that means?

603
00:35:36,735 --> 00:35:38,639
我们会化作虚无!
It means we become nothing!

604
00:35:38,673 --> 00:35:41,512
虚无也比永生更好
Nothing is better than this for all eternity.

605
00:35:45,487 --> 00:35:46,622
好样的!
Attaboy.

606
00:35:46,655 --> 00:35:49,093
燃吧 宝贝 燃吧
Burn, baby, burn.

607
00:35:49,127 --> 00:35:51,599
哈蒙医生
Dr. Harmon.

608
00:35:55,673 --> 00:35:58,546
唱片不断卡带
And the record kept skipping

609
00:35:58,579 --> 00:36:01,619
一遍 一遍……
over and over...

610
00:36:03,088 --> 00:36:05,159
．．.又一遍
...and over.

611
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,470
我很抱歉 才怪
Sorry. Not sorry.

612
00:36:26,702 --> 00:36:29,641
我能来份早餐墨西哥卷饼 一杯新鲜橙汁
Yeah, can I get a breakfast burrito, a fresh orange juice,

613
00:36:29,675 --> 00:36:32,380
哦 还有个苹果派吗?
oh, and an apple pie?

614
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:45,172
你确定这是你想要的?
Are you sure this is what you want?

615
00:36:45,205 --> 00:36:46,274
是的
Yes.

616
00:36:48,412 --> 00:36:51,418
我想你已经找到结束游戏的方法了
Guess you figured out a way to end the video game.

617
00:36:51,452 --> 00:36:53,422
它将会是畅销游戏
It'll be a best seller.

618
00:36:53,456 --> 00:36:54,691
我敢肯定
I'm sure of it.

619
00:36:58,766 --> 00:37:00,436
再见 妈妈
Goodbye, Mom.

620
00:37:01,505 --> 00:37:03,309
再见 我的好孩子
Bye, my sweet boy.

621
00:37:03,342 --> 00:37:05,045
妈妈!
Mom!

622
00:37:05,078 --> 00:37:06,749
不!快动手!点燃它!
No! Do it! Light it up!

623
00:37:06,782 --> 00:37:09,321
做吧 宝贝 动手吧!
Do it, baby, do it!

624
00:37:23,516 --> 00:37:26,187
不!不!不!
No! No! No!

625
00:37:27,256 --> 00:37:28,759
‐不!‐不!
‐No! ‐No!

626
00:37:28,793 --> 00:37:30,663
求你了
Please.

627
00:37:31,732 --> 00:37:33,436
‐不! ‐快动手
‐ No! ‐ Do it.

628
00:37:34,371 --> 00:37:36,609
动手啊!
Do it!

629
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,206
鲁比!
Ruby!

630
00:37:54,277 --> 00:37:55,747
斯嘉丽
Scarlett.

631
00:37:58,552 --> 00:38:00,255
跟我一起死吧!
Die with me!

632
00:38:46,849 --> 00:38:49,421
鬼魂不是问题所在
Well, the ghosts weren't the problem.

633
00:38:49,454 --> 00:38:51,358
都怪那些该死的电视剧粉丝
It was the damn TV show fans

634
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,696
整天源源不断地来这里自拍
that kept coming here at all hours to take selfies.

635
00:38:53,729 --> 00:38:55,300
嘿 混蛋们
Hey, assholes,

636
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,535
它只是间房子
it's just a house.

637
00:38:56,568 --> 00:38:58,271
大火已被扑灭
The fire is out

638
00:38:58,306 --> 00:38:59,708
还剩下一些余烬
except for some smoldering remnants.

639
00:38:59,741 --> 00:39:01,445
就像这样
And just like that,

640
00:39:01,478 --> 00:39:04,685
洛杉矶 或许甚至是全世界 最臭名昭著的房子之一
one of the most notorious houses in all of Los Angeles‐‐

641
00:39:04,718 --> 00:39:07,891
终于彻底消失了
maybe the world‐‐ is finally gone for good.

642
00:39:44,865 --> 00:39:47,737
‐你一定是斯嘉丽 是的 嗨
‐You must be Scarlett. ‐Yes. Hi.

643
00:39:47,771 --> 00:39:50,208
我带你看看这套房子吧
Let me show you the unit.

644
00:39:51,745 --> 00:39:53,716
如你所见 开发商们
As you can see, the developers

645
00:39:53,749 --> 00:39:55,620
不惜工本打造了这座房子
spared no expense.

646
00:39:55,653 --> 00:39:58,492
这套房子里所有的东西都是最高端的
Everything in this unit is state‐of‐the‐art,

647
00:39:58,526 --> 00:40:01,197
这些更是绝妙无比
and these are divine.

648
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:03,201
‐建筑师们花了……提姆
‐The architect went... ‐Tim.

649
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,606
我们之间能坦诚相待吗?
Can we have an honest relationship?

650
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,577
好的 没问题
Yeah, okay.

651
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:08,879
你有告诉过
Do you tell people

652
00:40:08,913 --> 00:40:11,652
来看新房子的人
who are looking at these new condo units

653
00:40:11,685 --> 00:40:13,622
这地方是圣地吗?
that these grounds are hallowed?

654
00:40:13,656 --> 00:40:15,326
圣地?
Hallowed?

655
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,262
好吧 好几十人死在了这里
Well, dozens of people died here.

656
00:40:17,297 --> 00:40:18,999
都是些重要的人
People who mattered.

657
00:40:19,033 --> 00:40:20,470
直到那场大火
Until the fire.

658
00:40:20,503 --> 00:40:22,272
你有告诉过那些潜在的买主
Do you tell potential buyers

659
00:40:22,307 --> 00:40:25,513
这幢公寓大楼
that this building of condominiums

660
00:40:25,546 --> 00:40:27,617
曾经是谋杀屋吗?
used to be the Murder House?

661
00:40:29,654 --> 00:40:31,992
事实上 没有
Actually, no.

662
00:40:32,025 --> 00:40:33,396
不 我没有
No, I don't.

663
00:40:33,429 --> 00:40:35,633
‐为什么不呢? ‐好吧 说实话
‐Why not? ‐Well, to be honest‐‐

664
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:37,937
既然你让我坦诚相待
since that's what we're aiming for‐‐

665
00:40:37,971 --> 00:40:39,408
一开始
at first,

666
00:40:39,441 --> 00:40:40,877
我很犹豫
I was torn.

667
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:42,781
我已经卖了五套房了 而且我没跟住户说过
I sold the first five units, and I said nothing

668
00:40:42,814 --> 00:40:45,753
这个地方曾经是谋杀屋
about that place that used to be here.

669
00:40:45,787 --> 00:40:49,394
但住户们已经在这个公寓里呆了半年多了
But people have been living in this new building now

670
00:40:49,428 --> 00:40:52,400
我有向他们确认过
for over six months, and I check in on my customers.

671
00:40:52,434 --> 00:40:53,836
没有人受到伤害
No one has been harmed.

672
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:56,542
没有人看到幽灵
There have been no apparition sightings.

673
00:40:58,546 --> 00:41:00,283
我相信
I believe

674
00:41:00,316 --> 00:41:03,756
那场大火净化了那间屋子里的
that the fire purified whatever occult forces

675
00:41:03,789 --> 00:41:06,428
神秘力量
were contained within those walls.

676
00:41:06,462 --> 00:41:08,933
我也认为那些灵魂
And I also believe that those spirits

677
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:11,438
随便你怎么称呼他们
or whatever you want to call them

678
00:41:11,472 --> 00:41:12,874
都已经自由了
are finally free.

679
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:20,957
这是最后一间了 是吗?
And this is the last unit, correct?

680
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:22,059
没错
Yeah.

681
00:41:22,092 --> 00:41:23,796
我买了
I'll take it.

682
00:41:23,829 --> 00:41:25,967
现金全款
All cash.

683
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,670
你要支付一百万美金
You'll pay $1 million

684
00:41:27,704 --> 00:41:29,474
全用现金吗?
all cash?

685
00:41:29,508 --> 00:41:31,077
就你这个年纪大的小姑娘?
A young woman your age?

686
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:34,651
我很抱歉 我能问问你是怎么弄到那么多钱的吗?
I'm sorry, may I ask how you got that kind of money?

687
00:41:34,684 --> 00:41:37,590
我利用毕生所长
I utilized my greatest life skill

688
00:41:37,624 --> 00:41:39,594
成为了一名雇佣杀手
and became a hired assassin.

689
00:41:39,628 --> 00:41:41,465
我现在半退休了
I'm semiretired now.

690
00:41:41,498 --> 00:41:43,669
谁知道呢 没准我哪天又开始重操旧业了?
Maybe I'll go back to it one day. Who knows?

691
00:41:43,702 --> 00:41:45,740
杀坏人既赚钱
But it was lucrative

692
00:41:45,773 --> 00:41:48,979
又有趣
and fun killing bad people.

693
00:41:51,485 --> 00:41:53,021
别那么惊讶地看着我 提姆 我告诉过你
Don't look so shocked, Tim. I told you

694
00:41:53,054 --> 00:41:56,528
我想坦诚相待
I wanted an honest relationship.

695
00:41:59,033 --> 00:42:00,770
好吧 斯嘉丽
Okay, Scarlett.

696
00:42:00,803 --> 00:42:04,444
我会起草合同的 这栋房子是你了
I'll draw up the papers. This unit is officially yours.

鲁比 ?
Ruby?

715
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:39,668
我在这里
I'm here.

716
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:44,076
我终于准备好和你在一起了
I'm finally ready to be with you.

717
00:43:44,109 --> 00:43:46,113
永远在一起
Forever.

718
00:43:50,088 --> 00:43:52,627
但为时已晚 我觉悟太迟
But I'm too late.

719
00:43:53,762 --> 00:43:56,802
你已经永远离去了
You're gone forever.

720
00:44:26,795 --> 00:44:28,097
其他人在哪里?
Where are the others?

721
00:44:28,131 --> 00:44:29,601
我爸爸呢?
My dads?

722
00:44:30,636 --> 00:44:31,772
他们走了
They're gone.

723
00:44:31,805 --> 00:44:33,909
他们选择继续前行
They chose to move on.

724
00:44:33,942 --> 00:44:36,648
我看见他们走了
I saw them go.

725
00:44:36,682 --> 00:44:40,790
他们看上去很开心 至少大多数人是那样
They seemed happy. Most of them did, at least.

726
00:44:40,823 --> 00:44:42,593
你为什么还在这里?
Why are you still here?

727
00:44:42,627 --> 00:44:46,267
我是唯一一个想留下的人
I was the only one who wanted to stay.

728
00:44:46,301 --> 00:44:48,806
为你 斯嘉丽
For you, Scarlett.

729
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:51,978
我知道你会回到我身边
I knew you'd come back to me.

730
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:55,118
真爱不死
True love never dies.

731
00:45:10,081 --> 00:45:13,021
胜利 你逃离了谋杀屋
Success. You escaped Murder House.

732
00:45:13,054 --> 00:45:14,223
哦!
Oh!

733
00:45:14,256 --> 00:45:15,960
所以? 你觉得呢?
So? What do you think?

734
00:45:15,993 --> 00:45:18,565
2.0版本 有你想要的那种精髓吗?
Version 2.0. I mean, does it get the vibe?

735
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:21,705
绝对有 比上一版好多了
Totally. It's so much better.

736
00:45:21,738 --> 00:45:24,076
但我觉得你得让
But I think you need to have a level

737
00:45:24,109 --> 00:45:26,113
那个小孩从至尊女巫那
where the kid gets, like, a magic potion

738
00:45:26,147 --> 00:45:27,684
拿到魔药
from the Supremes

739
00:45:27,717 --> 00:45:29,954
并帮助她烧毁那间屋子那一关 上升个层次
to help burn the house down or‐or something.

740
00:45:29,988 --> 00:45:32,293
我觉得那样会很好 可以加大游戏的难度
I'd like to see that. I think it'd make the game harder.

741
00:45:32,326 --> 00:45:34,096
我 我 已经没钱了 所以…
I mean, I‐I couldn't afford it, so...

742
00:45:34,129 --> 00:45:36,301
如果我们卖掉这个游戏 也许今后可以给游戏做个更新
If we sell it, though, we can maybe do it as an update

743
00:45:36,334 --> 00:45:39,541
‐之类的 ‐好吧 你至少把手柄的故障修好了
‐or something. ‐Well, at least you fixed the glitches in the controls.

744
00:45:39,574 --> 00:45:41,243
‐哦 我有吗? ‐是我修好了故障吗?
‐ Oh, did I? ‐ Did I fix the glitches?

745
00:45:41,277 --> 00:45:42,714
是的 肯定是你修好的
Yes, I insisted on it.

746
00:45:42,747 --> 00:45:44,216
你真的喜欢吗?
You really like it?

747
00:45:44,249 --> 00:45:46,588
这超酷的
It's super cool.

748
00:45:46,621 --> 00:45:47,990
我真的为你感到骄傲
And I'm really proud of you.

749
00:45:48,024 --> 00:45:50,261
谢谢你 宝贝
Thank you, baby.

750
00:45:50,296 --> 00:45:52,834
‐还想再玩一遍吗?‐不了
‐Want to play again? ‐No.

751
00:45:52,867 --> 00:45:55,606
我想我已经在谋杀屋里待得够久了
I think I've spent enough time in the Murder House.

752
00:45:55,639 --> 00:45:57,610
你想去搞点东西吃吗?
Do you want to go get something to eat?

753
00:45:57,643 --> 00:45:59,279
‐好啊 我饿死了 ‐走吧
‐Yeah, I'm starving. ‐Let's go.

754
00:45:59,314 --> 00:46:02,119
但你觉得
But where do you think

755
00:46:02,152 --> 00:46:03,589
所有被困在谋杀屋的灵魂
all of the spirits who got trapped

756
00:46:03,622 --> 00:46:04,858
都去哪里了呢?
in the Murder House went?

757
00:46:04,891 --> 00:46:06,127
那些想留下来的 留下来了
The ones who wanted to stay stayed,

758
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,264
而那些想走的 已经走了
and the ones who wanted to move on,

759
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:10,803
他们可能去了天堂或地狱
they maybe went to heaven or hell.

760
00:46:10,836 --> 00:46:13,207
你觉得他们有可能逃到这个世界吗?
Well, do you think any of them escaped into the world?

761
00:46:13,241 --> 00:46:15,546
‐希望不会 ‐嗯
‐Hope not. ‐Hmm.

762
00:47:51,471 --> 00:47:54,677
