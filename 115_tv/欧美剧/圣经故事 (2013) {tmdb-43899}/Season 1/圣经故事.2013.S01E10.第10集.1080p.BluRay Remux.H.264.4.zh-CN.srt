4
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,900
Good evening.

5
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,800
Some of our late viewers
tuning in.

6
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,600
One of the commonest questions

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,400
that people ask of a producer
of mystery motion pictures is,

8
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,900
"Which is written first,
the words or the music?"

9
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:48,900
In our case, the background
music always comes first.

10
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,100
After it is written,

11
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,200
we sprinkle the score
liberally with sound effects,

12
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,300
and then hire an author
to write appropriate scenes

13
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,600
to accompany the music,

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,400
quiet scenes to coincide
with the somber passages,

15
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,900
and scenes of violence
to synchronize

16
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,300
with the noisier sections.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,400
Finally, we garnish
this potpourri with a title

18
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,800
composed of from
one to four words,

19
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,800
selected because they are
eye-catching and provocative.

20
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,400
And we arrange them
in a manner designed

21
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,500
to titillate and confuse.

22
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,400
Let me show you what one
of our stories sounds like

23
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,500
before it is written.

24
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,000
How fortissimo can you get?

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,400
I trust this has
been educational.

26
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,400
I deliberately
cut that number short

27
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,000
because it was the music
for tonight's story,

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,300
"Alibi Me,"

29
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,400
and I didn't want you
to know how it comes out.

30
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,800
If you haven't
already guessed,

31
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,200
here is the way it begins.

32
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:29,700
ALIBIC ME

33
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,200
No knock on the door?

34
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,900
No "Can I come in please?"

35
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,000
Just no class.

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,600
I want a showdown!

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,800
Now hold it down.

38
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,400
This ain't no candy store.

39
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,400
You're in a high-class office.

40
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,000
Upstairs is a music professor,

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,100
and downstairs,
some legitimate businessmen.

42
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,900
So keep it down!

43
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,500
You got some
explaining to do, Lucky.

44
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,700
Me, I don't explain nothing.

45
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,900
It's tough enough
to hustle a buck

46
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,100
without you
always interfering.

47
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,100
Here, sit down.

48
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,700
Have yourself a nice
salami sandwich.

49
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,900
No? You mind if
I go on eating?

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,800
Look what you made me do.

51
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,400
That's bad luck.

52
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,900
Boy, I sure hate
to spill salt.

53
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,900
Look, I've just come
from Pitkin Avenue.

54
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,200
There ain't a store down there
that'll handle my machines no more.

55
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,000
"All our pinball machines
we take from Lucky," they say.

56
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,100
They say correct.

57
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,000
But from Pitkin Avenue
to Wadsworth is my territory.

58
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,700
I built up the percentages
there, you know that.

59
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,100
When Blackie Hersch got bumped
off, he said I should take over.

60
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,100
You built it up
real nice for me.

61
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,800
And I appreciate it.

62
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,200
Now put the rod away.

63
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,600
You look goofy
holding a rod on me.

64
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,400
You ain't gonna use it,
so put it away.

65
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,500
Lucky, I'm warning you...

66
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,500
Georgie, I can't kill you
and you can't kill me,

67
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,200
and we know why.

68
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,300
Here.

69
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,000
Get a gander of that face
on the front page.

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,500
Go on, look at it.

71
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,700
Imagine a cop like Larkin
getting to be a lieutenant.

72
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,900
Larkin's sure come up
in the world.

73
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,000
Larkin ain't got nothing
to do with us.

74
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,700
Don't be a fool.

75
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,100
Larkin's got everything
to do with us.

76
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,100
He's sort of an insurance
policy between you and me.

77
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,000
What do you mean?

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,400
You got a bad memory.

79
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,700
Even when we
were kids, Georgie,

80
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,000
you hated me and I hated you.

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And every cop
in the neighborhood knew it,

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,700
especially Larkin.

83
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,200
Don't ever forget
what Larkin told us.

84
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,700
"If one of you punks
gets knocked off,

85
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,500
"the one that's left alive
had better have a good alibi. "

86
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,400
That's why I say,
put the gun away.

87
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,700
You ain't gonna need it.

88
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,200
I ain't letting you
take away my business.

89
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,300
Hersch gave me that concession
and I need the dough.

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,100
You need dough?

91
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,100
Go work a cheap con game
on East Broadway.

92
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,400
Oh, if you should happen
to get hungry,

93
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,400
here's a half a buck.

94
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,700
You can drop in any place and get
yourself a nice salami sandwich.

95
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,300
And keep the change.

96
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,600
Lucky, you better
stop ragging me.

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,900
Go away, will you please?

98
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,400
I got a million things
on my mind.

99
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,900
Well, it's almost 4:00.

100
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,000
You know, at 6:00

101
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,800
I got to report to Larkin
for my parole.

102
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,600
If you were to squeeze that
trigger, I'd be missed terribly.

103
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,000
I ain't going to let you
make a sucker out of me.

104
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,800
I already have.

105
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,500
Just today,

106
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,300
I sent you the biggest
lollipop in town.

107
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,600
A present from me to you.

108
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,600
The biggest lollipop in town

109
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,600
for the town's biggest sucker.

110
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,300
"If ever one of you punks
gets knocked off,

111
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,600
"the one who's left alive
had better have a good alibi. "

112
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,200
Hey, Uncle Leo.

113
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,000
Eh?

114
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,300
You and me, we...

115
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,700
We've been through some pretty
rough things together, huh?

116
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,300
And a couple of times, you
needed my help real bad, remember?

117
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,800
Georgie, if I live to be 100,
I no gonna forget.

118
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,300
You know what I say
to the family?

119
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:03,000
I say, "Georgie, he can have
my right arm, up to here. "

120
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,900
Any time.
You ask them.

121
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,500
Well, salute.

122
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,600
Well...

123
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,400
Uncle Leo, I...

124
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,500
I need your help
real bad now.

125
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,100
Oh, sure.

126
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,000
Only, I'm a little broke,
you know.

127
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,700
I had my gallstone out last
summer and the business...

128
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,000
No, no, no, no, no.
It ain't money.

129
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,500
Come here.

130
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,900
What? What? What? What?
Sit down. Sit down.

131
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,300
Look, in case
anybody should ask,

132
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,300
you tell them I was here since
3:30 this afternoon, okay?

133
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,600
3:30? Why?

134
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,900
What's the difference why? You do
me this little family favor, huh?

135
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,700
I don't know, Georgie,
you worry me.

136
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,000
You gonna do it or not?

137
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,600
Look, if I gonna alibi you, I wanna
know what for, family or no family.

138
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,000
Don't make a production
out of it.

139
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,300
They probably
won't even ask you.

140
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,000
But if they do, you just tell
them I was here since 3:30, okay?

141
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,100
You're in trouble
with them hoodlums again.

142
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,600
Your friend Lucky and the guy who
they bumped off, Blackie Hersch.

143
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,900
I told you, you run around with
them, you know what you're gonna get.

144
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,200
Uncle Leo, you just got to
do me this favor. You got to!

145
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,800
Not on you life.
I ain't gonna alibi you.

146
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,700
Why not?

147
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,100
One guess.

148
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,900
His name is Larkin.

149
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,500
So you don't
forget a favor, huh?

150
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,800
Your right arm up to
here, huh? Boy, some uncle.

151
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,600
Look, look, look,
you need money?

152
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,000
I gonna find money for you. I
don't know where, but I find it.

153
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,300
You need food?
I feed you.

154
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,900
You need clothes? The best
flannel, I get it for you.

155
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,400
But no alibi, Georgie.

156
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,600
Now, you excuse me,
I got customers.

157
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,700
Now get out of here,
you little punk.

158
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,400
Just a minute.

159
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,700
Well, for Pete's sake,
look what the cat drug in.

160
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,700
Goldie, I missed you
so much.

161
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,500
It's been a long time, kid.

162
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,400
Such a long time.

163
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,200
I shouldn't touch you.

164
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,500
I shouldn't even
talk to you.

165
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,300
It's been two months.

166
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,000
You wanna know why?

167
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,700
Because you begin to mean
too much to me, kid.

168
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,900
"Don't see her no more,"
I says to myself.

169
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,000
"Just stay away from her.

170
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,800
"She'll wear off. "

171
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,600
You said that, honest?

172
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,600
You mean more to me now
than ever, Goldie.

173
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,000
I couldn't stay away no longer.
That's why I had to come back.

174
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,900
Oh, Georgie, don't ever
stay away again.

175
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,800
No matter what the reason,
don't ever stay away from me.

176
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,400
I'm back now for good.

177
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,200
Do you mean that? Honest?

178
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
Take a look at
my face and see.

179
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,300
I mean it.
Take a good look.

180
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,700
Oh, Georgie.
See?

181
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,200
You satisfied?

182
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,800
Oh Georgie,

183
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,500
it's just been
awful without you.

184
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,500
Not feeling like going out
or seeing anybody,

185
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,400
just sitting around the
apartment and watching TV.

186
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,200
I thought
I'd go crazy.

187
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,100
Well, that's
all over now.

188
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,100
The good times
are back.

189
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,000
You know what
I feel like doing?

190
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,600
I feel like celebrating,
tonight.

191
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,100
Look, why don't you get into your
finest and we'll go out stepping, huh?

192
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,200
We'll go... Dinner, we'll go to a
show, we'll go dancing afterwards.

193
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,400
Huh? How does that
sound to you?

194
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,800
Oh, Georgie.

195
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,800
I've got a new number
I've been dying to wear.

196
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,300
Good.

197
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,700
Goldie.

198
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,100
Has...

199
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,100
Has anybody
been here today?

200
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,900
No. Not a soul.
I was all alone.

201
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,600
Feeling just awful
until you came.

202
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Well, in case anybody should ask
you, you know, not that they will,

203
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,200
but in case anybody does,
would you do me a favor?

204
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,500
Would you tell them
I was here with you all day?

205
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,700
Oh, Georgie,

206
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,000
I'll tell the world
you were here!

207
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,000
From the rooftops.

208
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,500
I don't care who knows it.
Georgie, I love you.

209
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,700
I just love you!

210
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,200
Love you!

211
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,600
Georgie,
please get comfortable.

212
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,900
Viola?

213
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,400
So you can't live
without me?

214
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:32,800
Goldie, now
listen to me, I...

215
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,600
You stayed away because I
was getting to be a habit.

216
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,600
Isn't that the way
it went?

217
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,400
You want me? You want to
spend the afternoon here?

218
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,500
Well, isn't that
just too touching for words.

219
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,500
I meant what I said,
honest... You're a liar!

220
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,500
You're trying to sucker me
into giving yourself an alibi!

221
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,600
Will you please stop
yelling and listen to me?

222
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,600
What I said is true,
I need you...

223
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,800
Sure you need me! Sure!

224
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,800
To give yourself
an alibi.

225
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,200
That's why you came here.

226
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,800
Just so I'll say
that you were here with me.

227
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,100
Now, Goldie I...

228
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,000
You want to use me.

229
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,400
What have you been up to?

230
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,300
What have you done today that
makes you need me like that?

231
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,700
Nothing.
I was out to see...

232
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,200
No, don't tell me.
I don't care!

233
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,700
I don't care
what you've done.

234
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,000
I don't care
what you've done

235
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,500
and I don't care
what's done to you.

236
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,700
An arrest, jail, the
electric chair, I don't care!

237
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,000
You get no alibi from me,
Mr. Wise Guy.

238
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,600
Now get out of here!

239
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,000
Georgie. Good to see you.

240
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,300
Hiya, Timmy.

241
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,600
Sorry I didn't have a chance to
get you some flowers or some candy.

242
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,500
How you doing?

243
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,800
Pull up a chair.

244
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,000
How you feeling,
for real, Tim?

245
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,900
Not bad.

246
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,200
Doctor says
it was a miracle.

247
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,600
How are things with you?

248
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,200
I'll level
with you, Timmy.

249
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,000
I come up by the stairs. I
didn't want no one to see me.

250
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,400
Yeah?

251
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,600
In a spot, Georgie?

252
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,800
Need a favor?

253
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,200
You've come
to the right man.

254
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,100
Favors have been my business
for the past 30 years.

255
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,100
Oh, some fellows call it
ward heeling.

256
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,300
With me, it's a business.

257
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,500
I...

258
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,700
I need an alibi
for the afternoon.

259
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,000
Since 3:00, Timmy.

260
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,400
You got it.

261
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,200
I've got this private room.
No one comes here.

262
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,800
Nurses and orderlies, they
don't come unless I give a yell.

263
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,300
I can have visitors
any time I want.

264
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,100
No one's been here
all afternoon.

265
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,800
Not even my wife.

266
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,000
I'll never forget you
for this, Tim.

267
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,900
You'll pay me back
some day.

268
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,900
You look better already.

269
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,400
When you walked in, I was
going to let you have the bed.

270
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,100
Yeah. Yeah.

271
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,000
So I've been here
since 3:00, huh?

272
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,400
We...

273
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,000
We played gin
all afternoon, okay?

274
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,500
Sure. Okay.

275
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,900
Oh, look, I'll get the
nurse in so she can see you,

276
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,100
and you take
the elevator down.

277
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,500
And, oh,

278
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,900
ask some dumb questions
so she'll remember you.

279
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,600
I'll ring for her now.

280
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,400
There's some cards
in the drawer over there.

281
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,100
Deal a hand out on the bed.

282
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,400
Sure.

283
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,200
Tim!

284
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,200
Georgie!
It's the ticker, Georgie.

285
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,500
You want something, Timmy?

286
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,100
Water.

287
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,500
Here...

288
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,900
Tim?

289
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,600
Oh, don't die now, Timmy! Timmy, you
can't die now! Come on, Timmy! Please!

290
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,900
Don't die now. You can't die
now. Timmy, come on, please!

291
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,500
Say something to me, Tim.

292
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,200
Hello, Mrs. Salvatore.

293
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,500
Hello.

294
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,700
Hey, let me do that. Give me
that hammer, Mrs. Salvatore.

295
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,200
It ain't right a nice woman
like you should be doing this.

296
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,400
Oh, thanks, Georgie. I'm
gonna brain that Casey kid,

297
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,700
if he keeps tearing
this linoleum.

298
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,300
I ain't got money to spend
buying a new linoleum.

299
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,200
Sure, sure.
I don't blame you.

300
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,800
Did you just come in?

301
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,600
Yeah. Yeah, I've just come in,
but in case anybody asks,

302
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,300
especially Larkin,

303
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,000
you tell them I've been
in my room all day, huh?

304
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,800
Larkin? Lieutenant Larkin?
The cop?

305
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,100
Yeah, yeah,
Larkin, the cop.

306
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,700
I couldn't
do that Georgie.

307
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,600
I wouldn't lie to that cop.
Don't count on it.

308
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,100
I do count on it, though.
And you'll do it, too.

309
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,700
Don't shake your head.
I say you'll do it.

310
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,200
You tell Larkin I've been in
my room all day, understand?

311
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,600
Oh, no.

312
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,600
You don't tell him
I'm in all day,

313
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,300
and I'll tell him
about your daughter, Maria.

314
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,500
I don't have any idea
what you mean.

315
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,900
Is that a fact?

316
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,800
No idea at all, huh?

317
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,000
No.

318
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,900
Wait!

319
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,200
How did you know, Georgie?
Tell me, how did you find out?

320
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,100
What difference does it make?

321
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,600
I keep my eyes and ears open,
that's how I found out.

322
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,400
Now are you going
to alibi me?

323
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,300
I don't want any trouble.

324
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm honest and I work hard
to keep my kids honest.

325
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,800
Yeah, sure you keep
your kids honest.

326
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,000
So honest that your daughter yanks a fur
coat right out of a department store, huh?

327
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,400
I made her bring it back.

328
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,900
I marched her into
the store myself.

329
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,000
We gave it back
to the manager...

330
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,100
Sure, sure, I know.

331
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,900
But a crime's a crime,

332
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,700
whether the store
makes trouble or not.

333
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,100
Georgie, you couldn't!

334
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,600
Why, she's only 15.

335
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,800
Her whole life
would be ruined.

336
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,200
She would...

337
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Oh, now, come on, Mrs.
Salvatore, what's to cry?

338
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,300
Am I gonna tell on Maria?
No, of course not.

339
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,200
Oh, please don't
tell anyone. Please!

340
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,900
I'll keep my mouth shut,
just like you want.

341
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,900
And you open your mouth just like
I want and everything will be fine.

342
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,900
Now, if Larkin asks you, I
was in my room all day. Agreed?

343
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,000
And you won't
tell him about Maria?

344
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,600
I won't say a word.

345
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,700
I swear.
Look, I'll take an oath.

346
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,400
All right, Georgie.
All right!

347
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,100
But not a word
about Maria.

348
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,800
My memory is terrible,
just so long as yours is good.

349
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,000
Yeah?

350
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Open up.
It's me, Larkin.

351
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,900
Well, well,
what a surprise.

352
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,900
I'll bet.

353
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,400
And to what do I owe
this great pleasure?

354
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,200
To your friend, Lucky.

355
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,700
Oh?

356
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,200
Anything happen to Lucky?
He's been...

357
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,700
He's been made dead.

358
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,100
No kidding?

359
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,200
Well, what do you know?

360
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,200
Yeah. Tough.

361
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,900
And you've come to give me
your shoulder to cry on, huh?

362
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,000
You're not surprised?

363
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,600
Look, I'm not the only guy
in the world who hated Lucky.

364
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,600
But when you find out
who did it, let me know.

365
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,400
I'll contribute a sawbuck
to his defense.

366
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,100
Save your money, Georgie.
You might need it.

367
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,600
Yeah? How come?

368
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,500
Remember I told you,

369
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,400
if ever one of you punks
gets knocked off,

370
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,800
the one who's left alive
better have a good alibi?

371
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,300
Yeah, the words ring a bell.

372
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:03,100
Come on, give, Georgie.
Where were you today?

373
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,000
I was nowhere.

374
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Is that a fact?

375
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,300
Yeah, that's a fact.

376
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,200
I was right here,
alone in my room all day.

377
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,500
Can you prove that?

378
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,100
It ain't easy to prove you've
been alone somewhere all day.

379
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,400
No?

380
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,700
No, besides,
I didn't see anybody...

381
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,700
Oh, yeah,

382
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,700
I saw my landlady,
Mrs. Salvatore.

383
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,500
Yeah?
Yeah.

384
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,000
Mrs. Salvatore?
Hey, Mrs. Salvatore?

385
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,700
What is it?

386
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,500
Come on in here,
will you?

387
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,100
All right.

388
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,600
Come on. Come on.

389
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,900
This is my landlady, Mrs.
Salvatore. Lieutenant Larkin.

390
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,000
Yeah, yeah. Hello.

391
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,600
Hello.

392
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,000
Sit down, Mrs. Salvatore.
You must be tired.

393
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,600
I won't keep you long.

394
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,800
Were you in all day?

395
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,900
Yeah, the whole day.

396
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,800
Was Georgie in
all day, too?

397
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,200
Georgie? This Georgie?

398
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,400
How many Georgies
have you got in the place?

399
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,100
Yeah. He was in.

400
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,900
Are you positive?

401
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,100
I'm positive.
Sure, I'm positive.

402
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,900
What makes you so positive?

403
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,300
What makes me so positive?

404
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,800
I cleaned the room. That's
what makes me so positive.

405
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,900
And, I pressed a suit
for him later.

406
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,700
That's what
makes me so positive.

407
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,900
Oh, and when I was
cleaning the hall,

408
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,900
the door was open
and I saw him.

409
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,600
And when I was downstairs,

410
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,300
he yelled to me
a couple of times.

411
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,300
Will you swear to this
in a court of law?

412
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,100
I'll swear.

413
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,500
All right. Thank you.
You can go.

414
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,300
Well, that's it then, Georgie.

415
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,100
Meaning?

416
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,100
Meaning, your alibi smells
as far as I'm concerned.

417
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,400
But for the record,
it lets you off the hook.

418
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,900


419
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,300
You George Minelli?
Yeah.

420
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,800
Got a package for you. Rapid
Delivery Service. Just sign there.

421
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,300
Who's it from?

422
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:17,900
Well, a Mr. Moore.
Lucky Moore.

423
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,900
Open it, Georgie.
This I want to see.

424
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,000
Well, what do you know!
A lollipop.

425
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,700
Gee, I've never seen
such a big one.

426
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,700
So you've never seen such a big
lollipop before. Now get out of here.

427
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,700
What are you
waiting around here for?

428
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,100
What do you think he's
waiting for? Tip the kid.

429
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,200
What do you mean, "Tip the kid"?
What do you think I am, the mint?

430
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,200
Okay, cheapskate.

431
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,400
Ain't it always the way?

432
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,000
Five times I come
up and down them stairs,

433
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,900
twice this morning and
three times this afternoon.

434
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,200
Not even a nickel tip.

435
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,500
Wait a minute!

436
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,700
Come here, kid.

437
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,100
You say you were here
twice this morning

438
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,000
and three times
this afternoon?

439
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,500
Sure.

440
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,300
This guy wasn't even in.

441
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,700
Oh, I almost forgot.

442
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,700
There's a message
goes with the lollipop.

443
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,900
To the biggest sucker
in town.

444
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Well, that was a surprise.

445
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,200
The pistol shot Georgie used
to kill Lucky

446
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,500
wasn't in the original score.

447
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,300
But that's what happens
when the musician

448
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,700
who plays the revolver
is allowed to improvise.

449
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,600
Naturally, Georgie was given
life imprisonment,

450
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,700
while the offending musician
got off with a 10-year sentence.

451
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,400
Next time, we plan to bring
you more music and sound effects

452
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,800
and another story
to accompany them.

453
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,100
Good night.

454
00:24:52,400 --> 00:25:02,400
