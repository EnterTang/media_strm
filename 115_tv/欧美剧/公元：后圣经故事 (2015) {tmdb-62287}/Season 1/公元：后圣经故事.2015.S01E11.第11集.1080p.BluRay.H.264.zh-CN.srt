1
00:00:01,541 --> 00:00:03,787
在罗马全境立起您的雕像
Statues of you across the empire.

2
00:00:03,809 --> 00:00:05,443
我还在想神殿里也该立一座
We will have one in the temple.

3
00:00:05,477 --> 00:00:06,644
我们应该预估
We should assume

4
00:00:06,678 --> 00:00:08,145
全境叛乱的情况
there'll be a full-scale rebellion.

5
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,082
我们说的可是神殿的毁灭!
This is about the destruction of the temple!

6
00:00:11,116 --> 00:00:13,417
约亚拿 谢谢你指引我走向耶稣
Thank you, Joanna, for leading me to Jesus.

7
00:00:13,452 --> 00:00:15,386
大比大!
Tabitha!

所有罗马的敌人...
All enemies of Rome...

9
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,257
都会受到惩罚以及镇压 
are punished and crushed.

10
00:00:21,393 --> 00:00:25,062
- 你是?  - 埃塞俄比亚女王的银库总管
- And you are? - Chief Treasurer to the Queen of Ethiopia.

11
00:00:25,097 --> 00:00:27,264
你告诉这个埃塞俄比亚人
You tell this Ethiopian

12
00:00:27,299 --> 00:00:30,134
我们很荣幸
that we would be honored to entertain

13
00:00:30,168 --> 00:00:32,069
款待贵宾
such an important visitor.

14
00:00:32,104 --> 00:00:34,372
那可憎之物即将到此...
Soon the abomination will be here...

15
00:00:34,406 --> 00:00:36,507
一座将掀起血雨腥风的雕像
A statue that heralds eternal war.

16
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,342
你难道不懂我们需要联合
Do you not see that we need to unite

17
00:00:38,377 --> 00:00:39,877
抗击这个庞然大怪?
to fight this monstrosity?

18
00:00:39,911 --> 00:00:41,579
我们不是敌人 雅各
We aren't enemies, James.

19
00:00:41,613 --> 00:00:43,848
若果真如此 那就不要再迫害我们
If this is true, stop persecuting us.

20
00:00:43,882 --> 00:00:45,950
也许这就是结局
This could be the end.

24
00:00:57,529 --> 00:01:00,364
砖头和灰泥

一座罗马大帝的雕像
a statue of the Roman Emperor

36
00:01:22,721 --> 00:01:24,789
就会到达耶路撒冷

37
00:01:24,823 --> 00:01:29,193
他命令将其放在神殿里面
He demands it be placed inside the temple

38
00:01:29,227 --> 00:01:31,095
让我们去朝拜它
and that we should worship it.

39
00:01:38,704 --> 00:01:40,137
放在这里
Put it here.

40
00:01:43,075 --> 00:01:47,645
如果上帝的居所被这样的东西亵渎
If God's house is defiled by this abomination,

41
00:01:47,679 --> 00:01:49,347
他就会离开
he will remove himself.

42
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:54,985
他就会离开这座神殿 离开我们
He will leave the temple, and he will leave us.

43
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,955
我们的尸体就会腐烂
Our crops will rot and fail.

44
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:01,792
到处会充满饥荒和瘟疫
Famine and plague will dance upon the land.

45
00:02:01,827 --> 00:02:04,595
我们的孩子们会挨饿

46
00:02:04,629 --> 00:02:08,966
我们的敌人们会因为我们的虚弱而欢欣鼓舞
Our enemies will delight in our weakness,

47
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:12,336
我们在对抗他们的时候将无依无靠
and we shall be helpless to oppose them.

48
00:02:12,371 --> 00:02:14,105
我们不能允许这种事发生!
We cannot allow it!

49
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:15,940
我们不会允许这种事发生!
We will not allow it!

50
00:02:20,646 --> 00:02:21,879
不要停 不要停
Don't stop. Don't stop.

51
00:02:21,913 --> 00:02:23,881
不要让他们有理由来查
Don't give them a reason to look.

52
00:02:28,286 --> 00:02:31,889
请尝尝吧
Please, uh, help yourself.

53
00:02:31,923 --> 00:02:33,124
很不错 对吧?
Good, huh?

54
00:02:36,094 --> 00:02:39,530
所以我现在和你们说
That is why I speak to you now.

55
00:02:39,564 --> 00:02:43,734
我们一定要联合起来保护神殿
We must come together to protect the temple.

56
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:49,507
所有的党派 所有的教派 所有的城镇 所有的区域...
Every sect, every creed, every town, every region...

57
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:53,044
我们必须要把分歧放到一边
We must set aside our differences.

58
00:02:53,078 --> 00:02:57,548
现在我们需要的是兄弟情义和团结!
Now is the time for brotherhood and unity!

59
00:02:59,084 --> 00:03:04,388
让十万人用一个声音说话!
To let 100,000 speak with one voice!

60
00:03:04,423 --> 00:03:06,357
我们支持你 大祭司
We stand with you, high priest.

61
00:03:06,391 --> 00:03:08,893
去找你们的同胞!
Go to your people!

62
00:03:08,927 --> 00:03:13,331
让他们来支持神殿!
Call them to stand with the temple!

63
00:03:22,107 --> 00:03:23,207
有谣言说
There are rumors

64
00:03:23,241 --> 00:03:25,743
这座雕像是纯金的
that this statue is made of pure gold.

65
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:29,914
显然 大帝的虚荣心真是没有止境
Clearly, there are no limits to this Emperor's vanity.

66
00:03:29,948 --> 00:03:31,782
你应该感激
You should be grateful.

67
00:03:31,817 --> 00:03:34,618
他的狂妄自大让整座城市为之愤怒
His arrogance will enrage the city

68
00:03:34,653 --> 00:03:37,722
并让上千的人加入我们
and bring thousands more to the cause.

69
00:03:37,756 --> 00:03:41,292
我很幸运 可以在这里帮忙
It is fortunate that I am here and able to help.

70
00:03:41,326 --> 00:03:43,427
这不只是偶然
That's not just chance.

71
00:03:43,462 --> 00:03:45,062
这是上帝的旨意
It is God's will.

72
00:03:45,097 --> 00:03:47,498
我们注定会成功
We are ordained to succeed.

73
00:03:47,532 --> 00:03:49,867
是的 我相信
Yes. I believe we are.

74
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:51,469
当我的女王知道我的作为
And my Queen will be thrilled

75
00:03:51,503 --> 00:03:53,170
她一定会很兴奋的
when she learns what I have done.

76
00:03:53,205 --> 00:03:57,341
我们的胜利不光可以让埃塞俄比亚人庆祝
Our victory will be celebrated not just in Ethiopia.

77
00:03:57,376 --> 00:04:01,112
我们会给世界以反抗的信心
We will give the rest of the world confidence to fight back.

78
00:04:01,146 --> 00:04:05,349
我们点起了一团火 将会把罗马烧成灰烬
We are lighting a fire that will burn Rome to cinders.

79
00:04:10,055 --> 00:04:11,656
你做的已经够多了
You've done enough.

80
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,759
寡妇们一会儿会来收的
The widows will collect these later.

00:04:14,793 --> 00:04:18,129
她们让我感谢你的帮忙
They asked me to thank you for your charity.

82
00:04:18,163 --> 00:04:19,497
但我还没干完呢
But I'm not finished.

83
00:04:19,531 --> 00:04:21,766
你的伤口太严重了 大比大
Your wounds are too raw, Tabitha.

84
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,801
你失血过多
You're losing too much blood.

85
00:04:23,835 --> 00:04:24,835
你一定要休息
You must rest.

86
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,637
我感觉好多了
I feel much better.

87
00:04:26,672 --> 00:04:30,041
这让我感觉我在做贡献
And this makes me feel that I'm contributing.

88
00:04:30,075 --> 00:04:31,108
请休息吧
Please rest.

89
00:04:31,143 --> 00:04:32,243
我很喜欢这个
I enjoy it.

90
00:04:32,277 --> 00:04:33,577
我负责缝缝补补
I have my sewing,

91
00:04:33,612 --> 00:04:36,113
让男人们去聊
and the men have their very long

92
00:04:36,148 --> 00:04:38,683
那些重要的事情
and very important conversations.

93
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,860
他们都站起来 为大祭司喝彩
They were all on their feet, cheering the high priest.

94
00:04:49,895 --> 00:04:51,862
我在听他说的时候 我...
And as I listened to him, I...

95
00:04:51,897 --> 00:04:53,664
原谅我 但我实在忍不住想象
Well, forgive me, but I couldn't help but imagine

96
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:54,699
是我站在他的位置上
it was myself in his place,

97
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:58,669
谈论耶稣基督
but I was talking about Jesus Christ.

98
00:04:58,704 --> 00:05:01,572
你能想象这对我们有何意义吗?
Can you see what that could be like for all of us?

99
00:05:01,606 --> 00:05:04,342
想象一下可以说他的名字而不用害怕
Imagine being able to speak his name without fear.

100
00:05:04,376 --> 00:05:07,345
是的 是 不止这些
Yes. Yes, and more than that.

101
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:10,047
想象我们可以从内部影响犹太公会
Imagine being able to influence the Sanhedrin from within.

102
00:05:10,082 --> 00:05:13,618
不需要躲在暗处 不再轻声说他的名字
No more hiding in the dark, no more whispering his name.

103
00:05:13,652 --> 00:05:16,320
你们觉得如何?
Well, what do you say, hmm?

104
00:05:16,355 --> 00:05:18,889
你觉得该亚法会把这一切给你吗?
And you really think Caiaphas is going to give you all this?

105
00:05:18,924 --> 00:05:20,291
是的
Yes.

106
00:05:20,325 --> 00:05:22,026
那他会要求什么作报偿呢?
And what will he want in return?

107
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,161
呃 我们俩可以和他谈判
Well, we will negotiate, you and I.

108
00:05:24,196 --> 00:05:25,196
我不去
Not me.

109
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:28,132
我不会和杀了耶稣的人说话
Not with the man that killed Jesus.

110
00:05:29,868 --> 00:05:32,003
彼得 这是我们把耶稣的教
Peter, this is our chance

111
00:05:32,037 --> 00:05:34,839
传播开来的机会
to take the church of Jesus forward.

112
00:05:34,873 --> 00:05:38,643
不 我得保护你们 不受他的伤害
Oh, no. I have to keep you all safe, away from him.

113
00:05:38,677 --> 00:05:39,810
我们不需要神殿
We don't need the temple.

114
00:05:39,845 --> 00:05:42,680
至少让我和他谈谈
Let me at least speak to him.

115
00:05:42,714 --> 00:05:45,383
我不是新手了 我会向他施压
I am no novice. I will press him hard.

116
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:47,718
我不会再否定我们的主了!
I will not deny our Lord again!

117
00:06:02,504 --> 00:06:04,972
嘿 罗马猪!
Hey, Roman pigs!

118
00:06:06,308 --> 00:06:09,010
等等 等等 等等
Hold, hold, hold, hold, hold.

119
00:06:09,044 --> 00:06:11,012
他们只是小孩
They're just boys.

120
00:06:11,046 --> 00:06:12,213
继续走
Move on.

121
00:06:20,055 --> 00:06:22,323
兄弟们!
My brothers!

122
00:06:22,357 --> 00:06:26,460
兄弟们 你们来此
My brothers, you have come

123
00:06:26,495 --> 00:06:29,563
因你们知道 上帝召唤你们
because you know that God calls upon you

124
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:36,304
来对抗这卑劣之徒 保卫他的神殿
to defend his temple against this abomination.

125
00:06:41,343 --> 00:06:44,612
我们将替天行道
We will unleash a righteous wave

126
00:06:44,646 --> 00:06:48,749
将这神殿腐败的祭司净化驱除
that will cleanse the temple of its corrupt priesthood

127
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:53,721
把我们土地上所有罗马的印记洗涤而去!
and wash every last trace of Rome from our lands!

128
00:06:56,892 --> 00:07:00,061
埃塞俄比亚给了我们武器
Ethiopia has given us weapons

129
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:03,664
也给了我们自制武器的能力
and the means to make our own.

130
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:09,437
我们便有手段铲除这罗马病毒
We have the implements to cut out this Roman infection.

131
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:13,341
却仍缺虔诚之手处置他们
But we need pious hands to put them into,

132
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,875
就是你们的手
your hands.

133
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,245
你们愿与我们一起吗?
So, are you with us?

134
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,024
我看到该亚法派出他的小喽啰来当间谍
I see Caiaphas has sent his little rodent to spy.

135
00:07:30,058 --> 00:07:30,992
不是
No.

136
00:07:31,026 --> 00:07:32,526
我被派来传达消息
I've been sent with a message.

137
00:07:32,561 --> 00:07:34,996
大祭司发来邀请
The high priest extends an invitation

138
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,331
以讨论如何继续共同合作
to discuss how we proceed together.

139
00:07:37,366 --> 00:07:38,533
骗子
Liar.

140
00:07:38,567 --> 00:07:40,568
把他带走!
Take him away!

141
00:07:52,881 --> 00:07:56,150
我想增加耶路撒冷周围巡逻人数
I'd like to increase the number of patrols around Jerusalem.

142
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:58,853
派人上街巡逻已经是一种挑衅了
Putting men on the streets is an act of provocation.

143
00:07:58,887 --> 00:08:00,988
我们在组织势力 不是军队
W... we're a holding force, not an army.

144
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,825
很多人都会帮助隐瞒这个事实
More men will help hide this fact.

145
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:04,859
很好
Very well.

146
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,428
增加一倍巡逻人数
Double the number of patrols.

147
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:15,870
我们能挺过去的
We'll get through this.

148
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:19,841
每次都能挺过去
We always do.

149
00:08:23,612 --> 00:08:26,981
这个痛苦的城市...
This miserable city...

150
00:08:27,015 --> 00:08:28,916
看看你
Look at you.

151
00:08:28,951 --> 00:08:31,652
你什么都没吃
You haven't touched your food.

152
00:08:31,687 --> 00:08:34,722
百夫长的担心毫无意义
The centurion's worries don't help.

153
00:08:34,756 --> 00:08:36,724
我能帮上忙吗?
Is there anything I can do?

154
00:08:36,758 --> 00:08:38,326
说出来 我一定做到
Name it and it's done.

155
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,731
确实有些事
Perhaps there is something.

156
00:08:43,765 --> 00:08:48,035
那个拿撒勒女人 约亚拿...
The Nazarene woman, Joanna...

157
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,537
放了她
Release her.

158
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:52,173
这个女人和你有什么利害关系?
What is your interest in this woman?

159
00:08:52,207 --> 00:08:55,009
只是同情罢了
Only one of empathy.

160
00:08:55,043 --> 00:09:00,214
同情使人软弱 克劳迪娅
Empathy breeds weakness, Claudia.

161
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:01,816
我们并不软弱
And we are not weak.

162
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,819
我关心她怎么...
I don't see how my showing concern...

163
00:09:04,853 --> 00:09:10,625
你不软弱
You are not weak.

164
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:13,861
你听懂了吗?
Do you understand me?

165
00:09:17,232 --> 00:09:18,766
我让你失望了
I've upset you.

166
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,101
没有
No.

167
00:09:20,135 --> 00:09:22,236
你的话很有道理
Your words make a lot of sense.

168
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:23,504
我太鲁莽了
I've been too bold.

169
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:25,039
你... 你才是磐石
You... you are the rock.

170
00:09:25,073 --> 00:09:27,108
你顾虑我们的安危...
Your concern for our safety...

171
00:09:27,142 --> 00:09:28,376
雅各 拜托
James, please.

172
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:31,679
除了比我能说会道 你什么都没做错
You've done nothing wrong except speak better than I can.

173
00:09:31,713 --> 00:09:35,883
也找不到比你更好的人来为我们的事业斗争
And we could not hope for anyone better to fight our cause.

174
00:09:35,918 --> 00:09:38,786
我只想让这迫害结束
I only want an end to the persecution.

175
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,291
我忘不了那人对耶稣的所作所为
I cannot forget what that man did to Jesus.

176
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,964
耶稣在十字架上时
When Jesus was on the cross,

177
00:09:49,998 --> 00:09:52,567
痛苦太过剧烈
when the pain was so great

178
00:09:52,601 --> 00:09:56,037
他的身体扭曲 颤抖
that his body would contort and shake,

179
00:09:56,071 --> 00:09:59,974
他痛声疾呼"父啊 赦免他们
he cried out, "Father, forgive them,

180
00:10:00,008 --> 00:10:03,578
因为他们所作的 他们不晓得"
for they know not what they do."

181
00:10:03,612 --> 00:10:06,347
如果他让上帝原谅他们
If he asks it of God,

182
00:10:06,381 --> 00:10:10,151
也会让我们原谅
then he asks it of us, too.

183
00:10:10,185 --> 00:10:13,621
一定会的
Yes, of course.

184
00:10:19,895 --> 00:10:21,996
雅各会和大祭司交涉
James will talk to the high priest,

185
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,866
他会见证我们所受迫害的终结
and we will finally see an end to our persecution.

186
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,067
我们一起去
Let's go together.

187
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:27,969
不 我去没有用
No. My presence won't help.

188
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:30,638
那你告诉我什么条件你才肯去
Then tell me what terms you'll accept.

189
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:36,377
我对你的判断有信心 上帝会指引你
I have faith in your judgment, and God will guide you.

190
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:39,480
但是我必须离开耶路撒冷
But I must leave Jerusalem.

191
00:10:41,383 --> 00:10:43,251
你要去哪?
Well, where are you going?

192
00:10:46,622 --> 00:10:48,990
去外面
Out there.

193
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:51,125
去传教
To preach.

194
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:02,843
大祭司 我必须提醒你别忘了自己的承诺...
High priest, I must remind you of your own pledge...

195
00:11:02,877 --> 00:11:05,412
停止对那些追随耶稣之人的
An end to the persecution and arrest

196
00:11:05,447 --> 00:11:07,548
迫害和追捕
of those who follow Jesus.

197
00:11:07,582 --> 00:11:09,783
必须马上停止
It must stop immediately.

198
00:11:09,818 --> 00:11:12,986
你在和我谈条件吗?
You're setting conditions for me?

199
00:11:17,525 --> 00:11:19,360
很好
Very well.

200
00:11:19,394 --> 00:11:21,628
我现在就结束
I end it now.

201
00:11:21,663 --> 00:11:23,130
谢谢
Thank you.

202
00:11:23,164 --> 00:11:26,533
那么这一定意味着我们可以公开传教
It must surely follow that we be free to preach openly.

203
00:11:26,568 --> 00:11:30,838
允许传教 但是有限制
There are limits to what's acceptable.

204
00:11:30,872 --> 00:11:32,873
罗马人是很咬文嚼字的
The Romans are a very literal people.

205
00:11:32,907 --> 00:11:35,175
只要把任何提及国王的事当真
They take any mention of kings at face value

206
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,543
他们就管这叫煽动
and call it sedition.

207
00:11:36,578 --> 00:11:39,380
说耶稣是国王 还危及神殿
Saying Jesus is a king endangers the temple.

208
00:11:39,414 --> 00:11:40,881
我们会小心的
Then we'll be cautious.

209
00:11:40,915 --> 00:11:43,851
你们也不要说他是弥赛亚
And you'll refrain from saying he's the Messiah.

210
00:11:43,885 --> 00:11:45,519
但这是事实
But that is the truth.

211
00:11:45,553 --> 00:11:47,788
你们的事实会激怒很多人
Your truth will offend many.

212
00:11:47,822 --> 00:11:50,591
我可能就没法保护你们了
And I may not be able to protect you.

213
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:54,995
我们希望能进入神殿并获得尊敬
We wish to sit in the temple and win respect,

214
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,830
不想冒犯任何人
not offend anyone.

215
00:11:56,865 --> 00:12:00,134
但也不想删改我们传的教
But we will not be censored.

216
00:12:00,168 --> 00:12:01,535
他就是弥赛亚
He is the Messiah.

217
00:12:01,569 --> 00:12:04,204
你对自己的要求一点也不羞愧吗?
You're not shy in your requests, are you?

218
00:12:04,239 --> 00:12:06,640
他是上帝之子
He is the son of God.

219
00:12:06,675 --> 00:12:08,776
他是复活之人
He is resurrected.

220
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,711
他会回来的
And he will return.

221
00:12:12,814 --> 00:12:16,050
好吧 既然说服不了你...
Well, if you will not be persuaded otherwise...

222
00:12:16,084 --> 00:12:17,584
我不会被说服的
I won't.

223
00:12:17,619 --> 00:12:18,919
那就这样吧
Then let it be so.

224
00:12:18,953 --> 00:12:21,722
我相信以后 你们会记住
I trust you will remember my generosity

225
00:12:21,756 --> 00:12:23,190
我的慷慨大方
in the days to come.

226
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,920
成功了
Success.

227
00:12:52,954 --> 00:12:54,154
允许我们回神殿了?
We're allowed back?

228
00:12:54,189 --> 00:12:55,522
是的
We are.

229
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,930
- 进来吧  - 来吧
- Come in.  - Come.

230
00:13:04,432 --> 00:13:06,834
施舍点给穷人吧
Alms for the poor.

231
00:13:06,868 --> 00:13:08,902
谢谢你
Thank you.

232
00:13:10,638 --> 00:13:12,306
大比大?
Tabitha?

233
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,274
来人帮帮我!
Somebody help me!

234
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,378
我们得把她带回家里去
We need to get her back to the house.

235
00:13:17,412 --> 00:13:19,246
玛丽 很抱歉
I'm sorry, Mary.

236
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,148
我应该听你的
I should have listened to you.

237
00:13:21,182 --> 00:13:22,850
不 没事的 我在这里
No, don't worry. I'm here.

238
00:13:22,884 --> 00:13:29,390
玛丽 带我回约帕吧 去见我的家人
Mary, take me home to my family, to Joppa.

239
00:13:29,424 --> 00:13:33,894
求你了 在我死之前一定要再见他们一次
Please, I have to see them again before I die.

240
00:13:33,928 --> 00:13:35,629
你有可能撑不到那么远
I'm not sure you'll get that far.

241
00:13:35,664 --> 00:13:36,764
但我们一定要去
We have to.

242
00:13:36,798 --> 00:13:37,865
那就快点启程吧
Then let's hurry up.

243
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:39,099
我来帮你扶着她
I'll help you take her.

244
00:13:39,134 --> 00:13:40,968
不 必须我来
No. I must do it.

245
00:13:41,002 --> 00:13:42,436
这是我的错
This is my fault.

246
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:46,373
因为我 他们会处决约亚拿
Because of me, they're going to execute Joanna.

247
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,842
我不能再失去大比大
I can't lose Tabitha, too.

248
00:14:10,165 --> 00:14:13,767
约亚拿... 你还受得了吗?
Is it... tolerable, Joanna?

249
00:14:13,802 --> 00:14:16,637
这是上帝的意愿
It's God's will.

250
00:14:16,671 --> 00:14:18,439
我相信他
I trust in him.

251
00:14:20,742 --> 00:14:23,577
这个 我 呃...
Please, I, um...

252
00:14:23,611 --> 00:14:26,246
你得吃点东西来保持体力
You need to eat to keep your strength up.

253
00:14:26,281 --> 00:14:28,749
谢谢你
Thank you.

254
00:14:34,189 --> 00:14:38,892
你的丈夫决定什么时候行刑了吗?
Has your husband decided when it will be done?

255
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,932
并不是所有事都由他决定
He doesn't get to decide everything.

256
00:14:56,344 --> 00:14:58,846
停下
Stop there.

257
00:15:01,883 --> 00:15:03,384
罗马人的走狗
Roman pigs.

258
00:15:03,418 --> 00:15:04,585
放松
Relax.

259
00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:08,155
并且 他们找错了马车
Besides, they are looking in the wrong carts.

260
00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:09,923
你看到他们的人手越来越多了吗?
You've seen how they've increased their numbers?

261
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,625
这很正常
It's only natural.

262
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,927
他们感受到了威胁
They feel threatened.

263
00:15:13,962 --> 00:15:15,462
坐吧
Sit.

264
00:15:20,935 --> 00:15:22,569
你来干什么
What do you want? 

265
00:15:22,604 --> 00:15:25,939
利未让我来的
Levi sent me.

266
00:15:25,974 --> 00:15:30,444
他担心你太... 抛头露面了
He's concerned you're too... visible.

267
00:15:30,478 --> 00:15:32,880
为什么?
Why?

268
00:15:32,914 --> 00:15:34,648
我没跟大家融为一体吗?
Do I not blend in?

269
00:15:38,753 --> 00:15:41,355
那也没有必要故意吸引别人的注意
Still, there is no sense in drawing attention to yourself,

270
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:42,823
在这里更不行
here of all places.

271
00:15:42,857 --> 00:15:45,426
我来给你解释一下
Let me explain something to you.

272
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:49,063
我是一个来访的贵宾 理应被看见
I am a visiting dignitary here to be seen.

273
00:15:49,097 --> 00:15:52,533
我没什么可隐藏 也没有见不得人的事
I have nothing to hide, no hidden agenda.

274
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:54,234
但当我从人们面前消失的时候
But the moment I disappear from view,

275
00:15:54,269 --> 00:15:56,303
就会引起别人的注意
then I draw attention to myself

276
00:15:56,338 --> 00:15:58,972
然后他们就会开始怀疑
and they begin to ask questions.

277
00:15:59,007 --> 00:16:04,478
所以 只要我在公开场合 就没人能把我怎么样
So, when I am visible, I am untouchable.

278
00:16:06,314 --> 00:16:10,117
现在 让我们讨论一下你们的责任
Now, let us consider your responsibilities,

279
00:16:10,151 --> 00:16:11,218
可以吗?
shall we?

280
00:16:13,154 --> 00:16:17,224
那个神殿的间谍会让我的日子很不好过
The temple spy could make my life very uncomfortable.

281
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:22,162
你们能保证他不会造成麻烦吗?
Do I have your assurance that he will not be a problem?

282
00:16:49,324 --> 00:16:53,460
在这里? 给秃鹫喂食吗?
Out here? For the vultures?

283
00:16:53,495 --> 00:16:55,095
那么让我先向上帝祷告
Then let me make my peace with God.

284
00:17:00,869 --> 00:17:03,671
以色列 听啊
Hear, O Israel.

285
00:17:03,705 --> 00:17:05,172
耶和华是我们的神
The Lord is our God.

286
00:17:05,206 --> 00:17:06,607
够了!
Enough!

287
00:17:06,641 --> 00:17:08,609
愿他荣耀之国的名
Blessed be the name of his glorious kingdom

288
00:17:08,643 --> 00:17:09,923
- 长存不朽  - 够了 听见没!
- forever and ever.  - Enough, I said!

289
00:17:09,944 --> 00:17:12,313
你要爱耶和华 你的上帝 与所有...
You shall love the Lord, your God, with all...

290
00:17:27,154 --> 00:17:30,356
大祭司!
High priest!

291
00:17:33,794 --> 00:17:35,361
把我的医生叫来
Bring my physician.

292
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:39,265
坐下 就这样
Sit. That's it.

293
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,534
事情比我们想的还要严重
Things are far worse than we imagined.

294
00:17:44,805 --> 00:17:47,307
他能活下来吗?
Will he live?

295
00:17:49,043 --> 00:17:50,843
他确定他看见了什么?
And he's certain of what he saw?

296
00:17:50,878 --> 00:17:51,978
埃塞俄比亚人的武器?
Ethiopian weapons?

297
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:56,015
那些狂热分子本来只敢想 现在他们敢做了
The zealots have the will, and now they have the means.

298
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,685
他们会把这场危机变成战争
They will turn this crisis into war.

299
00:17:58,719 --> 00:18:02,088
我知道他们会尝试 但从没想过他们有这个能力
I knew that they'd try, but I never thought they'd be able.

300
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,257
我们必须去找彼拉多
We must go to Pilate,

301
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,859
告诉他那些人的计划
tell him about their plans,

302
00:18:06,894 --> 00:18:08,227
让他去处理
let him deal with them.

303
00:18:08,262 --> 00:18:09,262
我们不能
We can't.

304
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,964
我们会被当成同谋的
We'll be damned as collaborators.

305
00:18:10,998 --> 00:18:13,099
在他们眼里 我们已经跟他们是同谋了
In their eyes, we already are collaborators.

306
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,802
狂热分子们想置我们于死地 难道你没看出来?
The zealots want us dead. Can't you see?

307
00:18:15,836 --> 00:18:17,103
我会控制他们
So I control them.

308
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,404
太晚了
It's too late.

309
00:18:18,439 --> 00:18:20,740
他们已经有武器了
They already have weapons.

310
00:18:20,774 --> 00:18:22,842
而这次反抗绝不会成功
And this revolt will never succeed.

311
00:18:22,876 --> 00:18:25,078
罗马会将其镇压 连同我们一起
Rome will crush it and crush us with it.

312
00:18:25,112 --> 00:18:27,447
这你是知道的
And you know that.

313
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:28,681
去找彼拉多
Go to Pilate.

314
00:18:28,716 --> 00:18:31,851
把这座城市从罗马人的屠杀中拯救出来
Save this city from a Roman massacre.

315
00:18:31,885 --> 00:18:34,420
你在建议我们打开大门
Are you suggesting that we open the doors

316
00:18:34,455 --> 00:18:36,656
允许神庙被玷污吗?
and allow the temple to be defiled?

317
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:40,193
上帝会暂时离开神庙 没错
God will leave the temple for a time, yes.

318
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:44,397
而我们也会承担后果
And we will suffer in his absence.

319
00:18:44,431 --> 00:18:47,433
但上帝会听见我们的祈祷
But he will hear our prayers,

320
00:18:47,468 --> 00:18:49,369
假以时日
and in time,

321
00:18:49,403 --> 00:18:53,172
神庙会被净化 上帝也会回来
the temple will be cleansed and God will return.

322
00:18:53,207 --> 00:18:55,141
不
No.

323
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,643
绝不
Never.

324
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,111
绝不!
Never!

325
00:18:58,145 --> 00:19:01,214
我不会成为让上帝
I refuse to be the high priest

326
00:19:01,248 --> 00:19:04,284
离我们而去的大祭司
who allowed God to abandon us.

327
00:19:04,318 --> 00:19:05,785
绝不!
Never!

328
00:19:27,508 --> 00:19:31,177
犹太的未来或未可知
The future of Judea is uncertain,

329
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:34,213
但我带来了上帝的信息
but I bring you God's message.

330
00:19:34,248 --> 00:19:37,217
以耶稣基督之名
Salvation will be found

331
00:19:37,251 --> 00:19:40,119
你们会找到救赎
in the name of Jesus Christ.

332
00:19:40,154 --> 00:19:42,155
腓利
Philip.

333
00:19:42,189 --> 00:19:44,190
腓利
Philip.

334
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:46,426
你怎么来这里了?
What brings you here?

335
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,228
我以为你在耶路撒冷
I thought you'd be in Jerusalem.

336
00:19:49,263 --> 00:19:52,332
我本来想回去找你们的
I was coming back to be with you all.

337
00:19:52,366 --> 00:19:56,002
但你一直都做得很好...
But you've been doing so well...

338
00:19:56,036 --> 00:19:58,371
你在撒玛利亚的作为
Your work in Samaria.

339
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:01,441
更多的人开始追随耶稣
Many more have come to Jesus.

340
00:20:01,475 --> 00:20:04,277
但我怎么可能忽略耶路撒冷呢?
But how can I ignore Jerusalem?

341
00:20:04,311 --> 00:20:08,314
那是我们的家 是所有这一切的中心
It's our home, the center of everything.

342
00:20:08,349 --> 00:20:11,517
耶稣告诉我们把他的信息
Jesus told us to spread his word

343
00:20:11,552 --> 00:20:13,853
传播到世界的每个角落
to the ends of the earth.

344
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:17,290
你的传教至关重要
Your work is vital.

345
00:20:17,324 --> 00:20:20,693
那么 我现在应该怎么做?
So, what should I do now?

346
00:20:20,728 --> 00:20:23,329
去南边
Go to the south,

347
00:20:23,364 --> 00:20:27,333
那条连接耶路撒冷和加沙的沙漠之路
to the desert road that leads from Jerusalem to Gaza.

348
00:20:31,906 --> 00:20:33,640
我们该出发了
We should go.

349
00:20:33,674 --> 00:20:34,807
立刻
Right now.

350
00:20:34,842 --> 00:20:35,942
去哪儿?
Go where?

351
00:20:35,976 --> 00:20:38,278
去加沙的沙漠之路
The Gaza road.

352
00:20:38,312 --> 00:20:40,246
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

353
00:20:42,349 --> 00:20:44,884
你没看到天使吗?
You didn't see the angel?

354
00:20:49,823 --> 00:20:50,957
去吧
Go.

355
00:20:50,991 --> 00:20:52,926
按天使的命令去做
Do as the angel commanded.

356
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,997
我会去往约帕继续传教
And I'll press on towards Joppa.

357
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,997
约帕

358
00:21:10,177 --> 00:21:12,979
你到家了 大比大
You're home now, Tabitha.

359
00:21:13,013 --> 00:21:15,581
我还没准备好死去
I'm not ready to die.

360
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,986
我的女儿啊
My daughter.

361
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,120
妈妈
Mother.

362
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:23,256
她受伤了
She's injured.

363
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,725
在背部
It's her back.

364
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,364
我必须和彼拉多谈谈
I must speak to Pilate.

365
00:21:33,234 --> 00:21:34,801
有什么目的?
To what purpose?

366
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:37,870
你请求我的帮助
You asked me for my help.

367
00:21:37,905 --> 00:21:40,506
我有一条可以阻止一场大屠杀的消息
I have information that will prevent a massacre.

368
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:42,609
那为什么要保密不和我说?
Then why the secrecy?

369
00:21:44,278 --> 00:21:46,679
如果你想要我的帮助...
If you want my help...

370
00:21:48,883 --> 00:21:53,586
因为我必须同时背叛我所恨恶的
Because I must betray both those I hate

371
00:21:53,621 --> 00:21:57,323
和我所爱的
and those that I love.

372
00:22:01,128 --> 00:22:04,464
你应该听听她要说什么
I think you need to hear what she has to say.

373
00:22:14,942 --> 00:22:19,879
狂热分子和埃塞俄比亚人结盟了
The zealots have formed an alliance with Ethiopia.

374
00:22:19,914 --> 00:22:21,581
全副武装
They are armed

375
00:22:21,615 --> 00:22:25,785
准备将卡里古拉的雕像作为导火线
and are using Caligula's statue as a catalyst.

376
00:22:25,819 --> 00:22:32,325
计划发动一场巨大的暴动
They plan to launch a huge uprising

377
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:34,060
来对抗罗马
against Rome.

378
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:42,001
搜查所有人!
Check everyone!

379
00:22:42,036 --> 00:22:45,171
不要挡在路上! 走开!
Get out of the way! Move! Stand aside!

380
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,441
搜查楼梯!
Check the stairs!

381
00:22:48,475 --> 00:22:50,476
我们被出卖了 快拿!
We are betrayed. Quick!

382
00:22:50,511 --> 00:22:52,879
别管埃塞俄比亚的武器了
Forget the Ethiopian's weapons.

383
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,480
我们自己还有
We still have our own.

384
00:22:54,515 --> 00:22:55,615
开门!
Open up!

385
00:22:59,687 --> 00:23:00,887
搜查屋顶!
Check the rooftop!

386
00:23:02,189 --> 00:23:04,224
他们逃走了 搜查那里!
We missed them. Check there!

387
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:10,763
列队!
Line up!

388
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,334
跟我走吧
Come with me.

389
00:23:14,368 --> 00:23:15,368
为什么?
To what end?

390
00:23:15,402 --> 00:23:18,071
这到底是什么意思?
What is this nonsense?

391
00:23:37,338 --> 00:23:40,274
我是女王的银库总管
I am my Queen's Chief Treasurer.

392
00:23:40,308 --> 00:23:43,310
任何对我的伤害都是战争行为
Any harm to me would be an act of war.

393
00:23:49,517 --> 00:23:53,787
输入武器才是战争行为
Importing weapons is an act of war.

394
00:23:54,923 --> 00:23:56,290
可能吧
Possibly.

395
00:23:57,692 --> 00:24:01,495
但你不会想要激怒埃塞俄比亚的
But you are in no position to provoke Ethiopia.

396
00:24:01,529 --> 00:24:04,665
你真是一点都不顾忌自己的口气
You have no regard for your tongue.

397
00:24:04,699 --> 00:24:08,402
我只是想提醒你 你的新大帝
I just want to remind you that your new emperor

398
00:24:08,436 --> 00:24:11,104
似乎不太在意这个地方
doesn't seem to care for this region.

399
00:24:11,139 --> 00:24:15,275
只有你一个人在这 
You are out here on your own.

400
00:24:24,819 --> 00:24:29,556
这么说 你的女王要冒险攻击帝国 是吗?
So, your Queen would risk an attack on the empire, would she?

401
00:24:29,591 --> 00:24:32,025
她会考虑这种机会
She would relish the opportunity.

402
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,061
我不这么认为
I don't think she would.

403
00:24:34,095 --> 00:24:37,297
我不认为她知道这事 是吗?
I don't think she even knows about this, does she?

404
00:24:37,332 --> 00:24:39,433
你过界了
You've overstepped the mark.

405
00:24:39,467 --> 00:24:42,769
她对我绝对信任
She trusts me implicitly.

406
00:24:42,804 --> 00:24:46,607
那么她对你的失望会更强烈
And so her disappointment in you will be all the greater.

407
00:24:46,641 --> 00:24:47,975
把他的东西拿过来
Bring his things.

408
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:55,549
外交的确阻止了我杀你
Diplomacy does indeed prevent me from killing you,

409
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:58,385
但我会写信给你的女王
but I shall write to your Queen.

410
00:24:58,419 --> 00:25:03,657
我想你再也不能回埃塞俄比亚了
I imagine you will never be able to return to Ethiopia again.

411
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:09,496
在你为了她放弃了那么多之后
And after you'd given up so much for her.

412
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:17,271
你的人就留在这里当奴隶
Your men shall remain here as slaves to their superiors.

413
00:25:20,775 --> 00:25:23,010
捡起来
Pick it up.

414
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:32,553
啧 啧 啧!
Tch, tch, tch!

415
00:25:32,587 --> 00:25:34,087
这是什么?
What is this?

416
00:25:34,122 --> 00:25:37,925
来自主教该亚法的一份礼物
It is a gift from the high priest, Caiaphas.

417
00:25:37,959 --> 00:25:43,630
你可以留着 作为你愚蠢的提醒
You may keep it as a reminder of your foolishness.

418
00:25:46,801 --> 00:25:51,872
把这个... 生物赶出我的城市
Remove this... creature from my city.

419
00:26:24,906 --> 00:26:29,042
有些日子我们的信心会被考验到极致
These are days that test our faith to the limit.

420
00:26:29,077 --> 00:26:34,348
当我们感觉到不公正和暴行在心里翻腾
When we feel injustice and outrage churning in our hearts,

421
00:26:34,382 --> 00:26:39,887
罗马士兵充斥着我们的街道
Rome fills our streets with soldiers.

422
00:26:43,758 --> 00:26:46,693
我们还有武器
We still have weapons.

423
00:26:46,728 --> 00:26:49,396
上帝依然支持我们 这是你告诉我的
And God still favors us. You told me so.

424
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:52,566
是的 你说得对 我们的目标是正义的
Yes, you're right. Our cause is just.

425
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,568
但我不会忘记这些的
But I won't forget this.

426
00:26:54,602 --> 00:26:57,437
罗马人威胁我们的神殿
Rome threatens our temple,

427
00:26:57,472 --> 00:27:01,842
将恐惧阴霾散布在我们城中!
throws a shadow of fear over our city!

428
00:27:01,876 --> 00:27:07,014
但你会寻求到光明和拯救
But you will find light and salvation

429
00:27:07,048 --> 00:27:10,617
以基督耶稣的名义
in the name of Jesus Christ.

430
00:27:12,987 --> 00:27:15,489
说得好
Fine words.

431
00:27:15,523 --> 00:27:17,724
但靠说并不能保护神殿
But words won't protect the temple.

432
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:19,927
我说过 我忠于我们的目标
I told you I'm loyal to the cause.

433
00:27:19,961 --> 00:27:21,595
当罗马人指控我们时
And when the Romans charge us,

434
00:27:21,629 --> 00:27:23,230
你会手持刀剑
will you still be loyal then,

435
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,865
保持忠诚吗?
with a sword in your hand?

436
00:27:27,402 --> 00:27:30,370
为了区域的持续和平
For the continued peace of the region.

437
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,906
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

438
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:40,147
我在写一封有意思的小短信给我们亲爱的朋友
I am composing an amusing little note to our dear friend,

439
00:27:40,181 --> 00:27:42,649
伟大的埃塞俄比亚女王
the Great Queen of Ethiopia.

440
00:27:42,684 --> 00:27:45,519
你今天做得很好 克劳迪娅
You did well today, Claudia.

441
00:27:45,553 --> 00:27:47,955
谢谢你
Thank you.

442
00:27:47,989 --> 00:27:51,625
把利亚和她的消息带给你
Having brought Leah to you and her information,

443
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:55,162
我想知道有没有可能 作为回报
I was wondering if perhaps, as a favor in kind,

444
00:27:55,196 --> 00:27:58,732
你可能会考虑释放那个拿撒勒女人
you might consider releasing the Nazarene woman.

445
00:27:58,766 --> 00:28:03,904
首先 叛乱还没有平息
Firstly, this revolt is still very much alive.

446
00:28:03,938 --> 00:28:06,240
第二
And second,

447
00:28:06,274 --> 00:28:10,244
你理应将消息带给我
you bring information to me as a matter of course,

448
00:28:10,278 --> 00:28:12,446
因为你是我的妻子 这是你的责任
because you are my wife, it is your duty.

449
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,981
但是那...
But that's...

450
00:28:14,015 --> 00:28:16,383
我不想觉得
I would hate to think

451
00:28:16,417 --> 00:28:18,318
你将利亚带来给我仅仅是
that you only brought Leah to me

452
00:28:18,353 --> 00:28:21,255
因为你觉得这样会创造机会时说服我
because you thought you might exploit the opportunity.

453
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:24,658
我做了正确的事来阻止战争
I did what was right to prevent war.

454
00:28:24,692 --> 00:28:29,696
而你作为我的丈夫 有责任听从我的建议
And you have a duty as my husband to listen to my advice.

455
00:28:29,731 --> 00:28:33,133
她会被处死 克劳迪娅
She will be put to death, Claudia.

456
00:28:33,168 --> 00:28:34,168
她必须被处死
She has to be.

457
00:28:34,202 --> 00:28:36,670
到此为止
And that's the end of it.

458
00:28:38,473 --> 00:28:40,941
重复给我听
Read it back to me.

459
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,293
约亚拿
Joanna.

460
00:28:59,327 --> 00:29:01,328
跟我走
Come with me.

461
00:29:01,362 --> 00:29:02,863
是时候走了
It's time to go.

462
00:29:02,897 --> 00:29:04,331
你要干什么?
What are you doing?

463
00:29:04,365 --> 00:29:05,899
过来
Come.

464
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:19,580
把门打开
Open the door.

465
00:29:19,614 --> 00:29:22,349
你们知道我是谁 对吧?
You know who I am, don't you?

466
00:29:22,383 --> 00:29:24,852
把门打开
Open the door.

467
00:29:24,886 --> 00:29:26,019
如果你们不开
And if you don't,

468
00:29:26,054 --> 00:29:28,889
你们就得向我丈夫解释不开的理由
you'll have to explain why not to my husband.

469
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:07,461
你对这个女人的兴趣很反常
Your interest in this woman is unnatural.

470
00:30:07,495 --> 00:30:09,263
她对你做了什么?
What has she done to you?

471
00:30:09,297 --> 00:30:10,597
她什么也没做
She's done nothing.

472
00:30:12,133 --> 00:30:15,269
她欺凌他人 并且扭曲他们的思想
She preys upon others and twists their minds.

473
00:30:15,303 --> 00:30:17,337
她妖言迷惑了那个年轻女裁缝
She poisoned the ear of that young seamstress,

474
00:30:17,372 --> 00:30:19,006
现在她正在对你做同样的事情
and now she's doing the same to you.

475
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,208
不是这样的
No.

476
00:30:21,242 --> 00:30:24,278
我只是觉得让她受折磨是错误的
I just believe it is wrong that she should suffer.

477
00:30:24,312 --> 00:30:29,116
所以你就为一个陌生人而背叛我
And so you would betray me for a stranger.

478
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:31,919
她对你下了什么咒语?
What spell has she cast upon you?

479
00:30:31,953 --> 00:30:35,756
你为什么要放她逃走 让我蒙羞?
Why would you want to shame me with her escape?

480
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:40,761
非常好
Very well.

481
00:30:40,795 --> 00:30:42,763
我满足你的愿望
You shall have your wish.

482
00:30:42,797 --> 00:30:48,202
你可以选择现在扼死她
You may choose to set her free now

483
00:30:50,672 --> 00:30:52,940
让她自由
by strangulation

484
00:30:52,974 --> 00:30:55,142
或者让她钉上十字架
or let her go to the cross.

485
00:30:59,147 --> 00:31:00,347
看看她吧
Look at her.

486
00:31:00,381 --> 00:31:02,216
她的一只脚早已踏上了黄泉路上
She's already halfway there.

487
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:05,652
我们只需轻轻一捏即可
All it takes is a little squeeze.

488
00:31:07,789 --> 00:31:09,957
你这个魔鬼
You're a monster.

489
00:31:09,991 --> 00:31:15,696
你认为自己正在从我手里救她
You think you are trying to save her from me.

490
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,965
但我才是在救你
But I'm trying to save you.

491
00:31:19,067 --> 00:31:21,235
别让我做选择
Don't make me choose.

492
00:31:22,904 --> 00:31:24,371
我会选择的
I will choose.

493
00:31:35,717 --> 00:31:37,618
非常好
Very well.

494
00:31:38,787 --> 00:31:41,021
哥尼流
Cornelius.

495
00:31:51,366 --> 00:31:55,803
以耶稣基督之名 我原谅你
In the name of Christ, I forgive you.

496
00:31:59,841 --> 00:32:03,610
就到此为止吧
This ends here.

497
00:32:03,645 --> 00:32:05,679
你明白吗?
Do you understand?

498
00:32:08,183 --> 00:32:09,650
准备
Prepare.

499
00:32:13,154 --> 00:32:14,321
开始吧
Begin.

500
00:33:45,922 --> 00:33:49,191
"他像羔羊被牵到宰杀之地
"He was led like a sheep to the slaughter.

501
00:33:49,225 --> 00:33:51,994
又像羊在剪毛的人手下无声
As a lamb before his shearer is silent,

502
00:33:52,028 --> 00:33:53,896
他也是这样不开口
so he did not open his mouth.

503
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:57,600
他卑微的时候 人不按公义审判他 
In his humiliation, he was deprived of justice.

504
00:33:57,634 --> 00:34:00,502
谁能述说他的世代
Who shall speak of his descendents?

505
00:34:00,537 --> 00:34:04,106
因为他的生命从地上夺去"
For his life was taken from the earth."

506
00:34:08,078 --> 00:34:10,612
你看起来遇到了困难 朋友
You look to have fallen on hard times, friend.

507
00:34:10,647 --> 00:34:12,781
确实如此
Indeed.

508
00:34:12,816 --> 00:34:14,917
我摔得也很重
And I have fallen hard.

509
00:34:14,951 --> 00:34:16,552
如果你需要帮助的话
If you need help,

510
00:34:16,586 --> 00:34:20,122
我过去修过一些车轮
I've repaired a few wheels in my time.

511
00:34:20,156 --> 00:34:21,957
谢谢
Thank you.

512
00:34:21,992 --> 00:34:23,492
请吧
Please.

513
00:34:26,162 --> 00:34:30,699
你刚刚读的以赛亚书里的那一段...
The passage you were reading just now from Isaiah...

514
00:34:34,471 --> 00:34:36,538
给你带来慰藉了吗?
does it bring you comfort?

515
00:34:36,573 --> 00:34:38,841
我原本希望它可以
I had hoped it would,

516
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:42,945
但是我理解起来有些困难
but I am struggling to understand it.

517
00:34:42,979 --> 00:34:45,247
先知说的是他自己
Does the prophet speak of himself

518
00:34:45,281 --> 00:34:47,449
还是其他什么人?
or of someone else?

519
00:34:47,484 --> 00:34:49,518
他说的是一个
He's talking of a man

520
00:34:49,553 --> 00:34:53,389
理解了深重苦难和羞辱的人
who knew great suffering and humiliation,

521
00:34:53,423 --> 00:34:58,360
一个教导我们 通过信仰
the man who taught us that, through faith,

522
00:34:58,395 --> 00:35:03,065
就可以在他身上得到拯救的人
we will find salvation in him.

523
00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:04,400
这个人是谁?
Who is this man?

524
00:35:04,434 --> 00:35:07,369
他是耶稣基督
He is Jesus Christ,

525
00:35:07,404 --> 00:35:09,338
神之子
the son of God.

526
00:35:27,591 --> 00:35:29,258
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

527
00:35:29,292 --> 00:35:32,094
大比大! 非常抱歉
Tabitha! So sorry.

528
00:35:50,547 --> 00:35:52,915
看! 沙漠里的水
Look! Water in the desert.

529
00:35:52,949 --> 00:35:54,683
现在什么能够阻止我受洗
Now what can stop my being baptized

530
00:35:54,718 --> 00:35:57,386
并且把耶稣所说的话传到世界的角落呢?
and taking the word of Jesus into the corners of the world?

531
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,522
你忏悔你的罪行吗?
Do you repent your sins?

532
00:36:00,557 --> 00:36:02,224
我忏悔 我忏悔
I do. I do.

533
00:36:02,259 --> 00:36:05,594
我曾经无视神
I have looked past God.

534
00:36:05,629 --> 00:36:08,664
我曾经骄傲并且自负
I have been proud, and I have been conceited.

535
00:36:08,698 --> 00:36:11,934
我曾经是暴力和仇恨的使节
I have been an ambassador for violence and hate.

536
00:36:13,403 --> 00:36:15,771
那都过去了
That is past.

537
00:36:15,805 --> 00:36:20,676
重要的是你现在选择成为什么人
What matters is who you now choose to be.

538
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:23,445
你准备好了吗?
Are you ready?

539
00:36:28,485 --> 00:36:32,855
你信仰在十字架上死去
Do you believe in Jesus Christ, the son of God,

540
00:36:32,889 --> 00:36:34,623
又在第三天死而复生的
who died on the cross

541
00:36:34,658 --> 00:36:37,393
神之子 耶稣基督吗?
and rose again on the third day?

542
00:36:40,463 --> 00:36:42,431
我信仰
I do.

543
00:36:42,465 --> 00:36:45,067
那么以圣父 
Then in the name of the Father

544
00:36:45,101 --> 00:36:48,304
圣子 圣灵之名
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,

545
00:36:48,338 --> 00:36:51,173
我为你受洗
I baptize you.

546
00:37:06,723 --> 00:37:08,724
所以这是真的!
Then it is true!

547
00:37:12,562 --> 00:37:14,864
通往毁灭的门很宽
For wide is the gate and broad is the road

548
00:37:14,898 --> 00:37:16,232
路很广阔
that leads to destruction,

549
00:37:16,266 --> 00:37:17,700
许多人进入其中
and many enter through it.

550
00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:20,703
通往生活的门
And small is the gate

551
00:37:20,737 --> 00:37:26,509
却很小 路很狭窄
and narrow the road that leads to life.

552
00:37:26,543 --> 00:37:30,045
仅有一小部分人找到了它 
And only a few find it.

553
00:37:43,493 --> 00:37:45,027
玛利亚
Mary.

554
00:37:45,061 --> 00:37:48,364
我答应过大比大不会让她死去
I promised Tabitha I wouldn't let her die.

555
00:37:48,398 --> 00:37:51,333
我以为我的信念足够
I thought my faith would be enough.

556
00:37:51,368 --> 00:37:54,603
她多么善良
She was so sweet

557
00:37:54,638 --> 00:37:57,139
找到耶稣是多么开心
and so happy to have found Jesus.

558
00:37:59,376 --> 00:38:01,977
我要对她的死负责
I'm responsible for her death.

559
00:38:02,012 --> 00:38:04,380
你无需负责
You are not responsible.

560
00:38:04,414 --> 00:38:06,215
这是神的意志
It is God's will.

561
00:38:09,552 --> 00:38:12,421
你可以跟我去看看她吗?
Will you come and see her?

562
00:38:24,868 --> 00:38:26,535
别害怕
Don't be afraid.

563
00:38:26,569 --> 00:38:30,739
这是彼得 我跟你们说过的那个人
This is Peter, the man I told you about.

564
00:38:38,248 --> 00:38:41,150
玛利亚 你跟他们说了我什么?
What did you tell them about me, Mary?

565
00:38:41,184 --> 00:38:43,752
我告诉了他们真相
I told them the truth.

566
00:38:43,787 --> 00:38:45,854
你为什么把我带到这儿来?
And why have you brought me here?

567
00:38:45,889 --> 00:38:50,626
因为我相信你可以帮她
Because I believe you can help her.

568
00:39:47,417 --> 00:39:49,718
就这样!
Yes!

569
00:40:05,802 --> 00:40:07,536
大比大!
Tabitha!

570
00:40:08,805 --> 00:40:11,473
大比大!
Tabitha!

571
00:40:11,508 --> 00:40:14,243
醒来吧!
Get up!

572
00:40:14,277 --> 00:40:17,179
醒来吧!
Get up!

573
00:40:22,118 --> 00:40:25,087
太好了!
Yes!

574
00:40:25,121 --> 00:40:27,223
太好了!
Yes!

575
00:41:01,925 --> 00:41:04,093
他治好了大比大!
He cured Tabitha!

576
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:07,329
彼得
Peter.

577
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:10,766
彼得 谢谢你 谢谢你
Peter, thank you. Thank you.

578
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,766
必须给这座城市一个教训
This city must be taught a lesson.

579
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,800
{\an8}史诗

580
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,766
没有人能够逃脱
No one would escape.

581
00:41:55,364 --> 00:41:55,999
{\an8}难以忘怀

582
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:57,000
我们因为信念联合在一起
We are united in faith

583
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:57,799
{\an8}大结局

584
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,766
把他们全都杀了
Kill them all.

585
00:41:59,364 --> 00:42:00,200
别害怕
Don't be afraid.
