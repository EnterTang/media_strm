1
00:00:01,838 --> 00:00:03,650
找到他 杀了他
Find him, kill him.

2
00:00:03,684 --> 00:00:06,219
能让他回心转意不是要好得多?
How much better if we were to win him back?

3
00:00:06,253 --> 00:00:08,655
他带着人手穿越荒漠来杀我
He dragged men across the desert to kill me.

4
00:00:08,689 --> 00:00:10,357
大帝已经启程离开了
Our emperor has departed,

5
00:00:10,391 --> 00:00:13,493
但他给耶路撒冷留了一份大礼
but he has left a present for Jerusalem.

6
00:00:13,527 --> 00:00:15,262
大帝的一座雕像
A statue of his likeness.

7
00:00:15,296 --> 00:00:17,797
他要求放在神殿里
Which he commands to be placed in the temple itself.

8
00:00:17,832 --> 00:00:20,867
我们说的可是神殿的毁灭!
This is about the destruction of the temple!

9
00:00:20,902 --> 00:00:24,838
欢迎扫罗成为我们信基督的兄弟
We welcome Saul as our brother in Christ.

10
00:00:24,872 --> 00:00:26,172
你们都疯了
You've all lost your minds.

11
00:00:26,207 --> 00:00:27,807
西门
Simon.

12
00:00:27,842 --> 00:00:29,442
- 这是我的错  - 不要去 扫罗
- This is my fault.  - No, Saul.

13
00:00:29,477 --> 00:00:31,778
我必须要弥补
I have to make it right.

14
00:00:31,813 --> 00:00:33,613
我听说如果你想见某人
I've heard that if you want to meet certain people,

15
00:00:33,648 --> 00:00:34,648
就来这里
then this is the place to come.

16
00:00:34,682 --> 00:00:35,682
罗马的敌人?
Enemies of Rome?

17
00:00:35,716 --> 00:00:38,818
那说吧
So, talk.

18
00:00:38,853 --> 00:00:40,654
- 他在这里  - 找到他
- He's here.  - Find him.

19
00:00:40,688 --> 00:00:42,022
嗷!
Oh!

耶稣
Jesus.

31
00:01:26,801 --> 00:01:30,237
至于神 他的道是完全的
As for God, his way is perfect.

32
00:01:30,271 --> 00:01:33,106
耶和华的话是炼净的
The word of the Lord is flawless.

33
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,875
耶稣 你在做什么?
Jesus. What are you doing?

34
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:39,212
我们到处找你
We've been looking everywhere.

35
00:01:39,247 --> 00:01:42,749
难道你不知道我会在父的家里?
Didn't you know I would be in my father's house?

36
00:01:42,783 --> 00:01:47,520
你将永远知道去哪里找我 雅各
You will always know where to find me, James.

37
00:02:03,738 --> 00:02:05,872
扫罗就是这样的人
That's how he is. That's Saul.

38
00:02:05,907 --> 00:02:07,874
你什么话也不能对他说
You can't tell him anything.

39
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:09,976
没错 我们早该阻止他
No, we should have stopped him.

40
00:02:10,011 --> 00:02:11,144
我早该如此
I should have.

41
00:02:11,178 --> 00:02:12,879
他们会乱石砸死他 是吗?
They'll stone him, won't they?

42
00:02:12,914 --> 00:02:14,981
也许大祭司会饶他一命
Maybe the high priest will be lenient.

43
00:02:15,016 --> 00:02:16,616
没可能 该亚法没这么宽宏大量
Not a chance. Not Caiaphas.

44
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:19,085
你们觉得西门也被抓了吗?
Do you think they've got Simon, too?

45
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,554
不然他还能在哪?
Where else would he be?

46
00:02:20,588 --> 00:02:23,056
他们不会把两个人都处死吧 会吗?
They won't kill them both, will they?

47
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,257
不会的
No.

48
00:02:24,292 --> 00:02:26,559
因为我会阻止他们
Because I won't let them.

49
00:02:26,594 --> 00:02:27,861
什么意思?
What do you mean?

50
00:02:27,895 --> 00:02:29,095
我要去神殿
I will go to the temple,

51
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,964
求他们放人
and I will beg for their release.

52
00:02:42,677 --> 00:02:43,977
走!
Move!

53
00:02:53,955 --> 00:02:57,991
欢迎回来 扫罗
Welcome back, Saul.

54
00:03:01,529 --> 00:03:05,532
看看这些人因信仰而团结在一起
Look at all these people united in their faith.

55
00:03:05,566 --> 00:03:08,101
而你却不在其中
And then there's you.

56
00:03:08,135 --> 00:03:10,971
我明白你的愤怒
I understand your anger.

57
00:03:11,005 --> 00:03:14,708
你来找我
You came to me.

58
00:03:14,742 --> 00:03:17,277
你求我让你去
You begged me to let you

59
00:03:17,311 --> 00:03:21,581
抓捕那些渎神者 保卫神殿
attack these blasphemers and defend the temple.

60
00:03:21,616 --> 00:03:23,149
我想引你注意
I wanted to impress you.

61
00:03:24,485 --> 00:03:28,355
但我现在已经明白了真相
But now I understand the truth.

62
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,828
你的老师... 迦玛列...
What would your teacher... Gamaliel...

63
00:03:34,862 --> 00:03:37,097
他会怎么看你的新觉悟?
make of your new understanding?

64
00:03:37,131 --> 00:03:39,565
你想让我做什么?
What do you want from me?

65
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,101
你现在有机会
You have a chance right now

66
00:03:41,135 --> 00:03:45,739
向神忏悔你的罪恶返回正道
to confess to your sins before God and turn back.

67
00:03:45,773 --> 00:03:47,741
回来吧 扫罗
Come back, Saul.

68
00:03:47,775 --> 00:03:50,477
回归神殿
Come back to the temple.

69
00:03:50,511 --> 00:03:53,813
不要背弃爱你的人
Do not betray those who love you.

70
00:03:53,848 --> 00:03:57,517
你正身处宇宙的中心
You're here in the center of universe.

71
00:03:57,552 --> 00:04:00,420
你怎么能离开? 怎能脱离神?
How can you leave? Cut yourself off from God?

72
00:04:00,454 --> 00:04:02,789
你的信仰就在这里
This is your faith here, right here.

73
00:04:02,823 --> 00:04:05,458
我想宽恕你
I want to forgive you.

74
00:04:11,065 --> 00:04:14,034
他们都心满意足
They all look so content.

75
00:04:14,068 --> 00:04:16,836
当然了 他们身处家园
Of course they do. They're home.

76
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:18,905
这里确实感觉像家园
It does feel like home.

77
00:04:20,675 --> 00:04:22,509
但其实并不是
But it isn't.

78
00:04:22,543 --> 00:04:25,278
你也不能宽恕我
And you cannot forgive me.

79
00:04:25,313 --> 00:04:27,881
只有耶稣才能这么做
Only Jesus can do that.

80
00:04:31,586 --> 00:04:33,386
对
Yes.

81
00:04:33,421 --> 00:04:36,823
太好了 大比大
Very good, Tabitha.

82
00:04:36,858 --> 00:04:38,625
好极了
Excellent.

83
00:04:43,497 --> 00:04:45,999
我错过了什么?
What have I missed?

84
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:47,634
跟我讲讲
Tell me.

85
00:04:47,668 --> 00:04:53,707
我们刚刚在说洗衣缝补还有...
We've been talking about washing and sewing and...

86
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:56,443
其他什么都没说
And nothing else whatsoever.

87
00:04:57,778 --> 00:04:59,713
肯定说了
No, you haven't.

88
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,286
跟我讲讲针的故事
Tell me about the needle.

89
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,889
耶稣说"骆驼穿过...
Jesus said, "it is easier for..."

90
00:05:08,923 --> 00:05:11,526
"骆驼穿过针的眼
"it's easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle

91
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,127
比财主进神的国
than it is for a rich man

92
00:05:14,162 --> 00:05:16,396
还容易呢"
to enter the kingdom of heaven."

93
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:20,400
那财主婆呢?
And what about a rich woman?

94
00:05:20,434 --> 00:05:23,436
现在重复你刚说的话
Now. Say that again.

95
00:05:23,471 --> 00:05:26,172
以赛亚的预言已经应验
Isaiah's prophecy has been completed.

96
00:05:26,207 --> 00:05:29,910
耶稣是我们的弥赛亚
Jesus is our Messiah.

97
00:05:29,944 --> 00:05:31,411
他从死里复活
He rose from the dead,

98
00:05:31,445 --> 00:05:34,047
而我奉他的名重生
and I have been born again in his name.

99
00:05:34,081 --> 00:05:35,315
我已经悔改
I have repented.

100
00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:37,617
他也已饶恕我
And he has forgiven me.

101
00:05:37,652 --> 00:05:40,287
我的罪永远被洗去了
And my sins are forever washed away.

102
00:05:40,321 --> 00:05:45,859
所以在我看来已... 你无需
So, it seems to me that there is... no need

103
00:05:45,893 --> 00:05:50,997
无止境地寻求圣洁的仪式
for your endless search for ritual purity,

104
00:05:51,032 --> 00:05:54,768
你的浸礼池 你那套神殿的繁文缛节都不需要
nor your mikvahs, nor any of your temple customs.

105
00:05:54,802 --> 00:05:55,802
不需要?
No need?

106
00:05:55,836 --> 00:05:57,437
对神殿来说不需要
No need for the temple.

107
00:05:57,471 --> 00:06:01,341
对你也不需要
No need for you.

108
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,428
你这是怎么了?
What happened to you?

109
00:06:21,462 --> 00:06:24,464
你这是怎么了?!
What happened to you?!

110
00:06:29,437 --> 00:06:31,972
39下鞭刑会治好你的疯病吗?
Would 39 lashes cure your madness?

111
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:35,408
在监狱里待一个月如何?
How about a month in a cell?

112
00:06:35,443 --> 00:06:38,310
直到你恢复理智
Till you see sense.

113
00:06:38,345 --> 00:06:41,114
我可以把你丢在里面日渐衰弱
I could leave you there to waste away,

114
00:06:41,148 --> 00:06:43,883
直到你被彻底遗忘
until you're completely forgotten.

115
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:46,920
我相信一定会有其他方案
I'm sure there must be another plan

116
00:06:46,954 --> 00:06:49,788
- 不会牺牲掉你  - 躲得够久了
- that doesn't involve you dying.  - Enough hiding.

117
00:06:49,823 --> 00:06:51,590
是啊 但如果他也把你投进监狱怎么办?
Yeah, but what if he throws you in jail, too?

118
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,626
那你就按耶稣教我们的去宣讲传道
Then you'll preach and spread the word as Jesus taught us.

119
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,960
嗯 好吧 我们会试试的
Well, yeah, all right. We'll try.

120
00:06:54,995 --> 00:06:56,555
但如果你走了 谁来领导我们呢?
But if you're gone, who's gonna lead us?

121
00:06:56,563 --> 00:06:58,003
因为我觉得多马无法胜任
'Cause I don't think Thomas can cope.

122
00:06:58,031 --> 00:06:59,199
雅各
James.

123
00:07:00,568 --> 00:07:02,002
是雅各!
It's James!

124
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:17,284
到那时他已经失踪三天了
By this time, he'd been missing for three days.

125
00:07:17,318 --> 00:07:18,285
他的母亲忧心忡忡
His mother was beside herself with worry.

126
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,286
但他竟然在神殿里
But there he was, in the temple,

127
00:07:20,321 --> 00:07:21,888
和一群祭司争吵辩论
debating and arguing with the priests

128
00:07:21,922 --> 00:07:24,157
好像那是世上再自然不过的事
as though it was the most natural thing in the world.

129
00:07:26,527 --> 00:07:28,295
这就是我的梦
I had that dream.

130
00:07:28,329 --> 00:07:32,365
于是我就知道我必须和你们待在这里
And I knew then that I had to be here with you.

131
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,967
我很想你
I've missed you.

132
00:07:36,704 --> 00:07:38,872
他小时候是什么样的?
What was he like? As a boy.

133
00:07:38,906 --> 00:07:42,042
小的时候我们都在一起玩
We all used to play together as children.

134
00:07:42,076 --> 00:07:44,578
他和我们其他人并无二致
He was just like the rest of us.

135
00:07:44,612 --> 00:07:48,548
之后你... 你就开始注意到一些区别
But then you... you'd start to notice things.

136
00:07:48,582 --> 00:07:53,485
比如他的... 与年龄不符的冷静和智慧
Like his... his calmness, his wisdom,

137
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:55,221
还有他的善良
even when he was young, his kindness.

138
00:07:55,256 --> 00:07:58,258
他的眼中闪烁着... 某种东西
He had something... something in his eyes.

139
00:08:00,628 --> 00:08:01,795
我爱他
I loved him.

140
00:08:03,829 --> 00:08:04,898
我非常爱他
I loved him very much.

141
00:08:05,432 --> 00:08:07,232
但那都过去了
But that was then.

142
00:08:07,267 --> 00:08:09,201
现在我想听听你们怎么样了
Now I want to hear about you.

143
00:08:09,235 --> 00:08:12,037
我知道你们都曾被捕入狱
I understand you've all been imprisoned.

144
00:08:12,072 --> 00:08:13,772
有些人还入狱两次
Some of us twice.

145
00:08:13,807 --> 00:08:15,775
但是我相信你们仍然...
And yet, still, you continue...

146
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,744
取得了重大的进展
making great strides, I'm sure.

147
00:08:19,413 --> 00:08:22,048
怎么了?
Well, what is it?

148
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,751
我们昨天折损了两名兄弟
We lost two brothers yesterday.

149
00:08:24,785 --> 00:08:28,188
有个新的信徒扫罗被神殿守卫抓了
A new believer, Saul, was seized by the temple guards,

150
00:08:28,222 --> 00:08:32,559
还有西门... 他昨晚没回来
and Simon... he didn't come back last night.

151
00:08:33,961 --> 00:08:35,762
我必须到神殿走一趟
I have to go to the temple.

152
00:08:37,765 --> 00:08:39,366
去见大祭司长吗?
To see the high priest?

153
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,401
他可关押过你两次
Who has imprisoned you twice.

154
00:08:41,435 --> 00:08:43,103
我们也这么跟他说了
We've been trying to tell him.

155
00:08:43,137 --> 00:08:45,839
我去怎样?
What if I went?

156
00:08:48,409 --> 00:08:50,477
谢谢你 但这是我的责任
Thank you, but it is my burden.

157
00:08:50,511 --> 00:08:52,412
那让我为他们求求情
Well, let me plead for them.

158
00:08:52,446 --> 00:08:54,414
你不了解他
You do not know him.

159
00:08:55,448 --> 00:08:58,151
他会看出你眼底的害怕
He will see the fear in your eyes.

160
00:08:58,185 --> 00:09:01,988
恕我自负 但我也是一个拉比
And, forgive my pride, but I'm also a rabbi.

161
00:09:02,023 --> 00:09:04,925
他总要卖我个面子吧
That should count in our favor.

162
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,462
我已经让你们独自承受这一切太久了
I have left you here to suffer alone for too long.

163
00:09:09,497 --> 00:09:10,864
让我帮帮你们吧
Let me help you.

164
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,817
你们来此有何贵干?
What is your business here?

165
00:10:03,851 --> 00:10:05,852
有何贵干!
Your business!

166
00:10:05,887 --> 00:10:08,588
他听不懂你说话
He does not understand you.

167
00:10:08,623 --> 00:10:09,789
你是?
And you are?

168
00:10:13,494 --> 00:10:15,929
埃塞俄比亚女王的银库总管
Chief treasurer to the queen of Ethiopia.

169
00:10:15,963 --> 00:10:18,098
- 埃塞俄比亚?  - 没事的 百夫长
- Ethiopia?  - It's all right, centurion.

170
00:10:18,132 --> 00:10:20,233
我们把武器留在城门了
We left our weapons at the city gates.

171
00:10:20,268 --> 00:10:23,837
真的吗?
Really?

172
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,872
给我彻底搜
Search it. Every inch.

173
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:38,685
神圣的主 我没有听进
Blessed Lord, I have shut my ears

174
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,654
你的教训
to your teachings

175
00:10:40,688 --> 00:10:44,224
也忽视了你的诫命
and ignored your commandments.

176
00:10:44,258 --> 00:10:47,294
我无视他人的苦难
I have closed my eyes to the suffering of others.

177
00:10:47,328 --> 00:10:48,995
尽管我不配
Though I am unworthy,

178
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:53,033
仍请求你的饶恕 仁慈的神 我发誓....
I ask your forgiveness, merciful God, and pledge...

179
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,934
不
No.

180
00:11:01,075 --> 00:11:02,976
我刚刚看到扫罗了
I have just seen Saul.

181
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,044
我让他走的
I let him go.

182
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,479
他是一个疯子
He's a madman.

183
00:11:06,514 --> 00:11:09,149
他所说的话会让他送命
His words will get him killed.

184
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,283
他是个无名小卒
He's nothing.

185
00:11:10,318 --> 00:11:11,851
- 你不能这么做  - 已经结束了
- You can't do this.  - It's done.

186
00:11:11,886 --> 00:11:13,919
你在示弱
And now you look weak.

187
00:11:20,127 --> 00:11:24,865
让大家知道这只是... 赎罪日
Let the people know it was an act of... forgiveness

188
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:26,967
前夜的饶恕
on the Eve of Yom Kippur.

189
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:28,301
但是在其他任何时候....
But at any other time...

190
00:11:28,336 --> 00:11:29,936
我已经说过了!
I have spoken!

191
00:11:41,382 --> 00:11:44,784
它就要来了... 不知道还有一天还是一周
It's coming... in a day, in a week, I don't know,

192
00:11:44,819 --> 00:11:47,721
但是那可憎之物即将到此...
but soon the abomination will be here...

193
00:11:47,755 --> 00:11:50,023
一座将掀起血雨腥风的雕像
A statue that heralds eternal war.

194
00:11:50,057 --> 00:11:52,993
你难道不懂我们需要联合每一个犹太人
Do you not see that we need to unite every Jew,

195
00:11:53,027 --> 00:11:54,728
每一个小教派和异教团体
every tiny sect and cult

196
00:11:54,762 --> 00:11:57,964
带领他们协力抗击这个庞然大怪?
and bring them all together to fight this monstrosity?

197
00:11:57,998 --> 00:11:59,198
我懂了
Oh, I see.

198
00:11:59,233 --> 00:12:01,867
这是在玩政治 是吗?
This is politics, is it?

199
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:07,574
一边是罗马的意志和它激发的恐惧
There is the will of Rome, the fear it inspires.

200
00:12:07,608 --> 00:12:09,109
一边是我们
And there is us.

201
00:12:11,946 --> 00:12:15,181
我们必须让他们的爱戴多于害怕
We must make them love more than fear,

202
00:12:15,216 --> 00:12:16,816
不然我们都得死
or we will all die.

203
00:12:16,851 --> 00:12:20,387
扫罗说的每一句话...
Every word that Saul speaks...

204
00:12:22,223 --> 00:12:24,224
都是你声名的污点
is a stain upon your reputation.

205
00:12:24,258 --> 00:12:25,825
你没听到我刚刚的话吗?
Did you not hear what I just said?

206
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,294
你没听到我的话吗?
Did you not just hear me?

207
00:12:27,328 --> 00:12:30,263
你是耶路撒冷神殿的大祭司
You are the high priest of the temple of Jerusalem.

208
00:12:30,298 --> 00:12:32,232
你什么时候才有大祭司的样子?
When will you act like it?

209
00:12:32,266 --> 00:12:33,333
我有
I do.

210
00:12:33,367 --> 00:12:35,936
每一天
Every day.

211
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:39,105
你只是太盲目了所以看不到
You're simply too blind to see it.

212
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:43,276
对不起 我昏头了
I'm sorry. I lost my head.

213
00:12:43,311 --> 00:12:45,078
我们担心坏了 你去哪儿了?
We were worried. Where did you go?

214
00:12:45,112 --> 00:12:47,848
在一个客栈 我喝了几杯
There's an inn. I had a few drinks.

215
00:12:47,882 --> 00:12:49,316
然后又喝了几杯
Then a few more.

216
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,650
然后呢?
And then?

217
00:12:50,685 --> 00:12:53,587
我醒过来发现我在一个马槽
And then I woke up in a horse trough.

218
00:12:54,622 --> 00:12:56,556
见到你真高兴
We're so glad to see you.

219
00:12:56,591 --> 00:12:58,058
回来的感觉太好了
It's good to be back.

220
00:12:58,092 --> 00:13:00,794
没有什么好担心的 不要担心我
There's nothing to worry about. Not with me.

221
00:13:00,828 --> 00:13:01,962
什么事也没有
Nothing at all.

222
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,465
他身上没发现武器?
And you found no weapons on him?

223
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,933
没有
None.

224
00:13:06,968 --> 00:13:09,536
祭品和所有的篮子也查了吗?
And you checked the sacrifices, all the baskets?

225
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:10,937
一无所获
There was nothing.

226
00:13:10,972 --> 00:13:13,607
可能他真的只是来神殿礼拜的
Maybe he really has come to visit the temple.

227
00:13:16,377 --> 00:13:19,312
明天是他们的圣日 不是吗?
It's one of their holy days tomorrow, isn't it?

228
00:13:19,347 --> 00:13:21,515
他是一个埃塞俄比亚人 克劳迪娅
The man's an Ethiopian, Claudia.

229
00:13:21,549 --> 00:13:24,918
全世界都有人来耶路撒冷朝拜
People come from all over the world to visit Jerusalem.

230
00:13:24,952 --> 00:13:27,654
你知道他对自己做了什么
Do you know what he'd have done to himself

231
00:13:27,688 --> 00:13:30,490
才能成为女王的银库总管
to become the queen's treasurer

232
00:13:30,525 --> 00:13:34,494
才能永远侍其左右?
and to assure everlasting devotion?

233
00:13:37,698 --> 00:13:41,234
和以前比他只剩半个人了
He's half the man he used to be.

234
00:13:48,843 --> 00:13:51,678
他知道雕像的事吗?
Does he know about the statue?

235
00:13:51,712 --> 00:13:53,013
我没有...
I didn't...

236
00:13:53,047 --> 00:13:55,515
你没问 当然 你不能问
You didn't ask. Of course, you couldn't.

237
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,084
我想见他
I want to see him.

238
00:13:58,119 --> 00:14:02,222
面对面
Face to face.

239
00:14:02,256 --> 00:14:03,957
请他来晚宴
A dinner invitation.

240
00:14:03,991 --> 00:14:07,227
还有让希律和他妻子也来 这样就显得不那么...
And get Herod and his wife along so it seems less...

241
00:14:07,261 --> 00:14:08,862
扎眼?
Obvious?

242
00:14:08,896 --> 00:14:11,598
是的
Hm. Yes.

243
00:14:11,632 --> 00:14:15,901
你告诉这个埃塞俄比亚太监
You tell this Ethiopian eunuch

244
00:14:15,936 --> 00:14:18,805
我们很荣幸款待
that we would be honored to entertain

245
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:21,341
贵宾光临我们的城市
such an important visitor in our city.

246
00:14:30,984 --> 00:14:33,920
你想要什么?
What do you want?

247
00:14:33,955 --> 00:14:36,223
我需要一些东西
I need something.

248
00:14:36,257 --> 00:14:38,692
你可以联系到人
You have contacts.

249
00:14:40,726 --> 00:14:42,896
我只是个做首饰的
I just make jewelry.

250
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,164
我深表怀疑
Oh, I doubt that.

251
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:45,866
你走吧 我帮不了你
You should go. I can't help you.

252
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,033
我不会走的
I will not be dismissed.

253
00:14:47,068 --> 00:14:48,502
出去
Get out.

254
00:14:48,536 --> 00:14:52,139
你怎么看我并不重要
It doesn't matter what you think of me.

255
00:14:52,173 --> 00:14:54,174
我要见你那伙人
I need to see your people.

256
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,542
要是他们知道你让他们失去
And they will not be happy when they discover

257
00:14:55,576 --> 00:14:56,810
见我的机会 还有我提出的条件
you've denied them the chance to see me

258
00:14:56,844 --> 00:14:59,579
肯定会不高兴的
and all that I can offer.

259
00:15:01,282 --> 00:15:04,584
你要什么"东西"?
What is this "something"?

260
00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:07,187
等见到他们我自然会说
I'll tell them when I see them.

261
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:12,459
你要么告诉我 要么就没有然后了
You'll tell me, or you'll get no further.

262
00:15:14,262 --> 00:15:17,430
我想要一个人死
I want a man killed.

263
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,242
扫罗! 你究竟怎么了?
Saul! How on earth?

264
00:15:24,276 --> 00:15:25,676
他们打你了吗?
Did they beat you?

265
00:15:25,711 --> 00:15:26,711
没有
No.

266
00:15:26,745 --> 00:15:27,812
没有
No.

267
00:15:27,846 --> 00:15:29,313
那是雅各让他们放人的?
So James got you released?

268
00:15:29,348 --> 00:15:31,215
雅各是谁? 他...
Who's James? He...

269
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,552
你就平白无故被放了?
You were just freed?

270
00:15:34,586 --> 00:15:36,220
我不知道
I don't know.

271
00:15:36,255 --> 00:15:39,657
我和大祭司谈了话 然后他就把我放了
I talked to the high priest, and... he just released me.

272
00:15:39,691 --> 00:15:41,592
哼 好不可思议
Well, isn't that unbelievably lucky.

273
00:15:41,627 --> 00:15:43,127
西门
Simon.

274
00:15:43,162 --> 00:15:47,298
我们都曾被打 被捕 下狱...被扔石头
We were all beaten, arrested, imprisoned... or stoned.

275
00:15:47,332 --> 00:15:49,700
而这个人就这样被放了?
And this man just walks free?

276
00:15:53,605 --> 00:15:56,506
你到底想要指控我什么?
What are you accusing me of, exactly?

277
00:16:03,982 --> 00:16:07,251
结束了
Well, it's over.

278
00:16:07,286 --> 00:16:09,520
我自由了
I'm free.

279
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:22,099
我叫雅各 来自拿撒勒
My name is James... from Nazareth.

280
00:16:22,134 --> 00:16:23,968
我追随耶稣
I follow Jesus.

281
00:16:26,104 --> 00:16:29,207
你来神殿所为何事?
What brings you to the temple?

282
00:16:29,241 --> 00:16:33,511
赎罪日将至 我们都要饶恕别人
We must all forgive as we approach the day of atonement,

283
00:16:33,545 --> 00:16:34,912
不对吗?
isn't that right?

284
00:16:34,947 --> 00:16:36,581
我应该饶恕你吗?
Should I forgive you?

285
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:39,717
我今天见到了我的兄弟
I met with my brothers today.

286
00:16:39,751 --> 00:16:44,088
我必须假装我没受他们忧虑悲痛的影响
I had to pretend I was immune to their worries and grief,

287
00:16:44,122 --> 00:16:47,592
假装比实际更强大
that I was so much stronger than I really am

288
00:16:47,626 --> 00:16:48,993
都因为你
because of you.

289
00:16:50,429 --> 00:16:53,698
你算什么大祭司 竟让他们这般恐惧?
What kind of a high priest are you to instill such fear?

290
00:16:53,732 --> 00:16:56,934
我必须捍卫信仰
I must defend the faith.

291
00:16:56,969 --> 00:16:59,569
那你做得太好了
Well, you do it too well.

292
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:03,507
我到这里要求释放我的两个兄弟...
I am here to ask for the release of two of my brothers...

293
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:06,209
大数人扫罗和迦百农人西门
Saul of Tarsus and Simon of Capernaum.

294
00:17:06,244 --> 00:17:07,677
我帮不了你
I cannot help you.

295
00:17:07,712 --> 00:17:13,885
西门从没来过这 而扫罗早就被放走了
Simon was never here, and Saul walked free earlier.

296
00:17:15,888 --> 00:17:20,191
他们是怎么跟你说的?
What stories have they been telling you?

297
00:17:20,225 --> 00:17:23,694
我们不是敌人 雅各
We aren't enemies, James.

298
00:17:23,729 --> 00:17:28,699
我们都跪在神前祈求其赐福于我们
We both kneel before God and pray for his blessing.

299
00:17:28,734 --> 00:17:32,570
若果真如此 那就不要再迫害我们
If this is true, stop persecuting us.

300
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,109
好吧 我知道为什么他们派你来了
Yes, I see why they sent you.

301
00:17:39,344 --> 00:17:40,578
跟我来
Come.

302
00:17:43,649 --> 00:17:47,618
我许诺予你们一个圣所怎么样?
What if I promised you sanctuary?

303
00:17:47,653 --> 00:17:49,086
圣所?
Sanctuary?

304
00:17:49,121 --> 00:17:53,991
可以安心祷告的地方 不再有迫害
A safe place to pray, an end to persecution.

305
00:17:54,026 --> 00:17:57,962
与神殿讲和的机会
A chance to make peace with the temple.

306
00:17:57,996 --> 00:17:59,397
为什么?
Why?

307
00:17:59,431 --> 00:18:03,301
如你所言赎罪日将至
Well, as you say, it's nearly Yom Kippur.

308
00:18:03,335 --> 00:18:04,335
还有别的原因吗?
Why else?

309
00:18:04,369 --> 00:18:05,770
去和你的朋友们商量商量
Go talk to your friends.

310
00:18:05,804 --> 00:18:07,638
让他们考虑一下我的提议
Let them consider my offer.

311
00:18:07,673 --> 00:18:10,842
如果他们尊重神殿也能在这里祷告
If they respect the temple, then they may pray here.

312
00:18:10,876 --> 00:18:13,311
但是扫罗除外
But not Saul.

313
00:18:13,345 --> 00:18:14,378
扫罗?
Saul?

314
00:18:14,413 --> 00:18:16,847
这里欢迎你们来
You are welcome here.

315
00:18:16,881 --> 00:18:21,551
我想要团结我们的民族 但是他除外
I'm keen to unite our nation, but not him.

316
00:18:21,585 --> 00:18:22,719
他做了什么?
What has he done?

317
00:18:25,023 --> 00:18:26,891
显然你不了解他
You clearly don't know him.

318
00:18:26,925 --> 00:18:28,559
日久见人心
You'll see.

319
00:18:35,267 --> 00:18:39,670
感谢您在此接见我
Thank you for your kindness in meeting me here.

320
00:18:41,974 --> 00:18:46,077
这是埃塞俄比亚女王
From the queen of Ethiopia,

321
00:18:46,111 --> 00:18:51,983
作为虔诚信徒的一点心意
and... from a humble believer.

322
00:18:52,017 --> 00:18:55,019
多谢贵国的慷慨馈赠
Thank you for your wonderful generosity.

323
00:18:55,053 --> 00:18:56,788
请接受我们的回礼
Please accept in return

324
00:18:56,822 --> 00:19:00,324
这幅经文出自我们的先知以赛亚
these writings by our prophet Isaiah.

325
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:03,161
我会郑重珍视
I will treasure these words.

326
00:19:03,195 --> 00:19:04,662
我们祷告吧?
Shall we pray?

327
00:19:04,696 --> 00:19:08,566
那是再好不过了
Prayer would be wonderful.

328
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,070
你今晚到犹太省巡抚宫殿用膳
You will dine today at the palace of the governor of Judea.

329
00:19:12,104 --> 00:19:13,771
这里还轮不到你
It is not your place

330
00:19:13,806 --> 00:19:17,675
在我的神殿里对贵宾呼来喝去
to give orders to an honored guest in my temple.

331
00:19:17,709 --> 00:19:19,677
没关系
It is fine.

332
00:19:19,711 --> 00:19:25,349
我们已经习惯了罗马人的礼节
We are used to the Roman etiquette.

333
00:19:25,384 --> 00:19:27,085
我会去的
As you wish.

334
00:19:46,002 --> 00:19:47,505
很抱歉如此对你
I apologize for that.

335
00:19:50,342 --> 00:19:55,079
尤其你还是大祭司的夫人
Especially when it involves the wife of the high priest.

336
00:19:55,114 --> 00:19:57,581
但是我们必须谨慎行事
But we must be careful.

337
00:19:57,616 --> 00:20:01,686
你在询问杀人的事
You have been asking about murder.

338
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:08,426
一个渎神者 也是这个国家的敌人
A blasphemer and an enemy of the state.

339
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,627
那就处死他
So remove him.

340
00:20:11,061 --> 00:20:12,397
你丈夫有这个权利
Your husband has the power.

341
00:20:14,266 --> 00:20:16,000
我明白了
The high priest is willing

342
00:20:16,034 --> 00:20:18,269
大祭司放了这异教徒一条活路
to let this heretic live, I take it.

343
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,337
但你不愿意
But not you.

344
00:20:19,371 --> 00:20:21,938
他对我们所有人都是个威胁
He's a danger to us all.

345
00:20:21,973 --> 00:20:23,240
对我也是?
To me?

346
00:20:24,274 --> 00:20:25,408
我很怀疑
I doubt that.

347
00:20:25,443 --> 00:20:27,911
这个人是谁?
Who is this man?

348
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,280
大数人扫罗
Saul of Tarsus.

349
00:20:29,314 --> 00:20:31,582
最近他加入了拿撒勒人的异教
He recently joined the cult of the Nazarenes.

350
00:20:31,617 --> 00:20:34,184
我们和拿撒勒人并无恩怨
We have no quarrel with the Nazarenes.

351
00:20:34,219 --> 00:20:37,889
那好啊 就让那些亵渎神的人逍遥自在
Oh, well, let those who mock God walk in peace.

352
00:20:37,923 --> 00:20:42,193
我不知道你的信仰竟松懈到如此地步了
I had no idea how lax your convictions had become.

353
00:20:42,227 --> 00:20:46,464
我奉劝你不要质疑我的信仰
I would not advise you to question my faith.

354
00:20:46,498 --> 00:20:47,665
不要在这
Not here.

355
00:20:47,699 --> 00:20:49,300
不要一个人
Not alone.

356
00:20:49,334 --> 00:20:53,938
更不要在你蓄意和罗马人勾结的时候
And not when you so willfully share your sheets with Rome.

357
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,141
而且你可以为我做什么?
And what will you do for me?

358
00:20:57,176 --> 00:21:00,144
你想要什么?
What do you want?

359
00:21:02,481 --> 00:21:06,451
你丈夫对大帝的雕像是怎样打算的?
What are your husband's plans for the emperor's statue?

360
00:21:06,485 --> 00:21:09,987
是 我都知道了
Yes, I know all about it.

361
00:21:10,022 --> 00:21:11,789
他会怎么做?
What will he do?

362
00:21:11,824 --> 00:21:13,191
我不确定
I'm not sure.

363
00:21:13,225 --> 00:21:16,027
我们还以为他对你言听计从呢
We all assumed he did whatever you told him.

364
00:21:16,061 --> 00:21:17,095
我只是他的妻子
I'm just his wife.

365
00:21:19,398 --> 00:21:20,898
我欣赏你的回答
I like your answer.

366
00:21:20,933 --> 00:21:24,869
我喜欢你这种巧妙逃避责任的方法
I like the way you swerve to avoid responsibility,

367
00:21:24,903 --> 00:21:26,504
但你愚弄不了任何人
but you fool no one.

368
00:21:26,538 --> 00:21:31,943
亲爱的利亚 我想要从你这得到的是鲜血
What I want from you, dear Leah, is blood.

369
00:21:31,977 --> 00:21:35,613
我想要一千罗马人的血
I want the blood of a thousand Romans,

370
00:21:35,647 --> 00:21:38,449
而你要让你的丈夫和神殿
and you will influence your husband and the temple

371
00:21:38,484 --> 00:21:39,550
将这些鲜血通通给我
to give it to me.

372
00:21:39,585 --> 00:21:41,918
怎么做?
How?

373
00:21:41,953 --> 00:21:47,992
我需要你时 你就知道怎么做了
When I need you, you'll know.

374
00:21:53,966 --> 00:21:57,235
不行 不行 不行
No. No. No.

375
00:21:57,269 --> 00:21:58,970
我有件新的长袍
I had a new gown.

376
00:22:00,305 --> 00:22:01,806
丝绸面料的
A silk one.

377
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,875
大比大现在应该做好了
Tabitha should have finished it by now.

378
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,714
他还没到吧?
He's not here yet, is he?

379
00:22:09,748 --> 00:22:11,649
没 你还有时间 一切顺利吗?
No, you have time. Is everything all right?

380
00:22:11,683 --> 00:22:14,818
我的裁缝还没做好我的衣裳
My seamstress has not completed her work.

381
00:22:14,852 --> 00:22:17,555
我有裁缝 跟我来
We have seamstresses. Follow me.

382
00:22:17,589 --> 00:22:19,223
真为你感到高兴
I'm so happy for you.

383
00:22:19,258 --> 00:22:23,493
我会带你去使徒那接受洗礼
I'll take you to the apostles and have you baptized.

384
00:22:24,028 --> 00:22:25,228
太好了
It's wonderful.

385
00:22:25,263 --> 00:22:28,465
你会感觉到自己的存在... 如此鲜活
You will feel alive... so alive,

386
00:22:28,499 --> 00:22:30,568
从未有过的感觉
like you've never felt before.

387
00:22:30,602 --> 00:22:31,936
谢谢你
Thank you.

388
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:36,306
约亚拿 谢谢你指引我走向耶稣
Thank you, Joanna, for leading me to Jesus.

389
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:49,935
在发生了那么多事之后
You tried to lure my other servants to Jesus

390
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:51,904
你还想引诱其他仆人信仰耶稣?
after everything that has happened?

391
00:22:51,938 --> 00:22:54,172
这都是我的错
This is my fault.

392
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:55,941
我等会再和你算账
And I will deal with you later.

393
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:59,144
现在我们要准备招待贵宾
Right now we have an important guest to prepare for.

394
00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:00,279
你怎么能这样?
How could you?

395
00:23:00,313 --> 00:23:02,314
希罗底 她还是个孩子
Herodias, she's a child.

396
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:04,416
这显然是我的仆人的错
This is clearly the fault of my own servant,

397
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,884
我会和她算账
and I will deal with her.

398
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,120
你想教训你的仆人你去教训便是
You may punish your servant as you wish,

399
00:23:08,154 --> 00:23:09,955
但是这些女孩是我手下的
but these girls, they belong to me.

400
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:12,190
你们俩都从我的家仆中除名了
You are both banished from my household

401
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:14,592
明早前就走
and will be gone by morning.

402
00:23:15,028 --> 00:23:16,561
现在快滚吧!
Now get out!

403
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,303
听着 我知道他对你们都做了什么
Look, I know what he has done to you all.

404
00:23:24,337 --> 00:23:26,004
但是感觉他很诚恳
But it felt genuine.

405
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:27,906
我们该怎么做?
What do we have to do?

406
00:23:27,941 --> 00:23:31,476
只要尊重神殿就好
Just respect the temple.

407
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:33,412
- 就这样?  - 是的
- And that's all?  - Yes.

408
00:23:33,446 --> 00:23:35,681
其它的容后再论
We can negotiate the rest.

409
00:23:35,715 --> 00:23:38,450
我们可以大胆出门
We could go outside without fear.

410
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:41,753
我们可以庆祝节日和圣日
We could celebrate festivals and holy days.

411
00:23:41,788 --> 00:23:44,089
我们为什么需要神殿?
Why do we need the temple?

412
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:47,159
当然我们需要安全感
Of course we want to feel safe.

413
00:23:47,193 --> 00:23:50,028
我不怀疑这一点 但是...
I don't dispute that, but...

414
00:23:50,063 --> 00:23:53,799
既然耶稣已经复活 为什么还要去那?
now that Jesus has risen, why bother to go there?

415
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:56,602
他就在这... 在我们内心 伴我们左右
He is here... in us, with us.

416
00:23:56,636 --> 00:23:57,936
所以为什么要去?
So why?

417
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:00,739
所以神殿是...?
So, the temple is...?

418
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:03,242
旧法的一部分 而旧法已然结束
Part of the old law, which is now been completed.

419
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:04,977
我们仍是犹太人 扫罗
We are still Jews, Saul.

420
00:24:05,011 --> 00:24:06,645
神殿是我们生活的重要部分
The temple is an important part of our lives.

421
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:09,615
我们还有福音要宣讲 雅各
We have message to preach, James.

422
00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:13,752
但是和那一堆石头没有关系
But it has nothing to do with that pile of stones.

423
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,387
你就这么舍弃它了?
You would just abandon it?

424
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:17,856
我只想出去宣扬基督的言语
I just want to go out and spread the word of Christ.

425
00:24:17,891 --> 00:24:19,992
神殿再无关联
The temple is no longer relevant.

426
00:24:20,026 --> 00:24:22,227
这不难理解
It's not that difficult to understand.

427
00:24:22,262 --> 00:24:23,562
那一定是我傻了
I must be stupid, then.

428
00:24:23,596 --> 00:24:24,796
西门
Simon.

429
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:26,865
这个人 这个陌生人
We have this man, this stranger,

430
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,568
一分钟前还想要我们都死光
who one minute wants us all dead.

431
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:31,270
又来一遍吗 彼得?
All this again, Peter?

432
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:34,940
然后不知怎地就毫发无损地
And then somehow gets released by the high priest

433
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:36,842
被大祭司释放
without a scratch on him.

434
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:38,577
现在我不知道他在干什么
Now I don't know what he's doing.

435
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:39,878
你不知道
No, you don't,

436
00:24:39,913 --> 00:24:41,313
所以等你知道了再开口
so you should be quiet until you do.

437
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:48,120
我不相信你们有谁信任他
I can't believe any of you trust him.

438
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:49,388
西门
Simon.

439
00:24:49,422 --> 00:24:51,356
别叫我
No.

440
00:24:51,391 --> 00:24:52,558
西门!
Simon!

441
00:24:56,262 --> 00:24:58,363
趁着还能喝酒 要来点吗?
Some wine, while you can?

442
00:24:58,398 --> 00:25:01,600
等日落你们就要开始斋戒了
Your fast begins at sunset, I believe.

443
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:04,102
我很惊讶你会注意这些事
I'm surprised you pay attention to such matters.

444
00:25:04,137 --> 00:25:05,904
巡抚参与到犹太事务中来
Well, the governor makes a point

445
00:25:05,939 --> 00:25:07,973
表明了他的重视
of getting involved in Jewish affairs.

446
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:11,976
肯定有些你们不常见的习俗我没遵守
I certainly won't be following your obscure customs.

447
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:13,111
得恕我无礼
You'll have to forgive me.

448
00:25:13,146 --> 00:25:15,414
我们在赎罪日会去宽恕
On Yom Kippur, we try to forgive

449
00:25:15,448 --> 00:25:17,916
并且和所有敌人和解
and make peace with all our enemies.

450
00:25:17,951 --> 00:25:19,618
我们是敌人吗?
Are we enemies?

451
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:24,590
我以为这里的都是朋友
I thought we were all friends here.

452
00:25:24,624 --> 00:25:27,693
不对吗 希律?
Isn't that right, Herod?

453
00:25:29,229 --> 00:25:31,997
是的 我们确实相互礼貌
It's true. We do manage a certain civility.

454
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:35,399
尽管你们罗马人习惯
Although, you Romans have a habit

455
00:25:35,434 --> 00:25:36,802
上哪都要树敌
of making enemies wherever you go.

456
00:25:36,836 --> 00:25:39,738
在罗马统治下民族团结
All nations are happily united and at peace

457
00:25:39,773 --> 00:25:41,340
和平共处
under Roman governance.

458
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:42,808
鉴于此地发生的问题
One might doubt that,

459
00:25:42,842 --> 00:25:45,543
恐怕无法苟同
considering the troubles you are having here.

460
00:25:45,578 --> 00:25:48,914
没法平息狂热教徒和拿撒勒人?
Unable to quell the zealots and Nazarenes?

461
00:25:48,948 --> 00:25:51,650
我已经把他们都击垮了
I have crushed them all.

462
00:25:51,684 --> 00:25:52,851
哦
Oh.

463
00:25:52,886 --> 00:25:55,821
恕我来迟
I can only apologize.

464
00:25:55,855 --> 00:25:58,057
等这件长袍花了点时间
But I was waiting on this new gown.

465
00:25:58,091 --> 00:26:00,225
很好看
Very nice.

466
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:03,628
伤感的是 我不得不遣走我一个裁缝
Sadly, I just had to dismiss one of my seamstresses.

467
00:26:03,663 --> 00:26:06,098
你今天遣走了一个仆人?
You dismissed a servant today?

468
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:08,100
是的
Yes.

469
00:26:08,134 --> 00:26:11,536
你不能饶恕她?
You could not forgive her?

470
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,972
遣走她已然是饶恕
Dismissing her was an act of forgiveness.

471
00:26:14,007 --> 00:26:16,341
为什么? 她做了什么?
Why? What had she done?

472
00:26:16,376 --> 00:26:17,609
她...
Well, she...

473
00:26:17,644 --> 00:26:19,578
她在我这里犯了什么罪行?
What crime has she committed under my roof?

474
00:26:19,612 --> 00:26:22,514
算不上罪行 没什么大不了的
No crime in Roman law. It's nothing.

475
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:25,451
她要加入那伙拿撒勒人
She was attempting to join the Nazarene cult.

476
00:26:25,485 --> 00:26:29,521
但是我以为你已经击垮他们了
But I thought you had crushed them all.

477
00:26:29,556 --> 00:26:32,957
- 带她过来  - 遵命 巡抚
- Bring her here.  - Yes, governor.

478
00:26:50,143 --> 00:26:52,778
愿神与你同在
God be with you.

479
00:26:52,812 --> 00:26:54,980
你也是
And with you.

480
00:26:55,014 --> 00:26:58,350
我想问问你一个教友的事
I wanted to ask you about one of your brethren.

481
00:26:58,384 --> 00:27:00,552
一个大数人叫扫罗的
A man called Saul of Tarsus.

482
00:27:00,587 --> 00:27:03,288
他怎么了?
What of him?

483
00:27:03,323 --> 00:27:04,356
他树了几个敌
He has made some enemies.

484
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,492
他就是有这个本事
It's a special skill of his.

485
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:09,660
我们已经开始注意他了
He has been brought to our attention.

486
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,764
我要你帮个忙
I need a favor from you.

487
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,466
跟扫罗有关?
To do with Saul?

488
00:27:14,501 --> 00:27:16,635
我要你带他来找我们
I want you to bring him to us.

489
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:18,837
然后呢?
And then?

490
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,542
然后就跟你没关系了
That is not your concern.

491
00:27:23,576 --> 00:27:26,878
但我们都是信仰基督的兄弟
But he's my brother in Christ.

492
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:28,981
你要考虑的是对我的忠诚
All you need to think of are your loyalties

493
00:27:29,015 --> 00:27:31,450
还有你许下的承诺
and the promises you have made

494
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:33,652
仅此而已
to me.

495
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:40,125
我不能 没有...
I can't. There is no...

496
00:27:42,195 --> 00:27:44,530
想想神殿
Think of the temple.

497
00:27:54,941 --> 00:27:58,310
发发慈悲吧 她们只是女人... 仆人
For pity's sake. They're women... servants.

498
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:01,113
她们在我的家里密谋投敌
They have committed treason under my roof.

499
00:28:01,147 --> 00:28:02,548
这远称不上是投敌
It's hardly treason.

500
00:28:02,582 --> 00:28:05,083
她们让我颜面扫地
They have humiliated me.

501
00:28:09,289 --> 00:28:12,957
我要人当众鞭打她们
They will be flogged in public

502
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:18,395
如此才能让从罗马到埃塞俄比亚举国皆知
so the whole world from Rome to Ethiopia shall know.

503
00:28:18,429 --> 00:28:20,865
你真的觉得大帝会关心
Do you really think the emperor will care

504
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:24,101
如此俗务吗?
about something as tawdry as this?

505
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:26,170
希望他会
Let's hope he does.

506
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:28,540
哥尼流
Cornelius.

507
00:28:28,575 --> 00:28:31,076
押她们到客人那
Escort them to our dear guests.

508
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,512
哪一个应该先受刑?
Which one should I flog first?

509
00:28:34,614 --> 00:28:37,783
不要怕
Don't be afraid.

510
00:28:37,817 --> 00:28:43,555
耶稣会给你力量
Jesus will give you strength.

511
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:49,161
她 只有她
Her. Just her.

512
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:04,943
我对你另有安排
I have something else planned for you.

513
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:27,533
希律 你把叛乱分子带到我的宫殿
You have brought insurgents into my palace, Herod.

514
00:29:27,567 --> 00:29:28,867
我豪不知情
I had no idea. 

515
00:29:28,902 --> 00:29:32,671
你当赞同下面的惩罚
You will show approval for these actions.

516
00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:35,974
你当敬仰罗马帝国的权威
You will admire the power of Rome.

517
00:29:36,009 --> 00:29:37,443
而当这一切结束
And then when this is over,

518
00:29:37,477 --> 00:29:38,844
你当带着妻子离开我的宫殿
you will take your wife and get out of my palace.

519
00:29:38,878 --> 00:29:40,279
明白吗?
Do you understand?

520
00:29:40,313 --> 00:29:41,714
如你所愿
As you wish.

521
00:29:51,991 --> 00:29:54,093
抱歉让你目睹这一切
I'm sorry you have to witness this.

522
00:29:58,832 --> 00:30:03,669
所有罗马的敌人都会受到惩罚以及镇压
All enemies of Rome are punished and crushed.

523
00:30:03,703 --> 00:30:04,770
无一幸免
None are spared.

524
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,480
为了帝国的荣耀
For the glory of our emperor.

525
00:30:42,598 --> 00:30:45,389
我觉得不该相信她
I think it's a mistake to trust her.

526
00:30:45,423 --> 00:30:46,703
她只是个罗马婊子
She's no more than a Roman whore.

527
00:30:46,724 --> 00:30:48,058
她有影响力
She has influence.

528
00:30:48,092 --> 00:30:50,594
一有机会她就会背叛我们
She will betray us at the first opportunity.

529
00:30:50,628 --> 00:30:51,628
我知道她一定会
I know she will.

530
00:30:51,663 --> 00:30:54,598
也许吧 但那也是我们要承担的风险
Possibly, but that's a risk we have to take.

531
00:30:54,632 --> 00:30:56,567
伊娃 这是我们唯一的机会
We have this one chance, Eva.

532
00:30:56,601 --> 00:30:59,937
把我们的城市从罗马的暴政中拯救出来
One glorious opportunity to free our city from Roman rule.

533
00:30:59,971 --> 00:31:01,538
- 那个雕像...  - 我知道
- That statue...  - I know.

534
00:31:02,573 --> 00:31:04,974
对不起 但我们要杀的是一个
I'm sorry, but we are murdering a man

535
00:31:05,008 --> 00:31:07,376
没有罪过也无冒犯的人
who has not sinned or caused offense.

536
00:31:07,411 --> 00:31:09,011
他都不是罗马人
He is no Roman.

537
00:31:09,046 --> 00:31:12,982
在我看来只是有些大嘴巴
Just a loudmouth, as far as I can tell.

538
00:31:13,016 --> 00:31:14,450
我得走了
I have to go.

539
00:31:14,485 --> 00:31:17,687
你怎么不去听听这个人传教?
Why don't you go and listen to this man preach?

540
00:31:17,721 --> 00:31:21,224
看看他是不是真如利亚说的那样糟
See if he really is as bad as Leah makes him out to be.

541
00:31:45,784 --> 00:31:47,284
你好
Shalom.

542
00:31:53,558 --> 00:31:56,126
你不能那么做
You can't do that.

543
00:31:56,161 --> 00:31:57,461
她们不过是女仆
They were housemaids.

544
00:31:57,495 --> 00:31:59,496
你不能像那样跟我争执
You can't argue with me like that,

545
00:31:59,531 --> 00:32:02,166
也不能当众反对我
and you can't show your disapproval in public.

546
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,001
我没说话
I didn't say word.

547
00:32:04,035 --> 00:32:06,169
你的脸说明一切
Your face.

548
00:32:10,108 --> 00:32:12,575
好吧 如果我的表现不像你想的
Well, I'm sorry if my performance

549
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:14,811
那样完美 我向你道歉
wasn't as polished as you might have liked.

550
00:32:16,981 --> 00:32:19,616
不要有下次
Don't do it again.

551
00:32:20,051 --> 00:32:23,720
另一个会怎样?
What will happen to the other one?

552
00:32:23,755 --> 00:32:25,456
我不知道
I don't know.

553
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:28,692
还没想好怎样才更有价值
I haven't worked out how to make it count.

554
00:32:28,726 --> 00:32:30,794
什么更有价值?
Make what count?

555
00:32:30,829 --> 00:32:32,863
她的死
Her death.

556
00:32:36,868 --> 00:32:37,901
约亚拿!
Joanna!

557
00:32:37,936 --> 00:32:39,603
我的爱人
My love.

558
00:32:39,637 --> 00:32:41,138
我的爱人
My love.

559
00:32:42,807 --> 00:32:44,108
不要哭
Don't cry.

560
00:32:46,911 --> 00:32:48,212
我现在很平静
I am at peace.

561
00:32:49,781 --> 00:32:52,116
现在没什么能伤害我
Nothing can hurt me now.

562
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:55,152
你是最棒的丈夫
You were the best husband.

563
00:32:57,689 --> 00:33:01,091
为我们有过的一切感到幸福吧
So be happy for what we had.

564
00:33:13,171 --> 00:33:15,172
你们所有人都会重生...
You can all be born again...

565
00:33:15,206 --> 00:33:20,978
与神修好 从神殿的专制中解放
Reconciled with God, freed from the temple's tyranny.

566
00:33:21,012 --> 00:33:24,046
有一种新的生活 新的自由
There is a new life, a new freedom,

567
00:33:24,081 --> 00:33:27,550
从耶稣基督的爱中来
and it comes from the love of Jesus Christ.

568
00:33:27,585 --> 00:33:31,521
不要害怕他的话语
You must not be afraid of his message.

569
00:33:31,555 --> 00:33:35,092
耶稣并不是来废除律法的 而是来完全律法
Jesus came not to abolish the law, but to fulfill it.

570
00:33:35,126 --> 00:33:38,328
所有我们之前学到的
All that we have been taught before

571
00:33:38,363 --> 00:33:41,465
引导我们来到这一刻
has led us to this very moment.

572
00:33:41,499 --> 00:33:42,733
你怎么看?
What did you think?

573
00:33:42,767 --> 00:33:46,136
现在 现在 就是现在...
Now, now, now is the time...

574
00:33:46,171 --> 00:33:48,705
这是你们的异教所信仰的吗?
Is this what your cult believes?

575
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,240
一部分吧
Some of it.

576
00:33:50,275 --> 00:33:55,279
他说的那些话会毁掉你们的新教会
He will destroy your new church with those words.

577
00:33:55,313 --> 00:33:58,148
我跟利未说就让他去吧
I told Levi we should leave him alone,

578
00:33:58,382 --> 00:34:00,551
专心我们自己的事情就好
concentrate on our own affairs.

579
00:34:01,285 --> 00:34:02,619
但现在不行了
But not now.

580
00:34:02,654 --> 00:34:04,655
他不能这么威胁神殿
He can't threaten the temple like that.

581
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,293
他死了对我们都有好处
It would help us all if he were gone.

582
00:34:10,327 --> 00:34:14,097
日落时把扫罗单独带到客栈
Deliver Saul alone to the inn at sunset.

583
00:34:14,131 --> 00:34:16,099
赎罪日一结束我们就完成剩下的事
Once Yom Kippur has finished, we'll do the rest.

584
00:34:16,134 --> 00:34:19,002
你现在是我们这边的
You are with us now.

585
00:34:19,036 --> 00:34:21,605
是我这边的
You are with me.

586
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,906
对吗?
Yes?

587
00:34:26,277 --> 00:34:27,511
对不起
I'm sorry.

588
00:34:27,545 --> 00:34:29,713
非常 非常抱歉
I'm so, so sorry.

589
00:34:37,222 --> 00:34:39,690
挨打的该是我
It should have been me.

590
00:34:39,724 --> 00:34:41,325
没错 
Yes, it should.

591
00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:45,729
你知道事情会这样
You knew what would happen.

592
00:34:45,763 --> 00:34:49,399
这全是我一个人的错
The fault is mine alone.

593
00:34:53,538 --> 00:34:59,009
这里是给她的一些钱和草药
Here is some money and herbs and medicine for her.

594
00:34:59,043 --> 00:35:01,645
你有去处吗?
Do you have somewhere you can go?

595
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,083
有
Yes.

596
00:35:07,718 --> 00:35:09,687
巡抚正忙着处理政务
The governor is busy with affairs of state.

597
00:35:09,721 --> 00:35:14,691
如果你现在走 他就见不到你
If you go now, he will not see you.

598
00:35:14,726 --> 00:35:19,563
也不会知道我参与其中
And he will not know of my involvement in this.

599
00:35:19,597 --> 00:35:20,864
谢谢你
Thank you.

600
00:35:23,899 --> 00:35:25,735
我还能怎么做呢?
What else could I do?

601
00:35:27,705 --> 00:35:31,442
约亚拿怎么办?
And what of Joanna?

602
00:35:37,082 --> 00:35:38,615
走吧
Go now.

603
00:35:41,685 --> 00:35:42,920
祝你安好
I wish you well.

604
00:36:13,428 --> 00:36:16,196
发生什么事了?
What's happened?

605
00:36:16,231 --> 00:36:18,932
请你别哭
Please don't cry.

606
00:36:20,535 --> 00:36:25,839
因为如果神与我们同在 谁能与我们对抗?
Because if God is with us, who can be against us?

607
00:36:25,874 --> 00:36:28,775
而神就与你同在 大比大
And God is with you, Tabitha.

608
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,777
任何事都不能把你
Nothing can separate you

609
00:36:30,812 --> 00:36:33,747
和基督的爱分离... 任何事
from the love of Christ... Nothing.

610
00:36:33,781 --> 00:36:41,021
生不能 死不能 天使抑或恶魔都不能
Not life, not death, nor angels or demons.

611
00:36:41,055 --> 00:36:44,158
人不能 权柄不能
No one, no power.

612
00:36:44,192 --> 00:36:49,263
没有任何权力能把我们同主的爱分开
No authority can separate us from the love of God.

613
00:36:49,297 --> 00:36:52,699
而那爱就是耶稣基督
And that love is Jesus Christ.

614
00:37:01,242 --> 00:37:04,645
是彼拉多下令打她的
She was beaten on Pilate's orders.

615
00:37:09,217 --> 00:37:11,552
我得告诉你一件事
I need to tell you something.

616
00:37:24,499 --> 00:37:27,901
我把整个民族的罪都放在山羊之上
I lay all of nation's sins upon this goat.

617
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:31,839
让他逃回荒野
Let him escape into the wilderness

618
00:37:31,873 --> 00:37:35,109
带走我们所有的罪!
and take all our sins away!

619
00:37:35,143 --> 00:37:37,277
走吧!
Away!

620
00:37:45,453 --> 00:37:47,788
对不起 我不是恨扫罗
I'm so sorry. I don't hate Saul.

621
00:37:47,822 --> 00:37:49,189
不是这样的
It's not like that.

622
00:37:49,224 --> 00:37:51,291
我只是想保护神殿
I just wanted to protect the temple.

623
00:37:51,326 --> 00:37:53,093
你动摇了 但还没走远
You slipped, but not that far.

624
00:37:53,127 --> 00:37:55,028
所以我们该怎么做?
So, what do we do?

625
00:37:55,063 --> 00:37:58,030
那些狂热信徒知道他在哪吗?
Do the zealots know where he's staying?

626
00:37:59,767 --> 00:38:02,368
那他暂时安全
Then he's safe here for now.

627
00:38:02,402 --> 00:38:04,037
不 这可不一定
No. We don't know that.

628
00:38:04,071 --> 00:38:06,239
他... 他对自己是种危险
He is a... a danger to himself,

629
00:38:06,273 --> 00:38:08,008
所以他对我们也是危险
and therefore he is a danger to us.

630
00:38:08,042 --> 00:38:11,044
我们对耶稣的信仰本身就危险
Our belief in Jesus is the danger.

631
00:38:11,078 --> 00:38:13,009
不 该亚法愿与我们和平共处后就不是了
No. Not now that Caiaphas has offered us peace.

632
00:38:13,014 --> 00:38:16,182
我认为扫罗才是问题所在
I think that Saul is the problem.

633
00:38:16,217 --> 00:38:18,685
他的观点太激进了 会让我们分崩离析
His views are too radical. They will pull us apart.

634
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:20,120
西门的举动就是证明
Simon's actions are proof of this.

635
00:38:20,155 --> 00:38:22,622
你误解了他的热情
You misunderstand his passion.

636
00:38:22,757 --> 00:38:24,908
我们知道大祭司对他的看法
We know how the High Priest feels about him.

637
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,260
他告诉我的 现在又有狂热信徒这事
He told me so. And the zealots.

638
00:38:27,295 --> 00:38:29,262
他被赶出了大马士革
He was chased out of Damascus.

639
00:38:29,296 --> 00:38:31,097
他是拿我们所有人的命在冒险
He risks all of our lives.

640
00:38:31,132 --> 00:38:32,799
所以你想怎么样?
So what do you suggest?

641
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:36,369
他们让你怎么做?
What did they tell you to do?

642
00:38:36,404 --> 00:38:40,000
等赎罪日结束我得带他到
I have to take him to an inn in the lower city

643
00:38:40,074 --> 00:38:42,075
下城的一家客栈
as soon as Yom Kippur ends.

644
00:38:42,109 --> 00:38:45,045
好 所以我们日落前还有时间
Right, so we have till the end of the day.

645
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:47,180
做什么? 他是我们的一员
To do what? He's one of us.

646
00:38:47,214 --> 00:38:49,000
你到底在计划什么?
So what on earth are you planning?

647
00:38:55,023 --> 00:38:58,000
西门回来了 所以很明显
Simon's back, which obviously means

648
00:38:58,023 --> 00:39:00,500
你们都在谈论我的事情
you're all talking about me.

649
00:39:38,066 --> 00:39:40,267
祝你成功
We wish you every success.

650
00:39:40,302 --> 00:39:42,903
- 啊  - 我听说腓力
- Ah.  - I hear Philip has made

651
00:39:42,937 --> 00:39:45,372
在撒玛利亚有了大进展
some great progress in Samaria.

652
00:39:45,407 --> 00:39:46,907
我在耶路撒冷能做得更好
I could do better right here in Jerusalem.

653
00:39:46,941 --> 00:39:48,542
我认为你在耶路撒冷之外
I think there's a bigger role for you

654
00:39:48,576 --> 00:39:51,712
能有更大作为 扫罗
beyond Jerusalem, Saul.

655
00:39:51,746 --> 00:39:53,447
有人要你的命
Men want you dead.

656
00:39:53,481 --> 00:39:56,683
哦 我不怕死 雅各
Oh, I'm not afraid of death, James.

657
00:39:56,718 --> 00:39:59,686
我努力想把你们向前拉
I'm trying to drag you all forward,

658
00:39:59,721 --> 00:40:02,689
但没有人... 没有人愿意听
and no one... no one will listen.

659
00:40:02,724 --> 00:40:05,592
那样不安全
It's not safe.

660
00:40:05,627 --> 00:40:08,728
而你留下 我们会为你担惊受怕
And we're scared for you if you stay here.

661
00:40:12,467 --> 00:40:15,002
仅此而已
That is all.

662
00:40:18,173 --> 00:40:19,706
我懂了
I see.

663
00:40:19,741 --> 00:40:24,411
所以.. 我们还是兄弟了?
So... we are all still brothers, then?

664
00:40:24,446 --> 00:40:27,080
- 当然  - 啊
- Of course.  - Ah.

665
00:40:27,115 --> 00:40:28,715
我们还会再见?
And we will meet again?

666
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,284
我保证
I promise.

667
00:40:31,286 --> 00:40:32,653
那好吧
Well, then.

668
00:40:33,955 --> 00:40:37,524
我不该再拿你们的生命冒险了
I shall risk your lives no longer.

669
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:40,327
我现在就走 一路上宣扬他的言语
I will leave now, teach his message as I go.

670
00:40:40,361 --> 00:40:42,563
是的 到大数之时
Yes, by the time I get to Tarsus,

671
00:40:42,597 --> 00:40:44,731
我会有一百位追随者
I will have a hundred followers.

672
00:40:54,843 --> 00:40:57,311
你会比我们所有人成就的更大
You will do more than any of us.

673
00:41:01,116 --> 00:41:03,316
神与你们所有人同在
God be with you all.

674
00:41:07,956 --> 00:41:13,894
如果耶路撒冷待不下去了 欢迎来找我
If Jerusalem gets too much, you're always welcome.

675
00:41:13,928 --> 00:41:17,097
包括你 西门
Even you, Simon.

676
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,997
一切在此结束
This ends here.

677
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,897
{\an8}最终两集

678
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,897
拯救这座城市免于罗马屠杀
Save the city from Roman massacre.

679
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,097
是否同仇敌忾?
Are you with us?

680
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,997
{\an8}叛乱者奋起

681
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,997
{\an8}预言将完成

682
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:45,997
你敢相信吗?
Do you dare to believe?

683
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,597
我相信
I believe.
