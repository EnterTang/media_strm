1
00:00:00,542 --> 00:00:04,143
拿撒勒人散播谣言说
The Nazarene spread rumor that he would rise

2
00:00:04,145 --> 00:00:06,412
他会在死去三天后复生
from his own death after three days.

3
00:00:06,414 --> 00:00:09,047
让神殿的护卫把守在外面
Post temple guards outside.

4
00:00:09,049 --> 00:00:11,518
而我会派遣罗马士兵
And I will post Roman soldiers.

5
00:00:17,957 --> 00:00:19,458
- 我看到他了  - 谁?
- I saw him.  - Who?

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,926
耶稣
Jesus.

7
00:00:20,928 --> 00:00:22,795
你相信他已经死而复生了吗?
Do you believe he has risen from the dead?

8
00:00:22,797 --> 00:00:24,697
他曾保证这些都会发生
It's what he promised would happen.

9
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:27,466
是时候由我们来结束这个故事了
It's time we shut this story down.

10
00:00:27,468 --> 00:00:29,435
杀掉所有坟墓守卫
Kill all the tomb guards.

11
00:00:31,138 --> 00:00:33,838
罗马皇帝的封印已经被破坏了
The Emperor's seal is broken.

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,206
我们究竟是走还是留?
Do we stay or go?

13
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:37,442
我让我的朋友们去城门口集合
I told my friends to make their way to the city gate

14
00:00:37,444 --> 00:00:40,644
- 然后想办法找到一条路  - 我们可以帮忙

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,681
- 现在就走  - 你为什么帮助我们?
- Go now.  - Why are you helping us?

16
00:00:43,683 --> 00:00:44,949
罗马人的敌人就是我们的朋友
An enemy of theirs is a friend of ours.

17
00:00:44,951 --> 00:00:46,917
是看守拿撒勒人坟墓的祭司们
The priests guarding the Nazarene's tomb.

18
00:00:46,919 --> 00:00:48,586
他们怎么了?

其中两位发现被人谋杀 而其余的都失踪了

32
00:01:26,623 --> 00:01:31,426
我怎么能和我的孩子说爱她 然后就离开?

34
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:39,501
耶路撒冷是个危险之地
Jerusalem is a dangerous place.

35
00:01:39,503 --> 00:01:41,702
彼得...
Peter...

36
00:01:41,704 --> 00:01:43,570
我们得回城去了
We have to go back to the city

37
00:01:43,572 --> 00:01:45,873
然后等待圣灵降临
and wait for the holy spirit.

38
00:01:51,813 --> 00:01:54,782
她开始长得像她的母亲了
She's starting to look like her mother.

39
00:01:54,784 --> 00:01:56,216
愿神安息她的灵魂

00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:00,820
父啊 照顾好我的孩子
Father, take care of my child.

00:02:00,822 --> 00:02:02,054
阿门
Amen.

42

我们去看看耶路撒冷究竟有什么等着我们

43
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:11,397
走吧 约翰
Come, John.

{\an8}耶路撒冷

46
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:29,681
我的丈夫被谋杀了!
My husband has been murdered!

47
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:35,886
我和三个孩子被孤苦伶仃地留在这世上
And I'm left alone in the world with three children.

48
00:02:35,888 --> 00:02:38,556
你丈夫是深受信赖的神殿守卫 
You have the sympathy of all at the temple

49
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:45,162
神殿所有同仁爱他 也向你表示深切哀悼
who worked with and loved a most trusted temple guard.

50
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:48,432
他的同仁多数也被谋杀了
Most of those whom he worked with have been killed, too.

51
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:52,769
你让他们看守那个拿撒勒人的墓地 对吗?
You had them guard the Nazarene's tomb?

52
00:02:52,771 --> 00:02:54,771
我们将不遗余力
We'll leave no stone unturned

53
00:02:54,773 --> 00:02:58,240
去搜寻谋杀犯... 相信我
in pursuit of their murderers... trust me.

54
00:03:00,845 --> 00:03:04,213
我们会送一些神殿里的救济食物和礼品
Charitable food and gifts from the temple

55
00:03:04,215 --> 00:03:06,449
到你家中
will be delivered to your home.

56

你听到了?
You heard?

57
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,734
她起疑心了

她在寻找理由 仅此而已
She's looking for reasons. That's all.

60
00:03:32,742 --> 00:03:39,078
六个人... 六个祭司被我们的罗马大人残杀!
Six men... six priests murdered by our Roman master!

61
00:03:40,383 --> 00:03:42,382
你知道为什么彼拉多要这么做
You know why Pilate did this.

62
00:03:42,384 --> 00:03:49,055
他必须清除当晚所有证人...
He had to remove all witnesses to that night...

63
00:03:49,057 --> 00:03:52,959
才能让那个荒唐的复活故事
to ensure that the ridiculous story of the resurrection

64
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:57,263
在愚民面前丝毫立不住脚跟
garners no credence amongst the gullible.

65
00:03:57,265 --> 00:04:00,065
它和那些士兵还有神殿守卫一起被埋葬了
It dies along with the soldiers and the temple guards,

66
00:04:00,067 --> 00:04:03,168
本该如此
as it should.

67
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:06,605
他们的死亡是必要的牺牲
Their deaths are a necessary sacrifice.

68
00:04:09,175 --> 00:04:11,677
但是那些家属...
But the families...

69
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:20,117
我们会留意确保他们得到照顾
We'll see to it that they're looked after.

70
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:42,105
快喝完 我们要打烊了
Drink up. We must close now.

71
00:04:42,107 --> 00:04:43,974
过来 过来
Come, come.

72
00:04:43,976 --> 00:04:45,809
我们得去把房间收拾出来
We need to get the rooms ready.

73
00:04:45,811 --> 00:04:47,277
街上人都满了
The streets are filling.

74
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:49,144
不像我的杯子 依旧空空如也
Unlike my cup, which remains resolutely empty.

75
00:04:50,514 --> 00:04:52,682
马库斯·德鲁苏斯 你每个斋戒日都这样
Marcus Drusus, you do this every feast day.

76
00:04:52,684 --> 00:04:54,550
你是个好人 埃里克
You're a good man, Arik...

77
00:04:54,552 --> 00:04:56,819
你是个糟糕的掌柜 但是个好人
A lousy landlord, but a good man.

78
00:04:57,989 --> 00:05:01,023
站起来 快点 快点
On your feet. Come on, come on.

79
00:05:01,025 --> 00:05:02,091
快点!
Come on!

80
00:05:05,628 --> 00:05:07,696
原谅我 朋友 不小心
Forgive me, friend. Clumsy.

81
00:05:17,006 --> 00:05:19,540
不要伤人
No harm done.

82
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:21,242
刚刚是个意外
It was an accident.

83
00:05:21,244 --> 00:05:23,077
波阿斯?
Boaz?

84
00:05:27,682 --> 00:05:29,182
- 跟我走  - 不要伤人
- Follow me.  - No harm done.

85
00:05:31,552 --> 00:05:33,186
波阿斯!
Boaz!

86
00:05:36,357 --> 00:05:37,958
还不到时候!
Not yet!

87
00:05:42,096 --> 00:05:45,231
那个拿撒勒人的随从可能会利用这个时机
The Nazarene's men might use this moment

88
00:05:45,233 --> 00:05:46,866
挑起更多骚动
to stir up more trouble.

89
00:05:51,538 --> 00:05:53,106
继续在街上巡逻
Keep patrolling the streets,

90
00:05:53,108 --> 00:05:55,074
至少巡逻到斋戒日结束
at least until the festival is over.

91
00:05:55,076 --> 00:05:57,676
这里发生了什么事?
What happened in here?

92
00:05:57,678 --> 00:06:00,112
政治问题 没什么的
Politics. Nothing more.

93
00:06:00,114 --> 00:06:02,514
我和你在一起已久
I've been with you long enough

94
00:06:02,516 --> 00:06:04,182
你有什么困扰我能看出来
to know when something's troubling you.

95
00:06:04,184 --> 00:06:05,684
我没有困扰
I'm not troubled.

96
00:06:05,686 --> 00:06:07,853
别把我和别人的妻子混为一谈
Don't confuse me with other people's wives.

97
00:06:07,855 --> 00:06:09,821
我怎么会呢?
How could I?

98
00:06:09,823 --> 00:06:11,990
你若以诚待我 我便会伴你左右
If you deal honestly with me, I'll stand beside you.

99
00:06:11,992 --> 00:06:14,758
- 克劳迪娅...  - 究竟发生了什么事?
- Claudia...  - What happened?

100
00:06:15,961 --> 00:06:21,799
确实有件小事让我困扰了一段时日
I was troubled for a time by a minor irritation.

101
00:06:21,801 --> 00:06:22,996
结果你就
Which you dealt with

102
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:26,671
杀掉那些看守拿撒勒人坟墓的人?
by having the Nazarene's tomb guards killed?

103
00:06:26,673 --> 00:06:29,406
就在这 在我屋子里?
Here, in my house?

104
00:06:30,908 --> 00:06:33,509
我们不应该对彼此有所隐瞒
We shouldn't keep secrets from each other.

105
00:06:33,511 --> 00:06:38,247
确实不该
No, we shouldn't.

106
00:06:41,285 --> 00:06:44,187
今天又是新的一天
Today is a new day,

107
00:06:44,189 --> 00:06:46,589
希律同他的妻子要来拜访
with a visit from Herod and his wife.

108
00:06:46,591 --> 00:06:49,792
让我们一起迎接他们
Let's welcome them together.

109
00:07:04,407 --> 00:07:09,276
让开! 给希律·安提帕王让路!
Make way! Make way for King Herod Antipas!

110
00:07:09,278 --> 00:07:10,778
希律王!
The King!

111
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:14,816
给希律王让路!
Make way for King Herod Antipas!

112
00:07:20,989 --> 00:07:24,958
希罗底 是我一个人这么觉得
Herodias, is it me,

113
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,796
还是拿撒勒人耶稣被钉死之后
but since the crucifixion of the Nazarene,

114
00:07:29,798 --> 00:07:32,232
街上的罗马士兵确实比平常多了?
are there more Roman soldiers in the streets than usual?

115
00:07:32,234 --> 00:07:34,801
街上的士兵确实更多了 没错
There's definitely more soldiers, yes.

116
00:07:34,803 --> 00:07:36,302
守卫!
Guard!

117
00:07:36,304 --> 00:07:38,004
这是什么意思?!
What is the meaning of this?!

118
00:07:39,941 --> 00:07:43,976
跟百夫长说我们一直都是从这条街过的
Tell the centurion we always process through the streets!

119
00:07:43,978 --> 00:07:45,577
人民期望如此!
The people expect it!

120
00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:49,849
我是希律王 他们必须让我通行
I am the King. They must let us through.

121
00:07:52,854 --> 00:07:55,020
百夫长 这是怎么了?
Centurion, what is this?

122
00:07:55,022 --> 00:07:57,321
禁止通行 这是上头的命令
No one passes. Those are our orders.

123
00:07:57,323 --> 00:07:59,323
必须让希律王通行
The King must be allowed through.

124
00:07:59,325 --> 00:08:00,558
他们让我们过去吗?
Are they letting us through?

125
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,893
- 让希律王过去!  - 管他是谁!
- Let the King pass!  - I don't care!

126
00:08:01,895 --> 00:08:03,527
谁也不行!
No one!

127
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:04,996
不让
No.

128
00:08:09,133 --> 00:08:10,601
该亚法 告诉我
Caiaphas, tell me,

129
00:08:10,603 --> 00:08:13,470
为什么这座城好像要爆发了似的?
why does the city feel like it's about to erupt?

130
00:08:13,472 --> 00:08:15,372
人民神经紧张 仅此而已
Nerves are jangling. Nothing more.

131
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,609
这和拿撒勒人
It couldn't have anything to do

132
00:08:19,611 --> 00:08:22,112
被处决没有关系 对吧?
with the execution of the Nazarene, could it?

133
00:08:22,114 --> 00:08:26,616
他死了 他的门徒被驱散了
He's gone, and his followers are dispersed.

134
00:08:26,618 --> 00:08:29,386
那为什么街上挤满了罗马士兵?
Then why are the streets crammed with Roman soldiers?

135
00:08:29,388 --> 00:08:31,988
巡抚... 情绪不定
The Governor's... unsettled.

136
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,823
哦 巡抚情绪不定 是吗?
Oh, the Governor's unsettled, is he?

137
00:08:33,825 --> 00:08:37,693
难道不是因为你对整件事处理不当?!
It couldn't be that you mishandled the whole thing?!

138
00:08:37,695 --> 00:08:43,399
你在夜里秘密审判了那个人
You tried the man at night, in secret,

139
00:08:43,401 --> 00:08:44,667
违反了犹太律法
contrary to Jewish law,

140
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:46,402
然后你又让罗马人处决了他!
and then you had the Romans execute him!

141
00:08:46,404 --> 00:08:48,369
我只是做了该做之事
I did what was necessary.

142
00:08:48,371 --> 00:08:51,472
你这么做反倒让他变得重要起来了
You made him far more important than he need be.

143
00:08:51,474 --> 00:08:54,074
我们老这么利用罗马人
Our continued use of the Romans

144
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:55,676
会让街上的民众
could be seen as collaboration

145
00:08:55,678 --> 00:08:57,012
认为我们和罗马人勾结
by the average man in the street.

146
00:08:57,014 --> 00:08:58,746
你现在倒理解街上的普通民众了 是吗?
You understand the average man in the street now, do you?

147
00:08:58,748 --> 00:09:01,716
人并不需要变得普通
One doesn't need to be average

148
00:09:01,718 --> 00:09:04,718
才能理解普通人 该亚法
to understand the average man, Caiaphas.

149
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,253
成千上万的朝圣者
With thousands of pilgrims

150
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:08,355
会在五旬节涌入街头
flocking into the street for Pentecost,

151
00:09:08,357 --> 00:09:11,725
我们一定不能被视作与罗马关系太过紧密
we must not be seen to be too closely aligned with Rome.

152
00:09:11,727 --> 00:09:14,329
要确保不会 该亚法
Ensure we are not, Caiaphas.

153
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:24,841
我们还能待在比这更差的地方吗
We couldn't have chosen a worse place to be.

154
00:09:24,843 --> 00:09:27,476
- 这里很危险  - 简直是自杀
- It's dangerous.  - It's suicidal.

155
00:09:31,715 --> 00:09:33,049
彼得
Peter.

156
00:09:33,051 --> 00:09:34,850
马太! 哦!
Matthew! Oh!

157
00:09:34,852 --> 00:09:37,118
- 大家都在吗?  - 基本都在
- Are we all here?  - Nearly.

158
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,720
我希望你是带着计划来的
I hope you come with a plan.

159
00:09:38,722 --> 00:09:40,288
只有他给我们的那个...
Only the one he gave us...

160
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,325
回到耶路撒冷 然后等待圣灵的降临
To return to Jerusalem and wait for the holy spirit.

161
00:09:43,327 --> 00:09:44,993
等多久?
For how long?

162
00:09:44,995 --> 00:09:46,895
我和你知道的一样多 西门
I know as much as you, Simon.

163
00:09:46,897 --> 00:09:50,698
他说要建造起他的教堂 怎么造? 用什么?
He said he'd build his church. How? With what?

164
00:09:50,999 --> 00:09:52,533
我不知道
I don't know.

165
00:09:52,535 --> 00:09:55,134
他会用这间房里缺少的
He'll build it with two things

166
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,803
两样东西来建造
that are lacking in this room...

167
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:58,705
信念...
belief...

168
00:09:58,707 --> 00:10:02,076
和忍耐
and patience.

169
00:10:05,281 --> 00:10:06,948
看我找到了谁
Look who I found.

170
00:10:09,983 --> 00:10:10,684
玛雅
Maya.

171
00:10:18,225 --> 00:10:21,827
那么我们就对所需何事达成一致了?
Then we are agreed on what is necessary?

172
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:25,030
是的 需要一个平安无事的五旬节
Yes. An uneventful Pentecost.

173
00:10:25,032 --> 00:10:26,665
所以我们互相理解了
So we understand one another.

174
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:31,903
我的地位是不会动摇的
My position is unassailable.

175
00:10:31,905 --> 00:10:33,738
然而 你的地位
Yours, however,

176
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,340
则仰赖于犹太公会的忠诚
is reliant on the loyalty of the Sanhedrin

177
00:10:36,342 --> 00:10:37,810
和另一件事...
and one other thing...

178
00:10:39,112 --> 00:10:42,013
我的认可
my endorsement.

179
00:10:42,515 --> 00:10:44,549
再有处理不当
Any more mishandling

180
00:10:44,551 --> 00:10:48,519
我们就必须认真重新考虑你的职位了
and we shall have to seriously reconsider your role.

181
00:10:48,521 --> 00:10:49,986
给可怜的瘸子赏点东西吧?
Anything for a poor cripple?

182
00:10:49,988 --> 00:10:53,858
给可怜的瘸子赏几个硬币吧?
A few coins for a poor cripple?

183
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:57,961
给可怜的倒霉蛋赏点东西吧?
Anything for a poor misfortunate?

184
00:10:57,963 --> 00:10:59,930
给他一点钱 该亚法
Give him some money, Caiaphas.

185
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:10,840
愿神保佑你!
God bless you!

186
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,882
你买一个吗? 你从我这买一个吧?
You buy one? You buy one from me?

187
00:11:19,884 --> 00:11:21,684
一边待着
Wait.

188
00:11:37,633 --> 00:11:40,267
我是来帮你的
I am here to help.

189
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:41,502
愿神保佑你
God bless you.

190
00:11:41,504 --> 00:11:44,972
在神殿这件事上
My husband's hands are tied,

191
00:11:44,974 --> 00:11:47,075
我的丈夫有所掣肘
as far as the temple is concerned.

192
00:11:47,077 --> 00:11:50,778
然而 与他们的建议相反
However, contrary to their suggestion,

193
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,780
我们愿意达成一项私人约定
we would like to come to a private arrangement

194
00:11:53,782 --> 00:11:56,415
每年给你们一笔抚恤金
and give you an annual income,

195
00:11:56,417 --> 00:11:58,585
至少到你的孩子长大成人
at least until your children are old enough

196
00:11:58,587 --> 00:11:59,852
可以养活自己为止
to earn for themselves.

197
00:11:59,854 --> 00:12:01,455
为什么神殿不想救助我们?
Why would the temple not want to help?

198
00:12:01,457 --> 00:12:03,924
我的丈夫是一个深受尊敬的祭司
My husband was a well-respected priest.

199
00:12:03,926 --> 00:12:08,360
信得过他 才派他去看守那个拿撒勒人的坟墓
He was trusted to guard the Nazarene's tomb.

200
00:12:08,362 --> 00:12:09,862
确实如此...
He was...

201
00:12:09,864 --> 00:12:11,163
那究竟有什么事?
What is it?

202
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:14,533
没什么
Nothing.

203
00:12:14,535 --> 00:12:16,769
- 你究竟有什么事不告诉我?  - 我该走了
- What aren't you telling me?  - I should go.

204
00:12:16,771 --> 00:12:20,006
为什么神殿不批准赡养他的家人?
Why would the temple not endorse support for his family?

205
00:12:20,008 --> 00:12:22,274
他是不是做错了什么事?
Had he done something wrong?

206
00:12:22,276 --> 00:12:25,310
求你了 告诉我
Please, tell me.

207
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:28,246
我要知道他为什么被人杀害
I need to know why he was murdered.

208
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:35,220
你必须马上离开耶路撒冷...
You must leave Jerusalem immediately...

209
00:12:36,824 --> 00:12:40,158
而且永远不再回来 免得遭受同样的命运
and never return without suffering the same fate.

210
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:47,031
我们会每年给你抚恤金
As well as the annual income,

211
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:51,035
还会给你找一个新家
we will find you a new home.

212
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:53,570
在离这够远的地方
Somewhere far away enough

213
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:58,174
这样你 尤其是你的孩子
so that you and, more importantly, your children

214
00:12:58,176 --> 00:13:00,243
才能够重新开始
can start again.

215
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:50,557
我上回来这里的时候 有个来自安纳托利亚的乐师
When I was here last, you had musicians from Anatolia.

216
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:51,924
从基利家来的 是的
From Cilicia, yes.

217
00:13:51,926 --> 00:13:55,328
基利家 没错
Cilicia, yes.

218
00:13:57,431 --> 00:14:00,299
这就是生活在罗马管辖下的
Yet another example of the advantages

219
00:14:00,301 --> 00:14:02,034
好处之一
of living under Rome's influence.

220
00:14:02,036 --> 00:14:05,572
还有得到改善的港口 贸易路线
Along with the improved ports, trading routes,

221
00:14:05,574 --> 00:14:08,774
船运 法律 音乐 诗歌
shipping, laws, music, poetry.

222
00:14:08,776 --> 00:14:10,776
我们更愿意称其为你来我往的
We like to think that our cultural interaction

223
00:14:10,778 --> 00:14:12,011
文化交流
goes both ways.

224
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,985
我们目前在庆祝的
This festival of Pentecost,

225
00:14:19,987 --> 00:14:21,587
这个五旬节
which we are currently celebrating,

226
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:24,622
是为了纪念我们与摩西律法自古以来的联系
commemorates our link back to the laws of Moses,

227
00:14:24,624 --> 00:14:27,225
然而也加强了我们在当今世界里的作用
and yet enhances our role in the modern world.

228
00:14:27,227 --> 00:14:29,927
归功于罗马帝国的宽容 你们才得以自由发挥
A role that, thanks to Roman tolerance,

229
00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:31,962
你们的作用
you're free to express.

230
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:34,765
一定程度上是这样
To a degree.

231
00:14:38,636 --> 00:14:41,070
我是神殿的管理者兼守护者
I am warden and guardian of the temple,

232
00:14:41,072 --> 00:14:44,108
因此 我想我要提出一个小要求
and as such, I feel I have a small request to make.

233
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,642
你说
Go on.

234
00:14:45,644 --> 00:14:49,579
在这个时期 让罗马士兵围住神殿
Roman soldiers around the temple this time of year

235
00:14:49,581 --> 00:14:55,152
可无益于让人民感受到您的宽容
do not help to make the people feel your tolerance.

236
00:14:55,154 --> 00:14:57,319
实际上恰恰相反
Quite the opposite, in fact.

237
00:14:57,321 --> 00:15:02,357
我们都心知肚明我们的国土被罗马占领了
We are all too aware that we are an occupied country.

238
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,425
那你有何建议?
And what do you suggest?

239
00:15:04,427 --> 00:15:08,831
我建议您从我的神殿撤军
I would suggest that you remove your troops from my temple

240
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:12,534
让我的人民能和平欢度他们的节日
and let my people celebrate their festival in peace.

241
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:17,872
你的人民 你的神殿?
Your people and your temple?

242
00:15:17,874 --> 00:15:20,876
我知道您无意让局面动荡不安
I understand your intentions are not to incite unrest.

243
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:26,681
不 不 不
No, no, no.

244
00:15:26,683 --> 00:15:29,617
这可不是你的城市
It's not your city.

245
00:15:31,187 --> 00:15:34,155
我来告诉你我会做什么吧
I'll tell you what I'll do.

246
00:15:34,157 --> 00:15:38,458
我会在神殿周围部署双倍巡逻
I'll double my patrols around the temple,

247
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:45,966
我还会亲自去参加这个节日
and I'll attend the festival myself, in person.

248
00:15:47,502 --> 00:15:50,736
宴会结束了 哥尼流
The party's over. Cornelius.

249
00:15:54,308 --> 00:15:56,876
我敦请您劝劝他
I urge you to counsel him.

250
00:15:56,878 --> 00:15:59,179
从来没有巡抚参加过这个节日庆典
No governor has ever attended a festival.

251
00:15:59,181 --> 00:16:02,081
太有挑衅意味了
It will be highly provocative.

252
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:05,804
无论我的丈夫做任何事 我都支持他
I support my husband in all he does.

253
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,337
你一个人来这的?
You traveled here alone?

254
00:16:28,296 --> 00:16:31,565
在河边看见你后没多久 我就出发了
I set off soon after I saw you by the river.

255
00:16:33,467 --> 00:16:35,401
我知道我们必须再次离开
I knew we had to leave again.

256
00:16:35,403 --> 00:16:37,737
我不想伤害你
I didn't want to hurt you.

257
00:16:37,739 --> 00:16:39,071
但你还是伤害了
And then you did.

258
00:16:46,947 --> 00:16:49,414
我跟祖母说了要带你回家
I told grandmother I'd bring you home.

259
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,484
她想你
She misses you.

260
00:16:52,486 --> 00:16:53,819
我还不能回家
I can't come home yet.

261
00:16:53,821 --> 00:16:55,654
那我就等到你能为止
Then I'll wait until you can.

262
00:16:55,656 --> 00:16:57,989
- 你不能留在这 玛雅  - 为什么不行?
- You can't stay here, Maya.  - Why not?

263
00:16:57,991 --> 00:17:00,525
要不了多久 我们又要搬走了 
We're moving again, ourselves, soon.

264
00:17:02,094 --> 00:17:03,362
我不介意
I don't mind.

265
00:17:15,006 --> 00:17:20,210
我们在这做的事情... 会很危险
What we're doing here... It could be dangerous.

266
00:17:21,946 --> 00:17:24,481
追随拉比有什么危险的?
What's so dangerous about following a rabbi?

267
00:17:41,264 --> 00:17:43,465
你还戴着它啊
You're still wearing it.

268
00:17:47,371 --> 00:17:49,971
真坚强
Iron.

269
00:17:52,642 --> 00:17:55,143
跟我讲讲家乡的事儿
Tell me a story from home.

270
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,483
艾弗纳的儿子 约书亚
Avner's son, Joshua,

271
00:18:02,485 --> 00:18:05,019
他觉得他已经是个特别厉害的捕鱼人了
thinks he's a great fisherman now,

272
00:18:05,021 --> 00:18:08,222
但他其实才乘船出海了三次
but he's only been out in the boat three times.

273
00:18:10,894 --> 00:18:13,027
在神殿山上会部署300士兵
You'll have 300 men on the temple mount,

274
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:15,395
还有500守卫同您一起
and you'll be accompanied by 500 bodyguards.

275
00:18:15,397 --> 00:18:19,900
我们尽可能速进速出
We go in fast and get out as quickly as we can.

276
00:18:19,902 --> 00:18:22,068
不行
No.

277
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:25,972
要是我置身500人中间 民众还怎么能看见我?
If I'm in the middle of 500 men, how can I be seen?

278
00:18:25,974 --> 00:18:29,643
你和50名士兵同我一起 不能再多了
You and 50 men shall accompany me, no more.

279
00:18:29,645 --> 00:18:32,611
遵命
As you wish.

280
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:41,420
我希望这可不仅仅是个"让别人看见我"的问题
I hope this is more than just a case of "look at me."

281
00:18:41,422 --> 00:18:44,356
我早就该这么做了...
I should have done this ages ago...

282
00:18:44,358 --> 00:18:47,526
让他们看看谁才是真正掌权的人
Show them who's really in charge.

283
00:18:47,528 --> 00:18:50,027
你应该听百夫长的话
You should listen to your centurion.

284
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:55,266
我应该做的是带你去床上
What I should do is take you to bed.

285
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,442
明天之前你都该好好休息
You need to rest before tomorrow.

286
00:19:26,763 --> 00:19:28,464
我们不能出去吗?
Can't we go out?

287
00:19:28,466 --> 00:19:31,868
一旦街上的士兵少点了... 我们就出去
We'll leave... once there are less soldiers on the streets.

288
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,703
只要我们最近不到外面去
If we don't get back out there soon,

289
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:36,205
- 大家都会把我们给忘光了  - 不 他们不会的
- everyone will have forgotten who we are.  - No, they won't.

290
00:19:36,207 --> 00:19:37,974
你真以为我们吓到了那些当权者?
Do you really think we scared the authorities?

291
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,441
他们要是知道那件事会吓得更厉害
We'd scare them even more if they knew.

292
00:19:40,443 --> 00:19:41,977
知道什么事?
Knew what?

293
00:19:44,313 --> 00:19:46,047
知道我们已经看见了他
That we'd seen him.

294
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:47,883
多马
Thomas.

295
00:19:47,885 --> 00:19:49,117
看见了谁?
Seen who?

296
00:19:50,452 --> 00:19:51,753
耶稣
Jesus.

297
00:19:53,389 --> 00:19:57,457
我们每个人还同他说话了
We've spoken to him, all of us.

298
00:20:04,065 --> 00:20:06,199
你不会相信的 对吗?
You don't believe this, do you?

299
00:20:06,201 --> 00:20:09,937
开始的时候我吓坏了
I was scared at first.

300
00:20:09,939 --> 00:20:11,438
我想我们都吓坏了
I think we all were.

301
00:20:13,641 --> 00:20:17,043
但他有血有肉 像你一样真实
But he was as real as you are now.

302
00:20:19,513 --> 00:20:22,815
那你们为什么不出去告诉大家呢?
Then why aren't you out there telling people?

303
00:20:22,817 --> 00:20:25,317
为什么你们要把自己关在这里?
Why are you all shut away up here?

304
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:27,353
我们在等待
We're waiting.

305
00:20:27,355 --> 00:20:30,989
等待什么?!
For what?!

306
00:20:30,991 --> 00:20:32,758
圣灵降临
The holy spirit.

307
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,793
那又有什么用?
How will that help?

308
00:20:34,795 --> 00:20:37,930
当它降临... 我们自会知道
We'll... know when it gets here.

309
00:20:39,398 --> 00:20:41,332
那它什么时候降临?
And when does it get here?

310
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,204
这你也不知道?
You don't know that, either?

311
00:20:46,206 --> 00:20:47,539
你问得太多了!
So many questions!

312
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,206
是你教我要提问的 记得吗?
You taught me to ask questions, remember?

313
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,275
她可真是你女儿
She's definitely your daughter.

314
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,664
朋友...
Friend...

315
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,267
有什么消息吗?
you have information?

316
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:19,636
是的
Yes.

317
00:21:19,638 --> 00:21:21,837
哥尼流召回了所有的百夫长
Cornelius has recalled all centurions,

318
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:25,007
我还听说彼拉多会在五旬节造访神庙
and I hear Pilate will visit the temple on Pentecost.

319
00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:28,944
这是对我们圣地的亵渎
This desecration of our sacred space

320
00:21:28,946 --> 00:21:33,181
这就是先知们所说的可憎之事
is the abomination the prophets talked about.

321
00:21:33,183 --> 00:21:37,615
那我们下手的时间就到了
Then our time has come to kill him.

322
00:22:09,612 --> 00:22:12,327
每当这样的夜晚 我都希望我回到了凯撒利亚
It's nights like this I wish I was back in Caesarea.

323
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,745
我在这里无法入睡
I cannot sleep here.

324
00:22:15,181 --> 00:22:16,648
这里过去是我父亲的宫殿
This used to be my father's palace.

325
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,084
在我们之前是
Before us.

326
00:22:19,086 --> 00:22:21,086
在你们之前是
Before you.

327
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,590
我要回去睡了
I was going back to bed.

328
00:22:25,592 --> 00:22:28,493
祝你睡得安稳
I wish you a restful night.

329
00:22:28,495 --> 00:22:30,060
你也是
You too.

330
00:22:52,216 --> 00:22:54,984
你为什么还没睡?
What's keeping you awake?

331
00:22:54,986 --> 00:22:58,054
我猜 是跟你一样的原因
The same thing as you, I'd imagine.

332
00:22:58,056 --> 00:23:00,623
关于明天
Concern about tomorrow,

333
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:03,425
彼拉多的安全一事
for the safety of Pilate.

334
00:23:06,696 --> 00:23:09,064
向我保证你会保护好他
Promise me you'll take care of him.

335
00:23:10,366 --> 00:23:12,668
这是我职责所在
That's my job.

336
00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:18,272
那就好好干
Do it well.

337
00:23:26,715 --> 00:23:30,217
你们还记得在加利利的时候 这个人 他抓住了...
Do you remember in Galilee, this man here, he caught...

338
00:23:30,219 --> 00:23:32,053
没人见过 没有人见到过
No one ever saw it. No one ever saw it.

339
00:23:32,055 --> 00:23:33,820
那是我见过最大的鳟鱼...
This was the biggest trout...

340
00:23:33,822 --> 00:23:36,122
如果他们找到你...
If they find you...

341
00:23:38,392 --> 00:23:40,794
他们会杀掉你吗?
will they kill you?

342
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:49,235
不会
No.

343
00:23:49,237 --> 00:23:51,537
他们可杀了他
They killed him.

344
00:23:56,577 --> 00:23:58,044
所以呢?
So?

345
00:24:00,681 --> 00:24:02,949
他们会吗?
Will they?

346
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,153
我不知道
I don't know.

347
00:24:28,773 --> 00:24:32,042
彼拉多明天打算亲自造访神庙
Pilate intends to visit the temple himself tomorrow.

348
00:24:34,045 --> 00:24:36,680
那必须有人劝劝他
Well, he has to be dissuaded.

349
00:24:36,682 --> 00:24:39,016
- 他为什么要去?  - 为了证明一件事
- Why is he coming?  - To prove a point.

350
00:24:39,018 --> 00:24:40,150
向你?
To you?

351
00:24:40,152 --> 00:24:41,851
向我们所有人
To all of us.

352
00:24:51,629 --> 00:24:54,396
民众会受不了的
Well, the people won't stand for it.

353
00:24:54,398 --> 00:24:56,398
我们比罗马人多
We outnumber the Romans.

354
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,067
我们可以关上神殿的门
We could always bar the doors.

355
00:24:58,069 --> 00:25:02,403
这可是五旬节 我们的人也会被关在外面
At Pentecost, to our people, as well?

356
00:25:02,405 --> 00:25:04,372
会引起骚乱的
It would be mayhem.

357
00:25:04,374 --> 00:25:07,776
该亚法 你一定要有所行动
You must do something, Caiaphas.

358
00:25:09,746 --> 00:25:14,883
也许 我们可以把他当作荣誉嘉宾
Perhaps we should receive him as our honored guest.

359
00:25:14,885 --> 00:25:18,352
决不能让彼拉多把我们的节日变成血腥屠杀
Pilate cannot be allowed to turn our festival into a bloodbath.

360
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,751
你该睡觉了
You should be sleeping.

361
00:25:52,753 --> 00:25:54,153
你也是
So should you.

362
00:25:57,924 --> 00:26:00,125
你害怕吗?
Are you afraid?

363
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:03,328
是的
I am.

364
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:08,599
不是害怕罗马人或是祭司
Not of the Romans or the priests.

365
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:13,805
我怕自己并不是耶稣
I'm afraid I may not be the person

366
00:26:13,807 --> 00:26:15,606
所想象的那个人
that Jesus thinks I am.

367
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:22,980
你在家的时候我总是有安全感
I always felt safe when you were home,

368
00:26:22,982 --> 00:26:26,482
你很明确地知道自己想要什么东西
like you knew exactly what you wanted

369
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:29,385
以及怎样才能得到那件东西
and how you were going to get it.

370
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:33,423
那个时候 我只想多捕些鱼
Back then, all I wanted was fish.

371
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,559
有鱼就有钱赚
Fish meant money,

372
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:39,629
有钱就能买到食物和衣服
and money meant food and clothes.

373
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:41,731
那时的生活很简单
Life was simple.

374
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:44,100
现在不简单了吗?
And now it isn't?

375
00:26:47,003 --> 00:26:50,272
如果他在这的话会怎么做?
What would he do if he were here?

376
00:26:50,274 --> 00:26:51,506
他会祈祷
He'd pray.

377
00:27:04,854 --> 00:27:06,855
约翰 起来了!
John, wake up!

378
00:27:06,857 --> 00:27:08,223
大家...
All of you...

379
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,325
起来啊! 来啊!
Wake! Come!

380
00:27:11,327 --> 00:27:13,261
我们要做什么?
What are we doing?

381
00:27:13,263 --> 00:27:15,657
我们要祈祷
We're praying.

382
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,176
五旬节

383
00:27:58,275 --> 00:28:00,776
我们在天上的父 愿人都尊你的名为圣
Our father in heaven, hallowed be your name.

384
00:28:00,778 --> 00:28:03,646
愿你的国降临 愿你的旨意
Your kingdom come, your will be done,

385
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:06,316
行在地上 如同行在天上
on earth as it is in heaven.

386
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:09,552
我们日用的饮食 今日赐给我们 免我们的债
Give us today our daily bread, and forgive us our debts,

387
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:11,988
如同我们免了人的债
as we have also forgiven our debtors.

388
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:14,189
不叫我们遇见试探
And lead us not into temptation,

389
00:28:14,191 --> 00:28:16,658
救我们脱离那恶者
but deliver us from the evil one.

390
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:20,628
我们在天上的父 愿人都尊你的名为圣
Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be your name.

391
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:23,866
愿你的国降临 愿你的旨意行在地上...
Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth...

392
00:28:29,672 --> 00:28:33,307
我们日用的饮食 今日赐给我们 免我们的债
Give us today our daily bread, and forgive us our debts,

393
00:28:33,309 --> 00:28:36,043
如同我们免了人的债
as we have also forgiven our debtors.

394
00:28:36,045 --> 00:28:37,811
不叫我们遇见试探
And lead us not into temptation,

395
00:28:37,813 --> 00:28:39,847
救我们脱离那恶者
but deliver us from the evil one.

396
00:28:42,817 --> 00:28:45,920
我们在天上的父 愿人都尊你的名为圣
Our father in heaven, hallowed be your name.

397
00:28:45,922 --> 00:28:48,521
愿你的国降临 愿你的旨意
Your kingdom come, your will be done,

398
00:28:48,523 --> 00:28:51,358
行在地上如同行在天上
on earth as it is in heaven.

399
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,028
我们日用的饮食 今日赐给我们 免我们的债...
Give us today our daily bread, and forgive us our debts...

400
00:29:38,469 --> 00:29:44,408
现在我们要离开此地
Now we can leave this place.

401
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:48,111
现在我们为他传道
Now we spread his word.

402
00:29:58,822 --> 00:30:01,090
不论如何 我们都要保护巡抚!
At all times, we shield the governor!

403
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:03,492
谁若敢上前一步...
The first person to step forward...

404
00:30:03,494 --> 00:30:04,827
我就取他的首级
I'll have his head.

405
00:30:22,011 --> 00:30:25,680
巡抚 大祭司要您跟着我
Governor, the high priest would ask that you follow me

406
00:30:25,682 --> 00:30:27,415
从神殿的南门进去
and enter the temple through one of the south gates.

407
00:30:27,417 --> 00:30:29,783
为什么?
Why?

408
00:30:29,785 --> 00:30:31,151
那扇美门通往妇人院
The Beautiful Gate leads to the Court of the Women,

409
00:30:31,153 --> 00:30:32,953
只有犹太人才能进入
which is for Jews only.

410
00:30:32,955 --> 00:30:37,291
他还礼貌地要求您把武器留在外面
He also requests politely that you leave your weapons outside.

411
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,793
那我礼貌地拒绝这两条要求
I decline both requests politely.

412
00:30:39,795 --> 00:30:41,695
我们就从这里进去
We enter here.

413
00:30:41,697 --> 00:30:42,963
列队!
Cohort!

414
00:31:51,694 --> 00:31:52,695
我们去哪?
Where are we going?

415
00:31:52,697 --> 00:31:54,563
神殿啊 还能去哪?
The temple. Where else?

416
00:31:59,303 --> 00:32:02,737
我希望你清楚自己在做什么 该亚法
I do hope you know what you're doing, Caiaphas.

417
00:32:02,739 --> 00:32:04,706
你真的以为这样能行?
And you really believe this will work?

418
00:32:04,708 --> 00:32:07,776
如果不成功 他们会同罗马人一起撕了我们
If it doesn't, they'll tear us apart along with the Romans.

419
00:32:20,189 --> 00:32:22,790
请肃静!
Quiet, please!

420
00:32:22,792 --> 00:32:25,560
肃静
Quiet.

421
00:32:26,692 --> 00:32:29,460
请大家肃静

422
00:32:30,992 --> 00:32:35,160
我知道以前从未有巡抚光临

423
00:32:36,092 --> 00:32:38,560
但你们要明白

424
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,641
他来此是为赎自己的罪

425
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,641
他在说什么?
What's he saying?

426
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:47,741
他带了礼物向我们的信仰致敬

427
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:52,741
并要在神前屈身敬拜

428
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,141
所以与其谴责

429
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:59,341
我们应当宽容他

430
00:33:39,029 --> 00:33:41,464
右边有情况!
Trouble to the right!

431
00:33:42,832 --> 00:33:43,832
上!
Go!

432
00:33:47,638 --> 00:33:49,405
别挡着路!
Get out of the way!

433
00:33:58,814 --> 00:34:00,014
闪开!
Move!

434
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,020
哥尼流!
Cornelius!

435
00:34:09,192 --> 00:34:09,991
让路!
Make way!

436
00:34:09,993 --> 00:34:11,192
别挡着路!
Get out of my way!

437
00:34:22,237 --> 00:34:23,671
起来
Up.

438
00:34:29,176 --> 00:34:31,043
但愿你死得其所
I hope your cause is worth dying for.

439
00:34:31,045 --> 00:34:32,437
愿你如此
I hope yours is.

440
00:34:50,437 --> 00:34:52,052
给点钱吧 大人?
A few coins, master?

441
00:35:00,628 --> 00:35:02,295
你看我们
Look at us.

442
00:35:02,297 --> 00:35:04,330
我们没钱
We have no money.

443
00:35:06,099 --> 00:35:08,234
金银我都没有
No silver, no gold.

444
00:35:16,175 --> 00:35:23,782
只把我所有的给你 我奉拿撒勒人耶稣的名给你
But what I have I give you in the name of Jesus of Nazareth.

445
00:35:25,052 --> 00:35:28,486
叫你起来行走
Rise up and walk.

446
00:35:53,978 --> 00:35:59,549
藉着耶稣 这人能重新行走了
It's through Jesus that this man walks again.

447
00:35:59,551 --> 00:36:05,220
神给我们差来他的仆人 耶稣
God sent us his servant, Jesus,

448
00:36:05,222 --> 00:36:11,760
神又叫他从死里复活了
and God raised him again from death.

449
00:36:11,762 --> 00:36:14,497
我们是他的见证
We are his witnesses,

450
00:36:14,499 --> 00:36:18,266
圣灵与我们同在 让我们坚强
and the holy spirit is with us and makes us strong.

451
00:36:18,268 --> 00:36:21,402
耶稣还活着
Jesus is alive.

452
00:36:24,073 --> 00:36:26,774
让以色列众人知道...
Let all Israel know...

453
00:36:26,776 --> 00:36:31,779
神立耶稣为主 为弥赛亚了
God made Jesus Lord and Messiah.

454
00:36:32,781 --> 00:36:35,416
我以为你已经摆平这些信众了 该亚法
I thought you had dealt with these followers, Caiaphas.

455
00:36:35,418 --> 00:36:37,384
加入我们
Join us,

456
00:36:37,386 --> 00:36:41,054
你们也必领受圣灵
and you, too, will receive the holy spirit.

457
00:36:41,056 --> 00:36:44,758
让他们闭嘴 以免再起骚乱
Silence them now, before he starts another riot.

458
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,793
来吧 拯救你们自己脱离这残酷的...
Come, save yourselves from this cruel wo...

459
00:36:47,963 --> 00:36:49,763
彼得!
Peter!

460

00:36:53,801 --> 00:36:56,736
在地上显出神迹!

463
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:03,475
日头要变为黑暗 月亮要变为血!
The sun will turn to darkness and the moon to blood!
