1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,764
绝不手下留情!
There will be no mercy!

2
00:00:07,102 --> 00:00:10,537
我妹妹的独子正被钉在十字架上!
My sister's only child hanging from a cross!

3
00:00:10,539 --> 00:00:13,006
- 约瑟...  - 我们需要的是结束这一切!
- Joseph...  - We need this to end!

4
00:00:13,008 --> 00:00:15,308
我们要根据我们的法律来管理自己
We must govern ourselves

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,712
这样我们将不再受到罗马法律的制裁
so that we are never again subjected to Roman justice.

6
00:00:18,714 --> 00:00:20,947
你一点有用的事也没做
You did nothing of any worth whatsoever.

7
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:23,250
给安提帕王让路
Make way for King Antipas.

8
00:00:23,252 --> 00:00:26,052
你的地位仰赖于我的认可
Your position is reliant on my endorsement.

9
00:00:26,054 --> 00:00:29,823
约翰 我有着同样贫苦的灵魂
John, I'm poor and sick in my soul.

10
00:00:29,825 --> 00:00:31,892
很高兴现在送给了你们这块地
I'm glad to give you this land.

11
00:00:31,894 --> 00:00:33,260
巴拿巴 再好不过了
Barnabas, it's perfect.

12
00:00:33,262 --> 00:00:35,462
神给我们每个人都有旨意 我应该去传道
God has a purpose for each of us. I'm meant to preach.

13
00:00:35,464 --> 00:00:37,431
耐心点 司提反 时机会到的
Be patient, Stephen. The time will come.

14
00:00:37,433 --> 00:00:40,233
难道耶稣没有在你将他处死而他又复活前说过
And didn't Jesus say, "I will rebuild this temple in three days"

15
00:00:40,235 --> 00:00:42,636
"我能拆毁神的殿"吗?!
before he rose from the death you condemned him to?

16
00:00:42,638 --> 00:00:44,337
让他安静 让他闭嘴
Silence him. Shut him up.

17
00:00:44,339 --> 00:00:46,706
求主耶稣接收我的灵魂
Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.

00:01:15,937 --> 00:01:21,975
"你地上不再听见强暴的事
"No longer will violence be heard in your lands,

26
00:01:21,977 --> 00:01:27,747
境内不再听见荒凉毁灭的事
nor ruin and destruction within your borders.

27
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:34,955
你必称你的墙为拯救
Your walls shall be called salvation,

28
00:01:34,957 --> 00:01:39,793
称你的门为赞美
and your gates praise.

29
00:01:39,795 --> 00:01:46,867
日头不再作你白昼的光
No longer will the sun light your days

30
00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:50,937
月亮也不再发光照耀你
nor the moon bright your night.

31
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:56,776
耶和华却要作你永远的光
You will have the Lord for everlasting light

32
00:01:56,778 --> 00:02:01,047
你神要为你的荣耀"
and your God for your glory."

33
00:02:14,695 --> 00:02:18,431
我的儿子死了! 司提反死了!
My son is dead! Stephen is dead!

34
00:02:18,433 --> 00:02:22,836
都是因为你! 你和你的政治斗争!
Because of you! You and your politics!

35
00:02:22,838 --> 00:02:24,204
他在哪儿?
Where is he?

36
00:02:24,206 --> 00:02:28,341
你的弥赛亚如今又在哪儿!
Where is he now, this Messiah of yours?

37
00:02:42,456 --> 00:02:45,058
为什么他不叫司提反从死里复活
Why doesn't he raise him up

38
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,929
或是让主把司提反带回我们身边?
or ask the Lord to bring Stephen back to us?

39
00:02:48,931 --> 00:02:51,431
是为了我们而试验他吗?
Is it for us to test him?

40
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,872
我昨晚梦见
I dreamt last night

41
00:02:58,874 --> 00:03:01,475
还会有人像司提反一样牺牲
that Stephen wouldn't be the last of us to die.

42
00:03:05,947 --> 00:03:08,448
又一个听了道的饥渴的灵魂
Another hungry soul that's heard the word.

43
00:03:10,785 --> 00:03:13,920
愿神与你同在
God be with you.

44
00:03:13,922 --> 00:03:16,623
你是来听耶稣的道吗?
Have you come to hear the word of Jesus?

45
00:03:17,626 --> 00:03:19,893
不是
No.

46
00:03:19,895 --> 00:03:22,662
我名叫扫罗
I am Saul.

47
00:03:22,664 --> 00:03:26,700
我是名学者 犹太人 罗马公民 法利赛人 
Scholar, Jew, Roman citizen, Pharisee,

48
00:03:26,702 --> 00:03:29,169
耶路撒冷伟大神殿的保卫者
defender of the great temple of Jerusalem.

49
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:31,371
我是来教你们一个道理
I have come to teach you of the wrath

50
00:03:31,373 --> 00:03:33,707
若你们不停止那些亵渎神灵的话
you will all bring down upon yourselves

51
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:37,010
会有什么样的震怒降临到你们身上
if you do not end your blasphemy.

52
00:03:41,082 --> 00:03:42,349
如若不然
If.

53
00:03:50,792 --> 00:03:55,395
旷野和干旱之地必然欢喜
The desert and the parched land will be glad.

54
00:03:58,733 --> 00:04:02,068
沙漠也必快乐...
The wilderness will rejoice...

55
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:10,271
又像玫瑰开花
and blossom; Like the crocus,

56
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:13,747
必开花繁盛
it will burst into bloom.

57
00:04:13,749 --> 00:04:18,084
乐上加乐...
It will rejoice greatly...

58
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:24,658
而且欢呼
and shout for joy.

59
00:04:44,312 --> 00:04:45,545
那么 跟我们说说
So, tell us,

60
00:04:45,547 --> 00:04:47,681
我们的信念到底有什么错?
how are we so wrong in our belief?

61
00:04:49,684 --> 00:04:52,652
朋友 说话呀
Friend, speak with us.

62
00:04:52,654 --> 00:04:57,157
怎么了 你是没有舌头吗?
What's the matter, have you no tongue?

63
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:59,559
还是没有脑子?
Or no brain?

64
00:04:59,561 --> 00:05:02,129
拿撒勒人耶稣
Jesus of Nazareth,

65
00:05:02,131 --> 00:05:06,666
你们喜爱并赞美的这个乡巴佬弥赛亚
this peasant Messiah you love and praise,

66
00:05:06,668 --> 00:05:11,505
不过就是个假先知而已
is nothing more than a false prophet.

67
00:05:15,476 --> 00:05:19,880
你竟敢来这里说这番话?
You dare come here and say that?

68
00:05:19,882 --> 00:05:22,716
不是我说的 是犹太公会说的
I don't say it. The Sanhedrin says it.

69
00:05:22,718 --> 00:05:24,518
是所罗门王的诗章里说的
The psalms of Solomon say it.

70
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,888
是耶利米书 以赛亚书和但以理书里的预言说的
The prophecies of Jeremiah, Isaiah, and Daniel say it.

71
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:31,191
要不然又该是谁说的呢?
Who are you to say otherwise?

72
00:05:31,193 --> 00:05:33,927
谁?
Who?

73
00:05:33,929 --> 00:05:36,496
哦
Oh.

74
00:05:36,498 --> 00:05:38,865
怎么了?
What's the matter?

75
00:05:38,867 --> 00:05:41,368
你没有舌头吗?
Have you no tongue?

76
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,038
还是没有胆子?
No courage?

77
00:05:49,344 --> 00:05:52,379
走开吧 矮子
Be gone, little man.

78
00:06:11,086 --> 00:06:13,052
我不明白 约拿单
I don't understand you, Jonathan.

79
00:06:13,054 --> 00:06:15,822
你看见了那场大屠杀 一波接一波的十字架刑罚
You saw the slaughter, the wave of crucifixions,

80
00:06:15,824 --> 00:06:18,758
也见识了耶路撒冷城里一刻不停的骚乱
saw what bloody turmoil made its home in Jerusalem.

81
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,927
当然 父亲 我又不是瞎子
Of course. Father, I'm not blind.

82
00:06:20,929 --> 00:06:23,730
那你还接受作为一个大祭司 该亚法居然 
And you accept that Caiaphas, as high priest,

83
00:06:23,732 --> 00:06:25,565
任由血流成海
stands knee-deep in blood.

84
00:06:25,567 --> 00:06:30,470
这是彼拉多手持罗马权利之剑所杀出的一片血海
Blood spilled by Pilate wielding the power of Rome.

85
00:06:30,472 --> 00:06:35,308
诚然 我认为该亚法没处理好这件事
Yes, I accept Caiaphas has not handled things well.

86
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,878
那你为什么不同意必须找人取代他?
So, why can't you accept that he must be replaced?

87
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,548
耶路撒冷需要有个人
Jerusalem needs a man who will forge

88
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,117
能和罗马帝国建立起全新的关系
a different relationship with Rome

89
00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:45,785
能带领我们重回该亚法曾经代表的
to take us back to the peaceful times

90
00:06:45,787 --> 00:06:47,387
和平年代
Caiaphas once stood for.

91
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:53,626
犹太公会在找人取代该亚法的地位
The Sanhedrin is looking for a man to challenge Caiaphas.

92
00:06:53,628 --> 00:06:59,099
我们亚那家族希望这个人是你
The Annas family needs that man to be you.

93
00:07:04,005 --> 00:07:08,341
让你亲爱的一家人
The whole idea of your loving family

94
00:07:08,343 --> 00:07:11,277
都聚到我们家里来祈祷感恩
gathered in our house to give thanks

95
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:12,946
这件事恕我无法理解
gives me indigestion.

96
00:07:12,948 --> 00:07:15,915
喝点药 清醒下头脑 
Well, take a potion. Clear your head.

97
00:07:19,454 --> 00:07:21,821
两位尊贵的客人不请自来了
Two guests of honor have invited themselves.

98
00:07:21,823 --> 00:07:25,492
其实早一点通知我们也没什么坏处
Although a little more notice wouldn't have hurt.

99
00:07:25,494 --> 00:07:27,761
安提帕和希罗底
Antipas and Herodias.

100
00:07:37,805 --> 00:07:40,540
我不知道拿撒勒人的营地
I had no idea the Nazarene camp

101
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:42,475
居然离城里这么近
was so close to the city.

102
00:07:42,477 --> 00:07:44,344
还这么繁荣
And so populated.

103
00:07:44,346 --> 00:07:46,613
怎么会有人抛弃熟悉的一切
Why would anyone leave everything they knew

104
00:07:46,615 --> 00:07:48,615
去过这样的生活?
to live like that?

105
00:07:51,386 --> 00:07:54,421
因为普珥节您能光临寒舍
We are honored the festival of Purim

106
00:07:54,423 --> 00:07:56,923
我们倍感荣幸
has brought you to our home.

107
00:07:56,925 --> 00:07:59,692
确实 用这作为来耶路撒冷的借口倒是挺有用
In truth, it was a useful excuse to come to Jerusalem.

108
00:07:59,694 --> 00:08:02,495
来看看这座城是否还屹立不倒
To see if the city was still standing.

109
00:08:04,432 --> 00:08:06,399
我的儿子和我觉得
My son and I think,

110
00:08:06,401 --> 00:08:10,603
同为犹太人 我们可以开诚布公地谈谈最近这段黑暗的时期
as Jews, we can talk honestly about recent dark days.

111
00:08:12,606 --> 00:08:16,076
人民没法很快淡忘彼拉多巡抚
The people will not soon forget the blood spilled

112
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,244
在多起十字架刑罚中屠杀的人命
in Governor Pilate's wave of crucifixions.

113
00:08:18,246 --> 00:08:19,979
他们也不应该忘记
They shouldn't forget.

114
00:08:19,981 --> 00:08:22,415
但是真的有某个时期人民是心满意足的吗?
But was there ever a time when the people were content?

115
00:08:22,417 --> 00:08:25,385
要是民众的怒火减息
If the anger of the people was fading,

116
00:08:25,387 --> 00:08:27,620
那你们这种自鸣得意的处理方式就还有用
there would be room for this complacent approach.

117
00:08:27,622 --> 00:08:29,656
父亲 我们几乎从未自鸣得意
Father, we are hardly complacent.

118
00:08:33,794 --> 00:08:35,562
但是怒火是在增长
But the anger is growing,

119
00:08:35,564 --> 00:08:38,331
就好像沙漠里新兴的帐篷城市在增长一样
just as the new city of tents out in the desert is growing.

120
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,266
- 你是说那个营地吗?  - 唔
- You mean the camp?  - Hm.

121
00:08:40,268 --> 00:08:41,735
那里现在有数千之众了吧
There are thousands there now.

122
00:08:41,737 --> 00:08:42,769
没错
Yes.

123
00:08:42,771 --> 00:08:45,238
我们在来的路上经过了
We passed it on our way here.

124
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,639
人多到什么时候才会停止?
Where will it stop?

125
00:08:46,641 --> 00:08:48,508
五千教徒?
At 5,000 converts?

126
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,476
还是一万?
100,000?

127
00:08:49,478 --> 00:08:51,077
大家能不能别再
Will everybody please stop

128
00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:53,446
谈论那些人了?
going on about these people?

129
00:09:10,565 --> 00:09:12,832
说吧 你们究竟想让我干什么?
Tell me, what exactly is it that you'd have me do?

130
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:16,169
嗯?
Hmm?

131
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:19,272
把他们在帐篷里就地屠杀?
Have them slaughtered in their tents?

132
00:09:23,611 --> 00:09:26,646
安提帕 诚然人民... 
Antipas, surely, the people...

133
00:09:26,648 --> 00:09:28,982
以及作为他们统治者的您...
and you, as their ruler...

134
00:09:28,984 --> 00:09:32,052
想要看到一个能控制事态发展
want to see a high priest in control of events.

135
00:09:32,054 --> 00:09:35,488
而不是随波逐流的大祭司
Not led by them.

136
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:39,859
不是罗马大人一声令下 就言听计从的大祭司
Not governed by the whim of his Roman master.

137
00:09:51,305 --> 00:09:54,340
我确实很享受空气中弥漫的背叛的硝烟
I do enjoy the smell of treachery.

138
00:09:54,342 --> 00:09:56,443
可怜的老该亚法看起来就像
Poor old Caiaphas has the look of a man

139
00:09:56,445 --> 00:09:57,911
马上要上刑场一样
preparing to face the executioner.

140
00:09:57,913 --> 00:09:59,379
如果要在
If it was a choice

141
00:09:59,381 --> 00:10:02,916
他和年轻的约拿单中选一个做大祭司
between him and young Jonathan as high priest,

142
00:10:02,918 --> 00:10:05,318
我还真不知道我选谁好
I don't know who I'd go for.

143
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,720
两个都不想选
Neither.

144
00:10:06,722 --> 00:10:09,489
但我不得不支持其中一个
But I'll have to give my support to one of them,

145
00:10:09,491 --> 00:10:11,591
然后让彼拉多担起责任来
and then let Pilate have the responsibility.

146
00:10:11,593 --> 00:10:14,494
夫人请
My lady.

147
00:10:14,496 --> 00:10:18,465
后来有个叫撒迦利的别是巴人
And then there was Zachary of Beersheba,

148
00:10:18,467 --> 00:10:21,034
一个满怀激情的人 想要遵循
a passionate man who tried to follow

149
00:10:21,036 --> 00:10:23,169
摩西的先例
the example of Moses

150
00:10:23,171 --> 00:10:25,939
带领他的朋友们穿过红海
and lead his friends across the red sea.

151
00:10:25,941 --> 00:10:28,775
他淹死了 他们也淹死了
He drowned, and so did they.

152
00:10:28,777 --> 00:10:32,112
后来又有个从佩里亚来的西门...
And then there was Simon from Peraea...

153
00:10:32,114 --> 00:10:34,080
大胆勇敢 用心良苦的西门
Brave, well-intentioned Simon.

154
00:10:35,484 --> 00:10:37,350
他坚信他是神派来的
Well, he believed that he was sent by God

155
00:10:37,352 --> 00:10:40,787
结果却让犹太人的生活...
but only made a Jew's life ha...

156
00:10:40,789 --> 00:10:46,226
却让犹太人的生活比在罗马统治下更不堪
But only made a Jew's life harder under Rome.

157
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:49,562
后来还有一个装模作样的人...
And there was another pretender...

158
00:10:49,564 --> 00:10:56,536
一个从加利利来的骗子 叫耶稣的人
An imposter from Galilee, this man Jesus.

159
00:10:56,538 --> 00:10:59,472
你就是彼得 我听过你传道
You're Peter. I've heard you preach.

160
00:10:59,474 --> 00:11:00,840
讲得不错
You do it well.

161
00:11:00,842 --> 00:11:03,610
可能有点过于仁慈 不过...
A little softhearted, perhaps, but...

162
00:11:06,113 --> 00:11:08,682
我有充分的理由反对你们那个假冒的弥赛亚!
I have a case to make against your false Messiah!

163
00:11:08,684 --> 00:11:10,350
你想听听看吗 彼得
Do you want to hear it, Peter,

164
00:11:10,352 --> 00:11:13,553
还是你怕我在这群容易受骗的信众前
or are you afraid I will unpick your delusions

165
00:11:13,555 --> 00:11:15,889
戳穿你的谎言?
in front of this gullible crowd?

166
00:11:15,891 --> 00:11:17,857
这个人活在黑暗中
This man is living in darkness

167
00:11:17,859 --> 00:11:20,427
竟不知自己的眼是闭着的
and doesn't even know his eyes are closed.

168
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,796
他宣扬这些话
He claims such knowledge,

169
00:11:22,798 --> 00:11:24,531
却不过是在黑暗中蹒跚而行
but he's just stumbling in the dark

170
00:11:24,533 --> 00:11:26,199
如果他不明白...
if he doesn't know this...

171
00:11:26,201 --> 00:11:31,638
不靠着耶稣 谁也无法进到父面前
no one can come to the father except through Jesus.

172
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:37,410
耶稣便是那路 是真理 是生命
Jesus is the way and the truth and the life.

173
00:11:37,412 --> 00:11:40,013
你们那个耶稣
This Jesus of yours

174
00:11:40,015 --> 00:11:43,984
不过是个目不识丁的渔夫
is nothing more than a false prophet

175
00:11:43,986 --> 00:11:46,086
冒充先知
of illiterate fishermen.

176
00:11:46,088 --> 00:11:49,022
他让你们陷在他编制的谎言中
He has you all in a net of lies.

177
00:11:49,024 --> 00:11:51,291
约翰!
John!

178
00:11:53,194 --> 00:11:59,466
你听起来就像是个商人在叫卖石头
You use words like a trader selling stones.

179
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:03,169
没有用心 没有爱
There's no heart to them, no love.

180
00:12:03,171 --> 00:12:06,272
我有... 爱
I have... love

181
00:12:06,274 --> 00:12:08,808
对那些你妄图毁灭的东西有爱...
for those things you want to destroy...

182
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:11,077
耶路撒冷城中心的神殿
the temple in the heart of Jerusalem.

183
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:13,013
流传百世的律法和传统
Centuries of law and tradition

184
00:12:13,015 --> 00:12:15,515
你们这群可怜虫妄图取而代之
your pathetic little band can no more replace

185
00:12:15,517 --> 00:12:18,818
却不过是螳臂当车
than a flea can fill the shoes of a man.

186
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,320
说简单点
Speak simply.

187
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,355
要是你的想法但凡有一点道理
If there is truth to your thoughts,

188
00:12:22,357 --> 00:12:24,324
大家便会明白你
you'll be understood.

189
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:27,360
告诉你个简单的道理...
Here's a simple truth...

190
00:12:27,362 --> 00:12:32,432
要是你站在神殿的对立面
If you set yourself against the temple,

191
00:12:32,434 --> 00:12:36,736
你就会被神殿毁灭
you will be destroyed by the temple.

192
00:12:36,738 --> 00:12:38,138
简单的
Simple.

193
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:41,675
道理
Truth.

194
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,277
就算我能说服犹太公会
Even if I could persuade the Sanhedrin

195
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:45,779
信任你的家族
to trust your family,

196
00:12:45,781 --> 00:12:48,281
即使你们在我们的人民一个个
who stood by while more and more

197
00:12:48,283 --> 00:12:50,216
被钉上十字架时也仅是袖手旁观
of our people were crucified.

198
00:12:50,218 --> 00:12:52,552
- 我们也无计可施...  - 就算我愿意
- There was nothing...  - And even if I was willing to speak

199
00:12:52,554 --> 00:12:54,387
替你辩解来获取你取代该亚法
in your defense and so gain for you

200
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:56,523
所必需的支持
the support you'll need to unseat Caiaphas

201
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:59,159
来治愈你所造成的创伤
and heal the wounds you've caused,

202
00:12:59,161 --> 00:13:01,294
但你密谋反对自己的女婿
have you no shame

203
00:13:01,296 --> 00:13:03,563
难道你就一点不感到羞耻?
that you'd plot against your own son-in-law?

204
00:13:03,565 --> 00:13:06,232
我感到羞耻
I have shame.

205
00:13:06,234 --> 00:13:08,902
为我没能早点行动
Shame that I didn't act sooner

206
00:13:08,904 --> 00:13:11,705
把他们从苦痛中解救出来而羞耻
to save so many from their pain.

207
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,741
那些死去的人 那些像你一样
Those who died and those, like you,

208
00:13:14,743 --> 00:13:17,877
失去挚爱的人
who lost the ones they loved.

209
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:21,414
我们请求你不要让这一次的失败
We ask you to not let that failing

210
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:24,384
再导致更多的流血与苦难
cost more blood and suffering,

211
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:29,189
不要错失我们可以重新开始的良机
not to let the moment pass when we can act to start afresh.

212
00:13:29,191 --> 00:13:32,459
我的儿子约拿单是个正直的人
My son Jonathan is a man of integrity

213
00:13:32,461 --> 00:13:35,562
会真正代表耶路撒冷的人民发声
who will truly speak for the people of Jerusalem.

214
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,497
是唯一一个能同时带来改变...
The only man who can bring both...

215
00:13:43,437 --> 00:13:46,206
并能使之延续的人
both change and continuity.

216
00:13:50,444 --> 00:13:53,079
在你把这个方案提交给彼拉多之前
Before you even think of making the case to Pilate,

217
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:55,415
得让安提帕毫无保留地支持他才行
he'll need the unreserved backing of Antipas.

218
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:59,119
彼拉多为了维护秩序 会想要他的支持
Pilate will want his approval to maintain order.

219
00:13:59,121 --> 00:14:01,955
要是在你的支持下 我们能联合
If, with your support, we can unite

220
00:14:01,957 --> 00:14:05,992
犹太公会的话 我们今天就可以去说服安提帕
the Sanhedrin behind us, we can approach Antipas today.

221
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,236
你不会后悔的 我保证
You won't regret this, I promise.

222
00:14:18,172 --> 00:14:25,412
这个人要让你们相信一个被钉上十字架的弥赛亚
This man would have you believe in a crucified Messiah.

223
00:14:25,414 --> 00:14:26,947
申命记里说
Deuteronomy says,

224
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:30,850
"被挂在木头上或十字架上的人
"for he that is hanged on a tree or on a cross

225
00:14:30,852 --> 00:14:32,752
是在神面前受咒诅的"
is accursed of God."

226
00:14:32,754 --> 00:14:34,354
但是神让他复活了
But God raised him up,

227
00:14:34,356 --> 00:14:37,424
叫他摆脱了死亡的痛苦
having loosed him from the pains of death

228
00:14:37,426 --> 00:14:39,793
因为他必不会被死亡所缠绕
because it was not possible he should be held by it.

229
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:40,994
你这么说而已
So you claim,

230
00:14:40,996 --> 00:14:43,830
但是你们中有谁见他复活?
but who among you has seen the resurrection?

231
00:14:43,832 --> 00:14:45,799
谁?
Who?

232
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:46,866
你吗?
You?

233
00:14:46,868 --> 00:14:49,135
你? 还是你?
You? You?

234
00:14:49,137 --> 00:14:52,439
只有这帮江湖骗子 他们需要你们相信这件事
Only your charlatans, who need you to believe it.

235
00:14:52,441 --> 00:14:57,110
耶稣和他福音里的真理是蒙人所爱的
Jesus and the truth of his message are loved.

236
00:14:57,112 --> 00:14:59,379
蒙世人所爱吗?
By all our people?

237
00:14:59,381 --> 00:15:01,715
甚至连全耶路撒冷的人也不都爱他
Not even by all of Jerusalem.

238
00:15:01,717 --> 00:15:06,319
他们根本不爱他... 他们处决了他
They loved him so little... They executed him.

239
00:15:06,321 --> 00:15:09,556
然后让以赛亚的预言得以成真
And fulfilled Isaiah's prophecy.

240
00:15:09,558 --> 00:15:14,494
弥赛亚多受痛苦 常经忧患
The Messiah is a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.

241
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:18,064
这个人竟将你们所爱之人被处决
This man thinks it's a mark of success

242
00:15:18,066 --> 00:15:22,402
视为胜利的标志
when those you love are executed.

243
00:15:22,404 --> 00:15:27,073
等到你们全死了 他才会开心...
He won't be happy until you're all dead...

244
00:15:27,075 --> 00:15:28,708
就好像司提反
Like Stephen.

245
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,244
你要再多呆一秒钟
If you stay here one moment longer,

246
00:15:31,246 --> 00:15:34,047
我发誓我要把你的头拧下来
I swear I'm going to tear your head off.

247
00:15:37,485 --> 00:15:40,186
别担心
Don't worry.

248
00:15:40,188 --> 00:15:43,390
我已经听明白了 讲道理是没法把你们
I've heard enough to see that reason won't break you

249
00:15:43,392 --> 00:15:44,591
从痴心妄想中解救出来的
from your delusions.

250
00:15:44,593 --> 00:15:47,327
不过你还会再见到我的
You will see me again, though.

251
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:51,064
等着瞧吧
Be sure of that.

252
00:15:59,143 --> 00:16:01,444
迦玛列拉比
Rabbi Gamaliel,

253
00:16:01,446 --> 00:16:03,580
为何沙漠里那群亵渎神明之人
how can these blasphemers in the desert

254
00:16:03,582 --> 00:16:06,816
想让这一切都结束?
want to end all this?

255
00:16:06,818 --> 00:16:09,719
别操心他们了
Don't concern yourself with them.

256
00:16:09,721 --> 00:16:12,021
专注你自己的研究
Look to your own studies.

257
00:16:12,023 --> 00:16:13,890
提高你的悟性 然后... 
Improve your understanding, and then...

258
00:16:13,892 --> 00:16:15,425
没错 但他们就是看不到
Yes, but they just don't see

259
00:16:15,427 --> 00:16:17,761
这些... 这一切...
that this... all of this...

260
00:16:17,763 --> 00:16:19,996
就是耶路撒冷的精髓与灵魂之所在
is the heart and soul of Jerusalem.

261
00:16:22,433 --> 00:16:24,801
我试过告诉他们 但他们就是不明白事理
I tried to tell them, but they just won't see reason.

262
00:16:24,803 --> 00:16:28,371
那么 扫罗 别把你的精力浪费在
Then, Saul, don't spend more of your energy

263
00:16:28,373 --> 00:16:30,807
试图矫正他们的错误上
trying to correct their mistake.

264
00:16:30,809 --> 00:16:34,744
我能看见你从学者到拉比的晋升之路
I see a path for you from scholar to rabbi,

265
00:16:34,746 --> 00:16:40,617
也许还能从拉比晋升到犹太公会里去
from rabbi to, perhaps, a seat on the Sanhedrin.

266
00:16:40,619 --> 00:16:43,186
谁知道呢?
Who knows?

267
00:16:43,188 --> 00:16:45,789
这些人
These men,

268
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:48,925
他们和犹太公会所做的是一件事
they do the same work as the Sanhedrin.

269
00:16:48,927 --> 00:16:51,394
他们干苦工 来保护这些古老的东西
They toil to preserve the old

270
00:16:51,396 --> 00:16:52,962
将之修缮一新
while making it new.

271
00:16:52,964 --> 00:16:56,833
而那个渔夫彼得还有那帮子人
What this fisherman Peter and the others want to do

272
00:16:56,835 --> 00:16:58,335
只想毁掉旧东西
is destroy the old,

273
00:16:58,337 --> 00:17:02,105
以新代之
replace it with the new.

274
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:06,509
我得想办法阻止他们
I have to find a way to stop them.

275
00:17:06,511 --> 00:17:08,244
我必须这么做
I have to.

276
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:13,850
刚才那番话谈得不错
I think that went well.

277
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:31,067
送给您的
For you.

278
00:17:31,069 --> 00:17:32,602
周年纪念礼物
An anniversary gift.

279
00:17:32,604 --> 00:17:34,471
您离开后
After you left our house,

280
00:17:34,473 --> 00:17:37,974
我夫人提醒我 正是在十年前的普珥节
my wife reminded me that it was at Purim 10 years ago

281
00:17:37,976 --> 00:17:39,309
我们第一次见面
that we first met.

282
00:17:39,311 --> 00:17:40,810
我作为大祭司
Me as high priest,

283
00:17:40,812 --> 00:17:43,913
而您则是加利利和佩里亚的领主
you as tetrarch of Galilee and Peraea.

284
00:17:43,915 --> 00:17:45,849
彼此都想理解对方的所作所为
Each trying to work the other out.

285
00:17:45,851 --> 00:17:49,552
而如今的我们仍在就此努力
And here we are, still trying.

286
00:17:49,554 --> 00:17:50,787
请坐
Please.

287
00:17:52,456 --> 00:17:56,660
这么说 你的岳父和他儿子
So, your father-in-law and his son

288
00:17:56,662 --> 00:17:59,029
十分想要从你手里拿走
would very much like to take from you

289
00:17:59,031 --> 00:18:02,999
你所穿的这套华丽的公职袍服
those fine robes of office that you wear.

290
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:06,436
现在... 
Now...

291
00:18:06,438 --> 00:18:08,171
你准备怎么对付
what are you going to do

292
00:18:08,173 --> 00:18:10,740
沙漠里那帮信徒?
about these fanatics in the desert?

293
00:18:10,742 --> 00:18:12,776
这帮狂徒的首领 他们所追随的那个人
The ringleader of the cult, the man they follow,

294
00:18:12,778 --> 00:18:14,444
来自加利利
is from Galilee.

295
00:18:14,446 --> 00:18:17,547
这可让我颜面尽失
This reflects very badly on me.

296
00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:20,650
追随他们所谓的弥赛亚
They will soon tire of the hardships

297
00:18:20,652 --> 00:18:24,054
所吃的苦头很快就会让他们放弃的
that come from following their... Messiah.

298
00:18:24,056 --> 00:18:25,522
但会发生什么事呢?
But what happens?

299
00:18:25,524 --> 00:18:28,324
异见变成起义
Dissent becomes revolt.

300
00:18:28,326 --> 00:18:31,127
罗马帝国的回应可能会是灾难性的
The Roman response could be devastating.

301
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:36,466
替我解决掉这件事吧 该亚法
Solve this problem for me, Caiaphas.

302
00:18:36,468 --> 00:18:40,437
要是他们想推翻你的事报到彼拉多那
And if this attempt to overthrow you reaches Pilate,

303
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:42,739
我会支持你的
you will have my support.

304
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:49,979
我们知道你
We know you're conspiring

305
00:18:49,981 --> 00:18:51,681
和我的父亲及兄长有所密谋
with my father and brother.

306
00:18:53,784 --> 00:18:55,819
我不明白你在说什么?
Should I know what you're talking about?

307
00:18:55,821 --> 00:18:59,089
你们三个人是赢不了这场斗争的
The three of you won't win this fight.

308
00:18:59,091 --> 00:19:01,858
我的丈夫会继续留在大祭司的位置上
My husband will remain in office as high priest,

309
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,194
而你会为你的背叛付出代价
and you will suffer for your betrayal.

310
00:19:04,196 --> 00:19:06,262
形势开始对你丈夫不利了
Tide is turning against your husband,

311
00:19:06,264 --> 00:19:08,164
我也只能顺应潮流
and I can't stand in the way of it.

312
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,333
如果你认识不到这一点
If you don't recognize that,

313
00:19:10,335 --> 00:19:11,768
你们都会被这股浪潮所吞没
you'll both drown in the flood.

314
00:19:16,474 --> 00:19:18,775
大祭司今天要处理的公务
The high priest has more to deal with today

315
00:19:18,777 --> 00:19:20,076
多得你无法想象
than you can even imagine.

316
00:19:20,078 --> 00:19:21,778
你觉得我应该把他带到这里
And you think that I should bring him

317
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,113
- 跟你说话?  - 是的
- out here to talk to you?  - Yes.

318
00:19:23,115 --> 00:19:25,315
你三天之后再回来
Come back in three days.

319
00:19:25,317 --> 00:19:27,183
我的回答还是一样的
The answer will still be the same,

320
00:19:27,185 --> 00:19:29,319
但至少能给我时间忘掉你
but at least it'll give me chance to forget you.

321
00:19:31,222 --> 00:19:34,157
三天之后 神殿面临的危险就会翻倍了
In three days, the danger to the temple could be doubled.

322
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:35,658
什么危险?
What danger to the temple?

323
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,395
请原谅 我...
Forgive me. I...

324
00:19:38,397 --> 00:19:41,231
我只是在说那个假冒的弥赛亚的信众
I was merely talking about the followers of the false Messiah

325
00:19:41,233 --> 00:19:43,433
聚集在沙漠里
gathering in the desert.

326
00:19:48,906 --> 00:19:49,939
跟我来
Come with me.

327
00:19:49,941 --> 00:19:52,842
你想要见我吗?
You wanted to see me?

328
00:19:52,844 --> 00:19:54,578
谢谢您拨冗接见我
Thank you for your good grace.

329
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,780
我在神殿的藏书阁里
Having read much in the temple archives

330
00:19:56,782 --> 00:19:58,615
读过很多您家族的伟大历史
of your family's great history,

331
00:19:58,617 --> 00:20:01,084
我尊敬地希望...
I hope that, with respect...

332
00:20:01,086 --> 00:20:03,853
我们能不能少谈一点尊敬?
Could we perhaps have a little less respect?

333
00:20:03,855 --> 00:20:06,089
- 我们都有生老病死  - 当然
- Time kills us all.  - Of course.

334
00:20:10,095 --> 00:20:13,663
我想我们有一个相同的利益
I believe we share a common interest,

335
00:20:13,665 --> 00:20:15,198
一个相同的渴望
a common desire

336
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,169
帮耶路撒冷除掉一个害虫...
to rid Jerusalem of a pest...

337
00:20:19,171 --> 00:20:21,171
那群渔夫和他们的追随者
The fishermen and their followers

338
00:20:21,173 --> 00:20:22,839
在城墙之外
growing in numbers and confidence

339
00:20:22,841 --> 00:20:24,941
默默地不断壮大
outside the city walls.

340
00:20:24,943 --> 00:20:30,447
那你为何这么迫切希望让他们消失呢?
And what is it that fuels your desire to see them gone?

341
00:20:30,449 --> 00:20:31,781
他们惹恼我了
They offend me.

342
00:20:31,783 --> 00:20:34,818
他们想摧毁神殿的行径
Their actions to undermine the temple,

343
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,519
他们的挑衅行为惹恼我了
their defiance offends me.

344
00:20:36,521 --> 00:20:38,488
他们对犹太公会的蔑视
Their defiance of the Sanhedrin,

345
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,590
犹太公会本应该执行更严厉的裁决
who could not have been more definitive in their verdict

346
00:20:40,592 --> 00:20:41,825
当他们说...
when they said...

347
00:20:46,864 --> 00:20:48,765
你到底想要什么?
What exactly do you want?

348
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:52,736
您授权... 我代表您行动
The authority to... act on your behalf

349
00:20:52,738 --> 00:20:55,872
去解决这个问题...
and solve this problem...

350
00:20:55,874 --> 00:20:59,109
把这些渎神者彻底扫除
To remove these blasphemers so completely

351
00:20:59,111 --> 00:21:03,413
只言片语也不能留下
that not even the stain of their memory is left behind.

352
00:21:15,603 --> 00:21:18,237
我就是忍不住想起司提反
I just can't stop thinking about Stephen.

353
00:21:20,406 --> 00:21:23,575
别这样了
Stop being such a man.

354
00:21:23,577 --> 00:21:24,877
什么?
What?

355
00:21:24,879 --> 00:21:27,946
你看到那些在葬礼上的女人了吗?
You see the women at the funeral?

356
00:21:27,948 --> 00:21:30,716
她们哭泣 她们哀嚎
They weep and they wail

357
00:21:30,718 --> 00:21:33,485
把她们的痛苦都喊出来
and they scream out their pain

358
00:21:33,487 --> 00:21:35,554
让全世界都知道
so the whole world knows about it.

359
00:21:35,556 --> 00:21:40,225
在这些人敞开心胸表达哀恸的时候
And while all this openhearted grieving goes on,

360
00:21:40,227 --> 00:21:42,861
男人们却低头看着脚
the men look at their feet

361
00:21:42,863 --> 00:21:46,565
一副愁眉苦脸的样子
and put on their sad face.

362
00:21:51,437 --> 00:21:54,039
不要闷在心里
Don't bottle it up.

363
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,874
把痛苦释放出来
Let out that pain.

364
00:21:55,876 --> 00:22:00,245
彼得 领导我们才是纪念司提反最好的方式
Honor Stephen by leading us, Peter.

365
00:22:20,467 --> 00:22:23,835
我需要您授予我权力
What I need is for you to give me the authority

366
00:22:23,837 --> 00:22:27,639
和最低级的神殿守卫一样大的权力就行
you would give the least promoted of your temple guard.

367
00:22:27,641 --> 00:22:29,408
你要怎么用这个权力?
Authority to use how?

368
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:30,676
我还要二十个神殿守卫
And 20 men from that guard.

369
00:22:30,678 --> 00:22:35,581
- 啊!  - 他们的力量就在于他们很受拥戴
- Aah!  - Their strength is their popularity.

370
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:38,717
我要把这个夺走
I want to take that from them.

371
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,428
你们心中有疑问
You have questions.

372
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:53,866
你们说 "为什么他称我为他的磐石?"
You say, "why did he call me his rock?"

373
00:22:53,868 --> 00:22:57,536
你们问 "我是那个根基吗?"
You ask, "am I the foundation?"

374
00:22:57,538 --> 00:23:01,607
"这里是建造他教会的地方吗?"
"Is this where his church will be built?"

375
00:23:01,609 --> 00:23:05,544
这里只有一块作根基的石头
There is only one foundation stone.

376
00:23:05,546 --> 00:23:09,147
他的姓名便是耶稣基督!
And his name is Jesus Christ!

377
00:23:09,149 --> 00:23:11,216
他的教会也不在这里
And his church is not here.

378
00:23:11,218 --> 00:23:14,286
不在于那些帐篷 或是这些高墙
It's not in those tents or these walls.

379
00:23:14,288 --> 00:23:18,323
而在于你们... 你们所有人
It's you... all of you.

380
00:23:18,325 --> 00:23:22,594
你们便是他的教会
You are his church.

381
00:23:22,596 --> 00:23:25,063
就像那些就算没有亲眼见他复活
And like those we ask to believe

382
00:23:25,065 --> 00:23:28,100
我们也要让其相信的人一样
even though they didn't see him rise again,

383
00:23:28,102 --> 00:23:30,969
即使面前是刀山火海
we must push away our fear

384
00:23:30,971 --> 00:23:35,674
我们仍要无畏前行
even as we recognize the persecution we face.

385
00:23:37,311 --> 00:23:42,548
我们必须去耶路撒冷 去传他的道
We have to go to Jerusalem and preach the word

386
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:45,551
去建造起他的教会!
to build his church!

387
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,560
你自己招人
Recruit your own men.

388
00:24:02,268 --> 00:24:04,002
我来付钱
I'll pay.

389
00:24:08,575 --> 00:24:09,975
恕我冒昧
Forgive me,

390
00:24:09,977 --> 00:24:13,412
但如果大家看到是您在主持这项工作
but wouldn't it benefit your authority

391
00:24:13,414 --> 00:24:17,516
不是更有利于您的权威吗?
to be seen as the hand at work?

392
00:24:21,754 --> 00:24:25,024
我们要从掌管神殿的家族
We need to claim back the true message of our faith

393
00:24:25,026 --> 00:24:27,528
和他们所听命的罗马大人那里
from the families of the temple 

394
00:24:27,626 --> 00:24:30,028
还原我们信仰之道的本来面目
and their masters from Rome.

395
00:24:35,168 --> 00:24:37,736
他们钉死的那个人曾对你们说
They crucified the man who said to you,

396
00:24:37,738 --> 00:24:40,973
"我是世上的光
"I am the light of the world.

397
00:24:40,975 --> 00:24:45,611
跟从我的 就不在黑暗里走"
Whoever follows me won't walk in darkness."

398
00:24:45,613 --> 00:24:48,313
我亲眼看到了他
And with my own eyes, I saw him.

399
00:24:48,315 --> 00:24:52,918
我们刚刚埋葬了一个人... 他是一个好人 一个朋友
We just buried a man... a good man and a friend.

400
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:57,389
就因为他勇敢说出了真理而被乱石砸死
Stoned to death because he dared speak the truth.

401
00:24:57,391 --> 00:25:00,125
他是一个年轻人 就像你们一样
He was a young man, like you.

402
00:25:00,127 --> 00:25:04,263
他会流血 会痛苦 就像你们一样
He shed blood and felt pain, just like you.

403
00:25:04,265 --> 00:25:08,200
他的母亲为他哭泣 就像你们的妈妈一样
His mother wept tears for him, just as yours would.

404
00:25:08,202 --> 00:25:09,835
但是他迫切地想要
But he had a burning need

405
00:25:09,837 --> 00:25:12,070
说出神口中的真理
to speak the truth of the word of God.

406
00:25:12,072 --> 00:25:14,873
代表大祭司该亚法
With the authority of high priest Caiaphas,

407
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:17,776
我 大数人扫罗
I, Saul of Tarsus,

408
00:25:17,778 --> 00:25:21,847
指控这里所有人拥护亵渎神灵者!
hereby accuse all the people here of supporting blasphemy!

409
00:25:21,849 --> 00:25:23,315
你们看到了吗?
Do you see this?

410
00:25:23,317 --> 00:25:25,784
这些罗马的朋友站在我们的对立面上
These friends of Rome standing against us.

411
00:25:25,786 --> 00:25:28,320
这就是你的答案吗? 暴力?
Is this your answer? Violence?

412
00:25:28,322 --> 00:25:30,022
你低估我了
You underestimate me.

413
00:25:30,024 --> 00:25:32,691
你们都会被带走
You will all be taken away

414
00:25:32,693 --> 00:25:35,961
你们的名字会被写在罪犯名单里!
and your name added to a list of offenders!

415
00:25:35,963 --> 00:25:37,296
这些人什么都没有做
These people have done nothing.

416
00:25:37,298 --> 00:25:39,097
如有再犯
Any further offense,

417
00:25:39,099 --> 00:25:42,467
你们都将面临犹太公会的审判!
and you will all face the Sanhedrin court!

418
00:25:42,469 --> 00:25:44,369
那带走我们吧 写我们的名字
Then take us. Take our names.

419
00:25:44,371 --> 00:25:45,771
你们要逮捕的人是我们
We're the ones to arrest.

420
00:25:45,773 --> 00:25:49,141
不 你们两个人可以走了
No. You two can go.

421
00:25:49,143 --> 00:25:53,512
这些人很快就会认识到你们的危险性
These people will soon learn the danger of your company.

422
00:25:53,514 --> 00:25:56,048
你和你的人根本比不过
You and your men are no match

423
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:59,751
我们心中填满的圣灵之火
for the fire of the Holy Spirit that fills us.

424
00:25:59,753 --> 00:26:03,222
真的吗?
Really?

425
00:26:03,224 --> 00:26:08,527
好吧 那就让我们瞧瞧谁的火更旺 怎么样?
Well, let's see whose fire burns brightest, shall we?

426
00:26:10,497 --> 00:26:11,730
全部带走!
Take them!

427
00:26:31,017 --> 00:26:35,020
我已经把那群狂热分子孤立起来了
I've weakened these fanatics by isolating them,

428
00:26:35,022 --> 00:26:38,590
让他们的追随者与他们反目
by turning their supporters against them.

429
00:26:38,592 --> 00:26:41,293
还让耶路撒冷的民众人心惶惶
By terrorizing the citizens of Jerusalem.

430
00:26:41,295 --> 00:26:44,663
呃 这个问题好像没有人能解决
Well, there was a problem nobody seemed able to solve.

431
00:26:44,665 --> 00:26:46,498
你也没有
Neither have you.

432
00:26:53,807 --> 00:26:56,607
他们知道如果在耶路撒冷听人布道
They know you'll persecute them

433
00:26:56,609 --> 00:26:58,076
会受到你的迫害
if they listen to the preachers in Jerusalem,

434
00:26:58,078 --> 00:27:00,913
所以他们选择离开
so they're leaving the city

435
00:27:00,915 --> 00:27:03,582
去听他们要说的话
to hear what they have to say.

436
00:27:12,158 --> 00:27:14,226
你真的觉得这个扫罗
Did you really think this man Saul

437
00:27:14,228 --> 00:27:16,595
会妨碍我们的使命吗?
would stand in the way of our mission?

438
00:27:19,666 --> 00:27:22,501
神殿不会容忍这件事的
The temple won't stand for this.

439
00:27:22,503 --> 00:27:25,671
他们不会让这持续太久的
They won't let it go on much longer.

440
00:27:27,574 --> 00:27:30,108
看上去你这个叫扫罗的英雄
It looks like your hero Saul

441
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:32,911
解决不了拿撒勒人营地的问题
couldn't solve the problem of the Nazarene camp.

442
00:27:32,913 --> 00:27:35,180
你那两个同谋呢?
Where are the other two conspirators?

443
00:27:35,182 --> 00:27:37,416
我不是来和你抬杠的
I didn't come to bicker.

444
00:27:37,418 --> 00:27:40,686
我是来请你表现出一点尊严
I came to ask you to show some dignity,

445
00:27:40,688 --> 00:27:43,155
认清楚犹太公会
to recognize that the will of the Sanhedrin

446
00:27:43,157 --> 00:27:44,623
已经开始反对你了
is turning against you,

447
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:48,627
请你 为了这个家族的利益
and ask you, for the good of this family,

448
00:27:48,629 --> 00:27:50,462
退位吧
to stand down.

449
00:27:50,464 --> 00:27:53,966
为了这个家族的利益?
For the good of this family?

450
00:27:53,968 --> 00:27:55,934
为了这个家族的利益
For the good of this family,

451
00:27:55,936 --> 00:27:58,170
你 当初当大祭司的时候
you, who in his day as high priest

452
00:27:58,172 --> 00:28:00,806
没有和罗马统一步调的智慧
hadn't the wits to walk in step with Rome.

453
00:28:00,808 --> 00:28:03,442
你 留下来一个烂摊子让我收拾
You, who left a mess behind him that I had to clear up,

454
00:28:03,444 --> 00:28:06,378
你 竟敢密谋反对我?
you plot against me?

455
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:09,948
我现在还得听一个失败的糟老头子
And now I must listen to the rantings

456
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:12,151
对着我夸夸其谈
of a failed and a bitter old man

457
00:28:12,153 --> 00:28:14,152
讲什么为了家族的利益?
for the good of this family?

458
00:28:14,154 --> 00:28:15,521
滚出我的房子!
Get out of my house!

459
00:28:15,523 --> 00:28:18,190
要不然我就会忘了你是我妻子的父亲
Before I forget you're my wife's father

460
00:28:18,192 --> 00:28:20,559
然后一刀捅进你的肋骨
and put a blade between your ribs.

461
00:28:20,561 --> 00:28:23,529
我们会上报给彼拉多的
We'll take this to Pilate.

462
00:28:47,432 --> 00:28:50,234
比起该亚法的连襟 你一定更喜欢该亚法
You must favor Caiaphas over his brother-in-law.

463
00:28:50,236 --> 00:28:51,902
一定吗?
Must I?

464
00:28:51,904 --> 00:28:54,405
不要对我指手画脚
Don't tell me what to do.

465
00:28:54,407 --> 00:28:57,041
十年的联盟
A 10-year-old alliance

466
00:28:57,043 --> 00:29:00,111
可不能随便弃之如敝屣
shouldn't be tossed aside without good cause.

467
00:29:02,547 --> 00:29:06,284
你究竟是支持该亚法 还是他夫人?
Is it Caiaphas you approve of or his wife?

468
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:09,487
我听说你们两个变得
I hear the two of you are becoming

469
00:29:09,489 --> 00:29:11,689
可亲近了
the best of friends.

470
00:29:36,214 --> 00:29:40,084
密涅瓦 智慧女神
Minerva, goddess of wisdom.

471
00:29:44,489 --> 00:29:46,624
密涅瓦
Minerva,

472
00:29:46,626 --> 00:29:51,829
这两人究竟谁该做大祭司一职
which of these men shall be high priest,

473
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:55,099
又是谁该被弃之沙漠任其腐朽呢?
and which one shall be left to rot in the desert?

474
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:06,777
什么都没有
Nothing.

475
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:10,047
真叫人失望
Very disappointing.

476
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:14,986
有传言说
There is a rumor

477
00:30:14,988 --> 00:30:17,755
你早知道有人要刺杀我 却毫无作为
you knew of the plot against my life and did nothing.

478
00:30:17,757 --> 00:30:18,789
是真的吗?
Is that true?

479
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:20,224
不 荒谬之极
No. That's ridiculous.

480
00:30:20,226 --> 00:30:24,628
还有传言你在我宫殿里安插了眼线
And a rumor you have a spy here in my palace.

481
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:28,966
还有传言说你每晚都去拜访拿撒勒人的营地
And another that you visit the Nazarene's camp each night

482
00:30:28,968 --> 00:30:30,367
同他们一起祈祷
and pray with them.

483
00:30:30,369 --> 00:30:32,837
如上所述这些都表明
All of which, it's been suggested,

484
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:35,940
你不再适合继续担任公职
makes you unfit to continue in office.

485
00:30:35,942 --> 00:30:37,708
这些传言有一样是真的吗?
Is any of this true?

486
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,410
全都不是
None of it.

487
00:30:39,412 --> 00:30:41,712
都是那些想毁我清誉的人传出去的谣言
Lies are being spread by those who wish to undermine me.

488
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,447
毁你名声的是你自己 你没能控制住...
You undermine yourself by failing to get a grip on...

489
00:30:43,449 --> 00:30:45,116
够了
Enough.

490
00:30:46,551 --> 00:30:53,624
我可没时间浪费在分辨对错上
I will not waste my time separating truth from fiction,

491
00:30:53,626 --> 00:30:57,161
又不是当妈的给争吵的小孩评理
like a mother with squabbling children.

492
00:30:57,163 --> 00:31:01,832
该让提庇留(罗马皇帝)来决定
Tiberius shall decide.

493
00:31:05,237 --> 00:31:08,806
有一次我遇到过一个希腊人 他决定一切事情
I met a Greek once who made every decision

494
00:31:08,808 --> 00:31:11,575
都靠抛掷硬币
with the toss of a coin.

495
00:31:11,577 --> 00:31:13,644
帝王的头像...
Emperor's head...

496
00:31:13,646 --> 00:31:17,615
还是神圣的莉薇娅(提庇留的母亲)?
or the divine Livia?

497
00:31:17,617 --> 00:31:20,651
我是该表彰你的雄心呢?
Shall I commend you for your ambition?

498
00:31:20,653 --> 00:31:26,157
还是该谴责你散播无凭无据的谣言?
Or do I condemn you for spreading baseless rumors?

499
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,559
头像 我谴责你
Heads, I condemn.

500
00:31:28,561 --> 00:31:32,430
莉薇娅 我表彰你
Livia, I commend.

501
00:31:46,812 --> 00:31:50,114
是头像
Heads.

502
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:52,316
那么我谴责你
Then I condemn you

503
00:31:52,318 --> 00:31:55,987
错漏百出的背叛行径
for making such a poor job of your treachery.

504
00:32:01,093 --> 00:32:03,894
那些渔夫和他们的追随者...
These fishermen and their followers...

505
00:32:03,896 --> 00:32:05,796
处理好了吗?
Are they being dealt with?

506
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:08,199
已经果断处理 永无后患了
They are, firmly and finally.

507
00:32:10,469 --> 00:32:14,939
除非是妄想受所有人拥戴
Unless he wants to be loved by all,

508
00:32:14,941 --> 00:32:18,075
否则大祭司一职并不难做
the high priest's job is not a hard one.

509
00:32:18,077 --> 00:32:21,479
他必须要实现
He must deliver what's expected

510
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,681
罗马帝国对犹太省的期望
of the province of Judea by Rome

511
00:32:23,683 --> 00:32:25,750
并且抵御住他的人民
and resist the many, often irrational,

512
00:32:25,752 --> 00:32:27,318
无理的需索
demands of his people.

513
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,688
厨房里的女佣就能做到
There are girls in the kitchen who can do that.

514
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,890
街上的狗也能做到
Dogs in the street.

515
00:32:32,892 --> 00:32:35,726
甚至一头驴也行
Even a donkey.

516
00:32:40,966 --> 00:32:45,536
头像 你就留下
Heads, you stay.

517
00:32:45,538 --> 00:32:48,172
莉薇娅...
Livia...

518
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:53,110
我就找头驴代替你
I'll replace you with a donkey.

519
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:58,382
捡起来好吗 该亚法?
Get that, will you, Caiaphas?

520
00:33:12,297 --> 00:33:13,898
头像
Head.

521
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,766
好极了
Excellent.

522
00:33:15,768 --> 00:33:17,868
你们俩可以退下了
You both may go.

523
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,604
我要同你们的大祭司说话
I need to speak with your high priest.

524
00:33:23,175 --> 00:33:26,177
教你们一课
And the lesson is,

525
00:33:26,179 --> 00:33:29,513
要是没手腕 就别搞政治游戏
don't play politics unless you're good at it.

526
00:33:34,653 --> 00:33:36,387
这枚硬币...
This coin...

527
00:33:40,459 --> 00:33:42,560
两面都是头像
It has two heads.

528
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:45,029
没错 不是吗?
It does, doesn't it?

529
00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:01,912
奉仍居大祭司一职的该亚法之命
By order of Caiaphas, who remains high priest,

530
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:04,348
你从犹太公会中除名了
you are removed from the Sanhedrin.

531
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:08,452
即使是你的亲生父亲和亲兄弟
Even though it was your own father and brother

532
00:34:08,454 --> 00:34:09,787
搞出这场变故吗?
who hatched this plot?

533
00:34:09,789 --> 00:34:11,622
你必须离开耶路撒冷
And you will leave Jerusalem

534
00:34:11,624 --> 00:34:13,925
否则就以叛国罪逮捕你
or find yourself arrested for treason.

535
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:16,594
这一切的起因正是
This all began

536
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:19,697
因为杀了那个拿撒勒人... 耶稣
with the murder of the Nazarene... Jesus.

537
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:22,366
你从旁干扰 玩弄诡计
All your interfering, your scheming.

538
00:34:22,368 --> 00:34:26,237
会让你垮台的... 最终一定会
It will bring you down... eventually.

539
00:34:39,686 --> 00:34:42,053
我试过跟他们讲道理
I tried to reason with them,

540
00:34:42,055 --> 00:34:44,255
但他们就是不肯听
but they just wouldn't listen.

541
00:34:44,257 --> 00:34:49,260
我试着把他们和追随者隔离开
I tried to come between them and their supporters,

542
00:34:49,262 --> 00:34:52,163
最终却发现他们更愿意听从
but it would appear they would prefer

543
00:34:52,165 --> 00:34:56,233
那个拿撒勒人愚蠢的教义
the idiotic doctrine of the Nazarene.

544
00:34:56,235 --> 00:35:00,438
这封信让你全权处理除掉他们的事
This gives you my full authority to rid me of them.

545
00:35:02,541 --> 00:35:04,208
永久有效
Permanently.

546
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:09,080
用尽一切办法
Do whatever is necessary.

547
00:35:17,256 --> 00:35:21,659
不择手段
Whatever is necessary.

548
00:35:55,018 --> 00:35:59,087
让我来告诉你们 那些人
Let me tell you about these people.

549
00:36:01,557 --> 00:36:07,261
那些人想要拆毁神殿...
These people want to bring down the temple...

550
00:36:07,263 --> 00:36:08,997
神殿啊
The temple.

551
00:36:11,634 --> 00:36:15,837
那可是你我生命的指引
The guiding hand in yours and my life.

552
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:19,507
是智慧的源泉
The well of wisdom.

553
00:36:19,509 --> 00:36:22,810
而他们以为没人...
And they think nobody...

554
00:36:22,812 --> 00:36:25,580
没人... 能阻止他们
Nobody... will stand in their way.

555
00:36:25,582 --> 00:36:28,750
犹太公会裁决他们亵渎神灵
They disregard the ruling of the Sanhedrin,

556
00:36:28,752 --> 00:36:31,719
他们却漠然视之!
who call them blasphemers!

557
00:36:31,721 --> 00:36:33,121
就在第二天
The very next day,

558
00:36:33,123 --> 00:36:35,957
他们其中一人居然大摇大摆走入神殿
one of them walked into the temple itself

559
00:36:35,959 --> 00:36:37,759
满口亵渎神明
proclaiming his profanity.

560
00:36:39,763 --> 00:36:41,062
而且即使...
And although...

561
00:36:41,064 --> 00:36:43,798
即使耶路撒冷的人民
And although the people of Jerusalem

562
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,635
主持了公义 将他乱石砸死
delivered their justice and they stoned him to death,

563
00:36:47,637 --> 00:36:53,074
他们还是继续招募那些心智软弱的愚民
they continue recruiting the gullible and the weak-minded

564
00:36:53,076 --> 00:36:55,777
参与他们的事业
to their cause.

565
00:36:55,779 --> 00:37:01,316
是不是够了?
Do we say enough?

566
00:37:01,318 --> 00:37:02,517
够了!
Enough!

567
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:05,820
我们要不要砍掉他们的头?
Will we break their heads?

568
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,556
用刀剑
With swords

569
00:37:08,558 --> 00:37:11,893
用棍棒 用自己的拳头
and clubs and bare fists,

570
00:37:11,895 --> 00:37:15,096
我们要告诉他们"滚出这片土地
we will say, "leave this land,

571
00:37:15,098 --> 00:37:20,602
否则就让你们的血染红大地!"
or you will leave this earth in a shroud of blood!"

572
00:37:31,347 --> 00:37:34,582
拿起武器! 拿起护具!
Grab weapons! Grab armor!

573
00:37:34,584 --> 00:37:36,184
跟我来!
Follow me!

574
00:37:52,368 --> 00:37:56,404
大家听好了 都传出话去
Pay heed to this and spread the word.

575
00:37:56,406 --> 00:38:00,341
这些人被逮捕 是因为帮助 庇护
These people are being arrested for aiding, sheltering,

576
00:38:00,343 --> 00:38:03,545
和喂养那个假冒弥赛亚的信众
and feeding the followers of the false Messiah.

577
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:05,480
他们会被...
They will be...

578
00:38:06,882 --> 00:38:08,650
会被关押起来
They will be imprisoned.

579
00:38:08,652 --> 00:38:10,951
任何人有相同行径
Anyone else who does likewise

580
00:38:10,953 --> 00:38:13,655
同样将付出自由的代价
will also pay with their freedom.

581
00:38:13,657 --> 00:38:16,658
还有 别想着跑去沙漠里
And don't think of scurrying off to the desert

582
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,626
向你们的朋友求救
for help from your friends.

583
00:38:18,628 --> 00:38:21,929
下一个就轮到他们
It's their turn next.

584
00:38:35,644 --> 00:38:37,178
他来了!
He's coming!

585
00:38:38,647 --> 00:38:40,815
扫罗回来了!
Saul's coming back!

586
00:38:40,817 --> 00:38:42,216
他的随从手里有武器
He's bringing men with swords.

587
00:38:49,658 --> 00:38:51,993
尽量拿上行李!
Take what you can!

588
00:38:51,995 --> 00:38:54,062
让大家赶快离开这里
Let's get everyone out of here.

589
00:38:58,233 --> 00:39:00,134
这边 走 跟他们一块走
This way. Go. Go with them.

590
00:39:04,507 --> 00:39:05,974
我们应该回加利利去
We should go back to Galilee.

591
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:07,475
不 我们必须一起留下来
No, we have to stay together.

592
00:39:07,477 --> 00:39:08,910
我们在耶路撒冷碰头
We gather again in Jerusalem.

593
00:39:08,912 --> 00:39:10,078
我们必须现在就走
We have to go now.

594
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,480
不 我要留下来
No. I'll stay.

595
00:39:14,016 --> 00:39:16,651
我才不会被这个男人和他的威胁所吓倒
I will not be cowed by this man and his threats.

596
00:39:16,653 --> 00:39:19,554
我不会让你一个人去面对
I won't leave you to face him alone.

597
00:39:19,556 --> 00:39:20,922
他不是一个人
He won't be alone.

598
00:39:20,924 --> 00:39:23,891
这是我的土地 我要留下来
This was my land. I'm staying.

599
00:39:24,293 --> 00:39:25,525
还有我
And me.

600
00:39:25,527 --> 00:39:28,196
待客之道可不止一种
There's more than one way to welcome a visitor.

601
00:39:28,198 --> 00:39:31,933
我们耶路撒冷见
See you in Jerusalem.

602
00:39:34,069 --> 00:39:37,372
