年

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,720
你就不能放着别玩了吗
Can you just keep it and not play anymore?
年

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,370
你就不能放着别玩了吗
Can you just keep it and not play anymore?

4
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:05,120
不行
No.

5
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,270
解释下那个
Explain that one.

6
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:09,180
女人总会再给男人一次机会
You always give a guy a second chance.

7
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,310
这算是男人心知肚明的金科玉律
That's, like, the golden rule of guys.

8
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:12,440
这有什么问题
Then what's the problem?

9
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,380
问题在于我不能让他知道
The problem is I can't let him know

10
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,900
我放任你重蹈覆辙
I'm letting you in the back.

11
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,500
乔安娜  你尽可随意取笑
Look, Joanna, you can go ahead d make fun of this,

12
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,400
但这不是闹着玩的
but this is real important.

13
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,520
我是在向你揭示男人的想法
I mean, I'm telling you what guys think,

14
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,890
如果你想像他们一样  就别乱了规矩
and if you want to be one of the guys, you don't break the code.

15
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,740
抓住男人的命根子不就结了
Held in guy's dick.

16
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,870
这可不轻松
It's no picnic.

17
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,770
不  撒迪厄斯  快走开
No, Thaddeus, go away!

18
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,800
告诉我你的名字
Tell me, what's your name?

19
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,780
泰  泰特
T-Tate.

20
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,150
要是撒迪厄斯再回来吓你
If Thaddeus comes back to scare you again,

21
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,120
就闭上眼  大喊"走开"
just shut your eyes and say, "Go away."

22
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,390
明白了吗  泰特
You understand, Tate?

23
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,980
他不会把你怎样的
He'll mind you

24
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,790
因为我会保护你
'cause I'm going to protect you.

25
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,200
真希望你是我妈妈
I wish you were my mommy.

26
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,600
擦干眼泪  孩子
Now dry your tears, child.

27
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,800
人生苦短  切莫悲伤
Life is too short for so much sorrow.

28
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,430
你是谁
Who are you?

29
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,310
是我  泰特呀
It's me, Tate.

30
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,870
"人生苦短  切莫悲伤"
"Life's too short for so much sorrow."

31
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,170
你错了
You're wrong.

32
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,070
我将永世被困于此
It's an eternity.

33
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,440
日以继夜  无限渴望
Just endless days and nights of longing;

34
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,460
我的孩子在哪儿
where's my baby?

35
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,010
我正是想和你谈谈此事
That's what I want to talk to you about.

36
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,940
你答应过我
You, you promised me.

37
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,050
你会与她生一个  与房子的女主人
You made one with her, the-the lady of the house.

38
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,530
维维安
Vivien.

39
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,260
她是瓦奥莱特的母亲
That's Violet's mother.

40
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,190
我没法再给你那个孩子
And I can't give you that baby anymore.

41
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,020
计划有变  诺拉
Everything's changed, Nora.

42
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,550
我爱上了瓦奥莱特
I'm in love with Violet.

43
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,830
我懂了
I see.

44
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,410
我不能夺走她的亲弟弟
I just can't take her brother away.

45
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,610
但我能
But I can.

46
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,570
我会拿到手的
And I will.

47
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,450
那孩子是我的
That baby is mine.

第一季 第十一集
美国恐怖故事

54
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,790
爸爸  我不是条狗
Dad, I'm not a dog!

55
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,560
我说了我不舒服  把我丢在这就好
I told you I don't feel well! Just leave me here!

56
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,500
不  我再也不相信你了  我也不相信泰特
No, I don't trust you anymore and I don't trust Tate!

57
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,070
泰特  我和他好几周没见面了
Tate? I haven't seen him in weeks!

58
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,450
别再撒谎了  瓦奥莱特  你妈妈就要回家了
No more, Violet. Your mom's coming home

59
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,910
你要和我一起去接她
and you're coming with me to get her.

60
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,210
爸爸  求你了  我不舒服
Dad, please, I don't feel well!

61
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,390
你可以在车里躺着
You can lay down in the car.

62
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,690
等会回家了  就收拾东西
And when you get home, pack up your things.

63
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,030
我们要永远离开这房子
We're leaving this house for good.

64
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,780
什么  你俩又和好了吗
What? You guys are back together?

65
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,270
我还不清楚  你妈妈想
I don't know yet-- your mom wants

66
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,520
去你娇姨妈那分娩  我支持她的想法
to go to Aunt Jo's to give birth, and I'm supporting it.

67
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,900
不  这非你所愿
No, you don't want to do this.

68
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,780
瓦奥莱特  你妈妈被关在
Violet, your mother's been locked up

69
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,690
精神病院好几周了
in a psych ward for weeks.

70
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,810
我不会让她在那里再多待一分钟
I won't let her stay there for another minute.

71
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,700
是你自己上去还是我把你拽上车
Are you gonna get in the car or do I have to make you?

72
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,510
天呐  瓦奥莱特  你到底怎么了
My God, Violet, what is wrong with you?!

73
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,230
上车去  你妈妈想见你
Get in the car! Your mother wants to see you!

74
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,560
我会吐出来的
I'm gonna throw up!

75
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,900
好吧  我躺下就是了
Fine. I'll lay down.

76
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,700
他们回来后会发生什么
What's gonna happen when they get back?

77
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,000
我该说什么
What do I say?

78
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,360
不是UTube  是YouTube
It's not UTube with a U. It's YouTube.

79
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,030
Y-O-U
Y-o-u.

80
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,190
他们若是发现我自杀了
If they find out I killed myself,

81
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,510
会疯掉的
they'll go insane.

82
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,010
这次真心会发疯的
Literally, for real this time.

83
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,640
不能让他们知道
They can't know.

84
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,700
你又不能永远瞒下去
Well, you can't control it forever.

85
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,360
事实摆在眼前  瓦奥莱特
I mean, it is what it is, Violet.

86
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,930
有朝一日  这种电脑会被淘汰
One of these days, this computer will be obsolete.

87
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,930
人们的脑部或是什么地方
People will have microchips implanted

88
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,470
会植入微芯片
in their brains or something.

89
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,540
我们也就没法上YouTube看视频之类的了
We won't be able to watch YouTube or anything.

90
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,880
我们会和其他鬼魂一样
We'll be like all the others here;

91
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,370
困在这个无形的牢房里
prisoners in a windowless cell.

92
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,250
谁能向我展示大千世界的新奇万物
Who's gonna show me the new ways of the world?

93
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,370
这里的鬼魂都不快乐  泰特
Nobody here is happy, Tate.

94
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,380
是的  但咱俩和他们不同
Well, yeah, but they're not like us.

95
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:02,570
他们孤独寂寞
They're lonely.

96
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,960
我们拥有彼此
We have each other.

97
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,220
我们没法生儿育女
We'll never have kids.

98
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,090
麦德姆没有土豆卖
I was so worried when Madame

99
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,550
我本来还很担心
didn't have any potatoes,

100
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,610
但我得说  红薯刻印的效果更清晰
but I have to say these yams making a cleaner image.

101
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,510
我想是水分更少的缘故
Less moisture, I think.

102
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,340
中国红真好看
I love that Chinese red.

103
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,930
我总想把楼下的盥洗室刷成这颜色
I always meant to use it in the powder room downstairs.

104
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,820
我准备把这旧的婴儿床也刷成这颜色
I'm gonna paint those old cribs, too.

105
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:39,100
真的吗  大红色的婴儿床
Really? Red cribs?

106
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,440
查德...
Uh, Chad...

107
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,950
我们之前是怎么说的
what did we talk about?

108
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:48,390
是"咱俩"的孩子  不是"我"的孩子
"Our" babies, not "My" babies.

109
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,970
随你啦  红艳艳的婴儿床又不会死
You know what? I can live with a red crib.

110
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,270
效果或许会超赞呢
It might actually be kind of fabulous.

111
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,960
你开心的样子真迷人
You are so adorable when you're happy.

112
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,390
谁请你们来装饰育婴室了
Who asked you to decorate the nursery?

113
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:07,020
就让我给你解释下吧  小甜心
Let me break it down for you, sweetheart.

114
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,250
这房子是我俩的
This is our house

115
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,060
我们会有一对双胞胎
and we're having twins.

116
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,940
谁是代孕妈妈  地下室挨着我的护士之一吗
Who's your surrogate, one of those nurses in my basement?

117
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,440
不...  不是的
No... no.

118
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:21,090
一个极富人性的代孕母亲  艾维拉
A very, very human surrogate, Elvira.

119
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,610
你可爱的母亲
Your lovely mother.

120
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,270
你以为你们能拐走那对双胞胎吗
You think you're gonna steal those twins?

121
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,540
你俩可悲的基佬
You pathetic homos couldn't steal

122
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,160
连自己屁眼里的屎都拐不走
the shit out of your own ass!

123
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,040
知道吗
You know what?

124
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,450
无所谓
It doesn't matter.

125
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,110
一旦我父母回来  我们就离开这里
As soon as my parents get back, we're leaving here.

126
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,820
至少他们会离开
They're leaving.

127
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,950
少痴心妄想了
So knock yourselves out.

128
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:44,740
亲爱的  只要你被困在这儿
Honey, your parents aren't going anywhere

129
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,980
你父母哪儿都去不了
as long as you're stuck here.

130
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,510
到时候别一把鼻涕一把泪哦  小妹妹
And don't you get all snotty, little sister.

131
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,110
你会求着帮我们带孩子的
You'll be begging to babysit.

132
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,630
这房子真大  确实会越来越寂寞
As big as this place is, it does get very, very lonely.

133
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,620
狠手不是不能下
It could get ugly, though.

134
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,550
你是剖腹产生下来的吧
Were you a C-section?

135
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,170
或许她肚子上有现成的伤口吧
Is there an existing zipper we might use?

136
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,980
注意点  你个该死的便装皇后
Watch it, you goddamn queen.

137
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,140
人家好怕怕哟
Oh, I am quaking in my loafers.

138
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,480
你打算怎办
What are you gonna do...

139
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,980
杀了我吗
murder me?

140
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,070
我的褐色贝蒂布丁20分钟后就变成黑贝蒂布丁了
My brown Betty turns to black Betty in 20 minutes.

141
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:27,740
所以有话快讲
So tell me what this is all about.

142
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,540
我需要帮助
I need help.

143
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,820
你知道在我们之前住这的那俩人吗
Do you know those two guys that lived here before us?

144
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,260
那对娘炮吗
Frick and Frack?

145
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,610
那俩怎会叫人忘记
How could I forget?

146
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:36,690
他们在楼上  而且
Well, they're upstairs and they're

147
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,090
他们打算绑架我妈妈的双胞胎
planning to kidnap my mother's babies

148
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,830
自己来抚养
and raise them themselves.

149
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,730
我向你保证  那是不可能发生的
Well, let me assure you that is never going to happen.

150
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:49,130
我妈妈今天就从医院回来
My mom's on her way back from the hospital today.

151
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,190
我不相信他们
And I don't trust them.

152
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,830
找你来是因为我想和那个女人谈谈
I called 'cause I want to talk to that woman,

153
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,880
克雷格列表上找的那个疯神婆
the Craig's List psychic.

154
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,070
比莉·迪恩么  要谈什么
Billie Dean? About what?

155
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:00,080
肯定会有办法摆脱这些鬼魂
Getting rid of ghosts. There must be a way.

156
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,960
别担心  我会解决的
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

157
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,830
查德  查德
Chad? Chad...?

158
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,690
不管你在哪  快点出来吧
Come out, come out wherever you are.

159
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,400
把你肮脏的爪子从床边拿开
Put your skanky claw on that crib,

160
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,540
不然我就让它沾满鲜血
you'll be pulling away a bloody stump.

161
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,920
你从哪儿找到这些东西的
Where did you find these things?

162
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,090
四处翻来的
Around.

163
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,290
前任房主们都留下的珍奇的宝藏
You'd be amazed at the little forgotten treasures left behind

164
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,020
会让你惊奇的
by previous occupants.

165
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:41,310
你所计划的事情是违反自然的
What you are planning to do is unnatural.

166
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:45,450
除臭剂也是违反自然的  还不是卖得很好
Deodorant's unnatural, but it's a public good.

167
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,270
我们会是很棒的父母
We'll make excellent parents.

168
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:50,060
男人不应该和男人在一起
Man shall not lie with man.

169
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,620
这有违天理
It is an abomination.

170
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:55,390
你的发型也是  不过那是你的问题了
So's that hairdo, but I figure that's your business.

171
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:59,110
你们为什么就不能安分一点  养个宠物
Why can't you people just content yourself with having pets?

172
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,920
为什么非要将你们扭曲的生活
Why must you subject an innocent child

173
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,460
强加到一个无辜的孩子身上
to your perversions?

174
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,030
没有任何研究显示在同性家庭中成长
There's nothing in the studies that indicates being raised

175
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:09,020
会对孩子造成负面影响
by a same-sex couple has any ill effects on children.

176
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,410
我想对死后的家庭也同样适用
I assume the same applies to the formerly living.

177
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:14,430
我唯一知道的研究  是血与泪的教训
Well, the only study I know is the study of blood and pain.

178
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,010
我的孩子是我身上掉下的肉
My children came out of my body,

179
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:19,970
这点是你永远无法理解的
and that is something that you will never be able to understand.

180
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:25,710
女士  他们只是从你的肚子里爬出来罢了
Lady, just because you happen to be the hole they crawled out of

181
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,310
根本毫无意义
doesn't mean a goddamn thing.

182
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,570
这意义非凡
It means everything.

183
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,700
好吧  当然了
Right. Sure.

184
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,420
这就是为什么每次我在自己房子里溜达时
That's why I can't even walk through my own home

185
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,330
总能撞见几个你那些死掉的子女
without tripping over one of your dead offspring.

186
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,910
我深爱我的孩子
I loved my children.

187
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,140
爱到死
To death.

188
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,020
他们都是我的一部分
They are a part of me,

189
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,280
那个未降生的孩子也是一样
just like that unborn child is a part of me,

190
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:48,430
我绝不会让你的脏手碰到我孙子一下
and I will not have you put your filthy hands on my grandchild.

191
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,220
孙子
Grandchild?

192
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,920
等一下
Wait a minute.

193
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,820
你不会是说那位小诺曼·贝茨
Are you telling me that Norman Bates Jr.

194
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,580
就要当爸爸了吧
is the baby daddy?

195
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,080
你一定会爱上这栋房子
You gotta love this house.

196
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,340
听我说
Listen to me.

197
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,790
你可以抱走另外一个
You can have the other one.

198
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,480
哈蒙医生的那个骨肉
The one fathered by Dr. Harmon.

199
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,660
他可是个迷人的男人
I mean, he's an attractive man.

200
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,640
但你不能抢走我孙子
But not my grandbaby.

201
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,360
一个金发一个黑发  就像我和帕特一样
A blond and a brunette-- just like me and Pat.

202
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,760
太完美了
It's perfect.

203
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,980
不
No.

204
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,140
我们两个都要定了
We definitely need both.

205
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,700
你这个贱人
God, you're vile.

206
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,040
你根本不懂得抚养孩子
You're not suited to raise children.

207
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,400
抚养他们
Raise them?

208
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:33,080
亲爱的  不 不
Oh, honey, no, no, no.

209
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,800
我们会等他们长到完美可爱的年龄
We're going to wait until they reach that perfect, adorable age--

210
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,520
大概一岁或一岁半左右
around a year, year and a half or so--

211
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,390
再用低致敏性的枕头把他们闷死
and then we're going to smother them with hypoallergenic pillows.

212
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,940
这样他们就会永远可爱下去了
That way, they'll be cute forever.

213
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,680
这里有太多的痛苦
So much pain here.

214
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:12,120
太多的留恋和遗憾
So much longing and regret.

215
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,950
恐惧
Fear.

216
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,830
悲伤
Sadness.

217
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,500
罪孽
Guilt.

218
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,180
还有扭曲
And perversion.

219
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:28,430
你现在可以帮我们找到那些鬼魂吗
Now, can you ferret out the fairies for us?

220
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:31,890
这是我们眼下最大的困扰
I mean, that's our main concern at the moment.

221
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:35,670
追踪某一个灵魂是非常难的
Targeting a particular spirit is going to be difficult.

222
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,710
这房子都快满员了
This is a very crowded house.

223
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,410
你还这么年轻
You were so young.

224
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,440
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

225
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,920
天呐
Oh, God.

226
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,120
求你千万别说出去
Please don't tell.

227
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,400
不能让爸妈知道
They can't know.

228
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,960
我们该怎么做
So what can we do?

229
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,090
我们要想办法把他们与
Somehow, we have to try and dislodge them

230
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:54,690
这里的磁性吸引力分离
from the paramagnetic grip of this place.

231
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,470
什么东西
The what?

232
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,100
恶魔之力
The evil.

233
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:02,050
和其他力量没有区别  瓦奥莱特
It's a force just like any other, Violet.

234
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,100
就是单纯的物理学
Pure physics.

235
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,650
真实而强大
Real and powerful.

236
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,110
因各类事件产生
Created by events.

237
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,420
那些将灵魂的能量释放至
Events that unleash psychic energy

238
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,850
能够吸收灵力的环境中的事件
into the environment, where it's absorbed.

239
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,340
就像电池充电一样
Like the way a battery stores energy.

240
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,960
它随处可见
You'll see it all the time

241
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,890
在监狱或避难所之类的地方
in places like prisons or asylums.

242
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:27,450
负面的能量靠创伤和痛苦滋生
Negative energy feeds on trauma and pain.

243
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,670
将伤痛汇聚丛生
It draws those things to it.

244
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,410
这座房子里的力
The force here in this house

245
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:37,260
比许多人的伤痛加在一起还要巨大
is larger than the many individual traumas.

246
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,760
而且它有强大的欲望
And it has a need.

247
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,740
它想要挣脱束缚
It wants to break through.

248
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,440
它想要闯入我们的世界
It wants to move in our world.

249
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,960
它把那些被困在阴阳两界的灵魂当做通道
It's using those trapped between this world and the next as conduits.

250
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,330
很有趣
That's very interesting.

251
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,880
可是我们该拿那对同性恋怎么办
But what do we do about the gays?

252
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,360
怎么除掉他们
I mean, how do we get rid of them?

253
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,960
可能会有办法
Oh, there might be a way.

254
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,520
我不能保证
I can't promise...

255
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,640
他不可以在场
He can't be here.

256
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,830
泰特
Tate.

257
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,280
比莉·迪恩
Billie Dean,

258
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,750
那是我儿子
that's my boy.

259
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,780
他就是泰特
That's Tate.

260
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:15,650
我想帮忙
I want to help.

261
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,400
你已经帮得够多了
You've helped enough.

262
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,530
现在不行  泰特
Not now, Tate.

263
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:20,690
继续吧
Go on.

264
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,100
刚才是怎么回事
What was that about?

265
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:35,750
只是有时  当灵媒如此直接的面对鬼魂
It's just that, sometimes, when a medium meets a spirit so directly,

266
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,180
会有很强烈的反应
it has a powerful effect.

267
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:37,990
仅此而已
That's all.

268
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:40,480
你没什么可担心的
It's nothing to concern yourself about.

269
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,350
好了  那我们可以做些什么
Okay, so what can we do?

270
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,880
瓦奥莱特怎么没来
Why didn't Violet come?

271
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:50,410
瓦奥莱特最近状态不好
Violet's been having a very rough time.

272
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,690
她一次都没来看过我  本
She didn't come visit me once, Ben.

273
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:57,310
我是迈凯西医生  这里的住院医师
I'm Dr. Marchesi, the resident physician.

274
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,770
你还好吗  维维安
How are you, Vivien?

275
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,910
我很好  准备好回家了
Fine. Ready to go home.

276
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,470
你有没有说服你妻子
Have you had any luck convincing your wife

277
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:05,060
将旅行推迟到生产后
to push off the trip until after the birth?

278
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,160
迈凯西医生建议我卧床休息
Dr. Marchesi is recommending bed rest

279
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,100
因为双胞胎的缘故
because of the twins,

280
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,110
我完全赞同
which I wholeheartedly agree with.

281
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,920
我告诉他我们可以在机场找一个轮椅
And I said to him that we would get a wheelchair at the airport.

282
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,350
我会一直坐着到佛罗里达
I will be sitting the whole way to Florida.

283
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,990
我现在才怀孕六个月
And I'm only six months pregnant,

284
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,840
旅行没什么问题  我不会有事
so it's still okay to travel. I'll be fine.

285
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,240
好吧  坐轮椅是可以
All right, well, wheelchairs are all well and good,

286
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,840
但就像我告诉你妻子的
but as I told your wife,

287
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,180
我估计你的妇产医生并没有
I wouldn't be surprised if your obstetrician

288
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,960
建议你要采取紧急剖腹产吧
didn't recommend an immediate emergency C-section.

289
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,900
再有24个小时
Well, in 24 hours,

290
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,760
我就会在我妹妹和她家人的照顾之中
I will be in the capable hands of my sister and her family

291
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,420
还会有一个出色的妇产医生
and an excellent obstetrician.

292
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,910
我会和我所信任的人在一起
I'll be with people who I trust,

293
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,770
离开这座城市
and out of this city.

294
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,250
感谢您把这些东西拿来
Thank you for bringing these.

295
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,400
我会交给医生的
I'll bring them to the doctor.

296
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,570
我想听医生说说你的情况
I'd like to hear it from the doctor.

297
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,550
紧急剖腹产是吗
Emergency C-section?

298
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,960
我想你知道这两个孩子
I'm sure you're aware that these babies--

299
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,070
应该说  其中一个孩子
well, rather, one of these babies--

300
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:53,830
一直长得很快
has been developing at a rapid rate.

301
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,090
直到他
I mean, to the point

302
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:58,200
分离出母体  能靠自己存活
where he's ready to come out and live on his own.

303
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,900
与此同时  另一个孩子却日渐孱弱
And the other one seems to be getting weaker.

304
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,920
有时称其为宫内生食胎
Sometimes referred to as intrauterine omophagia.

305
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,590
所有必须的营养物质
All the necessary nutrients

306
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,460
都被较大的胎儿所吸收
are being devoured by the larger fetus.

307
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,820
可称之为阿尔法胎儿
The alpha, if you will.

308
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,910
你什么时候才要告诉我呢  维维安
When were you going to tell me this, Vivien?

309
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:14,010
等我们到了弗罗里达就一五一十告诉你
We will address it all when we get to Florida.

310
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,730
我还有事情
Well, I'm on record.

311
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,430
很高兴认识你们  哈蒙医生  维维安
It was nice to meet you, Dr. Harmon, Vivien.

312
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,280
如果我是你  我会去看一下
If I were you, I would start checking to see

313
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,960
那次航班上有没有医生
if there's a medical doctor on that flight.

314
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,080
走吧
Let's go.

315
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,380
驱除鬼魂是很困难的
It's difficult to banish a spirit,

316
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,170
不过亦非毫无可能
but not impossible.

317
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:41,200
就我所知  最成功的一次
The most successful attempt that I know of

318
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,780
发生在美国还被称为新大陆的时候
happened when America was known as the New World.

319
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,880
真的假的
Are you kidding?

320
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,090
那可是五百年前的事了
That's like 500 years ago.

321
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,820
灵魂既不遵循我们的自然法则
Spirits do not follow our physical laws.

322
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,890
也不受时间的影响
Nor are they affected by time.

323
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:52,430
他们唯一跟活人一样的
About the only thing they have in common

324
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,750
就是他们所承受的苦难
with the living is their suffering.

325
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,390
悔恨
Regret.

326
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,040
痛苦
Pain.

327
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,090
以及孤寂
Loneliness.

328
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,500
1590年
In 1590,

329
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,660
在如今的北卡罗来纳州沿岸
on the coast of what we now know as North Carolina,

330
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,980
罗诺克殖民地
the entire colony of Roanoke--

331
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:12,150
一共117个男女老少
all 117 men, women and children--

332
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,290
一夜之间死光了
died inexplicably.

333
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,410
后来那里被称为鬼地
It became known as the Ghost Colony

334
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,920
就是因为那些怨灵还在那游荡
because the spirits remained.

335
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:23,060
他们常出没于住在附近的土著部落
They haunted the native tribes living in the surrounding area.

336
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,210
滥杀无辜
Killing indiscriminately.

337
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,520
那位长老知道他必须有所行动
The elder knew he had to act.

338
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,170
于是他施了一个驱逐咒
He cast a banishment curse.

339
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:38,260
首先  他收集了一些
First, he collected the personal belongings

340
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,570
死去殖民的贴身物品
of all the dead colonists.

341
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,290
然后烧了它们
Then they burned them.

342
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:46,520
鬼魂受到护身符的召唤而现形
The ghosts appeared, summoned by their talismans.

343
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,070
但就在那些幽灵造成进一步伤害之前
But before the spirits could cause them any more harm,

344
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:52,250
那位长老完成了诅咒
the elder completed the curse

345
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,860
可以永远驱逐这些鬼魂
that would banish the ghosts forever.

346
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,600
怎么驱逐
How?

347
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,950
就念一个词
By uttering a single word.

348
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,830
他们发现刻在殖民地的
The same word found carved on a post

349
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,800
圆锥桩子上的那个词
at the aband coned colony.

350
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,850
克柔投安
Croatoan.

351
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,890
现在你知道自己该做什么了
So now you know what you have to do.

352
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,450
她都说了些什么
What did she say?

353
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,680
我们得找些他的东西来
We have to get something of his.

354
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:27,630
重要物品
Something important.

355
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,240
比如说传家宝或者婚戒什么的
Like an heirloom or a ring.

356
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,830
就像护身符一样的东西
Like a talisman.

357
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,800
如果我们拿到了他的护身符然后进行驱魔
If we have the talisman and we do this special ritual,

358
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,690
他就会消失了
he'll be gone.

359
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,340
听起来就是胡扯
That sounds like bullshit.

360
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,460
比莉·迪恩不是骗子  她专业驱鬼的
Billie Dean's for real. She studies this stuff.

361
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,700
壮点的那家伙  他带着戒指
The bigger guy, he wears a ring.

362
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,110
跟婚戒差不多  但我记不清
It's like a wedding ring, but I can't remember

363
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,140
-到底戴在哪只手上了  -我不信任她
- which hand it's on. - I don't trust her!

364
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,940
她那么说我是为什么
Now, why'd she say all that stuff about me?

365
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,910
我干坏事了是吗
I did something bad, didn't I?

366
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,200
我们去找戒指吧
Let's just get the ring.

367
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:59,280
怎么能行得通呢
How does it work?

368
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,210
孩子将来是都叫你俩爸爸呢
Will the kid call you both daddy,

369
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,190
还是一个叫妈妈呢
or is one of you the mom?

370
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,170
我只是来捣乱的
I'm just messing with you.

371
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,750
不过说真的
Seriously, though,

372
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,020
你真的准备好这些了吗
are you ready for all this?

373
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,790
你在我印象里可不是什么换尿布
I mean, you never struck me as the diapers

374
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,330
还有半夜喂奶的形象
and midnight feedings type.

375
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,370
或许在你用火钳捅我屁股之前
Maybe you should have taken a few minutes to get to know me

376
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:19,430
该花几分钟了解一下我的
before you stuck a fireplace poker up my ass.

377
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:21,730
有道理
Fair enough.

378
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,810
我们会在这里相处很长一段时间
We're all going to be here for a long time, so...

379
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,980
或许我们该想个办法忘记旧账既往不咎
maybe we can figure out a way to let bygones be bygones

380
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,810
然后和平共处
and, you know, cohabitate.

381
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,100
是你杀了我
I'm dead because of you!

382
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,350
我总有能帮上忙的地方吧
Well, there's got to be something I could offer you.

383
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,520
就因为我们已经死了
I mean, just because we're dead

384
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,290
不代表我们没有需求
doesn't mean we don't have wants.

385
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,550
没有欲望
Desires.

386
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,260
婚姻貌似很艰难
Marriage looks hard.

387
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,070
特别是跟那家伙结婚
Especially to that guy.

388
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,880
总是对你颐指气使
Always on you all the time.

389
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,990
却从不考虑你想要什么  对吗
And never in the ways you want, right?

390
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,910
要等到
It must suck

391
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:02,500
每年的万圣节才能来点不寻常的刺激
to have to wait till Halloween every year

392
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,180
肯定感觉很糟吧
to get a little strange.

393
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:15,560
我杀不了你
I can't kill you,

394
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,040
但我可以让你遭罪
but I can make you suffer!

395
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:19,900
最棒的是  等我揍完了
Best part is, when I'm done,

396
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,340
你很快就会痊愈
you'll heal up and I can beat

397
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,330
而我就又可以把你打得屁滚尿流了
the shit out of you all over again!

398
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,510
再狠一点
Harder!

399
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:28,070
-我就喜欢粗暴  -不该是这样的
- I like it rough. - Not supposed to be like this!

400
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,060
我不该在这里的
I'm not supposed to be here!

401
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,440
看着我  看着我
Look at me. Look at me!

402
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,330
我本来是要离开这里的
I was going to get out!

403
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,430
我恋爱了  上帝保佑
I fell in love. God help me, I was going

404
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,850
我本是要离开这里跟他在一起的
to get out and be with him,

405
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,220
而你却杀了我  让我困在这里
and then you killed me, and now I'm stuck here...

406
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,620
跟他困在一起
with him!

407
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,460
查德
Chad.

408
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,150
我不会进这间屋子的
I won't go in the house.

409
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,420
你不用进去
You don't have to.

410
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,830
我整理了你的行李
I packed your things.

411
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,240
瓦奥莱特整理好了吗
Is Violet packed?

412
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,030
我告诉她我们要离开了
I told her we're leaving.

413
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,680
你还好吗
You ok?

414
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,720
你拿到了什么
Wh'd you get?

415
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,230
他把它脱下来去上漆了
He took it off to paint.

416
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,060
一个鬼魂怎么会需要手表呢
Why does a ghost need a watch?

417
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,220
瓦奥莱特
Violet!

418
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,160
瓦奥莱特
Violet!

419
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:10,000
你在我面前消失了  这是什么情况
You disappeared on me! What the hell happened?!

420
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,360
瓦奥莱特  你妈妈在车里等着
Violet, your mom's waiting in the car.

421
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,880
我们还要赶飞机
We have a plane to catch.

422
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,960
很好  走得越远越好
Good. Go far away.

423
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,770
别再把妈妈带到这间屋子里来
Just don't bring mom in the house.

424
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:21,080
-你说什么呢  你要一起走  -我不
- What are you talking about? You're coming with us. - No!

425
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,140
我能照顾好自己
I can take care of myself.

426
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,530
如果你们想的话  以后可以回来找我
And if you want to, you can come back for me later.

427
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:25,940
但现在  你们必须相信我
But for right now, you just have to trust me

428
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,040
赶快离开这里
and get the hell out of here.

429
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,170
告诉妈妈我爱她  希望她母子平安
Tell mom I love her and good luck with the babies.

430
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:30,840
你怎么回事
What's the matter with you? Huh?

431
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,990
嗑药了还是怎么的
Are you high or something?

432
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,130
我倒想
I wish.

433
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:35,860
瓦奥莱特  我红灯停车的时候你不见了
Violet, I stopped at a red light and you were gone.

434
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,290
-你上哪去了  -没上哪去
- Where did you go? - Nowhere.

435
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,710
我就在这里
I was right here.

436
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,380
我也想去的
I wanted to come.

437
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,330
我发誓
I swear.

438
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:42,670
我无法离开这房子
I couldn't leave the house.

439
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,750
够了  你在说谎
Stop it! You're lying.

440
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,510
你肯定嗑药了  我能看出来
You're on drugs, I can tell.

441
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,630
告诉我  是什么药
Tell me what kind, right now.

442
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:47,790
快说
Tell me!

443
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,670
我已经死了
I'm dead!

444
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,860
你怎么还不明白
Don't you get it?

445
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:56,190
死在这所房子里的人  根本无法离开
When you die in this house, you don't get to leave.

446
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,550
所以你需要赶紧离开
That's why you need to go,

447
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,900
把妈妈送到安全的地方
and take Mom somewhere safe.

448
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,420
-我正打算如此  -本
- That's exactly what I'm gonna do. - Ben!

449
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,440
你得和我一起离开
You're coming with me.

450
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,240
维维安
Vivien!

451
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:15,310
维维安  是...孩子要出生了吗
Oh, Vivien, is-is the baby coming?

452
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,270
不
No!

453
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,450
不  不会这么早
No, it's too soon!

454
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,960
不  不  不
No, no, no!

455
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,230
不会的  亲爱的
No, honey.

456
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:24,260
如果孩子想出世  只能顺其自然
When a child is ready to be born, there's no stopping it.

457
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,150
-不  -快点  得把你抬到屋内
- No! - Come on, we got to get you to the house.

458
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,500
不
No!

459
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,200
我服了一些药
I took some pills.

460
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,800
并非存心想自杀
I didn't mean to kill myself.

461
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,270
本
Ben!

462
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,220
怎么了
What's wrong?!

463
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,660
孩子要出生了
The babies are coming.

464
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,630
不  不
No! No!

465
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,700
不
No!

466
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,130
放松
Take it easy, now.

467
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:55,350
记住要呼吸  呼气吸气
Don't forget to breathe. Breathe.

468
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,740
没信号
I can't get any service.

469
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,830
我得去医院
I got to go to the hospital now!

470
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,580
来不及了  已经能看到胎头了
It's too late for that; you're already crowning.

471
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,160
我去联系豪尔医生
I'm gonna call Dr. Hall.

472
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,080
让他们赶紧派辆救护车
We'll get you an ambulance right away.

473
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:05,120
呼气吸气  维维安  呼气吸气
Breathe, Vivien, breathe.

474
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,090
天呐   很痛
Oh, God! It hurts.

475
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:07,020
痛苦是难免的  亲爱的
Well, of course it does, honey.

476
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,800
女人就苦在这儿
That's a woman's curse.

477
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,900
她不能在这分娩
She can't give birth here.

478
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,940
不安全
It's not safe.

479
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,160
那就保护好她  你知道该怎么做
Well, then make it safe. You know what to do.

480
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:22,730
该死
Damn it.

481
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,630
我操
Shit!

482
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,380
给我滚开
Get away from there!

483
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,240
你们几个兔崽子快滚开
You kids get away from there!

484
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:57,350
哈蒙医生
Dr. Harmon.

485
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,180
是时候了
It's time.

486
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,100
护士  把我的医护包拿过来
Nurse, bring me my doctor bag.

487
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,370
这不对头
This is wrong.

488
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,390
给我找12号手术刀
Find me the 12-gauge scalpel.

489
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:18,400
我们得带你离开这儿
We have to get you out of here.

490
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,880
毛巾怎么还没来
Where are those towels?

491
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:24,940
铺在她身下
Spread them out underneath her.

492
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:34,550
这房子
This house.

493
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,440
这房子
This house!

494

醒醒
Wake up.

这所房子正竭尽全力帮你

497
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:45,220
此刻不容你拒绝
And right now, you are in no position to refuse.

498
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,280
你的妻子需要你
Your wife needs you.

499
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,790
你最好振作些  赶紧过去
So you better pull yourself together and get in there.

500
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,020
照顾好她
For her.

501
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,160
本

502

这些都是什么人
Who are all these people?

503
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:03,410
这些都是什么人
Who are these people?!

504
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,140
没事的  宝贝儿
It's okay, baby.

505
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,650
他们是来帮我们的
They're here to help us.

506
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:09,320
我都忘了分娩有多痛
I forgot how painful this is.

507
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,170
你有什么镇痛药吗  医生
Do you have a little something for her, Doctor?

508
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,060
乙醚
Ether.

509
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,860
缓和一下
Just to take the edge off.

00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:36,650
我感觉又要开始了

是个健康的小闺女

538
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,590
爸爸要过来切断脐带吗
Daddy, you want to cut the cord?

539
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,180
天呐
Oh, my God.

540
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,320

00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,730
瓦奥莱特
Violet.

542
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,260
这个孩子胎死腹中
Your baby is stillborn.

543
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,420
是男孩还是女孩
Is it a boy or a girl?

544
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:18,030
我能抱抱吗
Can I hold it?

545
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:21,990
不行
No.

546
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:23,930
还不行  亲爱的
Not just yet, sweetheart.

547
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:26,270
还有一个
You've got another one coming.

548
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:52,330
你到底在做什么  小姐
What exactly do you think you're doing, young lady?

549
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:55,660
我那一万二的名表是不是被你扔进火炉了
Is that my $12,000 watch that you're putting into the furnace?

550
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,990
克柔投安
Croatoan!

551

Croatoan!

553
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:13,590
开个玩笑
Just kidding.

554
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,790
谁给你出的这主意
So where'd you get that one?

555
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,920
是之前来过的那位连指甲都是假的灵媒吗
That press-on nail psychic who was here earlier?

556
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,180
不会吧  这你都信
I mean, really?

557

罗诺克咒语
The Roanoke spell?

我宁愿你
Please, tell me you'll be

559
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,650
切个鸡喉什么的
slitting the throat of a chicken next,

560
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:28,380
绝对能震撼到我
because I've always found that very dramatic.

561
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,950
详见本季第一集
你们之前烧鼠尾草净灵那招
I also quite enjoy the burning of the sage

562
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:33,140
也让我相当之雀跃
to rid the house of spirits.

563
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:35,180
-没用  -当然没用
- It didn't work. - Of course it didn't work.

564
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,060
纯粹瞎扯淡
It's bullshit.

565
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,560
完全是瞎扯
It's all bullshit.

566
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,060
人们杜撰这些咒语和圣歌
People make up these spells and chants

567
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,280
不过是为了营造一切都在掌控之中的幻觉
in order to feel like they're in control.

568
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,950
事实是
Well, guess what?

569
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,130
他们无法掌控
They're not.

570
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,870
也从未掌控过
Never have been.

571
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,670
你在做什么
What are you doing?

572
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,730
我自个儿的瞎扯淡仪式
My own bullshit ritual.

573
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,730
不会有什么育儿室
There's not gonna be any nursery.

574
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:59,710
我们也不会当父母
We're not gonna be parents.

575
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:03,340
你母亲的孩子将安然无恙
Your mother's babies are safe.

576
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,120
至少不会受到我们的伤害
From us, at least.

577
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,770
我注定要和一个不爱我的男人
I'm doomed to spend eternity

578
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:11,060
度过永生
with a man who doesn't love me.

579
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:13,210
当然  我这还不是最糟糕的
Of course, it could be worse.

580
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,900
你的男人虽然爱你...
Your man does love you...

581
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,110
可他永远都会是个怪物
but he'll always be a monster.

582
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,340
你错了
You're wrong.

583
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,800
泰特已经改过自新
Tate's changed.

584
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,840
他甚至都不记得曾经做过什么
He doesn't even remember what he did.

585
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,780
他什么时候改的
When did he change?

586
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:27,800
谋杀我之时吗
When he murdered me?

587
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,200
还是在他杀了我男友之时
When he murdered my boyfriend?

588
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:36,290
或者  是在他强奸了你母亲之后改变的
Or did he change when he raped your mother?

589
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:38,090
你说什么
What?

590
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,520
不  你在说谎
No, that's a lie.

591
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,670
是吗
Is it?

592
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,700
我想你就要发现真相了
I think you're about to find out.

593
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,620
维维安  吸气  你得吸气
Vivien, breathe. You have to breathe.

594
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,950
维维安  吸气呼气
Vivien, breathe!

595
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,540
你得深呼吸
You have to breathe!

596
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,900
-我现在要用钳子了  -怎么了
- I need forceps, now. - What's happening?

597
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,920
她难产了
It's dystocia.

598
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,350
耻骨联合
骨盆前方两片骨头间靠韧带及纤维软骨组织联接起来的区域
我得从耻骨联合处把孩子夹出来
I have to manilate the baby through the pubic symphysis.

599
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,880
不行了  本
I can't, Ben.

600
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,260
我不行了
I can't do it.

601
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:09,920
你可以的
You can do it.

602
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,860
我保证  看着我
I-I promise you. Look at me.

603
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,270
你可以做到的
You can do this.

604
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:17,220
哈蒙医生  等我说可以时再让你妻子用力
Dr. Harmon, have your wife stop pushing until I say so.

605
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,530
维维安  听得见我说话吗
Vivien, can you hear me?

606
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:21,530
我说用力时  你再用力
You have to stop pushing until I tell you.

607
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:27,190
我快痛死了
It hurts so much!

608
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:30,610
用你最大的力气抓我的手  握紧
Squeeze my hand as hard as you can! Squeeze!

609
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,050
准备纱布止血
Get the gauze ready to stop the bleeding.

610
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,590
-就现在  哈蒙医生  -用力  维维安
- Now, Dr. Harmon. - Push, Vivien!

611
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,320
你得用力  用力
You have to push! Push!

612
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,600
用力  用力
Push! Push!

613
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,790
孩子要出来了
He's coming.

614
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:42,510
使劲  你做的很棒  小维
Push! You're doing great, Viv!

615
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,560
你做的很棒  小维
You're doing great, Viv.

616
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,580
天啊  我要被撕裂了
Oh, God, it's ripping me apart!

617
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,050
别停下  亲爱的
Don't stop, angel!

618
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:49,230
就快结束了  我看见他了
The end is in sight. I can see him.

619
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,250
你成功了  宝贝
You did it, babe.

620
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,430
亲爱的  你成功了
Honey, you did it.

621
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,960
成功了
You did it.

622
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:23,140
-一切还好吗  -她在流血
- Is everything all right? - She's bleeding.

623
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:24,380
我得先止血
I have to stop the bleeding.

624
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,450
把脐带剪了  该分开母亲和孩子了
Cut the cord. It's time to separate mother and son.

625
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,760
我能看下孩子吗
Can I see the baby?

626
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:32,070
把他给我
Hand him to me.

627
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:38,260
我先为他擦洗下  马上就带回来
I'll get him washed up. I'll bring him right back.

628
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:56,510
医生  一切都还好吗
Doctor, is everything all right?

629
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,560
你是不是有毛病
Oh, what is the matter with you?

630
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,330
他是我见过最漂亮的婴儿
He's the most beautiful baby I've ever seen.

631
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,820
鲜血和痛苦造就了孩子的完美
From blood and pain come perfection.

632
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:40,220
婊子们
Hey, bitches.

633
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:43,280
我孩子身上的黏液  你们弄干净了吗
You get all that slime off my baby yet?

634
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,540
护士  用力压住这里
Nurse, I need pressure on this.

635
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,080
到底是怎么回事
What the hell is going on?

636
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,950
她快要休克了  我止不住大出血
She's going into shock. I can't stop the hemorrhaging.

637
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:52,750
维维安  别离开我
Vivien, stay with me.

638
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,730
维维安
Vivien.

639
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,630
妈妈
Mom...

640
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,270
瓦奥莱特
Violet.

641
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,550
很抱歉我没去医院看望你
I'm sorry I didn't go see you at the hospital.

642
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:06,920
我想去  但我不能够去
I wanted to, but I couldn't.

643
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:10,750
可现在你在啊  这才是最关键的
You're here now-- that's all that matters.

644
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:11,720
维维安
Vivien.

645
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,830
听我说
Listen to me.

646
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:18,170
留心听我的话
Concentrate on my words.

647
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,300
我们会幸福的  亲爱的
We can be happy, honey.

648
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,340
就像以前一样幸福
Just like we were before.

649
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:26,020
就像在我出轨之前
Before my mistakes,

650
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:28,330
搬进这屋子之前一样幸福
before this house.

651
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,270
没事的  妈妈
It's okay, Mom.

652
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,250
如果你感到痛苦
If you're in pain,

653
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:35,120
就随它去吧
let go.

654
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:40,750
看来我别无选择了
I don't think I have a choice.

655
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,350
坚持住  维维安  别离开我
Hold on, Vivien. Stay with me.

656
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:47,500
来我这边吧
Come to this side.

657
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,840
就随它去吧
Let go.

658
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:51,690
你可以和我在一起
You can be with me.

659
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,440
不要死
Don't die.

660
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,790
不准给我死  维维安
Don't die on me, Vivien.

661
00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:00,630
我们仍要共度一生
We can still have a life together.

662
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,670
我们仍会幸福的
We can still be happy.

663
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,080
我妈妈死了
My mom is dead.

664
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,180
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

665
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,680
我知道你们母女很亲近
I know you were close.

666
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:13,730
是的  我们很亲
Yeah, we were.

667
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,750
现在就剩我爸孤零零地在楼下了
My dad's down there all alone now.

668
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:22,870
我很难过
That makes me sad.

669
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:24,580
我喜欢你爸爸
I like your dad.

670
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,940
他对我很好
He was nice to me.

671
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,850
他对所有的病人都很好
He's nice to all his patients.

672
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:30,270
-甚至是那些对他撒谎的病人  -什么
- Even the ones who lie to him. - What?

673
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,640
当初为什么要请他帮你看病
Why did you start seeing him in the first place?

674
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:34,700
康丝坦斯觉得你需要帮助
Constance thought you needed help.

675
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,180
是的  我确实需要
I did. I do.

676
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,430
你知道自己已经死了
You knew you were dead.

677
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,070
是的
Yeah.

678
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,410
我知道
I knew.

679
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,040
知道是怎么死的吗
Do you know why?

680
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,420
警察开枪打死了我
The cops shot me.

681
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:51,070
就在这里  在这间房里
Right here in this room.

682
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:54,280
为什么  为什么他们要开枪打你
Why? Why did they shoot you?

683
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,600
我不知道
I don't know.

684
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:04,170
因为你杀了人  泰特
You murdered people, Tate.

685
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,300
杀了像我们这样的孩子
Kids. Like us.

686
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,390
就是万圣节那晚来找我们的孩子
The kids that came to us on Halloween.

687
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:13,780
我为什么要这么做
Why would I do that?

688
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,580
我为什么要这么做
Why would I do that?

689
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:19,050
我为什么要这么做
Why would I do that?

690
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:23,400
不可能  我为什么要这么做
No... Why would I do that?

691
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,120
我不知道
I don't know.

692
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:28,520
为什么你杀了先前住在这里的那俩家伙
Why'd you kill those guys who lived here before us?

693
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:31,270
为什么你要强奸我妈妈
Why would you rape my mother?

694
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,150
对不起
I'm sorry.

695
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,040
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

696
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,780
后来我就变了
I was different then.

697
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,280
我曾以为你和我一样
I used to think you were like me.

698
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:46,190
是被罪恶的事物所吸引
You were attracted to the darkness,

699
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,790
但  泰特  你就是罪恶的化身
but, Tate, you are the darkness.

700
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,110
不是的  只是在遇见你之前
No. Before you,

701
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,640
我是这样的

不管它是婴儿还是别的什么

What?

719
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,780
不不  别这么做
