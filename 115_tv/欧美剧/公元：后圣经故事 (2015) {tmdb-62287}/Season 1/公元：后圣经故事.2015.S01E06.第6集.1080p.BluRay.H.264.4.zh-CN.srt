1
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:58,560
第一季第六集

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,430
我绝不会心慈手软
There will be no mercy!

3
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,950
《公元》前情提要

4
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,960
我妹妹的独子被钉在十字架上
My sister's only child hanging from a cross!

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,070
约瑟  我们需要结束这一切
Joseph... we need this to end!

6
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:14,730
我们必须依照我们的法律
We must govern ourselves

7
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,950
才可以无需臣服于罗马的铁蹄
so that we are never again subjected to Roman justice.

8
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,290
反正你没做过任何有价值的事
You did nothing of any worth whatsoever.

9
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,490
给希律・安提帕斯王让路
Make way for king antipas.

10
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,480
你的地位要依靠我的支持
Your position is reliant on my endorsement.

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,980
约翰  我的灵魂深处也贫穷和苦难
John, I'm poor and sick in my soul.

12
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,600
我很高兴能把这块地给你们
I'm glad to give you this land.

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,440
巴拿巴  完美至极
Barnabas, it's perfect.

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,530
神对每个人都有他的旨意  我意在布道
God has a purpose for each of us. I'm meant to preach.

15
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,500
要有耐心  司提反  时机将到
Be patient, Stephen. The time will come.

16
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,270
耶稣难道没说过
And didn't Jesus say,

17
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,450
"我会铲平这座圣殿  在三天内重建"
"I will rebuild this temple in three days"

18
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,000
就在被你处死后复生之前
Before he rose from the death you condemned him to?

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,570
让他闭嘴  让他闭嘴
Silence him. Shut him up.

20
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,430
耶稣啊  接受我的灵
Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.

21
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:22,120
"你的国将不再有暴力的消息
"No longer will violence be heard in your lands,

22
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,210
"你的地也不会有破坏和毁灭
"nor ruin and destruction within your borders.

23
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,270
"你的墙
"your walls

24
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,440
"应被称为救赎
"shall be called salvation,

25
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,100
"你的门都祈祷
"and your gates praise.

26
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,410
"你的昼
"No longer will the sun

27
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,910
"不再有日光照耀
"light your days

28
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,930
"你的夜不再有月光点亮
"nor the moon bright your night.

29
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:56,290
"你将获得主的永恒光芒
"You will have the lord for everlasting light

30
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,540
"和你神赐的天福"
"and your god for your glory."

31
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:19,300
我儿子死了  司提反死了
My son is dead! Stephen is dead!

32
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,110
是因为你  你和你的政治
Because of you! You and your politics!

33
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,350
他在哪
Where is he?

34
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:28,000
你的那个弥赛亚  他现在在哪
Where is he now, this Messiah of yours?

35
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,610
他为什么不复活他
Why doesn't he raise him up

36
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,320
或让那个主把司提反带回我们身边
or ask the Lord to bring Stephen back to us?

37
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,610
我们有资格试验他吗
Is it for us to test him?

38
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,160
我昨晚梦到
I dreamt last night

39
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,090
司提反不是最后一个死亡的
that Stephen wouldn't be the last of us to die.

40
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,280
另一个饥饿的灵魂听到了布道
Another hungry soul that's heard the word.

41
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,760
主与你同在
God be with you.

42
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,070
你是来听耶稣的布道的吗
Have you come to hear the word of Jesus?

43
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,890
不
No.

44
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,180
我叫扫罗
I am saul.

45
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,970
学者  犹太人  罗马公民  法利赛教徒
Scholar, Jew, Roman citizen, Pharisee,

46
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,300
耶路撒冷大圣殿的护卫
defender of the great temple of Jerusalem.

47
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,550
我来让你们看看
I have come to teach you of the wrath

48
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:34,050
你们如果不停止亵渎神明的行为
you will all bring down upon yourselves

49
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:37,790
会给自己带来怎样的惩罚
if you do not end your blasphemy.

50
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,460
如果
If.

51
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,600
荒漠和干渴的土地会喜悦
The desert and the parched land will be glad.

52
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,050
荒野会欢欣
The wilderness will rejoice...

53
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,620
绽放花朵
and blossom.

54
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,850
想番红花一样
Like the crocus,

55
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,020
绽开花朵
It will burst into bloom.

56
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,500
它会极尽欢欣
It will rejoice greatly...

57
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,900
大声欢呼
...and shout for joy.

58
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,840
所以  告诉我们
So, tell us,

59
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,550
我们的信仰怎么会如此错误
how are we so wrong in our belief?

60
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,010
朋友  跟我们说句话
Friend, speak with us.

61
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,250
你怎么了  没有舌头吗
What's the matter, have you no tongue?

62
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,940
还是没有脑子
Or no brain?

63
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,300
拿撒勒的耶稣
Jesus of Nazareth,

64
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:07,470
你们爱戴和歌颂的这个乡下弥赛亚
this peasant Messiah you love and praise,

65
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,990
不过是一个假先知
is nothing more than a false prophet.

66
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,040
你居然有胆量来这说出这种言辞
You dare come here and say that?

67
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,390
不是我说的  公会这么说
I don't say it. The Sanhedrin says it.

68
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,060
所罗门的诗篇上这么说
The psalms of Solomon say it.

69
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,700
耶利米  以赛亚和丹尼尔的预言都这么说
The prophecies of Jeremiah, Isaiah, and Daniel say it.

70
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,810
你又有何资格唱反调
Who are you to say otherwise?

71
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:32,930
有何资格
Who?

72
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,020
怎么了
What's the matter?

73
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,210
没有舌头吗
Have you no tongue?

74
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,820
还是没勇气说了
No courage?

75
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,160
走吧  小个子
Be gone, little man.

76
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,050
我真不明白你怎么想的  约拿单
I don't understand you, Jonathan.

77
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,970
你看到了这些屠杀  一波波酷刑
You saw the slaughter, the wave of crucifixions,

78
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,860
你看到耶路撒冷已被混乱占据
saw what bloody turmoil made its home in Jerusalem.

79
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,510
当然  父亲  我的眼睛很好
Of course. Father, I'm not blind.

80
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:24,020
你还容忍了该亚法  以大祭司的身份
And you accept that Caiaphas, as high priest,

81
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,880
染上这些血债
stands knee-deep in blood.

82
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,210
死亡是借罗马强兵之权的彼拉多带来的
Blood spilled by Pilate wielding the power of Rome.

83
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:34,530
是的  我也承认该亚法的处理有失
Yes, I accept Caiaphas has not handled things well.

84
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:38,410
那你为什么不同意换掉他呢
So, why can't you accept that he must be replaced?

85
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,030
耶路撒冷需要一个
Jerusalem needs a man who will forge

86
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,890
能改变和罗马人关系的人
a different relationship with Rome

87
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,840
带我们回到以前该亚法带来的
to take us back to the peaceful times

88
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,090
和平时代
Caiaphas once stood for.

89
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,990
公会期待能有人站出来挑战该亚法
The Sanhedrin is looking for a man to challenge Caiaphas.

90
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,850
亚那家族
The Annas family

91
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,810
希望你可以当此重任
needs that man to be you.

92
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:09,150
你可爱的家族
The whole idea of your loving family

93
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,650
要挤在我们的家里致谢的事
gathered in our house to give thanks

94
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:12,730
让我寝食不安
gives me indigestion.

95
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:15,700
那喝一剂药醒醒神吧
Well, take a potion. Clear your head.

96
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:22,350
两位贵客不请自来了
Two guests of honor have invited themselves.

97
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,240
能提前通知一下就更好了
Although a little more notice wouldn't have hurt.

98
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,150
安提帕斯和希罗底
Antipas and Herodias.

99
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,940
我都不知道拿撒勒人的营地
I had no idea the Nazarene camp

100
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,380
已经离城市如此近了
was so close to the city.

101
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,210
而且声势浩大
And so populated.

102
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:47,140
为什么会有人抛弃自己熟知的一切
Why would anyone leave everything they knew

103
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,720
去过这种日子
to live like that?

104
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:55,420
普林节之际大家能光临寒舍
We are honored the festival of purim

105
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,080
是我们莫大的荣幸
has brought you to our home.

106
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,270
其实  这也是个来耶路撒冷的好借口
In truth, it was a useful excuse to come to Jerusalem.

107
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,400
为了来看看它是否还屹立于此
To see if the city was still standing.

108
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,280
我儿子和我认为
My son and I think,

109
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,900
作为犹太人  我们该谈谈最近的黑暗时期
as Jews, we can talk honestly about recent dark days.

110
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:16,120
人民不会很快淡忘那些死在
The people will not soon forget the blood spilled

111
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,420
彼拉多总督酷刑下的亡灵
in governor Pilate's wave of crucifixions.

112
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,610
他们也不该忘记
They shouldn't forget.

113
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:22,880
但人民何时又曾满意过呢
But was there ever a time when the people were content?

114
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,450
如果人民的怒火可以消去
If the anger of the people was fading,

115
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,870
你大可如此沾沾自喜
there would be room for this complacent approach.

116
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,330
父亲  我们并没有自满
Father, we are hardly complacent.

117
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,480
但人民的怒火愈燃愈旺
But the anger is growing,

118
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,300
随着城外沙漠上的流动城市愈发壮大
just as the new city of tents out in the desert is growing.

119
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,300
你是说营地吗
You mean the camp?

120
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,960
现在都有上千个了
There are thousands there now.

121
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,920
没错
Yes.

122
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,140
来的路上我们路过了那里
We passed it on our way here.

123
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,670
它会发展成什么样
Where will it stop?

124
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,480
五千追随者吗
At 5,000 converts?

125
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,540
或者十万
100,000?

126
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,190
大家能不能别再谈
Will everybody please stop

127
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,380
这些人了
going on about these people?

128
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:13,220
告诉我  你到底想让我怎么做
Tell me, what exactly is it that you'd have me do?

129
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,400
去他们的帐篷里直接杀掉他们吗
Have them slaughtered in their tents?

130
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,990
安提帕斯  当然  这些百姓
Antipas, surely, the people --

131
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,440
还有你  他们的统治者
and you, as their ruler --

132
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,670
都希望有个能管事的大祭司
want to see a High Priest in control of events.

133
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,320
而不是由他们领导
Not led by them.

134
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,110
不是任罗马总督随心所欲地支配
Not governed by the whim of his Roman master.

135
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,790
我很喜欢这种叛变的味道
I do enjoy the smell of treachery.

136
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,330
可怜的该亚法就像
Poor old Caiaphas has the look of a man

137
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,370
一个行将赴死的人
preparing to face the executioner.

138
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,500
如果要在他
If it was a choice

139
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,880
和年轻的约拿单中选一个做大祭司
between him and young Jonathan as High Priest,

140
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,890
我都不知道该选哪个
I don't know who I'd go for.

141
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:06,940
都别选
Neither.

142
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,170
但我必须支持一个
But I'll have to give my support to one of them,

143
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,600
然后让彼拉多来决定
and then let Pilate have the responsibility.

144
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,440
女士
My lady.

145
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,350
然后是别是巴的撒迦利亚
And then there was Zachary of Beersheba,

146
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,080
一个让热情冲昏了头脑的人
a passionate man who tried to follow

147
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,110
他想要效仿摩西
the example of Moses

148
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:25,810
于是带领他的弟兄穿越红海
and lead his friends across the Red Sea.

149
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:29,190
他溺水死了  他们都死了
He drowned, and so did they.

150
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,150
还有比利亚的西门
And then there was Simon from Peraea --

151
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:35,070
勇敢多谋的西门
brave, well-intentioned Simon.

152
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,740
他自以为由上帝差来
Well, he believed that he was sent by God

153
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,250
但只是让犹太人的生活更
but only made a Jew's life ha--

154
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,710
但只是让犹太人在罗马统治下的生活更艰难
but only made a Jew's life harder under Rome.

155
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,590
另外还有个冒牌货
And there was another pretender --

156
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,690
来自加利利的骗子
an imposter from Galilee,

157
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:55,790
耶稣
this man Jesus.

158
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,620
你是彼得  我听过你传道
You're Peter. I've heard you preach.

159
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,510
讲得不错
You do it well.

160
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:04,130
或许有点过于动情了  但
A little softhearted, perhaps, but...

161
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:09,070
我可以举个例子来击破你那虚假的弥赛亚
I have a case to make against your false Messiah!

162
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,600
你愿意听吗  彼得
Do you want to hear it, Peter,

163
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,500
还是害怕我当着这些蒙昧的群众
or are you afraid I will unpick your delusions

164
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,770
揭穿你的诡诈之言
in front of this gullible crowd?

165
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,380
这个人生活在黑暗中
This man is living in darkness

166
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,590
甚至不知道自己的双眼已被蒙蔽
and doesn't even know his eyes are closed.

167
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,840
他自称知晓这些
He claims such knowledge,

168
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,140
但也不过是在黑夜中蹒跚
but he's just stumbling in the dark

169
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,740
如果没有意识到这点
if he doesn't know this --

170
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,930
若不籍著耶稣
no one can come to the Father

171
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,920
没有人能到天父那里去
except through Jesus.

172
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,490
耶稣就是道路
Jesus is the way

173
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:37,390
真理  生命
and the truth and the life.

174
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:40,300
你们的耶稣
This Jesus of yours

175
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,010
被这些文盲渔夫奉为先知
is nothing more than a false prophet

176
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,340
不过是个冒牌货
of illiterate fishermen.

177
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,550
你们全被他投入了谎言的罗网中
He has you all in a net of lies.

178
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,760
约翰
John!

179
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:57,040
你对待自己的言语
You use words

180
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,810
就如商人对待卖出的石头
like a trader selling stones.

181
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:03,170
这当中没有真心  没有爱
There's no heart to them, no love.

182
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:06,410
我有  爱
I have...love

183
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,920
对你想毁掉的那些东西
for those things you want to destroy --

184
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,880
耶路撒冷中心的圣殿
the temple in the heart of Jerusalem,

185
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,010
几个世纪的律法与传统
centuries of law and tradition.

186
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:15,510
你那可悲的小团体
Your pathetic little band can no more replace

187
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,150
不过是鞋里的小跳蚤
than a flea can fill the shoes of a man.

188
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,940
简单来说
Speak simply.

189
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,420
哪怕你的思想中有一点真理
If there is truth to your thoughts,

190
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,020
人们都会理解你
you'll be understood.

191
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,200
我就说个简单的真理
Here's a simple truth --

192
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:32,310
如果要与圣殿为敌
if you set yourself against the temple,

193
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:36,790
你必将为圣殿所毁
you will be destroyed by the temple.

194
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,300
简单明了的
Simple.

195
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,240
真理
Truth.

196
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,700
就算我能说服公会
Even if I could persuade the Sanhedrin

197
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,130
信任你们的家族
to trust your family,

198
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,940
谁又能对越来越多的同胞
Who stood by while more and more

199
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,310
被钉死在十字架上视若无睹
of our people were crucified.

200
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,440
-并没有...  -就算我愿意
- There was nothing -- - And even if I was willing to speak

201
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,640
为你们辩解  为你们争取到
in your defense and so gain for you

202
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,930
足以推翻该亚法的支持者
the support you'll need to unseat Caiaphas

203
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:59,560
并弥补由你们所造成的伤害
and heal the wounds you've caused,

204
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,490
你就不为
have you no shame

205
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,020
密谋推翻自己女婿的行为感到羞耻吗
that you'd plot against your own son-in-law?

206
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:06,240
我很羞耻
I have shame.

207
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,940
羞耻于我没能尽早行动
Shame that I didn't act sooner

208
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,400
挽救那些身处水火之中的人们
to save so many from their pain.

209
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:15,610
那些不幸身亡和像你一样的人们
Those who died and those, like you,

210
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,790
那些失去挚爱的人们
who lost the ones they loved.

211
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,160
我们请求你不要让那失败
We ask you to not let that failing

212
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,720
带来更多的鲜血和折磨
cost more blood and suffering,

213
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,780
在我们重新开始时  不让那些时刻被遗忘
not to let the moment pass when we can act to start afresh.

214
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:32,450
我儿子约拿单是个正直的人
My son Jonathan is a man of integrity

215
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:35,470
会真心实意地传达耶路撒冷人民的心声
who will truly speak for the people of Jerusalem.

216
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:38,030
他是唯一一个能带来这两样...
The only man who can bring both --

217
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:47,110
变革和延续的人
both change and continuity.

218
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,310
在你向彼拉多提出这个提议之前
Before you even think of making the case to Pilate,

219
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,810
他需要安提帕斯毫无保留的支持
He'll need the unreserved backing of Antipas.

220
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:58,820
彼拉多会想要他的批准来维持秩序
Pilate will want his approval to maintain order.

221
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,580
如果有了你的支持
If, with your support,

222
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,080
我们能够将公会的人团结起来
we can unite the Sanhedrin behind us,

223
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,850
我们今天就能去找安提帕斯
we can approach Antipas today.

224
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,480
我保证  你不会后悔的
You won't regret this, I promise.

225
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,830
这个男人会让你们相信
This man would have you believe

226
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,490
一个被钉死的弥赛亚
in a crucified Messiah.

227
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,960
《申命记》中写到
Deuteronomy says,

228
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,830
"凡是吊死于树上或是十字架的人
"For he that is hanged on a tree or on a cross

229
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,580
均遭上帝诅咒"
is accursed of God."

230
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,540
但上帝令他复活
But God raised him up,

231
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,840
将他从死亡中解脱出来
having loosed him from the pains of death

232
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,710
因为他不会为死亡所困
because it was not possible he should be held by it.

233
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,990
这是你的说法
So you claim,

234
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,840
但你们之中有谁亲眼见到了复生
but who among you has seen the resurrection?

235
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,920
谁
Who?

236
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,140
你看见了吗
You?

237
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,730
你呢  你呢
You? You?

238
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:52,810
只有这个需要你们相信这个故事的骗子
Only your charlatans, who need you to believe it.

239
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:57,010
耶稣和他的话备受爱戴
Jesus and the truth of his message are loved.

240
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,740
被我们所有的同胞爱戴吗
By all our people?

241
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,640
连耶路撒冷人都不尽全信
Not even by all of Jerusalem.

242
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,640
他们对他的爱戴如此至少
They loved him so little...

243
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,810
甚至处死了他
they executed him.

244
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,780
实现了以赛亚的预言
And fulfilled Isaiah's prophecy.

245
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,490
弥赛亚是一个
The Messiah is a man

246
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:14,970
不幸的  深知惨痛的男人
of sorrows and acquainted with grief.

247
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:19,030
这个人认为你们的挚爱被处决
This man thinks it's a mark of success

248
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:22,530
是成功的象征
when those you love are executed.

249
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,600
你们都死光了他才会开心
He won't be happy until you're all dead...

250
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,050
就像司提反
Like Stephen.

251
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,110
你要是再待在这里
If you stay here one moment longer,

252
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:34,640
我发誓  我会拔下你的头
I swear I'm going to tear your head off.

253
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,020
别担心
Don't worry.

254
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,610
我已经听到足够多的话
I've heard enough to see

255
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:45,030
让我明白你们不会放弃这种错觉的理由
that reason won't break you from your delusions.

256
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,640
但你们还会再见到我
You will see me again, though.

257
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,900
我保证
Be sure of that.

258
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:00,980
迦玛列拉比
Rabbi Gamaliel,

259
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,710
这些沙漠中的渎神者
how can these blasphemers in the desert

260
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,190
为什么会想要结束这一切
want to end all this?

261
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,110
不要关心他们的事
Don't concern yourself with them.

262
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,910
管好你自己的学习吧
Look to your own studies.

263
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,940
提高自己的理解力  然后...
Improve your understanding, and then --

264
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,950
我知道  但他们就是看不到
Yes, but they just don't see

265
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,880
这些...所有这些
that this -- all of this --

266
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,610
正是耶路撒冷的心脏和灵魂
is the heart and soul of Jerusalem.

267
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,820
我想告诉他们  但他们不肯讲道理
I tried to tell them, but they just won't see reason.

268
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,550
那么  扫罗  不要再把你的时间
Then, Saul, don't spend more of your energy

269
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:31,340
浪费在纠正他们的错误上
trying to correct their mistake.

270
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,660
我看到了你的前途  从学者到拉比
I see a path for you from scholar to Rabbi,

271
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,260
也许还会从拉比
from Rabbi to, perhaps,

272
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,790
变成公会的一员
a seat on the Sanhedrin.

273
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,530
谁知道呢
Who knows?

274
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,670
这些人
These men,

275
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,180
跟公会做的是一样的事
they do the same work as the Sanhedrin.

276
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,970
辛勤工作着  为了保留旧的传统
They toil to preserve the old

277
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,490
使它保持活力
while making it new.

278
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:56,860
而这个渔夫彼得和其他人想做的
What this fisherman Peter and the others want to do

279
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,860
却是毁灭传统
is destroy the old,

280
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,240
用新的一套来代替它
replace it with the new.

281
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,760
我必须想出办法来阻止他们
I have to find a way to stop them.

282
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,630
我必须这么做
I have to.

283
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,740
我觉得事情进展顺利
I think that went well.

284
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,230
给您
For you.

285
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,300
周年纪念礼物
An anniversary gift.

286
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,370
在你离开我们家之后
After you left our house,

287
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:37,910
我妻子提醒我  正是在十年前的普珥日
my wife reminded me that it was at Purim 10 years ago

288
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,470
我们第一次相见
that we first met.

289
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,820
我作为大祭司
Me as High Priest,

290
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,630
你作为加利利和比利亚的分封王
you as Tetrarch of Galilee and Perea.

291
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,890
我们都想把对方除掉
Each trying to work the other out.

292
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,360
而到了今天  我们也仍然在这么做
And here we are, still trying.

293
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:50,890
请吧
Please.

294
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:57,060
那么  你的岳父和他的儿子
So, your father-in-law and his son

295
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,130
很想从你这里抢走
would very much like to take from you

296
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,870
你所穿戴的高贵的祭司袍
those fine robes of office that you wear.

297
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,740
那么
Now...

298
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,540
你打算如何处置
What are you going to do

299
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,530
这些沙漠中的狂热之徒呢
about these fanatics in the desert?

300
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:12,940
这场狂热崇拜的主谋  他们跟随的头目
The ringleader of the cult, the man they follow,

301
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,400
是加利利人
is from Galilee.

302
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:17,270
这对我的形象影响十分恶劣
This reflects very badly on me.

303
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:20,710
他们很快就会对于跟随他们的弥赛亚
They will soon tire of the hardships

304
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:24,330
所带来的苦难而感到厌倦的
that come from following their... Messiah.

305
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,860
但那样又能如何呢
But what happens?

306
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,420
异议成了造反
Dissent becomes revolt.

307
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:31,250
罗马的应对将会带来毁灭
The Roman response could be devastating.

308
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,700
为我解决这个麻烦  该亚法
Solve this problem for me, Caiaphas.

309
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:40,410
如果这场推翻你的密谋呈到彼拉多那里
And if this attempt to overthrow you reaches Pilate,

310
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,800
我会支持你
you will have my support.

311
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,200
我们知道你在跟我父亲和我哥哥
We know you're conspiring

312
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,090
密谋些什么事
with my father and brother.

313
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,050
我不懂你在说什么呢
Should I know what you're talking about?

314
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,430
这场战斗  你们三个是赢不了的
The three of you won't win this fight.

315
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:02,420
我丈夫仍然会继续做大祭司
My husband will remain in office as high priest,

316
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,150
而你们则会因背叛遭到报应
and you will suffer for your betrayal.

317
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,250
你丈夫已经失势了
Tide is turning against your husband,

318
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,340
我也无法阻止时局
and I can't stand in the way of it.

319
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,160
如果你们意识不到这一点
If you don't recognize that,

320
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,350
你们都将被滔滔洪水所淹没
you'll both drown in the flood.

321
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,010
大祭司今天还有更多的事要做
The High Priest has more to deal with today

322
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,140
比你想象得要多
than you can even imagine.

323
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,230
而你却认为我应该把他
And you think that I should bring him

324
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:23,410
-带来这里见你  -是的
- out here to talk to you? - Yes.

325
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,320
三天后再来
Come back in three days.

326
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,530
你得到的回复还会是一样
The answer will still be the same,

327
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,950
但至少我有足够的时间忘记你
but at least it'll give me chance to forget you.

328
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,270
三天后  圣殿很可能会面临加倍的危险
In three days, the danger to the temple could be doubled.

329
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,530
圣殿会有什么危险
What danger to the temple?

330
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,220
原谅我  我
Forgive me. I...

331
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,700
我只是在说沙漠里聚集的那些
I was merely talking about the followers of the false Messiah

332
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,930
伪弥赛亚的门徒
gathering in the desert.

333
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,200
跟我来
Come with me.

334
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,950
听说你想要见我
You wanted to see me?

335
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,120
谢谢您的恩典
Thank you for your good grace.

336
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,150
我在圣殿档案馆读到过很多
Having read much in the temple archives

337
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,680
您家族的伟大历史
of your family's great history,

338
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,430
我满怀着敬意  希望
I hope that, with respect --

339
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:03,340
我们可以少一些繁文缛节吗
Could we perhaps have a little less respect?

340
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,190
-时间紧迫  -当然
- Time kills us all. - Of course.

341
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,660
我相信我们有着共同的兴趣
I believe we share a common interest,

342
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,570
共同的愿望
a common desire

343
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:19,170
想要把某群害虫赶出耶路撒冷
to rid Jerusalem of a pest --

344
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,100
那些渔夫和他们的追随者
the fishermen and their followers

345
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,870
在城外的势力和自信心
growing in numbers and confidence

346
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,830
日益膨胀
outside the city walls.

347
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:30,490
你为什么会希望他们离开
And what is it that fuels your desire to see them gone?

348
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,160
他们令我感到厌恶
They offend me.

349
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,980
他们想要破坏圣殿
Their actions to undermine the temple,

350
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,420
他们的挑衅行为激怒了我
their defiance offends me.

351
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,970
他们公然反抗公会
Their defiance of the Sanhedrin,

352
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:39,770
即使公会已经
who could not have been more

353
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,720
非常明确地裁决...
definitive in their verdict when they said --

354
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,860
你到底想要我怎么样
What exactly do you want?

355
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,660
我希望您能授权我
The authority to...

356
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,620
代表您
act on your behalf

357
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,230
来解决这个问题
and solve this problem --

358
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,990
彻底赶走这些亵渎者
to remove these blasphemers so completely

359
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:03,720
不让其留下一丁点儿蛛丝马迹
that not even the stain of their memory is left behind.

360
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,730
我一直在想着司提反
I just can't stop thinking about Stephen.

361
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:22,360
不要再这样了
Stop being such a man.

362
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,950
什么
What?

363
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,370
你看见了葬礼上的女人
You see the women at the funeral.

364
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,810
她们哭泣哀号
They weep and they wail

365
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:33,490
把痛苦全都发泄出来
and they scream out their pain

366
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:35,910
那样全世界就了解她们的悲痛
so the whole world knows about it.

367
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:39,850
而当女人不加掩饰的悲痛散播开来时
And while all this openhearted grieving goes on,

368
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,680
男人却都都低垂眉目
the men look at their feet

369
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,970
只摆出悲伤的表情
and put on their sad face.

370
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,760
不要闷在心里
Don't bottle it up.

371
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,620
释放你的痛苦
Let out that pain.

372
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,690
引领我们  以此来纪念司提反  彼得
Honor Stephen by leading us, Peter.

373
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:23,810
我需要您给予我
What I need is for you to give me the authority

374
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:27,210
最低级别圣殿守卫所拥有的权限
you would give the least promoted of your temple guard.

375
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,700
你要如何使用这一权限
Authority to use how?

376
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,930
给我配备20个圣殿守卫
And 20 men from that guard.

377
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,570
他们的力量在于其群众基础
Their strength is their popularity.

378
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,700
我要破坏掉他们的群众基础
I want to take that from them.

379
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,380
你们都有疑惑
You have questions.

380
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:53,070
你们说  "为什么他称我为他的磐石"
You say, "Why did he call me his rock?"

381
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:57,330
你们问  "我是他的基石吗
You ask, "Am I the foundation?

382
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:01,770
他的教会将会建造在这里吗"
Is this where his church will be built?"

383
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,380
只有一个基石
There is only one foundation stone.

384
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,190
他的名字就是耶稣基督
And his name is Jesus Christ!

385
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:11,400
而他的教会也不是这里
And his church is not here.

386
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,570
既不在这营帐 亦或那石墙中
It's not in those tents or these walls.

387
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:18,190
而在你们所有人心中
It's you -- all of you.

388
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,540
你们就是他的教会
You are his church.

389
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:25,200
就像那些虽未亲见耶稣复活
And like those we asked to believe

390
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,630
却响应我们  皈依天主的人一样
even though they didn't see him rise again,

391
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:31,110
我们必须抛却畏惧
we must push away our fear

392
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:36,100
哪怕要为此遭受迫害
even as we recognize the persecution we face.

393
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:40,220
我们必须去耶路撒冷
We have to go to Jerusalem

394
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,610
广布真言
and preach the word

395
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:45,480
建立他的教会
to build his church!

396
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,000
人你自己去招
Recruit your own men.

397
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,850
钱我出
I'll pay.

398
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:09,700
恕我直言
Forgive me,

399
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:13,350
如果人们看见是您出手
but wouldn't it benefit your authority

400
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:17,310
不正有利于您巩固地位吗
to be seen as the hand at work?

401
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:26,090
我们必须从神殿长老和他们罗马主子那儿
We need to claim back the true message of our faith

402
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:30,090
夺回我们信仰真谛的解释权
from the families of the temple and their masters from Rome.

403
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:37,890
他们杀掉了那个说过此话的人
They crucified the man who said to you,

404
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:41,170
"我是世界的光
"I am the light of the world.

405
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:45,690
跟从我的  就不在黑暗里走"
Whoever follows me won't walk in darkness."

406
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:48,410
而我  亲眼见到了他
And with my own eyes, I saw him.

407
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:52,830
我们刚刚埋葬了一个好人  一位挚友
We just buried a man -- a good man and a friend.

408
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:57,580
就因为他敢于说出真相  就遭石刑而死
Stoned to death because he dared speak the truth.

409
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,800
他和你们一样  都很年轻
He was a young man, like you.

410
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:04,590
他像你们一样  流了血  受了苦
He shed blood and felt pain, just like you.

411
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:08,070
像你们一样  他的母亲为他落泪
His mother wept tears for him, just as yours would.

412
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:12,210
但他仍无所畏惧地大声说出天主的真言
But he had a burning need to speak the truth of the word of god.

413
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:15,270
奉大祭司该亚法之命
With the authority of high priest Caiaphas,

414
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:17,860
我乃是大数人扫罗
I, Saul of Tarsus,

415
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:21,820
指控在场所有人等支持渎神谬论
hereby accuse all the people here of supporting blasphemy!

416
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,280
你们可看见了
Do you see this?

417
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,210
这些罗马人的奴仆对我们大加迫害
These friends of Rome standing against us?

418
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:29,010
这就是你的回应吗  诉诸暴力
Is this your answer? Violence?

419
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,910
你小看我了
You underestimate me.

420
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,680
你们将被统统拿下
You will all be taken away

421
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,510
你们的名字将会与罪犯并列
and your name added to a list of offenders!

422
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,640
这些人并未犯下什么罪过
These people have done nothing.

423
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,950
若再敢触犯法律
Any further offense,

424
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:42,550
你们将接受公会审判
and you will all face the Sanhedrin Court!

425
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,850
那便拿了我们  羞辱我们吧
Then take us. Take our names.

426
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:46,190
你该拿的是我们
We're the ones to arrest.

427
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:49,160
不  我放你们走
No. You two can go.

428
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:52,750
平民很快就会知道与你们为伍有多危险
These people will soon learn the danger of your company.

429
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:56,320
你和你的手下
You and your men are no match

430
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,770
是无法与圣灵赋予我们的火焰相抗衡的
for the fire of the holy spirit that fills us.

431
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,140
是么
Really?

432
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:07,840
那便看看是谁火光更亮
Well, let's see whose fire burns brightest, shall we?

433
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,330
给我拿了
Take them!

434
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,670
使人民疏远那些狂热分子就是削弱他们
I've weakened these fanatics by isolating them,

435
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:38,820
让他们的支持者反戈相向
by turning their supporters against them.

436
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:42,520
你是说恐吓耶路撒冷的城民么
By terrorizing the citizens of Jerusalem.

437
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:45,320
这个问题本来也无人能解
Well, there was a problem nobody seemed able to solve.

438
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,090
但你也没解成
Neither have you.

439
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,420
他们知道若是在耶路撒冷城内
They know you'll persecute them

440
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,660
听那些布道者布道便会被你逮捕
if they listen to the preachers in Jerusalem,

441
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,890
所以他们离开耶路撒冷
so they're leaving the city

442
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,910
去听那些人的布道
to hear what they have to say.

443
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,370
你不会真以为这个扫罗
Did you really think this man Saul

444
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:16,560
会妨碍我们的使命吧
would stand in the way of our mission?

445
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,350
神殿方面是不会坐视的
The temple won't stand for this.

446
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,670
用不了多久他们定会出手阻拦
They won't let it go on much longer.

447
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,040
看来你的勇士扫罗
It looks like your hero Saul

448
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,770
对拿撒勒人追随者的营地也奈何不得
couldn't solve the problem of the Nazarene camp.

449
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:35,190
另外两名同谋呢
Where are the other two conspirators?

450
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,730
我不是来争吵的
I didn't come to bicker.

451
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:41,040
我来是请你自重一点
I came to ask you to show some dignity,

452
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,140
看清楚公会已经
to recognize that the will of the Sanhedrin

453
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,670
不再支持你了
is turning against you,

454
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:48,840
我来是想请你为了家族的利益
and ask you, for the good of this family,

455
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,710
主动让位吧
to stand down.

456
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,570
为了家族的利益吗
For the good of this family?

457
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,010
为了家族的利益
For the good of this family,

458
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:58,040
你当年做大祭司的时候
you, who in his day as High Priest

459
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,470
不懂得与罗马保持步调一致
hadn't the wits to walk in step with Rome.

460
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,320
留下了一堆烂摊子让我来收拾
You, who left a mess behind him that I had to clear up.

461
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,040
如今你却又要密谋反对我了吗
You plot against me?

462
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:10,120
如今我倒要在这里听
And now I must listen to the rantings

463
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:12,900
一个失败的刻薄老头在这里吼叫什么
of a failed and a bitter old man

464
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,190
以家族的利益为重吗
for the good of this family?

465
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:16,050
从我家滚出去
Get out of my house!

466
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,970
趁我还没有忘记你是我妻子的父亲
Before I forget you're my wife's father

467
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:20,980
并将刀插入你的胸前
and put a blade between your ribs.

468
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,970
这事我们去找彼拉多评判
We'll take this to Pilate.

469
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:51,020
你必须支持该亚法而非他的妻弟
You must favor Caiaphas over his brother-in-law.

470
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,240
我必须吗
Must I?

471
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,760
不用你教我怎么做
Don't tell me what to do.

472
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:57,410
十年的盟友
A 10-year-old alliance

473
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:00,180
不能无故抛弃
shouldn't be tossed aside without good cause.

474
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:07,560
你支持的是该亚法还是他的妻子
Is it Caiaphas you approve of or his wife?

475
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:11,410
我听说你们两个现在成好朋友了
I hear the two of you are becoming the best of friends.

476
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:40,530
弥涅耳瓦  智慧女神
Minerva, goddess of wisdom.

477
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,430
弥涅耳瓦
Minerva,

478
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,720
他们中谁应该做大祭司
which of these men shall be High Priest,

479
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:55,540
谁又应该被抛弃在沙漠中腐烂
and which one shall be left to rot in the desert?

480
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,770
没有答复
Nothing.

481
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:10,070
太令人失望了
Very disappointing.

482
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,510
有传言说
There is a rumor

483
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:18,480
您事先知道有人想密谋加害我却袖手旁观
you knew of the plot against my life and did nothing.

484
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,390
是真的吗
Is that true?

485
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,400
不  太荒唐了
No. That's ridiculous.

486
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,940
还有传言说您在我的宫殿里安插了眼线
And a rumor you have a spy here in my palace.

487
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:28,480
更有传言说您每晚都去拿撒勒人的营地
And another that you visit the Nazarene's camp each night

488
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,420
并与他们一同祷告
and pray with them.

489
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:33,870
有人建议  这一切都表明
All of which, it's been suggested,

490
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,620
您不再适任此职
makes you unfit to continue in office.

491
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,830
这些传言是真的吗
Is any of this true?

492
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:38,990
全都不是
None of it.

493
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:41,390
这些都是想要污蔑我名誉的人传播的谎言
Lies are being spread by those who wish to undermine me.

494
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:43,760
你声名扫地是因为你自己没有抓住...
You undermine yourself by failing to get a grip on --

495
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,920
够了
Enough.

496
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:51,380
我可不会把我的时间浪费在
I will not waste my time

497
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:54,230
像母亲解决孩子间的口角那样
separating truth from fiction,

498
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,210
分辨虚实上
like a mother with squabbling children.

499
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,350
当时硬币上印有罗马帝国皇帝的头像

500
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,350
让提庇留来判定吧
Tiberius shall decide.

501
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:08,840
我遇到过一个希腊人  每一个决定
I met a Greek once who made every decision

502
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,920
都靠抛硬币
with the toss of a coin.

503
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,450
皇帝的头像
Emperor's head...

504
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,990
硬币另一面是提庇留的母亲

505
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,990
还是神圣的莉薇娅
Or the divine Livia?

506
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,800
我该嘉奖你的抱负
Shall I commend you for your ambition?

507
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:25,820
还是因你传播毫无根据的谣言而谴责你
Or do I condemn you for spreading baseless rumors?

508
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,430
若是头像  我谴责你
Heads, I condemn.

509
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:32,350
若是莉薇娅  我嘉奖你
Livia, I commend.

510
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,350
是头像
Heads.

511
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,890
所以我因你那拙劣的背叛
Then I condemn you

512
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:56,560
而谴责你
for making such a poor job of your treachery.

513
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:04,710
那些渔夫和他们的追随者们
These fishermen and their followers --

514
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:05,930
处理了吗
Are they being dealt with?

515
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:08,780
处理了  都妥善彻底地处理了
They are, firmly and finally.

516
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,500
大祭司的工作并不难
Unless he wants to be loved by all,

517
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:18,660
只要他不要妄想受所有人的爱戴
the High Priest's job is not a hard one.

518
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:23,950
他必须满足罗马帝国对犹太行省的期望
He must deliver what's expected of the province of Judea by Rome

519
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,940
并压制他的子民那诸多而且通常无理的要求
and resist the many, often irrational, demands of his people.

520
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,420
厨房里的姑娘们都能做到
There are girls in the kitchen who can do that.

521
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,590
路边的野狗也能做到
Dogs in the street.

522
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,360
甚至驴都能做到
Even a donkey.

523
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:45,880
如果是头像  你留下
Heads, you stay.

524
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:47,960
如果是莉薇娅...
Livia...

525
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:51,670
我就拉一头驴子来取代你
I'll replace you with a donkey.

526
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,500
该亚法  请您把它捡起来  好吗
Get that, will you, Caiaphas?

527
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,750
是头像
Head.

528
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,280
很好
Excellent.

529
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,560
你们两个可以走了
You both may go.

530
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:21,380
我需要和你们的大祭司谈谈
I need to speak with your High Priest.

531
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,460
吸取教训吧
And the lesson is,

532
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:30,500
如果你不擅长玩弄权术  就别自取其辱
don't play politics unless you're good at it.

533
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,470
这枚硬币...
This coin...

534
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:43,070
两面都是皇帝的头像
It has two heads.

535
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:45,670
没错  是吧
It does, doesn't it?

536
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:02,640
奉依然担任大祭司的该亚法之命
By order of Caiaphas, who remains High Priest,

537
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:05,090
你们被从公会除名了
you are removed from the Sanhedrin.

538
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:09,530
即使是你的父兄
Even though it was your own father and brother

539
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:10,350
也不放过吗
who hatched this plot?

540
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:12,030
你们必须离开耶路撒冷
And you will leave Jerusalem

541
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:14,650
否则我将以叛国罪逮捕你们
or find yourself arrested for treason.

542
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:17,120
这一切
This all began

543
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:20,380
都始于对拿撒勒人  耶稣的谋害
with the murder of the Nazarene -- Jesus.

544
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,770
你们所有的干预  你们的诡计
All your interfering, your scheming.

545
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:26,160
总有一天  会让你们万劫不复
It will bring you down... eventually.

546
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,470
我试着和他们讲道理
I tried to reason with them,

547
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:44,730
但他们就是听不进去
but they just wouldn't listen.

548
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:49,020
我试图离间他们和他们的支持者
I tried to come between them and their supporters,

549
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,470
但显然他们更倾向于
but it would appear they would prefer

550
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:55,250
拿撒勒人那愚蠢的教义
the idiotic doctrine of the Nazarene.

551
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,260
我以此全权委任你去解决他们
This gives you my full authority to rid me of them.

552
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,500
彻底解决
Permanently.

553
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,980
不择手段
Do whatever is necessary.

554
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,610
不择手段
Whatever is necessary.

555
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,780
让我来告诉你们他们是些什么样的人
Let me tell you about these people.

556
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,290
这些人
These people

557
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,150
意图摧毁圣殿...
want to bring down the temple --

558
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:09,380
圣殿
The temple.

559
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,080
指引着你我人生的方向
The guiding hand in yours and my life.

560
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:20,250
是智慧的源泉
The well of wisdom.

561
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:23,230
而他们却认为没有人
And they think nobody --

562
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:25,760
没有人  可以阻挡他们
nobody -- will stand in their way.

563
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:28,900
他们藐视公会的统治
They disregard the ruling of the Sanhedrin,

564
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,400
公会宣布他们为渎神者
who call them blasphemers!

565
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:33,860
而第二天
The very next day,

566
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,710
他们中的一人却又走进圣殿
one of them walked into the temple itself

567
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:39,010
大肆宣扬他的亵渎
proclaiming his profanity.

568
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,140
尽管...
And although --

569
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,290
尽管耶路撒冷的人民
and although the people of Jerusalem

570
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:48,130
进行了审判  用石刑处死了他
delivered their justice and they stoned him to death,

571
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:52,670
他们仍继续招募那些易轻信的
they continue recruiting the gullible

572
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:56,260
还有意志不坚的人投身他们的事业
and the weak-minded to their cause.

573
00:36:56,270 --> 00:37:01,110
我们受够了吗
Do we say enough?

574
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:03,120
受够了
Enough!

575
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,960
我们应该让他们头破血流吗
Will we break their heads?

576
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:09,280
有了剑
With swords

577
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,510
有棍子  有拳头
and clubs and bare fists,

578
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:16,010
我们就可以说  "离开这片土地
we will say, "Leave this land,

579
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:18,270
否则你们就会
or you will leave this earth

580
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:21,940
躺在裹尸布中离开"
in a shroud of blood!"

581
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,950
拿上武器  穿上盔甲
Grab weapons! Grab armor!

582
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,870
跟我走
Follow me!

583
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:57,340
在场的人听好  把话传出去
Pay heed to this and spread the word.

584
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:00,700
这些人被逮捕是因为他们为假弥赛亚的信徒们
These people are being arrested for aiding, sheltering,

585
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:04,030
提供帮助  住所和食物
and feeding the followers of the false Messiah.

586
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:05,920
他们将会被...
They will be...

587
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:09,720
他们将会被囚禁
they will be imprisoned.

588
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:11,460
其他效仿者
Anyone else who does likewise

589
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,820
也会被收监关押
will also pay with their freedom.

590
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,350
不要妄想逃到沙漠里
And don't think of scurrying off to the desert

591
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:19,420
向你们的朋友们寻求帮助
for help from your friends.

592
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,480
马上就要轮到他们了
It's their turn next.

593
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,390
他来了
He's coming!

594
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:40,960
扫罗回来了
Saul's coming back!

595
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,080
他带来了军队
He's bringing men with swords.

596
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,780
只拿随身物品快跑
Take what you can!

597
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,580
快帮大家离开
Let's get everyone out of here.

598
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,480
这边  走  跟他们走
This way. Go. Go with them.

599
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,450
我们应该回加利利去
We should go back to Galilee.

600
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:07,960
不  我们必须团结在一起
No, we have to stay together.

601
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,570
我们到耶路撒冷再见
We gather again in Jerusalem.

602
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:11,110
我们得走了
We have to go now.

603
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:13,520
不  我留下
No. I'll stay.

604
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:17,990
我不会被他的威胁和恐吓所吓倒
I will not be cowed by this man and his threats.

605
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,850
我不能留你独自一人面对他
I won't leave you to face him alone.

606
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:21,320
他不是一个人
He won't be alone.

607
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,360
这是我的土地  我不会走的
This was my land. I'm staying.

608
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:26,010
我也是
And me.

609
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:28,910
迎客之道千千万
There's more than one way to welcome a visitor.

610
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:31,110
耶路撒冷再见
See you in Jerusalem.

611
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,460
赶快  快跑
Please hurry. Run.

612
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,120
小心混合
Mix it carefully.

613
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,840
太多就不起作用了
Too much and it won't work.

614
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:43,390
快走  动作快点
Go. Move faster.

615
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,360
快走  快点
Go on. Faster.

616
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,530
拉住我的手
Take my hand.

617
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,440
雅各  快走
James, go.

618
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:06,050
全部推倒
Pull it all down.

619
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,660
烧掉
Burn it.

620
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:12,080
我不想看到他们留下的任何痕迹
I want nothing left to show that they were ever here.

621
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,120
立刻
Now!

622
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,590
他再不走就来不及了
He's leaving it too late.

623
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,530
不
No.

624
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:40,180
他知道自己在干什么
He knows what he's doing.

625
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,400
抓住他
Take him!

626
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:06,670
我们看看谁的火烧得更旺
Let's see whose fire burns brightest now!

627
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,590
不
No!

628
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:20,060
不要
No!!

629
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,940
我要杀了你
I will crush you!

630
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:29,110
你有本事就来试试
You will try!

631
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:37,140
你有本事就来试试
You will try!
