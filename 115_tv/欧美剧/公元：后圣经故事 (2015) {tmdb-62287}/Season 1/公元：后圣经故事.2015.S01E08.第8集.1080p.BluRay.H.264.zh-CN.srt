1
00:00:02,495 --> 00:00:03,777
大帝在来的路上
The Emperor is coming.

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:05,811
那我们得跟他的继位者
We must avoid dishonor

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,517
搞好关系免遭羞辱
by cultivating goodwill with his successor.

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:09,573
你是指卡里古拉?
You mean Caligula?

5
00:00:09,575 --> 00:00:11,075
你要是知道我们为何来此
You may not be so keen to welcome us

6
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:12,676
可能就不会这么热烈欢迎我们了
when you find out why we're here.

7
00:00:12,678 --> 00:00:15,980
告诉我彼得在哪 我们就停手
Tell me where Peter is, and we'll stop.

8
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:18,916
我不觉得到撒玛利亚会有何益处 腓力
I don't think it will be any better in Samaria for them.

9
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:20,684
我帮你
Let me help you.

10
00:00:22,221 --> 00:00:26,090
来这途中 我看见四只秃鹰
On the journey here, I saw four vultures.

11
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:28,726
这地方让你见到幻象
This place gives you visions.

12
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:30,827
西门魔法师!
Simon the sorcerer!

13
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:35,766
他觉得自己比我厉害
He thinks he can do what I can't.

14
00:00:35,768 --> 00:00:39,370
奉耶稣之名 我将你从监牢中释放
In the name of Jesus, I release you from your prison.

15
00:00:41,874 --> 00:00:43,207
你是否悔改你的罪?
Do you repent your sins?

16
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,209
我悔改
I do.

17
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,609
把彼得的消息告诉扫罗
Tell Saul about Peter.

18
00:00:45,611 --> 00:00:47,378
- 他往北去了  - 哪里?
- He headed north.  - Where?

19
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,113
大马士革
Damascus.

not before Tiberius has left for Rome.

34
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:14,872
那我要如何确保?
And how exactly do I do that?

35
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:16,507
你同他一起去
You're going with him.

36
00:01:22,548 --> 00:01:25,683
我可不认为年轻活泼就该是这副模样
I won't defend this as youthful high spirits.

37
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:28,952
恕我冒昧... 我也很不想这样说...
Forgive me... and it pains me to say this...

38
00:01:28,954 --> 00:01:31,722
这可不是未来君主应有的行为
This is not the behavior of a future emperor.

39
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:33,590
没错
I agree.

40
00:01:33,592 --> 00:01:35,859
要能承担起将来的责任
Caligula has a great deal to learn

41
00:01:35,861 --> 00:01:38,829
卡里古拉要学的东西还很多
about the responsibilities he will carry.

42
00:01:38,831 --> 00:01:41,331
但他同这个犹太人阿格里帕整日厮混
But it doesn't help that he spends so much time

43
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:43,300
可毫无益处
with this Jew, Agrippa.

44
00:01:43,302 --> 00:01:45,502
近墨者黑
He's a malign influence.

45
00:01:45,504 --> 00:01:48,739
叫醒他们 让他们出去
Wake them. Get them out of here.

46
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:50,507
可不能让克劳迪娅看见
Claudia mustn't see this.

47
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:53,043
不能让克劳迪娅看见什么?
Claudia mustn't see what?

48
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:08,692
他们怎敢把我的名字写在烂醉的妓女身上
How dare they scrawl my name on a wine-soaked whore.

49
00:02:08,694 --> 00:02:12,063
要是这淫行在屋里留下一丝痕迹
I will not set foot inside this room again

50
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:15,332
我便再不踏足半步
until every sign of this debauchery is gone.

51
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,411
要是能在日落前赶到拉马塔教区
If we reach Ramatha before sunset,

52
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:29,680
应该就能在两日内到达大马士革
we should make Damascus in two days.

53
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:31,248
扫罗 那里远在70英里外
Saul, that's over 70 Miles away,

54
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,816
你难道想一日内赶到?
and you want to do that in a day,

55
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:34,985
这一路都是荒漠和山路
over open deserts and Mountain tracks

56
00:02:34,987 --> 00:02:36,220
还是三伏天呢
in the hottest month?

57
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:38,055
看起来我们新来的人
It would appear our new recruit

58
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:39,990
更想窝在家里呢
would be happier staying at home.

59
00:02:41,393 --> 00:02:44,728
我可不要走这么快 会要了命的
I'm not going to kill myself marching at that pace.

60
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:52,870
听说腓力需要我们
We get word that Philip needs us.

61
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:55,706
必须有人去撒玛利亚
Somebody has to go to Samaria.

62
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,374
那我们怎么办?
So what do we do?

63
00:02:57,376 --> 00:02:59,743
就躲在一个地窖里
We hide in a cellar.

64
00:03:11,924 --> 00:03:13,257
西门 我明白你的心情
Simon, I feel the same way.

65
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:15,392
但只要扫罗一日在那...
But as long as Saul's out there...

66
00:03:15,394 --> 00:03:17,728
我知道跟腓力会合很危险
I know going to join Philip is dangerous,

67
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,596
但我不想当个懦夫
but I feel like a coward.

68
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:21,965
那么现在你不必当懦夫了
Well, now you don't need to.

69
00:03:21,967 --> 00:03:23,734
扫罗走了
Saul's gone.

70
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:26,804
他离开了耶路撒冷
He's left Jerusalem.

71
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:30,207
约翰 我们今夜就赶去撒玛利亚
We'll go to Samaria tonight, John.

72
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,288
玛利亚? 是我... 约亚拿
Mary? It's me... Joanna.

73
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,089
你在这里做什么?
What are you doing here?

74
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:47,825
我是随安提帕的家宰来的
I'm here with the house of Antipas,

75
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:49,193
来服侍希罗底
maid-servant to Herodias.

76
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:51,528
你是在宫殿里作工吗?
Are you working in the palace?

77
00:03:56,902 --> 00:03:59,770
我们得小心 这里的人与我们信仰不同
We must be cautious. None here share our faith.

78
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,006
彼得也在这里吗?
Is Peter here, too?

79
00:04:03,008 --> 00:04:06,443
他在城里... 安全躲着呢
He's in the city... hiding, safe.

80
00:04:07,913 --> 00:04:11,715
自从耶稣治好我俩的病 我就整日想着你
I thought about you every day since Jesus cured us.

81
00:04:11,717 --> 00:04:14,518
我也想遵行他讲的道 但是...
I have tried to follow his word, but...

82
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:18,322
我听说他已经死了
I heard he was dead.

83
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,795
约亚拿...
Joanna...

84
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:26,396
耶稣并没死
Jesus isn't dead.

85
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,967
在他上十字架前
Before they crucified him,

86
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:33,103
他就告诉我们他将在三日后复活
he told us he would rise after three days,

87
00:04:33,105 --> 00:04:36,073
后来果真如此
and he did.

88
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:37,875
他活得好好的
He's very much alive.

89
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,443
是真的
No. It's true.

90
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,144
他先来找我
He came to me first.

91
00:04:41,146 --> 00:04:43,313
我与他同坐 与他同吃
I've sat with him, eaten with him.

92
00:04:43,315 --> 00:04:46,450
他真如他所说
He is who he said he was.

93
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:49,686
是弥赛亚
He is the Messiah.

94
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:13,510
我一度还挺喜欢阿格里帕 但是如今...
I was fond of Agrippa once, but now...

95
00:05:16,782 --> 00:05:19,049
我该处死他吗?
Should I have him killed?

96
00:05:23,622 --> 00:05:25,956
不用
No.

97
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,158
您带卡里古拉回罗马
Take Caligula back to Rome with you,

98
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,061
由我丈夫来处置阿格里帕
and my husband will deal with Agrippa.

99
00:05:31,997 --> 00:05:33,397
彼拉多是个好巡抚
Pilate is a good governor.

100
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,865
您只要看看
You only have to see

101
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:37,401
耶路撒冷清静无事的街道就知道他...
the trouble-free streets of Jerusalem to see what...

102
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:40,737
为了让你丈夫升官你真是煞费苦心
You work hard to promote your husband.

103
00:05:42,374 --> 00:05:45,742
等我把他升迁到罗马去的时候
I'm sure he will benefit from your wisdom

104
00:05:45,744 --> 00:05:49,112
你的智慧一定对他大有裨益
when I promote him to a position in Rome.

105
00:05:55,654 --> 00:05:57,721
谢谢您
Thank you.

106
00:05:59,491 --> 00:06:02,726
我不知道我更高兴的是哪件事...
I don't know what pleases me more...

107
00:06:02,728 --> 00:06:06,163
是可以去罗马多陪陪您
the thought of spending more time in your company in Rome

108
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:08,632
还是终于可以...
or finally being able to...

109
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:18,542
有什么问题吗?
Is there something wrong?

110
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,143
没有
No.

111
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,248
感觉有点凉 没什么
Just a chill. That's all.

112
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,584
不要低估了彼得
Do not underestimate Peter.

113
00:06:27,586 --> 00:06:31,121
他是个卖狗皮膏药的 但是非常在行
He is a snake-oil trader, but a good one.

114
00:06:31,123 --> 00:06:36,126
他先告诉大家他们有麻烦了...
First, he tells the people that they have a problem...

115
00:06:36,128 --> 00:06:40,263
说他们杀了神派给他们的人
that they killed the man sent to them by God.

116
00:06:40,265 --> 00:06:44,134
然后他再说他有解决方法
Then he tells them that he has the answer.

117
00:06:44,136 --> 00:06:45,969
他们只需要
All they have to do

118
00:06:45,971 --> 00:06:48,805
忏悔 然后跳到河里去就可以了
is repent and throw themselves in the river.

119
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,776
他就不能消停会吗?
Does he ever stop?

120
00:06:52,778 --> 00:06:55,479
我从来没见过为了毁灭敌人
I never saw a man with so much energy

121
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:58,081
如此干劲十足的人
for the destruction of his enemies.

122
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:03,520
我们现在... 坐在这里... 作为被选中的少数人
And here we sit... now... the chosen few,

123
00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:07,357
我们的使命是根除这个异教
whose work it is to stamp out this heresy

124
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:10,527
不能让它从耶路撒冷
before it spreads from Jerusalem

125
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:15,132
散布到叙利亚 吕大 以马忤斯 甚至是马察达去
and takes control of Syria, Lydda, Emmaus, and even Masada,

126
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:19,569
不能让彼得这个渔夫把他那虚假的解药
before Peter the fisherman can sell the whole world

127
00:07:19,571 --> 00:07:22,039
卖给全世界
his fake cure.

128
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:40,810
这里大多数人都认为罗马人很堕落
Most people here believe all Romans to be degenerate.

129
00:07:44,582 --> 00:07:47,083
你想证明他们是对的吗?
Are you determined to prove them right?

130
00:07:47,085 --> 00:07:48,951
你听到什么了吗?
Do you hear something?

131
00:07:48,953 --> 00:07:51,521
噪音...
A noise...

132
00:07:51,523 --> 00:07:53,690
就像母牛在叫
like a cow breaking wind.

133
00:07:55,026 --> 00:07:57,327
最糟的是 你侮辱了我的妻子
On top of that, you insult my wife.

134
00:07:57,329 --> 00:08:01,631
如果一个人的妻子是婊子的女儿
Is it possible to insult a man's wife

135
00:08:01,633 --> 00:08:03,766
还怎么侮辱她呢?
when she's the daughter of a whore?

136
00:08:07,505 --> 00:08:13,376
收回那些话 不然我就割了你的喉咙
Take back those words before I open your throat.

137
00:08:13,378 --> 00:08:14,977
来啊
Do it.

138
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:17,579
我想着提庇留会怎么对付你
I'd almost die happy

139
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:19,882
会死得很开心的
thinking about what Tiberius would do to you.

140
00:09:04,963 --> 00:09:07,597
起来啊 你这头蠢马!
Get up, you stupid animal!

141
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,845
走啊
Come on.

142
00:09:24,315 --> 00:09:26,916
我本该下手的
I should've done it.

143
00:09:26,918 --> 00:09:29,419
他说了这种话我就该割了他的喉咙
I should've slit his throat after what he said.

144
00:09:29,421 --> 00:09:31,821
要是你杀了他 你还能活多久?
And how long would you have lived if you had?

145
00:09:31,823 --> 00:09:34,657
然后把阿格里帕也杀了
And done the same with Agrippa.

146
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:36,492
你也可以忽视他们
Or your could ignore them both

147
00:09:36,494 --> 00:09:39,562
期待一下罗马的生活
and look forward to life in Rome.

148
00:09:39,564 --> 00:09:43,800
我还从来没见过如此居心叵测 卑鄙狠毒
I've never come across such treacherous, poisonous,

149
00:09:43,802 --> 00:09:46,002
渴望权力的阴谋家
power-hungry schemers.

150
00:09:47,472 --> 00:09:49,338
怎么了?
What is it?

151
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,240
我希望那里的一切
I'm looking forward to everything there

152
00:09:51,242 --> 00:09:53,276
都能少点...
being a lot less...

153
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:54,310
犹太风格
Jewish.

154
00:09:54,312 --> 00:09:55,445
你呢?
Aren't you?

155
00:09:55,447 --> 00:09:58,481
你在说什么 克劳迪娅?
What are you talking about, Claudia?

156
00:09:58,483 --> 00:10:03,152
提庇留要升你去罗马了
Tiberius has offered you a position in Rome.

157
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:08,291
终于
At last.

158
00:10:09,727 --> 00:10:13,963
我们终于可以离开这地方了
We can finally leave this place.

159
00:10:13,965 --> 00:10:16,232
我们只需要
All we have to do

160
00:10:16,234 --> 00:10:17,733
做好我们的事
is play our part

161
00:10:17,735 --> 00:10:21,137
让阿格里帕和卡里古拉分开
in keeping Agrippa and Caligula away from each other.

162
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,575
我奉圣父 圣子
I baptize you in the name of the father

163
00:10:25,577 --> 00:10:28,344
和圣灵的名为你施洗
and of the son and of the Holy Spirit.

164
00:10:33,084 --> 00:10:35,885
彼得! 约翰!
Peter! John!

165
00:10:41,092 --> 00:10:44,126
见到你们真高兴
It's so good to see you both.

166
00:10:44,128 --> 00:10:48,030
朋友们 如今我们将自己交托给耶稣
My friends, today, we commit ourselves to Jesus,

167
00:10:48,032 --> 00:10:51,133
而这两个人认识他
who these two men knew

168
00:10:51,135 --> 00:10:54,437
并从他那里得到了圣灵的能力
and from him received the power of the Holy Spirit.

169
00:10:56,574 --> 00:10:58,641
如果连弥赛亚的名字也不敢说
How can we celebrate the Messiah

170
00:10:58,643 --> 00:11:01,143
还如何颂扬他?
when we dare not say his name?

171
00:11:01,145 --> 00:11:02,278
我害怕
I'm scared.

172
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,447
不必害怕
Don't be.

173
00:11:04,449 --> 00:11:07,149
我们共同祈祷 你的信仰便可给你力量
Your faith will bring you strength when we pray together.

174
00:11:09,354 --> 00:11:11,220
苦撒
Chuza.

175
00:11:11,222 --> 00:11:13,189
我没想到你会现在回来
I wasn't expecting you back.

176
00:11:13,191 --> 00:11:15,758
这是我的丈夫
This is my husband.

177
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,159
那这位是谁?
And who is this?

178
00:11:17,161 --> 00:11:18,661
玛利亚
Mary.

179
00:11:18,663 --> 00:11:21,430
我才刚刚开始在这个宫殿工作
I only just started work here in the palace,

180
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:22,665
但我认识约亚拿...
but I know Joanna from...

181
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:24,567
集市上认识的
From the market.

182
00:11:24,569 --> 00:11:26,569
我们以前常在集市上碰到
We used to see each other at the market.

183
00:11:26,571 --> 00:11:28,104
我们不是说好了
Didn't we agree

184
00:11:28,106 --> 00:11:30,873
只要交了新朋友都要告诉我吗?
you need to tell me about any new friends?

185
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:37,313
我夫人最近受了一些不好的影响
My wife has come under some bad influences recently.

186
00:11:37,315 --> 00:11:39,749
我不想再发生这种事
I don't want it to happen again.

187
00:11:39,751 --> 00:11:42,518
不要担心 我会保护她的
Don't worry. I'll keep her from harm.

188
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,426
你的丈夫不知道你的信仰吗?
Your husband doesn't know about your faith?

189
00:11:50,428 --> 00:11:51,827
他知道的
He does.

190
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:55,264
安全起见 我同意保密
I agreed to hide it to protect us both.

191
00:11:55,266 --> 00:11:56,699
安提帕和希罗底
It was Antipas and Herodias

192
00:11:56,701 --> 00:11:58,467
把施洗者约翰的头砍了
that had John the baptist beheaded.

193
00:11:58,469 --> 00:12:01,103
我们伺候的就是这样无情的人
These are ruthless people we work for.

194
00:12:01,105 --> 00:12:02,672
你觉得他会把你供出来吗?
Do you think he'd give you away?

195
00:12:02,674 --> 00:12:03,973
不 他不会那么做的
No. He wouldn't do that.

196
00:12:05,543 --> 00:12:06,842
哦
Ooh.

197
00:12:06,844 --> 00:12:09,878
我们又弄脏了一个女仆
We've soiled another serving girl.

198
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,649
哦
Oh.

199
00:12:13,651 --> 00:12:15,384
干嘛这么严肃?
Why so serious?

200
00:12:15,386 --> 00:12:18,154
只是开个玩笑
It's just a bit of fun.

201
00:12:23,628 --> 00:12:26,062
我们离这死气沉沉的地方远一点
Let's get out of this mausoleum

202
00:12:26,064 --> 00:12:27,863
去找些合适的女人
and find some proper women.

203
00:12:27,865 --> 00:12:30,733
你也太挑剔了
You're far too choosy.

204
00:12:30,735 --> 00:12:34,170
成熟的果实就在眼前 我的朋友却视而不见
My friend doesn't know ripe fruit when he sees it.

205
00:12:34,172 --> 00:12:35,438
请原谅 我们得...
Forgive us. We need...

206
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,839
你可以下去了
You can leave us.

207
00:12:38,443 --> 00:12:41,577
你是聋了还是太蠢?
Are you deaf or just stupid?

208
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:43,212
走开
Leave us.

209
00:12:51,155 --> 00:12:54,789
我还要为你姐姐希罗底做事
I... I have work to do for your sister, Herodias.

210
00:12:56,661 --> 00:13:00,096
她不会介意你和我共度片刻
She won't mind if you spend a few minutes with me.

211
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:04,533
我亲爱的弟弟
My dear brother.

212
00:13:08,673 --> 00:13:10,940
我早同你讲过...
I've told you before...

213
00:13:10,942 --> 00:13:14,543
别让我逮到你玩弄我的东西
don't let me catch you playing with my things.

214
00:13:31,663 --> 00:13:32,728
扫罗
Saul.

215
00:13:34,298 --> 00:13:35,364
扫罗!
Saul!

216
00:13:37,468 --> 00:13:40,703
扫罗 这地方太疯狂了
Saul, this place is madness.

217
00:13:40,705 --> 00:13:42,571
要是你没找到他呢?
What if you don't find him?

218
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:44,707
要是彼得根本不在大马士革呢?
What if Peter's not even in Damascus?

219
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:46,575
我们要追到安提阿吗?
Do we march onto Antioch?

220
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:50,513
你究竟来这里干嘛? 嗯?
Why are you even here? Huh?

221
00:13:50,515 --> 00:13:52,715
我来这里是因为受命来此
I'm here because I was ordered to be here

222
00:13:52,717 --> 00:13:54,850
我们听命于同一人
by the same man we both answer to.

223
00:13:54,852 --> 00:13:57,219
那你就该协助完成这一使命
Then you should be helping this mission,

224
00:13:57,221 --> 00:13:59,355
而非拖拉时间
not slowing it down.

225
00:14:00,692 --> 00:14:02,591
你为什么这么恨彼得?
Why do you hate Peter so much?

226
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:05,094
因为他的话太荒谬
Because his claims are ridiculous.

227
00:14:05,096 --> 00:14:07,697
因为说他是神拣选的
Because the idea that God would use him

228
00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:08,998
神的旨意的器皿
as an instrument of his will

229
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,933
让他传扬新的弥赛亚的道
to spread the word of a new Messiah

230
00:14:10,935 --> 00:14:13,736
这想法... 太荒谬了
is... is ridiculous.

231
00:14:13,738 --> 00:14:17,440
人们怎能相信造物主会选择
How can people believe that the creator would choose

232
00:14:17,442 --> 00:14:20,509
一个卑微的渔夫来表达他的旨意?
a simple fisherman to articulate his message?

233
00:14:20,511 --> 00:14:23,112
不 不
No. No.

234
00:14:23,114 --> 00:14:24,847
他会选择一个
He would choose a man

235
00:14:24,849 --> 00:14:27,550
比渔村之徒眼界开阔的人
who knew a world outside of a fishing village,

236
00:14:27,552 --> 00:14:30,453
而不是替骗子耶稣散播谎言的人
not a man who spreads lies about an impostor Jesus,

237
00:14:30,455 --> 00:14:34,890
会选一个为他的旨意
but a man who can add beauty and power and truth

238
00:14:34,892 --> 00:14:36,892
增光添彩的人... 比如...
to his message... a man like...

239
00:14:44,702 --> 00:14:46,168
好吧
Yeah.

240
00:15:03,254 --> 00:15:04,887
扫罗
Saul.

241
00:15:08,793 --> 00:15:10,893
扫罗
Saul.

242
00:15:10,895 --> 00:15:12,928
你为什么逼迫我?
Why do you persecute me?

243
00:15:16,968 --> 00:15:18,367
你是谁?
Who are you?

244
00:15:18,369 --> 00:15:21,437
我就是
I am Jesus.

245
00:15:21,439 --> 00:15:23,038
你所逼迫的耶稣
Whom you persecute.

246
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:26,575
不
No.

247
00:15:30,648 --> 00:15:32,982
不
No.

248
00:15:32,984 --> 00:15:34,850
不 不! 不!
No. No! No!

249
00:15:42,927 --> 00:15:46,195
你要我... 你要我怎样?
What do you... What do you want from me?

250
00:15:48,032 --> 00:15:50,466
你要我怎样?
What do you want from me?

251
00:15:52,203 --> 00:15:54,637
你要我怎样?!
What do you want from me?!

252
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:57,873
去大马士革
Go into Damascus.

253
00:15:59,443 --> 00:16:02,077
你所当作的事 必有人告诉你
You'll be told what to do.

254
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:18,060
帮帮我
Help me.

255
00:16:20,932 --> 00:16:23,365
帮帮我
Help me.

256
00:16:23,367 --> 00:16:26,068
来人啊!
Someone!

257
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:28,204
帮帮我!
Help me!

258
00:16:28,206 --> 00:16:29,939
救我!!
Help me!!

259
00:16:33,888 --> 00:16:38,258
大马士革

260
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:53,203
扫罗...
Saul...

261
00:16:53,205 --> 00:16:55,639
你得吃点东西
You have to eat something.

262
00:17:13,692 --> 00:17:15,792
我知道你们有些人想回到家人身边
I know some of you want to be back with your families,

263
00:17:15,794 --> 00:17:17,761
我也知道大马士革满是外邦人
and I know Damascus is full of foreigners

264
00:17:17,763 --> 00:17:19,162
食物也太贵
and the food is overpriced.

265
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:22,799
但我们和扫罗一同来此 目的明确
But we came here with Saul, and we know why we're here.

266
00:17:22,801 --> 00:17:25,168
带我们来此的是个了不起的人
The man who brought us is a remarkable man.

267
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:28,171
不管在沙漠中发生什么事 我们都不能放弃
Whatever happened to him in the desert, we can't give up.

268
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:30,440
我们必须找到彼得和追随他的人
We must find Peter and his followers.

269
00:17:33,346 --> 00:17:36,480
{\an8}撒玛利亚

270
00:17:34,646 --> 00:17:36,480
我自欺欺人
I was deluded.

271
00:17:36,482 --> 00:17:39,049
用雕虫小技骗倒众人后
I was deceiving people with my cheap trickery,

272
00:17:39,051 --> 00:17:44,121
我开始相信我真有自己宣称的能力
and I started to believe my own claims of greatness.

273
00:17:44,123 --> 00:17:48,158
然后腓利 他来到了撒玛利亚
And then Philip, he came to Samaria.

274
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,759
他向我指明道路
He showed me the true path.

275
00:17:49,761 --> 00:17:55,565
他说起了耶稣 我就相信了他
He started talking about Jesus, and I believed.

276
00:17:55,567 --> 00:17:57,601
我受了洗礼
I was baptized.

277
00:18:02,908 --> 00:18:06,143
在耶路撒冷我们不受神殿所爱
We are not loved by the temple in Jerusalem,

278
00:18:06,145 --> 00:18:07,644
你也一样
and neither are you.

279
00:18:07,646 --> 00:18:11,281
好吧... 我们应该一起传扬耶稣的道
Well... well, together, we shall help to spread the word

280
00:18:11,283 --> 00:18:13,783
传扬他的能力 好吗?
and the power of Jesus, eh?

281
00:18:24,263 --> 00:18:26,830
他们已经听说了你在耶路撒冷
They, uh, they've heard all about the miracles

282
00:18:26,832 --> 00:18:30,000
施行的奇迹
you performed in Jerusalem.

283
00:18:30,002 --> 00:18:32,035
他们希望在撒玛利亚能有更多奇迹
They hope to see more here in Samaria.

284
00:18:48,987 --> 00:18:50,754
我的孩子快生下来了 巴拿巴
My child is coming, Barnabas.

285
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:52,556
我得离开大马士革
I have to leave Damascus.

286
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:53,558
什么?
What?

287
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:54,858
我刚才看到了流便
I just saw Reuben,

288
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,127
大祭司该亚法的得力手下
the right-hand man to high priest Caiaphas,

289
00:18:57,129 --> 00:18:58,795
还有亚设 扫罗的手下
and Asher, one of Saul's men.

290
00:19:00,032 --> 00:19:02,165
扫罗在大马士革
Saul is in Damascus.

291
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:05,101
你来到这里给我们灌输
You arrive here and you fill our heads

292
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:07,103
救主耶稣基督的力量
with the power of Jesus Christ the savior,
283 

293
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:09,239
却一见危险就要退缩
and now you cower at the first sign of danger.

294
00:19:09,241 --> 00:19:10,241
亚拿尼亚!
Ananias!

295
00:19:10,242 --> 00:19:12,409
大数人扫罗 他想杀了我...
Saul of Tarsus, who wants me dead...

296
00:19:12,411 --> 00:19:14,444
想杀了我们所有人... 他在这里
who wants us all dead... is here.

297
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:16,213
那我该怎么做?
And what am I supposed to do?

298
00:19:16,215 --> 00:19:18,148
告诉我妻子 先不要生孩子了
Tell my wife, don't have our child yet.

299
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,983
赶紧离开这里?
We have to leave the city?

300
00:19:19,985 --> 00:19:21,251
留下吧
Stay.

301
00:19:22,921 --> 00:19:25,055
留下来
Stay.

302
00:19:25,057 --> 00:19:27,090
我们共同寻求力量
And we'll find strength together.

303
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,594
倚靠耶稣
Trust in Jesus.

304
00:19:33,098 --> 00:19:36,833
让圣灵进入你困苦的肢体
Let the Holy Spirit into your troubled limbs.

305
00:19:36,835 --> 00:19:39,769
他赐给你永生
He brings you eternal life.

306
00:19:49,748 --> 00:19:52,782
你当信服耶稣基督
Have faith in Jesus Christ.

307
00:19:52,784 --> 00:19:56,620
他便是那路 是真理 是生命
He is the way, the truth, and the life.

308
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:01,591
我们祈祷新的信徒
We pray that all our new believers

309
00:20:01,593 --> 00:20:04,327
都蒙受圣灵
receive the Holy Spirit.

310
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:05,996
难以置信
Unbelievable.

311
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:14,271
我们向神悔改 信靠我主 蒙他悦纳
We enter God's kingdom by repentance and faith
302 

312
00:20:14,273 --> 00:20:17,173
进入神的国
by accepting him in our lives.

313
00:20:34,626 --> 00:20:36,960
等你回到罗马...
When you return to Rome...

314
00:20:38,263 --> 00:20:41,131
根据这份文件 你会被考虑
this document says you'll be considered

315
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:44,200
任职掌管国库
for the position of praetor to the treasury.

316
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:45,669
被考虑?
Considered?

317
00:20:45,671 --> 00:20:49,172
我的印章保证你会出任
And my seal on it says you will get the job.

318
00:20:49,174 --> 00:20:52,542
凯撒 我不知该如何表达谢意
Caesar, I don't know how to show you my gratitude.

319
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:54,144
那就勤勉工作吧
By doing the job well.

320
00:20:55,314 --> 00:20:59,249
还有 永远听从你妻子的建议
And by always listening to your wife's advice.

321
00:21:03,855 --> 00:21:06,790
这下好了 这是正式命令
There. It's official.

322
00:21:06,792 --> 00:21:08,858
永远听从你的妻子
Always listen to your wife.

323
00:21:12,297 --> 00:21:13,997
我会记住的!
I won't forget this!

324
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:15,565
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

325
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:17,934
你就这么懦弱只敢在背后阴我们?
Are you such a coward you have to go behind our backs?

326
00:21:17,936 --> 00:21:19,436
又喝酒了 是吗?
Been drinking again, have we?

327
00:21:19,438 --> 00:21:22,639
提庇留坚持让我和他一起去罗马
Tiberius is insisting I go with him to Rome

328
00:21:22,641 --> 00:21:24,507
让阿格里帕留在这里
and Agrippa stays here.

329
00:21:24,509 --> 00:21:28,978
我知道这是你们密谋的结果
I know it is a result of your plotting.

330
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:32,082
相信我... 当我看不到你的时候
Believe me... when I'm not in your presence,

331
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:33,983
我从来没有想到过你
I don't give you a moment's thought.

332
00:21:36,955 --> 00:21:41,624
他以为他能拆散我们
He thinks he can break the bond between us.

333
00:21:41,626 --> 00:21:43,493
但是他错了
But he is wrong.

334
00:21:43,495 --> 00:21:47,097
如果你觉得提庇留总是能护着你
Now, you make a very grave mistake

335
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:50,033
那你就犯了一个非常严重的错误
if you think Tiberius will always protect you.

336
00:22:52,564 --> 00:22:56,566
彼拉多 你会为你的阴谋付出代价的!
Pilate, you will pay for your scheming!

337
00:22:56,568 --> 00:22:58,201
你将俯首听命!
And you will answer to me!

338
00:22:58,203 --> 00:22:59,536
你将俯首听命!
You will answer to me!

339
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:11,664
彼得
Peter.

340
00:23:14,802 --> 00:23:16,935
这... 这是我所有身家
This... this is everything that I own.

341
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,637
我希望你可以用它
I want you to use it

342
00:23:18,639 --> 00:23:21,006
帮助传扬耶稣的道
to help spread the word of Jesus.

343
00:23:23,144 --> 00:23:25,544
我想要的回报仅仅是...
Now, all I want in return is just...

344
00:23:25,546 --> 00:23:28,914
你知道的 仅仅是一些圣灵的能力...
you know, just a few drops of the Holy Spirit...

345
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:30,716
作为朋友
as a friend.

346
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:36,088
作为同伴 耶稣的追随者
as a fellow Jesus follower.

347
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:37,122
怎么样?
Yeah?

348
00:23:48,502 --> 00:23:50,202
你以为神是可以用钱买的?
You think God can be bought?

349
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,181
你觉得这只是魔法?!
You think this is just magic?!

350
00:24:02,183 --> 00:24:03,916
彼得! 住手!
Peter! Stop!

351
00:24:03,918 --> 00:24:06,185
不要发怒!
Hold your anger!

352
00:24:06,187 --> 00:24:08,787
嘿! 收回你说的话!
Hey! Take back your words!

353
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:10,289
忏悔!
Repent!

354
00:24:11,859 --> 00:24:15,661
要是你还看重性命就快点忏悔!
If you value your life, repent now!

355
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:24,002
我忏悔!
I repent!

356
00:24:32,213 --> 00:24:34,046
求求你 主!
Please, Lord!

357
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:38,584
求你怜恤此人!
Show mercy to this man!

358
00:24:40,121 --> 00:24:43,489
我恳求你!
I beg you!

359
00:24:43,491 --> 00:24:45,624
饶他一命!
Let him live!

360
00:25:03,944 --> 00:25:05,177
彼得
Peter.

361
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,628
倘若这不是你的道
If it isn't your word,

362
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:25,130
不是你为你的仆人所谋之事
isn't a part of your plan for your servants.

363
00:25:25,132 --> 00:25:26,532
但正如你照看我们
But as you watch over us,

364
00:25:26,534 --> 00:25:30,436
我祈求你帮助我丈夫体谅之
I pray that you help my husband understand.

365
00:25:30,438 --> 00:25:33,872
他是一个好人
He's a good man.

366
00:25:33,874 --> 00:25:36,809
我奉你儿子耶稣的名祈祷...
I pray in the name of your son, Jesus...

367
00:25:39,113 --> 00:25:44,516
他为救我们而死
who died that we might be saved.

368
00:25:44,518 --> 00:25:49,855
若你喜悦 让苏撒拿发现耶稣的智慧
If it pleases you, let Chuza discover the wisdom of Jesus.

369
00:25:49,857 --> 00:25:52,424
如若不喜 我恳求...
If it does not, I ask very...

370
00:26:21,755 --> 00:26:23,655
克劳迪娅
Claudia.

371
00:26:23,657 --> 00:26:25,757
克劳迪娅
Claudia.

372
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:28,760
不管梦到什么 不过是梦而已
Whatever it was, it was just a dream.

373
00:26:30,764 --> 00:26:31,997
怎么了?
What is it?

374
00:26:31,999 --> 00:26:34,766
什么东西这么可怕?
What was so terrible?

375
00:26:34,768 --> 00:26:37,002
没什么
It's nothing.

376
00:26:45,513 --> 00:26:48,313
亚拿尼亚
Ananias.

377
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:16,308
亚拿尼亚
Ananias.

378
00:27:17,945 --> 00:27:20,078
主
Lord.

379
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,147
往直街去
Go to the street called straight.

380
00:27:22,149 --> 00:27:26,084
找一个大数人
Ask for a man from Tarsus.

381
00:27:26,086 --> 00:27:28,020
名叫扫罗
His name is Saul.

382
00:27:30,391 --> 00:27:33,458
但我知道这人怎样在耶路撒冷多多苦害
But I know the harm that this man has done

383
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,859
你的圣徒
to your people in Jerusalem.

384
00:27:34,961 --> 00:27:37,496
他是我所拣选的器皿
He is my chosen instrument.

385
00:27:37,498 --> 00:27:41,066
要在外邦人和君王并以色列人面前
He will proclaim my name to the gentiles and their kings

386
00:27:41,068 --> 00:27:44,036
宣扬我的名
and the people of Israel.

387
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:52,844
什么?
What?

388
00:27:52,846 --> 00:27:56,214
住手 伙计! 你不能!
Stop, mate! You mustn't!

389
00:27:57,518 --> 00:27:58,784
亚拿尼亚
Ananias.

390
00:28:06,382 --> 00:28:07,971
得有人回耶路撒冷
Someone needs to go to Jerusalem

391
00:28:07,973 --> 00:28:09,172
把这发生的事告诉该亚法
and tell Caiaphas what's happening.

392
00:28:09,174 --> 00:28:10,340
该告诉他什么呢?
And tell him what, exactly?

393
00:28:10,342 --> 00:28:12,842
让他知道他的红人 阻止亵渎神灵之人
That his golden boy, his great weapon

394
00:28:12,844 --> 00:28:14,647
东山再起的得力干将

395
00:28:14,662 --> 00:28:15,795
正在黑暗中
is sitting in the dark

396
00:28:15,797 --> 00:28:18,397
把自己饿死?
starving himself to death?

397
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,132
或许我能帮忙
Perhaps I can help.

398
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:26,138
我有消息要给大数人扫罗...
I have a message for Saul of Tarsus...

399
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,740
很重要的消息
an important one.

400
00:28:27,742 --> 00:28:29,175
来自何人?
From whom?

401
00:28:29,177 --> 00:28:32,578
来自... 某个对他很了解的人...
From... someone who knows him well...

402
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,680
可以说 比任何人都了解他

403
00:28:36,184 --> 00:28:37,316
那么你是...?
And you are...?

404
00:28:37,318 --> 00:28:39,352

亚拿尼亚在哪儿? 在这里吗?
Where's Ananias? Is he here?

407
00:28:52,734 --> 00:28:54,734
- 我在这  - 哦 哦

408
00:28:54,736 --> 00:28:57,436
求你... 救救我
Save me from this... please.

409
00:29:06,147 --> 00:29:08,614
他拣选了你 叫你明白他的旨意
He has chosen you to know his will

410
00:29:08,616 --> 00:29:11,450
又得见那义者
and to see the righteous one

411
00:29:11,452 --> 00:29:15,454
听他口中所出的声音
and to hear the words from his mouth.

412
00:29:38,446 --> 00:29:41,781
他能看见了
He can see.

413
00:29:41,783 --> 00:29:42,915
扫罗又能看见了

谢谢你 谢谢你 谢谢你 
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

416
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:58,964
把我和卡里古拉分开又把我困在此处
Separate me from Caligula and keep me in this place,

417
00:29:58,966 --> 00:30:01,000
至少也该尊重我
but at least show me some respect.

418
00:30:01,002 --> 00:30:03,803
照我所说惩罚这些亵渎神灵的人
Do as I ask and punish these blasphemers.

419
00:30:03,805 --> 00:30:06,572
这是你的职责 你要做出表率
It's your duty. Make an example of them.

420
00:30:06,574 --> 00:30:09,508
职责? 什么时候你开始知道职责了?
Duty? Since when have you had any thoughts of duty?

421
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:13,479
他是对的... 尽管我质疑他的动机
He's right... though I do question his reasons.

422
00:30:13,481 --> 00:30:16,749
他对这个女人有兴趣
He has an interest in this woman.

423
00:30:28,229 --> 00:30:30,729
苦撒 我的家宰
Chuza, as my chief Steward,

424
00:30:30,731 --> 00:30:32,798
你知道背叛的后果
you know the consequences of betrayal.

425
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,400
果真如此吗?
Is it true?

426
00:30:35,536 --> 00:30:38,737
你的妻子是那个人称耶稣的拿撒勒人的信徒吗?
Is your wife a follower of the Nazarene they call Jesus?

427
00:30:38,739 --> 00:30:41,740
我听见你向他祷告
I heard you pray to him.

428
00:30:41,742 --> 00:30:43,876
只要...
Just...

429
00:30:43,878 --> 00:30:46,178
实话实说就好
give us the truth.

430
00:30:49,317 --> 00:30:51,750
事实是... 那个 呃...
The truth is... that, uh...

431
00:30:51,752 --> 00:30:54,053
事实是...
The truth is...

432
00:30:54,055 --> 00:30:58,057
我的妻子约亚拿自从结婚以来
that my wife, Joanna, ever since we were married,

433
00:30:58,059 --> 00:30:59,592
都会不时发疯
has had fits of madness.

434
00:30:59,594 --> 00:31:02,228
自从有了关于那个拿撒勒人
Since all the talk began of the Nazarene

435
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:04,230
死而复生的传言 她就...
coming back to life after being crucified, she's...

436
00:31:05,466 --> 00:31:07,399
嗯 她就整日想着此事
well, she's been taken by the idea.

437
00:31:07,401 --> 00:31:11,437
有时她会臆想自己在跟他说话
And sometimes she imagines she's talking to him.

438
00:31:11,439 --> 00:31:16,175
我怕有一天 她会陷入疯狂...
My fear is that one day, she'll slip into lunacy...

439
00:31:16,177 --> 00:31:18,444
无法恢复
and not return.

440
00:31:19,547 --> 00:31:24,517
你是说你的妻子并不是耶稣的信徒...
Your argument is that your wife isn't a follower of Jesus...

441
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:26,051
她只是疯了?
she's just mad?

442
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:30,890
女人 你又怎么说?
And what do you say, woman?

443
00:31:33,127 --> 00:31:34,393
你是... 疯了?
What are you... mad?

444
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,407
没错
It's true.

445
00:31:50,778 --> 00:31:53,779
我已不再鬼迷心窍
I was once cured of demons.

446
00:31:56,284 --> 00:31:58,918
我不允许我家有人向那个人祷告...
I do not allow prayers to that man in my household...

447
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,786
哪怕是臆想也不行
even imagined ones.

448
00:32:03,758 --> 00:32:05,124
管好你的妻子
Control your wife.

449
00:32:06,961 --> 00:32:09,028
够了 让他们走吧
Enough. Let them go.

450
00:32:10,031 --> 00:32:11,096
什么?!
What?!

451
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:13,132
就这样?!
That's all?!

452
00:32:22,343 --> 00:32:24,109
你能恢复真是太好了
It's good to have you back.

453
00:32:25,713 --> 00:32:26,979
好吧 我敞开心扉
Well, I open my heart,

454
00:32:26,981 --> 00:32:29,949
感谢神宽恕了我
and I give my thanks to God for his forgiveness.

455
00:32:29,951 --> 00:32:33,485
在沙漠的时候... 发生了什么?
What happened to you... in the desert?

456
00:32:34,989 --> 00:32:36,455
我看见他
I saw him.

457
00:32:37,792 --> 00:32:40,559
亲眼所见
I saw.

458
00:32:43,664 --> 00:32:46,632
我看见耶稣基督 神的儿子
I saw Jesus Christ, the son of God.

459
00:32:47,768 --> 00:32:49,468
他就在这
And he's here.

460
00:32:50,805 --> 00:32:52,871
那些被我迫害的信徒
His presence is here on earth,

461
00:32:52,873 --> 00:32:56,342
就是他存在的见证
through those followers I persecuted.

462
00:32:56,344 --> 00:32:58,811
我曾经那么确定我是对的
I felt so sure that I was right,

463
00:32:58,813 --> 00:33:00,012
但我...
but I...

464
00:33:00,014 --> 00:33:02,181
我才是错了的人
I was the one that was wrong.

465
00:33:03,251 --> 00:33:05,784
我们所有人都...
All of us just...

466
00:33:05,786 --> 00:33:08,087
错了
wrong.

467
00:33:08,089 --> 00:33:10,489
我必须将功赎罪 必须这样
I have to make amends. I have to.

468
00:33:10,491 --> 00:33:13,626
所以我去了河边
So I'm going to the river

469
00:33:13,628 --> 00:33:16,795
接受了这个人的洗礼... 亚拿尼亚
to be baptized by this man... Ananias.

470
00:33:16,797 --> 00:33:20,299
而我恳求你们... 跟我一起
And I implore you... come with me.

471
00:33:20,301 --> 00:33:22,434
感受神的爱
Feel God's love.

472
00:33:22,436 --> 00:33:26,205
奉耶稣的名受洗
Be baptized in the name of Jesus.

473
00:34:24,832 --> 00:34:27,166
太荒唐了
This is ridiculous.

474
00:34:27,168 --> 00:34:30,102
你愚蠢的梦让我无法入睡
You're keeping me awake with your foolish dream.

475
00:34:30,104 --> 00:34:32,204
告诉我
Tell me now.

476
00:34:32,206 --> 00:34:34,306
你看到了什么?
What is it you're seeing?

477
00:34:36,344 --> 00:34:40,346
我看见... 提庇留 
I see... Tiberius.

478
00:34:40,348 --> 00:34:43,482
看见他被杀死在床上
I see him murdered in his bed.

479
00:34:46,087 --> 00:34:48,453
我还看到当他们用枕头捂住他的脸时
And I see him struggle

480
00:34:48,455 --> 00:34:51,090
他... 他不断挣扎
as... as they hold a pillow over his face.

481
00:34:51,092 --> 00:34:54,326
拿枕头的人是卡里古拉
The pillow is held by Caligula.

482
00:34:55,629 --> 00:34:57,363
胡说
Nonsense.

483
00:34:58,532 --> 00:35:02,267
是你想象力太丰富
It's your fanciful imaginings.

484
00:35:25,492 --> 00:35:27,660
帮帮我
Help me.

485
00:35:27,662 --> 00:35:29,362
来人啊!
Someone!

486
00:35:29,364 --> 00:35:31,264
帮帮我!
Help me!!

487
00:35:34,135 --> 00:35:37,870
我看见耶稣基督 神的儿子
I saw Jesus Christ, the son of God.

488
00:35:37,872 --> 00:35:42,074
你怎敢奢求救赎 扫罗
How can you hope for salvation, Saul,

489
00:35:42,076 --> 00:35:44,277
明知你的双手沾满了耶稣信徒的
when you have the blood of those who chose Jesus

490
00:35:44,279 --> 00:35:46,045
鲜血?
on your hands?

491
00:35:48,383 --> 00:35:49,949
你说得对
You're right.

492
00:35:52,387 --> 00:35:55,521
你说得对
You're right.

493
00:35:55,523 --> 00:35:56,622
我希望...
And I hope...

494
00:35:58,359 --> 00:36:02,929
那些被我迫害过的人...
that all the people I persecuted...

495
00:36:02,931 --> 00:36:05,598
他们可以发自内心地原谅我
they can find it in their hearts to forgive me.

496
00:36:08,636 --> 00:36:12,205
我已经不是那个你们理应憎恨的人了
I'm not the same man you once had reason to hate.

497
00:36:13,241 --> 00:36:16,375
我以前眼盲
I was blind.

498
00:36:16,377 --> 00:36:18,344
而如今目明了
Now I see.

499
00:36:25,019 --> 00:36:27,787
巴拿巴
Barnabas.

500
00:36:31,092 --> 00:36:35,695
扫罗想受洗接受耶稣
Saul wants to be baptized to accept Jesus.

501
00:36:38,132 --> 00:36:40,233
我们怎能拒绝他呢?
How can we deny him that?

502
00:37:01,322 --> 00:37:04,056
耶稣拣选了你
Jesus has chosen you

503
00:37:04,058 --> 00:37:09,959
要在外邦人和君王并以色列人面前...
to proclaim his name to the world...to the gentiles, their kings, 

504
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:12,198
宣扬他的名
and the sons of Israel.

505
00:37:13,301 --> 00:37:16,535
我奉圣父 圣子和圣灵的名
I baptize you in the name of the father and of the son 

506
00:37:16,537 --> 00:37:17,703
为你洗礼
and of the Holy Spirit.

507
00:37:28,616 --> 00:37:30,716
我受洗了
I'm baptized.

508
00:37:30,718 --> 00:37:33,619
我受洗了
I'm baptized.

509
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:42,361
现在我可以传扬耶稣基督的道了!
Now I can spread the word of Jesus Christ!

510
00:37:43,531 --> 00:37:49,702
如果他原谅我 我会在耶稣里面得了丰盛!
If he will forgive me, I will be complete in Jesus!

511
00:37:49,704 --> 00:37:51,404
巴拿巴!
Barnabas!

512
00:37:57,679 --> 00:37:59,745
流便! 你怎么了?
Reuben! What's happened to you?

513
00:37:59,747 --> 00:38:01,247
你在这儿干嘛?
What are you doing here?

514
00:38:01,249 --> 00:38:03,516
- 我... 我不得不走来  - 什么?
- I... I had to walk.  - What?

515
00:38:03,518 --> 00:38:05,585
他... 他说
He... he said everything

516
00:38:05,587 --> 00:38:07,453
我们自以为知道的一切都是错的
that we thought we knew was wrong.

517
00:38:07,455 --> 00:38:08,521
谁? 谁说的?
Who? Who did?

518
00:38:08,523 --> 00:38:09,689
扫罗
Saul.

519
00:38:11,059 --> 00:38:13,125
他已经成了耶稣的信徒了
He's become a follower of Jesus.

520
00:38:15,063 --> 00:38:16,796
这主意很糟
This is a very bad idea.

521
00:38:16,798 --> 00:38:17,863
告诉他
Tell him.

522
00:38:17,865 --> 00:38:19,865
扫罗 你不能在犹太会堂
Saul, you can't preach the word of Jesus

523
00:38:19,867 --> 00:38:21,033
传耶稣的道
inside the synagogue.

524
00:38:21,035 --> 00:38:22,268
我们恰恰必须这样做
That is exactly what we have to do.

525
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:23,703
我明白你已经习惯
I understand that you're used to

526
00:38:23,705 --> 00:38:25,471
仰仗权威的力量
having the weight of the authorities behind you.

527
00:38:25,473 --> 00:38:27,707
如果他拣选我来宣扬他的名
If I have been chosen to proclaim his name,

528
00:38:27,709 --> 00:38:29,609
那最好是今日而非明日
better I do it today than tomorrow,

529
00:38:29,611 --> 00:38:31,744
最好是此时而非彼刻
better this hour than the next.

530
00:38:34,916 --> 00:38:36,515
最好是此刻
Better this moment.

531
00:38:42,991 --> 00:38:44,991
聚一下! 听我说!
Gather 'round! Listen to me!

我认为 只需要小小改变
I think, with a few changes

534
00:38:50,765 --> 00:38:52,798
和一些想象力...
and a little imagination...

535
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,500
别操之过急了
Don't get ahead of yourselves.

536
00:38:54,502 --> 00:38:56,602
提庇留还没做决定呢
Tiberius hasn't made his decision yet.

537
00:38:56,604 --> 00:38:59,805
作为我的继任者 我为你做出了一个好榜样
I made a good case for you as my successor.

538
00:38:59,807 --> 00:39:01,173
你永远不知道会发生什么
You never know what could happen.

539
00:39:01,175 --> 00:39:02,508
好了
Enough of this.

540
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:04,644
我们得到了想要的
We have what we wanted.

541
00:39:04,646 --> 00:39:06,779
知足就好
Let's just be grateful.

542
00:39:10,485 --> 00:39:16,555
我... 以为你随着大帝离开了
I... thought you left with the emperor.

543
00:39:16,557 --> 00:39:19,291
这多好啊?
Isn't that sweet?

544
00:39:19,293 --> 00:39:22,194
一对毒蛇刚要离开
As one pair of vipers prepare to leave,

545
00:39:22,196 --> 00:39:25,031
另一对就打算搬进来了
another plans to move in.

546
00:39:25,033 --> 00:39:28,467
我的朋友! 我就知道他们不能把我们分开
My friend! I knew they couldn't keep us apart.

547
00:39:32,006 --> 00:39:35,041
我带来了消息...
I bring news...

548
00:39:35,043 --> 00:39:37,343
非常不好的消息
very grave news.

549

出人意料
It's shocking news.

552
00:40:02,103 --> 00:40:04,670
我真是...
I was...

553
00:40:04,672 --> 00:40:07,073
非常震惊
shocked.

554
00:40:07,075 --> 00:40:09,175
但我们应该感恩
We must be thankful.

555
00:40:09,177 --> 00:40:13,012
我听说他睡在床上... 走得很安详
I'm told he died peacefully... in his bed.

556
00:40:22,123 --> 00:40:28,461
你在期待罗马的新职位吗?

557
00:40:47,682 --> 00:40:49,248
多可惜啊
Such a shame.

558
00:40:50,518 --> 00:40:55,020
你的丈夫在这个宫殿里

00:40:55,022 --> 00:40:58,991
用刀抵着我的喉咙
held a blade against my throat.

00:41:01,395 --> 00:41:03,429
他真的很想我死
He really wanted me dead.

561
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:07,333
过去的就过去吧?
Can't that be left in the past?

00:41:09,103 --> 00:41:10,603
没错
Yes.

563
00:41:10,605 --> 00:41:13,239
你说得对
You're right.

00:41:13,241 --> 00:41:16,108
让我们关注当下
Let's stay with the present.

565
