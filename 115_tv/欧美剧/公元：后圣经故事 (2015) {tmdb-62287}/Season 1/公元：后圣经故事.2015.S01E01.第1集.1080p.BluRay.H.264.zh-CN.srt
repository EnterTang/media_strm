你拒绝回答吗?
Are you going to refuse to answer?

15
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,740
你是不是弥赛亚?
Are you or are you not the Messiah?

16
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,080
我是
I am.

17

19
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,260
你胆敢直呼他的尊名?!
How dare you speak his name?!

20
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,560
他犯了亵渎神明之罪

00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,860
应当处死!
He deserves to die!

犹大!

23
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,780
你
You.

这个人是拿撒勒人的同伙!

00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,580
我... 我不认识他 你们认错人了!

00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,010
那个拿撒勒人的名望助长了
The Nazarene's popularity has strengthened

34
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,380
犹太教狂热信徒的造反之心
the zealots' resolve to rise against us.

35
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,480
审判他可能会引发叛乱
His trial could trigger rebellion.

36
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,220
一个犹太人的话怎能对抗整个罗马的势力?
The word of one Jew against the might of Rome?

37

我不这么认为 马略

放了他!

42
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:12,080
你是犹太人的王吗?
Are you the king of the Jews?

43
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,850
我的国不属这世界
My kingdom is not of this world.

那么你是王吗?
So you are a king, then?

45
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,590
你说我是王

我为此而生 也为此来到世间
I was born and came into this world

47
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,400
特为给真理作见证

真理?
Truth?

何为真理?

51
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,830
我查不出他有什么罪来
I find no basis for a charge against him.

52
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,070
钉他十字架!
Crucify him!

53
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,700
带走他...
Take him...

54
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:37,300
并钉他十字架!
and crucify him.

55

钉他十字架!
Crucify him!

56
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,690
让开!
Out of the way!

57
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,200
钉进去
Nail them in.

58
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,350
逾越节

59
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,350
看他们倾其所有地进贡
See how they come in their hundreds of thousands

60
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,420
来祈求神的庇护
to keep themselves in God's favor.

61
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,550
这神殿的确是整个庆典中
It is undeniable that the temple is a great focal point

62
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,520
人们的焦点 神父
for their celebrations, father.

63
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,220
但他们的生活得以蒸蒸日上
However, they thrive in their daily lives

64
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,960
全靠大祭司的领导
due to the leadership of the high priest.

65
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:50,800
你保护了我们的祭祀礼仪
You have protected our sacrificial rites admirably

66
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:54,830
使之不随拿撒勒人的私念而被废除
against the Nazarene's desire to sweep them away.

67
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,270
我唯一的遗憾是让巡抚参与进来了
My one regret is that you involved the Governor.

68
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,270
动用罗马法的全部条令很有必要
It was necessary to call upon the full force of Roman law.

69
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:03,310
把那拿撒勒人钉上十字架警告了
The Nazarene's crucifixion sends a message

70
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,340
所有想毁掉我们辛苦支撑起的信仰的人
to all who might challenge what we labor so hard to uphold.

71
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,880
你做得很对
You did the right thing.

72
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,750
这还有待定论
That is open to question.

73
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,020
久而久之 会有更多的人被那个拿撒勒人
Day by day, more and more people were being seduced

74
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:16,250
通俗的说教所迷惑
by the Nazarene's simplistic homilies.

75
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,060
他必须被揭发
He had to be exposed.

76
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,460
并如此残忍地处决?
And so brutally executed?

77
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,090
我丈夫所做的决定
My husband took a decision

78
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,930
是所有大祭司都会做的决定
any high priest would have taken.

79
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,160
虽然我在管事的时候
Though my methods may have differed

80
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,400
做法会不同
during my time in office,

81
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,430
但最终目标还是一致的
I would have pursued the same objective.

82
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,640
这是在滥杀无辜
It was the needless death of a harmless soul.

83
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,500
"无辜"?
"Harmless"?

84
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,640
他威胁了我们所代表的一切
He threatened everything we represent

85
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,340
以及人们的信仰
and these people believe in.

86
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,710
约瑟 为了神的子民
The life of one man is as nothing, Joseph,

87
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,880
一条人命不足为惜
for the sake of God's nation.

88
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:41,880
该亚法...
Caiaphas...

89
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:42,980
够了
Ah, enough.

90
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,150
晚餐时再见吧
We shall see you at supper.

91
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:53,390
约瑟夫和他的崇高道德
Joseph and his lofty morals.

92
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:57,100
凌驾于公共事务的污垢之上
Floating above the daily grime of public affairs.

93
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,060
空话易说
Well, words come cheap.

94
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,500
不付诸实际行动
Without actions to test them,

95
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,840
他就是纸上谈兵
his opinions are fruitless.

96
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,190
同享这盛宴吧 我们饿坏了
Share this feast. We're hungry.

97
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,220
那个拿撒勒人自称
Is it correct the Nazarene alleged

98
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,790
能起死回生 是吗?
he would rise from death?

99
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,790
他那是在胡说八道
One of his many outrageous claims

100
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,860
并对预言无理篡改
and crude manipulations of prophecy.

101
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:31,400
那就确保他迅速死去
Then ensure he dies swiftly

102
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,030
别让他有机会实施最后的骗术
before he has the chance to perform a final deception.

103
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,500
赶在天黑前 该亚法
Before the first star, Caiaphas.

104
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,000
别让那肮脏之景
Before the very sight of the rogue

105
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,910
玷污了我们的庆典
is allowed to pollute our celebrations.

106
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:49,210
耶和华阿 我要求告你
To you Lord, I call.

107
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,220
我的磐石阿
You are my rock.

108
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,490
不要向我缄默 倘若你向我闭口
Do not turn a deaf ear to me, for if you remain silent,

109
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,790
我就如将死的人一样
I shall be like those who go down to the pit.

110
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,190
我呼求你
Hear my cry for mercy.

111
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,530
向你至圣所举手的时候
I call for your help

112
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,760
求你垂听我恳求的声音
as I lift my hands to your most holy place.

113
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,210
主啊?
My God?

114
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,750
主啊?
My God?

115
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,350
为什么离弃我?
Why have you forsaken me?

116
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,700
报告两件事 巡抚
Two items, Governor.

117
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:49,310
大祭司该亚法要求尽快处决
A request to expedite the death of the Nazarene

118
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,840
那个拿撒勒人
from high priest Caiaphas

119
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:57,720
另有人请求在那个拿撒勒人死后取走他的尸体
and a petition to repossess the Nazarene's body upon death.

120
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,350
谁请求取走尸体?
Who requests the body?

121
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,090
一位犹太长老
A Jewish elder

122
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,420
他因为犹太公会对那个拿撒勒人的迫害而倍感烦恼
troubled by the Sanhedrin's persecution of the Nazarene.

123
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,560
他的姓名?
His name?

124
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,690
来自亚利马太的约瑟
Joseph of Arimathea.

125
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,460
俱准了
Grant each request.

126
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,630
让他们继续互相争吵
Keeping them at each other's throats

127
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:18,470
好叫他们不要来摆布我们
prevents them from wrapping their fingers around ours.

128
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:25,380
叫哥尼流去结束那个拿撒勒人的痛苦吧
And have Cornelius put the Nazarene out of his misery.

129
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:56,310
你喜欢这幅奇观吗?
Are you enjoying the spectacle?

130
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,540
奇观?
Spectacle?

131
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,910
你就是如此看待
Is that how you regard

132
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,910
拿撒勒人被钉上十字架这事的吗?
the crucifixion of the Nazarene?

133
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:05,550
在罗马的土地上宣称为王的人
Any man who claims to be king in a Roman province

134
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,620
便犯了叛国罪
is committing treason

135
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:08,990
必须承受这后果
and must suffer the consequences.

136
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,120
在我的梦里他并不如王一般行事
He does not behave as a king in my dreams.

137
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,530
这领地的运转可不能由
The running of the province can hardly be determined

138
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,200
巡抚夫人的梦来决定
by the dreams of the Governor's wife.

139
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,970
神会在我们沉眠时找到我们
The gods find us in our sleep.

140
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,770
他们的讯息很明确
Their message was clear.

141
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,140
那个拿撒勒人是个好人
The Nazarene is a good man.

142
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:27,470
谦卑 清心
Humble. Pure of heart.

143
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:34,150
那个人对现状而言是个危险
The man was a danger to the status quo.

144
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,850
我们在犹太的驻军规模并不大 克劳迪娅
Our Garrison in Judea is not large, Claudia.

145
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,450
你会后悔参与了他的死亡
You'll live to regret your hand in his death.

146
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,790
我采纳了建议
I took advice.

147
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,320
我权衡了利弊
I weighed it up.

148
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,020
我照章办事
I acted accordingly.

149
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,160
你采纳的建议来自那些
Advice from men

150
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:49,090
惧怕他的风头会盖过自己的人
who feared his popularity would eclipse their own.

151
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,060
他宣称自己是他们的弥赛亚
He claimed to be their Messiah.

152
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,230
让人忍无可忍
It was intolerable.

153
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,230
最坏情况不过是他疯了!
At worst, he's mad!

154
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,500
难道这足以...
Is that reason enough...

155
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,200
克劳迪娅
Claudia.

156
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,870
所有犹太牧师都与我作对
It's tiresome enough

157
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,840
已经让我够烦了
having every Jewish priest on my back.

158
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,910
我可不希望我的夫人也加入他们的行列
I don't expect my own wife to join them,

159
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,850
而且没错 即便他是疯子
and, yes, even if he were mad,

160
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,550
我们也必须把他钉起来好除灭他这使者
we should nail him up to destroy the messenger

161
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:15,090
也警告人民不能听信他的传道!
and to warn the people against his message!

162
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:23,100
杀了他并不会是他的终结
Killing him won't be the end of him.

163
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:26,670
通常是如此 亲爱的
It usually is, my darling.

164
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:04,000
成... 成了...
I... it is... finished.

165
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,410
自己逃命吧!
Save yourselves!

166
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,380
跟我来!
Come with me!

167
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,050
别挡着我!
Out of my way!

168
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,120
走这里!
This way!

169
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,150
这是他的母亲
This is his mother.

170
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,420
那又如何?
So?

171
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,320
就别验了 你能看出他已经死了
Spare her this. You can see he's dead.

172
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,220
那得由我说了算
I'll be the judge of that.

173
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:32,090
实在不必如此
There's no need for this.

174
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:33,690
求你了
Please.

175
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:36,100
上头的命令是要确保他死了
The order is to make sure.

176
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,240
来者何人
Identify yourself.

177
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,480
我有权拥有
I have permission to take possession

178
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,910
那个拿撒勒人的尸体
of the Nazarene's body.

179
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:52,910
谁的许可?
On whose authority?

180
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:56,180
巡抚的
The Governor's.

181
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,320
若您愿意
If you will allow,

182
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,350
我愿贡献出我自己的墓地
I would like to offer my own tomb

183
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,490
作为您儿子的安息之地
as your son's final place of rest.

184
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,160
他在那会得享安宁
He'll be at peace there.

185
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,710
我已做下最糟糕的事...
I've done the most terrible thing...

186
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,110
这行为不可饶恕
for which there can be no forgiveness.

187
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,220
我卖了无辜之人的血!
I've betrayed innocent blood!

188
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,840
她累坏了
She's exhausted.

189
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,840
她在等待
She's waiting.

190
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,250
她是真的坚信不疑
Does she really believe it,

191
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,180
还是悲痛让她宁愿相信一个虚无缥缈的希望?
or is it what her grief wills her to believe?

192
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,420
我觉得她真的坚信他会从死里复活
I think she truly believes he will rise from death.

193
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,850
你信吗?
Do you?

194
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:24,900
我明晚再告诉你们剩下的故事
And I'll tell you the rest of the story tomorrow night.

195
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,700
晚安 去吧 上床去
Good night. Come, off to bed.

196
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,470
晚安
Good night.

197
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,410
晚安
Good night.

198
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,750
喝点东西
Drink something.

199
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:47,020
有生之年我从不敢想象
In my lifetime, I could never have imagined

200
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:50,660
神的殿堂竟会遭受如此损毁
such an assault on the house of God.

201
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,760
我的心都碎了
My heart breaks.

202
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,900
我们可以修复它
We can restore it.

203
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:59,170
又不是因为你的缘故
It was not of your making.

204
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,670
没人死亡已经是奇迹
Miraculous that no one was killed.

205
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,910
啊
Ah.

206
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,440
我们还以为你不会来了
We thought you weren't coming.

207
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,480
抱歉
Apologies.

208
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,040
请进 请进
Come in. Come in.

209
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,480
我们有事耽搁了
We were waylaid.

210
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,880
怎么了?
Why?

211
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:17,220
我安葬了一个可怜的灵魂
I was laying a poor soul to rest.

212
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,420
亲戚吗?
A relative?

213
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,850
被钉上十字架的那个拿撒勒人
The crucified Nazarene.

214
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,090
你再说一遍?
I beg your pardon?

215
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,490
他死后理应得到尊重
He deserved greater respect in death

216
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,960
而不该再像生前所承受的那样
than he'd ever been afforded in life.

217
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:29,860
约瑟啊 他的追随者称他为拉比
Because his followers named him Rabbi, Joseph,

218
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,400
不代表他就是的
doesn't mean he was one.

219
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,370
拿撒勒人为那些
The Nazarene gave succor

220
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,840
与罗马对抗的人提供帮助
to those would take up arms against Rome.

221
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,940
这将成为灾难
Which would have been a disaster,

222
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,410
罗马会因此而招兵买马
prompting Rome to unleash reinforcements

223
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,610
最后导致犹太人的鲜血
that would turn the Mediterranean red

224
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,840
染红整个地中海
with Jewish blood.

225
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,980
我不认为会有这样的威胁
I don't agree he posed the threat you believe.

226
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,350
这就是你永远不会成为大祭司的原因
Which is why you will never become the high priest.

227
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,280
犹太人民忍受了
The Jewish people have survived

228
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,290
太多帝国的暴虐统治
the tyranny of many empires

229
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,090
他们务实又忍让
with pragmatism and compromise.

230
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,360
谨慎地前行
With careful helmsmanship,

231
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,330
他们会比罗马帝国存活地更为长久
it will outlast the Roman occupation.

232
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,560
也不至于要罗马帝国把犹太人钉死在十字架上
Not by asking Rome to crucify Jews, it won't.

233
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,230
我能问一下那个拿撒勒人被埋葬在哪里吗?
May I ask where the Nazarene was buried?

234
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,030
在我的墓地
In my tomb.

235
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,300
"人还使他与恶人同埋
"And he made his grave with the wicked

236
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,970
谁知死的时候与财主同葬"
and his tomb with the rich."

237
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,610
你很熟悉以赛亚的预言吗?
You are familiar with Isaiah's prophecy?

238
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,440
我并不盲从于预言 而是尊重
I wasn't compelled by prophecy, but decency.

239
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,180
我很难相信
I find this hard to believe.

240
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,580
就在我们试图
At the very hour we sought

241
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,620
熄灭这个危险的火苗时
to extinguish this dangerous flame,

242
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:25,750
你却又亲手把它点燃!
you take it upon yourself to re-ignite it!

243
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,550
我不是有意为之
I had no intention other than

244
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:30,920
只是想体面地结束这一肮脏的事件
to bring this sordid episode to a dignified conclusion.

245
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,330
但对那些脆弱的心灵来说
But to the weak of mind,

246
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:36,360
你就是在让以赛亚的预言成真!
you create the appearance of fulfilling Isaiah!

247
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,330
你难道看不出其中的问题吗?
Do you not understand the issue here?

248
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:41,230
他究竟犯了什么罪?
What precisely was his crime?

249
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,540
是因为他宣扬待人
To preach that we should treat each other

250
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,840
要以待己之道吗?
as we ourselves would wish to be treated?

251
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,110
他被处决是因为反复亵渎神明
He was killed for the repeated blasphemy

252
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,910
声称自己是弥赛亚
of claiming to be the Messiah.

253
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,810
- 如果他是呢?  - 那他也已经不是了
- And if he was?  - Then he is no more.

254
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:54,350
罗马并未对犹大省严加管制
Rome holds Judea loose in its hand

255
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:58,520
只是因为犹太公会可以管理自己的人民
only as long as the Sanhedrin is able to manage its people.

256
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:01,320
除了和平与爱
In addition to peace and love,

257
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,460
拿撒勒人煽动人们
the Nazarene preached insurrection

258
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,960
反抗所有当权者
against all authority.

259
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:05,960
我不同意
I disagree.

260
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,400
你竟如此傲慢!
Such arrogance!

261
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:21,410
约瑟 你终会明白
But you will see, Joseph.

262
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,050
记着我的话 无论是否在你的墓地里
You have my word, in or out of your tomb,

263
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:30,150
拿撒勒人的教义都将随其尸体一起腐烂
the Nazarene's doctrine will decompose with his corpse.

264
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:42,100
彼得!
Peter!

265
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,600
你怎么了?
What happened to you?

266
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,780
我被认出来了
I was recognized.

267
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:58,550
我努力逃了出来
I managed to get away.

268
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,820
其他人在这里吗?
The others are here?

269
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,120
没有 玛利亚确信
No. Mary is convinced

270
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,850
当权者会追捕我们
the authorities will be hunting us down.

271
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,220
你应该马上离开
You should leave immediately.

272
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,390
自己一个人? 不
Without them? No.

273
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,430
你去了哪里 彼得?
Where were you, Peter?

274
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,440
他死了吗?
Is he dead?

275
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,910
我亲手安葬了他
I laid him to rest myself.

276
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:42,920
那就结束了
Then it's over.

277
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:55,700
耶稣曾预言犹大会向公会揭发自己
Jesus foretold that Judas would betray him to the Sanhedrin.

278
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:59,510
他确实那样做了
And he did.

279
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:03,910
他也曾预言你会说不认识他
He also foretold that you would deny him.

280
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,050
告诉我们你没那么说
Tell us you didn't.

281
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,950
我不能撒谎
I can't lie.

282
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:16,060
在审判的时候
There was a trial.

283
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:21,460
那些暴徒恨不得吸干他的血 然后...
The mob was baying for his blood, and...

284
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,800
我被认出来了
I was recognized.

285
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:33,510
如果他都死了 还有什么分别呢?
What difference does any of this now make if he's dead?

286
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:39,980
我们虚度了生命中最后的三年
The last three years of our lives for nothing.

287
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:43,250
他的母亲相信他会重生
His mother believes he will rise.

288
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,650
如果是真的 我宁愿失去这只手!
I would give this arm to believe the same!

289
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,990
从没想过你会是个懦夫
I never had you for a coward.

290
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,620
从来没有
Never.

291
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,150
退后! 退后!
Back! Back up!

292
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,930
让他走开
Send him away.

293
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,410
德鲁苏斯
Drusus.

294
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,590
巡抚
Governor.

295
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,400
神殿大祭司求见
The high priest of the temple.

296
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,460
他不能等我用完餐吗?
Can't it wait until after I've eaten?

297
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,800
不 恐怕不行
No, I'm afraid it can't.

298
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,470
这件事有点紧急
This is a matter of some urgency.

299
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,840
该亚法 紧急似乎是你的常态
"Urgent" appears to be your default state of mind, Caiaphas.

300
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,440
因为我们生活在动荡的时代 巡抚
We live in turbulent times, Governor.

301
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,770
我有一个请求
I have a request.

302
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:08,940
又来一个?
Another one?

303
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:11,810
千万别告诉我又是关于拿撒勒人的
Please tell me it doesn't concern the Nazarene.

304
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,950
我对您迄今为止代表我们所做出的
I'm certainly grateful for the decisive manner

305
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,980
果断决定深表感激
in which you've acted on our behalf so far.

306
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,950
迄今为止?
"So far"?

307
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,350
你想要得寸进尺
You seek more from me on this.

308
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,750
恐怕是的
I'm afraid so.

309
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:24,460
你想把他钉死在十字架上 我已经钉死他了
You wanted him crucified, I had him crucified.

310
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,960
还有什么必须做的吗?
What more is necessary?

311
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:32,160
这个无名小卒又有什么事扰你不得安宁了?
What is it about this nobody that so disturbs you?

312
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,530
如您所知 他的尸体被葬在了
As you know, his corpse has been placed

313
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,000
一位长老的墓地中
in the tomb of an elder.

314
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,670
"如您所知"是什么意思?
What do you mean, "as you know"?

315
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,300
是真的吗?
Is this true?

316
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,610
是有人请愿
A petition was made.

317
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,110
您一定要知道这会导致怎样的冲突
You must have known the friction it would cause.

318
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,010
从没想过这个问题
It never crossed my mind.

319
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,880
与他过去的恶行一样
In keeping with his practice,

320
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:50,320
拿撒勒人歪曲了先人们
the Nazarene distorted ancient prophecies

321
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,480
关于弥赛亚复活的预言
relating to the rise of our Messiah

322
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,720
并且散播谣言 声称在他死去三天之后
and spread rumor that he would rise from his own death

323
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,360
他将复活
after three days.

324
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:00,160
该亚法 钉死在十字架上是不会复活的
Roman crucifixion really doesn't allow for that, Caiaphas.

325
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,660
然而 允许他的尸体被埋葬
Nevertheless, by allowing his body to be entombed 

326
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,400
而不是让野兽吃掉
and not consumed by wild beasts,

327
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:06,800
你给了他的门徒机会
you've granted an opportunity to his followers

328
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:10,540
去制造耶稣复活的假象
to enact the appearance of resurrection.

329
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:13,170
我们都明白 在耶路撒冷 一个假象
And as we know, in Jerusalem, the appearance of a thing

330
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:15,710
和事物本身同样有说服力
is often as potent as the thing itself.

331
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,740
你相信门徒们会在三天后侵入墓地?
You believe they will raid the tomb after three days?

332
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:22,850
这是操纵事件最简单的方法
It'd be the simplest way to manipulate events.

333
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,020
那就确保尸体不会被盗走
Then ensure it isn't removed.

334
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:26,350
让神殿的护卫把守在外面
Post temple guards outside.

335
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:28,890
恐怕我的人并阻止不了
I fear my men would pose no deterrent

336
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,560
那帮狂徒
to a band of fanatics.

337
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:34,390
你希望我浪费罗马士兵
You want me to waste Roman soldiers

338
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:36,830
去看守一个犹太人的墓地?
guarding a Jewish hole?

339
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,060
还要在墓上贴上罗马封条
And place a Roman seal across the tomb.

340
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,170
非法入侵将会被处以死刑
Its unlawful breaking carries the death penalty.

341
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,970
你要求的太多了
You ask too much.

342
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
如果您没有允许埋葬他
Had you not granted permission to entomb him,

343
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,770
局势就不会像现在这样
this situation would not have arisen.

344
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:49,910
不管他躺在哪里 他目前对于
Where he lies, he currently remains a threat

345
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,740
公会和罗马都仍是威胁
both to the Sanhedrin and to Rome.

346
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:57,150
一个人?
One man?

347
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:01,420
你低估了罗马最高领主的能力
You underestimate the might of your Roman overlords.

348
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:08,860
但如果这样做可以结束掉这一切
But if it will finally bring an end to this,

349
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:12,430
我会派遣一小队士兵去看守墓地
I will post a small guard outside the tomb.

350
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,870
感激不尽
I cannot thank you enough.

351
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,470
终于 我们有达成一致的事情了
At last, something we can agree upon.

352
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,650
你怎么没告诉我?
Why didn't you tell me?

353
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:32,350
我不需要向你或是任何人说明我的决定
I don't have to account for my decisions to you or anyone else.

354
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,970
不要张望 马太
Don't look now, Matthew,

355
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,930
我觉得我们可能被发现了
but I think we may have been spotted.

356
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,240
要回头吗?
Do you want to go back?

357
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,100
如果回头 就证实了他们的怀疑
If we do, we confirm their suspicions.

358
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,240
继续走
Just keep moving forward.

359
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,270
嘿! 你们!
Hey! You!

360
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,140
跑!
Run!

361
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:09,720
你喊我就杀了你 明白吗?
Shout out and you're dead, understood?

362
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,690
这边! 继续找!
This way! Keep looking!

363
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,930
罗马士兵为什么在追你们?
Why were you running from the Romans?

364
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:22,330
在我们杀死你们之前
You have one chance to speak the truth

365
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:24,040
你有一次机会说出真相
before we leave your corpses here.

366
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:27,440
我们是拿撒勒的耶稣的门徒
We're disciples of Jesus of Nazareth.

367
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:29,340
继续说
Go on.

368
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,680
在他被捕之后 我们逃出城去了
We fled the city after he was captured.

369
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,610
那你们为什么现在要回这个犹大省
Then why come back to where there are more Roman soldiers

370
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:35,610
罗马士兵最多的地方?
than anywhere else in Judea?

371
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:40,420
为了找我们的兄弟
To find our brothers.

372
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,930
他像凡人一样流血
Well, he bled like a man.

373
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:59,040
把它弄走
Remove it.

374
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,740
但要拆掉
But break it up.

375
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,880
我认识这个人
I recognize this man.

376
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,250
波阿斯
Boaz.

377
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,480
你认识这个狂热分子?
You know this zealot?

378
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,490
我们小时候在加利利一起玩耍的
We played together in Galilee as children.

379
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,090
很久以前的事了 彼得
An age away, Peter.

380
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,390
时间改变了我们
The times reshape us all.

381
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:23,700
是的
They do.

382
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,700
你是耶稣的门徒?
You are disciples of the Nazarene?

383
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,170
我们是
We are.

384
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,370
你们的领导者有很多追随者
Your leader had a great following on the streets.

385
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:36,880
当权者密谋并杀害了他
The authorities colluded and murdered him.

386
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:41,080
加入我们 成为一股真正能对抗他们的力量
Join us and become a real force to be reckoned with.

387
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:44,380
和罗马人开战?
Fighting the Romans?

388
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,520
不计代价将他们赶出我们的土地
Whatever it takes to drive them off our land.

389
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:49,250
生于剑 死于刀
Live by the sword, and you die by the sword.

390
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:53,060
那总好过像被拴住的狗一样
Better that than like a dog on a leash.

391
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:55,360
你的老师宣扬爱
Your master preached love.

392
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:58,230
我将拼死宣扬自由
I shall die preaching freedom.

393
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,130
加入我们!
Join us!

394
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:15,580
我们是渔夫 不是战士
We are fishermen, not fighters.

395
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:19,780
他们不会善罢甘休的
They won't stop with him.

396
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,190
你知道的吧?
You do know that?

397
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,950
一旦他们认识到
Once the Romans realize

398
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:25,890
你们的启示仍是威胁
your message remains a threat,

399
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:27,960
他们会将你们连根拔除
they will root you out.

400
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:30,260
当他们杀光所有门徒
And when they've killed each of you,

401
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,730
就会一个接一个的清除他的思想
they will snuff out his ideas one by one

402
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:36,740
直到你们好像从来没有存在过一样
until it will be as if you never existed.

403
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:37,970
加入我们
Join us.

404
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,040
我不能
I cannot.

405
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,080
我们在等什么?
What are we waiting for?

406
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:52,580
我想出来的可以让你不再
The means by which I intend to put an end

407
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:56,050
不停地为这个耶稣啜泣的办法
to your incessant mewling about this Jesus.

408
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:58,390
我没有保持观点的权利吗?
Am I not entitled to an opinion?

409
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,590
你有的
You are.

410
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,760
但妄想不是一种观点 克劳迪娅
But obsession is not opinion, Claudia,

411
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:04,530
而且反常的妄想需要彻底的根治
and unhealthy obsession requires radical treatment,

412
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,000
根治的办法我想现在也该到了
which I believe is arriving now.

413
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:17,370
哥尼流 我有点事只有你可以处理
Cornelius, I have a certain matter only you can clear up.

414
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:19,240
如果我可以的话 愿意效劳
If I can, of course.

415
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,480
我想从你这里了解一件事情
I need to know one thing from you.

416
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:26,880
当他被放到坟墓里的时候
When he was placed inside his tomb,

417
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:31,550
你确定拿撒勒人已经死了吗?
are you certain the Nazarene was dead?

418
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:35,160
大人 当我被命令去做事 我就去做
Sir, when I'm instructed to do a job, I do it.

419
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:37,230
我当时被命令确保
I was instructed to ensure

420
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,460
拿撒勒人死在十字架上
the death of the Nazarene on the cross,

421
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,930
我那时就是这么做的
and that's what I did.

422
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,400
他在你面前断气了?
He expired before you?

423
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:43,170
比这还好
Better than that.

424
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,630
他是因为我才断的气
He expired because of me.

425
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:48,340
你验过尸体了吗?
And you performed the proofs of death?

426
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:49,810
我让朗基奴斯拿枪
I instructed Longinus to insert his spear

427
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,570
扎拿撒勒人的肋旁
hard between the Nazarene's ribs.

428
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:52,680
他死了?
And he was dead?

429
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:55,140
扎进去之前和之后都死了
Before and after the spear.

430
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,110
所以说 对于任何怀有
So, to anyone who might entertain

431
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:59,780
他可能没死的妄想的人
the notion that he might not be dead,

432
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:03,790
认为拿撒勒人在经受了你方才所说的一切后
that the Nazarene might actually somehow have remained alive

433
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,620
还奇迹般的活着的人
after all of what you've just described,

434
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,660
你会怎么说?
you would say what?

435
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:12,190
我会说他们不是疯子就是傻瓜
I would say they were either mad or a fool.

436
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,000
谢谢 哥尼流
Thank you, Cornelius.

437
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:16,330
你可以退下了
You may go.

438
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:27,140
别疑神疑鬼说无稽之谈了 克劳迪娅
Enough of your dreams and nonsense, Claudia.

439
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:31,180
那个拿撒勒人也不过是血肉之躯
The Nazarene was only ever flesh and blood.

440
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:33,520
而他的血肉
And we have butchered the former

441
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:38,490
已被我们洒在这个城市
and spilled the latter all over the city.

442
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,360
但如果你再梦到他
But if you should dream of him again,

443
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:43,660
确保他真的化成肉身
be sure he proves his true identity

444
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:46,060
证明自己的身份
by his real incarnation.

445
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:51,830
不是什么花言巧语的预言
Not as a handsome prophet with charisma,

446
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:55,400
而是站在地上的腐烂肉体
but as a rotting pile of meat on the floor.

447
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,980
我只是不确定
I'm just questioning

448
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,720
现在离开耶路撒冷
whether leaving Jerusalem at this moment in time

449
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:10,820
是正确的抉择
is the right course of action.

450
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:12,320
保住自己的命
How can saving our lives

451
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,590
怎么可能不是正确的选择?
not be the right course of action?!

452
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,760
我们不一定能走到城墙
There's no guarantee we'll make it to the city wall.

453
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:19,500
但他们也不一定在追杀我们
But there's no guarantee they're actually coming after us.

454
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:22,360
大祭司和彼拉多形影不离
The high priest walks hand-in-hand with Pilate!

455
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,100
他们已经杀了我们的领导者
They killed our leader.

456
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,870
我们有何能继续危害他们的权威?!
How do we continue to pose a threat to their authority?!

457
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:31,370
五千人走到遥远的山坡上
5,000 people on a remote hillside

458
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:32,840
只为听他布道...
just to hear him preach...

459
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,780
那是他 不是我们
That was him, not us.

460
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:38,210
你们难道已经忘了他的预言?
Have you forgotten his prophecy already?

461
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:42,320
你忘了吗 彼得?
Have you forgotten, Peter?

462
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:50,460
第三日时 他保证会起死复生
On the third day, he promises to rise from death.

463
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,930
您需要休息
You need to rest.

464
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,270
他们怎么这么快就忘了?
Have they forgotten so quickly?

465
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:06,710
他们不能等等吗?
Can they not wait?

466
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:09,780
你们就不能等等吗?!
Can you not wait?!

467
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:18,120
她亲见他被折磨和杀害
She watched him being tortured and killed,

468
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,460
目睹了全程
moment by moment.

469
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:20,660
他已经死了
He's dead.

470
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:23,490
但我们没有
But we are not.

471
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:27,760
我们的亲人在加利利北部等我们回归
Our flesh and blood waits up north in Galilee for our return.

472
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,230
我们现在要为家人着想
Our duty now is to our families.

473
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:33,000
三天
Three days.

474
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:38,410
这是我欠他的
I owe him that much.

475
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:44,450
我们对他的信仰值得等这三天
Our faith in him has to be worth three days.

476
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,780
要是他第三日没有复活呢?
And if he fails to rise on the third?

477
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:50,650
那我们像男人一样离开
Then we leave like men.

478
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,960
而不是懦夫
Not cowards.

479
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:06,670
你认为他会回来
You think he's coming back.

480
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,670
我相信他会
I know he is.

481
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:11,140
你怎能如此确定?
How are you so sure?

482
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:14,780
他让别人重生过
He raised others from death.

483
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:18,450
预言如是说
This is what was prophesied.

484
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,320
而且他保证过
And he promised.

485
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:24,920
所以何不复活自己呢?
Then why not himself?

486
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,190
- 大祭司  - 啊
- High priest.  - Ah.

487
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:35,030
我要你在亚利马太的坟墓布下寺庙的守卫
I want you to post temple guards at Arimathea's tomb.

488
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,700
必须封死墓穴
It must remain sealed.

489
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:40,000
守卫不许跟任何人说话 不许让任何人通过
They speak to no one, they let no one pass,

490
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,640
而且他们只听命于我
and they report only to me.

491
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,870
找到加略人了
Iscariot's been found.

492
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,210
那个叛徒?
The betrayer?

493
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,240
他能带我们找到其他人吗?
Well, will he lead us to the others?

494
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,080
他死在了波特墓园
He lies dead in the Potter's field.

495
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:53,020
上吊自尽
He hanged himself.

496
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:55,320
这个耶稣到底有什么本领
What is it about this Jesus

497
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,320
让他们如此疯狂?
that drives them to such madness?

498
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:59,360
有何关系呢?
What does it matter?

499
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:02,160
没有尸体 他们就不能假装他起死复生
Without his body, they can't pretend he's risen from death.

500
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,580
你陪他到最后一刻了吗?
You were with him at the end?

501
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:34,050
只有约翰
Only John.

502
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:41,590
罗马人杀害他的场景极其残忍
The Romans turned his death into an atrocious spectacle.

503
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:49,570
他们把他打到皮开肉绽
They flayed him until his back split open.

504
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,700
就好像想把他的肉一片一片地割下来
It was as if they wanted to cut him down one piece at a time

505
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:56,440
直到他不能动弹
until he could barely move.

506
00:37:56,470 --> 00:38:02,350
他们逼他跪下 把荆棘插进他的头里
They forced him to his feet and drove thorns into his head.

507
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,820
他们逼着他...
They made him...

508
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:10,190
拖着十字架走到各各它
drag his cross to Golgotha,

509
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,660
把他钉在了上面...
where they nailed him to it...

510
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,800
然后竖起来示众
and raised him up for all to see.

511
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:24,300
你不在并没有关系
It doesn't matter that you weren't there.

512
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,000
他理解我们的软弱
He understood our weakness.

513
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,640
他爱我们如此
He loved us for it.

514
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,470
为此而死
Died for it.

515
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:34,180
如今这都不重要了
None of this matters now.

516
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:35,680
你听到狂热者的话了
You heard the zealot.

517
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:41,120
我们得在被他们找到之前离开
We need to leave before they find us.

518
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:43,520
在轮到我们钉在十字架上之前
Before it's our turn to look down from Golgotha.

519
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,200
你得休息了
You need to rest.

520
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:56,500
这段时期非常紧张
It's been a stressful period.

521
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:58,900
而你在安抚民众上
You've done exceptionally well

522
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:01,870
做得非常出色
to steer the community to calmer waters.

523
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:06,180
离不开你一如既往的支持
With your support, as ever.

524
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:09,010
你很好地利用了彼拉多来保护我们
You've used Pilate to great effect to protect us.

525
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,680
来睡觉吧
Come to bed.

526
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,190
我马上就好
I won't be long.

527
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:28,670
他犯了亵渎神明之罪
The charge is blasphemy.

528
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,870
应当处死!
He deserves to die!

529
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:42,680
真理?
Truth?

530
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:46,520
何为真理?
What is truth?

531
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,750
我不认识他!
I don't know him!

532
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:53,560
你们认错人了!
You're mistaken!

533
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,730
我没见过他!
I've never seen him before!

534
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:42,070
罗马封条被打破了
The Roman seal has been broken.

535
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:44,850
墓地门户大开 拿撒勒人...
The tomb is now opened and the Nazarene...

536
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,110
不见了
is gone.

537
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:49,460
"不见了"是什么意思?
What do you mean "gone"?

538
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:54,920
拿撒勒人...
The Nazarene...

539
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,640
不见了
is gone.

540
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,800
"不见了"是什么意思?
What do you mean "gone"?

541
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,880
你相信他是死而复生吗?
Do you believe he's risen from the dead?

542
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:04,740
这是他保证会发生的事
This is what he promised would happen.

543
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:09,680
我们不能眼睁睁看着兄弟姐妹受苦
We cannot watch as our brothers and sisters suffer.

544
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,680
宣扬他的教义
Spread his word.

545
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:14,740
神的国度将要降临
The Kingdom of God is coming.

546
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,600
我必须想个办法阻止他们
I have to find a way to stop them.

547
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,250
我以此全权委托于你 必要的话 可以不择手段
This gives you my full authority. Do whatever is necessary.

548
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,410
时机已成熟
The time has come.

549
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:25,920
谢谢你杀光了他们

550
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:27,940
您在此 我们信仰您
You are there to believe.
