That was a harsh stop.

00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,870

- Happens all the time. - Not like that.

It'll start up again any minute.

00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,710

That's weird, there's no passengers in the next car.

6
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,670
×ÖÄ»
We're locked in.

00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,670
×ÖÄ»
What?

8
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,669
×ÖÄ»
It's locked here too.

9
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,070

What the hell is going on?

10
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,649
×ÖÄ»
We'll start up again soon right guys?

11
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,523

Careful kid you could hurt yourself.

12
00:05:20,246 --> 00:05:21,649

How many times did we get stuck on the trains every week,

13
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,019
×ÖÄ»
it's gotta be nothing.

14
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,493
×ÖÄ»
Empty cars maybe, but locked doors?

15
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,699
×ÖÄ»
Maybe 'cause we're stopped.

16
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,963
×ÖÄ»
Forget it, we're between stops.

17
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,043
×ÖÄ»
Maybe if we just give it a minute.

18
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,400
×ÖÄ»
Hey,

19
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,540
×ÖÄ»
you know what's going on don't you?

20
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:49,213
×ÖÄ»
Yeah, as a matter of fact I do.

21
00:05:50,945 --> 00:05:52,373
×ÖÄ»
Then why don't you say something?

22
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,753
×ÖÄ»
I like to see what I'm dealing with first.

23
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,740

O-kay.

26
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,889

No one leaves this train until I let you.

27
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,303
×ÖÄ»
Why won't you let us?

28
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,873
×ÖÄ»
Because kid, we got a demon in our midst.

29
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,293
×ÖÄ»
And it could be any one of you.

30
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:30,379

Don't get too close partner, that includes her.

31
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,009

Her?

32
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,010
×ÖÄ»
Please.

33
00:06:35,104 --> 00:06:37,273
×ÖÄ»
The fact is there's demons all around us.

34
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,043
×ÖÄ»
My job's to seek them out.

35
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,233
×ÖÄ»
Okay whack-a-nuts,

36
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,433
×ÖÄ»
you know, I'm open, I'm open to it.

37
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:58,369
×ÖÄ»
I've been doing this a long time folks.

38
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,789
×ÖÄ»
I'm damn good at it.

39
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,970
×ÖÄ»
Demons, huh?

40
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,153
×ÖÄ»
I don't know how you expect any of us to believe you Max.

41
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,783
×ÖÄ»
Mac. That's Mac.

42
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,523
×ÖÄ»
I know you've all seen things beyond the usual,

43
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,163
×ÖÄ»
out of the realm of science, beyond our comprehension,

44
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,583
×ÖÄ»
the supernatural,

45
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,507
×ÖÄ»
that's what drew me to you.

46
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,913
×ÖÄ»
Yeah, that's what I thought.

47
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,419
×ÖÄ»
You've all seen things and yet,

48
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,209
×ÖÄ»
you still don't think there's even a chance

49
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,389
×ÖÄ»
that a demon exists on this train.

50
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,703
×ÖÄ»
It's probably you.

51
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,233
×ÖÄ»
No, not me.

52
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,079
×ÖÄ»
Quite the opposite in fact,

53
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,003
×ÖÄ»
I'm what you call a demon hunter.

54
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:01,069
×ÖÄ»
I got the ability to feel a demon's presence

55
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,073
×ÖÄ»
and contain it.

56
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,629
×ÖÄ»
The problem with these supernatural encounters is

57
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,583
×ÖÄ»
they shield who's who and what's what,

58
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:12,433
×ÖÄ»
all those memories, they look the same.

59
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,159
×ÖÄ»
But I can tell when you're all going to be

60
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,093
×ÖÄ»
in the same place so I make sure I'm there to grab a lot of you.

61
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,690
×ÖÄ»
Couldn't have timed it any better

62
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,390
×ÖÄ»
but then again, that's what I do.

63
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,553
×ÖÄ»
And I promise you, one of you is definitely a demon,

64
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:35,850
×ÖÄ»
but who?

65
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,249
×ÖÄ»
How long do you need to figure it out?

66
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,693
×ÖÄ»
As long as it takes,

67
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,789
×ÖÄ»
none of you would be candidates,

68
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,040
×ÖÄ»
if you didn't have a little gray in your past

69
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,813
×ÖÄ»
and one of you has a soul of absolute darkness,

70
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,590
×ÖÄ»
but who?

71
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,769
×ÖÄ»
Let's say there's a hint of truth to what you're saying,

72
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:02,293
×ÖÄ»
what happens to the demon once you find it?

73
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,303
×ÖÄ»
You can't be serious.

74
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,613
×ÖÄ»
Demon hunting is my purpose in life.

75
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,609
×ÖÄ»
I can only afford to be serious.

76
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,060
×ÖÄ»
What's with the silver tip?

77
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,536
×ÖÄ»
Insurance.

78
00:09:32,978 --> 00:09:34,749
×ÖÄ»
You know what?

79
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,309
×ÖÄ»
I think I'll start with you.

80
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,679
×ÖÄ»
What?

81
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,793
×ÖÄ»
No way, I don't want any part of this.

82
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:45,563
×ÖÄ»
Then our search is over folks, we found our demon.

83
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,933
×ÖÄ»
Fine, what are you going to do?

84
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,643
×ÖÄ»
Take a peek into your soul.

85
00:10:14,427 --> 00:10:17,073
×ÖÄ»
Ma'am, ma'am please.

86
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,789
×ÖÄ»
Read the sign child, we're closed.

87
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,279
×ÖÄ»
Please, it's an emergency, I need to see the future.

88
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,579
×ÖÄ»
I'm sorry, come back tomorrow.

89
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,743
×ÖÄ»
Tomorrow's too late.

90
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,570
×ÖÄ»
I have plans this evening.

91
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,403
×ÖÄ»
It's all I've got, it's an emergency, please.

92
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,300
×ÖÄ»
You know, I normally don't do this sort of thing.

93
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:12,979
×ÖÄ»
Thank you.

94
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,130

You're welcome, child.

95
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,403

Here, dry yourself off and then we'll get started.

96
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:42,403
×ÖÄ»
I saw the sign out front, 100% guaranteed.

97
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,419
×ÖÄ»
Is that really true?

98
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,529
×ÖÄ»
Absolutely, I pride myself on that.

99
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:51,129
×ÖÄ»
Now tell me why did you feel the need

100
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,773
×ÖÄ»
to come out here at this hour?

101
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:58,750
×ÖÄ»
I just, I have the feeling like I'm in danger you know?

102
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,419
×ÖÄ»
That something bad's gonna happen

103
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,359

and I need you to help me figure out why.

104
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,733
×ÖÄ»
What's your name, child?

105
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,929
×ÖÄ»

106
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:10,379
×ÖÄ»
I'm Madame Renee, you're safe here Tabitha.

107
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,029
×ÖÄ»
My clients are like family to me

108
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:16,369

and under no circumstances will anyone harm you under my watch.

109
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:20,979
×ÖÄ»
Now, what would you like today, a palm reading?

110
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,980
×ÖÄ»
Horoscope?

111
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,173
×ÖÄ»
Dialogue with the dead?

112
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,519
×ÖÄ»
Actually, I was hoping for a tarot reading.

113
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,569
×ÖÄ»
Ah the cards, no room for error,

114
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,403
×ÖÄ»
have you ever had one done before?

115
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,793
×ÖÄ»
No, I've never been to a psychic.

116
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,539
×ÖÄ»
I prefer fortune teller my dear,

117
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:47,540
×ÖÄ»
psychic is so scientific, so negative.

118
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,839
×ÖÄ»
Many of my friends are clients.

119
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,753
×ÖÄ»
They vouch that you've never been wrong with a reading, ever.

120
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:59,299
×ÖÄ»
You're in good hands, 100% guaranteed.

00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,059
×ÖÄ»
You see my gift comes with a great responsibility,

122
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,929
×ÖÄ»
I can't afford to be wrong,

123
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,123
×ÖÄ»
my entire reputation depends on it.

124
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,973
×ÖÄ»
Now, shall we begin?

125
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,353
×ÖÄ»
What is your question for the cards?

126
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,460
×ÖÄ»
I guess,

127
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,159
×ÖÄ»
what is this terrible feeling I have about?

128
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,441
×ÖÄ»
In order to protect you,

129
00:13:24,442 --> 00:13:26,999
×ÖÄ»
we are going to have to get to the heart of the matter.

130
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,993
×ÖÄ»
Luckily for us, the deck and I have a spiritual connection.

131
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:35,023
×ÖÄ»
See how the cards have a mind of their own?

132
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,299
×ÖÄ»
We'll do a standard cross, what has happened,

133
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,523
×ÖÄ»
what is happening and what will happen.

134
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,693
×ÖÄ»
Please Tabitha cut the deck.

135
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,923

Now we're in business.

136
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,203

10 cards,

present past future, external influences,

140
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,613
×ÖÄ»
hopes and fears.

141
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,429
×ÖÄ»
I've come to fear readings.

142
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:16,843
×ÖÄ»
You see, fortune telling is a burden.

143
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,973
×ÖÄ»
You never know if the news is going to be good or bad,

144
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:26,773
×ÖÄ»
but that's the price we pay for having our fortunes read,

145
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,610
×ÖÄ»
the truth.

146
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,699

We start with a major Arcana card, the hermit,

147
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,939
×ÖÄ»
it represents the loner, caution,

148
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:47,593
×ÖÄ»
vigilance, sound like somebody you know?

149
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,593
×ÖÄ»
Of course it does.

150
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:54,829
×ÖÄ»
Now, let's find out what your immediate challenge is,

151
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,163
×ÖÄ»
based on your question.

152
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,519
×ÖÄ»
The nine of swords.

153
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,929
×ÖÄ»
Is that bad?

154
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:08,930
×ÖÄ»
No, in your case I'll assume it means anxiety,

155
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,359
×ÖÄ»
that you need to trust your instincts,

156
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,923
×ÖÄ»
but you're doing that already.

157
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,519
×ÖÄ»
Maybe by looking into your past,

158
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,659
×ÖÄ»
the problem will reveal itself.

159
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,989
×ÖÄ»
This one friend of mine,

160
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,119
×ÖÄ»
she told me you predicted that she would have

161
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:29,120
×ÖÄ»
a major career change, she was fired three weeks later,

162
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:32,289
×ÖÄ»
she decided to open her own business.

163
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,643
×ÖÄ»
She followed her dream thanks to your reading.

164
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,419
×ÖÄ»
The greatest reward for fortune tellers

165
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,179
×ÖÄ»
that little push to greater success,

166
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,293
×ÖÄ»
I am very happy for your friend.

167
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,029
×ÖÄ»
Wonderful, the 10 of cups,

168
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,279
×ÖÄ»
it seems that in your distant past

169
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:54,880
×ÖÄ»
you grew up in a warm, loving family with true friendships

170
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,183
×ÖÄ»
and yet you are lonely now.

171
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:05,629
×ÖÄ»
Maybe that's due to your inability to trust anybody,

172
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,009
×ÖÄ»
this deficit of love in your life

173
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:12,783
×ÖÄ»
makes me assume that you are single.

174
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,933
×ÖÄ»
That's exactly right,

175
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:19,753
×ÖÄ»
but what does this have to do with my bad feeling?

176
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,420
×ÖÄ»
Did somebody ask you out recently?

177
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:30,169
×ÖÄ»
Actually, yeah, this guy I used to see at the gym,

178
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:33,909
×ÖÄ»
he talks to me sometimes, asks me out.

179
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,153
×ÖÄ»
I always say no.

180
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:42,229
×ÖÄ»
Don't fear my child, it's reversed.

181
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:46,869
×ÖÄ»
You know the death card normally doesn't mean actual death,

182
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:49,459
×ÖÄ»
that's a common misconception, in reverse

183
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,079
×ÖÄ»
it could actually mean quite the opposite.

184
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,080
×ÖÄ»
Thank God.

185
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,949
×ÖÄ»
In this case, it represents your recent past,

186
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:01,590
×ÖÄ»
it just means immobility, slow changes

187
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:06,179
×ÖÄ»
and if that's not it I'm sorry to say,

188
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,280
×ÖÄ»
it could be something more dire than that.

189
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:13,959
×ÖÄ»
It could be interpreted as a narrow escape from death,

190
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,863
×ÖÄ»
cheating death, I wonder if,

191
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,279
×ÖÄ»
tell me about that guy again.

192
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,280
×ÖÄ»
From the gym?

193
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,799
×ÖÄ»
I bumped into him another time outside, but..

194
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,409
×ÖÄ»
Maybe he's following you.

195
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:32,399
×ÖÄ»
Maybe he is the bad feeling, no need to fret

196
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,633
×ÖÄ»
we will get to the bottom of this now,

197
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:41,079
×ÖÄ»
wonderful the eight of wands, my lovely Tabitha

198
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,719
×ÖÄ»
you are in luck, your best possible outcome,

199
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,769
×ÖÄ»
brand new ideas are coming your way,

200
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:52,770
×ÖÄ»
a new love, a new journey, anything is possible.

201
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:57,049
×ÖÄ»
Now that we know the sky's the limit for you,

202
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:59,029
×ÖÄ»
why don't we find a way to get you out of

203
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:01,637
×ÖÄ»
this path of danger and onto a better one?

204
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:04,313
×ÖÄ»
Got another one for you.

205
00:18:04,314 --> 00:18:07,099
×ÖÄ»
This guy I work with, he was really down,

206
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,509
×ÖÄ»
unable to muster up the courage to ask for some

207
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,019
×ÖÄ»
promotion at work.

208
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,769
×ÖÄ»
He came to see you

209
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,959
×ÖÄ»
and you insisted the cards were clear

210
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,223
×ÖÄ»
that he should go for it.

211
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,361
×ÖÄ»
And?

212
00:18:18,362 --> 00:18:19,839
×ÖÄ»
What else?

213
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,840
×ÖÄ»
It worked.

214
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,389
×ÖÄ»
This is your second major Arcana card.

215
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:29,169
×ÖÄ»
It's the Empress and it's reversed.

216
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:32,409
×ÖÄ»
Your immediate future is filled with indecision,

217
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,069
×ÖÄ»
lack of understanding.

218
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:38,437
×ÖÄ»
There's something happening around you already, but what?

219
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,903
×ÖÄ»
Four cards left,

220
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,093
×ÖÄ»
factors affecting your situation.

221
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:53,962
×ÖÄ»
The seven of cups, there's something that you're not aware of

222
00:18:53,963 --> 00:18:55,030
×ÖÄ»
will affect you soon.

223
00:18:56,667 --> 00:18:59,953
×ÖÄ»
A secret, a lie maybe.

224
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,093
×ÖÄ»
The two of swords reversed,

225
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,419
×ÖÄ»
loss of balance in a relationship

226
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:13,059
×ÖÄ»
violent passion, misunderstanding of love,

227
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:16,069
×ÖÄ»
oh my dear child you must avoid that man.

228
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,493
×ÖÄ»
I thought it was nothing.

229
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:22,289
×ÖÄ»
Now that I think about it, I see him everywhere.

230
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,909
×ÖÄ»
I thought it was because he lives nearby,

231
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:28,249
×ÖÄ»
but I see him at restaurants, on the street.

232
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,519
×ÖÄ»
That sounds like a lot more than nothing.

233
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,953
×ÖÄ»
We must find a way to keep you safe.

234
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,933
×ÖÄ»
Good thing we have the cards to guide us.

235
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,877
×ÖÄ»
The cards never lie.

236
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,893
×ÖÄ»
This reminds me of my other friend.

237
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,899
×ÖÄ»
He said you predicted that something precious

238
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,123
×ÖÄ»
would be taken from him.

239
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:56,729
×ÖÄ»
He spent hours and hours hiding things,

240
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:01,593
×ÖÄ»
his money, valuables, all material things.

241
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,673
×ÖÄ»
He had no idea it would end up being his wife.

242
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:08,600
×ÖÄ»
I remember that man.

243
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:15,550
×ÖÄ»
He didn't believe me, he didn't listen to the cards.

244
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,453
×ÖÄ»
You believe me dear don't you?

245
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:21,710
×ÖÄ»
I do.

246
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:28,960
×ÖÄ»
Some fates aren't ours to decide I'm afraid,

247
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:32,123
×ÖÄ»
that's why I said I read fortunes with a heavy heart,

248
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,623
×ÖÄ»
but let's finish yours and find a way to help you.

249
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,720
×ÖÄ»
Two cards left.

250
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,813
×ÖÄ»
Another major Arcana card?

251
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:51,419
×ÖÄ»
Your hopes and fears, the fool.

252
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,709
×ÖÄ»
This can't be good.

253
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:56,669
×ÖÄ»
This centers around a choice you have to make and soon,

254
00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:01,253
×ÖÄ»
in your immediate future, that man wants you dead.

255
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,673
×ÖÄ»
One card left, the final outcome.

256
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,783
×ÖÄ»
Come on, flip it.

257
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,103
×ÖÄ»
Flip the card.

258
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,619
×ÖÄ»
What is it?

259
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,489
×ÖÄ»
The nine of Pentacles, reversed.

260
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:31,333
×ÖÄ»
Loss is possible, danger from thieves,

261
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:33,683
×ÖÄ»
caution,

262
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,509
×ÖÄ»
death.

263
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:44,999
×ÖÄ»
Based on your best possible outcome, you can beat this.

264
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,689
×ÖÄ»
Please, Madame Renee,

265
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:48,119
×ÖÄ»
let me stay here a little while longer,

266
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,439
×ÖÄ»
at least until the storm passes.

267
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,989
×ÖÄ»
I suppose a little while longer couldn't hurt.

268
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:58,097
×ÖÄ»
Thank you, Madame Renee, thank you.

269
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,480
×ÖÄ»
I know,

270
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,153
×ÖÄ»
why don't I do you?

271
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:26,909
×ÖÄ»
Let me read your fortune, anyone ever done that before?

272
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:27,910
×ÖÄ»
No, no.

273
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,989
×ÖÄ»
Seriously?

274
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,579
×ÖÄ»
Oh come one, you don't even know what the cards mean.

275
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,429
×ÖÄ»
I'll deal, you explain,

276
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,880
×ÖÄ»
what else are we going to do?

277
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:52,459
×ÖÄ»
You said what you gave me before was all that you had.

278
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,483
×ÖÄ»
Yeah, and a good thing too.

279
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:07,789
×ÖÄ»
I mean right, what else are we gonna do?

280
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,353
×ÖÄ»
We'll treat it like a lesson.

281
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,129
×ÖÄ»
Always wanted to try this.

282
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:22,309
×ÖÄ»
What are you doing with $400 cash in your purse anyway?

283
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:24,833
×ÖÄ»
No uh, we're doing you now,

284
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,543
×ÖÄ»
cut the deck right?

285
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:43,483
×ÖÄ»
Okay, so I start with inside of the cross?

286
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:47,223
×ÖÄ»
Oh no, like this child.

287
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:51,170
×ÖÄ»
Right.

288
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,389
×ÖÄ»
The magician and the present,

289
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:21,390
×ÖÄ»
represents creativity, skill, willpower, confidence.

290
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:26,620
×ÖÄ»
Sounds about right, 100% guaranteed of course.

291
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,893
×ÖÄ»
The two of Pentacles,

292
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,309
×ÖÄ»
I'm able to handle multiple problems,

293
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:40,763
×ÖÄ»
taking on a new task could be difficult.

294
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:45,013
×ÖÄ»
Expect a helpful message.

295
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,193
×ÖÄ»
Is Madame Renee stressed out?

296
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,673
×ÖÄ»
Aren't we all.

297
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:56,713
×ÖÄ»
Hey, maybe this reading will help you.

298
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:00,399
×ÖÄ»
Yeah, maybe.

299
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,653
×ÖÄ»
Okay, distant past is next, right?

300
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,013
×ÖÄ»
The eight of cups, reversed.

301
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:14,199
×ÖÄ»
Abandonment of one's original path.

302
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,873
×ÖÄ»
Disappointment in love,

303
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,169
×ÖÄ»
complaining without...

304
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:21,273
×ÖÄ»
Something wrong?

305
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:26,923
×ÖÄ»
No, complaining without cause,

306
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:31,873
×ÖÄ»
the desire to leave one's success for something better.

307
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:35,399
×ÖÄ»
Remember that friend I told you about,

308
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,583
×ÖÄ»
the one you predicted would have a career change and got fired?

309
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,619
×ÖÄ»
Turns out she lost a flash drive

310
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:44,689
×ÖÄ»
with a big presentation on it, prepped it for months

311
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:49,690
×ÖÄ»
for some big account, it just disappeared,

312
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:53,339
×ÖÄ»
fired on the spot, ruined the entire company.

313
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,389
×ÖÄ»
But you said that you found a new, better job.

314
00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:00,099
×ÖÄ»
Yeah but her startup went under soon after,

315
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:04,233
×ÖÄ»
the fortune was right, just unfortunate that's all.

316
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:11,209
×ÖÄ»
The strength card reversed.

317
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:14,449
×ÖÄ»
That's the second major Arcana card, right?

318
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:17,669
×ÖÄ»
I guess it means weakness,

319
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:19,599
×ÖÄ»
since it's facing the wrong way.

320
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,143
×ÖÄ»
Lack of faith, tyranny,

321
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,773
×ÖÄ»
abuse of power,

322
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:29,679
×ÖÄ»
strength.

323
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:34,680
×ÖÄ»
I think yes, this has to do with someone I used to know.

324
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:35,873
×ÖÄ»
Someone you know?

325
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,553
×ÖÄ»
Okay, now we're in business.

326
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,273
×ÖÄ»
Best possible outcome is next.

327
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,559
×ÖÄ»
The hanged man.

328
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,399
×ÖÄ»
Another major Arcana card?

329
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,629
×ÖÄ»
I think you're going for the world record.

330
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:54,859
×ÖÄ»
But we're not even halfway through yet, that's impossible.

331
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:59,779
×ÖÄ»
- The odds are... - The cards never lie, best possible outcome,

332
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,519
×ÖÄ»
change, reversal, abandonment,

333
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,979
×ÖÄ»
sacrifice, improvement, rebirth.

334
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,583
×ÖÄ»
What is this?

335
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:11,019
×ÖÄ»
Who are you and what are you doing here?

336
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,383
×ÖÄ»
I'm just reading your fortune Madame Renee,

337
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,553
×ÖÄ»
immediate future is next.

338
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:22,779
×ÖÄ»
10 of swords, sudden misfortune, the ruining of plans,

339
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:25,639
×ÖÄ»
defeat, failure, pain.

340
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,869
×ÖÄ»
This is the worst fortune I've ever seen.

341
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:31,619
×ÖÄ»
What do you want from me?

342
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,559
×ÖÄ»
Why are you doing this to me?

343
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,603
×ÖÄ»
Four cards left,

344
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:41,689
×ÖÄ»
the queen of swords, a quick and confident decision.

345
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,809
×ÖÄ»
Someone who can bear their sorrow,

346
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:47,569
×ÖÄ»
remember that other story I told you

347
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:49,489
×ÖÄ»
about the guy I work with?

348
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:53,969
×ÖÄ»
Of course you do, he was competing for that promotion.

349
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:56,579
×ÖÄ»
Soon after your reading his competition,

350
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,859
×ÖÄ»
mysteriously went missing,

351
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,219
×ÖÄ»
doesn't change that you were right,

352
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:04,433
×ÖÄ»
just strange how it all happened.

353
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:08,163
×ÖÄ»
External influences already?

354
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:15,630
×ÖÄ»
Oh look, the page of swords, so many swords.

355
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,649
×ÖÄ»
We're done here, get out of my shop.

356
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:21,749
×ÖÄ»
Now, now child, you know it's bad luck to stop

357
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,359
×ÖÄ»
in the middle of a reading,

358
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,479
×ÖÄ»
besides how can we ever solve your problems?

359
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,139
×ÖÄ»
Outside forces you can't control,

360
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:33,369
×ÖÄ»
an imposter, an unexpected event.

361
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:34,370
×ÖÄ»
You.

362
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:38,299
×ÖÄ»
Two cards left,

363
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,853
×ÖÄ»
hopes and fears.

364
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,679
×ÖÄ»
Impossible.

365
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,319
×ÖÄ»
Will you look at that.

366
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,159
×ÖÄ»
Another major Arcana card,

367
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,969
×ÖÄ»
the Moon, deception, trickery,

368
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,693
×ÖÄ»
danger, disgrace.

369
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:04,550
×ÖÄ»
Cards, 22 major Arcana

370
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:07,678
×ÖÄ»
... 10 cards in the cross

371
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,059
×ÖÄ»
four major Arcana cards, that's almost half.

372
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,703
×ÖÄ»
That last story I told you,

373
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:16,889
×ÖÄ»
about the man you predicted would lose something.

374
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:21,890
×ÖÄ»
He wasn't just some friend, he was my sister's husband

375
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:25,529
×ÖÄ»
and you murdered her to make your fortune true.

376
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:29,539
×ÖÄ»
You're not a fortune teller, you're a fortune maker.

377
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:32,319
×ÖÄ»
You tell fortunes and you keep your reputation

378
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,389
×ÖÄ»
by making sure they come true,

379
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:39,390
×ÖÄ»
no matter what the cost, 100% guaranteed.

380
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:43,949
×ÖÄ»
That's right, I'm a fraud,

381
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:48,950
×ÖÄ»
those cards are random pictures, art, they mean nothing.

382
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,179
×ÖÄ»
That's where you're wrong Madame Renee,

383
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:55,090
×ÖÄ»
you might be a fraud, but the cards

384
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,693
×ÖÄ»
are very, very real,

385
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:03,080
×ÖÄ»
at least as long as someone like me is handling them.

386
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:08,499
×ÖÄ»
So many fortune tellers try to make their clients

387
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,249
×ÖÄ»
feel better by saying the death card

388
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,669
×ÖÄ»
doesn't really mean they're gonna die.

389
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:16,303
×ÖÄ»
The truth is, it usually does.

390
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,283
×ÖÄ»
Time to make your fortune come true.

391
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:06,979
×ÖÄ»
So wait, are you telling us

392
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,089
×ÖÄ»
Tabitha murdered Madame Renee?

393
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:11,679
×ÖÄ»
I didn't murder anyone,

394
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,769
×ÖÄ»
but I can't stop the spirits from casting their revenge,

395
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:18,589
×ÖÄ»
I'm just the messenger, a medium.

396
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,383
×ÖÄ»
Yeah well she still died,

397
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,150
×ÖÄ»
Mac told it to us all the same.

398
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:27,480
×ÖÄ»
Yeah but it's not like she didn't come at her with a knife guys.

399
00:31:27,481 --> 00:31:29,079
×ÖÄ»
Right, self-defense.

400
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,499
×ÖÄ»
Yeah but Tabitha didn't have to show up at all.

401
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,279
×ÖÄ»
Madame Renee trusted her, took her in.

402
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,830
×ÖÄ»
For a hell of a lot of money.

403
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:41,110
×ÖÄ»
Wait Tabitha, so if you're a psychic and can see the future

404
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:44,205
×ÖÄ»
which one of them is the demon?

405
00:31:44,206 --> 00:31:46,406
×ÖÄ»
It doesn't work that way, I need my cards.

406
00:31:49,084 --> 00:31:51,029
×ÖÄ»
Are you sure of what you saw demon hunter,

407
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,399
×ÖÄ»
what you're telling us?

408
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,270
×ÖÄ»
I told it just as I saw it

409
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,939
×ÖÄ»
as she saw it,

410
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:57,983
×ÖÄ»
I can't just,

411
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,303
×ÖÄ»
it's like watching TV,

412
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,809
×ÖÄ»
I can see and hear experiences,

413
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:05,877
×ÖÄ»
but I can't be sure of anyone's intent.

414
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,780
×ÖÄ»
I think he's making this shit up.

415
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,289
×ÖÄ»
What he saw was true.

416
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:14,809
×ÖÄ»
Why admit to that?

417
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:16,710
×ÖÄ»
That made you look pretty bad Tabitha.

418
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:22,043
×ÖÄ»
Yeah exactly, because no one in their right mind would,

419
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,879
×ÖÄ»
it also proves I'm not the demon.

420
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,429
×ÖÄ»
No, it doesn't.

421
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,679
×ÖÄ»
Maybe you and Mac are working together,

422
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,749
×ÖÄ»
acting like your story checks out when

423
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,789
×ÖÄ»
you're really a plant.

424
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:35,779
×ÖÄ»
Oh please, this guy knew something about me

425
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,323
×ÖÄ»
that nobody possibly could.

426
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,203
×ÖÄ»
You're saying he's for real then.

427
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:45,033
×ÖÄ»
Yeah, he's for real.

428
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,353
×ÖÄ»
Is Tabitha the demon, Mac?

429
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:51,570
×ÖÄ»
I don't know

430
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:56,889
×ÖÄ»
and I won't until I looked through every one of your souls,

431
00:32:56,890 --> 00:33:01,890
×ÖÄ»
one by one, the answer always reveals itself.

432
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,533
×ÖÄ»
I've never been wrong.

433
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:08,089
×ÖÄ»
I don't think you're a demon.

434
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:09,090
×ÖÄ»
Thanks, kid.
