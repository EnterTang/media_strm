1
00:00:02,014 --> 00:00:05,000
我们希望能进入神殿并获得尊敬
We wish to sit in the temple and win respect.

2
00:00:05,002 --> 00:00:07,869
我相信以后 你们会记住我的慷慨大方
I trust you will remember my generosity in the days to come.

3
00:00:07,871 --> 00:00:10,505
代表我供万人瞻仰
My likeness in the temple for all to see.

4
00:00:10,507 --> 00:00:14,743
对抗这可憎之物 保卫他的神殿!
Defend his temple against this abomination!

5
00:00:14,745 --> 00:00:18,247
我们点起了一团火 将会把罗马烧成灰烬
We are lighting a fire that will burn Rome to cinders.

6
00:00:18,249 --> 00:00:19,715
去找彼拉多
Go to Pilate.

7
00:00:19,717 --> 00:00:22,784
- 把这座城市从罗马人的屠杀中拯救出来  - 绝不!
- Save this city from a Roman massacre.  - Never!

8
00:00:22,786 --> 00:00:25,287
狂热分子和埃塞俄比亚人结盟了
The zealots have formed an alliance with Ethiopia.

9
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:29,625
计划发动一场巨大的暴动
They plan to launch a huge uprising against Rome.

10
00:00:29,627 --> 00:00:30,926
走开!
Move aside!

11
00:00:30,928 --> 00:00:32,928
我们被出卖了 快拿!
We are betrayed. Quick!

12
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,863
别管埃塞俄比亚的武器了 我们自己还有
Forget the Ethiopians' weapons. We still have our own.

13
00:00:34,865 --> 00:00:36,098
约亚拿 跟我来
Joanna, come with me.

14
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,967
她会被处死 克劳迪娅
She will be put to death, Claudia.

15
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:40,269
哥尼流 行刑
Cornelius, begin.

16
00:00:42,173 --> 00:00:44,206
就到此为止吧
This ends here.

大帝的雕像

28
00:01:05,529 --> 00:01:07,496
送来了
It's here.

29
00:01:16,006 --> 00:01:17,873
好吧 现在...
Well, now...

30
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:19,141
它就在这了
Here it is.

31
00:01:19,143 --> 00:01:20,275
你想怎样?
What do you want?

32
00:01:20,277 --> 00:01:21,710
等我下了命令
When I decree it,

33
00:01:21,712 --> 00:01:24,146
就把雕像护送进神殿
the statue will be escorted to the temple.

34
00:01:24,148 --> 00:01:27,383
就安放在妇人院内
There it shall be placed in the Court of the Women,

35
00:01:27,385 --> 00:01:30,386
除非我有新的命令 否则将一直放在那里
and there it shall remain until I tell you otherwise.

36
00:01:30,388 --> 00:01:31,887
巡抚...
Governor...

37
00:01:31,889 --> 00:01:34,957
唯一不确定的只是死亡人数
The only uncertainty regards the number of deaths.

38
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:37,059
这就取决于你的作用了
And that's where you become useful.

39
00:01:37,061 --> 00:01:38,394
我们帮不了你
We cannot help you.

40
00:01:39,463 --> 00:01:42,531
我还以为我们是朋友呢
And I thought we were friends.

41
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:45,701
你的妻子和我是朋友 对吧?
Your wife and I are friends. Aren't we?

42
00:01:48,338 --> 00:01:50,472
你知不知道你的妻子...
Do you know that your wife...

43
00:01:50,474 --> 00:01:51,740
他在胡说八道
He's lying.

44
00:01:51,742 --> 00:01:55,210
你的妻子...
Your wife...

45
00:01:55,212 --> 00:01:56,545
来找我
came to me

46
00:01:56,547 --> 00:02:00,716
揭发了埃塞俄比亚和狂热分子
and helped me expose a conspiracy

47
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:03,652
勾结的阴谋?
between Ethiopia and the zealots?

48
00:02:05,755 --> 00:02:07,389
这是我们之间的小秘密
It's our little secret.

49
00:02:07,391 --> 00:02:10,459
我对你感激不尽
And I am in your debt.

50
00:02:10,461 --> 00:02:13,162
不过看她刚才的样子...
But her outburst just now...

51
00:02:13,164 --> 00:02:14,496
倒让我怀疑
makes me wonder.

52
00:02:15,865 --> 00:02:20,169
你是不是毫不知情?
Were you not aware of this?

53
00:02:20,171 --> 00:02:24,073
也许我压根不欠你人情
Maybe I owe you nothing after all.

54
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:38,921
我妻子...
My wife...

55
00:02:38,923 --> 00:02:42,424
向你报信这事我知情而且允许了
delivered this information with my knowledge and approval.

56
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,529
但我本人和她的所作所为毫无关系
But I myself am untainted by her actions,

57
00:02:47,531 --> 00:02:48,897
所以你不用谢我
so there is no debt.

58
00:02:48,899 --> 00:02:51,367
不过同时你也没有任何方法
But you also have no means

59
00:02:51,369 --> 00:02:54,236
可以胁迫我 或者胁迫神殿
by which to blackmail me or the temple,

60
00:02:54,238 --> 00:02:56,171
我看这就是你今天叫我来的
which seems to me to be the true purpose

61
00:02:56,173 --> 00:02:57,940
主要目的吧
of our conversation today.

62
00:02:57,942 --> 00:03:02,544
你在这没有同盟 你贿赂不了谁也欺凌不了谁
You have no allies here, no one to bribe or bully.

63
00:03:05,348 --> 00:03:08,317
这雕像绝对不可能进入神殿一步
And the statue will never, ever enter the temple.

64
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,053
想得挺美
So you say.

65
00:03:11,055 --> 00:03:15,691
但到时候我的军队一开进
But when it comes to it and my men march toward you,

66
00:03:15,693 --> 00:03:18,027
你还有什么能耐?
how will you stop us?

67
00:03:27,804 --> 00:03:29,204
我们得离开耶路撒冷
We need to get out of Jerusalem.

68
00:03:29,206 --> 00:03:31,707
你为什么要放弃神殿?
Why would you abandon the temple?

69
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:33,676
因为耶稣已经警告过我们
Because Jesus warned us.

70
00:03:33,678 --> 00:03:35,811
"这都是灾难的起头"
"These are the beginnings of sorrows."

71
00:03:35,813 --> 00:03:38,013
到时候神殿一片瓦
Won't be a single stone of the temple

72
00:03:38,015 --> 00:03:39,181
也剩不下 西门
left standing, Simon.

73
00:03:39,183 --> 00:03:40,683
记得他怎么跟我们说的
Remember what he told us.

74
00:03:40,685 --> 00:03:42,918
"多处必有地震 饥荒"
"There will be earthquakes and famine and troubles."

75
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,787
所以我们该收拾一下去山里
So we should pack up and go to the hills.

76
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:47,289
没错 就这么做
Yes. Let's do that.

77
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:50,859
罗马人要让耶路撒冷去朝拜一个假神像
The Romans are about to make Jerusalem worship a false idol.

78
00:03:50,861 --> 00:03:52,962
这已经不再是我们的斗争了
It's not our fight... not anymore.

79
00:03:52,964 --> 00:03:54,930
谁来了?
Who was that?

80
00:03:54,932 --> 00:03:56,632
大祭司派来的信使
A messenger from the high priest.

81
00:03:56,634 --> 00:03:58,200
说什么了?
Saying what?

82
00:03:58,202 --> 00:04:00,336
只说他想见我
Just that he wants to see me.

83
00:04:00,338 --> 00:04:02,404
恰好在雕像来的这天?
On the same day that the statue arrives?

84
00:04:02,406 --> 00:04:03,472
他想让我们为他而战
He wants us to fight for him.

85
00:04:03,474 --> 00:04:05,207
有何不可?
And why wouldn't we?

86
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:07,343
因为他们会把我们撕成碎片
Because they will cut us to pieces.

87
00:04:07,345 --> 00:04:10,179
他说要给我们圣殿的时候 我们干嘛相信他?
Why did we believe him when he offered us sanctuary?

88
00:04:10,181 --> 00:04:13,582
他总是在找机会利用我们
He was always just waiting for a chance to use us.

89
00:04:13,584 --> 00:04:14,750
也许不一定
We don't know that.

90
00:04:14,752 --> 00:04:17,386
一切尚未可知
Not yet.

91
00:04:25,997 --> 00:04:31,066
奉基督的名 我饶恕你
In the name of Christ, I forgive you.

92
00:04:46,249 --> 00:04:48,817
哥尼流...
Cornelius...

93
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:53,222
神慈悲你的悲伤与悔改
God has looked kindly on your sorrow and repentance.

94
00:04:53,224 --> 00:04:56,058
打发人往约帕去 请彼得来
Send men to Joppa and find a man called Peter,

95
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,260
他住在海边一个硝皮匠西门的家里
who is staying with Simon the Tanner, near the sea.

96
00:05:08,071 --> 00:05:09,972
彼得
Peter.

97
00:05:09,974 --> 00:05:12,007
这些都被视为不洁
These are looked upon as unclean.

98
00:05:15,446 --> 00:05:21,150
神所洁净的 你不可当作俗物
But do not call anything impure that God has cleansed.

99
00:05:30,761 --> 00:05:32,561
有三个人来找你
There are three men downstairs.

100
00:05:32,563 --> 00:05:34,196
他们在楼下
They have come for you.

101
00:05:34,198 --> 00:05:35,898
起来 下去 和他们同往
Go with them.

102
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,101
不要疑惑 因为是我差他们来的
Don't be afraid, because I have sent them.

103
00:05:45,075 --> 00:05:47,876
彼得
Peter.

104
00:05:47,878 --> 00:05:50,212
有人在楼下
There are men downstairs.

105
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,152
你笑什么?
Why are you smiling?

106
00:06:26,707 --> 00:06:28,141
你是彼得
You're Peter.

107
00:06:28,143 --> 00:06:29,542
是的
I am.

108
00:06:31,212 --> 00:06:34,047
我见到了...
I had a...

109
00:06:34,049 --> 00:06:35,648
我不... 我不知道该怎么说...
I'm not... I'm not sure what I should call it...

110
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:36,683
那不是梦
Not a dream.

111
00:06:36,685 --> 00:06:38,551
我很清醒 但是...
I was awake, but...

112
00:06:38,553 --> 00:06:40,086
我来这里是...
I was visited...

113
00:06:40,088 --> 00:06:43,089
有人派我...
by...

114
00:06:43,091 --> 00:06:45,158
我不知该如何称呼他
an I know not what.

115
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,226
那是天使
An angel.

116
00:06:48,662 --> 00:06:50,163
然后... 我听到了你的名字
And... and I heard your name.

117
00:06:51,866 --> 00:06:58,171
我曾目睹和参与了许多恶行
I have been a witness and party to many terrible deeds.

118
00:07:02,476 --> 00:07:04,344
我看着耶稣死了
I saw your Jesus die.

119
00:07:06,447 --> 00:07:08,748
而这双手也...
And these hands have...

120
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,952
我的理智...
My mind...

121
00:07:12,954 --> 00:07:15,622
我的内心...
My heart...

122
00:07:15,624 --> 00:07:17,023
都在呐喊"够了"
screams, "enough."

123
00:07:17,025 --> 00:07:19,692
我的朋友约亚拿...
My friend Joanna...

124
00:07:21,328 --> 00:07:23,096
她怎么样了?
How is she?

125
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:54,928
你杀了她
You killed her.

126
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,129
是吗?
Didn't you?

127
00:08:17,785 --> 00:08:19,419
站起来
Stand up.

128
00:08:19,421 --> 00:08:22,055
不要在我面前跪下
Don't kneel before me.

129
00:08:22,057 --> 00:08:24,858
我也是人...
I'm just a man...

130
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,159
和你一样
like you.

131
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:35,101
谢谢你这么快来
Thank you for coming so swiftly.

132
00:08:35,103 --> 00:08:38,605
因为是大祭司召唤...
Well, when the High Priest calls...

133
00:08:38,607 --> 00:08:41,074
我在神殿那看到你一些兄弟
I've seen some of your brethren at the temple.

134
00:08:41,076 --> 00:08:44,511
他们满心的喜悦让人感觉...
Their delight has been...

135
00:08:44,513 --> 00:08:45,745
很温暖
heartwarming.

136
00:08:47,715 --> 00:08:50,083
- 你知道雕像的事?  - 是的 当然
- You know about the statue?  - Yes, of course.

137
00:08:50,085 --> 00:08:53,653
听着 我想集全城之力来对抗这个可憎之物
See, I am trying to unite the city against this abomination,

138
00:08:53,655 --> 00:08:56,890
而且我相信 要是我们先把分歧放在一边
and I believe that if we all put our differences aside

139
00:08:56,892 --> 00:09:00,760
团结一致 就一定能反抗暴行
and stand as one, then we can repel this barbarity.

140
00:09:00,762 --> 00:09:04,764
这个想法很高尚
Well, that is certainly a noble intention.

141
00:09:04,766 --> 00:09:09,269
但是 我们帮不上忙
But, um, we cannot help.

142
00:09:10,971 --> 00:09:14,741
不好意思
I'm sorry.

143
00:09:14,743 --> 00:09:16,109
我让你们回来
I let you back in.

144
00:09:16,111 --> 00:09:18,111
我保障了你们的安全
I... I offered you safety.

145
00:09:18,113 --> 00:09:20,113
那似乎是有条件的
With hidden conditions, it seems.

146
00:09:20,115 --> 00:09:22,248
哦 这么说你们就不欠我人情了?
Oh, so suddenly you owe me nothing?

147
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,683
那神殿呢?
What about the temple?

148
00:09:23,685 --> 00:09:27,354
在那个耶稣出现之前 你们难道不是把神殿
The building which, until this Jesus appeared,

149
00:09:27,356 --> 00:09:28,722
看作宇宙的中心?
was the center of your universe?

150
00:09:28,724 --> 00:09:30,957
- 你一点感觉都没有吗?  - 当然有
- Do you feel nothing for it?  - Of course I do.

151
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,094
但是现在我信仰耶稣
But I worship Jesus now.

152
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,935
我要拆散你的家庭
I will split you from your loved ones

153
00:09:41,937 --> 00:09:44,938
我要把追随你们的人 还有他们的孩子
and will drive your followers and their children

154
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,406
都赶到荒野
into the wilderness.

155
00:09:46,408 --> 00:09:49,776
我会打击你们 鞭打你们 用石头砸你们
I will beat and flog and stone you all.

156
00:09:49,778 --> 00:09:51,644
谁也逃不了
No one will escape.

157
00:09:51,646 --> 00:09:54,347
你这么快就改口威胁我了
How quickly you slip into threats.

158
00:09:54,349 --> 00:09:56,249
看来他们对你的看法是对的
They were right about you after all.

159
00:09:56,251 --> 00:09:58,385
不 不!
No. No!

160
00:09:58,387 --> 00:10:02,622
我想拯救我们的城市!
I am trying to save our city!

161
00:10:02,624 --> 00:10:06,893
而你们只关心自己!
But you have no interest in anything but yourselves!

162
00:10:08,429 --> 00:10:10,397
滚出去
Get out.

163
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,665
滚出去!
Get out!

164
00:10:35,122 --> 00:10:36,956
你觉得彼拉多察觉到了吗?
Do you think Pilate noticed?

165
00:10:38,426 --> 00:10:39,993
我做了我该做的事
I did what I had to.

166
00:10:39,995 --> 00:10:42,829
我觉得他看穿我了
I think he saw through me.

167
00:10:45,433 --> 00:10:48,268
他发现我控制不了我妻子...
He realized that I have no control over my wife...

168
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,236
她当我的面说谎...
that she lies to my face...

169
00:10:50,238 --> 00:10:51,571
总要有人来做决定
Someone had to make the decision.

170
00:10:51,573 --> 00:10:53,173
背着我搞事
goes behind my back.

171
00:10:53,175 --> 00:10:55,175
总要有人去做
It had to be done.

172
00:10:55,177 --> 00:10:59,412
要是彼拉多把你做的事捅给那些狂热分子怎么办?!
What would happen if Pilate told the zealots what you did?!

173
00:10:59,414 --> 00:11:00,847
他们会杀了我
They would kill me.

174
00:11:02,451 --> 00:11:05,919
神殿会很危险
The temple would be endangered.

175
00:11:05,921 --> 00:11:07,620
神殿啊 利亚!
The temple, Leah!

176
00:11:09,324 --> 00:11:13,426
谁在乎你 在乎一个人 在乎一个家庭?
Who cares about you, about an individual, a family?

177
00:11:13,428 --> 00:11:15,128
你比拿撒勒人好不到哪里去
You're no better than the Nazarenes.

178
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:16,763
我这么做是为我们好
I did it for us.

179
00:11:16,765 --> 00:11:18,832
你这么做伤了我的心
And you broke my heart in the process.

180
00:11:21,402 --> 00:11:22,669
回家去
Go home.

181
00:11:22,671 --> 00:11:24,738
从现在开始你只能呆在那
From now on, you will stay there.

182
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,173
你以后就是我名义上的妻子
You are a wife to me in name only.

183
00:11:27,175 --> 00:11:30,110
就是个称呼...
You're just a name...

184
00:11:30,112 --> 00:11:32,212
一个影子
a shadow.

185
00:11:32,214 --> 00:11:38,051
没有我 你根本当不上大祭司
Without me, you would never be High Priest.

186
00:11:38,053 --> 00:11:40,153
- 没有我的家族...  - 别说了
- Without my family...  - Stop talking.

187
00:11:40,155 --> 00:11:43,356
没人想听
No one's listening.

188
00:11:52,233 --> 00:11:54,567
我需要知道神对我的旨意
I have to know God's plan for me.

189
00:11:54,569 --> 00:11:55,802
他跟你说了什么?
What has he told you?

190
00:11:55,804 --> 00:11:56,903
神说了什么?
What has God told me?

191
00:11:56,905 --> 00:11:59,339
我不确定
I'm not sure.

192
00:11:59,341 --> 00:12:00,540
我只是个渔夫
I'm just a fisherman.

193
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:05,612
但神授意我将他的道
But I've been commanded to preach his message

194
00:12:05,614 --> 00:12:07,914
传遍世界的每个角落
to the ends of the earth,

195
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:12,152
而我现在看到你似乎也找到了
and now I see that you may also find the salvation

196
00:12:12,154 --> 00:12:13,787
耶稣的救赎
that Jesus offers.

197
00:12:13,789 --> 00:12:16,222
所以如果我一定要做点什么
So if I am to do this,

198
00:12:16,224 --> 00:12:18,725
那我只能欢迎你 然后...
then I must welcome you and...

199
00:12:18,727 --> 00:12:20,327
为你施洗
baptize you.

200
00:13:03,537 --> 00:13:05,338
这就是我们来这的原因!
This is why we came!

201
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,474
这就是我们的使命!
This is our mission!

202
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:39,417
我还以为我女儿已经把我们忘了
There was me, thinking my daughter had forgotten us.

203
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,119
我向你道歉
I apologize.

204
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:45,524
我很担心我的丈夫
I'm worried about my husband.

205
00:13:45,526 --> 00:13:49,261
我觉得他肩上的担子会...
I think the burden of his office has...

206
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:50,662
把他压垮
overwhelmed him.

207
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:53,465
他变得不可理喻 有时很暴力
He's become irrational, sometimes violent.

208
00:13:53,467 --> 00:13:57,436
他的行为已经无法匹配
He no longer behaves in a way

209
00:13:57,438 --> 00:14:00,305
大祭司的职位了
befitting the role of High Priest.

210
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:02,240
那你想让我做什么呢?
And what would you have me do about it?

211
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:03,942
神殿不再安全
Well, the temple is no longer safe.

212
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:07,012
需要你来稳住大局
It needs your stable influence.

213
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:10,182
你想让我们赶该亚法下台?
You want us to remove Caiaphas from office?

214
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:13,485
我觉得这对家族有利
I think it would be in our family's interest.

215
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:16,021
你可怜的丈夫对你的阴谋有一丝察觉吗?
Does your poor husband have any idea of what you're plotting?

216
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:19,324
怎么 难道你不想成为大祭司?
What, do you not want to become high priest?

217
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:22,828
利亚 他在联合整个民族
He is uniting the nation, Leah.

218
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:26,832
耶路撒冷甚至周边的每个教派都团聚在他四周
Every sect in Jerusalem and beyond has flocked to his side.

219
00:14:26,834 --> 00:14:31,102
任何试图赶他下台的举动只会削弱我们的力量
Any attempt to remove him now would only weaken us all.

220
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:32,938
你害怕了
You're afraid.

221
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,606
住口
Stop it.

222
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:36,408
马上住口
Stop it now.

223
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:40,011
该亚法不能动
Caiaphas is untouchable.

224
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:44,216
除非他死了 不然没人能取代他
Only death can rob him of his position.

225
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,119
回去找你的丈夫
Go back to your husband.

226
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:49,421
这次没人能帮你
No one can help you with this.

227
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:01,166
她很危险...
She is dangerous...

228
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:02,968
已经失控了
Beyond control.

229
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:08,373
如果不小心 她会把我们都拖下水
And she'll drag us down if we're not careful.

230
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:11,276
那该拿她怎么办?
So what shall we do with her?

231
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,948
出去
Leave us.

232
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:27,492
我是犹太的巡抚
I am the Governor of Judea.

233
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:29,060
我肩负责任
I have responsibilities.

234
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:33,465
如果我抗命就会被杀 
If I refuse to do this, I will be killed,

235
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:35,801
下一任会乐意去执行命令
and a new man will gleefully do it instead.

236
00:15:35,803 --> 00:15:37,035
我也会失去你
And you'll be lost, too.

237
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:40,639
所以我别无选择!
So I have no choice!

238
00:15:42,876 --> 00:15:45,143
你到底怎么了?
What is the matter with you?

239
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:52,317
你乐在其中
You enjoy it.

240
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:57,556
是因为那个女人吗?
Is this about that woman?

241
00:15:57,558 --> 00:16:00,392
那个愚蠢的耶稣追随者?
That stupid Jesus follower?

242
00:16:00,394 --> 00:16:01,760
她什么都不是
She was nothing.

243
00:16:01,762 --> 00:16:04,930
就是个符号 是一时的愤怒...
A symbol, a moment of anger...

244
00:16:04,932 --> 00:16:07,566
是提醒你必须对我忠诚
a reminder that you must remain loyal to me.

245
00:16:07,568 --> 00:16:08,800
仅此而已
That's all.

246
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,001
这就是她全部的意义吗?
Is that all she was?

247
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:12,971
当然
Of course.

248
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:16,808
我不会再与你共进晚餐 看你洋洋自得
I will not dine with you and watch you gloat.

249
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:20,545
但你是我的妻子
But you are my wife.

250
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:25,851
你是我的妻子
You are my wife.

251
00:16:25,853 --> 00:16:29,154
现在我孤身一人与他们为敌
Now, I am fighting them all on my own,

252
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:31,022
而且我会赢
and I am winning.

253
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:35,127
但我不能同时也与你为敌
But I cannot fight against you, too.

254
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:37,395
也许你不会每次都是赢家
Maybe you cannot win every battle.

255
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:40,532
是的 我会赢
Oh, yes, I can.

256
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:58,950
你要去精心准备我们的晚餐!
You will prepare our evening in exquisite detail!

257
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:04,790
还要像往常一样美艳动人 
And you will look beautiful, as you always do.

258
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:09,361
我们在一起才会赢
And together we will win.

259
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:12,831
这就是我们的生活...
This is our life...

260
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:16,134
你的和我的...
Yours and mine...

261
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:17,502
在一起
together.

262
00:17:24,278 --> 00:17:26,545
求你了 留下来多呆几天吧
Please, stay with us for a few more days.

263
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:28,480
我们都渴望听到更多耶稣的信息
We're all eager to hear more of Jesus' words.

264
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:31,750
我觉得这个小家伙不会让我走的
I don't think this little one will let me go.

265
00:17:31,752 --> 00:17:34,119
我也不会让你走
I can't let you go, either.

266
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:36,855
我感觉如此鲜活 每寸皮肤都兴奋不已
I feel so alive. My skin prickles with it.

267
00:17:36,857 --> 00:17:39,591
我... 我无法用语言表达
I... I wish I had the words.

268
00:17:39,593 --> 00:17:42,527
我... 我内心充盈...
I'm... I feel full...

269
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:44,463
精神焕发 准备大干一番
full up, ready to burst.

270
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,501
百夫长
Centurion.

271
00:17:49,503 --> 00:17:52,437
什么事?
What is it?

272
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:55,207
- 没关系 说吧  - 你需要回到耶路撒冷...
- No, you can speak.  - You are needed back in Jerusalem...

273
00:17:55,209 --> 00:17:56,475
马上
urgently.

274
00:17:56,477 --> 00:17:57,809
为何?
Because?

275
00:17:57,811 --> 00:18:00,312
大帝的雕像到了
The statue of our emperor has arrived.

276
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:03,782
巡抚命令你
The Governor has ordered you

277
00:18:03,784 --> 00:18:07,185
确保将它安全运往神殿
to ensure its safe passage to the temple.

278
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:09,187
谢谢你
Thank you.

279
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,063
呃...
Um...

280
00:18:18,065 --> 00:18:19,364
我... 我必须回去了
I... I... I must go back.

281
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,200
我们也是
We must, too.

282
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,337
你不能这么做
You can't do it.

283
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:28,507
是的 我不能 但我是罗马人...
No, I can't, but I'm a Roman...

284
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:30,742
还是一个有命在身的士兵
and a soldier with orders.

285
00:18:30,744 --> 00:18:35,480
你已经奉基督耶稣的名受洗了
You have been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.

286
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:37,749
是的 但我仍是一名士兵
Yes, but I'm still a soldier.

287
00:18:37,751 --> 00:18:40,018
那你会怎么做?
So what will you do?

288
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,587
我会...
I will...

289
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:53,398
我会祈求圣灵引导我
I will pray that the Holy Spirit will guide me.

290
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,736
预备!
Prepare yourselves!

291
00:19:05,738 --> 00:19:06,670
开始!
Begin!

292
00:19:18,484 --> 00:19:21,351
别走
Don't go.

293
00:19:21,353 --> 00:19:22,652
你已经获得新生了
You have a new life now.

294
00:19:22,654 --> 00:19:25,922
待会我会来找你们的
I'll come and find you afterwards.

295
00:20:02,026 --> 00:20:04,027
抱歉这里发生的一切
I'm sorry for what has happened here.

296
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:07,264
我必须说出事实
I must speak the truth.

297
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,167
这事怪我
I am to blame for this.

298
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:11,301
我就知道
I knew it.

299
00:20:14,406 --> 00:20:15,739
我不知道我当时在做什么
I didn't know what I was doing.

300
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:21,345
我以为我是在保护神殿 但...
I thought I was protecting the temple, but...

301
00:20:21,347 --> 00:20:24,181
我的丈夫...
my husband...

302
00:20:24,183 --> 00:20:25,615
他不顾你们死活
he doesn't care about you.

303
00:20:25,617 --> 00:20:27,818
请原谅他
Please forgive him.

304
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,319
这么说我很伤心
It breaks my heart.

305
00:20:29,321 --> 00:20:34,057
但背叛你们的人是我丈夫
But it was my husband who betrayed you.

306
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:42,065
他在找你
He's looking for you.

307
00:20:42,067 --> 00:20:44,468
你家人怎么样?
How is your family?

308
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,236
他们很好 谢谢
They're well. Thank you.

309
00:20:48,573 --> 00:20:51,141
你准备好履行你的职责了吗?
Are you ready to carry out your duties?

310
00:20:53,811 --> 00:20:58,148
昨天有人引我去拿撒勒人的门徒那
I was led to the disciples of the Nazarene yesterday.

311
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,217
谁引你去的?
Led? By whom?

312
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:01,219
一位天使
An angel.

313
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,586
呃...
Uh...

314
00:21:02,588 --> 00:21:04,121
是真的 我发誓
It's true. I swear.

315
00:21:04,123 --> 00:21:07,391
就像梦一样 只不过我一直是清醒的
It was like a dream, except that I was always awake.

316
00:21:07,393 --> 00:21:10,694
现在我理解了他们的信仰
And I understand their faith now.

317
00:21:10,696 --> 00:21:11,928
我相信了
I believe.

318
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,330
你相信了?
You believe?

319
00:21:13,332 --> 00:21:14,531
是的
Yes.

320
00:21:14,533 --> 00:21:15,533
这么快?
So quickly?

321
00:21:15,534 --> 00:21:18,769
他们的信仰很美
It's a beautiful thing.

322
00:21:18,771 --> 00:21:20,737
可以成为我们的出路
And it could be our escape.

323
00:21:25,777 --> 00:21:28,345
我觉得我丈夫失去了理智
I think my husband is losing his mind.

324
00:21:28,347 --> 00:21:29,813
那就离开他
So leave him.

325
00:21:29,815 --> 00:21:31,315
来追随这新的信仰
Come and follow this new faith.

326
00:21:31,317 --> 00:21:33,917
来追随耶稣
Come and follow Jesus.

327
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,086
你要求太多
You ask a lot.

328
00:21:38,656 --> 00:21:39,956
我需要考虑一下
I need to think.

329
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:45,295
无论何时你需要我 我都在
I'm here, whenever you need.

330
00:22:01,012 --> 00:22:03,280
我以为他是真心实意的
I thought he was genuine.

331
00:22:03,282 --> 00:22:06,116
我真以为我们有机会结束这...
I really thought we had a chance to end the...

332
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:07,951
- 我们出城吧  - 好极了
- Let's get out of the city.  - Great.

333
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:10,620
- 去山上等待耶稣归来  - 没错
- Go to the hills and wait for Jesus to return.  - Exactly.

334
00:22:12,557 --> 00:22:14,591
没人动啊
No one's moving.

335
00:22:14,593 --> 00:22:16,960
如果这不是耶稣归来的时刻呢?
What if this isn't the moment that Jesus comes back?

336
00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:18,862
如果一切结束之后...
What if when it's all over,

337
00:22:18,864 --> 00:22:22,432
没有地震 没有饥荒...
there are no troubles, no famine...

338
00:22:22,434 --> 00:22:25,936
只有一座在它最需要我们的时候却被抛弃的神殿?
just a temple that we abandoned when it needed us most?

339
00:22:25,938 --> 00:22:27,704
大祭司会来追杀我们
The high priest would come after us.

340
00:22:27,706 --> 00:22:29,239
我们不能迫于害怕去做事
We can't act out of fear.

341
00:22:29,241 --> 00:22:31,475
是的 我们必须凭良心做事
No. We must follow our conscience.

342
00:22:31,477 --> 00:22:32,776
成千上万人会死去
Thousands will die.

343
00:22:32,778 --> 00:22:36,413
你希望我们也被杀吗?
Do you want us to get caught up in that?

344
00:22:36,415 --> 00:22:39,282
我们的任务是出去传教 不是打仗
Our job is to go out and preach, not fight.

345
00:22:40,752 --> 00:22:42,552
彼得?
Peter?

346
00:22:42,554 --> 00:22:45,355
彼得 那些罗马人...
Peter, the Romans...

347
00:22:45,357 --> 00:22:47,457
你了解他们的为人
You know what they're like.

348
00:22:47,459 --> 00:22:49,226
你清楚他们会干出什么事
You know what they'll do.

349
00:22:49,228 --> 00:22:52,863
多马是对的...
Thomas is right...

350
00:22:52,865 --> 00:22:56,433
这不是我们的战争
This is not our fight.

351
00:22:56,435 --> 00:22:59,302
但如果我们离开这里 抛弃耶稣称为
But if we walk away and abandon the building

352
00:22:59,304 --> 00:23:02,005
他父之家的神殿...
that Jesus called his father's house...

353
00:23:02,907 --> 00:23:09,112
如果不试着阻止千万人死去...
if we do not try to stop thousands from dying...

354
00:23:10,048 --> 00:23:11,748
如果我们袖手旁观
if we do nothing,

355
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:14,317
我们岂不是和耶稣说过的祭司们一样了吗...
are we not just like the priest that Jesus told us about...

356
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:17,888
和那些走在路的对面
The one that walked on the other side of the road

357
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:21,925
不见周围被强盗袭击的人一样?
and ignored the man who'd been attacked by robbers?

358
00:23:27,632 --> 00:23:29,366
我们必须有所行动
So we have to act.

359
00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:31,201
我们必须出力帮忙
We have to help.

360
00:23:31,203 --> 00:23:33,804
尽我们所能
In any way we can.

361
00:23:36,341 --> 00:23:38,675
那我们走吧
Then let's go.

362
00:23:43,748 --> 00:23:46,249
那些 给我看看
Those ones. Let me see.

363
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:58,862
我收到煞买和希列学派的消息
I've heard from the schools of Shammai and Hillel.

364
00:23:58,864 --> 00:24:01,531
他们都将与您统一战线
They will all stand with you.

365
00:24:01,533 --> 00:24:04,568
时候也差不多了
It's nearly time.

366
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:07,471
在您去之前 我...
Before you go, I...

367
00:24:07,473 --> 00:24:09,706
我想跟您谈谈您的妻子
I need to talk to you about your wife.

368
00:24:13,111 --> 00:24:14,444
准备好了吗?
Are you ready?

369
00:24:14,446 --> 00:24:16,580
是的 巡抚
Yes, Governor.

370
00:24:16,582 --> 00:24:18,949
你人手够吗? 他们都清楚自己的使命吗?
You have enough men? They understand their duties?

371
00:24:18,951 --> 00:24:19,950
是的
They do.

372
00:24:29,027 --> 00:24:32,996
这事我不放心交给其他人
I would not trust this to any other man.

373
00:24:37,235 --> 00:24:39,236
怎么了?
What's the matter?

374
00:24:41,305 --> 00:24:43,907
没什么
Nothing.

375
00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:45,242
他们都是好人
They're good men.

376
00:24:47,378 --> 00:24:50,414
这座城市...
This city...

377
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:52,749
今日得好好教训一场
must be taught a lesson today.

378
00:24:54,786 --> 00:25:00,793
如有人试图阻拦 格杀勿论
If the crowd tries to impede your progress, kill them all.

379
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:49,926
来了
It's coming.

380
00:26:00,171 --> 00:26:02,439
退后! 闪开! 退开!
Stand back! Move aside! Stand aside!

381
00:26:02,441 --> 00:26:04,808
快点退开! 闪开!
Stand aside! Move aside!

382
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,976
退开! 闹也没用!
Stand aside! You cannot win this!

383
00:26:06,978 --> 00:26:08,878
别来送死!
Do not be the first to die!

384
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,447
退后! 赶紧退后!
Back! Stand back!

385
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:16,052
退后! 闪开!
Stand back! Stand aside!

386
00:27:17,081 --> 00:27:19,683
准备! 拉!
Go! Pull!

387
00:27:23,154 --> 00:27:26,623
拉紧绳子! 拉紧绳子!
Hold your lines! Hold your line!

388
00:27:26,625 --> 00:27:28,658
拉紧!
Hold!

389
00:27:30,628 --> 00:27:33,430
使劲! 拉!
Come on! Pull it!

390
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:23,279
让开 大祭司
Stand aside, High Priest.

391
00:28:25,983 --> 00:28:28,551
我也是奉命行事
I have my orders.

392
00:28:28,553 --> 00:28:29,886
请您让开
Now please stand aside.

393
00:29:42,793 --> 00:29:46,963
那就来吧 百夫长
Do what you have to, centurion.

394
00:29:46,965 --> 00:29:49,933
你可以一拳将我打死
You can kill me with a single blow,

395
00:29:49,935 --> 00:29:52,135
但会不断有人接替我
but I will instantly be replaced,

396
00:29:52,137 --> 00:29:54,704
一个接着一个
and so will the next man, and the next.

397
00:29:54,706 --> 00:29:57,407
就算是你也没法杀掉耶路撒冷所有人
Even you cannot murder everyone in Jerusalem.

398
00:30:33,611 --> 00:30:35,879
快! 快! 快!
Now! Now! Now!

399
00:31:05,409 --> 00:31:09,379
我们在天上的父 愿人都尊你的名为圣
Our father in heaven, hallowed be your name.

400
00:31:09,381 --> 00:31:11,247
愿你的国降临 愿你的旨意...
Your kingdom come, your will be done...

401
00:31:11,249 --> 00:31:13,516
我的性命在狮子中间...
I dwell amongst lions...

402
00:31:13,518 --> 00:31:16,286
- 行在地上 如同行在天上...  - 我躺卧在性如烈火的世人当中...
- on earth as it is in heaven...  - Forced to live amidst ravenous beasts...

403
00:31:16,288 --> 00:31:18,455
我们日用的饮食 今日赐给我们 免我们的债...
Give us today our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses...

404
00:31:18,457 --> 00:31:20,557
他们的牙齿是枪 箭...
men whose teeth are Spears and arrows...

405
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,727
如同我们免了人的债...
as we forgive those who trespass against us...

406
00:31:23,729 --> 00:31:26,529
- 神啊 愿你崇高 过于诸天...  - 不叫我们遇见试探
- Be exalted, O Lord, above the heavens...  - And lead us not into temptation,

407
00:31:26,531 --> 00:31:29,366
- 救我们脱离凶恶  - 愿你的荣耀 高过全地
- but deliver us from evil.  - And may your glory descend...

408
00:31:29,368 --> 00:31:33,770
我们在天上的父 愿人都尊你的名为圣
Our father in heaven, hallowed be your name.

409
00:31:34,772 --> 00:31:37,207
愿你的国降临 愿你的旨意
Your kingdom come, your will be done,

410
00:31:37,209 --> 00:31:39,209
行在地上 如同行在天上
on earth as it is in heaven.

411
00:31:40,611 --> 00:31:45,782
我的性命在狮子中间 我躺卧在性如烈火的世人当中
I dwell amongst lions, forced to live amidst ravenous beasts,

412
00:31:45,784 --> 00:31:48,785
他们的牙齿是枪 箭...
men whose teeth are Spears and arrows...

413
00:31:48,787 --> 00:31:52,389
如同我们免了人的债
as we forgive those who trespass against us.

414
00:31:52,391 --> 00:31:54,951
不叫我们遇见试探 救我们脱离凶恶
And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.

415
00:31:54,952 --> 00:31:57,227
他们的牙齿是枪 箭...
Men whose teeth are Spears and arrows...

416
00:31:57,229 --> 00:32:00,594
我的性命在狮子中间 我躺卧在性如烈火的世人当中...
I dwell amongst lions, forced to live amidst ravenous beasts...

417
00:32:00,595 --> 00:32:02,999
不叫我们遇见试探 救我们脱离凶恶
And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.

418
00:32:04,468 --> 00:32:08,195
我们日用的饮食 今日赐给我们 免我们的债...
Give us today our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses...

419
00:32:08,196 --> 00:32:09,239
退后!
Stay back!

420
00:32:09,241 --> 00:32:12,642
如同我们免了人的债...
as we forgive those who trespass against us...

421
00:32:17,682 --> 00:32:20,150
不叫我们遇见试探
and lead us not into temptation,

422
00:32:20,152 --> 00:32:22,052
救我们脱离凶恶
but deliver us from evil.

423
00:32:36,064 --> 00:32:39,032
大人 现在该怎么办?
What now, sir?

424
00:32:39,034 --> 00:32:41,234
对不起
I'm sorry.

425
00:32:41,236 --> 00:32:43,269
突然人群暴动
There was a sudden rush.

426
00:32:43,271 --> 00:32:45,638
当然我们把他们都杀了 但是...
We killed them all, of course, but...

427
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,475
我们没保护好雕像
We couldn't save the statue.

428
00:32:48,477 --> 00:32:49,576
百夫长 我们尽力了
We did try, centurion.

429
00:32:49,578 --> 00:32:51,144
我知道
I'm sure.

430
00:32:51,146 --> 00:32:53,046
如果我们必须为此受死...
If we must fall on our swords for our failures...

431
00:32:53,048 --> 00:32:54,914
今天不能再有牺牲了
There will be no more death today.

432
00:32:54,916 --> 00:32:56,616
召集士兵将雕像运回大殿
Get the men and the statue back to the palace.

433
00:32:56,618 --> 00:32:57,851
是的 大人 马上去办
Yes, sir. Right away.

434
00:32:57,853 --> 00:32:59,586
您受伤了吗?
Are you hurt?

435
00:32:59,588 --> 00:33:01,387
我? 没有 怎么了?
Me? No. Why?

436
00:33:01,389 --> 00:33:04,324
我以为您被砍倒了
I thought I saw you fall.

437
00:33:10,164 --> 00:33:12,398
去做你的事
You have your orders.

438
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,733
大人
Sir.

439
00:33:16,137 --> 00:33:19,672
士兵集合!
Soldiers, regroup!

440
00:33:55,476 --> 00:33:57,377
走吧
Come.

441
00:35:07,948 --> 00:35:10,850
你是对的
You were right.

442
00:35:10,852 --> 00:35:13,720
预言在今日没有实现
The prophecy would not be fulfilled today.

443
00:35:13,722 --> 00:35:17,557
神殿也保住了
And the temple is saved.

444
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:20,460
但耶稣呢?
But what about Jesus?

445
00:35:20,462 --> 00:35:22,796
我以为就是今天
I thought this was it.

446
00:35:22,798 --> 00:35:24,998
我以为能再次见到他了...
I thought I would see him again...

447
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,101
就在今日 此刻
Today, now.

448
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:33,740
你们刚才看到百夫长了吗?
Did you see the centurion?

449
00:35:33,742 --> 00:35:36,409
他没有参与战斗
He didn't fight.

450
00:35:38,479 --> 00:35:41,414
难道你们都没看到?
Did none of you see him?

451
00:35:41,416 --> 00:35:44,617
他跪下了
He knelt.

452
00:35:44,619 --> 00:35:47,187
他跪在了你面前 彼得
He knelt before you, Peter.

453
00:35:47,189 --> 00:35:49,389
百夫长?
A centurion?

454
00:35:49,391 --> 00:35:50,623
他为什么要这么做?
Why would he do such a thing?

455
00:35:50,625 --> 00:35:52,158
因为我给他施洗了
Because I baptized him.

456
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,261
什么?
You did what?

457
00:35:55,263 --> 00:35:58,598
大帝会再送来雕像...
He'll send another...

458
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,767
一个不成再来一个
and then another.

459
00:36:00,769 --> 00:36:03,369
真没想到这么没完没了
I can't believe it's not over.

460
00:36:06,874 --> 00:36:08,541
你怎么想?
What do you think?

461
00:36:11,245 --> 00:36:12,812
你在乎吗?
What do you care?

462
00:36:17,084 --> 00:36:19,686
下次我会加派人手
I'll bring in more men next time.

463
00:36:20,754 --> 00:36:22,822
上午就钉死四十个女人
I'll crucify 40 women in the morning

464
00:36:22,824 --> 00:36:24,657
让他们乖乖待在家里...
to keep them in their houses...

465
00:36:24,659 --> 00:36:26,192
上街的就处死
Kill anyone who's seen on the streets.

466
00:36:26,194 --> 00:36:27,260
不信他们不听话
That'll do the trick.

467
00:36:30,231 --> 00:36:32,332
我要跟哥尼流谈一下

470
00:36:41,676 --> 00:36:43,309
你的计划真恶心

471
00:36:43,311 --> 00:36:45,278
身居此位就是如此
They come with the job.

472
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,747
你让我憎恶

我要召见大祭司和他妻子...

你去给他们安排点好吃好喝的

476
00:36:55,891 --> 00:36:58,324
粉饰下气氛 懂吗?

你没听见我说的吗?
Are you not listening?

478

00:37:14,976 --> 00:37:16,709
一个你永远找不到我的地方

你看过我是怎么对待敌人的

482
00:37:25,686 --> 00:37:29,956
你觉得我不会也如此为你奋力而战吗?
You don't think I would fight as hard for you?

483

这么残忍的事你说得可真浪漫

你清楚我的为人...
You know who I am...

那我就割断纽带
Then I cut our ties.

00:37:50,112 --> 00:37:52,145
一刀两断
I slash them apart.

489
00:37:53,948 --> 00:37:55,648

什么?
What?

495

巡抚他召见我
The Governor. He summoned me.

496
00:38:16,872 --> 00:38:19,606
我... 我想是吧
I... I suppose.

497
00:38:19,608 --> 00:38:21,174
不能让他一直等我
I shouldn't keep him waiting.

498
00:38:21,176 --> 00:38:22,475
你杀了多少人?
How many did you kill?

499
00:38:22,477 --> 00:38:25,779
一个都没杀
I killed no one.

500
00:38:25,781 --> 00:38:27,046
我弃岗了
I abandoned my post.

501
00:38:27,048 --> 00:38:28,314
我不知道自己是怎么活下来的
I don't know how I'm still alive.

502
00:38:28,316 --> 00:38:31,551
你没有参战? 有人看到吗?
You didn't fight? Did anyone see?

503
00:38:31,553 --> 00:38:32,852
可能有
Possibly.

504
00:38:34,522 --> 00:38:36,790
那么...
Then...

505
00:38:36,792 --> 00:38:38,658
要是我丈夫知道了...
If my husband learns the truth...

506
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,393
我会以叛国罪处死

我们逃走吧
We can run.

我有钱...
I have money...

509
00:38:46,701 --> 00:38:48,468
足够保我们平安

我们去哪儿?
Where would we go?

511
00:38:50,572 --> 00:38:52,772
去... 去天涯海角
To... to the ends of the earth.

512
00:38:55,242 --> 00:38:57,143
你真想让我离开他吗?

当然

我的妻儿都收拾好准备上路了

只要我们心中有他 在哪都无关紧要
It doesn't matter where we live once we have him in our hearts.

521
00:39:21,969 --> 00:39:24,404

任何人都不会被拒之门外
