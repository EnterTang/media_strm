当初同我来这的男人

是一个可靠而有志气的外交官
was a dependable, ambitious diplomat.

3
00:00:08,165 --> 00:00:09,752
你是怎么了?
What's happening to you?

4
00:00:10,396 --> 00:00:12,437
必须找人取代该亚法
Caiaphas who must be replaced.

5
00:00:12,476 --> 00:00:16,035
要是没手腕 就别搞政治游戏
Don't play politics unless you're good at it.

6
00:00:16,371 --> 00:00:22,479
即使面前是刀山火海 我们仍要无畏前行
We must push away our fear as we recognize the persecution we face.

7
00:00:22,838 --> 00:00:23,983
我是扫罗
I'm Saul.

8
00:00:24,017 --> 00:00:25,818
我来扫除这些渎神者
I have come to remove these blasphemers.

9
00:00:25,853 --> 00:00:28,454
用尽一切办法
Do whatever is necessary.

10
00:00:30,057 --> 00:00:31,257
尽量拿上行李!
Take what you can!

11
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:34,594
我才不会被这个男人和他的威胁所吓倒
I will not be cowed by this man and his threats.

12
00:00:34,628 --> 00:00:36,696
这是我的土地 我要留下来
This was my land. I'm staying.

13
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,764
- 还有我  - 我们耶路撒冷见
- And me.  - See you in Jerusalem.

14
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:40,533
那里! 抓住他!
There! Take him!

15
00:00:40,567 --> 00:00:41,734
不!
No!

16
00:00:41,768 --> 00:00:43,936
我要毁了你!
I will crush you!

17
00:00:43,971 --> 00:00:46,706
放马过来!

那个拿撒勒人的信众就躲在这片区域
The Nazarene followers are hiding in this area.

29
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:14,734
他们在哪?
Where are they?

30
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:20,540
耶稣告诉我们...
Jesus told us...

31
00:01:20,574 --> 00:01:22,441
这酒...
that this wine...

32
00:01:23,977 --> 00:01:25,745
是他的血...
was his blood...

33
00:01:32,486 --> 00:01:33,753
而这饼...
and this bread...

34
00:01:35,923 --> 00:01:38,291
是他的身体
his body.

35
00:01:44,765 --> 00:01:47,266
妈妈! 妈妈!
Mom! Mom!

36
00:01:47,301 --> 00:01:50,937
我们现今吃下喝下它们 好叫我们有力气
We eat and drink them now to give us the strength

37
00:01:50,971 --> 00:01:52,905
为他见证
to bear witness to him

38
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,309
与他同在
and to live in unity with him.

39
00:02:07,888 --> 00:02:11,924
圣灵叫我必须去撒玛利亚
The Holy Spirit tells me I must go to Samaria.

40
00:02:14,194 --> 00:02:16,529
要让他的道传遍各地
The word needs to be heard everywhere.

41
00:02:16,563 --> 00:02:19,132
我不觉得到撒玛利亚会有何益处 腓力
I don't think it'll be any better in Samaria, Philip.

42
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,801
要是他们发现你来自耶路撒冷...
If they discover you're from Jerusalem...

43
00:02:23,036 --> 00:02:24,637
他们会叫你粉身碎骨
they'll tear you apart.

44
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,609
肯定有善良的撒玛利亚人
I'm sure there are some good Samaritans.

45
00:02:29,643 --> 00:02:32,245
我会找到他们的
I'll find them.

46
00:02:36,116 --> 00:02:38,151
大家分散开
Break it down.

47
00:02:45,158 --> 00:02:47,393
彻底搜查
Search everywhere.

48
00:02:51,098 --> 00:02:52,598
保持安静 小心点
Keep quiet. Be careful.

49
00:03:10,284 --> 00:03:12,084
我们走吧
Let's go.

50
00:03:18,025 --> 00:03:22,228
你们忠于神和神殿
Your loyalty is to God and the temple,

51
00:03:22,262 --> 00:03:25,198
而非基督
not your Jesus.

52
00:03:25,232 --> 00:03:26,432
把他们带走
Take them away.

53
00:03:26,466 --> 00:03:28,334
快走!
Move!

54
00:03:40,581 --> 00:03:43,716
你与五个人讲道
For every five people you talk to,

55
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,751
他们又会分别再传与五个人
they'll talk to five more.

56
00:03:45,786 --> 00:03:49,422
要不了多久我们就会多如繁星
Soon we'll be as numerous as the stars.

57
00:03:57,931 --> 00:03:59,031
玛利亚
Mary.

58
00:04:00,734 --> 00:04:02,435
他们的父母被扫罗逮起来
Their parents were arrested by Saul.

59
00:04:02,469 --> 00:04:03,736
我们会保他们平安
We'll keep them safe.

60
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:06,038
扫罗封锁了街道
You should think about leaving, too,

61
00:04:06,073 --> 00:04:07,440
你也该考虑离开这
while Saul is off the streets.

62
00:04:07,474 --> 00:04:09,008
他找的是你
It's you he's after.

63
00:04:09,042 --> 00:04:11,911
民众一直投奔我们而来
People are coming to us all the time.

64
00:04:11,945 --> 00:04:14,447
要是我们不提供庇护 他们可怎么办?
What would they do if we weren't here to give shelter?

65
00:04:14,481 --> 00:04:17,316
我该走了
I should go while I can.

66
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:21,053
大家保重
Take care, all of you.

67
00:05:20,781 --> 00:05:23,116
大帝在来的路上
The Emperor is coming.

68
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,650
到耶路撒冷来?
To Jerusalem?

69
00:05:24,685 --> 00:05:26,005
也没人预先告诉我
I've had no warning, either.

70
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:28,020
他马上就要到了
His arrival is imminent.

71
00:05:28,055 --> 00:05:29,655
他为何而来?
Why is he coming?

72
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:30,990
我不知道
I don't know.

73
00:05:31,025 --> 00:05:33,926
但要是他在我们身上挑出错
But if he finds fault in either of us,

74
00:05:33,961 --> 00:05:35,495
肯定会施加惩罚
he will take action.

75
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:38,064
他可无权对神殿指手画脚
He has no power over the temple.

76
00:05:38,098 --> 00:05:40,767
该亚法 他是皇帝
Caiaphas, he's the Emperor.

77
00:05:40,801 --> 00:05:44,404
要是他打算剥掉我们俩的官服 他就能做到
If he decides to strip us both of our positions, he will.

78
00:05:44,438 --> 00:05:47,540
要是他决定把你关在神殿里 
If he decides to burn the temple to the ground

79
00:05:47,574 --> 00:05:49,675
烧成白地 他就能做到
with you inside it, he will.

80
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:53,379
我们是一荣俱荣 一损俱损
We stand or fall together on this.

81
00:05:58,018 --> 00:06:01,219
我期望得到你的全面支持
I expect your full support.

82
00:06:08,128 --> 00:06:10,630
街上的冲突必须要终止了
The violence on the streets has to cease.

83
00:06:10,664 --> 00:06:13,741
把拿撒勒人的信徒聚集起来是犹太人的事
Rounding up the followers of the Nazarene is a Jewish matter.

84
00:06:13,743 --> 00:06:15,810
亲爱的女士 在大帝造访期间
For the duration of the Emperor's visit, dear lady,

85
00:06:15,844 --> 00:06:17,077
则是罗马人的事
is very much a Roman one. 

86
00:06:17,112 --> 00:06:19,013
你还希望我们为他的来访提供资金援助?
You also expect us to help pay for his visit?

87
00:06:19,047 --> 00:06:20,047
没错
I do.

88
00:06:20,048 --> 00:06:21,215
只要不是为了神做事
I can't use temple funds

89
00:06:21,249 --> 00:06:23,050
我就不能使用神殿的资金
for anything other than God's work.

90
00:06:23,084 --> 00:06:24,919
你可是大祭司啊!
You're the high priest!

91
00:06:24,953 --> 00:06:26,520
我可以减少逮捕行动
The arrests I can curtail.

92
00:06:26,554 --> 00:06:30,057
至于这个资金问题 不能由神殿解决
As for these extra funds, they can't come from the temple.

93
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:37,531
不过倒是有私人可以提供援助
But they could come from a private source.

94
00:06:37,566 --> 00:06:40,134
我会派哥尼流去取钱
I'll send Cornelius to collect.

95
00:06:42,504 --> 00:06:44,738
我们居然要在提庇留身上慷慨解囊?
We're to lavish money on Tiberius,

96
00:06:44,773 --> 00:06:47,575
他可是一声令下就让成千上万
the man who expelled thousands of our people

97
00:06:47,609 --> 00:06:49,910
我们的人民流离失所的人
from their homes in Rome on a whim?

98
00:06:49,945 --> 00:06:53,447
为了取悦罗马人 你究竟要走到哪步田地?
How far will you go to keep Rome happy?

99
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:55,749
我们可没那些钱
We don't have the money.

100
00:06:57,152 --> 00:06:59,820
我们当然没有
We don't, no.

101
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,900
撒玛利亚

102
00:07:27,382 --> 00:07:28,849
我帮你
Let me help you.

103
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:04,932
我还以为你禁止我进入这座房子
As I understood it, you'd banned me from this house.

104
00:08:04,966 --> 00:08:06,033
没错
I had.

105
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:08,135
但和你女儿讨论之后
But in discussion with your daughter,

106
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:12,655
我只好与你和解
I felt compelled to offer the hand of reconciliation.

107
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:16,810
这对彼此都好
This is for the good of us all.

108
00:08:19,547 --> 00:08:22,749
我可以原谅你妄图取代我的愚蠢行径
Your clumsy attempt to unseat me can be forgiven.

109
00:08:24,085 --> 00:08:27,654
六万银币? 你疯了吗?
60,000 denarii? Are you insane?

110
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:29,957
我会破产的
I'll be bankrupt.

111
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:37,231
这钱是送给彼拉多 还是更糟 给提庇留?
Is this money bound for Pilate or, worse, Tiberius?

112
00:08:37,265 --> 00:08:40,133
我想送给谁就送给谁
It's bound for wherever I choose to send it.

113
00:08:40,168 --> 00:08:43,937
我明白你和罗马关系匪浅
I know you have a special relationship with Rome,

114
00:08:43,972 --> 00:08:47,975
但别以为每个人都感到高兴
but don't presume that everyone is happy about it.

115
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:51,044
高兴是有代价的 亚那
Happiness comes at a price, Annas.

116
00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:53,147
这就是你的代价
This is yours.

117
00:08:57,185 --> 00:08:58,345
大帝一来
With the Emperor coming,

118
00:08:58,353 --> 00:09:00,087
内务处就在招人了
households are taking on more staff.

119
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:02,890
你说我们留在耶路撒冷太危险了
You told me it was too dangerous for us to stay in Jerusalem,

120
00:09:02,924 --> 00:09:05,925
而你现在又想替罗马人工作?
and now you want to work for the Romans?

121
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,595
城里大部分食物都被拿去供给他们了
Most of the city's food's been taken in to feed them.

122
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,464
要是我进了内务处
If I'm part of a household,

123
00:09:10,498 --> 00:09:12,666
我就有机会去厨房
I'll have access to the kitchens.

124
00:09:14,469 --> 00:09:16,036
真高兴你是我们的人
I'm glad you're on our side.

125
00:09:17,806 --> 00:09:19,740
嗯?
Hmm?

126
00:09:23,077 --> 00:09:26,046
我能帮你什么 朋友?
Can I help you, friend?

127
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,682
终于有个仁慈的人了
A kind face at last.

128
00:09:44,699 --> 00:09:46,833
我叫伊扎克
My name is Yitzhak.

129
00:09:46,868 --> 00:09:48,402
腓力
Philip.

130
00:09:48,436 --> 00:09:51,004
你从哪来 腓力?
Where have you come from, Philip?

131
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,206
耶路撒冷
Jerusalem.

132
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,540
大多数耶路撒冷来的人
Most people who come from Jerusalem

133
00:09:53,575 --> 00:09:56,210
都避开撒玛利亚的城市... 太危险了
avoid Samaritan cities... too dangerous.

134
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,447
他们拿走了你的鞋
They took your shoes.

135
00:10:00,482 --> 00:10:01,682
还有个坠子
And a pendant.

136
00:10:03,384 --> 00:10:06,286
是我母亲的 对我意义重大
Belonged to my mother. Meant a lot to me.

137
00:10:09,824 --> 00:10:11,592
到市集去吧
Come to the marketplace.

138
00:10:11,626 --> 00:10:15,529
奇迹即将上演
Wonders are about to be performed.

139
00:10:50,732 --> 00:10:58,732
你们在此将目睹一个人的大能...
You're here to witness the great powers of one man...

140
00:10:59,207 --> 00:11:04,244
让人惊叹 治愈一切疾病的能力
The power to amaze, the power to cure all ills,

141
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:07,981
神的大能!
the power of God himself!

142
00:11:08,016 --> 00:11:11,118
西门...
Simon...

143
00:11:11,152 --> 00:11:13,487
魔法师!
the sorcerer!

144
00:11:51,793 --> 00:11:56,630
告诉我彼得在哪...
Tell me where Peter is...

145
00:11:56,664 --> 00:11:58,198
我们就停手
a nd we'll stop.

146
00:12:04,806 --> 00:12:06,740
再打
Again.

147
00:12:10,211 --> 00:12:12,246
有何贵干?
What do you want?

148
00:12:17,585 --> 00:12:19,586
那是什么?
What is that?

149
00:12:19,621 --> 00:12:22,623
彼拉多下令停止逮捕
Pilate demands that the arrests stop.

150
00:12:22,657 --> 00:12:24,591
该亚法同意了
Caiaphas agrees.

151
00:12:35,603 --> 00:12:37,771
但我是在做神的工
But I'm doing God's work.

152
00:12:37,806 --> 00:12:40,340
在耶路撒冷不行 不能做...
Not in Jerusalem, you're not...

153
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:43,377
至少大帝在此期间不行
At least not while the Emperor's here.

154
00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:58,725
有过侍候经验的 举手
Those with serving experience, raise your hands.

155
00:12:59,928 --> 00:13:02,029
你 过来
You. Here.

156
00:13:07,936 --> 00:13:09,169
这是什么意思?
What does this mean?

157
00:13:09,204 --> 00:13:11,772
你以后就在巡抚家当差了

158
00:13:11,806 --> 00:13:13,640
- 不行 我... 我不能  - 嗯?
- N...no. I... I can't.  - Hmm?

159
00:13:17,045 --> 00:13:19,179
让你在哪做你就得听话

160
00:13:19,214 --> 00:13:20,347
还有谁?
Who else?

腓利... 来自耶路撒冷

162
00:13:32,761 --> 00:13:34,761
腓利在这儿吗?
Is Philip here?

163
00:13:36,798 --> 00:13:39,366
你需要我的帮助
You're in need of my help.

164
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:42,236
我的天赋是为大家服务的 让他过来
Know my gift is for all. Let him pass.

165
00:13:53,181 --> 00:13:56,683
你身陷不幸
You have fallen into misfortune,

166
00:13:56,718 --> 00:14:01,889
并且你失去了某样有重大...
and you have lost something of great...

167
00:14:01,923 --> 00:14:05,926
个人意义的东西 对吗?

168
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,163
一件坠饰
A pendant,

169
00:14:09,197 --> 00:14:11,298
是已逝的母亲给我的
given to me by my late mother.

170
00:14:20,742 --> 00:14:22,643
我帮你找回来了
It's no longer lost.

171
00:14:38,126 --> 00:14:40,194
你花多少钱买来的?
How much did you pay for this?

172
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:45,566
还是根本就是你手下的强盗?
Or do the robbers work for you?

173
00:14:47,635 --> 00:14:48,802
看到了吗?
You see?

174
00:14:48,837 --> 00:14:52,806
不是所有人都对我的天赋心存感激
Not everyone is grateful for the gifts that I bring.

175
00:14:52,841 --> 00:14:54,642
你没有天赋
You have no gift,

176
00:14:54,676 --> 00:14:57,144
没有神的大能
no power from God,

177
00:14:57,178 --> 00:14:59,313
只不过是雕虫小技
just cheap trickery.

178
00:15:05,787 --> 00:15:08,322
滚回犹太吧!
Go home to Judea!

179
00:15:11,287 --> 00:15:14,272

收成好吗?
Good catch?

182
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:32,813
嘿! 你不能就这么走进来!
Hey! You can't just walk in here!

183
00:15:32,847 --> 00:15:34,681
这是我家!
This is my home!

184
00:15:44,325 --> 00:15:46,994
如果你在找我父亲 他不在家
If you're looking for my father, he's not here.

185
00:15:50,632 --> 00:15:52,065
你是谁?
Who are you?

186
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,034
能不能麻烦你给我点
I don't suppose I could trouble you

187
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:57,404
水喝... 拜托了
for some water... Please.

188
00:16:43,118 --> 00:16:48,355
如果彼得在耶路撒冷 我会找到他的

189
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:53,160
他留在那也好 回来也罢 都没有区别
If he stays there or comes here, doesn't make a difference.

190
00:16:53,194 --> 00:16:56,330
他知道我是谁

191
00:16:56,364 --> 00:16:59,366
他知道我的厉害

我的妻子克劳迪娅会照顾您

洗澡
A bath.

206
00:18:27,371 --> 00:18:30,941
我叔叔长途跋涉后就是这样
My uncle's always like this after a long journey.

207
00:18:30,975 --> 00:18:33,043
上次在坎帕尼亚 他一连三天没说话
In Campania, he didn't speak for three days.

208
00:18:33,077 --> 00:18:34,444
是不是 卡里古拉?
Isn't that right, Caligula?

209
00:18:34,479 --> 00:18:35,912
别这么叫我 阿格里帕
Don't call me that, Agrippa.

欢迎来到耶路撒冷

213
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:48,191
你要是知道我们为何来此
You may not be so keen to welcome us

214
00:18:48,226 --> 00:18:50,027
可能就不会这么热烈欢迎我们了
when you find out why we're here.

215
00:18:52,497 --> 00:18:54,197
扫罗说他会找到你的
Saul said he would find you.

216
00:18:54,232 --> 00:18:57,234
他伤害你了吗?
Did he hurt you?

没有

218
00:19:01,472 --> 00:19:03,473

非常抱歉

00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:15,619
你不该来的

223
00:19:15,653 --> 00:19:17,287
耶路撒冷太危险了

224
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,956
但我必须要警告你
But I had to warn you.

225
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,558
我们得采取行动
We have to do something.

226
00:19:21,592 --> 00:19:22,759
我知道
I know.

227
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:27,531
我知道
I know.

228
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:31,068
我们今晚安排了一场盛宴
We have arranged a banquet for tonight.

229
00:19:31,102 --> 00:19:32,469
不要宴请
No banquets.

230
00:19:32,503 --> 00:19:33,904
但您得吃东西啊
But you have to eat.

231
00:19:33,938 --> 00:19:36,640
不要宴请 不要公告
No banquets, no proclamations,

232
00:19:36,674 --> 00:19:39,076
没有演说 不收礼物
no addresses, and no gifts.

233
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,977
那就家常便饭吧
A simple meal, then.

234
00:19:41,012 --> 00:19:42,412
如果您想离席
And when you wish to leave,

235
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:44,147
我会带您回房去

236
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:46,149
我来送您回屋
I'll see the Emperor to his rooms.

237
00:19:46,184 --> 00:19:47,318
您在此期间
Is there anything in particular you wish to see

238
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:48,886
有什么特意想看的吗?
while you are here?

00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,054
只想见你和其他
Just you and anyone else

240
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:53,824
名义上管理此处的人
who claims to be running this province.

241
00:20:02,934 --> 00:20:05,335
如果大帝是来罢免你的
If the Emperor has come to remove you,

242
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,737
那我们得跟他的继位者
we must avoid dishonor

243
00:20:06,771 --> 00:20:10,674
搞好关系免遭羞辱
by cultivating goodwill with his successor.

244
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,809
你是指卡里古拉?
You mean Caligula?

245
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:14,512
还有他的朋友
And we must indulge his friend, too,

246
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:18,882
即便他是希罗底的兄弟 我们也得迁就下他
even if he is the brother of Herodias.

247
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:29,993
我有神的大能 我可以治愈你母亲
I have the power of God. I can cure your mother.

248
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:42,172
附着她的鬼很强大
Her demons are strong.

249
00:20:42,206 --> 00:20:44,942
把她关在我触不到的地方
They keep her far from my reach.

250
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:02,592
把她搬回我的帐篷里
Have her carried back to my tent.

251
00:21:08,366 --> 00:21:11,101
慢着!
Wait!

252
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:15,405
让我试试
Let me try.

253
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:24,581
不 不 不
No, no, no, no, no, no.

254
00:21:24,615 --> 00:21:26,750
让他过来
Let him pass.

255
00:21:28,653 --> 00:21:32,022
他觉得自己比我厉害
He thinks he can do what I can't.

256
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:44,968
如果你失败了
If you fail,

257
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:47,938
他们会杀了你
they'll kill you.

258
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:17,935
奉神的儿子
In the name of Jesus,

259
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:21,571
耶稣之名...
the son of God...

260
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:23,440
我将你从监牢中释放
I release you from your prison.

261
00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:46,963
这才是真正的奇迹!
It's a true miracle!

262
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:51,335
这才是真正的能力 耶稣的能力
There is the true power, the power of Jesus.

263
00:23:39,286 --> 00:23:40,586
哦! 哦!
Oh! Oh!

264
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,289
不如罗马婊子们结实...
Not as solid as the Roman whores...

265
00:23:43,323 --> 00:23:47,626
不过够嫩... 足够让未来的皇帝满足一下了
But still... enough flesh to satisfy a future Emperor.

266
00:24:01,241 --> 00:24:02,741
我 呃
I, um

267
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:06,812
我想你还满意你的房间吧
I take it you are happy with your rooms.

268
00:24:06,847 --> 00:24:09,415
还过得去
They're passable.

269
00:24:18,725 --> 00:24:21,060
我刚刚还在跟这些人说
I was just telling these pups

270
00:24:21,094 --> 00:24:24,830
上次那群犹太人在罗马冒犯你的事情
about the last time the Jews crossed you in Rome.

271
00:24:24,864 --> 00:24:27,700
那些没被我们驱逐或者杀死的人
Those we didn't expel or put to the sword,

272
00:24:27,734 --> 00:24:29,635
都被征用并流放
we conscripted and sent

273
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:32,838
到了帝国的边疆
to the furthest limits of the empire.

274
00:24:32,873 --> 00:24:35,241
你该这样和他们打交道...
That's how you deal with these people...

275
00:24:35,275 --> 00:24:36,342
用铁腕
with a firm hand.

276
00:24:36,376 --> 00:24:39,178
你有铁腕吗?
Do you have a firm hand?

277
00:24:39,212 --> 00:24:42,648
你还有野心吗 彼拉多?
Do you still harbor ambitions, Pilate?

278
00:24:42,682 --> 00:24:44,750
给我看个没有野心的罗马人
Show me an unambitious Roman,

279
00:24:44,784 --> 00:24:46,886
我就杀给你看看
and I'll show you a dead one.

280
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:51,657
但是你拼了命才能控制住犹太这样的小省
And yet you struggle to control a minor province like Judea.

281
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:56,128
这里有特殊情况 凯撒...
There are unique problems here, Caesar...

282
00:24:56,163 --> 00:24:59,398
要和犹太公会 神殿和祭司打交道...
Managing the Sanhedrin, the temple, the priests...

283
00:24:59,433 --> 00:25:00,766
祭司?
Priests?

284
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,170
在叙利亚 那里的巡抚还得对付
In Syria, the Governor has invading Parthians

285
00:25:04,204 --> 00:25:05,404
来犯的安息人
to contend with.

286
00:25:05,438 --> 00:25:09,275
无意冒犯 任何人都会用武力
With all due respect, anyone can wield a sword.

287
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:13,112
管理犹太需要外交手段和策略
Judea requires diplomacy and tact.

288
00:25:13,146 --> 00:25:18,384
我相信我的丈夫非常具备这些能力
These are qualities I believe my husband has in abundance,

289
00:25:18,418 --> 00:25:21,987
而这些能力让他受到尊重和敬重
qualities that have led to a respect and esteem

290
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:26,025
这倒是少有
seldom seen in these situations.

291
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:28,861
我奉圣父 圣子和圣灵的名
I baptize you in the name of the father

292
00:25:28,895 --> 00:25:32,131
为你施洗
and of the son and of the Holy Spirit.

293
00:25:44,945 --> 00:25:47,046
你是否悔改你的罪?
Do you repent your sins?

294
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:51,750
我悔改
I do.

295
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:56,622
我奉...
I baptize you...

296
00:25:58,225 --> 00:26:00,926
圣父 圣子耶稣和圣灵的名
in the name of the father and of the son, Jesus Christ,

297
00:26:00,961 --> 00:26:02,828
为你施洗
and of the Holy Spirit.

298
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:15,207
谢谢你
Thank you.

299
00:26:20,847 --> 00:26:22,748
这已经不是第一次
It's not the first time

300
00:26:22,782 --> 00:26:24,683
在耶路撒冷出现骚乱了
there's been unrest in Jerusalem.

301
00:26:24,718 --> 00:26:27,520
这地方到底怎么了?
What is it about this place?

302
00:26:28,889 --> 00:26:31,023
各地的人都被吸引到这里来...
People are drawn here from all over...

303
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:32,992
各有不同的信仰和信念
people of many faiths and beliefs.

304
00:26:33,026 --> 00:26:36,162
这就是你感受到的那股能量
That's the energy you feel.

305
00:26:36,196 --> 00:26:38,831
是让我好奇的能量
It's what made me curious.

306
00:26:38,865 --> 00:26:40,566
你喜欢这里吗?
You like it here?

307
00:26:42,536 --> 00:26:46,138
这城市最好的地方在于...
The best thing about this city...

308
00:26:46,173 --> 00:26:50,142
它离我们在海边的家只有一天的路程
is that it's one day's journey to our home on the coast.

309
00:26:54,915 --> 00:26:56,615
您在这里很安全
You are safe here.

310
00:26:58,819 --> 00:27:00,953
我是大帝
I'm the Emperor.

311
00:27:00,987 --> 00:27:02,855
我在哪里都不安全
I'm not safe anywhere.

312
00:27:26,446 --> 00:27:28,881
你也许能吓倒小孩子
You might stoop to scaring children,

313
00:27:28,915 --> 00:27:34,286
但是你的迫害只能让我们心中圣灵之火
but your persecution only makes the Holy Spirit

314
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:36,655
烧得更旺
burn stronger within us.

315
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:41,026
那就更该结束你的生命了
All the more reason to put an end to you.

316
00:27:41,061 --> 00:27:45,731
你终结不了我们的 扫罗
You can't put an end to me, Saul.

317
00:27:45,766 --> 00:27:48,100
我在这里是神的旨意
It's God's will I'm here,

318
00:27:48,135 --> 00:27:52,071
而我何时何地死也凭神的旨意
and it'll be God's will where and when I am to die.

319
00:27:52,105 --> 00:27:56,542
也许我在此也是神的旨意 对吧?
Perhaps it is God's will that I am here, too, yes?

320
00:27:56,576 --> 00:28:01,213
我们一定马上就能知道
I'm sure we'll find out

321
00:28:01,248 --> 00:28:04,350
我们之间
who is to live and who is to die

322
00:28:04,384 --> 00:28:06,485
谁死谁活!
soon enough!

323
00:28:11,124 --> 00:28:13,826
呵
Huh.

324
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,531
什么? 等等!
What? Wait!

325
00:28:18,565 --> 00:28:20,099
你就只和他动动嘴吗?
You're just going to talk to him?!

326
00:28:20,133 --> 00:28:21,200
彼得!
Peter!

327
00:28:21,234 --> 00:28:22,868
足够了
It's enough.

328
00:28:22,903 --> 00:28:24,103
不! 不!
No! No!

329
00:28:24,137 --> 00:28:26,338
我们不是暴力的人
We are not men of violence.

330
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:29,108
但是 彼得 我们终于抓到他了
But, Peter, we've finally got him.

331
00:28:29,142 --> 00:28:31,644
如果神真是在指引你们的话
You'd have thought that God

332
00:28:31,678 --> 00:28:33,646
你们本以为他
could have given you all a clearer vision

333
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:38,818
能让你们预见的更清晰吧
if, in fact, he was guiding you.

334
00:28:38,852 --> 00:28:43,234
很高兴知道你还在耶路撒冷 彼得
Good to know you're still in Jerusalem, Peter.

335
00:28:55,605 --> 00:28:57,073
你感觉到任何变化吗?
Do you feel any different?

336
00:29:01,011 --> 00:29:02,879
把你的刀给我
Give me your knife.

337
00:29:09,352 --> 00:29:10,453
没事的
It's all right.

338
00:29:10,487 --> 00:29:12,321
我已经受洗了 我已经受洗了
I've been baptized. I've been baptized.

339
00:29:12,355 --> 00:29:13,355
我可以治愈它的
I'll heal it.

340
00:29:21,531 --> 00:29:24,633
为什么? 为什么我没有得到腓利那样的能力 嗯?
Why? Why have I not been given the same power as Philip, eh?

341
00:29:25,902 --> 00:29:28,838
我可以给手绑上绷带了吗?
Can I bandage my hand now?

342
00:29:30,207 --> 00:29:34,643
我相信犯人的早饭一定很棒
I trust the condemned man ate a hearty breakfast.

343
00:29:34,678 --> 00:29:36,612
你们昨晚休息的好吗?
Did you rest well last night?

344
00:29:36,647 --> 00:29:38,280
很好
Oh, yes.

345
00:29:38,315 --> 00:29:39,815
我们休息得很好
We did.

346
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:43,686
希律·安提帕和希罗底
Herod Antipas and Herodias.

347
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,954
你们来干什么?
What are you doing here?

348
00:29:44,988 --> 00:29:46,389
大帝召见我
The Emperor summoned me.

349
00:29:46,423 --> 00:29:48,424
我们以为你去耶路撒冷的时候
We thought you would have paid us a visit

350
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:50,159
会顺路拜访一下我们 弟弟
on your way to jerusem, brother.

351
00:29:50,193 --> 00:29:54,864
他坚持要去 但是我强迫他跟着大部队走
He insisted, but I forced him to stay with the caravan.

352
00:29:58,969 --> 00:30:01,270
希律 欢迎来到犹太
Herod. Welcome to Judea.

353
00:30:28,965 --> 00:30:30,900
我就知道我认识你
I thought I recognized you.

354
00:30:36,873 --> 00:30:38,708
你是那个拿撒勒人的信徒
You're a follower of the Nazarene.

355
00:30:38,742 --> 00:30:40,242
你在这里干什么?
What are you doing here?

356
00:30:40,277 --> 00:30:43,946
呃... 我需要工作
Uh... I needed a job.

357
00:30:43,981 --> 00:30:46,248
好帮你的朋友?
To help your friends?

358
00:30:46,283 --> 00:30:47,717
他们也在这里吗?
Are they here, too?

359
00:30:49,219 --> 00:30:52,021
所有人都走了
Everyone's gone.

360
00:30:52,055 --> 00:30:53,222
我自己一个人
I'm on my own.

361
00:30:53,256 --> 00:30:54,857
告诉我有什么理由不此时此刻
You tell me why I shouldn't have you arrested

362
00:30:54,891 --> 00:30:56,158
就把你逮捕了
right here, right now.

363
00:30:57,728 --> 00:30:59,295
悉听尊便
Do what you have to do.

364
00:30:59,329 --> 00:31:00,463
你不害怕吗?
You're not scared?

365
00:31:00,497 --> 00:31:02,632
有人教导我要爱我的敌人
I've been taught to love my enemies,

366
00:31:02,666 --> 00:31:05,735
祝福那些诅咒我的人
to bless those who curse me.

367
00:31:12,509 --> 00:31:16,245
不要再让我看到你靠近巡抚
Don't let me see you near the Governor again.

368
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:17,713
懂了吗?
Understood?

369
00:31:30,761 --> 00:31:36,599
我相信眼下的情况没人能比我
I believe I have handled the situation here

370
00:31:36,633 --> 00:31:38,401
处理得更好了
as well as anyone could.

371
00:31:38,435 --> 00:31:41,137
这场暴动中有多少罗马人被杀了?
How many romans have been killed in this insurrection?

372
00:31:41,171 --> 00:31:42,972
只有一个
Just one.

373
00:31:43,006 --> 00:31:46,642
凶手已经被抓到并处决了
And his killer has been caught and executed.

374
00:31:46,676 --> 00:31:48,944
有多少狂热分子被清除了呢? 很多
How many zealots have been eliminated? Many.

375
00:31:48,979 --> 00:31:52,748
倒不如说是到处乱抓人
Some might say people were rounded up indiscriminately.

376
00:31:52,783 --> 00:31:55,184
安提帕 我以为你把耶稣这事的责任
I thought you'd have been happy, Antipas,

377
00:31:55,218 --> 00:31:58,654
推到我头上会很开心
having given over responsibility for Jesus to me.

378
00:32:00,324 --> 00:32:03,492
那个叛乱者耶稣  大祭司宣称他
Jesus, the rebel, whom the high priest claimed

379
00:32:03,527 --> 00:32:08,831
给神殿带来了很大的麻烦 他已经被钉死了...
was stirring up trouble for the temple has been crucified...

380
00:32:08,865 --> 00:32:10,499
他的追随者们都逃散了
And his followers scattered.

381
00:32:10,534 --> 00:32:11,667
一个很小的狂热教派
A small fanatic faction.

382
00:32:11,702 --> 00:32:15,538
多亏了我 已经不复存在了
A faction no longer, thanks to me.

383
00:32:15,572 --> 00:32:19,342
如果你统治这里你会怎么做?
What would you have done had you been ruling?

384
00:32:19,376 --> 00:32:21,077
哦 我会早下决定的
Oh, I'd have been more decisive sooner.

385
00:32:21,111 --> 00:32:22,378
我对巡抚无意冒犯
No offense to the Governor,

386
00:32:22,412 --> 00:32:25,281
但是我会把这场骚乱扼杀在摇篮里
but I would have killed this movement at its birth

387
00:32:25,315 --> 00:32:26,749
并用罗马的强大军力
and used the military might of Rome

388
00:32:26,783 --> 00:32:28,317
歼灭任何叛乱之象
to annihilate any signs of rebellion.

389
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:33,456
将逆贼粉身碎骨
Smashed their bones and crushed their skulls.

390
00:32:38,061 --> 00:32:40,162
我能传唤一个人吗?
Can I call someone to speak?

391
00:32:40,197 --> 00:32:41,297
叫吧
Go ahead.

392
00:33:01,618 --> 00:33:03,185
提庇留大帝
Emperor Tiberius.

393
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:06,822
你传犹太人为你辩护?
You call a Jew to plead for you?

394
00:33:06,857 --> 00:33:11,060
虽然我看似来为巡抚辩护
It may appear as if I'm here to plead for the Governor,

395
00:33:11,094 --> 00:33:14,063
实则我们共同保卫人民
but we united to protect the people

396
00:33:14,097 --> 00:33:16,265
和这座城市不受邪念侵染
and the city from a contagion.

397
00:33:16,299 --> 00:33:18,434
历年来 我相信彼拉多和我
Over the years, I believe Pilate and I

398
00:33:18,468 --> 00:33:20,202
逐渐达成共识
have come to an understanding

399
00:33:20,237 --> 00:33:22,471
明确了治理现状的最佳方式
on how best to deal with these situations.

400
00:33:22,506 --> 00:33:25,141
你是指 在乱贼对你的地位构成威胁时
You mean he executes rebels for you

401
00:33:25,175 --> 00:33:27,944
他替你将他们铲除干净?
when they're a threat to your status?

402
00:33:27,978 --> 00:33:30,179
耶稣是众人的公害
Jesus was a danger to us all.

403
00:33:30,214 --> 00:33:33,149
他用妄语和亵渎之言煽动群众
He stirred the people with lies and blasphemy.

404
00:33:33,183 --> 00:33:35,785
他想破除包括你在内的
He wanted to tear down all institutions,

405
00:33:35,819 --> 00:33:37,687
一切制度 一切权威
all authority, including yours.

406
00:33:37,721 --> 00:33:39,689
必须有人制止他 他也确实被制止了
He had to be stopped, and was.

407
00:33:39,723 --> 00:33:43,325
而你也一心想保护你的至圣所
You also had to preserve your holy of holies.

408
00:33:39,723 --> 00:33:43,325
{\an8}至圣所: 犹太圣殿最内层的位置 被认为是耶和华的住所

409
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,027
不是吗?
Am I right?

410
00:33:45,062 --> 00:33:48,564
伟大的将领庞贝不是去过那内殿
Didn't the great General Pompey find his way

411
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:51,267
然后说里面空空如也吗?
into that chamber and say there was nothing there?

412
00:33:51,301 --> 00:33:54,537
我们无需雕像或画像来证明其存在 因为他必在那里
We need no idols or images because we know he's there.

413
00:33:54,571 --> 00:33:55,571
谁?
Who?

414
00:33:55,606 --> 00:33:56,939
神
God.

415
00:34:01,078 --> 00:34:03,379
我还从没见过犹太人的神
I've never met a Jewish God.

416
00:34:03,413 --> 00:34:05,881
或许改天我去拜访下他
Maybe I could pay him a visit.

417
00:34:05,916 --> 00:34:07,750
憋着你的蠢话
Keep your idiotic thoughts to yourself.

418
00:34:07,784 --> 00:34:11,954
凯撒 任何新上任的官员都要花数年时间
It would take years, Caesar, for any new administration

419
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:14,056
才能有我和大祭司
to reach the level of understanding

420
00:34:14,091 --> 00:34:15,591
对此事的认知
the high priest and I have.

421
00:34:21,264 --> 00:34:22,398
如果你需要...
If you need more...

422
00:34:22,432 --> 00:34:24,100
可以退下了
You may leave.

423
00:34:24,134 --> 00:34:29,005
凯撒 如果能透露一下您的意向
Caesar, it would be helpful to know

424
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:33,509
那便再好不过了
in which direction you intend to turn next.

425
00:34:33,544 --> 00:34:34,977
我会告知你的
You'll be told.

426
00:34:35,012 --> 00:34:36,812
凯撒
Caesar.

427
00:35:00,127 --> 00:35:01,861
停手吧!
Stop!

428
00:35:11,508 --> 00:35:13,208
他不是彼得!
It's not Peter!

429
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,417
你在提庇留面前
You stood in front of Tiberius

430
00:35:22,452 --> 00:35:24,720
为彼拉多求情?!
and pleaded Pilate's cause?!

431
00:35:24,754 --> 00:35:26,054
我必须这么做
I had to.

432
00:35:26,089 --> 00:35:27,523
那万一功亏一篑
And what if, despite everything,

433
00:35:27,557 --> 00:35:29,858
大帝执意要将彼拉多撤职呢?
the Emperor decides to replace Pilate?

434
00:35:29,893 --> 00:35:32,261
- 到时我们会落得什么下场?!  - 我不知道
- Where will that leave us?!  - I don't know.

435
00:35:32,295 --> 00:35:35,564
我和家人撕破脸 可不是为了一句
I haven't risked my relationship with my family

436
00:35:35,598 --> 00:35:37,900
"我不知道"
for "I don't know."

437
00:35:37,934 --> 00:35:41,170
你必须要确保事情如我们所愿!
You need to be certain this will fall our way!

438
00:35:41,204 --> 00:35:43,639
我们很快就能知道了 不是吗?
Well, we'll soon find out, won't we?

439
00:35:44,974 --> 00:35:46,341
何事?
What?

440
00:35:46,376 --> 00:35:48,510
遇上麻烦了
We have a problem.

441
00:35:48,545 --> 00:35:49,711
解决掉
Solve it.

442
00:35:49,746 --> 00:35:50,879
解决掉!
Solve it!

443
00:35:50,914 --> 00:35:52,514
是扫罗
It's Saul.

444
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:56,417
他又开始逮捕民众了
He's back arresting people.

445
00:35:59,756 --> 00:36:02,057
带他们去牢房 亚设
Take them to the cell, Asher.

446
00:36:06,529 --> 00:36:09,031
哇哦! 哇哦
Whoa! Whoa.

447
00:36:09,065 --> 00:36:11,366
停下
Stop.

448
00:36:11,401 --> 00:36:13,302
这是怎么回事?
What's going on here?

449
00:36:13,336 --> 00:36:15,471
我们在逮捕异教徒
We're arresting heretics.

450
00:36:15,505 --> 00:36:17,272
耶稣的信徒
Followers of Jesus.

451
00:36:20,677 --> 00:36:21,677
带去牢房!
To prison!

452
00:36:21,678 --> 00:36:23,111
去牢房!
To prison!

453
00:36:28,084 --> 00:36:29,852
你干嘛?
What are you doing?

454
00:36:38,828 --> 00:36:42,831
我是罗马人 你胆敢碰我?
I am a Roman. You dare to touch me?

455
00:37:10,794 --> 00:37:13,729
你对这地方的评价很对
You're right about this place.

456
00:37:13,763 --> 00:37:16,665
这里的确蕴藏一股能量
It does have a kind of energy.

457
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:20,703
还有一种精神
and a spirit, too.

458
00:37:20,737 --> 00:37:24,407
能潜入你心底 在某方面改变你
It gets inside, changes you in some way.

459
00:37:28,211 --> 00:37:32,748
在海滨路上...
I saw four vultures...

460
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:35,684
我看见四只秃鹰
on the Coast Road,

461
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:38,254
翱翔于空中
riding the air.

462
00:37:38,288 --> 00:37:41,824
我的占卜师告诉我无需担心
My augur tells me not to worry.

463
00:37:44,294 --> 00:37:46,861
秃鹰也可能是吉兆
Vultures can be good omens.

464
00:37:46,896 --> 00:37:51,033
然而来这途中
And yet on the journey here,

465
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:54,870
我梦见有人出殡
I dreamt of a funeral procession.

466
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:58,874
这地方让你见到幻象
This place gives you visions.

467
00:38:00,877 --> 00:38:04,213
我有些梦已然成真...
Some of my dreams have come true...

468
00:38:06,383 --> 00:38:10,186
包括梦见拿撒勒人耶稣的事
including one about the Nazarene, Jesus.

469
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:13,889
但我没梦到会有人在今晚丧命
But I haven't dreamt about anyone dying tonight.

470
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:23,733
晚安 大帝
Good night, Emperor.

471
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:31,707
最后的机会了... 趁现在没动静
Last chance... come with us

472
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:32,875
跟我们走吧
while it's quiet.

473
00:38:32,909 --> 00:38:34,110
你知道我们不能走
You know we can't.

474
00:38:34,144 --> 00:38:35,578
但我们可以重获自由...
But we would be free...

475
00:38:35,612 --> 00:38:37,713
自由布道 洗礼
free to preach and baptize again.

476
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:40,950
我若跟你们走 扫罗又会追去
If I go with you, I'll just drag Saul after you.

477
00:38:40,984 --> 00:38:43,252
再说了 这里还有很多事未办完
And, anyway, there's much to do here.

478
00:38:43,286 --> 00:38:46,255
我们必须有人留在耶路撒冷
Some of us have to stay in Jerusalem.

479
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,523
照顾这位
Look after this one.

480
00:38:47,557 --> 00:38:49,291
我觉得应该是她照顾我
I think she'll be the one looking after me.

481
00:38:49,326 --> 00:38:51,794
再见 兄弟 多多保重
Goodbye, brother. Take care.

482
00:38:51,828 --> 00:38:53,930
你也是 神与你同在
You, too. God be with you.

483
00:39:17,354 --> 00:39:20,222
但万一提庇留觉得没了大祭司的协助
But what if it seems to Tiberius that I'm incapable of ruling

484
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:22,124
我无法管好这地方呢?
without the help of my high priest?

485
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:24,960
更何况有安提帕在伺机觊利...
And with Antipas waiting to take advantage...

486
00:39:24,994 --> 00:39:27,830
安提帕是个自私的阴险小人
Antipas is a self-serving viper.

487
00:39:27,864 --> 00:39:30,733
但还需要他来维持秩序
But he is necessary for maintaining order.

488
00:39:30,767 --> 00:39:33,069
他没有意识到的是
What he fails to realize

489
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:35,939
若我们其中一人倒下...
is that if one of us falters...

490
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:38,475
提庇留可能会让我们全部分崩离析
Tiberius could tear us all down.

491
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:40,543
他不过是个年迈的老人
He's a tired old man

492
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:43,680
开始觉得自己命不久矣
who's starting to feel the shadows closing in.

493
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:47,050
但他还是有权将我逐出犹太
But he is still capable of expelling me from Judea.

494
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:52,188
然后会怎么样呢?
And what happens then?

495
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,591
我们回不了罗马 会被众人耻笑
We can't go back to Rome. We'll be a laughingstock.

496
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:56,693
你在这可是政绩斐然
Your record here is exemplary.

497
00:39:56,727 --> 00:40:00,230
我觉得提庇留已经意识到了
I think Tiberius is starting to see for himself

498
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:04,334
耶路撒冷的问题很特殊
the unique problems that Jerusalem presents.

499
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:06,870
我们只需保持冷静
We just have to hold our nerve.

500
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,922
扫罗
Saul.

501
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:28,258
你跟我来
I need you to follow me.

502
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:30,727
有件事你最好知道
There's something you should hear.

503
00:40:42,073 --> 00:40:45,108
告诉这些人你刚说的拿撒勒人彼得的消息
Tell these men what you told us about the Nazarene, Peter.

504
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:51,948
你这个家伙 说话 否则我再打烂你的皮
Speak up, man, or I'll flay you again.

505
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:53,583
彼得离开了
Peter's gone.

506
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,618
去那里?
Where?

507
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:00,090
他... 他往北去了
H... he headed north.

508
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:02,325
那里?
Where?

509
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,127
大马士革 大马士革
Damascus, Damascus.

510
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:13,169
放他下来
Get him down.

511
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,807
这是奖励你的
You've earned that.

512
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:21,845
他上当了
He took the bait.

513
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:25,181
告诉一个人他最渴望听到的话 不上当才怪
Tell a man what he's dying to hear, and they always will.

514
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:29,481
你越来越像个政治家了
You're becoming quite the politician.

515
00:41:33,951 --> 00:41:35,881
信仰最大的敌人是否...
Will the biggest enemy of the faith...

516
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,381
- 你是谁?  - 我是耶稣
- Who are you?  - I am Jesus.

517
00:41:37,391 --> 00:41:39,281
会面临审判之日?
Face judgement day?
