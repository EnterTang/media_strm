1
00:00:02,672 --> 00:00:05,787
那个杀手是冲我来的
The assassin came for me.

2
00:00:07,513 --> 00:00:10,515
每天钉死十个犹太人
10 Jews will be crucified

3
00:00:10,517 --> 00:00:13,384
直到我抓到
every day until I have

4
00:00:13,386 --> 00:00:16,354
那个想杀我的人为止
the man who tried to kill me.

5
00:00:16,356 --> 00:00:17,622
爸爸
Papa.

6
00:00:17,624 --> 00:00:19,423
他的名字 还有他的藏身地点
His name and where to find him.

7
00:00:20,659 --> 00:00:23,127
要是我能找得到你 他们也会的
If I've found you, they will find you.

8
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:25,062
他的名字叫波阿斯
His name is Boaz.

9
00:00:26,098 --> 00:00:28,466
- 哪都不安全  - 有个地方
- Nowhere is safe.  - There is somewhere.

10
00:00:28,468 --> 00:00:30,401
那里的人能宽恕我的罪过
There are people who can forgive my sins.

11
00:00:30,403 --> 00:00:31,435
我叫司提反
I'm Stephen.

12
00:00:31,437 --> 00:00:32,570
- 闪开 孩子  - 不
- Move aside, boy.  - No.

13
00:00:33,605 --> 00:00:35,373
亚拿尼亚 你的心里有什么
What's in your heart, Ananias,

14
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:36,974
叫你欺哄圣灵?
to make you lie to the Holy Spirit?

15
00:00:36,976 --> 00:00:39,143
你和你的丈夫把房子卖掉的时候
When you and your husband sold your house,

16
00:00:39,145 --> 00:00:41,078
有没有给自己私自留下一些?
did you keep anything back for yourselves?

17
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,247
可能是留了一点 那又有什么关系?
There might have been something, but what does that matter?

18
00:00:44,584 --> 00:00:45,650
你欺哄人 不光是欺哄我们 
You've lied, not just to us,

19
00:00:45,652 --> 00:00:47,285
是欺哄神了
but to God.

快跑!
Run!

29
00:01:25,624 --> 00:01:27,458
他们害怕我
They're afraid of me.

30
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:31,662
发生在亚拿尼亚和撒非喇身上的事故与你无关
What happened to Ananias and Sapphira was not your doing.

31
00:01:31,664 --> 00:01:34,198
那是神的意愿
It was the will of God.

32
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,200
那为何神要让营地上的人
Then why does God want the people of this camp

33
00:01:36,202 --> 00:01:39,170
带着惧怕的目光看我呢?
to look on me with fear in their eyes?

34
00:01:39,172 --> 00:01:41,038
那你见我的眼中有恐惧吗?
Do you see fear in mine?

35
00:01:42,274 --> 00:01:44,175
他们心存信念
They have faith.

36
00:01:44,177 --> 00:01:46,444
假以时日 他们会明白的
In time, they will understand.

37
00:01:46,446 --> 00:01:51,249
这里本该是一片乐土
This is supposed to be a place of happiness.

38
00:01:51,251 --> 00:01:53,584
如果每天在耶路撒冷都有同胞被钉死在十字架上
How can it be a joyful place when, every day,

39
00:01:53,586 --> 00:01:56,721
这里又如何称得上是乐土呢?
more of our people are being crucified in Jerusalem?

40
00:01:56,723 --> 00:02:02,226
人间苦难深重
There's so much pain and despair.

41
00:02:02,228 --> 00:02:05,163
所以我儿子降临在这世界上
That's why my son came.

42
00:02:07,065 --> 00:02:08,966
救大众于水火之中
to free us from it.

43
00:02:18,944 --> 00:02:22,380
有波阿斯的消息了吗?
Any news of Boaz?

44
00:02:22,382 --> 00:02:23,748
还没有 巡抚
Nothing, Governor.

45
00:02:26,652 --> 00:02:29,854
今天在西区有个婚礼
There is a wedding today in the western quarter.

46
00:02:29,856 --> 00:02:31,155
我敢肯定在这两家人中
I'm sure that between both families,

47
00:02:31,157 --> 00:02:34,258
你能找到匡扶正义所需要牺牲的人
you will find the people justice demands.

48
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,930
抓10个女人...
Take 10 women...

49
00:02:38,932 --> 00:02:41,566
送上十字架
and crucify them.

50
00:02:43,802 --> 00:02:46,037
遵命 巡抚
Yes, Governor.

51
00:02:49,441 --> 00:02:51,809
你有什么话要讲吗?
You have something to say?

52
00:02:54,213 --> 00:02:55,980
你毫无怜悯之心吗?
Have you no mind for compassion?

53
00:02:55,982 --> 00:02:57,114
丝毫没有
I have not.

54
00:02:57,116 --> 00:03:01,485
对违抗命令的士兵 我的惩罚也不过如此
I do no more than I would to insubordinate soldiers.

55
00:03:12,297 --> 00:03:15,666
是神惩罚了亚拿尼亚和撒非喇
Ananias and Sapphira were punished by God

56
00:03:15,668 --> 00:03:17,668
因为他们欺哄了圣灵
for lying to t he Holy Spirit.

57
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,904
这件事引起了营地居民的极大关注
And this camp is focusing on that.

58
00:03:19,906 --> 00:03:25,009
而这种... 恐惧击倒了我们所有人
And this... fear is paralyzing all of us.

59
00:03:25,011 --> 00:03:29,647
然而我们要传递的应该 是爱与希望
But our message is one of love and hope.

60
00:03:29,649 --> 00:03:31,816
那我们该怎么做?
So, what are we to do?

61
00:03:31,818 --> 00:03:34,819
耶路撒冷里的人在受苦
There are people suffering in Jerusalem,

62
00:03:34,821 --> 00:03:37,455
我们可以给他们提供容身之所
and we can offer them safety here.

63
00:03:37,457 --> 00:03:38,956
与他们分享所有
Share what we have.

64
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:42,293
若非如此 我们和被神惩罚的那些人也没什么不同
If not, we're no different to those God has punished.

65
00:03:46,064 --> 00:03:51,369
那我们就必须去耶路撒冷 不管有多危险
Then we must go to Jerusalem, no matter how dangerous it is.

66
00:03:58,644 --> 00:04:00,678
都闪开!
Out of the way!

67
00:04:17,095 --> 00:04:22,700
玛雅 这是他玛
Maya. This is Tamar.

68
00:04:24,136 --> 00:04:27,238
她失去了所有亲人
She's lost everyone.

69
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,608
急需一个朋友
She really needs a friend.

70
00:04:41,387 --> 00:04:43,954
咱们去找个地方让你住下吧?
Shall we go find a place for you to stay?

71
00:04:53,031 --> 00:04:55,733
还有希望
There's hope.

72
00:04:57,035 --> 00:05:00,238
他们给了我们一个名字... 波阿斯
They've given us a name... Boaz.

73
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,740
就快抓到了
They're closing in.

74
00:05:02,742 --> 00:05:04,709
他们已经找到了他的未婚妻
They've already found his fiancee.

75
00:05:04,711 --> 00:05:07,411
顺着她就能找到他
She could lead us right to him.

76
00:05:16,121 --> 00:05:19,190
伊娃
Eva.

77
00:05:24,596 --> 00:05:27,899
我们已经知道了 是波阿斯杀了罗马士兵
We know it was Boaz who murdered the Roman soldier.

78
00:05:27,901 --> 00:05:29,567
你也知情
And so do you.

79
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:30,835
我帮不了你
I can't help you.

80
00:05:30,837 --> 00:05:32,670
是帮整个耶路撒冷
It's Jerusalem that's asking for help

81
00:05:32,672 --> 00:05:34,772
因为每天都有耶路撒冷人因他而死
because every day its people are being put to death

82
00:05:34,774 --> 00:05:36,674
替他受过
in his absence.

83
00:05:36,676 --> 00:05:39,143
如果他真的爱他的人民
If he truly loves his people,

84
00:05:39,145 --> 00:05:41,312
那他就该准备好杀身成仁
then he will be ready to give up his life for theirs.

85
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:47,785
你是在浪费你的时间
You're wasting your time.

86
00:05:47,787 --> 00:05:51,422
我求你了 伊娃
Then I beg you, Eva.

87
00:05:51,424 --> 00:05:54,559
如果你知道点什么... 名字也好 地方也好 什么都行...
If you know something... a name or a place, anything...

88
00:05:54,561 --> 00:05:55,960
你必须要告诉我
You must tell me.

89
00:05:57,963 --> 00:06:00,731
抱歉 什么都没有
I'm sorry, there's nothing.

90
00:06:02,134 --> 00:06:04,402
如果能救数百无辜犹太人的性命
It isn't a betrayal to save the lives

91
00:06:04,404 --> 00:06:07,538
那就算不上是背叛
of hundreds of innocent Jews.

92
00:06:25,424 --> 00:06:32,130
原谅我们擅自进来 但这些人都绝望了
Forgive our intrusion, but these people are desperate.

93
00:06:32,132 --> 00:06:33,631
你能帮帮他们吗?
Can you help them?

94
00:06:33,633 --> 00:06:36,601
即使有些人信仰不同?
Even those who do not share the belief?

95
00:06:36,603 --> 00:06:37,835
你叫什么名字?
What is your name?

96
00:06:37,837 --> 00:06:39,537
腓利
Philip.

97
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:40,905
他们怎么知道如何来这的?
How did they know to come here?

98
00:06:40,907 --> 00:06:41,706
我带他们来的
I brought them.

99
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:44,375
我听了你讲的道
I heard you speak.

100
00:06:44,377 --> 00:06:48,045
雅各给我施洗
And I was baptized by James.

101
00:06:48,047 --> 00:06:52,917
而且不知怎的 我知道你会来
And somehow, I knew you'd come.

102
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:55,520
我们得把这些人弄出城
We need to get these people out of the city

103
00:06:55,522 --> 00:06:56,954
越快越好
as quickly as possible.

104
00:06:56,956 --> 00:06:58,489
怎么弄?
How?

105
00:06:58,491 --> 00:07:00,491
罗马人就在街上随便抓人上十字架
Romans are out there looking for people to crucify.

106
00:07:00,493 --> 00:07:03,628
带他们去营地 分散去
Take them to the camp. Go in small groups.

107
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,329
走不同的路线
Use different routes.

108
00:07:07,032 --> 00:07:08,766
- 那里  - 是 长官
- There.  - Yes, sir.

109
00:07:11,036 --> 00:07:12,904
腓利
Philip.

110
00:07:12,906 --> 00:07:16,808
我能指望你把这些人组织好吗?
Can I trust you to organize these people?

111
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,209
没问题
You can.

112
00:07:18,211 --> 00:07:19,211
现在!
Now!

113
00:07:33,892 --> 00:07:37,061
是你干的 对吧?
It was you, wasn't it?

114
00:07:37,063 --> 00:07:39,130
那个犹太婚礼... 你给他们通风报信了
The Jewish wedding... You tipped them off.

115
00:07:39,132 --> 00:07:41,466
和巡抚夫人说话的时候注意点
Be careful how you speak to your governor's wife.

116
00:07:41,468 --> 00:07:43,835
我倒想知道 要是自己的夫人试图阻挠他的命令
I wonder how he'd react if he knew she'd attempted

117
00:07:43,837 --> 00:07:45,203
他会有什么反应
to sabotage his order.

118
00:07:45,205 --> 00:07:46,971
只有我们两个人听到了这件事
You and I were the only ones who heard it.

119
00:07:46,973 --> 00:07:49,540
我看得出你也讨厌那个命令
I saw your distaste for it.

120
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:54,612
不 我是一个士兵 我没有自己的看法
No, I'm a soldier. I don't have opinions.

121
00:07:54,614 --> 00:07:57,115
正是因为有我这样的人在遵守命令 罗马才会繁荣昌盛
And Rome only thrives because men like me obey orders.

122
00:07:57,117 --> 00:07:59,417
是啊 当然
Yes, of course.

123
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:02,487
抱着这种态度 你就能轻松
And how convenient that such an attitude absolves you

124
00:08:02,489 --> 00:08:04,088
免除一切责任了
of any responsibility.

125
00:08:08,827 --> 00:08:11,896
你以为会怎么样?
What did you think would happen?

126
00:08:11,898 --> 00:08:14,799
我们在集市上抓了人充数
We took them from the market instead,

127
00:08:14,801 --> 00:08:16,501
这都算在你头上
and that's on your head.

128
00:08:16,503 --> 00:08:19,604
他们是更该死吗?
Were they any more or less deserving of death?

129
00:08:46,866 --> 00:08:50,501
她有事情瞒着我们
She was holding something back.

130
00:08:50,503 --> 00:08:53,171
我知道的
I know she was.

131
00:08:53,173 --> 00:08:54,739
她会来找我们的
And she'll come.

132
00:08:54,741 --> 00:08:57,094
相信我 她会来的
Trust me, she'll come.

133
00:09:10,762 --> 00:09:15,830
我知道今天事态发展和计划的不太一样
I understand things didn't go entirely to plan today.

134
00:09:15,832 --> 00:09:19,834
你觉得他们有没有可能知道你要去
Do you suppose it's possible that they knew you were coming,

135
00:09:19,836 --> 00:09:22,270
因为有人警告过他们了?
that someone had alerted them?

136
00:09:25,341 --> 00:09:27,742
我... 我觉得没有
I don't... I don't think so.

137
00:09:27,744 --> 00:09:30,211
没... 没有迹象显示有人在我们来之前逃走
There... there was no sign that anyone had fled our arrival.

138
00:09:30,213 --> 00:09:32,547
但是 嗯...
But, um...

139
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:35,216
今天在集市里没有女人?
There were no women at the market today?

140
00:09:35,218 --> 00:09:38,686
男人们好像决定让女人躲到看不见的地方
The men seemed to have decided to keep women out of sight.

141
00:09:44,427 --> 00:09:46,594
我相信你 司提反
I trust you, Stephen,

142
00:09:46,596 --> 00:09:51,232
所以我想让你和腓利照顾营地
which is why I want you and Philip to look after the camp.

143
00:09:53,169 --> 00:09:56,037
真的吗?
Really?

144
00:09:56,039 --> 00:10:01,443
它壮大得太快了 还有那么多人前来投奔
It's growing so fast, and we have so many new converts.

145
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,614
彼得 我从十三岁开始
Peter, I've been reading and studying scripture

146
00:10:06,616 --> 00:10:07,649
就在研读圣经
since I was 13.

147
00:10:07,651 --> 00:10:09,751
整本书我都烂熟于心
I know entire pages by heart,

148
00:10:09,753 --> 00:10:12,253
我可以用四种不同的语言说话 阅读 写字
and I can speak, read, and write in four different languages.

149
00:10:12,255 --> 00:10:13,755
现在 神给我们每个人都有旨意
Now, God has a purpose for each of us.

150
00:10:13,757 --> 00:10:15,156
你有你的 我有我的
You've got yours, and I have mine.

151
00:10:15,158 --> 00:10:18,693
但是这不是神对我的旨意 我应该去传道
And that is not it. I'm meant to preach.

152
00:10:22,598 --> 00:10:23,698
司提反
Stephen.

153
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,036
也许我可以让你好好利用你的学识
Maybe I can put your knowledge to good use.

154
00:10:47,823 --> 00:10:50,525
伊娃?
Eva?

155
00:10:55,164 --> 00:10:59,434
相信我 我不知道他在哪里
Believe me, I don't know where he is.

156
00:10:59,436 --> 00:11:03,405
但他...
But he...

157
00:11:03,407 --> 00:11:05,907
他说他要去一个地方
He said he was going to a place

158
00:11:05,909 --> 00:11:09,177
那儿的人会原谅他的罪过
where people would forgive his sins.

159
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:11,746
跟我来
Come with me.

160
00:11:17,853 --> 00:11:19,754
你把我带到这里来干什么?
Why have you brought me here?

161
00:11:19,756 --> 00:11:21,590
我... 我知道的都告诉你了
I... I've told you what I know.

162
00:11:21,592 --> 00:11:22,757
是的 但是...
Yes, but...

163
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:25,093
如果我的丈夫空手而归
If my husband returns empty-handed,

164
00:11:25,095 --> 00:11:26,628
我就只能考虑
I will be forced to consider whether

165
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,996
你是不是故意误导我们
you deliberately misled us

166
00:11:27,998 --> 00:11:30,398
还有你到底隐藏了什么真相
and then what truth you might conceal.

167
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,866
我已经把真相告诉你了
I've told you the truth.

168
00:11:31,868 --> 00:11:33,268
那就希望他在那儿吧
Let's hope he's there, then.

169
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,974
走
Go.

170
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:58,760
神说 要有光 就有了光
God said, "let there be light," and there was light.

171
00:11:58,762 --> 00:12:00,829
这个词是"神"?
This is the word for "God"?

172
00:12:02,566 --> 00:12:04,265
非常好
Very good.

173
00:12:17,113 --> 00:12:21,116
我们确信彼拉多想抓的人就在这里
We believe the man Pilate wants is here.

174
00:12:21,118 --> 00:12:22,817
他的名字叫波阿斯
His name is Boaz.

175
00:12:24,086 --> 00:12:26,321
你认识他...
You know him...

176
00:12:26,323 --> 00:12:27,455
是吧?
don't you?

177
00:12:29,859 --> 00:12:32,360
他曾经来寻求结盟
He once sought an alliance.

178
00:12:32,362 --> 00:12:34,462
如果他在这里 你就必须要让他受到法律制裁
If he's here, you must allow him to face justice.

179
00:12:34,464 --> 00:12:36,931
没错
Yes.

180
00:12:36,933 --> 00:12:38,967
如果他在这里的话
If he's here.

181
00:12:40,569 --> 00:12:44,039
要不要我提醒你 如果你不把他交出来
Need I remind you that if you fail to hand him over,

182
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,840
罗马的军队就会为他而来
Rome will come for him

183
00:12:45,842 --> 00:12:48,410
并在须臾之内让这个营地灰飞烟灭
and wipe this camp from the earth in less than an hour.

184
00:12:48,412 --> 00:12:50,979
如果罗马人觉得他在这里 我们早就死了
If the Romans thought he was here, we'd be dead already.

185
00:12:50,981 --> 00:12:53,114
你自己尽管去找他好了
You are welcome to look for him yourself.

186
00:12:53,116 --> 00:12:55,050
不要考验我的耐心!
Do not test me!

187
00:13:00,456 --> 00:13:03,391
这里有成百无辜的民众
There are hundreds of innocent people here.

188
00:13:03,393 --> 00:13:07,829
我为他们向神祈祷 你是个诚实可信的人
I pray to God for their sake you're truthful.

189
00:13:20,476 --> 00:13:22,644
你... 你杀了一个人
You... you've taken a man's life.

190
00:13:22,646 --> 00:13:24,112
你是个杀人犯
You're a killer.

191
00:13:24,114 --> 00:13:26,681
你也是 我听说有一对夫妇被杀了
As are you. I hear a husband and wife were murdered.

192
00:13:26,683 --> 00:13:28,617
你真的以为是我干的 你觉得我有这个能力?
Do you really think that was me, that I have that power?

193
00:13:28,619 --> 00:13:32,187
只有神才能决定谁生谁死
Only God decides who lives and dies.

194
00:13:32,189 --> 00:13:33,788
是神和罗马人
God and Romans.

195
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:36,625
我杀的那个人手里有过多少犹太人的人命?
How many Jewish lives have fallen to the man I killed?

196
00:13:36,627 --> 00:13:39,995
这个理由不够 你没法为谋杀辩护!
That's not good enough. You cannot justify murder!

197
00:13:39,997 --> 00:13:42,163
那你为什么不把我交给该亚法?
Then why didn't you give me up to Caiaphas?

198
00:13:42,165 --> 00:13:45,433
因为只有神才能决定谁生谁死!
Because only God decides who lives and dies!

199
00:13:45,435 --> 00:13:48,904
没人能强迫我决定一个人的命运!
I will not be compelled to decide a man's fate!

200
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:59,848
我可以收留你
I will harbor you.

201
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:04,552
但是我不能 也不会
But I cannot and will not

202
00:14:04,554 --> 00:14:08,823
强迫你去自首
force you to surrender.

203
00:14:12,261 --> 00:14:17,298
我们在这里的信念的基础
The foundation of what we believe in here

204
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,868
就是爱...
is love...

205
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:22,737
爱所有人
for all people.

206
00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:27,876
我唯一能做的...
All I can do...

207
00:14:27,878 --> 00:14:29,878
是宽恕你
is forgive you.

208
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,815
即便你知道罗马人一定会来找我
Even though you know Rome will surely come for me

209
00:14:33,817 --> 00:14:35,517
并把这里夷为平地?
and destroy this place?

210
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,319
我信仰神
My faith is in God.

211
00:14:37,321 --> 00:14:40,855
如果那是他的意愿 我接受
If that's his will, then so be it.

212
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,751
大祭司
High priest.

213
00:15:09,753 --> 00:15:13,088
你是谁? 想干什么?
Who are you? What do you want?

214
00:15:14,423 --> 00:15:17,325
我就是你要找的人
I'm the man you're looking for.

215
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:25,025
我是波阿斯
I'm Boaz.

216
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,290
为什么总有一些人
Why is it that some men

217
00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:39,062
想方设法要摸老虎的尾巴呢?
are determined to pull the serpent's tail?

218
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:41,898
是活得不耐烦了?
Is it a death wish?

219
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,702
还是某种虚无缥缈的英雄主义?
Or is it some vague notion of heroism?

220
00:15:45,704 --> 00:15:49,105
"我就是..." 这个 那个 或是其他什么样的人
"I'm the man who..." this, that, or the other.

221
00:15:50,874 --> 00:15:52,442
英雄主义...
Heroism...

222
00:15:52,444 --> 00:15:55,712
只存在于儿童故事里
It's for children's stories.

223
00:15:55,714 --> 00:15:58,548
但是怪物...
But monsters...

224
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:01,184
怪物是真实存在的
Monsters are real.

225
00:16:01,186 --> 00:16:03,953
而且无法被消灭
And they cannot be slayed.

226
00:16:03,955 --> 00:16:09,292
招惹它们只会让其变本加厉 比之前更加凶残
Try, and they grow another head that bites back twice as hard.

227
00:16:09,294 --> 00:16:13,763
那么 应该做的是... 安抚它们
So, what to do... Placate them,

228
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:18,167
取悦它们 满足它们 直到它们又胖又懒
flatter them, feed them until they're fat and indolent,

229
00:16:18,169 --> 00:16:22,272
忘记了自己是怪物
and forget that they're monsters.

230
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:24,974
假以时日
And in time,

231
00:16:24,976 --> 00:16:29,779
它们就会离开
they move on.

232
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:33,750
你比我更瞧不起彼拉多
You despise Pilate more than I do.

233
00:16:33,752 --> 00:16:36,052
而且我知道
And I know that deep down,

234
00:16:36,054 --> 00:16:39,422
在你内心深处 你巴不得
you wish with all your heart

235
00:16:39,424 --> 00:16:44,427
我能成功杀死他
that I'd succeeded in killing him.

236
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:10,687
他在这儿 也许你想要见见他
He's here, if you want to see him.

237
00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:14,957
好让他死之前知道我背叛了他?
So that he'll die knowing that I betrayed him?

238
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,594
不管你信不信 他并不知情
For what it's worth, he didn't.

239
00:17:17,596 --> 00:17:19,595
他不是因为你被抓到的
He wasn't found through you.

240
00:17:19,597 --> 00:17:20,930
他是自首的
He surrendered.

241
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,614
你好像挺喜欢她的
You seem taken with her.

242
00:17:41,318 --> 00:17:44,754
我记得那是什么感觉
I remember how it feels.

243
00:17:44,756 --> 00:17:47,557
我在她这个年纪失去了妈妈
I was about her age when my mother died,

244
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:50,326
我再也不想又一次被人抛下
and I didn't ever want to be left alone again.

245
00:17:50,328 --> 00:17:55,198
今天你把她照顾得非常好
You've been wonderful with her today.

246
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,002
但你决不能认为她是你的责任
But you mustn't think she's your responsibility.

247
00:17:59,004 --> 00:18:01,905
但我理解她的感受
But I know how it feels.

248
00:18:01,907 --> 00:18:03,706
我知道她的需求
I know what she needs.

249
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,476
那么你认为你能给她那一切吗?
And do you think you can give that to her?

250
00:18:06,478 --> 00:18:09,045
总要有人去做 为何不能是我?
Somebody should. Why not me?

251
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:16,419
因为你自己都还只是个孩子呢 玛雅
Because you're still a child yourself, Maya.

252
00:18:16,421 --> 00:18:18,555
也许就是这样她才想要我陪着
Maybe that's why she wants me around.

253
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:21,090
因为我跟她很像
Because I'm like her.

254
00:18:21,092 --> 00:18:25,795
我不是成年人
I'm not an adult.

255
00:18:25,797 --> 00:18:27,163
而是朋友
I'm a friend.

256
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,567
我们终于抓到了波阿斯
We have Boaz, finally.

257
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:32,735
噢
Oh.

258
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,570
谢谢你来告诉我
Thank you for coming to me.

259
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,739
你这样会有风险吧
It was a risk.

260
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:40,343
不会 一切终于可以恢复原样了
No. Anything to at last get back to normality.

261
00:18:40,345 --> 00:18:42,812
原样?
Normality?

262
00:18:42,814 --> 00:18:45,215
是什么意思?
What is that?

263
00:18:45,217 --> 00:18:47,951
杀人犯会受到应有的惩罚
The murderer will be punished for his crime,

264
00:18:47,953 --> 00:18:49,452
报复行为也结束了
and the reprisals ended.

265
00:18:49,454 --> 00:18:52,322
而且还会恢复以前那种自然的平衡
And the natural balance of things will be restored.

266
00:18:52,324 --> 00:18:53,122
是这个意思吗?
Is that it?

267
00:18:53,124 --> 00:18:54,457
再说一遍?
I'm sorry?

268
00:18:54,459 --> 00:18:55,792
你似乎觉得在波阿斯这事发生前
You seem to think that before Boaz,

269
00:18:55,794 --> 00:18:57,427
一切都是理所应当的样子
everything was as it should be.

270
00:18:57,429 --> 00:18:58,928
以前很稳定啊
Well, there was stability.

271
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,698
我知道我们的民族之间有差异 但是...
I know our nations have their differences, but...

272
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,067
我们生活在罗马暴政的铁蹄之下...
We live under the heel of Roman tyranny...

273
00:19:04,069 --> 00:19:08,471
占领军耗尽了我们的资源
an occupying army that drains us of resources

274
00:19:08,473 --> 00:19:12,208
对我们肆意欺凌杀害
and doles out murder on a mass scale.

275
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,710
把我们变成奴隶
We are enslaved.

276
00:19:13,712 --> 00:19:16,446
但你现在是以自由之身站在我面前 不是吗?
But you stand here freely with me now, don't you?

277
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:18,448
这不过是因为你允许我这样做
Only because you allow me to.

278
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,983
而作为交换
And in return,

279
00:19:19,985 --> 00:19:22,885
你要我对你表示感激
you expect me to play the role of the grateful subject

280
00:19:22,887 --> 00:19:25,622
因为你也是他们的一员... 一个罗马人
because you are one of them... a Roman.

281
00:19:25,624 --> 00:19:27,323
你们才是问题所在
You are the problem.

282
00:19:27,893 --> 00:19:31,394
管好你的嘴巴 小贱人!
Bite your tongue, little snake!

283
00:19:31,396 --> 00:19:33,896
不要假装很了解我
Don't presume to know me.

284
00:19:33,898 --> 00:19:36,666
你会为此付出不菲的代价
That might prove a costly error.

285
00:19:36,668 --> 00:19:38,034
这个
There.

286
00:19:38,036 --> 00:19:40,503
看到了吗?
You see?

287
00:19:42,406 --> 00:19:46,809
至少我们了解自己处在什么样的地位
At least we know where we stand.

288
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,986
你怎么找到他的?
How did you find him?

289
00:19:56,988 --> 00:20:01,691
知识就是力量
Knowledge can be as effective as force.

290
00:20:12,069 --> 00:20:17,073
你就是凶手 证明给我看
You are the murderer. Prove it.

291
00:20:17,075 --> 00:20:19,142
告诉我你割的哪里
Show me where you struck.

292
00:20:20,277 --> 00:20:21,577
不
No.

293
00:20:21,579 --> 00:20:24,247
过来 在我身上
Here. On me.

294
00:20:27,151 --> 00:20:32,255
就这样 近一点
That's it. Closer.

295
00:20:33,991 --> 00:20:36,326
现在可以了
Now show me.

296
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:46,903
至少他死得很快
At least he died quickly.

297
00:20:50,441 --> 00:20:52,609
然而你...
Whereas you will die...

298
00:20:52,611 --> 00:20:58,014
会在很多天以后 才慢慢 慢慢死去 
very slowly over many, many days

299
00:20:58,016 --> 00:21:01,618
以儆效尤
as an example for all to see.

300
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:06,322
离得这么近感觉如何?
How does it feel to get this close?

301
00:21:07,525 --> 00:21:08,525
诱人犯罪
Tempting.

302
00:22:13,991 --> 00:22:18,795
你会为自己的所作所为 饱尝无尽的痛苦滋味
There will be no end to your pain for what you did.

303
00:23:02,987 --> 00:23:07,903
不仅波阿斯比我想要的早死了一个星期
Not only is Boaz dead one week sooner than I'd like him to be,

304
00:23:07,905 --> 00:23:11,273
你还让杀他之人逃之夭夭
you somehow have contrived to allow his killer to escape.

305
00:23:11,275 --> 00:23:13,075
作何解释!
Explain yourself!

306
00:23:13,077 --> 00:23:16,045
恕我无能
It was my failing.

307
00:23:16,047 --> 00:23:19,114
我本该料想到有人会杀他灭口
I should have anticipated an attempt to stop him talking.

308
00:23:19,116 --> 00:23:22,218
我本该在他射箭的屋顶安设人手
I should have placed men on the rooftops where he struck.

309
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,520
我的失误让他得以轻易逃脱
Failure to do so gave him an easy escape.

310
00:23:29,192 --> 00:23:35,231
这个让人厌烦的城市终于惹恼你了吗?
Is this cloying city finally getting under your skin?

311
00:23:35,233 --> 00:23:40,102
犯一个错可以饶过
A single mistake could be forgiven,

312
00:23:40,104 --> 00:23:43,339
但你犯得不只一个错吧?
but this isn't a single mistake, is it?

313
00:23:46,743 --> 00:23:48,911
我任凭你发落
I accept whatever punishment pleases you.

314
00:23:59,757 --> 00:24:01,924
从我的视线里消失
Get out of my sight.

315
00:24:11,401 --> 00:24:14,436
他是谁?
Who was he?

316
00:24:14,438 --> 00:24:17,640
一个信仰坚定的人
A man of great conviction,

317
00:24:17,642 --> 00:24:22,478
只可惜误入歧途
but tragically misguided.

318
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,948
让我们单独呆会
Leave us.

319
00:24:34,257 --> 00:24:39,528
# 神阿 求你救我 #
# Save me, o God #

320
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:43,165
# 因为众水要淹没我 #
# for the waters are come into my soul #

321
00:24:43,167 --> 00:24:50,406
# 我陷在深淤泥中 没有立脚之地 #
# I sink in deep mire where there is no standing #

322
00:24:50,408 --> 00:24:53,442
# 我到了深水中 #
# I am come into deep waters #

323
00:24:53,444 --> 00:24:56,512
# 大水漫过我身 #
# where the floods overflow me #

324
00:24:56,514 --> 00:25:00,049
# 我因呼求困乏 #
# I am weary of my crying #

325
00:25:00,051 --> 00:25:02,985
# 喉咙发干 #
# my throat is dried #

326
00:25:02,987 --> 00:25:08,791
# 我因等候神 眼睛失明 #
# my eyes fail while I wait for my God #

327
00:25:08,793 --> 00:25:13,929
# 无故恨我的 #
# they that hate me without a cause #

328
00:25:13,931 --> 00:25:19,268
# 比我头发还多 #
# are more than the hairs on my head #

329
00:25:20,537 --> 00:25:23,672
请不要论断眼前之人
Do not judge this man displayed here.

330
00:25:23,674 --> 00:25:25,808
那是神的职责
That's for God to do.

331
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:31,614
我们只能饶恕他的过犯
All we can do is forgive him,

332
00:25:31,616 --> 00:25:34,817
如同饶恕众人的过犯
as we must forgive all people,

333
00:25:34,819 --> 00:25:40,256
并向众人示爱
and show love to all men.

334
00:25:40,258 --> 00:25:44,827
只有彼时我们才能在我们的主 耶稣基督
Only then will we find salvation when our Lord, Jesus Christ,

335
00:25:44,829 --> 00:25:49,031
降临耶路撒冷 建立起一个新的神之国度时
returns to establish a new kingdom of God

336
00:25:49,033 --> 00:25:50,199
获得拯救 
in Jerusalem.

337
00:25:50,201 --> 00:25:51,201
带走他
Take him.

338
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,481
要追他回来吗?
Shall I stop him?

339
00:26:05,483 --> 00:26:07,850
不用
No.

340
00:26:07,852 --> 00:26:10,352
让他去通风报信
Let him tell the others.

341
00:26:10,354 --> 00:26:11,987
他们自然会来搭救朋友
They'll come for their friend.

342
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:14,189
我们只需静候在此
And we will be waiting.

343
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:23,465
好吧 没事
All right. All right.

344
00:26:28,438 --> 00:26:31,774
这是干什么? 我们什么也没做
What is this? We haven't done anything.

345
00:26:31,776 --> 00:26:34,610
是还没有 但你们会的
No. But you will.

346
00:26:34,612 --> 00:26:35,811
逮捕他们!
Arrest them!

347
00:26:44,155 --> 00:26:47,656
彼得 你还好吧?
Peter. Are you all right?

348
00:26:47,658 --> 00:26:50,226
给我去那边!
Get out of here!

349
00:26:50,228 --> 00:26:53,162
你也是!
You too!

350
00:26:53,164 --> 00:26:54,697
彼得
Peter.

351
00:27:00,904 --> 00:27:04,406
这可不妙
This isn't good.

352
00:27:04,408 --> 00:27:08,310
他们在等着我们上门
They were waiting for us.

353
00:27:08,312 --> 00:27:12,848
我们将会遭受苦难
Something awful is going to befall us.

354
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:17,353
但这也将是神迹的开始
But it will mark the beginning of something wonderful.

355
00:27:34,638 --> 00:27:37,006
谢谢你结束他的痛苦
Thank you for making it swift.

356
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:43,212
这不是出于仁慈
It was not done out of kindness.

357
00:27:43,214 --> 00:27:47,516
而是为了拯救他人 波阿斯知道这点
It was to save lives. Boaz knew that.

358
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:52,021
可以牺牲他
He was expendable.

359
00:27:55,025 --> 00:27:58,260
你需要人取代他
You'll need to replace him.

360
00:28:00,697 --> 00:28:02,832
我现在也参与进来了
I'm in this now, too.

361
00:28:02,834 --> 00:28:06,969
教导我 如同你教导波阿斯一样
Teach me, like you taught Boaz.

362
00:28:08,071 --> 00:28:09,705
教我如何杀人
Show me how to kill.

363
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:07,196
我的朋友... 时机到了
My friends... it's time.

364
00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:27,516
他要带我们去哪里?
Where is he taking us?

365
00:29:27,518 --> 00:29:28,978
去神殿
To the temple.

366
00:29:41,721 --> 00:29:45,758
我们的民族已被毒害 从仇恨中回头吧
Our nation is poisoned. Turn away from hate.

367
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,560
从暴力中回头吧
Turn away from violence.

368
00:29:47,562 --> 00:29:49,629
耶稣是世上的光
Jesus is the light of the world.

369
00:29:49,631 --> 00:29:51,664
- 阿门!  - 敞开心胸
- Amen!  - Open your hearts.

370
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:55,101
聆听对众生希望与爱的福音
Hear our message of hope and love for all people.

371
00:29:55,103 --> 00:29:56,235
加入我们
Come.

372
00:29:56,237 --> 00:29:57,870
耶稣是位好牧人
Jesus is the good Shepherd.

373
00:29:57,872 --> 00:29:59,505
倘若人们知道
People would not act this way

374
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:04,911
我主耶稣基督的国 将降临耶路撒冷
if they knew the kingdom of our Lord, Jesus Christ,

375
00:30:04,913 --> 00:30:06,679
便不会如此相待
is coming to Jerusalem.

376
00:30:08,283 --> 00:30:10,950
他是复活...
He is the resurrection...

377
00:30:10,952 --> 00:30:12,885
- 他 还有他 把他们带走!  - 是生命!
- Him. Him. Take them!  - And the life!

378
00:30:24,965 --> 00:30:28,334
我知道问你也是徒劳
I suppose it's thankless to ask,

379
00:30:28,336 --> 00:30:31,938
但我还是很想知道你是如何越狱的
but I'd very much like to know how you escaped your cell.

380
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:37,243
那么我只能假设
Then I can only assume

381
00:30:37,245 --> 00:30:39,745
你们懂一点撬锁
that you have some experience of lock-picking,

382
00:30:39,747 --> 00:30:41,781
大多数通晓事理的人都会把这种本事
a skill which most reasonable people

383
00:30:41,783 --> 00:30:45,017
与犯罪联系在一起
would associate with criminality.

384
00:30:46,587 --> 00:30:47,720
很好
Very well.

385
00:30:47,722 --> 00:30:49,856
你们被指控一直
You are accused of continuing

386
00:30:49,858 --> 00:30:52,692
奉假先知的名教训人
to teach the name of a false prophet.

387
00:30:52,694 --> 00:30:55,695
你们藐视神殿 阴谋把这座城里
You defy the temple and conspire to lead

388
00:30:55,697 --> 00:30:58,431
迷失的灵魂引入迷途
the lost souls of this city astray.

389
00:30:58,433 --> 00:31:00,900
你对此作何解释?
What have you to say to this?

390
00:31:02,504 --> 00:31:04,470
回答我!
Answer me!

391
00:31:06,174 --> 00:31:09,442
出于对犹太公会博学多识的长老们的尊重
Out of respect for the learned elders of the Sanhedrin,

392
00:31:09,444 --> 00:31:12,912
我们无意辩解我们的信仰
we will not seek to defend our beliefs.

393
00:31:12,914 --> 00:31:15,248
我们只知道其为真
We only know them to be true.

394
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:19,352
而真理无需辩解 澄清
There can be no defense or clarification

395
00:31:19,354 --> 00:31:22,789
又或是开脱... 真理即是真理
or mitigation of the truth... It simply is.

396
00:31:24,024 --> 00:31:26,526
那何谓你的真理?
And what is the truth?

397
00:31:27,861 --> 00:31:30,696
那便是神将耶稣从死里复活
That God raised Jesus from the dead

398
00:31:30,698 --> 00:31:34,834
坐在他的右边 叫他作君主 作救主
to sit at his right hand as prince and savior.

399
00:31:34,836 --> 00:31:38,971
正是他的圣灵替我们打开枷锁
And it was his Spirit that freed us from your chains.

400
00:31:38,973 --> 00:31:41,708
你可知说出如此僭妄之语
You are aware that saying such things

401
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:45,044
根据律法将把你当假先知定罪
condemns you as false prophets, according to the law.

402
00:31:45,046 --> 00:31:48,748
只会有一种结果
There is only one outcome.

403
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:52,452
那就是将你们以乱石砸死
You are to be put to death by stones.

404
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:57,156
就这么几句话...
So few words spoken...

405
00:31:57,158 --> 00:32:01,561
就要处死这么多人
for so many lives to be clipped.

406
00:32:01,563 --> 00:32:02,929
迦玛列拉比
Rabbi Gamaliel,

407
00:32:02,931 --> 00:32:05,865
你是发现我们在适用的法律有什么错吗?
do you find fault in our application of the law?

408
00:32:05,867 --> 00:32:07,734
不不不 应该不是
No, no, no, probably not.

409
00:32:07,736 --> 00:32:11,237
但是作为犹太公会的主席
But as president of the Sanhedrin,

410
00:32:11,239 --> 00:32:16,843
我有义务去干涉
I'm obligated to poke a finger into matters

411
00:32:16,845 --> 00:32:18,177
引起我关注的事情
that pique my interest.

412
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:19,979
理所当然 但这事还有什么好说的?
Of course, but what more is there to say?

413
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:21,614
他们已被判有罪...
They've been found guilty of...

414
00:32:21,616 --> 00:32:23,616
是的 是的 这真叫人心里不安
Yes, yes, yes, yes. It's all very upsetting.

415
00:32:23,618 --> 00:32:27,286
但是我很好奇 难道你就没想起
But I wonder, do you not recall

416
00:32:27,288 --> 00:32:29,922
你自己年少时的那份热情
the enthusiasms of your own youth

417
00:32:29,924 --> 00:32:32,692
并为之神往吗?
and being carried away by them?

418
00:32:32,694 --> 00:32:37,830
大家对您的智慧赞赏有加 但是...
Your wisdom is highly valued and recognized by all, but...

419
00:32:37,832 --> 00:32:40,433
但是我现在该坐回去了 是吗?
But I should sit down now, should I?

420
00:32:40,435 --> 00:32:42,635
不 不 我不能
No, no, I cannot.

421
00:32:42,637 --> 00:32:45,972
为了你我 我的良心刺痛了我
My conscience pricks at me for us both.

422
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:52,945
任凭他们去吧
Let these men alone.

423
00:32:54,415 --> 00:32:56,916
他们并不是危险分子
They are not dangerous.

424
00:32:56,918 --> 00:33:03,656
假如他们所言虚假 那就不会有任何事发生
If what they claim is false, then nothing will come of it.

425
00:33:03,658 --> 00:33:08,428
假以时日 他们也就四散了
And in time, they will simply fade away.

426
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:13,299
但假如所言为实 而你们将之毁灭
But if it is true and you destroy them,

427
00:33:13,301 --> 00:33:16,536
恐怕你们自己
you will find yourselves

428
00:33:16,538 --> 00:33:20,206
倒是攻击神了
in opposition to God.

429
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,902
迦玛列所言甚是
Having considered the wisdom of Gamaliel,

430
00:33:49,904 --> 00:33:54,073
同意改变你们的判决
it is agreed that the sentence shall be commuted.

431
00:33:58,345 --> 00:34:01,881
但是你们仍会被公开处以鞭刑
But you're to be taken to a public place and flogged

432
00:34:01,883 --> 00:34:05,685
好让你们的罪行公诸于众!
so that everyone may know your guilt!

433
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:28,875
你若不听从耶和华 你神的话
If you do not obey the Lord, your God,

434
00:34:28,877 --> 00:34:32,512
不谨守遵行他的一切诫命律例
and do not carefully follow all his commands and decrees,

435
00:34:32,514 --> 00:34:37,216
你在城里必咒受诅 在田间也必咒受诅
you will be cursed in the city and cursed in the country.

436
00:34:37,218 --> 00:34:41,954
你身所生的 地所产的
The fruit of your womb will be cursed.

437
00:34:41,956 --> 00:34:45,391
以及牛犊 羊羔
The crops of your land, the calves of your herds,

438
00:34:45,393 --> 00:34:47,827
都必受咒诅
the lambs of your flocks.

439
00:34:47,829 --> 00:34:51,864
你出也受咒诅 入也受咒诅
You will be cursed when you come in and cursed when you go out.

440
00:34:52,901 --> 00:34:54,667
他必在你手里所办的一切事上
The Lord will send on you

441
00:34:54,669 --> 00:35:00,173
使咒诅 扰乱 责罚临到你
curses, confusion, and rebuke in everything you put your hand to

442
00:35:00,175 --> 00:35:03,976
直到你被毁灭 速速地灭亡
until you are destroyed and come to sudden ruin

443
00:35:03,978 --> 00:35:07,146
因为你行恶离弃他
because of the evil you have done in forsaking him.

444
00:35:25,538 --> 00:35:28,839
我们都知道总要付出一点牺牲
We all knew we'd have to make sacrifices.

445
00:35:28,841 --> 00:35:33,311
这是耶稣告诉我们的 司提反
That's what Jesus told us, Stephen.

446
00:35:33,313 --> 00:35:35,513
不是这样的牺牲
Not like this.

447
00:35:50,996 --> 00:35:53,764
我们能不能回家...
Shall we go home...

448
00:35:53,766 --> 00:35:58,336
去加利利吗?
To Galilee?

449
00:35:58,338 --> 00:35:59,904
你是说去那生活吗?
You mean to live?

450
00:35:59,906 --> 00:36:03,608
为什么不呢?
Why not?

451
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:07,178
营地建好了 正在发展壮大
The camp's set up. It's growing.

452
00:36:08,982 --> 00:36:11,148
你不需要再待在这了
You don't need to be here anymore.

453
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:14,719
这就是你想要的吗?
Is that what you want?

454
00:36:14,721 --> 00:36:17,355
是的
Yes.

455
00:36:17,357 --> 00:36:21,325
但是你做不到 是吗?
But you can't do it, can you?

456
00:36:26,299 --> 00:36:28,532
你在家的时候...
When you're at home...

457
00:36:29,835 --> 00:36:32,403
捕鱼 卖鱼
you catch fish, you sell them.

458
00:36:32,405 --> 00:36:33,971
清扫船只
You clean a boat.

459
00:36:33,973 --> 00:36:38,709
我可以做 谁都可以做
I can do that. Anyone can.

460
00:36:40,445 --> 00:36:43,214
但是在这不一样
But it's different here.

461
00:36:45,617 --> 00:36:49,921
你与众不同
You're different.

462
00:36:49,923 --> 00:36:51,622
甚至你的名字都与众不同
Even your name's different.

463
00:36:53,893 --> 00:36:58,429
你是彼得 独一无二
You're Peter. No one else can be.

464
00:37:00,333 --> 00:37:02,133
所以我才要回家
And that's why I'm going home.

465
00:37:07,674 --> 00:37:09,307
什么时候走?
When?

466
00:37:11,843 --> 00:37:15,580
明天
Tomorrow.

467
00:37:15,582 --> 00:37:18,683
他玛认定我是唯一一个
Tamar's decided that I'm the only one

468
00:37:18,685 --> 00:37:20,585
能护她周全的人 而且...
that can keep her safe, and...

469
00:37:22,488 --> 00:37:25,623
在这儿我保护不了她
and I can't do that here.

470
00:37:34,433 --> 00:37:36,434
我会想你的
I'm going to miss you

471
00:37:36,436 --> 00:37:39,604
你不会知道我有多想你
more than you will ever know.

472
00:38:03,495 --> 00:38:09,200
我们要根据我们的法律来管理自己
We must govern ourselves according to our law

473
00:38:09,202 --> 00:38:12,503
这样这个城市以及它的人民
so that this city and its people

474
00:38:12,505 --> 00:38:17,742
将不再受到罗马法律的制裁
are never again subjected to Roman justice.

475
00:38:17,744 --> 00:38:22,847
这样好倒是好
That's all well and good.

476
00:38:22,849 --> 00:38:24,482
但是依我所见
But as far as I understand it,

477
00:38:24,484 --> 00:38:27,885
这个波阿斯自愿被捕
this Boaz surrendered of his own accord.

478
00:38:27,887 --> 00:38:31,289
是这些人宣称遵守摩西律法吗?
Are these the men that claim to keep the law of Moses?

479
00:38:33,425 --> 00:38:37,361
你们... 你们受了天使所传的律法
You... you who have received the law through angels

480
00:38:37,363 --> 00:38:42,233
竟不遵守!
but have not obeyed it!

481
00:38:42,235 --> 00:38:44,135
你们都跟我们的祖先一样
You're all just like our ancestors.

482
00:38:45,804 --> 00:38:48,406
哪一个先知 不是他们逼迫呢?!
Was there ever a prophet they didn't persecute?!

483
00:38:48,408 --> 00:38:49,574
够了!
Enough!

484
00:38:49,576 --> 00:38:51,108
为什么要这么做?
What is the cause of this?

485
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:53,511
义者受到了不公的处罚
The unjust punishment of righteous men.

486
00:38:53,513 --> 00:38:55,146
小心你的措辞
Hush your tongue.

487
00:38:55,148 --> 00:38:58,883
那是在神的眼下 神的殿里执行的判决
The sentence was levied under the eyes of God in his house.

488
00:38:58,885 --> 00:39:01,085
哦 你是说这个神殿?
Oh, you mean this temple?

489
00:39:02,722 --> 00:39:06,190
你真相信 能创造万物的神
Do you really believe that God would confine himself

490
00:39:06,192 --> 00:39:09,860
会把自己限制在一所人造的屋子里吗?
to a house built by men, when he made all of creation?!

491
00:39:09,862 --> 00:39:11,529
哦 你说话小心一点 你可是一个人在这
Oh, you be careful. You're alone in here.

492
00:39:11,531 --> 00:39:13,364
难道耶稣没有在
And didn't Jesus say,

493
00:39:13,366 --> 00:39:16,133
你将他处死而他又复活前说过
"I will tear down this temple and rebuild it in three days"

494
00:39:16,135 --> 00:39:18,536
"我能拆毁神的殿 三日内又建造起来"吗?!
before he rose from the death you condemned him to?!

495
00:39:18,538 --> 00:39:19,971
让他安静 让他闭嘴
Silence him. Shut him up.

496
00:39:19,973 --> 00:39:22,106
看啊 和我一起看!
Look. Look here with me!

497
00:39:22,108 --> 00:39:25,443
我看见天开了 基督站在神的右边
I see the heavens open and Christ standing at the right hand of God!

498
00:40:08,555 --> 00:40:11,189
杀了这个亵渎神灵的人! 杀了他!
Kill the blasphemer! Kill him!

499
00:40:43,455 --> 00:40:46,491
求主耶稣接收我的灵魂
Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.

500
00:40:48,393 --> 00:40:50,528
不要将这罪归于他们
Do not hold this sin against them.

501
00:41:52,613 --> 00:41:54,114
这是权利与信仰的对抗
It's power versus faith.

502
00:41:54,777 --> 00:41:55,335
烧了它
Burn it.

503
00:41:55,754 --> 00:41:57,400
就在这场史诗般的对决
In one epic showdown.

504
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,189
让我们见证新生的火焰烧得愈加璀璨
Let's see new fire burns brightest.
