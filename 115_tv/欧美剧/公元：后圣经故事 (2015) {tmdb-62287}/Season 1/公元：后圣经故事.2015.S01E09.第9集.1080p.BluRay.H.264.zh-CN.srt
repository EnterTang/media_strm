我已经不是那个你们理应憎恨的人了

来啊
Do it.

11

你在期待罗马的新职位吗?

跪下!! 跪拜你的新大帝!

扫罗已经成了耶稣的信徒了

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,310
你不能在犹太会堂传耶稣的道

每个城门都有人带着武器把守

33
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,500
他们在叫你的名字

34
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,800
巴拿马 那太不可思议了
Barnabas, that was incredible.

35
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,880
就因为你 犹太会堂里都骚乱了
You turned the Synagogue into a riot.

36

走这里
This way.

39
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,790
我能通过城门守卫 可扫罗你不行
I can get past the guards on the gate, Saul, but you can't.

40
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,040
关闭城门!

这说不通 怎么可能是扫罗
This doesn't make sense. Saul of all people.

49
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,460
他突然就疯了
He just went mad.

50
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,410
前一刻他还正常 而下一刻...
One moment he was normal, and then the next...

51
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,410
这可不是发疯 这是背叛
This isn't madness. This is betrayal.

52
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,740
- 他是真心实意的吗?  - 这有什么要紧?
- Did he seem genuine?  - What does it matter?

53
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,700
他侮辱了你
He's insulted you.

54
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,280
他的信念看上去非常坚定 是的
His conviction seemed sincere, yes.

找到他

56

还不跪下?
Why aren't you kneeling?

59

我的丈夫和我...
My husband and I...

67
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,710
没问他
Not him.

68
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,530
我不在乎他 我问的是你
I don't care about him. I'm asking you.

69
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,830
你怎么表现你的忠贞?
How would you show your devotion to me?

70
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,300
我...
I...

71
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,770
我...
I...

72
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,480
奥勒留!
Aurelius!

73
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,250
臣在 大帝 有何事?
Yes, dear Emperor?

74
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,140
她不喜欢我
She doesn't like me.

75
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,470
我的妻子和我忠贞...
My wife and I devo...

76
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,350
不 她不喜欢我
No. She doesn't.

77
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,740
显而易见
It's obvious.

78
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,920
你喜欢我吗?
You like me?

79
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,850
我敬仰您
I worship you.

80
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,050
敬仰
Worship.

81
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,630
我喜欢这个词
I like that.

82
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,550
哪怕我听说你在背后议论我?
Even though you were heard talking about me?

83
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,370
不
No.

84
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,030
你怎么说的?
What were the words?

85
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:44,210
我相信他说您是疯子
I believe he said you were insane.

86
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:45,930
我绝不会说...
I would never say...

87
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:50,070
奥勒留 你是深受我叔叔信任的谋士
Aurelius, you were my uncle's trusted adviser.

88
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,230
是的 我也绝不会说...
Yes, and I would never say...

89
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,100
他也谈起过我吗?
Did he talk about me, too?

90
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,500
你是不是和他一起嘲笑我?
Did you laugh at me together?

91
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:59,050
这些都是别有用心的谣言
These are malicious rumors.

92
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,220
你忠诚吗?
Are you loyal?

93
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,150
毫无疑问

94
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,510

Do you love me?

95
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,330
爱您
I do.

96
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,950
跟爱我叔叔一样多吗?
As much as you loved my uncle?

97
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,440
当然
Of course.

98
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:16,920
但你宣誓永远效忠于他
But you swore eternal devotion to him.

99
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,200
牺牲性命也在所不辞
You offered up your life.

100
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,810
没错 我... 我也将如此对您
I did. A... and I do the same to you.

101
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:22,740
哪怕牺牲性命?
Your life?

102
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,760
是的
Yes.

103
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,780
那就亮剑吧
Then show me your sword.

104
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,770
你的命
Your life.

105
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,680
为了罗马
For Rome.

106
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,500
为了大帝
For my Emperor.

107
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,340
愿神喜悦我的行为
May the Gods smile on my actions.

108
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,130
我厌倦了耶路撒冷
I am bored with Jerusalem.

109
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,850
巡抚 我好像还记得我们之间的争论
I seem to remember an argument between us, Governor.

110
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,050
平身
Stand up.

111
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,520
不过是场误会
It was a simple misunderstanding.

112
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,060
此地令人不悦
This is an irritating region.

113
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,040
食物劣质
The food is vile,

114
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,520
天气炎热
it's too hot,

115
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,930
对罗马或对我均无爱戴之情!
and there is no love for Rome or me!

116
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,780
你理应改变这一切
You shall change that.

117
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,720
我想也许可以...
I thought perhaps...

118
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,270
造个雕像
a statue.

119
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,340
没错
Yes.

120
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:23,210
在罗马全境立起您的雕像
Statues of you across the Empire,

121
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,220
从高卢直到埃及
from Gaul to Egypt.

122
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,460
好
Yes.

123
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,790
在这房间里我们就该立一座
We shall have one in this very room.

124
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:30,830
当然
We will.

125
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:35,260
我还在想神殿里也该立一座
I also thought we will have one in the temple.

126
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,220
代表我供万人瞻仰
My likeness in the temple for all to see.

127
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,040
以此作为开始
That will be a start.

128
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:48,770
好
Yes.

129
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,150
我们走吧
Let's go.

130
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,420
多美啊 是吧?
It's so beautiful, isn't it?

131
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,900
对 没错 请问我们能走了吗?
Yeah, it is. Can we keep moving, please?

132
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,040
事物之壮美竟能如此恒久 多棒啊
Amazing how something can seem so wondrous for so long,

133
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,150
然后...
and then...

134
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,850
我很想多跟你谈谈
You know, I'd love to discuss this more,

135
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,520
不过也许不要站在马路中央
perhaps when we're not standing in the middle of the street

136
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,010
人来人往都能看见
for everyone to see.

137
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:31,770
我们得去送别大帝了
We need to say our goodbyes to the Emperor.

138
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,110
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,130
为何?
For what?

140
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,330
为他看你的眼神
The way he looked at you.

141
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,650
进来
Yes.

142
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,320
有人请我来此
I was sent for.

143
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,080
对 塑造雕像的事
Yes, business with statue.

144
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,350
怎么了?
What of it?

145
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,740
他下令的时候我看见你的样子了
I saw you when he announced it.

146
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,140
你的表情
I saw your face.

147
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,610
那是因为酒坏了
The wine was off.

148
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,590
要是真这么做你知道后果如何
You do know what will happen if he sends it.

149
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,950
耶路撒冷会暴乱
Jerusalem will riot,

150
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,950
我的士兵会镇压成千上百的人民
and my soldiers will kill thousands.

151
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,880
他的雕像还会玷污了神殿
And the statue would desecrate the temple.

152
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,650
你倒是不在乎
Not that you'd care.

153
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:21,010
对 但你在乎
No, but you do.

154
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,460
我能看出来
I see that.

155
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,370
所以你可以阻止他
So you could stop it.

156
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,450
凭我?
Me?

157
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,830
跟他谈谈 劝阻他
Talk to him. Persuade him.

158
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:29,900
我可不这么认为
I don't think so.

159
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,110
但他是你的朋友
But he's your friend.

160
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,800
他现在是皇帝了
He's the Emperor now.

161
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,420
好吧
All right.

162
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,530
勉力一试
I'll try.

163
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,560
我会带他回罗马
I'll take him back to Rome,

164
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,670
也许等他离开这里
and maybe once he's away from here,

165
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,690
就会将此事抛诸脑后
he'll forget all about it.

166
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,960
要是连大帝最亲密的朋友也害怕
If the Emperor's closest friend is too frightened

167
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,850
提及此事...
to approach the subject...

168
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,630
会有办法的
We will find a way.

169
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,940
你如何能控制住一个狂人?
How do you control a madman?

170
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,200
这不是你一个人的问题
This is not just your problem.

171
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,470
这是整个犹太的问题
This is a problem for all Judea.

172
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,480
那又怎样?
So?

173
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,210
找人共同分担
So we share the burden.

174
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,380
彼得
So. Peter.

175
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,900
对 你知道我在想...
Yeah, you know, I was thinking...

176
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,110
也许我应该先行前去跟他们谈谈
perhaps I should go ahead and, uh, talk to them.

177
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,490
谈什么呢?
Well, what's to talk about?

178
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,230
我们现在都是信耶稣的兄弟了
We're all brothers in Christ now.

179
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,530
我可不确定他们也这么看
I'm not entirely sure they see it that way.

180
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,710
哦 你想太多了
Oh, you worry too much.

181
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,840
扫罗
Saul.

182
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,340
他来耶路撒冷了
He's here in Jerusalem.

183
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,040
有个神殿守卫看见他进了城
One of the temple guards spotted him entering the city.

184
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,140
找到他
Find him.

185
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,470
应该就是此处了
This must be the place.

186
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,800
你等在外面
Wait here.

187
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,310
让我先跟他们谈谈
Let me talk to them first.

188
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,970
然后再带你上去
And then I'll bring you up.

189
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,020
好的
Right.

190
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,500
将发生的一切如实告知他们
You tell them everything that happened

191
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,380
一字一句复述我的话 好吗?
just the way I told you, yes?

192
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,080
- 一字一句  - 好
- Word for word.  - Good.

193
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,650
我有点紧张
I'm a little bit nervous.

194
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,250
等在这
Wait here.

195
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,780
等着
Wait.

196
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,860
他已洗心革面
He's a changed man.

197
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,440
没人能有如此大改变
No one can change that much.

198
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,060
先见见他 同他谈谈
Just meet him. Talk with him.

199
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,880
- 不行  - 你太傻了
- No.  - You're an idiot.

200
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:31,010
你究竟明不明白你做了什么?
Don't you see what you've done?

201
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:33,130
不
No.

202
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,190
哦 糟了 糟了
Oh, no, no.

203
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,410
看来这里就是你们所有人的藏身之所了
So, this is where you're all hiding now.

204
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,090
你好 兄弟
Hello, brothers.

205
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:48,780
你可不是我的兄弟
You're no brother of mine.

206
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,550
你一个人吗?
Are you alone?

207
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:53,030
当然 我发誓我对你们没有威胁
Of course. I'm no threat, I swear.

208
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,730
- 西门兄弟  - 别这么叫我
- Brother Simon.  - Don't call me that.

209
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,040
你真的相信他已经转信耶稣了吗?
Do you really believe that he has turned to Christ?

210
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,810
我相信
I do.

211
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:02,110
他的信仰之火灼灼发光
His faith burns very brightly.

212
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,840
也许有点太旺了
Maybe a little too brightly.

213
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,290
我理解你为什么害怕
I understand your fears.

214
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,430
真的
I do.

215
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,830
但我已经受洗再世为人了
But I have been baptized and made new again.

216
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,890
- 哦 真的吗?  - 多马
- Oh, have you now?  - Oh, Thomas.

217
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,270
在去大马士革的路上 耶稣显身在我面前
I was on the road to Damascus when Jesus visited me.

218
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,880
你不配呼他的名!
You don't get to speak his name!

219
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,000
西门 请听他说
Simon, please.

220
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,960
我们正当有所成就 有所建造
We were getting somewhere, building something,

221
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,770
然后你追随而来 将一切摧毁殆尽
and then you came along, and you burnt it all down.

222
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:25,860
没错
Yes.

223
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,430
然后呢?
And?

224
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,270
然后我现在改信基督了
And now I turned to Christ.

225
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,900
他总是这样吗?
Is he always like this?

226
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,580
只有当他清醒的时候
Only when he's awake.

227
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,180
出去
Get out.

228
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,240
扫罗
Saul.

229
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,570
彼得 约翰
Peter. John.

230
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,880
好极了
How wonderful.

231
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,010
我正发愁没法让人理解我
I was having trouble making myself understood.

232
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,590
你已经改信基督
You've turned to Christ.

233
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,360
彼得 这不对 我知道
Peter, this is not right. I know it's not.

234
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,590
我知道这看起来像什么样子
I know how this looks.

235
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,980
但我... 我可以为他作保
But I... I can vouch for him.

236
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:00,500
我想和他单独谈谈 就我和你
I want to talk to him alone. Just me and you.

237
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,660
我和你
Me and you.

238
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,450
我们从你去大马士革说起
We'll start on the road to Damascus.

239
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,250
巴拿马不是已经和你说过...
Why hasn't Barnabas already talk...

240
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,270
我想听你亲口说
I want to hear it from your mouth.

241
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:28,100
彼得 我们应该开始计划...
Peter, we need to start planning...

242
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,180
我要你无所保留 从头讲起
You are going to tell me everything from the beginning.

243
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,360
但是我是你同信基督的兄弟
But I am your brother in Christ.

244
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,910
从头讲起
From the beginning.

245
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,990
就好像我一直都眼盲
It was like I'd always been blind,

246
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,180
而现在第一次目明了
but now I saw for the very first time.

247
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,210
你不相信我 对吧?
You don't believe me, do you?

248
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,170
- 你曾想杀死我  - 确实
- You wanted me dead.  - I did.

249
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,780
所以你应该理解我的谨慎
So you'll understand my caution.

250
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,800
对
Yes.

251
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,170
但这一切确实有点荒谬
But this is all a bit ridiculous, surely.

252
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,820
我知道自己做过什么 彼得
I know what I've done, Peter.

253
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,180
但在楼下听你说了这么多
But listening to you all downstairs,

254
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,280
好像你已经忘记
it was like you'd forgotten

255
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,250
耶稣教过你要宽容
that Jesus had taught you forgiveness.

256
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,130
我是说 你跟他同住 知道他说过的话
I mean, you lived with him. You know his message.

257
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,830
所以... 抱歉 但我不明白
So... so, sorry, but I'm confused.

258
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,840
你说得对 我确实与他同住过
You're right. I did live with him.

259
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,740
所以别教训我了
So don't start lecturing me.

260
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:17,810
他是什么样的?
What was he like?

261
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:20,650
他是我最好的朋友 老师
He was my best friend and my teacher

262
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:24,710
我的兄弟 我的主和主人
and my brother and my lord and master.

263
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,950
他曾是...
He was...

264
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:31,930
他是纯粹的爱
He is pure love.

265
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,510
我想念他
I miss him.

266
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,770
我不
I don't.

267
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,320
我感觉得到他... 就在这里
I feel him... in here.

268
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,580
他的精神在我心中燃烧
His spirit burns within me.

269
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,930
我们都被圣灵降临过
We've all been visited by the holy spirit.

270
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,850
我也感觉得到他
And I feel him, too.

271
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,220
我只是希望有时
I just wish sometimes

272
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,270
事情能稍微明了些
that things were a little clearer.

273
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,150
对我而言已经非常清楚了
It's all perfectly clear to me.

274
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,140
真的吗?
Really?

275
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,240
对
Yes.

276
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,360
我是迦玛列的学生
I am a student of Gamaliel.

277
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,020
我是一名法利赛学者
I am a Pharisaic scholar,

278
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,680
而你与我天赋不同
while you have different talents.

279
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:17,270
但在耶稣的连结下 我们可以携手创造奇迹
But together, bound by Jesus, we can work wonders.

280
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,840
你看不出来吗?
Don't you see?

281
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,370
你怎么能跟他一同生活过
How can you have lived with him,

282
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,530
听过他的言语 触摸过他的圣体
heard his message, touched him,

283
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,280
却仍不明事理呢?
and still not see?

284
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,130
有人在下城区看到他了
He was seen in the lower city.

285
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:36,040
本来我确定能抓到他 但还是被他逃脱了
I was sure that we would have him, but he evaded capture.

286
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,830
你还要被这个人愚弄几次?
How many times must this man make a fool of you?

287
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,350
我要搜遍全城每寸土地 直到抓到他
I will comb every inch of the city until he is caught.

288
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,140
我会找到他的 我发誓
I will find him. I swear.

289
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:57,420
如果大帝您完事了 那就该走了!
If the Emperor is finished, then it's time to leave!

290
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,560
这么快?
Already?

291
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:02,130
你在罗马可以找到质量更好的
You will find a much higher quality in Rome.

292
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,030
更饥渴热切的
Much more eager.

293
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,730
我等不及回家了
I can't wait to be home.

294
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,270
彼拉多那个傻瓜怎么样了?
What about that fool, Pilate?

295
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,100
- 他想要什么?  - 哦 没什么
- What did he want?  - Oh, nothing.

296
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,950
就是更加诚惶诚恐而已
Just more groveling.

297
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,280
快 马等着呢
Come on. Your horse is waiting.

298
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,740
我跟你比赛谁先到约帕 
I'll race you to Joppa.

299
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,620
那个女孩不怎么喜欢我
That girl didn't like me very much.

300
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:26,100
祝陛下旅途一路顺风
May our Emperor have a safe and uneventful journey.

301
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,570
万岁 凯撒!
Hail, Caesar!

302
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,850
- 没事了  - 不!
- It's all right.  - No!

303
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,390
没事了 大比大
It's all right, Tabitha.

304
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,230
是我 他已经走了
It's me. He's gone.

305
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,240
结束了
It's over.

306
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,410
结束了
It's over.

307
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,270
现在如何?
What now?

308
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:11,810
我还以为终于能安生点了
I thought we might finally have some peace.

309
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:14,330
大帝已经启程离开了
Well, our Emperor has departed.

310
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,060
但他给耶路撒冷留了一份大礼
But he has left a present for Jerusalem.

311
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,410
实际上 是专门给大祭司的大礼
In fact, it is specifically for the High Priest.

312
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,500
哦?
Oh?

313
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,680
大帝的一座雕像
A statue of his likeness.

314
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,300
他要求放在神殿里
Which he commands to be placed in the temple itself.

315
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:33,080
你也可以将之视作其神威和权柄的警示
As a reminder, if you wish, of his divinity and his power.

316
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,980
这雕像会玷污了神庙
A graven image would defile the temple

317
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:38,000
破坏我们最神圣的戒律
and break one of our most sacred commandments.

318
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,940
他... 不能这么做
He... he cannot do this.

319
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,970
但他已然如此
And yet he does.

320
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,240
但以理书预言过此种时刻
The Book of Daniel foretells a moment such as this,

321
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,940
会招致死亡和毁灭
and it promises death and destruction.

322
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,840
现在你有了新的神 一位罗马人
Well, now you have a new god, and he is Roman.

323
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:53,660
你手上沾满了成千上百人的血 彼拉多
Well, you have the blood of thousands on your hands, Pilate.

324
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,980
再多几千又何妨?
What's a few thousand more?

325
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,510
只要你控制好自己的人民就没事 所以
Not if you control your people, which is why

326
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,170
你要以客人身份跟我留在这里...
you will stay with me here as a guest...

327
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,560
提醒他们希律王和他的罗马同盟
to remind them of the strong bond

328
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,610
之间的纽带牢不可破
between the Herod and his Roman allies.

329
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:07,680
这可不是玩玩政治手段
This is not about political maneuvering.

330
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,010
我们说的可是神庙的毁灭!
This is about the destruction of the temple!

331
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,480
你能小声点吗?
Will you keep your voice down?

332
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,360
我们肯定能达成共识的一点是
The one thing I'm sure we can agree upon

333
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,690
此事不能公之于众
is that this cannot become public knowledge.

334
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,420
要是狂热教徒听说了此事
If the Zealots heard about this,

335
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,370
明早我们脚下就要尸体成堆了
we'd be knee-deep in corpses by morning.

336
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,400
巡抚 我们一直都在合作
Governor, we've always worked together

337
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,020
谋求共同点
to find a common ground.

338
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,920
我把你不喜欢的人钉在十字架上 而你...
Well, I crucify your undesirables, and you...

339
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,830
你又做了什么?
What do you do?

340
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,990
你难道忘了不久前还来找我
Has it been so long since you came to me

341
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:42,520
说我们是一荣俱荣 一损俱损吗?
and told me that we stand and fall togeher?

342
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:47,340
真的需要我提醒你 我为了这个地区的和平
Do I really need to remind you of all that I've done

343
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,530
所做的一切吗?
to ensure peace in this region?

344
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:55,640
该亚法 这是大帝的愿望
Caiaphas, this is the emperor's wish.

345
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,120
这不是我的问题 是你的
It isn't my problem. It's yours.

346
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,250
看着办吧
Deal with it.

347
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,690
一定还有别的办法解决这件事
There has to be a different way to approach this.

348
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:07,650
如果我们齐心协力来维护这个地区的稳定
If we work together to keep the region stable

349
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:11,230
与安宁还有... 几乎不招惹注意
and calm and... invisible, almost,

350
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,760
那我想大帝
then I think the emperor

351
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,680
会为其他事分心
may well be distracted by other things.

352
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,230
那倒挺容易的
That should be easy.

353
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,840
我们已经至少一星期没有骚乱了
We haven't had a riot here for at least a week.

354
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,140
这还不够
That's not enough.

355
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,900
得有人牺牲
You need blood.

356
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:31,010
仅仅安宁稳定是不够的
It's not enough to be quiet and stable.

357
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,500
当然可能稍有裨益
Although, it might help.

358
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,350
你的卡里古拉喜欢鲜血的滋味
Your Caligula has a taste for blood.

359
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:40,130
所以我们找个人公开处死
So we find someone, destroy them very publicly,

360
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,620
并且让他知道
and let him know all about it.

361
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:44,410
那样看起来就像整个犹太团结一心
It will seem as if the whole of Judea is united

362
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,470
接受罗马作它的主人了
and accepts Rome as its master.

363
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,300
不过是演戏而已
It's a piece of theater, that's all.

364
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,530
那谁是替罪羊呢?
And who is this scapegoat?

365
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:56,550
你们有没有听说过大数人扫罗?
Have either of you heard of a man called Saul of Tarsus?

366
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,280
他是谁?
Who is he?

367
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,980
他曾是个好人
He was a good man.

368
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,900
但他被拿撒勒人腐蚀了
But he was corrupted by the Nazarenes,

369
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,260
如今他... 成了渎神者 是我们共同的威胁
and now he is a... a blasphemer and a danger to us all.

370
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,110
威胁?
A danger?

371
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:12,400
据我所知 拿撒勒人的信仰是很平和的
From what I understand, the Nazarene faith is a peaceful one.

372
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:17,280
他们宣称耶稣是王 而非你们的大帝...
They claim Jesus is king, not your emperor...

373
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:22,860
说他是弥撒亚 神 而非你的卡里古拉
that he is the Messiah, a God, not your Caligula.

374
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,270
这是对罗马权威赤裸裸的挑战 不是吗?
It's a direct challenge to Rome's authority, is it not?

375
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,870
当你想想因为无谓地处死耶稣
When you consider all the trouble caused

376
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,990
而引起的所有麻烦...
by the needless execution of Jesus...

377
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,530
不是无谓的 一点也不
Not needless. Not needless at all.

378
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,730
我以为我们是来讨论
I thought we were here to discuss

379
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:39,090
你口中自己深爱的城市和人民
the destruction of the city that you claim to love so well

380
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:41,120
遭受毁灭屠杀的事
and the massacre of your people.

381
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,310
而这就是你能想到的?
And this is all you can offer?

382
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:48,590
拜托 告诉我... 你要怎么做?
Please, tell me... what will you do?

383
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:51,950
不 亲爱的...
No, my dear...

384
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,890
巡抚夫人 压迫我们民族的人
wife of the governor and depressor of our nation.

385
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,600
问题该是 你要怎么做?
The questions is, what will you do?

386
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,130
你知道 在来这的路上我非常兴奋
You know, when I was coming here, I was so excited.

387
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,850
巴拿巴跟我说了你好多事
Barnabas had told me so much about you.

388
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:16,810
没错 我知道我们以前是什么关系
And yes, I know what we were to each other before.

389
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,750
但我想... 我真心地想
But I thought... I genuinely thought

390
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,550
当我见到你的时候 你会比任何人都...
that when I saw you, you more than anyone...

391
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,890
我本以为我们的会面将不可思议
I thought it would be incredible.

392
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,660
而你却只是坐在那儿评判我
But you just sit there and judge me.

393
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:32,870
你说他为什么选择了你?
Why do you think he chose you?

394
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:35,350
因为没有人能够阻止我抓你
Because nobody could have stopped me from getting to you

395
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,030
除了他 
except him.

396
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:46,630
让我们出去
Let's go out.

397
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,650
让我们去宣扬他的福音
Let's preach his message.

398
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,490
现在我们可以露面了
Now we can go out.

399
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,320
因为你 我们东躲西藏!
Because of you, we've been hiding!

400
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:03,910
你就不能放下这事吗?！
Will you never let this go?!

401
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,420
你们怎么没人践行自己所宣扬的道?
Do none of you practice what you preach?

402
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,530
- 没那么简单!  - 没有吗?!
- It's not that easy!  - Isn't it?!

403
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,890
尽管你们内心都有最伟大的馈赠
You all bicker and prattle like children

404
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:13,780
却全像孩子一样斗嘴吵闹!
when inside each of you is the greatest gift!

405
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,390
而你们必须与人类分享那馈赠!
And you have to share that with mankind!

406
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,940
你一定要! 我也是!
You have to! And I have to, too!

407
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,270
你威胁我女儿了!
You went after my daughter!

408
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:23,400
没错
Yes, I did.

409
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,190
我过去一直在伤害你 彼得
All I've ever done is hurt you, Peter.

410
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,420
耶稣应该杀了我 但他没有
Jesus should have struck me down, but he didn't.

411
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,670
他原谅了我
He forgave me.

412
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,850
而我也必须请求你的原谅
And I must beg you for your forgiveness, too.

413
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:41,300
他难道从来无需原谅你什么吗 彼得?
Has he never had to forgive you for anything, Peter?

414
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,240
要知道 当亚拿尼亚来我家的时候
You know, when Ananias came to my house,

415
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,070
他说是耶稣派他来的
he told me that Jesus had sent him.

416
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,600
他告诉亚拿尼亚我会受折磨...
He told Ananias that I will suffer...

417
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,060
我会为他之名受折磨
that I will suffer for his name.

418
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,340
我绝不会原谅自己对你的所做所为
Oh, I will never forgive myself for what I did to you,

419
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,610
但我很害怕...
but I am scared...

420
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:10,130
我害怕现在所受的苦
I am so scared that the pain I feel right now

421
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:13,840
比起将来的苦根本不值一提
is nothing compared to what will come.

422
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:20,450
逃跑是更轻松的选择 但我不能那么做
It would be easier to run, but I can't.

423
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:24,800
现在...
Now...

424
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:30,970
我们能开始了吗?
can we begin?

425
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,310
我在找人
I'm looking for someone.

426
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,240
大数人扫罗
Saul of Tarsus.

427
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:48,480
他在老城
Old town.

428
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,310
我们不能走
Well, we can't go.

429
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,250
我们哪也不能去
We can't go anywhere.

430
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:04,010
我们是困在我父亲宫殿里的囚徒
We are prisoners in my own father's palace.

431
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,130
那我们留下来
So we stay.

432
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:08,230
又如何呢?
And do what?

433
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:13,150
等雕像一到 就会血流成河
When that statue arrives, there will be carnage.

434
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:15,790
我们会因为与罗马的关系
We'll be ripped to pieces

435
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,210
而被碎尸万段
because of our association with Rome.

436
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,160
所以我们必须做好准备
So we must prepare.

437
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,090
准备?
Prepare?

438
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,450
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

439
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,120
罗马帝王的雕像
A statue of the Roman emperor

440
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,900
要放置在我父亲的神庙中
will be placed in my father's temple,

441
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,100
神庙将受到玷污
and it will be defiled.

442
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,150
对 耶路撒冷人会奋起反抗 战争一触即发
Yes, and Jerusalem will rise up, and there will be war.

443
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,110
没错
Exactly.

444
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,700
所以我们要回到加利利
So we need to be back in Galilee.

445
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,030
走得远远的
Far away.

446
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,010
不
No.

447
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,370
你还不明白吗?
Don't you see?

448
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,890
彼拉多绝不可能逃过此劫
There is no way that Pilate can survive this.

449
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,490
等雕像到达之日 你作为加利利的希律王
When the statue comes, you, the Herod of Galilee,

450
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:57,010
必须在这里准备好取而代之
must be here, ready to take his place,

451
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,200
夺回本该属于你的东西
reclaim what it rightfully yours,

452
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,200
除掉耶稣的信徒 永绝后患
and get rid of these Jesus followers once and for all.

453
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,670
谁在那儿?
Who's there?

454
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:15,300
彼得干嘛还跟扫罗说话?
Why is Peter even talking to Saul?

455
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,240
巴拿巴替他说好话
Barnabas has vouched for him.

456
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:20,460
但正如你所言 我们的主为什么拣选他?
But as you said, why would our Lord pick him?

457
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:21,770
感觉不对
Doesn't feel right.

458
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:22,760
我不知道
I don't know.

459
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,020
耶稣总是出乎我们意料 不是吗?
I mean, Jesus was always surprising us, wasn't he?

460
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,840
大祭司想召见大数人扫罗谈话
The high priest wishes to speak with Saul of Tarsus.

461
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:32,490
我相信他就藏在你们中间
Now, I believe that he is hiding here amongst you

462
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:33,860
就躲在这附近
in this neighborhood.

463
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,470
要是有人知道他在哪儿
If anyone knows where this man is,

464
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,870
那最好现在就告诉我
then they would do well to tell me now.

465
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:51,980
玛利亚?
Mary?

466
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:53,940
我要...
I need...

467
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,310
我要立刻见彼得
I need to see Peter now.

468
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:59,740
我... 我马上得走
I... I have to go now.

469
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:03,120
你能... 我本来要去送干净亚麻布的
Can you... I was supposed to deliver fresh linen.

470
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,830
我来帮你做 放心
I'll do that. It's fine.

471
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,330
怎么回事? 他们有危险吗?
What is it? Are they in danger?

472
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,210
是的
Yes.

473
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,440
不 我... 我不... 我们都有危险
No. I... I... I don't... we all are.

474
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,120
或许
Maybe.

475
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,180
我不确定
I don't know.

476
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,160
慢着
Oh, wait.

477
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,710
给你
Here.

478
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,780
- 为了我们的事业  - 约亚拿...
- For the cause.  - Joanna...

479
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,700
请收下
Please.

480
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,470
我也想帮忙
I want to help.

481
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,080
谢谢
Thank you.

482
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:37,730
我会尽快回来
I'll be back as soon as I can.

483
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,280
尽快...
As soon as...

484
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,510
那是...?
Was that...?

485
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:49,200
约亚拿 刚那女人是把钱拿走了吗?
Joanna, did I just see that woman take money?

486
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:56,680
那些钱我们不需要 我们还有很多
We don't need it, we have plenty of money.

487
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,180
钱是给谁?
Who is it for?

488
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:04,630
给那些信徒 帮助他们传道用
The Apostles, to help them spread the word.

489
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,010
传...
The word...

490
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,040
耶稣的道?
of Jesus?

491
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,920
在发生了这一切之后?
After everything's that's happened?

492
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,800
是的
Yes.

493
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,390
在你说我疯了之后
After you called me insane.

494
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:18,320
但是救了你的命
And saved your life.

495
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:22,430
这是我的信仰 苦撒
It is my faith, Chuza.

496
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:27,410
我的爱人... 我感到绝望
My love... I despair.

497
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,750
在遇到耶稣之前 你恬静 善良 像其他人一样
Before Jesus, you were quiet and good and like all the rest.

498
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,700
但是现在...
But now...

499
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,730
我不知该拿你如何是好
I just don't know what to do with you.

500
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,840
我不能再沉默下去
I cannot be silent.

501
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,870
你总是这么跟你丈夫说话吗?
Do you always talk to your husband like that?

502
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,010
当然
Of course.

503
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:03,050
谁告诉你能这么跟他说话的?
Who told you you could speak that way?

504
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:06,090
耶稣给我的力量
Jesus gave me the strength.

505
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,010
谁是耶稣?
Who is Jesus?

506
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:09,430
跟我说说他
Tell me about him.

507
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:18,410
我们该如何阻止他们?
How do we stop it?

508
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,240
我们会去的 对吧?
We are going to stop it, aren't we?

509
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,650
就凭我们去和罗马军队抗衡?
Us against the Roman army?

510
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:23,370
那是我们的神殿
It's our temple.

511
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,140
我是说我都不确定我们是否有能力 甚至有需要这么做
All I'm saying is I'm not sure if we can, even if we wanted to.

512
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,810
- 也许我们不该涉险  - 什么?
- Maybe we shouldn't try.  - What?

513
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:30,420
但以理书...
The Book of Daniel...

514
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:33,340
- 约翰  - 但以理书中早就预示了此种时刻
- John.  - The Book of Daniel foretells this moment.

515
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:36,400
"在神殿内 那行毁坏可憎的
"At the temple, he will set up an abomination

516
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,290
如飞而来"
that will cause desolation."

517
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,680
没错
That's right.

518
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,040
"必有一王
"The ruler who will come

519
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,090
来毁灭这城和圣所"
will destroy the city and the sanctuary."

520
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,160
那又如何?
So?

521
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,440
"至终必如洪水冲没
"The end will come like a flood.

522
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,090
必有争战 一直到底"
War will continue to the end."

523
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,430
没错 无休止的战争
Exactly. Eternal war.

524
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,260
耶稣在警示我们
Jesus warned us.

525
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,810
他认为事态会比想象中更严重
He said it'd be worse than anything ever imagined.

526
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:59,340
"直到所定的结局" 这可能就是结局
"Until the end." This could be the end.

527
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,860
- 你是说...  - 我不知道
- Are you saying...  - I don't know,

528
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,970
但是他确实是这么告诉我们的
but he did tell us.

529
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:04,310
是的 当那可憎之物立于
Yes, when the abomination stands

530
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:07,140
不属于它的地方 那么...
where it does not belong, then...

531
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,030
那么耶稣将会归来
Then Jesus will return.

532
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,530
我们找到他之后要杀鸡儆猴
When we find him, let's make a spectacle of the event.

533
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,040
让大家都瞧瞧
Let the world see what happens

534
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:26,050
背叛大祭司的下场
when you betray the high priest.

535
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:29,280
- 也许吧  - 也许?
- Maybe.  - Maybe?

536
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,020
这个男人让你蒙羞
That man is laughing at you.

537
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:36,380
没有见到他本人难下定论
Well, that's hard to know without seeing him in person.

538
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,540
噢 那显然你有更好的主意
Oh, so you have a better plan, clearly.

539
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:43,050
他是个学者 迦玛列的学生
He's a scholar. A student of Gamaliel's.

540
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,810
更重要的是 他也是犹太人
And, more importantly, a Jewish brother.

541
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:46,970
如你所说 我们是可以将其乱石砸死
We could have him stoned, as you suggest.

542
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:50,140
但是能让他回心转意不是更好
But how much better if we were to win him back

543
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,480
岂不也证明了神的大能?
and thereby prove the power of god?

544
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,070
你仅仅只想和他谈谈
You're just going to talk to him.

545
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:59,300
我要向全世界证明神殿真正的能力
I'm gonna show the world the true power of the temple.

546
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,080
该亚法
Caiaphas.

547
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,730
长久以来 我们定罪和责难他人
We've condemned and blamed

548
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,990
将自己的观点强加于别人头上 
and bludgeoned our opinion on others for too long.

549
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:06,830
并不奏效
It isn't working.

550
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:09,710
罗马在展示实力时可从不犹豫
Rome has no such qualms about showing its strength.

551
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:12,410
"不可报仇 也不可埋怨你本国的子民 
"Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge,

552
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,810
却要爱人如己"
but love your neighbor as yourself."

553
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:17,690
好吧 那你应该把利未记这本书献给大帝
Well, perhaps you should send the Book of Leviticus to the emperor,

554
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,530
反正你认为它可以解决我们一切问题
since you clearly seem to think it will solve all our problems.

555
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,720
我会和扫罗谈谈 然后再决定如何行事
I will talk to Saul, and then I'll decide what to do.

556
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:28,340
到那时 也就没有什么好争论的了
Till then, there's nothing more to discuss.

557
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:34,130
神殿内的雕像... 耶稣警告过我们
A statue in the temple... Jesus warned us of this.

558
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,500
我们得想个办法
We need a plan.

559
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:40,000
我们需要做些... 什么
We need to do... something.

560
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:44,660
抱歉在这种时刻还要让你为此事烦恼
Sorry to burden you with this on top of everything else.

561
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,550
扫罗怎么样?
How's Saul?

562
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:49,470
他...
He's...

563
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:52,960
让你恼火? 自负? 还是傲慢?
Irritating? Vain? Arrogant?

564
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:56,670
他煽动众人砸死司提反
He encouraged the crowd to stone Stephen.

565
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:59,630
威胁我的女儿
He came after my daughter.

566
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,240
带着人手穿越荒漠来杀我
He dragged men across the desert to kill me.

567
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,080
他说得好像自己领导一切 可他甚至都不了解耶稣
He talks like he's in charge, and he never even knew Jesus.

568
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,180
然而这并不要紧
But still, it shouldn't matter.

569
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,230
你相信他吗?
You believe him?

570
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,910
你要知道神殿守卫在缉拿他
You know the temple guards are hunting for him.

571
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:19,940
这就是最好的证明
That's proof in itself.

572
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,390
为什么你就不能接纳他呢?
Why didn't you welcome him in?

573
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,070
你告诉过我耶稣曾濯洗过你的双脚
You told me Jesus washed your feet once,

574
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,610
他是如何将万恶扭转
how he upturned the order of everything.

575
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,650
没有人是极弱 极穷 极恶的
No one was too weak, too poor, too sinful.

576
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,210
没人该被拒之门外
No one could be turned away.

577
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:38,680
哎 巴拿巴
Oh, Barnabas.

578
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:41,890
他不是那个傲慢的人 我才是
He's not the arrogant one. I am.

579
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:42,980
不
No.

580
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,590
为什么选他?
Why him?

581
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,120
开门!
Open up!

582
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:56,920
快开门!
Open the door!

583
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:57,870
开门!
Open up!

584
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,920
我说快开门!
Open up, I say!

585
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,970
我们在找大数人扫罗!
We're looking for Saul of Tarsus!

586
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:03,770
快开门!
Open the door!

587
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:04,650
开门!
Open up!

588
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,920
开门! 赶紧开门!
Open up! Open the door!

589
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,240
开门!
Open the door!

590
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,620
情况会有多糟?
How bad will it be?

591
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:15,040
如果我们计划周密 就可以限制伤亡人数
If we plan carefully, we can limit the loss of life.

592
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,690
- 限制?  - 是的
- Limit it?  - Yes.

593
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:18,490
- 限制到多少?  - 我们应该预估
- To what?  - We should assume

594
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:20,320
全境叛乱的情况
there'll be a full-scale rebellion.

595
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,420
那时恐怕罗马人的性命也难以保证
I fear there will be Roman lives lost, as well.

596
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,090
那意味着多少?
What does that mean?

597
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,880
几百? 还是上千?
Hundreds? Thousands?

598
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,850
- 我担心的是这并不是结束  - 对
- I fear that won't be the end of it.  - No.

599
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,770
我认为他们会多次尝试毁灭雕像
I imagine there will be several attempts to destroy the statue.

600
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:35,500
那么骚乱会持续几周 也许几个月
This will last several weeks, maybe months,

601
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:38,190
取决于他们多久才能接受现实
depending on how long it takes for them to accept it.

602
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,700
为什么要他们接受?
Why should they accept it?

603
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,210
- 克劳迪娅  - 不!
- Claudia.  - No!

604
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:44,730
我们必须阻止此事发生
We have to stop it coming.

605
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,010
怎么阻止?
How?

606
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,880
认真想想对策
We think. We plan.

607
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:50,000
你可是犹太省的巡抚
You're the governor of Judea.

608
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,660
这件事情无法阻止
It can't be stopped.

609
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,460
我们只能想想对策
We can only plan for its arrival.

610
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,570
我知道 我感同身受
I know. I feel the same.

611
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:57,000
但我们能做的有限
But that's all we can do.

612
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,350
我们必须增派守军
We must reinforce the garrison.

613
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,260
我没法相信你们
I can't believe you.

614
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,870
这可能是神殿的毁灭
This could be the end of the temple.

615
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,940
你们怎能只是袖手旁观并且...
How can you stand by and...

616
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,260
那你怎能不想耶稣回来?
How can you not want Jesus to return?

617
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,330
我当然想
I do. Of course I do.

618
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,420
但你们并不能确保
But you can't be sure of that.

619
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:35,080
答应我你们不会袖手旁观
Tell me you won't just sit by and watch it happen.

620
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:38,820
都不说话?!
Neither of you?!

621
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,170
西门
Simon.

622
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:43,430
好了 现在宣布个好消息
Well, now. Some good news.

623
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:50,580
我们欢迎扫罗... 成为我们信基督的兄弟
We welcome Saul... as our brother in Christ.

624
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:54,150
我有很多话要问你们
There is so much I need to ask you.

625
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:56,600
因为在楼上听完彼得的话
Because, listening to Peter upstairs,

626
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,510
我认为你们并没有完全
I'm worried you're not fully engaged

627
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,970
领会到耶稣的精髓
in Jesus' message.

628
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,510
你们都疯了
You've all lost your minds.

629
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,420
所有人
All of you.

630
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:07,360
- 这是我的错  - 不要去 扫罗
- This is my fault.  - No, Saul.

631
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:08,600
我必须要弥补
I have to make it right.

632
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:11,180
- 外面有神殿守卫 扫罗  - 我不在乎
- The temple guards, Saul.  - I don't care.

633
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:12,980
我跟过去
I'll go.

634
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,810
我去好一些
It's better that it's me.

635
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:30,730
西门!
Simon!

636
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:32,340
西门!
Simon!

637
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:35,830
要是你能听我一言 你就知道我是对的!
If you just listen to me, you'll realize I'm right!

638
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,320
开门! 扫罗!
Open up! Saul!

639
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,110
大数人扫罗!
Saul of Tarsus!

640
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:43,070
西门!
Simon!

641
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:44,940
西门!
Simon!

642
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:01,930
西门!
Simon!

643
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,000
西门!
Simon!

644
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,060
我就知道我会抓到你的
I knew I'd catch you.

645
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:57,280
因为你又蠢嗓门又大
You and your stupid loud mouth.

646
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:00,830
你就是不知何时应该闭嘴 是吗?
You just don't know when to shut up, do you?

647
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:19,120
再来点?
More?

648
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:23,350
我听说如果你想见某人
I've heard that if you want to meet certain people,

649
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:24,990
就该来这里
then this is the place to come.

650
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,700
罗马的敌人?
Enemies of Rome?

651
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,340
我得到重要消息
I have information,

652
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,530
需要告诉他们
and it is vital I get it to them.

653
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:40,980
要不然整座城市都将毁于一旦
The city will be destroyed otherwise.

654
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,040
战神马耳斯啊 倾听我的声音
Hear me, Mars.

655
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,990
请在此地停止你对战争的渴求
Please halt your lust for war in this place.

656
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,260
灶神维斯太啊 倾听我的声音
And hear me, Vesta.

657
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,810
请保佑我们家族不受到伤害
Please protect this household from harm.

658
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:06,260
抱歉 无意打扰
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to disturb.

659
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:07,990
留下来
Stay.

660
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,030
求你
Please.

661
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,420
你和我丈夫计划好了吗?
Did you plan well with my husband?

662
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:18,700
这座城市会毁灭吗?
Will the city be crushed?

663
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,440
我有命在身
I have my orders.

664
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,890
对 我忘了
Oh, I forgot.

665
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,460
你只是个士兵
You're just a soldier.

666
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:25,500
对
I am.

667
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,770
那你的人生肯定非常简单
How easy your life must be.

668
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:30,890
还有别的事吗?
Is there anything else?

669
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:32,460
没有了 退下吧
No. Go away.

670
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,230
等等
Wait.

671
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,250
我很害怕
I'm afraid.

672
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,970
你是如何做好准备去应对这种事的?
How do you prepare yourself for something like this?

673
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,360
我确信事情不会走到那步田地
I'm sure it won't come to that.

674
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:54,650
不
No.

675
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,240
在此之前我会被传召去罗马
I'll be called to Rome before then.

676
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,270
大帝一直盯着我
The emperor has fixed his eye on me,

677
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:03,890
他会用我来惩罚彼拉多
and he will use me to punish Pilate.

678
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:07,990
那你会怎么做?
What will you do then?

679
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:09,010
我会...
I would...

680
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:12,040
不会有这种事发生
I would not let that happen.

681
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:14,450
那如果是强制命令呢?
And if it were expressly ordered?

682
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:17,680
你会保护我吗?
Would you defend me?

683
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:22,710
我保证你的丈夫会为你而战
Your husband would fight for you, I'm sure.

684
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:26,290
你们男人
You men.

685
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,550
摧毁东西多容易
How easily you destroy things.

686
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,290
- 我只是...  - 我知道
- I'm just...  - I know.

687
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:33,740
我都知道
I know.

688
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,660
下去吧
Just go.

689
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:42,730
非常好
Yeah, very well.

690
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:39,090
带他上楼
Take him upstairs.

691
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,260
这是第一步
This is the first step.

692
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,910
你想走现在就可以走
You can get up and leave now if you want.

693
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:06,970
以后也不会再见到我
You'll never see me again,

694
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:08,560
我们不会来打扰你
and we'll let you live in peace.

695
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,750
我要和你们领头的谈谈
I need to talk to your leader.

696
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,790
神殿的未来在此一举
The future of the temple depends on it.

697
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:16,410
我知道波阿斯死了
I know Boaz is dead.

698
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:18,300
波阿斯从来都不是我们领头的
Boaz was never our leader.

699
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,920
第二步会带你跨过那道槛
The second step takes you across the threshold.

700
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,950
这之后就没法回头了 西门
There's no return after that, Simon.

701
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:24,060
你认识我?
You know me?

702
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,660
我们知道你属于哪派
We know what you are.

703
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,190
我们也接受你的信仰
And we accept your beliefs.

704
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:30,290
如果你迈出第二步
We will protect you, and you will protect us

705
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:33,560
我们将会保护你 你也会保护我们
if you take the second step.

706
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,120
好的
All right.

707
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,240
行
Yes.

708
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:03,370
那... 说吧
So... talk.

709
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,950
"我们日用的饮食 今日赐给我们
"Give us this day our daily bread,

710
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,330
免我们的债 如同我们免了人的债
and forgive us our trespasses

711
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,000
如同我们免了人的债
as we forgive those who trespass against us.

712
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:20,260
不叫我们遇见试探
and lead us not into temptation,

713
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:22,610
救我们脱离凶恶
but deliver us from evil.

714
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,400
阿门"
Amen."

715
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,200
我要杀一个人
I want a man be killed.

716
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,800
这群人中是否会有一人...
Will one of the parcels...

717
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:40,800
你把他带来给我们
I want you to bring him to us.

718
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:43,100
最终背叛?
Commit the ultimate betral?

719
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:44,900
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.
