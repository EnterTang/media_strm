1
00:00:00,508 --> 00:00:02,408
应当处死!
He deserves to die!

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,277
这个人和"神的儿子"是一伙的!
This man walks with this "Son of God"!

3
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:07,546
我不是! 我不认识他!
I do not! I don't know him!

4
00:00:07,548 --> 00:00:09,749
啊!
Aah!

5
00:00:09,751 --> 00:00:12,985
我愿贡献出我自己的墓地 作为您儿子的安息之地
I would like to offer my own tomb as your son's final place of rest.

6
00:00:12,987 --> 00:00:15,087
他被处决是因为反复亵渎神明
He was killed for the repeated blasphemy

7
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:16,655
声称自己是弥赛亚
of claiming to be the Messiah.

8
00:00:16,657 --> 00:00:17,723
如果他是呢?
And if he was?

9
00:00:17,725 --> 00:00:20,626
一旦他们认识到你们的启示仍是威胁
Once the Romans realize your message remains a threat,

10
00:00:20,628 --> 00:00:22,261
他们会将你们连根拔除
they will root you out.

11
00:00:22,263 --> 00:00:25,798
那个拿撒勒人也不过是血肉之躯
The Nazarene was only ever flesh and blood.

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,302
我要你在亚利马太的坟墓布下寺庙的守卫
I want you to post temple guards at Arimathea's tomb.

13
00:00:29,304 --> 00:00:30,937
必须封死墓穴
It must remain sealed.

14
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:35,675
在第三日 他保证会起死回生
On the third day, he promises to rise from death.

15
00:00:35,677 --> 00:00:39,278
我会在墓穴外安排一个小的守卫队
I will post a small guard outside the tomb.

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,447
封条已经被破坏了
The Roman seal has been broken.

17
00:00:41,449 --> 00:00:44,183
坟墓已经打开了 那个拿撒勒人... 不见了
The tomb is now open, and the Nazarene... is gone.

18
00:00:44,185 --> 00:00:46,352
"不见了"是什么意思?
What do you mean, "gone"?

怎么了?
What is this?

30
00:01:16,517 --> 00:01:19,218
有人在昨晚侵入了那个拿撒勒人的坟墓
The Nazarene's tomb was raided overnight.

31
00:01:20,822 --> 00:01:23,254
那些罗马的卫兵呢?
What of the Roman guard?

32
00:01:23,256 --> 00:01:23,889
逃走了
Fled.

33
00:01:23,891 --> 00:01:25,658
你在耍我吗?
Do you take me for a fool?

34
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,694
墓地被一块巨大的石头封住了
A massive stone sealed that tomb.

35
00:01:28,696 --> 00:01:29,996
仅仅一个人
One man alone

36
00:01:29,998 --> 00:01:31,497
是绝对推不动它的
could never have moved it.

37
00:01:31,499 --> 00:01:32,999
肯定有很多人
There must have been many.

38
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:36,168
那你看见了几个人?
So, how many did you see?

39
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,236
只有一个 但他不是凡人 
One, but it wasn't human.

40
00:01:38,238 --> 00:01:39,805
不可能!
Impossible!

41
00:01:58,026 --> 00:01:59,725
他们肯定在撒谎
They're clearly lying.

42
00:01:59,727 --> 00:02:01,694
不管怎样 我们不能让他们的话
Nevertheless, we cannot allow their account

43
00:02:01,696 --> 00:02:03,429
演变成危险的谣言
to be the basis of a dangerous rumor.

44
00:02:03,431 --> 00:02:06,332
那就快点想办法别泄露了风声
Then think quickly to ensure that it can't.

45
00:02:09,871 --> 00:02:14,104
如果被问起来 你们就说
If asked, you're only to repeat

46
00:02:14,106 --> 00:02:15,574
你们在执勤的时候睡着了
that you fell asleep on duty.

47
00:02:15,576 --> 00:02:17,443
你们在睡觉时候
And while you slept,

48
00:02:17,445 --> 00:02:20,746
那个拿撒勒人的门徒打开了墓穴
the Nazarene's men tore open the tomb

49
00:02:20,748 --> 00:02:22,948
并偷走了他的尸体
and stole his corpse.

50
00:02:24,485 --> 00:02:26,619
你们该庆幸没有因为玩忽职守
Count yourselves lucky your dereliction of duty

51
00:02:26,621 --> 00:02:30,156
被我的丈夫剥夺你们的神职
doesn't compel my husband to strip you of the priesthood.

52
00:02:30,158 --> 00:02:33,025
我再也不要见到你们
I never want to see you again.

53
00:02:38,232 --> 00:02:40,099
那个拿撒勒人的追随者
The Nazarene's followers

54
00:02:40,101 --> 00:02:42,468
妄图伪造他的复活
are attempting to fake his resurrection.

55
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,570
这件事怎么就没完了?
Why won't this business end?

56
00:02:44,572 --> 00:02:46,338
这个耶稣怎么就不能
Why couldn't this Jesus

57
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,807
继续当个死人呢?
just stay dead?

58
00:02:47,809 --> 00:02:50,776
你要保持头脑冷静 特别是现在
You need to keep a cool head, now more than ever.

59
00:02:50,778 --> 00:02:55,014
你一向以精明智慧著称 该亚法
You are celebrated for your shrewd intelligence, Caiaphas.

60
00:02:55,016 --> 00:02:58,150
在彼拉多发现事实真相
Draw on every last drop

61
00:02:58,152 --> 00:03:00,586
并且藉此来对付我们之前
before Pilate discovers what has happened

62
00:03:00,588 --> 00:03:05,024
得想尽一切办法
and uses it against us all.

63
00:03:07,695 --> 00:03:10,528
赶在那群加利利人宣扬他们的骗局之前
Find the Nazarene's body

64
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,098
找到那个拿撒勒人的尸体
before the Galileans begin to publicize their hoax.

65
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,136
我们应该把他的尸体吊在城墙外示众
We shall hang his corpse outside the city wall.

66
00:03:17,138 --> 00:03:18,704
真是松了口气
What a relief,

67
00:03:18,706 --> 00:03:21,674
终于能离开这鬼地方了
to be finally leaving this damned hole.

68
00:03:21,676 --> 00:03:23,542
我还从没像现在这样
I've earned my time

69
00:03:23,544 --> 00:03:25,878
挤出时间逃离这地方
away from this place like never before.

70
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,546
我中午就能收拾好行李
I'll be packed by midday.

71
00:03:27,548 --> 00:03:30,216
拜托 别弄这么久
Please, no longer.

72
00:03:30,218 --> 00:03:33,018
我可等不及让地中海的风
I can't wait for the Mediterranean winds

73
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,588
把你那些噩梦和无稽的幽灵之说
to blow away the last traces of your nightmares

74
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,523
给吹个一干二净
and apparitions.

75
00:03:37,525 --> 00:03:39,658
我的梦很清晰
My dream was clear.

76
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,962
你钉死的是受众神青睐的人
The man you crucified was favored by the gods.

77
00:03:42,964 --> 00:03:44,797
我们都会因为他的死而受苦的
We shall all suffer for his execution.

78
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,367
我们真得让你回归文明社会了
We really need to get you back to civilization.

79
00:04:02,683 --> 00:04:04,016
它空了
It's empty.

80
00:04:04,018 --> 00:04:05,184
什么?
What?

81
00:04:05,186 --> 00:04:08,420
那个墓穴
The tomb.

82
00:04:15,028 --> 00:04:15,861
早上好 巡抚
Good morning, Governor.

83
00:04:15,863 --> 00:04:18,164
确实挺好的
It was.

84
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:21,066
我想昨晚的地震没有打扰您睡觉吧?
I trust the tremor in the night didn't disturb your sleep?

85
00:04:21,068 --> 00:04:23,302
一点都没有
Not for a moment.

86
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:24,436
那么...
Now...

87
00:04:24,438 --> 00:04:26,505
你们怎么来了 先生们?
What brings you here, gentlemen?

88
00:04:26,507 --> 00:04:27,873
我想亲自过来
I wanted to come in person

89
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,376
感谢您这几个礼拜来 在那个拿撒勒人的事情上
to thank you for your guidance with the Nazarene

90
00:04:30,378 --> 00:04:31,443
对我的指导
these past weeks.

91
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:33,312
不必言谢
Your gratitude is unnecessary.

92
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,247
管理是我的职责所在
Governance is my job.

93
00:04:35,249 --> 00:04:37,917
今天是第三日了 对吧?
It is the third day, is it not?

94
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,752
对的
It is.

95
00:04:39,754 --> 00:04:41,520
他还是个死人吗?
And he remains dead?

96
00:04:41,522 --> 00:04:42,621
是的
He does.

97
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:45,457
就像我还有自然规律所预测的那样
As I and every law of nature predicted.

98
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:46,959
确实如此
Indeed.

99
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:49,195
不管我被安放在帝国的任何职位
Wherever I am posted in the empire,

100
00:04:49,197 --> 00:04:52,007
无论我的职位带来什么益处
whatever benefits occupation brings,

101
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:52,865
总是有些人
there are always those

102
00:04:52,867 --> 00:04:55,901
妄图挑战罗马帝国的权威
who seek to challenge the authority of Rome,

103
00:04:55,903 --> 00:04:58,670
而结局通常只有一个
and the outcome is usually the same.

104
00:04:58,672 --> 00:05:01,139
您的支持是莫大的帮助
Your support is a great help.

105
00:05:01,141 --> 00:05:05,411
当我面临严格与公正二选一的时候
When faced with the choice of being either firm or fair,

106
00:05:05,413 --> 00:05:11,150
我就明白了严格些通常更有益处
I've learned that firm generally pays the greater dividend.

107
00:05:11,152 --> 00:05:13,018
再见 先生们
Good day, gentlemen.

108
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,621
您走好
Safe passage.

109
00:05:15,623 --> 00:05:18,891
他还什么都不知道
He knows nothing.

110
00:05:18,893 --> 00:05:21,360
要不了多久他就知道了
We don't have long before he does.

111
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,128
我们必须找到尸体
We need to find that body.

112
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:26,232
- 我正在找  - 哼 那就找得更努力点
- I'm working on it.  - Well, work harder.

113
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:29,501
哦!
Oh!

114
00:05:31,906 --> 00:05:35,007
长官
Sir.

115
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,046
这是什么情况?
What is this?

116
00:05:41,048 --> 00:05:43,983
有个拿撒勒人坟墓的守卫有事想跟您报告
A member of the guard from the Nazarene's tomb to speak to you.

117
00:05:44,185 --> 00:05:45,751
他为何颤抖?
Why does he tremble?

118
00:05:45,753 --> 00:05:48,387
- 因为害怕 - 害怕什么?
- With fear. - Of what?

119
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:53,545
害怕您得知他跟我说的事后 可能会带来的后果
Of what may follow when he tells you what he told me.

120
00:06:12,219 --> 00:06:14,619
我就出价那么多
That is my price.

121
00:06:28,635 --> 00:06:30,335
好久不见了啊
Long time, no see.

122
00:06:40,012 --> 00:06:41,212
祭司
Priest.

123
00:06:41,814 --> 00:06:43,581
你想要什么?
What do you want?

124
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,750
这一刻 只要你听我说
For the moment, just your attention.

125
00:06:47,954 --> 00:06:52,590
接下来 要你帮忙找一具尸体
And then your help to find a corpse.

126
00:06:56,463 --> 00:07:00,298
主 我的神 你是以色列的希望
Lord our God, you are the hope of Israel,

127
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,467
谁若离弃你 必蒙羞耻
and all who forsake you shall be ashamed,

128
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:04,569
因为他们离弃了唯一的真神
for they have forsaken the one true God,

129
00:07:04,571 --> 00:07:07,339
离弃了生命水的源泉
the fountain of living water.

130
00:07:07,341 --> 00:07:09,274
你是有福的 主 我的神
Blessed are you, Lord our God.

131
00:07:09,276 --> 00:07:11,776
使我免于敌人的伤害
Protect me from my enemies

132
00:07:11,778 --> 00:07:14,112
使我前行的路上保持刚强
and keep me strong in the way ahead.

133
00:07:36,303 --> 00:07:37,802
你要求的每件事
What have I done

134
00:07:37,804 --> 00:07:41,206
我除了支持 可曾有过异议?
but support you in every way you asked?

135
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:47,045
我要抗议 您这是严重侵犯了我神圣的...
I must protest at this gross violation of my sacred...

136
00:07:47,047 --> 00:07:53,551
我究竟做了什么 竟招致这样的不敬?
What have I done to deserve such disrespect?

137
00:07:53,553 --> 00:07:57,322
如果您坚持要继续谈话
If you insist on holding a conversation,

138
00:07:57,324 --> 00:08:01,426
至少让我穿上衣服
at least allow me to dress.

139
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:08,900
待在水里
Stay in the water

140
00:08:08,902 --> 00:08:11,136
你这鳝鱼般油滑的人
like the eel you are.

141
00:08:11,138 --> 00:08:15,340
巡抚 我知道您在生气
Governor, I can see you're angry.

142
00:08:15,342 --> 00:08:19,544
你误导我相信
You led me to believe

143
00:08:19,546 --> 00:08:23,081
那个拿撒勒人的坟墓昨夜一切安好
the night passed peaceably at the Nazarene's tomb,

144
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:27,017
而我现在已经知道事实远非如此
which I know now is far from the truth.

145
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:27,652
巡抚...
Governor...

146
00:08:27,654 --> 00:08:32,891
今早你究竟有没有对我撒谎?!
Did you or did you not lie to me this morning?!

147
00:08:35,595 --> 00:08:37,729
我知道您有多期盼
I know how much you've been looking forward

148
00:08:37,731 --> 00:08:39,764
与您妻子一同到凯撒利亚去旅行
to traveling to Caesarea with your wife,

149
00:08:39,766 --> 00:08:41,933
而我本来相信我可以解决这个情况
and I believed I could resolve the situation

150
00:08:41,935 --> 00:08:43,735
而不会扰乱您的计划
without disrupting your plans.

151
00:08:43,737 --> 00:08:46,070
那结果如何?
And have you?

152
00:08:46,072 --> 00:08:49,707
我们正在采取行动
Action is under way.

153
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:55,180
同时 对耶稣的个人崇拜
Meanwhile, this Jesus cult

154
00:08:55,182 --> 00:08:57,882
每分每秒都在增长
grows stronger by the hour.

155
00:08:57,884 --> 00:08:59,617
要不了多久 它就会
Soon, it will draw

156
00:08:59,619 --> 00:09:02,554
把那些狂徒和叛乱分子全引到耶路撒冷来
every crackpot and revolutionary into Jerusalem

157
00:09:02,556 --> 00:09:05,123
他们一心一意就只想挑战我们所有人
with the sole aim of challenging us all.

158
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,692
我敢肯定 是那些加利利人偷走了尸体
The Galileans stole the body. I'm sure of it.

159
00:09:07,694 --> 00:09:10,094
我们要能找到他们 就能找到尸体
And if we find them, we'll find the corpse.

160
00:09:10,096 --> 00:09:12,397
向我报告他们的行踪
Send me the information on their whereabouts

161
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,900
立刻去办...
immediately...

162
00:09:15,902 --> 00:09:20,404
我会亲自处理这件事情 一次性给解决干净
And I will deal with this matter once and for all.

163
00:09:20,406 --> 00:09:21,840
我这就去办
I shall.

164
00:09:42,427 --> 00:09:43,127
我不明白
I don't understand.

165
00:09:44,464 --> 00:09:47,298
这怎么可能呢?
How is this possible?

166
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:02,113
我们就把他安放在这里
We laid him here.

167
00:10:02,115 --> 00:10:04,582
谁会这么想方设法地弄走他的尸体?
Who would go to such lengths to take his body?

168
00:10:04,584 --> 00:10:06,985
杀了他还不够... 他们还得彻底擦去所有痕迹
Killing him wasn't enough... They had to wipe out all trace.

169
00:10:06,987 --> 00:10:08,686
但这裹尸布... 是叠好的
But the shroud... It's folded.

170
00:10:08,688 --> 00:10:11,289
我想不出究竟有谁会...
I don't know who could have...

171
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,691
- 为什么破坏掉罗马政府的封条?  - 我不知道
- Why break the Roman seal?  - I don't know.

172
00:10:13,693 --> 00:10:16,127
今天正是第三日
It is the third day.

173
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:22,033
你敢相信吗?
Do you dare to believe?

174
00:10:43,123 --> 00:10:44,722
你发现什么了?
What did you find?

175
00:10:44,724 --> 00:10:48,693
没有... 我们什么都没发现...
Nothing... We found nothing...

176
00:10:48,695 --> 00:10:50,528
但什么都清楚了
And everything.

177
00:11:48,088 --> 00:11:49,821
你为何要哭?
Why are you crying?

178
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:56,060
- 是你把他带走了吗?  - 谁?
- Have you taken him?  - Who?

179
00:11:56,062 --> 00:12:01,532
如果是你把他带走了 求你
If you've taken him, please,

180
00:12:01,534 --> 00:12:03,534
告诉我在哪儿...
tell me where...

181
00:12:03,536 --> 00:12:06,404
我会去找他
and I will get him.

182
00:12:06,406 --> 00:12:09,741
玛利亚...
Mary...

183
00:12:21,721 --> 00:12:24,124
拉比
Rabbi.

184
00:12:36,231 --> 00:12:39,065
我们发现石头滚在一边
We found the rock rolled back,

185
00:12:39,067 --> 00:12:40,733
罗马人的封印也被破坏了!
the Roman seal broken!

186
00:12:40,735 --> 00:12:42,602
- 要是彼拉多认为是我们干的...  - 他为什么这么想? 
- If Pilate thinks we're responsible...  - why would he?

187
00:12:42,604 --> 00:12:45,104
除了我们谁还会冒这么大险把他的尸体运回来?
Who else would take that kind of risk to get his body back?

188
00:12:45,106 --> 00:12:48,241
约翰相信先知以赛亚的预言解释了所发生的一切
John believes Isaiah's prophecy explains what's happened.

189
00:12:48,243 --> 00:12:50,476
先知预言了弥赛亚
The prophet foretold that the Messiah

190
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,779
会像羊被牵到宰杀之地
would be led like a lamb to slaughter,

191
00:12:52,781 --> 00:12:56,148
为我们的过犯受害 死在恶人身旁
pierced for our transgressions, die beside the wicked,

192
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,800
与财主同被安葬!
and be laid to rest with the rich!

193
00:12:57,801 --> 00:12:59,052
- 约翰!  - 在过去的三天里
- John!  - In the last three days,

194
00:12:59,054 --> 00:13:00,820
我亲眼看见这些事应验!
I've seen all these things!

195
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,889
但是你相信他已经死而复生了吗?
But do you believe he has risen from the dead?

196
00:13:02,891 --> 00:13:05,091
他曾保证这些都会发生
It's what he promised would happen.

197
00:13:05,093 --> 00:13:06,793
罗马皇帝的封印已经被破坏了
The emperor's seal is broken.

198
00:13:06,795 --> 00:13:10,163
我们究竟是走还是留?
Do we stay or go?

199
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,200
是罗马人!
Romans!

200
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:26,112
- 我们得走了  - 等等
- We need to leave.  - Wait.

201
00:13:34,923 --> 00:13:37,757
我们必须要冷静
We need to calm down.

202
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:42,128
我们不能排除一个可能 坟墓是被当权者打开掏空
We cannot rule out that the tomb was opened and emptied

203
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,999
好把我们逼出来然后一网打尽
by the authorities to flush us out and round us up.

204
00:13:47,001 --> 00:13:48,167
我看到他了
I saw him.

205
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:49,003
谁?
Who?

206
00:13:51,005 --> 00:13:52,000
耶稣
Jesus.

207
00:13:54,674 --> 00:13:56,442
他和我说话了
He spoke to me,

208
00:13:56,444 --> 00:13:59,379
就像我在你面前说话一样
as clearly as I'm speaking to you now.

209
00:14:12,826 --> 00:14:14,627
玛利亚...
Mary...

210
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:17,663
他还活着
He's alive.

211
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,840
他刚才站在我面前
He stood before me

212
00:14:27,842 --> 00:14:30,276
叫出了我的名字
and spoke my name.

213
00:14:39,988 --> 00:14:41,421
这会是真的吗?
Can it be true?

214
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:42,989
你怎么看 彼得?
What do you think, Peter?

215
00:14:42,991 --> 00:14:46,559
我想...
I think I feel...

216
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:52,231
他离去后我倍感痛苦
pain at his absence.

217
00:14:55,336 --> 00:14:57,536
感到无比罪恶...
Great guilt...

218
00:15:03,344 --> 00:15:07,848
因为没能陪伴他到最后
because I wasn't with him at the end.

219
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:13,719
还有羞耻!
And shame!

220
00:15:14,721 --> 00:15:19,125
我很想告诉他我对不起他
I so want to tell him I'm sorry.

221
00:15:30,538 --> 00:15:33,973
愿你们平安
Peace be with you.

222
00:15:49,256 --> 00:15:52,062
拉比!
Rabbi!

223
00:15:53,064 --> 00:15:55,030
不敢相信你亲眼所见吧
Can't you believe your own eyes,

224
00:15:57,101 --> 00:15:58,934
是否以为你们所见的是魂?
do you think you're looking at a ghost?

225
00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:03,405
魂又如何能有骨有肉呢?
What ghost carries flesh and bones?

226
00:16:13,888 --> 00:16:16,776
- 有什么吃的没有?  - 有 有
- Is there any food?  - Yes. Yes.

227
00:16:43,234 --> 00:16:45,167
这就是我从前与你们同在之时 所告诉你们的话
This is what I told you while I was with you.

228
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:47,703
摩西的律法 先知的书
Everything written about me in the laws of Moses,

229
00:16:47,705 --> 00:16:49,872
和诗篇上所记的
the prophets,

230
00:16:49,874 --> 00:16:54,875
凡指着我的话 都必须应验
and the psalms must be fulfilled.

231
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:12,428
是多马!
It's Thomas!

232
00:17:18,002 --> 00:17:20,836
拉比...
Rabbi...

233
00:17:22,139 --> 00:17:24,573
你们简直想不到我一路是怎么回来的
You won't believe the journey I've made to get back.

234
00:17:24,575 --> 00:17:26,575
我本来确信我被跟踪了
I was convinced I was being followed,

235
00:17:26,577 --> 00:17:29,044
然后我就迷糊了 也记不起来
and then I became confused and couldn't remember

236
00:17:29,046 --> 00:17:31,847
哪条街哪座房子才是对的
which was the right street or the right house.

237
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:33,482
直到我看到...
It was only when I saw...

238
00:17:35,484 --> 00:17:36,485
怎么了?
What?

239
00:17:36,487 --> 00:17:38,387
是耶稣
Jesus.

240
00:17:38,389 --> 00:17:40,689
- 我知道  - 不是
- I know.  - No.

241
00:17:40,691 --> 00:17:43,225
多马 他刚才在这
Thomas, he was here.

242
00:17:43,227 --> 00:17:44,593
什么?
What?

243
00:17:44,595 --> 00:17:47,096
耶稣刚才就在这房间里
Jesus was just here in this room.

244
00:17:47,098 --> 00:17:48,797
和我们一起分吃面包
He broke bread with us.

245
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,532
你是在和我开无聊的玩笑吗
Are you playing a sick joke on me

246
00:17:50,534 --> 00:17:52,334
就因为我最后一个回来?
because I'm the last to get back?

247
00:17:52,336 --> 00:17:53,369
不是
No.

248
00:17:53,371 --> 00:17:59,036
那么 耶稣...
So, Jesus...

249
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:01,005
刚才和你们在一起?
was here with you all?

250
00:18:01,005 --> 00:18:02,605
是的
Yes.

251
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:10,000
你们把我当成什么人 
What kind of fool do you take me for

252
00:18:10,001 --> 00:18:12,014
竟会蠢到无凭无据就相信这么一个故事?
that I would believe a story like that without proof?

253
00:18:12,016 --> 00:18:14,350
你们究竟怎么看我
What kind of opinion must you have of me

254
00:18:14,352 --> 00:18:16,452
才会相信我会这么轻易就被愚弄?
to believe I'd be so easily duped?

255
00:18:16,454 --> 00:18:19,721
- 多马 这是事实  - 够了!
- Thomas, it's the truth.  - Enough!

256
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:22,725
我两夜没合眼了
I haven't slept for two nights.

257
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,360
几乎什么都没吃
I've barely eaten.

258
00:18:24,362 --> 00:18:25,794
我拼尽全力赶回来
It was all I could do to come back at all.

259
00:18:25,796 --> 00:18:27,029
多马 我们...
Thomas, we...

260
00:18:27,031 --> 00:18:28,464
给我停下!
Stop this now!

261
00:18:28,466 --> 00:18:30,099
去墓地自己看吧
Go to the tomb and see for yourself.

262
00:18:31,102 --> 00:18:32,968
用你的亲眼见证
See with your own eyes.

263
00:18:39,043 --> 00:18:42,778
我非看见他手上的钉痕
Unless I see the nail marks in his hands,

264
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,914
用指头探入那钉痕
put my finger in them,

265
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:49,051
又用手探入他的肋旁
unless I put my hand in the spear wound itself,

266
00:18:49,053 --> 00:18:50,819
我总不信
I will not believe.

267
00:18:50,821 --> 00:18:54,490
你觉得他死了 一切都结束了?
You think he's dead and this is finished?

268
00:18:54,492 --> 00:18:56,559
还能怎样?
What else?

269
00:18:56,561 --> 00:18:58,494
还有真相
The truth.

270
00:18:58,496 --> 00:19:00,162
玛利亚...
Mary...

271
00:19:00,164 --> 00:19:01,997
去坟墓那
Go to the tomb.

272
00:19:19,817 --> 00:19:23,152
你来找我是对的
You do well to come to me.

273
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,289
不 不! 别这样! 不!
No, no, no, no! No! No, no!

274
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,892
叫你们要看守好坟墓!
You were told to guard the tomb!

275
00:19:40,605 --> 00:19:42,371
够了
Enough.

276
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:49,612
我最不能容忍的一件事就是...
One thing I cannot abide above all else...

277
00:19:49,614 --> 00:19:52,348
不忠
Disloyalty.

278
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,486
啊! 我们速战速决
Ugh! Let's do this quickly,

279
00:19:57,488 --> 00:20:00,623
要不然这臭味引来的问题可不远止老鼠那么点
before the stench attracts more questions than rats.

280
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,728
他身上有十字架刑罚留下的伤痕...
He has the wounds from the crucifixion...

281
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,963
手上 脚上 还有肋旁
Hands, the feet, and the side,

282
00:20:07,965 --> 00:20:11,133
头上有荆棘刺的伤痕 背上有
Thorn marks on the forehead and the welts from the lash

283
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:14,570
鞭打的伤口 都是新鲜的
across his back, all fresh.

284
00:20:14,572 --> 00:20:18,674
但这不是那个拿撒勒人
But this is not the Nazarene.

285
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:21,510
我说让你找那个拿撒勒人的尸体
I told you to bring me the Nazarene's body,

286
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:26,248
你却做了这么一个... 血肉模糊的遇害者尸体!
and you produce this... mutilated, murdered carcass!

287
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,517
只要你告诉民众他就是拿撒勒人
People will take him for the Nazarene

288
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,152
他们会相信的...
if you tell them it's him...

289
00:20:30,154 --> 00:20:32,588
而且只要你把尸体吊的够高
and if you hang it a good distance from the ground,

290
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,323
看起来就几乎一模一样了
the resemblance will be striking.

291
00:20:34,325 --> 00:20:37,092
在拿撒勒人的尸体没有找到的情况下
And in the event that the Nazarene's body is not found,

292
00:20:37,094 --> 00:20:38,427
这难道不是一个替代方案吗?
isn't this an alternative?

293
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:40,829
我不能冒着被指控
I cannot risk being accused of

294
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:45,567
蓄意编造骗局欺骗大众的风险
orchestrating a fraud to deceive our nation.

295
00:20:45,569 --> 00:20:49,371
可惜 民众没你想的那么蠢
Unfortunately, the people are not as stupid as you think.

296
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,874
拿走
Take it away.

297
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:53,976
简直玷污了我的圣洁
I'm made filthy by this.

298
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,953
神殿守卫在重新封印坟墓
Temple guards are resealing the tomb.

299
00:21:04,955 --> 00:21:06,756
他们为什么这么做?
Why would they do that?

300
00:21:06,758 --> 00:21:08,891
好假装他的尸体还在里面
To pretend his body remains inside,

301
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:10,173
扑灭他复活的谣言
kill any rumors that he's risen.

302
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:15,464
现在你信了吗 多马?
Now do you believe, Thomas?

303
00:21:15,466 --> 00:21:17,700
我们已经看见主了
We saw him.

304
00:21:17,702 --> 00:21:19,702
我们每个人都摸了他
Each one of us touched him,

305
00:21:19,704 --> 00:21:23,372
与他同坐 同吃 同笑
sat with him, ate with him, laughed with him.

306
00:21:23,374 --> 00:21:24,973
但我并没有
But I did not.

307
00:21:24,975 --> 00:21:27,943
怎么可能我们所有人
How can each of us be mistaken

308
00:21:27,945 --> 00:21:29,645
在完全一样的时间
in exactly the same way

309
00:21:29,647 --> 00:21:32,781
犯完全一样的错误?
at exactly the same time?

310
00:21:32,783 --> 00:21:35,684
多马...
Thomas...

311
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:03,746
我的主...
My Lord...

312
00:22:04,748 --> 00:22:08,484
你因看见了我
Now that you have seen for yourself,

313
00:22:08,486 --> 00:22:10,319
才信
you believe

314
00:22:14,091 --> 00:22:16,658
那没有看见就信的人
Blessed are they who have not seen me

315
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,495
有福了
and still believe.

316
00:22:37,088 --> 00:22:38,088
站到一边!
Stand aside!

317
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:44,628
找到他们
Find them.

318
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:48,299
彻查这里!
Tear the place apart!

319
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,979
逃犯!
Runners!

320
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:03,681
去屋顶! 快!
Roof! Go!

321
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:05,549
去楼梯! 快!
Stairs! Go!

322
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:45,322
让开!
Get out of the way!

323
00:23:58,871 --> 00:23:59,871
罗马人来了!
Romans!

324
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,427
城门口见 快走!
I'll see you at the gate. Go!

325
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:38,475
- 他们去哪里了?!  - 你为什么想知道?!
- Where will they go?!  - Why do you need to know?!

326
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,743
他们没做错任何事!
They've done nothing wrong!

327
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:41,045
你要知道 有些人
You know, some men hesitate

328
00:24:41,047 --> 00:24:43,447
在审问中打女人会下不去手
before striking a female under interrogation.

329
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:45,616
我可不是这样的人 不要跟我耍花招
I'm not one of them. Do not play games with me.

330
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:47,117
他们会去哪里?
Where will they go?

331
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,390
你儿子的尸体在哪儿?
Where is your son's body?

332
00:24:55,428 --> 00:24:57,327
不在这里
Not here.

333
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:00,397
在哪儿?
Where is it?

334
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:02,733
他母亲都不知道
If his own mother doesn't know,

335
00:25:02,735 --> 00:25:04,668
我怎么会知道?
why would I?

336
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:09,740
他们跑太快了
They had too much of a start.

337
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:14,278
封锁城市
Lock down the city.

338
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:18,382
这边
This way.

339
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,830
我在哪儿?
Where am I?

340
00:25:32,832 --> 00:25:33,964
暂时是安全的地方
Safe, for now.

341
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:35,365
你为什么要帮助我们?
Why are you helping us?

342
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,801
历史会判定究竟是你的方法还是我的
History will determine whether your path or mine

343
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:39,603
方法会将罗马人驱逐出犹太省
will drive the Romans from Judea.

344
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:41,872
另外 罗马人的敌人就是我们的朋友
In the meantime, an enemy of theirs is a friend of ours.

345
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:44,007
我让我的朋友们去城门口集合
I told my friends to make their way to the city gate

346
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:47,077
然后想办法找到一条去加利利的路
so we can find a way out to Galilee.

347
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:50,080
那里的士兵会少些
There are fewer soldiers there.

348
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:51,949
我们可以帮忙
We can help.

349
00:25:58,157 --> 00:25:59,990
靠杀人来帮忙就不用了
Not by killing.

350
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:04,328
不像这些侵占我们土地的人 我们只把死亡视作最终手段
Unlike our occupiers, we only take life as our last resort.

351
00:26:06,499 --> 00:26:10,166
我们很多祭司都因为你在拿撒勒人这件事上
There are many who are unsettled

352
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:11,969
与彼拉多交往过密感到不安
by how close you've been with Pilate over the Nazarene.

353
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:14,671
他们害怕你无法掌控这个联盟!
They fear it's an alliance you can't control!

354
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:18,208
大祭司必须保持
The high priest must maintain

355
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:21,812
一个微妙的平衡 既能够影响巡抚的决断
a delicate balance between influencing the Governor

356
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:25,048
又能够与他合力对抗我们的民众!
and joining forces with him against our people!

357
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:28,084
民众要是像我们所希望的那么温顺倒好了
If only our people were as benign as we might wish.

358
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,986
他们是不是认为我和彼拉多商量
Do they think I consulted with Pilate

359
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:34,891
处决一个疑似犹太人的同胞?
over the execution of a fellow Jew likely?

360
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:40,531
即使是现在 我还在怀疑我们做的究竟正不正确
Even now, I question whether it was the right course of action.

361
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:43,934
但我做了决定
But I made a decision.

362
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,602
他们就会看到你像个领导人一样
And they will see you standing by it

363
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:48,205
坚定守护了自己的决定
like a leader of conviction.

364
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:50,574
坚定的决心
Strong resolve

365
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:52,342
是领导的基石 神父
is the bedrock of leadership, father,

366
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:54,111
而不是简单的去满足民意
not the easy appeasement of the public will.

367
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:56,747
请不要进去! 先生
don't go in there! Sir, please!

368
00:26:56,749 --> 00:26:59,583
起先 你煽动处决无辜的传道者
First, you instigate the execution of a harmless preacher,

369
00:26:59,585 --> 00:27:01,919
接着你亵渎了我的坟墓
then you desecrate my own tomb

370
00:27:02,021 --> 00:27:03,787
又打扰了亡者!
to interfere with a corpse!

371
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:07,257
有再大的权力也不该这样行事!
By what authority do you behave like this!

372
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:09,126
没有人打扰了亡者 约瑟 
No one's interfered with the corpse, Joseph.

373
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:10,794
如果有人亵渎了你的坟墓
And if your tomb's been desecrated,

374
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:12,596
那也一定与我毫无关系
it wasn't by anyone associated with me.

375
00:27:12,598 --> 00:27:16,099
你是在用罗马的油
You've extinguished a small Jewish flame

376
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:18,869
来熄灭零星的犹太之火
by smothering it with a Roman oil.

377
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:21,671
你终究会被这火给反噬 该亚法 
You may yet get burned by this, Caiaphas.

378
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,244
天真的蠢人
Naive fool.

379
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:30,280
但却是很有影响力的蠢人
But an influential one.

380
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:35,452
任何妄图给以赛亚的预言添油加醋的
Any attempt to breathe life into Isaiah's prophecy

381
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:37,588
都得镇压
must be quashed

382
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:40,457
免得煽动起民众幻想来反抗我们!
before it ignites public imagination against us!

383
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:42,960
我正是在朝着这个方向努力
I am working on precisely that.

384
00:27:42,962 --> 00:27:46,329
那么 我能建议让你更努力一些吗?
Well, may I suggest you work on it harder?

385
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,076
站好! 顶住防线!
Stand firm! Hold the line!

386
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,128
准备好
Be ready.

387
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,863
这就送你们出去
We'll get you out.

388
00:28:23,801 --> 00:28:24,868
拿一个
Take one.

389
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,140
时机终于到了
The time has come.

390
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:31,541
打开城门!
Open the gates!

391
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,644
打开城门!
Open the gates!

392
00:28:33,646 --> 00:28:35,712
打开城门! 打开城门! 打开城门!
Open the gates! Open the gates! Open the gates!

393
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,215
打开城门! 打开城门!
Open the gates! Open the gates!

394
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,600
顶住防线!
Hold the line!

395
00:28:58,804 --> 00:29:01,004
顶住!
Hold the line!

396
00:29:09,014 --> 00:29:10,448
现在就走
Go now.

397
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:19,427
跟上!
Come on!

398
00:29:24,787 --> 00:29:26,780
你们已经搜城搜了好几天
You've been scouring the city for days.

399
00:29:26,782 --> 00:29:28,348
这伙人怎么可能就这么凭空消失?
How can a group of men simply disappear?

400
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,951
他们比我们更熟悉耶路撒冷
They know Jerusalem better than we do.

401
00:29:30,953 --> 00:29:32,619
我也许不知道他们在哪 巡抚 
I may not be able to tell you where they are, Governor,

402
00:29:32,621 --> 00:29:34,187
但我知道他们没有带着尸体逃出去
but I do know they didn't escape with the corpse.

403
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,589
他们把尸体藏起来了?
They left it at their hideout?

404
00:29:35,591 --> 00:29:37,691
我亲手把那个地方查了个底朝天
I tore the place apart with my own hands.

405
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:40,994
他们逃走的时候没带着尸体 也没尸体留在那
None had it when they ran, and it wasn't left behind.

406
00:29:42,196 --> 00:29:45,998
我恨死这个鬼地方了
How I loathe this place,

407
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,735
这么热...
its heat...

408
00:29:48,737 --> 00:29:51,505
还有热昏了头的民众
and its overheated people.

409
00:29:52,507 --> 00:29:56,175
每块石头都见证了一个奇迹
Every stone a witness to a miracle,

410
00:29:56,177 --> 00:29:57,077
每条死狗
every dead dog

411
00:29:57,079 --> 00:29:59,246
都是恶灵的凶兆
a portent of supernatural malice,

412
00:29:59,248 --> 00:30:01,948
再微小的天气突变
the slightest inconsistency in the weather

413
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:05,251
都是世界末日的前奏
a prelude to the end of the world.

414
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:11,158
我看到我现在本该在去往地中海的路上
I can see the road I should now be on to the coast,

415
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,660
克劳迪娅陪在身边
Claudia by my side,

416
00:30:13,662 --> 00:30:18,932
离开这座城市越远 她就变得越正常
becoming more her usual self with every mile from the city.

417
00:30:19,934 --> 00:30:22,936
但是我们仍然在这
But we're still here,

418
00:30:22,938 --> 00:30:27,006
该死的拿撒勒人堵住了我们的出路
that damned Nazarene blocking our exit.

419
00:30:28,008 --> 00:30:29,876
好吧 我们可是罗马人
Well, we are Rome.

420
00:30:29,878 --> 00:30:34,648
是时候由我们来结束这个故事了
It's time we shut this story down.

421
00:30:36,278 --> 00:30:40,248
加利利

422
00:31:01,343 --> 00:31:03,543
要多久才能收网?
How long till we bring in the nets?

423
00:31:04,545 --> 00:31:05,712
还早
Not yet.

424
00:31:07,014 --> 00:31:10,083
难道没有可能到现在已经有鱼
Wouldn't any fish likely to have swum into the nets

425
00:31:10,085 --> 00:31:12,419
在晚上游进网里了吗?
during the night have done so by now?

426
00:31:12,421 --> 00:31:14,154
黎明的时候鱼会更活跃
They're more active at dawn.

427
00:31:14,156 --> 00:31:15,856
黎明都过了
Dawn's over.

428
00:31:15,858 --> 00:31:17,991
我教过你如何收税吗?
Do I tell you how to collect taxes?

429
00:31:17,993 --> 00:31:19,593
没有
No.

430
00:31:19,595 --> 00:31:22,362
那就不要教我怎样捕鱼
Then don't tell me about collecting fish.

431
00:31:27,102 --> 00:31:30,203
- 你真的不觉得...  - 再说一个字 就把你踢下水
- Do you not think...  - Another word, you're going over the side.

432
00:31:30,205 --> 00:31:32,773
- 我来帮你  - 还有我
- I'll help.  - And me.

433
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,589
我不明白
I don't understand it.

434
00:31:49,591 --> 00:31:52,892
往常每年这个时候 海里到处都是鱼
The seas used to be boiling with fish this time of year.

435
00:31:52,894 --> 00:31:54,960
我们应该把捕到的那些扔回海里
We need to throw back the few that we have caught.

436
00:31:54,962 --> 00:31:56,029
也许该在我说收网的时候收起来
Perhaps if you brought the nets in when I said.

437
00:31:56,031 --> 00:31:58,865
请闭上嘴!
Please shut up!

438
00:31:59,867 --> 00:32:00,834
收获怎么样?
How's your catch?

439
00:32:01,036 --> 00:32:02,402
烂透了!
Poor!

440
00:32:02,404 --> 00:32:05,305
你们把网洒在船的右边
Cast your nets on the right-hand side.

441
00:32:05,707 --> 00:32:09,108
左边或右边 没什么分别
Left or right, it won't make any difference.

442
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:12,012
你们把网洒在船的右边
Cast them on the right-hand side.

443
00:32:16,051 --> 00:32:17,984
嚯!
Ho!

444
00:32:25,992 --> 00:32:26,659
彼得!
Peter!

445
00:32:34,969 --> 00:32:36,102
是主
It's him.

446
00:32:46,681 --> 00:32:47,514
彼得!
Peter!

447
00:33:12,806 --> 00:33:13,939
彼得...
Peter...

448
00:33:56,317 --> 00:33:59,218
当你说我会三次不认你的时候
When you told me I would deny you three times,

449
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,819
我以为那绝不可能
I thought it impossible.

450
00:34:00,821 --> 00:34:04,325
我以为你根本不了解我
I thought you don't know me at all.

451
00:34:05,827 --> 00:34:09,429
但你比我还要了解我自己
But you knew me better than I know myself.

452
00:34:12,566 --> 00:34:13,566
彼得...
Peter...

453
00:34:13,568 --> 00:34:15,435
你爱我吗?
Do you love me?

454
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,370
你知道我爱你
You know I love you.

455
00:34:18,372 --> 00:34:20,173
你喂养我的小羊
Feed my lambs.

456
00:34:23,944 --> 00:34:26,379
你真的爱我吗?
Do you truly love me?

457
00:34:27,381 --> 00:34:29,649
你知道我爱你
You know I do.

458
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:34,420
你喂养我的羊
Feed my sheep.

459
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:37,891
彼得
Peter,

460
00:34:38,893 --> 00:34:40,193
你爱我吗?
do you love me?

461
00:34:40,195 --> 00:34:42,762
我爱你
I love you.

462
00:34:46,101 --> 00:34:48,735
你跟从我吧
Then follow me.

463
00:35:02,584 --> 00:35:07,654
彼拉多的愤怒让你苦恼 你还对我视而不见
Pilate's tantrum has vexed you, and I am invisible.

464
00:35:07,656 --> 00:35:10,490
怎么回事?
What is it?

465
00:35:10,492 --> 00:35:13,126
彼拉多我能应付
Pilate I can handle.

466
00:35:13,128 --> 00:35:14,995
- 但是你的父亲  - 原来如此!
- Your father, however.  - Ah!

467
00:35:14,997 --> 00:35:17,897
他忘了我是大祭司
He forgets that I'm high priest.

468
00:35:17,899 --> 00:35:20,400
我想可能他的女儿
I think perhaps his daughter

469
00:35:20,402 --> 00:35:22,769
有时也忘记了
forgets sometimes, too.

470
00:35:25,574 --> 00:35:29,909
哦 你务必要原谅他
Oh, you must forgive him.

471
00:35:29,911 --> 00:35:32,612
他像父亲般爱着你
He loves you like a son.

472
00:35:35,484 --> 00:35:40,653
而我是像妻子般爱着你
And I love you like a wife.

473
00:35:42,024 --> 00:35:44,858
你有我和他共同的支持
You have his support and mine.

474
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:48,028
你还想奢求什么呢?
What more could you possibly want?

475
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,633
大祭司
High priest.

476
00:35:53,635 --> 00:35:56,169
怎么了?
What is it?

477
00:35:56,171 --> 00:35:58,004
是看守拿撒勒人坟墓的祭司们
The priests guarding the Nazarene's tomb.

478
00:35:58,006 --> 00:35:59,472
他们怎么了?
What of them?

479
00:35:59,474 --> 00:36:00,840
其中两位发现被人谋杀
Two of them found murdered,

480
00:36:00,842 --> 00:36:02,876
而其余的都失踪了
and the others are missing.

481
00:36:02,878 --> 00:36:04,644
谋杀?
Murdered?

482
00:36:05,677 --> 00:36:08,574
彼拉多要立刻见您
Pilate wishes to see you straight away.

483
00:36:13,567 --> 00:36:16,029
预言说我必受害
It was prophesized that I would suffer

484
00:36:16,031 --> 00:36:19,900
第三日从死里复活
and rise from the dead after three days.

485
00:36:19,902 --> 00:36:23,501
坚信吧 彼得
Believe, Peter,

486
00:36:23,503 --> 00:36:26,838
圣灵降临在你们身上
and the power of the holy spirit

487
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,707
你们就必得着能力
will come to you.

488
00:36:30,009 --> 00:36:30,710
何时?
When?

489
00:36:30,712 --> 00:36:34,413
回到耶路撒冷等待即可
Go back to Jerusalem and wait.

490
00:36:34,415 --> 00:36:35,815
只有那时你才准备好
Only then will you be ready

491
00:36:35,817 --> 00:36:37,717
去传道
to spread the word.

492
00:36:42,391 --> 00:36:45,692
为我如此 彼得
Do this for me, Peter,

493
00:36:46,694 --> 00:36:49,528
而有一天你会为我而死
and one day you will die for me.

494
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:53,833
你做好准备了吗?
Are you ready to do that?

495
00:37:01,576 --> 00:37:02,909
是的
I am.

496
00:37:24,932 --> 00:37:26,899
你们作我的见证 从耶路撒冷起
You will be my witnesses in Jerusalem

497
00:37:26,901 --> 00:37:30,903
到犹太全地和撒玛利亚
and in all Judea and Samaria

498
00:37:30,905 --> 00:37:33,606
直到地极
and to the ends of the earth.

499
00:37:33,608 --> 00:37:37,076
你们往普天下去 传福音
Go into the world and preach the gospel

500
00:37:37,078 --> 00:37:39,079
给万民听
to all creation.

501
00:38:28,196 --> 00:38:33,033
这一切即将结束
This will all soon be over.

502
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,939
巡抚
Governor.

503
00:38:39,941 --> 00:38:43,943
罗马帝国的兴盛 该亚法
The Roman Empire prospers, Caiaphas,

504
00:38:43,945 --> 00:38:48,648
不是因为其压榨民众之少
not because it consumes lesser civilizations,

505
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:50,517
而是因为它包容民众
but because it embraces

506
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:53,453
并于他们构成一种合作关系
and forms partnerships with them.

507
00:38:53,455 --> 00:38:57,057
从最高层次上说 这只有互相信任
At the highest level, this can only happen in a spirit

508
00:38:57,059 --> 00:38:59,792
- 才能实现  - 我理解
- of mutual trust.  - I understand that.

509
00:38:59,794 --> 00:39:01,161
是吗?
Do you?

510
00:39:01,163 --> 00:39:04,029
把守卫们带过来
Bring in the guards.

511
00:39:04,031 --> 00:39:05,899
守卫?
Guards?

512
00:39:06,201 --> 00:39:11,737
那些你坚持要我安排在拿撒勒人墓地的守卫
Roman guards you insisted I place upon the Nazarene's tomb

513
00:39:11,739 --> 00:39:13,840
那些我发现
and guards who I have discovered

514
00:39:13,842 --> 00:39:16,643
在半夜离职弃岗的守卫
abandoned their post in the middle of the night.

515
00:39:21,316 --> 00:39:23,483
一次又一次地
Time and again,

516
00:39:23,485 --> 00:39:25,818
我相信你能
I entrusted you to bring

517
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,353
处理好这桩烂摊子
this sorry business to a close,

518
00:39:27,355 --> 00:39:28,988
该亚法
Caiaphas.

519
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:32,025
而一次又一次地 你让我失望
Time and again, you've failed to do so,

520
00:39:32,027 --> 00:39:33,059
所以现在必须由我出面
so now I must.

521
00:39:33,061 --> 00:39:34,727
你害我的祭司被杀...
You had my priests killed...

522
00:39:34,729 --> 00:39:35,729
不许插嘴!
I'm speaking!

523
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:39,131
你应该把这当成
You should consider this

524
00:39:39,133 --> 00:39:41,567
市政管理的一课
a lesson in civic administration.

525
00:39:41,569 --> 00:39:45,038
如果你控制不了谣言...
If you cannot control a story...

526
00:39:46,108 --> 00:39:48,007
就杀死它
kill it.

527
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:10,096
巡抚 求你
Governor, please.

528
00:40:10,098 --> 00:40:11,598
我怀着诚实和忠诚来找您
I come to you in good faith and loyalty,

529
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,234
因为我的荣誉感不允许我
'cause my honor wouldn't allow me

530
00:40:14,236 --> 00:40:17,404
和其他人一样逃走躲起来
to run and hide with the others.

531
00:40:21,809 --> 00:40:22,909
我明白...
I understand...

532
00:40:22,911 --> 00:40:26,211
也很高兴
and I am glad of it.

533
00:40:26,982 --> 00:40:29,481
谢谢您 巡抚
Thank you, Governor.

534
00:40:36,057 --> 00:40:40,460
但是你 也是那晚的目击者
But you, too, were a witness that night.

535
00:40:43,465 --> 00:40:45,765
而你来找我
And you came to me

536
00:40:45,767 --> 00:40:48,334
不是出于诚实和忠心
not out of good faith and loyalty,

537
00:40:48,336 --> 00:40:50,570
而是为了救你自己的狗命
but to save your own skin

538
00:40:50,572 --> 00:40:53,672
而出卖你的同伴们...
at the expense of your comrades...

539
00:40:53,674 --> 00:40:55,107
他们是好人...
Good men...

540
00:40:55,109 --> 00:40:56,842
本不该死
who really didn't deserve to die,

541
00:40:56,844 --> 00:41:01,347
不像你这该死的胆小狗
unlike a cowardly dog who does.

542
00:41:07,955 --> 00:41:09,087
终于...
Finally...

543
00:41:09,089 --> 00:41:11,324
重生的预言
the prophecy of the resurrection

544
00:41:11,326 --> 00:41:14,126
和这些人一样消逝了
lies as dead as these men.

545
00:41:14,128 --> 00:41:15,995
让那个拿撒勒人的信徒
Let the Nazarene's followers

546
00:41:15,997 --> 00:41:19,098
尽管带着他腐烂的尸体逃亡吧
run where they like with his rotting corpse.

547
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:23,335
他们一旦露面 就会被抓住处死的
They won't surface without being caught and executed.

548
00:41:27,976 --> 00:41:29,976
我的妻子还在等我
My wife is waiting for me,

549
00:41:29,978 --> 00:41:34,880
我们俩还等着去海边
and the coast is waiting for us both.

550
00:41:36,333 --> 00:41:37,653
把这收拾干净
Clean this up.

551
00:41:43,733 --> 00:41:44,953
下集预告...
Next Sunday...

552
00:41:44,963 --> 00:41:46,653
施舍几块钱吧 大人
A few coins, master.

553
00:41:47,533 --> 00:41:48,653
站起来
Rise up.

554
00:41:50,233 --> 00:41:53,453
因为耶稣 这个人又能走路了
It's for Jesus, this man walks again.

555
00:41:53,733 --> 00:41:55,953
随着这位父亲越发相信上帝
As the father's belief grew stronger,

556
00:41:55,983 --> 00:41:58,853
他对抗帝国的决心也日益坚定
so does his will to defy the Empire.

557
00:41:58,853 --> 00:42:00,300
我从彼此身上汲取力量
We draw strength from each other.

558
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:01,853
为他传道
Spread his word.

559
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:05,653
终结这个流言 永绝后患
Shot this story down, once and for all.

560
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:07,653
他们会杀掉你吗?
Will they kill you?

561
00:42:08,833 --> 00:42:09,853
我不知道
I don't know.
