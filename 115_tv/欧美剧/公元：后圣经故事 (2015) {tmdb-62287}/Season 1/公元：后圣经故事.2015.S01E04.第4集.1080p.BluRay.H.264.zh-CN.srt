约翰... 我们可能永远出不去了
John... We may never leave here.

8
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:22,164
彼拉多明天打算亲自造访神庙

9
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,267
波阿斯 这就是先知们所说的可憎之事
Boaz, this is the abomination the prophets talked about.

10
00:00:25,302 --> 00:00:26,636
那我们下手的时间就到了
Then our time has come.

11
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:29,605
哥尼流!
Cornelius!

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,080
但愿你死得其所

你们造下的孽
Others will pay the price

32

会有别人来付出代价
for the things that you've done.

33
00:01:19,923 --> 00:01:22,558
只要一个名字 你就能让他们免于受苦
A single name from you could spare them.

34
00:01:27,898 --> 00:01:30,031
难道这不就是你想要的?

35
00:01:30,066 --> 00:01:31,200
生杀大权?
Power?

42
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,269
但在神殿处决三个犹太人实在不是...
but the killing of three Jews at the temple is not...

43
00:02:07,237 --> 00:02:09,038
打开它
Open it.

44
00:02:09,072 --> 00:02:12,441
这是什么?

被谋害的那位罗马军官

那个杀手是冲我来的
The assassin came for me.

48
00:02:24,488 --> 00:02:28,758
这种事不会再有第二次
There will be no repeat offense.

49
00:02:28,792 --> 00:02:36,165
鉴于我们没抓到杀手本人
And seeing as we do not have the assassin himself,

50
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:40,903
十个犹太人会替他接受惩罚
10 Jews will be punished in his place.

51
00:02:40,938 --> 00:02:43,139
惩罚?
Punished?

52
00:02:43,173 --> 00:02:45,741
钉上十字架
Crucified.

53
00:02:45,776 --> 00:02:50,880
今日
Today.

54
00:02:50,914 --> 00:02:54,450
巡抚 我... 我...
Governor, I... I'm...

55
00:02:54,484 --> 00:02:58,120
能用其它方式予以补偿吗?
Is there not some other form of reparation?

56
00:02:58,155 --> 00:03:02,058
明日也如此
And tomorrow.

57
00:03:02,092 --> 00:03:03,860

00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,862
持续多少日?
How many days?

每天钉死十个犹太人
10 Jews will be crucified every day

00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:20,443
直到我抓到那个想杀我的人为止

61
00:03:23,547 --> 00:03:25,915
快点... 往前走
Come on... move it.

62
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:28,584
快点... 动起来!
Come on... move!

63

他们究竟犯了什么错?
What have they done?

65
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:36,759
你们在保护一个杀人犯
You're shielding a murderer.

66
00:03:36,793 --> 00:03:40,996
只要他未落网 就一天杀十个人
10 will die each day that he evades justice.

67
00:03:46,403 --> 00:03:49,305
我们应该把审判耶稣的信徒
We should delay the trial of Jesus' followers

68
00:03:49,339 --> 00:03:52,974
推迟到袭击彼拉多的杀手被抓到之后
until Pilate's assassin has been caught.

69
00:03:53,009 --> 00:03:56,344
不行 亚那 神殿现在应该表现强硬
No, Annas. The temple has to be seen to be strong now.

70
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:58,314
我们需要速速审判他们好终止混乱的局面
We need a quick trial to end their disruption.

71
00:03:58,348 --> 00:04:00,549
让我去对付那个瘸子乞丐
Leave the crippled beggar to me.

72
00:04:00,584 --> 00:04:03,319
我会处理好的
I will deal with it.

73

那个杀手有消息了吗 流便?
What news of the assassin, Reuben?

74
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:06,589
我找遍了所有人...
I've been to everyone...

75
00:04:06,623 --> 00:04:09,392
反动分子 煽动分子 走私犯 甚至土匪
Reactionaries, agitators, smugglers, even bandits.

76
00:04:09,426 --> 00:04:10,793
没人知道是谁干的
No one knows who did it.

77
00:04:15,098 --> 00:04:17,033
再去查
Go again.

78
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:19,568
施加更大压力
Press harder.

79
00:04:38,955 --> 00:04:40,692
就这样...
So...

80
00:04:42,726 --> 00:04:46,062
开始了
it's begun.

81
00:04:51,668 --> 00:04:54,070
你是否悔改你的罪?
Do you repent your sins?

82

我悔改
I do.

83
00:04:55,606 --> 00:04:58,474
你是否信耶稣基督 神的儿子?
Do you believe in Jesus Christ, the son of God,

84
00:04:58,508 --> 00:05:02,278
他被钉在十字架上杀了 又在第三日复活
who died on the cross and rose again on the third day?

85
00:05:02,312 --> 00:05:03,713
我信
I do.

86
00:05:03,747 --> 00:05:05,514
我奉圣父 圣子 
Then in the name of the father and of the son

87
00:05:05,549 --> 00:05:08,251
圣灵的名 为你施洗
and of the Holy Spirit, I baptize you.

88
00:05:24,801 --> 00:05:27,241
回到城里去 等我们来传道
Go back to the city and wait for word from us.

89
00:05:27,271 --> 00:05:30,039
我们会在夜晚来临前为你找到居所
We'll find you a place to stay before night falls.

90
00:05:30,073 --> 00:05:31,507
我也要去耶路撒冷
I'm going to Jerusalem, too.

91
00:05:31,542 --> 00:05:32,875
什么?
What?

92
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:34,544
我要知道我父亲究竟发生了什么事
I need to know what's happening to my father.

93
00:05:34,578 --> 00:05:36,946
玛雅 你为何不同她一起去呢?
Mary, why don't you go with her?

94
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,147
我们会负责这里
We'll manage here.

95
00:05:39,182 --> 00:05:41,984

I've heard lots about him.

97
00:05:46,924 --> 00:05:47,924
我叫司提反
I'm Stephen.

98
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,927
我是玛雅

99
00:05:57,234 --> 00:05:59,702
我能和你们一起去吗?
Can I join you?

100
00:05:59,736 --> 00:06:06,309
我们为受痛之人祈祷 也为施痛之人祈祷

我们祈祷拥有力量 即便在恐惧与哀痛之时
We pay for the strength to resist the urge to inhumanity

102
00:06:11,415 --> 00:06:14,617
也可克制不仁的冲动

103
00:06:14,651 --> 00:06:18,588
我们祈祷拥有勇气 即便旁人需索
We pray for the courage to resist the calls to inhumanity

104
00:06:18,622 --> 00:06:20,723
也可克制不仁的求告
that others may make upon us.

105
00:06:20,757 --> 00:06:24,994
愿我们摆脱伤痛与恐惧
May we find relief from our hurt and fear.

106
00:06:25,028 --> 00:06:27,563
愿我们即使深受苦痛
And may we not, in our pain,

107
00:06:27,598 --> 00:06:32,068
仍能对他人之伤痛与恐惧保有同情
lose our empathy for the hurt and fear of others.

108
00:06:32,102 --> 00:06:37,073
我们为受痛之人祈祷 也为施痛之人祈祷
We pray for all who are in pain and all who cause pain.

109
00:06:52,589 --> 00:06:54,423
爸爸
Papa.

110
00:07:00,998 --> 00:07:04,901
他的名字 还有他的藏身地点
His name and where to find him.

111
00:07:07,538 --> 00:07:12,141
没事的
It's all right.

112
00:07:12,175 --> 00:07:14,544
不要哭
Don't cry.

113
00:07:14,578 --> 00:07:16,846
好孩子
Big girl.

114
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:22,051
放她走
Let her go.

115
00:07:24,221 --> 00:07:29,025
然后... 我就告诉你
Then... I'll tell you.

116
00:07:51,882 --> 00:07:55,418
约翰 我们要死在今天了

前进!
Forward!

118
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,971
长官
Sir.

119
00:08:43,352 --> 00:08:45,853
杀手的名字是波阿斯
The assassin's name is Boaz.

120
00:08:45,888 --> 00:08:47,288
但他逃走了
But he has fled.

121
00:08:47,322 --> 00:08:50,258
哥尼流 你让我失望了
You disappoint me, Cornelius.

122
00:08:50,292 --> 00:08:52,126
计划继续进行
Continue as before.

123
00:08:52,161 --> 00:08:55,062
你可以退下了
You may go.

124
00:08:55,097 --> 00:08:59,000
波阿斯是犹太人
Boaz is a Jew.

125
00:08:59,034 --> 00:09:00,802
你应该把这个名字告诉该亚法
You should give his name to Caiaphas.

126
00:09:00,836 --> 00:09:04,138
他的人由他来找会更合适
He's better placed to find one of his own.

127
00:09:04,173 --> 00:09:07,942
你建议我向该亚法低声下气?
You suggest that I humble myself before Caiaphas?

128
00:09:07,976 --> 00:09:15,716
克劳迪娅 罗马从不向下属求助
Rome does not beg favors of its subjects, Claudia.

129
00:09:33,135 --> 00:09:36,437
梅莱克?
Melek?

130
00:09:36,472 --> 00:09:38,506
站起来
Stand up.

131
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,578
拿撒勒人给了你多少钱
How much did the Nazarenes pay you

132
00:09:43,612 --> 00:09:45,046
让你假装被治愈?
to pretend you were healed?

133
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,914
没人给我一分钱
No one paid me anything.

134
00:09:48,951 --> 00:09:54,322
彼得这个人 打算毁掉神庙
This man Peter intends to destroy the temple.

135
00:09:57,626 --> 00:09:59,794
帮我们阻止他
Help us to prevent that.

136
00:10:20,582 --> 00:10:22,550
这麻烦交给你们了
Your problem now.

137
00:10:51,747 --> 00:10:55,183
彼得 告诉我
Tell me, Peter.

138
00:10:55,217 --> 00:10:59,120
彼得
Peter.

139
00:10:59,154 --> 00:11:01,189
你父亲本来给你起名叫西门 对吗?
Your father named you Simon, did he not?

140
00:11:01,223 --> 00:11:02,223
是的
He did.

141
00:11:02,257 --> 00:11:03,825
但你叫"彼得"
And yet "Peter".

142
00:11:03,859 --> 00:11:06,227
谁给你的这个名字?
Who gave you this name?

143
00:11:08,797 --> 00:11:11,866
拿撒勒人耶稣基督
Jesus Christ of Nazareth.

144
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,044
彼得 难道你不尊重你的父亲吗?
Don't you honor your father, Peter?

145
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:24,379
我尊重他
I do.

146
00:11:24,413 --> 00:11:25,973
但是明显比不上一个因为亵渎神明
But apparently less than you honor a man

147
00:11:25,981 --> 00:11:28,750
煽动叛乱而被处死之人
put to death for blasphemy and sedition.

148
00:11:28,784 --> 00:11:32,854
彼得是个绰号 是种爱称 
Peter is a nickname, a term of endearment.

149
00:11:32,888 --> 00:11:36,924
意思不过是"我的磐石"
It simply means "my rock."

150
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,801
你们看 岩石可以用来建造...
You see, a rock can be something to build with...

151
00:11:46,835 --> 00:11:49,237
比如说一座新的神庙
a new temple, for instance.

152
00:11:49,271 --> 00:11:51,739
或者被用作武器
or it can be a weapon.

153
00:11:51,774 --> 00:11:53,775
投石器中的石块
A rock in a sling.

154
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:57,145
问题是 你是哪一种?
The question is, which are you?

155
00:12:05,587 --> 00:12:10,658
告诉我们 你们奉谁的名声称治愈了那个跛脚的人?
Tell us, in whose name do you claim the cripple was healed?

156
00:12:11,692 --> 00:12:14,695
你们众人
Let it be known to all of you

157
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,831
和以色列百姓都当知道
and to all of the people of Israel

158
00:12:16,865 --> 00:12:18,132
他得痊愈
that he was healed

159
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:23,104
是因你们所钉十字架的
by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,

160
00:12:23,138 --> 00:12:24,605
拿撒勒人耶稣基督的名!
whom you crucified!

161
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,308
你是说拿撒勒人本人治好了他
Do you say the Nazarene himself healed him,

162
00:12:27,342 --> 00:12:28,843
而不是神?
not God?

163
00:12:28,877 --> 00:12:34,682
我说他得痊愈 因神以耶稣基督的名
I say he was healed by God in the name of Jesus Christ,

164
00:12:34,717 --> 00:12:38,386
也即神叫他从死里复活的那人!
whom God resurrected from death!

165
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:42,824
你这个骗子!
You're liars!

166
00:12:42,858 --> 00:12:46,994
没有治愈 只有欺骗
There was no healing, only deception.

167
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:50,798
我们知道这个... 所谓的奇迹
We know that this... this miracle

168
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:53,868
不过是一出戏院里
was nothing more than theater

169
00:12:53,902 --> 00:12:56,804
演员们的把戏
with actors playing roles

170
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:02,744
好粉饰他们那个死去的拿撒勒人
to falsely glorify their dead Nazarene.

171
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,418
你是梅莱克 那个乞丐
You're the beggar known as Melek.

172
00:13:31,325 --> 00:13:32,195
我是...
I am...

173
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:35,185
你自儿时便来神庙乞讨
And you beg to the temple since childhood,

174
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:38,057
那时就是瘸了的样子 对吗?
presenting yourself as lame, yes?

175
00:13:38,726 --> 00:13:39,727
是的
Yes.

176
00:13:40,516 --> 00:13:42,380
然而今天 在神面前
Yet today, in sight of God,

177
00:13:42,724 --> 00:13:44,558
我们清楚地看到你腿脚很好
we clearly see you're quite well.

178
00:13:46,795 --> 00:13:48,729
因为他从没瘸过
Because he was never lame.

179
00:13:48,764 --> 00:13:53,667
他只是发现如果装成残疾的孩子
He'd simply found that appearing to be a sickly child

180
00:13:53,702 --> 00:13:59,673
会更容易撬开路人的钱包 对吗?
was a more effective lever into a stranger's purse, yes?

181
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,943
实话实说 在神的眼下
Truthfully, under the eyes of God,

182
00:14:02,957 --> 00:14:06,113
你是否承认这些人跟你合谋
do you admit these men conspired with you

183
00:14:06,148 --> 00:14:08,749
制造出了被治愈的假象
to create the illusion of healing,

184
00:14:08,784 --> 00:14:13,354
装出了他们所谓的奇迹?
a pretense which they claimed to be a miracle?

185
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,194
我是个穷人
I am a poor man.

186
00:14:20,228 --> 00:14:23,164
我的一生都在这里乞讨
My whole life has been spent begging here.

187
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:25,666
我受过神庙的恩惠
And I'm beholden to this temple.

188
00:14:25,701 --> 00:14:31,072
在神的眼下 我愿意说出实话
Under the eyes of God, I will tell the truth.

189
00:14:41,249 --> 00:14:45,052
我生来双腿残疾
I was born lame.

190
00:14:47,222 --> 00:14:50,891
一生中从没走过一步路
I never walked a step in my life.

191
00:14:50,926 --> 00:14:54,729
没有把戏 没有欺骗
There was no trickery, no deception.

192
00:14:54,763 --> 00:14:59,667
为了彼得 我赞美神
I praise God for this man, Peter,

193
00:14:59,701 --> 00:15:03,037
赞美他们称为拿撒勒人耶稣的那个人
and the one they call Jesus of Nazareth.

194
00:15:03,071 --> 00:15:05,506
我赞美神将我治愈
I praise God for healing me.

195
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,274
- 他们是无辜的 把他们放了  - 放了他们!
- They're innocent. Just release them.  - Free them!

196
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,511
放他们走!
Let them go!

197
00:15:10,545 --> 00:15:11,846
放了他们!
Free them!

198
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,781
那么 那个跛子确实被治愈了
So, the cripple was healed.

199
00:15:13,815 --> 00:15:15,850
该亚法 你现在是形势所迫
Caiaphas, your hand is forced.

200
00:15:29,164 --> 00:15:30,398
你们将会被释放
You are to be released.

201
00:15:34,102 --> 00:15:37,004
但是有前提条件的
But it is on the condition

202
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:41,542
你们不可奉拿撒勒人耶稣的名
that you do not speak or teach the name

203
00:15:41,576 --> 00:15:43,911
讲论 教训人
of Jesus of Nazareth.

204
00:15:46,982 --> 00:15:49,383
毁掉这个条件...
Break this condition...

205
00:15:49,418 --> 00:15:52,486
那么反过来 我们就毁掉你们
and you, in turn, will be broken.

206
00:15:52,521 --> 00:15:54,422
你已经审判了我们
You've judged us.

207
00:15:54,456 --> 00:15:59,293
现在你们自己酌量吧 听从你们
Now you must judge, if in God's eyes,

208
00:15:59,328 --> 00:16:04,999
不听从神 这在神面前合理不合理
it's right that we obey you rather than him.

209
00:16:05,033 --> 00:16:10,438
趁我没改主意 赶紧从我眼前消失
Get out of my sight before I change my mind.

210
00:16:29,124 --> 00:16:30,825
兄弟
Brother.

211
00:16:44,172 --> 00:16:47,141
这么多人... 发生什么事了?
All these people... what happened?

212
00:16:47,175 --> 00:16:50,845
都是你的功劳 而且还会有更多人来
You did. And they just keep coming.

213
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:52,012
西门
Simon.

214
00:16:53,115 --> 00:16:54,815
你当时是准备要死了吗?
Were you prepared to die?

215
00:16:56,485 --> 00:16:58,152
是的
Yes.

216
00:16:58,186 --> 00:17:02,857
如果能有如此结果 那我愿再做一次
And if this is the result, I'm prepared to do it again.

217
00:17:06,428 --> 00:17:09,997
朋友们 当初我离开之时
My friends, when I left here,

218
00:17:10,032 --> 00:17:13,032
我们只有屈指可数的几个人而已...
there was little more than a handful of us...

219
00:17:13,502 --> 00:17:14,869
东躲西藏
hiding.

220
00:17:16,104 --> 00:17:18,372
担惊受怕
Timid.

221
00:17:18,407 --> 00:17:20,007
焦急等待
Waiting.

222
00:17:20,042 --> 00:17:25,946
但我今日回来 看到我们已经不计其数!
But now I return to find we are already beyond counting!

223
00:17:29,251 --> 00:17:31,452
我们因信仰找到了彼此
We have found each other in faith,

224
00:17:31,486 --> 00:17:34,055
我们必须以此为耀
and now we must honor that.

225
00:17:34,089 --> 00:17:35,723
我们必须互相扶持
We must provide for each other

226
00:17:35,757 --> 00:17:37,825
因为我们彼此互相汲取着力量
as we draw strength from each other.

227
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:39,393
你身边的人能够站稳
The man beside you stands

228
00:17:39,428 --> 00:17:41,762
是因为有你的支持
because you are there to hold him up.

229
00:17:41,797 --> 00:17:46,767
只要我们每个人都付出所有的 只索取需要的
We are united when each of us gives what we have

230
00:17:46,802 --> 00:17:48,969
我们就是同心一体的
and takes only what we need.

231
00:17:49,004 --> 00:17:54,809
神的国将要来临 而我们会有资格进入!
The kingdom of God is coming, and we will be fit to enter!

232
00:18:03,618 --> 00:18:04,985
我的捐项
My offering.

233
00:18:07,055 --> 00:18:09,023
有些人都给不了什么
Some have so little to give.

234
00:18:09,057 --> 00:18:11,292
但他们愿倾其所有
But they give all they have,

235
00:18:11,326 --> 00:18:13,594
那他们就是我们最大的恩主
and they're our greatest benefactors.

236
00:18:13,629 --> 00:18:16,897
你确定吗? 你真的愿意把所有的都献出来?
Are you sure? Are you certain you want to give everything?

237
00:18:16,932 --> 00:18:18,932
已经说好的
Well, that's the deal.

238
00:18:18,966 --> 00:18:21,134
如果他们说的是真的
And if what they say is true,

239
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:22,970
神的国将要来临...
that the kingdom of God is coming...

240
00:18:22,984 --> 00:18:25,105
是的 如果... 如果是真的
Yes, if... if it's true.

241
00:18:25,139 --> 00:18:27,375
但如果属实 难道你不想成为其中一员
But if it's true, don't you want to be part of it

242
00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:30,878
远离外界的一切朽坏与暴虐吗?
and away from all the corruption and misery out there?

243
00:18:30,912 --> 00:18:32,380
原谅我 我是想相信
Forgive me. I want to believe.

244
00:18:32,414 --> 00:18:33,714
真的想
I truly do.

245
00:18:33,749 --> 00:18:36,684
我只是觉得我们应该谨慎些
I just think we should try to be cautious.

246
00:18:36,718 --> 00:18:37,985
没错
Yes.

247
00:18:42,924 --> 00:18:49,030
我们卖掉旧房子好在这里安个新家
We sold our old home for a new home here.

248
00:18:49,064 --> 00:18:52,567
我们在世上所有的一切...
All that we have in the world...

249
00:18:56,271 --> 00:19:00,174
我们都给他
we give to him.

250
00:19:14,056 --> 00:19:15,790
- 你是彼得吗?  - 是的
- Are you Peter?  - I am.

251
00:19:15,824 --> 00:19:16,891
请跟我来
Please, come.

252
00:19:20,729 --> 00:19:22,830
我的女儿病了 
My daughter's sick.

253
00:19:22,864 --> 00:19:27,468
如果你愿意 请把她带回来
If you're willing, bring her back, please.

254
00:19:27,502 --> 00:19:32,273
那将是神的旨意... 不是我的
It'll be God's will... not mine.

255
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:53,995
奉...
In the name...

256
00:19:54,029 --> 00:19:58,766
奉耶稣基督的名 痊愈吧
In the name of Jesus Christ, be healed.

257
00:20:07,075 --> 00:20:10,611
孩子 听我说
Child, hear me.

258
00:20:10,646 --> 00:20:18,619
我与他同行 同吃 称他为我的朋友
I walked with him, ate with him, called him my friend.

259
00:20:18,654 --> 00:20:25,292
奉耶稣基督的名 痊愈吧
In the name of Jesus Christ, be healed.

260
00:20:33,435 --> 00:20:36,437
哦 谢谢你
Oh, thank you.

261
00:20:49,694 --> 00:20:50,961
彼得 那真是...
Peter, that was...

262
00:20:50,995 --> 00:20:53,229
我是说 我们得告诉大家这件事
I mean, we need to tell people about this.

263
00:20:53,263 --> 00:20:53,997
我们应该到神殿去
We should go to the temple.

264
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,465
不 我们还不能去神殿传福音
No. We're not preaching in the temple yet.

265
00:20:55,499 --> 00:20:56,933
但现在神与你同在
But God is with you right now.

266
00:20:56,968 --> 00:20:58,034
我们得给大祭司看到这一切
We need to show the high priests.

267
00:20:58,069 --> 00:20:59,569
我说了不行
I said no.

268
00:21:01,606 --> 00:21:03,039
耐心点 司提反
Be patient, Stephen.

269
00:21:03,074 --> 00:21:05,208
时机会到的
The time will come.

270
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,721
这些年轻人做了什么?
What have these young men done?

271
00:21:17,755 --> 00:21:18,889
闪开 孩子
Move aside, boy.

272
00:21:18,923 --> 00:21:20,323
这是巡抚的事
This is the Governor's business.

273
00:21:20,358 --> 00:21:24,494
我问你他们做了什么要受此惩罚
I ask what they've done to deserve this.

274
00:21:24,529 --> 00:21:25,929
闪开
Move aside.

275
00:21:27,665 --> 00:21:28,899
不
No.

276
00:21:42,013 --> 00:21:43,780
别逼我割了你的喉咙
Don't make me cut your throat.

277
00:21:43,815 --> 00:21:45,282
我想留你一条小命
I want you to live.

278
00:21:45,316 --> 00:21:46,683
为什么?
Why?

279
00:21:47,718 --> 00:21:51,087
因为我宽宏大量
Because I am merciful.

280
00:21:59,964 --> 00:22:01,932
都散开
Move along.

281
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,868
让出路来!
Clear the way there!

282
00:22:04,902 --> 00:22:08,205
彼得
Peter.

283
00:22:13,811 --> 00:22:18,048
告诉我你有什么困扰
Tell me what's troubling you.

284
00:22:18,082 --> 00:22:23,587
一切都变化得太快了
Everything's changing so quickly.

285
00:22:23,621 --> 00:22:27,857
你早知这条路不好走
You knew this wasn't going to be easy.

286
00:22:27,892 --> 00:22:32,462
坏事将会发生...
Bad things are gonna happen...

287
00:22:32,496 --> 00:22:33,730
在我身上...
to me...

288
00:22:33,765 --> 00:22:37,400
在大家身上
The others.

289
00:22:37,435 --> 00:22:40,437
可怕的事情
Terrible things.

290
00:22:40,471 --> 00:22:43,974
我儿子选择你是有原因的
My son chose you for a reason.

291
00:22:44,008 --> 00:22:48,111
他知道你的信仰足够强大
He knew your faith was strong enough

292
00:22:48,146 --> 00:22:51,414
可以担当重任
to bear the responsibility,

293
00:22:51,449 --> 00:22:55,852
可以帮你成为大家需要的人
to help you to become the man our people need you to be.

294
00:23:12,403 --> 00:23:13,703
把他们带过来
Get them up there.

295
00:23:13,738 --> 00:23:15,338
- 快点  - 是 长官
- Move it.  - Yes, sir.

296
00:23:43,601 --> 00:23:44,734
彼拉多
Pilate.

297
00:23:48,072 --> 00:23:51,308
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

298
00:23:51,342 --> 00:23:53,610
你见过马库斯·德鲁苏斯吗?
Did you ever meet Marcus Drusus?

299
00:23:53,644 --> 00:23:56,213
这就是他
Here he is.

300
00:23:56,247 --> 00:23:58,415
被人杀害
Murdered.

301
00:24:01,452 --> 00:24:03,220
要知道他们是冲我来的
They came for me, you know.

302
00:24:07,358 --> 00:24:14,030
但现在我要用他们的骨灰堆积成山
But now I'm building a mountain of their ashes.

303
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:31,281
要是我能找得到你 他们也会的
If I've found you, they will find you.

304
00:24:31,315 --> 00:24:33,283
但他们下手不会像我这么干脆利落
But they won't kill you quickly, like I would.

305
00:24:33,317 --> 00:24:35,118
我不会招供的 利未 我发誓
I wouldn't tell them anything, Levi, I swear it.

306
00:24:35,153 --> 00:24:36,753
但我不想冒这个风险
But I don't want that to be put to the test.

307
00:24:36,788 --> 00:24:38,088
你若当真想杀我
If you were going to kill me,

308
00:24:38,122 --> 00:24:39,389
之前在街上就下手了
you would have done it in the street.

309
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,657
为何没有?
So why not?

310
00:24:45,563 --> 00:24:48,398
因为你杀了一个罗马人
Because you took a Roman life.

311
00:24:48,432 --> 00:24:51,535
只要他们杀不了你
As long as they don't take yours,

312
00:24:51,569 --> 00:24:54,037
你就能鼓舞众人
you're an inspiration.

313
00:24:54,071 --> 00:24:55,439
你做得到 别人也做得到
If one can do it, so can others.

314
00:24:55,473 --> 00:24:57,207
那你有何建议?
And what do you propose?

315
00:24:57,241 --> 00:25:00,811
你就此销声匿迹
That you disappear.

316
00:26:27,899 --> 00:26:30,434
你非等闲之辈 约翰
You're a very unusual man, John.

317
00:26:30,468 --> 00:26:31,968
你认识我?
You know me?

318
00:26:32,003 --> 00:26:33,470
我目睹了你的审判
I saw your trial.

319
00:26:33,504 --> 00:26:36,072
就眼下而言 大多数人
Now, these days, most people,

320
00:26:36,107 --> 00:26:39,910
因害怕钉十字架而低调行事
they keep a low profile for fear of crucifixion,

321
00:26:39,944 --> 00:26:40,977
而你却...
and yet you...

322
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:45,482
我做了个梦
I had a vision.

323
00:26:45,516 --> 00:26:50,454
它指引我来到这块开裂的石砖前
And it bids me to be here on this cracked stone.

324
00:26:50,488 --> 00:26:53,390
这个...
Well...

325
00:26:53,424 --> 00:26:55,025
听听没坏处
For what it's worth, um,

326
00:26:55,059 --> 00:26:58,128
我不建议你现在就在这传福音
I would encourage against preaching here just yet.

327
00:27:01,132 --> 00:27:03,600
我看得出你是个富贵之人
I see you're a man who's prospered.

328
00:27:03,634 --> 00:27:06,036
如果我们保持沉默 你觉得满意吗?
Does it suit you if we stay quiet?

329
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:09,439
你臆断贵贱有别 真让我失望
I'm disappointed you assume my wealth sets us apart.

330
00:27:09,474 --> 00:27:11,441
我很乐意倾尽所有
I would gladly exchange my last penny

331
00:27:11,476 --> 00:27:14,411
来让你在这祭坛前向世人布道
to hear your message preached to the world from this altar.

332
00:27:14,445 --> 00:27:16,613
- 那你为何没有?  - 只因为你没要求
- Then why don't you?  - You haven't asked.

333
00:27:18,516 --> 00:27:22,786
你们把自己局限在贫苦之人中
You confine yourselves to the poor and sick.

334
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:26,623
而我有着同样贫苦的...
I'm poor and sick...

335
00:27:26,657 --> 00:27:27,991
灵魂
in my soul.

336
00:27:28,025 --> 00:27:31,228
我穷尽一生收集财富
I spent my life collecting wealth

337
00:27:31,262 --> 00:27:34,831
到头来却被其占据一切
only to find it's taken my place.

338
00:27:34,866 --> 00:27:38,335
只留下空虚的皮囊
The man is meaningless.

339
00:27:38,369 --> 00:27:42,139
那就随我来吧... 就现在
Then come with me... now.

340
00:27:42,173 --> 00:27:44,608
奉耶稣基督的名加入我们
Join us in the name of Jesus Christ,

341
00:27:44,642 --> 00:27:47,411
你的内心就会富足起来
and the man will be fulfilled.

342
00:27:47,445 --> 00:27:50,213
那你的梦呢?
What about your vision?

343
00:27:56,934 --> 00:28:00,092
我相信是他引导我到这里找到你
I believe he led me here to find you.

344
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,905
当初同我来这的男人
The man I came here with

345
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:55,242
是一个可靠而有志气的外交官
was a dependable, ambitious diplomat.

346
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:59,312
但你却用大量的鲜血牺牲
But you are extracting a mass blood sacrifice

347
00:28:59,347 --> 00:29:02,282
来平息你的震怒
to appease your almighty wrath.

348
00:29:02,316 --> 00:29:04,517
你是怎么了?
What's happening to you?

349
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,230
我是罗马的权利工具
I am an instrument of Roman power.

350
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:24,771
我的行为便是那权利的体现和警示
My actions are an expression and a reminder of that power.

351
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:28,808
恰是这权利维系着罗马的统治
And that power sustains Rome.

352
00:29:28,843 --> 00:29:31,578
至高无上的权利
It is paramount.

353
00:29:43,324 --> 00:29:48,361
你永永远远不要插手
You will never, ever involve yourself

354
00:29:48,396 --> 00:29:53,700
你不可能理解的事情
in what you plainly do not understand.

355
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:19,860
其实关于这块地有个小故事 呃
You know, there's a story, and, uh,

356
00:30:19,894 --> 00:30:21,695
也许不过是卖家抬高地价的手段而已
it's probably no more than a means to inflate the price,

357
00:30:21,729 --> 00:30:23,663
但我买下这块地皮的时候
but when I bought this land,

358
00:30:23,698 --> 00:30:26,500
卖家向我保证大卫王曾在这扎营
I was assured King David once made camp here.

359
00:30:26,534 --> 00:30:28,235
这是你买它的原因吗?
Is that why you bought it?

360
00:30:28,269 --> 00:30:31,938
不 我买它只是为了赚钱
No. I bought it to make a profit.

361
00:30:31,973 --> 00:30:34,875
花了一大笔钱
Paid through the nose.

362
00:30:34,909 --> 00:30:37,711
很高兴现在送给了你们
Glad to give you this land.

363
00:30:37,745 --> 00:30:39,212
巴拿巴...
Barnabas...

364
00:30:39,247 --> 00:30:42,382
再好不过了
It's perfect.

365
00:30:42,416 --> 00:30:46,119
一个新的开始
A new beginning.

366
00:30:49,924 --> 00:30:52,525
我妹妹的独子...
My sister's only child...

367
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:57,397
我亲手抱过 教导过 爱过的孩子
A boy I... I cradled, taught, and loved,

368
00:30:57,431 --> 00:31:02,469
此刻正被钉在十字架上
is at this moment hanging from a cross,

369
00:31:02,503 --> 00:31:04,037
为不属于他的罪赎过!
paying a debt that was never his!

370
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:05,672
亲爱的朋友 我心都碎了 过来
Dear friend, I am heartbroken. Come.

371
00:31:05,706 --> 00:31:07,240
- 约瑟  - 我不想听你那套陈词滥调
- Joseph.  - I don't want your platitudes.

372
00:31:07,275 --> 00:31:11,244
我想要的 我们需要的 是结束这一切!
What I want and what we need is for this to end!

373
00:31:14,682 --> 00:31:19,786
你靠着攀附彼拉多才到今天的地位
You've made a career out of being close to Pilate.

374
00:31:19,821 --> 00:31:23,089
现在该是表现的时候了
Make it count for something now.

375
00:31:33,901 --> 00:31:36,536
哪都不安全
Nowhere's safe.

376
00:31:36,571 --> 00:31:37,904
有个地方
There is somewhere.

377
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:40,807
那里的人能宽恕我的罪过
There are people who can forgive my sins.

378
00:31:40,842 --> 00:31:43,143
他们会找到你的
T... they'll find you.

379
00:31:43,177 --> 00:31:47,214
求求你 留在这 陪着我
Please, stay here. Stay with me.

380
00:31:47,248 --> 00:31:48,482
我不能
I can't.

381
00:31:48,516 --> 00:31:51,184
他们会连你也杀了的
They'll kill you, too.

382
00:31:51,219 --> 00:31:53,553
让他们杀吧
Then let them.

383
00:32:26,254 --> 00:32:29,322
彼得
Peter.

384
00:32:29,357 --> 00:32:31,658
你若能过来便是我们的荣幸
We'd be honored if you'd join us.

385
00:32:34,495 --> 00:32:39,800
我能说 我们对你取得的成就敬佩不已吗 彼得?
May I say, we're in awe of what you've achieved here, Peter?

386
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:43,670
这个营地 所有的这些人
This camp, all these people,

387
00:32:43,704 --> 00:32:45,105
他们到此只因为听了你的讲论
they're only here because they heard you speak,

388
00:32:45,139 --> 00:32:46,206
我们也是
ourselves included.

389
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,209
这一切都不能归功于我
None of this is my achievement.

390
00:32:49,243 --> 00:32:52,345
而是拜圣灵所赐
It's the work of the Holy Spirit.

391
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,916
我们在它的面前感到卑微
And we're humbled in its presence.

392
00:33:04,358 --> 00:33:06,726
神啊 我向您大声求告
I cry aloud, aloud to God,

393
00:33:06,761 --> 00:33:09,896
向神求告 请您应允我
aloud to God that he may hear me.

394
00:33:09,931 --> 00:33:12,132
我从没见他这样过
I've never seen him like this.

395
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:14,434
你丈夫的虔诚可嘉
Your husband's devotion is admirable.

396
00:33:14,468 --> 00:33:18,939
我在患难之日求主
In the day of my trouble, I seek the Lord.

397
00:33:18,973 --> 00:33:22,142
他在神前忘我和谦卑来寻求宽慰
He takes comfort in forgetting and humbling himself before God.

398
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,944
我的灵魂无法得到慰藉
My soul refuses to be comforted.

399
00:33:23,978 --> 00:33:25,812
这样看来 你我都是懦夫
In which case, we're all cowards.

400
00:33:25,847 --> 00:33:28,515
不 他所拥有的地位和责任
No, he has a position and a responsibility

401
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:30,550
我们都没有
that none of us have.

402
00:33:30,585 --> 00:33:33,487
你叫我不能闭眼
You hold my eyelids from closing.

403
00:33:33,521 --> 00:33:36,690
我烦乱不安 无法言语
I am so troubled that I cannot speak.

404
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:41,928
神啊 我向您大声求告 向神求告 请您应允我
I cry aloud to God, aloud to God that he may hear me.

405
00:33:41,963 --> 00:33:44,531
我在患难之日求主
In the day of my trouble, I seek the Lord.

406
00:33:51,139 --> 00:33:53,840
波阿斯
Boaz.

407
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,544
我们是要像男人一样好好说话
Shall we talk like men,

408
00:33:57,578 --> 00:33:59,279
还是要像小孩子一样争吵?
or shall we squabble like children?

409
00:33:59,313 --> 00:34:00,947
我们已经谈过了
You and I have already spoken.

410
00:34:00,982 --> 00:34:03,483
如果还是无法达成一致的话 这就不是你该待的地方
If we're still at odds, then this place is not for you.

411
00:34:03,518 --> 00:34:05,352
那我怕我们就要开吵了
Then I fear we are about to squabble.

412
00:34:05,386 --> 00:34:07,387
我不会评判你 我也不知道你为什么在这里
I don't judge you, and I do not know why you're here.

413
00:34:07,421 --> 00:34:09,222
我只知道你所相信的行事方法
I only know that you believe in a course of action

414
00:34:09,257 --> 00:34:12,559
是我不会容忍或宽恕的
that I will not tolerate or condone.

415
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:17,164
但是如果你想要对耶稣
But if you're willing to repent your sins

416
00:34:17,198 --> 00:34:18,198
悔改你的罪...
in the name of Jesus...

417
00:34:18,232 --> 00:34:19,466
我是相信神的人
I am a man of God,

418
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,902
但是我在经上却没有看过
but I do not recognize this name Jesus

419
00:34:21,936 --> 00:34:23,537
耶稣的名字
from the scriptures.

420
00:34:23,571 --> 00:34:27,607
我记得有约书亚 所罗门 大卫王... 都是战士
I recall Joshua, Solomon, King David... all warriors.

421
00:34:27,642 --> 00:34:31,778
你已经迷失在仇恨中了吗?
Are you so lost to hate?

422
00:34:31,812 --> 00:34:35,682
你记得诗篇吗 彼得?
Do you recall the psalms, Peter?

423
00:34:35,716 --> 00:34:42,289
"耶和华我的磐石 是应当称颂的 他教导我的手争战"
"Blessed be the Lord, my rock, who trains my hands for war."

424
00:34:51,666 --> 00:34:55,335
这里有人在利用我们
There are people here who take advantage of us.

425
00:34:55,369 --> 00:34:57,637
那就指名出来 我们会保证他们离开这里
Then name them, and we'll see to it that they leave.

426
00:34:57,672 --> 00:35:00,107
不行
No.

427
00:35:00,141 --> 00:35:02,242
这不是我们做事的方法
It's not the way.

428
00:35:02,276 --> 00:35:06,012
那该做什么?
Then what's to be done?

429
00:35:21,863 --> 00:35:28,902
我们在世上所有的一切 我们都给他
All that we have in the world, we give to him.

430
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,110
你还好吗?
Are you feeling all right?

431
00:35:37,145 --> 00:35:38,745
亚拿尼亚 你的心里有什么
What's in your heart, Ananias,

432
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,247
叫你欺哄圣灵?
to make you lie to the Holy Spirit?

433
00:35:40,281 --> 00:35:42,949
- 什么?  - 你把房子的价银
- What?  - You've kept for yourself

434
00:35:42,984 --> 00:35:45,819
给自己私自留下了一些
some of the money from the sale of your house.

435
00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:49,923
你怎么心里起这意念呢?!
What made you think of doing such a thing?!

436
00:35:49,957 --> 00:35:51,558
无稽之谈
This is absurd.

437
00:35:51,592 --> 00:35:52,859
你欺哄人
You've lied.

438
00:35:52,894 --> 00:35:57,931
不光是欺哄我们 是欺哄神了
Not just to us, but to God.

439
00:36:37,372 --> 00:36:39,739
把他埋了
Bury him.

440
00:36:39,774 --> 00:36:41,374
快去
Now.

441
00:36:53,593 --> 00:36:55,160
彼得
Peter.

442
00:36:56,795 --> 00:36:58,497
发生什么事了?
What's happened?

443
00:36:58,531 --> 00:37:00,632
亚拿尼亚在哪里?
Where's Ananias?

444
00:37:12,745 --> 00:37:15,647
撒非喇
Sapphira.

445
00:37:15,682 --> 00:37:22,755
请你 实话实说
Please, speak truthfully.

446
00:37:22,789 --> 00:37:26,725
你和你的丈夫把房子卖掉的时候
When you and your husband sold your house,

447
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,729
有没有给自己私自留下一些?
did you keep anything back for yourselves?

448
00:37:30,764 --> 00:37:31,964
我们没有
We did not.

449
00:37:31,998 --> 00:37:33,499
你在说谎
You're lying.

450
00:37:33,533 --> 00:37:37,035
我知道你们自己留了一点
I know you held it back.

451
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:39,605
圣灵告诉我的
The Holy Spirit told me so.

452
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:43,542
可能是留了一点 那又有什么关系?
There may have been something, but what does that matter?

453
00:37:43,576 --> 00:37:48,180
我们捐献了很多钱 也乐意如此
We donated a huge amount, and happily so.

454
00:37:48,214 --> 00:37:53,752
这当然有关系 因为你否定了我们的事会成功!
It matters because you bet against our mission succeeding!

455
00:37:53,786 --> 00:37:57,056
你是在否定神啊 撒非喇!
You bet against God, Sapphira!

456
00:37:57,090 --> 00:38:02,194
你们为什么同心试探主的灵呢?
How can you conspire to test the spirit of the Lord?!

457
00:38:02,228 --> 00:38:05,631
这绝无恶意!
It was not malicious in any way!

458
00:38:05,665 --> 00:38:09,535
我们不过是想谨慎一点!
We were simply being prudent!

459
00:38:09,569 --> 00:38:11,703
亚拿尼亚在哪里?
