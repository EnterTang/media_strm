1
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:04,410
亲爱的  过来看看这个
Honey, you got to come see this.

2
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,530
九个月之前

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,990
我要走了
I'm going to go.

4
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,450
带瓦奥莱特去娇家
I'm taking Violet and going to Jo's.

5
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:19,750
去弗罗里达
Florida?

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,250
我想赶在新学年开始前到那
I want to get there before the school year starts.

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,710
我不明白
I don't understand.

8
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:25,720
那去洛杉矶的计划呢
What about Los Angeles?

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,060
我们不是说好在那开始新生活吗
I thought we agreed about the fresh start.

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:30,970
我做不到
I just can't.

11
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,510
-我们努力过了  -我们还没努力呢
- We really tried. - We haven't tried.

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,090
我忍受不了了
I can't do it anymore.

13
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,390
那是治疗  不是努力
Therapy isn't trying.

14
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:37,820
那只是让你把这些事想明白
It's just figuring stuff out

15
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,200
这样你就能真的努力去做些什么
so you can really do something.

16
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,680
我努力了
I've tried,

17
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,680
我越努力想让你重新
and as much as I keep trying

18
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,950
走入我的生活  我心里的坎就越宽
to let you in again, this wall comes up,

19
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,110
我真的跨不过这坎
and I... I can't... I can't get past it.

20
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,580
看看这所房子
Just look at this house.

21
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,220
看看我找到的这所房子  在汉考克公园附近
Look at this house I found. It's right near

22
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,830
周围有很多二十年代的豪宅
Hancock Park, where all those big mansions from the '20s are.

23
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,050
你总说很想要一幢这样的房子
You always talked about how much you wanted a house like this--

24
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,460
这种很有个性的房子
one with personality.

25
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:01,770
这幢就是
Well, here it is.

26
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,070
你还是不明白
You don't listen.

27
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,960
一幢房子解决不了问题  本
The house isn't going to fix it, Ben.

28
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,150
这只是幢房子 小维  答应吧
It's just a house, Viv. Come on.

29
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,980
看一看
Take a look.

30
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,670
它很棒  对吗
It's nice, right?

31
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,650
蒂凡尼的灯饰  还有其他豪华装饰
Tiffany lamps and everything.

32
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,500
我不明白  可能它闹鬼还是怎么的
I don't know, maybe it's haunted or something.

33
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,980
价钱还没定死
I mean, it's still a stretch at that price,

34
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,880
而且它已经挂牌很久还没卖出去
but it's been on the market for a while,

35
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,110
所以价钱可能还会更低
so maybe they'll go lower.

36
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,510
还有间办公室
There's even an office,

37
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,530
这样我就能在家见病人
so I can see patients at home.

38
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,960
它真的很完美
I mean, it's perfect.

39
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,210
不行
No.

40
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,610
亲爱的  你之所以不喜欢
Honey... honey, the reason

41
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,660
我的搬家建议是因为
you can't hold on to this idea of leaving

42
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,760
你不想这样做
is because it's not what you want.

43
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,120
我已经找了一个月房子了
I-I've been looking at houses for a month,

44
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,760
当我看到这所房子时  我发誓
and when I found this one, I swear to God,

45
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,840
就像...就像是
it was like a... it was like a laser beam

46
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,600
醍醐灌顶一样
shot right into my brain.

47
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,680
我能看见咱们以后在那生活的样子
I could see it all so clearly.

48
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,790
就像是过电影一样
It was like a movie in my mind.

49
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,540
咱们全家在一起  你  我还有瓦奥莱特
We were together-- you, me and Violet--

50
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,600
围在壁炉边
all around the fire.

51
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,120
瓦奥莱特在看那些忧郁的俄国小说
Violet was reading some depressing Russian novel,

52
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,350
我在生火
and I was stoking the fire,

53
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,380
你在沙发上哄孩子睡觉
and you were on the couch rocking a baby.

54
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,240
亲爱的  我们以前凭感觉就
Honey... we have made so many life choices

55
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,300
做了很多人生决定  而现在
based on our gut, and right now...

56
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,930
我的感觉告诉我这地方...
my gut is telling me that this place...

57
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,580
这房子会...
this house is going to...

58
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,390
它会让你迈过你心里的那道坎
it's going to break down that wall inside you.

59
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,150
我相信那是所漂亮的房子
I'm sure it's a beautiful house.

60
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,190
我真的非常爱你
I love you so much.

61
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,690
我求你了
I'm begging you...

62
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,660
去看看这房子吧
just come see the house.

63
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,940
我们三个飞过去
The three of us will fly out.

64
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,950
看看这房子
Just come see it.

65
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,970
当我第一次
When I look at this place,

66
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,110
看见这房子时  我感觉
for the first time, I feel...

67
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,940
它似乎充满着希望
like there's hope.

68
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,940
维维安
Vivien?

69
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,660
维维安
Vivien!

70
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,970
瓦奥莱特
Violet!

71
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,260
维维安
Vivien!

72
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,010
你在哪呢  维维安
Where are you, Vivien?

73
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,510
维维安
Vivien!

74
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,730
你在哪啊
Where are you?

75
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,760

80
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,650
我们以为你明天
We weren't expecting you until tomorrow,

81
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,270
-葬礼后才过来呢  -我知道
- after the service. - I know.

82
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,700
但我不能这么麻烦你  康丝坦斯
But I can't impose on you like this, Constance.

83
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,030
别傻了
Don't be silly.

84
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,910
照看这个小天使
Looking after this little angel

85
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,620
可一点都不麻烦
is no imposition whatsoever.

86
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,320
而且我真的不想
And I wouldn't think of burdening you

87
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,190
让你在经历过
with the care of a newborn

88
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,940
那些无可名状的悲剧之后
during this time of your...

89
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,610
就马上担起照看婴儿的责任
unspeakable tragedy.

90
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,490
谢谢  但...
Thank you, but...

91
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,710
维维安的妹妹已经过来了  所以...
Vivien's sister is here now, so...

92
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,180
明白了
Oh, I see.

93
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,440
远亲雪中送炭
What a blessing

94
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,700
是多么温馨啊
distant relations are in times of trouble.

95
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,080
麻烦你把他的东西都交给我吧
If I could just get his things...

96
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,610
当然
Certainly, uh...

97
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,680
但他马上就该吃午饭了
though it is nearly his lunchtime.

98
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,160
让我先把他喂饱
I know-- why don't I feed him?

99
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,660
他就会马上睡着  之后你就可以过来
He'll fall right asleep, and then you can come back

100
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,600
-你可以过几个小时再来  -我可以喂他
- in several hours. - I can feed him.

101
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,340
根本一点都不麻烦
It's really no trouble at all.

102
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,770
我是来接我儿子的  康丝坦斯
I'm here to get my son, Constance.

103
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,680
你儿子  当然了
Your son-- of course.

104
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,060
让我把他的东西收拾一下
Let me just gather up his things.

105
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,070
配方奶要加热了才能喂
This formula has to be warmed up.

106
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,640
你只需在热水管下冲一冲就好
All you have to do is run it under the hot water tap.

107
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,050
我会没事的
I'll be fine.

108
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,500
不  我想你会有事的
No, I don't believe you will.

109
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,630
你要是把孩子带回那房子  他也会出事的
Nor will that child if you take him back into that house.

110
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,830
-把他的东西给我  -哈蒙医生  听我一句
- Just give me his things. - Dr. Harmon, hear me.

111
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,410
那所房子有着可怕的力量
There are forces in that house

112
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,500
他们想要伤害孩子
that mean to do this child grave harm.

113
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,690
你我都心知肚明
We both know that it's true.

114
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,590
就是那力量杀死了你亲爱的妻子
The same forces that killed your sweet wife.

115
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,890
还有你的女儿呢
Oh, and what about your daughter?

116
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,860
告诉我  哈蒙医生
Tell me, Dr. Harmon,

117
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,160
你也给瓦奥莱特预备了口棺材吗
did you buy a casket for Violet, too?

118
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:50,230
如果那房子可以囚禁她的灵魂
If that house can claim her spirit,

119
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,430
它又会对这小宝宝做出什么事情呢
what's going to happen to this sweet little baby?

120
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,610
-孩子不会有事的  -你就是个傻瓜
- The baby's going to be fine. - Oh, you are a fool!

121
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,070
你看到了那么多事
After everything that you've seen...

122
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,640
发生了那么多事
after everything that has happened,

123
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,090
你怎么还这么有眼无珠
how can you still be so blind?

124
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,390
-你好  -我是本·哈蒙  泰特的治疗师
- Hello? - Hey, it's Ben Harmon, Tate's therapist.

125
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:13,590
我打这个电话是想说  我不能再治疗你的儿子了
Yeah, I'm calling because I can't treat your son anymore.

126
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,230
我可以给你另一个精神病医生的电话
I'd like to give you the number of another psychiatrist

127
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,320
我觉得这个医生可以帮到他
who I think could help him.

128
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,690
不是吧  为什么呢  医生
Oh, no, but why, Doctor?

129
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:22,080
因为你儿子和我女儿交往超越了我的底线
Because your son has crossed a line with my daughter.

130
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,840
可是...
Oh, but...

131
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,170
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

132
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,010
他现在在哪
Where is he?

133
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,060
在他的坟墓里
In his grave.

134
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,780
他在那里度过的时光远比活在世上的要长
Where he's been longer than he lived on this Earth.

135
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,630
你毁了我全家
You destroyed my family.

136
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:38,670
都是你
You!

137
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:43,180
你在为自己的罪孽还债  哈蒙医生
You are paying for your own sins, Dr. Harmon.

138
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,070
让我来给你一些建议吧
Let me give you some advice.

139
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,500
在我离开之后
When I leave here,

140
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,040
锁好你的门
lock your door

141
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,310
并且祈祷我不会回来找你算账
and pray I don't come back.

142
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,230
你适应的怎么样了
I wonder, how is your adjustment going?

143
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,510
我必须说  最难的事情
I have to say one of the hardest things

144
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,640
就是看着本
is watching Ben.

145
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,370
他都崩溃了
He's so devastated.

146
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,680
是啊  总是活人让我们难过
Yes, well, it's always the living that make it hard.

147
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,110
亲爱的  你并不用躲开
You don't need to run off, dear.

148
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,210
除非是你想  他是看不见你的
He can't see you unless you want him to.

149
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,290
对啊  总是记不住
Right. Keep forgetting.

150
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,570
我好想亲自照顾他啊
I want to nurse him so badly.

151
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,900
不要啊  本
No, Ben.

152
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,650
别用微波炉加热
Not the microwave.

153
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,610
你这叫阴魂不散  亲爱的
You're hovering, dear.

154
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:37,990
这样不好
It's a bad idea.

155
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,580
瞧  他还记得怎么做
See, he remembered.

156
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,900
他是个好爸爸
He was a good dad.

157
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,070
莫伊拉  我知道你不认同
Moira, I know you don't approve,

158
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,350
但是撇去他的那些缺点
but despite all his flaws...

159
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,980
他真的是个好父亲
he's a good father.

160
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,480
我真不明白你为什么总替他说话
I'll never understand why you always need to come to his defense.

161
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:54,830
来喝吧
Here you go.

162
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,770
你是想让他看见你吗  是这么回事吗
Do you want him to see you? Is that what's going on?

163
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,650
你在纠结要不要现身吗
Are you fighting the desire to appear?

164
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,160
不  我不想让他看见我
No, I do not want him to see me.

165
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,500
我绝对不想让他看见我或瓦奥莱特
I absolutely do not want him to see me or Violet.

166
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,360
我让她跟我保证过
I have made her promise me,

167
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,560
因为如果他看见了我们
because if he see us,

168
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,280
他就会想要留下了
then he is going to want to stay here.

169
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,720
-没事了  小家伙  -而他必须离开这栋房子
- It's okay, kiddo. - And he has to leave this house.

170
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,210
把我们的孩子抚养长大
And raise our baby.

171
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,310
那就乖乖坐下  保持距离
Then sit down and keep your distance.

172
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,060
记着一时软会千古恨
Remember the endgame.

173
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,560
一切都会没事的
It's all going to work out.

174
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,310
本身上有与众不同的地方
There's something about Ben that's different.

175
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,760
他总那么乐观
He's so sanguine.

176
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,080
或许他心里想着他能上手的女人
Perhaps he's dreaming of all the women he can have relations with.

177
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,120
原谅我
Forgive me.

178
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,690
这话不太中听
I suppose that was unkind.

179
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,430
莫伊拉  你能不能帮我泡杯茶
Moira, would you make me a cup of tea, please?

180
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,590
不
No.

181
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,100
你真是出奇的不肯接受现实
Your denial is impressive.

182
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,540
你现在是个鬼魂  哈蒙太太
You're a ghost, Mrs. Harmon.

183
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,230
我不受鬼魂的指使
I don't take orders from ghosts.

184
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,330
在这个世界里  你我是平等的
I'm your equal now in this world.

185
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,220
确实是
So you are.

186
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,090
我向你道歉
I owe you an apology.

187
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,690
我想你应该叫我维维安
And I think you should call me Vivien.

188
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,000
我会的
I'd like that.

189
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,200
维维安  我想说一句
Vivien, if I may...

190
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,050
让他去吧
Leave him be.

191
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,010
别折磨你自己
Don't torture yourself.

192
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,580
这不是你的错
It's not your fault.

193
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,790
你没有错
None of this is.

194
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,200
你娇姨妈很快就到了
Your Aunt Jo's going to be here soon.

195
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,510
好了
Okay.

196
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,140
乖乖
Okay. Okay.

197
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,360
没事了
It's okay.

198
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,170
-你不能这么做  -维维安
- You can't do this. - Vivien.

199
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,890
我就知道你在这里
I knew you were here.

200
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,190
为什么不出来见我
Why didn't you come to me?

201
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:23,150
因为这只会让事情变得更糟
It would just make it worse.

202
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,450
我想让你带着孩子离开这里
I want you to take the baby and go.

203
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,300
让我死  这样我们就能在一起了
No, just let me do it, then we can be together.

204
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,330
不  不行
No, no, no! No.

205
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,520
那孩子需要父亲  本
That baby needs a father, Ben.

206
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,970
我不是他的父亲
I'm not his father.

207
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,720
你我都心知肚明
You know it, and I know it.

208
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,150
他是我的孩子
He's my baby,

209
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,980
而且你现在不该抽烟
and you shouldn't be smoking.

210
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,030
我不管孩子的生父是谁
I don't really care where it came from.

211
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,100
要能照顾他  我愿倾尽所有
I would give anything if I could take care of him.

212
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,670
维维安  我对...
Vivien, I am...

213
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,980
让你遭受的这一切感到非常抱歉
so sorry for everything I put you through.

214
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,660
你听我说
I want you to hear me.

215
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,220
我原谅你了
I forgive you.

216
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,520
我们
So enough

217
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,080
经历了太多悲惨遭遇
with the drama and the tragedy.

218
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,630
这个家已经承受够多了
We've had enough in this family.

219
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,710
已经够了
We've had enough.

220
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,830
现在仅剩的唯一一丝光明
And the one spot of light

221
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:10,620
就是在楼上熟睡的孩子
that there is, is that baby asleep upstairs.

222
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,880
是时候该你做些壮举了
That's your opportunity to do something different.

223
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,210
我想让你抚养这个孩子
I want you to take the baby,

224
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,680
想让你离开这座房子
and I want you to leave this house,

225
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,630
再也不要回来
and I want you to never come back.

226
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:21,330
你妹妹说她会照顾他的
Your sister said she would take care of him.

227
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,460
她是个好母亲
She's a good mother.

228
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,930
不  我不想这样做
No, I don't want that.

229
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:24,960
那你想怎样
What do you want?

230
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,140
我想让你...
I want to...

231
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,950
抱着这个孩子  让他靠在你肩上
envision you with that boy on your shoulders

232
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,010
一起走在纽伯里的街上
walking down Newbury Street.

233
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,330
瓦奥莱特怎么办
What about Violet?

234
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,810
什么叫"瓦奥莱特怎么办"
What about Violet?

235
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:40,190
我都已经十几岁了
I'm a teenage girl.

236
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,040
又不是姗姗学步的婴儿
Not exactly a cakewalk.

237
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,030
瓦奥莱特
Violet.

238
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,890
我到底是怎样的父亲
What kind of father have I been?

239
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,390
你三餐不食  不去学校
You weren't eating. You weren't going to school.

240
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:55,130
你已经过世了  而我却没发觉
You were already gone, and... I didn't get it.

241
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,770
是我将你拒之门外的
I shut you out.

242
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,170
我怕这事会让你崩溃
I was afraid it would break you.

243
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,450
我很想念你
I miss you so much.

244
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,670
我再也上不了哈佛了
I was never getting into Harvard.

245
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,340
但我可为你省下一大笔钱啊
But I saved you a shitload of money.

246
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,980
没错
Yeah, you did.

247
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,110
你得离开这里  爸爸
You have to leave, Dad.

248
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,860
你在这房子多待一分
Every minute you're in this house,

249
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,080
就会危险一分  那个孩子也一样
you're in danger, and so is that baby.

250
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,720
求你了
Please.

251
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,270
就当为了我们
Do it for us.

252
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,400
你要去哪里  本
Where are you going, Ben?

253
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,560
你觉得我会就这么让你走吗
You didn't think I'd just let you leave?

254
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,420
别挡路  海登
Get out of my way, Hayden.

255
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,150
我没时间听你废话
I don't have time for your bullshit.

256
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,100
现在我们可有的是时间了
Now we have all the time in the world.

257
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,130
欢迎  你们一定是雷默斯夫妇吧
Welcome! You must be the Ramos.

258
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,480
是的  我叫史黛西
Yes. I'm Stacy.

259
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,730
这是我丈夫米盖尔
This is my husband Miguel.

260
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,060
-你好  -米盖尔
- Hi. - Miguel.

261
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:13,120
很异域的名字啊  不得不说
What an exotic name. I must confess to a fascination

262
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,070
我对国境之南的一切都异常着迷
for all things south of the border.

263
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:17,100
实际上  我们来自西班牙
Actually, my family's from Spain.

264
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,060
再好不过了
All the better.

265
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,180
我觉得欧洲西班牙裔的人都非常优秀
I find European Hispanics vastly superior.

266
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,570
这是洛杉矶典型的维多利亚时代风格
This is a classic L.A. Victorian,

267
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:27,100
是1920年代由一位享誉盛名的医生所建
built in the 1920s by a doctor to the stars.

268
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,910
正如你们所见  建得精妙绝伦
As you can see, it's just fabulous.

269
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,020
这些蒂凡尼装饰都是真品
These are real Tiffany fixtures.

270
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:35,040
房子里的所有设施都很现代化
Everything else in the house has been updated.

271
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,860
加布里埃尔  等一下
Uh, Gabriel. Hold on.

272
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,460
抱歉  这是我儿子
Uh, I apologize for my son.

273
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,840
很明显  他总是带着他的滑板
Apparently he's got the skateboard

274
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,480
形影不离
surgically attached to his body.

275
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,830
他到哪儿到带着它
He doesn't go anywhere without it.

276
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,430
没关系  雷默斯先生
It's quite all right, Mr. Ramos.

277
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,990
只要别在地板上留下刮痕就行了
As long as we don't leave any marks on the floor.

278
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,690
还需要再等其他孩子吗
Are we waiting for another sibling?

279
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:53,280
不  就一个  谢谢
No, we just have the one. Thank you.

280
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:56,520
家具是前一任房主留下的
The furnishing is from the previous owner,

281
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,040
但如果你们看中哪件
but if you see anything that you like,

282
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,700
我想这些家具也是可以
I'm sure the estate is open to selling

283
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,220
适价出售的
at the right price.

284
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:06,420
这里真棒  宝贝  看看这屋子
This is amazing, babe. Look at this house.

285
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,220
说到钱  玛西  我也知道经济不景气
Um, speaking of money, Marcy, I know the, uh, economy is down,

286
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:15,310
但何故要价会低于市价这么多呢
but why is the asking price so far below market?

287
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,750
不会有霉菌或氡气的问题吧
There isn't a problem with mold or radon, is there?

288
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,080
不  原因再简单不过
No. Nothing so simple.

289
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,300
由于要公开透明化
In the interest of full disclosure,

290
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,840
我得告诉你们之前的屋主
I must inform you that the previous owners passed away

291
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:26,820
死在了这里
in the house.

292
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,870
怎么回事
Oh. How?

293
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,610
妻子因难产而死
The wife died during childbirth,

294
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:35,370
于是丈夫悲痛万分而自杀了
and the husband, in his grief, committed suicide.

295
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,860
他在二楼的天花板上自缢
He hung himself from the second-story balcony.

296
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,270
实在是一个悲剧浪漫爱情故事
It's a tragically romantic love story.

297
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,570
这是他们的狗狗  海莉
This is their dog, Hallie.

298
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,490
她是哈蒙一家仅剩的成员
She's the only remaining member of the Harmon family.

299
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,330
我收养了她
I've adopted her.

300
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,560
至少他们不是枉死
Well, at least they weren't murdered.

301
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,590
雷默斯太太
Mrs. Ramos.

302
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:58,540
带你去看别的房子也可以
I'd be happy to show you another house.

303
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,730
但无论搬进哪一座
But no matter where you go,

304
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,870
前人的痕迹  总是挥之不去
you'll be moving into somebody's history.

305
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:05,240
只不过这间屋子20万美元就可以买到
Only this one can be had for $200,000

306
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,730
比我上一次卖掉它的时候还便宜
less than the last time I sold it.

307
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,580
你觉得如何  加布
What do you think, Gabe?

308
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,470
我不信鬼怪
I don't believe in ghosts.

309
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,520
他当然会这么说了
Of course he would say that.

310
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,420
我们还要继续参观屋子吗
Should we continue the tour?

311
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,380
当然
Yes. Sure.

312
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,880
我想你们一定会爱上这厨房的
I know you're going to love the kitchen.

313
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,660
它配有大理石料理台
It's got marble countertops,

314
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,010
一个早餐角
a breakfast nook,

315
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:30,110
还有  你们见过煮面加水器吗
and have you ever seen a pasta arm?

316
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,250
-没有  -没有
- No. - No.

317
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,920
我也没亲眼见过  我独居
Personally, I haven't-- I live alone--

318
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,530
不过哈蒙太太自诩是个美食家
but Mrs. Harmon fancied herself a bit of a gourmet.

319
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,930
看一下后院的凉亭
Notice the gazebo in the backyard.

320
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,760
你没事吧
You okay?

321
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,230
没事
Yeah.

322
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,900
我  我滑倒了
I-I slipped.

323
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,900
妈  妈妈在哪里
Where-where's Mom?

324
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,500
她走进厨房的那一刻
Oh, the second she stepped foot in the kitchen,

325
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,680
我方就沦陷了
it was game over.

326
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,540
我想我们要买一间屋子了
I think we just bought ourselves a house.

327
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,100
来吧  你得看看这屋子的其他地方
Come on, you gotta check out the rest of this place.

328
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,290
肯定有地方能放张桌球台
There's definitely room for a pool table.

329
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:44,880
想象一下盛夏的时候浅酌着莫吉托鸡尾酒
Imagine sipping a nice Mojito on a hot summer day.

330
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,020
你们应该比我们这些美国佬要耐热吧
I guess you folks tolerate the heat better than us gringos.

331
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,170
我说的对吗
Am I right?

332
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,770
已出售

333
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,020
我看到又有新的一家人搬到你隔壁了
I see you've got a new family moving in next door.

334
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,680
没错  我注意到了
Yes, I noted that.

335
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:15,590
我真心希望他们  待人友善
Oh, I do hope they're a... nice family.

336
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,310
我还要亲自上门恭贺乔迁
I'd go over there and welcome them personally,

337
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:23,470
但可以想见  回到那间屋子
but as you may imagine, returning to that house

338
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,200
对我来说很艰难
is difficult for me.

339
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,660
在我目睹了那些事以后
After what I saw.

340
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,650
你个傻逼
You stupid son of a bitch.

341
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:40,280
拜托别告诉我你们还有坏消息
Please tell me that you're not here with any more bad news.

342
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,220
事实上  没有什么确切的消息
No real news, actually.

343
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,590
那你们还没有找到那个小宝贝吗
So you still haven't found that precious baby?

344
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:47,410
-完全没有踪影  -真是  令人担忧
- No trace. - That's very... worrying.

345
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,470
我们想再听你说一次事情经过
We'd like to go over your statement again.

346
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,170
以确保我们没有遗漏任何事
Just to make sure we didn't miss anything.

347
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,230
-当然  -你说你
- Of course. - You said you'd

348
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:56,910
在七点半左右到哈蒙家
gone over to the Harmons' at approximately 7:30 p.m.

349
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,290
探望哈蒙医生和他的女儿
to check on Dr. Harmon and his daughter.

350
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,780
在按了门铃却无人应门之后
After ringing the bell and getting no response,

351
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,830
你决定自己进去
you decided to enter the premises.

352
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:07,080
已有太多悲剧在那里发生
Being no stranger to tragedy,

353
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,240
所以我相当担心
I was understandably concerned.

354
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,620
结果证明我所猜无误
Prescient, as it turned out.

355
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,730
你个傻逼
You stupid son of a bitch.

356
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,300
我真不敢相信她杀了我
I can't believe she killed me.

357
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,050
你活该
Serves you right.

358
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,790
我直觉就想逃离那里
My first instinct was to flee.

359
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:27,110
想大叫着飞奔而出绝不回头
To run screaming and never return.

360
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,900
但后来我想到了那个孩子
But then I thought of the baby.

361
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,030
靠
Shit.

362
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,400
爸爸
Dad?

363
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,240
真是感人肺腑
Well, that's all very touching.

364
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,060
但孩子上哪去了
But where the hell's the baby?

365
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:53,170
于是我就去找哈蒙家的女儿
So I went searching for the Harmons' daughter.

366
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,920
当我发现她也已经死了
And when I discovered that she was gone, too...

367
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,970
我就知道到底发生了什么
I understood what must have happened.

368
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,050
你来看我的孩子吗
Have you come to see my baby?

369
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,770
我来带走我孙子
I've come to fetch my grandson.

370
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,300
你说带走就带走吗
Oh, you think so?

371
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,290
哈蒙太太站在我这边
Mrs. Harmon agrees with me.

372
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,820
孩子可不能在死者之屋长大
House of the dead is no place to raise a child.

373
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,400
这孩子就可以
It is for this baby.

374
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,730
-他很特别  -他是我的
- He's special. - He's mine.

375
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,580
除非我死
Over my dead body.

376
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,090
你不都已经死了吗
We're well past that.

377
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,310
操
Aw, shit.

378
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:37,260
瓦奥莱特抢过孩子  逃之夭夭
Violet took that child, and fled.

379
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,730
谁知道逃到哪里去了
God knows where.

380
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,670
但我每晚
But I keep them both

381
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:43,340
都不忘记为他俩祈祷
in my prayers, every night.

382
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,020
那么
Well...

383
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,370
如果  你想起瓦奥莱特说过
If you, uh, think of anything Violet said to you

384
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,140
任何有关她行踪的信息
that could, uh, indicate where she might have gone,

385
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,480
你就告诉我们
you will let us know?

386
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,110
一定立刻通知你们
Oh, without hesitation.

387
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,030
感谢你抽出时间见我们
Thank you for your time.

388
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,050
谁是我的宝贝小天使
Who's my good little angel, huh?

389
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,790
谁是我的宝贝小天使
Who's my good little angel?

390
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,830
你就是我的宝贝小天使
Oh, there's my good little angel.

391
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,200
你是谁
Who are you?

392
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,060
你对音乐的品味可真不怎么样
You have awful taste in music.

393
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,650
美国德克萨斯州迷幻朋克乐队
屁眼冲浪者乐队
Butthole Surfers?

394
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,380
喂  你这算私闯民宅
Hello? Breaking and entering.

395
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,240
你是谁
Who are you?

396
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,550
我死后的鬼魂
A ghost of my former self.

397
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,970
瓦奥莱特  我住在附近
Violet. I live in the neighborhood.

398
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,360
你的手冷冰冰的
Your hand's cold.

399
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:03,220
俗话说得好
You know what they say.

400
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,650
手冷心热
Cold hands, warm heart.

401
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,680
美国第一支朋克乐队
-喂  -你连雷蒙斯乐队的唱片都没有吗
- Yo! - Don't you have any Ramones?

402
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,390
1984和1986年雷蒙斯乐队的两张专辑
比如"野性男孩"  或者"坚韧不死"
Like "Animal Boy", or "Too Tough To Die"?

403
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,120
喂  离开我的房间
Hey. Get out of my room.

404
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,250
你确定想一个人待着吗
Are you sure you want to be alone?

405
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,580
传闻这房子充满了游荡的孤魂
They say this house is haunted.

406
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,410
你神经不正常  是吧
You're kind of twisted, aren't you?

407
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,580
你无法想象
You don't know the half of it.

408
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,180
你还好吗
You okay?

409
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,470
还好  地板有点不正常
Yeah. This floor is warped.

410
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,950
你知道什么不正常吗
You know who's warped?

411
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,490
那个房产经纪人玛西
That realtor, Marcy.

412
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,720
有吗  我觉得她很性感
You think? I think she's hot.

413
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,230
性感火辣
Red hot.

414
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,600
性感撩人
Smokin' hot.

415
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,350
是吗
Really?

416
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,500
看来我得提防下那个婊子了
I may have to waste that bitch, then.

417
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,470
恕我没那么多体力让你俩分享
Hey. There's enough of me to go around.

418
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,650
我可不喜欢与人分享
Well, I'm not into sharing.

419
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,810
咱们今晚就给房子洗礼如何
Are we gonna christen the house tonight?

420
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,420
这答案你喜欢吗
Does this answer your question?

421
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,150
喜欢得不得了
This does.

422
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:25,240
宝贝  加布就在楼上
Babe... Gabe's upstairs.

423
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,160
我记得当年我们也同他俩一样
I remember when we were like that.

424
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,420
在一切尚未发生之前
In the beginning.

425
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,700
未完待续
To be continued.

426
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,800
-说到这里  -怎么了
- On that note. - Yes?

427
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,940
加布今年就毕业了
Gabe's graduating this year.

428
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,100
这房子又这么大
This house is so big.

429
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,400
你不觉得就咱倆的话有点空荡荡吗
Do you think we'll be lonely?

430
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,590
想要个孩子
A baby?

431
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,310
你不觉得我太老了吗
Don't you think I'm too old?

432
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,480
马上就老了  快了
Almost. Almost.

433
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,760
所以要把握大好时光
So we should get going.

434
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,440
在这房子里  我失去了两个孩子
I lost two babies in this house.

435
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,940
其中一个都没有呼出一口气就死了
One of them never even took a breath,

436
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,190
另一个被康丝坦斯偷走了
and Constance stole the other one.

437
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:28,040
至少他离开了这栋凶宅
At least he's out of this house.

438
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,020
他们看起来这么幸福
They seem like such a nice couple.

439
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,770
他们不能在这栋房子里有孩子
They can't have a baby in this house.

440
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,220
你说得对
You're right.

441
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,710
我们得采取点行动
We have to do something.

442
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:40,560
你们得伸出援手
You're going to need help.

443
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,830
凶宅里有些鬼魂满怀仇怨
Some spirits in the house are angry and vengeful,

444
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:47,360
一心将他们的命运报复到别人身上
and eager to inflict their fate on others.

445
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:52,020
但是大部分鬼魂是无辜  善良的冤魂
But many of us are innocent, kind, blameless victims

446
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,430
死于他人之手
at the hands of another.

447
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,270
我们不想再看到有人在这里受折磨
And we don't want to see more suffering in this house.

448
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,560
你梦见了什么
What were you dreaming about?

449
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,330
操
Shit!

450
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:14,690
我想我知道
Bet I know.

451
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:19,880
如果我能做梦的话  也会梦见她
I'd dream about her, too, if I could dream.

452
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:22,390
可我不会再做梦了
I don't think I do anymore.

453
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,960
见鬼  你是谁
What the hell? Who are you?

454
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,920
你在我房间里做什么
What are you doing in my room?

455
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,400
这曾经是我的房间
This used to be my room.

456
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,770
之后变成她的房间
And then it was hers.

457
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,330
你在说什么啊
What are you talking about?

458
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:34,260
瓦奥莱特
Violet.

459
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:37,460
她曾是我的女朋友
She was my girlfriend.

460
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,830
之前那个诡异的小妞
The freaky chick from before?

461
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,550
你这个"诡异"是什么意思
What do you mean by freaky?

462
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,390
她看起来挺酷的  我俩之间没什么
She seemed really cool. Nothing happened.

463
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,300
她没说她有男朋友了
She didn't say she had a boyfriend.

464
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,300
我们分手了
We kind of broke up.

465
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:51,790
这样啊
Right.

466
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,080
我是说
Well, I mean...

467
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,060
这女孩我不能染指  伙计  我懂了
It's totally hands off, dude. I get it.

468
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,120
不
No...

469
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,780
我想你不懂
I don't think you do.

470
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,450
该死
Shit!

471
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:06,620
妈妈
Mom?!

472
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:11,480
我的老天
Oh, my God!

473
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,570
米盖尔  米盖尔
Miguel! Miguel!

474
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:28,970
米盖尔
Miguel!

475
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,450
离我远点  离我远点
Stay away from me. Stay away from me.

476
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,560
滚开
Get away from me!

477
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,110
滚开
Get away from me!

478
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,730
滚
Get away!

479
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,950
-呆着  别动  -你到底想干吗
- No! You stay here! - What do you want?!

480
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:47,300
加布
Gabe!

481
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,860
加布
Gabe!

482
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,490
加布
Gabe!

483
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:52,620
为什么
Why?!

484
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,240
为什么
Why?!

485
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:56,240
不要
No!

486
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,620
为什么
Why?!

487
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,500
我想让她快乐
I want her to be happy.

488
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:02,200
我看得出来  她喜欢你
She liked you, I could tell.

489
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,160
-你是个好人吧  -什么
- You're a good guy, right? - What?

490
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,390
你朋友很多
I mean, you got all these friends

491
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:07,400
喜欢运动
and you played some sports.

492
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:08,790
学习也很好  对吗
You make good grades, right?

493
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,400
一般般
Average.

494
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,470
一般就是很好
Average is good.

495
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,600
正常很好
Normal is good.

496
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,470
她该有正常的生活
She deserves normal.

497
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:15,950
给我滚远点
Get out of my way!

498
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:20,040
我不想伤害你
I don't want to hurt you!

499
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,990
不过我的确得杀了你
Though I do have to kill you.

500
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,880
米盖尔
Miguel...

501
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,700
你该睁开双眼
it's time for you to open your eyes

502
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,900
看清这里的样子和对你的影响
and see what this place is, what it can do.

503
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:40,530
我要有人来感受我的痛苦
I need someone to feel my pain.

504
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,430
我来带路吧
Let me lead you.

505
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,360
看看他对我做了什么
Look what he did to me.

506
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:04,460
快跑

507
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,980
你为什么要这么做
Why are you doing this?

508
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:12,020
我告诉过你了  我们之间什么都没发生
Please, I told you, man, nothing happened!

509
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,270
你能不能别看着我
Could you maybe not look at me?

510
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,820
-什么  -你能不能...
- What? - I mean, could you...

511
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,750
你能不能站起来
could you, like, stand up or...

512
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:27,020
或者转过去什么的
I don't know, turn around or something?!

513
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,800
求你了
Please...

514
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,690
别杀我
don't kill me.

515
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:36,300
这不是针对你
Oh, it's nothing personal.

516
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,590
她那么孤单
It's just that she's all alone.

517
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,860
不该这样的  站起来
And that's not right! Stand up!

518
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,480
神父啊
Padre.

519
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,960
别白费力气了  快点
Stop that, stop that. Come on.

520
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:48,120
转过去
Turn around.

521
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:51,130
真调皮
Naughty boy.

522
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,990
史黛西会怎么想
What would Stacy think?

523
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,630
天啊  我在做梦呢
Oh, God, I'm dreaming.

524
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,410
你清醒着呢
You're wide awake.

525
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,520
天啊
Oh, God!

526
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,810
天啊
God!

527
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:41,120
米盖尔
Miguel!

528
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,420
史黛西
Stacy!

529
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,010
史黛西
Stacy?

530
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:49,480
-米盖尔  -史黛西
- Miguel! - Stacy!

531
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,440
放开她
Leave her alone!

532
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,350
-本  本  -滚开
- Ben! Ben! - Get away from her.

533
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,180
本
Ben.

534
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,510
你这个变态的混蛋
You sick, perverted bastard.

535
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,640
他们才搬进来
They're barely moved in,

536
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,690
你就开始觅食了吗
you're already preying on the new meat?

537
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,410
你们究竟是什么人
Who the hell are you people?

538
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,480
他生前是我丈夫
He used to be my husband.

539
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,280
你们不知道  我早就想这么做了
You have no idea how long I've been wanting to do that.

540
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:24,730
你们不知道  我早就想这么做了
You have no idea how long I've wanted to do that.

541
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,830
这就是你们的下场
This is what it does to you.

542
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,000
这栋房子
This house.

543
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,600
快跑
Run.

544
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:53,640
泰特  别
Tate, no.

545
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,880
放下刀  泰特
Put down the knife, Tate.

546
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,020
不行
I can't.

547
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,800
我是为了你
I'm doing this for you.

548
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,550
我没能救你
I couldn't save you.

549
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,010
都是我的错  才让你这么孤单
It's my fault you're alone.

550
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:06,540
我不孤单啊  我的家人都在
But I'm not alone. My family's here now.

551
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,700
不够
It's not enough.

552
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,060
你需要有人陪
You need someone.

553
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:09,880
那个人不是他
Not him.

554
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,410
那你想要谁
Then what do you want?!

555
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,030
我之前想要的是你
What I wanted was you.

556
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:25,000
你叫我走开的
You told me to go away.

557
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,940
但我还没能道别
But I never said good-bye.

558
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,540
过来  让我跟你道别吧
Come let me say good-bye.

559
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,050
再见了  泰特
Good-bye, Tate.

560
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,320
加布  加布  快点
Gabe! Gabe, come on!

561
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,560
快点  快点  快点
Come on, come on, come on.

562
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:43,020
又有别的倒霉蛋要搬进来了
Some other poor family's just gonna move in here.

563
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,220
他们根本不知道自己要住进的是什么地方
Suckers who will have no idea what they're in for.

564
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:55,360
而我们就知道该怎么做了
And we know exactly what to do.

565
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:12,560
本次旅行包括了这座天使之城
Our tour concludes with one of the most famous

566
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,010
最著名的凶宅
houses of horror in the City of Angels.

567
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:18,730
最近哈蒙一家的血腥惨剧
And the recent and bloody tragedy of the Harmon family...

568
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:19,400
这没有什么好看的
No, there's nothing to see here.

569
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,640
让这个凶宅更加的
...only adds to the infamy of

570
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,400
声明狼藉
the Murder House!

571
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:24,980
我还得把这个房子卖掉
I have to sell this house.

572
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,480
离开这
Get out of here!

573
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,390
已经够了
It's enough already!

574
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,250
这样我怎么把它卖掉
Now I have to sell this house!

575
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,370
你有时间吗
Have you got a minute?

576
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:37,930
我知道  我是你现在最不想看见的人
I know. I'm the last person you want to see right now.

577
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:39,370
你根本不是人
You're not a person.

578
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,730
你就是个怪物
You're a monster.

579
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,650
我很还念我们以前的治疗  本
I really miss our talks, Ben.

580
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:45,930
它们真的帮了我很多
They were really helping me.

581
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,800
放屁
Bullshit.

582
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,680
你就是个精神病  泰特
You're a psychopath, Tate.

583
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:52,710
你心理失常  心理治疗根本没用
It's a mental disorder, and therapy can't cure it.

584
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,820
这就是你的诊断  我是个精神病
So that's your diagnosis? I'm a psychopath?

585
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,390
是  而且是最糟糕的那种
Yep, and the worst kind.

586
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,990
你魅力非凡  惹人注目
You're charismatic and compelling

587
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,670
还是个病态的骗子
and a pathological liar.

588
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,490
不过别听我的  我也是个骗子
But don't listen to me. I'm a total fraud.

589
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:04,750
顺便说下  心理治疗根本没有用
And by the way, therapy doesn't work.

590
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,730
没有用  那为什么这些人要治疗
It doesn't work? Then why do people do it?

591
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:07,280
因为它们不想
Because they don't wanna

592
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,390
为自己的糟糕生活负一点责任
to take any responsibility for their crappy lives!

593
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,340
所以他们付钱让治疗师来听他们的废话
So they pay a therapist to listen to their bullshit

594
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:16,750
让这一切都变得特别
and make it all feel... special.

595
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,310
他们就不会责怪他们的疯老妈
So they can blame their crazy mothers

596
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,700
搞砸了一切
for everything that went wrong.

597
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,300
耳熟吗
Sound familiar?

598
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:27,050
真是个好买卖
It's a great racket, too.

599
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:27,860
一周又一周
Week after week,

600
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,840
一月又一月  一年又一年
month after month, year after year

601
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,860
我们收着钱  但心里知道那根本没用
we collect checks, but deep down we know it doesn't work.

602
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,710
你个婊子养的
You son of a bitch.

603
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,110
我们是一类人  泰特
We're not so different, Tate.

604
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:42,470
但我也是个坏人
I'm a bad person, too.

605
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:47,040
我伤害了我最应该去爱的人
I hurt the people I was supposed to... love the most.

606
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,180
但是她们原谅了你  对吗
But they forgave you, right?

607
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,470
也许瓦奥莱特也会原谅我
Maybe Violet will forgive me, too.

608
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,120
她不会  人们可以去原谅那些
She can't. You can only forgive someone

609
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,580
直接伤害自己的人
for what they've done to you directly.

610
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,910
那些你杀掉的人
Those people you murdered?

611
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:02,300
只有他们才可以宽恕你
They're the only ones who can forgive you,

612
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:05,350
但你没有给他们机会
and you took away their chance.

613
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:07,320
就这样吗
So this is it?

614
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,720
我什么都做不了了吗
There's no... there's nothing I can do?

615
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:12,740
不能获得宽恕了吗
There's no chance of mercy?

616
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:21,720
戏演得真棒  泰特
Terrific performance, Tate.

617
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:26,210
受到误解的孩子的那套把戏
The whole misunderstood kid act? Oh...

618
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,460
我上当了  瓦奥莱特也上当了
I fell for it, Violet did, too.

619
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:32,150
但是一个精神病  定义上来讲
But a psychopath, by definition,

620
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,340
是不会感到后悔的
is incapable of remorse.

621
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,720
所以  拜托  我们再来一次
So, come on, let's try this again

622
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:38,340
说点真的
for real this time.

623
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,410
你
You...

624
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:44,840
毁掉了我最在乎的一切
destroyed everything that mattered most to me.

625
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:48,000
你现在还会想从我这里得到什么
What could you possibly want from me now?

626
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,990
我不知道定义是怎么说的
I don't know about definitions,

627
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:53,770
但我真的很后悔  本
but I really am sorry, Ben.

628
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,500
对你最感到愧疚
To you more than anyone.

629
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,640
说抱歉很容易
Sorrys are easy.

630
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,640
不如对你的所作所为负起责任吧
What about taking responsibility for the things you've done?

631
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:08,270
天哪  你连那些话都说不出来
Christ, you can't even say the words.

632
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,640
在1994年
In 1994...

633
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,860
我放火烧伤我妈妈的男朋友
I set my mom's boyfriend on fire...

634
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:21,640
然后我射杀了西田高中的15个学生
...and then I shot and killed 15 kids at Westfield High.

635
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,350
我杀死了在你们之前
I murdered the gay couple

636
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:25,020
住在这里的那对同性恋
who lived here before you...

637
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,660
我还强奸了你的老婆
...and I raped your wife.

638
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:30,940
还有其他的事情
There were other things, too.

639
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,380
其他我伤害的人
Other people I hurt.

640
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,970
我会告诉你所有的事
I'll tell you everything.

641
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,400
我不是你的神父  泰特
I'm not your priest, Tate.

642
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,960
我不能赦免你任何的罪
I can't absolve you for any of this.

643
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,240
对  我懂
Right, I get that.

644
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,540
但是你能不能
But can you just...

645
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,960
偶尔跟我聊聊
...hang out with me sometimes?

646
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:30,160
有人吗
Hello?

647
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,370
有人吗
Hello?

648
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,070
谢天谢地你来了
Oh, thank God you're here.

649
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,600
我累坏了
I'm so exhausted.

650
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:38,690
你是新来的保姆
You're the new nanny?

651
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:39,880
谁啊
Hello?

652
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,860
-诺拉  -请叫我蒙哥马利太太
- Nora? - Mrs. Montgomery, please.

653
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,420
母亲说这是必须遵守的规矩
Mother taught me that's a rule to live by:

654
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:49,710
决不能让仆人喊我的名字
never allow the help to call you by your first name, so...

655
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,040
这是不是我的孩...
Is that my ba...

656
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:59,850
蒙哥马利太太  请原谅
Uh, forgive me, Mrs. Montgomery.

657
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:01,670
我本会早点儿来的  可我
I would have come sooner, but I...

658
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,560
我以为他没活下来  胎死腹中
I didn't think he made it; I thought he was stillborn.

659
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,690
差点儿
Nearly.

660
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,570
他哭了一声  就过世了
He made one tiny little cry and then passed on.

661
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:12,360
显然只有我见证了这一幕  查尔斯没看见
Apparently, I'm the only one who witnessed it; Charles didn't.

662
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,470
他真是天才
Genius.

663
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:18,550
我告诉你  这孩子闷闷不乐
He's an unhappy child, I'll tell you that.

664
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,500
是你啊  你是孩子的亲妈
Oh, it's you-- the birth mother.

665
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,000
可能是因为你怀孕时营养不良
Perhaps it was your poor nutrition

666
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,340
或者是遗传缺陷
or just your genetic inferiority.

667
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:30,030
反正我很不满意  这孩子病怏怏的
In any case, I'm quite dissatisfied. He's a weakling.

668
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,280
至少他的肺很强壮  我在楼上都能听见他的哭声
Well, his lungs are strong; I could hear him upstairs.

669
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,650
我能抱抱吗
May I?

670
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:37,120
不行  把手拿开
No, hands off!

671
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:40,110
你们这些人  以为可以突然出现
You people-- you think you can just show up

672
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:42,740
说你有权把亲儿子要回去  但这事早安排好了
and claim some sort of birthright, but arrangements were made.

673
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,730
这孩子是我的
This baby is mine.

674
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,880
我理解
I understand.

675
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:51,420
但我知道些办法
But I do know some... some tricks that might

676
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,060
可以让他安静下来
be helpful to quiet him down.

677
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:16,010
你给他起了什么名字
What do you call him?

678
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,010
小哭闹鬼
Little Noisy Monster.

679
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,180
别哭  小宝宝*
*Hush, little baby

680
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,090
别出声*
*Don't say a word

681
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:31,240
妈妈给你买只小鸟*
*Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird

682
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:35,650
要是小鸟不唱歌*
*If that mockingbird don't sing

683
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:40,950
爸爸就给你买个钻戒*
*Papa's gonna buy you a diamond ring.

684
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:44,100
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

685
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:46,760
我原本还担心
I was actually afraid

686
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,960
要是他这么哭下去  我会伤害他
I might harm him if he didn't quiet down.

687
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:52,510
几天来我怎么哄他都不管用
He has been inconsolable for days and days.

688
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,490
折腾的我筋疲力尽
I am so exhausted.

689
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,680
我的天  我觉得自己需要
Oh, dear, I think I might need to...

690
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:02,060
歇会儿
take a rest.

691
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:06,260
要不你晚上帮我照顾他吧
Perhaps you could keep him for the night.

692
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:09,970
歇去吧  蒙哥马利太太  你得好好休息
You take a rest, Mrs. Montgomery. You need a nice rest.

693
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,910
我们会没事的
We'll be fine.

694
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,400
我不太确定自己是否有耐心做母亲
I'm not entirely sure I have the patience to be a mother.

695
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:30,740
大概因为我换了那么多讨厌的保姆
Probably all of those hideous nannies.

696
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,510
但说实话  我妈也好不到哪儿去
Mother wasn't very good at it either, truth be told.

697
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:41,520
是叫你尼古拉斯好呢
Are you gonna be a Nicholas?

698
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:43,900
还是叫约拿好呢
Or a Jonah?

699
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,910
要不叫杰弗里吧
Or a Jeffrey?

700
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,880
叫你小杰弗里好吗
Are you gonna be a little Jeffrey?

701
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,380
你想叫什么名字呢  小宝贝
Who are you gonna be, little guy?

702
00:42:57,850 --> 00:42:59,210
莫伊拉  你在干嘛呢
Moira, what are you doing?

703
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:01,820
我在用醋擦柜子呢  哈蒙太太
Scouring the cabinets with vinegar, Mrs. Harmon.

704
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:02,710
那家人搬走时
I... I just noticed how

705
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:05,220
我留意到柜子有点粘粘的
sticky they were when the new family moved out.

706
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,230
我也不知道自己该做什么好
I don't know what else to do with myself.

707
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:10,500
我只懂打扫  所以我接着干下去吧
Cleaning is what I'm good at, so I'll just carry on.

708
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,890
莫伊拉  我同情你
Sorry, Moira.

709
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:14,030
快看这是谁
Look who I found.

710
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:16,700
他原本在地下室里
He was in the basement.

711
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:19,680
他和诺拉在那下面  不停地哭
He was down there with Nora, wouldn't stop crying.

712
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,620
我就知道她不会带孩子
I knew she couldn't handle him.

713
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,650
她不是真的想要带孩子
She doesn't really want a baby.

714
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,780
她只是抱着这个想法不放
She just got stuck on that idea.

715
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:27,950
她就不是做母亲的料
Not a motherly bone in her body, that one.

716
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:30,520
你想抱抱他吗
Do you want to hold him?

717
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:39,290
抱稳了
Here you go.

718
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:48,660
真是个娇弱的小东西
He's such a frail little thing.

719
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,500
皮肤像水蜜桃一样粉嫩
His skin is like peaches.

720
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,920
我要不是那么风骚
I would have made a good mother,

721
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,970
肯定也能做个好妈妈
if I hadn't been such a little tramp.

722
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:56,860
不好意思
Forgive me.

723
00:43:56,860 --> 00:44:00,550
老仆女的自怨自艾是最让人受不了的
There's nothing worse than a self-pitying old maid.

724
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:06,340
我需要人帮忙一起照顾他
You know, I'm gonna need so much help with him.

725
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:09,700
我不能接受这个职务  我不懂带孩子
I can't accept such a position. I'm not trained as a nanny.

726
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:13,220
我不是想让你为我们工作
I wasn't thinking that you would come work for us.

727
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:17,220
我是想问你  你愿不愿意做他的教母
I was gonna ask you if you wanted to be his godmother.

728
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:25,750
如果这能让你觉得安稳些
If that'd make you feel safer...

729
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:33,050
我觉得你能成为这个家庭很好的一员
I think you'd be a great addition to the family.

730
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:41,300
我在阁楼上找到了这些东西
I found these in the attic.

731
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:44,960
这些装饰品真古老
These ornaments are ancient.

732
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:46,640
确实很古老
I suppose they are.

733
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:49,140
瓦奥莱特  你会明白的
You'll come to understand, Violet,

734
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,370
如果你的生命停留在今天
that the word "ancient" will lose all its meaning

735
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:54,130
"古老"这个词将毫无意义
when your entire existence is one long today.

736
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:57,810
好  大家准备好了吗
Okay, everybody ready?

737
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:02,260
瞧瞧
Look at that.

738
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:06,350
我很自豪的说  是我亲自砍回来的
I chopped it down myself, I'm proud to say.

739
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:11,030
你们见过如此漂亮的东西吗
Have you ever seen anything so beautiful?

740
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:14,140
我见过
I have!

741
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:17,340
瞧瞧他  他真可爱
Look at him. He's so amazing.

742
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,880
性格特别好  从来不哭
Best temperament. Hardly ever cries.

743
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:22,670
真像他爸爸
Looks like his daddy.

744
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:28,030
-想抱抱他吗  -好
- Want to hold him? - Mm-hmm.

745
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:30,730
抱稳了
Here you go.

746
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:42,640
维维安  我从来没奢望过
I didn't think it was possible for me, Vivien...

747
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:46,690
但我确实很幸福
but I'm happy.

748
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:03,860
兰波  19世纪法国天才诗人  为情痴狂
别自作多情了  兰波
Grow a pair, Rimbaud.

749
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,770
她不在乎你
She's not into you.

750
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:07,780
她心里不会再有你的位置
You're not getting back into her.

751
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:09,640
她永远都不会再理你了
She'll never talk to you again.

752
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:11,580
我等她
I'll wait.

753
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,990
等到她接受为止
Forever, if I have to.

754
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:19,600
三年后

755
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,340
你今天想不想
How would you feel

756
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:25,730
好好露一手啊  海伦
about working a miracle today, Helen?

757
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:28,760
康丝坦斯  难得你大驾光临啊
Constance, you get your ass in my chair!

758
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,670
最近忙什么呢  美女
Oh, where you been, girl?

759
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:32,700
还以为你嫌弃我们家找新发廊了呢
I was starting to think you found yourself another salon.

760
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:35,780
当然不是   不  不  不
Oh, heavens no, no, no, no!

761
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:39,510
不是的   只是最近足不出户惯了
No, I've just been a bit housebound of late.

762
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,450
好了  可别被我摘下头巾后的样子吓到
Now, don't shriek when this scarf comes off.

763
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:46,280
伊卡璐小姐  伊卡璐染发剂形象代言  头发金黄蓬松
就快变成伊卡璐小姐了
Lady Clairol and I have become entirely too familiar.

764
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:48,480
足不出户  出什么事了吗
Housebound? You have an accident?

765
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,510
没有
No.

766
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,690
家里新添了个小孩
I had a baby.

767
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,590
小孩
A... A baby?

768
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:55,710
一个男孩
A boy.

769
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:57,400
一个儿子
A son!

770
00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:01,650
我...不  当然不是亲生儿子
Oh, I... No, I-I didn't give birth to him, of course.

771
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:03,670
不  他是...
No, he was the, um...

772
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:07,730

775
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:12,360
他们不幸死于
They died tragically

776
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,790
里士满郊外高速路的一场车祸
in a highway accident outside Richmond,

777
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:17,110
那可怜的孩子从此成了孤儿
leaving that poor little angel an orphan.

778
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:17,970
真可怕
Terrible.

779
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:20,570
的确  但小迈克尔和我
Yes, but little Michael and I

780
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:22,920
命中注定有一段母子缘

781

他注定要成为我的儿子
He was meant to be my son.

782
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:26,270
而我  成为他的母亲
And I, his mother.

783
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,560
可我受够了
And I am sick

784
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,050
自己这一副奶奶的模样
of looking like his grandmother.

785
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:34,130
好了  看你化腐朽为神奇吧
So... here. You work your magic.

786
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:43,250
海伦
Oh, Helen!

787
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:45,470
你是个货真价实的艺术家
Oh, you truly are an artist.

788
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:48,830
艺术家也要靠好胚子
Well, even an artist needs the right materials.

789
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:52,910
康丝坦斯  我认识你这么多年了
You know, Constance, in all the years I've known you,

790
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:56,740
还从没见你如此活力四射光彩照人
I don't think you have ever looked younger or more radiant.

791
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,160
一点没错  是吧
It's true, isn't it?

792
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,060
我能说几句心里话吗
May I confide something?

793
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:04,830
自孩提时代
Ever since I was a little girl,

794
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,580
我就自命不凡
I knew I was destined for great things.

795
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:11,830
觉得自己将来会名扬四海
I was gonna be somebody--

796
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:13,970
成为一个...
a person of...

797
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:16,890
伟人
significance.

798
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:20,910
我曾经以为  我会成为银幕之星
A star of the silver screen, I once thought.

799
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:25,450
但...
But...

800
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:29,480
梦想照进现实时  却成了梦魇
my dreams became nightmares.

801
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,520
闪亮的桂冠遥不可及...
Instead of laurels...

802
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,870
葬礼的花圈挥之不去
funeral wreathes.

803
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,450
荣光暗淡
Instead of glory...

804
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:42,620
寂寞生寒
...bitter disappointment,

805
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:45,310
苦痛不减
cruel afflictions.

806
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,090
现在我终于明白
Well, now I understand

807
00:48:48,770 --> 00:48:52,300
命运苦我心智
tragedy was preparing me...

808
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:55,590
必有大任降之
for something greater.

809
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:02,610
以前的种种不顺都是教训
Every loss that came before was a lesson.

810
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:06,520
是上天在锻炼我
I was being prepared.

811
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,170
而现在我终于明白目的何在
And now I know for what.

812
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:15,700
一切都为了这个孩子
This child.

813
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:20,600
一个出类拔萃的小男孩
A remarkable boy.

814
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,860
注定会成就非凡之事
Destined for greatness!

815
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,810
需要一位同样出类拔萃的母亲
In need of a remarkable mother,

816
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:34,410
一位经历挫折和逆境磨练的
someone forged in the fires of adversity...

817
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,860
人生导师...
...who can guide him...

818
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,860
来传授他智慧
...with wisdom,

819
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:46,590
赋予他坚强
with firmness,

820
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:51,230
包容他以爱
with love.

821
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:56,780
不好意思我来晚了  弗洛拉
I apologize for being so late, Flora.

822
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,080
都怪海伦非得和我唠叨
But Helen had to go into minute detail

823
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,920
她侄女的成年仪式  我都听烦了
every tiresome moment of her niece's Bat Mitzvah.

824
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:05,910
真想不到他们肯在一个13岁小孩身上
The amount of money those people

825
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:08,530
花那么多钱...
throw away on a 13-year-old is...

826
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,140
弗洛拉
Flora?

827
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:12,050
我该拿你怎么办啊
Now what am I gonna do with you?
