1
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:47,817
<i>Well, you may have never
been formally charged, doctor.</i>

2
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:50,153
<i>However, I have here
the sworn statement</i>

3
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:52,155
<i>alleging that, on occasion,</i>

4
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:54,257
<i>you have falsified
medical records.</i>

5
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,693
<i>You have withheld...</i>
Cut to Camera 1.

6
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:58,528
<i>Prescribed drugs...</i> Camera 2.

7
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:01,498
<i>From pharmacies which
you own, is that correct?</i>

8
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:03,132
I refuse to sit here

9
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:05,802
and be subjected to
these unwarranted attacks

10
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:08,338
and innuendos.

11
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:09,872
One.

12
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:12,342
<i>Well, I think the doctor's
gonna make a house call.</i>

13
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:14,211
<i>On our next program,
we will be looking</i>

14
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:15,545
<i>at the other side of the story.</i>

15
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:16,880
Matte the font.

16
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:20,204
<i>Until then, I'm Steve
Emerson. Good evening.</i>

17
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:23,953
Limo to take you to
the airport is outside.

18
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,489
Beautiful.

19
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:28,258
You got my ticket?
Would I forget?

20
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:31,127
Network wants you in L.A. for
an affiliate's meeting next week.

21
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,662
Um, your producer
wants you to do a story

22
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:35,298
on vigilante groups
in Iowa. Iowa?

23
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,766
Says there's at least two.

24
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,134
Well, you tell Jack I said no.

25
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,336
I wanna do the piece
on juvenile prisons.

26
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,128
You're not going to Atlanta
to see Linda, are you?

27
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:47,144
I'll call you on
my return flight.

28
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:57,720
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Atlanta, Georgia.</i>

29
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,945
<i>Thank you for
flying with Eastern.</i>

30
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:33,778
Steve Emerson
for Linda Coolidge.

31
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:37,215
You...

32
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:44,956
Uh, Steve Emerson to
see you, Miss Coolidge.

33
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,737
Yes, ma'am.

34
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:48,971
You can go right up.

35
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,740
Sir.

36
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:53,142
I like your show
better than<i> 60 Minutes.</i>

37
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,044
I watch it all the time.

38
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,634
Thank you very much.

39
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:08,892
Hi, how are you? Oh.
Uh... Hey, little guy.

40
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,381
Ah.

41
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:19,302
Hello.

42
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:20,936
Welcome to Atlanta.

43
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,005
Ho-ho. Very good.

44
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,677
Let me see you.

45
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:30,968
Ooh. You look dashing as ever.

46
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,486
You said you wanted
to see me very badly.

47
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,521
Here I am.

48
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:40,357
So why don't you
come and sit down?

49
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:46,696
Cheers.

50
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:52,768
Steven,

51
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:56,239
I am on to something you
are going to find very exciting.

52
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:59,164
A very hot story.

53
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,048
I see.

54
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:08,418
Is there something
wrong with that? No.

55
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:11,387
I just thought maybe you just
wanted to see me, that's all.

56
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,956
No, I do.

57
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,460
But this is an important story.

58
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:20,196
The mob is wired to
the state government

59
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,665
at the highest level.

60
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:23,966
You got any proof?

61
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,301
A snitch.

62
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,703
How good?

63
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:29,906
Oh, I checked him
out. He's connected.

64
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,630
What's in it for you?

65
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,546
We share the story.

66
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,248
We share a story.

67
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:40,583
Uh-huh.

68
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,886
I don't think so.

69
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,656
Take a look at this from
my point of view for a minute.

70
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,459
We have a messy public divorce.

71
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:51,327
I get stuck as co-anchor

72
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,095
down here at a
local station in Atlanta

73
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,398
while you stay with the network.

74
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:57,367
You even have your own show.

75
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:59,235
Steven, I want out of here.

76
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:01,259
This is my way
back to the network.

77
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,442
Please.

78
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:08,426
Oh, you know
you'll never change.

79
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:12,215
Okay.

80
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:14,439
Ah. Good.

81
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,154
Well, when do I
meet this snitch?

82
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:19,989
Tonight.

83
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:30,967
I figure we can hear the
yelling and shouting from here.

84
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:17,980
Stand up and put both
your hands on the poles.

85
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,315
Why should I?

86
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:21,339
I gotta make sure
you're not wired.

87
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,401
Okay, here's the deal.

88
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:42,939
I want $50,000 and your
promise of strict confidentiality.

89
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:46,509
I'll call you tomorrow
to find out if it's a sale.

90
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:47,743
Whoa, wait a... Wait a minute.

91
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,512
I don't even know who you are.

92
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:52,315
I've gotta have your
word you'll protect me.

93
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,417
Don't worry.

94
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:57,753
If you don't, I'm a dead man.

95
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,477
You've got my word.

96
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,659
Okay.

97
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,528
The name's Billy Ray Webber.

98
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:07,997
You can check me out.
Linda already checked you out.

99
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:10,432
She didn't give up your
name and neither will I.

100
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:12,001
Now, how good's
the stuff you've got?

101
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:13,603
I'm gonna show you the paperwork

102
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:16,205
that'll not only put some
top state government people

103
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:19,476
out of business, but a big
mob boss is gonna do time.

104
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,644
I'll check with New
York on the money

105
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,212
on two conditions.

106
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,648
Number one: if I don't like
what you've got, the deal is off...

107
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,251
Hey.
- -and second:

108
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:30,853
the next time I meet
you, it's on my turf.

109
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:33,289
I'll call you.

110
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:41,631
Mr. Emerson, can
you tell us anything...?

111
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:43,966
Can you tell us anything about
Linda Coolidge's condition?

112
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,401
What are you talking about?

113
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:48,238
Somebody shot Linda Coolidge
at her apartment this evening.

114
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:20,770
Ah, Mr. Emerson?

115
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:23,573
Mr. Emerson?

116
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:25,196
Mr... Mr. Steve Emerson?

117
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,378
That's right.

118
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,613
I'm Lieutenant
Daniels of Homicide.

119
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:32,248
I'm sorry about
Miss Coolidge, sir.

120
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:33,583
What happened?

121
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:35,985
Well, a neighbor reported
hearing a loud fight,

122
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:38,320
and then a gunshot at 10:15.

123
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,523
May I see you back
here for a second, sir?

124
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:43,692
The security guard was
notified, and he found her.

125
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:47,830
And she was dead by the
time the, uh, paramedics arrived.

126
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,320
Mr. Emerson.

127
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:52,435
I've notified Linda's family.

128
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:54,303
All right, I'll call you if
I need anything else.

129
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:55,705
What's he doing here?

130
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:56,806
Do I know you?

131
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,564
No. But we know you, don't we?

132
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,545
Who was that?

133
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:06,783
Paul Lockwood.
Businessman. Her fiancé.

134
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:09,018
Steve, what happened?
Uh, beg your pardon, sir.

135
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:11,120
I'm Lieutenant Daniels,
Homicide. Who are you?

136
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:14,757
I'm Les McCall. I own WHN.
And this is Nelson White.

137
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,325
Now, somebody
said she'd been shot.

138
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:17,460
How is she?

139
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:19,762
Miss Coolidge died
about 30 minutes ago.

140
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:20,952
Oh, no.

141
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:27,837
Mr. Emerson, you
probably don't remember,

142
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:30,142
but we met last year
at an NAB luncheon.

143
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:36,212
Anyway, I'm... I-I'm very sorry.

144
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:37,747
We all loved her.

145
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:40,716
I-I-I mean, Nelson here was...

146
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,853
Was Linda's
co-anchor at my station.

147
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:45,254
Any idea who did it?

148
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:48,157
Not yet. Uh, but
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

149
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:50,159
There's work to be done
here, so if you'll excuse me.

150
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:51,761
Let me know if there's
anything we can do.

151
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:53,362
Anything at all.

152
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:56,732
And, Steve...
Steve, give me a call.

153
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,013
You got any leads?

154
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:11,313
Not yet.

155
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,381
Any witnesses?

156
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,017
None.

157
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,185
I don't understand.
It's a security building.

158
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:18,054
How could anyone get
access into her apartment?

159
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:19,822
I don't know, but I was
thinking, Mr. Emerson,

160
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,957
that perhaps you could help
me with a couple of details.

161
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:23,526
Sure, like what?

162
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,060
According to the
security guard's log,

163
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:28,397
you entered the building
at 9:15 this evening.

164
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:29,766
That's right. So what?

165
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,301
There's no record
of you leaving.

166
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:33,903
That's because when
I went downstairs,

167
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:35,571
there were photographers
at the entrance,

168
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:36,839
so I slipped out the side door.

169
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,307
But the security guard reported

170
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:39,841
the only time he left his desk

171
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,044
was when the neighbor
reported the gunshot.

172
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:43,545
And he came up
to this apartment.

173
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:45,147
Well, he's lying.

174
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:47,616
When I went back down to
the lobby, he wasn't at his desk.

175
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,218
He certainly wouldn't
have been there

176
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:52,855
if you left after the
gunshot was fired.

177
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,424
Let me tell you something.

178
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,793
You better get some hard proof

179
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:00,696
before you make
any more accusations.

180
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,254
'Cause I don't think you
know who you're dealing with.

181
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:06,869
Mr. Emerson.

182
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,170
What?

183
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:09,638
Can you account
for your whereabouts

184
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,874
during the time of the
murder at 10:15 this evening?

185
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,943
You're damn right I
can. I was with someone.

186
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,867
Who, Mr. Emerson?

187
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:26,289
It was a privileged
communication

188
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:28,524
with a news source.
I can't tell you.

189
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:31,460
Well, if I were you, sir, I
would certainly want an alibi.

190
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:34,230
If I told you, I would be...

191
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,498
placing my source
in serious jeopardy.

192
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:37,733
I won't do that.

193
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,457
One moment, sir.

194
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,204
Mr. Emerson,

195
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,652
do you recognize that gun, sir?

196
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:05,995
It's my gun.

197
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,931
It was my gun. I gave it
to Linda some time ago.

198
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,421
Why did you give it to her?

199
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:14,002
We had a very
messy public divorce.

200
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:15,704
There are a lot of
crazies running around.

201
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:17,839
I was concerned
about her safety.

202
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:19,108
Well, I'm gonna run that gun

203
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,509
through ballistics
tests tonight,

204
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,912
because it's been
recently fired.

205
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:25,581
Do you have an attorney, sir?

206
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:28,272
Why, you placing
me under arrest?

207
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:35,158
Mr. Emerson, one of my
men just found this gun

208
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:36,980
in your car, sir.

209
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:48,326
Morning, ladies.

210
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:53,609
Good morning, ladies.

211
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:56,745
Good morning. You're all
looking well this morning.

212
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,247
Easy.

213
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:00,983
Easy does it, now.

214
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:04,853
Look at this as part
of life's food chain.

215
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:08,157
All right, look at
it as my breakfast.

216
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:12,161
<i>Police arrested
Emerson late last night,</i>

217
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:16,199
<i>and he was released on
$500,000 bail this morning.</i>

218
00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:18,867
<i>Emerson was
unavailable for comment.</i>

219
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:22,972
<i>Updating the national
news: in Washington today,</i>

220
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:26,309
<i>with major pieces of business
left on the senate's calendar,</i>

221
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,143

faced with a choice</i>

222
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,413

223
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:43,859
Hello?

224
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,028
I don't know how it
is there in Atlanta,

225
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,497
but here in Willow
Springs the sun's shining,

226
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:50,065
children are
playing in the creek

227
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,702
and honest folk are
getting ready to go to work.

228
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:56,272
Sometimes I wish
I was an orphan.

229
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,292
<i>I said, honest folk are
getting ready to go to work.</i>

230
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:20,195
Okay, okay, okay. Heh.

231
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,174
So, ladies and
gentlemen of the jury,

232
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:34,576
the people's evidence
has overwhelmingly shown

233
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,081
that this defendant also had
a motive to kill the decedent

234
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,951
and had full access
to his warehouse.

235
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:44,620
These facts, beyond
a reasonable doubt,

236
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:46,555
compel you to deliver a verdict

237
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:49,258
of guilty of murder
in the first degree.

238
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,126
Thank you.

239
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,328
Thank you, Your Honor.

240
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:53,484
Mr. Matlock.

241
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,401
Members of the jury,

242
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,703
I know we'd all like
to get out of here

243
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:04,373
and go someplace where the
air conditioning actually works,

244
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:07,109
so I'm gonna be brief.

245
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:12,614
Now, I've got to be fair
and recognize, as do you,

246
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,518
that the prosecution
has collected

247
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:19,421
a lot of circumstantial
evidence.

248
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,657
But the problem is,

249
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:24,960
it is all circumstantial.

250
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,063
Now, they've accused
this man of murder.

251
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,833
But no one saw the crime occur.

252
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:33,535
No body has ever been found.

253
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:37,139
No one knows how the
victim died, or if he died at all.

254
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:44,013
In fact, they have never proved
a crime was actually committed.

255
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:50,552
And now, I'm gonna count to ten.

256
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:54,756
And when I'm done,
this supposed victim's

257
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,147
gonna walk through
that door over there.

258
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:01,953
One.

259
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:05,367
Two.

260
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,224
Three.

261
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,760
Four.

262
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:11,962
Five.

263
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:13,976
Six.

264
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,299
Seven.

265
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:17,880
Eight.

266
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:19,748
Nine.

267
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,172
Ten.

268
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:37,800
So you see, members of the jury,

269
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:43,505
in fairness, you must
return a verdict of not guilty.

270
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:47,910
Each and every one of
you was staring at that door

271
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:50,713
because you had
a reasonable doubt

272
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:54,016
that a crime was even committed.

273
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,852
And you must let
this man go free.

274
00:17:56,876 --> 00:18:00,444
He was staring at that
door as hard as you were.

275
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:03,159
And so were they.

276
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:11,634
Your Honor, the law is
quite clear on tenants' rights,

277
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:14,069
and I respectfully ask
you to order the landlord

278
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,005
to return my client's
security deposit

279
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:18,874
in the amount of $750.

280
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:20,375
Thank you, counselor.

281
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:21,643
If there's nothing further,

282
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:25,781
I will take the matter
under submission.

283
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:28,751
We'll receive his decision
by mail in a couple of weeks.

284
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:29,874
I'll let you know.

285
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:33,722
<i>I'll tell you the thing
about Clarence.</i>

286
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:35,324
<i>When you left his stand,</i>

287
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:37,459
you knew you'd
gotten a shoeshine.

288
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,795
I mean, the man was an artist.

289
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:42,197
Yep. They don't make
'em like him anymore.

290
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:45,067
No. And I for one
am gonna miss him.

291
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:46,501
Hi. Hi.

292
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:47,736
Morning. Morning, Bert.

293
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,271
See you, Bert. See you.

294
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,739
How'd it go?

295
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,274
I got an acquittal.

296
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,675
Jury wasn't out long.

297
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:56,779
Well, justice was
swift this morning.

298
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,781
Let me ask you something. What?

299
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,816
Did it ever occur to
you that we could be

300
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,251
the best father and daughter
team to try a criminal case

301
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,309
here in Atlanta?

302
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:07,255
No, it didn't.

303
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,924
Hi, Phil. PHIL: Hi, Charlene.

304
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:12,027
Which is my way of
saying, I think that I'm ready

305
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:13,929
for a little more
challenging litigation.

306
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:17,165
Charlene, you've only
been out of law school

307
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,601
one year. Two.

308
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,202
Well. Hi, John.

309
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:21,569
Hi. And where am I gonna get

310
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,505
better on-the-job
training than with you,

311
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:24,740
Dad? Hm.

312
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:28,744
Hey, Wayne, you
are looking good.

313
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:31,013
Who are all these fellas?

314
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:32,715
Lawyers.

315
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:34,316
Stay away from lawyers.

316
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,451
They have ethics, no morals.

317
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:39,321
Yeah, but they sure do have fun.

318
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:43,325
Where'd you meet 'em?
Met most of 'em at Santino's.

319
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,960
That's a pickup bar, isn't it?

320
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:46,028
No.

321
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:48,864
It's where we
yuppies go to unwind.

322
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:51,633
Haven't you ever seen
a beer commercial?

323
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:53,068
Hmph.

324
00:19:57,263 --> 00:19:59,107
Bob, how's that new car running?

325
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:00,442
Running good, Ben.

326
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:02,378
Good-looking car.

327
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:04,579
Paid way too much for it.

328
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:06,949
Harvey Ravanelle's
looking for you, Ben.

329
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:09,684
What's an important
lawyer like Harvey Ravanelle

330
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,228
want with the likes of me?

331
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:13,722
Morning, Hazel.

332
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:14,723
Hi, Hazel. HAZEL: Hi.

333
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:16,391
Phones messages
are on your desk,

334
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,627
Charlene's lunch date
has been cancelled,

335
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:20,529
Mr. and Mrs. Pearson
are in your office,

336
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:23,198
and you forgot to
file your tax form.

337
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,456
Damn. I filed it for you.

338
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:29,371
Hazel, sometime let's
you and me get married.

339
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,273
Get a new suit
and I'll think about it.

340
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:33,475
I'm sorry to keep
you folks waiting.

341
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:35,911
Charlene, this is Mark
and Betty Pearson.

342
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:38,146
Mark has milk cattle
over at Willow Springs.

343
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,083
This is my associate and my
daughter. What can I do for you?

344
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:44,053
Old man Cornell
said my dog bit him.

345
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:46,521
Says he's gonna sue us in court.

346
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:48,157
Is that a fact?

347
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:53,828
Well, we've got four
lines of defenses.

348
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:56,232
One: my dog doesn't bite.

349
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:59,501
Two: my dog was
tied up at the time.

350
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:03,939
Three: I don't think
you really got bit.

351
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:06,697
Four: I don't have a dog.

352
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:09,445
My dog don't bite.

353
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:15,005
Yes, ma'am.

354
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:18,175
Really?

355
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:20,889
I'll be right with him.

356
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:23,625
If you'll just go with
my associate here,

357
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:25,760
she'll draft a
strongly worded letter

358
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:29,364
to disabuse Mr. Cornell
of this fruitless litigation.

359
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:31,833
Is it gonna be expensive?

360
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:35,170
Well, her time is
not as dear as mine.

361
00:21:35,194 --> 00:21:37,472
So it's gonna cost you $15.

362
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:41,442
That's 10 for the letter and
5 for a leash for you dog.

363
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,211
And then I am taking
you out to lunch

364
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:45,180
so we can discuss our future.

365
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:46,848
I plan on being unavailable.

366
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:48,283
Harvey!

367
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,885
Sorry to drop in on
you like this, Benny.

368
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:51,319
Aw, it's a real honor,

369
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,522
your coming all the way
down from your penthouse.

370
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:55,524
I'm Ben Matlock. Steve Emerson.

371
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:57,592
Oh, I know my
mother's gonna be green

372
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:59,027
when she hears I met you.

373
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:02,431
Ben, our firm represents
Steve's network in this state,

374
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:03,698
but as you probably know,

375
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:05,767
Steve here needs a
top defense attorney.

376
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,169
It's all anybody
could talk about

377
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:09,538
down at the courthouse this
morning. Sit down, Mr. Emerson.

378
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:11,005
Know any of the details, Ben?

379
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:13,775
Friend of mine in the
DA's office told me about it.

380
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,510
Help yourself to peanuts.

381
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:19,381
I got 'em in barter from
a client down in Plains.

382
00:22:19,405 --> 00:22:20,716
It's not who you think.

383
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:24,019
Look, Harvey, with all
due respect to Mr. Matlock,

384
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:25,721
I have some very close
friends in New York,

385
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:27,523
and they're excellent
defense attorneys.

386
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:30,492
I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

387
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:32,428
Why is that?

388
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:34,896
Well, let me explain
some of your problems.

389
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,533
First off, you got the
disposition of the jury

390
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:38,867
to consider.

391
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:41,770
They look at you as a
fast-talking TV personality

392
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:43,071
from New York.

393
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:45,040
And you're rich.
I'm hardly rich.

394
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:48,310
According to the standards of
folks around here, you're rich.

395
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:52,147
And you got another first strike
against you: you're an outsider.

396
00:22:52,171 --> 00:22:54,649
You need a local boy,
somebody who's good.

397
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:56,184
Steve,

398
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,087
Ben here has a
record in criminal cases

399
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:00,722
probably second to none.

400
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:03,125
He's handled murder
trials all over the country.

401
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:05,727
Harvey, don't...
Don't press the man.

402
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:07,896
Harvey, I'm in
deep trouble here.

403
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,040
If I were in your
spot, I'd want Ben.

404
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:13,068
Wait a minute.

405
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:15,770
I said you need
somebody<i> like</i> me.

406
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:17,773
I didn't say I'd take the case.

407
00:23:17,797 --> 00:23:19,074
What?

408
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:21,076
Your situation doesn't
sound too good to me.

409
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,478
Ben, we need you.

410
00:23:22,502 --> 00:23:24,713
Harvey, I've got my
reputation to consider.

411
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,615
Money is no object here.

412
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:28,872
Money never is.

413
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:31,954
How much cash you got?

414
00:23:31,978 --> 00:23:36,125
About 50,000. Any
bonds? Securities?

415
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:37,314
Another 50.

416
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:40,596
That'll do as a retainer.

417
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,031
A retainer?

418
00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:44,699
Look, at it this way, Steve.

419
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:47,402
If I win, it'll be worth it.

420
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,337
If I don't, they take you

421
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:52,107
to the Georgia Diagnostic
and Classification Center

422
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:54,209
over near Jackson and
they electrocute you.

423
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:56,353
I think you made
your point, okay?

424
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:59,514
Harvey,

425
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:01,583
thanks for throwing
some business my way.

426
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:02,684
I appreciate it.

427
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:04,675
I'll talk to you later, Steve.

428
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:08,590
We got a lot of talking to do.

429
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:12,026
You gotta tell me everything
that happened that night,

430
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:15,563
anything important
I should know.

431
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:18,299
Well, my marriage
to Linda was stormy.

432
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:21,469
The divorce was even worse.

433
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:23,927
But I loved her.
I didn't kill her.

434
00:24:25,531 --> 00:24:28,443
I understand you've got an
alibi for the time of the murder.

435
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,278
That's a privileged
news communication.

436
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,713
I can't reveal the source.

437
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:33,582
Even if it means your own neck?

438
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:35,238
I gave the man my word.

439
00:24:37,343 --> 00:24:40,122
I don't have to tell you this
is gonna be an uphill battle.

440
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:43,458
Prosecution has all the cards.

441
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,682
I'll give it the
best shot I got.

442
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,899
Next to injustice,
I hate losing.

443
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:58,328
Thank you.

444
00:25:02,802 --> 00:25:05,280
Ben, Hazel said you wanted
me here for the arraignment.

445
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:07,404
This is Steve Emerson.

446
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:13,109
My daughter, Charlene, will
be associate counsel on this.

447
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:15,390
How do you do?

448
00:25:15,414 --> 00:25:20,028
I am so pleased to be working
on your case, Mr. Emerson.

449
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:21,396
I'm delighted also.

450
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:24,232
You're Ben Matlock, right?

451
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:26,267
Yes, sir. I've heard
a lot about you.

452
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:29,538
Burton Hawkins. I'll be
prosecuting this case.

453
00:25:29,562 --> 00:25:31,828
Can we talk, please?

454
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:39,348
First of all, I don't wanna
cut any deals on this one.

455
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:42,050
I'm asking for murder one.

456
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:44,318
What else? "Else"?!

457
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:46,387
What are you...?
You said, "First of all."

458
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:48,089
What's second?

459
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:49,758
Aha.

460
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:51,092
How soon can we try this case?

461
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:53,228
Soon as you like.

462
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:55,931
<i>"People of the State of
Georgia v. Steve Emerson."</i>

463
00:25:55,955 --> 00:26:00,068
Case number F81-500.

464
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:02,504
Benjamin Matlock for
the defense, Your Honor.

465
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:04,673
All right. MATLOCK:
Defendant is present.

466
00:26:04,697 --> 00:26:05,874
He's been informed

467
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:08,209
of his constitutional
and statutory rights,

468
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,511
received a copy
of the indictment,

469
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:13,482
waives further reading thereof.

470
00:26:13,506 --> 00:26:15,249
Defendant pleads
not guilty, Your Honor,

471
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:17,019
requests a jury trial.

472
00:26:17,043 --> 00:26:18,653
The time is waived.

473
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:21,189
What about, uh, September 16th?

474
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:23,925
Fine with my client.

475
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:25,493
Prosecution agrees.

476
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:29,264
All right, this case is set
for trial on September 16th,

477
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:33,468
Courtroom 203 of the Criminal
Division of Superior Court,

478
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:35,137
9 a.m.

479
00:26:35,161 --> 00:26:38,540
Mr. Emerson, is it true you're
protecting a news source?

480
00:26:38,564 --> 00:26:40,008
Why were you here in Atlanta?

481
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:42,210
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

482
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:43,878
I can only answer
one question at a time.

483
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:45,780
Mr. Emerson has no comment.

484
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:47,882
What's your strategy?
Did he have an alibi?

485
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:50,018
Hold it, hold it.

486
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:51,452
All I'll say is,

487
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:54,989
the State has seen fit to assign
their most brilliant prosecutor,

488
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:56,691
Burton Hawkins, to this trial.

489
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:59,360
Now, they don't assign a
man like "Death Row" Hawkins

490
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:02,163
unless they feel they got a
lot of problems with their case.

491
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:03,865
And they may have
a couple of problems

492
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:05,333
they don't know about yet.

493
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:06,968
That's all. Thank you.

494
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:12,607
They're your batteries,
boys. That's all.

495
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,577
Step into my office. Come on.

496
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:17,311
Now, this is important.

497
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:20,148
I don't want you making
any statements to the press.

498
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:21,716
Absolutely none. Why is that?

499
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,852
I don't want this
case tried on TV

500
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:25,954
before we get it
in the courtroom.

501
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:28,089
All right. What about
this prosecutor?

502
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:29,758
How good is he? I don't
know much about him.

503
00:27:29,782 --> 00:27:31,525
He's sorta new. But
he must be good,

504
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:32,894
or he wouldn't be on this case.

505
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:35,163
Oh, he's good. He's got
a great conviction rate.

506
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:38,855
DA's office thinks
that he's a real comer.

507
00:27:41,894 --> 00:27:44,094
It's all right. She's a lawyer.

508
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:47,309
What happens now?

509
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,811
I spoke with a friend of
mine who should know.

510
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,280
And he hasn't heard
anything about the syndicate

511
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:53,949
being involved in
state government.

512
00:27:53,973 --> 00:27:55,583
So I've gotta find the
man you were with

513
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:57,752
the night of the
murder, and fast.

514
00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:59,254
Charlene here's gonna check out

515
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:01,156
the other people in
Miss Coolidge's life,

516
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,791
see who might have had a motive.

517
00:28:02,815 --> 00:28:04,526
That's something I'd
like to work on myself.

518
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:07,628
I want you to stay in your hotel
room and shut off the phone.

519
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:09,464
Wait a minute. I'm an
investigative reporter.

520
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:10,898
I'm not gonna sit
in a hotel room.

521
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:12,400
Right now what you are

522
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:15,203
is a reporter facing
the electric chair.

523
00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:18,473
Now, you'll do as I say,
or I won't represent you.

524
00:28:18,497 --> 00:28:19,697
It's as simple as that.

525
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:26,514
Okay.

526
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,505
I'll be at the hotel.

527
00:28:32,812 --> 00:28:34,444
Ben.

528
00:28:37,483 --> 00:28:38,493
Thanks.

529
00:28:39,819 --> 00:28:40,795
Let's earn our money.

530
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:41,952
Okay.

531
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:47,123
Um, it's okay. I'm a lawyer.

532
00:28:53,532 --> 00:28:55,676
What say, Tyler, a little lunch?

533
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,978
Absolutely.

534
00:28:57,002 --> 00:28:58,647
Ben, take my advice

535
00:28:58,671 --> 00:29:00,782
and stay away from
the commodities market.

536
00:29:00,806 --> 00:29:03,552
I hear there's a big
soybean crop coming.

537
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:06,821
What's the difference? I
don't have the cash anyway.

538
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:09,691
You know, that's a
real shame, Tyler.

539
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:12,160
I know how bad you
wanna go to California,

540
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:13,662
live that easy life.

541
00:29:13,686 --> 00:29:17,766
All those fine-looking
clothes, beautiful women,

542
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:20,201
fancy food with
the avocados in it.

543
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:22,737
You could sure do
yourself some good

544
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,940
selling soybean short.

545
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:28,799
I might be able to
invest you a little money.

546
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:34,682
Now, see, I knew that this
lunch was not about lunch.

547
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:37,551
Now, Ben, you got me out
of some serious trouble once

548
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:39,654
and I will be
eternally grateful.

549
00:29:39,678 --> 00:29:41,723
Look in my eye.

550
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:43,157
You see the gratitude there?

551
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,993
But I am not doing any more
private investigative work.

552
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:48,997
Tyler, all I wanted to do is
advance you a little money.

553
00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:51,632
I'm not doing any more PI work.

554
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:53,334
I happen to have
a check right here.

555
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:54,903
I'm out of that game.

556
00:29:54,927 --> 00:29:57,839
See the check?

557
00:29:57,863 --> 00:29:59,975
What's the case?

558
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:02,043
Linda Coolidge
was laid to rest today

559
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:04,045
in her hometown
of Utica, New York.

560
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:05,513
There were no services,

561
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:08,549
and only her mother and her
sister were at the gravesite,

562
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:11,219
which is the way Linda
would have wanted it.

563
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:14,455
She was, at heart, a
very private person.

564
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:17,180
It's hard to believe she's gone.

565
00:30:18,717 --> 00:30:21,529
We'll be right back with
Dr. Farnsworth and the weather,

566
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:24,520
and Bill Tucker
with sports after this.

567
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:26,623
Touching tribute.

568
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,671
You didn't like her?

569
00:30:29,695 --> 00:30:32,361
Oh, I did. But he didn't.

570
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:35,776
Ultimately.

571
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,880
Excuse me.

572
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:40,415
Mr. White? Yes?

573
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:42,284
Hi, I'm Charlene Matlock.

574
00:30:42,308 --> 00:30:45,220
Our firm is handling
Steve Emerson's defense.

575
00:30:45,244 --> 00:30:48,022
I was wondering if I could
ask you a few questions

576
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:49,624
about Linda Coolidge.

577
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:51,592
Is there somewhere
we could go talk?

578
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:52,994
I-I'm very sorry. I...

579
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:54,617
I don't have time right now.

580
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:58,766
Could I make an appointment?

581
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:01,035
Look, I'm sorry, but
my attorney told me

582
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:03,304
not to get involved with this.

583
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:04,805
Besides,

584
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:07,475
I don't know anything
about Linda's personal life.

585
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:11,246
Sorry.

586
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:24,559
It's Steve Emerson down
in Atlanta. Is Jimmy in?

587
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:26,694
Jimmy, I need you to express
me Linda's banking records

588
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,930
first thing in the
morning, okay?

589
00:31:28,954 --> 00:31:30,365
Now, look, spare
me the legalities.

590
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:32,400
You've been our accountant
what? Eight, nine years?

591
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:33,735
Well, you'll stay my accountant

592
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:36,637
if you give me
those computer runs.

593
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:38,173
What are you doing here?

594
00:31:38,197 --> 00:31:40,641
Same thing you're doing,
only I'm supposed to be here.

595
00:31:43,936 --> 00:31:45,246
Phil.

596
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,381
Listen, I need all the clips

597
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:47,949
out of Research
you have on Linda.

598
00:31:47,973 --> 00:31:49,918
Particularly anything
out of Atlanta,

599
00:31:49,942 --> 00:31:51,987
with a heavy underline
on the social stuff.

600
00:31:52,011 --> 00:31:55,044
I'm gonna call you back
tomorrow, okay? Thanks.

601
00:31:56,215 --> 00:31:59,094
Ben isn't gonna like this.

602
00:31:59,118 --> 00:32:02,130
Well, Ben isn't gonna
be electrocuted, is he?

603
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:04,032
Steve, I, uh...

604
00:32:04,056 --> 00:32:06,001
I got those tapes up
you wanted to see.

605
00:32:06,025 --> 00:32:08,069
Great.

606
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:09,270
You coming?

607
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:10,627
Oh, yeah.

608
00:32:13,132 --> 00:32:14,942
You wanna run that tape, please?

609
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:17,812
Roll the A machine, please.

610
00:32:17,836 --> 00:32:19,180
What are you looking for?

611
00:32:19,204 --> 00:32:21,783
A clue to whoever
put that gun in my car.

612
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:22,918
Oh, listen, I, uh,

613
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:25,687
ordered up some additional
footage from WPKS.

614
00:32:25,711 --> 00:32:26,988
What have you got?

615
00:32:27,012 --> 00:32:29,124
Her boyfriend. Uh,
uh, what's his name?

616
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:30,691
Lockwood. Lockwood. Yeah, yeah.

617
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:33,028
Well, he claims he
was at a fundraiser.

618
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:34,985
Let's see if he's
telling the truth.

619
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:38,800
Roll the B machine, please.

620
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:40,635
You suspect Lockwood?

621
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:43,071
Hey, listen, at this point
I suspect everybody.

622
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:45,506
He told the police he
never left the ballroom.

623
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,642
Well, looks like his
alibi is better than mine.

624
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:50,144
Yeah.

625
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:51,378
Okay, listen, Steve,

626
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:53,648
if you need anything,
let me know, huh?

627
00:32:53,672 --> 00:32:55,382
Morris, switch
back to the first tape.

628
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:57,886
Roll the A machine
again, please.

629
00:32:58,243 --> 00:32:59,487
You might wanna find out

630
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:01,789
where her fellow
anchorman was that night.

631
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,190
Nelson White?

632
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:04,659
And what about helpful McCall?

633
00:33:04,683 --> 00:33:07,629
Why is he sticking
his neck out for you?

634
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:11,198
Maybe he thinks
I'm a terrific guy.

635
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:14,201
I already asked him. He
said he was home, alone.

636
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:16,070
Thought he was married.

637
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:19,107
Separated. Where do you want
to have dinner tomorrow night?

638
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:21,109
I didn't know that we were

639
00:33:21,133 --> 00:33:23,244
having dinner together
tomorrow night.

640
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:25,814
I thought you wanted a
full background on Linda.

641
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:27,448
I do.

642
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:31,119
Have dinner in my hotel
dining room around 8.

643
00:33:31,143 --> 00:33:32,453
It's for you.

644
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:34,837
I'll take that in
Linda's dressing room.

645
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,127
Gonna tell Daddy on me?

646
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,227
Absolutely.

647
00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:04,418
Which one of you
is the toughest?

648
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:07,121
What's it to you?

649
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:09,256
Here's a ten spot.

650
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,325
I come out and my car
hasn't been touched,

651
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:13,461
there'll be another
one just like it.

652
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:15,284
You got it.

653
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:23,771
<i>♪ You always took The last ♪</i>

654
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:27,975
<i>♪ Of my pride ♪</i>

655
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:32,447
<i>♪ I realized ♪</i>

656
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:35,016
<i>♪ You hate goodbye ♪</i>

657
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,217
Yeah?

658
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,853
Ben, now this is
exactly the reason

659
00:34:38,877 --> 00:34:41,022
why I don't like
investigative work.

660
00:34:41,046 --> 00:34:43,625
Take a look around here.

661
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:46,027
One: this is the kind of place

662
00:34:46,051 --> 00:34:48,029
where you can catch
death like a cold.

663
00:34:48,053 --> 00:34:51,099
And I assume there's a
powerful reason why we're here.

664
00:34:51,123 --> 00:34:53,201
Two:

665
00:34:53,225 --> 00:34:55,603
you never know when
one of these yahoos

666
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:57,439
is gonna get it in his
skull to mess with you.

667
00:34:57,463 --> 00:35:00,108
Tyler, why are we here?

668
00:35:00,132 --> 00:35:01,342
All right.

669
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:03,411
I put the word out
to some people

670
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:07,481
that we are looking for
a very special songbird.

671
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:09,483
I got a message on
my answering machine

672
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:12,887
that said if we came
here, we'd meet somebody.

673
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:16,457
You think the person we're
looking for could be here now?

674
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:18,760
Well, either that,

675
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:21,351
or they sent someone
to scout us out first.

676
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,989
You girls lost?

677
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:31,939
You see what I
mean? It never fails.

678
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,075
I asked you a question, Leroy.

679
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:35,676
Of course you realize

680
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:39,047
that because of this scholar,
we have blown our meeting.

681
00:35:39,071 --> 00:35:40,837
No one's gonna talk to us now.

682
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,487
Let's you and me get it on, son.

683
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:48,622
You know, friend? You're
right. You made your point.

684
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:49,857
We're leaving. Excuse us.

685
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:52,581
You ain't going...

686
00:35:55,754 --> 00:35:57,787
Damn, I hate this business.

687
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,938
Ladies and gentlemen,

688
00:36:03,962 --> 00:36:06,473
you have just seen
a demonstration

689
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,710
of what can be done
if you're accosted

690
00:36:08,734 --> 00:36:10,344
as my friend here was.

691
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,847
But what if you're
not an ex-Marine?

692
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:15,516
What if you're the one
to suffer bodily harm?

693
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,019
The smartest thing you
can do is come to see me.

694
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:21,488
Benjamin Matlock, fully
licensed attorney at law.

695
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:26,093
Your personal injuries
can be worth big money.

696
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:27,761
Night, all.

697
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:33,122
<i>♪ You hate goodbye ♪</i>

698
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:45,880
Well, as far as Linda's
co-workers are concerned,

699
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:49,383
I think that we should take a
closer look at McCall and White.

700
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:51,552
Why don't you nose
around the TV station?

701
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:53,855
The weatherman loves to talk.

702
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:56,123
Hm. The last time I
listened to that sucker

703
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:57,859
I got rained on at the beach.

704
00:36:57,883 --> 00:36:59,694
I'll see you all in the morning.

705
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:01,462
Where's Emerson?

706
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:03,431
He was at the TV station
yesterday afternoon.

707
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:05,733
Doing what? Some investigating.

708
00:37:05,757 --> 00:37:07,535
I told him to stay out of sight.

709
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,169
Well, actually,

710
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:11,105
I was rather impressed
with what he was doing.

711
00:37:11,129 --> 00:37:13,074
He was getting Linda's
financial records,

712
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:15,243
going over news footage
of the murder scene.

713
00:37:15,267 --> 00:37:16,778
You were?

714
00:37:16,802 --> 00:37:17,812
Were what?

715
00:37:17,836 --> 00:37:19,080
Impressed?

716
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:20,448
Yes, I was.

717
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:24,084
Were you impressed when
I told him stay at his hotel?

718
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:26,287
Did you consider I might
have had a reason for that?

719
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:28,022
Well, he was getting results.

720
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:29,857
I saw no point in stopping him.

721
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:31,125
Charlene, one of the reasons

722
00:37:31,149 --> 00:37:33,061
I charge my clients
so much money

723
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:34,995
is so they'll do
what I tell 'em.

724
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:36,930
This man is a
target for the press.

725
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:39,100
We can get that
same information.

726
00:37:39,124 --> 00:37:40,468
When are you seeing him again?

727
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:41,769
We're meeting in the dining room

728
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:43,070
at his hotel tonight

729
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,206
so I can get some
background on Linda Coolidge.

730
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,696
You find him attractive.

731
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,444
So does most of America.

732
00:37:49,468 --> 00:37:50,967
You're his lawyer.

733
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:54,415
Are you insinuating

734
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,350
that I might let any
personal feelings

735
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:57,818
I have about a client

736
00:37:57,842 --> 00:37:59,954
interfere with my
professional relationship?

737
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:02,123
I haven't said anything.

738
00:38:02,147 --> 00:38:03,157
Yet.

739
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:04,613
Good.

740
00:38:06,351 --> 00:38:08,729
Any luck getting in to
see the boyfriend? Um...?

741
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:10,731
Lockwood. Yeah.

742
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:13,434
No. He wouldn't
return my phone calls.

743
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:16,292
So I... made an appointment
under another name.

744
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:18,539
That's very devious.

745
00:38:18,563 --> 00:38:20,841
Yes, I thought
you might approve.

746
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:22,610
I'll see you later. Yeah.

747
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,515
Yes, ma'am?

748
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:28,649
Put him on.

749
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:32,642
Speaking.

750
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:36,980
I'll meet you anywhere you say.

751
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,583
Right. I'll be there.

752
00:38:56,401 --> 00:38:57,911
This is ridiculous.

753
00:38:57,935 --> 00:39:00,281
How can they
treat you like that?

754
00:39:00,305 --> 00:39:02,182
Beg pardon? I'm amazed.

755
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:03,451
You are?

756
00:39:03,475 --> 00:39:06,787
I am astounded that a
scientist of your stature

757
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:08,156
is forced to dress like that.

758
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,858
What, do they want you
to look like good weather?

759
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:11,959
Who are you?

760
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:13,994
I'm Tyler Hudson,
Dr. Farnsworth.

761
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,497
I've been a fan of yours
since you were on radio,

762
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,466
doing forecasts out
there at the airport.

763
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:20,601
I never missed your show.

764
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:21,902
If I don't go along,

765
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:23,937
they'll get some kid
in here to replace me.

766
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:25,706
Mm. Uh, you work here?

767
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,207
No, no. I work for
a couple of lawyers.

768
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:30,944
But look, I am such a fan.

769
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:32,680
Could I buy you a cup of coffee?

770
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:35,783
I saw this fantastic
little sidewalk cafe

771
00:39:35,807 --> 00:39:37,585
around the corner.
It would be great.

772
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:39,320
If it doesn't rain.

773
00:39:39,344 --> 00:39:40,821
Trust me.

774
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:43,779
For old time's sake.

775
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:47,029
Mr. Lockwood.

776
00:39:49,488 --> 00:39:50,931
Mr. Lockwood?

777
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:52,233
Yes?

778
00:39:52,257 --> 00:39:55,603
Uh, you have a 2:00
appointment with Miss Henderson.

779
00:39:55,627 --> 00:39:57,371
Oh, yes.

780
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:00,307
Well, that's me.

781
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:02,977
Actually, I'm Charlene Matlock.

782
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:04,745
I'm sorry about the deception,

783
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:06,380
but you wouldn't
return my phone calls.

784
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,048
If you think for one moment

785
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,349
that I'm gonna help the man

786
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:12,152
who killed my
fiancée, you're crazy.

787
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:13,521
Mr. Lockwood, uh,

788
00:40:13,545 --> 00:40:16,156
I-I know how upset you must be.

789
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:19,927
Upset? We were to be
married in three weeks.

790
00:40:19,951 --> 00:40:23,598
W-wouldn't you like to
be certain who killed her?

791
00:40:23,622 --> 00:40:25,566
You're telling me
that Emerson didn't?

792
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,067
That's right, I am.

793
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,470
Now I know it's our
job to defend him,

794
00:40:29,494 --> 00:40:31,205
but I happen to think
that he's innocent.

795
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:32,673
And wouldn't you
like to be certain

796
00:40:32,697 --> 00:40:35,943
that the right man is convicted?
Isn't that important to you?

797
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:38,746
I really don't see how
I can be of any help.

798
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,181
Maybe you can't.

799
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:43,017
But what if you know something?

800
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:45,185
Something that you
may think is insignificant,

801
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:48,089
that might help us find
out who really did kill her?

802
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:49,690
You really believe
him, don't you?

803
00:40:49,714 --> 00:40:51,425
Yes, I do.

804
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,027
Well, I'm sorry to hear that,

805
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:55,029
because Linda told
me all about him

806
00:40:55,053 --> 00:40:56,664
and I think he's
going to be convicted

807
00:40:56,688 --> 00:40:58,432
because he killed her.

808
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,623
Excuse me.

809
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,767
You got the time?

810
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:17,907
Twenty-five after 3.

811
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,688
This is your
business card, isn't it?

812
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:23,712
That it is.

813
00:41:25,383 --> 00:41:28,062
I was about to give up on you.

814
00:41:28,086 --> 00:41:31,232
Well, I had to make
sure you were alone.

815
00:41:31,256 --> 00:41:33,868
Well, you're
right to be careful.

816
00:41:33,892 --> 00:41:35,569
Your friend must be real nervous

817
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:37,538
considering what happened.

818
00:41:37,562 --> 00:41:41,242
Afraid now Emerson will
talk to save his own skin.

819
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:42,509
Will he?

820
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:44,778
It's hard to say.

821
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:46,947
But with all these
newspeople chasing this story

822
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:49,517
somebody could find
out about your friend.

823
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:51,986
He'd be left hung out to dry.

824
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,788
Can you do anything for him?

825
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:55,856
Maybe.

826
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,025
Like what?

827
00:41:58,049 --> 00:42:01,027
Tell him to call me tonight.

828
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:02,897
I'll have a proposition for him.

829
00:42:02,921 --> 00:42:04,787
I'll tell him.

830
00:42:13,765 --> 00:42:16,343
Hi. Hi. Sorry I'm late.

831
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,411
It's okay.

832
00:42:17,435 --> 00:42:19,480
You look great.

833
00:42:19,504 --> 00:42:21,516
Thank you.

834
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,050
A cocktail, ma'am?

835
00:42:23,074 --> 00:42:25,707
Um, any diet drink.

836
00:42:27,846 --> 00:42:29,223
I have no style.

837
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:31,358
Or maybe I have too much style.

838
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:34,294
I guess it all depends
on your point of view.

839
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:35,829
What is your point of view?

840
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:37,198
About what?

841
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:39,099
Me.

842
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:41,902
Well, we're not
supposed to be concerned

843
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:43,459
with your innocence or guilt.

844
00:42:45,196 --> 00:42:46,496
But I think you're innocent.

845
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,111
What about your father?

846
00:42:50,135 --> 00:42:51,412
My father.

847
00:42:51,436 --> 00:42:55,115
My father would not say,
no matter what he thought.

848
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:58,419
Well, he really works that
simple country-boy routine, huh?

849
00:42:58,443 --> 00:42:59,886
Well, he is a country boy.

850
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,777
He's just not simple.

851
00:43:04,783 --> 00:43:06,259
Uh, we're from the<i>
National Informer.</i>

852
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:07,628
Come on, get out of here.

853
00:43:07,652 --> 00:43:10,264
Do you usually have candlelit
dinners with your attorneys?

854
00:43:10,288 --> 00:43:11,499
Look, get lost, okay?

855
00:43:11,523 --> 00:43:14,490
Are you and Miss Matlock
something of an item here?

856
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:20,674
Steve, come on.
Come on, come on.

857
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:21,978
Come on, let's go.

858
00:43:30,642 --> 00:43:33,487
<i>Mr. Hawkins, what can you
tell us about the Emerson case?</i>

859
00:43:33,511 --> 00:43:35,789
<i>Well, naturally,
Nelson, I can't discuss</i>

860
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:37,824
<i>any of the issues that
might be prejudicial.</i>

861
00:43:37,848 --> 00:43:40,728
<i>But I do think that it raises
questions about the media.</i>

862
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:44,231
<i>- How's that?
- Well, for one thing...</i>

863
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:46,567
Hello.

864
00:43:46,591 --> 00:43:48,168
Ahem. Well, Mama,

865
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:52,406
I-I hope nothing's wrong,
'cause I can't come by tonight.

866
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:54,808
Well, I'm working real hard

867
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:57,678
trying to keep Steve
Emerson out of prison.

868
00:43:57,702 --> 00:44:00,080
Charlene's working hard too.

869
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:01,804
She's doing a good job.

870
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:06,620
All right. You get a
good night's sleep now.

871
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:07,644
Night, Mama.

872
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:11,158
Okay.

873
00:44:11,182 --> 00:44:12,626
What's that?

874
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,862
Bologna sandwich.

875
00:44:14,886 --> 00:44:16,251
Chicken bologna.

876
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:18,165
Taste like bologna?

877
00:44:18,189 --> 00:44:19,922
Less fat.

878
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:23,504
Hm.

879
00:44:23,528 --> 00:44:27,396
Uh, why don't you have
someone shine your shoes?

880
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:33,881
Ever since Clarence down
at the courthouse retired

881
00:44:33,905 --> 00:44:35,216
and his cousin took over,

882
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,318
I have been unable

883
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:40,387
to find acceptable
shoe maintenance.

884
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:42,878
See, he... He didn't
get in there too good.

885
00:44:44,449 --> 00:44:45,759
Any time I go in the courtroom,

886
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:48,229
first thing the jury
looks at is my hair,

887
00:44:48,253 --> 00:44:51,765
my suit and right in there.

888
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:56,337
Matlock and Matlock.

889
00:44:56,361 --> 00:44:59,707
Yes, he is. Who's
calling, please?

890
00:44:59,731 --> 00:45:01,608
Oh, well, one moment.

891
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:04,912
Very mysterious. Says
you're expecting him.

892
00:45:04,936 --> 00:45:06,602
Hm.

893
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,316
I'm Ben Matlock.

894
00:45:11,342 --> 00:45:13,353
Yes.

895
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,577
I'll be there.

896
00:45:15,613 --> 00:45:16,690
Well, who was that?

897
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,959
Steve Emerson's alibi.

898
00:45:52,717 --> 00:45:54,227
I'm Ben Matlock.

899
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,062
No kidding.

900
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:59,633
Here, Mary Beth.
Have a nice trip.

901
00:45:59,657 --> 00:46:01,124
Where are you going?

902
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:05,494
Far away.

903
00:46:12,036 --> 00:46:15,515
You have a proposition for me?

904
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:18,385
You testify you were
with Emerson that night.

905
00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:21,454
I spoke to a couple
of the federal boys.

906
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:23,924
They'll put you in the
witness protection program.

907
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:25,659
Well, what's in it for them?

908
00:46:25,683 --> 00:46:29,497
You tell them what you
were gonna tell Emerson.

909
00:46:30,722 --> 00:46:32,432
Well, what about the money?

910
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,869
Doesn't look like you need it.

911
00:46:34,893 --> 00:46:37,104
I just run this place
for some people.

912
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:39,473
What about the $50,000?

913
00:46:39,497 --> 00:46:41,375
Too late for that.

914
00:46:41,399 --> 00:46:43,677
Well, I don't like it.

915
00:46:43,701 --> 00:46:45,512
I don't blame you.

916
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:47,414
But if I were in your position,

917
00:46:47,438 --> 00:46:50,272
I'd take the best deal
I can get. This is it.

918
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:56,245
Okay.

919
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:00,060
Be at my office 10:00
tomorrow morning.

920
00:47:00,084 --> 00:47:02,685
I'll have the
federal boys there.

What the hell is going on here?

941
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:52,573
A man's been shot over there.

942
00:49:02,473 --> 00:49:04,040
He's dead.

943
00:49:19,757 --> 00:49:21,735
Heard you wanna read
that before you sign it?

944
00:49:21,759 --> 00:49:25,105
It's a habit of
mine, lieutenant.

945
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:27,541
You know, I can't
understand something.

946
00:49:27,565 --> 00:49:31,679
You were with some
hood in an nightclub at night

947
00:49:31,703 --> 00:49:34,047
and you have no
idea who iced him?

948
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:36,483
If I had a glimmer,
I'd share it with you.

949
00:49:36,507 --> 00:49:38,052
It could only help my client.

950
00:49:38,076 --> 00:49:41,555
The death of this man Webber
is very bad news for our side.

951
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:43,157
You know, I've heard
about you, Matlock.

952
00:49:43,181 --> 00:49:45,960
And if you're suppressing
evidence, I will nail you.

953
00:49:45,984 --> 00:49:48,295
You can't have heard much.

954
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,564
You'd know I
don't break the law.

955
00:49:50,588 --> 00:49:52,699
I leave that to
criminals and the police.

956
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:54,067
The police.

957
00:49:56,127 --> 00:49:57,805
Your daughter?

958
00:49:57,829 --> 00:49:59,173
Oh, yeah.

959
00:49:59,197 --> 00:50:01,129
You must be proud.

960
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,144
You know, when she was 16

961
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:06,113
she ran off and
married some bum.

962
00:50:06,137 --> 00:50:09,916
He went to jail,
she got pregnant.

963
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:12,252
The other day I calculated

964
00:50:12,276 --> 00:50:16,223
I have represented
over 400 criminal cases.

965
00:50:16,247 --> 00:50:19,360
People's very lives in my hands.

966
00:50:19,384 --> 00:50:21,828
And I never felt so
much responsibility

967
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:24,497
as trying to raise
my daughter alone.

968
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,601
Always afraid I was
doing the wrong thing.

969
00:50:29,126 --> 00:50:33,039
You know, sometimes no
matter what you do, you...

970
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:34,864
You just can't win.

971
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,844
Maybe.

972
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:42,015
Good night, lieutenant.

973
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,839
Very pretty.

974
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:57,130
Mr. Matlock?

975
00:50:57,154 --> 00:50:59,499
That's right. Come
with us, please.

976
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:01,067
Why should I do that?

977
00:51:01,091 --> 00:51:03,770
Let's keep this
polite, shall we?

978
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:05,538
As a matter of practice,

979
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:09,943
I like to know where I'm
going and who I'm going with.

980
00:51:12,136 --> 00:51:13,346
By all means.

981
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:15,671
This way, please.

982
00:51:39,997 --> 00:51:42,197
Take the blindfold off.

983
00:51:52,176 --> 00:51:54,554
Ben Matlock, I'm Ernie Marzell.

984
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:56,723
I recognize you from
your photographs.

985
00:51:56,747 --> 00:51:58,458
Sorry to invite you
here in this fashion

986
00:51:58,482 --> 00:52:00,460
but it's something
of an emergency.

987
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:03,029
You're in no danger, and
you can leave after we talk.

988
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:04,664
What's the emergency?

989
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:07,668
The untimely death
of Billy Ray Webber.

990
00:52:07,692 --> 00:52:09,369
What about it?

991
00:52:09,393 --> 00:52:10,703
Billy Ray was my trusted friend.

992
00:52:10,727 --> 00:52:12,772
I'm very distressed
by his murder.

993
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,007
I didn't see who did it.

994
00:52:14,031 --> 00:52:16,076
Perhaps there's some detail.

995
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:17,644
Anything to give us some clue

996
00:52:17,668 --> 00:52:19,913
to the identity of his killer.

997
00:52:19,937 --> 00:52:21,648
I'm afraid I didn't
see much of anything.

998
00:52:21,672 --> 00:52:23,583
It was very dark.

999
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:28,388
It's important that I
know who is responsible.

1000
00:52:28,412 --> 00:52:29,923
I was meeting with Billy Ray

1001
00:52:29,947 --> 00:52:32,359
to discuss a story
he had for sale.

1002
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:37,164
About organized crime getting
involved with the state house.

1003
00:52:37,188 --> 00:52:41,301
What are you saying?
Billy Ray was a snitch?

1004
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:42,903
That's one way to put it.

1005
00:52:42,927 --> 00:52:45,806
That's very upsetting news.

1006
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:47,240
If it's news to you,

1007
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:49,509
I suspect whoever
killed Linda Coolidge

1008
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:50,811
did in Billy Ray.

1009
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:54,347
What do you mean?
That newsman? Emerson?

1010
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:56,449
No, Billy Ray was his alibi.

1011
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:57,984
He wouldn't kill him.

1012
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:01,243
But someone who was part
of Webber's story could have.

1013
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:06,126
Naturally I know very little
about state government.

1014
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:07,827
Nothing about organized crime.

1015
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,984
You've led a sheltered life.

1016
00:53:11,255 --> 00:53:14,467
My father was a tailor.

1017
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:16,369
Before I told my friends

1018
00:53:16,393 --> 00:53:20,506
to call me Ernie
"The Tailor" Marzell.

1019
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:23,143
Whenever I'm aggravated,
nothing makes me feel better

1020
00:53:23,167 --> 00:53:24,511
than to hem a pair of pants.

1021
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:28,403
Personally I prefer
to shine my shoes.

1022
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,652
You don't know of a
good shoeshine stand

1023
00:53:31,676 --> 00:53:32,953
anywhere around town, do you?

1024
00:53:32,977 --> 00:53:34,976
I only wear suede.

1025
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,725
That's a thought.

1026
00:53:38,749 --> 00:53:41,661
Well, I guess I'll be going.

1027
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:43,696
Mr. Matlock, I understand

1028
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,933
that you're a very
fine defense attorney.

1029
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:50,091
How is it that we've
never had any business?

1030
00:53:51,462 --> 00:53:54,374
I don't know. Just
lucky, I guess.

1031
00:54:00,938 --> 00:54:03,258
Take Mr. Matlock
back to his car.

1032
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,207
You all right?

1033
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:40,887
I suppose.

1034
00:54:40,911 --> 00:54:42,777
You've been awfully quiet.

1035
00:54:44,048 --> 00:54:45,826
I guess tonight

1036
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:48,290
reminded me of those
last few months with Linda.

1037
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:51,965
All the paparazzi.

1038
00:54:51,989 --> 00:54:55,234
I'm sorry I lost my temper.

1039
00:54:55,258 --> 00:54:57,871
It's all right. No,
it's not all right.

1040
00:54:57,895 --> 00:55:00,374
I'm used to taking the heat.

1041
00:55:00,398 --> 00:55:04,110
I guess this just affected
me more than I realized.

1042
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,533
You're only human.

1043
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:11,384
One day I'm a hotshot
TV news correspondent.

1044
00:55:11,408 --> 00:55:14,320
Next day I'm on
trial for murder,

1045
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:17,491
already convicted in the
press and my life is on hold.

1046
00:55:17,515 --> 00:55:18,814
Film at 11.

1047
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:24,631
You are doing the smart thing.

1048
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:26,233
You're taking action.

1049
00:55:26,257 --> 00:55:28,168
I admire you for that.

1050
00:55:28,192 --> 00:55:29,691
You know, you're terrific.

1051
00:55:35,466 --> 00:55:37,077
I have to go.

1052
00:55:37,101 --> 00:55:38,712
You really have to go?

1053
00:55:38,736 --> 00:55:41,180
It's a big day tomorrow.

1054
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:43,305
Ben does like to start early.

1055
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:00,888
Well, good night.

1056
00:56:02,393 --> 00:56:03,525
Good night.

1057
00:56:04,961 --> 00:56:06,039
Thanks again.

1058
00:56:06,063 --> 00:56:08,330
Yeah.

1059
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,213
Uh, ha.

1060
00:56:13,237 --> 00:56:15,270
I really do have to go.

1061
00:56:19,243 --> 00:56:20,387
Bye.

1062
00:56:20,411 --> 00:56:22,177
Good night.

1063
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:36,069
Well, this is just perfect.

1064
00:56:36,093 --> 00:56:40,206
Why in the hell didn't he shoot
somebody while he was at it?

1065
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:42,608
You really can't blame
him, Ben. They're vultures.

1066
00:56:42,632 --> 00:56:45,711
Charlene, this paper's gonna
be in every checkout line

1067
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:47,614
in every supermarket
in this city.

1068
00:56:47,638 --> 00:56:49,149
Do you know how
many prospective jurors

1069
00:56:49,173 --> 00:56:50,817
are gonna see this? All of 'em.

1070
00:56:50,841 --> 00:56:53,353
The<i> Informer</i> is gonna
print whatever it wants

1071
00:56:53,377 --> 00:56:54,688
whether it's true or not.

1072
00:56:54,712 --> 00:56:55,889
You mean like: "The two of 'em

1073
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:59,214
were entwined in
intimate conversation"?

1074
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:01,961
Just what are you suggesting?

1075
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:04,797
I'm suggesting you
used very poor judgment

1076
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:06,766
going up to his room
after what happened.

1077
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:08,801
What if they'd photographed
you coming out of there?

1078
00:57:08,825 --> 00:57:10,670
Are you worried about
his reputation or mine?

1079
00:57:10,694 --> 00:57:12,138
Just how involved are you?

1080
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:13,874
Are you asking as
a lawyer or a father?

1081
00:57:13,898 --> 00:57:14,875
Both.

1082
00:57:14,899 --> 00:57:16,176
Well, the answer to both of you

1083
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,343
is that I resent the question.

1084
00:57:17,367 --> 00:57:18,812
That's not an answer.

1085
00:57:18,836 --> 00:57:21,035
Oh, yes it is.

1086
00:57:23,073 --> 00:57:24,617
Yes?

1087
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:26,552
Send him in.

1088
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:28,888
Our favorite client.

1089
00:57:28,912 --> 00:57:30,624
I was just reading about you.

1090
00:57:30,648 --> 00:57:32,592
What's all this about you
and Billy Ray Webber?

1091
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:33,993
I just saw it on the news.

1092
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:35,895
He's the guy I was with
the night Linda was killed.

1093
00:57:35,919 --> 00:57:38,297
What happened? He's dead.

1094
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:41,134
And the mob didn't do it. I
was talking with one of 'em.

1095
00:57:41,158 --> 00:57:43,369
They're as anxious to find
out who did it as we are.

1096
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:44,704
Well, what do we do now?

1097
00:57:44,728 --> 00:57:46,640
I'll tell you what<i> you</i> do now.

1098
00:57:46,664 --> 00:57:49,175
You give me your
word you'll do as I say,

1099
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:51,600
when I say it, or get
yourself another lawyer.

1100
00:57:54,838 --> 00:57:56,598
All right, you've got it.

1101
00:57:58,142 --> 00:58:00,787
Jury selection starts
Monday. We have no alibi,

1102
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:03,456
and no way to establish
reasonable doubt.

1103
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,860
What we need is a
bright idea, and soon.

1104
00:58:06,884 --> 00:58:08,094
Good morning, people.

1105
00:58:08,118 --> 00:58:10,763
And have I got some
hot news for you.

1106
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:12,499
We are in the
market for hot news.

1107
00:58:12,523 --> 00:58:14,467
Yeah, well here it is.

1108
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,870
Now, maybe no one
listens to the weatherman.

1109
00:58:16,894 --> 00:58:20,340
But the weatherman sure
listens to everyone else.

1110
00:58:20,364 --> 00:58:24,210
Seems our Linda Coolidge
was one very ambitious lady.

1111
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:25,512
Now, I hate to say it, pal,

1112
00:58:25,536 --> 00:58:28,269
but her apartment
had a swinging door.

1113
00:58:30,107 --> 00:58:31,684
She had two rejected lovers

1114
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:34,154
on the staff with
motives for murder:

1115
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:35,677
McCall and White.

1116
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:38,157
You got any proof?

1117
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:39,459
No.

1118
00:58:39,483 --> 00:58:41,995
But evidently there was
some type of red leather diary?

1119
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:44,564
Yeah.

1120
00:58:44,588 --> 00:58:47,133
It was about so big.

1121
00:58:47,157 --> 00:58:49,469
She wrote everything in it.
Her ideas, her appointments.

1122
00:58:49,493 --> 00:58:51,137
She never went
anywhere without it.

1123
00:58:51,161 --> 00:58:52,794
Did you see it the
night of the murder?

1124
00:58:54,331 --> 00:58:56,809
Yeah, it was on
her coffee table.

1125
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:59,746
Well, it's not there now,
and the police don't have it.

1126
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:01,381
Well, if it was
there when you left,

1127
00:59:01,405 --> 00:59:03,883
and gone by the time
the police got there,

1128
00:59:03,907 --> 00:59:05,987
the murderer
might have taken it.

1129
00:59:06,744 --> 00:59:08,054
Leaves us nowhere.

1130
00:59:08,078 --> 00:59:10,445
Not necessarily.

1131
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:15,384
I think I just got
a bright idea.

1132
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:23,970
You reside in Atlanta,

1133
00:59:23,994 --> 00:59:26,105
and you are an
accountant, is that correct?

1134
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:27,641
That's right, sir.

1135
00:59:27,665 --> 00:59:29,643
We are endeavoring
to impanel a jury

1136
00:59:29,667 --> 00:59:32,645
to try an indictment
against Steve Emerson.

1137
00:59:32,669 --> 00:59:34,680
That indictment charges him

1138
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:36,583
with the murder
of Linda Coolidge.

1139
00:59:36,607 --> 00:59:39,085
Have you read anything
about this in the paper?

1140
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:40,486
Or have you heard
anything about it

1141
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:41,721
over the various news media?

1142
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:42,989
Oh, yes.

1143
00:59:43,013 --> 00:59:44,157
Take a look at this.

1144
00:59:44,181 --> 00:59:47,327
I see. Mr. Cooper...
What do you think?

1145
00:59:47,351 --> 00:59:49,829
Terrific.

1146
00:59:49,853 --> 00:59:51,664
Go to it. But watch your step.

1147
00:59:51,688 --> 00:59:54,334
Or any conscientious scruples
which would prevent you

1148
00:59:54,358 --> 00:59:55,935
from returning a verdict

1149
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:57,670
which would make it
mandatory upon the court

1150
00:59:57,694 --> 00:59:59,905
to impose the death sentence?

1151
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:01,240
No, sir.

1152
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:02,931
Thank you.

1153
01:00:04,668 --> 01:00:06,588
Mr. Matlock, your witness.

1154
01:00:10,473 --> 01:00:11,906
Mr. Cooper,

1155
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:16,723
we didn't get you up too early
to come down here, did we?

1156
01:00:16,747 --> 01:00:18,124
No, I'm an early riser.

1157
01:00:18,148 --> 01:00:19,659
Yeah, me too.

1158
01:00:19,683 --> 01:00:21,761
Gives me a chance
to read the papers

1159
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:23,129
and look at the news on TV.

1160
01:00:23,153 --> 01:00:24,864
Is that the same
for you? Oh, yes.

1161
01:00:24,888 --> 01:00:26,432
Yeah.

1162
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:28,000
You were telling Mr. Hawkins

1163
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:31,404
that, uh, you read something
about this case in the paper.

1164
01:00:31,428 --> 01:00:34,173
Are you a regular
subscriber to any newspaper?

1165
01:00:34,197 --> 01:00:35,708
We get the <i>Atlanta Constitution.</i>

1166
01:00:35,732 --> 01:00:36,709
Uh, we get the<i> News.</i>

1167
01:00:36,733 --> 01:00:38,944
We get the<i> Weekly Courier.</i>

1168
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,647
And so I take it
from time to time

1169
01:00:40,671 --> 01:00:43,516
you've read something about
this case in those papers.

1170
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:44,772
Oh, that's right.

1171
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:49,622
Does your wife ever bring
home the<i> National Informer</i>?

1172
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,758
Oh. Heh. Sometimes.

1173
01:00:51,782 --> 01:00:53,326
Yeah.

1174
01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:56,062
What do you think about
these papers and the TV news?

1175
01:00:56,086 --> 01:00:58,331
You think they've done a
reliable job covering this case?

1176
01:00:58,355 --> 01:00:59,966
I'd say so.

1177
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:01,968
You tend to believe it.

1178
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:03,758
Yes.

1179
01:01:06,062 --> 01:01:08,674
Did you see last
week's<i> Informer?</i>

1180
01:01:08,698 --> 01:01:10,843
The one with the
headline that said,

1181
01:01:10,867 --> 01:01:14,202
"Psychic Says Emerson
Killed Coolidge."

1182
01:01:15,205 --> 01:01:17,271
Yes. Uh...

1183
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:25,091
Uh... Your Honor,

1184
01:01:25,115 --> 01:01:27,126
we have a real problem here.

1185
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:29,762
If, uh, Mr. Cooper
read that article

1186
01:01:29,786 --> 01:01:30,930
and believes what he read,

1187
01:01:30,954 --> 01:01:33,733
then he can hardly be
considered impartial.

1188
01:01:33,757 --> 01:01:36,535
Now, on that ground, I
have no choice but to request

1189
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,526
that he be excused for cause.

1190
01:01:40,431 --> 01:01:42,431
You're excused for
cause, Mr. Cooper.

1191
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,433
Go the the second floor, please.

1192
01:01:50,674 --> 01:01:52,352
They call it, ahem,
selecting the jury.

1193
01:01:52,376 --> 01:01:53,486
You don't select the jury.

1194
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:55,220
You kick off the ones
you really don't want

1195
01:01:55,244 --> 01:01:57,378
and what's left is the jury.

1196
01:01:58,581 --> 01:02:00,593
Any luck tying Ernie
Marzell into this case?

1197
01:02:00,617 --> 01:02:01,861
Not yet.

1198
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:04,297
Well, if... If he's involved
in state government,

1199
01:02:04,321 --> 01:02:05,932
somebody's got to know it.

1200
01:02:05,956 --> 01:02:07,934
Well, I'll put out a few
feelers. I'll stay in touch.

1201
01:02:07,958 --> 01:02:09,702
Right.

1202
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,538
<i>Jury selection continues</i>

1203
01:02:11,562 --> 01:02:13,106
in the Emerson/Coolidge
murder case

1204
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:15,608
with a trial expected
to begin on Monday.

1205
01:02:15,632 --> 01:02:16,943
I'm Nelson White,

1206
01:02:16,967 --> 01:02:19,345
and we'll look for you
at our 6:00 news roundup

1207
01:02:19,369 --> 01:02:20,768
this evening.

1208
01:02:21,971 --> 01:02:23,349
And you're clear.

1209
01:02:23,373 --> 01:02:24,818
Very nice, Mr. White, sir.

1210
01:02:24,842 --> 01:02:26,074
I'll take that for you.

1211
01:02:32,516 --> 01:02:34,294
Excuse me, Mr. White.

1212
01:02:34,318 --> 01:02:36,096
If you want to talk to
me, use a subpoena.

1213
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:38,164
Oh, no, we don't wanna do that.

1214
01:02:38,188 --> 01:02:40,400
Well, maybe we do.

1215
01:02:40,424 --> 01:02:43,202
I mean, you've become such
an important figure in this case.

1216
01:02:44,328 --> 01:02:45,772
I can't imagine why.

1217
01:02:45,796 --> 01:02:47,874
Because of your affair
with Linda Coolidge.

1218
01:02:47,898 --> 01:02:49,576
Who told you that?

1219
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:53,546
I'm sure you must
recognize this.

1220
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:54,570
Don't you?

1221
01:02:55,939 --> 01:02:57,183
Linda's diary.

1222
01:02:57,207 --> 01:02:59,152
She wrote about me in there?

1223
01:02:59,176 --> 01:03:02,054
Mr. White, now, how's
it gonna look to people

1224
01:03:02,078 --> 01:03:03,690
if they found out you
had an affair with her

1225
01:03:03,714 --> 01:03:04,924
and then she broke it off,

1226
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:06,793
and then she tried to take
over your news program

1227
01:03:06,817 --> 01:03:08,128
and get you fired.

1228
01:03:08,152 --> 01:03:12,265
I mean, it looks like you
have a motive for murder.

1229
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:14,000
Now, seriously,

1230
01:03:14,024 --> 01:03:16,458
wouldn't you really
rather talk to me, hm?

1231
01:03:19,696 --> 01:03:23,243
Look, it took me a
while to figure out

1232
01:03:23,267 --> 01:03:27,112
what a... user she was.

1233
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:29,315
But she didn't break up with me.

1234
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:30,616
I'm the one who called it off,

1235
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,441
when I found out
she was after my job.

1236
01:03:35,112 --> 01:03:36,155
Isn't that in there too?

1237
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:37,524
No.

1238
01:03:37,548 --> 01:03:38,892
It's not?

1239
01:03:38,916 --> 01:03:40,347
No, it's not.

1240
01:03:41,685 --> 01:03:44,953
Well, thanks for your time.

1241
01:03:46,089 --> 01:03:47,322
Oh,

1242
01:03:49,459 --> 01:03:51,871
here's the subpoena,
just in case.

1243
01:03:55,765 --> 01:03:57,310
What did you find
when you arrived

1244
01:03:57,334 --> 01:03:58,611
at the decedent's apartment?

1245
01:03:58,635 --> 01:04:01,381
Miss Coolidge was lying
on the living room floor

1246
01:04:01,405 --> 01:04:03,082
bleeding from a chest wound.

1247
01:04:03,106 --> 01:04:05,151
Mm-hm. Did you
summon medical help?

1248
01:04:05,175 --> 01:04:06,485
The security guard

1249
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:09,122
at the apartment complex
had already done that.

1250
01:04:09,146 --> 01:04:11,056
The paramedics
arrived shortly after I did.

1251
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:12,725
They determined she was dead.

1252
01:04:12,749 --> 01:04:14,449
Mm-hm.

1253
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:18,253
I show you People's Exhibit 2...

1254
01:04:20,557 --> 01:04:22,335
and ask if you recognize it.

1255
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:25,138
Yes, that's a .38
caliber revolver.

1256
01:04:25,162 --> 01:04:27,440
Was a ballistics test
performed on this revolver?

1257
01:04:27,464 --> 01:04:28,707
Yes, it was.

1258
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:30,343
What was the
result of that test?

1259
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:32,511
Ballistics tests
determined that the bullet

1260
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:35,381
removed from Miss Coolidge's
chest was fired from that gun.

1261
01:04:35,405 --> 01:04:37,583
Where was this gun found?

1262
01:04:37,607 --> 01:04:39,318
On the floorboard
of a rented car

1263
01:04:39,342 --> 01:04:41,521
parked outside of the
apartment complex.

1264
01:04:41,545 --> 01:04:45,458
To whom was this
car rented at the time?

1265
01:04:45,482 --> 01:04:47,916
Mr. Steve Emerson.

1266
01:04:51,854 --> 01:04:53,134
Thank you.

1267
01:04:55,692 --> 01:04:57,057
No further questions.

1268
01:04:58,295 --> 01:04:59,739
Your witness.

1269
01:04:59,763 --> 01:05:02,029
No questions, Your Honor.

1270
01:05:09,172 --> 01:05:10,716
Mr. McCall.

1271
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,084
Oh, hello. What is it?

1272
01:05:12,108 --> 01:05:13,820
You've been quite a
help to Steve Emerson.

1273
01:05:13,844 --> 01:05:15,087
We're all very grateful.

1274
01:05:15,111 --> 01:05:16,823
Oh, well, I'm sure he'd
do the same for me.

1275
01:05:16,847 --> 01:05:19,058
No, really. You've
gone out of your way.

1276
01:05:19,082 --> 01:05:21,594
Well, uh, no, it
was nothing, really.

1277
01:05:21,618 --> 01:05:22,929
Listen, would you excuse me?

1278
01:05:22,953 --> 01:05:25,364
'Cause, uh, I have some
people waiting for me.

1279
01:05:25,388 --> 01:05:27,066
But as helpful as
you've been to Steve,

1280
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:29,501
I can never seem to
pinpoint you for an interview.

1281
01:05:29,525 --> 01:05:31,003
Well, that is
because, young lady,

1282
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:33,172
I have nothing to add
that would be very useful,

1283
01:05:33,196 --> 01:05:34,373
I'm afraid.

1284
01:05:34,397 --> 01:05:37,143
Now, if you will excuse me,

1285
01:05:37,167 --> 01:05:38,544
I am running a bit late.

1286
01:05:38,568 --> 01:05:40,746
Gee, you could always
find time for Linda Coolidge

1287
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:43,071
in the middle of the
afternoon, couldn't you.

1288
01:05:47,077 --> 01:05:49,488
Just what the hell is
that supposed to mean?

1289
01:05:49,512 --> 01:05:52,858
This makes for
very good reading.

1290
01:05:52,882 --> 01:05:53,882
Hm.

1291
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:56,629
All right, why don't
you just tell me

1292
01:05:56,653 --> 01:05:58,665
what it is you want from me, hm?

1293
01:05:58,689 --> 01:05:59,832
I'm just curious.

1294
01:05:59,856 --> 01:06:01,500
When Linda Coolidge
broke off your affair,

1295
01:06:01,524 --> 01:06:03,369
were you so angry
that you murdered her?

1296
01:06:04,761 --> 01:06:05,960
She wasn't worth it.

1297
01:06:07,597 --> 01:06:09,241
Although I did, uh...

1298
01:06:09,265 --> 01:06:12,700
Yeah, I threw away a
15-year marriage for her.

1299
01:06:14,537 --> 01:06:17,783
And I suppose there
was a moment when I...

1300
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:20,019
I would have loved
to have killed her.

1301
01:06:20,043 --> 01:06:22,355
But I, uh...

1302
01:06:22,379 --> 01:06:24,790
Well, I guess I
just wasn't up to it.

1303
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:27,860
Satisfied?

1304
01:06:27,884 --> 01:06:29,562
Pretty much.

1305
01:06:29,586 --> 01:06:32,086
But here's a
subpoena, just in case.

1306
01:06:36,093 --> 01:06:38,404
Now, Mrs. Harris,

1307
01:06:38,428 --> 01:06:41,674
you testified that you saw
Steve Emerson, the defendant,

1308
01:06:41,698 --> 01:06:43,909
enter Linda Coolidge's apartment

1309
01:06:43,933 --> 01:06:46,078
at exactly 9:30
p.m., is that correct?

1310
01:06:46,102 --> 01:06:47,613
Yes, sir, it is.

1311
01:06:47,637 --> 01:06:50,917
How did you fix
on that exact time?

1312
01:06:50,941 --> 01:06:54,153
There's a clock on
top of my television set.

1313
01:06:54,177 --> 01:06:56,455
Oh, I see. I see.

1314
01:06:56,479 --> 01:06:58,091
You were looking at TV,

1315
01:06:58,115 --> 01:07:01,794
and when the program was
over you took your dog for a walk,

1316
01:07:01,818 --> 01:07:02,794
is that correct?

1317
01:07:02,818 --> 01:07:03,896
Yes, it is.

1318
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,264
Well, that certainly explains

1319
01:07:05,288 --> 01:07:08,334
why you're so precise
as to the time. Hm.

1320
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:10,937
Uh, now, Mrs.
Harris, you testified

1321
01:07:10,961 --> 01:07:14,774
that before the
gunshot, at 10:15,

1322
01:07:14,798 --> 01:07:19,045
you heard Steve Emerson
and Linda Coolidge arguing.

1323
01:07:19,069 --> 01:07:20,179
That's right.

1324
01:07:20,203 --> 01:07:22,815
Could you make out
what they were saying?

1325
01:07:22,839 --> 01:07:28,153
Well, I couldn't make it
out, but it sounded angry.

1326
01:07:28,177 --> 01:07:30,990
Well, how do you know it
was Steve Emerson's voice?

1327
01:07:31,014 --> 01:07:34,660
Well, I've been watching
him on television for years.

1328
01:07:34,684 --> 01:07:36,629
I recognized it.

1329
01:07:36,653 --> 01:07:40,432
Mrs. Harris, isn't it true

1330
01:07:40,456 --> 01:07:43,135
that you fixed the
time of the gunshot

1331
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:45,237
because you were looking at TV

1332
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:47,540
and you saw that clock
you were talking about?

1333
01:07:47,564 --> 01:07:49,475
Yes.

1334
01:07:49,499 --> 01:07:51,444
Mrs. Harris,

1335
01:07:51,468 --> 01:07:55,548
how can you be looking
at and listening to TV,

1336
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:57,583
and identify Steve
Emerson's voice

1337
01:07:57,607 --> 01:07:59,685
through the apartment wall?

1338
01:07:59,709 --> 01:08:01,542
I heard him.

1339
01:08:05,849 --> 01:08:10,263
I suppose you can
assume it was his voice,

1340
01:08:10,287 --> 01:08:12,565
since you saw him
enter the apartment,

1341
01:08:12,589 --> 01:08:15,001
45 minutes earlier.

1342
01:08:15,025 --> 01:08:17,158
That's right.

1343
01:08:18,662 --> 01:08:20,194
Thank you, Mrs. Harris.

1344
01:08:21,798 --> 01:08:23,918
No further questions,
Your Honor.

1345
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:27,113
You may be excused.

1346
01:08:29,739 --> 01:08:32,085
Do you wanna tell me
why you let her off so easy?

1347
01:08:32,109 --> 01:08:34,387
I made my point.

1348
01:08:34,411 --> 01:08:36,155
If I had kept after
her, she'd have dug in

1349
01:08:36,179 --> 01:08:38,191
and stuck to her story
come hell or high water.

1350
01:08:38,215 --> 01:08:41,015
Look like I was harassing
a nice, sweet lady.

1351
01:08:45,155 --> 01:08:47,621
Could you tell me if she
sublet her apartment to anyone?

1352
01:08:50,093 --> 01:08:51,870
No. No, I wouldn't
be interested.

1353
01:08:51,894 --> 01:08:53,194
Thank you.

1354
01:08:56,032 --> 01:08:57,075
Where have you been?

1355
01:08:57,099 --> 01:08:59,645
Oh, Corporations Commission.

1356
01:08:59,669 --> 01:09:00,779
How did it go today

1357
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:02,548
with the flashing that
phony diary around?

1358
01:09:02,572 --> 01:09:03,882
Not great.

1359
01:09:03,906 --> 01:09:06,518
Both McCall and White
thought it was the real thing.

1360
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:09,288
So I guess that eliminates them.

1361
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:11,824
Maybe I should
try it on Lockwood.

1362
01:09:11,848 --> 01:09:13,893
The boyfriend? Why?

1363
01:09:13,917 --> 01:09:16,695
Well, if he and Linda were to be
married at the end of the month,

1364
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:18,830
why would she make
plans to sublet her apartment

1365
01:09:18,854 --> 01:09:19,965
and then go to New York?

1366
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:22,702
Maybe Mr. Lockwood
was gonna go with her.

1367
01:09:22,726 --> 01:09:24,270
And walk away from his business?

1368
01:09:24,294 --> 01:09:27,094
Maybe. And maybe not.

1369
01:09:28,698 --> 01:09:30,509
So where you going now?

1370
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:32,711
I'm gonna go try
this on Lockwood.

1371
01:09:32,735 --> 01:09:34,346
Let me go with you.

1372
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:35,781
No way, Tyler.

1373
01:09:35,805 --> 01:09:37,338
This one's on me.

1374
01:09:38,608 --> 01:09:40,274
Hm.

1375
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:49,227
So at no time did you
ever see Mr. Emerson

1376
01:09:49,251 --> 01:09:50,696
leave the building?

1377
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:52,665
Uh, no, I did not.

1378
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:56,302
And from the position
of your desk in the lobby,

1379
01:09:56,326 --> 01:09:58,537
he would have
had to pass by you.

1380
01:09:58,561 --> 01:10:00,072
That's right.

1381
01:10:00,096 --> 01:10:01,996
And you never left your desk.

1382
01:10:03,867 --> 01:10:07,112
Uh, not until I got the
call about the gunshot.

1383
01:10:07,136 --> 01:10:08,303
Right.

1384
01:10:09,472 --> 01:10:10,650
Thank you.

1385
01:10:10,674 --> 01:10:11,906
No further questions.

1386
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:13,975
Your witness.

1387
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:18,991
Mr. Banning,

1388
01:10:19,015 --> 01:10:21,894
how does a person gain
access to your building?

1389
01:10:21,918 --> 01:10:25,130
Uh, either through
the front entrance

1390
01:10:25,154 --> 01:10:27,666
or, if they have a key,
the garage elevator.

1391
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:30,570
All right. Who has these keys?

1392
01:10:30,594 --> 01:10:31,594
The tenants.

1393
01:10:32,929 --> 01:10:35,541
Do you know how many keys
were issued to Linda Coolidge?

1394
01:10:35,565 --> 01:10:37,576
Two, I believe.

1395
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,800
Heh. Thank you, Mr. Banning.

1396
01:10:40,637 --> 01:10:42,570
Oh, by the way,

1397
01:10:44,541 --> 01:10:47,787
are you familiar with
the<i> National Informer?</i>

1398
01:10:47,811 --> 01:10:49,243
Am I what?

1399
01:10:51,014 --> 01:10:53,280
Have you ever read
the<i> National Informer</i>?

1400
01:10:54,517 --> 01:10:56,517
Uh... Oh...

1401
01:10:58,989 --> 01:11:00,554
Well, ye... Yes.

1402
01:11:02,325 --> 01:11:05,571
Isn't it true that reporters
and photographers

1403
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:07,840
were at the entrance
to your building

1404
01:11:07,864 --> 01:11:10,843
shortly after
Mr. Emerson arrived?

1405
01:11:10,867 --> 01:11:13,246
Uh, I believe so, yes.

1406
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:16,148
Now, Mr. Banning,
it's my understanding

1407
01:11:16,172 --> 01:11:19,318
that, uh, publications,
ahem, like the<i> Informer,</i>

1408
01:11:19,342 --> 01:11:21,787
ones that deal in
gossip and such,

1409
01:11:21,811 --> 01:11:24,757
frequently pay
people to alert them

1410
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:27,526
as to the comings and
goings of celebrities.

1411
01:11:27,550 --> 01:11:30,095
Now, that's always
seemed curious to me,

1412
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:35,167
that they got there so soon
after Mr. Emerson arrived.

1413
01:11:35,191 --> 01:11:38,559
How do you suppose
they knew he was there?

1414
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:42,141
I-I don't know.

1415
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:46,645
I want you to
think very carefully

1416
01:11:46,669 --> 01:11:49,682
before you answer
this next question.

1417
01:11:49,706 --> 01:11:52,473
Did you call them the
night of the murder?

1418
01:11:57,013 --> 01:11:58,524
No.

1419
01:11:58,548 --> 01:12:02,583
Have you ever received money
from the<i> National Informer?</i>

1420
01:12:03,386 --> 01:12:04,386
No.

1421
01:12:07,023 --> 01:12:08,067
Sir, would you stand?

1422
01:12:09,425 --> 01:12:11,137
Do you recognize that gentleman

1423
01:12:11,161 --> 01:12:14,962
as Mr. J.L. Dupree of
the<i> National Informer?</i>

1424
01:12:18,435 --> 01:12:20,112
Uh, no.

1425
01:12:20,136 --> 01:12:24,016
Now, the<i> National Informer</i>
keeps very careful records

1426
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:27,352
of all cash disbursements.

1427
01:12:27,376 --> 01:12:30,089
Before I call
Mr. Dupree to the stand,

1428
01:12:30,113 --> 01:12:32,724
I want to give you
the opportunity

1429
01:12:32,748 --> 01:12:36,328
to reconsider your testimony.

1430
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:40,287
And remember, you're under oath.

1431
01:12:43,326 --> 01:12:45,960
Did you call them the
night of the murder?

1432
01:12:54,303 --> 01:12:55,803
Did you call 'em?

1433
01:12:57,106 --> 01:12:58,106
Well...

1434
01:13:00,443 --> 01:13:02,388
Yes. And when they arrived,

1435
01:13:02,412 --> 01:13:04,623
you met them at
the front entrance,

1436
01:13:04,647 --> 01:13:06,792
talked with them and
they gave you money.

1437
01:13:06,816 --> 01:13:08,494
Isn't that correct?

1438
01:13:08,518 --> 01:13:10,295
Yes. And while you were absent

1439
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:12,398
from your desk,
Mr. Emerson could have

1440
01:13:12,422 --> 01:13:14,800
come down to the lobby,
seen them at the entrance,

1441
01:13:14,824 --> 01:13:17,736
gone out a side
door. Isn't that so?

1442
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,105
I was only gone a moment.

1443
01:13:20,129 --> 01:13:22,329
No further questions,
Your Honor.

1444
01:13:23,299 --> 01:13:25,065
You can step down.

1445
01:13:26,936 --> 01:13:30,483
Court will recess until 9
a.m. tomorrow morning.

1446
01:13:34,343 --> 01:13:36,088
Thanks for stopping by, O.J.

1447
01:13:36,112 --> 01:13:37,155
This is Steve Emerson.

1448
01:13:37,179 --> 01:13:39,058
Oh, big fan of yours.
Hi, how are you?

1449
01:13:39,082 --> 01:13:40,693
Anyway, thanks for stopping by.

1450
01:13:40,717 --> 01:13:42,527
Go ahead and order
that field corn for me,

1451
01:13:42,551 --> 01:13:43,796
and I'll settle up next week.

1452
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:45,319
Sure thing. Deal.

1453
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:48,667
Field corn, huh?

1454
01:13:48,691 --> 01:13:50,903
I didn't say he was from
the<i> National Informer.</i>

1455
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:52,805
I just asked him if
he recognized him

1456
01:13:52,829 --> 01:13:55,741
from the<i> National Informer.</i>

1457
01:13:55,765 --> 01:13:58,410
Congratulations, Matlock.

1458
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:00,612
You made quite a run at
discrediting Mrs. Harris,

1459
01:14:00,636 --> 01:14:03,482
hearing Emerson, totally
impeached Banning.

1460
01:14:03,506 --> 01:14:05,183
Very slick stuff.

1461
01:14:05,207 --> 01:14:07,019
Coming from you that's
quite a compliment.

1462
01:14:07,043 --> 01:14:08,854
But I'll tell you something.
I really don't see

1463
01:14:08,878 --> 01:14:12,825
how you're going to get around
not having a convincing alibi.

1464
01:14:12,849 --> 01:14:14,993
And that gun in the car.

1465
01:14:17,854 --> 01:14:19,253
See you tomorrow.

1466
01:14:22,091 --> 01:14:24,611
What are we gonna do about that?

1467
01:14:25,562 --> 01:14:29,329
Oh, we might have a
few surprises left in us.

1468
01:14:30,867 --> 01:14:32,210
I hope so.

1469
01:14:41,577 --> 01:14:43,422
- Where's Charlene?
- I don't know. Why?

1470
01:14:43,446 --> 01:14:45,624
My unimpeachable sources

1471
01:14:45,648 --> 01:14:48,727
say the mob is funding a
big coastal resort project

1472
01:14:48,751 --> 01:14:51,297
currently under review by the
Land Development Commission.

1473
01:14:51,321 --> 01:14:53,232
Anybody on the
commission we know?

1474
01:14:53,256 --> 01:14:54,533
Ah, Mr. Lockwood.

1475
01:14:54,557 --> 01:14:56,869
Mr. Lockwood is a
dollar-a-year man for the state.

1476
01:14:56,893 --> 01:14:58,504
Head of the Land
Development Commission.

1477
01:14:58,528 --> 01:15:01,039
All right. Not so all right.

1478
01:15:01,063 --> 01:15:02,474
Last time I talked to Charlene,

1479
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:05,244
she was on her way out there
to try that diary on Lockwood.

1480
01:15:23,152 --> 01:15:24,129
I don't know about you,

1481
01:15:24,153 --> 01:15:26,397
but I'm going home now.

1482
01:15:26,421 --> 01:15:28,781
He knows I'm still waiting.

1483
01:15:29,058 --> 01:15:30,335
He knows.

1484
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:32,070
Well, thanks.

1485
01:15:32,094 --> 01:15:33,627
Bye.

1486
01:15:47,143 --> 01:15:49,788
Mr. Lockwood, I really
do have to talk to you.

1487
01:15:49,812 --> 01:15:51,090
What do you want?

1488
01:15:51,114 --> 01:15:53,459
Did you have a serious
falling out with Linda Coolidge?

1489
01:15:53,483 --> 01:15:56,828
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

1490
01:15:56,852 --> 01:15:59,665
She made an entry
in her diary about you

1491
01:15:59,689 --> 01:16:01,600
that I really don't understand.

1492
01:16:01,624 --> 01:16:03,068
Her what?

1493
01:16:03,092 --> 01:16:05,137
Her diary. This.

1494
01:16:05,161 --> 01:16:06,539
What is that?

1495
01:16:06,563 --> 01:16:07,843
You don't recognize her diary?

1496
01:16:11,801 --> 01:16:13,379
What kind of a game
are you playing?

1497
01:16:18,708 --> 01:16:21,028
We will see you in
court, Mr. Lockwood.

1498
01:17:14,029 --> 01:17:15,841
<i>Matlock and Matlock.</i>

1499
01:17:15,865 --> 01:17:17,075
<i>At the sound of the tone,</i>

1500
01:17:17,099 --> 01:17:18,844
<i>please leave your
name and number.</i>

1501
01:17:19,935 --> 01:17:21,980
Ben, hi. Uh, it... It's me.

1502
01:17:22,004 --> 01:17:24,650
It's about 8:15 tonight.

1503
01:17:24,674 --> 01:17:26,652
Well, Lockwood's our man.

1504
01:17:26,676 --> 01:17:30,255
He, um... He recognized that
the diary was a phony write-off.

1505
01:17:30,279 --> 01:17:31,857
Anyway, he must
have been the one

1506
01:17:31,881 --> 01:17:34,325
that took it from
Linda's apartment.

1507
01:17:34,349 --> 01:17:38,063
I'm gonna go check
out his office to s...

1508
01:19:38,908 --> 01:19:39,885
Are you all right?

1509
01:19:39,909 --> 01:19:41,674
He did it, Ben. He killed her.

1510
01:19:43,579 --> 01:19:46,680
What are you people
doing in my plant?

1511
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:52,364
You sure you're all right? Yeah.

1512
01:19:52,388 --> 01:19:55,200
It would seem to me
you're trespassing.

1513
01:19:55,224 --> 01:19:57,223
I think you'd better leave.

1514
01:19:58,961 --> 01:20:00,081
Let's go.

1515
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:10,090
I'll be with you in a minute.

1516
01:20:11,907 --> 01:20:13,051
You're all right?

1517
01:20:13,075 --> 01:20:14,140
Yeah.

1518
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:33,338
Would you have risked your
neck like that for any other client?

1519
01:20:33,362 --> 01:20:37,464
Oh, Dad, don't start
on me. Not now.

1520
01:20:38,801 --> 01:20:40,946
I know it's none of my business,

1521
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:42,814
and he's a nice
enough guy, I guess,

1522
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:45,338
but he's here now
because he has to be.

1523
01:20:48,377 --> 01:20:52,558
If he acquitted, he's going
to go back to his own life.

1524
01:20:52,582 --> 01:20:56,194
I said my piece, and I
won't mention it again.

1525
01:20:56,218 --> 01:20:57,284
I promise.

1526
01:21:00,156 --> 01:21:02,055
I'm sure glad you're all right.

1527
01:21:04,793 --> 01:21:06,638
Okay.

1528
01:21:08,664 --> 01:21:11,332
Get some rest. We got a
lot of work to do tomorrow.

1529
01:21:35,257 --> 01:21:38,469
I wanna nail Lockwood to
the side of the barn so bad,

1530
01:21:38,493 --> 01:21:39,470
I can taste it.

1531
01:21:39,494 --> 01:21:41,173
But we don't have anything.

1532
01:21:41,197 --> 01:21:42,440
Nothing at all.

1533
01:21:42,464 --> 01:21:44,109
Well, Lockwood had
motive and access.

1534
01:21:44,133 --> 01:21:45,376
So did Steve.

1535
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,880
Whose side are you on?
Right now I'm on the jury.

1536
01:21:47,904 --> 01:21:50,215
And if we put
this solid citizen,

1537
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:51,917
the grieved fiancé, on the stand

1538
01:21:51,941 --> 01:21:53,518
and grill him over the hot coals

1539
01:21:53,542 --> 01:21:55,387
without so much
as a workable theory

1540
01:21:55,411 --> 01:21:57,089
of how he might
have killed this woman,

1541
01:21:57,113 --> 01:22:01,359
then I'm gonna say let's convict
Steve Emerson and go home.

1542
01:22:01,383 --> 01:22:02,860
I wanna put Paul
Lockwood on the stand,

1543
01:22:02,884 --> 01:22:05,185
but we don't have a
dime's worth of anything.

1544
01:22:06,855 --> 01:22:08,166
Well, he was
supposed to have been

1545
01:22:08,190 --> 01:22:10,002
at this fundraiser at
the Mayfair all evening.

1546
01:22:10,026 --> 01:22:11,904
How do we get around
that? Tyler's down there now

1547
01:22:11,928 --> 01:22:15,773
trying to find anybody who
saw him leave before 10:15.

1548
01:22:15,797 --> 01:22:18,276
Charlene said there was
some TV news footage

1549
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:20,412
taken outside the
apartment building that night.

1550
01:22:20,436 --> 01:22:22,113
It's at the station.

1551
01:22:22,137 --> 01:22:23,482
Can we look at it?

1552
01:22:23,506 --> 01:22:25,216
I'm sure McCall would cooperate.

1553
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:27,741
Anything to avoid
his day in court.

1554
01:22:33,115 --> 01:22:35,961
Yo, folks, what do we
got on the tube, here?

1555
01:22:35,985 --> 01:22:38,797
Uh, rough news footage
from the night of the murder.

1556
01:22:38,821 --> 01:22:40,132
Fifteenth time.

1557
01:22:40,156 --> 01:22:41,899
What did you find
out at the hotel?

1558
01:22:41,923 --> 01:22:44,069
None of the staff saw him leave.

1559
01:22:44,093 --> 01:22:47,105
That means we have to go
through the entire guest list.

1560
01:22:47,129 --> 01:22:48,707
That could take weeks.

1561
01:22:48,731 --> 01:22:50,141
Let's see it again.

1562
01:22:50,165 --> 01:22:51,643
Ready?

1563
01:22:51,667 --> 01:22:52,787
Hold it right there.

1564
01:22:53,768 --> 01:22:55,147
Now, you see the exit sign

1565
01:22:55,171 --> 01:22:57,415
behind Lockwood, there?

1566
01:22:57,439 --> 01:22:58,550
Maybe some of the people there

1567
01:22:58,574 --> 01:23:00,218
saw him slip out
or come back in.

1568
01:23:00,242 --> 01:23:01,986
No, no, we don't know
who all those people are.

1569
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:03,010
Yeah.

1570
01:23:04,513 --> 01:23:06,191
Let me see all
this just once more.

1571
01:23:06,215 --> 01:23:08,293
I got a feeling there's
something we're overlooking.

1572
01:23:08,317 --> 01:23:09,883
One more time, real quick.

1573
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:12,564
All right, hold that one.

1574
01:23:15,724 --> 01:23:16,764
Now that one.

1575
01:23:19,261 --> 01:23:20,261
Now, here.

1576
01:23:39,715 --> 01:23:41,214
Of course.

1577
01:23:42,351 --> 01:23:44,017
It was there all the time.

1578
01:23:45,287 --> 01:23:47,565
All right.

1579
01:23:47,589 --> 01:23:50,469
Let's do put
Mr. Lockwood on the stand.

1580
01:23:50,493 --> 01:23:53,672
Mr. Lockwood, you are chairman

1581
01:23:53,696 --> 01:23:56,775
of the Land Development
Commission, is that correct?

1582
01:23:56,799 --> 01:23:59,010
Yes, it is.

1583
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:01,713
Is there currently
under deliberation,

1584
01:24:01,737 --> 01:24:05,349
uh, a petition to grant
a zoning variance

1585
01:24:05,373 --> 01:24:10,121
to something called the Georgia
Coastal Development Company?

1586
01:24:10,145 --> 01:24:11,990
Yes, there is.

1587
01:24:12,014 --> 01:24:14,459
Why do they want the variance?

1588
01:24:14,483 --> 01:24:17,428
This group of developers
is hoping to build a resort

1589
01:24:17,452 --> 01:24:20,220
on what has been restricted
beachfront property.

1590
01:24:21,256 --> 01:24:22,634
Are you aware

1591
01:24:22,658 --> 01:24:26,304
that the Georgia Coastal
Development Company

1592
01:24:26,328 --> 01:24:31,876
is a subsidiary of American
Unified Finance Corporation?

1593
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:34,012
I didn't bring documentation

1594
01:24:34,036 --> 01:24:35,613
regarding these
matters with me...

1595
01:24:35,637 --> 01:24:38,216
Your Honor, I object on
the grounds of relevancy.

1596
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:41,018
Ahem, Your Honor, I
will prove the relevancy

1597
01:24:41,042 --> 01:24:43,154
with this line of questioning.

1598
01:24:43,178 --> 01:24:44,589
Overruled.

1599
01:24:44,613 --> 01:24:46,191
Thank you.

1600
01:24:46,215 --> 01:24:50,428
Now, I have here a list

1601
01:24:50,452 --> 01:24:52,097
of the board of directors

1602
01:24:52,121 --> 01:24:54,666
of American Unified.

1603
01:24:54,690 --> 01:24:58,236
Are you aware that at least
four of these board members

1604
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:01,373
are currently under
federal indictment

1605
01:25:01,397 --> 01:25:02,841
for income tax evasion?

1606
01:25:02,865 --> 01:25:04,643
No, I am not.

1607
01:25:04,667 --> 01:25:08,880
And do you realize
that those same men

1608
01:25:08,904 --> 01:25:10,782
have long criminal records?

1609
01:25:10,806 --> 01:25:12,416
No.

1610
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:14,519
Now, Mr. Lockwood,

1611
01:25:14,543 --> 01:25:18,656
you had a close,
personal relationship

1612
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:22,394
with Linda Coolidge,
is that correct?

1613
01:25:22,418 --> 01:25:23,828
We were to be married.

1614
01:25:23,852 --> 01:25:25,752
Did you have a key
to her apartment?

1615
01:25:27,056 --> 01:25:28,288
Yes, I did.

1616
01:25:30,292 --> 01:25:34,839
Now, Mr. Lockwood,
the night of the murder

1617
01:25:34,863 --> 01:25:38,476
you were at a fundraising
dinner downtown.

1618
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:39,811
Yes.

1619
01:25:39,835 --> 01:25:41,412
Were you there all evening?

1620
01:25:41,436 --> 01:25:44,615
I left when I received word
that Linda had been shot.

1621
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:47,318
I was asked to
identify the body.

1622
01:25:47,342 --> 01:25:48,820
But you didn't
leave before that?

1623
01:25:48,844 --> 01:25:50,355
No.

1624
01:25:50,379 --> 01:25:52,079
Your Honor,

1625
01:25:53,515 --> 01:25:57,061
we have some
audio-visual material

1626
01:25:57,085 --> 01:25:59,397
that's pertinent
to this witness.

1627
01:25:59,421 --> 01:26:02,233
May we have permission
to bring it into the court?

1628
01:26:02,257 --> 01:26:04,569
Your Honor, this
entire line of questioning

1629
01:26:04,593 --> 01:26:05,837
is totally irrelevant.

1630
01:26:05,861 --> 01:26:10,742
I will demonstrate the
relevancy with the demonstration.

1631
01:26:10,766 --> 01:26:13,044
Overruled.

1632
01:26:13,068 --> 01:26:14,568
This'll just take a minute.

1633
01:26:19,909 --> 01:26:21,786
Now, on this first screen,

1634
01:26:21,810 --> 01:26:26,246
we're gonna see news footage
taken at the fundraising dinner.

1635
01:26:27,082 --> 01:26:28,122
Hold it right there.

1636
01:26:29,618 --> 01:26:31,829
And on the second screen,

1637
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:33,665
we'll see more news footage

1638
01:26:33,689 --> 01:26:35,133
in front of the
decedent's apartment

1639
01:26:35,157 --> 01:26:37,124
the night of the murder.

1640
01:26:38,693 --> 01:26:42,140
Okay... hold it right there.

1641
01:26:42,164 --> 01:26:43,841
See? There he is.

1642
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:46,844
Going in to identify the body.

1643
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:48,546
On the third screen,

1644
01:26:48,570 --> 01:26:51,316
more news footage
of Mr. Lockwood

1645
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:54,519
coming out later, after
identifying the body.

1646
01:26:54,543 --> 01:26:55,553
Freeze it, Tyler.

1647
01:26:55,577 --> 01:26:57,655
Your Honor, I-I still fail

1648
01:26:57,679 --> 01:26:59,690
to see the
relevance of all this.

1649
01:26:59,714 --> 01:27:00,825
Counsel for the defense

1650
01:27:00,849 --> 01:27:02,693
is indulging in his
well-known habit

1651
01:27:02,717 --> 01:27:05,496
of turning a courtroom
into a sideshow.

1652
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:08,766
Your Honor, this is
crucial to our defense.

1653
01:27:08,790 --> 01:27:11,135
If you'll bear with me
a few more minutes.

1654
01:27:11,159 --> 01:27:13,438
Overruled.

1655
01:27:13,462 --> 01:27:15,807
Mr. Lockwood,

1656
01:27:15,831 --> 01:27:18,343
isn't it true that you slipped
out of that banquet unseen?

1657
01:27:18,367 --> 01:27:19,877
No.

1658
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:22,047
And didn't you go to
Linda Coolidge's apartment,

1659
01:27:22,071 --> 01:27:25,416
where you argued with her
over exposing your connection

1660
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:28,085
to organized crime through
a proposed news story

1661
01:27:28,109 --> 01:27:30,055
with Steve Emerson? No.

1662
01:27:30,079 --> 01:27:31,689
Didn't you struggle
with her and kill her?

1663
01:27:31,713 --> 01:27:32,957
Absolutely not.

1664
01:27:32,981 --> 01:27:34,280
But Mr. Lockwood,

1665
01:27:35,784 --> 01:27:38,362
you see, here at the banquet
you were wearing a name tag

1666
01:27:38,386 --> 01:27:40,598
like the other guests.

1667
01:27:40,622 --> 01:27:42,767
When you went to her
apartment to identify the body,

1668
01:27:42,791 --> 01:27:44,869
you were not wearing a name tag.

1669
01:27:44,893 --> 01:27:46,203
However, when
you came out again,

1670
01:27:46,227 --> 01:27:48,005
you were wearing
a name tag again.

1671
01:27:48,029 --> 01:27:50,908
You know what I think?

1672
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:53,144
I think during the
struggle with her,

1673
01:27:53,168 --> 01:27:54,679
before you killed her,

1674
01:27:54,703 --> 01:27:57,348
that name tag
came off your suit.

1675
01:27:57,372 --> 01:27:59,350
And when you came
back, as you say,

1676
01:27:59,374 --> 01:28:01,086
to identify the body,

1677
01:28:01,110 --> 01:28:04,088
you found that name
tag and put it back,

1678
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:08,026
which is why you are
wearing it right there.

1679
01:28:16,758 --> 01:28:18,536
I'm not on trial here.

1680
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:20,093
You got that part right.

1681
01:28:21,530 --> 01:28:23,675
I don't have to prove
your guilt here and now.

1682
01:28:23,699 --> 01:28:26,745
I leave that in the skillful
hands of the prosecution.

1683
01:28:26,769 --> 01:28:29,714
They'll find somebody who
saw you leave that dinner.

1684
01:28:29,738 --> 01:28:33,318
They may even find somebody
who saw you near Emerson's car

1685
01:28:33,342 --> 01:28:35,241
when you put the gun there.

1686
01:28:36,978 --> 01:28:38,356
I just have to show this jury

1687
01:28:38,380 --> 01:28:40,325
that there's more than
a reasonable doubt

1688
01:28:40,349 --> 01:28:43,794
that Steve Emerson
committed this crime.

1689
01:28:43,818 --> 01:28:47,399
And I suppose we have
you to thank for that.

1690
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:53,440
No further questions,
Your Honor.

1691
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:12,156
We find the
defendant not guilty.

1692
01:29:15,951 --> 01:29:17,911
Congratulations, Mr. Emerson.

1693
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:20,387
Mr. Matlock.

1694
01:29:24,526 --> 01:29:25,592
Excuse me.

1695
01:29:28,964 --> 01:29:31,108
Congratulations, Mr. Emerson.
Can we have a statement?

1696
01:29:31,132 --> 01:29:33,210
This is obviously
a great day for me

1697
01:29:33,234 --> 01:29:34,311
and for the press in general.

1698
01:29:34,335 --> 01:29:36,413
I mean, we were
right down to the wire,

1699
01:29:36,437 --> 01:29:37,615
but we pulled it out.

1700
01:29:37,639 --> 01:29:39,083
You...? You have any plans now?

1701
01:29:39,107 --> 01:29:41,720
All I wanna do right now is I
want to get back to New York,

1702
01:29:41,744 --> 01:29:43,455
and I wanna get back to work.

1703
01:29:43,479 --> 01:29:44,956
Excuse me, miss.

1704
01:29:44,980 --> 01:29:47,091
You don't think this
will have any effect

1705
01:29:47,115 --> 01:29:49,561
on your returning to your show?
- I hope not.

1706
01:29:49,585 --> 01:29:51,696
What about the case? Do you
think Matlock did a good job?

1707
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:53,531
- Yes, I do.
- What about rumors

1708
01:29:53,555 --> 01:29:54,699
of you and Matlock's daughter?

1709
01:29:54,723 --> 01:29:56,389
No comment.

1710
01:30:00,695 --> 01:30:02,340
Tyler, you coming?

1711
01:30:02,364 --> 01:30:03,644
Yo.

1712
01:30:07,702 --> 01:30:10,181
Well, this probably
won't be on TV tomorrow,

1713
01:30:10,205 --> 01:30:13,317
but I know what a great
job the both of you did,

1714
01:30:13,341 --> 01:30:15,453
so I'm taking you to dinner.

1715
01:30:15,477 --> 01:30:17,355
All right. Where are we going?

1716
01:30:17,379 --> 01:30:19,424
Santino's. Santino's?

1717
01:30:19,448 --> 01:30:21,091
That's some kind of
pickup joint, ain't it?

1718
01:30:21,115 --> 01:30:23,127
No, it's where we
yuppies go to unwind.

1719
01:30:23,151 --> 01:30:25,095
Yeah, haven't you ever
seen a beer commercial?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
