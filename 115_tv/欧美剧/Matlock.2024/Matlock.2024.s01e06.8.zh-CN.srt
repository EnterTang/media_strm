1
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,878
I didn't kill Cynthia.

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,838
First thing we have to do
is find you some privacy.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,709
I mean, there he was undressing and
he hadn't even asked me my name.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,757
- In fact, I've got a bonus for you.
- Oh, yeah?

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,470
Benjamin Matlock for the defence,
Your Honour.

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,959
You wanna fall in love first?

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,678
How much is this gonna cost me?

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,398
Your Honour,
I apologise for being late.

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,312
I was unavoidably detained.

10
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,795
Now, watch this.
Bingham had plenty of time.

11
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,234
He had two receivers open deep.

12
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,992
All he had to do was scramble.

13
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,549
Five years ago, Bingham had the legs
to make that play happen,

14
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,039
but he just can't cut it anymore.

15
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,555
Let's cut our losses.

16
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,037
- Put him on waivers.
- Brad is a star, Vincent.

17
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,235
Cynthia.

18
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,995
If it keeps going like this,
it'll take years to rebuild the franchise.

19
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,037
You've got to let him go.

20
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,549
All right. I'll tell him.

21
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,189
Good.

22
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,238
We have a conference
tomorrow morning. Try to be on time.

23
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,152
Good night.

24
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,954
Marsha, it's Cynthia.

25
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,951
Well, I'm gonna have to tell him.

26
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,509
Dave and Vincent came down on me
pretty hard today,

27
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,910
and they were right.

28
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,434
I'm afraid if I trade him,
I'll never see him again.

29
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,633
Brad? Brad, what are you doing?

30
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,993
Marsha, I can't talk now.
I'll call you back tomorrow.

31
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,119
Bye.

32
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,628
Brad, did you see the champagne?

33
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,957
Brad.

34
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,909
Brad?

35
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,111
Now, Sergeant Gibbons,
you have testified

36
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,432
that you and your partner
forcibly entered Mr. Wilkins' home,

37
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,592
in an attempt to apprehend his brother.
Is that correct?

38
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,548
When he obstructed our progress,
he was given a verbal warning.

39
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,554
Some force was necessary
to continue our search.

40
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,076
During this brief struggle, did
Mr. Wilkins have any reason to believe

41
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,630
his life was threatened, so he may
have been acting in self-defence?

42
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,153
No, sir.

43
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,995
- How tall was your partner?
- About 6'3''.

44
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,037
- About your size?
- Yes.

45
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,429
Well, isn't it true, sergeant,

46
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,831
that during
this so-called brief struggle,

47
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,949
your partner struck Mr. Wilkins
on the head with his pistol?

48
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,429
He barely touched him.

49
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,910
This is a plaster mould
of Mr. Wilkins' head.

50
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,119
You're wearing your revolver?

51
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,869
Yes.

52
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,553
Demonstrate for the court
how and where

53
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,950
your partner struck him.

54
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,238
No further questions.

55
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,553
No kidding.
Well, that is interesting.

56
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,756
Yeah, I'll get right on that.

57
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,115
Yeah, thanks, Sarah. Bye.

58
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,199
- Morning.
- Morning.

59
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,396
- Hi.
- Hi.

60
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,236
Judge Cook gave me a contingence on
the Ramsey case. How about you?

61
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,197
Bradford is taking my motion
under advisement.

62
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,510
I think I caught him a little off guard.

63
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,717
And also, I changed the deposition on
the Oppelman matter to Wednesday,

64
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,872
so I told Sarah to reschedule
your dental appointment.

65
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,149
- Charlene?
- Yeah?

66
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,551
One of the advantages to having
your daughter as a law partner,

67
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,156
is that keen attention is paid
to every detail of your life.

68
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,551
At least, I think it's an advantage.

69
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,631
I don't know how
you got through life without me.

70
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,949
Yeah.

71
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,592
Did you hear
that Cynthia Hyland was murdered?

72
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,193
- Yeah.
- The suspect is none other

73
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,079
than fading quarterback
Brad Bingham.

74
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,276
He goes through women
like a whale through plankton.

75
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,590
Only maybe this time,
I think he went a little too far.

76
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,749
Maybe.

77
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,229
I heard he was sleeping with her
so she wouldn't trade him.

78
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,437
I also heard that
she was gonna trade him anyway.

79
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,795
Wanna find out for yourself?

80
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,634
Can't you get me out of here?
I didn't kill Cynthia.

81
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,155
Mr. Bingham,
tell us what happened last night.

82
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,914
Nothing. There's nothing to tell.
I didn't do anything.

83
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,958
I swear to God, I didn't do anything.

84
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,232
I heard a scream,

85
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,313
and I saw Brad Bingham hit some lady
at about five past 1 1 last night.

86
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,439
- That's when I called the police.
- You saw this through your telescope.

87
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,398
His apartment's
one block over from ours.

88
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,348
You know, in the summer,
the moon comes up right behind it.

89
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,317
That's how I discovered he lived there.

90
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,552
Looking for craters and, you know,
through my telescope.

91
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,518
And you were not in your apartment
at 1 1 :00 last evening.

92
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,795
No.

93
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,234
- You're sure?
- Yes.

94
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,516
If I'd known Cynthia
was gonna be at my apartment,

95
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,079
I would have been.

96
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,959
Thinking you were gonna be alone
that night, you went out to a bar.

97
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,270
Listen, there was a brownout
that whole afternoon.

98
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,158
I went out for some air conditioning.

99
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,153
And you picked up some woman
whose name you can't remember.

100
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,391
Her name was Carol.

101
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,116
Carrie, maybe, or Cory or Candy.

102
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,032
I don't know.
I know it started with a C.

103
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,156
You met her at the Peachtree Bar,
struck up a conversation and then?

104
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,354
Then we went back to her hotel and--

105
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,033
One thing led to another?

106
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,478
- Yeah.
- All night?

107
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,958
All night.

108
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,632
You were not in your apartment
at any time last night.

109
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,038
No, sir.

110
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,997
Yes, sir.
He was right there.

111
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,913
Cynthia interrupted our conversation
to say something to him.

112
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,036
Do you remember what time that was,
Miss Barnes?

113
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,474
Eleven o'clock.

114
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,596
She was calling to tell me about Brad.

115
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,948
What about him?

116
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,112
She was going to tell Brad
they were going to put him on waivers.

117
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,236
Be the end of my career.
She wouldn't do that.

118
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,791
Well, I guess the first thing for us
to do is speak to the police.

119
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,793
To see if they talked
to that girl you were with last night.

120
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,191
- Are you gonna get me out of here?
- I'm gonna try.

121
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,592
- That's really a shame.
- What?

122
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,275
I was at the Super Bowl
the year he threw the pass.

123
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,431
Sixty yards in the air
for the winning touchdown.

124
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,669
He was really something.

125
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,116
- Everybody was crazy over him.
- That was then, old timer.

126
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,556
- I figured we would be seeing you two.
- How's that?

127
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,435
If we bring in a grossly overpaid
professional athlete,

128
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,397
I expect to find you all in the vicinity.

129
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,191
Lieutenant,
I understand Brad Bingham told you

130
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,272
he was with a young woman last night
at the Somerset Hotel.

131
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,431
- He did.
- Have you talked with her?

132
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,680
I think you'd better step inside.

133
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,199
As a matter of fact, have a seat.

134
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,112
- Have you found the lady?
- No.

135
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,430
And believe me, my men tried.

136
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,431
She doesn't exist. He made her up.

137
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,352
What makes you so certain?

138
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,039
Because I got a witness who can place
Brad Bingham in his apartment

139
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,270
at 1 1 :00 last night
with Cynthia Hyland.

140
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,591
And another one who saw him
kill her

141
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,876
with a blow to the head
a few minutes later.

142
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,591
So, if Bingham is your client,
I guess congratulations are in order.

143
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,395
I'm about to arrest him
for first degree murder.

144
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,832
Has it crossed your mind
your football hero might be a liar?

145
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,592
Lieutenant Davis has an eyewitness.

146
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,751
Brad Bingham has an alibi.

147
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,638
So he says.

148
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,872
First thing we have to do
is find you some privacy.

149
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,315
Tyler, I'm sorry
to barge in on you like this,

150
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,710
but we've got
a small emergency on our hands.

151
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,030
Ben, can we do this
some other time?

152
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,111
- This is Brad Bingham.
- Hi.

153
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,158
Look, Ben, I'm busy right now.
I'm very busy.

154
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,435
Doing what?

155
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,990
Even to the untrained eye, it would
appear that I'm painting my apartment.

156
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,509
Why?

157
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,275
Because I finally got Cecily to agree
to come over to my place for dinner,

158
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,034
and I'm painting the place
her favourite colour, French Vanilla,

159
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,633
just to set the stage.

160
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,156
Brad is one of the all-time football
greats. You know him, don't you?

161
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,309
Of course.

162
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,948
I'm defending him against
a charge of murder in first degree.

163
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,109
I need your help.

164
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,111
You're my investigator.
It's as simple as that.

165
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,349
Yeah, but why are you here?

166
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,317
He needs a place to lay low
for a while.

167
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,119
- I don't wanna be a problem.
- No problem. Come by the office.

168
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,794
First thing in the morning.
I've got something I want you to do.

169
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,158
Help yourself.

170
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,759
Pretty. Pretty.

171
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,435
Yes, of course you're pretty. Yes.

172
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,194
Well, what's this?

173
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,793
Isn't he beautiful?

174
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,315
A friend of a friend of mine
gave him to me.

175
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,751
She moved to Des Moines.

176
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,039
- He is so beautiful.
- What's his name?

177
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,232
P.T. Bridgeport.

178
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,834
What a grand name.

179
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,991
Well, P.T., I wish you Godspeed.

180
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,197
And of course, Sarah,
Godspeed to you too.

181
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,271
Oh, thank you, Ben.

182
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,999
Well, any luck finding the girl
Bingham spent the night with?

183
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,559
Nope.

184
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,154
I spent the afternoon talking
to all the women who registered

185
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,595
at the Somerset Hotel
whose name began with a C.

186
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,877
No luck. And then I went to the place
where he said he picked her up.

187
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,393
No luck there, either.

188
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,152
Nobody there saw him
talking to anybody?

189
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,231
They saw him talking to everyone.

190
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,551
The waitress said he was gone by 1 0,
but didn't actually see him leave.

191
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,071
Maybe you should try that hotel again.

192
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,194
I suppose so.

193
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,551
He was quite a womanizer, huh?

194
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,599
I'd say so.

195
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,197
Well, just because he's a womanizer
doesn't mean he killed anybody.

196
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,590
I think I'll go over to team headquarters
in the morning

197
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,036
and talk to some of the people
Cynthia Hyland worked with.

198
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,758
See you in the morning.

199
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,277
See you in the morning.

200
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,599
Hi.

201
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,916
Mr. Hyland, I'm Ben Matlock,

202
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,752
Brad Bingham's lawyer.

203
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,114
Yes.

204
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,158
I know what a tragedy
this must be for you.

205
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,039
Your stepmother being killed
like this.

206
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,393
We have strong reason to believe

207
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,994
that Brad Bingham is innocent
of this crime.

208
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,674
- The police don't seem to think so.
<i>- I know, I know.</i>

209
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,319
What is it you want?

210
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,516
I'd like to take a look
at Ms. Hyland's appointment book.

211
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,115
And if I say no?

212
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,590
I'd understand that, but I'd get
a subpoena and look at it anyway.

213
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,320
You don't have a personal problem
with my looking at it, do you?

214
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,994
- Of course not.
- Thank you.

215
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,275
You know, I've been a loyal fan
of this team for 1 5 years.

216
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,069
I sure hope you don't sell to somebody
that'll move it to another town.

217
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,039
Who said I was gonna sell?

218
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,589
Oh, it's probably just talk.

219
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,274
What talk?

220
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,758
Just gossip how you and Ms. Hyland
didn't get along.

221
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,876
How she had demoted you
to selling season tickets.

222
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,349
And how in your father's will,
if anything happened to her,

223
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,112
you would get her
share of the franchise,

224
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,078
and how you would sell her interest
if you inherited it.

225
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,071
Just that sort of thing.

226
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,471
- I pay no attention to it.
- What are you insinuating?

227
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,435
I'm not insinuating anything.

228
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,352
But I suppose you did have
a strong motive to kill Ms. Hyland.

229
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,069
Mr. Matlock,
I suggest you get the hell out of here.

230
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,913
I guess I have taken up
enough of your time.

231
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,469
Thank you for your cooperation.

232
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,759
- I didn't know you were busy.
- Oh, I was just leaving.

233
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,193
You must be Dave Edwards.

234
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,316
- Ben Matlock.
- How do you do?

235
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,629
Bingham's attorney.

236
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,711
We were just discussing the case.

237
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,713
If you wanna talk to me, you can
talk to me through my attorney.

238
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,556
Let's hope that won't be necessary.

239
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,999
- Hi.
- Yes?

240
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,549
- Karen Nelson?
- That's right.

241
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,233
I'm Charlene Matlock.

242
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,992
I'm an attorney
representing Brad Bingham,

243
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,038
and he says he was with you
the other night.

244
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,118
Come on in.

245
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,750
I drove in that morning.

246
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,876
I'd been shopping
for clients all afternoon.

247
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,759
Oh, these are nice.

248
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,399
Thanks.

249
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,551
And then I stopped someplace
to have a drink.

250
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,671
That's when l--

251
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:03,668
See, the trouble is I'm engaged, and
if my fianc‚ ever finds out, he'll kill me.

252
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,637
Karen, you've got to tell me.

253
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,358
Well, Brad was there

254
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,875
and he started hitting on me.

255
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,791
There he was, this famous
football player hitting on me.

256
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,471
And then he suggested
we go to my hotel room.

257
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,030
And I said sure.

258
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,990
How could I refuse?

259
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,596
So, he was with you.

260
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,354
Well, right up until I realised
what a drunken lech he was

261
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,670
and what a mistake I'd made.

262
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,035
So, I came to my senses
and threw him out the door.

263
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,270
Are you saying
he didn't spend the night with you?

264
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,635
No, he was here
for all of five minutes.

265
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,351
I mean, there he was undressing and
he hadn't even asked me my name.

266
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,748
Can you believe it?

267
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,238
She was lying.

268
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,912
I don't know what to say.

269
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,072
Nothing corroborates your story,
not one thing.

270
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,639
Man!

271
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,118
This is a nightmare.

272
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,431
This woman told you she spent the day
shopping before she met Brad?

273
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,157
- Shopping downtown?
- That's what she said, yes.

274
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,233
Wait a minute.
That was the day of the brownout.

275
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,277
The stores downtown were closed.

276
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:30,672
She may have been in town, but I have
serious doubts that she was shopping.

277
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,433
Karen?

278
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,070
I was here less than an hour ago.

279
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,710
She must've packed up and left
as soon as I talked to her.

280
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,838
Unless talking to me
is what she intended--

281
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,711
Oh, my God.

282
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,517
She was framing my client,

283
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,473
and I fell for it.

284
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,153
Come!

285
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,113
Ben.

286
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,316
- I have a problem.
- What's the matter?

287
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,755
Your mother's a jackass.
Your mother's a jackass.

288
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,268
What do you think?

289
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,756
I think he said
your mother's a jackass.

290
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,673
Ben, I don't know what to do.

291
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,513
My mother's never been the most
secure person in the world, anyway,

292
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,830
and if she should stop by and <i>P.T.--</i>

293
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,833
- Said your mother's a jackass.
- I think I'd die.

294
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,960
I've asked everybody I know
and nobody'll take him.

295
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,192
And if P.T. ended up in the pound--

296
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,713
I know.

297
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,199
Is there anyone you know?

298
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,079
Well,

299
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,117
Herman Jones thinks
his mother-in-law's a jackass.

300
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,479
Leave him.
I'll check some of my contacts.

301
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,710
Ben, I'm sorry.

302
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,796
I'm really sorry.

303
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,394
- Bye.
- Bye.

304
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,553
What's this?

305
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,513
Your mother's a jackass.
Your mother's a jackass.

306
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,874
You got anything good?

307
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,471
I sent a copy of Karen Nelson's
hotel bill to Jimmy

308
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,278
down at the phone company.

309
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,432
He's gonna track down all the calls
she made from her hotel room.

310
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,874
Good.

311
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,839
Dad, I feel terrible.

312
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,630
You know. I was defending
a fellow named Leroy Harding

313
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,075
on a murder charge over in Athens.

314
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,390
This harried old lady swore she was
with Leroy the night of the murder.

315
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,358
She reminded me
of your grandmother.

316
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,715
I barely listened to her story,

317
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,189
never bothered to check it out,
and it never occurred to me

318
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,191
that she was lying, which she was.

319
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,557
I looked like a red-faced fool when
the DA impeached her on the stand,

320
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,439
so I guess I know how you feel.

321
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,919
Did that really happen?

322
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,676
Charlene, I'm your father.

323
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,913
Thanks.

324
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,269
What'll it be sir?

325
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,953
I'm looking for Johnny Mack.

326
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,873
Hey, I just make the drinks, pal.
I don't make the introductions.

327
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,634
Look, Brad Bingham
said I should come to see you.

328
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,870
Hey, I don't care
what Brad Bingham said, all right?

329
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,868
You want to see me?

330
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,714
I bet you're Johnny Mack.

331
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,348
Tyler Hudson's my name.
I work for Brad Bingham's attorney.

332
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,431
I'd just like to ask you
a few questions.

333
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,556
- About what?
- He's in a lot of trouble.

334
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,030
- He could use your help.
- I've got trouble of my own.

335
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,757
You know,
he told me that you was his friend.

336
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,480
I guess I'd better
go straighten him out about that.

337
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,673
Let's talk.

338
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,559
- Hi.
- Hi.

339
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,995
I'm afraid Tyler's not here right now.

340
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,276
Actually, I came to see you.

341
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,272
Come in.

342
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,798
Ben told you about Karen Nelson?

343
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,393
Yeah.

344
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,792
Brad, I'm so sorry.

345
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,234
I should've known she was lying,

346
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,597
but her story attracted all my
preconceptions of you, and...

347
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,954
that's why I believed her.

348
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,553
Preconceptions?

349
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,873
Remember Ellen Halley?

350
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,669
Yeah.

351
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,628
She was my friend.

352
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,797
You know what she tried to do
when you left her?

353
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,434
I tried to call her,
and she wouldn't talk to me.

354
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,192
You never heard about that,
did you?

355
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,157
- No.
- Well, it's the truth.

356
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,395
Do you believe me?

357
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,354
Yes.

358
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,709
Thanks.

359
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,797
Remember this jacket?

360
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:36,270
This and this is thanks
to your good buddy, Johnny Mack.

361
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,228
Seems Johnny's got a pair
of bad knees from blocking for you.

362
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,550
It'll probably cut two years
off his career.

363
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,190
Yeah? Well, he sure doesn't wanna
be going public about helping you.

364
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,590
Well if they found out about this
they could drop him.

365
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,116
Oh, he dropped me
on a table and down a hall--

366
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,794
Tyler. Did he say anything?

367
00:22:55,560 --> 00:23:00,759
Yeah, one, Dave Edwards had a thing
with Cynthia before you came along.

368
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,753
Two, Dave Edwards
want to buy the team real bad.

369
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,309
And three, there's no three.
That's all we've got.

370
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,674
Cynthia was going on
about eventually selling her interest.

371
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,717
Are you suggesting
a motive for murder?

372
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,269
There's a lot of money involved.

373
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,637
- I'll check it out in the morning. I got it.
- I could do that.

374
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,110
And anyway, Tyler,
you look like you need the rest.

375
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,068
See you tomorrow.

376
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,238
See you later.

377
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:37,158
Well, I got to tell you, Bingham,
I couldn't have done better myself.

378
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,758
- Your mail.
- Thanks a lot. Any messages?

379
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,150
One. Cecily called.

380
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,393
Cancelled.

381
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,918
So you were tracing
the rings of Saturn for this report.

382
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,069
You heard a scream,

383
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,835
turned your telescope around, and saw
Mr. Bingham strike Mrs. Hyland.

384
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,319
That's right.

385
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,278
Boy, that must be
some powerful telescope you have.

386
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,192
Two-inch parabolic mirror,

387
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,672
tripod-mounted,
with 650-inch focal length.

388
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,759
Is it difficult to operate?

389
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,079
Well, you use the pilot scope
to train on a general field of view.

390
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,791
You lock down the tripod head,
and you find focus,

391
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,029
and that's all there is.

392
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,109
You say you turned this report in
after Mrs. Hyland was murdered.

393
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,919
Some time around then, yeah.

394
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,670
I stopped by your school, Gerald.

395
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,752
You turned the report in
three weeks before the murder.

396
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,075
Your teacher said you're
one of his brightest students.

397
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,356
Kind of shy, though.

398
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,592
He said the other kids
don't pay much attention.

399
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,079
I bet they do now.

400
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,479
Yeah.

401
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,515
Now.

402
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,035
What is it you really saw, Gerald?

403
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,679
You heard a scream.

404
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,109
Yes.

405
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,317
- Ran to your telescope.
- Yes.

406
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,630
- Took off the lens cap.
- Yes.

407
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,031
- Unlocked it?
- Yes.

408
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,715
Turned it toward the sound,
did all the focusing you described,

409
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,075
and then after you'd done that,

410
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,076
you really didn't see him strike her,
did you?

411
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,673
Well, she was laying on the ground.

412
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,068
Where was the man?

413
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,038
Going towards the door.

414
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,792
With his back to you?

415
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,349
Yes.

416
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,272
So, since it was
Brad Bingham's apartment,

417
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,908
you naturally assumed
that's who you saw.

418
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,835
I guess.

419
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,150
You know, Gerald,

420
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,757
about all we
can do in life is give it our best shot.

421
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,592
Maybe some don't pay attention
to you now,

422
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,593
but I read your reports good.
You'll be okay.

423
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,636
Just give it your best shot.

424
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,274
No further questions.

425
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,598
- Excuse me.
- One moment, please.

426
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,599
- May I help you?
- I'd like to see Dave Edwards.

427
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,149
- Your name?
- Charlene Matlock.

428
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,951
I'm sorry, he--

429
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,311
Mr. Edwards. Mr. Edwards!

430
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,870
She took the cartridge.

431
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,871
Hold the elevator.

432
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,828
She was telling me that they
were going to have to trade Brad,

433
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,956
and she was worried
how he'd take it.

434
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,351
- And then what happened?
- She said, ''Brad?

435
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,557
Brad, what are you doing?''
Something like that.

436
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,153
What time did she call you?

437
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,959
Eleven o'clock on the dot.

438
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:06,509
That's about five minutes before
whoever was in the apartment with her

439
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,238
bludgeoned her to death.

440
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,072
Your witness.

441
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,549
Miss Barnes, you say the phone
rang at eleven o'clock on the dot.

442
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,190
Were you expecting Cynthia Hyland
to call you then?

443
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,750
No. The news came on TV
while we were talking.

444
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,114
The music's very distinctive.

445
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,156
Did you hear this sound

446
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,756
while you were talking
with Cynthia over the phone?

447
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,434
No.

448
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,434
Your Honour,
I fail to see the relevancy of any of this.

449
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,431
Overruled for now.

450
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,196
The sound you heard was a clock
in Brad Bingham's apartment.

451
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,793
If Cynthia had called from there,

452
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,396
Miss Barnes would've heard it
strike 1 1 over the phone.

453
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,715
Now, Miss Barnes,
did you also hear this sound

454
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,314
while you were talking with Cynthia.

455
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,400
Maybe it would help if I tell you
that it's the sound

456
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,949
of water running into a bathtub.

457
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,712
I do remember hearing that
because I remember thinking,

458
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,519
''Imagine that.
He has a phone in his bathroom.''

459
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:27,677
Now, Miss Barnes, this is a diagram
of Brad Bingham's apartment.

460
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:33,353
Now, this is the bathroom, this is
the bathtub, this is the telephone.

461
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,397
Now, from where Cynthia Hyland had
to be in order to use the telephone,

462
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,120
she can't see out into the apartment.

463
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,554
Yes, I see.

464
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,280
What was it you heard her say?

465
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,953
''Brad?

466
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,156
Brad, what are you doing?''

467
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,869
Kind of a silly thing for her to ask
if they were face to face, isn't it?

468
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,429
I suppose so.

469
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,318
Well, what if they weren't
face to face?

470
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,469
What if it was her way

471
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:02,668
of asking somebody she could hear
but not see to identify himself?

472
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,079
We don't know for a fact that Brad
Bingham was in the apartment at all.

473
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,272
Thank you, Miss Barnes. That's all.

474
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,516
Not. Not.

475
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,513
Your mother's not a jackass.

476
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,069
How's it going?

477
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,038
- Your mother's a jackass.
- About the same.

478
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,349
What have you got?

479
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,114
Well, it took a bit of decoding,
but it's all here.

480
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,157
Vincent Hyland is selling
his share of the team,

481
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,153
formerly the property of
Cynthia Hyland, to David T. Edwards

482
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,517
for the sum
of 35 million dollars in cash.

483
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,991
Vince Hyland has 35 million.

484
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,037
Dave Edwards has the team.

485
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,555
We can't tie either one of them
to the girl in the hotel.

486
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,075
Ben, have I got news for you.

487
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:53,392
I checked the address out on our lady
at the hotel, and it's a phoney.

488
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,677
But while she was there, she made
several calls to an escort service,

489
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:00,833
and this particular one
offers full service, if you get my drift.

490
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,872
Karen Nelson is a call girl?

491
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,634
Triple digit.

492
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,516
You have contacts around town,
don't you?

493
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,713
Depends on what you want.

494
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,355
A date.

495
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,993
Come on in.

496
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,550
- Hi.
- Hi.

497
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,155
- Karen, right?
- That's right.

498
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,392
My name's Ben.

499
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,399
Help yourself to a drink, Karen.

500
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,913
Thank you.

501
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,356
Where are you from, Ben?

502
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,117
I'm local.

503
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,477
- Georgia born and raised.
- No kidding.

504
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,315
- How about you?
- I'm from all over.

505
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,835
But you're here in Atlanta now.

506
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,270
Yeah, I'm here now

507
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,035
and the meter's running, Ben.

508
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,878
That's okay.

509
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,080
I don't mind spending some time.

510
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,832
Warm up.

511
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,148
You wanna fall in love first,
huh, Ben?

512
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,192
I like to spend a little time
with somebody

513
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,920
whose voice is higher than mine.

514
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,991
You're new at this, aren't you?

515
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,752
Fairly.

516
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,433
How much is this gonna cost me?

517
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:53,119
Three hundred, as advertised.

518
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:57,717
Unless you want something special.

519
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,358
No, I like to keep things simple.

520
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,991
Then I'll be right back.

521
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,390
- Where is he?
- He'll be along.

522
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,551
All rise.

523
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,077
Is the defence ready to proceed?

524
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,315
Your Honour, my partner's been
unavoidably detained.

525
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,631
With the court's indulgence I'd like to
begin examination of our next witness

526
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,994
until he arrives.

527
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,869
- Does prosecution object?
- No, Your Honour.

528
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,511
I call Karen Nelson to the stand.

529
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,513
Ms. Nelson,
you're from out of town?

530
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,829
I have a home in Savannah.

531
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,754
But actually, I spend much, if not most,
of my time here in Atlanta.

532
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,558
And what have you been doing
in Atlanta?

533
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,278
I'm a personal shopper.

534
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,113
People pay me on an hourly basis
to design their wardrobes

535
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,874
and buy their clothes.
Women, mostly.

536
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,998
So, on the afternoon
that Cynthia Hyland was murdered,

537
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,388
you were in town.

538
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,551
- Yes.
- Shopping?

539
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,909
Yes.

540
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,348
There was a citywide electrical
brownout that day, wasn't there?

541
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,472
I don't recall.

542
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,914
At this point, defence
requests the court take judicial notice

543
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,433
that on the afternoon of the 23rd,

544
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,830
there was an electrical brownout
in the downtown district

545
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,673
and all the stores were closed.

546
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,232
Well, I was window shopping.

547
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,676
Knowing which stores carry what
is three-quarters of my job.

548
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,713
Didn't you have a chance meeting with
Brad Bingham later that afternoon,

549
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,313
at the Peachtree Bar?

550
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,469
That's right.

551
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,153
Didn't you invite him up to your room?

552
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,072
He invited himself.

553
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,037
Didn't you spend the night
with him there?

554
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,111
No.

555
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,549
Are you sure about that?

556
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,714
I made him leave
before anything happened.

557
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,759
I realised that even though he was
famous, I really didn't much like him.

558
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,956
Excuse me a minute, Your Honour.

559
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,796
Your Honour,
I apologise for being late.

560
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,951
I was unavoidably detained.

561
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,998
With your permission, I have a few
further questions for this witness.

562
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,718
Proceed, Mr. Matlock.

563
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,833
My name's Benjamin Matlock.

564
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,151
I'm one of the attorneys
for Mr. Bingham.

565
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,628
Have we ever met?

566
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,873
I'm sure I'd remember.

567
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,117
I bet you three hundred dollars
you'd remember if you tried.

568
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,399
I'm afraid you'd lose.

569
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,990
Miss Nelson--
It is Miss Nelson, isn't it?

570
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,630
- That's right.
- I remind you you're under oath.

571
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,556
Were you ever in a hotel room
with me?

572
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,879
No.

573
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:39,068
Weren't you in Room 1 007
at the Promenade Hotel last night?

574
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,198
No.

575
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,118
And you didn't accept
three hundred dollars from me?

576
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,551
I was at home.

577
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,038
Are you familiar with something called
the Gentleman's Escort Service?

578
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,634
No.

579
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,309
I see.

580
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,396
Do you know
what's really interesting?

581
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,757
I called
the Gentleman's Escort Service

582
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,753
and arranged for a young woman
named Karen

583
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,354
to come to my hotel room last night.

584
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:20,149
Now, this Karen left a fingerprint
on a drinking glass.

585
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,791
I took that fingerprint down
to the Atlanta's police department,

586
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,832
and they provided me with a rap sheet

587
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,233
on one Caroline Nathan.

588
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,233
That's your real name, isn't it?

589
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,036
Caroline, don't get in any deeper.

590
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,952
It isn't worth it.

591
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,190
You're getting in very deep.

592
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,789
Caroline is your real name, isn't it?
Caroline Nathan?

593
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,909
Yes.

594
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,593
And you were convicted
of solicitation two times

595
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,352
in the last 1 2 months,
isn't that correct?

596
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,954
Objection. Relevancy.

597
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,758
Sustained.

598
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,354
If I called the
Gentleman's Escort Service

599
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:22,991
and asked for a Karen Nelson,
I would get you, wouldn't I?

600
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,195
Yes.

601
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,832
And you were in my hotel room
last night, weren't you?

602
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,389
Yes.

603
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,959
What all did we do?

604
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,509
Nothing.

605
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,871
But you did pick up that three hundred
I left on the bed, didn't you?

606
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,149
Yes.

607
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,550
And you're not a personal shopper,
are you?

608
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,835
No.

609
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,433
And you don't have
a home in Savannah.

610
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,029
No.

611
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,192
Miss Nathan,

612
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,716
you've lied about your name,
your occupation,

613
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,313
and having met me.

614
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:10,350
Now, I remind you that the penalty
for perjury is severe,

615
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,395
and you are under oath.

616
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,234
Now,

617
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,358
let's get back
to this Brad Bingham business.

618
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:23,033
Were you with him all night
the night of the murder?

619
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,274
Now, we're not talking
about solicitation here.

620
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,159
We're talking about murder.

621
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,231
You know what I think?

622
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,278
I think you were
with him all night that night,

623
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,238
during which time
a murder was committed.

624
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,118
Then you said you were not with him

625
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,510
to make it appear
that he was the murderer.

626
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:59,877
What I don't know is whether you were
part of the plan from the beginning

627
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,396
or whether somebody gave you
a great deal of money

628
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,597
or frightened you
into saying you were not with him

629
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:10,230
by telling you you would be implicated
in this murder.

630
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,559
Well,

631
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,675
I will tell you now.

632
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,678
You are implicated in this murder.

633
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,753
Do you understand?

634
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,878
You are implicated in this murder.

635
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:30,474
Now, were you with Brad Bingham
all night, that night?

636
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,439
- Yes.
- Well, now.

637
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:48,398
Well, now, that might just
very well clear Brad Bingham.

638
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,751
But there's one more thing.

639
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,355
You know last night
when we had our little date?

640
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,431
I did something I shouldn't have done,
but I couldn't help myself.

641
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:11,188
You know, when you went
in the other room just before I left,

642
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,598
I looked in your purse

643
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:20,115
and I found this little black book.

644
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:24,035
This is the little black book
you carry in your purse, isn't it?

645
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,189
Yes.

646
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,511
- Say it again.
- Yes.

647
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,671
And it's got a lot of names in it.

648
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,513
I'm talking a lot of names.

649
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,272
Now, I won't read them off because--

650
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,672
But there's one name in here,
might be just a client,

651
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:46,590
or it might be the name of somebody
who solicited your perjured testimony.

652
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,038
Now, I'm gonna give you
an opportunity

653
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:54,239
to just wipe the slate clean
with this court.

654
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,789
Just start over.

655
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,238
I'll tell you what.

656
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:07,309
Just whisper his name to me,
see if I was right.

657
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,715
- Dave Edwards.
- I was right.

658
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,552
All right, tell them.

659
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,599
Dave Edwards.

660
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,752
Order! Order, please!

661
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,239
No further questions.

662
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:53,317
We find the defendant not guilty.

663
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,878
Mr. Edwards.

664
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,275
Would you mind
going down to headquarters?

665
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:18,798
Ben, could I see
that little black book of hers?

666
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,393
Why?

667
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,630
Is it for real?

668
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,552
Does it matter?

669
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,718
- See you, Bert.
- Ben.

670
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,355
Brad's invited us to dinner.

671
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,033
Yeah?

672
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,194
- I think I'll pass.
- Why don't you come?

673
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,636
No, I think I'll go back to the office
and see what I can do with that parrot.

674
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,633
- Have fun.
- You too.

675
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,233
Congratulations.

676
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,833
- Nice job, Tyler.
- Thank you.

677
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,230
- In fact, I've got a bonus for you.
- Oh, yeah?

678
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,153
Yeah. I don't think a young man
like you ought to live alone.

679
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:53,630
- I'm not taking that parrot.
- Just a thought.
