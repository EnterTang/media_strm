1
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,478
Sergeant!

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,279
I killed Se¤or Ward.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,630
He had an affair in my house
with my maid.

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,392
I always wondered what you looked
like when you woke up in the morning.

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,391
Charlene.

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,030
Where are all these people
who were so anxious for us to come?

7
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,869
Sonya.

8
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,473
Sonya.

9
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,189
It took a long time
for her to fall asleep.

10
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,390
Hey, here's somebody.

11
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,913
Excuse me.

12
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,431
- Please--
- Excuse me.

13
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,068
Sir, can we get a statement?

14
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,032
- Mother?
- In here.

15
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,189
Excuse me.

16
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,396
Mother, I just heard
the news on the radio.

17
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,595
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

18
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,318
Are you sure?
Anything I can do for you?

19
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,948
- Everything's under control.
- Excuse me.

20
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,993
You the stepson of the deceased?

21
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,716
I guess you could say that I was.

22
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,518
Sergeant.

23
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,997
The press are getting impatient.

24
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,878
Get a statement from him.

25
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,112
I've gotta talk to the press.
I'll be right back.

26
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,669
All right, come on over here.

27
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,029
Come on.

28
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,599
- What happened?
- Hold it, hold it.

29
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,479
Hold it! I'm gonna make this brief.

30
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,676
Richard Ward
was stabbed to death last night

31
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,149
between 1 1 and 2 a.m.

32
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,436
A full investigation
has already begun.

33
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,955
- Any suspects in custody?
- Not at this time.

34
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,680
But we're making enquiries
which we expect will lead to an arrest.

35
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,400
- What does that mean, detective?
- Can you give us any names?

36
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,396
We're not in a position
to make any further comment

37
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,595
on the case at this time.

38
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,512
What can you tell us
about the murder--?

39
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,749
- Hold it!
- I told you--

40
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,909
Sergeant!

41
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,957
Drop that knife.

42
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,912
- Ben.
- Oh, hi, Charlene.

43
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,877
- I've been looking for you.
- Yeah?

44
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,758
Sarah said you weren't
coming to the office.

45
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,150
- No, I'm going home to clean my attic.
- Why bother?

46
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,595
- You never throw anything away.
- Well, it's difficult.

47
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,671
- There's a lot of good stuff there.
- Like what?

48
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,354
A lot of good stuff.
Remember that fence stretcher I got?

49
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,748
You don't have a fence.

50
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,638
If I ever get one
and I want to stretch it,

51
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,074
I've got a fence stretcher.

52
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,719
We have a meeting
with a new client.

53
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,553
I don't want a new client.
I want to go home and clean my attic.

54
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,870
Well, she's just flown in
from Rhode Island.

55
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,029
Yeah?

56
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,553
I asked her to.

57
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,755
Why?

58
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,194
Remember my friend from college,
Clark Harrison?

59
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,590
- He was your boyfriend, wasn't he?
- Just a friend, Ben.

60
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,911
Well, his mother remarried a man
named Richard Ward.

61
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,798
Remember?

62
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,837
- The guy in the paper this morning?
- Yeah.

63
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,069
What does she want with us?

64
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,313
Well, Clark's mother, Mrs. Ward,
wants us to represent the woman

65
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,835
who's been arrested
for killing her husband.

66
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,757
Interesting, huh?

67
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,069
Yeah.

68
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,715
I don't care what it costs,
Mr. Matlock.

69
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,510
What I don't understand, Mrs. Ward,

70
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,955
is why you're willing
to spend all this money

71
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,998
to defend the person who
presumably murdered your husband.

72
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,628
That's my business, Mr. Matlock.

73
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,519
By the way, I prefer that no one
knew that I'd hired you.

74
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,398
I'm afraid I can't do that.

75
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,394
- And why not?
- Well, first of all, I don't work that way.

76
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,118
Second, people know what I get.

77
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,590
They're bound to wonder
how a maid can afford the likes of me.

78
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,751
Besides, if you really
wanna help this woman,

79
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,354
you should let everybody know
you're on her side.

80
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,839
You're very persuasive.

81
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,399
I'm supposed to be.

82
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,349
I've made reservations on this
afternoon's flight for the two of you.

83
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,080
- Clark can't wait to see you.
- I'm looking forward to it.

84
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,879
Excuse me, Mrs. Ward.
I don't think we're quite finished here.

85
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,788
Oh, I'm so sorry. Of course.

86
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,997
- You'll want a retainer.
- It's customary.

87
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,109
How much?

88
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,078
A hundred thousand dollars
should do it.

89
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,918
You're not inexpensive.

90
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,715
When I win,
I'm considered a bargain.

91
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,037
Is there anything else, Mr. Matlock?

92
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,879
- You still haven't told me.
- Told you what?

93
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,913
Why you're defending
your husband's supposed killer.

94
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,235
I have to know,
or I can't take the case.

95
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,837
Dick Ward was never exactly
faithful to me.

96
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,514
I could bear it
as long as he was discreet.

97
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,956
But now I'm in every
gossip column that there is.

98
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,590
He had an affair in my house
with my maid.

99
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,557
And I don't blame her,

100
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,551
but I can't forgive him.

101
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:38,599
I want everyone to know precisely
what kind of man he really was.

102
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,154
Thank you for telling me, Mrs. Ward.

103
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,194
I'll have my car meet you at the airport.

104
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,192
Bill Ward did all right for himself.

105
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,918
Well, this is the Harrison mansion.

106
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,150
See, he moved in with Christina.

107
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,799
Isn't it magnificent?

108
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,989
Talk about some got it
and some don't.

109
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,037
Ben, don't start. It's gonna be ideal.

110
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,111
Here we are
at the scene of the crime.

111
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,748
- I'm not staying in the maid's room.
- Well...

112
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,956
You're gonna like them.
They're wonderful people.

113
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,350
Hope they got a hard mattress.

114
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,199
- Forbes.
- Miss Matlock, nice to see you.

115
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,998
And you.

116
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,835
- I'm Ben Matlock.
- You're expected, sir.

117
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,989
Please step in.

118
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,596
Wait here, please.

119
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,076
Where are all these people who were
so anxious for us to come?

120
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,229
Yes?

121
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,119
Aunt Harriet.

122
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,430
Hello, Charlene.

123
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,600
This is my father, Ben Matlock.
Christina's Aunt Harriet.

124
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,795
How do you do?

125
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,157
To answer your question,

126
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,515
not all of us
were anxious for you to come.

127
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,396
Some of us think the idea
of your representing the woman

128
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,630
who killed my niece's husband

129
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,711
is extremely distasteful.

130
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,713
I happen to be one of those people.

131
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,711
My niece is not at home
at the moment.

132
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,348
However, we're all dining in
this evening.

133
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,592
The dress is informal.

134
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,909
How informal?

135
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,918
What you're wearing will do.

136
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,519
- Forbes will see you to your rooms.
- I'm sure they're fine.

137
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,559
If it's all the same to you, I'd just
as soon have a talk with my client.

138
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,995
Think you could get us
a lift down to the jailhouse?

139
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,916
The chauffeur is at your disposal.

140
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,029
- Charlene!
- Clark!

141
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,000
Now, let me look at you.

142
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,913
Oh, Clark. You're embarrassing me.

143
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,992
You have nothing
to be embarrassed about.

144
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,798
This is my father, Ben Matlock.

145
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,359
Clark Harrison.

146
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,509
Nice to meet you.

147
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,399
Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Matlock.

148
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,074
- I've certainly heard a lot about you.
- And vice versa.

149
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,629
- Charlene?
- We're just on our way downtown.

150
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,028
- So...
- Oh, I'll be here.

151
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,599
Okay.

152
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,034
He's a real go-getter, isn't he?

153
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,676
Would you be more comfortable
if I brought a translator in here?

154
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,955
No.

155
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,873
I want you to understand
our line of defence.

156
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,600
We're going to show that
Richard Ward was a bad man,

157
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,557
an immoral man
who had many affairs.

158
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,193
Do you understand?

159
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,273
I understand.

160
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,113
I think he took advantage of you.
You were a servant in his home,

161
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,589
and he pushed you to the limit.

162
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,239
Maybe he was blackmailing you?

163
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,719
No.

164
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,154
I think you were afraid of him,

165
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,279
and when you finally fought back,
there was a fight, and you killed him.

166
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,238
Circumstances might even indicate
it was self-defence.

167
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,676
I killed him.

168
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,189
I killed Se¤or Ward.

169
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,995
I remember when you used to
come here when I was little.

170
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,037
I'm surprised you remember
that far back.

171
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,633
Well, I do.

172
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,075
I remember when you used
to read me stories.

173
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,800
And there was one about a little girl
who rode on a tiger.

174
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,678
Oh, that's right.

175
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,116
Mr. Matlock, are you gonna bring
Sonya back from jail?

176
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,633
I'm gonna try.

177
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,438
Come, Lila, it's bedtime.

178
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,397
Say your good nights.

179
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,555
- Good night, Mother.
- Good night, darling.

180
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,872
- Good night, sweetie.
- Good night.

181
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,713
- Good night, everyone.
- Good night.

182
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,155
- Good night.
- Good night.

183
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,517
Thanks, Forbes.

184
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,633
How is Sonya?

185
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,949
Not too cooperative.

186
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,111
Just exactly how do you plan
on defending her?

187
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,679
Well--

188
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,109
- What are they doing here?
- What are you doing here?

189
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,759
This is Richard's son, Daniel.

190
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,229
- Benjamin Matlock.
- Oh, I know who they are.

191
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,115
It's bad enough you hired them
to defend my father's killer,

192
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,271
but you have the gall
to put them up in his home.

193
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,238
First of all, this house belongs
to the Harrison family,

194
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,879
not to you or to your late father.

195
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,951
I know you didn't like it
when my father told you

196
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,032
to quit sponging off the family
and get a job, but why don't you?

197
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,919
Very bad manners. Somebody really
ought to correct them for you.

198
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,355
- Is that a threat?
- Gentlemen.

199
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,154
Just like the good old days.

200
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,828
That's Maria.

201
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,199
Sonya's daughter.

202
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,554
Do you know her?

203
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,439
She lives with her father in Cuba.

204
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,353
Sounds to me
like you know a lot about Sonya.

205
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,873
I don't believe she could ever
do something like this.

206
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,519
I'll never believe it.

207
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,477
You know what?

208
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,629
You look like somebody
who could use a swim.

209
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,552
Yeah.

210
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,597
Thattagirl. Thattagirl. Look at that.

211
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,909
All right.

212
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,911
You're a good swimmer,
you know that?

213
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,036
Sonya taught me how.

214
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,838
A good friend, huh?

215
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,911
She was my best friend.

216
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,640
I wish she hadn't come back
that night.

217
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,277
- Hadn't come back?
- The night my stepfather was killed.

218
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,793
She went out with that man.

219
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,154
What man? When?

220
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,477
A little while after dinner.

221
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,789
He met her at the back gate.

222
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,837
- Do you know his name?
- No.

223
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,389
Would you recognise him
if you saw him again?

224
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,711
Oh, sure.
He came for her lots of times.

225
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,350
Now, this is very important.

226
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,715
Do you remember
when Sonya came back?

227
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,069
It's all right. Just tell the truth.

228
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,832
The police were already here,
and she had the knife in her hand.

229
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,956
Why didn't you tell anyone
you went out the night of the murder?

230
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,189
Well?

231
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,998
Sonya, you've got to help us.

232
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,310
Who was the man
Lila saw you with?

233
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,391
What time did you get home?

234
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,830
You have a possible alibi.
Why won't you use it?

235
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,311
I've defended clients for nearly
25 years, but never one like this.

236
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,519
If they're guilty or innocent,
they always yell their heads off.

237
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,311
I think you're covering for somebody,

238
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,916
and I intend to find out who it is
and why you're doing it,

239
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,878
and I'll do it with or without your help.

240
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,390
- Money.
- Money?

241
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,870
There's a lot around, and somebody's
bought off that poor woman in there.

242
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,396
Ben, I know Christina and Clark.
They're not murderers.

243
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,358
I used to think I could tell who was
capable of murder and who wasn't,

244
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,873
but that was a long time ago.

245
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,157
Charlene, I want you
to check the jail registry.

246
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,788
Get the names of everybody
who's been in to see Sonya.

247
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,758
Maybe we'll get lucky
and get the name of that man.

248
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,356
- Anything else, sir?
- Not just now, thank you.

249
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,669
Very good, sir.

250
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,078
And who might you be?

251
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,956
Oh, I'm with Mr. Matlock.

252
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,235
- I'm sure you are.
- Tyler Hudson at your service.

253
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,709
I don't think that will be necessary.

254
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,431
Good afternoon.

255
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,393
Didn't they feed you on the plane?

256
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,551
Not like this, they didn't.

257
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,711
Don't get too comfortable.
We have a lot of work.

258
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,869
Mr. Matlock?

259
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:04,190
Oh, Mrs. Ward, let me introduce
our investigator, Tyler Hudson.

260
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,793
How do you do?

261
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,837
We'd like to borrow Lila
for the afternoon.

262
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,754
We have the names and addresses of
four men who visited Sonya in her jail.

263
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,956
Perhaps she could identify
the one man

264
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,712
who took her out
the night of the murder.

265
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,233
Tyler will take good care of her.

266
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,075
Oh, can I, please?

267
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,076
Very well, but please--

268
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,712
- Please be careful.
- She'll be fine.

269
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,598
Shall we dance?

270
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,598
Bye, Mother.

271
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,914
All you have accomplished
is to put this family

272
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:39,039
on the front page of every newspaper
across the country.

273
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,156
I'm sorry you disapprove, Harriet.

274
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:46,872
I disapprove, but everyone else I know
thinks that you have lost your mind.

275
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,391
- Mr. Matlock--
- One minute!

276
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,115
I rest my case.

277
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,119
What on earth are you doing?

278
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,113
Oh, I was just attempting
to reconstruct the crime.

279
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,236
Wouldn't Richard have used
the back stairs?

280
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,233
Probably, but what if Sonya
weren't in her room?

281
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,516
What if someone else knew
where your husband was going

282
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,636
and beat him there
by using these stairs?

283
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,473
I was just trying to figure out
how much time it might've taken him.

284
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,232
This someone else...

285
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,072
Who did you have in mind?

286
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,800
Oh, I don't have anyone in mind.

287
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,476
Do you, by any chance, suspect me?

288
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,835
I could make a case for that.

289
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,231
You knew he was seeing the maid,
and you knew where her room was.

290
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,799
But I was asleep.

291
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,712
That'd be hard to prove.

292
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,758
You found the body.
Of course, this is all hypothetical.

293
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,195
- That's the house.
- Where is he?

294
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,037
Well, you know, Lila,

295
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,351
the first thing you learn
in the detective trade is patience.

296
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,030
For example,
that's the first name on this list.

297
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,316
And we could be here for hours.

298
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,755
There he is! That's him!
I'm sure of it.

299
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,433
That's the man
who went out with Sonya.

300
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,837
Get her out of here.

301
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,398
Say, buddy,
could I have a word with you?

302
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,039
Hey, hey!

303
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,552
Rack them up.

304
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,230
Anyone see a guy
come running in here?

305
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,552
Who wants to know?

306
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,598
Not me.

307
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,873
I just want a decent cue stick
to shoot some pool with.

308
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,469
This looks better.

309
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,312
Clark.

310
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,031
- It's a little early for that, isn't it?
- Oh, is it ever too late?

311
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,714
It's nice, but not now, thanks.

312
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,512
I've always wondered what you look
like when you woke up in the morning.

313
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,991
A lot like I do when I go to bed.

314
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,912
Well, I wonder
what you look like then too.

315
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,318
So...

316
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,111
What are you doing
with yourself these days?

317
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,039
Well, it is my job to

318
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,634
distribute my share
of the family fortune

319
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,678
in fine restaurants and clubs
on two continents. And it isn't easy.

320
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,874
But I'm doing my best.

321
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,917
It's very tiring.

322
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,469
Up again all night?

323
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,349
No.

324
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,839
While you've been lying here,

325
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,912
I have been up since the crack
of dawn, planning our entire day.

326
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,911
- What day?
- This day.

327
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,709
It starts off with a nostalgic drive
along the sea coast,

328
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,236
followed by an intimate little luncheon
in a terribly overpriced restaurant.

329
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,075
Well, that's very nice,
but I've already made plans.

330
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,829
You didn't.

331
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,555
Well, there is the small matter
of a murder trial.

332
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,670
Charlene.

333
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,595
- Excuse me.
- It's all right. Clark was just leaving.

334
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,278
In fact, I've left.

335
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,518
No comment.

336
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,999
I didn't ask for one.

337
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,598
I meant from you.

338
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,393
Excuse me.

339
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,438
Hello.

340
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,839
We do have servants, Mr. Matlock.

341
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,195
Oh, they're gonna have to
fix their own breakfast.

342
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,237
This is for my daughter and me.

343
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,309
A joke.

344
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,879
Oh, mild.

345
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,876
- How'd you sleep?
- Great.

346
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,792
Good mattress.

347
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,995
- Been a long time.
- I've still got the knack.

348
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,195
Bacon?

349
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,312
Hash browns?

350
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,270
- You still have the knack, don't you?
- Oh, yes.

351
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,668
Where's Tyler?

352
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,308
Still staked out on Rodriguez.

353
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,508
- I'm waiting.
- For what?

354
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,272
For you to ask me about Clark.

355
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,713
Charlene, you're a grown woman.
I respect your privacy.

356
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,238
What the hell was he doing
in your bedroom?

357
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,717
Nothing. Really.

358
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,518
Just his way of being charming,
I guess.

359
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,433
You know,
he used to have so much promise.

360
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,558
He was bright and talented.

361
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,188
He just never did anything
with himself.

362
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,952
- How old is he?
- Thirty.

363
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,075
Damn near too old to learn
to do anything, isn't he?

364
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,238
Tyler nailed down Sonya's friend.

365
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,038
Oh, I forgot the salsa.

366
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,116
Spanish. Makes them hot.

367
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,636
Sergeant Maguire.

368
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:29,756
I call your attention to
People's Exhibit One

369
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,751
and ask if you recognise it.

370
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,273
Yes, I do.

371
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,715
Where was this weapon found?

372
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,869
Objection.

373
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,589
The exhibit is identified
as a kitchen knife, not a weapon.

374
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,909
Sustained.

375
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,629
And where was this knife found?

376
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:50,394
The defendant was holding this knife
when she surrendered to the police.

377
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,677
Were any laboratory tests
performed on this knife?

378
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,829
Yes, there were.

379
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,638
And what were the results
of those tests?

380
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,509
Blood stains and skin particles
found on this knife

381
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,875
were consistent
with those of the decedent.

382
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,474
And where was the decedent found?

383
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,110
In the servant's room,
which was occupied by the defendant.

384
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,911
Now, when the defendant
surrendered to the police,

385
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,192
was she advised of her rights?

386
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,715
Yes, she was.
In Spanish and in English.

387
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,598
And did she make a statement?

388
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,992
She said she killed Mr. Ward.

389
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,073
Thank you, sergeant.

390
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,468
No further questions.

391
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,232
Cross-examine.

392
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,476
Sergeant Maguire,

393
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,316
what was the victim wearing
when you found him?

394
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,994
Pyjamas, slippers, and a robe.

395
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,354
You wear pyjamas?

396
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,112
Objection, Your Honour. Irrelevant.

397
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,510
I'm trying to make a point here,
Your Honour.

398
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,469
Overruled.

399
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,154
Answer the question.

400
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,315
- I wear pyjamas.
- Me, too.

401
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,754
Do you wear slippers?

402
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,673
- Yes.
- How do you remove them?

403
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,515
One at a time.

404
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,751
Actually, what I meant was,

405
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,878
do you sit down
when you take them off?

406
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,155
Yes.

407
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,835
Now, isn't it true
that when you found Mr. Ward's body,

408
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,036
he had on only one slipper?

409
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,758
- Yes.
- Where was the other one?

410
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,955
By the side of the bed.

411
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,150
Isn't it reasonable to assume

412
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,278
from the position of the body
and the placement of the slipper

413
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,716
that Mr. Ward sat
on the edge of the bed,

414
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,599
took off one slipper before
he was stabbed with the knife?

415
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,034
Objection, Your Honour.

416
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,352
This line of questioning calls for
speculation on the part of the witness.

417
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,635
Your Honour,

418
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,754
I am not asking this witness
to speculate,

419
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:41,232
only to confirm that which is consistent
with the known facts in this case.

420
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,753
This is, that Mr. Ward

421
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,117
was familiar and comfortable enough
in this woman's bedroom

422
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,838
to take off his slippers.

423
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,671
Quiet, please.

424
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,231
Counsel will approach the bench.

425
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,593
Your Honour,
Mr. Matlock is attempting

426
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,035
to put the victim on trial here.

427
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,078
Your Honour,
it is essential for our defence

428
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:11,119
that the court recognise the
character and behaviour of Mr. Ward.

429
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,317
We intend to show that this
married man in a position of authority

430
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,596
was forcing his attentions
on this frightened,

431
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,991
virtually defenceless foreign national.

432
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,679
I am going to allow
this line of questioning.

433
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:30,039
I think a full understanding of the
circumstances is important for the jury.

434
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,079
I don't think it will militate against the
prosecution's presentation of fact.

435
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,516
Sergeant Maguire,

436
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,232
what was the defendant wearing
when you arrested her?

437
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,637
Some sort of print dress.

438
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,920
Sergeant Maguire,
are you suggesting

439
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,389
that the defendant got out of bed,

440
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:55,872
got dressed, took a walk
with the murder weapon in her hand?

441
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,439
No.

442
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,591
I'm not suggesting
anything of the kind.

443
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,193
I'm relieved to hear that.

444
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,396
No further questions.

445
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:10,839
Your Honour, the prosecution calls
Dr. Milton Osprey to the stand.

446
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,198
Mr. Ward?

447
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,715
Leaving so soon?

448
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,632
I'll come back for the sentencing.

449
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,155
You're never in one place
for very long, are you?

450
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,117
Not if I can help it, no. Why?

451
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,636
I've been trying to reach you, but your
secretary says you're out of town.

452
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,190
Well, that's just what I say
when I don't wanna take a call.

453
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,231
I just wanted to ask you where you
were at the time of the murder.

454
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,038
I was out of town.

455
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,475
I'm not surprised.

456
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,473
Well. Your subpoena.

457
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,079
Rack them.

458
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,749
And give this five-spot
to Mr. Rodriguez.

459
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,713
There's a guy over there
who wants to talk to you.

460
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,878
Who are you?

461
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,959
I'm Sonya's lawyer.

462
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,076
Your wife told me
I might find you here.

463
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,958
You better get out of here
while you can.

464
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,272
You're supposed to be
a friend to Sonya.

465
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,078
Get out.

466
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,875
Mr. Rodriguez,

467
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,951
if you'll tell your friends
to go back to the bar,

468
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,838
their next beer is on me.

469
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,150
I'll say my piece to you,
and then I'll leave.

470
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,510
If you were with Sonya
the night of the murder,

471
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,432
you can stop what's
happening to her.

472
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,115
I don't know what your problem is,

473
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,396
but I'm sure I can help you with it.

474
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,512
I could be a lot of trouble for you too.

475
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,233
You could wind up being charged
as an accessory to murder.

476
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,391
You could go to prison.

477
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,154
Talk to me now or the police later.
I'll leave it up to you.

478
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,633
- Stay close to him.
- I've got him.

479
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,116
People are asking questions.

480
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,429
No.

481
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,556
I wanna talk to you.

482
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,392
Then when?

483
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,070
Okay, <i>bueno.</i> I'll be there.

484
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,552
Tyler?

485
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,389
How is he?

486
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,949
Doctor says he's got
broken bones and a concussion.

487
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,111
- Nothing really serious.
- Can I see him tomorrow?

488
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,874
- He said maybe.
- He'll be okay.

489
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,198
Why don't you leave
my husband alone?

490
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,553
Mrs. Rodriguez, we're very sorry about
what happened to your husband,

491
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,677
but we can help him
if you'll tell us who did this.

492
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,318
Sonya.

493
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,196
Someone tried to kill him.

494
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,954
Next time, they might succeed.

495
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,032
I don't know what hold
this killer has over you,

496
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,351
but it must be powerful,
because in spite of all that's happened,

497
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,750
you're still willing to expose
your friend to danger.

498
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,840
No matter how strong it is,
it can be broken,

499
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,595
if you'd just let me help you.

500
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,913
Let me help you, please.

501
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,632
Thank you.

502
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,391
Sonya.

503
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,949
Why won't you let me help you?

504
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,548
So...

505
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,308
How would you describe
your father?

506
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,354
A self-made man
devoted to his family.

507
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,277
- Devoted?
- Yes.

508
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:19,435
You are aware he was having
a physical relationship with his maid.

509
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,594
I am now, yes.

510
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,671
But he was devoted to his family?

511
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:29,038
I don't know why my father was driven
to do what he did, or by whom,

512
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,991
but I do know he was always
devoted to my mother and me.

513
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,875
Your mother was
the late Helen Ward?

514
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,439
Yes.

515
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,238
She became an alcoholic.

516
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,149
Yes.

517
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,709
- Do you blame your father for that?
- No.

518
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,110
Could you specify for the court

519
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,078
when your mother developed
a serious drinking problem?

520
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,034
I don't recall.

521
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,671
Was it after your father left her?

522
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,438
I suppose so, yes.

523
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:05,076
Isn't it true that your mother
died in an automobile accident

524
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,357
while driving under the influence?

525
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,029
Yes.

526
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,556
Isn't it true that on several occasions
you publicly denounced your father

527
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,870
as being responsible
for your mother's condition?

528
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,632
Objection.

529
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,028
Relevancy.

530
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,674
Sustained.

531
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,671
No further questions.

532
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,071
Court will recess
and reconvene at 2 p.m.

533
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,433
How we doing here?

534
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,309
Well, we're making some progress
on Richard Ward's lack of character,

535
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,790
but if we break through to Rodriguez,
we may establish reasonable doubt.

536
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,679
They took him out of ICU and put him
in a room early this morning.

537
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,673
Let's see if we can talk to him.
Any luck finding the car that hit him?

538
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,637
No plates, but you wouldn't think
it'd be hard

539
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,916
to track down a red '55 Thunderbird.

540
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,355
- Red T-Bird?
- Yeah, the car is a classic.

541
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,476
There can't be that many of them
in this town.

542
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,471
Let's go to the hospital. You coming?

543
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,790
No, I'll meet you back here.

544
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,749
We sure had some good times
tooling around in that, didn't we?

545
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,439
- Where were you yesterday?
- Why?

546
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,559
Because someone used this car
yesterday to run down Sonya's alibi.

547
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,832
And whoever that was
made a deal with Sonya

548
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,797
to take the rap
for Richard Ward's murder.

549
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,276
- And you suspect me?
- I don't want to.

550
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,668
Well, then why would you?

551
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,068
Because you're a rich man's son

552
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:28,596
who's never given a moment's thought
to anything or anyone but himself.

553
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,918
I was at the symphony.

554
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,310
And I have witnesses,
about 1 500 of them.

555
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,278
- Satisfied?
- I suppose so.

556
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,510
You just eliminated yourself,
the orchestra,

557
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,592
and about 1 500 others as suspects.

558
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,551
Mr. Rodriguez, please listen to me.

559
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,679
The only thing that can save you
and your family is to tell me the truth.

560
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,839
You again?

561
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,752
Can't you leave this family alone?

562
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,832
Don't you understand?
You can't help us.

563
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,639
For God's sakes,
haven't you done enough harm?

564
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,839
I'm sorry for what's happened.
I truly am.

565
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,509
Tyler, what's the matter with me?

566
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,957
It's so simple.

567
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,237
Is the defence ready to proceed?

568
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,317
Could the court have a short delay,
Your Honour?

569
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,879
We're waiting for counsel.

570
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,600
Just how long are we
supposed to wait?

571
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,751
Put me on the stand.

572
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,473
You won't regret it.

573
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,396
Is counsel for the defence deliberately
trying the patience of this court?

574
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,472
Because if you are,
you are succeeding admirably.

575
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,793
I call Clark Harrison to the stand.

576
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,790
It was a quarter of 1 1
on the night of the murder.

577
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,038
I was going to meet someone
for a midnight sail.

578
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,270
I took the back stairs
because that's the fastest way

579
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,431
to get to the garage from my room,

580
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,716
and I noticed that
Sonya's door was open.

581
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,555
She wasn't in her room,
and her bed hadn't been slept in.

582
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,438
How do you know the exact time?

583
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,999
There's a clock
on the kitchen wall.

584
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,674
It's the first thing I saw
when I turned on the lights.

585
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,718
Why didn't you come forward with
this testimony sooner, Mr. Harrison?

586
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,830
Because I'm a rich man's son

587
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,117
who never gave a moment's thought
to anyone or anything but myself.

588
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,111
Why are you coming forward now?

589
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,840
Because I'd like to publicly apologise

590
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,356
to Mrs. Cardenes.

591
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,197
No further questions.

592
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,679
Cross-examine.

593
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,833
Mr. Harrison, sir,

594
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,393
did you check to see if the defendant
had gone to wash up?

595
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,869
No, I didn't.

596
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,470
Did you see
if she was in the living room?

597
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,434
No.

598
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,672
In other words, she could have been
in any room in the house.

599
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,193
Yes, I suppose so.

600
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,199
No further questions.

601
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,517
Mama.

602
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,513
Mr. Matlock.

603
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,558
Your Honour, we have just uncovered
some new evidence

604
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,757
that will have
a significant bearing on this case.

605
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,798
May I have a few moments
with my client?

606
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,516
All right.
Court will recess for ten minutes.

607
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,155
<i>Your daughter's a beautiful little girl.</i>

608
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:57,753
I'm a father, and I know
I would do anything for my child.

609
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,710
Mr. Rodriguez told me
what you've been through,

610
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,634
and I'll do everything
in my power to see

611
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,916
that you're never separated
from your daughter again.

612
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,510
I want you to trust me.

613
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,596
Go on, Mrs. Cardenes.

614
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,638
Se¤or Ward gave me money.

615
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,994
It was not a great deal of money.

616
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,958
But in almost two years,

617
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:43,510
it was enough for me
to buy my daughter's way to America.

618
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,550
It costs a great deal of money
to smuggle someone

619
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,358
all the way from my country.

620
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,635
Excuse me, Your Honour.

621
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,959
We're going to get into
some pretty sensitive areas.

622
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:56,192
I'd like to ask my associate
to remove Mrs. Cardenes' daughter

623
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,271
from the courtroom.

624
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,469
Request granted.

625
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,114
It'll be just a moment.

626
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,309
It costs a great deal of money
to smuggle someone into this country.

627
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,350
He knew what I had done.

628
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,912
He told me
that he would call the authorities

629
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,436
and my daughter would be sent back
and never allowed to return

630
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,158
if I said no to him.

631
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,912
If you said no to him?

632
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,719
Mrs. Cardenes,

633
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,515
why did Mr. Ward give you money?

634
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,872
For sleeping with him.

635
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,632
Did you kill Richard Ward?

636
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,915
No.

637
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,593
You've told the police you did.

638
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,716
I agreed to say that.

639
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,798
What happened
the night of the murder?

640
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,958
I was coming home
from seeing my daughter,

641
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,793
who was with my cousin Rodriguez.

642
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,150
He came out of the house.

643
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,033
He had a knife.

644
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,270
Let the record show

645
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,513
the defendant has indicated
one Daniel Ward.

646
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,390
Daniel told me he killed him
for what he did to his mother.

647
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:26,512
He told me that if I would say I did it,

648
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,438
he would not inform on my daughter.

649
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,830
And he would give me
money to keep her.

650
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,353
How much money?

651
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,875
Twenty-five thousand dollars.

652
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,438
Did he give it to you?

653
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,995
He said I would get it after the trial.

654
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,073
May I see the ring you're wearing?

655
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,952
Beautiful.

656
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,839
Probably an antique. Very valuable.

657
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,117
Have you ever met Mrs. Helen Ward?

658
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,199
No. She had died
before I came to America.

659
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,793
I see.

660
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,589
I'm not very good at reading small print
without my glasses.

661
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,433
Could you read the inscription
for us?

662
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,398
''To Helen.

663
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,232
From Dick.

664
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,719
1 951 .''

665
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,593
Where'd you get that ring?

666
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,997
Daniel Ward gave it to me.

667
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,837
Was it sort of a down payment?

668
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,388
Yes.

669
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,749
Has the jury reached a verdict?

670
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,831
We find the defendant not guilty.

671
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,872
Thank you.

672
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,633
Oh, Clark.

673
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,110
- I'm so proud of you.
- So am I.

674
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,150
- Thank you, Mr. Matlock.
- Yes, sir.

675
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,231
I suppose you were
a bargain after all.

676
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,231
- Well...
- Is this goodbye?

677
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,516
- Yes.
- Good.

678
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,793
Charlene.

679
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,676
Well, Charlene...

680
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,671
Alone again.

681
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,951
Glad we took the case?

682
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:53,712
You know, about the good old days...

683
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,599
These are the good old days.
