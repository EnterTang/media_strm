1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,630
I tell you something, Carter.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,031
If I didn't have white hair
before this case, it's getting there now.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,393
Every time we think we got something,
it slips right through our fingers.

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,233
<i>But I really don't think the boy did it.</i>

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,676
I'll tell you one thing, if I was keeping
a young, good-Iooking woman

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,796
<i>and she started stepping out on me,</i>

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,157
especially with a younger man,
I'd be madder than hell.

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,118
<i>I don't know if I'd be mad enough</i>
<i>to kill her, but somebody was.</i>

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,794
What do you think?

10
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,835
<i>This is the lobby, Hobson speaking.</i>

11
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,151
Get up to 1 1 02 right away.
There's a woman screaming for help.

12
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,118
Something terrible has happened.
Hurry.

13
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,110
That's it. Charlene.

14
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,918
- Charlene.
- What?

15
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,275
You've organised my desk again.

16
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,713
- Looking for these?
- Yeah, yeah.

17
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,111
I guess when you get a certain age,
that's it, huh?

18
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,268
Dad.

19
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,873
I've been going over our books.

20
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,951
- Good.
- We're doing very well.

21
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,952
- Do you want a raise?
- Nope.

22
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,350
- Vacation?
- Nope.

23
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,629
Remember telling me
about when you were a kid,

24
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,756
and that boy lost his overcoat?

25
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,912
- Yeah.
- And you gave him yours?

26
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,992
- Yeah.
- Why don't we do that again?

27
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,957
Charlene, it's summertime.

28
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,388
What I'm trying to say is that

29
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,233
I think we should take a case
for nothing every now and then.

30
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,558
- We do.
- When?

31
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,312
Every now and then.

32
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,828
Dad, you've heard about this boy,
Kevin Meredith,

33
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,956
who was arrested
for killing his girlfriend?

34
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,918
- Yeah.
- I just had a long talk with his mother.

35
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,837
Charlene, the public defender's office
will do a fine job.

36
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,070
I used to be one of them.
I can speak for them.

37
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,958
He'll get a great defence.

38
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,829
His mom said he was advised
against even trying to go to college.

39
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,470
They said he wouldn't make it.

40
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,793
Well, he's been holding down two jobs
and he's an honour student.

41
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,876
She said she hoped it wasn't true,

44
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,835
So tell us what happened.

45
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,358
We'd been making love.

46
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,072
I went into the bathroom
to take a shower.

47
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,478
When I came out, there was a knife.

48
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,951
I picked it up...

49
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,511
...and Joanne was dead.

50
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,558
Did you see anybody?
Hear anybody?

51
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,033
- Anybody hate her?
- She was wonderful.

52
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,397
- Everybody liked her.
- Somebody didn't like her.

53
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,120
And right now,
the police and the DA think that's you.

54
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,508
I loved her.

55
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,072
I'm sorry, Kevin,
but that's not a defence.

56
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,595
Then what the hell is?

57
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,835
Did Joanne have some money?
I mean, judging from her address--

58
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,718
Her family was rich. Why?

59
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,238
Did she help you out now and then?

60
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,799
I never took anything from her.

61
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,315
She was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

62
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,391
I loved her.

63
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,677
And if you think anything else,
you can just get out of here.

64
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,472
Well, that's some temper
you got there.

65
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,870
I hope it won't be the death of you.

66
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,910
Joanne believed in me.

67
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,674
She believed I was gonna make it.

68
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,796
Be somebody.

69
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,994
That's part of why
I loved her so much.

70
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,919
She believed in me
when nobody else did.

71
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,876
She believed in me.

72
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,113
Well, come on, son.
Your arraignment's in half an hour.

73
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,830
Well, good morning, Lloyd.
How's everything in your life?

74
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,072
Morning, Ben.
You are always up, aren't you?

75
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,595
Well, I'm in a trade I like,
and I got another winner.

76
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,194
- Are your clients ever guilty?
- Not if I can help it.

77
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,511
Superior Court 3 is now in session.

78
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,559
The Honourable Judge Carter Addison
presiding. All rise.

79
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,870
We'll start with
the private counsel cases.

80
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,397
<i>The State v. Meredith.</i>

81
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,438
Benjamin Matlock for the defence,
Your Honour.

82
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,556
Defendant has been advised
of his rights,

83
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,836
waives reading of the indictment,

84
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,958
pleads not guilty, requests a jury trial.
Time is waived.

85
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,552
How would September 28th,
9 a.m. be, counsellor?

86
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,119
Fine with me, Your Honour.

87
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,079
Agreed.

88
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,439
Oh, Mr. Matlock,

89
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,989
I'd like to see you in chambers
when I'm finished here.

90
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,029
Of course.

91
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,234
Thank you so much
for defending my son.

92
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,755
We'll give it our best shot.

93
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,798
I know.

94
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,918
Phil, I know,
but the cat is now out of the bag.

95
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,396
Wha--? All right, look,
so it's not a surprise.

96
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,835
I'll tell you what, I'll act surprised.

97
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,515
All evening, I promise.
All right, I'll see you then.

98
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,752
I'm sorry, Ben. Some of the boys
were gonna surprise me

99
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,035
with a party at the Windsor,

100
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,112
celebrating my tenth year
on the bench.

101
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,872
My clerk just let it slip.

102
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,909
Ten years? Has it been that long?

103
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,399
As of tomorrow.

104
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,393
- Boy, the years go by.
- Too fast.

105
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,196
I remember when
we both had brown hair.

106
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,828
Oh, yes, right, well...

107
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,638
The old law society picture
from school.

108
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,554
- I remember a lot of those guys.
- You never did join, did you?

109
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,359
No, I never was much of a joiner.

110
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,397
I remember you were a hard worker.

111
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,358
Didn't you--? Weren't you
holding down a couple of jobs?

112
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,274
Well, it was either hold down
a couple of jobs or not go to school.

113
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,638
I always admired you, Ben.

114
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,953
- Yeah? I never knew that.
- Sit down.

115
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,394
I wanted to talk to you--

116
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,993
- Off the record.
- Yeah.

117
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,038
You know Paul Devereau's boy,
Dale,

118
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,476
passed the bar last year, and naturally,
Paul's gonna take him into the firm.

119
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,395
Oh, I'm a strong believer in nepotism.
So is my daughter, Charlene.

120
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,515
Well, anyway, Dale doesn't have
a lot of courtroom experience,

121
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,310
and it occurred to me this Meredith
case might be good practise for him.

122
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,636
Well, he's very bright.
I mean, he'll do a good job.

123
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,111
You're asking me to step aside?

124
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,388
Well, just to help Paul's boy out.

125
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,316
Well, Carter...

126
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,799
...I feel I have an obligation here.

127
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,350
I know it would be good practise
for Paul's boy,

128
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,590
but I've already accepted the case.

129
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,753
I know Paul's boy would do a good job,
but l-- I just--

130
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,911
I feel like I should stay on.

131
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,799
Well, it was just a thought.

132
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,996
Sure, sure.

133
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,038
Hey, listen, happy tenth.

134
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,633
Thank you.

135
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,836
It's strange. It's very strange.

136
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,151
I mean, if it had happened
on the street it would be strange,

137
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,995
but in his chambers,
it's very strange.

138
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,310
You're talking to yourself again.

139
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,879
Get this.

140
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,270
Carter Addison
calls me into his office

141
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,635
and asks me to step aside
on the Meredith case

142
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,597
and give it to Paul Devereau's boy.

143
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,591
- Dale.
- Yeah.

144
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,512
- Dale?
- Isn't that strange?

145
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,910
Never heard of a judge
doing anything like that.

146
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,472
- Hello, people.
- Hey, Tyler.

147
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,392
Tyler, I've been looking for you
all morning.

148
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,313
Well, I've been busy
getting my fall wardrobe together.

149
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,038
You just got a new wardrobe.

150
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,078
A man in my position cannot afford
to be five minutes out of style.

151
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,193
What position is that?

152
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,679
I have been nominated Young Atlanta
Businessman of the Year.

153
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,990
- Who nominated you?
- Me.

154
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,149
- You?
- Yeah.

155
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,554
And it's within the rules.

156
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,872
And if I win, the local financial
community will open its doors

157
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,395
and its chequebooks to me.

158
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,473
- What's the case?
- Kevin Meredith, pro bono.

159
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,634
There's no fee?

160
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,472
Well, look at the publicity.

161
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,552
Young Atlanta Businessman
of the Year with a heart of gold.

162
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,551
Anyone ever tell you
that you are one--

163
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,914
Absolutely.

164
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,355
- Coming?
- Wouldn't miss it.

165
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,829
- Tyler.
- Lieutenant.

166
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,228
- Hello, Ben.
- Hello, Rupert.

167
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,834
- Charlene. We about done here, Ben.
- Oh, good.

168
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,833
You wanna visit
with the building manager?

169
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,473
Don't you trust our lab, Ben?

170
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,235
Well, they're good, they're just
not looking to help Kevin Meredith.

171
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,713
Hey, Tyler.

172
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,030
There's no fingerprints in the bedroom
to speak of.

173
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,668
- They're all smudged.
- Look at that.

174
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,671
A burned spot.

175
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,034
Look at that ashtray.

176
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,471
Isn't that a pipe-smoker's ashtray?

177
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,996
Yeah, you can see where the bowl
fits right in there and there.

178
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,673
Check that for prints, huh?

179
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,910
Look around and see
if you can find some tobacco.

180
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,753
There's a cognac bottle in the kitchen,
see if it's got any prints.

181
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,433
You got it.

182
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,433
Dad. Building manager
was reasonably cooperative.

183
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,239
Now, he said Joanne Leigh
lived here for six months.

184
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,712
Paid for the whole year in advance.
Thirty-two thousand dollars.

185
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,192
Now, I'm wondering how a student
could afford $32,000.

186
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,635
Kevin said her people have money.

187
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,711
Manager told me
her mother's been calling in here.

188
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,996
Wanted to get Joanne's car
so she could sell it.

189
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,837
- Sell it?
- She lives over in Hastings.

190
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,831
She works as a chambermaid
in a hotel.

191
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,956
He said she's the only family
Joanne had.

192
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,955
He also told me that
when Joanne first moved in here,

193
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,394
she got two sets of keys.

194
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,709
Then about two months ago,

195
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,110
about the same time
she started seeing Kevin,

196
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,157
she asked for another set of keys.

197
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,788
So if Kevin Meredith didn't kill her,

198
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,670
then somebody came in
while he was taking a shower and did.

199
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,233
It may be whoever
got that other set of keys.

200
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,991
You know,
I can't get over Carter Addison

201
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,277
asking me to step aside on this.

202
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,073
I mean, I can understand a lawyer
asking a judge to step aside

203
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,676
because of a prejudice,
but a judge asking a lawyer,

204
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,512
don't you think that's odd?

205
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,755
Yeah, it is.

206
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,229
Ben, I didn't find any fingerprints
on that cognac bottle.

207
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,710
I did find this.
A pipe cleaner and some tobacco.

208
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,354
Oh, no.

209
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,438
This city kills me.

210
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,830
Here's a street
where absolutely nothing's happening

211
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,230
and you can only park here
for an hour.

212
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,436
I told you to read the signs.

213
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,673
How many parking spaces
did Joanne Leigh have?

214
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,717
She was assigned two,
but there was construction

215
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,757
going on in the garage,
so she was down to one.

216
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,953
So whoever was visiting her
had to park on the street.

217
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,678
Kevin Meredith doesn't have a car.

218
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,748
Check all the parking tickets issued
around here

219
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,956
in last two or three months.

220
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,312
- Parking tickets?
- Yeah.

221
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,677
- All of them?
- Yeah.

222
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,229
If somebody was keeping Joanne Leigh
and didn't wanna be seen,

223
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,960
he might have been parking around
here, and like somebody I know,

224
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,109
gotten a lot of tickets.

225
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,953
Hey, Ben, you got any idea
how long that's gonna take?

226
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,829
For the Young Businessman
of the Year, probably a heartbeat.

227
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,150
Wanna drive over to Hastings
and visit the girl's mama?

228
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,673
Yeah.

229
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,677
- You drive.
- Why?

230
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,159
Because I'm the senior partner
and I just got a ticket and everything.

231
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,029
Keep your eyes on the road,
stay in the speed limit,

232
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,760
and no rock 'n' roll on the radio.

233
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,395
I'm taking you back to the office.

234
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,837
I don't think you understand my anger,
how I feel, or anything at all.

235
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,639
Well, I'm sure you've had
a terrible loss, Mrs. Leigh.

236
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,155
My loss happened a long time ago.

237
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,311
You mean when your daughter
left home?

238
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,040
I was glad she wanted
to go to school.

239
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,833
First she'd come home on vacations

240
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,558
and then she stopped
coming home at all.

241
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,631
She'd go home with her friends.

242
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,360
She never liked it here in Hastings.

243
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,432
Hated it, so she left.

244
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,478
Can I sell her car?

245
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,759
I'll see what I can do.
We'll need you to testify at the trial.

246
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,876
You're working for the boy
who killed her.

247
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,191
We think somebody else
may have done that, Mrs. Leigh.

248
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,670
It seems that there was someone else
in Joanne's life.

249
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,592
Oh, you mean the man
who was keeping her.

250
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,072
- Did she say who it was?
- No, no, and I never asked.

251
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,879
All I know is that
he was some sort of bigshot.

252
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,519
He paid for her school.

253
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,875
We'd like you to tell the court
about this.

254
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,358
- You mean go to Atlanta?
- That's right.

255
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:14,751
Well, maybe. Maybe I could do that.
I got expenses if I do.

256
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,519
Travel, a place to stay.

257
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,194
How much?

258
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,273
Five.

259
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,239
Five thousand.

260
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,673
It's not our policy to pay people
for telling the truth, Mrs. Leigh.

261
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,829
I'm sorry.

262
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,748
This is your subpoena.
Requires your presence in court.

263
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,352
- Hi, Ben.
- Oh, hi.

264
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,356
- What do you make of her?
- She's tough.

265
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,670
I think she was really hurt
when her daughter left her.

266
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,992
Yes, Sarah. Okay.

267
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,357
- For you on one.
- I'll take it in the office.

268
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,672
Ben, I went through
all the parking tickets

269
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,910
for Joanne Leigh's neighbourhood.

270
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,392
I got a couple singles, a few doubles,
but nobody had a lot of parking tickets.

271
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,549
Nobody, huh?

272
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,553
And you were wrong about it
taking me a heartbeat.

273
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,950
It took me a lot of heartbeats.

274
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,350
Well, whoever was keeping her
had to park on the street,

275
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,034
and he had to have gotten
some parking tickets.

276
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,395
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

277
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,152
You know...

278
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,391
...if a person's got the juice...

279
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:44,793
...he could fix a ticket
and make it disappear

280
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,954
as though it never existed.

281
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,869
Did you know that?

282
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:57,590
Yeah, I knew that.
I don't know the details about how to--

283
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,518
Come on, fellas,
we haven't got much time.

284
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,592
Evening, Carter.

285
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,512
Well, hello, Ben.
What are you doing here?

286
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,399
Oh, sometimes I get the wanderlust.
Buy you a drink.

287
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,040
- Well, it's a little late.
- Oh, just one.

288
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,633
They got something here
very special.

289
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,030
Two Langlois Napoleon cognacs.

290
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,433
- Well, let me say good night.
- Yeah, okay.

291
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,157
Well, here's to dandelion season
or whatever season it is.

292
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,279
Yeah, I used to come here a lot.
They used to have jazz in here.

293
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,475
Yeah.

294
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,393
Remember those great dance bands
used to come through

295
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,835
and play dances at school?

296
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,630
Remember the name of that one
small band with the funny name?

297
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,789
''Snooky'' something?

298
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,315
Snooky Sandwich
and the Slippery Seven.

299
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,232
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

300
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,550
- You used to be a good dancer.
- I did okay.

301
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,154
- You still step out once in a while?
- Once in a while.

302
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,833
Good, huh?

303
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:16,394
Interestingly enough, I found a bottle
of this in Joanne Leigh's apartment.

304
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,709
- Who?
- Joanne Leigh, that murdered girl.

305
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,359
Oh, yes, yes.

306
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,318
I really am glad
I didn't step aside on this case.

307
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,675
It's fascinating. It really is.

308
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,549
There's a lot I don't know,
but I got a lot of things I think.

309
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,274
I think she was being kept
by an older man.

310
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,749
I think he smoked a pipe
and drank this same cognac.

311
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,356
I don't know that he killed her,
but he could have.

312
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,752
Felt threatened over her relationship
with this Kevin Meredith.

313
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,520
We're checking parking tickets
around her building,

314
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,399
around 23rd and Highview.

315
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,835
In fact, I got one there myself.

316
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,878
- You did?
- I don't suppose you could fix it?

317
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,794
- Well, I think not, Ben.
- I'm just joshing you.

318
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,634
Well, I better get home.
My wife's by herself.

319
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,916
- Big day tomorrow.
- For me too, Carter, for me too.

320
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,196
- Thanks, Ben. Good night.
- Yeah.

321
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,590
- Anything?
- Nothing good.

322
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,955
- No blood?
- No blood.

323
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,999
Damn. I thought we were
gonna get him tonight.

324
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,990
Well, it's not strange
that Carter Addison

325
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,832
asked you to step aside anymore,
is it?

326
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,391
No. Tell you one thing, he thinks
he's covered his tracks pretty good.

327
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,711
He's as cool as the centre seed
of a cucumber.

328
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,313
Ben, the judge's tobacco
from the restaurant

329
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,914
matches the blend I found
in Joanne's apartment.

330
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,354
Good.

331
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,430
- No blood in the car, huh?
- No blood.

332
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,873
Well, maybe he cleaned up
before he left.

333
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,439
Cleaned up? Where?

334
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,793
I don't know.

335
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,794
But he would have had to have done it
before he even got in his car.

336
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,597
You know...

337
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,349
...there's an apartment building

338
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,193
that's just across the street
from Joanne's,

339
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:16,399
and maybe when he first suspicioned
that she was stepping out on him--

340
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,790
Or that is, having somebody in.

341
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,474
--he might have gotten
the use of a place there.

342
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,234
Well, that would explain
why the parking tickets stopped.

343
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,834
The police said her shutters
were open.

344
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,188
Oh, Dad. You mean he got a place
in that building

345
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,035
so he could watch Kevin and Joanne
make love, maybe for weeks?

346
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,077
Well, let's just say

347
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,710
that maybe he was checking to see
if what he thought was happening

348
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,154
was happening.

349
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,188
- We better find it.
- Find what?

350
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,157
The apartment he was using,
if there was one.

351
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,438
Ben, there's probably
50 or 60 apartments

352
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,431
with a view of Joanne's windows.

353
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,830
Now, you can bet Addison
didn't use his real name.

354
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,389
Maybe he didn't even
rent the place himself.

355
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,959
Were you at your security desk
when the phone call came in?

356
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,838
Yes, sir, I was.

357
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,116
To the best of your recollection,

358
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,511
could you tell the court
what the man said?

359
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,799
I believe he said,

360
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,190
''Get up 1 1 02 right away.

361
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,318
A woman's screaming for help.
Something terrible is happening.''

362
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,469
What did you do?

363
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,835
Well, I got up there right away
and rang the bell.

364
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,309
When no one answered,
I let myself in.

365
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,472
- Was anyone there?
- Joanne's young friend.

366
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,951
I call your attention
to People's Exhibit 3.

367
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,153
Do you recognise it?

368
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,276
Yes, he was holding it
when I came in.

369
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,868
- Was anyone else in the apartment?
- No, sir, just him.

370
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,390
And is that man
presently in the courtroom?

371
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,391
Yes, sir, he is.

372
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,828
Would you identify him?

373
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,839
He's right over there.

374
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,716
Let the record show that the witness
identified the defendant.

375
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,231
No further questions.

376
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,398
Any cross-examination?

377
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,030
Mr. Hobson.

378
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,509
How long have you worked
at your apartment building?

379
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,554
Ten years, since the day
they opened the doors.

380
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,039
You know all the tenants?

381
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,395
Every last one of them,
down to the kids and the dogs.

382
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,675
And the dogs.

383
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,037
- I bet they know you.
- Yes, sir, they do.

384
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,792
You know,
something seems strange to me.

385
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:48,074
You testified that a man phoned you
and said, ''Get up to 1 1 02 right away.''

386
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,071
But he didn't call you by your name.

387
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,791
He didn't say,
''Harry, get up to 1 1 02,'' did he?

388
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,075
No, he didn't.

389
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,515
- Harry is your first name, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

390
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,797
- Did you recognise the man's voice?
- No, I didn't.

391
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:07,159
Mr. Hobson, are there house phones
in your building?

392
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,753
Yes, sir, there are.

393
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,673
- There one on every floor?
- That's right.

394
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,189
So someone could have called

395
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,079
from a house phone
rather than one of the apartments.

396
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,117
- Isn't that correct?
- Objection.

397
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,792
Relevancy.

398
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:31,398
Your Honour, I'm attempting to show
that to call the security guard,

399
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,279
a person does not necessarily
have to be a tenant.

400
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,318
Anyone could have come in
off the street and done it.

401
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,357
Sustained.

402
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,872
But, Your Honour,

403
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:48,239
if someone other than Kevin Meredith
killed Joanne Leigh,

404
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,756
then that person could have used
the house phone in the hall.

405
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,751
Mr. Matlock,
don't make me repeat myself.

406
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,070
The objection is sustained.

407
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,714
Your Honour,
may I approach the bench?

408
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,759
Counsel.

409
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,428
Your Honour,

410
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,433
defence is attempting to show
that someone else

411
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,433
had access to the dead woman's
apartment, and that phone.

412
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,354
Counsellor for the defence is indulging
in totally unjustified speculation.

413
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,635
This is a capital crime,

414
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,270
and I ask for the widest possible
latitude for my client.

415
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,429
Mr. Matlock, you've made your point.
Now, I will say, for the last time,

416
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,273
you will confine your examination
to the issues at hand.

417
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,829
Now, may we get on with this,
please?

418
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,068
Something else, Counsellor?

419
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,354
No.

420
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,677
Not yet.

421
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,556
- Is defence ready to proceed?
- Yes, Your Honour.

422
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,790
I call Claire Leigh to the stand.

423
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,679
Is Claire Leigh present?

424
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:05,711
Your Honour, this witness
may not have answered our subpoena.

425
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,997
May we take a brief recess
while we try to learn of her intentions?

426
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,239
Court is recessed for 30 minutes.

427
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,434
We haven't met.
I'm Joanne Leigh's mother.

428
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,473
They're waiting for you in court,
Mrs. Leigh.

429
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,190
Well, I thought we should talk first.

430
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,909
- Why is that?
- Joanne told me all about you.

431
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,199
That's not possible.
I didn't know your daughter.

432
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,114
Look, you know I don't have time
to play games here.

433
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:47,192
In a few minutes,
I'm gonna be on that stand,

434
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,033
and I know plenty
about you and Joanne.

435
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,715
But I'll keep my mouth shut
if you make it worth my while.

436
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,591
If you think I'm bluffing,
you're gonna be real sorry.

437
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,436
Real sorry.

438
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,513
Okay.

439
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,277
Wait, wait.

440
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,997
Mrs. Leigh.

441
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,919
You were Joanne's mother.

442
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,595
Yes.

443
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,478
And you're a woman
of modest means.

444
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,790
I worked hard all my life.

445
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,238
But your daughter lived very well
here in Atlanta.

446
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,312
She had a wonderful apartment
and lots of pretty clothes.

447
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:39,310
I was real proud of how well
my Joanne had done for herself.

448
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:44,479
Would you explain to the court
how a student with no family support

449
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,835
could afford all this luxury?

450
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,672
Well, she worked for it, of course.

451
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,319
- How did she support herself?
- As a model.

452
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,754
She was very beautiful.

453
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,718
I have scrapbooks
full of her pictures at home.

454
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:04,396
But modelling wasn't
the only way she got money, was it?

455
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,713
Yes.

456
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,875
Far as I know.

457
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,235
Are you telling this court

458
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,951
that your daughter paid for this luxury
apartment herself by modelling?

459
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,237
- Yes.
- Mrs. Leigh, you're under oath.

460
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,075
Objection. Counsel is harassing
his own witness.

461
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,798
Sustained.

462
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:30,112
Your Honour, I'm allowed to examine
my own witness any way I choose,

463
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,430
especially if I'm surprised
by her testimony,

464
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,434
and right now I can guarantee you
I'm flabbergasted by it.

465
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,036
Mr. Matlock, may I remind you
that in this courtroom

466
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,397
you may not harass a witness
under any circumstances.

467
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:46,712
Now, you may proceed.
I urge you to use caution and restraint.

468
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,151
Thank you for your advice,
Your Honour.

469
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,918
Mrs. Leigh.

470
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:02,389
Do you recall having a conversation
with my daughter a few days ago?

471
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,353
Yes, I do.

472
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,873
Do you recall stating then

473
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,634
that your daughter was being kept
by a powerful man?

474
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,789
No.

475
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,554
Isn't it true you said this man
made it possible for your daughter

476
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,948
to live very well?

477
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,519
You're trying to trick me.

478
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,319
And didn't you say this same man
made it possible for your daughter

479
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,678
- to come to school in Atlanta?
- Why are you telling these lies?

480
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,990
My baby would never take money
from a man like that.

481
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,591
She was a sweet, wonderful girl.

482
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,797
And now she's dead,
and I know who killed her. He did.

483
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,039
She told me.

484
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,996
She was scared to death
of his temper.

485
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,469
She said she was trying
to break it off,

486
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:48,030
and he threatened her,
and now she's dead.

487
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,232
He is the one who killed her.

488
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,916
No further questions.

489
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,956
Court is adjourned
until tomorrow morning, 9 a.m.

490
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,872
All rise.

491
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,959
Is counsel ready?

492
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,829
Your Honour,
may I approach the bench?

493
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,355
- What is it, Mr. Matlock?
- I'll get right to it, Your Honour.

494
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,149
Defence intends to call His Honour
as its next witness.

495
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,989
I have no information
relevant to this case.

496
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,312
Mr. Matlock, do you realise
the implication of your intention?

497
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,232
I'm afraid I do, Your Honour,

498
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,356
but I have an obligation
to present evidence

499
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,637
that I believe will be helpful
to my client's defence.

500
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,349
I think this is a complete waste of the
court's time and the state's money.

501
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,478
Your Honour's testifying
could mean a mistrial.

502
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,870
Then we'd have to start
this whole trial all over again.

503
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,553
That doesn't make any sense.

504
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,110
I have a sincere belief
that Your Honour

505
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,592
may have knowledge of facts
that may shed some light on this case.

506
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,430
My duty is to Mr. Meredith,
not to the state treasury.

507
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:46,312
I'll see both counsel
and the court reporter in chambers.

508
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,155
And I don't believe that I have
any information to help your client,

509
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,834
but I understand your position,

510
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,912
and we all appreciate
what a mistrial will cost us

511
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,752
in terms of time and money.

512
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,912
Now, Judge Cooksey is available.

513
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,991
If you and Mr. Burgess
will agree to Judge Cooksey

514
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,593
presiding over my examination,

515
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,672
I think we can put this matter to rest,
Mr. Matlock.

516
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,991
If you can show
that I know something important here,

517
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,311
then I'll agree to step down
and a mistrial will be declared.

518
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,392
If you can't, then I will retake
the bench tomorrow morning,

519
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,677
we'll finish this case
and send it to the jury.

520
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,955
Mr. Burgess?

521
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:30,272
It's unusual, but the state agrees
if Mr. Matlock does.

522
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,398
Defence goes along
with your proposal.

523
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,791
All rise.

524
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:57,794
Your Honour,
defence has just been presented

525
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,190
with new evidence
that's important to our case.

526
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:04,319
May we take a brief recess
to prepare for our next witness?

527
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,871
All right. This court will recess
until 2:30 this afternoon.

528
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,915
The truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth, so help me God.

529
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,957
Please be seated.

530
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,871
Mr. Addison.

531
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,669
Do you know Mrs. Claire Leigh?

532
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,510
Are you referring
to defence's witness?

533
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,752
- Yes, I am.
- I don't know her personally, no.

534
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,273
You are aware that she is the mother
of the deceased, Joanne Leigh?

535
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,317
I believe that was her testimony.

536
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:03,634
Have you had any occasion
to discuss this case with Mrs. Leigh?

537
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,631
Absolutely not.

538
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,357
Isn't it true that you met with her
this morning

539
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,751
- after she testified in your court?
- No, I did not.

540
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,990
And at that time,
didn't you give her an envelope

541
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,310
containing $1 5,000?

542
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,515
Objection.

543
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,114
The witness already testified
he never met with the woman.

544
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,316
Sustained.

545
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,072
Did you know Joanne Leigh?

546
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,719
- No.
- Never met her?

547
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,393
No.

548
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,438
Mr. Addison,
let me ask your opinion here.

549
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,875
If there were a condominium,

550
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:46,319
and its ownership were in question--
That is, it were in a lawsuit.

551
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,357
--could that condominium
be impounded by the court?

552
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,479
Yes.

553
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,838
So that neither party involved in that
lawsuit could enter that condominium?

554
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,989
Yes.

555
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,790
Now, if this condominium
were impounded by the court,

556
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:07,394
would it be difficult
for someone in the court,

557
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,516
say, a judge like yourself,

558
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,719
to obtain a key
to that impounded condominium?

559
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,429
This is getting a little hypothetical
for me, Mr. Matlock.

560
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,750
Is counsel about to come to a point?

561
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,592
Well, Your Honour,

562
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,151
I'm just trying to establish
that it would not be difficult.

563
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:30,552
In fact, it would be quite simple
for a judge to obtain a key

564
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,119
to an impounded condominium.

565
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,713
Now,

566
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:39,837
are you familiar with a condominium
building at 437 Highview Street?

567
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,036
No, I am not.

568
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,394
Let me refresh
Your Honour's memory.

569
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,399
This condominium building

570
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:55,158
is directly across from the apartment
building where Joanne Leigh lived.

571
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,073
Mr. Matlock, I have already stated
I am not familiar with this building.

572
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,879
Now, I agreed to testify
based on your assurances

573
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,792
that I would be a material witness.

574
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,110
So far,
you have demonstrated nothing.

575
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,234
Maybe this might clarify it.

576
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:16,110
From this condominium building,
with a pair of binoculars,

577
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:22,628
a person can look right into
Joanne Leigh's apartment,

578
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,631
which is what the killer did

579
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,910
while he watched and waited
for his chance to murder her.

580
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,949
Would Mr. William Bryan
please rise.

581
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,709
Now, this condominium building
is occupied

582
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:43,634
primarily by retired people.

583
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,315
Mr. Bryan is a former member
of the Atlanta police department.

584
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,550
- Do you recognise him?
- No, I do not.

585
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,472
You didn't see Mr. Bryan there
this morning

586
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,039
when you were in that building?

587
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,760
I have--
I've never been in that building.

588
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:00,753
I suppose we could have
Mr. Bryan testify

589
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,558
that he saw you in that building,

590
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:07,236
but then, that wouldn't prove
that you killed Joanne Leigh, would it?

591
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,716
Order. Order in the court.

592
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,153
Matlock, I warn you,
making these unsubstantiated charges

593
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,639
is contemptible.

594
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,236
Mr. Addison, I don't make
unsubstantiated charges.

595
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,154
You see, this morning...

596
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,030
...when you went back
to that condominium...

597
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:35,030
...when Mr. Bryan saw you,
to remove your clothes

598
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,991
that you had left there
till this whole thing was over...

599
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:44,118
...you didn't remove your clothes.

600
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,709
They were replacements

601
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:52,396
that were placed there
by my associate, Mr. Tyler Hudson.

602
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,028
These are your clothes.

603
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,429
This is your raincoat.

604
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,035
See Joanne Leigh's blood?

605
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,110
These are your gloves.

606
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,392
Your hat.

607
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,077
Your shoes.

608
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,950
Which I place into evidence now.

609
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,838
Carter.

610
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,475
You were one of the best
and one of the brightest.

611
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,757
I'm truly sorry it's come to this.

612
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,030
No further questions.

613
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:49,833
Your Honour, rather than a mistrial,
prosecution moves for dismissal.

614
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,991
Case dismissed.

615
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,112
- Good to hear.
- All right.

616
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,271
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

617
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,351
- Ben, congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

618
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,112
Good job.

619
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,476
We can't thank you enough.

620
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,791
If you wanna thank someone,
thank her.

621
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,829
Your daughter would be very proud.
