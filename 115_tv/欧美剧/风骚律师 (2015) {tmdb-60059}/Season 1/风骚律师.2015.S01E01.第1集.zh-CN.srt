00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,000
穿上战袍 带上头盔 整装待发 Putting one of these on and one of these on your head so helps.

139
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,040
就像超人变身 It's like Superman coming out of the phone box.

140
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,680
来吧 Gary Rush一案 受害人85岁 这一点让事情... OK Gary Rush. The victim is 85 years old which makes this...

141
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:04,400
非常糟糕 就是说会影响到对真凶的落网 well a bad bad thing which is why it matters that the right man goes down for it.

142
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,080
一个关键问题 一个85岁的老人在恐慌下 One big question - can a terrified 85-year-old be relied upon

143
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,360
可以正确指认出带着巴拉克拉法帽的袭击者吗? to identify his balaclaved attacker correctly?

144
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,920
-是你来找Gary? -是的 -You here for Gary? -Yes.

145
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,600
Scarrow警司 DS Scarrow.

146
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,720
-这边走 -谢谢 -赠你一言 不要跟他单独相处 -There you go. -Thank you. -Word of advice. Don't be alone with him.

147
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,200
-你别吓唬我了 -我是担心你的安全 仅此而已 -You don't intimidate me. -I'm concerned for your safety that's all.

148
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,960
-我们没时间跟他详谈 来个缓兵之计吧 -啥? -Right we haven't got time to talk to him properly so think like a waitress. -What?

149
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:36,520
先上餐前小点 然后他们就会乖乖地等上菜 Get the bread on the table the drinks out fast then they're happy to wait for the food.

150
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,520
-你是我代表律师? -对 -Are you for me? -Yes.

151
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:46,720
-这小子是谁? -这是..是我的学徒 -Who's the boy? -This is...is my pupil.

你能行吗? Are you good?

153
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,040
给我几分钟 我们好好谈一下 Look give me a few minutes and then we'll talk properly.

154
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:56,520
如果我被判罪了 就要坐蹲牢 而且蹲很久 I'll be going to prison huh for a very long time if I'm convicted of this.

155
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,520
坦白说 我之前从未见过你 Now I've never met you before 

156
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,120
而从我这里看出去你有点弱不禁风 but from where I'm standing you look a bit lightweight frankly.

157
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,880
所以你最好马上回答我的问题 So I think you should answer my question. Now.

158
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,720
我能行 I'm good.

159
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,800
-但你不是皇家律师 -还不是 -But you're not a QC. -Not yet.

160
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,240
你不进来跟我谈吗? Are you not going to come in talk to me?

161
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,000
我时间宝贵 Rush先生 I'm short of time Mr Rush.

162
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,520
-这个难缠吗? -不 -Is this one difficult? -No.

163
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,840
是Mercedes Cordoba吗? Mercedes Cordoba?

164
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,880
我是Martha Costello 你的律师 I'm Martha Costello your Brief.

165
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:53,560
-你吞了12个装满了可卡因的避孕套 -是 -You swallowed 12 condoms filled with cocaine? -Yes.

166
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,320
预产期是什么时候? When's the baby due?

167
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,840
八周以后 Eight weeks.

168
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,860
你知不知道 Do you know 

169
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,760
那些避孕套在你体内破开了会有什么后果? what would have happened if the condoms had broken open inside of you?

170
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,040
会死 You die.

171
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,560
-还有你的孩子 -我知道 -And your baby. -I know.

172
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,560
你之前生过孩子? You've got children already?

173
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,000
-是 -多少个? -Yes. -How many?

174
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,680
五个 Five.

175
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,160
你几岁? How old are you?

176
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,640

00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,520

178
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,440
关于你的同案被告 你有什么要说的吗? Is there anything you want to say about your co-defendant?

179
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,800
-那么指使你运毒的人呢? -没有 -What about the people who asked you to carry the drugs? -No.

180
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,960
如果你现在认罪 你会得到最大的宽恕 If you plead guilty now you'll get maximum credit

181
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,400
就是说你可以减刑三分一或者四分一 which means about a third or a quarter off your sentence.

182
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:50,200
无论判刑多少年 对你和你的孩子来说都太长了 You know that whatever sentence you do get will be too long for the baby to stay with you in prison.

183
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,160
你现在不是非要认罪不可 You don't have to plead guilty now

184
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,680
但这个法官挺好的 but this judge is all right

185
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,920
下次审判未必能碰上同一个法官 and you might not get the same judge next time.

186
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,120
我明白 I understand.

187
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,120
好了 好了 OK. OK.

188
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,920
我需要你在我的诉讼状上签字 I need you to sign the front of my brief.

189
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:20,760
这只是说明我没有给你施加任何压力 你明白吗? This just makes clear that I've not put any pressure on you. Do you understand?

190
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,520
好 OK.

191
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,160
就在那 Just there.

192
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,080

193
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,640
-你多大了? -35岁 -How old are you? -35.

你35岁多久了? How long have you been 35?

195
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,280
几年吧 Couple of years.

196
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,600
是不是很难做到皇家律师? Is it hard to get Silk?

197
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,360
境界都不同了 可以挑案子来做 Everything changes. You get to choose your cases 

198
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,800
想休假 就休假 take time off when you want to 

199
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,600
提出诱导性提问不被追究 ask leading questions and get away with it.

200
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,600
我是Cant Frogett事务所的 来办Rush的案 I'm from Cant Frogett for the Rush trial. 

201
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,600

202
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,040
我去试镜了 我不工作的时候我就去当演员 I had a casting. I'm an actor. This is what I do when I'm not working.

203

-哪里的试镜? -海飞丝 -What was the casting for? -Head and Shoulders.

204
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,040
洗发水巨头? The shampoo giant?

205
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,720
认罪? Pleading?

206
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,240
是的 Yes.

207
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,160
那是谁? Who's that?

208

公会来了两个实习律师 Two new pupils in Chambers.

00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,560

-我是Nick Slade -喔 你是另外一个 -Nick Slade. -Oh right you're the other one.

212
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,640
另外一个? The other one?

213
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,640
抱歉 我说得不太清楚 Sorry that came out a bit wrong.

214
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,840
我是另外一个实习律师 Niamh I'm the other new pupil. Niamh.

215
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,920
我们是不是该...握个手什么的? Shouldn't we...shake hands or something?

216
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,160
大律师不握手的 约定俗成 Barristers don't shake hands. It's kind of a rule.

217
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,960
明白 Right.

218
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,400

00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,160
全体起立 All rise.

221
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,720
Billy说这个法官可能成为我丝袍申请的推荐人 Billy said this judge might be a reference for my Silk application.

222
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,720
-他也那样跟我说过 -不可能我们都找他吧 -He said that to me too. -We can't both ask him. 

223
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,240
我们拭目以待 Let's see how we go shall we?

224
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,560
Mercedes Cordoba很穷 Mercedes Cordoba is poor.

225
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:24,320
她来自波哥大的波利瓦城 就是说她极度贫穷 She comes from the Ciudad Bolivar in Bogota which means her poverty is extreme.

226
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,240
她的弱势让贩毒集团很容易入手 She was classically vulnerable to the approach from the drug cartel

227
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,760
以金钱诱使她毒藏腹内 who exploited her with the offer of money

228
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,800
然后搭上飞往伦敦的班机  for traveling on a hot flight to London with drugs in her belly.

229
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,600
她已提起极大的勇气承认罪行 She has shown great courage in pleading guilty.

230
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,880
她明白那将令她的孩子无所依靠 She knows that she will lose her baby into care.

231
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,920
我们可以想像一个人要有多绝望 We can only imagine how hopeless your situation must be

232
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,080
才会去吞下那些装满可卡因的避孕套 to agree to swallowing condoms filled with cocaine

233
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,240
明知可能危及自身和胎儿的性命 knowing the damage they could cause to you and your baby.

234
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,920
Mercedes Cordoba不是无情 不是邪恶 Mercedes Cordoba is not heartless not evil

235
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,440
她不过是绝望了 she's just desperate.

236
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,480
她要为她的行为付出代价 她知道的 She will pay for what she's done she knows that

237
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,800
但我恳请法官阁下在判罚时 but I ask your Honour to pass a sentence

238
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,560
考虑到她的不幸 给她一个重生的机会 which reflects her sad life and gives her hope for a better one.

239
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,660
你要向我 Do you want to address me 

240
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,360
就案中两位被告相对的地位提出见解吗? on the relative status positions of the two defendants?

241
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,000
法官阁下 我认为我要说的都已经说过了 I think it's already there in everything I've said your Honour.

242
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,520
Reader先生 Mr Reader.

243
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,120
我很惊讶我渊博的同行选择了避而不谈 I'm surprised that my learned friend has chosen not to talk about

244
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,380
相对于我的当事人 where her client is in the hierarchy

245
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,360
她的当事人是犯罪集团内的要员  compared with mine.

246
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,680
法官阁下已经看过补充证据通告了吗? Your Honour has seen the Notices of additional evidence?

247
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,440
Mercedes Cordoba是个经验老到的贩毒者 Mercedes Cordoba is an experienced trafficker.

248
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,000
她利用多次的怀孕摆脱海关稽查 She uses her repeated pregnancies to throw off customs.

249
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,280
她没想到 她已经被海关留意多年 What she didn't know was that she was being watched by Customs over a period of years.

250
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,320
每次旅程都在她怀孕期间 She's pregnant every time she travels.

251
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,640
是她防止被截查的手段 It's her protection against being stopped.

252
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,640
修女 女童军和孕妇皆可无障碍通关 Nuns girl guides and pregnant women get waved through.

253
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,400
我的当事人Angel Valera 是司机 Angel Valera my client is the driver.

254
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,160
他在飞机场跟她碰面 He met her at the airport.

255
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,640
没有证据显示他曾经之前参与过类似的事件 There is no evidence that he has ever done anything like this before.

256
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,480
换言之 他不过在贩毒集团最底层 He is at the bottom of the ladder in terms of his position in the hierarchy.

257
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:09,520
他是这位狡猾的孕妇 即同案被告 手下的一个小人物 A good many rungs below that of his cunning pregnant co-defendant.

258
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,080
Costello小姐 机会是可一不可再 No second bite at the cherry Miss Costello.

259
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,400
你们两位 起立 Stand up both of you.

260
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,510
你们的非法集团给我国带来痛苦和不幸 I have to establish in my own mind 

261
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,720
我必须理清思路 where each of you stands

262
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,720
明确你们各自在这个集团里所处的地位 in the ranks of this evil organisation that brings misery into our country.

263
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,000
ercedes Cordoba 我确信你是集团的上层人物 I have no doubt that you Mercedes Cordoba are a good way up it 

264
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,920
你的辩护律师怎样力辩也是徒劳 whatever your Counsel says.

265
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,680
你将入狱14年 You will go to prison for 14 years.

266
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,480
Angel Valera 你侥幸地 Angel Valera you have the dubious good fortune

267
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,120
只是身处这个不法集团里的底层 to be a long way down the pecking order in this obscene organization

268
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,240
对你判刑时我会考虑及此 and I have to reflect that in your sentence.

269
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,000
你将入狱8年 带他们两个下去 You will go to prison for eight years. Take them down.

270
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,760
全体起立 All rise.

-午饭时间我过来看你 -谢谢你 谢谢你 -午饭时 -I'll be down at lunchtime to see you. -Thank you thank you. -Lunchtime.

272
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,800
噢! Oh!

273
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,520
-混蛋 你给我下套 -我能怎么做呢? -You set me up you bastard. -What was I supposed to do?

274
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,680
-难道预先通知你? -你就是要打击我 -Tell you in advance? -You knew you were going to cut my throat.

275
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,130
我只是在尽本分 做当事人的代表和解读诉讼状 Doing my job representing my client reading the brief.

276
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:15,960
你别多想  Don't take it personally.

277
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,230
想那么多 这个律师还当不当阿? Where would we all be if we took things personally? 

278
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,520
你别以为高我一等  Don't patronize me.

279
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,170
不是吗? 你像个孩子一样 Why not? You're behaving like a child. 

280
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,240
明显是你没有看过补充证据通告 You clearly hadn't read the NAEs.

281
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,000
让我猜猜看 文件还没开封 Let me guess still at home 

282
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
静躺在你家地板上不知道哪个角落 an unopened file lying on the floor somewhere?

283
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,680
你知道自己没有做好本分工作 You didn't do your job properly you know it 

284
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,760
这才是你发火的原因 that's why you're cross.

285
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,760
-天杀的 她给判了14年 -这是谁的错? -She just got 14 years for God's sake. -Whose fault is that? 

286
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,720

-渴望已久的推荐信 -非常好 -'Reference to die for I'd think.' -Very good sir.

292
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,920
有245名女性披上丝袍 245 women Silks ever.

293
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,400
从成千上万个人中脱颖而出 Ever. Out of tens of thousands.

294
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,560
现在我们不得不敬重这个统计数据 Now boys you've got to respect a statistic like that.

295
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:10,800
在丝袍界里 一个女人要单挑十二个男人 And it's still 12 male QC's to every Doris.

296
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:15,120
我就说嘛 这是怎么一个比率啊?Jake 嗯? I mean what are the odds Jake? Hmm?

297
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,480
您尊驾惠临真是我们的荣幸 Costello小姐 Kind of you to grace us with your presence Miss Costello.

298
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,240
抱歉 法官大人 我在别的法庭耽搁了 I'm sorry my Lord I was detained in another court.

299
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,040
重头戏前的空档不忘赚点小钱? Nice little earner before the main act? 

300
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,420
收90英镑 减掉给助理的费用 About 90 Pounds minus clerk's fees

301
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:33,960
办公室租金 交通费用 税金 增值税 大概还剩12.50镑 chambers rent travel tax VAT so that leaves about 12.50 Pounds.

302
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,560
赚钱能力真不咋滴 而且迟到完全是我的错 So not much of an earner really but entirely my fault I'm late.

303
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:42,040
昨日是一场硬仗 你还是赢了 Good result yesterday against the odds.

304
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,040
陪审团的判断总是明智的 Well the jury's always right.

305
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,040
我们可以开始宣誓了吗? Let's swear one in shall we?

306
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,840
其实 我还没跟被告谈过 Actually I haven't had a chance to speak to the defendant.

307
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,600
-五分钟 -多给一点点? -Five minutes. -A little longer?

308
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,880
四分三十秒 开始计时 Four and a half and counting.

309
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,680
明明白白地告诉我 你不在现场 Just confirm for me 100% you weren't there 

310
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,920
你从来没到过那地方 凶手不是你 you've never been there it wasn't you?

311
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,720
说 是还是不是? Look...yes or no?

312
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,360
那不是我 It wasn't me.

313
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,960
你没做过? You didn't do this?

314

所以说他通过视频指认的时候错认了你? So he was mistaken when he picked you out in a video ID?

315
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,680
我知道你想怎样 Look I know what you're doing.

316
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:32,000
难倒你了吧 知道自己还不够格 就想哄我认罪 You're up against it you're out of your depth so you're leaning on me to plead guilty.

317
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,680
我不会那样干 I don't do that.

318
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,720
只要你告诉我你是无辜 我就为你拼了 You tell me you didn't do this and I will fight for you.

319
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,960

00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,600
一起化压力为动力 We all perform better under pressure.

322
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:59,920
Dodds先生 你可以慢慢说 Take as much time as you need Mr Dodds.

323
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,320
他打了我三次 He hit me three times.

324
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,960
每隔三分钟 他就走向我 Every three minutes he'd just walk over to me

325
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,240
系紧我的椅子 挥拳打我的脸 tied up in my chair and punch me in the face.

326
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,000
不急不忙地 Wasn't in any hurry.

327
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,160
你可以列出被偷的东西吗? Have you been able to establish what was stolen?

328

我亡妻的珠宝 我的婚戒 My late wife's jewellery my wedding ring.

329
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,240

他偷了我的勋章 He stole my medal.

333
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,320
-你是怎样获得勋章的? -诺曼底 -How did you win the medal? -Normandy.

334
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,400
在1944年6月4日的晚上 Night of June 4th 1944.

335
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:46,360
在诺曼底登陆前 我们空降到已被占领的法国 We dropped into occupied France ahead of the beach landings.

336
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,000
我... And I...

337
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,200
我 呃... I er...

338
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,760
救出一个受伤的战友 brought a wounded comrade in.

339
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,960
你有多少时间看着作案者? How much time did you get to look at the intruder?

340
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,200
-13分钟 -为什么如此精确? -13 minutes. -How are you able to be so precise?

341
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,240
墙上挂着钟 There's a clock on the wall.

342
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,800
因为警方 The police

343
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,760
不是就爱问一些时间之类是事情么? like to know about the time of everything don't they? So

344
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,840
我就多看几眼 I thought I should keep an eye on it.

345
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,680
作案者穿着什么衣服? What was the intruder wearing?

346
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,800
他戴着摩托车头盔 He had a motorcycle helmet on.

347
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,800
后来他给摘掉了 Then he took it off.

348
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,160
下面还戴了一个巴拉克拉法帽 He had a sort of balaclava on underneath

349
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,310
就像F1赛车选手在头盔下戴了那个帽子 like the ones Formula 1 drivers wear under their helmets 

350
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,160
他一直戴着那帽 and he kept that on.

351
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,000
休庭五分钟 Five minute break.

352
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,800

353
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:36,020
-入室盗窃有很多种 -对 -Lots of form for burglary. -Yes.

354

-那? -Nick 够了 -So? -Yes Nick?

355
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:43,020
那...不能因为他以前犯过类似的错误 So... just because he's done this kind of thing before

356
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:48,050
-就说他这次有罪吧 -没定罪 就是清白 -doesn't make him guilty this time. -Innocent until proven guilty.

357
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:51,040
我就靠这几个字活的 Four words to live by.

358
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:56,040
但你怎么认为? But what do you think?

359
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,050
-你会明白的 -明白什么? -It'll happen to you. -What will?

360
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:04,020
如果被告有罪 辩护律师是知道的 Well all defence counsels know when a defendant's guilty.

361
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:07,040
但审判中途他们经常会忘记 But by halfway through a trial they always forget.

362
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:12,000
-你视力怎么样? -还行 -How good is your eyesight? -It's fine.

363
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:16,090
你在警察局进行了疑犯指认程序 You attended an ID procedure at the police station

364
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:21,090
过程中你要求离屏幕近儿点坐 and during that procedure you made a request to sit nearer to the screen.

365
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:23,060
我想看清眼睛 I wanted to look at the eyes.

366
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,030
形状和颜色 Their shape their colour.

367
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:28,080
当他在公寓时 我想 你有两刷子啊 When he was in the flat I thought "You're good

368
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,930
虽然没有留下什么证据 "you're not giving me anything here

369
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:34,050
但你确让我记住了你的眼睛  but for one thing - your eyes.

370
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,060
我就要靠这个抓住你 "I'm going to get you on that."

371
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:40,080
你挺为你自己的老而弥坚而自豪 You pride yourself on being sprightly for your age.

372
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:46,020
你或许不太乐意承认你的身体机能 You might not be very good at admitting that your faculties

373
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,060
已经不如从前了 are working less well now than they were.

374
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:51,050
一天一天衰退的视力让你感到懊恼吧 You're raging against the dying of the light.

375
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:54,080
Costello女士 我还没有瞎呢 My light is not dying Miss Costello.

376
00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:00,020
他就是在我公寓的那个男人! 我没有认错! That was the man in my flat and I'm not mistaken about it.

377
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:03,070
Dodd先生 那你听到他说什么了吗?  How's your hearing Mr Dodd? 

378
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,050
他没说过话 一次也没有 He didn't speak. Not once.

379
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:08,060
您能看一下您的证人供词吗? Will you look at your witness statement?

380
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:11,030
在第二页的倒数第三行文字 It's three lines from the bottom of the second page.

381
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:15,030
-上面说了什么? -上面说 -What does it say? -It says

382
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:18,070
作案者没有特别的口音 "The intruder had no particular accent."

383
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:23,010
Dodd先生 但你刚才告诉陪审团他没有说话 You've just told this jury that he didn't speak Mr Dodd.

384
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:26,010
那你怎么知道作案者操什么口音? So how do you know what accent the intruder actually had?

385
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,080
他哼哼唧唧的 He hummed.

386
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,000
他在我公寓的所有时间 The whole time he was in my flat.

387
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,020
他一直在哼哼唧唧 He only stopped humming

388
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,070
除了他打我的时候 when he was hitting me.

389
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,050
那你的证人供词上提及了吗? Is that in your witness statement?

390
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:46,010
没 No.

391
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:50,010
证人供词的重点 The whole point of a witness statement

392
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:52,080
难道不就是告诉警方事实真相么? is to tell the whole truth to the police isn't it?

393
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:56,020
那你为什么没提及他一直在哼哼唧唧 So why didn't you mention he was humming?

394
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:02,040
我不想让他看上去像个疯子 I didn't want him to seem like he was mad.

395
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,020
什么意思? I beg your pardon?

396
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,020
我想让他去正规的监狱 I'd like him to go to a proper prison.

397
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,590
噢 我明白了 Oh I see. 

398
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:14,060
你要让你认为的凶手在检察官面前别无选择? No soft option for the man you believe did this to you?

399
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:19,050
我不想让他被关到住精神病人的地方 I don't want him going into a home for the mentally ill.

400
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:24,030
警方一逮捕嫌疑人 你就认以为警方抓对了人 The police have made an arrest and you've assumed they've got the right man

401
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:29,090
而现在你只是想给他定罪并且施以惩罚 and now you want to make sure he's convicted and above all punished.

402
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:33,000
Costello女士 你是在问问题还是在做演讲 Is this a question or a speech Miss Costello?

403
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,010
那上面坐的不是被告 This defendant wasn't there.

404
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:40,040
Dodd先生 你认错人了 You've got the wrong man Mr Dodd.

405
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:44,080
我妻子就是在精神病患之家去死 My wife died in a home for the mentally ill.

406
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:50,000
她最后是穿着尿布死的 She had to wear nappies at the end.

407
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,080
当她走的时候 她的尿布都3天没有换过了 When she died her nappy hadn't been changed for three days.

408
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:59,090

600
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:48,720
被告有可能在你看的DVD里面 也有可能不在 The defendant may or may not be present in the DVD you are watching.

601
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,280
哪个是他? Which one is he?

602
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,960

00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,720
-为什么? -我不知道 -Why? -I don't know.

604
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,160
我每天过去三次 I come in three times a day.

605
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,860
早上帮Dodd先生穿衣服 I help Mr Dodd to get dressed in the morning 

606
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:12,760
帮他准备午饭 晚上侍候他就寝 I give him his lunch and then I help him get to bed at night.

607
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,360
那晚他在床上之后 And when you left him that evening he was in bed 

608
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,000
你离开的时候是不是一切如常? and everything was as it should be? 

609
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,360
是的 Yes.

610
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,360
无需提问 No questions.

611
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,320
不不 对不起 就一个问题 Oh actually sorry just one sorry.

612
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,520
你离开的时候关门了吗? Did you close the door behind you?

613
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,160
嗯 肯定关了 Yes of course.

614
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,680
谢谢 Thank you.

615
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:46,080
被告住的地方离犯罪现场很近 The defendant lives a short distance away from the scene of the crime.

616
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,320
你逮捕他是不是因为 And you arrested him because

617
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:52,320
闭路电视录像出现一个骑着摩托车的男人 there is CCTV footage of a man on a Vespa

618
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,680
在抢劫案发生后 leaving from outside Mr Dodd's home address

619
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,360
从Dodd先生家离开 just after the burglary took place?

620
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,640
被告有一辆摩托车 The defendant owns a Vespa.

621
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,560
这个录像不能完全证明事实 但是... The footage isn't good enough for us to identify it 100% but...

622
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,640
是怀疑的理由 也是逮捕的根据? Grounds for suspicion. Grounds for arrest?

623
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,480
是的 Yes.

624
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:13,680
在被告公寓里有无发现任何被盗财物? Was any of the stolen property recovered from the defendant's flat?

625
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,280
-没有 -任何与盗窃案相关的东西呢? -No. -Any paraphernalia associated with burglary?

626
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,840
这些东西很容易处理掉 These things are easily disposed of.

627
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,720
请根据证据说话 警官 不要假设 Stick to the evidence officer not supposition.

628
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:25,320
这个假设是根据我25年的经验 It's supposition based on 25 years of experience.

629
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,400
接下来是疑犯的展示 关键一击 Then came the ID parade. Slam dunk.

630
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,080
在此之前你还都没出席过庭审 You haven't been in the court until now

631
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:38,640
所以你不会知道Dodd先生在证人席上说的 so you won't know what Mr Dodd said in the witness box

632
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:43,600
但是你可能听说过打哈欠这回事了 but you will have heard about the...yawn moment?

633
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,320
这...太恐怖了 It's...chilling.

634
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,320
殴打了老人之后再打哈欠 Torture an old man and then yawn.

635
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,400
他这是厌倦了? 累了? Was he bored? Tired?

636
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,520
你早已认为被告会有这种行为? And this is the kind of behaviour you'd expect from this defendant?

637
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:04,120
Costello女士 请搞清楚你在做什么 Do you have any idea what you're doing Miss Costello?

638
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,440
被告是否有前科? Is it right that this defendant has previous convictions?

639
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,840
其中包括三次盗窃行为? Including three previous convictions for burglary?

640
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,880
是的 Yes.

641
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:23,120
能说一下Rush先生在那些犯罪中获得的判刑吗? Can you tell us about the sentences Mr Rush received for those offences?

642
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:28,240
第一次缓刑 第二次社区服务80个小时 Probation the first time 80 hours community service the second time

643
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,760
第三次是六个月监禁 followed by six months in prison.

644
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:33,360
根据你25年的经验 In 25 years of experience

645
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:37,880
-你对那些判决有什么看法? -太短了 -how do you feel about those sentences? -Too short.

646
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,770
根据你25年的经验 In 25 years of experience

647
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:44,800
要是一个人打哈欠 并用戴着手套的手  if a man yawns and puts his gloved hand

648
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,880
捂住嘴 之后又用同一只手 up to his mouth and then with the same hand

649
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:52,640
通过门的把手开门 我们会在把手上发现什么呢 opens the door using the handle what will we find on the handle?

650
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:59,280
DNA 在哪? DNA. Where is it?

651
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,480
-谁是第一个到达犯罪现场的警官? -是我 -Who was the first officer to arrive on the scene of the crime? -I was.

652
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,160
那是在犯罪现场调查员和法医人员到达公寓前 This was before the SOCOs long before forensics had got to the flat.

653
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,440
检测门把手的时候 有没有发现指纹? When the door handle was tested were any fingerprints found?

654
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,880
-没有 -一个也没有? -No. -None?

655
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,880
一个门把手却没有任何指纹？ A door handle with nobody's prints on it?

656
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:27,120
没有Dodd先生的指纹? 没有社工一小时前留下的指纹? Not Mr Dodd's? Not the Social Worker from an hour before?

657
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,720
Dodd先生很明确地说 入侵者打哈欠了 Mr Dodd couldn't have been clearer. The intruder yawned.

658
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:37,080
他在打哈欠时抬起戴着手套的手捂住了嘴 He put his gloved hand up to his face to cover his yawn.

659
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:40,520
又用同一只手拧着门把开了门 He opened the door with the same hand using the handle.

660
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,400
凭借你多年来丰富的经验 警官 Gather up all your experience Officer

661
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,560
平息怒气冷静地推敲一下这个细节 bring it to the front of your mind and park it next to your anger

662
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:51,880
告诉陪审团这个门把 在检验前被清理过 and tell this jury that someone didn't wipe the handle clean before it was tested.

663
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:58,920
你诬陷被告 因为你对他本没有好感 You've fitted up this defendant because you don't like him.

664
00:45:58,920 --> 00:45:59,920
他累积的犯罪记录 He's got form and 

665
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,650
在你们警察的眼中便意味着 in your policeman's mind 

666
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:04,640
他应该受到更严厉的惩罚 he hasn't been properly punished.

667
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,280
那Dodd先生为何指认他呢? 嗯? So how did Mr Dodd pick him out? Hey?

668
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,080
如果你说不是他? If it wasn't him?

669
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:17,840
1只短吻鳄 2只短吻鳄 3只短吻鳄 4只短吻鳄 One alligator two alligator three alligator four alligator.

670
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:24,400
1只短吻鳄 2只短吻鳄 3只短吻鳄 4只短吻鳄 One alligator two alligator three alligator four alligator

671
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,000
5只短吻鳄 6只... five alligator six...

672
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,920
非常精彩 That was something.

673
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:42,120
实在是精彩之极 That was really something.

674
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:47,200
你们已经看到了用于指认程序的DVD You've seen the DVD of the ID procedure.

675
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,680
你们也听到了受害人以他自己 You've heard the victim count in his very own

676
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,240
独特而精确的方式来计算 very particular very precise way

677
00:46:55,240 --> 00:47:00,680
Gary Rush出现在屏幕上的时间比别人多出了两秒 the fact that Gary Rush is on that screen for two seconds

678
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:04,960
或者说多数了2只短吻鳄 比其他人的时间都长 or alligators longer than everyone else.

679
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:10,960
你们都看到屏幕上每一次只显示一张照片 You've seen the black screen either side of only one image on that video.

680
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,280
控方所依靠的唯一证据 The only evidence this prosecution relies on

681
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:20,560
是Dodd先生在嫌疑人照片中指认了被告 is Mr Dodd picking out the defendant on an ID parade.

682
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,520
不仅缺少法医证据 Not only is there no forensic evidence

683
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,800
而且原来提出的法医证据 已失去说服力 there is evidence of there being no forensic evidence

684
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,360
坦白说 这令人难以信服 which frankly is impossible.

685
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:36,080
如果Gary Rush当时的确在公寓里打了哈欠 If Gary Rush was in that flat and he yawned

686
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:40,960
他的DNA就会遗留在门把上 then his DNA would be on that door handle.

687
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,720
仅凭这点证据能够证明 Is it safe to convict this man

688
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,520
这个人有罪吗? on this evidence?

689
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,760
作为陪审团你们担负着神圣的使命 You as a jury have a sacred task.

690
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,200
你们的工作就是运用整个司法体系 It is your job to apply the one basic principle

691
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,920
赖以运作的一条基本原则 on which everything in our justice system turns.

692
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,060
控方必须拿出真凭实据 The prosecution have to prove 

693
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:07,760
消除一切合理怀疑来证明被告有罪 beyond all reasonable doubt that a defendant is guilty.

694
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,340
回到你们的仲裁室 Go back to your jury room 

695
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:14,880
将此原则应用于这些事实之中 and apply that principle to these facts

696
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:19,880
然后回来作出唯一公正的裁决 and come back with the only proper verdict.

697
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:23,600
Gary Rush无罪 Gary Rush is not guilty.

698
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,480
-三次因盗窃罪被判刑 -我们已经讨论过这个了 -Three convictions for burglary. -We've had this conversation.

699
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,640
显然 去年他另一桩盗窃案被判无罪 But obviously his acquittal last year for another burglary

700
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,160
不在犯罪前科的单子上 你没有提到这一点 isn't on the list of previous. But it is in the unused.

701
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,440
那是因为他被判无罪了 Nick That's because it's an acquittal Nick.

702
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,360
也或许是因为受害人的头部遭受了三次重击 Or because the victim was punched three times in the head

703
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:45,200
直至最后也没能作证 and bottled out of giving evidence at the last minute.

704
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,240
你怎么看待这个呢?  What does that tell you? 

705
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:50,040
Scarrow警司有明显的动机要诬陷Gary Rush That D.S. Scarrow has a classic motive for fitting up Gary Rush.

706
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,000
他擅入犯罪现场 That he walked into this crime 

707
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:57,000
还主观地排除了Rush或许不是真凶的可能性 and removed any possibility from his mind that Rush might not be the right man.

708
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,400
这事关司法公正 Nick It's about integrity of justice Nick.

709
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:06,440
为了人们得到公正的审判 就是这样 这非常重要 It's about people getting a fair trial and that's all there is and it matters so much.

710
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,280
-Costello小姐? -有裁决了? -Miss Costello? -Verdict?

711
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,160
被告人请起立 Will the defendant please stand.

712
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,480
陪审团团长请起立 Will the foreman please stand.

713
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:37,640
-你们作出一致的裁决了吗? -是的 -Have you reached a verdict upon which all of you are agreed? -Yes.

714
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:43,840
你们裁定被告人犯有恶性盗窃罪吗? Do you find the defendant guilty or not guilty of aggravated burglary?

715
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:46,520
-无罪 -太好了! -Not guilty. -Yes!

716
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,440
有两件事是真的 These two things are true.

717
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:21,200
Gary Rush令人生厌 而他免于处罚也是正确的 Gary Rush is a horrible man and it's right that he gets off.

718
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,960
两者之间并不矛盾 They are not mutually exclusive.

719
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,560
我们去看看Mercedes Cordoba Let's go and see Mercedes Cordoba.

721

他们总是一起来 当我怀孕以后 Always all of them so that when I was pregnant

725
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:46,000
他们都不知道谁是孩子的父亲 they wouldn't know who the father was.

726
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,640
等到我肚子越来越大 When my belly grew bigger

727
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:54,480
他们就让我吞下毒品 they made me swallow the drugs

728
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,760
然后飞去伦敦 and I flew to London.

729
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,320
你的孩子们现在在哪? Where are your children?

730
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,040
每次孩子出生后 Every time the baby was born

731
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,080
他们就把婴儿带走 they took the baby away.

732
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,480
三个男孩 Three boys.

733
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,520
两个女孩 Two girls.

734
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,640
然后他们再次开始轮奸我 And then they raped me again.

735
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,600
我不知道我的孩子们在哪 I don't know where my babies are.

736
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,880
你之前为什么不告诉我呢? Why didn't you tell me this?

737
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,160
我本可以用这点来帮你 I could have used it.

738
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:32,520
我想要一个长时间的判刑 I wanted a long sentence.

739
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,400
在这里我是安全的 Here I am safe.

我摆脱了他们 I am away from them.

00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,480
我们有上诉的理由 There is a ground of appeal.

742
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,760
你怎么还不明白呢? Why can't you hear me?

743

我不想上诉 I do not want an appeal.

上诉的理由是什么? What was the ground of appeal?

746
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,160
我 我的不作为 Me. Me being hopeless.

747
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:22,800
Gary Rush可不认为你不作为 Gary Rush doesn't think you're hopeless.

748
