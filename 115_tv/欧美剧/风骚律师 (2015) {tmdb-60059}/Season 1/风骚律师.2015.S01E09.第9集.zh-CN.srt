1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,100
pervious on EIl stone

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,800
??

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,800
???

4
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,700
??

5
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,100
???

6
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,000
Wow

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,200
-??
-???

8
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,000
???

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,600
??

10
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,200
-???
-??

11
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,800
??

12
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,800
???

13
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,000
??

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,200
I WON'T HAVE ANYTHING LEFT
TO LIVE FOR ANYWAY.

15
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,900
THERE'S GOTTA BE
A LESS HUMILIATING OUTFIT--

16
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,200
SOMETHING THAT CLOSES
IN THE BACK, AT LEAST.

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,500
I OVERHEARD
ONE OF THE NURSES SAYING

18
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,000
SHE THOUGHT
YOUR BUTT WAS CUTE.

19
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,500
COME ON.
DON'T BE NERVOUS.

20
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,200
ALL WE'RE DOING IS TALKING
ABOUT SURGERY ON MY BRAIN.

21
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,400
WHAT'S THERE
TO BE NERVOUS ABOUT?

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,800
-BLINDNESS.
-COMA.

23
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,400
LONG-TERM MEMORY LOSS.

24
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,000
SURE, I CAN REMOVE IT.
IT'S NO BIGGIE.

25
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,400
YOU'VE FOUND YOUR MAN.

26
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,200
REALLY?

27
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,700
-THAT'S FANTASTIC
-TOLD YOU.

28
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,800
JUST OUT OF CUOSITY,

29
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,600
HOW ATTACHED ARE YOU
TO YOUR ABILITY TO SPEAK?

30
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,400
SO I'D BE A VEGETABLE.

31
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,000
I WOULDN'T USE
THE WORD "VEGETABLE."

32
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,900
WELL, I WAS COMBINING
BLINDNESS, PARALYSIS

33
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,600
AND PERMANENT BRAIN DAMAGE INTO
ONE EASY-TO-REMEMBER CATEGORY.

34
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,800
DIDN'T YOU MENTION SOME HOSPITAL
IN CHINA? TIN-TIN PUMA?

35
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,800
TIANTAN PUHUA.

36
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,000
AND THE NEWS WON'T SOUND
ANY BETTER IN MANDARIN.

37
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,600
LOOK, ELI, 

38
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,600
ARE YOU SURE THIS
IS SOMETHING YOU REALLY WANT?

39
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,800
IF THE SOMETHING IS ENDING UP
A DROOLING IDIOT, THEN NO.

40
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,300
BUT IF IT MEANS GETTING
THE BRAIN DEFECT REMOVED FROM MY HEAD 

41
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,400
THAT'S MAKING
MY LIFE A LIVING HELL, THEN YES.

42
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,500
WELL, THE GOOD NEWS IS YOU'RE ????

43
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,900
SO THE ONLY THING
LEFT TO DO

44
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,100
IS PICK A SURGEON
FOR THE OTHER THING.

45
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,200
OUT OF THOSE GUYS?

46
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,500
THEY DIDN'T SEEM LIKE THEY
COULD REMOVE A CAP FROM A PEN.

47
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,800
THEY'RE THE BEST NEUROSURGEONS ???

48
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,400
WELL, NOW LET'S TRY THE ONES
THAT YOU COULDN'T GET ME IN WITH.

49
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,400
ALL RIGHT, THERE'S ONE--

50
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,800
???

51
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,000
BUT HE DOESN'T TAKE WALK-INS.

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,500
HE ONLY HANDLES CASES ORIGINATING
FROM HIS OWN HOSPITAL.

53
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,300
OR HE DID,
UNTIL YOU APPLIED YOUR
COPIOUS POWERS OF PERSUASION.

54
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,100
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
??

55
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,800
YOU'RE THE BEST. 
THANK YOU.

56
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,900
MM, doN'T THANK ME.

57
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,800
I JUST DON'T WANT TO SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE
WIPING DROOL OFF YOUR CHIN.

58
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,400
BETH?

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,100
ELI!

60
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,100
HI!

61
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,500
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
AT THE HOSPITAL?

62
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,100
I, UM... I'M SORRY. 

63
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,900
I JUST DIDN'T
EXPECT TO SEE YOU.

64
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,200
OH. BEN.

65
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,900
I'M BRINGING BEN
TO THE DOCTOR.

66
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,100
YOU KNOW
HE'S NOT WITH YOU, RIGHT?

67
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,100
YES, HE'S...
AT THE PSYCHOLOGIST.

68
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,000
THEY WORK ONE-ON-ONE FOR
AN HOUR, INDIVIDUAL COUNSELING.

69
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,200
SO HOW ARE YOU?
I SAW YOU ON THE NEWS.

70
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,100
I WAS GONNA CALL,
BUT I FIGURED, YOU KNOW,

71
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,500
YOU HAVE ENOUGH
ON YOUR PLATE.

72
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,700
YEAH, I'VE BEEN BETTER.
I, UH... I GOT DEMOTED.

73
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,200
I LOST MY OFFICE.

74
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,600
I HAD A FIGHT WITH MY
ACUPUNCTURIST/SPIRITUAL GUIDE.

75
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,700
I ALIENATED THE ONE PERSON
AT WORK WHO MISTAKENLY ADMIRED ME

76
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,300
AND MADE A SERIOUS ETHICAL BREACH
WHICH HELPED GET SEVERAL HUNDRED PEOPLE

77
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,700
KICKED OUT
OF THEIR HOMES...

78
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,300
AND I-I BROKE UP
WITH TAYLOR.

79
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,300
OH, WOW.

80
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,700
THAT'S...

81
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,600
OH, ELI.

82
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,400
IF YOU EVER NEED TO TALK,

83
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,300
YOU STILL HAVE MY NUMBER,
RIGHT?

84
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,300
YEAH.

85
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,500
I MIGHT JUST GIVE YOU
A CALL.

86
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,600
OKAY.

87
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
BYE.

88
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:18,200
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com present</font>

89
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,400
<font color="#ffff00">Capture:FRM@优雅的冰
Sync:FRM@爱笑的眼睛 花~</font>

90
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,700
YOU'LL NEVER GUESS
WHO I RAN INTO.

91
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,000
COME ON, PATTI,
GUESS.

92
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,600
YOU'RE NOT PATTI.

93
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,600
NO, UM, I'M BRADLEY KITSIS.
I'M YOUR TEMP.

94
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,300
WHERE'S PATTI?

95
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,500
SHE'S NOT HERE.

96
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,300
I NOTICED. I CAN SEE, BRADLEY,
AT LEAST FOR NOW.

97
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,800
OH, SHE LEFT ME THIS NOTE
TO READ TO YOU.

98
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,800
UH, "ELI, I'M TAKING
A PERSONAL WEEK..."

99
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,400
PERSONAL WEEK?

100
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,100
"TO LOOK AFTER MY FRIENDS
AND RELATIVES IN SILVER TERRACE

101
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,500
WHO THANKS TO YOU,
NOW HAVE NO HOMES." 

102
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,600
"NO HOMES" IS IN CAPITAL
LETTERS, WHICH IS WHY I...

103
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,100
THANKS, BRAD.
I GOT IT.

104
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,600
OUR BILLABLES
ARE UP BY 10% THIS QUARTER--

105
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,500
AN INCREASE ALMOST ENTIRELY DUE TO
OUR SUCCESS IN THE SOLINSKY CASE.

106
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,600
I CAN'T HELP BUT SWELL
WITH FATHERLY PRIDE.

107
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,500
I HAD A LOT OF HELP.

108
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,200
PERHAPS YOU'D BE WILLING
TO APPLY YOUR DEFT TOUCH TO JUDGE DOYLE.

109
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,300
-THIS BEING DOYLE "THE IL."
-GOOD LUCK.

110
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,000
JUDGE DOYLE
HAS JUST RETAINED W.P.K. 

111
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,300
IN CONNECTION
WITH A PERSONAL MEDICAL CRISIS.

112
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,300
IS HE FINALLY GETTING THE POLE
REMOVED FROM HIS RECTUM?

113
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,200
I HEAR THAT CAN BE
A PAINFUL PROCEDURE.

114
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,300
NOT NEARLY AS PAINFUL
AS LEUKEMIA, MR. DOWD.

115
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,600
JUDGE DOYLE NEEDS A BONE MARROW
TRANSPLANT TO TREAT HIS CANCER,

116
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,500
BUT HIS ONLY DONOR MATCH BACKED
OUT OF THE DONATION AGREEMENT YESTERDAY.

117
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,300
AND NOW THAT WE'VE ESTABLISHED
YOUR SENSITIVITY

118
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,400
TO THE JUDGE'S PLIGHT,
YOU CAN ASSIST TAYLOR.

119
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,400
SIR, DOYLE THE--

120
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,700
UH, JUDGE DOYLE HATES ME. 

121
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,600
I'M SURE YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH MY
"I COULD CARE LESS" FACE.

122
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,400
MOVING ON TO OTHER
OUTSTANDING BUSINESS...

123
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,800
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN--

124
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,300
MR. GEORGE MICHAEL!

125
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,500
OH, NO.
IT'S NOT.

126
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,200
OH, NO,
IT'S NOT WHAT?

127
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,300
ARE YOU ELI STONE?

128
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,700
I'M GEORGE MICHAEL.

129
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,500
WOULD--WOULD YOU MIND
NOT POKING ME, PLEASE?

130
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,200
WELL, I'M SORRY,
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,

131
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,000
YOU'RE VERY SOLID
FOR A VISION.

132
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,600
AND YOU'RE A VERY ODD MAN.

133
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
WELL, AT LEAST
I'M NOT A HALLUCINATION.

134
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,400
WELL, HE CAN SEE ME.

135
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,600
ADLEY, DO YOU SEE ME
TALKING TO ANYONE? 

136
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,300
REAL LIFE?
ACTUAL PERSON?

137
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,400
OF COURSE I DO, SIR.
THAT'S BONO.

138
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,100
YEAH, IT HAPPENS
ALL THE TIME.

139
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,000
I HAD THE GLASSES FIRST,
BY THE WAY.

140
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,500
MIND YOU, BONO AND I DO
HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON

141
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,100
IN THAT WE ARE BOTH
PERFECTLY VISIBLE.

142
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,500
I'M SORRY. I THINK I'VE BEEN
WASTING YOUR TIME, MR. STONE.

143
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,500
NO, NO, NO. PLEASE, PLEASE,
PLEASE, UH, STAY.

144
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,000
I... I'M SORRY.
I JUST DON'T--

145
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,500
I DON'T TYPICALLY
GET VISITS LIKE THIS ONE.

146
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,600
UM... 

147
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,600
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU,
MR. MICHAEL?

148
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,700
CALL ME GEORGE. UM, WELL, I WANT
YOU TO TAKE A CASE FOR ME.

149
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,500
??

150
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,600
IT'S ABOUT A YOUNG GIRL WHO WAS
THROWN OUT OF HER HIGH SCHOOL

151
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,600
FOR PLAYING ONE OF MY SONGS AT
A SCHOOL "ABSTINENCE" ASSEMBLY.

152
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,300
OF COURSE.
THIS WAS ALL OVER THE NEWS.

153
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,600
WHAT WAS THE SONG AGAIN?

154
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,000
UH, "I WANT YOUR SEX."

155
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,900
SORRY, YOU'RE NOT MY TYPE.
IT WAS A JOKE.

156
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,900
ANYWAY, UH, I WANT TO HIRE YOU
TO HELP HER GET BACK IN.

157
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,300
NOW OBVIOUSLY I'LL COVER
ALL THE LEGAL FEES, MR. STONE.

158
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,900
CALL ME ELI,
AND THIS IS ???

159
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:01,300
OBVIOUSLY, I WOULDN'T, UH...
I COULDN'T SAY NO TO YOU.

160
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,000
SO...

161
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,100
IF YOU DON'T MIND ME ASKING...

162
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,000
MM-HMM?

163
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,500
WHY ME?

164
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,000
WHY DID YOU COME TO ME?

165
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,100
WELL, YOU MIGHT THINK
I'M THE ODD ONE NOW.

166
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,800
BUT THE OTHER NIGHT
I HAD A DREAM,

167
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,300
AND, UM, IN THE DREAM,
I WAS COMPLETELY LOST,

168
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,000
UH, WHEN SOMEONE TOLD ME
I NEEDED TO FIND A LAWYER

169
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,600
NAMED ELI STONE.

170
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,000
Eli Stone 
 S01 Ep09

171
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,000
MR. WETHERSBY?

172
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,400
YOU WERE LOOKING FOR ME,
SIR?

173
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,100
THAT WOULD BE INCONSISTENT
WITH THE TERMINATION

174
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,200
OF OUR RELATIONSHIP,
NOW WOULDN'T IT?

175
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,800
I JU HEARD THAT YOU WANTED
TO SEE ME, SIR.

176
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,500
MAYBE BRADLEY
MEANT MR. POSNER.

177
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,700
NO, HE MEANT ME. 

178
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,000
I JUST
DIDN'T WANT YOU INFERRING

179
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
THAT I ACTUALLY CRAVED
THIS CONVERSATION.

180
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,600
NEVERTHELESS, I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU'VE BEEN RETAINED

181
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,200
BY--WHO WAS IT AGAIN?

182
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,700
GEORGE MICHAEL,
THE POP SUPERSTAR?

183
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,900
YES, SIR, UNLESS THERE'S
A PROBLEM WITH THAT.

184
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,000
THERE IS, ACTUALLY--
TWO PROBLEMS, IN FACT.

185
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,600
FOR ONE THING,
YOU'RE STILL ON PROBATION.

186
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,100
SECONDLY, SECTION 6.3 PARAGRAPH
"J" OF THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT

187
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,300
OBLIGATES A PARTNER
TO OVERSEE ANY CASE

188
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,500
WHERE THE CLIENT HAS
A HIGH PUBLIC PROFILE.

189
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,600
WELL, I GUESS IT'S GOOD THEN

190
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,400
THAT GEORGE
ISN'T TECHNICALLY THE CLIENT.

191
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,800
HER NAME IS MOLLY FOSTER.

192
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,500
SHS 17
AND MUCH LESS FAMOUS, SIR.

193
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,700
I DON'T HAVE ALL DAY
TO WASTE ON SEMANTICS.

194
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,200
IF SOMEONE OF MR. MICHAEL'S
ESTEEM IS INVOLVED IN THIS CASE,

195
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,000
THEN OBVIOUSLY THE REQUIREMENT
TO OVERSEE APPLIES.

196
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,500
INCLUDING APPEARING IN COURT?

197
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,700
AND MANAGING
CLIENT RELATIONS, YES.

198
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,500
OKAY, THEN.
WELCOME TO THE CASE.

199
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,400
I'M SURE MR. MICHAEL WILL APPRECIATE
HAVING A SENIOR PARTNER ON HIS TEAM.

200
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,800
AS WILL MOLLY, SIR.

201
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,800
WHO?

202
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,000
OUR CLIENT,
MOLLY FOSTER.

203
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,500
RIGHT. MM.

204
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,400
RIGHT.

205
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,500
<i>I DIDN'T EXPECT THIS
FROM JORDAN WETHERSBY.</i>

206
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,100
I ASK HIM TO SEND ME
HIS BEST LAWYERS.

207
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,600
HE SENDS ME A GIRL.

208
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,500
WELL, LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO
MR. WETHERSBY'S DAUGHTER, SIR.

209
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,000
<i>I WASN'T TALKING ABOUT HER,
DOWD.</i>

210
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,700
<i>GOOD TO SEE YOU, TAYLOR.</i>

211
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,200
SO LET'S GET TO IT.

212
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,100
SO YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE, UH,
LACK OF LEGAL PRECEDENT?

213
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,900
NO, I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE LACK
OF PRECEDENT IN OUR FAVOR.

214
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,700
WELL, THAT'S WHY I PAY
THE 2 OF YOU $550 AN HOUR.

215
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,500
I KNOW THIS IS A LONG SHOT,
BUT I HAVE NO CHOICE. I'M DYING.

216
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,400
LEUKEMIA PROESSED
TO STAGE FOUR.

217
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,700
NOWHERE TO GO BUT DOWN.

218
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,000
DID YOU TELL
THE WOULD-BE DONOR?

219
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,100
NO, MR. DOWD.

220
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,200
I WANT HIM TO THINK I NEED
THE PAINFUL EXTRACTIONS

221
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,600
OF HIS BONE MARROW
FOR MY PERSONAL COLLECTION.

222
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,500
USUALLY ONLY FAMILY MEMBERS
ARE AN EXACT MATCH.

223
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,700
THE WOULD-BE DONOR
IS A RELATIVE, ISN'T HE?

224
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,800
MY SON.

225
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,900
AND HE KNOWS YOU'RE DYING,
AND HE STILL WON'T HELP YOU?

226
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,500
WE AREN'T EXACTLY CLOSE.

227
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,400
HE WAS 2 WHEN
HIS MOTHER AND I DIVORCED,

228
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,000
AND I HAVEN'T SEEN SCOTT
SINCE THEN.

229
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,500
SO THE SETTLEMENT CONFERENCE
WE'RE SCHEDULED TO HAVE IN AN HOUR 

230
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,800
IS THE FIRST TIMEYOU'RE SEEG
YOUR SON IN 19 YEARS?

231
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,300
MM.

232
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,500
OKAY! 

233
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,300
I'LL HAVE ALL THE SHARP OBJECTS
REMOVED FROM THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

234
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,300
THIS IS
A CRITICAL MEETING, OBVIOUSLY.

235
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,800
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU
LET ME DO THE TALKING,

236
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,600
GET US OFF
ON THE RIGHT FOOT WITH MARY.

237
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,900
-MOLLY, SIR.
-UNDERSTANDABLY, SHE'LL BE
RELUCTANT TO DIVE...

238
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,600
-INTO THE LEGAL WATERS, BUT--
-ELI!

239
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,100
GEORGE, HELLO AGAIN.

240
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,300
I'M SORRY.
I'M NOT TOO LATE, AM I?

241
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,900
YOU'RE JUST OFF TO SEE MOLLY?

242
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,300
EXACTLY.
NO, YOU'RE JUST IN TIME.

243
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:26,900
COOL.

244
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,600
THIS IS THE FIRM'S SENIOR
PARTNER, JORDAN WETHERSBY.

245
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,500
HE'S GONNA BE TTING US OFF
ON THE RIGHT FOO

246
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,900
GOOD TO MEET YOU,???

247
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,000
YES, IT'S, UM...

248
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,100
AN HONOR, 
MR. MICHAEL.

249
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,600
YEAH. 
CALL ME GEORGE.

250
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,200
GEORGE.

251
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,800
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

252
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,900
YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE WE JUST
SAW EACH OTHER LAST WEEK.

253
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,500
WHY DON'T WE
ALL SIT DOWN?

254
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,300
HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE
TO REVIEW OUR PROPOSAL?

255
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,100
YES.

256
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
SCOTT?

257
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,000
THIS ISN'T...

258
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,500
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT THE MONEY.

259
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,900
WELL, UNLESS I'M MISTAKEN,
JUDGE DOYLE ALREADY PREVAILED

260
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,300
UPON YOUR MORE
NOBLE INSTINCTS.

261
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,700
I TOOK THE TEST.

262
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,600
DOCTORS STARTED TO DESCRIBE
THE PROCEDURE TO ME,

263
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,400
AND I GUESS
I HAD SECOND THOUGHTS, OKAY?

264
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,400
I'M SORRY.

265
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,400
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE
I EVEN KNOW YOU OR ANYTHING.

266
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,100
I KNOW. I KNOW,
AND I'M SORRY. I TRULY AM.

267
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,900
BUT I'M ASKING
FOR YOUR HELP HERE.

268
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,200
AND BELIEVE ME
WHEN I TELL YA,

269
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,500
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING
THAT COMES EASY FOR ME.

270
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:40,000
I WENT THROUGH THIS PHASE
WHERE I'D SEND YOU THINGS LETTERS,REPORT CARDS.

271
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,100
WHAT DID YOU EVER DO
WITH THOSE THINGS ANYWAY?

272
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,400
I THOUGHT...

273
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,400
I THOUGHT I SHOULDN'T PROMISE
A RELATIONSHIP I COULDN'T DELIVER ON.

274
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,400
YEAH.

275
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,300
YEAH, WELL, I GUESS
I CAN'T DELIVER NOW.

276
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,800
SORRY.

277
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,200
I DON'T THINK
WE'LL BE SETTLING.

278
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,800
YOU ARE A DEAD RINGER.

279
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,100
IT'S AMAZING.

280
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,100
MOM, YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS
GEORGE MICHAEL IMPERSONATOR CHLOE HIRED!

281
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,200
IT'S HILARIOUS.

282
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,700
HI, MOLLY.
IT'S GREAT TO MEET YOU.

283
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,700
I'VE READ ABOUT YOUR EXPULSION
FROM SCHOOL,

284
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,700
AND I'VE HIRED THESE ATTORNEYS
TO HELP YOU GET BACK IN.

285
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,600
SHUT UP.

286
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,300
NO WAY.
PLEASE COME IN.

287
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,500
OH, CAN I GET YOU GENTLEMEN
ANYTHING? COFFEE?

288
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,300
MAYBE SOMETHING BRITISH SOME CRUMPETS
OR A PINT OF BITTERS?

289
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,300
NO, THANK YOU.

290
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,200
SIR, YOU'RE UNUSUALLY QUIET.
ARE YOU FEELING OKAY?

291
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,500
I FEEL FINE.
DON'T EVER TOUCH ME AGAIN.

292
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,700
SO YOU TOTALLY READ
ABOUT ME?

293
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,500
YEP.

294
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,500
THAT IS SO COOL.

295
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,900
WHY DON'T YOU TELL US EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED AT SCHOOL?

296
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,100
THERE WAS THIS, UM,
LAME-ASS ASSEMBLY--

297
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,800
THE "ABSTINENCE ONLY"???

298
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,600
TWICE A SEMESTER, SOME EXPERT
IN NEVER, EVER HAVING SEX

299
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,800
TELLS US ALL ABOUT IT.

300
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,000
AFTER TWO YEARS
OF THIS, UM, BULL,

301
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,600
I DECIDED TO TAKE A STAND.

302
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,600
I SNUCK
INTO THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

303
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,400
AND PLAYED "I WANT YOUR SEX"
ER THE P.A.

304
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,300
THE CHALLENGE HERE
WILL BE CIRCUMVENTING

305
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,500
THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION
IN MORSE vs. FREDERICK,

306
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,000
WHICH LIMITS THE RIGHT TO
FREE SPEECH ON SCHOOL GROUNDS.

307
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,600
SO YOU'RE SAYING
I COULD LOSE?

308
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,000
ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY
IN LITIGATION, MS. FOSTER,

309
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
BUT...
YOU GOTTA HAVE "FAITH."

310
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,100
ANOTHER ONE
OF YOUR SONGS, I THINK.

311
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,500
OH, THAT'S RIGHT,
YEAH.

312
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,300
EXCUSE ME.

313
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,300
Hey, it's me.

314
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,300
I just got off the phone
with Rajapaksa.

315
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,600
YOU REMEMBER?
SUPER NEUROSURGEON?

316
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,100
Well, uh,
it took a lot of begging

317
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,800
and a new set of
golf clubs,

318
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,500
BUT...
HE'S AGREED TO SEE YOU.

319
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,500
OBVIOUSLY, IT'S A RISK
EITHER WAY YOU SLICE IT.

320
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,400
ACTUALLY, THERE WON'T BE
ANY SLICING INVOLVED.

321
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,700
WE BURN IT OUT OF YOU.

322
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,900
THAT'S JUST
WHAT I ALWAYS WANTED.

323
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,600
SO YOU GUYS WILL TALK
AND LET ME KNOW?

324
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,300
YEAH, WE'LL CALL YOU LATER.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, DR. RAJAPAKSA.

325
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,100
ANYTIME.

326
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,900
AWESOME.

327
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,500
OKAY, THERE IS AN O.R. FREE WEEK
AFTER NEXT WITH YOUR NAME ON IT.

328
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,900
YOU SURE THAT'S THE GUY?

329
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,100
WELL, HE'S COMPETENT, CONFIDENT,
EXPERT IN THE LATEST TECHNIQUES.

330
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,900
ELI, IF HE WERE ANY MORE QUALIFIED,
HE'D BE A FICTIONAL TV CHARACTER.

331
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,500
I'M NOT ASKING ???

332
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,500
I'M ASKING IF YOU THINK
THAT'S THE GUY.

333
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,500
I CAN'T MAKE
THAT CHOICE FOR YOU, ELI.

334
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,600
I... 
IT'S TOO BIG. I...

335
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,700
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN DO THAT.

336
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,300
YOU WANT THIS THING OUT
OR NOT

337
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,200
I WANT IT OUT.

338
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,200
I JUST--I'M NOT SURE THAT
THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME.

339
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,600
I'M HAVING A STRANGE WEEK.

340
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,200
WELL, COMING FROM YOU,
THAT'S SAYING SOMETHING

341
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,300
GEORGE MICHAEL SHOWED UP
AT MY OFFICE--

342
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,800
FOR REAL THIS TIME--

343
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,900
DON'T JOKE--THE SAME DAY
I HAPPENED TO BUMP INTO BETH,

344
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,800
AND SHE HAS KIND OF
A CONNECTION WITH HIM.

345
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,600
BETH? BETH... KELLER?

346
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,900
YEAH. HER SON SEES
A DOCTOR AT THIS HOSPITAL.

347
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,200
I WAS THINKING
OF GIVING HER A CALL.

348
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,600
A-A CALL LIKE--

349
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,600
-LIKE A DATE, YES.
-YEAH.

350
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,600
WHY NOT? I'M NEWLY SINGLE,
ABOUT TO BE ANEURYSM-FREE.

351
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,500
WELL, YEAH, BUT...

352
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,600
BUT WHAT?

353
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,600
NOTHING.

354
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,100
I JUST, YOU KNOW,
BE CAREFUL, ALL RIGHT?

355
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,000
I KNOW I'M NOT THE REASON
MY PARENTS SPLIT UP AND MY FATHER LEFT,

356
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,500
BUT WHEN YOU'RE A KID,
THAT'S HOW IT FEELS,

357
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,900
YOU KNOW,
LIKE IT'S YOUR FAULT.

358
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,200
BUT NOW YOU HAVE A CHANCE AT--
AT RECONCILING WITH YOUR FATHER.

359
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,800
IF I GIVE HIM
MY BONE MARROW.

360
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,900
WHAT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP
DO WE STAND TO HAVE

361
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,800
WITH THOSE KINDS
OF STRINGS ATTACHED?

362
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,500
I'M CURIOUS.

363
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,700
HOW DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHETHER
YOU'RE A COMPATIBLE DONOR?

364
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,700
I GOT TESTED.

365
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,700
THREE MONTHS AGO,
HE CALLED ME UP.

366
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,800
NO "HOW ARE YOU?"
NO "SORRY I WROTE YOU OFF."

367
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,500
JUST, "I'VE GOT CANC. WOULD
YOU GET YOUR BLOOD TESTED?"

368
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,700
I TAKE IT
THE TEST DETERMINED

369
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,700
THAT YOU ARE INDEED
A COMPATIBLE DONOR?

370
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,300
YES, I'M A MATCH.

371
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,300
HOPING THE FAMILY SIMILARITIES
END THERE.

372
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,500
WHY GO THROUGH THE STEPS
OF HAVING YOURSELF TESTED

373
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,300
IF YOU'RE NOT PREPARED TO GO
THROUGH WITH THE DONATION?

374
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,700
IS IT BECAUSE MAYBE YOU HAVE
AN OBLIGATION TO YOUR FATHER,

375
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,700
HOWEVER ESTRANGED
HE MAY BE?

376
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,100
I GOT TESTED BECAUSE...

377
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,900
I WANTED TO SEE
IF I WAS A MATCH.

378
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,800
I WANTED TO SEE
IF I COULD SAVE YOUR LIFE...

379
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,800
SO I COULD TELL YOU
TO GO CHOKE ON IT.

380
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,500
MY REASONS WERE JUST.
I KNEW I'D GET IN TROUBLE.

381
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,300
I JUST DIDN'T THINK
I'D BE EXPELLED.

382
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,400
DID YOU NOT KNOW THAT SCHOOL
POLICY GIVES THE PRINCIPAL

383
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,100
DISCRETION TO EXPEL ANYONE
WHOSE--WHOSE BEHAVIOR

384
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,500
"MATERIALLY INTERFERES WITH
THE LEARNING OF OTHER STUDENTS

385
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,900
OR DISRUPTS
THE OVERALL EDUCATION PROCESS"?

386
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,300
YES, BUT THAT ASSUMES

387
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,600
WHAT WAS HAPPENING
AT THE ASSEMBLY WAS LEARNING.

388
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,000
THE ABSTINENCE-ONLY LADY
TELLS US CONDOMS DON'T WORK,

389
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,200
THAT GIRLS WHO HAVE ABORTIONS
ARE MORE PRONE TO SUICIDE.

390
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,200
AND BECAUSE OF ALL
OF THOSE MISCONCEPTIONS,

391
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,200
STUDENTS IN
 ABSTINENCE-ONLY PROGRAMS

392
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,900
ARE LESS LIKELY
TO USE CONTRACEPTION.

393
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,700
OBJECTION.

394
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,600
ARE WE TO ACCEPT MISS FOSTER
AS AN EXPERT WITNESS?

395
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,700
THE PLAINTIFF'S KNOWLEDGE--
OR, I SUBMIT, LACK THEREOF--

396
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,200
GOES TO THE MERITS--
OR LACK THEREOF

397
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,500
OF THE VERY PEDAGOGY MISS FOSTER'S
PROTEST WAS TAKING ISSUE WITH.

398
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,400
MISS FOSTER,
PLEASE LIMIT YOUR ANSWERS

399
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,300
TO YOUR DIRECT EXPERIENCES.

400
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,300
MOLLY, HOW HAS THE SCHOOL'S
POLICY AFFECTED YOU?

401
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,500
FIRST, MY LAB PARTNER
GOT PREGNANT.

402
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,400
THEN, UM, A FRIEND--I DON'T
WANT TO TELL HER NAME,

403
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,500
'CAUSE HER MOM
WOULD TOTALLY KILL HER--

404
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,700
SHE GOT GONORRHEA...
IN HER THROAT.

405
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,300
I DECIDED
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING.

406
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,400
THANK YOU, MOLLY.

407
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,400
VERY DESCRIPTIVE.

408
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,000
AND THE "SOMETHING"
YOU DECIDED TO DO

409
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,100
WAS TO PLAY THE SONG

410
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,200
"I WANT YOUR SEX"
AT A SCHOOL ASSEMBLY?

411
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,600
THAT'S A VERY MATURE FORM
OF POLITICAL PROTEST.

412
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,100
THE EXECUTION OF MS. FOSTER'S
PROTEST ISN'T AT ISSUE HERE,

413
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,500
ONLY WHETHER IT'S PROTECTED UNDER
OUR COUNTRY'S MOST CHERISHED CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES.

414
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,600
-IS THAT AN OBJECTION?
-A STRENUOUS ONE, YOUR HONOR.

415
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,800
SUSTAINED.

416
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,200
THERE WAS
NO OTHER COURSE OF ACTION?

417
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,300
YOU COULDN'T HAVE
ORGANIZED A PETITION?

418
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,300
I WANTED TO EXPOSE
THE HYPOCRISY.

419
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,400
AND WHEN YOU DID, DO YOU THINK
YOU WERE BEING DISRUPTIVE?

420
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,300
I HOPE SO.

421
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,300
THK YOU.
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

422
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,200
THAT WAS INVIGORATING.

423
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,400
IT REMINDED ME
OF MY SALAD DAYS STANDING UP, 

424
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,100
MAKING A COMPELLING OBJECTION...

425
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,000
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF MY DIRECT EXAMINATION.

426
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,600
ON AN ISSUE
OF REAL SIGNIFICANCE--

427
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,100
NOT JUST FREEDOM OF SPEECH,
BUT THE APPLICATION OF THAT RIGHT

428
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,300
TO OUR NATION'S YOUNGEST,
ONES WHO ARE TRULY DISENFRANCHISED--

429
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,300
NOT HAVING THE RIGHT
TO VOTE OR...

430
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,700
SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND,
MR. STONE?

431
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,400
I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF IT WAS POSSIBLE

432
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,300
THAT YOU WERE A... FANBOY

433
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,500
OF A CERTAIN
CELEBRITY CLIENT.

434
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,900
MR. STONE, DID YOU
JUST CHARACTERIZE ME,

435
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,800
JORDAN WETHERSBY II,
SENIOR PARTNER

436
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,600
OF ONE OF THIS COUNTRY'S
MOST PRESTIGIOUS FIRMS,

437
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,400
<i>A "FANBOY"?</i>

438
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,600
OF COURSE NOT, SIR, BUT--

439
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,100
I DIDN'T THINK SO.
AND FOR THE RECORD,

440
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,100
MY MUSICAL TASTES
ARE NONE OF YOUR CONCERN.

441
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,600
IN THE NAME OF ALL
THAT'S GOOD AND HOLY, WHAT NOW?

442
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,900
-"I GOT YOU, BABE"?
-YEAH.

443
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,900
I HATE THAT SONG. I WOULD NEVER
SING IT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES,

444
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,200
EVEN HALLUCINATORY ONES.

445
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,700
JUST LIKE YOU WOULD NEVER GO OUT
WITH ONE OF OUR CO-WORKERS.

446
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,500
ELI, IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO ASK ME?

447
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,200
NO, 'CAUSE I DON'T LISTEN
TO MY VISIONS ANYMORE, SO...

448
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,700
WELL, CONSIDERING LAST WEEK,
A.K.A. BRIBING A JUDGE,

449
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,600
IT'S PROBABLY FOR THE BEST.

450
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,800
WELL, WITHOUT ADMITTING
OR DENYING ANYTHING,

451
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,500
THERE WON'T BE ANY MORE
OF THAT STUFF,

452
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,000
CAUSE I'M--
I'M HAVING IT TAKEN OUT...

453
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,200
THE ANEURYSM.

454
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,200
I THOUGHT
IT WAS TOO DANGEROUS.

455
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,600
NAH. THE ABILITY
TO SWALLOW'S OVERRATED.

456
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,600
JUST TELL ME. IS THERE SOMETHING
GOING ON WITH YOU AND MATT?

457
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,500
NO. YOU KNOW, IF YOU HADN'T
DUMPED ME REPEATEDLY, I MIGHT ADD--

458
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,700
I WOULD SAY YOU WERE JEALOUS.

459
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,100
I'M NOT JEALOUS. I'M NOT.

460
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,300
IT'S JUST BEEN
A ROUGH WEEK, OKAY?

461
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,000
YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO HAVE
ANY TIME LATER, WOULD YOU?

462
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,500
I'LL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT.

463
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,500
LOOK, I GET THE FEELING
YOU'RE ALONE RIGHT NOW.

464
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,100
SO AM I.

465
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,700
BUT I'M TRYING TO MOVE ON.

466
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,100
SO I CAN'T BE THAT SHOULDER
FOR YOU TO CRY ON.

467
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,700
I'M SORRY.
I JUST--I CAN'T.

468
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,100
THAT'S OKAY.

469
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,900
HEY, BETH?

470
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,700
IT'S ELI.

471
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,600
YEAH, WELL, I WAS THINKING ABOUT
WHAT YOU SAID THE OTHER DAY ABOUT,

472
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,800
 UH, NEEDING
TO TALK TO SOMEONE,

473
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,300
AND, UH, I KINDA DO.

474
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,400
L ACKERMAN,

475
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,700
YOU SAID THAT MOLLY WAS
EXPELLED BECAUSE HER ACTIONS

476
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,800
WERE A VIOLATION
OF SCHOOL POLICY, CORRECT?

477
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,900
STUDENTS HAVE TO LEARN
ABOUT CONSEQUENCES.

478
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,200
THAT'S WHY THE SCHOOL HAS
A STRICT ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY

479
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,500
IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES.

480
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,600
ZERO TOLERANCE? SO YOU EXPEL
EVERY KID WHO PULLS A PRANK?

481
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,500
WH THOSE PRANKS
ARE DISRUPTIVE.

482
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,900
SO LAST FALL,
WHEN THE FOOTBALL TEAM

483
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,200
KIDNAPPED THE MASCOT
FROM A RIVAL HIGH SCHOOL,

484
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,200
DID YOU EXPEL THE WHOLE TEAM?

485
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,100
I DIDN'T DEEMTHAT PRANK DISRUPTIVE
TO THE OTHER STUDENTS' EDUCATIONS.

486
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,100
WHAT ABOUT WHEN MEMBERS
 OF THE SENIOR CLASS 

487
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,300
SUPERGLUED
THE TEACHER'S LOUNGE DOOR SHUT?

488
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,700
THOSE STUDENTS WERE SUSPENDED.

489
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,600
BUT NOT EXPELLED?

490
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,800
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOUR ZERO TOLERANCE
 POLICY IS MORE LIKE A...

491
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,300
SIX TOLERANCE POLICY.

492
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,100
OBJECTION.

493
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,100
PASS THE WITNESS.

494
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,600
PRINCIPAL ACKERMAN,

495
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,800
WHY DOES YOUR SCHOOL HAVE
AN ABSTINENCE-ONLY PROGRAM?

496
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,100
BECAUSE IT'S
THE ONLY SEX EDUCATION

497
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,800
THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
WILL GIVE US MONEY FOR.

498
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,100
AND IF WORD GOT OUT

499
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,400
THAT A STUDENT PLAYED
A SEXUALLY EXPLICIT SONG

500
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,700
DURING ONE
OF YOUR ASSEMBLIES--

501
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,900
I'D LOSE THE FUNDING,

502
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,000
AND THE SCHOOL WOULD HAVE
 NO SEX ED PROGRAM.

503
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,000
IS THAT RIGHT? 

504
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,700
I DON'T KNOW.

505
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,600
WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT A GIRL
PLAYING A SONG

506
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,100
THAT PROMOTES PROMISCUOUS SEX

507
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,500
DURING A LECTURE ON ABSTINENCE
RISKS THE PROGRAM FOR EVERYONE.

508
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,200
YOUR HONOR, THE PLAINTIFF
WOULD LIKE TO CALL A REBUTTAL WITNESS--

509
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,900
GEORGIOS KYRIACOS PANAYIOTOU.

510
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,400
IT'S THE LEGAL NAME
OF THE ARTIST

511
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,800
WHO WROTE THE OFFENDING SONG,
YOUR HONOR.

512
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,500
MR. GEORGE MICHAEL.

513
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,000
FINE. COURT WILL RECESS
UNTIL TOMORROW.

514
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,800
YOU'RE A JUDGE.
THE CASE COMES BEFORE YOU.

515
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,100
DO YOU ORDER ONE HUMAN BEING
TO UNDERGO

516
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,300
A PAINFUL MEDICAL PROCEDURE
TO BENEFIT ANOTHER?

517
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,800
BOTTOM LINE--

518
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,900
IF I WERE A JURIST ON THIS,

519
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,500
I COULD FIND PRECEDENT
TO SUPPORT SAVING MY LIFE.

520
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,400
MY SON CAN BE AS ANGRY
AS HE WANTS AT ME,

521
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,000
BUT THE LAST TIME I CHECKED,
BEING A LOUSY DAD

522
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,600
DIDN'T CARRY
THE DEATH PENALTY.

523
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,200
YOU KNOW, I HAD A DAD.

524
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,200
HE LEFT MY MOTHER
WHEN I WAS... 6...

525
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,500
FOR HER BEST FRIEND.

526
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,400
I SAW HIM SUMMERS
AND EVERY OTHER CHRISTMAS.

527
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,700
I'M SORRY. AT WHAT POINT
DID MR. DOWD BECOME A WITNESS?

528
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,100
AT THE POINT
WHEN YOU LET ME FINISH.

529
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,100
MY DAD DIED THREE YEARS AGO.

530
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,100
AND IF I HAD A CHANCE
TO SAVE HIS LIFE,

531
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,300
I THINK THE FIRST THING I'D WANT
TO KNOW IS WHY I SHOULD.

532
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,700
BECAUSE REGRET'S A LOUSY THING
TO LIVE WITH.

533
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,200
WELL, THAT'S SWEET. 

534
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,800
THEY SHOULD
PUT THAT IN A POEM OR SOMETHING.

535
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,700
WE'RE ALL HERE WONDERI WHY

536
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,400
SCOTT SHOULD FEEL
ANY REGRET AT ALL.

537
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,900
YOU ARE AS MUCH A STRANGER
TO HIM AS MY FATHER WAS TO ME.

538
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,000
MORE SO.

539
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,400
WE'RE FAMILY,

540
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,700
HOWEVER ESTRANGED WE MAY BE.

541
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,000
NOTHING CHANGES THAT.

542
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
NO, YOU CHANGED IT.

543
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,100
YOU WALKED OUT THAT DOOR
TWO DECADES AGO,

544
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,400
AND YOU NEVER LOOK BACK.

545
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,800
AND SO I SHOULD DIE
FOR THAT?

546
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,600
SCOTT DIDN'T
GIVE YOU CANCER, JUDGE.

547
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,300
YOU WANT HIM TO SAVE YOU?

548
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:19,900
YES.

549
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:23,200
TELL US.
TELL US WHY HE SHOULD.

550
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,400
BECAUSE HE'S MY SON.
HE HAS AN OBLIGATION--

551
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,100
NO, HE DOESN'T.

552
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,700
YOU PISSED AWAY
ANY OBLIGATION HE HAD TO YOU.

553
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,300
NOW TELL US WHY
HE SHOULD HELP YOU NOW.

554
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,500
BECAUSE I WANT TO LIVE!

555
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,300
I WANT TO LIVE.

556
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,500
THE ONLY CHANCE I HAVE
OF THAT IS HIM.

557
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,400
BETH? TAYLOR.

558
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,400
-WE MET AT--
-OH, YOUR ENGAGEMENT PARTY,

559
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,900
OF COURSE.
IT'S SO NICE TO SEE YOU.

560
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,500
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? IS--
IS EVERYTHING OKAY? YOUR SON?

561
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,900
OH, HE'S GREAT, THANKS.

562
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,600
NO, I'M, UM,
I'M NOT HERE ON BUSINESS.

563
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,400
I'M HAVING DINNER.

564
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,400
- WITH ELI?
- YEAH.

565
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,300
THAT'S GREAT.

566
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,300
OLD FRIENDS CATCHING UP.

567
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,800
- HAVE FUN.
- THANKS.

568
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,500
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

569
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,500
'CAUSE I DESPERATELY,
DESPERATELY NEED A MARGARITA.

570
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,600
AND YOU WANT ME
TO COME WITH YOU?

571
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,400
RIGHT! GREAT.
WELL, LET ME JUST...

572
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,500
OR NOT.

573
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,100
-NO, SHE DIDN'T.
-YES. YES, SHE DID.

574
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,600
MELANIE BOSE TOTALLY
HAD THE HOTS FOR YOU.

575
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,300
SO THAT'S WHY YOU WERE
TALKING TO ME AT THAT PARTY?

576
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,400
YOU WERE PLAYING WINGWOMAN
FOR THE GIRL WITH THE HEADGEAR?

577
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,500
WHEN SHE FOUND OUT
THAT WE SLEPT TOGEER,

578
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,400
SHE NEVER TALKED TO ME
AGAIN.

579
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,000
THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU WERE A COLLEGE WHORE.

580
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,700
I KNOW.

581
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,300
-WOW.
-WHAT?

582
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,900
I JUST THINK--AND THIS IS
A GOOD WEEK, YOU KNOW?

583
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:04,100
GEORGE MICHAEL'S HERE,
MY CASE IS INTERESTING,

584
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,100
AND... AND I HAVEN'T LAUGHED
LIKE THIS IN A LONG TIME.

585
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,300
THANKS FOR GOING OUT
WITH ME TONIGHT.

586
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,700
IT'S MY PLEASURE. YOU KNOW,
ALL THAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU,

587
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,600
I'M REALLY GLAD
THAT I CAN BE HERE.

588
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,800
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW NICE IT IS
TO HEAR THAT.

589
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,000
LATELY I'VE BEEN LESS POPULAR
THAN... MELANIE BOSE.

590
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,000
WELL, YOU'RE JUST GOING
THROUGH A ROUGH TIME.

591
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,600
BUT THINK OF ALL THE PEOPLE
THAT YOU'VE HELPED--

592
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,100
OKAY, ME AND BEN FOR TWO.

593
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,100
WINNING THAT BEUTEL TRIAL
TOTALLY CHANGED OUR LIVES.

594
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,200
I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT.

595
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,300
I DO KNOW THAT.

596
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,100
I JUST--IT JUST DOESN'T
CHANGE THE FACT THAT...

597
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,200
THAT I'M ALONE.

598
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,400
I'M SO SORRY, ELI.

599
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,000
GOD.

600
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,000
I JUST BROKE
THE RULE NUMBER ONE, YOU KNOW?

601
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,800
YOU DON'T TELL A GIRL YOU'RE ON A 
DATE WITH THAT YOU'RE LONELY.

602
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:47,700
OH, GOD.

603
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,600
WHAT? ARE YOU OKAY?

604
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,300
UH, YEAH. NO.

605
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,500
NATE TOLD ME, UM,

606
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,600
HE SAID THAT HE WAS
GONNA TELL YOU TODAY.

607
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,600
TELL ME WHAT?

608
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,500
-ABOUT YOU GUYS DATING?
-YEAH.

609
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,200
OH, NO. OF COURSE
HE TOLD ME THAT.

610
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,700
OH! THANK GOD!

611
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,200
OH, MY GOD. FOR A SECOND THERE
I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU DIDN'T KNOW.

612
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,600
OH, NO. WELL, THAT WOULD
BE AWKWARD. 

613
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,200
TO LOSERS.
NATIONAL ORDER OF TOTAL LOSERS,

614
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,800
SAN FRANCISCO CHAPTER,
IN SESSION.

615
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,000
WHAT--DON'T LOOK
AT ME LIKE THAT.

616
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,900
YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY PLANS
TONIGHT EITHER,LOSER.

617
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,700
BELIEVE ME,
I COULD HAVE HAD PLANS--

618
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,800
PLENTY OF PLANS
WITH PLENTY OF LADIES.

619
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,700
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
I'M THE ONLY LOSER, THEN.

620
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:29,400
TO ME.

621
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,300
NO, YOU'RE NOT A LOSER,
TAYLOR.

622
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,800
YOU'RE SMART. YOU'RE HOT.
YOU'RE FUNNY...

623
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,700
YOU'RE HOT...

624
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,600
AND AN EXCELLENT DRINKER.

625
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,700
HE'S GETTING IT OUT.

626
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,300
WHO'S GETTING WHAT OUT?

627
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,600
- ELI.
- ANEURYSM.

628
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,100
OUT. BYE-BYE, ANEURYSM.

629
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,200
TURNS OUT THAT'S NOT
WHY HE DUMPED ME ANYWAY.

630
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,800
WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?

631
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,800
I THOUGHT HE WANTED
TO PROTECT ME.

632
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,400
I THOUGHT HE DIDN'T WANT ME
TO SEE HIM SUFFER.

633
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,200
TURNS OUT THE ANEURYSM
WAS JUST AN EXCUSE.

634
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,500
ELI DUMPED ME BECAUSE
HE JUST DIDN'T LOVE ME ENOUGH.

635
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,300
WELL, I DON'T KNOW MUCH
ABOUT ANEURYSMS,

636
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,300
BUT SOMETHING'S GOTTA BE WRONG
IF HEDUMPED YOU.

637
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,100
THAT'S SWEET.

638
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,500
WHAT YOU SAID IN COURT TODAY
ABOUT UR DAD--

639
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,900
NOW I KNOW WHY YOU HAVE TO BE
SO DAMN COCKY ALL THE TIME,

640
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,900
WHY YOU ONLY DATE
THESE VAPID BIMBOS.

641
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,600
YOU'RE SCARED THAT
YOU'RE GONNA BE ABANDONED

642
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,700
BY SOMEONE
YOU ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT.

643
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,200
SOMETIMES
IT'S JUST SO HARD...

644
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,800
TO BE THE REAL ME.

645
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,600
LOVE IS ALL THE THINGS 

646
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,400
YOU DIDN'T SAY 

647
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,600
SHE TOLD YOU.

648
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,500
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA HOW
HUMILIATING THAT WAS FOR ME?

649
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,900
-THIS ISN'T HOW I WANTED
YOU TO FIND OUT.
-THAT FINALLY 

650
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,200
AFTER MONTHS OF--
OF MISERY AND LONELINESS

651
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,900
AND--AND VISIONS,
I FINALLY ASK SOMEONE OUT,

652
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,600
AND I THINK
WE'RE MAKING A CONNECTION,

653
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,800
ONLY TO FIND OUT SHE'S
ALREADY DATING MY BROTHER.

654
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,400
I-I WAS GONNA TELL YOU YESTERDAY.

655
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,900
YEAH, I COULD TELL
FROM THE WAY YOU DIDN'T.

656
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,500
WE HAD JUST COME FROM THE DOCTOR.

657
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,600
YOU HAVE ALL OF THESE HUGE,

658
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,200
LIFE-ALTERING DECISIONS
ON YOUR PLATE.

659
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,300
I DIDN'T WANT
TO MAKE THINGS WORSE.

660
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,600
BY TELLING ME YOU WERE HAPPY?

661
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,900
I WAS TRYING TO PROTECT YOU.

662
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,200
WELL, I'M A BIG BOY, NATE.

663
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,800
YOU DATING BETH WOULDN'T
HAVE EVEN REGISTERED

664
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,100
IF YOU'D HAVE TOLD ME BEFORE
I'D MADE AN ASS OUT OF MYSELF!

665
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,800
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
SO YOU WOULD HAVE SAID,

666
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,500
"HEY, TH'S GREAT.
YOU KNOW, MY LIFE IS TANKING

667
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,100
"WORSE THAN THE LATEST
BEN STILLER MOVIE,

668
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,300
BUT I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HAPPY."

669
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,900
MAYBE I WOULD HAVE, YEAH.
WHO KNOWS?

670
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,100
I'VE BEEN
AN--AN IDIOT LATELY.

671
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,000
I PUSHED TAYLOR AWAY.

672
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,500
I PUSHED MAGGIE AWAY,
PATTI, CHEN.

673
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,900
I JUST--I JUST THOUGHT THAT
NO MATTER HOW MUCH OF AN IDIOT I WAS,

674
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,300
 I WOULDN'T PUSH
MY OWN BROTHER AWAY.

675
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,300
YOU HAVEN'T PUSHED ME AWAY.

676
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,900
YOU'VE BEEN DATING THE GIRL
I LOST MY VIRGINITY TO

677
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,300
FOR TWO MONTHS,
AND YOU HAVEN'T MENTIONED IT.

678
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,600
I SAID I WAS SORRY.

679
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,900
YOU CALL THE DOCTORS.
YOU MAKE ALL THE APPOINTMENTS.

680
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,900
BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO GO
ANYWHERE NEAR THIS DECISION,

681
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,000
'CAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID
OF HOW YOU'RE GONNA FEEL

682
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,400
IF IT DOESN'T WORK--

683
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,200
IF I END UP PARALYZED
OR WORSE.

684
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:17,000
YOU'RE A DOCTOR,
BUT YOU'RE MY BIG BROTHER, MAN.

685
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,500
AND I NEED YOU NOW
MORE THAN EVER.

686
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,300
BUT IF THIS IS
YOUR IDEA OF HELPING ME,

687
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,200
THANKS BUT NO, THANKS.

688
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,200
ELI, WAIT.

689
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,000
- JUST WAIT!
- AH!

690
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,400
COME ON, KITTY, MOVE.
YOU'RE ON MY JACKET!

691
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,700
GIVE HIM A PET.
SONNY BONO LOVES TO BE TOUCHED.

692
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,400
YOUR CAT'S NAME
IS SONNY BONO?

693
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,700
THAT'S SO WEIRD.

694
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,300
IT WAS BETWEEN THAT
AND "JASON BOURNE."

695
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,500
YOU'RE TRYING TO SNEAK
OUT OF HERE, AREN'T YOU?

696
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,400
WOW. 

697
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,900
I'M NOT SURE I'VE EVER
BEEN SNUCK OUT ON BEFORE.

698
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:00,900
NO, WAIT, I HAVE.

699
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,200
I'M NOT SNEAKING OUT.

700
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,000
???

701
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,800
?????

702
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,500
I KNOW... WITH ME.

703
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,200
PLEASE BE SEATED.

704
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,200
IT IS PROFOUNDLY
DISTURBING TO ME

705
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:24,000
THAT ONE HUMAN BEING
COULD WILLFULLY DENY ANOTHER

706
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,400
THEIR LAST HOPE FOR LIFE.

707
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,800
BUT THAT DOESN'T CHANGE
THE VERY REAL FACT

708
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,300
THAT THERE IS NO LEGAL PRECEDENT
TO SUPPORT JUDGE DOYLE'S CLAIM.

709
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,700
THE PLAINTIFF'S SUIT
FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT

710
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,600
AND SPECIFIC REMEDY
OF PERFORMANCE IS HEREBY DENIED

711
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,800
AND JUDGMENT GRANTED
TO THE DEFENDANT.

712
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,600
THANK YOU.

713
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,500
SCOTT?

714
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,100
SCOTT, I KNOW I DON'T DESERVE
WHAT I'M ASKING FOR.

715
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,200
BUT PLEASE DON'T
DO ANYTHING THAT YOU...

716
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,000
MR. MICHAEL,

717
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,500
TELL ME, WHAT INSPIRED
YOUR SONG, "I WANT YOUR SEX"?

718
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,600
A SONG, BY THE WAY,
WHICH ROSE TO NUMBER ONE

719
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,400
ON THE WORLD CHARTS--

720
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,500
A SONG THAT HELPED YOU
WIN A GRAMMY

721
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,100
FOR BEST ALBUM OF THE YEAR.

722
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,100
WELL, IT WAS INSPIRED
BY A RELATIONSHIP.

723
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,100
LIKE MOST OF MY WORK,
IT WAS AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL.

724
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,400
YOU HEARD PRINCIPAL ACKERMAN
DESCRIBE THE SONG

725
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,900
AS ENCOURAGING PROMISCUITY.

726
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,200
BUT IT'S JUST THE OPPOSITE.

727
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,500
IRONICALLY ENOUGH, I WROTE
THE SONG ABOUT ABSTINENCE,

728
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,800
AND I WAS VERY MUCH IN LOVE
WITH SOMEONE AT THE TIME.

729
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,100
SO HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT YOUR SONG BEING USED

730
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:34,600
TOPROTEST AN ABSTINENCE-ONLY
SEX EDUCATION PROGRAM?

731
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,100
WELL, I APPLAUD IT,
OBVIOUSLY.

732
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,200
WHEN I WROTE IT,

733
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,900
WE WERE IN YEAR SIX
OF THE A.I.D.S. CRISIS,

734
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,300
A CRISIS THAT RONALD REAGAN
DID NOT EVEN ADDRESS PUBLICLY

735
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,900
UNTIL THERE WERE
OVER 21,000 PEOPLE DEAD.

736
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,900
AND WHAT THE GOVERNMENT
IS DOING RIGHT NOW--

737
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,800
FUNDING FEDERAL PROGRAMS
THAT TELL CHILDREN

738
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,400
THAT CONDOMS DON'T WORK--

739
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,800
IS KILLING PEOPLE
ALL OVER AGAIN.

740
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,900
THANK YOU, MR. MICHAEL.

741
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,900
THESE ARE THE LYRICS
TO "I WANT YOUR SEX."

742
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,800
WOULD YOU PLEASE READ
THE HIGHLIGHTED PORTION?

743
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,300
"SEX IS NATURAL.
SEX IS GOOD.

744
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:18,200
NOT EVERYBODY DOES IT,
BUT EVERYBODY SHOULD."

745
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,400
DO YOU NOT THINK?

746
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,800
DO YOU DENY THAT THESE LYRICS
COULD BE UNDERSTOOD

747
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,500
TO PROMOTE SEXUAL ACTIVITY?

748
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,200
NO, TO DENY THAT
WOULD BE RIDICULOUS.

749
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,800
NOTHING FURTHER, YOUR HONOR.

750
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,300
BUT WOULD MS. ABRAMS'
INTERPRETATION OF THE LYRICS

751
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,700
BE APPROPRIATE IN THE CONTEXT

752
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,200
OF AN ABSTINENCE-ONLY
SEX EDUCATION PROGRAM?

753
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,700
WELL, I DON'T THINK
I CAN ANSWER THAT,

754
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:45,100
BECAUSE AN ABSTINENCE-ONLY
"SEX EDUCATION PROGRAM"

755
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,300
IS AN OXYMORON.

756
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,500
ABSTINENCE CAN ONLY BE A CHOICE
IF YOU HAVE ALL THE FACTS.

757
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,400
I LOVE THIS COUNTRY.

758
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,000
I LOVE THE FACT THAT
YOU GUYS HAVE A CONSTITUTION,

759
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,100
THAT YOU PRACTICE SEPARATION
OF CHURCH AND STATE.

760
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,300
BUT I DON'T THINK
I'M ALONE IN WONDERING

761
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,100
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH ALL THAT RIGHT NOW,

762
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,900
AND, UM, IN MY OPINION,

763
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:04,800
RIGHT NOW

764
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:08,100
AMERICA COULD USE
A LOT MORE PEOPLE LIKE MOLLY.

765
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,600
THE WHOLE WORLD COULD.

766
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,200
???

767
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,900
JUDGE TATE'S
DECISION IS IMMINENT.

768
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,800
MY RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE
TO SETTLE THIS NOW.

769
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,200
GET OUT WHILE YOU CAN.

770
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,200
WE DON'T WANT OUT.

771
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,500
JUDGE TATE IS NOT GOING TO

772
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,800
INSERT HERSELF INTO WHAT
IS CLEARLY A SCHOOL MATTER.

773
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,400
CONSIDER
MR. MICHAEL'S TESTIMONY.

774
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,200
JUDGE TATE CERTAINLY WILL.

775
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,400
NOT TO MENTION, ALL THE NEGATIVE
MEDIA ATTENTION HAS TO BE GETTING TO YOU.

776
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,500
JUST WAIT UNTIL GEORGE
DOES HIS PRESS CONFERENCE.

777
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,800
THAT'S A GOOD POINT, SIR.

778
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,200
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS ISN'T WORTH IT.

779
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,300
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. WE'LL
REINSTATE MOLLY, ALL RIGHT?

780
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,500
NO!
I DID THIS TO MAKE A POINT.

781
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,000
I WANT THE SCHOOL TO HAVE
A REAL SEX EDUCATION PROGRAM.

782
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,900
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS.
THERE'S NO WAY.

783
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,900
I'M SORRY, MOLLY, BUT THE SCHOOL
CAN'T HAVE A SEX ED PROGRAM

784
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,400
THAT DOESN'T RECEIVE
FEDERAL FUNDING.

785
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,200
WELL, ACTUALLY, I THINK
I KNOW HOW WE CAN RAISE

786
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,300
THAT KIND OF MONEY
IN ONE NIGHT.

787
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,200
A HERO ARISES.

788
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,900
LLY, HOW FAST
CAN YOU GET A MESSAGE OUT?

789
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,100
SIX SECONDS.

790
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,200
THERE ARE OTHER AVENUES
WE CAN PURSUE--

791
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,900
OTHER ANGLES, MORE MONEY.
EVERYONE HAS A PRICE.

792
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,400
WE COULD APPEAL TO HIS MOTHER.

793
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,700
SHE MAY SEE THINGS OUR WAY.

794
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,500
NO, I...

795
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,400
I THINK WE ALL KNOW

796
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,700
I'M GETTING EXACTLY
WHAT I DESERVE.

797
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,100
JUDGE... USE WHAT TIME
YOU HAVE LEFT.

798
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,600
REACH OUT.
MAKE CONTACT WITH YOUR SON.

799
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,700
NO, I'M... I'M DONE USING
OTHER PEOPLE FOR MY BENEFIT.

800
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,300
THEN DO IT FOR HIS.
HIS TESTIMONY WAS PROOF.

801
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,900
HE NEEDS TO LET GO
OF SOME OF THAT ANGER.

802
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,200
OTHERWISE, HE'LL END UP...

803
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,100
JUST LIKE "THE BOIL"?

804
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,400
YOU MAKE A PERSUASIVE ARGUMENT,
TAYLOR.

805
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,700
AND THANK YOU BOTH
FOR EVERYTHING.

806
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,400
NICE PICTURE, MR. DOWD.

807
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,300
WHEN WAS
THIS PICTURE TAKEN?

808
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,600
UH, THIS SUMMER.

809
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,500
AND THIS MAN WITHTHE FAMILIAL 
RESEMBLANCE WOULD BE YOUR...

810
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,600
UNCLE?

811
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,500
YOUR MUCH OLDER BROTHER?

812
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,200
BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S NO WAY
IT'S YOUR DECEASED FATHER.

813
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,400
TAYLOR...

814
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,100
???

815
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,400
BUT YOU ARE A PIG.

816
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,000
OKAY, I LIED.

817
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,200
IN COURT!

818
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,400
OH, COME ON.
I WASN'T UNDER OATH.

819
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,400
I WAS TRYING TO WIN A CASE.

820
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,800
ANYWAY, HOW RELEVANT IS IT

821
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,300
WHETHER OR NOT
MY FATHER'S ALIVE?

822
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,600
IT'S EXTREMELY RELEVANT,

823
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,200
BECAUSE THAT IS WHY
I SLEPT WITH YOU!

824
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,800
OH, COME ON. YOU DIDN'T HAVE
SUCH A BAD TIME LAST NIGHT.

825
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,900
THE QUALITY OF THE TIME
IS IRRELEVANT,

826
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,900
BECAUSE LAST NIGHT WAS
A DRUNKEN, STUPID MISTAKE.

827
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,900
ANY CHANCE WE CAN MAKE THE SAME
DRUNKEN MISTAKE AGAIN TONIGHT?

828
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,400
NOT EVEN THE SLIGHTEST.

829
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,200
OKAY.
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND--

830
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,100
I WON'T.

831
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,500
INTERESTING.

832
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,900
YOUR NEW "OFFICE."

833
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,600
WELL, SQUARE FOOTAGE-WISE,
IT'S AN IMPROVEMENT.

834
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,500
EVERYTHING READY FOR TONIGHT--
INSURANCE, SECURITY,

835
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,300
LIGHTING RENTALS?

836
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,400
YEAH, ONE OF THE PERKS

837
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,500
OF HAVING A CLIENT ROSTER
AS BIG AS THE PHONE BOOK.

838
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,100
CAN I HELP YOU
WITH SOMETHING, SIR?

839
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,800
I CAME BY TO...

840
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,000
APOLOGIES ARE DIFFICULT
FOR A MAN LIKE ME.

841
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,400
BUT GRATITUDE--

842
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,600
YOU HELPED ME, SIR.

843
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,500
WHAT I MEAN IS...

844
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,100
IT'S BEEN SOME TIME
SINCE A CASE

845
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,700
HAS MADE ME, WELL,
FEEL SOMETHING.

846
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,900
I CAN SEE WHY
YOU'VE BEEN FINDING

847
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,300
YOUR NEW CALLING SO FULFLING.

848
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,400
PLUS YOU GOT
TO MEET GEORGE MICHAEL.

849
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,900
YOU DON'T THINK
HE NOTICED, DO YOU?

850
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,300
IT WAS BARELY OBVIOUS, SIR.

851
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,000
I DISCOVERED HIS MUSIC BACK
IN THE EARLY YEARS OF THIS FIRM.

852
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,200
I WAS STUCK ON THIS HELLACIOUS
DOCUMENT PRODUCTION--

853
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,100
JUST ME
AND A ROOMFUL OF FILES

854
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,200
WORKING PAST MIDNIGHT
FOR THREE WEEKS.

855
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,700
I'D STAY SO LATE, IT WAS JUST
ME AND THE CLEANING CREW.

856
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,800
AND... ONE OF
THEM HAD A BOOM BOX,

857
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,400
AND ALL HE PLAYED WAS...

858
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,500
GEORGE MICHAEL.

859
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,800
MOST NIGHTS,
THAT WAS MUSIC WAS

860
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,700
THE ONLY THING
THAT KEPT ME GOING.

861
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:40,000
I STILL ASSOCIATE IT
WITH MY BETTER DAYS.

862
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,000
I DOUBT THOSE DAYS
REALLY WERE BETTER.

863
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,200
THEY WERE.

864
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,900
AND NOW AS I ENTER
THE WANING SIDE OF MY LIFE...

865
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,700
LOSING EVERYTHING...

866
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,700
"IS LIKE THE SUN
GOING DOWN ON ME."

867
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,700
MM, SORRY.

868
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,400
THANK YOU, ELI.

869
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,600
THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST WEEK
I'VE HAD IN A LONG TIME.

870
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,800
- HEY.
- HEY. 

871
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,200
YOU L RIGHT?

872
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,800
I MAY BE GETTING THERE.

873
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,500
LOOK, I SHOULD HAVE
TOLD YOU ABOUT BETH.

874
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,500
AND, UM, I SHOULD'VE--

875
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,200
NATE, SHUT UP.

876
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,700
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING...

877
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,300
EXCEPT THE GIRL
I LOST MY VIRGINITY TO.

878
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,200
YEAH. UM...

879
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,300
IS IT GONNA BE WEIRD
BETWEEN US?

880
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:49,400
NO.
I'M USED TO WEIRD BY NOW.

881
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,900
AND YOU'RE MY BROTHER,
AND EVEN WHEN I WANT

882
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,400
TO POKE OUT YOUR EYEBALLS...

883
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,500
I STILL LOVE YOU.

884
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
SO...
I'VE BEEN THINKIN'...

885
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,000
?????JAPAKSA. HE'S OUR GUY.

886
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,700
SURE ABOUT THAT?

887
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,300
IF YOU ARE.

888
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:12,000
YOU'RE THE DOCTOR,
AND I TRUST YOU.

889
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,500
THEN HE'S THE ONE
WE'RE PICKING.

890
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,600
AND I'M STICKING AROUND TO MAKE
SURE HE'S THE RIGHT CHOICE.

891
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,400
ARE YOU, UH, SURE
YOU WANT TO DO THIS?

892
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,800
I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE SURE
OF ANYTHING IN MY LIFE.

893
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,400
IS HE GONNA BE OKAY?

894
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,800
JORDAN?
HE'S GONNA BE ST FINE.

895
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,300
WELL, YOU DID A GOOD THING
THIS WEEK, ELI.

896
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,300
YOU'RE THE ONE DNG
THE GOOD THING, GEORGE.

897
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,400
A HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL STADIUM'S
KIND OF A STEP DOWN

898
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,100
FROM THE STAPLES CENTER, BUT IT
MEANS THE WORLD TO THESE KIDS.

899
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,600
WELL, YOU KNOW, THESE DAYS YOU
JUST HAVE TO DO WHAT YOU CAN

900
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,200
TO TRY AND MAKE
A DIFFERENCE, DON'T YOU?

901
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:42,800
YEAH.

902
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,800
CAN I GIVE YOU A BIT OF ADVICE?

903
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,300
IF ANYONE COULD.

904
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,000
I KNOW I'VE HAD
MY SHARE OF HITS,

905
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,400
BUT I'VE TAKEN
A FEW HITS, TOO.

906
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,000
AND, UH, IF THERE'S
ANYTHING I'VE LEARNED,

907
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,600
IT'S THAT NO MATTER WHAT,
YOU JUST HAVE TO KEEP GOING.

908
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,700
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

909
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,300
I THINK I DO.

910
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,900
GOOD. WELL,
THAT'S SETTLED, THEN.

911
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,100
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN--

912
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,900
MR. GEORGE MICHAEL!

913
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,000
* DA-DA-DA  DA-DA-DA *

914

915
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,900

916
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,400

917
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,300

00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,500
* STILL MISSING MY BABY *

921
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,400

00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,300
