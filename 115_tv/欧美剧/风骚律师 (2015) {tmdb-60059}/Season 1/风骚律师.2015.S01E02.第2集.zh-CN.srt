1
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,539
Nice to meet you.

2
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:42,625
I'm Bong Sang-pil, a lawyer.

3
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:44,919
Do you know me?

4
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,798
How could I know you from the get-go?

5
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,178
Lawyer Bong Sang-pil.

6
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,598
I'll take the case from now on.

7
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:58,391
Why don't you switch lawyers?

8
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,727
Are trials a business nowadays?

9
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,438
It must be tough to get by.

10
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:05,398
I was pretty famous in Seoul too.

11
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,442
Well,

12
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,986
I have a pretty solid lawyer.

13
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:16,951
Did you see that man

14
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,746
kill your mom?

15
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,873
Yes, I saw him. I saw him.

16
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,666
Hyung-man, hold onto the kid.

17
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,711
I have something to take out.

18
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,755
Let go of me.

19
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,883
Let go.

20
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,183
Detective Wu Hyung-man.

21
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,644
I'll help you get out of here.

22
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,694
Do you know who my lawyer is?

23
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,571
Of course, I do.

24
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,156
Lawyer Koh In-du.

25
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,699
The best lawyer in Ki Seong.

26
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:01,121
A former district-exclusive judge
of 25 years,

27
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,289
the epitome of legal prestige
and past glories,

28
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,291
the current corporate lawyer
of Ohju Group.

29
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,461
You're well-informed.

30
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,712
He guaranteed that

31
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,798
he'll win 100 percent.

32
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,049
One hundred percent.

33
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:17,345
But a trial is not a game of probability.

34
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,389
Don't talk to me with those fancy words.

35
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,391
This is a trade secret.

36
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,601
A lawyer who guarantees a win
always loses.

37
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:27,355
You should've filtered it out.
That old man is lying.

38
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,731
-Get up.
-Hey.

39
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,192
Is she running the business with you?

40
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,903
-You two look good together.
-I told you to get up.

41
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,446
Oh, she's our paralegal.

42
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,616
-She's good, so give us a chance.
-What are you doing?

43
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,869
Where's your pride as a lawyer?

44
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:43,413
It's not enough for lawyers
to only stand in court.

45
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,040
-Don't you think?
-Do you have

46
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,792
two jobs or something?

47
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,752
I'm closer to a problem solver.

48
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,421
The best problem solver

49
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,755
with a lawyer's license.

50
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,633
I'm here to take care of a lawyer.

51
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:56,926
Bong Sang-pil.

52
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,721
"I'll turn the tears that you shed

53
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,890
all into money."

54
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,559
He sounds like someone
who can get the job done.

55
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:09,939
But why is someone like you,
who's a complete outlaw,

56
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,400
interested in a lawyer?

57
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,948
I have my reasons.

58
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,784
No matter how I think about it,

59
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,245
I can't help but be suspicious

60
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,289
of how he suddenly crawled into Ki Seong

61
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,416
after making a name for himself in Seoul.

62
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:29,626
Ki Seong.

63
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,003
"Ki" means silk, "Seong" means castle.

64
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:34,881
A castle made out of silk. Ki Seong.

65
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,549
Don't you smell the money?

66
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,550
Silk what?

67
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:38,885
Ki Seong here,

68
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:42,055
is a paradise for lawyers.

69
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,015
For people like you and me,

70
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,393
Ki Seong is a playground.

71
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,520
What do you think Ki Seong is

72
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,439
to the lawyers who serve us?

73
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,276
It's the best gold mine.

74
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,403
You're right.

75
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:01,115
I went out to Seoul
to make a big name for myself,

76
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,617
but you're a bigger success.

77
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,453
Maybe I should've stayed here too.

78
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,081
You and I are

79
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,292
now in different leagues.

80
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,172
I have a favor to ask of you.

81
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,968
Let me join you for old times' sake, sir.

82
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:24,555
Look at him. What is he saying?

83
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,142
Chairman Ahn is no longer
a gangster like you.

84
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,270
He's a businessman,

85
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,521
an entrepreneur.

86
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,402
Well, you never know

87
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,028
how things are going to turn out.

88
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,824
Please call me

89
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:44,993
if you need any roughhousing.

90
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,955
I'll be going now, then.

91
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,672
Detective Wu is due for his first trial

92
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:00,091
for charges of murdering
Mayor Lee Young-su.

93
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:03,636
Ki Seong will also vote for a new mayor
in the upcoming by-elections

94
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,014
due to the absence of its mayor.

95
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,391
The mayoral election is more…

96
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,727
You're stealing a clearly guilty case?

97
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,103
Yes.

98
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,355
The amount of evidence is suspicious.

99
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,774
And nothing
to back up Detective Wu's innocence.

100
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:17,775
I know that too.

101
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,237
Wu Hyung-man is obviously the murderer.

102
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,905
Be honest with me.

103
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,616
What's the real reason
you're trying to take on this case?

104
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,578
-The real reason?
-Yes.

105
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,081
I'm so hungry.

106
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,416
Let's eat something.

107
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,669
Thank you.

108
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,505
I'm starving.

109
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,009
See me at my office.

110
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,179
Here, have some.

111
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,309
To be honest,
clients like Wu Hyung-man are

112
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,311
the most cost-efficient.

113
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,522
Let's say he was found innocent.

114
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,484
It'll be a matter of time
until everyone in Ki Seong finds out.

115
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:03,488
And if that happens,
richer and guiltier clients are

116
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,991
going to swarm in with bags of cash.

117
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,494
So it's for promotion?

118
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,121
What?

119
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,916
In other words,
it's a jackpot if we win the case,

120
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,627
but if we don't,
we still get the lawyer's fee.

121
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,799
You're worse than I had imagined.

122
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,637
Hey. This suit is expensive!

123
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,264
A court must be
where you scratch lottery tickets,

124
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,266
and clients must be bags of cash to you.

125
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,061
I wonder who's worse.

126
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,231
The heinous detective
who killed the mayor of Ki Seong

127
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:41,317
or the vile lawyer
who wants to get him off the hook

128
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,985
just for money?

129
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,696
What about the ex-lawyer

130
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,074
who judges the defendant on her own terms

131
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,492
before the trial is over?

132
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,582
Darn it, come on.

133
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:58,876
Hey, Jae-yi!

134
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,026
The vacancy of the mayor position

135
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,571
bothers me.

136
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,198
It's a role someone plays

137
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,159
to aid Ki Seong and you.

138
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,453
Shouldn't you choose someone

139
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,121
after you weigh all the options?

140
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,582
It's not like

141
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,834
I haven't thought about it.

142
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,797
Do you have someone in mind
as the mayoral candidate?

143
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,175
Who do you think it is?

144
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,677
Chief Prosecutor Jang Sang-ik, no?

145
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:51,846
No.

146
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:57,393
Then is it Han Tae-gyung,
the chief editor of Ki Seong Daily?

147
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,272
If it's not him either, it's--

148
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:06,027
Let's see. Is it someone
from outside of Ki Seong?

149
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,570
Nonsense.

150
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,413
Could it be

151
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:19,665
me?

152
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,462
Were you talking about me?

153
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:29,675
I'm sure you can handle it.

154
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,010
As the mayor of Ki Seong.

155
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,428
Are you serious?

156
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,766
My goodness. This is--

157
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,937
I can't believe you chose me.

158
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,565
It's a great honor!

159
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,486
You tried living as a businessman
for the last 15 years,

160
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,113
but you're still the same gangster.

161
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,866
From now on, engage in politics.

162
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,160
It suits you, Chairman Ahn.

163
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:59,580
I understand exactly what you mean.

164
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,000
I'll give it my best, Judge Cha.

165
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,502
Leave it to me.

166
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:09,507
Does Chairman Ahn have any idea

167
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,509
who actually killed Mayor Lee Young-su?

168
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,221
How would he know that,

169
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:18,099
even if all of Ki Seong is
in the palm of his hands?

170
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,894
If he did, he would've
wiped out whoever did it.

171
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,437
I mean, his friend is suffering.

172
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,939
Of course, he would.

173
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,692
You get the picture.

174
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,240
By any chance,

175
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:38,411
do you have any special requests

176
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,497
or a message for Chairman Ahn? No?

177
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,965
PLAQUE OF APPRECIATION

178
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,178
Jae-yi.

179
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:58,764
-Help me out.
-Yes, ma'am.

180
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,058
Gosh.

181
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,561
There can't be any other clothes
as uncomfortable

182
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,396
and heavy as this one.

183
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,440
There's no one else who looks so good

184
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,608
in a judge's robe.

185
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,109
You talk like everyone else.

186
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,194
This robe is too heavy for me.

187
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,579
About that lawyer.

188
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,750
So he's stealing a case?

189
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,543
Yes.

190
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,254
Sang-pil is rough around the edges,

191
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,922
but I keep thinking of him.

192
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:36,844
Also, you'll be the judge
for Wu Hyung-man's case.

193
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:39,513
Did you read the case file?

194
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,850
There is so much evidence
proving Wu Hyung-man's guilt.

195
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:44,644
Except for one.

196
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,980
It's a murder,

197
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,065
but there's no motive.

198
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:53,527
There are a lot of cases without a motive.

199
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,280
Wanton murders are common too.

200
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,324
I know that.

201
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,910
But something bothers me.

202
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,078
What is it?

203
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:03,788
I think

204
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:06,207
I'll find that out
once I meet Wu Hyung-man.

205
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:12,046
All right. You're a girl
who can't suppress your curiosity.

206
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,383
Jae-yi.

207
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,760
Your birthday was not long ago, right?

208
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,221
Should we hang out?

209
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,766
Judge Cha, I love this.

210
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,643
It's pretty. How about this one?

211
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,106
-It's pretty.
-Try it on.

212
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:36,946
How do you know my taste so well?

213
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,824
Can't you at least call me mom

214
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,243
when you're in Ki Seong, like you used to?

215
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:50,626
Mom.

216
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,215
I like it when you call me that.

217
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,383
I missed it.

218
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,387
I thought you'd go to the Supreme Court.

219
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:05,349
I honestly didn't think
you'd remain in Ki Seong.

220
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,727
This is my cradle and my grave.
I'm not leaving.

221
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:12,940
Someone from a family
of district-exclusive judges is different.

222
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,109
My father.

223
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,279
I have a long way to go
to catch up to him.

224
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,157
Judge Cha, let's go.

225
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,659
Goodness.

226
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,536
Look who's here!

227
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,832
Is that you, Jae-yi?

228
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,209
My goodness.

229
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,961
It has been so long.

230
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,713
How many years has it been?

231
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,469
Oh, hello.

232
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:42,720
Hey.

233
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:45,681
You've played a big part.

234
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:49,435
You're the biggest reason
why Yeon-hee became a prosecutor.

235
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,688
-I am?
-People who thrive

236
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:55,357
need rivals around them,

237
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:59,153
even if they are no match.

238
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,655
Ms. Nam, don't say that.

239
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,658
Judge Cha, it seems to me

240
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,828
that you favor Jae-yi more than Yeon-hee.

241
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,456
You and your jealousy.

242
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,835
Right.

243
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,755
People like me and Yeon-hee

244
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,258
really need average people like you.

245
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:22,885
So, you should be

246
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,513
proud of yourself.

247
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,270
Does anyone know what comes

248
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,897
after "however?"

249
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,694
How dare you try and ruin Yeon-hee's life?

250
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,822
Is it that tough
to give her a perfect score?

251
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:46,492
I'm blaming you if she doesn't
get into Seoul National University.

252
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,576
Ms. Nam!

253
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,412
We're in the middle of class!

254
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,123
Jae-yi, it's fine.

255
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,751
Why do you let her do this?

256
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:59,004
How dare you talk like that, you brat.

257
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,340
You little--

258
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,343
You disrespectful girl.

259
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,390
-We've never met, yet you curse at me?
-I get it.

260
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:10,724
You must be Ha Jae-yi,

261
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,519
the girl who has been competing
with Yeon-hee?

262
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,354
I'm going to call the police.

263
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:16,355
The police?

264
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:21,151
Goodness. Listen to this girl.

265
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,945
Do you know who I am?

266
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,071
Get out, please.

267
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:25,531
You.

268
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,368
I'm going to remember you.

269
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,454
Ha Jae-yi.

270
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,543
You're on my blacklist.

271
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:40,963
What are you looking at?

272
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:42,631
I'm going.

273
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,806
So you're a lawyer?

274
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,808
You've outdone yourself.

275
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,644
Dragons that rise from stale water

276
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,479
can never reach the sky.

277
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,732
Good luck.

278
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,526
Judge Cha, it's time.

279
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,488
I'll see you again.

280
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,698
Yes, ma'am.

281
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,116
Goodbye.

282
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:16,415
-Judge Cha!
-Judge Cha!

283
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,004
Young-chul.

284
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,422
Have you been well?

285
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,423
Yes.

286
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,639
This is In-ho.

287
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,182
Na-ri.

288
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:35,976
And he is

289
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,561
Yoon-su, a good student.

290
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:41,732
This is

291
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:42,942
a gift from the judge.

292
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,569
-Thank you so much.
-Goodness. Don't mention it.

293
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,616
I'll be back again.

294
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,409
-Okay.
-Goodbye.

295
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,004
Judge Cha, that was a great interview.

296
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,590
The reporter was pleased.

297
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:07,508
I'm glad.

298
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:08,926
HAND SANITIZER

299
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,302
Anyway,

300
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,554
what's going to happen
in the mayoral election?

301
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,849
There are rumors that
you have your eyes on someone.

302
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,017
Who told you that?

303
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,145
People have big mouths.

304
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,523
Whoever you point out is
guaranteed to be elected.

305
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:25,275
That's why everyone wants your attention.

306
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,276
Mr. Han.

307
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,487
Let the people figure out the election.

308
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,448
Judge Cha, you must be exhausted.

309
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:34,910
I've been looking
for a great acupressurist.

310
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:36,078
Take care.

311
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:36,996
Goodbye.

312
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,676
Foreign press made a report

313
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,679
on the ten years of support
Judge Cha Moon-sook has shown

314
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,389
for an orphanage in Ki Seong.

315
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:59,059
Judge Cha was voted
as the most respected woman,

316
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,103
and she outmatched her rival

317
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,355
on a survey for a future leader

318
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,190
and has maintained the top for years.

319
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,443
Some call her Mother Teresa of Ki Seong.

320
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,279
Three hundred twenty-three euros.

321
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,697
What’s this about?

322
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,990
-You want 453 euros?
-Yes?

323
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,452
My suit, which you smothered with ketchup.

324
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,204
-So?
-Not only was it limited-edition,

325
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,665
I waited six months to receive it.

326
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,084
It can only be washed
in the headquarters in Italy.

327
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:27,171
So that's for the laundry and shipping.
I charged you for all that.

328
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,466
It'll be taken from your wage
for the next two months.

329
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,218
As soon as my suspension is over,
I'll pay it back at once.

330
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,303
Great.

331
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,264
Also, my principles have never changed

332
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,224
whether it is for Detective Wu's trial

333
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,769
-or for anything else.
-Hey.

334
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:45,355
The Attorney-at-Law Act,
Article 1, Clause 1.

335
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,192
"The mission of an attorney-at-law
shall be to defend

336
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,569
basic human rights
and realize social justice."

337
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,655
Even lawyers like you know
the Attorney-at-Law Act.

338
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,282
Goodness.

339
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,242
Lawyers are proprietors.

340
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,245
We don't get public insurance
like doctors do,

341
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,040
but they have a law to make us

342
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,249
realize social justice.

343
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:05,834
Isn't that funny?

344
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,337
Don't you have
the slightest bit of pride as a lawyer?

345
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,713
Of course, I do.

346
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,216
Lawless Lawyer.

347
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:16,428
That's perfect. Lawless as in "empty."

348
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:20,390
No way. It doesn't mean "empty."

349
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,475
Boys.

350
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,978
It means "to fight."

351
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,773
We fight with the law
and win cases for clients,

352
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,233
Lawless Lawyer.

353
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,486
ALWAYS GO STRAIGHT

354
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,786
You are awfully optimistic.

355
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,038
Good work.

356
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,667
We did it. Yes!

357
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,544
Lawyers fight by using the law.

358
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:49,586
Remember, Ms. Ha.

359
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,423
Let's go and investigate.

360
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,342
Why? We didn't get the case.

361
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,386
We can accept the case if we investigate.

362
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,555
-Chief Tae.
-Yes, sir.

363
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,556
Get the doggy.

364
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,558
-Yes, sir.
-Doggy?

365
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,809
What's a doggy?

366
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,939
It's floating.

367
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:11,775
Doggy, go fetch.

368
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,446
It's going.

369
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,157
My gosh.

370
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,158
I've only seen this on TV.

371
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,618
You're always a step ahead.

372
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,538
About Lawyer Bong.

373
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,915
I'm dying to know about him.

374
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,251
Our boss, Bong Sang-pil.

375
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,008
May 13, 2013.

376
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,509
At 9:32 p.m.

377
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,932
That's when I got my new life,

378
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,684
thanks to Sang-pil's grace.

379
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,520
You'd be dead if it weren't for me.

380
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:51,523
Sang-pil, am I still alive?
Something just…

381
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:56,904
Sir.

382
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,406
Go home if you're going to be scared

383
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,325
-of a simple knife.
-I'm sorry, Sang-pil.

384
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,458
If I see you again from this moment on,

385
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,918
I'm going to kill you.

386
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:20,719
Bring it.

387
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,765
I only stayed in the gang

388
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,559
because Sang-pil is there.

389
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:31,730
If Sang-pil is there,

390
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:32,940
I'm going to follow him

391
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,025
even to hell.

392
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,735
I'm going to start…

393
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,322
following you two from today.

394
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,118
Gwang-su!

395
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,250
It hurts. You're bending it.

396
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,128
This is where Wu Hyung-man
supposedly murdered the mayor.

397
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,513
What are you doing?

398
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,099
Do you think it makes sense
that he was stabbed to death

399
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,934
in a freezer where people come and go?

400
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:33,959
This is a crime scene.

401
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,212
We came here knowing what this place is.

402
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,213
But who are you?

403
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,133
If you touch anything,
you'll be arrested for obstruction.

404
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,426
Why are you here?

405
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,344
Me?

406
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:46,513
I'm…

407
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:51,101
-Are you two acquainted?
-Who let you in?

408
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,602
Prosecutor Kang Yeon-hee.

409
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,313
Sorry, I believe
we weren’t properly introduced.

410
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,398
I'm

411
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,067
Lawyer Bong Sang-pil.

412
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,444
You must be bored.

413
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,988
Investigating a case
that you're not even a part of.

414
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,489
I've never failed to get a case

415
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,158
that I was determined to take.

416
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,492
Whether that was a trial

417
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:08,744
or a person.

418
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,915
Does Detective Wu
really not have an alibi?

419
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:14,875
If he did,

420
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,753
why would we go through all this trouble?

421
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:18,712
I see.

422
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:20,756
We'll be off, then.

423
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,052
You must not be able to find a case.

424
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:29,181
Should I find you a good paralegal?

425
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,019
You'll end up

426
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,521
fighting me on this trial.

427
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,106
And I don't need a paralegal.

428
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:40,609
This is a crime scene,

429
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,652
so please take good care
of the prosecutor.

430
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,530
Let's go, Ms. Ha.

431
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:51,870
-Why are we here?
-There he is.

432
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,664
You're Lawyer Koh In-du, right?

433
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:59,711
-Go talk to him.
-Oh, I'm Lawyer Bong Sang-pil.

434
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,840
I don't recognize you. What do you want?

435
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,927
Why don't you hand over
Detective Wu Hyung-man's case to me?

436
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,261
What?

437
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,641
I know that it's not very ethical,

438
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,976
but I have to take that case at all costs.

439
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:18,188
I've heard that most lawyers

440
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,940
are having it tough,

441
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,610
but seeing you go this far makes me sad.

442
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:25,904
I'm embarrassed for you.

443
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,453
Romans have their laws

444
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,539
and we have our own laws in Ki Seong.

445
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,666
Get lost when I ask nicely

446
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,418
unless you want trouble.

447
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,471
Yes, begin.

448
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:59,437
I have a long way to go
to catch up to you, Chairman Ahn.

449
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:02,357
You paid for his wife's hospital fee

450
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,152
and you hired an esteemed lawyer like me.

451
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:08,029
If you promise me

452
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,365
that you'll make him rot in prison,

453
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:15,912
I'll promise to give you a hefty sum.

454
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,542
I have one thing that I want to ask.

455
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,628
Does Wu Hyung-man

456
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,047
have something that will

457
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,799
get you in trouble?

458
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:31,845
I looked everywhere to make sure,

459
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:33,805
but found nothing.

460
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,602
By the way, I heard someone
who can confirm his alibi

461
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,228
will be in the trial.

462
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:42,981
How will you take care of that?

463
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,443
Don't worry. There's no chance.

464
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,989
He'll never vouch for Wu Hyung-man.

465
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:26,900
There must be…

466
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,405
Make sure you deliver my message.

467
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:35,784
"If you have something to say,
tell it to my face."

468
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,245
Is this your son?

469
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,040
Look at him.

470
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,834
Which school do you go to?

471
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,504
Ki Seong Elementary School?

472
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:49,923
Take your hands off the child.

473
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,174
That'll depend

474
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,426
on what you can do for me.

475
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,347
If the mother cooperates,

476
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,808
we wouldn't hurt the child.

477
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:04,479
Let's go.

478
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:11,695
Are you awake?

479
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,113
Yes.

480
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:16,533
Weren't those men scary?

481
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:20,161
I'm not scared of bad people at all.

482
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,330
I must take after you.

483
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:25,792
You're brave, Sang-pil.

484
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,295
What did you pray for, mom?

485
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:32,716
That you would

486
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,343
become a good lawyer.

487
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,407
You should go home.

488
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:00,785
Tomorrow morning is the first hearing,
so I'll go straight to the court.

489
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:03,371
You’re really working hard, aren't you?

490
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,458
How did you know that Wu Hyung-man
didn't trust his lawyer?

491
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,379
I'm the one who's curious

492
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,839
how you figured that out.

493
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:15,216
I was suspicious when I first met him,

494
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,552
then was convinced when we met again.

495
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:20,889
-Again?
-I visited him.

496
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:27,228
I knew you were a good lawyer,
but you exceed my expectations.

497
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,981
There's no reason for Wu Hyung-man
to kill Mayor Lee Young-su.

498
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,234
You don't think

499
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:36,279
that Wu Hyung-man is the murderer, right?

500
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:41,868
I'm sure you could figure that out too.

501
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,172
The trial will begin.

502
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:55,924
MAYOR LEE'S MURDER CASE, 1ST HEARING

503
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:59,219
Your Honor, we'll submit
the analysis report from the NFS

504
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:01,304
that the blood found on the knife

505
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,431
matches with Mayor Lee's blood.

506
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,767
Moreover, the defendant,

507
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,186
Wu Hyung-man's fingerprints were found
on the knife.

508
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:14,109
I'm a prosecution investigation officer,
Min Young-jae.

509
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,486
Witness, you found the evidence

510
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,071
covered with the victim's blood.

511
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:19,948
Where was it?

512
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,158
It was inside Detective Wu's cabinet.

513
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:26,371
We found Mayor Lee Young-su's bloodstains
on his pants.

514
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:28,081
Also,

515
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:30,417
the shoe prints found on the scene

516
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,502
matched Detective Wu's shoes.

517
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,174
First,

518
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:41,052
the defendant's fingerprints on the knife.

519
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:42,679
Second,

520
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:46,433
the victim's bloodstains found
on the defendant's clothes.

521
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,601
Third,

522
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,271
the defendant’s shoe prints

523
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,856
found on the murder scene.

524
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:57,235
All evidence points to Detective Wu

525
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:58,319
as the culprit.

526
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:01,740
Defense Counsel,
start your cross-examination.

527
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,244
I don't have anything.

528
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,336
Next witness, please come forward.

529
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,600
Witness, Defendant Wu Hyung-man claims

530
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,810
he was with you at the time of the murder.

531
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,938
But you testified that you never saw

532
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:37,650
Detective Wu on the day of the murder
on the police report.

533
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,027
Am I correct?

534
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,279
Yes, you are.

535
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,281
I rest my case.

536
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,867
Defense Counsel, your cross-examination.

537
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:51,790
Nothing at the moment.

538
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,753
What are you doing?

539
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,922
I'm convincing him right now.

540
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:02,300
I'm going to make him tell your alibi
before the trial ends.

541
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,177
Don't worry.

542
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,929
Can I really trust you?

543
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:08,097
Keep quiet, Attorney Koh.

544
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,355
I'm leaving.

545
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,326
Wasn't Kang Ho-il

546
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,621
a witness that you summoned?

547
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:32,997
Yes, that's right.

548
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,459
Why did you summon him
if you weren't going to ask questions?

549
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:38,920
You didn't summon

550
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,880
any other witnesses, right?

551
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:44,300
Also, your evidence list is very lacking.

552
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:46,886
Your attitude in court is half-hearted.

553
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,013
I'm gathering evidence at the moment.

554
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:52,058
I'll submit it as soon as I procure it.

555
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,113
The next hearing
will be held in three days.

556
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:11,536
Have some.

557
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,455
Once its scent latches onto your clothes,

558
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,542
it's supposed to last for 100 years.

559
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,713
It has a delightful scent.

560
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:23,506
I prefer the smell of money

561
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,467
more than the scent of tea.

562
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,012
Prosecutor Kang.

563
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,598
Who do you get your hardiness from?

564
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,557
Sorry?

565
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:34,475
Is that a compliment?

566
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,396
I was trying to boost
our rookie prosecutor's confidence today.

567
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,359
Why would
a former district-exclusive judge

568
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,153
with 25 years of experience

569
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,323
go easy on anyone?

570
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,284
You're too modest.

571
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:55,038
Please finish your conversation.

572
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,290
Thank you for the tea, Judge Cha.

573
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,254
I'll look forward to the next hearing.

574
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,256
You can do it.

575
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:15,433
Hey.

576
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,019
What are you doing?

577
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:19,937
Is the trial a joke?

578
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:24,233
I did it so that you can make
an easy ruling.

579
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,736
Head on the ground.

580
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:30,615
Okay.

581
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,338
Get up.

582
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:49,092
You should've at least
pretended to do something.

583
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:51,928
What if he switches lawyers
because of your sloppy work?

584
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:53,680
I'm sorry.

585
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:56,683
You know how I kept this court in order.

586
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:58,685
So?

587
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,729
Did you forget everything
once your life got better?

588
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:03,815
Not at all.

589
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,651
Let me keep my pride as a judge.

590
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:09,404
Don't make me look so pitiful.

591
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:12,949
I'll do my best.

592
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,159
Please believe me.

593
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,374
What is it?

594
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:23,751
Why did you come again?

595
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,878
Didn't I say I won't switch lawyers?

596
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:29,507
That was an entertaining trial.

597
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,843
How are you still saying that?

598
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,722
One defendant received
a five-year sentence

599
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,765
for stealing five bottles of sesame oil.

600
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,726
One defendant got off with probation,

601
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:43,146
a CEO of an investment company,
after making 27 people commit suicide

602
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:46,774
by manipulating
12.3 billion won worth of stocks.

603
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,818
-What's your point?
-Here's a question.

604
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:52,488
In these two trials, is the judge evil

605
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:55,199
or is the lawyer just incompetent?

606
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,492
Or--

607
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,329
did he plan on making himself
look incompetent?

608
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:01,914
A plan?

609
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:10,339
Now, look.

610
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,220
It's according to plan.

611
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:17,430
He won't notice.

612
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:20,892
I'm just going to pretend

613
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:23,060
to defend him.

614
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,604
If he gets a sentence,

615
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:28,274
he'll fall for my lies if I tell him
we can lodge an appeal

616
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:31,444
we can overturn the results.

617
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,446
You don't have to worry, Chairman Ahn.

618
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,618
What's the use of having
a perfect-win-rate lawyer

619
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:41,329
if he has no plans to win?

620
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,122
Koh In-du.

621
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,081
That bastard.

622
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,083
You look like you knew it to an extent.

623
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:47,710
What?

624
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,504
You.

625
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,672
Who are you?

626
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,966
I can postulate that
Chairman Ahn is Ahn Oh-ju

627
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,426
of Oh-ju Group.

628
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,220
This is what I'm curious about.

629
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:02,308
Why on earth would Chairman Ahn send you
to prison instead of killing you?

630
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:06,604
There must be a reason
why he's keeping you alive.

631
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,690
I'll tell you one thing.

632
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:13,569
An enemy's enemy is my ally.

633
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:19,742
Here.

634
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:21,911
Why don't you sign this

635
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,413
and hire me?

636
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:26,833
Are you part of the plan?

637
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,752
You're not doing this
for the money, are you?

638
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:32,046
What else would a lawyer work for?

639
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,715
How much research did you do
before jumping into this?

640
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,008
How much?

641
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,593
You're more suspicious.

642
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,095
What's your motive?

643
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,598
My goodness.

644
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:46,394
I don't trust you.

645
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:48,229
Get lost.

646
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:03,035
Hey. Get lost.

647
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:19,677
That's cold.

648
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:45,870
What's going on?

649
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:47,830
-Are you okay?
-Guard!

650
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,123
-Guard!
-Are you all right?

651
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,083
Detective Wu. Look at me.

652
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,544
It's written like so and so,

653
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:56,839
so there must be a meaning behind it.
Isn't that right?

654
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,090
What letter is it?

655
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,134
Don't you know? It's Chinese.

656
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,220
-You idiot.
-This is Chinese?

657
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:03,971
I guess so, but it's one letter.

658
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,973
What are you saying? This is Korean.

659
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,143
Lawyers fight by using the law.

660
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,478
Remember, Ms. Ha.

661
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,693
You don't trust your lawyer.

662
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:19,320
What?

663
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,614
Why don't you trust your top-notch lawyer?

664
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,199
Why do you care whether

665
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,742
I trust my lawyer or not?

666
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,452
Get lost.

667
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,872
You applied for retirement
as a detective, right?

668
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:30,957
To look after

669
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:32,917
your sick wife.

670
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,297
Am I right?

671
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,299
What does this mean?

672
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,427
Mu, which means "to fight."

673
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,680
-A date with mom.
-Does it mean to fight?

674
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,682
As in Lawless.

675
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:48,975
-Lawyer!
-Lawyer!

676
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,573
Jae-yi.

677
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,746
Once you became a lawyer,

678
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,957
you said you'll buy this house back.

679
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,295
The prices rocketed.
We shouldn't have sold it.

680
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,090
This area is due for redevelopment.

681
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,175
It won't go up much more.

682
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:25,928
You sold the house saying that

683
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,471
it reminds you of mom.

684
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,765
Take care of the photo studio.

685
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,108
It looks like it'll rain a lot.

686
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:43,571
It rained a lot back then too.

687
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:55,374
Jae-yi.

688
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:56,917
Where are you going?

689
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,294
To buy a harmonica.

690
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:00,171
I need to take it to school tomorrow.

691
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:02,256
I'll go and get one.

692
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:03,841
It's raining cats and dogs.

693
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:05,760
Let me go too.

694
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:09,096
The stationery store is too far away.

695
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,514
I'll go by myself.

696
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:13,351
Dad's going to come out soon
from the shower.

697
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,478
-All right.
-Give me a kiss.

698
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,607
Mom, come back soon.

699
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,233
I'll make it quick.

700
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,871
That was the last time I saw her.

701
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,876
I thought I could find her
if I became a lawyer

702
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,836
or a judicial officer of any sort.

703
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:46,634
I wonder if she's alive.

704
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,219
Miraculously alive somewhere.

705
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,890
I wish we could at least
get her remains back.

706
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,934
Something to remember her by.

707
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,540
I heard the story.

708
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:18,499
You almost died.

709
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:23,129
Do you have any guesses
who might be behind it?

710
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:26,590
Who are you hearing this from?

711
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:30,511
This is where I make my deals.

712
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,972
Also, this is a society.

713
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:35,349
He was arrested.
Don't come to see me again.

714
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,393
Aren't you going to change your lawyer?

715
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,727
I told you to get lost.

716
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:40,896
Your wife.

717
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,732
I heard she's
on the brink of death in the ICU.

718
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:46,152
You have to get out of here
as soon as possible.

719
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,653
Why you little--

720
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:48,988
You.

721
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:50,614
Who are you?

722
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,158
Who sent you here?

723
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,499
The scar on your arm.

724
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,503
Do you remember the kid who did this?

725
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,504
What?

726
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:08,466
A detective shouldn't
forget faces so easily.

727
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:11,635
Or

728
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,638
maybe you don't want to remember.

729
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,349
What should I do with the woman?

730
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:19,101
Bury her with him.

731
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,145
Let go.

732
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:30,779
The lawyer that you killed.

733
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,242
I'm her son.

734
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:40,748
You're that lawyer's son?

735
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,044
As you can see.

736
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:51,050
You said you wanted to know
why I wanted to take on the case.

737
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,303
I will

738
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:57,348
kill you after I take you out of prison.

739
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,768
I can't get my revenge on a dead body.

740
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:04,271
You lunatic.

741
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:09,151
I will

742
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,612
end your life.

743
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,533
Not here,

744
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:17,618
but outside.

745
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,496
You.

746
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,373
Guard. Guard--

747
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,643
HA FAMILY'S PHOTO STUDIO

748
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,311
Stay there.

749
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,188
I'll get an umbrella.

750
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:49,650
Open the door.

751
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,090
Sang-pil.

752
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:14,925
Did you make a decision?

753
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:17,803
I can't die in here,
so let's talk outside.

754
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,390
Take my case.

755
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:24,935
Good choice.

756
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:28,105
I'm going to do things my way from now on.

757
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:30,983
Can you get me out of here for sure?

758
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:34,028
Don't worry.

759
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,405
I'll use everything I have to get you out.

760
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:41,076
You realize that
I'm a detective outside, right?

761
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,122
You're right.

762
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:48,334
You'd better keep your promise.

763
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:51,086
I have to leave this place.

764
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:53,589
The fee

765
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:55,174
will be paid with your life.

766
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:26,330
LAWLESS LAW FIRM

767
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:50,688
Mom.

768
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:55,150
How are you?

769
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:07,121
Don't be afraid.

770
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:10,833
Be brave.

771
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:13,293
Live bravely.

772
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:15,254
Do you understand?

773
00:45:57,754 --> 00:45:59,339
Is this your office?

774
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:07,014
And where Jin-ae died?

775
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,401
Wu Hyung-man's trial.

776
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:22,571
I just took on the case.

777
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:24,573
I see.

778
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,535
Are you okay with only Chief Tae?

779
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,703
I'll get you more men--

780
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:32,206
No, it's okay.

781
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,004
Has it finally begun?

782
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:41,423
No.

783
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,595
It began 18 years ago.

784
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:50,474
I'm going to…

785
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:57,022
I'm going to punish them
with my own hands.

786
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,651
-Sang-pil.
-All those men who killed my mom.

787
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:03,946
All of them.

788
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:08,492
All of them, with no exception.

789
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:12,037
I'm going to take the ones in prison out.

790
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:16,250
I'm going to put
the ones outside in prison.

791
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,210
With my hands.

792
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:21,547
With my hands!

793
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:28,136
I'm going to show them living hell.

794
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:35,060
Why are you here at this hour?

795
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:38,313
Wu Hyung-man switched lawyers.

796
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:40,357
I think Bong Sang-pil will be in court

797
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,984
for the next hearing.

798
00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:45,696
People who are destined for failure

799
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:48,782
plot their own demise.

800
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:54,538
I can't let the rat in the corner

801
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:58,208
bite the cat.

802
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:00,919
Am I wrong?

803
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:05,382
Hey.

804
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,342
Gwan-dong.

805
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,513
I need you to do a job with me.

806
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:16,810
I got Wu Hyung-man's case.
Come to the court.

807
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:19,438
He got the case? How--

808
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:23,525
Lady, let me ask you something.

809
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:24,985
What?

810
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:26,403
LAWYER BONG SANG-PIL

811
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:28,447
You're Bong Sang-pil's girlfriend, right?

812
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,616
-What?
-Why would you

813
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:33,076
date a guy like him
and get yourself into this mess?

814
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:35,120
What?

815
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:37,915
Who are you? Let me go.

816
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:40,542
Let go! Who are you?

817
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:42,669
I'm telling you to let me go.

818
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:43,754
Let go.

819
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:45,464
Let go.

820
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:49,051
LAWYER BONG SANG-PIL

821
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:50,636
I'm nervous being at court.

822
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:52,220
He's here.

823
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:55,307
-Hello, Lawyer Bong!
-Hello, Lawyer Bong!

824
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:57,100
I don't like this scenery.

825
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:58,477
I'm sorry, sir.

826
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,979
They wanted to see
your first trial in Ki Seong.

827
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:05,817
By the way, where's Ms. Ha?

828
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,569
It's 20 minutes before the trial.

829
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:09,655
-Audience, please enter.
-My gosh.

830
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:11,114
-Where is she?
-Look at that.

831
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,741
-Fancy.
-It's so fancy.

832
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:21,375
When are you coming?
The trial will begin now.

833
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,751
Sang-pil.

834
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:28,757
You can't hear me?

835
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:31,551
Turn off the music.

836
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,055
Hear me now?

837
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:38,433
Your voice sounds familiar.

838
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:39,977
After losing my accountant,

839
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:43,021
my business was badly damaged.

840
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,856
Why did you come to Ki Seong?

841
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:48,443
And why do you have Ms. Ha's phone?

842
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:49,444
I wonder.

843
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,614
Why is your girl's phone in my hand?

844
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:56,118
Speak, lady.

845
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:57,786
Tell him you're alive.

846
00:49:57,869 --> 00:50:00,831
You disgusting thugs.

847
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:02,499
I'm going to--

848
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:05,127
I'm going to charge you for danger pay.

849
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,211
You better prepare it.

850
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:09,464
That's my paralegal, all right.

851
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:12,050
Come here right away.

852
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:14,386
Your girl is going to lose an organ

853
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:17,431
for every 10 minutes that you're late.

854
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,017
Do as you wish.

855
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:30,360
-What?
-She's not my girl.

856
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:32,154
She's just my paralegal.

857
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:33,864
You chose the wrong hostage.

858
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:37,284
The trial's about to begin.
I'm hanging up.

859
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:41,204
Hey.

860
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:43,999
-Aren't you Sang-pil's girl?
-What?

861
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:46,752
Why would I be his girl?
You stupid gangsters.

862
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:50,130
You should've done some research
before you kidnapped me.

863
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:53,341
So,

864
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:55,343
he won't rescue me?

865
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:56,762
He told me to do whatever.

866
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:59,347
Darn it, Sang-pil, you traitor.

867
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:04,269
LAWYER BONG

868
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:08,356
You decided to be a man and call back.

869
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,816
I changed my mind.

870
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:12,152
I have to go to court,

871
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:13,987
but you ruined my mood.

872
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:16,031
Where are you?

873
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:20,702
What's your plan?

874
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:24,748
Don't let them start the trial

875
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:26,917
before I get Ms. Ha back, okay?

876
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:30,420
We'll make sure to do that.

877
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:54,569
Hey.

878
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:58,865
Sang-pil is heading there?

879
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,242
Yes.

880
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:02,536
Tell him to choose one.

881
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:04,079
Either give up the trial

882
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:05,956
or give up breathing.

883
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:07,833
I'll make him give up both.

884
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:10,836
Gwan-dong, it sounds like you're bitter.

885
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:12,420
Right?

886
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:13,880
I have your back.

887
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,632
Do what you want.

888
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:28,520
Everyone knows
if you scratch an imported car,

889
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:30,814
you're in deep trouble.

890
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:33,191
But some people lack the common sense

891
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:35,485
that you shouldn't hit or kidnap a person.

892
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:38,697
You look better than the last time we met.

893
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:42,117
Who’s your stylist? You look super fancy.

894
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,035
Is your stylist your mother?

895
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:45,579
What did you say?

896
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:50,417
No lawyer would come all this way
to teach you a lesson.

897
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:56,047
She doesn't look so bad yet.

898
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,050
Did you forfeit the trial?

899
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:01,303
What else can I do when my employee

900
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:03,305
and precious debtor is in trouble?

901
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:05,307
Also…

902
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,271
I didn't forfeit the trial.

903
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:16,902
Judge Cha Moon-sook is entering.

904
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:17,819
All rise!

905
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:25,619
Please take your seats.

906
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:33,543
I heard that you swapped your lawyer.

907
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:35,378
That's right.

908
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:38,298
Are you Lawyer Bong Sang-pil?

909
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:40,133
That's not him.

910
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,968
Lawyer Bong Sang-pil

911
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:44,137
left the court before the trial.

912
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,932
Did the prosecution see him?
Where did he go?

913
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:49,851
He must have been nervous about the trial.

914
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:53,813
Where did Lawyer Bong Sang-pil go?

915
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:56,441
Well, about that--

916
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:59,236
Explain to us why you're sitting there.

917
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:06,368
I'm his associate lawyer.

918
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:13,541
I was caught off guard last time.

919
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:16,169
This time, I'm thoroughly prepared.

920
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:19,339
You'd better prepare yourself today.

921
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:23,760
Well, Mike Tyson once said this.

922
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,805
"Everyone has a plausible plan.

923
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:30,558
Until their heads are
planted on the ground

924
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:32,018
after they take my punch."

925
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:38,775
Stop!

926
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:40,360
An associate lawyer?

927
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:44,614
Isn't Lawyer Bong Sang-pil
defending this case on his own?

928
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,617
Well, about that,

929
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:50,120
-a little while ago, the lawyer--
-Defendant.

930
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:53,123
-Yes, ma'am.
-Is what he just said true?

931
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:57,168
I mean, that is--

932
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:59,963
The Attorney-at-Law Act,
Article 112, Clause three.

933
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:03,174
Do you know that impersonating
a lawyer is a serious crime?

934
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:04,759
Yes, I know.

935
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:12,976
This is the body of a gangster,

936
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:14,769
not a lawyer.

937
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:17,022
Are you really a lawyer?

938
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:19,858
Do we have an unidentified man

939
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:21,818
impersonating a lawyer?

940
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:24,988
Guards, arrest him immediately.

941
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:26,156
Defendant.

942
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:28,616
-Yes.
-What are you doing?

943
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,869
Do you want this to be your last hearing?

944
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:32,328
No, Your Honor.

945
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,622
Since the defendant is absent,

946
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:36,041
-today's hearing--
-Come here!

947
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:37,334
Where is he?

948
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,627
Where is that con artist?

949
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:42,422
-Me?
-Who else other than you?

950
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:45,341
Cough up the money, you con artist.

951
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,594
Judge, I will

952
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:49,471
kill him and go to jail.

953
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:51,890
You con artist.

954
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:05,403
You.

955
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:09,491
Silence.

956
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:21,419
Can't you hear me?

957
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,213
-You jerk!
-Wait!

958
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:27,717
You thug!

959
00:56:28,384 --> 00:56:29,886
Order, please!

960
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:47,445
Are you okay?

961
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:49,447
Is this real? Are you Sang-pil?

962
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:50,532
Yes, I'm a lawyer.

963
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:55,787
Sang-pil!

964
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:00,500
Damn it.

965
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:04,462
Let's go.

966
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:09,926
How could you--

967
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:11,970
I'm coming soon. Hold out a little longer.

968
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:16,391
What are you doing?

969
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:18,977
Please be silent in my court.

970
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:21,271
If you don't be quiet,
I'll detain all of you.

971
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:22,522
Listen!

972
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:29,404
What are you doing? Move.

973
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:31,948
-It's going to be over soon.
-Are you a gangster?

974
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:33,825
Take a seat, Judge Cha.

975
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:37,579
Come here. Come!

976
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:44,169
How dare you? You jerk!

977
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:04,439
No need to thank me.

978
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:08,276
It's only because work would be
troublesome without you.

979
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:12,655
I was kidnapped because of you.
Of course, you had to come.

980
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,240
You don't need to feel sorry.

981
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,493
Well, you saved me after all.

982
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:18,536
And even if you hadn't come,

983
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,538
do you think I would've let them harm me?

984
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,592
The defendant was also stabbed.

985
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:34,761
She was just trying to defend herself.

986
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:36,387
Security. Take her away.

987
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:39,265
It's not because I’m a woman.

988
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:42,101
You made a wrong ruling.

989
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:02,914
She looks like she was fired.

990
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:04,749
A partnership is out of the question.

991
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:08,419
Should I hire her as a paralegal?

992
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:11,673
Collect money
from all delinquent debtors today.

993
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:13,633
Right now?

994
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:14,801
Yes.

995
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:16,010
Especially here.

996
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:17,929
Ha Family's Photo Studio.

997
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:19,472
Ha Family's Photo Studio?

998
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:20,598
I understand.

999
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:27,355
That brat.

1000
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:28,690
I'm going to kill you.

1001
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:35,113
Run away! Quickly!

1002
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:36,948
Come back here! Let go!

1003
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:40,326
-My leg!
-Go, quickly!

1004
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:46,124
What happened to my mother

1005
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:49,877
also happened to your mother.

1006
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:54,007
What are you looking at?

1007
00:59:57,719 --> 00:59:58,553
This fight

1008
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:01,264
will be our fight from now on, Jae-yi.

1009
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:04,100
A fight?

1010
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:05,435
The trial, you mean?

1011
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:09,647
Yes.

1012
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:12,233
Step on it before we're even more late.

1013
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:21,951
Hey, you thugs!

1014
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:23,369
What on earth are you doing

1015
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:26,372
at the sacred court?

1016
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:53,274
Where are you?

1017
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:56,235
We found it.

1018
01:00:57,945 --> 01:01:00,073
What should we do
with the lawyer and her son?

1019
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:02,742
Kill them both.

1020
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:08,122
I don't trust the living.

1021
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:39,529
Who are you?

1022
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:44,450
I'm Lawyer Bong Sang-pil.

1023
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:50,665
The trial starts now.

1024
01:01:54,752 --> 01:01:56,504
Judge Cha Moon-sook.

1025
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:20,778
Be careful of those
who exploit your trust.

1026
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:22,238
I trust you.

1027
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:23,197
Jae-yi.

1028
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:27,618
In my opinion, lawyers are people
who fight against prejudices.

1029
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:30,955
Ahn Oh-ju is involved
in Mayor Lee Young-su's death, right?

1030
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:32,999
Have you heard of the Golden City?

1031
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:35,960
Doesn't it stink of crime already?

1032
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,423
Oh, gosh. I'm sorry.

1033
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:43,050
Where do I begin?

1034
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:44,510
Jae-yi.

1035
01:02:45,052 --> 01:02:49,557
