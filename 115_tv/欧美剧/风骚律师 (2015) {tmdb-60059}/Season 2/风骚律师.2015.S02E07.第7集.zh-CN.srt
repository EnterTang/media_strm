1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,300
Come on, frank. Old movie,
popcorn--it'll be fun.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,400
ElI, I can't help but notice, we--we seem to
be spending a lot of time together lately and--

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,700
are you breaking up with me?

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,100
- Look, if you're lonely...
- I'm not lonely.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,700
I have this patient--
fun, great personality...

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,800
hey, if I wanted to spend
three hours having a long,

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,900
uncomfortable conversation
full of awkward pauses,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,700
I'd go out for a meal with my mother.

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,800
What's she seeing you for anyway?

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,200
- Acupuncturist/client privilege, dude.
- Come on.

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,300
She's trying to quit smoking. Did
I mention she's almost a nonsmoker?

12
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,100
I'm not interested.

13
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,100
Maybe just give her a call.

14
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,500
patti? 

15
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,800
Eli, she's innocent.

16
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,500
Who's innocent, patti?

17
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,500
- Down in front!
- What?

18
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,400
Yeah, sure thing. I'll tell him.

19
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,200
- The next joint?
- Yeah, sure.

20
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,000
patti, where are you? I've been trying 
you all morning.

21
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,500
Don't worry. Everything's fine.

22
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,500
I just--I-I wanted
to ask you something.

23
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,100
I see you're not at your desk.

24
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,900
This is gonna sound peculiar, but I was
wondering if maybe you needed my help.

25
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,400
Hold on. Slow down. What? Come on.

26
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,100
- you're not making any sense.
- Patti. Patti!

27
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,100
well, I'm leaving now.
I'll see you there.

28
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,300
- Is everything all right?
- I'm taking a sick day.

29
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,300
Are you okay? Who were you talking to?

30
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,100
Angela's roommate.

31
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,300
- Angela was arrested.
- Angela was arrested?

32
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,400
- Another D.U.I.? 
- Wh-- another D.U.I.?

33
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,900
Repeat what someone says one more time...

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
two weeks ago, angela
got pinched for a D.U.I.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,200
I got it kicked, but apparently...

36
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,300
she got arrested again?

37
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,700
The cops came to her apartment.

38
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,400
They handcuffed her and
dragged her out like a criminal.

39
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,400
Now please, I have got
to get to bryant street.

40
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,500
We're coming with you.

41
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,100
Uh, you asked for my help, so...

42
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,900
no, I didn'T.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,700
Well, obviously you need some help, 

44
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,500
and you know two great attorneys 
who would love to help you,

45
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,000
so we're coming with you, okay? Come on.

46
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,200
Huevos rancheros?

47
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,600
I see your pregnancy cvings have
taken a dramatic turn for the spicy.

48
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,700
Actually, you're the one who was supposed 
to be eating them 

49
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,800
at your breakfast meeting with jorge navarro.

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,900
Was that this morning?

51
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,000
Well, now it's tomorrow morning.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,600
Just make sure and mention how painful
it was when your crown fell out.

53
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,600
It's not like you to
forget a meeting, dad.

54
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,700
These days I'm burning
my candle at both ends.

55
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,600
Between a full day of depositions
and financial meetings,

56
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,700
I must put in an appearance at
the osterhagen benefit luncheon.

57
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,100
Could I interest you in a
half-baked speech followed by squab?

58
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,600
couldn't interest ellen in that one, huh?

59
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,600
No, not this time.

60
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,000
Well, you know how I love a good squab,

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,700
but matt and I are going to
find out what's going on in here.

62
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,400
Yes, the sonogram.

63
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,800
Are you gonna find out the sex?

64
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,100
It's a little too early to find out
whether you could buy it a baseball mitt.

65
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,800
It's never too early for that.

66
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,400
case number 0-8-1-2-1-9-7-2,
people V. Scott.

67
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,700
What's he doing here?

68
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,500
Helping you, angie. We both are.

69
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,000
Keith bennett and eli stone of wethersby, stone
& associates for the defendant, your honor.

70
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,400
Waive reading, plead not guilty.

71
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,600
Actually, keith, I think u're gonna
want to hear the charges on this.

72
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,500
Defendant is chargedwith three counts each of
felony drug theft and narcotics trafficking.

73
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,900
The defendant stole
fentanyl, 

74
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,000
a highly addictive and powerful synthetic 
opiate from a teaching hospital 

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,500
where she is a medical student.

76
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,100
Our plea still tands. Not guilty on all 
charges. Move to release on recognizance.

77
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,100
She's charged with six major drug felonies, 

78
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,800
for which she faces very significant 
prison time.

79
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,600
She's not going anywhere.
I'll vouch for that.

80
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,900
Like you vouched last time?

81
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,800
All right, I'm setting bail
at $500,000 cash or bond.

82
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,500
I'll post the bond myself.

83
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,000
very sporting of you, mr. Stone.

84
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,700
She's innocent, judge.

85
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,700
Save it for your closing.

89
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,300
????I am not a drug trafficker.

90
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,000
We believe you, angela.

91
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,800
Mom?

92
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,800
Yes, of course, sweetheart.

93
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,500
Why do they think you stole the drugs?

94
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,100
I don't know. It's all lies.

95
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,100
So you've never been in the drug
supply room at your hospital?

96
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,200
Of course I have. I work at a hospital.

97
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,500
It's what I do every day,
at least a dozen times a day.

98
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,400
Do you remember anything about the
night they say you stole the fentanyl?

99
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:32,200
I checked out 20 milligram-prednisone
tablets for S.Henderson's arthritis,

100
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,600
100 micrograms of levothyroxine
for mr. Flynn's thyroid condition,

101
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,200
and 600 milligrams of l-dopa
for mr. Zachry's parkinson'S.

102
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,600
Those are some pretty specific memories 
for something you do every day, 

103
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,300
at least a dozen times a day.

104
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,400
Gee, keith, maybe a good memory's
one of the reasons I'm a student

105
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,600
at one of the top medical
schools in the country.

106
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,200
It's true. She has a
memory like an elephant.

107
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,100
So the school suspended and investigated
you, the police arrested you,

108
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,100
the D.A.'S prosecuting you-- 
all for no reason?

109
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,200
I don't know what their reason is.

110
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,500
I just know I'm not guilty.

111
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,600
It's not your job to figure
out what their case here is.

112
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,300
It's ours.

113
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,800
taylor, hi. Congratulations.

114
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,200
Thanks, dr. Lenz.

115
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,500
And you must be...

116
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,900
who are you?

117
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,100
- A friend.
- Uh, boyfriend.

118
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,600
Our relationship's sort of undefined.

119
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,700
Uh, basically I'm the guy not important
enough to leave on the intake form.

120
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,900
Well, he's the biological father.

121
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,700
- That makes you plenty important.
- Thank you.

122
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,700
ready to see your baby?

123
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,000
Should I turn away if you
guys want to look down...

124
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,800
right.

125
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,700
oh, my god.

126
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,300
See there? That's your baby's heart.

127
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,800
That's unbelievable.

128
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,700
Everything looks perfect.

129
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,900
you two done good.

130
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,000
- perfect timing.
- You wanted to see me, paul?

131
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,900
Maggie dekker, meet ashley cardiff.

132
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,200
Nice to meet you.

133
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,300
As you know, cardiff refineries is
one of our firm's biggest clients.

134
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,000
That's my father and grandfather.

135
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,100
They're the ones who live to crack open the
earth like a pita and steal all its candy.

136
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,600
But ashley doesn't have
the same family sweet tooth,

137
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,300
since she has asked us to set up a
charitable trust for arctic wildlife

138
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,800
damaged by her family's pipeline.

139
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,200
Well, not every woman likes to eat
moose burgers and shoot polar bears.

140
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,000
No. Good for you.

141
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,300
- Paul, could I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah.

142
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,800
Excuse us.

143
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,300
When mr. Posner and ms.Klein
brought me to this firm

144
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,300
and put me in charge of
the pro bono department,

145
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,900
they agreed that I could
prioritize my own cases.

146
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,600
Is it possible we're sleeping together, 
ms.Dekker, and I don't know it?

147
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,200
No.

148
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,500
So why would you think I care very
much about what you like or dislike?

149
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,500
I am the assigning partner.

150
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,400
You will do this, and yowill
do this to the best of your...

151
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,600
well, whatever ability
mr. Posner sees in you.

152
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,300
This job sucks.

153
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,100
Cardiff refineries treats the
environment like a port-a-potty,

154
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,400
and now i have to help daughter
warbucks buy her way to a conscience.

155
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,500
i mean, what is it about
the rich that makes them think

156
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,000
that they can just buy their way
into being good people?

157
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,200
probably the tons of money.

158
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,400
you notice whenever the press
writes about her, 

159
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,700
they call her the "heiress" ashley cardiff?

160
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,100
that's what she does.
that's--that's her job.

161
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,600
heiress.

162
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,000
you didn't hear a word of that just now.

163
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,100
taylor and i went to the doctor today.

164
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,200
is the baby all right?

165
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,800
yeah. Yeah. Seeing the little heart go...

166
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,400
it's really in there.

167
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,900
that's a good day, matt.

168
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,000
yeah, it should have been.
it was... Really strange.

169
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,400
whatever the hell taylor and i are,

170
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,700
it would have been nice to know before 
going in for something like that.

171
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,500
it couldn't have been
more uncomfortable.

172
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,100
maybe it would help
if you... Defined things.

173
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,600
i asked her to marry me.
don't worry. She said no.

174
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,400
i was trying to do the right thing.

175
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,600
she doesn't need you to do
the right thing, spike.

176
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,600
she just wants you to love her.

177
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,600
that's all any woman wants, really.

178
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,200
that hasn't been????

179
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,400
but i do have those feelings for her.

180
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,600
and in the sense that you've
said the words "i love you"?

181
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,400
not in so many words...particularly,
those specific words.

182
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,200
matt, she's having your baby.

183
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,600
don't you think that she might want 
to hear the actual three little words?

184
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,900
yeah, i know, it's just, those actual 
three little words are... Big.

185
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,400
you're gonna be a father, matt.
it's all big from here on out.

186
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,000
all right, let's get back to work.

187
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,900
i've told you and eli everything i know.

188
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,400
i'll tell you when you've told
us everything you know.

189
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,500
so did you tell my mom?

190
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,500
about how you think i was doing cocaine 
the night i was pulled over?

191
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,600
all right, for the record,

192
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,500
it wasn't me who suspected you of 
doing coke. it was in your blood work.

193
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,900
and, no, i didn't tell patti.
attorney client.

194
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,300
plus, what she knows about
you... Isn't my business.

195
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,200
did you tell eli?

196
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,900
what he knows about you is 
very much my business.

197
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,500
did you also tell him that the test 
results returned a false positive?

198
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,900
i told him that's what you
told me. he even believed it.

199
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,600
it's the truth!

200
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,100
yeah, well, your denials
carried a lot more weight

201
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,100
before you got popped
for possession with intent.

202
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,500
so you do think i'm guilty.

203
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,100
i worked ten plus years
in the public defender's office.

204
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,400
most of my clients
were guilty as charged,

205
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,400
but not one of 'em ever got
anything less than my "a" game.

206
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,000
well, aren't you a big man?

207
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,400
- i didn't say i was--
- i'm not finished.

208
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,800
i want you to believe in me,
not some principle.

209
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,600
and if you can't do that,
well, then you can go to hell.

210
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,200
i saw you yawn. there should be no yawning
on my daughter's case.

211
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,500
ah, don't worry. i yawned because i'm tired,
not because i'm bored.

212
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,800
how are things looking?

213
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,700
good.

214
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,700
shaky.

215
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,200
the d.a.--um, she can make this case.

216
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,600
i-i've seen people go to jail
on a lot weaker evidence.

217
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,400
but their case has holes,
and i'll make them wider.

218
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,500
okay.

219
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,400
how are you holding up?

220
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,500
i went to church...
this morning to pray for angela.

221
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
my girl is my reason for being.

222
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:49,200
everything in my life has been
for her life, and, um...

223
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:56,400
now they're saying she's a junkie, 
and, um...thief.

224
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,800
- i want to believe her.
- we're gonna get through this, patti.

225
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,500
oh, i'm not crying because of that.

226
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
i got the message.

227
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
- what message were you talking about?
- from you.

228
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,600
the voice mail asking me if i needed help

229
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,800
before i found out that angela was arrested. 
you knew i needed help before i did.

230
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,400
did you get a message, too?

231
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:35,300
like--like with the earthquake 
or when you saved jordan?

232
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,100
yeah.

233
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,200
- and it told you to--to help angela?
- not just that, patti, it...

234
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:51,000
told me...that angela is innocent.

235
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,400
- she is?
- she is.

236
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,500
well, then you get to work
and do as you're told.

237
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,400
- yes, ma'am.
- oh. 

238
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,100
???

239
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,800
are stored in automated pyxis machines, 
which require a fingerprint i.d. To open.

240
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,500
access to the machine and each individual 
drug are automatically recorded in a log.

241
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:26,300
i imagine that the drug the defendant 
is charged with stealing--fentanyl--

242
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,300
is accessed routinely by
many doctors in your hospital.

243
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:35,600
yes, but miss scott was the only one 
to withdraw fentanyl without a m.a.r.--

244
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,300
a medical administration record.

245
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,800
which means what?

246
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,300
she wasn't accessing the drug
for a specific patient.

247
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,300
is that the only reason you had
to suspend miss scott?

248
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,500
angela's behavior had 
become increasingly erratic,

249
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,100
her grades were in decline,

250
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,900
and she was persistently
stressed and moody.

251
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,300
these are classic signs
of drug dependency.

252
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,700
so angela scott is the only person in your
ntire hospital who is stressed and moody?

253
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,400
it sounds like disneyland is in danger 
of losing its distinction of being

254
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,800
"the happiest place on earth."

255
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,100
object to the sarcasm.

256
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,100
i'm sorry, your honor.
i was going for ridicule.

257
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,100
is it your testimony that
angela scott was the only doctor

258
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,400
seen removing fentanyl from the pyxis machine 
on the three nights in question?

259
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,400
in point of fact, no one actually witnessed
the fentanyl being removed.

260
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,100
sounds like an ironclad case.

261
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,500
that was sarcasm, your honor.

262
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,300
your next witness, miss jarrells.

263
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,600
the people call s.f.p.d. Officer 
jerome sawyer--

264
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,300
objection.

265
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,800
officer sawyer recently arrested
the defendant

266
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,000
on suspicion of driving
under the influence of alcohol.

267
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,800
- objection. Move to strike.
- move for a mistrial.

268
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,600
evidence of prior bad acts is
not even remotely admissible.

269
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,400
it is, to establish motive.

270
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,500
we believe that the defendant
traded the fentanyl for cocaine, 

271
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,900
which was indicated
in the d.u.i. Blood test.

272
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,900
she's saying this crap in front
of the jury, your honor.

273
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,000
move for a mistrial.

274
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,200
i can't do that, mr. Bennett,
because the a.d.a. Is right on this. 

275
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,600
The prior charge and the blood test go 
to motive and are therefore admissible.

276
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,600
are you doing cocaine?

277
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,300
the night of my d.u.i.,

278
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:24,400
there was a party after exams, 
and someone had coke.

279
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,900
i had never tried it before. i know.
i know it was a mistake.

280
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,300
and getting behind the wheel of a car
--that was another mistake.

281
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,800
i am so sorry, eli.

282
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
i know how disappointing this all is,

283
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
but it--it was just one time,
one night. It's not who i am,

284
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,800
and it doesn't mean i stole those drugs, 
which i didn't.

285
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,700
please, don't give up on me. please?

286
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,000
i-i know you didn't do this,

287
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,100
but i also know that we're gonna 
lose this trial

288
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,600
unless you stop fighting us 
and start fighting back.

289
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,900
sean binder. that--that's 
who gave me the coke.

290
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,900
would he have had access
to the fentanyl?

291
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,600
yes, definitely.

292
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,800
i'll bring h in for a chat.

293
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,300
you don't like me, do you?

294
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,400
what? no. No.

295
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:23,900
well, i mean, we--we just met, 
but no, you seem... Lovely.

296
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,400
dad said he liked this firm 
because there were good lawyers

297
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,400
who were good liars.

298
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,600
i'm used to people not liking me, 
miss dekker.

299
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,200
um, excuse me. i have to take this.

300
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,400
wealthy heiress, life of leisure,

301
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,500
a father who's been ravaging
the environment,

302
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:47,000
and now she's trying to buy a conscience 
by giving away some of her ill-gotten gains.

303
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,400
truth be told, i wouldn't 
like me either. 

304
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,600
Sorry. 

305
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,800
good news?

306
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,900
oh, it's just.. Private.

307
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,800
he's been trying to find the perfect moment to 
finally tell his pregnant girlfriend he loves her.

308
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:06,200
it's just, for taylor,
i need to go epic.

309
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,000
i don't remember the last time
a guy wanted to go epic for me.

310
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,600
her favorite singer's in town
for a concert,

311
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,100
but it's completely
and predictably sold out.

312
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,800
and i've even been bidding
for a pair of tickets on ebay,

313
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,700
but i have a feeling the guy
with the e-mail "sealtixordeath"

314
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,700
isn't gonna let me
just walk away with them.

315
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,900
seal--heidi's husband?

316
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,800
i could call her for you.

317
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,300
- heidi klum?
- yeah.

318
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,600
- you--you would do that for me?
- is this one worth it?

319
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,200
surprisingly, yes.

320
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,000
if there's one thing i've
learned, you can't buy love,

321
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,800
but you can, at the very least,
comp house seats.

322
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,500
- start liking her.
- heidi, hi.

323
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,700
this is very awkward.

324
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:57,500
i got a call from ted broden in accounting, 
and since we were tightening our belts,

325
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,800
he cautioned me against using the company 
credit card to book a hotel room.

326
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,200
i didn't know what he was talking 
about at first until i realized 

327
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,100
he'd called the wrong wethersby.

328
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,800
and you thought i was using firm money

329
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,900
to finance a pied- -terre
for extramarital activities.

330
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,200
honestly, that was only one of 
two possibilities i could think of,

331
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,400
and i was sort of hoping there was a
...third better explanation.

332
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,300
i'm sorry, but there isn't.

333
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,200
i have been living in a hotel of late.

334
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,200
daddy.

335
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,900
your stepmother and i came to the mutual 
decision to take some time apart.

336
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,000
i'm so sorry, dad.

337
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,600
after my accident, things were better 
than they'd been in some time,

338
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:45,700
as if we both realized we'd been given 
a second chance at marital bliss.

339
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,300
but as i've been--i hope the word is
"evolving"--

340
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,600
ellen and i have...drifted.

341
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,200
dad, why don't you come
and stay with me tonight?

342
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:03,600
it should come as no surprise that i'm not 
the sort of man to "crash" at anyone's pad,

343
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,500
but thank you for the offer.

344
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,600
can i at least offer you a hug?

345
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,500
that would be gratefully accepted.

346
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,100
who are you?

347
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,400
his name's mark young. nice offices.

348
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,500
- where's sean binder?
- we don't need sean binder.

349
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,900
- yes, we do. Angela--
- lied, eli, again, as usual.

350
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,400
so what does he have to do
with angela's case?

351
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,300
tell him.

352
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,900
this is like attorney client
secrets time, right?

353
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,900
i had to ask all of five people
on campus how to find you.

354
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,000
you think the d.a. Can't or won't do
the exact same thing?

355
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
or should i ring him up
right now, save him the legwork?

356
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,300
i'm ange's dealer.

357
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,400
at least i was
till she ran out of bank.

358
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,200
and i was gonna cut her off, but then 
she offered something to trade.

359
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,400
the fentanyl.

360
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,100
yeah, the stuff's like gold
on the street.

361
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,800
show him.

362
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:04,100
angela called him
a dozen times last month. Look.

363
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,500
get outta here.

364
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,300
we need to try and plead this.

365
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,700
what if he's covering for
someone else or setting her up?

366
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,700
- what the hell's
- you don't know her, keith.

367
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,600
she's a drug addict, eli.
no one knows her anymore.

368
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,200
i'm not looking to hurt angela,
all right? I like her.

369
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,300
i thought maybe even we...

370
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,100
look, i know you want her not to have 
done this, but as her friend, as her lawyer, 

371
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,200
you--you can't ignore the truth just 
because you wish it wasn't so.

372
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,000
why do you still believe her?

373
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:47,300
it was...revealed to me.

374
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,200
- revealed?
- mm-hmm.

375
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:56,300
um, i know you believe certain things, 
and--and that's--that's fine...

376
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,900
so long as it doesn't prevent you from seeing 
what's right in front of your face.

377
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,200
angela's guilty,

378
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,600
and if you can't see that, 
then we can't help her.

379
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,800
didn't i tell you not to show up here again

380
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,200
until you called that girl
whose number i gave you?

381
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,800
well, sorry. I, uh, had a lot on my plate.

382
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,100
finding out that patti's daughter 
is a drug dealer with a coke habit

383
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,000
hasn't really left me much time
for blind dating, so...

384
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,300
well, i'm sorry, eli,

385
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:37,300
but you're not gonna like or even understand 
every message you're tasked to deliver.

386
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,800
well, that sucks.

387
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,100
this is gonna destroy patti.

388
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,200
i swore to her that angela
was innocent, but she's not.

389
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,900
how do i deliver that message?

390
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,300
patti's strong. she'll persevere.
she has family. She has you.

391
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,200
yeah, i'm not sure how much good
having me is doing anyone.

392
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,300
anyone who gets close to me gets
kicked in the spiritual ass.

393
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,100
wait a second. is that why you don't 
want to go out on this date?

394
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,800
i-i don't need any more soul-broken 
people on my conscience.

395
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,200
eli, you've helped a lot of
people through some hard times.

396
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,800
what, like, uh, taylor? i helped her 
by breaking off our engagement. Hmm?

397
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,800
or maybe you meant maggie, who i helped 
out of her engagement and the firm.

398
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,700
or grace, who i helped
out of the country.

399
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,900
you think any of those people
think that they're better off

400
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,700
for the full and total
eli stone experience?

401
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,800
i do.

402
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:28,200
????is gonna bring you closer to
people, not further from them.

403
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,700
it's about connecting.

404
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,700
i've always been connected to patti.

405
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,200
she hasn't just recently
believed in eli the prophet.

406
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:40,300
she has always believed in just eli-- 

407
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,700
eli the lawyer, eli the jerk, eli,
the friend who is family.

408
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,300
i violated her trust.

409
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,600
i still can't believe
you got these tickets.

410
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,600
well, stone's not the only one
who can perform miracles.

411
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:03,800
besides, i know a guy
who knows a guy who knows seal.

412
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,600
it's the best gift. thank you.

413
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:10,100
yeah. Well, you're most welcome.

414
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,000
i wanted tonight to be special.

415
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,000
and why is that?

416
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,300
to tell you...

417
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,500
every night with you is special.

418
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,600
careful. that almost sounded sensitive.

419
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:30,900
i know this thing of ours hasn't unfolded
in t recommended... Order.

420
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,600
we've skipped some beats.

421
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:38,000
pole-vaulted over beats,
actually, but, um,

422
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,100
just because it's happened quickly...

423
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,100
doesn't mean it hasn't happened.

424
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,800
i love you, taylor.

425
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,800
ladies and gentlemen, seal.

426
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,700
what do you want me to say,
matt?

427
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,800
uh, i don't know. i guess i was 
expecting--call this crazy--

428
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,500
an "i love you, too." that's usually
how this goes.

429
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,200
it does when the other person
feels it, but i...

430
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,200
i just don't know if i do,

431
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,300
and i-i don't think it's fair
to say those words--even--

432
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,500
even with your child inside me--if... 

433
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,900
They're not what i feel.

434
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,000
you're the dude.

435
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,600
what?

436
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:55,700
a hot pregnant dude, sure, but in 
our relationship, you're the dude.

437
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,000
okay, i don't--i don't know
what that's supposed to mean.

438
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
i'm actually the mature one here,

439
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,500
which is another first for me.

440
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,100
but it's you...

441
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,900
you're the one who's afraid
to share her feelings.

442
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,800
u're the one who keeps pushing me away.

443
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:15,500
well, surprise, surprise, i'm in touch
with my feminine side.

444
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,800
maybe you should get in touch with yours. 
hope you liked the concert.

445
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,900
- matt.
- what's with the face?

446
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,800
the faces? Who died?

447
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,600
does this have anything
to do with angela?

448
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,000
patti, uh, i made a mistake.

449
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,500
- angela is not--
- no.

450
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,100
- uh, she stole the drugs from the hospital.
- no!

451
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:43,300
she gave them to a dealer named mark young 
to clear up a drug debt.

452
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,900
your daughter has
a substance abuse problem.

453
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,200
that's not possible, eli. you told me...

454
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,100
you said he told you--

455
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,100
i'm sorry, patti. you know, 
i-i love angie.

456
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,700
i didn't want to believe it either.

457
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,700
believe what?

458
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,200
you look me in the eye, and you tell me 
the truth, so help you god!

459
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,100
am i on the witness stand now?

460
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,500
did you talk to sean binder?

461
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,400
- he's the one who--
- stop lying!

462
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:14,400
now you need help, baby, but first,
you need to stop lying.

463
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,600
okay, mom.

464
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,800
your daughter's a drug addict.

465
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,600
she loves getting high.

466
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,800
this is not you. this--this isn't you.

467
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,600
how would you know, mom?

468
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,600
you don't know anything about me.

469
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,300
all you ever saw was
what you wanted me to be,

470
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,000
needed me to be.

471
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,200
god, the pressure
you put on me to be perfect!

472
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,000
 "i'm not raising ordinary kids."

473
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:53,300
like you're so special.
you're a damn secretary.

474
00:27:55,100 --> 00:28:00,100
yes, i'm a secretary who worked my ass off,

475
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,600
taking crap year after year,
weekends, nights,

476
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,000
so you could get opportunities
i never even dreamed of.

477
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,800
- i didn't ask for any of it!
- you didn't have to ask for it.

478
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,100
- i'm your mother.
- i didn't ask for that either!

479
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,400
if you werehalfthe mother
you think you are...

480
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,400
you would know how unhappy i am.

481
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:37,600
how...how unhappy i've been 
for a long time.

482
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,400
but you didn't want to see it...

483
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,000
because of your own problem, mom.

484
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:53,300
i guess this apple didn't
fall far from the tree.

485
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,100
patti...

486
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,700
what'd she mean by...

487
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,500
she meant both of us
never needed you more

488
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,900
and were never more wrong 
to put our faith in you.

489
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,200
- eli.
- hey.

490
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,200
i thought i was the only one here. 

491
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,100
you're here late.

492
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:44,100
i prefer the office to be empty before i indulge 
in my obsession with internet backgammon.

493
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,900
and why are you
burning the midnight oil?

494
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,400
patti.

495
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,200
i've been trying her all night, and she 
doesn't pick up or won't.

496
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,300
she has your home number, i'm sure.

497
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,800
used to think that nothing 
could get to her.

498
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,000
but today, she was...
she was gotten to.

499
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:10,200
i'm not in the habit
of breaking confidences, eli,

500
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:14,700
but you know i love patti
as much as you do.

501
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:19,500
and given the manner and magnitude 
of her daughter's troubles,

502
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,000
you should know something.

503
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,500
she has a problem, too?

504
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,400
yes. 

505
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:31,800
- Alcohol was her particular vice.
- "was"--you mean,

506
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,900
to my knowledge. This was years
ago, before you joined the firm,

507
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,900
back when she was my secretary.

508
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,400
her work had deteriorated,
when she even came to work.

509
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,500
one afternoon, i received
a phone call from a local bar.

510
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,400
patti had overstayed her welcome.

511
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,800
i went down there
and found her inebriated.

512
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,500
i told her she had to get help,
or i'd fire her.

513
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,000
so she got help then?

514
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,500
i believe the term is
"dry, not sober."

515
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,300
she just stopped drinking.

516
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:08,200
and you think that what's happening 
with angela has maybe...

517
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,600
pushed her off the wagon?

518
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:15,700
i think recovery programs
give addicts tools to rely on 

519
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,500
to get them through
difficult times--tools...

520
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
patti may not have.

521
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,700
you don't remember the name
of that bar, do you?

522
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,400
why do i get the feeling...

523
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,100
- you're not just going to the gym?
- get away from me, keith.

524
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,800
you gonna send eli the bond he'll forfeit 
when you jump bail? 

525
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,500
Or how about at least an address so your--

526
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,900
your mom knows which city morgue 
to collect your body at?

527
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,900
i'm not going to prison.

528
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,100
you think that's the worst thing
that can happen to you? 

529
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,400
Wrong.

530
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,300
you take off, things are
only gonna get worse.

531
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,600
w--your mom's right.
you are not yourself right now.

532
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,600
so tell me, which angela
do you want to be?

533
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:03,300
the druggiskell who blames her mother for 
her mistakes or the woman with brains

534
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,000
and--and spirit, the woman who scored a-a scholarship 
to the best med school in the state,

535
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,300
the woman i know can find
her way through this.

536
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,100
look, all the lies you told,
i never believed you,

537
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,300
but that's not the same thing
as not believing in you.

538
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,000
this is not court, keith, okay?

539
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,200
a pretty speech is
not gonna fix this.

540
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,600
no, and you got a lot to fix.

541
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,300
but i know you can.

542
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,400
just stop...stop trying
to prove me wrong.

543
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,300
what?

544
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,800
- what can i get for ya?
- her tab.

545
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:04,800
well, it's been a long time
since a man bought me a drink.

546
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,700
how gallant. 

547
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,500
so...

548
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,600
did jordan open his big mouth, or did god 
send a vision i needed a designated driver?

549
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,400
billy ocean got that hit
about driving a car.

550
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:24,800
how many times did i talk to you about 
my father? about his drinking problem?

551
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,700
why did you think
i wouldn't understand?

552
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,100
i am not a drunk, eli.

553
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:33,300
in case you haven't noticed,
i am having a bad week.

554
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,600
i don't need you coming here uninvited,

555
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,100
trying to make me feel worse,

556
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,300
when all i'm doing is trying to make 
myself feel a little better.

557
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,200
so how's that working out for ya?

558
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,000
- my daughter...
- is in trouble, a world of it.

559
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,900
she has a drug problem,
and she may go to prison.

560
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:58,900
she needs you now. but... Not like this.

561
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,400
she was right, eli.

562
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,800
it's--it's--it's my fault.

563
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:10,100
i pushed her too much. and look at me.

564
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,200
i'm a fraud.

565
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,100
i am a fraud.

566
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:22,000
she must have felt
so alone.

567
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,600
i left my baby alone.

568
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:34,700
this isn't her fault, none of it.

569
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,200
it's mine.

570
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,200
eli...she's innocent.

571
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,500
i've been angry

572
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:58,100
and--and confused...real angry.

573
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,800
but i'm not anymore, 'cause...

574
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,500
'cause i get it now.

575
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:10,000
all the people that i've been asked 
to help, all those, uh, strangers...

576
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,200
now i get to help
someone that i love.

577
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:21,300
and i really want to help you, patti.

578
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,200
but you--you gotta want my help.

579
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,400
probation, following rehab.

580
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
2,000 hours community service at the free 
medical clinic in the mission district.

581
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,800
- but no jail?
- no jail.

582
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,200
what about medical school?

583
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,700
golden state won't take her back, 
but if angela really wants to be a doctor,

584
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,900
she'll find a way.

585
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,300
how did you manage all this, eli?

586
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,100
when i was a public defender,

587
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:00,800
i represented a bad guy accused
of cutting up his girlfriend.

588
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,600
jarrells was the d.a. The cops
couldn't find the knife.

589
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,000
i got the case tossed.

590
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,400
what does that got to do
with angela's case?

591
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:14,200
the cops recently received an anonymous tip 
with the knife's whereabouts.

592
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,300
the d.a. Was grateful.

593
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,000
- so we accept the terms?
- yes. Yes.

594
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,600
thank you... Both.

595
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,200
thank you.

596
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,600
i'm so sorry for what i said.

597
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,200
i didn't mean those things.

598
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,500
it's okay...even if you did.

599
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,700
some of it is true.

600
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,800
i love you, angela...

601
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:06,700
so much that my teeth hurt sometimes.

602
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,500
okay. you're not a child anymore,

603
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:19,700
and i cannot fix all of your problems, 
especially when i have some big ones of my own.

604
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:26,400
so... Maybe we help each other.

605
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,900
you were right about angela...
the whole time.

606
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,500
i should have trusted
your instincts.

607
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,800
who could blame you? you know, it's hard 
to compete with the big guy.

608
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,800
yeah. maybe god could be a little less
indirect next time.

609
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,200
actually, i meant john lennon.

610
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,400
i'll tell you, though,

611
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,800
what i wouldn't give
to see what you see

612
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,400
just once.

613
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:05,100
eli, care to join me for dinner?

614
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,500
oh, uh, actually, i...

615
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,900
i'm just--i'm going on a blind date.

616
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,300
- mm.
- i...

617
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,100
makes sense. I appear to have run out of 
daughters and associates for you to romance.

618
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,500
are you okay? 

619
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,100
It's just--i've--i've noticed 
lots of late nights,

620
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,500
and you got nothing better to do
than grab a bite with me.

621
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,900
ellen and i have separated.

622
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,300
wow.

623
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,400
sorry. I... Uh, is there
anything i can do?

624
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,300
a tale of woe for another night.

625
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,300
you have someone waiting.

626
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,200
and, eli, 

627
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:50,000
when you and i do grab a bite, it won't be 
because i have nothing better to do.

628
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,800
you're speechless. it's gotta be a first.

629
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,400
i think we've said or not said all there 
is to say or not say.

630
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,600
what you said last night--it--it couldn't 
have been easy taking a chance like that,

631
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,800
and i'm sorry, i am so sorry, 
i couldn't take that leap with you.

632
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,600
like you said, you can't
say what you don't feel.

633
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:25,000
no, but i should have said what i am ??

634
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,800
i should have said that i...

635
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:32,600
don't know if i love you...yet.

636
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,600
yeah, there's a reason no one's
ever written a hit song

637
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,400
called "i don't know if i love you yet."

638
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,400
i'm my father's daughter, matt.

639
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,800
sharing my feelings with someone
is very difficult for me.

640
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,300
and the one time i actually did
truly open my heart to someone,

641
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,500
he... Broke off our engagement.

642
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,700
and then came "the dowd"--

643
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:01,200
a guy i didn't even think i'd give a drawer 
to in my apartment, and...

644
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,800
it's taken me a while
to make that switch...

645
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,100
but i'm making it.

646
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,800
i only know one thing,
that you and me...

647
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,800
but especily me...

648
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,100
we're never gonna survive
unless...

649
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,800
we get a little crazy.

650
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:33,800
how'd you...

651
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:37,700
i know people who know people who know maggie, 
who knows people who know seal.

652
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,100
forget "like." i think i love you.

653
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,300
at's the point of being
a disgustingly rich heiress

654
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,700
if you can't do stuff like this, right?

655
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,900
now this is epic. Thank you.

656
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,600
????

657
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,500
welcome.

658
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,900
<font color="#ffff00">welcome to www.1000fr.com</font> 

659
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,200
- sorry i'm late. I'm eli.
- i'm ashley.

660
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:43,900
hi, ashley. have you been waiting long?

661
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,900
no, not at all.

662
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,900
- you look beautiful.
- thank you.
