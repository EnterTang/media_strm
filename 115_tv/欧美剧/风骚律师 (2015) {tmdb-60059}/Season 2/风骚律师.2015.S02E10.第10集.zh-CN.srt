放射科t生f 查斯的^和脊椎
The radiologist said everything looks normal

323
00:20:21,392 --> 00:20:23,092
看起硪磺姓常
with Charles' head and spine,

324
00:20:23,127 --> 00:20:24,927
所以我摘了i托
so we took his neck collar off.

325
00:20:24,962 --> 00:20:26,562
他^上的K合也不e
His head wound will heal just fine.

00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:36,205
心D正常
The EKG was normal.

332
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,408
至於失去知X 我的想法是
As far as losing consciousness, my best guess is

333
00:20:39,443 --> 00:20:42,711
查斯得了所^的激性昏厥
Charles had what's called a stress-related syncope.

334
00:20:42,747 --> 00:20:44,913
基本上就是@恐l作
It's basically a panic attack,

335
00:20:44,949 --> 00:20:49,351
但是]有中L或心K病的E象

他怎N了
What's wrong with him?

342
00:21:14,612 --> 00:21:16,478
不管你打了什N 效都已退了 是吧
Whatever you gave him should've worn off already, right?

343
00:21:16,514 --> 00:21:18,714
我^察了小r
We watched him for several hours.

344
00:21:18,749 --> 00:21:21,083
我甚至o了他逆D
We even gave him what's called a reversal agent.

345

所以f 然 o┳饔孟退了

When I first treated Charles, he was in a similar state.

357
00:21:47,645 --> 00:21:48,944
你X得呢
Wouldn't you agree?

358
00:21:52,483 --> 00:21:55,150
我必不得不相信 他清醒^
I have to believe that it's just a matter of time

You can put 3,500 through it and never know.

366
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:27,783
取Q於射舻淖力
It's about how tight she shoots.

367
00:22:27,818 --> 00:22:30,352
@一的座力就很大
And this one's tight as they come.

你的管冷s了
Your barrel gonna be cold?

370
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,661
希望如此
Let's suppose so.

371
00:22:39,697 --> 00:22:41,697
好吧 你最好把注意力放在射羯
Well, then, you'd better have paid attention to that shot.

372
00:22:41,732 --> 00:22:44,733

But as you know, you'll have to recalculate the shot.

383
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,440
