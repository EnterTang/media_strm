1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,700
HEY THERE, STRANGER. I MISSED YOU.

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,500
LOOKS LIKE YOU MAY HAVE MISSED A SPOT.

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,700
YOU'RE NAKED.

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,700
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,600
 WHERE ARE YOUR CLOTHES?

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,400
   UM, WELL,FIRST STEP IN SHOWERING

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,800
IS USUALLY TAKING THEM OFF,   WEIRDO.

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,000
NOW WHERE WAS I?

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,600
 (grunts) YOU KNOW, I CAN'T
  DO THIS WITHOUT MY COFFEE.

10
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,700
 -OKAY, WHY ARE YOU COVERING YOUR EYES?
-I'M NOT.

11
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,600
 ARE YOU JOKING? 

12
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:31,900
YOU'RE NOT JOKING.

13
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,500
   I JUST... I GOTTA...

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,300
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,900
 I'VE BARELY SEEN YOU THIS WEEK.

16
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,200
YOU WORK LATE EVERY NIGHT.

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,600
OKAY, WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO TALK
   ABOUT OUR ENGAGEMENT PARTY.

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,300
ENGAGEMENT PARTY?

19
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,500
  YEAH, WITH EVERYTHING  GOING ON AT WORK,

20
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,500
 YOU'D THINK YOU COULD
   HELP ME OUT FOR FIVE MINUTES.

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,500
JEEZ, SCOTT, I-I DON'T KNOW
  WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU LATELY.

22
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,600
YOU WERE HER FIANC?

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,400
 KIND OF A "QUANTUM LEAPER,"  HUH?

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,900
   DID YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID? WE WERE NAKED.

25
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,200
I-I HAD TO LOOK AWAY  SO I DIDN'T, UH...

26
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,000
WELL, I MAY HAVE GLANCED. 
 I AM HUMAN.

27
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,200
BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

28
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,300
IN GREEK MYTHOLOGY,
  GODS OFTEN DISGUISE THEMSELVES

29
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,300
AS MORTALS SO THEY COULD SPY   ON THEIR SUBJECTS

30
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,800
   AND TEST THEIR LOYALTIES.

31
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,900
 WELL, NOT THAT I MIND
BEING COMPARED TO ZEUS,

32
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,700
BUT I DON'T NEED TO SPY ON MAGGIE

33
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,100
TO KNOW HER LOYALTIES.

34
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,700
 ZEUS PLAYED THESE GAMES

35
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,100
  WITH WOMEN FOR WHOM
   HE HAD SPECIAL AFFECTION.

36
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,300
OH, DON'T START.

37
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,000
WHATEVER HAPPENED LAST YEAR
WITH ME AND MAGGIE,

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,400
WHICH WAS NOTHING,    BY THE WAY,

39
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,800
 IS OVER, DONE WITH AND FORGOTTEN, OKAY?

40
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,500
ANY AFFECTION I HAVE FOR HER   IS PURELY PROFESSIONAL.

41
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,900
 WELL, MAYBE IT HAS SOMETHING
 TO DO WITH A CASE.

42
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,400
IF YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED,    THESE VISIONS USUALLY DO.

43
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,700
IT HAS TO DO WITH HER.

44
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,400
THIS IS TWO MAGGIE VISIONS IN A ROW.

45
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,100
LAST WEEK SHE'S AT THE SUPREME COURT

46
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,500
WITH--WITH POSNER & KLEIN

47
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,900
   AND THIS WEEK SHE'S IN THE SHOWER WITH ME. 

48
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,700
MAYBE POSNER MADE HER
AN OFFER AT HIS FIRM.

49
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,400
   WELL, IF GOD IS  SENDING YOU VISIONS

50
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,500
 ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT    MAGGIE IS CHANGING FIRMS,

51
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,100
 WHICH, YOU KNOW,  GIVEN HIS BUSY SCHEDULE

52
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,400
 AND SEEMINGLY MORE PRESSING  PRIORITIES, I HIGHLY DOUBT,

53
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,100
  ONE THING WE'VE LEARNED IS
  YOUR VISIONS OF THE FUTURE CAN BE ALTERED. 

54
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,500
YOU CAN CHANGE DESTINY. DON'T LET HER GO.

55
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,800
 IT'S A COMMON MISUNDERSTANDING
  THAT A PUBLIC INTEREST FIRM

56
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,500
  CAN'T BE PROFITABLE, BUT I ASSURE YOU

57
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,200
WE WILL SUCCEED.

58
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,100
   AND THE BENEFITS?

59
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,900
 THE FIRM'S TAHOE SKI RETREAT

60
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,800
 WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE
TO SUCCESSFUL ATTORNEYS.

61
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,400
   CLIENTS YOU CARE  PASSIONATELY ABOUT.

62
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,300
BLUE-CHIP CLIENTS OPERATING AT THE FOREFRONT OF GLOBAL COMMERCE.

63
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,400
 OUR MISSION WILL BE TO USE THE LAW

64
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,800
 AS THE HIGHEST FORM  OF SOCIAL ACTIVISM.

65
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,000
A DIFFERENT GUEST CHEF WILL BE
FLOWN IN EVERY MONDAY.

66
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,700
   WHAT YOU GIVE UP
 IN SIMPLE DOLLARS AND CENTS

67
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,500
  YOU WILL MORE THAN MAKE UP   IN QUALITY OF LIFE.

68
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,000
 THIS IS GOING TO BE 
THE SINGLE LEAST SUSPENSEFUL  MEETING OF MY DAY.

69
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,700
   ACTUALLY, I HAVEN'T MADE UP MY MIND YET, SIR.

70
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,400
 REALLY?

71
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,400
  BECAUSE MARCI AND I   WOULD LIKE YOU TO CONSIDER

72
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,000
   JOINING OUR FIRM   AS A FULL PARTNER.

73
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,600
CAN YOU BELIEVE    HOW EASILY PEOPLE ARE BOUGHT?

74
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,700
THE EXODUS HAS BEGUN.

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
   ONLY THE MORALLY BANKRUPT
AND WEAK-MINDED.

76
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,700
  NO ONE LIKED   YOUR WIFE'S BANANA BREAD.

77
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,600
WE ONLY ATE IT TO BE POLITE!

78
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,900
 HOW ARE THE ASSISTANTS
AND THE JUNIOR STAFF HOLDING UP?

79
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,200
   NONE OF MY ROOSTERS ARE GONNA FLY THIS COOP.

80
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,500
YOU'RE THE BEST, PATTI.

81
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,400
 I ASSUME THAT WILL BE REFLECTED
  IN MY CHRISTMAS BONUS?

82
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,600
HEY.

83
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,700
GOOD TO SEE YOU...

84
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,700
 CLOTHED... NICELY.

85
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,600
HOW ARE YOU?

86
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,900
   HORRIBLE.

87
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,900
LOOK, I KNOW THE FIRM'S SPLIT
HAS LEFT SOME PEOPLE

88
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,500
WITH SOME VERY STRESSFUL DECISIONS.

89
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,500
YOU'RE TELLING ME.

90
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,800
   SO POSNER DID MAKE YOU AN OFFER.

91
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,300
HE DIDN'T EVEN ASK FOR A MEETING.

92
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,100
-OH, THAT'S GREAT.
-GREAT? 

93
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,800
HE'S MET TH EVERY SINGLE OTHER ASSOCIATE HERE.

94
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,300
MY ENGAGEMENT PARTY'S FRIDAY, ELI.

95
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,400
  THE TIMING OF ALL THIS COULDN'T BE WORSE.

96
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,100
   LITERALLY HALF MY GUEST LIST CALLED
   IN THE LAST FEW HOURS  TO CANCEL.

97
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,800
 GUESS THEY FEEL AWKWARD
ABOUT DOING THE MACARENA

98
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,800
  WITH SOON-TO-BE EX-COWORKERS.

99
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,900
  I DON'T KNOW WHICH TERRIFIES ME MORE--

100
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,900
THE FACT THAT WE'LL BE DOING
 THE MACARENA AT YOUR PARTY

101
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,300
 OR THAT YOUR GUESTS ARE
ALL PEOPLE WHO WORK HERE.

102
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,000
   WELL, LET'S FACE IT.  I WORK 80 HOURS A WEEK.

103
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,600
 MY LIFE IS SCOTT AND YOU...

104
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,500
  THIS FIRM.

105
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,400
   WELL, THIS PLACE IS--
   WELL, WAS--MY FAMILY.

106
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,300
AND WE STILL WILL BE, ONLY SMALLER.

107
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,900
YOU CAN'T LEAVE, MAGGIE.

108
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,500
  WHY WOULD YOU EVER THINK I WOULD?

109
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,200
  POSNER IS LIKE   DARTH SIDIOUS.

110
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,200
  WELL, THEN BEWARE THE DARK SIDE.

111
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,400
MISS DEKKER?

112
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,300
 MR. POSNER WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU.

113
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,900
 THANKS.

114
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,300
   WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
THAT I COULD CONVINCE MATT

115
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,700
 NOT TO LEAVE OR THAT I WOULD WANT TO?

116
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,500
  HE JUST NEEDS A GENTLE PUSH.

117
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,100
  WELL, HE'S <i>YOUR</i> BOYFRIEND, TAYLOR.

118
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,700
DID YOU TRY  THE RED NIGHTIE THING?

119
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,800
  THAT CERTAINLY   CONVINCED ME TO, UH...

120
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,100
THAT'S INAPPROPRIATE. NOTED.

121
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,300
JUST PUT HIM ON A CASE  WITH YOU, YOU KNOW?

122
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,500
SHOW HIM ALL THE GREAT THINGS
 ABOUT PUBLIC INTEREST LAW,

123
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,600
 HOW AMAZING IT FEELS TO REALLY HELP PEOPLE.

124
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,200
   SHOW HIM SOME OF THAT STONE MAGIC.

125
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,300
THIS IS MATT DOWD.

126
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,100
 <i>YOU</i> DON'T EVEN BELIEVE IN THE STONE MAGIC.

127
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,000
PLEASE, ELI?

128
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,100
 I NEED THIS.

129
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,800
HE'S GONNA SEE   RIGHT THROUGH ME.

130
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,100
YOU NEED ME? 

131
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,100
YOU <i>NEED</i> ME?

132
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,100
FOR WHAT?

133
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,700
MY ANALYTICAL MIND? 

134
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,800
MY INNATE  COMMAND OF CIVIL PROCEDURE?

135
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,600
-OH, MY DEFT--   
- YOU HAVE AN EDGE.

136
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,100
 SOME MAY CALL IT OBNOXIOUS,

137
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,700
  BUT THAT ADVERSARIAL EDGE

138
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,300
IN COURT CAN SOMETIMES--

139
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,800
OH, SHUT UP, STONE. 

140
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,800
I KNOW TAYLOR PUT YOU UP TO THIS.

141
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,000
  YOU CAN'T LET HER KNOW I TOLD YOU.

142
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,700
 YOU DIDN'T.

143
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,800
YOU'RE AS TRANSPARENT  AS WINDOWPANE.

144
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,300
THEY'VE OFFERED ME PARTNER.

145
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,700
  I'VE MADE UP MY MIND.

146
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,100
I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO TELL HER.

147
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,900
 IS THERE A GOOD WAY
TO TELL YOUR GIRLFRIEND THAT

148
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,000
YOU'RE GONNA WORK FOR THE PEOPLE
WHO POLEAXED HER FATHER?

149
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,500
PROBABLY NOT, NO.

150
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,500
   SO DON'T SAY YES YET.

151
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,000
 YOU OWE HER TO AT LEAST
PRETEND TO MULL IT OVER.

152
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,400
BESIDES, YOU KNOW, YOU MAKE
  POSNER & KLEIN SWEAT OVER THIS FOR A WEEK, 

153
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,800
THEY'LL PROBABLY   RAISE YOUR OFFER.

154
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,100
WELL, I DO WANT A CORNER OFFICE.

155
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,700
ME--SENIOR ASSOCIATE?

156
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,600
   IN CHARGE OF YOUR PRO BONO DEPARTMENT?

157
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,700
AT DOUBLE YOUR CURRENT SALARY.

158
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,700
COME ON.

159
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,500
 I NEVER KID ABOUT MONEY

160
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,200
 OR ABOUT FOUR WEEKS   PAID VACATION TIME 

161
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,100
 TO DO SOME   OF YOUR SPECIAL PROJECTS--

162
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,800
MOTHER TERESA'S NEXT JUNKET.

163
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,400
I THINK MOTHER TERESA'S DEAD, SIR.

164
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,200
 WELL, THEN SOMEONE ELSE  ALIVE AND WELL

165
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,500
AND WHINING  ABOUT THE RAIN FOREST.

166
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,600
BUT I THOUGHT YOU AND MS. KLEIN
DON'T EVEN LIKE PRO BONO WORK.

167
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,500
DON'T LET MY DISDAIN  R ALL THINGS TIE-DYED FOOL YOU, MS. DEKKER.

168
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,700
EVEN I UNDERSTAND THAT
 MAKING MONEY AND DOING GOOD

169
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,700
 ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.    IT'S GOOD P.R.,

170
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,300
  AND THERE'S ALSO THIS.

171
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,600
 $20,000 TO THE ECO PRESERVATION LEAGUE?

172
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,100
   A GESTURE OF GOODWILL
 TO SHOW YOU HOW SERIOUS  I AM ABOUT THIS.

173
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,000
JUST CONSIDER IT   AN EARLY ENGAGEMENT GIFT.

174
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,500
   ALL I ASK IS YOU TAKE A FEW DAYS.

175
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,300
JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

179
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,600
  PATTI, 

180
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,400
YOU KNOW THAT BOX   YOU'VE BEEN KEEPING FOR ME

181
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,900
  WITH ALL THE FAXES AND LETTERS
  FROM POTENTIAL CLIENTS?

182
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,800
YOU MEAN THE WACKADOO FILE?

183
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,100
 I MEAN THE BOX   WITH ALL THE FASCINATING,

184
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,500
  COMPLEX LEGAL DILEMMAS

185
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,700
 THAT COULD ONE DAY
END UP IN THE SUPREME COURT.

186
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,500
WELL, WHAT I HAVE IS A BOX FULL OF CASES
FROM THE NUT BALLS

187
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,500
THAT SAW YOU ON THE NEWS--

188
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,300
THE WACKADOO FILE.   

189
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,700
 COULD I JUST HAVE IT?

190
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,900
 HERE'S ONE,

191
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,100
 AND I HAVE
THREE MORE IN THE SUPPLY CLOSET.

192
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,900
  NOW... 

193
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,900
SOME OF THESE CASES
ARE QUITE SIGNIFICANT.

194
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,500
 IT'S ALL ABOUT FINDING   THE DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH.

195
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,100
 SNOOZE.

196
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,000
   THE ENVIRONMENT MAKES YOU  WANT TO NAP. I GOT IT.

197
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,100
WELL, HERE'S A FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUE.

198
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,100
MAN WANTS TO SUE HIS LANDLORD
FOR CLEARING OUT MOLD

199
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,600
WHICH LOOKS LIKE JESUS.

200
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,200
 JESUS MOLD... PASS.

201
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,800
OH, WE MAY HAVE SOMETHING HERE--

202
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,900
 TWIN SISTER FLIGHT ATTENDANTS.

203
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,600
 SEE,   NOW THIS SOUNDS PROMISING.

204
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,700
THEY WANT TO SUE THE AIRLINE   THAT FIRED THEM
WHEN THEY TURNED 60.

205
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,700
 PATTI! 

206
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,600
CAN WE GET ANOTHER BOX IN HERE?

207
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,700
YOU SURE YOU WOULDN'T
 RATHER SEE A LIVING CLIENT?

208
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,400
THIS IS HOW MY CASES  USUALLY COME IN.

209
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,100
  MR. STONE?

210
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,600
-YEAH.
-HEY, I'M WILL SONNEBORN.

211
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,000
HI. UM, THIS IS MY ASSOCIATE,  MATT DOWD.

212
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,300
WHAT CAN WE DO FOR YOU?

213
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,600
  I NEED YOU TO HELP MY GIRLFRIEND.

214
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,400
  HOMELAND SECURITY ARRESTED HER
AND HER HUSBAND YESTERDAY.

215
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,000
   I REALIZE    THESE ARE CONFUSING TIMES.

216
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,800
   POSNER'S PROBABLY  MAKING SOME OF YOU OFFERS--

217
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,300
 SUBSTANTIAL OFFERS.

218
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,700
  BUT AS THE ASSISTANT
  WHO'S BEEN HERE THE LONGEST,

219
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,200
  I WANT TO REMIND YOU
THAT JORDAN AND ELI CARE

220
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,700
 FOR EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU.

221
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,100
 THEN WHY IS IT THE FIRST THING THEY DID

222
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,500
   WAS FREEZE  NEXT YEAR'S WAGE INCREASES?

223
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,700
   THAT'S A LOT TO DEAL WITH
IN THIS ECONOMY.

224
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,300
  JORDAN'S VISION   FOR THIS FIRM IS REAL.

225
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,500
HE AND ELI WANT TO CHANGE THINGS
  TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

226
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,200
 NO OFFENSE, PATTI,

227
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,900
BUT ELI'S A LITTLE ECCENTRIC.

228
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,200
   ELI MAY BE... UNORTHODOX,

229
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,800
   BUT I'VE SEEN WHAT HE CAN DO,

230
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,700
 AND BELIEVE ME WHEN I TELL YOU

231
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,500
   IT'S MEANINGL,  IT'S INSPIRATIONAL.

232
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,900
  THIS NEW FIRM  WILL BE A PLACE

233
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,200
THAT WE CAN BE PROUD   TO COME TO EVERY DAY.

234
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,000
  HOW OFTEN DOES THAT HAPPEN?

235
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,500
GET THEM TO LIFT THE WAGE FREEZE
   AND WE'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

236
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,300
 YEAH.

237
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,300
 GREAT.

238
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,700
 I'LL TALK TO ELI, WORK  SOMETHING OUT FOR ALL OF US.

239
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,200
 COULD YOU  EXPLAIN THAT AGAIN?

240
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,700
 WILL IS MY BOYFRIEND.

241
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,000
 HE GIVES HER SEX, BUT I GIVE HER EMOTIONAL SUPPORT

242
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,200
 AND SOMEONE TO WATCH "PROJECT RUNWAY" WITH.

243
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,900
 CARTER, CAN YOU PLEASE   BE SERIOUS? HE'S KIDDING.

244
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,000
SO WHO IS HE TO YOU?    

245
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,900
CARTER IS MY BEST FRIEND,    ALSO MY--

246
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,700
GAY GREEN CARD HUSBAND.

247
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,200
  OH, THAT CLEARS IT RIGHT UP.

248
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,900
SANA AND CARTER WERE IN
 THE SAME PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAM  AT BERKELEY.

249
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,400
AND WE'VE BEEN B.F.F.s  EVER SINCE.

250
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,900
HOW DID I.C.E. GET INVOLVED?

251
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,300
 WHEN MY STUDENT VISA RAN OUT.

252
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,100
I WAS SUPPOSED TO RETURN   TO PAKISTAN,

253
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,300
 BUT WILL AND I    WERE JUST GETTING
  TO REALLY KNOW ONE ANOTHER.

254
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,300
WE WERE FALLING IN LOVE

255
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,700
I COULDN'T JUST LEAVE.

256
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,400
I HAD NALLY FOUND HAPPINESs

257
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,500
I TRIED TO EXTEND MY STUDENT
   VISA, 

258
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,600
GET A WORK VISA.

259
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,000
  NOTHING WORKED.

260
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,900
I MARRIED HER

261
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,600
 SO SHE COULD
STAY HERE AND FALL IN LOVE.

262
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,900
WHY DIDN'T YOU   JUST MARRY WILL?

263
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,500
  I WOULD HAVE. I WANTED TO.

264
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,500
  IT WAS TOO EARLY IN OUR RELATIONSHIP.

265
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,800
I DIDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE
 ASKING HIM TO DO THAT.

266
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,900
   HOW DID HOMELAND SECURITY
   REALIZE THAT THE MARRIAGE   WAS A FRAUD?

267
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,000
I HAD AN UGLY BREAKUP  WITH THIS JACKASS

268
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,400
WHO KNEW THE WHOLE STORY.

269
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,700
   MY REMOVAL HEARING  IS THIS WEEK.

270
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,300
 AFTER WHICH YOU FACE
 UP TO FIVE YEARS IN PRISON.

271
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,300
 YOU HAVE TO HELP THEM.

272
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,200
   THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO.
  YOU COMMITTED FRAUD,

273
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,700
 AND IN POST-9/11 AMERICA, THAT
 MEANS YOU'RE GOING TO PRISON,

274
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,400
AND YOU'RE GOING BACK TO PAKISTAN.

275
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,600
  THAT CAN'T HAPPEN.

276
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,700
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE.

277
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,100
TELL 'EM, SANA.

278
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,900
UH, SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO RETURN
HOME TO AN ARRANGED MARRIAGE.

279
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,700
 BUT I COULDN'T   GO THROUGH WITH IT,

280
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,900
NOT AFTER I MET WILL..

281
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,400
  NOT AFTER I KNEW REAL LOVE.

282
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,500
   IF SHE GOES BACK TO PAKISTAN,
 HER FAMILY WILL KILL HER.

283
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,300
LET'S GET A MOVE ON,  MACARONI.

284
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,000
THOSE CATERERS ARE NOT
  GONNA WAIT AROUND FOREVER,

285
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,600
AND WE ALREADY  RESCHEDULED TWICE.

286
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,400
I'M COMING.

287
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,300
HEY!

288
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,100

289
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,100
I'M GLAD YOU GUYS CAN BE THERE.

290
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,500
  THERE'S A LOT TO CELEBRATE.

291
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,900
BESIDES YOUR ENGAGEMENT, YOU MEAN?

   HEY, COULD I HAVE A WORD WITH

295
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,100

  WELL, HE... HE GAVE ME A REALLY HARD SELL.

SO YOU TOLD HIM NO.

300
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,000
 I-I DIDN'T WANT TO BE RUDE.

301
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,500
 I TOLD HIM I'D... I'D THINK    ABOUT IT FOR A FEW DAYS.

302
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,000

 THE ENVIRONMENT AND STUFF.

305
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,900
HOW MUCH IS HE GONNA PAY?

306
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,200

307
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,000

308
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,800
I'M NOW A PARTNER AT THIS FIRM,

309
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,300
   TRUST ME, I'M GONNATAKE CARE OF THIS, MAGGIE

310
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,300
 NO WONDER MARTIN POSNER
  WAS ALWAYS SO PRICKLY

311
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,500
 HANDLING W.P.K.'s FINANCES.

312
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,500
 IT WAS A HUGE TASK
WHEN WE <i>HAD</i> REVENUE.

313
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,000
MAYBE WE SHOULD CONSIDER PUTTING
  THE BUILDING ON THE MARKET,

314
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,500
DOWNSIZING.

315
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,700
  WHAT KIND OF STATEMENT WOULD THAT MAKE?

316
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,100
-DAD--
- SWEETIE, PLEASE STOP TAKING   THE STRESS ON YOURSELF.

317
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,500
   I'M FINE.

318
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,300
I'M JUST NOT SLEEPING.

319
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,400
 OR HUNGRY. THERE'S JUST A LOT
OF LIFE CHANGES AHEAD, YOU KNOW?

320
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,900
   YES, I HAVE A FEELING  I DO KNOW.

321
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,500
 HONEY,IF THERE'S EVER ANYTHING
  YOU'D LIKE TO TALK TO ME ABOUT...

322
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,400
  MAGGIE DEKKER JUST RECEIVED
 AN OFFER FROM POSNER & KLEIN--

323
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,800
   A SUBSTANTIAL ONE.  WE HAVE TO MATCH IT.

324
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,500
ELI, WE CAN'T AFFORD TO.  AND BESIDES,

325
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,100
  MAGGIE'S THE LAST PERSON
WHO'S GONNA GO WORK FOR THEM.

326
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,200
THAT'S NOT TRUE.SHE'LL LEAVE. I KNOW IT.

327
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,600
   ELI, I UNDERSTD YOU HAVE  A SPECIAL AFFECTION FOR MS. DEKKER.

328
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,000
  WHY DOES EVERYBODY   KEEP SAYING THAT

329
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

330
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,800
 SHE'S A FRIEND,  A PLATONIC ONE.

331
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,800
SHE BELIEVED IN ME
 BEFORE ANYONE ELSE DID.

332
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,700
  I REALIZE THAT, 

333
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,200
BUT WE HAVEN'T  MATCHED POSNER'S SALARY OFFER
FOR ANY OTHER ASSOCIATE.

334
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,200
WELL, IF WE WANT  TO KEEP THEM--

335
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,500
YOU'RE A PARTNER NOW, ELI.

336
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,000
YOU'VE GOT TO START THINKING    LIKE ONE, 

337
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,300
WHICH MEANS NOT ALLOWING SENTIMENT
TO CLOUD YOUR JUDGMENT.

338
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,600
 IT MEANS WORRYING ABOUT HOW WE
FUND OUR QUARTERLY CONTRIBUTIONS

339
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,500
  TO THE ASSOCIATES' HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN,

340
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,800
HOW WE KEEP OUR OFFICES LIT
   AND WARM THIS WINTER

341
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,400
AMIDST SKYROCKETING  ELECTRIC BILLS.

342
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,400
BUT IF YOU TRULY THINK MAGGIE'S
PRESENCE AT OUR FIRM JUSTIFIES

343
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,000
  TREATING HER DIFFERENTLY
¢TTHAN ALL THE OTHER ASSOCIATES

344
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,300
AND PLACING OUR OBLIGATIONS
 TO THEM AT GREATER RISK,

345
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,800
IT'S YOUR CALL.

346
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,300
I THOUGHT YOU WERE TAKING THE DAY OFF

347
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,900
 TO, UH, PREPARE FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT PARTY.

348
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,600
OH, JUST STOPPED BY  TO PICK UP A FEW THINGS

349
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,200
  BEFORE THE PARENTS ARRIVE.

350
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,400
LOOK, I SPOKE TO JORDAN,

351
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,000
AND THE THING IS,

352
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
   WE'RE LOSING NEARLY ALL
OUR REVENUE-STREAMING CLIENTS.

353
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,500
AND I TRIED TO FIGURE OUT
  A WAY AS BEST I COULD

354
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,200
TO MATCH POSNER'S OFFER, BUT--

355
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,200
ELI, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

356
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,700
-IT DOESN'T?
-  THIS FIRM CHANGED MY LIFE.

357
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,600
   AND YOU--WELL, THE FIRM--

358
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,000
  MADE ME SEE FOR THE FIRST TIME
 I COULD MAKE A TRUE DIFFERENCE.

359
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,400
I COULD NEVER LEAVE.

360
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,700
 I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW HAPPY  I AM TO HEAR THAT.

361
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,400
STONE, WE'RE LATE FOR COURT.

362
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,800
   LISTEN, DEKKER,UH, THIS, UH, PARTY OF YOURS--

363
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,400
IS THAT MORE LIKE A GIFT THING,

364
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,000
OR IS A WEDDING PRESENT ENOUGH?

365
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,300
  IT'S A DIFFERENT WORLD OVER THERE.

366
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,000
IN PAKISTAN, I AM CONSIDERED MY FATHER'S PROPERTY.

367
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,200
HIS HONOR IS DEFINED BY MY PURITY.

368
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,200
BY ENTERING INTO A SEXUAL
 RELATIONSHIP WITH A MAN

369
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,900
OTHER THAN THE ONE CHOSEN FOR YOU...

370
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,400
I BECAME <i>KARI--</i>

371
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,100
 AN IMPURE WOMAN.

372
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,400
AND WHAT IS THE PUNISHMENT
FOR BECOMING <i>KARI?</i>

373
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,400
  THE ONLY WAY FOR MY FATHER TO RESTORE HIS HONOR

374
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,400
 IS TO KILL THE ONE WHO DAMAGED IT--ME--

375
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,200
PREFERABLY PUBLICLY,  SO ALL CAN WITNESS

376
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,700
   HIS HONOR BEING RESTORED.

377
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,600
  OBJECTION--WHAT HAPPENS
TO CERTAIN WOMEN IN PAKISTAN

378
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,000
  IS HORRIBLE, OF COURSE,

379
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,100
BUT IT'S NOT AT ISSUE HERE

380
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,400
  UH, IT IS WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO SEND HER BACK TO PAKISTAN.

381
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,600
I AGREE.   OBJECTION OVERRULED.

382
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,600
   MISS BOOKER SEEMED   TO IMPLY JUST NOW

383
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,900
  THAT HONOR KILLINGS  ARE RARE IN PAKISTAN.

384
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,600
HUNDREDS OF GIRLS ARE MURDERED EACH YEAR.

385
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,300
MY FRIEND WAS BURNED BECAUSE  SHE KISSED THE WRONG BOY.

386
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,900
  HER BODY LAY IN THE STREET FOR TWO HOURS.

387
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,900
NO ONE DID ANYTHING.

388
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,400
THANK YOU, SANA.

389
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,600
NOTHING FURTHER.

390
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,600
I GUESS YOU'RE UNAWARE THAT
HONOR KILLINGS IN PAKISTAN

391
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,400
 HAVE BEEN OUTLAWED
FOR THREE YEARS NOW.

392
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,600
  ONE LAW CANNOT CHANGE  ANCIENT CUSTOMS.

393
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,300
  AND EVEN IF IT COULD, THE LAW MUST STILL BE ENFORCED.

394
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,500
BUT ALL THE PROSECUTORS ARE MEN.

395
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,100
ALL THE JUDGES ARE MEN.

396
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,100
NOT EVERY PAKISTANI GIRL
WHO DISOBEYS HER FATHER

397
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,800
IS MURDERED, AM I CORRECT?

398
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,600
   THERE ARE LUCKY ONES.

399
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,900
  BUT SOME FATHERS ARE MORE
CONTROLLING, LIKE MY FATHER.

400
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,600
YOUR FATHER ALLOWED YOU
TO COME HERE AND STUDY.

401
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,400
   THAT DOESN'T SOUND PARTICULARLY CONTROLLING.

402
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,600
 -HAS HE EVER LAID A HAND AGAINST YOU?
-NO

403
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,800
-THREATENED YOU?
-NO.

404
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,400
BUT YET YOU THINK HE WOULD KILL YOU

405
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,600
IF YOU RETURN TO YOUR COUNTRY.
DO YOU HAVE ANY PROOF?

406
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,200
   NO, I... I DON'T.

407
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,700
   SO WE ARE TO JUST TAKE YOUR WORD--

408
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,800
THE WORD OF A WOMAN WHO STOOD IN FRONT OF ANOTHER JUDGE

409
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,100
AND PROMISED  TO LOVE, HONOR AND CHERISH

410
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,200
TILL DEATH DO YOU PART
  A <i>GAY</i> MAN?

411
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,200
OBJECTION.

412
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,700
NOTHING FURTHER.

413
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,900
YOU REALIZE THIS   COULD ALL BE BULL, RIGHT?

414
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,800
 LIKE "BECOME A U.S. CITIZEN FOR DUMMIES"--

415
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,600
WHEN MARRYING  YOUR GAY BEST FRIEND FAILS,

416
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,000
  CRY HONOR KILLING. 

417
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,300
GEE, MATT, CYNICAL MUCH?

418
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,200
I'M JUST SAYING CLIENTS LIE, EVEN YOUR CLIENTS.

419
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,400
GOOD NEWS.

420
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,600
11 LEGAL SECRETARIES, 6 PARALEGALS

421
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,300
AND FIVE CLERKS--THEY ALL SIGNED TO STAY ON WITH US.

422
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,500
THAT'S NEARLY EVERYONE.
NOW ALL YOU HAVE TO DO

423
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,600
IS CONVINCE JORDAN TO UNFREEZE
THEIR RAISES FOR THE NEXT YEAR.

424
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,200
   IT'S AMAZING THAT YOU   CONVINCED THEM, BUT AS OF NOW

425
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,800
THERE ARE TEN AND A HALF
 ACTUAL LAWYERS STAYING.

426
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,400
SO HOW CAN I JUSTIFY  KEEPING 22 STAFF

427
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,800
 WITH OR WITHOUT RAISES?

428
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,700
CAN YOU JUSTIFY LETTING THEM GO?

429
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,100
   THE FIRM IS SPLITTING IN TWO.

430
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,800
WHICH IS WHAT I MIGHT DO
TO YOU IN A FEW SECONDS.

431
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,300
I PUT MY ASS ON THE LINE. 

432
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,500
IF YOU DON'T COME UP WITH THAT MONEY,

433
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,300
   WE'RE GONNA LOSE EVERY ASSISTANT, EVERY PARALEGAL--

434
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,900
PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE
IN THIS PLACE WILL STAY.

435
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,000
THIS IS THE REAL WORLD.
PEOPLE HAVE OBLIGATIONS.

436
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
  I REALIZE THAT,
  BUT MY HANDS ARE TIED.

437
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,600
YOUR HANDS ARE TIED?

438
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,700
LISTEN TO YOUELF.

439
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,600
YOU SOUND LIKE POSNER.

440
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,000
 IS THAT THE KIND OF BOSS YOU WANNA BE?

441
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,100
 IF SO, MAYBE THEY ALL <i>SHOULD</i> LEAVE.

442
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,100
 PATTI, COME ON. I'M TRYING.

443
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,100
DON'T "COME ON" ME!

444
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,700
I AM GOING TO TAKE A RIDICULOUSLY LONG LUNCH.

445
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,600
YOU CAN ANSWER YOUR OWN
DAMN PHONES. 

446
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,000
GOODNESS GRACIOUS.

447
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,800
   WHAT MY COUSIN DID IS UNFORGIVABLE.

448
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,000
   I SHOULD NOT EVEN BE HERE.

449
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,500
THEN WHY <i>ARE</i> YOU?

450
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,900
  SANA TOLD US  THAT YOU TWO WERE VERY CLOSE

451
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,900
  WHEN SHE FIRST ARRIVED HERE,

452
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,700
   AND THEN ONE DAY YOU JUST
  STOPPED RETURNING HER CALLS.

453
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,900
WHY?

454
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,900
 I LOVE SANA, OKAY?

455
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,000
   BUT I COULD NOT WATCH HER
BECOME A WESTERN WOMAN.

456
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,200
 YOU'RE WEARING J. CREW AND NIKE.

457
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,100
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE YOU HAVE MUCH
 PROBLEM WITH WESTERNIZATION.

458
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,200
   MY FAMILY EXPECTED ME TO LOOK OUT FOR HER.

459
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,400
AND YOU GOT TIRED  OF BEING A SPY.

460
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,600
  LOOK, THIS IS THE WAY IT'S BEEN FOR CENTURIES.

461
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,900
SANA'S FATHER WAS DISGCED. 

462
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,900
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
  HOPAINFUL IT IS FOR A MAN TO LOSE HIS HONOR?

463
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,900
WELL, MAYBE THERE'S A WAY THAT,    UH, YOU COULD HELP

464
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,500
WITHOUT ANYONE KNOWING.

465
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,400
 MAYBE THERE'S A LETTER
  OR AN E-MAIL

466
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,100
 FROM SANA'S FATHER INTIMATING
 HIS PLAN TO HARM HER.

467
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,100
 YOU'RE ASKING ME  TO SACRIFICE MY HONOR.

468
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,700
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND THAT

469
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,000
   SOME PEOPLE ARE VERY STRICT
  ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMS,

470
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,500
 BUT YOU'VE LIVED HERE  LONG ENOUGH

471
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,000
 TO SEE THINGS A DIFFERENT WAY.

472
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,200
CAN YOU TELL ME  THAT YOU STILL BELIEVE THAT

473
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,500
BECAUSE A WOMAN  LOOKS AT A MAN THE WRONG WAY

474
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,000
  OR REFUSES TO MARRY SOMEONE  CHOSEN BY HER FATHER

475
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,800
   THAT SHE SHOULD BE KILLED?

476
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,500
   YOU HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT
 BECAUSE YOUR COUSIN IS A WOMAN

477
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,900
 THAT SHE SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED
 TO DECIDE FOR HERSELF   WHO E LOVES OR MARRIES?

478
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,500
   SHE'S LIVING HER OWN LIFE
 IN THIS COUNTRY JUST LIKE YOU.

479
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,000
 SHOULD SHE HAVE TO DIE
BECAUSE OF THAT?

480
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,800
AND CAN YOU JUST  STAND BY AND WATCH?

481
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,300
  SO WHAT ABOUT YOUR... HONOR?

482
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,900
   OKAY, I'LL ADMIT IT.
  I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D TURN HIM.

483
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,800
HOW'S IT FEEL WORKING ON A CASE
 YOU'RE ACTUALLY INVESTED IN?

484
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,100
DON'T GET AHEAD OF YOURSELF.

485
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,300
   I'M STILL VERY INVESTED
 IN KEEPING UP MY MEMBERSHIP    AT PEBBLE BEACH.

486
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,100
ADMIT IT, DOWD. YOU'RE HOOKED.

487
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,300
  OH, COME ON. AGAIN?!

488
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,700
SCOTT?

489
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,600
 WHAT IS IT  WITH THESE TWO AND THE SHOWER?

490
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,400
ARE YOU COMING IN HERE?
 I'M ALL LATHERED UP.

491
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,800
  NO, I'M JUST GONNA G   UH..:

492
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,300
 TO THE BEDROOM    AND--AND--AND GET DRESSED

493
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,000
WITH THE DOOR CLOSED AND LOCKED, MAG...

494
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,200
..NIFICENT WOMAN   WHO IS NOT MAGGIE.

495
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,200
COME ON.

496
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,900
WE DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME
BEFORE YOU'RE A MARRIED MAN.

497
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,600
WE NEED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE.

498
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,900
   WE KNOW EACH OTHER...

499
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,600
 INTIMATELY?

500
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,100
 OH, GOD. YOU'RE FREAKING OUT AGAIN.

501
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,600
ARE YOU GONNA END THINGS AGAIN? 

502
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,700
  SHOCKER.

503
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,500
   WHAT IS THAT, THE FOURTH TIME THIS MONTH?

504
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,200
SORRY, NO TIME TODAY.
GET YOUR BT IN HERE.

505
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,000
?

506
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,600
?THERE--

507
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,800
SANA'S FATHER ASKING AMIR TO JOIN HIS COUSINS
IN DEFENDING HIS HONOR.

508
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,000
AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

509
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,400
IT'S VAGUE AT BEST, HEARSAY,

510
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,700
AND THERE'S NO WAY TO
AUTHENTICATE THAT THIS LETTER ACTUALLY CAME FROM SANA'S FATHER.

511
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,200
IT'S A DEATH SENTENCE,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

512
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,200
YOUR CLIENT BROKE THE LAW, AND DESPITE THIS LETTER,

513
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,000
I AM OBLIGATED
TO HAVE HER REMOVED.

514
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,800
WERE YOU BORN WITHOUT THE COMPASSION GENE OR SOMETHING?

515
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,400
HOMELAND SECURITY DOESN'T PAY ME FOR MY COMPASSION.

516
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,700
THEN WE'LL TAKE THE LETTER TO JUDGE KETTLEMAN.

517
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,900
I THINK HE'LL BE INCLINED TO SAVE HER LIFE.

518
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,000
 HMM. SEE, I THINK HE'LL BE
NCLINED TO ENFORCE THE LAW,

519
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,200
HIM BEING A JUDGE AND ALL.

520
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,400
WHICH IS WHY HE WILL NOT SEND A YOUNG WOMAN

521
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,500
TO HER OWN LYNCHING.

522
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,100
I AM WILLING TO CUT YOUR CLIENT A DEAL.

523
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,300
BUT IT IS THE ONLY DEAL I'LL PUT ON THE TABLE.

524
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,600
IT'S INSIDIOUS.

525
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,100
WE'RE OBLIGATED TO PRESENT IT,

526
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,200
BUT THE OFFER SUCKS.

527
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,000
IF I GO BACK TO PAKISTAN,

528
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,400
THEY'LL HAVE ALL CHARGES
aGAINST CARTER DROPPED?

529
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,800
-I'M JUST AS GUILTY AS SHE IS.
-YOU'RE AN AMERICAN.

530
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,400
BOOKER'S A BUREAUCRATIC HACK.

531
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,300
IF SANA ACCEPTS,

532
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,200
SHE CAN TELL HER BOSS
SHE SENT ANOTHER ONE BACK.

533
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,300
IT'S ANOTHER VICTORY FOR NATIONAL SECURITY.

534
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,800
 WELL, DON'T WORRY. SHE WON'T ACCEPT.

535
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,400
WHAT WILL BOOKER DO IF I DON'T?

536
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,400
THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

537
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,800
THEY'LL PRESS FORWARD WITH THEIR
CASES AGAINST YOU AND CARTER.

538
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,400
BUT, SANA, WE CAN WIN THIS.

539
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,300
YOU CANNOT TAKE THIS OFFER.

540
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,500
I'VE ALREADY GOTTEN YOU
IN SO MUCH TROUBLE.

541
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,700
I CAN'T LIVE WITH THE CHANCE
YOU'LL GO TO JAIL. 

542
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,500
OH, YES, YOU CAN.

543
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,300
I DIDN'T SPEND THE LAST TWO YEARS EXPLAINING
TO EVERY SINGLE DATE I BROUGHT HOME

544
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,500
WHY THERE WERE BRAS HANGING IN
THE BATHROOM SO YOU COULD BAIL.

545
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,800
I LOVE YOU. 

546
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,900
I DID THIS TO SAVE YOUR LIFE.

547
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,900
AND NOW I WANT TO SAVE YOURS.

548
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,400
YOU CAN'T GO BACK THERE.

549
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,100
I SEE NO OTHER CHOICE.

550
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,600
I'M TAKING THE DEAL.

551
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,900
POOR MAGGIE.

552
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,000
NO ONE IS HERE.

553
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,400
MATT?

554
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,200
SORRY.

555
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,400
 <i>YOU'RE</i> BARELY EVEN HERE TONIGHT.

556
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,000
IS IT THE CASE?

557
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,400
I JUST CAN'T STOP THINKING,

558
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,400
WISHING THERE WAS SOME WAY
I COULD STOP SANA FROM TAKING THIS DEAL.

559
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,100
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU GET
THIS UPSET OVER WORK BEFORE.

560
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,400
NOT SURE I'VE <i>BEEN</i> THIS UPSET BEFORE.

561
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,500
I'M SORRY.

562
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,500
IT IS NICE TO SEE YOU CARING
SO MUCH ABOUT A CLIENT, THOUGH.

563
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,800
WHAT?

564
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,400
SUBTLENESS ISN'T EXACTLY YOUR FORTE.

565
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,400
THINK I DON'T KNOW
YOU HAD STONE SET ME UP?

566
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,200
YOU COULD HAVE JUST PASSED ME
A NOTE ASKING IF I WAS STAYING

567
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,500
WITH BOXES FOR YES OR NO AND "I"
DOTTED WITH A LITTLE HEART.

568
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,600
OKAY.

569
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,300
IT WAS IMMATURE. I JUST--

570
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,800
I DIDN'T WANT TO PRESSURE YOU.

571
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,800
COUPLES HAVE SURVIVED WORKING
AT DIFFERENT FIRMS BEFORE.

572
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,200
I JUST...

573
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,600
THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH STRESS
A RELATIONSHIP CAN TAKE.

574
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,100
NO PRESSURE THERE.

575
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,600
YOU'RE RIGHT.I'M NOT GONNA ASK YOU TO STAY.

576
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,500
GOOD.

577
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,300
'CAUSE, TAYLOR, YOU MEAN SO MUCH TO ME.

578
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,400
IF YOU HAD ASKED ME, THERE'S NO WAY I COULD HAVE SAID...

579
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,500
NO.

580
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,800
WHY ARE YOU SMILING?

581
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,700
I THINK I JUST FIGURED OUT A WAY
TO GET SANA TO CHANGE HER MIND.

582
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,000
THE OTHER THING ABOUT MOJITOS IS
THEY MAKE YOU FEEL ALL BETTER,

583
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,900
LIKE A TROPICAL BEACH PARTY IN YOUR MOUTH.

584
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,500
I MEAN, LOOK AT ME.

585
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,000
I'M HAVING A <i>GREAT</i> TIME.

586
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,200
ARE YOU SURE?

587
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,600
'CAUSE YOU'RE SITTING
OVER HERE ALL ON YOUR OWN.

588
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,600
IT'S A DISASTER.

589
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,100
IT'S JUST BAD TIMING.

590
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,000
doT TAKE IT PERSONALLY.

591
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,800
ELI, IT'S MY <i>ENGAGEMENT PARTY.</i>

592
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,600
IT SHOULD BE...

593
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,000
SHOULD <i>FEEL</i> DIFFERENT.

594
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,200
LIKE ALL THESE PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T
SHOW UP KNEW WHAT I DIDN'T.

595
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,400
SCOTT AND I HAD A HUGE BLOWUP THIS MORNING.

596
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,000
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHY I TURNED DOWN POSNER.

597
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,200
 POOR GUY.

598
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:11,000
HE'S SO WORRIED AND CONCERNED
ABOUT OUR FUTURE.

599
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,700
HE'S SO GOOD TO ME.

600
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,500
AND I...

601
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,900
I CAN NEVER HURT HIM.

602
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,000
MAGGIE, I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

603
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,100
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE HUNGRY.
BROUGHT YOU A PLATE--SUSHI.

604
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,300
OH, NO, THANKS.

605
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,700
A LOVELY BRIE.

606
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,800
I'M OKAY.

607
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,600
-CHAMPAGNE?
-NO.

608
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,300
HOW ABOUT THIS EMMENTALER?

609
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,400
HAVE YOU TASTED THIS? COME ON.

610
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,000
YOU'RE PREGNANT.

611
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,000
I KNEW IT.

612
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,300
YOUR MOTHER HAD A THING FOR EMMENTALER

613
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,500
WHEN SHE WAS PREGNANT, TOO.

614
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,000
ok COLUMBO, YOU GOT ME.

615
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,700
PLEASE DON'T SAY ANYTHING TO ANYONE. MATT DOESN'T EVEN KNOW.

616
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:01,100
OF COURSE NOT. THAT'S COMPLICATED. I UNDERSTAND.

617
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,100
YOU COULD HAVE TOLD <i>ME,</i> THOUGH.

618
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,500
I'M SORRY.

619
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,500
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

620
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,100
PRETTY OVERWHELMED, TO BE HONEST.

621
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,400
IT'S A LOT TO THINK ABOUT--A BABY.

622
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,300
I NEVER REALLY SAW MYSELF AS A MOTHER.

623
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,600
I'M NOT SURE I DO NOW.

624
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,800
I SEE.

625
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,300
SO YOU MIGHT NOT BE KEEPING IT?

626
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,200
I'M SORRY IF THAT'S NOT
WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR, DAD.

627
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,000
I MEAN, THINGS WITH MATT AND I ARE GOOD,

628
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,400
BUT WE'RE NOT EXACTLY SERIOUS.

629
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,000
CAN I RAISE A BABY ON MY OWN?

630
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,400
I MEAN, WOULD I EVEN WANT TO? 

631
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,900
SWEETIE, THE DECISION IS YOURS, OF COURSE.

632
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,500
BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW,

633
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,800
YOU ARE NEVER ALONE.

634
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,300
 THANKS, DAD.

635
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,700
WELL, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.Y-YOU WERE IN MY BATHROOM?

636
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,900
WELL, YEAH. I WAS IN YOUR SHOWER FIRST.

637
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,700
UH, IT'S-- IT'S, UH, VERY NICE.

638
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,800
IT'S A GREAT SELECTION OF SHAMPOO. 

639
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,800
IT'S A LITTLE GIRLY FOR MY TASTE, BUT, UH--

640
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,100
BUT WHAT WERE YOU DOING IN THERE?

641
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,700
) YOU SEE, THE THINGS IS, UM...

642
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,800
I WASN'T... ME,

643
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,900
AND, UM, I WASN'T...

644
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,600
ALONE.

645
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,500
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

646
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,600
MAGGIE, I WAS--

647
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,200
-SCOTT! 
-THERE YOU ARE.

648
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,500
HI, HONEY.

649
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,100
 SHOULD'VE FIGURED WHEN I
COULDN'T FIND HER ANYWHERE,

650
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,500
SHE'D BE HERE WITH YOU.

651
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,000
MAGGIE, YOUR PARENTS
ARE LOOKING ALL OVER FOR YOU.

652
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,600
PARENTS. I BETTER GO.

653
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,300
I'M ONLY GONNA SAY THIS ONCE. BACK OFF.

654
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,200
LOOK, WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.
WHY CAN'T YOU RESPECT THAT?

655
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,300
WHY CAN'T <i>YOU?</i>

656
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,800
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

657
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,700
IT MEANS I SAW YOU

658
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:52,000
WITH A CERTAIN, UH, NAKED MARRIED WOMAN.

659
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,800
WHY DON'T YOU MIND
YOUR OWN BUSINESS, BRO?

660
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,600
WHY DON'T YOU TELL HER, <i>BRO,</i>

661
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,500
BEFORE I DO?

662
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,600
BEFORE SHE MAKES THE BIGGEST MISTAKE OF HER LIFE

663
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,700
AND MARRIES A PIECE OF CRAP LIKE--

664
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,300
ELI! WHAT-- WHAT'S GOING ON?

665
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,900
JUST... GO TELL HER.
YOU TELL HER, OR I WILL.

666
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,200
GO CLEAN UP YOUR FACE. WE'LL TALK LATER.

667
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,500
AND YOU...

668
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,300
PLEASE LEAVE.

669
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,600
now

670
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,300
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE   SO EARLY?

671
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,900
IS IT CARTER? WILL?

672
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,600
 NO, NO,  IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT.

673
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,600
 LOOK,   YOU CAN'T TAKE THIS DEAL.

674
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,400
CARTER DOESN'T NEED    YOUR SACRIFICE. 

675
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,200
HE NEEDS YOU.

676
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,900
   GOING TO JAIL WOULD DESTROY HIM.

677
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,700
LIVING WITH THE GUILT OF YOU
 DYING WOULD DESTROY HIM...

678
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,000
NOT TO MENTION WILL.

679
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:14,100
WILL'S A STRONG MAN.   HE'LL BE FINE.

680
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,900
 TELL HIM THAT.

681
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,900
  ALL RIGHT, STEP IN, PLEASE.

682
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,900
 SANA, TELL WILL EXACTLY
HOW HE'LL BE FINE

683
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,700
 LIVING THE REST OF HIS LIFE

684
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,300
   NOT KNOWING WHETHER THE WOMAN
 HE LOVES IS ALIVE OR DEAD.

685
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,200
   AND, WILL, YOU TELL SANA
  EXACTLY HOW YOU AND CARTER

686
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,300
   WILL BE ABLE TO GO ON WITHOUT HER,

687
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,600
 THAT A DAY WILL COME
  WHEN YOU TWO WON'T WAKE UP

688
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,100
 THINKING ABOUT HER,

689
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,300
  WONDERING,

690
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,600
  HATING YOURSELVES.

691
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,500
IF YOU TWO CAN ACTUALLY CONVINCE
   EACH OTHER OF THOSE THINGS,

692
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,800
  THEN, SANA,   YOU SHOULD TAKE THIS DEAL.

693
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:59,700
  BUT MY GUESS IS YOU WON'T.

694
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,100
MY GUESS IS YOU'LL STAY.

695
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,400
  YOU'LL STAY   FOR THE MEN WHO LOVE YOU.

696
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,200
SANA MADE SOME MISTAKES,

697
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,200
  BUT THE QUESTION BEFORE YOU,  YOUR HONOR,

698
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,500
   IS WHETHER THOSE MISTAKES
 JUSTIFY PUTTING HER TO DEATH.

699
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,300
THAT'S WHAT SENDING HER  TO PAKISTAN WILL DO.

700
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,900
 THE LETTER FROM SANA'S FATHER
   TO HER COUSIN PROVES THAT.

701
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:30,100
 MS. BOOKER CALLS THE MARRIAGE
BETWEEN SANA AND CARTER  FRAUDULENT,

702
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:34,600
 YET SANA WAS WILLING TO RETURN
   TO PAKISTAN AND FACE DEATH

703
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,000
  FOR CARTER.

704
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,400
THAT...

705
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,300
   THAT IS SACRIFICE

706
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,700
  AND A LOVE MORE REAL

707
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,900
 THAN WHAT'S BETWEEN
  MOST MARRIED COUPLES I KNOW.

708
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,500
I'LL SAVE YOU   ALL THE SUSPENSE.

709
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,300
 MISS KHAN HAS NOT DEMONSTRATED
 RESPECT FOR OUR LAWS.

710
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,800
SHE KNOWINGLY ENTERED
   INTO A FRAUDULENT MARRIAGE

711
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,700
   IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A GREEN CARD.

712
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,500
I CANNOT REWARD   NOR CONDONE THIS BEHAVIOR,

713
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,800
   AND I CANNOT EXTEND TO HER
 THE PRIVILEGE  OF U.S. CITIZENSHIP.

714
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,400
I AM CONVINCED, HOWEVER,

715
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,500
 THAT MS. KHAN WOULD BE
IN GRAVE DANGER   IF SHE RETURNS TO PAKISTAN.

716
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,700
 I THEREFORE GRANT THE WITHHOLDING OF HER REMOVAL.

717
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,400
   SHE'LL BE ALLOWED TO REMAIN HERE

718
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,900
  AS LONG AS THERE IS  A THREAT AGAINST HER.

719
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,400
 SORRYTHINGS DIDN'T WORK OUT.

720
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,900
  WE'LL SEE HOW SMUG   YOU ARE TOMOOW.

721
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,500
   WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?


722
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,800
YOU PUSHED ME TOO FAR.

723
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,300
   I SPOKE TO MY SUPERVISOR,  CANDACE BONNEVILLE,

724
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,900
   TOLD HER ABOUT OUR LITTLE GREEN CARD SITUATION.

725
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,300
RECOMMENDED TH SHE EXPEDITE PROCEEDINGS
 TO GET CARTER THE MAXIMUM-

726
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,300
 FIVE YEARS.

727
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,200
 WHAT? NO.

728
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,300
 WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

729
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,000
 WHY WOULD YOU THINK

730
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,200
   I'M SO SORRY 

731
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,500
FOR MYEHAVIOR...

732
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,600
FOR EVERYTHING.

733
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,300
  YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO
FIND OUT ABOUT SCOTT THAT WAY.

734
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,500
 ARE THINGS, UH... HOW--HOW ARE THINGS?

735
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,200
   THE ENGAGEMENT'S OFF.

736
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,200
 THE WEDDING'S OFF.

737
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,700
IT'S ALL... OFF.

738
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,200
  IT'S FOR THE BEST.

739
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,800
IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT I CAN DO...

740
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,200
IF YOU WANT ME TO PUNCH HIM   AGAIN, I WILL.

741
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,700
I'M A GIVER THAT WAY.

742
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,700
  HE'S NOT ENTIRELY  TO BLAME, YOU KNOW.

743
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,600
 HE HAD GOOD REASON.

744
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,000
   SCOTT'S NO DUMMY.

745
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,100
HE KNEW.

746
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,600
  HE KNEW IT  BEFORE I EVEN DID.

747
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,100
  I WAS COMING HOME EVERY NIGHT,
TALKING ABOUT WORK,

748
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,300
  WHAT YOU HAD DONE IN COURT
   OR WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT.

749
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:00,800
-MAGGIE--
-   YEAH, I THINK HE PROPOSED TO GET ME TO FORGET YOU.

750
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,900
 I THINK I ACCEPTED FOR THE SAME REASON.

751
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,200
 I KNEW.

752
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,900
  I KNEW YOU DIDN'T FEEL  THE SAME WAY AS I DID.

753
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,700
-I WISH--
-  YOU DON'T.

754
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,800
  I GET IT, ELI.

755
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,700
ANYWAYS,

756
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,800
TURNS OUT SCOTT WASN'T THE SAINT
I THOUGHT HE WAS, WAS HE?

757
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,500
HE AND CANDACE HAVE BEEN   GETTING IT ON FOR MONTHS.

758
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,900
CANDACE?

759
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,400
   LUCKY I WASN'T ON YOUR
GREEN CARD CASE, BY THE WAY

760
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,200
TURNS OUT SHE'S BOOKER'S
  TEAM LEADER AT I.C.E.

761
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,500
 TALK ABOUT   CONFLICT OF INTEREST.

762
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,700
YOU'RE KIDDING.

763
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,900
I HAVE YOUR BOXES,   MISS DEKKER.

764
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,100
OH, COULD YOU PLEASE PUT THEM BY MY DESK?

765
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,900
  SO YOU'RE... FINALLY
GETTING YOUR OWN OFFICE?

766
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,800
WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE SHORT ON SPACE ANYMORE.

767
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,100
 I CAN'T STAY HERE, ELI.

768
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:10,200
 I CAN'T  LET MY FEELINGS FOR YOU

769
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,400
   COST ME MORE THAN   THEY ALREADY HAVE.

770
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,100
NOT POSNER & KLEIN.

771
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,400
DON'T DO THAT.

772
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,800
YOU--YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

773
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,200
 I DO.

774
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,100
I LOVE YOU, ELI.

775
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,900
 BUT FOR ONCE...

776
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,800
   I'M ACTUALLY GONNA PUT MYSELF FIRST.

777
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,400
MISS BONNEVILLE?

778
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,100
HI. 

779
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,900
I'M ELI STONE.

780
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,500
 HI.

781
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,800
 YOU'RE REPRESENTING  CARTER JAMESON, RIGHT?

782
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,600
I, UH, PULLED HIS FOLDER
   AFTER I GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

783
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,300
 YOU MUST HAVE REALLY PISSED
CHARLOTTE BOOKER OFF.

784
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,000
 I GET THE FEELING
SHE'S A BIT OF A SORE LOSER.

785
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,600
SHE'S PASSIONATE ABOUT HER WORK.

786
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,800
 BUT YOU'RE HER BOSS,  AND, UH,

787
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,900
I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT

788
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,400
THIS OFFICE HAS HANDLED   DOZENS OF CASES EXACTLY

789
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,500
LIKE CARTER'S WHERE YOU HAVE SIGNED OFF ON DEALS 

790
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,200
WHICH
INVOLVED ZERO PRISON TIME.

791
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,500
  I'M SORRY, MR. STONE, BUT THIS
ISN'T GONNA BE ONE OF THEM.

792
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,900
   I HAVE TO ACCEPT CHARLOTTE'S RECOMMENDATION.

793
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,800
  MY PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW THAT I TRUST THEM.

794
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,700
   I FEEL AWFUL
PLAYING THIS CARD,

795
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:34,200
BUT, UM, CONSIDERING
WHO DEALT IT TO ME,

796
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,300
 I DON'T SEE HOW
I HAVE ANY CHOICE.

797
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,200
 I KNOW ABOUT YOUR...

798
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,600
EXTRAMARITAL ACTIVITIES
WITH SCOTT CLAUSON.

799
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,300
 PARDON ME?

800
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,500
I KNOW IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS,

801
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,300
  BUT I WAS...

802
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,800
   I THINK I WAS MEANT
TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR AFFAIR

803
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,400
SO THAT I MIGHT ENCOURAGE YOU  TO HELP MY CLIENT.

804
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,900
ARE YOU BLACKMAILING ME?

805
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,600
   NO. I AM JUST STRONGLY SUGGESTING

806
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,200
 THAT THERE IS A SOLUTION
OPPOSITE TO MS. BOOKER'S...

807
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:09,000
 WHICH YOU SHOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER.

808
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,500
UPON FURTHER EXAMINATION   OF HIS FILE,

809
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,500
 I DO SEE SOME   AMELIORATING FACTORS HERE.

810
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,100
  500 HOURS OF COMMUNITY SERVICE
  AN2 YEARS PROBATION.

811
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,800
SOUNDS LIKE WE HAVE A DEAL.

812
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,400
SURELY YOU JEST, MS. DEKKER.

813
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,700
   OUR OFFER OF LEGAL EMPLOYMENT
IS STRICTLY NONNEGOTIABLE.

814
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,100
NOTHING'S NONNEGOTIABLE,  MR. POSNER,

815
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,000
NOT WHEN BOTH PARTIES   HAVE LEVERAGE.

816
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,900
I'M WELL AWARE OF MY UNIQUE
VALUE TO YOU AND MS. KLEIN.

817
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,200
  PRAY TELL, MS. DEKKER.

818
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,800
 YOU RELISH THE THOUGHT OF HOW
MUCH YOU <i>THINK</i> IT WILL HURT ELI

819
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,200
IF I GO WORK FOR YOU.

820
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,000
 DO YOU REALLY HAVE THAT LOW
  AN OPINION OF ME?

821
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,300
LOWER, ACTUALLY.

822
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,200
  AND YET YOU'RE WILLING   TO WORK FOR ME

823
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,600
   IF I MEET YOUR TERMS.

824
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,200
   IF I CAN USE YOU TO HELP
THE PEOPLE I WANT TO HELP, 

825
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,300
YES.

826
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,900
THESE ARE MY TERMS.

827
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,900
TAKE THEM OR LEAVE THEM.

828
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,200
  VERY SAVVY ASKS...

829
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,500
  T WE CAN LIVE WITH THEM.

830
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,700
  WELCOME TO POSNER & KLEIN.

831
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,100
   I SUSPECT WE'RE GOING  TO DISCOVER STILL MORE

832
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,500
  HIDDEN DEPTHS IN YOU, MS. DEKKER.

833
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,600
THE PROSECUTION IS GIVING CARTER A PASS.

834
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,700
I KNOW. SANA JUST CALLED   TO THANK ME.

835
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,800
  HOW DID YOU DO IT?

836
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,200
FRIENDS IN HIGH PLACES.

837
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:47,900
  YEAH. 

838
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,700
WE DID GOOD.

839
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,700
WE DID. SO WHY ARE YOU PACKING?

840
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,500
  WHAT WE DID THIS WEEK,

841
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 I HAVE NEVER FELT SO...

842
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,400
  GRATIFIED,

843
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,100
   SO RELIEVED BY A WIN.

844
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,800
WHICH MEANS THAT TAYLOR'S
?HALF-BAKED PLAN WORKED

845
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,800
AND YOU'RE SUPPOSED   TO STAY NOW.

846
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,600
  STONE, 

847
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,000
I HAVEN'T SLEPT  IN THREE DAYS.

848
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,400
 I'VE BEEN WEARING THE SAME   STINKIN' SHIRT SINCE TUESDAY,

849
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,800
AND I HAVEN'T SWEAT THIS BAD

850
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,000
SINCE I RAN   THE BAY TO BREAKERS MARATHON.

851
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,200
THAT'S BECAUSE THE CASE MATTERED TO YOU, MATT.

852
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,600
THAT'S WHAT IT FEELS LIKE.

853
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,100
THAT'S EXACTLY MY POINT.

854
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,000
I LIKE A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP,

855
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,400
AND THE ONLY OCCASION

856
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,600
  WHERE I ENJOY SWEATING
 ISN'T IN THE COURTROOM.

857
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,200
NAH. THIS ISN'T ME, ELI.

858
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,200
YOU SAVED SANA'S LIFE.

859
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,800
 YEAH,   AND IT NEARLY ENDED MINE.

860
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,800
I DON'T KNOW HOW I WOULD HAVE LIVED WITH MYSELF
  IF WE'D LOST THAT.

861
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,500
LISTEN, MAN,  

862
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,200
I ADMIRE WHAT YOU DO.

863
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,300
IT'S JUST NOT WHAT I DO.

864
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
WHAT ABOUT TAYLOR?

865
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,900
 SHE'LL BE FINE.

866
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,200
   YOU SHOULD BE WORRIED  ABOUT YOURSELF.

867
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,400
WHY?

868
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,400
  BECAUSE THE NEXT TIME
WE'RE IN COURT TOGETHER,

869
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,200
 IT'LL BE MY JOB  TO SHRED YOU.

870
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,700
I'M SORRY.

871
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,200
DON'T BE.

872
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,200
  YOU MADE YOUR OWN DECISION.
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED YOU TO DO.

873
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,400
PLEASE DON'T  TAKE IT PERSONALLY.


874
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,500
 YOU SAW WHAT THIS TRIAL DID TO ME.

875
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,800
 I JUST... I DON'T DO EMOTIONAL,

876
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,200
TAYLOR. YOU KNOW THAT.

877
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,800
I DO.

878
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,800
ANYWAY,

879
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,000
 THINK HOW MUCH  MORE FUN SEEING EACH OTHER

880
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,600
   AT NIGHT'S GONNA BE WHEN WE HAVEN'T SEEN EACH OTHER ALL DAY.

881
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,400
I MADE RESERVATIONS   AT MASA'S.

882
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,800
 8:00 OKAY?

883
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,900
GREAT.

884
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,600
   HI.

885
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,100
HELLO.

886
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,800
 SO RUMOR HAS IT    

887
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,600
THAT POSNER MADE EVERY MEMBER
  OF STAFF HERE AN OFFER,

888
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,300
  INCLUDING YOU.

889
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,500
JUST SO YOU KNOW, UM,

890
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,100
OUT OF ALL THE PEOPLE HERE,

891
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,100
YOU'RE THE ONE  I COULD NEVER LOSE. 

892
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,100
 I MEAN THAT, PATTI.

893
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:22,200
  WELL, I MEAN, LORD KNOWS
YOU'D BE USELESS WITHOUT ME.

894
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,500
  LOOKS LIKE, UH, YOU'RE  NOT THE ONLY ONE, TOO.

895
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,500
 I SAW JOHN IN THE ELEVATOR,
BETTY IN THE KITCHEN.

896
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,400
  WHATEVER YOU SAID TO THEM   MUST HAVE WORKED.

897
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,900
 I GUESS WE GOT A LOT
OF SAPPY IDEALISTS AROUND HERE.

898
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,300
 I GUESS.

899
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,900
 WELL, YOU CAN TELL THOSE SAPPY IDEALISTS
  WHO STAYED ON THAT 

900
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,400
WE WILL  UNFREEZE THEIR RAISES  FOR NEXT YEAR. 

901
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,200
. YEAH, IT'S NOT  AS MUCH AS WHAT POSNER OFFERED,

902
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,700
AND IT'S NOT   WHAT YOU ALL DESERVE,

903
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,800
  BUT WE'RE GONNA DO WHAT WE CAN.

904
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,900
  I'LL TAKE IT OUT OF MY OWN
 SALARY IF I HAVE TO.

905
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,200
REALLY, ELI?

906
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,900
 THIS IS A NEW FIRM, PATTI,

907
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,900
 AND WE MAY HAVE TO IMPROVISE,

908
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,000
BUT WE'RE GONNA FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO BE THE BEST FIRM THAT WE CAN.

909
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,600
NOW IF YOU WOULD BE SO KIND,

910
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,500
MAY I HAVE MY WACKADOO FILE?

911
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,900
OF COURSE.

912
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,600
 JUST THE MAN   I WAS LOOKING FOR.

913
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:16,000
I TRUST IT WASN'T TOO DIFFICULT TO FIND ME.

914
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,800
OUR RANKS ARE CONSIDERABLY THINNED.

915
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,700
  THINNED...

916
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,900
   BUT STRENGTHENED.

917
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,000
CERTAINLY THERE ARE PLENTY
   OF ETY OFFICES NOW

918
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,800
IF YOU WANT TO MOVE OUT OF THE LIBRARY.

919
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,100
 OH, THANK YOU, SIR,

920
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,900
 BUT, UH, I THINK I'LL STAY.

921
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,000
SENTIMENTAL REASONS,  YOU KNOW?

922
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,400
THAT I DO.

923
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,700
WHAT'S THAT?

924
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,500
 NEW CASES. NEW CLIENTS.

925
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,500
  I WAS JUST BRINGING IT  BY YOUR OFFICE.

926
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,800
 OR WE COULD START FRESH
  TOMORROW IF YOU LIKE.

927
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,300
NO, NO. NOW WOULD BE FINE.

928
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,800
BUT FIRST THERE WAS SOMETHING
I WANTED TO GIVE YOU.

929
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,700
TO NEW BEGINNINGS...

930
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,400
  PARTNER.

931
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,500
 NEW BEGINNINGS.

932
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:17,400
