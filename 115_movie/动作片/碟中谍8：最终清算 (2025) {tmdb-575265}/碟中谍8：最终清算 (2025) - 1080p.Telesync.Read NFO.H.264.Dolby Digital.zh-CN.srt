1
00:00:51,046 --> 00:00:52,220
Ron is down.

2
00:00:53,104 --> 00:00:54,834
He needs a medical evac.

3
00:00:54,905 --> 00:00:56,426
Where is it? Is it there?

4
00:00:56,675 --> 00:00:58,754
- Oh, the drive is gone.
- Are you sure?

5
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:04,607
It's gone.
Give me a minute.

6
00:01:04,633 --> 00:01:06,935
They must have it.
Get off to them.

7
00:01:11,228 --> 00:01:13,960
- I'm stabilizing Ronson.
- We don't have the time.

8
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,164
- I have to stop the bleeding.
- Leave him!

9
00:01:52,744 --> 00:01:53,696
Have you got him?

10
00:01:54,334 --> 00:01:55,984
He is in the black Audi.

11
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,953
- What about Ronson.
- He's been hit.

12
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:00,722
I'm sending an emergency
evacuation squad.

13
00:02:00,953 --> 00:02:03,078
Well, that'll be too bloody late.

14
00:02:03,831 --> 00:02:05,146
Have they seen us?

15
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:09,383
Medical Evac for Ronson,
five minutes way.

16
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:16,921
It's allright?
You'll wait using it.

17
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:22,383
I wasn't using that one either.

18
00:03:06,059 --> 00:03:07,540
Keep your head down!

19
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:43,516
Just get clear!

20
00:03:45,402 --> 00:03:46,805
Tanner, which way?

21
00:03:46,855 --> 00:03:48,793
Keep going.
I can direct you from here.

22
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,111
We both know
what's at stake here.

23
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,284
We can not afford
to lose that list.

24
00:03:52,374 --> 00:03:53,650
Yes, ma'am.

25
00:04:22,872 --> 00:04:24,119
Where are they now?

26
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:27,072
They're on the top roof
of the grand bazaar.

27
00:05:18,648 --> 00:05:21,437
Take the left, there's a bridge.
You can cut him off.

28
00:06:13,188 --> 00:06:15,415
- What happened?
- They're on the train, ma' am.

29
00:06:15,465 --> 00:06:16,378
What do you mean
on the train?

30
00:06:16,403 --> 00:06:17,938
I mean they're on the top
of the train.

31
00:06:17,988 --> 00:06:20,141
Well, get off to them,
for God's sake.

32
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:51,016
He's going out of range.

33
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,588
We've lost tracking.
We are blind here.

34
00:06:52,726 --> 00:06:54,353
- What's going on?
- I'm still with them.

35
00:06:54,476 --> 00:06:56,901
There is CCTV satellite,
end of it.

36
00:07:46,963 --> 00:07:47,930
What was that?

37
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,676
VW Beetles, I think.

38
00:08:17,757 --> 00:08:19,703
He's uncapping the cars.

39
00:08:57,332 --> 00:09:00,967
- 007, are you alright?
- Just changing carriages.

40
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:03,968
What's going on?
Report!

41
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:05,947
It's rather hard
to explain, ma'am.

42
00:09:06,172 --> 00:09:08,505
007 is saying proceed.

43
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:16,313
This side here isn't much more road.
I do not think I can go any further.

44
00:10:51,099 --> 00:10:53,044
I may have a shot.

45
00:10:59,968 --> 00:11:00,859
It's not clean.

46
00:11:01,405 --> 00:11:03,551
Repeat.
I did not have a clean shot.

47
00:11:10,263 --> 00:11:12,417
There's a tunnel ahead.
I'm gonna lose them.

48
00:11:12,613 --> 00:11:15,794
- Can you get into a better position?
- Negative. There's no time.

49
00:11:17,873 --> 00:11:18,850
Take the shot.

50
00:11:20,986 --> 00:11:22,488
I said, "Take the shot!"

51
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:25,810
Well, I can't.
I may get Bond.

52
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,551
Take the bloody shot.

47
00:11:49,463 --> 00:11:50,617
Agent down.

53
00:17:09,878 --> 00:17:12,129
It's like going
into the headmaster study.

54
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:14,381
It's new chairman's 
just a standard procedure.

55
00:17:14,723 --> 00:17:17,081
Bloody waste of my time,
that's what I'd call it.

56
00:17:17,171 --> 00:17:19,009
I'm sorry to have
to deal with such...

57
00:17:19,028 --> 00:17:20,884
a delicate subject
at our first encounter...

58
00:17:23,912 --> 00:17:25,052
But...

59
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:28,138
I have to be frank with you.

60
00:17:28,188 --> 00:17:30,467
And it would be a good idea.

61
00:17:33,002 --> 00:17:34,463
The Prime Minister
is concerned.

62
00:17:35,552 --> 00:17:38,467
You can tell him my operatives
are pursuing every avenue.

63
00:17:38,678 --> 00:17:40,309
Have you considered
pulling up the agents?

64
00:17:40,514 --> 00:17:41,793
I've considered every option.

65
00:17:42,097 --> 00:17:44,062
Forgive me,
but that sounds like an evasion.

66
00:17:44,567 --> 00:17:46,418
Forgive me,
but why am I here?

67
00:17:47,813 --> 00:17:50,385
Three months ago
you lost the computer drive

68
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:53,317
containing the identity
of almost every NATO agent

69
00:17:53,367 --> 00:17:56,710
embedded in terrorist organizations
across the globe.

70
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:59,435
A list which,
in the eyes of our allies,

71
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,703
never existed.

72
00:18:00,753 --> 00:18:04,299
So, if you'll forgive me,
I think you know why you're here.

73
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:06,121
How you should call it,
a civilian oversight?

74
00:18:06,709 --> 00:18:08,255
No, what we call this is...

75
00:18:08,312 --> 00:18:10,426
a retirement planning.

76
00:18:11,646 --> 00:18:13,764
Your country has only
the highest respect for you

77
00:18:13,814 --> 00:18:15,783
and your many years
of service.

78
00:18:15,905 --> 00:18:17,446
When your current posting
is completed,

79
00:18:17,572 --> 00:18:19,827
you'll be awarded to JCMG

80
00:18:19,914 --> 00:18:21,550
with full honors.

81
00:18:22,341 --> 00:18:24,228
Congratulations.

82
00:18:25,097 --> 00:18:26,237
You are firing me?

83
00:18:26,262 --> 00:18:28,380
No, ma'am, I'm here to oversee
the transition period...

84
00:18:28,454 --> 00:18:31,618
leading to your voluntary retirement
in two months' time.

85
00:18:31,843 --> 00:18:34,151
Your successor has yet to be appointed,
so we'll be asking you--

86
00:18:34,325 --> 00:18:36,016
I'm not an idiot, Mallory.

87
00:18:36,934 --> 00:18:38,563
I know I can't do this job
forever.

88
00:18:39,256 --> 00:18:41,065
But I'll be damned if I'm going
to leave the department

89
00:18:41,094 --> 00:18:43,235
in worst shape than I found it.

90
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:46,138
M... you've had a great run.

91
00:18:46,766 --> 00:18:49,552
- You should leave with dignity.
- Go to hell with dignity.

92
00:18:50,168 --> 00:18:53,383
I'll leave when the job's done.

93
00:19:10,422 --> 00:19:11,422
Yes?

94
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:14,729
Now?

95
00:19:16,217 --> 00:19:17,697
Main alert from Q Robson,

96
00:19:17,852 --> 00:19:20,381
trying to decrypt
the stolen hard drive.

97
00:19:20,652 --> 00:19:23,092
We are tracing
the encryption signal.

98
00:19:23,142 --> 00:19:24,704
Localizing now.

99
00:19:27,092 --> 00:19:30,342
It's sent here in the UK.

100
00:19:30,811 --> 00:19:32,230
London.

101
00:19:32,692 --> 00:19:35,058
Get to inspect the basis
as soon as possible.

102
00:19:41,892 --> 00:19:44,057
- It's coming from MI6.
- What?

103
00:19:44,289 --> 00:19:47,092
The data back,
it is linking to our network.

104
00:19:47,127 --> 00:19:49,609
Corrupted.
This is behind our firewall.

105
00:19:49,744 --> 00:19:52,403
- We should shut down.
- No, track it.

106
00:19:52,428 --> 00:19:54,108
We have to know
where it's coming from.

107
00:19:54,837 --> 00:19:56,637
Strip the head
and try the source.

108
00:19:56,687 --> 00:19:58,527
How the hell
it entered in our system?

109
00:19:58,682 --> 00:20:00,736
Get in trace right now.

110
00:20:07,862 --> 00:20:11,300
- It is your computer, ma'am.
- Shut it down.

111
00:20:17,495 --> 00:20:18,814
What is this?

112
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,830
For God's sake!

113
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:44,763
Just get out of the way.

114
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:47,533
- Don't you recognize the car?
- Madam...

115
00:24:12,678 --> 00:24:14,946
I'm gonna find
who ever did this.

116
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:05,682
Where the hell
have you been?

117
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:09,483
Enjoying death.

118
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:13,008
007, reporting for duty.

119
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:21,628
Why didn't you call?

120
00:25:22,203 --> 00:25:23,336
Didn't you get the postcard?

121
00:25:24,443 --> 00:25:25,398
You should try it sometimes.

122
00:25:25,618 --> 00:25:28,331
Get away from it all,
it really lends perspective.

123
00:25:28,588 --> 00:25:31,055
Run out of drink.
Were you awarded, eh?

124
00:25:31,105 --> 00:25:32,146
What it was you said?

125
00:25:32,637 --> 00:25:34,711
Take the bloody shot.

126
00:25:34,761 --> 00:25:36,720
I made a judgement call.

127
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:39,193
You should have trusted me
to finish the job.

128
00:25:39,243 --> 00:25:40,668
It was the possibility
of losing you...

129
00:25:40,758 --> 00:25:43,703
or the certainty of losing
all those other agents.

130
00:25:43,853 --> 00:25:46,632
I made the only decision I could
and you know it.

131
00:25:47,761 --> 00:25:49,036
I think you've lost your nerve.

132
00:25:49,227 --> 00:25:51,444
What do you expect,
a bloody apology?

133
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:54,985
You know the rules of the game.
You've been playing it long enough.

134
00:25:55,478 --> 00:25:58,530
- We both have.
- Maybe too long.

135
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,821
Speak for yourself.

136
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,130
Ronson didn't make it, did he?

137
00:26:06,457 --> 00:26:07,430
No.

138
00:26:10,917 --> 00:26:11,896
So, this is it.

139
00:26:12,782 --> 00:26:14,145
We are both played out.

140
00:26:15,522 --> 00:26:18,034
Well, if you believed that,
why did you come back?

141
00:26:18,289 --> 00:26:19,566
Good question.

142
00:26:21,323 --> 00:26:22,834
Because we are
under attack...

143
00:26:25,043 --> 00:26:27,925
and you know
we need you.

144
00:26:31,358 --> 00:26:32,647
Well, I'm here.

145
00:26:34,408 --> 00:26:35,486
You'll have to be debriefed...

146
00:26:35,578 --> 00:26:37,424
and declared fit
for active service.

147
00:26:38,737 --> 00:26:41,510
You're gonna return to duty
when you've passed the tests.

148
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,750
So take them seriously.

149
00:26:43,853 --> 00:26:45,820
The shower
might be an order.

150
00:26:46,718 --> 00:26:48,846
I'm going home
and change.

151
00:26:48,896 --> 00:26:50,281
Oh, we sold your flat.

152
00:26:51,112 --> 00:26:52,716
Put your things
into storage.

153
00:26:53,589 --> 00:26:54,729
Standard procedure...

154
00:26:54,892 --> 00:26:58,294
on the death of an unmarried
employee with no next of kin.

155
00:26:59,046 --> 00:27:00,824
You should have called.

156
00:27:00,874 --> 00:27:02,442
I'll find a hotel.

157
00:27:02,957 --> 00:27:05,075
Well, you're bloody
will not sleep in here.

158
00:27:33,492 --> 00:27:35,866
They attacked into the
environmental control system

159
00:27:35,882 --> 00:27:39,129
locked out the safety protocols
and have turned on the gas.

160
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:40,962
Well, that should
have been impossible.

161
00:27:41,209 --> 00:27:43,557
I was told that they have hacked
into our files.

162
00:27:43,807 --> 00:27:44,938
They knew her appointments.

163
00:27:45,085 --> 00:27:47,189
They knew she would be
out of the building.

164
00:27:47,239 --> 00:27:48,552
They weren't targeting her.

165
00:27:49,571 --> 00:27:51,562
They wanted us to see it.

166
00:27:52,803 --> 00:27:56,089
- Where are we, lieutenent?
- New digs.

167
00:28:03,421 --> 00:28:06,557
The old building was declared
strategically vulnerable.

168
00:28:06,922 --> 00:28:08,826
That's putting it marvelly.

169
00:28:08,851 --> 00:28:12,178
Their aim is to breach the most secured
computer system in Britain.

170
00:28:12,203 --> 00:28:14,557
So we are at war
with them now.

171
00:28:15,144 --> 00:28:17,406
This is part of Churchill's bunker.

172
00:28:17,456 --> 00:28:20,349
Some of these tunnels
are dating back to the 18th century.

173
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:22,707
Quite fascinating,
if it wasn't for the rats.

174
00:28:22,929 --> 00:28:25,550
- When do I see M?
- Tomorrow, you'll see M...

175
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,515
and Mallory too
if you're lucky.

176
00:28:28,565 --> 00:28:29,203
Who is Mallory?

177
00:28:29,382 --> 00:28:31,433
The new chairman of the
Intelligence and Security Committee.

178
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:34,717
A charming man, I think.
You and him will really gonna hit it off.

179
00:28:37,121 --> 00:28:38,843
Welcome to the new MI6.

180
00:28:55,544 --> 00:28:57,784
We've have attempted to trace
the computer message, but...

181
00:28:58,311 --> 00:29:01,081
it was sent by an asymmetrical
security algorithm...

182
00:29:01,589 --> 00:29:02,962
with the chance to signal
all over the globe

183
00:29:03,014 --> 00:29:05,202
through thousands
of different servers.

184
00:29:05,269 --> 00:29:06,671
And now that they've accessed
M's code,

185
00:29:06,721 --> 00:29:09,473
it's only a matter of time before
they are able to decrypt the list.

186
00:29:09,553 --> 00:29:12,932
Q branch has been analyzing pictures.,
But so far, nothing.

187
00:29:13,068 --> 00:29:15,282
General feeling it's probably
something from her past

188
00:29:15,574 --> 00:29:17,780
Perhaps when she was
running things in Hong Kong.

189
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,508
- It is no idea what it all means?
- And you believe that?

190
00:29:21,543 --> 00:29:24,582
The truth is we don't have
a clue of what's on the list...

191
00:29:24,607 --> 00:29:27,758
or what they are trying
to do with it.

192
00:29:33,524 --> 00:29:35,497
We can always do this later.

193
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:39,193
You know what?
Let's.

194
00:30:45,532 --> 00:30:48,213
I'd like to start with some
simple words' sensations.

195
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,894
Just tell me the first word
that punch into your head.

196
00:30:51,346 --> 00:30:53,351
For example I might day,
and you might say...

197
00:30:53,401 --> 00:30:55,374
Wasted.

198
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,759
All right.

199
00:31:05,318 --> 00:31:06,098
Gun.

200
00:31:07,195 --> 00:31:07,827
Shot.

201
00:31:07,877 --> 00:31:09,912
- Agent.
- Provocative.

202
00:31:10,621 --> 00:31:12,355
- Woman.
- Provocatrix.

203
00:31:12,981 --> 00:31:15,480
- Heart.
- Target.

204
00:31:16,065 --> 00:31:18,367
- Bird.
- Sky.

205
00:31:18,417 --> 00:31:20,670
- M.
- Bitch.

206
00:31:23,652 --> 00:31:25,704
- Sunlight.
- Swim.

207
00:31:25,814 --> 00:31:27,439
- Moonlight.
- Dance.

208
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,424
- Murder.
- Employment.

209
00:31:30,746 --> 00:31:32,395
- Country.
- England.

210
00:31:32,699 --> 00:31:34,411
Skyfall.

211
00:31:39,621 --> 00:31:41,126
Skyfall.

212
00:31:44,448 --> 00:31:46,692
Done.

213
00:31:51,888 --> 00:31:53,830
This is going well.

214
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:42,870
Get these analyzed.

215
00:32:44,153 --> 00:32:46,004
When arrives, on me.

216
00:33:14,099 --> 00:33:15,134
She's ready for you.

217
00:33:16,145 --> 00:33:17,614
I'm sorry.
Have we met before?

218
00:33:19,094 --> 00:33:20,911
I am the one
who sould say "sorry".

219
00:33:23,588 --> 00:33:24,934
It was only four ribs.

220
00:33:25,649 --> 00:33:27,523
There's nonetheless
vital organs.

221
00:33:29,514 --> 00:33:31,531
Nothing major.

222
00:33:36,466 --> 00:33:38,115
No enough excitment
in Istambul?

223
00:33:38,291 --> 00:33:39,611
I've been reassigned.

224
00:33:39,677 --> 00:33:41,973
Temporary suspension
from field work.

225
00:33:42,125 --> 00:33:45,304
- Really?
- Something to do with killing 007.

226
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:49,131
- Well, you gave it your best shot.
- It was hardly my best shot.

227
00:33:49,782 --> 00:33:51,500
I'm sure
I can survive your best.

228
00:33:51,934 --> 00:33:53,685
Time you'll get the chance.

229
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:55,036
Would you do me a favor,
will you?

230
00:33:55,072 --> 00:33:57,165
If they'll do let you back
out there...

231
00:33:58,383 --> 00:34:00,282
Warn me first.

232
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:03,082
I'm assisting Gareth Mallory
in the transition...

233
00:34:03,132 --> 00:34:05,331
and then I'll be back
in the field.

234
00:34:05,536 --> 00:34:08,070
- That's what you want?
- Yes, of course.

235
00:34:08,623 --> 00:34:11,342
- This is not for everyone.
- Ah, 007...

236
00:34:12,072 --> 00:34:13,511
It's this way.

237
00:34:13,536 --> 00:34:15,093
In your defense...

238
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:18,134
a moving target
is much harder to hit.

239
00:34:19,317 --> 00:34:22,525
Then you better
keep moving.

240
00:34:32,569 --> 00:34:36,353
The whole office goes off in smoke
and that bloody thing survives.

241
00:34:36,381 --> 00:34:40,764
Your interior decorating tips
have always been appreciated, 007.

242
00:34:41,275 --> 00:34:43,376
007, Gareth Mallory.

243
00:34:43,426 --> 00:34:46,822
I hope I haven't miss anything
that P.M. does prattle in line of a crisis.

244
00:34:46,847 --> 00:34:49,525
- Bond.
- Mallory.

245
00:34:54,364 --> 00:34:56,510
I have just been reviewing
Bond's tests.

246
00:34:57,156 --> 00:35:00,347
Seems you passed.
Mind the scheme of your tiff?

247
00:35:00,838 --> 00:35:02,396
You're back
on active service.

248
00:35:03,707 --> 00:35:06,256
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

249
00:35:08,267 --> 00:35:10,483
- I'll be outside.
- I may have one question.

250
00:35:11,912 --> 00:35:14,483
Why not stay dead?

251
00:35:15,233 --> 00:35:16,951
You have
the perfect way out.

252
00:35:17,001 --> 00:35:18,670
Go and live quietly
somewhere.

253
00:35:19,112 --> 00:35:22,591
Not many field agents
get to live this cleanly.

254
00:35:22,641 --> 00:35:24,543
Do you get out
in the field much?

255
00:35:25,443 --> 00:35:28,153
You don't need to be an operative
to see the obvious.

256
00:35:29,477 --> 00:35:31,249
It's a young men's game.

257
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:33,800
Look, you've been
seriously injured.

258
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:36,348
There's no shame in saying
you have lost a step.

259
00:35:36,661 --> 00:35:39,580
The only shame, it would be
not admitting until it's too late.

260
00:35:40,614 --> 00:35:44,202
I'm in, or fire me.
Entirely up to you.

261
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,369
If he says he is ready,
he is ready.

262
00:35:47,606 --> 00:35:49,694
Perhaps
you can't see at all.

263
00:35:49,744 --> 00:35:50,522
Maybe you will.

264
00:35:50,572 --> 00:35:52,214
What exactly
are you implying?

265
00:35:52,672 --> 00:35:54,588
You are sentimental
about him.

266
00:35:55,877 --> 00:35:57,278
As long as I am the head
of this department,

267
00:35:57,702 --> 00:35:59,924
I'll choose my own
operatives.

268
00:36:01,671 --> 00:36:03,162
Fair enough.

269
00:36:07,588 --> 00:36:08,968
Good luck, 007.

270
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:12,497
Don't cock it out.

271
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:21,111
We've analyzed
these shrapnel fragments.

272
00:36:22,126 --> 00:36:24,966
You're lucky it wasn't a direct hit.
It would have cutted you in half.

273
00:36:25,294 --> 00:36:28,313
It's a depleted uranium shell.
A military grade.

274
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:31,328
Hard to get,
extremely expensive

275
00:36:31,626 --> 00:36:35,092
and only used by select few.

276
00:36:35,142 --> 00:36:36,533
You recognize anyone?

277
00:36:38,242 --> 00:36:39,563
Him.

278
00:36:40,515 --> 00:36:42,657
Okay, the name is Patrice.

279
00:36:42,982 --> 00:36:43,678
He's a ghost.

280
00:36:43,728 --> 00:36:45,554
An unknown resident
without country of origin.

281
00:36:45,588 --> 00:36:47,145
How do we find him?

282
00:36:47,195 --> 00:36:50,477
Well, luckily I used to have one
or two friends left in the CIA.

283
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:53,379
They're after him for the Yemeni
ambassador's murder.

284
00:36:53,429 --> 00:36:54,660
And they're getting close.

285
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:58,737
Intel is he's gonna be in Shanghai
in two days time. Probably a new job.

286
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:01,314
You have to go there
and wait further instructions.

287
00:37:01,364 --> 00:37:03,336
If he turns up, it's yours.

288
00:37:03,386 --> 00:37:06,647
Find out who he worked for
and who has the list.

289
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:10,431
- Then, terminate him for Ronson.
- With pleasure.

290
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:14,658
Is there anything else
you want to tell me?

291
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,076
No.

292
00:37:17,126 --> 00:37:19,987
Report to the new quarter master
for a few documentation.

293
00:37:20,327 --> 00:37:23,885
He hasn't set up sharp yet, but
Tanner will put you two together.

294
00:37:23,935 --> 00:37:25,060
Good luck.

295
00:37:25,422 --> 00:37:26,828
Thank you.

296
00:37:30,501 --> 00:37:31,840
007...

297
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:35,461
You are ready for this?

298
00:37:36,728 --> 00:37:38,058
Yes, ma'am.

299
00:37:41,828 --> 00:37:43,221
I didn't know
Bond passed the tests.

300
00:37:44,334 --> 00:37:46,001
He didn't.

301
00:38:15,387 --> 00:38:17,507
Always makes me feel
a little melancholy.

302
00:38:18,089 --> 00:38:22,168
A grand whole warship being
ignominiously hold the way to scrap.

303
00:38:24,951 --> 00:38:27,617
Inevitabilty of time,
don't you think?

304
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:31,319
What do you see?

305
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,972
A bloody big ship.

306
00:38:36,164 --> 00:38:37,341
Excuse me.

307
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,966
007...

308
00:38:40,338 --> 00:38:41,874
I'm your new
Quarter master.

309
00:38:43,832 --> 00:38:45,654
You must be joking.

310
00:38:46,378 --> 00:38:48,123
Why, because I'm not wearing
a lab coat?

311
00:38:48,337 --> 00:38:50,595
Because you still have spots.

312
00:38:51,434 --> 00:38:53,135
My complexion
is hardly relevant.

313
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,621
And your confidence is.

314
00:38:56,177 --> 00:38:57,928
Age is no guarantee
of efficiency.

315
00:38:58,054 --> 00:39:00,440
And youth is no guarantee
of innovation.

316
00:39:01,364 --> 00:39:03,496
Oh, how's it I can do more damage
on my laptop

317
00:39:03,521 --> 00:39:06,394
sitting in my pyjamas before
my first cup of Old Grey

318
00:39:06,419 --> 00:39:08,412
than you could do
in a year in the field.

319
00:39:08,437 --> 00:39:10,093
So why do you need me?

320
00:39:11,414 --> 00:39:13,676
Every now and then
a trigger has to be pulled.

321
00:39:14,507 --> 00:39:16,293
Or not pulled.

322
00:39:16,798 --> 00:39:19,916
It is hard to know which
in your pyjamas.

323
00:39:23,283 --> 00:39:28,533
- Q...
- 007.

325
00:39:31,163 --> 00:39:33,033
Ticket to Shanghai.

326
00:39:33,083 --> 00:39:35,283
- Documentation and passport.
- Thank you.

327
00:39:35,318 --> 00:39:38,533
And this.

328
00:39:40,802 --> 00:39:43,554
Walter PPK, it's 9mm short.

329
00:39:44,283 --> 00:39:46,429
There's a microdermal sensor
in the grip...

330
00:39:47,314 --> 00:39:50,293
encoded to your palm print,
so only you can fire it.

331
00:39:51,073 --> 00:39:54,633
That's a random killing machine
more than a personal statement.

332
00:39:55,283 --> 00:39:56,641
And this?

333
00:39:58,037 --> 00:40:00,492
Standard as your
radio transmitter.

334
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:03,861
Activated and broadcast
your own location.

335
00:40:04,585 --> 00:40:05,828
Distress it.

336
00:40:07,419 --> 00:40:10,492
And that's it.

337
00:40:11,287 --> 00:40:14,626
A gun, and a radio.

338
00:40:16,934 --> 00:40:18,657
Not exactly Christmas, isn't it?

339
00:40:19,767 --> 00:40:22,262
Were you expecting
an exploding pen?

340
00:40:23,908 --> 00:40:26,066
We don't really go in
for that anymore.

341
00:40:33,935 --> 00:40:35,563
Good luck out there
on the field.

342
00:40:36,081 --> 00:40:38,955
And please return
the equipment in one piece.

343
00:40:44,337 --> 00:40:46,048
Brave new world.

343
00:49:05,337 --> 00:49:06,948
Who got the list.

343
00:49:11,537 --> 00:49:13,948
Tell me, who you working for.

344
00:50:43,097 --> 00:50:45,676
Tanner, he has posted
the first five names.

345
00:50:46,536 --> 00:50:47,422
Their cover is blown.

345
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:50,122
They're in danger.
Get them out now.

346
00:51:29,372 --> 00:51:30,624
Room service.

347
00:51:39,718 --> 00:51:41,115
I didn't order anything.

348
00:51:41,636 --> 00:51:42,770
Not even you.

349
00:51:43,013 --> 00:51:44,640
I have got some
new information.

350
00:51:45,721 --> 00:51:48,885
Are not you a little too qualified
to be delivering messages?

351
00:51:49,864 --> 00:51:51,997
It's all part
of the learning curve.

352
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,372
And Q is afraid of flying.

353
00:51:56,897 --> 00:52:00,771
So, whoever stole the list
has already decrypted it.

354
00:52:01,401 --> 00:52:03,889
They posted the first five names
on the web.

355
00:52:03,939 --> 00:52:07,326
- It was only a matter of time.
- That should be the start.

356
00:52:07,376 --> 00:52:10,713
They're posting five more
next week and the week after.

357
00:52:11,619 --> 00:52:13,788
It's some kind of
sadistic game.

358
00:52:18,573 --> 00:52:20,193
Cut through razor.

359
00:52:21,829 --> 00:52:23,622
How very traditional.

360
00:52:24,917 --> 00:52:27,985
Well, I'm going to do some things
the old-fashion way.

361
00:52:30,297 --> 00:52:32,914
Sometimes the old ways
are the best.

362
00:52:43,492 --> 00:52:45,860
Are you putting your life
in my hands again?

363
00:52:48,553 --> 00:52:53,168
Tans, already briefed me
on the list...

364
00:52:54,622 --> 00:52:58,699
raising the tantalizing question
of what you are really doing here.

365
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:02,917
The official directive
was to help...

366
00:53:04,292 --> 00:53:07,700
in anyway I can.

367
00:53:07,862 --> 00:53:10,606
Like spying for Mallory.

368
00:53:12,315 --> 00:53:14,550
You know, Mallory
is not as bad as you think.

369
00:53:16,123 --> 00:53:18,265
He is a bureaucrat.

370
00:53:18,822 --> 00:53:20,701
You should do
your homework.

371
00:53:21,641 --> 00:53:23,560
Gareth Mallory
was Lieutenant Colonel...

372
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:26,808
Lieutenant Colonel in Northern
Ireland Herford regiment.

373
00:53:26,858 --> 00:53:29,490
He spent three months
at the hands of the IRA.

374
00:53:31,043 --> 00:53:33,514
So there's more to him
that meets the eye.

375
00:53:36,661 --> 00:53:38,145
We'll see.

376
00:53:39,851 --> 00:53:41,360
Keep still.

377
00:53:43,588 --> 00:53:46,185
This is the tricky part.

378
00:53:57,665 --> 00:53:59,618
That's better.

379
00:54:00,472 --> 00:54:03,364
- You know the part now.
- Mmh, mmh.

380
00:54:05,395 --> 00:54:07,036
And what part is that?

381
00:54:09,208 --> 00:54:10,570
Old dog...

382
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:13,885
new tricks.

383
00:55:25,409 --> 00:55:26,645
Good evening.

384
00:55:27,149 --> 00:55:28,369
Good evening.

385
00:55:28,419 --> 00:55:30,478
Don't you touch your ear.

386
00:55:31,564 --> 00:55:33,024
There are three exits.

387
00:55:34,327 --> 00:55:36,344
And lots of blind spots.

388
00:55:36,895 --> 00:55:38,815
I've got them covered.

389
00:55:44,677 --> 00:55:46,107
You look beautiful
in that dress.

389
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:48,307
You could scrub out
about yourself.

390
00:55:48,423 --> 00:55:51,531
It's amazing what one could do
with an extra pair of hands.

391
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:53,439
You're telling mean.

392
00:55:55,204 --> 00:55:56,265
You gamble?

393
00:55:56,786 --> 00:55:59,256
Don't like you a little flatten
now and then?

394
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,642
He doesn't like
to take chances.

395
00:56:09,077 --> 00:56:11,036
Good evening, sir.
How may I help you?

396
00:56:11,186 --> 00:56:12,953
I'd like to cash thes in,
please.

397
00:56:19,874 --> 00:56:21,241
One moment, sir.

398
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:55,846
Good fortune tonight, sir.

399
00:57:01,499 --> 00:57:03,134
Let's hope so.

400
00:57:11,966 --> 00:57:13,948
With compliments
of the house.

401
00:57:14,824 --> 00:57:16,409
Thank you.

402
00:57:36,241 --> 00:57:38,513
Now you can afford
to buy me a drink?

403
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:43,590
Maybe I could give
a stretch or two.

404
00:57:44,936 --> 00:57:47,867
I guess I got good
4 million euros in here.

405
00:57:48,332 --> 00:57:49,500
Not bad.

406
00:57:49,625 --> 00:57:52,547
- I like this game.
- Why don't we play another?

407
00:57:53,686 --> 00:57:55,154
I don't gamble.

408
00:57:58,647 --> 00:58:00,313
I'm not very lucky.

409
00:58:00,749 --> 00:58:03,157
With lucky old friend
in Shanghai.

410
00:58:06,901 --> 00:58:10,021
I've been waiting to see
who'll redeem the chip.

411
00:58:10,545 --> 00:58:14,240
You made such a gold entrance
into our little drama.

412
00:58:14,384 --> 00:58:16,540
Do I have
a complicated plot?

413
00:58:17,671 --> 00:58:19,906
Who doesnt't appreciate
the occasion of twists?

414
00:58:20,373 --> 00:58:24,808
- Mr...
- Bond. James Bond.

415
00:58:25,318 --> 00:58:28,381
Severing,
so Mr. Bond...

416
00:58:28,431 --> 00:58:31,848
shall we discuss your next
performance with all that drink?

417
00:58:32,053 --> 00:58:33,615
Not bad.

418
00:58:36,402 --> 00:58:39,767
Are your friends
be joining us?

419
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:43,767
I'm afraid... it's inevitable.

420
00:58:47,197 --> 00:58:49,435
- She's pretty.
- No, no.

421
00:58:49,493 --> 00:58:52,517
Do you like that ass,
don't you think?

422
00:58:52,567 --> 00:58:54,039
Well, I'll keep you posted.

423
00:59:05,664 --> 00:59:06,959
Perfect.

424
00:59:09,291 --> 00:59:11,978
Would you mind if I ask you
a business question?

425
00:59:13,562 --> 00:59:16,273
Depends on the question.

426
00:59:16,323 --> 00:59:18,985
It has to do with... death.

427
00:59:19,885 --> 00:59:22,093
A subject in which
you're well versed.

428
00:59:22,918 --> 00:59:24,923
How would you know that?

429
00:59:26,068 --> 00:59:28,972
Only a certain kind of woman
wears a backless dress

430
00:59:28,997 --> 00:59:32,001
with a Beretta .70
strapped to her thigh.

431
00:59:32,622 --> 00:59:35,264
One could never be
too careful when...

432
00:59:35,264 --> 00:59:38,262
a handsome man in tuxedos
carry Walters...

433
00:59:40,797 --> 00:59:43,725
I'm correct in assuming
you'll killed Patrice?

434
00:59:44,931 --> 00:59:46,111
Yes.

435
00:59:47,759 --> 00:59:49,606
Might I ask why?

436
00:59:50,927 --> 00:59:53,054
I want to meet
your employer.

437
01:00:05,145 --> 01:00:08,683
Be careful
what you wish for.

438
01:00:09,181 --> 01:00:10,610
You are scared.

439
01:00:11,725 --> 01:00:13,752
Thank you
for the drink...

440
01:00:15,417 --> 01:00:16,899
Mr. Bond.

441
01:00:24,821 --> 01:00:26,507
You put on a good show.

442
01:00:28,836 --> 01:00:30,282
But ever since
we sat down here

443
01:00:30,504 --> 01:00:33,275
you haven't stop looking
at your bodyguards.

444
01:00:34,751 --> 01:00:37,010
The three of them
have been excessive.

445
01:00:37,487 --> 01:00:39,198
They're controlling you.

446
01:00:39,691 --> 01:00:41,103
They're not protecting you.

447
01:00:43,289 --> 01:00:44,591
Tattoo on your wrist...

448
01:00:45,158 --> 01:00:46,593
is Macao's sex trade..

449
01:00:46,685 --> 01:00:49,750
You belonged to one of the houses
when were you, 12?

450
01:00:50,322 --> 01:00:51,913
13?

451
01:00:52,851 --> 01:00:54,863
I can see images
of a way out.

452
01:00:55,651 --> 01:00:58,250
I hope she told
you were in love.

453
01:00:59,617 --> 01:01:02,290
but that was a long time ago.

454
01:01:04,409 --> 01:01:06,454
You know nothing about it.

455
01:01:06,981 --> 01:01:10,442
Right, when a woman is afraid
and pretending not to be.

456
01:01:13,656 --> 01:01:15,631
How much do you know
about fear?

457
01:01:16,191 --> 01:01:18,446
All there is.

458
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:21,048
Not like this.

459
01:01:21,815 --> 01:01:26,671
And... not like him.

460
01:01:26,721 --> 01:01:28,179
I can help you.

461
01:01:29,016 --> 01:01:31,781
- I don't think so.
- Let me try.

462
01:01:34,064 --> 01:01:35,387
How?

463
01:01:36,422 --> 01:01:38,070
Bring me to him.

464
01:01:40,742 --> 01:01:44,400
- Can you kill him?
- Yes.

465
01:01:44,706 --> 01:01:48,400
- Will you?
- Someone usually dies.

466
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:56,400
Perhaps you can.

467
01:02:02,638 --> 01:02:04,648
When I leave,
they're going to kill you.

468
01:02:05,939 --> 01:02:08,636
If you survive,
I'm on the Kimera.

469
01:02:09,116 --> 01:02:10,301
North Harbour...

470
01:02:11,157 --> 01:02:12,820
Berth 7.

471
01:02:13,971 --> 01:02:17,358
We cast off in an hour.

472
01:02:21,669 --> 01:02:24,074
Very nice to have met you,
Mr. Bond.

473
01:02:25,724 --> 01:02:27,132
Good luck.
