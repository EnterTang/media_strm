441
00:58:27,410 --> 00:58:29,510
只支持澳洲队
Only the Aussies, mate!

442
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,390
这就有意思了
This is going to be interesting.

443
00:58:31,390 --> 00:58:32,950
好了  萨罗
Okay, Saroo...

444
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:35,180
你为什么选这门课
Why did you choose this course?

445
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:37,210
你还希望从中获得什么
What else do you want to get out of it?

446
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:25,130
-你好  -你好
- Hi. - Hey!

447
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:25,800

你好

450
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:33,780
嗨  你好吗
Hi, how are you?

451
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:36,270
你们喜欢吃印度菜吗
Do you guys like Indian food?

452
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:40,260
只准备了印度菜  只有这些
That's all we have. That's all we have.

453
00:59:40,730 --> 00:59:43,520
-闻起来好香啊  -我试着学别人...
- It smells so great. - I tried to copy someone...

454
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:47,750
你有没有跳过宝莱坞舞蹈
You've ever done Bollywood dance?

455
00:59:47,770 --> 00:59:49,870
-只动一条腿这样  -对  一条腿
- Oh, just like, one leg. - Yeah, one leg...

456
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:55,800
比如我说"手电筒"  用你们的语言怎么说
Okay, well, like, I say flashlight. What do you say?

457
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:58,740
-口袋灯  -口袋灯[法语]
- Lampo de poche. - Lampo de poche?

458
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:02,370
-口袋灯  -手电筒的说法...
- Lampo de poche. - Flashlight is er...

459
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:04,210
你们怎么叫
What do you say?

460
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:05,280
电筒
Torch.

461
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:06,730
如果你想用手抓着吃
If you want to eat with your hands,

462
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:09,720
就要用馕盛着  像勺子一样
you need to use the naan, like a spoon.

463
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:11,650
-用叉子吧  -不  让他用馕
- Use a fork. - No, let him use the naan.

464
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,650
你们怎么说的士
So how do you say taxi?

465
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:15,390
-的士  -的士
- Taxi. - Taxi.

466
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:17,540
这个词在所有语言里都一样
It is the same in every language.

467
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:18,880
你想用叉子吗  萨罗
Do you want a fork, Saroo?

468
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,900
好啊
Yeah!

469
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:22,870
他像我父亲一样
He's like my father.

470
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,520
-你要不要再来一瓶啤酒  -要  谢谢
- You want another beer? - Yes please, thank you.

471
01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:53,150
古度  我想吃糖耳朵
Guddu, I want some jalebi.

472
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:15,660
你好啊
Hello...

473
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:22,650
你没事吧
You okay?

474
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:32,360
萨罗
Saroo?

475
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:39,540
我并不是来自加尔各答
I'm not from Calcutta.

476
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:44,790
我迷路了
I'm lost.

477
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:48,930
豪拉火车站很大  你当时一定吓坏了
Howrah station is enormous, you must have been freaking out.

478
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:51,530
有一次我去布里朝圣  经过那里
I once went through there on a pilgrimage to Puri,

479
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:53,480
结果我两次没赶上火车
and I missed my connection twice.

480
01:01:53,950 --> 01:01:55,610
你那时候不会说孟加拉语吗
And you didn't speak Bengali?

481
01:01:56,310 --> 01:01:58,060
我当时连那种语言叫什么都不知道
I didn't even know it was called that.

482
01:01:58,630 --> 01:02:01,560
-你在火车上待了多长时间  -好几天吧
- How long were you on the train? - A couple of days.

483
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:03,010
好几天吗
A couple of days?

484
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,020
萨罗  你的家乡在哪里来着
Saroo, what was your hometown again?

485
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:07,060
甘尼斯塔莱
Ganestlay.

486
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:12,350
我一定是记错了  因为没有这个地方
I must have had it wrong because it doesn't exist.

487
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:14,660
但你一定还记得别的线索吧
But there must be something else that you do remember.

488
01:02:18,410 --> 01:02:19,700
那个站台
The platform...

489
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:23,440
我睡着的地方  有一个很大的雨水收集箱
I fell asleep on, there's a big rain tank.

490
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:26,030
那里离甘尼斯塔莱只有几站路
It was only a few stops from Ganestlay.

491
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,730
成千上万的火车站都有雨水收集箱
There are thousands of stations with rain tanks.

492
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:31,360
好吧  这是很久以前的事了
Okay, it was a long time ago.

493
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,460
你有没有听说过一个新项目  叫谷歌地球
Have you heard of this new program, Google Earth?

494
01:02:34,130 --> 01:02:36,630
它很神奇  可以帮你找到世界上任何一个地方
It's incredible, you can find any place from anywhere.

495
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:38,150
听我说  我们可以查出
Listen to me, we can find

496
01:02:38,150 --> 01:02:40,880
当时客运列车的时速是多少
out how fast passenger trains went back then.

497
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:42,360
我们用那个时速
We take that speed,

498
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:44,820
乘以你坐火车的小时数
multiply by the hours that you were on the train.

499
01:02:45,010 --> 01:02:45,940
就成了
That's it!

500
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:47,820
我们能得出搜索半径
We create a search radius.

501
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:50,590
然后在这范围内  找出那个有雨水收集箱的车站
And inside there, you will find the station with the rain tank.

502
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:51,800
没错  可是搜索印度
Yeah, but it will take a

503
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:54,020
所有的火车站  要花上一辈子的时间
lifetime to search all the stations in India.

504
01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:56,230
我有说所有的火车站吗
Did I say all the stations?

505
01:02:56,270 --> 01:02:57,420
好吧  哪怕只找一半
Ok, even half the stations.

506
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,460
各位  我真的不想谈论这件事
Really guys, I don't want to talk about this.

507
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:03,430
你的父母有找过你吗
Did your parents try to find you?

508
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:05,460
-怎么了  -他们当然找过他
- What? - They tried to find him.

509
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:06,720
不  我的意思是
No I just mean like,

510
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:09,760
如果他们找过你  可能会留下书面线索
if they tried to find him, maybe they left like a paper trail.

511
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,000
什么书面线索
What paper trail?

512
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:13,490
-他连自己姓什么都不知道  -我妈不识字
- He didn't know his surname. - My mum couldn't read or write.

513
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:15,960
她做什么工作的
What does she do?

514
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:18,190
劳工  她抬石块的
A labourer, she carried rocks.

515
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:19,240
你妈妈吗
Your mum?

516
01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:28,830
我妈大约四年前去世了
My mom died about four years ago now.

517
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:30,600
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

518
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:33,870
我爸爸还是很生她的气
My dad is still so angry at her.

519
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,570
当然不是因为她病了
Not for getting sick, obviously...

520
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:38,450
而是因为她不肯做化疗
but just for refusing chemo.

521
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:44,210
但她很了解自己  清楚自己想要的生活方式
But she just knew herself, you know? She knew what her terms were

522
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:46,550
以及如何度过余下的时间  所以...
and she knew how she wanted to live, so...

523
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:50,670
大概就是无法接受吧
Just couldn't accept that, I guess.

524
01:03:54,380 --> 01:03:55,910
那你又是什么感觉
And how do you feel?

525
01:03:57,150 --> 01:03:58,740
我很想她
I just miss her.

526
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,810
你觉得巴拉特关于搜索半径那个提议怎么样
And what do you think of Bharat's search radius idea?

527
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:14,980
那是什么意思
What was that?

528
01:04:17,350 --> 01:04:20,780
这是你的舞步吗  你是这样跳舞的吗
Is that your dance? Is that how you dance?

529
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:22,350
天啊
Oh, God!

530
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,930
客运列车速度

531
01:06:55,780 --> 01:07:00,870
塔斯马尼亚岛  霍巴特

532
01:07:26,570 --> 01:07:28,820
你不能再这样下去了
You can't keep going on like this.

533
01:07:31,490 --> 01:07:32,850
让我来帮你
Let me help you.

534
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,170
我们去跑步吧
Let's go for a run.

535
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:43,320
什么
What?

536
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:50,600
露西
Lucy!

537
01:07:58,530 --> 01:07:59,530
过来
Come here.

538
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:02,260
等一下
Hold on.

539
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:03,500
抽筋了
Got a cramp.

540
01:08:06,030 --> 01:08:08,370
你骗我  你作弊
You lied! You cheat.

541
01:09:13,570 --> 01:09:15,170
我从来没给别人看过这个
I never show anybody this.

542
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:17,170
为什么  很美啊
Why? They're beautiful.

543
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:21,580
我真的很喜欢画画  这是我的小爱好
I do enjoy it. My little hobby.

544
01:09:22,910 --> 01:09:25,240
看看曼塔希啊
Oh wow, look at Mantosh!

545
01:09:25,820 --> 01:09:27,660
他今晚会来  我真的很高兴
I'm so glad he's coming tonight.

546
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:30,390
狂妄无礼的小东西
Cheeky little thing.

547
01:09:30,650 --> 01:09:31,690
精力十足
Pure energy.

548
01:09:33,650 --> 01:09:34,890
但是很了不起
But incredible.

549
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,200
真有爱
So sweet!

550
01:09:38,430 --> 01:09:40,130
他一向难以控制  可是
He's been hard to control, but...

551
01:09:40,860 --> 01:09:44,060
却非常聪明
very, very smart... and very...

552
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:48,500
只要他能学会控制自己  他做什么都能成功
I mean, he could do anything if he just learned to control that energy.

553
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:50,040
他任何事情都能做到
He could do it, and do it all.

554
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:53,140
萨罗对他的保护欲很强
Saroo is very protective of him.

555
01:09:57,940 --> 01:09:59,050
我很幸运
I've been blessed.

556
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:04,920
非常幸运
Very blessed.

557
01:10:06,550 --> 01:10:09,690
你妈妈给我看了你以前那些奖杯
Your mom showed me all your old little trophies.

558
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:11,820
妈妈  你不是吧
Mum, you didn't.

559
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:15,760
我都不知道你以前那么喜欢运动
I didn't know you were so athletic.

560
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:18,470
那些只是一半而已  还有很多在车库里
That's only half of them. There's plenty more in the garage.

561
01:10:19,170 --> 01:10:20,530
你去哪儿  伙计
Hey, where you going, mate?

562
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:22,570
把烟抽完
Finishing my smoke.

563
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:24,480
现在我想让他离开沙发
I can barely get him off...

564
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:26,440
-都很难  -露西
- ...the couch these days. - Lucy!

565
01:10:32,110 --> 01:10:33,220
你为什么就不能告诉他们
Why can't you just tell them...

566
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:35,670
-你最近在干什么  -不要说
- what you've been up to? - Don't!

567
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:37,720
告诉我们
Tell us.

568
01:10:38,290 --> 01:10:40,350
他们会理解和支持你
They will understand and they will support you.

569
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:42,690
什么事  快说吧
What? Come on.

570
01:10:42,690 --> 01:10:44,660
嘿  吃晚餐了
Hey, um, dinner!

571
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:47,290
赶快趁热吃吧
Better eat it, while it's hot.

572
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:52,460
-你饿了吗  -是的
- You hungry? - Yeah.

573
01:10:54,270 --> 01:10:55,270
怎么了
What?

574
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:58,660
我错过了什么
What have I missed?

575
01:10:58,870 --> 01:10:59,870
没什么
Nothing.

576
01:11:00,910 --> 01:11:02,610
-她看起来不高兴  -她没有不高兴
- She looks upset. - She's not upset!

577
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:03,910
你又不知道我的感受
You don't know how I feel.

578
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:07,990
萨罗无所不知
Saroo knows everything.

579
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:10,880
他可是专家
He's an expert.

580
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,120
他是个经理
He's a manager.

581
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:16,080
你为什么来这里
Why are you here?

582
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:19,540
因为他是你的兄弟
He's here because he's your brother.

583
01:11:19,830 --> 01:11:20,880
不  他不是
No, he's not.

584
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,770
-我们不一样  -住口  萨罗
- We're different. - Hey, now now, Saroo!

585
01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:31,940
萨罗
Saroo...

586
01:11:39,310 --> 01:11:40,310
好了
All right.

587
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,120
没事的
It's all right.

588
01:11:48,890 --> 01:11:49,890
别这样
Hey hey, no no...

589
01:11:53,490 --> 01:11:56,330
没事了  没事了  停下
It's all right, It's all right... Stop!

590
01:11:57,630 --> 01:11:58,880
不要动
Don't move.

591
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:01,640
没事了
It's okay.

592
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:03,800
干得好啊
Nice one, mate.

593
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:10,930
没事了  没事了  深呼吸  深呼吸
It's okay mate, It's okay, just breathe, mate. Just breathe...

594
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:20,920
我恨他对你造成的伤害
I hate what he's done to you.

595
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,120
对不起
I'm sorry.

596
01:13:14,110 --> 01:13:15,440
萨罗
Saroo!

597
01:13:17,210 --> 01:13:18,280
萨罗
Saroo.

598
01:13:19,950 --> 01:13:21,580
萨罗
Saroo!

599
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:32,290
吻我
Kiss me.

600
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:38,880
别这样  求你了
Stop, please.

601
01:14:39,230 --> 01:14:40,770
看着我
Look at me.

602
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:44,880
看着我
Look at me!

603
01:14:45,370 --> 01:14:46,800
-晚点再谈  行吗  -你魂不守舍的
- Can this wait? - Where are you?

604
01:14:46,970 --> 01:14:49,000
能不能等我们回家再谈
Can this wait 'til we get home?

605
01:14:49,370 --> 01:14:50,950
-行吗  -家
- Yah? - Home?

606
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,340
什么家
What home?

607
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:56,180
你是指我独自待在一个房间
You mean, where I'm alone

608
01:14:56,180 --> 01:14:58,180
你独自待在另一个房间的那个地方吗
in one room and you're alone in another room?

609
01:14:58,380 --> 01:14:59,380
来啊
Come on.

610
01:15:00,210 --> 01:15:01,810
别这样  露西
Stop, Luce. Stop it.

611
01:15:03,150 --> 01:15:04,150
来啊
Come on.

612
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:05,720
求你了
Please.

613
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:09,920
萨罗
Saroo!

614
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:12,260
你必须面对现实
You need to face reality!

615
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:15,480
你说的现实是什么意思
What do you mean? Reality?

616
01:15:17,130 --> 01:15:21,450
你能想象我的心情吗  知道自己亲哥哥
You have any idea what it's like knowing my real brother...

617
01:15:21,690 --> 01:15:24,890
和母亲每一天都在找我
and mother spend everyday of their lives looking for me?

618
01:15:27,390 --> 01:15:30,190
我的亲哥哥每天怎样呼喊着我的名字
How every day my real brother screams my name!

619
01:15:32,730 --> 01:15:33,510
你能想象
Can you imagine the pain

620
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:36,200
他们不知道我的下落的痛苦吗
they must be in for not knowing where I am?

621
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:39,720
25年  露西  25年了
25 years, Luce. 25!

622
01:15:41,310 --> 01:15:43,670
你为什么不告诉我这些心结
Why didn't you tell me that's was happening for you?

623
01:15:44,110 --> 01:15:47,710
我们在优越的生活中  放纵享受着
And we swung about in our privileged lives.

624
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:51,750
那让我觉得恶心
It makes me sick.

625
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:54,180
我必须找到家
I have to find home.

626
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:56,450
他们必须知道  好吗
They need to know, okay?

627
01:15:56,950 --> 01:15:58,460
我从未阻拦过你
I've never stopped you.

628
01:15:58,990 --> 01:16:00,160
我想帮忙
I want to help.

629
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:01,730
我不能再这样下去了
I can't do this anymore.

630
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:03,960
你值得更好的
You deserve more.

631
01:16:04,830 --> 01:16:05,860
别这样
Don't you do that!

632
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,500
你不能这样  这都是你错  可不怪我
Don't you dare do that! This is on you, not on me.

633
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:17,200
萨罗  你在吗  伙计
Saroo, you there, mate?

634
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:21,230
明天是单日国际板球赛
It's One Day International tomorrow.

635
01:19:21,230 --> 01:19:22,700
你想来的话就来吧
You can come over if you like?

636
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,830
我是想告诉你  我修好了船柄
I meant to tell you, I fixed the tiller.

637
01:19:28,370 --> 01:19:30,540
我们为什么不带它出去  我们可以开去海岸
Why don't we take her out? We can head up the coast?

638
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:36,010
嘿  萨罗
Hey, Saroo...

639
01:19:36,870 --> 01:19:38,640
伙计  你妈妈她不...
Mate, your mum's not, um,

640
01:19:40,210 --> 01:19:42,780
听着  我们找不到曼塔希  他又失踪了
look, we've lost track of Mantosh, he's missing again.

641
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:45,550
你知道她有多担心
You know how worried she gets.

642
01:19:54,220 --> 01:19:56,130
我们知道你辞了工作  伙计
We know you quit your job, mate.

643
01:19:57,590 --> 01:19:59,060
我们很担心你  儿子
Just worried about you, son.

644
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:42,740
我最近时不时就去看看它
I've been visiting her.

645
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:48,320
每天晚上我顺着那些街道走回家
Every night I walk those streets home.

646
01:20:49,850 --> 01:20:50,980
从坝上走回家
Home from the dam.

647
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,250
从车站走回家
Home from the station.

648
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:56,350
我现在知道了...
I know now...

649
01:20:57,860 --> 01:20:59,420
路上走的每一步
...every single step of the way.

650
01:21:02,330 --> 01:21:03,530
我想象着...
And I imagine that I'm...

651
01:21:06,030 --> 01:21:07,560
我在它耳旁轻语
...whispering in her ear...

652
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:10,270
我在这  没事了
I'm here, it's alright.

653
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:14,200
她是什么样的
What was she like?

654
01:21:16,410 --> 01:21:17,410
很美
Beautiful.

655
01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:24,210
纽约怎么样
How was New York?

656
01:21:24,950 --> 01:21:25,950
都一样
It's the same.

657
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:29,350
所以  你为什么回来了
So, what brings you back?

658
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:32,620
我拿到经费了
My funding came through.

659
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:34,920
太棒了
It's great!

660
01:21:35,230 --> 01:21:36,230
看吧
See...

661
01:21:36,930 --> 01:21:38,230
他们知道你有多棒
They know how good you are.

662
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:52,340
我很想你
I miss you.

663
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:56,310
我见到你妈妈了
I saw your mom.

664
01:21:57,850 --> 01:21:59,880
她不是很好
She's not doing very well.

665
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:04,010
我担心  如果我告诉她我在找家她会崩溃的
I'm worried, it would kill her if she knew I was searching.

666
01:22:04,890 --> 01:22:06,220
你低估她了
You underestimate her.

667
01:22:07,190 --> 01:22:08,190
她需要你
She needs you.

668
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:22,820
不  给我5卢比  我把这些都搬走
No, give me five rupees then I'll carry them all

669
01:22:22,870 --> 01:22:26,910
好吧  你赢了  拿着吧
Okay, you win, take this

670
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:38,130
他当时搬着西瓜  没看到车过来
He was carrying a watermelon and didn't see it coming

671
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:00,210
怎么了
What?

672
01:23:02,550 --> 01:23:05,250
如果你找到了家  他们却都不在了怎么办
What if you do find home and they're not even there?

673
01:23:08,590 --> 01:23:10,850
你还会不停地去搜寻吗
And you never stop and keep searching?

674
01:23:13,190 --> 01:23:15,180
你不知道过了这么久发生了什么
And you don't know what happens over time,

675
01:23:15,180 --> 01:23:19,300
世事变迁  整个世界都在变
things change, and entire worlds change.

676
01:23:20,470 --> 01:23:22,000
我别无选择
I don't have a choice.

677
01:23:37,050 --> 01:23:38,080
留下来
Stay.

678
01:23:43,350 --> 01:23:44,850
我不能
I can't.

679
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,350
站在那别过来
Stay right there

680
01:24:09,770 --> 01:24:11,660
你不是应该照顾好他的吗
Weren't you supposed to look after him?

681
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:14,110
你去哪了
Where were you?

682
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:15,950
你不爱他了吗
Don't you love him?

683
01:24:40,450 --> 01:24:42,790
约翰和曼塔希乘船出去了
John heard Mantosh is out on the boats.

684
01:24:48,630 --> 01:24:50,090
去抓龙虾了
Doing a lobster run.

685
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:58,840
他明天回来
He's due back tomorrow.

686
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:06,140
所以他会赚很多的现金  又要整天喝酒了
So he'll be flushed with cash, back on the hard stuff.

687
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:13,790
我很抱歉你不能有自己的孩子
I'm sorry you couldn't have your own kids.

688
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:18,320
你说什么
What are you saying?

689
01:25:18,390 --> 01:25:19,390
我们
We...

690
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:21,320
我们
We...

691
01:25:23,530 --> 01:25:25,330
并不是白纸一张
weren't blank pages, were we?

692
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,770
像你亲生的孩子那样
Like your own would have been.

693
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:33,070
你领养的不只是我们  也领回了我们的过去
You weren't just adopting us but our past as well.

694
01:25:35,810 --> 01:25:39,410
-我感觉我们在害死你  -我可以生孩子的
- I feel like, we're killing you. - I could have had kids.

695
01:25:42,610 --> 01:25:43,610
什么
What?

696
01:25:43,810 --> 01:25:45,150
我们选择不生孩子
We chose not to have kids.

697
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:49,290
我们想要你们两个
We wanted the two of you.

698
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:52,230
那才是我们想要的
That's what we wanted.

699
01:25:53,190 --> 01:25:56,810
我们想要你们两个出现在我们的生活里
We wanted the two of you in our lives.

700
01:25:56,820 --> 01:25:58,470
那是我们的选择
That's what we chose.

701
01:26:06,740 --> 01:26:09,420
那也是我爱上你爸爸的原因之一
That's one of the reasons, I fell in love with your dad.

702
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:12,480
因为我们都觉得
Because we both felt, as if...

703
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:16,180
这世界上的人已经够多了
... the world has enough people in it.

704
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:22,990
生个孩子  并不保证任何事会变得更美好
Have a child, couldn't guarantee it will make anything better.

705
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:26,170
但是接受一个像你们这样处于困境的孩子
But to take a child that's suffering like you boys were.

706
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:30,630
给你们一个机会
Give you a chance in the world.

707
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:34,230
那意义非凡
That's something.

708
01:26:35,070 --> 01:26:37,230
我猜你们从来没想过会有这么困难
I bet you never imagined it being this hard.

709
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:39,300
这并不是困难的问题
It's not a matter of hard.

710
01:26:39,900 --> 01:26:41,110
这不是...
It's not a mat...

711
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:47,780
我只有这一条路可以走
There's only one path for me.

712
01:26:48,650 --> 01:26:49,880
我是这么想的
And, that's how I think.

713
01:26:51,780 --> 01:26:53,520
之所以会这样是因为...
That's how this happened because...

714
01:26:56,850 --> 01:26:58,360
在我岁12的时候
When I was 12,

715
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:00,360
我看到过一个幻象
I had a vision.

716
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:11,640
有些人会说那是精神崩溃  但是...
Some people would say, it was a breakdown. But it...

717
01:27:14,940 --> 01:27:18,210
我父亲是个酒鬼  你知道的  就好像
My dad was an alcoholic. You know that, and he was like

718
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:20,430
他不是一个好人
he wasn't a good man.

719
01:27:20,430 --> 01:27:24,180
他那时失去了理智
He was out of control when I was...

720
01:27:26,620 --> 01:27:28,600
而我当时站在屋后
I was standing at the back of the house.

721
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:30,390
我眺望着田野
I was looking out across this field.

722
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:35,930
希望这世界将我吞没
And I just wanted the earth to swallow me up.

723
01:27:38,030 --> 01:27:39,130
我...
And I...

724
01:27:45,340 --> 01:27:48,870
我感受到一股电流  像是被电了一下
I felt an electric current, it was like a shock,

725
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:51,010
好像我浑身上下都在震颤
like a jolt through my whole body.

726
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:53,310
后来我看见...
And then I saw...

727
01:27:53,710 --> 01:27:55,210
一个棕色皮肤的孩子
a brown skinned child

728
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:57,180
穿过田野
across that field.

729
01:28:02,790 --> 01:28:04,660
他站在我的身边
And he was standing beside me.

730
01:28:05,060 --> 01:28:09,550
就在那里  我很强烈地感觉到了
And it was right there and I could feel it so strongly.

731
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:16,000
我人生中第一次感受到了美好的东西
And for the first time in my life I felt something good...

732
01:28:16,470 --> 01:28:19,380
我感觉很愉快
I felt good.

733
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:24,180
我知道那是在指引我
And I knew it was guiding me.

734
01:28:24,310 --> 01:28:27,210
我知道我会没事的
And I knew that I was going to be fine.

735
01:28:30,210 --> 01:28:34,780
那一刻我仿佛看到了我的未来  就在眼前
It was, as if, that moment I could see my future, right there!

736
01:28:36,250 --> 01:28:40,190
因为我一直以为我可以把这个家聚在一起
Because I always thought that I could keep this family together.

737
01:28:41,230 --> 01:28:42,230
现在...
And now...

738
01:28:43,330 --> 01:28:44,630
现在我也不知道了
Now I don't know.

739
01:28:45,460 --> 01:28:46,460
哪里...
Where...

740
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:49,730
-妈妈  -这是怎么回事  我不明白
- Mum... - What's happening? I don't understand.

741
01:28:54,910 --> 01:28:57,010
你再也不跟我谈心了
You don't talk to me any more.

742
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:08,550
我需要你  萨罗
I need you, Saroo.

743
01:29:48,060 --> 01:29:49,060

744
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,470
我为我晚餐时说得话道歉
Sorry for what I said at dinner.

745
01:35:42,250 --> 01:35:43,980

原来你一直就是在做这件事
So this is where you've been.

754
01:37:52,210 --> 01:37:54,180
我不想让你觉得我忘恩负义
I don't want you to feel, I was ungrateful.

755
01:37:57,450 --> 01:37:59,620
我无时无刻不想告诉你
There wasn't a day, I didn't want to tell you.
