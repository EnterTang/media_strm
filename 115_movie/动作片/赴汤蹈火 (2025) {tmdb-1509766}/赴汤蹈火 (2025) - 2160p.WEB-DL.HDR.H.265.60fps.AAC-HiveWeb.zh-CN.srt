00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,790
我从来没想过你了房屋清洁。
I never took you for the go-to guy for house cleaning.

142
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:15,060
没有。 只是抢劫银行。
No. Just robbing banks.

143
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,230
是啊。
Yeah.

144
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,280
他妈的她。 她从没想过跟我没有关系。
Fuck her. She never wanted nothing to do with me anyway.

145
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,460
她会留下吗 ？
She leave a will?

146
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,230
是啊。
Yeah.

147
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:51,800
我在这 ？
Am I in it?

148
00:12:58,770 --> 00:12:59,540
将不重要的。
The will don't matter.

149
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,340
她离开了我的一切。
She left everything to me.

150
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,040
这一切都由星期五我的孩子们。
By Friday it all goes to my boys.

151
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,250
她不想。
She didn't mean nothing by it.

152
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,520
她肯定有这个意思。
She damn sure meant it.

153
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,460
她一直恨我了。
She always hated me for standing up to him.

154
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:19,030
我们都受到了惩罚。
We all got punished.

155
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,390
你从不了解战斗后进行殴打。
You never understood that fighting back makes the beating last longer.

156
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,400
不 ， 我理解。
No, I understood.

157
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,100
这就是为什么我停止打斗和枪杀那婊子养的。
That's why I stopped fighting and shot that son of a bitch.

158
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:36,070
嘿 ， 怎么了 ？
Hey, what's going on?

159
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,870
有人今天上午抢劫了银行。
Somebody robbed the bank this morning.

160
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,470
做什么 ？

00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:42,610
如果你看到有多少 ， 就给我打电话。

侧向不想见我。
Sideways don't wanna meet me.

163

由于错误的一小段绳子。

哦 ， 好吧 ， 事情也就简单为大家但你。
Oh, well, that would simplify things for everyone but you.

165

也许 ， 如果你能找到的树。
Maybe, if you can find the tree.

166
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,630
上帝 ， 我爱得克萨斯西部。

167
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,900
游侠 ？ 嗨 ， 大家好。

168
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,000
不是抢劫

169
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
只受到 7000 美元。

172
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,580
墨水包没有 ？ 不是的。
No ink pack? Nope.

173
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,510
智能。 好聪明。

174
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:20,010
我们可以去看视频吗 ？

178
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,590
我们能看看监控录像吗 ？
Can we get a look at the surveillance video?

179
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,530
我们有摄像头 ，
We got cameras,

180
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,260
但我们在数字交换系统
but they're switching us over to a digital system

181

馈送到该计算机。

182
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,430
这些新的摄像机不以我们的 VCR 。

183
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,370
呼吁年轻县警长。

184
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,600
问他们是否认为他们的相机钩

185

某种记录设备。

早在上午的修改者借机。
A little early in the morning for tweakers.

194
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,030
修改者借机不睡觉。 他们只是微调。
Tweakers don't sleep. They just tweak.

195
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:11,400
他们抢劫药店和停放汽车 ， 不是银行。
They rob drug stores and parked cars, not banks.

196
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,600

197

我认得它们的面孔。

203
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,380
但你能告诉他们吗 ？

204
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,680
黑色、白色 ？

205
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,490
他们的皮肤和灵魂吗 ？
Their skin or their souls?

206
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,990
我们让他们的灵魂。
Let's leave their souls out of this for now.

207
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,560
白色。
White.

208
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,130
这附近的某个地方 ， 我猜 ，
From around here somewhere is my guess,

209
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,560
你知道 ， 从他们的声音。
you know, from their voices.

210
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,260
哦 ？
Oh?

211
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,630
县青年说岁月催人老
Young county says same deal

212
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,500
在奥尔尼的分支。
with the branch in olney.

213
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,600
对不起。
Excuse me.

214
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,200
他们有视频吗 ？
Do they have video?

215
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:54,070
相同的处理。
Same deal all the way around.

216
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,440
没有沃尔玛出售的各类电子装备 ？
Doesn't Walmart sell all sorts of electronic equipment?

217
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:01,280
我的话。 拿开你的手。
My word. Get your hands off that.

218
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,720
好吧 ， 这些孩子 ， 他们的工作还远没有结束 ， 我就告诉你。
Well, these boys, they aren't done yet, I'll tell you that.

219
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,750
怎么会呢 ？ 嗯 ， 他们很有耐心。
How come? Well, they're patient.

220
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,520
仅仅对抽屉
Just sticking to the drawers,

221
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,530
不 ， 那是银行的钱
not taking the hundreds, that's the bank's money,

222
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,490
我们可追查。
we can trace that.

223
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,700
他们试图提出一个确定的量 ， 这是我的猜测。
They're trying to raise a certain amount, that's my guess.

224
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,700
这需要几个银行。
It's gonna take a few banks to get there.

225
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,650
你知道他们怎么富 ？
Your boys know how rich they're gonna be?

226
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,050
他们不知道事情的全部。
They don't know anything yet.

227
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,390
你带他们去葬礼 ？
You take them to the funeral?

228
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,690
就像我说的 ， 他们根本不知道。
Like I said, they don't know anything.

229
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,330
上次你看见没有 ？
When's the last time you saw them?

230
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,570
当我们都去了斯坦福在竞技结束后马上就出来了。
When we all went to the rodeo in stamford right after you got out.

231
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:06,450
那是一年前。 我跟他们交谈的电话。
That was a year ago. I talk to them on the phone.

232
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,710
你跟他们打电话吗 ？

明天去见他们。
Go see them tomorrow.

235
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,300

236
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,560
你有在你前面
You've got enough in your front pocket

237
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:24,860
为解决这个问题。
to fix that problem right now.

238
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,100
我们不能少了它 ， 你知道。
We can't spare it, you know that.

239
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,110
也许我们应该打击另一个分支。
Maybe we should hit another branch.

240
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:40,610
你知道 ， 你说我们不会逍遥法外。 ”
You know, you talk like we ain't gonna get away with this.

241
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,850
我从没见过任何人带东西的。 你呢 ？
I've never met nobody who got away with anything, ever. You?

242
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,390
那么为什么在地狱你会同意吗 ？
Then why in the hell did you agree to do it?

243
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,530
因为你问我 ， 小哥哥。
Because you asked, little brother.

244
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,200
我就像一只老山羊。
I got to shit like an old goat.

245
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:06,910
抓检查 ， 见我出来前。
Grab the check, meet me out front.

246
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,280
好吧 ， 如果不是一个暗示 ，
Well, if that isn't a hint,

247
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,480
我不知道是什么。
I don't know what is.

248
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,690
你的牛排要几分熟 ？
You like your steak?

249
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,390
是的 ， 夫人。

Yeah, you'll be waiting around all day for me to finish this.

你把你的时间。
You take your time.

254
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,480
它在这里肯定很安静。
It sure is quiet in here.

255
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,720
打开抽屉。 五、 10s 、 20s 。
Open the drawer. Fives, 10s, 20s.

256
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,290
风扇像一副扑克牌。
Fan them out like a deck of cards.

257
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,290
你是做什么的 ？
What do you do?

258
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:03,500
最后一份工作是对的。..
Last job was for a...

259
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,760
天然气公司。
Natural gas company.

260
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,400
声音高美元。
Sounds high-dollar.

261
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,840
没有 ， 什么都没有 ， 而高美元左右。
No, there ain't nothing high-dollar about drilling.

262
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,240
似乎没有人在钻探天然气现在 ， 不管怎样。
No one seems to be drilling for gas now, anyway.

263
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,610
他们肯定钻探石油。
They sure drilling for oil.

264
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,540
我的意思是 ， 一个钻的吗 ？
I mean, ain't one drill the same as the next?

265
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,320
这是我的看法。
That's my take on it.

266
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:26,220
我猜 ， 我得让别人相信我。
I guess, I got to get someone else to believe me.

267
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,420
狗娘养的 ！
Son of a bitch!

268
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,860
我们需要个厨师。
We could use a cook.

269
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,500
只是一个想法。
Just a thought.

270
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,630
从而 ， 珍妮安。
Order's up, Jenny Ann.

271

我打赌你不欠这孩子太多的支持。
I bet you don't owe this much in child support.

277

我他妈的想请你帮忙。
I must be out of my goddamn mind to ask you for help.

278
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,870
你想害死我们吗 ？ 嗯 ？

这不是英格兰中部地区的分支。

这不是计划的一部分。

你只是把我们他妈的一天。

你不能回答你的电话吗 ？

289
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:21,800
我开车。 你只是坐在那里抚弄你的胖手指。
I'm driving. You're just sitting there twiddling your fat fingers.

肯定不是修改者借机。

295
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,390
他们知道他们究竟在做什么。

我不知道你怎么生存
I don't know how you're gonna survive

297
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,400
没有其他人。

玛丽贝丝的骑车人。

301

你喜欢鱼。

303
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,420
不多 ， 要全力反击。
Not enough to do it every goddamn day.

304
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,690
是啊 ， 当我退休时 ，

也许这些银行劫匪

想要一场枪战 ，

将不会有多少荣耀。

哦 ， 嗯 ， 我很幸运

我就在河流的牛群。

在最后的时光在家庭护理中 ，

你会想我傻笑。

585

上帝啊 ， 为什么

586
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:59,780
你为什么不回答我的祷告 ？
why won't you answer my prayers?

587
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,050
你乞求他的帮助 ，
You begged him for help,

588
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:02,610
然而你看看你的生活
and yet you look around at your life

589
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,150
并没有什么不同。
and nothing is different.

590
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:07,050
所以 ， 你认为上帝告诉你没有。
And so you assume that god has told you no.

591
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:11,290
上帝没有说不。
God doesn't say no.

592
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:13,690
我们为什么不能回到教练吗 ？
Why couldn't we drive back to lubbock?

593
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:16,860
他们抢劫银行的时候。
They ain't robbing banks in lubbock.

594
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:18,560
我们不是要看这个 ， 是吗 ？
We're not gonna watch this, are we?

595
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,830
你不是基督徒吗 ？
Ain't you Christian?

596
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,240
是啊。 但我不是傻瓜。
Yeah. But I ain't stupid.

597
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,870
神没说这人
God doesn't talk through this man

598
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:27,840
就像我的狗说话。
any more than he talks through my dog.

599
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,610
好吧 ， 那么也许你应该给你的狗听。
Well, then maybe you should give your dog a listen.

600
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:31,780
那你是印度人吗 ？
Ain't you Indian?

601
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:35,010
你本来应该点燃鼠尾草香
You're supposed to be burning Sage

602
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,780
和围着床在跳舞欢呼 ， 像蜜蜂蛰你。
and dancing around the bed whooping like a bee stung you.

603
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,750
我是天主教徒。

604
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,320
来吧。
Come on.

00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:49,660
来吧 ！ 我宁愿跳舞的消防枪。
Come on! I'd rather dance around a fire with a spear.

606
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:52,630
我宁可让你用长矛刺死我也不看这部。
I'd rather have you stab me with a spear than watch this.

607
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:54,700
这个狗娘养的 ， 他不会知道上帝
This son of a bitch, he wouldn't know god

608
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:57,770
如果他就爬上了他的裤腿 ， 并咬了他的小弟弟。
if he crawled up his pant leg and bit him on the pecker.

609
00:42:57,770 --> 00:42:58,940
该死的信道变化。
Change the damn channel.

610
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:09,680
现在 ， 这 ， 这就是使命。
Now, this, this is what god watches right here.

611

别担心 ， 他们会有精彩的足球。
Don't worry, they're gonna have soccer highlights on soon enough.

612
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,920
这是墨西哥的一半。
That's for your Mexican half.

613
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,360
哦 ！
Ooh!

00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:27,370
哇 ， 看看这小子跑。

长角队要有好的团队。
Longhorns are gonna have a good team this year.

616
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:37,180
足球 ， 从来不知道。
That soccer, never could understand that.

617
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:40,280
任何一个 5 岁的不可以做的运动。
Anything a five-year-old can do ain't a sport.

618
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:44,050
是谁发明的 ？ 阿兹特克人吗 ？
Who invented it? Aztecs?

619
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:46,220
“头骨周围惹火了他 ， 对吧 ？
Kickin' around skulls or something, right?

620
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:49,850
听起来像一个科曼奇运动。
Sounds like a comanche sport.

621
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:53,390
你知道 ， 再过三个星期 ，
You know, in three weeks,

622
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:56,830
你可以看任何你想上电视。
you can watch whatever you want on TV all day.

623
00:43:56,830 --> 00:43:59,400
该死 ， 你可以现在就做吧。
Hell, you can do it right now in your own room.

624
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,370
哦 ， 那有啥乐趣 ？
Oh, where's the fun in that?

625

在一年时间内 ，
In a year's time,

628
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:13,280
我逗你 ， 小姐。

629
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:16,710
你就会放声大笑
It's what you'll laugh about

630
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,420
当你站在我坟和良好的祝愿。

上帝 ， 我希望是明天。

632

哦 ， 这个很好。
Oh, that was a good one.

633
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,360
你会熟悉的。
You'll get the hang of this yet.

634
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:36,770
这不是太晚了吗 ？
Isn't it getting late for you?

635
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:42,770
是啊。

看看这些奶子。 你他妈的在开玩笑吗 ？
Look at those titties. Are you fucking kidding me?

639
00:45:57,150 --> 00:45:58,050
你在干什么 ？
What are you doing?

640
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:04,460
睡在门廊 ， 我的未来。
Sleeping on the porch, practicing my future.

641
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,460
这是很危险的一件事我们的生活。
It's a dangerous thing we do for a living.

642

646
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:27,880
如果没有我在你身边 ，

我怀疑你足够近的地方

对于曾经将再次面临危险。

649
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,560
正当我开始觉得对不起他们。
Just when I was starting to feel sorry for you.

650
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:43,900
印度人不应该为自己感到难过。
Indians ain't supposed to feel sorry for cowboys.

651
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:45,160
。
It's the other way around.

652
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:55,540
这让你的遗嘱执行者 ？
And this makes you the executor?

653
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:57,580
Mmm - hmm.

654
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:58,810
不管他们责备我们 ，

655

他们可以带走。

656
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:03,250
没有办法追踪资金的赌场。
There's no way to trace funds from a casino.

657
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:04,980
好吗 ？ 一旦获得所述支票给银行 ，
All right? Once you get the checks to the bank,

658
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,980
信任是无可比拟的。
trust is untouchable.

659
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:10,560
你不能告诉任何人任何事 ， 对吗 ？

660
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,220
嗯 ， 怎么说呢 ？
Well, what is there to tell?

661
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:14,960
我的意思是 ， 你们赢了钱 ， 赌博 ， 不是吗 ？
I mean, you boys won that money gambling, didn't you?

662
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:21,130
3.2 万美元还清抵押贷款。
$32,000 pays off the reverse mortgage.

663
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:24,340
和那些杂种把物业税从 2012 年到现在 ，
And those bastards paid the property tax from 2012 to now,

664
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:26,600
这是另一个 11000 美元。
that's another $11,000.

665
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:31,040

So, $43,000 and you are free and clear.

666
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,610

Just have the loan officer fax me a release of lien,

667
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:37,220

00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:44,960
远不是我。

672
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:45,960
你为什么那么做 ？
Why you doin' it then?

673
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:54,400
你知道 ， 他们也只能借给他们。
You know, they loaned the least they could.

674
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,500
我的工作只是让你可怜的妈妈的保证收益。
Just enough to keep your mama poor on a guaranteed return.

675
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:03,470
她以为他们可以刷卡土地售价 25000 美元。
Thought they could swipe her land for $25,000.

676
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,940
就这样嚣张 ， 它让我的牙齿受到伤害。
That's just so arrogant, it makes my teeth hurt.

677

支付这些杂种回自己的钱吗 ？

679
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,560
好吧 ， 如果你不给 ， 我不知道是什么。

真的很想你无迹可循?

688

德州米德兰处理你得到这种信任。

689
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,530

我们只是坐在这里

看看这个被他们抢劫的分支。

看照片并不重要

799
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,820
因为没有人知道这些狗娘养的样子。
because nobody knows what these sons of bitches look like.

我知道你在做什么。

You're trying to make this last as long as you can because the longer it lasts,

越远 ， 从门廊前。

I mean, how is anybody supposed to make a living here?

你的人也是。

直到有人出现并杀了他们

821

把他们放下 ， 把你变成他们中的一员。

你想明天 ？
You thinking about tomorrow?

830
00:58:20,990 --> 00:58:22,090
不是吗 ？
Ain't you?

831
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,960
那个小旅馆职员。
That little hotel clerk.

832
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:28,830
为什么总是那么的甜粽
Why is it always the sweet ones

833
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:31,170
这样 ， 当你是魔鬼让他们兴奋起来了呢 ？
that are such devils when you get them revved up?

834
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:35,140
不知道 ， 从来没有一个甜一个。
Wouldn't know, never had a sweet one.

835
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:38,540
是啊 ， 你觉得很生气。
Yeah, you like them pissed off,

836
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:39,910
找替罪羊。
lookin' for someone to blame.

837
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:43,210
肯定是这样。
Sure seems that way.

838
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:57,090
幸好你在干什么。
It's a good thing you're doing.

839
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:01,230
我们正在做它。
We're doing it.

840
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,680
银行柜员的明天。
Go easy on the bank teller tomorrow.

841
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:22,290
我会老实的年轻护士。
I'll be as gentle as a young nurse.

842
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,020
你来吗 ？
You coming?

843
01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:30,350
在路上了。
On my way.

844

845
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:17,770

是的 ， 早餐不错。
Yeah, breakfast sounds good.

849
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:36,790
所以我们击中了杰顿第一分支 ， 然后 ， 对吗 ？
So we hit the jayton branch first, then Coleman, right?

850
01:01:36,790 --> 01:01:38,120
对 ， 这让我们所需要的。
Yeah, that should get us what we need.

851
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:34,850
让我们这样做的。
Let's do this.

852
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:42,150
啊该死.. 。
Ugh... shit.

853
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:43,490
这他妈的不是计划的一部分。
That's not part of the fucking plan.

854
01:02:43,490 --> 01:02:44,890
混蛋关闭分支。
Bastards closed down the branch.

855
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:48,390
什么现在吗 ， 小弟 ？

科尔曼。
Coleman.

857
01:03:26,430 --> 01:03:27,800

我们得为后。
We gotta head to post.

859
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:30,230
什么是地狱你在干什么 ？ 让。..

只有一个人科尔曼。
There's only one teller in Coleman.

864
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:45,450
无论我们是不够的。
Whatever we get won't be enough.

865
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,550
现在我们转到科尔曼。

如果这不是足够 ， 头部向后。
If that ain't enough, we head to post.

867
01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:50,990
如果我们不能离开现在的岗位 ，
If we don't leave now for post,

868
01:03:50,990 --> 01:03:52,320
我们不会到中午。
we won't get there till noon.

869
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:55,260
你不想在午餐时间去抢银行 ， 是吗 ？
You don't wanna rob a bank at lunchtime, do you?

870
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:56,830
是啊 ， 我们不知道的人。
Yeah, we don't know the patterns of folks out there.

871

这些图案都是一样的。
The patterns are the same everywhere.

872

876
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,410
狗屎。
Shit.

877
01:04:17,950 --> 01:04:20,420
我觉得我有这种情况。
I think I got this figured.

878
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:25,890
两个第一银行 ， 他们分别是得克萨斯州米德兰银行。
First two banks, they were Texas midland banks.

879
01:04:25,890 --> 01:04:27,920
好吧 ， 有七家分公司。
All right, there are seven branches altogether.

880
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:30,330
主要分支是在沃思堡。

881
01:04:30,330 --> 01:04:33,300
他们不会扰乱。
They're not gonna mess with that.

882
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:36,900
好吗 ？ 他们在奥尔良分支。

884
01:04:39,470 --> 01:04:40,940
然后还有一个在这里。
Then there's the one here.

885
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:42,240
他们没有击中。
Which they did not hit.

886
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:47,910
艾伯特 ， 你会请吗 ？ ”
Alberto, will you please follow me?

887
01:04:49,450 --> 01:04:51,580
只是闭上你的嘴
Just keep your mouth shut

888
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:53,550
且先听我说。
and just listen to what I'm gonna say.

889
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:56,390
这里有一个 ，
There's the one here,

890
01:04:56,390 --> 01:04:58,220
还有一个在切。
then there's the one in childress.

891
01:04:58,220 --> 01:04:59,990
这是一个在杰顿。
There's the one in jayton.

892
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:01,490
一个封闭的。
That one's closed.

893
01:05:01,490 --> 01:05:03,090
我知道一个人的 ！
I know that one's closed!

894
01:05:06,030 --> 01:05:08,470
我知道 ， 一个已经关门 ， 阿尔贝托。
I know that one's closed, Alberto.

895
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:14,910
我就是这么想的。 杰顿。
That's my point. Jayton is closed.

896
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:17,370
刚刚离开岗位。
That just leaves post.

897
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:19,140
他们不会在餐厅与银行 Childress,
They're not gonna mess with the bank in childress,

898
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:20,610
那是一个相当不错的。
that's a fairly decent-sized town.

899
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:25,380
在分支的中部哈 ， 两人一见钟情。
The branch in Vernon wasn't Midlands and they hit that.

900

是啊 ， 一个不戴。 孤单。
Yeah, one of them did. Alone.

901
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:31,150
然后他一路跑到马路对面去了。
Then he ran all the way across the road to get to the car.

902
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,390
我认为他的搭档都不知道会发生这种事。
I think his partner had no idea that was gonna happen.

903
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:35,390
这意味着什么呢 ？
And what does that mean to us?

904
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:38,400
它只意味着分支 ， 是在后的为准。
It means that the only branch that fits the bill is in post.

905

I can't let you do that. You just get me there.

01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:55,830
是的。 他说 ， 他看上去像是你的从就餐者手中。
Yup. He said he didn't look like the fella from the diner.

1107
01:27:55,830 --> 01:27:58,300
他没认出 Tanner 的照片。
He didn't recognize Tanner's photo either.

1108
01:27:58,300 --> 01:27:59,900
是啊。 试图取得法院命令

Da 。 Toby 没有记录。

他从来没有被逮捕。

他只是在他出庭离婚案。

1113
01:28:07,540 --> 01:28:09,750
他没有达到这个标准 ， 马库斯。
He don't fit the bill, Marcus.

1114
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:11,550
人们不要去抢劫银行。
People don't start out robbing banks.

1115
01:28:11,550 --> 01:28:13,820
他们毕业时 ， 希望能像他的弟弟混蛋。
They graduate to it like his asshole brother.

1116
01:28:13,820 --> 01:28:15,580
此外 ， 当我们到那里时 ，

1117

我们看到两个工作人员从雪佛龙

压盖井和投放 pumpjacks 。
capping Wells and putting in pumpjacks.

1119
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:21,490
工程师说那时候他们

1120
01:28:21,490 --> 01:28:23,660
2000 桶 ， 请假一个月。
2,000 barrels a month off that place.

1121
01:28:23,660 --> 01:28:25,390
你只是试着说服法官
You just try convincing a judge

1122

权某人

1125
01:28:31,740 --> 01:28:33,400
米德兰管理信托 ？
Midland manages the trust?

1126
01:28:36,870 --> 01:28:39,410
他们真是希望这东西。
You'd think they'd want this thing figured out.

1127
01:28:39,410 --> 01:28:41,480
我不认为银行不关心任何事
I don't think the bank cares about anything

1128
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:44,010
但是 ， 就在其信任。
but keeping that trust right where it is.

1129
01:28:44,010 --> 01:28:46,080
地狱 ， 他们不那么合作的律师比托比。
Hell, they were less cooperative than Toby's attorney.

1130
01:28:48,790 --> 01:28:51,790
马库斯 ， 他并不是嫌疑犯 ， 你退休了
Marcus, he's not a suspect and you are retired.

1131
01:28:52,890 --> 01:28:53,990
哦 ， 我听到你。

我知道为什么你的哥哥 Tanner 、干的。

如果我没有把他的脑袋 ，

1158
01:32:49,990 --> 01:32:53,700
一个新的卡车在摩托艇
there'd be a new truck out front with jet skis,

1159
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:55,700
一切他能想到买。

他买所有刚刚给他

更多的借口来窃取。

帮助我理解他 ， 然后。

为什么 4 人死亡

1171
01:33:29,170 --> 01:33:30,370

通过设置这种运动的事物。

你指望我相信这个计划对于你的兄弟吗 ？
You expect me to believe your dimwitted brother planned this?

1179

我可怜的我的整个生活。

我的父母 ， 他们的父母在他们面前。
So were my parents, their parents before them.

1182
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:09,300
这就像一种传染病
It's like a disease

1183
01:34:11,270 --> 01:34:13,710
传承性 ，
passing from generation to generation,

1184
01:34:13,710 --> 01:34:14,880
成为一种病 ， 就是这样。

感染每个人你知道 ，
