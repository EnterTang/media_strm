00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:57,820
-Elizabeth -Over here -Look here please -Elizabeth -We love you -We love you


3
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,460
You got it!


4
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,780
feel that power


5
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,540
And mark


6
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,020
Come on!


7
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,020
Butt! Hip!


8
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,160
Oh yeah


9
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,500
Square! Think about those bikini bathes you wanna...


10
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,980
look like a giant jellyfish on the beach


11
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,500
Come on!


12
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:19,000
I'll fucking show you.


13
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:22,660
You wanna see some Jurassic Fitness?


14
01:30:25,100 --> 01:30:26,340
You want it?!


15
01:30:27,330 --> 01:30:31,200
Come on


16
01:30:39,330 --> 01:30:42,080
But my mother was a huge fan of hers.


17
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,860
So


18
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:50,840
Sparkle


19
01:30:50,860 --> 01:30:52,880
So


20
01:30:53,180 --> 01:30:54,820
Whether I liked it or not.


21
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:57,100
I guess that's why you could say


22
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:58,840
we have some sort of connection.


23
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:00,620
Some sort of connection.


24
01:31:00,660 --> 01:31:03,420
You wouldn't exist without me.


25
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:14,760
Bum


26
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:19,280
It is time


27
01:31:19,300 --> 01:31:20,960
The question that we ask


28
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:25,140
-each and every one of our guests. -Okay.


29
01:31:25,830 --> 01:31:30,580
Would you share one of your little beauty secrets with us?


30
01:31:32,170 --> 01:31:33,640
Just one little trick of yours


31
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:36,600
that helps you look so incredibly stunning.


32
01:31:36,620 --> 01:31:37,620
I mean


33
01:31:37,620 --> 01:31:38,820
I don't know. Uh...


34
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:39,760
Say it!


35
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:41,500
Say it!


36
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:43,480
Let me think.


37
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:44,440
Say it!


38
01:31:44,460 --> 01:31:47,320
Tell them who your little beauty secret is!


39
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:50,160
-I guess


40
01:31:50,180 --> 01:31:51,960
Here's your little beauty secret.


41
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:53,770
I guess I just try to be myself.


42
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:57,220
To be sincere and grateful for all that I have.


43
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:59,900
And to always remember to live with my heart.


44
01:31:59,950 --> 01:32:02,540
Oh


45
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:16,600
I just


46
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:19,720
Stop it!


47
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:21,540
Stop it.


48
01:32:21,580 --> 01:32:23,740
You're taking it from me.


49
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:25,920
That's your little secret.


50
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:41,240
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!......


51
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:47,340
You have to control yourself!


52
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:08,400
I can't go back


53
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:14,800
Oh.


54
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:19,220
Gross old rat.


55
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:21,000
Stop it!


56
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:42,880
Coming to bed?


57
01:34:44,120 --> 01:34:45,160
Yes


58
01:35:51,580 --> 01:35:52,400
Yes.


59
01:35:52,420 --> 01:35:55,180
Hi


60
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:57,260
There's no more stabilizer fluid.


61
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:00,080
Hello?


62
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:03,380
It's fucking 503.


63
01:36:03,410 --> 01:36:04,040
Yes.


64
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:05,440
Fuck!


65
01:36:05,460 --> 01:36:06,690
I'm telling you


66
01:36:06,700 --> 01:36:08,230
There's no more stabilizer fluid.


67
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:10,220
It means you've reached the end.


68
01:36:12,420 --> 01:36:13,600
What do you mean the end?


69
01:36:13,700 --> 01:36:15,480
You've drained it all out.


70
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:18,460
If you want more


71
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:20,460
Tell me how to do it.


72
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:23,200
I need to stabilize myself right now.


73
01:36:23,300 --> 01:36:25,000
You simply have to switch.


74
01:36:27,620 --> 01:36:28,890
Excuse me?


75
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,880
The switch reboots the fluid secretion process


76
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:34,260
so you can continue to enjoy the experience.


77
01:36:34,300 --> 01:36:36,320
No


78
01:36:36,580 --> 01:36:38,460
I can't switch


79
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:40,160
Especially not now.


80
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,120
Push!


81
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,780
You got it! Hang in there ladies


82
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,340
You got it!


83
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,360
Today's worked out baby!


84
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,720
All right then hope I'll see you next week


85
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,340
for Sparkle You Life


86
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,800
you know


87
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,980
but at the mean time


88
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,480
work's fine


89
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,740
Great jobs


90
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,080
-You got it! -Nice one


91
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,720
Happy birthday.


92
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,960
thank you


93
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,800
Happy birthday.


94
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,880
Oh


95
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:02,960
Happy birthday.


96
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,240
Thank you.


97
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,660
I don't care if every fucking young girl in the fucking town


98
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,180
in these few weeks.


99
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,260
Look


100
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,280
We need her young.


101
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,580
We need her hot.


102
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,240
We need her now.


103
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,400
How the old bitch has been able to stick around for this long.


104
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,980
That's the fucking mystery to me.


105
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,200
Oh


106
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,000
When was that back in the 30s?


107
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,020
What


108
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,260
No


109
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,480
This is network TV


110
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,040
not a fucking charity.


111
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,320
Find me somebody new.


112
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,800
Now.


113
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:16,660
Hey


114
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,420
How old is Jennifer?


115
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,660
You better get busy.


116
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,780
It's like when you see someone fart on screen.


117
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,020
People just love that.


118
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,860
I mean


119
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,440
So you know what I mean?


120
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,040
People are just people.


121
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,100
And I have to give people what they want.


122
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,190
That's what keeps the shareholders happy.


123
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,780
And people always ask for something new.


124
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,660
Renewal is inevitable.


125
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,180
And at 50


126
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,580
it stops.


127
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,640
What stops?


128
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,160
What?


129
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,980
What stops?


130
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,080
Um


131
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,440
The um...


132
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,720
The um...


133
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,220
Oh


134
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,080
Oh


135
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,540
-I'm sorry


136
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,700
George! Those ratings are insane!


137
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,360
You're a genius!


138
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,280
Oh


139
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,640
You're a genius.


140
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,200
That's why you'd be drinking.


141
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,600
Oh


142
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,640
Well


143
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,620
because we have X-rayed you from head to toe


144
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,800
 and you don't have so much as a crap molar.


145
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,380
So


146
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,780
Uh


147
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,160
Not going on a vacation.


148
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,920
By the way


149
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,980
Um


150
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,090
Oh


151
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,900
Happy birthday.


152
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:41,290
Oh


153
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,700
Bye.


154
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,700
One moment.


155
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,800
It's just one last exam to perform.


156
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,080
I thought he said I was good to go.


157
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,660
Is there a problem?


158
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,940
No


159
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,910
You're a good candidate.


160
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,170
I mean


161
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,870
I wish you the best.


162
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,460
Lizzie?


163
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,650
Lizzie Sparkle?


164
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,880
Oh my God


165
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,170
Fred!


166
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,300
Fred


167
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,700
Oh


168
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,540
You haven't changed a bit.


169
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,950
You're still the most beautiful girl in the whole wide world.


170
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,600
You know


171
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,520
What a success.


172
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,440
I mean


173
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:40,660
Wow.


174
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,320
Hey


175
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,780
maybe for a drink sometime


176
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,920
 now that we're


177
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,840
Um...


178
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,300
Oh


179
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,340
You're super busy.


180
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,060
But you know what?


181
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,380
Why don't you give me your card?


182
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,600
I mean


183
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,160
Um


184
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,740
This will do. Oh.


185
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,070
Don't look at my cholesterol levels. They're a disaster.


186
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,820
Oh


187
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,000
What is that?


188
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,840
There.


189
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,160
Now you've got it.


190
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,380
Have you ever dreamt 


191
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,710
of a better version of yourself?


192
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,780
Younger.


193
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,770
More beautiful.


194
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,920
More perfect.


195
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:24,200
One single injection unlocks your DNA


196
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,440
starting a new cellular division


197
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,600
that will release another version of yourself.


198
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,580
This is the substance.


199
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,940
You are the matrix.


200
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,060
Everything comes from you.


201
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,960
And everything is you.


202
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,660
This is simply a better version of yourself.


203
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,450
You just have to share.


204
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,160
One week for one


205
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,640
and one week for the other.


206
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,800
A perfect balance of seven days each.


207
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,220
The one and only thing not to forget.


208
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,960
You are one.


209
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,700
You can't escape from yourself.


210
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,560
Yes.


211
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,050
Hello.


212
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,880
I'd like to order.


213
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,340
Address.


214
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,760
1057 Beverly Canyon.


215
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,800
Write this down: 35 North Byron Alley.


216
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:49,200
35 North.


217
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,160
You are the matrix.


218
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,580
Everything comes from you


219
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,180
and everything is you.


220
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,720
This is simply


221
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,460
better version of yourself.


222
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,560
Hello.


223
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,560
Thanks.


224
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,270
We'll let you know by next week.


225
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,480
Thank you so much.


226
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,430
I'm just dying to get the part.


227
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,080
Great dancer.


228
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,880
Hmm


229
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,800
Next!


230
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,640
Looks like everything sure is in the right place this time.


231
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,580
Please say your name


232
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,240
I'm Sue.


233
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,260
I'm Sue.


234
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:12,400
Sue


235
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:14,800
Sue


236
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,780
Where is she?


237
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,800
Where is she?


238
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:36,100
What a gorgeous little angel.


239
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,720
You're hired.


240
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,700
We want a show that's just like you.


241
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,320
Beautiful and happy.


242
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,160
People want to be happy.


243
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,000
We air in two weeks


244
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,660
I'm gonna let you organize the rest with my assistant. uh...


245
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,720
-uh... -Isabella?


246
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:10,760
Is-is-isis.


247
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,360
Who has time to say that?


248
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,440
We're gonna make you Cindy.


249
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,680
It's shorter


250
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:20,920
So


251
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:23,800
Oh


252
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,720
I just have to mention a...


253
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,100
small scheduling issue.


254
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,760
I have to be out of town every other week


255
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,840
to take care of my mother


256
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,780
mother


257
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:49,220
I want you for this show


258
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,740
and we will work around any mother


259
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:56,120
fucking sick


260
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,960
Hmm?


261
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,320
Hmm.


262
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:04,340
Gorgeous


263
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,000
People are gonna love that.


264
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,320
Perfect.


265
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:07,400
So you jump out


266
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:11,360
head down


267
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,880
And five


268
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,480
Where have you been?


269
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:58,620
I've all been wanting to have a drink with you for your departure.


270
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,580
Anyway


271
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,320
 we uh...all chipped in


272
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,940
and we got you just a little something to keep you busy.


273
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,060
It's French.


274
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,940
My wife


275
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,740
Oh


276
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,220
Oops


277
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,460
But it's always great to see you.


278
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:50,140
The antelope and the deer moving about


279
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,840
are going through the text.


280
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,330
The antelope with remotes.


281
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:51,360
I cannot believe the incredible price for $49.98.


282
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:38,620
God damn it


283
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:40,090
Open up.


284
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,000
We gotta open up.


285
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:48,380
And uh


286
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,060
I thought that Ms. Sparkle.


287
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:51,260
She moved out.


288
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:52,780
I'm the new tenant.


289
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:55,090
Sue.


290
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,040
Olver.


291
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,380
Over.


292
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:00,400
Oliver.


293
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:03,200
You wanted to complain about something?


294
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:04,680
Oliver?


295
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:06,550
What?


296
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:07,840
No.


297
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:10,500
No


298
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,400
I think it's


299
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:12,280
like awesome


300
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:15,740
when there's stuff going on in the building


301
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:19,680
Um


302
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:22,780
quite handy if you ever need


303
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,080
need me to be of aid in any way. Ummm...


304
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,620
I got a sack of tools and...


305
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:32,040
and a big hammer.


306
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,840
You know what I mean.


307
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:40,560
Anyways


308
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,230
so you know where to find me.


309
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:43,440
Anytime.


310
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:45,400
Day or night.


311
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,280
Later.


312
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,060
Hi everybody.


313
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:47,260
I'm Sue and it's time to pump it up.


314
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,560
Are you ready?


315
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:49,550
Let's go.


316
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,720
Thank you so much everybody.


317
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,680
I'll see you next week.


318
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,980
And in the meantime


319
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,660
take care of yourself.


320
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:38,360
courtesy!


321
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,880
Wonderful


322
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:06,450
I won't be out late


323
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:13,680
Don't eat too fast.


324
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,380
Are you all right?


325
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:34,020
Yes


326
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,640
Are you all right?


327
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:58,660
What did you do?


328
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:01,300
You've seen me the more beautiful than before.


329
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:41,720
No.


330
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:35,980
Yes.


331
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:38,080
Yes


332
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:40,560
This is Elizabeth Sparkle.


333
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:48,280
I'm 503.


334
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:49,820
Yes.


335
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:52,300
Yes


336
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:57,520
There's been a slight misuse of the substance.


337
01:02:57,830 --> 01:03:03,720
A few extra hours were accidentally used


338
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:08,400
causing umm... an alteration.


339
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:11,980
So I'm just looking for the procedure to reverse it.


340
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:16,000
What has been used on one side is lost on the other side


341
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,940
There's no going back.


342
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:27,480
No


343
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:30,200
And obviously she was drunk.


344
01:03:30,370 --> 01:03:32,620
Remember there is no she and you.


345
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:34,160
You are one.


346
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:35,770
Respect the balance


347
01:03:35,870 --> 01:03:38,210
and you won't have any more inconveniences.


348
01:04:17,330 --> 01:04:19,220
Don't you know


349
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:22,740
Don't you know


350
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:24,480
You got to pump it up


351
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:26,860
Don't you know


352
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:29,960
Don't you know


353
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:34,660
You got to pump it up


354
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:37,540
pump it up


355
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:48,000
You got to pump it up


356
01:04:50,410 --> 01:04:54,370
You got to pump it up


357
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:17,620
Sue!


358
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:19,640
Sue?


359
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,960
I just saw you on TV.


360
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:24,020
Holy moly.


361
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:27,600
Makes me want to join your class.


362
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:30,000
Hey


363
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:33,620
Hey


364
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:37,600
What about a drink at my place tonight?


365
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:40,960
Come on


366
01:05:41,330 --> 01:05:44,700
I see you standing behind the door there


367
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:48,160
All right


368
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:51,180
take your time


369
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:53,860
You know


370
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:55,900
You got to pump it up


371
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,940
You know


372
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:00,400
You got to pump it up


373
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:38,660
Sue.


374
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,740
What can I get you?


375
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:30,780
Moka Latte.


376
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:42,020
It's long


377
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:44,640
Excuse me?


378
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,380
Seven days.


379
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:22,500
Did you follow me here?


380
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:24,960
I was just curious


381
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:28,200
to find out how things were going for you.


382
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,680
Each time you feel a little more...


383
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:33,700
lonely


384
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:35,640
don't you think?


385
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,020
I don't know what you were talking about.


386
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:41,980
I'm fine.


387
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:44,760
Everything's fine.


388
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:47,280
It gets harder each time 


389
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:52,940
to remember that you still deserve to exist.


390
01:08:55,410 --> 01:08:57,560
That this part of yourself


391
01:08:57,620 --> 01:09:00,040
is still worth something


392
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:05,220
that you still matter.


393
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:11,480
Has she started yet?


394
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:15,400
Eating away at you?


395
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:33,700
Fuck!


396
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:34,880
Watch out!


397
01:09:43,540 --> 01:09:44,520
What?


398
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:55,860
Hey!


399
01:09:56,420 --> 01:09:57,240
Move!


400
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:32,320
You're still the most beautiful girl in the whole wild world.


401
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:42,260
Hello?


402
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:44,120
Hi


403
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:45,540
It's Lizzie.


404
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:49,550
Hello?


405
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,200
Sorry


406
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:53,380
Oh.


407
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:54,130
Wow.


408
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:55,510
Wow


409
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:58,160
I thought I'd never hear from you again after-...


410
01:10:58,180 --> 01:11:01,620
Oh gosh


411
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,860
I've just been really busy lately.


412
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:07,860
So listen


413
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:12,920
maybe we could get together and grab a drink?


414
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:19,700
Are you still there?


415
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:22,640
Sorry


416
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:28,340
I could book Luigi's at eight?


417
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:31,380
Ei...Ei...Eight in Luigi's it is.


418
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:34,920
Uh I... I will see you tonight.


419
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:36,780
Bye.


420
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:38,940
Okay


421
01:16:42,860 --> 01:16:44,180
Hi everybody.


422
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:45,140
Hi.


423
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:48,100
Okay


424
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:49,770
First positions


425
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:50,660
Roll cameras.


426
01:16:51,370 --> 01:16:55,440
And in three


427
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:00,860
Squat


428
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:03,540
Circle those hips.


429
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:05,340
Circle those hips.


430
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:11,480
Contract


431
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,280
head between your legs.


432
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:20,040
Cut.


433
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:28,640
I'm sorry


434
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:31,120
I just got distracted.


435
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:33,700
Not a problem


436
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:35,320
Back to one please.


437
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:39,900
Sorry


438
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:42,400
The director said he saw something bizarre on the monitor.


439
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:44,020
Bring up the replay on camera two.


440
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:45,140
Camera two.


441
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:57,300
Forward.


442
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:04,980
Can I have my dressing gown?


443
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:05,900
Sorry


444
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:07,370
Well go and and get it.


445
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:09,780
Let's just take this frame by frame.


446
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:25,740
I need five minutes.


447
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:24,340
Yes.


448
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:26,140
This balance is not working.


449
01:20:26,380 --> 01:20:28,650
I barely have anytime to enjoy myself


450
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:31,500
while she wastes seven days


451
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:33,400
stuffing her face in front of the TV.


452
01:20:33,450 --> 01:20:35,600
Remember there is no she and you.


453
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:41,280
I love everybody.


454
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:46,320
What's happening?


455
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:47,400
Where is everybody?


456
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:49,160
The TV's been canceled.


457
01:20:50,150 --> 01:20:51,860
-What


458
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:55,080
Harvey wants to see you in his office immediately.


459
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:56,460
Okay.


460
01:20:57,090 --> 01:20:58,040
I'll go change him.


461
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:59,880
No


462
01:21:17,140 --> 01:21:18,780
I'll get right to the bond.


463
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:22,190
We can't keep you on the morning show.


464
01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:25,440
But why? I just started.


465
01:21:26,180 --> 01:21:28,340
Ratings are through the roof.


466
01:21:29,330 --> 01:21:31,340
We started at 42.


467
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:34,240
Now we're up to like--


468
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:35,400
216.


469
01:21:35,420 --> 01:21:38,700
It's phenomenal!


470
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,800
People love you!


471
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:42,500
They adore you.


472
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:45,700
They want more and more and more of you.


473
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:48,000
That is why we have decided


474
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:49,580
that we want you


475
01:21:49,740 --> 01:21:53,460
to host the New Year's Eve show.


476
01:21:54,290 --> 01:21:55,500
Yoooou mean the...


477
01:21:55,540 --> 01:21:57,400
The network's biggest show.


478
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:59,780
50 million viewers live.


479
01:21:59,860 --> 01:22:02,320
You can't go higher than that.


480
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:06,060
That's gonna be intense.


481
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:08,620
We only have a few months to pull it off


482
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:10,900
are you in?


483
01:22:21,820 --> 01:22:23,840
If you don't open the door and opportunity knocks


484
01:22:23,910 --> 01:22:25,440
you won't get another chance.


485
01:22:26,830 --> 01:22:28,680
You of all people know this.


486
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:43,650
Just one more day and then I have a whole week off.


487
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:44,850
We can switch.


488
01:23:02,580 --> 01:23:04,560
We're doing the cover of Vogue.


489
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:07,300
Just one more day


490
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:18,780
-Yes.  -She didn't respect the balance.


491
01:24:18,910 --> 01:24:21,600
She's stealing more and more time from me


492
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:25,430
completely without consideration of the consequences.


493
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:27,300
She's a selfish bitch.


494
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:28,870
Would you like to stop?


495
01:24:31,410 --> 01:24:32,240
Stop.


496
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:33,700
You are the Matrix.


497
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:35,680
If you are not satisfied


498
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:37,540
you can put an end to the experience


499
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:39,950
and go back to being just you on your own.


500
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:42,280
Would you like to stop?


501
01:24:44,870 --> 01:24:47,420
Will it go back to the way it was before?


502
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,680
What has been transferred won't come back


503
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:51,340
but you can stop the experience.


504
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:53,560
As of now


505
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:56,860
To go back to being just you on your own?


506
01:24:59,280 --> 01:24:59,880
No.


507
01:25:02,450 --> 01:25:03,500
No


508
01:25:04,370 --> 01:25:05,660
I can't stop.


509
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:08,060
She just--


510
01:25:16,450 --> 01:25:18,940
The balance just needs to be respected.


511
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,340
So respected.


512
01:25:23,740 --> 01:25:27,040
Stop it


513
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:37,840
You are the winner.


514
01:25:38,210 --> 01:25:41,420
Well


515
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:43,480
We'll have one final chance


516
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:44,740
a simple question


517
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:49,040
in our big question round and play for $250


518
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:55,400
And you'll have just 45 seconds to come up...


519
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:10,100
Fuck.


520
01:27:25,220 --> 01:27:26,260
Boss.


521
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:39,760
Yes


522
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:43,280
The superstar of the moment


523
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:44,100
Are you ready?


524
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:46,780
Let's welcome her


525
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:53,520
You popped up nowhere on our screens like a tornado.


526
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:56,930
I don't think anybody was really prepared for this world.


527
01:28:04,290 --> 01:28:07,620
It all started with the morning show


528
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:12,720
and rumor has it that you are up for Tom Grant's next movie.


529
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:16,480
Wait


530
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:20,900
I'm being told that you are going to host the New Year's Eve show.


531
01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:22,410
Can you confirm this?


532
01:28:22,580 --> 01:28:23,860
Yes


533
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:25,660
Yes


534
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:31,240
Oh my God


535
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:35,400
Tell us a little bit about yourself.


536
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:36,310
Where are you from?


537
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:38,060
How did you get discovered?


538
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:41,660
I want


539
01:28:43,740 --> 01:28:49,020
Well


540
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:51,620
I'm just a girl from a


541
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:54,160
very small town in Indiana.


542
01:28:54,180 --> 01:28:56,100
I'm sure that you've never heard of it.


543
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:58,000
In fact


544
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:01,040
I'm not sure you could really even call it a village.


545
01:29:02,060 --> 01:29:04,060
It's a farm


546
01:29:10,580 --> 01:29:12,600
But ever since I can remember


547
01:29:12,620 --> 01:29:16,200
it has always been my dream to be on screen.


548
01:29:16,220 --> 01:29:18,120
This is my dream.


549
01:29:18,140 --> 01:29:20,860
As a child


550
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:22,500
Mm


551
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:24,720
How sweet.


552
01:29:26,790 --> 01:29:33,940
So


553
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:38,160
And no doubt about it


554
01:29:38,180 --> 01:29:39,760
you turned up the volume


555
01:29:39,780 --> 01:29:42,120
and you rocked their world.


556
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:44,000
Were you a fan of her show?


557
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:54,740
Um


558
01:29:54,750 --> 01:29:58,920
I can't really say that I actually watched her show.


559
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:02,990
You do know that we're not exactly from the same generation.


560
01:30:03,780 --> 01:30:05,420
And you have to admit


561
01:30:05,420 --> 01:30:07,580
it was a bit old-fashioned.


562
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:11,840
Jurassic Fitness


563
01:30:12,870 --> 01:30:15,160
the problem is it needed a change.


564
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:42,160
There is no other option.


565
01:37:08,620 --> 01:37:09,420
Sue?


566
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:22,840
Babe?


567
01:37:26,180 --> 01:37:27,120
Sue?


568
01:37:27,820 --> 01:37:28,880
You all right?


569
01:37:34,660 --> 01:37:36,620
Should I start about tomorrow?


570
01:37:41,750 --> 01:37:42,700
Babe?


571
01:37:47,940 --> 01:37:48,900
Babe?


572
01:37:56,300 --> 01:37:57,360
Sue?


573
01:37:57,940 --> 01:37:59,520
Is something wrong?


574
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:05,780
You look cranky


575
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:11,700
Sue


576
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:14,200
Come on


577
01:38:14,700 --> 01:38:16,820
not funny


578
01:38:17,940 --> 01:38:19,760
Sue


579
01:38:20,220 --> 01:38:22,120
Open the door


580
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,860
Open the door


581
01:38:53,660 --> 01:38:55,140
What the fuck?


582
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:58,200
Get the fuck out!


583
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:00,420
Who's this? Who the fuck is that?


584
01:39:00,450 --> 01:39:02,280
Leave me alone!


585
01:39:10,460 --> 01:39:12,800
What the fuck?


586
01:40:05,620 --> 01:40:06,640
Yes?


587
01:40:08,820 --> 01:40:11,820
It's 503.


588
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:14,380
I want to stop.


589
01:40:14,450 --> 01:40:15,540
Are you sure?


590
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:17,960
Once you stop


591
01:40:18,020 --> 01:40:22,080
I want to stop! I want to fucking stop!


592
01:40:22,140 --> 01:40:24,080
I want to stop!


593
01:40:24,540 --> 01:40:26,000
We'll deliver.


594
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,080
Are you sure?


595
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:41,760
Once you stop


596
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:44,620
You will simply remain on your own.


597
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:47,460
Just on your own.


598
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,880
Just on your own. on your own. on your own.


599
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:56,300
-Shut the fuck up! -Your own.


600
01:43:56,540 --> 01:43:57,540
Okay.


601
01:43:59,080 --> 01:44:02,680
I can't... I can't do this.


602
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,960
I need you.


603
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:11,220
I need myself.


604
01:44:13,980 --> 01:44:19,900
You


605
01:44:20,540 --> 01:44:22,790
Come on. They're gonna love you so much.


606
01:44:24,200 --> 01:44:25,340
Come on.


607
01:44:26,580 --> 01:44:27,520
Come on.


608
01:44:28,060 --> 01:44:32,360
You're the only lovable part of me. You have to come back.


609
01:44:32,620 --> 01:44:35,140
You have to come back. Come back.


610
01:44:50,240 --> 01:44:51,900
Okay. Okay.


611
01:44:55,820 --> 01:44:56,820
Come on.


612
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:00,400
Come on.


613
01:45:09,180 --> 01:45:10,280
Come on.


614
01:47:55,960 --> 01:47:57,220
Oh


615
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:14,380
You guys know what happened


616
01:51:14,410 --> 01:51:16,480
Here


617
01:51:16,980 --> 01:51:19,640
We have one final test on stage


618
01:51:19,660 --> 01:51:21,180
now we wait outside before show starts.


619
01:51:21,180 --> 01:51:22,040
You got it?


620
01:51:22,040 --> 01:51:22,690
-En... -You good?


621
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:23,820
Okay


622
01:51:31,900 --> 01:51:32,900
Grab it.


623
01:51:33,160 --> 01:51:34,560
Wonderful.


624
01:51:44,320 --> 01:51:46,360
There you go.


625
01:51:53,100 --> 01:51:54,200
You good?


626
01:51:54,440 --> 01:51:56,260
You gonna dance


627
01:52:01,180 --> 01:52:02,820
I'm gonna be right back


628
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:30,520
Sue! They need to see you on stage to test the light.


629
01:53:56,040 --> 01:53:57,800
Have you ever dreamt


630
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:00,900
of a better version of yourself?


631
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:05,160
More beautiful


632
01:54:05,220 --> 01:54:05,960
Sue?


633
01:54:08,180 --> 01:54:10,100
Yes


634
01:54:10,140 --> 01:54:12,340
Okay


635
01:54:28,360 --> 01:54:29,420
Sue?


636
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:35,440
Let me introduce you to the shareholders.


637
01:54:35,460 --> 01:54:38,480
They have been dying to meet you.


638
01:54:42,020 --> 01:54:46,100
Is everything...okay?


639
01:54:50,740 --> 01:54:52,480
So smile.


640
01:54:59,480 --> 01:55:02,200
That's what we want tonight.


641
01:55:03,140 --> 01:55:07,080
Pretty girls should always smile.


642
01:55:20,920 --> 01:55:23,260
Feathers! feathers! feathers!


643
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:17,120
Hey


644
01:57:06,130 --> 01:57:08,080
Would you be the better version of myself?


645
01:57:08,080 --> 01:57:11,380
Please give me a better version of myself


646
01:57:16,840 --> 01:57:18,400
Please!


647
01:57:20,040 --> 01:57:21,720
Come on!


648
01:59:15,920 --> 01:59:19,820
Looks like everything sure is in the right place this time.


649
01:59:21,880 --> 01:59:24,320
Please say your name


650
01:59:27,320 --> 01:59:28,600
I'm...


651
01:59:34,720 --> 01:59:36,540
I'm...


652
02:02:21,740 --> 02:02:25,600
Pretty girls should always smile.


653
02:03:00,180 --> 02:03:01,770
At last


654
02:03:01,870 --> 02:03:03,590
Hurry up


655
02:03:21,380 --> 02:03:23,780
There she is


656
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:26,160
We love you.


657
02:03:27,880 --> 02:03:29,400
This is where you belong.


658
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:31,080
You always belong here.


659
02:03:31,120 --> 02:03:32,340
We can't do it without you.


660
02:03:32,440 --> 02:03:34,380
We'll never do it without you.


661
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:36,620
You are here to replace them all?


662
02:04:04,460 --> 02:04:05,880
Girls


663
02:04:05,900 --> 02:04:06,920
What are we waiting for?


664
02:04:06,920 --> 02:04:10,140
-come on! -Everybody


665
02:04:13,040 --> 02:04:15,620
You will not be disappointed.


666
02:04:16,100 --> 02:04:18,380
She's my most beautiful creation.


667
02:04:18,380 --> 02:04:20,800
I have shaped her for success.


668
02:04:26,260 --> 02:04:32,700
Five


669
02:07:27,540 --> 02:07:29,400
The monster!


670
02:07:37,480 --> 02:07:39,260
Shoot the monster!


671
02:07:40,320 --> 02:07:41,940
It's a freak!


672
02:07:42,780 --> 02:07:44,600
Shoot the monster!


673
02:07:45,780 --> 02:07:47,980
-Don't be scared. -Monster!


674
02:07:47,980 --> 02:07:49,500
It's still me!


675
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:50,930
It's me.


676
02:07:51,870 --> 02:07:54,620
I'm Elizabeth


677
02:07:59,740 --> 02:08:00,820
Freak!


678
02:08:12,900 --> 02:08:17,780
Freak


679
02:08:20,840 --> 02:08:22,160
It's me.


680
02:08:24,120 --> 02:08:25,740
It's me.


681
02:08:35,020 --> 02:08:36,900
No I'm just...


682
02:09:31,120 --> 02:09:35,480
Too bad her boobs aren't in the middle of her face instead of that nose.


683
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:39,660
Next!


684
02:09:45,500 --> 02:09:48,980
Pretty girls should always smile.


685
02:09:54,080 --> 02:09:55,100
at 50.


686
02:09:55,720 --> 02:09:56,860
It stops.


687
02:12:57,800 --> 02:12:59,100
So beautiful


688
02:13:00,140 --> 02:13:01,280
We love you.
